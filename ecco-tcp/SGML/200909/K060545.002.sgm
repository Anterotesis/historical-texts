<P>PAST Four o'Clock, and a Moon|light Morning; the Company broke up; and with the Reader's Leave, as indeed it is but Good-manners, we'll &s;ee Sir <HI>Fullmatt</HI>'s Family &s;afe Home.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Martin,</HI> as he hobbled into the Hall, began by certain &s;hooting Symp|toms, to expect a &s;evere Attack in both Feet, therefore order'd his Bed to be warm'd immediately: Upon which, his Lady cou'd not help ob&s;erving, &s;he thought it was va&s;tly odd, that ever &s;ince Sir <HI>Martin</HI>'s Gout had made them lye in &s;eparate Apartments, he was always hur|rying to Bed. But I in&s;i&s;t Sir <HI>Martin</HI> before you do go, you &s;hall let me know your Opinion of <HI>Green&s;y</HI>'s Choice. For my Part, tho' I dete&s;t Scandal, I wonder what &s;ome Women are made of, to bra|zen it out as &s;he does: Well, for Effron|tery, &s;he indeed does exceed any thing I ever &s;aw.&mdash;As to her Hu&s;band, as &s;he calls him;&mdash;my God!&mdash;I'm &s;ick of Wed|lock.&mdash;The Fellow is really per&s;onal enough;&mdash;but her telling us he was a
<PB N="7" REF="8">Gentleman,&mdash;I &s;hall never love Gentility again.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Martin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is to me a Matter of much Won|der.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady <HI>Ferd.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my Dear, why &s;hou'd you wonder at what &s;ome of our Sex will do?&mdash;Why now you &s;aw fine Mi&s;s <HI>Relt</HI> To-day:&mdash;She's with Child by the Butler.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that to me is amazing; if a Lady did fall, her Pride &s;hou'd not; &mdash; methinks her own Spirit wou'd hinder her from &s;inking. If I did intrigue, it &s;hou'd be with &s;omebody of Family however.&mdash;That's what I blame my Bro|ther for; to take up with &s;uch a coar&s;e Creature as our Hou&s;e-maid <HI>Bett</HI> is;&mdash; I wonder how he can touch her filthy Fle&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<P>Young <HI>Fullmatt</HI> was nettled, to be re|proach'd for his Indelicacy of Ta&s;te; and replied to his Si&s;ter, rather too tartly. She return'd it; the Parents join'd in the Di&s;pute, and the Quarrel might have been attended with bad Con&s;equences, had not the Delinquent Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> been call'd for; and as &s;oon as &s;he enter'd, my Lady order'd her out of Doors; vow|ing,
<PB N="8" REF="9">&s;he wou'd not &s;leep under the &s;ame Roof with a Strumpet.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Family then prepared for Bed, all but young <HI>Fullmatt;</HI> he was re&s;olv'd to keep <HI>Betty</HI> Company, in the Hall Porch, till Day-light.</P>
<P>After he had every way endeavour'd to pacify the Maid; &s;wearing the Lo&s;s of her Place &s;hou'd be no Lo&s;s to her.&mdash; The Girl interrupted him, &s;obbing&mdash; that's not it Squire, thank God I don't fear to get my Living; but to be call'd Whore &s;o:&mdash;I dur&s;n't &s;ay any thing be|fore your Father, or el&s;e it was at my Tongue's End, when Madam call'd me Strumpet &s;o, and &s;pit in my Face: I cou'd have told her, ay, and Mi&s;s too; if I am one, I a'ant the only one in the Family, no that I a'ant, for all &s;he's your Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fullmatt</HI>'s Curio&s;ity was rais'd; he pre&s;s'd the Girl very &s;eriou&s;ly to ex|plain her&s;elf; and whether it was owing to Revenge, or Remor&s;e, or Friend&s;hip, every Operation of Female Di&s;po&s;itions has not yet been mathematically a&s;cer|tain'd; but &s;he led him (like <HI>Guy Fox,</HI> with a dark Lanthorn in his Hand) into that Part of the Hou&s;e, which was thought by mo&s;t of the Family to be
<PB N="9" REF="10">haunted. There lay his Mama along with the Gardener: And as fa&s;t a&s;leep, in an adjoining Room, the Bed|cloaths all to&s;s'd off, out-&s;pread was Mi&s;s <HI>Fullmatt,</HI> and his Honour's Po|&s;tillion.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Moments the E&s;quire &s;tood a&s;tound, he rubb'd his Eyes, look'd on his Si&s;ter, &s;tared at the Maid: Then treading &s;oftly on Tip-toe, he took away his Mother's, Si&s;ter's, and their Gallants Apparel; but left his own Coat in the Lad's Room: Then fa&s;tening all the other Out-lets, he placed a Light at the Top of an Entry, leading down into the Hall, from their Chambers, and &s;tood under the Windows, calling out, Fire, Fire.</P>
<P>This alarm'd the Lovers;&mdash; they &s;tarted out of Bed; &s;crambled for their Cloaths; &s;eized the fir&s;t Things that came to Hand;&mdash;and Helter-&s;kelter, Slip-&s;hod, they came tumbling into the Hall together.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fullmatt</HI> &s;tood there in the Dark, like a decoy Bird. But when, by their Voices, he found him&s;elf &s;ure of his Prey, he call'd <HI>Bett</HI> to bring Can|dles.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">The fir&s;t Figure the Light di&s;co|ver'd was Mi&s;s <HI>Fullmatt,</HI> with a Hor&s;e's Hood on; the Po&s;tillion in her Bro|ther's laced Frock; Lady <HI>Ferd,</HI> with the Gardener's Apron about her Shoul|ders; the Gardener wrapp'd in a Silk Petticoat; the E&s;quire in a Livery Jacket; and <HI>Betty</HI> in her Lady&s;hip's Negligee.</P>
<P>How they &s;tar'd at the Maid,&mdash;or how young <HI>Fullmatt</HI> look'd at them, is now impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe: For ju&s;t as their Portraits were going to be colour'd; while Shame, Sorrow, and &s;undry other Pa&s;&s;ions, alternate flu&s;h'd in their Faces, a Footman, whom the Noi&s;e of Fire had waked, and who to &s;ave his Linnen always lay in Buff, bolted naked upon them.&mdash;Such a Sight, &s;ent the Women &s;hrieking away; the E&s;quire turn'd the Fellow to Bed again; bid <HI>Bett</HI> &s;ee the Ladies &s;afe to their own Rooms, and went up Stairs to quiet the Baronet, who lay roaring and &s;wearing in a Fit of the Gout, he &s;hou'd be burn'd in his Bed.</P>
<P>Next Morning the Gardener and Lad were di&s;charg'd; and the Maid, who but the Night before was not &s;uffer'd to &s;leep in the Hou&s;e, took Place of all her
<PB N="11" REF="12">fellow Servants, by the Title of my Lady's Woman.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Martin</HI> heard of this, he cou'd not account for it.&mdash;But as my Lady permitted him to know only as much as &s;he thought proper of dome|&s;tic Occurrences, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with remarking,&mdash;that there are &s;udden Changes in private Families, as well as Kingdoms, beyond the Ken of keene&s;t Politicians.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP III.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many well-dre&s;s'd Vi&s;itants, Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> on the Ac|count of his Marriage, had the Honour of being Gentleman U&s;her to, one La|dy (as he offer'd her his Hand) with a Sigh, tenderly looking at him in a plaintive Tone, whi&s;pered: What, Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> have you forgot me? <HI>Tom</HI> blu&s;h'd, bowed, his Heart beat quick; with down-ca&s;t Look, he reply'd, No, Ma|dam, nor ever &s;hall I, and trembling, he led her into the Parlour.</P>
<P>The Reader may &s;uppo&s;e this Lady to be Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h;</HI> it was indeed&mdash;the late Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h:</HI> She had given her Hand to the Right Honourable Lord <HI>Pillow:</HI>&mdash; For Lady Dowager&mdash;but to pre&s;erve the Unity of our Drama, we mu&s;t beg Leave to return, To the</P>
<P><HI>Hi&s;tory of Patchwork.</HI></P>
<P>In the Conclu&s;ion of the Chapter of Gho&s;ts, Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> wrapp'd up in the Roquelaure, barefooted limp'd to his Lodgings; Mi&s;s <HI>Ma&s;k</HI> took Po&s;t Chai&s;e that Evening for <HI>London;</HI> E&s;quire <HI>Sin|gleten</HI> went to the Chri&s;topher's to drink

<P><HI>Batilda</HI> and her <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, in three or four Days, &s;et out for <HI>London;</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> with them, unlover'd. Such an univer&s;al Di&s;&s;ipation then reign'd at <HI>Bath,</HI> that a Lady of her Figure, Ele|gance, Wit, and &s;trong Sen&s;ations, was neglected, for the more fa&s;cinating Ex|cerci&s;e of the E O Table.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> and <HI>Matilda,</HI> who grew re|markably intimate, &s;taid at <HI>Bath,</HI> and E&s;quire <HI>Singleten</HI> with them. This la&s;t-mentioned Gentleman made &s;trong Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip to <HI>Junior;</HI> and be|hind his Back was as eager in his Pro|te&s;tations of Love to <HI>Matilda;</HI> nay, the E&s;quire proffer'd to make her a very hand&s;ome Settlement. This &s;he told <HI>Junior,</HI> who advi&s;ed her by all Means to accept of the Conditions; for, as he ob|&s;erved, Con&s;tancy was no Money-getting Virtue, Plea&s;ure &s;he might keep always in waiting&mdash;but 300 l. a Year was not an every Day Vi&s;itor. As he &s;poke like a Man of Sen&s;e, and one who knew the World, and the be&s;t Way to live in it, &s;he was ruled by him. Therefore, with her Con&s;ent, he borrowed for his own U&s;e 500 Pieces of the E&s;quire; then, like
<PB N="14" REF="15">a Man of Honour, put the Lady into the Lender's Hands as a Security.</P>
<P>With that Sum <HI>Junior</HI> intending to &s;trike a bold Stroke, &s;et up an Equipage; and as it was Ta&s;te then, to be waited on by foreign Servants, he hired a <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Frenchman</HI> (its all the fame in the <HI>Greek</HI>) for his Valet. <HI>Junior</HI> called him a <HI>Swi&s;s;</HI> indeed as <HI>England</HI> was then at War with <HI>France,</HI> he would not be thought &s;o Anti-Antigallican, as to che|ri&s;h an Enemy; differently thought his Servant, he knew him&s;elf to be a Sub|ject, and Slave of the Grand Monarch; that it was his Duty to make Repri&s;als upon his King's Enemies; taking the Advantage of his Ma&s;ter's coming Home late one Evening, and very much in Li|quor, he plunder'd him of all his Ca&s;h, Watch, Ring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with the Dex|terity common to that Nation, eluded his Pur&s;uers. This Misfortune threw <HI>Junior</HI> into Pri&s;on, where he met with <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> as related in the fir&s;t Part, as Reference being had thereto, will more fully appear.</P>

<P>BY the Help of his faithful <HI>Amy,</HI> he gain'd his Liberty; but ingrateful|ly contracted an Acquaintance with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Jewe&s;s, who formerly had been a celebrated Woman of the Town, but of late Years, hawk'd Trinkets about at Coffee-hou&s;es.

<P><HI>Junior</HI> run up the Stairs to the Place from whence the Noi&s;e i&s;&s;ued, and the Women followed him.</P>
<P>The Doctor, Rider, and Landlord, kept their Seats&mdash;the Inn-keeper, in|deed, once &s;aid, he wou'd go up to take care of his Wife&mdash;but the other two ob&s;erving, he was hang'd who left his Liquor behind him, the Motion was over-ruled.</P>
<P><HI>Junior,</HI> on bur&s;ting open the Cham|ber-Door, di&s;cover'd the Cook-maid bare-headed; her di&s;hevell'd Locks bri&s;t|ling about her Ears; in one Hand &s;he gra&s;p'd a pewter Chamber-pot, and in the other waved a Piece of Linnen, which &s;eem'd to be Part of a Shirt Sleeve; under the Bed lay the Long-winded-grace-&s;ayer, like a large Turtle; his Hands and Head only to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Landlady &s;harply enquired into this Confu&s;ion; the Girl, with much
<PB N="20" REF="21">blubbering, declared it was all upon Account of that <HI>Scotch</HI> Dog: For that, as how, upon her Honour, he wou'd have ravi&s;hed her: Had not <HI>Junior</HI> took the Delinquent's Part, they wou'd have pulled the poor Pedlar to Pieces&mdash;but they were at la&s;t prevail'd on to retire; which they did along with the Cook-wench, to hear every minute Circum|&s;tance of the intended Rape.</P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Macdugle</HI> was enough re|covered to return Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> Thanks, thus he delivered him&s;elf. As I have a Sol tull be &s;aved, I&s;e tall ye the hale Truth, gued Sir. Sawton got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion o'me this Afternoon, for ye ken unco|well, Sir, how he gangs aboot, like a roaring Lion: And I &s;tud in his Wa. Don na ye remamber how that wacked Loon, like Tyke, tawked Blo&s;phomy, aboot Prayer and Grace. Oh tis aw oer wi us, when Grace gangs oot on us. Weel, weel Sir, I gang'd my Gate, and and &s;peerd my Prayer-buke. Than as Beelzabub wood ha it, this Katchen Whore &s;tepped intull my Room, to clap her Cap on her Hede.&mdash;Sawton as I tald ye before was a're &s;trong in me,&mdash; and mad me hold a parle wi her;&mdash;wo worth the Time tho'.

<P>On that In&s;tant the tarni&s;h'd Jacket Lady enter'd, and reproach'd the <HI>North Britain</HI> with Indelicacy, for attempting to force the Wench. For, Sir (turning to <HI>Junior</HI>) Women are not to be ravi&s;h'd, we are free Agents, and Compul&s;ion is incompatible with our Pa&s;&s;ions. We may be won; for, as the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI> (who was a Relation of mine) u&s;ed to &s;ay, if a Town is open at Top, it may be taken.&mdash;So may our Sex; we are open&mdash;we are to be taken. But, Sir, I &s;hould be pleas'd, if you'd retire with me, from this Scene of Confu&s;ion; for as I hear your Name is <HI>Junior,</HI> there is &s;omething in that Name which alarms my Soul. They withdrew, and after
<PB N="22" REF="23">interchanging a few Que&s;tions, &s;he di&s;|cover'd her&s;elf, to be the identical Lady <HI>Senior,</HI> &s;ecreted among the Gip&s;ies.</P>
<P>If <HI>Junior</HI> was plea&s;ed at finding his Parent, the Lady was no le&s;s rejoiced at meeting her Son. The whole Hou&s;e was rejoiced, and the Evening conclu|ded with that exqui&s;ite E&s;&s;ential to <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Happine&s;s, a General Drinking Rout.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT Day, after <HI>Junior</HI> had in|form'd his Mother of the materi|al Incidents he had been engaged in, &s;he, in return, began her Story as follows.</P>
<P>To have you torn from my Arms, to be brought up as a Gip&s;y, &s;hock'd me &s;o e&s;&s;entially, I re&s;olv'd to quit the hor|rid Crew. I found an A&s;&s;ylum at an elderly Gentleman's, a Batchelor, his Name was <HI>Sear,</HI> he had made a great Figure formerly in the Beau Monde; and had enjoyed, as he often told me him&s;elf, all the fine Women of his Age; for he was a va&s;t Wit, and it was not then, as it is now, impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to be a Wit, and a fine Gentleman to|gether. He had been a perfect Hero in his Time; he kept the very be&s;t Com|pany, &s;pent two great E&s;tates, and was the Terror of all the <HI>London</HI> Watchmen. His Courage and Genero&s;ity were im|men&s;e; and &s;uch a Spirit,&mdash;my God&mdash; why he'd make nothing of betting 500 l. at a Hor&s;e-race; but &s;uch is the Fate of all &s;ublunary Beings; he, who u&s;ed to keep three or four Coaches and Six, had now only a Foot-walk to keep him; for when I began my Connection with him,
<PB N="24" REF="25">he was only an Exci&s;eman; but, like <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> I lov'd him for the Dan|gers he had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I was indeed younger than I am now; but I had not acquired that Ea&s;e of Fi|gure I at pre&s;ent enjoy. Yet it &s;eems, the Infancy of my Bloom made an Im|pre&s;&s;ion on his Heart. In this Cohabi|tation I exi&s;ted about half a Year; and, by way of Amu&s;ement, I in&s;tructed an elderly Lady's Foot-boy (in whom I di&s;|cover'd a va&s;t Genius) to write and read.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sear,</HI> my Spou&s;e, having Notice that his Friend and Patron, the Collec|tor, wou'd be down in a Day or two, inform'd me of it. I was therefore more than ordinary a&s;&s;iduous about my Ap|pearance, when I knew &s;o great a Man as the Collector was to wait upon us; for modern Examples, as well as antient Hi&s;tory, had inform'd me, a hand&s;ome Wife was a Hu&s;band's Sheet-Anchor; therefore, for my Spou&s;e's Sake, I prac|tis'd all my Attractions. But I had been given up before-hand&mdash;for the Lad, whom, I ob&s;erv'd to you, I took under In&s;tructions, di&s;clo&s;ed a horrid Plot to me; it &s;eems my pre&s;ent Incumbent had agreed to part with me, provided the Collector liked me; this Provi&s;o &s;hock'd me; I was determin'd to di&s;appoint
<PB N="25" REF="26">them:&mdash;Was I not born free? And &s;hou'd I be traffick'd for? Nay, left to a Wretch's Option? No.&mdash;Had this Gen|tleman, or any other Gentleman, in a polite Way, made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of my Honour; either by &s;urprizing me from a Morning's Dream, or &s;tealing on me in an Evening's Solitude, it was to be forgiven: But to be offer'd like dead Game, as a Gift; nay, to have the Chance of a Negative:&mdash;No&mdash;(<HI>Pinch</HI> 20th) peri&s;h me, if my Soul di&s;dain'd not the Motion.&mdash;I left him&mdash;the Lad and I took Places in the Waggon for <HI>London.</HI> On my Arrival there, I applied for Em|ployment among the Book&s;ellers; and really pick'd up a very pretty Living, by writing Things again&s;t the Govern|ment. Not Child that I was di&s;affected &mdash;far from it&mdash;but we mu&s;t eat;&mdash; and any Thing on t'other Side didn't &s;ell &s;o well.</P>
<P>The young Man whom I brought to <HI>London,</HI> my <HI>Adonis</HI> as I u&s;ed to call him, &s;oon died of a gallopping Con&s;umpti|on; the foul Fogs of <HI>London</HI> were too heavy for the Delicacy of his Frame. I was incon&s;olable, nay, &s;hou'd certainly have followed him, had not my Land|lady introduced a <HI>Jew</HI> Gentleman to my Acquaintance. He took Lodgings for
<PB N="26" REF="27">me at <HI>Hachney;</HI> and tho' I was under infinite Obligation to him; yet, peri&s;h me, (<HI>Pinch</HI> 30th) if I cou'd ever aggregate my Ideas to any Complacency for him. I was con&s;cious he was an Infidel; nor <HI>Junior,</HI> cou'd I ever have believ'd, that any Exi&s;tence, &s;prung from my Womb, wou'd &s;o gro&s;sly have deba&s;ed the Dig|nity of his Specie, as you have done, by your Cohe&s;ion with this <HI>Jew</HI> Woman.&mdash; For me, I wou'd &s;ooner go to Bed to a Chri&s;tian, &s;upperle&s;s, than be kept by the riche&s;t Wretch in <HI>England,</HI> that did not believe in the New Te&s;tament.&mdash;I &s;oon retreated from &s;uch an irreligious Acquaintance.</P>
<P>A Gentleman belonging to the Law had Lodgings in the &s;ame Hou&s;e we were in. He was a great Free-thinker, and talk'd to me concerning the Eterni|ty of Matter, of the Soul's Materiality, and Divi&s;ibility; and why Rea&s;on and Religion were incompatible. I was fa&s;|cinated with his Di&s;cour&s;e, for his Tongue dropp'd Manna. With him I came to <HI>London;</HI> for he was a Coun&s;ellor and &s;olicitor in Se&s;&s;ions Time, at <HI>Ju&s;tice Hall;</HI> and while he follow'd the Court, I be|gan to compile a Treati&s;e, on the Ab|&s;urdity of Faith without Demon&s;tration. But my Ideas not being &s;ufficiently ar|ranged,
<PB N="27" REF="28">the Coun&s;ellor, my Spou&s;e, brought me all the be&s;t Authors, &s;uch as <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI>'s Travels; <HI>Wool&s;ton</HI> again&s;t Miracles; Chri&s;tianity as old as the Cre|ation; the Infallibility of human Judg|ment; the Oracles of Rea&s;on; and &s;e|veral more of the famous Champions of the rational Side of the Que&s;tion. By their Help I tickled up as pretty a Piece of Metaphy&s;ics, as ever laid Ax to the Root of Prie&s;t-craft. But before it was publi&s;hed, &s;ome Enemies of my Hu&s;band's pretending he had forg'd a Seaman's Will and Powers, had him ta|ken up; and we wanting Money at that Time, to do Things as we &s;hou'd do in re&s;pect of Evidence, contrary to the Laws of what &s;hou'd be right and wrong, he &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>But I'll leave you to gue&s;s, my dear Son, how much I was amazed when I came to comfort him the Evening af|ter he was ca&s;t, to &s;ee the New Te&s;ta|ment in his Hand.&mdash;He,&mdash;even he; who had made &s;o great a Je&s;t of reveal'd Religion in his Pro&s;perity.&mdash;I was fright|ed to hear him call out for Mercy; wringing his Hands, and crying, What wou'd become of him in the next World? When he u&s;ed, by mathematical Inve&s;ti|gations,
<PB N="28" REF="29">formerly to prove to me, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of there being one.</P>
<P>After his Decea&s;e, the Ordinary took me as his Hou&s;e-keeper. I then &s;up|pre&s;s'd my Treati&s;e of Materiali&s;m, and put forth a Di&s;&s;ertation on the Condition of &s;till-born Infants, in a future State; and dedicated it to the Hutchin&s;onians. A Romi&s;h Gentleman, who u&s;ed &s;ome|times to vi&s;it the Pri&s;oners under Sen|tence, came often to our Hou&s;e; we had &s;everal logical Di&s;putes; he fell in Love with me, and promi&s;ed me to turn Pro|te&s;tant, if I wou'd go with him.&mdash;To &s;ave a Soul I did &s;o. We went to <HI>York</HI> together; where Money being &s;carce, he was oblig'd to leave <HI>England</HI> for trying to make more. He left me big of my third Child. When I was up, having had &s;o much Experience, I practi&s;ed Midwifery, for my Genius was always exten&s;ive; but &s;till I &s;igh'd for <HI>London.</HI> Con&s;cious &s;uch a Per&s;on as I had, and &s;uch Abilities &s;hou'd not be bury'd in the Country; therefore Ireturn'd to Town, and re&s;umed my Pen. But the Sy&s;tem of writing was alter'd.&mdash;The Town from Politicians were turn'd Electrifiers. I &s;oon made my&s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of every atmo&s;pherical Experiment. In con&s;e|quence of which, I &s;et about a Sy&s;tem,
<PB N="29" REF="30">wherein I form'd a Proce&s;s of extracting from the aetherial Fluid, an efficient Quantity of pure inflamable Rays of Heat; which, when collected into con|cave Speculums of different Diameters, placed at right Angles, wou'd form a Focus, &s;trong enough to de&s;troy any Enemy's Fleet in Harbour&mdash;and I pre|&s;ented this Project to the Sun-fire Office for their In&s;pection.</P>
<P>I was prevented from putting my De|&s;ign in Execution, by the Owners of Salt|petre, and Gunpowder makers; &mdash; they &s;etting forth in their Ca&s;e, that as they had, with great Co&s;t and Pains, and &s;olely for the Good of their Country, pre|pared Combu&s;tibles enough to de&s;troy the whole World, or any Part thereof, at a Week's Warning: Therefore they remon&s;trated, that if Lightning was once brought into common U&s;e, all their va&s;t Stocks of ready-made De&s;truction wou'd lye dead upon their Hands, to the great Lo&s;s of them&s;elves and Families.</P>
<P>Then I began a Compendium of Na|tural Philo&s;ophy; wherein I prov'd, be|yond Contradiction, that there never were &s;uch Things as Mermaids. I &s;hew'd demon&s;tratively, that <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> and Mount <HI>Hecla,</HI> could have no Communication. I proved, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Way of rub|bing
<PB N="30" REF="31">two Sticks together, to make Fire, was an Antediluvian Invention. Then I wrote a Hi&s;tory of the Fly, call'd a Blue Bottle; and a Di&s;&s;ertation proving the Antiquity of our Marrow-bones and Cleaver Mu&s;ic; that they came from the Pyrrhic Dances of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> &s;triking their Spears and Shields together. And in a Supplement I confuted Mr. <HI>Swam|merdam;</HI> &s;hewing, that the Grubs in <HI>Lapland</HI> are no ways related to the Gnats in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire Fens.</HI>&mdash;This Work, which would have made &s;ix Vol. in Fo|lio, I intended to have publi&s;h'd, with &s;everal Copper-plates; but the Graving coming dear, I laid it by, and re&s;olv'd again&s;t any more being concern'd in Writings of Con&s;equence; &s;o, ju&s;t to kill Time, I abridged the Works of the Learned.</P>
<P>My Printer's younge&s;t Prentice, who u&s;ed to bring me the Proof of Sheets, had acted in &s;everal private Plays, and wou'd often repeat Speeches to me. Now you mu&s;t know, Child, I have a &s;trong theatrical Genius; but not &s;o much for Acting, as for writing Plays.&mdash;Not but I believe, if the Managers and I could have agreed, I &s;hould have exhibited in about half a Score of <HI>Cibber</HI>'s, or <HI>Wof|fington</HI>'s, or <HI>Pritchard</HI>'s Parts.&mdash;But
<PB N="31" REF="32">there happened at this Time to be a Dearth of dramatic Writers, therefore I undertook to manure and fertilize the Theatres.</P>
<P>Don't imagine me vain, Child, I was qualified for this Undertaking. I had read over <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and all the <HI>French</HI> Critiques; and wou'd have &s;uffer'd Mar|tyrdom, &s;ooner than wrote any Thing in Violation of the Unities. I am con&s;ci|ous <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Writings are crept into &s;ome E&s;timation. Yet you &s;ee no dra|matic Writer now chu&s;es to copy him&mdash; his Flights are bold, but very irregular, to be &s;ure. Indeed, con&s;idering the Time he lived in, and his being unac|quainted with the Cla&s;&s;ics, &s;ome of his Pieces are pretty enough,&mdash;but rude tho',&mdash;his Clowns for In&s;tance&mdash;they are ab&s;olutely incongruous, to the Polite&s;&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Drama; for it mu&s;t be granted, that every Thing which is quite comic, mu&s;t be quite low; there|fore not fit for the Delicacy of the Boxes &mdash;&s;o I turn'd the Merry Wives of <HI>Wind|&s;or</HI> into a Tragedy,&mdash;got a great Man's Letter, and it was put into Rehear&s;al.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I had then to do, was to in&s;ert proper Paragraphs in the Pa|pers; for Adverti&s;ements are as nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the Town, as Phy&s;ic is before
<PB N="32" REF="33">Inoculation. Puffing for a Thing, is as e&s;&s;ential as the Thing it&s;elf.&mdash;I have, in my Time, puffed three or four Players into very good Salaries.&mdash;I &s;corn to ca|lumniate.&mdash;But what did I ever get in Return?&mdash;Not this Pinch of <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> peri&s;h me.&mdash;No matter!&mdash;Gratitude is not a concomitant Characteri&s;tic in thea|tric Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty's Death &s;hutting up the Hou&s;es, my Tragedy was po&s;tpon'd&mdash; but hold, I am premature in my Story. I was mentioning about our Printer's Prentice rehear&s;ing &s;everal Parts of Plays with me. One Day, by a Fatality the greate&s;t Metaphy&s;ician never cou'd ac|count for, as we were performing the Couch Scene of <HI>Lovele&s;s</HI> and <HI>Berinthia,</HI> I granted him the la&s;t Favour. Some|what hung over me, impelling me, as it were, and made &s;uch Actions unavoi|dable. His Youth and Eagerne&s;s made me forgive him; his Obedience and A&s;|&s;iduity made me doat on him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was out of his Time, we were lawfully marry'd; till unluckily taking Lodgings for the Air in <HI>Moor|feilds,</HI> he became acquainted with &s;ome of the Tabernacle Preachers there; they thunder'd &s;o much in his Head about Sin, and &s;uch Stuff, I was forced to put
<PB N="33" REF="34">him among the Incurables. I then found a Friend, in the Gentleman with whom I am at pre&s;ent. He's a Phy&s;ician,&mdash;it is true indeed he travels:&mdash;What then? 'Tis his Humanity only that wakes him keep a Stage. People in every Town pre&s;s him to &s;ettle with them; but as I and my Hu&s;band tell them, if he was confin'd to one Spot, what mu&s;t become of the re&s;t of <HI>England?</HI> For Country Doctors and Apothecaries are &s;o igno|rant,&mdash;my God! And yet to &s;ee the Force of Genius: The Doctor took it all him&s;elf, he was not bred up to it: His Father is only a Ticket Porter.&mdash;What then? The Parent of <HI>Socrates</HI> made Barbers Blocks.</P>

<P>THE next Day <HI>Junior</HI> and his La|dy prepared to &s;et forward. But as Mrs. <HI>Slym&s;traat</HI> was putting up her Things, &s;he di&s;covered the Doctor's Wife and the Merry Andrew in a too familiar Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>When <HI>Junior</HI> heard of this, he took his Mother a&s;ide, to expo&s;tulate with her: But &s;he interrupted him, &s;aying,&mdash; Child, there is an e&s;&s;ential Di&s;tinction be|tween voluntary Sin, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of acting. As for what happened between me and <HI>Robin,</HI> it was no more than an Accident of Matter; I was lo&s;t in Re|flection. It was not criminal in me, I was merely pa&s;&s;ive, therefore not cul|pable, becau&s;e not intentionally guilty: But as for that Infidel to reproach me with want of Ta&s;te; me,&mdash;no <HI>Junior,</HI> I love you as much as a Mother ought, but never &s;ee my Face again, unle&s;s you part from that Unbeliever. Then in|&s;tantly bridling her&s;elf up, &s;he &s;talk'd out of the Room with the Straddle, To&s;s, and Importance of an <HI>Haymarket Signiora,</HI> after fini&s;hing a <HI>Da Capo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"><HI>Junior</HI> appeared at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> to be quite the Thing. He dre&s;s'd gay, drank deeply, play'd high, &s;wore ele|gantly, and &s;ung drolly. He was Ma|&s;ter of Arts in Sentiment-making; had all Odds <HI>ad Unguem.</HI> As for the Pedi|gree of a Plate Hor&s;e, he was a critical Genealogi&s;t.</P>
<P>He took Care to make much Parade of his Honour, therefore was thought to be one of very &s;trict Principle:&mdash;For it was his Maxim, that, according to the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion which you make upon the Company, thro' that Medium you will be afterwards look'd at.</P>
<P>Among the many Per&s;onages who ex|hibited them&s;elves at the Wells that Sea|&s;on, there was a Per&s;on, who by his Addre&s;s &s;eem'd to be a Gentleman. He was allow'd to be a very &s;en&s;ible Man, by an Ob&s;ervation or two which he made at a Picture Sale, the Day he came down.&mdash;He was allow'd to be very rich too&mdash;Yet &s;o great an Oddity, he never went to the Gaming Table, rarely to the Tavern, and then not a Word of Politics &s;lipt from him.&mdash;He &s;eem'd very fond of reading, which made the very polite Company there fancy he had crack'd his Brain by Study.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">The inqui&s;itive Club had been very bu&s;y in enquiring after him.&mdash;A Club, where Scandal,&mdash;but why &s;hou'd Spleen fall from a Poet's Pen?&mdash;No; it is proper &s;ome People &s;hou'd meddle with other Peoples Bu&s;ine&s;s. It is the Duty we owe our Country, a Duty we owe our Neigh|bours, a Duty we own our&s;elves, to be a&s;&s;iduous in our Que&s;tions; not only concerning Per&s;ons we don't know, but more e&s;pecially to examine into every Report that is propagated of Intrigue, or Male-practices, in our Friends and tho&s;e we do know.</P>
<P><HI>Junior,</HI> who&s;e Scheme was to make all the Acquaintance he cou'd among money'd Men, judg'd this Gentleman well worth knowing; and &s;oon made the Stranger's Temper his Study.&mdash;For like <HI>Alcibiades, Jack</HI> cou'd be any thing, with any Man.</P>

But <HI>Tully,</HI> in his Treati&s;e upon Rhetoric, doubting whether Oratory was more an Advantage or Detriment to the State, I became irre&s;olute;&mdash;nay, &s;oon relin|qui&s;h'd it, de&s;pairing to excel in what <HI>Cicero</HI> was found Fault with, both by <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Quintilian.</HI></P>
<P>Yet bent to pur&s;ue the Good of my Country, I attended Borough Jobbing. but a Change in the Mini&s;try forcing me to have all my Work to do over again, I grew tired of &s;o precarious an Employment; went once more to my Books, and immer&s;ed my&s;elf in ancient Philo&s;ophy.&mdash;What a Parcel of Ab&s;ur|dities did I there meet with! Every Fel|low at that time of Day, with an over|heated Imagination, or po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of inve|terate Rancour, &s;et up for a Sy&s;tem-maker. There required not much Ca|pital to begin with; they open'd their Opinions, and the World at once be|came their Cu&s;tomers. For altho' there is not any thing to be conceiv'd more ridiculous, than what the Sectari&s;ts of all Ages have in their Turns a&s;&s;erted; yet &s;uch is the Weakne&s;s, Wilfulne&s;s, and Vanity of human Kind, they are
<PB N="39" REF="40">&s;ure to find Followers, Believers, and Defenders.</P>
<P>Like a Town Lady, on her fir&s;t Coun|try Vi&s;it, I &s;oon grew tired of my Com|pany; &s;hifted my Quarters into the planetary Sy&s;tem, and found the Study of A&s;tronomy very much to my Satis|faction. I lectured upon the Orrery, explain'd Attraction, &s;ettled the Comets Routs, accounted for the Winds and Tides, pervaded thro' the milky Way, a&s;&s;ign'd Cau&s;es <HI>&agrave; Priori,</HI> and boldly and technically an&s;wer'd for all the Motions of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>I grew very fond of the Di&s;coveries I made nightly in the Moon: For having <HI>Stevelius</HI>'s Map of that Planet; by that, and from what he had wrote upon it, cou'd by the help of my Gla&s;&s;es, &s;ee very plainly upon her Surface, Rivers, Rocks, Towns, Trees, and Churches. But af|terwards, reading <HI>Hugenius,</HI> he contra|dicted all the Moonland Di&s;coveries; nay, proves it is not po&s;&s;ible for us to di&s;cover any Objects on her Di&s;k. I confe&s;s, after weighing his Arguments, all my former pretty Pro&s;pects vani&s;h'd;&mdash;I cou'd not find one Picture on the Moon's Face, I had formerly fancy'd there.&mdash;Away went my Tele&s;copes.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">Then I became eager to &s;tudy Hi&s;|tory: But by their own Accounts, anci|ent Authors are not much to be depended upon, and Moderns too often mi&s;led by the Rage of Party, religious Prejudices, or Partialities to their own Country. Determined no more to depend on what others had &s;aid, but re&s;olv'd to &s;earch into the Nature of Things my&s;elf, I erected a Laboratory. I was at fir&s;t fond of <HI>Galen,</HI>&mdash;till meeting with the Work of <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI>&mdash;left off my fir&s;t Ma&s;ter:&mdash;But I as &s;oon grew &s;ick of the Second; when I found even this <HI>Para|cel&s;us,</HI> who ridicules <HI>Galen</HI> &s;o much, and who promi&s;ed him&s;elf va&s;t Riches and Longevity from his rare Secrets, die in&s;olvent between forty and fifty. From him, I turn'd to <HI>Van Helmont;</HI> but read|ing his Proce&s;s upon the four Porters,&mdash;I threw all my chymical Volumes into the Furnace, gave the whole Furniture of my Laboratory to the Work-hou&s;e, and turn'd my Speculations to Phy&s;ic. That I did not attend long, di&s;gu&s;ted at not being able to account for animal Secretion.</P>
<P>In vain I read, and it was as much in vain for me to enquire: They told me indeed, that the Stomach, like the Load|&s;tone, was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of occult Qualities.
<PB N="41" REF="42">That I granted, but was determin'd not to pur&s;ue a Study, where we cou'd not come to a Demon&s;tration of its fir&s;t and grand Principle.</P>
<P>To di&s;&s;ipate the Chagreen, which the In&s;ufficiency of the&s;e Pur&s;uits had occa|&s;ion'd, I undertook Mu&s;ic. When I heard the Compo&s;itions of the great Ma|&s;ters, they tran&s;ported me; I no longer wonder'd at the extravagant Effects Poets a&s;crib'd to the Power of Sounds. I im|mediately became Con&s;ort Hunter;&mdash;&s;tudied Compo&s;itions, and cou'd reli&s;h no Companions, but tho&s;e who under|&s;tood the Nature of Uni&s;ons; but was ve|ry much &s;urpriz'd to find that mo&s;t mu&s;ical Performers look'd with Di&s;dain on the Profe&s;&s;ors of every Art and Science but their own. Yet, except in their own, they are the mo&s;t incurious and unenter|taining of any other Arti&s;ts. Nay, even in the very Branch they excel, you mu&s;t tire your&s;elf with reque&s;ting, before they'll exhibit: But when once they be|gin, they know not how to &s;top, but are as palling, by doing too much, as they were di&s;gu&s;tful before by not doing any thing. I bid adieu to the Gamut, lea&s;t it &s;hou'd lead me into the &s;ame Infatuation.</P>
<P>My next Attempt was extremely amu&s;ing.&mdash;I &s;tudied Painting and
<PB N="42" REF="43">Sculpture, but was &s;hock'd at the un|friendly Treatment, &s;everal Men of Me|rit-gave their Contemporaries.</P>
<P>I had like to have tumbled over Head and Ears into the Tide of Ta&s;te, and be|come Picture-fancier, Auction-hunter, and Connoi&s;&s;eur. But as I had &s;tudied with|out travelling, my Opinions were not of equal Weight, with tho&s;e who had tra|vell'd without &s;tudying.</P>
<P>The better to judge of Sculpture, and &s;ome parts of Painting, I found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to apply my&s;elf to Anatomy; and as that, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, is connected with both natural and experimental Phi|lo&s;ophy, I &s;oon gave my&s;elf up entirely to the Inve&s;tigations of Nature. I dragg'd the Ditches for Embryo's, com|mitted Burglary upon the Habitations of half-form'd In&s;ects, &s;tripp'd Trees of their Mo&s;s, examin'd Puff-balls, and &s;earch'd for the Heads of Snake Stones.</P>
<P>I have &s;een, Sir, the Circulation of Blood in a Frog's Toes, Spider's Leg; and a Shrimp's Tail. I have counted the Number of blue Animals a Sloe has upon its Surface, and knew accurately, what Pen-feathers there were in a But|terfly's Wing.</P>
<P>Many curious Ob&s;ervations have I made upon Duck-weed, and Dung|hill-water,
<PB N="43" REF="44">and the &s;everal <HI>Animalcula</HI> in each.</P>
<P>I have impaled Gnats upon Pins, to try how long they cou'd live without eating. Have pre&s;s'd Wood-lice and Silk-worms to Death, to di&s;cover their &s;eminal <HI>Ani|malcula;</HI> and de&s;troy'd many Colonies of Ants, to be certain whether they did, or did not bite off the Ends of the Corn. I have attended the micro&s;copical Di&s;&s;ec|tions of Bugs, to re&s;olve that grand Debate among the Learned; whether they were or were not Hermaphrodites. I have al&s;o open'd Batts, to authenticate what Genius they &s;hou'd be cla&s;s'd un|der, Birds, or Bea&s;ts.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir,&mdash;ju&s;t as much as making your Fences in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Manner wou'd improve your E&s;tate.&mdash;Yet &s;o far is Prejudice prevailing, that were we to deride &s;uch Pur&s;uits, all the minute Phi|lo&s;ophers wou'd be alarm'd, and our Treatment wou'd be as &s;evere, as if at <HI>Madrid,</HI> we &s;hou'd rea&s;on again&s;t Saint-wor&s;hiping.&mdash;I own, I have been a&s;to|ni&s;h'd at beholding Millions of Beings, &s;maller than the &s;malle&s;t Grain of Sand;
<PB N="44" REF="45">&s;kimming upon the Water, &s;ailing along the Air, and circulating in our fine&s;t Fluids. I a&s;k'd my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly what the&s;e cou'd be for.&mdash;That <HI>For,</HI> was my Gordian Knot.</P>
<P>I determin'd to find out a Man of Sen&s;e, to whom I cou'd communicate my Doubts; and by comparing our O|pinions, we might come to know, why, and for what End the&s;e Things were &s;o.&mdash;I related my De&s;ign to the only &s;ur|viving Relation I have, a prodigious Humouri&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had heard me out,&mdash;he &s;hook his Head, (methinks I &s;ee him now) and reply'd,&mdash;Oh, Nephew, Ne|phew, before you endeavour to account for the Deity's Actions, regulate your own. Don't begin the Study of Wi&s;dom at the wrong End; like &s;ome of our Folks of Fa&s;hion, who are &s;ent Abroad, before they &s;ee their own Country.&mdash;Receive Things as they are, u&s;e them as they &s;hou'd be; employ your Talents in prai&s;e-worthy Exerci&s;es; but throw not away your Time in vain Specula|tions, like the thir&s;ty Lunatic, who, when he arrived at a River, in&s;tead of quench|ing his Thir&s;t, lo&s;t him&s;elf in looking for the Spring-head.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">I made him a Bow, thanked him for his Advice, promis'd him to con&s;ider of it, but left the Room, and my Pro|mi&s;e behind me;&mdash;like a Lover, who reque&s;ts his Friend's Opinion, tho' he is already determin'd&mdash;I &s;et out upon my Travels immediately, to &s;earch for a Man of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I knew Nature not partial to Birth; therefore fancy'd Under&s;tanding, like Beauty, might be found among the meane&s;t; and began my Enquiry among the Shepherds, and Labourers;&mdash;but found them as rea&s;onle&s;s, as the Cattle they tended. They po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a low Cun|ning, which an&s;wer'd all their Ends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Junior.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poets indeed amu&s;e us, Sir, with fine Stories about pa&s;torial Simplicity,&mdash; Innocence might go to Market in <HI>Ar|cadia;</HI> but in <HI>England</HI>'s Country Towns, Vice and Folly are as well receiv'd, as in any Pari&s;h within the Bills of Morta|lity; except that of playing at Cards on a <HI>Sunday.</HI> Tho' the&s;e Country People jump, run, ring, wre&s;tle, and play at Foot-ball on the Eve of the &s;ame Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saltern.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I vi&s;ited their Ma&s;ters;&mdash;but I was &s;till at Fault.&mdash;Market-day Meet|ings rubb'd off a little of their Ru&s;ti|cities;
<PB N="46" REF="47">yet they were not thoroughly humaniz'd:&mdash;One Day every Week they were drunk; once in &s;even Years, Mad; and every Year at Law. From them I took a Turn to the Country Squires; but they are only Farmers with fine Cloaths on.</P>
</SP>
<P>All the Di&s;tinction I cou'd make be|tween them, was, the Man of 100 l.<HI>per Ann.</HI> cou'd kill Game, and they who paid him his Rent were per&s;ecuted, if they kept a Gun in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I then paid my Re&s;pects to the Coun|try Gentlemen. Cou'd I have been &s;a|tisfied among the la&s;t, I might have hung up my Shield;&mdash;but I wanted &s;omething more,&mdash;like a nice Lady of my Acquaintance; who re&s;olv'd never to marry, till &s;he cou'd meet a Man without a Fault; liv'd &s;ingle till 56, and then run away with her Brother's hump|back'd Po&s;tillion,</P>
<P>In the Winter, I came up to <HI>London,</HI> and took Lodgings in <HI>Pall-mall.</HI> And as my Search had hitherto been confin'd to my own Sex, I re&s;olv'd now to dedi|cate &s;ome Time to the Ladies, &s;ince I found my&s;elf in the Neighbourhood of &s;o many beautiful A&s;&s;emblages. Scarcely had I form'd a proper Acquaintance among them, before it almo&s;t determin'd
<PB N="47" REF="48">me to give over my Pur&s;uit after a Man of Sen&s;e, and fix on one of the many amiable Women I had convers'd with, as a Partner for Life;&mdash;but I was too irre&s;olute:&mdash;I &s;aw too many; and what was wor&s;e, &s;aw them too often. I was weaned from my Thoughts, when I be|held the mo&s;t elegant Figures, and the fine&s;t Under&s;tandings, &s;acrificed to the Irregularities of Fa&s;hion. I began to think my Uncle right; and cou'd not help confe&s;&s;ing; that altho' Women, and Wi&s;dom, are the worthie&s;t Objects of our Admirations; yet too much. Speculation is ever attended with In|felicity.</P>
<P>I paid my Attendance to the Men in Power. But as the Ladies gave up their Merits to the Mode,&mdash;Jealou&s;y jaun|dic'd the fair Face of the great Men's Perfections.</P>
<P>I remov'd into the City, and directed my Inque&s;t among the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Here I met many prai&s;e-worthy Acquain|tance. The mo&s;t of tho&s;e I convers'd with, I found to be &s;en&s;ible, knowing and &s;ociable:&mdash;Yet few, very few, valued them&s;elves upon what they were really excellent in; or cou'd be quiet while they were happy. Some I &s;ay, who af|ter accumulating large E&s;tates, by in|credible
<PB N="48" REF="49">Indu&s;try, or as incredible good Fortune, were infected by the Epidemic of Ta&s;te, and commenc'd Connoi&s;&s;eurs: Others far gone in a Fondne&s;s for Qua|lity, either to be allied, or even ac|quainted with Nobility, wou'd lavi&s;h all their former Gettings: A third Sort, who had from among Dangers, Hard&s;hips, and Hazards, gather'd a happy Inde|pendance, &s;tung by the Venom of Par|ty wou'd &s;quander it all to purcha&s;e a Seat in Parliament, altho' there they never &s;poke, nor were ever properly &s;poke to.</P>
<P>Re&s;olving not to give over my Search, I a&s;&s;ociated with the Men of Repartee; but their Inattention to &s;ocial Duties &s;hock'd me: They are &s;uch Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in Rallery, that, like <HI>Ben</HI> the Sailor, they mu&s;t have their Joke thof the Ship was &s;inking. Friends, as well as Foes, are &s;ure to &s;uffer if they come within the way of their Wit; like the drunken Prize|fighter, who cut and &s;la&s;h'd every one round him, to &s;how People how finely he cou'd flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>Still re&s;olute in my Inquiry, I deter|min'd to follow Nature, tho' &s;he was earth'd in a Night-cellar. I was intro|duc'd among the Choice Spirits, as they call them&s;elves:&mdash;Their Spirits were
<PB N="49" REF="50">choice indeed:&mdash;They live the Life of tho&s;e In&s;ects, who are bred, brought to Maturity, and die within 24 Hours. For all that the&s;e &s;ing-&s;ong, &s;tory telling, mimic Exi&s;tences pretend to, is but to eat, drink, and divert for the Day. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity their ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, a Tavern. Teat their <HI>&s;ummum bonum.</HI></P>
<P>Yet among the&s;e, &s;ometimes you meet with the Glimmerings of Merit, tho' &s;od|den'd by the Dregs of Debauch.</P>
<P>But it often thus happens, that even real Genius &s;hall &s;o far deba&s;e it&s;elf, as to pro&s;titute the Bounties of Nature like &s;upperle&s;s Street-walkers, to a Set of People, who&s;e only Qualifications are, they can pay the Reckoning.</P>
<P>After laughing at the&s;e, and the re&s;t of Mankind, I began to look back on my pa&s;t Adventures, by way of Recri|mination; but I was not then &s;o much pleas'd as I expected to be; I found I had been a Bubble to my own Self-&s;ufficiency; that I had &s;et out to &s;eek an Impo&s;&s;ibility, &mdash;expecting to meet with a Man who &s;hou'd exceed me in Under&s;tanding; and yet as I was to be Judge, my own Vanity wou'd always prevent me from giving a true Verdict. Upon Reflection, I found I had only taken Man in the Gro&s;s; that they had all a Sufficiency of
<PB N="50" REF="51">Under&s;tanding, to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es they were intended for; that I was not half the Man of Sen&s;e I imagin'd my|&s;elf to be; and that, from a &s;uperficial Knowledge of the World, I had de&s;pis'd &s;everal Per&s;ons who had a greater Right to hold me in Contempt.</P>
<P>To-morrow, Mr. <HI>Junior,</HI> I &s;et out for an E&s;tate I have in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and if you are di&s;engag'd, and will wa&s;te a Month with me, a hearty Welcome &s;hall &s;upply the Place of much Ceremony. In <HI>Wales,</HI> Sir, you'll meet with Per&s;ons, I dare &s;ay, worth your Acquaintance. For altho' they are not as much pa|troniz'd as the People of neighbouring Principalities, (and their Mountains in|deed produce not <HI>Peruvian</HI> Trea&s;ure) yet the hardy Inhabitants inherit Virtues, that wou'd lend a Lu&s;tre to the be&s;t Birth|day Dre&s;s, at the mo&s;t brilliant Court in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> accepted the Invitation, pro|po&s;ing to him&s;elf many Opportunities for private Play, which he knew how to make beneficial. But on the &s;econd Af|ternoon of their Travelling, Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI>'s Hor&s;e threw him, which oblig'd them to lay by for a Day or two.</P>

<P><HI>Junior,</HI> tho' not &s;trictly a Man of Ho|nour, now and then had Touches of tho&s;e &s;ubordinate Virtues, Genero&s;ity and Compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He therefore deter|min'd to relieve her, &s;ent off the Beadle, and went with her him&s;elf to a mother|ly Woman's Hou&s;e, called <HI>Goody Wen,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="57">to whom he was recommended by the Neighbours.</P>
<P>The Report of this Piece of Humani|ty reach'd the Inn before <HI>Junior</HI>'s Re|turn. Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI> congratulated him upon it, and on the Conque&s;t he had made; for, continued he, I am certain, by the manner in which my Landlady related it to me, &s;he's fond of you. Wo|men are more forward to admire or re|ward Actions of Genero&s;ity than our Sex: She is of a very &s;anguine Complexion, and you &s;ee what a Wretch &s;he has for a Hu&s;band; for want of &s;omething bet|ter to do I made her Maid tell me her whole Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>She was bred up in that old Hall we were admiring when my Hor&s;e threw me. The Hou&s;e-keeper's Daughter, but at &s;eventeen, having added one to the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam,</HI> without a&s;king Leave legally for it, &s;he was di&s;charg'd. Our Landlord was Butler; he marry'd her, and the Squire bought this Hou&s;e for them. She's now but twenty-four, and if I am not extravagant in my Gue&s;|&s;es, <HI>Junior,</HI> &s;he's your own. She has been &s;o full of your Prai&s;es, it mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;at lea&s;t I beg you'll try, if it be on|ly to &s;atisfy me, how far I am right as to reading of Woman-kind.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">When <HI>Junior</HI> came down, he found in the fore Parlor his Landlady, with &s;everal Town's Folks.</P>
<P>As he enter'd, &s;he ro&s;e up &s;miling; and in a pretty li&s;ping manner addre&s;s'd him, with&mdash;dear Sir, well to be &s;ure you'll go to Heaven, I wi&s;h all Gentle|men were like you.&mdash;Lord, Sir, to have &s;o much Charity upon &s;uch a forlorn Creature.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Sir, you are one of the be&s;t Gentlemen that ever liv'd, and yet to &s;ee &s;ome Folks&mdash;that Gentleman came to know the Truth of it; for you was told, wa'ant you, Doctor, that the Beggar woman was the Gentleman's Wife, and how he had left her, and plunder'd her of all &s;he had, and &s;o &s;he lighted on him by Chance, and &s;o he gave her &s;ome Gold for Hu&s;h-money.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Opifer</HI> reply'd, he had heard &s;o, but the Story was not properly dige&s;ted; for as the animal Spirits are more heat|ed in the &s;ecretory Ve&s;&s;els of &s;ome Peo|ple, than of others, they &s;ee Things in different or adver&s;e Mediums. Now, Sir (turning to <HI>Junior</HI>) I am always neu|tral in my Judgment, until I have ana|lytically con&s;ider'd the Ingredients of every Report. For it is an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Po&s;tulalum with me; and not only with
<PB N="58" REF="59">me, but with mo&s;t of the great Men of Antiquity, never to believe any thing till we can be a&s;&s;ur'd of its Credibility; as <HI>Hypocrates</HI> ob&s;erves, in his forty-ninth Aphori&s;m.</P>
<P>Another of the Company (who&s;e Ink|horn dangling from his Button-hole, de|noted his Profe&s;&s;ion) rapping his Knuc|kles hard again&s;t the Table; call'd out &mdash;now God forgive my Sins, if I didn't hear that this Gentleman, begging his Pardon&mdash;but that the Woman did pick his Pockets to be &s;ure,&mdash;Yes, indeed, of his Watch, and &s;o he did &s;eize her coming to Town.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI> the Attorney declared, he had the Ca&s;e &s;tated three or four diffe|rent Ways to him; and with Submi&s;&s;ion, he cou'd not tell what to decree in it.&mdash; To be &s;ure Charity was not again&s;t the Statutes; but then to give away &s;uch a Sum a five Guineas, merely out of Compa&s;&s;ion! He mu&s;t demur to that; it was contrary to all Law or Equity. But however, Sir, your Health.&mdash;I have been in <HI>London</HI> my&s;elf, and have had all the fine Girls there; ha Land|lord, you have heard me &s;ay &s;o before; and they have all their Ups and Downs, and &s;o I re&s;t my Plea upon that.&mdash;The Gentleman has &s;een her before, or el&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="60">he looks to be a Gentleman of too much Sen&s;e, to throw away &s;uch a Sum as five Guineas to encourage Beggars, not|with&s;tanding &s;o many Laws to the con|trary.</P>
<P>As when all ermin'd and embo&s;s'd, glittering with foil Stones and &s;pun Gla&s;s, in Sultana State, the high Salary Ac|tre&s;s is &s;eated in the green Room, &s;hou'd &s;ome inferior allowanced Lady dare to thwart her High Mightine&s;s, with even a Hint about Equality of Merit, &s;udden her Imperialne&s;s wou'd ari&s;e, and darting the Scowl-Theatric at the Pattin-wear|ing Rival, maje&s;tically more out of the Room, like <HI>Dido</HI>'s Gho&s;t, &s;ilent and &s;ullen.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Junior</HI> gave the Lawyer the Look contemptuous; and de&s;iring the Landlady to bring him a Bowl of Rack up Stairs, order'd the Waiter to &s;how him into his own Room.</P>
<P>After he had &s;lapp'd to the Door, the Company &s;at &s;taring at one another, like a Parcel of imperfect Actors. At la&s;t the Landlady declared, &s;he was &s;ure and &s;orry that the Gentleman was &s;o affronted; and how do we know, but he may be &s;ome Nobleman in Di&s;gui&s;e, of &s;ome great Man, perhaps, belonging to the Government.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">As &s;ure as Saint <HI>Winifred,</HI> and &s;o he is (reply'd the Squire of the Square-root) and one of our <HI>Mary</HI>'s Relations.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Illicit,</HI> with a Sneer, enquired if <HI>Mary</HI>'s Relations were all great People?</P>
<P>Yes, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing and good Grace, they are all &s;o; ay, and have all Coats of Arms too, as well as my Family.</P>
<P>Unluckily the Lawyer interrupted him; by ob&s;erving, that &s;ome People pretended to Coats of Arms, yet wanted Arms to their Coats. Fle&s;h and Blood cou'd not bear this; he flung his Fi&s;t full upon Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI>'s Face; the a&s;toni&s;h'd Lawyer &s;tarted up like a Cock that's chained; and darting his Arms out &s;trait, by way of keeping off Blows, he entangled his Fingers in Mr. <HI>Aprice</HI>'s Hair: <HI>Aprice</HI> ru&s;hing forward drove Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI> into a Corner; and there the Exci&s;eman's Head, like a battering Ram, butted and rebut|ted again&s;t the Lawyer's Chin. The Welchman &s;pringing upon his Toes at every &s;troke, Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI>'s Teeth gna&s;h'd lamentably, and the hinder Part of his Skull &s;triking again&s;t the Wain&s;cot, &s;ounded di&s;mal.</P>
<P>The Apothecary mounted him&s;elf by a Chair's Help on a Table, at the other End of the Room, with two Candles
<PB N="61" REF="62">in his Hands, to &s;ee, and &s;how them fair Play.&mdash;The Landlord &s;tole away, to call the Exci&s;eman's Wife; and the Landlady &s;tood &s;hrieking, cla&s;ping her Arms round a large <HI>China</HI> Bowl &s;he had &s;natch'd up.</P>
<P>In the Corner, where the Heat of Bat|tle roar'd, happen'd to be a Ve&s;&s;el, which for Delicacy-&s;ake is named a Look|ing-gla&s;s. Whether the Combatants over&s;et the Ve&s;&s;el, or the Ve&s;&s;el over|threw them, is yet undetermin'd. Cer|tain it is, they were all three rolling on the Floor together; but <HI>Aprice</HI> &s;oon got a&s;tride Mr. <HI>Illicit;</HI> forcibly his Blows fell upon the Lawyer; when Mrs. <HI>Aprice</HI> entering, came &s;uddenly behind her Hu&s;|band, &s;eiz'd his Arms, and obtain'd in an In&s;tant a Ce&s;&s;ation of Fi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who had all this while manfully maintain'd his Po&s;t, as Candle-bearer to the Combatants, now de&s;cend|ed, and proffer'd his Service to Mr. <HI>Illicit,</HI> chirurgically;&mdash;but the Lawyer &s;wore he wou'dn't join I&s;&s;ue with any of um;&mdash;but he wou'd have Revenge;&mdash; He'd let them &s;ee what it was to &s;trike a &s;worn Attorney, for all his Eyes were clo&s;ed at pre&s;ent. He was oblig'd to be led Home, wet, brui&s;ed, and blinded: The Landlady went out to obey Mr.
<PB N="62" REF="63"><HI>Junior</HI>'s Order; and the Gentleman of vulgar Fractions remain'd Ma&s;ter of the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tributer of Medicines then be|gan to ob&s;erve, how wrong-headed Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI> was, in not &s;uffering his Brui&s;es to be dre&s;s'd; hinting &s;omewhat about Inflammations, tumefy'd Fle&s;h, Fi&s;&s;ures, Fevers, and Phlebotomy.</P>
<P>Now it was &s;aid, that Mr. <HI>Opifer,</HI> and Madam <HI>Aprice,</HI> had been naught toge|ther; but that the Doctor was incon|&s;tant, having Hopes to meet with a more agreeable Patient in the Landlady. This Mrs. <HI>Aprice</HI> had great Su&s;picion of: She had long time kept her&s;elf to her&s;elf, but now was re&s;olv'd to give Vent to her Indignation.</P>
<P>Her Hu&s;band had, from what &s;ome|times his Neighbours &s;aid, great Jea|lou&s;ies about his Wife; and Mr. <HI>Opifer,</HI> and he al&s;o, was then determin'd to have it out. The Wife's Blood was up, the Hu&s;band's Blood was up, and after &s;ome Altercation, they &s;et Mr. <HI>Opi|fer</HI>'s Blood up.</P>
<P>He hit Madam in the Teeth with &s;ome Particulars, which no Man cou'd be &s;uppos'd to have known, but her Hu&s;|band.&mdash;She flew at him;&mdash;he fled from
<PB N="63" REF="64">her: She &s;eiz'd the Knots of his Tye Wig; he left it in her Hands, (as a Bird e&s;capes with the Lo&s;s of his Tail-feathers) and run out of the Room; the Hu&s;band and Wife after him; they overtook him in the Entry; the Exci&s;eman be|gan to beat him unmercifully;&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Aprice</HI> &s;econded every Blow of her Hu&s;|band's, by hitting the Wig in the Doc|tor's Face; who all the while was cry|ing out Murder, Murder, for God's Sake.

<P>Mr. <HI>Aprice,</HI> and his <HI>Mary,</HI> went Home Arm in Arm: She comforting her&s;elf, that tho' his be&s;t Neckcloth was tore, thank God her Hu&s;band had be|hav'd him&s;elf like a Gentleman.</P>

<P>Next Morning <HI>Junior</HI> went to vi&s;it the Per&s;on he had &s;o lately relieved. If in her Wretchedne&s;s he di&s;cover'd &s;he was hand&s;ome, now neatly habited he cou'd not help loudly affirming, upon Oath, &s;he was the mo&s;t &s;triking Figure he ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Fixing her Eyes upon the Floor, and fetching a deep Sigh, &s;he reply'd, ala&s;s, Sir, forgive my Abruptne&s;s; but if you'll conde&s;cend to hear my Story.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> bow'd, and &s;eating him&s;elf by her, thus &s;he began.</P>
<P>I hope Sir you'll excu&s;e me, if for the pre&s;ent I don't mention my Name. But few Years are pa&s;t &s;ince I was counted the Toa&s;t and great Heire&s;s of the County my Father repre&s;ented in Par|liament.
<PB N="66" REF="67">As you know, Sir, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for a young Woman of Fa&s;hion to compleat her Education, but under a <HI>French</HI> Governe&s;s. I had one, who &s;oon gain'd me to think her the mo&s;t polite, friendly, and &s;en&s;ible Creature living. She made me de&s;pi&s;e my own Country, and &s;etting all tho&s;e who came to pay their Addre&s;&s;es to me, in a contemptible Light; and every Time &s;he &s;tood by me at my Dre&s;&s;ing-table, lamented that &s;uch Beauty, as I was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, &s;hou'd be made a Sacrifice to &s;ome rude, coar&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Savage.</P>
<P>I &s;igh'd for <HI>France,</HI> began to fancy my&s;elf choak'd with the foggy Air of <HI>England;</HI> for as Madamoi&s;elle told me, if I was at <HI>Paris,</HI> it wou'd be a very ea&s;y Thing for me to make a Conque&s;t of one of the Princes of the Blood. You mu&s;t be certain my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lovers did not meet with much Encouragement. Nay, I di&s;banded them all but one, who&s;e Name was <HI>Soil;</HI> he wou'd take no De|nial. He had the greate&s;t E&s;tate in our Neighbourhood, and the Relations on each Side de&s;ired it to be a Match. There|fore they contriv'd it &s;o, that &s;ometimes I was forc'd to &s;uffer my&s;elf of &s;it with him. But you wou'd have &s;mil'd to have &s;een our Tete a Tete Parties; when|ever
<PB N="67" REF="68">he offer'd to &s;peak, I met his Eyes with a full Stare.&mdash;He &s;tammer'd and blu&s;h'd like a School-boy,&mdash;then I us'd to bur&s;t into a loud Laugh, and he'd hang down his Head, turn round his Dog's Collar, putting the Butt-end of his Whip into his Mouth, (as an Infant does its Coral) play'd the La&s;h of it again&s;t his Boots, at the &s;ame Time I was pinching my Apron, or twirling my Watch Key.</P>
<P>One Day indeed he ventur'd &s;o far to open his Mind, as to invite me to &s;ee him ride a Sweep&s;takes.&mdash;My reply was, I dete&s;ted Hor&s;e-racing.&mdash;He look'd as &s;imple as a Shepherd.&mdash;I told him, if I was ever again to be puni&s;hed with his Company, I de&s;ir'd he wou'd not bring any of his Brother Brutes with him;&mdash; not but I a&s;&s;ur'd him, (pointing to his Greyhound) I thought the Dog a much more &s;en&s;ible Animal than his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted up, look'd round the Room as if he had lo&s;t &s;omething, clapp'd his Cap on, &s;mack'd his Whip, whi&s;tled his Dog out, bounced the Door after him, and got on Hor&s;back, cur&s;ing him&s;elf if he ever open'd after me again.</P>
<P>However, re&s;olving not to be thrown out, as he &s;aid, by a Pu&s;s, he determin'd to demand me in Form, and of my&s;elf too: But preparing him&s;elf with rather
<PB N="68" REF="69">too many Bumpers, to deliver &s;o im|portant a Que&s;tion, he made his At|tack upon my Woman, in &s;o boi&s;terous a Manner, that I was forced to leave my Dre&s;&s;ing-room to re&s;cue her. This Story I related in all the Places I vi&s;ited, with &s;everal Embelli&s;hments, placing him in &s;o ridiculous a Light, that he was forc'd to leave the Country, vowing Revenge again&s;t me,&mdash;but that I thought &s;o tri|fling to take Notice of;&mdash;my Heart was &s;et upon <HI>France,</HI> and I &s;oon per&s;uaded my Mama to &s;pend the following Win|ter with me in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>One Day, when every Thing was got ready for the intended Tour, Mr. Re|corder's Daughter, a young Lady about my Age, came to tell me what a Won|der was come to Town.</P>
<P>A fine Gentleman, &s;he &s;aid, an out|landi&s;h one, his Servants had Feathers in their Hats, and him&s;elf was all over Gold Lace.</P>
<P>The Mention of a Foreigner alarm'd me; my Heart beat impatient to make &s;o important a Conque&s;t. The very Day of his Arrival was our Sub&s;cription A&s;&s;embly. He danc'd with me,&mdash;and I learn'd, from his own Mouth, he was a <HI>French</HI> Nobleman.&mdash;How inimitable I thought was every Thing he did; &s;o odd,
<PB N="69" REF="70">&s;o out of the way, &s;o polite, &s;o ea&s;y; all the young Ladies were charm'd with him, as much as I was; but I had the Satisfaction of triumphing over them all; for it was to me alone he paid his Addre&s;&s;es. He prais'd my Figure, my Dancing, my Under&s;tanding; I cou'd have heard him for ever. But when he waited on me Home, judge, Sir, what &s;uch a giddy-headed Girl as I mu&s;t feel, to &s;ee him kneel at my Feet, and hear him name the Dames of the fir&s;t Quality and Beauty in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;wear I was, in point of Per&s;on, &s;uperior to them all.</P>
<P>When he took his Leave, all in Rap|ture, I made my Governe&s;s &s;it with me for two Hours, talking about him,&mdash; while &s;he&mdash;begg'd me not to be too cre|dulous,&mdash;nor fix my Affections on a Stranger. 'Tis true, &s;he &s;aid, he had the Air of Nobility, yet he might be a Sharper for all that, and begg'd I wou'd not give him the lea&s;t Encou|ragement, till &s;he had enquired into the Truth of what he was.</P>
<P>I was charm'd with this fre&s;h A&s;&s;u|rance, of what I thought the mo&s;t &s;incere Friend&s;hip; but I reply'd, her Care was needle&s;s; I was certain by his Addre&s;s, he mu&s;t be a Man of Fa&s;hion.&mdash;That did not &s;ignify, &s;he an&s;wer'd, &s;everal
<PB N="70" REF="71">young Ladies had been ruin'd by For|tune-hunters, and it was her Duty to take Care of me, and &s;he wou'd go that Day and be convinc'd.</P>
<P>When return'd from her Enquiry, &s;he congratulated me on the Conque&s;t I had made, for &s;he knew my Lord's Gentle|man in <HI>Paris,</HI> and he a&s;&s;ured her, his Ma&s;ter was violently in Love with me.</P>
<P>That Afternoon my Lord drank Tea with me. I &s;hall not trouble you with our Court&s;hip; indeed there was not much: But, prompted by my Governe&s;s, I agreed to go off with him, which in four Days from our fir&s;t Acquaintance I did.</P>
<P>I had a pretty con&s;iderable Fortune independant. When we arrived at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> that I drew out of the Bank, put into my Hu&s;band's Hands, and the next Day &s;et forward for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, Sir, the Cata|&s;trophe of this Amour:&mdash;He plunder'd and left me; informing me by a Letter, that he was &s;ent down by Mr. <HI>Soil</HI> on pur|po&s;e to make his Addre&s;&s;es to me; and that after I had received his Vi&s;its, <HI>Soil</HI> wou'd come down and expo&s;e me, by di&s;covering my Gallant, that I had pre|ferr'd, to be only a Waiter at <HI>White</HI>'s.&mdash;But this Fellow, who was really a <HI>French|man,</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72">was too cunning for us both, and went off with my Governe&s;s; with whom I have &s;ince di&s;cover'd he had concert|ed the Plan, when &s;he went to enquire after him.</P>
<P>That In&s;tant the Beadle opening the Door, interrupted her Narration; &s;ay|ing, that his Wor&s;hip, Mu&s;ter chief Con&s;table, mu&s;t &s;peak with them both this Minute. <HI>Junior</HI> de&s;iring the Lady not to be unea&s;y, went with the Beadle; but called of Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI> by the Way, to inform him of the Headborough's Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Saltern,</HI> who happen'd to know the Magi&s;trate and his Family, begg'd <HI>Junior</HI> to pay a particular Regard to the chief Con&s;table's Si&s;ter.&mdash;She was always pre&s;ent at all Examinations, and took va&s;t State upon her.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> promis'd him he wou'd, and in&s;tantly went towards his Wor&s;hip's; yet he cou'd not help wondering what the Magi&s;trate wanted with him.&mdash;The Reader perhaps may have the &s;ame Cu|rio&s;ity:&mdash;We will &s;atisfy him,&mdash;but it mu&s;t be in the next Chapter.</P>

<PB N="73" REF="74">who kept a Night-cellar, they left off Bu&s;ine&s;s, being well to pa&s;s; and came down into the Country to &s;ettle near his Brother-in-law's: And being, as he declared, brought up at Court; which he took care to let every body know, when he fir&s;t came down in the Country, (tho' not what Character he acted) was look'd upon among his Neighbours, as a very extraordinary &s;ort of a Man, and invited to a great many rich People's Hou&s;es; for he cou'd tell all about St. <HI>James</HI>'s and the Royal Fa|mily; knew to an Hour how old my Lord Duke was; to the tenth of an Inch, how high my Lady <HI>Jane</HI>'s Shoes were; what colour'd Silk the Dutche&s;s's Chair was lined with; when &s;uch a Counte&s;s cut her Nails; what Snuff the Prince u&s;ed, and how the King's Shoemaker took Mea&s;ure of his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Oatly</HI> had not heard of the Fray, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee his Brother's Eyes black, his Face &s;well'd, and Lip with a Patch on't.&mdash;He began to won|der at &s;uch a Sight, and ob&s;erv'd &s;uch Things were never &s;uffer'd at Court.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Illicit.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye Brother, the&s;e Things &s;hall appear at Court, in a Court of Law too. I had like to have been murder'd by
<PB N="74" REF="75">that Ra&s;cal <HI>Aprice,</HI> and two or three more of them; but I'll do for that Exci&s;e Fellow I warrant him;&mdash;but that a'ant all. Here are two Sharpers come to Town, they put up at the Crown, one of um pretends to keep his Bed by a Fall, and t'other has pick'd up a Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and there's &s;ome Scheme in it.</P>

<P>Like enough, like enough, I've met with &s;uch Things at Court very often.</P>

<P>Now you mu&s;t know, Brother, I'd have you &s;end for this Fellow and exa|mine him, and the Woman too; for he gave her five Guineas Ye&s;terday, and this is a Ca&s;e requires explaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oatley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, this is extraordinary; for when I was at Court, we us'd to ob&s;erve where Money was given, there was always &s;ome My&s;tery.&mdash;Therefore the Chief di&s;patch'd his Beadle for <HI>Junior</HI> imme|diately.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the Me&s;&s;enger went out, Ma|dam <HI>Illicit</HI> enter'd; and the Moment &s;he &s;aw her Brother, and Hu&s;band, &s;he points to her Spou&s;e's Face; crying out, here's a pretty Figure for you;&mdash;this is keep|ing Company with Strumpets,&mdash;yes, Bro|ther, my Hu&s;band is now always at the
<PB N="75" REF="76"><HI>Crown</HI> with that brazen-face Landlady, and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of her Bullies beat him.</P>
<P>The Hu&s;band call'd for Silence, the Brother call'd for Silence, but neither his Wor&s;hip's Authority, nor the Autho|rity of Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI> were equal in Power to her Voice; &s;he &s;tamp'd, &s;he roar'd, &s;he &s;colded:&mdash;They &s;tood &s;taring mo|tionle&s;s; as if unawares they had glanc'd on <HI>Medu&s;a</HI>'s Head; till her Breath, Voice, and Spirits being exhau&s;ted, &s;he &s;unk like an expiring Heroine, mute into a Chair.</P>

<P>By all Means, Sir, but give me Leave, Sir, fir&s;t to plead my Excu&s;e, in not pay|ing a proper Re&s;pect to that Lady, who I am certain I have had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; for there is an Air in&s;eparable to true Quality, which Coun|try Ladies may endeavour to imitate, but never can come up to.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Illicit,</HI> bridling up her Head, gave him a &s;low low Curte&s;y, wink'd upon her Brother, turn'd up her No&s;e at her Hu&s;band, and with contracted Mouth, li&s;p'd out, &s;he was &s;orry her Brother &s;hou'd &s;end for &s;o polite a Gentleman, &s;o <HI>Mellopropo.</HI>&mdash;To be &s;ure the Town Air was to be ob&s;erv'd with half an Eye, both in Ladies and Gentlemen; except it was by &s;ome People, who had (a Look at Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI>) no Ta&s;te, and could pre|fer low-lif't Inn-keepers Wives, to Per|&s;ons who had &s;uck'd in the Court Air with their Milk.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Illicit,</HI> who &s;at chewing the Cud of Re&s;entment, told his Brother;&mdash;you know you have a Right of Examination; I &s;ay, and in&s;i&s;t on't, that not only this Per&s;on be a&s;k'd to give an Account of him&s;elf, but&mdash;</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Illicit</HI> was leaning over the Back of his Wor&s;hip's Chair, to read the Note, when Mr. <HI>Oatley</HI> ri&s;ing ha&s;ty, his Head met her Forehead; it whi&s;k'd her round, and down &s;he &s;unk. This the Chief never minded, but kept bowing and complimenting <HI>Junior,</HI> de&s;iring him to take the arm'd Chair.&mdash;The Attor|ney &s;tar'd like a Man ju&s;t gorg'd with a large Bumper:&mdash;His Brother turning about, told him he was &s;orry to &s;ay it, but he was a very impertinent Fellow&mdash;for all you're my Brother;&mdash;and I hope, my Lord,&mdash;you are a very impudent Dog, Sirrah.&mdash;I a&s;k ten thou&s;and Par|dons, my Lord.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI>'s Spou&s;e, who had by this Time recover'd her Sen|&s;es from the Blow, and was ri&s;ing up to reak her Revenge;&mdash;but hearing the Word Lord mention'd,&mdash;&s;he &s;mooth'd her Cap,&mdash;&s;hook her Petticoats,&mdash;and &s;ideling round, &s;impering; &s;he a&s;k'd his Lord&s;hip's Pardon for her Hu&s;band's Ill-mannerdne&s;s; and hoped his Honour wou'd accept of Mr. <HI>Illicit</HI>'s a&s;king his Honour's Pardon.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>THE Head and the Heart are di|&s;tinct Organs: A Writer therefore, in his Addre&s;s to each, &s;hou'd vary his Manner and Matter. But as the Editor acknowledges him&s;elf but indifferently provided with Head, he begs Leave to continue this Hi&s;tory in the &s;ame Stile it began, and hopes the Reader will accept of an unbelli&s;h'd Relation of what befel the Lady after <HI>Junior</HI>'s De|parture.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Moments &s;he &s;at &s;ilent, her Hands cro&s;s'd upon her Knees, lo&s;t in Thought.&mdash;A loud wrap at the Door rouz'd her; in bur&s;t a Shoal of Ladies,
<PB N="80" REF="81">rural-bred,&mdash;no Apology,&mdash;for, in the Country, Familiarity is the Grammar of good Manners.</P>
<P>They had all the Morning flirted from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and Snow-ball like, gathered as they went forwards,&mdash;all agog to hear, what the two Gentlemen were; who the Woman was; and who father'd the Child.</P>
<P>After they had collected the whole Troop of Female-inqui&s;itors; it was, <HI>nem con,</HI> agreed to pay Goody <HI>Wen</HI> a Vi&s;it, and a&s;k her new Lodger &s;everal Que|&s;tions. They enter'd crowding, gig|gling, &s;taring, and curt&s;ying, all &s;peak|ing together.&mdash;I hope no <HI>London</HI> ac|compli&s;h'd Lady will be offended at my Suppo&s;ition, that the Female Folks of Country Hamlets may be a little in Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I have heard it a&s;&s;erted (how true it is I know not) but that in &s;ome Coun|try Towns, there are broad Starers, loud Talkers, &s;candal Spreaders, deep In|triguers, keen Game&s;ters, hu&s;band Ha|ters, religion Scoffers, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed ye true town-bred Toa&s;ts, as ye have not a Patent for your &s;everal high Qualifications,&mdash;why &s;hou'd you wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s them?&mdash;Ye do not,&mdash;they
<PB N="81" REF="82">have found their Way into the Country, as well as flounc'd Petticoats.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they had addre&s;s'd the &s;trange Lady, <HI>Junior</HI> return'd, and put an End to the &s;crutini&s;ing Party. They look'd a little &s;illy, or &s;o; begg'd Pardon, made &s;everal &s;hort Curt&s;ies, like <HI>May-day</HI> Milk-maids, huddled to the Door, each &s;triving to be fir&s;t out, as if the Hou&s;e was on Fire, and tittering, whi&s;pering, pu&s;hing, pinching, and &s;hrieking, run into the Street, like School-boy's in breaking-up Time, leaving the Lady to continue her Relation uninterrupted.</P>
<P><HI>Continuation of the Lady's Story.</HI></P>
<P>At a Place call'd <HI>Chantilly,</HI> was I left without a &s;econd Nece&s;&s;ary, and but a &s;ingle Guinea in the whole World. I acquainted the Landlady with my Misfortunes; &s;he endeavoured to com|fort me, and the next Morning came to let me know, that there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman who de&s;ir'd to be introduc'd to me.</P>
<P>How did I rejoice to hear there was any of my own Country there; I who had &s;o lately de&s;pi&s;ed every Per&s;on in it. So true it is, what in Pro&s;perity we mo&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="83">&s;light, in Adver&s;ity we fir&s;t fly to for Succour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;ufficiently recover'd my&s;elf, the Gentleman waited upon me; offer'd me his Sword, his Fortune to make me ea&s;y;&mdash;let me know he was a Man of Fa&s;hion, and begg'd Leave he might have the Honour of conducting me to <HI>England,</HI> or where el&s;e I thought fit.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething I thought &s;o no|ble in his Manner, I accepted of his Offers, and he attended me to <HI>Dover.</HI> From thence I wrote to an elderly Lady, an Aunt, the only Friend I cou'd de|pend upon.&mdash;For &s;he had in her Youth &s;uffered for her Fondne&s;s for your Sex, and was therefore mo&s;t likely to pity my Indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Being oblig'd to wait for an An&s;wer, the Gentleman who came over with me begg'd Leave to vi&s;it me while I &s;taid there.&mdash;I cou'd not refu&s;e him; his Be|haviour was mo&s;t re&s;pectful, his Con|ver&s;ation very engaging, his Actions &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, and his Expre&s;&s;ions &s;o very tender, I e&s;teem'd him.&mdash;Ah, when once a Lady thinks highly of any of any of your Sex, it is the Gallant's Fault if he does not receive the la&s;t Proof of it.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was my Ca&s;e.&mdash;Out of Gra|titude I confe&s;s'd to him, he was not
<PB N="83" REF="84">indifferent to me, but he wanted imme|diately rudely to avail him&s;elf by that Ac|knowledgment.&mdash;Thus Mankind behave generally to eager, or too in&s;en&s;ible; &s;el|dom knowing how to make a proper U&s;e of our Conce&s;&s;ions. What I in|tended as a Pre&s;ent to his Di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, he wanted to command by an Act of Power&mdash;he was deceived&mdash;he lo&s;t me by the Scheme that he laid to po&s;&s;e&s;s me.</P>
<P>I e&s;caped&mdash;refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, and the next Day he arre&s;ted me for Money laid, out for my U&s;e. An An&s;wer to the Letter which I had &s;ent arrived that ve|ry Day, and &s;ea&s;onably relieved me; unexpectedly for my Creditor I paid his Demands, and &s;et off, without &s;eeing him, for my Relations.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Veltry</HI> was one of tho&s;e very good Ladies, who dedicate mo&s;t Part of their Time to the making up and ad|mini&s;tring Medicines to the Poor; and I had not any better Amu&s;ement, than, like a Pupil at the Ho&s;pitals, to attend upon her.</P>
<P>This I &s;oon grew fatigued with&mdash;then I u&s;ed to weary my&s;elf with &s;auntering backwards and forwards under a long Elm-walk Rookery. Vi&s;iters we had none, and as to Books, all that her La|dy&s;hip would allow in her Library, treat|ed
<PB N="84" REF="85">upon Drugs and Di&s;ea&s;es, and the &s;e|veral Symptoms of each Di&s;temper; yet even the&s;e, for Want of Employment, I began to read over; but the Effects they had on me were terrible, not a Di&s;|ea&s;e they mentioned, but what I &s;oon fancied I was attacked with.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Volume I turned over was a Treati&s;e upon Cancers, and the very next Day I happened to have a Pain in my Brea&s;t, which alarmed me; a Di&s;cour&s;e upon Con&s;umptions cured me of my Concer; but then I dreaded an Ulcer upon my Lungs, tho&s;e Progno&s;tics were removed by an Account of the Gravel, which made me expect a Fit of the Stone. A Volume of drop&s;ical Ca&s;es fell next into my Hands, they di&s;&s;olved the Stone indeed, but fixed me in a very watry State&mdash;but a Book concerning the Eyes re&s;tored me to Health, tho' it gave me great Rea&s;ons to fear a <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI></P>
<P>I was obliged to leave off reading, for Fear of its being prejudicial to my Sight; and ju&s;t then Lady <HI>Veltry</HI>'s only Son ar|rived from <HI>Italy.</HI> As &s;oon as I &s;aw him, I felt an Unea&s;ine&s;s I could not account for; at fir&s;t I only imagined it to be a Compa&s;&s;ion for his Youth.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">He had a Delicacy of Figure, that I am certain would prejudice any of my Sex that &s;aw him in his Favour. I often pitied him in &s;ecret, to think what Dan|gers from the Debaucheries of <HI>London,</HI> a Gentleman of his Rank, Fortune and Spirits was expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon was alarmed at my own Condition. Involuntary Sighs, &s;udden Flu&s;hings, Palpitations of the Heart, unaccountable Anxiety and Tremors; Days wa&s;ted without breaking my Fa&s;t, and Nights without Sleep; the Symp|toms frightened me. I flew to my Phy|&s;ic Books, but could not find my Ca&s;e in any one Author.</P>
<P>A Self Examination proved I was in Love; I thought I had been &s;o with that <HI>French</HI> Impo&s;tor, but found now that was only Price. I had never before &s;uffered tho&s;e tender Sen&s;ations, tho&s;e Uproars I then every Day experienced. I delighted in the Di&s;covery, and in|dulged my Di&s;temper; con&s;ulted my Gla&s;s, and was a&s;&s;ured by that Oracle I &s;hould &s;ucceed; but I lo&s;t my Time; I de&s;pi&s;ed both him and my&s;elf; him for his In&s;en&s;ibility, me for my Want of Power.</P>
<P>A few Days after his Arrival, as we were &s;itting at Breakfa&s;t, the Conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="86" REF="87">happened to turn upon Love and Beauty. He very carele&s;sly declared, he looked upon Love, only as a poetical Rattle, invented to amu&s;e over-grown Boys and Girls with; and, as to beauti|ful Women, they were like <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> China, pretty Pieces of ornamental Fur|niture. I was choaked, could &s;carcely keep my Seat; but Lady <HI>Veltry,</HI> not be|ing &s;o immediately concerned in the Re|flection as I was, had Power to go on; de&s;iring him to be explicit concerning Matrimony; hoping, &s;he told him, to &s;ee him wed before &s;he died, to his and her Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He fixed his Eyes full on her Face, &s;hrugged up his Shoulders, &s;tarting from his Seat, and turning round with &s;uch a Smile, as &s;ome Ladies expre&s;s Hate by; he replied, dear Mem, you're va&s;tly good, and I'm immen&s;ely obliged to you. It is become quite the Thing, to be &s;ure, for Men of Fa&s;hion to be hum|med into one Piece of Folly or another. I am not to be out of Ta&s;te, I find; po&s;itively, my Lady, I doat upon your Advice. And, as I find marrying and keeping a Pack of Hounds are much practi&s;ed at pre&s;ent, I believe I may mortify my&s;elf &s;o far, as to build a Dog's Kennel&mdash;but, as to Matrimony&mdash;no&mdash;
<PB N="87" REF="88">I'll not come into the Buck-ba&s;ket. And turning upon his Heel left the Room, &s;inging Part of a Concerto.</P>
<P>We looked upon one another like two Travellers who had lo&s;t their Way; I began to entertain a mighty Contempt for his Under&s;tanding, yet I admired his Figure. I was certain he was a Fool, yet I could not help loving him. Men of many Words may reconcile this Pa|radox; all I can &s;ay, is, I felt it to be true.</P>
<P>When I retired to my Chamber, I found a thou&s;and Excu&s;es for his Beha|viour. I recollected an Intimacy, a ve|ry particular one, between this Gentle|man, and the Per&s;on who pa&s;s'd for his Valet; they dre&s;&s;ed much alike, they were not unlike in Figure. The Valet never &s;orted with the re&s;t of the Servants; and &s;everal Expre&s;&s;ions his Ma&s;ter made u&s;e of to him, made me conclude, that this Servant was &s;ome young Lady, whom he had &s;tole from a Nunnery.&mdash; I had often read of &s;uch Things, and that it was owing to this Connection, he &s;eemed &s;o aver&s;e to Marriage.</P>
<P>Lovers, Sir, altho' they may be mi&s;|taken in Point of Judgment, are gene|rally very quick-&s;ighted; at lea&s;t, &s;o we are apt to flatter our&s;elves. As &s;oon as
<PB N="88" REF="89">I had made this Di&s;covery, I enjoyed greatly my Penetration. I exulted on the Sagacity I fan&s;ied my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, I pitied the young Lady, wanted &s;adly to hear her Story, and re&s;olved gene|rou&s;ly to make a Sacrifice of my Pa&s;&s;ion to my Rival.</P>
<P>With this noble Di&s;po&s;ition I went to &s;leep&mdash;Pity, indeed, we cannot be &s;o di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, or irre&s;olute, as we wi&s;h to be. All my fine Flights of Di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s vani&s;hed in the Morning, and, as &s;oon as I &s;aw the Valet, I wi&s;hed the Creature out of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>That very Afternoon, as I was in my Dre&s;&s;ing-room, I heard in an adjoining Chamber Lady <HI>Veltry</HI>'s Son, and his Valet; a Divi&s;ion in the Wain&s;cot gave me an Opportunity of &s;eeing them with|out their di&s;covering it. I could not re&s;i&s;t the Temptation of looking thro' the Cre|vice; there I &s;aw them embrace each other with va&s;t Fondne&s;s, my Conjectures were then pa&s;t doubt; but, good God!&mdash; in a few Minutes after, excu&s;e me, Sir, (turning my Face away) I found the Wretches to be both of the &s;ame Sex. Shocked and trembling I hurried out of the Room, ru&s;hed down Stairs, and, at the Bottom, I fell into a fainting Fit. One of our Servants luckily cro&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="89" REF="90">Hall at that Moment, recovered me. Too dete&s;table is this Subject to dwell up|on. I told what I had &s;een, and the Pair of <HI>Catamites</HI> were &s;eized. When Lady <HI>Veltry</HI>'s Son came before her La|dy&s;hip &mdash;&s;o far from being daunted at the Di&s;covery, he gloried in it; pro|nounced it &s;uperb Ta&s;te; and pretended to vindicate him&s;elf, by va&s;t Fa&s;hion, and high Examples.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Veltry</HI> would not hear him pro|ceed; ordered him out of her Sight, took to her Bed immediately, and, in four Days Time, without ever &s;uffering her Son to come near her, died in my Arms.&mdash;But here the Lady was inter|rupted by the following Accident.</P>

<P>But, fir&s;t, &s;he &s;trictly enjoined her Brother to Secre&s;y concerning the whole Affair: Herein imitating &s;ome of the mighty Men, who make Laws&mdash;not for them&s;elves indeed, they act <HI>ad Libitum.</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="92">Thus this Lady, tho' &s;he po&s;itively in|&s;i&s;ted upon her Brother's not opening his Lips about it, yet &s;he could not help calling at three or four Neighbours Hou&s;es, to let them know what a Blun|derbu&s;s her Hu&s;band had been, and as how my Lord knew her the Moment &s;he came into the Room; and that &s;he was &s;ent for to drink Tea with his Lord&s;hip and the Lady; and that &s;he knew who the Lady was, and all about her&mdash;but, thank God, &s;he was no Blab, and how if it hadn't been for her knowing my Lord, my Lord would have ruined her Brother and her Hu&s;band, for affronting his Lord&s;hip; but, that my Lord was her intimate Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Madam <HI>Illicit</HI> came to Goo y <HI>Wen</HI>'s Door, where <HI>Junior</HI> was earne&s;tly attending to the fair Unfortunate's Nar|ration, &s;he met Mr. <HI>Seap,</HI> one of the Pari&s;h Officers, who was coming to pay the &s;trange Lady a Vi&s;it; but not out of an idle, unwarrantable, or impertinent Curio&s;ity; no, <HI>Junior</HI>'s Liberality had been mentioned all over the Town; and, according to ancient go&s;&s;ipping Cu&s;tom, was encrea&s;ed by arithmetical Progre&s;|&s;ion.&mdash;Therefore Mr. <HI>Seap,</HI> having the Good of his Pari&s;h at Heart, came to wait upon the Gentleman, to know concerning
<PB N="92" REF="93">the Woman and the Child; not that he imagined they would increa&s;e the Town's Poor-rates; but Accidents that might happen, ought to be provided a|gain&s;t; be&s;ides, as the Gentleman was known to be &s;o generous a Gentleman, it was doing his Duty to try, at lea&s;t, if by threatening the Wench about Secu|rity, he could not get <HI>Junior</HI> to make him a Pre&s;ent for the Benefit of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> ob&s;erves, doing Duty is duplex.</P>
<P>There is a Duty we owe our Neigh|bours, and a Duty we owe our&s;elves.</P>

<P>For, as every School-boy knows, the Temple of <HI>Janus</HI> was relative to War and Peace; <HI>Janus</HI> &s;hould certainly be blind-folded; to &s;hew, that War is &s;ometimes but a Game of Blindman's-buff; and in Peace-making, we &s;hould take Care not to be hood-wink'd.</P>

<P>I beg your Honour's Pardon, my Lord, and her Lady&s;hip's Honour's Pardon; but this Fellor was a coming to in&s;ult your Honour's, and your Lady&s;hip's Honour's Child&mdash;She was going on, im|patient to expre&s;s her&s;elf, curt&s;ying at every other Word, to &s;hew her Breeding, when poor <HI>Seap,</HI> in one of her Sinkings, &s;eized her by the Gown-tail, and cut &s;hort her Compliments, by pulling her bump upon his Brea&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>The Story of the Lady continued.</HI></P>
<P>I fear, Sir, my Tale is already grown tire&s;ome; the Remainder of it, I doubt, you will think more &s;o; &s;ince I &s;hall be obliged to mention &s;everal Facts, wherein the Vanity and Ingratitude of Mankind are con&s;picuous.&mdash;From what already I had known of your Sex, you mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e they could be much in my E&s;|teem; and what afterwards happened to me, corroborated the Contempt I en|tertained for them; and was, as I then thought, a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for the Manner in which afterwards they were treated by me. I wi&s;h what I have &s;uf|fered might deter others from too much indulging the &s;trong Sallies of their Imagination, and by my Example would remember, that they who attempt to make others ridiculous, always lay them&s;elves open to Revenge.</P>
<P>All that Lady <HI>Veltry</HI> could leave from her Son, &s;he gave me; and after her
<PB N="96" REF="97">Decea&s;e, in Money, Bills and Jewels, I found my&s;elf worth upwards of five thou&s;and Pounds. As &s;oon as the Fune|ral was over, I &s;at out for <HI>London.</HI> A Wheel of my Chai&s;e giving Way on the Road, I put up at Noon-time at an Inn, a &s;ingle Hou&s;e; upon the Bench before the Door, I &s;aw a very neat dre&s;&s;ed young Woman &s;it crying, her Arms had &s;ome black and blue Marks on them, and her Cap and Hat was in Di&s;|order. I enquired of the By-&s;tanders, what was the Rea&s;on of her Di&s;tre&s;s? They told me, her Hu&s;band had been beating her; and ju&s;t at the In&s;tant he came back, a black, ill-looking Fellow; I a&s;ked him, mildly, the Rea&s;on of his u&s;ing &s;o prettya young Creature &s;o barba|rou&s;ly? He replied, &s;urlily, &s;he was his Wife, and no Body had any Bu&s;ine&s;s with her, but him&s;elf. However, I at la&s;t, by giving him &s;ome Money, paci|fied him. I took &s;uch a Fancy to the young Woman, that I brought her to Town, and kept her with me. She had been educated by her Parents on Purpo&s;e to go into Place as an upper Servant; her Father was a Jailor, where this Fel|low of her's had been committed for &s;muggling, nay, outlaw'd; &s;he took-Pi|ty of him, helped him to make his
<PB N="97" REF="98">E&s;cape, and went off with him. They had been rambling about the Country for &s;ix Months; he was a Tinker, and &s;he was very ingenious; &s;he made and &s;old artificial Flowers at the Gentlemen and Farmers Hou&s;es about the Country. But in the la&s;t Town they came from, a very rich Man wanted to be rather too familiar with her; &s;he repul&s;ed him, but her Lover would not give it over, went to her Hu&s;band, and proffered him a Sum of Money to &s;ell his Wife.&mdash;The Fellow con&s;ented, and the Blows &s;he had received, were becau&s;e &s;he would not comply. This Relation I could not help entering in my Account Courant again&s;t your Sex; and yet I own, Sir, I wi&s;hed to meet with &s;ome Incidents, that would make me think better of Man|kind.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, a Man on Hor&s;e|back called to my Po&s;tillion to &s;top; but ju&s;t as he came up to the Chai&s;e, his Crape dropped from his Face, and I knew him to be one of Lady <HI>Veltry</HI>'s Servants, who had been di&s;charged about two Months before; I then thought there was &s;ome Inju&s;tice in his Di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion; and I remember, at his taking Leave of me, I put a Moidore in his Hand, and to his Gratitude I imputed
<PB N="98" REF="99">my not being robbed by him. The next Morning, my Servant came to tell me, that he was &s;ure he &s;aw the Highway|man in the Yard, that &s;topped the Chai&s;e Ye&s;terday, and a&s;ked my Leave to have him taken up. I was &s;hocked at the News, and ordered him on his Peril not to &s;ay a Word, but &s;ent my Woman with him down Stairs to find the poor Wretch out, and bid him get off&mdash; They did &s;o, and it gave me great Ea&s;e, when they told me of it; for I dreaded, if he was &s;eized, that I mu&s;t have taken an Oath in a Court of Ju&s;tice upon Life and Death &mdash; That Action, I knew, would &s;it heavy upon my Mind as long as I lived&mdash;to be acce&s;&s;ary in hanging any Per&s;on, even tho' they de&s;erved it, was what I could not reconcile to my|&s;elf. It may be looked on as a fooli&s;h Woman's Prejudice, but I can no more get over it, than &s;everal of your Sex can their Tremblings at Cats, Chee&s;e, and many other Antipathies.</P>
<P>That Evening, as I &s;at at Supper, I received a Letter directed to me. It &s;ur|prized me, how any Per&s;on could &s;end me a Letter as I was upon a Journey&mdash; but I could hardly fancy my&s;elf awake, or in my right Sen&s;es, when I found it
<PB N="99" REF="100">was from the Wretch, who, but that Morning, I cautioned to make his E&s;|cape&mdash;and that it was a Love-letter too&mdash;I read it over &s;o often, it is not ea&s;y for me to forget it. He began with hoping my Honour wasn't fright|ened when he came up to the Chai&s;e, for he wouldn't hurt a Hair of my Head for all the World; hoped I would par|don his Boldne&s;s in breaking his Mind to me. That, to be &s;ure, he never could have had the Boldne&s;s to think, that &s;o fine a Lady as I was, could have liked him &s;o very much; not but that his Fel|low Servants u&s;ed to &s;ay, when he lived at Lady <HI>Veltry</HI>'s, that young Madam (meaning me) took his Part very much&mdash; but, to be &s;ure, Madam&mdash;(thus the Wretch went on) when you put the Moi|dore in my Hand, as I was leaving my Place, I thought you gave my Hand a Squeeze, and you have run in my Head ever &s;ince; and when, Ye&s;terday, the young Woman told me, you advi&s;ed me to get off, I was pretty &s;ure you had ta|ken a Fancy to me; &s;o was re&s;olved to let you know it. Tho' I have wore a Livery, Gentlewomen put up with that; and, as to my taking the Road, what can a Man do, that has been u&s;ed to live well without Working? And there's
<PB N="100" REF="101">Cheating in all Trades, and every Body allows the Highway is as much a Gen|tleman's Profe&s;&s;ion, as playing at Cards.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, the An&s;wer I &s;ent him&mdash;I never &s;aw my Lover any more&mdash;but I kept his Letter, as a Ma&s;|ter-piece of human Vanity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived in <HI>London,</HI> I be|gan to put my intended Schemes in Ex|ecution, of making your Sex my Dupes; I did &s;o. I u&s;ed my Lovers as &s;ome Sport&s;men do Game; lure, hunt, and toil them: But&mdash;</P>
<P>The Waiter from the Inn came ju&s;t then, to let the Gentleman know, Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI> de&s;ired his Company to Dinner, which was taking up, and begged Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> would bring the Lady with him. <HI>Junior</HI> immediately went with the Waiter, the Lady promi&s;ed to follow after Dinner was over. During the Meal, <HI>Jack</HI> let his Friend into as much of the Lady's Hi&s;tory as he knew; and then went to Goody <HI>Wen</HI>'s to e&s;cort her to the Inn. As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI> &s;aw her, he could not help &s;aying, <HI>a Beauty, indeed!</HI>&mdash; Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> told the Lady, he had related to Mr. <HI>Saltern</HI> all the preceding Part of her Hi&s;tory&mdash;upon which, as there were only them three pre|&s;ent, &s;he thus concluded her Adventures.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">What a Multitude of ridiculous Ac|tions I did occa&s;ion &s;everal very wi&s;e Lo|vers to commit!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay this in Prai&s;e of Under|&s;tanding, Sapience, Knowledge, or what|ever other Title learned Folks know it by; that I found tho&s;e my greate&s;t Dupes, who imagined them&s;elves too mighty to be made Fools of. Your real Coxcombs, Dunces and Imperti|nents, I could do nothing with&mdash;Fow|lers might as well attempt to follow wild Gee&s;e by their Track. Yet let me do your Sex &s;o far Ju&s;tice; Ingratitude is not &s;olely confined to the Ma&s;culine Gender&mdash;for my Woman, who had been my Confident in all my Schemes, nay, my Agent in mo&s;t, whom I had re&s;cued from the Blows of that Outlaw&mdash;&s;he, Gentlemen, revenged your Sex.</P>
<P>For when I grew to be tired of mak|ing Mankind my May-game, &s;he advi&s;|ed me to Matrimony&mdash;I had often thought of it my&s;elf, and, upon her Recommendation, admitted a rich <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Merchant, ju&s;t arrived from <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> to pay his Addre&s;&s;es to me&mdash; Oh! Gentlemen, they who will deceive, ought to be deceived in their Turns. I was &s;o, and not to tire you with dull,
<PB N="102" REF="103">common-place Repetitions, I was a &s;e|cond Time trepanned.</P>
<P>Afterwards, but too late indeed, I found out the Villainy. My Woman had met in <HI>London</HI> her Fellow, whom I had re&s;cued her from, and he per&s;uad|ed her to be concerned in this Confede|racy again&s;t me. They dre&s;&s;ed up one of their Gang in a proper Habit, and introduced to me as a <HI>We&s;t Indian.</HI> Sure Villainy mu&s;t &s;everely &s;uffer in the next World, it meets with &s;o much Succe&s;s in this. We were married; and, on my Husband's prai&s;ing the I&s;land of <HI>Ja|maica</HI> to me, and the va&s;t Profits that were made there by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchan|dize, he per&s;uaded me to go with him, draw my Money out of the Stocks, and lay it out in Trade. We went over from <HI>Park-gate</HI> to <HI>Dublin,</HI> where one of his Ships lay, as he told me. Indeed he carried me on board a very hand&s;ome Ship, where I was treated with the ut|mo&s;t Civility, and lay in the great Ca|bin that Night. But, Gentlemen, think what my Surprize mu&s;t be in the Morn|ing, to find my&s;elf when I woke in the Arms of a Stranger. After much &s;trug|gling, I &s;prung from him, but I had no where to &s;helter my&s;elf; the Ship I found was under Sail, and I was &s;ent for a Slave
<PB N="103" REF="104">to the Plantations. The Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el, which was indeed a Ship that carried &s;uch unhappy Wretches over, told me, that I was repre&s;ented to him as a common Woman of the Town; that the Gentleman I came on board with, was to be married to a great For|tune, but I per&s;ecuted him &s;o, there was no Way of making two Families happy, but by contriving to get me out of the Way&mdash;I a&s;ked after my Trunks. He &s;hewed me a Che&s;t which was left for me&mdash;I had it broke open, and in&s;tead of Cloaths, it was filled with Straw, Sticks and Stones.</P>
<P>This, the Captain told me, opened his Eyes, and he believed that I was ill u&s;ed&mdash;but, as the Wind was fair, &s;hould he alter his Cour&s;e to &s;et me upon Shore, his Owners would ruin him; but he would take Care of me; he &s;wore, and begged Pardon for getting to Bed to me &mdash;but &s;ince what was done could not be undone, he &s;uppo&s;ed there was no Harm, he &s;aid, if I and he &s;towed in the &s;ame Birth together.</P>
<P>What could I do, Gentlemen, in the&s;e mo&s;t wretched Circum&s;tances? He ad|ded, that when I came to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> I &s;hould live like a Lady; that he would bring me &s;afe back again, and that if it

<PB N="104" REF="107">co&s;t him all he was worth in the World, he would find out the Villains who had wronged me.</P>
<P>For the Remainder of the Voyage we lived together; and when the Ship came into Harbour, he fulfilled his Promi&s;e of behaving to me like a Man.&mdash;He &s;old me for a three Years indented Ser|vant; having per&s;uaded me to &s;ign a Paper before he went a&s;hore, which he &s;aid was nece&s;&s;ary for both our Securities to his Owners.</P>
<P>You may wonder, perhaps, Mr. <HI>Ju|nior,</HI> how I had a Fortitude of Mind &s;ufficient to endure &s;uch Shocks as the&s;e were. Indeed, Gentlemen, I cannot boa&s;t of what your Sex calls Stoici&s;m &mdash;I don't know whether I am right in the Word, or no; but I mean that Phi|lo&s;ophic Armour of Indifference, in which the famous Men of former Times are &s;aid to have given Battle to the Pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Yet our Sex has a Shield that is our &s;ure Defence, when we plea&s;e to make U&s;e of it. It is Spirit&mdash;and a Lady's Spirit, like a King's Prerogative, is ab|&s;olute, we will do what we plea&s;e with it.</P>
<P>I was taken by a Widow Lady, a Tawny-moor, to be her Waiting-wo|man. I had an ea&s;y Place of it; only
<PB N="105" REF="108">now and then I was a little puzzled a|bout chu&s;ing Ribbands to &s;uit her Com|plexion&mdash;You &s;mile, Gentlemen, up|on my Honour it is true. Tho' her Face, Neck and Arms were exactly a Copper Colour, &s;he &s;pent three Hours every Day at her Dre&s;&s;ing-table; but the&s;e <HI>Mu|lattos</HI> are much more affected than <HI>Europeans;</HI> at lea&s;t, I fancy, if in <HI>Eng|land</HI> any ill-favoured Per&s;ons &s;hould take Pains to ornament their Faces, they would be &s;tared at as Prodigies of Va|nity, va&s;tly odd Creatures, and &s;uch as don't appear above once in a Century.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' very old, as well as intolerably ugly, was incredibly rich; &s;everal Per&s;ons, even of the be&s;t Fami|lies upon the I&s;land, paid their Addre&s;&s;es to her (in this too I hope we differ from them.)</P>
<P>One Afternoon, as I was &s;itting by my&s;elf in the Dining-room, a Gentle|man, who was the greate&s;t Favorite my Mi&s;tre&s;s had, came behind me &s;oftly, and before I was aware, throwing his Arms round my Neck, gave me three or four Ki&s;&s;es (the fir&s;t and the la&s;t Time he ever &s;erved me &s;o) the old Lady entered that Moment, and took immediately &s;uch an Antipathy to me, that &s;he was re&s;olved to have me poi&s;oned, tho&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="109">Things are often, and very ea&s;ily done there.</P>
<P>Had it not been for an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> one of the Over&s;eers of her Slaves, I had died a Victim to her Jealou&s;y. By his Means, tho' it was attended with in|numerable Difficulties, I made my E&s;|cape off the I&s;land. He took me with him to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> from whence we &s;ail|ed for <HI>England;</HI> but on the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Shore our Ship was lo&s;t; and tho' we &s;av'd &s;e|veral Things of Value out of the Wreck, the Country People came down, Wo|men as well as Men, and plundered us of them all.</P>
<P>I wonder tho&s;e Things are &s;uffered in &s;uch a Kingdom as <HI>England</HI> is. I am no Politician, but really believe our Legi|&s;lators know not that &s;uch Things are practis'd; or if they have heard of them, fan&s;y them to be &s;o much exaggerated, they are not worth attending to.</P>

<P>Yet I hope to be allow'd, ob&s;erving one Thing in Behalf of us Putters-together-of things, for the Amu&s;ement of the very indolent Part of the Public.</P>
<P>That altho' our Enemies &s;ay we have neither Morals, Learning, Money, nor Manners.&mdash;As to Morals, <HI>vide</HI> the fir&s;t Part of this Chapter; and our Learning is elaborately &s;hown, by our Quotations from the <HI>Greek</HI> Grammar; the <HI>appropos French</HI> Phra&s;es we have &s;e|lected from Dictionaire Royal; and the many cla&s;&s;ical Lines, which with much Trouble we have help'd our&s;elves to out of what is call'd <HI>Lilly</HI>'s <HI>Sintaxis.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; as to our Manners, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> has taken upon him to teach grown Gentlemen, to be &s;ure we are much more poli&s;h'd than before; we now and then receiving a genteel Le&s;&s;on for writing a proper Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>Indeed, as to Money, I have nothing to &s;ay to it, in this ungrateful, illiberal Age: We Geniu&s;&s;es are no more minded than worn-out Women of the Town; nay, not &s;o much, for they can turn Bawds, and keep the be&s;t Company;&mdash;
<PB N="110" REF="113">but who the Devil can we pimp for? The Mu&s;es are old Maids, and Prudes, and pa&s;t Child-bearing; and we're too &s;habby, and &s;hamefac'd, to &s;ay any thing to terre&s;tial Toa&s;ts.</P>
<P>What an unrewarding Aera this is? The World knows we have nothing to live by but our Wits, and they are re|&s;olv'd we &s;hall have nothing more &s;ub|&s;tantial to live upon. I remember, when a well-timed Pamphlet again&s;t either Party was Bread; and an Attack upon the Admini&s;tration a Suit of Clothes certain. But there's nothing read now-a-days, but &s;uch a General beats the <HI>French</HI> there, and &s;uch an Admiral takes the <HI>French</HI> here; and this and that I&s;land &s;urrenders to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> ju&s;t like the old Stories we heard at School, about the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> conquer|ing every body.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are &s;o common, and <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are &s;o uncharitable, that if we were to wa&s;te the la&s;t Drop of our Ink in the Cau&s;e of our Country; in what part of our Country &s;hou'd we be taken Care of, for it? Or tho' we wore our Pens to the Stumps in prai&s;e of roa&s;t Beef, we &s;hou'd never get a Belly-full by it.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="114">For my own Part, let Ignorance en|crea&s;e, I re&s;olve again&s;t publi&s;hing any more Things: I'll have my Bundle of Ma|nu&s;cripts buried with me, and &s;ay with <HI>Scipio,</HI> my ungrateful Country &s;hall have none of my Remains.</P>
<P>Yet benign Reader, as I have a very capacious Family, and there are &s;everal out&s;tanding chalk Accounts in the Neigh|bourhood again&s;t me, let me beg you'll give this Work a good Word; if it's only for the Sake of the old Maxim, &s;ince you have been taken in to buy it: Lend your Help to hum others; or you may prai&s;e it upon the &s;ame humane Prin|ciple, as &s;ome Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es will give Servants they Di&s;charge (for male Practices) a good Character.

<P>That you may have &s;omething to prai&s;e me for, plea&s;e Reader to ob&s;erve the elegant Quaintne&s;s of Stile, which is inter&s;per&s;ed up and down in &s;everal pe|culiar Phra&s;es thro' this Compilation.

<P>THE Lady's Story, with her man|ner of telling it, made &s;uch an Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon Mr. <HI>Saltern,</HI> he offer'd her him&s;elf and Fortune, &s;o genteely, &s;he mu&s;t have been guilty of the utmo&s;t Ill-manners, not to have accepted of at lea&s;t one of them.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> had left them to them&s;elves all that Evening, being entirely taken up
<PB N="113" REF="116">with pacifying the Landlady, Mrs. <HI>Belcy.</HI> Her Hu&s;band had &s;truck her that Day; an Action, which, as &s;he &s;aid, was horrid to think of, and what he never before had ever dared to attempt; but &s;he'd be reveng'd of him by all that was Good:&mdash; Vow'd never more to come between a Pair of Sheets with him, nor live longer in the &s;ame Hou&s;e: And letting <HI>Junior</HI> &s;ee &s;he had five hundred Pounds in Bank Bills and Ca&s;h, he con&s;ented to go off with her the fir&s;t Opportunity. For <HI>Jack</HI> knew by Experience, fine Women in the &s;porting Way, are better Tools than fal&s;e Dice; more Money is got with them, and without the Fear of Detection, which &s;ometimes cramps a fine-finger'd Fellow's Dexterity.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had <HI>Aurora,</HI>&mdash;no not &s;o &s;oon,&mdash;Day's Curtains had been &s;ome|time undrawn, and the ro&s;y-finger'd La|dy&s;hip had taken her Pinch of Snuff after Breakfa&s;t, before the two Gentlemen and Lady met at the Tea-table.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Saltern,</HI> after making a proper Apology, inform'd Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> he wou'd po&s;tpone his intended <HI>Welch</HI> Tour, un|til his Return from <HI>London;</HI> for which City he intended in&s;tantly to &s;et out, and with this Lady's Con&s;ent, &s;et her down &s;afe there; and a&s;&s;i&s;t her to make an
<PB N="114" REF="117">Appearance worthy her Family and Breeding; begg'd Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> wou'd meet him in Town; which <HI>Jack</HI> promis'd without He&s;itation.</P>
<P>When every Thing was concluded, off rattled the Po&s;t-chai&s;e, with Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Sal|tern</HI> and Company; and at the &s;ame In|&s;tant, into the Yard came limping a broken-knee'd Hackney, who&s;e Sides and Shoulders look'd like an ill-flea'd Bul|lock; upon his Back, &s;at &s;ideling, al|mo&s;t incru&s;tated with Dirt, a tall thin Fi|gure, meagre-fac'd, who&s;e white-paper'd Curls hanging down his bloodle&s;s Cheeks, made him yet look more gha&s;tly: He pitch'd his Voice in the proper Key of under&s;trapping Authority, and bawl'd about him, O&s;tler, Landlord, Cook, Drawer, and Tap&s;ter; ordering &s;ome burn'd Wine for him&s;elf, warm Stables for the Hor&s;es, and a Fire in the be&s;t Parlour for his Honour.</P>
<P>Away bur&s;t the Servants, hurrying here and there, like a Parcel of di&s;turb'd Ants; when on a &s;udden, they heard the Hor&s;es trampling in high Trot along the Street, and dextrou&s;ly turning under the Gateway, up the Yard prancing, ap|pear'd a nice harne&s;s'd Set of &s;leek-coated che&s;nut Geldings, rolling in their Rear a <HI>French</HI> varni&s;h'd Vis a Vis; out
<PB N="115" REF="118">of which nimbly &s;kipp'd Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty Fla&s;h,</HI> Lady Dowager <HI>Grotto</HI> follow'd him, cau|tiou&s;ly &s;tepping down between Land|lord, Landlady, three Chambermaids, two Drawers, and Tap&s;ter, regularly rang'd at the Door of the Carriage, as a Ship's Side is mann'd for the Entrance or Exit of a great Per&s;onage.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> was by his Profe&s;&s;ion Company for a Man of Fa&s;hion; and being inti|mate with the Baronet, no wonder they were rejoiced to &s;ee each other.&mdash;Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> had been down to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an E&s;tate, about fifty Miles farther to the We&s;t. The Baronet introduc'd <HI>Junior</HI> to Lady <HI>Grotto.</HI> Her Lady&s;hip receiv'd him with a Politene&s;s due to her Son's Recommendation; declaring &s;he &s;hou'd be proud to have the Plea&s;ure of cultivating an Acquaintance.&mdash;There was &s;omething in <HI>Junior</HI>'s Figure not di&s;plea&s;ing;&mdash;but of this more hereafter, &mdash;or perhaps not.&mdash;But we mu&s;t men|tion, Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> fell in Love at fir&s;t Sight with the Landlady,&mdash;cou'd talk of no|thing el&s;e all Dinner-time;&mdash; &s;moak'd the Rea&s;on of <HI>Junior</HI>'s being there;&mdash;de&s;ir'd <HI>Jack</HI> to take a Turn in the Garden with him; and the Baronet then told him, he'd give 500 if he had her in <HI>London.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Beginning of the&s;e Memoirs, or Collection of Paragraphs, the Editor promi&s;ed a Hi&s;tory of the hu|man Mind, but never declared whether it was to be a Male or Female one. If he intended to de&s;cribe a Lady's Incli|nations, he flattered him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>For where is the &s;cientific Page, that can lead us to unravel the whim&s;ical Workings of a fine Woman's Fancy?</P>
<P>Yet they them&s;elves can account for the greate&s;t &s;eeming Incon&s;i&s;tencies of their own Sex's Behaviour, as ea&s;ily as we form a cometary Sy&s;tem. Nay, I heard &s;everal of their Opinions upon Mrs. <HI>Belcy,</HI> the Landlady's Ca&s;e; who, tho' &s;he went away with Mr. <HI>Junior,</HI> as we may &s;uppo&s;e, for Love; yet, if &s;he did grant Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> a Favour, or &s;o, &s;he was not &s;o much to blame, as People might imagine her to be. This may, indeed (as the Lady &s;aid) &s;eem odd to &s;ome &s;trange Mortals, but they mu&s;t be exce&s;&s;ively ignorant, and &s;hockingly ab&s;urd in their Ideas, to fan&s;y a fine Wo|man could be con&s;tant. Be&s;ides, as Mi&s;s <HI>Juliet,</HI> the great Actre&s;s, ob&s;erved,
<PB N="120" REF="123">Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> was a Man of Con&s;equence, and perhaps rich as <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mines, and generous as Woman's warme&s;t Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mr. Deputy's Lady pre&s;umed, that <HI>Junior</HI> might grow cold, neglect her, and not give Madam <HI>Belcy</HI> &s;o much of his Time as he ought, and &s;he did it to be even with him: For as Revenge is &s;weet, this mu&s;t be a very &s;weet Re|venge&mdash;or perhaps (Mi&s;s in her Teens, &s;ighing, remarked) that Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> might take at fir&s;t &s;ome unbecoming Advan|tage, and hinted &s;omething about a Ma&s;|querade, that terrible <HI>Auto-de-&s;e</HI> to <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Cha&s;tities.</P>
<P><HI>Harry Hatzell,</HI> an Intimate of the Editor's, hit off the true Rea&s;on at once &mdash; &s;aying, the Landlady thought, that two Friends, like two Heads, would be better than one; that Emulation is Vi|gour's Whet&s;tone, and a Lady who has only one Lover, is as ill &s;erved as a Town with but one Tavern in it.</P>
<P>To this Opinion the Tran&s;criber &s;igns, for &s;he wanted as many Friends as &s;he could get, to &s;ecure her from her Hu&s;|band's Re&s;entment; who, pre&s;ently af|ter her Elopement, broke up Hou&s;e|keeping, adverti&s;ed her, and was on his Journey to <HI>London</HI> to &s;earch for her.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="124">The Baronet, tho' very vain, had not yet talked of his Mi&s;tre&s;s either at the <HI>Star, King's-Arms,</HI> or <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> whe|ther out of Regard to Mrs. <HI>Belcy,</HI> or Fear of her Hu&s;band, is undetermined. He had Subtlety enough to have every Thing tran&s;acted in <HI>Junior</HI>'s Name, and every Thing was perfectly ea&s;y with <HI>Jack,</HI> as if he had been her Hu&s;band. Indeed, he came Home but &s;eldom; he was eternally at my Lady Dowager's&mdash; he was her Lady&s;hip's Right-hand&mdash; And he al&s;o became equally nece&s;&s;ary to Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> who was but ju&s;t recovered out of a Fit of Sickne&s;s, which <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s Bani&s;hment had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>Every Day Lady <HI>Grotto</HI> was obliged to pay or return Vi&s;its, Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> &s;tayed at Home to divert Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> at Piquet; for, &s;ince her la&s;t Illne&s;s, Cards were ordered her, by way of Alterative.</P>
<P>Grief, as Mr. <HI>Vellum</HI> very &s;lowly ob|&s;erves, is two-fold; 'tis like Cinnabar, na|tural and factitious; and Sorrow is dry. Drink therefore is held by &s;ome, as a wonderful Panacea; in Catholic Coun|tries, a Cloi&s;ter is the Specific. Hang|ing, drowning, and &s;hooting are u&s;ed by the good People of <HI>England;</HI> but as they are only quack Experiments, not &s;laying
<PB N="122" REF="125"><HI>&s;ecundem Artem,</HI> the Faculty have not ad|mitted them into the Di&s;pen&s;ary.</P>
<P>Card-playing is the be&s;t and mo&s;t pro|per Cure, either for Love or De&s;pair; provided the Patients are Per&s;ons of Condition. Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> therefore applied her&s;elf ince&s;&s;antly to &s;o certain an Ab|&s;orbent.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> did not in every Party with her act con&s;i&s;tent with the Character of a Gentleman; for when he wanted Luck, he made it. N. B. This is a Sort of a Secret, and, like &s;ome Phra&s;es in Free Ma&s;onry, only known to the fellow Craft.</P>
<P>By Degrees her bad Run of Cards took all her ready Money; then &s;he played upon Honour; next &s;he pledged her Jewels to him; and, to redeem the Diamonds, &s;he was forced to leave her Honour in his Hands.</P>
<P>Thus we read of infatuated Victims making Compacts with the Prince of <HI>Pandemonium,</HI> his &s;ulphureous Maje&s;ty; and becau&s;e he &s;hould allow them to ap|pear in Splendor at pre&s;ent, give up to him for always, the only precious Thing or Part belonging to them.</P>
<P>O ye much rea&s;oning <HI>Literati,</HI> Why will ye not do &s;omething more, than ju&s;t tell us, like Guide-po&s;ts, the Way we have to go?&mdash;Why will ye not budge
<PB N="123" REF="126">your&s;elves? Do but once, ye Di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionates, hold in a dozen Hands at Ha|zard; take off your own Toa&s;t in a pint Bumper, or feel your&s;elves embra|ced in the dark Hour of A&s;&s;ignation; then ye would judge more like Men and Women of the World, and not expect we can become pure Philo&s;ophers on this Side Fifty.</P>
<P>By the Vigilance of Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>'s Ma|ma this Commerce was di&s;covered. Lady <HI>Grotto</HI> &s;urprizing <HI>Junior</HI> and her Daughter, in what &s;he called unlawful Trafficking; but &s;he re&s;olved to prevent the Affair from being blown, therefore took the Gentleman to her&s;elf, and or|dered Mi&s;s to prepare for her Marriage with Lord <HI>Pillow.</HI></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip was very polite, exce&s;|&s;ively good-natured, va&s;tly complai&s;ant, and ine&s;timably well bred; if any Thing, rather too ea&s;y. Seldom &s;peaking in Company; not but he was allowed to have a deal of Sen&s;e, only he had been often told, nothing could be wor&s;e than to affect Wit. Neither was he very curious, becau&s;e Enquiries would have &s;ometimes led him into Societies below his Birth; and a Man of Fa&s;hion &s;hould never have any Thing to &s;ay to the Vul|gar. He was never guilty of any ill-mannered
<PB N="124" REF="127">Contradictions; but entirely regulated by the Advice of his Friends, Relations, and Dome&s;tics. What they told him to be Ta&s;te, he believed to be &s;o. Was it either to build or pull down, to clump, or inclo&s;e, to &s;ub&s;cribe, to furni&s;h, to bet, to influence Elec|tions, to buy Pictures, breed running Hor&s;es, or addre&s;s a Lady.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance therefore of their Coun|cils, he paid his Attendance to Lady Dowager's Daughter; and Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> not caring to di&s;oblige her Mama, and as Nece&s;&s;ity, not Affection, had occa|&s;ioned the Intrigue between her and <HI>Ju|nior,</HI> &s;he gave his Lord&s;hip her Hand. The Wedding was &s;olemnized with all imaginable Magnificence.</P>

<P>Then there are always too many ano|nymous Writers, who (like Quacks) mu&s;t &s;tarve for Want of Bu&s;ine&s;s, had every Individual Under&s;tanding enough not to be impo&s;ed upon by their For|geries; but they with &s;pecious Pretence of public Utility, like a Toad under Sage, &s;pread their Poi&s;on un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>When Ladies and Gentlemen are up|on a Vi&s;it together (in this Kingdom) the Conver&s;ation is divided, as it was at Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s. For while <HI>Junior</HI> and the Squire were deeply engaged in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Nation, the Ladies were as
<PB N="128" REF="131">earne&s;t in expatiating upon Trolly, Gar|net, Trimmings, <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> Figures, Ser|vants Carele&s;sne&s;s, and <HI>French</HI> Varni&s;h.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Pillow</HI> endeavoured to ingratiate her&s;elf with Lady <HI>Fool,</HI> and &s;he &s;ucceed|ed to Admiration. The City Lady was charmed to hear the late Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> re|peat the Particularities of <HI>James</HI>'s Pari&s;h; and then, &s;uch elegant Notions as Lady <HI>Grotto</HI> had about fancying Furniture, and Notablene&s;s in dome&s;tic Management. They were prevailed upon by Lady <HI>Fool</HI> to &s;tay a Month at <HI>Fool-hall,</HI> and <HI>Junior</HI> was included in the Party.</P>
<P>One Morning, after all this good Company had been there about a Week, Lady <HI>Pillow</HI> left her lonely, unea&s;y Bed, much &s;ooner than is cu&s;tomary with the Delicate; her Mind was horribly di|&s;turbed; &s;he fancied a Walk in the Gar|den would be of Service. There &s;he happened to meet <HI>Junior,</HI> who, like her, had ro&s;e for the Benefit of Contempla|tion.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip, as they met, declared &s;he mu&s;t needs &s;peak with him imme|ciately. They came clo&s;e to a many pil|lar'd Building, generally called the <HI>Pan|theum;</HI> they a&s;cended the Steps, &s;he threw her&s;elf into a Cu&s;hion-covered Window-&s;eat; and after three or four
<PB N="129" REF="132">Sighs, which gave her animal Spirits &s;ufficient Relief, &s;he was enabled to de|liver intelligibly the following Words.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Junior,</HI> I find, that when a Lady has made one fal&s;e Step, &s;he's liable to trip all her Life after&mdash;You know the Obligations you have to me, I know the Connections 'twixt you and Mama&mdash;I mu&s;t have Mr. <HI>Fool.</HI></P>

<P>Your Sex are not always thus diffident of &s;ucceeding with ours&mdash;but that's no Matter&mdash;She has not Sen&s;e enough to love&mdash;no&mdash;I'll a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and let a Wo|man alone to win a Woman&mdash;I know her Foible&mdash;She drinks, Mr. <HI>Junior</HI>&mdash; Nay, you mu&s;t have perceived her, &s;ince we have vi&s;ited here, to have been &s;ome|times on the wrong-&s;ide Rea&s;on. Leave me to prepare the Way, and be you ready to improve the Opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> vowed an implicit Obedience, and both well plea&s;ed, returned into the Breakfa&s;t Parlour.</P>
<P>There is a famous pantomimical En|tertainment, called the Contention be|tween Rea&s;on and Will; but tho' it is hourly performed by Mankind's Com|pany of Comedians, yet the Players are not &s;o perfect in their Parts as they ought to be, the Study being &s;o very difficult.</P>
<P>Now on what is called the Theatre, Actors and Actre&s;&s;es may keep up their Con&s;equences, ju&s;t as they plea&s;e, &s;ince they appear not in inferior Ca&s;ts, but only now and then like Ea&s;tern Mo|narchs,

<P>But we on Life's real and various Stages cannot pre&s;erve the con&s;equen|tial Part of our Character; becau&s;e, as we are obliged every Day to make &s;ome Part of an Appearance, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that we mu&s;t &s;ometimes act out of Character.</P>
<P>Thus the once amiable Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> be|came deceitful, and the careful Lady <HI>Green&s;ay</HI> is metamorpho&s;ed into a Dram|drinker&mdash; once or twice in a Century &s;uch Things will happen.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>AN Opportunity &s;oon offered, which Lady <HI>Pillow</HI> did not neglect. The two Ladies had been one Afternoon <HI>Tete a Tete</HI> conver&s;ing together for two or three Hours; when a Walk to the <HI>Indian</HI> Pavillion, at the Bottom of the Garden, was propo&s;ed by Lady <HI>Grotto</HI>'s Daughter.</P>
<P>Arm in Arm they tripped along; by Chance <HI>Junior</HI> was there; ju&s;t when they were &s;eated Lady <HI>Pillow</HI> &s;tarted up, &s;he had lo&s;t one of her brilliant Drops, beg|ged to be excu&s;ed, and hurried out to hunt for it.</P>
<P>Now came on the fatal Time for Lady <HI>Fool</HI>&mdash;Always, it is &s;aid, again&s;t the Death of noble Per&s;onages, the Uni|ver&s;e is un&s;hipped, Creation's Anatomy di&s;located, and the Wheels of the World put out of Order. Mon&s;trous Births, Multiplication of Suns, Showers of red Ink, di&s;mal aerial Yells, and Jack-o-Lanthorn Dances are &s;een, heard, and wondered at.</P>
<P>Antient authentic Hi&s;tory abounds with Omens, and modern Memoriali&s;ts
<PB N="133" REF="136">throw in a Prodigy now and then, ju&s;t to grace their Annals with decent Horror.</P>
<P>For, as Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> &s;ays, when a great Man falls (i. e. one who has &s;acrificed about two Millions of Mankind, ju&s;t to make him&s;elf a great Man) yet at his Death Creation feels a Lo&s;s, and Dame Nature, like a di&s;tracted Parent, tears her&s;elf to Pieces.</P>
<P>Is it then to be doubted, that at the Death of Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s Honour, the fol|lowing Portents were forth-coming.</P>
<P>Cro&s;s the &s;ilvery &s;hining Moon, a broad black Cloud &s;pread like a mourn|ing Veil, as it were in Sorrow for the Lady's Lo&s;s. Behind the Alcove, a Bittern with Bill ingulphed, deep in the reedy Ditch, &s;ounded hoar&s;e; the whoop|ing Own for&s;ook its Ivy-tangled Cell; flittering Bats fled forth, blinking Bee|tles doleful hummed their nightly drone|ing Peal; the Hou&s;e-dog howled dread|ful; croaking Toads crawled cro&s;s the &s;mooth-mown Mead; a noi&s;ome Fog &s;pread its unwhole&s;ome Vapour; growl|ing Thunder rumbled over-head; the ru&s;tling Wind whi&s;tled hollow thro' the Rafters of an unroofed Barn, and a fa&s;t falling Shower rattling, pattered again&s;t the Sa&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="137">But in the very Honey-moon of this Intrigue&mdash;nay, before even Lady <HI>Pillow</HI> could reap any Advantage by it &mdash;it was de&s;troyed. Lady Dowager, too well experienced not to take Notice of the &s;lighte&s;t Neglect, di&s;covered that Lady <HI>Fool</HI> had clande&s;tinely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf of Lady <HI>Grotto</HI>'s Property in Mr. <HI>Junior;</HI> this the Dowager took Care to inform Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> of, nay, brought him to be Eve-witne&s;s of his own Di&s;|grace, unperceived either by his Lady, or her Paramour.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool</HI> bur&s;t into the Room, and in the Heart of Pa&s;&s;ion demanded Satisfac|tion; told <HI>Junior,</HI> he &s;hould wait for him by the old Chapel, and mounted his Hor&s;e immediately.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Junior</HI> had a proper Quantity of fa&s;hionable Spirit, which empowered him to back a bad Action with a wor&s;e, in a few Minutes followed him out of the Room, where he was met on the Landing-place by Lady <HI>Grotto,</HI> who up|braided him with Ingratitude, for his wronging his Ho&s;t. As for my Part, continued my Lady, your taking up with &s;uch a Per&s;on, after I have been weak enough to let you have any Thing to &s;ay to me, does not in the lea&s;t pique me&mdash;not in the lea&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure you, Mr.

<P>Lady <HI>Fool,</HI> whom Surprize had &s;tu|pefied, &s;at for four or five Minutes after the Antagoni&s;ts had left the Room, like <HI>Niobe,</HI> ju&s;t petrified; or, to make a more credible Simily, as when in the large Man&s;ion, waiting the Family's Return, a &s;ola-&s;itting Hou&s;ewife pores over the melancholy Page of <HI>Glan|ville</HI>'s Witches, the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Hobgob|lins,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;uch Daemon-rai&s;ing Work; as &s;he reads on, her Blood more chilly circulates; an angui&s;h Tremor agitates her Mu&s;cles; if then the Wind chances to blow ope her Doors, &s;he &s;eems fixed, as if froze &s;peechle&s;s; all

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;peak, is &s;omething &s;o &s;elf-plea&s;ing, that we are apt to talk, until we forget what we had to &s;ay. Thus it has happen'd to the Memoriali&s;t, who&s;e Digre&s;&s;ion almo&s;t drove the Hi|&s;tory out of his Head, or el&s;e he wou'd in the la&s;t Chapter have inform'd the Reader; that after <HI>Junior</HI> had got out of the Park-gate, mi&s;taking the Servants Directions, he turn'd to the Left, in|&s;tead of the Right; and at a Di&s;tance perceiving &s;omething upon a Hill, which he imagin'd to be the old Chapel, Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> mention'd, he gallop'd up to it forthwith.</P>
<P>As he mounted the Hill, he ob&s;erv'd it to be a large old &s;tone-built Barn, and rode up in Hopes of meeting &s;ome Per|&s;on to enquire his Way of.&mdash;He found a young Woman &s;itting at the Door, of whom he a&s;k'd his Road; but the in|form'd him &s;he was a Stranger travelling towards <HI>London,</HI> and begg'd he wou'd be&s;tow &s;omething upon her. Some Per|&s;ons when they are a&s;k'd for Charity, will give their Ble&s;&s;ing, but no Money; others are more ready to part with their
<PB N="143" REF="148">Per&s;ons than their Ca&s;h. <HI>Junior</HI> was at this Time in a loving Di&s;po&s;ition: The Girl look'd wanton, and whole&s;ome, and they went in to the Barn together, hanging his Hor&s;e at the Door, as his Girl de&s;ir'd him.</P>
<P>That was what his very yielding Mi|&s;tre&s;s wi&s;h'd for. She knew that behind the Barn her Man had hid him&s;elf, and was ready, as &s;oon as the fond Couple had retired, to mount the Gentleman's Hor&s;e, and gallop off with it, accord|ing to the Plan they had contriv'd, as they &s;aw <HI>Junior</HI> mounting the Hill. Her Fellow had but ju&s;t been clear'd at <HI>York</HI> Sizes, for want of Evidence, and they were tramping it to <HI>London;</HI> when <HI>Ju|nior</HI>'s Appearance gave them a Hint, to put in Practice the Scheme before-men|tion'd. It was executed with all imagin|able Succe&s;s, and <HI>Jack</HI> oblig'd to walk in his Boots above half a dozen Miles, before he cou'd find an Inn to put up at; from whence he &s;ent a Letter to Lady <HI>Pillow,</HI> to enquire how every Thing was at the Hall.</P>
<P>All was Di&s;traction there: Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> had &s;o endear'd him&s;elf to every Ser|vant, by his Behaviour, that the whole Hou&s;e was in an Uproar, when it came to be known he went out with Pi&s;tols to

<P>But you mu&s;tn't follow, you mu&s;t go along with me; and I'll tell you what, Doctor, bring that Thing Umbob with you;&mdash;it's like a Show, it may make my Lady laugh mayhap.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Rector,</HI> not caring to trouble him&s;elf with explaining any thing to <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> only thought fit &s;ilently to de&s;pi&s;e her for her Ignorance, and order'd his electrical Ap|paratus to be brought after him to Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s. As Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> and the Vicar cro&s;s'd the Clo&s;es, the Maid let him in|to &s;ome Part of the Hi&s;tory, relating to Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> and <HI>Junior</HI>'s going out together to fight.</P>

<P>When the Vicar, with Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> en|ter'd her Lady&s;hip's Apartment, Lady <HI>Fool</HI> was dozing,&mdash;her Woman too ha&s;tily waking her, made her Lady&s;hip &s;tart up affrighted; and her Eyes opening upon
<PB N="146" REF="151">Mr. <HI>Rector</HI>'s uncouth Appearance, added to her Terror. Altho' he was a Clergy|man, he had then nothing black about him but his Face and Hands; they were cru&s;ted over by the Smoke of his Expe|riments, and Du&s;t of his Study; a true philo&s;ophic Bronze, venerable as the Ru&s;t upon Medals.&mdash;He was a Man of too refin'd Notions to mind Externals. Superior to Form, and &s;o much ab&s;orb'd in &s;ublime Speculations, cou'd not con|&s;ult Dre&s;s, tho' he was to wait upon a Lady.&mdash;Mu&s;t Man? Prerogative po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing Man, cla&s;&s;ically and contempla|tively dignified; mu&s;t he de&s;cend to think, to act, or wear Clothes like eve|ry-day appearing Mortals?&mdash;No, thus Mr. <HI>Rector</HI> an&s;wer'd Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> who found Fault with his having a coar&s;e Flannel Night-cap on his Head, over which, Turban-like, a dirty Neckcloth was tied, and a much-worn red Bays Banyan cover'd the re&s;t of this Figure.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Fool,</HI> &s;truck with the Sight, holding up her out-&s;pread Hands, trem|bling utter'd,&mdash;My God! What's that? Je&s;us! I hope you don't come to rob me? A more cool Imagination than her Lady&s;hip's, might have been mi&s;taken in the Gentleman's Profe&s;&s;ion. But con|vinc'd by Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> of her Mi&s;take,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rector.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me Leave a Moment, my Lady, to con&s;ult with my&s;elf upon your Ca&s;e,&mdash; and immediately he threw him&s;elf into a meditating Attitude. He was like mo&s;t of his book-learn'd Brethren; of an un|forgiving contemptuous Spirit. She had taken him for a Felon,&mdash;that he cou'd not pa&s;s over,&mdash;but re&s;olv'd to let it re&s;t for a while, e&s;pecially as he concluded her to be delirious; therefore he deter|min'd to &s;ooth her by &s;oft Per&s;ua&s;ion, until his experimental Engine came; then he de&s;ign'd to cure her by Electri|fication, and publi&s;h her Ca&s;e with all the concurrent Circum&s;tances; and thus at once gratify the two mo&s;t indulg'd, the meane&s;t of all the Pa&s;&s;ions, Vanity, and Revenge. Setting one Hand by his
<PB N="148" REF="153">Side, and extending the other, he made with it a Sweep from his No&s;e to his Knees; at the &s;ame Time pawing forth his right Leg and Foot, nodded his Head; his Bow fini&s;hed, he &s;tood erect again, cough'd, hemm'd, and thus ora|torized.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Au&s;tin, Seneca, Cardan, Boetius, Plato</HI> and <HI>Epictetus,</HI> have di&s;criminately, my Lady, elucidated to us the Preven|tion of Grief; and what <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells us upon that Head is worthy Ob&s;erva|tion. Grief is in it&s;elf, as St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;ays, an Antithe&s;is to Joy; therefore the Poets have defined Sorrow to be joyle&s;s, or ab&s;tracted from Mirth. Hence, by the Con&s;triction, as well as Con&s;truction of the glandulous Valves, &s;timulated by the Diaphragma's Su&s;piration, the animal Spirits are jaculated into the la|chrymal Ducts, which occa&s;ions Tears.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rector.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity it is, that Duelling &s;hould be the Men of Mode's No&s;trum, when Electri|fying is &s;o much a &s;afer Panacea. I am, my Lady, con&s;cious of as much innate Bravery, as it is po&s;&s;ible for any Man to
<PB N="149" REF="154">po&s;&s;e&s;s; but mu&s;t I put my Life upon the impelled Velocity of a Bullet? Or &s;uffer my Heart to be a horizontal Mark for the acute Point of a Rapier to per|forate.</P>

<P>Oh! Mr. <HI>Rector,</HI> how can you talk about killing, when that dear Creature, my Hu&s;band, may a be murdering this Moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rector.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, if his Honour &s;hould be de|&s;troyed, I &s;hall be as much concerned for him, as a Philo&s;opher ought to be&mdash; the Man who kills him mu&s;t be hanged, and your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t be electrified.</P>
</SP>
<P>Word was brought him, that his elec|trifying Apparatus was come; he bid it be brought up Stairs, and began to &s;et it in order. Her Lady&s;hip, who had ne|ver &s;een any of that Sort before, &s;tared, and a&s;ked him if he was going to con|jure; but before he could an&s;wer her, <HI>Su&s;an</HI> bounced into the Room, over the Machine &s;he tumbled, cra&s;h! the gla&s;s Globe fell to the Ground, poor <HI>Su&s;an</HI> rowling about among the Pieces, &s;prawl|ing, kicking and &s;hrieking; but up &s;he &s;oon &s;crambled, and ran at Mr. <HI>Rector</HI> open-fi&s;ted; crying, Cur&s;e your Rattling Traps-&s;he &s;cratched, &s;he tore, &s;he bit
<PB N="150" REF="155">him; he calling out piteou&s;ly all the while, and at the &s;ame Time my Lady bawling her&s;elf black in the Face, with bidding <HI>Su&s;an</HI> leave off; but nothing could &s;top her Rage, but an Inability of Breath. As &s;oon as &s;he was out of Wind, the &s;uffering Vicar aro&s;e, bald-pated, his Band torn, his No&s;e bit in two Places, and his Face and Brea&s;t covered with Blood that came from <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s cut Fin|gers, which &s;he had mangled among the Bits of broken Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>My Lady could not bear to look up|on Mr. <HI>Rector,</HI> but begged he would go immediately to the Surgeon's, for &s;he vowed he looked horridly &s;hocking, and va&s;tly frightful. The Chaplain at that Moment ca&s;ting his Eyes upon the Look|ing-Gla&s;s, gave a great Groan, and ran down Stairs, crying out, a Doctor, a Doctor, for God's Sake. Oh, I &s;hall bleed to Death: Con&s;ider what the Lo&s;s of me will be; mine is no common Lo&s;s, the World will mi&s;s me. O that I had but publi&s;hed my Electrics; then I &s;hould have exi&s;ted to After-ages, with <HI>Bacon, Newton,</HI> and the re&s;t of my bro|ther Geniu&s;&s;es, like me, <HI>Britons,</HI> like me, Philo&s;ophers; but ah, unlike me in Fortune.&mdash;What, mu&s;t I die ignoted?

<P>We have already taken Notice of the Confu&s;ion all the Family was in at Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s being mi&s;&s;ing; and that the Ser|vants went &s;everal Ways to &s;eek him. Now the Stewards happened to be at the very Inn where <HI>Junior</HI> came to.</P>
<P>The faithful Dome&s;tic had him &s;eized, and carried him before a Ju&s;tice for murdering Mr. <HI>Fool;</HI> and as he could not give a very &s;atisfactory Account about his Hor&s;e nor him&s;elf, he was committed to Pri&s;on.&mdash;This was the News <HI>Su&s;an</HI> brought in &s;uch a Hurry, which occa|&s;ioned the electrical Cata&s;trophe above mentioned. It may be wondered at by &s;ome Readers, that Lady <HI>Grotto</HI> came not at this Time to comfort Lady <HI>Fool;</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="157">but the Dowager was all this Time em|ployed much more agreeably, at lea&s;t, as &s;he thought; being taken up with writing Letters to every one of her Ac|quaintance round the Country, in which the Hi&s;tory of Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s Infidelity and Di&s;grace was painted in a very plain and very particular Manner.</P>
<P>Not &s;o &s;atisfactory was her Daughter, Lady <HI>Pillow,</HI> amu&s;ed.

<P>Yes, I am the wicked Author of all this&mdash;He'll murder that charming Fel|low &mdash;Shoot him thro' the Back&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now Time to inform tho&s;e who have determined to read the&s;e Vo|lumes through, that after Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> had waited &s;ome Hours at the Place appoint|ed in vain, he began to con&s;ider what could be the Rea&s;on of <HI>Junior</HI>'s Ab|&s;ence. Certain I am (thus Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> &s;o|liloquized) he could not mi&s;take the Place; if he had a Mind to have met me, he might have been here before now. Perhaps Shame prevents him&mdash; it mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;Shall I &s;earch for him?&mdash; No&mdash;Home I am determined not to return; and, upon the&s;e Words, &s;pur|ring on his Hor&s;e, he gallopped acro&s;s the Country.</P>
<P>After he had hurried along about thirty Miles, he found Night overtake him very fa&s;t, as he entered upon a large Moor; he was quite ignorant of the Country, and as it grew dark, <HI>Tom Fool</HI> laid the Reins loo&s;e upon his Hor&s;e's Neck, and &s;uffered the Bea&s;t to go which Way he plea&s;ed. The Hor&s;e, kept with|out Food for the whole Day, was &s;eek|ing &s;omething to eat, when his fore Feet broke down the Earth, and he
<PB N="158" REF="163">fell with his Rider into a deep Pit, from whence Stones and Slates formerly were dug. The Bea&s;t died upon the Spot, and Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> with much Difficulty di&s;|engaging him&s;elf from the Carca&s;e, too much brui&s;ed to get up without Help, was forced to remain below till Morn|ing, when he was found and relieved by the greate&s;t Accident imaginable.</P>
<P>One of the many elegant and inno|cent Amu&s;ements which young Ladies of Fa&s;hion kill Part of their Morning Time with, is collecting and arranging curious Shells and uncommon Pebbles.</P>
<P>To obey a Lady's Orders, the Morn|ing after Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Fall, Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> had taken a Walk to the Quarry, Peb|ble-hunting; there he found <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> and had him conveyed to a Farm-hou&s;e, the only Dwelling for many Miles round.</P>
<P>This Man&s;ion &s;tood in the mid&s;t of a large uncultivated Common, which was over&s;pread with Furze, Thi&s;tles, Fern, Ru&s;hes, and Turf Pools, for want of being properly enclo&s;ed. For as it as divided into &s;everal Lord&s;hips, the Per|&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its different Manors, were not unanimous about draining, diking and improving it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Selzy Simkrimp</HI> would not come in|to it, becau&s;e, as he told his Spou&s;e,
<PB N="159" REF="164">while he pointed his Finger over the Land Surveyor's Plan; only mind me, my Dear, if I con&s;ent to this Affair, Widow <HI>Wail</HI> comes in for four Acres and two Perch more than I have.</P>
<P>His Curate took the Liberty to hint, that inclo&s;ing would be a Means of em|ploying a Number of Poor, who&s;e Fa|milies were now &s;tarving; that Charity was of heavenly Birth; that he hoped the Great, the Rich, and Powerful would now and then conde&s;cend to think, that the poore&s;t Creatures are their fellow Creatures; made of the &s;ame Materials, quickened by the &s;ame Spirit, and &s;up|ported by the &s;ame Elements. Then Sympathy, nay, even ba&s;e Self-Love, would dole out &s;ome Superfluities to feed the Hungry, to cloath the Naked.</P>
<P>Let's have none of your Non&s;en&s;e; (in|terrupted the Baronet) as to Poor, we have too many already, and damn'd high A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments; and if the&s;e Wretches can get Children now they are half &s;tarv'd, What would they do, if they had their Bellies full? I &s;ay, they that &s;tand up for the Poor, only encourage Poachers, and our Game is thin enough already, &s;o I'll not give my Vote for it.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="165">And, if I do, I'll be damn'd replied Squire <HI>Bitt,</HI> it would de&s;troy all my Co|ver for Hares.</P>
<P>From this modern Way of Rea&s;oning, but one Con&s;equence could be &s;uppo&s;ed; it was totally neglected, except &s;ome Acres round the Hou&s;e, to which Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> had been carried.</P>
<P>The Tenant of which Habitation, in her Youth, had been a celebrated Lady of Plea&s;ure, and dealt formerly with mo&s;t of the Gentlemen belonging to that County.</P>
<P>When &s;he, according to the common Cu&s;tom of her Profe&s;&s;ion, fell to De|cay, the neighbouring Gentlemen, out of Gratitude (as they will &s;ometimes maintain worn out Hunters) fitted up Part of an old Hall, &s;tock'd &s;ome Ground round it, and gave it to her for Life. It was to this Hou&s;e <HI>Tom Fool</HI> was carried.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time that Morning, Lady <HI>Grotto,</HI> with Lord and Lady <HI>Pil|low,</HI> took their Leaves of Lady <HI>Fool;</HI> her Lady&s;hip immediately after retiring to her Chamber overwhelmed with Af|fliction.</P>
<P>Here&mdash;here&mdash;&s;eems to be a Stagna|tion of the Story, or the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Story; for the Editor, like a &s;avage-minded

<P>One Misfortune &s;eldom comes alone, for <HI>Junior</HI> found, on his Return to Pri&s;on, an Action lodg'd again&s;t him by the Inn-keeper, for criminal Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf pre&s;s'd by the Law, and de&s;erted by his Friends, he thought that Things were almo&s;t over with him; however, he was re&s;olv'd not to fling up his Cards, while there &s;eem'd to be a Probability of recovering the Game, therefore began to &s;cheme accordingly.</P>
<P>Hunger will break through Stone Walls, and Money he knew to have that hungry Quality.

</SP>
<P>This Scheme, as it was really a very deep one, the Hu&s;band admired; and they lay awake until Morning, con&s;ider|ing how, and in what Way, they &s;hould put out the fifty Guineas.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Junior,</HI> not having the &s;econd &s;ighted Gift, remained a Stranger to this Plot. Ob&s;erving the Hu&s;band not to take any Notice of it next Day, hinted it to him again; but the Goaler begged him, for God's Sake, not to think of it,
<PB N="168" REF="173">for he wouldn't do &s;uch a Thing for the World.</P>
<P>Per&s;everance is as much the Property of a Game&s;ter, as a Lover&mdash;but it would not do&mdash;the Man was &s;till ob&s;tinate&mdash; <HI>Junior</HI> changed his Plan, &s;ounded the Wife, and found her very pliable; &s;he con&s;ented, upon Con&s;ideration of <HI>Junior</HI>'s giving her &s;ixty Guineas (&s;he had a Mind to keep Ten to her&s;elf) &s;he would let Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> out of the Goal, into an empty Hou&s;e, and give him the Key of the Street Door, and he might let him&s;elf out; but he mu&s;t &s;tay till the Nights were dark, and her Hu&s;band gone out of Town.</P>
<P>The long expected Time came at la&s;t, her Hu&s;band was gone a Journey, or at lea&s;t pretended, in <HI>Junior</HI>'s Hear|ing, to do &s;o. <HI>Junior</HI> then went up with the Goaler's Wife, into what was called the <HI>French</HI> Chamber, and there he told out before her Face &s;ixty Guineas; after &s;he had taken up &s;everal and exa|mined them, they that were not filed or fal&s;e, he re-placed them in the Bag a|gain, tied up the Mouth, and held it in his Hand, ready to make her a Pre&s;ent of it, the Moment &s;he had conducted him pa&s;t the Pri&s;on Walls. She had a Candle and Lanthorn along with her;
<PB N="169" REF="174">when they parted, he received the Lan|thorn and Candle, &s;he the Bag. <HI>Junior</HI> entered the one Pair of Stairs of the Ho&s;ier's Hou&s;e, &s;he went to the Goal-door, to let her Hu&s;band know (who was waiting there) that the Gentleman was coming; and then &s;he went to her Bureau to lock up the Money.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Cunning are frequently the greate&s;t Dupes, thus it was with <HI>Junior;</HI> he had no Su&s;picion of the intended Am|bu&s;h; but merely by In&s;tinct and Expe|rience from former Practices, he &s;at the Lanthorn down in a Corner, and &s;oftly opened a Sa&s;h to look into the Street, and li&s;ten if any Per&s;ons were pa&s;&s;ing. At that In&s;tant Mr. Mayor's Coach hap|pened to be going Home, with his Wor|&s;hip and Family from a Vi&s;it, and a Footman carrying a lighted Flambeaux behind, illuminated the whole Street; ju&s;t as the Coach pa&s;&s;ed along, <HI>Junior</HI> di&s;covered underneath him &s;everal Per|&s;ons with Watchmen's Bills &s;tanding round the Door of the Hou&s;e he was in. He had now need of all his Fortitude; without &s;hutting down the Sa&s;h, &s;oftly on Tip-toe he &s;tepped back again, took the Lanthorn, and hurried up Stairs in|to the back Garrets in Search for a Trap|door or Ca&s;ement, which opened upon
<PB N="170" REF="175">the Leads; very luckily he found one quickly; out he got, and after a Trial or two, found the Gutter would bear him; along &s;ideling he crept, his Hands upon the Tiles, until he was &s;topped by a Ladder, which lay &s;tanding in his Way. This he conjectured might have &s;ome Communication with others lower; and after &s;ome Time feeling about (for he had put out his Light) he found a Bun|dle of &s;caffolding Cords, one End of which he made fa&s;t to the uppermo&s;t Ladder, and depending on that, and in Hopes of more Ladders, he began to de&s;cend; what with &s;liding and &s;cram|bling, he found him&s;elf at la&s;t &s;afe land|ed in a narrow Lane; ju&s;t then he heard the Min&s;ter Clock &s;trike One; guided by that Sound, he walked towards the Church-yard, where he expected to find waiting for him a Friend, and a couple of fleet Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>For, unknown to the Goalor'd Lady, after he had fixed the Night and Hour in which he was to leave his Pri&s;on, he ordered one in whom he could confide, to be in the Min&s;ter-yard with a Brace of Geldings when the Clock &s;truck Twelve, and &s;tay till <HI>Junior</HI> came. <HI>Jack</HI> rightly judging it was a Place which at that Time of Night few Peo|ple
<PB N="171" REF="176">would walk through, therefore his Groom and Cattle might &s;ecrete them|&s;elves there; and al&s;o <HI>Junior</HI> could find the Place more readily than any other.</P>
<P>How did the Per&s;on in Waiting re|joice, when he heard <HI>Junior</HI> whi&s;tle the Signal! Not that it was Joy, proceeding from a Heart-felt Satisfaction, to hear his Friend was at Liberty&mdash;no&mdash;he was glad he had got Company. For Mr. <HI>Junior</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tant, tho' one of the bolde&s;t Fellows living, nay, had actually fought a Duel, yet began to be very unea&s;y; as he &s;taid a|mong the Graves and Tomb-&s;tones, a cold Sweat bedewed his Face and Brea&s;t, and he was at la&s;t &s;o far Pannic-&s;truck, that when the Clock went Twelve, he would have left <HI>Junior</HI> to get off alone, as well as he could, but had not Strength to get from the Tomb-&s;tone on which he had laid him&s;elf at Length upon his Brea&s;t, his Hands cro&s;s his Eyes.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o tremenduou&s;ly gloomifical as Mr. *** ob&s;erves, in a Church-yard at Midnight, and only then, as mu&s;t appal the &s;toute&s;t among Men. This was what the Per&s;on declared to <HI>Junior,</HI> after they had got the Town upon their Backs; &s;aying, Look ye, <HI>Jack Junior,</HI> tho' as to Religion, to be &s;ure, I know it all to be Prie&s;t|craft;
<PB N="172" REF="177">and as to Par&s;ons, they are no more knowing than other Men&mdash;How &s;hould they? You know, and every Body el&s;e knows, I a'nt afeard of no|thing; yet, damme, if ever I was &s;o out of Sorts as I was, when I was among them Tomb-&s;tones; and if I could have &s;aid the Lord's Prayer by Heart, or any Thing about the Bible, I believe I &s;hould have pattered no|thing el&s;e all the Time after the Clock &s;truck Twelve; for, cur&s;e me, <HI>Jack Junior,</HI> tho' Iv'e more Sen&s;e than to believe a Word what &s;uch Fellurs as Par|&s;ons Jaw, yet I'll hold five Pound to a Shilling, and I &s;ay done fir&s;t, that no Man in the World can &s;tay in a Church-yard at Midnight, without &s;weating for it.</P>
<P>Here would we give you the An&s;wer his Companion made him; but they both began to gallop along &s;o fa&s;t, hav|ing found them&s;elves on the Turnpike Road, that they were too &s;oon out of Ear-&s;hot, for us to take down, even in &s;hort Hand, the re&s;t of their Conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>Now to return to the Pri&s;on-keeper, after he and his Followers had waited them&s;elves out of all Patience, he di&s;|patched his Wife back, to go into the
<PB N="173" REF="178">very Place to which &s;he had inducted <HI>Junior,</HI> and &s;ee what was become of him. As &s;oon as &s;he had been all over the Hou&s;e, &s;he bawled out of the Win|dow <HI>Jack</HI> had left open, Oh Lord! he's got out a-Top, he has got out a Top. The empty Hou&s;e Street-door they cou'dn't force open, <HI>Junior</HI> had the Key in his Pocket; they were forced to go round through the Goal, and they &s;oon di&s;covered the Trap-door open, but not one would venture out; alledging, they had Families, and who'd maintain their poor Babes, if any Thing misfortunable was to happen to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Alarm by this Time was &s;pread through the Neighbourhood, that the Gentleman Murderer had made his E&s;|cape; the Mayor was informed of it, and he &s;ent immediately for the Goalor, to be a&s;certained of the Truth of the Report.</P>
<P>When her Spou&s;e went to wait upon the Mayor, Madam, the Goalor's Lady retired to her Bed-chamber, opened her Che&s;t of Drawers, took out the Bag <HI>Junior</HI> had given her, and united it, to take Care of the ten &s;upernumerary Pieces, which, as &s;he had bargained for un|known to her Hu&s;band, &s;he was unwil|ling
<PB N="174" REF="179">he &s;hould come to hear of, for Fear he might be angry with her.</P>
<P>Out into her Lap &s;he pours the pre|cious Trea&s;ure&mdash;a&mdash;ha&mdash;oh, my &s;weet Je&s;us! Thus &s;he &s;hrieked out, &s;tarted up, and down fell all the Contents of the Bag upon the Floor, and &s;he upon them, da&s;hing her Hands up and down among them; for in&s;tead of &s;ixty Guineas good and lawful Money of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> there was nothing but &s;mall Leads of Sleeves, thick Pieces of Gla&s;s ground round, Pieces of Pewter, and bra&s;s Curtain Rings. There, amid&s;t the Heap, like the Story of <HI>Danae,</HI> done by a Sign|po&s;t Painter, &s;he lay in a violent Fit, not one Struggle of it feigned. After burning all the Matches they could come at under her No&s;e, it was as much as her Maid could do to keep her from relap&s;ing.</P>
<P>Her Spou&s;e returned from Mr. Mayor's with a very di&s;contented Mind; his Wor&s;hip threatened him to take the Goalor's Place from him, if the Pri&s;oner was not forth-coming; all he comforted him&s;elf as he walked Home was, that, let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, he had fifty Guineas to begin the World with.</P>
<P>When he came into the Chamber, where the Maid was &s;at on the Ground;
<PB N="175" REF="180">holding his Wife's Head in her Lap; and all the counterfeit Pieces &s;cattered about her, he cry'd out, What the De|vil, and be damn'd to it, is this?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Hu&s;band, it's no Matter&mdash;oh&mdash;but we're ruined, that's all&mdash;oh! Lord&mdash;then fell into another Fit; which, after &s;ome Trouble, they brought her out of; and &s;he told her Hu&s;band, that in&s;tead of the fifty Guineas, the Ra&s;cal had given her that Stuff which lay about the Floor.</P>
</SP>
<P>Indeed, &s;ome People are to be pitied; for after he had li&s;tened with. A&s;toni&s;h|ment to her broken Relation, often in|terrupted with Sobs, and was convinced he was undone, without making her any Reply, down Stairs he went to look for his Hor&s;e-whip; and ju&s;t as he had laid Hand on that, he was laid Hands on by two of Mr. Mayor's Officers, and car|ried, by his Wor&s;hip's Order, to the black Hole, for aiding <HI>Junior</HI>'s E&s;cape; who was then with his Companion, mak|ing the be&s;t of his Way to <HI>London,</HI> once more to cut a Figure; but whether in the Se&s;&s;ions-paper as a Felon, or in the News-paper, for marrying a great For|tune, Time only can be the Tell-tale.</P>
<P>'Tis Odds indeed, but that he is re|warded for acting on the wrong-&s;ide of
<PB N="176" REF="181">Equity, &s;ooner than puni&s;hed for it; which makes out what <HI>Hamlet</HI> ob&s;erves, about there being more Things in Hea|ven and Earth, than are found out by Philo&s;ophy; if not, we might account why Vi&s;age-wearing Roguery &s;hall dine upon Turtle, and open-countenanc'd Hone&s;ty &s;tarve in <HI>forma Pauperis.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>Fool</HI> was very ho&s;pitably re|ceived at the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, to which, by the Order of Mr. <HI>Borlace,</HI> he was carried.</P>
<P>With the Lady, who we have already mentioned to be in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Dwelling-place, there boarded a young Gentlewoman, to whom Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> was a great Favourite.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as their Gue&s;t, Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> was well enough recovered to &s;ee Company, they made him a Vi&s;it, at which Time <HI>Borlace</HI> ob&s;erving all their Endeavours to di&s;&s;ipate his Melancholy were ineffectual (fir&s;t making a proper Apology for his Abruptne&s;s) addre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> as fol|lows.</P>

<PB N="178" REF="183">Sir, we'll relate to you our pa&s;t Lives; and you know, Sir, what we are taught at School, that it is a Comfort to the Sorrowful to have Partners in Affliction.</P>

<P>I am indeed, Sir, very much hurt in my Mind, yet &s;hould be grieved to find any one &s;o unfortunate as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Borlace.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, I leave you to judge; my Name, Sir, is <HI>Witwood Borlace,</HI> a Name, I believe, once as well known in the gay Life of <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Fanny Murray</HI>'s. I am a Man of Family, and con&s;equently a Man of Ambition; but the Mode of my Mind was not con&s;tituted either for Field Sports at Home, or Campaigns Abroad; all my Wi&s;h, Joy and Pride, centered in being called a clever Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<P>To be a Man of Wit and Humour, is a Character eagerly &s;ought after, like the great Prize in the Lottery; and the World will put in, becau&s;e each Indivi|dual thinks he may pretend to it. But that's not the Thing, every Lady is not born to be a Toa&s;t, nor every Man to be a Genius.</P>
<P>One Thing that led me to aim at &s;o plea&s;ing a Title was, I had a prodigious Share of Spirits, and from my Induction
<PB N="179" REF="184">at College, to this pre&s;ent Time, they never failed me.</P>
<P>I was forced, indeed, to leave the Univer&s;ity &s;ooner than I expected, on Account of the fir&s;t Piece of Wit I ever attempted. I put a Piece of hot Coal on my Tutor's Shoe, as the old Fellow lay a&s;leep; it happened to lame him in|deed, but that was more than I intended.</P>
<P>When I returned to my Father's, I was ordered to prepare my&s;elf to make the grand Tour, but an Aunt of mine objecting to him, how weak it was in Parents &s;ending their Sons Abroad, be|fore they had &s;een their own Country, I had Liberty allowed me to go with her to <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;oon take Notice of for my va&s;t Spirits, and made Principal in mo&s;t Parties of Plea&s;ure, until the &s;atyrical Talent which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, made me be thought too &s;evere a Companion; and I was in Con&s;equence of that left out of &s;everal future Invitations.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ed me, for I was fond of being dreaded. I lampooned away, and enjoyed the Anxiety which it gave to &s;e|veral at the <HI>Spaw,</HI> who would have poi|&s;oned me if they dared. I had imbibed the Opinion from &s;everal Ladies of Fa|&s;hion,
<PB N="180" REF="185">that to give Pain was the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure imaginable.</P>
<P>My Father had been &s;ome Years a Widower, and ju&s;t as I came of Age, dying, left me a large unincumbered E&s;tate, with &s;ome Thou&s;ands in ready Money; then I began to execute my Plan, which was, to be the tip-top Fel|low for Fun, Frolick, Wit and Hu|mour upon the Town.</P>
<P>I gave over all Thoughts of going a|broad, being con&s;cious that my own Country could furni&s;h me with Curio&s;i|ties enow for Entertainment; however, that I might not be di&s;e&s;teemed for a De|ficiency of Ta&s;te, I employed Per&s;ons, who under&s;tood tho&s;e Things, to furni&s;h me with a proper Quantity of Pictures, Etchings, Medals, Bronzes, Cameo's, Intaglias, Antiques and Petrifactions.</P>
<P>While my Hou&s;e, Cabinets and Cu|rio&s;ities were fitting up in <HI>London,</HI> I went to an E&s;tate I had in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> with half a Dozen exce&s;&s;ive droll Fellows, to practi&s;e all the Species of Wit and Hu|mour I intended to be excellent in.</P>
<P>After being ab&s;ent a Year, I bur&s;t on the Town a Prodigy. I was allowed to be the greate&s;t Genius that ever embelli&s;hed an Evening's Conver&s;ation. I could take off <HI>Ryan,</HI> and the blind Man with his
<PB N="181" REF="186">Bladder and String. I could play upon my Coat's Skirt like a Bag-pipe, and make an old Woman's Face upon my Hand. I could make a Fiddle go like a <HI>German</HI> Flute, and grunt with my Mouth like an Organ; could do all the <HI>London</HI> Cries, and play a Solo upon a Broom&s;tick; &s;ound a Trumpet from the Corner of my Hat, and play a Volun|tary by &s;napping my Fingers. I was the be&s;t Hand in <HI>England</HI> upon the Salt|box, and nobody &s;ung the <HI>Welch</HI> Song like me; then I could growl like <HI>Quin,</HI> and &s;quint like Par&s;on <HI>Whitfield;</HI> and every Body allowed, at my own Table, I &s;aid as many good Things as any Man in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There we was one Thing very remark|able about me, which was, tho' I had an exce&s;&s;ive Share of Spirits, they never hurried me into any particular Extrava|gancies. I dete&s;ted Gaming; as to to&s;|&s;ing up for the Reckoning now and then, or buying a few Lottery Tickets, ju&s;t to make Pre&s;ents with, tho&s;e were Trifles not worth talking of, and what would not hurt any Body; but I was determined never to be taken in. So, tho' I have had all the tip-top Women of the Town, they never had me; they loved me as a clever Fellow, but I was too knowing
<PB N="182" REF="187">to be a Keeper; I have, indeed, &s;ome|times made one Lady a Pre&s;ent of a Piece of Plate, and folded up a Bank-bill two or three Times, and flung it by way of Frolick at another; What then?

<P>While I was amu&s;ing my&s;elf in this Manner. I received a little Damage from a Gentleman, who&s;e Wife I had toa&s;ted as a <HI>Demirep;</HI> I retired into the Country a little while to recruit both my Con&s;ti|tution and Circum&s;tances; for tho' I had not been very high above five Years, I had &s;omehow or other run my E&s;tate a little out of Breath.</P>
<P>During my being ru&s;ticated, I mar|ried an Heire&s;s with 7000 l. in her own Hands, which &s;he put me in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of on the Day of Marriage; but had &s;he not been one of the fine&s;t Women in <HI>England,</HI> as to Per&s;on, her Money &s;hould never have made me trammel my&s;elf in the matrimonial Tether. I was
<PB N="183" REF="188">always too full of Spirits for a dome&s;tic &s;edentary Life, I could not bear Con|finement, cooped up like a tame Rab|bit; no, I mu&s;t run wild about the Fo|re&s;t like a free bred Buck, or, as <HI>Lo|thario</HI><Q>&s;ays, like the Birds, great Na|ture's happy Commoners.</Q></P>
<P>I brought my Bride up to Town, to let the World bear Witne&s;s to my Hap|pine&s;s; I &s;howed her off at every public Place; &s;he was not quite &s;o fond of O&s;|tentation as &s;he ought to have been; I could perceive Operas and Routs not &s;o infinitely agreeable to her, as I could have wi&s;hed them; &s;he was rather too rural in her Ta&s;te; for by all that's odd, &s;he whi&s;pered me in the Ear only at the &s;econd Ma&s;querade we were at, that &s;he thought it very in&s;ipid. Superlatively &s;imple you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e her to be, not but now and then &s;he was well enough: In her Opinion, as far as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Au|thor; or, as <HI>Garrick</HI>'s acting, any Thing in the &s;erious Way plea&s;ed her well enough.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in that <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Execution exce&s;&s;ively clever; I can, I believe, without Vanity, do as many droll Things, as all the choice Spirits put together; but I don't know how it is, I never could get at what he does; as to
<PB N="184" REF="189">the re&s;t of the Actors, I was at Home; but he has got a Sort of a Knack that's pa&s;t finding out, and yet he &s;eems &s;o ea&s;y in what he does, as if it was natural to him. I believe, in acting, as well as free Ma&s;onry, there's a Secret not to be divulged. I beg Pardon, Sir, for this Ob&s;ervation, but theatrical Knowledge is as u&s;eful for a Man of Fortune in <HI>London,</HI> as cla&s;&s;ical Knowledge is at the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>My Wife, after we had been in Town about two Months, began, tho' in the mo&s;t tender Manner, to complain I ab|&s;ented my&s;elf too much from her, wi&s;h'd to have a little more of my Company, begged me, &s;ince I was &s;o very entertain|ing Abroad, that I would indulge her now and then with my Conver&s;ation at Home. It went again&s;t me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to deny her, but I had &s;o many Invitations, and was &s;o univer&s;ally ad|mired as a Companion, I could not help it; as to plea&s;ing one's Wife, or the Plea&s;ure a Man can receive from her Ap|plau&s;e, it was not forcible enough for one of my Spirits, yet I made a &s;ecret Re&s;olution, altho' I was too much from her at pre&s;ent, when I grew old, &s;he &s;hould have me all to her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="190">I have &s;ometimes &s;ince thought, that a Man may have too great a Quantity of Spi|rits; for I could not &s;tay at Home, and I was fearful too if I had, that the World would have given out, I had drowned my Faculties in the Cawdle-cup. The Ambition I had to be counted the cle|vere&s;t Fellow in <HI>England,</HI> forced me to enter too much into the Spirit of Things. I &s;at up too late, drank too deep, u&s;ed rather too much Ridicule, and &s;lighted the fine&s;t Woman in <HI>England,</HI> and all often again&s;t my Inclination &mdash; but he who has a Mind to gain a great Name, mu&s;t &s;acrifice his private Connections to the Opinions of the Public.</P>
<P>My Wife, to wean me, as &s;he thought, from what here Country Simplicity called dangerous Habits, told me, that mo&s;t of my Friends, tho' &s;he would not parti|cularize them, were Villains; that they had at different Times hinted Love to her, therefore begged me to be more at Home, if it was only to protect her from &s;uch In&s;ults for the future.</P>
<P>But I &s;aw through the Scheme; &s;he was a good Girl, but a bad Politician. I &s;miled and told her, Politene&s;s and Sincerity were as incompatible, as <HI>Hudi|bras</HI> and Algebra, or common Sen&s;e and much Ceremony; that the more Men
<PB N="186" REF="191">made Love to my Wife, only proclaim'd the more the Goodne&s;s of my Ta&s;te, in fixing upon &s;o ine&s;timable a Jewel. I was con&s;cious, I told her, &s;he loved me, bid her not be whim&s;ical, chucked her under the Chin, vowed I adored her, ordered a Chair, and dined with <HI>Lucy Cooper.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe the Lady I married, was not only one of the fine&s;t Women in <HI>England,</HI> but as good a one as ever lived. I had not indeed an Opportunity to di&s;cover all her good Qualities; but this was the Character every Body gave her. I &s;hould not have been a Stranger to her Perfections, had not an unlucky Accident happened, which deprived me from con&s;idering her in &s;o amiable a Light as I ought to have done; but Reflections are ridiculous, few People know the Value of an E&s;|tate, till they have made away with it.</P>
<P>Thus it happen'd with me, Sir; I had not been married to her much above a Twelvemonth, before I lo&s;t her; that was another Joke carried a little too far too. But a Man at all Times don't know where to &s;top, when he is in high Spirits.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, on Afternoon, my Wife then had ju&s;t been brought to
<PB N="187" REF="192">Bed a Week. I had dined that Day at <HI>Tomkyns</HI>'s; I was in high Spirits, and took three or four Friends Home with me, to hum an old Par&s;on, a Relation of my Wife's, whom I had promi&s;ed to &s;pend the Evening with. I knew I &s;hou'd undergo a Jobation from him; but to &s;top his Mouth, Sir <HI>Grecian Grigg</HI> and I began a &s;ham Fight, in the old one's Company.</P>
<P>One of my Wife's fooli&s;h Maids run &s;creaming to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, that I &s;hou'd be murdered among the drawn Swords, and in &s;pite of her Servants, my Wife was &s;o Head&s;trong, that &s;he wou'd come down Stairs only in her Wrapper and Slippers, altho' &s;he had not lain in above &s;even or eight Days.</P>
<P>We &s;oon convinc'd her it was only a Piece of Wit and Humour; but to &s;ee how uneven the Tempers of &s;ome La|dies are; tho' &s;he tripp'd down Stairs as nimble as a Wench at a Wake, her Spirits took &s;uch a Turn, that it was as much as all her Maids cou'd do to lift her up Stairs again.&mdash;She died in three Day's Time: I fancy &s;he was piqued to be taken in &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>However, no Man cou'd be more afflicted at parting from his Wife than I was: I had lo&s;t one of the fine&s;t Figures
<PB N="188" REF="193">in <HI>England.</HI> Indeed I erected a fine Monument for her, and kept my Room a whole Week, to compo&s;e her Epitaph, and without Vanity, I may &s;ay, that no Hu&s;band cou'd give more unfeign'd Te&s;timonies of his Affection than I did, in the Care I took of having her Memory celebrated.</P>
<P>After her Decea&s;e, I found my riche&s;t and greate&s;t Friends di&s;continued their Vi&s;its. I was in Repartee too &s;evere, for I never wou'd &s;ink my Joke to &s;ave my Friend; no wonder then they ab|&s;ented them&s;elves, as they had the Laugh &s;o often again&s;t them, e&s;pecially now they knew the only Per&s;on was gone who took their Parts.</P>
<P>I had then no other Vi&s;itors but tho&s;e who&s;e Circum&s;tances made it worth their while to fill their Bellies at my Table, tho' they were &s;ure to be roa&s;ted for it. I &s;oon grew tired with tho&s;e to whom I gave a Dinner, only becau&s;e they wanted one; their Applau&s;es were as in&s;ipid to me as the Care&s;&s;es of a Wife, three Months after Marriage. I left off Hou&s;e-keeping, took Lodgings near <HI>Arthur</HI>'s, and was balloted into the Jockey Club.</P>
<P>Here was a new Field for Game; I cleared away a few Acres of Wood-land,
<PB N="189" REF="194">ju&s;t to make an exerci&s;ing Place, run up a rubbing Hou&s;e, bought a Brace of brood Mares, got my Compliment of Colts, and ju&s;t till my own Stud was ri&s;en four Years old, I purcha&s;ed three or four capital Plate Hor&s;es; for as I was determined to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, I knew there was no doing tho&s;e Things by Halves, and to compleat me for the Turf, I had &s;everal Hints from <HI>Pond,</HI> how to lay my Money.</P>
<P>I began rather too late, I believe; for tho' no Man ever had better Hor&s;es than my&s;elf, nor won more Plates, nor was oftener let into the Secret; yet, damn it, let them &s;ay what they will, there is &s;uch a Thing as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uck, ay, and bad Luck too; for in about five Years, my E&s;tate, my Hor&s;es and Grooms all gallopped away to the Devil, leaving me at a dead Stand-&s;till, in a Spunging-hou&s;e, tho' there I had the Satisfaction to hear the Baileys allow, that they be|lieved me to be one of the clevere&s;t Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After I had recovered my Liberty, I entered into Life as droll as ever I was, not quite &s;o rich tho': But what is Mo|ney to a Man of Spirit? I u&s;ed to treat, now I was treated; to&s;&s;ed into the Reckoning; but I was welcome every
<PB N="190" REF="195">where, and every Body admired my va&s;t Sprits.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom Fool.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, did not you begin to think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Borlace.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, when a Man of Wit and Humour begins to think, he lo&s;es all Preten&s;ions to tho&s;e Titles, as a Beauty cea&s;es to be a Toa&s;t, when &s;he becomes a married Woman. Be&s;ides, I really lived &s;o joyous, I had no Time for Reflection. I u&s;ed to be engaged from Party to Party, that I had no Hours to my&s;elf, nor indeed did I wi&s;h for any; I was ju&s;t like a new celebrated Woman of Plea&s;ure, every one wi&s;hed to be in Company with me.</P>
</SP>
<P>As to the Woman of the Town, I vi&s;ited all of them, and knew every <HI>De|mirep,</HI> and fre&s;h Face; and as it was not in my Power to be as generous to them as I had been, I re&s;olved to be u&s;e|ful in helping them to &s;everal rich Bucks of my Acquaintance, who could not &s;o conveniently have met together, had I not contrived it. I did it to &s;erve my Friends, and looked upon it as a Point of Honour, &s;o did the Girls; for tho' Prudes may &s;ay what they will, tho&s;e Sort of Women have more Honour a|bout them than People imagine. They
<PB N="191" REF="196">always received me with open Arms, but a Man may be &s;ick with Sweet-meats; I was at la&s;t in that &s;ickly Condition, which the mode&s;t Part of the female Sex have no Pity for.</P>
<P>When I was tolerably well, an old Acquaintance of mine invited me down to his Country Seat for the Summer. This was a real Piece of Friend&s;hip; I told him &s;o, when I con&s;ented to the Pro|po&s;al: His An&s;wer was, why, look ye, <HI>Borlace,</HI> you are a damn'd droll Fellow, to be &s;ure, and can keep it up as well as any Man in <HI>England,</HI> therefore you'll be quite in Character with me; for as the general Election is coming, &s;uch a Man as you among my Friends is worth a Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Away we went, in tip-top Spirits, Faith. I &s;han't tire you with the Tricks we played upon the Road, about our humming the Par&s;ons, or frightening old Women, with telling them the <HI>French</HI> were landed, and our Fleets beat, nor alarming the Country Towns at Mid|night, with crying Fire. It was indeed one of the highe&s;t Journies I ever tra|velled.</P>
<P>After we had been &s;ome Time keep|ing open Hou&s;e, the Country Gentle|men came forty Miles round to &s;ee and
<PB N="192" REF="197">hear me. I began to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to my Friend, for I could drink when he could not, and &s;ing; he knew no Songs, and tell Stories, and he had no Humour; that at la&s;t he &s;wore to me, as we &s;at over the Remains of a Bowl of Arrack, every one el&s;e had left us (it was about four o'Clock in the Morning) he &s;wore he would &s;ettle two hundred Pounds a Year upon me for Life, and make a Point of it; he &s;wore, &s;queezing me heartily by the Hand at the &s;ame Time, that I was the clevere&s;t Fellow in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and &s;hould live independantly.</P>
<P>But I was out of Luck, for it was but next Evening I gave Judgment again&s;t my Friend and Patron that was to be, about his holding a foul Card. He did hold it, to be &s;ure, and I was half fuddled, and &s;aid he did; immediately he flung a Bottle at my Head, and or|dered his Servants to turn me out of Doors. About four in the Morning I was &s;et adrift, without a &s;ingle Penny in my Pocket, or knowing where to rai&s;e one.</P>
<P>However, I came to a Re&s;olution to earn the Bread I &s;hould eat for the future, and let it be ever &s;o mean an Employ, I was re&s;olved to &s;eek for a Livelihood. There were &s;everal Ways that I could
<PB N="193" REF="198">maintain my&s;elf in, for 'tis a very vul|gar Error to &s;ay, a Gentleman is not brought up to any Thing.</P>
<P>I was qualified as Coachman, or Cock-feeder, or a Game-keeper, or a Whipper-in, or a riding Groom, but I could not get Bu&s;ine&s;s in any of tho&s;e Employments; becau&s;e tho&s;e to whom I proffered my&s;elf, objected to my being a Gentleman, and I had no Body could give me a Character; at la&s;t, after hav|ing put my&s;elf into a proper Dre&s;s, I got my&s;elf hired to make Hay.</P>
<P>In a Week's Time, I found a won|derful Alteration in my&s;elf for the better, in Re&s;pect of Health and Quiet. I fell a&s;leep when Night came, without being obliged fir&s;t to get drunk by way of Opiate; I waked next Morning neither &s;ick, &s;orry, nor a&s;hamed, by the bitter Remembrance of how much like a Mad|man I had behaved over Night. I &s;oon lo&s;t a Hoar&s;ene&s;s which long had plagued me. My Legs fell into their proper Shape, my Wind was mended, my Eyes cea&s;ed &s;marting, my Hands were &s;teady at Breakfa&s;t Time, my Fle&s;h grew firm, and I wanted no Wine and Bitters to make me eat my Dinner.</P>
<P>Thus I liv'd, Sir, for a whole Twelve|month, employed in one Part or other
<PB N="194" REF="199">of Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, till Providence con|ducted me to this Hou&s;e; it was fitting up for this Gentlewoman, I was Over|&s;eer of the Workmen, and &s;ince I am employed for her. Here we live retired, we have every Thing we wi&s;h for among our&s;elves; we have &s;een the World, and de&s;pi&s;e, heartily de&s;pi&s;e its Vices and Fol|lies, and would not again be intoxicated with them, for more than ever we were formerly worth; no, not all the Pains and Penalties of the Inqui&s;ition could ever pu&s;h me into the &s;ame Path again.</P>
<P>Thus Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> entertained Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> binding with &s;everal Oaths, his Di&s;approbation of every Irregularity, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him ever again to run into the &s;ame Errors. Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> took Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> to be indeed re|formed; nay, Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> believed him|&s;elf to be &s;o&mdash;Who would not?&mdash;But alas, How can we pretend to know and read Mankind, when we are Strangers to our&s;elves? At lea&s;t, this was Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI>'s Ca&s;e; for tho' he promi&s;ed and vowed &s;o ardently again&s;t late Hours, bad Company and many Bumpers, it is not above &s;even to four, or &s;even and a half to four at mo&s;t, but if he had the &s;ame Opportunities, Abilities and Temp|tations,
<PB N="195" REF="200">he would do the &s;ame Things, he had done.</P>
<P>Reader, be not in Wrath that our Characters are not compleatly good, ei|ther after Marriage, or Repentance. We endeavour to exhibit Life, not ac|cording to our Wi&s;hes, but Ob&s;erva|tions; and as we copy from Nature, mu&s;t do as Nature has done. Only let me beg of thee to ob&s;erve the ingenious Exhibitions of Mr. <HI>Hogarth;</HI> who is among Painters what Dean <HI>Swift</HI> was among Poets. His Performances mu&s;t plea&s;e thee, according to the Abilities thou ha&s;t to be plea&s;ed.&mdash;Yet &s;eldom doth he pre&s;ent us with perfect Beauties in his Figures, the Rea&s;on is obvious; like <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> he is one of Nature's Agents, and therefore mu&s;t act accord|ing to her Commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the anatomical Figures made by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Deno&uuml;e</HI> (which were not good enough for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Collection) every Part of Nature is laid open; he aimed not to flatter, but in&s;truct. Some Things indeed might &s;hock his Pupils, but they were Truths they ought to be acquaint|ed with.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Mr. <HI>Borlace</HI> had ended his Story, the younge&s;t of the Ladies, turning to <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> thus be|gan her's.</P>
<P>My Father, Sir, was a Baronet, his Name Sir <HI>Philpot Fool.</HI>&mdash;We mu&s;t leave it entirely to the Reader's Imagina|tion, to form an ideal Picture of her Bro|ther's A&s;toni&s;hment. He ran to her, threw his Arms about her Neck, and as well, and fa&s;t as the Joy of &s;uch a Meeting would allow him to be articulate, he di&s;covered him&s;elf to her. The re&s;t of the Day was &s;pent in hearing every particular Tran&s;action of his Life, from his Ad|mittance into Lady <HI>Grotto</HI>'s Hou&s;e, to his Delivery from the Stone Pit.</P>
<P>Next Morning the two Ladies begg'd Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Company into their Dre&s;&s;ing-room. As &s;oon as they were all &s;eated, the elde&s;t Gentlewoman, to prepare the Brother to receive calmly a Relation of his Si&s;ter's Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, began by way of Preamble, to ob&s;erve the va&s;t Force of Pa&s;&s;ion; how much Inclination was &s;tronger than Rea&s;on, and that Wo|man's Will was like a Whirlwind.&mdash;
<PB N="197" REF="202">Then hinted about Heat of Blood, Pre|judice of Education, Hurry of Youth, Deceit of Mankind, and all the other la|mentable Topics, &s;o copiou&s;ly declaimed upon by tho&s;e who do err, and tho&s;e who pretend to &s;ay they do not.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool</HI> interrupted the Speaker, by taking hold of his Si&s;ter's Hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it tenderly betwixt both his, with the utmo&s;t Affection in his Face. He replied, my dear Girl, do not con|ceal the Truth from your Brother, your Brother is your Friend: My dear, God forbid I &s;hou'd hold you hard in my E&s;teem, &s;ince I have been &s;o culpable my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Ninny<HI>'s Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on, my dear Brother, that Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> took no Notice of you, after your being &s;ome Time at School, was owing to a great Quarrel between him and my Mama.</P>
<P>A Greyhound, which was a great Fa|vourite of my Papa's, kill'd her Lady|&s;hip's <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Phea&s;ant. My Mama made the Shepherd's Boy &s;hoot the Hound directly; but the Moment Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> heard of it, he &s;natch'd her green
<PB N="198" REF="203">Parrot off his Perch, and with his own Hands wrung the Head off.</P>
<P>My Mama, Brother, had a Spirit be|coming a Woman of Quality.&mdash;A noble Spirit indeed;&mdash;&s;he never wou'd forgive an In&s;ult; but her Revenge &s;he wou'd have, let the Con&s;equence be what it wou'd; and I own my&s;elf &s;o much of her Mind, that altho' I have &s;ometimes &s;uffer'd for it, I wou'd &s;how a proper Re&s;entment;&mdash;ay, and will, tho' I was &s;ure to lo&s;e my Life by it.</P>
<P>When her Lady&s;hip &s;aw her Parrot murder'd, &s;he flew into the Picture Gal|lery, and cut Holes in all the fine Paint|ings; which when Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> &s;aw, he bur&s;t open her <HI>China</HI> Clo&s;et-door, and broke every Thing to &s;ma&s;h in it: This was a terrible Stroke; this my Mama cou'd not bear, &s;he fell into violent Hy|&s;terics; and on the In&s;tant &s;he was able to crawl, knowing you to be Papa's Favourite, &s;he made an Affidavit that you were a Ba&s;tard.</P>
<P>This Action &s;tupified Sir <HI>Philpot;</HI> for three or four Days afterwards he &s;poke to no body, but &s;at in his own Room like a Man moped; and on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, it makes me &s;hudder, when I think on't, Papa &s;hot him&s;elf thro' the Head; but what was the cruelle&s;t of all,
<PB N="199" REF="204">he carried his Re&s;entment beyond the Grave; for he &s;ent a long Letter to his particular Friend, about half an Hour before he committed the Fact, wherein he gave his Rea&s;ons for what he was about to do, and begg'd the Gentleman, by their long Intimacy, and as he regarded the Words of his dying Friend, that he wou'd make that Letter Public, and by that prove he was not Lunatic when he kill'd him&s;elf, &s;o that his Family &s;hou'd not inherit the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, to whom the Letter was &s;ent, liv'd about twenty Miles off, and he and Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> had been School|fellows together, and no two were ever more intimate; but the Gentleman was generous enough to &s;how this Letter to my Mama, and me, no body el&s;e. He was a Coun&s;ellor at Law; and begg'd her Lady&s;hip not to be unea&s;y, he wou'd take Care of every Thing for her.</P>
<P>How the Affairs were managed, I cant' tell. I &s;uppo&s;e there are &s;ome par|ticular Methods in the Law, which, when People know how to make u&s;e of, they need not fear any Thing, at lea&s;t I heard the Coun&s;ellor tell her Lady&s;hip &s;o. Sir <HI>Philpot</HI>'s Letter, in&s;tead of being pub|li&s;hed, was burn'd. And when the Co|roner
<PB N="200" REF="205">came, he was a mighty civil Man, and brought in a proper Verdict, by which we &s;aved the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Brother, you may wonder, that after my Mama had got clear of tho&s;e Difficulties, &s;omething was not done for you; but really Lady <HI>Philpot</HI> at fir&s;t would not hear a Word of Family Affairs; becau&s;e, as her Lady&s;hip ob|&s;erv'd, they put her too much in Mind of the late unhappy Accident. And as &s;he was, and you mu&s;t remember, Bro|ther, a very fine Woman, &s;he was &s;ur|rounded with Acquaintance. And to di&s;&s;ipate her Grief, &s;he was hurried into &s;o much Company, that we had not a Moment to our&s;elves, or for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>For really, Brother, People of Fa&s;hion have more fatiguing Lives, than the lower Set of Mortals wou'd believe. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction I mean, who are willing to appear as &s;uch; for what with receiving and returning Vi&s;its, Auction Day's, Dre&s;&s;ing and Undre&s;&s;ing, Opera Nights, Routs, A&s;&s;emblies, Break|fa&s;tings, Plays, Airing in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> and <HI>Vauxhall,</HI> Parties once or twice in the Sea&s;ons, I do a&s;&s;ure you, we are in a continual Flutter of Di&s;&s;ipations; and it mu&s;t therefore be expected that fine Women, in&s;tead of thinking about

<P>But now, Brother, I am to claim the Forgivene&s;s you have promi&s;ed me: I &s;hall faithfully relate Matters of Fact, ju&s;t as they happened. I was barely Sixteen when we appear'd Abroad again; and Lady <HI>Philpot,</HI> contrary to other Parents, was pleas'd to carry me every where with her: But how unhappy are the young Part of our Sex; who are &s;hown into Life unaccompanied with a proper Guide, our Minds tainted in&s;en&s;ibly by our In|timates.&mdash;I am &s;ure however that mine was.</P>
<P>After Dinner, when the Ladies are withdrawn, Gentlemen, as I've been told, over their Bottle, often conver&s;e toge|ther very loo&s;ely. Our Sex, I a&s;&s;ure you, at &s;ometimes, are not much behind Hand with yours, as to the Topics of their Di&s;cour&s;e; only we are, I fancy, more delicate in our Phra&s;es.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome very intimate Acquain|tances, Ladies, who were rather older than my&s;elf, but were full as &s;prightly; and, to u&s;e their own Words, hated Pru|dery. From them I was in&s;tructed in &s;uch Things! My God! I have heard of People who&s;e Brains have been turn'd by Pride; one Pa&s;&s;ion will intoxicate the
<PB N="202" REF="207">Under&s;tanding as much as another; I was almo&s;t mad for Enjoyment; to &s;uch a Pitch I had heighten'd my Ima|gination.</P>
<P>I cou'd think, talk, or hear of no|thing el&s;e; and only the Fear of being refus'd, prevented me from a&s;king the fir&s;t Man I met the Que&s;tion; they had made me imagine it mu&s;t be all Ely&s;ium.</P>
<P>A Gentleman ju&s;t at this Time (one of our Neighbours in the Country) a&s;k'd my Mama's Con&s;ent to pay his Ad|dre&s;&s;es to me. Upon his bare Promi&s;e of Marriage, which I only took to &s;ave Appearances, I admitted him to &s;tay all Night with me in my Bedchamber; there I gave my&s;elf up to all tho&s;e pro|mis'd Toys, dying Murmers, and &s;wim|ming Exta&s;ies I had &s;o long and &s;o fondly fancied.</P>
<P>But Enjoyment an&s;wer'd not at all the Idea which I had entertain'd of it. Next Morning I hone&s;tly declar'd &s;o to my Lover:&mdash;Confe&s;s'd to him, that it was Curio&s;ity which had engag'd me in In|trigue; that I expected to have met with more than I cou'd expre&s;s to him;&mdash;but I found my&s;elf horridly di&s;appointed; it was to me the mo&s;t momentary of all Gratifications, no &s;ooner felt than fled,

<P>My Gallant &s;eem'd a&s;toni&s;h'd, and af|ter he had recover'd him&s;elf, as brutal and gro&s;s enough to tell me in his Reply, I was the only Woman who had ever found Fault with his Abilities; had I been a Man, I cou'd have fell'd him to my Foot, for the mean Opinion he had of me. I contented my&s;elf with cooly replying to him, it was not the Actor, but the Deed which I di&s;liked; and prote&s;ted I never more wou'd engage in any &s;uch Affair. From thenceforth for &s;ome Time never thought any more about it, except it was to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who extoll'd it as the ultimate of human Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Still this Gentleman per&s;i&s;ted in my granting him the &s;ame Favours as I had done; I wou'd not, he grew ten Times more importunate; I was oblig'd at la&s;t to beg my Mama wou'd forbid him the Hou&s;e; &s;he did &s;o, and added it was done at my Reque&s;t. This &s;o far piqu'd him, that he immediately related to her what had pa&s;s'd betwixt us; and not contented with that, went to the Tavern, and among all his Acquaintance told all I had granted him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="209">It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe the Rage I was in; my Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o vio|lent it threw me into a Fever; but my Hope of Revenge contributed more than the Phy&s;ician to my Recovery. When I was ju&s;t able to walk out, a Gentleman, who lived in the next Hou&s;e to Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s, met me as I was taking the Air: He acco&s;ted me with the utmo&s;t Re|&s;pect, &s;poke with much Warmth again&s;t the Villainies of the Age we liv'd in, particularis'd the &s;everal Follies his Sex were guilty of, and dwelt a long Time on the wicked Vanity of tho&s;e Cox|combs, who, as <HI>Horatio</HI> &s;aid, fancied Raptures that they never knew; and I was charm'd to hear him.

<P>By this Time we had reach'd our Hou&s;e; I begg'd he'd alight and walk in with me.

<P>A Letter I happened to find in my Room, which dropp'd out of the Con|federate's Pocket, open'd the whole Plot to me.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Conclu&s;ion of Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI>'s Hi&s;tory,</HEAD>
<P>THERE came down at this Time, upon a Party of Plea&s;ure, with &s;ome more Gentlemen, a Colonel of Hor&s;e. It was always cu&s;tomary for every Stranger to be invited to Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s; for my Mama was exce&s;&s;ively fond of Vi&s;itors. This Officer bore the be&s;t of Characters, and his Behaviour was &s;o very engaging, that every body court|ed his Company. Lady <HI>Philpot,</HI> I found, was very particular in her Behaviour to him, and he &s;eem'd to tell me by Eyes, he had rather have half &s;uch Civilities from me.</P>
<P>Both Villains were now in Town, for the Week following there was to be the Races. I cou'd not &s;leep, to think how ba&s;ely I had been abu&s;ed, and had yet found no Way to redre&s;s my&s;elf. After &s;ome Time deliberating, I re&s;olv'd to apply to the Officer I ju&s;t now men|tion'd. I ingenuou&s;ly related to him my whole Story, and begg'd his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="214">The two, who had u&s;ed me &s;o ba&s;ely, were Men of great Fortune; it was therefore not any way a le&s;&s;ening to his Character, for him to call them to an Account. He gave me his Honour he wou'd do it; and the fir&s;t Day in the Race Week, at the Ordinary, he forc'd my fir&s;t Lover to confe&s;s publickly, that every Thing which he had &s;aid of me was purely Invention, acknowledg'd him&s;elf to be a Ra&s;cal, and was u&s;her'd down Stairs accordingly.</P>
<P>My &s;econd Gallant, who had that Morning in the Cockpit expos'd a <HI>Cy|pre&s;s</HI> Handkerchief, which he took off my Dre&s;&s;ing-table; but had told every body I had given it him, was &s;tealing away on Tip-toe, after he had been a Witne&s;s to the Di&s;grace of his Friend; but the Colonel, who had an Eye upon him, &s;tepping betwixt him and the Door, &s;topp'd him; &s;aying at the &s;ame time to him, calling him by his Name; and you, Sir, who pretend to di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elf by the Title of a Gentleman, Where is the Trophy you have gloried in &s;o this Morning? Here, here, my dear Cap|tain, reply'd the other, and trembling held out the Handkerchief to him; and who, &s;ays the Colonel, when he received it, looking my Gallant &s;tedfa&s;tly in the
<PB N="210" REF="215">Face, who gave you this Favour do you &s;ay, Sir? No, no, no body pon my Soul Colonel, I found it in the A&s;&s;embly-room la&s;t Night; that was his An&s;wer.</P>
<P>A Laugh eccho'd round the Room, and the Colonel ordering the Door-way to be clear'd, &s;ent him out with the &s;ame Orders his Companion had receiv'd. This News was brought Home to me immediately; and I hope my Brother won't give me up entirely to Cen&s;ure, if I confe&s;s I did not long he&s;itate how I &s;hou'd reward my Hero. I was always violent in what I re&s;olv'd upon, eager to indulge the Re&s;entment, regardle&s;s of the future, and what I once intended to gratify, I was ever re&s;olute to ac|compli&s;h.</P>

<P>I never knew it otherways with young Per&s;ons who had Pa&s;&s;ions; but Lord help me, I have been a long while out of the World, for I have lately heard a Gentleman &s;ay, that there are a Set of very gay-dre&s;s'd Figures of both Sexes about the Town now, who &s;eem entirely dive&s;ted of all Pa&s;&s;ions, and yet they have all the Marks of Liveline&s;s about them: They look without Expre&s;&s;ion, they talk without Meaning, and li&s;ten without Under&s;tanding; they move me|chanically,
<PB N="211" REF="216">meer Machines, like Show-images, for Taylors and Milliners to di&s;|play their Workman&s;hip upon; he call'd them Expletives in Society, and com|par'd them to Weeds in Blo&s;&s;om.</P>

<P>Lady <HI>Fool</HI> one Day &s;urpriz'd the Co|lonel along with me, and from that Time began to treat me with va&s;t Severity. The Coun&s;ellor, my Mama's Friend, got all our E&s;tate into his Hands; by one Means or other per&s;uaded my Mamma to &s;ign fir&s;t one Parchment, and then another; on purpo&s;e, as my Lady thought, to prevent me from having any Share in it; for it is incredible to how va&s;t a Height her Hate was carried a|gain&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Colonel was commanded into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he was kill'd. Lady <HI>Philpot</HI> &s;oon after broke up Hou&s;e-keep|ing, and went to the Coun&s;ellor's; and I with a little Pocket-money, went to board at my Maid's Mother's. Lady <HI>Philpot</HI> declar'd, I mu&s;t never pre&s;ume to expect any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from her.</P>
<P>I was at a &s;mall Farm-hou&s;e, where the good People who liv'd in it, thought they never cou'd do enough for me. I had indeed always been very kind to their Daughter: So you &s;ee, Brother,
<PB N="212" REF="217">tho' Gratitude is not to be found in fine Hou&s;es, it may &s;ometimes be met with under a thatch'd Roof. I had not been in this Retirement above a Fortnight, before their only Son came to &s;ee them from <HI>London.</HI> As &s;oon as he had a Sight of me, he &s;wore there was not &s;uch a fine Figure upon the Town. I did not under&s;tand the Meaning of his Speech, but I wi&s;h'd (as he was a well-looking young Man, and talk'd much of the Money he got, and the fine Company he kept) my Per&s;on cou'd win &s;o far upon him, that he wou'd make me his Wife.</P>
<P>There was nothing I hope wicked in the Wi&s;h. I was drove almo&s;t to De&s;pair, and the only Con&s;olation I had was, in now and then reflecting how ju&s;tly the two Villains had been puni&s;h'd, who betray'd me. After my Maid's Brother had been in the Country with us for three Weeks, he paid his Addre&s;&s;es to me, and prof|fer'd to marry me. The Time had been, when &s;uch a Propo&s;al wou'd have been an&s;wer'd by a Hor&s;e-pond-ducking. But now, what cou'd I do? Oh, Brother, if there is one State on Earth more mi&s;e|rable than another, it is that of a Per&s;on of Fa&s;hion fallen to Decay. We were
<PB N="213" REF="218">lawfully married at the Pari&s;h Church, and next Week we went up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t I was a little chagrin'd to find my Spou&s;e was only a Waiter at a noted Tavern in <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> and all the Noble|men he boa&s;ted of being &s;o intimate with, always when he &s;poke of them, calling them by their Chri&s;tian Names of <HI>Dick, Harry, Tom, Will, George,</HI> and &s;o on, were his Ma&s;ter's Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>However, he hired me very genteel Lodgings, and took me to all public Places, and often urg'd me to dre&s;s in a more gaudy &s;howey Way than I had been u&s;ed to, in&s;i&s;ting to me it was all Mode: But I, who had really been brought up as a Gentlewoman ought, cou'd &s;oon &s;ee the Difference between what was really elegant, and the Affectation of it. Con|tinually was my Spou&s;e prai&s;ing one Man of Title or another to me, for their Wealth and Genero&s;ity; and telling me, as &s;oon as they came to Town, he &s;hou'd bring them to &s;ee me. This Di&s;cour&s;e at fir&s;t I cou'd not readily comprehend: However, at la&s;t I made &s;hift to find out, that he married me only to make a Property of me, and like the Wine he bottled, &s;erve me up to &s;ome of his Men of Quality.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="219">In a few Days, he brought Home a very gay-dre&s;s'd and very polite Gentle|man, and left us together. I am not very patient under a trifling Injury, but &s;uch an Affront as this, was much more than I cou'd bear. I bur&s;t into Tears; the Gentleman my Vi&s;itor &s;eem'd much &s;urpri&s;ed, made me many Apolo|gies, and took his Leave of me very gen|teely, promi&s;ing me his Protection.</P>
<P>When my&mdash;, I don't know what to call him, came Home; there is not in Language a Name ba&s;e enough to call him by, who wou'd &s;ell his Wife. When he heard how coldly I had be|hav'd to this his Patron, as he call'd him, he beat me, lock'd me into a Gar|ret, fed me for a Week upon only Bread and Water, and threaten'd to have me confin'd in Mad-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But this Behaviour he found was lo&s;t upon me; I inherited too much of my Mama's Temper, to &s;ubmit to &s;uch U|&s;age. He then tried gentler Methods with me; at la&s;t let me live as I pleas'd, only I was now and then oblig'd to bear a Vi&s;it from the Gentleman he fir&s;t in|troduc'd to me. I did neither fret in|wardly, or &s;how any Signs of Di&s;like, either by my Behaviour or Conver&s;ation. Indeed I was determin'd to be reveng'd,
<PB N="215" REF="220">not only upon the Wretch to whom I had given my Hand, but al&s;o upon this Patron; he I re&s;olv'd &s;hou'd take a Share in my Re&s;entment: For this very Per|&s;on, the Man of great Rank, and con|&s;equently of great Honour, had been privy, as I accidentally di&s;cover'd, to all the cruel Treatment I had receiv'd from my Barbarian. They, according to the Game&s;ter's Phra&s;e, play'd into each o|ther's Hands, ju&s;t to make a poor help|le&s;s Woman their Bubble. Was it not right then think you in me, if I endea|vour'd to turn the Tables upon them?</P>
<P>The Per&s;on whom I have &s;o often mention'd, that profe&s;s'd him&s;elf &s;o &s;tre|nuou&s;ly my Admirer, was a married Man. I went to his Lady, related my Story to her, and begg'd her Pro|tection. Whether in telling my Story, I made her or her Hu&s;band look Little, I can't tell; but after having ey'd me from Head to Foot, before &s;he &s;poke, her Face fill'd with Di&s;dain, &s;he replied, that &s;he wonder'd immen&s;ely at my Im|pertinence, how I dared to have the Va|nity to be &s;o horribly ab&s;urd, a to ima|gine HER Spou&s;e, a Man of HIS Ta&s;te, wou'd have any thing to &s;ay to &s;uch a Fright, to &s;uch a vulgar Creature as I was, and charg'd me never to dare to
<PB N="216" REF="221">under her Roof again, upon Pain of be|ing committed to <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>How I got Home, I can hardly de|&s;cribe; my Limbs trembled with Pa&s;|&s;ion, I was in &s;uch an Agony, my Speech fail'd me.&mdash;But luckily recollecting I had Revenge in my Power, I &s;oon came to my&s;elf. My Wretch was gone to his Drawer&s;hip's Bu&s;ine&s;s; I di&s;patch'd a Card to the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e, to the very Gentleman I had ju&s;t been complaining or to his Lady. He came immediately, I told him, that as he had often promis'd me his Protection, I had taken the Liberty now to demand it. He enquired in what manner he cou'd be&s;t &s;erve me: I replied, my Hu&s;band was hateful to me, as indeed he was, and till I was releas'd from &s;uch a Wretch, I wou'd never let any Man &s;ee my Face, but hide my&s;elf down in the Country, where it &s;hou'd be impo&s;&s;ible to find me.</P>
<P>The Villain, to whom I had been married, was immediately &s;ent for; Ar|ticles of Separation were immediately drawn: He was immediately oblig'd to &s;ign them; tho' he fell on his Knees, wrung his Hands, begg'd me for God's Sake not to part from him. Had he be|hav'd to me but like a Man, the World &s;hould not have parted us, but I remem|bered
<PB N="217" REF="222">the U&s;age I had received from him. Re&s;entment kept me &s;ilent; and altho' it was but a mean Revenge, I con|fe&s;s, I enjoy'd the Anxiety he endur'd, and left him without &s;o much as &s;aying Adieu, and found my&s;elf once more a free Woman, in very elegant-furni&s;h'd Lodgings at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I took Care to let the Lady, who had &s;o &s;cornfully threatned me, &s;ee by my Dre&s;s and Equipage, that &s;o vulgar a Creature as me, cou'd be taken Notice of. I was re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hou'd know al&s;o who it was that &s;upported me in &s;uch Splendor; it was that on which I de|pended, to compleat my Triumph over her. As &s;oon as &s;he cou'd be convinc'd I was maintain'd by her Hu&s;band, all her Haughtine&s;s vani&s;h'd. She &s;ent her own Brother to me, with a Propo&s;ition to this effect: That if I wou'd break off my Connection with her Spou&s;e, I &s;hou'd have an Annuity of fifty Pounds a Year &s;ettled upon me, and a hundred Guineas down.</P>
<P>The Situation this Gentleman de&s;cribed his Si&s;ter to be in, the happy Life they had always lived before, and the Di&s;trac|tions which were like to en&s;ue betwixt two noble Families, determined me to
<PB N="218" REF="223">con&s;ent to a final Separation; nay, I did more, for by my Means a thorough Reconciliation was made between the Gentleman who I had parted from, and his Spou&s;e. He has ever &s;ince been one of the mo&s;t indulgent Hu&s;bands; and at his Lady's De&s;ire, as a Te&s;timony of her Opinion of me, has enlarg'd my annual Pen&s;ion to four&s;core Pounds a Year.</P>

<P>I once was mantain'd by a Per&s;on whom the World call'd a great Man. He &s;eem'd to be very fond of me, but his De&s;ires, were indelicate, irregular, and &s;ometimes prepo&s;terous. He was pro|fu&s;e in his Expences upon me, and rav|ing if I ever appear'd what he call'd in|different to his Favours. Yet he had one of the be&s;t, and one of the fine&s;t Women in the World for his Spou&s;e, and four as fine Children; all which he de&s;pis'd, for the empty O&s;tentation of being thought the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a Woman, whom Hundreds had had before him. You &s;ee, Sir, I'm as ingenuous as your Si&s;ter in my Account of my&s;elf. I de&s;pis'd him in my Heart for the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his Ta&s;te, in wa&s;ting Time, Fortune, and Reputation, upon me; who was unworthy to be Scullion to the Lady he abandon'd.</P>
<P>However, his Money was of Service to me, and Women of the Town, like any other Trades-people, are not to quar|rel with their be&s;t Cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>I, like a Frontier Town in Time of War, often changed my Ma&s;ters. The next Per&s;on who own'd me, was a Being, whom I cou'd, properly cla&s;s under no
<PB N="222" REF="227">Character; he call'd him&s;elf a Jemmy, had a very fine E&s;tate, was very lavi&s;h of it, in buying Nick-nacks, altering his Furniture, Harne&s;s, Po&s;t Charriots, and Taverns. Jaunting with me from Inn to Inn, leaving me no other Socie|ty than the Landlady, or the melancho|ly Amu&s;ement of looking thro' the Sa&s;hes, at the Carriages, and Travellers that came in and out of the Place where we happened to be. He was always boa&s;t|ing of the many fine Women he had enjoy'd; nor wou'd he let a Lady of Quality e&s;cape him; indeed he took Care where he told his Story. It was only to the Landlord's Family, who, like other Dependants, were obliged to be &s;ilent, and &s;eem to believe whatever their Pa|tron was plea&s;ed to tell them. For my Part, I believe he was Innocency it&s;elf; for in the &s;ix Months of our dawdling together, I was a We&s;tal to him; he conver&s;ed with me as guiltle&s;s as my Bro|ther. But with his all Vanity, and throw|ing away his Money, he never wou'd allow me Six-pence in my Pocket. This I cou'd not bear, and only &s;taid with him till I cou'd fix upon a better Chap|man.</P>
<P>I was recommended to a Man of great Ta&s;te, that was the Character giv|en
<PB N="223" REF="228">me of him, very rich, but very ugly, As to his Per&s;on, Women of our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion have no Bu&s;ine&s;s to mind Out|&s;ides. Kept Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es have no more to do with real Love, than Bailies have with Compa&s;&s;ion. I liv'd with him in much Splendor, and great Unea&s;ine&s;s, fooli&s;hly fond of me in Public, and in private continually thwarting me.</P>
<P>He was indeed, as they &s;aid, a Man of Ta&s;te, but of a very odd one; for, as he confe&s;&s;ed to me, Enjoyment was almo&s;t in&s;ipid to him. All his Plea&s;ure was, to be known, to be well with &s;ome very celebrated Lady of Plea&s;ure; and has &s;everal Times declared to me, that he wou'd not give Six-pence to lay with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Beauty, unle&s;s &s;he was a noted Pro&s;titute. He was all for publick Opinion; but that Opinion cou'd not make me doat upon him: 'Tis true, he was generous enough; nay, ra|ther pre&s;&s;ing me &s;ometimes to take Mo|ney; for I am not the mo&s;t mercenary of my Sex; but I cou'd not like him; and as he really &s;aid, he proved too, that Enjoyment was very in&s;ipid with him, nay, rather fatiguing and di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e gentlemen, who are plea&s;ed to make what Remarks they think fit on our Sex, declare, that a Woman's
<PB N="224" REF="229">Per&s;on is the be&s;t Part of the Plea&s;ure; if her Mind or Inclination is not at all concern'd in the Agreement, the Gallant, whatever he may fancy of the Fea&s;t, has but an indifferent Share on it. I cou'd not entirely dive&s;t my&s;elf while he liv'd of all Acquaintance with him; for after we parted, at all public Places he wou'd haunt me like my Shadow, till I com|promi&s;ed Affairs with him: He was to allow me five Guineas a Weak, upon Condition I walk'd with him at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> wou'd let him drive me to <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> Races, call of him in a Chair three Mornings in the Week at the <HI>Smyrna, Slaughter</HI>'s, and the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee-hou&s;es, and once a Week, in the Sea&s;on, &s;up with him in <HI>Vauxhall</HI> Gardens under the Orche&s;tra, while the Mu&s;ick play'd.</P>
<P>This Agreement I inform'd the Gen|tleman of, with whom I went next to live; but he was too carele&s;s a Creature I found, to concern him&s;elf about our Sex; he told me, that he kept me mere|ly for an Amu&s;ement, he lik'd my Fi|gure and Conver&s;ation; but all he did for me was to plea&s;e him&s;elf; that a Man of Sen&s;e cou'd not be jealous of a Woman of the Town; as to my Time, I was very welcome to do what I wou'd
<PB N="225" REF="230">with it when he did not want me, pro|vided I was careful of my Health.</P>
<P>This &s;trange Negligence of his made a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on me than all the A&s;&s;iduities I had receiv'd from others; cou'd he now and then, or wou'd he now and then, have behav'd but commonly civil to me, I &s;hou'd have doated on him; but he was quite a <HI>Hottentot,</HI> he never had an amiable Moment. There is a Time when Tenderne&s;s takes Place of Riot, and even Savagene&s;s it&s;elf is &s;oftened; but 'twas not &s;o with him; he was al Hurly-burly. When I have artle&s;sly indeed expre&s;s'd my&s;elf fondly; &s;omething like Love for a Minute &s;teal|ing over my Sen&s;es, he has interrupted my Indulgence, with p&s;hah, don't think to make a Fool of me,&mdash;Hum, Boys and old Men, &s;uch as I am, are not to be caught with Chaff.</P>
<P>I quitted him for a famous Fox-hunt|er, the fine&s;t Fellow in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o every body told me he was; tho' a great Lump of Tobacco, which &s;well'd out his lower Lip, the fir&s;t Time he &s;aluted me, gave me no great Opinion of his Delicacy. However, I accepted of him, and my Acquaintance congratulated me upon my Luck, in having &s;o accom|pli&s;hed a Lover, a Man of &s;uch fine
<PB N="226" REF="231">Sen&s;e; &s;uch he might have, I believe, when &s;ober, and a great many other princely Qualities; but I liv'd with him a Month, and he was continually fuddled; I part|ed from him-fearful of my Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The next Day after I had left my la&s;t Lover, I chanced to get acquainted with one, who was really a clever Fellow; but then he had not Six-pence; that I did not then mind, I had enough, and I re&s;olv'd, &s;ince for &s;ome Time I had been a Slave to Man's various Inclinati|ons, I wou'd make one of that Sex &s;ub|ject to mine; and after &s;o much Labour, re&s;olv'd to have &s;ome Holidays.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t three or four Days that I had this Genius with me, he was the mo&s;t entertaining Per&s;on I had ever kept Company with. But he &s;oon grew out of Temper, he wanted to be in the wide World again; not contented to be with me, and have every Thing elegant about him&mdash;no&mdash;he wanted a Ramble: Regularity to him was a <HI>Barbary</HI> Slave|ry. I found him too witty to have any Sen&s;e. There was no more fixing him than Smoke. Yet I was &s;o bigotted to him, that I offer'd to &s;ell my fine Fur|niture, retire into the Country, marry him, and live hone&s;t, I &s;hall never forget his An&s;wer. No, Madam (he
<PB N="227" REF="232">reply'd) there's an Act of Parliament again&s;t Monopolies. You belong to the Public, and I have too great a Regard to my Country, to pretend to keep that for my own U&s;e, which, like the New River, has and ought to &s;erve half the Town. Be&s;ides, &s;hou'd &s;uch a Thing happen, I mu&s;t bani&s;h my&s;elf from my own Sex's Society; &s;ince I never cou'd meet too Acquaintance, but I mu&s;t be very certain one of them, at lea&s;t, had lain with my Wife.</P>
<P>I was mad with his Refu&s;al, yet I own I admired his Spirit. We parted in a Pett; and altho' we both, I be|lieve, wi&s;h'd to come together again, neither of us wou'd &s;peak fir&s;t. I never after that had the lea&s;t Affection for Mankind. On the contrary, they grew more and more di&s;agreeable to me; when a fooli&s;h Fellow of Fortune had me, his Behaviour made me loath him; when a jealous Man was my Ma&s;ter, my Furniture was always in Danger. A Sot impair'd my Health; a Wit ru|ined me; a Game&s;ter made a Slave of me; young Fellows fretted me; old Men fatigued me; and with a marry'd Man I was in continual Alarms.</P>
<P>I have in every Stage of Life found enough to make me mi&s;erable; and

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Evening <HI>Tom Fool</HI> told his Sifter the Re&s;olution he had made, to leave <HI>England;</HI> but this Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI> vehemently oppos'd, de&s;iring her Bro|ther not to revenge him&s;elf upon him|&s;elf; that all Ra&s;hne&s;s was ridiculous. Mrs. <HI>Veillied</HI> ob&s;erved, that the World was at &s;uch a Pa&s;s at pre&s;ent, that it was not worth any one's while to trouble their Heads about it. <HI>Borlace</HI> &s;wore, that a Gentleman of Sen&s;e &s;hou'd never let Pa&s;&s;ion get the better of his Rea&s;on; and that we ought well to weigh the Con|&s;equence of every Intention, before we committed it to Practice.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> promis'd to do, and gave his Word and Honour, that he wou'd not determine in a Hurry on what he had to do. However, he ob|&s;erved, as the next Day wou'd be <HI>Sun|day,</HI> and as he found him&s;elf &s;o well heal'd, he wou'd go to Church in the Morning, to give Thanks for his E&s;cape and Recovery.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Veilleid,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny,</HI> and <HI>Bor|lace,</HI> look's upon one another as if, they &s;aid, we fear the Gentleman's growing
<PB N="230" REF="237">light headed; they wou'd not contra|dict him, for fear of making him wor&s;e, &s;eem'd to approve his De&s;ign, but hinted it was Bed-time. After they had &s;een Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> to Bed, they returned to hold a Con&s;ultation together; they a|greed <HI>nem con,</HI> that his Sen&s;es were not perfectly &s;ound; and yet, replied Mrs. <HI>Veilleid,</HI> you &s;ee not one Ob&s;ervation I made at Supper e&s;caped him; he has certainly a deal of Penetration: And who cou'd behave better than he did, (replied Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI>) when he com|mended me &s;o, for the manner in which I had related my Story. Certainly, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Borlace,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> is a very fine Man, yet he is not the fir&s;t Gentleman of extraordinary Sen&s;e, who&s;e Head has by Sickne&s;s been turn'd awry: Be&s;ides, con&s;ider, he has only drank Water, Tea, and plain Gruel, ever &s;ince he came; his Blood mu&s;t con&s;equently be thin, and poor, and run cold, and make him fan|cy &s;trange Megrims. You &s;ee he began about Church; we mu&s;t not contradict him, but let him go; I hope it won't make him wor&s;e tho'.</P>
<P>It was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that <HI>Wit-wou'd,</HI> tho' it was Night, &s;hou'd have a Hor&s;e &s;addled immediately, and &s;et off to Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and let Lady <HI>Fool</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="238">know where her Spou&s;e was. Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI> wrote her Lady&s;hip a Letter; then the two Gentlewomen retired to re&s;t, and <HI>Botlace</HI> gallop'd away full of Spirits.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday Morning.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> went into the Church the in&s;tant the Doors were open'd; he had therefore Time enough to walk about according to Cu&s;tom, and amu&s;e him&s;elf by &s;taring at one odd Thing or another; as indeed there is in mo&s;t Places of Wor|&s;hip. As he &s;auntred about, he might gaze at the Ceiling, pore over the paint|ed Gla&s;s, or read the gold-letter'd Ac|count of the &s;everal celebrated Bene|factors.</P>
<P><HI>Imprimis.</HI> How a Squire left forty Shillings <HI>per Annum,</HI> for a yearly Sermon again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, to be preach'd on the Day the Mayor was cho&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> That his Honour left thirty-&s;ix Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> to the Ringers, for a Peal to be rung on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> How that the Lady of the Ma|nor left fifty Pounds to new Fringe the Pulpit Cloth, and line the Family Pew.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239"><HI>Item.</HI> That the Reverend Vicar of the Church left two hundred Pounds, to buy a new Set of cha&s;ed Plate for the Communion-table, and twenty Pounds for two Velvet Cu&s;hions, with Gold Ta&s;&s;els.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> The &s;ame Reverend Gentleman left twelve Shillings <HI>per Annum,</HI> to be divided among twenty-four poor Hou&s;e-keepers on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Dame <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> is Wife, left ten Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for ever, to new gild yearly, the Iron Rails round her Tomb.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal other Benefactions, equally as devout, e&s;&s;ential, and charita|ble. But Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> took no Notice of any of the&s;e Things; it was odd indeed; but he did not &s;o much as tran&s;cribe one Epitaph, to communicate it to the Public for a Curio&s;ity, either for the Goodne&s;s of its Puns, or the Badne&s;s of its Spelling.</P>
<P>While he was at Church, a religious Awe fill'd his Mind, which made him &s;olely intent upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s he came about.</P>
<P>Oh, re&s;entful Reader, whether you are a polite Per&s;on, or a witty one, de&s;pi&s;e not the Hero of this Hi&s;tory, for being &s;o horridly out of Fa&s;hion, as to be at
<PB N="233" REF="240">Church from a Principle of unfeign'd Devotion.&mdash;Remember he is but a Fool.</P>
<P>Thou and I, and the re&s;t of the joyous Cla&s;s of choice Spirits, have too much Sen&s;e to &s;uffer our&s;elves &s;o to be impos'd upon.</P>
<P>When Morning-prayer was over; for it was not this Pari&s;h's Turn to have a Sermon every <HI>Sunday,</HI> altho' the Living was worth above a hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and held in <HI>Commendam</HI> with three more Pluralities, by the Reverend Mr. ****, Prebend of ****, and Chap|lain to ****; yet the Incumbent was &s;o frugal in Church Affairs, that he hired a Cantab. out of Preferment, at ten Shil|lings per Sabbath, to do Duty for him at all his inferior Spiritualities; &s;o that the Deputy was oblig'd to hurry over the Job, having no le&s;s than four more Churches to read Prayers and Sermons at, that very Day.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool</HI> chearfully walk'd through the Church-yard, with a Mind fill'd with that heaven-be&s;tow'd Tranquility, which always accompany true Devotion; and as he look'd on the lovely Land&s;capes around him, gratefully contemplated the Wonders of Creation.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="241">So much was he bu&s;ied in Mediation, he mi&s;took his Road; being a Stranger to the Country, he walk'd until he came to four Roads; then look'd round for the Church he came from, and re&s;olv'd to make up to it again, thinking from hence he cou'd hit upon the right Path; but like many wi&s;er Men, only took much Pains to be more out of the Way. He grew tired, and under a wide-branching Oak, in the mid&s;t of a &s;mooth-mown Gra&s;s-plat, he &s;at down: The Fa|tigue he had undergone made him drowzy; and laying at his Length, gave him&s;elf up to the gentle Indulgence of &s;trength-recruiting Sleep; fa&s;t as the Ale-drinking Alderman, who &s;nores in his Pew after Dinner, during Sermon-time.</P>
<P>The Lady of the Manor had been walking that Afternoon with her Wo|man along the Meadows; her Hou&s;e was but two Fields off from the Spot where Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> re&s;ted him&s;elf; he cou'd not di&s;cover it, becau&s;e a thick Grove prevented on that Side a Foot-pa&s;&s;enger's View. When &s;he came to the Place where <HI>Tom</HI> lay, &s;he was &s;urpriz'd; her Maid was di&s;mally frighten'd, and wou'd have run Home to call for Help, but &s;he was order'd to &s;tay, Curiou&s;ity ju&s;t
<PB N="235" REF="242">then giving the Lady a Twitch by the Sleeve, ob&s;erving the &s;leepy Per&s;on to be well-dre&s;s'd; &s;he walk'd up gently towards him, and began &s;oftly to prai&s;e his Figure.</P>
<P>Indeed Mem, as you &s;ay, (replied Mrs. <HI>Pinner</HI>) he is the mo&s;t genteele&s;t Man I have &s;een out of <HI>London,</HI> and yet you may &s;ee Mem he as been walking a good way, by the Du&s;t upon his Shoes and Stockings; and Mem what a white Hand he has too, and <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> Ruffles on:&mdash;As &s;ure as God made the World he's a Gentleman, Mem, and may-hap misfortuneable in Love, for I thought as how he &s;igh'd.&mdash;Pray Mem let me wake him, for fear may-hap &s;ome Ver|min &s;hould bite him.</P>
<P>Her mi&s;tre&s;s was as willing as her Woman, to know what cou'd bring a well-dre&s;s'd, agreeable-looking Man on Foot there; took a Pinch of Snuff, and lightly let it fall upon his upper Lip;&mdash;he &s;neez'd,&mdash;wak'd,&mdash;started up, and be|held the lovely Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> &s;tanding before him.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool</HI> made an unaffected Apo|logy for his being there, hop'd he had committed no Tre&s;pa&s;s; told the Lady he was a Stranger who had lo&s;t his Way, and begg'd &s;he wou'd permit
<PB N="236" REF="243">one of her Servants to &s;et him into the right Road.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Countenance was open and florid, the Tone of his Voice particularly &s;weet, and plaintive; his Eyes were not broad-&s;tretch'd into a rude Stare, but he now and then lift them up while he was &s;peaking, and his Look was tender, mode&s;t, and &s;en&s;ible, yet his whole Deportment &s;eem'd to &s;peak a Mind in Grief, at lea&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> thought &s;o, and the Appearance of Di|&s;tre&s;s is &s;ure to waken a delicate Sympathy in female Minds; which, to the Shame of mighty Man be it know, all our Reading cannot make us Ma&s;ters of, nor all our Writings properly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Upon Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI>'s Invitation, <HI>Tom Fool</HI> attended her to the Hall; where, with a Grace peculiar to fine Women of Fa&s;hion, &s;he reque&s;ted he wou'd let her know how &s;he cou'd give her Leave to a&s;&s;ure him, that the Laws of Ho&s;pitality flouri&s;h'd under her Roof.&mdash;To be &s;ure it might &s;eem odd,&mdash;but as &s;he was above Di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf, flatter'd her&s;elf he was &s;o too:&mdash;Perhaps &s;he might be wrong,&mdash;but &s;he fancied he had lo&s;t &s;omething more than his Way.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244"><HI>Tom Fool</HI> was not &s;o eager to relate his Adventures, as &s;he was to hear them. He told the Lady he was a Gentleman,&mdash;had been hurt by fal&s;e Friend&s;hips, and from thence took Occa&s;ion to de|claim on the Fal&s;hoods of Mankind.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep,</HI> in who&s;e Heart Com|pa&s;&s;ion had a noble Dwelling-place, view'd him with Pity; but 'twas a Pity mix'd with Approbation. She took Part in all he &s;aid, look'd as he look'd, &s;igh'd as he &s;igh'd; his Mind &s;he found was manly as his Per&s;on, his Sentiments ge|nerous and tender, his Ob&s;ervations ju|dicious, yet without either Flattery or Rancour.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> who was amorous as <HI>Ovid,</HI> &s;ur|vey'd with Attention the Brilliancy of the Lady's Figure, and di&s;cover'd, by con|ver&s;ing with her, how elegant her Mind was enrich'd. Thus by Degrees the Under&s;tanding, the Accompli&s;hments, each di&s;cover'd in each, rais'd a recipro|cal E&s;teem; pleas'd with the Entertain|ment, they &s;at up together till Morning; and even then the Day wou'd have been unheeded by them, tho' the Sun darted his Rays cro&s;s the Room, had not Mrs. <HI>Pinner</HI> ventured in, to beg Leave to know when Mem wou'd plea&s;e to have Breakfa&s;t.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Fool</HI> had been at the amiable Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI>'s above a Week, before he had Time to relate all his Ad|ventures; he had often begun, and of|ten had &s;he interrupted him, either by tenderly &s;ympathi&s;ing with his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or bur&s;ting out into Prai&s;es of his Di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s.</P>

<P>At that In&s;tant Mrs. <HI>Pinner</HI> entering, acquainted Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> that there was a Man came on Hor&s;e-back, that had a Letter, which he will deliver into no|body's Hands, but your Honour's.

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251">After Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> had read tho&s;e Letters, &s;he return'd them to Mr. <HI>Fool;</HI> but her Hand &s;he had not withdrawn from his. In that Po&s;ition, for &s;ome Moments, they &s;tood &s;ilent; tenderly looking at each other; at length <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> his Eyes gli&s;&s;ening with Compa&s;&s;i|on, thus addre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Madam, had not the Ho&s;pitality Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> has &s;hown to a poor wandering Outca&s;t, bound him by the &s;tricte&s;t Ties of Gratitude, not to depart with|out fir&s;t, at lea&s;t, acknowledging the Favours he had receiv'd, I &s;hould not he&s;itate a Moment obeying the Purport of the&s;e Advices; but circum&s;tanced as I am, 'tis to you, and you only, I ap|ply for Advice. What am I, Madam, to do?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Demirep.</SPEAKER>
<P>To go.&mdash;To go this In&s;tant.&mdash;I may be irregular, but am not abandon'd&mdash;I love mightly, but not meanly.&mdash;There|fore go, this In&s;tant go. 'Tis not my Advice alone, but my Intreaty, go. And may your Pre&s;ence pre&s;erve your Lady's Health. At the &s;ame Time &s;he &s;poke this, checking a &s;welling Sigh, which Pa&s;&s;ion, in Spite of Rea&s;on's Teeth, was bur&s;ting out with. Then
<PB N="245" REF="252">&s;tepped forward to throw her Arms about his Neck, and take a parting Em|brace&mdash;but recollecting, that her Ca|re&s;&s;es might detain him &s;ome Minutes, &s;he check'd her&s;elf, and broke from him, &s;aying,&mdash;No, not a Ki&s;s of mine &s;hall &s;top you a Moment on a Event like this&mdash;Adieu&mdash;And immedi|ately ru&s;h'd up Stairs into her Dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
</SP>
<P>Ju&s;t as Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> reach'd Home, his Lady had another Fit; and as the Fa|culty had fortold, lived but two Days after her Hu&s;band's Return, leaving him in clear Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of full two thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and &s;everal Sums of ready Money.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Burial was over, Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Borlace,</HI> and with an Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s peculiar to the noble-minded Part of Mankind, told him;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Borlace;</HI> Providence has been pleas'd to favour me with a large Inde|pendency; therefore I look upon it as my Duty to lay out the Superfluity of my Income, in endeavouring to make tho&s;e happy, I think de&s;erve it. I will neither mantain Race-hor&s;es, to enrich Grooms; nor make &s;umptuous Enter|tainments, to cram Flatterers; or let
<PB N="246" REF="253">my Servants learn the Way to Profu&s;ion&mdash;no&mdash;I am beholding to that Being, to whom we all owe our Beings; and how can I te&s;tify my Gratitude? He &s;tands not in Need of any Thing I have; but I will endeavour to copy &s;ome &s;mall Part of his Goodne&s;s, and be bountiful in my Turn; for rich Men are, or &s;hou'd be, God's Agents for him to the Poor.</P>
<P>I am not now to be told the Di&s;po&s;i|tion my Si&s;ter and you entertain for each other&mdash;but her Hu&s;band is living; as &s;oon as I can legally procure a Divorce, I will, if I can, make you happy together.</P>
<P>As you left your Affairs in <HI>London</HI> in Di&s;order, you will find in this Pocket-book a Sufficiency, I believe, to defray your Creditors Demands; and this I wou'd have you do immediately; &s;et out for Town To-morrow Morning. You'll excu&s;e me Mr. <HI>Borlace;</HI> but as you have &s;een and &s;uffered &s;o much, you are &s;uf|ficiently wean'd from the Weakne&s;s of Indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P><HI>Witwoud</HI> wanted to throw him&s;elf at Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Feet, called him his Guardian Angel, and by &s;everal de&s;perate Oaths, wou'd have given Bond for his good Be|haviour, but his Friend prevented him: However, nothing cou'd hinder <HI>Borlace</HI> from &s;wearing he de&s;pi&s;ed Debauchery,
<PB N="247" REF="254">cour&s;ing the Madne&s;s of Riot, and exe|crating all the Folly of Extravagance; and concluded with a very pathetic Ob|&s;ervation, concerning Mi&s;ery and Con|tempt.</P>
<P>Thus is the Apothegm of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> made out. Man may know much of every Thing in the World except him|&s;elf; for, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be in <HI>London</HI> with Money in his Poc|ket, and not be found out by his Friends; &s;o it was for him, when found out, to avoid keeping Company with them. For that Man of Spirit wou'd be &s;tig|matiz'd with the odious Appellation of a damn'd &s;neaking Fellow? <HI>Borlace</HI> therefore, being a Man of Spirits, will|ing to convince his Friends, whatever Alterations he had undergone, were all for the better, kept it up, indeed, was quite the Thing, <HI>ad unguem.</HI> As his Ho|nour and Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> told him, &s;haking him heartily by the Hand; damn them, if they wou'd not back him for a Thou|&s;and, and take him again&s;t the Field.</P>
<P>As we have therefore brought him to <HI>London,</HI> and left him in &s;uch good Com|pany, we mu&s;t return to look after our other Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>It is Time to bring this Bundle of many Sections to a tolerable Conclu&s;ion;
<PB N="248" REF="255">and we will immediately to it, according to the pre&s;ent practis'd Rules of Me|moir-writing. We have taken them thro' Pages &s;ufficient to &s;well this Work into two Volumes. And now we have nothing to do but marry them off; like <HI>Fleet</HI> Par&s;ons, we mu&s;t be expeditious in our Vocation: For we have many Sweet-hearts in Pairs, who, like Country-dancing Couples, &s;tand on Tip-toe to be at it.</P>
<P>In a little Time after <HI>Witwoud Bor|lace</HI>'s Arrival in <HI>London,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI> went up, &s;o &s;ee every Thing was in pro|per Order in the late Lady <HI>Fool</HI>'s Town|hou&s;e.

<P>All was Embrace, all was Rapture, all was Admiration.&mdash;When gently leading her to the love-receiving Settee, he thus addre&s;&s;ed the all-attentive Lady.</P>

<P>Soon after <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> having hand&s;omely acquitted her&s;elf of her vi&s;itants, &s;tepp'd into her Po&s;t-chai&s;e for her <HI>London</HI> Journey: How often upon the Road did &s;he rail at Tyrant-cu&s;tom, then cur&s;e our boa&s;ting Sex, then blame her&s;elf for her own Delicacy.</P>
<P>On the other Side, how wou'd &s;he &s;ometimes congratulate her&s;elf upon her Re&s;ignation, her Re&s;olution, her Mar|tyrdom, as &s;he term'd it.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t love me for it, I'm con|&s;cious he mu&s;t (thus &s;he plea&s;ed her&s;elf with reflecting) he does, he will,&mdash; tho' I &s;hall not have him for a Hu&s;band, yet <HI>as</HI> a Hu&s;band he's mine, he will be mine; mine, and only mine;&mdash;but all is not Gold that looks &s;o;&mdash;every Reck|oning is not always right.&mdash;However, we will &s;o far reckon right, as here to fini&s;h the Chapter; and the next we begin, with Joy the Editor declares it to be.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Tom Fool</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> he found <HI>Borlace</HI> had made a very had U&s;e of the Sum he had been in|tru&s;ted with; <HI>Witwoud</HI> al&s;o had been rather too premature, in communicating to his Companions the Hi&s;tory of his good Fortune with Mr. <HI>Fool;</HI> nay, to his very great Intimates, he whi&s;per'd, that he had had Mi&s;s <HI>Fool;</HI> and hinted &s;ome|thing about patching up Reputations, and that Matrimony's Pill &s;hou'd be well &s;weetned.</P>
<P>Cur&s;e on that Flippancy of Tongue; Why will you, ye maudlin Declaimers, why will ye form &s;uch midnight Friend|&s;hips? Ye Mementos of Indi&s;cretion, who per&s;i&s;t, &s;pite of Shame or Sufferings, like venom-breathing Serpents, do di&s;charge Infection from your Mouths.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI> had not conducted her&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Circum&s;pection, during her Abode in <HI>London:</HI> Her Behaviour at public Places, prejudic'd the grave Part of the World from entertaining a good Opinion, either of her Morals or Under&s;tanding. It is not worth while to de&s;cribe her Dre&s;s, or her Manner at
<PB N="258" REF="265">public Places: We &s;ee many fine Ladies, who&s;e Actions and Appearance &s;eem to &s;ay (like the Founder of the Fea&s;t, when Dinner's upon the Table) Come, Gentle|men, won't ye plea&s;e to fall to.</P>
<P>Her Brother very mildly expo&s;tulated with her, and mention'd the Word De|cency. &mdash;She replied, Stuff; but &s;he &s;poke that Word a&s;ide, to her&s;elf. He obe&s;erv'd to her, that no Per&s;on &s;hou'd incur, if they cou'd help it, the World's Cen&s;ures.&mdash;That &s;he took very ill;&mdash; did not An&s;wer him indeed, but begg'd Leave to retire; and ready to bur&s;t with Vexation, hurried into her own Apart|ment, flung her&s;elf into an arm'd Chair, and with Tears told her Woman, as the Maid held out the Lavender Drops to her,&mdash;<HI>Hannah,</HI> my Brother is become a perfect Tyrant, <HI>that</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> has &s;et him again&s;t me.</P>
<P>But to <HI>Witwoud Borlace, Tom Fool</HI> was more &s;evere: He reprov'd him very &s;harply; nay, was almo&s;t angry with him, for &s;o ridiculou&s;ly &s;quandring away a Sum of Money; which, as Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> told him, was the Property of his Cre|ditors.</P>
<P><HI>Witwoud,</HI> who not only had a great Share of Spirits, but had al&s;o a great
<PB N="259" REF="266">Spirit, cou'd ill brook to be told of his Faults, by one much younger than him|&s;elf, and who had not &s;een half &s;o much of the World neither.&mdash;He was mad in his Mind,&mdash;but had Cunning enough to conceal it.</P>
<P>He told <HI>Tom Fool</HI> a long Story how he was made drunk, he cou'd not tell how; and then indeed he did, he cou'd not tell what; that he had a great many Enemies, and that they had rais'd a Parcel for Reports out of Envy again&s;t him; that for his Part, he was fuddled at fir&s;t, by the only Method that cou'd have made him &s;o, which was drinking Bumpers to Mr. <HI>Fool</HI>'s Health.&mdash;How|ever, he wou'd not drink any more, for he &s;aw now it was a Plant again&s;t him, to get me Sir out of your Favour; for I'll be doubly damn'd before I'd give &s;o good a Man as you a Offence.</P>
<P>But this Conce&s;&s;ion only la&s;ted before <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> for the Moment he left the Parlour, he flew to Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny;</HI> and af|ter giving Vent to half-a-dozen full|mouth'd Oaths, he declar'd her Brother to be a mean-&s;pirited Fellow: What's his Money to me? Or where wou'd he have had any Money if it had not been for me?&mdash;Damn it, is &s;uch a Man as
<PB N="260" REF="267">I am to be &s;chool'd, as if I was &s;ent like a Servant to Market, and &s;o mu&s;t give an Account of every Penny and Two|pence. I tell you what <HI>Ninny,</HI> had he not been your Brother, I &s;hou'd have an&s;wer'd him in another Way, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Minny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Witwoud,</HI> I am horribly cha|green'd my Brother &s;hou'd behave &s;o; I can't conceive what can make him &s;o execrably in the Wrong; and mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, am undetermin'd how to behave in this Affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Borlace.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am not, and I'll tell you the only Thing we have to do in this Affair: If we don't put &s;ome Stop to this, your Brother will always be calling us to an Account for what we do, and where we go; now that I'd not bear from the great <HI>Mogul.</HI> I know he loves you dearly, and if you was to leave him a little, it wou'd bring him to a better Way of Thinking. The only Thing we have to do, is this: We mu&s;t &s;how a proper Spirit of Re&s;entment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Ninny.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all Means, Mr. <HI>Borlace.</HI></P>

<PB N="261" REF="268">
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Borlace.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, therefore let you and I take a little Journey together. I can rai&s;e &s;ome Money I know. You &s;hall leave a Letter for him, wherein you &s;hall tell him, the Severity of his Behaviour to you has drove you away. This will make him unea&s;y,&mdash;he'll do any Thing to bring you back again. He'll &s;end Po&s;t for us; but before we return, we'll come into &s;ome Agreement with him: Let me alone with him for that, I know enough of the World to manage your Brother, I warrant you; then we &s;hall live ju&s;t as we like, and he'll never find Fault with us again, for fear you &s;hou'd go away, never to return.</P>
</SP>
<P>However ridiculous this Scheme was, Mi&s;s <HI>Fool,</HI> who&s;e whole Life had been but a Series of indi&s;creet Attachments, at once came into it; nay, &s;he rejoiced to think &s;he had an Opportunity to be reveng'd of her Brother, for his &s;colding her. On the Evening that Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> came to Town, they two took Po&s;t for <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> received a Card from Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep,</HI> he was reading the mad Epi&s;tle his Si&s;ter had left behind her.&mdash; He inclos'd it in a Letter to Mi&s;s <HI>De|mirep,</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="269">and in which, after he had rela|ted Mi&s;s <HI>Ninny</HI>'s Elopement, he told her, that Folly and Ingratitude had &s;o much &s;hock'd his Temper, he was not in a Condition fit for Society; that he was determin'd to retire for &s;ome Time at lea&s;t from the World. And as he had &s;everal Affairs to &s;ettle in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> he wou'd go over to that I&s;land imme|diately.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he had read the Contents, flew to Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> and made u&s;e of every Argument to di&s;|&s;uade him from undertaking &s;o dange|rous a Voyage.&mdash;But as it &s;ometimes happens, when two Per&s;ons of different Religions di&s;pute, the Argumentator, who de&s;igns to make the Pro&s;elyte, be|comes him&s;elf a Convert. Thus Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> brought Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> over to his Opinion; &s;he attended him to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and &s;aw him take Shipping for <HI>Port-Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor, Tran&s;criber, Hi&s;torian, Journali&s;ts, &amp;c. &amp;c. begs Leave to a&s;|&s;ure the Public, that as Mi&s;s <HI>Demi|rep</HI> was capable of giving the mo&s;t ex|traordinary Proofs of Affection to Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> &s;he did &s;o; &s;ecretly contracting with the Captain for her own and Mem
<PB N="263" REF="270"><HI>Pinner</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;age, and by a hand&s;ome Pre|mium enjoin'd him Secre&s;y.</P>
<P>The very next Day, when the Ve&s;&s;el was going bri&s;kly before the Wind, and <HI>Tom Fool</HI> was walking upon the Quar|ter Deck, the Captain's Boy came to tell him his Ma&s;ter wanted to &s;peak to him in the great Cabbin: We'll leave to the Imagination of the Reader, what his Thoughts mu&s;t be, when he &s;aw coming forward to meet him, as he en|ter'd the Room-door, the noble-minded Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep.</HI></P>
