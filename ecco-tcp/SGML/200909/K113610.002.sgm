<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>_NEVER did Monarch come to the throne of England with a greater
va|riety of favourable concurrences than Charles I. He found him&s;elf
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a peaceful and flouri&s;hing king|dom, his right
undi&s;puted by any ri|val claimant, &s;trengthened by an alliance with one of
the mo&s;t powerful Monarchs that ever reigned in France, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter he
had married; and, to add to all this, he was loved by his &s;ubjects, whom he
had won by his virtues and addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"> But this was but a flattering pro&s;pect; the
&s;pirit of liberty was rouzed, and was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the ancient
claims of Monarchs, who u&s;urped their power in times of ignorance or danger,
confirmed it by laws, and continued it by long pre&s;cription. Charles had
been, from his infancy, taught to con|&s;ider the royal privileges as &s;acred
pledges, which it was his duty to defend: his father had implanted the
doctrines of hereditary and indefea&s;ible right early upon his mind. James
only defended tho&s;e doctrines by words, and it was &s;oon the fate of Charles
to a&s;&s;ert them by action. It is the duty of every So|vereign to con&s;ider
the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of his people, as a father does that of his
children, and to adapt his government to each conjuncture. Charles mi&s;took
that genius; he wanted to govern a people who had, for &s;ome time, learned to
be free by maxims and precedents, that had their origin in times of ignorance
and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>He therefore began his reign with two of the mo&s;t difficult
projects that could be conceived; the one to &s;uccour the Prote&s;tants in
Germany again&s;t the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria; the other to keep the royal
prerogatives entire, without a national &s;tanding army. In order to effect
the&s;e purpo&s;es, the hou&s;e of commons was to be managed, who, as I have
already de&s;cribed, from being the oppre&s;&s;ed par|ty, were now willing, in
turn, to become oppre&s;|&s;ors; who, from a dete&s;tation of Popery, had now
over&s;hot the mark, and were become Puritans. His fir&s;t demand for the
nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies to carry on the war of the Palatinate in Germany,
though un|dertaken at their own reque&s;t, was an&s;wered with a petition for
puni&s;hing Papi&s;ts, and for an examina|tion into the grievances of the
nation. Buckingham, who had been the late King's favourite, and who was &s;till
more care&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ent Monarch, did not e&s;cape their cen&s;ures:
in&s;tead of granting the <PB N="3" REF="6"> &s;ums requi&s;ite, they employed
the time in vain di&s;|putations and complaints, till the &s;ea&s;on for
pro&s;e|cuting the intended campaign was elap&s;ed. The King, therefore, at
length wearied with their de|lays, and offended at their contempt of his
demands, thought proper to di&s;&s;olve a parliament which he could not bring
to rea&s;on. In fact, the commons, at this time, complained of imaginary
grievances, but the time was approaching when their complaints were to become
real.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of the King had not yet forgot that kind of tax
which was called a benevolence, and which had been often exacted from the
&s;ubject in former reigns. Charles thought to avail him&s;elf of this method
of procuring money, but at the &s;ame time coloured it over with a greater
appearance of ju&s;tice than any of his predece&s;&s;ors. He therefore
determined to borrow money of &s;uch per&s;ons as were be&s;t able to lend, to
whom, for this purpo&s;e, he di|rected letters, mentioning the &s;um. With this
the people reluctantly complied; it was, in fact, a griev|ance, though
authori&s;ed by a thou&s;and precedents; but no precedent can give &s;anction
to inju&s;tice. With this money a fleet was equipped and &s;ent again&s;t
Spain, but which returned without procuring either glory or advantage.</P>
<P>This ineffectual expedition demanded to be re|paired by a new
&s;upply greater than what extorted loans could produce, and another parliament
was called for this purpo&s;e. The new parliament, upon this occa&s;ion,
&s;eemed even more refractory than the former, and appeared more willing to
make or to com|plain of grievances than to grant money: but chiefly their
re&s;entment was directed again&s;t Buckingham, the royal favourite. Whenever
the &s;ubjects attack the royal prerogative, they begin with the favourites of
the crown; and wi&s;e Princes, &s;en&s;ible of this, &s;el|dom have any.
Charles was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <PB N="4" REF="7"> art of making a
di&s;tinction between friends and mini|&s;ters; whoever was his favourite him
he always en|tru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of affairs; he loved
Buckingham, and undertook to defend him: to defend this nobleman was to &s;hare
his reproach; two mem|bers of the hou&s;e of commons, Diggs and Elliot,
un|dertook to accu&s;e him. The purport of the charge a|mounted to little more
than that he had engro&s;&s;ed too much power for him&s;elf and his relations,
and that he had applied a plai&s;ter to the late King's &s;ide which was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be poi&s;onous. They inveighed again&s;t the Duke from this
frivolous accu&s;ation, and the King, in a pa&s;&s;ion, ordered them both to
the Tower. This was an open act of violence, and &s;hould have been
&s;upported, or ever performed. The commons exclaimed, that their privileges
were infringed; they prote&s;ted that neither of the members had &s;poken any
thing di&s;re&s;pectful of his Maje&s;ty, and began to publi&s;h their
vindication. The King, who was ever ready to enter upon har&s;h mea&s;ures, but
not to &s;up|port them, relea&s;ed the two members, and this com|pliance
confirmed that ob&s;tinacy which his former injury had contributed to rai&s;e.
The Earl of Arun|del, for being guilty of the &s;ame offence in the hou&s;e of
Lords, was impri&s;oned and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner by the King.
The two hou&s;es having in this manner an&s;wered the royal demands for mo|ney,
the King, rather than give up the Duke, cho&s;e to be without the &s;upply, and
therefore once more di&s;&s;olved the parliament.</P>
<P>He had now a war to maintain, which he was engaged in by the advice
of tho&s;e very members who refu&s;ed to contribute to its &s;upport; be&s;ides
this, he was to put the kingdom in a proper po&s;ture of de|fence, and he
wanted money to execute the&s;e pur|po&s;es. To furni&s;h the proper &s;upplies
he again had recour&s;e to loans, and to granting protections to the Papi&s;ts,
for &s;tipulated &s;ums of money: &s;uch as re|fu&s;ed <PB N="5" REF="8"> had
&s;oldiers billetted upon them, contrary to the cu&s;toms of England; and even
&s;ome were en|rolled for &s;oldiers them&s;elves. Per&s;ons of birth and rank
were &s;ummoned to appear before the council, and, upon their per&s;i&s;ting in
a refu&s;al, were put into confinement. We now once more perceive the &s;eeds
of di&s;cord beginning to &s;hoot forth: we now &s;ee, as in every other civil
war, both parties guilty of in|ju&s;tice, yet on either &s;ide that inju&s;tice
ari&s;ing from principles of virtue; the one actuated by the inhe|rent
liberties of mankind, the other by the pre&s;crip|tive privileges of the crown:
&s;uch is the general lot of humanity, to have their actions degenerate from
the producing motives.</P>
<P>The King, now finding that nothing but the pro&s;|pect of immediate
danger could induce &s;ome future parliament to provide nece&s;&s;ary
&s;upplies, was re&s;olved to make a rupture with France, a war again&s;t which
had ever been an expedient of producing unanimity at home. With this view he
&s;ent out Buckingham with a fleet to relieve Rochelle, a maritime town in that
kingdom, which had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the French King,
and which he was now actually preparing to deprive them of. This expedition was
equally fruitle&s;s with that to the coa&s;ts of Spain; the Duke knew nothing
of the art of war, and con&s;umed his time in be&s;ieging a little fort in the
i&s;le of Rhee, from whence he was driven with the lo&s;s of half his army. The
bad &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;erved to render the unfortunate Duke &s;till more
obnoxious, and the King more needy; another parliament was therefore called,
and a &s;upply demanded in the u&s;ual form. The commons, in the fir&s;t
parliament, had begun with fictitious grievances, but their refu&s;ing then to
contribute the &s;upplies &s;oon introduced an actual abu&s;e of power, and
rendered the King un|ju&s;t, who, probably, only de&s;ired to be ea&s;y. He
ex|torted &s;upplies, and impri&s;oned the refractory. The <PB N="6" REF="9">
complaints of the commons were now real; their members had been impri&s;oned,
loans had been ex|torted; a tax upon merchandize, called tonnage and poundage,
had been exacted without parliamentary authority; and, la&s;t of all, the Duke
of Bucking|ham was &s;till &s;uffered to rule the councils of the King, and
inflame every proceeding. In this &s;itua|tion they &s;eemed, as u&s;ual,
re&s;olved to grant no mo|ney till their grievances were redre&s;&s;ed, and
till the King had given a po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance to maintain the liberties of
the &s;ubject. The King promi&s;ed both, and they voted him a liberal &s;upply,
upon which they were prorogued, as was cu&s;tomary. This fre&s;h &s;upply
enabled his Maje&s;ty to make another attempt to relieve Rochelle, and the Duke
of Buckingham was again to have the command: Buckingham had ever be|haved with
&s;ome haughtine&s;s, as being &s;ecure of the King's protection; but his
greate&s;t fault &s;eemed to be too large a &s;hare of power, which gave
offence to every order. It is the aim of all malecontents in a &s;tate rather
to bring the great down to their own level, than to exalt the inferior order to
theirs: and this might be a motive to the lords and commons for attempting to
retrench Buckingham's power. The clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t him in the hou&s;e
was not lo&s;t among the people; they re-echoed it from one to the other, and
the Duke had a million of foes only from his &s;eeming pro&s;perity. Among this
number was one John Felton, an Iri&s;hman, a lieutenant in the army; this man
was naturally melancholy, cou|rageous, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic; he felt for his
country as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of
his &s;ingle arm to remove: he re&s;olved to kill the Duke, and thus to do a
&s;ervice both to God and man. Animated with mi&s;taken patrioti&s;m and gloomy
zeal, he reached Port&s;mouth, where the Duke was then, &s;urrounded with his
levee, giving the nece&s;&s;ary orders to embark. Felton came up a|mong 
<PB N="7" REF="10"> the crowd and &s;tabbed him with a long knife to the heart;
the Duke in&s;tantly fell dead, and Fel|ton walked compo&s;edly away; but his
hat had fallen off while he was &s;triking the blow, and this produced his
di&s;covery. He di&s;dained denying a murder in which he gloried, and averred
that he looked upon the Duke as an enemy to his country, and, as &s;uch,
de&s;erving to &s;uffer. We &s;hall &s;ee through the cour&s;e of this reign
&s;everal in&s;tances of great virtues and enormous vices, for the genius of
England was at this time arrived at its highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>The expedition to Rochelle again returned with|out &s;ucce&s;s, as
if it had been ordered by fate that no|thing was to put the people into good
humour. The conte&s;t therefore between privilege and prerogative was now
carried on with the &s;ame acrimony as be|fore. Tonnage and poundage was
exacted by the King as a right belonging to the crown, and refu&s;ed by the
merchants as a tax that could only be granted by the people. The parliament was
called to deter|mine the di&s;pute, but, in&s;tead of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing that
ar|gument, they entered upon di&s;putes about religion. The hou&s;e was
mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of Puritans, and &s;uch were for aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy,
and per&s;ecuting Papi&s;ts. They were freed from Buckingham; but there was
another favourite whom they dreaded &s;till more, Laud Archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury, a great fa|vourer of the opinion of <HI>Divine right,</HI> and
firmly attached to the rites of the church as then e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. They
&s;eemed willing to allow the King no fa|vourite, and therefore loudly murmured
again&s;t this Bi&s;hop. Their indignation, however, was, for a while, called
off to another object, which was con|&s;idered as a new act of violence in the
King. His cu&s;tomhou&s;e officers had &s;eized upon the goods of one or two
merchants who refu&s;ed to pay tonnage and poundage. The Judges, in the former
reign of James I, had adjudged this tax to belong to the <PB N="8" REF="11">
crown without con&s;ent of parliament. The former reign therefore had been the
proper time for di&s;put|ing the King's right, but the commons had then not
&s;o much power, or &s;uch a &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance as now. They were now
perfectly &s;en&s;ible of their own &s;trength, and were re&s;olved to fix the
limits between the King and the people. They therefore boldly and warmly
remon&s;trated again&s;t the King's proceeding; and he in return impri&s;oned
four of the members, and di&s;|&s;olved the parliament. The&s;e were the
cau&s;es which &s;oon after overturned the &s;tate, and laid the throne in
blood.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AMonarchical government has ever been looked upon as be&s;t, when
wi&s;ely admini&s;tered. We are &s;o con&s;tituted by nature that &s;ome are
born to command, and others to obey. In a republic, how free &s;oever, the
people cannot govern them&s;elves, and their leaders mu&s;t be tyrants over
their own narrow circle of &s;ubjects. In a monarchy the Governor is placed at
a di&s;tance from the many, as he is but one; in a republic the tyrants are
near, becau&s;e they are many. In the former the people are &s;ubject to
oppre&s;&s;ion from errors of will; in the latter, to be harra&s;&s;ed by the
rigours of the law: in a mo|narchy the redre&s;s of grievances is &s;peedy; in
a re|public, dilatory and uncertain: in the one, puni&s;h|ments are few; in the
other, &s;evere and numerous, from the debility of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent parliament, &s;eemed not &s;o intent upon abridging
the King's power, as upon en|tirely aboli&s;hing it; they were Calvini&s;ts,
and it is <PB N="9" REF="12"> the &s;pirit of Calvini&s;m to throw off the
re&s;traints of royalty. The Engli&s;h had lately &s;een this happily effected
in Switzerland and Holland, and, influ|enced by &s;uch examples, &s;eemed
de&s;irous of imita|tion.</P>
<P>You have &s;een the King and the Engli&s;h parlia|ment now almo&s;t
prepared for an open rupture; &s;till, however, the commons kept within the
bounds of humble remon&s;trance, and, while they refu&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's
demands, a&s;ked pardon for their delay. They had &s;till a re&s;pect for their
Monarch, which even their republican principles could not entirely efface; and,
though they were willing to wound, yet they feared to &s;trike an open blow.
The Scotch &s;oon &s;et them an example of re&s;i&s;tance; they had, in that
kingdom, long embraced the Calvini&s;tical doctrines; and, though they &s;till
had Bi&s;hops, the&s;e were reduced to poverty, and treated with contempt.
James I. attempted to exalt the Bi&s;hops, and to introduce the rites and the
liturgy of the church of England among them, but died in the mid&s;t of his
endeavours. Charles, therefore, was re&s;olved to complete what his father had
begun. This unnece&s;&s;ary and ill|judged attempt alienated the affections of
his Scotoh &s;ubjects. The &s;edition pa&s;t from city to city; the
Calvini&s;ts formed a league, as if all the laws, divine and human, were
infringed; while the de&s;ire in the court party of &s;upporting their
commands, and, in the people, of defending their religion, &s;oon, excited,
actually, in Scotland, tho&s;e dangers which in Eng|land were, as yet, only
apprehended.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation the King could only repre&s;s the
pre&s;umption of his Scotch &s;ubjects by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of tho&s;e of
England; but he had lately di&s;&s;olu|ed his parliament, and &s;eemed no way
di&s;po&s;ed to call another; he had cut off the &s;ources of every &s;upply in
ca&s;es of emergency, and fondly hoped he <PB N="10" REF="13"> could govern by
merely the terror of royalty. His favourites helped to confirm his errors; they
were fond of arbitrary power, becau&s;e they &s;hared its in|dulgences; the
privy council con&s;idered it&s;elf as ab&s;olute; the Star-Chamber, as it was
called, &s;e|verely puni&s;hed all who denied the prerogative royal; the High
Commi&s;&s;ion court now turned from defend|ing the Papi&s;ts again&s;t the
Puritans, whom they ju&s;tly feared, as tinctured with the &s;pirit of
re&s;i&s;t|ance. The very Judges al&s;o, being cho&s;en by the court, were
entirely devoted to the King; &s;o that all con&s;pired to lift him above
ju&s;tice, and induced him to call parliaments no more, who&s;e maxims of
go|vernment he found diametrically oppo&s;ite to his own.</P>
<P>He was therefore re&s;olved to fix upon other me|thods of rai&s;ing
money: methods indeed which were practi&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors, but at
times when they had power to controll even ju&s;tice, and force to com|pel
their &s;ubjects to obey. Charles, in the mid&s;t of a civil war in Scotland,
and the di&s;contents of his people at home, at a time when one half of his
&s;ub|jects were preaching &s;edition, and the other half were learning to
de&s;pi&s;e Kings; without army, and without trea&s;ures; re&s;olved to reign
with arbitrary power.</P>
<P>With the taxes which he levied without parlia|ments in England, he
undertook to bring about the reformation in Scotland; and therefore began, as
his parliament was now no more, to collect a tax upon the &s;ubject called
<HI>Ship-money.</HI> This is that fa|mous tax which fir&s;t rouzed a whole
nation, after an un&s;ettled con&s;titution of more than a thou&s;and years, at
length to fix and determine the bounds of their own freedom, and the King's
prerogative.</P>
<P>To give a &s;anction to the royal orders, this tax was backed by the
opinion of all the Judges, who voted it to be cu&s;tomary and legal. Their
opinion <PB N="11" REF="14"> will, at once, &s;erve to explain the nature of
this tax, and what they judged concerning it. It ran thus, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>We, every man by him&s;elf, and all of us
together, have taken into &s;erious con&s;ideration the ca&s;e and que&s;tion
concerning Ship-money; and it is our opinion, that when the good and &s;afety
of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the Kingdom in danger, that your

<P>An order from the throne, thus backed by the opi|nion of all the
Judges, it was thought, would be, at once, complied with; but the King was
deceived. A private man, of courage and integrity, one John Hampden, &s;tood
forth as a champion for the people, and refu&s;ed to pay a tax not authorized
by parlia|ment. The &s;um at which he was rated amounted to but twenty
&s;hillings, yet he refu&s;ed to contribute even this, and brought his cau&s;e
before the court of Exchequer. Never was a greater cau&s;e argued in any court
before. The Judges, by their &s;entence, were to determine whether the nation,
and their po&s;terity, were to be &s;ubject to arbitrary power, or to enjoy
freedom. The Judges determined in favour of &s;ervitude; Hampden was ca&s;t;
and this only &s;erved to increa&s;e the di&s;contents of the people.</P>
<P>The di&s;content and oppo&s;ition the King found among his Engli&s;h
&s;ubjects, one would have thought, might &s;erve to repre&s;s his ardour for
reformation in the religion of Scotland. Having publi&s;hed an or|der 
<PB N="12" REF="15"> for reading the liturgy in the principal church in
Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and imprecations; the
court-party blamed their ob&s;tinacy, as the innovations were trifling; but
this was re|torted again&s;t them&s;elves with &s;till greater force, for
labouring &s;o earne&s;tly at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of trifles. The &s;edition
in that kingdom, which had hitherto been &s;ecret, was now kept concealed no
longer; rebellion had, as it were, &s;et up its &s;tandard among&s;t them. Yet
&s;till the King could not re&s;olve to de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign; and &s;o
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very
name of a King would influence them to return to duty. He was &s;oon
undeceived; the Scotch Calvini&s;ts, who&s;e principles were republican,
entered into a covenant to &s;uppre&s;s the Bi&s;hops, and re&s;i&s;t the
King's autho|rity. This was judged an open declaration of war, and Charles
&s;ummoned the Nobility of England, who held lands of the crown, to furni&s;h a
proper number of forces to &s;uppre&s;s them. To add to his &s;upplies, he
demanded a voluntary contribution from the Clergy, and by means of his Queen
the Catholics al&s;o were pre&s;&s;ed for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By the&s;e
me|thods he found him&s;elf at the head of an undi&s;ci|plined and reluctant
army, amounting to about twenty thou&s;and men, commanded by Generals more
willing to negotiate than to fight. However, his &s;uperiority of number gave
him a manife&s;t advan|tage over the malecontents, who were not &s;low in
marching to oppo&s;e him. Charles had inherited the peaceful di&s;po&s;ition of
his father; he was unwilling to come to extremities, although a blow, then
&s;truck with vigour, might have prevented many of his &s;uc|ceeding
misfortunes. In&s;tead of fighting, he entered upon a treaty; a
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion was concluded upon, and terms agreed to, that neither &s;ide
intended to pre&s;erve. This &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and di&s;banding the ar|mies, 
<PB N="13" REF="16"> was a fatal &s;tep to the King; the Scotch forces could be
again mu&s;tered at plea&s;ure; the Engli&s;h troops, not without time,
difficulty, and expence. Of this the malecontents were &s;en&s;ible, and the
ne|gotiations met with ob&s;tructions in proportion as they were confident of
their power. In &s;hort, after much altercation, and many treaties &s;igned,
and broken, both parties once more re&s;olved upon a war.</P>
<P>War being re&s;olved on, the King now took every method to rai&s;e
money for maintaining it. <HI>Ship-money</HI> was levied as before; &s;ome
other arbitrary taxes were exacted with great &s;everity; but one method of
in|crea&s;ing &s;upplies reflects immortal honour upon tho&s;e who granted
them. His coun&s;ellors and &s;ervants lent the King whatever &s;ums they could
&s;pare, and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed their private fortunes to &s;erve the &s;tate.
Laud, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Ha|milton, contributed
very large &s;ums; but particular|ly Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, gave
his Maje&s;ty twenty thou&s;and pounds. Wentworth was one of tho&s;e great
characters which marked tho&s;e celebrated times. Upon his fir&s;t appearance
in the &s;tate he was foremo&s;t in the oppo&s;ition to the crown; but, finding
his confederates had mixed a &s;pirit of en|thu&s;ia&s;m with their regards for
liberty, he left their &s;ide to take that of the King, which he fancied in
greate&s;t danger. He was brave, wi&s;e, and loyal, and followed the King from
principle, yet without en|tirely approving his conduct.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the re&s;ources of the crown to prepare for a Scotch
war, but they were &s;till in&s;ufficient; and there was but one method more to
furni&s;h larger &s;upplies, namely, by calling a parliament. It was now eleven
years &s;ince Charles had called any. The ungovernable &s;pirit of the la&s;t
had taught him to hate and to fear &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. His wants, how|ever,
at length, induced him to con&s;train his indig|nation, <PB N="14" REF="17">
and, by the advice of his Council, he called another, the members of which were
&s;till more tur|bulent than the former, as they now had &s;till &s;tronger
rea&s;ons for their di&s;content. The hou&s;e of com|mons could not be induced
to treat the Scotch, who were of the &s;ame principles, and contended for the
&s;ame cau&s;e, as their enemies. They looked upon them as friends and
brothers, who only ro&s;e to teach them how to defend their privileges. The
King could reap no other fruits, therefore, from this a&s;|&s;embly, but
murmurings and complaints; every me|thod he had taken to &s;upply him&s;elf
with money was declared an abu&s;e. Tonnage and poundage, &s;hip|money, the
&s;ale of monopolies, the billetting &s;ol|diers upon the citizens were all
voted &s;tretches at ar|bitrary power. The Star-chamber gave particular
offence, and in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;idies the hou&s;e pre&s;ented the King with
nothing but their grievances. Charles once more di&s;&s;olved this parliament,
and thus aggra|vated the di&s;contents of the people.</P>
<P>He had now made enemies of the Scotch nation, and of the commons of
England; it remained to of|fend the city of London; upon their refu&s;ing to
lend him a &s;um of money to carry on the war, he &s;ued them in the
Star-chamber for &s;ome lands in Ireland, and made them pay a con&s;iderable
fine. He conti|nued to exact all the taxes again&s;t which the parlia|ment had
&s;o frequently remon&s;trated; even had he been de&s;potic, &s;uch a conduct
would have &s;hook him on the throne; but, limited as he was, it &s;erved to
complete his overthrow. He could expect little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England;
and the Scotch, &s;en&s;ible of their own influence in that part of his
dominions, led an army of twenty thou&s;and men as far as New|ca&s;tle upon
Tyne, in order to &s;eize upon, or to de|throne him. Having thus prepared his
misfortunes, he found him&s;elf again obliged to call the la&s;t parlia|ment,
which completed his ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"> In&s;tead of granting money, this new
parliament, as all the re&s;t had done, began by demanding to have their
grievances redre&s;&s;ed; they de&s;ired an abo|lition of the Star chamber;
exclaimed again&s;t arbi|trary taxes, and particularly &s;hip-money; and, in
fine, demanded that a new parliament &s;hould be called every three years.
Charles was now obliged to grant tho&s;e demands from nece&s;&s;ity, which in
the beginning of his reign he might have be&s;towed as a favour. He expected to
regain his authority by complying, but he was deceived; nothing could &s;atisfy
the commons but the total abolition of his power. He expected that his
Engli&s;h &s;ubjects would repre&s;s the in&s;o|lence of tho&s;e of Scotland,
but had the mortifica|tion to find the hou&s;e of commons approve their
conduct, and repay their irruption with a reward of three hundred thou&s;and
pounds. He hoped to repre&s;s the Puritanical party in England, but found, to
his &s;urprize, almo&s;t the whole hou&s;e of commons of that per&s;ua&s;ion.
He loved the Earl of Strafford with ten|derne&s;s, and e&s;teemed his wi&s;dom;
and the hou&s;e of commons, con&s;cious of his regards, accu&s;ed the Earl of
high trea&s;on. When we attempt innovation, we &s;eldom know how far our
&s;chemes will extend at la&s;t. This parliament began with redre&s;&s;ing
grievances; they proceeded to reform the &s;tate, and ended in to|tally
de&s;troying the con&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. III.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of a &s;ubject, in which almo&s;t every Engli&s;hman is
partial, it is no ea&s;y matter to avoid falling into their errors; but, I have
labour|ed to view this part of our hi&s;tory, without receiving any bia&s;s
from party; and our con&s;titution is now &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed,
whatever we may think of this Monarch's equity, or his &s;ubjects re&s;olution.
Our laws, at pre&s;ent, differ both from what Charles endeavoured to maintain,
and what his parliaments pretended to enact: we now are all agreed, that the
unlimited power arrogated on one &s;ide, and the tu|multuous freedom introduced
on the other, are both intolerable; yet, of the two, perhaps, de&s;poti&s;m is
&s;uperior. In a republic, the tyrant is in our village, in our family;
perhaps, in a monarchy, he lives at a di&s;tance: the oppre&s;&s;ions of a
Monarch are gene|rally exerted only in the narrow &s;phere round him; the
oppre&s;&s;ions of the governors of a republic, though not &s;o flagrant, are
more univer&s;al: the Monarch is apt to commit great enormities, but they
&s;eldom reach the multitude at humble di&s;tance from the throne; the
republican De&s;pot oppre&s;&s;es the multitude that lies within the circle of
his influence: the Monarch terrifies me with great evils which I may never
feel; the De&s;pot actually loads me with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which I am
con&s;tantly obliged to &s;u&s;tain; and, in my opi|nion, it is much better to
be in danger of having my head chopped off, with an ax, once in my life, than
to have my leg gauled with a continual fetter.</P>
<P>Whatever were the rea&s;onings of the King, upon this &s;ubject, it
is certain, his actions were intended for the benefit of his &s;ubjects; but he
continued to rule them, upon the maxims of former princes, at a time that the
principles of the &s;ubjects were totally changed. The hou&s;e of commons
&s;eemed now to have thrown off all &s;ubordination; they not only ar|raigned 
<PB N="17" REF="20"> and attained almo&s;t all the King's mini|&s;ters;
particularly Laud, Strafford, Finch, and Winde|banck; but pa&s;&s;ed an act to
make that parliament con|tinual, until all grievances &s;hould be
redre&s;&s;ed. The King complied with every mea&s;ure, yet all his com|pliance
only &s;erved to increa&s;e their demands. The Earl of Strafford fir&s;t fell a
victim to their popular fury: the commons exhibited an accur&s;ation, of
twen|ty-eight articles again&s;t him; the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, That he
had attempted to extend the King's authority at home, and had been guilty of
&s;everal ex|actions in Ireland. The&s;e received the name of high trea&s;on,
and the people without demanded ju&s;tice. The managers for the hou&s;e of
commons pleaded, with vehemence, again&s;t him at the bar of the hou&s;e of
Lords, who were his Judges: they in&s;i&s;ted, that, though each article
&s;eperately did not amount to a proof, yet, the whole taken together carried
convic|tion. This is a method of arguing frequently u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h
courts of ju&s;tice, even to this day; and, perhaps, none can be more
erroneous; for almo&s;t every fal&s;hood may thus be defended by a
multiplici|ty of weak rea&s;ons. In this tumult of aggravation and clamour, the
Earl him&s;elf, who&s;e parts and wi&s;|dom had long been re&s;pected and
acknolwedged, &s;tood unmoved. He defended his innocence with all the
pre&s;ence of mind, judgment, and temper, that could be expected from innocence
and ability. His little children were placed near him, as he was thus
de|fending his own cau&s;e, and that of his ma&s;ter: after he had, with a long
and eloquent &s;peech, delivered extempore, confuted the accu&s;ation of his
enemies, he thus drew to a conclu&s;ion, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long;
longer than I &s;hould have done, but, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e dear pledges,
a &s;aint, in heaven, has left me.&mdash;</HI></Q>Upon this he pau&s;ed,
dropped a tear, look|ed upon his children, and then proceeded.&mdash;What I 
<PB N="18" REF="21"> forfeit, for my&s;elf, is a trifle; that my
indi&s;cretions &s;hould reach my po&s;terity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon
my infirmity.&mdash;Something I &s;hould have added, but am not able;
therefore, let it pa&s;s. And now, my Lords, for my&s;elf, I have long been
taught, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the affictions of this life are overpaid by
that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent; and &s;o, my Lords,
even &s;o, with the utmo&s;t tranquility I &s;ubmit my|&s;elf to your judgment.
Whether that judgment be life, or death.</HI> TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.</Q> His
eloquence and innocence &s;eemed to influence his Judges: the King him&s;elf
went to the hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;poke in his defence; but the &s;pirit of
the people was excited, and nothing, but his blood, would give them
&s;ati&s;|faction. He was condemned by both hou&s;es, and nothing now remained,
but for the King to give his con&s;ent to the bill of attainder. But his
con&s;ent &s;eemed of little con&s;equence; the limits of royalty were long
&s;ince broken down, and imminent dangers might attend his refu&s;al. While he
continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to behave, he received a
letter from the unfortunate Nobleman him&s;elf, de&s;iring that his life might
be made the &s;a|crifice of a mutual agreement between the King and the people;
adding, that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This noble in&s;tance
of gene|ro&s;ity was but ill repaid; the King was per&s;uaded to give his
con&s;ent; he &s;igned the fatal bill; Straf|ford was beheaded; and this taught
his &s;ubjects &s;oon after to &s;pill blood that was &s;till more
precious.</P>
<P>The whole kingdom now &s;eemed to be in a fer|ment; all the
petitions of parliament, which were in reality calculated to aba&s;e the King,
were not|with&s;tanding drawn up with the mo&s;t &s;eeming affec|tion and
obedience; they were con&s;tantly complain|ing in each of the&s;e of their
fears for the church, at the very time that they were them&s;elves labouring
its overthrow. Faction ran high. In the King's party <PB N="19" REF="22"> there
was an ill-projected and wor&s;e conducted de|&s;ign of keeping the prerogative
as much untouched as ever it had been in the reigns of the mo&s;t fortu|nate
and formidable Monarchs; in the oppo&s;ite par|ty a fixed re&s;olution of
turning the &s;tate into a re|public, and changing the government, of the
church into that of pre&s;bytery.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, the Papi&s;ts of Ire|land
fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the Engli&s;h yoke.
Religion and liberty often in&s;pire the mo&s;t attrocious actions; and they
did &s;o now. The Papi&s;ts took a re&s;olution, of which we find many horrid
examples in hi&s;tory. They at|tempted to cut off all the Prote&s;tants in that
king|dom at one blow. Not le&s;s than forty thou&s;and per|&s;ons fell a
&s;acrifice upon this occa&s;ion. In &s;uch a number of murders cruelty put on
a thou&s;and differ|ent &s;hapes; rapes, burnings, and tortures were
prac|ti&s;ed in every part of that mi&s;erable i&s;land; and all the
Prote&s;tants peri&s;hed who had not the good for|tune to make early
provi&s;ion for their &s;afety. Such was the &s;tate of Ireland then, and
&s;uch was England &s;hortly to be. The parliament took this opportunity to
blacken the King, as if he had given &s;anction to the Papi&s;ts, and
encouraged their barbarous de&s;ign; he vindicated him&s;elf with a zeal that
nothing but innocence could in&s;pire; and tried every method of
a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Ireland. He even demanded
&s;uccours from the parliament of Scotland to relieve the Iri&s;h
Prote&s;tants; but they remitted him to the parliament of England, as Ireland
lay more immediately under their protection. The Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons
&s;ent but feeble &s;uccours to a peo|ple they pretended to deplore, and gave
it as a pre|text, that the government at home was in danger.</P>
<P>They now proceeded to what they long laboured at, to e&s;tabli&s;h a
republic, and de&s;troy the rites of the <PB N="20" REF="23"> church of
England. They &s;ignified to the King, that it was fit to have a privy council
only of their appointing. Three members of the hou&s;e of com|mons pre&s;ented
this reque&s;t on their knees. The King was plea&s;ed to grant all. Oliver
Cromwell, who was then in the hou&s;e of commons, was heard to declare, that,
if this reque&s;t was rejected, he would &s;ell his e&s;tate, which was then
but &s;mall, and retire out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Hitherto, it is probable, both &s;ides were actuated rather by
principle than ambition. The Bi&s;hops had hitherto adhered clo&s;ely to the
King; they were not only expelled the hou&s;e of Lords, but, upon
remon|&s;trating again&s;t this uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ure, were accu&s;ed by
the hou&s;e of commons of high trea&s;on, and ten of them &s;ent to the Tower.
This &s;pirit of epidemic rage was not confined to both hou&s;es of parliament
alone; the populace daily &s;urrounded the place of &s;itting, and, with
tumultuous cries, demand|ed ju&s;tice. The apprentices, the common-council, and
the citizens of London were foremo&s;t in this &s;truggle for liberty, as they
thought it; their prin|ciples were &s;incere; for the motives of a mob, though
often wrong, are always hone&s;t. In this conte&s;t the Pre&s;byterians, and
Cardinal Richelieu of France, were ever intriguing; both de&s;ired a civil war,
the one willing to depre&s;s the great, the other to humble the kingdom.</P>
<P>In this decline of the royal authority, the King was per&s;uaded to
take a &s;tep which was fatal to his intere&s;ts. By the advice of Lord Digby,
one of his mini&s;ters, he went him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of commons, and
accu&s;ed five of its members of high trea&s;on. The&s;e were the leading
members of the hou&s;e, whom he thus ventured to call in que&s;tion; namely,
Lord Kimbolton, Mr. Hollis, Sir Arthur Ha&s;lerig, Mr. Pym, Mr. Hampden, and
Mr. Strode. He &s;at, for &s;ome time, in the &s;peaker's chair, to &s;ee if
the ac|cu&s;ed <PB N="21" REF="24"> were pre&s;ent; but they had e&s;caped a
few mi|nutes before his entry; and the hou&s;e of commons was re&s;olved to
&s;upport the cau&s;e. Di&s;appointed, perplexed, unknowing whom to rely on,
the King went next to the common-council of the city, and made his complaint to
them; the common-council only an&s;wered by aggravating his former
mi&s;conduct. From thence he went to Wind&s;or, where, reflecting upon the
ra&s;hne&s;s of his former proceeding, he wrote to the parliament, informing
them, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that he de&s;i&s;ted from his proceedings
agin&s;t the accu&s;ed members, and a&s;|&s;uring the parliament, that upon all
occa&s;ions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his
crown.</HI></Q> His violence (as a fine writer remarks) had fir&s;t ren|dered
him hateful to his common,s and his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion now contemptible.</P>
<P>The commons had already &s;tripped the King of al|mo&s;t all his
privileges; the power of appointing go|vernors, generals, and levying armies,
&s;till remain|ed. They therefore proceeded to petition, that the Tower might
be put into their hands; that Hull, Port&s;mouth, and the fleet, &s;hould be
commanded by per&s;ons of their chu&s;ing. The&s;e reque&s;ts were, at fir&s;t,
conte&s;ted, and then complied with; at la&s;t the commons de&s;ired to have a
militia rai&s;ed, and go|verned by &s;uch officers and commanders as they
&s;hould nominate, under a pretext of &s;ecuring them from the Iri&s;h
Papi&s;ts, whom they affected to be in dread of. This was depriving the King of
even the &s;hadow of his former power; but they had gone too far now to recede,
and feared leaving him any power, as knowing them&s;elves the fir&s;t objects
on which its vengeance might be exerci&s;ed. He was willing to grant the
rai&s;ing a militia, but in&s;i&s;ted upon giving it commanders; the parliament
de&s;ired to command it for an appointed time; but the King, at la&s;t
pro|voked to re&s;entment, cried, they &s;hould not com|mand it, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>no not for an hour.</HI></Q> This peremptory
refu&s;al <PB N="22" REF="25"> broke off all further treaty, and both &s;ides
were now to have recour&s;e to arms.</P>
<P>Charles retired to York, and the Queen went over to Holland, to
rai&s;e money upon the crown jewels, and provide ammunition and forces. The
parliament, in the mean time, were not idle; they knew their &s;trength and
popularity, and publi&s;hed propo&s;als for bringing in money or plate for the
de|fence of the kingdom. But, though each &s;ide were prepared for war, yet
they took every precaution to lay the blame of the fir&s;t infraction of peace
on each other. The King offered propo&s;als to the commons which he knew they
would not accept; and they, in return, offered him nineteen propo&s;itions,
which, if complied with, would render him entirely &s;ub&s;er|vient to their
commands. Their import was, that the privy council, the principal officers of
&s;tate, the governors of the King's children, forts, ca&s;tles, fleet, armies,
&s;hould be all appointed or governed by par|liament; that Papi&s;ts &s;hould

Hotham, a &s;itting member of the hou&s;e of commons, governor of Hull. In this
city there was a large magazine of arms, ammunition, and provi&s;ions. The
King, &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the place, was de&s;irous of &s;ecuring
it for him&s;elf; he therefore approached the gates with three hun|dred
hor&s;e, and demanded entrance. Hotham &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome appearance of
re&s;pect to his &s;ove|reign, land, on his knees, refu&s;ed to admit him.
Di&s;loyalty is ever timid in the beginning.</P>
<P>Manife&s;toes, on one &s;ide and the other, were now di&s;per&s;ed
through the whole kingdom, and the people were univer&s;ally divided into two
factions, that went by the names of Royali&s;ts and Round-heads. The King
ordered the Nobility to attend his per&s;on; he procured the great &s;eal from
London, and erected his &s;tandard at Nottingham. The people, in general,
&s;eemed to have lo&s;t all re&s;pect to his per&s;on and go|vernment; the laws
promulgated by parliament, without the &s;anction of the great &s;eal, were
ob|&s;erved with due obedience; and the royal &s;tandard was &s;carce followed
by any except a few militia. At length, however, with the &s;uccours
furni&s;hed by his Queen, and the pre&s;ents of the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford,
and his Clergy, he rai&s;ed an army of about fourteen thou&s;and men, commanded
by Prince Ru|pert, a man of courage and &s;ome experience. The parliament,
which di&s;po&s;ed of the money of the nation, had one &s;till more numerous,
commanded <PB N="24" REF="27"> by the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, who fought from
principle, and who only wi&s;hed to bring the King to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>When the King advanced from Nottingham, and approached near
Shrew&s;bury, he drew up his little army, and made them a &s;peech: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I promi&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he to the &s;oldiers,
<HI>in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his ble&s;&s;ing and
protection, that I will ever defend the Prote&s;tant religion, and in that
religion am re|&s;olved to live and die. The laws of the land, and the rights
of my &s;ubjects, &s;hall ever be the mea&s;ure of my go|vernment; and, if
Heaven pro&s;pers this little army rai&s;ed for their King's defence, I
promi&s;e to rule by parliaments alone, and by every equitable
admini&s;tration. When I fail in the&s;e particulars, then let me be abandoned
of men; and in this re&s;olution I hope for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all good
men, end am confident of the protection of Providence.</HI></Q></P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex, on the other hand, was re&s;olved to &s;et up his
head-quarters at Worce&s;ter, and await the King; where, in a few days, a
&s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued in favour of the Royali&s;ts; and the battle of
Edge-hill, fought &s;ome time after, &s;eemed to confirm the King's
&s;upe|riority. The Queen had brought him &s;oldiers from Holland, with
ammunition and arms, and immediately departed in order to furni&s;h more. Yet
&s;till the par|liament was not di&s;couraged; their demands &s;eemed to
increa&s;e in proportion to their lo&s;&s;es; and, as they were defeated in the
field, they grew more ob&s;tinate in the cabinet. They condemned of high
trea&s;on &s;uch governors of towns as gave up their fortre&s;&s;es to the
King; while he, on the contrary, offered new terms of peace upon every
advantage. But, though his de&s;ire to &s;pare his &s;ubjects was laudable, as
a man, yet his long negotiations were faulty, as a warrior; he wa&s;ted that
time in altercation and propo&s;al, which &s;hould have been employed in
vi|gorous exertions in the field. Upon the whole, his fir&s;t campaign &s;eemed
to promi&s;e him &s;ucce&s;s; his <PB N="25" REF="28"> generals were mo&s;tly
victorious, and his army far &s;uperior to the enemy in point of di&s;cipline.
On the &s;ide of the parliament, the great Hampden was &s;lain in the battle of
Chaldgrave-field; and on the other hand, on the King's part, the gallant Lord
Faulk|land was killed at the battle of Newbury. The&s;e were the two
greate&s;t, brave&s;t, and wi&s;e&s;t men of their time, who thus fell, as if,
by the kindne&s;s of Providence, to prevent their &s;eeing the mi&s;eries, and
the &s;laughter in which their country was &s;hortly to be involved.</P>
<P>Hampden was the per&s;on who had refu&s;ed paying &s;hip-money, and
with&s;tood the power of the crown; his inflexible integrity gained him the
e&s;teem even of his enemies; and his humanity and benevolence, the affection
of all that knew him more intimately.</P>
<P>But Faulkland was &s;till a greater character than he. He added to
Hampden's &s;evere principles all the politene&s;s and elegance then known in
Europe. He had with&s;tood the King while he &s;aw him mak|ing an ill u&s;e of
his power; but, when he perceived the de&s;ign of the parliament to change
religion, he changed his &s;ide, and &s;tedfa&s;tly attached him&s;elf to the
crown. From the beginning of the civil war his natural chearfulne&s;s and
vivacity grew clouded, and he became &s;ad, pale, and negligent of his
per|&s;on; the morning of the battle it was &s;een he de|&s;ired to die, and he
profe&s;&s;ed that the mi&s;eries of his country had already almo&s;t broken
his heart. He added, that he was weary of the times, and &s;hould leave them
before night. He was &s;hot with a mu&s;|quet in the belly, and his body was
the next morn|ing found among an heap of the &s;lain. His writings, his
ju&s;tice, and his courage, de&s;erved &s;uch a death of glory; and they lound
it. If there be happine&s;s in death, it mu&s;t be in &s;uch an end, falling in
battle for our King and our principles.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"> Each battle &s;erved only to weaken the royal
party, and to unite the parliament more &s;trongly together; the King and his
followers were held together only by &s;ecular motives; the parliament had long
been actuated by one &s;till &s;tronger, that of religion; this had hitherto
been the &s;ecret &s;pring of all their com|motions, and now they fairly threw
by the ma&s;k, united them&s;elves to the church of Scotland, and &s;igned the
&s;olemn league and covenant, which e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Puritani&s;m, and laid the
foundation of a new republic. The King, to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the
We&s;tmin&s;ter parliament, called one at Oxford, where it a&s;&s;embled; and
England now &s;aw what it had ne|ver before &s;een, two parliaments &s;itting
at one and the &s;ame time. From this partial parliament he re|ceived &s;ome
&s;upplies; after which it was prorogued, and never after convened. The war
went on with its u&s;ual fury, and &s;kirmi&s;hes on both &s;ides were
fre|quent, which &s;erved to de&s;olate the kingdom with|out deciding victory.
Each county joined that &s;ide to which it was addicted from motives of
conviction, intere&s;t or fear; while &s;ome ob&s;erved a perfect neutrality.
Several frequently petitioned for peace, the wi&s;e and the good were mo&s;t
earne&s;t in this cry; but what particularly de&s;erved remark was, the
at|tempt of the women of London, who, to the num|ber of two or three
thou&s;and, went in a body to the hou&s;e of commons, earne&s;tly demanding a
peace: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Give us tho&s;e traitors,</HI> &s;aid they,
<HI>that are again&s;t peace; give them, that we may tear them in
pieces.</HI></Q> The guards found &s;ome difficulty in quelling this
in&s;urrection, and one or two women lo&s;t their lives in the fray.</P>
<P>It is both tedious and unimproving to de&s;cribe all the combats,
the battles, the &s;kirmi&s;hes, that every day pa&s;&s;ed between either
&s;ide. What towns were be|&s;ieged and taken, how many killed in fight, or
what numbers died by the hand of the executioner; every civil war pre&s;ents
the &s;ame picture to the imagina|tion; <PB N="27" REF="30"> and this was
aggravated with all the mi&s;eries of rage, re&s;entment, and de&s;pair. All
were from principle earne&s;tly employed in de&s;troying the con&s;ti|tution;
there were none of tho&s;e refined under&s;tand|ings, who, di&s;engaged from
the prejudices of party, improved the univer&s;al prejudice of the time to
ac|quire dominion for them&s;elves; all were &s;eriou&s;ly, earne&s;tly, and
blindly engaged in the favourite pur|&s;uit. The genius of the times was great
but irregular.</P>
<P>Among the number who mo&s;t &s;everely felt the in|dignation of the
commons, was the famous William Laud, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; he had been
im|pri&s;oned in the Tower, at the time when nine more of the Bi&s;hops were
&s;ent there upon remon&s;trating to the Lords again&s;t the &s;everity of the
lower hou&s;e. When he was brought to the bar, in order to make his defence, he
&s;poke &s;everal hours with that cou|rage which is the re&s;ult of innocence
and integrity. The Lords, his Judges, were willing to acquit him; but the
commons were determined upon his death, and over-ruled all remon&s;trances made
in his favour. When brought to the &s;caffold, this noble divine, without any
apparent terror, made the people a long &s;peech; he told them, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had examined his heart, and thanked God
that he found no &s;ins there which de&s;erved the death he was going to
&s;uffer. The King had been traduced by &s;ome, as labouring to introduce
Popery; but that he be|lieved him as &s;ound a Prote&s;tant as any man in the
kingdom; and as for parliaments, though he di&s;liked the conduct of one or
two, yet he never de&s;igned to change the laws of the country, or the
Prote&s;tant religion."</Q> After he had prayed for a &s;hort &s;pace, the
executioner did his office at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e
blow. This man &s;eemed born for a better on fate and better times; but all
di&s;tinctions of right and wrong were now lo&s;t in mutual animo&s;ity; and in
general the be&s;t characters on both &s;ides were tho&s;e <PB N="28" REF="31">
who fell victims to civil fury. He was learned, up|right, and &s;incere; humble
in his private deport|ment, but attached to trifling ceremonies, and ready to
lo&s;e his life rather than give them up.</P>
<P>The liturgy was, by a public act, aboli&s;hed the day he died, as if
he had been the only ob&s;tacle to its former removal. The church of England
was rendered completely Pre&s;byterian, to the great &s;ati&s;|faction of the
Scots, and numbers of the citizens of London. An ordinance was e&s;tabli&s;hed,
by which there &s;hould be one day in the week appointed as a fa&s;t, and the
money which was thus &s;pared to the family, was to be paid in &s;upport of the
common cau&s;e. Thus &s;trengthened, the parliament &s;eem|ed capable of
carrying on their de&s;igns in an arbitra|ry manner; they had the Scotch to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them; they profe&s;&s;ed only one religion, and were united with
the bonds of mutual danger. However, from the mo|ment they came to be all
ranked under the denomi|nation of Pre&s;byterians, they began again to
&s;epa|rate into new parties, as if divi&s;ions were nece&s;&s;ary to the
exi&s;tence of this parliament; one part of the hou&s;e were Pre&s;byterians,
&s;trictly &s;o called; the other Independants, a new &s;ect that had lately
been intro|duced, and gained ground &s;urpri&s;ingly. The differ|ence between
the&s;e two &s;ects would hardly be worth mentioning, did not their religious
opinions influ|ence their political conduct. The church of Eng|land, which was
now totally aboli&s;hed, had appoint|ed Bi&s;hops and a book of common prayer;
the Pre&s;byterians exclaimed again&s;t both; they were for having the church
governed by clergymen elected by the people. The Independants went yet &s;till
far|ther, and excluded all clergy; they maintained that every man might pray in
public, exhort his audi|ence, and explain the &s;criptures; but their chief
dif|ference lay in acknowledging no &s;ubordination in &s;e|cular employments,
and attempting to maintain an <PB N="29" REF="32"> ideal equality, to which
they ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that every man was born. Were &s;uch a plan of
govern|ment practicable, it would no doubt be the mo&s;t happy; but the wi&s;e
and powerful mu&s;t ever govern over ignorance and debility, and the bad
&s;ucce&s;s of their &s;chemes, &s;oon after carried into execution, &s;hewed
how ill adapted they were to human infir|mity. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, with
an high opinion of their &s;peculative &s;cheme, they behaved with that
mo|ro&s;e and &s;ullen carriage which is ever the re&s;ult of narrow manners
and &s;olitary thinking. They &s;e|cretly laboured the aba&s;ement of the
Pre&s;byterians, yet joined them in their efforts to depre&s;s the King.</P>
<P>Charles, now perceiving the parliaments of England and Scotland
united again&s;t him, and fearing to fall under their united efforts, thought
proper to make a truce with the Papi&s;ts of Ireland, in order to bring ever
the Engli&s;h troops who &s;erved in that kingdom. By this means he not only
had many of the Engli&s;h troops that &s;erved there, but al&s;o &s;everal of
the native Iri&s;h who came to increa&s;e his army. It was then the parliament
complained with truth of his employ|ing Papi&s;ts in his &s;ervice, and &s;till
farther extended their reproach by &s;aying that he encouraged them to re|bel.
The&s;e troops, however, only &s;erved to procure the hatred of his &s;ubjects,
without &s;trengthening his army. They were totally routed by Fairfax, one of
the generals of the parliament army, and &s;laughtered without mercy after a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It was &s;aid, that &s;everal Iri&s;h women were found among
the &s;lain, who with long knives did con&s;iderable execution; but the
animo&s;ity of the Engli&s;h again&s;t tho&s;e wretches, at that time, might
have given ri&s;e to the calumny.</P>
<P>One misfortune now &s;eemed to follow clo&s;e upon another: Prince
Rupert, who had long &s;u&s;tained the honour of the royal arms, was defeated
at York, and his army di&s;per&s;ed by Fairfax. Charles had retired to Oxford;
his pre&s;ent danger excited his friends to <PB N="30" REF="33"> new efforts;
he levied new forces, and had &s;ome &s;light &s;ucce&s;s. But this appearance
of good fortune did not continue. His army was turbulent and &s;e|ditious; that
of the parliament every day improved in di&s;cipline, and obeyed from
principle. Among in&s;tances of this nature was that act called the
<HI>&s;elf-denying ordinance,</HI> by which it was re&s;olved, that no member
of the hou&s;e of commons &s;hould have a command in the army. The rea&s;ons
a&s;&s;igned for this were &s;pecious, and perhaps &s;incere. It was done to
prevent the parliament's wi&s;hing for a continu|ance of the war, in order to
enjoy a continuing &s;hare of authority. The former generals were there|fore
changed; the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, Denbigh, and Man|che&s;ter gave up their
commi&s;&s;ions, and Fairfax, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cromwell,
new-modelled the army without any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was the general opinion, that this new altera|tion would enfeeble
the parliament army, but the event proved otherwi&s;e; they were, after this,
every-where victorious. Both armies met near Na&s;eby. The King, who commanded
the main body of his own troops, &s;hewed him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion a
coura|geous general, encouraging his &s;oldiers where giving way, and rallying
them in per&s;on when broken. The enemy, however, was victorious; wherever
Cromwell fought, he brought conque&s;t and terror; and the defeat of the royal
army was principally owing to him. This fatal blow the King could never after
recover. All his infantry were &s;o &s;cattered that the enemy took as many
pri&s;oners as they plea&s;|ed; his baggage, and cabinet in which his mo&s;t
&s;ecret papers were contained, fell into the hands of his pur|&s;uers; and
yet, after all, there were not above &s;ix hundred men &s;lain upon the field
of battle.</P>
<P>It was now that Cromwell's courage and genius began to appear; he
had hitherto been only a tur|bulent &s;peaker in the hou&s;e of commons, and
the <PB N="31" REF="34"> leader of a regiment in the army. But he now
di&s;|covered talents greater than his employments, and his pre&s;ent
&s;ucce&s;s opened to him the pro&s;pects of am|bition, which he never after
lo&s;t &s;ight of. Hi&s;torians &s;eldom di&s;tingui&s;h properly in the
changes to be found in the &s;ame character; it is probable Cromwell be|gan to
act in the &s;tate with principles of conviction and &s;incerity; but, new
occurrences ari&s;ing, his &s;oul was not proof to the allurements of fortune;
he gave way to her &s;educing call. Had he been on the op|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ide,
he might have di&s;played &s;urpri&s;ing in|&s;tances of con&s;tancy and
integrity; but, happening to be victorious, he became a tyrant and u&s;urper,
and bathed his country with royal blood.</P>
<P>Cromwell was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of apparent humility and internal
pride. This is ju&s;t the character which Machiavel de&s;cribes for a
&s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urper. He was originally the &s;on of a private gentleman of
a moderate fortune, who had &s;ome years before at|tempted leaving the kingdom
upon a principle of re|ligion, but was prevented by the King. This reli|gious
deportment Cromwell ever inviolably pre&s;erv|ed; it &s;ecured him an
a&s;cendancy in the hou&s;e of commons, where the majority were
enthu&s;ia&s;ts; it gained him the affections of Fairfax the general, who was
courageous, ignorant, and &s;incere. It acquired him the love of the army,
where his pre&s;ence was coveted; and he alone was permitted to unite the
military and civil employments in his per&s;on, for he had a &s;eat in the
hou&s;e while he was a colonel in the field. But he was &s;till re&s;olved
farther to &s;trengthen his intere&s;ts by attaching the Independants privately
to his &s;ide; they increa&s;ed in numbers and power by his means, and he, in
return, found them re&s;olute and per&s;evering friends.</P>
<P>The battle of Na&s;eby &s;eemed fatal to the intere&s;ts of the
King; and Fairfax and Cromwell availed them&s;elves of the circum&s;tances that
offered. Every city that they <PB N="32" REF="35"> appeared before capitulated.
The young Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II, participated in the
misfortunes of his father, and fled to the i&s;land of Scilly. The King drew
the &s;hattered remains of his army into Oxford, and once more demanded peace.
But, if he could not obtain it in the pro&s;|perous &s;tate of his affairs, it
was not likely that he could now &s;ucceed in his de&s;ires after a defeat. The
hou&s;e of commons in&s;ulted his misfortunes. His let|ters to the Queen were
publi&s;hed, with tho&s;e ill|natured remarks and railleries which none but the
vicious are capable of making. To be at once mer|ry and malicious is the &s;ign
of a corrupt heart and mean under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The King, after having taken every mea&s;ure that he thought could
procure peace, without effect, now &s;aw him&s;elf &s;hut up in Oxford, a place
almo&s;t with|out any fortifications, and every day in danger of falling into
the power of a fierce and exa&s;perated party. In &s;uch a &s;ituation he
therefore was obliged to chu&s;e the lea&s;t of two evils, and to deliver
him|&s;elf up to the Scotch army, rather than the Engli&s;h, as he expected to
find le&s;s animo&s;ity in the former. The Scotch officers had made him &s;ome
general pro|mi&s;es, grounded, probably, upon their hopes of his compliance
with every reque&s;t they &s;hould make. He &s;ent them word of his intention
to come to their army; and they promi&s;ed to receive him, and pro|vide for his
&s;afety. Upon this precarious a&s;&s;urance the King left Oxford, and,
travelling through by|ways and ob&s;cure places, arrived at the Scotch army in
nine days. From that moment he cea&s;ed to be free. The Scotch began to
negotiate with the Eng|li&s;h army, carried their royal pri&s;oner about from
one place to another, and, at length, upon con&s;ider|ation of being paid the
arrears due for their &s;ervice in England, which amounted to two hundred
thou&s;and pounds, they delivered up their King, and returned 
<PB N="33" REF="36"> home laden with the reproaches of all good men, and the
internal conviction of their own ba&s;ene&s;s. From this period till the
u&s;urpation of Cromwell, the con&s;titution was convul&s;ed with all the
di&s;trac|tions of guilt and party. When the kingly power was aboli&s;hed, the
parliament then took up the au|thority; but they were &s;oon to lay it down in
turn, and &s;ubmit to a military democracy; a new form of government, which,
like all other democracies, was turbulent, feeble, and bloody.</P>

<P>THE civil war was now over; the army of Scotland, being paid the
reward of perfidy, returned to its own country. The parliament had now no enemy
to fear, except tho&s;e very troops which had fought their battles with
&s;ucce&s;s. You have been already informed, that this army, by a political
&s;troke of Cromwell, was rendered indepen|dent of the parliament, and all its
generals di&s;abled from &s;itting there. The commons therefore were now
willing to get rid of it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, well knowing that, if the
army continued, in&s;tead of re|ceiving laws, it would pre&s;ume to dictate.
They therefore pa&s;&s;ed a vote, by which it was ordained, that a part of it
&s;hould be di&s;banded, and another part of it &s;ent over into Ireland. It
may ea&s;ily be imagined that Cromwell would not &s;uffer this. Now was the
cri&s;is of his greatne&s;s, and he &s;eized the op|portunity; he formed a
council of officers, and an|other of common &s;oldiers, called Agitators, who
were appointed to enquire into the grievances of the army, and lay them before
the parliament. The very <PB N="34" REF="37"> &s;ame conduct which had formerly
pa&s;&s;ed between the parliament and King was now put in practice be|tween the
army and parliament. As the commons granted every reque&s;t the army ro&s;e in
their demands; the&s;e accu&s;ed the army of mutiny and &s;edition, and tho&s;e
retorted the accu&s;ation, by alledging a mani|fe&s;t de&s;ign in the
parliament to rule alone.</P>
<P>The King had been confined &s;ince he came into the power of the
Engli&s;h, at Holmby ca&s;tle; the ar|my were re&s;olved to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his per&s;on, and &s;ent one Joyce, a cornet, who from a
taylor was be|come an officer, to take the King by force, and bring him a
pri&s;oner to Newmarket. This commi&s;|&s;ion he executed with intrepidity and
di&s;patch. It was in vain that the commons, now without power, complained of
this in&s;olence; the army, in&s;tead of being awed by their menaces, marched
towards Lon|don; and now, in turn, pre&s;cribed laws to their employers.
Cromwell, willing to give all his in|ju&s;tice the appearance of rectitude,
cau&s;ed eleven members of the hou&s;e of commons to be accu&s;ed. The&s;e were
the mo&s;t powerful and leading &s;peakers, which &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed the
members, that, willing to appea&s;e the army at any rate, they writ to the
ge|neral, that they were ready to receive any particular charge again&s;t
&s;uch as fell under his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This was an overture for peace, but pre-eminence was what the army
aimed at; in&s;tead therefore of being plea&s;ed at this conde&s;cen&s;ion, the
general turn|ed their accu&s;ation into a general complaint, and tried every
method to provoke a quarrel, which the others endeavoured to evade. The
citizens of Lon|don, at length, opened their eyes; they now &s;aw the
con&s;titution effectually de&s;troyed; they &s;aw an oppre&s;&s;ive parliament
now &s;ubjected to a more oppre&s;|&s;ive army; they perceived their religion
aboli&s;hed, their King a captive, and their people expo&s;ed to the wor&s;t of
&s;lavery.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38"> In this exigence the common-council
a&s;&s;embled the militia of the city, the works were manned, and a manife&s;to
publi&s;hed, aggravating the ho&s;tile inten|tions of the army. The hou&s;e of
commons was not le&s;s divided than the &s;tate: one part was for encou|raging
the citizens to proceed, while the re&s;t, with the two &s;peakers at their
head, was for the army. The &s;lighte&s;t divi&s;ions, in &s;uch a &s;ituation,
are &s;oon attended with violent con&s;equences. The commons &s;eparated, the
&s;peakers, with &s;ixty-two members, quitted the hou&s;e to &s;eek protection
from the army, while tho&s;e who remained behind gave orders, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, as if they had power to enforce obedience.</P>
<P>Their a&s;&s;umed power, however, continued but a &s;hort time, for
the army, with the &s;peakers at their head, &s;oon approached the city. Fear,
therefore, compelled the common-council to concur in mea|&s;ures which they
tacitly di&s;approved. They opened their gates to the general, who, attended by
the two &s;peakers and the re&s;t of the members, repaired to their
re&s;pective habitations. The parliament, thus over-awed, gave up the command
of the Tower to general Fairfax, and ordered him the thanks of both hou&s;es
for having di&s;obeyed their commands.</P>
<P>It &s;till remained to di&s;po&s;e of the King, who had been &s;ent
pri&s;oner to Hampton-court. The In|dependants, at the head of whom was
Cromwell, and the Pre&s;byterians, in the name of either hou&s;e, treated
&s;eparately with him in private; he even had hopes that in the&s;e &s;truggles
for power he might be cho&s;en mediator in the di&s;pute, and expected that the
&s;tate, at la&s;t, &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries of anarchy, like a froward
child, hu&s;hed by its own importuni|ties, would &s;ettle under its former
tranquil con&s;ti|tution. But he was &s;oon undeceived, when he found the army
and the generals ma&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in the
di&s;pute; and when, as he had hitherto been u&s;ed with &s;ome 
<PB N="36" REF="39"> degree of re&s;pect, upon their prevailing, he &s;aw
him|&s;elf treated with very little deference or con&s;ideration. He therefore
re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;afety by flight, and, at|tended by two of his
courtiers, fled from his con|finement, and travelled on hor&s;eback all night
to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in order to embark for France, leaving behind him a letter
to both hou&s;es of parliament. His u&s;ual fortunes, however, &s;till attended
him here; no &s;hip was in readine&s;s at the place appointed, and he had no
other method left, but to tru&s;t to the ge|nero&s;ity of the Governor of the
I&s;le of Wight for protection. Colonel Hammond was then in that command; a
creature of Cromwell, who had been placed there by the intere&s;t of John
Hampden, whom we have &s;een &s;uch an oppo&s;er of the King. His Ma|je&s;ty's
attendants, who&s;e names were A&s;hburnham and Berkeley, went to talk with the
Governor upon this important occa&s;ion, who, in&s;tead of promi&s;ing the
protection required, only returned an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, and de&s;ired to be
conducted to the King. Upon this all three went together to the hou&s;e, where
the unfortunate Monarch expected their ar|rival; but Hammond &s;taid below.
When A&s;hburn|ham informed his Maje&s;ty that Hammond was come to wait upon
him, but that he had given no promi&s;e for protection, the King, who had now
found almo&s;t all the world unfaithful, could not help crying out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O Jack, thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> undone me.</HI></Q> A&s;hburnham bur&s;t into a &s;hower of tears,
and offered to kill Hammond that moment with his own hand. The humane Monarch
would not permit this. Hammond was brought up, and the King being compelled to
follow him to Cari&s;brook ca&s;tle was once more made a pri&s;oner, and
treated by Hammond with only the outward ap|pearances of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the mean time the parliament continued every day to grow more
feeble, and more factious; the army more powerful, and better united among each
<PB N="37" REF="40"> other. Cromwell had taken every precaution to
e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a &s;ubordination among his troops, as was nece&s;&s;ary
to conduct them with ea&s;e, and invi|gorate his proceedings. But his views
were in &s;ome danger of being controverted, at this juncture, by a new and
unheard-of confederacy. The Indepen|dants were for having no &s;ubordination in
govern|ment. A &s;et of men called Levellers now aro&s;e, who declared
again&s;t any other governor than Chri&s;t. They declared that all degrees
&s;hould be levelled, and an equality univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in titles
and e&s;tates. They pre&s;ented &s;everal petitions, and car|ried their
in&s;olence to an immea&s;urable pitch. Cromwell at once &s;aw that he was now
upon the point of lo&s;ing all the fruits of his former &s;chemes and dangers,
and dreaded this new faction &s;till the more, as they turned his own pretended
principles again&s;t him&s;elf: thus finding all at &s;take, he was
re|&s;olved, by one re&s;olute blow, to di&s;per&s;e the faction, or peri&s;h
in the attempt. Having intimation that the Levellers were to meet at a certain
place, he unexpectedly appeared before the terrified a&s;&s;embly, at the head
of his red regiment, which had been hitherto invincible. He demanded, in the
name of God, what their a&s;&s;embly and murmurings would be at; and, receiving
an in&s;olent an&s;wer, he laid two of the mo&s;t remarkable dead upon the
ground with his own hands. The guards di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t, he cau&s;ed
&s;everal of them to be hanged upon the &s;pot, &s;ent others pri&s;oners to
London, and thus di&s;per&s;ed a faction, no otherwi&s;e criminal than in
having fol|lowed his own example.</P>
<P>This action &s;erved &s;till more to increa&s;e his power in the
camp, in the parliament, and in the city. Fairfax, now become a Lord, was
nominally general, but Cromwell was inve&s;ted with all the power of the army.
The King, a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight, &s;till continued to negotiate a
peace; while the parlia|ment <PB N="38" REF="41"> &s;aw no other method of
de&s;troying the mili|tary power which them&s;elves had rai&s;ed, but by
oppo&s;ing to it that of the King. Frequent propo&s;i|tions therefore
pa&s;&s;ed between the captive Monarch and the commons; but the great
ob&s;tacle, their in|&s;i&s;ting upon de&s;troying Epi&s;copacy, &s;till
defeated every mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Scotch, a&s;hamed of having been thought to
have &s;old their King, rai&s;ed an army in his favour. Many of the young
nobility in Eng|land &s;econded their intentions; the King's de&s;perate
affairs once more began to wear a favourable a&s;pect, which Cromwell
perceiving, led his veteran army to cer|tain victory. Succe&s;s &s;till
&s;eemed to back his crimes; he defeated their forces entirely at Pre&s;ton,
and took the Duke of Hamilton, their general, pri&s;oner. Fair-fax, on the
other hand, was equally &s;ucce&s;sful in Kent and E&s;&s;ex; the in&s;urgents
having retired into the city of Colche&s;ter, which declared for the King, he
blocked them up, and, having compelled them to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, he
treated them with that in|humanity for which the republican army was at that
time remarkable.</P>
<P>The parli ment &s;till continued to treat with the King, and,
apprehending more from the de&s;igns of their generals than the attempts of
their Monarch, &s;eemed in earne&s;t, for the fir&s;t time, in their
negotia|tions; but it was now too late; the army &s;oon re|turned crowned with
their accu&s;tomed &s;ucce&s;s, and with furious remon&s;trances demanded
ju&s;tice upon the King. They accu&s;ed him as the cau&s;e of all the
misfortunes of the kingdom, and in&s;i&s;ted that his par|tizans and favourites
&s;hould &s;hare with him in his public puni&s;hment. This remon&s;trance was
&s;oon af|ter backed by petitions from the garri&s;ons di&s;per&s;ed over
different parts of the kingdom, and the counties of Somer&s;et and Norfolk
concurred in the &s;ame de|mand. Fairfax, being influenced by Cromwell, and 
<PB N="39" REF="42"> not perceiving that he was the tool of his crafty
collegue, transferred his royal pri&s;oner from the I&s;le of Wight to Hur&s;t
ca&s;tle. The parliament complained of this arbitrary proceeding, but their
remon&s;trances were now but empty &s;ound. They began to i&s;&s;ue ordinances
for a more effectual oppo|&s;ition; but they received a me&s;&s;age from
Cromwell, that he intended paying them a vi&s;it next day with his army, and in
the mean time ordered them to rai&s;e him upon the city of London forty
thou&s;and pounds. Affrighted at the approaching danger, they complied with his
demand; and, in the mean time, the ge|neral with his army came and took up his
quarters in the &s;kirts of the city. The commons &s;till pro|ceeded in the
treaty with the King, but this Crom|well was re&s;olved to oppo&s;e: they
voted, that the carrying the King pri&s;oner to Hur&s;t ca&s;tle was with|out
the advice or con&s;ent of the hou&s;e. To puni&s;h them for this, Cromwell
placed guards round their hou&s;e, and made tho&s;e members pri&s;oners whom he
judged mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to his de&s;igns. One of his colonels, who&s;e name
was Pride, having a paper of names in his hand, &s;eized upon one-and-forty,
and &s;ent them to the Court of Wards, where they were kept under guard.
The&s;e were Pre&s;byterians, the original authors of all the troubles, and who
now fell victims to the &s;ide they had e&s;pou&s;ed. The next day an hundred
more of the members were denied entrance; and that part of the hou&s;e which
now remained was entirely compo&s;ed of a &s;mall body of Independants,
ludicrou&s;ly called the Rump. The&s;e &s;oon voted, that the tran&s;actions of
the hou&s;e, a few days before, were illegal; and that the general's conduct
was ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This parliament, if it now de&s;erves the name, was nothing but a
medley of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure citizens, the &s;laves of the army, the officers
of which, being them&s;elves members, ruled all their proceedings. It 
<PB N="40" REF="43"> was now therefore unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved in this
&s;editious a&s;&s;embly to erect an High Court of Ju&s;|tice, with power to
try the King for trea&s;on again&s;t the kingdom. For form-&s;ake they
de&s;ired the concurrence of the few remaining Lords in the other hou&s;e; but
even here there &s;till was virtue enough left unanimou&s;ly to reject &s;o
horrid a propo|&s;al. This no way abated the ardour of the com|mons; they voted
that the concurrence of the hou&s;e of Lords was unnece&s;&s;ary; they declared
that all power was originally derived from the people; a declara|tion true in
it&s;elf, but which they wre&s;ted to the mo&s;t dete&s;table purpo&s;es.
Colonel Harri&s;on, the &s;on of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the King
from Hur&s;t ca&s;tle to Wind&s;or. When he arrived there, the council of war
ordained, that he &s;hould be no lon|ger treated with the deference due to
royalty. All ceremony was laid a&s;ide, and he now &s;aw him&s;elf de|prived of
his &s;ervants, and expo&s;ed to the contempt of low-bred in&s;olence. From the
&s;ixth to the twen|tieth of January, the time was employed in making
preparations for this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene of guilt. One hundred and
forty-five per&s;ons were appointed Judges upon this occa&s;ion; and one
Brad&s;haw, a practitioner of the law, was elected as Pre&s;ident of this
dete&s;table &s;ynod.</P>
<P>The King was now conducted from Wind&s;or to St. James's, and was
next day produced before the High Court at We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall to take his
tryal. He &s;till remembered the dignity he owed to him&s;elf before &s;uch an
inferior court; and, taking his place with his hat on, with a &s;tern air,
&s;urveyed his Judges, who were al&s;o covered. When his charge was read,
importing that he had been the cau&s;e of all the blood that was &s;hed &s;ince
the commencement of the rebellion, he could not repre&s;s a &s;mile at once of
contempt and indignation. He then de|manded by what authority he was brought to
&s;uch a tryal? To which Brad&s;haw replied, that he was <PB N="41" REF="44">
tried in the name of the commons of England. The King then objected to the
legality of the tribunal, &s;ince the &s;anction of the Lords and his own were
wanting to complete it; and refu&s;ed to plead to the articles of the
impeachment Being de&s;ired to an|&s;wer &s;everal times; and per&s;i&s;ting in
his refu&s;al, he was remanded to his confinement, and the court adjourned. At
their &s;econd &s;itting the pre&s;ident again &s;ummoned the King to an&s;wer
to his charge; and the King again demurred to the legality of his Judges, and
began to open his objections, when he was interrupted by Brad&s;haw, and &s;ent
back to pri|&s;on, as before. At his third appearance he continued firm to his
purpo&s;e, and refu&s;ed to reply, until he &s;hould be convinced that their
proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom. The
fourth and la&s;t time he appeared before this &s;elf-created court of
ju&s;tice, as he was going thither, he was in&s;ulted by the &s;oldiers, and
the mob, who exclaimed, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ju&s;tice, ju&s;tice, execution,
execution.</HI></Q> He ap|peared before the court with the &s;ame firm
compo|&s;ure as u&s;ual, with his hat on; and while his fen|tence was reading,
in which he was branded with all the odious appellations that malice could
&s;ug|ge&s;t, he di&s;covered no other emotions than tho&s;e of pity. In
walking back from this horrid tribunal, the rabble renewed the cry of 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ju&s;tice, execution;</HI></Q> and among other
in&s;ults one mi&s;creant pre&s;umed to &s;pit in the face of his King. He
patiently wiped his face: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Poor &s;ouls,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>they would
treat their generals in the &s;ame manner for &s;ixpence.</HI></Q> A &s;oldier
more com|pa&s;&s;ionate than the re&s;t could not help imploring a ble&s;&s;ing
upon his royal head; an officer overhearing it &s;truck the pious centinel to
the ground in pre&s;ence of the Monarch, who could not help &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the puni&s;hment exceeded the
offence.</HI></Q> The day of execu|tion was fixed to be the third after his
&s;entence; which when it arrived, he was conducted on foot <PB N="42" REF="45"> through St. James's Park to Whitehall, accompanied by Doctor Juxon,
and guarded by a regiment of foot, under the command of Colonel Tomlin&s;on.
The &s;caffold was covered with black, in the middle of which were &s;een the
block and ax, with two exe|cutioners in ma&s;ques. The &s;oldiers were placed
round it, and an infinite concour&s;e of &s;pectators waited with &s;ilent
horror at a greater di&s;tance. The King &s;urveyed all their &s;olemn
preparations with calm compo&s;ure; he a&s;&s;ured the per&s;ons who &s;tood
with him upon the &s;caffold, that he thought him&s;elf guiltle&s;s of any
crime but that of having given up the Earl of Strafford to the fury of his
enemies; and that he had confidence in the mercy of Heaven. While he thus
avowed his innocence, the Bi&s;hop who attended him warned him that he had but
one &s;tage more to heaven; at which the King cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown, where no di&s;turbance can arrive.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"You are exchanged, replied the Bi&s;hop, from a
temporal to an eternal crown; a good exchange!"</Q> Having now taken off his
cloak, he delivered his George to the Prelate, em|phatically pronouncing the
word, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Remember.</HI></Q> He then laid his head on the
block, and &s;tretched forth his hands as a &s;ignal. One of the men in a
ma&s;que &s;evered his head from his body at a blow; and the other, holding it
up &s;treaming with gore, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>This is the head of a traitor.</HI></Q> Such was
the death of Charles, who lived long enough to &s;ee the laws and
con&s;titution of his country expire before him. He had the misfortune to be
bred up in high notions of the prerogative which he thought his duty to
&s;u&s;tain. He lived at a time when the &s;pirit of the law was in
oppo&s;ition to the genius of the people; and govern|ing by old rules,
in&s;tead of endeavouring to accom|modate him&s;elf to the changes of the
times, he fell in the univer&s;al convul&s;ion. Many Kings before him expired
by trea&s;ons, plots, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; but never <PB N="43" REF="46">
&s;ince the times of Agis the Lacedemonian were any but him &s;acrificed by
their &s;ubjects with all the for|malities of ju&s;tice. Upon the whole, it
mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that, though the nation was branded by fo|reigners
with reproach upon this occa&s;ion, yet the&s;e &s;truggles at length ended in
dome&s;tic happine&s;s and &s;ecurity; the laws became more preci&s;e, and the
&s;ub|ject more ready to obey, as if a previous fermentation in the
con&s;titution was nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;ub&s;equent re|finement.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>CROMWELL, who had &s;ecretly &s;olicited the King's death, now began
to feel wi&s;hes to which he had been hitherto a &s;tranger; he perceived
him&s;elf not far removed from the object of his mo&s;t unbounded ambition. His
views expanded with &s;uc|ce&s;s, and his fir&s;t principles of liberty
&s;hrunk when oppo&s;ed to the unbounded pro&s;pect of power. The parliament,
which was &s;till permitted to enjoy the &s;hadow of authority, voted it high
trea&s;on to ac|knowledge Charles Stewart, &s;on of the murdered King, as
&s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne. They likewi&s;e voted the hou&s;e of Lords
u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous, and pa&s;&s;ed an act for the abolition of all
kingly power. A great &s;eal was made, on one &s;ide of which were engraved the
arms of England and Ireland, with this in&s;cription, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The great &s;eal of England;</HI></Q> on the
rever&s;e was repre&s;ented the hou&s;e of commons &s;itting, with this motto, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The fir&s;t year of freedom, by God's
ble&s;&s;ing, re&s;tored,</HI> 1648.</Q></P>
<P>They next proceeded to try tho&s;e gallant men who&s;e attachment to
their late Sovereign had been mo&s;t remarkable. The Duke of Hamilton and Lord 
<PB N="44" REF="47"> Capel were accu&s;ed, condemned, and beheaded; &s;e|veral
others &s;hared the &s;ame fate. The Earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen were
condemned, but reprieved. The Scotch were not a little di&s;plea&s;ed at the
death of the Duke, who was executed not only contrary to the laws of war, but
the law of nations; they were therefore determined to acknow|ledge the young
Prince for their King. But their love of liberty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;eemed
to combat their re&s;entment; they called him to the throne in|deed, but, at
the &s;ame time, abridged his power with every limitation which they had
formerly at|tempted to impo&s;e on their late Sovereign. The &s;e|cond Charles
had neither the virtue, the con&s;tancy, nor the principles of his father.
Attached to no re|ligion, he agreed to all their propo&s;als, and was
con|tented to accept the formalities without the power of a King. He was
received at Edinburgh with de|mon&s;trations of profound re&s;pect, and entered
the city by that very gate on which the limbs of the brave Montro&s;e, one of
his mo&s;t faithful adherents, were &s;till expo&s;ed; but he &s;oon found that
the life he was likely to lead would be an in&s;upportable bon|dage to one of
his volatile di&s;po&s;ition. He was &s;ur|rounded and ince&s;&s;antly
importuned by the Scotch fanatical clergy, who came to in&s;truct him in
reli|gion, and obliged him to li&s;ten to long &s;ermons, in which they
&s;eldom failed to &s;tigmatize the late King as a tyrant, to accu&s;e his
mother of idolatry, and him&s;elf of an untoward di&s;po&s;ition. Upon
appoint|ed days he was obliged to hear &s;ix &s;ermons without
intermi&s;&s;ion. They in&s;i&s;ted upon his ob&s;erving Sun|day with a
Jewi&s;h &s;trictne&s;s. They even watched his looks; and, if he happened to
&s;mile at any part of their ab&s;urd enthu&s;ia&s;ms, he was reprimanded for
his profanene&s;s. Charles for a while bore this in&s;o|lence with hypocritical
tranquility, and even pre|tended to be highly edified by their in&s;tructions;
but, <PB N="45" REF="48"> notwith&s;tanding this, he only wi&s;hed for an
opportu|nity of e&s;caping from &s;uch a variety of di&s;gu&s;ting
impertinence.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h parliament, alarmed at the King's
re&s;titution in Scotland, &s;ent to recall Cromwell from Ireland, where he had
carried on the war with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. He had reduced Kil|kenny and
many other places, and pro&s;ecuted his conque&s;ts with &s;urpri&s;ing
rapidity. However, he now left the war in that kingdom to be carried on by
Ire|ton, his deputy-lieutenant; and returned to England, in obedience to the
mandate of the parliament. When he took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e, the
&s;peaker thanked him for the &s;ervices he had done the com|monwealth. They
then proceeded to deliberate up|on the war with Scotland. They de&s;ired to
know if Fairfax would conduct the enterprize. Fairfax, a rigid Pre&s;byterian,
who had all along fought from principle, declined oppo&s;ing a nation which he
con|&s;idered as co-operating in the &s;ame good work for which he had fir&s;t
drawn the &s;word; he therefore declined the command, &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ion
to the commons, and retired to &s;pend the remainder of his life in privacy and
peace.</P>
<P>This was an inlet to Cromwell's &s;ub&s;equent power; he was
appointed general of the forces of the com|monwealth, and &s;oon marched into
Scotland at the head of an army of eighteen thou&s;and men, long accu&s;tomed
to conquer. He found general Le&s;ly at the head of an army far more numerous
than his own, but undi&s;ciplined and mutinous. After &s;ome previ|ous
&s;kirmi&s;hing, Cromwell &s;aw him&s;elf in a very di&s;|advantageous po&s;t
near Dunbar, and his antagoni&s;t ready to take advantage of his incommodious
&s;itua|tion. However, perceiving the Scots preparing to give him battle, he
a&s;&s;ured his &s;oldiers that the Lord had delivered the enemy into his
hands, and ordered his army to &s;ing p&s;alms, as already a&s;&s;ured of
victory. <PB N="46" REF="49"> The mini&s;ters of the Scotch army were not
le&s;s &s;an|guine in their a&s;&s;urances of victory than he; they boldly
promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s in the name of the Lord, and excited a &s;pirit of
impatience among the &s;oldi|ers. Victory, as always before, again declared for
Cromwell, who routed the enemy with great &s;laughter, while he did not lo&s;e
on his &s;ide above forty men in all.</P>
<P>Charles, who hated the Scotch army, and only dreaded Cromwell, was
well enough plea&s;ed at this defeat. It &s;erved to introduce him to a greater
&s;hare in the command than he was before permitted to en|joy. He therefore put
him&s;elf at the head of that remnant which &s;urvived the defeat, and
&s;trengthened it by the royali&s;ts, who had been before excluded from his
&s;ervice. And now, in&s;tead of following Cromwell, who led his victorious
troops to Perth, he re&s;olved to &s;eize this opportunity of penetrating into
England, where he expected to be joined by numbers there &s;till attached to
his intere&s;ts. His hopes in this were fru&s;trated; his army, on their march,
was le&s;&s;ened by continual de&s;ertion and di&s;|ea&s;e. Few voluntiers
repaired to the royal &s;tandard; and he at length &s;aw his vigilant enemy
overtaking him at Worce&s;ter. Both armies fought with equal intrepidity, but
Cromwell was again victorious. Ne|ver was &s;o complete a victory obtained by
him be|fore. Two thou&s;and peri&s;hed by the &s;word, and four times that
number, being taken, were &s;old as &s;laves to the American planters. The
conqueror be|came ma&s;ter of all Scotland, and &s;et a price of a thou&s;and
pounds upon the head of the King.</P>

di&s;gui&s;ed as a pea+&s;ant, at wood-cutting. He next made an attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="47" REF="50"> to retire into Wales, under the
conduct of one Pen|drell, a poor but faithful companion in his di&s;tre&s;s.
But in this attempt he was di&s;appointed, every pa&s;s being guarded to
prevent his e&s;cape. Being obliged to return, he met one Colonel Carele&s;s,
who, like him&s;elf, had e&s;caped the carnage at Worce&s;ter; and it was in
his company that he was obliged to climb a &s;preading oak, among the thick
branches of which they pa&s;&s;ed the day together, while the &s;oldiers of the
enemy went underneath in pur&s;uit of him. From thence he pa&s;&s;ed with
imminent danger, feeling all the vici&s;&s;itudes of famine, fatigue, and pain,
to the hou&s;e of one Mr. Lane, a worthy &s;ubject of his, in Stafford&s;hire.
Here he deliberated about the means of e&s;caping to France. They agreed that
he &s;hould ride before this gentleman's daughter, on a vi&s;it to one Mrs.
Horton, who lived in the neigh|bourhood of Bri&s;tol. During this journey he
every day met people who&s;e per&s;ons he knew, and once pa&s;&s;ed through a
whole regiment of the parliament army.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e of Mr. Norton, the fir&s;t per&s;on
they &s;aw was one of his own chap|lains, &s;itting at the door, amu&s;ing
him&s;elf with &s;ee|ing people play at bowls. The King, after having taken
proper care of his hor&s;e in the &s;table, was &s;hewn to an apartment which
Mrs. Lane had pro|vided for him, upon pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition. The
butler, being &s;ent to him with &s;ome refre&s;hment, no &s;ooner beheld his
countenance, which was now very pale with anxiety and fatigue, than he
recollected the vi&s;age of his King and Ma&s;ter, and falling upon his knees,
while the tears &s;treamed down his cheeks, he cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am rejoiced to &s;ee your Maje&s;ty."</Q> The
King enjoined him &s;ecrecy, and the hone&s;t &s;ervant punctually kept his
word. Having &s;taid &s;ome days in this place, he repaired to the hou&s;e of
Colonel Wyndham, where he was cordially receiv|ed, <PB N="48" REF="51"> that
gentleman's family having ever been noted for loyalty. Pur&s;uing his route to
the &s;ea-&s;ide, he once more had a very providential e&s;cape from the little
inn at which he lodged. It happened to be a &s;olemn fa&s;t, and a fanatical
weaver, who had fought in the parliament army, was preaching again&s;t the
King, in a chapel fronting the hou&s;e. Charles was actually one of the
audience, A farrier of the &s;ame principles, who had been examining the
hor&s;es be|longing to the pa&s;&s;engers, came to a&s;&s;ure the preacher,
that he knew by the fa&s;hion of the &s;hoes that one of the &s;tranger's
hor&s;es came from the North. The preacher in&s;tantly affirmed, that this
hor&s;e could be|long to no other than Charles Stewart, and went immediately
with a con&s;table to the hou&s;e; but the King, in the mean time, found means
to e&s;cape. Thus, at length, after inexpre&s;&s;ible hard&s;hips, and having
experienced the fidelity of forty different per|&s;ons of all ranks, who had
power to betray him, he embarked at Brighthelm&s;ted, and landed &s;afely in
Normandy.</P>
<P>Cromwell, in the mean time, returned to London in triumph, where he
was met by the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, accompanied by the mayor and
magi&s;trates in their formalities. His fir&s;t care, upon his return, was to
take the advantage of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, by depre&s;&s;|ing the Scotch. An
act was pa&s;&s;ed for aboli&s;hing royalty in Scotland, and annexing it as a
conquered province to the Engli&s;h commonwealth, impowering it, however, to
&s;end a certain number of repre&s;enta|tives to the Briti&s;h parliament. It
was now &s;een with a&s;toni&s;hment, that a parliament compo&s;ed of ob&s;cure
and weak members could govern at once with unanimity and &s;ucce&s;s. Without
any acknowledged &s;ubordination they levied armies, maintained fleets, and
gave laws to their neighbours. Never was Eng|land more powerful than at this
period. The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactne&s;s. No 
<PB N="49" REF="52"> private per&s;on became rich by public extortions. The
revenues of the crown, the lands of the Bi&s;hops, and a tax of an hundred and
twenty thou&s;and pounds each month, &s;upplied the wants of the government,
and invigorated all their proceedings.</P>
<P>Having reduced the Briti&s;h dominions to perfect obedience, the
parliament next re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e the Dutch, who had given but very
&s;light cau&s;es of complaint. Dori&s;laus, one of the late King's Judges,
being &s;ent thither by the commons as envoy, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the
royal party that had taken refuge there; St. John, appointed Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador. was al&s;o in&s;ulted by the friends of the Prince of Orange.
The&s;e were grounds &s;ufficient to incen&s;e the republic of England to a
war. Its &s;ucce&s;s, how|ever, was doubtful; Blake commanded the Engli&s;h,
and Van Tromp was Admiral of Holland; both equally experienced, courageous, and
active. Seve|ral engagements &s;erved only to &s;hew the excellence of the
Admirals, without determining the balance of naval power. The parliament,
however, was will|ing to continue the war, rightly judging that, when the force
of the nation was exerted by &s;ea, it would dimini&s;h Cromwell the general's
power upon land.</P>
<P>Cromwell was not behind them in penetration; he &s;aw they dreaded
his growing power, and wi&s;hed to dimini&s;h it; all his mea&s;ures were
conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character; and he was now
re&s;olved to make another daring effort. He per&s;uaded his officers to
pre&s;ent a petition for pay|ment of arrears and redre&s;s of grievances, which
he knew would be rejected with di&s;dain. The hou&s;e, upon receiving it,
appointed a committee to prepare an act, that all per&s;ons who pre&s;ented
&s;uch petitions for the future &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea|&s;on.
This was what Cromwell wi&s;hed for. He was &s;itting in council with his
officers, when inform|ed of the &s;ubject on which the hou&s;e was
deliberating. <PB N="50" REF="53"> Turning to major-general Vernon, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I am compelled,</HI> cried he, <HI>to do a thing
that makes the very hair of my head &s;tand on end;</HI></Q> and, &s;tarting up
with marks of violent indignation in his countenance, he ha&s;tened to the
parliament, with a body of three hundred &s;oldiers. Upon entering the hou&s;e,
he took his place, and &s;at &s;ome time to hear the debates; and, when the
&s;peaker was about to put the que&s;tion, he &s;uddenly ro&s;e up, and,
reviling them for their ambition and cruelty, he &s;tamped with his foot, and
in&s;tantly the hou&s;e was filled with armed men. Then addre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to the members, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Get you gone,</HI> &s;aid he; <HI>give place to
hone&s;t men; you are no longer a parliament; I tell you, you are no longer a
parliament; the Lord has done with you.</HI></Q> He then accu&s;ed one as a
drunkard, another as a whorema&s;ter, a third of adultery, and a fourth of
extortion. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>It is you,</HI> added he, <HI>that have forced
me upon this; I have &s;ought the Lord night and day, that he would rather
&s;lay me than put me upon this work.</HI></Q> Then pointing to the mace, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Take away,</HI> cried he, <HI>that
bauble;</HI></Q> and, turning out all the members, he ordered the door to be
locked, and, putting the key in his pocket, retired to Whitehall. Thus by one
daring exploit the new republic was aboli&s;hed, and the whole power, civil and
military, centered in him alone. The pre&s;ent un&s;teady form of the Engli&s;h
government, is the &s;tronge&s;t proof of a late philo|&s;opher's opinion, that
every country is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;et of laws and con&s;titutions
be&s;t adapted to the nature of the inhabitants, the climate, and the &s;oil,
which when once broken through, the government mu&s;t continue weak and
un&s;teady, until the natural con&s;titution is re&s;tored; as in mechanics all
bodies continue to waver till their center of gravity is &s;up|ported.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT parliament, which had long gloried in re&s;i&s;ting violence,
was now di&s;&s;olved by an act of the mo&s;t flagrant oppre&s;&s;ion. The
people, how|ever, expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;like at their di&s;&s;olution.
Crom|well received congratulatory addre&s;&s;es from the fleet, the
corporations, and the army; but he was unwil|ling to put forth all his power at
once; he re&s;olved to amu&s;e them with the form of a commonwealth, and
familiarize them by degrees to arbitrary govern|ment. He decreed, that the
&s;overeign power &s;hould be ve&s;ted in one hundred and forty-four per&s;ons,
un|der the denomination of a parliament; and he un|dertook him&s;elf to make
the choice. The per&s;ons he pitched upon were the lowe&s;t, meane&s;t, and
mo&s;t ignorant among the citizens; he fore&s;aw, that, dur|ing the
admini&s;tration of &s;uch, he alone mu&s;t govern; or that they would &s;oon
throw up the reins of go|vernment, which they were unqualified to guide. To
excel in fanatici&s;m &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary qualifi|cation in this new
parliament. Several, with long names borrowed from &s;cripture, were members;
but a man, who&s;e name was <HI>Prai&s;e God Barebones,</HI> was one of the
mo&s;t remarkable; and by his name the a&s;&s;embly was afterwards called in
ridicule.</P>
<P>To this a&s;&s;embly was committed the care of mak|ing peace with
the Dutch; but, being utterly un&s;kil|led in &s;uch negotiations, the
amba&s;&s;adors of the States were quite at a lo&s;s how to treat with them.
The people exclaimed at &s;o fooli&s;h a legi&s;lature, and they them&s;elves
&s;eemed not in&s;en&s;ible of the contempt and ridicule which they every day
failed not to incur. They had now &s;at five months without doing any thing of
importance; when at length Rou&s;e, their &s;peaker, ro&s;e up, and propo&s;ed
that, as they were unable to bear the burthen that was laid upon them, 
<PB N="52" REF="55"> they &s;hould re&s;ign their authority
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">im from whom they had received it.
Cromwell accepted their re|&s;ignation with plea&s;ure, and &s;ent Colonel
White to clear the hou&s;e of the few fanatics who per&s;i&s;ted in continuing
to &s;it. White, entering with a detach|ment of &s;oldiers, a&s;ked, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>What they did there!</HI></Q> To which replying,
that they were &s;eeking the Lord: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Then you may go el&s;ewhere,</HI> cried he,
<HI>for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here the&s;e many
years.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The officers now, by their own authority, de|clared Cromwell
Protector. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that which is the original of all
command, namely, force; for the &s;trong ever give laws to the feeble. The
mayor and aldermen were &s;ent for; the u&s;urper was in&s;talled at Whitehall,
in the palace of the Eng|li&s;h Kings; he a&s;&s;umed the office of Protector;
was honoured with the epithet of Highne&s;s, and proclaim|ed in London, and
other parts of the kingdom. Thus an ob&s;cure inhabitant of Wales, at length,
ro&s;e to unlimited power, far beyond that of former Kings, by his courage and
his hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>He was about fifty-three years of age when he be|gan to reign, which
he did with equal conduct, mo|deration, and &s;ucce&s;s. He, in the beginning,
cho&s;e among the officers, the former companions of his dangers and victories,
twenty-one coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, to each of whom he a&s;&s;igned a
pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and pounds a year. The troops were always paid a month
in advance; the magazines were well provided; the public trea&s;ure, of which
he had the di&s;po&s;al, was managed with frugality and care. The Dutch were
compelled to &s;ue for peace, and he dic|tated the terms. He in&s;i&s;ted upon
their paying de|ference to the Briti&s;h flag. They were compelled to abandon
the intere&s;t of the King; they engaged to pay eighty-five thou&s;and pounds,
as an indemni|fication for former expences; and to re&s;tore the Engli&s;h
Ea&s;t-India company a part of tho&s;e domi|nions <PB N="53" REF="56"> of which
they had unju&s;tly deprived them in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Every nation with whom the Engli&s;h had any connection, now courted
their Protector's alliance. Among the number France &s;olicited his aid
again&s;t Spain: Cromwell, though capable of conducting the internal parts of
government, had no &s;kill in foreign policy. He lent his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
humble Spain, at a time when the intere&s;ts of Europe required her
ex|altation. Cardinal Mazarine gave him up Dunkirk. His fleet, under the
conduct of the famous Blake, took the i&s;land of Jamaica. The kingdom of
Ire|land was entirely reduced to obedience, and treated by him as a conquered
country; many thou&s;ands of the wretched natives &s;trove to find, in
bani&s;hment, an alleviation of their mi&s;eries; numbers died of fa|mine, and
by the hands of the executioner not a few.</P>
<P>Cromwell, to give the greater appearance of ju&s;tice to his
u&s;urpation, was re&s;olved to govern by parlia|ment, yet by &s;uch a
parliament alone as he could govern. He a&s;&s;embled them, and di&s;&s;olved
them at plea&s;ure; the hou&s;e of Lords was entirely di&s;conti|nued; but he
&s;et up a new chamber of parliament, compo&s;ed of his own creatures, to
oppo&s;e that elected by the voices of the people. Thus, ever active,
vi|gilant, and re&s;olute, he di&s;covered every con&s;piracy again&s;t his
per&s;on, and every in&s;urrection among the people, before they took effect.
He had the addre&s;s to prevail upon his parliament to make him an offer of the
crown, merely to have the &s;eeming magnani|mity of refu&s;ing it, and thus to
confirm his real power.</P>
<P>His private life was no le&s;s worthy our ob&s;erva|tion; he led an
ob&s;cure life in the palace a&s;&s;igned for his habitation, without pomp,
without luxury. When he &s;ent his &s;on Henry into Ireland, he al|lowed him
but one &s;ervant in his retinue. His man|ners <PB N="54" REF="57"> were
naturally au&s;tere, and he pre&s;erved the dignity and di&s;tance of his
character in the mid&s;t of the coar&s;e&s;t familiarity. He was cruel from
policy; ju&s;t and temperate from inclination; laborious and exact in all his
de&s;igns; without eloquence he had the talent of per&s;uading; and without
&s;incerity the art of making &s;incere adherents: his dexterity equal|ly
&s;atisfied every &s;ect; with Pre&s;byterians, a Pre&s;by|rian; with Dei&s;ts
a Dei&s;t; only an Independant in principle. It was by the&s;e arts he
continued his authority, fir&s;t cemented by blood, and maintained by
hypocri&s;y and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding this conduct, which contri|buted to render
him truly formidable at home, he was, after a few years reign, become truly
mi&s;erable to him&s;elf. He knew that he was dete&s;ted by every party in the
kingdom; he knew the fierce &s;pirit of the people whom he had made &s;laves;
and he was ince&s;&s;antly haunted by the terrors of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.
To increa&s;e his calamity, a book was publi&s;hed, in|titled, <HI>Killing no
murder;</HI> in which it was proved to be ju&s;t to de&s;troy him at any rate. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Shall we,</HI> &s;aid this popular declaimer,
<HI>who would not &s;uffer the lion to invade us, tamely &s;tand to be devoured
by the wolf?</HI></Q> Crom|well read this &s;pirited treati&s;e, and it is
&s;aid was ne|ver &s;een to &s;mile afterwards. He wore armour un|der his
cloaths, and always kept a loaded pi&s;tol in his pocket; his a&s;pect became
cloudy, and he re|garded every &s;tranger with a glance of timid
&s;u&s;pi|cion. He always travelled with hurry and precipi|tation, and never
&s;lept two nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the &s;ame apartment. A tertian ague
came at la&s;t to deliver him from a life of horror and mi&s;ery. He died at
Whitehall, after having nominated his &s;on Richard Cromwell as his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. Notwith&s;tand|ing the evident approaches of death, his
fanatical chaplains affirmed that he would recover, and thanked God for the
undoubted a&s;&s;urances they had <PB N="55" REF="58"> received of his
&s;afety. He was even of the &s;ame opinion him&s;elf. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I tell you,</HI> cried he to the phy&s;icians
that attended him, <HI>I &s;hall not die of this di&s;temper; fa|vourable
an&s;wers have been returned from Heaven, not only to my own &s;upplications,
but likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of the godly, who carry on a more intimate
corre&s;pondence with the Lord.</HI></Q> This behaviour, at his death, is an
undeniable proof that he was in reality more the enthu&s;ia&s;t than an
hy|pocrite; and, in fact, we are more frequently de|ceived our&s;elves, than we
attempt to deceive others.</P>
<P>Whatever were the differences of intere&s;t after the death of the
U&s;urper, the influence of his name was &s;till &s;ufficient to get Richard
his &s;on proclaimed Pro|tector. The parties, however, were now grown too
head&s;trong to be controlled by greater abilities; what then could Richard do
who had nothing active in his di&s;po&s;ition, no talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, no
know|ledge of government, no ambition, no importance? Oliver, by means of the
army, had long governed the kingdom; they were now left to govern alone. They
fir&s;t therefore pre&s;ented a petition to the new Protector, demanding that
no member of the army &s;hould be &s;ubject to the civil power, and that the
officers &s;hould enjoy the privilege of chu&s;ing their own general. Richard,
&s;hocked at their pre&s;ump|tion, rejected their reque&s;ts, and even
threatened to di&s;mi&s;s them the &s;ervice. The parliament attempted to
&s;upport the&s;e mea&s;ures of Richard, but the army prevailed; the parliament
was di&s;&s;olved by their me|naces, and the Protector again reduced to a
private &s;tation. The officers, once more being thus left to them&s;elves,
determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the
King, and which the late Protector had &s;o di&s;gracefully di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed.
This was called <HI>The good old cau&s;e;</HI> and &s;uch of the higher
officers as &s;eemed unwilling to give up their authority to this parliament,
were intimidated by their &s;ubalterns into a compliance.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59"> The Rump parliament, as it was called, being
thus once again e&s;tabli&s;hed, began by vigorou&s;ly at|tempting to
le&s;&s;en the power of that very army which had ju&s;t now given them all
their authority. They new-modelled a part of the forces, ca&s;hiered &s;uch
of|ficers as they feared, and placed others in their room. The&s;e attempts,
however, did not pa&s;s without vigo|rous efforts in the principal officers who
were at London to oppo&s;e them. They held &s;everal conferences together to
&s;trengthen their power, and le&s;&s;en that of their oppo&s;ers. They at
length came to the u&s;ual re&s;ource of the&s;e turbulent times; they fir&s;t
pre&s;ented a &s;e|ditious petition; and, upon finding it rejected, con|ducted
by general Lambert, they entered the hou&s;e, excluded the members,
di&s;&s;olved the parliament by their own authority, and formed a council of
ten to provide for the &s;afety of the commonwealth. Dur|ing the&s;e
tran&s;actions, general Monck was at the head of twelve thou&s;and veterans in
Scotland. Monck had begun his fortunes under the command of the late King, and
was taken pri&s;oner in his &s;ervice. Upon the death of his Ma&s;ter he was
relea&s;ed from his long confinement to command under Cromwell, for whom he
always fought with conduct and &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>In this anarchy and confu&s;ion he &s;eemed agitated by different
de&s;igns, between loyalty to his lawful King, ambition to advance him&s;elf,
and the appre|hen&s;ions he was under from the governing part of the nation;
his loyalty at length prevailed; he re|&s;olved to re&s;tore the royal family,
but to u&s;e all the precautions that were requi&s;ite for their &s;afety and
his own. He &s;oon had an opportunity of embarra&s;|&s;ing the affairs of the
nation &s;till more, to prepare the way for her meditated revolution. The
officers, now formed into a council of ten, had &s;ent to treat with him; he
con&s;ented to a negotiation only in or|der to gain time; and after a treaty
had been actu|ally <PB N="57" REF="60"> &s;igned by tho&s;e he employed in this
bu&s;ine&s;s, he refu&s;ed to ratify it upon frivolous pretences. The depo&s;ed
parliament, finding that Monck had di&s;ap|proved of the proceedings of the
officers at London, were re&s;olved to avail them&s;elves of his friend&s;hip,
in order to be rein&s;tated in their former authority; and &s;ent him a private
commi&s;&s;ion, appointing him com|mander in chief of all the forces in
England, Scot|land, and Ireland. He now therefore re&s;olved to march towar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s London, and upon his approach the
officers wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had depo&s;ed the
parliament found them|&s;elves almo&s;t de&s;erted, and at length compelled to
re|&s;ign the authority they had u&s;urped. When he reached St. Alban's, he
&s;ent a letter to the hou&s;e, de&s;iring that London &s;hould be cleared of
all other troops to make way for his approach. This demand awakened the
&s;u&s;picion of the parliament, but they were reluctantly obliged to comply.
He entered London in triumph at the head of his army, and re|paired to the
council of &s;tate, but refu&s;ed taking the oath of abjuration, &s;hrewdly
ob&s;erving that the fewer oaths were taken, the cleaner would the
con&s;ciences be. He next examined his officers, and, having &s;e|cured their
concurrence, he re&s;tored tho&s;e members to the parliament which long &s;ince
had been &s;ecluded before the trial of the King.</P>
<P>The Independants, who had voted for the trial of Charles, were now
greatly out-numbered; and it was &s;oon &s;een that the royal party was likely
to pre|vail. The republicans, who, though they hated a Pro|tector, &s;till more
feared the royal re&s;entment, endea|voured to per&s;uade Monck to a&s;&s;ume
the &s;overeign power, in imitation of Cromwell. He rejected their advice, and
in the mean time gave the King private intimations of his de&s;igns,
new-modelled the army, quelled an incipient in&s;urrection, and prepared all
things for his re&s;toration.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61"> Nothing now was wanting, but the authority and
con&s;ent of a free parliament, to &s;ettle the fluctuating con&s;titution. On
the twenty-fifth of April 1660, the new parliament met in both hou&s;es, after
the manner of their ance&s;tors. They immediately voted that the government
ought to be ve&s;ted in a King, Lords, and Commons. On the eighth of May
Charles II. was proclaimed in London; on the twenty-&s;ixth he arrived at
Dover; on the twenty-ninth he reached Whitehall through an innumerable
multitude of people, who rent the air with their ac|clamations. The wretched
kingdom, long torn with faction, and oppre&s;&s;ed by its own &s;truggles for
free|dom, once more began to re&s;pire; fanatici&s;m, with all its train of
melancholy terrors and cruelties, was now di&s;pelled; the arts of peace began

before &s;o vehe|mently oppo&s;ed the late Monarch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every
virtue, were now profu&s;e in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
who&s;e character &s;tood in no manner of competition with that of his
father.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t ordained to have the bodies of Crom|well, Ireton, and
Brad&s;haw, dug from their graves, <PB N="59" REF="62"> and dragged to the
place of execution; here they continued hanging the whole day, and then were
interred under the gallows. Of tho&s;e who &s;at in judgment on the late
Monarch's trial, &s;ome were dead, and &s;ome were thought worthy to find
par|don; ten only out of four&s;core were devoted to im|mediate de&s;truction.
The&s;e were enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who had all along acted from principle, and bore
their fate with all the confidence of martyrs. They had been formerly cruel
them&s;elves, and they were now in turn treated with &s;hocking inhumanity; the
exe|cutioners, not content with performing the office of death, added in&s;ult
to their tortures; the &s;uffer|ers, to a man, thanked God for being permitted
to die for his cau&s;e, and braved the fury of their oppre&s;|&s;ors with manly
contempt.</P>
<P>Their deaths &s;eemed to in&s;pire a few de&s;perate
en|thu&s;ia&s;ts with the mo&s;t &s;trange confidence that ever deluded a poor
ignorant party. One Venner, who expected the immediate coming of Chri&s;t upon
earth, appeared in the &s;treets of London in arms, at the head of three&s;core
enthu&s;ia&s;ts like him&s;elf, and de|clared again&s;t any other Monarch but
King Je&s;us. They had been wrought into &s;uch a pitch of phrenzy as to
believe them&s;elves invulnerable, and fought as men confident of victory. The
few &s;urvivors of their defeat were taken, tried, condemned, and executed:
they affirmed to the la&s;t, that, if they had been de|ceived, the Lord
him&s;elf concurred in the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>It was now feared that the tide of loyalty would bear down all the
&s;ormer mounds of freedom; the par|liament &s;eemed to concur in all the
de&s;igns of the court, and even to anticipate its wi&s;hes; but, though the
King was e&s;tabli&s;hed, his old faithful friends, and the followers of his
family, were left unrewarded. There were numbers who had fought for his father,
and for him, and had lo&s;t their all in his &s;ervice, &s;till pining in want
and mi&s;ery; while their per&s;ecutors, <PB N="60" REF="63"> who, prefiting by
the troubles of their country, had acquired fortunes during the civil war, were
&s;till per|mitted to enjoy them without mole&s;tation. The &s;uf|ferers
petitioned in vain; Charles was no way re|markable for gratitude; his
plea&s;ures, his flatterers, and concubines engro&s;&s;ed all his attention,
and ex|hau&s;ted his finances; the unhappy Cavaliers murmur|ed without
redre&s;s; he fled from their gloomy expo|&s;tulations to &s;cenes of mirth,
riot, and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>The kingdom now &s;eemed to be converted into a theatre of
debauchery, which had before been a &s;cene of blood. The Independants were no
longer to be &s;een; the Puritans were re&s;trained; the hor|rors of the late
war were the &s;ubject of ridicule; the formality and the ignorance of
&s;ectaries were di&s;|played upon the &s;tage, and even laughed at in the
pulpit. The King had no religion; and, though he permitted the per&s;ecution of
&s;ectaries, it was merely from political motives. The late mi&s;eries of the
na|tion were not &s;ufficient to deter a few de&s;perate fana|ties from
attempting to excite them afre&s;h; they laid a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing
&s;everal towns in the North, and rai&s;ing a general in&s;urrection; the
mini|&s;try di&s;covered the plot, before it was ripe for execu|tion; thirty of
the con&s;pirators were taken and exe|cuted; and this plot was a pretext for
continuing the parliament then &s;itting, and repealing the act for triennial
parliaments, as being dangerous in times of commotion.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h parliament &s;eemed willing to make the King
reparation for their former di&s;obedience, and the Scotch were &s;till more
&s;anguine in the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their attachment. Had Charles been an
active Monarch, he might have now become an ab|&s;olute one. They confirmed the
doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience by a &s;olemn act; they a&s;&s;igned him a
re|venue of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, exclu&s;ive of the expence
nece&s;&s;ary for &s;itting and &s;upplying <PB N="61" REF="64"> the fleet.
None of his predece&s;&s;ors were ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a large
revenue; neverthele&s;s, his prodigality rendered him indigent, and, in&s;tead
of de&s;iring an a&s;|cendancy over his parliament, he was content to be an
humble and continual dependant on their bounty.</P>
<P>His prodigality, his libertini&s;m, and the familiarity with which
he permitted him&s;elf to be treated by his &s;ubjects, &s;oon began to alter
their &s;entiments from a veneration for royalty to a contempt of his per&s;on
and admini&s;tration. He declared war again&s;t Hol|land, merely to have an
opportunity of &s;pending up|on his plea&s;ures. a part of tho&s;e &s;ums
granted him by parliament for the &s;upport of a fleet and army. This war was
carried on with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s; but the alarm which the nation received
from Ruyter the Dutch Admiral's attempting to &s;ail up the river Thames,
&s;till more di&s;gu&s;ted them again&s;t their go|vernor. Immediate dangers,
though &s;mall, influ|ence the mind with greater force than di&s;tant, though
terrible calamities. They now called to mind the admini&s;tration of Cromwell,
when the people en|joyed &s;ecurity at home, and were re&s;pected abroad; they
recollected that vigorous U&s;urper's labours for the good of the nation, and
compared them with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent effeminate and un&s;ucce&s;sful
reign.</P>
<P>Natural and accidental calamities &s;eemed to unite them&s;elves to
tho&s;e brought on by bad management. A plague ravaged the city, which &s;wept
away more than one hundred thou&s;and of its inhabitants; and &s;oon after the
city was almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed by a conflagration, which raged for
three days without intermi&s;&s;ion. The &s;pirit of the people &s;oon
&s;urmount|ed the&s;e calamities; London &s;oon ro&s;e more beauti|ful from its
a&s;hes; the &s;treets were built anew more &s;pacious and convenient than
before; and their di|&s;tre&s;s &s;oon became their advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="65"> But neither war, nor accident, nor the murmurs
of the people could abate the pa&s;&s;ion for gallantry, plea&s;ure, and
expence, that reigned through the court through the King's example. He had
imbibed all that &s;pirit of levity, during his re&s;idence in France, for
which that kingdom is remarkable. Though he had been married &s;oon after his
re&s;toration to the Infanta of Portugal, he kept &s;everal mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
by whom he had natural i&s;&s;ue. Among this number were mada|moi&s;elle
Quero&uuml;aille, a French woman, whom he created Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth;
Mrs. Palmer, whom he made a Counte&s;s; and Nel Gwyn and Mrs. Davis,
actre&s;&s;es taken from the theatre.</P>
<P>But, though the court was thus lo&s;t to decency, the pa&s;&s;ion
for uniformity in religion in the nation &s;eemed to revive. The parliament was
equally &s;et again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians and the Papi&s;ts; an act was made
called the <HI>Te&s;t act,</HI> importing that every per&s;on in office and
employment &s;hould take the oaths of al|iegiance and &s;upremacy, receive the
&s;acrament in &s;ome pari&s;h church before competent witne&s;&s;es, and
&s;ub&s;cribe a declaration, renouncing the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.
This was levelled again&s;t the Duke of York, the King's brother, who had
pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, and whom the parliament &s;e|cretly aimed
at excluding from the throne. The fears and di&s;contents of the nation were
vented with|out re&s;traint; the apprehen&s;ions of a Popi&s;h
&s;ucce&s;|&s;or, an abandoned court, a parliament that had con|tinued, without
a new election, for &s;eventeen years; an alliance cemented with France, the
&s;ecret enemy of England and the Prote&s;tant religion; and an
un|&s;ucce&s;sful and expen&s;ive war with Holland, their na|tural allies; all
gave cau&s;e to kindle a &s;pirit of indig|nation among the people. The court
tried every method, but in vain, to &s;atisfy the&s;e murmurs, or ap|pea&s;e
them. Even the coffee-hou&s;es were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed where &s;uch topics were
generally debated.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66"> This univer&s;al ferment, as may ea&s;ily be
imagin|ed, broke out into an alarm. When the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h is once
excited, they either find objects of re&s;entment, or they make them. A rumour
of a Popi&s;h con&s;piracy was fir&s;t propagated, and one Titus Oates &s;oon
appeared to give it confirmation. Titus Oates had been from his youth an
indigent and infa|mous adventurer. He was abandoned, illiterate, and
&s;hamele&s;s. He had been once indicted for perjury, afterwards chaplain of a
man of war, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for unnatural practices. He then profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf a Roman Catholic, went to the Je&s;uits College at St. Omer, but was
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, after &s;ome re&s;idence there, with infamy. He then returned
to London, filled with projects of revenge; and the animo&s;ities of this
unhappy nation &s;oon appeared a proper place of nou|ri&s;hment to give this
viper's virulence effect. He depo&s;ed upon oath, that the Je&s;uits, &s;everal
of whom he named, and who were &s;oon after taken up, had tried the King under
the name of the <HI>Black Ba&s;tard,</HI> condemned him as an heretic, and
re&s;olved to de|prive him of life: that &s;everal attempts had been made
without &s;ucce&s;s, and that not only the King's brother, but even the Queen
were privy to the de|&s;ign. The hou&s;e of commons immediately took fire at
this pretended con&s;piracy; they petitioned for re|moving the Queen, rewarded
Oates with a pen&s;ion of twelve hundred pounds, and immediately ordered the
con&s;pirators to be tried in the courts of ju&s;tice. Se|veral Je&s;uits were
tried; their very profe&s;&s;ion was at that time &s;ufficient to de&s;troy
them; before a partial Judge and an exa&s;perated Jury, no mercy could be
expected, and &s;everal, though apparently innocent, were executed as traytors
upon this mi&s;creant's in|formation. Coleman, the Duke of York's &s;ecretary,
Ireland, Pickering, Grove, Fenwick, and White-bread were among the fir&s;t that
fell; they died de|claring <PB N="64" REF="67"> their innocence to the la&s;t
moment of their lives.</P>
<P>While the Prote&s;tants were labouring to humble both the Puritans
and the Papi&s;ts, tho&s;e two parties were at the &s;ame time mutually
employed in ruining each other. Plot was &s;et again&s;t plot; that con|trived
by Oates was called the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> that &s;et to oppo&s;e it was
called by the name of the <HI>Meal|tub Plot,</HI> as the &s;cheme of the
con&s;piracy was found hidden in a meal-tub. This was a de&s;ign again&s;t
Oates, for his perjuries had drawn upon him the furious re&s;entment of the
Catholic party; they were determined to take away his life by the &s;ame
fal&s;e evidence by which he had taken the lives of &s;o many others.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e plots tending to di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom,
it is &s;aid the Earl of Shafte&s;bury was at the bottom; he had been a member
of the Long Parliament in the civil wars, and had gained great influence among
the Pre&s;byterians; he had in&s;inu|ated him&s;elf into the confidence of
Cromwell, and afterwards employed his credit in forwarding the re|&s;toration.
He had been made one of the privy|council in the pre&s;ent reign, but was
ejected thence for the duplicity of his conduct. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
uncommon abilities, joined with turbulence, di&s;|&s;imulation, and unbounded
ambition. It was thought that this nobleman, in revenge for his di&s;grace at
court, headed the demagogue faction, and alarmed the King with uncea&s;ing
dangers.</P>
<P>He artfully increa&s;ed the people's apprehen&s;ions of a Popi&s;h
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, and, by his intere&s;t, brought a bill into the hou&s;e of
commons for the exclu&s;ion of James Duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In
the national animo&s;ity rai&s;ed again&s;t Papi&s;ts it was no dif|ficult
matter to have it pa&s;&s;ed through the hou&s;e of commons; but, being
pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of peers, it was thrown out by a great majori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68"> The commons were greatly incen&s;ed at this
re|pul&s;e, but particularly their anger fell upon the Earl of Halifax, who
exerted him&s;elf in the oppo&s;ition. Halifax di&s;regarded their anger,
&s;ecure in con&s;cious innocence. But their rage fell with more weight upon
Lord Stafford, who had long been a pri&s;oner in the Tower, upon the
depo&s;ition of Oates. Not|with&s;tanding his age, his weak intellects, and the
ju&s;tne&s;s of his defence, he was arraigned, condemn|ed, and executed for a
plot which had its only foun|dation in perjury and &s;ubornation. All things
threat|ened a renewal of the former troubles from which the kingdom had been
but lately &s;et free. The commons pre&s;ented petition after petition to the
King, de&s;iring the puni&s;hment of Papi&s;ts, and the abridgment of the royal
prerogative. They &s;eemed willing to intimidate the King, or to inflame the
nation. At length Charles &s;hewed a degree of for|titude that &s;urprized even
his friends; he rejected their petitions with contempt, and di&s;&s;olved the
par|liament that had abu&s;ed their power.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the nation at that time, with regard to religion, was
thus: The principal men at court, if they profe&s;&s;ed any, were of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed church; &s;o were all the men of great property, as well as the
dregs of the people; but that body of men who voted at elections, placed
between a &s;tate of opulence and penury, were in general Pre&s;byterians. They
were therefore willing to return repre&s;entatives only of that
per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Charles, however, was re&s;olved to try one parlia|ment more, and
appointed them to meet him at Ox|ford, the city of London having long been
di&s;plea&s;ing, by rea&s;on of their republican principles. The new
parliament, however, &s;eemed &s;till more turbulent than the former; the
members came armed, and attended by their friends and adherents, as if they
expected to fight, and not deliberate. The repre&s;entatives of 
<PB N="66" REF="69"> London were in particular attended by a numerous body of
hor&s;emen, wearing cockades, in&s;cribed, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>No Popery, no Slavery.</HI></Q> To declaim
again&s;t Popery was the voice of faction in the la&s;t reign, and &s;uch it
was in the pre&s;ent. The &s;ame &s;pirit that had animated the former
parliament, &s;eemed redoubled in this. They in&s;i&s;ted on the bill for
excluding the Duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; they per&s;i&s;ted in
declaring that all Papi&s;ts &s;hould be bani&s;hed, and their children
educated in the Prote&s;tant religion; that the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive
obedience was injurious to the rights of &s;ociety. In a word, the leaders of
the oppo&s;ition were re&s;olved to be di&s;plea&s;ed with every mea&s;ure the
King could propo&s;e, and prepared to recall the for|mer ari&s;tocracy into the
kingdom. Charles, &s;eeing that nothing could be expected from coun&s;els
manag|ed by party, and not deliberation, once more di&s;&s;olv|ed this
parliament, with a &s;tedfa&s;t re&s;olution of never calling another.</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke they had never expected, and which the times
alone could ju&s;tify. From the mo|ment the royal and parliamentary commotions
were ended, Charles &s;eemed to rule with de&s;potic power, and was re&s;olved
to leave to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the faults and the misfortunes of his
admini&s;tration. His tem|per, which had been always ea&s;y and merciful,
be|came arbitrary, and even cruel; he entertained &s;pies and informers round
the throne, and impri&s;oned all &s;uch as he thought mo&s;t daring in their
de&s;igns. He re&s;olved to humble the Pre&s;byterians; all &s;uch were
dive&s;ted of their employments, and their places filled with &s;uch as
approved the doctrine of non-re|&s;i&s;tance. The clergy te&s;tified their zeal
to the court by their writings and &s;ermons; the partizans of the King were
mo&s;t numerous; but tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite faction were more
enterpri&s;ing; the mutual animo|fity of each was inflamed into rage and
rancour, and the King openly declared him&s;elf at the head of a 
<PB N="67" REF="70"> faction. The city of London particularly fell under his
re&s;entment; he deprived them of their charter, and only re&s;tored it when he
had &s;ubjected the elec|tion of their magi&s;trates to his immediate
authority.</P>
<P>Such an arbitrary admini&s;tration could not fail of exciting new
in&s;urrections; &s;everal noblemen, among whom were the Duke of Monmouth, the
King's na|tural &s;on, the Lord Shafte&s;bury, Ru&s;&s;el, Grey, and others,
entered into a combination to de&s;troy the King, which was called after the
<HI>Rye-hou&s;e plot.</HI> The con&s;pirators met at the hou&s;e of one
Shepherd, a wine-merchant, where they propo&s;ed a ri&s;ing in London,
Bri&s;tol, Devon&s;hire, and Che&s;hire. They agreed upon a declaration for
ju&s;tifying their de&s;ign, but the &s;cheme was at fir&s;t delayed from the
difficulty of the preparations previous to taking the field, and &s;oon after
di&s;covered by one Keiling, who expected to earn a pardon for him&s;elf by
impeaching his a&s;&s;o|ciates. As the plot began to open, new informers came
in; Monmouth ab&s;conded, Grey e&s;caped the me&s;&s;enger who had been &s;ent
to arre&s;t him, Ru&s;&s;el was committed to the Tower, and Shafte&s;bury, who
fore&s;aw the danger, had taken refuge in Holland. Lord E&s;&s;ex, Sidney, the
great philo&s;opher and law|giver, and Hampden, grand&s;on of the famous man of
that name, were informed again&s;t, and committed to confinement.</P>
<P>The principal informer upon this occa&s;ion was Lord Howard, a man
every way debauched, and who was willing to accept infamy for &s;afety: by his
evidence Ru&s;&s;el and Sidney were condemned, and died with that intrepidity
which was worthy a bet|ter cau&s;e. While the&s;e men were thus executed,
Monmouth was in the mean time &s;oliciting his par|don; and he who was mo&s;t
culpable, as his crime was mo&s;t unnatural, ea&s;ily obtained it.</P>
<P>The &s;everities exerci&s;ed in the latter part of this reign
aro&s;e merely from the influence of the Duke <PB N="68" REF="71"> of York, who
was as much inclined to cruelty by nature, as his brother Charles was prone to
forgive|ne&s;s. His authority was become terrible even to the mini&s;try; by
his advice the King &s;eized upon all the charters of the corporations, in
order to extort mo|ney for having them renewed. Partiality and op|pre&s;&s;ion
were the in&s;truments of his power, and bi|gotry and innovation the objects of
his aim. At this period the reign of Charles was as ab&s;olute as that of any
Monarch in Chri&s;tendom, and new di&s;|contents and trea&s;ons were &s;ecretly
diffu&s;ing their poi&s;on, the &s;pirit of liberty &s;till &s;truggling hard
again&s;t the &s;pirit of obedience, which the clergy at|tempted to inculcate.
Another civil war threatened the nation, &s;till more dreadful than the former,
as the forces were more equally divided. But Charles happily died before
tho&s;e calamities could return; he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with an apoplectic
fit, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign.
The people, though they de&s;pi&s;ed his ad|mini&s;tration, loved his per&s;on;
they were willing to bear with the faults of one who&s;e whole behaviour was a
continued in&s;tance of good-nature and affabi|lity; but they were by no means
willing to grant the &s;ame indulgence to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whom they hated
for his pride, his religion, his cruelty, and connections. He was unfit to walk
in the irregular &s;teps of his predece&s;&s;or; and, when he pur&s;ued the
&s;ame route, fatal experience &s;oon convinced him that he had at once
mi&s;taken him&s;elf and the people he attempted to command.</P>
<P>But, though England, during the reign of Charles, &s;eemed &s;till,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, agitated like the ocean after a &s;torm, yet commerce
continued to increa&s;e with its u&s;ual celerity and &s;ucce&s;s. The
manufac|ture of certain &s;tuffs, gla&s;s, copper, &s;teel, paper, hats, and
&s;tockings, were now brought to perfec|tion. Upon the bani&s;hing the
Prote&s;tants from <PB N="69" REF="72"> France, numbers came and &s;ettled
here, and brought their arts with them. This application to arts and commerce
gave England great weight in the balance of Europe; Britain became the center
of politics and arms. Though literature was but little encouraged by the
Sovereign, yet the learned made great profi|ciency in every department of
&s;cience; and the philo&s;ophers of England began to take the lead. Newton,
Tillot&s;on, Burnet, Hobbes, and Shafte&s;|bury enlarged the land-marks of
human knowledge; Butler, Dryden, Otway, gave &s;trength and proprie|ty to the
language. In a word, the character of the nation now began to alter; the
natural rudene&s;s of the inhabitants began to take a poli&s;h from good
breeding, and Briti&s;h ferocity to meliorate into cha|rity and humanity.</P>

<P>AS we de&s;cend, we find the materials for Engli&s;h hi&s;tory
increa&s;e; the minute&s;t tran&s;actions are recorded with prolixity; and
the&s;e, however dry and unimproving to &s;ome, are yet both intere&s;ting and
&s;atisfactory to others. In &s;uch a profu&s;ion of mate|rials I mu&s;t be
content rather to give the &s;pirit of the following reigns, than pretend to
exhibit an hi|&s;torical detail of particular intere&s;ts and intrigues. It
will be enough to mark tho&s;e &s;trong out-lines that may probably e&s;cape
the wreck of time, when the internal colouring &s;hall fade. As hi&s;tory
increa&s;es in time by the addition of new events, an epitome becomes more
nece&s;&s;ary to abridge its excre&s;cences.</P>
<P>The Duke of York, who &s;ucceeded his brother, with the title of
King James the Second, had been bred a Papi&s;t, and was &s;trongly bigotted to
his prin|ciples. <PB N="70" REF="73"> It is the property of that religion,
almo&s;t ever, to contract the &s;phere of the under&s;tanding; and, until
people are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;engaged from its prejudices, it is
impo&s;&s;ible to lay a ju&s;t claim to exten&s;ive views, or con&s;i&s;tency
of de&s;ign. The intellects of this Prince were naturally weak, and his
bigotted principles &s;till rendered them more fee|ble; he conceived the
ridiculous project of reigning in the &s;ame arbitrary manner of his
predece&s;&s;or, and changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of his country, at a
time when his per&s;on was hated, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed religion was
univer&s;ally approved.</P>
<P>The people of England were now entirely changed from what they had
been in the times of Henry, Mary, and Elizabeth, who had altered religion at
will. Learning was now as much cultivated by the laity as by the prie&s;thood;
every man now pretended to think for him&s;elf, and had rational grounds for
his opinion. In the beginning of the reformation the Monarchs had only to bring
over the clergy, in order totally to change the modes of belief, for the people
were entirely guided by their pa&s;tors. To influence the prie&s;thood was an
ea&s;y ta&s;k. The hopes of preferment, or the fears of degradation, entirely
&s;ubjected the con&s;ciences of the clergy to the royal will. Such it was
then; but the circum|&s;tances of the nation were, at pre&s;ent, entirely
al|tered; and, to make a change in religion, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary
to tamper with every individual in the &s;tate. But James had no idea of the
alter|ation of circum&s;tances; his &s;ituation, he thought, &s;upplied him
with authority, and his zeal furni&s;hed him with hope of accompli&s;hing this
chimerical de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s he met with in cru&s;hing a rebellion, in the
opening of his reign, &s;eemed to promi&s;e a favourable omen towards the
completion of his wi&s;hes. The Duke of Monmouth, who had long 
<PB N="71" REF="74"> been at the head of faction, and inflamed all the
di&s;content that mole&s;ted the late King's reign, was now re&s;olved to aim
at the crown. He was the darl|ing of the people; and &s;ome averred that the
King had married his mother, and owned his legitimacy at his death. The Earl of
Argyle &s;econded his views, and they formed a &s;cheme of a double
in&s;ur|rection. Argyle fir&s;t landed in Scotland, publi&s;hed his
manife&s;toes, put him&s;elf at the head of two thou|&s;and five hundred men,
and attempted to influence the nation; but, a formidable body of the King's
forces coming again&s;t him, his army fell away, and he him&s;elf, after being
wounded in attempting to e&s;cape, was taken by a pea&s;ant, &s;tanding up to
his neck in water. Being brought to Edinburgh, he prepared for death, well
knowing that it was not in the King's nature to forgive an enemy.</P>
<P>The Duke of Monmouth was not more fortunate; he &s;ailed from the
Texel with three ve&s;&s;els, and ar|rived on the coa&s;ts of Dor&s;et&s;hire
with about four|&s;core followers. The country &s;oon flocked in to his
&s;tandard, and in two days his army was increa&s;ed to two thou&s;and men. The
Earl of Fever&s;ham was &s;ent to oppo&s;e him, and took po&s;t at Sedgemore, a
village in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Monmouth re&s;olved to fight him, and began his
march about eleven in the night, with profound &s;ilence; but the Royali&s;ts
were prepared for his reception. The action began at day-break; Lord Grey, who
commanded the Duke of Monmouth's hor&s;e, was routed at the fir&s;t on&s;et.
The Duke, at the head of his infantry, bravely maintained his ground until he
was charged in flank by the enemy's hor&s;e, who had been ju&s;t now
victo|rious. A total rout en&s;ued; three hundred were killed in the
engagement, and a thou&s;and in the pur&s;uit. The Duke e&s;caped the carnage,
and, in a &s;hepherd's di&s;gui&s;e, fled on foot, attended by a faith|ful
companion, who had followed his fortunes into <PB N="72" REF="75"> England.
Thus they travelled onward towards Dor|&s;et&s;hire, till, quite exhau&s;ted
with hunger and fa|tigue, they lay down in a field, and covered them|&s;elves
with &s;tubble. In this forlorn &s;ituation he was found, with &s;ome pea&s;e
in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to &s;u&s;tain life. His
&s;pirit &s;unk with his misfortunes; he wrote to the King; im|plored his
mercy; the King gave him an audience, as if willing to &s;atisfy his vengeance
with the &s;ight of a rival's mi&s;ery. But his death was determined, and no
intreaties could extort royal clemency. On the &s;eaffold he re&s;umed his
former courage, handled the ax, declared that he meant well to the nation, and
his head was cut off, but not till after the third blow.</P>
<P>But it were happy for the nation, and fortunate for the King, if the
blood that was already &s;hed had been thought a &s;ufficient explation for the
late offence. The victorious army behaved with the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty to
the pri&s;oners taken after the battle. Their inhumanity was properly
&s;econded by Jefferies, who was &s;ent on the we&s;tern circuit to try the
in&s;urgents. His furious thir&s;t of blood being inflamed by continual
intoxication, he threatened, calumniated, and threw a&s;ide even the appearance
of clemency. Men and women indi&s;crimately felt the effects of his &s;avage
zeal; and not le&s;s than two hundred and fifty per&s;ons expired under
circum|&s;tances of wanton cruelty. Cruel Kings ever find cruel
mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected, that the&s;e butcheries could acquire the
King the love or the confidence of his people, or tend to alter their opinions,
as they rather excited the &s;ecret abhorrence of every hone&s;t man. Yet he
thought this a time favourable for the carrying on his &s;cheme of religion and
ar|bitrary government. An attempt at arbitrary power in Charles was, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, excu&s;able, as he <PB N="73" REF="76"> had a republican faction to
oppo&s;e; and it might have been prudent, at that time, to over&s;tep
ju&s;tice, in order to attain &s;ecurity; but the &s;ame de&s;igns in James
were as unnece&s;&s;ary as impracticable, &s;ince there were few republicans
remaining, and the people were &s;atisfied with limited monarchy. But this weak
and deluded Monarch was re&s;olved to imitate one or two Princes of Europe, who
had ju&s;t before rendered them&s;elves ab&s;olute; and he was incited to this
project by Lewis XIV, who &s;ecretly de&s;ired his de|&s;truction. Thus
in&s;tigated, he began his de&s;igns with the mea&s;ures which he &s;hould not
have u&s;ed till their completion. He &s;ent a &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y to Rome,
to acknowledge his obedience to the Pope. Innocent, who then filled the chair,
was too good a politician to approve tho&s;e childi&s;h mea&s;ures, and gave
his amba&s;&s;ador a very cool reception. He was &s;en&s;ible that the King was
openly &s;triking at tho&s;e laws and opinions which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to
un|dermine in &s;ilence and &s;ecurity. The Cardinals were even heard
facetiou&s;ly to declare, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that the King &s;hould be excommunicated for
thus endeavouring to over|turn the &s;mall remains of Popery that yet
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted in</HI> England.</Q></P>
<P>James, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;couragements, was yet re&s;olved
to pro&s;ecute his favourite &s;cheme with vigour. Upon every occa&s;ion the
Catholics &s;hared his confidence and favour. Hugh Peters, his con|fe&s;&s;or,
ruled his con&s;cience, and drove him blindly forward to attempt innovation. He
became every day more and more ambitious of making converts; the Earl of
Sunderland &s;acrificed his religion to his ambition; the Earl of Roche&s;ter
lo&s;t his employ|ment of trea&s;urer for refu&s;ing to alter his religion. The
King &s;tooped &s;o low as to his officers; a rough &s;oldier one day
an&s;wered his remon&s;trances by &s;ay|ing that he was pre-engaged, for he had
promi&s;ed the King of Morocco, when he was quartered at <PB N="74" REF="77">
Tangiers, that, &s;hould he ever change his religion, he would turn
Mahometan.</P>
<P>An Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court was erected, with power to puni&s;h all
delinquents, or &s;uch &s;o reputed by the court, with all manner of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures. Before this court was &s;ummoned the
Vice-chancellor of Cambridge, for having refu&s;ed to admit one Francis, a
Benedictine Monk, to the degree of ma|&s;ter of arts; the Vice-chancellor was
deprived of his office, but the univer&s;ity per&s;i&s;ted in their re|fu&s;al,
and the King thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e. The
Vice-pre&s;ident and fellows of Magda|len-college in Oxford were treated with
more &s;eve|rity. They refu&s;ed to admit one Farmer, a new convert, and one of
a profligate life, who was nominated by the King to the place of Pre&s;ident,
now become vacant. The King next nominated Parker, Bi&s;hop of Oxford; but he
was equally ob|noxious for the &s;ame rea&s;ons. The King repaired in per&s;on
to Oxford; he reproached the fellows with in&s;olence and di&s;obedience; but
neither he, nor his mini&s;ters, could prevail to alter the re&s;olutions of
this &s;ociety. The fellows were expelled by his or|der, and their places
filled with Papi&s;ts, who he knew would be more obedient to his commands.</P>
<P>His de&s;igns hitherto were &s;ufficiently manife&s;t; but he was
now re&s;olved entirely to throw off the ma&s;k. By his permi&s;&s;ion the
Pope's Nuncio made his public entry into Wind&s;or in his pontificals,
pre|ceded by the cro&s;s, and attended by a great num|ber of monks in the habit
of their re&s;pective orders. He next publi&s;hed a declaration for liberty of
con|&s;cience, by which all re&s;traints upon Popery were taken away. The
Church of England took the alarm; the peculiar animo&s;ity of the people
again&s;t the Catholic religion proceeded not le&s;s from reli|gious than
temporal motives. It is the &s;pirit of that <PB N="75" REF="78"> religion to
favour arbitrary power, and its reproach to encourage per&s;ecution. The
Engli&s;h had too o&s;ten &s;marted under both to be willing again to &s;ub|mit
to either. Seven Bi&s;hops, who had received the King's expre&s;s orders to
cau&s;e this declaration of liberty of con&s;cience to be read in their
churches, refu&s;ed to comply. They drew up a mode&s;t petition to excu&s;e
their refu&s;al, which only &s;erved to increa&s;e the King's re&s;entment and
rage. They were cited before the council, and &s;till adhered to their former
re&s;olution with that firmne&s;s which is the characteri&s;tic of vir|tue. The
Attorney-general was ordered to pro&s;e|cute them for publi&s;hing &s;edition,
and abridging the King's prerogative. They were committed pri&s;oners to the
Tower, conducted thither amid&s;t the prayers and condolence of an incredible
multitude of the populace, who regarded them as &s;ufferers for truth. The day
appointed for their tryal arrived; this cau&s;e was looked upon as the cri&s;is
of Engli&s;h freedom; the council managed the debate on both &s;ides with
learning and candour; the jury withdrew into a chamber, where they pa&s;&s;ed
the whole night, but next morning returned into court, and declared the
Bi&s;hops not guilty. The joy of the people, on this occa&s;ion, was
inexpre&s;&s;ible; the whole city, and the country around, &s;eemed at once to
catch the &s;houts of exultation; they even reached the camp, where the King
was then &s;itting at dinner, who heard them with indignation and
amazement.</P>
<P>If the Bi&s;hops te&s;tified the readine&s;s of martyrs, in
&s;upport of their religion, James &s;hewed no le&s;s ob&s;tinacy in his
attempts towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his own. Finding the clergy aver&s;e
to his de|&s;igns, he next tried what he could do with the army. He thought, if
one regiment would promi&s;e implicit obedience, their example would &s;oon
induce others to the &s;ame compliance. He ordered one of the re|giments to be
drawn up in his pre&s;ence, and de&s;ired <PB N="76" REF="79"> that &s;uch as
were again&s;t his late declaration of li|berty &s;hould lay down their arms.
He was &s;urprized to &s;ee the whole battalion ground their arms, except two
officers and a few Roman Catholic &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition only &s;erved to increa&s;e the infatuated Monarch's
zeal; he was continually &s;timulated by his Queen and his prie&s;ts to proceed
ra&s;hly onward. But he was particularly urged on by the Je&s;uit Pe|ters, his
confe&s;&s;or, an ambitious and intriguing prie&s;t, whom &s;ome hi&s;torians
have even accu&s;ed of being the creature of the Prince of Orange, the King's
&s;on-in-law, who had long &s;ince conceived hopes of &s;eizing the crown.
James now, therefore, i&s;&s;ued orders for pro&s;ecuting all tho&s;e clergymen
who had forborne to read his declaration. He placed one Gifford, a Doctor of
the Sorbonne, at the head of Magdalen College, and likewi&s;e nominated him to
the &s;ee of Oxford, lately become vacant. Every member of the Church of
England now &s;aw their danger; and Whigs and Tories united their efforts to
oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>William, Prince of Orange, had married Mary the daughter of King
James. This Prince had been early immer&s;ed in danger, calamities, and
politics; the de&s;igns of France, and the turbulence of Hol|land, had &s;erved
to &s;harpen his talents, and given him a propen&s;ity for intrigue. This great
politician and &s;oldier concealed beneath a phlegmatic appear|ance, a mo&s;t
violent and boundle&s;s ambition, all his actions were levelled at power, while
his di&s;cour&s;e ne|ver betrayed the wi&s;hes of his heart. His temper was
cold and &s;evere, his genius active and piercing; he was valiant without
o&s;tentation, and politic without addre&s;s; di&s;daining the plea&s;ures, or
the elegancies of life, yet eager after the phantom of pre-eminence. He was no
&s;tranger to the murmurs of the Engli&s;h, and was re&s;olved to turn them to
his intere&s;t. He <PB N="77" REF="80"> therefore accepted the invitations of
the nobility and others, and &s;till more willingly embarked in the cau&s;e, as
he found the malecontents had concerted their mea&s;ures with prudence and
&s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>A fleet was equipped &s;ufficient to tran&s;port fifteen thou&s;and
troops; and it was at fir&s;t given out that this armament was de&s;igned
again&s;t France. James, at length, began to &s;ee his own errors and the
di&s;|contents of the people; he would now have retracted his mea&s;ures in
favour of Popery, but it was too late; the fleet of the Prince was already
&s;ailed, and had landed thirteen thou&s;and troops at the village of Broxholme
in Torbay.</P>
<P>The expectations of the Prince of Orange &s;eemed, at fir&s;t, to be
fru&s;trated; very few Engli&s;hmen of|fered him their &s;ervices, though the
people were, in general, well affected to his de&s;ign. Slight repul&s;es were
not &s;ufficient to intimidate a general who had, from early youth, encountered
adver&s;ity; he conti|nued ten days in expectation of being joined by the
malecontents without &s;ucce&s;s; but, ju&s;t when he be|gan to deliberate
about reimbarking his forces, he was joined by &s;everal per&s;ons of
con&s;equence, and the country people came flocking to his &s;tandard. From
this day his numbers began to increa&s;e; the nobility, which had compo&s;ed
the court and council of King James, now left their old Ma&s;ter to &s;olicit
protection from the new.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV. had long fore&s;een this defection, and had formerly
offered the King thirty thou&s;and men for his &s;ecurity. This was then
refu&s;ed by James, by the advice of Sunderland, his favourite, who was
&s;ecretly in the intere&s;ts of the Prince of Orange. James, however, now
reque&s;ted a&s;&s;i&s;tance from France, when it was too late for his
&s;ervice: he wrote in vain to Leopold, Emperor of Germany, who only returned
for an&s;wer, that what he had fore&s;een had happened. He had &s;ome
dependence on his fleet, <PB N="78" REF="81"> but they were entirely
di&s;affected. In a word, his intere&s;ts were de&s;erted by all; for he had
long de|&s;erted them him&s;elf. He was at the head of an army of twenty
thou&s;and men, and it is po&s;&s;ible that, had he led them to the combat
without granting them time for deliberation, they might have fought in his
favour; but he was involved in a maze of fears and &s;u&s;picions; the
defection of tho&s;e he mo&s;t con|fided in took away his power of
deliberation, and his perplexity was increa&s;ed, when told that the Prince of
Denmark and Anne, his favourite daughter, had gone over to the Prince of
Orange. In this exigence he could not repre&s;s his tears, but in the agony of
his heart was heard to exclaim, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>God help me, my own children have for&s;aken
me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He now hung over the precipice of de&s;truction! invaded by one
&s;on-in-law, abandoned by another, hated by his &s;ubjects, and dete&s;ted by
tho&s;e who had &s;uffered beneath his cruelty. He a&s;&s;embled the few
noblemen who &s;till adhered to his intere&s;ts, and de|manded their advice and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the Earl of Bedford, father to
Lord Ru&s;&s;el, who was beheaded by James's intrigues in the pre|ceding reign,

<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you are an hone&s;t
man, have great credit, and can do me &s;ignal &s;ervice.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ah, Sir,</HI> replied the Earl, <HI>I am old and
feeble, I can do you but little &s;ervice; but I once had a &s;on that could
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted you, but he is no more.</HI></Q> James was &s;o &s;truck
with this reply, that he could not &s;peak for &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>The King was naturally timid; and &s;ome coun&s;el|lors about him,
either &s;haring his fears, or bribed by the Prince, contributed to increa&s;e
his apprehen&s;ions. They reminded him of the fate of Charles I, and
ag|gravated the turbulence of the people. He was, at length, per&s;uaded to
think of flying from a nation he could no longer govern, and of taking refuge
at the court of France, where he was &s;ure of finding <PB N="79" REF="82">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection. Thus in&s;tructed, he fir&s;t &s;ent away his
Queen, who arrived &s;afely at Calais; and &s;oon after, di&s;gui&s;ing
him&s;elf in a plain dre&s;s, he went down to Fever&s;ham, and embarked on
board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el for France. His misfortunes &s;till con|tinued to
follow him; the ve&s;&s;el was detained by the common people, who not knowing
their Sovereign, robbed, in&s;ulted, and abu&s;ed him. He was now per|&s;uaded
by the Earl of Winchel&s;ea to return to Lon|don, where he was once more
received amid&s;t the acclamations of the people.</P>
<P>The return of James was by no means agreeable to William, though he
well knew how to di&s;&s;emble. It was his intere&s;t and his de&s;ign to
increa&s;e the for|&s;aken Monarch's apprehen&s;ions, &s;o as to induce him to
fly. He therefore received the news of his return with a haughty air, and
ordered him to leave White|hall, and retire to Richmond. The King
remon|&s;trated again&s;t Richmond, and de&s;ired that Roche&s;ter might be
appointed as the place of his abode. The Prince perceived his intention was to
leave the king|dom; nor did one wi&s;h for flight more ardently than did the
other de&s;ire him away. The King &s;oon con|curred with his de&s;igns: after
&s;taying but a &s;hort time at Roche&s;ter, he fled to the &s;ea-&s;ide,
attended by his natural &s;on the Duke of Berwick, where he embarked for
France, and arrived in &s;afety, to en|joy, for the re&s;t of life, the empty
title of a King, and the appellation of a Saint, a title which &s;till
flat|tered him more. Here he continued to re&s;ide among a people who pitied,
ridiculed, and de&s;pi&s;ed him. He inrolled him&s;elf in the order of
Je&s;uits; and the court of Rome, for whom he had lo&s;t all, repaid him only
with indulgences and pa&s;quinades.</P>
<P>From this moment the con&s;titution of England, that had fluctuated
for &s;o many ages, was fixed. The nation, repre&s;ented by its parliament,
deter|mined <PB N="80" REF="83"> the long conte&s;ted limits between the King
and the people; they pre&s;cribed to the Prince of Orange the terms by which he
was to rule; they cho&s;e him for King, jointly with Mary, who was the next
Prote&s;tant heir to the crown. They were crowned with titles of William III.
and Mary, King and Queen of England. The Prince &s;aw his ambi|tion, at length,
gratified; and his wi&s;dom was repaid with that crown which the folly of his
predece&s;&s;or had given away.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH William was cho&s;en King of Eng|land, his power was limited
on every &s;ide; and the oppo&s;ition he met with from his parliaments &s;till
le&s;&s;ened the regal authority. His &s;way in Hol|land, where he was but the
Stadtholder, was far more arbitrary; &s;o that he might, with greater
propriety, have been called the King of the United Provinces, and the
Stadtholder of England. He was not &s;uffi|ciently acquainted with the
difficulty of governing the nation by which he was elected; he expected in them
a people ready to &s;econd the views of his am|bition in humbling France; but
he found them more apt to fear for the inva&s;ion of their dome&s;tic liberties
from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His reign commenced, however, with the &s;ame attempt which had been
the principal cau&s;e of all the di&s;turbances in the preceding reign, and had
ex|cluded the Monarch from the throne. William was a Calvini&s;t, and naturally
aver&s;e to per&s;ecution. He therefore began by attempting to repeal tho&s;e
laws that enjoined uniformity of wor&s;hip; and, though he could not entirely
&s;ucceed in his de&s;ign, yet a tole|ration <PB N="81" REF="84"> was granted
to &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters as &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no
private conven|ticles. The Papi&s;ts al&s;o enjoyed the lenity of his
government; and, though the laws again&s;t them con|tinued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
yet they were &s;eldom put into rigo|rous execution. What was criminal in James
was virtuous in his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: James only wanted to in|troduce
per&s;ecution by pretending to di&s;own it; Wil|liam was aver&s;e to
per&s;ecution from principle; and none &s;uffered for religious opinions during
his reign.</P>
<P>But, though William was acknowledged in Eng|land, Scotland was
&s;till undetermined. The parlia|ment of that country, however, &s;oon
recognized his authority, and took that opportunity to aboli&s;h epi&s;|copacy,
which had been long di&s;agreeable to the na|tion. Nothing now remained to the
depo&s;ed Mo|narch, of all his former dominions, but Ireland. His cau&s;e was
e&s;pou&s;ed by all the Catholics of that coun|try, who were much more numerous
there than tho&s;e of the Prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion. The King of France,
either touched with compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;ufferings, or willing to weaken a
rival kingdom by internal di&s;|&s;en&s;ions, granted James a fleet and &s;ome
troops, to a&s;&s;ert his claims there. On the &s;eventh day of May this
unhappy Monarch embarked at Bre&s;t, and on the twenty-&s;econd arrived at
Kin&s;ale. He was re|ceived by the Catholics of Ireland with open arms. The
Prote&s;tants, who were unanimou&s;ly attached to King William, had been
previou&s;ly di&s;armed by Tyr|connel, their Lord-lieutenant, and a Papi&s;t.
James made his public entry into Dublin amid&s;t the accla|mations of the
inhabitants. He was met by a Popi&s;h proce&s;&s;ion, bearing the ho&s;t, which
he publicly adored; and this &s;erved to alienate the few Prote&s;tants of that
kingdom, who &s;till adhered to his cau&s;e. A &s;mall party of that religion
were re&s;olved to defend their lives and religion in the little city of
London-derry. They were be&s;ieged by the forces of King <PB N="82" REF="85">
James, and &s;uffered all the complicated mi&s;eries of war, famine, and
bigotted cruelty; but, deter|mined never to yield, they rejected capitulation,
and always repul&s;ed the be&s;iegers with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. At length,
&s;upplies and &s;uccours arriving from Eng|land, King James's army thought
proper to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>The cruelties exerci&s;ed upon the Prote&s;tants were as &s;hocking
as unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;oldiers were permitted to pillage them without
redre&s;s; and they were com|pelled to accept ba&s;e money in exchange for
tho&s;e commodities they were forced to &s;ell. But their &s;uf|ferings were
&s;oon to have a period. The Duke of Schomberg was &s;ent over, with
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and Wil|liam him&s;elf &s;oon after followed, and landed at
Car|rickfergus. He was met by numbers of the Prote&s;|tants, who had fled from
per&s;ecution; and now, at the head of &s;ix-and-thirty thou&s;and men, he was
re|&s;olved to go in que&s;t of the enemy. Having march|ed to Dundalk, and then
to Ardee, he, at length, came in &s;ight of the Iri&s;h army. The river Boyne
lay between the two armies, the front of the Iri&s;h being &s;ecured by a
mora&s;s and a ri&s;ing ground. The&s;e ob&s;tacles were in&s;ufficient to
prevent the ar|dour of William, who, when his friend the Duke of Schomberg
expo&s;tulated upon the danger boldly, repli|ed, That a tardy victory would be
wor&s;e than a defeat. The Duke, finding his advice not reli&s;hed, retired to
his tent in a melancholy manner, as if he had a pre&s;cience of his own
misfortune. Early in the morning, at &s;ix o'clock, King William gave orders to
pa&s;s the river; the army pa&s;&s;ed in three different places, and the battle
began with unu&s;ual vigour. The Iri&s;h troops, which have been reckoned the
be&s;t in Europe abroad, have always fought indiffer|ently at home; they fled,
after a long re&s;i&s;tance, with precipitation, and left the French and
Swi&s;s regi|ments, who came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make the 
<PB N="83" REF="86"> be&s;t retreat they could. William led on his hor&s;e in
per&s;on, and contributed, by his activity and vigilance, to &s;ecure the
victory. James was not in the battle, but &s;tood aloof, during the action, on
the hill of Dunmore, &s;urrounded with &s;ome &s;quadrons of hor&s;e; and, at
intervals, was heard to exclaim, when he &s;aw his own troops repul&s;ing the
enemy, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O &s;pare my Eng|li&s;h &s;ubjects.</HI></Q> The
Iri&s;h lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men, and the Engli&s;h about one third of
that num|ber; but the death of the Duke of Schomberg, who was &s;hot as he was
cro&s;&s;ing the water, &s;eemed to out|weigh all the numbers of the enemy. He
had been long a &s;oldier of fortune, and fought under almo&s;t every power in
Europe. His &s;kill in war was un|paralleled, and his fidelity equal to his
courage. The number of battles in which he had been per|&s;onally engaged, was
&s;aid to equal the number of his years; and he died aged eighty-two. James
fled, regardle&s;s of the &s;afety of his &s;oldiers. William rode round the
&s;cene of &s;laughter, relieving the wounded, as well of the enemy's troops as
his own. O Regan, an old Iri&s;h captain, was heard to &s;ay upon this
oc|ca&s;ion, That, if the Engli&s;h would exchange gene|rals, the conquered
army would fight the battle over again.</P>
<P>This blow totally depre&s;&s;ed the hopes of James; he fled to
Dublin, advi&s;ed the magi&s;trates to get the be&s;t terms they could from the
victor, then &s;et out for Waterford, where he embarked for France, in a
ve&s;&s;el prepared for his reception. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either conduct
or courage, he might &s;till have headed his troops, and fought with advantage;
but prudence for&s;ook him with good fortune.</P>
<P>His friends were &s;till re&s;olved to &s;econd his inter|e&s;ts,
though he had abandoned them him&s;elf. After his retreat, another de&s;perate
battle was fought at Aughrim, in which his adver&s;aries were again
victo|rious; Limeric, a &s;trong city in the &s;outhern part of 
<PB N="84" REF="87"> the kingdom, &s;till held out in his favour. This city was
be&s;ieged, and made a brave defence; but, de|&s;pairing of the King's
fortunes, the garri&s;on, at length, capitulated; the Roman Catholics, by this
capitulation, were re&s;tored to the enjoyment of &s;uch liberty in the
exerci&s;e of their religion, as they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the reign of
Charles II; and about fourteen thou&s;and of tho&s;e who had fought in favour
of King James, had permi&s;&s;ion to go over to France, and tran&s;ports were
provided for their reception.</P>
<P>The conqueft o&s; Ireland being thus completed, the only hopes of
the fugitive King now depended on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lewis XIV, who
promi&s;ed to make a de&s;cent upon England in his favour. The French King was
punctual; he &s;upplied the fugitive Monarch with an army con&s;i&s;ting of a
body of French troops, &s;ome Engli&s;h and Scotch refugees, and the Iri&s;h
regiments which had been tran&s;ported from Limeric into France, by long
difcipline, now become excellent &s;oldiers. This army was a&s;&s;embled
between Cherbourg and La Hogue; King James commanded it in per&s;on; and more
than three hundred tran&s;ports were provided for landing it on the Engli&s;h
&s;hore. Tourville, the French admiral, at the head of &s;ixty-three &s;hips of
the line, was appointed to favour the de&s;cent, and had orders to attack the
enemy, if they &s;hould attempt to oppo&s;e him. All things con&s;pired to
revive the hopes of the hitherto unfortunate King.</P>
<P>The&s;e preparations on the &s;ide of France were &s;oon known at
the court of England, and precautions were taken for a vigorous oppo&s;ition;
all the &s;ecret machinations of the bani&s;hed King's adherents were early
di&s;covered to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try by &s;pies; and they took proper
mea&s;ures to defeat them. Ad|miral Ru&s;&s;el was ordered to put to &s;ea with
all po&s;|&s;ible expedition; and he &s;oon appeared with ninety-nine &s;hips
of the line, be&s;ides frigates and fire&s;hips. Both fleets met at La Hogue.
On the &s;ucce&s;s of <PB N="85" REF="88"> this engagement all the hopes of
James depended; but the victory was on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, and of
num|bers; the fight continued ten hours, and the pur&s;uit two days; fifteen
French men of war were de&s;troyed; and the blow was &s;o deci&s;ive, that from
that time France &s;eemed to relinqui&s;h her claims to the ocean.</P>
<P>James was now reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of de|&s;pondence; his
de&s;igns upon England were quite fru&s;trated; nothing was now left his
friends but ter|rors and de&s;pair, or the hopes of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the
Monarch on the throne. The&s;e ba&s;e attempts, as barbarous as they were
u&s;ele&s;s, were not intirely di&s;|agreeable to the temper of James: it is
&s;aid, he en|couraged and propo&s;ed them; but they all ended in the
de&s;truction of their undertakers. He pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of his days at St.
Germains, a pen&s;ioner on the bounties of Lewis, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
occa&s;ional libera|lities from his daughter, and friends in England. He died
in 1700, at St. Germains. Some pretend that miracles were wrought at his tomb.
We have &s;een few depo&s;ed Kings that have not died with a reputa|tion for
&s;anctity.</P>
<P>The defeat at La Hogue confirmed King William's &s;afety and title
to the crown: the Jacobites were now a feeble and a di&s;united faction; new
parties therefore aro&s;e among tho&s;e who had been friends of the revolution,
and William found as much oppo|&s;ition from his parliament at home, as from
the ene|my in the field. His chief motive for accepting the crown was to engage
England more deeply in the concerns of Europe. It had ever been his ambition to
humble the French, whom he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formidable enemies of
that liberty which he idolized; and all his politics lay in making alliances
again&s;t them. Many of the Engli&s;h, on the other hand, had neither the
&s;ame animo&s;ity again&s;t the French, nor the &s;ame terrors of their
increa&s;ing power; they therefore con&s;idered the intere&s;ts of the 
<PB N="86" REF="89"> nation as &s;acrificed to foreign connections, and
com|plained, that the war on the continent fell mo&s;t hea|vily on them, though
they had the lea&s;t intere&s;t in its &s;ucce&s;s. To the&s;e motives of
di&s;content was added his partiality to his own countrymen, in pre|judice of
Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, together with his proud re&s;erve and &s;ullen &s;ilence,
&s;o unlike the behaviour of all their former Kings. William heard their
complaints with the mo&s;t phlegmatic indifference; the intere&s;ts of Europe
alone employed all his atten|tion; but, while he ince&s;&s;antly waked over the
&s;chemes of contending Kings and nations, he was unmindful of the cultivation
of internal polity. Pa|trioti&s;m was ridiculed as an ideal virtue; the
prac|tice of bribing a majority in parliament became uni|ver&s;al. The example
of the great was caught up by the vulgar; all principle, and even decency, was
gradually bani&s;hed; talents lay uncultivated; and the ignorant and profligate
were received into favour.</P>
<P>William, upon accepting the crown, was re&s;olved to pre&s;erve, as
much as he was able, the privileges of a Sovereign. He was, as yet, intirely
unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy, which was not then
thoroughly under&s;tood in any part of Eu|rope, except England alone. He
therefore often controverted the views of his parliament, and was directed by
arbitrary councils. One of the fir&s;t in|&s;tances of this was, in the
oppo&s;ition he gave to the bill for triennial parliaments; it had pa&s;t the
two hou&s;es, and was &s;ent up to receive the royal a&s;&s;ent, which William
refu&s;ed to grant; the commons then voted, that whoever advi&s;ed the King to
this mea|&s;ure, was an enemy to his country. The bill, thus rejected, lay
dormant for another &s;ea&s;on; and, being again brought in, the King found
him&s;elf obliged, though reluctantly, to comply. The &s;ame oppo&s;i|tion, and
the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, attended a bill for regu|lating tryals in ca&s;es of
high trea&s;on, by which the <PB N="87" REF="90"> accu&s;ed was allowed a copy
of his indictment, and a li&s;t of the names of his jury, two days before his
tryal, together with council to plead in his de|fence. That no per&s;on
&s;hould be indicted, but upon the oaths of two faithful witne&s;&s;es. This
was one of the mo&s;t &s;alutary laws that had been long enact|ed; but, while
penal &s;tatutes were mitigated on one hand, they were &s;trangely increa&s;ed
by a number of others.</P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of the parliament, from this period, &s;eemed
to con&s;i&s;t in re&s;training corrup|tion, and bringing &s;uch to ju&s;tice,
as had grown wealthy from the plunder of the public. The num|ber of laws that
were now enacted every &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;eemed calculated for the &s;afety of
the &s;ubject; but, in reality, were &s;ymptoms of the univer&s;al corrup|tion.
The more corrupt the commonwealth, the more numerous are the laws.</P>
<P>William was willing to admit all the re&s;traints they cho&s;e to
lay on the royal prerogative in Eng|land, upon condition of being properly
&s;upplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War, and foreign
politics, were all he knew, or de&s;ired to under&s;tand. The &s;ums of money
granted him for the pro&s;ecution of this war were incredible; and the nation,
not contented with furni&s;hing him with &s;uch &s;upplies as they were
immediately capable of rai&s;ing, involved them&s;elves in debts, which they
have never &s;ince been able to di&s;charge. For all this profu|&s;ion England
received, in return, the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the
con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of having given the Dutch, whom they &s;aved, frequent
opportunities of being ungrateful.</P>
<P>The treaty of Ry&s;wick, at length, put an end to a war, in which
England had engaged without in|tere&s;t, and came off without advantage. In the
ge|neral pacification her intere&s;ts &s;eemed intirely de|&s;erted; and, for
all her blood and trea&s;ure, the only <PB N="88" REF="91"> equivalent &s;he
received, was, the King of France's acknowledgment of King William's title to
the crown.</P>
<P>The King, now freed from a foreign war, laid him&s;elf out to
&s;trengthen his authority at home. He conceived hopes of keeping up the forces
that were granted him, in time of war, during the conti|nuance of the peace;
but he was not a little mor|tified to find that the commons had pa&s;&s;ed a
vote, that all the forces in Engli&s;h pay, exceeding &s;even thou&s;and men,
&s;hould be forthwith di&s;banded; and that tho&s;e retained &s;hould be
natural Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects. A &s;tanding army was this Monarch's greate&s;t
delight; he had been bred up in camps, and knew no other plea&s;ure but that of
reviewing troops, or dictating to generals. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
therefore entirely di&s;plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al; and his indig|nation was
kindled to &s;uch a pitch, that he actually conceived a de&s;ign of abandoning
the government. His mini&s;ters, however, diverted him from this re|&s;olution,
and per&s;uaded him to con&s;ent to pa&s;&s;ing the bill. Such were the
altercations between the King and his parliament; which continued dur|ing his
reign. He con&s;idered his commons as a &s;et of men de&s;irous of power, and
con&s;equently re&s;olved upon ob&s;tructing all his projects. He &s;eemed but
little attached to any party in the hou&s;e; he veered from Whigs to Tories, as
intere&s;t, or immediate exi|gence, demanded. England he con&s;idered as a
place of labour, anxiety, and altercation. He u&s;ed to re|tire to his &s;eat
at Loo in Holland, for tho&s;e moments which he dedicated to plea&s;ure or
tranquility. It was in this quiet retreat he planned the different
&s;ucce&s;|&s;ions of Europe, and laboured to undermine the po|litics of Lewis
XIV, his in&s;idious rival in power, and in fame. Again&s;t France his
re&s;entment was ever levelled, and he had made vigorous preparations for
entering into a new war with that kingdom, <PB N="89" REF="92"> when death
interrupted the execution of his &s;chemes. He was naturally of a very feeble
con&s;titution, and it was now almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by a life of continual
action and care. He endeavoured to conceal the defects of his infirmities, and
repair his health by riding. In one of his excur&s;ions to Hampton-court, his
hor&s;e fell under him, and he him&s;elf was thrown off with &s;uch violence
that his collar-bone was frac|tured. This, in a robu&s;t con&s;titution, would
have been a trifling misfortune, but to him it was fatal. Perceiving his end
approach, the objects of his for|mer care &s;till lay next his heart; the
intere&s;ts of Europe &s;till filled him with concern. The Earl of Albemarle
arriving from Holland, he conferred with him in private on the po&s;ture of
affairs abroad. Two days after, having received the &s;acrament from
Arch|bi&s;hop Tenni&s;on, he expired, in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age,
after having reigned thirteen years.</P>
<P>William left behind him the character of a great politician, though
he had never been popular; and a formidable general, though he was &s;eldom
victo|rious; his deportment was grave and &s;ullen, nor did he ever &s;hew any
fire, but in the day of battle. He de|&s;pi&s;ed flattery, yet loved dominion.
Greater as the general of Holland, than the King of England; to the one he was
a father, to the other a fu&s;picious friend. He &s;crupled not to employ the
engines of corruption to gain his ends; and, while he increa&s;ed the power of
the nation he was brought to govern, he contributed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to
corrupt their morals.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by the death of Princes are not
&s;o great, or &s;o &s;incere, as the &s;ufferers would fondly per&s;uade us.
The lo&s;s of King William was, at fir&s;t thought, irreparable; but the
pro&s;perity of the kingdom &s;eemed to acquire new vigour under his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or Queen Anne. This Prince&s;s was the &s;econd daughter of King
James by his fir&s;t wife; &s;he was, by the mother's &s;ide de&s;cended from
Chan|cellor Hyde, afterwards the Earl of Clarendon; and had been married to the
Prince of Denmark, before her acce&s;&s;ion to the crown. She a&s;cended the
throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, having under|gone many
vici&s;&s;itudes after the expul&s;ion of her father, and many &s;evere
mortifications during the reign of the late King. But, naturally
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an even &s;erene temper, &s;he either was in&s;en&s;ible
of the di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn her, or had wi&s;dom to conceal her
re&s;entment.</P>
<P>She came to the throne with the &s;ame ho&s;tile di&s;|po&s;itions
toward France, in which the late Monarch died. She was wholly guided by the
Counte&s;s of Marlborough, a woman of ma&s;culine &s;pirit, and re|markable for
intrigue, both in politics and gallantry. This lady advi&s;ed a vigorous
exertion of the Engli&s;h power again&s;t France, as &s;he had already marked
the Earl, her hu&s;band, for conducting all the opera|tions both in the cabinet
and the field. Thus in|fluenced, the Queen took early mea&s;ures to confirm her
allies, the Dutch, with a&s;&s;urances of union and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV, now grown familiar with di&s;appoint|ment and di&s;grace,
yet &s;till &s;purring on an exhau&s;ted kingdom to &s;econd the views of his
ambition, expect|ed, from the death of King William, a field open for
conque&s;ts and glory. The vigilance of his late rival <PB N="91" REF="94"> had
bla&s;ted his laurels, and circum&s;cribed his power; for, even after a defeat,
William &s;till was formidable. At the news of his death therefore the French
Mo|narch could not &s;uppre&s;s his joy, and his court at Ver&s;ailles &s;eemed
to have forgotten its u&s;ual decorum in the &s;incerity of their rapture. But
their plea&s;ure was &s;oon to determine; a much more formidable ene|my was now
ri&s;ing up to oppo&s;e them; a more able warrior, one backed by the efforts of
an indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s and a willing nation.</P>
<P>Immediately, upon the Queen's acce&s;&s;ion, war was declared
again&s;t the French King, and that Mo|narch was accu&s;ed of attempting to
unite the crown of Spain to his own dominions, by placing his grand|&s;on upon
the throne of that kingdom; thus attempt|ing to de&s;troy the equality of power
among the &s;tates of Europe. This declaration was &s;oon &s;econded with
vigorous efforts; an alliance was formed be|tween the Imperiali&s;ts, the
Dutch, and the Engli&s;h, who contributed more to the &s;upport of the war than
the other two united. Marlborough was &s;ent over to command the Engli&s;h
army, and the allies declared him generali&s;&s;imo of all their forces. Never
was a man better calculated for debate and action than he; &s;e|rene in the
mid&s;t of danger, and cool in all the fury of battle. While his Counte&s;s
governed the Queen, his intrigues governed the kingdom. An indefati|gable
warrior while in camp, and a &s;kilful politician in courts; he thus became the
mo&s;t fatal enemy to France that England had produced, &s;ince the con|quering
times of Cre&s;&s;y and Agincourt.</P>
<P>This general had learned the art of war under the famous Mar&s;hal
Turenne, having been a voluntier in his army. He, at that time, went by the
name of the <HI>Hand&s;ome Engli&s;hman;</HI> but Turenne fore&s;aw his future
greatne&s;s. He now gave the fir&s;t proofs of his wi&s;dom by advancing the
&s;ubaltern officers, who&s;e merit had hitherto been neglected; he gained the 
<PB N="92" REF="95"> enemy's po&s;ts without fighting, ever advancing, and
never lo&s;ing one advantage which he had gained. To this general was
oppo&s;ed, on the &s;ide of France, the Duke of Burgundy, grand&s;on of the
King, a youth more qualified to grace a court, than conduct an army; the
Mar&s;hal Bouflers commanded under him, a man of courage and activity. But
the&s;e quali|ties in both were forced to give way to the &s;uperior powers of
their adver&s;ary; after having been forced to retire by the &s;kilful marches
of Marlborough, af|ter having &s;een &s;everal towns taken, they gave up all
hopes of acting offen&s;ively, and concluded the campaign with re&s;olutions to
pro&s;ecute the next with greater vigour.</P>
<P>Marlborough, upon his return to London, re|ceived the rewards of his
merit, being thanked by the hou&s;e of commons, and created a Duke by the
Queen. The &s;ucce&s;s of one campaign ever &s;purs on the Engli&s;h to aim at
new triumphs. Marlborough next &s;ea&s;on returned to the field, with larger
autho|rity, and greater confidence from his former &s;ucce&s;s. He began the
campaign by taking Bonne, the re&s;idence of the Elector of Cologne; he next
retook Huys, Limbourg, and became ma&s;ter of all the Lower Rhine. The
Mar&s;hal Villeroy, &s;on to the King of France's governor, and educated with
him, was now general of the French army. He was ever a favourite of Lewis, had
&s;hared his plea&s;ures and his campaigns. He was brave, virtuous, and polite;
but unequal to the great ta&s;k of command; and &s;till more &s;o, when
oppo&s;ed to &s;o great a rival.</P>
<P>Marlborough, &s;en&s;ible of the abilities of his an|tagoni&s;t, was
re&s;olved, in&s;tead of immediately op|po&s;ing him, to fly to the &s;uccour
of the Emperor, his ally, who loudly reque&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being
pre&s;&s;|ed on every &s;ide by a victorious enemy. The Eng|li&s;h general was
re&s;olved to &s;trike a vigorous blow for his relief, took with him about
thirteen thou&s;and <PB N="93" REF="96"> Engli&s;h troops, traver&s;ed
exten&s;ive countries with an ha&s;ty march, arrived at the banks of the
Danube, defeated a body of French and Bavarians &s;tationed at Donavert to
oppo&s;e him, pa&s;&s;ed the Danube, and laid the Dukedom of Bavaria, that had
&s;ided with the French, under contribution. Villeroy, who at fir&s;t attempted
to follow his motions, &s;eemed, all at once, to have lo&s;t &s;ight of his
enemy; nor was he apprized of his route, till he was informed of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Tallard prepared, by another route, to ob&s;truct the Duke
of Marlborough's retreat, with thirty thou&s;and men. He was &s;oon after
joined by the Duke of Bavaria's forces; &s;o that the French army amounted to a
body of &s;ixty thou&s;and di&s;ci|plined veterans, commanded by the two be&s;t
reputed generals at that time in France. Tallard had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed his
reputation by former victories; he was active, penetrating, and had ri&s;en by
the dint of me|rit alone. But this ardour often ro&s;e to impetuo&s;i|ty; and
he was &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted as to be unable to di&s;tingui&s;h at the
&s;malle&s;t di&s;tance; and the Duke was remarkable for his re&s;olution and
per&s;onal bra|very. On the other hand, the Duke of Marlbo|rough was now joined
by the Prince Eugene, a ge|neral bred up from his infancy in camps, and equal
to Marlborough in intrigue and military knowledge. Their talents were
congenial; and all their de&s;igns &s;eemed to flow but from one &s;ource.
Their army, when combined, amounted to about fifty-two thou|&s;and men; troops
that had been accu&s;tomed to con|quer, and had &s;een the French, the Turks,
and the Ru&s;&s;ians fly before them. As this battle, both from the talents of
the generals, the improvements in the art of war, the number and di&s;cipline
of the troops, and the greatne&s;s of the contending powers, is reckoned the
mo&s;t remarkable of this century, it demands a more particular detail.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97"> The French were po&s;ted on an hill, their
right being covered by the Danube, and the village of Blenheim, and commanded
by Mar&s;hal Tallard; their left was defended by a village, and headed by the
Elector and Mar&s;in, an experienced French ge|neral. In the front of their
army ran a rivulet, the banks of which were &s;teep, and the bottom mar&s;hy.
Marlborough and Eugene went together to ob&s;erve the po&s;ture of the French
forces. Notwith&s;tanding their advantageous &s;ituation, they were re&s;olved
to attack them immediately. The battle began between twelve and one in the
afternoon. Marlborough, at the head of the Engli&s;h troops, having pa&s;&s;ed
the rivulet, attacked the cavalry of Tallard in the right. This general was at
that time reviewing the di&s;po|&s;ition of his troops in the left; and the
cavalry fought for &s;ome time without the pre&s;ence of their general. Prince
Eugene, on the left, had not yet attacked the forces of the Elector; and it was
an hour before he could bring his forces up to the engagement.</P>
<P>Tallard had no &s;ooner under&s;tood that his right was attacked by
the Duke, but he flew to its head. He found a furious encounter already begun,
his ca|valry thrice repul&s;ed, and rallied as often. He had a large body of
forces in the village of Blenheim; he made an attempt to bring them to the
charge. They were attacked by a part of Marlborough's forces &s;o vigorou&s;ly,
that, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the main body, they could hardly maintain
their ground. All the French cavalry, being now attacked in flank, was totally
defeated. The Engli&s;h army, thus half victo|rious, pierced up between the two
bodies of the French, commanded by the Mar&s;hal and the Elec|tor, while at the
&s;ame time the forces in the village of Blenheim were &s;eparated by another
detachment. In this terrible &s;ituation Tallard flew to rally &s;ome
&s;quadrons, but, from the weakne&s;s of his &s;ight, mi&s;|taking a detachment
of the enemy for his own, he <PB N="95" REF="98"> was taken pri&s;oner by the
He&s;&s;ian troops, who were in Engli&s;h pay. In the mean time, Prince Eu|gene
on the left, after having been thrice repul&s;ed, put the enemy into
confu&s;ion. The rout then be|came general, and the flight precipitate. The
con|&s;ternation was &s;uch that the French &s;oldiers threw them&s;elves into
the Danube, without knowing where they fled. The officers lo&s;t all their
authority; there was no general left to &s;ecure a retreat. The allies were now
ma&s;ters of the field of battle, and &s;ur|rounded the village of Blenheim,
where a body of thirteen thou&s;and had been po&s;ted in the beginning of the
action, and &s;till kept their ground. The&s;e troops, &s;eeing them&s;elves
cut off from all communi|cation with the re&s;t of the army, threw down their
arms, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Thus ended the battle
of Blenheim, one of the mo&s;t complete victories that was ever obtained.
Twelve thou&s;and French and Bavarians were &s;lain in the field, or drowned in
the Danube; thirteen thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners of war. Of the allies
about five thou&s;and men were killed, and eight thou&s;and wounded or
taken.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the battle is imputed to two capital er|rors committed
by Mar&s;hal Tallard; fir&s;t weaken|ing the center by detaching &s;uch a
number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and then &s;uffering the
confederates to pa&s;s the rivulet, and form unmole&s;t|ed. The next day, when
the Duke of Marlborough vi&s;ited his pri&s;oner, the Mar&s;hal paid him the
com|pliment of having overcome the be&s;t troops in the world. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I hope, Sir,</HI> replied the Duke, <HI>you will
except tho&s;e by whom they were conquered.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A country of an hundred leagues extent fell, by this defeat, into
the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ucceeded beyond his hopes, the Duke once more
returned to England, where he found the people in a tran&s;port of joy; he was
welcomed as an <PB N="96" REF="99"> hero, who had retrieved the glory of the
nation; and the Queen, the parliament, and the people were ready to &s;econd
him in all his de&s;igns. The manor of Wood&s;tock was conferred upon him for
his &s;er|vices; and the Lord-keeper, in the name of the Peers, honoured him
with that prai&s;e he &s;o well de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign induced the Engli&s;h to
increa&s;e their &s;upplies for the next, and the Duke had fixed upon the
Mo&s;elle for the &s;cene of action; but being di&s;appointed by Prince Lewis,
who promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he returned to the Ne|therlands to
oppo&s;e Villeroy, who, in his ab&s;ence, undertook the &s;iege of Liege.
Villeroy, having re|ceived advice of the Duke's approach, abandoned his
enterprize, and retreated within his lines. Marlbo|rough was re&s;olved to
force them. He led his troops to the charge; after a warm but &s;hort
engagement the enemy's hor&s;e were defeated with great &s;laughter. The
infantry, being abandoned, retreated in great di&s;order to an advantageous
po&s;t, where they again drew up in order of battle. Had the Duke been
per|mitted to take advantage of their con&s;ternation, as he propo&s;ed, it is
po&s;&s;ible he might have gained a com|plete victory; but he was oppo&s;ed by
the Dutch offi|cers, who repre&s;ented it in &s;uch a light to the Depu|ties of
the States, that they refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to its execution. This timidity
was highly re&s;ented in England, and laid the fir&s;t foundation of
&s;u&s;pecting the Dutch fidelity; they were &s;ecretly accu&s;ed of a de&s;ire
to protract the war, by which they alone of all the powers of Europe were
gainers.</P>
<P>While the arms of England were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in the
Netherlands, they were not le&s;s for|tunate in Spain, where efforts were made
to fix Charles, Duke of Au&s;tria, upon the throne. The greate&s;t part of that
kingdom had declared in favour of Philip IV, grand&s;on to Lewis XIV, who had 
<PB N="97" REF="100"> been nominated &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the late King of
Spain's will. We have already &s;een, that, by a former treaty among the powers
of Europe, Charles of Au|&s;tria was appointed heir to that crown; and this
treaty had been guarantied by France her&s;elf, who now intended to rever&s;e
it in favour of a de&s;cendant of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Charles, therefore
entered Spain, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the arms of England; and invited by the
Catalonians, who had declared in his favour. He was furni&s;hed with two
hundred tran&s;ports, thirty &s;hips of war, nine thou&s;and men, and the Earl
of Peterborough, a man of even romantic bravery, was placed at their head.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t exploits of the&s;e forces was to take Gibraltar,
which had hitherto been deemed impreg|nable. A ledge of lofty rocks defended it
almo&s;t on every &s;ide by land, and an open and &s;tormy bay took away all
&s;ecurity for &s;hipping by &s;ea. A few troops were therefore capable of
defending it again&s;t the mo&s;t numerous armies. The &s;ecurity of the
garri|&s;on proved their ruin. A detachment of eighteen hundred marines were
landed upon that neck of level ground which joins it to the continent. The&s;e
were incapable of attempting any thing effectual, and even de&s;titute of hopes
of &s;ucceeding. A body of &s;ailors, in boats, were ordered to attack an
half-ruined mole; they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the platform, unterrified by
a mine that blew up an hundred men in the air; with the utmo&s;t intrepidity
they kept their ground, and, being &s;oon joined by other &s;eamen, took a
redoubt, be|tween the mole and the town, by &s;torm. The go|vernor was now
obliged to capitulate; and the Prince of He&s;&s;e entered the town, amazed at
the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;o de&s;perate an enterprize. This was a glorious and an
u&s;eful acqui&s;ition to the Briti&s;h dominions; their trade to the
Mediterranean was thus &s;ecured; and they had here a repo&s;itory capable of
containing all <PB N="98" REF="101"> things nece&s;&s;ary for the repairing of
fleets, or the equipment of armies.</P>
<P>Soon after the taking this important garri&s;on, the Engli&s;h
fleet, now mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;eas, attacked the French Admiral, who
commanded fifty-two &s;hips of war. After an ob&s;tinate conte&s;t the
Engli&s;h became victorious; the French fleet &s;ailed away, nor could it be
brought again to the engagement, though the lo&s;&s;es on either &s;ide were
equal. This may be rec|koned the final effort of France by &s;ea: in all
&s;ub|&s;equent engagements their chief care was rather to con&s;ult means of
e&s;cape than of victory. Nor yet were the French and Spaniards willing to
&s;uffer Gibraltar to be taken, without an effort for repri&s;al. Philip &s;ent
an army to retake it, and France a fleet of thir|teen &s;hips of the line; both
were equally un&s;ucce&s;s|ful; part of the fleet was di&s;per&s;ed by a
tempe&s;t, and another part taken by the Engli&s;h; while the army, having made
little or no progre&s;s by land, was oblig|ed to abandon the enterprize.</P>
<P>Nor were the Engli&s;h le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in a&s;&s;erting the
title of Charles to the kingdom. Their army was commanded by the Earl of
Peterborough, one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary men of the age. At
fifteen he fought again&s;t the Moors in Africa; at twenty he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in
compa&s;&s;ing the re|volution. He now carried on this war in Spain, al|mo&s;t
at his own expence; and his friend&s;hip for the Duke Charles was his
&s;tronge&s;t motive to undertake it. He was deformed in per&s;on, but, of a
mind the mo&s;t generous and active that ever in&s;pired an hone&s;t bo&s;om.
His fir&s;t attempt in Spain was to be&s;iege Barcelona, a &s;trong city, with
a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and men, while his own army amounted to but &s;even
thou&s;and. Never was an attempt more bold, or more fortunate. The operations
began by a &s;ud|den attack on fort Monjuice, &s;trongly &s;ituated on an 
<PB N="99" REF="102"> hill, that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by
&s;torm; a &s;hell chanced to fall into the body of the fort, and blew up the
magazine of powder; the garri&s;on of the fort was &s;truck with
con&s;terna|tion, and &s;urrendered without farther re&s;i&s;tance. The town
&s;till remained unconquered; the Engli&s;h general erected batteries again&s;t
it, and, in a few days, the governor capitulated. During the interval of
capitulation, the Germans and Catalonians in the Engli&s;h army had entered the
town, and were plun|dering all before them. The governor thought him|&s;elf
betrayed: he upbraided the treachery of the ge|neral. Peterborough flew among
the plunderers, drove them from their prey, and returned &s;oon after cooly to
fini&s;h the capitulation. The Spaniards were equally amazed at the
genero&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of their own countrymen,
who had led on to the &s;poil.</P>
<P>The conque&s;t of all Valencia &s;ucceeded the tak|ing of this
important place; the enemy, after a de|&s;eated attempt to retake Barcelona,
&s;aw them&s;elves deprived of almo&s;t every hope; the party of Charles was
increa&s;ing every day; he became ma&s;ter of Ara|gon, Carthagena, and Granada;
the road to Madrid, their capital city, lay open before him; the Earl of
Galloway entered it in triumph, and there proclaimed Charles King of Spain,
without farther oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had &s;carce time to rejoice at the&s;e
&s;ucce&s;&s;es of their arms, when their attention was turned to new victories
in Flanders. The Duke of Marlborough had early commenced the campaign, and
brought an army of eighty thou&s;and men into the field, and &s;till expected
reinforcements from Denmark and Pru&s;&s;ia. The court of France wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olved to attack him before this
junction. Ville+roy, who commanded an army con&s;i&s;ting of eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou&s;and men, near Tirlemont, had
orders to en+gage. He accordingly drew up his forces in a &s;tron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="100" REF="103"> camp; his right
was flanked by the river Mehaigne, his left was po&s;ted behind a mar&s;h, and
the village of Ramillies lay in the center. Marlborough, who perceived this
di&s;po&s;ition, drew up his army accord|ingly. He knew that the enemies left
could not pa&s;s the mar&s;h, to attack him, but at a great di&s;advan|tage; he
therefore weakened his troops on that quar|ter, and thundered on the center
with &s;uperior num|bers. They &s;tood but a &s;hort time in the center, and,
at length, gave way on all &s;ides. The hor&s;e abandoned their foot, and were
&s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that almo&s;t all were cut in pieces. Six thou&s;and
men were taken pri&s;oners, and about eight thou&s;and were killed or wounded.
This victory was almo&s;t as &s;ignal as that of Blenheim; Bavaria and Cologne
were the fruits of the one, and all Brabant was gain|ed by the other. The
French troops were di&s;pirit|ed, and the city of Paris overwhelmed with
con|&s;ternation. Lewis XIV, who, in the beginning of his reign, had long been
flattered with conque&s;t, was now humbled to &s;uch a degree as might have
excited the compa&s;&s;ion of his enemies; he intreated for peace, but in vain;
the allies carried all before them; and his very capital dreaded the approach
of the conquerors. What neither his power, his ar|mies, nor his politics, could
effect, a party in England performed; and the di&s;&s;ention between the Whigs
and the Tories &s;aved the dominions of France, that now &s;eemed ready for
ruin.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>QUEEN Anne's councils had hitherto been governed by a Whig
mini&s;try; they &s;till pur|&s;ued the &s;chemes of the late King; and, upon
re|publican principles, &s;trove to diffu&s;e freedom through|out 
<PB N="101" REF="104"> Europe. In a government, where the rea&s;oning of
individuals, retired from power, generally leads tho&s;e who command, the
de&s;igns of the mini&s;try mu&s;t change, as the people happen to alter. The
Queen's per&s;onal virtues, her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, her adulation from the throne,
contributed all to change the di&s;po&s;ition of the nation; they now began to
defend hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, non-re&s;i&s;tance, and divine right; they
were now become Tories, and were ready to con|trovert the de&s;igns of a Whig
mini&s;try, whenever a leader offered to conduct them to the charge.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;contents were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, increa&s;|ed by a
meditated union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. The treaty,
for this pur|po&s;e, was chiefly managed by the mini&s;try; and, al|though it
was fraught with numberle&s;s benefits to either kingdom, yet it rai&s;ed the
murmurs of both. The Engli&s;h expected nothing from the union of &s;o poor a
nation, but a participation of their nece&s;&s;ities; they thought it unju&s;t,
that, while Seotland was granted an eighth part of the legi&s;lature, it yet
&s;hould be taxed but a fortieth part of the &s;upplies. On the other hand, the
Scotch con&s;idered that their independency would be quite de&s;troyed, and the
dignity of their crown betrayed; they dreaded an increa&s;e of taxes, and
&s;eemed not much to e&s;teem the ad|vantages of an increa&s;ed trade. In every
political mea&s;ure there are di&s;advantages on either &s;ide, which may be
&s;ufficient to deter the timid, but which a bold legi&s;lator di&s;regards.
The union, after &s;ome &s;trug|gles, was effected; Scotland was no longer to
have a parliament, but to &s;end &s;ixteen Peers, cho&s;en from the body of
their nobility, and forty-five commoners. The two kingdoms were called by the
common name of Great Britain; and all the &s;ubjects of both were to enjoy a
commun iation of privileges and ad|vantages.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="105"> This mea&s;ure, which &s;trengthened the
vigour of government, by uniting its force, &s;eemed to threaten the enemies of
Great Britain with dangers abroad; but the di&s;contents of the nation at home
prevented the effects of its newly-acquired power. The To|ries, now become the
majority, were di&s;plea&s;ed with the Whig mini&s;try; they looked with
jealou&s;y on the power of the Earl of Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough,
who had long governed the Queen, and lavi&s;hed the trea&s;ures of the nation
on conque&s;ts more glorious than &s;erviceable. To them the people imputed the
burthens under which they now groan|ed, and others which they had rea&s;on to
fear. The lo&s;s of a battle near Almanza in Spain, where the Engli&s;h army
were taken pri&s;oners, under the com|mand of the Earl of Galloway, with &s;ome
other mi&s;|carriages, tended to heighten their di&s;plea&s;ure, and
di&s;pelled the inebriation of former &s;ucce&s;s. The To|ries did not fail to
inculcate and exaggerate the&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;content, while Robert Harley,
after|wards Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, made &s;oon after Lord
Bolingbroke, &s;ecretly fanned the flame.</P>
<P>Harley had lately become a favourite of the Queen; the petulance of
the Duche&s;s of Marlbo|rough, who formerly ruled the Queen, had entirely
alienated the affections of her mi&s;tre&s;s. She now placed them upon one Mrs.
Ma&s;ham, who was en|tirely devoted to Lord Oxford. Oxford was
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon erudition; he was polite and intriguing; he had
in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the royal favour, and determined to &s;ap the
credit of Marl|borough and his adherents. In this attempt he cho&s;e, for his
&s;econd, Bolingbroke, a man of ex|alted powers of thinking, eloquent,
ambitious, and enterpri&s;ing. Bolingbroke was, at fir&s;t, contented to act a
&s;ubordinate character in this meditated oppo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">tion; but, &s;oon perceiving the &s;uperiority of his 
<PB N="103" REF="106"> own talents, from being an inferior, he was re&s;olved
to become Lord Oxford's rival. The Duke of Marlborough &s;oon perceived their
growing power, and re&s;olved to cru&s;h it in the beginning. He re|fu&s;ed to
join in the Privy Council, while Harley was &s;ecretary. Godolphin joined his
influence in this mea&s;ure; and the Queen was obliged to appea&s;e their
re&s;entment, by di&s;charging Harley from his place: Bolingbroke was
re&s;olved to &s;hare his di&s;|grace, and voluntarily relinqui&s;hed his
employments.</P>
<P>This violent mea&s;ure, which &s;eemed, at fir&s;t, fa|vourable to
the Whig mini&s;try, laid the fir&s;t founda|tion of its ruin; the Queen was
intirely di&s;plea&s;ed with the haughty conduct of the Duke; and, from that
moment, he lo&s;t her confidence and affection. Harley was enabled to act now
with le&s;s di&s;gui&s;e, and to take more vigorous mea&s;ures for the
completion of his de&s;igns. In him the Queen repo&s;ed all her tru&s;t, though
he now had no vi&s;ible concern in the admi|ni&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Whig party, in this manner, &s;eemed to tri|umph for &s;ome
time, till an occurrence, in it&s;elf, of no great importance, &s;erved to
&s;hew the &s;pirit of the times. Doctor Sacheverel, a mini&s;ter of narrow
in|tellects and bigotted principles, had publi&s;hed two &s;ermons, in which he
&s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on the illega|lity of re&s;i&s;ting Kings, and enforced
the divine ori|gin of their authority; declaimed again&s;t the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
and exhorted the Church to put on the whole armour of God. There was nothing in
the &s;ermons, either nervous, well written, or clear; they owed all their
celebrity to the complexion of the times, and are at pre&s;ent ju&s;tly
forgotten. Sacheverel was im|peached by the commons, at the bar of the upper
hou&s;e; they &s;eemed re&s;olutely bent upon puni&s;hing him; and a day was
appointed for trying him before the Lords at We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall. Mean while,
the Tories, who, one and all, approved his principles, <PB N="104" REF="107">
were as violent in his defence as the parliament had been in his pro&s;ecution.
The eyes of the kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary tryal; the Queen
her&s;elf was every day pre&s;ent as a private &s;pectator. His tryal la&s;ted
&s;ome days; and va&s;t multitudes attended him each day, as he went to the
hall, &s;houting, and praying for his &s;ucce&s;s. The body of the people
e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e. They de|&s;troyed &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es, and
plundered the dwellings of Di&s;&s;enters; and the Queen her&s;elf could not
but reli&s;h tho&s;e doctrines which contributed to extend her prerogative. The
Lords were divided; they continued undetermined for &s;ome time; but, at
length, after much ob&s;tinate di&s;pute and viru|lent altercation, Sacheverel
was found guilty by a majority of &s;eventeen voices. He was prohibited from
preaching, for the term of three years: his two &s;ermons were ordered to be
burnt by the hands of the common hangman. The lenity of this &s;entence was
con&s;idered, by the Tories, as a victo|ry; and, in fact, their faction took
the lead all the remaining part of this reign.</P>
<P>The King of France, long per&s;ecuted by fortune, and each hour
fearing for his capital, once more pe|titioned for peace. Godolphin and
Marlborough, who had, &s;ince the beginning of the war, enjoyed the double
advantage of extending their glory, and increa&s;ing their fortunes, were
intirely aver&s;e to any negotiation which tended to dimini&s;h both. The
Tories, on the other hand, willing to humble the general, and his partner
Godolphin, were &s;incerely de&s;irous of a peace, as the only mea&s;ure to
attain their ends. A conference was, at length, begun at Gertruydenberg, under
the influence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Zinzendorf, all three entirely
aver&s;e to the treaty. The French mini&s;ters were &s;ubjected to every
&s;pecies of mortification; their conduct nar|rowly watched; their ma&s;ter
in&s;ulted; and their let|ters <PB N="105" REF="108"> opened. They offered to
&s;atisfy every com|plaint that had given ri&s;e to the war; they con&s;ented
to abandon Philip IV, in Spain; to grant the Dutch a large barrier; they even
con&s;ented to grant a &s;up|ply towards dethroning Philip; but even this offer
was treated with contempt, and at length the con|ference was broken off, while
Lewis re&s;olved to ha|zard another campaign.</P>
<P>The de&s;igns of the Dutch, and the Engli&s;h gene|ral, were too
obvious not to be &s;een, and properly explained by their enemies in England.
The writers of the Tory faction, who were men of the fir&s;t rank of literary
merit, di&s;played the avarice of the Duke and the &s;elf-intere&s;ted conduct
of the Dutch; they in&s;i&s;ted, that, while England was exhau&s;ting her
&s;trength in foreign conque&s;ts, &s;he was lo&s;ing her liberty at home; that
her mini&s;ters were not con|tented with &s;haring the plunder of an
impoveri&s;hing &s;tate, but were re&s;olved upon de&s;troying its liberties
al&s;o. To the&s;e complaints were added the real pride of the then prevailing
mini&s;try, and the in&s;olence of the Duche&s;s of Marlborough, who hitherto
had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more real power than the whole privy-coun|cil united.
Mrs. Ma&s;ham, who had fir&s;t been re|commended to the Queen's favour by the
Duche&s;s, now fairly &s;upplanted her patrone&s;s; and, by a &s;teady
attention to plea&s;e the Queen, had gained all that confidence which &s;he had
repo&s;ed in her former confidante. It was too late that the Duche&s;s
per|ceived this alienation of the Queen's favour, and now began to think of
repairing it by demanding an audience of her Maje&s;ty, in order to vindicate
her character from every &s;u&s;picion; but formal expla|nations ever widen the
breach.</P>
<P>Mr. Hill, brother to the new favourite, was ap|pointed by the Queen
to be colonel of a regiment; this the Duke of Marlborough could by no means
approve. He expo&s;tulated with his &s;overeign; he <PB N="106" REF="109">
retired in di&s;gu&s;t; the Queen, by a letter, gave him
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eave to di&s;po&s;e of the
regiment as he &s;hould think proper; but, before it came to his hands, he had
&s;ent a letter to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would permit him to retire from
his employments. This was the conjuncture which the Tories had long wi&s;hed
for, and which the Queen her&s;elf was internally plea&s;ed with. She now
perceived her&s;elf &s;et free from an arbitrary combination, by which &s;he
had been long kept in dependance. The Earl of Godolphin, the Duke's
&s;on-in-law, was dive&s;ted of his office; and the trea&s;ury &s;ubmitted to
Harley, the antagoni&s;t of his ambition. Lord Somers was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
be|ing pre&s;ident of the council, and the Earl of Ro|che&s;ter appointed in
his room. In a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of &s;tate,
except the Duke of Marlborough; he retained his employ|ments for a &s;hort
time, un&s;upported and alone, an object of envy and factious reproach, till at
length be found his cau&s;e irretrievable, and was obliged, after trying
another campaign, to re&s;ign, as the re&s;t of his party had done before.</P>
<P>As war &s;eemed to have been the de&s;ire of the Whig party, &s;o
peace &s;eemed to have been that of the Tories. Through the cour&s;e of
Engli&s;h hi&s;to|ry, France &s;eems to have been the peculiar object of the
hatred of the Whigs, and a continual war with that nation has been their aim.
On the contrary, the Tories have not regarded that nation, with &s;uch
oppo&s;ition of principle; and a peace with France has generally been the
re&s;ult of a Tory admini&s;tration. For &s;ome time therefore, a negotiation
for peace had been carried on between the court of France and the new
mini&s;ters, who had a double aim in this mea|&s;ure; namely, to mortify the
Whigs and the Dutch, and to free their country from a ruinous war which had all
the appearance of becoming habitual to the con&s;titution.</P>

<P>THE conferences for peace were fir&s;t opened at London; and &s;ome
time after the Queen &s;ent the Earl of Strafford as amba&s;&s;ador into
Holland, to communicate the propo&s;als which the French King had made towards
the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the gene|ral tranquility. The &s;pirit of the times
was now changed; Marlborough's aver&s;ion to &s;uch mea&s;ures could now no
longer retard the negotiation; Lord Strafford obliged the Dutch to name
plenipotentiaries, and to receive tho&s;e of France. The treaty began at
Utrecht; but as all the powers concerned in this conference, except France and
England, were aver&s;e to every accommodation, their di&s;putes &s;erved rather
to retard than accelerate a pacification. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try, however,
had fore&s;een and provided again&s;t tho&s;e difficulties. Their great end was
to free the &s;ubjects from a long unprofitable war, a war where conque&s;t
could add nothing to their power, and a defeat might be prejudicial to internal
tranquility. As England had borne the chief burthen of the war, it was but
ju&s;t to expect that it would take the lead in dictating the terms of peace.
There were, however, three per&s;ons of very great intere&s;t and power, who
la|boured, by every art, to protract the negotiation; tho&s;e were the Duke of
Marlborough, Prince Eugene, and Hein&s;ius the Dutch grand pen&s;ionary. Prince
Eugene even came over to London, in order to re|tard the progre&s;s of a peace,
which &s;eemed to interrupt his career of glory; he found at court &s;uch a
recep|tion as was due to his merits and fame; but, at the &s;ame time, &s;uch a
repul&s;e as the propo&s;als he made &s;eemed to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>This negotiation to London failing of effect, the allies practi&s;ed
every artifice to intimidate the Queen, and blacken the character of her
mini&s;ters; to rai&s;e <PB N="108" REF="111"> and continue a dangerous ferment
among the people, to ob&s;truct her councils, and divulge her de&s;igns. Her
mini&s;ters were very &s;en&s;ible of their pre&s;ent dan|gerous &s;ituation;
they perceived her health was daily impairing, and her &s;ucce&s;&s;or
countenanced the oppo|&s;ite faction. In ca&s;e of her death, they had nothing
to expect but pro&s;ecution and ruin, for obeying her commands; their only way
therefore was to give up their pre&s;ent employments, or ha&s;ten the
conclu|&s;ion of a treaty, the utility of which would be the be&s;t argument
with the people in their favour. The peace therefore was ha&s;tened; and this
ha&s;te, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relaxed the mini&s;ters ob&s;tinacy, in
in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;uch terms and advantages as they had a right to demand.
Seeing that nothing was to be expected from the concurrence of the allies, the
courts of Lon|don and Ver&s;ailles re&s;olved to enter into a private treaty,
in which &s;uch terms might be agreed on as would enable both courts to
pre&s;cribe terms to the re&s;t of the contending powers.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of Marlborough having been depo&s;ed from
his office of general, the command of the Engli&s;h army in Flanders was given
to the Duke of Ormond; but, at the &s;ame time, private orders were given him
not to act with vigour again&s;t an enemy, which was upon the point of being
recon|ciled by more mild methods of treatment. The al|lies, thus deprived of
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, &s;till continued their animo&s;ity, and
were re&s;olved to continue the war &s;eparately; they had the utmo&s;t
confidence in Prince Eugene, their general; and, though le&s;&s;ened by the
defection of the Briti&s;h forces, they were &s;till &s;uperior to tho&s;e of
the enemy, which were commanded by Mar&s;hal Villars, a man who &s;eemed to
po&s;&s;e&s;s all the great qualities, and all the &s;oibles of his country, in
a &s;upreme degree; valiant, generous, alert, lively, boa&s;tful, and
avaricious. The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h forces was &s;oon &s;everely felt in
the <PB N="109" REF="112"> allied army. Villars attacked a &s;eparate body of
their troops incamped at Denain, under the command of the Earl of Albemarle.
Their intrenchments were forced, and &s;eventeen battalions either killed or
taken, the Earl him&s;elf, and all the &s;urviving officers, being made
pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Mar&s;hal Villars &s;erved to ha&s;ten
the treaty of Utrecht. The Briti&s;h mini&s;ters at the congre&s;s,
re&s;pon&s;ible at once for their conduct to their Queen, their country, and
all Europe, neglected nothing that might have been &s;erviceable either to the
allies, or that might conduce to the public &s;afety. They fir&s;t &s;tipulated
that Philip V, who had been &s;ettled on the throne of Spain, &s;hould renounce
all right to the crown of France, the union of two &s;uch powerful kingdoms
being thought dangerous to the liberties of the re&s;t of Europe. They
covenanted that the Duke of Berry, his brother, the pre&s;umptive heir to the
crown of France, after the death of the Dauphin, &s;hould al&s;o renounce his
right to the crown of Spain, in ca&s;e he became King of France. The Duke of
Orleans was to make the &s;ame re&s;ignation. To oblige men thus to renounce
their rights might have been inju&s;tice; but, for every good acquired, &s;ome
inconvenience mu&s;t be endured; the&s;e re&s;igna|tions, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
&s;erved to calm the world tempt&s;ted up by long war, and have &s;ince become
the ba&s;is of the law of nations, to which Europe profe&s;&s;es pre&s;ent
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By this treaty the Duke of Savoy had the i&s;land of Sicily, with
the title of King, with Fene&s;trelles, and other places on the continent;
which increa&s;e of his power &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, drawn from the
&s;poils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that barrier granted them, which
they &s;o long &s;ought after; and, if the hou&s;e of Bourbon &s;eemed
&s;tripped of &s;ome dominion, in order to enrich the Duke of Savoy, on the
other hand, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was <PB N="110" REF="113"> taxed to
&s;upply the wants of the Hollanders, who were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
&s;tronge&s;t towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and
intere&s;ts were &s;ecured. They cau&s;ed the fortifica|tions of Dunkirk to be
demoli&s;hed, and its port to be de&s;troyed. Spain gave up all right to
Gibraltar and the i&s;land of Minorca. France re&s;igned Hud|&s;on's-Bay,
Nova-Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Cape-Breton, and the liberty of drying their fi&s;h upon the &s;hore. Among the
articles which were glorious to the Engli&s;h, it may be ob&s;erved, that the
&s;etting free tho&s;e who had been confined in the French pri&s;ons for
profe&s;&s;ing the Prote&s;tant religion, was not the lea&s;t. It was
&s;tipulated, that the Emperor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the king|dom of Naples,
the Duchy of Milan, and the Spa|ni&s;h Netherlands; that the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould have Upper Gueldre; and a time was fixed for the Emperor's
acceding to the&s;e re&s;olutions, for he had hitherto ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the negotia|tions. Thus it appears, that the Engli&s;h
mini&s;try did ju&s;tice to all the world; but their country re|fu&s;ed it to
them; they were branded with all the terms of infamy and reproach by the Whig
party, and accu&s;ed of having given up the privileges and rights which England
had to expect. Each party reviled the other in turn; the kingdom was divided
into oppo&s;ite factions, both &s;o violent in their cau&s;e, that the truth,
which both pretended to e&s;pou&s;e, was attained by neither; both were
virulent, and both wrong. The&s;e commotions, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved
&s;till more to impair the Queen's health. One fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;ucceeded
another; nor did the con&s;olation of her mini&s;try &s;erve to allay her
anxieties; for they now had fallen out among them&s;elves, the council-chamber
being turned into a theatre for the mo&s;t bitter altercations. Oxford
advi&s;ed a reconciliation with the Whigs, who&s;e re&s;entment he now began to
<PB N="111" REF="114"> fear, as the Queen's health appeared to be impaired.
Bolingbroke, on the other hand, affected to &s;et the Whigs at defiance;
profe&s;&s;ed a warm zeal for the church, and mixed flattery with his other
a&s;&s;iduities. Bolingbroke prevailed; Lord Oxford, the trea&s;urer, was
removed from his employment, and retired, me|ditating &s;chemes of revenge, or
new projects for fu|ture re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. His fall was &s;o &s;udden, and
&s;o unexpected, that no plan was e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;up|plying the vacancy
occa&s;ioned by his di&s;grace. All was confu&s;ion at court; and the Queen had
no lon|ger force to &s;upport the burthen; &s;he &s;unk into a &s;tate of
in&s;en&s;ibility, and thus found refuge from anxiety in lethargic &s;lumber.
Every method was contrived to rouze her from this &s;tate, but in vain; her
phy&s;icians di&s;paired of her life. The privy-council a&s;&s;embled upon this
occa&s;ion; the Dukes of Somer&s;et and Argyle, being informed of the
de&s;pe|rate &s;tate in which &s;he lay, entered that a&s;&s;embly without
being &s;ummoned; the members were &s;ur|prized at their appearance; but the
Duke of Shrew&s;|bury thanked them for their readine&s;s to give their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance at &s;uch a critical juncture, and de&s;ired them to take
their places. They now took all the nece&s;|&s;ary precautions for &s;ecuring
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover, &s;ent orders to the Heralds at
Arms, and to a troop of life-guards to be in readi|ne&s;s to mount, in order to
proclaim the Elector of Brun&s;wick King of Great Britain.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth of July the Queen &s;eemed &s;ome|what relieved by
medicines, ro&s;e from her bed, and, about eight, walked a little; when,
ca&s;ting her eyes on the clock that &s;tood in her chamber, &s;he continued to
gaze for &s;ome time. One of the ladies in wait|ing asked her what &s;he &s;aw
there more than u&s;ual? to which the Queen only an&s;wered by turning her eyes
upon her with a dying look. She was &s;oon af|ter &s;eized with a fit of the
apoplexy, from which, <PB N="112" REF="115"> however, &s;he was relieved by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Doctor Mead. In this &s;tate of &s;tupefaction &s;he
continued all night; &s;he gave &s;ome &s;igns of life between twelve and one
next day, but expired the next morning, a little after &s;even o'clock, having
lived forty-nine years five months and &s;ix days; and having reigned more than
twelve years with honour, equity, and applau&s;e. This Prince&s;s was rather
amiable than great, rather plea&s;ing than beautiful; neither her ca|pacity nor
learning were remarkable. Like all tho&s;e of her family, &s;he &s;eemed rather
fitted for the private duties of life than a public &s;tation; a pattern of
con|jugal affection, a good mother, a warm friend, and an indulgent
mi&s;tre&s;s. During her reign none &s;uf|fered on the &s;caffold for
trea&s;on; &s;o that after a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of faulty or cruel Kings,
&s;he &s;hines with particular lu&s;tre. In her ended the line of the
Stew|arts; a family, the misfortunes and mi&s;conducts of which are not to be
paralleled in hi&s;tory; a family who, le&s;s than men them&s;elves, &s;eemed
to expect from their followers more than manhood in their de|fence; a family
demanding rather our pity than a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, who never rewarded their
friends, nor aveng|ed them of their enemies.</P>

<DIV1 N="14" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE nearer we approach to our own times, in this &s;urvey of
Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, the more im|portant every occurrence becomes; our own
intere&s;ts are blended with tho&s;e of the &s;tate; and the accounts of public
welfare are but the tran&s;cript of private happine&s;s. The two parties which
had long divided the kingdom, under the names of Whig and Tory, now &s;eemed to
alter their titles; the Whigs being <PB N="113" REF="116"> &s;tyled
Hanoverians, and the Tories branded with the appellation of Jacobites. The
former, de&s;ired to be governed by a King, who was a Prote&s;tant, though a
foreigner; the latter, by a Monarch of their own country, though a Papi&s;t. Of
two inconveniencies, however, that &s;eemed the lea&s;t, where religion
&s;eemed to be in no danger; and the Hanoverians prevailed.</P>
<P>The Jacobites had been long flattered with the hopes of &s;eeing the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion altered by the Earl of Oxford; but by the premature death of
the Queen, all their expectations at once were bla&s;ted; the dili|gence and
activity of the privy-council, in which the Hanoverian intere&s;t prevailed,
completed their confu&s;ion, and they now found them&s;elves without any leader
to give con&s;i&s;tency to their de&s;igns, and force to their councils. Upon
recollection they &s;aw nothing &s;o eligible as &s;ilence and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; they hoped much from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, and
&s;till more from the vigour of the pretender.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. George I, &s;on of
Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, fir&s;t Elector of Brun&s;wick, and Sophia, grand-daughter
to James I, a&s;cended the Briti&s;h throne. His mature age, being now
fifty-four years old; his &s;agacity and experience, his nu|merous alliances,
the general peace of Europe; all contributed to his &s;upport, and promi&s;ed a
peaceable and happy reign. His virtues, though not &s;hining, were &s;olid; he
was of a very different di&s;po&s;ition from the Stewart family, whom he
&s;ucceeded; they were known to a proverb for leaving their friends in
di&s;tre&s;s; George, on the contrary, &s;oon after his ar|rival in England,
u&s;ed to &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My maxim is never to abandon my friends; to do
ju&s;tice to all the world; and to fear no man.</HI></Q> To the&s;e
qualifications he joined great application to bu&s;ine&s;s; but generally
&s;tudied more the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;ubjects he had left behind, than
of the&s;e he came to govern.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="117"> The King fir&s;t landed at Greenwich, where
he was received by the Duke of Northumberland, and the Lords of the regency.
From the landing-place he walked to his hou&s;e in the Park, accompanied by a
great number of the nobility, and other per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who had
the honour to ki&s;s his hand, as they approached. When he retired to his
bed-chamber, he &s;ent for tho&s;e of the nobility who had di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their zeal for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the Duke of Ormond,
the Lord Chancellor, and Lord Trevor, were not of the num|ber; Lord Oxford too,
the next morning, was re|ceived with marks of di&s;approbation; and none but
the Whig party were admitted into any &s;hare of con|fidence. The King of a
faction is but the &s;overeign of half his &s;ubjects; of this, however, the
Monarch I &s;peak of did not &s;eem &s;en&s;ible; it was his misfor|tune, as
well as that of the nation, that he was hemmed round by men who &s;oured him
with all their intere&s;ts and prejudices; none now but the violent in faction
were admitted into employment; and the Whigs, while they pretended to &s;ecure
for him the crown, were, with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, abridging the
prerogative. An in&s;tantaneous and to|tal change was effected in all offices
of honour and advantage. The Whigs governed the &s;enate, and the court
di&s;po&s;ed of all places at plea&s;ure; whom they would they oppre&s;&s;ed;
bound the lower orders of people with new and &s;evere laws; and this they
called liberty.</P>
<P>The&s;e partialities, and this oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;oon rai&s;ed
di&s;contents throughout the kingdom. The clamour of the church's being in
danger was revived; jea|lou&s;ies were received, and dangerous tumults rai&s;ed
in every part of the country. The party cry was, Down with the Whigs;
Sacheveral for ever. Dur|ing the&s;e commotions in the Pretender's favour, this
<PB N="115" REF="118"> Prince him&s;elf continued only a calm &s;pectator on
the continent, now and then &s;ending over his emi&s;|&s;aries to inflame the
di&s;turbances, to di&s;per&s;e his in|effectual manife&s;toes, and to delude
the unwary. Copies of a printed addre&s;s were &s;ent to the Dukes of
Shrew&s;bury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the fir&s;t
di&s;tinction, vindicating the Pretender's right to the crown, and complaining
of the inju&s;tice that was done him by receiving a foreigner. Yet, for all
this, he &s;till continued to profe&s;s the true&s;t regard for the Catholic
religion; and, in&s;tead of concealing his &s;entiments on that head, gloried
in his principles. It was the being a Papi&s;t which had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
his father of the throne; and &s;urely the &s;on could never hope to gain a
crown by the very methods in which it was lo&s;t; but an infatuation &s;eemed
for ever to attend all the family.</P>
<P>However odious, at that time, the Popi&s;h &s;uper|&s;titions were
to the people in general, yet the opinions of the Di&s;&s;enters &s;eemed
&s;till more di&s;plea&s;ing. Re|ligion was mingled with all political
di&s;putes. The High-church party complained, that, under a Whig
admini&s;tration, impiety and here&s;y daily gained ground; that the prelates
were at once negligent of religious concerns, and warm in pur&s;uit of
tem|poral ble&s;&s;ings. A book written by Doctor Samuel Clarke, in favour of
Sociniani&s;m, was &s;trictly re|prehended; the di&s;putes among the Churchmen
ro&s;e to &s;uch a height that the mini&s;try was obliged to in|terpo&s;e; and
the clergy received orders for fini&s;hing &s;uch-like debates, and from
intermeddling in affairs of &s;tate. Nothing, however, can be more impolitic in
a &s;tate, than to prohibit the clergy from di&s;puting with each other; by
this means they become more animated in the cau&s;e of religion; and which ever
&s;ide they defend, they become wi&s;er and better, as they carry on the
cau&s;e. To &s;ilence their di&s;putes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s to lead them into negligence; if
religion be not <PB N="116" REF="119"> kept up by oppo&s;ition, it falls to the
ground, no longer becomes an object of public concern. Go|vernment, I &s;ay
again, &s;hould never &s;ilence di&s;pute, and &s;hould never &s;ide with
either di&s;putant.</P>
<P>A new parliament was now called, in which the Whigs had by far the
majority; all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to the
Tories, and led on by the King him&s;elf, who made no &s;ecret of his
di&s;|plea&s;ure. Upon their fir&s;t meeting he informed them, that the
branches of the revenue granted for the &s;up|port of civil government, were
not &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e; he apprized them of the machinations of
the Pretender, and intimated that he expected their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in
puni&s;hing &s;uch as had endeavoured to deprive him of that ble&s;&s;ing which
he mo&s;t valued, the affection of his people. As the hou&s;es were then
di&s;po&s;ed, this &s;erved to give them the alarm; and they out-went even the
mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the mo&s;t vindictive mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Their re&s;entment began with arraigning Lord Bo|lingbroke of high
trea&s;on, and other high crimes and mi&s;demeanors. To this it was objected by
one of the members of the hou&s;e of commons, that nothing in the allegations
laid to his charge amounted to high trea&s;on. To this there was no reply
given; but, Lord Coning&s;by &s;tanding up, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The chairman,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>has impeached
the hand, but I impeach the head; he has impeached the &s;cholar, and I the
ma&s;ter. I impeach Robert Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer, of high trea&s;on
and other crimes and mi&s;demeanors.</HI></Q> When there|fore this nobleman
appeared the next day in the hou&s;e of Lords, he was avoided, by his brother
Peers, as infectious; he, who&s;e favour had been but a little before &s;o
earne&s;tly &s;ought after, was now rejected and contemned. When the articles
were read again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of Peers, &s;ome debates aro&s;e as to
the nature of his indictment, which, however, were carried by his
adver&s;aries, and the articles of im|peachment <PB N="117" REF="120"> approved
by the hou&s;e; he was therefore again impeached at the bar of the hou&s;e of
Lords; and a motion was made that he might lo&s;e his &s;eat, and be committed
to clo&s;e cu&s;tody. The Earl now &s;eeing a furious &s;pirit of faction
rai&s;ed again&s;t him, and aiming at his head, was not wanting to him&s;elf,
upon this emergency, but &s;poke to the following purpo&s;e: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I am accu&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>for having
made a peace; a peace, which, bad as it is now repre&s;ented, has been approved
by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parliaments. For my own part, I always acted by the
immediate directions and commands of the Queen my mi&s;tre&s;s, and never
offended again&s;t any known law. I am ju&s;tified in my own con&s;cience, and
unconcerned for the life of an in&s;ignificant old man. But I cannot, without
the highe&s;t ingratitude, remain uncon|cerned for the be&s;t of Queens;
obligation binds me to vin|dicate her memory. My Lords, if mini&s;ters of
&s;tate, act|ing by the immediate commands of their Sovereign, are afterwards
to be made accountable for their proceedings, it may, one day or other, be the
ca&s;e of all the members of this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly. I do not doubt
therefore, that, out of regard to your&s;elves, your Lord&s;hips will give me
an equi|table hearing; and I hope, that in the pro&s;ecution of this inquiry it
will appear, that I have merited, not only the indulgence, but al&s;o the
favour of this government. My Lords, I am now to take my leave of your
Lord&s;hips, and of this honourable hou&s;e, perhaps, for ever! I &s;hall lay
down my life with plea&s;ure, in a cau&s;e favoured by my late dear royal
mi&s;tre&s;s. And, when I con&s;ider that I am to be judged by the ju&s;tice,
honour, and virtue of my Peers, I &s;hall acquie&s;ce, and retire with great
content. And, my Lords, God's will be done.</HI></Q> On his return from the
hou&s;e of Lords to his own hou&s;e, where he was, for that night, permitted to
go, he was followed by a great multitude of people, crying out, High-church
Ormond and Oxford for ever. Next day he was brought to the bar, where he
received a copy of his articles, and was allowed a month to prepare his
an|&s;wer. <PB N="118" REF="121"> Though Doctor Mead declared, that if the Earl
&s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower, his life would be in danger, it was carried,
that he &s;hould be &s;ent there, whither he was attended by a prodigious
con|cour&s;e of people, who did not &s;cruple to exclaim again&s;t his
pro&s;ecutors. Tumults grew more fre|quent; and this only &s;erved to
increa&s;e the &s;everity of the legi&s;lature. An act was made, decreeing,
that if any per&s;ons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully a&s;&s;embled,
&s;hould continue together one hour, after being required to di&s;per&s;e by a
Ju&s;tice of Peace, or other officer, and heard the proclamation again&s;t
riots read in public, they &s;hould be deemed guilty of fe|lony, without
benefit of the clergy. An act of this kind carries its own comment with it;
legi&s;lators &s;hould ever be aver&s;e to enacting &s;uch laws as leave the
greate&s;t room for abu&s;e.</P>
<P>A committee was now appointed to draw up ar|ticles of impeachment,
and prepare evidence again&s;t him and the other impeached Lords; he was
con|fined in the Tower, and there remained for two years; during which time,
the kingdom was in a continual ferment, &s;everal other Lords, who had broke
out into actual rebellion, and were taken in arms, being executed for
trea&s;on; the mini&s;try &s;eemed weary of executions; and he, with his
u&s;ual fore|&s;ight, pre&s;ented, upon this occa&s;ion, a petition for coming
to his tryal. A day was therefore a&s;&s;igned him. The commons appointed a
committee to en|quire into the &s;tate of the Earl's impeachment, and demanded
a longer time to prepare for the tryal. The truth is, they had now began to
relax in their former a&s;perity; and the intoxication of party was not quite
&s;o &s;trong now as when he had been fir&s;t committed. At the appointed time
the Peers repair|ed to the court in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where Lord Cowper
pre&s;ided as Lord Steward. The commons were a&s;&s;embled; and the King and
royal family a&s;|&s;i&s;ted <PB N="119" REF="122"> at the &s;olemnity. The
pri&s;oner was brought from the Tower, and his articles of impeachment read,
with his an&s;wers and the replies of the com|mons. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, one of
the agents for the commons, &s;tanding up to enforce the fir&s;t article of his
Lord&s;hip's accu&s;ation, one of the Lords adjourn|ing the hou&s;e,
ob&s;erved, that much time would be con&s;umed in going through all the
articles of the im|peachment; that nothing more remained than for the commons
to make good the two articles of high trea&s;on contained in his charge; and
that this would at once determine the tryal. His advice was agreed to by the
Lords; but the commons delivered a paper containing their rea&s;ons for
a&s;&s;erting it as their un|doubted right to carry on the impeachment in the
manner they thought mo&s;t conducive to their aim. On the other hand, the
hou&s;e of Lords in&s;i&s;ted on their former re&s;olution, con&s;idering it as
the privi|lege of every judge to hear each cau&s;e in the man|ner he thinks
mo&s;t fitting. The di&s;pute grew &s;till more violent; a me&s;&s;age was at
length &s;ent to the commons, intimating that the Lords intended to pro|ceed
immediately to the Earl of Oxford's tryal; and, &s;oon after repairing to the
Hall of Ju&s;tice, they took their places. The commons, however, did not think
fit to appear; and the Earl, having waited a quarter of an hour at the bar, was
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for want of ac|cu&s;ers. To this di&s;pute, perhaps, he owed
his &s;afe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y, though it is

and rule the nation with rigour and partiality. <PB N="120" REF="123"> In
Scotland the di&s;content broke forth, at length, into the flames of rebellion.
The Earl of Mar, a&s;|&s;embling three hundred of his own va&s;&s;als, in the
Highlands of Scotland, proclaimed the Pretender at Ca&s;tletown, and &s;et up
his &s;tandard at Brae Mar, on the &s;ixth day of September, then a&s;&s;uming
the title of Lieutenant-general of the Pretender's forces; he ex|horted the
people to take arms in defence of their lawful Sovereign. But the&s;e
preparations were weak and ill-conducted; all the de&s;igns of the rebels
be|trayed to the government, the beginning of every re|volt repre&s;&s;ed, the
we&s;tern counties prevented from ri&s;ing, and the mo&s;t prudent precautions
taken to keep all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons in cu&s;tody, or in awe. The Earl of
Derwentwater, and Mr. Fo&s;ter, took the field near the borders of Scotland;
and, being joined by &s;ome gentlemen, proclaimed the Pretender. Their fir&s;t
attempt was to &s;eize upon Newca&s;tle, in which they had many friends; but
they found the gates &s;hut upon them, and were obliged to retire to Hexam;
while General Carpenter, having a&s;&s;embled a body of dragoons, re&s;olved to
attack them before their numbers were increa&s;ed. The rebels had two methods
of acting with &s;ucce&s;s; either marching immediately into the we&s;tern
parts of Scotland, and there joining General Gordon, who commanded a &s;trong
body of Highlanders; or of cro&s;&s;ing the Tweed, and attacking General
Carpenter, who&s;e forces did not exceed nine hundred men. From their u&s;ual
infa|tuation neither of the&s;e &s;chemes were put into exe|cution; for, taking
the route another way, they left General Carpenter on one &s;ide, and
re&s;olved to pe|netrate into England by the we&s;tern border. They accordingly
advanced without either fore&s;ight or de|&s;ign, as far as Pre&s;ton, where
they fir&s;t heard the news that General Wills was marching at the head of
&s;ix regiments of hor&s;e, and a battalion of foot, to attack them. They now
therefore began to rai&s;e <PB N="121" REF="124"> barricadoes, and to put the
place in a po&s;ture of de|fence, repul&s;ing at fir&s;t the attack of the
King's army with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. Next day, however, General Wills was
reinforced by the troops under Carpenter, and the rebels were inve&s;ted on all
&s;ides. Fo&s;ter, their General, &s;ent Colonel Oxburgh with a trum|pet to the
Engli&s;h commander, to propo&s;e a capitu|lation. This, however, General Wills
refu&s;ed, al|ledging that he would not treat with rebels; and that all they
could expect was, to be &s;pared from imme|diate &s;laughter. The&s;e were hard
terms; but they were then obliged to &s;ubmit. They accordingly laid down their
arms, and were put under a &s;trong guard. The leaders were &s;ecured, and led
through London pinioned, and bound together, while the common men were confined
at Che&s;ter and Liverpool.</P>
<P>While the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances attended the rebels in
England, the Earl of Mar's forces, in the mean time, increa&s;ed to the number
of ten thou&s;and men, and he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole county
of Fife. Again&s;t him the Duke of Argyle &s;et out for Scotland, as commander
in chief of the forces in North Britain; and, a&s;&s;embling &s;ome troops in
Lothian, returned to Stirling with all po&s;&s;ible ex|pedition. The Earl of
Mar, being informed of this, at fir&s;t retreated; but being joined &s;oon
after by &s;ome Clans under the Earl of Seaforth, and others by General Gordon,
who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, he re&s;olved to
march forward to|wards England. The Duke of Argyle, apprized of his intention,
and being joined by &s;ome regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined to
give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain, though his forces were by no
means &s;o numerous as tho&s;e of the rebel army. In the morning therefore of
the &s;ame day on which the Pre&s;ton rebels had &s;urrendered, he drew up his
forces, which did not exceed three thou&s;and five hundred men, but found
him&s;elf greatly out|flanked <PB N="122" REF="125"> by the enemy. The Duke
therefore perceiv|ing the enemy making attempts to &s;urround him, was obliged
to alter his di&s;po&s;ition; which, on account of the &s;carcity of general
officers, was not done &s;o expeditiou&s;ly as to be all formed before the
rebels be|gun the attack. The left wing therefore of the Duke's army fell in
with the center of the enemy's, and &s;upported the fir&s;t charge without
&s;hrinking. This wing even &s;eemed, for a &s;hort time, victorious, as they
killed the chief leader of part of the rebel army. But Glengary, who was
&s;econd in command, undertook to in&s;pire his intimidated forces; and, waving
his bonnet, cried out &s;everal times, Revenge. This animated his men to &s;uch
a degree, that they followed him clo&s;e to the muzzles of the mu&s;kets,
pu&s;hed a&s;ide the bayonets with their targets, and with their broad-&s;words
did great execution. A total route of that wing of the royal army en&s;ued, and
General Witham, their commander, flying full &s;peed to Stir|ling, gave out,
that all was lo&s;t. In the mean time the Duke of Argyle, who commanded in
per&s;on on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, and drove them before
him for two miles, though they often faced about, and attempted to rally. The
Duke having thus entirely broke their left, and pu&s;hed them over the river
Allen, returned to the field, where they found that part of the rebel army
which had been victorious; but, in&s;tead of renewing the engage|ment, both
armies continued to gaze at each other, neither caring to engage; till towards
evening both &s;ides drew off, each boa&s;ting of victory. Which ever might
claim the triumph, it mu&s;t be owned, that all the honour, and all the
advantages of the day, belonged only to the Duke of Argyle. It was &s;ufficient
for him to have interrupted the enemies progre&s;s; and delay was to them a
defeat. The Earl of Mar therefore &s;oon found his di&s;appoint|ments, and
lo&s;&s;es increa&s;e. The ca&s;tle of Inverne&s;s, <PB N="123" REF="126"> of
which he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was delivered up to the King by Lord Lovat,
who had hitherto appeared in the intere&s;t of the Pretender. The Marquis of
Tullibardine left the Earl to defend his own coun|try; and many of the Clans
&s;eeing no likelihood of coming &s;oon to a &s;econd engagement, returned
home. An irregular army being much ea&s;ier led to battle, than induced to bear
the fatigues of a campaign.</P>
<P>The pretender might now be convinced of the va|nity of his
expectations, in imagining that the whole country would ri&s;e up in his
cau&s;e; his affairs now were actually de&s;perate; yet, with the u&s;ual
infatu|ation of the family, he re&s;olved to hazard his per&s;on among his
friends in Scotland, at a time when &s;uch a mea&s;ure was totally u&s;ele&s;s.
Pa&s;&s;ing therefore through France in di&s;gui&s;e, and embarking in a
&s;mall ve&s;&s;el at Dunkirk, he arrived, on the twenty-&s;econd day of
December, on the coa&s;ts of Scotland, with only &s;ix gentlemen in his
retinue. Upon his arrival in Aberdeen, he was &s;olemnly proclaimed, and &s;oon
after made his public entry into Dundee; and, in two days more, came to Scoon,
where he intended to have the ceremony of his coronation performed. He ordered
thank&s;givings for his &s;afe arrival, injoined the mini&s;ters to pray for
him in the churches; and, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of power, went
through all the ceremonies of royalty, which were, at &s;uch a juncture,
perfectly ridiculous. After this unimpor|tant parade, he re&s;olved to abandon
the enterprize with the &s;ame levity with which it had been undertaken, and
embarked again for France, together with the Earl of Mar, and &s;ome others, in
a &s;mall &s;hip that lay in the harbour of Montro&s;s; and, in five days,
arrived at Gravelin. General Gordon, who was left com|mander in chief of the
forces, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Earl-mar&s;hal, proceeded with them to
Aberdeen, where he &s;ecured three ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail northward, which took
on board the per&s;ons who intended to <PB N="124" REF="127"> make their
e&s;cape to the continent. In this manner the rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed;
but the fury of the victors did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to abate with
&s;uc|ce&s;s. The law was now put in force, with all its terrors; and the
pri&s;ons of London were crowded with tho&s;e deluded wretches whom the
mini&s;try &s;hew|ed no di&s;po&s;ition to &s;pare. The commons, in their
addre&s;s to the crown, declared they would pro&s;ecute in the mo&s;t vigorous
manner the authors of the re|bellion; and their re&s;olutions were as &s;peedy
as their mea&s;ures were vindictive. The Earls Der|wentwater, Nith&s;dale,
Carnwath, and Wintown; the Lords Widrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn, were
impeached. The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act was &s;u&s;pended; and the rebel
Lords, upon pleading guilty, received &s;entence of death. Nothing could
&s;often the Privy Council; the hou&s;e of Lords even pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s
to the throne for mercy, but without effect. Orders were di&s;patched for
executing the Earls of Derwentwater and Nith&s;dale, and the vi&s;count
Ken|muir, immediately; the others were re&s;pited for three weeks longer.
Nith&s;dale, however, e&s;caped in wo|man's cloaths, which were brought him by
his mo|ther, the night before his intended execution. Der|wentwater and Kenmuir
were brought to the &s;caf|fold on Tower-hill, at the hour appointed. Both
underwent their &s;entence with calmne&s;s and intrepi|dity, pitied by all,
&s;eemingly le&s;s moved them&s;elves than the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>An act of parliament was al&s;o made for trying the private
pri&s;oners in London, and not in Lanca&s;hire, where they were taken in arms;
which proceeding was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an alteration of the ancient
con&s;titution of the kingdom; when Fo&s;ter, Mackin|to&s;h, and &s;everal
others were found guilty. Fo&s;ter, however, e&s;caped from Newgate, and
reached the continent in &s;afety; and &s;ome time after al&s;o Mack|into&s;h,
with &s;ome others, forced their way, having <PB N="125" REF="128"> ma&s;tered
the keeper and turnkey, and di&s;armed the centinel. Four or five were hanged,
drawn, and quartered; among whom was William Paul, a cler|gyman, who
profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a true and &s;incere member of the Church of England;
but not of that &s;chi&s;matical church who&s;e Bi&s;hops had abandoned their
King. Such was the end of a rebellion, pro|bably fir&s;t in&s;pired by the
rigour of the new Whig mini&s;try and parliament. In running through the
vici&s;&s;itudes of human tran&s;actions, we too often find both &s;ides
culpable; and &s;o it was in this ca&s;e. The royal party acted under the
influences of partiality, rigour, and prejudice, gratified private animo&s;ity
under the ma&s;k of public ju&s;tice; and, in their pretended love of
ju&s;tice, forgot humanity. On the other hand, the pretender's party aimed not
only at &s;ubverting the government, but the religion of the kingdom; bred a
Papi&s;t him&s;elf, he confided only in coun&s;ellors of his own
per&s;ua&s;ion; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who ad|hered to his cau&s;e were men of
indifferent morals, or bigotted principles. Clemency, however, in the
government, at that time, would probably have ex|tingui&s;hed all the factious
&s;pirit which has hitherto di&s;turbed the peace of this country; for it has
ever been the character of the Engli&s;h, that they are more ea&s;ily led than
driven to loyalty.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>IN a government, &s;o very complicated as that of England, it mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily change from it&s;elf, in a revolution of even a few years, as
&s;ome of its weaker branches acquire &s;trength, or its &s;tronger de|cline.
At this period, the rich and noble &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater &s;hare
of power than they had done for &s;ome ages preceding; the hou&s;e of commons
be|came <PB N="126" REF="129"> each day a &s;tronger body, at once more
inde|pendent on the crown and the people. It was now &s;een that the rich could
at any time buy their elec|tion; and that while their laws governed the poor,
they might be enabled to govern the law. The re|bellion was now extingui&s;hed;
and the &s;everities which ju&s;tice had inflicted, excited the di&s;content of
many, who&s;e humane pa&s;&s;ions were awakened as their fears began to
&s;ub&s;ide. This &s;erved as a pre|text for continuing the parliament, and
repealing the act by which they were to be di&s;&s;olved at the expiration of
every third year. An act of this na|ture, by which a parliament thus extended
their own power, was thought, by many, the ready means of undermining the
con&s;titution; for if they could with impunity extend their continuance for
&s;even years, which was the time propo&s;ed, they could al&s;o for life
continue their power; but this, it was ob&s;erved, was utterly incompatible
with the &s;pirit of legi&s;la|tion. The bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed both
hou&s;es; all objections to it were con&s;idered as di&s;affection; and, in a
&s;hort time, it received the royal &s;anction. The people might murmur at this
encroachment; but it was now too late for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic concerns being thus adju&s;ted, the King began to turn
his thoughts to his Hanoverian dominions, and determined upon a voyage to the
continent. Nor was he without his fears for his dominions there, as Charles
XII, of Sweden, pro|fe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure at his having
entered into a confederacy again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence. Having therefore
pa&s;&s;ed through Holland to Han|over, in order to &s;ecure his German
territories, he entered into a treaty with the Dutch and the Regent of France,
by which they promi&s;ed mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, in ca&s;e of
inva&s;ion; but the death of the Swedi&s;h Monarch, who was killed by a
cannon|ball at the &s;iege of Frederick&s;tadt, &s;oon put an 
<PB N="127" REF="130"> end to his di&s;quietudes from that quarter. However,
his Maje&s;ty, to &s;ecure him&s;elf as far as alliances could add to his
&s;afety, entered into various negotiations with the different powers of
Europe; &s;ome were brought to accede by money, others by promi&s;es. Treaties
of this kind &s;eldom give any real &s;ecurity; they may be con&s;idered as
mere political playthings; they amu&s;e for a while, and then are thrown
neglect|ed by, never more to be heard of, as nothing but its own internal
&s;trength or &s;ituation can guard a coun|try from in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Among other treaties concluded with &s;uch inten|tions, was that
called the <HI>Quadruple Alliance.</HI> It was agreed upon between the Emperor,
France, England, and Holland, that the Emperor &s;hould renounce all
preten&s;ions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the
Duke of Savoy. That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Duchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma,
and Placentia, &s;hould be &s;ettled on the Queen of Spain's elde&s;t &s;on, in
ca&s;e the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue.
This treaty was by no means favourable to the intere&s;ts of England, as it
inter|rupted the commerce with Spain; and, as it de|&s;troyed the balance of
power in Italy, by throw|ing too much into the hands of Au&s;tria. How|ever,
England &s;itted out a &s;trong &s;quadron in or|der to bring Spain to terms,
if that kingdom &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon its rights in Italy. The war between
the Emperor and King of Spain was actually begun in that country; and the
mediation of the King of England was rejected, as partial and unju&s;t. It was
therefore re&s;olved by the court of London to &s;up|port its negotiations with
the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons; namely, tho&s;e of war. Sir George Byng &s;ailed
to Naples with twenty-two &s;hips of the line, where he was received as a
deliverer, that city having been under the utmo&s;t terrors of an inva&s;ion
from Spain. <PB N="128" REF="131"> Here the Engli&s;h admiral received
intelligence, that the Spani&s;h army, amounting to thirty thou&s;and men, had
landed in Sicily; wherefore he immediately de|termined to &s;ail thither, fully
re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the Spani&s;h fleet. Upon doubling Cape Faro, he
per|ceived two &s;mall Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and pur&s;uing them clo&s;ely
they led him to their main fleet, which, be|fore noon, he perceived in line of
battle, amounting, in all, to twenty-&s;even &s;ail. At &s;ight of the
Engli&s;h fleet, the Spani&s;h fleet, though &s;uperior in numbers, attempted
to &s;ail away, as the Engli&s;h had, for &s;ome time, acquired &s;uch
expertne&s;s in naval affairs, that no other nation would venture to face them,
ex|cept with manife&s;t advantage on their &s;ide. The Spaniards &s;eemed
di&s;tracted in their councils, and acted with extreme confu&s;ion; they made a
running fight; but notwith&s;tanding what they could do, all but three were
taken. The admiral, during this en|gagement, acted with equal prudence and
re&s;olution; and the King wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his
conduct. This victory nece&s;&s;arily pro|duced the re&s;entment and complaints
of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters at all the courts of Europe, which induced England
to declare war with Spain; and the Regent of France joined England in a
&s;imilar declaration. The Duke of Ormond now, once more, hoped, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cardinal Alberoni, the Spani&s;h mini|&s;ter, to re&s;tore
the pretender in England. He accord|ingly &s;et &s;ail with &s;ome troops, and
proceeded as far as Cape Fini&s;terre, where his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed, and
di&s;abled by a violent &s;torm, which entirely fru&s;trated the armament; and,
from this time, the pretender &s;eemed to lo&s;e all hopes of being received in
Eng|land. This blow of fortune, together with the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the
Spani&s;h arms in Sicily and el&s;ewhere, once more induced them to wi&s;h for
peace; and the King of Spain was at la&s;t contented to &s;ign the qua|druple
alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132"> King George having thus, with equal vigour
and deliberation, &s;urmounted all the ob&s;tacles he met with in his way to
the throne, and u&s;ed every precaution that &s;agacity could &s;ugge&s;t, for
&s;ecuring him&s;elf in it, again returned to England, where the addre&s;&s;es
from both hou&s;es were as loyal as he could expect. From addre&s;&s;ing they
turned to an object of the greate&s;t im|portance; namely, that of &s;ecuring
the dependency of the Iri&s;h parliament upon that of Great Britain. Maurice
Anne&s;ly had appealed to the hou&s;e of Peers in England, from a decree of the
hou&s;e of Peers in Ireland; which was rever&s;ed. The Briti&s;h Peers ordered
the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland, to put Mr. Anne&s;ly in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands he had lo&s;t by the decree in that kingdom.
The Barons obeyed this order, and the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of Peers pa&s;&s;ed a
vote again&s;t them, as having attempted to dimini&s;h the ju&s;t privileges of
the parliament of Ireland; and, at the &s;ame time, ordered the Barons to be
taken under the cu&s;tody of the Black Rod. On the other hand, the hou&s;e of
Lords in England re&s;olved, that the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland had
acted with courage and fidelity; and addre&s;&s;ed the King to &s;ignify his
approbation of their conduct, by &s;ome marks of his favour. To complete their
intention, a bill was prepared, by which the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of Lords was
deprived of all rights of final juri&s;diction. This was oppo&s;ed in both
hou&s;es. In the lower hou&s;e Mr. Pitt a&s;&s;erted, that it would only
increa&s;e the power of the Engli&s;h Peers, who already had too much. Mr.
Hungerford demon&s;trated that the Iri&s;h Lords had always exerted their power
of finally deciding cau&s;es. The Duke of Leeds produced fifteen rea&s;ons
again&s;t the bill; but, notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition, it was carried by
a great majority, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The kingdom of Ireland was
not, at that time, &s;o well acquainted with the nature of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">iberty, and its own
con&s;titution, as it is at pre&s;ent. <PB N="130" REF="133"> Their hou&s;e of
Lords might then con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of men bred up in luxury and ignorance;
neither &s;pi|rited enough to make oppo&s;ition, nor &s;kilful enough to
conduct it.</P>
<P>But this blow, which the Iri&s;h felt &s;everely, was not &s;o great
as that which England now began to &s;uffer from that &s;pirit of avarice and
chicanery which had infected almo&s;t all ranks of people. In the year 1720,
John Law, a Scotchman, had erected a com|pany in France under the name of the
Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; which, at fir&s;t, promi&s;ed the deluded people immen&s;e
wealth, but too &s;oon appeared an impo&s;ture, and left the greate&s;t part of
that nation in ruin and di&s;tre&s;s. The year following the people of England
were de|ceived by ju&s;t &s;uch another project, which is remem|bered by all by
the name of the South-Sea &s;cheme; and, to this day, felt by thou&s;ands. To
explain this as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, it is to be ob&s;erved, that ever
&s;ince the revolution, the government, not hav|ing &s;ufficient &s;upplies
granted by parliament; or, what was granted requiring time to be collected,
they were obliged to borrow money from &s;everal different companies of
merchants; and, among the re&s;t, from that company which traded to the
South-Sea. In the year 1716, they were indebted to this company about nine
millions and an half of money, for which they granted annually at the rate of
&s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> in|tere&s;t. As this company was not the only one, to
which the government was debtor, and paid &s;uch large intere&s;t yearly, Sir
Robert Walpole conceived a de&s;ign of le&s;&s;ening the&s;e national debts, by
giving the &s;everal companies an alternative, either of ac|cepting a lower
intere&s;t; namely, five <HI>per cent.</HI> for their money, or of being paid
the principal. The different companies cho&s;e rather to accept of the
dimini&s;hed intere&s;t than their capital; and the South-Sea company
accordingly having made up their debt to the government ten millions, in&s;tead
of &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds which they u&s;ually received 
<PB N="131" REF="134"> as intere&s;t, were &s;atisfied with five hundred
thou|&s;and. In the &s;ame manner the governors and com|pany of the Bank, and
other companies, were con|tented to receive a dimini&s;hed annuity for their
&s;e|veral loans, all which greatly le&s;&s;ened the debts of the nation. It
was in this &s;ituation of things that Sir John Blount, who had been bred a
&s;crivener, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the cunning and plau&s;ibility
re|qui&s;ite for &s;uch an undertaking, propo&s;ed to the mi|ni&s;try, in the
name of the South-Sea company, to le&s;&s;en the national debt &s;till further,
by permitting the South-Sea company to buy up all the debts of the different
companies, and thus to become the principal creditor of the &s;tate. The terms
offered the govern|ment were extremely advantageous. The South-Sea company was
to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors,
who were creditors to the government, upon whatever terms they could agree on;
and, for the intere&s;t of this money, which they had thus redeemed, and taken
into their own hands, they &s;hould be allowed for &s;ix years five <HI>per
cent.</HI> and then the intere&s;t &s;hould be reduced to four <HI>per
cent.</HI> and be redeemable by par|liament. For the&s;e purpo&s;es a bill
pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es; and as the directors of the South-Sea company could
not of them&s;elves alone be &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of money
&s;ufficient to buy up the&s;e debts of the go|vernment, they were impowered to
rai&s;e it by open|ing a &s;ub&s;cription, and granting annuities to &s;uch
proprietors as &s;hould think proper to exchange their creditors; namely, the
Crown for the South-Sea company, with the advantages that might be made by
their indu&s;try. The &s;uperior advantages with which the proprietors were
flattered, by thus ex|changing their property in the funds for South-Sea
&s;tock were a chimerical pro&s;pect of having their money
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urned to great advantage, by a
commerce to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">outhern parts of
America, where it was reported, <PB N="132" REF="135"> that the Engli&s;h were
to have &s;ome new &s;ettlements granted them by the King of Spain. The
directors books therefore were no &s;ooner opened for the fir&s;t
&s;ub&s;cription, but crowds came to make the exchange; the delu&s;ion
&s;pread; &s;ub&s;criptions in a few days &s;old for double the price they had
been bought for. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded, and the whole nation was infected
with a &s;pirit of avaricious enterprize. The infatu|ation prevailed; the
&s;tock increa&s;ed to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; but after a few months, the
people awak|ed from their delirium; they &s;ound that all the advantages to be
expected were merely imaginary; and an infinite number of families were
involved in ruin. Many of the directors who&s;e arts had rai&s;ed the&s;e vain
expectations, had ama&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;ing for|tunes: it was, however, one
con&s;olation to the na|tion, to find the parliament &s;tripping them of their
ill-acquired wealth; and orders were given to re|move all directors of the
South Sea company from their &s;eats in the hou&s;e of commons, or the places
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the government. The delin|quents being puni&s;hed
by a forfeiture of their e&s;tates, the parliament next converted its at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ention toward redre&s;&s;ing the
&s;ufferers. Several u&s;eful and ju&s;t re|&s;olutions were taken, and a bill
was &s;peedily prepared towards repairing the mi&s;chiefs. Of the profits
ari|&s;ing from the South-Sea &s;cheme, the &s;um of &s;even millions was
granted to the ancient proprietors; &s;e|veral additions al&s;o were made to
their dividends out of what was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the company in their own
right, the remaining capital &s;tock al&s;o was divided among all the
proprietors at the rate of thirty-three pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> In the mean
time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e,
demanding ju&s;tice; and the whole nation &s;eemed ex|a&s;perated to the
highe&s;t degree. During the&s;e tran&s;|actions, the King, with &s;erenity and
wi&s;dom pre&s;ided at the helm, influenced his parliament to pur&s;ue
equitable <PB N="133" REF="136"> mea&s;ures, and, by his councils, endeavoured
to re|&s;tore the credit of the nation.</P>
<P>The di&s;contents occa&s;ioned by the&s;e public cala|mities, once
more gave the di&s;affected party hopes of ri&s;ing. But, in all their councils
they were weak, divided, and wavering. Their pre&s;ent de&s;igns there|fore
could not e&s;cape the vigilance of the King, who had emi&s;&s;aries in every
court, and who had made, by his alliances, every potentate a friend to his
cau&s;e. He was therefore informed, by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France,
of a new con&s;piracy rai&s;ed again&s;t him by &s;everal per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction, which po&s;t|poned his intended journey to Hanover. Among
tho&s;e again&s;t whom the mo&s;t po&s;itive evidence was obtained, was Mr.
Chri&s;topher Layer, a young gen|tleman of the Middle Temple. He was convicted
of having inli&s;ted men for the pretender's &s;ervice, and received &s;entence
of death; which he under|went, after having been often examined, and having
&s;trenuou&s;ly refu&s;ed, to the la&s;t, to di&s;cover his accom|plices. He
was the only per&s;on who &s;uffered death upon this occa&s;ion; but &s;everal
noblemen of high di&s;tinction were made pri&s;oners upon &s;u&s;picion. The
Duke of Norfolk, the Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, the Lord Orrery, and the Lord
North and Grey were of this number. Of the&s;e all but the Bi&s;hop of
Roche&s;ter c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">me off without
puni&s;hment, the circum&s;tances not being &s;ufficient again&s;t them for
conviction. A bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t him,
although a Peer; and though it met with &s;ome op|po&s;ition, yet it was
re&s;olved by a great majority, that he &s;hould be deprived of his office and
benefice, and bani&s;hed the kingdom for ever. The Bi&s;hop made no defence in
the lower hou&s;e, re&s;erving all his power to be exerted in the hou&s;e of
Lords. In that a&s;&s;embly he had many friends; his eloquence, po|litene&s;s,
and ingenuity had procured him many; and his cau&s;e being heard, a long and
warm debate was <PB N="134" REF="137"> the con&s;equence. As there was little
again&s;t him but intercepted letters, which were written in cypher, the Earl
Pawlet in&s;i&s;ted on the danger and inju&s;tice of departing, in &s;uch
ca&s;es, from the fixed rules of evidence. The Duke of Wharton having &s;ummed
up the depo&s;itions, and &s;hewn the in&s;ufficiency of them, concluded with
&s;aying, That let the con&s;e|quences be what they would, he hoped the
lu&s;tre of that hou&s;e would be never tarni&s;hed, by condemning a man
without evidence. The Lord Bathur&s;t &s;poke al&s;o again&s;t the bill,
ob&s;erving, That if &s;uch extra|ordinary proceedings were countenanced, he
&s;aw no|thing remaining for him and others to do, but to re|tire to their
country-hou&s;es, and there, if po&s;&s;ible, quietly enjoy their e&s;tates
within their own families, &s;ince the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence, or intercepted
letter, might be made criminal. Then turning to the Bi|&s;hops, he &s;aid he
could hardly account for the inve|terate hatred and malice &s;ome per&s;ons
bore the in|genious Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, unle&s;s it was, that they were
infatuated like the wild Americans, who &s;ond|ly believe they inherit, not
only the &s;poils, but even the abilities of any man they kill. The Earl of
Strafford &s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ide; as al&s;o Lord Tre|vor, who ob&s;erved,
That if men were, in this un|precedented manner, proceeded again&s;t, without
le|gal proof, in a &s;hort time the mini&s;ter's favour would be the
&s;ubject's only protection; but that for him|&s;elf, no apprehen&s;ion of what
he might &s;uffer, would deter him from doing his duty. He was an&s;wered by
Lord Seafield, who endeavoured to &s;hew, that the evidence which had been
produced before them was &s;ufficient to convince any rea&s;onable man; and, in
this, he was &s;upported by the Duke of Argyle and Lord Lechmere. To the&s;e
Lord Cowper replied, That the &s;tronge&s;t argument urged in behalf of the
bill, was nece&s;&s;ity; but, for his part, he could &s;ee nothing that could
ju&s;tify &s;uch unprecedented, and <PB N="135" REF="138"> &s;uch dangerous
proceedings. The other party, how|ever, &s;aid little in an&s;wer; perhaps
already &s;en&s;ible of a majority in their favour. The bill was pa&s;&s;ed
again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and &s;everal Lords entered their prote&s;t. Among the
members of the hou&s;e of com|mons, who had exerted them&s;elves mo&s;t
&s;trenuou&s;ly in the Bi&s;hop's favour, was Doctor Friend, the cele|brated
phy&s;ician; and he was now taken into cu&s;|tody on &s;u&s;picion of
trea&s;onable practices. He was &s;oon after, however, admitted to bail; his
friend Doctor Mead becoming his &s;ecurity. In two days after the Bi&s;hop of
Roche&s;ter embarked for bani&s;h|ment, accompanied with his daughter; and, on
the &s;ame day that he landed at Calais, the famous Lord Bolingbroke arrived
there, in his return to England, having obtained his Maje&s;ty's pardon. Upon
which the Bi&s;hop, &s;miling, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>His Lord&s;hip and I are ex|changed.</HI></Q> In
this manner the Bi&s;hop continued in ex|ile and poverty till he died; though
it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that Doctor Sacheverel left him, by will,
five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Few tran&s;actions of importance happened during the remainder of
this reign; the mini&s;try were em|ployed in making various and expen&s;ive
negotiations, alliances, and treaties; covenants that are made with|out faith,
and only ob&s;erved from motives of intere&s;t or fear. The parliament made
al&s;o &s;ome efforts to cheek the progre&s;s of vice and immorality, which now
began to be diffu&s;ed through every rank of life; luxury and profligacy had
increa&s;ed to a &s;urpri&s;ing degrce; nor were there any tran&s;actions to
fill the page of hi&s;tory, except the mercenary &s;chemes of vile projectors,
or the ta&s;tele&s;s profu&s;ion of new-made opulence. The treaties lately
concluded with Spain were again broken, perhaps by every party; admiral
Ho&s;ier was &s;ent to intercept the Spani&s;h galleons from America; of which
the Spaniards being ap|prized, remanded back their trea&s;ure; and the
great|e&s;t <PB N="136" REF="139"> part of the Engli&s;h fleet, &s;ent on this
errand, was rendered, by the worms, entirely unfit for &s;ervice; and the men
were cut off by the unhealthy climate and long voyage. To retaliate this, the
Spaniards undertook the &s;iege of Gibraltar, and with &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s.
New treaties were &s;et on foot; France of|fered its mediation; and &s;uch a
reconciliation as treaties could procure was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The King had not now, for two years, vi&s;ited his German dominions;
and therefore &s;oon after the breaking up of parliament he prepared for a
journey to Hanover. Accordingly, having appointed an ad|mini&s;tration in his
ab&s;ence, he embarked for Hol|land; lay, upon his landing, at the little town
of Vert; next day proceeded on his journey; and, in two days more, between ten
and eleven at night, ar|rived at Delden, in all appearance in perfect health.
He &s;upped there very heartily, and eat an orange; and continued his
progre&s;s early the next morning. Between eight and nine he ordered the coach
to &s;top, and, it being perceived that one of his hands lay motionle&s;s,
mon&s;ieur Fabrice, who had formerly been the &s;ervant of the King of Sweden,
and now at|tended King George, chafed it between his. As this had no effect,
the &s;urgeon was called, who fol|lowed on hor&s;eback, and al&s;o rubbed it
with &s;pi|rits; &s;oon after the King's tongue began to &s;well, and he had
ju&s;t force enough to bid them ha&s;ten to O&s;naburgh; and, falling into
Fabrice's arms, quite in&s;en&s;ible, never recovered, but expired about eleven
o'clock the next morning. He died on Sunday the eleventh of June, in the
&s;ixty-eighth year of his age, and in the thirteenth of his reign. Whatever
was good or great in the reign of George I, ought to be attributed wholly to
him&s;elf; and whenever he deviated, it might ju&s;tly be imputed to a
mini&s;try al|ways partial, and often corrupt. He was almo&s;t ever
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nded with good fortune, which was
partly owing <PB N="137" REF="140"> to prudence, and more to a&s;&s;iduity. In
&s;hort, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es are the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance of how much may
be atchieved by moderate abilities, exerted with ap|plication and
uniformity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I Have not hitherto &s;aid any thing of the literature of the
pre&s;ent period, having re&s;olved to refer it to a &s;eparate letter, in
which we may have a more per&s;picu|ous view of it, than if blended with the
ordinary oc|currences of the &s;tate. Though learning had never received fewer
encouragements than in the pre&s;ent reign, yet it never flouri&s;hed more.
That &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy which had been excited in former ages, &s;till
continued to operate with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and produced the
greate&s;t men in every profe&s;&s;ion. Among the divines, Atterbury and Clarke
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves. As a preacher, Atterbury united all the graces
of &s;tyle with all the elegance of a ju&s;t deli|very; he was natural, polite,
&s;pirited; and his &s;er|mons may be ranked among the fir&s;t of this period.
Clarke, on the other hand, de&s;pi&s;ing the graces of eloquence, only &s;ought
after conviction, with rigorous though phlegmatic exactne&s;s, and brought
moral truths almo&s;t to mathematical preci&s;ion. Yet nei|ther he, Cudworth,
nor any other divine, did &s;uch &s;ervice to the rea&s;oning world, as the
great Mr. John Locke, who may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have reformed all our modes
of thinking in metaphy&s;ical inquiry. Though the jargon of &s;chools had been
before him arraigned, yet &s;everal of their errors had &s;till
&s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed, and were regarded as true. Locke therefore &s;et
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">im&s;elf to overturn their
&s;y&s;tems, and refute their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;urdities; the&s;e he effectually accompli&s;hed; for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hich rea&s;on his book, which,
when publi&s;hed, was <PB N="138" REF="141"> of infinite &s;ervice; it may be
found le&s;s u&s;eful at pre|&s;ent, when the doctrines it was calculated to
refute, are no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>Among the moral writers of this period, the Earl of Shafte&s;bury is
not to be pa&s;&s;ed over, who&s;e ele|gance, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
recompen&s;es for his want of &s;olidity. The opinions of all latter writers
upon moral &s;ubjects, are only derived from the ancients<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Morals are a &s;ubject on which the indu&s;try of men
has been exerci&s;ed in every age; and an infinite num|ber of &s;y&s;tems have
been the re&s;ult. That of Shafte&s;|bury, in which he e&s;tabli&s;hes a
natural &s;en&s;e of mo+ral beauty, was originally profe&s;&s;ed by Plato, and
only adorned by the Engli&s;h philo&s;opher. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed to be the age of &s;peculation. Berkeley,

ri&s;e; or, at lea&s;t, would have ne+ver &s;unk, if he had never publi&s;hed.
His work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> have appeared, and the
public are no longer in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
former &s;entiments. In mathematics and natural phi+lo&s;ophy, the vein opened

catalogue of the &s;tars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> while
Gregory reduced a&s;tronomy to one compre+hen&s;ive and regular &s;y&s;tem.
Doctor Friend, in me+dicine, produced &s;ome ingenious theories, which,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> they did not improve the art, at
lea&s;t &s;hewed his abi+lities and learning in his profe&s;&s;ion. Doctor

But, of all the other arts, poetry in this age was carried to the greate&s;t
perfection. The language, for &s;ome ages, had been improving, but now it
&s;eemed entirely di|ve&s;ted of its roughne&s;s and barbarity. Among the poets
of this period we may place John Philips, au|thor of &s;everal poems, but of
none more admired than that humourous one, intitled, <HI>The &s;plendid
Shil|ling;</HI> he lived in ob&s;curity, and died ju&s;t above want. William
Congreve de&s;erves al&s;o particular notice; his comedies, &s;ome of which
were but cooly received upon their fir&s;t appearance, &s;eemed to mend upon
re|petition; and he is, at pre&s;ent, ju&s;tly allowed the foremo&s;t in that
&s;pecies of dramatic poe&s;y. His wit is ever ju&s;t and brilliant; his
&s;entiments new and lively; and his elegance equal to his regularity. Next him
Vanburgh is placed, who&s;e humour &s;eems more natural, and characters more
new; but he owes too many obligations to the French, entirely to pa&s;s for an
original; and his total di&s;regard to decency, in a great mea&s;ure, impairs
his merit. Farquhar is &s;till more lively, and, perhaps, more entertaining
than either; his pieces &s;till continue the favourite performances of the
&s;tage, and bear frequent repe|tition without &s;atiety; but he often
mi&s;takes pertne&s;s for wit, and &s;eldom &s;trikes his characters with
pro|per force or originality. However, he died very young; and it is
remarkable, that he continued to improve as he grew older; his la&s;t play,
intitled <HI>The Beau Stratagem,</HI> being the be&s;t of his productions.
Addi&s;on, both as a poet and pro&s;e writer, de&s;erves
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he highe&s;t regard and imitation.
His Campaign, and Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy, are ma&s;ter|pieces in the
former, and his E&s;&s;ays publi&s;hed in the Spectator are inimitable
&s;pecimens of the latter. Whatever he treated of was handled with elegance
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd preci&s;ion; and that virtue
which was taught in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">is writings,
was enforced by his example. Steele <PB N="140" REF="143"> was Addi&s;on's
friend and admirer; his comedies ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
perfectly polite, cha&s;te, and genteel; nor were hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> other works contemptible; he wrote on &s;evera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubjects, and yet it is amazing, in
the multi|plicity of his pur&s;uits, how he found lei&s;ure fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of any. Ever
per&s;ecuted by credi|tors, whom his profu&s;ene&s;s drew upon him, or
pur+&s;uing impracticable &s;chemes, &s;ugge&s;ted by ill-ground|ed ambition.
Dean Swift was the profe&s;&s;ed antago|ni&s;t of both Addi&s;on and him. He
perceived that there was a &s;pirit of romance mixed with all the works of the
poets who preceded him; or, in other words, that they had drawn nature on the
mo&s;t plea&s;|ing &s;ide. There &s;till therefore was a place left for him,
who, carele&s;s of cen&s;ure, &s;hould de&s;cribe it ju&s;t as it was, with all
its deformities; he therefore owes much of his fame, not &s;o much to the
greatne&s;s of his genius, as to the boldne&s;s of it. He was dry,
&s;arca&s;tic, and &s;evere; and &s;uited his &s;tyle exactly to the turn of
his thought, being conci&s;e and nervous. In this period al&s;o flouri&s;hed
many of &s;ubordinate fame. Prior was the fir&s;t who adopted the French
elegant ea&s;y manner of telling a &s;tory; but if what he has borrowed from
that nation be taken from him, &s;carce any thing will be left upon which he
can lay claim to applau&s;e in poetry. Rowe was only out|done by Shake&s;pear
and Otway as a tragic writer; he has fewer ab&s;urdities than either; and is,
perhaps, as pathetic as they; but his flights are not &s;o bold, nor his
characters &s;o &s;trongly marked. Perhaps his coming later than the re&s;t may
have contributed to le&s;&s;en the e&s;teem he de&s;erves. Garth had
&s;ucce&s;s as a poet; and, for a time, his fame was even greater than his
de&s;ert. In his principal work, the Di&s;pen|&s;ary, his ver&s;ification is
negligent; and his plot is now become tedious; but whatever he may lo&s;e as a
poet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t would be improper to rob
him of the merit he de|&s;erves for having written the pro&s;e dedication, and 
<PB N="141" REF="144"> preface, to the poem already mentioned; in which he has
&s;hewn the true&s;t wit, with the mo&s;t refined ele|gance. Parnel, though he
has written but one poem, namely, the Hermit, yet has found a place among the
Engli&s;h fir&s;t-rate poets. Gay, likewi&s;e, by his Fables and Pa&s;torals,
has acquired an equal reputa|tion. But of all who have added to the &s;tock of
Engli&s;h poetry, Pope, perhaps, de&s;erves the fir&s;t place. On him
foreigners look as one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful writers of his time; his
ver&s;ification is the mo&s;t harmonious, and his correctne&s;s the mo&s;t
re|markable of all our poets. A noted cotemporary of his own, calls the
Engli&s;h the fine&s;t writers on mo|ral topics, and Pope the noble&s;t moral

la&s;t Engli&s;h Mu&s;e; and, indeed, &s;ince his time, we have &s;een &s;carce
any production that can ju&s;tly lay claim to immortality; he carried the

<P>Such was the learning of this period; it flouri&s;hed without
encouragement, and the Engli&s;h ta&s;te &s;eemed to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over
all Europe. The French tra|gedies began to be written after the model of ours;
our philo&s;ophy was adopted by all who pretended to rea&s;on for them&s;elves.
At pre&s;ent, however, when the learned of Europe are turned to the Engli&s;h
writers for in&s;truction, all &s;pirit of learning has cea&s;ed among&s;t us.
So little has been got by literature for more than an age, that none chu&s;e to
turn to it for preferment. Church preferments, which were once given as the
rewards of learning, have, for &s;ome time, deviated to the intriguing, venal,
and ba&s;e. All de&s;ire of novelty, in thinking, is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed among&s;t
us; and our &s;cholars, more plea&s;ed with &s;ecurity and ea&s;e than honour,
cooly follow the rea&s;onings of their predece&s;&s;ors, and walk round the
circle of former di&s;|covery.</P>

<P>UPON the death of George I, his &s;on George II<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;cended the throne, of inferior abilities to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> late King; and con&s;equently &s;till

th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> throne of England were, in
general, committed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
mini&s;ter's care; the royal concern being chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> fixed upon balancing the German powers, and gain+ing
an a&s;cendancy for the Elector of Hanover i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Empire. The mini&s;try was, at fir&s;t, divided be+tween Lord
Town&s;hend, a man of exten&s;ive know+ledge; the Earl of Che&s;terfield, the
only man of ge+nius employed under this government; and Sir Ro+bert Walpole,
who &s;oon after engro&s;&s;ed the greate &s;hare of the admini&s;tration to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Walpole, who is to make the principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> figure in the pre&s;ent reign, had, from low
begin+nings, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the head of the trea&s;ury<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Strongly attached to the hou&s;e of
Hanover, and &s;erv+ing it at times, when it wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he
&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> maintained the prejudices
with which he &s;et out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and,
unaware of the alteration of &s;entiments in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nation, &s;till attempted to govern by party. He, pro+bably, like
every other mini&s;ter, began by endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+ing to &s;erve his country; but, meeting with &s;tron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> oppo&s;ition, his &s;ucceeding
endeavours were rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> employed in
maintaining his po&s;t, than of being &s;er+viceable in it. The declining
prerogative of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> crown might have
been an early object of his atten+tion; but, in the &s;equel, tho&s;e very
mea&s;ures whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> he took to
increa&s;e it, proved to be the mo&s;t effec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+tual means of undermining it. As latterly all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <PB N="143" REF="146"> aims were
turned only to &s;erve him&s;elf, and his friends, he undertook to make a
majority in the hou&s;e of com|mons, by bribing the members; and, what was
&s;till wor&s;e, avowed the corruption. As all &s;pirit of in|tegrity was now
laughed out of the kingdom; and as the people were held to duty by no motives
of religious obedience to the throne, patrioti&s;m was ri|diculed, and venality
practi&s;ed without &s;hame. As &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of things naturally
produced oppo|&s;ition, Sir Robert was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t phlegmatic
in&s;en&s;ibility to bear reproach, and a calm di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate way of
rea&s;oning upon &s;uch topics as he de&s;ired to enforce. His di&s;cour&s;e
was fluent without elo|quence; and his rea&s;ons convincing, without any
&s;hare of elevation.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons, which, in the preceding reign, had been
di&s;tingui&s;hed into Whigs and Jaco|bites, now underwent another change, and
was again divided into the Court and Country party. The Court party were for
favouring all the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try, and applauding all the
mea&s;ures of the crown. They regarded foreign alliances as condu|cive to
internal &s;ecurity; and paid the troops of other countries for their
promi&s;es of future a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of the&s;e Sir Robert was the leader;
and &s;uch as he could not convince by his eloquence, he undertook to buy over
by places and pen&s;ions. The other &s;ide. who called them&s;elves the Country
party, were en|tirely aver&s;e to continental connexions; they com|plained that
immen&s;e &s;ums were lavi&s;hed on &s;ub&s;i|lies, which could never be
u&s;eful; and that alliances were bought with money, which &s;hould be only
re|warded by a reciprocation of good intentions. The&s;e
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ooked upon the frequent journies
of the King to his Electoral dominions with a jealous eye, and &s;ome|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">mes hinted at the alienation of the royal affections
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">om England. Mo&s;t of the&s;e had
been &s;trong a&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rtors of the
Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and, not fearing <PB N="144" REF="147"> the
reproach of Jacobiti&s;m, they &s;poke with &s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> greater boldne&s;s. As the Court party generally
threa|tened the hou&s;e of commons with imaginary danger to the &s;tate; &s;o
the&s;e of the Country u&s;ually de claimed again&s;t the incroachments of the
preroga+tive. The threats of neither were founded i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> truth; the kingdom was in no danger
from abroad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor was internal
liberty in the lea&s;t infringed by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> crown. On the contrary, tho&s;e who viewed the &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> with an unprejudiced eye, were of
opinion that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> prerogatives of
the crown were the only part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
con&s;titution that was growing every day weaker; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> while the King's thoughts were turned to foreig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> concerns, the mini&s;try were unmindful

Wyndham, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Hungerford.</P>
<P>The great objects of controver&s;y during this reig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were the national debt, and the number

with the affairs of the continent; that expences were incurred with|out
prudence or nece&s;&s;ity; and that the increa&s;e of the national debt, by
multiplying taxes, would, at length, become intolerable to the people.
What|ever rea&s;on there might be in &s;uch arguments, they were
notwith&s;tanding con&s;tantly over-ruled; and every demand granted with
plea&s;ure and profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the&s;e treaties and alliances, however, in which the kingdom
had been lately involved, &s;eemed no|way productive of the general tranquility
expected from them. The Spaniards, who had never been thoroughly reconciled,
&s;till continued their depreda|tions, and plundered the Engli&s;h merchants
upon the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of America, as if they had been pi|rates. This was
the reign of negotiations; and, from the&s;e alone, the mini&s;try promi&s;ed
them&s;elves and the nation redre&s;s. Still, however, the enemy went on to
in&s;ult and &s;eize, regardle&s;s of our vain ex-po&s;tulations. The Briti&s;h
merchants complained, by petition, of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the
Spaniards; and the hou&s;e of commons deliberated upon this &s;ubject. They
examined the evidence, and pre&s;ent|ed an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty. He
promi&s;ed them all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, and negotiations were begun as
formerly. And a new treaty was &s;igned at Vienna be|tween the Emperor and the
Kings of Great Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the former. Though &s;uch
tran&s;actions did not give the &s;ecurity that was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">xpected from them, yet they, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, put off the troubles of Europe for a time. An interval of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eace &s;ucceeded, in which
&s;carce any events hap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ened that

at Vienna the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing of England
conceived hopes, that the peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urope was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t la&s;ting founda|tion. 
<PB N="146" REF="149"> Don Carlos, upon the death of the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Parma, was, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
an Engli&s;h fleet, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in
peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma and Placentia. Six thou&s;and Spaniards
were quietly admitted, and quar|tered in the Duchy of Tu&s;cany, to &s;ecure
for him the rever&s;ion of that Dukedom. Thus we &s;ee Eu|rope, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, re&s;embling a republic, put|ting Monarchs into new kingdoms, and
depriving others of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by an univer&s;al concur|rence. But
this amicable di&s;po&s;ition among the great powers can never continue long;
and the republic of Europe will be but an empty name, until there be &s;ome
controlling power &s;et up by univer&s;al con&s;ent, to enforce obedience to
the law of nations.</P>
<P>During this interval of profound peace, nothing remarkable happened,
except the con&s;tant di&s;puta|tions in the hou&s;e of commons, where the
conte&s;ts between the Court and Country party were carried on with the
greate&s;t acrimony; the &s;peeches, on either &s;ide, being dictated le&s;s by
rea&s;on than re&s;ent|ment. A calm unintere&s;ted reader is now &s;urprized at
the heat with which many &s;ubjects of little im|portance in them&s;elves, were
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at that time; he now &s;miles at tho&s;e denunciations of ruin
with which their orations are replete. The truth is, the liberty of a nation is
better &s;upported by &s;uch an op|po&s;ition, than by what is &s;aid in the
oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In times of profound tranquility the &s;lighte&s;t oc|currences
become objects of univer&s;al attention. A &s;ociety of men, intitled, <HI>The
charitable Corporation,</HI> excited the indignation of the public. Their
pro|fe&s;&s;ed intention was, to lend money at legal intere&s;t to the poor,
upon &s;mall pledges; and to per&s;ons of better rank, upon proper &s;ecurity.
Their capital was at fir&s;t limited to thirty thou&s;and pounds; but they
afterwards increa&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and. This money was granted
in by &s;ub&s;cription; and the care of conducting the capital was intru&s;ted
to a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> <PB N="147" REF="150">
number of directors. This company, having con|tinued for more than twenty
years, the ca&s;hier, George Robin&s;on, and the warehou&s;e-keeper of the
company, di&s;appeared in one day. Five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds of the
capital appeared to be &s;unk, and embezzled by the directors, in a manner the
proprietors could not account for. They there|fore petitioned the hou&s;e,
repre&s;enting the manner in which they had been defrauded of &s;uch va&s;ts
&s;ums of mo|ney, and the di&s;tre&s;s to which many were reduced to, in
con&s;equence of &s;uch impo&s;ition. The petition was received, and a &s;ecret
committee appointed to inquire into the grievance. They &s;oon di&s;covered a
mo&s;t iniquitous &s;cene of fraud, which had been carried on by Thomp&s;on and
Robin&s;on, in concert with &s;ome of the directors, for embezzling the
capital, and cheating the proprietors. Many per&s;ons of rank and quality were
concerned in this infamous con&s;piracy; &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in
the nation did not e&s;cape without cen&s;ure. The hou&s;e of commons declared
their re&s;entment, and expelled one or two of their members; but the
&s;ufferers met with &s;carce any re|dre&s;s. Nor can I mention &s;uch a
circum&s;tance with|out reflecting on that &s;pirit of rapacity and avarice
which infected every degree of people. An ill ex|ample in the governing part of
a country ever diffu&s;es it&s;elf downward; and, while the mini&s;try do not
blu&s;h at detection, the people of every rank will not fear guilt. About this
time not le&s;s than five members of parliament were expelled for the mo&s;t
&s;ordid acts of knavery; Sir Robert Sutton, Sir Archibald Grant, and George
Robin&s;on, for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rauds in the
management of the <HI>Charitable Corpora|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion</HI> &s;cheme; Dennis Bond, E&s;quire; and Serjeant Burch, for a
fraudulent &s;ale of the late Earl of Der|wentwater's forfeited e&s;tates.
Luxury had produced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rodigality,
the &s;ure parent of every meanne&s;s. It was even a&s;&s;erted in the hou&s;e
of Lords, that not <PB N="148" REF="151"> one &s;hilling of the forfeited
e&s;tates was ever applied to the &s;ervice of the public; but became the
reward of avarice and venality.</P>
<P>Another occurrence of a more private nature, about this time,
excited public compa&s;&s;ion, not without a degree of horror: Richard Smith, a
book|binder, and his wife, had long lived together, and &s;truggled with
tho&s;e wants, which, notwith&s;tanding the profu&s;ion of the rich at this
time, oppre&s;&s;ed the poor. Their mutual tenderne&s;s for each other, was the
only comfort they had in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which di&s;tre&s;&s;es were
increa&s;ed by having a child, which they knew not how to maintain. At length,
they took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of dying by their own hands; the child's
throat was cut, and the hu&s;band and wife were found hanging in their
bed-chamber. They left a letter behind, containing the rea&s;ons which in|duced
them to this act of de&s;peration; they declar|ed, that they could no longer
&s;upport a life of &s;uch complicated wretchedne&s;s; and thought it
tender|ne&s;s to take their child with them, from a world where they
them&s;elves had found no compa&s;&s;ion. Suicide, in many in&s;tances, is
a&s;cribed to phrenzy: we have here an in&s;tance of &s;elf-murder, concerted
with compo&s;ure, and borrowing the aids of rea&s;on for its vindication.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of England has little, during this interval, to excite
curio&s;ity. The debates in parliament grew every day more ob&s;tinate, as
every &s;ubject happened to come round in voting the an|nual &s;upplies. But as
the &s;ubjects were mo&s;tly the &s;ame, &s;o al&s;o were the arguments. There
was one, <PB N="149" REF="152"> however, of a different nature from tho&s;e in
the u&s;ual cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, which was laboured for &s;tre|nou&s;ly by
the mini&s;try, and as warmly oppo&s;ed by their antagoni&s;ts, namely, the
exci&s;e bill, which Sir Robert Walpole introduced into the hou&s;e, by fir&s;t
declaiming again&s;t the frauds practi&s;ed by the factors in London, who were
employed by the American planters in &s;elling their tobacco. To prevent
the&s;e frauds he propo&s;ed, in&s;tead of having the cu&s;toms levied in the
u&s;ual manner upon tobacco, that what was imported &s;hould be lodged in
warehou&s;es ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e by the officers of the crown; from
thence to be &s;old, after paying the duty of four-pence <HI>per</HI> pound,
when the proprietor found a market for it. This propo&s;al rai&s;ed a violent
ferment, not le&s;s in the hou&s;e than without doors. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed
the &s;cheme, a&s;&s;erted, that this &s;cheme would expo&s;e the factors to
&s;uch hard&s;hips, that they would not be able to continue the trade, nor
would it prevent the frauds complained of. They a&s;&s;erted, that it would
produce an additional &s;warm of exci&s;e|officers and warehou&s;e-keepers,
which would at once tender the mini&s;try formidable, and the people
de|pendant. Arguments, however, were not what the mini&s;try mo&s;t dreaded;
for the people had been rai&s;ed into &s;uch a ferment, that all the avenues to
the hou&s;e were crowded with complaining multitudes; and Sir Robert Walpole
began even to fear for his life. The mini&s;try carried the propo&s;al in the
hou&s;e; but, ob&s;erv|ing the tumult of the people, they thought fit to drop
the de&s;ign. The mi&s;carriage of the bill was celebrated with public
rejoicings in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the mini&s;ter was burned in
effigy by the popu|lace.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;s, in the members of the oppo&s;ition, encouraged
them to go on to a propo&s;al for repeal|ing an act made in the la&s;t reign,
by which the hou&s;e of commons was to be &s;eptennial. They propo&s;ed 
<PB N="150" REF="153"> that parliaments &s;hould again be made triennial, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been &s;ettled at the revolution.
In the cour&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> this debate, in
which they were oppo&s;ed, as u&s;ual, by the mini&s;try, they reflected, with
great &s;everity, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mea&s;ures
of the late reign. They a&s;&s;erted, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;eptennial act was an incroachment on the right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the people; that during the
continuance of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> parliament,
&s;everal &s;evere laws had been enacted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that by one of the&s;e a man might be removed, and tried in any
place where the jury might be favour|able to the crown, and where the
pri&s;oners witne&s;&s;es could not, or dare not, to come. That, by another, a
ju&s;tice of the peace was impowered to put the be&s;t &s;ubjects to immediate
death only, after reading a pro|clamation again&s;t riots. The South-Sea
&s;cheme, they &s;aid, was e&s;tabli&s;hed by an act of a &s;eptennial
parliament; and the exci&s;e bill had like, under their influence al&s;o, to
have pa&s;&s;ed into a law. Sir Wil|liam Wyndham di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in
this debate: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Let us &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>a man
without any &s;en&s;e of honour rai&s;ed to be a chief mini&s;ter of &s;tate.

will never occur; but &s;hould &s;uch ever happen to be at once united, a
&s;hort parliament will be the only means of le&s;&s;ening the evil.</HI></Q>
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e expo&s;tulations, the mini&s;try were, as u&s;ual,
vic|torious, and the motion &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the majo|rity. The Country
party now found them&s;elves out-numbered upon every occa&s;ion; they had long
complained, in vain, that debate was u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince every member &s;eemed
to have li&s;ted him&s;elf under the banners of party, to which he held without
&s;hrinking. De&s;pairing therefore of being able to &s;tem the torrent of
corruption, they retired to their &s;eats in the coun|try, 
<PB N="151" REF="154"> and left the mini&s;try an undi&s;puted majority in the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter being now left without oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e,
took this opportunity to render his ri|vals odious or contemptible, by getting
&s;everal u&s;eful laws pa&s;&s;ed in their ab&s;ence; while the King
labour|ed, with equal a&s;&s;iduity, to adju&s;t the political &s;cale of
Europe; and, for this purpo&s;e, made &s;everal journies to his Electoral
dominions. But his a&s;&s;iduity in heal|ing foreign differences did not
prevent one of a more dome&s;tic nature; for a mi&s;under&s;tanding aro&s;e
be|tween him and the Prince of Wales; a Prince that was the darling of the
people, and who profe&s;&s;ed his di&s;like both of the mini&s;try and their
venal mea&s;ures. He had been, a &s;hort time before, married to the Prince&s;s
of Saxegotha; and the Prince's mi&s;taking a me&s;&s;age from the King, at a
time when the Prin|ce&s;s was lying-in, fir&s;t cau&s;ed the rupture. It was
&s;oon after widened by the vile emi&s;&s;aries of the court, &s;o that his
Maje&s;ty forbade the Prince his pre&s;ence; and gave orders that none of his
attendants &s;hould be admitted to court. A motion, however, was made in the
hou&s;e of commons, for increa&s;ing the Prince's &s;ettlement, which was but
fifty thou&s;and pounds, to an hundred thou&s;and. It was repre&s;ented that
&s;o much had been granted by the late King, to his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty, when
Prince of Wales; and that &s;uch a &s;ettlement was conformable to the practice
of for|mer times, and nece&s;&s;ary to the independency of the heir apparent to
the Engli&s;h crown. This motion was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir Robert
Walpole, as an incroachment on the prerogative, and an officious in|termeddling
in the King's family affairs. The &s;up|porters of the motion ob&s;erved, that
the allowance of fifty thou&s;and pounds was not &s;ufficient to defray the
Prince's yearly expences, which, by his Maje&s;ty's own regulation, amounted to
&s;ixty-three thou&s;and. The motion, however, met the fate of all other
anti|mini&s;terial <PB N="152" REF="155"> mea&s;ures, being rejected by the
majo|rity.</P>
<P>But whatever imaginary di&s;appointments the people might &s;uffer,
there was a blow levelled at the little wit that was left remaining, which has
effectually bani&s;hed all ta&s;te from the &s;tage, and from which it has
never &s;ince recovered. When Walpole entered into power, he re&s;olved to
de&s;pi&s;e that &s;et of under|rate writers, who live by arraigning every
mini&s;try, and di&s;&s;eminate &s;candal and abu&s;e. For a time he
pro&s;ecuted that intention; but, at la&s;t, found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to employ
a &s;et of mean hirelings, to an&s;wer calumny with calumny. He wanted judgment
to di&s;tingui&s;h genius; or none po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a gift were mean
enough to applaud his mea&s;ures. From hence he took an implacable aver&s;ion
to the pre&s;s, which &s;o &s;everely expo&s;ed his corruption, and branded his
follies. But the pre&s;s alone was not the only &s;courge he had to fear; the
theatre joined all its ri|dicule, and he &s;aw him&s;elf expo&s;ed as the
object of &s;corn, as well as hatred. When licen&s;e once tran&s;|gre&s;&s;es
the rules of decency, it knows no bounds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Some of the pieces exhibited at that time were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> only &s;evere, but immoral al&s;o. This

hou&s;e applauded his wit and elo|quence; and the que&s;tion was carried
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The di&s;contents occa&s;ioned by &s;uch proceedings at home, were
&s;till more increa&s;ed by the depredations of the Spaniards. They di&s;puted
the right of the Engli&s;h to cut logwood in the Bay of Campeachy in America; a
right which had been often acknow|ledged, but never clearly explained, in all
former treaties between the two kingdoms. Their <HI>Guarda Co&s;tas</HI>
plundered the Engli&s;h merchants with impu|nity; and, upon the lea&s;t
re&s;i&s;tance, behaved with in&s;olence, cruelty, and rapine. The &s;ubjects
of Bri|tain were buried in the mines of Poto&s;i, deprived of all means of
conveying their complaints to their protectors, and their ve&s;&s;els
confi&s;cated, in defiance of ju&s;tice. The Engli&s;h court made frequent
re|mon&s;trances to that of Madrid, of this outrageous violation of treaties.
and they received for an&s;wer only promi&s;es of inquiry, which produced no
refor|mation. Our merchants loudly complained of the&s;e outrages; but the
mini&s;ter expected, from negotia|tion, that redre&s;s which could only be
obtained by arms. He knew that a war would increa&s;e the diffi|culties he had
to encounter; and he was &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e he already encountered
required all his art and indu&s;try to remove. A war, he was &s;en&s;ible,
would require expences which he wi&s;hed to &s;hare in peace. In &s;hort, all
his mea&s;ures now were not to &s;erve the &s;tate, but to pre&s;erve his
power. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he indu&s;triou&s;ly endcavoured
to avoid a rupture. The fears he di&s;covered only &s;erved to 
<PB N="154" REF="157"> increa&s;e the enemies in&s;olence and pride. However
the complaints of the Engli&s;h merchants were loud enough to reach the hou&s;e
of commons; their let|ters and memorials were produced, and their griev|ances
enforced at the bar by council. The hou&s;e, at length, agreed to an addre&s;s,
to intreat his Maje&s;ty to obtain effectual relief, and to convince Spain that
its indignities would be no longer borne with impunity. The&s;e complaints
produced a convention between the two crowns, concluded at Prado, importing,
that two plenipotentiaries &s;hould meet at Madrid, to regulate the
re&s;pective preten&s;ions of either kingdom, re&s;pect|ing the trade in
America, and the limits of Florida and Carolina. The&s;e conferences were to be
fini&s;h|ed in eight months; and, in the mean time, all ho|&s;tile preparations
&s;hould cea&s;e on either &s;ide. His Catholic Maje&s;ty agreed to pay the
King of Great Bri|tain ninety-five thou&s;and pounds, to &s;atisfy the de|mands
of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects upon the crown of Spain, after deducting from the
whole the demands of the crown and &s;ubjects of Spain upon that of Britain.
Such an agreement as this was ju&s;tly re|garded on the &s;ide of the Briti&s;h
mini&s;try as a ba&s;e de&s;ertion of the honour and intere&s;ts of their
coun|try. And when the hou&s;e of commons came to take the convention under
con&s;ideration, it produced the warme&s;t debate. All the adherents to the
Prince of Wales had joined in the oppo&s;ition. It was alledg|ed, that the
Spaniards, in&s;tead of granting a redre&s;s, had rather extorted a relea&s;e
for their former conduct. That they &s;till a&s;&s;erted their former right to
&s;earch|ing Engli&s;h &s;hips, and had not &s;o much as men|tioned the word
<HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> in all the treaty. Not|with&s;tanding all the
remon&s;trances again&s;t this treaty, the majority of the hou&s;e declared in
its favour; and &s;everal members of the oppo&s;ite &s;entiment retired from
parliament, having de&s;paired of being longer <PB N="155" REF="158">
&s;erviceable in a place where party, and not rea&s;on, prevailed.</P>
<P>As Spain had engaged to pay a large &s;um of money by this
convention, &s;ome time after, when the mini|&s;ter demanded a &s;upply, upon a
different occa&s;ion, Lord Bathur&s;t moved to know, whether Spain had paid the
&s;ums &s;tipulated, as the time limited for the payment was expired. The Duke
of Newca&s;tle, by his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, acquainted the hou&s;e, that
it was not paid; and that Spain had a&s;&s;igned no rea|&s;on for the delay. In
&s;ome mea&s;ure, therefore, to atone for his former &s;lowne&s;s, the
mini&s;ter now be|gan to put the nation into a condition for war. Let|ters of
repri&s;al were granted again&s;t the Spaniards. The&s;e preparations were
regarded by the Spani&s;h court as actual ho&s;tilities. The French
amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague declared, that the King his ma&s;ter was obliged,
by treaties, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of Spain; he di&s;&s;uaded the Dutch from
e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Eng|land; who promi&s;ed him an inviolable
neutrality. It is curious enough to con&s;ider the revolutions which the
political &s;y&s;tem of Europe had undergone. But about twenty years before,
France and Eng|land were combined again&s;t Spain; at pre&s;ent, France and
Spain united again&s;t England. Tho&s;e &s;tate&s;men who build upon alliances
as a la&s;ting ba&s;is of power, will, at length, find them&s;elves fatally
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>A rupture between Great Britain and Spain being now become
inevitable, the people, who had long clamoured for war, began to feel uncommon
alacrity at its approach; and the mini&s;try finding it unavoid|able, began to
be earne&s;t in preparation. Orders were i&s;&s;ued for augmenting the land
forces, and rai&s;|ing a body of marines. Two rich Spani&s;h prizes were taken
in the Mediterranean, and war declared again&s;t them in form. Admiral Vernon
was &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies, commander of the fleet, in order
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o di&s;tre&s;s the Spaniards in
that part of the globe. <PB N="156" REF="159"> Vernon was a rough and hone&s;t
&s;oldier, untainted with the corruption or the effeminacy of the times. He
had, in the hou&s;e of commons, a&s;&s;erted, that Porto-Bello, a fort and
harbour in South America, might be ea&s;ily taken, and that he him&s;elf would
undertake to reduce it with &s;ix &s;hips only. A pro|ject which appeared &s;o
wild, and impo&s;&s;ible, was ri|diculed by the mini&s;try; but, as he &s;till
in&s;i&s;ted upon the propo&s;al, they were plea&s;ed in complying with his
reque&s;t. This would at once rid them of a trouble|&s;ome antagoni&s;t in the
hou&s;e; and, in ca&s;e of his failure, there would be a new cau&s;e of triumph
in his di&s;grace. In this, however, they were di&s;appointed. The admiral,
with &s;ix &s;hips only, attacked and de|moli&s;hed all the fortifications of
the place, and came away victorious, almo&s;t without blood&s;hed. This dawning
of &s;ucce&s;s upon the Briti&s;h arms induced the hou&s;e of commons to enter
vigorou&s;ly into the King's mea&s;ures for carrying on the war. They in|abled
him to equip a very powerful navy; they voted a &s;ub&s;idy to the King of
Denmark, and impowered their Sovereign to defray &s;ome other expences, not
&s;pecified in the e&s;timates; the whole of their grants amounting to about
four millions. The war was carried on with vigour, and the debates in the
hou&s;e of commons became le&s;s violent. In a nation, like England, of arts,
arms, and commerce, war, at cer|tain intervals of time, mu&s;t ever be
&s;erviceable. It turns the current of wealth from the indu&s;trious to the
enterpri&s;ing. Thus, all orders of mankind find encouragement, and the nation
becomes compo&s;ed of individuals, who have &s;kill to acquire property, and
who have courage to defend it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>A War between England and Spain was &s;ufficient to communicate
di&s;turbances over all the globe. Countries that were once too ob&s;cure to be
known, were now &s;een to &s;end out fleets, one &s;hip of which was capable of
de&s;troying all the naval power of an A&s;iatic empire. A &s;quadron of
&s;hips commanded by Commodore An&s;on was equipped, in order to &s;ail through
the Streights of Magellan into the South Sea, and to act again&s;t the enemy on
the coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru. This fleet was to co-operate occa&s;ionally
with Admiral Vernon acro&s;s the I&s;thmus of Darien; but the delays and
blunders of the mini&s;try fru&s;trated this &s;cheme, though originally well
laid. However, though too late in the &s;ea&s;on, the Commodore &s;et forward
with five &s;hips of the line, a frigate, and two &s;tore-&s;hips, &s;upplied
with provi&s;ions and other mer|chandize, de&s;igned to carry on a trade with
the &s;a|vage inhabitants of that part of the world, or to conciliate their
affections. The number of men a|mounted, in all, to about fourteen hundred,
includ|ing two hundred invalids taken from the ho&s;pitals, and two hundred new
rai&s;ed recruits. This whole expedition is a fine in&s;tance of the power of
per&s;e|verance in forcing fortune. The Commodore &s;teer|ed his cour&s;e by
the i&s;land of Madeira, proceeded to the Cape Verd I&s;lands, and &s;ailed
along the coa&s;ts of Brazil. He refre&s;hed for &s;ome time at the i&s;land of
St. Catharine, in twenty-&s;even degrees of &s;outhern latitude; a &s;pot that
enjoys all the verdure and fruit|age of tho&s;e luxurious climates. From this
place he &s;teered &s;till onward into the cold and tempe&s;tuous cli|mates of
the &s;outh, along the coa&s;t of Patagonia; and, in about five months, entered
the famous Streights of Magellan. After having &s;uffered the mo&s;t violent
tem|pe&s;ts he doubled Cape Horn; the re&s;t of his fleet were 
<PB N="158" REF="161"> di&s;per&s;ed or wrecked; his crew deplorably di&s;abled
by the &s;curvy; and his own &s;hip with difficulty ar|rived on the I&s;land of
Juan Fernandez. In this de|licious abode he remained for &s;ome time, where
na|ture &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to con&s;ole mankind far the calamities
of their own avarice and ambition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
In order to improve &s;till farther a retreat of &s;uch elegance, he ordered
&s;everal European &s;eeds and fruits to be &s;own upon the i&s;land, which
increa&s;ed to &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing degree, that &s;ome Spaniards, who,
&s;eve|ral years after, landed there, and found them in plenty, could not avoid
acknowledging this act of genero&s;ity and benevolence. Here the Commodore was
joined by one &s;hip more of his fleet, and by the Tryal frigate of &s;even
guns. Advancing now north|ward, towards the tropic of Capricorn, he attacked
the city of Payta by night. In this bold attempt he made no u&s;e of his
&s;hips, nor even landed all his men. A few &s;oldiers landed by night, and
filled the whole town with terror and confu&s;ion. The governor of the
garri&s;on, and the inhabitants, fled on all &s;ides; accu&s;tomed to cruelty
over a conquered enemy them|&s;elves, they expected a &s;imilitude of
treatment. In the mean time, for three days, a &s;mall number of Engli&s;h kept
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, and &s;tripped it of all its trea&s;ures and
merchandize, to an immen&s;e a|mount. Such of the negroes as had not fled were
made u&s;e of in carrying the goods of their former ma&s;ters on board the
Engli&s;h &s;hipping; and the Spa|niards refu&s;ing to treat &s;oon &s;aw their
town all in flames. This, however, was but a &s;mall puni&s;h|ment for all the
cruelties which they had practi&s;ed in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
country, upon its fir&s;t in|habitants. The plunder of this place &s;erved to
in|rich the captors; and the ravage made among them, by the &s;curvy, &s;till
increa&s;ed the &s;hare of every &s;ur|vivor. This &s;mall &s;quadron now came
up as far as Pa|nama, &s;ituated on the Streights of Darien. Thus they 
<PB N="159" REF="162"> came upon on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the great American
continent; and Admiral Vernon was expcted to &s;ucceed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide
nearer home. Thus the Spani&s;h Empire was attacked on both &s;ides; but the
&s;cheme failed from Vernon's want of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>An&s;on, who now only commanded two &s;hips, the remainder having
either put back to England, or, being wrecked by the tempe&s;ts, bounded all
his hopes to the taking one of tho&s;e rich Spani&s;h &s;hips, which trade
between the Philippine i&s;lands, near the coa&s;t of China and Mexico, on the
Spani&s;h main. But one or two, at the mo&s;t, of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els
pa&s;&s;ed from one continent to the other in a year. The &s;hips are made
immen&s;ely &s;trong, large, and carry great quan|ties of trea&s;ure and
merchandize. The Commodore therefore, and his little fleet, traver&s;ed that
great ocean lying between the A&s;iatic and American con|tinent, in hopes of
meeting this rich prize, which it was hoped would, at this time of the year,
return from the Ea&s;t, and would amply repay the adventurers for all their
dangers and fatigues. Avarice thus became honourable when pur&s;ued through
peril and di&s;tre&s;s. But the &s;curvy once more vi&s;ited his mariners, now
long kept at &s;ea, and without fre&s;h provi&s;ions. This di&s;order, though
it takes the &s;ame name, is very dif|ferent from that on land. The &s;ea
&s;curvy is attend|ed with an univer&s;al putrefaction, the teeth loo&s;en, old
wounds that had been healed again open, and &s;ometimes the limbs are &s;een to
drop off at the joints. By this terrible di&s;order &s;everal of his men daily
fell, and others were di&s;abled. One of his &s;hips be|coming leaky, and the
number of his hands decrea&s;|ing, he thought proper to &s;et it on fire in the
mid&s;t of the ocean. His fleet now being reduced only to one &s;hip, called
the <HI>Centurion,</HI> of &s;ixty guns, and all the crew in the mo&s;t
deplorable &s;ituation, he ca&s;t an|chor on the de&s;erted i&s;land of Tinian,
which lies About half way between the old and new world. <PB N="160" REF="163">
This i&s;land had &s;ome years before been peopled by near thirty thou&s;and
inhabitants, but an epidemical di&s;temper coming among them, de&s;troyed a
part; and the re&s;t for&s;ook the place. Nothing, however, could exceed the
beauty of this &s;pot. The mo&s;t ro|mantic imagination cannot form a &s;cene
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing what Tinian naturally afforded; greens, groves, ca&s;|cades,
fields, flowers, and pro&s;pects. This retreat &s;aved the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron. All that a &s;ea-beaten company of mariners could wi&s;h, they
found here in great abundance; clear and whole&s;ome water, me|dicinal herbs,
dome&s;tic animals, and other nece&s;&s;a|ries for refitting their &s;hattered
ve&s;&s;el. Thus refre&s;h|ed, he went forward towards China, pa&s;&s;ed by the
kingdom of Formo&s;a, and went up the river Canton in order to careen the only
&s;hip that now was left him. Being thus far on his way homeward, nothing can
better te&s;tify the hardy and untameable &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h, than his
venturing once more back into the &s;ame ocean where he had experienced &s;uch
a va|riety of di&s;tre&s;s. The Commodore having put his ve&s;&s;el into good
order, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Chi|ne&s;e, and having taken Dutch and
Indian &s;ailors on board, he again returned towards America. At length, on the
9th of June, he di&s;covered the galleon he &s;o ardently expected. This
ve&s;&s;el was formed as well for the purpo&s;es of war as of merchandize. It
mount|ed &s;ixty guns and five hundred men, while the crew of the Commodore did
not exceed half that number. The engagement &s;oon began; but as tho&s;e who
op|po&s;e have always the advantage of tho&s;e who de|fend, and as the
Engli&s;h are more expert in naval affairs than any other nation; the Spani&s;h
&s;hip &s;oon became the Centurion's prize. There were but a few men killed on
the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, while the Spaniards lo&s;t near &s;eventy. The
conqueror now returned to Canton oncemore with his prize. He there maintained
the honour of his country, in re|fu&s;ing <PB N="161" REF="164"> to pay the
impo&s;ts which were laid upon ordi|nary merchants; and in&s;i&s;ted that an
Engli&s;h &s;hip of war was exempted from &s;uch a duty. From Canton he
proceeded to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and pro&s;e|cuted his voyage to
England, where he arrived in &s;afety, with immen&s;e riches. His la&s;t prize
was valued at three hundred and thirteen thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling; and the
different captures that had been made before this la&s;t piece of good fortune,
might amount to as much more. Upon his return, Commodore An&s;on received all
that honour which prudence and per&s;everance de&s;erve. He &s;oon became the
oracle con&s;ulted in all naval deliberations; the King after wards rai&s;ed
him to the dignity of the peerage; and he was made fir&s;t Lord of the
Admiralty.</P>

<P>THE expedition of An&s;on took up near three years. The Engli&s;h,
in the mean time, car|ried on their operations again&s;t Spain with vigour, and
various &s;ucce&s;s. When An&s;on had &s;et out, it was only to act a
&s;ubordinate part to a formidable armament, de&s;igned for the coa&s;ts of New
Spain, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-nine &s;hips of the line, and al|mo&s;t an
equal number of frigates, furni&s;hed with all kinds of warlike &s;tores, and
near fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen, and twelve thou&s;and land forces. Never was
a fleet more completely equipped, nor never had the nation more &s;anguine
hopes of victory. Lord Cathcart commanded the land forces; but, dying on the
pa&s;&s;age, the command devolved upon General Wentworth, who&s;e chief merit
was his favour with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e in
power. This, with &s;everal other unfortunate
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ircum&s;tances, concurred to
fru&s;trate the hopes of the <PB N="162" REF="165"> Public. The mini&s;try,
without any vi&s;ible rea&s;on, had detained the fleet in England until the
&s;ea&s;on for action was almo&s;t over. In the country where they were to
carry on their operations, periodical rains begin about the end of April; and
this change in the atmo&s;phere is always attended with epidemical
di&s;|tempers. They, at length, however, &s;et &s;ail for the continent of New
Spain; and, after &s;ome tempe&s;ts, and &s;ome delays, arrived before
Carthagena. This city, which lies within &s;ixty miles of Panama, &s;erves as
the magazine for the Spani&s;h merchandize, which is brought from Europe
hither, and from thence tran|&s;ported, by land, to Panama, lying on the
oppo&s;ite coa&s;t. The taking of Carthagena therefore would interrupt the
whole trade between Old Spain and the New. The troops were landed on the
i&s;land Terra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of the
Bocca-Chica, which was fortified with all the arts of engineering. The
Bri|ti&s;h forces erected a battery on &s;hore, with which they made a breach
in the principal fort, while the Admiral &s;ent in a number of &s;hips to
divide the fire of the enemy; and to co-operate with the endea|vours of the
army. The breach being deemed prac|ticable, the forces advanced to the attack;
but the Spaniards de&s;erted the forts; which, had they cou+rage, they might

&s;uffering incredible &s;laughter, with the mo&s;t &s;e+rene intrepidity, they
were, at length, obliged to re+tire. <PB N="163" REF="166"> Bad provi&s;ions, a
horrid climate, and epidemi|cal fever, &s;till more contributed to thin their
num|bers, and to deprive them of all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. It was determined
therefore to reimbark the troops, and to conduct them, as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, from this &s;cene of &s;laughter and contagion. The
fortifications and harbour were demoli&s;hed; and the fleet returned to
Jamaica. This fatal mi&s;carriage, which tarni&s;hed the Briti&s;h arms, was no
&s;ooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and
di&s;|content; a mea&s;ure which, if it had &s;ucceeded, would have crowned the
promoters of it with honour, now only &s;erved to cover them with reproach. The
greate&s;t part of this di&s;content fell upon the mini|&s;ter; his former
conduct, which ju&s;tly de&s;erved cen|&s;ure, was not &s;o powerfully objected
again&s;t him, as this failure, of which he was innocent. It is not vil|lainy,
but misfortune that finds cen&s;ure from man|kind. Be&s;ides, the activity of
the enemy, in di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing the trade of England contributed to increa&s;e
the murmurs of the people. Their privateers were &s;o numerous and
&s;ucce&s;sful, that in the beginning of this year they had taken, &s;ince the
commencement of the war, four hundred and &s;even &s;hips, belonging to the
&s;ubjects of Great Britain. The Engli&s;h, though at immen&s;e expence in
equipping fleets, &s;eemed tame|ly to lie down under every blow, and &s;uffered
one lo&s;s after another without repri&s;al. This general di&s;|content had a
manife&s;t influence upon the election of members for the new parliament. All
the adherents of the Prince of Wales, who now lived, retired from the court as
a private gentleman, concurred in the oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try.
Ob&s;tinate &s;truggles were maintained in all parts of the kingdom; and &s;uch
a national &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition prevailed, that the Country intere&s;t
&s;eemed, at length, to preponderate
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n the hou&s;e of commons. It was
&s;oon &s;een that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;t
of the mini&s;ter was in the wane, and that <PB N="164" REF="167"> opinion,

to act with neutra|lity.

<P>Sir Robert now tottered on the brink of ruin. He was &s;en&s;ible
that nothing but a divi&s;ion in the oppo|&s;ition could give him &s;afety. The
Prince was his mo&s;t formidable rival; a Prince revered by the whole nation,
for his humanity, benevolence, and candour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The&s;e were only private virtues; but the&s;e were
al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had then a liberty of
exerci&s;ing. The mini&s;ter's fir&s;t attempt was, to endeavour taking him
from the party; a me&s;&s;age therefore was carried to his roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> highne&s;s by the Bi&s;hop of Oxford,
importing, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Prince would
write a letter to the King, he and all his coun&s;ellors &s;hould be taken into
favour, fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be added to his revenue, two hundred
thou&s;and given him to pay his debts, and &s;uitable provi&s;ion &s;hould be
made, in due time, for all his followers. This, to a Prince already involved in
debt, from the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up his dignity<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> was a tempting offer; but his royal highne&s;s
gene|rou&s;ly di&s;dained it, declaring he would accept no &s;uch conditions
which were dictated to him under the influence of Sir Robert Walpole. The
mini&s;ter now therefore &s;aw that no arts could di&s;&s;olve the combination
again&s;t him; he re&s;olved, as an expiring &s;truggle, to try his &s;trength
once more in the hou&s;e of commons upon a di&s;puted election; but he had the
mortification to &s;ee the majority &s;till increa&s;ed again&s;t him by
&s;ixteen voices. He then declared he would never &s;it in that hou&s;e more.
The parliament was adjourned the next day, and Sir Robert being created Earl of
Orford, re&s;igned all his employments. Never was a joy more univer&s;al and
&s;incere than this re&s;ignation produced. The people now flattered
them&s;elves that all their dome&s;tic grievances would find redre&s;s; that
their commerce would be protected abroad; that the war would be carried on with
vi|gour; <PB N="165" REF="168"> and that the hou&s;e of commons would be
unanimous in every mea&s;ure. But they were di&s;ap|pointed in mo&s;t of their
expectations. The mi&s;con|duct of a mini&s;ter is more likely to affect his
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;or than him&s;elf, as a weak reign ever produces a feeble
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The hou&s;e of commons had been for a long time increa&s;ing
in power, and Walpole, with all his arts, was, in fact, rather weakening than
extending the prerogative. By his method of brib|ing oppo&s;ition he had taught
the venal to oppo&s;e him; and, by his increa&s;ing the national debt, he
weakened the vigour of the crown in war, and made it more dependant upon
parliament in times of peace. A part of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him were
therefore &s;en&s;ible of this, and &s;till re&s;olved to &s;upport the crown,
which they regarded as the only declining branch of the con&s;titution. Another
part, who cla|moured from motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t, having now attained the
object of their de&s;ires, blundered on in the former mea&s;ures, &s;tudious of
fortune and not of fame. In &s;hort, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors pur&s;uing all the
former &s;chemes of the depo&s;ed mini&s;ter, pre&s;ented the poli|tical part
of the nation with the mortifying pro&s;pect of pretended patrioti&s;m
un&s;tripped of its ma&s;k, and &s;hewed the little certainty there is in all

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE war with Spain had now continued for &s;everal years, with but
indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. Some in&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions were carried on in
the We&s;t-Indies under Admiral Vernon, Commodore Knowles, and others; and
the&s;e were all aggravated by a &s;et of worthle&s;s and mercenary
<HI>things,</HI> called <HI>Political Writers.</HI> A cla&s;s of beings fir&s;t
employed again&s;t <PB N="166" REF="169"> Walpole, and afterwards encouraged by
him, at the expence, as it is &s;aid, of not le&s;s than thirty thou|&s;and a
year. The&s;e were men naturally too dull to &s;hine in any of the politer
kinds of literature, which might adorn either a &s;cholar or a gentleman; and
therefore they turned their thoughts to politics; a &s;cience on which they
might declaim without know|ledge, and be dull without detection. The&s;e men, I
&s;ay, had, for &s;ome time, embarra&s;&s;ed the con&s;titution, inflamed the
people, and were paid with large pen|&s;ions from the crown. It was upon this
occa&s;ion that they exaggerated every mi&s;conduct, and drew fright|ful
pictures of the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery which they foreboded to po&s;terity.
This clamour, and want of &s;ucce&s;s in a naval war, in which the principal
&s;trength of the kingdom lay, induced the new mini&s;try to di|vert the
attention of the public to a war, which might be carried on by land. The King's
attach|ment to his Electoral dominions contributed &s;till more to turn the
current of Briti&s;h indignation that way, and an army was therefore now
prepared to be &s;ent into Flanders; the war with Spain being be|come an object
of &s;econdary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To have a clear, yet conci&s;e, idea of the origin of the troubles
on the continent, it will be expedient to go back, for &s;ome years, and trace
the mea&s;ures of the European republic to that period where we for|merly left
them. After the Duke of Orleans, who had been regent of France, died, Cardinal
Fleury undertook to &s;ettle that confu&s;ion in which the former had left the
kingdom. His moderation was equal to his prudence; he was &s;incere, frugal,
mode&s;t, and &s;imple. Under him France repaired her lo&s;&s;es, and inriched
her&s;elf by commerce; he only left the &s;tate to its own natural methods of
thriving, and &s;aw it daily a&s;&s;uming its former health and vigour. During
the long interval of peace, which his councils had procured for Europe, two
powers, unregarded, now <PB N="167" REF="170"> began to attract the notice, and
the jealou&s;y of their neighbouring &s;tates. Peter the Great had already
civi|lized Ru&s;&s;ia, and this new exten&s;ive empire began to influence the
councils of other Princes, and to give laws to the North. The other power was
that of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e dominions were compact and popu|lous, and who&s;e
forces were well maintained, and ready for action. The Empire continued under
Charles VI, who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of Utrecht.
Sweden langui&s;hed, be|ing not yet recovered from the de&s;tructive projects
of Charles XII. Denmark was powerful; and part of Italy &s;ubject to the
ma&s;ters which had been impo&s;ed upon it by foreign treaties. All, however,
continued to enjoy a profound peace, till the death of Au|gu&s;tus, King of
Poland, again kindled up the gene|ral flame. The Emperor Charles VI,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the arms of Ru&s;&s;ia, declared for the Elector of Saxony,
&s;on to the decea&s;ed King. On the other hand, France declared for
Stani&s;laus, who had been long &s;ince elected King of Poland by Charles XII,
and who&s;e daughter had been &s;ince married to the French King. Stani&s;laus
repaired to Dantzick in order to &s;upport his election; ten thou&s;and
Ru&s;&s;ians appear|ing, the Poli&s;h nobility di&s;per&s;ed, and their new
elect|ed Monarch was &s;hut up, and be&s;ieged by &s;o &s;mall a number of
forces: the city was taken, and the King
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;caped with the utmo&s;t
difficulty, being made a pri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oner,
and fifteen hundred Frenchmen that were &s;ent
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o his a&s;&s;i&s;tance were made
pri&s;oners of war. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ad now no
hopes left but in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, which accordingly re&s;olved
to give him powerful &s;uc|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ours,
by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The views
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f France were &s;econded by Spain
and Sardinia; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oth hoped to grow
more powerful by a divi&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he
&s;poils of Au&s;tria; and France had motives of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">liance and revenge. A French army
therefore &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ver-ran the empire
under the conduct of old Mar&s;hal <PB N="168" REF="171"> Villars; the Duke of
Montemar, the Spani&s;h gene|ral, was equally victorious in the kingdom of
Na|ples; and the Emperor, Charles VI, had the morti|fication of &s;eeing
him&s;elf deprived of the greate&s;t part of Italy, for having attempted to
give a King to Poland. The&s;e rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es of France and its allies
&s;oon compelled the Emperor to demand a peace. By this treaty Stani&s;laus,
upon who&s;e account the war was undertaken, was obliged to renounce all right
to the throne of Poland; and France made &s;ome valuable acque&s;ts of
dominion; particularly the Duchy of Lorrain. In the year 1740, the death of the
Emperor gave the French another opportunity of exerting their ambition.
Regardle&s;s of treaties, particularly the pragmatic &s;anction, as it was
called, which &s;ettled upon the daughter of the Emperor the rever&s;ion of all
his dominions, they cau&s;ed the Elec|tor of Bavaria to be crowned Emperor.
Thus the daughter of Charles VI, de&s;cended from an illu&s;tri|ous line of
Emperors, &s;aw her&s;elf &s;tripped of her in|heritance, and, for an whole
year, without hopes of &s;uccour. She had &s;carce clo&s;ed her father's eyes,
when &s;he lo&s;t Sile&s;ia, by an irruption of the young King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
who &s;eized the opportunity of her defencele&s;s &s;tate, to renew his ancient
preten&s;ions to that province of which it mu&s;t be owned his ance&s;|tors had
been unju&s;tly deprived. France, Saxony, and Bavaria, attacked the re&s;t of
her dominions. In this forlorn &s;ituation &s;he found a powerful ally in
Britain; Sardinia and Holland &s;oon after came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and,
la&s;t of all, Ru&s;&s;ia joined in her cau&s;e. It may be demanded, What part
Britain had in the&s;e continental mea&s;ures? The intere&s;ts of Hanover; the
&s;ecurity and aggrandizement of that Electorate, depended upon the proper
regulation of the empire. Lord Carteret had now taken that place in the royal
confidence which had formerly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Walpole; and, by
pur&s;uing the&s;e mea|&s;ures <PB N="169" REF="172"> he &s;oothed the wi&s;hes
of his ma&s;ter, and opened a more exten&s;ive field for his own ambition. He
ex|pected honour from victories which could produce no good; and campaigns,
whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not, that could only terminate in misfortune. When
the par|liament met, his Maje&s;ty informed them of his &s;trict adherence to
his engagements, though attacked in his own dominions; and that he had
augmented the Bri|ti&s;h forces in the Low Countries with &s;ixteen thou|&s;and
Hanoverians. When the &s;upplies came to be con&s;idered, by which this
additional number of troops was to be paid, it rai&s;ed violent debates in both
hou&s;es. It was con&s;idered as hiring the troops of the Electorate to fight
their own cau&s;e. The mi|ni&s;try, however, who were formerly remarkable for
declaiming again&s;t continental mea&s;ures, now boldly &s;tood up for them;
and, at length, by dint of num|ber, carried their cau&s;e. The people &s;aw,
with pain, their former defenders &s;acrificing the blood and trea|&s;ure of
the nation upon de&s;tructive alliances; they knew not now on whom to rely for
&s;afety; and be|gan to think that patrioti&s;m was but an empty name. However
injurious the&s;e mea&s;ures might have been to the nation, they were of
infinite &s;ervice to the Queen of Hungary. She began, at this period, to
triumph over all her enemies. The French were driven out of Bohemia. Her
general, Prince Charles, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of
Bavaria. Her rival, the nominal Emperor, was obliged to fly before her;
abandoned by his allies, and &s;tripped of all his dominions, he repaired to
Francfort, where he lived in indigence and ob&s;curity. He agreed to remain
neuter during the remainder of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he
war; while the French, who fir&s;t began it as al|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, &s;upported the burthen. The troops &s;ent by
England to the Queen's a&s;&s;i&s;tance were commanded by the Earl of Stair, an
experienced commander, who had learned the art of war under the famous 
<PB N="710" REF="173"> Prince Eugene; and the chief object he had fir&s;t in
view was, to effect a junction with the army com|manded by Prince Charles of
Lorrain. The French, in order to prevent this junction, a&s;&s;embled &s;ixty
thou&s;and men upon the river Mayne, under the com|mand of Mar&s;hal Noailles,
who po&s;ted his troops upon the ea&s;t &s;ide of that river. The Briti&s;h
forces, to the number of forty thou&s;and, pu&s;hed forward on the other
&s;ide, while the French, in the mean time, found means to cut off all the
communications by which they could be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The King of
England arrived at the camp while the army was in this &s;ituation; and
&s;eeing it in danger of &s;tarving, re&s;olved to proceed forward, to join
twelve thou&s;and Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, who had reached Hanau. With
this view he decamped; but before the army had marched three leagues, he found
the enemy had inclo&s;ed him on every &s;ide, near a village called Detingen..
In this &s;ituation he mu&s;t have fought at great di&s;advantage, if he began
the attack; and if he continued in the &s;ame &s;ituation, his army mu&s;t have
peri&s;hed for want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The impetuo&s;ity of the French, how|ever, &s;aved the

&s;uperior the pre&s;ent times are in point of humanity to the boa&s;ted ages
of antiquity. Though the Eng|li&s;h were victorious upon this occa&s;ion, yet
the Earl of Stair, who commanded, did not a&s;&s;ume any ho|nour from &s;uch a
victory; he was unwilling that his reputation &s;hould &s;uffer for mea&s;ures,
which he was not allowed to conduct; he therefore &s;olicited, and obtained
leave to re&s;ign; and the Briti&s;h troops de|&s;i&s;ted from further
operations that campaign.</P>
<P>Mean while the French went on with vigour on every quarter; they
oppo&s;ed Prince Charles of Lor|rain, and interrupted his progre&s;s in his
attempts to pa&s;s the Rhine, gained &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Italy; but their
chief expectations were placed in a projected in|va&s;ion of England. Cardinal
Fleury was now dead, and Cardinal Tencin &s;ucceeded to his place a per&s;on of
a very different character from his predece&s;&s;or, proud, turbulent, and
enterprizing. France. from the violence of parliamentary di&s;putes in England,
had been long per&s;uaded that the country was ripe for a revolution, and only
wanted the pre&s;ence of the Pretender to induce the majority to declare
again&s;t the reigning family. Several needy adventurers, who wi&s;hed for a
change; &s;ome men of broken fortunes, and almo&s;t all the Roman Catholics of
the kingdom, endeavoured to confirm the court of France in the&s;e
&s;entiments. An inva&s;ion therefore was actually pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ected. Charles, &s;on of the old Chevalier St. George,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eparted from Rome in the
di&s;gui&s;e of a Spani&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ourier, and pro&s;ecuting his journey to Paris, had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n audience of the French King. The
troops de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">igned for this expedition
amounted to fifteen thou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">and;
preparations were made for embarking them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t Dunkirk, and &s;ome other of the
neare&s;t ports to England, under the eye of the young Pretender; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">even thou&s;and of the number
actually went on <PB N="172" REF="175"> board. The Duke de Roquefuille, with
twenty &s;hip of the line, was to &s;ee them landed &s;afely in England; and
Count Saxe was to command them, when put a&s;hore. The whole project, however,
was di&s;con|certed by the appearance of Sir John Norris, with a &s;uperior
fleet, making up again&s;t them; the French fleet was obliged to put back; a
very hard gale of wind damaged their tran&s;ports beyond redre&s;s. All hopes
of inva&s;ion were now fru&s;trated; and, at length, the French thought fit
openly to declare war.</P>
<P>But, though fortune &s;eemed to favour England on this occa&s;ion,
yet, on others, &s;he was not equally propitious. The combined fleets of France
and Spain, for &s;ome time, fought the Briti&s;h armament under Admiral
Matthews and Le&s;tock, though with infe|rior forces, and came off upon nearly
equal terms, Such a parity of &s;ucce&s;s in England was regarded as a defeat.
Both the Engli&s;h Admirals were tried by a court-martial; Mathews, who had
fought the ene|my with intrepidity, was declared incapable of &s;erv|ing for
the future in his Maje&s;ty's navy. Le&s;tock, who had kept aloof, was
acquitted with honour, for he had intrenched him&s;elf within the punctilios of
di&s;cipline; he barely did his duty; a man of honour, when his country is at

<P>The proceedings in the Netherlands were &s;till more unfavourable.
The French had a&s;&s;embled a formid|able army of one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and men; the chief command of which was given to Count Saxe. This
General was originally a &s;oldier of for|tune, and natural &s;on to Augu&s;tus
King of Poland, by the famous Counte&s;s of Konig&s;mark. He had been bred from
his youth in camps, and had &s;hewn the mo&s;t early in&s;tances of cool
intrepidity. He, in the beginning of the war, had offered his &s;ervice to
&s;everal crowns, and, among the re&s;t, it is &s;aid, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat of England; but his offers
were rejected. He <PB N="173" REF="176"> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great
military talents; and, by long habit, pre&s;erved an equal compo&s;ure in the
mid&s;t of battle, as in a drawing-room at court. On the other &s;ide, the
allied forces, con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h, Hano|verians, Dutch, and
Au&s;trians, did not amount to above &s;eventy thou&s;and. The&s;e were
incapable of with&s;tanding &s;uch a &s;uperior force, and commanded by &s;uch
a General. The French be&s;ieged and took Fribourg, before they went into
winter quarters; and early the next campaign inve&s;ted the city of Tournay.
The allies were re&s;olved to prevent the lo&s;s of this city by a battle.
Their army was infe|rior, and they were commanded by the Duke of Cum|berland.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages they marched towards the enemy, and
took po&s;t in &s;ight of the French army, which was incamped on an eminence;
the village of Antoine on the right, a wood on their left, and the town of
Fontenoy before them. This advantageous &s;ituation did not repre&s;s

re&s;olved to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> 
<PB N="175" REF="178"> an effort at gaining the Briti&s;h crown. Young Charles
Edward, the adventurer in que&s;tion, had been bred in a luxurious court
without &s;haring its effeminacy; he was enterpri&s;ing and ambitious; but,
either from inexperience, or natural inability, utterly unequal to the
undertaking. He was flattered by the ra&s;h, the &s;uper&s;titious, and the
needy, that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt; that the people could no longer
bear the immen&s;e load of taxes, which was daily in|crea&s;ing; and that the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the kingdom would gladly &s;eize the
opportunity of crowding to his &s;tandard. Being furni&s;hed with &s;ome money,
and &s;till larger promi&s;es from France, who fanned this ambition in him,
from which they hoped to gain &s;ome advantages; he embarked for Scot|land on
board a &s;mall frigate, accompanied by the Marquis Tullibardine, Sir. Thomas
Sheridan, and a few other de&s;perate adventurers. For the conque&s;t of the
whole Briti&s;h empire he brought with him &s;even officers, and arms for two
thou&s;and men. For|tune, which ever per&s;ecuted his family, &s;eemed no way
more favourable to him; his convoy, a &s;hip of &s;ixty guns, was &s;o
di&s;abled in an engagement with an Engli&s;h man of war, called the
<HI>Lion,</HI> that it re|turned to Bre&s;t, while he was obliged to continue
his cour&s;e to the we&s;tern parts of Scotland; and, landing on the coa&s;t of
Lochaber, he was, in a little time, joined by &s;ome chiefs of the Highland
Clans, and their va&s;&s;als. The&s;e chiefs had ever continued to exerci&s;e
an hereditary juri&s;diction over all their tenants. This power of life and
death ve&s;ted in the Lords of the manor, was a privilege of the old feu|dal
law, long aboli&s;hed in England, but which had been confirmed to the Scotch
lairds at the time of the union. From hence we &s;ee, that a chief had the
power of commanding all his va&s;&s;als, and that im|mediate death was the
con&s;equence of their di&s;obey|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng. By means of the&s;e chiefs therefore he &s;oon 
<PB N="176" REF="179"> &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of fifteen hundred men; and
invited others to join him by his manife&s;toes, which were di&s;per&s;ed
throughout all the Highlands.</P>
<P>The boldne&s;s of this enterprize a&s;toni&s;hed all Eu|rope; it
awakened the fears of the pu&s;illanimous, the pity of the wi&s;e, and the
loyalty of all. The whole kingdom &s;eemed unanimou&s;ly bent upon oppo&s;ing
the enterprize, which they were &s;en&s;ible, as being &s;up|ported only by
Papi&s;ts, would be in&s;trumental in re|&s;toring Popery. The mini&s;try was
no &s;ooner con|firmed of the truth of his arrival, which, at fir&s;t, they
could &s;carely be induced to believe, than Sir John Cope was ordered to
oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. In the mean time, the young adventurer marched to
Perth, where the unnece&s;&s;ary ceremony was perform|ed of proclaiming the
Chevalier de St. George, his father, King of Great Britain. The rebel army,
de&s;cending from the mountains, &s;eemed to gather as it went. They advanced
towards Edinburgh, which they entered without oppo&s;ition. Here too the
pa|geantry of proclamation was performed, in which he promi&s;ed to
di&s;&s;olve the union, and redre&s;s the grievances of the country. But,
though he was ma&s;ter of the capital, yet the citadel, which goes by the name
of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> a &s;trong fortre&s;s built upon a rock, and
commanded by General Gue&s;t, braved all his attempts. In the mean time, Sir
John Cope, who had pur&s;ued them to the Highlands, but declin|ed meeting them
in their de&s;cent, now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons, re&s;olved to
march towards Edinburgh, and give them battle. The young adventurer, unwilling
to give him time to re|treat, attacked him near Pre&s;ton-pans, about twelve
miles from the capital, and, in a few minutes, put him and his troops totally
to the route. This vic|tory, in which the King lo&s;t about five hundred men,
gave the rebels great influence; and, had the Pre|tender taken advantage of the
general con&s;ternation, <PB N="177" REF="180"> and marched towards England,
the con&s;equence might have been dangerous to the &s;afety of the &s;tate; but
he &s;pent the time at Edinburgh, &s;eeming to enjoy the u&s;ele&s;s parade of
royalty, plea&s;ed at being addre&s;&s;ed and treated as a King. By this time
he was joined by the Earl of Kilmarnock, the Lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy,
Pit&s;ligo, and the elde&s;t &s;on of the Lord Lovat. This Lord Lovat was the
&s;ame whom we have &s;een, upon a former occa&s;ion, tru&s;ted by the old
Pretender, and betraying him by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of
Stirling for King George. This nobleman, true to neither party, had again
altered from his attachment to the hou&s;e of Hanover, and, in &s;ecret, aided
the young Cheva|lier; &s;tudious only for his own intere&s;t, he exerted all
the arts of low cunning, to appear an open enemy to the rebellion; yet to give
it &s;ecret a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>While the young Pretender thus trifled away the time at Edinburgh,
(for all delays in dangerous en|terprizes are even wor&s;e than defeats) the
mini&s;try of Great Britain took every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to de|feat his
intentions. Six thou&s;and Dutch troops that had come over to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the crown, were &s;ent northward, under the command of
General Wade; but, as it was then &s;aid, the&s;e could lend no
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as they were, properly &s;peaking, pri&s;on|ers of France,
and, upon their parole, not to oppo&s;e that power for the &s;pace of one year.
How|ever this be, the Duke of Cumberland &s;oon after arrived from Flanders,
and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry; voluntiers in
different parts of the kingdom employed them&s;elves
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n the exerci&s;e of arms; and
every county exerted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> generous

<P>It would be illiberal and ba&s;e, to deny this enter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">i&s;ing youth that prai&s;e which his
merit may de&s;erve. <PB N="178" REF="181"> Though he might have brought civil
war, and all the calamities attending it, with him, into the kingdom; yet we
mu&s;t con&s;ider, that he had ever been taught that bathing his country in
blood was but a ju&s;t a&s;|&s;ertion of his right; that altering the
con&s;titution and, perhaps, the religion of his &s;uppo&s;ed dominions was a
laudable object of ambition. Thus in&s;pired he went forward with vigour, and
re&s;olving to make an irruption into England, he entered it by the we&s;tern
border, on the &s;ixth day of November. Car+li&s;le was inve&s;ted, and, in

was here joine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> by about two
hundred Engli&s;h men, who were forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> into a regiment, under the command of Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Townley.

Che&s;ter int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wales, where he
hoped for a great number of adhe+rents. He was, by this time, advanced within
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> hundred miles of the capital,
which was filled wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> terror and
confu&s;ion. The King re&s;olved to take th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> field in per&s;on. The voluntiers of the city were in+corporated 
<PB N="179" REF="182"> into a regiment. The practitioners of the law re&s;olved
to take the field, with the judges at their head. Even the managers of the
theatres of|fered to rai&s;e a body of their dependants for the &s;er|vice of
their country. Yet the&s;e combinations only &s;erved as in&s;tances of the
national terror; for the trading part of the city, and tho&s;e concerned in the
money corporations, were overwhelmed with dejec|tion. They could hope for
little &s;afety in the cou|rage or di&s;cipline of a militia, e&s;pecially as
they, every hour, dreaded an inva&s;ion from France, and an in&s;urrection of
the Roman Catholics, and other friends to the expelled family. This therefore
was the moment for the advancement of the adventurer's enterprize. Had he
marched up to the capital, he would undoubtedly have been joined by &s;everal,
&s;e|cretly attached to his cau&s;e. But he determined to retreat once more to
Scotland; and thus his &s;cheme was defeated. In fact, he was but nominally the
leader of his forces. His Generals, the chiefs of Highland Clans, were, from
their education, igno|rant; and, from their independency, ob&s;tinate. They
each embraced peculiar &s;y&s;tems, and began to con|tend with each other for
the pre-eminence; &s;o that after violent di&s;putes, they re&s;olved to march
back. They effected their retreat to Carli&s;le without any lo&s;s; and from
thence cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland. In this irruption,
however, they pre&s;erved all the rules of war; they de&s;i&s;ted, in a great
mea&s;ure, from rapine; levied contributions; and, in the u&s;ual form, left a
garri&s;on at Carli&s;le in their retreat; which, a &s;hort time after, to the
num|ber of four hundred, &s;urrendered, to the Duke of Cumberland, pri&s;oners
at di&s;cretion. The Pretender, being returned to Scotland, proceeded to
Gla&s;gow; from which city he exacted &s;evere contributions. Advancing to
Stirling, he was joined by Lord Lewis Gordon, at the head of &s;ome forces
which had been <PB N="180" REF="183"> a&s;&s;embled in his ab&s;ence. Other
Clans, to the num|ber of two thou&s;and, came in likewi&s;e; Spain &s;ent him
&s;ome &s;upplies of money; and, in one or two &s;kirmi&s;hes with the
loyali&s;ts, his Generals came off with victory; &s;o that his affairs once
more &s;eemed to wear an a&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Being joined by John Lord
Drummond, he inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, commanded by General
Blakeney; but his forces be|ing unu&s;ed to &s;ieges, con&s;umed much time to
no purpo&s;e. General Hawley, who commanded a con|&s;iderable body of forces
near Edinburgh, undertook to rai&s;e the &s;iege. He advanced towards the rebel
army, and rendezvou&s;ed his whole force at Falkirk, while the rebels lay
incamped at no great di&s;tance. After two days, mutually examining each
other's &s;trength, the rebels, on the &s;eventeenth day of Janu|ary, came on
in full &s;pirits to attack the King's army. The Pretender, who &s;tood in the
front line, gave the &s;ignal to fire; and the fir&s;t volley &s;erved to put
Hawley's forces into confu&s;ion. The hor&s;e re|treated with precipitation,
and fell in upon their own infantry; the rebels followed their blow; and the
greate&s;t part of the royal army fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. They
retired in confu&s;ion to Edin|burgh, leaving the field of battle, with part of
their tents and artillery, to the rebels.</P>
<P>This was the end of all their triumphs. A new &s;cene of conduct was
now going to open; for the Duke of Cumberland, at that time the favourite of
the Engli&s;h army, had put him&s;elf at the head of the troops at Edinburgh,
which con&s;i&s;ted of about fourteen thou&s;and men. He re&s;olved therefore
to come to a battle as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and marched forward, while the
young adventurer retired at his approach. The Duke advanced to Aberdeen, where
he was joined by the Duke of Gordon, and &s;ome other Lords, attached to his
family and cau&s;e. After having refre&s;hed his troops here for &s;ome time,
he re|newed <PB N="181" REF="184"> his march; and, in twelve days, came upon
the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey. This was a place where the rebels
might have di&s;puted his pa&s;&s;age; but they &s;eemed now totally void of
all coun&s;el and &s;ubordination, without conduct, and without expectation.
The Duke &s;till proceeded in his pur&s;uit; and, at length, had advice that
the ene|my had advanced from Inverne&s;s to the Plain of Culloden, which was
about nine miles di&s;tant, and there intended to give him battle. On this
Plain the Highlanders were drawn up in order of battle, to the number of eight
thou&s;and men, in thirteen divi&s;ions, &s;upplied with &s;ome pieces of
artillery. The battle began about one o'clock in the afternoon; the canon of
the King's army did dreadful execution among the enemy, while theirs, being but
ill &s;erved, was ineffectual. One of the great errors in all the Pre|tender's
warlike mea&s;ures, was his &s;ubjecting undi&s;|ciplined troops to the forms
of artful war, and thus repre&s;&s;ing their native ferocity, from which alone
he could hope for &s;ucce&s;s. After they had &s;tood the Engli&s;h fire for
&s;ome time, they, at length, became impatient for clo&s;er engagement; and
about five hun|dred of them attacked the Engli&s;h left wing, with their
accu&s;tomed fiercene&s;s. The fir&s;t line being di&s;|ordered by this
on&s;et, two battalions advanced to &s;upport it, and galled the enemy by a
terrible and clo&s;e di&s;charge. At the &s;ame time the dragoons un|der
Hawley, and the Argyle&s;hire militia, pulling down a park wall that guarded
the enemy's flank, and which the rebels had left but feebly defended, fell in
among them, &s;word in hand, with great &s;laugh|ter. In le&s;s than thirty
minutes they were totally routed, and the field covered with their wounded and
&s;lain, to the number of above three thou&s;and men. Civil war is in it&s;elf
terrible, but &s;till more &s;o when heightened by cruelty. How guilty &s;oever
men may be, it is ever the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;oldier to remember, 
<PB N="182" REF="185"> that he is only to fight an enemy that oppo&s;es him,
and to &s;pare the &s;upplicant. This victory was in every re&s;pect complete;
and humanity to the con|quered would even have made it glorious. The
con|querors often refu&s;ed mercy to wretches who were defencele&s;s or
wounded; and &s;oldiers were &s;een to anticipate the ba&s;e employment of the
executioner.</P>
<P>Thus &s;unk all the hopes, and the ambition of the young adventurer;
one &s;hort hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and &s;ceptres, and reduced
him from a nominal King to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed forlorn out-ca&s;t, &s;hunned by
all mankind, except &s;uch as &s;ought to take his life. To the good-natured,
&s;ub&s;equent di&s;|tre&s;s often atones for former guilt; and while rea&s;on
would repre&s;s humanity, yet our hearts plead in the favour of the wretched.
The Duke, immediately after the deci&s;ive action at Culloden, ordered
&s;ix-and-thirty de&s;erters to be executed; the conquerors &s;pread terror
wherever they came; and, after a &s;hort time, the whole country round was one
&s;cene of &s;laughter, de&s;olation, and plunder; ju&s;tice &s;eemed
forgotten; and vengeance a&s;&s;umed the name.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the unhappy fugitive adventurer wandered from
mountain to mountain, a wretched &s;pectator of all the&s;e horrors, the
re&s;ult of his ill-guided ambition. He now underwent a &s;imiliarity of
adventures with Charles II, after the defeat at Worce&s;ter. He &s;ometimes
found refuge in caves and cottages, without attendants, and expo&s;ed to the
mercy of pea&s;ants, who could pity but not &s;upport him. Sometimes he lay in
fore&s;ts, with one or two companions of his di&s;tre&s;s, continually purfued
by the troops of the conquerors, as there was thirty thou&s;and pounds bid for
his head. Sheridan, an Iri&s;h adventurer, was he who kept mo&s;t faithfully by
him, and in&s;pired him with courage to &s;upport &s;uch incre|dible
hard&s;hips. He was obliged to tru&s;t his life to the fidelity of about fifty
individuals. One day, hav|ing <PB N="183" REF="186"> walked from morning till
night, pre&s;&s;ed by hun|ger, and worn with fatigue, he ventured to enter an
hou&s;e, the owner of which he well knew was at|tached to the oppo&s;ite party:

<Q REND="inline"><HI>The &s;on of your King,</HI> &s;aid he,

&s;ecret. In this manner he wandered among the frightful wilds of Glengarry,
for near &s;ix months, often hemmed round by his pur&s;uers, but &s;till
find|ing &s;ome expedient to &s;ave him from captivity and death. At length a
privateer of St. Malo, hired by his adherents, arrived in Lochnanach, on which

<P>Many were the conjectures then, and they &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as
to the po&s;&s;ibility of the young adventurer's e&s;cape. Some were of opinion
that the government gave &s;ecret orders to the Generals to connive at it;
while others &s;till firmly a&s;&s;ert, that he was put to death in an
out-hou&s;e, in which a number of the re|bels were inclo&s;ed and burnt. Which

tried by their Peers, and found guilty. Cro+martie was pardoned; the other two
were beheaded on Tower-Hill. Kilmarnock, either from convic|tion, or from the
hope of a pardon, owned his crime, and declared his repentance of it. On the

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A Rebellion quelled, and mercy &s;hewn to the de|linquents, ever
&s;trengthens the reigning cau&s;e. How it might have been in the pre&s;ent
in&s;tance I will not pretend to determine; whether too much ri|gour might have
been exerted upon the conquered, po&s;terity mu&s;t determine; actions of this
kind are too near our own times to be either judged of, or talked of with
freedom. Immediately after the re|bellion <PB N="185" REF="188"> was
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the legi&s;lature undertook to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;everal
regulations in Scotland, which were equally conducive to the happine&s;s of the
people there, and the tranquility of the united kingdom. The Highlanders, who
had, till this time, continued to wear the old military dre&s;s of the Romans,
and who always went armed, were now reformed. Their habits were, by act of
parliament, reduced to the modern modes; the obedience they were under to their
chiefs was aboli&s;hed, and the lowe&s;t &s;ubject of that part of the kingdom
was granted a participation of Briti&s;h freedom.</P>
<P>But whatever tranquility might have been re&s;tored by the&s;e means
at home, the flames of war &s;till con|tinued to rage upon the continent with
its accu&s;tomed violence. The French went forward with rapid &s;uc|ce&s;s,
having reduced almo&s;t the whole Netherlands to their obedience. In vain the
Dutch negotiated, &s;upplicated, and evaded war; they &s;aw them&s;elves
&s;tripped of all tho&s;e &s;trong towns which defended their dominions from
inva&s;ion; and they now lay almo&s;t defencele&s;s, ready to receive terms
from their conquerors. The Dutch, at this time, were very different from their
forefathers, the brave a&s;&s;ertors of liberty, in the beginning of their
republic; the individuals of their &s;tate were rich, while the go|vernment was
poor; they had lo&s;t, in a &s;pirit of traffic and luxury, all genero&s;ity of
&s;entiment, and de&s;ire of independence; they only &s;ought riches,
re|gardle&s;s of public virtue. They were divided in their councils between two
factions which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, namely, that which declared for a
Stadtholder, and that which, with attachments to France, oppo&s;ed his
election. The prevalence of either &s;ide was almo&s;t equally fatal to
liberty; if a Stadtholder was elected, they then &s;aw their con&s;titution
altered from a re|public to a kind of limited monarchy; if the oppo|&s;ite
party prevailed, they were to feel the weight of a <PB N="186" REF="189">
confirmed ari&s;tocracy, confirmed by French power, and crouching under its
authority. Of the two e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s they
cho&s;e the former; the people, in &s;everal to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, inflamed almo&s;t to tumult and &s;edition, compelled their
magi&s;trates to declare for the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder,
Captain-general and Admiral of the United Provinces. The vigorous
con&s;equences of this re&s;olution immediately appeared; all commerce with the
French was prohibited; the Dutch army was augmented; and orders were i&s;&s;ued
to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t the French by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee this war diffu&s;ed throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem of
Europe, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embling a di&s;order, the &s;ymptoms of which,
at different times, appear in different parts of the body, remitting and raging
by turns. At the commencement of the war we have &s;een the Queen of Hungary
upon the point of lo&s;ing all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Soon after we &s;aw the
unfortunate Duke of Bavaria, who had been cho&s;en Emperor by the name of
Charles VII, bani&s;hed from his throne, &s;tripped of his hereditary dukedom,
and ever &s;hrinking from &s;urrounding dangers. We have &s;een the Duke of
Savoy, now King of Sardinia, changing that &s;ide which &s;ome years before he
e&s;pou&s;ed, and, joining with Au&s;tria and England, again&s;t the ambitious
de&s;igns of France, while Italy &s;till felt all the terrors of war, or rather
&s;aw foreigners contending with each other for her domi|nions; the French and
Spaniards on one &s;ide, the Imperiali&s;ts and the King of Sardinia on the
other. Thus Rome, that once gave laws to the world, now &s;aw the troops of
Germany and Spain, by turns, enter into her territories; and, after various
com|bats, &s;he, at la&s;t, &s;aw the Imperiali&s;ts become ma|&s;ters. The
Spaniards and French lo&s;t the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing armies, notwith&s;tanding
the excellent con|duct of the Prince of Conti their General; and, at la&s;t,
after a bloody victory obtained over the Spa|niards <PB N="187" REF="190">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> St. Lazaro, the beautiful city
of Genoa, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d &s;ided with
Spain, was obliged to &s;ubmit to the conquerors, to &s;uffer &s;ome
indignities impo&s;ed upon them, and to pay a mo&s;t &s;evere contribution.</P>
<P>The city of Genoa had, for ages before, main|tained its own laws,
and boa&s;ted of liberty. Be&s;ides its inner wall, it had another formed by a
chain of rocks of more than two leagues extent; but both being built in tho&s;e
times when modern fortification was yet unknown, it was not thought, by its
Senate, capable of making a proper re&s;i&s;tance. Upon &s;ub|mitting, the
unhappy Italians too &s;oon found that no mercy was to be expected from the
court of Vi|enna, which had ever patronized oppre&s;&s;ion. More than a million
&s;terling was demanded for a contribu|tion; a tax, the payment of which mu&s;t
have utterly ruined the city. The magi&s;trates did all in their power to pay
the exorbitant &s;um demanded; and the German troops exerci&s;ed every
inhumanity in exact|ing it. The conquerors lived upon the people, and treated
them with an in&s;olence which was natural to them as conquerors, and as
Germans. The Genoe&s;e were, at length, reduced to de&s;pair, and were
re&s;olved to make a la&s;t effort for the recovery of their liberty and
independence. The Au&s;trians took the cannon of the city, in order to
tran&s;port them to Provence, where their arms had already penetrated. The
Ge|noe&s;e them&s;elves were obliged to draw tho&s;e cannon which they had once
con&s;idered as the defence and ornament of their citadel. It was on this
occa&s;ion that an Au&s;trian officer &s;truck one of the citizens, who had
been employed in this laborious ta&s;k. This blow &s;erved to animate the
people with their former &s;pirit of freedom. They took up arms in every
quarter of the town, and &s;urprized &s;ome battalions of the Au&s;trians,
&s;urrounded others, and cut them in pieces. The Senate, uncertain how to
proceed, nei|ther encouraged nor &s;topped the citizens, who drove 
<PB N="188" REF="191"> the Au&s;trians intirely out, and then appointed
com|manders, and guarded the walls with the utmo&s;t re|gularity.</P>
<P>This revolution in a little city, the tran&s;actions of which has
filled whole Folios of hi&s;tory, &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over without
remark; though no longer capable of maintaining its liberties amid&s;t the
&s;hock of the enormous powers of Europe; yet &s;till we find it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its ancient &s;pirit; only to lo&s;e it, how|ever, by the
prevailing power of the Senate, which e&s;tabli&s;hed their ari&s;tocracy on
the necks of the citi|zens, as before.</P>
<P>In this manner we &s;ee victory and mi&s;carriage mutually declaring
for either; all &s;ides growing more feeble, and none acquiring any real
recompence for the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained. Thus, about this time, the
Engli&s;h made an un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition into France, in order to attack
Port l'Orient, in which they came off without any honour. The French gained a
con|&s;iderable victory at Rocroux in Flanders, over the allies, although it
procured them no real advantage; and it co&s;t them a greater number of lives
than tho&s;e whom they obliged to retire. The Dutch, in this general conflict,
&s;eemed the greate&s;t lo&s;ers. A vic|tory gained over the allies at La Feldt
&s;erved to re|duce them to a &s;till greater degree of di&s;tru&s;t in their
Generals, than they had hitherto &s;hewn: but the taking of Bergen-op-Zoom, the
&s;tronge&s;t fortification of Dutch Brabant, and which put the French in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole navigation of the Schelde, threw them almo&s;t
into de&s;pair. But the&s;e victories, in favour of France, were
counterbalanced with al|mo&s;t equal di&s;appointments. In Italy, the French
General, Mar&s;hal Belli&s;le's brother, at the head of thirty-four thou&s;and
men, attempted to penetrate into Piedmont; but his troops were put to the
route, and he him&s;elf &s;lain. The French King equipped an un|&s;ucce&s;sful
armament for the recovery of Cape Bre|ton; <PB N="189" REF="192"> and, not
di&s;couraged by this failure, fitted out two &s;quadrons, one to make a
de&s;cent upon the Bri|ti&s;h Colonies in America, and the other to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations in the Ea&s;t Indies. The&s;e, however, were
attacked by An&s;on and Warren, and nine of their &s;hips were taken. Soon
after this Commodore Fox, with &s;ix &s;hips of war, took above forty French
&s;hips laden from St. Domingo; and this lo&s;s was &s;oon after followed by
another defeat, which the French fleet &s;u&s;tained from Admiral Hawke, in
which &s;even &s;hips of the line, and &s;everal frigates, were taken.</P>
<P>This variety of &s;ucce&s;s &s;erved to make all the powers at war
heartily de&s;irous of a peace. The States-General had, for &s;ome years,
endeavoured to &s;top the progre&s;s of a war, in which they could gain no
advantages, and had all to lo&s;e. The King of France was &s;en&s;ible, that,
after a victory, was the mo&s;t advantageous opportunity of propo&s;ing terms
of peace; and even expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of general tran|quility, in a
per&s;onal conver&s;ation with Sir John Li|gonier, who had been made pri&s;oner
in the la&s;t victory obtained by the French at La Feldt. The bad &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his admirals at &s;ea, his Generals misfortunes in Italy, the frequent
bankruptcies of his &s;ubjects, the election of a Stadtholder in Holland, who
oppo&s;ed his intere&s;ts, his views in Germany intirely fru&s;trated by the
elevation of the Duke of Tu&s;cany to rule the Empire; all the&s;e contributed
to make him weary of the war. An accommodation was therefore agreed upon; and
the contending powers agreed to a con|gre&s;s at Aix la Chapelle, where the
Earl of Sand|wich and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted as
plenipo|tentiaries from the King of Great Britain. The treaty which takes its
name from that city, was con|cluded on the &s;eventh day of October, a
la&s;ting in|&s;tance of precipitate coun&s;els and Engli&s;h humility. By this
it was agreed, that all pri&s;oners, on each
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, &s;hould be mutually
re&s;tored, and all conque&s;ts <PB N="190" REF="193"> given up. That the
Duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be ceded to Don Philip,
heir apparent to the Spani&s;h throne, and his heirs; but in ca&s;e of his
&s;ucceeding to the crown of Spain, that then the&s;e dominions &s;hould revert
to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. That the fortifications of Dunkirk to the &s;ea
&s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that the &s;hip annually &s;ent with &s;laves to the
coa&s;t of Spain, &s;hould have this privilege continued for four years; that
the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be

<P>THIS peace might, in every re&s;pect, be termed only a temporary
ce&s;&s;ation from general ho&s;ti|lities; though the war between England and
France had actually &s;ub&s;ided in Europe, yet in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies
they &s;till carried on ho&s;tile operations, both &s;ides equally culpable,
yet each complaining of the infraction.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as Europe enjoyed a temporary tranquility, the
people of England expected, and the government promi&s;ed them, a re&s;titution
of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which had been taken from them by a long and
ob&s;tinate war. A magnificent firework was played off upon this occa&s;ion;
which, though an u&s;e|le&s;s and vain expence, &s;erved to amu&s;e the
populace, and render them more contented with the late pre|carious treaty.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try al&s;o &s;hewed &s;ome de&s;ire to promote the
commerce of the kingdom; and, for this pur|po&s;e, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed for
encouraging a Briti&s;h her|ring fi&s;hery, under proper regulations. From
&s;uch a &s;cheme carried into execution, great advantages were expected to
accrue; the Dutch, who had long en|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oyed the &s;ole profits ari&s;ing from it, con&s;idered the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ea as a mine of inexhau&s;tible
wealth. However, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">xperience has
&s;hewn that the Engli&s;h were either
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ncapable of turning this fi&s;hery
to the &s;ame ad|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">antage, or that

Private per&s;ons have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ften been

<P>A &s;cheme, which, by many, was thought &s;till mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> advantageous to the nation, was, the

become members of a new colony in North America<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> called Nova Scotia. To this retreat, it was thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wa&s;te of an exuberant nation
might well be drain+ed off; and here tho&s;e free &s;pirits might be kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> employed, who, if &s;uffered to remain
at home, would only prey upon the community. This was a cold climate, and a
barren &s;oil, where the Engli&s;h had a fort, and a &s;mall garri&s;on, rather
to intimidate the neighbouring French, and repre&s;s their incroach|ments, than
to derive any advantages from the im|provement of trade, or the cultivation of
the coun|try. It was here that a &s;cheme was laid for the foundation of a new
colony, which might improve the fi&s;hery upon that coa&s;t, and become a new
&s;ource of wealth to the mother country. Thus did the nation exchange her
hardy and veteran troops for the expectation of precarious wealth. Every colony
taken from the parent country &s;erves to le&s;&s;en its &s;trength; and all
the wealth imported into it, after it has be|come moderately rich, being only
u&s;ed as the in&s;tru|ment of luxury, in&s;tead of invigorating the nation,
tends to render it more effeminate.</P>
<P>However, it was adverti&s;ed by authority, that all proper
encouragement would be given to &s;uch officers and private men, who, being
di&s;charged from the &s;ervice of the government, &s;hould be willing to
&s;et|tle in Nova Scotia. Fifty acres of land were granted to every private
&s;oldier or &s;eaman, free from taxes for ten years, and then to pay only one
&s;hilling a year. Be&s;ides this fifty, ten acres more were to be granted to
every individual of which each family &s;hould con&s;i&s;t. Every officer,
under the rank of en|&s;ign, was to have four&s;core acres; en&s;igns were to 
<PB N="193" REF="196"> have two hundred, lieutenants three, captains four, and
tho&s;e above that rank &s;ix. Such offers failed not to induce numbers to try
their fortunes on that de&s;olate coa&s;t; and, in a little time, about four
thou|&s;and adventurers, with their families, were carried thither; a town
named Halifax was built; and the coloni&s;ts left to glean a &s;canty
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance from an ungrateful &s;oil. Since that time, notwith&s;tanding
all the encouragement this colony has received from the government, the
inhabitants have cleared but a very &s;mall part of the woods with which the
face of the country is covered. Agriculture is quite for&s;aken; and the
&s;ettlement intirely &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the &s;ums ex|pended by the army and
navy &s;tationed in this part of the we&s;tern world.</P>
<P>Here tho&s;e voluntary out-ca&s;ts of their country expected to
live, though hardly, yet at lea&s;t &s;ecurely; but, in this they found
them&s;elves di&s;appointed. The Indians, a &s;avage and fierce people, from
the fir&s;t looked upon the&s;e &s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h as an
in|croachment upon their own liberties; and the French, who were equally
jealous, fomented the&s;e outrages. Commi&s;&s;aries were therefore appointed
to meet at Paris, and compromi&s;e the&s;e di&s;putes; but the&s;e con|ferences
were rendered abortive by mutual cavillings, and all the arts of eva&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Pelham, who chiefly con|ducted the bu&s;ine&s;s
of the &s;tate, and was e&s;teemed a man of candour and capacity, laid a
&s;cheme for lightening the immen&s;e load of debt that was laid upon the
nation. His plan was to le&s;&s;en the national incumbrance, by lowering the
intere&s;t which had been promi&s;ed upon the fir&s;t rai&s;ing the &s;upply,
or obliging the lenders to receive the &s;ums originally granted. Tho&s;e who
were proprietors of &s;tocks, and received, for the u&s;e of their money, four

<P>But all the advantages the nation reaped from the&s;e &s;alutary
mea&s;ures, were not &s;ufficient to counter-balance the &s;troke which liberty
received (as &s;ome are of opinion) by an unu&s;ual &s;tretch of the privileges
of the hou&s;e of commons. As this is a point which de&s;erves the
&s;tricte&s;t attention, permit me to trace it up to the &s;ource. The city of
We&s;tmin&s;ter had long been repre&s;ented by members who were nominated, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, by the mini&s;try; Lord Trentham having vacated his &s;eat in
the hou&s;e, by accepting a place under the crown, he again declared him&s;elf
a candidate; but met with violent oppo&s;ition. It was objected to him by
&s;ome, that he had been uncom|monly active in introducing &s;ome French
&s;trollers, who had come over to exhibit plays upon the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of
our own. This accu&s;ation, whether true or fal&s;e, excited numbers again&s;t
him, who &s;tyled them&s;elves the <HI>independent electors of
We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and named Sir George Vandeput, a private gentleman, as
his competitor. The oppo&s;ition re&s;olved to &s;up|port their candidate at
their own expence. They accordingly opened hou&s;es of entertainment,
&s;olicited votes, and propagated abu&s;e as u&s;ual. At length, 
<PB N="195" REF="198"> the poll being clo&s;ed, the majority appeared in favour
of Lord Trentham; a &s;crutiny was demanded by the other &s;ide; it was
protracted by the ob&s;tinacy of both parties; but this al&s;o turning out in
favour of Lord Trentham, the independent electors petitioned the hou&s;e,
complaining of an undue election, and of partiality and inju&s;tice in the
high-bailiff of We&s;t|min&s;ter, who took the poll. To this petition the
hou&s;e paid little regard, but proceeded to examine the high-bailiff as to the
cau&s;es that had &s;o long pro|tracted the election; who laid the blame upon
Mr. Crowle, who had acted as council for the petitioners, on the honourable
Alexander Murray, and one Gib|&s;on an uphol&s;terer. The&s;e three per&s;ons
were there|fore brought to the bar of the hou&s;e; Crowle and Gib&s;on, after
having a&s;ked pardon upon their knees, and, being reprimanded by the hou&s;e,
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Murray was fir&s;t admitted to bail; but, after &s;ome
witne&s;&s;es had depo&s;ed, that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters,
it was voted that he &s;hould be committed a clo&s;e pri&s;oner to Newgate;
and, to in|vigorate their mea&s;ures, that he &s;hould receive this &s;entence
at the bar of the hou&s;e on his knees. He accordingly appeared; but being
directed by the Speaker to kneel, refu&s;ed to comply. This refu&s;al threw the
whole hou&s;e into a commotion; and it was ordered that he &s;hould be
committed clo&s;e pri|&s;oner to Newgate, debarred the u&s;e of pen, ink, and
paper, and that no per&s;on &s;hould have acce&s;s to him without
permi&s;&s;ion from the hou&s;e. This impri&s;on|ment he underwent,
&s;en&s;ible that it could continue no longer than while they continued to
&s;it; and, at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he was conducted from
pri|&s;on to his own hou&s;e, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. He now
was thought, by many, intirely free from all farther pro&s;ecution; but, in
this, they were mi&s;taken; for, at the opening of the en&s;uing &s;itting of
parliament, a motion was made, that Mr. <PB N="196" REF="199"> Murray &s;hould
be again committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower. Hitherto it was
&s;uppo&s;ed by &s;everal, that the hou&s;e of commons had acted with a
&s;pirit of re&s;entment. Now it was thought, that they made an attempt at
extending their privileges. Though the delinquent, a per&s;on of no great
con&s;equence in him&s;elf, had taken the prudent precautions of re|tiring from
their re&s;entment, yet &s;everal of the people &s;aw that the hou&s;e
con&s;idered it&s;elf rather as a body di&s;tinct from the people, than the
guardians of the people; and, in&s;tead of maintaining the liber|ties of the
&s;ubject in general, attempted to increa&s;e their own. Some thought they
&s;aw, in this mea|&s;ure, the &s;eeds of future ari&s;tocracy; that the
hou&s;e of commons con&s;tituted them&s;elves judges of their own privileges;
and that the liberty of every indi|vidual in &s;ociety was at the di&s;po&s;al
of a body who profe&s;&s;ed acting chiefly for their own honour.</P>
<P>However this may be, another mea&s;ure was &s;oon after taken,
which, in reality, made di&s;tinctions among the people, and laid an
unpa&s;&s;able line be|tween the rich and poor. This was an act for the better
preventing clande&s;tine marriages, and for the more public &s;olemnization of
that ceremony. The grievance complained of, and which this law was to
redre&s;s, was, that the &s;ons and daughters of opulent families were often
&s;educed into marriage, before they had acquired &s;ufficient experience in
life to be &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;parity of fortune in the match. This
&s;tatute therefore enacted, that the bans of mar|riage &s;hould be regularly
publi&s;hed three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sundays in the church of the pari&s;h where
both par|ties had re&s;ided for one month at lea&s;t, before the ceremony. That
a marriage which was &s;olemnized without this previous publication, or a
licen&s;e ob|tained from the Bi&s;hop's Court, &s;hould be void, and the
per&s;on who &s;olemnized it &s;hould be tran&s;ported for &s;even years. This
act was, at that time, thought <PB N="197" REF="200"> replete with
con&s;equences injurious to &s;ociety; and experience has manife&s;ted &s;ome
of them; villains have gone about deceiving ignorant women, under a pretence of
marriage, and then have left them without redre&s;s. The poor were thus
rendered ut|terly incapable of making alliances with the rich; and the wealth
of the nation has thus been more li|able to accumulation in opulent families.
It has been thought to impede that ardour which impels many to marry; and to
clog a ceremony of the mo&s;t infinite advantage to &s;ociety, with
procra&s;tination and delay. Some have affirmed, that debaucheries and
lewdne&s;s have become more frequent &s;ince the enact|ing this law; and it is
believed, that the numbers of the people are upon the decline.</P>
<P>This &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by
another act equally unpopular, and, perhaps, equally injurious to the religion
of the community. This was a law for naturalizing the Jews. The mini&s;ters
boldly affirmed, that &s;uch a law would greatly contribute to the advantage of
the nation; that it would increa&s;e the credit and commerce of the kingdom,
and &s;et a laudable example of political toleration. Many others, however,
were of very different &s;entiments; they &s;aw that greater favour was
&s;hewn, by this bill, to Jews, than to &s;ome other &s;ects profe&s;&s;ing the
Chri&s;tian religion; that an intro|duction of this people into the kingdom
would di&s;|grace the character of the nation, and cool the zeal of the natives
already too lukewarm. However, not|with&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition, this bill
was pa&s;&s;ed into a law; nor was it till the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parlia|ment, that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to be repealed.</P>
<P>An act, equally unpopular with the two former, was now al&s;o
pa&s;&s;ed, which contained regulations for the better pre&s;erving the game.
By this none but men already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;tated fortune, had a
pri|vilege of carrying a gun, or de&s;troying game, though 
<PB N="198" REF="201"> even upon the grounds which he him&s;elf rented. This
totally damped all that martial &s;pirit among the lower orders of mankind, by
preventing their hand|ling tho&s;e arms which might one day be nece&s;&s;ary to
defend their country; and gave the rich the &s;ole in|joyment of a plea&s;ure,
which, before, had been con|&s;idered as the common privilege of humanity. Such
were the laws pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion; through all which a &s;pirit of
ari&s;tocracy was di&s;cerned by &s;ome. The body of the rich no longer fearing
oppre&s;&s;ion from the throne, or an infringement of their own liberties, now
began to lean heavy upon the poor, and to con|&s;ider the intere&s;ts of that
u&s;eful part of &s;ociety, as in|tirely di&s;tinct from their own. They never
omitted, however, the u&s;ual addre&s;&s;es to the throne; and this
&s;e&s;&s;ion was remarkable for an addre&s;s of thanks to his Maje&s;ty for
maintaining, and rendering perma|nent, the general tranquility of Europe, at a
time when war was kindling in almo&s;t every quarter of the world.</P>

<P>IF we &s;eek for the origin of that war which now threatened
univer&s;al deva&s;tation, we &s;hall find it kindling up in &s;everal
countries, both of Europe, America, and A&s;ia, at one and the &s;ame time.
Mo&s;t other national conte&s;ts have ari&s;en from &s;ome one principal
cau&s;e; but this war &s;eems to have been pro|duced by the concurrence of
&s;everal, or it may be con&s;idered as the continuance of the late war, which
had not been effectually extingui&s;hed by the defective treaty of Aix la
Chapelle.</P>
<P>In A&s;ia, upon the coa&s;t of Malabar, the Engli&s;h and French had
never cea&s;ed ho&s;tilities. The claim <PB N="199" REF="202"> of Pru&s;&s;ia
and Au&s;tria, upon the territories of Sile&s;ia, had never been thoroughly
adju&s;ted. The limits of Nova Scotia, inhabited by the Engli&s;h, and bordered
upon by the French, were never preci&s;ely determin|ed; and, &s;outhward, the
boundaries of Acadia, an extended country belonging to the French, and
bor|dering upon Virginia, were equally left uncertain. Negotiations had long
been carried on to determine the&s;e differences; but what could rea&s;on do in
deter|mining di&s;putes in which there were no certain prin|ciples to be guided
by? The limits of the&s;e countries had never been &s;ettled; for they were,
before this time, thought too remote, or too in&s;ignificant, to employ much
attention. And it was not probable that powers who had no other right to the
countries in di&s;pute, but that of inva&s;ion, would have equity enough to
agree upon &s;haring the &s;poil.</P>
<P>The right which any of the contending powers pretended to, might, in
the eye of rea&s;on, be thought very controvertible; but the convenience which
either party was to derive from the enjoyment of their pecu|liar claims was not
&s;o uncertain. As the di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;eemed to begin in North America, we
mu&s;t turn to that country to con&s;ider their ri&s;e. The French had been the
fir&s;t cultivators of Nova Scotia, and, by great indu&s;try and long
per&s;everance, rendered the &s;oil, na|turally barren, &s;omewhat fertile, and
capable of &s;u|&s;taining nature with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
Europe. This country, however, had frequently changed ma|&s;ters, until the
Engli&s;h were acknowledged as the rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors by the treaty of
Utrecht. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country, in any other nation, would
expo&s;e our colonies to perpetual inva&s;ion, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in
acquiring a &s;uperiority in commerce, and the northern fi&s;heries. It has
been already ob|&s;erved, that we had an infant colony upon that coa&s;t, which
was chiefly &s;upported by royal bounty, and &s;truggled with all the
di&s;advantages of the &s;evere cli|mate, <PB N="200" REF="203"> and the
ungrateful &s;oil. But it had an ob+&s;truction to its growth &s;till more
formidable than ei|ther. The French, who had been long &s;ettled in the back
parts of the country, continually &s;pirited up the Indians to repel the new
comers; &s;o that &s;ome of them were actually murdered, or &s;old to the
French at Loui&s;burg. The&s;e violations were complained of, and complaint
produced recrimination; &s;o that the two powers of France and England were
negotiating with, accu&s;ing, and de&s;troying each other all at one time.</P>
<P>Now al&s;o began to be ob&s;erved another &s;ource of di&s;pute,
which promi&s;ed as much unea&s;ine&s;s as the former. The French, pretending
fir&s;t to have di&s;|covered the mouth of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,
claimed the whole adjacent country towards New Mexico on the ea&s;t, quite to
the Apalachian Mountains on the we&s;t. And finding &s;everal Engli&s;hmen, who
had &s;ettled be|yond the&s;e mountains, both from motives of com|merce, and
invited by the natural beauties of the country, they drove them away, and built
&s;uch forts as could command the whole country around. It was now, therefore,
&s;een, that their intentions were to &s;urround the Engli&s;h colonies which
lay along the &s;hore, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the internal parts of
the country that lay on the back of our &s;ettlements; and being already
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the northern and &s;outhern &s;hores, thus inclo&s;e to us
on every &s;ide, and &s;ecure to them&s;elves all trade with the natives of the
country. The Engli&s;h therefore ju&s;tly apprehended, that if the French were
able to unite their northern colonies, which were traded into by the river St.
Lawrence, to their &s;outhern, which were acce&s;&s;ible by the river
Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, they mu&s;t, in time, become ma&s;|ters of the whole
territory; and, by having a wide country to increa&s;e in, would &s;oon
multiply, and be|come every year more dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204"> The government of England having long
com|plained of the&s;e incroachments, determined, at length, to repel force by
force, and to cut the knot of nego|tiation, which they could not untie. Orders
were di&s;patched to the governors of the provinces to unite into a confederacy
for their mutual &s;ecurity; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Indians over to
their cau&s;e. The Indians were a fierce &s;avage people, unacquaint|ed with
the arts, but from infancy trained to the practice of war. It had long been the
method of the Engli&s;h to cultivate their friend&s;hip in times of danger, but
to &s;light their alliance in circum&s;tances of tranquility; this, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, &s;erved to alie|nate their affections from our government; but the
fraud and avarice of our merchants, particularly that called the <HI>Ohio
company,</HI> who &s;old them bad merchan|dizes, and treated them with equal
in&s;olence and perfidy, &s;erved to confirm their aver&s;ion. Be&s;ides, there
was &s;omething in the di&s;po&s;ition of the French &s;ettlers in the&s;e
regions more &s;imilar to theirs; the French, like the natives, were hardy,
enterpri&s;ing, and poor; they naturally therefore joined with tho&s;e al|lies,
from conquering of whom they could expect no plunder; and declared again&s;t
the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts, who were rich, frugal, and laborious, and who&s;e
&s;poils they con&s;equently were the more de&s;irous to &s;hare.</P>
<P>Thus then the Engli&s;h had not only the French, but almo&s;t the
whole body of the Indian nations to oppo&s;e; yet this confederacy again&s;t
them did not give a greater union to the different provinces, who&s;e
in|tere&s;t it was to oppo&s;e. Some of the provinces, who, from their
&s;ituation, had little to fear from the enemy, or little advantages to expect
from victory, declined furni&s;hing their &s;hare of the &s;upplies, the
governors of &s;ome other colonies, who had been men of broken fortunes, and
had come from their native country to retrieve them by acts of rapacity and
oppre&s;&s;ion <PB N="202" REF="205"> here, were &s;o much dreaded, or hated,
that they lo&s;t all influence in in&s;piring the coloni&s;ts with a proper
&s;pirit of defence. The mini&s;try, however, at home, began to exert it&s;elf
for their defence, and their mea|&s;ures were ha&s;tened by ho&s;tilities
already commenced, there having been, for &s;ome time, a &s;kirmi&s;hing
be|tween General Lawrence to the north, and Colonel Wa&s;hington to the
&s;outh, with parties of the French, in which the latter were victorious. It
would be tedious, as well as uninforming, to relate all the preparations that
now began to be made by either party; or to load this account with barbarous
names and unimportant marches; or to recount the alter|nate victories and
defeats of either &s;ide; be it &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve, that they &s;eemed,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to have imbibed the ferocity of manners of the &s;a|vage
people, with whom they fought, and exerci&s;ed various cruelties, either from a
&s;pirit of repri&s;al or revenge.</P>
<P>Four operations were undertaken by the Engli&s;h at the &s;ame time;
one commanded by Colonel Monck|ton, to drive the French from the incroachments
they had made upon the province of Nova Scotia; ano|ther to the &s;outh,
again&s;t Crown Point, under the command of General John&s;on; a third
commanded by General Shirley, again&s;t Niagara; and a fourth, &s;till farther
to the &s;outh, again&s;t Du Que&s;ne, under the conduct of General Braddock.
In the&s;e re&s;pec|tive expeditions Monckton was &s;ucce&s;sful; John&s;on
victorious, though without effect; Shirley was thought dilatory, and his
expedition deferred to another &s;ea|&s;on! but the fortunes of Braddock are
&s;o extraordi|nary as to require a more ample detail. This Ge|neral was
recommended to this &s;ervice by the Duke of Cumberland, who was ju&s;tly
&s;en&s;ible of his cou|rage, and knowledge in the art of war. The&s;e two
advantages, however, which, upon other occa|&s;ions, are thought the highe&s;t
requi&s;ites of a Ge|neral <PB N="203" REF="206"> were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
conducive to this com|mander's overthrow. His courage made him ob&s;ti|nate;
and his &s;kill in war was improper to be ex|erted in a country where there
were no regular ad|vances to be made, nor a mar&s;halled enemy to en|counter.
This brave but unfortunate man &s;et for|ward upon the expedition in June, and
left Fort Cumberland on the tenth, at the head of two thou|&s;and two hundred
men, directing his march to that part of the country where General Wa&s;hington
had been defeated the year before. Upon his arrival there he was informed, that
the French at fort Du Que&s;ne expected a reinforcement of five hundred men; he
therefore re&s;olved, with all ha&s;te, to advance, and attack them, before
they became too powerful by this a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Leaving, therefore, Colonel
Dun|bar, with eight hundred men, to bring up the provi|&s;ions, &s;tores, and
heavy baggage, as fa&s;t as the nature of the &s;ervice would permit, he
marched forward with the re&s;t of his army through a country equally
dan|gerous from its fore&s;ts and &s;avage inhabitants; a country where
Europeans had never before attempted to penetrate, wild, &s;olitary, and
hideous. Still, how|ever, he went forward with intrepidity, through the
de&s;arts of O&s;wego, regardle&s;s of the enemy's attempts, taking no care
previou&s;ly to explore the woods or thickets, as if the nearer he approached
the enemy, the le&s;s regardle&s;s he was of danger. At length, on the eighth
of July, he encamped within ten miles of the fort Du Que&s;ne, which he
intended to attack, and the next day re&s;umed his march, without &s;o much as
endeavouring to get intelligence of an enemy he de|&s;pi&s;ed. With this
confidence he was marching forward; his &s;oldiers promi&s;ed them&s;elves a
&s;peedy ce&s;&s;ation from their harra&s;&s;ing march, and all things &s;eemed
to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, when the whole army was at once a&s;toni&s;hed by a
general di&s;charge of arms, from an un&s;een ene|my, <PB N="204" REF="207">
along the front and left flank. It was now too late to think of retreating; his
whole body had pa&s;&s;ed into the defile, which the enemy had artfully
permit|ted before they attempted to fire. His van guard therefore fell back, in
con&s;ternation, upon the main body; and the pannic &s;oon became general. The
officers alone di&s;dained to fly, while Braddock him&s;elf, at their head,
di&s;covered the greate&s;t intrepidity, and the highe&s;t imprudence; he never
thought of retreat|ing, but ob&s;tinately continued on the &s;pot where he was,
and gave orders to the few brave men who &s;ur|rounded him, to form according
to the rules of war, and regularly advance again&s;t the enemy. An
en|thu&s;ia&s;t to the di&s;cipline of the field, he de&s;ired to bring the
&s;pirit of a German campaign into the wilds of Niagara. In the mean time, his
officers fell thick about him, while he &s;till continued to i&s;&s;ue out
or|ders with compo&s;ure, though he had five hor&s;es &s;hot under him, and
though the whole body of his troops was fled. At length he received a
mu&s;ket-&s;hot through the lungs, he dropped, and a total confu&s;ion
en&s;ued. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, of the army, were left to
the enemy; the General's cabinet of letters al&s;o &s;hared the &s;ame fate;
and the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h, in this unhappy &s;urprize, amount|ed to
&s;even hundred men; and the remainder of the army, &s;ome time after, returned
to Philadelphia. It was in this manner the expedition of General Brad|dock
terminated; from which England had expected &s;uch advantages. In all actions,
that excite the ap|plau&s;e and admiration of mankind, a part of their
&s;uc|ce&s;s is owing to conduct, and a part to fortune. Of the latter Braddock
was totally for&s;aken; he was un&s;ucce&s;sful; and the ungrateful world are
unwilling to grant him the former.</P>
<P>Thus unfortunate were the beginnings of this war, with regard to
England; it was re&s;olved therefore, that no mea&s;ures were now to be
pre&s;erved with the <PB N="205" REF="208"> French; and orders were given to
take their &s;hips wherever found, though there was yet no formal de|claration
of war. With this order the naval com|manders very readily and willingly
complied, &s;o that &s;oon the Engli&s;h ports were filled with &s;hips taken
from the enemy, and kept as an indemnification for the&s;e forts which the
enemy had unju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of in America. The French
complained loudly again&s;t the inju&s;tice of this proceeding; they
repre&s;ented it to the re&s;t of Europe, as a breach of that faith which
&s;hould be ob&s;erved among nations, as a piratical mea&s;ure, di&s;graceful
to the mo&s;t &s;avage nation. Their memorials were an&s;wered by the
Engli&s;h, with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on. However, it mu&s;t be owned, that as
a declaration of war was a ceremony ea&s;ily performed, it would have been more
con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of the mini&s;try, to have pur&s;ued the u&s;ual
methods of conte&s;t which had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe. The truth
is, that the mini&s;try were now divided between peace and war; they &s;aw the
nece&s;&s;ity of vigorous mea&s;ures, but they were afraid to throw off the
ma&s;k of peace intirely. Henry Pelham, who had long guided at the helm of
affairs with candour and capacity, had for &s;ome time been dead, and his place
&s;upplied by Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, who, though a &s;en&s;ible mini&s;ter, and
a favourite of the King, was of no great weight in council, and,
con&s;equently, &s;oon under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;igning; and Mr. Fox was
put in his place. The admini&s;tration was al&s;o new formed, in other
re&s;pects, by the taking in &s;everal other new mem|bers. Tho&s;e who had long
been in the mini&s;try, were, it is thought, for peace; tho&s;e, on the
contrary, who were newly taken into the direction of affairs, ex|pected to
&s;upplant their rivals by an oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem, and were con&s;equently
for war. The leader of this party, therefore, warmly &s;olicited for war,
&s;econded by the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, and the general voice of 
<PB N="206" REF="209"> the people, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him expected to effect
by negotiation whatever arms could atchieve. Whatever might have been the
motives for protract|ing the declaration, the French &s;eemed to convince
Europe of their moderation upon this attack by &s;ea, by neither declaring war,
nor making any repri&s;als by &s;ea. However, they threatened England with a
formidable inva&s;ion; &s;everal bodies of troops moved to the coa&s;ts
adjacent to ours; their mini&s;ters threat|ened loudly in foreign courts; and
&s;uch preparations were made as &s;hewed a re&s;olution of carrying the war
into the heart of Great Britain. The&s;e prepa|rations had the de&s;ired
effect, filling the nation with con&s;ternation, turbulence, and clamour. The
people &s;aw them&s;elves expo&s;ed without arms, leaders, or di&s;|cipline,
while the mini&s;try were timid, unpopular, and wavering. In this &s;ituation
the Dutch were applied to for &s;ix thou&s;and men, which, by treaty, they were
to &s;end England, in ca&s;e of its being threatened with an inva&s;ion. Which
demand, how|ever, by affected delays, was put off &s;o long, that the King,
unwilling to come to an open rupture with the republic, de&s;i&s;ted from it;
for which they return|ed his Maje&s;ty thanks. Such are the advantages England
is to expect, by relying on a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any other quarter than its
native &s;trength and una|nimity; and every day &s;eems to convince us of the
ab&s;urdity of political alliances, which are never ob|&s;erved, as wanting
friend&s;hip to bind, or force to compel.</P>
<P>In this timid &s;ituation the mini&s;try were eager to catch at any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a body therefore of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians, amounting
to about ten thou&s;and, were brought over to protect about as many millions of
Engli&s;hmen, who, with &s;words in their hands, were able to defend
them&s;elves; but &s;uch was the vile complexion of this period, that the whole
king|dom pre&s;ented nothing but one picture of di&s;content, 
<PB N="207" REF="210"> terror, and di&s;tru&s;t of their leaders. The
mini&s;try was execrated for having reduced the nation to &s;uch
circum&s;tances of di&s;grace, as to be thought to &s;tand in need of
pre&s;ervation from a few German merce|naries; but what could be expected from
&s;uch a mi|ni&s;try, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither of the arts, nor the
integrity of government.</P>
<P>However, the French were by no means &s;erious in this intended
de&s;cent; the only de&s;ign was to draw off the attention of the Engli&s;h
mini&s;try from an ex|pedition which was actually going forward again&s;t
Minorca, an i&s;land in the Mediterranean, which we had formerly taken from
Spain, and had been &s;ecured to us by repeated treaties. But the mini&s;try of
Eng|land were too much infected with the more dome&s;tic terror, to take
&s;ufficient precautions to guard this place, though they had early notice of
the enemies intentions. In&s;tead therefore of &s;ufficiently guard|ing the
i&s;land with a proper garri&s;on in St. Philip's ca&s;tle, the citadel, or of
detaching a &s;quadron that, in all re&s;pects, &s;hould be &s;uperior to the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, they only &s;ent ten men of war upon this
&s;ervice, poorly manned, and indifferently provided, under the command of
Admiral Byng, who&s;e character in the navy was by no means e&s;tabli&s;hed,
and orders to reinforce the garri&s;on of St. Philip's with one battalion from
Gibraltar; with which command, however, the governor of that place thought it
un|&s;afe to comply.</P>
<P>The Admiral &s;ent upon this &s;ervice reinforced his fleet by a
detachment of men at Gibraltar; and, &s;ail|ing towards Minorca, was joined in
the way by ano|ther man of war, from whom he learned that Minorca was actually
be&s;ieged, and the French fleet de&s;tined to &s;upport the operations by
land. He &s;oon knew the reality of this information, when, approaching the
i&s;land, he &s;aw the French banners di&s;played, and the batteries opened
upon the ca&s;tle of St. Philip's, <PB N="208" REF="211"> which &s;till
di&s;played the Engli&s;h flag. The appear|ance of the French fleet, &s;oon
after, &s;till more &s;trong|ly engaged his attention; he drew up his &s;hips
in line of battle, and determined to act upon the de|fen&s;ive. Byng had been
formerly thought to be emi|nent in naval operations, to which he was early
bred, but he had hitherto exhibited no proofs of courage. Men are generally
mo&s;t apt to pride them&s;elves upon tho&s;e talents for which they are mo&s;t
prai&s;ed; and this was the ca&s;e with this unfortunate commander; he
&s;acrificed his reputation for courage, to the hopes of being applauded for
his conduct. The French fleet advanced; a part of the Engli&s;h fleet engaged;
the Admiral &s;till kept aloof, giving prudent rea&s;ons for his
remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in coming to action; till, at length, the French Admiral,
taking the advantage of the Engli&s;hman's he&s;itation, &s;ailed &s;lowly away
to join the van of his fleet, which had been already di&s;comfited. The
Engli&s;h, for a while, continued the pur&s;uit; but the opportunity of coming
to a clo&s;e engage|ment was now lo&s;t, and never pre&s;ented it&s;elf
again.</P>
<P>Byng was &s;till re&s;olved to act with his u&s;ual cau|tion; he
called a council of war, wherein it was re|pre&s;ented that he was much
inferior to the enemy in &s;hips and men; that the relief of Minorca was
im|practicable; and that it was mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;ail back to
Gibraltar, which might require immediate protection. This repre&s;entation was
almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly agreed to, and put accordingly in execution. His
pu&s;illanimous conduct, however, &s;oon reached his native country, where it
excited almo&s;t a phrenzy of re&s;entment. The mini&s;try were al&s;o thought
to fan the flame, which &s;erved to turn the public eye from their own
mi&s;conduct in &s;ending &s;o weak an armament. Byng, in the mean time,
remained at Gibraltar, no way &s;u&s;pecting the &s;torm that was ga|thering
over his head; but talked, and wrote, even as if he expected the thanks of his
King, and the <PB N="209" REF="212"> applau&s;e of his countrymen; but he was
&s;oon awaked from this dream of infatuation, by a letter from the mini&s;try,
giving him notice, that he was recalled; and another &s;oon after, by which
directions were given that he &s;hould be &s;ent home under arre&s;t; and, upon
his arrival in England, he was committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner in Greenwich
ho&s;pital. Numberle&s;s arts were u&s;ed to inflame the populace again&s;t
this unhappy man; and, long before his tryal, &s;everal addre&s;&s;es were
&s;ent up, from different counties, crying out for ju&s;tice again&s;t the
delinquent. The indu&s;try of his friends, however, was not remi&s;s upon this
occa&s;ion; they expo&s;tulated with the multitude, and attempted to divert the
whole of univer&s;al hatred upon the mi|ni&s;try, who, at wor&s;t, only
de&s;erved a &s;hare. But, &s;oon after the news of the &s;urrender of fort St.
Phi|lip to the French inflamed the people beyond all mea|&s;ure. This
fortre&s;s had been reckoned, next to Gi|braltar, the &s;tronge&s;t in Europe,
the works having been planned by the celebrated Vauban; and, both from the
nature of the &s;oil, which was one &s;olid rock, and the peculiarity of the
&s;ituation, it was thought al|mo&s;t impregnable. In order to make
them&s;elves ma|&s;ters of this important fortre&s;s; the French, under the
command of the Duke de Richelieu, had landed near twenty thou&s;and men, which,
by continual a&s;&s;ault, and having, at length, gained an outwork, made
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place. The Engli&s;h gover|nor, General Blakeney,
however, had very honour|able terms of capitulation, and marched out with all
the en&s;igns of war. Yet, perhaps, in truth, the harder the conditions a
garri&s;on is obliged to accept, the more honourable to the commander, as they
de|note his extremity in being reduced to accept of them.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h now &s;aw them&s;elves every-where de|feated; in
America their armies were cut in pieces; in Europe their garri&s;ons taken, the
people trembling <PB N="210" REF="213"> under the dread of an inva&s;ion, a few

though it was now but a denun+ciation after having &s;truck the blow. The
Hanove+rians were &s;ent back to their own country, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> preparations were made for trying Admiral Byng i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the u&s;ual form. On the twenty-eighth
day of De|cember his tryal began before a Court-Martial, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the harbour of Port&s;mouth, where, after a &s;crutiny
of &s;everal days, his Judges came to a re&s;olution, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had not done his utmo&s;t, during the engagement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to de&s;troy the enemy, which it was
his duty to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> engaged. They
therefore unanimou&s;ly were of opi+nion, that he fell under the twelfth
article of war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> which po&s;itively
ordered death to any per&s;on, who in the time of action &s;hould withdraw,

or who &s;hould not do his ut|mo&s;t, through either motives of cowardice,
negli|gence, or di&s;affection. He was therefore adjudge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be &s;hot on board &s;uch &s;hip as the Lords of
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Admiralty &s;hould plea&s;e to

&s;ame time, recommended him to mercy; as they could not tell the motives of
his keeping aloof. By &s;uch a &s;entence they expected to have &s;atisfied the
national animo&s;ity again&s;t him, and yet to &s;creen them&s;elves from the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;everity. What|ever the government might wi&s;h to do
is uncertain; but the cry of vengeance was too loud to be di&s;re|garded! his
Maje&s;ty therefore referred the &s;entence to the twelve Judges, who were
unanimou&s;ly of opi|nion that the &s;entence was legal; wherefore the King
re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;uffer the extremity of the law. Still, however,
there was another attempt made <PB N="211" REF="214"> to &s;ave him: One of
tho&s;e who had been his Judges at Port&s;mouth, and was al&s;o a member of the
hou&s;e of commons, informed that a&s;&s;embly, that he, as well as &s;ome
others who had &s;at upon the Admiral's tryal, de&s;ired to be relea&s;ed from
the oath of &s;ecrecy im|po&s;ed upon Courts-Martial, that they might
di&s;clo&s;e the grounds on which &s;entence of death had pa&s;&s;ed upon
Admiral Byng, and, perhaps, di&s;cover &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as might &s;hew
the &s;entence to be impro|per. To this the hou&s;e paid little regard; but his
Maje&s;ty thought fit to re&s;pite the execution, till the &s;cruples of the
Court-Martial &s;hould be more clearly explained. A bill therefore pa&s;t the
hou&s;e of com|mons for relea&s;ing them from their oath; but when it came to
be debated among the Lords, and after the members of the Court-Martial were
examined touch|ing their rea&s;ons, the Peers found no rea&s;on for
pa&s;&s;|ing the bill; and it was rejected. The Admiral be|ing thus abandoned
to the &s;troke of ju&s;tice, re&s;olved at lea&s;t, by the bravery of his
dying, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to &s;hew the inju&s;tice of the imputation of his
being a coward. He maintained to the la&s;t his na|tural &s;erenity; and, on
the day fixed for his execu|tion, when the boats belonging to the fleet, being
manned and armed, attended this &s;olemnity in the harbour, the Admiral
advanced from the cabbin, where he had been impri&s;oned, to the deck, the
place appointed for execution, with a compo&s;ed &s;tep, and re&s;olute
countenance. He then delivered a paper, containing the following addre&s;s:

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>EUROPE has often been compared to one re|public obeying one law,
namely, that of na|tions; and compo&s;ed of provinces, each of which is
prevented from becoming too great by the univer&s;al jealou&s;y of the re&s;t.
A quarrel therefore between any two of the&s;e is apt to involve the whole in
war; but, particularly, if the di&s;pute happens to ari&s;e between tho&s;e who
are reckoned the leading powers in this a&s;&s;emblage of nations. A war begun
between France and England, for a de&s;art and trackle&s;s wild in the remote
parts of Europe, &s;eemed now &s;preading fa&s;t through the whole world; and
the appearance of their commotions revived all the ancient jealou&s;ies and
claims among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The French, at the breaking out of this new war, though they were
&s;ucce&s;sful at its commencement, were very &s;en&s;ible that they could not
long hold their acqui&s;itions again&s;t &s;uch a &s;uperiority as the
Engli&s;h were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at &s;ea, and the numberle&s;s re&s;ources
they had of a&s;&s;i&s;ting their colonies with all the nece&s;|&s;aries for
war. Being therefore apprized that a naval war mu&s;t, in the end, turn out to
their di&s;advantage, <PB N="214" REF="217"> they made no &s;cruple of
declaring that they would revenge the injuries they &s;u&s;tained in their
colonies, or by &s;ea, upon the King of England's territories in Germany, which
they &s;ecretly hoped would be a mo|tive to his complying with their demands,
or divid|ing the Engli&s;h forces, or draining their finances with heavy
&s;ub&s;idies, as they knew his affection for his native country. In the&s;e
hopes they were not much di&s;appointed; the court of London immediately, to
&s;ecure the Electorate of Hanover, entered into a treaty with the Empre&s;s of
Ru&s;&s;ia, by which a body of fifty-five thou&s;and men &s;hould be ready to
act in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, in ca&s;e Hanover &s;hould be in|vaded, for
which the Ru&s;&s;ian Empre&s;s was to receive an hundred thou&s;and pounds
annually, to be paid in advance.</P>
<P>His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had long con&s;idered him&s;elf as the
guardian of the intere&s;ts of Germany, and was &s;tartled at the treaty. This
was Frederic III, a Prince adorned with all the arts of peace, and whom you
have &s;een al&s;o acting as the mo&s;t con&s;ummate General. He had learned to
read men, by being him&s;elf bred in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; and to love
his &s;ubjects, by having experienced their attachment. He therefore took the
fir&s;t opportunity to declare, that he would not &s;uffer any foreign forces
to enter the Empire, either as auxiliaries or principals. This con&s;ummate
politician had, it &s;eems, been already apprized of &s;ome &s;ecret
negotiations between the Au&s;trians, whom he looked upon as concealed
ene|mies, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, for entering his dominions, and &s;tripping him
of the province of Sile&s;ia, which had been conceded to him in the la&s;t
treaty of peace. His Britannic Maje&s;ty, who&s;e fears for Hanover guided his
pre&s;ent councils, now &s;aw him&s;elf in the very &s;ituation he mo&s;t
dreaded, expo&s;ed to the re|&s;entments of France and Pru&s;&s;ia, who could
at once invade and over-run his Electorate, while his Ru&s;&s;ian 
<PB N="215" REF="218"> allies lay at too great a di&s;tance to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him. How|ever, all he wi&s;hed was to keep the enemy out of Germany; and this
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia made a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of doing, as well as he. From
the &s;imilitude of their intentions, therefore, the&s;e two Monarchs were
induced to unite their intere&s;ts; and, as they both only de&s;ired the &s;ame
thing, they came to an agreement to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other mutually in keeping
all foreign forces out of the Empire.</P>
<P>From this alliance both powers hoped great ad|vantages; the
pre&s;erving the peace of Germany was the apparent good, but each had other
peculiar bene|fits in view. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia knew the Au|&s;trians to be
his enemies, and the Ru&s;&s;ians to be in league with them again&s;t him; an
alliance therefore with the court of London kept back the Ru&s;&s;ians whom he
dreaded, and gave him hopes of taking an ample &s;atisfaction from Au&s;tria,
whom he &s;u&s;pected. As for France, he counted upon it as a natural ally,
which, from the long and hereditary enmity with the Au&s;trians, could not, by
declaring again&s;t him, join them to whom they had &s;uch various rea&s;ons
for political aver&s;ion. The Elector of Hanover, on the other hand, had
&s;till &s;tronger expectations of the benefits that would ari&s;e from this
alliance. He thus procured a near and powerful ally; an ally which he thought
the French, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would not venture to
di&s;oblige; he counted upon the Au&s;trians as naturally attached to his
intere&s;ts by former &s;ervices and friend&s;hip; and the Ru&s;&s;ians, at
lea&s;t, as likely to continue neuter, from their former &s;tipulations and
&s;ub&s;idy. Such were the motives to this alliance; but both were deceived in
every par|ticular. And though this alliance a&s;toni&s;hed Europe at that time,
it &s;oon produced another &s;till more ex|traordinary. The Au&s;trian Queen
had long medi|tated de&s;igns for recovering Sile&s;ia, which, in her exigency,
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had invaded, and ex|pected <PB N="216" REF="219"> the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ru&s;&s;ia to effect her purpo&s;es. By this la&s;t treaty,
however, &s;he &s;aw England joining with Pru&s;&s;ia in fru&s;trating her
hopes; and, deprived of one ally, &s;ought about, in order to &s;ub&s;titute
ano|ther in the room. She therefore applied to France; and, in order to procure
the friend&s;hip of that power, gave up her barrier in the Netherlands, which
England had been for ages acquiring with its blood and trea|&s;ure. By this
extraordinary revolution the whole political &s;y&s;tem of Europe a&s;&s;umed a
new face, and it pretty clearly &s;hews that events guide the politician, while
the politician &s;eldom guides events; or, to u&s;e words of Tacitus, there is
but very little differ|ence between the art and its futility.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this treaty between France and Au&s;tria, was no
&s;ooner ratified, than the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia was invited to accede to
it; which propo&s;al &s;he ardently embraced. By concurring with their
propo&s;als, Ru&s;&s;ia had another opportunity of &s;ending her forces into
the we&s;tern parts of Europe, which was all &s;he had hoped by the
&s;ub&s;idiary treaty with England. A &s;ettlement in the we&s;tern parts of
Eu|rope was what this fierce northern power long want|ed an opportunity of
obtaining; for, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, &s;he could then pour in fre&s;h
forces at any time upon the more effeminate and contending &s;tates; and,
perhaps, at length, obtain univer&s;al Empire. The intrigues of France were
al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed with Sweden. A war between that nation and
Pru&s;&s;ia was kindled up, though contrary to the incli|nation of their
Sovereign, who had the natural mo|tives of kindred for being aver&s;e to that
mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus all the alliances which England had long been purcha&s;ing upon
the continent, and many of the treaties which &s;he had been long making, with
all the bu&s;tle of negotiation, &s;eemed now de&s;troyed. The forces of the
contending powers therefore, now drawn out on each &s;ide, &s;tood thus:
England oppo&s;ed <PB N="217" REF="220"> France in America and A&s;ia; France
attacked Han|over on the continent of Europe. This country the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia undertook to protect, while England promi&s;ed to furni&s;h him
with troops and money to a&s;&s;i&s;t his operations. On the other hand,
Au&s;tria had de&s;igns upon Pru&s;&s;ia, and drew the Elector of Saxony into
the &s;ame pur&s;uits; &s;he was al&s;o &s;econded in her views by Ru&s;&s;ia,
Sweden, and France, while the re&s;t of the powers of Europe continued
&s;pectators of the contention.</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;igns of Au&s;tria, for the recovery of her lo&s;t
dominions, were too apparent not to be early di&s;covered by &s;o vigilant a
Monarch as that of Pru&s;|&s;ia; he &s;aw that preparations were making
again&s;t him by that power in Bohemia and Moravia, while the Elector of
Saxony, under the pretence of a mi|litary parade, drew together about &s;ixteen
thou&s;and men, which occupied the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Pirna. The &s;ecret
treaty al&s;o between the courts of Ru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria did not e&s;cape
his penetration; by this it was privately &s;tipulated, that the treating
powers &s;hould, in ca&s;e of apprehending any breach of the pre&s;ent peace,
unite again&s;t Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;hare the dominions of that crown between
them. This he con&s;idered as an offen&s;ive alliance; the treating powers
alledged, that it was only defen&s;ive. As preparations for war, however, were
carrying on with the utmo&s;t diligence on either &s;ide; the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, in order to be confirmed in what he al|ready &s;u&s;pected,
ordered his mini&s;ter at Vienna to demand a clear explication, and proper
a&s;&s;urances concerning the preparations he &s;aw making. He at fir&s;t
received an equivocal anw&s;er; but, ordering his mini&s;ter to demand a
categorical reply, whether the Empre&s;s Queen was for peace or war; and to
re|quire a po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he had no intention to attack him
that year, or the next; an ambiguous an&s;wer was returned to &s;o plain a
que&s;tion, which <PB N="218" REF="221"> undoubted manife&s;ted an inclination
for war. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> therefore thought
proper no longer to &s;u&s;pend his opera+tions, but to carry the war into the
enemies country<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> rather than to wait
for it in his own. He entere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> with
a large army into Saxony, and, in the u&s;ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;train of civility, demanded from the Elector a pa&s;|&s;age
through that country, which he well knew the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it was not
able to refu&s;e. In the mean time, he di&s;gui&s;ed all his &s;u&s;picions of
the Elector's having &s;ecretly treated with his enemies; and, upon the
latter's propo&s;ing to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality, the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely plea&s;|ed at the offer; but
de&s;ired, as a proof of the &s;ince|rity of his intentions, to &s;eparate the
army of the Electorate, for which there could po&s;&s;ibly be no oc|ca&s;ion,
in ca&s;e of the neutrality propo&s;ed. This, however, the Elector of Saxony
thought it prudent to refu&s;e, which was probably what the other eagerly
de&s;ired; for, in con&s;equence of his refu&s;al, the King formed a kind of
blockade about the Saxon camp, in order to reduce it by famine; for &s;uch was
the &s;ituation of this &s;pot, on which the Saxons had en|camped, that though
a &s;mall army could defend it again&s;t the mo&s;t numerous forces, yet the
&s;ame diffi|culty attended leaving it, that &s;erved to render it
in|acce&s;&s;ible to an enemy. Of this his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty took the
advantage; and, by blocking up every place of egre&s;s, thus cut off their
provi&s;ions, and the whole body was obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of
war.</P>
<P>In a detail of the tran&s;actions of England it will not be
nece&s;&s;ary to recapitulate the numerous marches, victories, &s;ieges, and
repul&s;es of this great foreign ally. Whatever either former hi&s;tory had
&s;hewn, or even romance might feign, was outdone both by his expedition and
intrepidity. King only of a very &s;mall territory, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by England,
who&s;e &s;ituation was too remote to give any con&s;iderable &s;uccours, 
<PB N="219" REF="222"> oppo&s;ed and &s;urrounded by all the mo&s;t formidable
powers of Europe, he &s;till oppo&s;ed them on every &s;ide; he invades
Bohemia, defeats the Au|&s;trian General at Lowo&s;chtch, retreats, begins his
&s;econd campaign with another victory near Prague, is upon the point of taking
that city, but by a teme|rity in&s;pired by former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, attacking
the Au|&s;trians at a di&s;advantage near Kolin, he is defeated, and obliged to
rai&s;e the &s;iege: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Fortune,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has turned her back
upon me this day. I ought to have ex|pected it; &s;he is a female, and I am no
gallant; &s;ucce&s;s often occa&s;ions a de&s;tructive confidence; but another
time we will do better.</HI></Q></P>
<P>One misfortune &s;eemed to follow another; the Hanoverians, who had
joined with him and England, in the alliance, had armed in his favour,
command|ed by the Duke of Cumberland. As this army, which con&s;i&s;ted of
three thou&s;and eight hun|dred men, was greatly out-numbered by the French,
they were obliged continually to retire before them. The pa&s;&s;age of the
river We&s;er might have been di&s;puted with &s;ome hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; yet
the Hano|verians permitted them to pa&s;s it unmole&s;ted. Their army,
therefore, was now driven from one part of the country to an other, till, at
length, it made a &s;tand near a village called Ha&s;tenback, where it was
judged they would be be&s;t able to &s;u&s;tain the &s;uperio|rity of the
enemies numbers. However, notwith|&s;tanding all the efforts of di&s;cipline,
and the advan|tages of &s;ituation, the weaker &s;ide was &s;till obliged to
retire; and, leaving the field of battle to the French, retreated towards
Stade. By taking this route they marched into a country, from whence they could
neither procure provi&s;ions, nor yet had an opportunity of attacking the enemy
upon equal terms. Unable, by their &s;ituation, to retire; or, by their
&s;trength, to advance; they were compelled to &s;ign a capitulation, by which
the whole army laid down <PB N="220" REF="223"> their arms, and were
di&s;per&s;ed into different quarters of cantonment. By this remarkable treaty,
which went by the name of the treaty of Clo&s;ter Seven, the Hanoverians were
quite &s;ubdued, and all the French forces let loo&s;e upon the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this Monarch was now become de&s;perate; nor
could human prudence fore&s;ee how he could extricate him&s;elf from his
di&s;tre&s;s. The French forces, now united, invaded his dominions on one
&s;ide; the Ru&s;&s;ians, who, for &s;ome time, had hovered over his dominions
in another part, all at once ha&s;tened onward to overwhelm him, marking their
way with &s;laughter and cruelty; a large body of Au&s;trians entered
Sile&s;ia, and penetrated as far as Bre&s;lau, and turning to Schweidnitz,
&s;at down be|fore that important fortre&s;s, which, after a long &s;iege,
&s;urrendered. Another army of the &s;ame nation en|tered Lu&s;atia, made
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Zittau, and pre&s;&s;ing forward, laid the capital of
Berlin under contribution. Twenty-two thou&s;and Swedes pierced into
Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and exacted
tribute from the whole country. It was in vain that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
faced about to every invader, though his enemies fled before him, while he
pur&s;ued one body, another pe|netrated his territories in the mean time; and
his do|minions, even in the mid&s;t of victory, were every day contracting. The
greate&s;t part were either taken or laid under contribution, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ene|mies; and he was left without any alliance or
a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, but what the Briti&s;h parliament might think proper to
afford.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uccours could, at be&s;t, have been, for &s;ome time, but
ineffectual; however, it was re&s;olved by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, that
&s;omething &s;hould be done, and accordingly an enterprize was planned
again&s;t the French coa&s;t, which, by drawing off their atten|tion from their
German enemies, might give the latter <PB N="221" REF="224"> kingdom time to
re&s;pire, and call off a part of the French to the defence of their own.
Be&s;ide this in|tention, England al&s;o hoped to be able to give a blow to
their marine, by de&s;troying &s;uch &s;hips as were laid up, or building in
the harbour of Rochfort, the city again&s;t which this expedition was
de&s;tined. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try had kept that object of their opera|tions
a profound &s;ecret; and France was filled with alarms till, at length, it was
found that the fleet ap|peared before Rochfort, where it &s;pent &s;ome time in
deliberating upon what manner to proceed. At la&s;t it was re&s;olved to
&s;ecure the little i&s;land of Aix, an ea&s;y conque&s;t, which, while
performing, the militia of the country had time to a&s;&s;emble, and there was
an appearance of two camps upon the &s;hore. The commanders therefore, who, by
the badne&s;s of the weather, were, at fir&s;t, prevented from landing, now
feared equal danger from the numbers of the enemy which were to oppo&s;e them.
They took into con&s;i|deration the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t, the danger of
landing, the time the city had to prepare for a vigorous defence, and their own
unfitne&s;s for any other methods to reduce it but that of a &s;udden attack.
This con&s;ideration induced them to de&s;i&s;t from further operations; and
they unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved to return home, without making any attempt.
Nothing could equal the di&s;content of the Engli&s;h upon &s;eeing this
expedition, of which they had con|ceived &s;uch expectations, return
un&s;ucce&s;sful. It pro|duced, as u&s;ual, a conte&s;t between tho&s;e who
plan|ned, and tho&s;e who were &s;ent to execute it. The military men
repre&s;ented it as u&s;ele&s;s and ra&s;h; the mini&s;ters exclaimed at the
timidity and delays of tho&s;e from who&s;e vigour &s;ucce&s;s was to be
expected. A Court of Enquiry cen&s;ured the commander; but a Court-Martial
acquitted him. This, like almo&s;t all the former operations, &s;erved to
embitter party, and increa&s;e de&s;pondence. A great man was even heard 
<PB N="222" REF="225"> to &s;ay, upon a very &s;olemn occa&s;ion, that he
believed the commanders of every military operation were re|&s;olved upon doing
nothing. The tumult of the people was now &s;unk from turbulent clamour into
&s;ullen di&s;content; they &s;aw only gloomy pro&s;pects on every &s;ide,
their armies de&s;troyed, their fleets unactive, their expeditions ridiculous,
and the only ally they had left in Europe, that would fight their battles, upon
the point of being overwhelmed by &s;uperiority of numbers. Such were the
beginnings of this war, from which the timid foreboded national &s;ervitude,
and a total de&s;truction of all maritime power, and even the mo&s;t &s;anguine
only hoped for a peace that might re&s;tore them to former equality.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms, and of their
allies, at the beginning of this war. Every day the pre&s;s, teemed with
productions which either reproached their cowardice, or foreboded their
undoing. Yet &s;till the hopes of the parliament ro&s;e with their
di&s;appointments, and every re&s;ource &s;eem|ed to augment with their
expences. Tho' the &s;up|plies for this de&s;tructive and hitherto &s;hameful
war, were enormous, yet they were rai&s;ed as &s;oon as grant|ed. The officers
of the army &s;eemed rou&s;ed into vi|gour by the national reproaches. A&s;ia,
however, was the country in which &s;ucce&s;s fir&s;t began to dawn upon the
Briti&s;h intere&s;t, and where we fir&s;t learned the art of again conquering
the enemy. A war in Europe could not be proclaimed between the two great
powers, without being felt in the remote&s;t parts of the globe. This immen&s;e
tract of country, which was the theatre of an A&s;iatic war, comprehends the 
<PB N="223" REF="226"> whole penin&s;ula of India Proper. On the coa&s;ts of
this great territory, the Engli&s;h, the French, and &s;e|veral other powers of
Europe, had built forts, with the original con&s;ent of the Mogul, who claims
the &s;overeignty of the whole Empire. Whatever his right may be to this
dominion, his power is &s;carce felt or acknowledged in many of the remoter
pro|vinces; and even the Governors or Nabobs, who were originally of his
appointment, have render|ed them&s;elves independent, and exert an ab&s;olute
dominion over their re&s;pective territories, with|out acknowledging his
&s;uperiority, either by tri|bute or homage. In the conte&s;ts of the&s;e
Prin|ces, therefore, in&s;tead of having recour&s;e to the Mogul for redre&s;s,
they apply to the European powers, whom they can either purcha&s;e or
per&s;uade to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. The war between England and France, in the&s;e
remote parts, fir&s;t began by each power's &s;iding with two contending
Nabobs, and thus, by degrees, becoming principals in the di&s;|pute. The
&s;ucce&s;s, on each &s;ide, for &s;ome time after the treaty of Aix la
Chapelle, &s;eemed doubtful, till, at length, the affairs of the Engli&s;h
&s;eemed to gain the a&s;cendancy by the courage and conduct of Mr. Clive, a
gentleman who fir&s;t entered into the &s;ervice of the company as a clerk, but
&s;oon &s;hewed his ta|lents more adapted for war. By his vigilance and courage
the province of Arcot was cleared of the enemy, the French General taken
pri&s;oner, and the Nabob, whom the Engli&s;h &s;upported, rein&s;tated in the
government of which he had been formerly de|prived. The French, di&s;couraged
by the&s;e misfor|tunes, and &s;en&s;ible of their own inferiority in this part
of the world, &s;ent over a commi&s;&s;ary with a view to re&s;tore peace; and
a convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded, im|porting,
that the territories taken on either &s;ide &s;ince the la&s;t peace &s;hould
be mutually re&s;tored; that the <PB N="224" REF="227"> Nabobs advanced by the
influence of either party, &s;hould be acknowledged by both; and that, for the
future, neither &s;hould interfere in the differences be|tween the Princes of
the country. This ce&s;&s;ation, however, was not of long duration; compacts
made between trading companies can never be of long con|tinuance, when there is
a pro&s;pect of advantage to either &s;ide from their infraction. In a few
months after both &s;ides renewed their operations, no longer as auxiliaries
but as rivals in arms and commerce. What the motives to this infraction were
are not &s;uf|ficiently known; wherever there is trade there mu&s;t be a degree
of avarice; and that is a pa&s;&s;ion too often the parent of inju&s;tice and
cruelty. Certain it is that the Viceroy of Bengal, from motives of per|&s;onal
re&s;entment, declared again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and, levying a numerous army,
laid &s;iege to Calcutta, one of their forts, which was in no &s;ituation to
endure the attack even of barbarians. It was taken by a&s;|&s;ault; and the
garri&s;on, to the number of one hun|dred and forty-&s;ix per&s;ons, were
crowded into a nar|row pri&s;on called the <HI>Black Hole,</HI> about eighteen
feet &s;quare, without any entrance for air, except by two iron windows to the
we&s;t, which, by no means, af|forded a &s;ufficient quantity for the
&s;upporting life in &s;uch numbers. In &s;uch a burning climate it is
ter|rible to conceive the &s;ituation of wretches thus im|mured and
&s;uffocating each other. Their fir&s;t effort, upon finding the danger of
their horrid confinement, was to break open the door; but this being
impo&s;|&s;ible, they endeavoured to excite the compa&s;&s;ion or the avidity
of the guard, by offering him a large &s;um of money for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
in removing them to &s;epa|rate pri&s;ons, with which he was not able to
comply, as the Viceroy was a&s;leep, and no per&s;on dur&s;t di&s;|turb him.
They were now therefore left without all hopes of relief to peri&s;h, and the
whole pri&s;on was filled with groans, &s;hrieks, conte&s;t and confu|&s;ion. 
<PB N="225" REF="228"> This turbulence &s;oon after &s;unk into languor and
de&s;pair; and towards morning all was horrid &s;ilence and de&s;olation. Of an
hundred and forty-&s;ix who had entered alive, but twenty-three only
&s;ur|vived, and of the&s;e &s;everal died by putrid fevers upon their being
&s;et free.</P>
<P>The reduction of this important fortre&s;s &s;erved to interrupt the
pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h com|pany; but the fortune of Mr.
Clive &s;till vanqui&s;hed every ob&s;tacle; a fleet, under the command of
Ad|miral Wat&s;on, con&s;pired with his efforts, and helped him in his
victories. Angria, a piratical Prince, who had long annoyed the company's
&s;ettlements in the neighbourhood of Bombay, fir&s;t felt the weight of our
naval power. This Prince maintained a large number of gallies, with which he
would attack the large&s;t &s;hips, when he found a proper opportunity; and, by
this means, he exacted a tribute from every European power for a permi&s;&s;ion
to trade. To &s;ub|due &s;uch a dangerous enemy to commerce, Admiral Wat&s;on
and Colonel Clive &s;ailed into his harbour of Geriah, though they
&s;u&s;tained a warm fire as they pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;oon threw all his fleet
and his fort into flames. The next day the fort &s;urrendered at di&s;cre|tion,
where the conquerors found a large quantity of warlike &s;tores, and effects to
the value of one hun|dred and thirty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>From this conque&s;t Mr. Clive went on to take revenge for the
treatment of the Engli&s;h at Calcutta, and about the beginning of December
arrived at Ba|la&s;ore, in the kingdom of Bengal. There was but &s;mall
oppo&s;ition made to the fleet, or the army, till they came before Calcutta,
the &s;cene of former cru|elty; but as &s;oon as the Admiral, with two &s;hips,
arrived before the town, he received a furious fire from all the batteries.
This, however, he returned with &s;till greater execution, and, in le&s;s than
two hours, the place was abandoned. Thus, by the con|que&s;t 
<PB N="226" REF="229"> of this and the former fortre&s;s, the Engli&s;h be|came
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the two &s;tronge&s;t &s;ettlements on the banks of the
Ganges. Soon after the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, Hughly, a city of great trade was
reduced with as little difficulty, and all the Viceroy of Bengal's
&s;tore-hou&s;es and granaries were de&s;troyed. This barbarous Prince,
incen&s;ed at the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;embled an army of ten thou&s;and
hor&s;e, and fifteen thou&s;and foot, fully re&s;olved to expel the Engli&s;h
out of his domi|nions. Upon the fir&s;t intelligence of his march, Colonel
Clive begged from the Admiral a reinforce|ment of men from the &s;hips; and
&s;ix hundred &s;ea|men were accordingly &s;oon added to his little army. The
numerous forces of the Viceroy of Bengal ap|peared, and Colonel Clive advanced
in three columns to attack him. But, though the forces were &s;o &s;eem|ingly
di&s;proportioned, with re&s;pect to number, the victory &s;oon declared in
favour of the Engli&s;h com|mander. In fact, what could the timid A&s;iatic
&s;ol|dier do again&s;t European troops, hardened by war, and inured to all the
vici&s;&s;itudes of climate. All the cu&s;toms, habits, opinions, of the
A&s;iatics tend to enfeeble the body, and effeminate the mind. When we conceive
a body of men led up to the attack, dre&s;&s;ed in long &s;ilk garments, with
no other courage but that in&s;pired by opium; with no other fears from defeat
but that of changing their mode of &s;lavery; their chief commander mounted on
an elephant, and con&s;equently a more con&s;picuous object for aim; their
artillery drawn by oxen, impatient and furious upon the &s;lighte&s;t wound;
every &s;oldier utterly un|acquainted with that cool intrepidity which provides
again&s;t danger, and only taught to fight by the &s;ame arts that rai&s;e
their pa&s;&s;ions. If we con&s;ider all the&s;e circum&s;tances, it will be no
way &s;urpri&s;ing if one or two thou&s;and Europeans &s;hould ea&s;ily
di&s;comfit thirty thou&s;and Indians. And all the heroi&s;m of a Cyrus, or an
Alexander, in gaining &s;uch di&s;propor|tioned <PB N="227" REF="230">
victories, will no longer be the &s;ubject of ad|miration.</P>
<P>A victory &s;o ea&s;ily acquired by a foreign enemy, &s;oon rendered
the Viceroy of Bengal contemptible to his &s;ubjects at home. His pre&s;ent
cowardice render|ed him de&s;picable; his former in&s;olence and cruelty
odious. A con&s;piracy was projected again&s;t him by Alikan, his prime
mini&s;ter, and the Engli&s;h having private intimations of the de&s;ign,
re&s;olved to &s;eize the opportunity of &s;econding it with all their
endeavours. Accordingly Colonel Clive marched forward, took the town of Cutwa
in his march, and &s;oon came up with the Viceroy's army; and, after a &s;hort
conte&s;t, put the whole to flight, with terrible &s;laughter. Ali|kan, who had
fir&s;t incited his ma&s;ter to this under|taking, had hitherto concealed his
attachments, either through fear or perfidy; but, after this victory, he
open|ly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the Engli&s;h, and was therefore &s;olemnly
proclaimed Viceroy of Bengal, Bahar, and Oriza, in the room of the former
Viceroy, who was as &s;olemnly depo&s;ed, and &s;oon after put to death by his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. The new Viceroy was not in&s;en&s;ible of the gratitude he
owed the Engli&s;h, for their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in his promotion. He granted
liberally all their demands, &s;atisfied them even to the mo&s;t ex|tended
wi&s;h of avarice, and took every method to demon&s;trate his pride in their
alliance.</P>
<P>Yet not the Indians alone, but the French al&s;o, &s;ubmitted to
Colonel Clive's a&s;&s;iduity and courage, &s;econded by the endeavours of the
Admirals Wat&s;on and Pocock. Chadenagore, a French &s;ettlement higher up the
river than Calcutta, of great &s;trength, and the mo&s;t important of any
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that na|tion in the bay of Bengal, &s;ubmitted to the
Engli&s;h arms. The goods and money found in the place were con&s;iderable; but
the chief damage the French &s;u&s;tained was, in the ruin of their head
&s;ettlement on the Ganges, by which they had long divided the 
<PB N="228" REF="231"> commerce of this part of India. Thus, in one cam|paign,
the Engli&s;h, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, became po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of an immen&s;e
tract of country, &s;uperior in wealth, fertility, extent, and number of
inhabitants, to many of Europe. Above two millions &s;terling were paid to the
company and &s;ufferers at Calcutta; the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen &s;hared &s;ix
hundred thou&s;and pounds, and the Engli&s;h forces became too formid|able for
re&s;i&s;tance. Yet, perhaps, this remote power will, one day, either &s;erve
to drain from the mother-country all its u&s;eful hands, or our victories will
&s;erve to teach the native barbarians to avail them&s;elves of their numbers,
and, by being frequently defeated, they will, at la&s;t, learn to conquer.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h was not a little alarm|ing to the
French mini&s;try at home; and it is be|lieved that even the Dutch them&s;elves
entertained &s;ome jealou&s;y of their growing greatne&s;s. A con&s;i|derable
reinforcement was therefore &s;ent from France, under the command of General
Lally, an Iri&s;hman, who was reckoned one of the brave&s;t, yet the mo&s;t
whimfical man in the French &s;ervice. He had been, from his earlie&s;t years,
bred a &s;oldier of fortune, and carried the military &s;pirit of honour to its
utmo&s;t li|mits. Under his guidance the French affairs &s;eem|ed, for &s;ome
time, to wear a better face; he took fort St. David's, plundered a town
belonging to the King of Tanjour, in alliance with the Engli&s;h, and after
laid &s;iege to his capital. Failing in his de&s;ign upon this city, he entered
the province of Arcot, and prepared for laying &s;iege to Madra&s;s, the chief
&s;ettlement of our company, upon the coa&s;t of Coro|mandel. In the &s;iege of
this important fortre&s;s, a greater variety of difficulties pre&s;ented than
he had expected. The artillery of the garri&s;on was well ma|naged, while, on
the other &s;ide, the French acted with the utmo&s;t timidity; it was in vain
that their commander exhorted them to proceed, though a <PB N="229" REF="232">
breach was made, and lay open for fifteen days, not one of them dared to
venture out to the a&s;&s;ault. Be&s;ide this, they were ill &s;upplied with
provi&s;ions; and the arrival of a reinforcement in the garri&s;on &s;oon
after, &s;erved to bani&s;h all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. After a bri&s;k fire they
rai&s;ed the &s;iege; and this mi&s;carriage &s;o intirely depre&s;&s;ed the
ardour of the enemy, that they appeared quite di&s;pirited in almo&s;t every
en&s;uing en|gagement. In this manner, therefore, their affairs went on
declining, not le&s;s by land than by &s;ea. There were &s;everal engagements
between the two fleets, in which the French, though &s;uperior in number of
&s;hips and men, always declined a deci&s;ive engagement.</P>
<P>But the French were not the only enemies the Engli&s;h had to fear
in this part of the world; the jealou&s;y of the Dutch was excited by our
repeated &s;ucce&s;s, and the late exten&s;ion of our power. As this di&s;pute,
however trifling it may &s;eem, may, one day, be of greater con&s;equence than
it appears at pre|&s;ent, I &s;hall be more particular in my relation of
it.</P>
<P>Under a pretence of reinforcing their garri&s;ons in Bengal, the
Dutch equipped an armament of &s;even &s;hips, which was ordered to &s;ail up
the Ganges, and render their fort at a place called Chincura &s;o for|midable
as to be able to bid defiance to the power of Britain, and thus &s;ecure to
them&s;elves the trade for &s;alt-petre, which this place afforded. This
de&s;ign, however, Colonel Clive thought incumbent on him, if po&s;&s;ible, to
defeat; and &s;ending the Dutch com|mander a letter, he informed him that he
could not permit his landing, and marching forces to Chincura. To this
me&s;&s;age the Dutchman replied, that he had no &s;uch de&s;igns as were
imputed to him; and he only beg|ged liberty to land his troops to refre&s;h
them; a reque&s;t which was readily granted. He made the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions,
however, only till he knew that the &s;hips which were to &s;econd his
operations, were come up the river, and <PB N="230" REF="233"> then, throwing
off the ma&s;k, he began his march to Chincura, and took &s;everal &s;mall
ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Engli&s;h, to retaliate for the affront he
pre|tended to have &s;u&s;tained in being denied permi&s;&s;ion to proceed.
Whether, upon this occa&s;ion the Cal|cutta Indiaman was &s;ent out to
interrupt their pro|gre&s;s, or was only pur&s;uing its way homeward, is not
clearly known; but certain it is, that the Dutch commander threatened to &s;ink
it, if it pre&s;umed to pa&s;s him. The Engli&s;h captain &s;eeing them point
their guns, as if they really re&s;olved to put their threats in execution,
returned to Calcutta, where two other India &s;hips lay at anchor, and reported
his adventure to Colonel Clive, who in&s;tantly or|dered the three Indiamen to
prepare for battle. The Dutch fleet were not remi&s;s in advancing to meet
them. After a few broad&s;ides, however, the Dutch Commodore &s;truck, and the
re&s;t of his fleet followed the example. The victory being thus obtained
without any lo&s;s to the Engli&s;h, Captain Wil&s;on, who com|manded in the
expedition, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prizes which had greatly &s;uffered,
and the crews were &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Engli&s;h fort. In the mean time
their land forces, which amounted to eleven hundred men, were totally defeated
by Colonel Ford, &s;ent upon that duty by Clive. A con&s;iderable part were
killed, and the re&s;t were made pri&s;oners of war. During this conte&s;t, the
Nabob pre&s;erved a &s;u&s;picious neu|trality, ready, as it &s;hould &s;eem,
to join with the conquerors. Fortune, however, no &s;ooner deter|mined in
favour of the Engli&s;h, than he offered them his &s;ervices, and profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf ready to demoli&s;h the Dutch fortification of Chincura. This
conte&s;t was repre&s;ented in very different lights to the re|&s;pective
governments at home; the Dutch declaim|ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h,
oppre&s;&s;ing all who at|tempted to trade in the Indies; while the Engli&s;h,
on the other hand, reminded the Dutch of their <PB N="231" REF="234"> former
cruelties, and of their de&s;ire of gain, even at the expence of every moral
obligation. However, &s;oon after a negotiation en&s;ued; the Dutch wi&s;ely
gave way to a power they were unable to with&s;tand. A treaty was concluded,
and peace was re&s;tored, &s;eemingly to the &s;atisfaction of both parties.
Such is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of this conte&s;t, which, proba|bly, contains
the &s;eeds of future di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The Dutch will, upon all occa&s;ions,
think it allowable to increa&s;e their power in India to what&s;oever pitch
they think proper; and the Engli&s;h will ever find it their intere&s;t to
repel them. It may thus happen, that the amity of the two powers in Europe will
not be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve unanimity in &s;o di&s;tant a part of the
world. In this manner, while Great Britain puts an end to one war, &s;he often
lays the foundation for another; for, extended Empire ever produces an
increa&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity to defend it.</P>
<P>Our &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the French on the coa&s;t of Coromandel
was not le&s;s con&s;picuous; our troops were headed by Colonel Coote, a native
of Ireland, a man of prudence and bravery; he marched again&s;t General Lally,
took the city of Wandewa&s;h in his way, reduced Carangoly, a fortre&s;s
commanded by Colonel O Kenedy; and, at length, came up with the French General,
who was equally de&s;irous of the engagement. It is remarkable enough, that the
commanders, on either &s;ide, were countrymen; but this did not, in the
lea&s;t, abate their attachment to the different crowns they &s;erved. In the
morning early the French advanced within three quarters of a mile of the
Engli&s;h line, and the cannonading be|gan with great fury on both &s;ides; the
engagement continued with much ob&s;tinacy till about two in the afternoon,
when the French gave way, and fled to|wards their camp; which, however, they as
quick|ly abandoned, and left their cannon, and the field of battle, to the
conquerors. Their lo&s;ing the city of <PB N="232" REF="235"> Arcot was the
con&s;equence of this victory; and no|thing now remained to them of all their
va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in India but Pondicherry, their &s;tronge&s;t,
larg|e&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful &s;ettlement in that part of the world. This
capital of the French Indian power, in the days of its pro&s;perity, exceeded
all other Eu|ropean &s;ettlements there, in trade, opulence, and &s;plendor;
and was &s;till the repo&s;itory for all the French wealth, which remained
after repeated de|feats. As &s;oon as the fortre&s;&s;es adjacent to this
im|portant place were reduced, Colonel Coote &s;at down before it, re&s;olved
upon the blockade by land, while Admiral Stevens &s;hut up their harbour by
&s;ea. A regular &s;iege was, at that time, impracticable; from the periodical
rains which in that climate were &s;oon expected to ob&s;truct &s;uch
operations. The&s;e di&s;ad|vantages were even &s;ufficient to repre&s;s any
attempts what&s;oever; but, notwith&s;tanding the inclemency of the climate,
the Engli&s;h commander continued be|fore the place for full &s;even months.
Neither rains nor &s;torms were, in the lea&s;t, able to abate their
a&s;|&s;iduity; they continued the &s;iege, and pre&s;&s;ed the garri&s;on in
&s;uch a manner that they were reduced to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s.
Lally, however, was re|&s;olutely bent on &s;uffering every calamity rather
than yield this la&s;t &s;take of French power in India, though his &s;oldiers
were obliged to feed on dogs and cats, and even bought &s;uch wretched
provi&s;ions extremely dear, (eight crowns having been given for the fle&s;h of
a dog) yet &s;till he determined to hold out. In the mid&s;t of this
di&s;tre&s;s, fortune &s;eemed to give an oppor|tunity of relief, had it been
properly &s;econded. In the beginning of January one of tho&s;e terrible
&s;torms which are common in tho&s;e climates, but of who&s;e violence we can
have but little idea in Europe, wreck|ed a large part of the Engli&s;h fleet
that was block|ing up the harbour of Pondicherry. This was a blow 
<PB N="233" REF="236"> which once more elevated the hopes of the de&s;pairing
garri&s;on. The General now flattered him&s;elf with the hope of being
&s;upplied with provi&s;ions; and, once more, animated his &s;oldiers, long
&s;unk with di&s;ea&s;e, famine, fatigue, and uninterrupted adver&s;ity. He
immediately wrote to one of the French re&s;idents at a Dutch &s;ettlement
&s;or in&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance; his eager impatience appears in the letter he
&s;ent. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>The Engli&s;h &s;quadron is no more, Sir. Of the
twelve &s;hips they had in our road, &s;even are lo&s;t, crews and all; the
other four di&s;|ma&s;ted, and no more than one frigate hath
e&s;caped&mdash;lo&s;e not an in&s;tant in &s;ending boats after boats loaded
with rice.&mdash;The &s;aving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once
already; this opportunity neglected, the fault will be all yours. Offer great
rewards.&mdash;In four days I expect &s;even|teen thou&s;and
Morattoes.&mdash;In &s;hort, ri&s;que all, attempt all, force all, and &s;end
us &s;ome rice, &s;hould it be but half a gar&s;e at a time.</HI></Q> This
&s;ingular letter, however, was inter|cepted; and, in le&s;s than four days, he
had the mor|tification to behold Admiral Stevens again appearing in the
harbour, who had repaired his lo&s;&s;es with all po&s;&s;ible celerity; and
the blockade now became as complete as ever. Still, however, he made no
pro|po&s;al to &s;urrender; the &s;iege was carried on by his countryman with
redoubled alacrity; and, at length, he found his troops half con&s;umed with
fatigue and famine, a breach made in the rampart, and not more than one day's
provi&s;ion of any kind remain|ing. He was now reduced to an extremity that
would admit of no he&s;itation; a &s;ignal was therefore made to cea&s;e
ho&s;tilities; the principal of the Je&s;uits, together with two civilians,
came out, and offered terms of capitulation. Lally, however, could not be
prevailed upon to offer any terms; he &s;ent a pa|per, filled with reproaches,
again&s;t the Engli&s;h, to Colonel Coote; and alledged, that he would not
treat with an enemy upon the honourable terms of war, who had already forfeited
his honour in &s;eve|ral <PB N="234" REF="237"> in&s;tances. He therefore
&s;uffered the Engli&s;h troops to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, but
refu&s;ed to &s;urrender it in the u&s;ual forms. This conque&s;t ter|minated
the power of France in India; the whole trade of that va&s;t penin&s;ula, from
the Indus to the Ganges, became our own. The Princes of the coun|try knew the
Engli&s;h force, and learned to fear it. Since that time nothing con&s;iderable
has been done again&s;t us. Our Ea&s;t-India company have become the arbiters
of Empire. The Mogul him&s;elf has been defeated, and taken pri&s;oner. The
Briti&s;h Em|pire begins to vie even with that of ancient Rome; the extent of
its dominions on land is as wide, and its force at &s;ea is infinitely greater.
Happy if we know when to bound our &s;ucce&s;&s;es; happy if we can
di&s;tingui&s;h between victories and advantages; if we can be convinced that
when a nation &s;hines brighte&s;t with conque&s;t, it may then, like a
wa&s;ting taper, be only ha&s;tening to decay.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>VICTORY, which thus fir&s;t dawned upon us, from the Ea&s;t,
&s;eemed to extend even to Eu|rope and America. But &s;ome &s;teps led to
the&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es which had been long wi&s;hed for; and, at length, were
effected. The affairs of war were di|rected by a mini&s;try which &s;eemed
utterly unequal to the weight and importance of &s;uch a charge; they were but
feebly held together among each other, and clamoured again&s;t by the united
voice of the people. It had long been their method to rule by party; and,
&s;urrounding the throne, it was &s;aid, they attempted only to fill the royal
ear with whatever &s;ugge&s;tions they thought mo&s;t to their intere&s;ts.
When any <PB N="235" REF="238"> new mea&s;ure was propo&s;ed, which could not
receive their approbation; or any new member was introduced into government,
whom they did not nominate, it was their method to throw up their places with a
&s;e|cret view of re&s;uming them with greater lu&s;tre. Thus all hope of
preferment was to be expected only from them; public favours were conferred
only for private &s;ervices; they were thought to govern in the &s;enate and in
the field; the &s;trength of the crown was actu|ally declining; that of the
people was &s;carce any, while ari&s;tocracy filled up every avenue to the
throne with pride, ignorance, and faction.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the King and nation, at that time, was truly
deplorable; the defeat of Braddock in Ame|rica; the lo&s;s of O&s;wego; the
delay of armaments; the ab&s;urd de&s;tination of fleets and armies, all
&s;erved to reduce the people almo&s;t to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, and
brought addre&s;&s;es to the throne from every part of the kingdom. The general
voice was, at length, too loud not to reach the throne; and the mini&s;try
were, at length, obliged to admit &s;ome gentlemen into a &s;hare of the
government, who&s;e talents and integrity might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
counterbalance their own deficience. At the head of the&s;e newly introduced
were Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge; the for|mer of the&s;e was appointed Secretary of
State, the other Chancellor of the Exchequer. To draw the characters of men
&s;till living, would nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub|ject me to the imputation of
adulation or &s;atyr; it is enough to &s;ay, that the people had high
expectations from their abilities; and, in the end, they were not
di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of the nation, however, was but of &s;hort
continuance; a mini&s;try compo&s;ed of &s;uch jar|ring principles could not
long continue united, being con&s;tituted of per&s;ons e&s;pou&s;ing different
mea&s;ures, and actuated by different motives. The old juncto courted the
Sovereign's favour by their pretended at|tachment <PB N="236" REF="239"> to his
foreign dominions; the new cla|moured again&s;t all continental connexions as
ut|terly incompatible with the intere&s;t of the nation. Both, perhaps, might
have been wrong; but it is obvious, that the&s;e &s;entiments were &s;ufficient
to &s;ink the latter in the royal e&s;teem; and this di&s;like was artfully
kept up, and increa&s;ed by their old rivals in power. A few months, therefore,
after Mr. Pitt had been put into office, he was obliged to re&s;ign the
&s;eals, by his Maje&s;ty's command; and Mr. Legge was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
being Chancellor of the Exche|quer. The old mini&s;try now thought them&s;elves
&s;ecure in the unmole&s;ted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of former power; but this very
&s;tep which they took for their own &s;e|curity turned out to them as
unfortunate as tho&s;e they planned for the public were un&s;ucce&s;sful. The
whole nation &s;eemed to ri&s;e up as one man in vindi|cation of that part of
the mini&s;try that was lately excluded. And the King, at length, thought
pro|per to comply with the general &s;olicitation. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge were
again re&s;tored, and a train of &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;oon began to dignify their
de&s;igns.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, however, the mea&s;ures planned by the former
mini&s;try were pur&s;ued in America; and though the Engli&s;h were &s;uperior
to the enemy, yet &s;till they felt all the inconvenience of irre&s;olute
coun|cils and ill-planned operations. Our women and children in that part of
the world were expo&s;ed to the unparalleled cruelty of the Indian &s;avages;
and, what is &s;till more remarkable, two thou&s;and Britons with arms in their
hands, continued tame &s;pectators of the&s;e inhumanities. Bad &s;ucce&s;s
ever produces complaint on all &s;ides; and England now heard no|thing but
invective and accu&s;ation. The Generals &s;ent over to manage the operations
of war, loudly accu&s;ed the timidity and the &s;lowne&s;s of the natives, who
were to unite in their own defence; the natives, on the contrary, as warmly
expo&s;tulated again&s;t the <PB N="237" REF="240"> pride, avarice, or
incapacity of tho&s;e &s;ent over to command them. General Shirley, who was
appoint|ed to that command, had been &s;uper&s;eded by Lord London; and this
nobleman &s;oon after returning to England, three &s;everal commanders were put
at the head of &s;eparate operations; the mo&s;t important be|ing that
de&s;igned again&s;t Cape Breton, was com|manded by General Amher&s;t. The
taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land, and its fortre&s;s, was a
conque&s;t great|ly wi&s;hed by all our colonies, as it had always been a
convenient harbour to the enemy, which, from thence annoyed our trade with
impunity. It was al&s;o a convenient &s;ituation for carrying on their
fi&s;hery; a branch of commerce of the utmo&s;t bene|fit to the French nation.
The fortre&s;s of Loui&s;burg was &s;trengthened with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of art; the garri&s;on was numerous; the commander vigilant; and every
precaution taken to prevent a de&s;cent. An account of the operations of a
&s;iege is tedious; be it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h
&s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle with the mo&s;t amazing intrepidity; their former
timidity &s;eemed now converted into per&s;ever|ing re&s;olution; the place was
&s;urrendered by capitu|lation; and our troops, long u&s;ed to di&s;appointment
and repul&s;e began to boa&s;t of victory in their turn.</P>
<P>Two other operations were carried on in America at the &s;ame time,
the one under General Abercrom|bie, again&s;t Crown Point and Ticonderago; the
other, more to the &s;outhward, again&s;t fort Du Que&s;ne; the latter
expedition was &s;ucce&s;sful; but that again&s;t Crown Point and Ticonderago
was at|tended with its u&s;ual bad fortune. This was now the &s;econd time that
the Engli&s;h army had attempted to penetrate into tho&s;e hideous wilds by
which na|ture had &s;ecured the French encroachments in that remote part of
America; Braddock was fallen in the attempt; his ra&s;hne&s;s contributed to
his defeat; and too much caution, perhaps, was the fault of his
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. <PB N="238" REF="241"> Much time was &s;pent in marching to
the place of action; and the enemy were thus perfectly prepared to give the
Engli&s;h troops a warm reception. They were found intrenched under the fort of
Ti|conderago, behind a brea&s;t-work rai&s;ed eight feet high, and &s;till
farther &s;ecured by felled trees, with their branches pointing outwards.
The&s;e difficul|ties, however, the Engli&s;h attempted to &s;urmount; but as
the enemy, being &s;ecure them&s;elves, took aim at lei&s;ure; a terrible
carnage of the a&s;&s;ailants en&s;ued, and the General, after repeated
efforts, was obliged to order a retreat. The Engli&s;h army, however, was
&s;till &s;uperior to that of the enemy, and might, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, have
gone onward with &s;ucce&s;s, if &s;upport|ed by their artillery, which had not
yet arrived; but the General felt, too &s;en&s;ibly, the terrors of the late
defeat, to remain in the vicinity of a victorious ene|my; he therefore
reimbarked his troops, and returned to his camp at Lake George, from whence he
had taken his departure.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, however, was, upon the whole,
greatly in favour of the Engli&s;h. The taking of fort Du Que&s;ne &s;erved to
remove from our colonies the terror of the incur&s;ions of barbarians, and
interrupted that continued corre&s;pondence, which by a chain of forts, one
part of the French &s;ettle|ments had with the other. The mini&s;try too
di&s;co|vered a &s;pirit of vigorous re&s;olution hitherto unknown, in this
part of the world; and the next campaign promi&s;ed more brilliant
&s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in the opening of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1759, the
mini&s;try &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible that a &s;ingle ef|fort carried in &s;uch wide
extended dominions, would never bring the enemy into &s;ubjection; it was
there|fore re&s;olved to attack them in &s;everal different parts of this
exten&s;ive Empire at once. It was therefore pro|po&s;ed to attack the French
in all their places of &s;trength at the &s;ame time Preparations were
therefore made, <PB N="239" REF="242"> and expeditions went forward again&s;t
three different parts of the northern continent of America. Gene|ral Amher&s;t,
commander in chief, with a body of twelve thou&s;and men, was to attack Crown
Point that had hitherto been the reproach of the Engli&s;h army. General Wolfe
was, at the oppo&s;ite quarter, to enter the river St. Lawrence, and undertake
the &s;iege of Quebec, the capital of the French dominions in this part of the
world, while General Prideaux and Sir William John&s;on were to attempt a fort
near the cataract of Niagara. This la&s;t expedition was the fir&s;t
&s;ucce&s;sful. The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance, and
&s;erved to command all the communication between the northern and we&s;tern
French &s;ettlements. The &s;iege was &s;oon commenced by the Engli&s;h, but
General Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bur&s;ting of a cohorn; &s;o
that the whole &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition fell to General John|&s;on, and
his good fortune. He omitted nothing to promote the vigorous mea&s;ures of his
predece&s;&s;or, but added all his own popularity. The French knew the
importance of this fort, and attempted to relieve it. John&s;on attacked them
with his u&s;ual intrepidity and &s;ucce&s;s; in le&s;s than an hour their
whole army was put to the route, and the garri&s;on, beholding the de|feat of
their countrymen, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war. Nor was General Amher&s;t
le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, though, without meeting an enemy, upon his march to
Crown Point, he found both that fort and Ticon|derago de&s;erted and
de&s;troyed. There now, there|fore, remained but one grand and deci&s;ive blow
to put all North America in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. This was the
taking of Quebec, a city hand&s;omely built, populous, and flouri&s;hing.
Admiral Saunders commanded the naval part of the expedition; that by land was
committed to the conduct of General Wolfe. This young &s;oldier, who was not
yet thirty-five, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on many former occa&s;ions,
par|ticularly <PB N="240" REF="243"> in the &s;iege of Loui&s;burg, a part of
the &s;uc|ce&s;s of which was ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to him, who, unin debted to
family or connexions had rai&s;ed him&s;elf by merit to his pre&s;ent command.
The war in this part of the world had hitherto been carried on with ex|treme
barbarity; and each &s;ide &s;eemed to have adopt|ed the &s;avage manners of
the Indians, who&s;e country they di&s;puted. Wolfe, however, di&s;dained
the&s;e ba&s;e proceedings, and carried on all the terrors of war with the
humanity of a truly civilized European. A de&s;cription of the &s;iege of this
city may in&s;truct a &s;oldier, but can &s;carcely inform a citizen; be it
&s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve, that its beginning appeared ex|tremely
unpromi&s;ing to the be&s;iegers; and repeated repul&s;es even &s;erved to
abate the hopes of the com|mander. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I know,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that the affairs of
Great Britain require the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures; but then the courage of
an handful of brave men &s;hould be exerted only where there is &s;ome hope of
a favourable event. At pre|&s;ent the difficulties are &s;o various that I am
at a lo&s;s how to determine.</HI></Q> However, he re&s;olved, though now
&s;inking under fatigue and &s;ickne&s;s, to make one vi|gorous attempt before
he gave up all; and accord|ingly, in the night, part of his troops, with great
difficulty made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of an hill that commanded the town. A
battle en&s;ued; Montcalm, the French commander, re&s;olved not to &s;urvive
the defeat of his country. Wolfe, on the other &s;ide, re|&s;olved to conquer
or die. Both commanders had their wi&s;h; both fell; but the Engli&s;h were
victorious. The circum&s;tances attending the death of Wolfe &s;erved to give
an example like that of the noble The|ban. He, in the beginning of the
engagement, re|ceived a wound in the hand, which he di&s;&s;embled, wrapping it
round with his handkerchief, to &s;top the effu&s;ion of blood; he advanced
with uncon|cern: a &s;econd ball, was more fatal; it pierced his brea&s;t, &s;o
that, unable to proceed, he leaned on the <PB N="241" REF="244"> &s;houlder of
a &s;oldier who was near him. Now, &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and
ju&s;t depart|ing, he heard a voice cry, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>they run;</HI></Q> he &s;eemed to revive a
moment at the &s;ound, and, a&s;king who ran, was informed the <HI>French;</HI>
expre&s;&s;ing his wonder that they ran &s;o &s;oon, and unable to gaze any
longer, he &s;unk on the &s;oldier's brea&s;t, and his la&s;t words were, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I die happy.</HI></Q> Perhaps the lo&s;s of
&s;uch a man was greater to the nation than the conquering of all Ca|nada was
advantageous; but it is the misfortune of humanity, that we can never know true
greatne&s;s till that moment when we are going to lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>The &s;urrender of the city was the con&s;equence of this victory,
and, with it, the total ce&s;&s;ion of all Canada. The French, it is true,
made, in the en|&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, a vigorous effort to retake it; but, by the
good conduct of our Governour, the town held out till relieved by an Engli&s;h
fleet, under the com|mand of Lord Colville. Thus did this campaign make ample
reparation for all the lo&s;&s;es that had been hitherto &s;u&s;tained by the
Engli&s;h. The French had now no force capable of making any re&s;i&s;tance;
they held out the war now, not with hopes of victory, but honourable
capitulation; one place after another was invaded; Montreal, at la&s;t,
&s;urrendered; and, in a &s;hort time, a country, which their own writers have
repre&s;ented as being more exten&s;ive than the Roman Empire, fell totally
under the power of his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>How far the extending dominion tends to the in|crea&s;ing the
&s;trength of a nation, is an object worthy con&s;ideration. The &s;plendour of
victory &s;hould never dazzle the eye of rea&s;on. No people ever could call
their country powerful, if it were not populous. For political force depends
upon the &s;mall frontier to be defended; and the vicinity of an army to every
place to be invaded; but extended Empire takes away both the&s;e advantages,
and, before the &s;oldier <PB N="242" REF="245"> can traver&s;e half his proper
territories, his country may have already felt all the horrors of inva&s;ion.
Whatever joy therefore our country might have felt at the&s;e immen&s;e
acqui&s;itions, of remote territory, I own it gives me no very plea&s;ing
pro&s;pect. The manufactures, the trade, and the riches of the&s;e di|&s;tant
countries, can never recompence for the conti|nual drain of u&s;eful and
indu&s;trious &s;ubjects, that mu&s;t be derived from the mother country to
people them. Wherever the lower &s;ort of people in any kingdom can fly from
labour, they will be ready to go; yet, upon the indu&s;try, and the valour of
the&s;e alone, every kingdom mu&s;t hope for &s;ecurity. Not the effeminate,
and the luxurious, can defend their country in the day of battle; they may
increa&s;e ti|midity by their example, but opulence can never give true relief.
The Spaniards and the Portugue&s;e were much more powerful before they divided
their &s;trength into all the torrid climates of Southern America. The &s;tate
thus got riches, but lo&s;t men; they had gold, but could not regain
indu&s;try. Thus are their nations now incapable of defending them|&s;elves
again&s;t powerful foreign inva&s;ion. The im|men&s;e wealth of the Indies that
every year comes home to their ports goes to inrich a few; their &s;ub|jects
are either in the extremes of wealth or poverty; the rich have only &s;laves
beneath them, who hate tho&s;e for whom they mu&s;t labour; the poor have no
acqui&s;itions, nor property, to defend; &s;o that their armies are compo&s;ed
either of wretches pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, who only &s;eek for
opportunities not to fight, but to fly; or of men, rich and noble, courageous
from pride, yet weak from luxury. Such is not, as yet, the ca&s;e of England,
nor will ever be, if a pa&s;&s;ion for conque&s;t is not mi&s;taken for
national pro&s;perity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of our arms in America was at|chieved by moderate
efforts; on the contrary, in Europe the efforts we made, and the operations of
our great ally the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, were a&s;toni&s;h|ing, yet produced no
very &s;ignal effects. Safety was all that could be expected; and this was
&s;ecured con|trary to all human expectation. You have ju&s;t &s;een that
Monarch &s;urrounded by enemies; the greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable powers of
Europe; you have &s;een almo&s;t the whole power of the continent united
again&s;t, and hovering over, his devoted dominions; and the only allies that
remained to him bound by treaty to retire, and give him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In
this terrible &s;ituation he &s;till adhered to his fortitude, and, relying on
his natural &s;ubjects alone, re&s;olved never to abandon his claims. Such was
the de&s;perate condition of his affairs; yet they were &s;till rendered more
hopele&s;s, when he was informed that his only friend, the Monarch of that
generous people which had hitherto &s;upplied him with money and &s;tores, was
going to for&s;ake him, and leave him to irreme|diable ruin. It was thus he
expo&s;tulated with the doubting Monarch upon this occa&s;ion: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible that your Maje&s;ty can have
&s;o little fortitude and con&s;tancy, as to be di&s;pirited by a &s;mall
rever&s;e of fortune. Are our affairs &s;o ruinous that they cannot be
repaired? Con&s;ider the &s;tep you have made me undertake, and remember that
you are the cau&s;e of all my misfortunes. I &s;hould never have abandoned my
former alliances but for your flattering a&s;&s;urances. I do not now repent of
the treaty concluded between us; but I intreat you will not ingloriou&s;ly
leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the
powers of Europe.</HI></Q> The French and Imperiali&s;ts, after a
&s;ucce&s;sful &s;um|mer campaign, were, at this time, which was the depth of
winter, &s;at down to the &s;iege of Leip&s;ic. His Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty
dreaded the capture of this important <PB N="244" REF="247"> city, and &s;oon,
unexpectedly, &s;eemed to ri&s;e up before it. Such was the terror of his arms,
even vanqui&s;h|ed as he had been, that his approach rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and
the French, though &s;uperior in number, retreat|ed. He, at length, overtook
them at a village called Ro&s;bach, and gained &s;o complete a victory, that
night alone &s;aved their whole army from de&s;truction. The Au&s;trians were,
in another part of the Empire, &s;till victorious, and had taken the Prince of
Bevern, his generali&s;&s;imo, pri&s;oner. The King, after a dreadful march of
two hundred miles, in the depth of win|ter, came up with them near Bre&s;lau,
di&s;po&s;ed his inferior forces with his u&s;ual judgment, and obtained
another bloody victory, in which he took not le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and
pri&s;oners. Bre&s;lau, with a gar|ri&s;on of ten thou&s;and men, &s;urrendered
&s;oon after, The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es di&s;pirited the enemy, and rai&s;ed his
allies to new hopes.</P>
<P>After the capitulation of Clo&s;ter-Severn was &s;ign|ed, between
the Duke of Cumberland and the Duke of Richelieu, both &s;ides began to
complain of in|fractions. The Hanoverians accu&s;ed the rapacity of the French
General, and the in&s;olent brutality of his &s;oldiers; while the French
retorted the charge of in&s;urrection again&s;t them, and began to think of
treat|ing as a conquered enemy tho&s;e whom they had only bound by treaty as
neutrals. Treaties have never been pre&s;erved longer than intere&s;t or
compul&s;ion bound them; political faith is a word without mean|ing; the French
oppre&s;&s;ed the Hanoverians; the lat|ter re&s;umed their arms; and each
&s;ide complained, as u&s;ual, of infraction. A General was not long want|ing
to a&s;&s;emble the collecting army. Prince Ferdi|nand of Brun&s;wic put
him&s;elf at their head, began by &s;kirmi&s;hing with &s;ucce&s;s; and, at
la&s;t, were in a capacity of becoming formidable to their late victors. From
this time the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ought the enemy upon more equal terms than
ever; often victorious, <PB N="245" REF="248"> &s;ometimes repul&s;ed; but ever
active and formidable. To name his victories, the towns he took, the dan|gers
he e&s;caped, and the lo&s;&s;es he &s;uffered, would take up more time than I
would chu&s;e to grant to &s;uch accounts, or you &s;hould be&s;tow. Never was
the art of war carried to &s;uch a pitch as by him. In this war Europe &s;aw,
with a&s;toni&s;hment, campaigns carried on in the mid&s;t of winter; great and
bloody battles fought, yet producing no vi&s;ible advantage to the victors. At
no time, &s;ince the days of heroi&s;m, were &s;uch numbers de&s;troyed, &s;o
many towns taken, &s;o many &s;kirmi&s;hes fought, &s;uch &s;tratagems
prac|ti&s;ed, or &s;uch intrepidity &s;hewn. Armies now were con&s;idered as
compo&s;ing one &s;ingle machine, directed by the General, and animated with
one will. From the commentary of the&s;e campaigns, &s;ucceeding Ge|nerals will
take their le&s;&s;ons for deva&s;tation, and im|prove in the arts of
increa&s;ing human calamity.</P>
<P>England was, all this time, happily retired from the calamities
which drenched the re&s;t of Europe in blood; yet, from her natural military
eagerne&s;s, &s;eemed de&s;irous of &s;haring tho&s;e dangers of which &s;he
was only a &s;pectator. This pa&s;&s;ion for carrying on a continental war, was
not le&s;s plea&s;ing to the Monarch from his native attachments, than to the
people from their natural propen&s;ity to arms. As &s;oon as it was known that
Prince Ferdinand had put him&s;elf at the head of the Hanoverian army, his
Britannic Maje&s;ty, in a &s;peech at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament, ob&s;erved, that the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Germany had given an
happy turn to his affairs, which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to improve. The
com|mons therefore granted liberal &s;upplies both for the &s;ervice of the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and for enabling the army formed in the Electorate of
Hanover, to act vigorou&s;ly in conjunction with him. Soon after it was
con&s;idered, that men would be a more grateful <PB N="246" REF="249"> &s;upply
than money. The mini&s;ter who had fir&s;t come into power and popularity, by
oppo&s;ing &s;uch mea&s;ures, was now prevailed upon to enter into them with
even greater ardour than any of his predece&s;&s;ors. The hopes of putting a
&s;peedy end to this war, by vigorous mea&s;ures, his connexions, and, perhaps,
the plea&s;ure he found in giving his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ure, incited him eagerly
into a continental war. It is certain, no mini&s;ter could more powerfully
&s;econd a warlike Monarch's intentions; that &s;pirit of enter|prize which
had, in a mea&s;ure, taken birth with his admini&s;tration, he could now direct
at will. The pa&s;&s;ion for military honour &s;eemed diffu&s;ed through all
ranks of people; and it only wanted a channel in which to flow. In order to
indulge this general in|clination, the Duke of Marlborough was &s;ent into
Germany with a &s;mall body of Briti&s;h forces to a&s;&s;i&s;t Prince
Ferdinand, where they behaved with bravery, and con&s;pired in promoting that
Prince's &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Each victory they gained, however, only &s;erved as a
pretext to call over new forces from Britain, while the Engli&s;h mini&s;try
were taught to believe that every la&s;t battle would be deci&s;ive. The battle
of Crevelt was fought, in which the Hanoverians and Engli&s;h had the
advantage; but it produced no ef|fect. The victory of Minden followed; but
laurels &s;eemed to be all that England reaped from the con|quered field. After
the&s;e two victories it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that one reinforcement more of
Briti&s;h forces would terminate the war in our favour; a reinforcement was
therefore &s;ent. The Briti&s;h troops in Germany now amounted to above thirty
thou&s;and men, yet no advantage of any con&s;equence was the re&s;ult of this
formidable a&s;&s;i&s;tance. War was the trade of &s;ome Generals, and, it
mu&s;t be allowed, a gainful trade it was. Let me therefore, here again, pa&s;s
over this continued repetition of marchings, &s;kirmi&s;hes, and 
<PB N="247" REF="250"> rencounters, nor load the page with names of Ger|man
Generals, too difficult to be pronounced by an Engli&s;h tongue, and equally
grating to a patriot ear. The victories of either &s;ide might, in fact, be
con|&s;idered as a compact by which &s;omething was to be lo&s;t on either
&s;ide, and no advantage to be acquired. The Engli&s;h, at length, began to
open their eyes to their own intere&s;t; nor could all the &s;plendours of
victory &s;o far blind them, as not to &s;ee that they were waging unequal war,
and a&s;&s;uming new loads of taxes for conque&s;ts they could neither
pre&s;erve nor enjoy. Such were the growing di&s;contents of the people, when
the King, who had in&s;pired the&s;e mea&s;ures, unexpectedly died. On the
twenty-fifth day of October, George II, without any previous di&s;order, was
found by his dome&s;tic &s;ervants, expiring in his chamber. He had ari&s;en at
his u&s;ual hour, and ob&s;erved to his attendants, that as the weather was
fine, he would walk out. In a few minutes af|ter this, being left alone, he was
heard to fall down upon the floor. The noi&s;e of his fall brought his
attendants into the room, who lifted him into bed, where he de&s;ired, in a
faint voice, that the Prince&s;s Amelia might be &s;ent for; but before her
arrival he expired. George II. died in the 77^t^h year of his age, and the 33^d
of his reign, in the mid&s;t of victory; and, at that very period, when the
univer|&s;al enthu&s;ia&s;m of conque&s;t began to &s;ub&s;ide for more &s;ober
reflexions. If any Monarch was happy in the peculiar mode and time of his
death, it was he. The factions which had been nur&s;ing in his reign, had not
yet come to maturity; and all their virulence threat|ened to fall upon his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. He was him&s;elf of no &s;hining abilities; and,
con&s;equently, while he was &s;uffered to guide his German dominions, he
entru&s;ted the care of Britain to his mini&s;ters at home. How|ever, as we
&s;tand too near this Monarch to view his <PB N="248" REF="251"> real character
without partiality, take the following characters of him, by two writers of
oppo&s;ite &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"> "As to the extent of his under&s;tanding (&s;ays
one) or the &s;plendour of his virtue, we rather wi&s;h for opportunities of
prai&s;ing, than undertake the ta&s;k our&s;elves. His public character was
marked with a predilection for his native country, to which he &s;acrificed all
other motives."</Q></P>
<P> On the other hand, &s;ays his panegyri&s;t, 
<Q REND="inline">"On whatever &s;ide we look upon his character, we
&s;hall find ample matter for ju&s;t and un&s;u&s;pected prai&s;e. None of his
predece&s;&s;ors in the throne of England lived to &s;o great an age, or
enjoyed longer felicity. His &s;ubjects were &s;till improving under him in
commerce and arts; and his own oeconomy &s;et a prudent example to the nation,
which, however, they did not follow. He was, in his temper, &s;udden and
violent; but this, though it influenced his behaviour, made no change in his
conduct, which was generally guid|ed by rea&s;on. He was plain and direct in
his in|tentions, true to his word, &s;teady in his favour and protection to his
&s;ervants; nor parting even with his mini&s;ters till compelled to it by the
vio|lence of faction. In &s;hort, through the whole of life he appeared rather
to live for the cultivation of u&s;eful virtues than &s;plendid ones; and,
&s;atisfied with being good, left others their unenvied great|ne&s;s."</Q></P>

<P>I Am &s;orry that prai&s;e be&s;towed on living merit is often found
to injure the goodne&s;s it applauds. The character of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of
George the &s;econd de&s;erves the warme&s;t panegyric; and all who love their
country only wi&s;h for a continuance of that &s;pirit, and that virtue which
has hitherto appeared in him. Never did Monarch come to the throne at a more
critical period; the nation, flu&s;hed with con|que&s;t, yet tired of war;
expecting the lowe&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion from their humbled enemies, yet
murmuring under the immen&s;e load of their taxes. One part of the people
acquiring immen&s;e wealth by the conti|nuance of ho&s;tilities; another
reduced almo&s;t to bank|ruptcy. Be&s;ides this, he &s;aw the throne hedged
round by ignorance and faction, men intent only on their own intere&s;ts, and
willing to per&s;uade Monarchy that whatever conduced to their own wi&s;hes was
di|rected for the welfare of the kingdom. It was in this di&s;po&s;ition of
things, that George III. came to the crown. The kingdom began to divide into
two parties; or, more properly &s;peaking, the very &s;ame individuals &s;eemed
to wear, at once, a face of joy and di&s;content. They felt all the triumphs of
their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, but ju&s;tly dreaded the con&s;equences of an
expen&s;ive continuance of them. The numberle&s;s victo|ries they gained by
&s;ea continued to keep them in &s;pirits, and induced them to &s;upply the
immen&s;e ex|pences of the year with chearfulne&s;s. During the whole period of
the war &s;ucceeding the execution of Admiral Byng, nothing could be carried on
with more &s;pirit and re&s;olution, than all our naval engage|ments. In every
enterprize the &s;uperior bravery, &s;kill, and dexterity of the Engli&s;h were
obvious. Often with forces very much di&s;proportioned, they 
<PB N="250" REF="253"> took their adver&s;aries &s;hips, and effectually
di&s;abled the enemies force by &s;ea.</P>
<P>No hi&s;tory can furni&s;h examples of &s;uch numerous fleets, or
more active commanders. This de&s;ire for victory &s;eemed even to diffu&s;e
it&s;elf to the lowe&s;t officers; and the captains of privateers &s;eemed as
much enamoured of conque&s;t as with a de&s;ire of gain. The Admirals, Hawke,
Howe, Bo&s;cawen, Pocock, &amp;c. were always victorious; the Captains, Tyrrel,
Fo&s;ter, Gilchri&s;t, Lockhart, and others, often fought at a di&s;advantage,
but never without honour. As an in&s;tance of the intrepid &s;pirit of our
&s;eamen in this war, I &s;hall mention one action which po&s;terity, if it
were only &s;ingly &s;upported, might look upon as incredible. The annals of
mankind cannot &s;hew an effort of more de&s;perate courage than was exerted
under the command of captain William Death, commander of the Terrible
privateer. He had, in the beginning of his cruize, made prize of a rich
merchant-&s;hip, and with this was returning home to England in triumph, when
he had the misfortune to fall in with the Ven|geance privateer of St. Malo,
much his &s;uperior in force, he having but twenty-&s;ix guns, the enemy
thirty-&s;ix, and a proportionable number of men. The Terrible's prize was
&s;oon taken, and converted again&s;t her; but, though &s;o unequally matched,
cap|tain Death maintained a furious engagement that cannot be paralleled in the
annals of any country. The French commander and his &s;econd were killed, with
two thirds of his company; but much more dreadful was the &s;laughter on board
the Terrible. When the enemy boarded it, they only found one &s;cene of
&s;laughter, &s;ilence, and de&s;olation. Of two hundred men only &s;ixteen
were found remaining, and the &s;hip it&s;elf &s;o &s;hattered as &s;carcely to
be kept above water.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254"> Such were the dear-bought naval victories of
France; and &s;uch was the ob&s;tinacy of the Engli&s;h, even when defeated,
that the court of Ver&s;ailles, at length, &s;eemed to demand peace at any
rate. To this reque&s;t the Engli&s;h were ready to accede, and
Plenipotentiaries were &s;ent from either court to ne|gociate &s;o wi&s;hed-for
a reconciliation. France &s;ent to London Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, a man rather &s;killed
in the arts of negotiation than the open integrity becoming the mini&s;ter of a
great nation. England &s;ent over, in exchange, Mr. Stanley, to Paris.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to be a fundamental principle in this treaty, which,
however, proved ineffectual, that each country was to be con&s;idered as
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their re|&s;pective conque&s;ts; and that if any &s;uch
were to be given up on one &s;ide, it was to be only in exchange for &s;uch as
had been made by the other. Upon the&s;e terms it is obvious, that the
Engli&s;h were likely to be great gainers by a treaty, as they had taken
&s;eve|ral places and dominions from the French, and had lo&s;t only Minorca.
Whether the French had a real de&s;ire to proceed upon &s;uch terms is
uncertain; however, they &s;oon gave the Engli&s;h mini&s;try &s;uffi|cient
rea&s;ons to be di&s;&s;atisfied with their proceedings. Mr. Pitt, who had for
a long time been &s;ucce&s;sful, actuated all the Engli&s;h mea&s;ures, and
guided their councils, had ever di&s;dained that pedantry of po|litical
refinement, of which others &s;o vainly boa&s;t|ed; he negociated therefore in
a plain &s;imple man|ner; his guide, &s;incerity; and his only object, his
country's good. Several points were agreed upon between each nation, that gave
great hopes that an ac|commodation might &s;peedily be the re&s;ult. The French
agreed to give up all Canada, a fort upon the river Senegal in Africa, and to
re&s;tore Minorca. The chief objects in debate were, the privilege they claimed
of continuing to fi&s;h upon the Banks of Newfoundland, and of having the
damages repaired which they <PB N="252" REF="255"> &s;u&s;tained by the taking
of their &s;hipping before a de|claration of war. The&s;e two points were
warmly negotiated on either &s;ide, not without hopes of &s;peedy adju&s;tment,
when, unexpectedly, the whole treaty was, at once, &s;et a&s;ide by the
interpo&s;ition of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, who de&s;ired to have the
intere&s;ts of Spain al&s;o included in the treaty. Mr. Pitt very ju&s;tly
con|&s;idered, that as Spain had no part in the war, &s;o it was impertinent in
that power to intermeddle in a treaty of peace; and he regarded this
interpo&s;ition in its true light, namely, that of a confederacy be|tween
France and Spain mutually to &s;upport each other's intere&s;t. Confident
therefore of his own in|tegrity, and, perhaps, al&s;o too much elated by
popu|lar applau&s;e, he began to treat the French negotiator with a great
&s;hare of haughtine&s;s, of which he com|plained to his court at home; and he
was &s;oon re|called.</P>
<P>This conduct of Mr. Pitt might have ju&s;tly in|curred reproach, had
he had no private intimations of a &s;ecret alliance between France and Spain.
The la&s;t named power had actually entered into a family compact with France,
by which they engaged to car|ry on a war in conjunction. Of all this the
Engli&s;h &s;ecretary had been previou&s;ly apprized, and propo&s;ed in the
privy council to anticipate the de&s;igns of Spain by an immediate declaration
of war again&s;t her. Vi|gour, di&s;patch, and re&s;olution, characterized all
the plans of this mini&s;ter; he found, however, in the privy council men who
were willing to act with more deliberation, and who de&s;ired a certainty of
offence before they demanded a reparation. Spain, they &s;aid, has yet given no
certain proofs of their ho&s;tile inten|tions; and the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at
the court of Ma|drid &s;till continues to a&s;&s;ure us of their pacific
inten|tions. The&s;e remon&s;trances were an&s;wered by the &s;ecretary, but
without producing the de&s;ired convic|tion; &s;eeing him&s;elf therefore
almo&s;t &s;ingular in his <PB N="253" REF="256"> opinion, he was re&s;olved to
leave an a&s;&s;embly wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> he knew
him&s;elf maligned; and he threw up the di+rection of mea&s;ures, which, to
u&s;e his own expre&s;|&s;ion, he was no longer allowed to guide. The council
was, at that time, divided between two parties, who were both equally plea&s;ed
at his re&s;ig|nation. One part con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e who were at the head
of affairs during the preceding reign; the other &s;uch as had been taken into
favour in this; neither were di&s;plea&s;ed at the removal of a man who&s;e
po|pularity threw them into the &s;hade, and who&s;e ve|hemence controlled
their moderation. But this po|pular mini&s;ter's being removed, did not
re&s;tore una|nimity to the council. The parts which were held together by his
pre&s;ence, now di&s;united, and a di&s;|&s;ention began, which &s;till
continues to &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The declaration of war with Spain, &s;oon after, &s;hewed how
well-grounded Mr. Pitt's mea&s;ures were, when he propo&s;ed a former rupture.
However, the union of France and Spain, and the di&s;union of our own
mini&s;try at home, did not &s;eem to retard the progre&s;s of our arms. The
i&s;land of Martinico was conquered by Admiral Rodney and General Monck|ton;
the i&s;land of St. Lucia &s;urrendered &s;oon after to Captain Harvey; Granada
was taken by Briga|dier Wal&s;h; and all the neutral i&s;lands &s;ubmitted to
the Engli&s;h dominion. But a bolder blow was &s;truck again&s;t the Spaniards;
a powerful fleet, and an army of fifteen thou&s;and men, was &s;ent again&s;t
the Havan|nah, the key of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in South Ame|rica. It
made a noble re&s;i&s;tance; but in the end was taken. And now the enemies of
Great Britain were humbled on every &s;ide; the French left with|out trade or
&s;hipping; the &s;ource of Spani&s;h oppu|lence interrupted; nothing remained
for them, but to a&s;k for peace, upon &s;uch terms as we were plea&s;ed to
grant. A negociation was accordingly once more begun between the three powers,
by the intervention <PB N="254" REF="257"> of the King of Sardinia's
Amba&s;&s;ador; the Duke of Bedford was &s;ent over to Paris, and the Duke De
Nivernois came to London; and, at length, the definitive treaty was &s;igned at
Paris by the Duke of Bedford, the Duc De Pra&s;lin, and the Marquis De
Grimaldi, and arrived in London February 19, 1763. In order to purcha&s;e peace
the French gave up all Canada, their right to the neutral i&s;lands, the fort
of Senegal, and their right of fi&s;hing on the coa&s;ts of Newfoundland and
the gulph of St. Lawrence, but at a certain di&s;tance from &s;hore. Spain
al&s;o gave up, on her part, the exten&s;ive country of Florida; &s;o that the
Engli&s;h empire was thus greatly enlarged; and, if we compute its &s;trength
by the quantity of land included in its dominions, it can now boa&s;t more
power than even the great Roman empire.</P>
<P>But no country &s;hould build upon remote &s;trength; true power
mu&s;t always &s;ub&s;i&s;t at home. When the branches of a large empire become
more powerful than the original &s;tem, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting it's
growth, they only overload and exhau&s;t it nouri&s;hment. The di&s;contents,
therefore, which many have expre&s;&s;ed at the conclu&s;ion of the late peace,
that we did not in|&s;i&s;t upon harder terms, and increa&s;e our
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, were ill founded, &s;ince it is probable we are already
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than government can manage. There is ever a certain
extent of empire which po|litics are able to wield; beyond this her
magnificence is but empty pomp, and her &s;ize but corpulence.</P>
