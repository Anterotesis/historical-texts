<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I perceive by the tenor of your pub|lications, that you chiefly
aim at the im|provement of youth, if the following Letters are thought any-way
conducive to that pur|po&s;e, you have my permi&s;&s;ion to print them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t fifty-one letters ending with the&s;e words 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>&mdash;avenged them of their
enemies&mdash;</HI></Q>were written by a Nobleman to his &s;on, at the
uni|ver&s;ity. The re&s;t are added, as you will ea&s;ily perceive, by a much
inferior hand; for they were drawn up by me. This I &s;hould not have
attempted, but that the de&s;ign would otherwi&s;e have been defective. With
regard to my let|rers, therefore, little el&s;e can be &s;aid, but that I have
endeavoured, as much as was in my power, to imitate the original. As to his
Lord&s;hip's, I think it may be a&s;&s;erted, that they are written with more
judgment, &s;pirit, and accuracy than any which have yet appeared upon this
&s;ubject. I am con&s;cious, indeed, that they have been, for &s;ome time,
handed about in manu&s;cript; but, it is pre&s;umed that this will not make a
publication of them le&s;s acceptable, even to tho&s;e who are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a written copy.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved in the &s;chools about town, that, when
ma&s;ters &s;et their &s;cholars to read the hi&s;tory of England, they &s;eem
at a lo&s;s in <PB N="2" REF="3"> their choice of an hi&s;torian. The more
volu|minous works of this kind are quite un&s;uited to a juvenile capacity; the
&s;horter abridg|ments are chiefly a crouded collection of facts, totally dry
and unentertaining. The&s;e letters may, probably, &s;upply the defect; and I
de|&s;ire that the volumes may be &s;ent, at my ex|pence, to each of the
&s;chools mentioned in the inclo&s;ed paper.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE accounts I receive from Mr. your tutor, at Oxford, of your
con|duct and capacity, give me equal plea|&s;ure, both as a father and as a
man. I own my&s;elf happy, in thinking that &s;ociety will one day reap the
advantage of your improved abilities; but I confe&s;s my&s;elf vain when I
reflect on the care I have taken, and the honour I &s;hall perhaps obtain from
a&s;&s;i&s;ting their cultiva|tion. <PB N="2" REF="5"> Yes, my Charles,
&s;elf-intere&s;t thus mixes with almo&s;t every virtue; my paternal vanity is,
perhaps, greater than my regards for &s;ociety in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; but
you &s;hould con&s;ider that the bad pride them&s;elves in their folly, but
good minds alone are vain of their virtues.</P>
<P>I need &s;carcely repeat what I have &s;o often ob|&s;erved, that
your a&s;&s;iduity for a few years, in the early period of life, will give
ea&s;e and happine&s;s to the &s;ucceeding: a life &s;pent in regularity and
&s;tudy, in college, will not only furni&s;h the mind with proper materials,
but fit it, by habit, for future felicity. Mathematics will teach you to think
with clo&s;ene&s;s and preci&s;ion, and the ancient poets will enlarge the
imagination; from the&s;e two helps, and not from the &s;ubtleties of logic or
metaphy&s;i|cal &s;peculation, the mind is at once &s;trengthened and improved;
logic or metaphy&s;ics may give the theory of rea&s;oning, but it is poetry and
mathe|matics, though &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, that practically improve us in
every rational enquiry.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the &s;tudies I recommended as princi|pally conducive
to your improvement, and your letters alone are &s;ufficient in&s;tances of
your comply|ing with my advice. I confe&s;s I fear giving any future
in&s;tructions on &s;uch topics to one who &s;eems better conver&s;ant with
them than his in&s;tructor, and mu&s;t leave a &s;ubject, where my
&s;uperiority at lea&s;t may be conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>But after all, my child, the&s;e &s;tudies are at be&s;t but
ornaments of the mind, de&s;igned rather to po|li&s;h or to fit it for higher
improvements, than as materials to be employed in guiding our conduct as
individuals, or members of &s;ociety. There is a field that, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, &s;till lies untrodden before you, and from that alone true wi&s;dom
and <PB N="3" REF="6"> real improvement can be expected, I mean hi&s;to|ry:
from hi&s;tory, in a great mea&s;ure, every ad|vantage that improves the
gentleman, or confirms the patriot, can be hoped for; it is that which mu&s;t
qualify you for becoming a proper member of the community, for filling that
&s;tation, in which you may hereafter be placed, with honour; and for giving,
as well as deriving, new lu&s;tre from that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly, to
which, upon my de|cea&s;e, you have a right to be called.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;till, nothing can be more u&s;ele&s;s than hi&s;tory, in the
manner in which it is generally &s;tudied, where the memory is loaded with
little more than dates, names, and events. Simply to repeat the tran&s;action
is thought &s;ufficient for every purpo&s;e, and the youth, who is applauded
for his readine&s;s in this way, fancies him&s;elf a per|fect hi&s;torian. But
the true u&s;e of hi&s;tory does not con&s;i&s;t in being able to &s;ettle a
genealogy, in knowing the events of an ob&s;cure reign, or the true epoch of a
conte&s;ted birth; this knowledge of facts hardly de&s;erves the name of
&s;cience: true wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in tracing effects from their cau&s;es.
To under&s;tand hi&s;tory is to under&s;tand man, who is the &s;ubject. To
&s;tudy hi&s;tory is to weigh the motives, the opinions, the pa&s;&s;ions of
mankind, in order to avoid a &s;imilitude of error in our&s;elves, or profit by
the wi&s;dom of their example.</P>
<P>To &s;tudy hi&s;tory in this manner may be begun at any age.
Children can never be too &s;oon treat|ed as men. Tho&s;e ma&s;ters, who
alledge the inca|pacity of tender youth, only tacitly reproach their own:
the&s;e who are incapable of teaching young minds to rea&s;on, pretend that it
is impo&s;&s;ible. The truth is, they are fonder of making their pupils talk
well than think well, and much the greater <PB N="4" REF="7"> number are better
qualified to give prai&s;e to a ready memory than a &s;ound judgment. The
ge|nerality of mankind con&s;ider a multitude of facts as the real food of the
mind, not as &s;ubjects proper to afford it exerci&s;e. From hence it proceeds,
that hi&s;tory, in&s;tead of teaching us to know our&s;elves, often only
&s;erves to rai&s;e our vanity, by the ap|plau&s;e of the ignorant; or, what is
more dangerous, by the &s;elf-delu&s;ion of untried vanity.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming ignorance is, of all &s;ituations, the mo&s;t
ridiculous: for, in the &s;ame proportion as the real man of wi&s;dom is
preferable to the unlettered ru&s;tic, &s;o much is the ru&s;tic &s;uperior to
him, who without learning imagines him&s;elf learned. Better that &s;uch a man
had never read, for then he might be con&s;cious of his weakne&s;s; but the
half-learn|ed man, relying upon his &s;trength, &s;eldom per|ceives his wants
till he finds his deception pa&s;t a cure.</P>
<P>Your labours in hi&s;tory have hitherto been ra|ther confined to the
words, than the facts, of your hi&s;torical guides. You have read Xenophon or
Livy, rather with a view of learning the dead lan|guages in which they are
written, than of profit|ing by the in&s;tructions which they afford; the time
is now come to di&s;continue the &s;tudy of words for things, for exerci&s;ing
your judgment, and giving more room to rea&s;on than the fancy.</P>
<P>Above all things, I would advi&s;e you to con&s;ult the original
hi&s;torians in every relation. Abridgers, compilers, commentators, and
critics, are in ge|neral only fit to fill the mind with unnece&s;&s;ary
anec|dotes, or lead its re&s;earches a&s;tray. In the im|men&s;ity of various
relations, your care mu&s;t be to &s;elect &s;uch as de&s;erve to be known,
becau&s;e they &s;erve to in&s;truct: the end of your labour &s;hould 
<PB N="5" REF="8"> not be to know in what year fools or &s;avages com|mitted
their extravagances, but by what methods they emerged from barbarity. The
&s;ame nece&s;&s;ity there is for knowing the actions of the worthy part of
princes, al&s;o compels us to endeavour to forget tho&s;e of the ignorant and
vulgar herd of kings, who &s;eemed only to &s;lumber in a &s;eat they were
accidentally called to fill. In &s;hort, not the hi&s;tory of kings, but of
man, &s;hould be your prin|cipal concern, and &s;uch an hi&s;tory is only to be
acquired by con&s;ulting tho&s;e originals who paint|ed the times they lived
in. Their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who pretended to methodize their hi&s;tories, have
almo&s;t univer&s;ally deprived them of all their &s;pirit, and given us rather
a dry catalogue of names, than afforded an opportunity for improving
reflexion.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory, in general, is precious or in&s;ignificant; not from the
brilliancy of the events, the &s;ingu|larity of the adventures, or the
greatne&s;s of the per&s;onages concerned, but from the &s;kill, penetra|tion,
and judgment of the ob&s;erver. Tacitus fre|quently complains of his want of
materials, of the littlene&s;s of his incidents, of the weakne&s;s and villainy
of his actors; yet, even from &s;uch indif|ferent &s;ubjects, he has wrought
out the mo&s;t pleaf|ing and the mo&s;t in&s;tructive hi&s;tory that ever was
written; it will therefore be entirely the work of your own judgment to convert
the generality of hi&s;torians to your benefit; they are, at pre&s;ent, but
rude materials, and require a fine di&s;cernment to &s;eparate the u&s;eful
from the unnece&s;&s;ary, and analy&s;e their different principles.</P>
<P>Yet, mi&s;take me not, I would not have hi&s;tory to con&s;i&s;t of
dry &s;peculations upon facts, told with phlegm, and pur&s;ued without
intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion; nor would I have your rea&s;on fatigued continually
<PB N="6" REF="9"> in critical re&s;earch; all I require is, that the
hi&s;|torian would give as much exerci&s;e to the judge|ment as the
imagination: it is as much his duty to act the philo&s;opher, or politician, in
his narra|tives, as to collect materials for narration. With|out a
philo&s;ophical &s;kill in di&s;cerning, his very nar|rative mu&s;t be
frequently fal&s;e, fabulous, and con|tradictory: without political &s;agacity,
his charac|ters mu&s;t be ill drawn, and vice and virtue be di&s;|tributed
without di&s;cernment or candour.</P>
<P>What hi&s;torian can render virtue &s;o amiable as Xenophon? Who can
intere&s;t the reader &s;o much as Livy? Salu&s;t is an in&s;tance of the
mo&s;t delicate exactne&s;s, and Tacitus of the mo&s;t &s;olid reflexion: from
a perfect acquaintance with the&s;e, the youth|ful &s;tudent can acquire more
knowlege of man|kind, a more perfect acquaintance with antiquity, and a more
ju&s;t manner of thinking and expre&s;&s;ion, than, perhaps; from any others of
any age or country. Other ancient hi&s;torians may be read to advance your
&s;tudy in ancient learning, but the&s;e &s;hould be the ground-work of all
your re&s;earches. Without a previous acquaintance with the&s;e, you enter upon
other writers improperly prepared; un|til the&s;e have placed you in a proper
train of mo|ralizing the incidents, other hi&s;torians may, per|haps, injure,
but will not improve you. Let me therefore, at pre&s;ent, my dear Charles,
intreat you to be&s;tow the proper care upon tho&s;e trea&s;ures of antiquity,
and by your letters, every po&s;t, com|municate to your father, your friend,
the re&s;ult of your reflexions upon them. I am at a lo&s;s, whe|ther I &s;hall
find more &s;atisfaction in hearing your remarks, or communicating my own?
However, in which &s;oever of them I &s;hall be employed, it will make my
highe&s;t amu&s;ement; amu&s;ement is <PB N="7" REF="10"> all that I can now
expect in this life, for ambition has long for&s;aken me; and, perhaps, my
child, after all, that what your noble ance&s;tor ob&s;erved is mo&s;t true: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>When all is done, human life is, at the
great|e&s;t and the be&s;t, but like a froward child, that mu&s;t be played
with and humoured a little to keep it quiet till it falls a&s;leep, and then
the care is over. I am, my dear boy, your mo&s;t tender friend and affectionate
father,</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IENTIRELY acquie&s;ce in your &s;entiments, that univer&s;al
hi&s;tory is a &s;ubject too exten&s;ive for human comprehen&s;ion, and that he
who would really reap its advantages mu&s;t be contented to bound his views.
Satisfied with being &s;uperficial|ly acquainted with the tran&s;actions of
many coun|tries, he &s;hould place his attention only on a few. Your remarks on
the Greek and Roman republics far &s;urpa&s;s my expectations; you have
ju&s;tly cha|racterized them as the fine&s;t in&s;tances of political
&s;ociety, that could be founded on the ba&s;is of a fal&s;e religion. Where
religion is imperfect, poli|tical &s;ociety, and all laws enacted for its
improve|ment, mu&s;t be imperfect al&s;o; religion is but phi|lo&s;ophy
refined, and no man could ever boa&s;t an excellence in politics, who&s;e mind
had not been previou&s;ly opened and enlarged by the in&s;titutions of
theology, an error in religion ever producing defects in legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>Forgive me, dear Charles, if I once more con|gratulate my&s;elf upon
the plea&s;ure I expect from <PB N="8" REF="11"> your future eminence; you are
now tinctured with univer&s;al hi&s;tory, and are thoroughly conver&s;ant with
that of Greece and Rome; but there is another department of hi&s;tory &s;till
remaining, and that much more important than any I have yet men|tioned, I mean
the HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The hi&s;tory of this country is the proper &s;tudy of
an Engli&s;hman: however, it peculiarly concerns tho&s;e who may, like you,
probably one day have &s;uch an important character to &s;upport in its
admini&s;tra|tion; and who&s;e name, perhaps, may find a place in the
hi&s;toric page. All who are inamoured of the liberty and the happine&s;s which
they, peculiar|ly enjoy, in this happy region, mu&s;t &s;urely be de|&s;irous
of knowing the methods by which &s;uch ad|vantages were acquired; the
progre&s;&s;ive &s;teps from barbarity to &s;ocial refinement, from &s;ociety
to the highe&s;t pitch of well con&s;tituted freedom. All Europe &s;tands in
a&s;toni&s;nment at the wi&s;dom of our con&s;titution, and it would argue the
highe&s;t degree of in&s;en&s;ibility in a native of this country, and one too
who from his birth enjoys peculiar privileges, to be ignorant of what others
&s;o much admire.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon a principal u&s;e, to which &s;ome
apply the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, I mean that of making it the topic of common
conver&s;ation; yet, even from &s;uch a motive, though in it&s;elf trifling, no
well-bred man can plead ignorance: its great|e&s;t advantage, however, is, that
a knowledge of the pa&s;t enables the attentive mind to under&s;tand the
pre&s;ent: our laws, cu&s;toms, liberties; abu&s;e of liberty can &s;carcely be
under&s;tood without tra|cing them to their &s;ource, and hi&s;tory is the only
channel by which we can arrive at what we &s;o eagerly pur&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"> But were I to compare the hi&s;tory of our own
country, in point of amu&s;ement, with that of others, I know of none, either
ancient or mo|dern, that can vie with it in this re&s;pect; in other
hi&s;tories, remote and exten&s;ive connexions interrupt the reader's
intere&s;t, and de&s;troy the &s;implicity of the plan: the hi&s;tory of Greece
may be ea&s;ily di|vided into &s;even different hi&s;tories, and into &s;o
ma|ny it has actually been: the hi&s;tory of Rome, from the time it begins to
be authentic, is little el&s;e than an account of the then known world; but, in
England, &s;eparated, by its &s;ituation, from the continent, the reader may
con&s;ider the whole nar|rative, with all its viciffitudes, in one point of
view; it unites the philo&s;opher's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Hutche&s;on.</NOTE> definition of beauty, by being <HI>variou&s;ly
uniform.</HI></P>
<P>The materials for an hi&s;tory of our own coun|try are therefore
excellent, but I can direct to few who have improved them with a proper degree
of a&s;&s;iduity or &s;kill. The hi&s;torians, who have treated of this
&s;ubject, have in general written for a party, many with an open avowal of
virulence and abu&s;e. Some, who have had talents for this undertaking, were
unable to afford them&s;elves &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to poli&s;h their work
into the degree of requi&s;ite perfection; while others, who have laboured with
&s;ufficient a&s;&s;iduity, have been woefully deficient in point of
&s;agacity, or proper &s;kill in the choice of tho&s;e facts they thought
proper to relate. What|ever has been known, and not what was worth knowing, has
been faithfully tran&s;cribed, &s;o that the pre&s;ent accounts of the country
re&s;emble the ancient face of the &s;oil; here an uncultivated fo|re&s;t,
there a de&s;olate wild, and, in a very few <PB N="10" REF="13"> places, a
&s;pot of earth adorned by art, and &s;miling with all the luxuriance of
nature. To make hi|&s;tory like the &s;oil truly u&s;eful, the ob&s;tacles to
im|provement mu&s;t be torn away, new a&s;&s;i&s;tances mu&s;t be acquired from
art, nor can the work be deemed properly fini&s;hed, till the whole puts on
&s;implicity, uniformity, and elegance: as the ca&s;e is at pre|&s;ent, we
mu&s;t read a library, to acquire a know|ledge of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory; and,
after all, be con|tent to forget more than we remember.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of England may be divided, proper|ly enough, into
three periods; with regard to their duration, indeed, very different, but
almo&s;t of equal importance. The fir&s;t is from the commencement of our
knowledge of the country to its conque&s;t by the Norman; the &s;econd, from
the time of William the Conqueror to the alteration of the con&s;titution, by
the beheading King Charles I; the la&s;t contains the remaining period of
Engli&s;h hi&s;|tory. It will at once appear, that &s;uch a divi|&s;ion is
extremely unequal: the fir&s;t department may be &s;aid to extend to a period
of more than a thou&s;and years; the &s;econd contains not le&s;s than &s;even
hundred, while the remaining does not take up two. Chronologi&s;ts, indeed,
would divide it in a very different manner; however, I am rather inclined to
this divi&s;ion, more by the peculiar u&s;e which may be made of each period,
than the mere regularity of time. To con&s;ider the fir&s;t part, with
accuracy, belongs properly to the philo&s;opher; the &s;econd is the
bu&s;ine&s;s of him who would un|der&s;tand our con&s;titution, and is the
proper &s;tudy of a legi&s;lator; and the la&s;t of &s;uch as would be
acquainted with the connexions and relations in which we &s;tand with regard to
our neighbours of <PB N="11" REF="14"> the continent, and our foreign and
dome&s;tic trade, namely to the merchant and politician.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any other pa&s;&s;ion, but that of curio&s;ity,
excited by a knowledge of the early part of our hi&s;tory. We may go through
the account of that di&s;tant aera, with the &s;ame impartiality with which we
con&s;ider the original inhabitants of any other country, as the cu&s;toms of
our Bri|ti&s;h ance&s;tors have no connexion with our own. But then, to &s;ome
minds, it mu&s;t be a plea&s;ing di&s;qui&s;ition to ob&s;erve the human
animal, by de|grees, dive&s;ting him&s;elf of his native ferocity, and
acquiring the arts of happine&s;s and peace; to trace the &s;teps, by which he
leaves his precarious meal, acquired by the chace, for a more certain, but a
more laborious, repa&s;t, acquired by cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>After the conque&s;t, the rude outlines of our pre&s;ent
con&s;titution began to be formed. Before the Norman inva&s;ion, there might be
&s;ome cu&s;|toms re&s;embling tho&s;e at pre&s;ent in practice; but the only
rea&s;on of their continuance was, becau&s;e they had before been practi&s;ed
in common among the invaders. At this period, therefore, an Eng|li&s;hman
becomes intere&s;ted in the narrative; he perceives the ri&s;e and the
rea&s;ons for &s;everal laws, which now &s;erve to re&s;train his own conduct,
or pre&s;erve his property. The rights of our monarchs, the claims of foreign
potentates, the ineffectual &s;truggles for liberty, and the gradual
incroach|ments of ambition, &s;hould highly intere&s;t him, as he in &s;ome
mea&s;ure owes to the&s;e tran&s;actions the happine&s;s he enjoys.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t period is what is chiefly incumbent upon almo&s;t
every man to be particularly conver|&s;ant <PB N="12" REF="15"> in. Every
per&s;on, re&s;iding here, has a &s;hare in the liberties of this kingdom; and
the genera|lity of the people are ultimately inve&s;ted with the legi&s;lation.
It is therefore each man's duty to know that con&s;titution, which, by his
birth-right, he is called to govern; a freeholder, in a free kingdom, &s;hould
certainly be in&s;tructed in the original of that agreement, by which he holds
&s;o precious a tenure.</P>
<P>The&s;e are motives that equally influence almo&s;t every rank of
people, but how much more forci|bly &s;hould they operate upon you, who&s;e
honours, who&s;e tru&s;ts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, are likely to be &s;o
con&s;iderable. Others may have their liberties to &s;upport; you mu&s;t
&s;u&s;tain your liberty, your pro|perty, and the dignity of your &s;tation. I
&s;hall therefore, without farther preface, in &s;ome future corre&s;pondence,
communicate the re&s;ult of my en|quiries on this &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which,
I own, has employed all the lei&s;ure I had to &s;pare from, I will not &s;ay

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be a natural tendency, in every nation, to run its
antiquity as far back as po&s;&s;ible, and when once they have arrived at the
regions of fiction, no bounds are &s;et to the wonders of every narration. Were
we to take our character of the ancient inhabitants of this i&s;land, from the
legends, monuments, or traditions, which have been left by tho&s;e inhabitants
them&s;elves, we might be apt to imagine that arts, even in that early pe|riod,
were cultivated, and &s;ciences known to &s;ome degree of perfection. The
Druids, if we believe &s;ome fragments of their own, under&s;tood a&s;trono|my
and medicine, and gave le&s;&s;ions in morality and metaphy&s;ics. But what
credit can be given to the accounts of a barbarous people, told by
them&s;elves? The knowledge and learning, indeed, of their prie&s;ts, might be
great, if compared with the almo&s;t brutal &s;implicity and ignorance of the
re&s;t of the people; but it could not de&s;erve the name of &s;cience, if put
in competition with what was known and practi&s;ed by their polite
cotempo|raries of Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>From the accounts of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible writers, and not from the
fictitious ab&s;urdities of the Druids them&s;elves, we are to e&s;timate this
ancient people of Britain. All that we find related by credible witne&s;&s;es
and &s;ufficient authority, before the Ro|mans <PB N="14" REF="17"> entered
this i&s;land, is, that the country was filled with incredible numbers of
people, and their fields &s;tored with great plenty of animals, &s;avage and
dome&s;tic. Their hou&s;es were meanly built, and &s;cattered, as if
accidentally, over the country, without ob&s;ervance, di&s;tance, or order. The
only motives of their choice were the peculiar fertility of &s;ome happy
&s;pot, or the convenience of wood and water. They lived upon milk, and fle&s;h
pro|cured by the chace, for corn was &s;carcely known among them. What cloaths
they wore were &s;kins of bea&s;ts, but a great part of their bodies was left
always expo&s;ed to the injuries of the weather; all that was naked being
painted with blue. This cu&s;tom of painting was univer&s;al among them, either
in order to &s;trike terror into their enemies, or to defend the pores of the
naked &s;kin from the vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Their towns, if a collection of huts could de|&s;erve that name,
were mo&s;tly built upon the coa&s;ts, in &s;uch places as &s;trangers
generally re&s;orted to for the &s;ake of commerce. The commodities, ex|ported,
were chiefly hides and tin, and, probably, other &s;pontaneous productions of
the &s;oil, which required no art in the preparation.</P>
<P>Their government, like that of the ancient Gauls, con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;everal petty principalities, which &s;eem to be the original governments of
mankind, and deduced from the natural right of paternal do|minion: but whether
the&s;e little principalities de|&s;cended by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or were elected
by the con|&s;ent of the people, is not recorded. Upon great or uncommon
dangers, indeed, the chief com|mander of all their forces was cho&s;en by
common con&s;ent, in a general a&s;&s;embly, as Cae&s;ar relates of
Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus, upon his inva&s;ion. The &s;ame was <PB N="15" REF="18">
done upon their revolts again&s;t the Roman colo|nies, under Caractacus and
their Queen Boadicea; for, among them, women were admitted to their
principalities, and general commands, by the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, merit,
or nobility.</P>
<P>Such were the cu&s;toms of the ancient Britons, and the &s;ame may
&s;erve for a de&s;cription of every other barbarous nation, of which we have
any knowledge. Savage man, is an animal in almo&s;t every country the &s;ame;
and all the difference between nations re&s;ults from cu&s;toms introduced by
luxury, or cultivated by refinement. What the inhabitant of Britain was at that
time, the inha|bitant of South America, or Cafraria, may be at this day. But
there was one cu&s;tom, among the ancient inhabitants of this i&s;land, which
&s;eems pe|culiar to them&s;elves, and is not to be found in the accounts of
any other ancient or modern nation. The cu&s;tom I mean, was a community of
wives, among certain numbers, and by common con&s;ent. Every man married indeed
but one woman, who was always after, and alone, e&s;teemed his wife: but, it
was u&s;ual for five or &s;ix, ten, twelve, or more, either brothers or
friends, as they could agree, to have all their wives in common. But this,
though calculated for their mutual happine&s;s, in fact proved their greate&s;t
di&s;turbance; and we have &s;ome in&s;tances, in which this community of wives
produced di&s;&s;en&s;ions, jealou&s;ies, and death. Every woman's children,
however, were the pro|perty of him who had married her; but all claim|ed a
&s;hare in the care and defence of the whole &s;o|ciety, &s;ince no man knew
which were his own.</P>
<P>To e&s;timate the wi&s;dom of the people, we mu&s;t examine the
manners of their teachers. If the laity were &s;o very barbarous, the Druids,
their <PB N="16" REF="19"> in&s;tructors, mu&s;t have but few pretences to
&s;upe|rior refinement. Yet, I know not how, we have different and almo&s;t
contradictory accounts of this extraordinary fraternity. They have been
repre|&s;ented, by &s;ome, as per&s;ons of learning, which had been derived to
them by long tradition. Their &s;kill con&s;i&s;ted in the ob&s;ervation of the
heavens, and, upon the influence of its appearance, they gave their countrymen
omens of failure or &s;ucce&s;s. They taught a morality, which principally
con|&s;i&s;ted in ju&s;tice and fortitude. Their lives were &s;imple and
innocent, in woods, caverns, and hol|low trees; their food acorns or berries,
and their drink water. They were re&s;pected and admired, not only for knowing
more than other men, but for de&s;pi&s;ing what all others valued and
pur&s;ued; by their virtue and temperance, they reproved and corrected tho&s;e
vices in others, from which they were them&s;elves happily free; and made u&s;e
of no other arms, than the reverence due to integrity, to enforce obedience to
their own commands. From &s;uch a conduct as this, they derived &s;o much
authority, that they were not only prie&s;ts, but judges al&s;o, throughout the
nation. No laws were in&s;tituted without their approbation; no per|&s;on
puni&s;hed with bonds, or death, but by their condemnation.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, we learn, that all their knowledge was
impo&s;ture, and their &s;implicity on|ly a &s;avage pa&s;&s;ion for
&s;olitude. Their language was barbarous, and their manners &s;till more rude.
The&s;e were &s;uch as called aloud for &s;ome more enlightened in&s;tructors,
to conquer and to direct them. The Druids, &s;eemingly formed for the people
among whom they governed, &s;acrificed human victims, which they burned in
large wicker <PB N="17" REF="20"> idols, which were made &s;o capacious, as to
con|tain a multitude of per&s;ons, who were, in this manner, at once con&s;umed
in the flames. The female Druids plunged their knives in the brea&s;ts of the
pri&s;oners taken in war, and prophe&s;ied from the manner in which the blood
happened to &s;tream from the wound. Several of their altars, con&s;i&s;t|ed of
four broad &s;tones, three of which were &s;et edgewi&s;e, and the fourth
horizontally on the top, and are &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>In accounts, &s;o &s;eemingly contradictory, we are entirely to give
a&s;&s;ent to neither. That they pretended to a&s;trology is certain; this, and
not their piety, probably gave them &s;uch influence a|mong their countrymen.
To judge of what the Britons then were, as I have already hinted, we mu&s;t
look at what &s;avage nations are at pre&s;ent: We perceive, what authority a
pretence to a&s;trolo|gy, in barbarous countries, confers; the a&s;trologer
being generally con&s;idered, in almo&s;t all the Ea&s;tern kingdoms, as the
&s;econd, if not the fir&s;t man of the &s;tate. That the Druids deceived the
people with a fal&s;e religion cannot be denied, but, yet, I can never think
that they were impo&s;tors: they fir&s;t deceived them&s;elves into a belief
and veneration of what they taught, and then made u&s;e of every motive to
per&s;uade the people. The ignorant and erroneous, in the commerce of this
life, are many; the villains and impo&s;tors are found more rarely. As for
human &s;acrifices, few probably were de|&s;troyed upon this horrid occa&s;ion,
but pri&s;oners taken in war, and &s;uch have ever been &s;acrificed, by
&s;avage nations, rather from a principle of re|venge, than religion. It is not
peculiar to the religion of the Druids alone, but was primarily the 
<PB N="18" REF="21"> barbarous practice of tho&s;e very nations who then
exclaimed again&s;t it mo&s;t loudly.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear Charles, the religion of the Druids was no more
than that of every barbarous nation, with who&s;e ceremonies we have any
ac|quaintance. This was the religion, not only practi&s;ed in Britain, but
which prevailed, origi|nally, over the greate&s;t part of the world. The
original inhabitants of Europe, as a learned an|tiquary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mountfaucon.</NOTE> has finely proved, were the &s;ame: all
&s;peaking one language, obeying the &s;ame deities, and governed by &s;imilar
laws. Succe&s;&s;ive inva|&s;ions, from different parts of A&s;ra, brought new
changes; and, as the colonies went we&s;tward, the Greek, the Roman, and
Teutonic languages and cu&s;toms were &s;uper-induced over the ancient Celtic.
All tho&s;e countries, mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible to &s;trangers, or mo&s;t
&s;ubject to inva&s;ions, were fir&s;t changed; tho&s;e which lay &s;urrounded
by mountains, or were in &s;ome mea&s;ure retired by their &s;ituation, &s;uch
as Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, Ireland, Bi&s;cay, Crim Tartary, &amp;c.
all pre&s;erved their primitive manners. It is even found, that the&s;e
countries &s;till adhere to many of the ancient Druidical cu&s;|toms, as far as
the alteration of religion will ad|mit. We have, as yet, an opportunity of
view|ing many of their ancient, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, venerable
&s;uper&s;titions, &s;till in Ireland: the&s;e are, however, wearing out by
degrees, and another century will entirely efface every ve&s;tige of barba|rous
antiquity. I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IT is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, happy for a barbarous people to be
conquered by a country more po|lite than them&s;elves. Whatever evils the
ambition of heroes generally produces, it is attended with one advantage, that
of di&s;&s;eminating arts, and making humanity more exten&s;ive. The Britons,
&s;avage and rude as they were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, called for more polite
in&s;tructors, and the Romans, of all the conquerors hi&s;tory can produce,
were at once the mo&s;t polite, the mo&s;t generous, and humane.</P>
<P>A country, divided like Britain into a variety of &s;mall
principalities, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been &s;e|parated into various, and
often oppo&s;ite, intere&s;ts. Its princes mu&s;t have been frequently at war,
merely for the &s;ake of plunder, to keep their troops in exerci&s;e, or to
gratify vanity and ambition. We may ea&s;ily, therefore, form an idea of the
mi&s;eries of a rude people, who had nothing but fear to keep them from war
with each other, and who could build no longer on a la&s;ting peace, than while
they avoided giving an opportunity of plun|der to their enemies.</P>
<P>To complete the picture of the calamities of this people, all the
trading and maritime towns, next the continent, were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
foreign invaders long before the Romans entered the i&s;land. The&s;e were a
people who had been received from motives of ho&s;pitality, and who, under the
character of exiles in di&s;tre&s;s, having got footing and &s;helter among&s;t
the natives, afterwards made war upon them, as enemies. This, added to their
frequent tumults and ma&s;&s;acres among each other, <PB N="20" REF="23">
rendered them, not only internally unhappy, but an ea&s;y prey to every
invader. Be&s;ides, they were ill &s;upplied with arms, and tho&s;e they had
were only &s;uch as were no longer in u&s;e among the refined na|tions of the
continent. They fought in chariots armed with &s;cythes, applied to the wheels.
The&s;e were terrible without execution, and made rather to a&s;toni&s;h the
rude and ignorant, than to break &s;uch ranks, as were not to be daunted by the
mere ap|pearance of danger. Their defen&s;ive armour only con&s;i&s;ted of a
wicker &s;hield; and they approached an enemy &s;houting, cla&s;hing their
arms, and &s;ound|ing their trumpets, as if they had a de&s;ign rather to
terrify than de&s;troy. Their chariots generally attacked the enemy's cavalry,
and from the&s;e they would frequently leap, and fight on foot, till, being
fatigued or overpowered, they would re&s;ume their &s;eats and make the be&s;t
retreat po&s;&s;ible. Unpo|li&s;hed nations, though they have more fiercene&s;s
in the on&s;et, never act with that cool pre&s;evering re&s;olution, which
almo&s;t ever en&s;ures victory. This can be acquired, only where di&s;cipline
and &s;ubordination have long prevailed; and a nation, however brave, levied in
ha&s;te, will probably ne|ver make a figure again&s;t veteran troops, harden|ed
by contention, or elated by long &s;ucce&s;s. This was the nature of the
inhabitants, but the face of the country rendered them &s;till more open to
every invader. It was plain and open, without towns, fortre&s;&s;es, or any
place of retreat to &s;ecure them from an enemy, except what their fore&s;ts
might happen to afford; in a word, they were de&s;titute of all means of
defence, but what their native courage was able to &s;upply, or a love of
liberty might in&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24"> Such were the people and cu&s;toms of Britain,
when the Romans fir&s;t invaded their i&s;land, under the en&s;igns of Julius
Cae&s;ar, the greate&s;t com|mander that ever led an army. When I con&s;ider
this great man, who had already been the con|queror of Gaul; when I reflect on
his courage, his conduct, and per&s;everance; when I take into my view the
troops he headed, inured to di&s;cipline, and fighting in a manner with which
barbarous nations were entirely unacquainted; when I con|&s;ider the&s;e
circum&s;tances, and compare them with tho&s;e of the Britons in the &s;ame
period, I feel a more than u&s;ual &s;hare of &s;urprize at the bravery and
conduct with which the&s;e poor barbarians op|po&s;ed him.</P>
<P>It was an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, in the politics of Rome, to deem
all auxiliaries as principals, and to allow none to a&s;&s;i&s;t the enemies of
the &s;tate with impunity. This was the pretence Cae&s;ar laid hold of to
ju&s;tify his inva&s;ion of England, which was not only looked upon as an ally,
but likewi&s;e as an a&s;ylum to the Gauli&s;h nations, which were at that time
enemies of Rome. This might, pro|bably, be the ground of his inva&s;ion, but
the plea&s;ure of conque&s;t was his real motive. To ex|tend the Roman empire,
though already it was become too exten&s;ive to be governed, was at that time
thought the mo&s;t glorious atchievment of humanity. The re&s;t of Europe was,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ubdued, and nothing left but countries de&s;olate by
fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes, and neither tempting, from their appearance, nor
affording any hopes of plunder, from their poverty. He|roi&s;m was, at that
time, the boa&s;t of ambition, nor have men, till very lately, been taught to
con|&s;ider conquerors with an eye of contempt or dete&s;|taticn. 
<PB N="22" REF="25"> Cae&s;ar was re&s;olved on being a hero, and was more fond
of triumph than ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>His forces were compo&s;ed of Germans, Bata|vians, and Gauls, and
the flower of his veteran Roman legions. He &s;et &s;ail from Gaul about
midnight, and arrived on the Briti&s;h coa&s;t about
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">en in the afternoon, fifty-five
years before the Chri&s;tian aera. The Britons, with their naked troops, made a
brave oppo&s;ition again&s;t this veteran army: the encounters between them
were fierce, and many, the lo&s;&s;es were mutual, and the &s;ucce&s;s various.
Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus was cho&s;en general in chief of the Briti&s;h forces, but
even a foreign in|vader was not &s;ufficient to keep the petty princes, which
compo&s;ed the barbarous army, united. Di&s;&s;en&s;ion &s;oon entered
among&s;t them, and &s;ome, jealous of the &s;incerity of their general, or
envy|ing his greatne&s;s, fled over to Cae&s;ar, &s;ubmitted to the Romans, and
claimed their protection. Others followed this ba&s;e example, till
Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus, weakened by &s;o many de&s;ertions, re&s;olved upon making
what terms he was able, while he had yet an opportunity. He &s;ends to
Cae&s;ar, acknowledges the Romanpower, agrees upon a certain tribute, and
delivers ho&s;tages. Britain, from the beginning, has been remarkable for
internal di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and di&s;&s;en&s;ion ever &s;trengthens or invites
the invader.</P>
<P>The Romans were plea&s;ed with the name of a new conque&s;t, and
glad of ending an adventure with honour, which at fir&s;t promi&s;ed only
difficul|ties and danger. But the extended fore&s;t, and the trackle&s;s wild,
was not a quarry for men intent on &s;poil, and rai&s;ed to greater
expectations. Having, therefore, rather di&s;covered than &s;ubdued the
&s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, they returned into Gaul with their whole
forces, and once more left <PB N="23" REF="26"> the Britons to their cu&s;toms,
religion, and laws. By two expeditions which Cae&s;ar made into this i&s;land,
he rather increa&s;ed the glory than the do|minions of Rome, and gave Britain
the honour of being the la&s;t triumph of that mighty republic, which had
before reduced the mo&s;t powerful king|doms of the habitable globe.</P>
<P>Whatever the tribute was, which they had contracted annually to pay,
we have many rea&s;ons, from hi&s;tory, to believe, they paid it but very
neg|ligently. I mention this, as an in&s;tance of the little faith which can be
expected from an extort|ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, while there is no longer a power
to enforce obedience. During the reign of Augu&s;tus, that Emperor had formed a
de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Bri|tain, but was diverted from it by an unexpected
revolt of the Pannonians. Some years after, he again re&s;umed his de&s;ign,
but, being met in his way by the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, promi&s;ing the
ac|cu&s;tomed tribute, and making the u&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions, he a &s;econd
time de&s;i&s;ted. The year fol|lowing, finding them unfaithful to their
promi&s;e, he prepared, a third time, for the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land, but
was prevented from putting his de&s;ign into execution, by their
amba&s;&s;adors, who averted his fury by their adulations and humility. The
mo&s;t &s;avage countries under&s;tand flattery almo&s;t as well as the mo&s;t
polite, &s;ince, to be &s;ufficiently &s;ervile is, perhaps, the whole of the
art, and the true&s;t method of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Tiberius followed the maxims of Augu&s;tus, and, wi&s;ely judging
the Roman empire already too exten&s;ive, made no attempt upon this i&s;land.
Some Roman &s;oldiers being wrecked on the Eng|li&s;h coa&s;t, the inhabitants
not only a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with the greate&s;t humanity, but &s;ent them, in 
<PB N="24" REF="27"> &s;afety, back to their general. In con&s;equence of
&s;uch friendly di&s;po&s;itions, there was a con&s;tant in|tercour&s;e between
the two nations; the principal Engli&s;h nobility re&s;orted to Rome, and
&s;ome re|ceived their education there.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the Britons began &s;en&s;ibly to improve. The
fir&s;t art, which a &s;avage people is generally taught by their politer
neighbours, is that of war. Tho' not wholly addicted to the Roman manner of
fighting, the Britons, however, adopted &s;everal of their improvements, both
in their arms, and their arrangement in the field. Their feroci|ty to
&s;trangers was now al&s;o le&s;&s;ened, and they fir&s;t began to coin money,
the olde&s;t Briti&s;h coin being that of Comius, who learned a part of the
Roman politene&s;s by a re&s;idence in Cae&s;ar's camp. They &s;till, however,
continued to live as herd&s;men and hunters, and adhered to their u&s;ual
&s;uper&s;titions, a manife&s;t in&s;tance of the country being, as yet, but
thinly inhabited. When we read, in Cae&s;ar, of the numbers of this people, and
the va&s;t armies they brought into the field, I am apt to doubt his veracity.
Such armies could &s;carcely be levied, even now; and yet, nothing is more
certain, than that Britain is at lea&s;t ten times more populous now than it
was at that time. A nation of herd&s;men and hunters can never be very
populous; their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence takes up a large tract of country, while the
hu&s;bandman converts every part of nature to human u&s;e, and produces the
greate&s;t quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from circum&s;cribed
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Roman hi&s;torian has increa&s;ed their numbers, only
to increa&s;e the lu&s;tre of his glory in &s;ubduing them. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;econd expedition into Britain was made by Claudius, under the
conduct of Plautius, and pur&s;ued by O&s;torius, and other Roman com|manders,
with the u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. It is true, there were many Britons who preferred
their hardy &s;im|plicity to imported elegance, and, rather than offer their
necks to the Roman yoke, pre&s;ented their brea&s;ts to the &s;word. But, by
degrees, their fierce|ne&s;s was &s;ubdued, or wholly de&s;troyed; the
&s;outhern coa&s;t, with all the adjacent inland country, was &s;ecured by the
conquerors, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by fortifying camps, building
fortre&s;&s;es, and planting colonies. The re&s;t of the country &s;eemed to
look on, patiently waiting till it became their turn to be expelled from their
precarious habitations, or to receive their imperious ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perity, in general, breeds in&s;olence; the corruption of the
Praetors and officers, that were appointed to govern this harra&s;&s;ed people,
once more rou&s;ed them into re&s;entment. Caractacus, General and King of the
northern Britons, with inferior numbers, not only made a brave defence, but
often &s;eemed to claim a doubtful victory. A drawn battle might be
con&s;idered as a triumph, to a people only u&s;ed to a defeat. He continued
nine years to hold out, and threatened fatal dangers to the Roman colonies. At
length, however, in a deci&s;ive battle, the Britons were totally defeated, and
Caractacus taken pri&s;oner. His exclamation, when led in triumph through Rome,
is too remark|able to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. Ob&s;erving the
opulence, &s;plendor, and luxury of that great city, <PB N="26" REF="29">

<P>Yet, one expiring effort more was made by the Britons, to recover
their liberty in the times of Nero. Paulinus, the general of the Romans, going
with the greate&s;t part of his forces, to &s;ubdue the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey,
where the &s;uper&s;ti|tions of the Druids were &s;till practi&s;ed with all
their horrid circum&s;tances; the Britons, pre&s;um|ing upon his ab&s;ence,
made a general in&s;urrection under Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, whom the
Romans had treated with &s;hocking indignities, con|demning her, for &s;ome
&s;light offence, to be whipped, and her daughters to be ravi&s;hed by the
&s;oldiery: in revenge, therefore, at the head of a numerous army, &s;he fell
upon the Romans wherever they were defencele&s;s, took their ca&s;tles,
de&s;troyed the chief &s;eats of their power at London and Veru|lam, and,
&s;uch was the &s;laughter, that &s;eventy thou&s;and fell by this revolt.
Paulinus, however, &s;oon returned with his army, encountered the Briti&s;h
forces headed by their Queen, overthrew their powers, and pur&s;ued his victory
with a &s;laughter of eighty thou&s;and men, while the con|quered Queen
poi&s;oned her&s;elf in de&s;pair. Here ended the liberties of Britain. All
that now re|mained were &s;atisfied to exchange freedom for life: this was
their la&s;t &s;truggle; they now lo&s;t, not only the hopes, but even the
de&s;ire of vindicating the privileges of nature</P>
<P>From this time the Romans &s;eemed more de&s;i|rous of &s;ecuring
what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, than of making new conque&s;ts; they &s;eparated
the Roman province, by a wall, from the Picts, their barbarous and re&s;tle&s;s
neighbours; and attempted to humanize the <PB N="27" REF="30"> fiercene&s;s of
tho&s;e who acknowledged their power. The Roman laws and cu&s;toms, habits and
arms, language and manners, baths and fea&s;ts, &s;tudies and learning, were
introduced and became gene|ral. A conduct &s;o prudent, which had been fir&s;t
begun by Agricola, was pur&s;ued by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors with &s;o much
&s;ucce&s;s, that the Romans had little trouble afterwards in Britain, except
in the defence of their northern frontier.</P>
<P>Had Rome continued peaceable mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, the Britons,
now almo&s;t perfectly civilized, might have found means of being happy. But,
upon the divi&s;ions in the Roman empire, which was ruled by faction, and
governed by an in&s;o|lent &s;oldiery, torn by &s;edition at home, and
&s;ub|ject to inva&s;ion abroad, the Briti&s;h legions were, at &s;everal
times, called over into Gaul, and, with them, great numbers of the brave&s;t of
the Briti&s;h youth. Thus, we &s;ee every method pur&s;ued, to weaken and
render this once hardy people effe|minate. The arts of luxury were introduced
to &s;often their minds; they were denied the u&s;e of arms, which might
&s;till uphold their native brave|ry; the flower of their youth were, at
intervals, drained away, and tho&s;e that remained were bred up in &s;ervitude
and &s;ubjection. All tho&s;e who had a pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, were long
&s;ince de&s;troy|ed, and none were &s;uffered to live, but &s;uch as had
betrayed their country in the beginning, or had been too cowardly to re&s;i&s;t
any unju&s;t in|va&s;ion. It is no wonder, therefore, that, as the Roman forces
decrea&s;ed in Britain, the Picts be|came more bold in their incur&s;ions.
The&s;e, pro|bably were the de&s;cendants of &s;uch Britons as once bravely
exchanged their country for freedom, and cro&s;&s;ing the narrow &s;ea, which
the Romans <PB N="28" REF="31"> could not guard, in little boats of wicker
covered with leather, they filled the country, wherever they came, with
&s;poil, &s;laughter, and de&s;olation: when repul&s;ed, by &s;uperior numbers,
they u&s;ually retired, loaded with &s;poils, and watched for the next
opportunity of inva&s;ion, when the Romans were drawn away into the remoter
parts of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The&s;e enterprizes were often repeated, and as often repre&s;&s;ed,
till, in the reign of Valentinian the younger, the empire of Rome began to
trem|ble for its capital. Myriads of barbarous nations, under the names of
Goths and Vandals, invaded the dominion of this mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, with
terror, per&s;everance, and rapidity. All the Ro|man legions were now,
therefore, drawn from Britain, and all the Britons, who were fit for mi|litary
&s;ervice, were brought away to relieve the Emperor, who was pur&s;ued by the
Goths into Piedmont, and there be&s;ieged in Aquilea, a town he attempted to
defend.</P>
<P>The Romans, now taking their la&s;t leave of this province, left the
Britons to their own go|vernment, and the choice of their own Kings. For the
exerci&s;e of their arms, and for repairing their ramparts, they gave them the
be&s;t in&s;truc|tions that &s;uch terrible times would permit. No|thing can be
more affecting than the picture of Britain at that period; though the Roman
&s;ol|diery were drawn away, their families and de|&s;cendants were &s;till
&s;pread over the whole coun|try, and left without a &s;ingle per&s;on, of
conduct or courage, to defend them. The Britons, who were left, began to enter
into fre&s;h di&s;&s;entions for &s;uperiority: the enemy continued to pour in
greater numbers than ever, from their native fore&s;ts and <PB N="29" REF="32">
mountains: famine, with all its horrid attendants, of di&s;ea&s;e, robbery, and
&s;edition, increa&s;ed the mi&s;ery of the times: their vices, as Gildas, a
co|temporary writer, ob&s;erves, kept pace with their calamities, the whole
forming one dete&s;table groupe of cowardice, cruelty, and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In this terrible &s;ituation it was, that they im|plored the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Romans for relief; their letter upon this occa&s;ion
&s;till remains upon record: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>To Aetius, thrice Con&s;ul. The groans of the
Britons. Driven by our barbarous enemy to the &s;ea, and from thence back upon
the barbarians, we have only left us the choice of a grave: either to be killed
by the one, or to be drowned by the other.</HI></Q> The Romans, however, were
unable to help them&s;elves, much le&s;s capable of giving &s;uccour to &s;o
remote, and, at pre&s;ent, &s;uch un&s;erviceable allies.</P>
<P>Yet, amid&s;t &s;uch calamities, this people &s;eemed to have
&s;till a peculiar happine&s;s in &s;tore, for they had, in general, embraced
Chri&s;tianity. At what time the Go&s;pel was fir&s;t preached in this i&s;land
is not known, nor is it material to know: it is certain, that England converted
its Pagan con|querors to the lights of revelation; and, though this people
received laws from others, they adorn|ed them with the religion of truth.</P>
<P>Arts, arms, and elegance, mu&s;t take their ri&s;e, by &s;low
degrees, in every country, and can never be, at once, introduced into it with
&s;ucce&s;s. All the pains, be&s;towed in Briti&s;h education, only &s;erved to
render this people more mi&s;erable; dre&s;&s;ed them up as victims for every
invader, and plunged them in all the mi&s;ery of knowing happi|ne&s;s without
being able to enjoy refinement. The people of a country, ju&s;t reclaimed from
barbarity, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble the &s;oil. The cultivation 
<PB N="30" REF="33"> of a few years may be &s;ufficient to clear away the
ob&s;tacles to agriculture, but it requires &s;everal ages, before the land
acquires a proper degree of fertility. Thus, all the blood and trea&s;ure,
which the Romans lo&s;t in the conque&s;t of Britain, in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> only &s;erved to depopulate the

<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember but few in&s;tances in hi&s;tory, where the conquerors
did not excel the people con|quered, in every virtue. Savage barbarity, of
ef|feminate luxury, have almo&s;t ever been imputed to tho&s;e countries which
were obliged to admit a foreign invader. There is a period, between natural
rudene&s;s and exce&s;&s;ive refinement, which &s;eems peculiarly adapted for
conque&s;t and war, and fits mankind for every virtuous and great
atchieve|ment. In this &s;tate of half-refinement, the Saxons were at the time
in which the Britons were thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. This virtuous and warlike
people had conquered wherever they came, and to them the wretched remains of
this forlorn people had re|cour&s;e for protection.</P>
<P>As the conque&s;t of this i&s;land is generally im|puted to the
Saxons as a piece of treachery, and an inva&s;ion of tho&s;e rights they were
only called to protect, I &s;hall give the invitation they received 
<PB N="31" REF="34"> from the Britons, as it hath been left us by
Wit|tichindus, a cotemporary hi&s;torian of credit; and from hence it may be
judged, what little right the Britons had afterwards to complain: 
<Q REND="inline">"The poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Britons, almo&s;t
worn out by ho&s;tile inva&s;ions, and harra&s;&s;ed by continual
in|cur&s;ions, are humble &s;uppliants to you, mo&s;t valiant Saxons, for
&s;uccour. We are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a wide, extended, and a fertile country;
this we yield wholly to be at your devotion and command. Beneath the wing of
your valour, we &s;eek for &s;afety, and &s;hall willingly undergo whatever
&s;ervices you may hereafter be plea&s;ed to impo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>The Saxons were one branch of tho&s;e Gothic nations, which,
&s;warming from the northern hive, came to give laws and liberty to the re&s;t
of Europe. A branch of the&s;e, under the name of Suevi, had, &s;ome time
before Cae&s;ar's inva&s;ion of Gaul, &s;ub|dued and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an
exten&s;ive empire in Germany. The&s;e, for their &s;trength and valour, were
grown formidable to all the German nations. The Sue|vi were reckoned, by their
neighbours, a people for whom the very immortal Gods were not a match in war.
They were after divided into &s;eve|ral nations, and each became famous for
&s;ubduing the country which it invaded. France, Germa|ny, and England, were
among the number of their conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Saxons were far more poli&s;hed than the ancient inhabitants of
Britain, tho' their acquire|ments were much inferior to the boa&s;ted
refinements of Rome. They dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome degree of ele|gance, a luxury
which was unknown to the Bri|tons: the women u&s;ed linen garments, trimmed and
&s;triped with purple; their hair was bound in <PB N="32" REF="35"> wreaths, or
fell in curls upon their &s;houlders; their arms were bare, and their bo&s;oms
uncovered. Fa&s;hions which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;eem peculiar to the ladies
of Britain to this day. Their govern|ments were entirely elective, and nearly
republican; their commanders were cho&s;en by merit, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from
duty when their authority was no longer needful. The cu&s;tom of trying by
twelve men is of Saxon original; &s;lavery, and ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ioin, was
unknown among them, and they preferred death to a &s;hameful exi&s;tence: We
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, by Marcellinus, that a body of
them being taken pri&s;oners by Sym|machus, the Roman, he de&s;igned to exhibit
them, in the amphitheatre, as gladiators, for the enter|tainment of the
citizens of Rome. The morn|ing, however, on which they were expected to
perform, they were every one found dead in his pri&s;on, each chu&s;ing rather
a voluntary death, than to be the ignominious in&s;truments of brutal
&s;atisfaction to their conquerors. The cha&s;tity of this people is equally
remarkable, and to be without children was to be without prai&s;e: but, in war,
they chiefly excelled; they had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, learned di&s;cipline from
the Romans, whom they had often conquered: it was their maxim to e&s;teem
fortune as a doubtful advantage, but courage as a certain good. A nation,
how|ever, entirely addicted to war, mu&s;t, con&s;equent|ly, be addicted to
cruelty; and tho&s;e terrors, which a man is taught not to fear him&s;elf, he
is &s;eldom afraid of inflicting on &s;ociety. The Saxons are repre&s;ented as
a cruel nation, but their enemies alone have drawn the picture.</P>
<P>Vortigern, who had been elected King of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Britons, ea&s;ily induced the&s;e conquerors to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They
came over into Bri|tain <PB N="33" REF="36"> in great numbers, commanded by
Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, of the race of Odin. They marched a|gain&s;t the Picts,
and, in conjunction with the Briti&s;h arms, defeated them in &s;everal
encounters, obliging them to retreat into the mo&s;t northern parts of the
province. The Saxons, thus finding them&s;elves evidently the mo&s;t powerful
people up|on the i&s;land, &s;eemed re&s;olved to reward them|&s;elves with
tho&s;e parts of it which were mo&s;t to their liking. They fir&s;t obtained
con&s;ent from the Britons to &s;end over for more forces, under a pre|tence of
guarding their frontier. The&s;e &s;eated them&s;elves in the northern
provinces, and repre&s;&s;ed the incur&s;ions of the Picts and Scots with great
bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e nations were, there|fore, obliged to bound
their territories with the rough and mountainous countries that lie between the
two &s;eas, and &s;uch have, ever &s;ince, continued the boundaries of England
and Scotland.</P>
<P>The province thus &s;ecured from the common enemy, di&s;&s;en&s;ions
began to ari&s;e between the Bri|tons and their new allies. The Saxons valued
too highly the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had given, and the Bri|tons, perhaps,
under-rated what they had received. In a conte&s;t of this nature, it is
natural to ima|gine, that the &s;tronger nation alwas impo&s;es laws on the
weaker. The Saxons, allured by the fer|tile &s;oil and the &s;oft climate,
continued to invite greater numbers from the continent, and now turned their
arms upon the Britons, who vainly at|tempted to oppo&s;e them. This contention
was &s;till more inflamed by the difference of their opinion in matters of
religion, the Saxons being all Pagans, and the Britons profe&s;&s;ing
Chri&s;tianity. At &s;uch a time as this a Chri&s;tian hero was wanted to
vindicate the rights of Chri&s;tianity, and proba|bly, <PB N="34" REF="37">
merely for this rea&s;on, fiction has &s;upplied us with a Chri&s;tian hero
King Arthur, the Briti&s;h champion, is &s;aid to have wor&s;ted the Saxons in
twelve different engagements; yet, not|with&s;tanding all his victories, and
whatever his prowe&s;s might have performed, it did not &s;erve to re&s;cue his
country from its new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The Saxons pur&s;ued their de&s;igns
with courage and fiercene&s;s; new &s;warms of their countrymen came
continually over, till, at length, in about a cen|tury and an half, they had
&s;ubdued the whole body of the province, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in it &s;even
different kingdoms, which were, by the writers of tho&s;e times, &s;tyled the
Saxon Heptarchy.</P>
<P>The Britons, driven from their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, to
e&s;cape the fury of the conquerors, retired to the mountainous parts of Wales
and Cornwal, countries barren and de&s;olate, but, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
&s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and, towards the land, difficult of acce&s;s. Some
great colonies of them, wholly abandoning their native country, &s;ailed over
to the neighbouring &s;hores of France, where, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing new &s;eats,
they gave a new denomination to that penin&s;ula which &s;till pre&s;erves the
name and memory of Britain there, a name no longer continued at home.</P>
<P>All the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Britons now fell into the power
of the conquerors, who began to lo&s;e their natural fiercene&s;s, and &s;often
into the luxu|ries of tho&s;e they had invaded. Though con|querors ever bring
their own cu&s;toms among the people they &s;ubdue, they, at the &s;ame time,
a&s;|&s;ume &s;ome cu&s;toms from tho&s;e they have conquer|ed. The Saxons now
lo&s;t all that &s;pirit of free|dom their nation had been long famous for,
and, in imitation of the Britons them&s;elves, among <PB N="35" REF="38"> whom
&s;lavery was permitted &s;ince the times of the Romans; they ma 'e the people
of Britain &s;laves. The&s;e wretches were u&s;ed in tilling the ground,
feeding cattle, and other &s;ervile works; farming out lands at a certain
yearly &s;tipend, but always held at the will and plea&s;ure of the landlord.
The children of this mi&s;erable people belonged to the &s;oil, like the re&s;t
of the &s;tock or cattle upon it; and thus began villenage in England, an
horrid cu&s;tom, borrowed from the Romans originally, and derived now to the
Saxon, by vicious imitation.</P>
<P>The Saxons, now no longer fearing dome&s;tic foes, relaxed into
luxury and vice, and, finding no other enemies to &s;ubdue, began to fight with
each other. The Princes of the &s;even kingdoms they had erected, began
mutually to emulate each other's power, and, for the &s;pace of above two
hundred years, all the mi&s;ery that ambition, treachery, or war, could bring
upon a kingdom, was the con|&s;equence of their animo&s;ity. The
di&s;&s;en&s;ions of petty Princes are ever more di&s;tre&s;sful to a people,
than the wars of exten&s;ive empires. The hi&s;to|rians of this period are as
barbarous as the tran&s;|actions they de&s;cribe; but it is &s;ufficient to
know, that, after many various events and revolutions be|tween the &s;everal
races of the heptarchy, Ecbert, de&s;cended from the We&s;t-Saxon Kings, partly
by conque&s;t, and partly by inheritance, became the fir&s;t &s;ole Monarch of
England. This was the name which the country now a&s;&s;umed, to
di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from the principality of Wales, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
ancient Britons, and from that part of the i&s;land north of the Tweed,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Picts and Scots, called Scotland.</P>
<P>No cu&s;toms, truly Briti&s;h or Roman, were now to be &s;een: the
language of the country, which had been either Latin or Celtic, was
di&s;continued, and <PB N="36" REF="39"> the Saxon or Engli&s;h only was
&s;poken. The land, before divided into colonies or governments, was now
cantoned into &s;hires, with Saxon appellations to di&s;tingui&s;h them. Their
habits in peace, and arms in war, their titles of honour, laws, and methods of
trial, were all continued as originally practi&s;ed by the Suevi; but their
commonwealths were now no more; the&s;e were changed for de|&s;potic and
hereditary monarchies: and their exem|plary cha&s;tity, and their abhorrence of
&s;lavery, were quite forgotten. The conquerors were corrupted by pro&s;perity:
they became Chri&s;tians, indeed, by the preaching of Au&s;tin the Monk, but
this little improved their manners; twelve hundred Briti&s;h Monks, who would
not acknowledge Au&s;tin for a &s;aint, are &s;aid to have been &s;laughtered
by order of the&s;e new converted Chri&s;tians, in a field near Caerleon.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, when erroneou&s;ly taught, is even more injurious to
&s;ociety than Pagani&s;m. In all the &s;acrifices made to the Briti&s;h idols,
or the Saxon god Woden, I have not read of &s;uch a multitude of victims
offered together. The devotion of this people, however, was equal to their
ignorance. Their Kings frequently abdicated the crown for the cowl; their
Queens thought it meritorious, though joined in wedlock, to continue in
virgini|ty; and &s;ome, for this erroneous practice, after their death were
canonized as &s;aints.</P>
<P>At this period, namely, the &s;eventh century, the arts and
&s;ciences, which had been before only known in Greece and Rome, were
di&s;&s;eminated over Europe, where they &s;ufficed, indeed, to rai&s;e the
people above natural and &s;avage barbarity, but then they lo&s;t their own
&s;plendor by the tran&s;plan|tation. The Engli&s;h, at the time I am now
&s;peak|ing <PB N="37" REF="40"> of, might be con&s;idered as polite, if
compared to the naked Britons at the inva&s;ion of Cae&s;ar. The hou&s;es,
furniture, cloaths, meetings, and all the luxuries of &s;en&s;e, were almo&s;t
as great then as they are at pre&s;ent; they were only incapable of
&s;entimental plea&s;ure: all the learning of the times was con&s;igned to the
clergy, and little could be expected from their efforts, &s;ince their
principal tenet was to di&s;card the lights of rea&s;on. An eclip&s;e was, even
by their hi&s;torians, talked of as a dangerous omen of threatened
di&s;tre&s;&s;es: and magic was not only believed po&s;&s;ible, but, what is
more &s;trange, there were &s;ome who even fancied they under&s;tood magic. In
&s;hort, this whole pe|riod was ti&s;&s;ued over with ignorance, cruelty, and
&s;uper&s;tition; and the kingdom &s;eemed united un|der one Monarch, only the
more readily to admit a new invader.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IT might have rea&s;onably been expected, that a fortunate prince as
Ecbert had always been, at the head of &s;o large an united kingdom, after the
expul&s;ion of the Picts, Scots, and Britons, &s;hould not only have enjoyed
the fruits of peace, but even have left tranquility and happine&s;s to his
mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity. Yet, &s;uch is the in&s;tability of human
affairs, and the weakne&s;s of man's be&s;t conjecture, that Ecbert was
&s;carcely &s;ettled in his throne, when the whole kingdom was alarmed by the
approach of an unexpected enemy, fierce, barbarous, and brave. About this time
a mighty &s;warm of tho&s;e nations which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the countries
bordering the Baltic, began, under the <PB N="38" REF="41"> names of Danes and
Normans, to infe&s;t the we&s;|tern coa&s;ts of Europe, filling the coa&s;ts
wherever they came with &s;laughter and deva&s;tation. It is remarkable enough,
that the people whom they &s;poiled were no other than colonies of their own
countrymen, who had emigrated &s;ome centuries before, and plundered tho&s;e
very countries, where they were now them&s;elves plundered in turn. The Normans
fell upon the northern coa&s;ts of France. The Danes chiefly levelled their
fury at England, and, entering the Thames with an incredible num|ber of
&s;hips, carried away all that could neither be defended nor withdrawn from the
&s;uddenne&s;s of the inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The weak oppo&s;ition the Danes met with from the Engli&s;h, only
&s;erved to invite them to renew their depredations, and make fre&s;h attempts
the &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;on. The brave&s;t blood of the Engli&s;h had been
already exhau&s;ted in civil war, under the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the Saxon
heptarchy; and, when tho&s;e wars were terminated, pilgrimages, penances,
cloi&s;ters, and &s;uper&s;titions, &s;erved to enfeeble the remainder. Thus
the Saxons were become as unequal to make oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Danes, as
the Britons were to oppo&s;e the Saxons heretofore. They therefore bought off
their in|vaders with money, a remarkable in&s;tance how much they had
degenerated from their warlike an|ce&s;tors. The money which was thus extorted,
only increa&s;ed the avarice and the &s;trength of the enemy. It was al&s;o
rai&s;ed by the Kings, from exactions on the people: this cau&s;ed new
di&s;|content, and &s;erved to ha&s;ten the fall of their thrones, which
already began to totter.</P>
<P>This century, however, did not pa&s;s without various &s;ucce&s;s,
and doubtful fortune, between the two contending nations. No le&s;s than twelve
<PB N="39" REF="42"> battles are &s;aid to have been fought in one year. The
Danes divided their forces into &s;everal camps, removed them from one part of
the country to another, as they were forced by nece&s;&s;ity, invited by hopes
of &s;poil, or induced by the weakne&s;s and divi&s;ions of the enemy. They
fortified po&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ages, built ca&s;tles for the defence of their
borders, and the whole country was, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, covered with their
redoubts, the ve&s;tiges of which remain to this day. This manner of
forti|fying the country, and the difference of religion, &s;eem to be the only
cu&s;toms in which the Danes differed from the Saxons they had invaded. They
were both originally from the &s;ame country, and their manners con&s;equently
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;imilitude of language, laws, and man|ners, &s;oon produced an
intercour&s;e between both nations, and, though they &s;till were enemies, the
Danes gradually began to mingle among the peo|ple of England, and &s;ubmit to
the laws and kings of the country they had partly &s;ubdued. But what concord
could be expected between Chri&s;tians, as the Engli&s;h then were, and Pagans,
for &s;uch the Danes &s;till continued? Wherefore, tho' the Engli&s;h, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, admitted the Danes, yet, &s;till, they hated them: this
produced frequent conte&s;ts, which mo&s;t frequently laid the country in
blood.</P>
<P>In this period of cruelty, jealou&s;y, and de&s;o|lation, a man
&s;eemed rai&s;ed up to his bleeding country, to defend its rights, improve the
age in which he lived, and even to adorn humanity. Alfred the Great was the
fourth &s;on of Ethelwolfe, King of England, and had received the earlier part
of his education under the in&s;pection of Pope Leo, in Rome, which was at that
time the chief &s;eat of arts and learning in Europe. Upon the death of his
elder brother, Ethelred, he was called <PB N="40" REF="43"> to the Engli&s;h
throne, of which he was only no|minally put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the country
being over|run by the Danes, who governed with cruelty and pride.</P>
<P>His reign began with wars, and he was forced into the field
immediately upon his coronation. His fir&s;t battles were fought with merited
&s;ucce&s;s, but, at length, being overpowered by a Dani&s;h combination, the
unfortunate Alfred was obliged to &s;eek &s;afety by flight. In this manner
being a|bandoned by the world, without &s;uccour, and fear|ing an enemy in
every face, the royal fugitive was re&s;olved not to for&s;ake his country, as
was u&s;ual with his predece&s;&s;ors. He retired to the cottage of a cowherd,
in a &s;olitary part of the county of Somer&s;et, at the confluence of the
rivers Parret and Thone: here he lived &s;ix months, as a &s;er|vant, and, as
we are told, was &s;ometimes reproved for his indolence, by his mi&s;tre&s;s,
the cowherd's wife. The Earl of Devon&s;hire was alone privy to the place of
his retreat; and happening to over|throw a body of the Danes, acquainted Alfred
with the news of his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Alfred now, therefore, began to con&s;ider how to turn the pre&s;ent
con&s;ternation of the enemy to his own advantage. He apprized his friends with
the place of his retreat, and in&s;tructed them to be ready, with what troops
they could rai&s;e, upon a minute's warning. But &s;till, none was found who
would undertake to give intelligence of the forces, or po&s;ture of the enemy.
Not knowing, there|fore, who to confide in, he undertook this dange|rous ta&s;k
him&s;elf: in the &s;imple dre&s;s of a &s;hepherd, with an harp in his hand,
he entered the Dani&s;h camp, had admi&s;&s;ion to the principal generals, and
was allowed to excel upon that in&s;trument. He <PB N="41" REF="44"> &s;oon
perceived that they were divided among them|&s;elves; he &s;eizes the
favourable moment, flies to the Earl of Devon&s;hire, heads his troops, forces
their camp, and gains a complete victory.</P>
<P>Alfred knew the arts of negotiation as well as tho&s;e of war; he
had &s;ufficient addre&s;s to cau&s;e him&s;elf to be acknowledged King by the
Danes, as well as his own natural &s;ubjects. London &s;till remained to be
&s;ubdued: he be&s;ieged it, took and fortified it in a manner which was then
thought impregnable. He fitted out a fleet, kept the Danes in his dominions
under proper &s;ubjection, and re|pre&s;&s;ed the inva&s;ions of others from
abroad. His next care was to poli&s;h that country, by the arts of peace, which
he had &s;ubdued by the arts of war. He is &s;aid to have drawn up a body of
laws, but tho&s;e which remain to this day, under his name, &s;eem to be no
more than laws already practifed in the country by his Saxon ance&s;tors, and
to which, probably, he gave his &s;anction. The trial by juries, mulcts and
fines for offences, by &s;ome a&s;cribed to him, are of a much more ancient
date than his reign. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the penal laws of
our ance&s;tors were mild and humane. As a nation becomes more polite, the
penal laws become more numerous and &s;evere, till, at length, growing
intolerable to the poor, again&s;t whom they are principally levelled, they
throw off the yoke of legal bondage, either by admitting a de&s;potic prince,
or by taking the government into their own hands, by military inva&s;ion. I
remem|ber few great characters, in hi&s;tory, that had not a regard for the
&s;ciences. Alfred is &s;aid to have founded the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and
&s;upplied it with books from Rome. The &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition had quite
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the efforts of philo&s;ophy <PB N="42" REF="45"> at that
period: he is &s;aid to have lamented, that no prie&s;t, in all his dominions,
under&s;tood Latin: as for him, he knew it, and was al&s;o well ver&s;ed in the
geometry of tho&s;e barbarous ages. He was an excellent hi&s;torian, made
&s;ome tran&s;lations from the Latin which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t and it is even
&s;aid, that he compo&s;ed &s;ome excellent poems in the Saxon language.
Tho&s;e hours which he could take from bu&s;ine&s;s he gave to &s;tudy. He was
a complete oeconomi&s;t, and this gave him an oppor|tunity of being liberal:
His care even extended to the manner in which the people built their hou&s;es.
Before his time, the generality of the nation made u&s;e of timber, mo&s;tly,
in building: Alfred having rai&s;ed his palaces with brick, the nobility, by
degrees, began to imitate his example.</P>
<P>From his time, though the reigns immediately &s;ucceeding are marked
with ignorance, &s;uper&s;ti|tion, and cruelty, yet, in general, hi&s;tory puts
on a form le&s;s &s;evere: the whole nation &s;eems to emerge into a greater
degree of politene&s;s than it had before enjoyed. The coins of this period are
better &s;truck than tho&s;e of preceding Princes. The marine, in his time,
&s;eems fir&s;t to have given ri&s;e to our claims to the ocean. In &s;hort,
from this period, Engli&s;h hi&s;tory may properly be &s;aid to commence, and
our con&s;titution to take its ri&s;e. We are connected with the events
previous to Alfred's reign, only by motives of curio&s;ity: but, with tho&s;e
that follow him, by the more prevail|ing inducements of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This great man died in the year 900, in the 52d year of his age,
after a reign of more than twenty-eight years; the fir&s;t part &s;pent in war
and di&s;tre&s;s, the latter in peace and pro&s;perity.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HISTORIANS and critics are fond of re|pre&s;enting the period which
&s;ucceeded Alfred, as entirely barbarous: yet, there are many traces of both
erudition and politene&s;s, in tho&s;e very ages which have been particularly
called ob&s;cure. In the reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Edward, we find
gal|lantry, which is one of the be&s;t marks of polite|ne&s;s in any country,
not entirely unknown: his amours with Egwina, who, though by birth a
&s;hepherd's daughter, received an education becom|ing a prince&s;s, and, at
length, &s;ubdued the heart of Edward, is a remarkable in&s;tance of the power
the fair &s;ex then enjoyed. In this reign too, the univer&s;ity of Cambridge
was founded. The fa|mous Scotus flouri&s;hed at this time, a man who&s;e
learning appears amazing, even to an age which prides it&s;elf upon its
erudition.</P>
<P>In the reign of Athel&s;tan, who &s;ucceeded Ed|ward, the Bible was
tran&s;lated into Saxon, a work which at once evinces a ju&s;t opinion, with
regard to religion and the learning of that age. Alliances al&s;o on the
continent were formed by this Monarch; it is &s;aid he was equally feared by
his neighbours, and loved by the greate&s;t Princes of Europe. We find little
remarkable in the reign of Edmund I, but that the fir&s;t capital puni&s;hment
was in&s;tituted by him. He had remarked, that fines and pecu|niary
puni&s;hments were too gentle methods of treat|ing tho&s;e who were convicted
of robberies, who generally were men who had nothing to lo&s;e; he therefore
ordered, that, in gangs of robbers, the olde&s;t of them &s;hould be condemned
to the gallows. <PB N="44" REF="47"> This was reckoned a very &s;evere law at
the time it was in&s;tituted: What would our ance&s;tors &s;ay, upon &s;eeing
the penal laws now u&s;ed by their po&s;|terity!</P>
<P>The death of this Monarch is too remarkable to be pa&s;&s;ed without
notice. His virtues, abili|ties, wealth, and temperance, promi&s;ed a long and
happy reign: when, on a certain day, as he was &s;olemnizing a fe&s;tival in
Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he &s;aw a malefactor, who&s;e name was Leolf, (who had
been bani&s;hed the kingdom for his crimes) &s;itting at one of the tables in
the hall where the King was at dinner. Enraged at &s;uch in&s;olence, he
commanded him to be apprehended; but, perceiv|ing him drawing his dagger, in
order to defend him&s;elf, the King &s;tarted up in a rage, and, catch|ing him
by the hair, dragged him out of the hall. In the mean time Leolf had now drawn
out the dagger, and, lifting his arm, with a furious blow &s;tabbed the Monarch
to the heart, who fell down on the bo&s;om of his murderer.</P>
<P>The Danes, during the&s;e three reigns, were kept within proper
bounds; they frequently revolted, were &s;ubdued, and treated with lenity by
the con|querors. The Monks now began to have the di|rection of affairs, and,
con&s;equently, to enfeeble the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Edred &s;ucceeded Edmund, and began his reign with &s;ome victories
over the Scotch and Danes, which the Monks were &s;kilful enough to attribute
to the miraculous interpo&s;ition of Heaven. Among the number, Dun&s;tan, Abbot
of Gla&s;tonbury, had peculiar influence over the mind of the credulous
Monarch, and, at length, became the director of the affairs of the kingdom. By
this means the Monks acquired &s;uch power, as &s;erved to retard 
<PB N="45" REF="48"> the vigour of every future operation again&s;t the Danes.
However, what they took from the real &s;trength of their country they returned
in appel|lations of honour and re&s;pect. Edred was &s;tyled, <HI>Monarch of
Albion, and King of Great Britain,</HI> and this at a period when his monarchy
was upon the very verge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ruin.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of Edred were &s;et a&s;ide, and Edwy, his elder
brother's &s;on, was placed on the throne. At this time the crown appears to
have been elec|tive, and tho&s;e elections entirely influenced by the clergy.
The Secular prie&s;thood &s;eems to have placed the crown upon this Monarch's
head, in oppo&s;ition to the Monks, who were then ri&s;ing into e&s;teem among
the people. Thus were the Engli&s;h divided by religious di&s;putes, and
involved in all the fury of civil war, while the Danes were every hour growing
in &s;trength, and &s;ending over fre&s;h forces. The Seculars were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the riches of the country, but the Monks, who op|po&s;ed
them, were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power of working miracles. Crucifixes,
altars, and even hor&s;es, were heard to harangue in defence of the Monks, and
inveigh again&s;t the Secular clergy: but particularly Dun&s;tan the Monk had
no &s;mall power over the ho&s;ts of heaven; his illuminations were frequent,
his temptations &s;trong, but he always re|&s;i&s;ted with bravery. The Devil,
&s;ay the Monks, and that &s;eriou&s;ly too, once tempted him in the &s;hape of
a fine woman; but he &s;oon &s;ent him off, by catching him by the no&s;e, and
leading him a|bout for public deri&s;ion. Such &s;tories were then propagated,
and, what is &s;till more extraordinary, were believed. I am the more
&s;urpri&s;ed at the credulity of the times, as the people certainly were not
de&s;titute of cla&s;&s;ical learning, and &s;ome &s;kill <PB N="46" REF="49">
in the polite arts. We have a Latin &s;peech or two &s;till pre&s;erved, which
were &s;poken by their Monarchs at that period, replete with elegance,
per&s;picuity, and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>However that may be, the Monks, by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of
miracles, prevailed: Edwy was de|throned, and his brother Edgar placed in his
room. Hi&s;torians repre&s;ent England, under this reign, as completely happy;
and, it is certain, the king|dom &s;till &s;eemed to enjoy the fruits of
Alfred's wi&s;dom: for, of all the ob&s;cure ages, from the entire decadence of
ta&s;te, till its revival in the fif|teenth century, this might be termed the
Augu&s;|tan. The Engli&s;h fleets are de&s;cribed as amount|ing to above four
thou&s;and &s;hips; Kings came to Edgar's court, and returned without
mole&s;tation or fear. Mu&s;ic, painting, and poetry, were then held as
nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hments to a refined edu|cation, as they are now. But
his gallantries are peculiarly the &s;ubject of the hi&s;torians of that time,
and are &s;till the theme of romance. He is &s;aid, fir&s;t, to have debauched
a nun, then to have attempted the cha&s;tity of a nobleman's daughter; but the
amour, which is famous to this day, is his adventure with the beautiful
Elfrida.</P>
<P>Edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady, who&s;e name was
Elfrida, daughter to the Earl of Devon&s;hire: however, not willing to cre|dit
fame in this particular he &s;ent Ethelwolfe, his favourite, to &s;ee if
Elfrida was indeed that in|comparable woman report had &s;poken her.
Ethel|wolfe had no &s;ooner arrived at the Earl of Devon|&s;hire's, and ca&s;t
his eyes upon that nobleman's beautiful daughter, but he became de&s;perately
enamoured of her him&s;elf: &s;uch was the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, that,
forgetting his ma&s;ter, he de|manded <PB N="47" REF="50"> the beautiful
Elfrida for his own wife. His reque&s;t was granted; the favourite of a King
was not likely to find a refu&s;al, and they were mar|ried in private.
Returning &s;oon after to court, he a&s;&s;ured the King, that Elfrida was much
inferior to the repre&s;entations that had been made of her, and he was amazed
how the world could talk &s;o much of her charms. The King was &s;atisfied, and
no longer felt any curio&s;ity. Ethelwolfe, there|fore, after &s;ome time,
perceiving the King perfect|ly indifferent with regard to the lady,
repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, one day, that, though the fortune of the Earl
of Devon&s;hire's daughter would be a trifle to a Monarch, yet it would be an
immen&s;e &s;um to a needy &s;ubject, and, therefore, he hum|bly prayed leave
to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her, as be|ing the greate&s;t heire&s;s in the
kingdom. A re|que&s;t, &s;o &s;eemingly rea&s;onable, was readily com|plied
with. Ethelwolfe returned to his wife, and their nuptials were &s;olemnized in
public. He had the precaution, however, of not permitting her to appear at
court, before a King &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of love, and &s;he &s;o capable of
in&s;piring pa&s;&s;ion. Not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, it was
impo&s;&s;ible to keep his treachery long concealed. Favourites are never
without private enemies, who de&s;ire an opportunity of ri&s;ing upon their
ruin. Edgar was informed of all, but, di&s;&s;embling his re&s;entment, he took
an occa&s;ion to vi&s;it that part of the coun|try where this miracle of beauty
was detained. Accompanied by his favourite, when he was near the place, he told
him, he had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee his wife, of whom he had formerly heard &s;o
much. Ethelwolfe, thunder&s;truck at the propo&s;al, did all in his power, but
in vain, to di&s;&s;uade him; all he could obtain was leave to go before, on
pretence <PB N="48" REF="51"> of preparing her for the King's reception. On his
arrival, he fell at his wife's fee, confe&s;&s;ing what he had done to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her charms; conjured her to conceal, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, her beauty from the King, who was but too &s;u&s;cep|tible of
pa&s;&s;ion. Elfrida promi&s;ed compliance, but, prompted either by vanity, or
revenge, &s;he adorned her per&s;on with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite art, and called
up all her beauty upon this occa&s;ion. The event an&s;wered her expectations:
the King no &s;ooner &s;aw, but he loved her, and was in&s;tant|ly re&s;olved
to obtain her. The better to effect his de&s;ign, he concealed his
&s;en&s;ations from the hu&s;|band, and took his leave with a &s;eeming
indiffe|rence. Soon after Ethelwolfe was &s;ent to Nor|thumberland, upon
pretence of urgent affairs, but he never performed the journey; he was found
murdered in a wood, by the King's command, who took Elfrida to court, where
their nuptials were celebrated with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>I have been the more explicit in this &s;tory, as, in the fir&s;t
place, it &s;erves to &s;hew, that ladies were admitted to court in this early
period; it al&s;o demon&s;trates, that men and women were never kept &s;eparate
in England, as in Spain and other countries; it &s;till evinces, that, however
polite they might be at the time I am &s;peaking of, there was &s;till a
&s;avage air, that mixed in every action, and &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed
tho&s;e ages of barbari&s;m from the civilized ages of Greece and Rome. But, to
&s;tamp the age with &s;till greater rudene&s;s, Edgar, who was thus guilty of
murder, &s;acrilege, and adultery, was placed among the number of &s;aints, by
the Monks who have written his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The defects of Edgar's government fell upon his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors;
the power of the Monks increa&s;ed, <PB N="49" REF="52"> and that of the
&s;tate was dimini&s;hed in proportion. Every provi&s;ion for the &s;afety of
the kingdom be|gan to decline; and the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Engli&s;h made
way for new incur&s;ions of the Danes, who exacted exorbitant tributes from the
Kings, and plundered the &s;ubjects at di&s;cretion. Edward the Martyr, who had
not the lea&s;t title to &s;o glorious an appellation, was crowned King by the
&s;ingle authority of Dun&s;tan, and, con&s;equently, in|crea&s;ed Monki&s;h
power: he was murdered by order of Elfrida, who &s;eems to have the highe&s;t
contra&s;t, in her own per&s;on, of the greate&s;t exter|nal charms, and the
mo&s;t odious internal defor|mity.</P>
<P>Ethelred II, finding him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e the Danes,
compounded with them for his own &s;afety. But, &s;oon after, being
&s;trengthened by an alliance with the Duke of Normandy, he laid a dete&s;table
&s;cheme for ma&s;&s;acring all the Danes in the kingdom. This plot was carried
on with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that it was executed in one day, and all the Danes in
England were de&s;troyed without mercy. A ma&s;&s;acre, &s;o cruel and
perfidious, in|&s;tead of ending the long mi&s;eries of this wretched country,
only made way for new and greater ca|lamities than before.</P>
<P>Swayne, King of Denmark, exa&s;perated by the &s;laughter of his
countrymen, and, among the re&s;t, of his own &s;i&s;ter, who was beheaded in
Ethelred's pre&s;ence, &s;oon after landed in England, and filled the whole
kingdom with the marks of an horrid vengeance, obliging Ethelred to fly to
Normandy for relief. The Engli&s;h, unable to oppo&s;e, yet unwilling to
&s;ubmit, for a &s;hort time groaned un|der the Dani&s;h yoke, and again, upon
an oppor|tunity given, called their bani&s;hed Monarch back <PB N="50" REF="53"> to his throne. Ethelred returned, but, being a weak, as well as a
cruel Prince, he lo&s;t the hearts of his &s;ubjects, and, with their love, all
his au|thority. He never, therefore, could recover &s;trength enough to
oppo&s;e the forces and numbers of the Danes, to whom many of the Engli&s;h
nobles, as well as commonalty, had, in his ab&s;ence, &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>Swayne was the fir&s;t Dani&s;h Monarch who &s;wayed the Engli&s;h
&s;ceptre, but he died before he could be &s;aid to come to a peaceable
enjoyment of what he had &s;o hardly toiled for. His &s;on Canute, however,
atchieved what the father had begun: Edmund Iron&s;ide, elected by the
Engli&s;h, who was his rival in government, and who &s;ucceeded Ethelred in
this di&s;puted &s;overeignty, continued, for a &s;hort time, to oppo&s;e the
progre&s;s of the Da|ni&s;h conque&s;ts with &s;ucce&s;s; but, Canute gaining a
bloody victory over the forces of this Monarch, he was obliged, fir&s;t, to a
divi&s;ion of the kingdom, and his untimely death, &s;oon after, gave Canute
quiet and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole.</P>
<P>This fierce Monarch cut off &s;ome of the Royal Saxon line, and
forced others into exile. He was at once King of England, Denmark, and Nor|way;
and, from the extent of his dominion, per|haps, rather than from the
greatne&s;s of his mind, he received, from hi&s;torians, the title of
<HI>Canute the Great.</HI> The end of his life, however, was ve|ry different
from the beginning: the fir&s;t part of it was marked with inva&s;ion, rapine,
and cruelty; but the latter equally remarkable for ju&s;tice, humanity, and
religion. Upon a certain occa|&s;ion, being de&s;irous of &s;hewing his
flatterers how l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle he de&s;erved
the exaggerated prai&s;e with which they loaded him, he ordered a chair to be
brought, and, &s;eating him&s;elf on the &s;ea-&s;hore, where the 
<PB N="51" REF="54"> tide was about to flow, he addre&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in this
manner: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O &s;ea, thou art under my dominion, and the
land which I &s;it upon is mine; I charge thee, ap|proach no further, nor dare
to wet the feet of thy Sove|reign:</HI></Q> the tide, however, advancing as
u&s;ual, he turned to his courtiers, and ob&s;erved, that the titles of Lord
and Ma&s;ter only belonged to him whom both earth and &s;eas were ready to
obey.</P>
<P>Harold Harefoot and Hardicanute, his Dani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, were
unworthy of him; the fir&s;t is re|markable for no virtue, and the latter is
di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, principally, for his cruelty and avarice. This la&s;t,
dying &s;uddenly, at a fea&s;t, left the Da|ni&s;h race of Kings &s;o hated, by
their exactions and impo&s;itions on the people, that Edward, &s;ir|named the
Confe&s;&s;or, of the Saxon race, found, both from Danes and Saxons, an ea&s;y
acce&s;&s;ion to the crown.</P>
<P>Thus expired, not only the dominion, but all attempts or inva&s;ions
of the Danes for the future. Though their ravages had continued for above two
hundred years, yet they left no change of laws, cu&s;toms, language, or
religion. The many ca&s;tles they had built, and the many families they left
behind them, &s;erved alone to di&s;cover the places of their
e&s;tabli&s;hment. After the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or to the
crown, the Engli&s;h and Danes, as if wearied with mutual &s;laughter, united
to &s;upport his government, and, peace|ably living among&s;t each other,
formed ever after but one people.</P>
<P>The reign of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or was long and happy. He had
lived long in Normandy, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, adopted the language and
learning of that country. His wars were &s;ucce&s;s|ful, both in Scotland and
Wales, though managed <PB N="52" REF="55"> by his leaders, and without his
per&s;onal attendance. The ea&s;ine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, however,
together with his credulity and &s;uper&s;tition, paved the way for another
inva&s;ion of his country, as if the Eng|li&s;h were de&s;tined to be governed
only by foreign ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Earl Godwin, by who&s;e intere&s;t Edward had come to the crown,
exerted all his influence to e&s;tabli&s;h his own &s;on, Harold, as his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. This too powerful &s;ubject pretended to be much
di&s;plea&s;ed at the favour &s;hewn, by the King, to the Norman nobility, who
came over, in numbers, to the Engli&s;h court. The&s;e di&s;contents at length
produced an in&s;urrection. Edward, now grown old, and indolent by nature,
undertook to oppo&s;e tho&s;e di&s;orders, rather by negotiations than arms.
Treating with rebels is a certain method of in|crea&s;ing their power: by this
means Harold gain|ed, by degrees, the authority he contended for, and had power
&s;ufficient to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While Edward was thus leaving his earthly kingdom to contention and
mi&s;ery, he was, in the mean time, bu&s;ily employed in gaining, as he
imagined, an heavenly one. It was not &s;ufficient for him to a&s;pire to all
the virtues nece&s;&s;ary for carrying him to heaven; he de&s;ired to be
reckoned a &s;aint of the fir&s;t order. He pretended to &s;everal revelations,
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the gift of prophecy, and was the fir&s;t who touched
for tho&s;e &s;crophu|lous di&s;orders, which, from hence, have been
de|nominated the King's Evil. But what gained him a di&s;tingui&s;hed place
among the &s;aints, was his continence, his refraining from the woman to whom
he was actually married. It is &s;aid he e&s;|pou&s;ed the beautiful Editha,
purely to exerci&s;e his <PB N="53" REF="56"> virtues, by with&s;tanding a
continual temptation. This, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, left her to &s;terility, and
thus his leaving no i&s;&s;ue was the cau&s;e of num|berle&s;s mi&s;eries which
fell upon the kingdom &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Edward, as I ob&s;erved, had no children. He &s;eemed, however,
de&s;irous of leaving the crown to his nephew Edgar Atheling; but,
di&s;tru&s;ting his weakne&s;s to defend this title, and knowing the &s;trength
of Harold, his opponent, he left the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion undecided. It is
probable, however, this weak Monarch was no way &s;ollicitous who &s;uc|ceeded
in a government which he &s;eemed him&s;elf to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the death of Edward, Harold now al|ledged that he was
appointed, by will, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This was no more than what the peo|ple
of England had expected long before; his pre|ten&s;ions were believed by
&s;ome, and allowed by all. He had &s;ome right to a crown, hitherto elective,
from his private virtues; and he confirm|ed his rights by the mo&s;t
irre&s;i&s;tible argument, his power. Thus this Monarch came to the throne by
the mo&s;t equitable of all titles, I mean, the con&s;ent of the people.</P>
<P>His exaltation &s;eemed only to be the commence|ment of his
calamities. His fir&s;t trouble was from his own brother, who, being the elder,
obtained a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Norway to &s;et up a title to the Engli&s;h
crown. Harold immediately levied a nu|merous army, and marched to meet the
Norwe|gians, <PB N="54" REF="57" MS="y"> who, with a va&s;t force, had overrun
all the northern parts of the kingdom, and had committed incredible
deva&s;tation. Both armies &s;oon joined battle; the Norwegians, for &s;ome
time, bravely defended a bridge which lay between them, but, at length, the
valour of the Engli&s;h &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle. Harold pa&s;&s;ed the
bridge, renew|ed the a&s;&s;ault, and, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance,
entirely routed the invaders. There had never before been &s;een in England an
engagement be|tween two &s;uch numerous armies, each having no le&s;s than
three&s;core thou&s;and men. The news of this victory diffu&s;ed the greate&s;t
joy over the whole kingdom; but their raptures were &s;oon &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by
an information, that William of Nor|mandy, &s;irnamed the Conqueror, had landed
at Ha&s;tings, with a va&s;t body of di&s;ciplined veterans, and laid claim to
the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>This Prince was the natural &s;on of Robert Duke of Normandy: his
mother's name was Ar|lette, a beautiful maid of Falaize, with whom Robert fell
in love, as &s;he &s;tood gazing at her door whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed through the
town. William, who was the offspring of this amour, owed his great|ne&s;s to
his birth, and his fortunes to his per&s;onal merit. His body was vigorous, his
mind capa|cious, and his courage not to be intimidated. His father, Robert,
growing old, and, as was u&s;ual with Princes of that age, &s;uper&s;titious,
re&s;olved upon a vi&s;it to the Holy Sepulchre at Jeru&s;alem. The nobility
u&s;ed every argument to di&s;&s;uade him, but the per&s;i&s;ted in his
de&s;ign. He &s;hewed them William, whom, though illegitimate, he tenderly
loved, recommending him to their care and loyal|ty. He then exacted their
homage and fealty to this Prince, not yet above ten years old; and then 
<PB N="55" REF="58"> put him under the tutelage of the French King, in whom he
placed the highe&s;t confidence.</P>
<P>Robert, &s;oon after going into A&s;ia, and dying, left his &s;on
rather inheritor of his wi&s;hes than his crown. Our young &s;oldier found
him&s;elf at once expo&s;ed to many dangers, from his youth and in|experience,
from the reproach of his birth, a &s;u&s;|pected guardian, a di&s;puted title,
and a di&s;tracted &s;tate. However, he &s;urmounted all with uncom|mon
fortitude and bravery, nor, till he had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed peace, order, and
tranquillity, in his own kingdom, did he turn his ambitious views abroad.</P>
<P>It has been already &s;een, that Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or, in
flying from his enemies, re&s;ided for a long time at the court of Robert, Duke
of Nor|mandy; and upon this William founded his claim. Whether gratitude might
engage this exiled Prince to make William, his benefactor's &s;on, any
pro|mi&s;es of the kingdom of England, after his de|cea&s;e, is, at this
di&s;tance of time, uncertain: William, however, upon the death of Edward,
immediately made his preten&s;ions, and, upon the former promi&s;e of Edward,
founded all the ju&s;tice of his demaud. To this he added, that Harold had
him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured him of his intere&s;t in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, when
forced upon the Norman coa&s;t; and he therefore &s;ent to remind him of
fulfilling his engagements.</P>
<P>Harold admitted of neither of the&s;e claims, and re&s;olved to
defend, by his valour, what he had acquired by his intrigues. He was at the
head of a large army, lately victorious, and now confident. He ob&s;erved, that
he had been elected by tho&s;e who only had the power of placing Kings on the
throne, namely, by the people; and that he could not re&s;ign his crown without
a breach of <PB N="56" REF="59"> that tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by his
con&s;tituents. He added to the&s;e rea&s;ons one of &s;till greater weight, he
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, and knew how to de|fend his property.</P>
<P>William, who had landed his army at Ha&s;tings in Su&s;&s;ex, about
the beginning of October, at fir&s;t made no appearance of invading an
ho&s;tile country, but rather of incamping in his own. But he was &s;oon
rou&s;ed from his inactivity by the approach of Harold, who returned from the
de|feat of the Norwegians, with all the forces he had employed in that
expedition, and all he could invite, or collect, in the country through which
he pa&s;&s;ed. The&s;e were, in general, brave, active, and valiant troops, in
high &s;pirits, &s;trongly attach|ed to their King, and eager to engage. The
ar|my of William, on the other hand, con&s;i&s;ted of the flower of all the
continent: the troops of Bre|tagne, Brabant, Bologne, Flanders, Poictou, Maine,
Orleans, France, and his own, were united under his command. He had long been
familiar with conque&s;t, and his troops were confident of his military
capacity. England, ne|ver before, nor ever &s;ince, &s;aw two &s;uch armies
drawn up to di&s;pute its crown. The day before the battle William &s;ent an
offer to Harold, to de|cide the quarrel between them by &s;ingle combat, and
thus &s;pare the blood of their people; but Ha|rold refu&s;ed, and &s;aid he
would leave it to God to determine. Both armies, therefore, that night pitched
in &s;ight of each other, expecting the next terrible day with &s;ollicitude:
the Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;ongs and fea&s;ting, the Normans in
de|votion and prayer.</P>
<P>The next morning, at &s;even, as &s;oon as day appeared, both armies
drew up in array again&s;t <PB N="57" REF="60"> each other. Harold appeared,
leading on the centre of the Engli&s;h army, on foot, that his men might be
more encouraged by &s;eeing their King expo&s;ed to equal danger with
them&s;elves. William fought on hor&s;eback, and commanded the body of
re&s;erve. The Normans began the fight with their cro&s;s-bows; the&s;e at
fir&s;t galled and &s;urprized the Engli&s;h, and, as their ranks were clo&s;e,
the arrows did great execution: but, when they came to clo&s;e fight, the
Normans were hewn down by the Engli&s;h bills, which, of all weapons, inflicted
the mo&s;t terrible and gha&s;tly wounds. William, endeavouring to pierce their
ranks, a&s;|&s;aulted them &s;o often, and with &s;uch bravery, that he had
three hor&s;es killed in the attempt. Perceiving that they &s;till continued
impenetrable, he now pretended to fly; this drew the Engli&s;h from their
ranks, and he was in&s;tantly ready to take advantage of their di&s;order. Upon
a &s;ignal given, the Normans returned to the charge with greater fury than
before, broke the Engli&s;h troops, and pur&s;ued them to a ri&s;ing ground.
Harold now flew from rank to rank, though he had toiled all day, from morning
till now near night-fall, in the front of his Kenti&s;h men; yet &s;till he
conti|nued, with unabated vigour, to renew the fight, and exhort his men by his
voice and example. The day now again &s;eemed to turn again&s;t the victors,
and the Normans fell in great numbers. The fiercene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of this
memorable battle was often renewed by the courage of the leaders, wherever that
of the &s;oldiers began to &s;lacken. Fortune, at length, determined a
victo|ry, that valour was unable to decide: Harold, making a furious on&s;et at
the head of his troops, was &s;hot into the brains by an arrow. All the 
<PB N="58" REF="61"> courage of the Engli&s;h expired with their brave, but
unfortunate, leader. He fell with his &s;word in his hand, fighting for his
country, amid&s;t the heaps of &s;lain, &s;o that the royal corp&s;e could
hard|ly, after the battle, be di&s;tingui&s;hed among the dead.</P>
<P>This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England, which had
continued for more than &s;ix hundred years. Before the times of Alfred the
Kings &s;eemed totally immer&s;ed in ignorance; and, after him, taken up with
combating &s;uper|&s;tition, or blindly obeying its dictates. As for the crown,
it was rather bequeathed by its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to whom he thought proper,
than tran&s;mitted by he|reditary and natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. As for the laws
and cu&s;toms of this race, they brought in many of their own, and adopted
&s;everal of the ancient Btitons and Romans, which they found in the country
upon their inva&s;ion. They a&s;&s;umed the name of Kings, nay, &s;ome took the
Greek appel|lation of Ba&s;ileus, titles unknown in the country from whence
they came. Their Earls were called Dukes, or Duces, a name borrowed from the
Romans, and &s;ignifying Captains. The lower cla&s;&s;es of people were bought
and &s;old with the farms they cultivated; a cu&s;tom fir&s;t introduced by the
conquerors of the world, and which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome countries, where
the Roman laws continue, to this day. Their canon laws al&s;o at that time were
often mixed with their civil laws, and were equally coercive; but the&s;e canon
laws had their origin from Rome, and the Prie&s;ts and Monks, who drew them up,
generally had their education there. We mu&s;t not, therefore, a&s;cribe all
the laws and cu&s;toms, which at that time prevailed over England, to a Saxon
original, &s;ince they were, <PB N="59" REF="62"> in &s;ome ca&s;es, derived
from the Britons and Ro|mans. But now all tho&s;e cu&s;toms and laws, of
whatever original, were ca&s;t down into one com|mon ma&s;s, and cemented by
tho&s;e of Norman in|&s;titution. The whole face of obligation was changed, and
new ma&s;ters and new forms ob&s;erved. The laws were improved, but the ta&s;te
of the people for polite learning, arts, and philo&s;ophy, for more than four
hundred years to come, were &s;till to continue the &s;ame. It is, indeed,
&s;urprizing, that in &s;uch a variety of events, &s;uch innovations in
manners, and &s;uch changes in government, true politene&s;s never came to be
cultivated. Perhaps the rea&s;on may be, that the people &s;uffered
them|&s;elves to be in&s;tructed only by the clergy, and the clergy have a
certain &s;tandard of politene&s;s which they never go beyond, and at which
they were arrived at the time we are &s;peaking of. A Monk of the tenth
century, and a Monk of the eighteenth century, are equally enlightened with
&s;cience, and equally fit to promote the arts of happine&s;s. I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU now enter upon that part of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which gives
birth to our pre&s;ent hap|py con&s;titution. Tho&s;e laws, which are &s;o much
e&s;teemed by the re&s;t of Europe; tho&s;e liberties, which are &s;o dear to
us at home, begin to dawn at this period. The Engli&s;h, hitherto almo&s;t
un|known to the re&s;t of the world, began, after this <PB N="60" REF="63">
revolution, to make a con&s;iderable figure in Europe. The variety of
di&s;po&s;itions of &s;everal foreign coun|tries, being imported here, blended
into one com|mon national character, and produced &s;entiments of courage,
freedom, irre&s;olution, and pride.</P>
<P>Immediately after the victory at Ha&s;tings, in which, it is &s;aid,
&s;ixty thou&s;and Engli&s;h were &s;lain, the Conqueror marched towards
London. He car|ried before him a &s;tandard which had been ble&s;&s;ed by the
Pope, and to this all the clergy quickly re|&s;orted. The Bi&s;hops and
Magi&s;trates of the me|tropolis came out to meet him, and offer him a crown
which they no longer had in their power to refu&s;e. William was glad of thus
peaceably be|ing put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a throne, which &s;everal of his
predece&s;&s;ors had not gained but by repeated victories; he complied with the
terms which were offered him, and, among the&s;e terms, it is to be pre&s;umed,
the Church's intere&s;ts were not for|gotten. Though William had it in his
power to force the people into a compliance with his views, yet he cho&s;e to
have their election of him con&s;i|dered as a voluntary gift of their own. He
knew him&s;elf to be their conqueror; he de&s;ired to be thought their lawful
King.</P>
<P>Thus was William po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an idea of his own power to
enforce obedience; and the Eng|li&s;h of their own genero&s;ity, in having
freely pre&s;ented him with a crown. Impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch oppo&s;ite
&s;entiments, the one was inclined to op|pre&s;s a people, whom he, in fact,
thought inca|pable of re&s;i&s;tance; and they, on the other hand, were
inclined to revolt again&s;t one, whom they fancied to have had received, from
their own hands, all authority. Numberle&s;s, therefore, were the
in&s;urrections of the Engli&s;h again&s;t their <PB N="61" REF="64"> new
Monarch; and every &s;uppre&s;&s;ed rebellion on|ly gave fre&s;h in&s;tances of
the Conqueror's mild|ne&s;s and humanity. The Engli&s;h were unwilling to pay
any taxes, towards inriching tho&s;e they now began to look upon as conquerors;
and Wil|liam was under the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements of providing for tho&s;e
adventurers who had left their native country to place him on the throne.</P>
<P>Hitherto William had acted like one who was rather the father than
the invader of the country, when news was brought him, that a body of
Nor|thumbrian Engli&s;h, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Danes, had &s;et upon the Norman
garri&s;on in York ca&s;tle, and put every man to the &s;word. After repeated
re|bellions, which he had quelled before, and &s;uch frequent pardons, which
were the con&s;equence, he now found that nothing but rigour would do for the
future. He marched therefore to meet the enemy, bought off the Danes for a
&s;um of money, and took a &s;ignal revenge upon the Northumbrians, unable to
oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>From this time he &s;eems to have regarded Eng|land rather as a
conque&s;t than a ju&s;tly acquired dominion. His diffidence of the Engli&s;h
became more con&s;picuous every day, and his partiality to the Normans more
galling. All places of tru&s;t and confidence were taken from the one and given
to the other: from this time he thought only of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf on
the throne, without nicely examining whether the means were con&s;onant to
ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>
<P>If hi&s;torians, who &s;eem partial in other re|&s;pects, are to be
credited, England was then in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation. The Normans
com|mitted continual in&s;ults on the conquered people, and they &s;eldom found
any redre&s;s from their go|vernors; <PB N="62" REF="65"> in both ca&s;es,
therefore, they generally revenged them&s;elves by private murders, and a day
&s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed but the bodies of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Nor|mans were found
in the woods and highways, without any po&s;&s;ibility of bringing the
perpetrators to ju&s;tice. But what is repre&s;ented as the pecu|liar grievance
of the times, was, that the Engli&s;h were deprived of arms, and were forbid
having any lights in their hou&s;es after eight o'clock in the evening. At this
hour a bell was rung to warn them to put out their fire and candle; and this,
which was called the Curfew, was very grating to the ears of the people.</P>
<P>In&s;urrections are ever the con&s;equence of op|pre&s;&s;ion, in a
brave nation; William was &s;en&s;ible of this, and generally attempted to
moderate the cruel coun&s;els of his countrymen by a gentle treatment of the
offenders. Edgar Atheling, who had the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ive right to the
crown, was among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who experienced his lenity and
faith. This Prince had gone over to the Scotch, and had per&s;uaded their King
to join him, with an army, in a&s;&s;erting his right to the Engli&s;h crown.
William met their forces in the northern parts of England, and, in&s;tead of a
bat|tle, propo&s;ed a negotiation. Peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two
nations, and Edgar was included in the treaty. He continued, from that time, to
live, as a private man, in opulence and &s;ecurity, and pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t
of his life, perhaps, more hap|pily than if he had continued in the career of
his ambition.</P>
<P>William, having nothing at pre&s;ent to fear from war, turned all
his thoughts to the arts of peace. He was not yet &s;ufficiently arbitrary to
change all the laws, now in being, for tho&s;e of his own <PB N="63" REF="66">
country: he only made &s;everal innovations, and ordered all law pleas, in the
&s;everal courts, to be made in the Norman language. The&s;e precautions,
in&s;tead of making the Norman language the &s;tudy of all, confined the law to
the peculiar &s;tudy of a few. The Engli&s;h language &s;till continued to be
&s;poken; and, &s;uch was the e&s;teem it was held in, even &s;o early, that it
began to be &s;poken at the court of Scotland, and in &s;everal adjacent
coun|tries; and never was the French le&s;s engrafted up|on our language, than
at this very time when they were our ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>William now thought proper to deprive Bi&s;hops of all judgment in
civil ca&s;es, which they had en|joyed during the whole Saxon &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
from their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity. He re&s;trained the clergy to the
exerci&s;e of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical power alone. He endeavoured to aboli&s;h
trials by <HI>Ordeal</HI> and <HI>Camp Fight.</HI> The Ordeal trial, which had
been a remainder of Pagan &s;uper&s;tition, and &s;till was held in veneration
by the Saxons, was either by fire or water. It was u&s;ed in criminal ca&s;es,
where the &s;u&s;picions were &s;trong, but the proofs not evident. In that of
fire, the per&s;on accu&s;ed was brought into an open plain, and &s;everal
plough|&s;hares, heated red hot, were placed at equal in|tervals before him:
over the&s;e he was to walk blindfold, and, if he e&s;caped unhurt, he was
ac|quitted of the charge. In the other trial of wa|ter, the accu&s;ed was
thrown into the water: if he &s;unk, he was declared innocent; but, if he
&s;wam, guilty.</P>
<P>The trial of <HI>Camp Fight</HI> was another in&s;tance of the
deplorable barbarity of the times. This was performed by &s;ingle combat, in
li&s;ts, appoint|ed for that purpo&s;e, between the accu&s;er and the 
<PB N="64" REF="67"> accu&s;ed: he that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, came off
victo|rious, was deemed innocent; and he who was conquered, if he &s;urvived
his antagoni&s;t's re&s;ent|ment in the field, was &s;ure to &s;uffer, as a
male|factor, &s;ome time after. Both the&s;e trials this King aboli&s;hed as
unchri&s;tian and unju&s;t, and re|duced all cau&s;es to the judgment of twelve
men, of a rank nearly equal to that of the pri&s;oner. This number was called a
Jury, and this was a method of trial common to the Saxons and Nor|mans long
before, but confirmed by him with all the &s;anction of royalty.</P>
<P>Having continued thirteen years in England, he now thought of
re-vi&s;iting his native dominions: but, no &s;ooner was his back turned, when
a new con&s;piracy was &s;et on foot. This was more terrible, as it was carried
on by the joint coun&s;els of Nor|mans as well as Engli&s;h: &s;everal Lords,
of both nations, already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of opulence, were de|&s;irous of
independence al&s;o; and pretended many grievances, or imagined them&s;elves
aggrieved. The Earl Walthof, who had been formerly pardon|ed for a like
offence, entered &s;ecretly into a cor|re&s;pondence with Swayne, King of
Denmark, and Drone, King of Ireland. Their mea&s;ures were conceived with
caution, and pur&s;ued with &s;ecrecy; but &s;ome delays, intervening, were
fatal to coun|&s;els which were entru&s;ted, nece&s;&s;arily, to many: the plot
was di&s;covered &s;ome days before the Danes arrived; the heads of the
con&s;piracy were taken, and Fitz-Auber, a noble Norman, and Walthof, were
beheaded upon this occa&s;ion. Whether this act of rigour was executed by the
King's com|mand, &s;ent over from Normandy, or by Odon, his brother, left
behind, and naturally inclined to &s;everity, is not apparent. However, the&s;e
two <PB N="65" REF="68"> were the only noblemen executed in England du|ring the
reign of William the Conqueror, not|with&s;tanding &s;o many revolts on their
&s;ide, and &s;o much power in him to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>Though good fortune &s;eemed to attend this Mo|narch thus far on his
reign, here the curtain may be drawn for the re&s;t. His decline was marked
with dome&s;tic quarrels, which could neither end in glory nor in gain; his
endeavours were oppo&s;ed by his own &s;ubjects, for whom he had laboured with
&s;uch per&s;everance. He had four &s;ons, Ro|bert, Richard, William, and
Henry, be&s;ides &s;e|veral daughters. The mo&s;t poignant of his
di&s;|tre&s;&s;es mu&s;t, therefore, come from that quarter, where he lea&s;t
expected an attack, and was lea&s;t guarded to oppo&s;e. His elde&s;t &s;on,
Robert, en|couraged by the King of France, pretended a right to po&s;&s;e&s;s
Normandy, even during the life of his father. William could place confidence in
none but the Engli&s;h, to bring this unnatural &s;on to his duty; and, drawing
an army of Engli&s;hmen together, he pa&s;&s;ed over into Normandy, to put a
&s;top to the progre&s;s of &s;o unexpected an in&s;urrec|tion. It is
remarkable enough, that the &s;ame commander, who formerly led over an army of
Normans to conquer England, now returned with an army of Engli&s;h to &s;ubdue
Normandy. To re|duce his &s;on, however, was found a much more difficult ta&s;k
than William had at fir&s;t expected. Robert &s;eemed to inherit, though not
his father's virtues, at lea&s;t his conduct and intrepidity. He led on his
troops with courage, and laid his am|bu&s;cades with &s;ecrecy: In one of
the&s;e, after he had killed part of a troop of Engli&s;h, and put the re&s;t
to flight, he boldly advanced again&s;t the main body, where William commanded
in per&s;on. By <PB N="66" REF="69"> a &s;trange fatality of circum&s;tances,
the father and &s;on were oppo&s;ed, without knowing each other. William was
now grown old, and unable to perform tho&s;e extraordinary feats, for which he
was once &s;o famous. The &s;on charged with &s;uch fury, that his aged father
fell to the ground with the blow: death would inevitably have been the
con&s;equence, and the &s;on's arm was ju&s;t lifted to &s;trike his fa|ther,
had not William called out, and Robert im|mediately recollected his father's
voice. At once, &s;tung with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crime, and his duty,
he leaped from his hor&s;e, and rai&s;ed the fallen Monarch from the ground;
then, pro&s;trating him|&s;elf in his pre&s;ence, he a&s;ked pardon for his
of|fences, and promi&s;ed, for the future, an adhe|rence to his duty. The King,
moved by the im|pul&s;e of nature, took once more his long lo&s;t &s;on to his
arms, and the armies, &s;pectators of this moving &s;cene, participated in
their joy and recon|ciliation.</P>
<P>But this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Robert was of no long continuance; he
once had ta&s;ted the &s;weets of power, and knew not how to &s;ubmit to
&s;ubordina|tion: again, therefore, he revolted, and again was pardoned by his
indulgent father. But the French, who in&s;pired him to the&s;e acts of
di&s;obedience, and were at be&s;t in&s;idious allies, particularly felt the
vehemence of William's di&s;plea&s;ure. After he had adju&s;ted the government
of England, to which he was returned &s;ome time before, he again led over a
brave army of Engli&s;hmen into Normandy, in|tent to make the &s;torm fall upon
tho&s;e who were primarily the di&s;turbers of his tranquillity. The King of
France rightly con&s;idered, that this ar|mament could only be de&s;igned
again&s;t him&s;elf, and attempted to divert it by a truce, which was 
<PB N="67" REF="70"> agreed on, but a je&s;t of the French King's &s;erved to
renew ho&s;tilities. William had been confined to his bed by an
indi&s;po&s;ition, which, added to his natural corpulency, threatened the
mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. This was a &s;ituation which it was cruelty to
ridicule; however, the Frenchman, with a levity natural to his nation,
ob&s;erved, that the King of England was lying-in of a big belly. This rai&s;ed
William's indignation to &s;uch a pitch, that he immediately took the field,
where, leap|ing a ditch, the pomel of the &s;addle brui&s;ed his belly, and
gave him a rupture. This, added to his former bad habit of body, brought on a
morti|fication, of which he died.</P>
<P>The characters of Princes are be&s;t &s;een in their actions, nor is
it nece&s;&s;ary to give an outline at the end of what the hi&s;torian has
painted more &s;trongly in his narration. There is &s;carce a great quality
which this Monarch does not &s;eem emi|nently to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and,
con&s;idering the mo|rality of the times, &s;carce a good one in which he was
entirely deficient. The only objections of any weight, are his avarice and his
depopulating a part of this country, in order to make a fore&s;t to hunt in for
his amu&s;ement. The avarice of Kings, at that time, was different from what it
is now. Kings acquired money then for the u&s;es of the public; Kings acquire
fortunes now only for them&s;elves: the wars of the &s;tate were then
&s;up|plied by trea&s;ures of the crown; the wars of the &s;tate at pre&s;ent
are &s;upplied by finances appropriated to that purpo&s;e by the people. His
making &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a fore&s;t can be vindicated only from the barbarity
of the times; a method rather of making his guilt general, than of wiping it
away. Upon the whole, however, England &s;eemed to improve <PB N="68" REF="71">
by the conque&s;t, and lo&s;t neither its name nor its language. It increa&s;ed
in &s;trength and naval power; its laws became more numerous and ra|tional; the
manner of living, among the natives, more elegant and expen&s;ive, and the
&s;uper&s;tition of the clergy le&s;s gro&s;s and ab&s;urd.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEW nations have gone through more revo|lutions; few governments
have appeared more un&s;teady, or fluctuated more, between prerogative and
privilege, than this of Great Britain. The Engli&s;h have been &s;urprized,
betrayed, forced in|to &s;ituations little preferable to downright &s;lavery;
but tho&s;e convul&s;ions, though they have di&s;or|dered the frame, yet could
not de&s;troy the princi|ples of a free con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Norman alter the whole model of government, but
he was unable to extingui&s;h the Saxon &s;pirit of freedom, which formed its
ground-work: on the contrary, the Normans, and other &s;trangers who &s;ettled
here, were &s;oon &s;eized with a &s;pirit of liberty them&s;elves, in&s;tead
of being able to communicate their native principles of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>William left three &s;ons: Robert, to whom he bequeathed his Dukedom
of Normandy; William Rufus, who had the newly acquired kingdom of England; and
Henry, who was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of his
per&s;onal trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>William Rufus, upon coming to the crown, had two very powerful
parties to oppo&s;e and to humble. <PB N="69" REF="72"> The nobility, who
&s;till a&s;pired to the &s;ame degree of freedom which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
under the Saxon Kings; and the clergy, who de&s;ired to erect them|&s;elves
into a di&s;tinct government, independent of Secular power. One or the other of
the&s;e claims, gave ri&s;e to the in&s;urrections and di&s;contents of this
reign. Nothing can be more ea&s;y than to imagine, how ill a people, who
thought them&s;elves free, mu&s;t brook a Monarch who looked upon them as his
property, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion originally founded in conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Odo, his own uncle, was the fir&s;t to di&s;pute his title; but he
was &s;oon taken pri&s;oner, and, &s;ome time after, contrived means of flying
into Normandy, where he found protection and honour from Duke Robert. This was
a &s;ufficient pretext for William to make war upon his brother: it was carried
on with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s. Henry, the third brother, was al&s;o involved
in this war, &s;eparately, and upon his own account, having taken up arms for
not being paid tho&s;e trea&s;ures bequeath|ed him by his father. Thus were
there three dif|ferent armies, each exa&s;perated again&s;t the other, and each
led on by one of tho&s;e di&s;united brothers. Such an unnatural conte&s;t, as
my ea&s;ily be con|ceived, &s;erved only to weaken them&s;elves, and
&s;trengthen their enemies. The Scotch and Welch, therefore, took this
opportunity to make &s;everal incur&s;ions upon the Engli&s;h, while William
was thus pur&s;uing conque&s;ts that could end neither in advantage nor fame.
To increa&s;e the confu&s;ion, the clergy loudly complained of incroachments
upon their privileges: the people murmured at every increa&s;e of their taxes;
Robert de Mowbray was actually taken pri&s;oner, while he commanded a
fortre&s;s that had &s;haken off the royal authority. <PB N="70" REF="73"> What
effects the&s;e di&s;contents, which were in|crea&s;ed al&s;o by the King's
avarice, intemperance, and prodigality, might have produced, is uncer|tain, the
mo&s;t melancholy were expected; but now the attention of all Europe was called
off to one of the mo&s;t remarkable events that hi&s;tory can produce, I mean
the arming for the fir&s;t Cru&s;ade.</P>
<P>Peter, &s;irnamed the Hermit, who had beheld, with indignation, the
cruel manner in which the Infidels, who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy
Se|pulchre, treated the Chri&s;tians who went on pil|grimages thither, returned
to Europe, re&s;olved to in&s;pire the Princes of Chri&s;tendom with a zeal for
its recovery. Bareheaded and barefoot, he tra|velled from court to court,
preaching, as he went, and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people. Pope
Urban II. preached the Cru&s;ade him&s;elf at the council of Clermont, and
numberle&s;s per&s;ons, of all degrees and nations, ardently embraced the
cau&s;e, and put on the red cro&s;s, the badge of their profe&s;&s;ion. Among
this number was Robert, Duke of Normandy: he was brave, zealous, fond of glory,
and &s;till more fond of change. In order to &s;upply money to defray the
nece&s;&s;ary charges of &s;o expen&s;ive an undertaking, he offered to
mort|gage his dukedom with his brother, for a &s;tipulated &s;um. William
eagerly embraced the propo&s;al: he was no way &s;ollicitous about rai&s;ing
the money agreed on, for he knew the riches of his clergy: heedle&s;s,
therefore, of their murmurs, he rigo|rou&s;ly levied the whole, making u&s;e of
the mo&s;t pious pretences to cover his extortion. Thus, &s;end|ing his brother
to the Holy Land, he took peace|able po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dukedom.</P>
<P>In this manner was Normandy again united to the Engli&s;h crown, and
from this union afterwards <PB N="71" REF="74"> aro&s;e tho&s;e wars with
France, which for whole cen|turies continued to depopulate both nations,
with|out conducing in the end to the inriching of either.</P>
<P>William was not a little plea&s;ed with this un|expected
acqui&s;ition; and, as one &s;ucce&s;s only pro|duces a de&s;ire of more, he
began to conceive more exten&s;ive &s;chemes of ambition. Poictou and Guienne
were offered to be mortgaged for the &s;ame rea&s;ons as Normandy. William
immediately rai&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary &s;um, but death interrupted the
payment. Happening to hunt in that fore&s;t, from whence his father had
bani&s;hed the hu&s;bandman and legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, he was accidentally
&s;hot thro' the heart, with an arrow, by one Tyrrel: he died in the
forty-fourth year of his age, reigned twelve, and left a dominion which he had
contributed to ex|tend, to impoveri&s;h, and in&s;lave.</P>
<P>There were now two competitors for the crown: Robert, who was
engaged in the Holy war; and Henry, the younge&s;t brother, who remained at
home. The right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was evidently in favour of the fir&s;t, but
the latter was upon the &s;pot: nothing can be a more evident in&s;tance how
little hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was minded at that time, than that Henry's
title prevailed, and that he was elected by the joint acclamations of the
people. Whenever there is a di&s;puted throne, the people generally regain
their liberty: Henry, knowing the weakne&s;s of his preten&s;ions to the crown,
was re&s;olved to &s;trengthen his power, by gaining the affections of his
people. He, therefore, once more confirmed the ancient Saxon laws, and
in|dulged the clergy in all their former privileges.</P>
<P>Upon Robert's return from the Holy Land. where he refu&s;ed to be
crowned King of Jeru&s;a|lem, he found him&s;elf deprived, in his ab&s;ence, 
<PB N="72" REF="75"> a kingdom which he con&s;idered as his birth-right. His
attempts, however, to recover it were without &s;ucce&s;s. This Prince &s;eemed
only born to be the &s;port of fortune: his bravery, his genero&s;ity, and a
thou&s;and other good qualities, of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;erved to
render him the dupe of every deceiver, and the in&s;trument of impo&s;ing
villainy. At one time, we behold him pro&s;ecuting his pre|ten&s;ions with
&s;pirit; at another, giving up his ju&s;t claims with vicious genero&s;ity.
Thus, after a life &s;pent in toil, fatigue, and ambition, he found him&s;elf,
at la&s;t, utterly deprived, not only of his patrimonial dukedom, but of his
fortune, his free|dom, and friends. Normandy he &s;aw fall to the conqueror: to
add to his misfortunes, he at la&s;t langui&s;hed, for twenty-&s;ix years of
his life, a pri|&s;oner in Cardiff ca&s;tle in Wales, where he died in
captivity. To want prudence is, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to want virtue.</P>
<P>Henry, having acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy, might now be
&s;aid to be ma&s;ter of a theatre where many a &s;ucceeding tragedy was to be
performed; and &s;oon his neighbour of France began to &s;hew his jealou&s;y of
&s;o powerful a rival. The&s;e wars now began which were to be &s;o fatal to
di&s;tant po&s;terity. The ravages of the French were at fir&s;t neglected, and
Henry remained a quiet &s;pec|tator in England, as if unprovoked at their
in&s;o|lence: but foon he &s;hewed, that his unwillingne&s;s to engage was by
no means the effect of fear. He pa&s;&s;ed into Normandy with a powerful army,
and offered the enemy battle: the challenge was &s;oon accepted, and a furious
combat en&s;ued. During the fight, a French cavalier, named Cri&s;pin,
per|&s;onally attacked the King of England, and &s;truck him twice on the head,
with &s;uch force, that all <PB N="73" REF="76"> his armour &s;treamed with an
effu&s;ion from the wound. The King, however, no way intimidated, continued the
&s;ingle combat with re&s;olution, and, &s;ummoning all his &s;trength,
di&s;charged &s;uch a blow at his adver&s;ary, as threw him from his hor&s;e,
and he became the pri&s;oner of his Maje&s;ty's own hand. This decided the
victory in favour of the Engli&s;h, who pur&s;ued the French with great
&s;laughter, which ha&s;tened the peace, that was concluded &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Fortune now &s;eemed to &s;mile upon Henry, and promi&s;e a long
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of felicity: he was in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two
powerful &s;tates, and had a Prince for undi&s;puted heir, now arrived at his
&s;ixteenth year of age, a youth of great hopes. All his enemies were humbled,
and many actually in his own power. Matilda, his daughter, was married to the
Emperor Henry IV, and he had the hearts of the greate&s;t number of his
&s;ubjects, par|ticularly the Engli&s;h. All his pro&s;pects, however, were at
once clouded by an unfore&s;een misfortune, an accident which tinctured his
remaining life with mi&s;ery. Henry, returning victorious from abroad, brought
with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility. In one of the ve&s;&s;els of
the fleet, his &s;on, and &s;everal young noblemen, his companions, went
together to render the pa&s;&s;age more agreeable. The young Prince, de&s;irous
to be fir&s;t a&s;hore, promi&s;ed the &s;eamen a reward, if they came in
foremo&s;t. This emulation was fatal to them all; the pilot ran the &s;hip upon
a rock, and immediately &s;he was da&s;hed to pieces. The Prince, however, was
put into the boat and would have e&s;caped, were he not called back by the
cries of Matilda, his &s;i&s;ter. He was now out of dan|ger him&s;elf, but
could not leave her to peri&s;h: he <PB N="74" REF="77"> prevailed upon the
&s;ailors to row back to take her in: the approach of the boat giving others an
op|portunity to attempt &s;aving their lives, &s;everal leap|ed in al&s;o, &s;o
that the boat was overloaded, and all, except one, went to the bottom. When
Henry was informed of the cata&s;trophe of his only &s;on, he covered his face,
and never laughed after.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his life &s;eems a mere blank, his re&s;t|le&s;s
&s;pirit of ambition had nothing now to toil for. His daughter, Matilda,
however, becoming a widow, he married her a &s;econd time to Geoffry of
Plantagenet, and, when brought to-bed of a &s;on, named Henry, he cau&s;ed the
nobility to give an oath of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in her favour. The great men of
tho&s;e times were ready to &s;wear whatever the Monarch commanded, but
ob&s;erved it no longer than while they were obliged to obey. He did not long
&s;urvive this attempt to confirm the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; he died, as it is
&s;aid, of a &s;urfeit, cau&s;ed by eating lampreys, in the &s;ixty-eighth year
of his age, having reigned thirty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange, that hi&s;torians impute it as a fault to &s;everal
Engli&s;h Monarchs of tho&s;e times, that they came to the crown without
hereditary claims to &s;upport their title: this is one of the faults al|ledged
again&s;t Henry, but it is none, if we con&s;ider the u&s;ual &s;pirit of other
&s;ucce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>During the reign of Henry, the barons and the clergy were growing
into power: each was a pet|ty tyrant over tho&s;e who held under him. In order,
therefore, to confirm privileges &s;o lately acquired, they joined in electing
a King, who might owe to them, and not to any previous claim, his prerogative
and &s;ceptre. With &s;uch in|tentions they pitched upon Stephen, nephew to the
decea&s;ed King; and, as for their oaths to Ma|tilda, <PB N="75" REF="78"> the
Bi&s;hops gave them an ab&s;olution. They could not, indeed, have made a
properer choice than him whom they elected; but their conduct proceeded only
from a concern for them&s;elves, and not for the people. Stephen was ready
enough to con&s;ent to all their exorbitant demands; he acknowledged the crown
as their gift, not his ju&s;t inheritance; and confirmed all the immuni|ties,
privileges, and claims of the clergy.</P>
<P>The kingdom now began to wear the face of an ari&s;tocracy, in which
the barons and clergy might be &s;aid to command. They built ca&s;tles,
fortified and garri&s;oned them with their own troops, from whence, when
offended, they would bid their Monarch defiance. Of all mi&s;eries that ever
af|fected kingdoms, an uncontrouled power among the great is certainly the
mo&s;t afflictive. The tyranny of a &s;ingle Monarch only falls upon the narrow
circle around him; the arbitrary will of a number of delegates falls mo&s;t
heavily upon the lower ranks of people, who have no redre&s;s. In &s;hort, the
barons clamoured for their own privi|leges, the clergy for their own liberty,
but the people were &s;laves.</P>
<P>Stephen was &s;en&s;ible of this, and, in order to dimini&s;h their
power, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, by force, of &s;ome of their ca&s;tles,
which were incompatible with the &s;afety of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus we may di&s;cern three different contending powers at this
time: the King and his followers, the barons and their adherents, and the
clergy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the generality of the people: to the&s;e was &s;oon
added a fourth, Matilda, who claimed the crown in pur&s;uance of Henry's
command. This haughty woman, who had been wife to an Em|peror, and &s;till
&s;eemed to retain a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <PB N="76" REF="79"> her dignity,
landed from Normandy, accompanied only by a few followers, and openly laid
claim to the crown. Mean time, Stephen, being inform|ed of her arrival, flew to
be&s;iege Arundel, a ca&s;tle belonging to the Queen Dowager, where Matilda had
taken up her re&s;idence. This fortre&s;s did not &s;eem to promi&s;e a long
defence, and would have been &s;oon taken, had it not been repre&s;ented to
him, that, as this was a ca&s;tle belonging to the Queen Dowager, it would be
an infringement of the re&s;pect due to her to attempt taking it by force.
There was a &s;pirit of genero&s;ity prevalent in the times I treat of, which
was unknown to their degenerate po&s;terity. Stephen permitted Ma|tilda to come
out, and conveyed her, in &s;afety, to Bri&s;tol, another fortre&s;s equally
&s;trong with that from whence he permitted her to retire.</P>
<P>It is a deplorable con&s;ideration, that our virtues, often
in&s;tead of being attended with happy con&s;e|quences here, are found fatal to
&s;uch as adhere to them without deviation. Matilda, owing her free|dom merely
to the genero&s;ity of the King, made no other u&s;e of it but to levy an army
again&s;t him, and this army, at length, proved victorious. During the
continuance of this civil war, the whole king|dom was divided; pillage and
de&s;olation were the con&s;equence, whoever happened to be conqueror.</P>
<P>It was at length, however, determined, by a deci&s;ive victory
obtained over the King. The troops he led, were, in general, foreign
merce|naries, and commanded by tumultous barons, more accu&s;tomed to command
than to conquer. His hor&s;e gave way, and his infantry, being de&s;titute of
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;oon followed their example, and de&s;erted their
King. All the race of the Norman conqueror were brave: Stephen, unknow|ing 
<PB N="77" REF="80"> how to fly, was left alone, and fought on foot in the
mid&s;t of the field of battle, a&s;&s;aulted by multitudes, and re&s;i&s;ting
all their efforts with a&s;to|ni&s;hing valour. Had his hor&s;e then railied,
he might have come off victorious. He was now hemmed in on every &s;ide, but,
with his battle-ax, made way for &s;ome time: that breaking, he then drew out
his &s;word, and dealt his blows round the circle in which he was inclo&s;ed.
At length, after performing more than could naturally be expected from a
&s;ingle arm, his &s;word flying in pieces, he was obliged to &s;urrender
him&s;elf a pri&s;oner. In this manner he was conducted, by the conqueror, from
the field, and ignominiou&s;ly laid in irons.</P>
<P>Matilda now was proclaimed Queen, and, for &s;ome time, her power
was acknowledged by the generality of the nation. But, as &s;he di&s;dained to
accept the &s;hadow of royalty, which was all the barons and clergy intended to
grant, &s;he di&s;gu&s;ted them by her pride, and &s;oon made tho&s;e repent
who had rai&s;ed her from their levity. The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter &s;eems,
at this time, to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of unbounded power. He had been
chief|ly in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing her to the throne; he now, therefore,
levied an army, to convince her, that it was no le&s;s in his power to deprive
her of a kingdom, than to put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He was
&s;ucce&s;sful in his de&s;igns: Matilda was obliged to quit England once more,
and Stephen was taken from chains, and once more placed upon the throne.</P>
<P>Again put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this unea&s;y &s;eat, he &s;eemed
only exalted to give new in&s;tances of his refu&s;ing the exorbitant demands
of the barons and the clergy. He endeavoured to get the crown to devolve upon
his &s;on, but this was not complied <PB N="78" REF="81"> with by the
Bi&s;hops. It is &s;aid, though it has &s;carcely the appearance of truth, that
he confined them in one hou&s;e, and there threatened to detain them till they
complied with his will. This was an extraordinary method of obtaining their
con|&s;ent, and &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual wi&s;dom: his
precautions, accordingly, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the Archbi&s;hop found
means to e&s;cape his guards, and fly into Normandy, in order to bring over a
new King, and to rai&s;e a new in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this Bi&s;hops intrigues, Henry, &s;on to the
Empre&s;s Matilda, and who had been long acknowledged for Duke of Normandy,
&s;oon landed with a formidable army. The barons, ever re&s;tle&s;s and
regardle&s;s of their obligations, were again divided upon this occa&s;ion, and
a terrible civil war threatened the kingdom afre&s;h, when, happily for the
people, a truce was propo&s;ed be|tween the oppo&s;ite powers: this paved the
way to a more la&s;ting peace. It was agreed, that Stephen &s;hould enjoy the
crown of England during his life, and that Henry &s;hould be acknowledged as
his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In this manner a civil war was termi|nated, which had, for
&s;ome years, laid England in blood. The nation once more began to re&s;pire

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have hitherto &s;een the barons and clergy becoming powerful in
proportion to the weakne&s;s of the Monarch's title to the crown, and enriching
them&s;elves with the &s;poils of depre&s;&s;ed Maje&s;ty. <HI>Henry
Plantagenet</HI> had now every right, both from hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and univer&s;al a&s;|&s;ent, that could fix a Monarch on his throne:
con&s;cious, therefore, of his &s;trength, he began to re&s;ume tho&s;e
privileges which had been extorted from his predece&s;&s;or's weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t commenced by demoli&s;hing tho&s;e ca&s;tles which the
barons and clergy built, and which only &s;erved as &s;anctuaries to guilt,
trea&s;on, and debauchery: he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the foreign troops which had been
mercenaries to his predece&s;&s;or; and, per|ceiving the poverty of the crown,
re&s;umed all tho&s;e lands which properly belonged to it; and enacted &s;ome
laws, by which the people, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, became independent of their
barons, by whom they were claimed as appurtenances to their e&s;tates and
manors.</P>
<P>He gave charters to &s;everal towns, by which the citizens claimed
their freedom and privileges, independent of any &s;uperior but him&s;elf.
The&s;e charters may properly be called the ground-work of Engli&s;h liberty:
the &s;truggles heretofore were, whether a monarchy, or an ari&s;tocracy,
&s;hould prevail? whether the King, or the nobility only? But, by this grant,
the lowe&s;t orders of people began to have a ju&s;t value for them&s;elves,
and to claim the prerogatives of humanity. Thus was the foeudal government,
fir&s;t impaired; liberty began <PB N="80" REF="83"> to be diffu&s;ed more
equally upon every rank of people, and the Kings became capable of levying
armies independent of their va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>But, though he in &s;ome mea&s;ure dimini&s;hed the power of the
barons, by enlarging that of the people, yet &s;till there was a third power,
namely, the clergy, which daily grew &s;tronger, and united by one bond,
pur&s;uing the &s;ame de&s;ign, were mak|ing large &s;trides to independence.
He undertook to humble them al&s;o; he perceived the clergy were re&s;olved,
not only to be exempt from the u&s;ual taxes of the &s;tate, but even its
puni&s;hments. They had extorted an immunity from all but eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
cen&s;ures, in the preceding reign, and conti|nued to maintain that grant in
the pre&s;ent. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a law, which thus
&s;creened their guilt, &s;erved but to increa&s;e it: ac|cordingly, more than
an hundred murders, upon proof, were committed by the clergy, of which not one
was puni&s;hed, even with degradation. What is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing,
the Bi&s;hops gloried in their horrid indulgence. Among the number of murderers
who were pardoned, was a clergy|man of the dioce&s;e of Sarum: the complaint
was brought before the Archbi&s;hop's court, and the circum&s;tances of his
guilt appeared mo&s;t atrocious. However, the only puni&s;hment decreed was,
that the murderer &s;hould be deprived of his benefice, and confined to a
mona&s;tery. The King, &s;truck with horror at &s;uch inju&s;tice, reproached
the Arch|bi&s;hop, who, on the other hand, a&s;&s;erted, that an
eccle&s;ia&s;tic could not be puni&s;hed with death, and that the King had no
right to intermeddle in the affairs of the church. This Archbi&s;hop was the
noted Thomas a Becket, who had been advanced, by the King, to this high
&s;tation from the meane&s;t <PB N="81" REF="84"> ob&s;curity: he was a man of
&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, great pride, and great zeal, which had been, in the
early part of life, &s;mothered in deep di&s;&s;imulation and apparent
humility. He was, at this time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once of the
chancellor&s;hip, of the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, and was legate to the
Holy See. The&s;e were great tru&s;ts; but, what rendered him &s;till more
powerful, he either thought him&s;elf a &s;aint, or affected to be thought
&s;o; he wore &s;ackcloth next his &s;kin, and his equipage and diet were mean
and &s;imple. So much power, pride, and &s;eeming humility, united, were
formi|dable; and &s;uch Henry found them.</P>
<P>The King propo&s;ed, in a council of the nobles, that the Bi&s;hops
&s;hould not be permitted to go to Rome; that no &s;ubject &s;hould appeal to
the Holy See; that no officer of the crown &s;hould be ex-communicated, or
&s;u&s;pended, without the Sove|reign's permi&s;&s;ion; and la&s;tly (which was
the great article he aimed at) that the clergy &s;hould be &s;ub|ject to the
temporal judges, as well as the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects. Such ju&s;t
propo&s;itions were agreed upon by all pre&s;ent, even Becket he&s;itated not
to &s;ign his name: they were referred next to the Pope, for his approbation;
the Pope di&s;approved of them all. Upon this, therefore, Becket declared his
repentance, for having complied with the King in &s;igning the Con&s;titutions
of Clarendon, as they were called; and, in order to carry on the farce,
&s;u&s;pended him&s;elf, as unworthy to perform his functions till the Pope
&s;hould be plea&s;ed to ab|&s;olve him.</P>
<P>This pardon he quickly obtained, and now he &s;et no bounds to his
ob&s;tinacy and ambition. Some hi&s;torians de&s;cribe Becket as a &s;aint, and
&s;ome as a de&s;igning hypocrite; neither are, probably, ju&s;t 
<PB N="82" REF="85"> in their opinions. He pur&s;ued, with inflexibility, what
was in fact wrong, but what education, and the manners of the times, had taught
him to be|lieve was right: his errors were rather of judgment than of will; the
world abounds with men who are erroneous, there are but few villains.</P>
<P>The King was re&s;olved to humble a man him|&s;elf, who had, by his
own authority, been lifted into power, and accu&s;ed him of embezzling the
public money, while Chancellor. While the judges were con&s;ulting, Becket
in&s;olently entered the council, with a cro&s;ier in his hand, to intimidate
his judges: but, notwith&s;tanding this boldne&s;s, he was condemned as a
traitor, although he found means of avoiding puni&s;hment, by e&s;caping into
Flanders.</P>
<P>The Popes had long been growing formidable to the Kings of England.
Alexander III. imme|diately e&s;pou&s;ed Becket's quarrel, and brought the King
to con&s;ent to a conference, which came to nothing; another &s;ucceeded, but
with as little &s;ucce&s;s; a third was propo&s;ed, and accepted. The King,
wearied out with the repeated threats of the Pope, and the excommunications of
his clergy, con&s;ented to almo&s;t every thing the haughty pre|late demanded.
But when all the articles were &s;ettled, and Becket was to give the King the
ki&s;s of peace, he took it into his head to &s;ay, that it was for God's
honour: the King in&s;i&s;ted that this expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be retracted;
Becket in&s;i&s;ted upon u&s;ing it: this renewed the debate, and the
conference ended once more without effect.</P>
<P>At length, however, after an interval of &s;ome years, they were
reconciled, and the Archbi&s;hop made his entry into London, amid&s;t the
acclama|tions of the populace. His pride was now in|crea&s;ed 
<PB N="83" REF="86"> by &s;ucce&s;s, and he went from town to town in a &s;ort
of triumphal cavalcade. But he was &s;carce|ly re-in&s;tated in his power, when
he began to exert it to its utmo&s;t extent: he &s;olemnly excom|municated two
lords who had oppo&s;ed him, and publi&s;hed the Pope's letters, for the
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;everal bi&s;hops who had &s;hewn them&s;elves his
ene|mies. The King, who was in Normandy, &s;oon received information of this
prelate's pride and po|pularity, and &s;oon after the &s;u&s;pended Bi&s;hops
came over to lay before him their complaints: throwing them&s;elves at his
feet, they implored his protection, and inveighed again&s;t their
oppre&s;&s;or. Henry was now quite exa&s;perated by their com|plaints, and
continually unea&s;y from the repeated in&s;tances of Becket's in&s;olence, was
heard to &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Is there none to revenge their Monarch's cau&s;e
upon this audacious prie&s;t?</HI></Q> The&s;e words &s;eemed to arm the mo&s;t
re&s;olute of his attendants, and four knights, who&s;e names were Hugh Norvil,
William Tracy, Hugh Brito, and Richard Fitzur&s;e, ha&s;tened to Canterbury,
and, entering the cathedral, where Becket was officiating, with a few
attendants, they beat out his brains, with clubs, at the foot of the altar.</P>
<P>His death confirmed tho&s;e privileges to the clergy, which his
oppo&s;ition could not do. His re&s;olution, during life, and his
re&s;ignation, when dying, gained the hearts of the people. He was looked upon
as a martyr, and the clergy took care to confirm his &s;anctity by miracles.
When the people are re&s;olved to &s;ee miracles, they are &s;eldom
di&s;appointed: it was not &s;ufficient that his &s;hrine had a power of
re&s;toring dead men to life, it re|&s;tored al&s;o cows, dogs, and hor&s;es.
It was re|ported, and believed, that he ro&s;e from his coffin 
<PB N="84" REF="87"> before he was buried, to light the tapers de&s;igned for
his funeral; and, when the funeral ceremony was over, that he &s;tretched forth
his hand to ble&s;s the people. Thus Becket became a &s;aint, and Henry was
&s;u&s;pected of being the author of his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>In order to divert the attention of the public from &s;u&s;picions
of this nature, Henry undertook the conque&s;t of Ireland; a project formed
&s;ome years before, but deferred on account of his long protracted quarrel.
The more readily to gain the Pope's approbation of his undertaking, (for
no|thing could then be atchieved without the &s;anction of Rome) he cleared
him&s;elf, by oath, of being any way privy to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and
made a &s;olemn vow to go barefoot to Becket's tomb, there to receive the
di&s;cipline of the church.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed with Pope Adrian's bull, which granted him a
kingdom that was not his to give, he &s;ubdued Ireland with a rapidity equal to
his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes: but it was no hard matter to conquer a country
which was at that time barba|rous, and divided under different chiefs, and each
pur&s;uing different views and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But the happine&s;s this Monarch received from this acce&s;&s;ion of
power, was &s;oon allayed by a con|&s;piracy in his own family. Among the few
vices of this Monarch, unlimited gallantry was one. His Queen was
di&s;agreeable, and he was faithle&s;s: but, though an admirer of all the
&s;ex, he &s;ingled out, with particular affection, Ro&s;amond Clifford, a lady
of matchle&s;s beauty. Hi&s;torians and poets talk of the fair Ro&s;amond in
the warme&s;t &s;trains of rapture; if what they &s;ay be true, never did
Eng|land produce &s;o much beauty united with &s;o much grace before. He kept
her concealed in a laby|rinth <PB N="85" REF="88"> at Wood&s;tock park, and, in
her company, pa&s;&s;ed his hours of vacancy and plea&s;ure. But the Queen at
length came to a knowledge of this amour, and, pur&s;uing her happy rival to
her re|treat, guided, &s;ay &s;ome, by a clew of &s;ilk, &s;he obliged her to
take poi&s;on.</P>
<P>As this was an offence which the Queen could not be forgiven, &s;he
was re&s;olved not to forgive. Her &s;ons were &s;oon brought to &s;hare her
re&s;ent|ments, and a con&s;piracy was formed, abetted by all the malecontents
of the kingdom. To this unnatural combination Henry oppo&s;ed his u&s;ual
prudence and re&s;olution: he &s;eemed on every &s;ide a&s;&s;aulted, but
every-where came off victorious. A&s;cribing, however, the oppo&s;ition of his
own children to the indignation of offended Heaven, he was re&s;olved, by an
exemplary penance, to conciliate its favour.</P>
<P>Now was the time in which the clergy were to come off victorious;
this was the &s;ea&s;on in which they were to reap the labours of their
martyred defender; and by one weak action the King was now to cancel what a
great part of his life he had been employed in bringing to ripene&s;s. Being
come within &s;ight of Canterbury, he walked barefoot to Becket's tomb, in
extreme pain; there he was &s;courged by the Monks, and &s;pent the whole night
upon the pavement. The Monks were thus re|in&s;tated again in all their claims,
and the people involved in greater &s;uper&s;tition than before.</P>
<P>This penance, however, no way &s;erved to re|concile him to his
family; he even cur&s;ed their ingratitude, and, wearied with dome&s;tic
conten|tion, re&s;olved, at la&s;t, to undertake a cru&s;ade: his &s;on
Richard, however, &s;till pur&s;uing the dic|tates of ambition rather than of
nature, deprived <PB N="86" REF="89"> him of all power to put this de&s;ign
into exe|cution. Pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;appointment, therefore, began to make
vi&s;ible depredations on his con&s;ti|tution, and mark him for the grave: he
fell &s;ick at Chinon in Normandy, and, finding his end approach, he cau&s;ed
him&s;elf to be carried into the church, before the altar, where he expired,
with &s;carce a &s;ingle attendant to deplore his fall.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I compare the Engli&s;h, at this pe|riod, with the neighbouring
nations, I can't avoid remarking in them a peculiar degree of cou|rage,
genero&s;ity, and politene&s;s. They had, during the Saxon Kings, &s;unk into
bigotry and effemina|cy; but a mixture of the Norman fiercene&s;s im|proved
their characters, and rendered them at once valiant yet forgiving.</P>
<P>You have &s;een Henry, as well as all his Nor|man predece&s;&s;ors,
improve tho&s;e good qualities in his &s;ubjects, not le&s;s by influence than
exam|ple. You have &s;een him attempting to increa&s;e the freedom of the
people by corporation charters, and to dimini&s;h the power of the barons by
weak|ning the foeudal government, by which the pea&s;ants and hu&s;bandmen were
&s;laves. In the&s;e de&s;igns he &s;ucceeded, but he failed in his endeavours
of le&s;|&s;ening the power of the clergy. The kingdom at his decea&s;e,
therefore, a&s;&s;umed a different ap|pearance from what it wore before his
acce&s;&s;ion. The people now began to have &s;ome, though but 
<PB N="87" REF="90"> a &s;mall &s;hare of, power: the barons had &s;till va&s;t
authority, though le&s;s than formerly; while the clergy might be con&s;idered
as a body entirely di&s;|tinct from the re&s;t of the community, governed by
their own laws, and profe&s;&s;ing &s;ubjection only to the Pope.</P>
<P>In this fituation were affairs, when Richard, the &s;on of Henry,
came, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to the govern|ment, in which his reign made no
material altera|tion. The prie&s;ts being the mo&s;t powerful body of men, it
is not &s;urprizing to find the King &s;e|conding their &s;chemes, which
perhaps he found it impo&s;&s;ible to oppo&s;e. Religion was then the pretext
for every &s;ini&s;ter action, obedience to the church the only rule of merit,
and, to oppo&s;e the ene|mies of Chri&s;tianity, preached up as an antidote for
every former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The kingdom of Pale&s;tine had been, for
&s;ome time, the theatre of war, and had drained Europe of its mo&s;t cho&s;en
troops, which fell like leaves in autumn, either by pe&s;tilence, famine, or
the &s;word. In this quar|rel the clergy found means to embark the King, by
awakening his ambition, and &s;trengthening his natural &s;uper&s;titions. A
romantic de&s;ire for &s;trange adventures, and an immoderate zeal for the
exter|nal parts of Chri&s;tianity, were the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the times,
and they ea&s;ily became the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of Richard.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with a de&s;ire of re&s;cuing the Holy Land from the
Infidels, he left England; and with a numerous army pa&s;&s;ed through France,
took Cy|prus from a Chri&s;tian Prince, landed in Pale&s;tine, overcame
Saladine, with a &s;laughter of forty thou|&s;and Saracens; took &s;everal
cities from the Infi|dels, and gained much reputation for conduct and
per&s;onal bravery, yet, after all, acquired no real <PB N="88" REF="91">
advantages for him&s;elf, or the cau&s;e in which he was engaged. Having
concluded a truce for three years with Saladine, he &s;et fail for his return;
but, his &s;hips being di&s;per&s;ed by a tempe&s;t, he was obliged to land
upon the coa&s;ts of Italy, where, pur&s;uing his way homeward by land, he was
ar|re&s;ted by the Duke of Au&s;tria, and put into the power of the Emperor,
who cruelly and ungene|rou&s;ly detained him a pri&s;oner, upon the
&s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t trivial pretences.</P>
<P>In the mean time England had been left under the government of two
prelates, the Bi&s;hop of Durham, and Longchamp, Bi&s;hop of Ely. The clergy,
&s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and rulers of the kingdom, might have given what laws
they thought proper; but there is a fatality in the affairs of men, that, when
friends are de&s;titute of other enemies, they generally make foes of each
other. The governors, now without rivals in the temporal intere&s;t,
di&s;agreed among them&s;elves, and thus weakened the power of the clergy.
John, brother to Richard, who long had a&s;pired to the crown, fomented this
jea|lou&s;y among the clergy, and, putting him&s;elf at the head of the
temporal lords, increa&s;ed their authority by the addition of his own. He
heard of the impri&s;onment of his brother with &s;ecret &s;a|tisfaction, and
u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to continue his captivity.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ungenerous efforts,
continued faithful to their King: his bra|very and genero&s;ity had &s;ecured
the hearts of the people, and the cau&s;e he fought for engaged the affections
of the clergy. The mona&s;teries, there|fore, &s;trained their finances to
rai&s;e a &s;um to pro|cure his relea&s;e, and the churches gave up their
trea&s;ures upon promi&s;e of having them re&s;tored <PB N="89" REF="92"> upon
his return. By the&s;e efforts Richard at length procured his liberty: the
Emperor, either a&s;hamed of his own ba&s;ene&s;s, or fearing the re|&s;entment
of the German Princes, agreed upon his relea&s;e for a large ran&s;om, and
England once more &s;aw her brave Monarch return crowned with conque&s;t, after
numberle&s;s victories, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;urmounted dangers.</P>
<P>The genero&s;ity of this Prince was equal to his valour; he knew
that his brother John had, in his ab&s;ence, attempted to &s;upplant him in the
throne; he had an exact information of all his intrigues with the French, who
had long endeavoured to bla&s;t his laurels, and interrupt his conque&s;ts;
yet, upon this Prince's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he generou&s;ly for|gave him all: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I wi&s;h,</HI> cried he, taking his brother by
the hand, <HI>I wi&s;h I could as ea&s;ily forget your offences, as you will my
pardon.</HI></Q> This conde&s;cen&s;ion was not lo&s;t upon a man who&s;e
heart, though naturally bad, was not dead to all the &s;entiments of huma|nity.
From this time John &s;erved him with fide|lity, and did him noble &s;ervices
in his battles with the French, which followed &s;oon after.</P>
<P>While Richard was engaged upon the conti|nent in a French war, an
infurrection was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed at London, which, though but &s;lightly
mentioned by hi&s;torians, &s;hould be particularly marked by &s;uch as would
trace the con&s;titution. William Fitzo&s;born, commonly called Longbeard, is
repre&s;ented at once as a man brave and enter|pri&s;ing. He had long been an
advocate for the poor and meane&s;t of the people, and had gained the hearts of
the populace, who held him in ex|treme veneration. Upon inflicting a new tax,
the hurthen of which was to fall entirely on the poor, he rai&s;ed an
in&s;urrection of the people, which the <PB N="90" REF="93"> Archbi&s;hop was,
at fir&s;t, unable to appea&s;e. The principal citizens being called, upon this
occa&s;ion, to arms, Longbeard was at length hard pre&s;&s;ed, and obliged to
take refuge in one of the churches; but no &s;anctuary could &s;creen this
&s;elf-delegated champion; he was &s;eized, convicted, and, with nine of his
accomplices, hanged in chains. This was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the people's
&s;truggling for privileges, as a body di&s;tinct from the barons and clergy.
Longbeard may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t victim to that untameable
&s;pirit, which ever &s;ince has actuated this people in &s;upport of their
privileges, and prompted them to the rights of humanity.</P>
<P>Upon a review of the re&s;t of this reign, we find the Monarch
almo&s;t always in the field, or intent upon &s;chemes to &s;upply his warlike
expeditions; di&s;appointed of the fruits of conque&s;t, or groan|ing in
captivity. If, indeed, it were ju&s;t to a&s;cribe his misfortunes to his
incen&s;ed father's malediction, we might be apt to &s;u&s;pect it, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, as the cau&s;e. However, after a reign of ten years, thus pa&s;&s;ed
in turbulence and fruitle&s;s victory, he died of a wound received from an
arrow at the &s;iege of Chaluz. While he was yet alive, the &s;oldier, by
who&s;e hand he died, was brought before him: the King &s;ternly demanded the
rea&s;on why he &s;ought his life? 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My father and my brothers,</HI> replied the
undaunted &s;oldier, <HI>died by your hand, and Heaven has given me the
opportunity of a ju&s;t and glorious revenge.</HI></Q> The dying Monarch, no
way exa&s;perated by this reply, ob&s;erved, that the centinel had done his
duty, ordered him a pre&s;ent, and forgave him. But the Flemi&s;h General was
unacquainted with &s;uch genero&s;ity: in&s;tead of complying with the King's
command, he &s;eized the mi&s;erable wretch, <PB N="91" REF="94"> and, a&s;ter
Richard's death, commanded him, in his pre&s;ence, to be flead alive.</P>
<P>All the actions of this Prince were generous and brave. I know not
what plea&s;ure, Rapin, that &s;o frequently injudicious hi&s;torian, can take
in le&s;&s;ening the virtues of the race of Norman Monarchs. Among other faults
a&s;cribed to Ri|chard, he accu&s;es him of pride; yet it appears he bore the
admonitions of his inferiors with gentle|ne&s;s and good humour. The
ea&s;ine&s;s of his di&s;|po&s;ition, as well as the delicacy of his wit, are
apparent from the quickne&s;s of his replies. It is &s;aid, that being one day
admoni&s;hed, by an ob|&s;cure Monk, to part with his three daughters, by which
he meant his pride, his lu&s;t, and his avarice: he wittily made an&s;wer, that
he de&s;ired nothing more, and had already pitched upon proper hu&s;|bands for
their di&s;po&s;al; here&s;olved to give his pride to the Templars, his avarice
to the Monks, and, as for his lu&s;t, the Clergy &s;hould &s;hare that among
them. Such in&s;olent advice, from a churchman, at this day, would be attended
with a very different reply. I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE wars that were now kindled up between England and France,
continued to depopu|late both countries, without making, in the end, any
material alteration. John, the brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Richard,
pur&s;ued them with unabating vigour. We may regard the&s;e, and &s;uch-like
com|motions, among Chri&s;tian Princes, as pe&s;tilences, which lay whole
provinces wa&s;te, without making <PB N="92" REF="95"> any change in their
limits, their manners or go|vernment.</P>
<P>John, who was &s;irnamed Lackland, was, in fact, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive dominion of any Prince in Europe. Be&s;ides the lands
left him by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he had wre&s;ted Bretagne from Ar|thur, his
nephew, who&s;e right it was. However, John, by thus pretending to what was not
ju&s;tly his, in the end lo&s;t even what he had.</P>
<P>Having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bretagne, the unfortunate Arthur
al&s;o fell into his power. He cau&s;ed him to be confined in a tower, and what
became of him was never after explained to the public &s;atisfaction. John was
&s;u&s;pected, and not without rea&s;on, of the death of his nephew. He made
&s;ome efforts to wipe off the odious &s;tain, yet without effect: happily, for
the in&s;truction of fu|ture Princes, this crime only opened a way to his
future ruin; and, having begun his reign by be|ing the enemy of mankind in
pro&s;perity, the whole world, in the end, &s;eemed to turn their back upon him
in his di&s;tre&s;s. The power of the nobility of France was now exerted, with
ju&s;tice, again&s;t him: tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies of noblemen, each of which
was, at that time, the petty lawle&s;s tyrant of his dependants, in this
in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, undertook to puni&s;h the guilty. Con&s;tance, the
unfortunate mother of the murdered Prince, flew for protec|tion to the peers,
and implored redre&s;s. The King of England was &s;ummoned to appear; he
refu&s;ed, and the peers of France confi&s;cated all the lands and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were held under that crown. This confi&s;cation was
&s;oon attended with vigorous efforts to put it into execution; John, at once
both weak and cowardly, a tyrant when unoppo&s;ed, but timorous in danger,
&s;uffered him&s;elf tamely to <PB N="93" REF="96"> be &s;tripped of them all.
He &s;ucce&s;&s;ively lo&s;t Nor|mandy, Touraine, and Poictou, and then fled
back to England, to make him&s;elf hated and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Hitherto, however, he was only contemptible to his neighbour
Princes; he &s;till had &s;ome ex|pectations from the e&s;teem and affection of
his natural &s;ubjects, but he &s;oon &s;hewed, that all his &s;kill was only
in making enemies, but that he wanted abilities to reconcile them. The clergy
had, for &s;ome time, acted as a &s;eparate body, and had their elections of
each other generally con|firmed by the Pope: the election of Archbi&s;hops had,
for &s;ome time, been a continual &s;ubject of di&s;pute between the
&s;uffragan Bi&s;hops and the Augu&s;tine Monks, and both had precedents to
confirm their preten&s;ions: things being in this &s;ituation, the Archbi&s;hop
of Canterbury happened to die, and the Augu&s;tine Monks, in a private manner,
made choice of Reginald, their Sub|prior. The Bi&s;hops exclaimed at this as
invading their privileges, and here was likely to begin a theological
conte&s;t. A politic Prince would have managed the quarrel in &s;uch a manner,
as to let the body of the clergy thus grow weaker by divi&s;ion; but John was
not a politic Prince; he immediately &s;ided with the &s;uffragan Bi&s;hops,
and the Bi&s;hop of Norwich was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en. To decide the&s;e
differences, an appeal was made to the Pope. Innocent III, who then filled the
chair, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unbounded &s;hare of power, and his talents were
equal to the veneration he was held in: he vacated both claims, and enjoined
the Monks to chu&s;e Stephen Langton, an Engli&s;hman then at the court of
Rome. John knew how to oppo&s;e, though not to negociate; he received the
Pope's decree with a degree of ungoverned fury, and re|turned 
<PB N="94" REF="97"> the Pope a letter filled with abu&s;e. Inno|cent, in
return, put the whole kingdom of Eng|land under an interdict, and forbad the
King's &s;ub|jects longer to obey him. The&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical thun|ders
were, at that time, truly formidable, and the more &s;o, as the execution of
them was committed to Philip-Augu&s;tus, King of France, an ambitious and a
politic Prince. To him the Pope gave the kingdom of England, as a perpetual
inheritance, a&s;&s;uring him of a remi&s;&s;ion of all his &s;ins, if he
happened to &s;ucceed in conquering it. He grant|ed all who embarked in this
cau&s;e al&s;o the &s;ame indulgences as were u&s;ually given to &s;uch as went
upon a cru&s;ade. Philip immediately embraced the offer; not content with
depriving John of his con|tinental dominions, he devoured, in imagination, the
kingdom of England al&s;o. By his preparations it was evident how de&s;irous he
was to &s;ucceed in this undertaking; the &s;hips, of which his fleet was to
con&s;i&s;t, came together to the mouth of the Seine, whil&s;t the Princes, his
va&s;&s;als, collected their forces to the &s;hore from all parts of the
coun|try. His army was numerous, and the di&s;contents of the Engli&s;h were
equivalent to thou&s;ands more. Philip was ready, therefore, to &s;et &s;ail,
and John, on his part, made an expiring effort to receive him. All-hated as he
was, the natural enmity between the French and the Engli&s;h, the name of a
King, and &s;ome remaining &s;hare of power, put him at the head of an army of
&s;ixty thou&s;and men, with which he advanced to Dover.</P>
<P>Europe regarded &s;uch important preparations with impatience, and
the deci&s;ive blow was &s;oon expected. The Pope was too refined a politician
for both, and took upon him&s;elf what he pretend|ed to have de&s;igned for
Philip. This &s;ingular ne|gotiation <PB N="95" REF="98"> was executed by
Pandulph, as the Pope's legate to France and England. He pa&s;&s;ed through
France, where he beheld Philip's great armament, and highly commended his zeal
and diligence: from thence he went over to Dover, under pre|tence of
negotiating with the Barons, in favour of the French King, and had a conference
with John upon his arrival. He there repre&s;ented the number of the enemy, the
hatred of many of his own &s;ubjects; he intimated, that there was but one way
to &s;ecure him&s;elf from impending danger, which was, to put him&s;elf under
the Pope's pro|tection, who, as a kind and merciful father, was &s;till willing
to receive him to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>John was too much intimidated by the apparent danger, not to embrace
every means of offered &s;afety. He con&s;ented to the legate's
remon&s;trances, and took an oath to perform what the Pope &s;hould impo&s;e.
Having thus &s;worn to perform he knew not what, the artful Italian &s;o well
managed the Barons, and intimidated the King, that he took the following
extraordinary oath, before all the people, kneeling upon his knees, and putting
his hands between tho&s;e of the Legate:</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"I John, by the grace of God, King of Eng|land and
Lord of Ireland, in order to expiate my &s;ins, from my own free will, and the
ad|vice of my Barons, give to the church of Rome, to Pope Innocent, and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the king|dom of England, and all other prerogatives of my
crown: I will hereafter hold them as the Pope's va&s;&s;al. I will be faithful
to God, to the church of Rome, and to the Pope my ma&s;|ter, and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors legitimately elected. I promi&s;e to pay him a tribute of a
thou&s;and marks yearly, to wit, &s;even hundred for the <PB N="96" REF="99">
kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland."</Q></P>
<P>By this mean conce&s;&s;ion John &s;ecured his crown from a foreign
inva&s;ion, but became effec|tually contemptible in the eyes of his people:
&s;till, however, he was not hated by his &s;ubjects, their hatred only was
wanting to &s;ink him into complete wretchedne&s;s. After being expo&s;ed to
&s;o many di&s;graceful humiliations, he now thought, at the expence of his
honour, to &s;pend the remain|ing years of his life in tranquillity. But, in
pro|portion as he lo&s;t the e&s;teem of the Engli&s;h, he lo&s;t their
affections al&s;o. The former Monarchs &s;upported their power by a nice
oppo&s;ition of the clergy and the barons; when they intended to humble the
nobility, they granted new privileges to the church; when they de&s;ired to
le&s;&s;en the power of the clergy, they gave greater force to the temporal
intere&s;ts. John was ignorant of the manner of conducting this oppo&s;ition:
he had of|fended the clergy, and increa&s;ed their power, with|out making them
his friends; he had it only left now to offend his barons, to render him&s;elf
ob|noxious to every order of people. His former pu|&s;illanimity &s;oon gave
this powerful body hopes of expecting a renewal of tho&s;e powers, of which
they had been deprived in the preceding reign. They demanded, therefore, the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their ancient privileges, and John believed him&s;elf
authori&s;ed to refu&s;e them. This created new di&s;&s;en&s;ions: the King,
with a &s;trange per|ver&s;ene&s;s, in turn demanded their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for
the recovery of his lo&s;t dominions on the continent, and they refu&s;ed to
follow him. Their refu&s;al was &s;oon followed by more open acts of
ho&s;tility; they formed a confederacy, and, at an appointed 
<PB N="97" REF="100"> meeting, forced the King to grant all their de|mands, and
&s;ign that charter by which the Engli&s;h are &s;aid to hold their liberties
at this day.</P>
<P>The barons and the clergy by this &s;eemed the only governors of the
kingdom: the commonalty had no &s;hare in the legi&s;lature, they were
pa&s;&s;ed away, with the lands on which they were born, by their haughty
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: they were reckoned only as the &s;heep, oxen, and other
moveable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, which were upon the e&s;tate. The guar|dian of
an heir was to pre&s;erve the lands entire, and, to u&s;e the words of the
Magna Charta, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>&s;ine de&s;tructione et va&s;to hominum vel
rerum,</HI></Q> without de|&s;truction or wa&s;te of the men or the things upon
it. The King, the Barons, and the clergy, were all, in reality, enemies to
public liberty. Their party were &s;o many factions in the nation,
&s;ubver|&s;ive of the rights of mankind: how they, in turn, helped to
e&s;tabli&s;h liberty, you &s;hall &s;ee in my fu|ture corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>This charter was, in fact, giving the barons a definitive judgment
upon what&s;oever they thought proper to repre&s;ent as a grievance: they were
to prefer their complaints to the King, and he was, in forty days, to give them
&s;atisfaction, or they were legally impowered to command it. This was an
infringement of the prerogative, which he complied with through fear, and, as
&s;oon as he was at liberty, he retracted all he had agreed to: he loudly
complained of the force with which it had been exacted, and he demanded
ju&s;tice from the Pope, his new ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Pope, who had lately excommunicated the King, now excommunicated
the barons: the ba|rons, exa&s;perated, did exactly what the Pope had formerly
done upon a like occa&s;ion; they offered <PB N="98" REF="101"> the crown of
England to France. Philip, ever ready to profit by the&s;e commotions, accepted
their offer with joy, but, fearing the Pope's di&s;plea&s;ure if he a&s;&s;umed
a title to what was now con&s;idered as a patrimony of the Holy See, prevailed
upon the barons to elect his &s;on Lewis. To this league of the barons with
France the city of London lent its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We &s;hould be careful to
ob|&s;erve every beginning of power among the com|mons of England, and this
&s;eems to be one of the mo&s;t obvious in&s;tances. This noble city was the
fir&s;t that freed it&s;elf from foeudal government, and ventured to follow
leaders of its own appointment: in &s;hort it may, at this period, be looked
upon as a little republic, fighting between the powers of ari&s;tocracy,
repre&s;ented in the barons, and of de|&s;poti&s;m, a&s;&s;umed by the
King.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the army of Lewis, which was called over to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the barons, committed &s;trange di&s;orders; while, on the
other hand, that of John, which, like the former, was mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of
foreigners, was &s;till more in&s;o|lent and audacious. Never was England in a
more deplorable condition; &s;he had two armies of hun|gry foreigners in her
bowels, ravaging the country in a mercile&s;s manner, and threatening ruin
which|&s;oever proved victorious. John was, at length, de|po&s;ed by his
barons, and Lewis &s;olemnly crowned at London. The new Monarch then fir&s;t
thought of having the Pope's &s;anction to his claim. The Pope debated in
council the ju&s;tice of a cau&s;e, which &s;carcely de&s;erved a moment's
he&s;itation; while John led his harra&s;&s;ed army from city to ci|ty,
di&s;tru&s;ting even his mo&s;t faithful adherents. Pity then procured friends
which pro&s;perity could not procure: and now the barons were &s;truck with 
<PB N="99" REF="102"> &s;ome remor&s;e to &s;ee their native country, by their
procurement, thus laid de&s;olate, and their King a wanderer; but what added to
their afflictions was, that their &s;ervices were hitherto &s;lightly re|paid
by the new-crowned Monarch, and, from a knowledge of his di&s;po&s;ition, they
could hope for no increa&s;e of future favours. It was even re|ported among
them, that his intentions were to bani&s;h them for their di&s;loyalty to their
former &s;o|vereign, though exerted in his own favour. What|ever their motives
might be, forty barons addre&s;&s;ed letters of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;uit to King
John; the Pope al&s;o held the ju&s;tice of his claim in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; a
gleam of di&s;tant pro&s;perity &s;eemed to brighten his affairs: but, while
the conjuncture &s;eemed big with new events, the death of both the Pope, and
of John, decided the conte&s;t. This Monarch died in the fifty-fir&s;t year of
his age, after a reign of more than &s;eventeen years, &s;pent in wars without
&s;ucce&s;s, and exertions of power without increa&s;e of authority. I am,</P>

<P>HAD Lewis, who was crowned King, di&s;&s;em|bled till
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncontrouled power, he might have retained the crown. But
the ba|rons wanted a Monarch &s;ub&s;ervient to their power, and Lewis
refu&s;ed a kingdom upon &s;uch condi|tions. They now, therefore, turned from
the French intruder to the young Monarch, from whom they expected greater
conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103"> Henry III, appointed &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the
crown by John his father, was but ten years of age when made King, and the Earl
of Pembroke was, by mutual con&s;ent, con&s;tituted his guardian. The
incon&s;tancy of the Engli&s;h was now more than ever apparent: Lewis was, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, for|&s;aken by his new &s;ubjects, and, after a defeat,
obliged to relinqui&s;h all preten&s;ions to the king|dom. What the barons,
however, had hoped from the King's tender age, did not an&s;wer their
expectations. The Earl of Pembroke, who go|verned his nonage, made a powerful
intere&s;t with the clergy, and, by their means, &s;erved to balance the
&s;tate.</P>
<P>While Henry acted under the direction of others, the power of the
barons &s;eemed to have been kept under; he had the clergy for him, and
con&s;equent|ly the people, and the&s;e two were equivalent to all the
nobility. But, as &s;oon as Henry came to take the reins into his own hands,
numberle&s;s in|&s;urrections and calamities were the re&s;ult of his
ob&s;tinacy, folly, and vice. Infinite were the &s;truggles for power between
the barons and the King. Henry's luxury and profu&s;ene&s;s continu|ally
rendered him a petitioner to the a&s;&s;embly of barons for money (for now the
Kings began to a&s;k money in&s;tead of men) and they as con&s;tant|ly demanded
a confirmation of tho&s;e privileges which had been granted them under the
reign of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In order to render him&s;elf independent of them, he found a
thou&s;and ridiculous pretences for rai&s;ing money without their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He would invite him&s;elf to the hou&s;es of his &s;ubjects,
and always expected a pre&s;ent at the door: he extorted from the Jews,
wherever he found them, without any <PB N="101" REF="104"> remor&s;e. He even
&s;crupled not to defraud minors of their lawful inheritances, to which he had
been left protector; while the people had the mortification to &s;ee tho&s;e
&s;ums lavi&s;hed upon un|de&s;erving favourites, foreigners without merit,
&s;trumpets, flatterers, and all the vermin of a vi|cious court.</P>
<P>But all his exactions were not &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply his
prodigality; he &s;till wanted money, he &s;till was obliged to have recour&s;e
to his barons, and yet he &s;till de&s;ired to be ab&s;olute. The barons, on
the contrary, who had long aimed at indepen|dence, and who dete&s;ted his
cowardice and luxury, refu&s;ed his reque&s;t. Though no Monarch was more timid
in danger, none was more pre&s;umptu|ous in pro&s;perity: he threatened them,
for refu&s;ing, with his &s;evere di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">plea&s;ure, and &s;trengthened him|&s;elf by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the Pope, in order to plun|der the kingdom.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Engli&s;h were complaining of the avarice of their
King, and his profu&s;ion to foreign favourites, the Pope's legate made his
triumphal entry to rob them of what the King had not laid hands on: the
intere&s;ts of the clergy and of the Pope were formerly one, but they now began
to flow in divided channels. The riches, which &s;ome years before &s;ettled in
their mona&s;teries at home, were now drained off to enrich a di&s;tant
kingdom, already too luxurious. The clergy, therefore, ju&s;tly dreaded the
arrival of an extraordinary le|gate, who&s;e only aims were directed by avarice
and extortion. They expo&s;tulated, but in vain, to the King, again&s;t this
unnece&s;&s;ary amba&s;&s;ador from the head of the church: the King hoped to
reap &s;ome private advantage from his arrival, and he was but little concerned
for public grievances. <PB N="102" REF="105"> In every demand the King made for
him&s;elf, the legate would take care to make one for the Pope al&s;o: he even
propo&s;ed, that the Monks &s;hould &s;ign their names to notes, where a blank
was left for the &s;um &s;pecified. The exactions, thus daily committed upon
the churches, compelled the Bi&s;hops to carry their complaints to the Pope
him|&s;elf, but the King &s;till vindicated the legate's con|duct. At length,
the prelates, quite tired with the repeated demands of the legate, who daily
had &s;ome new pretext for getting money, re&s;olved to meet and con&s;ider of
&s;ome remedy to prevent his rapacity. They accordingly a&s;&s;embled, but had
&s;carce begun to complain to each other of the mi|&s;eries they &s;uffered,
when the legate entered the a&s;&s;embly, with a demand for more money: this
they con&s;idered as an accumulation of impudence and extortion, and they gave
him a blunt denial. The legate, being di&s;appointed, for this time left the
a&s;&s;embly, and went to pillage the Scotch cler|gy with better pro&s;pects of
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>An accident happened about this time, which &s;erves as a &s;trong
in&s;tance of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the people yielded to the power of Rome.
Some bu&s;ine&s;s induced the legate to take Oxford in his way: he was received
with all that grandeur and magnificence, which, from his character, he had a
right to expect. As the luxury, in which the&s;e Italian dignitaries lived, was
great, &s;everal &s;cholars of the Univer&s;ity, while the legate's dinner was
preparing, entered his kitchen, incited by motives of curio&s;ity or hunger.
While they here and there admired the opulence and luxury of all they &s;aw, a
poor Iri&s;h &s;cholar ventured to beg relief from the cook: the cook,
in&s;tead of giving an alms, threw a ladle full of boiling water in his face; 
<PB N="103" REF="106"> an action which &s;o provoked a Welch &s;tudent who was
pre&s;ent, that, having a bow in his hand, he &s;hot the cook dead with an
arrow. The legate, hearing the tumult, retired in a fright to the tower of the
church, where he remained till night|fall. As &s;oon as he thought he might
retire with &s;afety, he ha&s;tened to the King, and complained of this
outrage. The King, with his u&s;ual mean|ne&s;s, flew into a violent
pa&s;&s;ion, and offered to give immediate &s;atisfaction, by putting the
of|fenders to death. The legate, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon
vengeance, but, at length, was appea&s;ed, by proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the
Univer&s;ity: all the &s;cholars of that &s;chool, which had offended him, were
ordered to be &s;tripped of their gowns, and to walk barefoot, with halters
about their necks, to the legate's hou&s;e, and humbly crave pardon and
ab&s;olution. It would be no ea&s;y matter to bring the &s;tudents of Oxford to
&s;uch an humiliation at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In this manner this brutal and capricious tyrant went on, leagued
with the Pope again&s;t his own dominions. He had now neither barons nor clergy
in his intere&s;t, and owed all his &s;upport to the au|thority of the papal
and royal names. The Pope con|tinued to make reiterated demands upon the
clergy, and the King would beg from his &s;ubjects at their own hou&s;es, as if
he had been a&s;king charity. At one time he would get money, by pretending to
take the cru&s;ade; at another he would prevail, by go|ing to re-conquer his
dominions in France; again he would extort aid, under pretext of portioning a
relation: and he would frequently a&s;&s;ure his par|liament of barons, that,
though he had hitherto behaved unworthily, yet, upon being &s;upplied once
more, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he would reform, <PB N="104" REF="107"> and
give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. Thus he drew forth various &s;ums, which,
without &s;hame, he be|&s;towed upon flatterers, panders to his plea&s;ures; or
an army of foreigners, which he kept to intimi|date his native dominions.</P>
<P>At length, however, the parliament, fatigued with his unperforming
promi&s;es, re&s;olved to refu&s;e his demands for the future: they therefore
entered into an a&s;&s;ociation, and the city of London was invited to accede.
At the head of this powerful combination was the Earl of Leice&s;ter, the
King's brother-in-law, who had ri&s;en into power mere|ly by his ma&s;ter's
profu&s;ene&s;s. The King, by a &s;trange ab&s;urdity of thinking, as he became
more feeble and unpopular, increa&s;ed his demands for fre&s;h &s;upplies. He
was wor&s;ted in France, and obliged to purcha&s;e a &s;hameful truce. He was
conquered by the Welch, and became contempti|ble to Scotland; yet, &s;till he
continued to har|ra&s;s his own &s;ubjects with his u&s;ual extortion, as if he
de&s;igned to create in them that awe with which he failed to impre&s;s his
enemies. The barons, finding him incorrigible, after an expe|rience of near
forty years, at length &s;hook off their allegiance, and &s;ent the King
notice, that they renounced the fealty they owed him, and now con&s;idered him
only as the common enemy of mankind.</P>
<P>Both &s;ides were now up in arms, and the coun|try again became the
theatre of civil &s;laughter. The fir&s;t advantages in this conte&s;t were in
fa|vour of the King: he was a coward in danger, and &s;hewed him&s;elf a tyrant
in victory. Flu&s;hed with the &s;ucce&s;s with which his arms had been ju&s;t
crowned, he re&s;olved to march directly to London. He made no doubt but the
city, inti|midated <PB N="105" REF="108"> by his late advantages, would declare
in his favour; and, had he formerly behaved with paternal indulgence, perhaps
his pre&s;ent hopes would not have been groundle&s;s; but a remem|brance of his
former ill u&s;age repre&s;&s;ed their loyal|ty. In&s;tead of opening their
gates to receive a conqueror, they &s;ent forth an army to oppo&s;e his entry.
Henry &s;topped his forces in a panic, and returned to meet the Earl of
Leice&s;ter, who ad|vanced with his army near Lewes in the county of
Su&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>All hopes of reconciliation being now laid a&s;ide, nothing was
thought of but the deci&s;ion of the &s;word. The Earl, advancing with his
army, drew up in order of battle near the King, who pre|pared, though with
reluctance, to receive him: the fight was begun by Prince Edward, the King's
&s;on, who attacked the Londoners with great fury, and drove them off the field
of battle: on the other hand, the King's body of forces were de|feated, after a
&s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, by the Earl of Leice&s;ter. His Maje&s;ty, who
commanded them in per&s;on, gave no in&s;tances of valour, but tame|ly
&s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken pri&s;oner, which &s;oon paved the way for the
defeat of the whole army, and Prince Edward's &s;urrendering at
di&s;|cretion.</P>
<P>The King and the Prince being thus pri&s;oners, the barons took all
advantages that the mo&s;t re|fined policy could &s;ugge&s;t. They knew how to
operate upon the King's pu&s;illanimity, and obliged him to &s;end letters to
all the governors of the kingdom, to renounce their obedience, and &s;ur|render
his ca&s;tles to the conquerors. They who draw their &s;word again&s;t their
King, &s;ays the pro|verb, &s;hould fling the &s;cabbard away. The barons, 
<PB N="106" REF="109"> with this in view, were re&s;olved entirely to new|model
the con&s;titution, for they now knew, that a compo&s;ition with the royal
captive was impo&s;&s;i|ble; and at this period we mu&s;t fix the date of
Engli&s;h liberty. The privileges of the King, the barons, and the clergy, were
but different modes of various u&s;urpations; the commonalty had little or no
&s;hare in the legi&s;lature, and only looked tame|ly on, or were led to
&s;laughter without hopes of &s;haring the rewards of victory.</P>
<P>The barons and clergy, however, now &s;aw, that the government could
not readily be tran&s;|ferred, without &s;ome greater power than they were at
pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The dethroning a King, the re&s;i&s;ting a
Pope, were actions that they could not defend upon the principles of the times:
they called in, therefore, an aid till now entirely un|known in the world, they
called in the &s;anction of the people. The authority of the barons, clergy,
and the people of England, were &s;et to oppo&s;e the royal and papal
authority. And here, my dear Charles, I cannot but admire the &s;trange
concurrence of circum&s;tances which brought this fir&s;t dawn of liberty into
being. To effect this, it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that England &s;hould be
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a conte&s;ted foreign dominion; that the King &s;hould
have frequent nece&s;&s;ities for money to pre&s;erve it; that this
nece&s;&s;arily &s;hould produce a dependence upon the barons and clergy, and
that this dependence &s;hould give them, in turn, a &s;hare of power. It was
nece&s;&s;ary, that the intere&s;ts of the clergy &s;hould be &s;eparated from
tho&s;e of the crown, and &s;hould concur in the oppo&s;ition: in &s;hort, it
was nece&s;&s;ary that the powers on both &s;ides &s;hould be &s;o exactly
balanced, that &s;o &s;mall <PB N="107" REF="110"> a weight as that of the
people, as it was then con|&s;idered, &s;hould be thrown in to turn the
&s;cale.</P>
<P>A parliament was called, in which the King was obliged to give
orders, that four Knights from each county &s;hould &s;it, in order to
repre&s;ent their re&s;pective &s;hires, and deliberate for the general
be|nefit of the people. This is the fir&s;t rude outline of an Engli&s;h
Hou&s;e of Commons; the people had been gaining &s;ome con&s;ideration &s;ince
the diminu|tion of the foeudal laws, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of corporation
charters, by which men were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;cued from the power of
their ma&s;ters, and permitted to improve a &s;pirit of freedom in towns. As
arts increa&s;ed, the number of the&s;e little republics (if I may &s;o call
them) increa&s;ed; and we find them, at the pre&s;ent period, of con|&s;equence
enough to be adopted into a partner&s;hip of the legi&s;lation. But the&s;e
privileges were grant|ed by the barons, merely to confirm their own; and, could
they have now agreed among them|&s;elves, they might have continued in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the authority of the kingdom, and the con&s;ti|tution
might thus &s;ettle into a confirmed ari&s;tocra|cy; but they grew jealous of
each other's power; they began to fear the Earl of Leice&s;ter, who had
abrogated kingly authority, and was intent only upon e&s;tabli&s;hing
de&s;poti&s;m. This produced new &s;truggles, and the&s;e ended once more in
the re&s;to|ration of the King and his family: the Earl of Leice&s;ter was
defeated and &s;lain upon the field of battle. Henry, who had been led about as
a cap|tive, and always expo&s;ed in the front of that army which had dethroned
him, was once more &s;et at liberty by his victorious &s;on Edward; and though,
to the end of life, he per&s;evered in his former fol|lies, yet the people
retained that &s;hare of liberty <PB N="108" REF="111"> which they had acquired
in the turbulent parts of his reign. A &s;pirit of liberty had now diffu&s;ed
it|&s;elf from the incorporated towns thro' the whole ma&s;s of people, and
ever after blazed forth at con|venient &s;ea&s;ons; afterwards whoever lo&s;t
they were &s;ure to be gainers; and, if in the conte&s;t they laid down their
lives, and &s;uffered all the hard&s;hips of war, yet they con&s;idered tho&s;e
calamities as trivial, if liberty were left improved and better &s;ecured to
their po&s;terity. I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>AT the death of Henry III, Edward, his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
was employed in the Holy wars, in which, though he gained nothing to the
cau&s;e for which he fought, he acquired the cha|racter of an excellent general
and an intrepid &s;ol|dier. As he came to an undi&s;puted throne, the
oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts were proportionably feeble. The barons were exhau&s;ted
by mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions, the clergy hated the Pope, and the people, as is
evi|dent from &s;ome in&s;urrections at that time, were not much &s;atisfied
with the clergy. It was natu|ral to &s;uppo&s;e, that a politic and a
conquering Prince would take this opportunity of giving the royal prerogative
its former &s;plendor and authority. Wi&s;e princes, however, are &s;atisfied
with mode|rate power, and Edward only laboured to be ter|rible to his
enemies.</P>
<P>The Welch had long enjoyed their own laws and cu&s;toms; they were
the only remains of the ancient Britons, and had &s;till pre&s;erved their
free|doms and their country uncontaminated from fo|reign <PB N="109" REF="112">
inva&s;ions: incapable, however, of re&s;i&s;ting their enemies in the plain,
their chief defence was in their inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, tho&s;e natural
bul|warks of their country. Whenever England was di&s;turbed by factions at
home, or its troops called off to wars abroad, the Welch would continually pour
in their irregular troops, and lay the open country wa&s;te with ravage and
de&s;olation. No &s;ituation can be wor&s;e, than that of &s;everal petty
principalities bordering upon each other, under different commanders, and
pur&s;uing different in|tere&s;ts. Sen&s;ible of this, Edward led a powerful
army again&s;t Lewellyn, their King: he had fre|quently before been
cha&s;ti&s;ed, obliged to beg peace, but was ever ready to &s;eize an
opportunity of making an advantageous war. Upon the approach of Edward, he took
refuge upon the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains of Snowden, and there maintained his
po&s;t without danger. The King of England, not di&s;couraged by the difficulty
of the &s;ituation, was re&s;olved to inve&s;t his army, by &s;ecuring all the
avenues by which it might e&s;cape. Po&s;ted as Lewellyn was, he might
certainly have harra&s;&s;ed his enemies without ever him&s;elf being
de&s;troyed, had not a trifling victory over a body of his be|&s;iegers induced
him to come down and face the enemy upon more equal terms. A &s;mall advantage
gained was interpreted as the beginning of the com|pletion of Merlyn's
prophecy, in which he was to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole kingdom without a rival.
Flattered with &s;uch expectations, he de&s;cends into the plain, without
con&s;idering the inequality of his forces: the Welch and the Engli&s;h now,
for the la&s;t time, drew up again&s;t each other. Lewellyn, after hav|ing
performed all that courage and de&s;peration could in&s;pire, found him&s;elf,
at la&s;t, fatally de|ceived: <PB N="110" REF="113"> he was killed upon the
field of battle, and his forces utterly routed. With him expired the
di&s;tinction of his nation; it was &s;oon after united to the kingdom of
England, and made a principa|lity, given to the elde&s;t &s;on of the crown.
Foreign conque&s;ts might add to the glory, but the pre&s;ent added to the
felicity of the kingdom. The Welch were now blended with their conquerors, and,
in the revolution of a few ages, all national animo|&s;ity was entirely
forgotten.</P>
<P>His native dominions being thus freed from eve|ry invader, the King
&s;oon had an opportunity to increa&s;e his power, by the di&s;&s;en&s;ion of
his neigh|bours. The crown of Scotland, after the death of Alexander the Third,
became de&s;titute of any apparent heir: John Bruce and Robert Baliol divided
all the &s;uffrages of the kingdom. A civil war impended, and nothing but an
umpire, ap|pointed by mutual con&s;ent, could determine the conte&s;t without
blood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> For this purpo&s;e, by a
fatal mi&s;take in the politics of the Scotch, Edward was cho&s;en, accepted
the mediation with plea&s;ure, came to Norham, and, from being cho&s;en
um|pire, claimed a &s;uperiority over the country, who&s;e crown had been
&s;ubmitted to his deci&s;ion, and a&s;&s;erted his right to the government. To
wear the appearance of ju&s;tice, however, after long de|liberations, in which
great care was taken to in|culcate his right to the crown of Scotland, he fixed
Baliol on the throne, le&s;s as King than as a va&s;&s;al of England.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by Edward, after placing Baliol on the
throne, was &s;ufficient to convince the Scots of his intentions to &s;tretch
his &s;uperior prerogative to the utmo&s;t. A merchant of Ga&s;|coigne 
<PB N="111" REF="114"> pre&s;ented a petition to him, implying, that Alexander,
late King of Scotland, was indebted to him a certain &s;um, &s;till unpaid,
notwith&s;tand|ing all his &s;ollicitations to the new King for pay|ment.
Edward eagerly embraced this opportunity of exerci&s;ing his new right, and
&s;ummoned the King of Scotland to appear at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to an&s;wer, in
per&s;on, to the complaint which was brought again&s;t him by the merchant.
Upon &s;ub|jects equally trivial he &s;ent &s;ix different &s;ummons, at
different times, in one year; &s;o that the Scotch King &s;oon perceived
him&s;elf only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the name, without the authority. Willing,
therefore, to &s;hake off &s;o trouble&s;ome a ma&s;ter, Baliol re|volted, and
procured the Pope's ab&s;olution for the infraction of his former oaths of
homage. Edward now offered the crown to Bruce, who accepted it with joy; and
thus a &s;trong party of the Scotch was added in &s;trengthening the Engli&s;h
King to &s;ubdue their native country. Edward, at the head of a numerous army,
marched into the coun|try: numberle&s;s were the victories gained on one &s;ide
and the other, in which the conquerors acquired much honour, but either country
lo&s;t the brave&s;t of its &s;ubjects. But wars like the&s;e, though mi|nutely
related by every hi&s;torian, are &s;carce worth trea&s;uring in any memory,
but that of an herald or antiquarian. The whole may be comprized in the
following &s;hort de&s;cription: one barbarous na|tion meets another in &s;ome
plain, generally by mutual appointment; little art, evolution, eva&s;ion, or
&s;ubterfuge, was practi&s;ed or known; they ru&s;h|ed upon each other, and
numbers and tumult ge|nerally decided the victory: the revolutions of the
government, and not the de&s;cription of battles fought in the&s;e reigns,
&s;erve to adorn the page of <PB N="112" REF="115"> hi&s;tory. At one
&s;ea&s;on Scotland was brought to the lowe&s;t degree of humiliation, and
Edward had laid a plan, which probably he ever had in view, of uniting, it as a
conque&s;t, to the crown of England. But his &s;cheme proved abortive, the time
of that kingdom's deliverance was at hand; they found &s;afety in de&s;pair,
and, upon the King's return to England, they once more &s;allied down from
their mountains upon the Engli&s;h army which he had left, and gained a
complete victory.</P>
<P>This was terrible news to Edward, who had already built upon that
kingdom as his own. He was now implacably exa&s;perated again&s;t the Scots,
and re&s;olved to take a &s;ignal vengeance: to this purpo&s;e, he &s;ummoned
all the va&s;&s;als of the crown, without di&s;tinction, to be ready at a time
and place particularly appointed. His intention was, to march into the heart of
that kingdom, and de&s;troy it, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, from &s;ea to
&s;ea. He &s;oon &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of the fine&s;t army England had
ever produced: the Scotch trembled at his approach, but death &s;topped the
cour&s;e of his in|tended deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he perceived that his di&s;order was to be fatal, he
&s;ent for the Prince his &s;on, whom he had appointed to &s;ucceed him, and,
taking him by the hand, earne&s;tly recommended, with his dying breath, three
things: he fir&s;t enjoined him not to recal Gave&s;tone, a flatterer, who he
knew would poi&s;on his principles; he next de&s;ired, that his heart might be
&s;ent to the holy &s;epulchre; and, thirdly, he recommended him to pro&s;ecute
the war with the Scotch, till he had entirely &s;ubdued them; de&s;iring his
bones might be carried about at the head of the army, the more effectually to
&s;trike terror into an enemy he had &s;o often &s;ubdued.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="116"> England began to grow truly formidable under
this reign, the oppo&s;ition of the barons was but feeble and ill &s;upported;
the Monarch was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ab&s;olute, though he was prudent enough
never to exert his power: he is accu&s;ed of &s;everity, and it is probable he
might have exerted ju&s;tice with too heavy an hand; yet it &s;hould be
particu|larly remarked, that he was the fir&s;t who began to di&s;pen&s;e
indi&s;criminate ju&s;tice. Before him, the people who ro&s;e in
in&s;urrections were puni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;evere manner, by the &s;word
or the gib|bet; while the nobility, who were almo&s;t always refractory, were
treated with a degree of lenity which encouraged future di&s;obedience; a
&s;mall fine, which, in fact, only fell upon their poor dependants, generally
wiped off their offences. He puni&s;hed both with equal &s;everity.</P>
<P>However, you ought to remark the alterations in the &s;pirit of the
times: the Engli&s;h, now in|corporated with their fierce Norman conquerors,
were no longer the tame con&s;enting people they formerly appeared, and always
were prepared to elude that authority which they could not re&s;i&s;t. With
this &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition a &s;pirit of cruelty al&s;o &s;eemed to enter;
regardle&s;s of their own lives, the people did not &s;eem very &s;ollicitous
about the lives of others. The penal laws now began to a&s;&s;ume more rigour:
in the times of William the Conqueror, it was a law, that no man &s;hould be
puni&s;hed with death; but that law was at pre&s;ent quite laid a&s;ide, and
&s;everal crimes were rendered capital.</P>
<P>But what gave the reign of Edward a true value with po&s;terity, was
the degree of power the people began to a&s;&s;ume during this period. The
clergy and the barons he con&s;idered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as rivals; and, to
weaken their force, he gave au|thority <PB N="114" REF="117"> to the commons: a
law was enacted, by which no tax could be-levied without their con&s;ent. His
intentions were to render him&s;elf ab&s;olute by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and,
it is but too probable, he might have become &s;o, had he lived to put his
de|&s;igns in execution; but he died at a time he was beginning to throw off
parliamentary re&s;trictions, and left the people a &s;hare of authority which
had been given them for very different purpo&s;es than the promotion of
liberty. The mo&s;t healing me|dicines are often extracted from poi&s;ons: in
&s;hort, whatever Edward's character was, as a man, as a King, he was of
infinite &s;ervice to his country.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was long an opinion of the Engli&s;h, and grounded on
ob&s;ervations made from the days of King Arthur, that, between two valiant and
able Princes in the nation, there always inter|vened a King of le&s;s &s;en&s;e
and courage, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>moins &s;uffi&s;ans de &s;ens et de
proue&s;&s;e;</HI></Q> that there was &s;ome|thing in the remark you have
hitherto &s;een in &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>No Monarch could come to a crown with more advantageous omens than
Edward II. an army prepared for victory, a people united, and an un|di&s;puted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But he &s;oon gave them rea&s;ons to fear his future conduct,
by the commencement of his reign. Regardle&s;s of his father's dying
admonitions, he di&s;continued the war with Scot|land, <PB N="115" REF="118">
and recalled Gave&s;tone, his favourite, from exile.</P>
<P>Gave&s;tone was a foreigner by birth, adorned with every
accompli&s;hment of per&s;on and mind that could create affection, but
de&s;titute of tho&s;e qualities of heart and under&s;tanding that &s;erve to
procure e&s;teem. He was beautiful, witty, brave, but, at the &s;ame time,
vicious, effeminate, and debauched: he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in all Edward's
youth|ful extravagancies and plea&s;ures, had been, to u&s;e a Latin
expre&s;&s;ion, his arbiter elegantiarum, and thus had &s;ecured this young
voluptuous Monarch's affections.</P>
<P>A prudent King may have private friends, but &s;hould never retain a
public favourite: royal fa|vour &s;hould &s;hine with indi&s;criminate
lu&s;tre, and the Monarch &s;hould ever guard again&s;t rai&s;ing tho&s;e he
mo&s;t loves to the highe&s;t preferments. In being thus bia&s;&s;ed by his
affections, he will pro|bably be induced to reward talents unequal to the
burthen of affairs, or impatient of the fatigues of application. Such was the
ca&s;e of Edward, with regard to his new favourite; he loaded him with favours,
at a time when he was giving up his title to the &s;overeignty of Scotland,
which had been &s;o hardly earned by his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The barons, at this time, were not &s;o entirely humbled, but that
they re&s;ented a conduct &s;o in|jurious to the intere&s;ts of the kingdom as
well as their own. Gave&s;tone's pride, his being a fo|reigner, his
in&s;olence, &s;oon rai&s;ed a &s;trong party again&s;t him: an army was formed
to oppo&s;e his admini&s;tration; Gave&s;tone was taken and behead|ed, without
even the formality of a trial. Thus you perceive a &s;pirit of cruelty
beginning to enter the nation; the death of Gave&s;tone was, proba|bly, 
<PB N="116" REF="119"> &s;upported by the precedents found in the for|mer
reign. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Edward the Fir&s;t, copied after him in his
faults alone; the vices of conquering Monarchs and great Kings are ever mo&s;t
dangerous, becau&s;e they mo&s;t generally pro|duce imitation.</P>
<P>From this time the &s;caffolds were drenched with Engli&s;h blood;
each party, as it happened to prove victorious, brought their pri&s;oners, as
traitors, to the block or the gibbet; never was &s;o much blood &s;pilt in a
juridical manner in England, as in this hideous reign. The Scotch, during
the&s;e &s;torms, endeavoured to fortify their government: they conquered the
Engli&s;h in more than one battle, Robert Bruce, being made King, became
powerful from the divi&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, who pretended to be his
ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Edward, in the mean time, &s;eemed only intent on pro&s;ecuting his
plea&s;ures, or becoming formi|dable to his own &s;ubjects. The mutual hatred
between him and the barons &s;eemed daily to in|crea&s;e, or, in other words,
as he &s;till became more de&s;picable in the eyes of the people, the barons,
lately depre&s;&s;ed, grew into power. His &s;upinene&s;s gave them an
opportunity of executing all their de&s;igns, &s;o that at la&s;t he &s;uffered
him&s;elf to be taken a pri&s;oner; but he was &s;oon after relea&s;ed, upon a
promi&s;e of future amendment. A certain number of the barons were admitted
into his coun|cil, and he gave his word to perform nothing with|out their
con&s;ent and approbation: but he was only born for misfortunes. This Monarch,
of an ea&s;y nature, and who, probably, if born in a pri|vate &s;tation, would
have been con&s;idered as a wor|thy man, could not live without a favourite.
Into the place which Gave&s;tone held in his affections, <PB N="117" REF="120">
Hugh Spencer, a youth of great addre&s;s and ma|ny accompli&s;hments,
&s;ucceeded. This young gen|tleman, no way intimidated by the misfortunes of
Gave&s;tone, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, pur&s;ued his conduct in every
particular; he even went beyond him in pride, avarice, and prodigality. An
uni|ver&s;al di&s;content &s;oon became vi&s;ible: all the vices of the King
were imputed to young Spencer alone, and his own were enough to &s;ink him into
ruin. The barons, therefore, once more combined to de&s;troy this favourite,
who was, in reality, with|out a protector: they therefore bani&s;hed him and
his father out of the kingdom, with great threats, if ever he attempted to
return. This indignity to the King &s;eemed to rou&s;e him from his former
lethargy; the Queen al&s;o, a bold haughty woman, endeavoured to &s;timulate
him to revenge: &s;he had received an affront on a pilgrimage to Canterbury, in
being denied admittance, by the governor, in|to the ca&s;tle of Leeds, on the
way. She there|fore per&s;uaded her weak con&s;ort, that the pre&s;ent
conjuncture was very favourable for freeing him&s;elf from the power of the
barons, and, that puni&s;h|ing the governor of Leeds would intimidate them &s;o
far, as to prevent any future oppo&s;ition. Her advice was embraced with
avidity; the King rai&s;ed an army without oppo&s;ition; he be&s;ieged the
ca&s;tle of Leeds, the governor was taken, and the Queen now had an opportunity
of &s;atiating her revenge, by beheading him.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s only &s;eemed to pu&s;h this weak Prince on to new
violences: he be&s;ieged the ca&s;tles of &s;e|veral other barons, and became
ma&s;ter of them with equal ea&s;e. To complete his contempt for all former
compacts, he recalled his young favou|rite, Spencer, once more from
bani&s;hment. We <PB N="118" REF="121"> may ea&s;ily, upon this occa&s;ion,
perceive how much the barons were declined from that degree of power they
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two or three reigns before. The Monarch, at pre&s;ent, that
oppre&s;&s;ed them, was voluptuous, ignorant, and a coward, in the ge|neral
opinion of the people; yet, feeble as he was, the barons were &s;carce able to
re&s;i&s;t him: the power of the people was now grown truly formidable, and
Edward had addre&s;s enough to procure a part of them to &s;econd his
preten&s;ions. The King now, therefore, in the meridian of power, pro&s;ecuted
the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures: the Queen, cruel by nature, and Spencer, his
favourite, actuated by re|venge, &s;timulated him to numberle&s;s acts of
cruelty. Among others who peri&s;hed in the oppo&s;ition, was Thomas, Earl of
Lanca&s;ter: this nobleman had always been &s;ignalized for his valour among
the confederate Lords, and was a peculiar oppo&s;er of the growing power of the
family of the Spencers: he was taken fighting, at the head of a body of forces
which he had, in vain, endeavoured to rally. He had no great hopes to expect
any favour from judges who were his enemies, from per&s;onal mo|tives: he was
condemned to be quartered, as a traitor; but, from a regard to his &s;tation,
the King changed his puni&s;hment to beheading. In this manner nine other Lords
were executed at York, as a terror to the kingdom; but the&s;e ter|rors could
not &s;ecure a Monarch, who was in him|&s;elf contemptible. Whatever might have
been the Earl of Lanca&s;ter's real character, his death left it uncertain,
whether he acted with views to get him&s;elf created King, or was only the
champion of public liberty. However that be, the people in general had his
memory in great veneration, and con&s;idered him as a martyr. We may by this
&s;ee <PB N="119" REF="122"> what &s;ide in this quarrel was e&s;pou&s;ed by
the cler|gy; immediately after the Earl's death, miracles were &s;aid to be
wrought at his tomb, and every pretended miracle of this kind was productive of
a thou&s;and enemies to the King.</P>
<P>The favourite Spencer and his father &s;till gave an unbounded
&s;cope to their revenge; not content with putting to death the heads of the
oppo&s;ite party, with depriving others of their e&s;tates, and with condemning
great numbers to perpetual ba|ni&s;hment, they were re&s;olved to level their
rage again&s;t Roger Mortimer, now actually in their cu&s;tody, and confined
within the Tower. There were few circum&s;tances that could apparently &s;creen
him from their re&s;entment; he had been openly in arms, and active in the
oppo&s;ition; he had no character to render his puni&s;hment unpo|pular, and
none that he knew to intercede for him with the King: yet he found his
puni&s;hment re|mitted, to his a&s;toni&s;hment, notwith&s;tanding all the
&s;ollicitations of his enemies to the contrary. The Queen was fallen in love
with this youth, and u&s;ed all her intere&s;t to procure his pardon: an
intimacy had actually commenced between them; and this protection, with which
he was publicly honoured by her, drew down the re&s;entment of the two
favourites. In this oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, Edward &s;eemed entirely
pa&s;&s;ive; he wi&s;hed to oblige both parties, and one day gave orders to
&s;creen young Mortimer from pur&s;uit, and the next, to &s;ecure him wherever
he could be detected: the feeble King knew not how to refu&s;e any reque&s;t,
when he loved tho&s;e who made the demand.</P>
<P>A di&s;&s;en&s;ion thus between two parties, who &s;hared the
affections of the King, mu&s;t &s;oon ter|minate in the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of
either. To get the <PB N="120" REF="123"> Queen removed, the Spencers contrived
to per|&s;uade her to go upon a certain negotiation to the court of her
brother, the King of France. With this propo&s;al, tho' from her enemies, the
Queen readily complied; &s;he fore&s;aw it would give her an uncontrouled
liberty of enjoying the company of her gallant, and might give her power of
being revenged upon his oppre&s;&s;ors. Philip the Fair, who was at that time
upon the throne of France, pur&s;ued the politics of every wi&s;e King; he
encouraged the Queen, his &s;i&s;ter, to oppo&s;e Edward, her hu&s;band, and
thus, by dividing his enemies, he hoped to weaken them. Thus heart|ened, &s;he
loudly inveighed again&s;t the favourites of the King, levied troops in France
to oppo&s;e their power, and, with this army, landed in Eng|land, where her
expectations were an&s;wered, in being joined by a powerful body of
malecontents. Mortimer, her lover, was with her at the head of the&s;e troops,
at the &s;ame time that the favou|rite Spencer was the heart of the oppo&s;ite
party.</P>
<P>Edward was little able to with&s;tand his enemies: all his
endeavours to rai&s;e troops proved ineffectual; none would venture to expo&s;e
them&s;elves in the King's defence, for they &s;aw that an ignominious death
mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a defeat, and ingratitude of victory. The Queen
took Spencer, the father, at Bri&s;tol: this gentleman, four&s;core and ten
years old, had pa&s;&s;ed a youth of tranquil|lity and reputation; he had been
e&s;teemed and loved by all the kingdom, but his fond compliance with his
&s;on's ambition involved his old age in the turbulence of faction: he was
immediately hanged up in his armour, without even the forma|lity of a trial.
His unhappy &s;on did not long &s;ur|vive him; he was taken, with a few more,
at|tending <PB N="121" REF="124"> the King their ma&s;ter, in an ob&s;cure
con|vent in Wales. Revenge, and not ju&s;tice, prompt|ed all the puni&s;hments
of this reign. The Queen had not patience to &s;tay, till the meeting of a
par|liament, to de&s;tory her enemy; &s;he ordered him to be produced before
the in&s;ulting populace, en|joyed her&s;elf the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him led
to the place of execution, where he was hanged on a gibbet fifty feet high.
Several other Lords &s;hared his fate, all de&s;erving pity indeed, had they
not formerly ju&s;tified this inhumanity by &s;etting a cruel example.</P>
<P>The unhappy King, now abandoned, &s;aw him|&s;elf in the power of
his enemies, without a &s;ingle friend to &s;tand between him and univer&s;al
reproach; he was conducted to the capital, amid&s;t the in&s;ults and
reproaches of his &s;ubjects; confined in the Tower, judged by the parliament,
and &s;olemnly depo&s;ed. He was a&s;&s;igned a pen&s;ion for his &s;up|port;
his &s;on, a youth of fourteen, was crowned King, and the Queen appointed
regent during his minority.</P>
<P>The depo&s;ed Monarch but a &s;hort time &s;urvived his misfortunes:
he was &s;ent from pri&s;on to pri&s;on, a wretched outca&s;t, and the &s;port
of his mercenary keepers: in the&s;e journies they made him &s;uffer all the
indignities, that cruel and ingenious villainy could devi&s;e. Among others, it
is &s;aid, they &s;haved him for &s;port, in the open fields, u&s;ing water
from the neighbouring ditch: the genius of the people mu&s;t &s;urely have
&s;uffered a gradual deterioration, or they would never have permitted the
venerable head of Maje&s;ty, a Monarch, who&s;e greate&s;t fault was the
violence of his friend&s;hips, to be u&s;ed with &s;o much indignity. What
firm|ne&s;s &s;oever the depo&s;ed Prince had hitherto &s;hewn 
<PB N="122" REF="125"> in his misfortunes, it left him upon this occa&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> he looked upon his mercile&s;s
in&s;ulters with an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of fallen
Maje&s;ty, and &s;hed a torrent of tears<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the cruelty of his death alone was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nting to ter|minate a life of
complete mi&s;ery. The la&s;t place of his impri&s;onment was Berkley ca&s;tle:
here he was kept totally de&s;titute of all the comforts, and almo&s;t all the
nece&s;&s;aries of life. But the&s;e mi&s;eries were not long to continue: the
two keepers, en|tering his apartment one night as he lay in bed, to &s;tifle
his cries, covered his face with a pillow, and then, with a cruelty not to be
paralleled, thru&s;t an horn pipe up his body, through which they ran a red-hot
iron, and burnt his bowels: his horrid &s;hrieks, however, were heard at a
di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, and, though all po&s;&s;ible care was taken to
conceal it, his murder &s;oon after was di&s;covered by one of the accomplices.
Misfortunes, like his, mu&s;t ever create pity, and, a puni&s;hment, &s;o
di&s;|proportionate to his guilt, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;often the &s;everity
of reproach.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FANCY you now begin to have &s;ome faint idea of the origin of our
happy con&s;titution; and, as I am going to lead you to a reign which gave new
&s;trength to the people, permit me to entertain you a moment with the &s;pirit
of thinking in the na|tion, at that juncture I am &s;peaking of. By the
continual admi&s;&s;ion of foreigners, in &s;everal of the preceding reigns,
the number of the commons <PB N="123" REF="126"> was &s;urpri&s;ingly
increa&s;ed; and the introduction of &s;ome new manufactures, of wearing
woollen cloaths, and making gla&s;s, for in&s;tance, &s;till de|crea&s;ed the
retinue of the nobles, and threw great|er numbers of the inhabitants into
chartered towns. The barons, however, &s;till continued to re&s;ide at their
ca&s;tles in the country, gave laws to the pea|&s;ants around them, and
exerci&s;ed a de&s;potic autho|rity over all their dependants. The clergy had,
for &s;ome time, been at variance with the Pope, and this diffen&s;ion
contributed to &s;trip the ma&s;k of &s;anctity from both: the divi&s;ion of
the church was a mo&s;t certain means of rendering it contemptible, &s;ince all
its &s;trength lay only in the influence it had over the minds of its votaries.
But, there was another principle, which had been, for &s;ome time, operating,
and which, in time, promi&s;ed to be a certain means of dimini&s;hing the power
of the barons and the clergy; I mean a diminution of <HI>per&s;onal
&s;ervice</HI> in war. In former times, every va&s;&s;al was to appear, at the
command of his lord, with hor&s;e attendants, and all the apparatus
ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a campaign. If the nobility, or va&s;&s;als of the crown,
refu&s;ed to march, the King was un|able to compel them. In this manner a
combina|tion of the nobility had it ever in their power to give laws to the
crown, becau&s;e they were not only the deliberating power, but the acting
power al&s;o: but, from the increa&s;e of the people, from the more exten&s;ive
u&s;e of money in&s;tead of barter, and from the number of independant
foreigners ready to accept pay, from the&s;e cau&s;es, I &s;ay, the Kings began
to levy armies without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nobility. Monarchs now only
wanted mo|ney to be at the head of armies as numerous and powerful as they
thought proper; wherever money <PB N="124" REF="127"> was, there lay power;
and, the people, by traffic and indu&s;try, beginning to grow rich, they were
nece&s;&s;arily admitted into &s;ome &s;hare in the legi&s;la|ture. Thus we
&s;ee the nobility, the clergy, and the people, different from what they were
two or three reigns before this; and the &s;trength of the King did not
&s;uffer a le&s;s mutation. Former Mo|narchs might be con&s;idered only as the
fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful Baron of the land: a Baron was, in miniature, what
the King was in the great. The Monarch had &s;carce any real power but what he
derived from his own crown-lands and va&s;&s;als: when he was re&s;olved to
exert his &s;trength, he could only command his own tenants, and tho&s;e who
held immediately under him; the barons were &s;ummoned, indeed; but, if they
were di&s;plea&s;ed, they might refu&s;e their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and all their
de|pendants were obliged to imitate their example; the&s;e acknowledged
&s;ubjection, not to the King, but their own ma&s;ter; and nothing but a civil
war with the refractory nobleman could bring him to ju&s;tice. But the face of
the old con&s;titution was now beginning to be changed; every order in the
&s;tate began to have a mutual dependence on each other; the power of the King
to extend to the highe&s;t and the lowe&s;t of his &s;ubjects, and oppo&s;ite
intere&s;ts to concur for the benefit of all.</P>
<P>This change of government &s;eemed to influ|ence the manners of the
nation; a &s;pirit of gal|lantry prevailed, which, probably, took its fir&s;t
ri&s;e in tho&s;e Ea&s;tern countries, which had long been famous for every
luxurious refinement. Hi&s;|torians repre&s;ent the kingdom as immer&s;ed in
de|bauchery and licentiou&s;ne&s;s: that ladies, laying a&s;ide their
mode&s;ty, &s;eemed to glory in the lo&s;s of their virtue. Nothing, &s;ay
they, was more com|mon, <PB N="125" REF="128"> than to &s;ee them riding in
troops to the tournaments, dre&s;&s;ed like cavaliers, with &s;words by their
&s;ides, their hor&s;es adorned with rich trap|pings, and behaving with more
than ma&s;culine ef|frontery. Whatever Monks may ob&s;erve upon this &s;ubject,
this aukwardly gallant behaviour, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, expre&s;&s;ed a degree
of growing ele|gance in the times, and that the people were emerg|ing from
primitive barbarity.</P>
<P>Under Edward III, the con&s;titution of our par|liaments, and the
whole frame of our government, became reduced into a better form. A &s;pirit of
liberty breathes in all his laws: yet, no King knew how to make him&s;elf more
ab&s;olute. As the father lo&s;t his crown and his life, in the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable manner, by &s;uffering him&s;elf to be go|verned by his
mini&s;ters, and protecting them from the re&s;entments of the people; &s;o the
&s;on very early exerted his own authority, and freed him&s;elf from the
guardian&s;hip, or rather &s;ubjection, of his mo|ther the Queen, and her
paramour, who had long oppre&s;&s;ed the nation, and di&s;honoured him, by
their &s;candalous conduct. Mortimer was dragged from the Queen's apartment, in
the mo&s;t ignominious manner, while &s;he implored, all the while, that they
would &s;pare the gentle Mortimer. But the young King was deaf to her
intreaties; the pity which &s;he once refu&s;ed her unhappy hu&s;band was now
denied her: the parliament condemned Mor|timer to die, without being permitted
to plead, as he had &s;erved Spencer &s;ome time before. He fell by the hands
of the hangman; and I&s;abella was confined to the ca&s;tle of Ri&s;ings, with
a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds a year. Her confine|ment was &s;evere,
though &s;he &s;urvived her di&s;grace twenty-five years, and, abandoned to
univer&s;al <PB N="126" REF="129"> contempt, wept in &s;olitude rather her
misfortunes than her vices.</P>
<P>Edward III. well knew, that a conquering Mo|narch was fitte&s;t to
plea&s;e a warlike people. The Scotch had long triumphed with impunity; he
therefore began his reign by reducing them to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful
circum&s;tances, and once more brought them to acknowledge his &s;overeignty
over their crown. But he was &s;oon drawn off from the&s;e conque&s;ts to
objects of greater victories: a new &s;cene began to be opened in France, and
Europe, in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, began to doubt whether Ed|ward's claims to that
kingdom were &s;ecured to him by right of inheritance, or by the rights of
conque&s;t. France, at that time, was by no means &s;o exten&s;ive as at
pre&s;ent: it comprehended neither Dauphine, nor Provence, nor Franche Comte.
It was rendered &s;till more feeble, from the nature of its government;
&s;everal powerful neighbours, who pretended to be va&s;&s;als of that crown,
rather &s;erved to weaken than &s;trengthen the monarchy.</P>
<P>The people of that kingdom were unhappy, from their mutual
divi&s;ions; and the King, at that time, was &s;till more &s;o. The three
&s;ons of Philip the Fair, in full parliament, accu&s;ed their wives of
adultery; they were each condemned, and or|dered to be impri&s;oned for life.
Lewis Huttin, the elde&s;t &s;on, cau&s;ed his wife to be &s;trangled; her
lovers died by a new kind of puni&s;hment, they were flead alive.</P>
<P>After the death of Lewis Huttin, King of France, a que&s;tion
aro&s;e about the validity of the Salic law; a law made in the early period of
French Monar|chy, importing, that no woman &s;hould rule. As this is a
&s;ubject of &s;ome importance in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, it is nece&s;&s;ary
to expatiate here a lit|tle: <PB N="127" REF="130"> they had hitherto never
inquired, in France, whether a female could &s;ucceed in the kingdom. Laws are
only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened already, and, as an
in&s;tance of this kind had never occurred, there were no laws to direct them.
Precedents, in le&s;&s;er in&s;tances, were the only guides in &s;uch a
circum&s;tance, but the&s;e precedents had varied with the occa&s;ion. The
parliament of France had often adjudged the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to women; as
Artois was formerly given to a female in prejudice of the male heir. The
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Champagne had been, on &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions, given to the
daughters, and, on others, they were held unqualified to &s;ucceed. We thus
&s;ee that right changed with power; and ju&s;tice, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, was
either unknown or di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>Lewis Huttin left an only daughter, and two brothers: the elder,
Philip the Tall, a&s;&s;umed the crown, in prejudice of Huttin's daughter, and
at|tempted to cover his u&s;urpation by the Salic law. The younger brother,
Charles the Fair, jealous of his elder brother's fortune, oppo&s;ed his
preten|&s;ions, and a&s;&s;erted the daughter's right to &s;ucceed. This
cau&s;e was carried before the French parlia|ment, and decided in favour of
Philip. This Monarch enjoyed the crown but a &s;hort time, and, dying, left
only daughters to &s;ucceed him: Charles the Fair, however, was now of a
diffe|rent &s;entiment from what he had been formerly; he now maintained the
law for the exclu&s;ion of females, becau&s;e it made in his favour. He
&s;eized the crown without oppo&s;ition, and enjoyed it for &s;ome time, but,
dying, left his wife with child. As there was now no apparent heir, the next
heir to the crown was to be regent, and two per&s;ons a&s;&s;erted their claim
upon this occa&s;ion: Edward III, <PB N="128" REF="131"> laid his claim, as
being, by his mother I&s;abella, who was daughter of Philip the Fair, and
&s;i&s;ter to the three la&s;t Kings of France, rightful heir to the crown.
Philip Valois, on the other hand, had &s;eized upon it, as being the next heir
by the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The claims of Philip were preferred; he was
con&s;tituted regent of France, and, the Queen being unfortunately brought
to-bed of a daughter, he was unanimou&s;ly elected King. He was crowned by his
&s;ubjects with univer&s;al &s;ati&s;|faction, had the appellation of Philip
the Fortu|nate given him, and to this he added tho&s;e which might merit good
fortune, virtue and ju&s;tice. Among other in&s;tances of his felicity, he
might reckon that of the homage paid him by Edward, his rival, which he came to
offer at Amiens: how|ever, this homage was &s;oon followed by a war, and Edward
di&s;puted that crown, of which he had ju&s;t before declared him&s;elf the
va&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>A brewer at Ghent was one of tho&s;e who gave the greate&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Edward in this war, and determined him to a&s;&s;ume the
title of King of France. This citizen's name was James Ardevet, grown too
powerful for a &s;ubject, and one of tho&s;e, according to Machiavel, whom
Kings ought to flatter or de&s;troy. Thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, Edward made a
powerful inva&s;ion: upon landing, he was chal|lenged by Philip to try their
fortune upon equal terms, in &s;ome appointed plain. Edward accept|ed the
challenge, for in every action this Prince affected the hero; but, &s;ome
ob&s;tacles intervening, the war was pro&s;ecuted in the u&s;ual manner, by
taking every advantage where it happened to offer.</P>
<P>In the&s;e battles there are little materials for in|&s;truction,
nor can they afford any thing more en|tertaining, than the hi&s;tory of a
maroding party <PB N="129" REF="132"> in one of our modern gazettes. It is
&s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes only drew on the great
and deci&s;ive victory of Cre&s;&s;y, which every hone&s;t Engli&s;hman
boa&s;ts of to this very hour. In this memorable battle, Philip was at the head
of an hundred thou&s;and men, and Edward only of thirty thou&s;and. The Black
Prince, his &s;on, as yet but a youth of fifteen, commanded the fir&s;t line of
the Engli&s;h army. The &s;econd was con|ducted by the Earls of Northampton and
Arundel; and the body of re&s;erve was headed by the King in per&s;on. He and
the Prince of Wales had that morning received the &s;acrament with great
devo|tion, and his behaviour denoted the calm intrepi|dity of a man re&s;olved
on conque&s;t or death. The army being thus arranged, the King rode from rank
to rank, with a chearful countenance; bad his &s;oldiers remember the honour of
their country, while his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of
enthu&s;ia&s;tic expectation. To oppo&s;e the Engli&s;h, Philip had drawn up
his formidable army in three divi&s;ions al&s;o; the fir&s;t commanded by John
of Luxembourg, the blind King of Bohe|mia; the &s;econd was led by the Count of
Alencon, and, Philip, in per&s;on, commanded the body of re&s;erve. This was
the fir&s;t battle that the Black Prince had &s;een, but he now appeared
foremo&s;t in the very &s;hock, and continued, for &s;ome time, to turn the
fortune of the day; but his courage would have been &s;oon oppre&s;&s;ed by
numbers, had not the Earl of Northampton come to his relief. The very
thicke&s;t of the battle was now gathered round him, and the valour of a boy
filled even veterans with a&s;toni&s;hment: but their &s;urprize at his
cou|rage could not give way to their &s;ears for his per|&s;on; apprehen&s;ive
that &s;ome misfortune might hap|pen <PB N="130" REF="133"> to him in the end,
they &s;ent the King word to ha&s;ten to the Prince's relief. Edward, who had
all this time viewed the engagement from a wind|mili, with great deliberation
a&s;ked if his &s;on was dead; and, being an&s;wered, that he &s;till lived and
was giving a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tances of valour, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Then tell my Generals,</HI> cried the King,
<HI>that he &s;hall have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me; the honour of this day
&s;hall be his, and he &s;hall be indebted to his own merit alone for
victory.</HI></Q> Upon this occa&s;ion thirty thou&s;and of the French were
killed in the field of battle, and the day after they experienced another
defeat. This victory is partly a&s;cribed to four pieces of artillery, which
the Engli&s;h fir&s;t made u&s;e of here, and the u&s;e of which had been but
lately di&s;covered. Edward, after two victories gained in two days, took
Calais, of which the Engli&s;h remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion two hundred and
ten years.</P>
<P>This war, which was at once carried on in three different counties
of France, thinned the inha|bitants of the invaded country, and drained that of
the invaders. But a de&s;truction, &s;till more ter|rible than that of war,
contributed, at this time, to de&s;olate the wretched inhabitants of Europe. A
pe&s;tilence more terrible than any mentioned in former hi&s;tory, which had
already almo&s;t di&s;peo|pled A&s;ia and Afric, came to &s;ettle upon the
we&s;|tern world, with increa&s;ed malignity. The fourth part of the people
were cut off by it: in London it raged with &s;uch violence, that in one year's
&s;pace there were buried, in Charter-hou&s;e church|yard, above fifty
thou&s;and per&s;ons. It was in the mid&s;t of this terrible &s;courge of
nature, that the ambition of Edward and Philip were contending for new
conque&s;ts, and adding to the calamities of mankind. The&s;e ravages, however,
were &s;ilently <PB N="131" REF="134"> repaired by commerce and indu&s;try:
tho&s;e arts, which were then de&s;pi&s;ed by Princes, were laying the &s;eeds
of future opulence and increa&s;ed popu|lation. The&s;e arts were travelling,
gradually, from Italy, and had begun to find harbour in England: the
refinements and the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e every day began to improve, but
intellectual refinement was yet unknown: &s;en&s;ual enjoyments mu&s;t ever be
carried to &s;ome height, before man|kind can find lei&s;ure or ta&s;te for
entertainments of a more delicate nature.</P>
<P>During the Engli&s;h victories on the continent, the Scotch, ever
willing to embrace a favourable opportunity of rapine or revenge, invaded
Eng|land with a numerous army. This unexpected inva&s;ion, at &s;uch a
juncture, alarmed the Engli&s;h, but, however, was not capable of
di&s;heartening them. Lionel, Edward's &s;on, who was left guar|dian of England
during his father's ab&s;ence, was yet but a boy, incapable of commanding an
army; but the victories on the continent even &s;eemed to in&s;pire women with
ardour. Philippa, Edward's Queen, took upon her to repul&s;e the enemy, in
per&s;on: to that end, heading the troops drawn to|gether from all parts, with
wonderful expedition, &s;he marched directly again&s;t the Scots, and offer|ed
them battle. The Scotch King was no le&s;s impatient to engage: he imagined a
victory would be ea&s;y again&s;t undi&s;ciplined troops, and headed by a
woman: but he was mi&s;erably deceived; he had not only the mortification to
lo&s;e the day, but to be made a pri&s;oner by the hands of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e conque&s;ts abroad were, however, no way favourable to the
cau&s;e of liberty at home. As the King became victorious, he nece&s;&s;arily
in|crea&s;ed in independence. The barons, clergy, <PB N="132" REF="135"> and
people, balanced each other's power; the royal power alone was growing beyond
its bounds. Yet Edward was too &s;en&s;ible a Monarch to give open di&s;gu&s;t;
he was only laying a foundation of de|&s;poti&s;m for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
build upon; and, had he been of equal capacity with his father, he might have
&s;eized upon public liberty with impu|nity. But I have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the
bounds of a let|ter, without coming to the conclu&s;ion of this Prince's reign;
I mu&s;t therefore refer you to my next.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have already &s;een how unju&s;tly the peo|ple di&s;tribute
titles to Kings, before they have de&s;erved them: you have &s;een the &s;econd
Edward called the Father of his country, in the beginning of his reign; and yet
fall, in the end, a mi&s;erable &s;acrifice to its re&s;entment. You have
&s;een Philip Valois, &s;irnamed the Fortunate, upon coming to the crown,
&s;uffering the mo&s;t &s;ignal de|feats, but &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>John &s;ucceeded Philip in the throne of France, but had his
preten&s;ions conte&s;ted by Edward the Black Prince, who commanded the army of
his father. This young Prince's gallantry, bravery, and mode&s;ty, had won the
affections of his &s;ol|diers, and he almo&s;t became invincible at their head.
John, in the mean time, was at the head of a divided and factious nobility; the
govern|ment <PB N="133" REF="136"> of France, being under this John, exactly
what that of England had been under a Prince of the &s;ame name &s;ome reigns
before. They had their parliaments of barons, de&s;potic over their own
hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and they obliged John of France to &s;ign a
charter, very much re&s;embling the Magna Charta, which had been &s;igned by
the Engli&s;h Monarch. The warlike re&s;ources of France and England were,
therefore, at this time very un|equal. John was at the head of a nobility which
acknowledged no &s;ubordination among&s;t each other: they led their dependant
&s;laves to the fight, and obeyed &s;uperior command only as it &s;uited their
in|clination; their King might more ju&s;tly be &s;aid to command a number of
&s;mall armies under di&s;tinct leaders, than one va&s;t machine operating with
uni|formity and united force. The French barons paid their own &s;oldiers,
puni&s;hed their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, and rewarded their fidelity. But very
dif|ferent were the forces of England: the main body of the Engli&s;h army was
compo&s;ed of the people, indi&s;criminately levied, paid by the King, and
regarding him as the &s;ource of preferment or di&s;|grace. In&s;tead of
per&s;onal attendance, the nobi|lity contributed &s;upplies in money; and there
was only &s;uch a number of nobles in the army, as might keep the &s;pirit of
honour alive, without dimini&s;hing military &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>With an army thus compo&s;ed, the Black Prince advanced to
Poictiers, and ravaged a country that once belonged to his ance&s;tors. King
John, at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, came up to give him battle: the
Engli&s;h army was in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that he might readily have
&s;tarved it into any terms he thought proper, but he was impa|tient of &s;uch
a delay: both generals committed <PB N="134" REF="137"> unpardonable faults;
the one in being led thus into a defile, the other in not taking a proper
ad|vantage of the &s;ituation. But, at this age, we mu&s;t not expect Cae&s;ars
or Hannibals to conduct armies; ignorant generals were oppo&s;ed by gene|rals
&s;till more ignorant. The battle of Poictiers, which &s;oon followed, very
much re&s;embled that of Cre&s;&s;y: the &s;uperior di&s;cipline of the
Engli&s;h ar|my came off victorious, the flower of the French were cut off, and
the King, being wounded in the face, was taken pri&s;oner. A particular, worth
noting, is, that he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to one of his own &s;ubjects, whom
he had formerly bani&s;hed, and who now fought for his enemies. Of four &s;ons
the King of France had with him, the three elde&s;t quickly fled, and, by their
cowardice, con|tributed to the defeat of the army: his fourth and younge&s;t
&s;on, as yet but thirteen years old, &s;till fought by his father, &s;tuck
near him in all the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of the field, and, at length, was taken
pri&s;oner by his &s;ide. This is a remarkable in&s;tance of the education
Princes then gave their children.</P>
<P>This victory was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the valour of the
Black Prince, but his mode&s;ty, after conque&s;t, was &s;till more remarkable.
In the mo&s;t humble manner he remon&s;trated with his royal captive, who was
complaining of his mi&s;|fortunes, that &s;till he had the comfort left to
re|flect, that though he lo&s;t the victory, yet his cou|rage de&s;erved it,
and that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference to his per&s;on &s;hould never be wanting
to make him forget his captivity. In April following, the Prince arrived in
England, bringing his pri&s;oner with him, entering into London in a remarkable
manner. The Prince, upon the left, rode a little black hor&s;e, while the royal
pri&s;oner was mounted <PB N="135" REF="138"> on a &s;tately white charger,
remarkable for its fur|niture and beauty.</P>
<P>Two Kings, pri&s;oners in the &s;ame court, at the &s;ame time, were
con&s;idered as glorious conque&s;ts; but all that England gained by them was
only glo|ry. Whatever was acquired in France, with all the &s;plendors of
triumph, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and in a manner, &s;ilently lo&s;t, without
even the morti|fication of a defeat. The treaties that were made with the
captive Kings, as may be ea&s;ily imagined, were highly to the advantage of
their conquerors; but tho&s;e treaties were no longer ob&s;erved than while the
Engli&s;h had it in their power to enforce obedience. It is true, John held to
his engage|ments as far as was in his power; but, by being a pri&s;oner he
lo&s;t his authority, and his misfortunes rendered him contemptible. Upon his
return from captivity, he not only found him&s;elf without fi|nances, but at
the head of an exhau&s;ted &s;tate; &s;oldiers without di&s;cipline, and
pea&s;ants without law. One of the chiefs of the banditti, upon this
occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;umed the title of <HI>The Friend of God, and the Enemy of
Mankind.</HI> A citizen of Sens, called John of Gouge, al&s;o got him&s;elf, by
means of robberies, to be acknowledged King, and cau&s;ed as many calamities by
his deva&s;tations, as the real King had cau&s;ed by his misfortunes. Such was
the &s;tate of France upon the arrival of John from England; yet, &s;uch was
the ab&s;urdity of this Monarch, that he immediately prepared for a cru|&s;ade
into the Holy Land, before he was &s;carce re|placed on his throne: had his
exhau&s;ted &s;ubjects been able to furni&s;h him out for this chimerical
project, it is probable he would have gone through with it, but their
mi&s;eries were &s;uch, as to be even incapable of paying his ran&s;om; upon
which he <PB N="136" REF="139"> again returned to England, where he died in
le&s;s than a year. It is &s;aid his pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s of
Sali&s;bury was the real cau&s;e of this journey; and, indeed, his age, he
being near &s;ixty, when men too often indulge this prepo&s;terous pa&s;&s;ion,
and the gallantry of the times &s;eem to countenance this opinion.</P>
<P>If England, during the&s;e &s;hining revolutions, gained any real
advantage, it was only that of having a &s;pirit of elegance and honour now
diffu&s;ed through every rank of people. The meane&s;t &s;ol|dier now began to
follow his leader from love, and not compul&s;ion; he was brave from
&s;entiment alone, and had the honour of his country beating at his heart, even
though in the humble&s;t &s;tation. This was the time when chivalry was at the
high|e&s;t, and all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of England, at this pe|riod, were owing
to a concurrence of circum&s;tances not much regarded by hi&s;torians: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>A romantic nation was led on by a romantic
King.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This &s;pirit of chivalry, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to &s;often
the ferocity of the age; it was a mixture of love, genero&s;ity, and war. You
have already &s;een, that the &s;ons of Princes and the nobility, in|&s;tead of
being bred to arts, or poli&s;hed by the &s;ciences, were brought into the
field at an early age, and in&s;tructed in no other arts, but tho&s;e of
arms.</P>
<P>This in&s;truction con&s;i&s;ted in little more than merely how to
&s;it on hor&s;e-back, to wield the lance, to run at the ring, to flouri&s;h at
a tourna|ment, to fall at the feet of a mi&s;tre&s;s, and attain &s;uch
accompli&s;hments as inured their bodies to bear the fatigues of a campaign.
The rules of tactics, of incampments, of &s;tratagems, or &s;orti|fications,
were but little minded by any.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="140"> Charles the Wi&s;e, of France, &s;oon
therefore, by a finely conducted policy, regained whatever was lo&s;t by John,
his predece&s;&s;or. Edward the Black Prince, emaciated by a lingering
con&s;ump|tion, died at the palace of We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the forty-&s;ixth
year of his age. England began to wear a face of di&s;content; the public
trea&s;ure was lavi&s;hed without any advantage to the kingdom; the &s;ubjects
laboured under numberle&s;s grievances; in &s;hort, the kingdom &s;eemed now to
feel, that a nation might be at once very victorious and very unhappy. But, to
complete their mi&s;eries, Ed|ward, their King, was now no longer what he was
in the earlier parts of his reign: he was &s;unk into unmanly indolence, and
gave him&s;elf up to the en|joyment of loo&s;e de&s;ire, in the arms of a
favourite concubine, called Allice Perrers. His parliament made frequent
remon&s;trances again&s;t this ba&s;e ob|livion of him&s;elf: the parliaments,
at this time, were not as formerly, factions ready to oppre&s;s public liberty,
but a&s;&s;emblies of wi&s;e and good men, &s;edulous for common welfare, and
of wi&s;|dom equal to the rectitude of their intentions; they frequently
remon&s;trated again&s;t the King's and his mini&s;ters conduct; they, at one
time, had in|fluence &s;ufficient to get his concubine removed, but he &s;oon
took her back, for the pa&s;&s;ions of age are incurable. In her company he
forgot all the burdens, duties, and fatigues of &s;tate, and left the kingdom
to be plundered by a rapacious mi|ni&s;try: he did not live to &s;urvive the
con&s;equences of his bad conduct; he died at Shene in Surry, de&s;erted by
all, even by tho&s;e who had formerly grown rich by his bounty. Richard II,
&s;on of the Black Prince, was con&s;tituted his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, 
<PB N="138" REF="141"> and came to govern a di&s;contented people, a rapa|cious
mini&s;try, and an impoveri&s;hed &s;tate. The&s;e were the calamities
con&s;equent upon the errors of the preceding reign. Edward III. e&s;caped
them, but they fell heavily upon Richard, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Dear Charles,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE faults of conquerors, as I have already ob&s;erved, generally
fall upon their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Richard II. came to the throne of his
grandfather, when yet but eleven, and found the people di&s;con|tented, and
poor. The gentry were, in fact, luxurious, a &s;pirit of profu&s;ion had
entered with the &s;pirit of gallantry; this nece&s;&s;arily produced indolence
and rapacity among the higher orders of the kingdom, and their wants mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily produce an oppre&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The regents, however, appointed during the King's minority, &s;eemed
no way &s;ollicitous to ap|pea&s;e the&s;e murmurings. The Duke of Lanca&s;ter,
better known by the name of John of Ghaunt, in the very beginning,
di&s;gu&s;ted the people, by robbing two Knights of a pri&s;oner, which they
had taken in war; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;everal expeditions again&s;t the
French and Scotch happen|ed to be carried on without &s;ucce&s;s. But a new
engagement, entered into by the crown, of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing Portugal, at a time
when the government was in&s;ulted by nearer enemies, rai&s;ed the people's
in|dignation. To &s;upport this unnece&s;&s;ary alliance, a &s;ub&s;idy was to
be levied by a poll-tax, payable <PB N="139" REF="142"> by all above the age of
fifteen: this, at la&s;t, rai&s;ed the people's refentment into an
in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the numbers, who by war, by a re&s;idence in
towns, and by other means, had be|come free, yet there were &s;till multitudes
in the country who had lands in villenage, that, as yet, were only &s;laves to
their lords from whom they held. The&s;e men had &s;een the charms of liberty,
from its effects upon others; and they panted for freedom them&s;elves. The
luxury and opulence which they &s;aw others enjoy, but for which they toiled,
became an incentive to them to &s;truggle for liberty al&s;o. Several of
the&s;e had become opulent enough to purcha&s;e their freedom, but, by an
un|ju&s;t act of parliament, tho&s;e purcha&s;es were de|clared of no validity.
This the pea&s;ants con&s;ider|ed as an infraction of the laws of humanity, and
&s;uch, indeed, it actually was. A parliament of lords, and rich commoners, in
this in&s;tance, feem|ed to have no regard for the rights of men whom they
con&s;idered as &s;laves, as if &s;ome orders of man|kind were held even too
vile to find ju&s;tice. The minds of the people were, therefore, thus prepared
for &s;edition, when the manner of collecting the polltax provoked them to open
revolt.</P>
<P>We have, in preceding reigns, perceived popu|lar in&s;urrections
only in the towns; we now find the &s;pirit of &s;editious liberty &s;preading
into the country. Citizens, at fir&s;t, begin to perceive their own &s;trength,
and next the &s;ame manner of think|ing is embraced by the pea&s;ant, whom the
&s;everi|ty of the laws had annexed to the &s;oil. We now begin to find a
knowledge of the rights of huma|nity diffu&s;ed even to the very lowe&s;t of
the peo|ple, and exerting it&s;elf in rude and terrible efforts for
freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="143"> The pre&s;ent in&s;urrection began in
E&s;&s;ex, where a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, implying, that the
pea&s;ants were doomed to death; that their hou&s;es would be burned, and their
farms plun|dered. The country people, alarmed at this in|telligence, ro&s;e in
their own defence, and, their numbers continually increa&s;ing, they advanced
near London, to the number of an hundred thou|&s;and, with banners di&s;played.
At the head of this undi&s;ciplined concour&s;e was one Walter, by trade a
tyler; he was one of tho&s;e hardy &s;pirits &s;o fre|quently found among the
common Engli&s;h, ready to face any danger, and &s;upport every calamity: in
exacting the poll-tax he had refu&s;ed to pay for his daughter, alledging, that
&s;he was under the age mentioned in the act of parliament. The brutal
collector in&s;i&s;ted upon her being a full grown wo|man, and, in order to
a&s;certain his a&s;&s;ertions, pro|ceeded to acts of indecency; this provoked
the fa|ther to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;truck him dead at one blow with his
hammer: Wat Tyler was there|fore con&s;idered as a champion in the cau&s;e, and
appointed &s;poke&s;man to the people. It is ea&s;y to imagine the di&s;orders
committed by &s;uch a tumul|tuous a&s;&s;embly; they burned and pillaged
where|ever they came, and revenged their former mi&s;eries upon their
ma&s;ters, the gentry, to whom they no longer acknowledged &s;ubjection. After
having entered the Tower, and murdered &s;uch as they re|garded as enemies,
they divided them&s;elves into bodies, and took up their quarters in different
parts of the environs of the city. At length, Richard, riding towards
Smithfield, invited them to a con|ference, in order to know and remove their
griev|ances. Wat Tyler ju&s;t entered Smithfield, when the King's Knight
delivered the royal me&s;&s;age, <PB N="141" REF="144"> without alighting, not
imagining he &s;hould &s;tand upon ceremony: but this haughty demagogue,
who&s;e pride began to ri&s;e with his exaltation, was &s;o offended at this
want of re&s;pect, that he was going to kill him, if the King, who was
him&s;elf advancing, had not ordered him to di&s;mount. In Wat Tyler's
conference with the King, being both on hor&s;eback, he made &s;everal
propo&s;als, which, though cen&s;ured by hi&s;torians as extrava|gant, in
reality breathe nothing but common ju&s;|tice. He de&s;ired that all &s;laves
&s;hould be &s;et free, and that all commonages &s;hould be open to the poor as
well as the rich: whil&s;t he made the&s;e de|mands, he now and then lifted up
his &s;word, in a menacing manner; which in&s;olence &s;o rai&s;ed the
indignation of William Walworth, mayor of Lon|don, who attended the King, that,
without con|&s;idering to what danger he expo&s;ed his ma&s;ter, he &s;tunned
Tyler with a blow of his mace, and Sir Philpot, riding up, thru&s;t his &s;word
through his body: his followers, &s;eeing their leader on the ground,
encouraged each other to revenge his death, and their bows were now bent for
execu|tion, when Richard, though not quite &s;ixteen years of age, in&s;tead of
flying, rode up to the re|bels, with admirable con&s;tancy and pre&s;ence of
mind, crying out with a re&s;olute voice, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>What, my lieges, will you then kill your King?
Be not concerned for the lo&s;s of your leader: I my&s;elf will now be your
general, follow me into the field, and you &s;hall have whatever you
de&s;ire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The rebels immediately de&s;i&s;ted; they followed the King, as if
mechanically; and the next day received a charter of freedom and a general
par|don. But the&s;e were only extorted grants, they were &s;oon retracted, the
ring-leaders of the rebel|lion <PB N="142" REF="145"> were tried, convicted of
trea&s;on, and executed without mercy. The in&s;urrections of the barons
again&s;t their King, hi&s;torians talk of with no great degree of animo&s;ity;
the in&s;urrection of the ple|beians again&s;t the barons, in the pre&s;ent
ca&s;e, is branded with all the virulence of reproach. The puni&s;hment of the
in&s;urgent barons, is generally &s;tyled cruelty; the puni&s;hment of men who
fought for native freedom, is called ju&s;tice; but, we mu&s;t be contented
with &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations of facts, till philo&s;ophers can be found
to write hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee the fir&s;t wrong &s;tep in Richard's conduct. He
granted the rebels a charter, by which he gave the &s;anction of ju&s;tice to
their claims, but &s;oon revoked this charter, which was apparently denying
that ju&s;tice they demanded. By the&s;e means he di&s;&s;ipated, indeed, the
combi|nation for that time, but their hatred remained, and was propagated by
the &s;everity of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>By this means Richard had effectually alienated the affections of
the lower orders of people; it now only remained to make the parliament his
enemies. Being come to his &s;eventeenth year, he began more plainly to
di&s;cover his inclinations, which had hitherto been re&s;trained by the
authority of his governors: he had been bred up amid&s;t flatterers, who never
ventured to controul his will; he had &s;een the liberties taken by Edward III.
over his &s;ubjects, and he fancied he might imitate him in them; but Richard
was not the conqueror of France and Scotland; he was hated by the poor, and
envied by three guardians of great power, who &s;ecretly de&s;ired his crown:
every error, there|fore, in the conduct of a King, &s;o &s;ituated, mu&s;t be
attended with dangerous and violent effects; his indolence in repre&s;&s;ing
the invafions of the <PB N="143" REF="146"> Scotch, and the machinations of
France, were &s;ufficient to give di&s;gu&s;t to his conduct. All his faults
were exaggerated, and his behaviour, even when right, publicly reproved.
Unaccu&s;tomed to controul, he laid a &s;cheme of becoming ab&s;olute, and
governing without his parliament's a&s;&s;i&s;tance or advice. Willing,
however, to colour his ar|bitrary proceeding with the appearance of ju&s;tice,
he a&s;ked the opinion of the Judges: their opinions have been too often found
to be influenced by in|tere&s;t; they gave it as their opinion, that the King
was above law. Yet perhaps they might have been directed by ancient laws, but
cu&s;tom had in|troduced new modes of thinking, and they did not pay a ju&s;t
deference to her power. This &s;entence the Lords oppo&s;ed by declarations,
and, offering various rea&s;ons, were quickly at the head of forty thou&s;and
men to &s;econd their arguments: but, what had &s;till greater weight, they
threatened to chu&s;e a new King, which &s;o operated upon the King's natural
pu&s;illanimity, that he con&s;ented to change his favourite mini&s;ters, who
had advi&s;ed him to extend the royal prerogative; he renewed his
coronation-oath, and the &s;ame formalities were u&s;ed as at the commencement
of a new reign.</P>
<P>We have &s;een numberle&s;s of the&s;e in&s;urrections without any
apparent con&s;equence; the King cir|cum&s;cribed in one reign, and permitted
to range at liberty in another: the only &s;ecret, at that time, for a King to
become de&s;potic, was to be ever in the field; a warlike Prince might command
the nobility, as they were obliged to follow him in his campaigns; and he might
command the people, from that fondne&s;s which the vulgar have for a conqueror.
Richard, however, was no way war|like; but, being bred up in the luxury and
pride <PB N="144" REF="147"> of a court, &s;till expected deference and
obedience, which could, at that time, be obtained only by merit in war.</P>
<P>Having, by the removal of his favourites, ren|dered him&s;elf
&s;till more feeble than before, he now ran into profu&s;ion, and endeavoured
to forget his real weakne&s;s, in extravagance and luxury. Such expences
nece&s;&s;arily created new demands upon the people, and they were bold enough
to refu&s;e: this nece&s;&s;arily produced new in&s;urrections, and reiterated
puni&s;hments on the part of the King. Puni&s;hment and arbitrary proceedings
generally produce but a temporary and fatal &s;ecurity: Richard, however,
in&s;en&s;ible of this, imagined that now was the time to render him&s;elf
de&s;potic, and had even influence &s;ufficient to prevail upon a parlia|ment,
called in the year 1397, to ju&s;tify his pre|ten&s;ions. By this mercile&s;s
&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;everal of the nobility lo&s;t their lives: the Archbi&s;hop
of Can|terbury was bani&s;hed, the Earl of Arundel put to death, and the Earl
of Warwick &s;entenced to quit the kingdom.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;eemed to contribute to &s;upport the King in the
acqui&s;ition of his new created power. The mo&s;t forward to oppo&s;e his
de&s;igns had &s;uf|fered death or bani&s;hment, and they who &s;till
re|mained, were bribed to acquie&s;ce, by pen&s;ions, grants, and places. The
great officers of the crown, the governors of the towns and counties, were all
devoted to his intere&s;t: yet, all this was but a deceitful &s;ecurity; this
was a power founded upon intere&s;t or terror alone, and not up|on affection;
the people hated him, and the gene|rality of the nobles only obeyed him through
con|&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148"> In this manner did this giddy Monarch
&s;uffer him&s;elf to be deluded by vain hopes, and eve|ry day gave &s;ome new
in&s;tance of &s;training the royal prerogative beyond what it could bear: but
&s;oon an opportunity offered to induce the people to refu&s;e a blind
obedience to his unju&s;t commands, and to convince him of his former errors; a
charge happening to be exhibited by the Duke of Hereford again&s;t the Duke of
Norfolk, for having &s;poken &s;editious words again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, in a
private conver&s;ation; for want of &s;ufficient proof to &s;up|port the
accu&s;ation, it was decreed, by the lords in parliament, that the di&s;pute
&s;hould be decided by &s;ingle combat, according to the laws of chival|ry,
&s;till in fa&s;hion. The time and the place were appointed for the determining
this affair, and the combatants met accordingly. It may not be ami&s;s to
de&s;cribe the ceremonies upon that occa&s;ion:</P>
<P>Hereford, the challenger, fir&s;t appeared, on a white cour&s;er,
gaily capari&s;oned, armed at all points, with his drawn &s;word in his hand:
when he approached the li&s;ts, the Mare&s;chal demanded who he was, to which
he an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am Henry of Lanca&s;ter, Duke of Hereford, come
hither, according to my duty, again&s;t Thomas Mow|bray, Duke of Norfolk, a
fal&s;e traitor to God, the King, the realm, and me."</Q> Then, taking the oath
that his quarrel was ju&s;t and true, he de|&s;ired to enter the li&s;ts; which
being granted, he &s;heathed his &s;word, pulled down his beaver, cro&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf on the forehead, &s;eized his lance, pa&s;&s;ed the barrier, alighted
and &s;ate down in a chair of green velvet, placed at one end of the li&s;ts.
He had &s;carce taken his &s;eat, when the King came into the field with great
pomp, attended by the peers the Count of St. Pol, who came from France 
<PB N="146" REF="149"> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee this famous trial; and ten
thou|&s;and men at arms to prevent tumults and di&s;turb|ance. His Maje&s;ty,
being &s;eated in his chair of &s;tate, the King at Arms proclaimed, that none
but &s;uch as were appoined to mar&s;hal the field, &s;hould pre&s;ume to touch
the li&s;ts, upon pain of death. Then another herald proclaimed aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold here Henry of Lanca&s;ter, Duke of Hereford,
who has entered the li&s;ts to perform his devoir again&s;t Thomas Mowbray,
Duke of Norfolk, on pain of being counted fal&s;e and recreant."</Q>The Duke of
Norfolk immediately appeared in arms, mounted upon a barbed hor&s;e, with a
coat of arms of crim&s;on velvet, embroidered with lions of &s;ilver and
mulberry trees; and, having taken his oath before the con&s;table and
mare&s;chal, enter|ed the field, exclaiming aloud, 
<Q REND="inline">"God defend the right."</Q> Alighting from his
hor&s;e, he placed him&s;elf in a chair of crim&s;on velvet, oppo&s;ite to his
antagoni&s;t, at the other end of the li&s;ts: then the Mare&s;chal, having
mea&s;ured their lances, de|livered one to the challenger, and &s;ent a Knight
with the other to the Duke of Norfolk, and pro|clamation was made that they
&s;hould prepare for the combat. They immediately mounted their hor&s;es,
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n clo&s;ed their beavers, fixed
their lances on the re&s;ts; and, the trumpets &s;ounding a charge, the Duke of
Hereford began his career with great violence, but, before he could join his
antagoni&s;t, the King threw down his warder, and the heralds interpo&s;ed.
Richard ordered their lances to be taken away, and bani&s;hed the Duke of
Hereford for ten years, and the Duke of Norfolk for life. Nothing could be a
&s;tronger proof of that unac|countable error, which ever attended this King's
de&s;igns, than this behaviour: the one was con|demned <PB N="147" REF="150">
to exile, without being charged with any offence; and the other, without being
convicted of any crime. The whole kingdom was di&s;plea&s;ed at the
di&s;appointment, and this determination, in tho&s;e ferocious times, even
&s;eemed to argue cow|ardice in the King. The Duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed
with grief and de&s;pondence, at the judgment awarded again&s;t him; he retired
to Ve|nice, where, in a little time, he died of &s;orrow and chagrin. Hereford,
on the contrary, bore his fate with great re&s;ignation, and behaved with
&s;uch re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, when he went to take his leave, that the
King remitted four years of his exile. From this he withdrew to Paris, where he
met with a favourable reception from the French King, and, in all probability,
would have married the only daughter of the Duke of Berry, had not the match
been interrupted by the interpo&s;ition of Richard, who &s;ent the Earl of
Sali&s;bury, as his amba&s;&s;ador, to repre&s;ent Hereford as a per&s;on who
had been guilty of trea&s;onable practices, and to a&s;&s;ure the French court,
that he would never be permitted to return to his own country. The Princes of
the blood, alarmed at this declaration, broke off the match abruptly; and, when
Here|ford expo&s;tulated with them on the &s;ubject, made him acquainted with
their rea&s;ons for retracting the a&s;&s;ent they had already given to his
propo&s;al. Such complicated injuries could not fail to aggra|vate the
re&s;entment of the Duke again&s;t Richard, which he had hitherto concealed;
and the&s;e, pro|bably, fir&s;t turned his thoughts upon acquiring the crown of
England. No man could be better qualified for a project of this nature than the
Duke of Hereford: he was cool, cautious, di&s;cerning, and re&s;olute; he had
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his <PB N="148" REF="151"> courage, both at home
and abroad: he was the idol of the &s;oldiery, and the favourite of the
peo|ple: he was immen&s;ely rich, and, by blood or al|liance, connected with
all the noblemen in Eng|land. The greate&s;t part of the kingdom not on|ly
murmured, but loudly exclaimed again&s;t the &s;entence of bani&s;hment which
had been denounced again&s;t him, and ardently wi&s;hed for an opportu|nity of
doing him ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It was not long before they were gratified in this particular: his
father, the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, dying in February, the bani&s;hed Duke of
Here|ford ought to have &s;ucceeded to his titles and e&s;tate, by virtue of
his hereditary right, as well as of the letters patent which he had obtained,
even after his &s;entence at Coventry. But Richard, notwith|&s;tanding his
former grants, allured by the great|ne&s;s of the prize, by a &s;entence no
le&s;s unju&s;t than avaricious, &s;eized the decea&s;ed Duke's effects and
e&s;tate, and decreed that the &s;on's bani&s;hment &s;hould be perpetual. The
laws and liberties of the peo|ple were now in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate;
there was &s;carce a man in the kingdom able, though all were willing, to
oppo&s;e the arbitrary power u&s;urp|ed by the King. Finding him&s;elf above
all re|&s;traint, he gave him&s;elf up to a &s;oft and effeminate life,
regardle&s;s of the good of the public. His mi|ni&s;ters, not to be behind
their Monarch, gave lit|tle attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;aw, without any
concern, the Engli&s;h nation fall into the utmo&s;t contempt. In this
&s;ituation the people naturally turned their eyes upon the bani&s;hed Duke, as
the only per&s;on from whom they could expect redre&s;s: he was &s;timulated by
private injuries, and had al|liance and intere&s;t to give weight to his
mea&s;ures. <PB N="149" REF="152"> The malecontents only waited for the
ab&s;ence of the King, to put the&s;e mea&s;ures into execution.</P>
<P>For this an occa&s;ion &s;oon offered: the Earl of Marche,
pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, having been appointed the King's Lieutenant in
Ireland, was &s;lain, in a &s;kirmi&s;h, by the native Iri&s;h; and Richard was
&s;o incen&s;ed at this, that, with a nu|merous army, he went over to revenge
his death in per&s;on. The Duke of Lanca&s;ter, (for this was the title which
the Duke of Hereford a&s;&s;umed af|ter his father's death) being informed of
Richard's departure from England, with three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, landed at
Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire, at fir&s;t only pretending that his &s;ole aim was
to obtain ju&s;tice. The Earl of Northumberland, who had long been a
malecontent, and Henry Piercy, his &s;on, &s;ir|named Hot&s;pur, immediately
joined him with &s;ome troops: after this junction, the concour&s;e of people
coming to li&s;t under his banner was &s;o great, that, in a few days, his army
was three&s;core thou&s;and &s;trong; &s;o eager were the nobles and people to
put them&s;elves under the protection of a Prince, who allured them with the
pro&s;pect of freedom.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acting in England, Richard was
in Ireland in perfect &s;ecurity: the contrary winds, which continued to blow
above three weeks, hindered his receiving any news of the rebellion in his
native dominions; but, when he heard of it, he immediately impri&s;oned the
Duke of Lanca&s;ter's brothers, whom he had taken over with him; and re&s;olved
to go immediately in|to England, to fight the enemy. Yet, ever wa|vering in his
re&s;olutions, he was per&s;uaded to &s;tay &s;ome time longer, till he could
prepare &s;hips to tran&s;port all his forces at once. This delay com|pleated
his ruin: his friends in England had a&s;&s;em|bled <PB N="150" REF="153"> an
army of forty thou&s;and men, who, upon finding the King did not return to head
them at the time appointed, di&s;per&s;ed. Richard, however, landed in England,
and &s;oon perceived his unhap|py &s;ituation: he &s;aw him&s;elf in the
mid&s;t of an enraged people, none of whom he could rely on; for&s;aken by
tho&s;e who, in the &s;un-&s;hine of power, contributed to fan his follies.
Thus, not know|ing whom to tru&s;t, or where to turn, he &s;aw no other hopes
of &s;afety, but to throw him&s;elf on the genero&s;ity of his enemy: he
therefore &s;ent him word, that he was ready to &s;ubmit to whatever terms he
thought proper to pre&s;cribe, and that he earne&s;tly de&s;ired a conference.
For this pur|po&s;e the Duke of Lanca&s;ter appointed a ca&s;tle within about
ten miles of Che&s;ter, where he came, next day, with his whole army. Richard,
who the day before had been brought hither alone, de|&s;crying his rival's
approach from the walls, went down to receive him; while the Duke, after &s;ome
ceremony, entered the ca&s;tle in complete armour, only his head was bare in
compliment to the fallen King. The King, approaching, received him with the
&s;alutation of, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Cou&s;in of Lanca&s;ter, you are
welcome:</HI></Q> at which the Duke, bowing three times to the ground, replied
in the&s;e terms, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lord the King, I am come &s;ooner than you
appointed, becau&s;e, your people &s;ay, you have for one and twenty years
governed with rigour and indi&s;cretion, &s;o that they are very ill
&s;atisfied with your conduct; but, if it plea&s;e God, I will help you to
govern them better for the time to come.</HI></Q> To this declaration the King
made no other an|&s;wer, but, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Fair Cou&s;in, &s;ince it plea&s;es you, it
plea&s;es us likewi&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The King was &s;oon taught to feel his wretched &s;ituation; he was
led, triumphantly, through every <PB N="151" REF="154"> town, amid&s;t an
infinite concour&s;e of people, who cur&s;ed him and extolled the Duke. Long
live the good Duke of Lanca&s;ter, our deliverer, was the general cry: but, for
the King, to u&s;e the em|phatic words of the poet, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>None cry'd, God ble&s;s him.</HI></Q> After
the&s;e repeated indignities, he was confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the
Tower, there, if po&s;&s;ible, to undergo &s;till a greater variety of
&s;tudied in&s;o|lence and flagrant contempt. Unhappy Richard, thus humbled,
began to lo&s;e his &s;pirits with his power; nor was there any great &s;hare
of policy required to induce him to re&s;ign his crown. Upon this re&s;ignation
the Duke of Lanca&s;ter founded his &s;tronge&s;t claim; but, willing to
fortify his preten|&s;ions with every appearance of ju&s;tice, the parlia|ment
was &s;oon induced to confirm his claims. The King was &s;olemnly depo&s;ed,
and the Duke of Lan|ca&s;ter elected in his &s;tead, by the title of Henry IV.
Thus began the conte&s;t between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, which,
for &s;everal years after, deluged the kingdom with blood; yet, which
con|tributed, in the end, to give &s;trength and con&s;i&s;t|ency to the
con&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>NUMEROUS formalities are often u&s;ed by Princes, only to cover
impotence or impo&s;|ture. Henry the Fourth, knowing the inju&s;tice of his
title to the crown, was at lea&s;t determined to give his coronation all
po&s;&s;ible &s;olemnity. A peculiar oil was u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, he
affect|ed great devotion, and every action &s;hewed with how much humility he
could be an u&s;urper.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="155"> Notwith&s;tanding the validity of his title,
what|ever pains he took to &s;ecure it, was contravert|ed by &s;ome, and a
con&s;piracy was &s;oon formed to replace Richard on the throne. This was
projected by &s;everal noblemen, and the particu|lars of the &s;cheme were
committed to writing, each being provided with a copy, &s;igned by his
confederates: among other con&s;pirators the Duke of Aumerle was one, and he
had been one of a con&s;ultation, when it was re&s;olved, that the King
&s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated at Oxford, at a tournament; but, when that
opportunity offered, he was mi&s;&s;|ing among the number. It happened, at that
time, he was vi&s;iting his father, the Duke of York, and, &s;itting at dinner,
let fall a paper from his bo&s;om, which his father took up and examined. The
Duke, finding the contents to be a conjuration again&s;t the King's life, flew
with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition to Wind&s;or, to inform his Maje&s;ty of the
plot: the &s;on, gue&s;&s;ing his father's intention, went by a &s;horter way,
and obtained his pardon before his father's arrival, who, &s;oon after com|ing,
produced the paper with the con&s;pirators names. Henry, alarmed at this
intelligence, u&s;ed the mo&s;t vigorous efforts to di&s;pel the ri&s;ing
&s;torm.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators had, by this time, dre&s;&s;ed up one of
Richard's &s;ervants, named Maudlin, in royal robes, giving out, that he was
the depo&s;ed King, who, having e&s;caped from pri&s;on, was come to implore
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;ubjects. Pity is a pa&s;&s;ion for which the
Engli&s;h have ever been re|markable; Maje&s;ty, in di&s;tre&s;s, was
&s;ufficient to excite all their loyalty and compa&s;&s;ion, and they flocked
in great numbers round the con&s;piring leaders. Their army &s;oon became
con&s;iderable, and encamped near Cirence&s;ter, while the leaders 
<PB N="153" REF="156"> took up their head quarters in that city: but they were
&s;o carele&s;s, or unexperienced in war, that they neglected to place proper
guards at the gates and the avenues of the place. This the mayor &s;oon
ob&s;erved, and, a&s;&s;embling four hundred men in the night, he &s;ecured the
gates, &s;o as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls: and
then attacked the chiefs within. The Duke of Surry and Earl of Sali&s;bury, two
of the princi|pal con&s;pirators, were taken, after an ob&s;tinate defence, and
beheaded on the &s;pot, by the mayor's order; while the Duke of Exeter, and
Earl of Glouce&s;ter, two more of the party, e&s;caped over the tops of the
hou&s;es into the camp, with a view to &s;torm the town at the head of their
forces; but they found the tents and baggage abandoned by the &s;oldiers, who,
hearing the noi&s;e and tumult within, had concluded that a party of the King's
army had privately entered, and, from this per|&s;ua&s;ion, fled with the
utmo&s;t precipitation. The two Lords, perceiving it out of their power to
execute their de&s;ign, parted, the better to make their e&s;cape; but they had
the misfortune to be taken, and, &s;hortly after, lo&s;t their heads upon the
&s;caffold.</P>
<P>If we compare the times, which I now at|tempt to give you an idea
of, with tho&s;e of King John, or tho&s;e of &s;ome reigns before him, we
&s;hall find a great change, with re&s;pect to the in|&s;urgent barons. In the
former period they made frequent in&s;urrections, were often taken in open
rebellion, but as frequently pardoned; in the pe|riod now in view, they were
&s;eldom taken with|out &s;uffering the utmo&s;t rigour of the law. This
plainly &s;hews, how much the power of the barons was &s;unk in the cour&s;e of
a couple of centuries. <PB N="154" REF="157"> This revolution of power is,
notwith&s;tanding, na|tural and obvious; as the people began to &s;hare the
government with the nobles, the King was fixed upon as a third per&s;on, to
&s;ecure the ba|lance; and both were contented to make him great, from a
jealou&s;y of each other. Noblemen were therefore now executed, not as petty
Mo|narchs but offending &s;ubjects, and none but Kings were con&s;idered as
exempt from penal laws.</P>
<P>In all probability, the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this enter|prize
ha&s;tened Richard's end. One of tho&s;e a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, that are found in
every court, ready to commit the mo&s;t horrid crimes for reward, came down to
the place of this unfortunate Monarch's confinement, and, with eight other
followers, ru&s;hed into his apartment. The King, concluding their de&s;ign was
to take away his life, re&s;olved to &s;ell it as dearly as he could: he
wre&s;ted a poll-ax from one of the murderers, and &s;oon laid four of the
number dead at his feet; but he was at length overpowered, and &s;truck dead by
the blow of a battle-ax. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-third
year of his age, while com|pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;ufferings and death made more
converts to his family and cau&s;e, than ever his mo&s;t meritorious actions
during life had gained him.</P>
<P>The death of Richard was very &s;ea&s;onable to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.
The King of France had actually rai&s;ed a va&s;t armament, in order to replace
the depo&s;ed Monarch; and &s;o much was Henry ter|rified at his intentions,
that he ordered the Bi&s;hop of Arundel to arm even the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of
his pro|vince. The preparations of France might have contributed to ha&s;ten
the fall of Richard; his death was no &s;ooner known at the French court, than 
<PB N="155" REF="158"> all thoughts of the inva&s;ion were laid a&s;ide, a
truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns, and it
was agreed that Queen I&s;abel, who had been married to Richard, but who&s;e
marriage had never been con&s;ummated, &s;hould return to France, her native
country.</P>
<P>A kingdom, like England, at that time divided in it&s;elf, and
&s;urrounded by enemies on every &s;ide, could not expect a peace of any
continuance; ac|cordingly the Scotch began to give new di&s;tur|bances; and,
when the armies of England were marched northward, in order to oppo&s;e their
in|va&s;ions, the Welch ro&s;e to vindicate their ancient liberties. Owen
Glendour, a name among the people of that country, re&s;pected even to this
day, led them on, and gained &s;everal victories; but his &s;ucce&s;&s;es were
only calculated to procure a tempo|rary triumph, and no la&s;ting advantage.
Whatever honour the Engli&s;h lo&s;t on the &s;ide of Wales they gained on that
of Scotland: the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e times are filled with the petty
victories and defeats on either &s;ide, in the&s;e wars; but, as they neither
&s;erved to alter nor transfer power, they &s;carce de|&s;erve a place in the
chronicles of a kingdom.</P>
<P>While Henry was employed in tho&s;e unavailing campaigns, a more
dangerous &s;trom threatened him from his own &s;ubjects. He claimed the
pri|&s;oners that were taken from the Scotch by the Earl of Northumberland, for
him&s;elf; while the Earl, flu&s;hed with victory, and con&s;idering him&s;elf
as the &s;upporting column of Henry's throne, re&s;ent|ed his demand. A
&s;cheme was laid, in which the Scotch and Welch were to combine their forces,
and a&s;&s;i&s;t Northumberland in elevating Mortimer, as the true heir to the
Engli&s;h throne. As &s;oon, therefore, as the confederates were prepared, the 
<PB N="156" REF="159"> Piercies of Northumberland &s;uddenly appeared in arms
in the North: but, the Earl him&s;elf falling ill, his brother and &s;on
marched with his troops to join the Welch, who were advanced as far as
Shrop&s;hire. Upon the junction of the&s;e two ar|mies, they publi&s;hed a
manife&s;to, which complain|ed of many real grievances, and aggravated others.
Henry, who had received no intelligence of their de&s;igns, was extremely
&s;urprized at the news of this rebellion: but, fortunately, having an army in
readine&s;s, he marched towards Shrew&s;bury to meet the rebels, who were there
encamped. Up|on coming up to them, propo&s;als for a mediation were offered,
and &s;uch favourable terms promi&s;ed, that it was thought it would end in a
reconcilia|tion; but di&s;tru&s;t on both &s;ides &s;oon broke off the treaty,
and the battle &s;oon began. In this Henry obtained a complete victory; and
Hot&s;pur, the Earl of Northumberland's &s;on, &s;o renowned for former
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, was &s;lain. Mean time the Earl of Northumberland, being
recovered, was advanc|ing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the
malecontents, and take upon him the com|mand: but, hearing by the way of his
&s;on's and brother's misfortune, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, not daring to
keep the field with &s;o few forces before a victorious army. The King, to
terminate this trouble&s;ome affair as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, promi&s;ed the
Earl an ab&s;olute pardon, in ca&s;e he obeyed with|out delay, menacing him
with utter ruin, &s;hould he refu&s;e the proffered favour. The Earl, finding
him&s;elf without re&s;ource, cho&s;e rather to throw him&s;elf upon the King's
mercy, than lead a pre|carious and indigent life in exile: he therefore
re|paired to York, and threw him&s;elf at the King's &s;eet, who punctually
performed his promi&s;e. Pro|bably <PB N="157" REF="160"> he thought the
criminal was already &s;uffi|ciently puni&s;hed in the death of his &s;on and
bro|ther.</P>
<P>The extinction of one rebellion only &s;eemed to give ri&s;e to new:
the Archbi&s;hop of York, being di&s;&s;atisfied, and eager to revenge the
King's death, by whom he was promoted, entered into a confe|deracy, with &s;ome
other lords, to dethrone Henry. Northumberland, though pardoned, was again
a|mong the number; they were, however, once more prematurely di&s;covered, and
mo&s;t of the con|&s;pirators died by the hands of the executioner, but
Northumberland had the good fortune to e&s;cape into Scotland.</P>
<P>While the kingdom was thus torn by faction, and threatened with
foreign inva&s;ions, a &s;till more terrible calamity threatened it from the
clergy. Since Wickliffe publi&s;hed his opinions, about the end of the reign of
Edward III, his doctrine was &s;o &s;pread, that the clergy were in continual
appre|hen&s;ions of its prevailing: Henry was now to catch at every
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to &s;trengthen his u&s;urped power; among others,
that of the clergy was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; he therefore ear|ne&s;tly
recommended to his parliament the care of the church's con&s;ervation. How
reluctant &s;oever the hou&s;e of commons might be to pro&s;ecute a &s;ect,
who&s;e only crime was error, the credit of the court, and the cabals of the
clergy, obtained, at length, an act for the burning ob&s;tinate heretics. This
&s;tatute was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, than William Sawfre, a follower of
Wickliffe, was burned alive, by virtue of the King's writ, delivered to the
mayor of London. This was the fir&s;t man in England who &s;uffered death for
the &s;ake of religion; but, the fires once kindled, the clergy would not 
<PB N="158" REF="161"> &s;uffer them &s;oon to be extingui&s;hed; they readily
perceived, that a power of burning their enemies would revive that temporal
power which they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed about three centuries before: in this they
were not mi&s;taken; they again, by this means, renewed their pri&s;tine
authority, but with this dif|ference, that as, in the times of the Saxon
hep|tarchy, their power was founded in the love of the people, in the pre&s;ent
ca&s;e, it had its original whol|ly in their fears.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means Henry &s;urvived all his troubles, and the kingdom
enjoyed tranquility. He had no|thing to fear from France, di&s;tracted by its
own inte&s;tine divi&s;ions: the Welch &s;ued for peace, the regent of Scotland
dreaded a rupture with England, le&s;t Henry &s;hould &s;end home the King of
Scotland, whom he had made his pri&s;oner, and thus terminate the regent's
delegated power. Add to this, the male-contents in England were too
incon&s;iderable to at|tempt any thing further again&s;t the government. During
this calm, the King endeavoured to efface the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;everity,
which his conduct had made upon the people, by affecting a popularity and
regard for the welfare of the &s;ubject; a never fail|ing method to conciliate
the affection of the Eng|li&s;h in favour of their &s;overeign. While he thus
laboured, not without &s;ucce&s;s, to retrieve the re|putation he had lo&s;t,
his &s;on, the Prince of Wales, &s;eemed bent upon incurring public aver&s;ion:
he gave a loo&s;e to all kinds of debauchery, and was &s;urrounded by a crew of
profligate wretches, who made a practice of committing he mo&s;t illegal acts
of violence. The father was extremely mortified at this degeneracy in his
elde&s;t &s;on, who had al|ready exhibited repeated proofs of his valour,
con|duct, and genero&s;ity; virtues which he now &s;eem|ed 
<PB N="159" REF="162"> to renounce; while the &s;plenetic and gloomy trembled
at the pro&s;pect of his &s;ucceeding to the throne. Neverthele&s;s, in the
mid&s;t of the&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es, the noblene&s;s of his heart &s;eemed, at
in|tervals, to emerge from the gulph in which it was plunged: one of his
di&s;&s;olute companions, having been brought to trial for &s;ome
mi&s;demeanor, was condemned, notwith&s;tanding all the intere&s;t he could
make in his favour; and he was &s;o exa&s;perated at the i&s;&s;ue of the
trial, that he &s;truck the Judge up|on the bench. This magi&s;trate, who&s;e
name was Sir William Ga&s;coigne, behaved with the dignity that became his
office; he forthwith ordered the Prince to be committed to pri&s;on: when this
tran&s;|action was reported to the King, who was an ex|cellent judge of
mankind, he could not help ex|claiming, in a tran&s;port of joy, Happy is the
King, who has a magi&s;trate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon
&s;uch an offender; &s;till more happy in having a &s;on willing to &s;ubmit to
&s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>This, in fact, is one of the fir&s;t great in&s;tances we read in
the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, of a magi&s;trate do|ing ju&s;tice in oppo&s;ition to
power. The govern|ment was now much changed from what it was in the times, even
of Richard, where Judges were but the mini&s;ters of royal caprice.</P>
<P>Henry did not long out-live this interview: per|ceiving his end
approach, he di&s;po&s;ed his mind to the duties of devotion, and took the
cro&s;s, fully determined to con&s;ecrate the remaining part of his life in
fighting the cau&s;e of the pilgrims to Jeru&s;alem, which was, at that time,
con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of heaven. This is not the fir&s;t in&s;tance we
have &s;een of Princes endeavouring to &s;trike up a bar|gain with Providence,
and promi&s;ing to perform <PB N="160" REF="163"> particular acts of devotion,
upon being indulged with a longer period of exi&s;tence. He imparted his
de&s;ign to a great council, a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e; and began to
make preparations for the expedition, when his di&s;order encrea&s;ed to &s;uch
a degree, that he was obliged to lay a&s;ide his inten|tion, and think of a
voyage of by far greater importance. As his con&s;titution decayed, his fears
of lo&s;ing the crown redoubled, even to childi&s;h anxiety; he would not
&s;leep, unle&s;s the royal diadem was laid upon his pillow: one day, being in
a violent paroxy&s;m of his di&s;order, the Prince of Wales took up the crown
and carried it away; but, &s;oon after, the King recovering his &s;en&s;es, and
mi&s;&s;ing the crown, he a&s;ked what was be|come of it; and, under&s;tanding
the Prince had car|ried it off, 
<Q REND="inline">"What," &s;aid the King to the Prince, with marks of
indignation, "would you rob me of my dignity before my death?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">No, replied the Prince, "Thinking your Maje&s;ty was
dead, I took the crown as my lawful inheritance; but, now I &s;ee you alive. I
re&s;tore it with much more plea&s;ure, and may God grant you many happy days
to enjoy it in peace."</Q> So &s;aying, he re|placed the crown upon the pillow;
and, having re|ceived his father's ble&s;&s;ing, dutifully retired. The King
was &s;urprized with his la&s;t fit, at his devo|tions before the &s;hrine of
St. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, from whence he was
car|ried to the Jeru&s;alem chamber. When recovered from his &s;woon,
perceiving him&s;elf in a &s;trange place, he de&s;ired to know if the
apartment had any particular name; being told of its appellation, he now
concluded a prophecy fulfilled, which &s;aid, that he &s;hould die in
Jeru&s;alem; and, after &s;ome good in&s;tructions to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, he
recommended <PB N="161" REF="164"> his &s;oul to heaven, and &s;oon after
expired, on the twentieth day of March, in the forty-&s;ixth year of his age,
and the fourteenth of his reign.</P>
<P>Henry, whatever he might have been as a man, was certainly an
excellent King. The govern|ment a&s;&s;umed both a form and liberty under his
admini&s;tration: the di&s;tinction between the nobi|lity and the people was
rendered le&s;s con&s;iderable, and the magi&s;trates were le&s;s arbitrary and
le&s;s venal.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Henry IV. gave his people but little affliction, among
whom he never ac|quired any popularity; but the rejoicings made for the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his &s;on, Henry V, were ma|nife&s;t and &s;incere. This
Prince was their favou|rite, notwith&s;tanding the profligacy of his youth: in
the very height of riot and extravagance, he would, &s;ometimes, give
in&s;tances of the &s;ublime&s;t virtues. But his courage &s;eemed to be what
pe|culiarly won their affection and e&s;teem: at this barbarous period, courage
&s;eemed to be regarded as the only virtue; courage and &s;uper&s;tition then
made up the whole &s;y&s;tem of human duty, and &s;tamped the character of
heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>The people of Europe were, by this time, de|generated from what they
were even two hundred years before; a continuance of war had blotted out the
very traces of morality. The vices of the clergy had drawn upon them contempt
and oppo|&s;ition, which they returned, not by refo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ming them&s;elves, but by per&s;ecuting
tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed <PB N="162" REF="165"> them. This reign was begun in
attempting to extirpate the here&s;y of Wickliffe: John Oldca&s;tle, baron of
Cobham, was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable pro|tector of this &s;ect; he was the
King's dome&s;tic, and &s;tood highly in his favour. The Archbi&s;hop of
Canterbury, therefore, undertook to prejudice him in the royal opinion, and
endeavoured to per|&s;uade the young Monarch, that fire and faggot were the
only in&s;truments that were capable of &s;aving an heretic from future
damnation; and that Oldca&s;tle's opinions de&s;erved the &s;evere&s;t
puni&s;h|ments of the law. The King was, at length, per|&s;uaded to talk with
Oldca&s;tle in private, and, find|ing him immoveable, gave him up to the fury
of his enemies. Per&s;ecution ever produces tho&s;e crimes which it endeavours
to aboli&s;h; Oldca&s;tle was condemned, but, e&s;caping, was obliged to
become, in fact, that guilty per&s;on which they had at fir&s;t fal&s;ly
repre&s;ented him: he headed a body of malecontents, and refu&s;ed to be
demeanable to royal power. This unhappy man, after a variety of
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, at length fell into the power of his enemies; and never did
the cruelty of man in|vent, or the crimes of the delinquent draw down, more
torments than he was made to endure: he was hung up with a chain by the middle,
and, by a &s;low fire, burned, or, rather, roa&s;ted alive.</P>
<P>Such &s;pectacles as the&s;e, mu&s;t naturally produce a di&s;gu&s;t
in the people, both to the government and the clergy; but, to turn their minds
from the&s;e hideous &s;pectacles, Henry was re&s;olved to take ad|vantage of
the troubles in which France was, at that time, involved. Charles, who was then
King of France, was &s;ubject to frequent fits of lunacy, which totally
di&s;qualified him from reign|ing: in the&s;e intervals the ambition of his
va&s;&s;als <PB N="163" REF="166"> and courtiers had room for exertion, and
they grew powerful from the weakne&s;s of their King. I&s;a|bella, of Bavaria,
his wife, was at the head of one faction; the Duke of Burgundy of another: the
faction of the children of the Duke of Orleans was con&s;iderable; that only,
which held by the King, was feeble. Each of the&s;e, as they hap|pened to
prevail, branded their captives with the names of traitors, and the gibbets
were at once hung with the bodies of the accu&s;ed and the ac|cu&s;ers.</P>
<P>This was thought a mo&s;t favourable opportuni|ty to re&s;cue, from
France, tho&s;e grants that had formerly been given up by treaty: Henry,
there|fore, invaded that kingdom, with an army of fifty thou&s;and men. He took
Harfleur, and advanced into a country already rendered de&s;olate by factions,
and which he now totally laid wa&s;te by a foreign in|va&s;ion: but, tho' the
enemy made but a feeble re&s;i&s;t|ance, yet the climate &s;eemed to fight for
them, a contagious dy&s;entery carried off three parts of Hen|ry's &s;oldiers.
In &s;uch a &s;ituation, he had recour&s;e to an expedient common enough in the
barbarous times I am de&s;cribing; he challenged the Dauphin to &s;ingle
combat, offering to &s;take his preten&s;ions on the event; this challenge, as
might naturally be expected, was rejected; and the French, tho' di&s;agreeing
internally, now &s;eemed to unite at the appearance of foreign danger.</P>
<P>Henry &s;oon began to repent of his ra&s;h inroad into a country,
where di&s;ea&s;e, and a powerful ar|my, every moment threatened de&s;truction;
and, therefore, thought of retiring to Calais. In this retreat, which was at
once both painful and dan|gerous, Henry took every method to in&s;pire his
troops with courage and per&s;everance, and &s;hewed <PB N="164" REF="167">
them, in him&s;elf, an example of patience and re|&s;ignation. In the mean time
the French army was drawn up to ob&s;truct his pa&s;&s;age, nor was there any
po&s;&s;ibility of his pa&s;&s;ing them without a bat|tle; yet, even that could
promi&s;e but &s;mall hopes of victory: his army was wa&s;ted with di&s;ea&s;e,
their &s;pirits worn down with fatigue, de&s;titute of provi|&s;ions, and but
nine thou&s;and in number, to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of an enemy amounting to
an hundred and fifty thou&s;and. This di&s;parity, as it rai&s;ed the courage
of the French, &s;o it impre&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h with terror. So confident
were the French leaders of &s;ucce&s;s, that they began to treat for the
ran&s;om of their pri&s;oners: on the 25th of October, 1415, the two armies
drew up in battle array, early in the morning, near the ca&s;tle of Agincourt.
A narrow ground, flanked on one &s;ide by a wood, on the other by a rivulet,
was to be the &s;cene of action. The Con&s;table of France commanded the
French, and Henry, with Edward, Duke of York, the Engli&s;h: both armies, for
&s;ome time, kept &s;i|lently gazing at each other, as if afraid to begin;
which Henry perceiving, with a chearful counte|nance cried out, My friends,
&s;ince they will not begin, let us &s;et them the example; come on, and the
ble&s;&s;ed Trinity be our protection: and now the whole army &s;et forward
with a &s;hout. The French &s;till continued to wait their approach with
intrepi|dity, when the Engli&s;h archers let fly a &s;hower of arrows, three
feet long, which did great execu|tion: the French cavalry, advancing to repel
the&s;e two hundred bow-men, who lay till then conceal|ed, ri&s;ing on a
&s;udden, let fly among them: the Engli&s;h, &s;eeing their confu&s;ion, now
threw by their arrows, and &s;ell upon them &s;word in hand; tho' feeble by
di&s;ea&s;e, yet they recompen&s;ed the defect <PB N="165" REF="168"> by
valour. The French at fir&s;t repul&s;ed the a&s;|&s;ailants, but they,
re&s;olving to conquer or die, again bur&s;t in upon the enemy, with &s;uch
impe|tuo&s;ity, that they gave way: in the mean time, a body of Engli&s;h
hor&s;e, which had been concealed in a neighbouring wood, ru&s;hing out,
flanked the French infantry; and now a total di&s;order began to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t line of the enemy being thus routed, the &s;econd line
began to march up to interrupt the progre&s;s of victory. Henry, therefore,
alighting from his hor&s;e, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the enemy, with an
undaunted countenance; and, at the head of his men, fought on foot, encouraging
&s;ome, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting others. Eighteen French cavaliers, who were
re&s;olv|ed to kill him or to die in the attempt, ru&s;hing forth together,
advanced, and one of them &s;tunned him with a blow of his battle-ax; they then
fell upon him in a body, and he was ju&s;t going to &s;ink un|der their blows,
when David Gam, a valiant Welchman, and two more of the &s;ame country, came to
his aid: they &s;oon turned the attention of the French from the King; but,
being over-powered them&s;elves, they fell dead at his feet. The King had now
recovered his &s;en&s;es, and, more help coming in, the eighteen Frenchmen were
all &s;lain; upon which he knighted the brave Welchmen, who had valiantly
fallen in his de|fence. The heat of the battle &s;till encrea&s;ing, his
courage &s;eemed to encrea&s;e; and, now, the thicke&s;t of the battle was
gathered round his per&s;on: his brother, being fallen down by his &s;ide,
&s;tunned with the blow of a club, he covered him for a while; but, receiving
another blow him&s;elf, it threw him on his knees: he &s;oon, however,
re|covered, <PB N="166" REF="169"> and his valour &s;eemed to in&s;pire his
troops with fury; they ran headlong upon the enemy, and, by an unexpected
attack, put them into &s;uch di&s;or|der, that their leaders could never after
bring them to the charge. The Duke of Alencon, who com|manded the &s;econd
line, &s;eeing it fly, re&s;olved, by one de&s;perate &s;tep, to retrieve the
day, or fall in the attempt: wherefore, running up to King Henry, and crying
aloud that he was the Duke of Alencon, he di&s;charged &s;uch a blow on his
head, that it carried off a part of the King's helmet; Henry, not having been
able to ward off the blow, &s;oon returned it, by &s;triking the Duke to the
ground; and he was &s;oon killed by the &s;urrounding crowd, all the King's
efforts to &s;ave him from their fury being ineffectual.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t lines being thus di&s;per&s;ed, the third refu&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and marched off with|out fighting. The King, therefore,
thinking him|&s;elf thus &s;ure of victory, was &s;urprized with an account
that his baggage was plundering by the enemy: ju&s;t &s;truck with an
apprehen&s;ion that the French had rallied, and being &s;en&s;ible that the
number of his pri&s;oners was greater than that of his army, he ra&s;hly
ordered all the pri&s;oners to be put to death; which order was accordingly
exe|cuted. This &s;everity tarni&s;hed the glory which his victory would
otherwi&s;e have acquired: but all the heroi&s;m, and all the virtues of that
age, are tinctured with barbarity.</P>
<P>This victory, however great it may appear, was rather o&s;tentatious
than u&s;eful: it acquired the Engli&s;h glory, but not dominion; and while it
&s;et|tled Henry's intere&s;t more firmly in the hearts of his &s;ubjects, it
only &s;erved to in&s;pire him with a love of new conque&s;ts. With this view,
therefore, he <PB N="167" REF="170"> returned to England, in order to procure
new &s;tores of men and money.</P>
<P>The war between the two kingdoms, from this period, &s;eemed to be
carried on rather by negotia|tions, trea&s;ons, plots, and fomented
jealou&s;ies, than by the force of arms. France was but as one va&s;t theatre
of crimes, murders, puni&s;hments, and deva&s;tation: the Duke of Orleans was
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the Duke of Burgundy, and he, in his turn, fell by the
treachery of the Dauphin; while the &s;on, de&s;iring to revenge his father's
death, acknow|ledged Henry as lawful heir to the crown, and a treaty was
concluded between Henry and the young Duke of Burgundy at Troyes, by which he
was acknowledged heir to the crown of France, after the death of Charles, who
&s;till reigned, though, by his di&s;ea&s;es, rendered totally incapable of
bu|&s;ine&s;s. Catharine, the French King's daughter, was given to Henry in
marriage: and it was re|&s;olved, that the Dauphin &s;hould be brought to an
account for the murder of the late Duke of Bur|gundy. Things being adju&s;ted
in this manner, Henry entered the city of Paris without oppo&s;ition, and there
conducted the government at his plea|&s;ure; while the feeble Charles was
attended as a King indeed, but with &s;carce even the liberty of a
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Dauphin, in the mean time, wandered about, a &s;tranger in his
own dominions, while Henry returned to London, to rai&s;e new &s;ub&s;idies and
new troops, to &s;ecure his late conque&s;ts. His pre&s;ence, as might be
expected, in&s;pired his &s;ub|jects with joy, but they, at the &s;ame time,
could not be much plea&s;ed with a conque&s;t, which &s;eem|ed likely to
transfer the &s;eat of empire from among them. The parliament, upon various
pretences, <PB N="168" REF="171"> refu&s;ed him a &s;upply equal to his
demands: how|ever, he again &s;et &s;ail with a new-rai&s;ed army, and the
Dauphin, upon his appearance, thought fit a|gain to retire. Henry then enters
Paris, and, while Charles had but a &s;mall court, he was at|tended with a very
magnificent one. On Whit|&s;unday they dined together in public, the two Kings
and the two Queens, with their crowns on their heads; Charles, indeed,
receiving apparent homage, but Henry commanding with ab&s;olute authority.
After this he prepared to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s of the enemy, who had already
taken &s;ome towns; but, whil&s;t he flattered him&s;elf with a &s;peedy
victory, he was attacked with a fi&s;tula, which the phy&s;icians were, at that
time, too un&s;kilful to treat with judgment. He died at the ca&s;tle of
Vincennes, with the &s;ame intrepidity with which he lived, and was buried at
We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. His reign, during the &s;hort time he lived, which was
but thirty-four years, was rather &s;plendid than &s;erviceable; the
trea&s;ures of his native country were lavi&s;hed upon conque&s;ts, that to
them were unprofitable. His military fame acquired him the reputation of every
other good quality; he favour|ed the clergy, and they have returned the debt to
his memory: in general, the good or the erroneous conduct of a Prince appears
rather after his death than during his life-time; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of
imprudent Kings are often taxed with errors not their own, as we &s;hall
pre&s;ently &s;ee. He died, however, fortunate, by falling in the mid&s;t of
his triumphs, and leaving his &s;ubjects happy. Charles, who died two months
after him, fini&s;hed a wretch|ed reign, long pa&s;t in phrenzy, and by all
France branded with contempt, leaving the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ubjects upon
earth.</P>

<P>OUR triumphs, at this time, in France, pro|duced &s;carce any good
effects at home; as we grew warlike, we became brutal; and, pant|ing after
foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, we forgot the arts of cultivating tho&s;e that lay
nearer home. Our lan|guage, in&s;tead of improving, was daily becoming more
barbarous: Langland and Chaucer, about a century before, &s;eemed to have drawn
it from ob|&s;curity, and enriched it with new terms and combi|nations; but it
was now relap&s;ed into its former gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, and no poet or hi&s;torian
of note was born in this calamitous period.</P>
<P>Henry VI, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Henry V, was not quite a year old when
he came to the throne; and his rela|tions began, &s;oon after, to di&s;pute the
government during his minority. The Duke of Bedford was ap|pointed, by
parliament, Protector of England, De|fender of the Church, and Fir&s;t
Coun&s;ellor of the King: his brother, the Duke of Glouce&s;ter, was to govern
in his ab&s;ence, while he conducted the French war; but &s;everal others
a&s;pired at this po&s;t as well as he. The &s;econd rank in every kingdom, as
being the mo&s;t powerful, is generally the mo&s;t envied &s;ituation: the
fir&s;t &s;tep his enemies took to render the Duke of Glouce&s;ter odious, was
to accu&s;e his wife, the Duche&s;s, of witchcraft. She was charged with
conver&s;ing with one Sir Roger Bo|lingbroke, a prie&s;t and reputed
necromancer, and one Mary Gurdemain, who was &s;aid to be a witch: it was
a&s;&s;erted, that, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he made a figure of the
King in wax; this the ac|cu&s;ers &s;aid was placed before a gentle fire, and,
as the wax di&s;&s;olved, the King's &s;trength was <PB N="170" REF="173">
wa&s;ted; and, upon its total di&s;&s;olution, his life would be at an end.
This charge Bolingbroke utterly denied; but the Duche&s;s confe&s;&s;ed that
&s;he had de&s;ired the woman to make her a philtre, to &s;ecure the affections
of the Duke her hu&s;band. Neither their innocence, nor her rank, could
pro|tect them: &s;he was condemned to penance and perpetual impri&s;onment,
Bolingbroke was hanged, and the woman burnt in Smithfield.</P>
<P>Henry, during the&s;e conte&s;ts of his mini&s;ters, was, at
fir&s;t, from age, incapable of conducting the reins of government; and, when
he became adult, he was equally incapable, from ignorance and imbecillity.
Whether it was that his gover|nors had kept him in ignorance, in order to
pro|long their own power, or whether he was natu|rally weak, hi&s;tory does not
clearly determine. The Earl of Suffolk, one of tho&s;e who &s;hared the power
at that time, thought the be&s;t way of ma|naging the King would be to marry
him to a wo|man who was her&s;elf capable of reigning alone. He had &s;till
another motive, which was to create a new power to oppo&s;e the Duke of
Glouce&s;ter, who was his enemy, and an ob&s;tacle in the road to his ambition:
to this purpo&s;e, he fixed upon Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Rene, King of
Sicily, and niece of the King of France. She was a Prince&s;s of uncommon
re&s;olution, and great penetration, but entirely without fortune; for which,
it was &s;aid, her other good qualities were &s;ufficient to atone. This match
the Duke of Glou|ce&s;ter vainly oppo&s;ed; the match went forward, and the new
Queen &s;hewed her re&s;entment, by proving her&s;elf a formidable enemy,
willing and able to undo him.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="174"> She fir&s;t began her reign, therefore, with
re|moving him from the council-board. To palliate this proceeding, per&s;ons
were &s;uborned to accu&s;e him of cruelty and inju&s;tice: to the&s;e
accu&s;ations he pleaded his innocence, with &s;uch force of evi|dence, that
the council, though con&s;i&s;ting of his enemies, were obliged to acquit him.
Still, how|ever, the Queen, bent upon his ruin, ordered him to be apprehended,
and accu&s;ed before the parlia|ment, &s;ummoned for this purpo&s;e. As the
people thought him innocent, it was expected he would come off now as he had
before; but, on the day he was to make his defence, he was found dead in his
bed, though without any &s;igns of vio|lence upon his body.</P>
<P>This violence rendered the Queen and the King equally odious; the
Queen e&s;pecially was charged with the murder, and the dignity of her
&s;tation only &s;erved to render her a more con&s;picuous ob|ject of reproach.
But what &s;till contributed to render the people di&s;contented with the
admini|&s;tration, was the indifferent &s;ucce&s;s of their arms in France.
Triumphs and conque&s;ts were ever a means of repre&s;&s;ing the di&s;contents
of the people; but the pre&s;ent government, to their quarrels at home, added
the misfortune of being defeated a|broad.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Henry V, the Dauphin of France a&s;&s;erted his
claim to the throne of that kingdom, under the title of Charles VII. Nothing
could be more deplorable than his &s;ituation, upon coming to the crown, of
which he was only the nominal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: the Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters
of almo&s;t all France. Henry VI. was &s;olemnly in|ve&s;ted with regal power,
by legates from Paris. The Duke of Bedford, with a numerous army 
<PB N="172" REF="175"> in the heart of the kingdom, confirmed his claim, and
the Duke of Burgundy was &s;teady in the Engli&s;h alliance. Wherever Charles
attempted to face the enemy, he was overthrown; he could &s;carcely rely on the
friends next his per&s;on, and his authority was in&s;ulted, even by his own
&s;er|vants. In this &s;ituation, nothing but miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or
pretended miracles, could &s;ave him. To the la&s;t expedient he had
recour&s;e, and it fully an&s;wered his intentions: the French, from a
van|qui&s;hed nation, are &s;uddenly going to be victo|rious; and the
Engli&s;h, who had been hitherto deemed invincible,, are going to be
every-where wor&s;ted, and, at length, totally driven out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>A gentleman, on the frontiers of Lorrain, who&s;e name was
Baudricourt, was the per&s;on who fir&s;t re&s;olved to put this happy
impo&s;ture into practice. He fixed upon the &s;ervant-maid of an inn for this
purpo&s;e, and &s;he was in&s;tructed at once to perform the duties of a
warrior and a prophete&s;s: this was Joan of Arc, the renowned maid of Orleans;
a woman of ma&s;culine &s;trength and courage, pre|tending to be but eighteen,
but, in reality, twen|ty-&s;even years old. She equipped her&s;elf in the arms
and habit of a man, and it was given out, that &s;he was in&s;pired: &s;he was
brought before the King, examined by the Doctors of the Univer&s;ity, and they,
either deceived, or willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t the impo&s;ture, affirmed that her
commi&s;&s;ion was from heaven. The vulgar, as ready to give credit to
in&s;piration as to witchcraft, ea&s;ily came into the impo&s;ture, and
acquired new hopes and confidence of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h were, at that time, be&s;ieging the city of Orleans,
Charles's la&s;t re&s;ource; and were <PB N="173" REF="176"> upon the point of
becoming ma&s;ters of it: Joan undertook to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and, to render
her&s;elf the more remarkable, ordered a &s;word to be brought her, from the
tomb of a Knight buried in the church of Fierbois. She addre&s;&s;ed the
&s;oldiers as a me&s;&s;enger from heaven, and a&s;&s;ured them, that
providence would &s;trengthen their arms. She march|ed at their head, and
delivered Orleans; routed the Engli&s;h wherever they oppo&s;ed; prophe&s;ied
that the King &s;hould be crowned at Rheims, and &s;he her&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted
at the &s;olemnity which &s;he had fore|told. She was pre&s;ent at the
coronation, holding in her hand the &s;tandard under which &s;he had been &s;o
often victorious.</P>
<P>This chain of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and the dignity which his late
coronation gave the French King, now entirely turned the &s;cale in his favour;
the Eng|li&s;h lo&s;t the kingdom by the &s;ame methods the French had lo&s;t
it before. While Charles united his forces and proceeded with di&s;patch, they
were quarrelling among them&s;elves, and lo&s;ing the &s;ea|&s;ons for
&s;ucce&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the King's good fortune, however, Joan of Arc,
his brave cham|pion, was taken pri&s;oner, as &s;he was protecting the rear of
her men in a retreat. The joy of the Engli&s;h, upon this occa&s;ion, is not to
be expre&s;&s;ed; and the Duke of Bedford, their General, thought no method
could be &s;o proper to re&s;tore their lo&s;t courage, as to pro&s;ecute his
pri&s;oner for witchcraft. It is a di&s;agreeable reflection upon human nature,
that Judges almo&s;t ever determine on the &s;ide of authority: &s;he was found
guilty by &s;everal Bi&s;hops and the Doctors of the univer&s;ity of Paris. She
was at fir&s;t condemned as a &s;orcere&s;s and an he|retic, and enjoined to
live, by way of penance, upon bread and water, and to remain in pri&s;on 
<PB N="174" REF="177"> for life. Some time after, under colour of her
re|lap&s;ing, &s;he was publicly burnt for a witch. Su|per&s;tition adds
virulence to the natural cruelty of mankind, and this cruel &s;entence &s;erved
only to inflame the hatred between the contending powers, without mending the
cau&s;e of the Engli&s;h. In vain the brave Talbot and his &s;on &s;trove to
main|tain the declining intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h in France: in the year
1437, the French King made his tri|umphant entry into Paris, and, in a &s;equel
of thir|teen years more, the Engli&s;h were entirely bani&s;h|ed from France.
They only were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais and Guienne, and lo&s;t for
ever all the fruits of the victories of Cre&s;&s;y, Poictiers, and Agincourt.
Such is the end of ambition: the on|ly con&s;equences of their conque&s;ts
there were to deluge that kingdom with the blood of its &s;laugh|tered
inhabitants, and their own.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the lo&s;&s;es of the
Engli&s;h in France, and the divi&s;ions of their rulers at home, mu&s;t
rai&s;e factions. In this period of calamity, a new intere&s;t was revived,
which &s;eem|ed to have lain dormant in the times of pro&s;perity and triumph:
the Duke of York began to think of a&s;&s;erting his right to the crown. This
noble|man was de&s;cended, by the mother's &s;ide, from Lionel, one of the
&s;ons of Edward III. The reign|ing King was de&s;cended from John of Ghaunt, a
&s;on of the &s;ame Edward, but younger than Lionel; thus the Duke of York's
claim was prior to that of Henry. The en&s;ign of the Duke was a white ro&s;e,
that of Henry a red. This gave name to the two hou&s;es, who&s;e contentions
were now about to drench the kingdom with &s;laughter.</P>
<P>The Duke of Suffolk and the Queen were now at the head of affairs,
and managed all things with <PB N="175" REF="178"> unlimited authority. As he
had made his way to power by the blood of Glouce&s;ter, he was re&s;olv|ed to
e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf by the u&s;ual re&s;ources of tyranny, by cruelty to
his inferiors, and flattery to the Queen. This unju&s;t and ill-managed power
fir&s;t drew again&s;t him the oppo&s;ition of the Duke of York: perhaps the
cau&s;e of the public was the only motive for his fir&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.
Almo&s;t every malecontent has &s;ome real, and &s;ome fictitious cau&s;es of
complaint: he therefore had recour&s;e to parliament, and accu&s;ed the Duke of
Suffolk as the &s;ource of all the nation's di&s;graces in France. This
accu&s;ation might have been fal&s;e, but the real motive, which was Suffolk's
power, and the cruel u&s;e he made of it, was left unmentioned, although it was
true<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The court, to content the
people, condemned him to bani&s;hment, and he embarked in a little ve&s;&s;el
to take his pa&s;&s;age to France; but he could not e&s;cape his de&s;tiny. He
was met in his pa&s;&s;age by an Engli&s;h man of war; the Captain, having a
mind to &s;earch the &s;hip the Duke was in, and finding him there, ordered his
head to be &s;truck off without further delay. There is little in the
tran&s;actions of the&s;e times to inte|re&s;t us on the &s;ide of either
party: we &s;ee crimes continually to di&s;gu&s;t us, and &s;carce a &s;hining
cha|racter or a virtue to animate the narrative.</P>
<P>By the death of the Duke of Suffolk, his rival, of York, &s;aw
him&s;elf rid of a potent enemy, and found the di&s;contents of the people
again&s;t the ad|mini&s;tration daily increa&s;e. Among the in&s;urrections of
the&s;e unhappy times, was that headed by Jack Cade, who led a tumultuous body
of forces to London, to redre&s;s their grievances, and there beheaded the Lord
Trea&s;urer. The government might readily per|ceive the di&s;affection of the
populace, by his reception <PB N="176" REF="179"> from the city of London, who
opened their gates to him: however, upon the King's proclamation, his
adherents, after a day or two, were di&s;per&s;ed, and he him&s;elf taken and
&s;lain. In the mean time the Duke of York &s;ecretly fomented the&s;e
di&s;turbances, and, pretending to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the people, from
his retreat in Wales wrote to the King, ad|vi&s;ing a reformation in the
mini&s;try. His letters of coun&s;el were &s;oon backed by an army; he march|ed
up to London, but found an unexpected re|pul&s;e from the city, which &s;hut
its gates upon him. In this dilemma he offered to di&s;band his army, if the
Duke of Somer&s;et, who was at that time the envied object in power, &s;hould
be &s;ent to the Tower: this reque&s;t was complied with, contrary to his
expectation; and now, coming to court to accu&s;e him in per&s;on, he was
&s;urprized to &s;ee the Duke of Somer&s;et, who was hid behind the hang|ings,
&s;uddenly coming forth, and retorting the accu&s;ation upon him. York now
perceived his danger, and repre&s;&s;ed the impetuo&s;ity of his accu|&s;ation.
As &s;oon as he left the pre&s;ence, the King commanded him to be apprehended;
but &s;uch was the Duke's authority, or &s;uch the timidity of the King's
council, that they &s;uffered him to re|tire, upon promi&s;ing &s;trict
obedience for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>This reconciliation was only temporary; he &s;till a&s;pired at the
crown, and, the King falling ill, by his intrigues he had &s;ufficient art to
be taken into the number of the privy council. This was a fa|tal blow to
Henry's intere&s;ts: the Duke of York, now let into a &s;hare of the authority,
and &s;ecure of the affections of the people, carried all before him. The Duke
of Somer&s;et was &s;ent to the Tower, and the parliament declared his rival
Pro|tector <PB N="177" REF="180"> of the realm. This power the Duke of York,
for &s;ome time, enjoyed without controul; till the unhappy King, recovering
from his dizzi|ne&s;s, as if awaking from a dream, perceived, with &s;urprize,
that he was &s;tripped of his autho|rity. Margaret, his Queen, did all in her
power to rouze him to a &s;en&s;e of his &s;ituation: he there|fore began by
depo&s;ing the Duke from his power, who in&s;tantly had recour&s;e to arms. The
impo|tent Monarch, thus obliged to take the field, was dragged after his army
to the battle of St. Alban's, where he was routed by the Duke of York, and
Somer&s;et, his General, was flain. The King, being wounded, and hiding
him&s;elf in a cottage near the field of battle, was taken pri&s;oner, and
treated with &s;eeming re&s;pect: from thence he was brought along, in triumph,
to London; and the Duke permitting him &s;till to enjoy the title of King,
re&s;erved to him&s;elf that of Protector, in which con&s;i&s;ted all the power
of the crown.</P>
<P>Henry was now but a pri&s;oner, treated with the forms of royalty;
yet, indolent and &s;ickly as he was, the title alone &s;eemed &s;ufficient for
him. At la&s;t his friends induced him once more to re-a&s;&s;ert his
prerogative: the Duke of York again retired, to re&s;i&s;t the de&s;igns of the
Queen. Mutual di&s;|tru&s;t once more brought their armies to the field, and
the fate of the kingdom was to be decided by the &s;word. On the King's &s;ide,
the Queen &s;eem|ed the only acting General: &s;he ranged the army in battalia,
gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders, while the poor King w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s led about, from place to place, an involuntary
&s;pectator of tho&s;e martial preparations. The army on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide
was, in the ab&s;ence of the Duke of York, commanded by the Earl of Warwick,
the mo&s;t celebrated General of his <PB N="178" REF="181"> age: a man formed
for times of trouble, extreme|ly artful, and extremely brave; equally &s;kilful
in council and the field, and born to give and to take away kingdoms at
plea&s;ure. After many battles without effect, and de&s;igns without
con&s;equence, both armies, at la&s;t, met on a plain near Nor|thampton: the
Queen's army con&s;i&s;ted of five and twenty thou&s;and men, the army of
Warwick of forty thou&s;and. Never was greater animo&s;ity be|tween the chiefs
of an army before; both pretend|ing to fight for the King, who&s;e authority
they equally attempted to de&s;troy. While the Queen went about from rank to
rank, the King &s;taid in his tent, waiting the i&s;&s;ue of the battle with
fe|male doubts and apprehen&s;ions: both &s;ides fought five hours with the
utmo&s;t ob&s;tinacy, but the good fortune of the Earl of Warwick was
&s;uperior to that of the Queen; &s;he was conquered, and had the misfortune to
&s;ee the King taken pri&s;oner in his tent. Thus Henry was once more brought
back, in triumph, to his capital.</P>
<P>A parliament was now called to give a face to this &s;ucce&s;sful
rebellion. The Duke of York, though formerly contented with the title of
Pro|tector, now claimed the crown. Our pro&s;pects wi|den as we ri&s;e: the
cau&s;e of Henry and the Duke was &s;olemnly debated in the Hou&s;e of Peers:
each &s;ide produced their rea&s;ons for or again&s;t the con|queror. This was
the fir&s;t time that a true &s;pirit of liberty ever appeared to exert
it&s;elf in England, and in which victory did not determine every in|quiry. The
Duke of York, though a conqueror, could not entirely gain his cau&s;e: it was
deter|mined that Henry &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne during life, and that
the Duke of York &s;hould be his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, to the utter &s;eclu&s;ion
of the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="182"> The Queen, to all appearance, &s;eemed now
ut|terly de&s;titute of every re&s;ource: but, though &s;he had lo&s;t all,
&s;he yet retained her native per&s;eve|rance and intrepidity. She was a woman
of a great mind, and &s;ome faults; but ambition &s;eemed to be what called
them into action. Being now a fu|gitive, di&s;tant from the capital, oppo&s;ed
by a vic|torious army, and a con&s;ummate General, &s;he &s;till tried every
re&s;ource to repair her di&s;a&s;trous cir|cum&s;tances: &s;he flew to Wales,
animated her old friends, acquired new, and rai&s;ed an army to de|fend her
cau&s;e. She, and her old enemy, the Duke of York, once more met upon Wakefield
Green, near the ca&s;tle of Sandal: fortune this day turned the victory on her
&s;ide; the Duke of York was &s;lain; the Duke of Rutland, his &s;e|cond &s;on,
fell in the flight; and the father's head, being cut off, was fixed upon the
walls of York.</P>
<P>Margaret, being now victorious, marched to|wards London, in order to
give the King his li|berty. The Earl of Warwick, who now was at the head of the
Yorki&s;ts, &s;till commanded an ar|my, in which he led about the captive King
to give a &s;anction to his attempts. Another battle was to drench the kingdom
with the blood of its inhabitants: the Queen and the Earl met near St. Alban's,
where the Queen was now again victo|rious; &s;he had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee
the General, by whom &s;he was once defeated, now fly in his turn; and, what
added to her glory, &s;he had the fortune to relea&s;e the King, her hu&s;band,
from his capti|vity. Her triumph was great, though contami|nated with cruelty;
but it was of &s;hort continu|ance. The city of London was to be gained, but
Warwick had already &s;ecured it in his intere&s;ts: the citizens al&s;o feared
her tumultuous army, and <PB N="180" REF="183"> refu&s;ed to open their gates
upon her &s;ummons. In the mean time, Warwick a&s;&s;embled the people in St.
John's fields, and, &s;hewing them the &s;on of the late Duke of York,
demanded, Whether they cho&s;e to have him or Henry for their King? Upon which,
the people crying out a York, an a&s;&s;embly was quickly called, and the young
Duke, being pre&s;ent, they elected him King, by the name of Edward IV, and
conducted him, with great cere|mony, to the palace where Henry u&s;ed to lodge
when within the walls of the city.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Queen Margaret collected a great army in the
North, amounting to &s;ixty thou|&s;and men at arms. She was now to &s;trike
her &s;tronge&s;t blow: the command of this army was given to a per&s;on who
acted under her directions. On the other &s;ide Warwick conducted young
Ed|ward, at the head of forty thou&s;and men, to oppo&s;e her. Both &s;ides, at
length, met near Santon in the county of York: never was England depopulated by
&s;o terrible a day. What a dreadful &s;ight to be|hold almo&s;t an hundred
thou&s;and men, of the &s;ame country, fighting to &s;atisfy the empty ambition
of one or two weak and empty wretches; murdering each other for an ideot and a
boy: the conte&s;t only which &s;hould wear a crown with diamonds, or wield an
empty &s;ceptre? Strange infatuation; yet, &s;uch as it was, not le&s;s than
forty thou&s;and men were left dead upon the field, in a&s;&s;erting this
di&s;pute. Warwick gained a complete victory: Edward IV. was e&s;tabli&s;hed on
the throne, and Margaret of Anjou abandoned. She fled, for protection, to
Scotland, with her &s;on and hu&s;band, in order to attempt new de&s;igns for
the recovery of her king|dom. Edward now took down the head of his father from
the walls of York, and put up the <PB N="181" REF="184"> heads of the conquered
Generals in its &s;tead. Each party, as it happened to be victorious, thus
called in the executioner to complete the tragedy begun in the field; and our
cruelty to each other, in civil di&s;cords, is what has impre&s;&s;ed
foreigners with an idea of Engli&s;h cruelty.</P>
<P>Though wretched as this reign was, yet the art of printing, which
was introduced into it at that time, &s;eemed to make amends for a part of its
ca|lamities: William Caxton, a mercer, was the fir&s;t who practi&s;ed the art
at London; he tran&s;lated &s;ome books him&s;elf from the French, and printed
the tran&s;lations of others. Among the writers of that time were Lord Rivers
and Earl Tiptoft, who&s;e labours, however, never ventured higher than
tran|&s;lation. To judge of the learning of tho&s;e times by the works of the
laity in the vulgar tongue, we &s;hall entertain the mo&s;t de&s;picable
opinion of it; yet, when I read the Latin productions of &s;ome of the
prie&s;ts of that period, I cannot avoid allow|ing the authors no &s;mall
&s;hare of erudition. The truth is, learning was &s;eparated from the
purpo&s;es of common life, at that time, but by no means unknown or neglected
by the clergy, as we are taught to believe.</P>

<P>WHATEVER &s;ide was victorious, in the&s;e times of civil
&s;laughter, could confirm their inju&s;tice with the &s;hew of authority. The
parlia|ment u&s;ually followed the conqueror, and fixed him upon the throne,
when he had an army to back his preten&s;ions. Edward was immediately, upon
this victory, confirmed by their unanimous <PB N="182" REF="185"> approbation,
while Henry and his Queen were to &s;eek for new re&s;ources in France and
Scotland. No calamity was able to abate Margaret's per&s;everance; though &s;o
often overcome, yet &s;he was once more re&s;olved to enter England with five
thou&s;and men, granted her by the French King, bringing the un|fortunate Henry
with her to enforce her claims. Her u&s;ual ill fortune attended her; her
little fleet was di&s;per&s;ed by a tempe&s;t, and &s;he her&s;elf entered the
Tweed with no &s;mall difficulty. Again, how|ever, &s;he offered her enemy
battle, and was again defeated, near Hexham. The lo&s;s of this battle &s;eemed
to deprive her of every re&s;ource: &s;he and her hu&s;band were now obliged to
find &s;afety in a &s;eparate flight, without attendants, and without even the
nece&s;&s;aries of life. The weak unfortu|nate Monarch, almo&s;t always
imprudent, and con|&s;equently un&s;ucce&s;sful, thought he could lie
con|cealed in England: his error was &s;oon attended with the natural
con&s;equences; he was taken pri|&s;oner, carried to London with ignominy, and
con|fined in the Tower.</P>
<P>Margaret was rather more fortunate than he, for &s;he e&s;caped,
with the Dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter, out of the kingdom, and retired to her
father, who, though very poor, &s;trove, as well as he could, to &s;upply her
with the mere nece&s;&s;aries of life. You are not to &s;uppo&s;e the
mi&s;eries of the great, at tho&s;e times, were fictitious, as we find them at
pre&s;ent; they, in reality, endured every calamity that poverty now inflicts
on the ob&s;cure&s;t of wretches. Philip de Comines, &s;ays, he &s;aw the Duke
of Exeter following the Duke of Burgundy's equipage, barefoot, and &s;erving
for his livelihood as a footman. This was a &s;trange &s;ituation for a Lord,
who had conducted armies, <PB N="183" REF="186"> and was allied to Kings and
Princes: but the times were barbarous; the Princes on the coa&s;ts of
Ne|groland experience &s;uch rever&s;es of fortune at this very day.</P>
<P>Edward, being now, by means of Warwick, fixed upon the throne,
reigned in peace and &s;ecu|rity. A &s;pirit of gallantry reigned in his court,
mixed with the cruelty which &s;eemed the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing feature of
tho&s;e times of di&s;cord. In the very &s;ame palace which one day &s;moaked
with blood, a pageant or a ma&s;k appeared the day &s;ol|lowing; and the King
would at once gallant a mi&s;tre&s;s and in&s;pect an execution.</P>
<P>As his amours, however, were likely to di&s;&s;a|tisfy his
&s;ubjects, the Earl of Warwick advi&s;ed him to marry; and, with his
con&s;ent, went over to France to procure him Bona of Savoy, and the match was
accordingly, by his means, concluded. But, whil&s;t the Earl was ha&s;tening
the negotiation in France, the King him&s;elf put an effectual &s;top to it at
home, by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, with whom he had fallen in love, and
whom he had vainly &s;trove to debauch. Having thus given War|wick real cau&s;e
of offence, he was re&s;olved to widen the breach by driving him from the
council. We are apt to hate the man we have offended, as much as the man who
has offended us; Edward was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ecurity by
Warwick, than he began to be ungrateful. Warwick, who&s;e pru|dence was equal
to his bravery, &s;oon made u&s;e of both to a&s;&s;i&s;t his revenge: he
&s;educed Clarence, the King's brother, and, to confirm him in his intere&s;ts,
makes him his &s;on-in-law: and now, finding his plot ready for execution,
flies into open rebellion. Vengeance &s;eemed to be the only motive he had in
view: plots, truces, &s;tratagems, <PB N="184" REF="187"> and negotiations,
followed each other in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But Warwick, long acquainted
with intrigue and di&s;&s;imulation, was, at la&s;t, too &s;ubtle for the young
King: inviting him, by a &s;eeming promi&s;e of compo&s;ition, to his hou&s;e,
he threw Edward off his guard; and Warwick, &s;eizing the opportunity, made him
a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Nothing now appeared that could oppo&s;e War|wick's de&s;igns; he
therefore di&s;banded his troops as unnece&s;&s;ary, and Edward was con&s;igned
to the cu&s;tody of the Archbi&s;hop of York. But &s;oon an accident happened
that overthrew all Warwick's expectations: Edward's behaviour, in confinement,
was &s;o very obliging, that he got leave, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, to hunt in
a park adjoining the place of his confinement; from thence he one day made his
e&s;cape, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a couple of his friends, and, contrary to
all expectation, in&s;tantly repaired to York.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed to be for Edward; and, march|ing &s;ome troops to
London, the citizens imme|diately declared in his favour. It is &s;urpri&s;ing
to think how one party is &s;een this day at the head of numerous forces, while
the next we be|hold it abandoned, and the adver&s;e party triumph|ing without a
rival: a &s;trong proof of the fluctu|ating di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h.
Edw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rd now commanded a numerous
army, while Warwick, and his brother Clarence, were attended by a few. The
King, re&s;olving to take the advantage of their weakne&s;s, after having
defeated a party command|ed by Lord Wells, and cut off his head, the u&s;ual
method of treating the pri&s;oners of either party, he marched to give them
battle. In this exigence they had no other cour&s;e to take, but to embark, in
order to &s;creen them&s;elves from impending dan|ger. <PB N="185" REF="188">
Having arrived &s;afely in France, they now were reconciled to Queen Margaret,
their former enemy; and, returning from France, Warwick once more &s;aw
him&s;elf at the head of no le&s;s than &s;ixty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>It was now become Edward's turn to fly the kingdom; and, e&s;caping
the dangers of the ene|my, of the &s;ea and of pyrates, he landed &s;afely in
Holland. Warwick, in the mean time, advanced to London, and once more poor
pa&s;&s;ive Henry was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, and placed upon an u&s;ele&s;s
throne. Warwick was received, among the people, by the name of
<HI>King-maker:</HI> a parliament was call|ed, and confirmed Henry's right; but
they were now only mini&s;ters of the will of the victor.</P>
<P>Edward, though an exile in Holland, had many partizans at home; and,
after an ab&s;ence of about nine months, once more landed at Raven&s;pur, where
Henry IV. had landed upon a &s;imilar occa|&s;ion. Though at fir&s;t he was
coldly received by the Engli&s;h, yet his army increa&s;ed upon its march, and
his moderation and &s;eigned humility &s;till added to the number of his
partizans. London, at this time, ever ready to admit the mo&s;t powerful,
open|ed her gates, and Henry was again taken from his throne to be &s;ent back
to his old man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Warwick at la&s;t found his party begin to decline, and Clarence,
the King's brother, on whom he had the greate&s;t dependence, changed to the
other &s;ide. In this &s;tate of uncertainty, he knew no other expedient than
to hazard a battle: he knew his forces to be inferior, but he was con&s;cious
of the &s;uperiority of his own general&s;hip. With this re&s;olution he
marched from St. Alban's, and, hav|ing advanced to Barnet, within ten miles of
Lon|don, he met Edward, who was marching down <PB N="186" REF="189"> with a
de&s;ign to fight him. Warwick and Ed|ward were the two mo&s;t renowned
Generals of their age, and now was to be &s;truck the deci|&s;ive blow, that
was either to fix Edward on the throne, or overthrow his preten&s;ions for
ever. The unfortunate Henry was dragged along to be a &s;pec|tator of the
engagement; happy in his natural im|becillity, which &s;eemed to opiate all his
afflictions.</P>
<P>The battle began early in the morning, and la&s;ted till noon: never
did two armies fight with greater ob&s;tinacy and bravery; not honour, but
life, depended upon the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t. The example of Warwick
in&s;pired his troops with more than common re&s;olution; and the victory, for
a while, &s;eemed to declare for him: but his army, by rea&s;on of a &s;light
mi&s;t, happening to mi&s;take a body of their own forces for that of the
enemy, fell furiou&s;ly upon them, and this fatal error turn|ed the fortune of
the day. Warwick did all that experience, conduct, or valour, could
&s;ugge&s;t, to retrieve the mi&s;take, but in vain. Finding, there|fore, all
hopes gone, he was re&s;olved to &s;ell his life dearly to the conquerors; and,
ru&s;hing, on foot as he was, into the mid&s;t of his enemies, he fell covered
all over with wounds. Thus died the am|bitious Warwick, who had made and unmade
Kings at plea&s;ure, yet who never &s;eemed to a&s;pire at regal dignity
him&s;elf. Ten thou&s;and of his ar|my &s;hared the &s;ame fate with him, the
King hav|ing ordered that no quarter &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>Margaret, who was ever fruitful in re&s;ources, was, at this time,
returning from France, with her &s;on the Prince of Wales, where &s;he had been
negotiating a new &s;upply. She had &s;carce time to refre&s;h her&s;elf from
the fatigues of her voyage, when &s;he received the fatal news of the death of 
<PB N="187" REF="190"> the brave Warwick, who was then her only de|fender.
Though &s;he had hitherto bravely with|&s;tood all the attacks of fortune, this
was too vio|lent a &s;hock for nature to &s;upport: her grief now, for the
fir&s;t time, found way in a torrent of tears; and, yielding to her unhappy
fate, &s;he took &s;anc|tuary in an abbey in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>She had not been here long, when &s;he found &s;ome few friends
&s;till willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t her fallen hopes. The Duke of Somer&s;et, the
Earl of Pem|broke, and one or two Lords more, came to offer her their lives and
fortunes: a dawn of hope was &s;uf|ficient to rai&s;e her courage, and her
numerous misfortunes gave way to the flattering pro&s;pect of another trial.
She had now fought battles in al|mo&s;t every province in England: Tewke&s;bury
park was the la&s;t &s;cene, that terminated her misfor|tunes. The Duke of
Somer&s;et headed her army: a man who had &s;hared her dangers, and had ever
been &s;teady in her cau&s;e. He was valiant, generous, and polite, but ra&s;h
and head&s;trong: when Edward fir&s;t attacked him in his intrench|ments, he
repul&s;ed him with &s;uch vigour, that the enemy retired with precipitation;
Somer&s;et, &s;up|po&s;ing them routed, immediately pur&s;ued, and or|dered
Lord Wenlock to &s;upport him, while he charged: but this Lord di&s;obeyed his
injunctions, and the forces of Somer&s;et were over-powered by numbers.
Somer&s;et now, finding all gone, was unable to govern his rage: he had
depended upon Wenlock; but, when he beheld him inactive, in the very place
where he had fir&s;t drawn up his men, giving way to his tran&s;port, with his
heavy battle-ax in both hands, he ran upon the coward, and, with one blow,
da&s;hed out his brains.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="191"> After the battle, the Queen, torpid with
griefs was taken pri&s;oner, and afterwards had the mi&s;ery of finding her
&s;on, the Prince of Wales, in the &s;ame condition. But this noble youth was
not long in bondage: being brought into the victor's pre&s;ence, he appeared
before him with un|daunted maje&s;ty. Edward, &s;urprized at the boy's
behaviour, a&s;ked him, How he dur&s;t enter into his dominions without leave? 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I have entered the do|minions of my father,</HI>
replied the Prince, <HI>to revenge his injuries, and to redre&s;s my
own.</HI></Q> The barbarous Monarch, enraged at his intrepidity, &s;truck him
on the mouth with his gauntlet: this &s;eemed to be the &s;ignal for his death;
Glouce&s;ter, Clarence, and others, like wild bea&s;ts, ru&s;hing upon the
unarmed youth at once, &s;tabbed him to the heart with their daggers. When the
governors of a kingdom behave thus, what mu&s;t be the behaviour of the people?
To complete the tragedy, Henry him&s;elf, who had long been the pa&s;&s;ive
&s;pectator of all the&s;e cruelties, was now thought unfit to live. The Duke
of Glouce&s;ter, afterwards named Ri|chard III, or the Crouch-back, entering
his cham|ber alone, murdered him in cold blood. Of all tho&s;e that were taken,
none were &s;uffered to &s;ur|vive but Margaret her&s;elf: it was, perhaps,
ex|pected that &s;he would be ran&s;omed by the King of France, and in this
they were not deceived: Lewis XI. paid the King of England fifty thou|&s;and
crowns for her freedom, Thus Margaret of Anjou, after having &s;u&s;tained the
cau&s;e of her hu&s;band in twelve battles, after having &s;urvived her fortune
and her children, died a few years after in privacy in France, very mi&s;erable
indeed; but with no other claims to our pity, except her cou|rage and her
di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="192"> Of all people in the world the Engli&s;h are
the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate; a throne rai&s;ed upon cruelty never wanted
enemies among them, and nothing could ever have been more ridiculous than
attempt|ing to govern &s;uch &s;ubjects as the Engli&s;h by the hand of the
executioner. The heads of either faction &s;eemed to have been in&s;en&s;ible
of this truth, and it was their ill-judged puni&s;hments, which, by turns,
plunged them into new di&s;tre&s;&s;es. A tyrant, however, when once drenched
in blood, knows not when to give over. Edward, being now freed from great
enemies, turned to the pu|ni&s;hment of tho&s;e of le&s;&s;er note: the gibbets
were hung with his adver&s;aries, and their e&s;tates confi&s;|cated to his
u&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet, while he was thus rendering him&s;elf ter|rible on the one
hand, he was immer&s;ed in gal|lantry on the other. Nature, it &s;eems, was not
unfavourable to him in this re&s;pect, for he was univer&s;ally allowed to be
the mo&s;t beautiful man of his time. The court &s;eemed willing to
coun|tenance tho&s;e debaucheries, in which they had a &s;hare; and the clergy,
as they them&s;elves prac|ti&s;ed every &s;pecies of lewdne&s;s with impunity,
were ever ready to lend ab&s;olution for all his fail|ings. The truth is,
enormous vices had been of late &s;o common, that adultery was held but a very
&s;light offence: among the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es was the wife of one
Shore, a woman of exqui&s;ite beauty and good &s;en&s;e, but who had not virtue
enough to with&s;tand the temptations of a beautiful man and a Monarch.</P>
<P>England now enjoying a temporary calm, the King thought the be&s;t
way to ingratiate him&s;elf with the people, was to a&s;&s;ert his right to his
do|mains in France, which the in&s;urrections of his <PB N="190" REF="193">
father had contributed to alienate in the former reign: this propo&s;al was
&s;ure of plea&s;ing the Eng|li&s;h, who ever appeared more fond of &s;plendid
than u&s;eful acqui&s;itions. To pro&s;ecute this &s;cheme, therefore, he
&s;ends his ally, the Duke of Burgun|dy, a reinforcement of three thou&s;and
men, and &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed over him&s;elf at the head of a nu|merous
army. Lewis XI, then King of France, was, with rea&s;on, alarmed at this
formidable inva|&s;ion: he found him&s;elf unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;o power|ful
an antagoni&s;t, and therefore had recour&s;e to treaty: this &s;ucceeded
better than arms could have done; the two Kings had an interview at the bridge
of Perpignan, and, upon the pay|ment of a &s;tipulated &s;um, Edward led his
forces back to England. The Engli&s;h King wanted to return home to his
mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to &s;pend upon them the money he had gotten; and the French
Mo|narch hoped to be able to refu&s;e tho&s;e &s;ums which he had only given a
promi&s;e to pay.</P>
<P>Edward returned to renew his cruelty and his exce&s;&s;es. His
brother Clarence, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in gaining the crown, had been,
for &s;ome time, treated with indifference and di&s;re&s;pect: this Clarence
thought an ill recompence for his former &s;ervices, and often gave him&s;elf
the liberty of in|vective in the King's ab&s;ence. In this po&s;ture of things,
the King happened to kill a favourite deer, belonging to Mr. Thomas Burdet, a
friend of the Duk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">'s: poor Burdet,
dropping &s;ome ha&s;ty ex|pre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the King, was &s;entenced to
die, and executed in two days after. The Duke of Clarence, upon the death of
his friend, vented his grief in renewed reproaches again&s;t his brother: the
King, unmindful of the ties of kindred, or the debt of gratitude, by which he
was bound <PB N="191" REF="194"> had him arraigned, condemned, and executed: he
was &s;mothered in a butt of Malm&s;ey wine. When men arrive at a certain
&s;tation of greatne&s;s, their regards are di&s;&s;ipated on too great a
number of objects to feel parental affection: the ties of nature are only
&s;trong with tho&s;e who have but few friends or few dependants.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of Edward's life was &s;pent in riot and debauchery, in
gratifications that are plea&s;ing only to the narrow mind; in u&s;ele&s;s
treaties, in which he was ever deceived; and in empty threats again&s;t the
Monarch who had deceived him. His parliament, now merely the mini&s;ters of his
will, con&s;ented to a war with France, at a time when it was impo&s;&s;i|ble
it could &s;ucceed: all the lords unanimou&s;ly de|clared, that they thought it
both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;a|ry. The people &s;eemed equally plea&s;ed at the
pro&s;pect of a war, which might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, alleviate their
dome&s;tic calamities; great prepara|tions were made on every &s;ide, but
Edward died in the mid&s;t of all his expectations. The character of this
Prince is ea&s;ily &s;ummed up; his good qua|lities were courage and beauty;
his bad qualities&mdash;every vice.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>HORRID as the la&s;t reign was, you mu&s;t prepare for events in the
next &s;till more hei|nous. Edward left two &s;ons, the elde&s;t of whom, a boy
between twelve and thirteen, was proclaim|ed King, by the name of Edward V. The
Queen, his mother, being her&s;elf newly rai&s;ed among the nobility, &s;eemed
willing to hide the meanne&s;s of <PB N="192" REF="195"> her former condition
among&s;t a number of new promotions: this, as might naturally be expected, was
di&s;plea&s;ing to the old nobility; and the Duke of Glouce&s;ter, a mon&s;ter
both for the cruelty of his heart, and the deformity of his body, fomented
their di&s;contents. Having gained over Lord Ha&s;t|ings, the Duke of
Buckingham, and &s;ome other lords, to his intere&s;ts, he made them a long
&s;peech, tending to &s;hew the danger that hung over their heads, if the Queen
&s;hould have the government in her hands: he enlarged upon the u&s;urpations
of her family, and the lengths they would be apt to run upon being inve&s;ted
with the &s;upreme power. In &s;hort, he &s;pared neither di&s;&s;imulation nor
arti|fice, nor oaths, to get the guardian&s;hip of the minority, and the
cu&s;tody of the King's per&s;on.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t &s;tep, after being declared Protector of the kingdom,
was to get the King's brother, al&s;o a boy of about &s;even, who, with the
Queen his mother, had taken &s;anctuary in We&s;tmin&s;ter-ab|bey. The Queen
fore&s;aw the dangers which threatened her family; and, parting with her child,
cla&s;ped him, with a la&s;t embrace, to her brea&s;t, and took leave of him
with a &s;hower of tears. The Duke of Glouce&s;ter, on the other hand, took his
young nephew in his arms, and, cla&s;ping him, with feigned affection,
declared, that, while he him|&s;elf was alive, the child &s;hould never want a
parent. The young King, finding that he was to have the plea&s;ure of his
brother's company, was greatly re|joiced, without con&s;idering the fatal
intention of the&s;e preparations: a few days after, the Protec|tor, upon a
pretext of guarding them from danger, conveyed them both to the Tower.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured their per&s;ons, the Protec|tor's next &s;tep
was to &s;pread a report of their ille|gitimacy; <PB N="193" REF="196"> and, by
pretended ob&s;tacles, to put off the day of the young King's coronation. Lord
Stanley, a man of deep penetration, was the fir&s;t to di&s;clo&s;e his fears
of the Protector's having ill de&s;igns: he communicated his &s;u&s;picions to
Lord Ha&s;tings, who was firmly attached to the young King, perhaps this lord's
wi&s;hes, that &s;uch a pro|ject might not be true, influenced his judgment,
and confirmed him in his &s;ecurity. Soon, however, Cate&s;by, a vile creature
of the Protector's, was &s;ent to &s;ound him, and try whether he could not be
brought over to &s;ide with the projected u&s;urpa|tion: Ha&s;tings appeared
immoveable in his adhe|rence to the King, and his death was therefore
re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>With this de&s;ign, the Protector next day called a council in the
Tower, under the pretence of ex|pediting the coronation: he came thither
him&s;elf at nine o'clock in the morning, with a chearful countenance,
&s;aluting the members with the ut|mo&s;t affability, and appearing with
demon&s;trations of unu&s;ual good humour; and then, going out for a &s;hort
time, de&s;ired his ab&s;ence might not in|terrupt the debates. In about an
hour he returned again, quite altered, knitting his brows, biting his lips, and
&s;hewing, by the frequent alterations of his looks, &s;ome inward
perturbation. A &s;ilence en&s;ued for &s;ome time, and the lords looked upon
each other, not without rea&s;on, expecting &s;ome horrid cata&s;trophe: at
length he broke the dread|ful &s;ilence, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lords,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>What puni&s;hment
do they de&s;erve who have con&s;pired again&s;t my life?</HI></Q> This
redoubled the a&s;toni&s;hment of the a&s;&s;embly, and, continuing their
&s;ilence, Lord Ha&s;tings at length made an&s;wer, That whoever did &s;o
de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed as a traitor: upon which the Protec|tor, 
<PB N="194" REF="197"> with a &s;tern countenance, baring his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ther|ed arm, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>See what the &s;orcere&s;s my Queen|&s;i&s;ter,
and that wretch, Shore's wife, have done by their witcherafts! Their &s;pells
have reduced my arm to this condition, and my whole body would have &s;uffered
the &s;ame calamity, but for a timely detection.</HI></Q> The amaze|ment of the
council &s;eemed to increa&s;e at this ter|rible accu&s;ation, and Lord
Ha&s;tings again &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">IF <HI>they have committed &s;uch a crime, they
de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment.</HI> IF,</Q> cried the Protector, with a loud voice,
Do&s;t thou an&s;wer me with IFS? 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I tell thee, that they have con&s;pired my
death; and that thou, traitor, art an accomplice in their crime.</HI></Q> Thus
having &s;aid, he &s;truck the table twice with his hand, and the room was
in&s;tantly filled with armed men. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I arre&s;t thee,</HI> continues he, turning to
Ha&s;tings, <HI>for high trea&s;on;</HI></Q> and, at the &s;ame time, delivered
him to the cu&s;tody of the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The council-room was now filled with tumult; and, though no re&s;cue
was offered, yet the &s;ol|diers cau&s;ed a bu&s;tle, as if they apprehended
dan|ger. One of them narrowly mi&s;&s;ed cleaving Lord Stanley's head with a
battle-ax, but he e&s;caped by &s;hrinking under the table: in all probability,
the fellow had orders for this attempt, &s;o that, when thus killed, his death
might be a&s;cribed to the tu|mult cau&s;ed by an intended re&s;cue. Stanley,
how|ever, e&s;caping the blow, was arre&s;ted by the Pro|tector's order, who
was well apprized of his at|tachment to the young King. As for Lord
Ha&s;t|ings, he was forced to make a &s;hort confe&s;&s;ion to the next
prie&s;t that was at hand; the Protector crying out, by St. Paul, he would not
dine till he had &s;een his head taken off: he was accordingly hurried out to
the little green before the Tower <PB N="195" REF="198"> chapel, and there
beheaded on a log of wood that acccidentally lay there.</P>
<P>But not tho&s;e alone of his council were thus barbarou&s;ly
treated: on the very &s;ame day a &s;imi|lar tragedy was acted at Pontefract
ca&s;tle, where the Earl Rivers, the mo&s;t polite and gallant man of the age
in which he lived, and Lord Grey, were both beheaded by a decree of that very
&s;ame coun|cil, the members of which were now in &s;uch dan|ger them&s;elves.
A plot again&s;t the King was the pretext for their execution; but, in reality,
they died as being the only ob&s;tacles to prevent his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Protector, having thus got rid of tho&s;e he mo&s;t feared,
undertook to puni&s;h even the lea&s;t dangerous: Jane Shore, the late King's
mi&s;tre&s;s, was an enemy too humble for him to fear any thing from her
attempts, yet, as &s;he had been accu&s;ed of witchcraft, of which all the
world &s;aw &s;he was innocent, he thought proper to puni&s;h her for faults of
which &s;he was really guilty. This un|happy woman had been deluded formerly
from her hu&s;band one Shore, a gold&s;mith in Lombard-&s;treet, and continued
with Edward the mo&s;t guiltle&s;s mi&s;|tre&s;s in his luxurious and abandoned
court: &s;he ever interceded for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and was ever ap|plied to
as a mediator for mercy. She was cha|ritable, generous, and plea&s;ing in
conver&s;ation; her wit and her beauty were &s;aid to be irre|&s;i&s;tible.
Being blamele&s;s in other re&s;pects, the Protector ordered her to be &s;ued
for incontinency, for having left her hu&s;band to live in adultery with
another. It is po&s;&s;ible that the people were not di&s;plea&s;ed at
&s;eeing, again reduced to her former meanne&s;s, a per&s;on, who had, for a
while, been rai&s;ed above them, and enjoyed all the favours of 
<PB N="196" REF="199"> the King. Her guilt was too notorious to be de|nied;
&s;he acknowledged the charge, and was con|demned to walk barefoot through the
city, and to do penance in St. Paul's church in a white &s;heet, with a wax
taper in her hand, before thou&s;ands of &s;pectators. She lived above forty
years after this &s;entence, reduced to the mo&s;t extreme wretch|edne&s;s: an
hi&s;torian, in the reign of Henry VII, a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;aw her
gathering herbs in a field near the city, to &s;upply her nightly meal; a
&s;trange employment for one who once had been the favourite of a court, and
the mi&s;tre&s;s of a king.</P>
<P>The Protector now began to lay a&s;ide his pre|tended regard for the
&s;ons of the late King, and to a&s;pire to the throne more openly: to effect
this, the Duke of Buckingham, who by promi&s;es and bribes was devoted to his
intere&s;ts, tried every art to infu&s;e into the people an opinion of the
ba&s;|tardy of the late King, and that of his children. Dr. Shaw, a popular
preacher, was hired to ha|rangue the people from St. Paul's Cro&s;s to the
&s;ame purpo&s;e: the preacher, after having di&s;played the incontinence of
the Queen, in&s;i&s;ted upon the il|legality of the young King's title, and the
virtues of the Protector. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>It is be,</HI> continued the &s;yco|phant,
<HI>who carries in his face, in his &s;oul, the image of virtue, and the marks
of a true de&s;cent.</HI></Q> Still, however, the people continued &s;ilent,
each fear|ing to begin the cry of King Richard, or dete&s;t|ing the tendency of
his &s;ermon. The Duke of Buckingham, therefore, next undertook to per|&s;uade
them in his turn: his &s;peech turned upon the calamities of the la&s;t reign,
and the ba&s;tardy of the pre&s;ent pretender; he &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive,
indeed, that the Protector could not be prevailed <PB N="197" REF="200"> upon
to accept the crown, but he hoped that the people would take every method to
per&s;uade him: he concluded, by de&s;iring every man to &s;peak his real
&s;entiments, and to give a po&s;itive an&s;wer, whether they would have the
young ba&s;tard or the virtuous Protector? A &s;ilence, for &s;ome time,
en|&s;ued; but, at length, &s;ome of the Duke's own &s;ervants, who had
&s;lipped in among the pre&s;s, cried out, Long live King Richard: this cry was
&s;econded by &s;ome of the citizens, who were pre|viou&s;ly bribed; and the
mob at the door, a de|&s;picable cla&s;s of people, ever plea&s;ed with
novel|ty, repeated the cry; and, throwing up their caps, cried out, a Richard,
a Richard. The Duke, now taking the advantage of this faint ap|probation, next
day, at the head of the Mayor and Aldermen, went to wait upon the Protector,
with offers of the crown. Richard, with his u&s;ual hypocri&s;y, appeared to
the crowd in a gallery be|tween two Bi&s;hops, and, at fir&s;t, pretended to be
&s;urprized at the concour&s;e: when he was informed that their bu&s;ine&s;s
was to offer him the crown, he declined accepting it, alledging his love for
the late King his brother, and his affection for the children under his care.
Buckingham, &s;eeming di&s;plea&s;ed with this an&s;wer, muttered &s;ome words
to him&s;elf, and, at length, plainly told him, that all the people had
determined upon making him King: that they had now proceeded too far to
re|cede, and therefore were re&s;olved, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al, to offer it
where it would meet with a more ready acceptance. This was a re&s;olution,
which the Protector's tenderne&s;s for his people could not permit him to &s;ee
executed: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I &s;ee,</HI> cried he in a mode&s;t tone, <HI>I
&s;ee the kingdom is re&s;olved to load me with preferments, unequal to my
abilities or my</HI> <PB N="198" REF="201"> <HI>choice; yet, &s;ince it is my
duty to obey the dictates of a free people, I will graciou&s;ly accept their
petition. I, therefore, from this moment, enter upon the government of England
and France, with a re&s;olution to defend the one, and to &s;ubdue the
other.</HI></Q> The crowd being thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, each returned home,
pondering upon the proceedings of the day, and making &s;uch remarks, as
pa&s;&s;ion, intere&s;t, or prudence, might &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>One crime ever draws on others, and u&s;urpa|tion naturally required
&s;ecurity: as &s;oon, there|fore, as he was fixed upon the throne, Richard
&s;ent the governor of the Tower orders to put the two young Princes to death.
There was yet one man left in the kingdom, who had virtue enough to refu&s;e
being made the in&s;trument of a tyrant's cruelty: the governor of the Tower,
who&s;e name was Brackenbury, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively an&s;wered, that he could not
embrue his hands in their blood. A fit in&s;trument, however, was not wanting
long: one James Tyrrel was employed and &s;ent to command the Tower for one
night. Tyrrel, that very night, whil&s;t all were a&s;leep, went to the chamber
where the two young Princes lay; here the murderer, for &s;ome time,
he&s;itated in his ba&s;e de&s;ign, &s;truck, as it is &s;aid, with the
innocence of their looks: but, habit getting the better of remor&s;e, he at
la&s;t &s;mothered them between two pillows, and cau&s;ed them to be buried
under a little &s;tair-ca&s;e, near where they lay. Vengeance, though late,
fol|lowed this execrable wretch; he was executed for this fact in the
&s;ucceeding reign, when he confe&s;&s;|ed his crime and the manner of its
execution.</P>
<P>The warlike &s;pirit, fir&s;t excited by the conque&s;t of France,
and then kept up by the long civil war, &s;eemed to have bani&s;hed every
&s;entiment of <PB N="199" REF="202"> virtue from the kingdom: cruelty and
executions were grown &s;o common, that the people now be|came familiar with
blood and death: &s;carce a noble family in the kingdom which was not thinned
by the&s;e terrible di&s;&s;en&s;ions. The clergy &s;eemed, at this time, quite
&s;eparated from the laity; they &s;el|dom &s;uffered for trea&s;on, and were
but little con|ver&s;ant in the bloody politics of the times. As for arts,
&s;ciences, and commerce, they were totally neglected. In all this carnage and
de&s;olation, one power was imperceptibly gaining ground; as the lords were
declining, the commons were coming into authority; not &s;o much expo&s;ed, as
the for|mer, to the tempe&s;ts of regal re&s;entment, they continued to
increa&s;e in wealth and favour, and found &s;afety from their humility.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;omewhat that peculiarly &s;trikes the imagination in the
tran&s;actions of this and the preceding reign; I have therefore treated them
with more than u&s;ual prolixity. Our tragic poets &s;eem to have been
&s;en&s;ible how much the&s;e &s;trange in&s;tances of depravation were
&s;u&s;ceptible of a poetic dre&s;s. Every picture of the times is marked with
&s;trong lines, like an African pro|&s;pect, where all is va&s;t, wild, and
terrible.</P>
<P>Richard had, at length, waded through every ob&s;tacle to the
throne, and now began, after the u&s;ual manner of all u&s;urpers, to
&s;trengthen, by his ill got power, foreign alliances. Sen&s;ible al&s;o of the
influence of pageantry and &s;hew upon the minds of the people, he cau&s;ed
him&s;elf to be <PB N="200" REF="203"> crowned fir&s;t at London, and then at
York. The clergy he endeavoured to &s;ecure in his intere&s;ts, by great
indulgences to them, and by his own hy|pocritical behaviour.</P>
<P>But, while he endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his power, he found it
undermining, on a &s;ide from whence he lea&s;t expected it: the Duke of
Buck|ingham, who had been the principal in&s;trument in placing him upon the
throne, now began to expect the reward of his adherence. Richard, in|deed, had
given him &s;everal po&s;ts and governments, but denied him a moiety of the
con&s;i&s;cated lands of Hereford, to which he had &s;ome family claims. Very
great obligations between two friends, on either &s;ide, generally end in
di&s;gu&s;t: Bucking|ham &s;uppo&s;ed that his &s;ervices could never be
over-rewarded; while Richard, on the contrary, was willing to curb his
de&s;ires, which &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e by gratification. Soon, therefore, the
Duke was di&s;gu&s;ted with the new Monarch, and as &s;oon conceived a &s;cheme
for depriving him of the crown. Doubtful, for a while, whether he &s;hould put
in for the crown him&s;elf, or &s;et up another; the latter opinion prevailed,
and he was re&s;olved to declare for Henry, Duke of Richmond, then an exile in
Bretagne. Henry, of Richmond, was one of tho&s;e who had the good fortune to
&s;urvive the numerous ma&s;&s;acres of the preceding reigns: he was the only
remaining branch of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; he was de&s;cended from John of
Ghaunt, but, by the female line; his right to the throne was very doubtful, but
the crimes of the u&s;urper &s;trengthened his claims. He had long lived in
exile, and was once delivered up to the amba&s;&s;a|dors of Edward IV, and
ju&s;t upon the point of being brought back to England, to &s;uffer a cruel 
<PB N="201" REF="204"> death; when the Prince, who had delivered him up,
repented of what he had done, and took him from the amba&s;&s;adors, ju&s;t as
he was brought on &s;hip|board. This was the youth whom the Duke of Buckingham
pitched upon to dethrone the tyrant, and a negotiation was commenced between
them for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Richard, in the mean time, either informed by his creatures, or made
di&s;tru&s;tful by con&s;cious guilt, &s;u&s;pected a con&s;piracy, and could
not avoid think|ing Buckingham among the number of the con|&s;pirators.
Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, he came to a re&s;olution of
&s;ending for him to court, and the Duke's refu&s;ing to come confirmed him in
his belief: but &s;oon he had no cau&s;e to doubt of his treachery, for word
was brought, that the Duke of Buckingham was up in arms. The Duke, having found
that he could di&s;&s;emble with Richard no longer, had drawn together &s;ome
Welch forces, and began to march to the we&s;tern &s;hore, where he had
appointed young Richmond to land. Richard, however, no way di&s;mayed at the
approaching danger, prepared to meet him with the few forces he then had in
readine&s;s; but fortune &s;eemed to favour the u&s;urper, and rendered his
preparations, for this time, needle&s;s. As Buckingham was ad|vancing, by
ha&s;ty marches, towards Glouce&s;ter, where he de&s;igned to pa&s;s the
Severn, ju&s;t then the river was &s;wollen to &s;uch a degree, that the
coun|try, on both &s;ides, was deluged, and even the tops of mountains covered
with water. It held ten days, during which the Welch army could neither pa&s;s
the river, nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the other &s;ide, where they found nothing but
de&s;olation: at length, compelled by hunger, after having &s;uffered a
thou|&s;and hard&s;hips, they all di&s;per&s;ed, and returned 
<PB N="202" REF="205"> home, notwith&s;tanding the Duke's intreaties &s;o the
contrary. In this helple&s;s &s;ituation, the Duke, after a moment's reflexion,
thought the propere&s;t place of &s;afety he could fix upon, was at the hou&s;e
of one Bani&s;ter, who had been his &s;ervant, and who had received repeated
obligations from his family. No maxim was ever more ju&s;t, than, that there is
no friend&s;hip among the wicked: Buckingham had him&s;elf been fir&s;t fal&s;e
to his King, and after to Richard, the creature of his own power; how then
could he expect fidelity from others? A large reward was &s;et upon the Duke's
head: the villain Bani&s;ter, unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;o great a temptation,
went and betrayed his ma&s;|ter to the Sheriff of Shrop&s;hire, who,
&s;urrounding the hou&s;e with armed men, &s;eized the Duke in a pea&s;ant's
dre&s;s, and conducted him to Shrew&s;bury, where he was beheaded, without the
form of a trial, or delay.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Richmond landed in Eng|land, but, finding his
hopes fru&s;trated, by the cata&s;trophe of Buckingham, he ha&s;tily &s;et
&s;ail again, and returned to Bretagne. Richard, thus freed from the impending
danger, gave a loo&s;e to cruelty, the favourite pa&s;&s;ion of his brea&s;t.
In or|der to expedite his revenge, he gave one A&s;hton an unbounded
commi&s;&s;ion to condemn and execute, upon the &s;pot, &s;uch as were deemed
by him guilty, or even &s;u&s;pected of guilt. A cruel King never wants a
bloody mini&s;ter: A&s;hton executed his commi&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t
rigour, putting hu&s;|bands to death in pre&s;ence of their own wives, and
children before the eyes of their parents. It is &s;aid, that, this execrable
wretch being &s;ollicited by a beautiful woman to relea&s;e her hu&s;band, who
was a pri&s;oner upon &s;u&s;picion, he con&s;ented, upon <PB N="203" REF="206"> her promi&s;ing to grant him a favour of another nature: &s;carce
had the poor creature indulged his brutal de&s;ire, when he brought her out,
and point|ed to her hu&s;band, whom, in the mean time, he had given orders
&s;hould be hanged upon a neigh|bouring tree!</P>
<P>Still, however, the authority of a parliament was wanting, to give
&s;anction to the inju&s;tice of Richard's proceedings: but, in the&s;e times
of vice and &s;ervility, that was &s;oon procured. The par|liament approved his
proceedings, confirmed the illegitimacy of Edward's children, pa&s;&s;ed an act
of attainder again&s;t the Earl of Richmond, and all his adherents; and
&s;eemed, upon the whole, more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;lavery, than he to be a
tyrant. One thing more was yet wanting to complete his &s;ecurity, the death of
his rival: to effect this, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Duke of Bretagne,
with whom Richmond had taken &s;helter, &s;eemingly upon bu&s;ine&s;s of a
public nature, but, in reality, to treat with Laudais, that Prince's prime
mini&s;ter, and to induce him to deliver up Richmond. The mini&s;ter was ba&s;e
enough to enter into the nego|tiation; but Richmond, having had timely notice,
fled away into France, and had ju&s;t reached the limits of that kingdom, when
his pur&s;uers came up with him.</P>
<P>Richard, finding his de&s;ign of &s;eizing his ene|my's per&s;on
without &s;ucce&s;s, as his power became more precarious, became, every day,
more &s;u&s;pi|cious and more cruel. Lord Stanley, who was now married to the
widow of Edward IV, fell &s;trongly under his &s;u&s;picion; and, to &s;ecure
his fidelity, he took the &s;on as an ho&s;tage for his fa|ther's good
behaviour. He now al&s;o re&s;olved to get rid of his pre&s;ent Queen, in order
to marry his <PB N="204" REF="207"> own niece; a match from which he expected
to derive &s;everal advantages. The Lady he was then married to was formerly
the wife of the young Prince of Wales, that was murdered by him at
Tewke&s;bury. It is no &s;light indication of the bar|barity of the times to
find a woman thus taking the murderer of her hu&s;band for her &s;econd lord.
She felt, however, the con&s;equences of her in|gratitude to the decea&s;ed
Prince, in the inhuma|nity of the pre&s;ent: Richard treated her with &s;o much
contempt and indifference, that &s;he died of grief, according to his de&s;ire.
But his wi&s;hes were not crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in his applications to his
niece; &s;he treated his vile pa&s;&s;ion with re|taliated contempt and ju&s;t
dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>In the perplexity, cau&s;ed by this unexpected re|fu&s;al, it was,
that he received the news of Rich|mond's being once more landed at
Milford-haven, with an intent to deprive him of the crown: but, being informed
that he brought with him but two thou&s;and men, he &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e the
effort, and i&s;&s;ued orders to oppo&s;e him with the greate&s;t coolne&s;s
and intrepidity. Richard was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage and military conduct,
and the&s;e were his only virtues. Having heard that Richmond was marching with
his little army to London, he was re&s;olved to meet him on the way, and end
the preten&s;ions of one, or the other, by a battle. Richmond, though very much
inferior in number, was not le&s;s defirous of engaging; &s;o that the two
armies &s;oon met at Bo&s;worth field, to deter|mine a di&s;pute that had now,
for more than thirty years, drained England of its brave&s;t &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Richard, perceiving his enemy advance, drew up his army,
con&s;i&s;ting of about thirteen thou&s;and men, in order of battle; he gave
the command of <PB N="205" REF="208"> the van-guard to the Duke of Norfolk, and
led the main body him&s;elf, with the crown on his head, either de&s;igning by
this to in&s;pire the ene|my with awe, or to render him&s;elf con&s;picuous to
his own army. The Earl of Richmond, who had not half the number of men, drew up
his forces al&s;o in two lines, the Earl of Oxford com|manding the fir&s;t, and
he him&s;elf the &s;econd: Lord Stanley, in the mean time, po&s;ted him&s;elf
in one flank between the two armies, and his bro|ther took his &s;tation in the
other, which was op|po&s;ite. Richard, &s;eeing him thus in a &s;ituation
equally convenient for joining either army, im|mediately &s;ent him orders to
join him, which the other refu&s;ing, he gave in&s;tant command for be|heading
Lord Stanley's &s;on, whom he had kept as an ho&s;tage; but, being per&s;uaded
to po&s;tpone the execution till after the fight, he complied, and immediately
ordered the trumpets to &s;ound to bat|tle. The two armies approaching each
other, the battle began with a &s;hower of arrows, and &s;oon the two ranks
began to clo&s;e: this was what Stan|ley expected, who immediately, profiting
him&s;elf of the occa&s;ion, joined the line of Richmond, and turned the
fortune of the day. In the mean while, Richard &s;purred up his hor&s;e into
the thicke&s;t of the fight, and Richmond quitted his &s;tation be|hind, to
encourage his troops, by his pre&s;ence in the front. Richard, perceiving him,
was willing to end all by one blow; and, with the fury of a lion, flew through
thou&s;ands to attack him. He &s;lew Sir William Brandon, the Earl's
&s;tandard-bearer, who had attempted to &s;top his career; Sir John Cheney,
having taken Brandon's place, was thrown to the ground: Richmond, in the mean
time, &s;tood to oppo&s;e him; but, the crowd inter|po&s;ing, 
<PB N="206" REF="209"> they were &s;eparated. Richard now, there|fore, went to
in&s;pire his troops at another quar|ter; but, at la&s;t, perceiving his army
every-where yielding or flying, and now finding that all was gone, he ru&s;hed,
with a loud &s;hout, into the mid&s;t of the enemy, and there met a better
death than his actions had merited: after the battle his body being found
amid&s;t an heap of &s;laughter, &s;tripped naked, covered over with wounds,
and the eyes frightfully &s;taring, was thrown acro&s;s an hor&s;e, the head
hanging down on one &s;ide and the legs on the other, and &s;o carried to
Leice&s;ter. It lay there two days, expo&s;ed to public view, and then was
buried without farther ceremony.</P>
<P>Richard's crown, being found, by one of the &s;oldiers, in the field
of battle, was immediately placed upon the head of the conqueror; the whole
army, as if in&s;pired, with one voice, crying out, Long live King Henry. Thus
ended the bloody reign of Richard; and, by his death the race of the
Plantagenet Kings, that had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown during the
&s;pace of three hundred and thirty years, became extinct. Thus ended al&s;o
the conte&s;ts between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, which had, for
thirty years, been as a pe&s;tilence to the kingdom, and in which above an
hundred thou&s;and men lo&s;t their lives, either by the executioner, or on the
field of battle.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions had reduced the kingdom to a &s;tate of
almo&s;t &s;avage barbarity; laws, arts, and commerce were entirely neglected
for the practice of arms; and to be a conqueror was &s;ufficient, in the eyes
of the people, to &s;tand for every other virtue. They had, as yet, no idea of
pacific government, nor could lend applau&s;e to tho&s;e who cultivated it,
and, except only in their gallantry <PB N="207" REF="210"> to the fair &s;ex,
they little differed from the ancient painted inhabitants of the i&s;land. In
the&s;e wars the women, though never &s;o formidable, or never &s;o active,
unle&s;s accu&s;ed of witchcraft, were ex|empted from capital puni&s;hments,
which probably proceeded from a &s;pirit of gallantry, the &s;ingle virtue of
the times. As for the clergy, they were entirely di&s;tinct from the laity,
both in cu&s;tomes, con&s;titutions, and learning: they were governed by the
civil law, drawn up by one of the Roman Emperors; whereas the laity were
governed by the common law, which was traditionally deli|vered to them from
their ance&s;tors. The clergy, however you may be told to the contrary,
under|&s;tood and wrote Latin tolerably well; the laity, on the other hand,
under&s;tood no Latin, but ap|plied them&s;elves wholly to French, when they
a&s;pired to the character of politene&s;s. The clergy, as a body, little
intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the civil polity, and perhaps were not
di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the laity, whom they con&s;idered not as
fellow-&s;ubjects, but rivals for power, weakening them&s;elves by con|tinual
conte&s;ts: the laity regarded the clergy with blind veneration, and this
veneration le&s;&s;ened their regard for their King. In &s;hort, as there was
no virtue among the individuals of the nation, the government was like a
feveri&s;h con&s;titution, ever &s;ubject to ferment and di&s;order. France
&s;erved, for a while, as a drain to the peccant humours; but, when that was no
longer open, the di&s;order &s;eemed to increa&s;e in the internal part of the
con|&s;titution, and produced all the horrors of civil war.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in this &s;tate of the nation that the Earl of Richmond, who
took the name of Henry VII, came to the throne. You are now to be|hold one of
the greate&s;t revolutions, that ever was brought about in any kingdom,
effected by the prudence, clemency, and per&s;everance of one great Prince: a
nation of tumult reduced to civil &s;ubordination; an in&s;olent and factious
ari&s;tocra|cy humbled; wi&s;e laws enacted; commerce re|&s;tored; and the
peaceful-arts rendered amiable to a people, for whom before war only had
charms. In a word, you are now to turn to a period, where the whole government
&s;eems to put on a new form; and to view the actions of a King, if not the
greate&s;t, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t u&s;eful, that ever &s;at upon the Briti&s;h,
or any other throne. Hitherto you have only read the hi&s;tory of a barbarous
na|tion, obeying with reluctance, and governed by caprice; you are henceforth
to view more refined politics, and better concerted &s;chemes; to behold human
wi&s;dom, as if rouzed from her lethargy of thirteen hundred years, exerting
every art to re|duce the natural ferocity of the people, and to in|troduce
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Henry's fir&s;t care, upon coming to the throne, was to marry the
Prince&s;s Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV, and thus unite the intere&s;ts of
the hou&s;es of Lanca&s;ter and York: but, le&s;t the peo|ple &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e he claimed the crown upon the &s;trength of this alliance, he
deferred her corona|tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> two
years after, by which he made evi|dent the priority of his own claim. His reign
happily commenced with an obedience to the laws <PB N="209" REF="212"> that had
been hitherto unknown in England. An act had been pa&s;&s;ed, in the preceding
reign, for the attainder of his friends and followers: this act &s;till
continued in force, and many members of that hou&s;e, by which it was to be
repealed, were tho&s;e who were mentioned in the attainder. To &s;uffer &s;uch
to join in repealing that &s;tatute would be admitting them judges in their own
cau&s;e, to which Henry bravely and ju&s;tly objected: they were, therefore,
obliged to leave the hou&s;e, till an act was pa&s;&s;ed to rever&s;e their
attainder.</P>
<P>Before his reign, it was u&s;ual, when any per|&s;on was attainted,
to take away his life, and give away his fortune to &s;ome court favourite:
Henry wi&s;ely perceived that this had two bad effects; it fir&s;t excited
re&s;entment, by its cruelty; and, in the next place, only made the favourite
too powerful for &s;ubjection. This prudent Monarch took a bet|ter method to
repre&s;s tumult and rebellion: he deprived &s;uch as were caught in arms of
their e&s;tates and fortunes, and the&s;e he re&s;erved for the u&s;e of the
crown. By this means he deprived them of the power to injure him, and he
&s;trength|ened the &s;inews of government, by enriching the crown. A great
part of the mi&s;eries of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors proceeded from their poverty,
and the opulence of the nobility. Henry &s;aw that mo|ney alone could turn the
&s;cale of power into his own hands, and therefore hoarded up all the
con|fi&s;cations of his enemies with the utmo&s;t frugality. Avarice, upon
the&s;e motives, is not only excu&s;a|ble, but prai&s;e-worthy; it is not
meanne&s;s, but oeconomy; and, whatever hi&s;torians tell us of li|berality in
a King, is, at be&s;t, mi&s;placed applau&s;e. Such liberalities are, in
general, extorted from the poor, the indu&s;trious, and the u&s;eful; and
be|&s;towed, <PB N="210" REF="213"> as rewards, upon the rich and powerful;
perhaps upon the &s;ycophants of a court, and flat|terers of debauchery. Henry
was different from his predece&s;&s;ors in this re&s;pect; he gave away few
re|wards to the courtiers about his per&s;on, and none but the poor &s;hared
his benefactions. He relea&s;ed all the pri&s;oners for debt in his dominions,
who&s;e debts did not amount to forty &s;hillings, and paid their creditors
from the royal coffers. His oecono|my rendered him not only u&s;eful to the
poor, but enabled him to be ju&s;t to his own creditors, either abroad or at
home. Tho&s;e &s;ums which he bor|rowed from the city of London, or any of his
&s;ubjects, he repaid at the appointed day, with the utmo&s;t punctuality; and
thus, as he grew ju&s;t in his own dominions, he became re&s;pectable
abroad.</P>
<P>Immediately after his marriage with Elizabeth, he i&s;&s;ued out a
general pardon to all &s;uch as cho&s;e to accept it; but tho&s;e lords, who
had been the favourites of the la&s;t reign, and long u&s;ed to tur|bulence,
refu&s;ed his proffered tenderne&s;s, and flew to arms. Lord Lovel, Humphrey
and Thomas Stafford, placed them&s;elves at the head of this in|&s;urrection:
Henry &s;ent the Duke of Bedford to op|po&s;e the in&s;urgents, with orders to
try what might be the effects of a proffered pardon, previous to his attempts
to reduce them. The Duke punc|tually obeyed his in&s;tructions, but the rebels
&s;eem|ed to li&s;ten to no accommodation: but, contrary to all expectation,
Lord Lovel, apprehen&s;ive of being de&s;erted by his followers, fir&s;t
&s;hewed them the example, and fled away to Flanders. The rebel army, now
without a leader, &s;ubmitted to the mercy of the King, which they received.
The Staffords, who were in the mean time be&s;ieging <PB N="211" REF="214">
Worce&s;ter, hearing of the &s;urrender of their con|federates, attempted to
take &s;anctuary in a church which had no privilege to protect them: being
taken from thence, the elde&s;t of the brothers was executed, the other
received a pardon.</P>
<P>But the people were become &s;o turbulent and factious, by a long
cour&s;e of civil war, that no governor could rule them, nor any King plea&s;e.
One rebellion &s;eemed extingui&s;hed only to give ri&s;e to another: the King
kept, at that time, a &s;on of the Duke of Clarence, who had been formerly
drowned in the butt of wine, as has been mentioned, a pri&s;oner in the Tower.
This poor youth, who was &s;tyled the Earl of Warwick, had long been a
&s;tranger to liberty; he was un|acquainted with men and things, and &s;o
little con|ver&s;ant with common life, from his long and ear|ly confinement,
that he knew not the difference, to u&s;e the words of the hi&s;torian, between
a duck and an hen. This unhappy boy, harmle&s;s as he was, was made an
in&s;trument of to deceive the people: a prie&s;t, of Oxford, had trained up
one Lambert Simnel, a baker's &s;on, to counterfeit the per&s;on of this Earl;
and he in&s;tructed him to talk upon &s;ome facts and occurrences relative to
the court of King Edward. Thus, having prepared him for his purpo&s;e, he &s;et
out for Ireland, judg|ing that the propere&s;t theatre to open the &s;cene: the
plot unfolded to his wi&s;h, Simnel was received and proclaimed King of
Ireland, and he was con|ducted, by the people and judges, with great pomp to
the ca&s;tle, where he was treated conformably to his pretended birth and
di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The King could not avoid being troubled at this impo&s;ture,
becau&s;e he &s;aw his mother-in-law at the bottom of it: he was re&s;olved,
therefore, to <PB N="212" REF="215"> take the advice of his council upon this
occa&s;ion, who, after due deliberation, determined upon con|fining the old
Queen to a mona&s;tery; but, to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ion of trea&s;on, from
one to whom he was &s;o nearly allied, he gave out that &s;he was thus
puni&s;hed for having formerly deli|vered up the Prince&s;s, her daughter, to
King Richard. The people, as u&s;ual, murmured upon this occa&s;ion; but the
King, unmindful of their idle clamours, per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and
&s;he remained in confinement till &s;he died, which did not happen till &s;ome
years after. The next re&s;o|lution of the King's council was to &s;hew the
Earl of Warwick, who was &s;till confined in the Tower, publicly to the people:
in con&s;equence of this, he was led through the principal &s;treets of London,
and conducted, in a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, to St. Paul's, where great numbers
were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee him. Still, however, they proceeded at Dublin to
honour their pretended Monarch, and he was crowned, with great &s;olemnity, in
pre|&s;ence of the Earl of Kildare, the Chancellor, and other officers of
&s;tate. Such impofitions upon the people were very frequent, at that time, in
&s;eve|ral parts of Europe: Lorrain, Naples, and Por|tugal, had their
impo&s;tors, who continued, for a long time, to deceive without detection. In
fact, the inhabitants of every county were &s;o much confined to the limits of
their own peculiar place of abode, and knew &s;o little of what was pa&s;&s;ing
in the re&s;t of the world around them, that nothing was more ea&s;y than to
deceive. King Simnel, be|ing now joined by Lord Lovel, and one or two lords
more of the di&s;contented party, re&s;olved to pa&s;s over into England, and
accordingly landed in Lanca&s;hire: from thence he marched to York, 
<PB N="213" REF="216"> expecting the country would ri&s;e and join him as he
pa&s;&s;ed along. But in this he was deceived; and he &s;oon had the
mortification to find that the King him&s;elf was coming up with a &s;uperior
force to give him battle: the event of the conte&s;t was &s;uch as might have
been expected; the Earl of Lincoln, who commanded for Simnel, was overthrown
and &s;lain in battle, and the impo&s;tor him&s;elf taken pri|&s;oner. Henry
had now an opportunity of &s;hewing the humanity and the greatne&s;s of his
mind: Sim|nel was pardoned, and given a mean employment in the King's kitchen,
and afterwards preferred to be one of his falconers, in which po&s;t he died.
As for the prie&s;t, his in&s;tructor, he was made a pri&s;oner for life.</P>
<P>Things being thus adju&s;ted, we may turn to France, which had long
been the grave of the Engli&s;h, who yet coveted nothing &s;o much as to
continue the war there. Henry had all along perceived the futility of
conque&s;ts upon the con|tinent, conque&s;ts that could produce no other
ad|vantages than military glory: but, while he in|ternally de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch
pernicious triumphs, he was obliged, in order to gain popularity, to
counte|nance them. He therefore often pretended, that he was going to ravi&s;h
his kingdom once more from the u&s;urper, and lay all France in blood; but, in
fact, he had nothing farther from his heart. As far as negotiations and threats
went, he did all that lay in his power to keep the jarring &s;tates of that
kingdom nearly balanced, and con&s;equently feeble; but, as for &s;uccours of
men and money, he too well knew the value of both to exhau&s;t them, in the
manner of his predece&s;&s;ors, upon &s;uch vain projects.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="217"> The parliament, however, was taught to
be|lieve, that he intended &s;omething con&s;iderable a|gain&s;t France; and
they, ever chearful when France was to be oppo&s;ed, furni&s;hed him with the
nece&s;|&s;ary &s;upplies. But money was, at that time, more ea&s;ily granted
than levied in England. A new in|&s;urrection aro&s;e when the &s;upplies came
to be col|lected, and the Earl of Northumberland was kill|ed by the mob of
York&s;hire, while he attempted to enforce obedience to the laws. The mutineers
did not &s;top here; by the advice of one John a Chamber, an incendiary, they
&s;et Sir John Egre|mont at their head, and marched towards London to give the
King battle: the con&s;equence of this ra&s;h &s;tep was the defeat of the
rebels, and the death of John a Chamber, their ring-leader. It was
nece&s;&s;ary to treat this man with rigour, to in|duce a more ready compliance
to the future grants of parliament, and prevent all in&s;urrections on the
&s;ame occa&s;ion; for now people &s;eemed continually more willing to revolt
than to pay their taxes.</P>
<P>One would not have imagined, by the &s;ucce&s;s of Simnel's
impo&s;ture, that it could have produced imitations; but the old Duche&s;s of
Burgundy, &s;i&s;ter to Edward IV, finding the former fraud had de|ceived &s;o
many, was re&s;olved to project a new &s;cheme, with more art and greater
plau&s;ibility. She fir&s;t &s;pread a report, that the young Duke of York,
&s;aid to have been murdered in the Tower, was &s;till alive; and &s;oon a
youth made his appearance that took upon him the title of the Duke of York. The
per&s;on pitched upon to play this part was called Peter Warbeck, the &s;on of
a Flemi&s;h Jew, a youth of a beautiful per&s;on, good under&s;tanding, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omething in his carriage and man|ner far above his birth
or circum&s;tances. The <PB N="215" REF="218"> King of France, ever attentive
to &s;ow the &s;eeds of divi&s;ion in England, received him at his court, and
gave him proper encouragement; but, at the interce&s;&s;ion of Henry,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, upon the pro&s;pect of a peace. Having quitted France,
Per|kin went to &s;eek protection from the Duche&s;s of Burgundy, taking the
greate&s;t care to conceal his former acquaintance. At their fir&s;t meeting,
the Duche&s;s pretended much di&s;plea&s;ure at his a&s;&s;u|rance, in
a&s;&s;uming the title of her nephew; but &s;oon after, as if brought over by
conviction, &s;he owned him for the Duke of York, and gave him a guard
&s;uitable to that dignity. The Engli&s;h, ever ready to revolt, gave credit to
this new im|po&s;ture, and the young man's prudence, conver|&s;ation, and
deportment, &s;erved to confirm what their credulity had began. All that were
di&s;gu&s;t|ed with the King prepared to join him, but par|ticularly tho&s;e
that were formerly Henry's favourites, and had contributed to place him on the
throne, thinking their &s;ervices could never be &s;ufficiently repaid, were
now the chief heads of the con&s;pi|racy. The&s;e were joined by numbers,
&s;ome gree|dy of novelty, &s;ome blindly attached to their leaders, and &s;ome
induced, by their de&s;perate for|tunes, to wi&s;h for a change.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King's enemies were thus combining to involve the
kingdom in its former calamities, he him&s;elf was no le&s;s intent upon
preventing the impending danger. He endeavoured to undeceive the people,
fir&s;t by &s;hewing that the Duke of York was really dead, and by puni&s;hing
his murderers; and next by tracing Perkin, the impo&s;tor, to his primitive
meanne&s;s: the la&s;t of the&s;e projects was not ea&s;ily executed, for
Warbeck's parents and place of abode were &s;o well concealed, that it was 
<PB N="216" REF="219"> almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to come to a knowledge of them
But Henry, at length, won over Sir Robert Clif|ford, who was then accompanying
the impo&s;tor in Flanders, and had been entru&s;ted with his and the
Duche&s;s's &s;ecrets. From Clifford the King learned, not only their
de&s;igns, but the names of the con&s;pirators, and had &s;everal of them
arre&s;t|ed: his former lenity, however, did not exempt him from fre&s;h
ingratitude: he found that the Lord High Chamberlain, brother to the famous
Lord Stanley, who had been lately created Earl of Derby, was among the number
of tho&s;e who now had con&s;pired again&s;t him. Though this nobleman had been
loaded with favours, and was even then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an immen&s;e
fortune; yet, &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, he &s;ought for more, from his
country's calamities. He was therefore arre&s;ted by the King's order, and,
confe&s;&s;ing his crime, was &s;entenced to &s;uffer that death he &s;o
ju&s;tly merited. You have hitherto ob&s;erved how difficult it was to rule the
Engli&s;h at this time; each province &s;eemed de&s;irous of placing &s;ome
particular family upon the throne, and more eagerly took up arms, than
willingly di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to legal &s;ubordina|tion. To mix lenity
with ju&s;tice, upon proper occa&s;ions, required a very nice di&s;cernment:
Hen|ry &s;hewed his judgment in this particular; when|ever a con&s;pirator took
up arms again&s;t him, from a con&s;cientious adherence to principle, and from
a love of the hou&s;e of York, he generally found pardon; but, if the only
motive of his con&s;piring was a love of change, or an illicit de&s;ire to
&s;ub|vert tho&s;e laws by which he was governed, he was then treated with more
&s;everity.</P>
<P>While Warbeck's adherents were thus di&s;ap|pointed in England, he
him&s;elf attempted landing <PB N="217" REF="220"> in Kent, but, being beat off
from that coa&s;t by the inhabitants, he went from thence to Ireland: find|ing
his hopes fru&s;trated there al&s;o, he went next to try his &s;ucce&s;s in
Scotland. Here his fortune be|gan to mend; James III, who was then King of that
country, received him very favourably, ac|knowledged
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> preten&s;ions to be ju&s;t, and
&s;oon after gave him, in marriage, a daughter of the Earl of Huntley, one of
the mo&s;t beautiful and accompli&s;hed ladies of her time. But, not con|tent
with the&s;e in&s;tances of favour, he was re|&s;olved to attempt &s;etting him
upon the throne of England: it was expected, that, upon Perkin's fir&s;t
appearance in that kingdom, all the friends of the hou&s;e of York would ri&s;e
in his favour: upon this ground, therefore, the King of Scotland en|tered the
country with a &s;trong army, and pro|claimed the young adventurer wherever he
went; but, contrary to expectation, he found none to &s;econd his claims; and,
thus di&s;appointed, he again retreated back to Edinburgh, where he con|tinued
to re&s;ide, till, upon the conclu&s;ion of a treaty of peace between the two
kingdoms, he was once more obliged to leave Scotland, and to &s;eek for a new
protector.</P>
<P>Perkin had now, for the &s;pace of five years, continued to alarm
the King; he had been acknow|ledged in France, Flanders, Ireland, and
Scot|land, as lawful heir to the Briti&s;h crown, and had made &s;ome bold
attempts to &s;econd his preten&s;ions. The time, at length, came, that he was
to act the &s;ame character in England which he had per|formed el&s;ewhere with
&s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. Some months before this there had been an in&s;urrection
in Cornwall: the inhabitants of that di&s;tant coun|ty, upon levying the taxes
granted by parliament, <PB N="218" REF="221"> re&s;u&s;ed to contribute to
expences which were de|&s;tined for the defence of an oppo&s;ite part of the
kingdom. Every in&s;urrection now was followed with a project of dethroning the
King; they there|fore marched, with one Flammock, a lawyer; Bo|diley, a
carrier; and Lord Audley, at their head; directly to London, and incamped upon
Black-Heath. The King's forces there &s;urrounded and attacked them; the battle
was bloody, two thou|&s;and of the&s;e poor deluded wretches were killed upon
the &s;pot, and the re&s;t forced to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Lord Audley,
and one or two of their ring-leaders, were executed; but the re&s;t, to the
number of four thou&s;and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed home again in &s;afety. But this
moderation had not the proper effect upon minds too ignorant for gratitude;
they attributed the King's clemency to fear, and, upon returning home, induced
their friends to be|lieve, that the whole kingdom was ready to ri&s;e to
vindicate their quarrel. It was now, therefore, determined to &s;end for Perkin
Warbeck, who was then in Ireland, to put him&s;elf at their head: Perkin did
not he&s;itate to accept their invitation; and, taking upon him the command,
cho&s;e for his privy council one Hern, a broken mercer; Skelton, a taylor; and
A&s;tley, a &s;crivener. He publi&s;hed a proclamation al&s;o again&s;t Henry,
in which he took the title of Richard IV; and, hav|ing drawn together a body of
three thou&s;and men, attempted to &s;torm the city of Exeter, but with|out
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Henry, having received advice of his proceed|ings, &s;aid merrily,
that he &s;hould now have the plea&s;ure of vi&s;iting a per&s;on whom he had
long wi&s;hed to &s;ee, and then took the nece&s;&s;ary mea|&s;ures to oppo&s;e
him. Perkin, on the other hand <PB N="219" REF="222"> &s;eeing that the King
was marching to attack him, lo&s;t all courage, and, in the night, took
&s;anctuary in the mona&s;tery of Bewley. Soon after, upon promi&s;e of a
pardon, he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the King, and was confined in the Tower;
but, e&s;caping from thence, and finding it impractica|ble to get out of the
kingdom, he again took &s;anc|tuary in the mona&s;tery of Bethlem. The Prior of
this hou&s;e gave him up to the King, upon promi&s;e of a pardon; and Perkin
was now a &s;econd time confined in the Tower: but, plotting, even there,
again&s;t the King, he and the Earl of Warwick being convicted of de&s;igns to
kill the keeper of the Tower, and &s;o e&s;cape, they were both put to
death.</P>
<P>There was as yet, in Henry's reign, nothing but plots, trea&s;ons,
in&s;urrections, ingratitude, im|po&s;ture, and puni&s;hments. You have &s;een
&s;everal of the&s;e &s;omentors of trea&s;on brought to ju&s;tice, yet
infinitely greater numbers pardoned; but there was a wide difference between
the puni&s;hments of this, and tho&s;e arbitrary &s;entences of the reigns
preceding: the courts of judicature now &s;at upon every criminal, uninfluenced
by the royal autho|rity; and &s;carce one per&s;on was puni&s;hed for
trea|&s;on, but &s;uch as would, at pre&s;ent, receive the &s;ame rigorous
treatment. A King, who can reign without ever puni&s;hing, is happy; but that
Mo|narch mu&s;t certainly be undone, who, through fear, or ill-timed lenity,
&s;uffers repeated guilt to e&s;cape without notice. When a country becomes
quite illicit, puni&s;hments then, like the loppings in a garden, only &s;erve
to &s;trengthen the &s;tock, and prepare for a new harve&s;t of virtues.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have hitherto only &s;een Henry employed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
rebellion, and bringing the kingdom from a &s;tate of anarchy to ju&s;t
&s;ubordi|nation: let me now exhibit that part of his reign in which he mo&s;t
de&s;erves our admiration, and &s;hew him as the friend of peace, and the
refined politician. Indeed no man loved peace more than he, and much of the
ill-will of his &s;ubjects aro&s;e from his attempts to repre&s;s their
inclination for war. The u&s;ual preface to his treaties was, That, when
Chri&s;t came into the world, peace was &s;ung; and, when he went out of the
world, peace was bequeathed. He had no ambition to extend his power, except
only by treaties, and by wi&s;|dom; by the&s;e he rendered him&s;elf much more
formidable to his neighbours, than his predece&s;&s;ors had done by their
victories. They were formida|ble only to their own &s;ubjects; Henry was
dreaded by rival Kings.</P>
<P>He all along had two points principally in view, one to depre&s;s
the nobility and clergy, and the other to humanize and rai&s;e up the populace.
From the ambition of the former, and the blind dependence of the latter, all
the troubles in for|mer reigns aro&s;e; every nobleman was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
a certain number of &s;ubjects, over whom he had an ab&s;olute power, and, upon
every occa&s;ion, could influence numbers to join in revolt and
di&s;|obedience.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t, therefore, con&s;idered, that giving the&s;e petty
Monarchs a power of &s;elling their e&s;tates, which before they had not a
right to do, would greatly weaken their intere&s;t. With this view he 
<PB N="221" REF="224"> got an act pa&s;&s;ed, in which the nobility were
granted a power of alienating their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; a law infinitely
plea&s;ing to the commons, nor was it di&s;agreeable even to the nobility,
&s;ince they thus had an immediate re&s;ource for &s;upplying the wa&s;te of
prodigality and the demands of their creditors. The blow reached their
po&s;terity alone, but they were too ignorant to be &s;en&s;ible of remote
&s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>His next &s;cheme was to prevent their giving li|veries to many
hundreds of dependents, who &s;erv|ed, like &s;tanding forces, to be ready at
the &s;um|mons of their lord. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in his reign, none but
menial &s;ervants were permitted to wear a livery, under &s;evere penalties;
and this law he took care to enforce with the utmo&s;t rigour. It is told us,
by Bacon, that the King, one day paying a vi&s;it to the Earl of Oxford, was
entertained, by him with all po&s;&s;ible &s;plendor and magnificence. When the
King was ready to depart, he &s;aw ranged, upon both &s;ides, a great number of
men, dre&s;&s;ed up in very rich liveries, apparently to do him honour. The
King, &s;urprized at &s;uch a num|ber of dome&s;tics, as he thought them, cried
out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>What, my Lord of Oxford, are all the&s;e fine
fellows your menial &s;ervants?</HI></Q> The Earl, not perceiving the King's
drift, an&s;wered, with a &s;mile, that they were only men whom he kept in pay
to do him honour upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. At this the King &s;tarted a little,
and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>By my faith, my Lord, I thank you for your good
chear, but I mu&s;t not &s;uffer to have the laws broken: my Attorney-General
mu&s;t talk with you.</HI></Q> The hi&s;torian adds, that the King ex|acted a
&s;evere fine for this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ta|tute.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="225"> It has been already ob&s;erved what a
perverted u&s;e was made of mona&s;teries, and other places appro|priated to
religious wor&s;hip, by the number of cri|minals who took refuge in them. This
privilege the clergy a&s;&s;umed as their undoubted right; and tho&s;e places
of pretended &s;anctity were become the abode of murderers, robbers, and
con&s;pirators. Witches and necromancers were the only per&s;ons who could not
avail them&s;elves of the advantages of the &s;ecurity the&s;e afforded: they
who&s;e crimes were only fictitious, were the only people who had not the
benefit of &s;uch a retreat. Henry u&s;ed all his intere&s;t with the Pope to
aboli&s;h the&s;e &s;anctuaries, but without effect; all that he could procure
was, that, if thieves, murderers, or robbers, regi&s;tered as &s;anctuary-men,
&s;hould &s;ally out and commit fre&s;h offences, and retreat again, in &s;uch
ca&s;es they might be taken out of the &s;anctuary, and de|livered up to
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Henry politically pretended the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to all
the Pope's decrees, and &s;hewed the greate&s;t re&s;pect to the clergy, but
&s;till was guided by them in no &s;ingle in&s;tance of his conduct. The Pope,
at one time, was &s;o far impo&s;ed upon by his &s;eeming attachment to the
church, that he even invited him to renew the cru&s;ades for recovering the
Holy Land. Henry's an&s;wer de&s;erves to be remembered: He a&s;&s;ured his
Holine&s;s, that no Prince in Chri&s;tendom would be more forward than he to
undertake &s;o glorious and nece&s;&s;ary an expedition; but, as his cominions
lay very di&s;tant from Con&s;tantinople, it would be better to apply to the
Kings of France and Spain for their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and that, in the mean
time, he would come to their aid him&s;elf, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>as &s;oon as all the differences be|tween the
Chri&s;tian Princes were brought to an end.</HI></Q> <PB N="223" REF="226">
This was, at once, a polite refu&s;al and an oblique reproach.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;een the fatal con&s;equences of having favourites, and
therefore re&s;olved to have none; he even excluded, from his privy council,
all &s;uch as, by their titles or fortune, might attempt to go|vern him
in&s;tead of executing his intentions. His council was compo&s;ed of private
men, who had learning and wi&s;dom to advi&s;e, but neither influence nor
ambition to govern.</P>
<P>But, while he was thus employed in lowering his nobility and clergy,
he was u&s;ing every art to extend the privileges of the people. In former
reigns they were &s;ure to &s;uffer, on whatever &s;ide they fought, if they
had the misfortune to lo&s;e the victory: this rendered each party de&s;perate,
in ca&s;es of civil war; and this was the cau&s;e of &s;uch terrible
&s;laughters. He therefore procured the pa&s;&s;|ing of an act, by which it was
e&s;tabli&s;hed, that no per&s;on &s;hould be impeached or attainted for
a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the King <HI>for the time being,</HI> or, in other words, him
who &s;hould be then actually on the throne. This excellent &s;tatute &s;erved
to repre&s;s the de&s;ire of civil war, as &s;everal would naturally take arms
in defence of that &s;ide on which they were certain of lo&s;ing nothing by a
defeat, and their numbers, would intimidate in&s;urgents.</P>
<P>But his greate&s;t efforts were directed to promote trade and
commerce, becau&s;e this naturally intro|duced a &s;pirit of liberty among the
people, and di&s;engaged them from their dependence on the no|bility. Before
this happy aera, all our towns owed their original to &s;ome &s;trong ca&s;tle
in the neigh|bourhood, where &s;ome great lord generally re&s;ided; and the&s;e
al&s;o were made u&s;e of as pri&s;ons for all <PB N="224" REF="227"> &s;orts
of criminals. In this al&s;o there was gene|rally a garri&s;on, or a number of
armed men, who depended on the nobleman's bounty for &s;upport. The number of
the&s;e, of cour&s;e, drew all the ar|tificers, victuallers, and
&s;hop-keepers, to &s;ettle in &s;ome place adjacent, in order to furni&s;h the
lord and his attendants with what nece&s;&s;aries they wanted. The farmers
al&s;o and hu&s;bandmen, in the neighbourhood, built their hou&s;es there, to
be protected again&s;t the numerous gangs of robbers that hid in the woods by
day, and infe&s;ted the country by night, who were called Robert&s;men. Henry,
on the other hand, endeavoured to bring the towns from &s;uch a neighbourhood,
by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial &s;ituation. He attempted to
teach them frugality and pay|ment of debts, the life and &s;oul of indu&s;try,
by his own example; and never omitted the rights of commerce in all his
treaties with foreign Princes.</P>
<P>About this time the whole world &s;eemed to im|prove: Sweden,
France, and Spain, enjoyed ex|cellent Monarchs, who encouraged and protected
the ri&s;ing arts. The Portugue&s;e had &s;ailed round the Cape of Good Hope,
and Columbus had made the di&s;covery of America. Henry, in imitation of them,
gave a patent to &s;ome Bri&s;tol and Por|tugue&s;e merchants to go in que&s;t
of new coun|tries. But an accident gave him a better oppor|tunity of improving
commerce, than his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could have a&s;pired to: the King of
Spain and his Queen, being upon their return to their own dominions, after the
conclu&s;ion of a &s;ucce&s;sful war in Holland, were driven, by a &s;torm,
upon the coa&s;ts of England. As &s;oon as Henry had notice of their arrival,
he received them both with marks of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip 
<PB N="225" REF="228"> and re&s;pect, meditating, in the mean time, how to make
his &s;ubjects reap &s;ome advantage from the accident. He therefore treated
them with a &s;plen|dor which was by no means agreeable to his own nature; and,
while he kept them thus entertained with a round of pageantry and amu&s;ements,
he concluded a treaty of commerce, which has, even to this day, continued to be
beneficial to his po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>He now, at length, &s;aw his country civilized; the people paid
their taxes without in&s;urrections; the nobility learned a ju&s;t
&s;ubordination; the laws alone were &s;uffered to pa&s;s &s;entence; towns
began to &s;eparate from the ca&s;tles of the nobility; com|merce every day
increa&s;ed; foreigners either feared England, or &s;ought its alliance, and
the &s;pirit of faction was happily extingui&s;hed at home. He was at peace
with all Europe, and he had i&s;&s;ued out a general pardon to his own
&s;ubjects. It was in this &s;ituation of things that he died of the gout in
his &s;tomach, having lived fifty-two years and reigned twenty-three. Since the
times of Alfred, England had not &s;een &s;uch another King. He rendered his
&s;ubjects powerful and happy, and wrought a greater change in his kingdom,
than it was po&s;&s;ible to expect could be effected in &s;o &s;hort a time. If
he had any fault, it was, that, having begun his reign with oeconomy, as he
grew old, his de&s;ires &s;eemed to change their object, from the u&s;e of
money, to the plea&s;ure of hoarding it; but we can ea&s;ily him, as he only
&s;aved for the public, the royal coffers being then the on|ly trea&s;ury of
the &s;tate; and, in proportion to the King's &s;inances, the public might be
&s;aid to be either rich or indigent.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER did Prince come to the throne with a conjuncture of &s;o many
fortunate circum|&s;tances in his favour as Henry VIII, who now took upon him
the government of the kingdom. His prudent father left him a peaceable kingdom,
prudent mini&s;ters, and a well &s;tored trea&s;ury. All factions were
extingui&s;hed, and all divi&s;ions united
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n his per&s;on: he by the father's
&s;ide claimed from the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, and by the mother's from the
hou&s;e of York. He was at peace with all Europe, and his &s;ubjects were every
day growing more powerful and more wealthy: commerce and arts had been
introduced in the former reign, and they &s;eemed to find in England a
favourable re|ception. The young King him&s;elf was beautiful in per&s;on,
expert in polite exerci&s;es, and loved by his &s;ubjects. The old King, who
was him&s;elf a &s;cholar, had him in&s;tructed in all the learning of the
times, &s;o that he was perfectly ver&s;ed in &s;chool divinity at the age of
eighteen.</P>
<P>Yet, from this beginning, you mu&s;t not expect to read the
hi&s;tory of a good Prince. All the&s;e advantages were either the gifts of
nature, of fortune, or of his father; with all the&s;e happy talents, Henry
VIII. wanted the two great re|qui&s;ites in forming every good character;
wi&s;dom and virtue. The learning he had, if it might be called by that name,
&s;erved only to inflame his pride, but not controul his vicious affections.
The love of his &s;ubjects was te&s;tified by their adulations, and &s;erved as
another meteor to lead him a&s;tray. His va&s;t wealth, in&s;tead of relieving
his &s;ubjects, or increa&s;ing his power, only contributed to &s;up|ply 
<PB N="227" REF="230"> his debaucheries, or gratify the rapacity of the
mini&s;ters of his plea&s;ures. But happy for him, had his faults re&s;ted
here: he was a tyrant; humanity takes the alarm at his cruelty, and, whatever
for|tunate events might have been the con&s;equence of his de&s;igns, no good
man but mu&s;t revolt at the means he took for their accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of inju&s;tice which marked his reign, was his
pro&s;ecution of Emp&s;on and Dudley, the Judges whom his father had
con&s;tituted to inquire into ca&s;es of trea&s;on, and levy fines
proportionable to the offence. Their conduct was examined, but, nothing being
found again&s;t them that could amount to a capital conviction, a fal&s;e
accu&s;ation was pro|duced, and they were convicted of having plotted again&s;t
the new King, and received &s;entence to be beheaded, which was executed
accordingly.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Judges had been long hated by the people, though
apparently without cau&s;e; they only put the laws in execution again&s;t
criminals, and, in&s;tead of their lives, deprived the guilty of their
fortunes. This action of an unju&s;t compli|ance with popular clamour was
followed by ano|ther &s;till more detrimental to the nation, yet more
plea&s;ing to the people: the &s;pirit of chivalry and conque&s;t was not yet
quite extingui&s;hed in the na|tion; France was &s;till an object of de&s;ire,
and Henry was re&s;olved once more to &s;trike
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the crown. It was in vain that
one of his old pru|dent coun&s;ellors objected, that conque&s;ts on the
continent would only be prejudicial to the king|dom, and that England, from its
&s;ituation, was not de&s;tined for exten&s;ive empire; the young King, deaf to
all remon&s;trances, and perhaps in&s;pired by the voice of the people,
re&s;olved to lead an army into that kingdom. The con&s;equence of the
cam|paign <PB N="228" REF="231"> was an u&s;ele&s;s victory and an empty
triumph. The French fled without fighting; a truce was concluded between the
two Kings, and Henry re|turned home to di&s;&s;ipate, in more peaceful follies,
the large &s;ums which had been ama&s;&s;ed for very different purpo&s;es by
his father.</P>
<P>But, while he thus changed from one plea&s;ure to another, it was
requi&s;ite to find out a mini&s;ter and favourite, who would take care of the
kingdom. Indifferent Princes ever attempt to rule, and are ruled by favourites,
and &s;oon a proper per&s;on was found to an&s;wer the King's intentions in
this particular: the man I mean was the famous Car|dinal Wol&s;ey; and, as a
great part of this reign was <HI>ruled</HI> by him, his hi&s;tory may, with
propriety, make a part in that of his ma&s;ter. Thomas Wol|&s;ey was the &s;on
of a private gentleman (and not of a butcher, as is commonly reported) in
Ip&s;wich: he was &s;ent to Oxford &s;o early, that he was a bachelor at
fourteen, and from that time called the boy bachelor. He ro&s;e, by degrees,
upon quitting college, from one preferment to another, till he was made rector
of Lymington by the Mar|quis of Dor&s;et, who&s;e children he had in&s;tructed.
He had not long re&s;ided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> this
living, when one of the ju&s;tices of the peace put him in the &s;tocks, for
being drunk and rai&s;ing di&s;turbances in a neigh|bouring
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">air. This di&s;grace, however, did
not retard his promotion; he ro&s;e, by degrees, till he was, at la&s;t,
entru&s;ted with negotiating an intend|ed marriage between Henry VII. and
Margaret of Savoy. His di&s;patch, upon that occa&s;ion, pro|cured him the
deanery of Lincoln; and in this &s;ituation it was that Henry VIII. pitched
upon him as a favourite, and entru&s;ted him with the ad|mini&s;tration of
affairs. Pre&s;ently after his being <PB N="229" REF="232"> introduced at court
he was made a Privy Coun&s;ellor, and, as &s;uch, had an opportunity of
ingratiating him&s;elf with the King, who found him at once &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
and enterprizing. Wol&s;ey &s;ung, laugh|ed, danced, with every libertine of
the court; and his hou&s;e was the &s;cene of all the King's criminal
plea&s;ures and amours. To &s;uch a weak and vi|cious Monarch as Henry,
qualities of this nature were highly plea&s;ing, and Wol&s;ey was made his
Prime Mini&s;ter, and managed the whole kingdom at his plea&s;ure. The people
&s;aw, with indigna|tion, the new favourite's mean conde&s;cen&s;ions to the
King, and his arrogance to them&s;elves. They had long regarded the vicious
in&s;olence and unbe|coming &s;plendor of the clergy with envy and
dete&s;tation, and Wol&s;ey's greatne&s;s &s;erved to bring a new odium upon
that body, already too much the object of the people's di&s;like.</P>
<P>Wol&s;ey had &s;ome talents as a mini&s;ter, but his failings
outbalanced them, being exce&s;&s;ively re|vengeful, ambitious, and intolerably
proud. Among other in&s;tances of his ambition, he a&s;pired at the Popedom.
Ferdinand, who was then Emperor of Germany, promi&s;ed him his intere&s;t to
procure it, and this con&s;equently attached the Engli&s;h mini|&s;ter more
clo&s;ely to the Emperor: this Monarch was then at war with France, and each
power &s;o|licited the alliance of England. It was the inte|re&s;t of the
Engli&s;h calmly to look on as &s;pectators of the quarrel, and &s;uffer its
rivals in power to grow weak by their mutual animo&s;ity: Wol&s;ey, however,
preferring his own intere&s;t to that of his country or his ma&s;ter, engaged
in a league again&s;t France. Soon after, however, the Pope dying, and the
Emperor failing in his promi&s;e, Wol&s;ey, <PB N="230" REF="233"> in revenge,
induced his ma&s;ter to change &s;ides, and a&s;&s;i&s;t France again&s;t
Ferdinand.</P>
<P>A victory over the Scots, rather o&s;tentatious than u&s;eful,
&s;erved, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to repre&s;s the di&s;contents of the people
during this mal-ad|mini&s;tration of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical favourite: this
vic|tory was obtained by the Earl of Surrey over James IV. of Scotland; it was
fought at Flodden Field, and the Scots lo&s;t, upon this occa&s;ion, the flower
of their nobility and gentry, and James, their King, was &s;lain in
batttle.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s ever &s;erves to &s;top the murmurings of the Engli&s;h,
and no nation can better endure to be &s;plendidly mi&s;erable. Wol&s;ey now
became a Cardinal, grew every day more powerful, and more de&s;irous of power;
the Pope was &s;en&s;ible of his influence over the King, and therefore created
him his legate in England. The Pontiff's de&s;ign was to make him thus
in&s;trumental in draining the kingdom of money, upon pretence of employ|ing it
in a war again&s;t the Turks, but, in reality, to fill his own coffers. In this
he &s;o well &s;erved the court of Rome, that he, &s;ome time after, made him
legate for life: he was now, therefore, at once a Legate, a Cardinal, a
Bi&s;hop, a Prime Mini&s;ter, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of numberle&s;s church
be|nefices; yet, &s;till un&s;atisfied, he de&s;ired greater promotions. He
therefore procured a bull from the Pope, impowering him to make Knights and
Counts, to legitimate ba&s;tards, to give degrees in arts, law, phy&s;ic, and
divinity, and grant all &s;orts of di&s;pen&s;ations. So much pride and power
could not avoid giving high offence to the nobility, yet none dared to vent
their indignation, &s;o greatly were they in terror of his vindictive temper.
The Duke of Buckingham, &s;on of him who lo&s;t <PB N="231" REF="234"> his life
in the reign of Richard III, was the only per&s;on who had re&s;olution enough
to complain. His threats were &s;oon conveyed to Wol&s;ey by an informer, who
was not &s;low to accu&s;e the Duke of high trea&s;on. The &s;ub&s;tance of his
impeach|ment was, that he had con&s;ulted a fortune-teller concerning his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and had affected to make him&s;elf popular. This
was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a noble|man, who&s;e father had
died in defence of the late King: however, he was condemned to die as a
traitor. When the &s;entence was pronouncing a|gain&s;t him, and the High
Steward came to men|tion the word traitor, the unhappy pri&s;oner could no
longer contain: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>My Lords,</HI> cried he to his Judges, <HI>I am
no traitor; and, for what you have now done again&s;t me, take my &s;incere
forgivene&s;s; as for my life, I think it not worth petitioning for; may God
for|give you, and pity me.</HI></Q> He was &s;oon after executed on
Tower-hill.</P>
<P>Every ju&s;t man mu&s;t feel the highe&s;t indignation at &s;o
unmerited a puni&s;hment. In the former reign, the few that peri&s;hed under
the hand of the executioner were really culpable; but here we &s;ee a
nobleman's life taken away, only for his di&s;like to an a&s;piring and
licentious up&s;tart. It is this cruelty of puni&s;hing without guilt, and not
the number of executions in a reign, that di&s;tingui&s;hes it into tyrannical
or merciful: perhaps there were more executions under Henry VII, than his
&s;ucce&s;|&s;or; and yet the fir&s;t was a ju&s;t and merciful Prince, the
latter an arbitrary and mercile&s;s tyrant.</P>
<P>By this time all the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of the late King were
quite exhau&s;ted on empty pageants, guilty plea&s;ures, or vain treaties and
expeditions. Wol&s;ey was a proper in&s;trument to &s;upply the King 
<PB N="232" REF="235"> with money, which now began to be wanted; this he
extorted by the name of a benevolence: Henry minded not by what methods it was
rai&s;ed, provided he had but the enjoyment of it. How|ever, his mini&s;ter met
&s;ome oppo&s;ition in his at|tempts to levy tho&s;e involuntary contributions:
having exacted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy from the clergy, he next
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Hou&s;e of Commons, but they only granted half
the &s;upplies he demanded. The Cardinal was highly offended at their
par&s;imony, and de&s;ired to be heard in the hou&s;e; but, as this would have
de&s;troyed the very form and con&s;titution of that augu&s;t body, they
replied, that none could be admitted to rea&s;on there but &s;uch as were
members. This was the fir&s;t attempt made, in the pre&s;ent reign, to render
the King ma&s;ter of the debates in parliament; Wol&s;ey fir&s;t paved the way,
and, unfortunately for the kingdom, the King too well improved up|on his
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Wol&s;ey was, &s;oon after, rai&s;ed to &s;till greater dignities
than before: he was, at once, Archbi&s;hop of York, Bi&s;hop of Durham, Abbot
of St. Alban's, a Cardinal, Legate for life, Lord Chancellor of Eng|land, Prime
Mini&s;ter, and favourite, and care&s;&s;|ed or feared by all the powers of
Europe: he now, therefore, undertook more openly to render the King independent
of his parliament, and levied the &s;ub&s;idy granted by them for four years,
and con&s;equently to be paid at four different times, all at once. Again&s;t
this the poor, who were the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, mo&s;t loudly exclaimed;
but he di&s;regarded their clamours, &s;ecure in the King's approbation and the
Pope's protection.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings only paved the way to &s;till greater
extortions: Wol&s;ey was too haughty to <PB N="233" REF="236"> be refu&s;ed in
his demands by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and determined to levy money upon the
King's authority alone. This was deemed a breach of the Magna Charta, and the
people ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed to comply, even a general rebellion threaten|ed
to en&s;ue: the King, finding what were likely to be the con&s;equences of the
Cardinal's precipi|tate mea&s;ures, pretended that they were carried on without
his authority; but, at the &s;ame time, demanded from the people a benevolence,
which was only an artifice to extort money, under a dif|ferent name. The people
&s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the King's art, and the citizens of London refu&s;ed
to give the benevolence demanded: their example was followed by the country,
and an univer&s;al de|fection &s;eemed to prevail. The King, apprehen|&s;ive of
bad con&s;equences, by per&s;i&s;ting in his de|mand, thought proper to
retract, for this time, and wait a more favourable opportunity of
op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You now find the people labouring under a very different form of
oppre&s;&s;ion from that in the reigns preceding Henry VII. In tho&s;e earlier
times their mi&s;eries chiefly aro&s;e from the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the
nobility; in this reign they proceeded from the u&s;urpations of the King.
Before Henry VII. had balanced the government, the people often di&s;|charged
their taxes by an in&s;urrection; but now, that the pre&s;ent Henry had
de&s;troyed that balance again, the people were obliged to pay taxes that were
not due. In &s;hort, they now &s;eemed as mi|&s;erable as when their great
re&s;torer had brought them from anarchy: an arbitrary King, an ava|ricious
Pope, a revengeful favourite, a luxurious clergy, all con&s;pired to harra&s;s
them: yet, during this whole reign, there was no rebellion; not from 
<PB N="234" REF="237"> the ju&s;tice of the King's admini&s;tration, nor from
the love the people had to their Sovereign; but, hap|pily for the reigning
tyrant, he enjoyed the effects of his predece&s;&s;or's prudence, not his
own.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>AS, in a family, the faults and the imperti|nence of &s;ervants are
often to be a&s;cribed to their ma&s;ters; &s;o, in a &s;tate, the vices and
the in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ence of favourites &s;hould
ju&s;tly be attributed to the King who employs them. The pride of Wol|&s;ey was
gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t, but his riches were &s;till
greater; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r to have a pretext for ama&s;&s;ing
&s;uch &s;ums, he undertook to found two new colleges at Oxford, for which he
received every day fre&s;h grants from the Pope and the King. To execute his
&s;cheme he obtained a liberty of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;e|veral mona&s;teries,
and converting their funds to the benefit of his intended &s;cheme. Whatever
might have been the Pope's inducement to grant him the&s;e privileges, nothing
could be more fatal to the Pontiff's intere&s;ts; for Henry was thus him|&s;elf
taught to imitate afterwards what he had &s;een a &s;ubject perform without
crime or danger.</P>
<P>Hitherto the admini&s;tration of affairs was car|ried on by Wol&s;ey
alone; as for the King, he lo&s;t in the embraces of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es all
the complaints of the nation, and the Cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant,
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rder to maintain his own
authori|ty. But now a period approached that was to put an end to this
mini&s;ter's exorbitant power: one of the mo&s;t extraordinary and important
revolutions that ever employed the attention of man, was now ripe for
execution. But, to have a clear idea of this <PB N="235" REF="238"> grand
reformation, it will be proper to take a cur|&s;ory view of the &s;tate of the
church at that time, and ob&s;erve by what &s;eemingly contradictory means
Providence produces the happie&s;t events.</P>
<P>The church of Rome had now, for more than a thou&s;and years, been
corrupting the &s;acred doc|trines of Chri&s;tianity, and converting into a
tem|porality the kingdom of another world. The Popes were frequently found at
the head of their own armies, fighting for their dominions with the arm of
fle&s;h, and forgetting, in cruelty and im|moral politics, all the pretended
&s;anctity of their character. They drained other kingdoms of their trea&s;ures
upon the mo&s;t infamous pretexts, and were proud of &s;etting at Rome, in
their own con|duct, an example of refined plea&s;ure and &s;tudied luxury. The
cardinals, prelates, and dignitaries of the church lived and were &s;erved like
voluptu|ous Princes, and &s;ome of them were found to po&s;|&s;e&s;s eight or
nine bi&s;hoprics at a time. Wherever the church governs, it exerts its power
with cruelty; and to their luxury the&s;e great ones added the crime of being
tyrants too.</P>
<P>As for the inferior clergy, both Popi&s;h and Pro|te&s;tant writers
exclaim again&s;t their di&s;&s;olute and abandoned morals. They publicly kept
mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and bequeathed to their ba&s;tards whatever they were able to
&s;ave from their plea&s;ures, or extort from the poor. There is &s;till to be
&s;een, &s;ays a fine writer, a will made by a Bi&s;hop of Cambray, in which he
&s;ets a&s;ide a certain &s;um 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>for the ba&s;tards he has had already, and
tho&s;e which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be may yet happen to have.</HI></Q>
In many parts of England and Germany the people obliged the prie&s;ts to have
concubines, &s;o that the laity might keep their wives in greater &s;ecurity;
while the <PB N="236" REF="239"> poor laborious pea&s;ant and artizan &s;aw all
the fruits of their toil go, not to clothe and maintain their own little
families, but to pamper men who in&s;ult|ed and de&s;pi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>But the vices of the clergy were not greater than their ignorance;
few of them knew the meaning of their own Latin ma&s;s; they were chiefly
employed in finding out witches, and exorci&s;ing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but,
what mo&s;t encrea&s;ed the hatred of the people again&s;t them, was the
&s;elling pardons and ab&s;olu|tions for &s;in at certain &s;tated prices. A
deacon, or &s;ubdeacon, who &s;hould commit murder, was ab|&s;olved from his
crime, and allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s three benefices, upon paying twenty crowns.
A Bi&s;hop or an Abbot might commit murder for ten pounds. Every crime had its
&s;tated price, and ab&s;olutions were given, not only for &s;ins already
committed, but for &s;uch as &s;hould be committed hereafter. The wi&s;e&s;t of
the people looked with &s;ilent dete&s;|tation on the&s;e impo&s;itions, and
the ignorant, whom nature &s;eemed to have formed for &s;lavery, began to open
their eyes to &s;uch glaring ab&s;urdi|ties.</P>
<P>There aro&s;e, at la&s;t, a champion to re&s;cue hu|man nature from
its degeneracy. This was the famous Martin Luther. Leo X, being em|ployed in
building the church of St. Peter's at Rome, in the year 1519, in order to
procure mo|ney for carrying on this project, he gave a commi&s;|&s;ion for
&s;elling indulgences, or, in other words, a deliverance from the pains of
purgatory, either for one's &s;elf or their friends. There were every-where
&s;hops opened, where the&s;e were &s;old; but, in general, they were to be had
at taverns and &s;uch-like places. The&s;e indulgences were granted to the
Do|minican friars to be di&s;tributed by them, whereas <PB N="237" REF="240">
the Augu&s;tine friars had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on of the di&s;tribution of
them time out of mind before. Martin Luther was an Augu&s;tine Monk, and one of
tho&s;e who re&s;ented this transferring the &s;ale of indulgences to another
order. He began to &s;hew his indignation, by preaching again&s;t their
efficacy: oppo&s;ition &s;oon drove him farther than he at fir&s;t intended to
go, and, now the veil was lifted, he proceeded to examine the authority of the
Pope him&s;elf. The people, who had long groaned un|der the Papal tyranny,
heard his di&s;cour&s;es with plea&s;ure, and defended him again&s;t the
authority and machinations of the church of Rome. Fre|deric, Elector of Saxony,
&s;urnamed the Wi&s;e, openly protected him. Luther as openly declaimed
again&s;t the number of &s;acraments, reducing the &s;e|ven held by the church
of Rome, fir&s;t to three, and afterwards to two: from thence he proceeded to
examine the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, to &s;hew the folly of
&s;uppo&s;ing a purgatory, and the dan|gerous con&s;equence of celibacy among
the clergy.</P>
<P>The Pope i&s;&s;ued out his bulls again&s;t Luther, and the
Dominican friars procured his books to be burned. Luther abu&s;ed the
Dominicans, and bold|ly, in the &s;treets of Wirtemberg, burned the bull of the
Pope. In the mean time the di&s;pute was carried on by writings on either
&s;ide: Luther, though oppo&s;ed by the Pope, the Cardinals, and all the body
of the clergy, &s;upported his cau&s;e &s;ingly and with &s;ucce&s;s. If indeed
we look into his works at this day, we &s;hall find them trifling and
un&s;atisfactory enough; but then he had only ignorance to contend with, and,
ill as he wrote, they an&s;wered &s;till wor&s;e. Opinions are inculcated upon
the minds of the public; rather by fortitude and per&s;everance than by
&s;trength of rea&s;oning or <PB N="238" REF="241"> beauty of thought, and no
man had more forti|tude and more per&s;everance than he.</P>
<P>In this di&s;pute it was the fate of Henry VIII. to be one of the
champions. His father, who had given him the education of a &s;cholar,
per|mitted him to be in&s;tructed in &s;chool divinity, which then compo&s;ed
the learning of the times. He was, therefore, willing to give the world a
demon&s;tra|tion of his abilities in this re&s;pect, and de&s;ired the Pope's
permi&s;&s;ion to read the works of Luther, which had been forbidden to be read
under pain of excommunication. Having readily obtained this reque&s;t, the
King, from St. Thomas Aquinas, defended the &s;even &s;acraments, and &s;hewed
&s;ome &s;kill in &s;chool divinity, tho' it is thought that Wol|&s;ey had the
chief hand in directing him. A book being thus fini&s;hed in ha&s;te, it was
&s;ent to Rome for the Pope's approbation: the Pope, ravi&s;hed with its
eloquence and depth, compared the work to that of St. Augu&s;tine or St.
Jerome, and gave Henry the title of <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> little
&s;u&s;|pecting that Henry was &s;oon going to be one of the mo&s;t terrible
enemies that ever the church of Rome had yet experienced</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e cau&s;es which contributed to render the Romi&s;h
church odious or contemptible, there were &s;till others proceeding from
political motives. Clement V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">I. had
&s;ucceeded Leo, and, the heredi|tary animo&s;ity between the Emperor and the
Pope breaking out into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Clement
was taken pri|&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, and, with thirteen Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">inals be&s;ide, kept in cu&s;tody for
his ran&s;om. As the demands of the Emperor were exorbitant, Henry undertook to
negotiate for the Pope, and procured a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reaty in his favour; but his
Holine&s;s, in the mean time, corrupting his guards, <PB N="239" REF="242"> had
the good fortune to e&s;cape from confinement, and left the treaty
unfini&s;hed, but &s;ent H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> a
letter of thanks for his mediation. The conduct of the Emperor &s;hewed Henry
that the Pope might be injured with impunity; and the behaviour of the Pope
manife&s;ted but little of that &s;anctity or infallibility to which the
Pontiffs pretended. Be|&s;ides, as he had obliged the Pope, he &s;uppo&s;ed
that he might, upon any emergency, expect a return of favour.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ituation of the church and of the Pope, that a new
drama was going to be perform|ed, which was to change the whole &s;y&s;tem of
Eu|rope. Henry had now been married eighteen years to Catharine of Arragon, who
had been brought over from Spain to marry his elder brother, Prince Arthur, who
died &s;ome months after his co-habi|tation with her: Henry had three children
by this lady, one of whom was &s;till living, while &s;he her|&s;elf was
e&s;teemed for her virtue and the gentlene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition. The
King, tho' he felt no real pa&s;&s;ion, either for the qualifications of her
mind or per&s;on, yet for a long time broke out into no fla|grant contempt; he
ranged from beauty to beauty in the court, and his title and authority always
pro|cured him a ready compliance from female frailty. It happened, at length,
that among the maids of honour that then attended the Queen, was one Anna
Bullen, the daughter of a gentleman of di&s;tinction, tho' not of the nobility.
Her beauty &s;urpa&s;&s;ed what had hitherto appeared at this vo|luptuous
court; her features were regular, mild, and attractive; her &s;tature elegant,
though below the middle &s;ize; while her wit and vivacity even exceeded the
allurements of her per&s;on. The King, who never re&s;trained one pa&s;&s;ion
which he <PB N="240" REF="243"> de&s;ired to gratify, &s;aw, and loved her;
but, after &s;everal efforts to induce her to comply with his criminal
pa&s;&s;ion, he found that without marriage he could have no hopes of
&s;ucceeding. This ob|&s;tacle, therefore, he quickly undertook to remove; his
own Queen was now become hateful to him, and, in order to procure a divorce, he
pretended that his con&s;cience rebuked him, for having &s;o long lived in
ince&s;t with his pre&s;ent Queen, formerly his brother's wife. This every
per&s;on of candour &s;aw was only a pretext to cover his real motive; he
him&s;elf had eagerly &s;olicited the match with Queen Catharine; he had lived
with her eighteen years without any &s;cruple, and had the Pope's li|cence for
this cohabitation; but he a&s;&s;erted, that a wounded con&s;cience was his
motive, and none of his &s;ubjects offered to divulge the real one.</P>
<P>In this perplexity, therefore, he applied to Cle|ment VII, who owed
him obligations, and from whom he expected a ready compliance, to di&s;&s;olve
the bull of the former Pope, who had given him permi&s;&s;ion to marry
Catharine, and to declare that it was contrary to all laws, both divine and
human. Clement was now in the utmo&s;t perplexity, Queen Catharine was aunt to
the Emperor who had late|ly made him a pri&s;oner, and who&s;e re&s;entment he
dreaded to rekindle, by thus injuring &s;o near a re|lation; be&s;ide, he could
not, in honour, declare the bull of a former Pope illicit, for this would be
entirely de&s;troying papal infallibility. On the other hand, Henry was his
protector and friend; the dominions of England were the chief re&s;ource of his
finances, and the King of France, &s;ome time before, had got a bull of divorce
in &s;omewhat &s;i|milar circum&s;tances. In this exigence he thought the
be&s;t method was to &s;pin out the affair by a ne|gotiation; 
<PB N="241" REF="244"> and thus he argued, temporized, pro|mi&s;ed, recanted,
and di&s;puted, hoping that the King's pa&s;&s;ion would never hold out during
the te|dious cour&s;e of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;y. In this he was
mi&s;taken; Henry had been taught to argue as well as he, and quickly found, or
wre&s;t|ed, many texts of &s;cripture to favour his opinions and his
pa&s;&s;ion. To his arguments he added threats, which probably had greater
influence: the Pope was a&s;&s;ured that the Engli&s;h were already but too
much di&s;po&s;ed to withdraw their obedience from the Holy See, and that, if
he continued to refu&s;e, the whole country would readily follow their
Mo|narch's example, and exclude them&s;elves from his protection. The King even
propo&s;ed to his Ho|line&s;s, whether, if he was denied the putting away his
pre&s;ent Queen, he might not have a di&s;pen&s;a|tion to marry two wives at a
time? The Pope, though his mea&s;ures were already taken not to grant the bull,
yet &s;till &s;eemed unre&s;olved, as if waiting for more full and authentic
information.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;olicitations, on which Henry's happine&s;s
&s;eemed to depend, he expected, in his favourite Wol&s;ey, a warm defender and
a &s;teady adherent; but, in this, he was deceived. Wol&s;ey &s;eemed to be in
pretty much &s;uch a dilemma as the Pope him&s;elf. On the one hand he was to
plea&s;e his ma&s;ter the King, from whom he had re|ceived a thou&s;and marks
of favour: on the other hand he could not di&s;oblige the Pope, who&s;e
&s;er|vant he more immediately was, and who had power to puni&s;h his
di&s;obedience: in this dilemma he cho&s;e to &s;tand neuter; though, of all
mankind, he was mo&s;t haughty, on this occa&s;ion he gave way in all things,
to his colleague Cardinal Cam|pegio, &s;ent by the Pope from Italy. Wol&s;ey's 
<PB N="242" REF="245"> method of temporizing highly di&s;gu&s;ted the King, yet
he endeavoured to conceal his re&s;entment: he now only looked out for &s;ome
man of equal abili|ties and le&s;s art, and it was not long till accident threw
in his way one Thomas Cranmer, of greater abilities than the former, and rather
more integrity. Cranmer was a Doctor of Divinity and a Profe&s;&s;or at
Cambridge, but had lo&s;t his place upon mar|rying contrary to the in&s;titutes
of the canon law, which enjoined him celibacy. He had travelled into Germany,
where he read Luther's works, and embraced his doctrine; and, upon his return,
was tutor to the &s;ons of a gentleman, who one night happened to entertain two
of the principal men of the court: Cranmer, being a&s;ked his opinion of the
King's divorce, which was then the topic of the conver&s;ation, delivered
him&s;elf in &s;o learned a manner, that the King was &s;oon informed of his
abilities, and ordered him to follow the court.</P>
<P>The King's re&s;entment now appeared more openly again&s;t the
Cardinal. The Attorney-ge|neral was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment
again&s;t him, and &s;oon after he him&s;elf was order|dered to re&s;ign the
great &s;eal. Crimes are readily found again&s;t a man when he is hated, and
the Cardinal was &s;entenced to be excluded from the protection of the laws. As
&s;oon as he was out|lawed, the King commanded him to retire to a
country-hou&s;e, and directed that an inventory of his goods &s;hould be taken,
which contained im|men&s;e riches, acquired by various methods of guilt and
extortion: of fine holland alone there were found in his hou&s;e a thou&s;and
pieces, which may &s;erve to give an idea of the re&s;t of his wealth. The
parliament confirmed the &s;entence of the courts, and he was &s;ent an exile
to his country <PB N="243" REF="246"> &s;eat, there to await the King's
di&s;po&s;al of his per|&s;on, with all the fluctuations of hope and
appre|hen&s;ion. Still, however, he was left the arch|bi&s;hopric of York, and,
even &s;hattered as his for|tunes were, he was re&s;olved to perform the
cere|mony of his in&s;talment there with a magnificence little &s;uitable to
his pre&s;ent condition: but, while he was preparing to enjoy, in this retreat,
tho&s;e &s;plendors which he ever loved, by another unex|pected revolution, he
was at the King's command arre&s;ted by the Earl of Northumberland for high
trea&s;on. He at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to comply, as being a Cardinal; but, finding
the Earl bent upon perform|ing his commi&s;&s;ion, he complied, and &s;et out,
by ea&s;y journies, for London, to appear as a criminal in a place where he
formerly acted as a King. In his way he &s;tayed a fortnight at the Earl of
Shrew&s;bu|ry's, where one day at dinner he was taken ill, not without violent
&s;u&s;picions of having poi&s;oned him|&s;elf: being brought forward from
thence, with much difficulty he reached Leice&s;ter abbey, where, the Monks
coming out to receive him, he &s;aid, Father Abbot, I am come to lay my bones
among you: as his di&s;order increa&s;ed, an officer being placed near his
bed-&s;ide at once to guard and attend him, he cried out to him, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>O, if I had &s;erved my God as I have &s;erved
my King, he would not thus have for&s;aken me in adver&s;ity.</HI></Q> He died
&s;oon after, in all the pangs of repentance and remor&s;e, and left a life
which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition, till he found that all his
ambition was but vanity at the la&s;t. He left two natural children behind him,
one of whom being a prie&s;t, was loaded with church preferments. Henry, being
thus freed from a per&s;on whom he con&s;idered as an ob&s;tacle to his
intentions, by the advice of Cranmer had the legality of his pre&s;ent 
<PB N="244" REF="247"> marriage canva&s;&s;ed in the different univer&s;ities
of Europe. It was very extraordinary to &s;ee the King on one &s;ide
&s;oliciting the univer&s;ities to be favourable to his pa&s;&s;ion, and on the
other the Emperor pre&s;&s;ing them to incline to his aunt: Henry liberally
rewarded tho&s;e Doctors who de|clared in his favour, and the Emperor granted
be|nefices to &s;uch as voted on his &s;ide of the debate. Time has
di&s;covered the&s;e intrigues; in one of Henry's account-books we find the
di&s;bur&s;ements he made upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; to a deacon he gave a
crown, to a &s;ubdeacon two crowns, and &s;o of the re&s;t, to each in
proportion to his con|&s;equence. The per&s;on who bribed on the&s;e
oc|ca&s;ions, however, excu&s;ed him&s;elf by declaring, that he never paid the
money till after the vote was given. Henry at length prevailed; his
li|beralities were greater than tho&s;e of his rival, as he was mo&s;t
intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of the de|bate: all the colleges of Italy and
France una|nimou&s;ly declared his pre&s;ent marriage again&s;t all law, divine
and human, and that therefore it was not at fir&s;t in the power of the Pope to
grant a di&s;pen&s;ation. The only places where it was mo&s;t warmly oppo&s;ed,
were at Cambridge and Oxford; the&s;e univer&s;ities, it &s;eems, had, even
then, more freedom and integrity than were to be found el&s;e-where, but at
la&s;t they al&s;o concurred in the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>The agents of Henry were not content with the &s;uffrages of the
univer&s;ities; the opinions of the Rabbi's were al&s;o demanded; but they were
ea&s;ily bought up in his favour. Thus fortified, the King was re&s;olved to
oppo&s;e even the Pope him&s;elf, for his pa&s;&s;ion by no means could brook
the delays and &s;ubterfuges of the Holy See: being, <PB N="245" REF="248">
therefore, &s;upported by his clergy, and authori&s;ed by the univer&s;ities;
having &s;een the Pope former|ly degraded by a lay Monarch, and Luther's
doc|trine followed by thou&s;ands; and yet, &s;till further in&s;tigated by the
King of France, he, without fur|ther di&s;pen&s;ation, annulled his marriage
with Queen Catharine, and Cranmer, now become an Arch|bi&s;hop, pronounced the
decree.</P>
<P>The Queen, during this conte&s;t, always &s;up|ported her rights
with re&s;olution, and yet with mode&s;ty: at length, however, having found the
inutility of further re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he retired to the country, without once
offering to complain: &s;he &s;aw the power of her rival, and yielded without
murmuring. Anna Bullen had already con&s;ented to marry the King, and even
&s;hared his bed two months before his marriage with Catharine was
di&s;&s;olved. Though her prudence and her virtue demanded e&s;teem in the
former parts of her con|duct, yet &s;he now for a moment forgot the ties of
each, and gave a loo&s;e to her triumph. She pa&s;&s;ed through London with a
magnificence greater than had ever been known before; the &s;treets were
&s;trewed, the walls were hung, the conduits ran with wine, while &s;he and her
corpulent lover rode through the city like the heroine and knight of a
romance.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Pope now thought him&s;elf obliged to hold no
mea&s;ures with the King; and, being al&s;o frighted by the menaces of the
Emperor, publi&s;hed a &s;entence, declaring Queen Catharine alone to be
Henry's lawful wife, and requiring him to take her again, with a denunciation
of cen|&s;ures in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. When Henry received news of the
&s;entence given again&s;t him at Rome, he was convinced that no mea&s;ures
could be kept <PB N="246" REF="249"> with the Holy See, and therefore no longer
delay|ed to execute his long meditated &s;cheme of &s;epa|rating entirely from
the church of Rome. The parliament was at his devotion; a part of the cler|gy
was for him, as they had already declared a|gain&s;t the Pope, when they
decreed in favour of the divorce; the people were flattered with the
expectation of being rid of the burden of their taxes; and &s;uch as were
di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee Italian Bi&s;hops hold Engli&s;h church preferments,
expect|ed their downfall: in &s;hort, all things con&s;pired to co-operate with
his de&s;igns; he, therefore, at once ordered him&s;elf to be declared, by his
clergy, head of the church. The parliament confirmed his title, and aboli&s;hed
all the authority of the Pope in England, the tribute of Peter-pence, and the
collation to eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. The peo|ple came into the King's
project with joy, and took an oath, called the oath of &s;upremacy; all the
credit of the Pope, that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for ages, was now at once
overthrown, and few, ex|cept tho&s;e who held to the religious hou&s;es,
&s;eem|ed di&s;&s;atisfied. They who believed that it would have been dangerous
to break with the Pope, were now convinced that it could be effected with
im|punity; and it was &s;oon perceived, that all autho|rity, which is not
&s;upported by power, is nothing but an empty name.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner began the reformation in Eng|land, and by &s;uch
&s;urpri&s;ing methods Provi|dence brought about its de&s;igns, as if to mock
hu|man &s;agacity. Let us now pur&s;ue its progre&s;s, and follow this
capricious Monarch through his various projects, cruelties, and
incon&s;i&s;tencies. The parliament were now entirely dependant up|on the King;
they had, from the beginning, &s;ided with him in his &s;eparating from the
church of Rome, and con&s;equently were now obliged to comply with all his
other mea&s;ures, in order to &s;trengthen the new reformation.</P>
<P>Henry was very &s;en&s;ible that the parliament was now, even from
motives of intere&s;t, entirely de|devoted to him, and therefore he was
re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the opportunity, and render him|&s;elf ab&s;olute.
He therefore oppo&s;ed the parlia|ment again&s;t the monks, and availed
him&s;elf of the hatred which that body incurred by their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion:
the parliament at fir&s;t began by exa|mining the abu&s;es practi&s;ed in
mona&s;teries, and, finding &s;ome, condemned all: but, while they were
employed in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them, Henry was bu&s;y in de&s;troying the power
of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ors. This was the origin of the unlimitted power he now
a&s;&s;umed; his parliament, at different times, pa&s;&s;ed every &s;tatute he
thought proper to propo&s;e, how ab&s;urd &s;oever; and many of them were, in
fact, marked with the highe&s;t ab&s;urdities. They te&s;tified their
&s;atisfaction, not only for what he had done, but al&s;o for whatever he
intended to do. They enacted, that the &s;ame obedience &s;hould be paid to the
King's proclamation as to an act of <PB N="248" REF="251"> parliament, which
was de&s;troying all their power at one blow; they declared their readine&s;s
to be|lieve, not only what had been directed, but what|ever the King &s;hould
direct, in matters of religion, for the future: but, to crown all, they enacted
that the King &s;hould not pay his debts, and that &s;uch as had been paid by
him, &s;hould refund the money.</P>
<P>Being thus impowered to act as he thought proper, he went
vigorou&s;ly to work in the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries, colleges, and
religious hou&s;es. Cambridge and Oxford, without any re|gard to their
antiquity, &s;hared the &s;ame fate with the re&s;t, and the lectures were, for
a time, di&s;con|tinued, and the revenues confi&s;cated. To recon|cile the
people to the&s;e proceedings, Henry took care to have the counter&s;eit
reliques expo&s;ed, the &s;candalous lives of the friars and nuns made pub|lic,
and all their debaucheries detected. What|ever had &s;erved to engage the
people in &s;uper&s;ti|tion, was publicly burnt; but what grieved the people
mo&s;t to &s;ee, were, the bones of Thomas Becket, the &s;aint of Canterbury,
treated with the &s;ame &s;everity, burnt in public, and his rich &s;hrine, in
which there was a diamond of great value, con|fi&s;cated among the common
plunder. The people looked on with &s;ilent horror, afraid to rebel, equal|ly
dete&s;ting the vices of the monks and the impiety of the King.</P>
<P>But, while the King had entirely &s;eparated him|&s;elf from Rome,
yet he was by no means willing to be a follower of Luther. The invocation of
&s;aints was not yet aboli&s;hed by him, but only re|&s;trained: he ordered the
Bible to be tran&s;lated into the vulgar tongue, but not put into the hands of
the laity. It was a capital crime to believe in the <PB N="249" REF="252">
Pope's &s;upremacy, and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed religion, as
practi&s;ed in Germany. His opinions upon religion were delivered in a law,
which, from its horrid con&s;equences, was termed <HI>the Bloody Statute;</HI>
by which it was ordained, that whoever, by word or writing, denied
tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, that whoever maintained the communion in both kinds
was nece&s;&s;ary, or that it was law|ful for prie&s;ts to marry, or that vows
of cha&s;tity could innocently be broken, or that private ma&s;&s;es were
unprofitable, or that auricular confe&s;&s;ion was unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be
burnt or hanged as the court &s;hould determine.</P>
<P>The kingdom, at that time, was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure divided between
the followers of Luther and the adherents to the Pope; this &s;tatute, with his
former decrees, in &s;ome mea&s;ure excluded both, and therefore opened a wide
field for per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;ecutions, however, were preceded by one of a different
nature, ari&s;ing neither from re|ligious nor political cau&s;es, but
tyrannical caprice. Anna Bullen, his Queen, was her&s;elf of the Lu|theran
per&s;ua&s;ion, and had &s;ecretly favoured that party: the&s;e attachments
&s;oon created her enemies, who only waited &s;ome favourable occa&s;ion to
de|&s;tory her credit with the King, and that occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf
but too &s;oon. The King's pa&s;&s;ion was, by this time, quite exhau&s;ted;
the only de|&s;ire he ever had for her was that brutal appetite which enjoyment
&s;oon de&s;troys; he was fallen in love, once more, if we may call it love,
with Jane Seymour, a maid of honour to the Queen.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Queen's enemies perceived the King's di&s;gu&s;t,
they &s;oon gave him an opportunity to gratify his inclinations, by accu&s;ing
her of &s;un|dry intrigues with her dome&s;tics; which accu&s;ation 
<PB N="250" REF="253"> was eagerly caught up by the King. All his pa&s;|&s;ions
were in extreme; he immediately flew to par|liament, and had her accu&s;ed of
adultery and in|ce&s;t with her own brother. This parliament, who had long
&s;hewn them&s;elves the timid mini&s;ters of all his pa&s;&s;ions, condemned
the Queen and her brother, without ever knowing on what foundation the
&s;entence was grounded.</P>
<P>Her brother, Lord Rochfort, was beheaded, though there was not the
lea&s;t proof of his guilt: one Norris and Brereton were hanged for only having
paid her &s;uch compliments, as would now merdy pa&s;s for gallantry and
innocent amu&s;ement: Smeton, a mu&s;ician, was compelled to acknow|ledge his
having received favours from her, and he was then hanged without an opportunity
of being confronted by the Queen.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch &s;light &s;u&s;picions was this unhappy Queen &s;ent to
the Tower, in order to await the execution of her &s;entence. She who had been
once the envied object of royal favour, was now going to give a new in&s;tance
of the capriciou&s;|ne&s;s of fortune: &s;he was ever of a chearful
di&s;|po&s;ition, and her ea&s;y levities perhaps di&s;gu&s;t|ed the gloomy
tyrant. She had di&s;tributed, in the la&s;t year of her life, not le&s;s than
fifteen thou|&s;and pounds among the poor, and was at once their protector and
darling. Upon being conduct|ed to her pri&s;on, &s;he &s;at down to addre&s;s
the King, by letter, for mercy: in this &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon her innocence
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>You have rai&s;ed me,</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
<HI>from privacy to make me a lady; from a lady you made me a Counte&s;s, from
a Counte&s;s a Queen, and from a Queen I &s;hall &s;hortly become a
&s;aint.</HI></Q> On the morning of her execution &s;he &s;ent for Mr.
King&s;ton, the keeper of the Tower, to whom, <PB N="251" REF="254"> upon
entering her pri&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Mr. King&s;ton, I hear I am not to die till
noon, and I am &s;orry for it, for I thought to be dead before this time, and
free from a life of pain.</HI></Q> The keeper attempting to comfort her by
a&s;&s;uring her the pain would be very little, &s;he replied, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I have heard the executioner is very
expert;</HI> and, cla&s;ping her neck with her hands, laughing, <HI>and I have
but a little neck.</HI></Q> King&s;ton, who gives this account, continues to
ob&s;erve, that he had &s;een many men and women executed, but never one
who&s;e fortitude was equal to her's. She was beheaded &s;oon after, behaving
with the utmo&s;t de|cency and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Anna Bullen &s;eemed to be guilty of no other crime than that of
having &s;urvived the King's af|fection: many crowned heads had already been
put to death in England, but this was the fir&s;t royal execution upon a
&s;caffold. Henry ordered his parliament to give him a divorce, between her
&s;entence and execution, thus to ba&s;tardize Eliza|beth, the only child he
had by her, as he had al|ready ba&s;tardized Mary, his only child by Queen
Catharine.</P>
<P>The very next day after her execution he mar|ried Jane Seymour, who
died the year following, after having been delivered of a &s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time the fires of Smithfield be|gan to blaze: tho&s;e
who adhered to the Pope, or they who followed Luther, were equally the ob|jects
of royal vengeance and eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;e|cution. Thomas Cromwell,
rai&s;ed by the King's caprice from a black&s;mith's &s;on to be a royal
fa|vourite (for tyrants ever rai&s;e their favourites from the lowe&s;t of the
people) and Cranmer, now be|come Archbi&s;hop of Cauterbury, with all their
might, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the reformation. Bi&s;hop Gardiner <PB N="252" REF="255">
and the Duke of Norfolk, on the other hand, were for leading the King back to
his former &s;u|per&s;titions, with every art; and Cromwell fell a &s;acrifice
to their intrigues, but the Duke and Bi&s;hop did not &s;ucceed. Unhappily for
his &s;ub|jects, the King became an equal per&s;ecutor of the two religions
propo&s;ed for his acceptance.</P>
<P>It was now that England &s;aw a &s;pectacle to &s;trike the
bolde&s;t with horror; a company of peo|ple condemned and executed all
together, &s;ome for being &s;tedfa&s;t to the Pope, and others for ad|hering
to Luther: among this number were Dr. Robert Barnes, Thomas Gerard, and William
Je|rom, for being Lutherans; Buttolph, Danepli&s;s, Philpot, and Brinholm, for
continuing to acknow|ledge the Pope. The&s;e were all burnt together, without
ever being permitted to plead their own cau&s;e, or even to know their crimes
or their ac|cu&s;ers. The people in the North, indeed, during the&s;e times of
cruelty, ventured to ri&s;e in rebel|lion, but by the means of the Duke of
Norfolk they were &s;oon brought to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions Henry contracted a new marriage with
Anne of Cleves, being induced by her picture, in which it &s;eems the painter
had flattered her. He found her very different from what his pa&s;&s;ion had
expected, but married her from political motives. He could not, however, long
bear the unea&s;ine&s;s of being married for life to a woman, who&s;e
corpulence, it &s;eems, gave him di&s;gu&s;t: he therefore re&s;olved to have
once more a divorce from his parliament, which he found it no difficult matter
to obtain. Among other rea&s;ons to cancel his e&s;pou&s;als, he declared, that
he had not given an inward con&s;ent to the marriage, without which it was
affirmed that his <PB N="253" REF="256"> promi&s;es could not be obligatory: he
added, that, as he was re&s;olved not to con&s;ummate the mar|riage, and to
have legitimate i&s;&s;ue, &s;o it was pro|per to give him a Queen by whom he
might ac|compli&s;h the&s;e intentions. The&s;e rea&s;ons were thought good;
virtue and ju&s;tice had been long bani&s;hed from the &s;ervile
parliament.</P>
<P>He took, for a fifth wife, Catharine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's
niece: in this match he &s;eemed to be perfectly happy, and even ordered his
confe&s;&s;or to draw up a particular form of thank&s;|giving, for the
ble&s;&s;ings he enjoyed in a faithful wife. The Queen, it &s;eems, pretended
to the &s;ame affection for him: but, alas, his amiable days were long over! he
was now almo&s;t choaked with fat, and had contracted a moro&s;e air, very
improper for in&s;piring affection: the Queen had actually committed tho&s;e
lewdne&s;&s;es before marriage, of which Anna Bullen had formerly been fal&s;ly
ac|cu&s;ed. But tho&s;e crimes did by no means de&s;erve death, nor even a
divorce; &s;ince her fidelity to him, &s;ince marriage, was all that the mo&s;t
&s;cru|pulous delicacy could require: Henry, however, con&s;idered her former
incon&s;tancy as a capital of|fence; and, not yet &s;atiated with blood, this
Queen was executed on Tower-hill. All this was terrible, but &s;till the King
was re&s;olved to be peculiarly cruel: though branded with three di|vorces, and
&s;tained with the blood of two wives, he ordered a law to be enacted, equally
remark|able for its ab&s;urdity and impo&s;&s;ibility, namely, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>That, whatever per&s;on knew of the intrigues of
a Queen, he &s;hould reveal it upon pain of high trea&s;on; or if any woman,
not a virgin, &s;hould pre&s;ume to marry the King of England, &s;he &s;hould
be guilty of high trea&s;on!</HI></Q> One would think that it were
impo&s;&s;ible to procure a <PB N="254" REF="257"> body of men capable of
giving &s;anction to &s;uch in&s;crutable ab&s;urdities, and yet lay claim to
rea&s;on. It was plea&s;antly &s;aid (for even tho&s;e times of &s;laugh|ter
could not &s;uppre&s;s ridicule) that the King, ac|cording to that &s;tatute,
could only marry a widow. His next and la&s;t wife actually was a widow,
Ca|tharine Parr, widow of Lord Latimer; and &s;he was a favourer of the
reformation.</P>
<P>She was, however, to proceed with great cau|tion; the King prided
him&s;elf much on his &s;kill in theology, and it might be fatal to di&s;pute
with him upon religion, as &s;he had &s;een in the ca&s;e of one Lambert,
&s;ome time before. It &s;eems this man had denied tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,
which Henry had ordered to be believed: the King, hearing that he was to be
tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter for this of|fence, which was capital, undertook,
him&s;elf, to di&s;pute the point with him in public. Letters were written to
many of the Bi&s;hops and Nobility to be pre&s;ent upon this extraordinary
occa&s;ion; and, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ay

were invincible. They extolled him above all the divines of the age, and at
once confirmed his pride and his prejudices: the re&s;ult of the argument was,
that Lambert had his choice, either to abj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> his opinions or to be burnt as an ob&s;tinate he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Lambert cho&s;e to die ra|ther than

<PB N="255" REF="258"> their halberds, pu&s;hed it into the flames, where it
was &s;oon con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>It was not without rea&s;on, therefore, that the pre&s;ent Queen
concealed her &s;entiments, and be|haved with caution; upon this account &s;he
dur&s;t not intercede for three Prote&s;tants, who were burnt at Wind&s;or
ju&s;t after her marriage: &s;he once, in|deed, attempted to argue with the
King, but it had like to have co&s;t her her life; wherefore af|terwards &s;he
&s;uffered the divines on each &s;ide to di&s;pute, and the executioner to
de&s;troy. During the&s;e tran&s;actions the King would frequently
a&s;|&s;emble the hou&s;es of parliament, and harangue them with florid
orations, in which he would aver, that never Prince had a greater affection for
his people, or was more beloved by them. In every pau&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e,
&s;ome of his creatures, near his per&s;on, would begin to applaud, and this
was followed by loud acclamations from the re&s;t of the audience.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a&s;toni&s;hing, to what a pitch of cruelty he
attained, and to what a &s;tate of &s;ervi|lity his people: I can account for
either in no other manner, than that religious di&s;putes had now &s;o divided
the people, and &s;et one again&s;t the other, that the King, availing
him&s;elf of the univer&s;al weakne&s;s which was produced by univer&s;al
di&s;&s;en|&s;ion, became the tyrant of all.</P>
<P>But nature, at la&s;t, &s;eemed kindly willing to rid the world of a
mon&s;ter that man was unable to de&s;troy: Henry had been troubled, for &s;ome
time, with a di&s;order in his leg, which was now grown very painful; this,
added to his mon&s;trous corpu|lency, which rendered him unable to &s;tir, made
him more furious than a chained lion: he became froward and untractable, none
dared to approach <PB N="256" REF="259"> him without trembling. He had been
ever &s;tern and &s;evere, he was now outrageous: flattery had corrupted all
his &s;en&s;es; he deemed it an un|pardonable crime to controvert tho&s;e
opinions which he him&s;elf was changing every hour. His courtiers, contending
among them&s;elves, and con|&s;piring the death of each other, had no
inclination to make an enemy of him. Thus he continued, for four years, the
terror of all and the tormentor of him&s;elf: at length his end approached; he
per|ceived he had not long to live, his fat increa&s;ing and his leg growing
wor&s;e. He had already &s;laugh|tered &s;everal favourites, rai&s;ed from
ob&s;cure &s;ta|tions to &s;hare his dignities and his cruelty; More, Fi&s;her,
Cromwell, and others, died upon the &s;caf|fold, and Wol&s;ey prevented it by
his own death: he was re&s;olved to make one victim more before he left the
world, and that was the Duke of Nor|folk, who had formerly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a
rebellion ex|cited again&s;t him, and who had, all along, been the vigilant
mini&s;ter of his commands. This no|bleman had, outwardly, complied with the
refor|mation, but, in his heart, favoured the Pope: the King knew this, and
only wanted a pretext to put him and his &s;on, the Earl of Surry, to death: it
was no difficult matter to find one; the &s;on had u&s;ed the arms of Edward
the Confe&s;&s;or in his e&s;|cutcheon, and the father had left a blank &s;pace
in his own where they might be in&s;erted. This was all the crime alledged
again&s;t them, but it was &s;uf|ficient when the King gave his opinion that it
was his will they &s;hould die. The Earl of Surry was beheaded upon Tower-hill,
and a warrant &s;ent to the Lieutenant of the Tower to cut off the Duke of
Norfolk's head in two days following: this &s;en|tence was ju&s;t upon the
point of being executed, <PB N="257" REF="260"> when the King's own death gave
him an unex|pected reprieve. Henry had been &s;uffered to lan|gui&s;h without
any of his dome&s;tics having the cou|rage to warn him of his approaching end;
they who had ever come near him with trembling, now dreaded to give him this
friendly admonition. At length Sir Anthony Denny had the charity to in|form him
of his &s;ituation: he thanked this cour|tier for his friendly admonition, and
&s;oon after expired, full of &s;orrow for his former guilt, and with all the
horrors of approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Some Sovereigns have been tyrants from con|tradiction and revolt;
&s;ome from being mi&s;led by favourites, and &s;ome from a &s;pirit of party;
but Henry was cruel from di&s;po&s;ition alone, cruel in the government, cruel
in religion, and cruel in his family: yet, tyrant as he was, he died peace|ably
a natural death, while Henry VI, the mo&s;t harmle&s;s of all Monarchs, was
dethroned, im|pri&s;oned, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. It is a folly and a
wickedne&s;s to &s;ay, that good or bad actions are their own recompence here:
true is the doctrine of holy writ, The wicked have their good things in this
life, the virtuous mu&s;t look for them in another.</P>
<P>Our divines have taken much pains to vindicate the character of this
vicious Prince, as if his con|duct and our reformation were, in fact, united:
nothing can be more ab&s;urd than this, as if the mo&s;t noble de&s;igns were
not often brought about by the mo&s;t vicious in&s;truments; we &s;ee even the
cruelty and inju&s;tice of man employed in our holy redemption.</P>

<P>THE alterations, in the reign of Henry, were rather &s;eparations
from the Pope than a re|formation of religious abu&s;es: in the reign of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or Edward VI, his &s;on by Jane Seymour, and heir to the crown,
the errors of Rome, in reality, began to be reformed. This Prince was but nine
years old when he a&s;cended the throne of his father, and the hi&s;tory of his
government is rather a detail of the methods pur&s;ued by his go|vernors to
reform the abu&s;es of religion, than a &s;eries of politics or war; and their
characters, ra|ther than his, &s;hould be the object of the hi&s;torian's
re&s;earch.</P>
<P>The Duke of Somer&s;et was made Protector of the minority, and thus
engro&s;&s;ed the whole admi|ni&s;tration; the re&s;t of the council, which
were joined with him, either &s;ided with his views, or ineffectually oppo&s;ed
them. To &s;trengthen his power, he marched again&s;t the Scots who had
in|vaded England, their con&s;tant practice whenever they &s;aw the country
employed in faction and di&s;|pute: a &s;light victory, gained by him upon this
occa&s;ion, acquired him popularity and power. I have more than once remarked,
that, to gain the hearts of the Engli&s;h, it was requi&s;ite to be a
con|queror. But to this character Somer&s;et added vir|tues of a much more
amiable kind: he was hum|ble, civil, affable, courteous to the meane&s;t
&s;uitor, and all the actions of his life were directed by mo|tives of religion
and honour: he, at the &s;ame time, had learned to look with contempt and
dete&s;tation on the errors and corruptions of the church of Rome, and was
con&s;equently the warm friend of Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, who now undertook to
make <PB N="259" REF="262"> a real reformation, which Henry VIII. only
pre|tended to do.</P>
<P>You have &s;een, in Henry's reign, that the only alterations he made
in religion, were &s;uch as either favoured his pa&s;&s;ions or increa&s;ed his
power. Thus all his &s;ubjects were under a peculiar re&s;traint, which, upon
his death, was no longer continued: each took the liberty of &s;peaking his
thoughts up|on religion, though the laws of the la&s;t reign were &s;till in
force. In this divi&s;ion of opinions, as it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, the
Reformers prevailed, for they had the Protector of their party: to that and,
therefore, they procured a general vi&s;itation of churches, and reformed
numberle&s;s abu&s;es that were almo&s;t held &s;acred by pre&s;cription. It
was left to people's choice to go to confe&s;&s;ion, which had been hitherto
deemed an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, or to neglect that practice. It was ordered,
that all images &s;hould be taken out of churches, prie&s;ts were allowed to
marry, the old ma&s;s was aboli&s;hed, and a new liturgy drawn up, which
retrenched &s;everal abu&s;es in the &s;ervice of the church, and which is the
&s;ame with that now u&s;ed, bating a few alterations.</P>
<P>The&s;e reformations were evidently calculated for the benefit of
the &s;ubject; but &s;till the Popi&s;h clergy, who either were expelled their
mona&s;te|ries or had refu&s;ed to conform, &s;tirred up the people to ri&s;e
in rebellion again&s;t them: we may judge, from the number of places in which
in&s;ur|rections were made, that tho&s;e reformations were by no means received
with univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. There were, at once, in&s;urrections in
Wilt&s;hire, Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp&s;hire, Kent, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Suf|folk,
Warwick&s;hire, E&s;&s;ex, Hertford&s;hire, Leice&s;|ter&s;hire,
Rutland&s;hire, and Worce&s;ter&s;hire; and the flames of war were rekindling
through the <PB N="260" REF="263"> whole kingdom. The Protector, who both by
principle and intere&s;t was a friend of the popu|lace, did every thing to
redre&s;s their grievances, and by that means &s;topped their fury for a while,
In fact, they had &s;everal complaints that were founded in ju&s;tice: the
nobility had become po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of the forfeited lands which belonged
to the clergy, and, in&s;tead of leaving them to be culti|vated by the poor, as
formerly, inclo&s;ed them for the purpo&s;es of plea&s;ure or magnificence.
This nece&s;&s;arily drove numbers, be&s;ides the ejected friars, to the
utmo&s;t &s;treights; but, to add to their mi&s;|fortunes, an act was
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them, the mo&s;t &s;evere that had hitherto been known in
England: it was enacted, that, if any per&s;on &s;hould loiter, without
offering him&s;elf to work, for three days together, he &s;hould be adjudged a
&s;lave for two years to the fir&s;t informer, and &s;hould be marked on the
brea&s;t with the letter V, or <HI>vagabond,</HI> im|printed with an hot iron.
It is not to be wonder|ed at, therefore, that there &s;hould be a general
in|&s;urrection of the people, when &s;uffering &s;uch &s;e|vere
oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But all the Protector's promi&s;es and endeavours could not
effectually redre&s;s their grievances, he therefore was obliged to have
recour&s;e to violence. The&s;e were not the compact bodies of men that we have
&s;een in former rebellions, headed by &s;ome di&s;contented or ambitious
courtier, and led on with conduct and &s;ucce&s;s: Henry VII. had effec|tually
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed all &s;uch; the&s;e were now only a tumultuous rabble; without
arms and without di&s;|cipline, led on by &s;ome ob&s;cure de&s;perado;
un|rea&s;onable in their demands, and divided among each other; the unhappy
wretches were therefore ea&s;ily overthrown. Above a thou&s;and of them 
<PB N="261" REF="264"> were &s;lain near Exeter by Lord Ru&s;&s;el, and two
thou&s;and more near Norwich by the Earl of War|wick.</P>
<P>The kingdom was now again inclining to an ari&s;tocracy: the
nobility, by the late increa&s;e of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, were grown
powerful, and op|pre&s;&s;ed the people at plea&s;ure. They now began to find
that they had a &s;eparate intere&s;t from that of the commons, and con&s;pired
to carry on their power by union among them&s;elves, while the re&s;t of the
kingdom was divided. The Duke of Somer&s;et, however, oppo&s;ed this project,
as he was ever a fa|vourer of the people; and it was incumbent there|fore to
de&s;troy his power before they could e&s;ta|bli&s;h their own. With this view
they placed the Earl of Warwick, afterwards made Duke of Nor|thumberland, at
their head, and began by &s;pread|ing reports to de&s;troy the Protector's
reputation; they next won over the common council of Lon|don to favour their
projects, and la&s;tly had him accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on. The intere&s;t of
the Pro|tector was overpowered by that of his rival: he was condemned, and
lo&s;t his head upon Tower-hill.</P>
<P>In all this &s;truggle for power, the young King, by rea&s;on of his
age, was barely pa&s;&s;ive: he was only made the executor of the re&s;entment
and am|bition of the contending mini&s;ters, as either hap|pened to prevail;
and at one time &s;igned the order for execution on this &s;ide, at another
time on that, but ever with tears in his eyes; a tenderne&s;s of
di&s;po&s;ition was one of this amiable youth's con&s;pi|cuous qualities: to
the&s;e were added a &s;agacity far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing his years and learning,
that amazed all &s;uch as happened to conver&s;e with him. When the dignity of
the throne was to be &s;upported, he <PB N="262" REF="265"> behaved like a man;
and, at other times, was gentle and affable as became his age. In &s;hort, he
had &s;uch great qualities, or was &s;aid to have &s;uch, that mankind had
rea&s;on to lament his &s;hort continuance among them. It is very probable,
however, that flattery would have contributed to de&s;troy tho&s;e talents, as
it had tho&s;e of his father; for few Princes, except his father, had received
more flattery than he. He died of a defluxion upon his lungs, his death being
ha&s;tened by medicines given by a woman who confidently pretended &s;he could
cure him. His death made way for another &s;cene of horrid barbarity, in which
the kingdom was to be ruled by a weak and bigotted woman, who was her&s;elf
ruled by mercile&s;s prie&s;ts, who received their orders from the court of
Rome.</P>

<P>YOU have hitherto &s;een the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of
England, partly obtained by lineal de&s;cent, and partly by the aptitude for
govern|ment in the per&s;on cho&s;en: neither wholly here|ditary, nor quite
elective, it has ever made ance&s;|try the pretext of right, but, in fact, the
people &s;ued for the &s;upport of the&s;e preten&s;ions. And this is the
be&s;t &s;pecies of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that can be con|ceived: it prevents that
ari&s;tocracy, which is ever the re&s;ult of a government entirely elective;
and that tyranny which is too often e&s;tabli&s;hed where there is never an
infringement upon hereditary claims.</P>
<P>Whenever a Monarch of England happened to be arbitrary, he generally
con&s;idered the kingdom as his property, and not him&s;elf as a &s;ervant of 
<PB N="263" REF="266"> the kingdom. In &s;uch ca&s;es it was natural for him,
at his decea&s;e, to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper: Henry, in
conformity to this practice, made a will, in which he &s;ettled the
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion merely according to his u&s;ual caprice; Edward VI. was
fir&s;t nominated to &s;ucceed him, who&s;e reign you have ju&s;t &s;een; then
Mary, his elde&s;t daughter by Catharine of Spain, but with a mark of &s;pecial
conde&s;cen&s;ion, by which he would intimate her illegitimacy; the next that
followed was Elizabeth, his daughter by Anna Bullen, with the &s;ame marks of
her not being legitimate: after his own children his &s;i&s;ter's children were
men|tioned; his younger &s;i&s;ter the Duche&s;s of Suffolk's i&s;&s;ue were
preferred before his elder &s;i&s;ter the Queen of Scotland's, which preference
was thought by all to be neither founded in ju&s;tice nor &s;upported by
rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Edward VI, as has been &s;een, &s;ucceeded him. He al&s;o made a
will, in which he gave the kingdom away from Mary and Elizabeth to the
Duche&s;s of Suffolk's daughter, the lady Jane Grey, a girl of &s;ixteen. By
the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions there were, after the death of young Edward, no le&s;s
than four Prince&s;&s;es who could lay claim to the crown: Mary, who was
fir&s;t upon the will, had been de|clared illegitimate by parliament, and that
act was never repealed; the &s;ame could be alledged again&s;t Elizabeth, but
&s;he had another foundation by be|ing re&s;tored to her rights in her father's
reign; the Queen of Scotland, Henry's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, could plead the
illegitimacy of his two daughters; and Jane Grey might alledge the will of the
la&s;t King in her favour.</P>
<P>You have &s;een, in the la&s;t reign, the Earl of Warwick
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;urrection of the people, afterwards becoming a
favourite of the King, then <PB N="264" REF="267"> made Duke of Northumberland,
next overturning the Duke of Somer&s;et his rival, and at length pur&s;uing the
mea&s;ures of the man whom he had de&s;troyed. This nobleman's ambition did not
re&s;t here; he had hopes of &s;ecuring the crown in his own family, and, with
this view, he matched the lord Guilford Dudley, his &s;on, with lady Jane Grey,
whom, by his intere&s;t, he hoped to &s;ettle on the throne. He was hated by
the people for his cruelties as much as the young lady was loved for her
virtues, and this was the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to his de&s;ign. I have been
more prolix than u&s;ual upon this topic of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but you
&s;hould attend to it with care, in order to have a clear idea of the pre&s;ent
and the &s;ucceeding reigns.</P>
<P>Immediately upon the death of the young King, but two competitors
put up for the crown. Mary, relying upon the ju&s;tice of her preten|&s;ions;
and Jane Grey, &s;upported by the Duke of Northumberland, her father-in-law.
Mary was &s;trongly bigotted to the Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, having been
bred up in re&s;traint: &s;he was re&s;erved and gloomy; &s;he had, even during
the life of her fa|ther, the re&s;olution to maintain her &s;entiments and
ceremonies, and refu&s;ed to comply with his new in&s;titutions: her zeal had
rendered her cruel, and &s;he was not only blindly attached to her reli|gious
opinions, but even to the Popi&s;h clergy who maintained them. On the other
hand, Jane Grey was attached to the Reformers; though yet but &s;ix|teen, her
judgment had attained &s;uch a degree of perfection as few enjoy in their more
advanced age. All hi&s;torians agree, that the &s;olidity of her
under|&s;tanding, improved by continual application, ren|dered her the wonder
of her age. A&s;cham, tutor to Elizabeth, informs us, that, coming once to 
<PB N="265" REF="268"> wait upon her at her father's hou&s;e in
Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, he found her reading Plato's works in Greek, when all the
re&s;t of the family were hunting in the park. He &s;eemed &s;urprized at her
being the only per&s;on ab&s;ent from the diver&s;ions abroad, but &s;he
a&s;&s;ured him, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that Plato was an higher amu&s;ement to her than
the mo&s;t &s;tudied refinements of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure.</HI></Q> It was
philo&s;ophy, and not ambition, which &s;he &s;eemed born for: when her
ambitious father-in-law came to inform her of her advancement to the throne,
&s;he heard the news with &s;orrow, and ac|cepted the proffered honour with
reluctance. How|ever, the intreaties of her friends, and the autho|rity of her
hu&s;band, at length reconciled her to her fortune; &s;he was removed to the
Tower, and &s;oon after proclaimed at London, while the people &s;hewed few of
tho&s;e marks of &s;atisfaction which u&s;ually accompany a ceremony of this
kind.</P>
<P>Jane was proclaimed by the council, but the people were for Mary.
The men of Suffolk ro&s;e in her favour, Norfolk &s;oon joined her, and Lord
Ha&s;tings, with four thou&s;and men which were rai&s;ed to oppo&s;e her,
revolted to her &s;ide. It was in vain that the Duke of Northumberland
attempt|ed to lead his army again&s;t them; his &s;oldiers de|&s;erted on the
march, he found him&s;elf abandoned, and &s;oon after the council it&s;elf,
which he once governed, now freed from re&s;traint, declared again&s;t him.
Jane, who had but ju&s;t been crowned, now &s;aw her&s;elf again &s;tripped of
her dignities, and, without any reluctance, laid down an honour which &s;he was
at fir&s;t compelled to accept, and which &s;he held but nine days. Her father,
the Duke of Suffolk, delivered up the Tower, of which he had the command; and
her father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland, being prevent|ed 
<PB N="266" REF="269"> from flying out of the kingdom, pretended to be
plea&s;ed at Mary's &s;ucce&s;s, and was the fir&s;t to fling up his cap when
&s;he was proclaimed in Cam|bridge.</P>
<P>Mary now entered London, and, without the lea&s;t effu&s;ion of
blood, &s;aw her&s;elf joyfully pro|claimed, and peaceably &s;ettled on the
throne. This was a juncture that &s;eemed favourable to Briti&s;h happine&s;s
and liberty; a Queen, who&s;e rights were the mo&s;t equitable, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure elected by the people; the ari&s;tocracy of the la&s;t reign almo&s;t
wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; the hou&s;e of com|mons, by this means, re-in&s;tated
in their former authority; the pride of the clergy humbled, and their vices
detected; together with peace abroad and almo&s;t unanimity at home. This was
the flattering pro&s;pect upon Mary's acce&s;&s;ion, but &s;oon this plea&s;ing
phantom was di&s;&s;olved; Mary was cruel and a bigot; &s;he gave back their
former power to her clergy, and the kingdom was, once more, involved in the
horrors from whence it had lately been extricated.</P>
<P>The Queen had promi&s;ed to the men of Suffolk, who fir&s;t declared
in her favour, that &s;he would &s;uffer religion to remain in the &s;ituation
in which &s;he found it. This promi&s;e, however, &s;he by no means intended to
perform: political cruelty ever precedes religious: &s;he had re&s;olved on a
change of religion; but, before &s;he per&s;ecuted heretics, who were as yet
her friends, it was nece&s;&s;ary to get rid of &s;ome of the late council, who
were, in reality, her enemies. The Duke of Northumber|land was the fir&s;t
object of royal vengeance, and not indeed without rea&s;on. It is in&s;tructive
enough to ob&s;erve the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; the Duke of Norfolk was
now taken from his pri&s;on in the <PB N="267" REF="270"> Tower, to &s;it as
judge upon the Duke of Nor|thumberland, who had kept him there. The ac|cu&s;ed
made a very &s;kilful defence, but what could that avail in a court
predetermined to condemn him? He was capitally convicted and &s;oon after
executed, Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Pal|mer, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his
projects, &s;haring in his puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>While the&s;e were falling as victims to their am|bition, the
Queen's mini&s;ters were, in the mean time, carrying on a negotiation of
marriage be|tween her and Philip, King of Spain. The peo|ple thought they &s;aw
that this would be a fatal blow to their liberties, and therefore loudly
mur|mured again&s;t it; but, when they found the treaty actually concluded,
they could no longer contain. Sir Thomas Wyat, a Roman Catholic, at the head of
four thou&s;and in&s;urgents, marched from Kent to Hyde-Park, and entered the
city in hopes of &s;ecuring the Tower: but his ra&s;hne&s;s undid him; as he
pa&s;&s;ed through the narrow &s;treets, care was taken, by the Earl of
Pembroke, to block up the way behind him, by fortifications thrown a|cro&s;s
the &s;treets; and guards were placed at all the avenues to prevent his return.
This unhappy man pa&s;&s;ed boldly forward, and was now ready to reap the
fruits of his undertaking, when, to his a&s;toni&s;h|ment, he found that he
could neither proceed nor yet make good a retreat. He now, too late, per|ceived
his own temerity, and, lo&s;ing all courage in the exigency, he &s;urrendered
at di&s;cretion. In the mean time the Duke of Suffolk had endeavour|ed to
foment the in&s;urrection, but without &s;ucce&s;s; he was taken pri&s;oner
al&s;o, and de&s;tined for the common &s;laughter. Accordingly, Wyat, the Duke
of Suffolk, Sir John Throgmorton, and fifty|eight <PB N="268" REF="271"> more,
were executed; but what rai&s;ed the compa&s;&s;ion of the people mo&s;t of
all, was the exe|cution of Lady Jane Grey and her hu&s;band Guil|ford Dudley,
who were involved in this calamity.</P>
<P>Two days after Wyat was taken, Lady Jane and her hu&s;band were
ordered to prepare for death: Lady Jane, who had long before &s;een the
threat|ened blow, was no way &s;urprized at the me&s;&s;age, but bore it with
heroic re&s;olution; and, being in|formed that &s;he had three days to prepare
for death, &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;o long a delay. Guilford Dudley
was the fir&s;t that &s;uffered: as the Lady was conducted to execution, the
officers of the Tower met her on the way, bearing the headle&s;s body of her
hu&s;band, &s;treaming with blood, in or|der to be interred in the chapel in
the Tower: &s;he looked on the corp&s;e without trembling, and only, with a
&s;igh, de&s;ired to proceed. She te&s;tified, to the la&s;t moment of her
&s;ufferings, great con&s;tan|cy, great piety, and an immoveable adherence to
the reformation. This was the &s;econd Queen who died by the hands of the
executioner in England.</P>
<P>The enemies of the &s;tate being thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the theatre
was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion. The Queen was freed from
all apprehen&s;ions of an in&s;urrection, and therefore began by a&s;&s;embling
a corrupt parliament, which was to countenance her future cruelties. The
no|bility, who&s;e only religion &s;eemed that of the Prince who governed, were
ea&s;ily gained over, and the hou&s;e of commons &s;eemed pa&s;&s;ive in all
her proceedings. She began by giving orders for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
married Bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts; the ma&s;s was directed to be re&s;tored; the
Pope's au|thority was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, with &s;ome re&s;trictions; the laws
again&s;t heretics were renewed, and the <PB N="269" REF="272"> church and its
privileges put upon the &s;ame foun|dation in which they were before the
alterations of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>This was kindling up the fires of per&s;ecution anew: at the head of
the&s;e mea&s;ures were Gardi|ner, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and Bonner,
Bi&s;hop of London. Poole, the Pope's Legate, a great part of who&s;e life was
&s;pent in Italy, &s;eemed too much civilized in that country, then the mo&s;t
po|lite in Europe, to be acce&s;&s;ory to the mea&s;ures now pur&s;ued.
Gardiner began this bloody &s;cene with Hooper and Rogers: Hooper had been
Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter; Rogers was a clergyman, who had &s;hone among&s;t the
mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the Pro|te&s;tants. He was prebendary of St.
Paul's, and refu&s;ed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the church of Rome, which he
looked upon as antichri&s;tian. They were condemned by commi&s;&s;ioners
appointed by the Queen, the Chancellor at the head of them. Rogers &s;uffered
in Smithfield: when he was brought to the &s;take, he had it in his power to
&s;ave him&s;elf, by recanting his opinions; but neither hopes nor fears could
prevail upon him to de&s;ert his religion. When the faggots were placed around
him, he &s;eemed no way daunted at the pre|paration, but cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I re&s;ign my life with joy, in te&s;timony of
the doctrine of Je&s;us.</HI></Q> Hooper had his pardon offered him upon the
&s;ame terms, but he refu&s;ed it with equal indignation. This old mar|tyr, who
was executed at Glouce&s;ter, was three quarters of an hour in torment; the
fire, either from malice or neglect, had not been &s;ufficiently kindled, &s;o
that his legs and thighs were fir&s;t burnt, and one of his hands dropped off
before he expired.</P>
<P>Saunders and Taylor, two other clergymen, who&s;e zeal had been
di&s;tingui&s;hed in carrying on <PB N="270" REF="273"> the reformation, were
the next that &s;uffered Taylor was put into a pitch barrel, and before the
fire was kindled, a faggot from an unknown hand was thrown at his head, which
&s;treamed with blood: &s;till, however, he continued undaunted, &s;inging the
xxxi&s;t P&s;alm in Engli&s;h, which one of the &s;pec|tators ob&s;erving, hit
him a blow on the &s;ide of the head, and commanded him to pray in Latin: he
therefore continued a few minutes &s;ilent, only with his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly
fixed upon heaven; when one of the guards, either through impatience or
compa&s;|&s;ion, &s;truck him down with his halbert, and thus delivered him
from a world of pain to a life of im|mortal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The death of the&s;e only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the &s;avage
appetite of the Monks and Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops for fre&s;h &s;laughter. Bonner,
bloated at once with rage and luxury, let loo&s;e his vengeance without
re&s;traint; while the Queen, by letters, exhorted him to pur&s;ue the pious
work without pity or in|terruption: and now Ridley, Bi&s;hop of London, and the
venerable Latimer, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, were to receive the Martyr's crown.
Ridley was one of the able&s;t champions of the reformation; his piety,
learning, and &s;olidity of judgment, were admired by his friends and dreaded
by his enemies. The night before his execution he invited the mayor of Oxford,
and his wife, to &s;ee him die; and, when he &s;aw them melted into tears, he
him|&s;elf appeared quite unmoved, heaven being his &s;e|cret &s;upporter and
comforter in this hour of agony. When he came to the &s;take where he was to be
burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there be|fore him, and began to comfort
him in his &s;uffer|ings, while Latimer was as ready to return the kind office.
A furious bigot a&s;cended to preach to <PB N="271" REF="274"> them, before the
execution of their &s;entence: Ridley gave a &s;erious attention to the
&s;ermon, and offered to an&s;wer it, but this he was not allowed to do. At
length the fire was &s;et to the pile; Latimer was &s;oon out of pain, but
Ridley continued much longer, his legs being con&s;umed before the fire reached
his vitals.</P>
<P>Cranmer, whom you have &s;een already &s;o zea|lous in the
reformation, was the next per&s;onage of note that was burnt: he had this
peculiar ag|gravation of his calamity, that he was prevailed upon to abjure his
principles and &s;ign his recanta|tion, by the hopes of pardon. Being,
notwith|&s;tanding this, brought to the &s;take, his confu&s;ion and &s;hame
were there inexpre&s;&s;ible: there he re|tracted all that their fal&s;e
promi&s;es had made him abjure; and, re&s;olving that the hand which had
&s;igned &s;hould fir&s;t &s;uffer, he held it out, with an intrepid
countenance, in the flames, till it dropped off, frequently crying out, in the
mid&s;t of his ago|ny, <HI>that unworthy hand!</HI></P>
<P>Bonner now &s;eemed not &s;atisfied with &s;ingle deaths, but &s;ent
men in whole companies to the flames; women them&s;elves were not &s;pared: but
the cruelty went yet farther; a woman, condemn|ed for here&s;y, was delivered
of a child in the mid&s;t of the flames; &s;ome of the &s;pectators hu|manely
&s;natched it out; the magi&s;trate, who was a Papi&s;t, ordered it to be flung
in again, and it was then con&s;umed with the mother. The per|petrators of
&s;uch actions were no longer human; they mu&s;t have forfeited all
preten&s;ions to the name, for hell it&s;elf could be guilty of nothing more
atrocious!</P>
<P>But they were not content with puni&s;hing the living alone, their
vengeance extended even to the <PB N="272" REF="275"> dead: Bucer and Fagius,
two German divines, who had been dead &s;ome years before, were cited, very
formally, to appear and give an account of their faith; in default of their
appearance, their bodies were taken from their graves, and being hung upon a
gallows were con&s;umed to a&s;hes. The wife of Peter Martyr, who him&s;elf had
the pru|dence to e&s;cape, was dug up like the former, and buried in a dung
hill. In &s;hort, the per&s;ecutions of the prie&s;ts and friars went &s;uch
lengths, that the very magi&s;trates who had at fir&s;t been in&s;tru|ments of
their cruelty, at la&s;t refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the puni&s;hing heretics
for the future, till a court, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the inqui&s;ition, was
e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, which continued the &s;laughters without remor&s;e. In this
reign five bi&s;hops, twenty-one mini&s;ters, and above eight hundred others,
went to the flames in maintenance of the truth; num|bers died in pri&s;on, and
&s;everal by whips and tor|tures were forced to abjure.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;till in this di&s;mal &s;ituation with re&s;pect to
religion, the temporal concerns of the nation were conducted with very little
better &s;ucce&s;s. Calais, which had long been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
Engli&s;h, and was a curb to the ambition of France, was taken in this reign by
the Duke of Gui&s;e, and all the Engli&s;h drove out of it, as the great Edward
had drove the French out two hundred years before. The Queen was only bent on
ruining Prote&s;tants, and took no care to defend her dominions.</P>
<P>Philip, her hu&s;band, &s;eemed no way plea&s;ed with his alliance:
the Queen, &s;ome time after their mar|riage, was delivered of a fal&s;e
conception. This created di&s;gu&s;t in him: he quitted England, there|fore, to
pur&s;ue his own &s;chemes in Flanders, leav|ing <PB N="273" REF="276"> the
Queen &s;ufficiently mortified at his coldne&s;s for her, of which he gave
repeated proofs.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Calais, and the di&s;appointment with regard to her
pregnancy, &s;oon excited murmurs among the people. The Prote&s;tants now
exerted their influence in expo&s;ing the weakne&s;s of the government and the
cruelty of the council: but no per&s;on had a greater &s;hare of reproach than
the Queen, and none felt it &s;o &s;everely. The hou&s;e of commons, that had
hitherto been all along &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, now al&s;o te&s;tified their
di&s;plea|&s;ure, and refu&s;ed to grant a &s;ub&s;idy, though &s;he
conde&s;cended to lay the bad &s;tate of her affairs be|fore them. During
the&s;e mortifications her health &s;en&s;ibly declined: &s;he was naturally
melancholy and &s;ullen, and her repeated di&s;appointments in|crea&s;ed her
di&s;temper. She had been ill attended during her pretended pregnancy, having
com|mitted her&s;elf to the care of women, and neglect|ed the advice of her
phy&s;icians. After having been for &s;ome time afflicted with the drop&s;y,
this di&s;or|der carried her off in the forty-third year of her age, after a
reign of about five years. Had &s;he been born at any other period, &s;he might
have been a good Prince&s;s, but her zeal for religion was louder than the
calls of humanity. Henry VIII, her father, acted like a tyrant and a
per&s;ecutor from vicious motives, and he knew it: Mary was both a tyrant and a
per&s;ecutor from motives of vir|tue, and &s;he was never undeceived.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>WERE we to adopt the maxim in morals, that evil may be done for the
production of good, one might &s;ay that the per&s;ecutions in Mary's reign
were permitted only to bring the kingdom over to the Prote&s;tant religion.
Nothing could preach &s;o effectually again&s;t the cruelty and the vices of
the Monks, as the actions of the Monks them&s;elves: wherever heretics were to
be burnt, they were always pre&s;ent, rejoicing at the &s;pectacle, in&s;ulting
the fallen, and frequently the fir&s;t to thru&s;t the flaming brand again&s;t
the faces of the condemned. The Engli&s;h were effectually converted by &s;uch
&s;ights as the&s;e; to bring any people over to any opinion, it is only
nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ecute in&s;tead of attempting to convince: the people
had formerly embraced the reformed reli|gion from fear, they were now
internally Prote&s;|tants from inclination.</P>
<P>We have hitherto &s;een England like the element that &s;urrounds
it, ever un&s;ettled and &s;tormy; ever &s;inking under foreign inva&s;ion or
dome&s;tic di&s;putes: it had felt a &s;hort interval of happine&s;s, indeed,
under Henry VII, but his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;oon di&s;turb|ed that felicity,
and laid the country once more in blood. At length the genius of the people
pre|vailed over all oppo&s;ition, and England was now about to make its own
happine&s;s, and to &s;et man|kind an example of indu&s;try, commerce, freedom,
learning, opulence, and power.</P>
<P>To Mary &s;ucceeded her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, who was unanimou&s;ly
declared Queen at the accu&s;tom|ed places, and with the acclamations of the
people. Elizabeth had her education in that be&s;t of &s;chools, 
<PB N="275" REF="278"> the &s;chool of adver&s;ity: as during the life of her
&s;i&s;ter, who had no children, &s;he was next heir to the throne, and at the
&s;ame time was known to be of the Prote&s;tant religion, &s;he was obnoxious
to the reigning tyrant for two rea&s;ons: it was fear|ed &s;he might a&s;pire
to the throne during her &s;i&s;ter's life; but it was &s;till more
rea&s;onably apprehended, that &s;he would, if ever &s;he came to the crown,
make an innovation in that religion which Mary took &s;o much pains to
e&s;tabli&s;h. The Bi&s;hops, who had &s;hed &s;uch a deluge of blood,
fore&s;aw this, and often told Mary, that her de&s;troying meaner heretics was
of no advantage to the &s;tate, unle&s;s &s;he attacked the principal heretic;
that it was to no purpo&s;e to lop off the branches while the body of the tree
was &s;uffered to &s;tand: Mary &s;aw and ac|knowledged the ju&s;tice of their
ob&s;ervations, con|fined her &s;i&s;ter with proper guards, and only waited
for &s;ome new in&s;urrection, or &s;ome favourable pre|text to de&s;troy her:
her own death prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty, and
Elizabeth was taken from a pri&s;on to be fixed upon a throne.</P>
<P>Elizabeth had made the proper u&s;e of her con|finement; being
debarred the enjoyment of plea|&s;ures abroad, &s;he &s;ought for knowledge at
home; &s;he cultivated her under&s;tanding, learned the lan|guages and
&s;ciences; but, of all the arts in which &s;he excelled, her arts of keeping
fair with her &s;i&s;|ter, of not offending the Papi&s;ts, of being in
e&s;|teem with the Prote&s;tants, of di&s;&s;embling and learn|ing to reign,
were the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>This virgin Monarch, who&s;e memory England &s;till reveres with
gratitude and re&s;pect, was &s;carce proclaimed Queen, when Philip of Spain,
who had been married to Mary, but who ever te&s;tified an inclination for
Elizabeth, &s;ought her in mar|riage. <PB N="276" REF="279"> What political
motives Elizabeth might have again&s;t this match, is uncertain; but certain it
is, &s;he neither liked the per&s;on nor the religion of her admirer: &s;he was
willing at once to enjoy the plea&s;ure of independance and the vanity of
nu|merous &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>She had ever re&s;olved upon reforming the church, even in the
re&s;traints of a pri&s;on; and, upon com|ing to the throne, &s;he immediately
&s;et about that great de&s;ign. The people were now almo&s;t whol|ly of the
Prote&s;tant religion; the ill u&s;e the Papi&s;ts had made of their power, in
the la&s;t reign, had to|tally undone their cau&s;e: a religion, marked with
cruelty, tyranny, and per&s;ecution, was not a re|ligion for the people of
England. She began, therefore, in imitation of the decea&s;ed Queen, to forbid
all meddling with controver&s;y in the pulpit, and all innovations of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed rites, except that the &s;ervice &s;hould be performed in the
vulgar tongue, till a parliament &s;hould determine the pro|per modes of
wor&s;hip. The parliament &s;oon met, and the reformation was fini&s;hed, and
religion e&s;tabli&s;hed in the manner we enjoy it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition which was made to the&s;e reli|gious
e&s;tabli&s;hments was but weak; a conference of nine doctors on each &s;ide
was propo&s;ed and agreed to; they were to di&s;pute publicly upon either
&s;ide of the que&s;tion, and it was re&s;olved that the peo|ple &s;hould hold
to that which came off with vic|tory. Di&s;putations of this kind are never
attend|ed with conviction to either party; &s;o much is to be &s;aid on either
&s;ide, and &s;o wide is the field that both &s;ides have to range in, that
each generally lo&s;es his &s;trength in vain preparations, and inef|fectual
prefacing, before he is properly &s;aid to begin the engagement. The
conference, therefore, came <PB N="277" REF="280"> to nothing; the Papi&s;ts
declared, that it was not in their power to di&s;pute a &s;econd time upon
to|pics, in which they had gained a former victory under Queen Mary; and the
Prote&s;tants attributed the caution to their fears. Of nine thou&s;and four
hundred beneficed clergymen, which were in the whole kingdom, only fourteen
Bi&s;hops, twelve Arch-deacons, fifteen heads of colleges, and about eighty of
the parochial clergy, cho&s;e to quit their preferments rather than their
religion. Thus England changed its belief in religion four times &s;ince Henry
VIII. Strange, &s;ays a foreign writer, that a people, who are &s;o re&s;olute,
&s;hould be guil|ty of &s;o much incon&s;tancy! That the &s;ame peo|ple, who
this day publicly burnt heretics, &s;hould the next not only think them
guiltle&s;s, but con|form to their opinions.</P>
<P>Elizabeth was now fixed upon a Prote&s;tant throne, while all the
neighbouring nations were open or &s;ecret enemies: France, Scotland, Spain,
the Pope, were all combined again&s;t her. Her &s;ubjects of Ireland were
concealed enemies, and the Catholic party in England, though not &s;o numerous
as for|merly, yet was not entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: the&s;e were the dangers
&s;he had to fear, nor had &s;he one friend to a&s;&s;i&s;t her upon an
emergency. In this &s;ituation, therefore, &s;he could hope for no other
re&s;ource, but what proceeded from the affection of her own &s;ubjects, and
the wi&s;dom of her admini&s;tration. To make her&s;elf beloved by the people,
and, at the &s;ame time, feared by her courtiers, were the governing maxims of
her conduct. She was frugal of the public trea&s;ury, and &s;till more
&s;paring in her rewards to her favourites: this at once kept the people in
&s;pirits, and kept the great too poor to &s;hake off lawful &s;ubjection. She
di&s;|tributed <PB N="278" REF="281"> both rewards and puni&s;hments with
im|partiality; knew when to flatter and when to up|braid; could di&s;&s;emble
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but pre&s;erve her prerogative: in &s;hort, &s;he &s;eemed to
have &s;tu|died the people &s;he was to govern, and often to have flattered
their follies in order to &s;ecure their hearts.</P>
<P>Her chief mini&s;ter was Robert Dudley, &s;on to the late Duke of
Northumberland, whom the Queen &s;eemed to regard from capricious motives, as
he had neither abilities nor virtue; but, to make amends, the two favourites
next in power were Bacon and Cecil, men of great capacity and infinite
application. They regulated the finances, and directed the political mea&s;ures
that were fol|lowed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mary Stewart, Queen of France and Scotland, gave the fir&s;t alarm
to this &s;tate of tranquility, by taking the title of Queen of England; and
her cau&s;e was &s;upported by the Popi&s;h faction, which &s;till wanted to
make new di&s;turbances. The throne of Elizabeth was not yet perfectly fixed,
and the intrigues of religion could &s;till overturn it: &s;he therefore was
not remi&s;s in &s;ending an army into Scotland, and forcing the French troops
out of that kingdom, by a treaty &s;igned to that effect. Soon after the King
of France died, and Eliza|beth forced her rival to renounce the title of Queen
of England, which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed. She went yet &s;till farther, &s;he
encouraged the parliament of Scotland to introduce the reformation into that
country; her intrigues &s;ucceeded, and &s;he thus gained over a &s;tedfa&s;t
friend in the Scots, from whom the Engli&s;h had, till then, only received
repeated acts of enmity and ill-will.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282"> This tempe&s;t was &s;carce allayed, when
Philip of Spain gave new alarms. As long as he had fears from the power of the
Queen of Scots, by her union with France, he was &s;till attached to Elizabeth;
but, when, by the death of the King of France her hu&s;band, &s;he was again
reduced to her primitive weakne&s;s, his jealou&s;y then began to fall upon
Elizabeth. With this view he en|couraged the in&s;urrections and di&s;contents
in Ire|land, and Elizabeth with equal care &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them. He
&s;upported, in France, a league made to exclude the royal family from the
throne; Eli|zabeth protected the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. He oppre&s;&s;ed the people
of Holland with cruelty and inju&s;tice; Elizabeth &s;upported them from
&s;inking under his power. Thus, on every &s;ide, &s;he guarded off the dangers
that threatened her, and &s;oon after, in her turn, prepared to act
offen&s;ively again&s;t her ene|mies.</P>
<P>But the cares of war did not repre&s;s her a&s;&s;iduity in the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice at home: &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;hew the Roman
Catholic party an ex|ample of moderation, which they might admire but could not
imitate. The Monks, who were di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of their mona&s;teries,
had been a&s;&s;igned pen|&s;ions, which were to be paid by the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the forfeited lands. The&s;e payments were entire|ly
neglected, and the&s;e unhappy men, who had been educated in &s;olitude and
ignorance, were now &s;tarving in old-age, too much di&s;regarded by the
Prote&s;tants, and too numerous to find relief from tho&s;e of their own
per&s;ua&s;ion. Elizabeth ordered that their pen&s;ions &s;hould be paid with
punctuality and ju&s;tice, and &s;atisfaction made for all arrears unju&s;tly
detained.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="283"> In order the more to ingratiate her&s;elf
with the people, &s;he vi&s;ited Cambridge and Oxford, and made each a Latin
&s;peech, and &s;hewed, by her di&s;|cour&s;e and conduct, a regard for tho&s;e
&s;eminaries of learning, which had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her fa|ther.</P>
<P>She not only affected this obliging carriage to her inferiors, but
al&s;o behaved in &s;omething of a romantic &s;train to the courtiers next her
per&s;on. The gallantries of the court were conducted ac|cording to the rules
of chivalry: every dam&s;el had her knight; Dudley, who was now become Earl of
Leice&s;ter, was generally the Queen's: but all writers agree, that her
pa&s;&s;ion for him never pro|ceeded beyond the bounds of Platonic affection.
When her commons, in a dutiful manner, repre|&s;ented to her how much the
&s;afety of the kingdom depended upon her marrying, &s;he thanked them in an
obliging manner, and a&s;&s;ured them &s;he was now become the wife of her
people, and would be plea&s;ed at having it in&s;cribed on her tomb, that
having reigned with equity, &s;he lived and died a virgin.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient ferocity of the Engli&s;h was not yet quite reclaimed:
the barbarous method of fixing the Monarch upon the throne, by exe|cutions
performed upon the &s;caffold, was not quite done away: the only difference
&s;eemed to be, that formerly tho&s;e who were obnoxious to the crown, fell
without any legal trial; but now they fell with all the forms, yet all the
&s;everity of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="284"> While Elizabeth was thus attempting to
&s;ettle religion, to e&s;tabli&s;h the power, and humble the enemies of her
country, &s;he at the &s;ame time was guilty of &s;ome in&s;tances of cruelty,
which, tho' coloured with the pretext of law, could only be the effect of the
yet uncivilized di&s;po&s;ition of the times. The Catholics held meetings to
re&s;tore their religion by open force: the Counte&s;s of Le|nox, Arthur Poole,
and others, began to form fac|tions in the kingdom: their plottings, however,
were di&s;covered, and, upon their own confe&s;&s;ion, they were condemned; but
the Queen, in con&s;i|deration of their illu&s;trious de&s;cent, forgave their
offence. A &s;i&s;ter of the late Jane Grey, however, though le&s;s guilty, met
with le&s;s clemency: &s;he had married the Earl of Pembroke, without leave
from the court; this was con&s;idered as an high offence, and the Earl and
&s;he were committed to the Tower. After a long impri&s;onment he was obliged
to for&s;ake her; and &s;he, loaded with the misfortune, died in
confinement.</P>
<P>But this only prepared the way for a cruelty of a more heinous
nature, which gave the world a di&s;agreeable remembrance of the tran&s;actions
com|mitted in the reign of her father. Mary, Queen of Scots, had long renounced
her title to the crown of England, but not her claim of &s;ucceeding to the
throne: this renunciation, however, being extort|ed from her by Elizabeth, Mary
took every method of di&s;turbing her in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
crown, and yet gave every mark of reconciliation and &s;in|cere amity. There
were, in fact, many circum&s;tances to contribute to their mutual di&s;like:
the jealou&s;y of neighbouring crowns, the oppo&s;ition of religion, of wit,
and of beauty; Mary, le&s;s powerful, le&s;s ab&s;olute, le&s;s politic, was,
however, Elizabeth's <PB N="282" REF="285"> &s;uperior in per&s;onal charms,
and this only &s;erved to inflame their animo&s;ity. The Queen of Scot|land
encouraged the Catholic faction in England, while Elizabeth, with &s;till more
&s;ucce&s;s, fomented the Prote&s;tant party among the Scots. Mary had now, for
&s;ome time, thoughts of marrying a &s;e|cond hu&s;band, after the death of the
French King; Elizabeth, on the other hand, who had no thoughts of marriage
her&s;elf, &s;trove, by every art, to pre|vent this marriage, as &s;he
con&s;idered that it would be &s;trengthening the power of her rival. With this
view &s;he wrote Mary a letter, in which, after many in&s;incere
prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, &s;he begged that Mary would not offer to
marry till her con&s;ent &s;hould fir&s;t be obtained. This unrea&s;onable
reque&s;t not a little di&s;turbed the Queen of Scot|land, but, fearing to
offend her potent rival, &s;he pretended to comply; in &s;ecret, however, &s;he
was re&s;olved to marry the Earl of Darnly, her rela|tion, who had the merit of
being a Catholic, like her&s;elf; but, perhaps, who&s;e greate&s;t
recommen|dations were his &s;ize and his per&s;on, which were large and comely.
The party gained by Eliza|beth, in Scotland, tried every mea&s;ure to prevent
her de&s;ign. It was agitated, whether the Queen could marry without the
con&s;ent of the &s;tates; &s;everal of the nobility ro&s;e in arms to prevent
it, the amba&s;&s;adors of England made daily remon|&s;trances upon its
impropriety, but all in vain: Mary, to cut &s;hort their proceedings, had the
marriage &s;olemnized in her own chapel, and ba|ni&s;hed the oppo&s;ers by a
&s;olemn act of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>All hitherto appeared fortunate for Mary; her enemies bani&s;hed,
her rival defeated, and her&s;elf married to the man &s;he loved: yet this was
but a flattering calm, for &s;oon, whether from the capri|ciou&s;ne&s;s 
<PB N="283" REF="286"> of her temper, or from what other cau&s;e I will not
pretend to determine, Lord Darnly, notwith&s;tanding the elegance of his
per&s;on, be|came entirely di&s;agreeable to her. She had con|ceived &s;uch an
aver&s;ion to him, that it was &s;oon obvious, even to the people; and &s;he
took every method to mortify him in the eyes of the public. Her vices were the
cau&s;e of all her misfortunes: there was, at that time in her court, one David
Rizzio, the &s;on of a mu&s;ician at Turin, who had followed the amba&s;&s;ador
from that court into Scot|land. As he under&s;tood mu&s;ic to perfection, and
&s;ung a good ba&s;s, he was introduced into the Queen's concert, who was &s;o
taken with him, that &s;he de&s;ired the amba&s;&s;ador, upon his depar|ture,
to leave Rizzio behind. The excellence of his voice &s;oon procured him greater
familiarities; the Queen loved him, confided in him, and ever kept him next her
per&s;on. The new King, who now only had the name, could not, without
jea|lou&s;y, &s;ee this in&s;inuating foreigner receive all the Queen's
favours, while he was treated only with contempt. Stung at once with envy,
rage, and re&s;entment, he at length re&s;olved to murder the man he could not
equal, and con&s;ulted with &s;ome Lords about the method of accompli&s;hing
his cruel de&s;ign. Men in power ever find accomplices in their guilt; two
other Lords and he &s;ettled it, that the murder &s;hould be committed before
the face of the Queen, as a puni&s;hment of her &s;candalous conduct: thus
prepared, they were informed that Rizzio was, at that very in&s;tant, in the
Queen's chamber; Lord Darnly led the way, conducting the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins up
by a private &s;tair-ca&s;e, and entering the Queen's chamber, who was at table
with her favourite Rizzio; Darnly &s;tood for &s;ome time lean|ing 
<PB N="284" REF="287"> upon the back of her chair. His fierce looks, and
unexpected intru&s;ion, in &s;ome mea&s;ure alarm|ed the Queen, who, however,
kept &s;ilence, not daring to call out: a little after Lord Ruthven, one of the
murderers, and George Douglas, en|tered abruptly, all in arms, and attended
with more of their accomplices. The Queen could no longer refrain, but a&s;ked
the rea&s;on of this bold intru&s;ion; Ruthven made her no an&s;wer, but
ordered Rizzio to quit a place of which he was unworthy. Rizzio now &s;aw that
he was the ob|ject of their vengeance, and, trembling with fear, took hold of
the Queen's robe, to put him&s;elf un|der her protection, who, on her part,
&s;trove to in|terpo&s;e between the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and him: Douglas, in the
mean time, had reached the unfortunate Rizzio, and, taking a dagger from the
King's &s;ide, drew it, and, while the Queen filled the room with her cries, he
plunged it, in her pre&s;ence, into Rizzio's bo&s;om. She was five months gone
with child, and this horrid &s;cene had &s;uch an effect up|on the fruit of her
womb, that it is &s;aid that her child, who was afterwards King James I, could
never venture to look upon a drawn &s;word without &s;huddering. Thus ended
Rizzio, a man who has been more &s;poken of, than perhaps any other who ro&s;e
from &s;o mean a &s;tation. What his other ta|lents to plea&s;e might have
been, is unknown; but certain it is, that &s;everal indications of his &s;kill
in mu&s;ic remain even to the pre&s;ent time: all tho&s;e plea&s;ing Scotch
airs, which are &s;et in &s;uch a peculiar ta&s;te, being univer&s;ally allowed
to be of his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This was but a temporary check upon Mary's power; &s;he re&s;umed
her authority, by the influence of her charms upon the Earl her hu&s;band, who 
<PB N="285" REF="288"> gave up the murderers of Rizzio to her re&s;entment, but
they had previou&s;ly e&s;caped into England. One criminal engagement, however,
was &s;carcely got over, when Mary fell into a &s;econd: the Earl of Bothwell
now began to hold the &s;ame place in her affections that Rizzio had formerly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. This new amour was attended with &s;till more ter|rible
con&s;equences than the former; her hu&s;band fell a victim to it. His life was
fir&s;t attempted by poi&s;on, but the &s;trength of his con&s;titution &s;aved
him for a &s;hort time, only to fall by a more vio|lent death: he was
&s;trangled by night, the hou&s;e in which the fact was committed being blown
up with gun-powder, in order to per&s;uade the people that his death was
accidental; but his &s;hirt not being &s;inged, and his &s;lippers found near
him, to|gether with blue marks round his neck, &s;oon con|firmed the
&s;u&s;picion of his real murder. His body was buried near that of Rizzio,
among the Scotti&s;h Kings.</P>
<P>All orders of the &s;tate, the whole body of people, accu&s;ed
Bothwell of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and at la&s;t demanded ju&s;tice upon
him from the Queen, for the late murder, openly arraigning him of the guilt. In
this univer&s;al demand for ju&s;tice, the Queen, deaf to the murmurs of her
people, deaf to the voice of decency, married the murderer of her hu&s;band,
and prevailed upon him to divorce his former wife to make way for this fatal
alliance.</P>
<P>Bothwell was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the in&s;olence which attends
great crimes: he a&s;&s;embled the principal Lords of the &s;tate, and
compelled them to &s;ign an in&s;trument, purporting, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that they judged it the Queen's intere&s;t to
marry Bothwell, as he had lain with her again&s;t her will.</HI></Q> The&s;e
tran&s;actions excited the whole kingdom of Scotland to re&s;i&s;tance, and 
<PB N="286" REF="289"> Mary, abandoned by her followers, was obliged to give
her&s;elf up as a pri&s;oner to the confederacy. Bothwell fled to the Orkney
i&s;lands. The Queen, being confined in Lochlevin ca&s;tle, was compelled to
re&s;ign the crown to her &s;on, as yet a child; but &s;he was permitted to
nominate a regent. She turned her eyes upon the Earl of Murray, who was then in
France, and appointed him, expecting that he would defend her cau&s;e, and
re&s;tore her. In this, however, &s;he was entirely deceived; Mur|ray, upon his
arrival, in&s;tead of comforting her as he formerly u&s;ed, loaded her with
reproaches, which reduced her almo&s;t to de&s;pair. The cala|mities of the
great, however ju&s;tly de&s;erved, excite pity and create friends; an army of
forty thou&s;and men declared in her favour, and &s;he e&s;caped from pri&s;on
to put her&s;elf at their head. But this was only to encounter new misfortunes;
&s;he was met by a body of but four thou&s;and, commanded by the new regent,
and was totally defeated. For fear of falling into the hands of her enemies,
&s;he fled towards the borders of England; Elizabeth, being informed of her
misfortunes and her retreat, at fir&s;t granted her an honourable reception,
and ordered her to be lodged at a gentleman's hou&s;e, where &s;he was treated
with fitting dignity. Not|with&s;tanding this kindne&s;s, &s;he refu&s;ed to
&s;ee her until &s;he had ju&s;tified her&s;elf from the reproaches with which
&s;he was branded. By this means Eli|zabeth in a manner declared her&s;elf
umpire of the differences between the two parties, and each ac|cordingly
pleaded their cau&s;e before her; Mary by her emi&s;&s;aries, and Murray, the
regent, in per|&s;on. It was the Queen of England's duty to pro|tect, and not
to examine, her royal fugitive: however, &s;he lengthened out the pleadings on
both <PB N="287" REF="290"> &s;ides, and enjoyed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her
rival humbled, without pa&s;&s;ing any definitive &s;entence. Mary privately
complained of her unworthy treat|ment and long delay; the&s;e complaints were
car|ried to Elizabeth, which ended in the Queen of Scots being &s;ent a
pri&s;oner to Tutbury ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The di&s;a&s;ters of the crown of Scotland fell up|on the people,
divided as they were into factions, and animated with mutual animo&s;ity. The
regent, attempting to quell them, was him&s;elf &s;lain, and the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, pretending to act in the name of their impri&s;oned Queen,
made an incur&s;ion into Eng|land, and committed &s;ome ravages on the frontier
counties. Elizabeth, with an army, quickly re|pre&s;&s;ed the&s;e invaders, and
procured the Earl of Lenox, brother to the late regent, to be elected in his
room. In the mean time, while &s;he was employed in bringing Scotland to
mea&s;ures, &s;he found her&s;elf attacked, in her own dominions, by a
con&s;piracy: the Pope, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the re|bels, procured a bull
to be fixed up in &s;everal places in London, whereby he excommunicated
Elizabeth, and ab&s;olved her &s;ubjects from their oath of allegiance. This
bull was fixed up by John Felton, grand uncle to him whom we are &s;hortly to
&s;ee act another de&s;perate part: John Felton, when he was told that the
government was in pur&s;uit of him, di&s;dained to fly; he waited with
intrepidity till he was taken, and then boldly confe&s;&s;ed the fact of which
he was charged, and gloried in the commi&s;&s;ion: he might have received
pardon upon acknowledging his crime, but he re|fu&s;ed it, and was hanged near
the place, meeting death with a re&s;olution that a&s;toni&s;hed even the
brave. What noble actions might not &s;uch a mind <PB N="288" REF="291"> have
been capable of, had it at fir&s;t received a right direction.</P>
<P>The&s;e efforts, in favour of the Queen of Scots, only &s;erved to
ha&s;ten her ruin. The two Queens entered into various negotiations and
frivolous treaties; the one attempting to humble her pri|&s;oner, the other,
with fruitle&s;s pride, attempting to pre&s;erve the lu&s;tre of fallen
Maje&s;ty. Scotland, in the mean time, &s;treamed with blood: the Pa|pi&s;ts
and the Prote&s;tants carried on a civil war. The Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's,
one of the warme&s;t partizans of Mary, was taken in arms, and executed upon
the depo&s;ition of his confe&s;&s;or, who &s;wore that this prelate had
privately confe&s;&s;ed that he was an accomplice in the murder of Darn|ly.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t misfortunes of Mary rather pro|ceeded from her
friends than enemies. The Duke of Norfolk, who profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for
her, expected, by her means, to ri&s;e to the Briti&s;h throne: he, therefore,
privately negotiated a mar|riage with her, and &s;he, on the other hand,
at|tempted to break off that which &s;he had already contracted with Bothwell.
He formed a party in London, feeble indeed; but he expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from the intrigues of the Pope, and the arms of Spain: he was him&s;elf a weak
man, and his plots were but &s;hallow; the &s;pies of Elizabeth di&s;cover|ed
them all: he was arre&s;ted, accu&s;ed, condemn|ed, and executed. This
nobleman's blood only contributed to fa&s;ten the chains of the unfortu|nate
Mary; yet, &s;till, &s;he conceived hopes from foreign a&s;&s;iances, which
&s;eldom are of any weight in dome&s;tic di&s;putes. She had the League in
France in her favour, the Pope, the Spaniards, and the Je&s;uits; &s;he not
only hoped to be rein&s;tated in her <PB N="289" REF="292"> former power, but
to have the crown of England, to which &s;he laid claim as her birth-right,
added to her own. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e de&s;igns, a new con&s;piracy was
formed, fourteen of the con&s;pira|tors executed, and, la&s;t of all, Mary was
brought to a trial, before a Queen who had no other right to be her judge, but
that of power. Forty-two members of parliament, and five judges, were &s;ent to
examine her in pri&s;on; &s;he prote&s;ted again&s;t their right, yet made a
defence: they had origi|nally no foundation in ju&s;tice to try her, and they
carried on her accu&s;ation with only a &s;hew of equi|ty. In &s;hort, after an
impri&s;onment of eighteen years, this unhappy Prince&s;s was brought to the
block, and beheaded in one of the rooms of her pri&s;on, which had been hung in
black for the oc|ca&s;ion. This action &s;tained the reign of Elizabeth with
&s;uch colours, as neither her di&s;&s;imulation, nor the pro&s;perity of her
reign, could ever wa&s;h away: her &s;ubjects, while they found them&s;elves
happy, attempted to excu&s;e her conduct, but con|&s;cience internally
condemned her cruelty, and time, that &s;peaks plain, at la&s;t declares her
guilt. In treating the actions of mankind, we almo&s;t ever find both &s;ides
culpable, and &s;o it was here, Mary, who was a murderer and adultere&s;s, died
by the orders of Elizabeth, who was at once cruel and unju&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;titution of England took a long &s;eries of years to
&s;ettle into form, nor even yet was its &s;tructure entirely completed: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;till pre&s;erved a degree of
ancient pride, <PB N="290" REF="293"> and often were guilty of inju&s;tice and
tyranny, without puni&s;hment. Had the actions of Eliza|beth, which are now the
&s;ubject of our prai&s;e, only been performed by one of our pre&s;ent
Mo|narchs, they would be &s;ufficient to cau&s;e his ex|pul&s;ion: there is
&s;omething lucky in every great reign, like this in view; its lu&s;tre is
rather owing to the indifferent periods that preceded it, than to its own
intrin&s;ic value. Elizabeth left her king|dom, it mu&s;t be owned, in a better
&s;tate than &s;he found it; but her actions &s;hould be neither the &s;ubject
of our prai&s;e, nor the object of our imi|tation.</P>
<P>We &s;ee a mixture of cruelty and gallantry in all the
tran&s;actions of the&s;e times: while Elizabeth was thus plotting the death of
Mary, &s;he was, at the &s;ame time, employed in a treaty of marriage with the
young Duke of Anjou. This, however, came to nothing, the Queen re&s;olving to
enjoy that power uncontrouled, which her &s;ubjects had not yet learned to
abridge.</P>
<P>But, though &s;he di&s;liked an hu&s;band, yet none more
pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to have a lover: it is thought, indeed, her
affections were confined to Platonic wi&s;hes only, and her age, for &s;he now
began to decline, &s;eemed to favour the &s;uppo&s;ition; but the choice of her
favourites countenanced the contrary report, and her &s;orrow for the Earl of
Lei|ce&s;ter, who died about this time, confirmed it. But one favourite always
made room for another, and Devereux, Earl of E&s;&s;ex, &s;ucceeded Dudley,
Earl of Leice&s;ter. This nobleman was young, active, ambitious, witty, and
hand&s;ome; in the field and at court he ever appeared with &s;uperior
lu&s;tre. In all the ma&s;ques which were then performed, the Earl and
Elizabeth were generally coupled as part|ners; <PB N="291" REF="294"> and,
though &s;he was almo&s;t &s;ixty, and he not half that number of years, yet
flattery had taught her to forget the di&s;parity of age; the world told her
&s;he was &s;till beautiful and young, and &s;he was inclined to think &s;o.
This young Earl's intere&s;t in the Queen's heart, as may natu|rally be
expected, promoted his intere&s;ts in the &s;tate: he conducted all things
without a rival, and, wherever he went, he acquired a degree of unbounded
popularity. Young and unexperienced as he was, he at length began to fancy the
ap|plau&s;e of the people given to his merits, and not to his favour: thus
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fal&s;e opinion of his own &s;ecurity, to u&s;e the
words of the poet, he kicked down the ladder by which he ro&s;e; he be|gan to
de&s;pi&s;e the Queen, and was heard to drop &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, that he
thought her, in &s;pite of flattery, both old and ugly. Her remon&s;trances, on
this occa&s;ion, were &s;uch as might have been expected from a di&s;appointed
girl, very angry, yet wi&s;hing for a vindication. She gave him, in a
pa&s;&s;ion, a box on the ear, pardoned him, employ|ed him; he again
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he again par|doned the offence. Secure in her
affections, he at length proceeded to actual di&s;obedience; his former favour
had gained him enemies, his pre&s;ent in&s;olence lo&s;t him the friend&s;hip
of the Queen; he was condemned to retirement, when he might have been capitally
convicted. He now came to a &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;conduct, and was re&s;olved
to try the long unpracti&s;ed arts that had at fir&s;t brought him into favour.
Immediately after &s;entence, when he was preparing for retirement into the
country, he fir&s;t a&s;&s;ured the Queen, that he could never be happy till he
again &s;aw tho&s;e eyes which were u&s;ed to &s;hine upon him with &s;uch
lu&s;tre; <PB N="292" REF="295"> that, in expectance of that happy moment, like
another Nebuchadnezzar, he would dwell with the bea&s;ts of the field, and be
wet with the dew of heaven, till &s;he again propitiou&s;ly took pity on his
&s;ufferings. This romantic me&s;&s;age &s;eemed pecu|liarly plea&s;ing to the
Queen; &s;he thought him &s;in|cere from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own
&s;incerity: &s;he replied, that, after &s;ome time, when convinced of his
humility, &s;omething perhaps might be ex|pected from her lenity. This hope of
pardon made him think &s;lightly of his guilt: his pride once more increa&s;ing
with his &s;ucce&s;s, he laid de|&s;igns of de&s;troying his rivals in power,
and &s;e|curing the per&s;on of the Queen. With this re|&s;olution, he
impri&s;oned the Queen's me&s;&s;engers, headed a few malecontents, and marched
through the city, exhorting the citizens to arms, and cry|ing out for the
Queen, for the Queen. During a long march, not one citizen thought proper to
join him, though numbers, led by curio&s;ity, ran to &s;ee him pa&s;s by. In
this di&s;appointment, word was brought that he was proclaimed a traitor; upon
which he made one effort more to excite an in&s;ur|rection, but without
&s;ucce&s;s: he therefore now re|&s;olved to return to his own hou&s;e, but
found the &s;treet &s;ecured by a great chain, and a guard of &s;ol|diers. As
he &s;aw no other way to force his pa&s;|&s;age, but by an attack upon the
guards, attended by his followers, he immediately fell on, but was beat back
and wounded in the thigh. He then went down to the water-&s;ide, and, putting
him&s;elf and his retinue on board &s;mall boats, he e&s;caped to his hou&s;e,
which he fortified in the be&s;t manner he could. The hou&s;e was &s;oon
inve&s;ted by the Lord Admiral, and the Earl and his followers were obliged to
deliver them&s;elves up: the Earl of <PB N="293" REF="296"> Southampton was a
companion in his guilt and his misfortunes; they were &s;oon after brought to
their trials, and condemned to die: when the day of his death came, the Queen
appeared irre&s;olute; &s;he &s;ent an order to &s;top the execution, and
&s;oon after ordered it to proceed. However romantic it may &s;eem, &s;he felt
in her bo&s;om all the fluctuations of love and re&s;entment, and was
irre&s;olute which pa&s;&s;ion to obey: her re&s;entment, at la&s;t, prevailed;
he was executed &s;ix days after his &s;entence, and died with penitence and
re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Thus ended a favourite who had merits, but did not owe his ri&s;e to
them; he was gallant, ro|mantic, and o&s;tentatious: his genius for &s;hews,
and tho&s;e plea&s;ures that carry an image of war, was as remarkable as his
&s;pirit in the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf; and, had he been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
humility equal to his abilities, he at la&s;t might have mounted a throne
in&s;tead of a &s;caffold. The Queen, at fir&s;t, carried her re&s;entment &s;o
far as to have a &s;ermon preached at St. Paul's cro&s;s to blacken his
memo|ry: his haughty behaviour, and unguarded ex|pre&s;&s;ions, had entirely
alienated her affections, and imprinted an a&s;perity, which, it &s;eems, even
his death could not &s;often.</P>
<P>With the death of this favourite, Elizabeth's plea&s;ures &s;eemed
to expire; &s;he went through the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate merely from
habit, but her happine&s;s was no more. Hi&s;torians are fond of repre&s;enting
all their characters without pa&s;&s;ion, and give to every action of the great
either politi|cal or rational motives; they therefore treat this Queen's
affection as a fable, but many of the actions of her life appear dictated by
re&s;entment or regard, nor ever had woman a greater variety of caprice; the
great feel as the re&s;t of mankind, <PB N="294" REF="297"> and her
pa&s;&s;ions were particularly violent and la&s;t|ing. She lived but a &s;hort
time after the death of E&s;&s;ex, and had the mortification of being
for&s;aken by mo&s;t of her courtiers before &s;he died, who now &s;trove to
court the favour of King James, whom &s;he had appointed her &s;ucce&s;&s;or.
She died in the &s;eventieth year of her age, and the forty-fourth of her
reign. Her character differed with her cir|cum&s;tances; in the beginning of
her reign &s;he was moderate and humble, towards the end haughty and &s;evere:
&s;he was indebted to her good fortune that her mini&s;ters were excellent, but
it was owing to her want of wi&s;dom that her favourites, who were cho&s;en
more immediately by her&s;elf, were unworthy. Tho' &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of excellent &s;en&s;e, yet &s;he never had the di&s;cernment to di&s;cover
that &s;he wanted beauty: to flatter her charms, even at the age of
&s;ixty-five, was the &s;ure&s;t way of gaining her intere&s;t and e&s;teem.
She was greater in her public than her private character, and they mo&s;t
di&s;liked and feared her who were placed next her per&s;on. But, whatever
might have been the Queen's character, the character of her people, at that
period, demands our prai&s;e and imitation. Permit me to re&s;erve that
glorious picture of ge|nius, &s;truggling to get free from barbarity, to the
&s;ucceeding letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER puni&s;hments or cruelties were exerted in this reign, they
mo&s;tly fell upon the Great; but never was the people of England more happy
internally, or more formidable abroad, than during this period: the vices and
virtues of a nation are often wholly a&s;cribed to the Monarch who rules them,
but &s;uch influence extends only through a narrow &s;phere; no &s;ingle reign,
how|ever good, nor indeed any &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of virtuous reigns, can give
happine&s;s, morals, and arts, a general &s;pread, unle&s;s the people be
pre-di&s;po&s;ed for the reception. From Nerva to Antoninus, what a noble
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Roman Emperors! and yet, even under them, Rome was
declining fa&s;t into barbarity: it was not owing to Elizabeth a|lone, that
England enjoyed all its pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s; the people, as if
&s;pontaneou&s;ly, began to exert their native vigour, and every art and every
genius put forth all their powers.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of neither new nor
&s;plendid acqui&s;itions, nor had they &s;uch great influence in foreign
courts: but commerce grew up among them, and, almo&s;t without a pro|tector,
flouri&s;hed with vigour. The people now began to know their real element, and
this ren|dered them more happy than the foreign conque&s;ts or the former
victories of their celebrated kings: a nation, which was once &s;ubject to
every inva|&s;ion, and the prey of every plunderer, now be|came powerful,
polite, laborious, and enterprizing. The newly &s;ucce&s;sful voyages of the
Spaniards and Portugue&s;e excited their emulation: they fitted out &s;everal
expeditions for di&s;covering a nor|thern <PB N="296" REF="299"> pa&s;&s;age to
China, and, though di&s;appointed in their aim, their voyages were not wholly
fruit|le&s;s; Drake and Cavendi&s;h &s;urrounded the globe, and di&s;covered
&s;kill and courage &s;uperior to tho&s;e very nations which had fir&s;t
&s;hewn them the way. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any
a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the government, colonized New England: the&s;e
expeditions at length formed one of the mo&s;t powerful marines of Europe, and
they were able to oppo&s;e the fleet of Spain, called by the boa&s;ting title
of the Invincible Armada, with an hundred &s;hips: when this fleet of Spain had
been de&s;troyed, partly by tempe&s;ts and partly by conduct, the Engli&s;h
remained ma&s;ters at &s;ea. This &s;uperiority was con&s;tantly increa&s;ing,
till another victory, gained over the fleet of Phi|lip III, gained them a naval
&s;overeignty, which they have ever &s;ince inviolably pre&s;erved, and which
has been &s;carce ever mole&s;ted by a competitor.</P>
<P>But external commerce was not more cultivated than internal
manufactures: &s;everal of the Flem|mings, who were per&s;ecuted from their own
coun|try, by the bad conduct of Spain, found an a&s;y|lum in England: the&s;e
more than repaid the pro|tection they found, by the arts which they
intro|duced, and the indu&s;try which was thus propagated by their example.</P>
<P>Thus far in the u&s;eful arts: but, in the polite arts, England
excelled all the world, &s;o that ma|ny writers fix the Augu&s;tan age of
literature to that period. The di&s;putes, cau&s;ed by the reforma|tion of
religion, had retarded the progre&s;s of our language among the powerful, yet
&s;pread a love of literature among the lower orders of the &s;tate. The people
now began to learn to read, and the Bible, tran&s;lated into the vulgar tongue,
was not <PB N="297" REF="300"> only &s;erviceable in improving their morals,
but their ta&s;te. The per&s;ecution of Mary was, how|ever, of great detriment
to the language; the re|formers, being driven into foreign countries, on their
return, introduced, into their &s;ermons, a language compounded of tho&s;e
dialects which they had acquired abroad, and the language of England was
actually in a &s;tate of barbarity, when Eliza|beth came to the throne. Latin
&s;ermons were in fa&s;hion, and few of the nobility had either the courage, or
the ta&s;te, to declare them&s;elves the patrons of learning.</P>
<P>Either the fortune, or the di&s;cernment of Eli|zabeth, made Parker
Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; and he &s;et him&s;elf affiduou&s;ly to reform the
cor|ruptions of &s;tyle, both by precept and example: for this purpo&s;e he
reviewed and corrected the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the Bible, and printed it
with royal magnificence. His own &s;tyle had all the eloquence of the times; it
was manly and con|ci&s;e, but wanted &s;moothne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Earl of E&s;&s;ex, a &s;ketch of who&s;e hi&s;tory you have
&s;een, was him&s;elf one of the greate&s;t im|provers of our language: his
education had freed him from the technical barbarities of the &s;chools, and
his &s;tyle ran on unembarra&s;&s;ed by the &s;tiff|ne&s;s of pedantry. His
letters (particularly that which he wrote from Ireland to the Queen) are
regarded as models of fine writing to this day. Sir Walter Raleigh has the
reputation of being one of the improvers of our language, and none can
conte&s;t with him the honour of being foremo&s;t in the improvement of our
hi&s;tory. Hooker, the author of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, was the fir&s;t
Engli&s;hman who&s;e &s;tyle, upon theological &s;ubjects, does honour to his
memory, as a &s;cholar and a <PB N="298" REF="301"> gentleman. But what
particularly de&s;erves no|tice, is, that a man, like him, bred up in pover|ty,
and &s;eclu&s;ion from the polite, &s;hould expre&s;s him&s;elf in a more
modern and elegant manner than his contemporary authors, Sidney or Raleigh, who
were bred at court.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention only one pro&s;e writer more, the greate&s;t and
wi&s;e&s;t of all our Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers, and perhaps the greate&s;t
philo&s;opher among men; I need hardly mention the name of Francis Bacon, Lord
Verulam; his &s;tyle is copious and correct, and his learning only
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his genius.</P>
<P>Among the poets, two of particular note attract our attention,
Spen&s;er and Shake&s;pear; to attempt an encomium of either is needle&s;s; all
prai&s;e mu&s;t be too low for their merits, or unnece&s;&s;ary to make them
more known.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Engli&s;h now began to rival the Spaniards, who, at
that time, aimed at univer&s;al monarchy, both in arts and arms: the city of
London became more large and more beautiful; the people of the country began to
con&s;ider agri|culture as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and honourable
employments; the Engli&s;h were, in power, the &s;econd nation in Europe, and
they were, &s;hortly, to become the greate&s;t, by becoming the mo&s;t
free.</P>
<P>During this reign, a few &s;uffered death for their religious
opinions; but we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that they rai&s;ed the
di&s;turbances by which they &s;uf|fered, for tho&s;e who lived in quiet were
permitted to enjoy their opinions under the nece&s;&s;ary re|&s;traints.</P>
<P>If we look through hi&s;tory, and con&s;ider the ri&s;e of kingdoms,
we &s;hall not find, in all its vo|lumes, &s;uch an in&s;tance of a nation
becoming wi&s;e, powerful, and happy, in &s;o &s;hort a time. 
<PB N="299" REF="302"> The &s;ource of our felicity began in Henry VII, and,
tho' repre&s;&s;ed by the intervening tyrannies, yet, before the end of
Elizabeth's reign, who was only his grand-daughter, the people became the
mo&s;t poli&s;hed and the mo&s;t happy people upon earth. Liberty, it is true,
as yet continued to fluctuate: Elizabeth knew her own power, and often
&s;tretched it to the very limits of de&s;poti&s;m; but, when commerce was
introduced, liberty ne|ce&s;&s;arily entered in its train; for there never was
a nation perfectly commercial and perfectly de|&s;potic.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are now to turn to a reign, which, tho' not &s;plendid, was
u&s;eful: the Engli&s;h only wanted a &s;ea&s;on of peace, to bring tho&s;e
arts to perfection which were planted in the preceding reign. No Monarch was
fonder of peace than James I, who &s;ucceeded Elizabeth; and none ever enjoyed
a reign of more la&s;ting tranquility. Hi&s;torians, for what rea&s;on I know
not, are fond of de&s;cribing this Monarch's tran&s;actions with ri|dicule;
but, for my own part, I cannot avoid giving ju&s;t applau&s;e, both to his
wi&s;dom and feli|city.</P>
<P>King James came to the throne with the uni|ver&s;al approbation of
all orders of the &s;tate; for, in his per&s;on was united every claim to the
crown, that either de&s;cent, beque&s;t, or parliamentary &s;anc|tion could
confer. But, on his fir&s;t arrival, it was readily &s;een that he by no means
approved of the treatment of his mother, Mary Queen of Scots; 
<PB N="300" REF="303"> and not only refu&s;ed to wear mourning him&s;elf for
the late Queen, by whom &s;he had been beheaded; but al&s;o denied
admi&s;&s;ion to any who appeared in mourning upon her account.</P>
<P>Upon a review of his conduct, there are few of this Monarch's
actions that do not &s;eem to &s;pring from motives of ju&s;tice and virtue;
his only error &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in applying the de&s;potic laws and
maxims of the Scotti&s;h government to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, which was
not &s;u&s;ceptible of them. He began his reign by a laudable attempt to unite
both the kingdoms into one, but this the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h prevented:
they were apprehen&s;ive, that the po&s;ts and employments, which were in the
gift of the court, might be conferred on the Scotch, whom they were, as yet,
taught to re|gard as foreigners. By his repul&s;e in this in&s;tance, he found
the people he came to govern very diffe|rent from tho&s;e he had left, and
perceived that the liberty and the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h could not be
re&s;trained by the &s;hadows of divine right and pa&s;|&s;ive obedience.</P>
<P>He now, therefore, attempted to correct his fir&s;t mi&s;take, and
to peru&s;e the Engli&s;h laws as he had formerly done tho&s;e of his own
country, and by the&s;e he was re&s;olved to govern. He was in this &s;econd
attempt di&s;appointed in his aim: in a government &s;o fluctuating as that of
England, cu&s;|tom was ever deviating from law, and what was enacted in one
reign was contradicted, by prece|dent, in another: the laws and the manners of
England were, at this particular juncture, very different from each other. The
laws had all along declared in favour of an almo&s;t unlimited prero|gative:
the pre&s;ent manners, on the contrary, were formed by in&s;truments, and upon
principles of li|berty. <PB N="301" REF="304"> All the Kings and Queens before
him, except &s;uch as were weakened by inte&s;tine divi|&s;ions, or the dread
of approaching inva&s;ion, i&s;&s;ued rather commands than received advice from
their parliaments: James was early &s;en&s;ible of their con|duct in this
re&s;pect, and &s;trove to e&s;tabli&s;h the pre|rogative upon the laws,
unmindful of the altera|tion of manners among the people, who had, in the reign
of Queen Mary, got an idea of their own power, of which, when the majority are
once &s;en&s;ible, they never de&s;i&s;t from defending.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s, therefore, were the di&s;putes be|tween the King and
his parliament, during this whole reign; one attempting to keep the royal
&s;plendor un&s;ullied, the others aiming at le&s;&s;ening the dangerous part
of his power; the one labour|ing to pre&s;erve the laws and in&s;titutions of
former reigns, the other &s;tedfa&s;t in a&s;&s;erting the inherent privileges
of mankind. Thus we &s;ee virtue was the cau&s;e of the di&s;&s;en&s;ion on
either &s;ide; and the principles of both, though &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, were,
in fact, founded either in law or in rea&s;on. When the parliament would not
grant a &s;ub&s;idy, James had examples enough, among his predece&s;&s;ors, to
extort a benevolence. Edward IV, Henry VIII, and others, had often done this,
and he was intitled, undoubtedly, by precedent, to the &s;ame privilege. The
hou&s;e of commons, on the other hand, who began to find them&s;elves the
protectors of the peo|ple, and not the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of the crown,
ju&s;tly con&s;idered that this extorted benevolence might, at length, make the
Sovereign entirely in|dependent of the parliament, and therefore com|plained
again&s;t it, as an infringement on their pri|vileges. The&s;e attempts of the
crown, and tho&s;e murmurings of the people, continued through this 
<PB N="302" REF="305"> whole reign, and fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to that &s;pirit
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> party, which has ever &s;ince
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted in England; the one &s;ide declaring for the King's
prerogative, the other for the people's liberty.</P>
<P>Whenever the people, as I have already ob&s;erv|ed, get &s;ight of
liberty, they never quit the view: the commons, as may naturally be expected in
the pre&s;ent juncture, gained ground, even though de|feated; and the Monarch,
notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ions and re&s;olutions to keep his prerogative
untouched, was every day lo&s;ing &s;ome &s;mall part of his authority.
Hi&s;torians are apt to charge this to his imbecillity, but it, in reality,
aro&s;e from the &s;pirit of the times: the clergy, who had returned from
bani&s;hment during the la&s;t reign, had di&s;&s;eminated republican
principles among their hearers, and no art nor authority could check its
growth; &s;o that, had the mo&s;t active, or the mo&s;t diligent Monarch upon
earth, been then &s;eated on the throne, yet could he not have pre&s;erved the
ancient privileges of Engli&s;h monarchy unim|paired.</P>
<P>The clemency and the ju&s;tice of this Monarch's reign early
appeared from that &s;pirit of modera|tion which he &s;hewed to the
profe&s;&s;ors of each re|ligion: the minds of the people had been long
irritated again&s;t each other, and each party per&s;e|cuted the re&s;t, as it
happened to prevail; James wi&s;ely ob&s;erved, that men &s;hould be puni&s;hed
on|ly for actions, and not for opinions: each party murmured again&s;t him, and
the univer&s;al complaint of every &s;ect was the be&s;t argument of his
mode|ration towards all.</P>
<P>Yet, mild as he was, there was a project con|trived, in the very
beginning of his reign, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Popery, which &s;eemed
to be <PB N="303" REF="306"> even of infernal extraction: a more horrid, or a
more terrible &s;cheme, never entered into the hu|man mind; the ma&s;&s;acre of
St. Bartholomew, in France, in which &s;ixty thou&s;and Prote&s;tants were
murdered in cold blood, was, in reality, not &s;o dreadful. The Catholics of
England had expect|ed &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ions from the King, which he was
unwilling to grant: this refu&s;al determined them to take different mea&s;ures
for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their religion and their party; they were
re&s;olved to cut off the King and both hou&s;es of parliament at one blow: the
hou&s;e, where the parliament of England &s;its, is built on arched vaults, and
in the&s;e the Papi&s;ts were determined to lay gun-powder, in order to blow up
the King and all the members of both hou&s;es at their next &s;itting. For this
deed of de&s;peration a number of per&s;ons united, among which were Robert
Cate&s;by, Thomas Percy, kin&s;man to the Earl of Northum|berland; John Grant,
Ambro&s;e Rookwood, Chri|&s;topher Wright, Francis Tre&s;ham, Guy Fawkes, and
Everard Digby. How horrid &s;oever the con|trivance, yet every member &s;eemed
faithful and &s;ecret in the league, and, about two months before the &s;itting
of parliament, they hired the cellar un|der the Parliament-hou&s;e, and bought
a quantity of coals with which it was then filled, as if for their own u&s;e:
the next thing done was to convey, privately, thirty-&s;ix barrels of
gun-powder, which had been purcha&s;ed in Holland, and which were covered under
the coals and faggots. The day for the &s;itting of the parliament approached;
never was trea&s;on more &s;ecret, or ruin more apparently inevitable: the
con&s;pirators expected the day with impatience, and gloried in their meditated
guilt. A remor&s;e of private friend&s;hip &s;aved the kingdom, 
<PB N="304" REF="307"> when all the ties, divine and human, were too weak to
&s;ave it: Sir Henry Piercy conceived a de|&s;ire of &s;aving the life of the
Lord Monteagle, his inmate friend and companion. About ten days before the
&s;itting, this nobleman, upon his return home, received a letter from a
per&s;on unknown, the me&s;&s;enger making off as &s;oon as he had deli|vered
it: the letter was to this effect: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Stay away from this parliament, for God and man
have concurred to puni&s;h the wickedne&s;s of the times. Think not &s;lightly
of this warning, though the danger does not appear, yet they &s;hall receive a
terrible blow, without knowing from whence it comes. The danger will be pa&s;t
as &s;oon as you have burnt this letter, and this coun&s;el may do you good,
but cannot do you harm.</HI></Q> The contents of this my&s;|terious letter
&s;urprized and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed: he
communicated it in|&s;tantly to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary
&s;hewed it to the council; none of them were ca|pable of comprehending the
meaning of it, and it was re&s;olved to communicate it to the King. In this
univer&s;al agitation between doubt and appre|hen&s;ion, the King was the
fir&s;t who penetrated the meaning of its fatal contents; he concluded that
&s;ome &s;udden danger was preparing, by means of gun-powder. The Lord
Chamberlain &s;ent proper per&s;ons, the very night before the &s;itting of
par|liament, to examine the vaults above-mentioned: there the whole train of
powder was di&s;covered, and a man in a cloak and boots, with a dark lanthorn
in his hand, preparing the dreadful at|tempt; this was Guy Fawkes, who
pa&s;&s;ed for Piercy's &s;ervant. The atrociou&s;ne&s;s of his guilt
in&s;pired him with re&s;olution; and, with an un|daunted air he told them,
that had he blown them and him&s;elf up together, he had been happy. He 
<PB N="305" REF="308"> ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to name his accomplices; the
&s;ight of the rack, however, at length brought him to a confe&s;&s;ion. No
nation fears death le&s;s than the Engli&s;h, but none dread torments more.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators, who had prepared all things to &s;econd the mine
at We&s;tmin&s;ter, finding their plot di&s;covered, fled different ways to
a&s;&s;emble their Catholic friends, whom they expected to ri&s;e in their
defence: but, the country being every-where alarmed again&s;t them, they were
at la&s;t forced, to the number of about an hundred, to &s;top at an hou&s;e in
Warwick&s;hire, where they were re&s;olved to &s;ell their lives dearly. A
&s;park of fire happening to fall among &s;ome gun-powder that was laid to dry,
it blew up, and &s;o maimed the principal con|&s;pirators, that the &s;urvivors
re&s;olved to open the gate and &s;ally through the multitude that
&s;urround|ed the hou&s;e. Some in&s;tantly were &s;lain with a thou&s;and
wounds; Cate&s;by, Piercy, and Winter, &s;tanding back to back, fought long and
de&s;perate|ly, till, in the end, the two fir&s;t fell covered with blood, and
the other was taken alive. Such as &s;urvived the &s;laughter were tried and
convicted; &s;everal fell ju&s;t victims to ju&s;tice, and others expe|rienced
the King's mercy. Two Je&s;uits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the
plot, &s;uffered with the re&s;t: the King maintained, that they were
puni&s;hed ju&s;tly; but, by their own party, they were regarded as martyrs to
religion, tho' without ground, for James was too humane to condemn any upon
&s;uch &s;light motives, as tho&s;e of opinion.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery and extinction of this con&s;piracy, which was
entirely owing to the wi&s;dom of the King, gained him the love of his
&s;ubjects, though it had but little influence over his parliament, in 
<PB N="306" REF="309"> extoring &s;upplies. His de&s;ire of peace with fo|reign
&s;tates dimini&s;hed his authority at home; for, though he talked boldly of
his prerogative in parliament, yet, unlike &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors, he
had no &s;tanding army to back his preten&s;ions: his &s;peeches, which were
rather arguments in fa|vour of royal authority than directions or advice, only
put both hou&s;es upon arguing with him in his own way, but not upon complying
with his reque&s;ts; and they refu&s;ed him &s;upplies, when they knew it could
be done with impunity. His libe|rality and his indigence often forced him to
con|de&s;cen&s;ions, which, when once granted, could ne|ver be again recalled;
thus, while he thought him|&s;elf enlarging the royal prerogative, he was, in
reality, abridging it on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>Perhaps the oppo&s;ition this King met with from his parliament, was
the motive of his encouraging favourites, who might help him to reduce them to
his mea&s;ures: his fir&s;t choice was fixed upon Ro|bert Carr, who, from a
private gentleman, was brought up, through all the gradations of prefer|ment,
till created Earl of Somer&s;et. An amour between this gentleman and the
Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, one of the lewde&s;t, yet fine&s;t, women of her time,
at la&s;t terminated in his di&s;grace: his friend, Sir Thomas Overbury, had
declared again&s;t his mar|rving this lady, who was e&s;pou&s;ed to another:
this advice procured the re&s;entment of Somer&s;et, and the hatred of the
Counte&s;s. The King, by fal&s;e pretences, was in&s;tigated to confine Sir
Tho|mas in the Tower, and here the Earl and the Counte&s;s cau&s;ed him to be
poi&s;oned. When this tran&s;action came to the King's knowledge, he delivered
him to public ju&s;tice, by which he was <PB N="307" REF="310"> condemned; but
he received the royal pardon, tho' he ever after continued in di&s;grace.</P>
<P>His next, and greate&s;t favourite, was George Villars, afterwards
Duke of Buckingham, who&s;e per&s;on and beauty fir&s;t drew the King's
attention and regard. This nobleman was the fir&s;t who was ever created a Duke
in England, without be|ing allied to the royal family: it may be reckoned among
the mo&s;t capricious circum&s;tances of this reign, that a King, who was bred
a &s;cholar, &s;hould chu&s;e, for his favourites, the mo&s;t illiterate of his
courtiers; that he, who trembled at a drawn &s;word, &s;hould lavi&s;h favours
on one who promi&s;ed to be the hero of a romance. Buckingham fir&s;t
in&s;pired young Prince Charles, who was after|wards famous for his misfortunes
and death, with a de&s;ire of going di&s;gui&s;ed into Spain, to court the
Infanta: their adventures in this romantic expedi|tion could fill novels, and
have actually been made the &s;ubject of many. Charles was the knight-errant,
and Buckingham &s;erved under him as '&s;quire: they &s;et out po&s;t, and
travelled through France under the names of Jack and Tom Smith; they appeared
at Paris in large bu&s;hy perriwigs, which &s;hadowed their faces. They were
received in Spain with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, but Buckingham filled the
whole court with intrigues, adventures, &s;erenades, and jealou&s;y. To make
the folly com|plete, he fell in love with the Duche&s;s of Oliva|rez, the prime
mini&s;ter's wife, and in&s;ulted the prime mini&s;ter. The&s;e levities were
not to be en|dured at &s;uch a court as that of Spain, where jea|lou&s;y is
&s;o prevalent, and decorum &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; the match was broke off, and
the Prince was per|mitted to return in &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="311"> A match for this Prince was &s;oon after
nego|tiated with Henrietta, the daughter of Henry IV. of France, and this met
with better &s;ucce&s;s than the former: Charles had &s;een this Prince&s;s,
when he pa&s;&s;ed through that kingdom in di&s;gui&s;e; he admired her beauty,
and from every quarter was informed of her &s;enfe and di&s;cretion. A
di&s;pen&s;a|tion was got from the Pope for her marrying a Prote&s;tant Prince,
but King James died before the con&s;ummation of the nuptials.</P>
<P>Were we to take the character of this Monarch as de&s;cribed by
Rapin, we &s;hould con&s;ider him as one of the wor&s;t of Princes, even while
he pre|tends to defend him. It is this injudicious hi&s;to|rian's method,
wherever he finds a good character among our Kings, to load it with reproach;
wherever he meets a bad one, to extenuate its guilt, &s;o that every Monarch is
levelled by him to one common &s;tandard of indifference. His re|marks upon
particular facts are &s;imilar to his cha|racters: whatever other hi&s;torians
have laid down as motives, he undertakes to contradict, and fan|cies that he
thus acquires an air of impartiality. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, he
&s;trongly in&s;inuates throughout, that James was a Papi&s;t, with no better
proofs than his being ever a favourer of to|leration: he had but ju&s;t before
blamed Mary, and with rea&s;on, for her implacable partiality, yet he condemns
James only becau&s;e he was impartial. To this Monarch the Engli&s;h are
indebted for that noble freedom of opinion they have &s;ince enjoyed; a
benefit, of which narrow-minded bigots have too often &s;trove to deprive
them.</P>
<P>With regard to foreign negotiations, James nei|ther under&s;tood nor
cultivated them; and perhaps, in the government of &s;uch a kingdom as England,
<PB N="309" REF="312"> dome&s;tic politics alone are requi&s;ite. His reign was
marked with none of the &s;plendors of triumph, nor no new conque&s;ts or
acqui&s;itions; but the arts were neverthele&s;s &s;ilently and happily going
on to improvement: rea&s;on was extending its influence, and &s;hewing mankind
a thou&s;and errors in religion and government, that had been rivetted by long
pre&s;cription. People now no longer joined to &s;ome popular leader, but each
began to think for him&s;elf: the reformation had introduced a &s;pirit of
liberty, even while the con&s;titution and the laws were built upon arbitrary
power. James taught them, by his own example, to argue upon the&s;e topics; he
&s;et up the divine authority of Kings again&s;t the natural privileges of the
people: the &s;ubject began in controver&s;y, and it was &s;oon found that the
Monarch's was the weake&s;t &s;ide.</P>
