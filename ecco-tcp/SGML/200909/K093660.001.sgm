<HEAD>N^o I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man breaks in upon a com|pany of &s;trangers, to which he is not invited, the intru&s;ion does or does not demand an apology, according to the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s which brings him thither: If it im|ports the company only, and he has no intere&s;t in the errand, the le&s;s time he &s;pends in cere|mony the better; and he mu&s;t be a very &s;illy fellow indeed, who &s;tands &s;huffling and apolo|gizing, when he ought either to warn people of their danger, or inform them of their good fortune: But where this is not the ca&s;e, and the man, &s;o intruding, has nothing more to &s;ay for him&s;elf, than that he is come to &s;it down in their company, to prattle and tell &s;tories, and club his &s;hare to the general fe&s;ti|vity
<PB N="2" REF="8">
of the table, it will behove him to recom|mend him&s;elf very &s;peedily to the good graces of his new acquaintance; and if his conver|&s;ation furni&s;hes neither in&s;truction nor amu&s;e|ment, if he &s;tarts no new topics, or does not talk agreeably upon old ones, 'tis well if he does not make his exit as abruptly as he en|tered.</P>
<P>In like manner, every author finds a mate|rial difference in his fir&s;t approaches to the public, whether his &s;ubject recommends him, or he is to recommend his &s;ubject: If he has any thing new in art or &s;cience to produce, any thing important to communicate for the benefit of mankind, he need be under no dif|ficulty in demanding their attention to a bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which it is &s;o much their intere&s;t to hear and under&s;tand; on the contrary, if he has nothing to tell his readers, but what they knew before he told it, there mu&s;t be &s;ome candor on their part, and great addre&s;s on his, to &s;e|cure to &s;uch an author a good reception in the world.</P>
<P>I am at this in&s;tant under all the embar|ra&s;&s;ments incident to a man in the la&s;t-men|tioned predicament: I am exceedingly de&s;i|rous to make my be&s;t bow to the good com|pany
<PB N="3" REF="9">
I am intruding my&s;elf upon, and yet equally anxious, that in &s;o doing I may nei|ther make my fir&s;t advances with the &s;tiff grimace of a dancing-ma&s;ter, nor with the too familiar air of a &s;elf-important. As I pre|tend to nothing more in the&s;e pages, than to tell my readers what I have ob&s;erved of men and books, in the mo&s;t amu&s;ing manner I am able, I know not what to &s;ay to them more than humbly to reque&s;t a hearing; and, as I am in perfect charity and good-humour with them, &s;incerely to hope that they on their parts will be in like good-humour and charity with me.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t wi&s;h was to have followed the &s;teps of tho&s;e E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, who have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;et the fa&s;hion of publi&s;hing their lucubrations from day to day in &s;eparate papers. This mode of marching into the world by detach|ments has been happily taken up by men of great general&s;hip in literature, of whom &s;ome are yet among&s;t us. Though Mr. Addi&s;on, in his Spectator, N^o 124, has a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>a man who publi&s;hes his works in a volume, has an infinite advantage over one who communicates his writings to the world in loo&s;e &s;heets and &s;ingle pieces,</HI> it does not appear that he is &s;erious in
<PB N="4" REF="10">
his a&s;&s;ertion; or, if he is, it is plain that his argument draws one way and his example another; <HI>I mu&s;t confe&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am amazed that the pre&s;s &s;hould be only made u&s;e of in this way by news-writers and the zealots of parties; as if it were not more advantageous to mankind to be in&s;tructed in wi&s;dom and virtue, than in poli|ties; and to be made good fathers, hu&s;bands, and &s;ons, than coun&s;ellors and &s;tate&s;men.</HI> This will &s;uffice to convince us that Mr. Addi&s;on &s;aw the advantages of this mode of publication in &s;uch a light as led him to make choice of it him&s;elf, and to recommend it to others; for it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he would have prefixed a motto to this very paper, purport|ing that <HI>a great book is a great evil,</HI> and then argued &s;eriou&s;ly in recommendation of that evil.</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing volumes now in our hands are collections of e&s;&s;ays publi&s;hed in this manner, and the plan is &s;till capable of a variety, that is in no danger of being ex|hau&s;ted; add to this, that many years have now elap&s;ed &s;ince any papers of this &s;ort have been publi&s;hed: the pre&s;ent time therefore on this account, as well as from other circum|&s;tances peculiar to it, may &s;eem favourable to
<PB N="5" REF="11">
the undertaking: but there are good rea&s;ons, why writers have de&s;i&s;ted from pur&s;uing any further the&s;e attempts of working through a channel, which others are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, who might chance to levy &s;uch a toll upon their merchandize as would effectually &s;poil their market.</P>
<P>The mi&s;cellaneous matter I propo&s;e to give in the&s;e &s;heets naturally coincides with the method I have taken of di&s;po&s;ing them into di&s;tinct papers, and I &s;hall proceed to publi&s;h in like manner till my plan is compleated, or till any unfore&s;een event cuts &s;hort the pro&s;e|cution of it. For me to conceive, in an age &s;o enlightened as the pre&s;ent, that I can offer any thing to the public, which many of my readers will not be as well informed of as my&s;elf, would be a very &s;illy pre&s;umption in|deed: &s;imply to &s;ay that I have written no|thing but with a moral de&s;ign would be &s;aying very little, for it is not the vice of the time to countenance publications of an oppo&s;ite ten|dency; to admini&s;ter moral precepts through a plea&s;ing vehicle &s;eems now the general &s;tudy of our E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, Dramati&s;ts, and Noveli&s;ts. The Preacher may enforce his doctrines in the &s;tile of authority, for it is his profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="6" REF="12">
to &s;ummon mankind to their duty; but an uncommi&s;&s;ioned in&s;tructor will &s;tudy to con|ciliate, whil&s;t he attempts to correct. Even the Satiri&s;t, who declares war again&s;t vice and &s;olly, &s;eldom commits him&s;elf to the attack without keeping &s;ome retiring-place open in the quarter of panegyric; if he cuts deep, it is with the hand of a &s;urgeon, not of an a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in. Few authors now undertake to mend the world by &s;everity, many make it their &s;tudy by &s;ome new and ingenious device to &s;often the rigour of philo&s;ophy, and to bind the rod of the morali&s;t with the ro&s;es of the mu&s;e.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to relieve and chequer the&s;e familiar e&s;&s;ays in a manner that I hope will be approved of; I allude to tho&s;e papers, in which I treat of the literature of the Greeks, carrying down my hi&s;tory in a chain of anec|dotes from the earlie&s;t poets to the death of Menander; to this part of my work I have addre&s;&s;ed my greate&s;t pains and attention. I believe the plan is &s;o far my own, that nobody has yet given the account in &s;o compre&s;&s;ed and unmixt a &s;tate as I &s;hall do, and none I think will envy me the labour of turning over &s;uch a ma&s;s of heavy materials for the &s;ake of &s;e|lecting what I hoped would be acceptable in
<PB N="7" REF="13">
the relation. Though I cannot &s;uppo&s;e I am free from error, I can &s;afely &s;ay I have a&s;&s;erted nothing without authority; but it did not &s;uit the purpo&s;e of the work to make a di&s;play of tho&s;e authorities, as it was my wi&s;h to level it to readers of all de&s;criptions. The tran&s;la|tions I &s;hall occa&s;ionally give will be of &s;uch authors, or rather fragments of authors, as come under few people's review, and have never been &s;een in an Engli&s;h ver&s;ion; the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages therefore will have the merit of no|velty at lea&s;t with mo&s;t readers, and if I &s;ucceed in naturalizing to any degree authors, who&s;e names only float among&s;t us, I &s;hall not think that what has been the heavie&s;t part of my undertaking has been the mo&s;t unprofitable. As I mean this to be a kind of <HI>liber circum|currens,</HI> I have thought it not ami&s;s to intitle it <HI>The Ob&s;erver.</HI></P>

<HEAD>N^o II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a pretty numerous &s;ect of philo&s;ophers in this kingdom, whom I cannot de&s;cribe by any apter denomination, than that of <HI>Dampers.</HI> They are to be known
<PB N="8" REF="14">
in &s;ociety by a &s;udden damp, which they are &s;ure to ca&s;t upon all companies, where they enter. The human heart, that comes within their atmo&s;phere, never fails to be chilled; and the quicke&s;t &s;en&s;e of feeling is as effectually benumb'd, as the touch is with the torpedo. As this &s;ect is of very ancient &s;tanding in the world, and has been taken notice of by &s;eve|ral heathen writers, I have &s;ometimes thought that it might originate in the &s;chool of Thales, who held water to be the fir&s;t principle of all things. If I were certain that this ancient philo&s;opher always admini&s;tered his water cold to his di&s;ciples, I &s;hould incline to think the pre&s;ent &s;ect of <HI>Dampers</HI> was really a branch from the Thale&s;ian root, for it is certain they make great u&s;e of his fir&s;t principle in the phi|lo&s;ophy they practi&s;e.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e philo&s;ophers in &s;ociety is to check the flights and &s;allies of tho&s;e vo|latile beings, who are &s;ubject to be carried away by imagination and fancy, or, in other words, to act as a counterpoi&s;e again&s;t genius; of the vices of mankind they take little notice, but they are at great pains to correct their vanity. They have various receipts for curing this evil; the ordinary method is by keeping
<PB N="9" REF="15">
&s;tern &s;ilence and an unmoved vi&s;age in com|panies which are di&s;po&s;ed to be chearful. This taciturnity, if well kept up, never fails in the end to work a cure upon fe&s;tivity ac|cording to the fir&s;t principle of Thales: if the <HI>Damper</HI> looks moro&s;e, every body wonders what the moody gentleman is di&s;plea&s;ed with, and each in his turn &s;u&s;pects him&s;elf in the fault; if he only looks wi&s;e, all are expecting when the dumb oracle will utter, and in the mean time his &s;ilence infects the whole circle; if the <HI>Damper</HI> &s;ea&s;ons his taciturnity with a &s;hrug of the &s;houlders, or a &s;hake of the head, judiciou&s;ly thrown in, when any talkative fel|low rai&s;es a laugh, 'tis ten to one if the mor|tified wit ever opens his mouth again for that evening; if a &s;tory is told in his company, and the teller makes a &s;lip in a date, or a name, a true <HI>Damper</HI> may open, provided it is done agreably to the rules of his order, by &s;etting the &s;tory-teller right with much gravity, and adju&s;ting the mi&s;take &s;o deliberately, that the &s;pirit of the &s;tory &s;hall be &s;ure to evaporate, before the commentator has properly &s;ettled his correction of the text. If any lucky wit chances to &s;ay what is called a <HI>good thing,</HI> and the table applauds, it is a <HI>Damper</HI>'s duty to
<PB N="10" REF="16">
a&s;k an explanation of the joke, or whether that was all, and what t'other gentleman &s;aid, who was the butt of the je&s;t, and other proper que&s;tions of the like &s;ort. If one of the com|pany ri&s;ques a &s;ally for the &s;ake of good-fel|low&s;hip, which is a little on the wrong &s;ide of truth, or not &s;trictly reducible to proof, a <HI>Damper</HI> may with great propriety &s;et him right in the matter of fact, and demon&s;trate, as clear as two and two make four, that what he has &s;aid may be mathematically confuted, and that the merry gentleman is mi&s;taken. A <HI>Damper</HI> is to keep &s;trict watch over the morals of the company, and not to &s;uffer the lea&s;t indi&s;cretion to e&s;cape in the warmth of conviviality; on this occa&s;ion he mu&s;t be rea|dy to call to order, and to an&s;wer for his friend to the company, that he has better principles than he affects to have; that he &s;hould be &s;or|ry &s;uch and &s;uch an opinion went out again&s;t him; and that he is certain he forgot him&s;elf, when he &s;aid &s;o and &s;o. If any glance is made at private characters, however notorious, a <HI>Damper</HI> &s;teps in with a recommendation of candour, and inveighs mo&s;t pathetically again&s;t the &s;in of evil-&s;peaking. He is never merry in company, except when any one in it is ap|parently
<PB N="11" REF="17">
out of &s;pirits, and with &s;uch an one he is always exceedingly plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>A <HI>Damper</HI> is &s;o profe&s;t an enemy to flattery, that he never applies it in ever &s;o &s;mall a degree even to the mo&s;t diffident: he never chears a young author for fear of marring his mode&s;ty, never &s;inks truths becau&s;e they are di&s;agreable, and if any one is ra&s;hly enjoying the tran&s;ports of public fame on account of &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful production in art or &s;cience, the <HI>Damper</HI> kindly tells him what &s;uch and &s;uch a critic has &s;coffingly &s;aid on the occa|&s;ion, and, if nothing better offers, lowers his triumphs with a paragraph from a news-paper, which his thoughtle&s;s friend might el&s;e have overlooked. He is remarkably careful not to &s;poil young people by making allowances for &s;pirits or inexperience, or by indulging them in an opinion of their per&s;ons or accompli&s;h|ments. He has many excellent apothegms in his mouth ready to recommend to tho&s;e, who want them, &s;uch as <HI>to be merry and wi&s;e;&mdash;a grain of truth is better than an ounce of wit;&mdash;a fool's bolt is &s;oon &s;hot, but a wi&s;e man keeps his within the quiver;&mdash;he that was only taught by him&s;elf had a fool to his ma&s;ter</HI>;&mdash;and many more of the like &s;ort.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>PLINY to RESTITUTUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MELMOTH's Tran&s;lation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>I cannot forbear pouring out my indignation before you in a letter, &s;ince I have no opportunity of doing &s;o in per&s;on, again&s;t a certain behaviour which gave me &s;ome offence in an a&s;&s;embly, where I was lately pre&s;ent. The company was enter|tained with the recital of a very fini&s;hed per|formance; but there were two or three per&s;ons among the audience, men of great genius in their own and a few of their friends e&s;timation, who &s;at like &s;o many mutes, without &s;o much as moving a lip or a hand, or once ri&s;ing from their &s;eats, even to &s;hift their po&s;ture. But to what purpo&s;e, in the name of good &s;en&s;e, all this wondrous air of wi&s;dom and &s;olemnity, or rather indeed (to give it its true appellation) of this proud indo|lence? Is it not downright folly, or even madne&s;s, thus to be at the expence of a whole day merely to commit a piece of rudene&s;s, and leave him an enemy, whom you vi&s;ited as a friend? Is a man
<PB N="13" REF="19">
con&s;cious that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;uperior degree of eloquence than the per&s;on whom he attends upon on &s;uch an occa&s;ion? So much the rather ought he to guard again&s;t every appearance of envy, as a pa&s;&s;ion that always implies inferiority, wherever it re&s;ides. But whatever a man's ta|lent may be, whether greater or equal or le&s;s than his friend's, &s;till it is his intere&s;t to give him the approbation he de&s;erves: if greater or equal, becau&s;e the higher his glory ri&s;es, whom you equal or excel, the more con&s;iderable yours mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be; if le&s;s, becau&s;e if one of more exalted abilities does not meet with applau&s;e, nei|ther po&s;&s;ibly can you. For my own part, I ho|nour and revere all, who di&s;cover any degree of merit in the painful and laborious art of oratory; for eloquence is a high and haughty dame, who &s;corns to re&s;ide with tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e her. But perhaps you are not of this opinion; yet who has a greater regard for this glorious &s;cience, or is a more candid judge of it than your&s;elf? In con|fidence of which, I cho&s;e to vent my indignation particularly to you, as not doubting you would be the fir&s;t to &s;hare with me in the &s;ame &s;entiments.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Farewell.</SALUTE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">The Romans were much in the habit of reading their unpubli&s;hed performances to &s;e|lect parties, and &s;ometimes no doubt put the patience and politene&s;s of their hearers to a &s;evere trial: I conceive that this practice does not obtain to any great degree among&s;t us at pre&s;ent; neither is it a thing to be recom|mended to young authors, except under pecu|liar circum&s;tances; for they certainly expo&s;e them&s;elves and their hearers to a &s;ituation very delicate at be&s;t, and which &s;ometimes leads to unplea&s;ant con&s;equences. I am aware how much is to be expected from the judicious re|marks of a critic, who will correct <HI>with all the malice of a friend</HI>; yet a man &s;o qualified and di&s;po&s;ed is not ea&s;ily found, and does not often fall within the li&s;t of an author's ac|quaintance; men, who read their works in circles, or to any but the mo&s;t &s;elect friends, read for no other purpo&s;e but for admiration and applau&s;e; they cannot po&s;&s;ibly expect cri|tici&s;m, and it is accordingly agreed upon by all, but the &s;ect of the <HI>Dampers,</HI> either to keep out of &s;uch circles, or to pay their quota when the reckoning is ca&s;t up. Few, but men of quick and lively parts, are forward to recite in &s;uch &s;ocieties, and the&s;e are the very men,
<PB N="15" REF="21">
who are mo&s;t pained by neglect; for I think it is a remark, with as few exceptions to it as mo&s;t general remarks have, that brilliant ta|lents are attended with extreme &s;en&s;ibility, and the effects of &s;en&s;ibility bear &s;uch re&s;em|blance to the effects of vanity, that the un|di&s;cerning multitude are too apt to confound them. The&s;e are the men, who, in their pro|gre&s;s through life, are mo&s;t frequently mi&s;|under&s;tood, and generally le&s;s pitied than they ought to be.</P>
<P>Now a <HI>Damper</HI> will tell you that he is con|&s;ulting &s;uch a man's good, and lowering his vanity, when he is &s;porting with his feelings, and will take merit to him&s;elf for the di&s;cipline he gives him; but humanity will reflect, that the &s;ame &s;pirits, which are prone to exult upon &s;ucce&s;s, are proportionably agonized by the failure of it, and will therefore prompt us to a gentler treatment of &s;uch per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;ums which are expended in this nation upon tho&s;e refined enjoyments, which are pro|duced by the expertne&s;s of the hands and the ingenuity of the head, are certainly very great; and men are therefore apt to exclaim,

mea&s;ure of encouragement, there could be no di&s;pute in the ca&s;e; but &s;o long as men have a feeling for their pride, as well as for their pocket, money alone will not encourage and promote the genius of a nation; it is the grace of doing a favour, which con&s;titutes its merit; it is from the manners of the great that the man of ri&s;ing talents is to draw that in&s;piriting con&s;ideration of him&s;elf, that &s;ti|mulating pride of nature, which are to pu&s;h his efforts towards perfection.</P>
<P>A limner will take a canva&s;s and chalk out a man's face he has never &s;een before, and hang on his robes, or his garter, if he has one, or will put a hor&s;e in his hand, if he likes it better, or make a battle in the back ground, if he was ever within hearing of one, and when the job is fini&s;hed will be paid the price of his labour, like any other mechanic; the money he may &s;pend or put to u&s;e, and, if cu&s;tomers come in, he may rai&s;e his price upon them, and the world may call tho&s;e pro|fits an encouragement; but the painter is &s;till a trade&s;man, and his fitter, not a patron, but a cu&s;tomer: The mercer, who&s;e dama&s;k clothes the walls of the nobleman's &s;aloon, and the arti&s;t, who&s;e pictures hang round it, are in the

<P>As I have made this remark with a refer|ence to the <HI>Dampers</HI> in high life, I am aware that there are many eminent encouragers of the arts and &s;ciences among&s;t the rich and libe|ral; nay &s;o general is their protection, that it comprehends a numerous importation of exo|tic tooth-drawers, dancers, and milliners, who find that England is the nur&s;ery of genius: even the magnifying philo&s;opher of Piccadilly (unle&s;s he multiplies as well as magnifies) has &s;hewn his <HI>wonders</HI> &s;o frequently and to &s;uch prodigious numbers, that it is to be doubted, if they &s;hall continue to be <HI>wonders</HI> much longer.</P>

<P>THE de&s;ire of prai&s;e is natural, but when that appetite becomes canine, it is no longer in nature: a ta&s;te of it is plea&s;ant to mo&s;t men; temperance it&s;elf will take a little, but the &s;tomach &s;ickens with a &s;urfeit of it, and the palate nau&s;eates the debauch.</P>
<P>Let the pa&s;&s;ion for flattery be ever &s;o inor|dinate, the &s;upply can keep pace with the de|mand, and in the world's great market, in which wit and folly drive their bargains with each other, there are traders of all &s;orts; &s;ome keep a &s;tall of offals, &s;ome a &s;torehou&s;e of de|licacies; a &s;queami&s;h palate mu&s;t be forced by alluring provocatives, a foul feeder will &s;wal|low any tra&s;h that he can get hold of.</P>
<P>In a recent publication of the hi&s;tory of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, written by Sepul|veda of Cordova (a contemporary and favorite of that famous monarch,) the Academy of Hi&s;tory at Madrid in their dedication to his pre&s;ent Catholic Maje&s;ty, addre&s;s him in the following words&mdash;<HI>Nam quem tu, Carole Rex, ut nomine refers, ita etiam bellic&acirc; laude jampri|dem aemularis.</HI> When the&s;e courtly academi|cians
<PB N="20" REF="26">
have thus mounted their peaceable &s;o|vereign on the war-hor&s;e of the victorious Charles, they &s;eriou&s;ly proceed to tell him, that <HI>being fully equal to his predece&s;&s;or in his martial character, he is out of all di&s;tance &s;u|perior to him in every other kingly quality; more wi&s;e, more politic, more magnanimous, and (as the pre&s;ent work can te&s;tify) a greater friend to learning than all that ever went before him, and, if they may ri&s;que a prediction, there will pro|bably be none to come in competition with him hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>If his Catholic Maje&s;ty &s;hall ever come to an under&s;tanding of this paragraph, and &s;trike a fair compari&s;on between him&s;elf and his il|lu&s;trious name&s;ake, I &s;hould not be &s;urprized if the next work his academicians &s;hall be em|ployed in proves the fortifications of Ceuta.</P>
<P>When I compare the &s;tate of flattery in a free country with that, which obtains in arbi|trary &s;tates, it is a con&s;olation to find that this mean principle is not natural to mankind; for it certainly abates in proportion as independency advances. This will be very evident to any one, who compares the flattery of Elizabeth's and James's days with the pre&s;ent. Ben John&s;on for in&s;tance was a &s;urly poet, yet how ful&s;ome

<L>But is pure harmony.</L></Q></P>
<P>This poet, though he was rather a clum&s;y flatterer of his prince, was ingenious enough in the mode he took for flattering him&s;elf, by introducing a kind of chorus, wherein he takes occa&s;ion to tell his hearers, that <HI>carele&s;s of all vulgar cen&s;ure, as not depending on com|mon approbation, he is confident his plays &s;hall &s;uper-plea&s;e judicious &s;pectators, and to them he leaves it to work with the re&s;t by example, or otherwi&s;e.</HI> It is remarkable that this pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be found in his <HI>Magnetic Lady,</HI> and that he &s;hould &s;peak with &s;uch confidence of one of his wor&s;t productions, as if he was deter|mined to force a bad comedy upon the hear|ers by the authority of his own recommenda|tion. This is an evident imitation of Ari&s;to|phanes, who in his comedy of <HI>The Clouds</HI> holds the &s;ame language to his audience, fairly tell|ing them <HI>he &s;hall e&s;timate their judgment accord|ing</HI>

<HI>to the degree of applau&s;e they &s;hall be&s;tow upon his performance then before them:</HI> in con|clu&s;ion he inveighs again&s;t certain of his con|temporaries, Eupolis, Phrynichus, and Her|mippus, <HI>with who&s;e comedies if any of his audi|ence is well plea&s;ed, that per&s;on he hopes will de|part from his di&s;&s;atisfied; but if they condemn his rivals, and applaud him, he &s;hall think better of their judgment for the future.

<P>The caution authors now proceed with &s;hews the refinement of the times; &s;till they can contrive in a mode&s;t way to &s;ay civil things of them&s;elves, and it would be hard indeed to di&s;appoint them of &s;o &s;light a grati|fication&mdash;for what prai&s;e is &s;o little to be en|vied, as that which a man be&s;tows on him&s;elf? Several of our diurnal E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts have contrived under the veil of fiction to hook in &s;omething recommendatory of them&s;elves, which they mean &s;hould pa&s;s for truth; &s;uch is the intel|ligent taciturnity of the Spectator, and the &s;olemn integrity of the Guardian.</P>
<P>The latter in one of his papers notices the ambition of &s;ome authors to prefix engravings of their portraits to their title pages; his ridi|cule has not quite laughed this fa&s;hion out of countenance, for I perceive it is &s;till in exi&s;t|ence,

and I frequently meet the face of an old acquaintance looking through the windows of a book&s;eller's &s;hop.

In the &s;ame &s;hop window with this gentleman I ob&s;erved with great plea&s;ure an elegant author &s;tanding by him, as erect as a dart, firm and collected in the awful moment of beginning a <HI>minuet.</HI> I own I regret that the hone&s;t butler, who has regaled the age with <HI>a treati&s;e on ale and &s;trong beer,</HI> has not hung out his own head in the front of his book, as a &s;ign of the <HI>good enter|tainment</HI> within.</P>
<P>But of all the in&s;tances of face-flattery I have lately met with, that of a worthy citizen &s;urprized me mo&s;t, who&s;e compting-hou&s;e I entered the other day, and found an enormous portrait of my friend in a flaming drapery of blue and gold, mounted upon the back of a war-hor&s;e, which the limner has made to rear &s;o furiou&s;ly, that I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee my friend, who is no great jockey, keep his &s;eat &s;o &s;teadily: he confe&s;&s;ed to me that he had con&s;ented to be drawn on hor&s;eback to plea&s;e his wife and daughters, who cho&s;e the attitude;

for his own part it made him quite giddy to look at him&s;elf, and he frequently de&s;ired the painter not to let the hor&s;e prance &s;o, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Too great avidity of prai&s;e will &s;ometimes betray an author into a &s;tudied attempt at fine writing, where the thought will not carry the &s;tile; writers of this &s;ort are like tho&s;e ta&s;te|le&s;s dabblers in architecture, who turn the gable-ends of barns and cottages into ca&s;tles and temples, and &s;pend a world of plai&s;tering and pains to decorate a pig-&s;tye. They bring to my mind a ridiculous &s;cene, at which I was pre&s;ent the other day; I found a lady of my acquaintance bu&s;ily employed in the dome&s;tic education of her only &s;on; the preceptor was in the room, and was &s;tanding in an attitude very much re&s;embling the erect gentleman I had &s;een that morning in the book&s;eller's win|dow: The boy kept his eyes fixt, and &s;eemed to govern his motions by certain &s;ignals of the feet and arms, which he repeated from the preceptor. In the cour&s;e of my conver&s;ation with his mother, I chanced to drop my glove upon the floor, upon which he approached to pick it up, but in a &s;tep &s;o mea&s;ured and me|thodical, that I had done the office for my&s;elf,
<PB N="25" REF="31">
before he had performed his advances. As I was about to re&s;ume the conver&s;ation, the mother interrupted me, by de&s;iring I would favour her &s;o far as to drop my glove again, that Bobby might have the honour of pre&s;ent|ing it to me in proper form: All this while the boy &s;tood as upright as an arrow, perfectly motionle&s;s; but no &s;ooner had I thrown down my gauntlet, than he began to put one foot &s;lowly in advance before the other; upon which the preceptor of politene&s;s cried out, <HI>One!&mdash;Fir&s;t po&s;ition!</HI>&mdash;The boy then made another movement of his feet, upon which the ma&s;ter repeated&mdash;<HI>Two!&mdash;Second po&s;ition!</HI>&mdash;This was followed by another, and the echo again cried out&mdash;<HI>Three! very well&mdash;Third po|&s;ition! Bend your body &s;lowly!</HI>&mdash;At the word of command the automaton bent its body very deliberately, its arms hanging down in paral|lel perpendiculars to the floor, like the fore|legs of a quadruped. The glove being now taken up by the right hand, was placed with great decorum upon the back of the left hand; the trunk of the animal was &s;lowly re&s;tored to its erect po&s;ition, and the glove pre&s;ented with all due &s;olemnity. As I was in hopes the ceremony was now over, upon hearing
<PB N="26" REF="32">
the teacher cry <HI>bravo!</HI> I thought it time to make my compliment of <HI>Thank you, pretty Ma&s;ter!</HI> but I was again in a mi&s;take, for the mother begged me not to hurry her dear Bobby, but allow him time to make his bow, and &s;till hold the glove in my hand: This was an opera|tion of no &s;light con&s;equence, for in the time it took him up, a nimble arti&s;t might have made the glove: At la&s;t however it was over, and the boy was putting him&s;elf in order of retreat, when the ma&s;ter ob&s;erving that I had omitted the nece&s;&s;ary bend of my wri&s;t upon receiving the glove, for want of which the whole had been imperfect, propo&s;ed a repetition of the manoeuvre, in which Bobby &s;hould be the dropper, and him&s;elf the picker up of the glove. This propo&s;al &s;truck me with &s;uch horror, that taking a ha&s;ty leave of the lady, in which, fir&s;t, &s;econd and third po&s;ition were probably huddled all together, I departed, re|peating to my&s;elf in the words of Foigard, <HI>All this may be very fine, but upon my &s;oul it is very ridiculous.</HI></P>

<P>LADY THIMBLE is one of tho&s;e fe|male pedants, who with quick animal &s;pi|rits, a pert imagination, great &s;elf-conceit, and a homely per&s;on, &s;ets her&s;elf up for a woman of talents: She has as much of the learned languages, as a boarding-&s;chool girl carries home of French upon her fir&s;t holidays, when Mi&s;s a&s;&s;ures you &s;he can call for what &s;he wants, and, though &s;he wont utter a word in the parlour from pretended mode&s;ty, in&s;ults the ignorance of the chambermaid with an eternal jargon of bad grammar, wor&s;e pro|nounced. This learned lady is the only child of a wealthy trader of the city of London, who, having never advanced in his own edu|cation beyond the erudition of the compting-hou&s;e, took care his daughter &s;hould be in|&s;tructed in every thing he did not under&s;tand him&s;elf, and as the girl grew exceedingly vain of the applau&s;e of the pedagogue, who read to her, the merchant grew as vain of the &s;cholar|&s;hip of his child, and would li&s;ten to the &s;ound of Latin or Greek with as much &s;uper&s;titious

<P>Mi&s;s in the mean time became an in&s;uffer|able &s;lattern in her cloaths and per&s;on, her handkerchiefs and aprons were full of iron-moulds from the drippings of the inkhorn, and her &s;tockings full of holes from her neglect of the needle: The&s;e were in fact badges of af|fectation rather than of over&s;ight, and you could not pay your court to her better than by rallying her about them. She wore a head of fal&s;e hair, not becau&s;e her own was thin, but becau&s;e a wig was thrown on in an in|&s;tant; this was &s;ometimes done with a negli|gence, that &s;eemed &s;tudied, and when the learned Vento&s;us vouch&s;afed to vi&s;it her, &s;he was &s;ure to wear her wig awry, as Alexander's courtiers did their heads, in honour of her gue&s;t: There was indeed an un&s;eemly hu|mour &s;ettled in her no&s;e, but this &s;he got by &s;tudying <HI>Locke upon the human under&s;tanding</HI> after dinner; before &s;he could develope the whole doctrine of <HI>innate ideas,</HI> the humour deepened many &s;hades, which however on the whole may be allowed to be getting off pret|ty well for a &s;tudent in metaphy&s;ics.

<P>Her works are pretty voluminous, e&s;pecial|ly in manu&s;cript; but cen&s;orious people affect to whi&s;per, that &s;he performed one work in concert with the pedant her ma&s;ter, and that, though this compo&s;ition was brought &s;ecretly into the world, it is the only one of her pro|ducing, that bids fair for po&s;terity: This &s;tory and the remark upon it, I had from a lady, who is one of her intimate friends, but &s;he a&s;&s;ured me &s;he gave no credit to it her&s;elf, and con&s;idered all &s;uch &s;candalous in&s;inuations as the effects of malice and envy.</P>

the bands of wedlock to Sir Theodore Thim|ble: This gentleman had been lately dubbed a knight for his &s;ervices to the crown in bringing up a county addre&s;s; his father, Mr. David Thimble, had been an eminent taylor in the precincts of St. Clements, in which bu&s;ine&s;s he had by his indu&s;try and other me|thods rai&s;ed a very re&s;pectable fortune in mo|ney, book-debts and remnants: In his latter years Mr. Thimble purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in E&s;&s;ex with a fine old man&s;ion upon it, the la&s;t remaining property of an ancient family. This venerable &s;eat during the life of Mr. Thimble remained uncontaminated by the pre&s;ence of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but upon his death it fell into the occupation of young Theodore, who di&s;daining the cro&s;s-legg'd art, by which his father had worked him&s;elf into opulence, &s;et out upon a new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and figured off as the fir&s;t gentleman of his family: He &s;erved as &s;heriff of the county, and acquired great reputation in that high office by the elegant and well cut liveries, which he exhibited at the a&s;&s;izes; a lucky ad|dre&s;s from the county gave him a title, and the recommendation of a good &s;ettlement pro|cured

<P>As I have been in long habits of friend&s;hip with the worthy citizen her father, I could not re&s;i&s;t the many pre&s;&s;ing invitations he gave me to pay a vi&s;it to his daughter and Sir Theodore at their country &s;eat, e&s;pecially as he prefaced it by a&s;&s;uring me I &s;hould &s;ee the happie&s;t couple in England; and that, altho' I had frequently oppo&s;ed his &s;y&s;tem of educa|tion, I &s;hould now be convinced that Arabella made as good a hou&s;ewife and under&s;tood the conduct of her family as well, as if &s;he had &s;tudied nothing el&s;e, and this he was &s;ure I would confe&s;s, if he could prevail with me to accompany him to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the day following this conver&s;ation we &s;et out together, and in a few hours found our&s;elves at the promi&s;ed &s;pot: As I remem|bered this fine old man&s;ion in the days of its primitive &s;implicity, when I was u&s;hered to its gate through a &s;olemn avenue of branching elms, that arched over head in lofty foliage, and formed an approach in perfect uni&s;on with the ancient fa&s;hion of the place, I mu&s;t own I was much revolted to find that Sir Theodore had begun his improvements with a &s;pecimen

of his father's art, by cutting an old coat into a new fa&s;hion: My favorite avenue no longer exi&s;ted; the venerable tenants of the &s;oil were rooted up, and a parcel of dotted clumps, compo&s;ed of trumpery &s;hrubs, &s;ub&s;tituted in their places; I was the more di&s;gu&s;ted, when I perceived that by the non&s;en&s;ical zigzaggery of the road, through which we meandered, I was to keep company with the&s;e new-fa&s;hion|ed up&s;tarts through as many parallels, as would &s;erve for the regular approaches to a citadel. At one of the&s;e turnings however I caught the glimp&s;e of a well-dre&s;&s;ed gentleman &s;tand|ing in a very becoming attitude, who I con|cluded mu&s;t be the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion waiting our approach; and as I perceived he had his hat under his arm, expecting us with great politene&s;s and civility, I in&s;tantly took mine from my head, and called to our driver to &s;top the carriage, for that I perceived Sir Theodore was come out to meet us. My companion was at this time exceedingly bu&s;y in directing my attention to the beauties of his &s;on-in-law's improvements, &s;o that I had &s;topped the chai&s;e before he ob&s;erved what I was looking at; but how was I &s;urprized to find, in place of Sir Theodore, a leaden

I was happy to find that this ridiculous mi&s;take, in&s;tead of embarra&s;&s;ing my friend, occa&s;ioned infinite merriment, and was con&s;idered as &s;o good a joke by all the family upon our arrival, that I am per&s;uaded it was in the mind of the improver when he placed him there; for the je&s;t was followed up by &s;everal other party-coloured per&s;onages ca&s;t to the life, gentlemen and ladies, who were airing them&s;elves upon pe|de&s;tals to the no &s;mall delight of my compa|nion; and though mo&s;t of the&s;e wittici&s;ms in lead were of the comic ca&s;t, one group, of a mountebank in the act of drawing an old wo|man's tooth, was calculated to move the con|trary pa&s;&s;ion; and this I ob&s;erved was the la&s;t in the company, &s;tanding in view from the windows of the hou&s;e, as the moral of the fa|ble. We now entered a Chine&s;e fence thro'

a gate of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, to the &s;ide of which was affixed a board, on which I ob&s;erved at &s;ome di&s;tance a writing in fair characters; this I &s;u&s;pected to be &s;ome cla&s;&s;ical text, which my Lady had &s;et up to impre&s;s her vi&s;iters with a due re&s;pect for her learning, but upon a near approach I found it contained a warn|ing to all interlopers, that men-traps and &s;pring-guns were concealed in tho&s;e walks.</P>
<P>In this dangerous defile we were encoun|tered by a &s;ervant in livery, who was di&s;patch|ed in great ha&s;te to &s;top our driver, and de&s;ire us to alight, as the gravel was newly laid down, and a late &s;hower had made it very &s;oft; my friend readily obeyed the arre&s;t, but I confe&s;s the denunciation of traps and guns was &s;o formidable to my mind, that I took no &s;tep but with great circum&s;pection and fore|ca&s;t, for fear I was treading on a mine, or touching a &s;pring with my foot, and was hear|tily glad, when I found my&s;elf on the &s;teps, though even the&s;e I examined with &s;ome &s;u&s;|picion before I tru&s;ted my&s;elf upon them.</P>

<P>OUR vi&s;it to Sir Theodore and Lady Thimble being unexpected, we were &s;hewn into the common parlour, where this happy couple were &s;itting over a good fire with a middle-aged man of athletic &s;ize, who was repo&s;ing in an elbow chair in great &s;tate with his mull in his hand, and with an air &s;o &s;elf-important, as plainly indicated him to be the dictator of this dome&s;tic circle.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, Lady Thimble gave her orders to the &s;ervant, in the &s;tile of Lucullus, to prepare <HI>The Apollo,</HI> decla|ring her&s;elf a&s;hamed to receive a gentleman of talents in any other apartment; I be&s;eeched her to let us remain where we were, dreading a removal from a comfortable fire-&s;ide to a cold &s;tately apartment, for the &s;ea&s;on was &s;evere; I was &s;o earne&s;t in my reque&s;t, that Sir Theo|dore ventured in the mo&s;t humble manner to
<PB N="36" REF="42">
&s;econd my &s;uit; the con&s;equence of which was a &s;mart reprimand, accompanied with one of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive looks, which ladies of high prerogative in their own hou&s;es occa&s;ionally be&s;tow to hu&s;bands under proper &s;ubjection, and I &s;aw with pity the poor gentleman di&s;|patched for his officiou&s;ne&s;s upon a freezing errand through a great hall, to &s;ee that things were &s;et in order, and make report, when they were ready. I could not help giving my friend the merchant a &s;ignificant look upon this occa|&s;ion; but he prudently kept &s;ilence, waiting with great re&s;pect the dreadful order of march.</P>
<P>My Lady now introduced me to the athle|tic philo&s;opher in the elbow-chair, who con|de&s;cended to relax one half of his features into a &s;mile, and with a gracious waving of his hand, or rather fi&s;t, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me back again to my &s;eat without uttering a &s;yllable. She then informed me, that &s;he had a treat to give me, which &s;he flattered her&s;elf would be a fea&s;t entirely to my palate; I a&s;&s;ured her Lady&s;hip I was always happie&s;t to take the family-din|ner of my friends, adding that in truth the &s;harp air had &s;ufficiently whetted my appetite to recommend much humbler fare, than I was likely to find at her table. She &s;miled at this,
<PB N="37" REF="43">
and told me it was the food of the mind that &s;he was about to provide for me; &s;he under|took for nothing el&s;e; culinary concerns were not her province; if I was hungry, &s;he hoped there would be &s;omething to eat, but for her part &s;he left the care of her kitchen to tho&s;e who lived in it. Whil&s;t &s;he was &s;aying this methought the philo&s;opher gave her a look, that &s;eemed to &s;ay he was of my way of think|ing; upon which &s;he rung the bell, and order|ed dinner to be held back for an hour, &s;aying to the philo&s;opher &s;he thought we might have <HI>a Canto</HI> in that time.</P>
<P>She now pau&s;ed for &s;ome time, fixing her eyes upon him in expectation of an an&s;wer; but none being given, nor any &s;ignal of a&s;&s;ent, &s;he ro&s;e, and, ob&s;erving that <HI>it was &s;urprizing to think what Sir Theodore could be about all this while, for &s;he was &s;ure</HI> The Apollo <HI>mu&s;t be ready,</HI> without more delay bade us follow her; <HI>Come, Sir,</HI> &s;ays &s;he to me, as I pa&s;&s;ed the great hall with an aking heart and chattering teeth, <HI>you &s;hall now have a treat in your own ta&s;te</HI>; and, meeting one of the dome&s;tics by the way, bade him tell Calliope to come into <HI>The Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;et my foot into the room, I was
<PB N="38" REF="44">
immediately &s;aluted by &s;omething like one of tho&s;e ungenial breezes, which travellers in|form us have the faculty of putting an end to life and all its cares at a &s;troke: A fire indeed had been lighted, which poor Sir Theodore was &s;oliciting into a blaze, working the bel|lows with might and main to little purpo&s;e; for the billets were &s;o wet, that Apollo him&s;elf with all his beams would have been foiled to &s;et them in a flame: The hone&s;t gentleman had taken the precaution of opening all the windows, in &s;pite of which no atom of &s;moke pa&s;&s;ed up the chimney, but came curling into the room in columns as thick, as if a hecatomb had been offering to the &s;hrine of Delphi; in|deed this was not much to be wondered at, for I &s;oon di&s;covered that a board had been fixed acro&s;s the flue of the chimney, which Sir Theodore in his attention to the bellows had neglected to ob&s;erve: I was again the unhap|py cau&s;e of that poor gentleman's unmerited rebuke, and in terms much &s;everer than be|fore; it was to no purpo&s;e he attempted to bring Su&s;an the hou&s;e-maid in for &s;ome &s;hare of the blame; his plea was di&s;allowed; and though I mu&s;t own it was not the mo&s;t man|ly defence in the world, yet, con&s;idering the
<PB N="39" REF="45">
unhappy culprit as the &s;on of a taylor, I thought it not entirely inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When the &s;moke cleared up I di&s;covered a ca&s;t of the Belvidere Apollo on a pede&s;tal in a niche at the upper end of the room; but, if we were to judge by the climate, this cham|ber mu&s;t have derived its name from Apollo, by the rule of <HI>lucus a non lucendo:</HI> As &s;oon as we were &s;eated, and Lady Thimble had in &s;ome degree compo&s;ed her &s;pirits, &s;he began to tell me, that the treat &s;he had to give me was the rehear&s;al of part of an epic poem, writ|ten by a young lady of &s;eventeen, who was a miracle of genius, and who&s;e talents for com|po&s;ition were &s;o extraordinary, that &s;he had written a treati&s;e on female education, whil&s;t &s;he was at the boarding-&s;chool, which all the world allowed to be a wonderful work for one of &s;uch an early age. There was no e&s;cape, for Calliope her&s;elf now entered the room, and dinner was put back a full hour for the luxury of hearing a canto of a boarding-&s;chool girl's epic poem read by her&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of Apollo. The Scotti&s;h philo&s;opher had pru|dently kept his po&s;t by the parlour fire, and I alone was &s;ingled out as the victim; Sir Theodore and his father-in-law being con&s;i|dered
<PB N="40" REF="46">
only as expletives to fill up the audi|ence. Calliope was enthroned in a chair at the pede&s;tal of Apollo, whil&s;t Lady Thimble and I took our &s;eats oppo&s;ite to the reader.</P>
<P>I was now to undergo an explanation of the &s;ubject matter of this poem; this was un|dertaken and performed by Lady Thimble, whil&s;t the young poete&s;s was adju&s;ting her manu&s;cript: The &s;ubject was allegorical; the title was <HI>The Triumph of Rea&s;on,</HI> who was the hero of the piece; the inferior characters were the human pa&s;&s;ions per&s;onified; each pa&s;&s;ion occupied a canto, and the lady had already di&s;patched a long li&s;t; if I rightly remember we were to hear the fourteenth canto; in thir|teen actions the hero Rea&s;on had been victo|rious, but it was exceedingly doubtful how he would come off in this, for the antagoni&s;t he had to deal with was no le&s;s a per&s;onage than almighty <HI>Love</HI> him&s;elf: The metre was heroic, and many of the thoughts di&s;played a juvenile fancy and wild originality; the action was not altogether unintere&s;ting, nor ill-managed, and victory for a while was held in &s;u&s;pence by a wound the hero received from an arrow &s;ome|where in the region of the heart; for this wound he could obtain no cure, till an ancient
<PB N="41" REF="47">
phy&s;ician, after many experiments for his relief, cut out the part affected with his <HI>&s;cythe:</HI> Upon the whole the poem was &s;uch, that had it not been allegorical, and had not I been cold and hungry, I could have found much to com|mend and &s;ome things to admire, even tho' the poete&s;s had been twice as old and not half &s;o hand&s;ome, for Calliope was extremely pret|ty, and I could plainly di&s;cover that nature meant her to be mo&s;t amiable and mode&s;t, if flattery and fal&s;e education would have &s;uffer|ed her good de&s;igns to have taken place; I therefore looked upon her with pity, as I do on all &s;poilt children; and when her reading was concluded, did not be&s;tow all that prai&s;e, which, if I had con&s;ulted my own gratification more than her good, I certainly &s;hould have be&s;towed; the only occa&s;ion, on which I think it a point of con&s;cience to practi&s;e the philo|&s;ophy of <HI>the Dampers.</HI></P>
<P>At length dinner was announced, and being a part of Lady Thimble's dome&s;tic oeconomy, which &s;he had put out of her own hands, as &s;he informed us, and in which I &s;u&s;pect the athletic philo&s;opher had &s;omething to &s;ay, it was plentifully &s;erved. Sir Theodore and my friend the merchant plied him pretty bri&s;kly
<PB N="42" REF="48">
with the bottle; but as a &s;tately fir&s;t-rate &s;hip does not conde&s;cend to open her ports to the petty crui&s;ers that pre&s;ume to hail her, in like manner this gigantic genius kept the oracle within him muzzled, nor conde&s;cended once to draw the tompion of his lips, till it happen|ed in the cour&s;e of many topics, that Lady Thimble, &s;peaking of the talents of Calliope, ob&s;erved that <HI>miracles</HI> were not cea&s;ed: <HI>How &s;hould that thing be &s;aid to cea&s;e,</HI> replied the oracle, <HI>which never had exi&s;tence?</HI> The &s;pring was now touched, that put this va&s;t machine in motion, and, taking infidelity in miracles for his text, he carried us, in the cour&s;e of a long uninterrupted harangue, through a &s;eries of learned deductions, to what appeared his grand de&s;ideratum, <HI>viz. an ab&s;olute refutation of the miracles of Chri&s;t by proofs logical and hi&s;torical.</HI> Whil&s;t this di&s;cour&s;e was going on, I was curious to ob&s;erve the different effects it had on the company: Lady Thimble received it with evident marks of triumph, &s;o that I could plainly &s;ee all was go&s;pel with her, and the only go&s;pel &s;he had faith in: Sir Theodore wi&s;ely fell a&s;leep; the merchant was in his compting-hou&s;e,&mdash;
<Q><PB N="43" REF="49">
<L>His mind was to&s;&s;ing on the ocean:</L>
<L>There, where his argo&s;ies with portly &s;ail,</L>
<L>Like Seigniors and rich Burghers on the flood,</L>
<L>Or as it were the pageants of the &s;ea,</L>
<L>Did overpeer the petty traffickers&mdash;</L></Q>
But all this while the young un&s;ettled thoughts of Calliope were vi&s;ibly wavering, &s;ometimes borne away by the <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> of the philo&s;opher and the echo of Lady Thimble's plaudits; &s;ometimes catching hold of Hope, and hang|ing to the anchor of her &s;alvation, Faith; at other times without re&s;i&s;tance carried down the tide of declamation, which rolled rapidly along in provincial dialect, like a torrent from his native Highland craggs, rough and noi&s;y; I &s;aw her &s;truggles with infinite concern; the &s;avage &s;aw them al&s;o, but with triumph, and, turning his di&s;cour&s;e upon the breach he had made in her belief, pre&s;&s;ed the advantage he had gained with devili&s;h addre&s;s; in &s;hort a new antagoni&s;t had &s;tarted up, more formi|dable to <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> than all the fourteen, from who&s;e attack &s;he had brought her hero off with victory; and that champion, which had re&s;i&s;ted the arrows of all-powerful <HI>Love,</HI> was likely now to fall a victim to the pe&s;tilential breath of <HI>Infidelity.</HI> In this dilemma I was
<PB N="44" REF="50">
doubtful how to act; I did not decline the combat becau&s;e I dreaded the &s;trength of this Goliah of the Phili&s;tines, for I knew the wea|pons might be confided in, which the great captain of &s;alvation had put into my hands; but I di&s;dained to plead before a prejudiced tribunal, in which the mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion &s;at as judge; and as &s;leep had &s;ecured one of the company out of harm's way, and another was upon an excur&s;ion from which I did not wi&s;h to bring him home, there remained only Calliope, and I determined within my&s;elf to take occa&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;ing with her apart, before I le&s;t the hou&s;e next morning.</P>

<HEAD>N^o VI.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD re&s;olved to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with Calliope after the athletic philo&s;o|pher's harangue again&s;t the evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion: I was at the pains of put|ting my thoughts together in writing before I went to bed, for I judged it be&s;t to give them to Calliope in &s;uch a form, as &s;he might here|after at any time refer to and examine.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">I had the &s;atisfaction of an hour's conver|&s;ation with that young lady next morning, before the family had a&s;&s;embled for breakfa&s;t: I could ob&s;erve that &s;omething dwelt upon her mind, and demanding of her if I was not right in my conjecture, &s;he an&s;wered me at once to the point without he&s;itation&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s to you,"</Q>
&s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"that the di&s;cour&s;e which Dr. Mac-Infidel ye&s;terday held, has made me thoroughly unhappy; things, which are above rea&s;on, I can readily &s;uppo&s;e are my&s;te|ries, which I ought to admit as matter of faith in religion; but things contrary to rea|&s;on, and facts which hi&s;tory confutes how am I to believe? What am I to do in this ca&s;e? Have you any thing to oppo&s;e to his argu|ment? If you have, I &s;hould be happy to hear it; if you have not, I pray you let us talk no more upon the &s;ubject."</Q>&mdash;I then gave the paper into her hand, which I had pre|pared, and explaining to her the rea&s;ons I had for not taking up the di&s;pute before our com|pany ye&s;terday, de&s;ired her to give my paper a &s;erious reading; if there was any thing in it, that laid out of the cour&s;e of her &s;tudies, I would gladly do my be&s;t to expound it, and would &s;hew her the authorities to which it

referred: She received my paper with the be&s;t grace in the world, and promi&s;ed me that &s;he would con&s;ider it with all the attention &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>In our further di&s;cour&s;e it chanced, that I let drop &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in commendation of her under&s;tanding and talents, upon which I ob&s;erved &s;he gave me a very expre&s;&s;ive look, and when I would have &s;poken of her poem, &s;he &s;hook her head, and, ha&s;tily interrupting me, de&s;ired I would &s;pare her on that &s;ubject; &s;he did not wi&s;h to be any more flattered in a folly &s;he had too much cau&s;e to repent of; &s;he had burnt the odious poem I was &s;peaking of, and, bur&s;ting &s;uddenly into a flood of tears, prote&s;ted &s;he would never be guilty of writing another line of poetry, while &s;he lived.</P>
<P>No words of mine can paint the look and action, which accompanied the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; much le&s;s can I de&s;cribe the &s;troke of pity and &s;urprize, which her emotion gave me. It was evident &s;he alluded to &s;omething that had oc|curred &s;ince the reading of the poem; I re|collected &s;he was ab&s;ent all the latter part of the evening, and I felt an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to enquire into the cau&s;e of her affliction, tho' the &s;hortne&s;s of our acquaintance gave me no

&s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"but that fatal argu|ment I heard la&s;t night has &s;o weakened the re&s;ource, to which my mind in all afflictions would el&s;e have naturally applied, that I re|ally know not how to &s;upport my&s;elf, nor where to look for comfort, but by throwing my&s;elf upon your friend&s;hip for advice, as the mo&s;t unhappy of all beings.

<P>Though there cannot be in this world a ta&s;k &s;o painful to me, as what I am now about to perform, yet I think it an indi&s;|pen&s;ible point of honour to inform my late mo&s;t lovely and beloved Nancy, that if I am to &s;uppo&s;e her the author of that enormous bundle of ver&s;es I have received from her hand, it is the la&s;t favour that hand mu&s;t be&s;tow upon her unhappy Henry.</P>
<P>My education you know; for it was formed under your mo&s;t excellent father; I &s;erved with him from a child, and he taught me, not indeed the knack of making ver&s;es, but what I hope has been as u&s;eful to my country, the duties of an officer. Being his daughter, I had flattered my&s;elf you would not like me the le&s;s for following his profe&s;&s;ion, or for being trained to it under his in&s;truction. But alas! Nancy, all the&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="58">
hopes are gone. My ignorance would only di&s;grace you, and your wit would make me contemptible; &s;ince you are turned poete&s;s, how can my &s;ociety be agreeable? If tho&s;e ver&s;es you have &s;ent me are all of your own making, you mu&s;t have done little el&s;e &s;ince we parted, and if &s;uch are to be your &s;tudies and occupations, what is to become of all the comforts of a hu&s;band? How are you to fulfil the duties of a mother, or manage the concerns of a family? No, no; may heaven defend me from a learned wife! I am too proud to be the butt of my own table; too accu&s;tomed to command, to be ea&s;ily induced to obey; let me ever live a &s;ingle man, or let the wife I chu&s;e be mo|de&s;t, unpretending, &s;imple, natural in her manners, plain in her under&s;tanding; let her be true as the compa&s;s I &s;ail by, and (pardon the coar&s;ene&s;s of the allu&s;ion) obe|dient to the helm as the &s;hip I &s;teer; then, Nancy, I will &s;tand by my wife, as I will by my &s;hip, to the late&s;t moment I have to breathe. For God's &s;ake what have wo|men to do with learning? But if they will &s;tep out of their own profe&s;&s;ion and write
<PB N="53" REF="59">
ver&s;es, do not let them &s;tep into ours to chu&s;e hu&s;bands; we &s;hall prove coar&s;e me&s;&s;|mates to the mu&s;es.</P>

<P>I WAS agreeably &s;urprized the other day with an unexpected vi&s;it from a country friend, who once made a con&s;iderable figure in the fa&s;hionable world, and, with an elegant ta&s;te for the fine arts, is po&s;&s;e&s;t of many valu|able paintings and &s;culptures of his own col|lecting in Italy: He told me, that after &s;ix years ab&s;ence from town, he had made a jour|ney purpo&s;ely to regale his curio&s;ity for a few days with the &s;pectacles of this great capital, and de&s;ired I would accompany him on his morning's tour to &s;ome of the eminent arti&s;ts, and afterwards conduct him to the theatre, where he had &s;ecured him&s;elf a &s;eat for the re|pre&s;entation of Mr. Southern's tragedy of the

<HI>Fatal Marriage.</HI> Though I had ju&s;t been honoured with a card from Vane&s;&s;a, purport|ing that &s;he &s;hould hold <HI>The Fea&s;t of Rea&s;on</HI> that evening at her hou&s;e, where my company was expected, I did not he&s;itate to accept the invitation of my country friend, and excu&s;e my&s;elf from that of Vane&s;&s;a, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s my curio&s;ity was &s;omewhat rou&s;ed by the novelty of the entertainment to which I was bidden. Our day pa&s;&s;ed &s;o entirely to the &s;atisfaction of my candid companion, that, when we parted at night, he &s;hook me by the hand, and with a &s;mile of complacency de|clared, that a day &s;o &s;pent would not di&s;grace the diary of Pericles.</P>
<P>When I had returned to my apartment, this allu&s;ion of my friend to the age of Peri|cles, with the recollection of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the day, threw me into a reverie, in the cour&s;e of which I fell a&s;leep, whil&s;t my mind with more di&s;tinctne&s;s than is u&s;ual in dream|ing, pur&s;ued its waking train of thought after the following manner.</P>
<P>"I found my&s;elf in a &s;tately portico, which being on an eminence, gave me the pro&s;pect of a city, inclo&s;ing a prodigious circuit, with groves, gardens, and fields, &s;eemingly &s;et apart
<PB N="56" REF="62">
for martial exerci&s;es and &s;ports; the hou&s;es were not clu&s;tered into &s;treets and alleys like our great trading towns, but were placed apart and &s;eparated without any regular order, as if each man had therein con&s;ulted his own particular ta&s;te and enjoyments. I thought I never &s;aw &s;o delightful a place, nor a people who lived &s;o much at their ea&s;e: I felt a fre&s;hne&s;s and &s;alubrity in the climate, that &s;eemed to clear the brain, and give a &s;pring to the &s;pirits and whole animal frame: The &s;un was bright and glowing, but the lightne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere and a refre&s;hing breeze qualified the heat in the mo&s;t delicious man|ner. As I looked about me with wonder and delight, I ob&s;erved a great many edifices of the pure&s;t architecture, that &s;eemed calculated for public purpo&s;es; and wherever my eye went, it was encountered by a variety of &s;ta|tues in bra&s;s or marble; immediately at the foot of the &s;teps, leading to the portico, in which I &s;tood, I ob&s;erved a figure in bra&s;s of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, which by its attributes I believed de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the heathen deity Mercurius. In the centre of the city there was an edifice inclo&s;ed within walls, which I took to be the citadel; a rapid &s;tream
<PB N="57" REF="63">
of clear water meandered about the place, and was trained through groves and gardens in the mo&s;t picture&s;que and plea&s;ing manner, while the pro&s;pect at di&s;tance was bounded by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>"As I &s;tood wrapt in contemplation of this new and brilliant &s;cenery, methought I was acco&s;ted by a middle-aged man in a loo&s;e garment of fine purple, who wore his hair after the manner of our ladies, braided and coiled round upon the crown of his head with great care and delicacy to a con&s;iderable heighth; and (which I thought remarkable) he had fa&s;tened the braids in &s;everal places with golden pins, on which were &s;everal figures of &s;mall gra&s;hoppers of the &s;ame metal; be|hind him walked a &s;ervant-youth, or &s;lave, carrying a light wicker chair for his ma&s;ter to repo&s;e in, a cu&s;tom that &s;eemed to me to argue great effeminacy; and looking about me I found it was pretty univer&s;al, many of the bettermo&s;t &s;ort of citizens being &s;eated in the &s;treets, conver&s;ing at their ea&s;e, though there was certainly nothing in the climate, that made &s;uch an indulgence nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"As I was eyeing this gentleman with a &s;ur|prize, that I mu&s;t own had &s;ome &s;mall tincture
<PB N="58" REF="64">
of contempt in it, he turned him&s;elf to me, and in the mo&s;t complai&s;ant manner imagin|able acco&s;ted me in my own language, telling me, he perceived I was a &s;tranger in Athens, and if I was curious to &s;ee what was remark|able in the place, he was ready to dedicate the day to my &s;ervice. To this courteous addre&s;s I returned the be&s;t an&s;wer I was able, adding that every thing was new to me and many things appeared admirable. You will &s;ay &s;o, replied he, before the day is pa&s;t, and yet I cannot &s;hew you in the &s;pace of a day the hundredth part of what this city contains worth a &s;tranger's ob&s;ervation: Of a certain Arts and Sciences are now carried to their utmo&s;t pitch, and no future age I think will &s;ucceed, in which the glory of the Athenian commonwealth, and the genius of its citizens &s;hall be found &s;uperior to their pre&s;ent lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>"The portico, in which you &s;tand, conti|nued the Athenian, is what we call <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">cile,</HI> or the <HI>painted Portico</HI>; the brazen &s;tatue at the foot of the &s;teps was rai&s;ed by the nine Archons in honour of <HI>Mercurius Agoraeus,</HI> or the <HI>Foren&s;al</HI>; and dedicated by them to the tribes: That by its &s;ide is the &s;tatue of Solon, the other at &s;ome di&s;tance is the lawgiver

Lycurgus. The gate before you, on which you &s;ee tho&s;e warlike trophies, was &s;o adorned in memory of the defeat of Pli&s;tarchus, who was brother of the famous Ca&s;&s;ander, and commanded his cavalry and auxiliary troops in the action recorded. The&s;e paintings be|hind you, with which the portico is furni&s;hed and from which it has its name, are all upon public &s;ubjects in commemoration of wi&s;e or valiant citizens: The pictures on your right hand are by the celebrated Polygnotus, the&s;e on your left by Micon, equal to his rival in art, but not in munificence; for Polygnotus would accept no other reward for his works, than the fame in&s;eparable from &s;uch eminent performances; Micon on the contrary was paid by the &s;tate. There are &s;everal others by the hands of our great ma&s;ters, particular|ly that incomparable piece, which repre&s;ents the field of Marathon, a compo&s;ition by the great Panaenus, brother of the &s;tatuary Phi|dias; but this, as well as the others, will de|mand a more particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"Examine this compo&s;ition on your right; it is the work of Polygnotus; you &s;ee two armies drawn up front to front and on the point of engaging; the&s;e are the Athenians,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
the adver&s;e troops are the Lacedemonians; the &s;cene is Oenoe; &s;uch is the contrivance of the arti&s;t, that you are &s;ure victory is to declare for the Athenians, though the battle is not yet commenced.</P>
<P>"In the oppo&s;ite piece you &s;ee the battle of The&s;eus with the Amazons; a capital com|po&s;ition by Micon; the&s;e warlike ladies are fighting on hor&s;eback; with what wonderful art has the ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed the character of athletic beauty without deviating into vulga|rity and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s! If you recollect the Ly&s;i|&s;trata of Ari&s;tophanes you will meet an elogi|um on this picture; it is thus the &s;i&s;ter arts encourage and &s;upport each other.</P>
<P>"Now turn to Polygnotus's &s;ide and look at that magnificent piece of art: The painter has cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of his compo&s;ition the council of the Grecian chiefs upon the violence done to Ca&s;&s;andra by Ajax after the capture of Troy; you &s;ee the brutal character of the man &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in the hero of the piece; among&s;t that group of Trojan cap|tives Ca&s;&s;andra is con&s;picuous; that figure, which repre&s;ents Laodice, is worth your no|tice, as being a portrait of Elpinice a cele|brated courte&s;an: Scrupulous people have ta|ken
<PB N="61" REF="67">
offence at it, but great painters will in|dulge them&s;elves in the&s;e liberties, and are fond of painting after beautiful nature; of which I could give you innumerable exam|ples.</P>
<P>"Now let us in the la&s;t place regale our eyes with this ine&s;timable battle of Marathon by Panaenus: What think you of it? Was it not a reward worthy of the heroes, who pre|&s;erved their country on that glorious day? Which party is mo&s;t honoured by the work, the ma&s;ter who wrought it, or the valiant per|&s;onages who are recorded by it? It is a que&s;|tion difficult to decide. You will ob&s;erve three different groups in this &s;uperb com|po&s;ition, de&s;cribing three different periods of the action: Here you &s;ee the Athenians and their allies the Plataeans ju&s;t commencing the action.&mdash;There, further removed in per&s;pec|tive, the barbarians are defeated; the &s;laughter is raging, and the Medes are plunging de&s;pe|rately into the mar&s;hy lake to avoid their pur|&s;uers; examine the back ground, and you &s;ee the Phoenician gallies; the barbarians are making a bold attack, and the &s;ea is covered with wrecks: All mouths are open in applau&s;e of this picture, and it was but the other day,
<PB N="62" REF="68">
that the great orator Demo&s;thenes referred to it in a &s;olemn harangue upon Neaera, as did E&s;chines in his pleading again&s;t Cte&s;iphon. All our Captains are taken from the life; that General who is encouraging his troops is Miltiades; he is the hero of the piece, and I can a&s;&s;ure you the re&s;emblance is in all points exact: This is the portrait of Callimachus the Polemarck: There you &s;ee the hero Echetlus, and this is the brave Epizelus; that Athenian, who is valiantly fighting, is Cynaegirus him&s;elf, who lo&s;t both his hands in the action; there goes an extraordinary &s;tory with that dog, which is by his &s;ide, and has &s;eized the dying barbarian by the throat; the faithful creature would not for&s;ake his ma&s;ter; he was killed in the action, and is now de|&s;ervedly immortalized in company with the illu&s;trious heroes, who are the &s;ubject of the piece. Tho&s;e &s;plendid warriors in the army of the Medes, who are &s;tanding in their cha|riots, and calling to their troops, are the ge|nerals Datis and Artaphanes. They are drawn in a proud and &s;welling &s;tile, and &s;eem of a larger &s;ize and proportion than our Athenian champions; and the fact is, that this group was in&s;erted by another ma&s;ter; they are by
<PB N="63" REF="69">
the hand of Micon, and perhaps do not exact|ly harmonize with the re&s;t; the &s;illy Atheni|ans were piqued at their appearance, and in a fit of jealou&s;y puni&s;hed Micon by a fine for having painted them too flatteringly; the painter &s;uffered in his pocket, but the people in my opinion were di&s;graced by the &s;entence: This circum&s;tance has given occa&s;ion for ma|ny on the part of Micon to conte&s;t the honour of the painting with Panaenus, who in ju&s;tice mu&s;t be con&s;idered as principal author of the work; and in cour&s;e of time it may happen, that po&s;terity will be puzzled which ma&s;ter to a&s;cribe it to.</P>
<P>"There are many more pictures well de|&s;erving your attentive notice, particularly that by Pamphilus, which repre&s;ents Alomena with the Heraclidae a&s;king aid of the Athenians again&s;t Eury&s;theus; and this in&s;pired old figure by Polygnotus with a lyre in his hand, which is the portrait of no le&s;s a per&s;on than the great Sophocles;&mdash;but come, let us be gone, for we have much be&s;ides to &s;ee; and I per|ceive Zeno coming this way with his &s;cholars to hold his lectures in this portico; and I for one mu&s;t confe&s;s I am no friend to the Stoics, or as we call them the Zenonians.</P>

<P>"FROM the painted portico, in which my la&s;t was dated, my Athenian con|ductor took me to the Ptolemaic Gymna&s;ium, in which I ob&s;erved &s;everal &s;tatues of Mercury in marble, and others of bra&s;s, which he ex|plained to me to be of Ptolemy the founder, Juba and Chry&s;ippus the philo&s;opher. There was one of Bero&s;us the a&s;trologer with a tongue of pure gold, in commemoration of his divine predictions: On one hand of me &s;tood the doric temple of The&s;eus, enriched with &s;ome ine&s;timable paintings of Micon, particularly one upon the &s;ubject of the fight of the Lapithae and Centaurs: on the other hand was the antient temple of the Dio&s;curi, in which I was &s;hewn many capital pictures by Polygnotus; it is here, &s;ays my conductor, we admini&s;ter to the Athenian youth that &s;olemn oath, which binds them not to de&s;ert their
<PB N="65" REF="71">
ranks in action, but to peri&s;h, when nece&s;&s;ity &s;o requires, in defence of their country; the form is rather long, &s;ays he, but this is the &s;ub&s;tance of the oath. The Prytaneum, or Court-hou&s;e, was now in view, where the magi&s;tracy of the city a&s;&s;emble for the di&s;patch of public bu&s;ine&s;s: Here I &s;aw the venerable laws of Solon in a che&s;t of &s;tone, the &s;tatues of Pax and Ve&s;ta, and (which were more intere&s;ting to me) the figures of Miltiades and Themi&s;tocles of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip in pure marble; in this place all tho&s;e citizens, and the po&s;terity of tho&s;e, who have de&s;erved well of the &s;tate, receive their public doles or allowance of bread in cakes com|po&s;ed of meal, oil, and water; here al&s;o I &s;aw the perpetual fire upon the altar of Ve&s;ta, and the celebrated image of the Bona Fortuna of the Athenians. In the adjoining temple of Lucina I was &s;hewn the famous &s;tatues of that deity clothed in drapery to the feet: My guide now carried me to the great temple of Olympian Ju|piter, founded by the tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus, and perfected by his &s;ons and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; I ob&s;erved to my conductor, that I had &s;een no temple in Athens, except this, with interior columns; he informed me that the great &s;pan of the roof made it nece&s;&s;ary in this in&s;tance, but that it was contrary to their rule of architecture and
<PB N="66" REF="72">
obtained in no other: He further told me that the city had expended ten thou&s;and talents in this edifice: The image of the god was cut in ivory and gold; to every column was affixed a brazen &s;tatue, repre&s;enting the colonial cities of the Athenian empire. The di&s;play of &s;tatuary exceeded all de&s;cription or belief, nor was the painter's art wanting in its &s;hare of the decora|tion; for wherever pictures could be di&s;po&s;ed, and particularly about the pede&s;tal of the &s;tatue of Jupiter, the mo&s;t capital paintings were to be &s;een.</P>
<P>"My &s;ight was now &s;o dazzled with the di&s;|play of brilliant images, and my mind &s;o over|powered with the miracles of art, which had pa&s;&s;ed in review, that I be&s;eeched my guide to carry me either to &s;ome of tho&s;e groves, which were in my eye, where I could meditate on what I had &s;een, or to &s;pectacles of any other &s;ort ac|cording to his choice and di&s;cretion, for other|wi&s;e I &s;hould apprehend, from the variety of objects, I &s;hould retain the memory of none. He told me in reply, that this was his intention, ob&s;erving that the proportion I had &s;een was very &s;mall indeed to what the city contained; there was however one more &s;tatue, which he could not di&s;pen&s;e with him&s;elf from &s;hewing me, being a model of beauty and perfection; and
<PB N="67" REF="73">
having &s;o &s;aid methought he took me into a neighbouring garden, and in a grove of cypre&s;s and myrtle pre&s;ented to my view the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite piece of &s;culpture I had ever beheld.&mdash;This, &s;ays he, is the Venus called Cele&s;tial, the workman&s;hip of the immortal Alcamen.&mdash;After I had contemplated this divine original with a&s;toni&s;hment and rapture, I was &s;atisfied within my&s;elf, that we are mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing it has de&s;cended to us, and I now acknowledge that our cele&s;tial Venus is a copy far inferior to its inimitable prototype. Having examined this &s;ta|tue for &s;ome time, I turned to my conductor and &s;aid:&mdash;Let us gratify our &s;en&s;es in &s;ome other way; I have &s;een enough of art.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it, replies he, in this city, and &s;o &s;aying led me into the Lyceum; this Gymna&s;ium, &s;ays he, has been lately in|&s;tituted by Pericles, and the&s;e plantations of plane-trees are of his making; &s;o are the&s;e aqueducts; the Lyceum was originally dedica|ted to Pa&s;toral Apollo, and owes its foundation and beauty in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the elegant Pi&s;i&s;tratus, who from the &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;emblance of their per&s;ons we now call the elder Pericles. The place is delightful, and before you leave it take notice of this &s;tatue of Apollo; the arti&s;t has de&s;cribed him in the attitude of re&s;ting after
<PB N="68" REF="74">
his daily cour&s;e; you &s;ee he leans again&s;t a co|lumn; his right arm bent over his head, and in his left he holds his bow; it is a fir&s;t-rate piece of &s;culpture. Leaving the Lyceum my con|ductor took me by the way of the Tripods; here he &s;hewed me the inimitable &s;atyr in bra&s;s, the boa&s;ted ma&s;ter-piece of Praxiteles, and the Cupid and Bacchus of Thymilus; we were now clo&s;e by the theatre, in the portico of which I was &s;hewn the &s;tatue of E&s;chylus, and two pe|de&s;tals for the &s;tatues of Sophocles and Euripides, then under the arti&s;ts hands, although both tho&s;e poets were now living: The doors of the theatre were not yet opened, and the temple of Venus being near at hand, methought we entered, and I beheld the beautiful Cupid crowned with ro&s;es, painted by Zeuxis; from hence I could &s;ee the works, that Pericles had been carrying on upon the citadel, but this we did not enter.</P>
<P>"Methought I was now carried into the thea|tre amid&s;t a prodigious crowd of people; the comedy of the night was intitled <HI>The Clouds,</HI> and the famous Ari&s;tophanes was announced to be the author of it. It was expected that Socrates would be per&s;onally attacked, and a great party of that philo&s;opher's enemies were a&s;&s;embled to &s;upport the poet. I was much &s;urprized, when my companion pointed out to me that great phi|lo&s;opher
<PB N="69" REF="75">
in per&s;on, who had actually taken his &s;eat in the theatre, and was &s;itting between Al|cibiades and Antipho the &s;on of Pericles; by the &s;ide of Alcibiades &s;ate Euripides, and at Anti|pho's left hand &s;ate Thucydides; I never beheld two more venerable old men than the poet and hi&s;torian, nor &s;uch comely per&s;ons as Alcibiades and Antipho: Socrates was exceedingly like the bu&s;ts we have of him, his head was bald, his beard bu&s;hy, and his &s;tature low; there was &s;omething very deterring in his countenance; his per&s;on was mean and his habit &s;qualid; his ve&s;t was of loo&s;e drapery, thrown over his left &s;houlder after the fa&s;hion of a Spani&s;h Capa, and &s;eemed to be of coar&s;e cloth, made of black wool undyed; he had a &s;hort &s;taff in his hand of knotted wood with a round head, which he was continually rubbing in the palm of his hand, as he talked with Alcibiades, to whom he princi|pally addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e: Thucydides had lately returned from exile upon a general am|ne&s;ty, and I ob&s;erved a melancholy in his coun|tenance mixed with indignation; Euripides &s;eem|ed employed in examining the countenances of the &s;pectators, whil&s;t Antipho with great mode&s;ty paid a mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention to the venerable philo&s;opher on his right hand. Whil&s;t I was engaged in ob&s;erving this re&s;pectable group, my
<PB N="70" REF="76">
conductor whi&s;pered the following words in my ear&mdash;<HI>This is the &s;econd attack from the &s;ame hand upon Socrates; that of la&s;t year was defeated by Alcibiades; but if this night's comedy &s;ucceeds, I predict that our philo&s;opher is undone: and in truth his &s;chool is much out of credit; for &s;ome of the wor&s;t characters of the age have come out of his hands of late.</HI></P>
<P>"When the players fir&s;t came on the &s;tage there was &s;o great a murmur in the theatre, that I could &s;carce hear them; after a &s;hort time however the &s;ilence became pretty general, and the plot of the play, &s;uch as it was, began to open; I perceived that the poet had devi&s;ed the character of an old clowni&s;h father, who be|ing plunged in debt by the extravagancies of a flanting wife and a &s;pendthrift &s;on, who wa&s;ted his fortune upon race-hor&s;es, was for ever puz|zling his brains to &s;trike upon &s;ome expedient for cheating his creditors. With this view he goes to the hou&s;e of Socrates to take coun&s;el of that philo&s;opher, who gives him a great many ridiculous in&s;tructions, &s;eemingly not at all to the purpo&s;e, and among&s;t other extravagancies a&s;&s;ures him that Jupiter has no concern in the government of the world, but that all the func|tions of providence are performed by <HI>The Clouds,</HI> which upon his invocation appear and perform
<PB N="71" REF="77">
the part of a chorus throughout the play: The philo&s;opher is continually foiled by the ru&s;tic wit of the old father, who, after being put in Socra|tes's truckle bed and mi&s;erably &s;tung with ver|min, has a meeting with his creditors, and en|deavours to parry their demands with a parcel of pedantic quibbles, which he has learnt of the philo&s;opher, and which give occa&s;ion to &s;cenes of admirable comic humour: My conductor in|formed me this incident was pointed at E&s;chines, a favorite di&s;ciple of Socrates; a man, &s;ays he, plunged in debts and a mo&s;t notorious defrauder of his creditors. In the end the father brings his &s;on to be in&s;tructed by Socrates; the &s;on, after a &s;hort lecture, comes forth a perfect Athe|i&s;t, and gives his father a &s;evere cudgelling on the &s;tage, which irreverend act he undertakes to defend upon the principles of the new philo&s;ophy, he had been learning. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the play, in the cour&s;e of which there were many gro&s;s allu&s;ions to the unnatural vice, of which Socrates was accu&s;ed, and many per&s;onal &s;trokes again&s;t Cli&s;thenes, Pericles, Euripides, and others, which told &s;trongly, and were much applauded by the theatre.</P>

party in the theatre, which carried it through, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ence of Socrates and the re&s;pectable junto that attended him: For my part I &s;carce ever took my eyes from him during the repre&s;entation, and I ob&s;erved two or three little actions, which &s;eemed to give me &s;ome in|&s;ight into the temper of his mind during the &s;e|vere&s;t libel, that was ever exhibited again&s;t any man's per&s;on and principles.</P>
<P>"Before Socrates appears on the &s;tage, the old man raps violently at his door, and is reproved by one of his di&s;ciples, who comes out and com|plains of the di&s;turbance; upon his being que&s;|tioned what the philo&s;opher may be then em|ployed upon, he an&s;wers that he is engaged in mea&s;uring the leap of a flea, to decide how many of its own lengths it &s;prings at one hop; the di&s;|ciple al&s;o informs him with great &s;olemnity, that Socrates has di&s;covered that the hum of a gnat is not made by the mouth of the animal, but from behind: This rai&s;ed a laugh at the ex|pence of the naturali&s;ts and minute philo&s;ophers, and I ob&s;erved that Socrates him&s;elf &s;miled at the conceit.</P>

though the poet pretends to account for it, as if they were &s;earching for natural curio&s;ities on the &s;urface of the ground, the action was evidently intended to convey the gro&s;&s;e&s;t allu&s;ion, and was &s;o received by the audience: When this &s;cene was produced I remarked, that Socrates &s;hook his head, and turned his eyes off the &s;tage; whil&s;t Euripides with &s;ome indignation threw the &s;leeve of his mantle over his face; this was ob&s;erved by the &s;pectators, and produced a con|&s;iderable tumult, in which the theatre &s;eemed pretty fairly divided, &s;o that the actors &s;tood up|right, and quitted the po&s;ture they were di&s;co|vered in.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER you left me at Lady Thimble's, I &s;eized the fir&s;t moment, that the angui&s;h of my mind permitted me to make u&s;e of, to put my&s;elf in readine&s;s for taking my final leave of that family, and, according to the plan we had concerted, came without delay to this place, where, if any thing could have given ab&s;olute peace to my mind, the con&s;olation of the&s;e ex|cellent people, and the &s;erenity of the &s;cene mu&s;t have done it. As it was, I felt my af|flictions lighten, my &s;elf-reproach became le&s;s bitter, and, whil&s;t the vanity, which flattery had in&s;pired me with, has been cured by their admonitions, the doubts that infidelity had rai&s;|ed have been totally removed, and truth made clear to my eternal comfort and conviction. Had it not been for this, I &s;hould have been given up to de&s;pair; for as I heard no more
<PB N="76" REF="82">
from Captain Con&s;tant, I was convinced he had renounced me for ever; in the mean time I wrote many letters, but &s;ent none to him; &s;ome of the&s;e letters were written in a high tone, mo&s;t of them in an humble one, and in one I gave a loo&s;e to pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair in ex|pre&s;&s;ions little &s;hort of phren&s;y; all the&s;e I con&s;tantly de&s;troyed, for as I had not the heart to write angrily to him, &s;o I dreaded to appear mean in his eyes, if I was too plaintive; nay I was not &s;ure, &s;ince his fortune had become &s;o &s;uperior to mine, but I might lay my&s;elf open to a charge of the mo&s;t de&s;picable nature.</P>

He then quitted me altogether, and throwing him&s;elf on his knees at my feet, en|treated me to forgive him, if he had offended me; he had been di&s;tracted between joy and terror, and &s;carce knew what he had done; he proceeded to account for the motives of his conduct towards me, both when he wrote the letter to me from Plymouth, and for every moment of his time &s;ince: That he had &s;et off for London the very day he wrote, had &s;ought you out, and conver&s;ed fully with you upon the effects his letter had produced; that, hearing I was come to this place, he would have followed me with an immediate explana|tion, if you had not prevailed with him to the contrary (for which advice I cannot now find in my heart to condemn you), that however he had placed him&s;elf within two miles of me

<P>UPON revi&s;ing what I wrote for Cal|liope in an&s;wer to Dr. Mac-Infidel's di&s;|cour&s;e again&s;t Chri&s;t's miracles, I find the argu|ment &s;o connected with certain pa&s;&s;ages in the life of the great heathen philo&s;opher Pytha|goras, which the adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity have &s;et up again&s;t the &s;criptural records of the Me&s;|&s;ias, that I have been tempted to enlarge upon what I gave to that young lady by prefacing it with an account of what I find curious in the relations of the &s;ophi&s;ts and biographers touching that extraordinary man.</P>
<P>The variety of fictions, which the writers, who treat of Pythagoras, have inter&s;per&s;ed in their accounts, makes it difficult to trace out any con&s;i&s;tent &s;tory of his life: His biographers agree &s;carcely in any one fact or date: Porphyry &s;ays he was born at Tyre; Jamblichus will have
<PB N="85" REF="91">
it to be at Sidon, probably as being the more ancient city; Jo&s;ephus &s;ays it is as hard to fix the place of his nativity, as Homer's, or to a&s;certain the year of his birth. Jamblichus, glancing at the go&s;pel account of the birth of Chri&s;t, &s;ays, that when the mother of Pythagoras was with child of him, her hu&s;band being igno|rant of her pregnancy, brought her to the oracle at Delphi, and there the prophete&s;s told him the fir&s;t news of his wife's having conceived, and al&s;o that the child, &s;he then went with, &s;hould prove the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to mankind; that her hu&s;band thereupon changed her name from Par|thenis to Pythais, and, when the child was born, named him Pythagoras, as being foretold by Apollo Pythius, for &s;o, &s;ays he, the name &s;igni|fies; and adds, that there can be no doubt, but that the &s;oul of the child was one of Apollo's companions in heaven, and came down by com|mi&s;&s;ion from him. When this and many other fables are ca&s;t out of the account it is mo&s;t pro|bable that Pythagoras was born at Samos in the 3d year of Olymp. XLVIII, 586 years before Chri&s;t, being the &s;on of Mne&s;archus, an engra|ver of &s;eals, which Mne&s;archus was de&s;cended from Hippa&s;us of Phlius, and his mother Pythais from Ancaeus, one of the planters of Samos.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92">Nature be&s;towed upon Pythagoras a form and per&s;on more than ordinarily comely; he gave early indications of a mind capable of great ex|ertions, and ambitious of excelling in know|ledge: The Greeks had now begun to open &s;chools for the public in&s;truction of youth; the rudiments of &s;cience were taught in the&s;e &s;emi|naries to a degree &s;ufficient for the common purpo&s;es of liberal education, but the la&s;t fini&s;h|ing for &s;uch as a&s;pired to be adepts in the &s;upe|rior learning of the times was only to be ob|tained among&s;t the Egyptian and Chaldean &s;ages; to them was the great re&s;ort of literary travellers; from their &s;ource Greece had derived her &s;y&s;tems of theology and natural philo&s;ophy. The Egyptians were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many an|cient traditions of Mo&s;aical origin, though di&s;|gui&s;ed by emblems and hieroglyphics, which Greece in adopting was never able to develope, and of which it is probable the Egyptians them&s;elves had lo&s;t the clue: The Greeks, ever &s;ince the time of Cecrops, had been progre&s;|&s;ively erecting a fabulous and idolatrous &s;y&s;tem of theology upon this foundation. The Egyp|tians in very early time under certain types and &s;ymbols had &s;hadowed out the attributes of the deity, the great events of the deluge and re|peopling of the earth, and the&s;e being received
<PB N="87" REF="93">
by the Greeks in a literal &s;en&s;e, generated in the end a multitudinous race of deities with a thou|&s;and chimerical rites and ceremonies, which al|together formed &s;o puzzling a compound of ab|&s;urdity, that no two thinking heathens agreed in the &s;ame creed: Still they went on accumulating error upon error; every philo&s;opher, who re|turned from Egypt, imported &s;ome addition to the &s;tock, till Olympus was crowded with divi|nities. If the heathens had ever defined their religion, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it upon &s;y&s;tem, they would have de&s;troyed it; but whil&s;t every man might think for him&s;elf, and every man, who thought at all, got rid of his difficulties by &s;up|po&s;ing there was &s;ome my&s;tery in the ca&s;e, which he either did not trouble him&s;elf to interpret, or interpreted as he &s;aw fit, the impo&s;ing fabric &s;tood, and, magnified through the mi&s;ts of error, appear|ed to have a dignity and &s;ub&s;tance, which upon examination and &s;crutiny would have vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>The parents of Pythagoras put him fir&s;t under the tuition of Pherecydes of Syrus: Pherecydes did not die till Olymp. LXVI, &s;o that Diogenes Laertius mu&s;t be flagrantly mi&s;taken in &s;aying that Pythagoras &s;tudied under this philo&s;opher till his death: He was very young when he went into Syria for this purpo&s;e, for he returned to Samos to his parents, and after &s;tudying &s;ome time
<PB N="88" REF="94">
under Hermodamas there, &s;et out upon his tra|vels into Egypt at the age of eighteen. At this early age he had acquired all the erudition the philo&s;ophers of Greece could give him; he had already vi&s;ited many cities of Syria, and performed his initiations: It is &s;aid he had con&s;ulted Thales in per&s;on, and been advi&s;ed by that &s;age to pro|&s;ecute his &s;tudies among&s;t the learned Egyptians; but this is doubtful; it is altogether improbable that he &s;hould depart from Samos at the age of eighteen upon the patriotic motive a&s;cribed to him by Laertius of avoiding the growing tyranny of his countryman Polycrates; e&s;pecially when the &s;ame biographer informs us, that he took letters of recommendation from Polycrates to King Ama&s;is, de&s;iring him to give order for Pythagoras's being in&s;tructed by the Egyptian prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>With this letter Pythagoras repaired to Ama&s;is, and obtained an order to the prie&s;ts, agreeable to the reque&s;t of Polycrates; with this he went fir&s;t to the prie&s;ts of Heliopolis; they declined the execution of it by referring him to their bre|thren at Memphis, as being their &s;eniors in the &s;acerdotal rank; the&s;e again evaded the order and di&s;patched him to the Dio&s;polites; he found the&s;e &s;ages as little di&s;po&s;ed to compliance as the prie&s;ts of Heliopolis or Memphis; however, as the king's
<PB N="89" REF="95">
command was urgent, they did not think fit ab|&s;olutely to di&s;obey it, but took a method, which they thought would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e and began by deterring and alarming the inqui&s;itive youth by their preparatory au&s;terities; but they had no common &s;pirit to deal with; Pythagoras had a con&s;titution, that could endure hard&s;hips, and an ambition that nothing could daunt; he &s;ubmitted to the ceremony of circumci&s;ion, and was initiated into their &s;acred rites, unintimidated by all the horrors, with which they contrived to &s;et them forth. They began then to regard him with more benignity and re&s;pect, and when they found him learning their language with &s;urpriz|ing rapidity, and conforming to their di&s;cipline with the mo&s;t rigid exactne&s;s, they looked upon him with &s;urprize and admiration; they now re|&s;olved to hold nothing back from talents &s;o extraordinary and temper &s;o conformable; he learnt their three &s;orts of letters; they admitted him to their &s;acrifices, and di&s;clo&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;e|cret rites of their religion, my&s;teries never be|fore imparted to any foreigner. He re&s;ided in Egypt a long time, during which he read the books of the ancient prie&s;ts, and in them he di&s;|covered the &s;ources of the Grecian theology, and how erroneous the &s;y&s;tem was, which they had derived from the&s;e &s;ources; he is &s;uppo&s;ed

<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved that Pythagoras on his re|turn from the Ea&s;t took the i&s;land of Crete in his way; here he vi&s;ited the famous philo|&s;opher Epimenides. Porphyry and Jamblichus
<PB N="93" REF="99">
mu&s;t be greatly out in their chronology when they make Epimenides one of Pythagoras's &s;cho|lars; Laertius's account is more probable, who &s;ays he was one of Pythagoras's ma&s;ters, which naturally accounts for that philo&s;opher's &s;eeking an interview with him in Crete, as he did after|wards with Pherecydes on his death-bed in Syria: In this interview Pythagoras no doubt gave an account to Epimenides of the many marvellous things he had learnt in his travels, and &s;o far the di&s;ciple may be &s;aid to have in&s;tructed his ma&s;ter; Epimenides him&s;elf was no &s;mall adept in the marvellous, and propagated a &s;tory thro' Greece of his having &s;lept fifty-&s;even years in a cave, and that upon waking after his long repo&s;e he re&s;umed his &s;earch for &s;ome &s;heep, which his fa|ther had &s;ent him upon more than half a century before; the &s;tory does not &s;ay that he found the&s;e &s;heep, which probably were now become more difficult to recover than upon his fir&s;t &s;earch; he returned however to his father's hou&s;e, and was rather &s;urprized upon di&s;covering a new ge|neration in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who thought no more of Epimenides, than they did of his &s;heep: This &s;leeping philo&s;opher however filled up the gap in his life pretty well, for Xenophanes &s;ays he lived to one hundred and fifty-&s;even years of age; and the Cretans, who are liars upon record, &s;tretch
<PB N="94" REF="100">
their account to two hundred and ninety-nine years, mode&s;tly &s;topping &s;hort of three centuries. Deducting therefore fifty-&s;even years of &s;leep, during which he probably made no great advan|ces in &s;cience, he might have occa&s;ion to go to &s;chool, when he waked, and, though an old man, might be a young &s;cholar under Pythagoras, if the credibility of the above &s;tory can once be admitted.</P>
<P>From the Olympic Games Pythagoras repair|ed to Samos, and opened &s;chool in a place called in the time of Antipho, (who is quoted by Laer|tius) <HI>Pythagorae Hemicyclus.</HI> Here he began a practice he continued in Italy of retiring to a cave without the town for the purpo&s;e of &s;tudy, but in fact the idea was, like mo&s;t others of his, oriental: Hermits have it to this day, and if mortification is u&s;ed to recommend religion, &s;o|litude may be cho&s;en to &s;et off wi&s;dom. Pytha|goras in a cave, vi&s;ited in the dead of night with awful reverence and credulity, might pa&s;s &s;tories upon his hearers, which he could not ri&s;que in the face of the &s;un and the &s;treets of the city.</P>
<P>He was not however &s;o far &s;eque&s;tered from the concerns of the world, as to enjoy him&s;elf in his cave under the tyranny of Polycrates, now more oppre&s;&s;ive than at his departure for Egypt. He thereupon re&s;olved to go into Italy, and took

Delos in his way; here he wrote the ver&s;es on the &s;epulchre of Apollo, which Porphyry records: From Delos he pa&s;&s;ed to Phlius, the ancient country of his family, and at Phlius Cicero in|forms us he expounded &s;everal points of his new philo&s;ophy to the tyrant Leo, who, being &s;truck with his doctrine, demanded of him what branch of &s;cience he principally profe&s;&s;ed: Pythagoras replied that he profe&s;&s;ed none, but was a <HI>Philo|&s;opher:</HI> The name was new to Leo, and he de&s;ired to be informed of its &s;ignification, and wherein philo&s;ophers differed from other profe&s;|&s;ors of the learned &s;ciences: Pythagoras an&s;wer|ed, <HI>That it appeared to him men were drawn to different objects and pur&s;uits in life, as the Greeks were to their Olympic Games, &s;ome for glory, &s;ome for gain; at the &s;ame time,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that others attend without any view to either, for curio&s;ity and amu&s;ement only; &s;o we, who are travellers and adventurers, as it were, from another life and another nature, come among&s;t mankind, indifferent to the ordinary allurements of avarice or ambition, and &s;tudious of nothing but of the truth and e&s;&s;ence of things: Such may be called Lovers of Wi&s;dom, or in one word Philo&s;o|phers; and, like the unconcerned &s;pectators above de&s;cribed, have no other intere&s;ts to pur&s;ue, but the acqui&s;ition of knowledge and the rational enjoyments</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="102">
<HI>of a contemplative mind.</HI>&mdash;In this reply he glances at his doctrine of the Metemp&s;yco&s;is.</P>
<P>In his progre&s;s towards Italy Pythagoras went to Delphi, that he might give the more authority to his precepts upon the pretence of his having received them from the prie&s;te&s;s Theoclea.</P>
<P>In Italy he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf for the remain|der of his life, and taught there forty years wanting one in his colleges at Metapontum, Heraclea, and Croton. He &s;taid twenty years at Croton before he went to Metapontum; Milo, the famous Olympic victor, was one of his &s;cho|lars at the former of the&s;e places. The fame of his doctrines drew a prodigious re&s;ort to his col|lege; no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred di&s;ciples at one time attended his lectures nightly: He impo|&s;ed rules of preparation and a &s;y&s;tem of di&s;ci|pline for his &s;tudents, admirably contrived to in&s;pire them with veneration for his per&s;on, and to train their minds to the exerci&s;es of patience and re&s;pect: He pre&s;cribed a probationary &s;ilence of five years, during which initiation they were not once admitted to the &s;ight of their ma&s;ter, who in the mean time, like an invi&s;ible and &s;u|perior &s;pirit, governed them after the mo&s;t ab&s;o|lute manner by mandates, which they never heard but through the channel of his &s;ubordinate agents: At length they were u&s;hered with much
<PB N="97" REF="103">
ceremony into the awful pre&s;ence. Such a cour&s;e of di&s;cipline could not fail to prepare every mind, capable of undergoing it, for the marvellous &s;tories, which at certain times he introduced into his lectures touching the doc|trine of the Metemp&s;yco&s;is, and the revelation of his own divinity: He &s;crupled not to tell them, that he was the Apollo of the Hyperbo|reans, and he corroborated his a&s;&s;ertion by ex|po&s;ing to view his thigh compo&s;ed of &s;olid gold; his food, which was of the &s;imple&s;t &s;ort, was conveyed to him in his rece&s;s in a manner &s;o &s;ecret, that he was not di&s;covered to be &s;ubject to the common appetites and nece&s;&s;ities of hu|man nature; his per&s;on was mo&s;t comely and commanding, and his dre&s;s of &s;tudied cleanline&s;s and &s;implicity; he was always clad in milk-white garments of the pure&s;t wool; he told them his &s;oul had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal antecedent forms, and that it had originally received from Mer|cury, when it inhabited the body of Aethalides (&s;on of that God) the privilege of migrating after the death of one body into that of another, with the faculty of remembering all the actions of its praeterient &s;tates; that the&s;e tran&s;migra|tions were not immediate, but after intervals, in which his &s;oul vi&s;ited the regions of the other world, and was admitted to the &s;ociety of de|parted
<PB N="98" REF="104">
&s;pirits; that in virtue of this prerogative, it pa&s;&s;ed after &s;ome time from the body of Aetha|lides into that of Euphorbus, who was wounded by Menelaus at the &s;iege of Troy, and in his per&s;on was con&s;cious of what had occurred in that of its predece&s;&s;or; that it next appeared on earth in the per&s;on of Hermotimus, who gave proofs of his remini&s;cence by appealing to the &s;hield &s;u&s;pended in the temple of Apollo by the hands of Menelaus; from Hermotimus it pa&s;&s;ed into one Pyrrhus a fi&s;herman, retaining the like con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and la&s;tly it had lodged it&s;elf, where it now was, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the accumulated recollection of its pa&s;t tran&s;migrations.</P>
<P>Daring as the&s;e fictions were, &s;till they were credited; for the powers of his mind were won|derful, and the authority he had e&s;tabli&s;hed over his hearers by &s;uperior wi&s;dom and ingenious device was unbounded; the curious re&s;earches of his &s;tudy in the Ea&s;t, and the pa&s;&s;ion he had there contracted for the marvellous and &s;uper|natural, in&s;pired him with the ambition of pa&s;&s;ing him&s;elf upon the world for &s;omething above hu|man; he had trained on the credulity of his di&s;|ciples with &s;uch art, that he found it would bear whatever he thought proper to impo&s;e; he was &s;en&s;ible he tran&s;cended all men living in wi&s;dom, and he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority of nature

al&s;o. The idea of tran&s;migration was not &s;tart|ed by Pythagoras; it was of ea&s;tern origin, but too far out of &s;ight for any then alive to trace it to its &s;ource: He told his &s;cholars he &s;hould revi&s;it the earth in two hundred and &s;ix years after his death.</P>
<P>Doctrines like the&s;e were hard to be received, but he &s;o well balanced fiction with truth, that they could not be &s;eparated at the time; the &s;trong fortified the weak &s;o effectually, that both took place together; in mathematics, a&s;tronomy, and moral philo&s;ophy, he was an unrivalled ma&s;|ter; his golden ver&s;es de&s;erved the name: His principles were temperate, moral, humane, and above all things pacifying and conciliatory: when he admitted a di&s;ciple into his pre&s;ence, he took him ever after into his mo&s;t cordial friend|&s;hip and confidence, and men e&s;teemed it the highe&s;t honour of their lives to have pa&s;&s;ed their probation in the &s;chool of Pythagoras, and to be allowed acce&s;s to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>After he had &s;taid twenty years at Croton, he removed to Metapontum, where he had a mag|nificent hou&s;e, which was afterwards converted into a temple to Ceres, and a &s;chool which was called the Mu&s;eum: Here he was vi&s;ited by the famous Abaris, prie&s;t of the Hyperborean Apollo; and his fabulous hi&s;torians give out, that having
<PB N="100" REF="106">
taken Abaris's arrow, he rode upon it through the air to Taurominium in one day, though di&s;|tant from Metapontum &s;ome days &s;ailing. Hear|ing that his aged ma&s;ter Pherecydes was dying of a loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e in Delos, he went thither, and exerted all his art to recover him; and, when he was dead, having buried him with all the ceremonies due to a father, he returned to Italy. This in&s;tance of friend&s;hip is the la&s;t public action I find recorded in his life: The manner of his death is variou&s;ly reported, as well as the age at which he died; the mo&s;t pro|bable account fixes it at eighty years; as to the cata&s;trophe of his death, the relation mo&s;t to be credited informs us, that one Cylon of Croton, a rich, ambitious, and di&s;orderly man, having offered him&s;elf to the college and been rejected by Pythagoras, was &s;o enraged thereby, that having collected a hired mob, he a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of Milo, when Pythagoras and his di&s;ciples were there a&s;&s;embled, and burnt the hou&s;e with every body in it, two or three excepted, who narrowly e&s;caped. Pythagoras, to whom his di&s;ciples even in the la&s;t extremity paid a filial reverence and attention, was &s;olicited to make his e&s;cape; but not being willing to expo&s;e him|&s;elf to the people, as a fugitive anxious to pre|&s;erve life, when his friends were on the point of
<PB N="101" REF="107">
peri&s;hing, he re&s;i&s;ted their entreaties and was burnt to death. To this account I incline; but others contend, that he e&s;caped from the flames, and was killed in pur&s;uit; &s;ome relate that he took refuge in the Mu&s;es' Temple at Metapon|tum, where being kept from victuals forty days, he was &s;tarved; and other hi&s;torians with as little probability on their &s;ide &s;ay, that being pur&s;ued into a bean-plot, he there &s;topped, becau&s;e he would not pa&s;s over prohibited ground, and yielded his throat to the pur&s;uers. After his death his &s;urviving di&s;ciples were di&s;per&s;ed into Greece and the neighbouring countries.</P>

<P>It has been unfortunate for Pythagoras, that the writers of Julian's time, to pay court to the Emperor, &s;hould have corrupted their account of him with &s;o many fictions and ab&s;urdities; for he was truly a very wonderful man: But when they undertook to depreciate the character of Chri&s;t, his doctrines and miracles, by a&s;cribing actions to Pythagoras equal, or, as they con|ceived, &s;uperior to what Chri&s;t had done upon earth, they were driven to &s;trange re&s;ources in deifying their philo&s;opher; for in fact the time was rather pa&s;t for tho&s;e delu&s;ions; deification after death was the mo&s;t that could be attempt|ed, and even the <HI>Julium Sidus</HI> held its place in the heavens by a precarious tenure: At the &s;ame time an <HI>apotheo&s;is</HI> would not &s;erve their purpo&s;e; it was nece&s;&s;ary to make Pythagoras a god or the &s;on of a god, and to give him a &s;upernatural

The heathen teacher was almo&s;t a miracle of erudition; he traver&s;ed the Ea&s;t in pur&s;uit of &s;cience, and collected knowledge, wherever it was to be found, with unremitting indu&s;try: Chri&s;t lived in privacy and ob&s;curity, educated only in the humble trade and occupa|tion of his parents, to whom he was obedient and devoted, till he &s;et out upon the functions of his mi&s;&s;ion. The per&s;on of the fir&s;t was cap|tivating and comely, not to be approached but with awe and adoration, with preparatory pe|nances and rigid initiations, with every artifice to &s;et him off that human wit could devi&s;e; the other was <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men</HI>; the &s;imple&s;t and the meeke&s;t being, that ever walked the earth; conver&s;ing freely with all men, pre&s;ent|ing him&s;elf to the poor and lowly, to women and to little children; in him was <HI>no form of comeli|ne&s;s,</HI> that men &s;hould de&s;ire; no artifice or trick to catch applau&s;e or to excite &s;urprize: If he ex|erci&s;ed his miraculous power in healing the in|firm, or reviving the dead, he did it in &s;ilence,

and under injunction of &s;ecrecy, directing men to pay their thanks to God alone, and forbidding them even to call him good. No magic num|bers, nor my&s;tic &s;ymbols ob&s;cured his doctrines, but he delivered the &s;imple &s;y&s;tem of his pure morality in little ea&s;y anecdotes, levelled to the capacity, and fitted to the memory of the poore&s;t and mo&s;t illiterate. From &s;uch he cho&s;e his di&s;ciples, that the <HI>wi&s;dom of this world</HI> might have no &s;hare in his mini&s;try, and he re&s;ted upon the weake&s;t agents the ta&s;k of preaching and propa|gating the &s;ublime&s;t religion.

thus a&s;&s;erted, or to produce any other argument of Jewi&s;h origin, except this a&s;cribed to the Phari&s;ees by the go&s;pel, either from Cel&s;us, as above mentioned, or any other writer.</P>
<P>Cel&s;us, it is well known, was a very learned man, and wrote in the time of Adrian or &s;ome|thing later; this was not above fifty years after the date of Chri&s;t's miracles. Cel&s;us did not controvert the accounts of them, who were wit|ne&s;&s;es of the miracles, nor attempt to &s;hew any incon&s;i&s;tence or chicanery in the facts them|&s;elves; he takes up at &s;econd hand the old Phari|&s;aical argument of a&s;cribing them to the power of the devil: In &s;hort, they were performed, he can|not deny it; there was no trick or artifice in the performance, he cannot di&s;cover any; the ac|counts of them are no forgeries, he cannot confute them; they are recent hi&s;tories, and their authen|ticity too notorious to be called into que&s;tion; he knows not how the miracles were performed, and therefore they were done by the invocation of the devil; he cannot patiently look on and &s;ee that learning, &s;o long the glory of all civilized nations, and which he him&s;elf was to an eminent degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, now brought into di&s;grace by a new religion, profe&s;&s;ing to be a divine revela|tion, and originating from among&s;t the meane&s;t and mo&s;t odious of all the provincial nations,
<PB N="109" REF="115">
and propagated by di&s;ciples, who were as much de&s;pi&s;ed and hated by the Jews in general, as the Jews were by all other people. Unable to di&s;|prove the account and at a lo&s;s how to parry it from hear&s;ay, or from what he finds in former writers, he has no other re&s;ource, but to bring forward again tho&s;e cavilling Phari&s;ees, and roundly to a&s;&s;ert in general terms, (which he does more than once) that the&s;e miracles are all <HI>the tricks of a &s;orcerer,</HI> and for this he expects the world &s;hould take his authority.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that Cel&s;us adduces neither oral nor written authority again&s;t Chri&s;t's miracles; but I am well aware it may be &s;aid, (and mo|dern cavillers will affect to &s;ay it with triumph) that authorities are &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; <HI>there are none which make mention of the&s;e miracles, at lea&s;t none have come down to our times.</HI>&mdash;If this &s;ilence implies a want of collateral evidence, which in the opinion of our modern di&s;believers vitiates the authenticity of the go&s;pel, how much &s;tronger would the argument have been in Cel|&s;us's time than in ours! Why does he not avail him&s;elf of it? And why does he take &s;uch pains to controvert accounts of which no man had ever &s;poken either in proof or di&s;proof? May it not be fairly pre&s;umed, that he forbears to urge it from plain conviction, that it would operate
<PB N="110" REF="116">
the contrary way to what he wi&s;hed, and that the rea&s;on why contemporary writers were &s;ilent, was not becau&s;e they were ignorant of the facts, but becau&s;e they could not confute them? Here then we will leave the ca&s;e for the pre&s;ent; the heathen writers, contemporary with Chri&s;t, make no mention of his miracles; they are intere&s;ted to di&s;prove them, and they do not di&s;prove them; modern unbelievers think this a rea&s;on that the&s;e miracles were never performed; Cel&s;us writes fifty years after the time, never urges this &s;ilence as an argument for their non-exi&s;tence, but vir|tually, nay expre&s;sly, admits Chri&s;t's miracles, by &s;etting up Pythagoras's in competition with them.</P>
<P>Neither is it Pythagoras alone he compares to Chri&s;t, he &s;tates the performances of Ari&s;teas Proconne&s;ius and Abaris al&s;o. Of Ari&s;teas the fir&s;t account we have is in Herodotus, and he gives it only upon hear&s;ay: He relates that it was reported of him, that he died at Proconne|&s;us, and appeared there &s;even years after, and, having written &s;ome ver&s;es, di&s;appeared; but that two or three hundred years after he had ap|peared again at Metapontum, where by &s;pecial direction of Apollo he was wor&s;hipped as a god: Of Abaris, Cel&s;us relates, that he rode through the air on an arrow, pa&s;&s;ing over mountains and
<PB N="111" REF="117">
&s;eas in his pa&s;&s;age out of Scythia into Greece, and back again into Scythia.</P>
<P>Hence it came to pa&s;s that other heathen wri|ters, after the example of Cel&s;us, publi&s;hed their accounts of Pythagoras and Apollonius Tya|neus; not &s;o much for the purpo&s;e of giving the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e per&s;ons, as to &s;et them up in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples. Por|phyry compo&s;ed the hi&s;tory of Pythagoras after he had written fifteen books profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion; the&s;e were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the Chri&s;tian emperors who &s;ucceeded Gali|enus, in who&s;e time Porphyry wrote his hi&s;tory of Pythagoras in the i&s;land of Sicily, whither he retired in di&s;gu&s;t with the Emperor for his fa|vour to the Chri&s;tians, and would have put him|&s;elf to death with his own hand, if Plotinus had not prevented him. Galienus &s;oon died, and the &s;ucceeding emperors being di&s;po&s;ed to per|&s;ecute the Chri&s;tians, Porphyry publi&s;hed his hi&s;tory. Jamblichus publi&s;hed his account of Pythagoras in the reign of the Emperor Julian, with whom he was in high favour, as the letters of that Emperor &s;ufficiently te&s;tify. Hierocles al&s;o in the time of Diocle&s;ian publi&s;hed two books again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion under the title of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> and for the&s;e was promoted by Galerius from being chief judge at Nicome|dia
<PB N="112" REF="118">
to the government of Alexandria. The&s;e books are now lo&s;t, but we are informed by Eu&s;ebius they were mo&s;tly copied from Cel&s;us, and &s;et up Ari&s;teas, Pythagoras and Apollonius Tyaneus again&s;t Chri&s;t, whom he &s;ays the Chri&s;|tians, on account of his doing a few <HI>teratyai,</HI> call a God, and concludes with the&s;e words, viz. <HI>That it is worth con&s;idering that tho&s;e things of Je&s;us are boa&s;ted of Peter and Paul, and &s;ome others of the like &s;ort, liars and illiterate and im|po&s;tors; but for the&s;e things of Apollonius, we have Maximus and Damis a philo&s;opher, who lived with him, and Philo&s;tratus, men eminent for their learn|ing and lovers of truth.</HI></P>
<P>As for the&s;e witne&s;&s;es to Philo&s;tratus's legend of Apollonius, Maximus's minutes go no farther than to two or three years of Apollonius's life pa&s;&s;ed at Aegae, when he was about twenty years old; and what he had from Damis was a table|book of minutes, which a namele&s;s man, pre|tending to be a relation of Damis, brought to Julia the mother and wife of Caracalla, and were by her given to the Sophi&s;t Philo&s;tratus to dre&s;s up in hand&s;omer language.</P>
<P>Such are the authorities for the legend of Phi|lo&s;tratus, written above a hundred years after the death of Apollonius; who died a few weeks after the Emperor Domitian in the year of Chri&s;t

96. This Apollonius was of the &s;ect of Pytha|goras, and the patrone&s;s of Philo&s;tratus's hi&s;tory was the mon&s;ter Julia, mother and wife to the dete&s;table Caracalla.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems natural to &s;uppo&s;e that any great and &s;ignal revelation of the Divine Will &s;hould be authenticated to mankind by evidences pro|portioned to the importance of the communica|tion. Chri&s;tians contend that in the purity and perfection of their religion, as it was taught by Chri&s;t, and in the miracles which he performed on earth whil&s;t he was teaching, full and &s;uffi|cient evidencies are found of a Divine Revela|tion.</P>
<P>As for the religion of Chri&s;t it &s;peaks for it&s;elf, the book is open, which contains it, and however it may have degenerated in practice through the corruption of them who profe&s;s it, there &s;eems no difference of opinion in the world as to the purity and perfection of its principles: Of the&s;e evidencies therefore, which are gene|rally called internal, I have no need to &s;peak.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120">It is not po&s;&s;ible to make the &s;ame direct ap|peal to the miracles as to the religion of Chri&s;t. Many centuries have revolved &s;ince they have cea&s;ed; nature has long &s;ince re&s;umed her cour&s;e, and retains no traces of them; their evidencies therefore are not, like tho&s;e of Chri&s;t's religion, internal, but hi&s;torical; it mu&s;t however be ac|knowledged, that they are hi&s;torical evidencies of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ort, for the hi&s;torians were eye|witne&s;&s;es of what they relate, and their relations agree.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y therefore to &s;ee, that if the &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity is to be attacked, it is in this part only the attack is to be expected. This has ac|cordingly taken place in three different periods, and in three different modes.</P>
<P>The unbelieving Jews, contemporary with Chri&s;t, before who&s;e eyes the miracles were performed, could not di&s;pute their being done, but they attempted to criminate the doer by ac|cu&s;ing him of a guilty communication with evil &s;pirits, a&s;cribing his &s;upernatural deeds to the power of the devil. The heathens, who had not ocular demon&s;tration, but could not conte&s;t facts &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, made their attack upon his miracles, by in&s;tancing others, who had done things altogether as wonderful, viz. Pythagoras, Abaris, Apollonius, and others.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="121">Thus the matter re&s;ted for many ages, till modern cavillers within the pale of the Chri&s;tian church &s;truck upon a new argument for an at|tack upon Chri&s;t's miracles; and this argument having been woven into a late publication, who&s;e hi&s;torical merit puts it into general circulation, many retailers of infidelity, (and Dr. Mac-Infidel among&s;t the re&s;t,) have caught at it as a di&s;|covery of importance, and as they have con|trived to connect it with topics of more erudi|tion, than the generality of people are furni&s;hed with, on whom they practi&s;e, it has been propa|gated with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, where it has had the advantage of not being under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of this argument lies in the di&s;|covery, that contemporary authorities are &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's miracles: Naturali&s;ts and the authors, who record all curious and ex|traordinary events of their own or of preceding times, make no mention of the wonderful things, which Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have done in the land of Judaea; in &s;hort, the Evangeli&s;ts are left alone in the account, and yet &s;ome things are related by them too general in their extent, and too wonderful in their nature, to have been pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence by the&s;e authors, or in other words not to have had a place in their collec|tions: The elder Pliny and Seneca they tell us
<PB N="116" REF="122">
were living at the time of Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion; the Evangeli&s;ts relate, that there was darkne&s;s over the face of the earth when Chri&s;t gave up the gho&s;t, and this darkne&s;s was miraculous, being out of the cour&s;e of nature, and incidental to the divinity of the per&s;on, who was then offering up his life for the redemption of mankind; again&s;t the veracity of the go&s;pel account relative to this particular prodigy the attack is pointed; and they argue, that if it extended over the whole earth, elder Pliny and Seneca with all others who were then living, mu&s;t have noticed it; if it was local to the province of Judaea, men of their information mu&s;t have heard of it: Each of the&s;e philo&s;ophers has recorded all the great phoenomena of nature, which his curio&s;ity and care could get together, and Pliny in particu|lar has devoted an entire chapter to eclip&s;es of an extraordinary nature, yet does not mention this at the Pa&s;&s;ion: The defection of light, which followed Cae&s;ar's murder was not to be compared with what the go&s;pel relates of the praeternatural darkne&s;s at the Pa&s;&s;ion, and yet mo&s;t of the wri|ters of that age have recorded the former event, whil&s;t all are &s;ilent as to the latter&mdash;<HI>Therefore it did not happen.</HI></P>
<P>This I believe is a fair &s;tate of the argument, and, if there be any merit in the di&s;covery, it
<PB N="117" REF="123">
certainly re&s;ts with the moderns; for neither Cel&s;us, Porphyry, nor his di&s;ciple Jamblichus, have &s;truck upon it, though the fir&s;t-mentioned wrote again&s;t Chri&s;tianity in the time of Adrian, who &s;ucceeded to the empire eighty years after Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion; as for Seneca, he died about thirty years, and elder Pliny three and forty years after Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The fathers of the church it &s;eems are divided in opinion as to the darkne&s;s at Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion being general to the whole earth, or local only to Judaea. As the deci&s;ion of this point does not affect the general que&s;tion, the abettors of the argument are willing to admit with Origen, Beza, and others, that the prodigy &s;hould be un|der&s;tood as local to that part of the world, to which his other miracles were confined, and to who&s;e conviction, if it really happened, it is na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be &s;pecially addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Allowing this, the&s;e rea&s;oners contend that it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have been reported to Rome, and that report mu&s;t have been known to Seneca and elder Pliny, and, being known, mu&s;t have been recorded by one or both. The&s;e po&s;itions merit examination.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point to be taken for granted is, that the miracle of the three hours darkne&s;s upon the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been
<PB N="118" REF="124">
reported to Rome: This report was either to come in the &s;tate di&s;patches of the Procurator Pilate to the court of Tiberius, or from private communications: Of the probability of the fir&s;t ca&s;e the reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf from circum&s;tances; it is merely matter of &s;pecula|tion: It involves a doubt at lea&s;t, whether the Procurator would not &s;ee rea&s;ons per&s;onal, as well as political, again&s;t reporting to the court an event, which at be&s;t tended to his own cri|mination, and which, if he had delivered it for truth, might have alarmed the jealou&s;y, or rou&s;ed the re&s;entment of his &s;overeign. The idea en|tertained by the Jews of deliverance from the Roman yoke by their expected Me&s;&s;ias, was too general to have e&s;caped the knowledge of their watchful tyrants, and it does not &s;eem likely any Roman governor of that province would be forward to report any miracle, or miracles, that had reference to a per&s;on, who having &s;et up a new religion declared him&s;elf that very Me&s;&s;ias, which the Jewi&s;h prophecies foretold &s;hould ap|pear to extirpate the Gentile idolatry: If this be a rea&s;on for the Roman Procurator in Judaea to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, it is no le&s;s &s;o for the people of Rome to reject the reports of the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, if they ventured any; and as for the unbelieving Jews, it is not to be ex|pected
<PB N="119" REF="125">
they would contribute to &s;pread the evi|dencies of Chri&s;t's divinity.</P>
<P>The next point to be taken for granted in the argument under examination is, that this report, if actually made, mu&s;t have been known to the philo&s;opher Seneca and the naturali&s;t Pliny; and I think it may fairly be allowed, that an event of this &s;ort could not well fail of coming to the knowledge of Seneca, and even of Pliny, (tho' he died forty-three years after the time) if the government in Tiberius's reign had been made acquainted with it by authority, and had taken no mea&s;ures for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, or any accounts publi&s;hed at the time re&s;pecting it; for after all it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this event, not being found in Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, nor in Seneca's Enquiries, does not by any means decide the que&s;tion again&s;t any accounts being publi&s;hed, but leaves it &s;till open to conjecture, (and with &s;ome rea&s;on) that &s;uch accounts might have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the heathen Emperors.</P>
<P>But waving any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point, we will pa&s;s to the third and la&s;t po&s;ition, in which it is pre&s;umed, that if this praeternatural eclip&s;e at Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion was known to Seneca and Pliny, one or both mu&s;t have recorded it in their works.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">This I think is begging a que&s;tion very hard|ly to be granted; for the&s;e writers mu&s;t have &s;tated the event, either as a thing credible, or doubtful, or incredible; they mu&s;t either have grounded it upon authority, or reported it upon hear&s;ay; they mu&s;t have admitted it with its date and circum&s;tances at the very cri&s;is when it happened, and in that ca&s;e what would have been the con&s;equence of &s;uch a publication? The Chri&s;tians would naturally have made the application to the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and how dangerous was it for a heathen to admit a fact open to &s;uch an interpretation? A Roman phi|lo&s;opher, giving a &s;erious hi&s;tory of extraordi|nary and prodigious events, would make his court but ill to a heathen per&s;ecuting Emperor, by admitting this into the account, unle&s;s it was to confute it: Now this does not appear to have been in contemplation of Seneca or Pliny in any part of their writings; each of the&s;e authors tells us what he credits and wi&s;hes to be credit|ed, not what he di&s;believes and wi&s;hes to con|fute: The defection of light at the time of Cae|&s;ar's death was the creed of the court; the hi&s;|torians, naturali&s;ts, and even the poets, cele|brated that phoenomenon, and it did not lo&s;e in their relations; but in the ca&s;e of the darkne&s;s at Chri&s;t's death, a believer in Him and his mi|racles
<PB N="121" REF="127">
draws a &s;tronger argument for his belief from the &s;ilence of Seneca and Pliny, than any caviller can urge again&s;t it from the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance: If we admit they knew it and yet did not record it, are we not better founded in &s;uppo&s;ing they were &s;ilent, becau&s;e they could not controvert the fact, than our opponents are in &s;aying it did not pa&s;s, becau&s;e they do not mention it? It is too much to require of wit|ne&s;&s;es, that they &s;hould depo&s;e to a fact, which is to convict them&s;elves: I mu&s;t therefore ap|peal to the candid reader, whether a philo&s;opher writing in the court of Nero, who had charged the Chri&s;tians with the burning of Rome, and was devi&s;ing terrible and unheard-of modes of torturing them upon this charge, who had be|headed Paul and crucified Peter for preaching Chri&s;t and the redemption of mankind earned by his Pa&s;&s;ion, whether a heathen philo&s;opher I &s;ay writing at this very time an account of ex|traordinary, but what he delivers as true, events in nature would venture upon putting into his account a miracle, tending to confirm the divine nature and mi&s;&s;ion of that per&s;on, who&s;e imme|diate followers were then &s;uffering under the mo&s;t determined per&s;ecution? No heathen wri|ter in his &s;en&s;es would have ventured to give &s;uch an account. Peter and Paul declared for
<PB N="122" REF="128">
the miracle, and were martyred for their doc|trine; the go&s;pel account declared for the mi|racle and no one Roman writer controverted the a&s;&s;ertion; this was the time for Seneca, for Pliny and other heathen writers to cry out again&s;t the glaring fiction, <HI>Do the Chri&s;tians &s;ay there was a general darkne&s;s when their ma&s;ter expired? We appeal to the fact again&s;t them; it reached not us at Rome; the light of that day was like the light of other days: Do they &s;ay it was partial to Judaea only? Be it &s;o! We meet them on their own ground; we appeal to the Procu|rator Pilate, to the noble Romans re&s;ident in Ju|daea, to the &s;oldiers, to the very Centurion, who attended his execution, to witne&s;s again&s;t this im|pudent attack upon men's &s;en&s;es. Let them pretend that he healed the &s;ick, cured the lame, turned water into wine, or performed a thou&s;and other juggling tricks, but darkne&s;s over a whole province can be confuted by the te&s;timony of a whole province, and to this we appeal.</HI>&mdash;Was this &s;aid? Was this appeal made? Strange perver&s;ion of rea&s;on to turn that into an argument again&s;t a thing, which &s;eems conclu&s;ive for it! at lea&s;t no nega|tive can come nearer to conclu&s;ion, than con|temporary &s;ilence in a ca&s;e &s;o open to confuta|tion, had it not been true.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="129"><HI>But Seneca and elder Pliny did not &s;ee the go&s;pel</HI>&mdash;Let it pa&s;s; let us grant all that the ar|gument &s;uppo&s;es; why are we told of no con|futation of this miracle by any heathen writer contemporary with, or po&s;terior to the go&s;pel account of the Pa&s;&s;ion? The a&s;&s;ertion of a prae|ternatural event, &s;o generally notorious, mu&s;t have been open to proof. Would Cel&s;us have overlooked it? Would not Lucian have taken it up? Should not we hear of its having been urged by Porphyry, who was &s;o voluminous a controver&s;iali&s;t? Should not we meet it in Juli|an or Philo&s;tratus? Should we hear nothing, that could lead us to believe it was controverted by Jamblichus, or Hierocles in his books entitled Philalethes? If the &s;ilence of the heathen writers is to be appealed to for the purpo&s;e of impeach|ing Chri&s;t's miracles, let the appeal be made; whil&s;t we confine our&s;elves to the defence of tho&s;e miracles only, which are recorded in the Go&s;pels and Acts of the Apo&s;tles, neither the &s;ilence of ancient, nor the eloquence of modern opponents, can &s;hake the records, on which we ground our faith.</P>

<P>Ogyges is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the founder of the Athenian monarchy, but in what aera of the world we &s;hall place this illu&s;trious per&s;on, whether he was Noah or one of the
<PB N="126" REF="132">
Titans, grand&s;on to Jupiter or contemporary with Mo&s;es, is an enquiry, which the learned have agitated with much zeal and very little &s;ucce&s;s. It is however agreed that there was a grievous flood in his time, which deluged the province afterwards called Attica; but that hap|pily for King Ogyges, being a per&s;on of gigan|tic &s;tature he &s;urvived the general calamity. A period of one hundred and eighty-nine years &s;uc|ceeded to this flood, in which this province re|mained &s;o depopulated, that it is generally &s;up|po&s;ed no king reigned over it till the time of Cecrops, the founder of Athens, from him at fir&s;t named Cecropia.</P>
<P>Cecrops made many prudent in&s;titutes for the benefit of his ri&s;ing &s;tate during a long reign of fifty years, and, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the rites of ma|trimony, aboli&s;hed the promi&s;cuous commerce of the &s;exes, in which they lived before his time; by the&s;e and other regulations upon a general numbering of all his &s;ubjects, he found the male adults in his dominions to amount to twenty thou&s;and, every per&s;on of the above de&s;cription being directed to bring a &s;tone in his hand and ca&s;t it down in a &s;tated place: This prince, be|ing an Egyptian, introduced the mythology of his native country, upon which &s;o many Grecian fables were formed, and from which a learned
<PB N="127" REF="133">
modern has with great &s;agacity traced a very curious analogy with the Mo&s;aic accounts of the early ages: The Greeks adopted the fables with|out comprehending their allu&s;ions, and thereupon formed the con&s;titution of a religion, which kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great part of the world, till reve|lation di&s;pelled its errors and enlightened the Gentile nations. Till Cecrops erected altars to Jupiter, made libations and e&s;tabli&s;hed his wor|&s;hip, he was not known in Greece as a God: He &s;et up the image of Mercury, &s;acrificed to Saturn, Ops, Rhea, Juno, and Minerva, and was in fact the in&s;titutor of the Pagan theology: The gods of Cecrops were &s;oon made u&s;eful in|&s;truments in the hand of the founder of a mo|narchy, for before he could induce his people to cultivate the dry and barren country of Attica, he was forced to play off his new machinery, by rai&s;ing a conte&s;t in heaven between Neptune and Minerva for the patronage of Cecropia, the capital of his new empire: He found intere&s;t enough with the deities to turn their deci&s;ion in Minerva's favour; and by this contrivance he diverted his &s;ubjects from their maritime attach|ments to agriculture, and particularly to the cul|tivation of the olive: To &s;trengthen &s;till further the tutelary title of Minerva, he enforced the dedication of the city by changing its name from
<PB N="128" REF="134">
Cecropia to Athenae, a &s;acrifice few founders would have made, and a &s;trong proof of his good &s;en&s;e and talents for government. If the reader recollects the &s;tory Ovid relates of Minerva's treatment of Erichthonius, Cecrops's &s;on, he will not conceive highly of the gratitude, or even purity of that virgin deity's character; though as we are &s;etting out upon the Athenian ground, it may be not very prudent to talk &s;candal of Minerva;
<Q>At virgo e&s;t&mdash;negat Aglaurus, negat anguis apertus.
<BIBL>(DAR. PHRYG. lib. 2.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Cecrops enjoyed his new government for the &s;pace of fifty years, but his attachment to his native &s;oil of Egypt drew him into an unlucky expedition with King Pharaoh, in who&s;e com|pany he was drowned in the Red Sea, whil&s;t in pur&s;uit of the I&s;raelites; notwith&s;tanding which we are informed upon the authority of the poet Euripides, that he was tran&s;lated into the &s;tarry &s;phere, and became a con&s;tellation of &s;ome dig|nity after his death; and if we con&s;ider what obligations this prince had conferred on the gods, as well as men, we &s;hall not think him too highly rewarded; on the contrary we mu&s;t own he was rather hardly dealt with both by Minerva as well as Mercury; the former of which &s;hut his &s;on in a che&s;t in company with a dragon,
<PB N="129" REF="135">
and the latter betrayed his daughter into a fal&s;e &s;tep; an attachment, which though it does not convict her of vulgarity of ta&s;te, certainly does no credit to the cha&s;tity of her morals, or the gratitude of her &s;educer.</P>
<P>Cranaus &s;ucceeded on the death of Cecrops, and after a reign of nine years was depo&s;ed by Amphictyon, who &s;eized the throne of Athens and rendered his name memorable to po&s;terity by e&s;tabli&s;hing the great Council or Law-Courts of the Amphictyons, who held their meetings at Thermopylae. This prince introduced the practice of diluting and mixing wines; a practice that obtained through all Greece for many ages; in memory of which &s;ober in&s;titution, Amphic|tyon erected an altar to Bacchus the Upright and placed it in the Temple of the Hours: He al&s;o con&s;ecrated an altar to the nymphs near at hand in the &s;ame temple, that mankind might thereby be kept in mind of the gracefulne&s;s of temperance, and it is not ea&s;y to find any in&s;tance in the pagan wor&s;hip, where &s;uper&s;tition has been applied to more elegant or moral purpo&s;es. In &s;mall communities &s;uch regulations may be car|ried into effect, where all the people are under the eye of the &s;overeign, and in the &s;ame &s;pirit of reformation Amphictyon publi&s;hed an edict, that none of his &s;ubjects &s;hould indulge them|&s;elves
<PB N="130" REF="136">
in the u&s;e of undiluted wine, except in one &s;mall gla&s;s after their meals to give them a ta&s;te of the potency of the god; under this re&s;triction he permitted the free u&s;e of diluted wines, pro|vided they ob&s;erved in their meetings to addre&s;s their libations to Jupiter the pre&s;erver of man's health.</P>
<P>This virtuous u&s;urper, after an admini&s;tration of ten years, was in his turn expelled from the throne of Athens by that Erechthonius, the &s;on of Cecrops, whom Minerva &s;hut up in a che&s;t with his companion the dragon, and committed to the keeping of his &s;i&s;ters: This is the per&s;on whom Homer mentions in his &s;econd book of the Iliad by the name of Erechtheus: He is ce|lebrated for having fir&s;t yoked hor&s;es to a cha|riot, and al&s;o for introducing the u&s;e of &s;ilver coin in Attica.<Q><L>Primus Erechthonius currus et quatuor au&s;us</L>
<L>Jungere Equos, rapidi&s;&abque; rotis in&s;i&s;tere Victor.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the in&s;titutions which have rendered the name of Erechthonius famous to all po&s;terity, are tho&s;e of the Eleu&s;ynian My&s;teries and the fea&s;ts of the Panathenaea. The fir&s;t of the&s;e he e&s;tabli&s;hed in honour of Ceres, on account of a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply of corn from the granaries of Egypt, when the city and territory of Athens
<PB N="131" REF="137">
were in imminent danger of &s;tarving by an extraordinary drought: The&s;e &s;acred my&s;teries were of Egyptian origin, and as they con&s;i&s;ted of forms and rites, unintelligible to the vulgar, and probably very little comprehended even by the initiated, the &s;ecret was well kept.</P>
<P>As for the Panathenaea, they were in&s;tituted, as their name indicates, in honour of Minerva, and were the great fe&s;tival of the Athenians: The celebration was originally comprized in one day, but afterwards it was extended to &s;eve|ral, and the various athletic games and races, with the recitation of poems, that accompanied it, attracted an immen&s;e re&s;ort of &s;pectators. Every &s;pecies of contention, both on foot and hor&s;eback, drew the bold and adventrous to the field of fame, whil&s;t the prizes for mu&s;ic and the rival di&s;play of the drama in after-times recreated the aged, the elegant, and the learned: The conquerors in the &s;everal games gave entertain|ments to their friends, in which they pre&s;ided crowned with olive in honour of the guardian deity: The&s;e were &s;cenes of the greate&s;t fe&s;ti|vity, till, when Athens had &s;ubmitted to the Roman yoke, tho&s;e &s;anguinary conquerors intro|duced the combats of gladiators into the&s;e favo|rite &s;olemnities. Every age had its &s;hare in con|tributing to the &s;pectacle; the old men walked

in proce&s;&s;ion with branches of olive in their hands, the young in armour with &s;hield and &s;pear; the labouring pea&s;ants with &s;pades, and their wives with water-buckets: The boys crowned with garlands, and dre&s;&s;ed in frocks or &s;urplices of white, chaunted hymns to Mi|nerva; and the girls followed with ba&s;kets, in which the &s;acrificing uten&s;ils were contained.</P>
<P>A &s;uper&s;tition, &s;upported by &s;plendor, and en|livened with fe&s;tivity, was well calculated to keep a la&s;ting hold upon the human mind.</P>

<P>THE Eleu&s;ynian My&s;teries, in&s;tituted by Erechthonius, were celebrated in the time of autumn every fifth year at Eleu&s;is, where a great concour&s;e of people met upon the occa&s;ion: The ceremonies of initiation were preceded by &s;acrifices, prayers, and ablutions; the candidates were exerci&s;ed in trials of &s;ecrecy and prepared by vows of continence; every circum&s;tance was contrived to render the act as awful and &s;triking as po&s;&s;ible; the initiation was performed at mid|night, and the candidate was taken into an inte|rior &s;acri&s;ty of the temple with a myrtle garland
<PB N="133" REF="139">
on his head; here he was examined if he had duly performed his &s;tated ablutions; clean hands, a pure heart, and a native proficiency in the Greek tongue were indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ites; having pa&s;&s;ed this examination, he was admitted into the temple, which was an edifice of im|men&s;e magnitude; after proclamation made that the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ilence &s;hould be ob&s;erved, the offi|ciating prie&s;t took out the &s;acred volumes con|taining the my&s;teries; the&s;e books were written in a &s;trange character, inter&s;per&s;ed with the figures of animals and various emblems and hieroglyphics; they were pre&s;erved in a cavity between two large blocks of &s;tone, clo&s;ely fitted to each other, and they were carefully replaced by the prie&s;t with much &s;olemnity, after he had explained what was nece&s;&s;ary to the initiated out of them. The initiated were enjoined to honour their parents, to reverence the immortal gods, and ab&s;tain from particular &s;orts of diet, particu|larly tame fowls, fi&s;h, beans, and certain &s;orts of apples.</P>
<P>When this was fini&s;hed the prie&s;ts began to play off the whole machinery of the temple in all its terror; doleful groans and lamentations broke out from the fane, thick and &s;udden dark|ne&s;s involved the temple, momentary gleams of light fla&s;hed forth every now and then with
<PB N="134" REF="140">
tremblings, as if an earthquake had &s;haken the edifice; &s;ometimes the&s;e coru&s;cations continued long enough to di&s;cover all the &s;plendor of the &s;hrines and images, accompanied with voices in concert, dancings and mu&s;ic; at other times during the darkne&s;s &s;everities were exerci&s;ed upon the initiated by per&s;ons un&s;een; they were dragged to the ground by the hair of their heads, and there beaten and la&s;hed, without knowing from whom the blows proceeded, or why they were inflicted: Lightnings and thunderings and dreadful apparitions were occa&s;ionally played off with every invention to terrify and a&s;toni&s;h; at length upon a voice crying out <HI>Conx! Ompax!</HI> the ceremony was concluded and the initiated di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The garment worn upon this occa|&s;ion was not to be laid a&s;ide, whil&s;t it would hang together, and the &s;hreds were then to be dedicated at &s;ome &s;hrine, as a tattered trophy of the due performance of the my&s;teries of Ceres.</P>
<P>The&s;e initiations were conceived to lead to the enjoyment of a happier lot in this life, and to fit a man for a more dignified place among&s;t the ble&s;t hereafter; and they were in &s;uch gene|ral re&s;pect, that it afforded great cau&s;e of re|proach again&s;t Socrates, for having neglected his initiation. The vows of &s;ecrecy and the
<PB N="135" REF="141">
penalties to be inflicted on violation, were as binding as could po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Hitherto the ri&s;ing &s;tate of Athens had not been engaged in war, but no &s;ooner was it in|volved in di&s;putes with the Eleu&s;ynians on ac|count of &s;ome praedatory incur&s;ions, than the idea took its ri&s;e of devoting human victims to appea&s;e the ho&s;tile divinities and to purcha&s;e conque&s;t by the oblation of what was deare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable in life.</P>
<P>As we are now approaching towards the time of Homer, who records in&s;tances of this &s;ort, it may be curious to mark when that &s;avage &s;uper|&s;tition had its origin. No example occurs to me in Grecian &s;tory antecedent to Erechtho|nius, who in obedience to an oracle, &s;acrificed one of his daughters, and &s;ome &s;ay all, to pur|cha&s;e thereby &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Eleu&s;ynians. It is however a matter of le&s;s wonder than regret how this idea &s;hould obtain &s;o generally; when a people are in the habit of making animal &s;acri|fices a part of their wor&s;hip, and who&s;e religion it is to believe that interce&s;&s;ion can be made to the gods, and favours obtained by the blood of victims taken from the brute creation, the thought of a&s;cending a &s;tep higher in the dignity of the oblation naturally leads to the hope of purcha&s;ing a greater reward. With the&s;e ideas
<PB N="136" REF="142">
enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirits, like Decius and Curtius among&s;t the Romans, ru&s;hed upon &s;elf-de&s;truc|tion, and Erechthonius, king of Athens, devoted his daughter, Codrus him&s;elf&mdash;<HI>If the blood of bulls and goats and the a&s;hes of a heifer, &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. There is a wild magnanimity in the idea highly captiva|ting; Cicero more than once alludes to this action of Erechthonius, and in his oration for Sextus exclaims&mdash;<HI>Shall I after &s;o many illu&s;tri|ous deeds &s;hrink from death, which even the daugh|ters of Erechthonius, with all the weakne&s;s of their &s;ex about them, re&s;igned them&s;elves to without re|gret?</HI> Let the mind be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the per|&s;ua&s;ion of immortal happine&s;s annexed to the act, and there will be no want of candidates to &s;trug|gle for the glorious prerogative. Erechthonius and his daughters were a&s;&s;ociated to the deities after their death, altars were dedicated and a temple erected to them in the citadel of Athens, where divine honours were paid to their memo|ries. The Eleu&s;ynians were defeated and de|&s;poiled of all they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, except the my&s;teries of Ceres abovementioned; of the&s;e they were left in undi&s;turbed enjoyment: Their king Eu|molpus was &s;lain in battle, but Neptune, who&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="143">
&s;on he was, revenged his lo&s;s by &s;triking his conqueror dead with his trident.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed Erechthonius by immortal hands, if we take the authority of Euripides the tragic poet, after he had reigned fifty years in Athens: In his time the people of Attica, here|tofore called Cecropians, took the name of Athenians: Ovid, who&s;e metamorpho&s;es mix much ancient truth with fable, &s;ays <HI>that this prince at his death left it doubtful with po&s;terity, whether he excelled mo&s;t in ju&s;tice as a King, or in military glory as a General.</HI></P>
<P>Aegeus, the reputed father of The&s;eus, was the eighth king of Athens, reckoning from Ce|crops, and &s;on of Pandion II. grand&s;on of Erech|thonius, the crown having de&s;cended regularly from father to &s;on through &s;everal generations: After remaining childle&s;s for &s;everal years he con&s;ulted the oracle at Delphi upon the mode of obtaining an heir; to a very plain que&s;tion he obtained a very ob&s;cure an&s;wer, and, not being able to &s;olve the aenigma him&s;elf, con&s;ulted &s;eve|ral per&s;ons upon the interpretation of it, and among&s;t others his friend Pittheus, king of Troezene, from who&s;e &s;agacity he promi&s;ed him&s;elf a &s;olution of the difficulty: This wi&s;e prince had a daughter named Aethra, and &s;he having admitted Aegeus to a &s;ecret con&s;ultation
<PB N="138" REF="144">
by night in the fane of Minerva, proved a more able interpreter of the Delphic oracle than her father, and put Aegeus in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wi&s;hes by bearing him a &s;on: This &s;on was the hero The&s;eus, but it cannot be di&s;gui&s;ed, that a doubt was &s;tarted, whether Neptune had not a better claim to the child than Aegeus; for the prince&s;s Aethra is charged with admitting both vi&s;iters in the &s;ame evening, and when the con|trover&s;y lies between a mortal and an immortal lover, the mo&s;t that can be &s;aid for Aegeus is, that it leaves the ca&s;e doubtful. The king of Athens put in his claim by leaving his &s;word and &s;andals in cu&s;tody of Aethra, when he un|der&s;tood &s;he was pregnant, enjoining her to let the child, if he proved a &s;on, remain at Troe|zene, until he became adult and had &s;trength enough to remove a block of &s;tone, under which he depo&s;ited his pledges; on the hilt of the &s;word, which was ivory, he cau&s;ed to be en|graved his name and titles, and Aegeus declared he would acknowledge the bearer of tho&s;e pledges and adopt him as his heir: This being done, he returned to Athens and celebrated the Panathenaea with uncommon &s;plendor.</P>
<P>This monarch filled the throne of Athens for the &s;pace of forty-eight years and terminated his life by ca&s;ting him&s;elf into the &s;ea, thence
<PB N="139" REF="145">
called Aegean, in de&s;pair upon di&s;covering the ve&s;&s;el, that brought his &s;on The&s;eus from his Cretan expedition again&s;t the Minotaur, approach the &s;hores of Attica with black &s;ails, when the &s;ignal of life and victory was to be the contrary di&s;play of white ones, which The&s;eus by a fatal neglect had failed to put out upon his coming in &s;ight of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The impatient and de&s;pairing parent precipi|tated him&s;elf into the ocean and the &s;on &s;uc|ceeded to his throne. There is no hero in anti|quity, who for his magnanimity, his adventures, or the exqui&s;ite beauty and perfection of his per|&s;on has been more celebrated than The&s;eus: In &s;ome of the actions of his life he performed real and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices to his country; in others he appears to have been governed mere|ly by an extravagant and wild pa&s;&s;ion for adven|ture: No hero has furni&s;hed more themes to the poets, and few princes have at times de&s;erved better of their &s;ubjects: By his valour in action and the terror of his name he cleared many re|gions of tho&s;e lawle&s;s clans of robbers and plun|derers, with which they were infe&s;ted to the di&s;grace and danger of &s;ociety: Ambitious to emulate the fame of his contemporary Hercules, he &s;eems &s;ometimes to have forgotten that he had &s;ubjects under his care and command, and
<PB N="140" REF="146">
roved about in que&s;t of adventures, the general champion of di&s;tre&s;s and the &s;worn exterminator of mon&s;ters and tyrants, wherever they were to be found: Preceded by his axe-bearers in com|memoration of his de&s;truction of the robbers, and carrying on his &s;houlder the ponderous club of Corynaetes, whom he vanqui&s;hed, he marched in triumph to Delphi, like another Her|cules after his labours: The bulls of Crete and Marathon and the Cremmyonian boar were tro|phies, that might vie with the hydra; and Cor|cyon, whom he &s;lew, was as formidable a cham|pion as Antaeus, and fixed the triumph of agi|lity over &s;trength: He killed Procru&s;tes, who&s;e couch was as fatal as the den of Cacus.</P>
<P>The&s;eus upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the government of Attica reformed the &s;tate of ju&s;tice and amend|ed the condition of his &s;ubjects by many kingly regulations; before his time the people were di&s;|per&s;ed about the country in &s;mall and &s;eparated clans, more like the &s;ettlements of &s;avages than a regular community; the police of cour&s;e was very imperfect; the laws were merely local and arbitrary, nor did they generally agree in the &s;ame definition or di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice; to re|medy the&s;e evils he enlarged his capital, a&s;&s;em|bled the people from all parts, fixed them to a re&s;idence in Athens and e&s;tabli&s;hed general courts
<PB N="141" REF="147">
of law and ju&s;tice, where all his &s;ubjects might re&s;ort to decide their properties, or compo&s;e their wrongs, by &s;tated rules and in&s;titutes, expound|ed and admini&s;tered by judges competent to their vocation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ervices beneficial to mankind, the actions of a patriot king and legi&s;lator, infinitely &s;uperior to the extermination of boars or bulls, the unravelling a labyrinth, or conflicting with a wre&s;tler. One &s;hould have thought that the rambling &s;pirit of The&s;eus might henceforward have &s;ub&s;ided, and, if Hercules had not been upon earth, this would probably have been the ca&s;e, and he would have de&s;cended to po&s;terity one of the greate&s;t characters in ancient hi&s;tory; but the expedition again&s;t the Amazons drew him out upon fre&s;h and fooli&s;h adventures, and, though his friend&s;hip and his amours may have furni&s;hed plea&s;ing tales and fables to He&s;iod and others, the hi&s;torian will do well to pa&s;s over this period of his life in &s;ilence and regret.</P>
<P>It &s;uffices to relate that Mene&s;theus took ad|vantage of his ab&s;ence and e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o firmly in power, that The&s;eus on his return finding it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his u&s;urp|ed authority retired to Scyros, and there either put a voluntary end to his life, or was de&s;troyed by Lycomedes.</P>

<P>THE expedition of the Greeks again&s;t Troy has &s;upplied a &s;ubject to an heroic poem, which remains the wonder of all time and the unrivalled &s;tandard of the epic art.

The event it&s;elf was magnificent; a coalition of the Grecian &s;tates in vindication of an injured prince, who was one of their number. Had it recorded the expedition of one great monarch again&s;t another, it is ea&s;y to comprehend how much that brilliant variety of character, which now gives &s;uch dra|matic lu&s;tre to the compo&s;ition, would have lo&s;t by the nature of &s;uch a &s;ubject; whereas the emulation of the rival leaders con&s;titutes that compound action, that &s;triking contra&s;t and di&s;|crimination of character, which render the Iliad &s;o peculiarly enchanting.

<P>If Homer found the&s;e incidents ready to his hands, their combination was &s;upremely happy; if he created them, his invention was almo&s;t mi|raculous. The period at which he wrote was no le&s;s fortunate, being neither too remote to impair the intere&s;t of his &s;ubject, nor &s;o near the time of the action as to confine his fancy to the limits of &s;trict hi&s;torical truth. So wonderful an a&s;&s;emblage of parts meet in this great work, that there is not a pa&s;&s;ion in the human brea&s;t but will find its ruling intere&s;t gratified by the peru&s;al; and it is &s;o happily contrived, that the combination of tho&s;e parts, multitudinous as they are, never violates the uniformity of de&s;ign; the &s;ubject remains &s;imple and entire; our ideas never &s;tray from the main object of the poem, though they are continually carried out upon ex|cur&s;ions through the regions of earth and heaven upon the &s;tronge&s;t pinions of fancy. The man|ner in which Homer employs his deities, with the machinery that accompanies them, gives an amazing brilliancy to the picture&s;que and de|&s;criptive

powers of the poem; the virtues, vices, prejudices, pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e imaginary beings &s;et them on a level with human nature &s;o far as to give us an intere&s;t in their &s;ituations, which a ju&s;ter repre&s;entation of &s;uperior e&s;&s;ences could not impart; while their immortality and power are engines in the poet's hand, who&s;e influence is unlimited by the laws of nature; the&s;e extra|ordinary per&s;onages, at the &s;ame time that they take a part very e&s;&s;ential to the action of the drama, bring about the incidents by tho&s;e &s;ud|den and &s;upernatural means, which mortal he|roes of the mo&s;t romantic &s;ort could not &s;o rea|dily effect. This is an advantage on the part of a heathen poet, for which the Chri&s;tian writer has no &s;ub&s;titute; for tho&s;e moderns, who in or|der to create &s;urprize have invented capricious beings to produce extravagant events above the reach of human powers, and below the dignity of divine, violate our rea&s;on, whil&s;t they &s;truggle to amu&s;e our fancy; but the Pagan theori&s;t can find a deity for every purpo&s;e without giving &s;candal to the believer, or revolting the philo&s;o|pher.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the numberle&s;s excellencies of the Iliad there is none more to be admired than the correct preci&s;ion, with which Homer draws his characters and pre&s;erves them uniformly through
<PB N="146" REF="152">
the poem; an excellence, in which Virgil and the Roman poets in general are greatly his in|feriors: With Homer's heroes we have more than hi&s;torical acquaintance, we are made inti|mate with their habits and manners, and when|ever he withdraws them for a time, we are certain upon the next meeting to recognize and acknowledge the &s;ame characteri&s;tic traces that &s;eparate each individual &s;o decidedly from all others.&mdash;But it is time to return to our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>After the death of Mene&s;theus the crown of Athens returned into the family of The&s;eus, and Demophon his &s;on, who al&s;o was pre&s;ent at the &s;iege of Troy, &s;ucceeded to his inheritance: Oxyntes, Aphidas, and Thymaetes reigned in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion after Demophon, and the line of the Erechthidae expired in the per&s;on of Thymaetes. This was a remarkable revolution, for that fa|mily had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne of Athens for a period of four hundred and twenty-nine years. The monarchy, properly &s;o called, was now drawing to its conclu&s;ion; Melanthus, who &s;uc|ceeded to Thymaetes, was a Me&s;&s;enian and a de&s;cendant from Neleus; he had been expelled from Me&s;&s;ene by the Heraclidae, and had taken refuge in the Athenian &s;tate; he obtained the crown by very honourable means; Thymaetes,
<PB N="147" REF="153">
being challenged to &s;ingle combat by Xanthus king of Boeotia, declined the challenge; Melan|thus accepted it in his &s;tead, &s;lew Xanthus, and obtained the crown of Athens in reward for his &s;ucce&s;s; at his death it devolved to his &s;on Co|drus. The manner in which this prince devoted him&s;elf to death for his country &s;carce needs a recital, but it is not generally known that Co|drus was in a very advanced age, when this event took place, and moreover that the Atheni|ans urged him to the deed upon the report of Cleomantis, a citizen of Delphi, who made them acquainted with the an&s;wer of the oracle touch|ing the conditions, on which victory was to be obtained. The Athenians, having prevailed with Codrus to embrace the fatal conditions of their deliverance, &s;acrificed their aged monarch, and impre&s;&s;ed with the per&s;ua&s;ion that Apollo would verify his prediction, fought and over|came their enemy.</P>
<P>Codrus being dead, the government of Athens underwent a material revolution, for the popular party, pretending a re&s;pect to his memory, put forward a decree prohibiting any other per&s;on to reign in Athens by the title of King; the change however for the pre&s;ent was more nominal than e&s;&s;ential, for they did not alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, nor materially reduce the power of the monarchy.
<PB N="148" REF="154">
The Prince, or perpetual Archon, (for each title is u&s;ed occa&s;ionally) held the government for life, &s;ubject notwith&s;tanding to account to the &s;tate for his admini&s;tration of public affairs.</P>
<P>Medon, &s;on of Codrus, &s;ucceeded to his father by this new title: Thirteen princes reigned un|der this de&s;cription from Medon to Alcmaeon inclu&s;ive, comprehending a period of three hun|dred and &s;even years.</P>
<P>Some authorities maintain that Homer came to Athens in the time of Medon, and was ho&s;|pitably received by that prince; but it is gene|rally thought the age of Homer does not an&s;wer to this date, and that he was born about two hundred years after the &s;iege of Troy; this falls within the time of Archippus, grand&s;on of Me|don, and third perpetual archon; in the begin|ning of who&s;e reign He&s;iod was born; Homer &s;ome few years after at the clo&s;e of it: Archip|pus reigned nineteen years; and this aera &s;eems e&s;tabli&s;hed by the be&s;t chronologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Archippus, at the conclu&s;ion of who&s;e admi|ni&s;tration we have placed the birth of Homer, was &s;ucceeded by Ther&s;ippus, who held the go|vernment of Athens for a long incumbency of forty-one years, and he was &s;ucceeded by Phor|bas, who was thirty years archon; in the period
<PB N="149" REF="155">
of the&s;e &s;eventy-one years we have the Athenian aera of the life of Homer.</P>
<P>This however mu&s;t in &s;ome degree be left to opinion, for before the in&s;titution of the Olympi|ads the Grecian chronicles are &s;o vague and ob|&s;cure that the preci&s;e age of Homer will for ever remain a &s;ubject of conjecture. The above pe|riod has at lea&s;t the merit of holding a middle place between their opinions, who &s;uppo&s;e he was born &s;oon after the &s;iege of Troy and &s;uch as contend he was contemporary with Lycurgus. The late Mr. Robert Wood, in his e&s;&s;ay on the original genius and writings of Homer, inclines to think the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey were fini&s;hed about half a century after the capture of Troy; he has offered internal evidence in &s;upport of this opinion in Homer's account of the family of Aeneas, and his argument is acute and criti|cal: They, who make him contemporary with Lycurgus, have internal evidence again&s;t them, which, though perhaps it does not &s;erve to e&s;ta|bli&s;h Mr. Wood's po&s;ition, certainly confutes the latter chronologi&s;ts. Ari&s;totle places Homer in the &s;ame epoch with Iphitus and the fir&s;t Olympiad, but he re&s;ts his conjecture upon the weake&s;t of all arguments; whil&s;t the be&s;t autho|rities, as well as the majority in number, point
<PB N="150" REF="156">
to the period which I have &s;ugge&s;ted; and here for the pre&s;ent I will leave it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t but one of the perpetual archons was Ae&s;chylus, and in the &s;econd year of his go|vernment the Olympiads were fir&s;t in&s;tituted by Iphitus at Elis; from this period we &s;hall proceed with greater chronological preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Ae&s;chylus and the la&s;t of the perpetual archons was Alcmaeon. The people of Athens had new-modelled their government upon the death of Codrus by aboli&s;hing the title of King, and reducing their chief magi&s;trate to be in fact rather the fir&s;t &s;ubject of the &s;tate, than the monarch: This regulation appears to have been effected without any &s;truggle on the part of the reigning family; thirteen archons in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had now been permitted to hold the government for life, when upon the expiration of Alcmaeon's admini&s;tration, the people thought fit by a fre&s;h reform to limit the duration of the chief magi&s;tracy to the term of ten years. Cha|rops, brother of Alcmaeon and &s;on of Ae&s;chylus, was the fir&s;t decennial archon; and this revolution took place in the fir&s;t year of the &s;eventh Olym|piad. Whil&s;t the Athenian &s;tate was by the&s;e &s;teps enlarging its liberties, Romulus and Remus were forming the embryo of a mighty empire fated in the cour&s;e of time to become mi&s;tre&s;s of the
<PB N="151" REF="157">
world; the&s;e adventurers collected a body of Latin &s;hepherds, among&s;t whom they had been educated, and, &s;ettling them&s;elves on the Pala|tine Mount, became the founders of Rome: This event is &s;uppo&s;ed to fall within the period of the &s;eventh Olympiad, when Charops was decennial archon. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that this mighty empire was &s;et in motion from one &s;park, which Greece had &s;cattered from the con|flagration of Troy, and which lighted on the &s;hores of Italy, where it was kept alive for more than four centuries, till Rome was founded; but Aeneas's Italian colonization is a very que&s;|tionable point, and I am inclined to agree with Mr. Wood in his treati&s;e abovementioned, that the po&s;terity of Aeneas did not migrate into Italy, but e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the Troade and reigned over the &s;cattered remains of the Trojans after the de&s;truction of Ilium.</P>
<P>A revolution of eighteen Olympiads produced a third change in the con&s;titution of the Athe|nian government in favour of popular freedom, by limiting the archons to one year, making the magi&s;tracy annual: Neither was this all, for the command was no longer lodged in the hands of one per&s;on only, but of nine, the fir&s;t of which was &s;tiled by pre-eminence Archon, and from him the year had its name; the &s;econd, intitled

Ba&s;ileus, took charge of religious ceremonies, and the Polemarc, or third in office, had the conduct of military affairs, whil&s;t all civil and judicial bu&s;ine&s;s was referred to the coun|cil of the remaining &s;ix, called The&s;mothetae. None but pure Athenians of three de&s;cents could be cho&s;en by lot into this council; an oath of office was admini&s;tered to them publicly in the portico of the palace, purporting that they would execute the laws with ju&s;tice and fidelity, and take no gifts either from their clients or the people at large. When they had performed their annual functions, and acquitted them&s;elves without impeachment, they were in cour&s;e ag|gregated to the Areopagites, and held that dig|nity for life. Every thing relating to the care of orphans and widows, or the e&s;tates of minors, was ve&s;ted in the principal magi&s;trate, properly &s;tiled Archon; he had the charge of divorces and the &s;uperintendance of the parents and chil|dren of &s;oldiers, who fell in battle, and of all &s;uch citizens who were maintained at the pub|lic charge.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e annual archons Creon was the fir&s;t, and was elected about the twenty-fourth Olym|piad.</P>

<P>THE Athenian &s;tate continued to be go|verned by annual archons according to the alteration made in its con&s;titution in the twenty-fourth Olympiad, without any thing occurring of importance to merit a recital from the time of Creon to the admini&s;tration of Draco in the thirty-ninth Olympiad. The Athenians, having reduced the monarchical power to the mo&s;t di|minutive of all kingly repre&s;entatives an annual archon, had to all appearance effectually e&s;ta|bli&s;hed their liberties; but it has been the fate of freedom to be turned into abu&s;e in all ages, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people now &s;eemed in more want of reform, than the prerogative of the king had been in the mo&s;t arbitrary times. The moral purity of Draco's manners, and the &s;tern inflexibility of his temper fitted him for an office, that required both rigorous virtue and re&s;olute di&s;patch, for his time was &s;hort and his ta&s;k la|borious and full of danger: Had his power been permanent, it is probable he would have quali|fied the &s;everity of tho&s;e famous laws, which from their &s;anguinary nature were figuratively &s;aid to be written in blood, and it is certain they breathe a &s;pirit calculated rather for the extinc|tion
<PB N="154" REF="160">
of &s;ociety, than for its reformation. We mu&s;t however admit the difficulty of devi&s;ing any code of penal &s;tatutes, by which degrees of puni&s;hment &s;hall be equitably proportioned to degrees of offence. We have no experience or hi&s;tory of any &s;uch code now exi&s;ting, or that ever did exi&s;t. A citizen of the world will not e&s;timate crimes and offences by the &s;ame rule and &s;tandard as a citizen of any one particular community will; local circum&s;tances will give fainter or deeper colourings to crimes according to the peculiar con&s;titution of the &s;tate, again&s;t which they are committed: The Athenians in the time of Draco were governed by annual ma|gi&s;trates, the admini&s;tration of the&s;e magi&s;trates was made &s;ubject to popular enquiry upon its termination; they had expunged from their con|&s;titution the whole&s;ome though high-&s;ounding principle, that a king cannot do wrong; it was now become &s;carce po&s;&s;ible that his &s;ub&s;titute could do right; the people &s;at in judgment on their governors, and many of the mo&s;t virtuous citizens in the &s;tate &s;uffered under their &s;en|tence: Fear re&s;trained the timid from exertion, and the allurements of power debauched the in|tere&s;ted and ambitious from their duty; whil&s;t the magi&s;trate aimed at popularity, the people became intolerably licentious. The rigour of
<PB N="155" REF="161">
Draco impre&s;&s;es us with a high idea of his pu|rity of principle; his abhorrence of the abu&s;es of his predece&s;&s;ors in office, and his indignation again&s;t the depravity of his fellow-citizens em|bittered his mind, and made him rather a mi&s;an|thrope, than a &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>Draco &s;eems to have con&s;idered the commi&s;|&s;ion of crimes, not in proportion to their offence again&s;t &s;ociety, but according to the principle of the criminal, holding a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or equally guil|ty, whether he broke the law in the lea&s;t tittle, or in its greate&s;t extent; for he puni&s;hed indi&s;|criminately with death in both ca&s;es: In this there is as little wi&s;dom as mercy, and it is to the honour of Solon that he revoked &s;uch un|di&s;tingui&s;hing and bloody laws. Ju&s;tly to a&s;cer|tain and define the various degrees of human depravity is impracticable for tho&s;e who cannot &s;earch the human heart; nor in the nature of things is it po&s;&s;ible for any man, or council of men, to form a &s;y&s;tem of puni&s;hments to meet the &s;everal degrees and definitions of crimes with proportioned retribution: Sentence of death is at once the highe&s;t exertion of authority one fellow-creature can exerci&s;e over another and the heavie&s;t atonement any offender can make to the laws of that &s;ociety, in which he is inli&s;t|ed: Draco excu&s;ed him&s;elf from the charge of
<PB N="156" REF="162">
indi&s;criminate rigour by pleading that he could devi&s;e no puni&s;hment greater than death; the nature of the plea gives an in&s;ight into the cha|racter of the man, that needs no comment; it is plain however that he had no idea of aggravating death by tortures; he did not know, or would not practi&s;e, tho&s;e dete&s;table arts and refinements, which now prevail in too many parts of the Chri&s;|tian world, of extorting criminations and confe&s;|&s;ions by heightening the agonies of death. The &s;hort duration of his authority, as I before ob&s;erv|ed, precipitated him upon this &s;y&s;tem of &s;everity, which time and reflection would probably have corrected: A ha&s;ty reformer is equally to be dreaded with a deliberate tyrant; legal cruelty is of all mo&s;t terrible; a law once made is made to be executed; the will of the judge cannot mitigate it, and the power of the &s;overeign can only relea&s;e from puni&s;hment, but not apportion or modify it: Herein con&s;i&s;ts the irreparable defect of all e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of fixed puni&s;h|ment; to include different degrees of criminality under one and the &s;ame degree of penalty is not &s;trict equity, but to live without laws at the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of any human tribunal is &s;lavery of the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;ort.</P>
<P>By Draco's laws an Athenian was equally guilty of death, whether he pilfered a cabbage or
<PB N="157" REF="163">
murdered a citizen: Horrible decree! If the principle of puni&s;hment does not con&s;i&s;t in re|venging what is pa&s;t, but in preventing the cul|prit from repeating and the community from &s;uffering the like or any other offence from the &s;ame per&s;on, it may well be doubted if death need be inflicted in any ca&s;e; the terror of ex|ample, not the &s;pirit of revenge, mu&s;t con&s;titute the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a mode of puni&s;hment, if any nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ts; but if puni&s;hments may be devi&s;ed, by which guilty per&s;ons &s;hall be made to atone to &s;ociety without cutting them from it, and if the&s;e puni&s;hments may be &s;uch as &s;hall deter and terrify the evil-minded equally with death it&s;elf, policy, independent of religion, will be intere&s;ted to adopt them.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected that the Athenians would be remedied by &s;uch &s;anguinary laws as the&s;e of Draco, and they had been in operation nearly half a century, when Solon in the third year of the forty-&s;ixth Olympiad found the peo|ple in as much need of reformation, as Draco did in the beginning of the thirty-fifth Olym|piad.</P>
<P>Solon was of noble birth and of an elevated &s;oul; he was a friend to liberty, but a lover of order; de&s;cended from Codrus, he was a patriot by inheritance; though he was a great adept in
<PB N="158" REF="164">
the philo&s;ophy of the times, it neither &s;oured his manners nor left him without attention to the public: When he withdrew him&s;elf from the world for the purpo&s;es of &s;tudy and contempla|tion, it was to render him&s;elf a more u&s;eful citi|zen on his return to &s;ociety: With a fortune rather below mediocrity he had &s;uch a &s;pirit of beneficence and genero&s;ity, that he was obliged in his youth to apply him&s;elf to commerce to &s;upport his independence: Solon's philo&s;ophy did not boa&s;t any unnatural contempt of pain or plea&s;ure; he affected no apathy; on the contrary, when he was reproached for weeping at the death of his &s;on, as if it was unbecoming of a wi&s;e man to bewail an evil he could not reme|dy, he an&s;wered with a mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of his weakne&s;s, that it was on that very account he did bewail it.</P>
<P>The anecdote Plutarch gives us of Solon's in|terview with his contemporary Thales, and the &s;illy method that philo&s;opher took for convincing Solon of the advantages of celibacy by employ|ing a fellow to make a fal&s;e report to him of his &s;on's death, heightens our affection for the man, without lowering our re&s;pect for the &s;age: Thales in the true &s;pirit of &s;ophi&s;m triumphed in the &s;uperiority of his wi&s;dom by avoiding tho&s;e connections, which &s;often the human heart, and
<PB N="159" REF="165">
vainly &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;unk the dignity of Solon's character by expo&s;ing to ridicule the tender feelings of the father.</P>
<P>The Athenians were exhau&s;ted by a tedious and unpro&s;perous war with the people of Me|gara; the important i&s;land of Salamis was lo&s;t, and &s;uch was their de&s;pair of ever recovering it, that they pa&s;&s;ed a law for making it a capital offence in any citizen to propo&s;e the retaking it; Solon, who regarded this degrading edict with hone&s;t indignation, feigned him&s;elf in&s;ane and ru&s;hing into the forum harangued the po|pulace, abrogated the edict and declared war again&s;t the Megaren&s;ians: On this occa&s;ion he addre&s;&s;ed the people in elegiac ver&s;es of his own compo&s;ing, one hundred in number; the power of his mu&s;e prevailed, for it was great; the people gave him the command of an expedi|tion again&s;t Salamis, in which he had the good fortune to reduce that i&s;land and re-annex it to his country, which had made &s;uch public avowal of its de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Solon is &s;o highly celebrated as a poet, that &s;ome ancient authorities have equalled him to He&s;iod and even to Homer: We have few and &s;mall remains, but many te&s;timonies of his wri|tings; in particular we are informed, that he compo&s;ed five thou&s;and ver&s;es on the common|wealth
<PB N="160" REF="166">
of Athens, recording the tran&s;actions of his own time, not as a hi&s;tory in prai&s;e, but in defence of him&s;elf, and with the view to encou|rage his countrymen to per&s;i&s;t in a cour&s;e of public virtue and private morality. He wrote iambics al&s;o and odes, and compo&s;ed even his laws in ver&s;e, of which Plutarch has quoted the exordium.</P>
<P>He employed &s;tratagem in the reduction of the i&s;land of Salamis, but as the celebrated Pi&s;i|&s;tratus was joined with him in this enterprize, it mu&s;t not be di&s;gui&s;ed that &s;ome authorities give the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition to Pi&s;i&s;tratus; both were men of con&s;ummate addre&s;s and re|&s;ource, and each no doubt had his &s;hare of merit in the &s;ervice; the reputation Solon gained by this event was &s;till increa&s;ed by his conduct in the defence of the famous temple of Delphi again&s;t the &s;acrilegious Cirrhaeans; though he was only a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the general Cli&s;thenes the Sicyonian in this campaign, the &s;ucce&s;sful ter|mination of the war by the capture of Cirrha was univer&s;ally attributed to Solon.</P>
<P>Athens was now rent by popular feuds and di&s;&s;en&s;ions; the commonwealth was in imminent peril, every thing tending to civil tumult and confu&s;ion, and the people in a &s;tate little &s;hort of ab&s;olute anarchy: In this extremity every
<PB N="161" REF="167">
eye was turned towards Solon and he was elect|ed archon by the general voice of his fellow|citizens. It was now not only in his power to make him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the &s;tate, and to e&s;tabli&s;h that tyranny in his own per&s;on, which he lived to &s;ee Pi&s;i&s;tratus a&s;pire to and obtain, but that &s;tep was al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed upon him by the unanimous &s;olicitation of his friends and the public at large; religion had its &s;hare in the temptation, for the temple of Delphi uttered its oracular decree for his a&s;&s;uming the &s;upreme power in Athens, and when he with&s;tood the dazzling offer he had to combat the reproaches and invectives of all parties for refu&s;ing it. A magnanimity that was proof again&s;t temptation was not to be &s;haken by calumny; &s;upported by con&s;cious integrity he oppo&s;ed the torrent, and contenting him&s;elf with the limited authority of an annual magi&s;tracy, framed and publi&s;hed tho&s;e mild and &s;alutary ordinances, which have en|deared his name to all po&s;terity. Among&s;t the pacifying mea&s;ures of his government he found it expedient to relieve the people by an ordinance for the remi&s;&s;ion of debts of a certain de&s;cription; this act rai&s;ed a &s;torm of oppo&s;ition and abu&s;e from all the rich and u&s;urious again&s;t his admi|ni&s;tration, and &s;ome who had been his intimates took part in the faction, and began to per&s;ecute
<PB N="162" REF="168">
him in the bittere&s;t manner, charging him with the meanne&s;s of exempting him&s;elf as a creditor from the conditions of the act; he &s;oon turned the odium of the charge upon the contrivers of it by giving public proof to the city that he him&s;elf had been the fir&s;t, who obeyed his own law, and remitted a con&s;iderable &s;um to his debtors; this proof of his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as a creditor convinced his countrymen of his up|rightne&s;s as a legi&s;lator, and he ro&s;e the higher in their e&s;teem for the malevolent attack he had &s;o fully repul&s;ed: Rea&s;on and public gratitude at length prevailed, and the voice of faction be|ing put to &s;ilence, the whole care of the com|monwealth was &s;urrendered into his hands to be regulated and reformed according to his wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Solon, though too magnanimous to accept the title of king, was too good a citizen to de|cline the tru&s;t, and now it was that he abrogated all Draco's &s;anguinary laws, except tho&s;e that affected murderers: This, as I before ob&s;erved, occurred in the cour&s;e of the forty-&s;ixth Olym|piad; he arranged the people into four cla&s;&s;es ac|cording to the different proportions of their pro|perty; he erected the principal council of the Areopagites with inferior courts for the admini|&s;tration of law and ju&s;tice, and publi&s;hed his fa|mous

manife&s;to for rendering infamous all per|&s;ons, who in civil &s;editions &s;hould remain &s;pecta|tors of their country's danger by a criminal neu|trality; he enacted many whole&s;ome regulations re&s;pecting marriages, tending to the encrea&s;e of population; he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed libels, and made idle|ne&s;s puni&s;hable by law; he put under certain di&s;abilities parents, who were convicted of hav|ing gro&s;ly neglected the education of their fa|milies, and re&s;trained by &s;umptuary laws every &s;pecies of public exce&s;s. Many more of his laws might be enumerated, if it were nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon facts &s;o generally known, but it will &s;uffice to mention, that when he had com|pleated his code, he bound the &s;enators to the ob&s;ervance of what it contained by the &s;olemne&s;t oath he could devi&s;e, and cau&s;ing his laws to be engraven on tables of wood, hung them up in the public courts that no man might plead ig|norance.</P>
<P>The nature of this oath is curious; the &s;ena|tor was led up to a ponderous &s;tone pre&s;erved in the forum; there the oath was publicly ad|mini&s;tered, and the obligation of it was, that he &s;hould dedicate a piece of gold to the temple of Delphi of equal weight with the &s;tone if he was proved guilty of having violated his oath: Not content with thus &s;wearing the judges and &s;ena|tors

to the faithful admini&s;tration of his laws, he al&s;o bound the people by oath to their due ob|&s;ervance, and having done all this with a tem|per and prudence, particularly expre&s;&s;ive of his character, Solon took his leave of Athens and &s;at out upon his travels into Egypt.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH the wi&s;dom and magna|nimity of Solon are con&s;picuous in every action of his life, which hi&s;tory has tran&s;mitted to us, nothing is more worthy of our admiration and prai&s;e than the circum&s;tance la&s;t recorded of his &s;ece&s;&s;ion from Athens.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to follow him in his travels, in which after &s;ome time &s;pent in vi&s;iting Egypt, Cyprus, and Lydia, he obeyed the &s;ummons of his fellow-citizens and returned to Athens: That city during his ab&s;ence had been di&s;tracted by furious and contending factions: Lycurgus headed one party, Megacles &s;on of Alcmaeon another, and Pi&s;i&s;tratus was leader of a third, in which was included nearly the whole inferior or|der of the people: All the&s;e parties neverthele&s;s pre&s;erved a re&s;pect for their ancient benefactor
<PB N="165" REF="171">
and lawgiver, and he &s;pared no pains in return to a&s;&s;uage and compo&s;e the di&s;orders of the &s;tate, but in vain; age indeed had not yet deprived him of his mental faculties, but his corporeal ones were debilitated, and the cri&s;is called for more activity than he was now capable of exerting; he could no longer &s;peak in public nor addre&s;s the people in the forum, as he was accu&s;tomed to do; he tried his influence &s;eparately and in pri|vate with the leaders of the &s;everal factions: Pi|&s;i&s;tratus, who&s;e manners were of the gentle&s;t kind, affected to receive the advice and coun&s;els of Solon with great external re&s;pect, but ambi|tion had taken too firm hold of his heart and he had laid his plans too deep to be diverted from them by the patriotic di&s;cour&s;es of this venerable citizen; the &s;agacity of Solon penetrated his de|&s;igns, and when he was convinced of his di&s;&s;imu|lation, and &s;aw the liberties of his country on the point of being overthrown by this artful dae|magogue, he came into open court in military array, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the a&s;&s;embly ready to head the friends of their country, and expel Pi&s;i&s;tratus by force of arms: The noble effort was too late, for the &s;pirit of the people was lo&s;t, and all men &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to &s;urrender them|&s;elves without re&s;i&s;tance to the u&s;urper. Solon, finding that he could not rou&s;e them to a con&s;i|deration
<PB N="166" REF="172">
of their ancient dignity, nor in&s;pire them with a becoming &s;en&s;e of the value of li|berty, laid a&s;ide his arms, and &s;u&s;pending them at the door of the Court-hou&s;e, took a &s;hort but pathetic leave of Athens, and once again retired into voluntary bani&s;hment: Whither is not di|&s;tinctly a&s;certained; many pre&s;&s;ing invitations were addre&s;&s;ed to him from different parts, and I am inclined to think he accepted that of Croe|&s;us king of Lydia, and that he clo&s;ed an illu&s;tri|ous life in extreme old age in the i&s;land of Cy|prus. His a&s;hes by his expre&s;s direction were tran&s;ported to his native i&s;land of Salamis and there depo&s;ited. The Athenians erected his &s;ta|tue in bra&s;s, but Pi&s;i&s;tratus revoked his laws: The laws of Draco, notwith&s;tanding their &s;eve|rity, were in execution for a longer period than the mild and prudent ordinances of Solon. The people it is true never wholly forfeited their re|&s;pect for this excellent per&s;on, but they were un|worthy of him; even Pi&s;i&s;tratus amid&s;t the &s;trug|gles of ambition offered no in&s;ult to his per&s;on, and every country, which his fame had reached, pre&s;ented an a&s;ylum to the venerable exile.</P>
<P>As an orator Solon &s;tands high in point of merit, and fir&s;t in order of time: As a poet, his genius was &s;ublime, various, and fluent; in &s;ub|jects of fiction and fancy he never dealt; but,
<PB N="167" REF="173">
though he cho&s;e his topics with the gravity of a &s;tate&s;man, and handled them with the fidelity of an hi&s;torian, he compo&s;ed with ardour, and never failed to fire his hearers with the recitation of his poems: He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have reprobated the drama, but, if this be a fact, we may well conclude, that it was the old corrupt ma&s;que of Bacchus and the Satyrs, of which he &s;ignified his di&s;like, and in this he is warranted. In two ex|peditions, where he had a military command, he was eminently &s;ucce&s;sful, and gained a high de|gree of glory: No &s;tate&s;man ever &s;tood in times more perilous, no citizen ever re&s;i&s;ted more al|luring offers of ambition, and no legi&s;lator ever regulated a more di&s;orderly community: Tho' devoted to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and a great ma&s;ter in the early &s;cience of the times, he mix|ed with chearfulne&s;s in &s;ociety, was friendly and convivial, and did not hold back from tho&s;e ten|der ties and attachments, which connect a man to the world, and which by &s;ome have been con|&s;idered incompatible with a life devoted to wi&s;|dom and &s;ublime philo&s;ophy: Strict in his morals as Draco, he was not like him di&s;po&s;ed to put criminals to death, whil&s;t there was any hope of conducting them by gentle mea&s;ures to repent|ance: His mode&s;ty was natural and unaffected, and though he was generally &s;ilent in company,
<PB N="168" REF="174">
his &s;ilence threw no damp upon fe&s;tivity, for it did not &s;avour of &s;ullenne&s;s, and he was known to be a friend to the u&s;e of wine with freedom, but without exce&s;s: At the meeting of the &s;even celebrated &s;ages (his contemporaries and col|leagues in wi&s;dom) when they were entertained by Periander at Corinth, the golden &s;alver, which the Mile&s;ian fi&s;hermen had dragged out of the &s;ea in their net, and which the Delphic oracle upon reference of the controver&s;y had decreed to the wi&s;e&s;t man of the age, was by general &s;uffrage given to Solon; each per&s;on, with becoming de|ference to the others, had &s;everally declined the prize, but Solon was at length con&s;trained to re|ceive it by concurrent vote of the whole a&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians are not agreed upon the exact time of Solon's departure from Athens, and &s;ome maintain that he continued there till his death; this is not probable; but the re&s;ult of the ac|counts puts it out of doubt that he remained there, whil&s;t there was any hope of compo&s;ing the di&s;turbances of the &s;tate, and of re&s;toring its tranquillity and freedom under the prudent re|gulations he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, when he was Ar|chon.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner had this excellent citizen turn|ed his back upon Athens, than all the&s;e hopes
<PB N="169" REF="175">
peri&s;hed and univer&s;al de&s;pair took place; the degeneracy of the people became incurable, and no one was found with authority or zeal to op|po&s;e the approaching revolution: Though Solon was far in the decline of life, yet if there had been any public virtue &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, the liberty of Athens had not been lo&s;t without a &s;truggle; but, although neutrality in civil commotions had been declared infamous and criminal by the laws of Solon, the populace through de&s;pair or indo|lence declined the conte&s;t and held them&s;elves in readine&s;s to receive a ma&s;ter in either of the contending parti&s;ans, who &s;hould prevail over his competitors.</P>
<P>Fortune and &s;uperior addre&s;s at length decided the prize of ambition to Pi&s;i&s;tratus and his party, for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every qualification that could re|commend him to the public; of in&s;inuating man|ners, with a beautiful and commanding per&s;on, he was gallant, eloquent, and munificent; no man acquitted him&s;elf more gracefully as a public &s;peaker, and when Pericles in aftertimes alarmed the jealou&s;y of the Athenians, the re&s;emblance he bore to Pi&s;i&s;tratus in eloquence as well as in features was &s;o &s;triking, that he was univer&s;ally called the <HI>Second Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> and the comic poets in their &s;atirical allu&s;ions exhibited him on the &s;tage by that name and character.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176">Whil&s;t the&s;e party &s;truggles were in &s;u&s;pence, Pi&s;i&s;tratus u&s;ed an artifice for recommending him&s;elf to the people, which was deci&s;ive in his favour: One day on a &s;udden he ru&s;hed into the forum, where the citizens were a&s;&s;embled, as if he had been flying from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who were in pur&s;uit of him, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to public view defaced with wounds, and covered with blood; he was mounted in his chariot, and the mules that drew him were &s;treaming with blood as well as him&s;elf: The crowd flocked around him, and in this &s;ituation without wiping his wounds or di&s;mounting from his chariot, he ha|rangued the forum; he told them he had that in&s;tant e&s;caped from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating &s;words of the nobles, who had cruelly attempted to de&s;troy the man of the people for his activity in oppo&s;ing the exactions of &s;ordid creditors and u&s;urious tyrants: His tears, his &s;ufferings, the beauty of his per&s;on now &s;treaming with blood, which he had &s;pilt in their cau&s;e, his military &s;ervices at Megara, and his prote&s;tations of affection to the people, in who&s;e defence he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted a determination to per&s;i&s;t or peri&s;h, all together formed &s;uch an addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions, and pre|&s;ented &s;uch a picture to the eye, that were irre|&s;i&s;tibly affecting.</P>
<P>Though it &s;oon appeared in proof, that the
<PB N="171" REF="177">
whole was artifice, and that all the&s;e wounds about him&s;elf and his mules were of his own giving for the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment, &s;till the moment &s;erved his purpo&s;e, and in the heat of popular tumult he obtained a decree for grant|ing him a body-guard, not armed as &s;oldiers, but with &s;ticks and clubs: At the head of this de&s;perate rabble he lo&s;t no time in forcing his way into the citadel, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it and the commonwealth in the &s;ame moment: He next proceeded to exile the mo&s;t powerful and obnoxious of his opponents. Megacles and Ly|curgus with their immediate adherents either fled from the city or were forcibly driven out of it; the revolution was compleat.</P>
<P>The tumult having &s;ub&s;ided, Pi&s;i&s;tratus began to look around him, and to take his mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring him&s;elf in the authority he had &s;eized: For this purpo&s;e he augmented his body-guard, which, as they were fir&s;t voted to him, con&s;i&s;ted only of fifty; the&s;e he endeavoured to attach to his per&s;on by liberal payments, and whil&s;t he equipt them at all points like &s;oldiers, he put a cunning &s;tratagem in practice by which he con|trived to &s;eize all the private arms of the citizens and totally di&s;mantled Athens: He u&s;ed le&s;s ce|remony with the nobles, for he &s;tripped them of all weapons of offence openly and by force; and
<PB N="172" REF="178">
now he found him&s;elf, as he believed, in &s;afe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeign power and throne of Athens.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ed in the fifty-fir&s;t Olympiad, when Comias was archon.</P>
<P>It rarely happens that dominion, rapidly ob|tained, proves firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The factions of Megacles and Lycurgus were broken by this revolution, but not extingui&s;hed, and Pi&s;i&s;tratus either could not prevent their re-uniting, or per|haps over-&s;ecurity made him inattentive to their movements: He enjoyed his power for a &s;hort time, and was in his turn driven out of Athens by tho&s;e he had exiled, and his effects were put up to public &s;ale, as the property of an out|law.</P>
<P>Megacles and Lycurgus now divided the go|vernment between them; this was a &s;y&s;tem that &s;oon wrought its own overthrow; and Megacles, finding his party the weaker, invited Pi&s;i&s;tratus to return to Athens, vainly imagining he could lull his ambition and &s;ecure him to his intere&s;t by giv|ing him his daughter Cae&s;yra in marriage. Pi&s;i|&s;tratus accepted the terms, and obeyed the wel|come recal, but it was in &s;uch a manner, as might have put the weake&s;t man upon his guard, for his return and entrance into Athens were accompa|nied by one of the mo&s;t barefaced attacks upon
<PB N="173" REF="179">
public credulity and &s;uper&s;tition, that is to be found in the hi&s;tory of man.</P>
<P>He had already &s;ucceeded in &s;everal hardy &s;tratagems, and all had been di&s;covered after they had &s;erved his purpo&s;es. His pretended a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination, his contrivances for arming his body|guard and for di&s;arming the citizens at large, were all well known to the people, &s;o that he mu&s;t have taken a very nice mea&s;ure of their folly and blindne&s;s, when upon his entering the city he undertook to bring in his train a woman, named Phaea, whom he dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of the godde&s;s Minerva, and impo&s;ed her on the vulgar for their tutelar deity in per&s;on: He had in&s;tructed her how to addre&s;s the people in his behalf, commanding them to rein&s;tate him in his power, and open the gates of the citadel at his approach: The lady was &s;ufficiently per&s;onable for the character &s;he a&s;&s;umed, and, as a proof of her divinity, was of colo&s;&s;al &s;tature: Extravagant as the experiment may &s;eem, it &s;ucceeded in all points; the human deity was obeyed, and the ingenious demagogue carried all before him: This Grecian Joan of Arc received the adora|tion of the &s;uper&s;titious vulgar in public, and the grateful care&s;&s;es of the exulting tyrant in private: The lady was not of very di&s;tingui&s;hed birth and fortune, for before &s;he took upon her the cha|racter

of a godde&s;s &s;he conde&s;cended to the mor|tal occupation of a flower-girl, and made gar|lands after the cu&s;tom of the Greeks for fea&s;ts and merry-makings: Pi&s;i&s;tratus rewarded her liberally by giving her in marriage to his &s;on Hipparchus; a commodious re&s;ource for di&s;|po&s;ing of a ca&s;t-off godde&s;s; as for him&s;elf, he was engaged to Cae&s;yra: Phaea's marriage with Hipparchus &s;oon convinced the world that &s;he was a mortal, but Pi&s;i&s;tratus gave him&s;elf no concern to prevent the di&s;covery; in proce&s;s of time it came to pa&s;s, upon Pi&s;i&s;tratus's &s;econd expul&s;ion, that Phaea was publicly impeached and condemned upon the charge of <HI>lae&s;ae Maje&s;tatis.</HI></P>

<P>PISISTRATUS had been five years in exile, when Megacles brought about his recal, and vainly thought to fix him in his inte|re&s;t by giving him his daughter Cae&s;yra in mar|riage; &s;uch alliances rarely an&s;wer the political ends for which they are made: Pi&s;i&s;tratus had &s;everal &s;ons by his fir&s;t wife, and having re-e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the tyranny after the man|ner

we have been de&s;cribing, and be&s;towed his favorite Phaea upon his &s;on Hipparchus, he took the daughter of Megacles as the condition of his contract with her father, but with a fixed deter|mination again&s;t a &s;econd family, who&s;e preten|&s;ions might come in competition with tho&s;e of his children by his fir&s;t marriage, in who&s;e favour he wi&s;hed to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who both by age and capacity were fit for government, whenever it &s;hould devolve upon them.</P>
<P>Cae&s;yra put up with her hu&s;band's neglect for &s;ome time, but at length &s;he imparted her di&s;gu&s;t to her mother, and &s;he of cour&s;e communicated it to Megacles. Ju&s;tly offended by the indignity of &s;uch treatment, Megacles immediately took his mea&s;ures with the enemies of his &s;on-in-law for his &s;econd expul&s;ion, prudently di&s;gui&s;ing his re&s;entment, till he was in a condition to put it in force: It did not long e&s;cape the penetration of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, but when he came to the know|ledge of the con&s;piracy that had been formed again&s;t his power, he found him&s;elf and party too weak to oppo&s;e it, and &s;eizing the hour of &s;afety, made a voluntary abdication by retiring into Eretria without a &s;truggle and in the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>

el&s;e the time did not allow them to follow it by any active mea&s;ures for preventing his return: Eleven years however pa&s;&s;ed and &s;till he remain|ed an exile from Athens; old as he was, his am|bition does not &s;eem to have cooled, nor was he idle in the interim; he had an interview with his &s;ons in Eretria and concerted mea&s;ures with them for his re&s;toration; he formed alliances with &s;e|veral of the Grecian cities, particularly Thebes and Argos, and obtained a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply of money, with which he enli&s;ted and took into his pay a con&s;iderable army of mercenaries, and be|gan ho&s;tilities in the Athenian &s;tate by &s;eizing upon Marathon. This &s;ucce&s;sful mea&s;ure drew out many of his &s;ecret parti&s;ans from Athens to join him in this place, where the promi&s;ing a&s;pect of his affairs and the popularity of his character had induced great numbers to re&s;ort to his &s;tan|dard: Thus reinforced he put his army in mo|tion and directed his march towards the city. The ruling party at Athens ha&s;tily collected troops to oppo&s;e his approach and put them un|der the command of Leogaras, who no &s;ooner took the field again&s;t Pi&s;i&s;tratus, than he &s;uffered him&s;elf and army to be &s;urprized by that experi|enced general and fled in di&s;order over the coun|try; the politic conqueror &s;topped the pur&s;uit and di&s;patched his &s;ons after the fugitives to a&s;|&s;ure

them of pardon and protection, if they would go back to their homes and re&s;ume their occu|pations in peace like good citizens: Pi&s;i&s;tratus was far advanced in age, and having carried this deci&s;ive action by &s;tratagem, took every prudent precaution for e&s;tabli&s;hing his advantage by &s;eiz|ing the &s;ons of the leading parti&s;ans in oppo&s;i|tion to his government, and detaining them in clo&s;e cu&s;tody as ho&s;tages for the peaceable be|haviour of their parents. He conducted him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion with &s;o much temper and judg|ment, the &s;plendor of his talents and the elegance of his manners reflected &s;o much lu&s;tre on his court and country, that his u&s;urpation was either no longer remembered, or remembered without aver&s;ion and regret; in &s;hort, his genius for go|vernment was &s;uch that no man que&s;tioned his right: Even Solon, with all his zeal for liberty, pronounced of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, that Athens would not have contained a more virtuous citizen, had his ambition been directed to a more ju&s;tifiable pur|&s;uit: He was mild and merciful in the extreme, winning in addre&s;s, an eloquent orator, a ju&s;t judge, and a munificent &s;overeign; in a word, he had either the merit of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or the art of di&s;&s;embling, every good quality and every brilliant accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Having now brought down this brief recapi|tulation
<PB N="178" REF="184">
of the Athenian hi&s;tory to the la&s;t period of the reign of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, we are arrived at the point of time, in which that remarkable aera commences, which I call <HI>The Literary age of Greece:</HI> It was now that Pi&s;i&s;tratus con|ceived the enlarged and liberal idea of in&s;ti|tuting the fir&s;t public library in Greece, and of laying it open to the in&s;pection and re&s;ort of the learned and curious throughout the kingdoms and provinces of that part of the world&mdash;<HI>Libros Athenis di&s;ciplinarum liberalium publice ad legen|dum praebendos primus po&s;ui&s;&s;e dicitur Pi&s;i&s;tratus tyrannus.</HI> (Aul. Gell. cap. xvii. lib. vi.)&mdash;Thro' a long, though interrupted, reign of three and thirty years he had approved him&s;elf a great en|courager of literature and a very diligent col|lector of the works of learned men: The com|piler of the &s;cattered rhap&s;odies of Homer, and the familiar friend of the great epic poet Orpheus of Croton (author of the Argonautics) he was him&s;elf accompli&s;hed in the learning of the age he lived in; and, whil&s;t his court became a place of re&s;ort for contemporary genius, he pu&s;hed his re&s;earches after the remains of the ancient poets and philo&s;ophers through every &s;pot, where the liberal &s;ciences had been known to flouri&s;h; col|lecting books in Ionia, Sicily, and throughout all the provinces of Greece with much co&s;t and
<PB N="179" REF="185">
diligence; and having at length compleated his purpo&s;e and endowed a library with the trea&s;ures of the time, he laid it open to all readers for the edification of mankind&mdash;<HI>Who of tho&s;e times &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed him in learning</HI> (&s;ays Cicero) <HI>or what orator was more eloquent or accompli&s;hed than Pi&s;i&s;tratus, who fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed the works of Homer in that order of compilation we have them at this very time?</HI> (<HI>De Orat.</HI> iii.137.)</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of this library forms a &s;ignal epoch in the annals of literature, for from this period Attica took the lead of all the provinces of Greece in arts and &s;ciences, and Athens henceforward became the &s;chool of philo&s;ophers, the theatre of poets, and the capital of ta&s;te and elegance, acknowledged to a proverb throughout the world. From this period to the death of Menander the comic poet an illu&s;trious &s;cene pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our ob&s;ervation. Greece, with unbounded fertility of genius, &s;ent a flood of compo&s;itions into light, of which, although few entire &s;pecimens have de&s;cended to po&s;terity, yet the&s;e with &s;ome fragments, and what may be further collected on the &s;ubject from the records of the &s;cholia&s;ts and grammarians, afford abundant matter for literary di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is painful in the extreme to reflect upon the ravages of time, and to call to mind the ho&s;t of
<PB N="180" REF="186">

<P>Pi&s;i&s;tratus, as we have ob&s;erved, e&s;tabli&s;hed the fir&s;t public library in Greece; Xerxes plun|dered Athens of this collection much augmented by the literary munificence of Hipparchus and the &s;ucceeding archons: Xerxes was not, like the barbarians of the lower ages, in&s;en&s;ible to the trea&s;ure he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of; on the con|trary, he regarded the&s;e volumes as the mo&s;t &s;olid fruits of his expedition and imported them into Per&s;ia, as &s;plendid trophies of his triumph on his return. Seleucus, &s;irnamed Nicanor, after|wards re&s;tored this library to Athens with a princely magnanimity. The kings of Pergamus al&s;o became great collectors, and the Pergamaean

library grew into much reputation and re&s;ort. But of all the libraries of antiquity that collected at Alexandria by the Ptolemies of Egypt was much the mo&s;t re&s;pectable. Athenaeus &s;ays (p. 3.) that Ptolemy Philadelphus purcha&s;ed the Perga|maean library, and in particular the books col|lected by Nileus, principally con&s;i&s;ting of the Greek dramati&s;ts, which with what he got at Athens and Rhodes, furni&s;hed the great library at Alexandria with forty thou&s;and volumes. This library was unhappily &s;et on fire, when Julius Cae&s;ar found it nece&s;&s;ary to burn his &s;hips in the docks at Alexandria; &s;o Plutarch &s;tates the ca&s;e; but Aulus Gellius &s;ays they were &s;et on fire accidentally by the auxiliary troops&mdash;<HI>non &s;ponte, neque opera con&s;ulta, &s;ed a militibus forte auxiliariis incen&s;a &s;unt.</HI>&mdash;This misfortune was in a great mea&s;ure repaired by the library which Marc Antony pre&s;ented to Cleopatra, and by &s;ub&s;equent additions was encrea&s;ed to &s;uch an amount, that when it was at la&s;t irretrievably de&s;troyed by the Caliph Omar, it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even hundred thou&s;and volumes.</P>
<P>This amazing repo&s;itory of ancient &s;cience was buried in a&s;hes by the well-known quib|bling edict of that barbarous fanatic&mdash;<HI>If,</HI> &s;aid the Caliph, <HI>the&s;e volumes contain doctrines con|formable to the Koran, then is the Koran alone</HI>

In vain did the philo&s;opher John of Alexandria intercede to &s;ave them; univer&s;al condemnation to the flames was the &s;entence ignorance denounced again&s;t the&s;e literary martyrs. The flow of wit, the flights of fancy, and the labours of learning alike contributed to feed the fires of tho&s;e baths, in which the &s;avage conquerors recreated them|&s;elves after the toils of the &s;iege. Need we en|quire when art and &s;cience were extinct, if dark|ne&s;s over&s;pread the nations? It is a period too melancholy to reflect upon and too vacant to record: Hi&s;tory pa&s;&s;es over it, as over the chart of an ocean without a &s;hore, with this cutting recollection accompanying it, that in this ocean are buried many of the brighte&s;t monuments of ancient genius.</P>

<P>AT the &s;ame time that it is fair to &s;uppo&s;e there mu&s;t be more than ordinary merit in men, who ri&s;e to great opulence and condi|tion in life from low beginnings, all the world mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the danger attending &s;udden elevation, and how very apt a man's head is to turn, who climbs an eminence, to which his habits have not familiarized him. A mountaineer can tread firm upon a precipice and walk erect without tottering along the path, that winds it&s;elf about the craggy cliff, on which he has his dwelling; whil&s;t the inhabitant of the valley travels with affright and danger over the giddy pa&s;s, and oftentimes is precipitated from the heighth to peri&s;h in the gulph beneath his feet. Such is the fate of many, who by the revolutions of fortune are rai&s;ed to lofty &s;ituations: It is ge|nerally the lot of &s;uch people to make few friends; in their danger there are none to give them warn|ing,
<PB N="185" REF="191">
in their fall there are few to afford them pity.</P>
<P>This is not the ca&s;e with them, who are born to the dignities they enjoy; the &s;overeign, who&s;e throne is his inheritance, meets with pity and in|dulgence; pity for the cares in&s;eparable from his condition, indulgence for the failings and exce&s;&s;es incidental to hereditary greatne&s;s; but the man, who is the maker of his own fortune, acts on a &s;tage, where every &s;tep he takes will be ob&s;erved with jealou&s;y; among&s;t the many thou&s;ands, who are &s;et to watch him, let him reflect how many hearts there are, rankling with di&s;appointed pride, and envying him the lot, which in their own conceit at lea&s;t their merit had a better title to: When &s;uch a man appears, it is the common cry&mdash;<HI>I cannot bear that up&s;tart.</HI>&mdash;At the &s;ame time therefore that it mu&s;t be allowed more na|tural to excu&s;e the proud looks of the high, than the proud looks of the low, &s;till it is no bad cau|tion to beware of giving ea&s;y faith to reports again&s;t tho&s;e, whom &s;o many un&s;ucce&s;sful people are intere&s;ted to decry; for though fortune can do mighty things among&s;t us, and make great men in this world, &s;he cannot make friends.</P>
<P>If caution be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch as are only lookers on upon the&s;e &s;udden changes in the &s;cene of life, how much more wary &s;hould he be,

who by fortune's favour is the actor in it! Time pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;o abounds in examples to put him on his guard, that if he will not profit by example, what hope is there that precept will avail? That any man &s;hould grow arrogant, who has once been dependant, is as unaccountable for the folly of the thing, as it is for the ba&s;ene&s;s of it; it is as if a pedagogue &s;hould turn tyrant, becau&s;e he remembers to have &s;marted under the la&s;h of the ma&s;ter when a &s;chool-boy: And yet there &s;eems a principle in &s;ome natures, that in|clines them to this de&s;picable &s;pecies of revenge, by which they &s;acrifice all claim to rea&s;on, repu|tation, or religion. Diony&s;ius, though the cru|elle&s;t of all tyrants, had moderation in a private &s;tation and made a good and patient &s;choolma&s;ter; he handled the &s;ceptre like a rod, and the rod as he &s;hould have done a &s;ceptre. Are we to con|clude from this and other in&s;tances, that hu|manity may be learnt, by tho&s;e who de&s;cend from power, but that men become tyrants by a&s;cend|ing to it?</P>
<P>Is there in nature any thing &s;o ridiculous as pride, &s;o &s;elf-de&s;tructive, &s;o ab&s;urd? The man, who ri&s;es out of humble life, mu&s;t have &s;een it, felt it, and remarked its folly; he mu&s;t have been convinced that pride deprives it&s;elf of its own proper object; for every proud man, who a&s;&s;umes

And yet it happens every day. What is &s;o hateful to a poor man as the pur&s;e-proud arrogance of a rich one? Let fortune &s;hift the &s;cene and make the poor man rich, he runs at once into the vice, that he declaimed again&s;t &s;o feelingly: The&s;e are &s;trange contradictions in the human character. One &s;hould have thought that Pope Sixtus V. might have recollected him&s;elf enough to be hum|ble, though Pa&s;quin had never reminded him of it; but neither he, nor Becket, nor Wol&s;ey, had any moderation in their &s;pirit, though profe&s;&s;ing a religion, who&s;e very e&s;&s;ence is humility.</P>

As the&s;e disfranchi&s;ed matrons or ex-wives keep the be&s;t company, and make the be&s;t figures in all fa&s;hionable cir|cles, a &s;cholar may receive in&s;truction without &s;lander, and pro&s;titute her honour without ri&s;que|ing her reputation; a hu&s;band mu&s;t be a brute indeed, who can object to this &s;ociety, and a wife mu&s;t be a fool indeed, who does not profit by it; when a new-married woman receives the&s;e pri|vileged ladies in her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;ees at once the folly of being virtuous, for they are the merrie&s;t, the loude&s;t, the be&s;t followed, and the mo&s;t ad|mired of all their &s;ex; they never di&s;grace their characters by a pu&s;illanimous repentance, they never baulk their plea&s;ures by a &s;tupid reforma|tion, but keep it up with &s;pirit, like felons that die hard at the gallows, to the la&s;t moment of their lives. Mo&s;t of them marry again, and are &s;o much better than their neighbours, as they are made hone&s;t women of twice over; and that reputation mu&s;t be more than commonly tender, which two coats of plai&s;ter will not keep to|gether.</P>
<P>As a further temptation to our young wives
<PB N="198" REF="204">
not to wait the tedious cour&s;e of nature, but to make them&s;elves widows of living hu&s;bands, as &s;oon as they can, they will recollect, that they en&s;ure advantages to them&s;elves thereby, which natural widows do not enjoy; for in the fir&s;t place they avoid a year's mourning, which is a con&s;ideration not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; in the next place they have precedents for marrying in the fir&s;t week of their widowhood; and as it is the general practice to chu&s;e their gallants, they cer|tainly run no ri&s;que of taking a &s;tep in the dark, which widows &s;ometimes have been &s;u&s;pected to repent of; thirdly, they e&s;cape all bickerings and jealou&s;ies, which di&s;turb the peace of families, by the common practice of ladies putting their &s;econd hu&s;band in mind of what their fir&s;t hu&s;|band would have done, or would have &s;aid on this or that occa&s;ion, had he been alive.&mdash;<HI>Things were not &s;o in my fir&s;t hu&s;band's time&mdash;Oh that my fir&s;t hu&s;band were living! he would not &s;uffer this or that thing to pa&s;s, this or that man to u&s;e me after &s;uch a manner</HI>&mdash;are familiar expre&s;&s;ions in the family dialogues of &s;econd wives in the re|gular order; whereas the Irregulars never ca&s;t the&s;e taunts in the teeth of their &s;pou&s;es, becau&s;e they know the an&s;wer is ready at hand, if they did.</P>
<P>The Irregulars have al&s;o frequent opportuni|ties
<PB N="199" REF="205">
of &s;hewing their affability and &s;weetne&s;s of temper upon meeting their fir&s;t hu&s;bands in public places and mixed companies; the grace|ful acknowledgement of a re&s;pectful curte&s;y, a down-ca&s;t look of mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, or the pret|ty flutter of embarra&s;&s;ment are incidents upon an unexpected rencontre, which a well-bred woman knows how to make the mo&s;t of, and are &s;ure to draw the eyes of the company upon her.</P>
<P>If on the other hand a lady on her divorce chu&s;es to revive her maiden title and take po&s;t in her former rank, the law will probably give her back as good a title to her virgin name, as it found her with. She al&s;o has her advantages; for at the &s;ame time that &s;he is free from the encumbrances of matrimony, &s;he e&s;capes the odi|ous appellation of old maid: Such a lady has the privilege of public places without being pin|ned to the &s;kirts of an old dowager, like other mi&s;&s;es; &s;he can al&s;o indulge a natural pa&s;&s;ion for gaming to a greater length than &s;pin&s;ters dare to go; &s;he can make a repartee or &s;mile at a double entendre, when a &s;pin&s;ter only bites her lips, or is put to the trouble&s;ome re&s;ource of her fan, when &s;he ought to blu&s;h, but cannot.</P>
<P>Before I turned my mind to reflect upon the&s;e and other advantages, &s;o preponderating in fa|vour

of divorces, I u&s;ed to wonder why our le|gi&s;lature was &s;o partial to &s;uitors, and gave &s;uch notorious encouragement and facility to Acts of Parliament for their relief and accommodation; I now &s;ee the good policy of the mea&s;ure, and how much the ea&s;e of his maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects is thereby con&s;ulted. It is confe&s;&s;ed there is a &s;hort monition in the decalogue again&s;t this practice, but nobody in&s;i&s;ts upon it; there are al&s;o &s;ome texts &s;cattered up and down in holy writ to the &s;ame purport, but no well-bred preacher ever handles &s;uch topics in his pulpit; and if a fine lady &s;hould ever read a chapter in the bible, or hear it read to her, it is very ea&s;y to &s;kip over tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and every polite per&s;on knows it is better to make a breach in any thing, than in good man|ners to a lady.</P>
<P>Our Engli&s;h ladies by the frequency of their incontinence, and the divorces thence en&s;uing, have not only furni&s;hed out a mo&s;t amu&s;ing li|brary to young &s;tudents of both &s;exes, but they have effectually retrieved the characters of our wives from &s;inking into contempt with foreign|ers on account of their dome&s;tic in&s;ipidity and attachment to the dull duties of a family. This was once the general opinion, which other na|tions entertained of our matrons, but upon a late tour through a great part of the continent of
<PB N="201" REF="207">
Europe I found it was entirely rever&s;ed, and ideas more expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;pirit univer&s;ally adopted.</P>
<P>It may well be expected, that the influx of fo|reigners, and the out-flow of natives, which the pre&s;ent peace will occa&s;ion, will not &s;uffer the preten&s;ions of our ladies to lo&s;e ground in this particular: Our French neighbours are certain|ly good critics in gallantry, and they need not now &s;tand in dread of a repul&s;e from the women of England, whatever they may apprehend from the men.</P>
<P>Much more occurs to me on this &s;ubject, but the&s;e premi&s;es will &s;erve to introduce an idea, which if the &s;everal ladies, who have &s;tood trial, would club their wits to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in, might be rendered practicable, and that is, of reducing In|famy to a &s;y&s;tem by rules and regulations of manners tending to the propagation and encrea&s;e of divorces in Great Britain. A few loo&s;e hints occur to me on this &s;ubject, but I offer them with the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to better judges, &s;im|ply as rudiments in the art; the refinements mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e who are profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>"As early impre&s;&s;ions are &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting, I would advi&s;e all mothers, who wi&s;h to train their daughters after the above &s;y&s;tem, to put them in their infancy under the care of tho&s;e

<P>IF any of my learned readers, &s;killed in the oriental languages, &s;hall chu&s;e to turn over the thirty and three volumes of Abulfagi, the Arabian hi&s;torian, they may find the following &s;tory: Near one hundred leaves of the Papyrus have been expended in the relation, but I have been at the pains of compre&s;&s;ing it into one paper.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the eleventh century Ab|derama, the la&s;t de&s;cendant of the Samanian fa|mily, who reigned over the territory of Bucha|ria, was be&s;ieged in his capital of Bochara by Mamood the Great, who afterwards reduced all India to his command. This mighty conqueror, who may be &s;tiled the Alexander of the Arabian hi&s;torians, made twelve irruptions into India, and in each expedition &s;wept away as much wealth, and made as great a deva&s;tation of the human &s;pecies, as Nadir Shah in his. Mamood was the &s;on of the u&s;urper Subuctagi, who ex|pelled the father of Abderama from Samarcand, and reduced his empire to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bo|chara only and its dependencies.</P>
<P>Such was the formidable general who &s;at down with his forces before Bochara, and &s;uch
<PB N="206" REF="212">
the hereditary enmity of the&s;e inveterate oppo|nents; Abderama therefore had no re&s;ource but to defend his citadel to the la&s;t extremity: Di&s;|abled by his age from active &s;ervice, he put the garri&s;on under command of a valiant captain named Abdullah: This young prince was of the hou&s;e of Katiba, the general of the Caliph O&s;|man, who conquered Great Bucharia for that victorious Mahommedan: Abdullah was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed per&s;onage of his time, of ad|mirable qualities and matchle&s;s intrepidity. In vain he challenged Mamood to decide the fate of Bochara by &s;ingle combat; he was al&s;o be|loved by Zarima, daughter of Abderama and &s;ole heire&s;s of his crown; the beauty of this prince&s;s was celebrated through all the Ea&s;t; more rhap|&s;odies have been compo&s;ed and chaunted in the prai&s;es of Zarima than even Helen gave a &s;ub|ject to: Our language cannot reach the de&s;crip|tions of the&s;e florid writers; the whole creation has been culled for objects to &s;et in &s;ome com|pari&s;on with Zarima; but as the fire of their imaginations would &s;eem like phren&s;y to ours, I &s;hall not ri&s;que a fall by following them in their flights.</P>
<P>In a furious &s;ally made upon the army of the be&s;iegers, Abdullah at the head of the Bocharians had &s;ingled out the per&s;on of Mamood, and pu&s;hed
<PB N="207" REF="213">
his hor&s;e up to the brea&s;t of that on which Ma|mood was fighting; the &s;hock was furious on both &s;ides; Abdullah received the point of his opponent's lance in his &s;ide, and Mamood was &s;truck from his &s;addle to the ground by the battle-axe of Abdullah; the combatants ru&s;hed in to cover their fallen general, and victory was &s;natched out of the gra&s;p of the brave Bocharian, who fell back wounded among&s;t his companions, and retreated unpur&s;ued into the town after a furious &s;laughter of the foe.</P>
<P>Whether Mamood was di&s;couraged by the ob&s;tinacy of the Bocharians, or, as &s;ome hi&s;to|rians in&s;inuate, was daunted by this attack, which he had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped from, &s;o it was that he let the command of the &s;iege de|volve upon his general Kamhi, and at the head of a &s;couring party made incur&s;ions into the country to lay it wa&s;te with fire and &s;word, and break up the &s;upplies of Bochara.</P>
<P>Kamhi had &s;een the beautiful Zarima; he had been in Abderama's court before Mamood's inva&s;ion, and to &s;ee the prince&s;s was to be ena|moured. No &s;acrifice could be too great for Kamhi to obtain a prize &s;o much above all com|putation in the heated fancy of a lover: He &s;e|cretly imparted to Abderama the conditions, on which he would betray his tru&s;t, and expo&s;e
<PB N="208" REF="214">
the army he commanded to inevitable de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>If the&s;e conditions &s;taggered the aged mo|narch on the &s;core of honour, &s;o did they on the &s;ide of intere&s;t. To &s;ave his crown and city was a tempting offer, and the divided heart of Abderama was not more agitated as a mo|narch for the impending danger of his throne, than it was agonized as a man for the daily &s;uf|ferings of his faithful people. He &s;ubmitted to receive Kamhi into the town, and to treat with him in per&s;on on the &s;ubject of his propo&s;al: Abdullah, from whom this was to be concealed, was now recovering from his wound, but inca|pable of &s;ervice for a time; it was propo&s;ed by Kamhi to exchange ho&s;tage again&s;t ho&s;tage, and Abdullah was in&s;tructed to meet him in the depth of night with one companion on each &s;ide; each general was to exchange armour on the &s;pot, and &s;o to pa&s;s their re&s;pective centi|nels; and mutual &s;ecrecy was pledged between the parties.</P>
<P>There was no difficulty in per&s;uading the ge|nerous Abdullah to this enterprize; Abderama giving him to under&s;tand, that the meeting was to adju&s;t the payment of a &s;um of money, which Kamhi was to receive for betraying the army he commanded before Bochara; the tran&s;action was
<PB N="209" REF="215">
to be kept a profound &s;ecret even from Zarima; the un&s;u&s;pecting Abdullah repaired to his ren|dezvous at the appointed hour without taking leave of the prince&s;s, and Kamhi with his a&s;&s;o|ciate pa&s;&s;ed the city guard unque&s;tioned in the habit of his rival. He ha&s;ted without a mo|ment's lo&s;s to the palace of the old king, and expounding to him the plan he had devi&s;ed for &s;ecuring the performance of his part of the con|tract, nothing now remained for Abderama, but to engage his daughter to make a &s;acrifice, which &s;evere and difficult as it was, he thought he might depend upon her piety and public &s;pi|rit for complying with. In this hope he imme|diately repaired to her chamber, where lie found her repo&s;ing on her couch; he threw him&s;elf at her feet in an agony of tears, and in the mo&s;t &s;upplicating po&s;ture adjured her to ari&s;e and &s;ave her father, country, and her&s;elf from impending de&s;truction: Rou&s;ed from her &s;leep, the beau|teous Zarima immediately demanded the rea&s;on of that &s;olemn adjuration, and what it was that &s;he could do to gain tho&s;e glorious ends&mdash;<HI>Emu|late the magnanimity of Abdullah,</HI> replied the fa|ther, <HI>re&s;ign Abdullah, as that heroic youth, to &s;ave this &s;inking city from extinction, has now re&s;igned his Zarima.</HI>&mdash;A&s;toni&s;hment had now deprived her of the power of utterance, and Abderama
<PB N="210" REF="216">
proceeded without interruption to expo&s;e to her the whole purport of his treaty with Kamhi, and the conditions, on which alone Bochara might be &s;aved, and Mamood's army betrayed into his hands. He prote&s;ted to her that Abdullah had been a party to this treaty, that he had left the city for ever, and to convince her of it, he was ready to produce Kamhi in the very habit, which her lover had exchanged with him for the pur|po&s;e of bringing him to an interview with her, and concluding the agreement.</P>
<P>Not to dwell any longer on Abderama's ar|guments, (in which was I to follow my Arabian author I &s;hould &s;well this recital to an unrea&s;on|able length) it will &s;uffice to &s;ay that the father prevailed. In the original it appears, as if &s;ome &s;hare in the &s;ucce&s;s was owing to female pique, but as the Arabian authors are very &s;ubtle and refined in finding motives and in &s;crutinizing the human pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould hope this &s;ugge&s;tion may be imputed to the hi&s;torian, rather than to the heroine.</P>
<P>As I chu&s;e to pa&s;s over many pages of my original in this place, the reader will now &s;up|po&s;e that the traiterous Kamhi is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his beautiful, but reluctant, victim; and that Abderama has already made a &s;acrifice more painful, than that of Eury&s;theus, or Agamem|non,
<PB N="211" REF="217">
when they immolated their daughters. With the fir&s;t dawn of the morning Kamhi re|paired to the army, and began to &s;et on foot the project he had concerted with Abderama; when he had given out his orders for dividing and di&s;|po&s;ing the troops in &s;uch a manner, as was be&s;t adapted to his de&s;ign, he gave the &s;ignal agreed upon with the king for the &s;ally: The whole garri&s;on was put in motion on this occa&s;ion, and Abderama determined once more to &s;hew him|&s;elf to his army, and command in per&s;on. Eve|ry thing had been &s;o prepared on the part of Kamhi, that the impre&s;&s;ion, which the Bochari|ans made upon the be&s;iegers, was immediate, and the &s;laughter became univer&s;al: Nothing could have &s;aved them from compleat de&s;truction, but the unexpected appearance of Mamood and his army in this &s;ea&s;onable moment for their re|lief; as Mamood's troops were entirely com|po&s;ed of cavalry, he flew into action with ama|zing rapidity; the fainting &s;pirits of the &s;oldiers revived at the &s;ight of their victorious chief; his well-known voice rallied their broken ranks, and they turned upon their pur&s;uers with re|doubled fury: Even the guard, that had been planted upon Abdullah, now ran to their arms and joined the action; the army of Abderama, no longer &s;upported by the valour and conduct
<PB N="212" REF="218">
of their favorite general, began to give way and retreat in di&s;order to the city; in this in&s;tant Abdullah ru&s;hed from his tent, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the eyes of the di&s;pirited Bocharians; the army &s;ent up a &s;hout of joy, the aged Abde|rama &s;unk into his arms, covered with blood and expiring with his wounds; life ju&s;t &s;erved him to exclaim&mdash;<HI>My &s;on! my &s;on!</HI> and then for|&s;ook him; his attendants bore him off to his lit|ter in the rear, whil&s;t Abdullah turned the faces of his &s;oldiers on the foe, and pre&s;&s;ed into the action, where it was hotte&s;t.</P>
<P>The conflict became terrible, every inch of ground was ob&s;tinately di&s;puted, and the com|batants on either &s;ide fell by whole ranks, as if re&s;olved upon maintaining the conte&s;t to the la&s;t man: Night at length put an end to the unde|cided fight, and Abdullah led off his &s;urviving followers into the city, without any attempt on the part of Mamood to pur&s;ue him: His wound in the &s;ide, which was not yet healed, bur&s;t open by the violence of his exertions in the action, and he had received others, under which he found him&s;elf &s;inking, and which he had rea&s;on to believe were mortal; in this extremity he lo&s;t not a moment's time in betaking him&s;elf to his beloved Zarima; his &s;trength ju&s;t &s;erved him to

pre&s;ent him&s;elf before her and to fall exhau&s;ted with his wounds at her feet.</P>
<P>Terrible interview! Zarima was expiring; &s;he had taken poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;upplications of an aged father, the de|liverance of a &s;uffering city, the &s;alvation of an ancient empire, and, above all, the example, as &s;he believed, of her betrothed Abdullah, had pre|vailed with this heroic prince&s;s to &s;acrifice her|&s;elf to the dete&s;ted arms of Kamhi; the contract had been fulfilled upon her father's part, but to &s;urvive it was more than &s;he had engaged for, and an indignity, which her nature could not &s;ubmit to: As &s;oon as the battle joined, &s;he put her re&s;olution into act, and &s;wallowed the mortal draught. Life ju&s;t &s;ufficed to relate this di&s;mal tale to the dying Abdullah, and to receive the account from his lips of the deception, which Abderama had put upon him: The body of her dead father was now brought into the palace; &s;he ca&s;t a look upon it, but was &s;peechle&s;s; fainting, and in the article of death, &s;he dropt into the arms of Abdullah, her head fell upon his brea&s;t, ju&s;t as it was heaving with the la&s;t long-drawn &s;igh, that &s;topt his heart for ever.</P>

of a Frenchman named Chaubert, who happily lived long enough to repent of the extravagance of his mi&s;anthropy. Chaubert was born at Bour|deaux, and died there not many years ago in the Franci&s;can convent; I was in that city &s;oon after this event, and my curio&s;ity led me to collect &s;e|veral particulars relative to this extraordinary humori&s;t. He inherited a good fortune from his parents, and in his youth was of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ubject however to &s;udden caprices and extremes of love and hatred. Various cau&s;es are a&s;&s;igned for his mi&s;anthropy, but the princi|pal di&s;gu&s;t, which turned him furious again&s;t mankind, &s;eems to have ari&s;en from the treachery of a friend, who ran away with his mi&s;tre&s;s, ju&s;t when Chaubert was on the point of marrying her; the ingratitude of this man was certainly of a very black nature, and the provocation heinous, for Chaubert, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were always in ex|tremes, had given a thou&s;and in&s;tances of ro|mantic genero&s;ity to this unworthy friend, and repo&s;ed an entire confidence in him in the mat|ter of his mi&s;tre&s;s: He had even &s;aved him from drowning one day at the imminent ri&s;que of his life, by leaping out of his own boat into the Ga|ronne and &s;wimming to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his, when it was &s;inking in the middle of the &s;tream: His pa&s;&s;ion for his mi&s;tre&s;s was no le&s;s vehement;

&s;o that his di&s;appointment had every aggravation po&s;&s;ible, and, operating upon a nature more than commonly &s;u&s;ceptible, rever&s;ed every principle of humanity in the heart of Chaubert, and made him for the greate&s;t part of his life the declared enemy of human nature.</P>
<P>After many years pa&s;&s;ed in foreign parts he was accidentally brought to his better &s;en&s;es by di&s;covering that through the&s;e events, which he had &s;o deeply re&s;ented, he had providentially e&s;caped from mi&s;eries of the mo&s;t fatal nature: Thereupon he returned to his own country, and, entering into the order of Franci&s;cans, employed the remainder of his life in atoning for his pa&s;t errors after the mo&s;t exemplary manner. On all occa&s;ions of di&s;tre&s;s Father Chaubert's zeal pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to the relief and comfort of the un|fortunate, and &s;ometimes he would enforce his admonitions of re&s;ignation by the lively picture he would draw of his own extravagancies; in extraordinary ca&s;es he has been known to give his communicants a tran&s;cript or diary in his own hand-writing of certain pa&s;&s;ages of his life, in which he had minuted his thoughts at the time they occurred, and which he kept by him for &s;uch extraordinary purpo&s;es.

If a man were to die of a di&s;appointment, how the vengeance does it come to pa&s;s that any body is left alive? You may, if you think well of it, counteract the de&s;igns of the gods, and turn their intended ble&s;&s;ings into actual misfor|tunes, but I do not think their work will be mended by your means; you may, if you plea&s;e, re&s;ent it with a high hand, if your mother, or your &s;on, or your friend &s;hould take the liberty to die, when you wi&s;h them to live; but to me it appears a natural event,
<PB N="232" REF="238">
which no man can keep off from his own per&s;on, or that of any other; you may, if you think it worth your while, be very mi&s;erable, when this woman mi&s;carries, or that woman is brought to bed; you may torment your&s;elf, becau&s;e your mother has a cough, or your mi&s;tre&s;s drops a tear; in &s;hort you may &s;end your&s;elf out of the world with &s;orrow, but I think it better to &s;tay my time in it and be happy.</P>

<P>I MENTIONED in my &s;eventh paper that I had a card from Vane&s;&s;a inviting me to a <HI>Fea&s;t of Rea&s;on.</HI> I confe&s;s I was very curious to know what the nature of this fea&s;t might be; and having been &s;ince favoured with a &s;econd invitation, I &s;hall take the liberty of relating what I &s;aw and heard at that lady's a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The celebrated Vane&s;&s;a has been either a beauty, or a wit all her life long; and of cour&s;e has a better plea for vanity, than falls to mo&s;t women's &s;hare; her vanity al&s;o is in it&s;elf more excu&s;eable for the plea&s;ing colours it &s;ometimes throws upon her character: It gives the &s;pring to charity, good-nature, affability; it makes her
<PB N="233" REF="239">
&s;plendid, ho&s;pitable, facetious; carries her into all the circles of fine people, and crowds all the fine people into her's; it &s;tarts a thou&s;and whim|&s;ical caprices, that furni&s;h employment to the arts, and it has the merit of opening her doors and her pur&s;e to the &s;ons of &s;cience; in &s;hort it admini&s;|ters protection to all de&s;criptions and degrees of genius, from the manufacturer of a tooth-pick to the author of an epic poem: It is a vanity, that is a &s;ure box at an author's fir&s;t night, and a &s;ure card at a performer's benefit; it pays well for a dedication, and &s;tands for &s;ix copies upon a &s;ub&s;cribers li&s;t. Vane&s;&s;a in the centre of her own circle &s;its like the &s;tatue of the Athenian Mi|nerva, incen&s;ed with the breath of philo&s;ophers, poets, painters, orators, and every votari&s;t of art, &s;cience, or fine &s;peaking. It is in her academy young noviciates try their wit and practi&s;e pa|negyric; no one like Vane&s;&s;a can break in a young lady to the poetics, and teach her Pega&s;us to carry a &s;ide-&s;addle: She can make a mathe|matician quote Pindar, a Ma&s;ter in Chancery write novels, or a Birmingham hardware-man &s;tamp rhimes as fa&s;t as buttons.</P>
<P>As I came rather before the modern hour of vi&s;iting, I waited &s;ome time in her room before any of the company appeared; &s;everal new pub|lications on various &s;ubjects were lying on her
<PB N="234" REF="240">
table; they were &s;titched in blue paper and mo&s;t of them fre&s;h from the pre&s;s; in &s;ome &s;he had &s;tuck &s;mall &s;craps of paper, as if to mark where &s;he had left off reading; in others &s;he had dou|bled down certain pages &s;eemingly for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. At la&s;t a meagre little man with a mo&s;t &s;atirical countenance was u&s;hered in, and took his &s;eat in a corner of the room; he eyed me at|tentively for &s;ome time through his &s;pectacles, and at la&s;t acco&s;ted me in the following words;
<Q REND="inline">"You are looking at the&s;e books, Sir; I take for granted they are newly publi&s;hed."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"I be|lieve they are,"</Q>
I replied. <Q REND="inline">"I thought &s;o,"</Q> &s;ays he.
<Q REND="inline">"Then you may depend upon it their au|thors will be here by and by; you may always know what company you are to expect in this hou&s;e by the books upon the table: It is in this way Vane&s;&s;a has got all her wit and learn|ing, not by reading, but by making authors believe &s;he reads their works, and by thus tickling their vanity &s;he &s;ends &s;o many heralds into the world to cry up her fame to the &s;kies; it is a very pretty fine&s;&s;e, and &s;aves a world of time for better amu&s;ements."</Q>
He had no &s;oon|er &s;aid this than Vane&s;&s;a entered the room, and whil&s;t I was making a mo&s;t profound reverence, I beheld &s;omething approaching to me, which looked like columns and arches and porticos in
<PB N="235" REF="241">
the per&s;pective of a playhou&s;e &s;cene; as I rai&s;ed my eyes and examined it a little clo&s;er I recog|nized the ruins of Palmyra embroidered in co|loured &s;ilks upon Vane&s;&s;a's petticoat. It was the fir&s;t vi&s;it I had ever paid, and Vane&s;&s;a not being ready with my name, I made a &s;ilent obei&s;ance, and receiving a &s;mile in return, retreated to my chair: My friend &s;aid a great many &s;mart things upon the ruins of Palmyra, which Vane&s;&s;a on her part contended to be a very proper emblem for an old woman in decay, who had &s;een better days; the wit replied, that in&s;tead of Palmyra it ought to have been Athens, and then &s;he would have been equipped from head to foot in charac|ter. Vane&s;&s;a &s;miled, but maintained the propri|ety of her choice, bidding him ob&s;erve,
<Q REND="inline">"that though &s;he carried a city upon her back, that city all the world knew was planted on a de|&s;art."</Q>
She now addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me, and in the mo&s;t gracious manner a&s;ked me when I hoped to put my project into execution; I an|&s;wered in about two months, thinking &s;he al|luded to the publication of the&s;e papers, a cir|cum&s;tance I knew &s;he was informed of.
<Q REND="inline">"Well, I prote&s;t,"</Q>
&s;ays Vane&s;&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"I envy you the undertaking, and wi&s;h I could find courage enough to accompany you."</Q>
I a&s;&s;ured her there was nothing in the world would make
<PB N="236" REF="242">
me &s;o happy as her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that I was con|fident it would en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to my undertaking. <Q REND="inline">"There you flatter me,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hould do nothing but look after &s;hells and corals and the palaces of the Tritons and Naiads, if I was to go down with you."</Q>&mdash;Here I began to &s;tare mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But after all,"</Q> add|ed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"will your diving-bell carry double?"</Q> This luckle&s;s diving-bell was &s;uch an unexpect|ed plunge to me, that if I had been actually in it, I could &s;carce have been more hampered; &s;o I thought it was better to remain under water, and wait till the real arti&s;t came in to &s;et the mi&s;take to rights: This however my neighbour with the &s;pectacles would not allow of, for &s;u&s;|pecting the mal-entendu, he began to que&s;tion me how long I could &s;tay under water, and whether I could &s;ee di&s;tinctly; he then took a pamphlet from the table, and &s;preading out a large engraved plan of a diving-bell, de&s;ired me to inform him how I managed tho&s;e pipes and conductors of air; all this while he was &s;lyly en|joying my confu&s;ion, till I &s;ummoned re&s;olution to appri&s;e Vane&s;&s;a of her mi&s;take; this produced a thou&s;and polite apologies on her part&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But the&s;e wretched eyes of mine,"</Q>
&s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"are for ever betraying me into blunders."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"That is a pity indeed,"</Q>
replied the wit,
<Q REND="inline">"for they
<PB N="237" REF="243">
illuminate every body el&s;e; but if they betray their owner,"</Q>
adds he,
<Q REND="inline">"it is God's revenge again&s;t murder."</Q>
Several literati now entered the room, to whom Vane&s;&s;a made her compli|ments, particularly to a blind old gentleman, whom &s;he conducted to his chair with great hu|manity, and immediately began talking to him of his di&s;coveries and experiments on the micro|&s;cope. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! madam,"</Q> replied the minute phi|lo&s;opher,
<Q REND="inline">"tho&s;e re&s;earches are now over; &s;ome|thing might have been done, if my eyes had held out, but I lo&s;t my &s;ight ju&s;t as I had di&s;|covered the generation of mites; but this I can take on my&s;elf to pronounce, that they are an oviparous race."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Be content,"</Q> replied Va|ne&s;&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"there is a ble&s;&s;ing upon him who throws even a <HI>mite</HI> into the trea&s;ury of &s;cience."</Q> The philo&s;opher then proceeded to inform her, that he had begun &s;ome curious di&s;&s;ections of the eye of a mole, but that his own would not &s;erve him to complete them:
<Q REND="inline">"If I could have proceeded in them,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline">"I am verily per&s;uaded I could have brought him to his eye-&s;ight by the operation of couching; and now,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline">"I am engaged in a new di&s;covery, in which I mean to employ none but per&s;ons under the like misfortune with my&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;So intere&s;ting a di&s;covery rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity, as well as Vane&s;|&s;a's,
<PB N="238" REF="244">
to enquire into it, and methought even the wit in the &s;pectacles had a fellow-feeling in the &s;ubject.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is a powder, madam,"</Q> added the philo&s;opher,
<Q REND="inline">"which I have prepared for de|&s;troying vermin on fruit trees, and even ants in the We&s;t Indies; I confe&s;s to you,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline">"it is fatal to the eye-&s;ight, for I am per&s;uaded I owe the lo&s;s of mine to it, rather than to the eggs of mites, or the couching of moles; and accordingly I propo&s;e that this powder &s;hall be blown through bellows of my own inventing by none but men who are &s;tone blind; it will be very ea&s;y for your gardener, or over&s;eer of your plantations, to lead them up to their work, and then leave them to perform it; for the du&s;t is &s;o &s;ubtle, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to invent a cover for the eyes, that can &s;ecure them again&s;t it. I believe,"</Q>
added he,
<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ome of it in my pocket, and if you have any flies or &s;piders in the room, I will &s;oon convince you of its efficacy by an experiment before your eyes."</Q>
Vane&s;&s;a eagerly a&s;&s;ured him there was no &s;uch thing in her room, and draw|ing her chair to a di&s;tance, begged him not to trouble him&s;elf with any experiment at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There &s;at an ordinary woman in a black cloak by the fire &s;ide with her feet upon the &s;ender and her knees up, who &s;eemed em|ployed
<PB N="239" REF="245">
upon a cu&s;hion or pillow, which &s;he kept concealed under her apron, without once look|ing at the work &s;he was upon.
<Q REND="inline">"You have read of the Witch of Endor,"</Q>
&s;ays &s;he to me, (ob|&s;erving I had fixed my eyes upon her)
<Q REND="inline">"I am a de&s;cendant of that old lady's, and can rai&s;e the dead, as well as &s;he could."</Q>&mdash;Immediately &s;he put a&s;ide her apron, and produced a head moulded in wax &s;o &s;trikingly like my decea&s;ed friend, the father of Calliope, that the &s;hock it gave me was too apparent to e&s;cape her.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You knew this brave fellow I perceive,"</Q>
&s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"England never owned a better officer; he was my hero, and every line in his face is engraved in my heart."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What mu&s;t it be in mine?"</Q> I an|&s;wered, and turned away to a circle of people, who had collected them&s;elves round a plain, but venerable, old man, and were very attentive to his di&s;cour&s;e: He &s;poke with great energy, and in mo&s;t cho&s;en language; nobody yet attempt|ed to interrupt him, and his words rolled not with the &s;hallow impetuo&s;ity of a torrent, but deeply and fluently, like the copious current of the Nile: He took up the topic of religion in his cour&s;e, and, though pal&s;y &s;hook his head, he looked &s;o terrible in Chri&s;tian armour, and dealt his &s;trokes with &s;o much force and judgment, that Infidelity, in the per&s;ons of &s;everal petty
<PB N="240" REF="246">
&s;kirmi&s;hers, &s;neaked away from before him: One little fellow however had wriggled his chair nearer and nearer to him, and kept baying at him whil&s;t he was &s;peaking, perpetually crying out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Give me leave to ob&s;erve&mdash;not to inter|rupt you, Sir&mdash;That is extremely well, but in an&s;wer to what you &s;ay."</Q>&mdash;All this had been going on without any attention or &s;top on the part of the &s;peaker, who&s;e eyes never once light|ed on the company, till the little fellow, growing out of all patience, walked boldly up to him, and catching hold of a button &s;omewhere above the wai&s;tband of his breeches, with a &s;udden twitch checked the moving-&s;pring of his di&s;cour&s;e, and much to my regret brought it to a full &s;top. The philo&s;opher looked about for the in&s;ect that annoyed him, and having at la&s;t eyed him, as it were a&s;kaunce, demanded what it was provoked him to impatience.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have I &s;aid any thing, good Sir, that you do not comprehend?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> replied he,
<Q REND="inline">"I perfectly well com|prehend every word you have been &s;aying."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Do you &s;o, Sir?"</Q> &s;aid the philo&s;opher,
<Q REND="inline">"then I heartily a&s;k pardon of the company for mi&s;|employing their time &s;o egregiou&s;ly,"</Q>&mdash;and &s;talked away without waiting for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Vane&s;&s;a had now recollected or enquired my name, and in a very gracious manner repeated
<PB N="241" REF="247">
her excu&s;es for mi&s;taking me for the diver.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But if the old &s;aying holds good,"</Q> adds &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"that truth lies at the bottom of a well, I dare &s;ay you will not &s;cruple to dive for it, &s;o I hope I have not given you a di&s;honourable occupa|tion."</Q>
I was endeavouring at a reply, when the wit in the &s;pectacles came up to us and whi&s;pered Vane&s;&s;a in the ear, that the true Di|ving-bell was in yonder corner; &s;he immediate|ly turned that way, and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed whi&s;pered a young lady loud enough for me to hear her&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My dear, I am in your third volume."</Q>&mdash;The girl bowed her head, and by the Arcadian grace that accompanied it, I took it for granted &s;he was a Noveli&s;t.</P>
<P>I now joined a clu&s;ter of people, who had crowded round an actre&s;s, who &s;at upon a &s;opha, leaning on her elbow in a pen&s;ive attitude, and &s;eemed to be counting the &s;ticks of her fan, whil&s;t they were vying with each other in the mo&s;t extravagant encomiums.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You was adorable la&s;t night in Belvidera,"</Q>
&s;ays a pert young par&s;on with a high toupee;
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;at in La|dy Blubber's box, and I can a&s;&s;ure you &s;he and her daughters too wept mo&s;t bitterly&mdash;but then that charming mad &s;cene, by my &s;oul it was a chef d'oeuvre; pray, Madam, give me leave to a&s;k you, was you really in your &s;en&s;es?"</Q>&mdash;<PB N="242" REF="248">
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;trove to do it as well as I could,"</Q> an&s;wer|ed the actre&s;s.
<Q REND="inline">"Do you intend to play come|dy next &s;ea&s;on?"</Q>
&s;ays a lady, &s;tepping up to her with great eagerne&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall do as the manager bids me,"</Q>
&s;he replied.
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be curious to know,"</Q>
&s;ays an elderly lady,
<Q REND="inline">"which part, Madam, you your&s;elf e&s;teem the be&s;t you play?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I always endeavour to make that which I am about the be&s;t."</Q>
An elegant young woman of fa&s;hion now took her turn of interrogatory, and with many apologies begged to be informed by her, if &s;he &s;tudied tho&s;e inchanting looks and attitudes before a gla&s;s?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I never &s;tudy any thing but my au|thor."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then you practi&s;e them in rehear|&s;als?"</Q>
rejoined the que&s;tioner.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;eldom rehear&s;e at all,"</Q>
replied the actre&s;s.
<Q REND="inline">"She has fine eyes,"</Q>
&s;ays a tragic poet to an emi|nent painter,
<Q REND="inline">"what mode&s;t dignity they bear, what awful penetration! mark how they play in tho&s;e deep &s;ockets, like diamonds in the mine! whil&s;t that commanding brow moves over them like a cloud, and carries &s;torm or &s;un-&s;hine, as the deity within directs: She is the child of nature, or, if you will allow me the expre&s;&s;ion, nature her&s;elf; for &s;he is in all things original; in pity, or in terror, penitent, or pre&s;umptuous, fami&s;hed, mad, or dying, &s;he
<PB N="243" REF="249">
is her author's thought per&s;onified; and if this nation, which fa&s;hion now nails by the ears to the &s;hameful pillory of an Italian opera, &s;hall ever be brought back to a true reli&s;h of its native drama, that woman will have the merit of their reformation."</Q>
This rhap&s;ody was received with great tranquillity by the painter, who coolly replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"All that is very well, but where will you &s;ee finer attitudes, than in an opera dance, or more picture&s;que draperies, than in a ma&s;querade? Every man for his own art."</Q>
Vane&s;&s;a now came up, and de&s;iring leave to introduce a young mu&s;e to Melpomene, pre&s;ented a girl in a white frock with a fillet of flowers twined round her hair, which hung down her back in flowing curls; the young mu&s;e made a low obei&s;ance in the &s;tile of an Oriental &s;alam, and with the mo&s;t unembarra&s;&s;ed voice and coun|tenance, whil&s;t the poor actre&s;s was covered with blu&s;hes and &s;uffering torture from the eyes of all the room, broke forth as follows:&mdash;
<Q><L>Oh thou whom Nature's godde&s;s calls her own,</L>
<L>Pride of the &s;tage and favorite of the town&mdash;</L></Q>&mdash;But I can proceed no further, for if the plague had been in the hou&s;e, I &s;hould not have ran away from it more eagerly than I did from Mi&s;s and her poetry.</P>

<P>LEONTINE is one of tho&s;e pur&s;e-proud humori&s;ts, who profe&s;s to &s;peak what they think&mdash;<HI>For why? he is independant and fears no man.</HI> If you complain of an affront from Leon|tine, you are &s;ure to be told&mdash;<HI>That is his way, that is &s;o like Leontine, you mu&s;t take him as he is.</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, there are certain &s;avages in &s;ociety, who &s;eem to have a patent for their brutality, and he is one.</P>
<P>I often think I can give a good gue&s;s at the temper of the ma&s;ter by the &s;ervants looks; in Leontine's family it is &s;trongly marked; I was let in the other day by a &s;taring half-&s;tarved fel|low, fre&s;h from the country, who was out of his wits for fear, not knowing whether he was to &s;ay his ma&s;ter was at home or abroad: Whil&s;t he &s;tood gaping with the door half-opened in his hand, a voice roared out from the parlour, <HI>Who's there?</HI> Upon which he &s;lapped the &s;treet-door in my face and ran to his ma&s;ter; as I was quietly walking away, he followed me up the &s;treet and told me to come back, for his ma&s;ter would &s;ee me. I found Leontine in a fit of the gout; his wife on her knees wrapping flannel round his foot: It mortified me to &s;ee how much the
<PB N="245" REF="251">
world is governed by the abject principle of fear, for the a&s;&s;iduity, with which this ba&s;haw was waited upon by his wife and &s;ervants, was &s;urprizing. After having cur&s;ed the gout, damn|ed his &s;ervants, and &s;colded his wife for her awk|wardne&s;s in &s;wathing his foot, he began to rave about the &s;tate of the nation, crying out to me every now and then&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A fine pa&s;s you have brought things to at la&s;t; I always told you how it would be, but you would not believe me, and now you are ruined, bankrupt, and undone to the devil; I thought what it would come to with your damned American war."</Q>&mdash;I told him I had nothing to do with politics, and knew very little of the matter.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That's true,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand you are writing a book, and going to turn author: You know I am your friend, and always &s;peak my mind, there|fore I mu&s;t tell you, you will repent of what you are about. Cannot you let the world alone? Is it in your power to make it better? Can the devil make it wor&s;e? Why I could write a book if I plea&s;ed, but I &s;corn it; nay I was fool enough to do it once from a &s;illy principle of good-will to my country; and what was the con&s;equence? Why, after pro|ving as plain as two and two make four that we were no longer a nation, that we were

broken, baffled, defeated, and upon the eve of being a province to France&mdash;after having pro|ved all this, d'ye &s;ee, for the good of my coun|try, what was my reward, think you, but to be abu&s;ed, vilified, po&s;ted in the ra&s;cally news|papers, who threw the twelfth of April in my teeth and &s;et the people's heads a madding contrary to all &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, though I had been at the pains of convincing them how fooli&s;h all &s;uch hopes were, and that there was not a chance left, though miracles &s;hould be wrought in their favour, of any po&s;&s;ible &s;alva|tion for this devoted kingdom."</Q></P>
<P>As Leontine is one of tho&s;e <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> rea|&s;oners, who handle their own argument in their own way by que&s;tion and an&s;wer, and know what their opponent has to offer before he has uttered three words, I always leave him a clear &s;tage to fight out the &s;ubject by him&s;elf as he can; &s;o that he proceeded without interruption to put a number of que&s;tions, to which he regu|larly made re&s;pon&s;es, and, though the&s;e were the very oppo&s;ites to what I &s;hould probably have given, I let them pa&s;s without contradiction, till there was a &s;top to the torrent by the introduction of a &s;tranger, who after telling Leontine his name, proceeded to &s;ay he had a little nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle with him, which he &s;hould take the li|berty
<PB N="247" REF="253">
to explain in very few words. This &s;tran|ger was a little, meagre, con&s;umptive man, far advanced in years, of an a&s;pect remarkably meek and humble, &s;o that it was not without &s;urprize I heard him begin as follows.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I wait upon you, Sir, to demand full &s;atisfaction and atone|ment for an injury you have done to my cha|racter by the ba&s;e&s;t lie that ever man uttered, and which if you do not di&s;avow in as public a manner as you reported it, I &s;hall expect you will immediately an&s;wer my challenge, as there is no other mode of redre&s;&s;ing wrongs of &s;o in&s;idious a nature."</Q>
When this gentleman an|nounced his name and de&s;cription I found he was a general officer, who had been upon an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful command in the cour&s;e of the war; and that Leontine in one of his political rhap&s;odies had treated his character according to his cu&s;tom with great &s;currility; this had unluckily pa&s;&s;ed in hearing of a friend of the General's, who had en|deavoured to &s;top Leontine in time, but not be|ing able &s;o to do, had made report to his friend of what had been &s;aid of him in his ab&s;ence. As he fixed his eyes upon Leontine in expectation of his an&s;wer, I ob&s;erved his cheeks, which before were of a ruddy &s;carlet, turn to a deep purple, which gradually darkened into a livid tawney; fear &s;o transformed his features, that the flying
<PB N="248" REF="254">
&s;oldier in Le Brun's battle was not a more per|fect model of horror: His lips, which &s;o lately thundered out vengeance and anathemas again&s;t the whole ho&s;t of critics, magazine-mongers, news-writers, and reviewers, with all their de|vils, runners, and retainers, now quivered with|out the power of utterance, till at la&s;t a gentle murmuring voice was heard to &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"General, if I have given you offence, I am very &s;orry for it, but I &s;u&s;pect that what I &s;aid mu&s;t have been unfairly &s;tated, el&s;e"</Q>&mdash;Here the little gentleman immediately interrupted him, by &s;ay|ing&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This excu&s;e affects the veracity of my friend; I &s;hall therefore take the liberty of calling him into your room, which I did not chu&s;e to do in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, not knowing you had any body with you; but if this gentle|man will have the goodne&s;s to &s;tand in place of your referee on the occa&s;ion, I will bring my witne&s;s face to face, who will te&s;tify to the very words you &s;poke."</Q>
This was no &s;ooner &s;aid than done; for the friend was in the pa&s;&s;age, and in the mo&s;t preci&s;e terms a&s;&s;erted the truth of his information.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And now, Sir,"</Q> re&s;umed the General,
<Q REND="inline">"give me leave to &s;ay there is not a man in England more abhors a per&s;onal quarrel than I do, but I make it my &s;tudy to give no offence, and both my reputation and

<P>The intimidated boa&s;ter took the paper with a trembling hand, and throwing his eye over it, begged to know if it might not be mitigated in &s;ome particulars:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be very glad to oblige you,"</Q>
&s;ays the General,
<Q REND="inline">"in what you wi&s;h, but they are my words, and as I gene|rally think before I &s;peak or write, I am not in the habit of un&s;aying any thing I a&s;&s;ert; you mu&s;t therefore &s;ign to all, or none."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If it mu&s;t be &s;o, it mu&s;t,"</Q> &s;ays Leontine with a &s;igh, and took the pen.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Stop, Sir, if you plea&s;e,"</Q>
interpo&s;ed the General,
<Q REND="inline">"I would know of this gentleman, if he has any thing to offer on your behalf, why you &s;hould not &s;ign that paper."</Q>
I an&s;wered, that I had nothing to offer in the ca&s;e; upon which Leontine put his name to the paper. <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;ays the Gene|ral,
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="250" REF="256">"I am perfectly &s;atisfied, and beg your par|don for the trouble I have given you; I am per&s;uaded you are not a per&s;on, who can in|jure my character, and this paper is of no fur|ther u&s;e."</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he threw it into the fire, and having made his bow to Leontine and wi&s;hing me a good morning, took his friend un|der the arm and coolly walked out of the hou&s;e. As I was &s;u&s;picious Leontine's courage might return after his departure, I thought it be&s;t to follow his example, and, taking up my hat, left the mortified ba&s;haw to his meditations, well &s;atisfied to find an example in confirmation of my opinion&mdash;<HI>That a bully at home is a coward abroad.</HI></P>
<P>As I walked along, meditating on what had pa&s;&s;ed, a doubt for the fir&s;t time aro&s;e in my mind as to the practice of duelling, and I began to think there might be certain advantages ac|cruing to &s;ociety, which, if the immorality of the action could be di&s;pen&s;ed with, might po&s;&s;i|bly balance the evils, &s;o evidently to be &s;et again&s;t them. On the one &s;ide I &s;aw in all its horrors the untimely cata&s;trophe of a father, hu&s;band, &s;on, or brother, hurried out of life, and made the &s;acrifice of a &s;avage fa&s;hion, which the world calls honour: On the other part I reflected within my&s;elf what the &s;tate of manners might
<PB N="251" REF="257">
probably be reduced to, and how much &s;ociety would &s;uffer, if &s;uch overbearing in&s;olent cha|racters as Leontine were not held in re&s;traint by tho&s;e per&s;onal con&s;iderations, which owe their influence to the practice of duelling. To their wives, &s;ervants, and dependant inferiors, from whom no re&s;entment is to be apprehended, the&s;e tyrants are in&s;upportable; to &s;ociety in general they are offen&s;ive as far as they dare; it is not &s;hame, nor a re&s;pect to good manners in any de|gree, nor the fear of the laws, which &s;top them, for none of the&s;e con&s;iderations affect them; neither is it the unarmed hand of man, that can correct them, for the&s;e brutal natures are commonly en|dowed with brutal &s;trength, and Leontine would no more have feared his pui&s;ny antagoni&s;t with|out a weapon than I &s;hould &s;tand in awe of an infant. If the&s;e creatures, thought I, were let loo&s;e upon &s;ociety, and we had nothing but our fi&s;ts to keep them in order, the proverb would be literally made good, and the weake&s;t mu&s;t go to the wall; but that &s;ame lucky invention of gunpowder levels the &s;trong with the feeble, and puts all, who bear the character of a gentleman, upon the &s;ame line of defence: If blows were to be exchanged with impunity, and foul language was to be endured without account, we &s;hould be a nation of rabble. It &s;eems therefore as if
<PB N="252" REF="258">
nothing more were to be wi&s;hed, than for cer|tain mitigations of this terrible re&s;ource, which mu&s;t ultimately depend upon the voluntary mag|nanimity of tho&s;e, who are compelled to re&s;ort to it: What I mean is, to expre&s;s a wi&s;h that gentlemen would think it no derogation from their honour to acknowledge an error, or a&s;k pardon for an offence; and as it can very rarely happen, but that one party mu&s;t to his own con|viction be in the fault, it &s;eems to follow, that all tho&s;e affairs of honour, that can be done away by an apology, might by manly and ingenuous characters be prevented from extremities: As to injuries of that deep nature, which according to the infirmity of human ideas, we are apt to call inexpiable, I pre&s;ume not to give an opinion; and in the aggravating in&s;tance of a blow, I have only to lament, that the &s;ufferer has to expo&s;e his per&s;on to equal danger with the offender. Though &s;ome unhappy in&s;tances of frivolous du|els have lately occurred, I cannot think that it is the vice of the times to be fond of quarrelling; the manners of our young men of di&s;tinction are certainly not of that ca&s;t, and if it lies with any of the pre&s;ent age, it is with tho&s;e half-made-up gentry, who force their way into half-price plays in boots and &s;purs, and are clamorous in the pa&s;&s;ages of the front boxes in a crowded theatre:
<PB N="253" REF="259">
I have with much concern ob&s;erved this to be an increa&s;ing nui&s;ance, and have often wi&s;hed tho&s;e turbulent &s;pirits to be better employed, and that they had di&s;mounted from their hor&s;es either a little &s;ooner or not &s;o &s;oon: But it is not by rea&s;oning the&s;e gentlemen will be taught to cor|rect their behaviour.</P>
<P>I would &s;eriou&s;ly recommend to my readers of all de&s;criptions to keep a careful watch upon their tempers, when they enter into argumenta|tion and di&s;pute; let them be a&s;&s;ured that by their management of them&s;elves on &s;uch occa&s;ions they are to decide their characters; and whether they are to pa&s;s as men of education, temper, and politene&s;s, or as illiterate, hot, and ill-bred blockheads, will depend upon their conduct in this particular.

<Q>No je&s;t, pun, or wittici&s;m, tending to turn an op|ponent or his rea&s;oning into ridicule, or rai&s;e a laugh at his expence, ought by any means to be attempted; for this is an attack upon the temper, not an addre&s;s to the rea&s;on of a di&s;pu|tant.</Q>
<Q>No two di&s;putants &s;hould &s;peak at the &s;ame time, nor any man overpower another by &s;uperiority of lungs, or the loudne&s;s of a laugh, or the &s;udden bur&s;t of an exclamation.</Q>

<P>THE following &s;tory is &s;o extraordinary, that if I had not had it from good autho|rity in the country, where it happened, I &s;hould have con&s;idered it as the invention of &s;ome poet for the fable of a drama.</P>
<P>A Portugue&s;e gentleman, whom I &s;hall beg leave to de&s;cribe no otherwi&s;e than by the name of Don Juan, was lately brought to trial for poi|&s;oning his half-&s;i&s;ter by the &s;ame father, after &s;he was with child by him. This gentleman had for &s;ome years before his trial led a very &s;olitary life at his ca&s;tle in the neighbourhood of Montremos, a town on the road between Li&s;bon and Badajos, the frontier garri&s;on of Spain: I was &s;hewn his ca&s;tle, as I pa&s;&s;ed through that di&s;mal country, about a mile di&s;tant from the road, in a bottom &s;urrounded with cork-trees, and never &s;aw a more melancholy habitation. The circum&s;tances, which made again&s;t this gentleman, were &s;o
<PB N="257" REF="263">
&s;trong and the &s;tory was in &s;uch general circu|lation in the neighbourhood, where he lived, that although he laid out the greate&s;t part of a con|&s;iderable income in acts of charity, no body ever entered his gates to thank him for his bounty, or &s;olicit relief, except one poor father of the Jeronymite convent in Montremos, who was his confe&s;&s;or and acted as his almoner at di&s;cre|tion.</P>
<P>A charge of &s;o black a nature, involving the crime of ince&s;t as well as murder, at length reached the ears of ju&s;tice, and a commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent to Montremos to make enquiry into the ca&s;e: The &s;uppo&s;ed criminal made no at|tempt to e&s;cape, but readily attended the &s;um|mons of the commi&s;&s;ioners. Upon the trial it came out from the confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner, as well as from the depo&s;ition of witne&s;&s;es, that Don Juan had lived from his infancy in the fa|mily of a rich merchant at Li&s;bon, who carried on a con&s;iderable trade and corre&s;pondence in the Brazils; Don Juan being allowed to take this merchant's name, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that he was his natural &s;on, and a clande&s;tine affair of love having been carried on between him and the merchant's daughter Jo&s;epha, who was an only child, &s;he became pregnant, and a medicine being admini&s;tered to her by the hands
<PB N="258" REF="264">
of Don Juan, &s;he died in a few hours after with all the &s;ymptoms of a per&s;on, who had taken poi&s;on. The mother of the young lady &s;urvived her but a few days, and the father threw him&s;elf into a convent of Mendicants, making over by deed of gift the whole of his property to the &s;up|po&s;ed murderer.</P>
<P>In this account there &s;eemed a &s;trange ob&s;cu|rity of facts, for &s;ome made &s;trongly to the cri|mination of Don Juan, and the la&s;t-mentioned circum&s;tance was of &s;o contradictory a nature, as to throw the whole into perplexity; and therefore to compel the pri&s;oner to a further elucidation of the ca&s;e, it was thought proper to interrogate him by torture.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was preparing, Don Juan without betraying the lea&s;t alarm upon what was going forward, told his judges that it would &s;ave them and him&s;elf &s;ome trouble, if they would receive his confe&s;&s;ion upon certain points, to which he &s;hould truly &s;peak, but beyond which all the tortures in the world could not force one &s;ylla|ble: He &s;aid that he was not the &s;on as it was &s;uppo&s;ed of the merchant, with whom he lived, nor allied to the decea&s;ed Jo&s;epha any otherwi&s;e than by the tendere&s;t ties of mutual affection and a promi&s;e of marriage, which however he acknowledged had not been &s;olemnized: That
<PB N="259" REF="265">
he was the &s;on of a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune in the Brazils, who left him an infant to the care of the merchant in que&s;tion; that the merchant for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf cho&s;e to call him by his own name, and this being done in his infancy, he was taught to believe, that he was an orphan youth, the &s;on of a di&s;tant relation of the per&s;on who adopted him; he beg|ged his judges therefore to ob&s;erve that he never under&s;tood Jo&s;epha to be his &s;i&s;ter; that as to her being with child by him, he acknowledged it, and prayed God forgivene&s;s for an offence, which it had been his intention to repair by marrying her; that with re&s;pect to the medi|cine, he certainly did give it to her with his own hands, for that &s;he was &s;ick in con&s;equence of her pregnancy, and being afraid of creating alarm or &s;u&s;picion in her parents, had required him to order certain drugs from an apothecary, as if for him&s;elf, which he accordingly did, and he verily believed they were faithfully mixed, ina&s;much as he &s;tood by the man, whil&s;t he pre|pared the medicine, and &s;aw every ingredient &s;eparately put in.</P>
<P>The judges thereupon a&s;ked him, if he would take it on his con&s;cience to &s;ay, that the lady did not die by poi&s;on: Don Juan, bur&s;ting into tears for the fir&s;t time, an&s;wered, to his eternal
<PB N="260" REF="266">
&s;orrow he knew that &s;he did die by poi&s;on.&mdash;Was that poi&s;on contained in the medicine &s;he took?&mdash;It was.&mdash;Did he impute the crime of mixing the poi&s;on in the medicine to the apo|thecary, or did he take it on him&s;elf?&mdash;Neither the apothecary, nor him&s;elf, was guilty.&mdash;Did the lady from a principle of &s;hame, (he was then a&s;ked) commit the act of &s;uicide, and infu&s;e the poi&s;on without his knowledge?&mdash;He &s;tarted into horror at the que&s;tion and took God to witne&s;s, that &s;he was innocent of the deed.</P>
<P>The judges &s;eemed now confounded, and for a time ab&s;tained from any further interrogatories, debating the matter among&s;t them&s;elves by whi&s;|pers; when one of them ob&s;erved to the pri&s;oner, that according to his confe&s;&s;ion he had &s;aid &s;he did die by poi&s;on, and yet by the an&s;wers he had now given, it &s;hould &s;eem as if he meant to ac|quit every per&s;on, on whom &s;u&s;picion could po&s;|&s;ibly re&s;t; there was however one interrogatory left, which unnatural as it was, he would put to him for form's &s;ake only, before they proceeded to greater extremities, and that que&s;tion involved the father or mother of the lady.&mdash;Did he mean to impute the horrid intention of murdering their child to the parents?&mdash;No, replied the pri&s;oner in a firm tone of voice, I am certain no &s;uch in|tention ever entered the hearts of the unhappy
<PB N="261" REF="267">
parents, and I &s;hould be the wor&s;t of &s;inners, if I imputed it to them.&mdash;The judges upon this declared with one voice that he was trifling with the court, and gave orders for the rack; they would however for the la&s;t time demand of him, if he knew who it was that did poi&s;on Jo&s;epha: to which he an&s;wered without he&s;itation, that he did know, but that no tortures &s;hould force him to declare it; as to life, he was weary of it, and they might di&s;po&s;e of it, as they &s;aw fit; he could not die in greater tortures than he had lived.</P>
<P>They now took this peremptory recu&s;ant, and &s;tripping him of his upper garments, laid him on the rack; a &s;urgeon was called in, who kept his fingers on his pul&s;e; and the executioners were directed to begin their tortures; they had given him one &s;evere &s;tretch by ligatures fixed to his extremities and pa&s;&s;ed over an axle, which was turned by a windla&s;s; the &s;train upon his mu&s;cles and joints by the action of this infernal engine was dreadful, and nature &s;poke her &s;ufferings by a horrid cra&s;h in every limb; the &s;weat &s;tarted in large drops upon his face and bo&s;om, yet the man was firm amid&s;t the agonies of the machine, not a groan e&s;caped, and the fiend who was &s;uperintendant of the helli&s;h work, declared they might encrea&s;e his tortures upon the next tug, for that his pul&s;e had not varied a &s;troke
<PB N="262" REF="268">
nor abated of its &s;trength in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree.</P>
<P>The tormentors had now begun a &s;econd operation with more violence than the former, which their devili&s;h ingenuity had contrived to vary &s;o as to extort acuter pains from the appli|cation of the engine to parts, that had not yet had their full &s;hare of the fir&s;t agony; when &s;ud|denly a monk ru&s;hed into the chamber and call|ed out to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h judges to de&s;i&s;t from torturing that innocent man, and take the confe&s;&s;ion of the murderer from his own lips. Upon a &s;ignal from the judges, the executioners let go the en|gine at once, and the joints &s;napped audibly into their &s;ockets with the ela&s;ticity of a bow. Na|ture &s;unk under the revul&s;ion, and Don Juan fainted on the rack. The monk immediately with a loud voice exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Inhuman wretches, delegates of hell and agents of the devil, make ready your engine for the guilty, and take off your bloody hands from the inno|cent, for behold!"</Q>
(and &s;o &s;aying he threw back his cowl)
<Q REND="inline">"behold the father and the mur|derer of Jo&s;epha!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly &s;tarted with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; the judges &s;tood agha&s;t, and even the daemons of torture rolled their eye-balls on the monk with horror and di&s;may.</P>

At length the father of Don Juan died, and by will bequeathed his fortune to me in failure of his &s;on and his heirs. I had already advanced &s;o far in guilt, that the temptation of this con|tingency met no re&s;i&s;tance in my mind, and I determined upon removing this bar to my ambition, and propo&s;ed to my wife to &s;ecure the prize, that fortune had hung within our reach, by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the heir. She re|volted from the idea with horror, and for &s;ome time her thoughts remained in &s;o di&s;turbed a &s;tate, that I did not think it prudent to renew the attack: After &s;ome time the agent of the decea&s;ed arrived in Li&s;bon from the Brazils, and as he was privy to my corre&s;pondence, it became nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;cover to Don Juan who he was, and al&s;o what fortune he

In this cri&s;is, threatened with &s;hame and detection on one hand, and tempted by avarice, pride, and the devil on the other, I won over my reluctant wife to a participa|tion of my crime, and we mixed that do&s;e with poi&s;on, which we believed was intended for Don Juan, but which in fact was de&s;tined for our only child: She took it; heaven di&s;|charged its vengeance on our heads, and we &s;aw our daughter expire in agonies before our eyes, with the bitter aggravation of a double murder, for the child was alive within her. Are there words in language to expre&s;s our lamentations? Are there tortures in the reach of even your invention to compare with tho&s;e we felt? Wonderful were the &s;truggles of na|ture in the heart of our expiring child: She bewailed us; &s;he con&s;oled, nay &s;he even forgave us. To Don Juan we made imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">diate con|fe&s;&s;ion of our guilt, and conjured him to inflict that puni&s;hment upon us, which ju&s;tice de|manded and our crimes de&s;erved. It was in this dreadful moment that our daughter with her la&s;t breath by the mo&s;t &s;olemn adjurations exacted and obtained a promi&s;e from Don Juan not to expo&s;e her parents to a public exe|cution by di&s;clo&s;ing what had pa&s;&s;ed.

<P>No &s;ooner had the monk pronounced the&s;e words in a loud and furious tone, than the wretched Don Juan drew a &s;igh; a &s;econd would have followed, but heaven no longer could tolerate the agonies of innocence, and &s;topped his heart for ever.</P>

<P>I THINK it much to be lamented that our Engli&s;h news-papers have &s;uch an exten&s;ive circulation through Europe, unle&s;s proper means could be taken to re&s;train their exce&s;&s;ive licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s. As few foreigners will believe any government &s;o void of re&s;ource in this particu|lar, they can no otherwi&s;e account for our not correcting the&s;e abu&s;es of the pre&s;s, but becau&s;e we want the will and not the power. Among&s;t the cau&s;es that have lately operated to increa&s;e their circulation and &s;ucce&s;s, I hope for the ho|nour of human nature, their licentiou&s;ne&s;s is not one; and yet it appears as if their encourage|ment had kept pace with their malignance. If I had not experienced the bad effects they have upon the minds of people in other countries, I &s;hould not have thought &s;uch publications capa|ble of &s;uch mi&s;chief. Though the conductors of them &s;eem carele&s;s about con&s;equences, I will not believe it was in their minds to do a delibe|rate injury to their country; but as they are not di&s;po&s;ed to put a bridle on them&s;elves, it were to

<P>I have been turning over &s;ome papers to find out the chief profe&s;&s;ors of this art, which I be|lieve is now carried to its highe&s;t &s;tate of im|provement: Truth compels me to &s;ay, that with regret I have di&s;covered &s;everal among&s;t them, who ought to have under&s;tood them&s;elves better, but whil&s;t there is hope they will amend, I am contented they &s;hould e&s;cape; at lea&s;t I &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence, regarding them for the pre&s;ent as per&s;ons &s;urprized into bad company, and chargeable with indi&s;cretion rather than de|pravity.</P>

A fooli&s;h partiality &s;ome people &s;till have for phy&s;icians regularly bred, and a &s;queami&s;h unwillingne&s;s to repair to back-doors and blind alleys for re|lief, oblige them to u&s;e &s;trong words to combat &s;trong prejudices.

Though a man's caprice may be tired of a beautiful object long enjoyed, yet when he &s;ees an old acquaintance dre&s;&s;ed out in new colours, and glowing in the flowery de&s;cription of the&s;e luxuriant writers, I &s;hould expect that his affection would revive, and that he would recall the cruel &s;entence of alienation.

<P>SOCIETY in de&s;potic governments is nar|rowed according to the degree of rigour, which the ruling tyrant exerci&s;es over his &s;ub|jects. In &s;ome countries it is in a manner an|nihilated. As de&s;poti&s;m relaxes towards limited monarchy, &s;ociety is dilated in the &s;ame propor|tion. If we con&s;ider freedom of condition in no other light than as it affects &s;ociety, a monarchy limited by law, like this of ours, is perhaps the free&s;t con&s;titution upon earth; becau&s;e was it to diverge from the center on which it now re&s;ts, either towards de&s;poti&s;m on one hand, or demo|cracy on the other, the re&s;traints upon &s;ocial freedom would operate in the &s;ame degree, tho' not in the &s;ame mode; for whether that re&s;traint is produced by the awe of a court, or the pro|mi&s;cuous licentiou&s;ne&s;s of a rabble, the barrier is in either ca&s;e broken down; and whether it lets the cobler or the king's me&s;&s;enger into our company, the tyranny is in&s;upportable and &s;ociety is en&s;laved.</P>

As &s;oon as he has had time to examine the component parts of this circle, into which he has &s;o happily &s;tept, he readily di&s;co|vers that it is a circle, for he goes round and round without one excur&s;ion; the whole party follows the &s;ame &s;tated revolution, their minds and bodies keep the &s;ame orbit, their opinions ri&s;e and &s;et with the regularity of planets, and for what is pa&s;&s;ing without their &s;phere they know nothing of it.

that would &s;peak peace and plea&s;ure to the board, and turn good fellow&s;hip into loud con|tention and a &s;trife of tongues.</P>
<P>The right a&s;&s;umed by our news-papers of publi&s;hing what they are plea&s;ed to call Parlia|mentary Debates I mu&s;t regard as one of the greate&s;t evils of the time, replete with foreign and dome&s;tic mi&s;chief: Our orators &s;peak pam|phlets, and the &s;enate is turned into a theatre. The late hours of parliament, which to a degree are become fa&s;hionable, are in effect de&s;tructive to &s;ociety. I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with ob&s;erving collaterally on this occa&s;ion that profe&s;&s;ional men in England con&s;ort more exclu&s;ively among&s;t them&s;elves, and communicate le&s;s ge|nerally than in other countries, which gives their conver&s;ation, however informing, an air of pedantry, contracted by long habits, great ardour for their profe&s;&s;ion and deep learning in it.</P>
<P>As for &s;lander, which among&s;t other evils owes much of its propagation to the &s;ame vehicle of the daily pre&s;s, it is the poi&s;on of &s;ociety; depre&s;&s;es virtuous ambition, damps the early &s;hoots of genius, puts the innocent to pain, and drives the guilty to de&s;peration; it infu&s;es &s;u&s;picion into the be&s;t natures, and loo&s;ens the cement of the &s;tronge&s;t friend&s;hips;
<PB N="284" REF="290">
very many affect to de&s;pi&s;e it, few are &s;o high|minded as not to feel it; though common &s;landerers &s;eldom have it in their power to hurt e&s;tabli&s;hed reputations, yet they can always con|trive to &s;poil company, and put hone&s;t men to the trouble of turning them out of it.</P>
<P>It is a common &s;aying that authors are more &s;piteful to each other, and more irritable under an attack, than other men; I do not believe the ob&s;ervation is well founded; every &s;en&s;ible man knows, that his fame, e&s;pecially of the literary kind, before it can pa&s;s current in the world, pays a duty on entrance, like &s;ome &s;ort of mer|chandize, <HI>ad valorem</HI>; he knows that there are always &s;ome who live upon the plunder of con|demned reputations, watching the tides of popu|lar &s;avour in hopes of making &s;eizures to their own account&mdash;<HI>Habent venenum pro victu, immo pro deliciis.</HI>&mdash;The little injury &s;uch men do to letters chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tupidity of their own productions: They may to a certain degree check a man's living fame, but if he writes to po&s;terity, he is out of their reach, becau&s;e he appeals to a court, where they can never appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>When we give our prai&s;e to any man's cha|racter or performances, let us give it ab&s;olutely, and without compari&s;on, for it is ju&s;tly remarked
<PB N="285" REF="291">
by foreigners, that we &s;eldom commend po&s;itive|ly: This remark bears both again&s;t our good-nature and our good &s;en&s;e; but let no man by this or any other declamation again&s;t &s;lander be awed into that timid prudence, which affecting the name of candour, dares not to condemn, and of cour&s;e is not intitled to applaud. Truth and ju&s;tice have their claims upon us, and our te&s;ti|mony again&s;t vice, folly and hypocri&s;y is due to &s;ociety; manly re&s;entment again&s;t mi&s;chievous characters, cleanly ridicule of vanity and imper|tinence, and fair critici&s;m of what is under pub|lic review are the prerogatives of a free &s;pirit; they peculiarly belong to Engli&s;hmen, and he betrays a right con&s;titutionally inherent in him, who from mean and per&s;onal motives forbears to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P>When I have &s;aid this, I think it right to add, that I cannot &s;tate a ca&s;e, in which a man can be ju&s;tified in treating another's name with free|dom, and concealing his own.</P>

<P>THE pa&s;&s;age, which I have &s;elected for the motto of this paper, will &s;hew that I in|tend to devote it to the con&s;ideration of the vice of <HI>Gaming</HI>; and I forbore to &s;tate it in my pre|ceding e&s;&s;ay among&s;t the cau&s;es, that affect &s;o|ciety in this country, becau&s;e I regarded it as an evil too enormous to be brought within the brief enumeration therein contained, re&s;olving to treat it with that particular re&s;pect and attention, which its high &s;tation and dignity in mi&s;chief have a claim to.</P>
<P>Though I have no he&s;itation at beginning the attack, I beg leave to premi&s;e that I am totally without hope of carrying it. I may &s;ay to my antagoni&s;ts in the words, though not altogether in the &s;en&s;e, that the angel Gabriel does to his&mdash;
<Q>Satan, I know thy &s;trength, and thou know'&s;t mine.</Q>
What avails my hurling a feeble e&s;&s;ay at the
<PB N="287" REF="293">
heads of this hydra, when the immortal drama of <HI>The Game&s;ter</HI> lies trodden under his feet?</P>
<P>Con&s;cious that I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;trength, I &s;hall not a&s;&s;ume the importance of a champion, and as I am not of dignity enough to be angry, I &s;hall keep my temper and my di&s;tance too, &s;kirmi&s;hing like tho&s;e in&s;ignificant gentry, who play the part of teazers in the Spani&s;h bull-fights, &s;ticking arrows in his cre&s;t to provoke him to bellow, whil&s;t bolder combatants engage him at the point of his horns.</P>
<P>It is well for Game&s;ters, that they are &s;o nu|merous as to make a &s;ociety of them&s;elves, for it would be a &s;trange abu&s;e of terms to rank them among&s;t &s;ociety at large, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to prey upon all who compo&s;e it. Strictly &s;peaking it will bear a doubt, if a Game&s;ter has any other title to be called a man, except under the di&s;tinction of Hobbes, and upon claim to the charter of <HI>Homo Homini Lupus</HI>&mdash;As a <HI>Hu|man Wolf</HI> I grant he has a right to his <HI>wolfi&s;o prerogatives:</HI> He, who &s;o far &s;urprizes my rea|&s;on or debauches my principle, as to make me a party in my own de&s;truction, is a wor&s;e enemy than he who robs me of my property by force and violence, becau&s;e he &s;inks me in my own opinion; and if there was virtue in mankind, &s;ufficient for their own defence, hone&s;t men
<PB N="288" REF="294">
would expel game&s;ters as outlaws from &s;ociety, and good citizens drive them from the &s;tate, as the de&s;troyers of human happine&s;s, wretches, who make the parent childle&s;s and the wife a widow.</P>
<P>But what avail a parcel of &s;tatutes again&s;t gaming, when they, who make them, con&s;pire together for the infraction of them? Why de|clare gaming-debts void in law, when that &s;illy principle, &s;o fal&s;ely called honour (at once the idol and the ideot of the world) takes all tho&s;e debts upon it&s;elf and calls them debts of honour? It is not among&s;t things practicable to put gaming down by &s;tatute. If the face of &s;ociety was &s;et &s;teadily again&s;t the vice; if parents were agreed to &s;purn at the alliance of a game&s;ter, however ennobled; if our &s;eminaries of education would enforce their di&s;cipline again&s;t early habits of play; if the crown, as the fountain of honour, and the virtuous part of the fair &s;ex, as the di&s;|pen&s;ers of happine&s;s, would reprobate all men addicted to this de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ion, &s;omething might perhaps be done. If trade&s;men would con&s;ult their own intere&s;t, and give no credit to game&s;ters; if the infamous gang of money|lenders could be ab&s;olutely extingui&s;hed, and the people at large, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing again&s;t a loyal fellow-&s;ubject, becau&s;e he wor&s;hips God accord|ing
<PB N="289" REF="295">
to the religion of his ance&s;tors at a Catholic altar, would exerci&s;e their re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e illegal places of re&s;ort, where de&s;peradoes meet for nightly pillage, this contagious evil might po&s;&s;ibly be checked; but when it is only to be hoped that a combination of remedies might &s;tem the di&s;ea&s;e, how can we expect a recovery, when no one of them all is admini&s;|tered?</P>
<P>Though dome&s;tic mi&s;ery mu&s;t follow an alli|ance with a game&s;ter, matches of this &s;ort are made every day; a parent, who con&s;ents &s;o to &s;acrifice his child, mu&s;t either place his hope in her reforming her hu&s;band, or el&s;e he mu&s;t have made up his mind to &s;et con&s;equences at defi|ance; a very fooli&s;h hope, or a very fatal prin|ciple. There can be no dome&s;tic comfort in the arms of a game&s;ter, no conjugal a&s;ylum in his heart: Weak and ignorant young women may be duped into &s;uch connections; vain and &s;elf-conceited ones may adventure with their eyes open, and tru&s;t to their attractions for &s;ecurity again&s;t misfortune; but let them be a&s;&s;ured there is not a page in the world's hi&s;tory, that will furni&s;h them with an example to palliate their pre&s;umption; eager to &s;natch the pre&s;ent plea|&s;ures of a voluptuous pro&s;pect, they care little for the ruin, which futurity keeps out of &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="296">With the cleare&s;t conviction in my mind of the general advantages of public education, I mu&s;t acknowledge a &s;u&s;picion that due attention is not paid in our great &s;eminaries of education to re&s;train this fatal pa&s;&s;ion in its fir&s;t approaches. I fear there are &s;ome evidences of a guilty negli|gence now in operation, &s;preading poi&s;on as they flow, and carrying with them in their cour&s;e all the charms of eloquence, the flow of wit, and fa&s;cinating &s;pell of &s;cience; &s;anctified by fa&s;hion, Gaming-hou&s;es, which out-peer the royal palace, ri&s;e around it in defiance; trophies and monu|ments of the triumphs of di&s;&s;ipation. The wife, who&s;e hu&s;band enters tho&s;e doors, and the parent, who owns a &s;on within them, mu&s;t either era|dicate affection and nature from their hearts, or take leave of happine&s;s for ever. Woe be to the nation, who&s;e police cannot, or dare not, correct &s;uch an evil! 'Tis fooli&s;h to lament the amputation of a limb, when the mortality is in our vitals.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not take upon my&s;elf to lay down rules for kings, or affect to pronounce what a &s;overeign can, or cannot, do to di&s;countenance gaming in this kingdom; but I will venture to &s;ay that &s;omething more is requi&s;ite than mere example. <HI>It was in the decline of Rome, when the provinces were falling off from her empire, whil&s;t a virtuous</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="297"><HI>but unfortunate prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne, that the greate&s;t part of Africa was in revolt: The Gene|ral, who commanded the Roman legions, was a &s;ol|dier of approved courage in the field, but of mean talents and di&s;&s;olute manners. This man in the mo&s;t imminent cri&s;is for the intere&s;ts of Rome, &s;uf|fered and encouraged &s;uch a &s;pirit of gaming to ob|tain among&s;t his officers in their military quarters, that the fine&s;t army in the world entirely lo&s;t their di&s;cipline, and remained inactive, whil&s;t a few levies of raw in&s;urgents wre&s;ted from the Roman arms the riche&s;t provinces of the empire. Hi&s;tory records nothing further of this man's fate or for|tune, but leaves us to conclude that the reproaches of his own con&s;cience and the execrations of po&s;terity were all the puni&s;hment he met with. The empire was rent by faction, and his party re&s;cued him from the di&s;grace he merited.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t re&s;ource in all de&s;perate ca&s;es, which the law cannot, or will not, reach, lies with the people at large: It is not without rea&s;on I &s;tate it as the la&s;t, becau&s;e their method of curing di&s;|orders is like the violent medicines of empiries, never to be applied to but in ab&s;olute extremity. If the people were, like Shake&s;pear's Julius Cae|&s;ar, <HI>never to do wrong but with ju&s;t cau&s;e,</HI> I &s;hould not &s;o much dread the operation of their reme|dies; I &s;hall therefore venture no further, than
<PB N="292" REF="298">
to expre&s;s an humble wi&s;h, that when it &s;hall be their high and mighty plea&s;ure to proceed again to the pulling down and burning of hou&s;es, tho&s;e hou&s;es may not be the repo&s;itories of &s;cience, but the receptacles of game&s;ters.</P>
<P>When a man of fortune turns game&s;ter, the act is &s;o devoid of rea&s;on, that we are at a lo&s;s to find a motive for it; but when one of de&s;pe|rate circum&s;tances takes to the trade, it only proves that he determines again&s;t an hone&s;t cour&s;e of life for a maintenance, and having his choice to make between robbery and gaming, prefers that mode of depredation, which expo&s;es him to lea&s;t danger, and has a coward's plea for his vocation. Such an one may &s;ay with An|tient Pi&s;tol&mdash;
<Q><L>I'll live by Nym, and Nym &s;hall live by me,</L>
<L>And friend&s;hip &s;hall combine and brotherhood;</L>
<L>Is not this ju&s;t?&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>In the ju&s;tice of his league I do not join with Antient Pi&s;tol, but I am ready to allow there is &s;ome degree of common &s;en&s;e in this cla&s;s of the brotherhood, of which common &s;en&s;e I cannot trace a &s;hadow among&s;t the others. A prefer|ence therefore in point of under&s;tanding is clear|ly due to the vagabonds and de&s;peradoes; as to the man, who, for the &s;illy chance of winning
<PB N="293" REF="299">
what he does not want, ri&s;ques every thing he ought to value, his defence is in his folly, and if we rob him of that, we probably take from him the only harmle&s;s quality he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. If however &s;uch an in&s;tance &s;hall occur, and the daemon of gaming &s;hall enter the &s;ame brea&s;t, where honour, courage, wit, wi&s;dom re&s;ide, &s;uch a mind is like a motley &s;uit of cards, where <HI>kings, queens</HI> and <HI>knaves</HI> are packed together, and make up the game with temporary good-fellow&s;hip, but it is a hundred to one but <HI>the knave will beat them all out of doors</HI> in the end.</P>
<P>As there are &s;eparate gangs of game&s;ters, &s;o there are different modes of gaming; &s;ome &s;et their property upon games of &s;imple chance, &s;ome depend upon &s;kill, others upon fraud.</P>
<P>The game&s;ters of the fir&s;t de&s;cription run upon luck: a &s;illy crew of Fortune's fools; this kind of play is only fit for them, who&s;e circum|&s;tances cannot be made wor&s;e by lo&s;ing, other|wi&s;e there is no proportion between the good and the evil of the chance; for the good of dou|bling a man's property bears no compari&s;on with the evil of lo&s;ing the whole; in the one ca&s;e he only gains &s;uperfluities, in the other he lo&s;es nece&s;&s;aries; and he, who &s;takes what life wants again&s;t that which life wants not, makes a fooli&s;h bet, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it. Games of
<PB N="294" REF="300">
chance are traps to catch &s;chool-boy novices and gaping country-&s;quires, who begin with a guinea and end with a mortgage; whil&s;t the old &s;tagers in the game, keeping their pa&s;&s;ions in check, watch the ebb and flow of fortune, till the booby they are pillaging &s;ees his acres melt at every ca&s;t.</P>
<P>In games of &s;kill, depending upon practice, rule and calculation, the accompli&s;hed profe&s;&s;or has advantages, which may bid defiance to for|tune; and the extreme of art approaches &s;o clo&s;ely to the beginning of fraud, that they are apt to run one into the other: in the&s;e engage|ments, &s;elf-conceit in one party and di&s;&s;imula|tion in the other are &s;ure to produce ruin, and the &s;ufferer has &s;omething more than chance to arraign, when he reviews the wreck of his for|tune and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family.</P>
<P>The drama of a game&s;ter commonly has &s;elf|murder for its cata&s;trophe, and authors, who write to the pa&s;&s;ions, are apt to dwell upon this &s;cene with partial attention, as the &s;triking moral of the piece; I confe&s;s it is a moral, that does not &s;trike me; for as this action, whenever it happens, devolves to the &s;hare of the lo&s;ing, not of the winning game&s;ter, I cannot di&s;cover any particular edification, nor feel any extraordinary pathos, in a man's falling by his own hand,
<PB N="295" REF="301">
when he is no longer in a capacity of doing or &s;uffering further injury in &s;ociety. I look upon every man as a &s;uicide from the moment he takes the dice-box de&s;perately in hand, and all that follows in his career from that fatal time is only &s;harpening the dagger before he &s;trikes it to his heart.</P>
<P>My proper concern in this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay is to &s;hew, that Gaming is the chief ob&s;tructing cau&s;e, that affects the &s;tate of &s;ociety in this nation, and I am &s;en&s;ible I need not have employed &s;o many words to convince my reader that game|&s;ters are very dull and very dangerous compani|ons. When blockheads rattle the dice-box, when fellows of vulgar and ba&s;e minds &s;it up whole nights contemplating the turn of a card, their &s;tupid occupation is in character; but whenever a cultivated under&s;tanding &s;toops to the tyranny of &s;o vile a pa&s;&s;ion, the friend of mankind &s;ees the injury to &s;ociety with that &s;ort of aggravation, as would attend the taking of his pur&s;e on the highway, if upon &s;eizure of the felon, he was unexpectedly to di&s;cover the per&s;on of a judge.</P>
