<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FRUITFUL in good and ill, the teaming earth</L>
<L>To wheat and tares affords promi&s;cuous birth:</L>
<L>At once, from nature's womb, ri&s;e woe and weal;</L>
<L>The &s;prings that poi&s;on, and the &s;treams that heal.</L>
<L>Nay more, her offspring each and all contain,</L>
<L>Within them&s;elves, both antidote and bane.</L>
<L>Each is a jarring world, where death yields life;</L>
<L>And concord ri&s;es out of endle&s;s &s;trife.</L>
<L>Each &s;eems di&s;tinct, yet all together bound:</L>
<L>And &s;eparate and collectively is found</L>
<L>A hoard of infinite; a countle&s;s ma&s;s</L>
<L>Of miracles within a blade of gra&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fir&s;t of the tribe, and ma&s;ter of the whole,</L>
<L>Man &s;tands erect; the &s;overeign and the &s;oul.</L>
<L>In him all union and di&s;union &s;hine:</L>
<L>He's now above half brute; now more than half divine.</L>
<L>Wayward in humour; infinite in wit;</L>
<L>The &s;lave of all, to none will he &s;ubmit;</L>
<L>In act an idiot; in conceit a &s;age;</L>
<L>Mov'd by a breath, he'll brave the tempe&s;t's rage;</L>
<L>Now &s;oar, a demi-god; now &s;ink, a &s;traw;</L>
<L>Now weep, a child; now give the planets law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Railing at wretchedne&s;s, in folly wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Alive to all the bli&s;s that he denies,</L>
<L>Worthy your laughter or perhaps your tears,</L>
<L>Brain-&s;ick of errors pa&s;t, to night appears</L>
<L>A moody mortal; &s;ketch'd on this mad plan;</L>
<L>A &s;urly mi&s;anthrope, and yet a man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within his orbit other beings move;</L>
<L>Some urg'd by av'rice, others &s;purr'd by love,</L>
<L>To aid or injure him, as pa&s;&s;ion drives;</L>
<L>The wor&s;t of &s;ervants; and the be&s;t of wives:</L>
<L>With many more, all waiting here within;</L>
<L>My ta&s;k being ended, ready to begin.</L>
<L>Hear, and decide, like men who think and feel:</L>
<L>For, from this night's decree, there's no appeal.</L>
