<P>OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND,</HI> RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY ADDINGTON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH your inquiries and pur|&s;uits have always been of a much higher nature than the &s;ubject of the&s;e papers, yet I take the liberty of pre|&s;enting them to you, as I am per&s;uaded you do not di&s;approve in others, what the rigid economy of your own time will not &s;uffer you to pur&s;ue with much attention your&s;elf.</P>
<P>My book would gladly, however, &s;till offer it&s;elf to your notice, from &s;ome little per&s;onal affinity. It de|&s;cribes a country, through which you
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
have often travelled; and in which your property chiefly lies.</P>
<P>But if this plea have le&s;s weight, it hath one more, from whieh it hath a better hope of procuring a favourable reception. The profits of it are in|tended to lay the foundation of a little fund, which you, my dear Sir, and a few other kind friends, have obligingly engaged to countenance at &s;ome future period.</P>
<P>As to the book it&s;elf, it has lain by me the&s;e twenty years, in which time it ought to have gained&mdash;and I hope it has gained&mdash;&s;ome little advantage. One advantage is, that I have had op|portunities of adorning &s;everal of the &s;cenes it de&s;cribes, with contra&s;ts taken from other countries, which have oc|ca&s;ionally fallen in my way. It was always a particular amu&s;ement to my|&s;elf,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
and I hope it may be al&s;o to others, to &s;ee how <HI>variou&s;ly</HI> Nature works up the <HI>&s;ame modes</HI> of &s;cenery, in different parts of the world.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, &s;o long a date hath occa&s;ioned &s;ome little anachroni&s;ms. I met with a few improvements in differ|ent places, of later date than the body of the work it&s;elf. The&s;e indeed I might have in&s;erted in notes; but I thought the occa&s;ion did not require much chronological exactne&s;s, and therefore blended them with the text.</P>
<P>After all, my dear Sir, to tell you the plain truth, in my addre&s;s to you, I con&s;ider my book only as a vehicle. The fact is, I had the vanity to wi&s;h it known, that I could call one of the mo&s;t amiable and re&s;pectable men I am acquainted with, my friend: and I hope you will excu&s;e my not commu|nicating
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
to you this piece of vanity, as I had determined to indulge what I feared you might wi&s;h to repre&s;s.</P>
<P>I beg, dear Sir, you will believe me to be, with the true&s;t e&s;teem, re&s;pect, and affection,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient, and obliged humble &s;ervant, WILL. GILPIN.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE <HI>WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>OUR road led us fir&s;t to Ep&s;om through Non&s;uch-park. The very ve&s;tiges of the &s;plendid palace and &s;umptuous gardens of Non&s;uch, where Henry VIII. and Elizabeth held their royal revelries, cannot now be traced; except here and there, in the form of a canal, or a terrace. Impre&s;&s;ions made upon the <HI>ground it&s;elf,</HI> are commonly more la&s;ting than any of the <HI>works of art,</HI> which are con|&s;tructed on its &s;urface. They are generally more enormous; and the materials of no value. Thus we have numberle&s;s tumuli&mdash;intrench|ments &mdash;mounds&mdash;and ditches, of Roman and Saxon con&s;truction, which will probably &s;ee as many ages as they have already &s;een: while
<PB N="2" REF="17">
the architectural remains of tho&s;e nations are either gone, or falling fa&s;t into ruin. The ruin however of Non&s;uch had an earlier date than happens to mo&s;t great hou&s;es. The pru|dent fore&s;ight of the duche&s;s of Cleveland, to whom Charles II. pre&s;ented it, was the cau&s;e of its &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. She feared a re|&s;umption, and pulling it in pieces, &s;old the materials. It is &s;omewhat remarkable that her father, Lord Francis Villiers, one of the hand|&s;ome&s;t men of his time, was killed, in the pre|ceding reign, in a &s;kirmi&s;h with a party of Cromwell's forces, on this very &s;pot.</P>
<P>But though the building of Non&s;uch was &s;plendid, and the gardens &s;umptuous beyond any of the royal hou&s;es of that time, the &s;itu|ation has little merit. At this day, a &s;itu|ation is generally the fir&s;t point attended to, as indeed it ought, in building a grand hou&s;e; but formerly the very wor&s;t &s;ituations &s;eem to have been cho&s;en; as if on purpo&s;e to &s;hew the tri|umphs of art over nature. Indeed our an|ce&s;tors had little ta&s;te for the beauties of na|ture; but conceived beauty to re&s;ide chiefly in the expen&s;ive conceits and extravagances of art; in which this palace particularly abounded. The body of the edifice formerly &s;tood in a
<PB N="3" REF="18">
field, acro&s;s the road, oppo&s;ite to a little farm, now known by the name of the <HI>Cherry-gar|den.</HI> If it had been carried a quarter of a mile higher, where a detached building appendant upon it, called the <HI>banqueting-room,</HI> formerly &s;tood, its &s;ituation would have been much bet|ter. It might have commanded a view over a country, which is in &s;ome parts plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Of the numerous appendages of this &s;ump|tuous pile, nothing remains but a hou&s;e, now modernized, which is &s;aid to have been formerly the habitation of Queen Elizabeth's maids of honour. In the garden was a large chalk-pit, containing about an acre of ground, which has been planted, and formed into a plea&s;ing little &s;eque&s;tered &s;cene by Mr. Whately, late &s;ecre|tary to the trea&s;ury, who wrote <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Modern Gardening.</HI> His brother now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that e&s;tate, which was formerly the deme&s;ne of the palace.</P>
<P>From Non&s;uch we pa&s;s through Ewel to Ep&s;om. Ewel is chiefly remarkable for a co|pious &s;pring of limpid water, which ari&s;ing in &s;everal parts of the village, forms it&s;elf into a
<PB N="4" REF="19">
con&s;iderable &s;tream. The baths collected from it, are chill, and pure in a great degree. Ep|&s;om hath been de&s;cribed by the pen of Toland; who exerci&s;ed the powers of a wan|ton imagination with more innocence on this &s;ubject, than on many others. All that can now be &s;aid of it with truth (and it is <HI>now</HI> much improved &s;ince the days of Toland) is, that it is a large plea&s;ant village, built in the form of a cre&s;cent, in an open country; and that it contains a few elegant hou&s;es. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable is a hou&s;e belonging to the late Lord Baltimore; though it is now neglected, and the park thrown into farms.</P>
<P>The chief recommendation of Ep&s;om, is its &s;ituation on the &s;kirts of that open country, called Ban&s;tead-downs, celebrated for hunting, racing, cricket-matches, and mutton. The&s;e downs con&s;i&s;t of beautiful &s;weeps of inter&s;ecting grounds; disfigured indeed here and there by a chalky &s;oil, but adorned with rich and very picture&s;que di&s;tances.</P>
<P>On the&s;e downs &s;tands a hunting-&s;eat of Lord Derby's, called the <HI>Oaks;</HI> which that no|bleman
<PB N="5" REF="20">
brought into repute (for it was for|merly an inn) by a very expen&s;ive &s;ummer-evening entertainment, which he gave upon his marriage. General Burgoyne celebrated both the place and the occa&s;ion, in a &s;mall dramatic piece, called the <HI>Maid of the Oaks.</HI></P>
<P>Though this little villa is whim&s;ical and &s;in|gular, it has its beauty. It commands about twenty acres, in an oblong form. In the cen|tre &s;tands the hou&s;e, which is a kind of tower; but yet unfini&s;hed. One half of the ground is laid out in clo&s;e walks, winding among <HI>oaks,</HI> from whence the place has its name: the other is a hanging lawn, inter&s;per&s;ed with fir, flow|ering &s;hrubs, and beeches. The oaks are or|dinary; and the firs &s;carcely yet half-grown; but &s;ome of the beeches are of the grande&s;t form. The whole is &s;urrounded by a &s;unk fence; and like an inchanted i&s;land in a de&s;ert, appears a beautiful &s;pot from every part of the downs in its neighbourhood; and has it&s;elf a grand view over them, as far as the towers of London.</P>
<P>From Ep&s;om we proceeded to Leatherhead, &s;kirting Lord Suffolk's park at A&s;hted: which
<PB N="6" REF="21">
is a plea&s;ant &s;cene, including a great variety of ground, and &s;ome fine oaks and elms, within a walled circumference of about two miles. The hou&s;e is not grand; but compact, and com|fortable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hou&s;e is now rebuilt. Sir Robert Howard, in Charles the Second's time, was the architect of the old hou&s;e, which I thought, having often &s;een it, a very good one.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AT Leatherhead, in&s;tead of continuing along the great road to Guilford, we turned &s;hort on the left, to take a view of Mr. Lock's hou&s;e at Norbury-park; which &s;tands about half-way between that town and Dork|ing, on the banks of the Mole. Nothing in the&s;e parts is &s;o well worth a traveller's at|tention.</P>
<P>The beauties of the Mole it&s;elf de&s;erve but little commendation. It is a lazy &s;tream; and &s;inking into the ground in &s;ome places, leaves its channel dry, in droughty &s;ea&s;ons. Its banks, however, are beautiful in various parts; but in no part more &s;o than where Mr. Lock's woods and lawns ri&s;e loftily above them.</P>
<P>On entering the gate from the road, and pa&s;&s;|ing the Mole, we wind round the hill on the right towards the hou&s;e, which &s;tands on the
<PB N="8" REF="23">
&s;ummit, removed from the &s;ight, as we ap|proach it; though from various parts of the country it is a con&s;picuous object.</P>
<P>Among other wood, which adorns this a&s;|cent, is a profu&s;ion of box. This plant grows here in full luxuriance, in its native unculti|vated &s;tate; marking the road on the right with great beauty. A regular clipt box-wood hedge is an object of deformity: but growing wildly, as it does here, and winding irregu|larly, at different di&s;tances, along the road, it is very ornamental. The box it&s;elf al&s;o is a plea&s;ing object: in winter it harmonizes with the ground; and, in &s;ummer, with the woods, which &s;urround it. Box has a mellower, a more varied, and a more accommodating tint, than any ever-green. One other circum&s;tance of advantage attends it. Almo&s;t every &s;pecies of &s;hrub, in a few years, outgrows its beauty. If the knife be not freely and frequently u&s;ed, it becomes bare at the bottom; its branches di&s;part, and it rambles into a form too diffu&s;e for its &s;tation. But box-wood long pre&s;erves its &s;hape: and in the wild &s;tate in which we found it here, is far from regular; though its branches, which are never large, are clo&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="24">
and compact. I &s;hould, however, mention holly, as having all the picture&s;que qualities of box, except the variety of its tints. But in the room of the&s;e it throws out its beautiful clu&s;ters of coral berries, which have a plea&s;ing effect among its dark green poli&s;hed leaves. Like box it grows &s;lowly, and alters lei&s;urely.</P>
<P>After winding about a mile up the hill, we arrive at the hou&s;e, which is encircled with groves of lofty, full-grown beech. The <HI>back-front</HI> (if I may be allowed an awk|ward expre&s;&s;ion for want of a better) over|hangs the &s;teep part of the hill; and com|mands, as you &s;urvey it from the windows of the hou&s;e, a very grand vale; not like the winding rocky vales of a mountainous coun|try, but &s;uch as we &s;ometimes find (though rarely on &s;o ample a &s;cale) among the downy hills of a chalky &s;oil; though here the chalk rarely offends. This vale is a flat area of cul|tivated ground, about five or &s;ix miles in length, and one in breadth. Sometimes in|deed, though but rarely, it takes the form of a lake or bay of the &s;ea; which it exactly re&s;em|bles when it happens to be over&s;pread by a thick white fog, &s;uch a fog as from its gravity,
<PB N="10" REF="25">
and the want of air to di&s;turb it, &s;inks to a level like water; and like water al&s;o de&s;cribes the prominences of the vale around the ba&s;es of the hills.</P>
<P>Generally indeed the&s;e heavy fogs are mi&s;|chievous, when they float over &s;ea-mar&s;hes, and other moi&s;t lands. A gentleman once fitted up a hou&s;e near the coa&s;t of Suffolk, which was often &s;ubject to them. It &s;tood on a &s;mall eminence, in the mid&s;t of a rich woody vale; the whole &s;urrounded by hills. Here the fogs would &s;ometimes appear, in an au|tumnal evening, winding along the vale like a river, and &s;ometimes like a lake; not with that indi&s;tinct and vapouri&s;h &s;urface which fogs commonly a&s;&s;ume, but flat, clear, and tran&s;|parent; forming di&s;tinctly all tho&s;e little in|dentations which a water-line would have de|&s;cribed. The&s;e beautiful exhibitions, though frequently pre&s;ented, never failed to plea&s;e. In the mean time the family were all &s;eized with agues, fevers, and bilious di&s;orders; and in three years found out, that the&s;e beautiful fogs were the cau&s;e of their complaints. When the ma&s;ter of the &s;cene therefore had ju&s;t gotten his hou&s;e and grounds completed, he was con&s;trained to leave them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="26">Norbury park, however, is not &s;ubject to this beautiful mi&s;chief. It is but rarely that its vale is thus filled with a &s;leeping fog; and when it is, the hou&s;e &s;tands &s;o proudly above it, that it de&s;pi&s;es its bad effects.</P>
<P>The &s;ide-&s;creen of this vale, on the right, as you &s;till &s;urvey it from the windows, con&s;i&s;ts of a downy hill, marked with various large ir|regular channels, and planted with ancient oak and beech. Through the&s;e woods, a walk is conducted along its &s;loping &s;ide; from whence you have de&s;cending views into the vale be|low: &s;ome of which &s;een through the &s;pread|ing arms of an oak or a beech, as through the frame of a picture, have a plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>The other &s;ide-&s;creen of the vale con&s;i&s;ts of that boa&s;t of Surrey, the celebrated Box-hill; &s;o called from the profu&s;ion of box which flouri&s;hes &s;pontaneou&s;ly upon it. This hill, from its downy back and precipitous &s;ides, ex|hibits great variety of plea&s;ing views into the lower parts of Surrey; and the higher parts of the neighbouring counties. But we have here only to do with it, as it&s;elf an object in a retir|ing &s;cene; in which it fills its &s;tation with great beauty; di&s;covering its &s;hivering preci|pices, and downy hillocks, every where inter|&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="27">
with the mellow verdure of box, which is here and there tinged, as box commonly is, with red and orange.</P>
<P>This hill, and the neighbouring hills, on which this beautiful plant flouri&s;hes in &s;uch profu&s;ion, &s;hould be con&s;idered as making a part of the natural hi&s;tory of Britain. A&s;&s;er, in his Life of Alfred the Great, tells us, that Berk&s;hire had its name from a wood, <HI>ubi buxus abundanti&s;&s;im&egrave; na&s;citur.</HI> No trace of any &s;uch wood now remains: nor is there perhaps a &s;ingle bu&s;h of indigenous box to be found in the whole country. All has been rooted up by the plough. If it were not therefore for the growth of box on the Surrey hills, who&s;e precipitous &s;ides refu&s;e cultivation, it might perhaps be doubted, whether box were a na|tive of England. As to the common tradition of the country, that it was planted by an earl of Arundel, it is certainly fabulous: for there are court rolls &s;till exi&s;ting, which mention <HI>the box-wood on the hill,</HI> before any &s;uch artificial plantation could have taken place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;ignificant as this &s;hrub appears, it has been to its owner, Sir Henry Mildmay, a &s;ource of con&s;iderable profit. It is u&s;ed chiefly in turning. But the &s;hips from the Levant brought &s;uch quantities of it in balla&s;t, that the wood on the hill could not find a purcha&s;er; and not having been cut in 65 years, was growing in many parts cankered. But the war having dimini&s;hed the in|flux of it from the Mediterranean, &s;everal purcha&s;ers began to offer: and in the year 1795 Sir Henry put it up to auction; and &s;old it for the immen&s;e &s;um of twelve thou&s;and pounds. Box at|tains its full growth in about fifty years; in which time, if the &s;oil be good, it will ri&s;e fifteen feet, and form a &s;tem of the thick|ne&s;s of a man's thigh. The depredations made on Box hill, in con&s;equence of this &s;ale, will not much injure its picture&s;que beauty; as it will be twelve years in cutting, which will give each portion a rea&s;onable time to renew its beauty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="28">The end-&s;creen which &s;huts in the beautiful vale ju&s;t de&s;cribed, con&s;i&s;ts of the range of hills beyond Dorking; and the ri&s;ing grounds of Deepden; where in a clear day, a new hou&s;e, built by the Duke of Norfolk, makes a con|&s;picuous object. A little to the left of Dork|ing hills, the high grounds gradually falling, admit a di&s;tant catch of the South downs, which overhang the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation of this elegant villa; though, like all other &s;ituations, it hath its fa|vourable and unfavourable lights. It is &s;een to mo&s;t advantage in an evening. As the vale points almo&s;t directly &s;outh from the hou&s;e, the we&s;t is on the right. In the evening therefore the woods of that &s;creen are all in
<PB N="14" REF="29">
&s;hadow, which is flung in one va&s;t ma&s;s over the bo&s;om of the vale: while the &s;etting &s;un, having ju&s;t touched the tops of the trees, as its rays pa&s;s over, throws a beautiful light on the guttered &s;ides of Box-hill.</P>
<P>This view over the vale, (beautiful as it is,) is &s;ubject, however, to inconvenience. Every hou&s;e &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, overlook its <HI>own do|mains,</HI> as far at lea&s;t as to remote di&s;tance. All the intermediate &s;pace, in which objects are &s;een more di&s;tinctly, may &s;uffer great injury from the caprice of different proprietors: and, in fact, this view has, in two or three in&s;tances, &s;uffered injury from the interference of neigh|bours. This is indeed one rea&s;on, among others, why noble palaces, with exten&s;ive pro|perty on every &s;ide, are mo&s;t adapted to the&s;e commanding &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Norbury-hou&s;e pretends only to comfort and convenience; except in the drawing room, which is an object of great curio&s;ity. It is an oblong of 30 feet by 24. The walls are co|vered with a hard and durable &s;tucco, and are painted by Barret. The whole room repre|&s;ents a bower or arbour, admitting a <HI>fictitious</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="30">
&s;ky through a large oval at the top, and co|vered at the angles with trellis-work, inter|woven with honey-&s;uckles, vines, clu&s;tering grapes, and flowering creepers of various kinds. The &s;ides of the room are divided by &s;light painted pila&s;ters, appearing to &s;upport the trel|lis roof; and open to four views. That to|wards the <HI>&s;outh</HI> is <HI>real,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the vale inclo&s;ed by Box-hill, and the hills of Norbury, and Dorking, which hath been ju&s;t de&s;cribed. The other three are <HI>artificial.</HI> Two of them, which are the two end-views, cover the whole &s;ides of the room from the ceiling to the ba&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;cene pre&s;ented on the <HI>we&s;t</HI> wall, is taken from the lakes of Cumberland. It is an exact portrait of none of them; but a land|&s;cape formed from a collection of &s;ome of the happie&s;t circum&s;tances which belong to all. No real view could pre&s;ent &s;o beautiful and complete a picture. A large portion of the lake, under a &s;plendid calm, is &s;pread before the eye, &s;urrounded by mountains perfectly well &s;haped and &s;tationed. Nature is not very nice in the moulds in which &s;he commonly ca&s;ts the&s;e enormous bodies; and as they have
<PB N="16" REF="31">
various forms of beauty, &s;o have they of de|formity; but here we have &s;ome of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;hapes culled out, and beautifully grouped. Woods are &s;cattered about every part, which give the&s;e &s;cenes a greater richne&s;s than nature hath given to any of the lakes in Cumberland. The &s;maller ornaments al&s;o of buildings, figures, and boats are judiciou&s;ly introduced, and have a good effect. All this &s;cenery is contained in various removes of di&s;|tance; for no part of the lake comes clo&s;e to the eye. The near ground is compo&s;ed of bold rocks, and other rough &s;urfaces, with which the banks of lakes commonly abound. Among the&s;e a wild torrent, variou&s;ly broken, pours its waters under the &s;urba&s;e of the room, which intercepts it. This torrent the painter has managed &s;o well, that its &s;pirit and brilliancy produce no lights which interfere with the calm re&s;plendency of the lake, but rather con|tra&s;t it.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing this noble land&s;cape, I have thus far con&s;idered it chiefly as a <HI>whole.</HI> But all its <HI>parts</HI> are equally excellent. On the fore|ground particularly are two birch-trees, which are painted with great beauty. The roots, the bark, and the foliage, are all admirable.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="32">The other grand land&s;cape occupies the <HI>ea&s;t|ern</HI> wall of the room. It is, I think, inferior to that on the <HI>we&s;t;</HI> yet it is a noble work. The &s;cene is &s;ylvan, and the objects of cour&s;e le&s;s grand. The foreground, where we admire particularly &s;ome beautiful trees, is tumbled about in various forms; but in the di&s;tance it &s;inks into a rich flat country, through which a &s;luggi&s;h &s;tream, winding its cour&s;e, di&s;|charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea. The &s;ame ob&s;erv|ations might be made on this picture, which were made on the other, with regard to com|po&s;ition, and the judicious management of the &s;everal parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>north</HI> &s;ide of the room, oppo&s;ite to the windows, offers two more land&s;capes; divided by the brea&s;t of the chimney; which is adorned with a pier-gla&s;s, let into the wall, and covered thick with a frame-work of ho|ney-&s;uckles, vines, wild-ro&s;es, and various creepers in flower; all painted with great beauty. The&s;e two pictures on the <HI>north</HI> are a continuation of the &s;cene exhibited on the we&s;tern wall, which they unite with the land|&s;cape on the <HI>ea&s;t.</HI> Clu&s;tering vines, and wild flowers, form a frame-work to all the&s;e beauti|ful pictures, both at the ba&s;e, and along the
<PB N="18" REF="33">
trellis-work of the &s;ides; &s;o as to give them the re&s;emblance of being &s;een through the openings of the arbour.</P>
<P>With this <HI>unity in the &s;ubjects</HI> of the&s;e land|&s;capes, the <HI>light</HI> al&s;o, and other <HI>particulars</HI> co|incide. The <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> repre&s;ented, is autumn. Every where round the room the year is in its wane. Each tree, and bu&s;h, is touched with its autumnal hue. The <HI>time of the day</HI> is about an hour before the &s;un &s;ets, which, after a rainy afternoon, is breaking out from the wa|tery clouds that are &s;cattered before a gentle breeze, in too high a region of the air to affect the &s;urface of the lake. The rainy clouds, which are broken in the <HI>we&s;t,</HI> hang heavy in the north; and give a dark lurid tint to the lake below. In the <HI>north-ea&s;t angle,</HI> a ray of &s;un&s;hine, breaking through the gloom, gilds a ca&s;tled cliff: but the clouds conden&s;ing again, fall in a heavy, though a partial &s;hower on the land&s;cape in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>As the &s;un is repre&s;ented &s;etting on the <HI>we&s;t|ern</HI> &s;ide of the room, it is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to illumine the &s;everal objects in <HI>all</HI> the pictures; and when the <HI>natural hour</HI> corre&s;ponds with the <HI>hour repre&s;ented,</HI> there is a coincidence of <HI>arti|ficial</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> light. All the land&s;cape,
<PB N="19" REF="34">
both within and without the room, appears illumined by the &s;ame &s;un. The union too between the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>artificial</HI> land&s;cape, is &s;till farther a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a few &s;traggling trees, which are planted before the windows, with a view to connect the picture with the <HI>country.</HI></P>
<P>We dwell the longer on this curious and in|tere&s;ting room, as it is the only one of the kind perhaps in England. There is a room painted by the celebrated Ga&s;per Pou&s;&s;in, at the villa of Monte Dragone, near Rome, on a plan &s;ome|thing like this; but Ga&s;per has paid no atten|tion to the union of the &s;everal <HI>lights,</HI> nor to the <HI>characteri&s;tic agreement</HI> of the &s;everal views.</P>
<P>Added to the hou&s;e is another grand room, full of much curio&s;ity. It was built by Mr. Lock, as a painting room for the amu&s;ement of his elde&s;t &s;on, who&s;e genius, ta&s;te, and know|ledge in painting contend with our be&s;t arti&s;ts. This room is adorned with a rich collection of &s;tatues, models, ca&s;ts, and bas-reliefs; all ex|cellent in their kind: and an adjoining clo&s;et is filled with heads, hands, feet, trunks, and other parts of the human body; &s;o that the whole together is a complete &s;tudy for a painter.</P>
<P>Among the ca&s;ts is a very fine one of the Venus of Medici. It is not common to &s;ee &s;o
<PB N="20" REF="35">
good a &s;ub&s;titute of this figure. I have &s;ome|times heard her <HI>attitude</HI> called in que&s;tion. In|&s;tead of that mode&s;t demeanor, which is com|monly a&s;cribed to her, I have known her re|proached for prudery, and theatrical affecta|tion. We can, in truth, &s;ay but little for her moral character. Her <HI>attitude,</HI> however, I think may be defended. The &s;culptor, I &s;up|po&s;e, meant her to be viewed with her face to|wards you. In that po&s;ition &s;he makes the mo&s;t elegant figure.
<Q><L>&mdash;Shrunk from her&s;elf,</L>
<L>With fancy blu&s;hing,&mdash;</L></Q>
&s;he received the &s;hot of the prophane eye that &s;urpri&s;ed her, as our modern heroes in duel|ling receive a bullet, by in&s;tantly drawing her body into a profile. In both ca&s;es nature teaches the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t commodious po&s;|ture.</P>
<P>But this collection, though it con&s;i&s;t chiefly of ca&s;ts, contains &s;ome genuine antiques; par|ticularly a Di&s;cobolus, which is e&s;teemed, I be|lieve, the fir&s;t &s;tatue in England. It turns on a pivot; and exhibits (what few &s;tatues are able to exhibit) <HI>on every &s;ide</HI> the ju&s;te&s;t propor|tions and the mo&s;t plea&s;ing attitudes. But
<PB N="21" REF="36">
what chiefly engages the attention in this &s;ta|tue, is its <HI>expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> It is a great beauty in any figure to appear to have &s;ome object in view, which always gives animation to it. I mean not that &s;trong degree of action, which the ancient ma&s;ters &s;ometimes gave their figures; as in the Laocoon, the fighting gladia|tor, and the Tor&s;o, as far as we may judge of that fragment from the &s;welling of the mu&s;cles. <HI>Strong expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> no doubt, is highly beautiful, when it is well executed. But I would here only ob&s;erve the effect of &s;ome <HI>ea&s;y action,</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to <HI>none at all;</HI> as in the Venus, the Belvidere Apollo, the li&s;|tening Slave, or the Farne&s;ian Hercules, re&s;t|ing from one of his labours. All the&s;e gentle modes of <HI>action</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> are certainly much more beautiful than the unintere&s;ting vacancy of a con&s;ul &s;tanding erect in his robes. Intere&s;ting he &s;till may be, all I contend for is, that &s;uch a &s;tatue is not <HI>&s;o</HI> intere&s;ting as if it had &s;ome object in view. The Di&s;cobolus be|fore us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this beauty in a di&s;tingui&s;hed manner. He has ju&s;t delivered his quoit; and with an eager eye, and right arm &s;till ex|tended, is watching its &s;ucce&s;s. The expanded hand indicates, that the mind is yet in &s;u&s;|pence
<PB N="22" REF="37">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The right hand, in this &s;tatue, is modern; but there is a repetition of this figure in the Mu&s;aeum Clementinum at Rome, which &s;hews, I am informed, the hand to have been well copied.</NOTE>. His left hand holds another quoit; as, I &s;uppo&s;e, each Di&s;cobolus had two. It is pro|bable, however, the &s;tatuary might have di&s;|po&s;ed the left hand to more advantage, if he could have de&s;cribed a quoit flying through the air. But he thought it nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome way to &s;hew in what mode of action his figure was engaged. Nature could not have told the &s;tory with more expre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This &s;tatue is now in the hands of Mr. Duncombe of York&s;hire, who purcha&s;ed it of Mr. Lock.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the &s;tatuary has generally a &s;ingle figure only to manage, there is much artifice nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew who he is; or, if he be employed, what he is about; and &s;ometimes this is done very awkwardly. We might produce many in&s;tances; but few perhaps more remarkable than M. Angelo's celebrated &s;tatue of Mo&s;es. Unle&s;s the original greatly exceed any of the copies we have of it, it certainly de&s;erves le&s;s prai&s;e than it has found. The face is incum|bered with beard, and the body with drapery. But what I mean to remark at pre&s;ent is, the conceit with which the &s;tatuary has <HI>charac|terized</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="38">
Mo&s;es. Some &s;ymbol was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h him from a Roman con&s;ul, &s;itting in his curule chair. M. Angelo has given him <HI>horns,</HI> by which he has turned him into a &s;atyr. From whatever &s;illy conceit the <HI>idea</HI> of giving horns to the great Jewi&s;h lawgiver originally &s;prang, it is certainly ab&s;urd in the la&s;t degree, to &s;ee that <HI>idea realized in marble.</HI> How much better might Mo&s;es have been cha|racterized &s;imply by his <HI>rod,</HI> and the <HI>two tables of the covenant;</HI> which latter, well managed, might have made a broad contra&s;t with the drapery, while in part they might have been covered with it.</P>
<P>Among &s;o many copies from the antique, it is difficult to forbear remarking, that the hair in &s;ome of them is very awkwardly expre&s;&s;ed. I have the Laocoon particularly in view. The hair and beard of this &s;tatue have an uncom|monly bad effect; for as the face is turned from the eye, the locks of hair, which are in round curls, are confounded with the features them&s;elves, pre&s;enting a number of &s;mall cavi|ties, who&s;e dark &s;hadows dimini&s;h the effect of tho&s;e in the no&s;trils, mouth, and eyes, which &s;hould give character and expre&s;&s;ion to the face. It is a difficult thing, no doubt, to give
<PB N="24" REF="39">
the ea&s;e of hair to a block of marble: yet it may be done in two ways. We have exam|ples of both. The hair may be repre&s;ented very &s;hort, ju&s;t covering the head, approach|ing nearly to baldne&s;s, as we often &s;ee it ex|pre&s;&s;ed; or it may be repre&s;ented in an ea&s;y flow. This is more difficult; yet we &s;ome|times &s;ee it well executed; and when it is &s;o, it is certainly more beautiful than to expre&s;s the hair in &s;mall ringlets, as it is in the Lao|coon, and in many other antiques.</P>
<P>Before we leave this room, I cannot forbear mentioning a head, which has a place there, with hair of another kind. It plainly indeed appeared allied neither to the Greek nor Ro|man models, among which it &s;tood, (for the mouth was frightfully bad,) yet the <HI>upper part</HI> of the face was executed with &s;implicity, and had &s;omething in it like ta&s;te and beauty. On inquiry we found it was a great curio&s;ity, being the workman&s;hip of a native of Otaheite; and &s;eemed a convincing proof, that a love for the imitative arts is innate. But what particularly &s;truck us in this head, was its being adorned with <HI>real hair,</HI> which had a &s;till wor&s;e effect than the beard of Laocoon. The mixture in|deed of <HI>reality</HI> and <HI>imitation,</HI> is very di&s;gu&s;ting;
<PB N="25" REF="40">
and I doubt not would have appeared &s;o on a little more knowledge and experience, to the ingenious &s;culptor of the head him&s;elf. But we need not wonder at &s;uch ab&s;urdity in an arti&s;t of Otaheite, when we &s;ee among our|&s;elves &s;o many &s;hocking &s;tatues, <HI>painted after the life;</HI> and vile waxen images with wigs and drapery; things to &s;hudder at, rather than to admire. The plain marble makes no pre|tence to any thing but <HI>imitation.</HI> It means not to put a <HI>trick</HI> upon us, by &s;ub&s;tituting it&s;elf for <HI>real life.</HI> But when we look at a waxen figure, arrayed in <HI>real drapery;</HI> yet with <HI>rigid limbs,</HI> and <HI>glazed</HI> and <HI>motionle&s;s eyes;</HI> that is, with every appearance of life about it but mo|tion, in which the very e&s;&s;ence of life con&s;i&s;ts, we are &s;hocked. The fact is, that when the <HI>art of imitation</HI> (applied to human life) is &s;o perfect as to produce a <HI>real,</HI> though <HI>momentary illu&s;ion,</HI> it pre&s;ents, by its <HI>near approach to life,</HI> an image of <HI>death.</HI> For the in&s;tant we per|ceive that a figure of this kind wants motion, we pur&s;ue it to the next &s;tage, where motion cea&s;es, which is <HI>death.</HI> A <HI>repre&s;entation of a dead body</HI> may be beautiful and plea&s;ing; but a figure which pre&s;ents you with the appear|ance
<PB N="26" REF="41">
of death, when you expected life, not only di&s;gu&s;ts you by the &s;uddenne&s;s of the tran|&s;ition; but al&s;o from the mind's having been even for a moment impo&s;ed on by &s;o paltry a trick.</P>
<P>From &s;uch effects, therefore, it &s;eems to fol|low, that an <HI>art calculated to plea&s;e by an imita|tion of life,</HI> &s;hould, when applied to the human figure, though <HI>nece&s;&s;arily imperfect,</HI> be made <HI>intentionally</HI> more &s;o; le&s;t by too near an ap|proach to <HI>life,</HI> it &s;hould &s;hock us with the idea of <HI>death.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;hock which the&s;e repre&s;ent|ations give to the &s;en&s;es, they gro&s;sly oppo&s;e every idea of ta&s;te. When we &s;ee a &s;tuffed &s;kin in a Mu&s;eum, we expect only an object of curio&s;ity, and are &s;atisfied. But when a thing of this kind is &s;hewn as an <HI>object of beauty,</HI> it &s;ets all ta&s;te (which in natural objects &s;eeks for nature) at defiance; and we con&s;ider a mummy, which aims at nothing but what it is, by many degrees the more re&s;pectable figure.</P>
<P>As we leave this elegant man&s;ion and de&s;cend the hill, the views are more <HI>picture&s;que</HI> than tho&s;e over the valley from the back-front. They con&s;i&s;t of oblique &s;weeps of de&s;cending
<PB N="27" REF="42">
fore-grounds, every where well-wooded, and &s;et off with remote di&s;tances. This is the <HI>&s;im|ple&s;t mode of land&s;cape;</HI> but where the fore-ground and di&s;tances are good, though there is a &s;trong oppo&s;ition between them, they are not unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>A little to the right, as we de&s;cend from the hou&s;e, the beech-woods, con&s;i&s;ting of lofty full-grown trees, &s;weep down to the vale; though in le&s;s luxuriance, as they gradually de&s;cend. When the de&s;cent becomes precipitous, the channelled &s;ides of the hill are, in many parts, bare of vegetation, and di&s;cover the &s;oil, which is not chalk, though of a chalky tendency, and rather grey than white. Patches of earth are mixed with the&s;e patches of barren &s;oil, in which box-wood grows profu&s;ely; and here and there, where the &s;oil allows, a luxuriant beech. Down this hill an Alpine road winds into the vale, and adds much to its beauty and character. It is &s;till rendered more inte|re&s;ting by opening, in various parts, towards Box-hill; which pre&s;ents its flanks in the&s;e partial views, with a very mountain-like ap|pearance. The whole &s;cene makes a good Alpine picture.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="43">Our remarks on this place &s;hould have been more cur&s;ory, if the plan of the whole, the &s;ituation, and the embelli&s;hments of it had not been all uncommon.

<P>FROM Norbury-park we returned to Lea|therhead, and pa&s;&s;ed the Mole again in our way to Guildford. The country on the left con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of open downs, which are ra|ther narrow in this part, as they are drawing to a point. They are inter&s;per&s;ed al&s;o with plots of cultivation. As the&s;e downs are generally high, we had, from many parts of them, a va|riety of beautiful di&s;tances on the right; not &s;o expan&s;ive as tho&s;e from Ban&s;tead-downs; but more picture&s;que, as they are more within the command of the eye. The great beauty of &s;uch &s;cenes con&s;i&s;ts in the richne&s;s of their parts, in the removal of one di&s;tance beyond another, di&s;coverable chiefly by lengthened gleams of light, and in the melting of the whole into the horizon. If a di&s;tance be de|prived of <HI>any</HI> of the&s;e characteri&s;tics, it is im|perfect; but the la&s;t is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary. A <HI>hard edge</HI> of di&s;tance checking the view, (which is often the ca&s;e when the di&s;|tance is not remote,) is exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ting.
<PB N="30" REF="45">
When the di&s;tance indeed is bounded by moun|tains, it falls under other rules of picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P>Of the elevated &s;ituation of the&s;e downs much advantage hath been taken. Many ele|gant hou&s;es are built upon the edge of them for the &s;ake of the various pro&s;pects they com|mand. The whole country indeed from Lea|therhead almo&s;t to Guildford is thus richly adorned. Two of the mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e villas, are tho&s;e belonging to the late Admiral Bo&s;cawen and Lord On&s;low. The latter is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t hou&s;es in Surrey. The grounds about it &s;eem well di&s;po&s;ed; but we only rode pa&s;t them.</P>
<P>A little to the left, near three parts of the way to Guildford, we were directed to look out, about half a mile from the road, for a beautiful &s;cene called the <HI>Sheep-leas;</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of lawns, divided from each other by woody cop&s;es. We ea&s;ily found it; and were much gratified with the appearance it pre&s;ented of a &s;imple Arcadian retreat.</P>
<P>Few parts of this adorned tract of country between Leatherhead and Guildford, (through a &s;pace of about eleven miles,) can be called pic|ture&s;que; yet from the variety it affords, it is
<PB N="31" REF="46">
very amu&s;ing. One of the great nui&s;ances of the land&s;cape here, as well as in other parts of the neighbourhood of London, is the formal manner which prevails of lopping trees, e&s;pe|cially elms. They are entirely deprived of the beautiful ramification of all their lateral branches, and you &s;ee them every where formed into mere poles, with a bu&s;h at the top. <HI>We</HI> con&s;idered them only as objects of deformity: but the <HI>&s;kilful woodman,</HI> I have heard, con&s;iders &s;uch mutilation as very detri|mental to the timber. One rea&s;on given for lopping the elm is, that it may be the better converted into a hollow trunk to convey water under ground. Elm is the wood chiefly u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, as it continues long &s;ound if it be kept from the air; but perhaps not one in fifty of the&s;e mutilated trees is converted to this u&s;e.</P>
<P>Guildford is a town both of antiquity and curio&s;ity; but is in no part picture&s;que. It con&s;i&s;ts of one long &s;treet, running down pre|cipitately to the river Wey; from whence the road on the other &s;ide ri&s;es &s;till more ab|ruptly
<PB N="32" REF="47">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has lately been much ea&s;ed.</NOTE>. In the highe&s;t part of the town &s;tands the ca&s;tle, which con&s;i&s;ts of a heavy tower, though in one or two points it is not unpicture&s;que. The Wey is navigable as far as Guildford; and beyond it, for timber, which is brought down the river from the contiguous parts of the country.</P>
<P>Floats of timber are among the plea&s;ing ap|pendages of a river, when the trunks are hap|pily di&s;po&s;ed. This di&s;po&s;ition, however, I fear, mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of chance, rather than of art. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to pack a float pic|ture&s;quely by de&s;ign. The&s;e cumbrous ma|chines are navigated each by a &s;ingle man with a pole; and as they glide gently down the &s;tream, the tremulous reflections they form on the &s;till &s;urface of the water, and their contra&s;t with trees, bu&s;hes, and pa&s;turage, as they float along, are plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>But cumbrous as the&s;e rafts are, they are as nothing compared with tho&s;e which are often floated down the Rhine. In the neighbourhood of Andernach, great quantities of timber, brought down by various &s;treams, from the fore&s;ts of Germany, are there con&s;tructed into
<PB N="33" REF="48">
a float of va&s;t dimen&s;ions. Some of the&s;e floats are a thou&s;and feet long, and ninety broad; and are each furni&s;hed with five hundred men. For the accommodation of &s;uch a company, a &s;treet of cabins is built upon the &s;urface of the float. When all is ready, and the &s;everal men are at their po&s;ts, (many of whom are in rafts and boats, both behind and before the float, to conduct it properly,) the pilot &s;tands up, and taking off his hat, with a loud voice cries out, "Let us pray:" on which the whole body of the workmen on board fall down on their knees, and beg a ble&s;&s;ing on the expedition. The anchors and cables are then drawn on board, and the whole machine is put in motion. As it &s;ails maje&s;tically down the Rhine, it draws all the inhabitants from the towns and villages on the banks of the river to &s;ee it pa&s;s, till it ar|rive at Dort in Holland, the place of its de&s;ti|nation; where being broken up, the &s;ale of its &s;everal parts continues many months, and rai&s;es often the &s;um of thirty thou&s;and pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a longer account of the&s;e floats in a very ingenious and entertaining work, intitled <Q>A Journey through Holland, &amp;c. by Anne Ratcliffe.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the&s;e timber floats we may add one of a very &s;ingular kind on the Nile, con&s;tructed of earthen ve&s;&s;els. Large jars, to pre&s;erve water
<PB N="34" REF="49">
in dry &s;ea&s;ons, are in great reque&s;t in many parts of Egypt. The&s;e, of various &s;izes, are manufactured chiefly in the clayey grounds of the upper parts of the country. When the potter has gotten a &s;ufficient number ready for market, he begins to form his float. In &s;ome convenient place near the river, he ranges his large&s;t jars, empty, but well-corked, in rows of a proper length and breadth. The&s;e he braces tight with flexible twigs: and with the &s;ame art ranges above them &s;everal tiers of &s;maller jars, till he has made up the quantity and kind of goods his market demands. Over all he con&s;tructs a &s;eat for him&s;elf. By this time the waters of the Nile, who&s;e increa&s;e he calculates, begin to ripple round his earthen raft, which is pre&s;ently after afloat. Hav|ing victualled it with a bag of parched rice, and put on his blue linen &s;hirt and cap, he takes his &s;eat, and paddles his ve&s;&s;el into the middle of the channel. The wondering &s;tranger eyes from the &s;hore this odd &s;pe|cies of navigation; and though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his pocket-per&s;pective, cannot conceive its con|&s;truction. In the mean time it glides down the &s;tream. Neither &s;torms nor rocks it fears, with which the Nile is little acquainted; and if
<PB N="35" REF="50">
it even touch the ground, its motion is &s;o gen|tle, and the ooze &s;o &s;oft, that its con&s;truction is not in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed. Nothing can be more ingenious than to make a cargo of heavy materials its own vehicle; at the &s;ame time, &s;uch a float could hardly be an object of beauty.</P>
<P>The elegant author of the <HI>Elegy in a Church|yard</HI> &s;eems to have had a float of this kind in his view, in the la&s;t lines of the following beau|tiful de&s;cription of the Nile.</P>

<L>The du&s;ky people drive before the gale;</L>

<P>From Guildford to Farnham the form of the country is &s;ingular. The road is carried through the &s;pace of eight miles, over a ridge of high ground with a &s;teep de&s;cent on each &s;ide. This grand natural terrace, which the country people call the <HI>Hog's back,</HI> pre&s;ents on each hand exten&s;ive di&s;tances. On the
<PB N="36" REF="51">
right the di&s;tance is very remote, con&s;i&s;ting of that flat country through which the Wey, the Mole, and the Thames, though none of them objects in the &s;cene, flow with almo&s;t imper|ceptible motion. On the left the di&s;tance is more broken with ri&s;ing grounds inter&s;per&s;ed through various parts of it.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;tance on neither hand forms a picture, except in a few places, for want of foregrounds and proper appendages pro|portioned to the &s;cene; yet on both &s;ides we &s;tudy a variety of tho&s;e plea&s;ing circum&s;tances, which we look for in remote land&s;cape. As we draw near the clo&s;e of this terrace, the two di&s;|tances unite in one, forming a kind of grand amphitheatre in front.</P>
<P>Such violent contra&s;ts as the&s;e, in which lofty grounds break down <HI>precipitately</HI> into exten&s;ive plains, are rather uncommon in nature, as the&s;e different modes of country are generally more imperceptibly united. We have &s;everal &s;cenes, however, of this kind in different parts of Eng|land; particularly in the view over the vale of Mowbray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Northern Tour, vol. ii. p. 191.</NOTE>; and in that over the vale of Se|vern <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Wye, p. 8.</NOTE>; in both which the union is abrupt.
<PB N="37" REF="52">
As England, however, is a country only on a &s;mall &s;cale, compared with the va&s;t tracts on the continent, its &s;cenes are more in miniature. Its rivers, its lakes, its mountains, and plains, though generally more picture&s;que, as more &s;uited to human vi&s;ion, yet do not &s;trike the imagination with &s;o much grandeur. Many in&s;tances might be brought from the continent of &s;ublimer effects in all modes of land&s;cape. A very abrupt tran&s;ition from the mo&s;t mag|nificent &s;ylvan &s;cenery to entire &s;terility, I met with lately in an account of the productions of Boutan and Thibet, communicated in the Phi|lo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. lxxix.</NOTE>. Where Boutan, &s;ays the author of tho&s;e remarks, joins the territory of Thibet, the boundary is marked by &s;uch a line, as is perhaps hardly to be &s;een in any other part of the earth. From the eminence where we &s;tood, the mountains of Boutan, which ranged above us, appeared every where beautifully arrayed in wood, mantling down to our very feet. This view was towards the &s;outh. When we turned towards the north, the eye is received by a va&s;t dreary wa&s;te, de|&s;cending far and wide, compo&s;ed of exten&s;ive
<PB N="38" REF="53">
ranges of hills and plains; but, from the woody &s;pot where we &s;tood, through the whole unbounded di&s;tance, there is not the lea&s;t ap|pearance of vegetation.</P>
<P>Farnham con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one long, tho|rough-fare &s;treet, and is principally remarkable for its being the &s;ummer-re&s;idence of the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Farnham-ca&s;tle &s;tands high, and was form|erly a fortre&s;s of con&s;iderable reputation. It was built by a Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter in the time of King Stephen, when ca&s;tles were much in fa&s;hion, and made &s;ome figure in the trou|bled reign of that prince. It afterwards figured in the times of Lewis the Dauphin, in the in|&s;urrections of the barons, and in the civil wars of the la&s;t century. During the&s;e la&s;t trou|bles it was blown up by Sir William Waller; though not with that <HI>picture&s;que judgment</HI> with which many ca&s;tles in tho&s;e times were demo|li&s;hed. Very little is left that can make a plea&s;|ing picture. After the re&s;toration it depo&s;ited its military character, and was changed again into an epi&s;copal palace by Bi&s;hop Morley; but it has ever &s;ince been neglected. The pre|&s;ent
<PB N="39" REF="54">
bi&s;hop is the fir&s;t who has paid any atten|tion, for many generations, to Farnham-ca&s;tle. He has greatly improved the hou&s;e, and has fitted it up in &s;uch a manner, as will probably make it an object to every future bi&s;hop. The keep, or inner ca&s;tle, is left &s;tanding in its ruins, and is &s;till a curious piece of antiquity. It is &s;urrounded by a deep ditch, which, toge|ther with the area of the ca&s;tle, containing about two acres, makes an excellent kitchen-garden.</P>
<P>Behind the hou&s;e extends a park, about four miles in circumference, which the bi&s;hop found as much neglected and out of order as the hou&s;e it&s;elf. It was cut with unlicen&s;ed paths, the trees were mangled to browze the deer, and a cricket ground had &s;o long been &s;uffered, that the people conceived they had now a right to it. This la&s;t was a great nui&s;ance. Such a &s;cene of riot and di&s;order, with &s;tands for &s;elling liquor, ju&s;t under the ca&s;tle windows, could not ea&s;ily be endured. The bi&s;hop took the gentle&s;t methods he could to remove the nui&s;ance; and at length, though not without &s;ome difficulty, got it effected.</P>
<P>Having thus removed nui&s;ances from his park, he began to embelli&s;h it. He improved
<PB N="40" REF="55">
the &s;urface, he laid out hand&s;ome roads and walks, he planted young trees, and protected the old trees from farther ill u&s;age.</P>
<P>Acro&s;s the park runs an avenue a mile long, of ancient elms. The bi&s;hop could not per|&s;uade him&s;elf to remove this monument of an|tiquity; and I think with great judgment hath left it in its old form; for though an avenue is neither a plea&s;ing nor a picture&s;que arrange|ment of trees, yet the grandeur of this gives it con&s;equence; and its connection with the an|tiquity of the ca&s;tle gives it harmony. Here the poet, after mourning the lo&s;s of other ave|nues, may exult:
<Q><L>Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn</L>
<L>Your fate unmerited: once more rejoice</L>
<L>That yet a remnant of your race &s;urvives.</L></Q></P>
<P>About a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e ari&s;es in the park an eminence, on which &s;tands a keeper's lodge. The &s;ituation is con&s;picuous, but the object unplea&s;ing. A few acres, there|fore, around it are inclo&s;ed, a green-hou&s;e is built to &s;kreen the lodge, and walks are cut, and adorned with different kinds of curious &s;hrubs in high perfection.</P>
<P>From this eminence are &s;everal openings into the country, particularly one towards
<PB N="41" REF="56">
Moor-park, where that enlightened genius, Sir William Temple, (retiring in di&s;gu&s;t from &s;tate affairs, when Charles II.'s politics received a tincture from France,) cultivated every part of literature with an elegance of ta&s;te uncommon at that day. His heart lies buried, according to his will, in a &s;ilver urn, under a dial in his garden. A &s;ingularity of this kind, in prefer|ring a garden to a church-yard, rather favours the opinion which Bi&s;hop Burnet gives us, of Temple's religious &s;entiments.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the views from the park at Farn|ham-ca&s;tle, Crook&s;bury-hill is a di&s;tingui&s;hed feature; which, tradition &s;ays, Sir William Temple always con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t ornaments of his place. This &s;hews his love for nature; though in laying out his grounds, the awkward idea of the times mi&s;led both his theory and practice.</P>
<P>From the terrace before the ca&s;tle, the view is &s;ingular. We overlooked the town of Farnham, and a tract of country, which may properly be called the <HI>vale of hops:</HI> for we &s;aw nothing but ranges of that plant, which was now in full leaf, and made a curious, though very unplea&s;ing, appearance. The hop and the vine, in a <HI>natural</HI> &s;tate, are among the
<PB N="42" REF="57">
mo&s;t picture&s;que plants. Their &s;hoots, their tendrils, their leaves, their fruit, are all beauti|ful: but in their cultured &s;tate they are perfect &s;amples of regularity, &s;tiffne&s;s, and uniformity; which are, of all ideas, the mo&s;t alien to every thing we wi&s;h in land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hews &s;o much the prejudice of names, as the value fixed on Farnham hops. Tho&s;e produced in this pari&s;h &s;ell at Weyhill, and all the great fairs, at a con&s;iderably greater price than tho&s;e which grow even in the next pari&s;h, though divided only by a hedge. To keep up this idea of excellence, the Farnham farmers agree every year on a &s;ecret mark, which they affix to all their own bags. The value of the hops, &s;pread under our eye from the terrace on which we &s;tood, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<P>FROM Farnham to Alton, the road pa&s;&s;es through plea&s;ant lanes. Holt Fore&s;t occu|pying the left, forms an agreeable woody ho|rizon. Sometimes it breaks the line, and ad|vances a little nearer the eye; but it generally keeps the &s;ame di&s;tance, and runs along the higher grounds, through the &s;pace of &s;everal miles. But though it is higher than the neigh|bouring country, it is it&s;elf a tract of level land. We rode through it, and were much plea&s;ed with its woods and lawns.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of it &s;tands a hou&s;e which formerly belonged to Mr. Bil&s;on Legge. A very exten&s;ive lawn is cleared before it, inter|&s;per&s;ed with combinations of trees; and though it is a perfect flat, yet the line of its woody boundary being varied, and removed to differ|ent di&s;tances by retiring woods, the whole has a good effect; which is not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome hand&s;ome trees on the foreground.&mdash;A flat, if it be <HI>very exten&s;ive,</HI> may convey a <HI>grand</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="59">
idea; but when we have a <HI>&s;mall piece</HI> of <HI>flat</HI> ground to improve, all we can do, unle&s;s we vary its &s;urface, is to adorn it with wood. Surrounded with artful &s;cenery, as it is here, it may form a land&s;cape in which the eye may find great entertainment. The water which adorns this lodge, we thought but indifferently managed; though we were told it was con|trived by the late Lord Chatham.</P>
<P>From Alton to Alresford, and from thence to Winche&s;ter, we find little that excites atten|tion. The road is in general clo&s;e, till within a few miles of Winche&s;ter, where the downs begin to open. They are heavy unintere&s;ting &s;wells of ground: but as we proceeded farther, we admired &s;ome of the inter&s;ections of their va&s;t heaving forms, and had at lea&s;t the plea|&s;ure of &s;urveying a large tract of country in its original &s;tate; on which neither Romans, Sax|ons, Danes, nor Britons &s;eem to have made any impre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More impre&s;&s;ion has been made on the&s;e downs within the&s;e la&s;t half dozen years, than had been made before in as many centuries. Large portions of them are now inclo&s;ed, and thrown into tillage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="60">In a valley among the&s;e downs, watered by a con&s;iderable &s;tream, lies Winche&s;ter. As we de&s;cend into it, the great church, and the <HI>King's Hou&s;e,</HI> as it is called, are capital features, and give it an air of grandeur.</P>
<P>The &s;outh &s;ide of the great church is a piece of heavy unadorned Gothic. But this was owing to accident. Formerly the buildings of a mona&s;tery covered this &s;ide of it, and the ar|chitect, William of Wickham, who could not fore&s;ee the di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries, thought it of no con&s;equence to adorn a part of his church, which could never be &s;een.

<P>The in&s;ide, however, of this cathedral is very grand, except about the tran&s;ept, where there &s;eems to have been &s;ome awkward con|trivance. The nave, which is three hundred
<PB N="46" REF="61">
feet in length, is perhaps the mo&s;t magnificent in England. But it is injured by &s;ome monuments, particularly that of the founder, which tre&s;pa&s;s upon it: they are placed between the pillars, and bulge out into the middle ai&s;le of the nave. Indeed I know not whether monu|ments at all in &s;uch churches as pride them|&s;elves on their architecture, can in any &s;hape be con&s;idered as ornamental: the nave of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, for in&s;tance, is injured, <HI>as a piece of architecture,</HI> by the &s;everal monu|ments introduced into it, which, like &s;pots of light in a picture, injure the <HI>whole;</HI> they break in upon its &s;implicity and grandeur. Thus too I doubt whether the introduction of monu|ments will be any advantage to St. Paul's. I &s;hould fear they might injure the grandeur of the dome, which the judicious architect had already adorned, as much as he thought con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ublimity of his idea. In all cathedrals there are cloi&s;ters and other rece&s;&s;es, which are the proper &s;ituations for monuments: and even here every thing &s;hould not be ad|mitted that comes under the name of a monu|ment, and pays the fee. Plain tablets may be allowed; but when figures and ornaments are introduced, they &s;hould be &s;uch as neither di&s;|grace
<PB N="47" REF="62">
the &s;culptor, nor the per&s;on whom he meant to honour. It would be of great advan|tage al&s;o to cla&s;s monuments, as we hang pic|tures in a room, with &s;ome view to &s;ymmetry and order; and, if different profe&s;&s;ions were ranged by them&s;elves, it would &s;till make it more agreeable to examine them.</P>
<P>The choir of Winche&s;ter cathedral is greatly adorned, but without any ta&s;te. The <HI>love of or|nament</HI> is one of the greate&s;t &s;ources of deform|ity; and it is the more to be lamented, as it is very <HI>expen&s;ive,</HI> and very <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> It prevails from the churchwarden, who paints the pillars of his pari&s;h-church blue, and the capitals yel|low; to the arti&s;t, who gilds and carves the choir of a cathedral. A ta&s;te of this kind pre|vails here.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the &s;ituation of the organ &s;eems injudicious. A view along the whole range of the church, no doubt, is grand; but not, I think, of con&s;equence to remove the organ into the awkward &s;ituation in which it now &s;tands, in the middle of one of the &s;ides, where it has no corre&s;pondent part: be&s;ides, an organ, if judiciou&s;ly adorned, is a proper fini&s;hing to one end of the choir, as the com|munion-table
<PB N="48" REF="63">
and its appendages, are to the other.</P>
<P>The wood-work in the choir is elegant Go|thic; but it is greatly injured by a blue band, &s;pangled with golden &s;tars, with which the ground behind it is adorned. What the mean|ing of this &s;trange conceit is, I could not con|jecture.</P>
<P>But the decoration of the altar-piece is the mo&s;t offen&s;ive. The choir is &s;eparated from the chapels beyond it, by a lofty &s;creen. The tabernacle work of this &s;creen &s;till remaining, &s;hews it to have been of the pure&s;t Gothic. It is divided into twelve compartments, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have held &s;tatues of the twelve apo&s;tles. But the&s;e having been de&s;troyed in the time of the civil wars, each Gothic niche is injudiciou&s;ly filled with a Roman urn.</P>
<P>But the projection over the communion-table is &s;till more offen&s;ive. It is a &s;ort of pent|hou&s;e hanging over the table, and adorned with fe&s;toons of flowers. They are &s;aid to have been carved by Gibbons, and probably were; but all the elegant touches of his chi&s;el are de&s;troyed. At Hampton Court, at Chat&s;|worth, and wherever we have the works of this
<PB N="49" REF="64">
ma&s;ter, great care has been taken to pre&s;erve them in their original purity. I believe not even a varni&s;h has been &s;uffered. But here they are daubed all over with brown paint, to|tally at variance with every thing around them; and as if that were not enough, they are al&s;o adorned with profu&s;e gilding.</P>
<P>In&s;hrined amid&s;t all this ab&s;urdity, hangs We&s;t's picture of the Re&s;urrection of Lazarus, which is by no means, in my opinion, among the be&s;t works of this ma&s;ter. The <HI>compo|&s;ition</HI> did not plea&s;e me. The whole is divided formally into three parts, with too little con|nection among them. Je&s;us and his di&s;ciples &s;tand on one &s;ide, the &s;pectators on the other; Lazarus and his &s;i&s;ters occupy the middle. Neither is the <HI>effect of light</HI> nor the <HI>harmony of the colouring</HI> more plea&s;ing. The colouring particularly, which both the &s;tory and the &s;itu|ation of the picture required to be peculiarly mode&s;t, is inharmoniou&s;ly glaring. The <HI>parts</HI> did not appear to more advantage than the <HI>whole.</HI> There is but little of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and varied expre&s;&s;ion, which the &s;tory is meant to excite. In <HI>drawing,</HI> Mr. We&s;t is acknow|ledged to be a perfect ma&s;ter. But there is one thing in the picture which is particularly
<PB N="50" REF="65">
di&s;plea&s;ing. Every painter &s;hould &s;o far pro|vide for the <HI>di&s;tant effect</HI> of his picture, that no improper or di&s;agreeable idea may be excited in the <HI>general view</HI> of it. As you approach this picture, without knowing what the &s;ubject is, a figure at the foot of Lazarus gives the whole too much the appearance of <HI>une femme accouch&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;kreen which &s;eparates the choir from the nave and the ai&s;les, is beautiful <HI>in it&s;elf;</HI> but we are a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch an arti&s;t as Inigo Jones &s;hould not &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of adorning a Gothic church with a Grecian &s;kreen. The &s;tatues of James I. and Charles I. however they come there, would have been in them&s;elves more plea&s;ing, if their uncla&s;&s;ical in&s;ignia of crowns and &s;ceptres had been re|moved.</P>
<P>The <HI>King's Hou&s;e</HI> was built by Sir Chri&s;to|pher Wren for Charles II. It &s;tands on the &s;ite of the old ca&s;tle of Winche&s;ter, loftily overlooking the city, and is, I think, a beautiful piece of architecture. Magnificent it certainly is, extending in front above three hundred feet; and if it had been completed in the grand &s;tyle in which it was conceived, with its lofty cupola, and other appendages; its gar|dens
<PB N="51" REF="66">
and parks laid out in ample &s;pace behind; a noble bridge in front over the ditch; and the &s;treet opened, as was intended, to the we&s;t end of the cathedral, with which its front is parallel; it would have been perhaps one of the grande&s;t palaces in Europe. The death of Charles put an end to the &s;cheme. It had afterwards another chance of being completed; having been &s;ettled on Prince George of Den|mark, if he had &s;urvived Queen Anne. Its la&s;t tenants were &s;ix thou&s;and French pri&s;oners, from who&s;e dilapidations it will not &s;peedily recover <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has &s;ince been much more re&s;pectably occupied by a body of emigrant French prie&s;ts; but is now, I believe, con|verted into a barrack.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Winche&s;ter was not only a regal &s;eat in Saxon times, but one of the fir&s;t towns in Bri|tain. Its hi&s;tory is full of curio&s;ity; and the antiquities with which it abounds confirm its hi&s;tory: but among its antiquities I recollect no <HI>object of beauty,</HI> except an old cro&s;s in the high &s;treet, which is an exqui&s;ite piece of Go|thic architecture; and &s;hews that the arti&s;ts of tho&s;e days could <HI>adapt their ideas of proportion</HI> as well to works of miniature as of grandeur. This little &s;tructure ri&s;es from a ba&s;ement of
<PB N="52" REF="67">
half a dozen &s;teps, with curious open work, in a pyramidal form. It is ornamented in the riche&s;t manner; but its ornaments are becom|ing, becau&s;e they are introduced with propor|tion, uniformity, and &s;ymmetry. If the edges had been gilt and adorned with Chine&s;e bells, it would have been ornamented in a ta&s;te &s;ome|thing like that employed in the choir of the cathedral.</P>

<P>FROM Winche&s;ter to Sali&s;bury the road &s;till continues along downs, the parts of which often fold beautifully over each other. This &s;ort of country, though in it&s;elf unpic|ture&s;que, affords a good &s;tudy for a land&s;cape-painter. It gives him a few large ma&s;terly &s;trokes, and forms an outline which the ima|gination fills up. About a mile &s;hort of Stock|bridge, we had a good di&s;tance on the left.</P>
<P>As we gain the higher grounds about two or three miles before we reach Sali&s;bury, the lofty &s;pire of the cathedral makes its fir&s;t appearance, and fixes the &s;pot to which the road, though devious, will certainly carry us at la&s;t. It is amu&s;ing to &s;ee a de&s;tined point before us, as we come up to it by degrees. It is amu&s;ing al&s;o to transfer our own motion to that of the object we approach. It &s;eems, as the road winds, to play with us, &s;hewing it&s;elf here and there, &s;ometimes totally di&s;appearing, and then ri&s;ing where we did not expect to find it. But the mo&s;t plea&s;ing circum&s;tance in approaching
<PB N="54" REF="69">
a grand object, con&s;i&s;ts in its depo&s;iting by de|grees its various tints of ob&s;curity. Tinged at fir&s;t with the hazy hue of di&s;tance, the &s;pire before us was but little di&s;tingui&s;hed from the objects of the vale. But as it was much nearer than tho&s;e objects, it &s;oon began to a&s;|&s;ume a deeper tint, to break away from them, and leave them behind. As we get &s;till nearer, e&s;pecially if a ray of &s;un&s;hine happen to gild it, the &s;harp touches on the pinnacles &s;hew the richne&s;s of its workman&s;hip, and it begins gradually to a&s;&s;ume its real form.</P>
<P>Sali&s;bury is a plea&s;ant town, with the &s;weet accommodation of a &s;tream of limpid water running through every &s;treet. But the only thing in it worth the attention of a picture&s;que eye, is the great church and its appendages.</P>
<P>Sali&s;bury cathedral is e&s;teemed the only pure &s;pecimen we have of the early &s;tyle of Gothic architecture. It marks the period when Saxon heavine&s;s began fir&s;t to give way. It wants tho&s;e light and airy members which we find in the cathedrals of York, Canterbury, Lincoln, and others of a later period: but it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one beauty which few of them po&s;&s;e&s;s, that of &s;ymmetry in all its parts. The &s;pire is e&s;teemed the loftie&s;t &s;tructure of the kind in
<PB N="55" REF="70">
England. It is very light: yet its great height, e&s;pecially when &s;een either from the ea&s;t or we&s;t, appears rather di&s;proportioned; and in|deed, on the whole, I think, no &s;pire can be &s;o plea&s;ing an object as an elegant Gothic tower. The tower is capable of receiving all the beau|ties of Gothic ornament. Tho&s;e of many of our cathedrals, indeed of many of our pari&s;h churches, as of Derby for in&s;tance, are adorned with great elegance; but the &s;pire, tapering to a point, does not pre&s;ent a &s;ufficient &s;urface for ornament. The bands round that of Sali&s;bury are rather a deformity: nor do I &s;ee what Gothic ornaments &s;o tapering a &s;urface is capable of receiving; for which rea&s;on, though a plain well-proportioned &s;pire may happily adorn a neat pari&s;h church, and make a pic|ture&s;que object ri&s;ing among woods, or in the horizon, I think it is not &s;o well adapted to the rich &s;tyle of a Gothic cathedral: and in|deed &s;ucceeding architects, as the Gothic ta&s;te advanced in purity, laid a&s;ide the &s;pire, and in general adopted the tower. Pinnacles, which are purely Gothic, are very beautiful: and for this rea&s;on the tower part, or foundation of the &s;pire at Sali&s;bury, which is adorned with them, is the only part of it that is intere&s;ting.
<PB N="56" REF="71">
If in&s;tead of the &s;pire, &s;omething of a Gothic dome, or rich open work, had been carried up a moderate height, I think it would have been more beautiful. As it is, the chief idea &s;eems to have been to carry &s;tones higher into the air, than they were ever carried before.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of Sali&s;bury cathedral is more beautiful than the out&s;ide. The a&s;&s;emblage of its various parts, &s;o harmonious among them|&s;elves, and its &s;imple ornaments, though of the rude&s;t Gothic, are very plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>There is one beautiful circum&s;tance in it which I remember not to have &s;een, with &s;o good an effect&punc; in any other cathedral, except that of Wells. To the ea&s;t end of the choir St. Mary's chapel is attached; and appears &s;e|parated from it only by three large pointed open arches behind the communion-table. The internal part of the chapel, with its ea&s;t window and pillars, &s;een through the&s;e arches, gives the conjunct idea of &s;pace and per&s;pec|tive, which is very plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>But this cathedral al&s;o, though in it&s;elf a noble piece of architecture, has been much in|jured by what is called <HI>beautifying.</HI> The nave of the church and &s;ide ai&s;les were painted, as if they had been arched with brick. Nothing
<PB N="57" REF="72">
could be more ab&s;urd or di&s;gu&s;ting. The choir al&s;o was coloured with three tints; which had a bad effect. If the whole had been wa&s;hed with one uniform &s;tone-colour, the natural lights and &s;hades would have been &s;een to more advantage. The prebendal &s;talls al&s;o, and the organ, were all decorated in the &s;ame awkward manner. The ceiling too was patched over with circles containing ugly figures of le|gendary &s;aints: and indeed the whole was a profu&s;ion of bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>To remove all this deformity, and beautify the cathedral, Mr. Wyatt was engaged by the Bi&s;hop and Chapter, and fully an&s;wered the expectation that was rai&s;ed. The figures on the roof are obliterated. The whole is wa&s;hed over with one uniform &s;tone-colour; and the ornaments of the Bi&s;hop's &s;eat and the preben|dal &s;talls are beautiful; though rather perhaps in a &s;tyle of later Gothic than the re&s;t of the church.</P>
<P>Acro&s;s the middle of the choir, from wall to wall, ju&s;t under the roof, ran a ma&s;&s;y beam eighty feet long, and four feet &s;quare. It was a very di&s;gu&s;ting incumbrance; but as it had re&s;ted there beyond the memory of man, and was thought to bind the two walls together, to
<PB N="58" REF="73">
prevent their &s;preading, it had never been touched. Mr. Wyatt, however, examined it, and being per&s;uaded it had no connection with the walls, ventured to remove it; and has done it without any bad con&s;equence. It was &s;up|ported in two or three places by &s;caffolding; and the middle part being &s;awn and taken away, the ends were ea&s;ily removed.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion was, what &s;hould be done with the three large arches which open the view into St. Mary's chapel? Should they be filled with tracery-work, like the ea&s;t win|dows of &s;ome cathedrals? Or, &s;hould they be left open, as they had always been? The latter mode, which was certainly the better, was adopted. Tracery-work would have been out of place in this cathedral; which was built be|fore that mode of ornament was introduced. Be&s;ides, a great beauty would have been lo&s;t, which ari&s;es from a per&s;pective view into the chapel.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion being &s;ettled, another aro&s;e. A very beautiful altar-&s;kreen was con&s;tructed out of the ornaments of a little chapel, which had formerly been attached to the church, and which Mr. Wyatt found it nece&s;&s;ary to re|move. The que&s;tion was, where &s;hould this
<PB N="59" REF="74">
&s;kreen be placed? Some thought it might be placed be&s;t at the end of St. Mary's chapel, &s;o that it might be &s;een to advantage through the arches, which were to be left open entirely to the bottom. In this ca&s;e the communion-table was to be moveable; and to be brought for|ward into the choir only when it was wanted. Others were of opinion, that the communion-table &s;hould &s;tand fixed where it had ever &s;tood; and the &s;kreen, which was a very low one, &s;hould be placed ju&s;t behind it, &s;o as merely to hide the <HI>ba&s;es</HI> of the pillars, and the pavement of St. Mary's chapel; permitting at the &s;ame time a per&s;pective view into it above the &s;kreen. The former of the&s;e opinions pre|vailed, though &s;ome thought it might have been more <HI>proper,</HI> and more in <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> to have taken the latter. It might have been more <HI>proper,</HI> becau&s;e it would have made a &s;eparation be|tween the church and the chapel, which is as de&s;irable at one end, as the &s;eparation made by the &s;kreen and the organ, between the choir and nave, is at the other. Be&s;ides, the com|munion-table is a natural adjunct to the choir, and could not be removed, without making an <HI>improper</HI> break. It might al&s;o be thought in|decent by many people, and give offence. This
<PB N="60" REF="75">
&s;eparation might likewi&s;e have been more in <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> becau&s;e the eye, not having &s;o good a cri|terion of di&s;tance as would be afforded by &s;ee|ing the <HI>ba&s;es</HI> of the pillars, and <HI>pavement</HI> of the chapel, would have conceived the di&s;tance to the ea&s;t-window of the chapel greater than it really is: &s;o that the idea being thus in part curtailed, would in fact have been enlarged. It is an undoubted rule in painting, that an <HI>exact delineation</HI> of a grand object injures its &s;ublimity. Whatever is di&s;cretely left to the imagination is always improved. The&s;e re|marks, however, are founded only in theory; and it is po&s;&s;ible the &s;kreen may have a better effect where it &s;tands at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t window of St. Mary's chapel is adorned with a picture of the Re&s;urrection, in painted gla&s;s. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds gave the de&s;ign; in which, though he had repre&s;ented our Saviour ri&s;ing, he had left the tomb &s;till clo&s;ed and &s;ealed. The Bi&s;hop remon&s;trated, that he had given the fact contrary to the truth of Scripture; where, it is &s;aid, the &s;eal was broken, and the &s;tone removed. Sir Jo&s;hua, however, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted; contending, that by not breaking the &s;eal, he had made the miracle &s;o much the greater; and it was not without
<PB N="61" REF="76">
&s;ome difficulty that the Bi&s;hop got him per|&s;uaded to correct his de&s;ign. The truth, I &s;uppo&s;e, was, Sir Jo&s;hua had not fully, at fir&s;t, attended to the circum&s;tances of the &s;tory; and did not care to be at the trouble of altering his picture. How far this window, in the hands of &s;o eminent a ma&s;ter, may be beautiful, I know not. It was not fini&s;hed when I was la&s;t at Sali&s;bury. But if it be not better than the other ea&s;t-window, given by Lord Radnor, (which is e&s;teemed good in its kind,) it will in my judgment be a di&s;agreeable ornament. In|deed, if colours cannot be better blended on gla&s;s, and harmonized, than I ever &s;aw them, I own I &s;hould never wi&s;h to &s;ee an hi&s;torical &s;ubject painted in this way. The gloom of a painted window in an old cathedral is plea&s;|ing: but I &s;hould de&s;ire only ornamental &s;crawls. The be&s;t painted windows I remem|ber to have &s;een, were (I believe, in the cha|pel) at Magdalen College in Oxford. They are &s;ingle figures, and only in clair ob&s;cure. They are the be&s;t, becau&s;e they are the lea&s;t glaring.</P>
<P>The choir of Sali&s;bury cathedral, thus im|proved under the able hands of Mr. Wyatt, is now one of the mo&s;t beautiful pieces of Gothic
<PB N="62" REF="77">
architecture in England. The deformities of the nave and grand ai&s;les, I fear, will not &s;oon be removed; as there is a deficiency in the fund; but they greatly call for improvement.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the church is a &s;quare cloi&s;ter opening into a chapter-hou&s;e. In abbies, we &s;uppo&s;e, the cloi&s;ter was a place for the monks to enjoy exerci&s;e under cover. But, from the connection of this cloi&s;ter with the chapter-hou&s;e, we are led to imagine it was intended al&s;o as a place for tenants and &s;uitors to wait under &s;helter, till each was called into the chap|ter-hou&s;e to &s;ettle his re&s;pective bu&s;ine&s;s. The chapter-hou&s;e and cloi&s;ters are in the &s;ame way connected at Glouce&s;ter; and may probably be &s;o in other cathedrals.</P>
<P>The cloi&s;ter and the chapter-hou&s;e at Sali&s;|bury belong to an age of much better ta&s;te in architecture than that of the cathedral it&s;elf. They are both of very pure and elegant Go|thic. The former is a light airy &s;quare of about forty feet on each &s;ide. The latter is an octagon of fifty feet in diameter, with a pointed roof, &s;upported by a light column (rather per|haps too light) in the centre. Nothing in ar|chitecture, I think, can be more plea&s;ing than the&s;e buildings; nor does any thing militate
<PB N="63" REF="78">
&s;o much again&s;t a &s;ervile attachment to the five orders. The Greek and Roman architecture, no doubt, po&s;&s;e&s;s great beauty: but why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e them to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>all</HI> beauty? If men were left to their own genius and invention, (as the founders of the Gothic probably were,) we might, it is true, have many ab&s;urd com|po&s;itions, which we have even <HI>now;</HI> but we &s;hould certainly have greater <HI>variety;</HI> and amid&s;t that variety, no doubt, &s;everal new and elegant models. But the five orders have drawn the art &s;o much to them&s;elves, that it would be here&s;y in architecture to oppo&s;e their canons.</P>
<P>Rules, we allow, mu&s;t confine <HI>every art;</HI> but what rules are nece&s;&s;ary to confine <HI>archi|tecture,</HI> except tho&s;e of <HI>utility, &s;ymmetry, pro|portion,</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity? Utility</HI> re&s;pects the pur|po&s;es for which an edifice is rai&s;ed; <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> the general purity and &s;amene&s;s of the &s;tyle; <HI>proportion</HI> the relation of parts; <HI>&s;implicity</HI> the mode&s;ty and propriety of ornaments. I know not in which of the&s;e requi&s;ites the Gothic does not equal the Roman. If in any it may be thought to fail, it is in the ornamental part.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79">In what ta&s;te the private buildings of tho&s;e times were con&s;tructed, when Gothic architec|ture was in its &s;plendor, we know not. It is probable they were not de&s;igned by the emi|nent profe&s;&s;ors of the art, but by low mecha|nics, according to every man's humour, with|out rule or knowledge. Many of them, no doubt, were inconvenient enough, as well as wretchedly adorned. But in the <HI>public</HI> buildings of tho&s;e times, there is generally &s;uch propriety of ornament; that is, each ornamental member <HI>ari&s;es &s;o naturally from the building it&s;elf,</HI> and is &s;o much of a <HI>piece with it,</HI> (which &s;eems to be all we wi&s;h in ornament,) that in the be&s;t &s;pe|cimens of Gothic architecture, the eye is no where offended, or called a&s;ide by the conten|tion of parts; but examines all, <HI>whole</HI> and <HI>parts</HI> together, in one <HI>general view.</HI> In the <HI>interior,</HI> perhaps, the Gothic architect is com|monly more cha&s;te than in the <HI>exterior,</HI> in which he allows him&s;elf more to wanton; and indeed &s;eems to have had a wor&s;e choice of proper ornaments. But in our be&s;t compo|&s;itions, the out&s;ide as well as the in&s;ide is highly beautiful. For my&s;elf, I freely own, I am as much &s;truck with the cathedral of York,
<PB N="65" REF="80">
or with this cloi&s;ter and chapter-hou&s;e, covered as they are with ornaments, as with the noble &s;implicity of the cathedral of St. Paul's. Each &s;tyle is beautiful.</P>
<P>But in comparing the Gothic and Grecian ornaments in architecture, the compari&s;on holds merely with regard to &s;uch ornaments as are <HI>fanciful and ideal.</HI> In portraying or combin|ing &s;uch ornaments as have <HI>nature for their ori|ginal,</HI> either in human or in animal life, the Gothic &s;culptor is in general mi&s;erably de|ficient. He had little knowledge of Nature in <HI>forming,</HI> and le&s;s of Art in <HI>combining:</HI> and yet he is often offending with &s;ome gro&s;s repre|&s;entation of this kind.</P>
<P>In the chapter-hou&s;e at Sali&s;bury, for in|&s;tance, which gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e remarks, amid&s;t all that beautiful profu&s;ion of <HI>fancied ornaments,</HI> &s;o elegant in them&s;elves, and &s;o well adapted to the building to which they are ap|plied, there is likewi&s;e a great profu&s;ion of hi&s;torical &s;culpture. The &s;everal &s;ides of the room are divided into &s;talls for the members of the church. I believe there are not fewer than fifty; and the little angular divi&s;ions between the &s;talls are adorned with bas-relief. As Go|thic workman&s;hip, it is not bad; though it is
<PB N="66" REF="81">
very inferior to Roman or modern &s;culpture. There is no idea either of grace or ta&s;te, or even of proportion in the figures them&s;elves; nor in the mode of combining them. They all repre&s;ent &s;cripture &s;tories; &s;ome of which are very ill-managed. In the &s;tory of Noah, two bea&s;ts are looking out of a window in the ark, &s;ufficient to load it; and Noah him&s;elf praying at the poop is &s;ufficient to &s;ink it. After the civil wars, the parliament commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;at in this chapter-hou&s;e; and have left behind them marks of their rough ideas of re|ligion. At this &s;culpture they &s;eem to have taken particular offence, and have hacked it mi&s;erably. They began as they entered, on the left; and for a while era&s;ed every thing before them: but they &s;eem to have grown tired as they proceeded in their work: the middle part, therefore, is but little injured, and the figures on the right are perfect. If, however, the in|&s;ide of this elegant building were wa&s;hed over with one uniform &s;tone-colour, the &s;culpture obtrudes it&s;elf &s;o little on the eye, that bad as it is, it might ea&s;ily pa&s;s unob&s;erved. Both the cloi&s;ter and chapter-hou&s;e are in &s;o decaying a &s;tate, that it would require a great &s;um to re|&s;tore them; though there is now in the library
<PB N="67" REF="82">
an e&s;timate given in about an hundred years ago, from which it appears that the whole might then have been completely repaired for 150 l. It appears al&s;o from another paper in the library, of ancient date, that the cathedral co&s;t 42,000 marks in building, about twenty eight thou&s;and pounds; which is a much larger &s;um than we &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it could have co&s;t at that early day.</P>
<P>Near the cathedral &s;tands the bi&s;hop's pa|lace, which till very lately was one of the mo&s;t gloomy man&s;ions that can well be imagined. It was a large incumbered hou&s;e, with about a dozen acres of flat ground, by way of garden, lying behind it. This garden was bi&s;ected with a broad canal, and confined within an embattled wall. Such an a&s;&s;emblage of awk|ward circum&s;tances are not often united.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Barrington.</NOTE> has, at great expence, entirely new-modelled this gloomy palace. He has altered the rooms, enlarged the windows, made a new entrance, and given a new appearance to the whole place. One great and very expen&s;ive improve|ment was, to arch over a wide drain, which
<PB N="68" REF="83">
was carried along the whole back-front of the palace. It was pa&s;&s;ed, at different places, by two or three bridges; and was &s;uch a nui&s;ance, that we are &s;urpri&s;ed it had been &s;uffered &s;o long.</P>
<P>As to the flat grounds which were bi&s;ected with the canal, laid out in vi&s;tas, and circum|&s;cribed by an embattled wall, it was impo&s;&s;ible to do more, than to remove a few of the for|malities of the place, and carry a neat gravel walk round it, which near the hou&s;e plays among a few irregular plantations.</P>
<P>But one improvement he has introduced, which adds a grandeur to the garden, beyond what any epi&s;copal &s;eat in England can boa&s;t. He has brought the cathedral into it, in one of its mo&s;t plea&s;ing points of per&s;pective. Be|tween the palace and the cathedral ran for|merly a wall, which included a piece of ground belonging to the bi&s;hops of Sali&s;bury, and u&s;ed as a kitchen-garden.</P>
<P>This wall, and the kitchen-garden, Bi&s;hop Barrington has removed; and has not only obtained a <HI>noble object,</HI> but he has exchanged the di&s;agreeable appearance of a long &s;traight wall, for a very grand boundary to his garden. The cloi&s;ter and chapter-hou&s;e are the parts
<PB N="69" REF="84">
immediately introduced, who&s;e &s;everal abut|ments and projections are plea&s;ing circum|&s;tances. From the&s;e ri&s;es the body of the cathedral; and the &s;pire having here a larger ba&s;e, appears more in proportion.</P>
<P>About a mile from Sali&s;bury Old Sarum for|merly &s;tood. Its &s;ituation and e&s;tabli&s;hment were both very &s;ingular.</P>
<P>Imagine the <HI>ridge</HI> of a hill falling into a <HI>plain;</HI> from the end of which a part having been artificially &s;eparated, forms a round knoll of about two thou&s;and feet in diameter. Cooped within this narrow compa&s;s, &s;tood on a &s;till higher knoll in the centre a formidable ca&s;tle; and ju&s;t below it a cathedral. Here al&s;o &s;tood the bi&s;hop's palace, together with the hou&s;es of his chapter; and the whole was &s;urrounded with immen&s;e ditches and ram|parts, which &s;trike us with a&s;toni&s;hment even at this day.&mdash;So clo&s;e a union between a ca&s;tle and a cathedral, in&s;ulated as they were, and &s;eated &s;o loftily, mu&s;t have made a very &s;ingular appearance, though probably they never had much picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="85">Many retainers no doubt there were on &s;o large a foundation; but it does not appear that any hou&s;es, except tho&s;e of the chapter, were admitted within the precincts of the fortre&s;s. Other appendages &s;eem to have been placed as a &s;uburb under its walls.</P>
<P>Here the bi&s;hops of Sali&s;bury lived like temporal princes; till king Stephen, &s;u&s;pecting the bi&s;hop of that day was attached to the empre&s;s Maud, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him of his ca&s;tle of Sarum, together with two other ca&s;tles which he held; one at Sherborn, from whence the &s;ee had been removed by William I. and the other at the Devizes.&mdash;The ca&s;tle of Sarum was given to a Norman earl, who held a garri&s;on in it for the king.</P>
<P>This became matter of continual conte&s;t. The clergy and the garri&s;on were at con&s;tant variance. Once the bi&s;hop and his clergy returning from a proce&s;&s;ion, found the gates &s;hut again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Wearied at length by repeated in&s;ults they complained to the pope, and at length got a di&s;pen&s;ation to remove the &s;ee of Sali&s;bury to its pre&s;ent &s;ituation. This was &s;oon found to be &s;o very convenient in compari&s;on of the old one, that it drew the inhabitants of
<PB N="71" REF="86">
Old Sarum by degrees after it. The ca&s;tle was left by it&s;elf; and in a few years it al&s;o was de&s;erted, and Old Sarum became only a heap of ruins. But the&s;e ruins, de&s;erted as they are, pre&s;erve a &s;ub&s;tantial proof of their antient dignity in being repre&s;ented by two members in parliament.</P>

<P>FROM Sali&s;bury our fir&s;t excur&s;ion was to Longford Ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of the earl of Radnor. It was built about the time of James the Fir&s;t on a Dani&s;h model; probably by &s;ome architect who came into England with the queen. Its form is triangular, with a round tower at each corner; which gives it a &s;ingu|lar appearance. It &s;tands in a vale, which approaches nearly to a flat; as the Avon, which pa&s;&s;es through the garden, does to &s;tag|nation. Longford Ca&s;tle therefore borrows little from its &s;ituation. All its beauty is the re&s;ult of art, which cannot ri&s;e beyond what may be called <HI>plea&s;ing.</HI> But the principal objects here are the pictures. The whole collection is good. The following we thought &s;ome of the be&s;t.</P>
<P>A Return from the Chace, by Teniers. The compo&s;ition of this ma&s;ter is rarely &s;o good as it is here. His colouring is always plea&s;|ing.</P>
<P>A boy, by Rubens.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="88">Peter de Jode's family, by Vandyck. The heads in this picture are perfect copies from Nature.</P>
<P>A view of Tivoli.</P>
<P>A land&s;cape by Hobima. The compo&s;ition, the light, and the execution in this picture are all good.</P>
<P>Tobias, by Spagniolet.</P>
<P>Two pictures by Pou&s;&s;in. In the&s;e, as in many of this ma&s;ter's works, there is a great deficiency in point of general effect; but the cla&s;&s;ical &s;pirit in which they are painted, with the pure ta&s;te of de&s;ign and correctne&s;s in the parts, will always give value to the works of Pou&s;&s;in. The&s;e I think are executed with a firmer pencil and more &s;pirited touch than mo&s;t of his works.</P>
<P>A land&s;cape by Ruy&s;daal.</P>
<P>Two &s;mall paintings by Callot. It is &s;ur|pri&s;ing with what &s;mart touches this ma&s;ter enlivens his figures. His pictures have all the &s;pirit and preci&s;ion of his etchings.</P>
<P>But the two mo&s;t admired pictures in this collection, are two land&s;capes by Claude, which exhibit the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>decline</HI> of the Ro|man empire in a plea&s;ing allegory. The for|mer
<PB N="74" REF="89">
is repre&s;ented by a &s;un-ri&s;e, and the land|ing of Eneas in Italy: the latter by a &s;un-&s;et, and &s;everal Roman buildings in ruin. No|thing can exceed the colouring of both the&s;e pictures. The hazy light of a ri&s;ing &s;un, and the glowing radiance of a &s;etting one, are exactly copied from nature; and therefore <HI>nicely di&s;tingui&s;hed.</HI> An eye accurate in the effects of nature, will ea&s;ily di&s;cern with which &s;pecies of light the &s;ummit of the wave, or the edge of the battlement is tipped. And yet Claude has in none of his pictures that I have &s;een, di&s;criminated the <HI>&s;hadows</HI> of the morn|ing, which are certainly much darker than tho&s;e of the evening. He does not indeed appear to have marked the difference between them. Nor do we ob&s;erve that painters in general are more accurate. Now and then, with Nature before him, Claude po&s;&s;ibly may give a morning-&s;hadow its character; but when an effect is very rare, it appears to be the re&s;ult of <HI>imitation,</HI> rather than of <HI>prin|ciple.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to <HI>a&euml;rial land&s;cape,</HI> Claude excelled all ma&s;ters. We are at a lo&s;s, whe|ther to admire more the <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> or the <HI>ef|fect</HI> of his di&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="90">But when we have be&s;towed this commend|ation on him, we have &s;ummed up his merit. It all lay in colouring. We rarely find an in&s;tance of good compo&s;ition in any of his pictures, and &s;till more rarely an exhibition of any grand &s;cene or appearance of Nature. As he lived in Italy, he had frequent oppor|tunities of &s;eeing much &s;ublime &s;cenery: but as it &s;eldom &s;truck him, we cannot help in|ferring that his genius was not &s;ublime. If a Dutch ma&s;ter who has &s;een nothing but a flat country, introduces neither rocks, nor ca&s;|cades, nor the &s;loping &s;ides of hills, into his pictures, it is no wonder; but if a painter who has &s;tudied among the Alps and Appen|nines rejects them, it is evident that he has no ta&s;te for this &s;pecies of &s;cenery. Claude and Salvator received, or might have received, their ideas from the &s;ame archetypes: they were both Italian painters: but Claude &s;tudied in the Campagna of Rome; Salvator among the mountains of Calabria. While the one therefore admired the tamer beauties of Na|ture, the other caught fire and ro&s;e to the &s;ublime. I do not mean to in&s;inuate that Claude painted like a Dutchman: but only that his genius was le&s;s &s;ublime than Salva|tor's.
<PB N="76" REF="91">
It is true, the objects he painted are of the <HI>grand &s;pecies:</HI> he &s;aw no other. But as he &s;eldom made the be&s;t u&s;e of them by bring|ing them forward, and producing <HI>grand effects;</HI> it is plain he &s;aw them with indifference; and we conclude it was much the &s;ame to him, whether he painted by the &s;ide of a &s;tagnant canal at Harlem, or under the fall of a ca&s;cade at Tivoli. In &s;hort, he &s;eems to have had a knack of colouring certain objects, &s;kies, and di&s;tances in particular; and this is accounted for by his re&s;iding chiefly in the Campagna. &mdash;As to his figures and foregrounds, if they do not di&s;gu&s;t the eye, it is all we expect. His buildings too are often unplea&s;ing and in|cumbered; and &s;eem calculated rather to &s;hew his &s;kill in architecture than in the production of picture&s;que beauty.&mdash;It is &s;aying how|ever much in favour of Claude, that he had been bred a pa&s;try-cook; and that if he did not do all that might have been done, he did much more than could have been expected.</P>

<P>OUR next expedition from Sali&s;bury was to Stonehenge and Wilton.</P>
<P>Stonehenge, at a di&s;tance, appeared only a diminutive object. Standing on &s;o va&s;t an area as Sali&s;bury Plain, it was lo&s;t in the im|men&s;ity around it. As we approached, it gained more re&s;pect: and we could now trace a large ditch round the whole, confined within a gentle mound. But when we arrived on the &s;pot, it appeared a&s;toni&s;hing beyond con|ception. A train of wondering ideas imme|diately crowded into the mind. Who brought the&s;e huge ma&s;&s;es of rock together? Whence were they brought? For what purpo&s;e? By what machines were they drawn? Or by what mechanic powers erected?</P>
<P>Many have attempted to &s;olve &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e, but none have gone farther than con|jecture. Even the very purpo&s;e for which the&s;e &s;tones were brought together, is not &s;uf|ficiently a&s;certained. Mr. Walpole remarks, that whoever has examined this monument,
<PB N="78" REF="93">
has a&s;cribed it to that cla&s;s of antiquity of which he him&s;elf was mo&s;t fond. This was at lea&s;t the ca&s;e of the celebrated Inigo Jones. On his return from Italy, having nothing but Italian architecture in his head, he found out that Stonehenge was a Roman ruin.</P>
<P>Many idle things, no doubt, have been writ|ten on this &s;ubject. It is a happy field for conjecture. On the whole, perhaps, the la|borious inquiries of Dr. Stukeley have been at|tended with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; for though nei|ther he nor any man could an&s;wer all the in|quiries which curio&s;ity is apt to make on this &s;ubject; yet he &s;eems to have contributed more towards a ju&s;t idea of this wonderful monu|ment, than any other antiquarian. He has gone upon principle. He has traced it by its <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> and other data, into Druid times; and (as far as appears) conviction follows his re&s;earches. In his long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he may, in &s;ome parts, be whim&s;ical; and in many cer|tainly tedious: but allowances &s;hould be made for a man full of his &s;ubject, who, of cour&s;e, will &s;ee many things which he &s;uppo&s;es to be of con&s;equence, and which he cannot, in few words, make apparent to others.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="94">Of the&s;e &s;tones there are an hundred and forty: and by calculation it appears, that each of the large&s;t of them would require the &s;trength of an hundred and fifty oxen to move it.</P>
<P>The outer circle has been formed by a com|bination of two uprights and an impo&s;t; yet each combination of the&s;e three &s;tones is de|tached, and without any connection with the re&s;t, except that of coinciding in the form of a circle. Many of the&s;e uprights &s;till remain; but only five with the impo&s;ts annexed.</P>
<P>The inner circle never had any impo&s;ts, but con&s;i&s;ted only of upright &s;tones. Ten of the&s;e are &s;till &s;tanding out of forty, of which the ori|ginal number is &s;uppo&s;ed to have con&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e circles, there are &s;ome internal parts formed of &s;tones, placed eliptically; &s;ome of which al&s;o have had impo&s;ts. The&s;e Dr. Stukeley conceives to have been the rece&s;&s;es of the prie&s;ts. In this part of the circle al&s;o is placed a &s;tone, which he &s;uppo&s;es to have been an altar.</P>
<P>Rough as all this work appears now to be, after having been expo&s;ed to the &s;torms of two thou&s;and winters, it has been originally con|&s;tructed wlth wonderful art. All the &s;tones
<PB N="80" REF="95">
&s;eem to have been chi&s;eled, on the in&s;ide e&s;pe|cially, with great care; and the impo&s;ts have all been let into the uprights by mortices, and tenons very curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>But it is not the <HI>elegance of the work,</HI> but the <HI>grandeur of the idea,</HI> that &s;trikes us. The walk between the two circles, which is a cir|cumference of three hundred feet, is awfully magnificent: at lea&s;t it would have been &s;o, if the monument had been entire. To be im|mured, as it were, by &s;uch hideous walls of rock; and to &s;ee the land&s;cape and the &s;ky through &s;uch &s;trange apertures mu&s;t have thrown the imagination into a wonderful fer|ment. The Druid, though &s;avage in his na|ture, had the &s;ublime&s;t ideas of the object of his wor&s;hip, whatever it was. He always wor|&s;hipped under the canopy of the &s;ky, and could not bear the idea of a roof between him and heaven. I have known the idea &s;ometimes taken up by pious chri&s;tians, who have con|fe&s;&s;ed they found their minds mo&s;t expanded, when they wor&s;hipped in the open air.</P>
<P>Stonehenge is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the grande&s;t &s;tructure of the kind that exi&s;ts. We meet with many other Druidical remains of this form, though of inferior &s;ize. But I have
<PB N="81" REF="96">
&s;omewhere heard of one in France, inferior indeed to Stonehenge in magnificence, but &s;u|perior to it in elegant con&s;truction. The im|po&s;ts <HI>uniting with each other,</HI> form one conti|nued circle of &s;tone on the top of the uprights; which makes a more plea&s;ing appearance than Stonehenge, where each impo&s;t, re&s;ting on two uprights, &s;tands detached from its neighbour.</P>
<P>Wonderful, however, as Stonehenge is, and plainly di&s;covering that the mind, which con|ceived it, was familiar with great ideas, it is to|tally void, though in a ruinous &s;tate, of every idea of picture&s;que beauty; and I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e was &s;till more &s;o in its perfect one. We walked round it, examined it on every &s;ide, and endeavoured to take a per&s;pective view of it, but in vain; the &s;tones are &s;o uncouthly placed, that we found it was impo&s;&s;ible to form them, from any &s;tand, into a plea&s;ing &s;hape.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;tones, there are others of im|men&s;e &s;ize in different parts of the i&s;land; though none, I believe, &s;o large. Near Bo|rough-bridge two or three of the large&s;t are found, which are known by the name of the <HI>Devil's Arrows.</HI></P>
<P>Volney, in his Travels through Syria, men|tions three &s;tones of white granite, among the
<PB N="82" REF="97">
ruins of Balbeck, each of which was twelve feet thick; and which together extended above fifty-eight yards. And in an adjacent quarry, he found a &s;tone lying, half chi&s;eled, which was &s;ixty-nine feet long, and in breadth and thickne&s;s about thirteen. It was probably too large to be carried from the &s;pot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 241.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About two miles from Dol in Bretagne, in the middle of an orchard, Mr. Wraxall tells us, there is a &s;ingle &s;tone fixed in the earth, of a conic form, which is about forty-five feet high, and nearly as many broad. It had long puz|zled the antiquarians of the country, and gave ri&s;e to various conjectures. Some of them however endeavoured to get at its found|ation. There they found it was really a na|tural production, being fixed to a &s;tratum of &s;olid rock &s;everal feet below the &s;urface <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tour through France, p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plain, on which Stonehenge &s;tands, is in the &s;ame &s;tyle of greatne&s;s as the temple that adorns it. It extends many miles in all direc|tions, in &s;ome not le&s;s than fifty. An eye un|ver&s;ed in the&s;e objects is filled with a&s;toni&s;h|ment
<PB N="83" REF="98">
in viewing wa&s;te after wa&s;te ri&s;ing out of each new horizon.
<Q><L>&mdash; Such appears the &s;pacious plain</L>
<L>Of Sarum, &s;pread like Ocean's boundle&s;s round,</L>
<L>Where &s;olitary Stonehenge, grey with mo&s;s,</L>
<L>Ruin of ages, nods.&mdash;</L></Q>
The ground is &s;pread, indeed, as the poet ob|&s;erves, <HI>like the ocean;</HI> but it is like the ocean after a &s;torm, it is continually heaving in large &s;wells. Through all this va&s;t di&s;trict, &s;carce a cottage or even a bu&s;h appears. If you ap|proach within two or three miles of the edge of the plain, you &s;ee, like the mariner within &s;oundings, land at a di&s;tance, hou&s;es, trees, and villages; but all around is wa&s;te.</P>
<P>Regions, like this, which have come down to us rude and untouched, from the beginning of time, fill the mind with grand conceptions, far beyond the efforts of art and cultivation. Impre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch views of nature, our ance&s;|tors wor&s;hiped the God of nature in the&s;e boundle&s;s &s;cenes, which gave them the highe&s;t conceptions of eternity. Such were the grand ideas of the patriarch, as he ranged the wide regions of the ea&s;t, and &s;et up his monumental pile, not adorned with va&s;es or &s;tatues, but a mound of earth, a rude pillar, which he called
<PB N="84" REF="99">
<HI>God's Hou&s;e,</HI> or &s;ome va&s;t heap of &s;tones, of a fabric, firm as the ground on which it &s;tood, like this before us, which has &s;een in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the ruins of innumerable works of art, and will probably remain undimini&s;hed till the end of time.</P>
<P>All the plain, at lea&s;t that part of it near Stonehenge, is one va&s;t cemetary. Every where, as we pa&s;&s;ed, we &s;aw tumuli or <HI>barrows,</HI> as they are called, ri&s;ing on each hand. The&s;e little mounds of earth are more curiou&s;ly and elegantly &s;haped than any of the kind I re|member el&s;ewhere to have &s;een. They com|monly ri&s;e in the form of bells, and each of them hath a neat trench fa&s;hioned round its ba&s;e; though in their forms, and in the orna|mental circles at their ba&s;es, &s;ome appear to be of more di&s;tingui&s;hed workman&s;hip. They are of various &s;izes, &s;ometimes of thirty, &s;ome|times of forty or fifty yards in diameter. From many places we counted above an hundred of them at once; &s;ometimes as if huddled toge|ther without any de&s;ign; in other places ri&s;ing in a kind of order. By the rays of a &s;etting &s;un the di&s;tant barrows are mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;een. Every little &s;ummit being tipped with a &s;plendid light, while the plain is in &s;hadow,
<PB N="85" REF="100">
is at that time ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. Mo&s;t of them are placed on the more elevated parts of the plain; and generally in &s;ight of the great temple. That they are man&s;ions of the dead is undoubted; many of them having been opened, and found to cover the bones both of men and bea&s;ts; the latter of which were pro|bably &s;acrificed at the funeral. We &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that &s;ome of them contained the promi&s;|cuous a&s;hes of a multitude, as Virgil de&s;cribes them.</P>

<P>Indeed this mode of burial, as the mo&s;t ho|nourable, &s;eems to have been dictated by the voice of nature. We meet with it in Homer; we meet with it in Herodotus. The ve&s;tiges of it are found on the va&s;t plains of Tartary; and even among the &s;avages of Guinea.</P>
<P>That we do not a&s;cribe more antiquity to the&s;e temples and cemetaries, than rightly be|longs to them, the antiquarian hath &s;hewn by many learned arguments. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin an|other

of cla&s;&s;ic origin; from which it will ap|pear probable, that the furniture of the&s;e va&s;t plains was exactly the &s;ame in Cae&s;ar's days, as it is now.</P>
<P>That chief, in the fir&s;t book of his Com|mentaries, de&s;cribing the place, which was agreed on to be the &s;cene of conference be|tween him and Ariovi&s;tus, tells us, it was an exten&s;ive plain, in which was a large artificial mount. <HI>Planities erat magna, et in ea tumulus terreus &s;atis grandis.</HI> I tran&s;late <HI>terreus</HI> by the word <HI>artificial,</HI> becau&s;e it certainly implies &s;ome|thing factitious. No correct writer, &s;peaking of a <HI>natural hill,</HI> would u&s;e &s;uch an epithet. It would be a mere redundancy; and ju&s;t as im|proper as if he had &s;aid, <HI>Planities erat magna terrea.</HI> But in de&s;cribing an <HI>artificial mount,</HI> it is certainly proper; becau&s;e &s;uch a mount might have been con&s;tructed of other materials be&s;ides <HI>earth.</HI></P>
<P>That Cae&s;ar's <HI>tumulus</HI> was intended al&s;o as a memorial for the dead, is probable from the common u&s;e of the word <HI>tumulus;</HI> e&s;pecially when accompanied with the epithet <HI>terreus;</HI> for we know no other u&s;e for which the&s;e <HI>tumuli terrei,</HI> or <HI>artificial mounts,</HI> were con|&s;tructed, but that of being memorials of the
<PB N="87" REF="102">
dead; and for this u&s;e we know they cer|tainly were con&s;tructed. We find Aeneas like|wi&s;e haranguing his troops from a tomb of this kind:
<Q>&mdash; Socios in caetum littore ab omni Advocat Aeneas, tumulique ex aggere fatur.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled Cae&s;ar's <HI>tumulus terreus</HI> to have been a <HI>barrow;</HI> and knowing al&s;o from him, that the Druids frequented Gaul, we are led to believe, that his <HI>planities magna,</HI> and <HI>Sa|li&s;bury Plain,</HI> were places of the &s;ame kind; both of them mo&s;t probably Druid &s;cenes. Cae&s;ar indeed mentions but one tumulus on his plain: but as he was de&s;cribing only a parti|cular &s;pot, not the general &s;cene, we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e there might be many other barrows, and perhaps a Stonehenge al&s;o in the neigh|bourhood of it.</P>
<P>It is probable al&s;o, (as Cae&s;ar tells us the Druid di&s;cipline was carried originally into Gaul, from Britain, which was the great &s;ource of Druid-learning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Di&s;ciplina haec in Britannia reperta; atque inde in Galliam tran&s;lata e&s;&s;e, exi&s;timatur: et nunc, qui diligentius eam rem cog|no&s;cere volunt, plerumque ill&ograve;, di&s;cendi cau&s;&acirc;, profici&s;cuntur. <BIBL>Lib. iv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>,) that Sali&s;bury Plain might
<PB N="88" REF="103">
have been a &s;cene of great antiquity many years before the time of Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Though Sali&s;bury Plain in Druid times was probably a very bu&s;y &s;cene, we now find it wholly uninhabited. Here and there we meet a flock of &s;heep, &s;cattered over the &s;ide of &s;ome ri&s;ing ground; and a &s;hepherd with his dog, attending them; or perhaps we may de|&s;cry &s;ome &s;olitary waggon winding round a di&s;tant hill. But the only re&s;ident inhabitant of this va&s;t wa&s;te is the bu&s;tard. This bird, which is the large&s;t fowl we have in England, is fond of all exten&s;ive plains, and is found on &s;everal; but the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to be his principal haunt. Here he breeds, and here he &s;pends his &s;ummer-day, feeding with his mate on juicy berries, and the large dew-worms of the heath. As winter approaches, he forms into &s;ociety. Fifty or &s;ixty have been &s;ome|times &s;een together.</P>
<P>As the bu&s;tard leads his life in the&s;e unfre|quented wilds, and &s;tudiou&s;ly avoids the haunts of men, the appearance of any thing in mo|tion, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, alarms him. I know not that he is protected, like the partridge and phea&s;ant, by any law; but his own vigilance is a better &s;ecurity to him than
<PB N="89" REF="104">
an act of parliament. As he is &s;o noble a prize, his fle&s;h &s;o delicate, and the quantity of it &s;o large, he is of cour&s;e frequently the ob|ject of the fowler's &s;tratagems. But his cau|tion is generally a protection again&s;t them all. The &s;cene he frequents, affords neither tree to &s;helter, nor hedge to &s;kreen, an enemy; and he is &s;o tall, that when he rai&s;es his neck to take a per&s;pective view, his eye circum&s;cribes a very wide horizon. All open attempts therefore again&s;t him are fruitle&s;s. The fowl|er's mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;tratagem is to conceal him&s;elf in a waggon. The we&s;t country wag|gons, periodically travelling the&s;e regions, are objects to which the bu&s;tard is mo&s;t accu&s;|tomed; and though he retires at their ap|proach, he retires with le&s;s evident &s;igns of alarm, than from any thing el&s;e. It is po&s;&s;ible therefore, if the fowler lie clo&s;e in &s;uch a con|cealment, and with a long barrelled gun can direct a good aim, he may make a lucky &s;hot. Sometimes al&s;o he &s;lips from the tail of a wag|gon a couple of &s;wift greyhounds. They &s;oon come up with the bu&s;tard, though he runs well; and if they can contrive to reach him, ju&s;t as he is on the point of taking wing, (an operation which he performs with le&s;s expe|dition
<PB N="90" REF="105">
than is requi&s;ite in &s;uch critical circum|&s;tances,) they may perhaps &s;eize him.</P>
<P>Some encroachments have been made by the plough, within the&s;e few years, upon Sali&s;bury Plain. But the&s;e inroads, though con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, bear little proportion to the va&s;t|ne&s;s of the&s;e downy grounds. The plough is a heavy invader; and its per&s;everance only can produce a vi&s;ible effect in &s;o va&s;t a &s;cene.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on al&s;o may operate powerfully in pre&s;erving the&s;e wide domains in a &s;tate of nature. The &s;oil is, in mo&s;t places, very &s;hal|low, not above five or &s;ix inches above a rock of chalk; and as the tillage of two or three years exhau&s;ts it, without more expence than the land will an&s;wer, it hath been thought but ill hu&s;bandry to de&s;troy a good &s;heep-walk, for a bad piece of arable land.</P>
<P>But though Sali&s;bury Plain is a remarkable &s;cene in England, it is nothing in compari&s;on of many &s;cenes of this kind on the face of the globe, in which the eye is carried, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, <HI>out of &s;ight;</HI> where an extent of land, flat, like the ocean, melts gradually into the horizon. Such are many parts of Poland and Tartary. The plains of Yede&s;an, on the bor|ders of Be&s;&s;arabia, are among the mo&s;t extra|ordinary.
<PB N="91" REF="106">
Baron de Tott de&s;cribes them on his journey to the Cham of Tartary, as &s;o im|men&s;e, that he tells us, (&s;omewhat I think hy|perbolically,) the piercing eyes of the Tartars, who rode before him, could di&s;tingui&s;h the heads of the hor&s;emen in the horizon, when the <HI>convexity of the earth hid the re&s;t of their bodies.</HI> His de&s;cription is more natural after|wards, when he &s;ays, he &s;aw the &s;un ri&s;e and &s;et on the&s;e plains, as navigators do at &s;ea. Their &s;ingularity con&s;i&s;ts both in their va&s;tne&s;s and in certain regular vallies which bi&s;ect them. The&s;e vallies are di&s;tant from each other about ten or twelve leagues, and run in parallel lines acro&s;s the plain. They are totally void of the u&s;ual ornaments of our vallies, va|riety of ground, a foaming rivulet, and woody banks: they are mere trenches, cut out by Nature, about twenty yards deep, and &s;ome|times a quarter of a mile broad; &s;o that as you traver&s;e the plain, the eye pa&s;&s;es over them like &s;unk fences, and all appears one boundle&s;s wa&s;te. Through the middle of each of the&s;e vallies is a muddy rivulet, and as there is no elevation of ground, it is almo&s;t &s;tagnant. The cour&s;e of the&s;e rivulets, &s;uch as it is, leads from north to &s;outh; and at the end of the plain they form
<PB N="92" REF="107">
&s;mall lakes, which communicate with the Black Sea. In the&s;e vallies the Tartars of Yede&s;an fix their tents, while their numerous herds of hor&s;es, oxen, dromedaries, and &s;heep graze the plains. The&s;e herds are continually wander|ing from home in &s;ummer, e&s;pecially the larger kinds; and the chief employment of the Tar|tar is, to gallop about in que&s;t of them. He takes a quantity of roa&s;ted millet in a bag, mounts his hor&s;e, and rides till &s;un-&s;et. Then if he find not what he &s;ought, he clogs his hor&s;e, and leaves it to graze; and as he is al|ways at home, he &s;ups, wraps him&s;elf in his cloak, and &s;leeps till morning, when he begins his &s;earch again. Having given this general account of the plains of Yede&s;an, Baron Tott &s;peaks of his fir&s;t day's journey over them. The conclu&s;ion of it was the neare&s;t valley, at about ten leagues di&s;tance. The &s;un was now &s;etting; and after a long journey, <Q>I &s;till &s;aw nothing before me,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>but a va&s;t melancholy plain, when I &s;uddenly felt my carriage de&s;cend, and looking out, I &s;aw a range of tents, extending to the right and left. We cro&s;&s;ed a rivulet over a bad bridge, and found three tents on the other &s;ide out of the line, one of which was intended for me.

<P>But of all the plains of which we meet with any account, tho&s;e of the de&s;erts of Arabia are the mo&s;t forbidding. Perhaps no part of the globe, of equal circumference, is &s;o totally de&s;|titute of Nature's bounty, and of every kind of vegetable furniture:

The Tartarean plains, ju&s;t de&s;cribed, are bi|&s;ected with &s;treams and vallies, &s;uch as they are, covered with herbage. But the barren|ne&s;s of the Arabian plain in no part inter|mits. The tents, hor&s;es, and camels of the caravan, to which the traveller is attached, are the only objects he &s;ees. If he &s;hould fix one end of an immen&s;e cord at the&s;e tents, the other might be carried round, along the rim of a boundle&s;s horizon, without &s;weeping over any inequality. All this va&s;t circle is covered
<PB N="94" REF="109">
with grey &s;and, like the a&s;hes of a furnace. Over all hangs the canopy of heaven undiver|&s;ified by a &s;ingle cloud to break the rays of a &s;corching &s;un; while a breeze, if it can be called &s;uch, glowing with heat, often fills the air with clouds of overwhelming du&s;t; or to|tally de&s;troys its vital &s;pring.

<P>HAVING &s;atisfied our curio&s;ity on Sali&s;|bury Plain, and performed the due rites at Stonehenge by pacing its dimen&s;ions, and counting the &s;tones, we proceeded to Wilton. The point of Sali&s;bury &s;pire, ju&s;t emerging from the horizon, guided us acro&s;s the open country; and as we got into the more cul|tivated part, we turned out of the Sali&s;bury road, and fell down into Wilton, which lies in a vale on the edge of the plain. We can|not expect a very beautiful &s;cene in the neigh|bourhood of &s;uch a wa&s;te. Nature's tran|&s;itions are generally gradual. The true pic|ture&s;que vale is rarely found in any country, but a mountainous one. Great plenty of wood and water however give an agreeable air to the vale of Wilton.</P>
<P>Wilton was once the capital of all this country, to which it gave its name. But Sali&s;bury drawing Old Sarum within its vor|tex, drew Wilton al&s;o. At pre&s;ent this vil|lage is chiefly remarkable for the &s;plendid pa|lace of the Earls of Pembroke.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="112">Wilton-hou&s;e was formerly an Abbey; and felt the full weight of the inqui&s;ition &s;et on foot in the reign of Henry the Eighth. The ladies of Wilton-abbey were accu&s;ed of too great an intimacy with the monks of a neigh|bouring hou&s;e. Stories of this kind were li&s;tened to at the time of the di&s;&s;olution with great attention; though often perhaps void of any foundation. Both hou&s;es however fell together; and the deme&s;nes of Wilton were given to the Pembroke family, in who&s;e hands they &s;till continue. The earl of that day began immediately to turn the abbey into a man&s;ion: but the plan was not completed in its pre&s;ent &s;tate till late in the reign of Charles I. The garden-front by Inigo Jones is admired by all judges of architecture. The portico boa&s;ts the hand of Hans Holbein. There are &s;ome things however yet wanting to give the hou&s;e an air of magnificence. The entrance is particularly awkward and incum|bered <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this was written, it has been altered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the morning threatened rain, we thought it better to take a view of the garden, before we entered the hou&s;e: it occupies the centre
<PB N="98" REF="113">
of a wide valley, adorned with a river. This river was fa&s;hioned, by the conductors of ta&s;te in the la&s;t age, into an immen&s;e canal. It is now changed again into an irregular piece of water. But though its banks are decorated with rich garden-&s;cenes, it &s;till retains enough of formality to &s;ugge&s;t the old idea. It forms however the grande&s;t view in the garden. Sali&s;bury church comes in very happily as an object at the bottom of it; and is of &s;ufficient magnitude to &s;hew that it was not con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Garden-&s;cenes are never <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> They want the bold roughne&s;s of nature. A prin|cipal beauty in our <HI>gardens,</HI> as Mr. Walpole ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, is the &s;moothne&s;s of the turf: but in a <HI>picture,</HI> this becomes a dead and uni|form &s;pot; incapable of light and &s;hade, and mu&s;t be broken in&s;ipidly by children, dogs, and other unmeaning figures; &mdash; that is, I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Walpole means, by &s;uch figures as commonly frequent garden-&s;cenes, which are of all others the mo&s;t unpicture&s;que. And yet I have been informed that Mr. B. Wil&s;on made a good land&s;cape even of this &s;cene. He took it, however, from that end which is neare&s;t to Sali&s;bury, where he got <HI>a rougher
<PB N="99" REF="114">
foreground</HI> than he could find in the garden. In a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> he might more ea&s;ily di&s;gui&s;e a <HI>garden-&s;cene.</HI></P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e, the river Willy enters the canal. It is a river only of &s;mall dimen|&s;ions, but over it is thrown a magnificent Pal|ladian bridge.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought the Palladian bridge may be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of bom|ba&s;t in architecture. It is like expre&s;&s;ing a plain <HI>&s;entiment</HI> in a <HI>pompous phra&s;e.</HI> Merely to pa&s;s a trifling &s;tream, a plank with a &s;imple rail is &s;ufficient; and in a <HI>pa&s;toral</HI> &s;cene, it is all you require. In &s;uch a &s;cene as <HI>this,</HI> indeed, a &s;imple plank would be <HI>out of place.</HI> You are compo&s;ing <HI>in heroics.</HI> But a certain &s;pecies of &s;implicity is required even here; and as in all <HI>literary compo&s;itions</HI> turgid expre&s;&s;ions offend, why &s;hould they not offend in <HI>every</HI> mode of compo&s;ition? Here we allow a hand&s;ome bridge is nece&s;&s;ary. But why <HI>more</HI> than a bridge? What have pillars&mdash;walls&mdash;pediments &mdash;and roofs to do with a bridge? A bridge in it&s;elf is one of the mo&s;t beautiful of artificial objects: but dre&s;&s;ed in this bomba&s;t &s;tyle, it offends: it offends at lea&s;t the &s;implicity of a picture&s;que eye. If you want a cool, airy
<PB N="100" REF="115">
building to receive the refre&s;hment of a &s;um|mer breeze, as it pa&s;&s;es over the lake, erect one in &s;ome proper place, and if it be well di&s;|po&s;ed, nobody can take offence. But let it &s;tand for what it is. Do not leave people in doubt whether it is a hou&s;e or a bridge, by <HI>uniting</HI> modes of architecture, which are in them&s;elves <HI>di&s;tinct;</HI> and giving one the orna|ments that belong to another. From the&s;e critici&s;ms we except &s;uch bridges as are &s;itu|ated, like the Rialto at Venice, which, connect|ing the parts of a large city, may be allowed to a&s;&s;ume a corre&s;pondent air of grandeur; and may with propriety even be covered with a roof. But here no &s;uch accommodation is nece&s;&s;ary; and what is unnece&s;&s;ary is always affected.</P>
<P>From the Palladian bridge and banks of the river, the ground ri&s;es beautifully, con&s;i&s;ting of a hanging lawn, encompa&s;&s;ed with wood, which is broken into plea&s;ing parts. But here, though in &s;ight of the Palladian bridge, we have another ornament full as much out of <HI>place</HI> as the other was out of <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;ummit of the hill is erected a tri|umphal arch, with Marcus Aurelius mounted on hor&s;eback on the top of it.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="116">Now if we only recollect the intention of a triumphal arch, we &s;hall &s;ee how grote&s;quely &s;uch a fabric is erected here.</P>
<P>When a Roman general triumphed, it was the cu&s;tom to rai&s;e the&s;e arches, through which the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed to the city; and they were &s;ometimes con&s;tructed and adorned in a very magnificent manner, and left as memo|rials of the great event on which they were at fir&s;t erected. All this was noble, and admir|ably adapted to the intended purpo&s;e. But we have here a triumphal arch &s;et upon the top of a hill, totally unconnected with any thing near it. A triumphal arch would be perhaps too pompous a &s;tructure to form a part of the <HI>approach</HI> to the hou&s;e; yet in that capacity it might have been <HI>&s;uffered;</HI> it might have had &s;ome analogy at lea&s;t to its &s;ituation. But as it now &s;tands, however good it may be in it|&s;elf, it is certainly an ab&s;urd o&s;tentatious orna|ment.</P>
<P>The rain coming on obliged us to leave the re&s;t of the garden un&s;een, and drove us into the hou&s;e. It prevented al&s;o our &s;eeing the &s;tables, which are very grand; and what we &s;till regretted more, a row of cedars of Liba|non, which are e&s;teemed the fine&s;t in England.
<PB N="102" REF="117">
We &s;aw them afterwards from the windows of the hou&s;e, but probably to &s;ome di&s;advantage, as they did not an&s;wer the expectations we had formed of them.</P>
<P>The grand collection of &s;tatues in Wilton-hou&s;e entitle it very de&s;ervedly to the attention of every traveller. When we enter the great hall, we are &s;truck with the profu&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t view of &s;uch a collection, it be|comes matter of wonder how Italy can be &s;o inexhau&s;tible a fund of ancient &s;tatues. Be|&s;ides their peopling all the palaces of that coun|try, there is not a cabinet in Europe which is not more or le&s;s inhabited by them. All come from Italy. Italy has been &s;upplying the cu|rious with antiques for many centuries; and they who have money may buy antiques in Italy &s;till.</P>
<P>The wonder will, in &s;ome degree, &s;ub&s;ide, when we con&s;ider the rage for &s;culpture which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ancient Romans. Statues were the chief ornaments of old Rome, and had for ages been collected there by all ranks of people.</P>
<P>The conque&s;t of Greece brought them fir&s;t into repute. As they became more admired; praetors and procon&s;uls made them every where

Statues, ba&s;s-reliefs, bu&s;ts, pillars, every thing that could be &s;evered from the buildings to which they belonged, were &s;wept away to Rome. Temples, baths, porticoes, and other public places, were fir&s;t adorned. The con|quered provinces could not &s;upply the demand. Arti&s;ts were called from Greece: Parian mar|ble was imported; and &s;tatues were erected to the Gods, and heroes of Rome, as had been erected before to tho&s;e of Greece:

adorned with him&s;elf, his wife, and his family, all &s;culptured to the life in &s;tone. Many of the&s;e ignoble &s;tatues might, in length of time, depo&s;it their plebeian forms, and vi&s;it foreign countries, as Scipios, Cae&s;ars, and Octavias. It is not every connoi&s;&s;eur who can detect them by their garb.</P>
<P>From what has been ob&s;erved, we may ea&s;ily judge what an inexhau&s;tible fund of an|tiques Rome, and its colonies, (for the rage &s;pread over all the neighbouring parts of Italy,) might produce. Quantities, no doubt, of the&s;e works are &s;till laid up in tho&s;e magazines of ruin and rubbi&s;h which Goths and other bar|barous invaders have heaped upon them.</P>
<P>The &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, and ba&s;s-reliefs, which we now &s;urvey, were chiefly collected by the cardinals Mazarin and Richlieu; and the Earl of Arundel, in Charles the Fir&s;t's time. Addi|tions have been made &s;ince. Some, I have been told, were pre&s;ented by one of the Dukes of Tu&s;cany, to whom an Earl of Pembroke had &s;hewn particular civilities, during his &s;tay in England. The collection, no doubt, is very magnificent, (one of the fir&s;t, perhaps, in Eu|rope, if we except royal and cla&s;&s;ic ground,) and many of its contents are excellent pieces of
<PB N="105" REF="120">
art. In general, however, they may be cla&s;&s;ed, as Martial cla&s;&s;es his epigrams, into good, bad, and indifferent. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that in &s;o nu|merous a collection the whole can be valuable. In many of tho&s;e, however, which are indiffer|ent, &s;ome of the parts may be good, and afford u&s;eful &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Among the bu&s;ts which &s;truck us mo&s;t, (on the tran&s;ient view we were able to give them,) were tho&s;e of Miltiades&mdash;Hannibal&mdash;Pindar&mdash; Adrian&mdash;Cleopatra, the &s;i&s;ter of Alexander&mdash; &mdash; Lepidus &mdash; Sophocles &mdash; Pompey &mdash; Nerva&mdash; Labienus Parthicus &mdash; Semiramis &mdash; Marcellus the younger&mdash;Metellus imberbis&mdash;Diana&mdash;Lu|can &mdash;Caracalla&mdash;Alcibiades&mdash;Cecrops&mdash;Vitel|lius &mdash;and Galba. Pyrrhus of Epire is parti|cularly fine. The air of this bu&s;t is very noble; and is impre&s;&s;ed with the whole character of the hero. A collo&s;&s;ean bu&s;t too of Alexander the Great is &s;triking; but the head &s;eems ra|ther too long. Probably it might be covered, though I do not recollect the circum&s;tance, with a Grecian helmet. If &s;o, the head-piece and vi&s;or, connected without a joint, when thrown back, would make the head too long by the addition of the length of the face.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="121">Among the alto-relievos, we admired two Cupids&mdash;Curtius&mdash;Saturn&mdash;&s;ome Boys eating grapes&mdash;Uly&s;&s;es in the cave of Calyp&s;o&mdash;Sa|turn crowning the Arts&mdash;Cupid &s;ucking Venus &mdash;The &s;tory of Claelia&mdash;Silenus on his a&s;s&mdash; &mdash;Galataea&mdash;Cupids and Boys&mdash;A Boy on a &s;ea-hor&s;e.&mdash;A Victory, the compo&s;ition of which is very good&mdash;A Prie&s;te&s;s &s;acrificing, in which the animals are particularly fine&mdash;A Nuptial Va&s;e, both the form and &s;culpture of which are elegant.</P>

The pillar too in the outward court may here be mentioned; the whole of which has an elegant appearance, and the &s;tatue is beautiful.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to avoid remarking that the&s;e antiques might po&s;&s;ibly have been arranged in a more judicious manner. The <HI>apartments</HI> of a noble hou&s;e &s;hould not &s;uffer their <HI>ornaments</HI> to obtrude <HI>foremo&s;t</HI> upon the eye. Each apart|ment &s;hould pre&s;erve its <HI>own dignity;</HI> to which the <HI>ornamental</HI> part &s;hould be <HI>&s;ubordinate.</HI> In every work of art, and indeed of nature al&s;o, it is a breach of the mo&s;t expre&s;s picture&s;que canon, if the <HI>parts</HI> engage the eye more than the <HI>whole.</HI> The hall, therefore, the &s;tairca&s;e, the &s;aloon, and other apartments, might be adorned with a few bu&s;ts and &s;tatues; but to receive the whole collection, perhaps a long gallery &s;hould have been <HI>profe&s;&s;edly</HI> built. In this they might have been arranged in <HI>profu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;tructing &s;uch a gallery, little orna|ment would be required. Here the <HI>&s;tatues</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="123">
would be the objects, not the <HI>room.</HI> To <HI>them</HI> therefore the <HI>whole</HI> &s;hould be &s;ubordinate: they would con&s;titute the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>Two things in &s;uch a gallery &s;hould chiefly be con&s;idered; the colour of the walls, and the di&s;tribution of the light. If the walls were &s;tained with a darki&s;h olive-tint, they would perhaps &s;hew the &s;tatues to the be&s;t advantage; and yet a lighter tinge might probably give them more &s;oftne&s;s. The experiment might ea&s;ily be tried.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>light,</HI> it &s;hould be high, but not vertical. If the antiques were ranged on one &s;ide of the room, the light might be in|troduced from high windows on the other. Such a light would not certainly be the mo&s;t picture&s;que, as each figure, at lea&s;t when &s;tu|died, would require a &s;ide light, appropriated to it&s;elf. But this in a degree might be ob|tained by the means of curtains.</P>
<P>Much of the beauty of &s;uch a room would depend on the mode of arranging the antiques. The ba&s;s-reliefs might be put in plain &s;quare frames, and affixed to the wall; the bu&s;ts might &s;tand on brackets between them, or in rece&s;&s;es; and the &s;tatues might occupy the
<PB N="109" REF="124">
front. Or perhaps, on examining the whole collection together, &s;ome more happy arrange|ment might be formed.</P>
<P>As nobody in England but the Earl of Pem|broke could fit up &s;uch a gallery, it &s;hould not perhaps be made entirely a private concern. It would be generous and noble to lay it open to arti&s;ts, when well recommended; and to let them &s;tudy in it, under proper re&s;trictions. It would bring Italy, as much as could be, into England.</P>
<P>But &s;tatues are not the only furniture at Wilton: it contains many very valuable pic|tures.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e we admired mo&s;t were,</P>
<P>A Cattle-piece, by Ro&s;a of Tivoli. Few ma&s;ters are better acquainted with compo&s;ition, colouring, and the di&s;tribution of light. This picture, though not a capital one, is an in&s;tance of his &s;kill in all the&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P>A whole-length of the fir&s;t Lady of the &s;e|cond Earl Philip, and a half-length of the Counte&s;s of Ca&s;tlehaven: both the&s;e are by Vandyck, and both are excellent.</P>
<P>Mrs. Kelligrew and Mrs. Morton, by Van|dyck: the latter we admired very much.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="125">Mr. James Herbert, by Lely.</P>
<P>A Carpet and Boar's-head, by Malte&s;e. The compo&s;ition is a &s;trange one, but the picture is well painted.</P>
<P>An old Woman with Fi&s;h, by Snyders. The fi&s;h are ma&s;terly, but the compo&s;ition is di&s;|agreeable.</P>
<P>An old Woman reading, by Rembrant.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t taken from the Cro&s;s, by Albert Du|rer. They who admire the works of the old ma&s;ters, will find a very good one here.</P>
<P>A large Fruit-piece, with Figures, by M. An|gelo delle Battaglio. It is a tradition in the family, that M. Angelo kept this picture in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as a favourite piece; and that Sir Robert Gere bought it of his widow for three hundred pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>Democritus, by Spagnolet. The &s;tyle of painting in this picture is admirable; but the character of Democritus is bad.</P>
<P>Four Children, by Rubens. For compo&s;ition and colouring we &s;eldom &s;ee a more plea&s;ing picture, either by this ma&s;ter, or any other.</P>
<P>The Virgin with Chri&s;t, by Cantarini. The manner is indi&s;tinct, but the boy is a beautiful figure.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="126">The divi&s;ion of Chri&s;t's Garments, by Carracci. This picture is well painted, but the light is ill-managed.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s Sophia, habited like a Shep|herde&s;s, by Huntor&s;t.</P>
<P>A good Virgin, by Carlo Dolce.</P>
<P>An admirable portrait of Titian, by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Woman taken in Adultery, by Janeiro. The &s;tory is not well told; but the figures are beautifully grouped.</P>
<P>A good Schalken.</P>
<P>An old Man &s;elling Plumbs to Children, by Francis Hals. This is a happy &s;ubject to &s;hew plea&s;ure and di&s;appointment in young faces; and the painter has been as happy in his expre&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>In one of the rooms I remember meeting with a picture of Pietro Te&s;ta, which is uncom|mon. There is great &s;pirit in it.</P>
<P>But the capital picture at Wilton, is the large family-piece by Vandyck. Of the excellence of this picture we are told many &s;tories; that it is Vandyck's ma&s;ter-piece; that it is celebrated through Europe; and that it might have been covered with gold, as a price to obtain it. This latter is a compliment which I have often heard paid in great hou&s;es to favourite pictures; and
<PB N="112" REF="127">
as the King of France is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the riche&s;t man in Europe, he is generally intro|duced, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, as the bidder. For my&s;elf, I own I am not entirely of the King of France's opinion. I have examined this pic|ture with great attention; and reluctantly own I cannot bring my&s;elf to admire it, either in the <HI>whole,</HI> or in its <HI>parts.</HI> Vandyck's portrait of King Charles I. over a chimney at Hamp|ton Court <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe it is now removed.</NOTE>, which con&s;i&s;ts only of a &s;ingle figure, I freely own I &s;hould prefer to this, though it con&s;i&s;ts of thirteen.</P>
<P>Vandyck &s;eldom appears to advantage when he has <HI>&s;everal figures</HI> to manage. His ma&s;ter Rubens early &s;aw this, and de&s;ired him to re|linqui&s;h hi&s;tory, and apply to portrait. He did; but here he is again engaged in hi&s;tory; that is, he has a number of figures at full length to manage in one large piece, which extends twenty feet by twelve. The compo|&s;ition of &s;uch a work required more &s;kill than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there is no attempt at <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> Some little family-&s;cene &s;hould have been introduced, which might have drawn the figures <HI>into one action.</HI> Thus Titian repre&s;ents
<PB N="113" REF="128">
the Cornaro family joining in an act of devo|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This picture belongs to the Duke of Northumberland.</NOTE>. Without &s;omething of this kind, the figures had better have been painted in <HI>&s;epa|rate pictures.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> too is wanting as well as <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> The figures are ill-grouped, and produce <HI>no whole.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>colouring</HI> too is glaring. Yellow, red, and blue are the &s;ources, when <HI>properly blended,</HI> of every harmonious tint; but here they &s;tare in raw colours. Every gaudy figure &s;tands foremo&s;t to catch the eye; except the princi|pal figures, which are attired in black. The young people are all &s;o richly dre&s;&s;ed, that it &s;eems as if their father and mother had ordered them to put on their be&s;t clothes, and come down to be painted: and that the painter had drawn them &s;o attired, ju&s;t as he &s;aw them, without any di&s;tinction or choice of drapery. To de&s;troy the harmony &s;till more, a large e&s;|cutcheon of the Pembroke arms hangs in one corner of the picture, filled with &s;uch a profu|&s;ion of red and yellow, that it catches the eye at once, and may properly be called one of the principal figures.</P>
<P>If from a <HI>general</HI> view of the picture, we proceed to <HI>particulars,</HI> I fear our critici&s;ms mu&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="129">
be equally &s;evere. Never painter, it mu&s;t be owned, had that happy art which Vandyck po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of turning earths and minerals into fle&s;h and blood. Never painter had that happy art of compo&s;ing a &s;ingle figure with the cha&s;te &s;implicity of nature, and without affectation or artifice of any kind; and &s;ome of the figures in this picture are, no doubt, compo&s;ed in this &s;tyle, particularly the Earls of Pembroke and Carnarvon. But the figures in general, when con&s;idered apart, are far from capital. Some of the attitudes are forced: you look in vain for Vandyck's wonted &s;implicity. But what di&s;gu&s;ts us mo&s;t, is a want of harmony. In all pictures, whether the faces are old or young, the <HI>&s;ame coloured light,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, &s;hould be &s;pread over all,&mdash;the mellow or the blui&s;h tinge, ari&s;ing from the &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere, whatever it is, through which the light is thrown upon them: but here this rule is &s;o far from being ob&s;erved, that even allowing the variation of different complexions, the faces of all, though of one country, belong to different climates. A yellow-faced boy parti|cularly, among the front figures, has a com|plexion, which nothing but a jaundice or an Indian &s;un could have given him. For the
<PB N="115" REF="130">
re&s;t, &s;ome of the carnations are very beautiful; particularly the hands of the Counte&s;s of Pem|broke.</P>
<P>All this cen&s;ure, however, mu&s;t not be laid to the charge of Vandyck. His pencil could never have been guilty of &s;uch violence again&s;t Nature. I have been a&s;&s;ured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the late Lord Orford.</NOTE>, that about a dozen years ago, this picture was retouched by a painter, I think, of the name of Brompton. I &s;aw it before that time, and &s;ome years after; and as far as my memory &s;erves, it was altered much for the wor&s;e. This may account for mo&s;t of the faults that may be found with the <HI>carnations.</HI></P>
<P>It would have been a happy thought to re|pre&s;ent the dead children by little cherubs ho|vering in the air; if the picture had had an <HI>em|blematical</HI> ca&s;t. In <HI>&s;erious portrait,</HI> the thought &s;eems rather out of place.</P>
<P>At Wilton-hou&s;e the accompli&s;hed Sir Phi|lip Sidney (who&s;e beloved &s;i&s;ter was married to the Earl of Pembroke) wrote his Arcadia; a work of &s;uch fancy, that although not accom|modated to the refinement of this age, it was greatly admired in the la&s;t, and went rapidly through eight editions.</P>

<P>FROM Wilton we returned to Sali&s;bury; and from thence proceeded to Fonthill, the &s;eat of Mr. Beckford. The road conveyed us through lanes, along the edge of the plain. About Denton the ground lay beautifully; the hills de&s;cending gently on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>Fonthill is a noble hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a park, which contains great variety of ground. It takes its name from a woody hill and fountain hard by it, from which ri&s;es a &s;tream that a&s;&s;i&s;ts in forming an artificial river, decorated by a very &s;umptuous bridge. If the bridge had been more &s;imple, the &s;cene about it would have been more plea&s;ing. The ground, though <HI>artificially formed, &s;lopes well</HI> to the river on each &s;ide, and beyond the bridge opens into a &s;weet retiring valley.</P>
<P>Mr. Beckford &s;eems al&s;o to have been a&s;&s;i|duous in making a collection of pictures; and in point of numbers, he has &s;ucceeded. A So|crates, by Salvator, is mo&s;t e&s;teemed. But though a capital picture, it &s;eems ill-coloured, being a mere yellowi&s;h clair ob&s;cure; nor has Socrates any character. I mu&s;t add, however,
<PB REF="132">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="117" REF="133">
that I have, oftener than once, judged fal&s;ely on the fir&s;t &s;ight of Salvator's pictures, which have plea&s;ed me more on a &s;econd view. This, however, is certainly a fault. We expect from a good picture, as from a good man, a favour|able impre&s;&s;ion at &s;ight.</P>
<P>But if there be few good pictures at Fonthill, there is abundance of &s;plendor; not without a little da&s;h of vanity and o&s;tentation. What is wanting in ta&s;te, is made up in finery. Never hou&s;e was &s;o bedecked with all the pride of up|hol&s;tery. The very plate-gla&s;s in one room co&s;t fifteen hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this was written, I have been informed that Fonthill hath been much improved; particularly that a cathedral hath been built of the full dimen&s;ions of a genuine one. As Mr. Wyatt was the architect, it mu&s;t be a noble edifice; and if it be properly &s;tationed, it mu&s;t be a grand decoration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Fonthill we proceeded through Hen|don to Stourhead, the &s;eat of Mr. Hoare, along downs overlooking an exten&s;ive di&s;tance on the left. We &s;oon came in &s;ight of the hou&s;e and plantations, adorned with towers &s;tretch|ing in a line along the horizon. The planta|tions, which &s;eemed to &s;tand on a flat, ap|peared, in this di&s;tant view, very regular, and
<PB N="118" REF="134">
gave us but an unfavourable idea of the place. The my&s;tery, however, of this apparently un|plea&s;ing &s;ituation, was unravelled when we came upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Mr. Hoare purcha&s;ed Stourhead about forty years ago, of Lord Stourton, who takes his title from a village of that name in the neigh|bourhood. The improved grounds con&s;i&s;t of three parallel vallies; all of them clo&s;ed at one end by an immen&s;e terrace, running &s;everal miles in length, with little deviation either to the right or left. This was the horizontal &s;tretch of unplea&s;ing ground, which we &s;aw at a di&s;tance. The vallies run from it nearly at right angles; and were entirely &s;kreened from the eye, as we approached.</P>
<P>But though Mr. Hoare has taken all the three vallies, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal miles in cir|cumference, within his improvements, he has <HI>adorned</HI> that only which lies neare&s;t his hou&s;e. The other two are planted and cut into rides; but the wood is yet young.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e is built on an elegant de&s;ign by Colin Campbell, the architect of Wan&s;tead-hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex. It con&s;i&s;ts of a ba&s;ement; one grand floor, and an attic. We enter a hand&s;ome hall, and pa&s;s into the &s;aloon, which
<PB N="119" REF="135">
is a noble room, &s;ixty feet in length. On each &s;ide of the&s;e rooms range the apartments.</P>
<P>Several good pictures adorn them. Tho&s;e we admired mo&s;t, were</P>
<P>Some Market pea&s;ants, by Gain&s;borough. Both the figures and the effect of this picture are plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Conference between Jacob and E&s;au, by Ro&s;a of Tivoli. This is a capital picture, and abounds with amu&s;ement, though it is neither painted in the ma&s;ter's be&s;t manner, nor are the figures well-grouped.</P>
<P>A &s;mall land&s;cape, by Lucatelli.</P>
<P>A Holy Family, by Caracci.</P>
<P>A land&s;cape, by Rembrandt. The back|ground and &s;ky are dark; and the figures &s;it|ting on the fore-ground, and &s;een by fire-light, have a good effect.</P>

<P>From the hou&s;e we went to view the im|provements around it. That valley near which
<PB N="120" REF="136">
the hou&s;e &s;tands, and which I have mentioned as the mo&s;t adorned, contains a very noble &s;cene. It is called the valley of <HI>Six-wells,</HI> from &s;ix heads of the river Stour, which ari&s;e here, and which the Stourton family take for their arms. The produce of the&s;e &s;prings is col|lected into a grand piece of water; in which, and the improvements on its banks, con&s;i&s;t the beauties of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>In the common round, we are carried fir&s;t to the lower parts, along the margin of the lake, which we cro&s;s in a narrow part, by a &s;u|perb wooden bridge, and &s;till continuing along the water, are amu&s;ed with a grotto, which has more propriety in it, than the&s;e places com|monly have. Here ari&s;es one of the heads of the Stour, which a well-cut river God (Deus ip&s;e loci) pours from his urn.</P>
<P>There is another grotto al&s;o near this, in which the &s;prings are collected into a marble bath. It is adorned with the &s;tatue of a &s;leep|ing nymph, under whom you read the&s;e lines: <Q><L>Nymph of the grot, the&s;e &s;acred &s;treams I keep,</L>
<L>And to the murmur of the&s;e waters &s;leep.</L>
<L>Ah! &s;pare my &s;lumbers; gently tread the cave;</L>
<L>And drink in &s;ilence; or in &s;ilence lave.</L></Q></P>

<P><PB N="121" REF="138">Leaving the&s;e grottos, we a&s;cend the higher grounds, and &s;o proceed from one ornamental building to another, every where entertained with different views of the lake, and its banks.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e buildings is very beautiful. It is called the Pantheon, as it is built on &s;ome|thing like the model of the Pantheon at Rome. Though it is only the <HI>ornament of a garden,</HI> it is a <HI>&s;plendid edifice.</HI> The rotunda, which is the grand part of it, is lighted from the top, and is thirty-&s;ix feet in diameter. To this is added a portico, and an apartment on each &s;ide. The in&s;ide of the rotunda is adorned with &s;tatues and bas-relievos; and in the centre &s;tands an excellent Hercules, by Ry&s;brach.</P>
<P>This &s;tatue was the work of emulation. Ry&s;brach had long enjoyed the public favour without a rival. Schemaker fir&s;t aro&s;e as a competitor; and afterwards Rubiliac, both arti&s;ts of great merit; the latter of uncommon abilities. Ry&s;brach, piqued at &s;eeing the ap|plau&s;e of the public divided, executed this &s;ta|tue as a proof of his &s;kill. He compo&s;ed it from the &s;elected limbs of &s;ix or &s;even of the heroes of Broughton's amphitheatre; a &s;cene
<PB N="122" REF="139">
of diver&s;ion, at that time, in high repute. The brawny arms were taken from that chief him|&s;elf; the che&s;t from the <HI>coachman,</HI> a champion well known in his day by that appellation; and the legs from Ellis the painter, who took more delight in Broughton's amphitheatre, than in his own painting-room.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed our circuit round the gar|den, we were on the whole much plea&s;ed. There is a greatne&s;s in the <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> though &s;ome|times a littlene&s;s in the <HI>execution.</HI> The build|ings, in general, are good; but they are too nu|merous and too &s;umptuous. The gilt-cro&s;s is a very di&s;gu&s;ting object. Indeed, &s;implicity is every where too much wanting. Many of the open|ings al&s;o are forced; and the banks of the lake in &s;ome places formal; the paths are mere zig|zags; the going off of the water, and all the ma|nagement about the head of the lake, which is always a bu&s;ine&s;s difficult to manage, is awk|ward and perplexed; and as to the grounds near the hou&s;e, they are &s;till in the old &s;tyle of avenues and vi&s;tas. We &s;aw many things at the &s;ame time which plea&s;ed us, particularly the <HI>line of the lake,</HI> in general, along its &s;hores; the woody &s;kreens that environed it; and the
<PB N="123" REF="140">
effect of &s;ome of the buildings in the land&s;cape, <HI>when &s;een &s;ingle,</HI> e&s;pecially that of the Pan|theon. On the whole, we &s;pent an agreeable &s;ummer evening at Stourhead, and found more amu&s;ement than we generally find in places &s;o highly adorned.</P>
<P>The next morning we vi&s;ited the more di&s;|tant parts of Mr. Hoare's improvements, the other two vallies and the terrace. The vallies will be more beautiful, as the woods improve; at pre&s;ent they are but unfurni&s;hed; and yet in their naked &s;tate we &s;aw more clearly the pecu|liarity of the ground. Three vallies, thus clo&s;ed by an immen&s;e terrace, is a &s;ingular production of nature. Some parts of the terrace command a mo&s;t exten&s;ive di&s;tance. At the point of it, where it falls into the lower ground, a trian|gular tower is erected for the &s;ake of the view. Over the door is the figure of King Alfred, with this in&s;cription:
<Q><PB N="124" REF="141">
<L>In Memory of Alfred the Great,</L>
<L>Who, on this &s;ummit,</L>

<P>From the tower of Alfred, we returned to Stourhead, after a ride of at lea&s;t eight miles through the different parts of Mr. Hoare's plantations.</P>

<P>FROM Stourhead to Froom, we pa&s;&s;ed through an inclo&s;ed country, which is barren of amu&s;ement. On our right, we left Maiden-Bradley, an old hou&s;e belonging to the Duke of Somer&s;et; and went a few miles out of our road to &s;ee Longleat, the man&s;ion of Lord Weymouth.</P>
<P>Longleat is a noble old fabric, the work|man&s;hip of John Padua, about the year 1567. This architect was much e&s;teemed by the Pro|tector Somer&s;et, who&s;e hou&s;e in the Strand he built. Sir John Thyn, who employed him here, was one of the Protector's principal offi|cers. The &s;tyle, however, of Longleat has more a ca&s;t of the Gothic, than that of Somer|&s;et-Hou&s;e, which makes a nearer approach to Grecian architecture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e in the Strand is now pulled down, and an expen&s;ive edifice for various offices erected in its room.</NOTE>. Neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es enough of its re&s;pective &s;tyle, to be beautiful in its kind. The Gothic &s;tyle perhaps at be&s;t is but ill adapted to private buildings. We
<PB N="126" REF="143">
chiefly admire it, when its clu&s;tered pillars adorn the walls of &s;ome cathedral; when its pointed ribs &s;pread along the roof of an ai&s;le; or when the tracery of a window occupies the whole end of a choir. Gothic ornaments in this &s;tyle of magnificence lo&s;e their littlene&s;s. They are not con&s;idered as <HI>parts,</HI> but are lo&s;t in <HI>one va&s;t whole;</HI> and contribute only to im|pre&s;s a <HI>general</HI> idea of richne&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes indeed &s;ee the <HI>&s;maller appen|dages</HI> of cathedrals decorated very beautifully in the Gothic &s;tyle; as the chapter-hou&s;e at Sali&s;bury, and that mo&s;t elegant building at Ely, called the <HI>Pari&s;h-churcb.</HI> But in the&s;e buildings the <HI>proportions</HI> chiefly fill the eye: for which &s;uch ornaments are contrived, as have a good effect. Ornaments of this kind I have never &s;een u&s;ed in any <HI>private hou&s;e</HI> of Gothic con&s;truction. Nor indeed are they proper. As they are only found in &s;acred buildings, it might perhaps have been e&s;teemed a mode of profanene&s;s, to adopt them in pri|vate &s;tructures. This idea, indeed, the Gothic architects them&s;elves &s;eem to have had, by never u&s;ing them but in churches.</P>
<P>On the whole, the Grecian architecture &s;eems much better adapted to a private dwell|ing-hou&s;e,
<PB N="127" REF="144">
than the Gothic. It has a better <HI>a&s;&s;ortment,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, of proper orna|ments, and proportions for all its purpo&s;es. The Gothic ornaments might dre&s;s up a hall or a &s;aloon; but they could do little more: we &s;hould find it difficult to decorate the flat roof of an apartment with them, or a pa&s;&s;age, or a &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor are the <HI>conveniencies,</HI> which the Grecian architecture be&s;tows on <HI>private buildings,</HI> le&s;s con&s;iderable, than the beauty of its <HI>decorations.</HI> The Gothic palace is an <HI>incumbered</HI> pile. We are amu&s;ed with looking into the&s;e man&s;ions of antiquity, as objects of curio&s;ity; but &s;hould never think of comparing them in point of convenience with the great hou&s;es of modern ta&s;te, in which the hall and the &s;aloon fill the eye on our entrance; are noble re&s;ervoirs for air; and grand antichambers to the &s;everal rooms of &s;tate that divide on each hand from them.</P>
<P>Longleat has nothing of the Grecian gran|deur to recommend it. It is a large &s;quare building, with a court in the middle; which is intended to enlighten the inner chambers. The whole is certainly a grand pile; but it has little beauty, and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e le&s;s conve|nience.
<PB N="128" REF="145">
It is at pre&s;ent however exceedingly in di&s;habille, and the furniture &s;eems to be the relics of the la&s;t century. The family of the Thynnes cover the walls in great profu&s;ion. We rarely &s;ee &s;o numerous a collection of por|traits without one that is able to fix the eye.</P>
<P>Be the in&s;ide of the hou&s;e and its contents however what they may, when we view it &s;eated, as it is, in the centre of a noble park, which &s;lopes down to it in all directions, it&s;elf a grand object, evidently the capital of the&s;e wide domains, it has certainly a very princely appearance.</P>
<P>Somewhere among the woods of this man|&s;ion, was fir&s;t naturalized the Weymouth-pine. This &s;pecies of pine is among the mo&s;t formal of its brotherhood; and yet the planter mu&s;t con&s;ider it, in point of variety, as an acqui&s;ition. The patriarch-pine, Mr. Walpole tells us, &s;till exi&s;ts, but we did not &s;ee it.</P>

<P>FROM Longleat we pur&s;ued our road through Froom to Wells. The fir&s;t part of our journey pre&s;ented nothing very inte|re&s;ting. As we approached Mendip-hills, the road divides; one branch leading <HI>over</HI> tho&s;e high grounds, the other <HI>under</HI> them. We cho&s;e the latter, which afforded us, on the right, tho&s;e hills for a back-ground; and on the left, an exten&s;ive di&s;tance, in which Gla&s;tonbury|tor, as it is called, is the mo&s;t con&s;picuous fea|ture.</P>
<P>Our approach to Wells, from the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>incidental</HI> beauties of the &s;cene, was un|commonly picture&s;que. It was a hazy even|ing; and the &s;un, declining low, was hid be|hind a deep purple cloud, which covered half the hemi&s;phere, but did not reach the we&s;tern horizon. Its lower &s;kirts were gilt with daz|zling &s;plendor, which &s;pread downwards, not in diverging rays, but in one uniform ruddy glow; and uniting at the bottom with the
<PB N="130" REF="148">
mi&s;tine&s;s of the air, formed a rich, yet mode&s;t tint, with which Durcote-hill, projecting boldly on the left, the towers of Wells beyond it, and all the objects of the di&s;tance, were tinged; while the foreground, &s;een again&s;t &s;o bright a piece of &s;cenery, was over&s;pread with the darke&s;t &s;hades of evening. The whole toge|ther invited the pencil, without &s;oliciting the imagination. But it was a tran&s;itory &s;cene. As we &s;tood gazing at it, the &s;un &s;unk below the cloud, and being &s;tripped of all its &s;plendor by the hazine&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, fell, like a ball of fire, into the horizon; and the whole radiant vi&s;ion faded away.</P>
<P>Wells is a plea&s;ant town, and agreeably &s;itu|ated. The cathedral is a beautiful pile, not|with&s;tanding it is of Saxon architecture. The front is exceedingly rich, and yet the parts are large. In the towers, the upper &s;tories are plain, and make a good contra&s;t with the rich|ne&s;s of the lower. But this circum&s;tance ap|pears to mo&s;t advantage when the towers are &s;een in profile; in front there is too much or|nament. In the in&s;ide the Saxon heavine&s;s prevails more. The choir-part is in better ta&s;te; and the retiring pillars of the chapel be|yond
<PB N="131" REF="149">
the communion-table, produce an un|u&s;ual and very plea&s;ing effect, like that at Sa|li&s;bury. The chapter-hou&s;e is an elegant octa|gon, &s;upported by a &s;ingle pillar. One of the pari&s;h churches al&s;o at Wells is adorned with a very hand&s;ome Gothic tower, and is it&s;elf a beautiful pile.</P>
<P>Near Wells is a famous cavern, called Okey-hole. It lies under Mendip-hills, which in this place form a beautiful rece&s;s, adorned with rock and wood. A rece&s;s of this kind appears of little value to tho&s;e who are acquainted with mountainous countries; but in the &s;outh of England it is a novel &s;cene. As to the cavern it&s;elf, it runs about three hundred yards under ground, dividing into three large apartments. But no cavern that I know, except that at Ca&s;tleton in Derby&s;hire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of it in Mr. G.'s Northern Tour, vol. ii. p. 210.</NOTE>, is worth vi&s;iting in a picture&s;que light. Caverns, in general, are mere holes, and have no connection with the ground about them. That at Ca&s;tleton has a grand entrance, and the rocky &s;cenery, with which it is hung, forms a mo&s;t magnificent approach. But in the cavern here, there is no
<PB N="132" REF="150">
grandeur of this kind; &s;o that it contributes little to the beauty of the rece&s;s in which it lies.</P>
<P>From Okey-hole we returned to Wells; and from thence proceeded to Gla&s;tonbury; the ruins of which had highly rai&s;ed our expect|ation.</P>

<P>THE ground on which the abbey of Gla&s;|tonbury &s;tands, is higher than the neigh|bouring di&s;trict, which is a perfect flat; in&s;o|much, that tradition &s;ays, it was formerly co|vered with the &s;ea. If that was the ca&s;e, the ground which the abbey occupies, if not an i&s;land, was at lea&s;t a penin&s;ula. To this day it bears the name of <HI>the I&s;le of Avelon;</HI> and the meadows around it &s;eem plainly to have been wa&s;hed and relinqui&s;hed by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The abbey of Gla&s;tonbury, therefore, does not enjoy that choice &s;ituation which the ge|nerality of religious hou&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;s. <HI>Original foundations,</HI> like this, were generally fixed by accidental cau&s;es. An e&s;cape from a &s;hipwreck; a battle; a murder; the &s;cene of &s;ome prince's death; with a variety of other circum&s;tances, have commonly determined their &s;ite; &s;o that if they enjoy a good &s;ituation, it &s;eems to be accidental. Tho&s;e religious hou&s;es who&s;e &s;itu|ation we particularly admire, I &s;hould conjec|ture, have been chiefly colonies, or off-&s;ets
<PB N="134" REF="152">
from the great religious hou&s;es. In <HI>the&s;e</HI> there might be a <HI>choice of &s;ituation.</HI></P>
<P>The event which &s;ettled the &s;ituation of this abbey, is firmly atte&s;ted, on the proof of Romi&s;h legends. When Jo&s;eph of Arema|thea came to preach the Go&s;pel in Britain, as it is a&s;&s;erted he did, he landed on the I&s;le of Avelon; and fixing his &s;taff in the ground, (a dry thorn-&s;aplin, which had been his companion through all the countries he had pa&s;&s;ed,) fell a&s;leep. When he awoke, he found, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, that his &s;taff had taken root, and was covered with white blo&s;&s;oms. From this miracle, however, he drew a very natural conclu&s;ion, that as the u&s;e of his &s;taff was thus taken from him, it was ordained that he &s;hould fix his abode in this place. Here, therefore, he built a chapel, which, by the piety of &s;ucceeding times, increa&s;ed into this magni|ficent foundation.</P>
<P>Of this immen&s;e fabric nothing now remains, but a part of the <HI>great church, St. Jo&s;eph's chapel,</HI> an <HI>old gate-way,</HI> part of the <HI>abbot's lodge,</HI> and the <HI>kitchen.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>great church,</HI> the &s;outh &s;ide is nearly entire; &s;ome part of the ea&s;t end remains; a little of the cro&s;s i&s;le; and a remnant of the tower;

all of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t elegant Gothic. The north &s;ide was lately taken down, and the materials were applied to build a meeting-hou&s;e. From this defalcation, however, the ruin, as a picture&s;que object, &s;eems to have &s;uffered little. In <HI>corre&s;pondent</HI> parts, if one only be taken away, or con&s;iderably fractured, it may po&s;&s;ibly be an advantage. But we greatly regret the lo&s;s of the we&s;t end, which was taken down to build a town-hall. Still more we regret the lo&s;s of the tower; as the eye wants &s;ome elevated part to give an apex to the whole. Be&s;ides, in that part of the tower which remains, there is rather a form|ality. Two &s;imilar points, which have been the &s;houlders of a Gothic arch, ari&s;e in equal dimen&s;ions, and do not ea&s;ily fall into a pic|ture&s;que form.</P>
<P><HI>St. Jo&s;eph's chapel,</HI> which &s;tands near the we&s;t end of the great church, is almo&s;t entire. The roof indeed is gone; but the walls have &s;uffered little dilapidation. This chapel was probably more ancient than the church, as it has evidently a mixture in it of Saxon archi|tecture; but the &s;tyle is very pure in its kind; and the whole is rich and beautiful. It is no little addition to its beauty, that ivy is &s;pread
<PB N="136" REF="156">
about over the walls, in &s;uch ju&s;t proportion, as to adorn without defacing them.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh-we&s;t of St. Jo&s;eph's chapel, &s;tands the <HI>Gate of &s;trangers,</HI> which &s;eems to have been a heavy building, void of elegance and beauty. Not far from the Gate of &s;trangers, and connected with it in de&s;ign, are &s;hewn the foundations of the Lingui&s;t's lodge: but no part of it, unle&s;s it be a po&s;tern, is now left. This was a very nece&s;&s;ary part of an endow|ment, which was vi&s;ited by &s;trangers from all parts of the world.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbot's lodge</HI> has been a large building. It ranges parallel with the &s;outh &s;ide of the church; and was nearly entire within the me|mory of man. It was a &s;uit of &s;even apart|ments on a floor; but very little of it is now left. In the year 1714 it was taken down to an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;e of economy, though it &s;eems never to have been a &s;tructure of any beauty.</P>
<P>Hard by the Abbot's lodge &s;tands the <HI>Kitchen,</HI> which is to this day very entire, and is both a curious remnant of antiquity, and a noble mo|nument of monki&s;h ho&s;pitality. It is a &s;quare building, calculated to la&s;t for ages. Its walls are four feet thick, and yet &s;trengthened with
<PB N="137" REF="157">
ma&s;&s;y buttre&s;&s;es. They have, indeed, an im|men&s;e roof to &s;upport, which is &s;till in excel|lent repair. It is con&s;tructed of &s;tone, and &s;eems to be a work of very curious ma&s;onry, running up in the form of an octagonal pyra|mid, and fini&s;hed at the top in a double cupola. The under part of this cupola received the &s;moke, in channels along the in&s;ide of the roof; and the upper part contained a bell, which fir&s;t called the &s;ociety to dinner, and afterwards the neighbouring poor to alms. The in&s;ide of the Kitchen is an octagon; four chimnies taking off the corners of the &s;quare. It has two doors, and mea&s;ures twenty-two feet from one to the other, and a hundred and &s;eventy from the bottom to the top. In this Kitchen, it is re|corded, that twelve oxen were dre&s;&s;ed gene|rally every week, be&s;ides a proportional quan|tity of other victuals.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the vi&s;ible remains of this great hou&s;e. Foundations are traced far and wide, where, it is conjectured, the cloi&s;ters ran; the monks cells; the &s;chools; the dormitories; halls; and other offices. The whole together has been an amazing combination of various build|ings. It had the appearance indeed of a con&s;ider|able town, containing perhaps the large&s;t &s;o|ciety
<PB N="138" REF="158">
under one government, and the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive foundation that ever appeared in Eng|land in any form. Its fraternity is &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred e&s;tabli&s;hed monks, be&s;ides nearly as many retainers on the abbey. Above four hundred children were not only educated in it, but entirely maintained. Stran|gers from all parts of Europe were liberally re|ceived; cla&s;&s;ed according to their &s;ex and na|tion; and might con&s;ider the ho&s;pitable roof, under which they lodged, as their own. Five hundred travellers, with their hor&s;es, (though they generally, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, travelled on foot,) have been lodged at once within its walls. While the poor from every &s;ide of the country waited the ringing of the alms-bell; when they flocked in crowds, young and old, to the gate of the mona&s;tery, where they received, every morning, a plentiful provi&s;ion for them&s;elves and their families: all this appears great and noble.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when we con&s;ider five hundred per&s;ons, bred up in indolence, and lo&s;t to the commonwealth; when we con&s;ider that the&s;e hou&s;es were the great nur&s;eries of &s;uper&s;tition, bigotry, and ignorance; the &s;tews of &s;loth, &s;tupidity, and perhaps intemperance; when we con&s;ider, that the education received
<PB N="139" REF="159">
in them had not the lea&s;t tincture of u&s;eful learning, good manners, or true religion, but tended rather to vilify and di&s;grace the human mind; when we con&s;ider that the pilgrims and &s;trangers who re&s;orted thither, were idle vaga|bonds, who got nothing abroad that was equi|valent to the occupations they left at home; and when we con&s;ider, la&s;tly, that indi&s;crimi|nate alms-giving is not real charity, but an avocation from labour and indu&s;try, checking every idea of exertion, and filling the mind with abject notions, we are led to acquie&s;ce in the fate of the&s;e great foundations, and view their ruins, not only with a picture&s;que eye, but with moral and religious &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>This great hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ample&s;t reve|nues of any religious hou&s;e in England. Its ancient domains are &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>now</HI> to yield not le&s;s than an annual income of two hundred thou&s;and pounds. I have heard them calcu|lated at much more.</P>
<P>Within a mile of the abbey &s;tands the <HI>Torr,</HI> which is by much the highe&s;t land in the i&s;land of Avelon, and had been our land-mark through an approach of many leagues. The &s;ummit of this hill is decorated with a ruin, which has its effect, though in it&s;elf it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
<PB N="140" REF="160">
no beauty. It is a &s;tructure of ambiguous in|tention. One tradition &s;uppo&s;es it to have been a &s;ea-mark, for which it is well adapted. Another makes it an oratory. To the abbot it certainly belonged.</P>
<P>Here the holy man, when Satan led him a&s;ide, might &s;ometimes a&s;cend, and looking round him, might &s;ee all the country his own; hou&s;es and villages filled with his va&s;&s;als; mea|dows covered with innumerable flocks and herds to &s;upport the &s;trength of his table; rivers and woods abounding with fi&s;h and game to furni&s;h its delicacies; fields waving with corn to fill his granaries and his cellars; and, among other &s;ources of luxury, no fewer than &s;even ample parks, well &s;tocked with ve|ni&s;on. Here was a glorious view indeed! His heart might dilate, as the vi&s;ion expanded: and if he were not well upon his guard, he might ea&s;ily have mi&s;taken an earthly reverie for holy joy and religious gratitude.</P>
<P>Near the bottom of this hill are found great quantities of that &s;pecies of putrefaction which re&s;embles a coiled &s;erpent; or, as it is often called, an <HI>Ammon's horn.</HI></P>
<P>The ruins of Gla&s;tonbury-abbey occupy a piece of ground, about a mile in circumfe|rence,
<PB N="141" REF="161">
which has no peculiar beauty, but might be improved into a very grand &s;cene, if it were judiciou&s;ly planted, and laid out with ju&s;t &s;o much art, as to di&s;cover the ruins to the be&s;t advantage. But &s;uch &s;chemes of improvement are calculated only for po&s;terity. A young plantation would ill accord with &s;uch antique accompaniments. The oak would require at lea&s;t a century's growth, before its mo&s;s-grown limbs could be congenial with the ruins it adorned.</P>
<P>I &s;hould ill de&s;erve the favours I met with from the learned antiquarian, who has the care of the&s;e ruins, though he occupies only the humble craft of a &s;hoemaker, if I did not at|tempt to do &s;ome ju&s;tice to his zeal and piety. No picture&s;que eye could more admire the&s;e venerable remains for their beauty, than he did for their &s;anctity. Every &s;tone was the object of his devotion. But above all the appendages of Gla&s;tonbury, he reverenced mo&s;t the famous thorn which &s;prang from St. Jo&s;eph's &s;taff, and blo&s;&s;oms at Chri&s;tmas. On this occa&s;ion he gave us the following relation.</P>
<P>It was at that time, he &s;aid, when the King re&s;olved to alter the common cour&s;e of the year, that he fir&s;t felt di&s;tre&s;s for the honour of
<PB N="142" REF="162">
the hou&s;e of Gla&s;tonbury. If the time of Chri&s;tmas were changed, who could tell how the credit of this miraculous plant might be af|fected? In &s;hort, with the fortitude of a Jewi&s;h &s;eer, he ventured to expo&s;tulate with the King upon the &s;ubject; and informed his Maje&s;ty, in a letter, of the di&s;grace that might po&s;&s;ibly en&s;ue, if he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign of altering the natural cour&s;e of the year. But though his con&s;cience urged him upon this bold action, he could not but own the fle&s;h trembled. He had not the lea&s;t doubt, he &s;aid, but the King would immediately &s;end down an order to have him hanged. He pointed to the &s;pot where the la&s;t abbot of Gla&s;tonbury was executed for not &s;urrendering his abbey; and he gave us to under&s;tand, there were men now alive who could &s;uffer death, in a good cau&s;e, with equal fortitude. His zeal, however, was not put to this &s;evere trial. The King was more merciful than he expected; for though his Maje&s;ty did not follow his advice, it never appeared that he took the lea&s;t offence at the freedom of his letter.</P>
<P>The death of the la&s;t abbot of Gla&s;tonbury is indeed a mournful tale, as it is repre&s;ented by the writers of tho&s;e times, and was cal|culated

to make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the country.</P>
<P>This abbot is &s;aid to have been a pious and good man; careful of his charge, kind to the poor, and exemplary in his conduct. He is particularly mentioned as a man of great tem|perance; which, in a cloi&s;ter, was not, per|haps, at that day, the reigning virtue. What was &s;till as uncommon, he was a lover of learn|ing; and not only took great care of the edu|cation of tho&s;e young men, who were brought up in his hou&s;e, but was at the expence of maintaining &s;everal of them at the univer|&s;ities. He was now very old, and very in|firm; and having pa&s;&s;ed all his life in his mo|na&s;tery, knew little more of the world than he had &s;een within its walls.</P>
<P>It was the misfortune of this good abbot to live in the tyrannical days of Henry VIII., and at that period when the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries was his favourite object. Henry had applied to many of the abbots, and by threats and promi&s;es had engaged &s;everal of them to &s;urrender their tru&s;ts. But the abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, attached to his hou&s;e, and connected with his fra|ternity, refu&s;ed to &s;urrender. He was con&s;ci|ous of his own innocence; and thought guilt
<PB N="144" REF="164">
only had to fear from the inqui&s;ition that was abroad. But Henry, who&s;e haughty and im|perious &s;pirit, unu&s;ed to control, &s;oared above the trifling di&s;tinctions between innocence and guilt, was highly incen&s;ed; and determined to make an example of the abbot of Gla&s;tonbury to terrify others. An order fir&s;t came down for him to appear forthwith before the council. The difficulties of taking &s;o long a journey, appeared great to an old man, who had &s;eldom travelled beyond the limits of his mona&s;tery. But as there was no redre&s;s, he got into an ea&s;y hor&s;e-litter, and &s;et out. In his mode of travelling, we &s;ee the &s;tate and dignity, which certainly required &s;ome correction, of the great eccle&s;ia&s;tics of that age. His retinue, it is &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of not fewer than an hundred and fifty hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>The King's &s;ending for him, however, was a mere pretext. The real purpo&s;e was to pre|vent his &s;ecreting his effects; as it was never intended that he &s;hould return. Proper per|&s;ons, therefore, were commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;earch his apartments in his ab&s;ence, and &s;ecure the wealth of the mona&s;tery. His &s;teward, in the mean|time, who was a gentleman of the degree of a Knight, was corrupted to make what di&s;coveries he
<PB N="145" REF="165">
could. It was an ea&s;y matter in tho&s;e days to procure evidence, where it was already deter|mined to convict. In one of the abbot's cabi|nets &s;ome &s;trictures upon the divorce were either found, or pretended to be found. No|thing el&s;e could be obtained again&s;t him.</P>
<P>During this interval, the abbot, who knew nothing of the&s;e proceedings, waited on the council. He was treated re&s;pectfully; and in|formed, that the King would not <HI>force</HI> any man to do what he wi&s;hed him to <HI>do freely.</HI> However, as his Maje&s;ty intended to receive his final determination on the &s;pot, he was at liberty to return.</P>
<P>Being thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the abbot thought all was now over, and that he might be permitted to end his days peaceably in his beloved mo|na&s;tery.</P>
<P>He was now nearly at the end of his jour|ney, having arrived at Wells, which is within five miles of Gla&s;tonbury, when he was in|formed, that a county-court (of what kind is not &s;pecified) was convened there on that day, to which he, as abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, was &s;ummoned. He went into the court room ac|cordingly; and as his &s;tation required, was going to take his place at the upper end of it, among
<PB N="146" REF="166">
the principal gentry of the country; when the crier called him to the bar, where he was ac|cu&s;ed of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The old man, who had not the lea&s;t con|ception of the affair, was utterly a&s;toni&s;hed; and turning to his &s;teward, who &s;tood near him, a&s;ked, if he knew what could be the meaning of all this? That traitor, whi&s;pering in his ear, wi&s;hed him not to be ca&s;t down, for he knew the meaning of it was only to ter|rify him into a compliance. Though the court, therefore, on the evidence of the paper taken out of his cabinet, found him guilty of high trea&s;on, he had &s;till no idea of what was intended. From the court he was conveyed to his litter, and conducted to Gla&s;tonbury; &s;till in &s;u&s;pence how all this would end.</P>
<P>When he arrived under the walls of his abbey, the litter was ordered to &s;top; and an officer riding up to him, bad him prepare for in&s;tant death. A prie&s;t, at the &s;ame time, pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to take his confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The poor old abbot, utterly confounded at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the thing, was quite unman|ned. He begged with tears, and for God's &s;ake, they would allow him &s;ome little time for recollection. But his tears were vain.
<PB N="147" REF="167">
Might he not then ju&s;t enter his mona&s;tery; take leave of his friends; and recommend him|&s;elf to their prayers? All was to no purpo&s;e. He was dragged out of his litter, and laid upon a hurdle, to which a hor&s;e being yoked, he was drawn along the ground to the Torr, and there, to make the triumph complete, was hung up, in his monk's habit, and in &s;ight of his mona&s;tery. It was a triumph, however, that was attended with the tears and lamenta|tions of the whole country, which had long con&s;idered this pious man, as a friend, bene|factor, and father.</P>
<P>How far this &s;hocking &s;tory, in all its cir|cum&s;tances of &s;trange precipitancy, and wanton cruelty, may be depended on, con&s;idering the hands through which it is conveyed, may be matter of doubt: thus much, however, is cer|tain, that if the picture here given of the royal &s;avage of tho&s;e days be not an exact portrait, it bears evidently a &s;triking re&s;emblance.</P>

<P>HAVING given a la&s;t look at the pictu|re&s;que ruins of Gla&s;tonbury, we left them with regret. That pure &s;tyle of Gothic, in which this grand hou&s;e was compo&s;ed, it is probable, gave the key-tone in architecture to all the churches in this neighbourhood; for it is certain a better ta&s;te prevails among them, as far as we ob&s;erved, than in any other part of England through which we had travelled.</P>
<P>From Gla&s;tonbury we took the road to Bridgewater, and pa&s;&s;ed through a very fine country.</P>
<P>About three miles beyond Piper's Inn, we mounted a grand natural terrace, called the heights of Pontic.</P>
<P>On the right we had the whole range of Mendip hills, which, though incon&s;iderable in them&s;elves, made &s;ome figure in this view, with plea&s;ant &s;avannahs &s;tretching among them. Beyond the hills appeared the &s;ea, and the i&s;land of Steep-holms. The nearer grounds, between this di&s;tance and the eye, were filled
<PB N="149" REF="169">
with ample woods, which ranged, not in patches here and there di&s;per&s;ed, but in one extended &s;urface of tufted foliage; for we &s;aw little more from the heights on which we &s;tood, than the varied tops of the woods beneath us. The whole country, I believe, is a &s;cene of culti|vation; and the woods little more, in fact, than hedge-rows. But one row &s;ucceeding another, the intermediate &s;paces are concealed, together with all the regularity of that mode of plant|ing; and the whole appears, in the di&s;tance, as one va&s;t bed of foliage.</P>
<P>On the left we had the &s;ame kind of coun|try; only the hills on this &s;ide of Pontic are much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Mendip on the other. Among the &s;avannahs on this &s;ide, &s;hoot the exten&s;ive plains of Sedgmore, which &s;tretch far and wide before the eye. Here the unfor|tunate Monmouth tried his cau&s;e with his uncle James; and all the country was after|wards the &s;cene of tho&s;e acts of brutality, which Kirk and Jefferies committed, and which are &s;till remembered with horror and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>This va&s;t di&s;tance, which we &s;urveyed from the heights of Pontic, not only filled the eye with its grandeur as a whole, but was every where inter&s;per&s;ed with amu&s;ing objects, which
<PB N="150" REF="170">
adorned its &s;everal divi&s;ions. In one part Lord Chatham's obeli&s;k pointed out the do|mains of Pyn&s;ent. In another part we were told, the rich &s;cenes before us were the woods of Sir Charles Tint. The tall &s;pire which aro&s;e on the right belonged to the great church at Bridgewater; and the &s;everal little &s;pots of water, glittering under the &s;un-beams, were reaches of the river Parret,
<Q><L>Inlaying, as with molton-gla&s;s, the vale,</L>
<L>That &s;pread beyond the &s;ight.&mdash;</L></Q>
At the di&s;tance at which we &s;tood, we could not well unite all the&s;e bright &s;pots of the river into a winding cour&s;e; but the imagination ea&s;ily traced the union.</P>
<P>The di&s;tances, indeed, from the heights of Pontic, are both grand and picture&s;que; pic|ture&s;que, when thus reduced into parts; though in their immen&s;ity greatly too exten&s;ive for painting. The whole &s;cene was a tran&s;lation of a pa&s;&s;age in Virgil, bringing before our eyes,
<Q><L>&mdash;Mare velivolum, terra&s;que jacentes,</L>
<L>Littoraque, et latos populos.&mdash;</L></Q>
We have the &s;ame view el&s;ewhere:
<Q><L>&mdash;From the mountain's ridge,</L>
<L>O'er tufted tops of intervening woods,</L>
<L>Regions on regions blended in the clouds.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="171">I cannot forbear contra&s;ting this grand view with a few bold &s;trokes of di&s;tance, which Mo&s;es gives us, when he tells us, <Q>he went up from the plains of Moab to the top of Pi&s;|gah; from whence the Lord &s;hewed him all the land of Gilead unto Dan, and all Naph|tali, and the land of Ephraim and Mana&s;&s;eh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmo&s;t &s;ea; and on the &s;outh the plain of the valley of Jericho unto Zoar.</Q></P>
<P>On Mr. Hoare's terrace we had &s;een the &s;pot where Alfred the Great mu&s;tered his &s;cat|tered troops to oppo&s;e the Danes. The coun|try near Bridgewater affords a &s;cene, where, on another occa&s;ion, he appeared in a different character.</P>
<P>Where the Thone and the Parret join their waters, they form between them a piece of ground, containing about two acres, which is called the I&s;le of Athelney. In Saxon times it was not only &s;urrounded by water, but with woods and mar&s;hes to a great extent, and was in every part of very difficult acce&s;s. Here the gallant Alfred retired in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when he fled before the Danes, after the battle of Wilton. At fir&s;t he con&s;idered it only as a place of refuge, and &s;u&s;tained him&s;elf by &s;hoot|ing
<PB N="152" REF="172">
the wild deer with his arrows. But by degrees getting together a few of his friends, he fortified the i&s;land, and particularly the only avenue that led to it. From hence he often made &s;ucce&s;sful inroads upon the Dani&s;h quar|ters; and retreating among the mar&s;hes, eluded pur&s;uit. From hence too, in the habit of a min&s;trel, he made that celebrated excur&s;ion to their camp, in which, under the pretence of amu&s;ing them with his &s;ongs and buffooneries, he took an exact &s;urvey of their &s;ituation. He then laid his mea&s;ures &s;o judiciou&s;ly, and fell upon them with &s;o much well-directed fury, that he entirely broke their power during the remainder of his reign. In after-times, when &s;ucce&s;s had crowned his enterprizes, he founded a mona&s;tery in the i&s;land, in memory of the protection it had once afforded him. But its &s;ite, which had nothing to recommend it, ex|cept this per&s;onal circum&s;tance, was in all re|&s;pects &s;o inconvenient, that it never flouri&s;hed, though it exi&s;ted till the times of the di&s;&s;o|lution.</P>

<P>THERE is very little in Bridgewater, which was our next &s;tage, worth a tra|veller's attention. Its great boa&s;t is the cele|brated Blake, one of Cromwell's admirals, who was born in this town, and repre&s;ented it in &s;e|veral parliaments.</P>
<P>The name of Blake can hardly occur to an Engli&s;hman without &s;ugge&s;ting re&s;pect. If ever any man was a <HI>lover of his country,</HI> with|out being actuated by <HI>party,</HI> or <HI>any other &s;ini&s;ter motive,</HI> it was Blake. Whether in a divided commonwealth, one &s;ide or the other &s;hould be <HI>cordially cho&s;en</HI> by every citizen, is a nice que&s;|tion. Some of the ancient morali&s;ts have held the affirmative. But a man may &s;ee &s;uch errors on both &s;ides, as may render a choice difficult. This &s;eems to have been Blake's ca&s;e. The <HI>glory of his country</HI> therefore was the only part he e&s;pou&s;ed. He fought, indeed, under Cromwell; but it was merely, he would &s;ay, to <HI>aggrandize Old England.</HI> He often di&s;|liked the protector's politics. With the death
<PB N="154" REF="174">
of Charles he was particularly di&s;plea&s;ed; and was heard to mutter, that to have &s;aved the King's life, he would freely have ventured his own. But &s;till he fought on; took an im|men&s;e trea&s;ure from the Portugue&s;e; beat the Dutch in two or three de&s;perate engagements; burnt the Dey of Tunis's fleet; awed the pira|tical States; and, above all, de&s;troyed the Spa|ni&s;h plate-fleet in the harbour of Santa Cruz, which was thought a piece of the mo&s;t gallant &s;eaman&s;hip that <HI>ever</HI> was performed. Some things in the mean time happened at home which he did not like, particularly Cromwell's treatment of the Parliament: but he &s;till fought on; and would &s;ay to his captains, <HI>It is not for us to mind &s;tate matters, but to keep foreigners from fooling us.</HI> What is &s;ingular in this com|mander is, that all his knowledge in maritime affairs was acquired after he was fifty years of age. He had the theory of his profe&s;&s;ion, as it were, by intuition; and crowded as many gallant actions into nine or ten years, as might have immortalized as many commanders. One per&s;onal &s;ingularity is recorded, which gives us a &s;ort of portrait of him. When his choler was rai&s;ed, and he was bent on &s;ome de&s;perate undertaking, it was his cu&s;tom to twirl his whi&s;|kers
<PB N="155" REF="175">
with his fore-finger. Whenever that &s;ign appeared, tho&s;e about him well knew &s;ome|thing dreadful was in agitation.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>peculiarity,</HI> however, could not ea&s;ily be made intelligible in a picture; and therefore it is more proper for <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> than <HI>repre&s;entation.</HI> And yet I can conceive a portrait of Blake, in this attitude, if well managed, to have a good effect. His fleet might lie in the offing ready to &s;ail. At a di&s;tance might &s;tand a ca&s;tle, which he meant to attack, firing at his fleet, and involved in &s;moke. Blake, with a few of his officers around him, might &s;tand on the fore-ground, occupying the principal part of the picture; and ready to embark in a boat, which was waiting for them on the &s;trand. Blake him&s;elf might be repre&s;ented in the atti|tude above de&s;cribed, throwing a dreadful look at the ca&s;tle; but this dreadful look mu&s;t be in the hands of a ma&s;ter, or it will infallibly become grote&s;que and caricature. After all, though this di&s;po&s;ition might make a good picture, I know not that it would be intelli|gible enough to make a good portrait.</P>
<P>All this coa&s;t, between Bridgewater and Bri&s;tol, is low, and &s;ubject, in many parts, to overflowing tides. In the memorable &s;torm
<PB N="156" REF="176">
of November 1703, it was a melancholy &s;cene. The &s;ea broke over it with great outrage, and did &s;urpri&s;ing damage. In many places, as you travel through it, you &s;ee marks &s;et up by the country people, to &s;how how far the &s;ea poured in at that time. But, indeed, every part of the Bri&s;tol channel is &s;ubject to very high tides at all times. In Bridgewater-river it often ri&s;es in an uncommon manner, and comes forward in &s;uch rapid &s;wells, that it has been known &s;ometimes to over&s;et &s;hips. It affects the river at Bri&s;tol al&s;o, and all the rivers on the coa&s;t; and, if I am not mi&s;taken, on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t likewi&s;e.</P>

<P>AS we left Bridgewater, we drew nearer the &s;ea. In our way we pa&s;&s;ed Sir Charles Tint's plantations, which we had before &s;een as parts of a di&s;tance. They appeared now &s;tretching to a great extent along the &s;ide of a hill, and beautifully inter&s;per&s;ed with lawns. They were adorned with too many buildings, which would, however, have had a better effect, if they had not been painted white. A &s;eat or &s;mall building, painted white, may be an ad|vantage in a view: but when the&s;e white &s;pots are multiplied, the di&s;tinction of their colour detaches them from the other objects of the &s;cene, with which they ought to combine: they di&s;tract the eye, and become &s;eparate &s;pots, in&s;tead of parts of a whole.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Sir Charles Tint's, lies Enmore-ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of Lord Egmont. It is a new building, in the form of an old ca&s;tle. A dry ditch &s;urrounds it, which you
<PB N="158" REF="178">
pa&s;s by a draw-bridge. This carries you into a &s;quare court, the four &s;ides of which are oc|cupied by the apartments. It is called whim|&s;ical; and, no doubt, there is &s;omething whim|&s;ical in the idea of a man's inclo&s;ing him&s;elf, in the reign of George the Second, in a fortre&s;s that would have &s;uited the times of King Ste|phen. But if we can dive&s;t our&s;elves of this idea, Enmore-ca&s;tle &s;eems to be a comfortable dwelling, in which there is contrivance and convenience. The &s;ituation of the &s;tables &s;eems the mo&s;t whim&s;ical. You enter them through a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, on the right of the great gate. There was no occa&s;ion to carry the idea &s;o far as to lock up the hor&s;es within the ca&s;tle. If the &s;tables had been placed at &s;ome convenient di&s;tance, nobody, who &s;hould even examine the ca&s;tle under its antique idea, would ob&s;erve the impropriety; while the inconvenience, as they are placed at pre&s;ent, is evident to every one who &s;ees them.</P>
<P>But if the hou&s;e be well contrived within, it is certainly no picture&s;que object without. The towers, which occupy the corners and middle of the curtains, are all of equal height, which gives the whole an unplea&s;ing
<PB N="159" REF="179">
appearance. If the tower at the entrance had been more elevated, with a watch-hou&s;e at the top, in the manner of &s;ome old ca&s;tles, the re|gularity might &s;till have been ob&s;erved; and the per&s;pective in every point, except exactly in the front, would have given the whole a more plea&s;ing form.</P>
<P>But even with this addition, Enmore-ca&s;tle would be, in a picture&s;que light, only a very indifferent copy of its original. The old baronial ca&s;tle, in its ancient &s;tate, even before it had received from time the beau|ties of ruin, was certainly a more plea&s;ing object than we have in this imitation of it. The <HI>form</HI> of Enmore is &s;acrificed to <HI>conveni|ence.</HI> To make the apartments regular within, the walls are regular without. Whereas our ance&s;tors had no idea of uniformity. If one tower was &s;quare and low, the other, perhaps, would be round and lofty. The curtain too was irregular, following the declivity or pro|jection of the hill on which it &s;tood. It was adorned al&s;o with watch-towers, here and there, at unequal di&s;tances. Nor were the windows more regular, either in form or &s;ituation, than the internal parts of the ca&s;tle, which they en|lightened. Some jutting corner of a detached
<PB N="160" REF="180">
hill was al&s;o probably fortified with a project|ing tower. A large buttre&s;s or two perhaps propped the wall, in &s;ome part, where the at|tack of an enemy had made it weak: while the <HI>keep,</HI> ri&s;ing above the ca&s;tle, formed gene|rally a grand apex to the whole. Amid&s;t all this ma&s;s of irregularity, the lines would be broken, the light often beautifully received, and vari|ous points of view pre&s;ented, &s;ome of which would be exceedingly picture&s;que. Whereas En|more-ca&s;tle, &s;een in every point of view, pre|&s;ents a face of <HI>unvaried &s;amene&s;s.</HI> Even taken in per&s;pective, it affords no variety. We &s;ee three &s;imilar towers, with two &s;imilar curtains between them, on one &s;ide; and three &s;imilar towers, with two &s;imilar curtains between them, on the other. On the whole, therefore, as it obtains no <HI>particular convenience</HI> from its ca&s;tle-form, and evidently no <HI>particular beauty,</HI> it might, perhaps, have been as well if the no|ble founder had built, like other people, on a modern plan.</P>

<P>FROM Enmore-ca&s;tle we a&s;cended Quantoc-hills. Our views from the heights of Pon|tic were chiefly <HI>inland;</HI> but from the high grounds here, as we now approached the &s;ea, we were entertained with beautiful coa&s;t-views, which make a very agreable &s;pecies of land|&s;cape.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene of this kind was compo&s;ed of Bridgewater-bay, and the land around it. We &s;aw indeed the two i&s;lands of Flat-holms and Steep-holms, and the Wel&s;h coa&s;t beyond them; but they were wrapped in the ambiguity of a hazy atmo&s;phere, which was of no ad|vantage to the view. Hazine&s;s has often a good effect in a picture&s;que &s;cene. The variety of objects, &s;hapes, and hues which compo&s;e an exten&s;ive land&s;cape, though inharmonious in them&s;elves, may be harmoniou&s;ly united by one general tinge &s;pread over them. But here the land bore &s;o &s;mall a proportion to the water, that as we could not have a <HI>picture,</HI> and ex|pected only <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> we wi&s;hed for more di&s;|tinctne&s;s.
<PB N="162" REF="182">
We had it &s;oon; for before we left our &s;tation, a light breeze ari&s;ing from the we&s;t &s;wept away the vapours: the di&s;tant coa&s;t became di&s;tinct, and many a little white &s;ail appeared in different parts of the channel, which had been lo&s;t before in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The <HI>going off</HI> of mi&s;ts and fogs is among the mo&s;t beautiful circum&s;tances belonging to them. While the ob&s;curity is only <HI>partially</HI> clearing away, it often occa&s;ions a plea&s;ing contra&s;t be|tween the <HI>formed</HI> and <HI>unformed</HI> parts of a land|&s;cape; and like cleaning a dirty picture, plea&s;es the eye with &s;eeing one part after another emerge into brightne&s;s. It has its effect al&s;o, when it goes off more &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>The exhibition we ju&s;t had of the fog's leav|ing the Welch coa&s;t, was a <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> one; but where there is a <HI>coincidence of grand ob|jects under &s;uch circum&s;tances,</HI> the exhibition is often <HI>&s;ublime.</HI> One of the grande&s;t I remember to have met with was pre&s;ented at the late &s;iege of Gibraltar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Drinkwater's Journal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was near day-break on the 12th of April 1781, when a me&s;&s;age was brought from the
<PB N="163" REF="183">
&s;ignal-hou&s;e at the &s;ummit of the rock, that the long expected fleet, under Admiral Darby, was in &s;ight. Innumerable ma&s;ts were ju&s;t di&s;|cerned from that lofty &s;ituation; but could not be &s;een from the lower parts of the ca&s;tle, being ob&s;cured by a thick fog, which had &s;et in from the we&s;t, and totally over&s;pread the opening of the &s;traits. In this uncertainty the garri&s;on remained &s;ome time; while the fleet, inve&s;ted in ob&s;curity, moved &s;lowly towards the ca&s;tle. In the mean time, the &s;un becoming powerful, the fog ro&s;e like the curtain of a va&s;t theatre, and di&s;covered <HI>at once</HI> the whole fleet, full and di&s;tinct before the eye. The convoy, con&s;i&s;t|ing of near a hundred ve&s;&s;els, were in a com|pact body, led on by twenty-eight &s;ail of the line, and a number of tenders and other &s;maller ve&s;&s;els. A gentle wind ju&s;t filled their &s;ails, and brought them forward with a &s;low and &s;olemn motion. Had all this grand exhibition been pre&s;ented <HI>gradually,</HI> the &s;ublimity of it would have been injured by the acquaintance the eye would have made with it, during its approach; but the appearance of it in all its greatne&s;s <HI>at once,</HI> before the eye had examined the detail, had a wonderful effect.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="184">To this account of a grand effect from the clearing away of a fog, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin another, which, though of the horrid kind, is grand and &s;ublime in the highe&s;t degree. It is taken from Captain Meares's voyage from China to the northern latitudes of America. That navi|gator, having gained the inho&s;pitable coa&s;t he was in pur&s;uit of, was &s;ailing among unknown bays and gulphs, when he was &s;uddenly im|mer&s;ed in &s;o thick a fog, that the &s;eamen could not even di&s;cern an object from one end of the &s;hip to the other. Night too came on, which rendered every thing &s;till more di&s;mal. While the unhappy crew were ruminating on the va|riety of di&s;tre&s;&s;es that &s;urrounded them, about midnight they were alarmed with the &s;ound of waves bur&s;ting and da&s;hing among rocks, with|in a little di&s;tance of the head of the &s;hip. In|&s;tantly turning the helm, they tacked about. But they had &s;ailed only a &s;hort way in this new direction, when they were terrified with the &s;ame dreadful notes a &s;econd time. They altered their cour&s;e again: but the &s;ame tre|mendous &s;ound again recurred. At length day came on; but the fog continuing as inten&s;e as before, they could &s;ee nothing. All they knew was, that they were &s;urrounded by rocks on
<PB N="165" REF="185">
every &s;ide; but how to e&s;cape they had no idea. Once, during a momentary interruption of the fog, they got a glimp&s;e of the &s;ummit of an immen&s;e cliff, covered with &s;now, tower|ing over the ma&s;t. But the fog in&s;tantly &s;hut it in. A more dreadful &s;ituation cannot ea&s;ily be conceived. They had &s;teered in every di|rection, but always found they were land-locked; and though they were continually clo&s;e to the &s;hore, on &s;ounding they could find no bottom. Their anchors therefore were of no u&s;e. Four days they continued in this dreadful &s;u&s;pence, tacking from &s;ide to &s;ide: on the 5th the fog cleared away, and they had a view at once of the terrors that &s;urrounded them. They had, by &s;ome &s;trange accident, found their way into a bay, invironed on all &s;ides with precipices of immen&s;e height, covered with &s;now, and falling down to the water, in lofty rocks, which were every where perpendi|cular, except in &s;ome parts where the con&s;tant beating of the &s;urge had hollowed them into caverns. The &s;ound they heard was from the waters &s;welling and ru&s;hing into the&s;e caverns, which ab&s;orbing them, drove them out again with great fury again&s;t the rocks at their mouths, da&s;hing them into foam with a tre|mendous
<PB N="166" REF="186">
&s;ound. Captain Meares now per|ceived the pa&s;&s;age, through which he had been driven into this &s;cene of horrors, and made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>On reading &s;uch accounts as the&s;e in a pic|ture&s;que light, one can hardly avoid making a few remarks on the grand effects which may often be produced by, what may be called, <HI>the &s;cenery of vapour.</HI> Nothing offers &s;o exten&s;ive a field to the fancy in <HI>invented</HI> &s;cenes; nothing &s;ubjects even the <HI>compo&s;itions of nature</HI> &s;o much to the control and improvement of art. It admits the painter to a participation with the poet in the u&s;e of the machinery of <HI>uncertain forms;</HI> to which both are indebted for their <HI>&s;ublime&s;t images.</HI> A <HI>&s;ublime image</HI> is perhaps an incorrect phra&s;e. The regions of &s;ublimity are not peopled by <HI>forms,</HI> but <HI>hints;</HI> they are not enlightened by <HI>&s;un&s;hine,</HI> but by <HI>gleams</HI> and <HI>fla&s;hes.</HI> The tran&s;ient view of the &s;ummit of a cliff towering over the ma&s;t, filled the de&s;pair|ing &s;eaman with more terror than if he had &s;een the whole rocky bay. It &s;et his imagi|nation at work. The ideas of <HI>grace and beauty</HI> are as much rai&s;ed by leaving the image half

<P>As we proceeded farther along the heights of Quantoc, we had views of the promontory of Minehead, which forms a more beautiful coa&s;t than Bridgewater-bay: the land is higher and more varied. Here we had &s;till a di&s;tinct view of the Bri&s;tol channel, and the coa&s;t of
<PB N="168" REF="189">
Wales. The &s;ea, as is not uncommon, hap|pened to be beautifully variegated. It had a reddi&s;h hue with a tinge of rainbow green, which being mixed together, formed different gradations of kindred colours; and &s;ometimes going off in purple, gave the &s;urface of the ocean a great re&s;plendency.</P>
<P>Minehead &s;eems by its &s;ituation to confirm what we were told, that its harbour was the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t in this part of the coa&s;t. When the great &s;torm of 1703 ravaged all the&s;e &s;hores with peculiar fury, Minehead was the only harbour which could defend it's &s;hipping. It is chiefly u&s;eful in the Iri&s;h trade, as it lies in the midway between Ireland and Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>In &s;o ordinary a town as Watchet, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o hand&s;ome a pier. But in many of the ports along this coa&s;t, though incon&s;iderable in appearance, we &s;ee a great air of bu&s;ine&s;s. This little Mediterranean is crowded with &s;kiffs pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing; and has a bri&s;k trade within it&s;elf in corn, metals, lime-&s;tone, and other commodities. The coa&s;t about Watchet is very rocky; and the crevices of the rocks are curiou&s;ly veined with alaba&s;ter,
<PB N="169" REF="190">
which makes a part of the traffic of the place. But the &s;tone from which the greate&s;t advan|tage is derived, is a kind of pebble, found on the &s;hore, when the tide leaves it. The&s;e peb|bles burn into lime of &s;o peculiar a texture, that when placed under water, it a&s;&s;umes its original hardne&s;s. Even when pulverized, and laid upon land, it is turned into a kind of hard grit by the fir&s;t &s;hower of rain. In the found|ation of bridges, therefore, and all &s;tone-work, which lies under water, the lime of Watchet is exceedingly valued. A &s;pecies of this kind of lime, Mr. Bryant informs us, was in u&s;e among the Romans: the foundation-&s;tones particu|larly of the great mole at Puteoli were united by this cement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bryant's Di&s;&s;ert. on the Wind Euroclydon, p. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Watchet we pur&s;ued our route along the coa&s;t. The promontory of Minehead &s;till continued the principal feature of the view. As we approached it, a woody hill, which in the di&s;tance adhered to the promontory, began more and more to detach it&s;elf from it: and as we came &s;till nearer we di&s;covered a light airy building on its &s;ummit, which by degrees ap|peared
<PB N="170" REF="191">
to be an unfini&s;hed edifice with its &s;caf|folding about it. In this condition it has pro|bably a more picture&s;que effect than it will have, when it has completely taken the form which &s;eems to be intended. At a di&s;tance it had the appearance of the Sibyl's temple at Tivoli: the tower is round, and the &s;caffolding annexed the idea of a range of ruined pillars &s;upporting the roof.</P>
<P>As we turned a little from the &s;ea, Dun&s;ter-ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of Mr. Lutterell, opened before us at about the di&s;tance of half a mile, and made a &s;triking appearance. It is, indeed, on the whole, one of the grande&s;t artificial objects we had met with on our journey. Its towers, which are picture&s;que, ari&s;e near the &s;ummit of a woody hill, which &s;eems connected with an|other hill, much higher, though it is in fact de|tached from it. This apparent union makes the compo&s;ition more agreable, and is of great advantage to the view. It takes away that idea of art which an in&s;ulated hill would be apt to rai&s;e. The con&s;equence of this grand object is greatly increa&s;ed by a <HI>dead flat</HI> between it and the eye. <HI>Broken ground</HI> in
<PB REF="192">

<PB N="171" REF="193">
it&s;elf is more beautiful; but a <HI>flat</HI> often carries the eye more directly to a capital object, with which al&s;o it often very agreably contra&s;ts. I &s;peak, however, undecidedly, becau&s;e &s;ome|times it is otherwi&s;e. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e we thought the approach by a flat had a good effect.</P>
<P>From the terrace of the ca&s;tle we had a great variety of amu&s;ing land&s;capes; though nothing very intere&s;ting. We obtained a good idea, however, of the form of the country; and found that Dun&s;ter-ca&s;tle, which &s;tands high, is &s;urrounded, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, by grounds that are much higher. In this amu&s;ing circle round the walls of the ca&s;tle, we had three di&s;tinct &s;pecies of land&s;cape, a <HI>park-&s;cene;</HI> a tract of <HI>mountainous country;</HI> and a <HI>&s;ea-coa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the civil wars, Dun&s;ter-ca&s;tle had a re&s;pectable name; and was con&s;idered as one of the &s;tronge&s;t of the King's garri&s;ons in the we&s;t. When his affairs were in the wane after the battle of Nai&s;by, it was fixed on as the be&s;t place of refuge for the Prince of Wales; but the plague immediately breaking out in the town of Dun&s;ter, &s;ome other place of &s;ecurity was &s;ought for.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="194">At Dun&s;ter, we were told, there is a very elegant Gothic church, built in the time of Henry VII. when it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed Gothic architecture was in its pure&s;t &s;tate; though I think it was rather, as all arts end in refinement, at that period, on the decline. Whether this church, however, were of elegant architecture, or not, the late intelligence we received did not &s;uffer us to examine. We had already left the place; and when there, had conceived the ca&s;tle to be the only thing worth vi&s;iting.</P>
<P>From Dun&s;ter, in our route to Dulverton, we had a plea&s;ant ride for half a dozen miles, through a winding valley, and along the &s;ides of hills on the left, which came &s;loping down with their woody &s;kirts to the road. But we &s;oon exchanged the&s;e vallies for a naked open country; and the woody hills for dreary &s;lopes, cut into portions, by naked hedges, unadorned by a &s;ingle tree.</P>
<P>As we left Dulverton, in our way to Tiver|ton, we entered another plea&s;ing valley, wooded
<PB N="173" REF="195">
thick with oaks, which climbed a &s;teep on the right, and formed a hanging grove. On the left ran the Ex, a rapid rocky-channelled &s;tream, &s;haded likewi&s;e with trees. Beyond the Ex, the ground ro&s;e in a beautiful park-&s;cene; in the mid&s;t of which &s;tands the hou&s;e of Sir Thomas Acland.</P>
<P>From hence to Tiverton the country affords nothing that is &s;triking. We had hills; but they were tame and uniform, following each other in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that we rarely found either a foreground or a di&s;tance. As we mounted one, we had another immediately in view. At Tiverton are the remains of a ca&s;tle, which was formerly the man&s;ion of the earls of Devon&s;hire.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>FROM hence we travelled through the &s;ame kind of hilly country towards Barn&s;taple. In our way we turned a&s;ide to &s;ee Lord For|te&s;cue's at Ca&s;tlehill, where we did not think we were &s;ufficiently repaid for going &s;o far out of our way. Lord Forte&s;cue has improved a large tract of ground; but with no great ta&s;te or contrivance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will recollect this was written &s;everal years ago; and that many alterations may &s;ince have been made.</NOTE>. Into one error he has parti|cularly fallen, that of over-building his im|provements. From one &s;tand we counted eight or nine buildings. This is the common error of improvers. It is a much ea&s;ier matter to erect a temple, or a Palladian bridge, than to improve a piece of ground with &s;implicity and beauty, and give it the air of nature. One of his buildings, an old ca&s;tle upon a hill, from which his place, I &s;uppo&s;e, takes its name, &s;tands beautifully. Little more, I &s;hould think, in the way of building, would have been ne|ce&s;&s;ary.
<PB N="175" REF="197">
This lofty ca&s;tle might be object &s;uf|ficient from almo&s;t every part of his improve|ments.</P>
<P>As we approached Barn&s;taple, the view from &s;ome of the high grounds is very grand, com|po&s;ed on one &s;ide of Barn&s;taple-bay, and on the other of an exten&s;ive vale; the vale of Taunton carrying the eye far and wide into its rich and ample bo&s;om. It is one of tho&s;e views which is too great a &s;ubject for painting. Art, confined by the rules of picture&s;que com|po&s;ition, mu&s;t keep within the compa&s;s of inch, foot, and yard. But &s;uch &s;lender confines cannot rou&s;e the imagination like the&s;e exten|&s;ive &s;cenes of nature. The painter, jealous of his art, will &s;ometimes deny this. If the pic|ture, he tells us, be well painted, the &s;ize is nothing. His canvas (however diminutive) has the effect of nature, and deceives the eye. You are affected, &s;ays he, by a land&s;cape &s;een <HI>through the pane of a window.</HI> Why may you not be equally affected by a land&s;cape <HI>well painted within the &s;ame dimen&s;ions?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, the eye is frequently impo&s;ed upon. It is often <HI>purpo&s;ely</HI> mi&s;led by <HI>tricks</HI> of deception.
<PB N="176" REF="198">
But it is not under the idea of deception, that the <HI>real</HI> arti&s;t paints. He does not mean to <HI>impo&s;e</HI> upon us, by making us believe that a picture of a foot long is an extended land&s;cape. All he wi&s;hes is, to give &s;uch <HI>characteri&s;tic touches</HI> to his picture, as may be able to rou&s;e the imagi|nation of the beholder. The picture is not &s;o much the <HI>ultimate end,</HI> as it is the <HI>medium,</HI> through which the ravi&s;hing &s;cenes of nature are excited in the imagination.&mdash;We do in|deed examine a picture likewi&s;e by the rules of picture&s;que compo&s;ition: but <HI>this mode</HI> of examination we are not now con&s;idering. The rules of compo&s;ition &s;erve only to make the picture an&s;wer more effectually its <HI>ultimate end.</HI> We are now con&s;idering only the effect which the picture produces on the mind of the &s;pec|tator, by carrying him forcibly, and yet will|ingly, with his <HI>eyes open,</HI> into tho&s;e &s;cenes which it de&s;cribes.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t the &s;ame in every &s;pecies of paint|ing. The portrait-painter mu&s;t rai&s;e the idea of wit, or humour, or integrity, or good &s;en&s;e, or piety, or dignity, in the character of the per|&s;on who&s;e portrait he repre&s;ents, or he does nothing. In hi&s;tory too, unle&s;s the picture rou&s;e the imagination to &s;omething more than
<PB N="177" REF="199">
you &s;ee on the canvas, it leaves half its work undone. You coolly critici&s;e it indeed by <HI>pic|ture&s;que rules.</HI> But that is not all. It ought to rai&s;e in you tho&s;e ideas and &s;entiments which paint cannot expre&s;s; that is, it &s;hould produce &s;omething <HI>in you,</HI> which the painter could not produce <HI>on his canvas.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, then, the <HI>true enjoyment of the picture</HI> depends chiefly on the <HI>imagination of the &s;pectator;</HI> and as the utmo&s;t the land&s;cape-painter can do, is to <HI>excite the ideas</HI> of tho&s;e de|lightful &s;cenes which he repre&s;ents, it follows, that <HI>tho&s;e &s;cenes them&s;elves</HI> mu&s;t have a much greater effect on the imagination, than any <HI>re|pre&s;entation</HI> of them which he can give; that is, the idea mu&s;t be much more &s;trongly ex|cited by the <HI>original,</HI> than by a <HI>repre&s;entative.</HI> The fact is, art is a mere trifler compared with Nature. The efforts of both, it is true, may be called the works of God: but the difference lies here.

<P>THE approach to Barn&s;table from the lower grounds, is as beautiful as from the higher. The river, the bridge, the hills beyond it, and the e&s;tuary in the di&s;tance, make all together a good land&s;cape. The town it&s;elf al&s;o, &s;ituated about nine or ten miles from the &s;ea, &s;tands in a plea&s;ant vale, &s;hut in by hills, forming a &s;e|milunar cove around it. When the tides are high, it is almo&s;t in&s;ulated. The flat grounds which lie immediately about it make an agree|able contra&s;t with the hills. Once the&s;e grounds were little better than mar&s;hes; but by proper draining, they are now become beautiful mea|dows. In a word, Barn&s;table is the plea&s;ante&s;t town we met with in the we&s;t of England.</P>
<P>From hence to Torrington the country is unintere&s;ting; but between Torrington and Oakhampton it a&s;&s;umed a better appearance. In &s;ome parts of it we had grand di&s;tances; in other parts hanging woods; particularly a
<PB N="179" REF="201">
very noble one belonging to Mr. Harris, which travelled with us a con&s;iderable way on the left, and afforded us a view &s;ometimes over it, and &s;ometimes through it, but at all times plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>From Oakhampton we vi&s;ited the falls of Lidford, which compo&s;e the mo&s;t celebrated piece of &s;cenery in this country.</P>
<P>Lidford was formerly a town of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in England. In William the Con|queror's time it was taxed pretty nearly on an equality with London. As tin was at that time the &s;taple commodity of the country, Lidford might draw its con&s;equence from being one of the principal marts of that metal. Here afterwards a &s;tannery-court was kept. The ca&s;tle, in which it was held, is &s;till in being. It is a large &s;quare tower, rather out of repair, than in ruin. Near it &s;tands the pari&s;h church; and at a di&s;tance we had a view of another church, loftily &s;eated, called Brentor. But the falls of Lidford are a mile and half from the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In our way, we were to pa&s;s a bridge, which, we were informed, was thrown over the rocky
<PB N="180" REF="202">
&s;ides of two frightful precipices of the river Lid, each eighty feet high. The idea was ter|rific; and we expected a very grand &s;cene. But we were di&s;appointed, from the omi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle circum&s;tance in the intelligence, which was, that the &s;eparation between the&s;e two tre|mendous precipices is little more than the cre|vice of a rock; and, in fact, we had pa&s;&s;ed it before we knew we had been upon it. It is only &s;een by looking over the battlements of the bridge. If the day be clear, you ju&s;t di&s;|cover the river foaming among rocks many fa|thoms below. If not, you mu&s;t be content with li&s;tening to its roar. The mu&s;ic, how|ever, is grand; for if the river be full, the notes &s;well nobly from the bottom, varied, as they are, by a&s;cending &s;o narrow and broken a funnel.</P>
<P>We were told a &s;tory of a London rider, who travelled this road in a &s;tormy night; and being de&s;irous to e&s;cape the rain, as quickly as he could, pu&s;hed his hor&s;e with what exertion his whip and &s;purs could excite. The next morning he heard that Lidford bridge had been carried away in the night, when he recollected that his hor&s;e had made a &s;ingular bound in the middle of its cour&s;e. In fact, he had &s;een bet|ter
<PB N="181" REF="203">
in the dark than his ma&s;ter, and had &s;aved both his own life and his rider's by &s;pringing over the cha&s;m.</P>
<P>In the back &s;ettlements of Virginia, at the bottom of the Allegeny mountains, near a place called Stanton, there is a &s;pecimen of this mode of &s;cenery in a very grand &s;tyle. A valley winds &s;everal leagues in length, and yet is &s;carce any where more than a hundred feet wide; though in many places it is two hun|dred and fifty deep. It is adorned in various parts with rock; and &s;ecured by lofty moun|tains, covered with wood. This valley, through much of its cour&s;e, is little more than the chan|nel of a con&s;iderable river. But in one part the rocks approximate &s;o nearly as to form a complete natural arch, not only over the river, but over the valley it&s;elf. When Nature <HI>mi|mics</HI> (if I may &s;o &s;peak) the works of man, for bridges are not a natural production, you &s;ee the comparative magnificence of her operations not only in their va&s;tne&s;s, but in the carele&s;s &s;implicity with which they are wrought. When the hand of man throws an arch over a river or a cha&s;m, he piles up a number of little &s;tones or bricks, fixing them with cement carefully and painfully, one upon
<PB N="182" REF="204">
another, in a certain regular &s;hape. All is nicety, exactne&s;s, and preci&s;ion. If one &s;tone be fixed awry, the whole &s;tructure is endan|gered. But when Nature throws an arch, her fir&s;t operation perhaps is, to bury deep in the &s;oil one end of &s;ome va&s;t diagonal or hori|zontal &s;tratum of rock, flinging the other end athwart over the cha&s;m; or, if that be not &s;ufficient, &s;he unites it perhaps to the fragment of a rock, formed in the &s;ame manner on the other &s;ide of a valley. Sometimes &s;he works in a &s;till grander &s;tyle, and forms her arch of one &s;ingle ma&s;s of perforated &s;tone, which in <HI>her</HI> way &s;he hews into a va&s;t irregular &s;urface. In both operations it is evident a variety of forms mu&s;t re&s;ult. Sometimes the arch is pointed; &s;ometimes it is flat and horizontal; and often varied into &s;ome namele&s;s form. When the grand ma&s;s of the edifice is thus reared, Nature proceeds to ornament. She leaves the cornice and the balu&s;trade to human arti&s;ts. Her ornaments are of a different kind. She fir&s;t &s;preads the whole over with &s;oil. In the American arch here &s;pecified, the thickne&s;s of the &s;oil, including the &s;ub&s;tratum of rock, is at lea&s;t forty feet. This is a depth of &s;oil &s;uffi|cient for trees of con&s;iderable &s;ize; many of
<PB N="183" REF="205">
which adorn the arch. Among the&s;e Nature has planted various &s;hrubs and hanging bu&s;hes, which are often highly coloured, and, &s;tream|ing down, wave in the wind in great profu&s;ion. Then perhaps with one of her broade&s;t pencils &s;he da&s;hes the &s;ides of the rock with a thou|&s;and beautiful &s;tains from mo&s;&s;es, and other in|cru&s;ted vegetation of various kinds, which fini&s;h and complete the operation.</P>
<Q><L>Thus Nature works, as if to mock at Art,</L>
<L>And in defiance of her rival powers.</L>

<P>Such an arch is the American one we are now &s;urveying; which, on the authority of an eye-witne&s;s, I have heard de&s;cribed as a mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructure of the kind. Sometimes, I under&s;tand, when the water is low, the tra|veller may walk under it, &s;urvey its ma&s;&s;y abutments, and looking up admire its tremen|dous roof, rai&s;ed at the va&s;t height of at lea&s;t two hundred feet above his head, and fro&s;ted over with various knobs and rocky protube|rances, which have &s;tood for ages, though they continually threaten ruin. When he hath &s;a|tisfied his curio&s;ity below, he may find a path,
<PB N="184" REF="206">
which leads him to the top. There he meets a commodious road which is the only pa&s;&s;age the inhabitants have over the valley. He finds al&s;o, in different parts, a rude rocky parapet; and if his curio&s;ity carry him farther, he may cling to &s;ome well-rooted plant, and have a perpendicular view to the river below, as ter|rific as the view he had ju&s;t had over his head. He will probably &s;ee al&s;o on one &s;ide, the river as it approaches, and on the other as it retires. Many beauties, I doubt not, might likewi&s;e be pointed out from this &s;tation. But what I have heard chiefly noticed, are the rocky hills which environ the valley, and &s;hoot into it, here and there, in va&s;t promontories, covered with &s;tately pines and oaks, which perhaps flouri&s;hed, as they now do, in the days of Co|lumbus. Let us now return to humbler &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The channel of the Lid, though contracted at the bridge, &s;oon widens, both below it and above, and would afford many beautiful &s;cenes to tho&s;e who had lei&s;ure to explore them. This river ri&s;es about three or four miles above Lidford, on the edge of Dartmore, and flowing through a barren plain, finds a &s;mall rocky barrier, through which it has, in a cour&s;e of ages, worn a whim&s;ical pa&s;&s;age. As it i&s;&s;ues
<PB REF="207">

<PB N="185" REF="208">
from the check it meets with here, it falls about thirty feet into a &s;mall dell, which was not repre&s;ented to us as a &s;cene of much beauty. But a little farther the banks ri&s;e on each &s;ide; vegetation riots, the &s;tream de&s;cends by a winding and rapid cour&s;e; and the &s;kreens, though &s;mall, are often beautifully adorned with wood and rock. By this time the river approaches the bridge, where it is lo&s;t in the narrowne&s;s of the channel, and, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, becomes almo&s;t &s;ubterranean.</P>
<P>From the bridge we proceeded directly to what are emphatically called <HI>the falls of Lid|ford,</HI> which are about three miles below. We alighted at a farm-hou&s;e, and were conducted on foot to the brow of a &s;teep woody hill, from which we had a grand view of Lidford-ca&s;tle, which appeared now, at a di&s;tance, more proudly &s;eated than it &s;eemed to be when we rode pa&s;t it. Of the river we &s;aw nothing, but could ea&s;ily make out its channel, under the abutments of grand promontories, which marked its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Having viewed this noble land&s;cape, we de|&s;cended the hill by a difficult winding path, and at the bottom found the Lid. The appear|ance which the river and its appendages made
<PB N="186" REF="209">
here from the lower grounds were equally plea&s;ing, though not &s;o grand as from the higher. Indeed no part of this magnificent &s;cenery would be a di&s;grace to the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t picture&s;que country.</P>
<P>The <HI>fall of the river,</HI> which brought us hi|ther, and which is the lea&s;t con&s;iderable part of the &s;cenery, (for we had heard nothing of the&s;e <HI>noble views,</HI>) is a mere garden-&s;cene. The &s;teep woody hilt, who&s;e &s;haggy &s;ides we had de&s;cended, forms at the bottom, in one of its envelopes, a &s;ort of little woody theatre; ra|ther indeed too lofty when compared with its breadth, if Nature had been as exact as Art would have been, in ob&s;erving proportion. Down the central part of it, which is lined with &s;mooth rock, the river falls. This rocky cheek is narrow at the top, but it widens as it de&s;cends, taking probably the form of the &s;tream, when it is full. At the time we &s;aw it, it was rather a &s;pout than a ca&s;cade; for though it &s;lides down a hundred and eighty feet, it does not meet one ob&s;truction in its whole cour&s;e, except a little check in the middle. When the &s;prings are low, and the water has not quantity enough to pu&s;h it&s;elf forward in one current, I have been told, it &s;ometimes falls
<PB N="187" REF="210">
in various little &s;treams again&s;t the irregulari|ties of the rock, and is da&s;hed into a kind of vapoury rain, which has a good effect.</P>
<P>This ca&s;cade, it &s;eems, is not formed by the waters of the Lid, as we had &s;uppo&s;ed from its name; but by a little &s;tream, which runs into that river, ri&s;ing in the higher grounds, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the ca&s;cade.</P>

<P>FROM Lidford we found a cheerful coun|try to Tavi&s;tock. In our way we pa&s;&s;ed Brentor, which we had &s;een at a di&s;tance when we fir&s;t &s;aw the ca&s;tle of Lidford. It is &s;eated on the top of a mountain, and was enveloped, when we rode pa&s;t it, in all the maje&s;ty of darkne&s;s. In fact, it was &s;o much immer&s;ed in clouds, that we could not even di&s;tingui&s;h its form; and if we had not &s;een it before at a di&s;tance, we &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to have known what it was; though we &s;hould certainly have thought it rather a ca&s;tle than a church. How very lofty its &s;ituation is, may be &s;uppo&s;ed from its being a good &s;ea-mark in opening Plymouth harbour, though it &s;tands at the di&s;tance of twenty miles from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>At Tavi&s;tock, from the appearance which the river Tavey makes at the bridge, it is pro|bable there may be &s;ome beautiful &s;cenes along its banks, but we had not time to explore them.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="212">As to the abbey, though it was once of mi|tred dignity, and though a con&s;iderable por|tion of it &s;till remains, we did not ob&s;erve a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age that was worth our notice. What is left is worked up into barns, mills, and dwell|ing-hou&s;es. It may give the antiquarian plea|&s;ure to rever&s;e all this metamorpho&s;is; to trace back the &s;table to the Abbott's lodge; the mill to the refectory; and the malt-hou&s;e to the chapel: but the picture&s;que eye is &s;o far from looking at the&s;e deeds of economy under the idea of plea&s;ure, that it pa&s;&s;es by them with di&s;dain, as heterogeneous ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>From Tavi&s;tock our next &s;tage was to Laun|ce&s;ton, through what &s;eemed an unplea&s;ant country. But the whole road was involved in &s;o thick a fog, that we &s;aw but little of it. Where we could have wi&s;hed the fog to clear up, it fortunately did, at a place called Ax|worthy. Here we de&s;cended a &s;teep winding woody hill, through the trees of which we had beautiful views of tufted groves, and other ob|jects on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. At the bottom we found the Tamar, a fine &s;tream, adorned with a picture&s;que bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="213">The road &s;oon brought us to Launce&s;ton, the capital of Cornwall, which is a hand&s;ome town. The ca&s;tle was formerly e&s;teemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es of the we&s;t, as we may &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t from the name it bore, which was that of <HI>Ca&s;tle-terrible.</HI> During the civil wars of Charles I. It continued among the la&s;t &s;upports of the royal cau&s;e in tho&s;e parts: though it has &s;uffered great dilapi|dations &s;ince that time, its remains are &s;till re|&s;pectable; and, what is more to the purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent, they are picture&s;que. The great gate and road up to it, and the towers that adorn it, make a good picture. The &s;tately citadel makes a &s;till better. It is rai&s;ed on a lofty eminence, and con&s;i&s;ts of a round tower, en|compa&s;&s;ed by the ruins of a circular wall; in which, through a wide breach, you di&s;cover the internal &s;tructure to more advantage. The con&s;truction of this whole fortre&s;s is thought to have been very curious; and they who wi&s;h to have a full account of it, may be gra|tified in Borla&s;e's Hi&s;tory of Cornwall.</P>

<P><PB N="191" REF="215">A little to the north of Launce&s;ton lies Wer|rington, an e&s;tate belonging to the Duke of Northumberland. The park contains many beautiful &s;cenes, con&s;i&s;ting of hanging lawns and woods, with a con&s;iderable &s;tream, the Aire, running through it. In &s;ome parts, where the ground is high, the views are exten&s;ive. Many antiquarians &s;uppo&s;e this to have been the &s;eat of Orgar Earl of Devon&s;hire, who&s;e beautiful daughter, Elfrida, is the &s;ubject of one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;tories in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and one of the pure&s;t dramatic com|po&s;itions in the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P>Somewhere in this neighbourhood lived Thoma&s;ine Percival; at what time, I find not; but the &s;tory of this extraordinary woman is &s;till current in the country. She was originally a poor girl, and being beautiful, had the fortune to marry a rich clothier, who dying early, left her a well-jointured widow. A &s;econd advan|tageous match, and a &s;econd widowhood, in|crea&s;ed her jointure. Being yet in the bloom of youth and beauty, her third hu&s;band was Sir John Percival, a wealthy merchant of Lon|don, of which he was Lord Mayor. He al&s;o
<PB N="192" REF="216">
left her a widow with a large acce&s;&s;ion of for|tune. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this accumulated property &s;he retired to her native country, where &s;he &s;pent her time and fortune altogether in works of genero&s;ity and charity. She repaired roads, built bridges, pen&s;ioned poor people, and por|tioned poor girls, &s;etting an example, which &s;hould never be forgotten among the extraor|dinary things of this country.</P>
<P>From Launce&s;ton we travelled as far into Cornwall as Bodmin, through a coar&s;e naked country, and in all re&s;pects as unintere&s;ting as can well be conceived. Of wood, in every &s;hape, it was utterly de&s;titute.</P>
<P>Having heard that the country beyond Bod|min was exactly like what we had already pa&s;&s;ed, we re&s;olved to travel no farther in Cornwall; and in&s;tead of vi&s;iting the Land's-end, as we had intended, we took the road to Le&s;card, propo&s;ing to vi&s;it Plymouth in our return.</P>
<P>An antiquarian, it is probable, might find more amu&s;ement in Cornwall than in almo&s;t any country in England. Even along the road
<PB N="193" REF="217">
we &s;aw &s;tones, and other objects, which &s;eemed to bear marks both of curio&s;ity and antiquity. Some of the &s;tones appear plainly to be monu|mental: the famous <HI>Hurlers</HI> we did not &s;ee.</P>
<P>The naturali&s;t al&s;o, the botani&s;t, and the fo&s;|&s;ili&s;t, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, might equally find Cornwall a country full of intere&s;ting objects. Here his &s;earch would be rewarded by a great variety of metals, fo&s;&s;ils, &s;tones, pebbles, and earths.</P>
<P>Here too the hi&s;torian might trace the va|rious &s;cenes of Druid rites, and of Roman and Dani&s;h power. Here al&s;o he might inve&s;ti|gate &s;ome of the capital actions of the civil wars of the la&s;t century; and follow the foot|&s;teps of Fairfax, Sir Beville Grenville, Lord Hopton, and other great commanders in the we&s;t. The battle of Stratton, in which the la&s;t of tho&s;e generals commanded, was an action ma&s;terly enough to have added laurels to Cae&s;ar, or the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Indeed we could have wi&s;hed to have gone a few miles farther to the north of this country, to have inve&s;tigated the &s;cene of this action. Lord Clarendon has de&s;cribed it &s;o accurately, that it can hardly be mi&s;taken. It was a hill, &s;teep on all &s;ides, bordering, if I under&s;tand him rightly,
<PB N="194" REF="218">
on a &s;andy common. On the top were en|camped a body of 5400 of the parliament forces, with thirteen pieces of cannon, under the Earl of Stamford. At five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of May 1642, the roy|ali&s;ts attacked them with very inferior force, in four divi&s;ions, who mounted four different parts of the hill at once. After a well-fought day, they all met about three in the afternoon at the top, and congratulated each other on having cleared the hill of the enemy, and taken their camp, baggage, ammunition, and cannon. The &s;cene of &s;o notable an exploit may be &s;till per|haps pointed out by the inhabitants of the country. From Lord Clarendon's de&s;cription, however, it may certainly be found.</P>
<P>It is probable al&s;o that, in a picture&s;que light, many of the ca&s;tles of this county might have de&s;erved attention; many of the coa&s;ts might have amu&s;ed us with elegant &s;weeping lines, and many of the bays might have been nobly hung with rockey &s;cenery. We &s;hould have wi&s;hed al&s;o to have heard the winds howl among the bleak promontories of the Land's-end; to have &s;een, through a clear evening, the light fall indi&s;tinctly on the di&s;tant i&s;les of Scilly; and to have viewed the waves beating
<PB N="195" REF="219">
round the rocks of that &s;ingular &s;ituation, Mount St. Michael. The lo&s;s of this la&s;t &s;cene we regretted more than any thing el&s;e. But to travel over de&s;arts of drearine&s;s in que&s;t of two or three objects &s;eemed to be buying them at too high a price; e&s;pecially as it is po&s;&s;ible they might have di&s;appointed us in the end. Many a time has the credulous traveller gone in que&s;t of &s;cenes on the information of others, and has found (&s;uch is the difference of opinions) that what gave his informant plea&s;ure, has given him di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<P>IN returning from Bodmin, we pa&s;&s;ed over that part of Bradoc-downs, where Lord Hopton's prowe&s;s was again &s;hewn in giving a con&s;iderable check to the parliament's forces in tho&s;e parts. This wild heath, and much of the neighbouring country, is in the &s;ame &s;tyle of dreary land&s;cape, with that we had found between Launce&s;ton and Bodmin. So very undi&s;ciplined the country &s;till is, that the wild &s;tags of nature, in many parts, claim it as their own. We did not &s;ee any of them; but we were told, they &s;ometimes &s;hew them&s;elves on the high moors about Bodmin and Le&s;card.</P>
<P>And yet the&s;e are the lands, wild as they are, that are the riche&s;t of the country. They bear little corn, it is true; but it is very im|material what the &s;urface produces: the har|ve&s;t lies beneath. In this neighbourhood &s;ome of the riche&s;t of the Corni&s;h mines are found; and Le&s;card, where we now were, is one of the Coinage-towns, as they are called. Of the&s;e towns there are five, which are &s;cattered
<PB N="197" REF="221">
about the different parts of Cornwall, where mines are mo&s;t frequent. After the tin is pounded, and wa&s;hed from the impurities of the mine, it is melted, &s;eparated from its dro&s;s, and run into large &s;quare blocks, con|taining each about three hundred pounds weight. In this form it is conveyed to the Coinage-town, where it is a&s;&s;ayed and &s;tamped. This &s;tamp makes it a &s;aleable commodity.</P>
<P>We had not, however, the curio&s;ity to enter any of the&s;e mines. Our bu&s;ine&s;s was only on the &s;urface. Great part of this country, it is true, is in a &s;tate of nature, which in general is a &s;tate of picture&s;que beauty; but here it was otherwi&s;e. Our views not only wanted the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary appendages of land&s;cape, wood, and water, but even <HI>form.</HI> We might, perhaps, have &s;een this part of Cornwall in an unfa|vourable light; as the &s;weeping lines of a country depend much for their beauty on the light under which they are &s;een; but to us they appeared heavy, unbroken, and unaccom|modating. In the wild parts of Scotland, where this drearine&s;s of land&s;cape often oc|curred, we had &s;till a di&s;tance to make amends for the fore-grounds. It was rarely that we had not a flowing line of blue mountains,
<PB N="198" REF="222">
which gave a grandeur and dignity even to an impoveri&s;hed &s;cene. But in the&s;e wild parts of Cornwall we &s;ometimes &s;aw a face of coun|try, (which is rather uncommon in the wilde&s;t &s;cenes of nature,) without a &s;ingle beauty to re|commend it.</P>
<P>This drearine&s;s, however, had begun to im|prove before we arrived at Le&s;card. Planta|tions, though meagre only, aro&s;e in various parts; and the country a&s;&s;umed &s;omewhat of a more plea&s;ing air; particularly on the right towards Le&s;twithiel. The high grounds formed inter&s;ections; &s;omething like a ca&s;tle appeared on one of them, and the woody decorations of land&s;cape in &s;ome degree took place.</P>
<P>As we left Le&s;card, the country &s;till im|proved. Exten&s;ive &s;ides of hills, covered with wood, aro&s;e among the fore-grounds, and rang|ing in noble &s;weeps, retired into di&s;tance. The&s;e bur&s;ts of &s;ylvan &s;cenery appeared with particular beauty at a place called Brown's-woods. Here too we were entertained with an <HI>incidental beauty.</HI> The whole &s;ky in front was hung with dark clouds to the very &s;kirts of the horizon. Behind us &s;hone the brighte&s;t
<PB N="199" REF="223">
ray of an evening &s;un, not yet indeed &s;etting, but very &s;plendid: and all this &s;plendor was received by the tops of trees, which ro&s;e di|rectly in front, and being oppo&s;ed to the gloomy tint behind them, made a mo&s;t bril|liant appearance. This is among the mo&s;t beautiful effects of an evening-&s;un. The&s;e effects are indeed as various as the forms of land&s;cape which receive them; but nothing is more <HI>richly</HI> enlightened than the tufted foliage of a wood.</P>
<P>We now approached the &s;ea, at lea&s;t the river Tamer, which is near its e&s;tuary; and as this coa&s;t is perhaps one of the mo&s;t broken and irregular of the whole i&s;land, we had &s;e|veral views of little creaks and bays, which being &s;urrounded with wood, are often beau|tiful. But they are beautiful at full-&s;ea only; at the ebb of the tide, each lake becomes an oozy channel.</P>
<P>The picture&s;que beauty of a &s;cene of this kind once co&s;t a poor traveller dear. He had long been in que&s;t of a &s;ituation for a hou&s;e, and found one at length offered to &s;ale, ex|actly &s;uited to his ta&s;te. It was a lake &s;cene;
<PB N="200" REF="224">
in which a little penin&s;ula, &s;loping gently into the water, pre&s;ented from its eminence a plea&s;|ing view of the whole. Charmed with what he had &s;een, he ruminated in his way home on the various improvements it might admit; and fearing a di&s;appointment, entered, without farther &s;crutiny, into an agreement with the owner, for a con&s;iderable &s;um. But what was his a&s;toni&s;hment, when, on taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, his lake was gone, and in its room, a bed of filthy ooze! How did he accu&s;e his ra&s;hne&s;s, and blame his precipitate folly! In vain he wi&s;hed to retract his bargain. In vain he pleaded, that he had been deceived; that he had bought a lake; and that, in fact, the ob|ject of his purcha&s;e was gone. <Q>You might have examined it better,</Q> cried the unfeeling gentlemen of the law: <Q>What have we to do with your ideas of picture&s;que beauty? We &s;old you an e&s;tate, and if you impo&s;ed upon your&s;elf, you have nobody el&s;e to blame.</Q></P>
<P>From the road, as we pa&s;&s;ed, we had a view of Trematon-ca&s;tle, where a &s;tannery court is &s;till kept, which had formerly very exten&s;ive
<PB REF="225">

privileges. <HI>Trematon-law</HI> is almo&s;t to this day an object of reverence among the common people of Cornwall.</P>
<P>Soon after, Salta&s;h-bay opened on the left, and on the right, Hamoaz harbour, with many a gallant &s;hip of war at anchor upon its ample bo&s;om. Beyond the Hamoaz ro&s;e the hang|ing lawns and woods of Mount Edgcomb, forming a noble back-ground to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>At Salta&s;h we had good views of the river Tamer, both above and below the town. A &s;weeping bay is formed on each &s;ide, in many places at lea&s;t a mile in breadth. In both di|rections the banks are high, and the water re|tires beautifully behind jutting promontories.</P>
<P>Having cro&s;&s;ed the Tamer at Salta&s;h, we had four miles farther to Plymouth. Through the whole way we had various views of the the &s;ound, Mount Edgcomb, Plymouth har|bour, Hamoaz, Plymouth town, and Plymouth dock. From all the&s;e views together we were able to collect a clear geographical idea of this celebrated harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="227">Two rivers, the Tamer and the Plym, (the fir&s;t of which is con&s;iderable,) meeting the &s;ea at the di&s;tance of about three miles a&s;under, form at their &s;eparate mouths two indented bays. The&s;e two bays open into a third, which is the receptacle of both, and larger than either. The bay formed by the Tamer, is called the <HI>Hamoaz;</HI> that formed by the Plym is called <HI>Plymouth Harbour;</HI> and the large bay, into which they both open, is called the <HI>Sound.</HI> At the bottom of the Sound, where the two bays communicate with it, lies St. Nicolas, a large i&s;land, fortified with a ca&s;tle and &s;trong works; which are intended to defend the en|trance into both the&s;e inlets. The entrance into Hamoaz is very intricate; for the i&s;land can be pa&s;&s;ed only at that end next Plymouth; which makes the pa&s;&s;age narrow and winding. The entrance at the other end is wide and direct; but is defended by a dangerous &s;helf of hidden rocks; the &s;ituation of which ap|pears plainly at low-water from the ripling of the tide above them. The Corni&s;h &s;ide of Ha|moaz is formed by Mount Edgcomb.</P>

<P>PLymouth-dock, or Dock-town, as it is often called, lies at the entrance of Ha|moaz, and is about two miles di&s;tant from the town of Plymouth. It is chiefly worth vi&s;it|ing, as it is the &s;tation of the docks, &s;torehou&s;es, gun-wharfs, and other appendages of this noble ar&s;enal; which is a wonderful &s;ight to tho&s;e who have &s;een nothing of the kind. The ci|tadel too, and the victualling-office, which is clo&s;e to it; the bake-hou&s;e al&s;o, and the &s;laugh|ter-hou&s;e, (whatever unplea&s;ant ideas may ac|company the latter,) are all grand objects of their kind.</P>
<P>Among the things which attracted our at|tention at Plymouth-dock were the marble quarries. We &s;aw &s;everal of the blocks po|li&s;hed; and thought them more beautiful than any foreign marble. The ground is dark brown, the veining red and blue. The colours are &s;oft in them&s;elves, and intermix agreeably;
<PB N="204" REF="229">
whereas in the Sienna, and other foreign marbles, there is often, amid&s;t all the richne&s;s of their colours, a glare and har&s;hne&s;s in their mixtures, di&s;agreeable to the picture&s;que eye, which always wi&s;hes to unite harmony with colouring. In the verde antique the tints are &s;ufficiently &s;oft; but they are &s;o much the &s;ame, and broken into &s;uch minute parts, that they have no effect, when exhibited in quantity. After all, however, different kinds of marble are &s;uited to different purpo&s;es. But I think there are two rules which &s;hould direct the choice of all marbles. In columns, and other large &s;urfaces, the parts &s;hould be large; that is, the veins of the marble &s;hould be con&s;picuous. I think al&s;o that no marble, in any &s;ituation, can be beautiful, unle&s;s there be a degree of &s;oft|ne&s;s and harmony in it: if it be veined, for in|&s;tance, the veins &s;hould, in &s;ome parts, &s;trike out boldly, and in other parts &s;ink and retire, as it were, into the ground of the marble, leaving only &s;light traces of their colours here and there behind them. In both the&s;e re&s;pects I have thought the columns in the hall at Kid|del&s;ton in Derby&s;hire models of beauty. It will, however, be under&s;tood, that when <HI>form</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="230">
or <HI>in&s;cription</HI> is required, veined marble of any kind is improper. In &s;ome works, as in mo&s;t kinds of ornaments, the marble it&s;elf is the principal object: in others, as in &s;tatuary and in&s;cription, the marble is only the vehicle.</P>
<P>With the Plymouth marble, in its rough &s;tate, mo&s;t of the buildings of the dock are con&s;tructed. The refu&s;e burns into excellent lime. Between Launce&s;ton and Kellington, I have heard there is a &s;pecies of marble found almo&s;t purely white; but as I never heard of its being applied to any u&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e it is only of a &s;purious kind.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another &s;pecies of beautiful &s;tone much in u&s;e at Plymouth, which is of Corni&s;h extraction, and is found chiefly on the moors, from whence it is called the <HI>Moor-&s;tone.</HI> The be&s;t kind of it is a perfect granite, and will bear a poli&s;h; though the &s;pars &s;ome|times fly off in the operation, and leave an un|equal &s;urface. The more friable kind of this &s;tone &s;pangles the road with an excellent bind|ing gravel.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ights of a dock-yard, the ca|reening of a &s;hip is not the lea&s;t picture&s;que. We happened to &s;ee an operation of this kind
<PB N="206" REF="231">
in great perfection. The &s;hip it&s;elf, lying on one &s;ide, is a good object. Its great lines, which in an upright &s;tate are too regular, take now more plea&s;ing forms; and while the roll|ing volumes of &s;moke harmonize the whole, the fire glimmering, &s;parkling, or blazing, is &s;ome|times enveloped in the&s;e black voluminous eddies, and &s;ometimes brightening up, breaks through them in tran&s;ient &s;piry blazes.</P>
<P>But as <HI>light</HI> is be&s;t &s;upported by <HI>&s;hade,</HI> a conflagration by <HI>night,</HI> from whatever cau&s;e produced, has the grande&s;t effect. By day the effect depends chiefly on the &s;moke, aided per|haps by &s;ome accidental objects; as it was here by the pitchy &s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el. But at night, the darkne&s;s of the hemi&s;phere makes the grande&s;t oppo&s;ition. The light is concen|trated to one &s;pot, only variou&s;ly broken, as it may happen to fall on different objects. At the &s;ame time it receives the full beauty of gradation. The ruddy glow which &s;preads far and wide into the regions of night, gra|duates, as it recedes from its centre, and be|coming fainter and fainter, is at la&s;t totally lo&s;t in the &s;hades of darkne&s;s. A conflagration, therefore, by night pre&s;ents us with the ju&s;te&s;t
<PB N="207" REF="232">
ideas of the great principles of light and &s;hade. It gives a <HI>body of light variou&s;ly broken;</HI> and at length dying <HI>gradually away.</HI></P>
<P>A common bonfire, &s;urrounded by a few figures &s;cattered about it in groups, forms often a beautiful &s;cene. That pa&s;&s;age, in which Shake&s;peare de&s;cribes the camp-fires of the French and Engli&s;h, gives us a different pic|ture. In that de&s;cription the fires are <HI>di&s;tant;</HI> and the <HI>paly flames</HI> ju&s;t <HI>umber</HI> the faces that watch round them. Touched with the pencil, they &s;hould be marked only as ruddy &s;pecks: all di&s;tinction of feature is lo&s;t. But round a <HI>bonfire on the &s;pot</HI> you &s;ee action and pa&s;&s;ion di&s;tinctly repre&s;ented; the hat waved, the agi|tated body, and the lips of the bawling mouth, all marked with the &s;tronge&s;t effects of light; while &s;ome of the figures, which &s;tand be|tween the eye and the fire, are as picture&s;quely di&s;tingui&s;hed by being totally in &s;hade.</P>
<P>Grand indeed, though dreadful, is the con|flagration of hou&s;es; e&s;pecially if tho&s;e hou&s;es have any dignity of form. The bur&s;ts of fire from windows and doors, the illumination of the internal parts of a &s;tructure, and the va|ried force of the fire on the different materials it meets with, which may be more or le&s;s com|bu&s;tible,
<PB N="208" REF="233">
are all circum&s;tances highly pictu|re&s;que. It may be added al&s;o, that wind makes a great difference in the appearance of a conflagration; and yet I know not whether its mo&s;t &s;plendid effects are not &s;een be&s;t in a calm.</P>
<P>But the operations of war produce &s;till grander effects of this kind. The burning of &s;hips is productive of greater ideas, and more picture&s;que circum&s;tances, than the burning of hou&s;es. The very reflections from the water add great beauty. But the&s;e repre&s;entations are among the difficult attempts of the pencil. Vanderveld, who did every thing well, and burnt many a &s;hip in a truly picture&s;que man|ner, failed mo&s;t in his grande&s;t work, the burn|ing of the Armada. <HI>Some parts</HI> of his pic|tures on this &s;ubject at Hampton Court are ma&s;terly; but in <HI>general</HI> they are but an indif|ferent collection of Vanderveld's works. Pro|bably the &s;ubject was <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> on him; and when that is the ca&s;e, the painter &s;eldom arrives at the excellence which <HI>his own &s;ubjects</HI> pro|duce. It cannot well indeed be otherwi&s;e; for the <HI>choice of a &s;ubject</HI> is, in other words, <HI>that ju&s;t arrangement</HI> of it, which he conceives ia his own mind, both in regard to compo|&s;ition
<PB N="209" REF="234">
and light. So that when a &s;ubject is <HI>impo&s;ed,</HI> the arrangement is to <HI>&s;eek;</HI> and it is probable, he may not ea&s;ily find one that &s;uits his &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, he &s;ets to it without that enthu&s;ia&s;m which &s;hould animate his pencil. When the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, therefore, em|ployed Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, &s;he did well in leaving him to choo&s;e his own &s;ubject. One thing, indeed, which injures Vanderveld in burning the Armada picture&s;quely, is the num|ber of fires he is obliged to introduce, which can never have &s;o good an effect as one.</P>
<P>But among all the grand exhibitions of this kind, the &s;iege of Gibraltar furni&s;hes two of the noble&s;t. They had every circum&s;tance to recommend them. They were grand in their own nature; they were connected with great and pro&s;perous events, which is a recommend|ation of any &s;ubject; and they were actions performed in the night. The fir&s;t relates to the burning of the enemy's batteries by a &s;ally from the garri&s;on; the &s;econd, to the de&s;truc|tion of the battering &s;hips. I &s;hall give them both in the words of a publi&s;hed Journal of that &s;iege, in which the effects are well de|&s;cribed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Drinkwater's Account of the Siege of Gibraltar, p. 201.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="235"><Q>Nov. 27, 1781. The batteries were &s;oon in a &s;tate for the fire-faggots to operate, and the flames &s;pread with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity into every part.

Homer, however, has nothing to do with mo&s;t of the&s;e picture&s;que images. They are only to be found in Pope's tran&s;lation. Though it may be fa&s;hionable to depreciate this work, as a tran&s;lation, it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be owned, that Pope, who was a painter, has enriched his ori|ginal with many of the ideas of his art.</P>
<P>But &s;till, in all the&s;e operations, however grand, the fire ravages only the <HI>works of man.</HI> To &s;ee a conflagration in perfection, we mu&s;t &s;ee the <HI>elements engaged.</HI> Nothing is <HI>eminently grand,</HI> but the exertion of an <HI>element.</HI> The effect of the <HI>air</HI> is grand, when excited by a &s;torm.

<PB N="212" REF="237">
grand. The <HI>ocean</HI> in a &s;torm is &s;till grander: and the effect of <HI>fire,</HI> when let loo&s;e in its full fury, carries the idea of grandeur to a &s;till greater height.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effects of this kind, which is any where to be met with, may be found in the 70th volume of the Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions, in a letter from Sir William Hamilton. It contains the account of an erup|tion of Mount Ve&s;uvius, in the autumn of the year 1779. The whole relation is full of grand ideas; but the parts of it, to which I particu|larly allude, were the <HI>concluding efforts</HI> of the eruption; from which I &s;hall &s;elect a few cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The relater, who was an eye-witne&s;s, tells us, that on Saturday the 7th of Augu&s;t, as he was watching the agitations of the mountain from the mole of Naples, which gave him a di&s;tinct view of it, a violent &s;torm came on, ju&s;t as the volcano was throwing out &s;ome of its fierce&s;t fires. The clouds of black &s;moke &s;ometimes covered great part of the fire; at other times di&s;parting, pre&s;ented it in fuller view. This awful conjunction of light and &s;hadow, was farther a&s;&s;i&s;ted by various tints, which were produced by lights reverberated
<PB N="213" REF="238">
from the clouds, and by pale fla&s;hes of light|ning, which were continually i&s;&s;uing from them.</P>
<P>But the appearance of the volcano, the next day, was &s;till more &s;ublime. About nine o'clock in the morning, a loud report i&s;&s;ued from the mountain, which &s;hook the hou&s;es of Por|tici to &s;uch a degree, as to alarm the inhabit|ants for their &s;afety, and drive them into the &s;treets. Immediately volumes of liquid fire, or rather, as the relater de&s;cribes it, fountains of red-hot lava, &s;hot upwards to &s;uch an amaz|ing height, that they &s;eemed three times as high as the mountain it&s;elf, which is computed to ri&s;e three thou&s;and feet from the level of the &s;ea. Together with the&s;e volumes of liquid fire, va&s;t clouds of the blacke&s;t &s;moke &s;ucceeded each other in bur&s;ts, intercepting this &s;plendid brightne&s;s here and there by ma&s;&s;es of the darke&s;t hue.</P>
<P>The wind was &s;outh-we&s;t; and though gen|tle, was &s;ufficient to put the &s;moke into mo|tion, removing it by degrees &s;o as to form be|hind the fire a va&s;t curtain, &s;tretching over great part of the hemi&s;phere. To add to the &s;olemnity, this black curtain was continually di&s;parted by pale, momentary, electric fires.
<PB N="214" REF="239">
In the mean time, the other parts of the &s;ky were clear, and the &s;tars &s;hone bright. The contra&s;t was glorious beyond imagination. The &s;plendor, which was &s;ufficiently balanced by the &s;hadowy curtain behind it, illumined the &s;ea, which was perfectly calm, far and wide, and added much to the &s;ublimity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Some of the fiery lava being thrown on mount Somna, in the neighbourhood of Ve|&s;uvius, its woods were frequently in a blaze. This introduced a &s;econdary light, very differ|ent in its tint, either from the fiery red of the volcano, or the &s;ilvery blue of the electric fire.</P>
<P>This grand and awful vi&s;ion, in which as &s;ub|lime <HI>an effect of light and &s;hade</HI> was pre&s;ented, as Nature perhaps ever exhibited before, la&s;ted about half an hour.</P>
<P>I make no apology for introducing all the&s;e grand effects of fire, as I never think my&s;elf out of &s;ight of my &s;ubject, when I can lay hold of any picture&s;que idea.</P>

<P>OUR curio&s;ity having been gratified among the dock-yards at Plymouth, led us next to vi&s;it Mount Edgcomb.</P>
<P>The promontory of Mount Edgcomb run|ning a con&s;iderable way into the &s;ea, forms, as was ju&s;t ob&s;erved, one of the cheeks of the en|trance of Hamoaz-harbour, which is here half a mile acro&s;s. The whole promontory is four or five miles long, and three broad. In &s;hape it is a perfect <HI>dor&s;um,</HI> high in the middle, and &s;loping gradually on both &s;ides towards the &s;ea; in &s;ome places it is rocky and abrupt.</P>
<P>Lord Edgcomb's hou&s;e &s;tands half way up the a&s;cent, on the Plymouth &s;ide, in the mid&s;t of a park, containing an intermixture of wood and lawn. It makes a hand&s;ome appearance with a tower at each corner; but pretends only to be a comfortable dwelling.</P>
<P>The great object of Mount Edgcomb is the grandeur of the views. As we advanced towards the &s;ummit of the promontory, we &s;aw, in various exhibitions, on one &s;ide, all the
<PB N="216" REF="241">
intricacies and creeks, which form the harbour of Plymouth; with an exten&s;ive country &s;preading beyond it into very remote di&s;tance; and &s;cattered with a variety of objects; among which we di&s;tingui&s;hed the well-known fea|tures of Brentor.</P>
<P>The other &s;ide of the promontory overlooks the Sound, which is the great rendezvous of the fleets &s;itted out at Plymouth; though &s;ea|men &s;peak very indifferently of its anchorage. One of the boundaries of this exten&s;ive bay is a reach of land running out into pointed rocks; the other is a lofty &s;mooth promontory, called the Ram's-head. The top of this promontory is adorned with a tower, from which notice is given at Plymouth, by a variety of &s;ignals, of the number of &s;hips, and their quality, that appear in the offing.</P>
<P>Between the Ram's-head and Mount Edg|comb is formed a &s;maller inlet, called Cau&s;and-bay, at the head of which lies King&s;ton. Be|fore this little town rode a large fleet of what appeared to be fi&s;hing boats; but we were in|formed that mo&s;t of them were &s;muggling ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of the few objects which form the Sound on one &s;ide, made a plea&s;ing
<PB N="217" REF="242">
contra&s;t with the intricacies of the Plymouth-coa&s;t on the other.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about three leagues from the Ram's-head, &s;tands the Edy&s;tone light-hou&s;e. We could ju&s;t di&s;cern it, as it caught a gleam of light, like a di&s;tant &s;ail.</P>
<P>Having viewed from the higher grounds of Mount Edgcomb this immen&s;e land&s;cape, which is, on both &s;ides, a mere map of the country, and has little <HI>picture&s;que beauty,</HI> e&s;pe|cially on the Plymouth &s;ide, we de&s;cended the promontory, and were carried on a lower &s;tage round its utmo&s;t limits.</P>
<P>The grounds here are profu&s;ely planted. On that &s;ide which overlooks Cau&s;and-bay, the plantations are only young; but on the other, which con&s;i&s;ts of at lea&s;t half the promontory, they are well-grown, and form the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing &s;cenes about Mount Edgcomb. That im|men&s;e map, as it lay before the eye <HI>in one view</HI> from the higher grounds, and appeared vari|ou&s;ly broken and &s;cattered, was now divided into portions, and &s;et off by good foregrounds. Some of the&s;e views are plea&s;ing; but in ge|neral they are not picture&s;que. A large piece of water full of moving objects, makes a part
<PB N="218" REF="243">
of them all; and this will always pre&s;ent at lea&s;t an amu&s;ing &s;cene.</P>
<P>The trees, both evergreens and deciduous, are wonderfully fine, con&s;idering their &s;ea-a&s;|pect. But chiefly the pine-race &s;eems to thrive; and among the&s;e the pina&s;ter, which, one &s;hould imagine, from its hardy appearance, to be indigenous to the &s;oil. The woodman would di&s;like that great abundance of hoary mo&s;s, which bedecks both it and mo&s;t of the other plants of this marine &s;cenery; but to the picture&s;que eye, the vegetation &s;eems perfect; and the mo&s;s a beauty. It is mo&s;s of a pecu|liar form, at lea&s;t of an unu&s;ual growth. Its hue is generally cerulean, with a &s;trong touch here and there of Naples-yellow, mixed with other plea&s;ing tints, which being &s;cattered pro|fu&s;ely about the whole plantation, give it an uncommon richne&s;s. In the&s;e woods the ar|butus grows in great perfection, and many other &s;hrubs, which are generally found only in &s;heltered &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a luxuriance of wood, a variety of rocky &s;cenery embelli&s;hed our walk, e&s;pecially about the vertical point of the promontory. It is a well-coloured brown rock; which appears
<PB N="219" REF="244">
in all forms. Nor is it bald and naked, but every where garni&s;hed with twirling boles and hanging &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, though there are many formalities about Mount Edgcomb, terraces particularly, and vi&s;tas near the hou&s;e, a few puerilities al&s;o <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will recollect when this was written.</NOTE>, and too little advantage taken every where of the circum&s;tances which na|ture has pointed out; yet it is certainly a noble &s;ituation, and very well worth the attention of a traveller.</P>

<P>AMONG the curio&s;ities of this coa&s;t, the Edy&s;tone light-hou&s;e is not one of the lea&s;t. About three leagues beyond Plymouth-&s;ound, in a line nearly between &s;tart-point and the Lizard, lie a number of low rocks, exceed|ingly dangerous at all times, but e&s;pecially when the tides are high, which render them in|vi&s;ible. On the&s;e rocks it had long been thought nece&s;&s;ary to place &s;ome monitory &s;ignal. But the difficulty of con&s;tructing a light-hou&s;e was great. One of the rocks indeed, which com|po&s;e this reef, is con&s;iderably larger than the re&s;t: yet its dimen&s;ions are &s;till narrow; it is often covered with water, and frequently, even in the calme&s;t weather, &s;urrounded by a &s;well|ing &s;ea, which makes it difficult to land upon it; and much more &s;o to carry on any work of time and labour. The uncommon tumult of the &s;ea in this place is occa&s;ioned by a pecu|liarity in the rocks. As they all &s;lope and point to the north-ea&s;t, they &s;pread their inclined &s;ides, of cour&s;e, to the &s;welling tides and &s;torms
<PB N="221" REF="246">
of the Atlantic. And as they continue in this &s;helving direction many fathoms below the &s;ur|face of the &s;ea, they occa&s;ion that violent work|ing of the water, which the &s;eamen call a <HI>ground &s;well.</HI> So that after a &s;torm, when the &s;urface of the &s;ea around is perfectly &s;mooth, the &s;wells and agitation about the&s;e rocks are dangerous. From the&s;e continual eddies the Edy&s;tone de|rives its name.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t light-hou&s;e of any con&s;equence, erected on this rock, was undertaken by a per|&s;on of the name of Win&s;tanley, in the reign of King William. Mr. Win&s;tanley does not ap|pear to have been a man of &s;olidity and judg|ment &s;ufficient to erect an edifice of this kind. He had never been noted for any capital work; but much celebrated for a variety of trifling and ridiculous contrivances. If you &s;et your foot on a certain board in one of his rooms, a gho&s;t would &s;tart up; or if you &s;at down in an elbow-chair, its arms would cla&s;p around you. His light-hou&s;e, which was built of wood, par|took of his whim&s;ical genius. It was fini&s;hed with galleries, and other ornaments, which en|cumbered it, without being of any u&s;e. It was, however, on the whole, much admired as a very ingenious edifice, and Win&s;tanley cer|tainly
<PB N="222" REF="247">
de&s;erved the credit of being the fir&s;t pro|jector of a very difficult work. He had fixed it to the rock by twelve ma&s;&s;y bars of iron, which were let down deep into the body of the &s;tone. It was generally indeed thought well founded; and the architect him&s;elf was &s;o con|vinced of its &s;tability, that he would often &s;ay, he wi&s;hed for nothing more than to be &s;hut up in it during a violent &s;torm. He at length had his wi&s;h; for he happened to be in it, at the time of that memorable &s;torm on the 26th of November 1703, which hath been already mentioned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 156 and 168.</NOTE>. As the violence, however, of the tempe&s;t came on, the terrified architect began to doubt the firmne&s;s of his work: it trembled in the bla&s;t, and &s;hook in every joint. In vain he made what &s;ignals of distre&s;s he could in|vent, to bring a boat from the &s;hore. The ter|rors of the &s;torm were &s;uch, that the bolde&s;t ve&s;&s;el dur&s;t not face it. How long he conti|nued in this melancholy di&s;tre&s;s is unknown; but in the morning no appearance of the light-hou&s;e was left. It and all its contents, during that terrible night, were &s;wept into the &s;ea. This cata&s;trophe furni&s;hed Mr. Gay with the
<PB N="223" REF="248">
following &s;imile in his Trivia, which was writ|ten a few years after the event: <Q><L>So when fam'd Edy&s;ton's far-&s;hooting ray,</L>
<L>That led the &s;ailor through the &s;tormy way,</L>
<L>Was from its rocky roots by billows torn,</L>
<L>And the high turret in the whirlwind born,</L>
<L>Fleets bulged their &s;ides again&s;t the craggy land,</L>
<L>And pitchy ruins blacken'd all the &s;trand.</L></Q></P>
<P>A light-hou&s;e was again con&s;tructed on this rock before the conclu&s;ion of Queen Anne's reign. It was undertaken by one Rudyard, who built it al&s;o of wood, but having &s;een his predece&s;&s;or's errors, avoided them. He followed Win&s;tanley's idea in the mode of fix|ing his &s;tructure to the rock; but he cho&s;e a plain circular form, without any gallery, or u&s;ele&s;s projecting parts for the &s;torm to fa&s;ten on. To give &s;tability al&s;o to his work, he ju|diciou&s;ly introduced, as balla&s;t at the bottom, 270 tons of &s;tone. In &s;hort, every precaution was taken to &s;ecure it again&s;t the fury of the two elements of wind and water, which had de|&s;troyed the la&s;t. But it fell by a third. Late one night, in the year 1755, it was ob&s;erved from the &s;hore to be on fire. Its upper works having been con&s;tructed of light timber, pro|bably could not bear the heat. It happened fortunately that Admiral We&s;t rode with a

fleet at that time in the Sound; and being &s;o near the &s;pot, he immediately manned two or three &s;wift boats. Other boats put off from the &s;hore; but though it was not &s;tormy, it was impo&s;&s;ible to land. In the mean time the fire having de&s;cended to the lower parts of the building, had driven the poor inhabitants upon the &s;kirts of the rock; where they were &s;itting di&s;con&s;olate, when a&s;&s;i&s;tance arrived. They had the mortification, however, to find that the boats, through fear of being da&s;hed in pieces, were obliged to keep aloof. At length it was contrived to throw coils of rope upon the rock, which the men tied round them, and were dragged on board through the &s;ea. The ca&s;e of one of the&s;e poor fellows, who was above 90 years of age, was &s;ingular. As he had been endeavouring to extingui&s;h the fire in the cupola, where it fir&s;t raged, and was looking up, the melted lead from the roof came trickling down upon his face and &s;houlders. At Plymouth he was put into a &s;urgeon's hands; and, though much hurt, he appeared to be in no danger. He con&s;tantly, however, affirmed, that &s;ome of the melted lead had fallen down his throat. This was not believed, as it was thought he could not have &s;urvived &s;uch a
<PB N="225" REF="250">
circum&s;tance. In twelve days he died; and Mr. Smeaton &s;ays, he &s;aw the lead, after it had been taken out of his &s;tomach; and that it weighed &s;even ounces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Smeaton's Account of the Edy&s;tone.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The next light-hou&s;e, which is the pre&s;ent one, was built by Mr. Smeaton, and is con|&s;tructed on a plan, which it is hoped will &s;e|cure it again&s;t every danger. It is built entirely of &s;tone, in a circular form. Its foundations are let into a &s;ocket in the rock, on which it &s;tands, and of which it almo&s;t makes a part; for the &s;tones are all united with the rock, and with each other, by ma&s;&s;y dove-tails. The ce|ment u&s;ed in this curious ma&s;onry is the lime of Watchet <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 169.</NOTE>, from whence Mr. Smeaton con|trived to bring it barrelled up in cyder-ca&s;ks; for the proprietors will not &s;uffer it to be ex|ported in its crude &s;tate. The door of this in|genious piece of architecture is only the &s;ize of a &s;hip's gun-port; and the windows are mere loop-holes, denying light to exclude wind. When the tide &s;wells above the foundation of the building, the light hou&s;e makes the odd ap|pearance of a &s;tructure emerging from the waves. But &s;ometimes a wave ri&s;es above the
<PB N="226" REF="251">
very top of it, and circling round, the whole looks like a column of water, till it breaks into foam, and &s;ub&s;ides.</P>
<P>The care of this important beacon is com|mitted to four men; two of whom take the charge of it by turns, and are relieved every &s;ix weeks. But as it often happens, e&s;pecially in &s;tormy weather, that boats cannot touch at the Edy&s;tone for many months, a proper quan|tity of &s;alt provi&s;ion is always laid up, as in a &s;hip victualled for a long voyage. In high winds &s;uch a briny atmo&s;phere &s;urrounds this gloomy &s;olitude from the da&s;hing of the waves, that a man expo&s;ed to it could not draw his breath. At the&s;e dreadful intervals the two forlorn inhabitants keep clo&s;e quarters, and are obliged to live in darkne&s;s and &s;tench; li&s;ten|ing to the howling &s;torm, excluded in every emergency from the lea&s;t hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and without any earthly comfort, but what is admini&s;tered from their confidence in the &s;trength of the building in which they are im|mured. Once, on relieving this forlorn guard, one of the men was found dead, his compa|nion chu&s;ing rather to &s;hut him&s;elf up with a putrifying carca&s;e, than, by throwing it into the &s;ea, to incur the &s;u&s;picion of murder. In
<PB N="227" REF="252">
fine weather, the&s;e wretched beings ju&s;t &s;cram|ble a little about the edge of the rock, when the tide ebbs, and amu&s;e them&s;elves with fi&s;hing; which is the only employment they have, ex|cept that of trimming their nightly fires.</P>
<P>Such total inaction and entire &s;eclu&s;ion from all the joys and aids of &s;ociety, can only be endured by great religious philo&s;ophy, which we cannot imagine they feel; or by great &s;tu|pidity, which in pity we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet though this wretched community is &s;o &s;mall, we were a&s;&s;ured it is generally a &s;cene of mi&s;anthropy. In&s;tead of &s;uffering the recol|lection of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dangers in which each is de&s;erted by all but one, to endear that one to him, we were informed the humours of each were &s;o &s;oured, that they preyed both on them&s;elves, and on each other. If one &s;at above, the other was commonly found below. Their meals too were &s;olitary, each, like a brute, growling over his food alone.</P>
<P>We are &s;orry to acknowledge a picture like this to be a likene&s;s of human nature. In &s;ome gentle minds we &s;ee the kind affections <HI>rejoice</HI> in being beckoned even from &s;cenes of inno|cence,
<PB N="228" REF="253">
mirth, and gaiety, to mingle the &s;ympa|thetic tear with affliction and di&s;tre&s;s. But ex|perience &s;hews us, that the heart of man is equally &s;u&s;ceptible of the malevolent affections; and religion joins in confirming the melan|choly truth. The <HI>picture&s;que eye,</HI> in the mean|time, &s;urveys natural and moral evil, under characters entirely different. Darken the &s;torm; let loo&s;e the winds; let the waves overwhelm all that is fair and good; the &s;torm will be &s;ub|lime, and the cata&s;trophe pathetic; while the moral tempe&s;t is dreary, without grandeur, and the cata&s;trophe afflicting, without one pictu|re&s;que idea.</P>
<P>The emolument of this arduous po&s;t is twenty pounds a year, and provi&s;ions while on duty. The hou&s;e to live in may be fairly thrown into the bargain. The whole together is, perhaps, one of the lea&s;t eligible pieces of preferment in Britain: and yet from a &s;tory, which Mr. Smeaton relates, it appears there are &s;tations &s;till more ineligible. A fellow, who got a good livelihood by making leathern-pipes for engines, grew tired of &s;itting con&s;tantly at work, and &s;olicited a light-hou&s;e man's place, which, as competitors are not numerous, he
<PB N="229" REF="254">
obtained. As the Edy&s;tone-boat was carrying him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new habitation, one of the boatmen a&s;ked him, what could tempt him to give up a profitable bu&s;ine&s;s to be &s;hut up, for months together, in a pillar? "Why," &s;aid the man, <Q>becau&s;e I did not like con|finement.</Q></P>

<P>AT Plymouth we heard much of the &s;cenery upon the Tamer, of which we had had a little &s;pecimen at Axworthy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 189.</NOTE>. We re&s;olved therefore to navigate that river as far as the Weir, which is about twenty-two miles above Plymouth, and as far as we could have the ad|vantage of the tide. Procuring therefore a good boat, and four &s;tout hands from the Ocean man of war, then lying in the Hamoaz, we &s;et &s;ail with a flowing tide.</P>
<P>The river Tamer ri&s;es from the mountains of Hartland, near Barn&s;taple-bay, in the north of Devon&s;hire, and, taking its cour&s;e almo&s;t due &s;outh, divides that county from Cornwall. No river can be a more complete boundary. As it approaches Plymouth, it becomes a noble e&s;tuary. The Hamoaz is e&s;teemed, after Port&s;|mouth, the be&s;t &s;tation for &s;hips of war upon the Briti&s;h coa&s;t. This grand bay, which was the fir&s;t &s;cene we inve&s;tigated on the Tamer, is
<PB REF="256">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="231" REF="257">
about a mile in breadth, and &s;even miles in length; though the larger &s;hips we ob&s;erved &s;eldom to anchor above a league from the &s;ea. Its banks on each &s;ide, though rather low, are by no means flat. They are generally culti|vated; and the &s;hore is fini&s;hed by a narrow edging of rock.</P>
<P>The next view we had of any con&s;equence, was the opening towards St. German's on the left. This is a creek about three leagues in length. The woods of Anthony occupy one &s;ide of the opening; and a hou&s;e which appeared at a di&s;tance in the centre, is Ince, a &s;eat of the Killigrews.</P>
<P>Soon after, we came in &s;ight of Salta&s;h, which &s;tands high, but affords no very pic|ture&s;que appearance. When we cro&s;&s;ed the ferry the day before, the views of the creek from the hill pre&s;ented a beautiful &s;cene, both above and below the town <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 201.</NOTE>; but when the eye is &s;tationed <HI>upon</HI> the water, the retiring reaches of the river are lo&s;t, and the land&s;cape is much impaired.</P>
<P>Our next &s;cene was the opening of the Tavey into the Tamer. Sir Harry Trelaw|ney's
<PB N="232" REF="258">
hou&s;e was one of the principal objects of this view. The di&s;tance was compo&s;ed chiefly of the Dartmore hills. The banks of the Tamer were &s;till low, and cultivated; and bore no proportion to the extent of the water, which did not begin to contract it&s;elf, nor the banks to &s;well, till we had proceeded nine or ten miles up the river.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene, which in any degree en|gaged our attention, was compo&s;ed of the woods of Pentilly, on the Corni&s;h &s;ide. The hou&s;e too is a good object, and a building at the bottom of the bank has a picture&s;que ap|pearance; though its dignity was degraded when we learned it was only a lime-kiln. Lime is the chief commodity of trade on this river, employing many large boats in tran&s;porting it; and the lime-kilns, which we &s;ee in many places on its banks, are of &s;uch noble dimen|&s;ions, that they may, at a little di&s;tance, be mi&s;|taken for ca&s;tles, without any imputation on the under&s;tanding. They are among the greate&s;t ornaments of the river. The back|ground of the &s;cenery of Pentilly, is a lofty bank adorned with a tower, to which belongs a hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="259">Mr. Tilly, once the owner of Pentilly-hou&s;e, was a celebrated athei&s;t of the la&s;t age. He was a man of wit, and had by rote all the ri|baldry and common-place je&s;ts again&s;t religion and &s;cripture; which are well &s;uited to di&s;play pertne&s;s and folly, and to un&s;ettle a giddy mind, but are offen&s;ive to men of &s;en&s;e, what|ever their opinions may be, and are neither in|tended nor adapted to inve&s;tigate truth. The brilliancy of Mr. Tilly's wit, however, carried him a degree farther than we often meet with in the annals of prophanene&s;s. In general the witty athei&s;t is &s;atisfied with entertaining his <HI>contemporaries;</HI> but Mr. Tilly wi&s;hed to have his &s;prightline&s;s known to <HI>po&s;terity.</HI> With this view, in ridicule of the re&s;urrection, he obliged his executors to place his dead body, in his u&s;ual garb, and in his elbow-chair, upon the top of a hill, and to arrange, on a table be|fore him, bottles, gla&s;&s;es, pipes, and tobacco. In this &s;ituation he ordered him&s;elf to be im|mured in a tower of &s;uch dimen&s;ions, as he pre&s;cribed; where he propo&s;ed, he &s;aid, pati|ently to wait the event. All this was done, and the tower, &s;till inclo&s;ing its tenant, remains as a monument of his impiety and prophane|ne&s;s.

The country people &s;hudder as they go near it:
<Q><L>&mdash; Religio pavidos terrebat agre&s;tes</L>
<L>Dira loci:&mdash;&s;ylvam, &s;axumque tremebant.</L></Q></P>
<P>As we &s;ailed farther up the river, we came in view of the rocks and woods of Coteil, which are &s;till on the Corni&s;h &s;ide, and afford &s;ome beautiful &s;cenery. Here we had grand &s;weeping hills, covered with wood. At the bottom of one of them &s;tands a noble lime-kiln-ca&s;tle, which is relieved by a lofty back|ground.</P>
<P>Near the bottom of another &s;tands a &s;mall Gothic ruin, &s;ituated, with much picture&s;que beauty, in a woody rece&s;s. It was formerly a votive chapel, built by a chief of the Coteil fa|mily; though &s;ome &s;ay by one of the Edg|combs. Its founder had engaged on the un&s;uc|ce&s;sful &s;ide, during one of the periods of the dubious wars of York and Lanca&s;ter. His party being beaten, he fled for his life; and as he was a man of con&s;equence, was clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued. The Tamer oppo&s;ed his flight. He made a &s;hort vow to the Virgin Mary, threw him&s;elf into the river, and &s;wam &s;afe to the promontory, before which we now lay on our
<PB REF="261">

oars. His upper garment, which he had thrown off, floated down the &s;tream; and giving occa|&s;ion to believe he had peri&s;hed, checked the ardour of pur&s;uit. In the mean time Coteil lurked in his own woods, till a happier mo|ment; and in the day of &s;ecurity rai&s;ed this chapel to the holy Virgin, his protectre&s;s, who had the full honour of his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>We have the &s;tory &s;ometimes told other|wi&s;e, and given to the times of Charles I.; but a &s;tory of &s;o late a date, one &s;hould ima|gine, might have been better a&s;certained, than this &s;eems to be; and if the chapel have any connection with the &s;tory, it is much more credible, that a votive-chapel &s;hould have been erected in the 15th century, when we know they were common, than in the 17th, when &s;uch &s;tructures were never heard of.</P>
<P>At Coteil-hou&s;e we landed, which is entirely &s;urrounded with wood, and &s;hut out from the river. If it were a little opened, it might both &s;ee and be &s;een to advantage. To the river particularly it would pre&s;ent a good object; as it &s;tands on a bold knoll, and is built in the form of a ca&s;tle. But it is a de&s;erted man&s;ion, and occupied only as a farm-hou&s;e. Here we re|fre&s;hed our&s;elves with tea, and larded our bread,
<PB N="236" REF="263">
after the fa&s;hion of the country, with clouted cream.</P>
<P>Round this old man&s;ion grew &s;ome noble trees; and among them the Spani&s;h che&s;nut, full grown, and &s;pread out in huge ma&s;&s;y limbs. We thought the&s;e che&s;nuts &s;carce in|ferior in grandeur to the proude&s;t oaks. The che&s;nut, on which Salvator Ro&s;a has hung Edipus, is exactly one of them.</P>
<P>We had now &s;ailed a con&s;iderable way up the Tamer, and, during the whole voyage, had been almo&s;t &s;olely obliged to the Corni&s;h &s;hores for amu&s;ement. But the Devon&s;hire coa&s;t, as if only collecting its &s;trength, bur&s;t out upon us at Cal&s;tock, in a grander di&s;|play of lofty banks, adorned with wood and rock, than any we had yet &s;een, and continued without interruption through the &s;pace of a league.</P>
<P>But it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe &s;cenes, which, though <HI>&s;trongly marked,</HI> have no <HI>peculiar</HI> fea|tures. In Nature the&s;e lofty banks are infi|nitely varied. The face of each rock is differ|ent; it projects differently: it is naked, or it is adorned; or, if adorned, its ornaments are of different kinds. In &s;hort, Nature's variations are as infinite on the face of a rock, as in the
<PB N="237" REF="264">
face of a man. Each requires a di&s;tinct por|trait to characterize it ju&s;tly; while language can no more give you a full idea of one, than it can of the other.</P>
<P>With the views of Cal&s;tock we fini&s;hed our voyage up the Tamer; and though the banks of the river were diver&s;ified both with rocks and woods, with open and contracted country; yet, con&s;idering the &s;pace through which we had &s;ailed, and the high commendations we had heard of this river, it was, on the whole, le&s;s a &s;cene of amu&s;ement, than we had expected to find it. We had a few grand views; but in general the navigators of the Tamer find only &s;ome of the common characteri&s;tics of a river:
<Q><L>&mdash;Longos &s;uperant flexus, varii&s;que teguntur</L>
<L>Arboribus; viride&s;que &s;ecant placido aequore &s;ylvas.</L></Q>
All is beautiful, &s;ylvan, and highly plea&s;ing; but if you a&s;k what we &s;aw, we can only &s;ay <HI>in ge|neral,</HI> that we &s;aw rocks, trees, groves, and woods. In &s;hort, the whole is amu&s;ing, but not picture&s;que; it is not &s;ufficiently divided into portions adapted to the pencil.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery it&s;elf, on the banks of the Ta|mer, is certainly good; but had it even been better, the form of the river could not have
<PB N="238" REF="265">
&s;hewn it to much picture&s;que advantage. The reaches are commonly too long, and admit lit|tle winding. We rarely trace the cour&s;e of the river by the per&s;pective of one &s;kreen be|hind another; which in river views is often a beautiful circum&s;tance: and yet, if one of the banks be lofty, broken into large parts, and fall|ing away in good per&s;pective, the length of the reach may po&s;&s;ibly be an advantage. In &s;ome parts of the Tamer we had this grand lengthened view; but in other parts we wi&s;hed to have had its continued reaches more con|tracted.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks, however, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, affect a river only in <HI>navigating</HI> it. When we are thus on a <HI>level</HI> with its &s;urface, we have rarely more than a fore-ground; at mo&s;t we have only a fir&s;t di&s;tance. But when we take a higher &s;tand, and view a remote river, lofty banks become then an incumbrance; and in|&s;tead of di&s;covering, they hide its winding cour&s;e. When the di&s;tance becomes &s;till more remote, the valley through which the river winds &s;hould be open, and the country flat, to produce the mo&s;t plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>In the immen&s;e rivers that traver&s;e conti|nents, the&s;e ideas are all lo&s;t. As you &s;ail up
<PB N="239" REF="266">
&s;uch a va&s;t &s;urface of water, as the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, for in&s;tance, the fir&s;t &s;triking ob&s;ervation is, that per&s;pective views are entirely out of the que&s;tion. If you wi&s;h to examine either of its &s;hores, you mu&s;t de&s;ert the main channel; and, knowing that you are in a river, make to one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>As you approach within half a league of one of the &s;ides, you will perhaps &s;ee &s;tretches of &s;and-banks, or i&s;lands covered with wood, extending along the &s;hore, beyond the reach of the eye, which have been formed by de|predations made on the coa&s;t by the river; for when the winds rage, this va&s;t &s;urface of water is agitated like a &s;ea; and has the &s;ame power over its &s;hores. As the trees of the&s;e regions are in as grand a &s;tyle as the rivers them&s;elves, you &s;ometimes &s;ee va&s;t excavations, where the water has undermined the banks, in which im|men&s;e roots are laid bare, and, being wa&s;hed clean from the &s;oil, appear twi&s;ted into various forms, like the gates of a cathedral.</P>
<P>Though the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, we are told, are generally flat, you frequently &s;ee beau|tiful &s;cenery upon them. Among the va&s;t woods which adorn them, are many groves of cypre&s;&s;es; to which a creeping plant, called
<PB N="240" REF="267">
the Liane, is often attached. What kind of flower it bears, I have not heard; but if it be not too profu&s;e, it mu&s;t be very ornamental: hang|ing from tree to tree, and connecting a whole cypre&s;s-grove together with rich fe&s;toons.</P>
<P>The&s;e woods are inter&s;per&s;ed al&s;o with lawns, where you &s;ee the wild deer of the country feeding in herds. As they e&s;py the ve&s;&s;el glid|ing pa&s;t, they all rai&s;e their heads at once, and &s;tanding a moment, with pricked ears, in amazement, they turn &s;uddenly round, and darting acro&s;s the plain, hide them&s;elves in the woods.</P>
<P>From &s;cenes of this kind, as you coa&s;t the river, you come perhaps to low mar&s;hy grounds; where &s;wamps, overgrown with reeds and ru&s;hes, but of enormous growth, ex|tend through endle&s;s tracts, which a day's &s;ail|ing cannot leave behind. In the&s;e mar&s;hes the alligator is often &s;een ba&s;king near the edge of the river, into which he in&s;tantly plunges on the lea&s;t alarm; or perhaps you de&s;cry his hide|ous form creeping along the &s;edges, &s;ometimes hid, and &s;ometimes di&s;covered, as he moves through a clo&s;er, or more open path.</P>
<P>Contra&s;ts, like the&s;e, between the Tamer and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, are amu&s;ing, and &s;et each &s;cene
<PB N="241" REF="268">
off to more advantage. The Tamer may be called a noble river; but what is it in point of grandeur, when compared with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which, at the di&s;tance of two thou&s;and miles from the &s;ea, is a wider &s;tream than the Tamer, where it falls into it? On the other hand, though the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, no doubt, has its beauty; yet as a river, it lo&s;es as much in this re&s;pect, when compared with the Tamer, as it gained in point of grandeur. In the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi you &s;eek in vain for the rocky banks and winding &s;hores which adorn the Tamer, and are the glory of river-&s;cenery.</P>
<P>To the&s;e contra&s;ts I &s;hall ju&s;t add one more. As Lord Macartney and his &s;uit, in their way to Canton, &s;ailed down one of the rivers of China, they pa&s;&s;ed under a rock of grey mar|ble, which aro&s;e from the water to the amaz|ing perpendicular height of &s;ix hundred feet. It was &s;hagged with wood, and continued va|rying its form, but &s;till pre&s;erving its immen|&s;ity, through the &s;pace of at lea&s;t two miles. In &s;ome parts its &s;ummit beetled frightfully over the river, and gave an involuntary &s;hud|der to the pa&s;&s;enger, as he pa&s;&s;ed under its tre|mendous &s;hade.</P>

<P>AS we were leaving Plymouth, the town was greatly agitated with an account received that morning of the battle of Lexington, which happened on the 19th of April. We had been chiefly in company with General Bell of the marines; and as a large detachment from that corps was with the troops in America, the ge|neral's hou&s;e was crowded with people inquir|ing after their relations and friends; while they who looked farther, conceived, that as blood was now drawn, all hope of accommo|dation was over.</P>
<P>We left Plymouth under the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e melancholy ideas, till a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects di&s;lodged them. By the A&s;hburton road we took our route to Exeter.</P>
<P>About three miles from Plymouth &s;tands Salterham, the &s;eat of Mr. Parker. It is Mount Edgcomb in miniature; being &s;ituated on a
<PB N="243" REF="270">
&s;mall penin&s;ula, and &s;urrounded, not indeed by the &s;ea, but by a con&s;iderable creek.</P>
<P>Mr. Parker commands a view of St. Ni|cholas's i&s;land, Mount Edgcomb, and the Ram's-head; but though the objects are great, they did not appear to us either picture&s;que in them&s;elves, or agreeably combined. The ground, particularly beyond the creek, is ill &s;haped.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Salterham &s;eems as unkindly to vegetation, as Mount Edgcomb is friendly to it; and the creek it &s;tands on, is entirely for|&s;aken by the tide at ebb, and becomes a mere channel of ooze. Perhaps in our remarks here we were too much under the impre&s;&s;ion of the gloomy ideas we had brought from Ply|mouth.</P>
<P>From Salterham, we pur&s;ued our route to Ivy-bridge; where, as far as we could judge from the appearance of the river, we &s;hould have met with &s;ome beautiful &s;cenery, if we had had time to examine it.</P>
<P>From hence we proceeded to A&s;hburton, which lies among hills; and Chudleigh, where

are &s;tone-quarries, which at a di&s;tance have the appearance of a grand range of natural rock. Here the bi&s;hops of Exeter formerly re&s;ided. The ruins of the epi&s;copal palace may &s;till be traced.</P>
<P>We were but little amu&s;ed, however, with any thing we &s;aw in this country. The whole of it from Plymouth is but an unintere&s;ting &s;cene. Its very appearance on a map, &s;hews, in &s;ome degree, its unpicture&s;que form. It is in|ter&s;ected with &s;everal rivers, which run in val|lies between oppo&s;ite hills. The&s;e hills we were continually a&s;cending or de&s;cending. When we had mounted one hill, we were pre|&s;ented with the &s;ide of another; &s;o that all di&s;|tance was &s;hut out, and all variety of country intercepted. A plea&s;ant glade here and there, at the dip of a hill, we &s;ometimes had; but this did not compen&s;ate for that tire&s;ome &s;amene&s;s of a&s;cent and de&s;cent which runs through the country.</P>
<P>At Chudleigh we left the great Exeter-road, to &s;ee Mamhead, and Powderham-ca&s;tle. In our
<PB N="245" REF="272">
way we mounted a &s;ort of grand natural <HI>ter|race,</HI> about &s;even miles in length, and three in breadth; though this indeed is a broader &s;ur|face than we commonly di&s;tingui&s;h by that ap|pellation. The name of this eminence is Hal|down-hill.</P>
<P>From hence we had a grand, exten&s;ive, and, in many parts, a picture&s;que di&s;tance; con&s;i&s;t|ing fir&s;t of the whole cour&s;e of the Ex, from Exeter to the &s;ea, the city of Exeter, the town of Top&s;ham, Sir Francis Drake's, and Powder|ham-ca&s;tle. Beyond the&s;e objects, all of which &s;eemed in the di&s;tance to adorn the banks of the river, the eye ranged over immen&s;e plains and woods, hills and vales. Of the&s;e the vale of Honiton, and other celebrated vales made a part. But they were mere &s;pecks, too incon|&s;iderable for the eye to fix on. Di&s;tance had pre&s;&s;ed all the hilly boundaries of the&s;e vales flat to the &s;urface. At lea&s;t it had &s;o dimi|ni&s;hed them, that the proude&s;t appeared only as a ripple on the ocean. The extreme parts of this va&s;t land&s;cape were bounded by the long range of Sedbury-hills; which were tinged, when we &s;aw them, with a light ether hue, &s;carce one &s;hade removed from the colour
<PB N="246" REF="273">
of the &s;ky; the whole immen&s;e &s;cene, there|fore, without the lea&s;t interruption from the hills of the country, faded gradually into air.</P>
<P>A view of this kind gives us a ju&s;t idea of the &s;urface of the globe we inhabit. We talk of its inequalities in a lofty &s;tile. Its mountains a&s;cend the &s;kies; its vallies &s;ink down into depths profound. Whereas, in fact, its ine|qualities are nothing, when compared with its magnitude. If a comprehen&s;ive eye, placed at a di&s;tance from the &s;urface of the earth, were capable of viewing a whole hemi&s;phere toge|ther, all its inequalities, great as we make them, Mount Cauca&s;us, the Andes, Teneriffe, and all the loftie&s;t mountains of the globe, would be compre&s;&s;ed, like the view before us; and the whole would appear perfectly &s;mooth. To us, a bowling green is a level plain; but a minute in&s;ect finds it full of inequalities.</P>
<P>In &s;urveying the windings of the Ex, in its cour&s;e to the &s;ea, we are reminded of a &s;ketch, by a great ma&s;ter, of the cour&s;e of Aufente. It is &s;lightly touched indeed, but with great &s;pi|rit; and the di&s;tances are particularly well

marked. We have it at the end of the &s;eventh Aeneid, where the picture&s;que poet, led by his &s;ubject to mention &s;ome of the countries of Italy, gives us this plea&s;ing view:
<Q><L>&mdash; Queis Jupiter Anxurus arvis</L>
<L>Prae&s;idet; et viridi gaudens Feronia luco;</L>
<L>Qua Saturae jacet atra palus; gelidu&s;que per imas</L>
<L>Quaerit iter valles, atque in mare conditur Ufens.</L></Q>
In this land&s;cape we have fir&s;t the fore-ground, compo&s;ed of the Temple of Jupiter Anxur, proudly &s;eated; and overlooking the neigh|bouring country.
<Q><L>&mdash; Queis Jupiter Anxurus arvis</L>
<L>Prae&s;idet &mdash;</L></Q>
The immediate di&s;tance con&s;i&s;ts of the Temple of Feronia, marked by a grove, which adorns it, and a lake lying at its foot:
<Q><L>&mdash;Viridi gaudens Feronia luco;</L>
<L>Qua Saturae jacet atra palus &mdash;</L></Q>
The lake to which the poet gives the epithet <HI>atra,</HI> had that deep black clear hue, which Claude and Pou&s;&s;in well knew produced often the be&s;t effect. In the &s;econd di&s;tance all <HI>co|lour</HI> is gone; and the fading land&s;cape of cour&s;e takes its a&euml;rial tinge. It is enough now, if a few principal objects are dimly &s;een. A wind|ing

river is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hable. It is di&s;|covered only by its meanders along the plain:
<Q><L>&mdash;Gelidu&s;que per imas</L>
<L>Quaerit iter valles&mdash;</L></Q>
It has not its cour&s;e &s;haped out between high banks, but <HI>&s;eeks out</HI> its pa&s;&s;age, here and there, as the &s;mall depre&s;&s;ions of a flat country allow. Beyond all appears the &s;ea; but the di&s;tance here is &s;o remote, that it is not marked with any degree of &s;trength: no epithet is applied: you can &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h it from the &s;ky. Critici&s;ms of this kind may &s;eem refinement: but there is little doubt, I think, but the poet, in compo&s;ing the&s;e lines, had &s;ome real land|&s;cape &s;trongly formed in his imagination. Chance could not have marked all the&s;e di&s;|tances &s;o very exactly.</P>

<P>THE city of Exeter, which we &s;oon reached, is by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in the we&s;t of England. It is &s;eated rather eminently on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Ex. From this river it derives its name; which is a corruption of Ex|ce&s;ter, or the ca&s;tle on the Ex; a name which gives it a title to Roman origin. The anti|quarian, however, is not obliged merely to ety|mology for his proof of its antiquity. He points out ve&s;tiges of Roman ma&s;onry in the &s;outh gate; he finds variety of coins; and he mea&s;ures the length and breadth of the walls, which form a parallelogram by Roman feet.</P>
<P>Exeter is &s;aid to be very regularly built, having two large airy &s;treets, running through the length and breadth of it, and uniting in the centre. It appeared to us, however, very in|cumbered. We were directed from the bridge to the great church through clo&s;e and di&s;agree|able alleys. The be&s;t part of the town we did not &s;ee; as our time allowed us to examine only the mo&s;t remarkable buildings.</P>

<P><PB N="251" REF="280">On the north &s;ide, the highe&s;t ground is oc|cupied by the ruins of Rugement-ca&s;tle, for|merly the re&s;idence of Saxon kings. From the terrace of this ca&s;tle, and from the walls of the town, we had the &s;ame exten&s;ive view over the country, which we had before from Haldown-hill: but as we now &s;aw them from a different &s;tation, and from a lower point, they were le&s;s grand, but more picture&s;que. Hills which were there compre&s;&s;ed to the &s;urface, began here to ari&s;e, and take their form in the land|&s;cape; breaking the continued lines of di&s;tance, and creating new lights, and new &s;hades with their varied elevations. Towards the mouth of the river, we were told, a light mi&s;t often prevails, when the re&s;t of the land&s;cape to|wards the we&s;t is perfectly clear. We did not &s;ee any appearance of this kind; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it might frequently produce a good effect, not only from the beauty of the mi&s;t it|&s;elf, but from its clearing away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 162.</NOTE>, and leaving &s;ome objects di&s;tinctly &s;een, and others but ob|&s;curely traced.</P>

<P>Few places in England are more renowned in the annals of war, than Exeter. It was three times be&s;ieged by the Danes, once by William the Conqueror, again by King Stephen, a &s;ixth time in the rebellion of Perkin Warbec in the time of Henry VII. again in a rebellion which broke out in the reign of Edward VI. and two or three times more in the civil wars of Charles I. On many of the&s;e occa&s;ions it was regularly garri&s;oned; and the citizens had nothing to do with its defence. But when it re&s;ted on <HI>them,</HI> they generally behaved with re|markable &s;pirit. Many in&s;tances of their gal|lantry are pre&s;erved in hi&s;tory. Henry VII. was &s;o much plea&s;ed with their behaviour, in his time, that he paid them a vi&s;it on purpo&s;e to thank them; and when he left the town, he took his &s;word from his &s;ide, and pre&s;enting it
<PB N="253" REF="282">
to the Mayor, de&s;ired it might always be car|ried before him; which it has been ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the great church at Exeter is remarkable. It was four hundred years in building, under the direction of &s;everal bi&s;hops; each adding &s;omething to complete the de&s;ign; one of them even lengthened the nave of the church by two additional arches. Yet not|with&s;tanding this lap&s;e of time, in which the fa&s;hion of architecture underwent &s;o much change; and notwith&s;tanding the different ar|chitects employed, who&s;e genius and ta&s;te mu&s;t have been very different, it is &s;ingular, that each &s;ucceeding bi&s;hop hath &s;o attentively pur|&s;ued the plan of his predece&s;&s;or, that the whole together &s;trikes the eye as a uniform building. On examining the parts nicely, we may here and there di&s;tingui&s;h the oppo&s;ition of Saxon and Gothic; but, in general, they accord very happily. The we&s;t front is uncommonly rich, and adorned with figures. The nave of the church is fitted up for divine &s;ervice; which may be u&s;eful, but injures the effect.</P>
<P>The curious &s;hould not forget, before he leave the church, to &s;ee the chalice and &s;ap|phire ring, which were dug out of a bi&s;hop's grave, when a new pavement was laid about
<PB N="254" REF="283">
twenty years ago. To what bi&s;hop the ring belonged is only gue&s;&s;ed; but it might be tole|rably a&s;certained by a knowledge of the pro|gre&s;s of art which &s;ome antiquarians po&s;&s;e&s;s. Such a knowledge gives the form and work|man&s;hip of the&s;e curious remains of antiquity to their proper period. If the traveller have a mind al&s;o to plea&s;e his conductor, who leads him through the ai&s;les of the church, he may tell him, he has heard that the great bell, called Peter, weighs above a thou&s;and pounds more than Great Tom at Lincoln; and that the pipes of the organ are wider than tho&s;e of any organ in Europe. Both the&s;e accounts he will pro|bably hear confirmed with great &s;olemnity, though the latter of them is a mi&s;take; and as to the former, both it and its rival at Lincoln are mere hand-bells compared with the great bell at Mo&s;cow, which weighs 432,000 pounds, and mea&s;ures at its mouth above twenty-one yards.</P>

<P>FROM Exeter to Honiton we pa&s;&s;ed through a rich country, yet &s;omewhat flatter than we had met with on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Exeter. We found, however, here and there, an emi|nence, which gave us a view of the di&s;tances around. At Fair-mile-hill, particularly, a very <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> view opened before us; but nothing can make it plea&s;ing, as it is <HI>bounded by a hard edge.</HI> A di&s;tance &s;hould either melt into the &s;ky, or terminate in a &s;oft and varied moun|tain line <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This high ground, which appeared at a <HI>di&s;|tance</HI> as a <HI>hard edge,</HI> is on the &s;pot a grand ter|race, running eight or nine miles from Honi|ton to Sidmouth, pre&s;enting &s;ometimes the &s;ea, and &s;ometimes a variety of hills, vales, and di&s;|tances, with which the country abounds. We had not time, however, to explore the &s;everal beauties of the land&s;cape it overlooks. Night came on before we reached Honiton, and drew a veil over all the objects of the horizon.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="285">At Honiton we intended to &s;leep; but it was ordered otherwi&s;e. This town having been twice burnt down within the&s;e la&s;t thirty years, the inhabitants take a very effectual me|thod to prevent the cata&s;trophe a third time, by appointing all travellers to the office of watchmen. About twelve o'clock a fellow begins his operations with a mon&s;trous hand-bell, and a hoar&s;e voice, informing us, that all is &s;afe. This &s;erenade is repeated every quar|ter of an hour, with great propriety; for in that portion of time, it may rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed the traveller, who is ignorant of the in|&s;titution, and not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch nocturnal|din in a country-town, cannot well get his &s;en&s;es compo&s;ed, e&s;pecially as his ear will naturally lie in expectation of each periodical peal. In the mean time, the &s;ly inhabitant, who is u&s;ed to the&s;e noi&s;es of the night, enjoys a quiet repo&s;e. The in&s;titution may be good: we only wi&s;hed it had been intimated to us before, that we might have had an option in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We had now travelled between &s;eventy and eighty miles from Plymouth, and found the whole of the country, (except the little devi|ation
<PB N="257" REF="286">
we made from Chudleigh, to examine the &s;cenery about the Ex,) unvaried and unin|tere&s;ting. Like an immen&s;e piece of high furrowed land, at lea&s;t as far as Exeter, it is continually ri&s;ing and falling; and though it has its beauties, yet they are chiefly &s;een near the coa&s;t, where its vallies break down, and open to the &s;ea; and where its e&s;tuaries often form very plea&s;ing &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The road from Plymouth to Honiton, by the <HI>&s;ea-coa&s;t,</HI> was the road we ought to have taken; but as it had not been pointed out to us as particularly picture&s;que, we took the upper road merely for want of better information. I &s;hall, however, give the reader a &s;ketch of the <HI>coa&s;t,</HI> from &s;ome hints which I have had on good picture&s;que authority. I have al&s;o my|&s;elf &s;een a great variety of accurate drawings of this coa&s;t, which have given me a &s;trong idea of its character.</P>

<P>FROM Plymouth, according to this route, you make the fir&s;t &s;tage to Totne&s;s; and &s;o far the country wears nearly the &s;ame face which it did between Plymouth and A&s;h|burton. You cro&s;s the &s;ame rivers, a&s;cend the &s;ame hills, and fall into the &s;ame vallies.</P>
<P>This is a country, however, in which the farmer glories; though the painter treats it with neglect. Here the acre fills the bu&s;hel with abundant increa&s;e; and here the ox does credit to his pa&s;ture. But though the country abounds in corn and pa&s;turage, cyder is its &s;taple. The cyder of the South Hams, which is the name of a great part of this country, is every where famous.</P>
<P>At Totne&s;s you meet the Dart; down which river you may &s;ail, about &s;ix or &s;even miles, to Dartmouth. This little navigation I have heard much extolled as a peculiar &s;cene of beauty; but I have heard others on who&s;e judgment I can more rely, &s;peak of it with le&s;s emotion. And yet I can ea&s;ily imagine,
<PB N="259" REF="288">
that two people of equally picture&s;que ta&s;te, may conceive differently of the &s;ame &s;cene. They may have different conceptions of beauty, though the conceptions of each may be very ju&s;t; or they may examine the &s;ame &s;cene under different circum&s;tances. A favourable, or an unfavourable light makes a greater alter|ation in any &s;cene, than a per&s;on unaccu&s;tomed to examine nature would ea&s;ily imagine.</P>
<P>At Dartmouth you have a great variety of intere&s;ting views. The bay, which the river forms at its mouth, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes on the coa&s;t. Both the entrance of the Dart into it, and its exit to the &s;ea, appear from many &s;tations clo&s;ed up by the folding of the banks; &s;o that the bay has frequently the form of a lake, only furni&s;hed with &s;hipping in&s;tead of boats. Its banks are its great beauty; which con&s;i&s;t of lofty wooded hills, &s;helving down in all directions. You would not ex|pect &s;uch &s;cenery on a &s;ea-coa&s;t: but the woods by being well &s;heltered grow luxuriantly.</P>
<P>And yet an eye ver&s;ed in the various &s;cenes of nature, would ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e bays from the pa&s;toral &s;implicity of an inland-lake. The &s;ea always impre&s;&s;es a peculiar character on its bays. The water has a different a&s;pect;
<PB N="260" REF="289">
its tints are more varied, and its &s;urface differ|ently di&s;turbed. Its banks too have a more weather-beaten and ragged appearance, lo&s;ing generally their verdure within the air of the &s;ea. The &s;ea-rock al&s;o wants that rich incru&s;|tation of mo&s;&s;es and lychens, which adorns the rock of the lake; and the wood, though it grow luxuriantly, as it does here, &s;hews plainly by its mode of growth, that it is the inhabitant of a &s;ea-girt clime. To this may be added, that the appendages of the bay and lake are dif|ferent. A quay perhaps for landing goods, an anchor, a floating buoy, or a group of figures in &s;eamen's jackets, are the ornaments of one &s;cene, but unknown to the other.</P>
<P>The bay, in the mean time, may be as pic|ture&s;que as the lake. All I mean to point out is, that the <HI>character</HI> of each is different; and therefore in painting they &s;hould not be con|founded. Its <HI>particular value</HI> each receives from the fancy of the &s;pectator. As was ju&s;t ob&s;erved, people may have different concep|tions of beauty, and yet the conceptions of both may be equally ju&s;t. The pa&s;toral &s;implicity of the lake may plea&s;e one per&s;on, and the bu&s;tle of the bay another. I &s;hall only add, that repre&s;entations of the two &s;cenes are ex|ceedingly
<PB N="261" REF="290">
well &s;uited as companions to each other.</P>
<P>At the opening of Dartmouth-bay to the &s;ea, appears the town of Dartmouth, a&s;cending a hill. Its ca&s;tle, at the di&s;tance of a mile, &s;tands clo&s;e to the water's edge. On the other &s;ide, acro&s;s the bay, ri&s;es King&s;were, a &s;ort of &s;uburb, belonging to the town. The winding of the bay, and the varied beauty of its banks are &s;een to great advantage in a walk which carries you from the town of Dartmouth to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>All this coa&s;t affords excellent fi&s;h. The &s;ole breeds here in great abundance, and the john dory delights in it, as its mo&s;t favourite haunt. The Torbay-boat often brings this delicious fi&s;h to the tables of the luxurious: but the epicure, who wi&s;hes to eat it in per|fection, does not think a journey to the&s;e coa&s;ts too much. At Totne&s;s great quantities of &s;almon-peal are taken in an uncommon mode of fi&s;hing. The fi&s;h are intercepted, as the water ebbs, by dogs, which &s;wim|ming after the &s;hoal, are taught to drive them up the river into clo&s;e nets provided to receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="291">Dartmouth harbour is a very bu&s;y &s;cene when a &s;hoal of pilchards enters it, as they often do at particular &s;ea&s;ons, driven in by porpoi&s;es, which lie off at &s;ea in expectation of them. The &s;hoal di&s;covers it&s;elf by the tre|mulous motion of the water, and the leaping of the fi&s;h here and there on the &s;urface. On this appearance every boat that can &s;wim, puts off from the &s;hore with nets. The whole would make a bu&s;y and entertaining water &s;cene, if it were well painted.</P>
<P>From Dartmouth you return with the tide tide to Totne&s;s. From thence, in the way to Brixham, you may vi&s;it the grand ruins of Berry-Pomeroy-ca&s;tle. This fortre&s;s belonged formerly to a family of the name of Pomeroy; which being &s;eated there by the Conqueror, kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, during all the various re|volutions of England, till the reign of Ed|ward VI. It was once a formidable place; and its ruins are &s;till magnificent. The grand gate-way remains entire, together with a round tower. A great part of the wall is &s;tanding, and many of the chambers may be traced.</P>
<P>From hence you proceed to Brixham, where the naturali&s;t finds him&s;elf puzzled with a well,
<PB N="263" REF="292">
which ebbs and flows, though the waters are not in the lea&s;t bracki&s;h, but pure and limpid, which &s;eems to indicate they have no commu|nication with tides.</P>
<P>Near Brixham you begin to &s;kirt that cele|brated inlet of the &s;ea, called Torbay. It is a grand &s;cene, and affords many magnificent views, if you have lei&s;ure to circle the bay in que&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Its general form is &s;emilunar, inclo&s;ing a cir|cumference of about twelve miles. Its wind|ing &s;hores on both &s;ides are &s;kreened with grand ramparts of rock; between which, in the central part, the ground from the country, forming a gentle vale, falls ea&s;ily to the water's edge. Wood grows all round the bay, even on its <HI>rocky &s;ides;</HI> where it can get footing, and &s;helter; but in the <HI>central part</HI> with great lux|uriance.</P>
<P>In this delicious &s;pot &s;tood formerly Tor-abbey, the ruins of which &s;till remain. Its &s;itu|ation was grand and beautiful. Wooded hills, de&s;cending on every &s;ide, &s;kreened and adorned it both behind and on its flanks. In front the bay opening before it, &s;pread its circling rocky cheeks, like a va&s;t colonade, le&s;&s;ening in all the plea&s;ing forms of per&s;pective; and receiving
<PB N="264" REF="293">
all the variety of light and &s;hade, which the &s;un veering round from morning till evening, throws upon them. Here a &s;ociety of monks dwelt in peaceful &s;ecurity. The enemy's fleet more than once, in former times, ravaged the coa&s;t, and burnt Dartmouth and other towns. The abbey feared no mi&s;chief. All it had to do, was to open its ho&s;pitable gates, and give an a&s;ylum to the terrified fugitives of the country.</P>
<P>This noble bay has afforded its protection many a time to the fleets of England, which in their full array ride &s;afely within its ample ba&s;on. But it appeared in its greate&s;t glory on the fifth of November 1688, when King William entered it with fifty &s;ail of the line, and four hundred tran&s;ports. The &s;hips in|deed were Dutch; but a Briti&s;h admiral led the van, and a Briti&s;h flag flew at the ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>From Torbay your next &s;tage is Newton-Bu&s;hel, where, cro&s;&s;ing the Teign, you ride along the banks of that river to Teign-mouth. In your way you are entertained with a variety of river views. But Nature, laying a&s;ide here in a great degree her rocks and bold &s;hores, works with &s;ofter materials. The banks of the

Teign, I under&s;tand, are rather cultivated than wild; though at its mouth it receives the &s;ea with rocks, which are both magnificent and beautiful. They are covered, like the genera|lity of the rocks on this coa&s;t, with a profu&s;ion of wood.</P>
<P>From Teign-mouth you &s;kirt the &s;hore to the mouth of the Ex, over which you ferry at the bar. Here the country grows &s;omewhat bolder, but rather in the form of &s;welling hills. The&s;e hills likewi&s;e are profu&s;ely covered with wood, which &s;weeps almo&s;t down to the water's edge. But as you take a view of them with your back to the &s;ea, they appear in &s;till greater magnificence, uniting with the woods of the country. Tho&s;e of Powderham-ca&s;tle receive them fir&s;t; and beyond the&s;e you &s;ee ri&s;ing and &s;tretching into di&s;tance the woods of Mam-head, in rich, though indi&s;tinct, luxuriance.</P>
<P>The Ex is by far the noble&s;t river in this part of the coa&s;t. It empties a profu&s;e chan|nel into the &s;ea, and forms a ba&s;on at its mouth, which would be an excellent harbour for a royal navy, if it were not ob&s;tructed by a bar. When the tide flows, however, &s;hips of con|&s;iderable burthen advance as far as Top&s;ham, and could formerly have proceeded with equal
<PB N="266" REF="295">
ea&s;e to the walls of Exeter; but a little above Top&s;ham the channel of the river is again ob|&s;tructed.</P>
<P>The tradition of the country a&s;cribes this ob&s;truction to a quarrel between the Mayor of Exeter, and an Earl of Devon&s;hire. The earl claimed the fir&s;t &s;almon that was taken in the &s;ea&s;on, as an acknowledgment of his juri&s;|diction over the river. The mayor claimed it as a perqui&s;ite of his office. The earl's claim appears to have been wor&s;e founded; becau&s;e, in&s;tead of appealing to the laws for redre&s;s, he had recour&s;e to private revenge. Both &s;ides of the river were his property; and both &s;ides clo&s;ely wooded with ancient oak. The&s;e trees he cut down in abundance, and threw them into the channel of the river. The tide after|wards carrying up with it great quantities of &s;and and gravel, formed this ob&s;truction by degrees into &s;uch a barrier, as could never afterwards be removed. If this tradition be well grounded, we have &s;eldom an in&s;tance of revenge in &s;o grand a &s;tyle. Mo&s;t people, who &s;eek gratifications of this kind, are &s;atisfied with revenging them&s;elves on the per&s;on who had offended them. But the Earl of Devon|&s;hire not only revenged him&s;elf on the Mayor
<PB N="267" REF="296">
of Exeter; but on the whole city, and for all future times.</P>
<P>About &s;eventy years ago the inhabitants of Exeter cut a new channel for the river, and built very expen&s;ive locks upon it; by means of which they can now bring ve&s;&s;els of &s;ome burthen to the town.</P>
<P>From the mouth of the Ex the coa&s;t affords nothing very intere&s;ting, till you come to the mouth of the Sid. This river opens into the &s;ea between high promontories; that on the we&s;t is particularly lofty, and much broken, though not rocky, and is repre&s;ented as afford|ing many picture&s;que views. But here is no ba&s;on opening into the land, as in the other rivers of this coa&s;t. The Sid is a mere rural &s;tream, and pre&s;erves its character pure to the very &s;hores of the ocean.</P>
<P>The valley through which it takes its cour&s;e, is a &s;cene of peculiar con&s;truction. It forms a gentle de&s;cent towards the &s;ea between two &s;teep hills which leave little more room at the bottom, than what the road and the river oc|cupy. So that, in fact, it has hardly the dimen&s;ions of a valley, but might rather be called a cleft in the higher grounds, running down to the &s;ea. The hills, however, which
<PB N="268" REF="297">
compo&s;e its &s;ides, are not (like the narrow vallies of a mountainous and rocky country) ab|rupt and broken; but con&s;i&s;t chiefly of rich pa&s;turage, and are covered with flocks and herds. They are adorned too with wood; and though in their cour&s;e they now and then wind a little, they generally lead the valley in a &s;traight line from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P>Through this narrow valley you ri&s;e &s;lowly near the &s;pace of nine miles. So long an a&s;|cent, though in all parts gradual, rai&s;es you at length to a great height. At the conclu&s;ion of the valley, you find your&s;elf on a lofty down; from whence you have &s;ome of the grande&s;t views which this country, rich in di&s;tances, affords. You look chiefly towards the we&s;t, and take in an amazing compa&s;s; indeed all the di&s;trict on both &s;ides of the Ex, as far as the &s;ea. The&s;e high grounds formed that <HI>hard edge,</HI> and made that peculiar appearance, which we ob&s;erved in the road between Exeter and Honiton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 225.</NOTE>. From the&s;e lofty downs you de|&s;cend gently into Honiton, where the&s;e two different routes from Plymouth unite.</P>

<P>AS we left Honiton, the ob&s;curity of a hazy morning over&s;pread its vale; the pictu|re&s;que beauty of which we had heard much commended. If, therefore, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any, (which from the analogy of the country may be que&s;tioned,) we are not qualified to give any account of it. A mi&s;ty morning, in gene|ral, gives new beauty to a country; but we mu&s;t catch its beautiful appearance, as we do all the other <HI>accidental</HI> appearances of Nature, at a proper cri&s;is. We left Honiton at too early an hour in the morning to &s;ee the full effect of the mi&s;t. It rather blotted out, than adorned, the face of the country. The mo&s;t picture&s;que moment of a mi&s;ty morning is ju&s;t as the &s;un ri&s;es, and begins its contention with the vapours which ob&s;truct its rays. That ap|pearance we had &s;oon after, and in &s;uch profu|&s;ion, that it gave a beautiful effect to a land|&s;cape, which &s;eemed not calculated to produce much effect without it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="299">We have a &s;triking picture of a morning-&s;un, though unaccompanied by mi&s;t, in the &s;hort account given us of Lot's e&s;cape from Sodom.

Images, which may &s;hine under the poet's de&s;cription, are not per|haps at the &s;ame time picture&s;que; though I believe every picture&s;que object is capable of &s;hining as a poetical one. The pa&s;&s;age before us is both poetical and picture&s;que. A relation of the plain fact would have been neither. If the pa&s;&s;age had been coldly tran&s;lated, <HI>Lot ar|rived at Zoar about &s;un-ri&s;e;</HI> the &s;en&s;e had been pre&s;erved, but the picture would have been lo&s;t.

The fir&s;t part of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the &s;un was ri&s;en upon the earth,</HI> brings immediately before the eye, (through the <HI>connection</HI> of the &s;un and the earth,) the rays of a morning &s;un &s;triking the tops of the hills and promontories; while the other part of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Lot entered into Zoar,</HI> brings before us (through the &s;ame
<PB N="271" REF="300">
happy mode of rai&s;ing and connecting images) a road, the gates of the town, and the patriarch approaching it. Not, by the way, that we &s;hould wi&s;h to introduce the <HI>&s;tory</HI> of Lot's retreat, with any <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> into the picture. The prin|cipal part would be the <HI>land&s;cape;</HI> and Lot could only be a di&s;tant figure to adorn it, and in that light unnece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> introduced as the <HI>ornament of land&s;cape</HI> appears ab&s;urd. In Ba&s;&s;on, and &s;ome other matters, &s;uch intro|ductions are frequent. We con&s;ider, there|fore, the pa&s;&s;age before us merely as <HI>land&s;cape,</HI> and lay little &s;tre&s;s on the <HI>figures.</HI> Reubens has thrown a fine glow of colouring into a picture on this &s;ubject, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of Marlbrough. But Reubens has in|troduced, as he ought, the figures on the <HI>fore-ground,</HI> making the land&s;cape entirely an <HI>un|der-part.</HI> I forget whether he has given his picture the full effect it might receive by throwing the back &s;cenery into that grand &s;hade, &s;ugge&s;ted by the words of &s;cripture, the <HI>&s;moke of the country went up as the &s;moke of a furnace.</HI> The atmo&s;phere al&s;o might have a good effect, tinged with the ruddy glare of fire blended with the &s;moke.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="301">As the mi&s;t cleared away, and we &s;aw more of the country around, its picture&s;que charms did not increa&s;e upon us. If the hills and dales, however, of which the whole country is compo&s;ed, po&s;&s;e&s;s little of this kind of beauty, they po&s;&s;e&s;s what is better, the riches of &s;oil, and cultivation in a high degree. If any val|lies can be &s;aid to <HI>laugh and &s;ing,</HI> the&s;e certainly may. Nothing can exceed either their tillage or their pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>Among the beautiful objects we occa&s;ion|ally met with in this country, the cattle, which every where grazed its rich pa&s;tures, were worthy of remark. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e we &s;aw &s;eemed to be of a peculiar breed, elegantly and neatly formed, rather &s;mall, generally red, growing gradually darker towards the head and &s;houlders. Their horns, which are &s;hort, are tipped with black; their coats are fine, and their heads &s;mall.</P>
<P>At Axmin&s;ter the carpet-works are worth vi&s;iting. Some of them di&s;play a very rich combination of colours; but in general, they are &s;o gay, that furniture mu&s;t be glaring to be

in harmony with them. Of cour&s;e they are too gay to be beautiful.</P>
<P>No carpeting, perhaps, equals the Per&s;ian in beauty. The Turkey carpet is mode&s;t enough in its colouring; but its texture is coar&s;e, and its pattern con&s;i&s;ts commonly of &s;uch a jumble of incoherent parts, that the eye &s;eldom traces any meaning in its plan. The Briti&s;h carpet again has <HI>too much meaning.</HI> It often repre|&s;ents fruits, and flowers, and ba&s;kets, and other things, which are generally ill repre&s;ented, or awkwardly larger than the life, or at lea&s;t im|properly placed under our feet. The Per&s;ian carpet avoids the&s;e two extremes. It &s;eldom exhibits any <HI>real forms,</HI> and yet, in&s;tead of the di&s;orderly pattern that deforms the Turkey carpet, it u&s;ually pre&s;ents &s;ome neat and ele|gant plan, within the compartments of which its colours, though rich, are mode&s;t.

<P>FROM Axmin&s;ter we left the great road to vi&s;it Ford-abbey.</P>
<P>In a &s;eque&s;tered part of the country, where Devon&s;hire and Dor&s;et&s;hire unite, lies a cir|cular valley, about a mile and half in diameter.</P>
<P>Its &s;ides &s;lope gently into its area in various directions; but are no where &s;teep. Woody &s;kreens, circling its precincts, conceal its bounds; and in many parts connecting with the trees, which de&s;cend into the bo&s;om of the valley, form them&s;elves into various tufted groves. Through the middle of this &s;weet retreat winds a &s;tream, not foaming among broken rocks, nor &s;ounding down cataracts; but mild like the &s;cene it accompanies, and in cadence not ex|ceeding a gentle murmur. From this retreat all foreign &s;cenery is excluded. It wants no adventitious ornaments; &s;ufficiently ble&s;&s;ed with its own &s;weet groves and &s;olitude.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Such <HI>land&s;cape</HI></L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament;</L>
<L>But is, when unadorned, adorned the mo&s;t.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="275" REF="304">This happy retirement was once &s;acred to religion. Verging towards one &s;ide of the valley &s;tand the ruins of Ford-abbey. It has never been of large dimen&s;ions, but was a model of the mo&s;t perfect Gothic, if we may credit its remains, particularly tho&s;e of a cloi&s;|ter, which are equal to any thing we have in that &s;tyle of architecture. This beautiful frag|ment con&s;i&s;ts of eight windows, with light but|tre&s;&s;es between them, and joins a ruined chapel on one &s;ide, and on the other a hall or refec|tory, which &s;till pre&s;erves its form &s;ufficiently to give an idea of its ju&s;t proportions. To this is connected by ruined walls a ma&s;&s;y tower. What the ancient u&s;e of this fabric was, whe|ther it belonged to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil part of the mona&s;tery, is not now apparent; but at pre&s;ent it gives a picture&s;que form to the ruin, which appears to more advantage by the pre-eminence of &s;ome &s;uperior part <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At right angles with the chapel runs ano|ther cloi&s;ter, a longer building, but of coar&s;er workman&s;hip, and almo&s;t covered with ivy. The river, which enters the valley at the di&s;|tance of about half a mile from the ruin, takes
<PB N="276" REF="305">
a &s;weep towards it, and pa&s;&s;ing under this cloi&s;|ter, opens into what was once the great court, and makes its exit through an arch in the wall on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.
<Q><L>This venerable pile,</L>
<L>&mdash;clad in the mo&s;&s;y ve&s;t of fleeting time,</L></Q>
and decorated all over with variety of lychens, &s;treaming weather-&s;tains, and twi&s;ting &s;hrubs, is &s;haded by ancient oaks, which, hanging over it, adorn its broken walls without encumbering them. In &s;hort, the valley, the river, the path, and the ruins are all highly plea&s;ing; the <HI>parts</HI> are beautiful, and the <HI>whole</HI> is harmonious.</P>
<P>They who have lately &s;een Ford-abbey will &s;tare at this de&s;cription of it. And well may they &s;tare; for this de&s;cription antedates its pre&s;ent &s;tate by at lea&s;t a century. If they had &s;een it in the year 1675, they might probably have &s;een it as it is here de&s;cribed. Now, alas! it wears another face. It has been in the hands of <HI>improvement.</HI> Its &s;implicity is gone; and mi&s;erable ravage has been made through every part. The ruin is patched up into an awkward dwelling; old parts and new are blended toge|ther, to the mutual di&s;grace of both. The ele|gant cloi&s;ter is &s;till left; but it is completely
<PB N="277" REF="306">
repaired, white-wa&s;hed, and converted into a green-hou&s;e. The hall too is modernized, and every other part. Sa&s;h-windows glare over pointed arches, and Gothic walls are adorned with Indian paper.</P>
<P>The grounds have undergone the &s;ame re|formation. The natural groves and lawns are de&s;troyed; vi&s;tas and regular &s;lopes &s;upply their room. The winding path, which con|templation naturally marked out, is gone; &s;uc|ceeded by &s;traight walks, and terraces adorned with urns and &s;tatues; while the river and its fringed banks have given way to canals and &s;tew-ponds. In a word, a &s;cene abounding with &s;o many natural beauties was never per|haps more wretchedly deformed.</P>
<P>When a man exerci&s;es his crude ideas on a few vulgar acres, it is of little con&s;equence. The injury is ea&s;ily repaired; and if not, the lo&s;s is trifling. But when he lets loo&s;e his de|praved ta&s;te, his ab&s;urd invention, and his gracele&s;s hands on &s;uch a &s;ubject as this, where art and nature united cannot re&s;tore the havoc he makes, we con&s;ider &s;uch a deed under the &s;ame black character in matters of picture&s;que beauty, as we do &s;acrilege and bla&s;phemy in matters of religion. The effects of &s;uper&s;tition
<PB N="278" REF="307">
we abhor. Some little atonement, however, this implacable power might have made in ta&s;te, for its mi&s;chiefs in religion, if it had de|terred our ance&s;tors from connecting their man&s;ions with ruins once dedicated to &s;acred u&s;es. We might then have enjoyed in per|fection many noble &s;cenes, which are now either entirely effaced or mi&s;erably mangled.</P>
<P>Before we leave the&s;e &s;cenes, I mu&s;t relate a &s;tory of the monks of Ford, which does great credit to their piety. It happened (in what century tradition &s;ays not) that a gentleman of the name of Courtney, a benefactor to the abbey, was overtaken at &s;ea by a violent &s;torm; and the &s;eamen having toiled many hours in vain, and being entirely &s;pent, abandoned them&s;elves to de&s;pair. <Q>My good lads,</Q> (&s;aid Courtney, calling them together, and pulling out his watch, if watches were then in u&s;e,) <Q>My good lads, you &s;ee it is now four o'clock. At five we &s;hall certainly be relieved. At that hour the monks of Ford ri&s;e to their de|votions, and in their prayers to St. Francis, will be &s;ure to rembember me among their benefactors; and you will have the benefit of being &s;aved in my company. Per&s;evere only one hour, and you may depend on
<PB N="279" REF="308">
what I &s;ay.</Q> This &s;peech reanimated the whole crew. Some flew to the pump, others to the leak; all was life and &s;pirit. By this vigorous effort, at five o'clock the &s;hip was &s;o near the &s;hore, that &s;he ea&s;ily reached it; and St. Francis got all the credit of the e&s;cape.</P>

<P>FROM Ford-abbey we were obliged to re|turn to Axmin&s;ter, and from thence we &s;et out for Bridport, traver&s;ing va&s;t cultivated hills, from which, on the left, we had views into the country, and on the right, over the &s;ea. The i&s;le of Portland ranged in the di&s;tance, many leagues along the &s;hore, forming a long white beach; which made an uncommon appearance.</P>
<P>From Bridport to Dorche&s;ter we pa&s;&s;ed through a more inland country, though in other re&s;pects &s;imilar to the country we had ju&s;t left. The features of it are broad and determined. Sweeping hills with har&s;h edges inter&s;ect each other. Here and there a bot|tom is cultivated, inclo&s;ed, and adorned with a farm-hou&s;e and a few trees; but, in general, the whole country is an extended down. It is every where fed with little rough &s;heep; which have formed it, with con&s;tant grazing, into the fine&s;t pa&s;turage. Indeed a chalky &s;oil it&s;elf, which is the &s;ub&s;tratum of the&s;e downs,
<PB N="281" REF="310">
is naturally inclined to produce a neat &s;mooth &s;urface. The &s;everal flocks which pa&s;ture the&s;e wide domains, have their re&s;pective walks; and are generally found within the di&s;tance of a mile from each other. We &s;aw them once or twice i&s;&s;uing from their pens, to take their morning's repa&s;t after a hungry night. It was a plea&s;ing &s;ight to &s;ee &s;uch numbers of in|nocent animals made happy, and in the follow|ing lines it is beautifully de&s;cribed:
<Q><L>&mdash;The fold</L>
<L>Poured out its &s;leecy tenants o'er the glebe.</L>
<L>At fir&s;t, progre&s;&s;ive as a &s;tream, they &s;ought</L>
<L>The middle field; but &s;cattered by degrees</L>
<L>In various groups, they whitened all the land.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the progre&s;&s;ive motion here de&s;cribed, is one of tho&s;e incidents, which is a better &s;ub|ject for poetry than painting. For, in the fir&s;t place, a <HI>feeding flock</HI> is &s;eldom well <HI>grouped;</HI> they commonly <HI>&s;eparate;</HI> or, as the poet well expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>they are &s;cattered by degrees, and whiten all the land.</HI> Nor are their attitudes varied, as they all u&s;ually move the &s;ame way, <HI>progre&s;&s;ive like a &s;tream.</HI> Indeed the &s;hape of a <HI>feeding &s;heep</HI> is not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, as its back and neck make a round heavy line, which in contra&s;t only has its effect. To &s;ee a flock
<PB N="282" REF="311">
of &s;heep in their mo&s;t picture&s;que form, we &s;hould &s;ee them repo&s;ing after their meal is over; and if they are in &s;un&s;hine, they are &s;till the more beautiful. In <HI>repo&s;ing</HI> they are gene|rally better grouped, and their forms are more varied. Some are commonly &s;tanding, and others lying on the ground, with their little ruminating heads in various forms. And if the light be &s;trong, it &s;preads over the whole one general ma&s;s; and is contra&s;ted, at the &s;ame time, by a &s;hadow equally &s;trong, which the flock throws upon the ground. It may be ob|&s;erved al&s;o, that the fleece it&s;elf is well di&s;po&s;ed to receive a beautiful effect of light. It does not indeed, like the &s;mooth covering of hair, allow the eye to trace the mu&s;cular form of the animal. But it has a beauty of a different kind: the flakine&s;s of the wool catches the light, and breaking it into many parts, yet without de&s;troying the ma&s;s, gives it a peculiar rich|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;aw another circum&s;tance al&s;o, in which &s;heep appear to advantage. The weather was &s;ultry, the day calm, and the roads du&s;ty. Along the&s;e roads we &s;aw, once or twice, a flock of &s;heep driven, which rai&s;ed a con&s;ider|able cloud. As we were a little higher on the
<PB N="283" REF="312">
downs, and not annoyed by the du&s;t, the cir|cum&s;tance was amu&s;ing. The beauty of the incident lay in the contra&s;t between &s;uch &s;heep as were <HI>&s;een perfectly,</HI> and &s;uch as were <HI>in|volved in ob&s;curity.</HI> At the &s;ame time the du&s;t became a kind of harmonizing medium, which united the flock into one whole. It had the &s;ame effect on a group of animals, which a heavy mi&s;t, when partial, has on land&s;cape. But though circum&s;tances of this kind are plea&s;ing in nature, we do not wi&s;h to &s;ee them imitated on canvas. They have been tried by Loutherberg, who with a laudable endeavour hath attempted many different <HI>effects;</HI> but I think in this he has failed. He has repre|&s;ented the du&s;ty atmo&s;phere of rapid wheels. But it is an incident that cannot be imitated: for, as motion enters nece&s;&s;arily into the idea, and as you cannot de&s;cribe motion, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to give more than half the idea. It is otherwi&s;e with vapour, which, from the <HI>light mi&s;t</HI> to the <HI>&s;leeping fog,</HI> is of a more perma|nent nature, and therefore more adapted to the pencil.</P>
<P>The only circum&s;tance which can make a cloud of du&s;t an object of imitation, is <HI>di&s;tance;</HI> as this gives it &s;omewhat of a &s;tationary ap|pearance.
<PB N="284" REF="313">
One of the grande&s;t ideas of this kind, which I remember to have met with, may be found in Zenophon's Anaba&s;is.</P>
<P>As Cyrus was approaching Artaxerxes over one of tho&s;e va&s;t plains which are often found in the ea&s;t, a hor&s;eman, who had been making ob&s;ervations, returned at full &s;peed, crying out to the troops, as he rode through them, that the enemy was at hand.

<P><PB N="285" REF="314">The extended plains of Dor&s;et&s;hire, however de&s;olate they now appear, have once been bu&s;y &s;cenes. The antiquarian finds rich employ|ment among them for his curio&s;ity. To fol|low him in que&s;t of every heaving hilloc, and to hear a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of conjectures about the traces of a Dani&s;h or a Roman mattoc, where the eye of common ob&s;ervation perceives no traces at all, might be tedious; but he &s;hews us &s;everal fragments of antiquity on the&s;e plains, which are truly curious; and convinces us, that few places in England have been more con&s;iderable in Roman times than Dorche&s;ter. Poundbury and Maiden-ca&s;tle, as they are called, are both extraordinary remains of Ro|man &s;tations; the latter e&s;pecially, which en|compa&s;&s;es a large &s;pace of ground. Number|le&s;s tumuli al&s;o are thrown up all over the downs. The&s;e were antiquities in the times even of the Romans them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t valuable fragment on the&s;e plains, is a Roman amphitheatre, about half a mile from Dorche&s;ter. It is con&s;tructed only of earth; but it is of &s;o firm a texture, that it retains its complete form to this day. Its mounds are of immen&s;e thickne&s;s, and &s;eem to be at lea&s;t twenty feet high. The area con|tains
<PB N="286" REF="315">
about an acre of land, and is now a corn field. There are two openings in the mound oppo&s;ed to each other, which have formerly been gates. The circumference without, ap|pears circular to the eye, though, in fact, I believe it is rather oval; the in&s;ide is <HI>apparently</HI> &s;o. The difference of the figure &s;eems to have been occa&s;ioned by the &s;welling of the mound within, where the &s;eats have been di&s;po&s;ed. This piece of antiquity is known by the name of <HI>Maumbery.</HI> How much it re&s;embles in form and &s;ize the old amphitheatres now &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting in Italy, may be &s;een from the following de&s;cription of one near Nice. <Q>I made a &s;e|cond excur&s;ion to the&s;e ancient ruins, and mea&s;ured the area of the amphitheatre with thread. It is an oval figure, the longe&s;t dia|meter extending about a hundred and thir|teen yards, and the &s;horte&s;t about eighty. In the centre of it was a &s;quare &s;tone, with an iron ring, to which I &s;uppo&s;e the wild bea&s;ts were tied, to prevent their &s;pringing upon the &s;pectators. Some of the &s;eats re|main, with two oppo&s;ite entrances, con&s;i&s;ting each of one large gate, and two &s;maller late|ral doors, arched: there is al&s;o a con&s;ider|able portion of the external wall; but no
<PB N="287" REF="316">
columns or other ornaments of architec|ture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Smollett's Letters.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>On comparing the amphitheatre of Dor|che&s;ter with this at Nice, we find the form of both exactly &s;imilar; and no great difference in the &s;ize. The area of Maumbery is two hundred and eighteen feet, by a hundred and &s;ixty-three. Dr. Stukely calculates, that it might have contained about thirteen thou&s;and people. At Mrs. Canning's execution, who was burnt in the middle of this amphitheatre for the murder of her hu&s;band, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have contained in the area, and on the mounds, at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and &s;pectators. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that Camden takes not the lea&s;t notice of this &s;ingular piece of antiquity.</P>
<P>Dorche&s;ter, as we may judge from the&s;e no|ble remains, was a place of great con&s;ideration in Roman times. The works of Maiden-ca&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ed to be capable of receiving fifteen thou&s;and men, &s;hew plainly the con&s;equence of this &s;tation in a military light; and I know not, that the erection of an amphitheatre was thought nece&s;&s;ary in any other part of Britain; at lea&s;t we have not, that I recollect, the re|mains
<PB N="288" REF="317">
of any other that is well a&s;certained, except that at Sylche&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Dorche&s;ter is plea&s;ant. It &s;tands on a high bank of the Frome, and is &s;urrounded with dry &s;heep-downs, on which, however, the plough has lately made large en|croachments. The town is clean, and well built; and round it is a variety of plea&s;ant walks, which, to a certain degree, I think, &s;hould always en|gage the attention of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Dorche&s;ter are many gentlemen's &s;eats, well worth vi&s;iting. The woody dips among the&s;e downy hills af|ford naturally very fine &s;ituations. The only one, however, which we regretted our not being able to &s;ee, was Milton-abbey, the &s;eat of Lord Milton, which lies about three miles from Dorche&s;ter. The day which we had laid out for &s;eeing it was rainy, and we had not time to wait for a better. The capital feature of the land&s;cape, we were told, is a valley winding among hills of various forms, and covered with woods, which &s;ometimes ad|vance boldly on projecting knolls; and &s;ome|times
<PB N="289" REF="318">
retire in bays and rece&s;&s;es. We heard al&s;o the ruins of the abbey-church commended, as remains of the pure&s;t Gothic. All the&s;e materials are in a high degree picture&s;que; and if they are happily united, Milton-abbey mu&s;t be a very intere&s;ting &s;cene. To make a good picture, compo&s;ition, however, is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary as plea&s;ing objects.</P>

<P>BLANDFORD, our next &s;tage, lies about &s;ixteen miles from Dorche&s;ter; and, though not a place of &s;uch renowned antiquity, is perhaps a &s;till more agreeable town. It lies within a curve of the river Stour, and is plea|&s;antly &s;eated among meadows and woods. If a per&s;on wi&s;hed to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s, where he might have the conveniences and plea&s;ures of the town and country united, his choice might waver between Barn&s;taple, Dorche&s;ter, and Blandford. If he wi&s;hed to be near the &s;ea, he will find a plea&s;ant &s;ea-coa&s;t at Barn|&s;taple. If airy downs, and open country plea&s;ed him, he might fix at Dorche&s;ter. But if he loved meadows and woodlands, he mu&s;t make choice of Blandford.</P>
<P>This town has been twice burnt almo&s;t within the memory of man. The la&s;t fire, which was in the year 1731, de&s;troyed it &s;o completely, that only twenty-&s;ix hou&s;es re|mained &s;tanding. Here we cannot help be|moaning the &s;ingular fate of the&s;e we&s;tern
<PB N="291" REF="320">
towns. This is the fourth of them we met with, (Dorche&s;ter, Crediton, and Honiton were the other three,) which have been totally, in a manner, de&s;troyed by fire. To the&s;e might be added Wareham, and very lately Mine|head.</P>
<P>Near Blandford &s;tands Ea&s;tbury, the &s;eat of Lord Melcombe; but it did not much attract our curio&s;ity; as it is more celebrated for the &s;plendor of the hou&s;e than the &s;cenery around it.</P>
<P>Brian&s;ton, Mr. Portman's &s;eat, which is near the town, I &s;uppo&s;e, is a much more plea&s;ing place. We were not at his hou&s;e; but &s;aw enough of his woody hill, and the variety both of its &s;teep and ea&s;y &s;lopes, together with the vale and winding river, over which it hangs, to regret the clo&s;ing in of the evening upon us, before we had fini&s;hed our walk.</P>
<P>From Blandford the country &s;till continues wild and uncultivated, yet full of antiquities; among which the mo&s;t celebrated is the found|ation
<PB N="292" REF="321">
of a &s;ort, called <HI>Badbury-ring.</HI> It makes a con&s;iderable figure, as we rode pa&s;t; and &s;eems from its elevation, its dimen&s;ions, and complicated works (for it has been fortified with a triple ditch) to have been a place of un|common &s;trength.</P>
<P>Some parts of the&s;e downs are very pictu|re&s;que. They are finely &s;pread, and form ele|gant &s;weeps, with many plea&s;ant views into a woody country, which &s;tretches away to the right. They po&s;&s;e&s;s indeed all the variety taken notice of by the poet, when he &s;peaks of the
<Q><L>&mdash; pure Dor&s;etian downs</L>
<L>In boundle&s;s pro&s;pect &s;pread; here &s;hagged with woods,</L>
<L>There rich with harve&s;ts, and there white with flocks.</L></Q>
In the la&s;t epithet he is rather unhappy; for the &s;heep, which graze the&s;e plains, are &s;o far from being <HI>white,</HI> that they are univer&s;ally wa&s;hed all over with <HI>red-ocre,</HI> which greatly injures both the pa&s;toral and picture&s;que idea.</P>
<P>Winborn was our next &s;tage from Bland|ford; appearing, as we approach it, to &s;tand in a wild vale &s;urrounded with wood. This town takes its name from one of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated
<PB N="293" REF="322">
abbies of Saxon times. Its form dates its antiquity. The great church, which is the only part remaining, is of the heavie&s;t and earlie&s;t &s;pecies of Saxon architecture. If it have no beauty, however, it hath at lea&s;t the peculiarity of two contiguous and &s;imilar towers; on one of which &s;tood once a &s;pire, equal in height, it is &s;aid, to that of Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P>In this church re&s;ts a large collection of royal and noble bones; but the tomb mo&s;t vi|&s;ited is that of King Ethelred, (brother to Al|fred the Great,) an excellent prince, ju&s;t &s;hewn to his &s;ubjects. In his early youth he engaged in all the toils and perplexities of government. The times were adver&s;e. His country was over|run by the Danes. He encountered them in bat|tle, and was mortally wounded. His remains were depo&s;ited in the chancel of this church, where the in&s;cription upon his grave-&s;tone, one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, hath been occa&s;ionally re|paired, or it could never have endured the changes of &s;o many hundred years. His effi|gies too, in &s;culptured bra&s;s, though of mi&s;erable workman&s;hip, is, however, better than we can &s;uppo&s;e the times of Alfred could produce. In a life &s;o &s;hort there was little to record, but the la&s;t great &s;cene of it.
<Q><PB N="294" REF="323">S: ETHELREDI, REGIS WEST SAX|ONUM, MARTYRIS, QUI ANNO DOMI|NI DCCCLXXII, XXIII APRILIS, PER MANUS DANORUM PAGANORUM, OC|CUBUIT.</Q>
The whole monument has a monki&s;h air, and was probably the production of later times than tho&s;e of Alfred. Mr. Gough, in his &s;plen|did publication on &s;epulchral antiquities, &s;up|po&s;es from the form of the letters, that this in|&s;cription is not older than the times of the Re|formation, which is perhaps bringing it as much too low, as other people are inclined to carry it too high.</P>
<P>From Winborn we pa&s;&s;ed through a heathy, barren, flat, unplea&s;ant country to Pool, which lies about nine miles farther. This country, unplea&s;ant as it is, is rendered more &s;o as we approach the town. The whole coa&s;t is oozy, and when the tide ebbs, it has the ap|pearance of a va&s;t &s;wamp, with which the heathy flat before us unites in one level &s;ur|face. Nothing, under the idea of land&s;cape, can be more di&s;agreeable. When the tide flows, the view is &s;omewhat mended. The
<PB N="295" REF="324">
water covering the &s;wamp gives &s;ome variety to the &s;urface of a dead unintere&s;ting flat.</P>
<P>Beyond the water appear the high lands of <HI>the i&s;le</HI> of Purbeck, as it is called; though it is, in fact, only a va&s;t promontory running eight or nine miles in the form of a penin&s;ula along the coa&s;t. It is wa&s;hed by the river Frome on one &s;ide, and by the &s;ea on the other. Here are dug great quantities of that hard &s;pecies of &s;tone, which takes the name of the country, and is of &s;uch excellent u&s;e in paving. Here too are found marbles more beautiful than the marbles of Italy; but le&s;s valued, becau&s;e more common. They are &s;omething like the marbles we admired at Ply|mouth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 203.</NOTE>; but I think more variegated. The veins, running on a brown ground, are white, red, and blue.</P>
<P>Seated high on one of the eminences of Purbeck, far to the we&s;t, we &s;aw Corff-ca&s;tle; but the di&s;tance was too great to di&s;tingui&s;h its features clearly. The ruins of it are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the kind in Eng|land. It was reduced to this &s;tate by the par|liament at the conclu&s;ion of the civil wars.
<PB N="296" REF="325">
Va&s;t piles of ruin were thrown down into the ditch; but the immen&s;e ma&s;&s;ine&s;s of them, and the tenacity of the mortar, will long pre&s;erve them from any farther &s;eparation. The prin|cipal facts commemorated in this celebrated ca&s;tle, are the murder of Edward the Martyr, by Elfrida; the impri&s;onment of Edward the Second, till he was carried to his la&s;t horrid confinement at Berkly-ca&s;tle; and the long &s;iege it underwent in the civil wars of Charles I. defended by Lady Banks (wife of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Banks, to whom it belonged) with a garri&s;on only of forty men, again&s;t an army with artillery.</P>
<P>In the king's library in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. 18. D. III.</NOTE>, are a &s;et of maps of the &s;everal counties of England, which belonged to the old Lord Bur|leigh; and are rendered curious by &s;everal of his notes and memoranda written upon their margins. To the i&s;land of Purbeck he &s;eems to have paid great attention. His notes upon it probably have a reference to the Spani&s;h in|va&s;ion. We are not to expect any picture&s;que remarks from Lord Burleigh: but his ob&s;erv|ations give us <HI>an idea of the coa&s;t.</HI> <Q>At Stud|land-bay
<PB N="297" REF="326">
he ob&s;erves that forty boats may land, but not without danger. At Swanage, boats may land, and retreat at any time of the tide. In this bay and Studland-bay, &s;ix or &s;even hundred &s;hips, of a thou&s;and ton burden, may ride &s;afe in any wind. Along this coa&s;t, for three miles, there is a good landing. Shipman's-pool is a creek, where the enemy cannot land more than two or three boats. Batterage-bay is full of rocks and &s;helves. Such al&s;o are Worbarrow-bay, Are&s;tmi&s;s, and Lullworth-cove. But in Worbarrow-bay, and Shipman's-pool, five hundred &s;ail of large &s;hips may ride in al|mo&s;t every wind.</Q></P>
<P>Pool lies on a bay of the &s;ea, which is very intricate. The body of it is a large and com|modious harbour; but it runs into many little creeks and winding channels, which give it the air of a water-labyrinth. When the tide flows, the town appears encircled with water, and looks like Venice. But the &s;hores are &s;o low, e&s;pecially about Brown-i&s;land, (which appears only like a bank,) that there is little picture&s;que &s;cenery about the place. In &s;ome parts, when the tide is full, and you can get a few trees into the view, you have a tolerable Dutch

land&s;cape. In general, however, all is bare; and that painter only, who can &s;kilfully fill his foreground with figures, and marine append|ages, can make a picture of it. But few paint|ers have the art of touching &s;mall figures in land&s;cape; though many have the misfortune to &s;poil their pictures by attempting it. The <HI>general proportions</HI> even of &s;mall figures, and their graceful actions, (for there is a &s;pecies of <HI>picture&s;que grace,</HI> of which even <HI>clowns</HI> &s;hould participate,) are very hard to hit. We judge of the difficulty from the few who have ex|celled. Scot, who under&s;tood the form of a &s;hip, and in his &s;ea-views could give his &s;kies and water, not indeed the brilliancy of Van|derveld, yet a clearne&s;s, which every one could not attain, was very deficient in the nece&s;&s;ary addition of figures. He could not place their heads on their &s;houlders, nor hang on their arms, nor &s;et them on their legs, nor give them an ea&s;y action. And yet a few touches will do all this&mdash;it is &s;urpri&s;ing how few&mdash;when tho&s;e touches are well under&s;tood. Vander|veld could do it: Zeeman could do it; and yet, perhaps, neither of the&s;e ma&s;ters under|&s;tood the anatomy of the human body. Nei|ther of them, perhaps, could have drawn either
<PB N="299" REF="328">
a leg or an arm with accuracy. But in draw|ing a &s;mall figure for a land&s;cape, accuracy is not required; it is enough to under&s;tand its <HI>ge|neral proportion,</HI> the <HI>&s;ymmetry of its parts,</HI> and the <HI>effect of action.</HI> To under&s;tand the <HI>effect of action</HI> is &s;o exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary, that nothing hurts the eye more, than to &s;ee a figure awk|wardly u&s;ing its arms and legs. Almo&s;t any eye can &s;ee the impropriety. In the manage|ment of &s;mall figures, I mentioned Callot (two of who&s;e pictures we had &s;een at Longford-ca&s;tle) among the mo&s;t able ma&s;ters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 73.</NOTE>. They who have not an opportunity of &s;eeing his pictures, which are &s;carce, may ob&s;erve the &s;ame &s;kill in his prints; and yet I &s;hould not care to mention this ma&s;ter as a perfect model; becau&s;e, with all his excellence, there is often a degree of affectation in his attitudes. If his figures had been large, the eye would have taken quick di&s;gu&s;t; but in a miniature, the ex|aggeration of po&s;ture is le&s;s &s;triking.</P>
<P>Our route from Pool to Chri&s;t-church led us over a heath, wilder almo&s;t than any we had
<PB N="300" REF="329">
yet found; but it &s;carcely la&s;ted four miles. It ended in agreeable lanes, through a country not unplea&s;ant. At lea&s;t the force of contra&s;t with the country we had ju&s;t &s;een, gave it a plea&s;ant appearance. Here, whenever we had an opening on the right, we had views of the &s;ea, the I&s;le of Wight, and the Needles.</P>
<P>From Chri&s;t-church we proceeded to Ly|mington, &s;kirting the borders of New Fore&s;t. But as I have given an account of this coun|try in another work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fore&s;t Scenery.</NOTE>, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over here.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>AT Lymington we embarked for the I&s;le of Wight, and &s;tood for Cowes. As we ap|proached it, the &s;hore &s;oon began to form into two points of land; the nearer of which is de|fended by a &s;mall ca&s;tle; the farther &s;eemed high ground, and woody.</P>
<P>As we drew nearer, the bay began to open; and as we turned the ca&s;tle-point, an ample road, well &s;ecured, lay before us full of large &s;hipping. The town of Cowes occupied the two &s;ides of the hill on the right and left. The harbour is a creek, running a con&s;iderable way into the country. It is formed by the river Medina, which comes down from the higher grounds, where the i&s;land &s;wells into its greate&s;t breadth, and is navigable as far as Newport, about &s;ix miles from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>At Cows we landed, intending to &s;pend two or three days in the i&s;land, which we hoped would allow us &s;ufficient time to exa|mine its picture&s;que beauties.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="331">The form of the I&s;le of Wight is that of an irregular lozenge. From the ea&s;tern point to the we&s;tern, it ranges about twenty-three miles; from the northern to the &s;outhern about thir|teen. Through the middle of it, in the longer direction, runs a track of high land, in &s;ome parts rather mountainous, but of the &s;mooth downy kind, fit for the pa&s;turage of &s;heep. From the&s;e high grounds we have every where a view of the i&s;land, and its boundaries, of the &s;ea towards the &s;outh, and towards the north of the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire, from which the i&s;land is &s;eparated by a channel about five or &s;ix miles in breadth.</P>
<P>The &s;hores of the i&s;land on the northern &s;ide fall almo&s;t every where to the water in ea&s;y declivities; except ju&s;t at the we&s;tern, or Needle point, where they are broken and pre|cipitous. But all the <HI>back of the i&s;land,</HI> (as the &s;outhern coa&s;t is commonly called,) which is wa&s;hed by the tides of the ocean, is worn bare to the naked rock, and is in mo&s;t places bounded again&s;t the &s;ea by &s;teep cliffs. What depredation the waves, in a cour&s;e of years, have made upon it, is evident from the frag|ments of rock which have tumbled from the undermined cliffs, and lie &s;cattered along the
<PB N="303" REF="332">
&s;hore. Many of them are far out at &s;ea; and at low water only, &s;hew their heads above the waves. No part of the Briti&s;h coa&s;t is more dangerous to ve&s;&s;els ungoverned, and driving in the &s;torm.</P>
<P>From Cowes our road led us fir&s;t to New|port, along the cour&s;e of the Medina; which afforded many happy &s;ituations to tho&s;e who are fortunate enough to have any of its more plea&s;ing reaches within the view of their hou&s;es. A tide river has always its di&s;advan|tages; but it has its advantages al&s;o. It is ge|nerally once or twice a day adorned with the white &s;ails of little &s;kiffs pa&s;&s;ing to and fro; and at all times with boats or anchoring-barks, which have lo&s;t the tide, and wait for its re|turn. The&s;e are picture&s;que circum&s;tances, which an inland river cannot have.</P>
<P>Newport is the capital town in the i&s;land. It grew into repute from its &s;ituation on the Medina, after Cari&s;broke, the natural capital, was de&s;erted. It is a large hand&s;ome town; and its market is often a curio&s;ity. As the i&s;land is &s;o fertile, that it is &s;uppo&s;ed to produce &s;even or eight times more grain than
<PB N="304" REF="333">
its inhabitants con&s;ume, the overplus is com|monly brought to Newport to be &s;hipped off, and an hundred laden waggons may &s;ometimes be &s;een ranged in double lines along the mar|ket-place. The free-&s;chool al&s;o, which is a hand&s;ome room, about fifty feet long, is worth looking into, as it received greater honour than perhaps any &s;chool-room ever did before. When the commi&s;&s;ioners from the Parliament treated with King Charles I. in the I&s;le of Wight, this room was cho&s;en for the confer|ence.</P>
<P>From Newport we propo&s;ed to take a view of the northern coa&s;t, which extends from Cowes-point to St. Helen's, and is thought to contain the mo&s;t beautiful part of the i&s;land. This might be done in two ways; either by riding along the coa&s;t, and &s;eeing each <HI>par|ticular</HI> place that was pointed out as mo&s;t beau|tiful; or by keeping along the higher grounds, and taking a <HI>general</HI> view of the whole toge|ther. As we could not do both, we cho&s;e the latter, and &s;oon found we had made the more judicious choice: for the ground quickly nar|rows in that part of the i&s;land; and we ob|tained
<PB N="305" REF="334">
a good idea of its <HI>general &s;cenery.</HI> Mr. Gro&s;e's hou&s;e at the Priory, and two or three other places, we could have wi&s;hed to have examined more particularly; but as we &s;hould have been confined within hedges, we could have &s;een little <HI>be&s;ides the places we imme|diately vi&s;ited.</HI> Of the <HI>general appearance</HI> of the land&s;cape, on this &s;ide of the i&s;land, &s;ome account &s;hall be given at the conclu&s;ion of our circuit round it.</P>
<P>Part of the high grounds, over which we pa&s;&s;ed, is called A&s;hy-down. On the loftie&s;t &s;ummit of this ridge is placed a &s;ea-mark. When &s;hips are driven by the &s;torm &s;o near the &s;outhern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, as to lo&s;e &s;ight of this mark of &s;ecurity, little hope of &s;afety remains. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible for them to avoid the rocks.</P>
<P>As the high grounds began to decline, we verged towards the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, with an intention to take a view of its rocky boundaries. But we had not here the advan|tageous point of view, which we had on the other &s;ide. The rocky &s;hores, which we wi&s;hed to examine, can be &s;een no where properly, but from the &s;ea. We could only, therefore, get a view of them from &s;ome particular &s;tands,
<PB N="306" REF="335">
which commanded a lengthened reach of the coa&s;t; and &s;uch &s;tands occurred but &s;eldom.</P>
<P>From the high grounds we de&s;cended fir&s;t to Sandown-bay, which lies on the &s;outh coa&s;t, and is the only part on this &s;ide, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed an enemy could effect a landing. It is defended by a fort, which takes its name from the bay. But the rocks &s;oon commence, and continue the guardians of the coa&s;t, in an almo&s;t uninterrupted chain from this place to the very we&s;tern point of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Among the curious parts of this rocky &s;cenery, we were carried to <HI>Shanklin-chine,</HI> a va&s;t cha&s;m winding between two high promon|tories, more than a mile into the country. The cha&s;m opens to the &s;ea, upon a bed of pebbles; where generally a boat or two lie moored; and the fi&s;herman's hut &s;tands half way up the pre|cipice. Both &s;ides of the cha&s;m are adorned with rock, and both with wood; and it is in general a picture&s;que &s;cene: but it has not the beauty of the dells of a mountainous country, where the wood is commonly finer, and the rocks more adorned, and more maje&s;tic; and where a &s;tream, pouring over ledges of rock,
<PB N="307" REF="336">
or falling down a ca&s;cade, adds the melody of &s;ound, to the beauty of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Near Shanklin-chine, Mr. Stanley built a cottage among the rocks, where he enjoyed the &s;ea-breezes in the heat of &s;ummer. It is called <HI>Undercliff,</HI> as it is built on a ledge of rock be|tween the upper-cliffs and the &s;ea. The view in front is not unplea&s;ing. It is a &s;ort of wild rocky valley, about half a quarter of a mile acro&s;s, hanging over the &s;ea; which ap|pears abruptly beyond it, without the interven|tion of any middle ground. It exhibits gene|rally a moving picture, pre&s;enting the track which &s;hips, coa&s;ting the i&s;land, commonly take.</P>
<P>As it is a <HI>bird's-eye</HI> view, many of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially of the &s;maller &s;ize, appear with their ma&s;ts and &s;ails con&s;iderably <HI>below the horizon.</HI> I mention this circum&s;tance, be|cau&s;e in a picture &s;uch repre&s;entations are ra|ther unplea&s;ing. In repre&s;enting a view of this kind, therefore, the painter (if under a nece&s;&s;ity to paint it) &s;hould always wi&s;h to re|move the ve&s;&s;els he introduces &s;o far into di&s;|tance, as to rai&s;e their ma&s;ts above the hori|zon
<PB N="308" REF="337">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this &s;ubject treated more at large in the Fore&s;t Scenery, vol. ii. p. 115.</NOTE>. The larger the ve&s;&s;el is, the nearer of cour&s;e &s;he may approach the eye. In the <HI>va|riety and motion of natural views,</HI> we are not &s;o much hurt with the&s;e circum&s;tances, which have a bad effect in painting; and yet a <HI>bird's-eye</HI> view <HI>on water,</HI> is always le&s;s plea&s;ing than <HI>on land;</HI> as the variety of ground is more amu&s;ing in it&s;elf than water, and as it carries off the per&s;pective better. The <HI>grandeur,</HI> which an <HI>exten&s;ive view of the ocean</HI> pre&s;ents, is a differ|ent idea: we are &s;peaking here only of its <HI>beauty.</HI> If we re&s;trict the ma&s;ts of &s;hips, how|ever, from appearing <HI>below the horizon,</HI> we object not to boats and birds in that &s;ituation. The boat either fi&s;hing or in motion, the wheeling gull, or the lengthened file of &s;ea-fowl, appear often to great advantage <HI>again&s;t the bo&s;om of the &s;ea;</HI> and being marked with a few &s;trong touches, contribute to throw the ocean into per&s;pective.</P>
<P>But though the <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of <HI>Undercliff</HI> or <HI>Steephill</HI> is plea&s;ing, we could not &s;ay much for what is called the <HI>cottage.</HI> It is covered indeed with thatch; but that makes it no more a cot|tage,
<PB N="309" REF="338">
than ruffles would make a clown a gen|tleman, or a meally hat would turn a laced beau into a miller. We every where &s;ee the appen|dages of junket and good living. Who would expect to find a fountain bubbling up under the windows of a <HI>cottage,</HI> into an elegant carved &s;hell to cool wine? The thing is beautiful; but out of place. The imagination does not like to be jolted in its &s;en&s;ations from one idea to another; but to go on quietly in the &s;ame track, either of <HI>grandeur</HI> or <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> Ea&s;y contra&s;ts it approves; but violent interruptions it di&s;likes.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ing ideas, no doubt, may be executed under the form of a cottage; but to make them <HI>plea&s;ing,</HI> they &s;hould be <HI>harmonious.</HI> We &s;ome|times &s;ee the <HI>cottage idea</HI> carried &s;o far, as to pa&s;te ballads on the walls with good effect. But we need not re&s;trict what may be called the <HI>artificial cottage</HI> to &s;o very clo&s;e an imi|tation of the <HI>natural one.</HI> In the <HI>in&s;ide</HI> cer|tainly it may admit much greater neatne&s;s and convenience; though even here every orna|ment that approaches <HI>&s;plendor,</HI> &s;hould be re|jected. Without too, though the roof be thatched, we may allow it to cover two &s;tories;
<PB N="310" REF="339">
and if it project &s;omewhat over the walls, the effect may be better. We &s;hould not object to &s;a&s;hed windows; but they mu&s;t not be large; and if you wi&s;h for a ve&s;tibule, a common brick porch, with a plain neat roof, is all we allow. We often &s;ee the front of a cottage covered with what is called <HI>rough ca&s;t;</HI> which has a good effect; and this may be tinted with a yellowi&s;h tinge mixed with lime, which is more plea&s;ing than the cold raw tint of lime and a&s;hes. But if in the front there is any &s;tonework, under the denomination of frize, archetrave, or ornament of any kind, it is too much.</P>
<P>The ground about a cottage &s;hould be neat, but artle&s;s. There is no occa&s;ion to plant cab|bages in the front. The garden may be re|moved out of &s;ight; but the lawn that comes up to the door, &s;hould be grazed, rather than mown. The &s;unk-fence, the net, and the painted rail, are ideas alien to the cottage. The broad gravel walk too we totally reject; and in its room wi&s;h only for a &s;imple unaf|fected one.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being con&s;idered, it may, per|haps, be a more difficult thing to rear a cottage,
<PB N="311" REF="340">
with all its proper uniformities, than is com|monly imagined; ina&s;much as it may be ea&s;ier to introduce the elegances of art, than to catch the pure &s;implicity of nature.</P>
<P>From Steephill we vi&s;ited a &s;cene of a very different kind, Sir Richard Wor&s;ley's &s;eat at Appuldercomb. Here every thing was <HI>uni|formly grand.</HI> The hou&s;e is magnificent, and it is magnificently furni&s;hed. Enriched ceilings, a few good pictures, co&s;tly hangings, &s;hewy carpets, Gobelin chairs, and large pier-gla&s;&s;es, all corre&s;pond; and yet not in any expen&s;ive profu&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this has been written, I am told, the hou&s;e is adorned with &s;ome curious pieces of Greek antiquities.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The grounds too, which were more the objects of our curio&s;ity, are laid out in a &s;tile of greatne&s;s equal to the man&s;ion. A woody &s;cene ri&s;ing behind, is a beautiful back-ground to the hou&s;e, as well as an excellent &s;helter from the north. In front is &s;pread a magnifi|cent lawn, or rather a park, (for it is furni&s;hed with deer,) well varied, and not ill-planted, &s;tretching far and wide. Its boundary, in one
<PB N="312" REF="341">
part, is confined, at the di&s;tance of about two miles, by a hill running out like a promon|tory; who&s;e continuous horizontal ridge might hurt the eye, if it were not crowned with a ca&s;tle. This object &s;eems well executed, and is certainly well placed. Views of the &s;ea, and various parts of the i&s;land, are judiciou&s;ly opened from all the higher grounds about the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>FROM this &s;cene of magnificence in &s;plen|dor, we vi&s;ited another of magnificence in ruin. This was Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle, an object perhaps the be&s;t worth &s;eeing of any in the i&s;land. In&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing on therefore to the Needle-cliffs, which remained yet un&s;een, we returned to Newport, which lies within a &s;hort walk of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle &s;tands on elevated ground, nearly in the centre of the i&s;land. It is a for|tre&s;s of great antiquity. Its towers and battle|ments have been the care of &s;everal princes through a long &s;eries of years; and we ea&s;ily mark the &s;tyle of different ages, not only from the dates, and arms, which are placed in vari|ous parts of the ca&s;tle, but al&s;o in the mode of building. Its late&s;t works have the air of mo|dern fortification. They are con&s;tructed of earth, faced with &s;tone, and are carried round the ca&s;tle as an outwork; forming a circum|ference of about a mile and a half. What is properly called the ca&s;tle, &s;tands on &s;omewhat
<PB N="314" REF="344">
le&s;s than two acres of land. It is difficult on the &s;pot to <HI>comprehend</HI> the various parts of this complicated fortre&s;s; to <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> it would be impo&s;&s;ible. Some of the more remarkable parts are commonly &s;hewn. We were carried to &s;ee Montjoy's tower; the walls of which are eighteen feet thick. We were conducted al&s;o to the top of the Keep; from whence we di&s;covered the &s;ea in the three directions of north, &s;outh, and ea&s;t. On the we&s;t, a hill in|tercepted it. We were &s;hewn al&s;o a well as curious for its <HI>depth,</HI> as the Keep is for its <HI>height;</HI> and were de&s;ired to li&s;ten to the echoes and <HI>lengthened &s;ound,</HI> which even a pin makes when thrown into it. There lived lately an appendage to this well, which de&s;erved notice al&s;o. It was an a&s;s, which had drawn water patiently from it, through the &s;pace of forty years.</P>
<P>Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle was once the re&s;idence of the princes of the country; and afterwards of appointed governors, when the i&s;land became annexed to the crown. As the inhabitants had not that ready acce&s;s to ju&s;tice, which other parts of the kingdom had, they &s;ometimes &s;marted under the de&s;potic power of their go|vernors. Remon&s;trances were often made to
<PB N="315" REF="345">
the crown; but it &s;eems to have been a maxim of &s;tate, e&s;pecially during the reign of the Tudors, to &s;trengthen, rather than abridge the power of governors in the remoter provinces; and though it was not always a maxim of ju&s;|tice, it was probably a maxim of good policy. On the borders of Scotland we have many in|&s;tances of this delegated tyranny.</P>
<P>But though the governors of the i&s;land were &s;ometimes apt to over-rule law them&s;elves; they were careful not to let the inhabitants feel vexations of any law, but their own. For this rea&s;on they would never &s;uffer an at|torney to &s;ettle in the i&s;land. In the Oglander family are pre&s;erved &s;ome memoirs of the country, written by Sir John Oglander, one of their ance&s;tors, in which we are told, that in the reign of Elizabeth, when Sir George Cary was governor of the i&s;land, an attorney came &s;neaking into it, with a view to &s;ettle. Sir George hearing of him had him apprehended; and ordering bells to be fa&s;tened about his legs, and a lighted firebrand tied to his back, he turned him loo&s;e to the populace, who hunted him out of the i&s;land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sir R. Wor&s;ley's Account of the I&s;le of Wight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="346">Adjoining to Cari&s;broke ca&s;tle is a royal domain, called Parkhur&s;t, or Cari&s;broke-fore&s;t. It contains about three thou&s;and acres; and mu&s;t have been, when its woods were lux|uriant, very beautiful. It is now a naked &s;cene; but we &s;aw its elegant lines with more advan|tage, than if it had been adorned with all its &s;ylvan drapery. The deer, its ancient inhabit|ants, are now nearly extinct; and it is grazed by &s;heep, and little groups of wild hor&s;es, which are not le&s;s ornamental.</P>
<P>The great hi&s;torical circum&s;tance of Cari&s;|broke-ca&s;tle, is its having been long the pri&s;on of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed maje&s;ty. Many a mournful tale on this &s;ubject, the noble hi&s;torian of tho&s;e times hath told us. He is circum&s;tantial in his relation of the unhappy Charles's impri&s;on|ment here. But in an account of the I&s;le of Wight, collected by an ance&s;tor of the Wor&s;ley-family, and printed, though in few hands, &s;ome circum&s;tances with regard to that event are mentioned, which had not come to the ears of Lord Clarendon.</P>
<P>That hi&s;torian tells us, through what means this unfortunate prince threw him&s;elf into the power of Colonel Hammond, who was then governor of the I&s;le of Wight. Ham|mond,
<PB N="317" REF="347">
however, &s;eems to have been a man of humanity; and while his hands were untied, was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew the king every civility in his power. Charles took his exerci&s;e on hor&s;e|back, where he plea&s;ed; though his motions were probably ob&s;erved; and, as the parliament had granted him five thou&s;and pounds a year, he lived a few months in &s;omething like royal &s;tate.</P>
<P>But this liberty was &s;oon abridged: his chaplains and &s;ervants were fir&s;t taken from him; then his going abroad in the i&s;land gave offence; and &s;oon after, his intercour&s;e with any body, but tho&s;e &s;et about him. So &s;oli|tary were his hours, during a great part of his confinement, that as he was one day &s;tanding near the gate of the ca&s;tle, with Sir Philip Warwick, he pointed to an old decrepid man walking acro&s;s one of the courts, and &s;aid, that man is &s;ent every morning to light my fire; and is the be&s;t companion I have had for many months.</P>
<P>All this &s;evere u&s;age Charles bore with pa|tience and equanimity, and endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to keep his mind employed. He had ever been impre&s;&s;ed with &s;erious thoughts of religion, which his misfortunes had
<PB N="318" REF="348">
now &s;trengthened and confirmed. Devotion, meditation, and reading the &s;criptures, were his great con&s;olation. The few books he had brought with him into the ca&s;tle, were chiefly on religious &s;ubjects; or of a &s;erious ca&s;t. Among them was Hooker's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity. This book, it is probable, he had &s;tudied with great attention; as it related much to the na|tional que&s;tions of that time, in which no man was better ver&s;ed. In his &s;lender catalogue we find al&s;o two books of amu&s;ement, Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem, and Spencer's Fairy Queen. If Charles had <HI>acted</HI> with as much judgment as he <HI>read,</HI> and had &s;hewn as much <HI>di&s;cernment in life,</HI> as he had <HI>ta&s;te in the arts,</HI> he might have figured among the greate&s;t princes. Every lover of picture&s;que beauty, however, mu&s;t re|&s;pect this amiable prince, notwith&s;tanding his political weakne&s;&s;es. We never had a prince in England, who&s;e genius and ta&s;te were more elevated and exact. He &s;aw the arts in a very enlarged point of view. The amu&s;ements of his court were a model of elegance to all Eu|rope; and his cabinets were the receptacles only of what was exqui&s;ite in &s;culpture and painting. None but men of the fir&s;t merit in their profe&s;&s;ion found encouragement from
<PB N="319" REF="349">
him; and the&s;e abundantly. Jones was his architect, and Vandyck his painter. Charles was a &s;cholar, a man of ta&s;te, a gentleman, and a chri&s;tian; he was every thing but a king. The <HI>art of reigning</HI> was the <HI>only art</HI> of which he was ignorant.</P>
<P>But though a love for the arts, we &s;ee, has no connection with <HI>political wi&s;dom;</HI> yet we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily give up its tendency to <HI>melio|rate the heart.</HI> This effect we may <HI>pre&s;ume at lea&s;t</HI> it had on Charles.</P>
<P>To this &s;uppo&s;ition in favor of the arts, it is objected, that we often &s;ee among profe&s;&s;ional men very abandoned libertines. But I &s;hould here wi&s;h to &s;ugge&s;t a di&s;tinction between an <HI>innate love for what is beautiful,</HI> and that &s;ort of <HI>mechanical turn,</HI> which can happily delineate, colour, and expre&s;s, an object of beauty. The one is &s;eated in the <HI>heart,</HI> and the other in the <HI>eye and in the fingers.</HI> The <HI>mechanical man,</HI> merely following his profe&s;&s;ion, is governed by no idea, but that of enriching him&s;elf. It is not the love of beauty with which he is &s;mitten, but the love of money. He paints a picture with as little enthu&s;ia&s;m, as a black&s;mith &s;hoes a hor&s;e. All this is &s;ordid. Whereas the true admirer of art feels his mind thoroughly
<PB N="320" REF="350">
impre&s;&s;ed with the <HI>love of beauty.</HI> He is tran&s;|ported with it in nature; and he admires it in art, the &s;ub&s;titute of nature. The love of beauty may exi&s;t without a hand to execute the images it excites. It may exi&s;t the more &s;trongly perhaps for being only <HI>felt;</HI> for the conceptions of genius never ri&s;e in value from their being embodied. The <HI>embodied form</HI> is always below the <HI>original idea.</HI></P>
<P>The beauteous forms of nature and art thus impre&s;&s;ed on the mind, give it a di&s;po&s;ition to happine&s;s, from the habit of being plea&s;ed, from the habit of &s;eeking always for plea&s;ing objects, and making even di&s;plea&s;ing objects agreeable by throwing on them &s;uch colours of imagi|nation, as improve their defects; and if a <HI>love for beauty</HI> is not immediately connected with <HI>moral</HI> ideas, we may at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;oftens the mind, and puts it in a frame to receive them. <Q>An intimate acquaintance with the works of art and genius, in their mo&s;t beautiful and amiable forms, (&s;ays an agreeable writer,) harmonizes and &s;weetens the temper, opens and extends the imagin|ation, and di&s;po&s;es to the mo&s;t plea&s;ing views of mankind and Providence. By con|&s;idering nature in this favourable point of
<PB N="321" REF="351">
view, the heart is dilated, and filled with the mo&s;t benevolent &s;entiments: and then indeed the &s;ecret &s;ympathy and connection between the feelings of natural and moral beauty, the connection between a good ta&s;te and a good heart, appears with the greate&s;t lu&s;tre <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gregory's Compar. View, p. 236.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>We left the unhappy Charles, who occa|&s;ioned the&s;e remarks, in one of the gloomy man&s;ions of Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle, amu&s;ing his &s;o|litary hours with Hooker's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, and Spencer's Fairy Queen. His exerci&s;e was now much abridged. He was &s;killed in hor&s;e|man&s;hip, and fond of riding. But as this was refu&s;ed, he &s;pent two or three hours every morning in walking on the ramparts of the ca&s;tle. Here he enjoyed at lea&s;t a fine air, and an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect; though every object he &s;aw, the flocks &s;traying carele&s;sly on one &s;ide, and the &s;hips &s;ailing freely on the other, put him in mind of that liberty, of which he was &s;o cruelly deprived.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he was totally carele&s;s of his per&s;on. He let his beard and his hair grow, and was inattentive to his dre&s;s. <Q>They
<PB N="322" REF="352">
who had &s;een him,</Q> (&s;ays Lord Clarendon) <Q>a year before, thought his countenance ex|tremely altered; his hair was grey, and his appearance very different from what it had been.</Q></P>
<P>There is a picture of him at Sion-hou&s;e, in which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his mind are &s;trongly characteri&s;ed on his countenance. A per&s;on is repre&s;ented delivering him a letter, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain bad news. Charles's features were always compo&s;ed and &s;erious; but here they are heightened with a melancholy air, and yet they are marked al&s;o with mildne&s;s and fortitude. It is a very affecting picture, as it brings &s;trongly before us the feelings of this amiable prince, on the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous events of his life. It is painted &s;o much in the manner of Vandyck, that it might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for one of his be&s;t pictures. But it was cer|tainly painted by Sir Peter Lely, who copied after Vandyck, when he fir&s;t came into Eng|land. Vandyck died in the year 1641, which was before the troubles of Charles began.</P>
<P>During the time of his impri&s;onment in Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle, three attempts were made, chiefly by the gentlemen of the i&s;land, to re&s;|cue him. Lord Clarendon gives us the detail
<PB N="323" REF="353">
of two of them; but a third, which he had heard of, he &s;uppo&s;es to have been a mere fiction. As it is mentioned, however, in the Wor&s;ley papers, with every mark of authen|ticity, and as one of the principal conductors of it was a gentleman of that family, there &s;eems to be little doubt of its being a fact. The following is an ab&s;tract of it.</P>
<P>By a corre&s;pondence privately &s;ettled with &s;ome gentlemen in the i&s;land, it was agreed, that the king &s;hould let him&s;elf down by a cord from a window in his apartment. A &s;wift hor&s;e, with a guide, were to wait for him at the bottom of the ramparts; and a ve&s;&s;el in the offing was to be ready to convey him where he plea&s;ed. The chief difficulty in the &s;cheme was in the fir&s;t &s;tep. The a&s;&s;ociating gentlemen were doubtful how the king &s;hould get through the iron bars of his window. But Charles a&s;&s;ured them, he had tried the pa&s;&s;age, and did not doubt but it was &s;ufficiently large. All things, therefore, were now prepared, the hour was come, and the &s;ecret &s;ign thrown up to the king's window. Charles being ready, began the attempt; but he &s;oon found he had made a fal&s;e calculation. Having protruded his head and &s;houlders, he could get no far|ther;
<PB N="324" REF="354">
and what was wor&s;e, having made great exertions thus far, he could not draw him&s;elf back. His friends at the bottom heard him groan in his di&s;tre&s;s, but were unable to relieve him. At length, however, by repeated efforts he got him&s;elf di&s;engaged; but made at that time no farther attempt. Afterwards he con|trived to &s;aw the bars of his window a&s;under; and another &s;cheme was laid; but the parti|culars of this, Lord Clarendon details.</P>
<P>The treaty at Newport &s;oon followed; after which Charles was &s;eized by the army, and carried a pri&s;oner to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle. In his way thither he met Mr. Wor&s;ley, one of the gentlemen who had ri&s;ked his life for him at Cari&s;broke. Charles wrung his hand with affection, and pulling his watch out of his pocket, gave it to him, &s;aying, <Q>That is all my gratitude has to give.</Q></P>
<P>This watch is &s;till pre&s;erved in the family. It is of &s;ilver, large and clum&s;y in its form. The ca&s;e is neatly ornamented with filagree; but the movements are of very ordinary work|man&s;hip, and wound up with catgut. I men|tion the&s;e particulars merely for the &s;ake of ob&s;erving, that the arts do not certainly troop in companies together &s;o much as they are
<PB N="325" REF="355">
often repre&s;ented. At the time when this clum&s;y piece of mechani&s;m was made, which we may &s;uppo&s;e was the work of the be&s;t arti&s;t of his day, architecture and painting were at a height, which they have never exceeded. The ca&s;e &s;eems to be this; when art has a model before it, (as painting has nature, and archi|tecture the Grecian orders,) it &s;oon arrives at perfection. But &s;uch arts as depend on inven|tion, &s;cience, and mechanic &s;kill, work their way but &s;lowly in a country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1793, on digging a grave in the church of New|port, a leaden coffin was found, with this in&s;cription: ELISA|BETH, 2^d DAUGHTER OF THE LATE KING CHARLES, DECEASED SEP 8^t^h, MDCL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it the we&s;tern parts of the i&s;land, and took our cour&s;e, as before, along the higher grounds, through the middle of the country. Our road led us near Swan&s;ton, the &s;eat of Sir Fitzwil|liam Barrington, which &s;eems to be a plea&s;ant &s;cene: and afterwards near We&s;tover-lodge, the habitation of Mr. Holmes, where we ob|&s;erved nothing very intere&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="356">A little &s;tream, which we cro&s;s here, falling down to the northern coa&s;t, forms at Newtown, a few miles below, one of the be&s;t natural har|bours in the i&s;land. The &s;treets and ve&s;tiges of a con&s;iderable town are here traced; but &s;carce a hou&s;e is &s;tanding. Whether it was planned and never built, or whether it was de|&s;troyed and never re&s;tored, &s;eems to be matter of uncertainty. It is the general opinion, that it was burnt in &s;ome Dani&s;h inva&s;ion. But its being repre&s;ented in parliament &s;eems rather to indicate its having had a period of later exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>From hence we proceeded to Yarmouth, where Henry VIII. built a ca&s;tle to defend the entrance through the Needles, between the I&s;le of Wight and the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire; on which coa&s;t &s;tands Hur&s;t, another ca&s;tle oppo&s;ite to that at Yarmouth.</P>
<P>Here the i&s;land draws nearly to a point. The extreme part of it is almo&s;t &s;eparated from the main body by a creek, which runs up from Yarmouth almo&s;t to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. The narrow i&s;thmus is called Fre&s;hwater-gate. Here

<P>WE had now taken a view of the i&s;land from one end to the other, and on the whole, found our&s;elves rather di&s;appointed in the chief object of our pur&s;uit, which was the picture&s;que beauty of its &s;cenery.</P>
<P><HI>Picture&s;que beauty</HI> is a phra&s;e but little un|der&s;tood. We preci&s;ely mean by it that kind of beauty which <HI>would look well in a picture.</HI> Neither grounds laid out by art, nor improved by agriculture, are of this kind. The I&s;le of Wight is, in fact, a large garden, or rather a field, which in every part has been disfigured by the &s;pade, the coulter, and the harrow. It abounds much more in tillage than in pa&s;tur|age; and of all &s;pecies of cultivation, corn-lands are the mo&s;t unpicture&s;que. The regula|rity of corn-fields di&s;gu&s;ts; and the colour of corn, e&s;pecially near harve&s;t, is out of tune with every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e <HI>manufactured &s;cenes</HI> are commonly thought to be <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> You rarely meet a de&s;cription of the beauties of the country, in
<PB N="329" REF="359">
which &s;ome of its <HI>artificial appendages</HI> do not make a part of the land&s;cape. And in <HI>poetry</HI> all the&s;e circum&s;tances appear with advan|tage:
<Q><L>Sometimes walking, not un&s;een,</L>
<L>By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green:</L>
<L>While the plowman, near at hand,</L>
<L>Whi&s;tles o'er the furrowed land;</L>
<L>And the milk-maid &s;inging blithe;</L>
<L>And the mower whets his &s;cithe.</L></Q>
But however plea&s;ing all this may be in poetry, on canva&s;s, hedge-row elms, furrowed lands, meadows adorned with milk-maids, and hay-fields adorned with mowers, have a bad effect.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the I&s;le of Wight in a pic|ture&s;que light, we divide it into three kinds of land&s;cape, the <HI>high grounds,</HI> the <HI>lower culti|vated parts,</HI> and the <HI>rocky &s;cenes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>high grounds,</HI> which, as we ju&s;t ob&s;erved, run from the ea&s;tern to the we&s;tern point, through the middle of the i&s;land, are the only parts of the country which are in a &s;tate of na|ture; and yet even the&s;e are not wholly &s;o: for large farms have, in many parts, made in|croachments upon them, and cut them into &s;quares by regular hedges, and inclo&s;ed &s;heep-walks. Sometimes, however, from the&s;e heights, we are able to obtain a &s;weep of coun|try
<PB N="330" REF="360">
unincumbered with the intru&s;ions of art. About Cari&s;broke-fore&s;t particularly, for many miles together, we &s;ee nothing like cultivation.</P>
<P>But &s;till the be&s;t of the&s;e views afford little more than what may be called <HI>exten&s;ive fore|grounds.</HI> Of <HI>di&s;tant country</HI> we meet with no|thing in a grand &s;tile, notwith&s;tanding our ele|vation. In &s;ome parts we find little dips from the higher grounds into woody bottoms, and in other parts di&s;tances of a few miles in extent over the country below, but nothing that is remote enough to a&s;&s;ume grandeur.</P>
<P>A di&s;tance mu&s;t &s;tretch away many leagues from the eye; it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of various <HI>inter|mediate parts;</HI> it mu&s;t be enriched by <HI>numerous objects,</HI> which lo&s;e by degrees all form and di&s;|tinctne&s;s; and finally perhaps <HI>terminate</HI> in faint purple mountains, or perhaps mix with the blue mi&s;ts of ether, before it can pretend to the character of <HI>grandeur.</HI> Such were the &s;cenes pre&s;ented to us from the heights of Pon|tic, and the hills of Quantoc <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 149 and 161.</NOTE>. But here we had nothing of this kind. A &s;canty i&s;land could not afford them. Sometimes indeed,
<PB N="331" REF="361">
when the foregrounds were happily di&s;po&s;ed with the &s;ea beyond them, we got a grand and &s;imple &s;ea-view, <HI>grander</HI> perhaps than the di&s;|tances I have ju&s;t been alluding to, as con&s;i&s;t|ing of <HI>fewer parts;</HI> but for that rea&s;on le&s;s <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>The northern coa&s;t between Cowes and St. Helen's is generally con&s;idered as the mo&s;t beautiful part of the i&s;land; and it pre&s;ents, no doubt, many lawns and woods, and a variety of ground, which mu&s;t be ever plea&s;ing: but &s;till we have only little, plea&s;ant, pa&s;toral &s;cenes; and the&s;e but &s;eldom in any per|fection; for as the whole country is under the di&s;cipline of cultivation, the picture&s;que eye is every where more or le&s;s offended.</P>
<P>To this may be added, that there is a great deficiency of wood. Though here and there a few plantations about improved &s;cenes, make a contra&s;t with the lawns they adorn; the country, in general is naked; and yet even &s;o late as in Charles II.'s time, there were woods in the i&s;land &s;o complete and exten&s;ive, that it is &s;aid a &s;quirrel might have travelled in &s;everal parts, many leagues together, on the tops of the trees. The&s;e woods, however, are now almo&s;t univer&s;ally cut down.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="362">But it is &s;aid, the i&s;land does not depend &s;o much on its <HI>home &s;cenery.</HI> Its views over the channel and the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t are its pride. The&s;e views, however, are far from being the mo&s;t beautiful of their kind, and much le&s;s beautiful than we had expected to find them. They want the great ingredients of a plea&s;ing <HI>coa&s;t view,</HI> a <HI>variety of line,</HI> and an <HI>extent of di&s;tance.</HI> Either of the&s;e ingredients would be a foundation for beauty; but here both are wanting.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, a <HI>variety of line</HI> is wanting. The line of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t runs generally in a &s;traight unbroken cour&s;e for many leagues. At lea&s;t it appears to deviate &s;o little from a &s;traight line, that the deviation is lo&s;t. Where|as the true beautiful <HI>coa&s;t line</HI> breaks away in various irregular curves, forming either grand rocky projections, or ample bays &s;weeping from the eye in winding per&s;pective. The&s;e ideas we had unhappily at this time &s;trong in recollection, having ju&s;t left the &s;hores of the Bri&s;tol channel, in which they abound. The compari&s;on gave additional tamene&s;s to the lines of the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="363">But an <HI>extent of country</HI> might have made &s;ome amends for the want of <HI>variety in the lines.</HI> We had, however, no more of this circum|&s;tance than of the other. The whole length of the coa&s;t pre&s;ents only a narrow edging of land. Whenever you hear the beauties of it mentioned, you always hear <HI>places named;</HI> but never a <HI>country de&s;cribed.</HI> You are never told, for in&s;tance, that the country forms &s;ome ample vale, with wooded hills winding on each &s;ide; or that the &s;cene at fir&s;t is woody, beyond which the country retires into remote di&s;tance. Nothing of this kind you hear; for nothing of this kind exi&s;ts. In&s;tead of this beautiful &s;cenery, you are informed, you may &s;ee Port&s;|mouth, and Go&s;port, and Lymington, and a number of other places, which lie near the &s;hore. And &s;o you may with a good gla&s;s; for it is the cu&s;tom of the i&s;land always to con|template land&s;cape through a tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>There are indeed times when views on this coa&s;t are grander than can be exhibited in any part of the world. When the navy of England is forming a rendezvous at Spithead, or waiting for a wind at St. Helen's, every curious per|&s;on, who loves a grand &s;ight, would wi&s;h for a &s;tand on the i&s;land-coa&s;t. And indeed the
<PB N="334" REF="364">
ea&s;tern end of it is generally entertained with &s;ome exhibition of this kind, even in time of peace; for though a fleet of thirty or forty &s;ail of the line is not continually riding near the coa&s;t, yet generally, either &s;ome &s;hips of war, or two or three frigates, are pa&s;&s;ing or re|pairing from Port&s;mouth-harbour, going out on a crui&s;e, or returning from one.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ights with which the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of the i&s;land are not often entertained. The tele&s;cope there is &s;eldom levelled at fleets, or &s;hips of the line. Sometimes a &s;olitary frigate, with a fair wind, or an Indiaman, may lead through the Needles, and attract the atten|tion of the we&s;tern i&s;landers; but on that &s;ide of the coa&s;t they mu&s;t generally be content with views adorned with &s;kiffs, pa&s;&s;age-boats, and fleets of whiting-fi&s;hers. If, however, they will be content to &s;ub&s;titute the <HI>picture&s;que</HI> in the room of the <HI>grand,</HI> they have in the&s;e minuter appendages the advantage of their ea&s;tern neighbours.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower</HI> grounds of the I&s;le of Wight, we con&s;ider la&s;tly its <HI>rocky &s;cenery.</HI> This is &s;eldom an ornament to
<PB N="335" REF="365">
the &s;cenes of the i&s;land, as it is &s;eldom &s;een from any part of it. Sometimes you may get a per|&s;pective view of a range of rocky-coa&s;t; but in general the rocks of the i&s;land make a &s;hew only at &s;ea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 306.</NOTE>; and there they are <HI>grand,</HI> rather than <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> Their <HI>height</HI> gives them gran|deur, &s;ome of them rearing them&s;elves &s;ix hundred feet above the level of the water. Their <HI>extent</HI> al&s;o is magnificent, as they range in &s;ome places perhaps a dozen miles along the coa&s;t. But their <HI>form</HI> and <HI>colour</HI> unite in in|juring their beauty.</P>
<P>With regard to their <HI>form,</HI> in&s;tead of pre|&s;enting tho&s;e noble ma&s;&s;es, and broad &s;ur|faces of projecting rocks, which we &s;ee along many of the coa&s;ts of England, they are broken and crumbled into minute parts. The chalky &s;ub&s;tance, of which they are con|&s;tructed, has not con&s;i&s;tence to &s;pread into an ample &s;urface. It &s;hivers too much. If I were to de&s;cribe the&s;e rocks therefore in two words, I &s;hould call them <HI>magnificently little.</HI> This, however, is a di&s;advantage only on the <HI>foreground. At &s;ea</HI> all the&s;e frittered parts di&s;|&s;olve away, and are melted by di&s;tance into broad &s;urfaces.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="366">But here again the <HI>colour</HI> offends. The&s;e cliffs are not chalk, yet are &s;o like chalk, that the fo&s;&s;ili&s;t hardly knows what el&s;e to call them. The painter is in the &s;ame dilemma. He finds them not white, but &s;o nearly white, that he hardly knows what other colour to give them. Nature has, in many parts, &s;pread over them a few &s;tains and tints, as &s;he &s;eems always &s;tudious to remove an offen&s;ive glare. But on &s;o large a &s;urface, this has but a partial effect; and the whole coa&s;t, for many leagues together, appears nearly white. Now of all hues the painter di&s;likes white the mo&s;t; as it is the mo&s;t refractory and unaccommodating to his other tints. Of cour&s;e, therefore, the cliffs of the I&s;le of Wight offend him.</P>
<P>From this uniformity of colour, the rocks of Allum-bay &s;hould be excepted; the &s;trata of which are tinted, and marbled with red, brown, blue, and other colours, in a beautiful manner. This bay is nearly oppo&s;ite to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, and is the mo&s;t we&s;tern inlet, which is formed on the northern &s;ide of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance belonging to the we&s;tern rocks of the I&s;le of Wight, which,
<PB N="337" REF="367">
though but a trifling one, is of a picture&s;que nature, and ought, therefore, to be mentioned. At periodical &s;ea&s;ons, they are frequented with prodigious flights of &s;ea-fowl of various kinds. Their numbers can only be de&s;cribed by the hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>darkening the air.</HI> They &s;it commonly, when they are not in mo|tion, on the ledges of the cliffs; in the cran|nies of which they breed. You &s;ee them ranged in black files through a con&s;iderable &s;pace. The report of a gun brings them all out of their rece&s;&s;es; and the air, which a moment before was &s;till and quiet, is now beaten with myriads of bu&s;y wings, and filled with &s;creams and cries as various as the &s;everal tribes from which they i&s;&s;ue. <Q>We have often re&s;ted on our oars under the rocks,</Q> (&s;ays Mr. Pennant, with much de&s;criptive elegance,) <Q>attentive to the &s;ounds above our heads, which, mixed with the &s;olemn roar of the waves &s;welling into the va&s;t caverns beneath, and retiring from them, produced a fine effect. The &s;harp note of the &s;ea-gull, the loud &s;cream of the awk, together with the hoar&s;e, deep, peri|odical croak of the cormorant, which &s;erves as a ba&s;e to the re&s;t, often furni&s;hed us with
<PB N="338" REF="368">
a concert, and, joined with the wild &s;cenery that &s;urrounded us, afforded us a high degree of plea&s;ure.</Q> But it is not, I think, from <HI>novelty,</HI> to which Mr. Pennant a&s;cribes it, that the plea&s;ure ari&s;es. The&s;e notes, though di&s;|cordant in them&s;elves, are in perfect harmony with the wild &s;cenes where they are heard; and this makes them chiefly intere&s;ting. In the views, therefore, of this rocky coa&s;t, the&s;e flights of birds &s;hould never be forgotten, as they may well be numbered among its pictu|re&s;que appendages.</P>
<P>Neither fi&s;h nor fowl can haunt a coa&s;t, but the inhabitants find &s;ome means of turning them to advantage. The&s;e airy inmates of &s;uch cliffs and precipices as hang beetling many fa|thoms above the &s;ea, one &s;hould imagine might pa&s;s their lives in full &s;ecurity. But man, with the hand of art, contrives to reach them. He fixes an iron crow firm in the ground, and tying a rope tight to it, he lets him&s;elf down with a ba&s;ket in his hand, among the middle regions of the cliffs, where the fowls inhabit. So bold and &s;udden an inva&s;ion frights them immediately from their rece&s;&s;es. With a watch|ful eye he examines the parts of the rock
<PB N="339" REF="369">
from which they chiefly e&s;cape; and &s;cram|bling about by the help of his rope, he fills his ba&s;ket with their eggs, for which he can al|ways find a ready market.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds al&s;o furni&s;h <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> to all the neighbouring country. In &s;ummer, a number of &s;hooting parties are formed both by land and &s;ea; and when the weather is fine, you can &s;eldom &s;ail pa&s;t without falling in with &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>That man has a right to de&s;troy &s;uch ani|mals as are <HI>noxious</HI> to him is undoubted. That he has a right al&s;o over the lives of &s;uch ani|mals as are <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to him for food and other nece&s;&s;aries, is equally unque&s;tioned. But whe|ther he has a right to de&s;troy life for his <HI>amu&s;e|ment,</HI> is another que&s;tion. If he is determined to <HI>act the tyrant,</HI> (that is, to con&s;ider <HI>power</HI> as conferring <HI>right,</HI>) the point is decided. Power he certainly has. But if he wi&s;h to act on authorized and equitable principles, let him ju&s;t point out the pa&s;&s;age in his charter of rights over the brute creation, which gives him the liberty of de&s;troying life for his <HI>amu&s;e|ment</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><LG>

<L>The charter was conferred, by which we hold</L>
<L>The fle&s;h of animals in fee; and claim</L>
<L>O'er all we feed on, power of life and death.</L>
<L>But read the in&s;trument, and mark it well.</L>
<L>The oppre&s;&s;ion of a tyrannous control</L>

<P><PB N="340" REF="370">I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks on the nume|rous flights of &s;ea-fowl, with a pa&s;&s;age from Vaillent's Travels in Africa, which is the mo&s;t curious of the kind I have met with. On his landing on Da&s;&s;en i&s;land, at the mouth of Saldanha-bay, near the cape of Good Hope, he tells us, <Q>there ro&s;e &s;uddenly from the whole &s;urface of the i&s;land an immen&s;e ca|nopy, or rather a &s;ky, compo&s;ed of birds of every &s;pecies and of all colours, cormorants, &s;ea-gulls, &s;ea-&s;wallows, pelicans, &amp;c.

relief to my ears. The alarm which we &s;pread was the more general among the&s;e legions of birds, as we principally di&s;turbed the females who were then &s;itting. They had ne&s;ts, eggs, and young to defend. They were like furious harpies let loo&s;e again&s;t us.

<P>There is, be&s;ides the&s;e flights of birds, ano|ther picture&s;que circum&s;tance frequently &s;een on the coa&s;ts of the I&s;le of Wight, which may be mentioned, though it is a dreadful one, that of &s;hipwrecks.

<P>IT has long been a que&s;tion among natu|rali&s;ts, whether the I&s;le of Wight was ever joined to the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire? Its we&s;tern point has greatly the appearance of having been torn and convul&s;ed. Tho&s;e va&s;t in&s;ulated rocks, called the <HI>Needles,</HI> &s;eem plainly to have been wa&s;hed away from the &s;hores of the i&s;land. One of them, which was known by the name of <HI>Lot's Wife,</HI> a tall &s;piral rock, was undermined and &s;wallowed up by the &s;ea not many years ago; and there is every proba|bility that the re&s;t will follow.</P>
<P>What renders this &s;eparation of the i&s;land from the main &s;till more probable is, that the &s;ea makes yearly depredations along that part of the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t called <HI>Hordle-cliff,</HI> which is ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Needles. It has been ob&s;erved too, that there are chalk-rocks at the bottom of the water, exactly like the Needles, all along the channel towards Chri&s;tchurch.</P>

This writer, &s;peaking of the tin trade in Britain, informs us, that the people of Corn|wall brought this metal to a certain i&s;land called <HI>Ictis,</HI> for the &s;ake of its being more ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from thence to the Conti|nent; into which i&s;land they carried it in carts, when the tide ebbed; for <HI>Ictis,</HI> he &s;ays, was only an i&s;land at full &s;ea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. p. 301. ed. Hen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By <HI>Ictis,</HI> it is &s;uppo&s;ed, Diodorus meant the I&s;le of Wight; the ancient name of which was <HI>Vectis,</HI> a name nearly &s;imilar. This opinion however has been oppo&s;ed by &s;ome; and par|ticularly by Mr. Borla&s;e in his Antiquities of Cornwall, who rather &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>Ictis</HI> of Dio|dorus to be &s;ome i&s;land, though he does not well &s;ettle where, upon the coa&s;t of Cornwall. But Mr. Whitaker, in his Hi&s;tory of Man|che&s;ter, has brought forward the old opinion again with new authority.</P>
<P>If then this &s;uppo&s;ition is at length well grounded, we may gather from it the&s;e points of information, that the I&s;le of Wight was once a va&s;t promontory, running out into the &s;ea, like the I&s;le of Purbeck at this time; that
<PB N="345" REF="375">
it was then united &s;olidly to the coa&s;t of Hamp&s;hire at its we&s;tern point, and in all other parts &s;urrounded by the &s;ea; but that about two thou&s;and years ago, (which is &s;omewhat before the time of Diodorus,) the &s;ea had gained &s;o far upon it, that it became in&s;ular and penin&s;ular, according to the flux and reflux of the tide, till at length the &s;ea, gaining &s;till far|ther po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, formed it, as it is at pre&s;ent, into an ab&s;olute i&s;land.</P>
<P>As we entered Lymington-river, we found a fre&s;h proof of the probability of the ancient union between Vectis and the main. The tide was gone, and had left va&s;t &s;tretches of ooze along the de&s;erted &s;hores. Here we &s;aw lying on the right, a huge &s;tump of a tree, which our boatman informed us had been dragged out of the water. He a&s;&s;ured us al&s;o, that roots of oaks, and other trees, were often found on the&s;e banks of mud, which &s;eems &s;till to &s;trengthen the opinion that all this part of the coa&s;t, now covered with the tide, had once been fore&s;t-land.</P>

<P>FROM Lymington we proceeded to South|ampton; but all this part of the country, through New-Fore&s;t, as far as to the bay of Southampton, hath been examined in another work <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fore&s;t Scenery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At Redbridge we cro&s;&s;ed the river, which flows into Southampton-bay, over a long wooden bridge and cau&s;eway, &s;ometimes co|vered by the tide. Ships of con&s;iderable bur|den come up as far as this bridge, where they take in timber from New-Fore&s;t, and other commodities.</P>
<P>A little beyond Redbridge, at a place called Milbroke, a beautiful view opens of South|ampton. Before us lay Southampton-bay, &s;preading into a noble &s;urface of water. The town runs out like a penin&s;ula on the left, and, with its old walls and towers, makes a pictu|re&s;que appearance. On the right, forming the other &s;ide of the bay, appear the &s;kirts of New-Fore&s;t,
<PB REF="377">

and the opening in front is filled with a di&s;tant view of the I&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>Southampton is an elegant well-built town. It &s;tands on the confluence of two large wa|ters; and when the tide is full, is &s;eated on a penin&s;ula. It is a town of great antiquity, and &s;till pre&s;erves its re&s;pectable appendages of ancient walls and gates. The country around is beautiful.</P>
<P>At Southampton we took boat to &s;ee the ruins of Netley-Abbey, which lie about three miles below on the bay. As we approached, nothing could be &s;een from the water; the bank is high and woody, and &s;kreens every thing beyond it. Having landed and walked up the meadows about a quarter of a mile, we entered a circular valley, which &s;eems to be a mile in circumference, and is &s;kreened with wood on every &s;ide <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe much of this wood is now cut down.</NOTE>, except that which opens to a part of the river, and which has probably once been wooded al&s;o. In a dip, near the centre of this valley, &s;tands Netley-abbey. As you approach it, you &s;ee buildings only of the mo&s;t ordinary &s;pecies, gable-ends and &s;quare
<PB N="348" REF="379">
walls, without any ornament, except a few heavy buttre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>You enter a large &s;quare, which was for|merly known by the name of the Fountain-court. The &s;ide on which you enter &s;eems to have been once chambered, and divided into various offices. Such al&s;o was the left &s;ide of the court, where the bakery and ovens may &s;till be traced. But in general, whatever the rooms have been which occupied the&s;e two &s;ides, the traces of them are very ob&s;cure. On the third &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to the entrance, the court is bounded by the &s;outh wall of the great church; and along the fourth &s;ide range dif|ferent apartments, which are the mo&s;t perfect of any that remain in this whole ma&s;s of ruin.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t you enter &s;eems to have been a dining-hall. It is twenty-five paces long and nine broad, and has been vaulted, and cham|bered above. Adjoining to it, on the right, are the pantry and kitchen. You &s;till &s;ee in the former the aperture, or buttery-hatch, through which victuals were conveyed into the hall. The kitchen of Netley-Abbey is inferior to that of Gla&s;tonbury, but is a &s;pacious and lofty vaulted room; and what is peculiar, from one &s;ide of it leads a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age to the river, which &s;ome imagine to have been a com|mon
<PB REF="380">

<PB N="349" REF="381">
&s;ewer, but it is too ample, I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e, to have been intended for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the other end of the dining-hall, you pa&s;s through a &s;mall vaulted room, into the chapter-hou&s;e, which is ten paces &s;quare. This room is beautifully proportioned, and adorned on each &s;ide by three arches, which uniting at the top in ribs, &s;upport a vaulted roof. To this adjoin two &s;maller rooms, from whence there is an entrance to the great church by the cro&s;s ai&s;le.</P>
<P>The great church has been a very elegant piece of Gothic architecture; and is almo&s;t the only part of the whole ruin, which is pic|ture&s;que. All traces of the ai&s;les and pillars are lo&s;t; but the walls are entire, except half the cro&s;s-ai&s;le, which is gone. The ea&s;t and we&s;t windows remain; the former has not yet lo&s;t all its ornaments; and both are very beau|tiful without, as well as within. Maundrel tells us, that the ea&s;t windows in all the Chri&s;tian churches he met with in his travels as far as Tyre, which were not fewer than a hundred, were left uninjured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maundrel's Travels, p. 49.</NOTE>. A &s;imilar remark, I think, may be made on mo&s;t of the ruined churches in England. The fact is &s;ingular,
<PB N="350" REF="382">
but whether it is owing to chance or &s;uper|&s;tition may be doubted. In that part of the cro&s;s-ai&s;le at Netley-Abbey which remains, a &s;mall part of the &s;tone roof is &s;till left, and is a very curious &s;pecimen of Gothic antiquity.</P>
<P>More of this roof might &s;till have remained if the warnings of Heaven (as that renowned antiquarian Brown Willis informs us) had taken effect. From him we have an anecdote, which, <HI>he a&s;&s;ures us,</HI> is founded on fact, of a carpenter, who once trafficked with the owner of Netley for this elegant roof, which he meant to pull down and convert into gain. As he retired to re&s;t, his &s;lumbers were di&s;|turbed with dreadful dreams. The&s;e having no effect, the next night vi&s;ions appeared; venerable old men in Monki&s;h habits, with frowning faces and threatening hands. Still he pur&s;ued his wicked purpo&s;e. But the next night he had &s;carce fallen a&s;leep, when a mon|&s;trous coping-&s;tone fell plumb upon his head. He &s;tarted with horror, and was hardly at length per&s;uaded it was a dream. All this having only a momentary effect, in the morn|ing he went to work on the execution of his de&s;ign. No farther warning was given him. He had &s;carce mounted a ladder, when a cop|ing-&s;tone fell in earne&s;t from the roof, and put
<PB N="351" REF="383">
him to in&s;tant death. Others, however, it &s;eems, have been found, notwith&s;tanding this example, who have pur&s;ued the de&s;ign, for a mere fragment of the roof only now remains.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or pur&s;ues an oppo&s;ite extreme. The whole body of the church is now &s;o choaked with ruin, and overgrown with thickets and ivy-bu&s;hes, that the greate&s;t part of the building is invi&s;ible. A degree of all the&s;e, no doubt, would be ornamental; but like other ornaments, when they are too pro|fu&s;ely &s;cattered, they offend. The&s;e ruins are as much ob&s;tructed on the out&s;ide, as they are within. We walked round them, and could find only two places, the two end windows, where we could po&s;&s;ibly take a view. Every other approach is excluded, except on the &s;ide we entered, which lea&s;t de&s;erves to be expo&s;ed. This part is &s;o very ordinary, that it rai&s;es a prejudice at fir&s;t again&s;t the whole; and the ruin would be &s;hewn to much more advantage if this &s;ide were blocked up with wood, and the approach made either by the ea&s;t or we&s;t window of the great church. Beyond the ruins are the remains of large &s;tew-ponds, which were formerly appendages of the abbey.</P>

<P>AS we &s;et &s;ail from Netley-Abbey, we had a beautiful view of Southampton, running from us in a point directly oppo&s;ite to that view which we had from Redbridge. The indentations made by the river Itchin, and other creeks, are great advantages to the view.</P>
<P>From Southampton we took our rout to Winche&s;ter, through a very beautiful country. The fir&s;t object is an artificial avenue, com|po&s;ed of detached groups of fir. The idea of an avenue as a connecting thread between a town and a country, is a good one. We ob&s;erve, however, that the beauty of this avenue is much greater as we approach Southampton, than as we leave it. As we leave it, the ave|nue ends abruptly in a naked country; but as we turned round, and viewed it in retro&s;pect, it united with the woody &s;cene around it, which had a good effect. A retro&s;pect al&s;o
<PB REF="385">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="353" REF="386">
afforded beautiful views over Southampton river, and its appendages, the town, New-fore&s;t, and the I&s;le of Wight. All this plea&s;|ing country appeared under various forms; and was often &s;et off with good foregrounds.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the avenue, and a few miles of mi&s;cellaneous country, no way intere&s;ting, we entered, about the &s;ixth &s;tone, a fore&s;t-&s;cene, abounding with all the charms of that &s;pecies of land&s;cape. In this we continued three or four miles.</P>
<P>From the&s;e woody &s;cenes the country be|comes more heathy; but is &s;till diver&s;ified with wood, and affords many plea&s;ing di&s;tances on the right; till at length it &s;uddenly dege|nerates into chalky grounds, which are of the &s;ame kind as tho&s;e de&s;cribed in our approach to Winche&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We left Winche&s;ter by the Ba&s;ing&s;toke road; which pa&s;&s;es through a country, with little pic|ture&s;que beauty on either hand. It becomes by degrees flat and unplea&s;ant, and &s;oon dege|nerates into common-field land, which, with its
<PB N="354" REF="387">
&s;triped divi&s;ions, is of all kinds of country generally the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Near Ba&s;ing&s;toke &s;tand the ruins of Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e, which we cannot pa&s;s without feeling a re&s;pect for the gallant figure it made, beyond that of any fortre&s;s of its &s;ize, in the civil wars of Charles I. It was at that time the &s;eat of the Marquis of Winche&s;ter, who fortified and held it for the king, during the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e trouble&s;ome times, though it underwent an almo&s;t continued blockade. Once it was &s;o far reduced by famine, as to be on the point of &s;urrendering; and its relief by Colonel Gage was con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t &s;ol|dierly actions of the war. Lord Clarendon has detailed this gallant enterprize at length. The outlines of it are the&s;e. The King was then at Oxford. He had been applied to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance by the garri&s;on at Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e; but it was blockaded by &s;o large a force, that all the mili|tary men about him thought any attempt to relieve it, de&s;perate. Gage, however, offered his &s;ervice; and getting together a few volun|teers, well mounted, undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s. On Monday night he left Oxford, which is forty miles from Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e; came up with the be&s;iegers before day-light on Wedne&s;day
<PB N="355" REF="388">
morning; forced their lines by an unexpected attack; and entered the place with a &s;tring of hor&s;es laden with provi&s;ion. The enemy &s;oon found how contemptible a number had alarmed them; and returning to their po&s;ts, began to clo&s;e up the avenues. Gage, with that readi|ne&s;s of invention which is able to command the cri&s;is of a great action, &s;ent orders into the country, to provide quantities of provi&s;ion for a large reinforcement, which he hourly ex|pected. This intelligence gave a momentary pau&s;e to the motions of the enemy. A mo|ment was all that Gage wanted. He i&s;&s;ued in|&s;tantly from the garri&s;on with his &s;mall troop of hor&s;e; and through bye roads got &s;afe to Oxford without interruption. Thus relieved, Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e continued to baffle all the at|tempts of the Parliament, till the fatal battle of Na&s;eby. After that event misfortunes came in with a full tide upon the king. Every day brought him &s;ome new account of the lo&s;s of his garri&s;ons; and among other places he had the mortification to hear of the lo&s;s of Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e. Cromwell him&s;elf appeared before it, and &s;ummoning it in haughty language, was an&s;wered with &s;corn. The incen&s;ed chief fell upon it with a body of his veteran troops; car|ried
<PB N="356" REF="389">
it by a&s;&s;ault; and put the garri&s;on to the &s;word.&mdash;Among the few fugitives that e&s;caped, was the celebrated engraver Hollar, who had been &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle. This event, in a picture&s;que work, is a circum&s;tance worth mentioning.</P>
<P>From Ba&s;ing&s;toke we continued our route to Bag&s;hot. Lord Albermarle's hou&s;e and im|provements appeared to great advantage, con|tra&s;ted by the heath, which &s;urrounded them. They &s;eemed like an i&s;land in the main. As we approached Stains, the Duke of Cumber|land's plantations in Wind&s;or-park made a no|ble appearance.</P>
<P>From Stains we cro&s;&s;ed the Thames at King|&s;ton, where we entered Surrey.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this volume went to pre&s;s, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's Lectures fell into the author's hands, which he had never &s;een before. As they point out two or three mi&s;takes which he had made, he thinks it proper to mention them in an Appendix. In page 46, &s;peaking of monu|ments in churches, he expre&s;&s;es his doubts, whether the <Q>introduction of them will be any advantage to St. Paul's; which the judicious architect, he &s;uppo&s;es, had already adorned as much as he thought con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ublimity of his idea.</Q> In &s;peaking on the &s;ame &s;ubject, Sir Jo&s;hua, on the contrary, in|forms us, that <Q>Sir Chri&s;topher Wren left niches in St. Paul's on purpo&s;e for monuments, bu&s;ts, &s;ingle figures, bas-reliefs, and groups of figures. <BIBL>Vol. ii. p. 242.</BIBL></Q> The author can only &s;ay, that he does not remember any niches or rece&s;&s;es in St. Paul's, which gave him ideas of this kind; but as what Sir Jo&s;hua &s;ays is given as <HI>information;</HI> and his remark depends only on <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>recollection,</HI> it mu&s;t of cour&s;e give way.</P>
<P>In page 112, he &s;peak highly of Vandyck's &s;uperiority as a <HI>portrait painter;</HI> but &s;lightly of
<PB N="358" REF="391">
his abilities <HI>in hi&s;tory.</HI> A large piece, in which Vandyck has many figures to manage, he &s;up|po&s;es to be a work which required more &s;kill in compo&s;ition than Vandyck po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His opi|nion is formed chiefly on the great family-pic|ture at Wilton, which gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e re|marks; and on two large pictures which he had formerly &s;een, and examined at Houghton-hall; in none of which the compo&s;ition <HI>plea&s;ed him.</HI> But Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, in his Travels through Flanders, tells us, that he &s;aw at Mecklin, a pic|ture of the Crucifixion by Vandyck, which he thought one of the fir&s;t pictures in the world; and &s;cruples not to &s;ay, he thinks Vandyck had a genius for hi&s;tory-painting. The author can|not with&s;tand &s;uch authority; but mu&s;t withdraw his own opinion&mdash;or, at lea&s;t, keep it mode&s;tly to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But though he had the mortification to find he differed from Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds in the&s;e, and a few more particulars, he had the plea&s;ure to find they agreed in a number of others. Two or three of them belong to the volume before us. In page 117, the author ob&s;erves that he had oftener than once judged fal&s;ely on the <HI>fir&s;t &s;ight</HI> of Salvator's pictures, which plea&s;ed him more on a &s;econd view. This, however, he con&s;iders as a fault; for we expect from a good
<PB N="359" REF="392">
picture, as from a good man, a favourable im|pre&s;&s;ion at &s;ight. Sir Jo&s;hua's opinion of a good picture is the &s;ame. He &s;ays, <Q>it &s;hould plea&s;e at fir&s;t &s;ight, and appear to incite the &s;pectator's attention. <BIBL>Vol. i. p. 208.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the 21&s;t page, the beautiful effect of ea&s;y action in a &s;tatue, in oppo&s;ition to none at all, is con&s;idered; and the Venus, the Apollo, the li&s;tening Slave, and the Farne&s;ian Hercules re&s;ting from one of his labours, are in&s;tanced. All the&s;e gentle modes of <HI>action,</HI> or <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> are con&s;idered, in the pa&s;&s;age alluded to, as much more beautiful than the unintere&s;ting vacancy of a con&s;ul &s;tanding erect in his robes.&mdash;He had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee remarks exactly &s;imilar to the&s;e in one of Sir Jo&s;hua's Lectures (vol. i. p. 259.). <Q>Tho&s;e works of the ancients,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>which are in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, have &s;ome|thing be&s;ide mere &s;implicity to recommend them. The Apollo, the Venus, the Lao|coon, the Gladiator, have a certain compo|&s;ition of action, with contra&s;ts &s;ufficient to give grace and energy in a high degree. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed of the many thou&s;and &s;tatues which we have, their general charac|teri&s;tic is bordering at lea&s;t on inanimate in|&s;ipidity.</Q></P>
