<HEAD>TO Mrs. DANCER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a country, where addre&s;&s;es of this nature have generally waited upon the Great, upon a Wealthy Merchant, a Rich Commi&s;&s;ary, or &s;ome New Man from the Sugar-i&s;lands, it will appear as &s;urprizing, to many, as, no doubt, it will to your&s;elf, that a New Form of Dedication &s;hould now be introduced. For the trouble I am giving you it will, however, be unnece&s;&s;ary to make any further apology, when I ob&s;erve that in France, where talents are honoured, it has been frequently the practice of the mo&s;t cele|brated wits to do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e, who, by their pro|fe&s;&s;ion, are the very Organ of the Mu&s;es. A VOL|TAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compli|ments to a CLAIRON: and why may not an Engli&s;h Author, inferior as he is, and ever mu&s;t be, to writers of that cla&s;s, rival at lea&s;t their politene&s;s, by addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mrs. DANCER, one of the fir&s;t Ornaments of the Briti&s;h Theatre?</P>
<P>There are, indeed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it, &s;ome demands upon my gratitude on this occa&s;ion, which even now are &s;truggling to call my attention another way. Mr. GARRICK, Madam, has a claim to all the hand|&s;ome things that can be &s;aid of him. His politene&s;s from the moment he &s;aw the play, his a&s;&s;iduity in preparing it for repre&s;entation, the ta&s;te with which he has decorated it, and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece, are circum&s;tances that call upon me for the &s;tronge&s;t acknowledgements. I
<PB REF="4">
could employ my pen with plea&s;ure in thanking Mr. BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers, wherever the Poet gave the &s;malle&s;t opportunity. Mr. HOLLAND, who had before now given &s;pirit to &s;uch &s;cenes as mine, has renewed the obligation. I could add others to the li&s;t, but they, and even Mr. GARRICK at their head, mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I turn to Mrs. DANCER, and &s;ay with <HI>Hamlet,</HI> "Here's mettle more attractive."</P>
<P>ZENOBIA, Madam, is your own entirely. Where|ever my inaccuracy has left imperfections, they are &s;o happily varni&s;hed over by your &s;kill, that either they are not &s;een, or you extort forgivene&s;s for them: and if the Author is any where happy enough to <HI>&s;natch a grace</HI> beyond his u&s;ual reach, it is multi|plied by your addre&s;s into a number of beauties, like the SWORD in <HI>Ta&s;&s;o'</HI>s <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which, when bran|di&s;hed by the hand of <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS.</P>
<P>The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary. She was &s;aved in her life-time from the waters of the <HI>Araxes</HI> by the hand of a &s;hepherd, and now &s;he is &s;aved from the critics by Mrs. DANCER.</P>
<P>In te&s;timony of the fact, the play, Madam, is now in&s;cribed to you by him, who admires your talents, and remains</P>

<L>OF old,&mdash;when Greece in a declining age</L>

<L>This was the tyrant's art:&mdash;He gave a prize</L>

<L>Ye bards,&mdash;to whom French wit gives kind relief,</L>

<L>HOW do you all, good folks?&mdash;In tears for certain,</L>
<L>I'll only take a PEEP BEHIND THE CURTAIN;</L>
<L>You're all &s;o full of tragedy, and &s;adne&s;s!</L>
<L>For me to come among ye, would be madne&s;s:</L>
<L>This is no time for giggling&mdash;when you've lei&s;ure,</L>
<L>Call out for me, and I'll attend your plea&s;ure;</L>
<L>As &s;oldiers hurry at the beat of drum,</L>
<L>Beat but your hands, that in&s;tant I will come.</L>

<L>This is &s;o good, to call me out &s;o &s;oon&mdash;</L>
<L>The COMIC MUSE by me intreats a BOON;</L>
<L>She call'd for PRITCHARD, her fir&s;t maid of honour,</L>

<L>But &s;he,&mdash;I'm &s;ure you'll all be &s;orry for't,</L>
