<HEAD>DISSERTATION ON FIRST-PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject in which mankind are more univer&s;ally intere&s;ted than in the &s;ubject of govern|ment. His &s;ecurity, be he rich or poor, and, in a great mea&s;ure, his pro&s;perity is connected therewith; it is there|fore his intere&s;t as well as his duty to make him&s;elf acquainted with its principles, and what the practice ought to be.</P>
<P>Every art and &s;cience, however imperfectly known at fir&s;t, has been &s;tudied, improved, and brought to what we call perfection by the progre&s;&s;ive labours of &s;ucceeding generations; but the &s;cience of government has &s;tood &s;till. No improvement has been made in the principle and &s;carcely any in the practice till the American revolution began. In all the countries of Europe (except in France) the &s;ame forms and &s;y&s;tems that were erected in the remote
<PB N="4" REF="3">ages of ignorance &s;till continue, and their antiquity is pile in the place of principle; it is forbidden to inve&s;tigate their origin or by what right they exi&s;t; if it be a&s;ked how has this happened, the an&s;wer is ea&s;y; they are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on a principle that is fal&s;e, and they employ their power to prevent detection.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the my&s;tery with which the &s;cience of government has been enveloped, for the purpo&s;e of en&s;laving, plundering, and impo&s;ing upon mankind, it is of all things the lea&s;t my&s;terious and the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be under&s;tood. The meane&s;t capacity cannot be at a lo&s;s, if it begins its enquiries at the right point. Every art and &s;cience has &s;ome point, or alphabet, at which the &s;tudy of that art or &s;cience begins, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which the progre&s;s is facilitated. The &s;ame method ought to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the &s;cience of government.</P>
<P>In&s;tead then of embarra&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject in the out&s;et with the numerous &s;ubdivi&s;ions, under which different forms of government have been cla&s;&s;ed, &s;uch as ari&s;to|cracy, democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, &amp;c. the better method will be to begin with what may be called primary divi&s;ions, or tho&s;e under which all the &s;everal &s;ubdivi&s;ions will be comprehended.</P>
<P>The primary divi&s;ions are but two.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, government by election and repre&s;entation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, government by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All the &s;everal forms and &s;y&s;tems of government, however numerous or diver&s;ified, cla&s;s them&s;elves under one or other of tho&s;e primary divi&s;ions; for either they are on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation, or on that of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. As to
<PB N="5" REF="4">that equivocal thing called mixed government, &s;uch as the late government of Holland and the pre&s;ent government of England, it does not make an exception to the general rule, becau&s;e the parts &s;eparately con&s;idered are either re|pre&s;entative or hereditary.</P>
<P>Beginning then our enquiries at this point, we have fir&s;t to examine into the nature of tho&s;e two primary divi|&s;ions. If they are equally right in principle, it is mere matter of opinion which we prefer. If the one be demon|&s;tratively better than the other, that difference &s;hould direct our choice; but if one of them be &s;o ab&s;olutely fal&s;e as not to have a right to exi&s;tence, the matter &s;ettles it&s;elf at once; becau&s;e a negative proved on one thing, where two only are offered, and one mu&s;t be accepted, amounts to an affirmative on the other.</P>
<P>The revolutions that are now &s;preading them&s;elves in the world have their origin in this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and the pre&s;ent war is a conflict between the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem founded on the rights of the people and the here|ditary &s;y&s;tem founded in u&s;urpation. As to what are called Monarchy, Royalty, and Ari&s;tocracy, they do not, either as things or as terms, &s;ufficiently de&s;cribe the hereditary &s;y&s;tem; they are but &s;econdary things or &s;igns of the he|reditary &s;y&s;tem, and which fall of them&s;elves if that &s;y&s;tem has not a right to exi&s;t. Were there no &s;uch terms as Monarchy, Royalty and Ari&s;tocracy, or were other terms &s;ub&s;tituted in their place, the hereditary &s;y&s;tem, if it con|tinued, would not be altered then by. It would be the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem under any other titulary name as it is now.</P>
<P>The character therefore of the revolutions of the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="6" REF="5">day di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf mo&s;t definitively by grounding it&s;elf on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entative government in oppo|&s;ition to the hereditary. No other di&s;tinction reaches the whole of the principle.</P>
<P>Having thus opened the ca&s;e generally, I proceed, in the fir&s;t place, to examine the hereditary &s;y&s;tem, becau&s;e it has the priority in point of time. The repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem is the invention of the modern world; and that no doubt may ari&s;e as to my own opinion, I declare it before hand, which is, <HI>that there is not a problem in Euclid more mathematically true than that hereditary government has not a right to exi&s;t. When therefore we take from any man the exerci&s;e of hereditary power, we take away that which he never had the right to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which no law or cu&s;tom could, or ever can, give him a title to</HI></P>
<P>The arguments that have hitherto been employed again&s;t the hereditary &s;y&s;tem, have been chiefly founded upon the ab&s;urdity of it, and its incompetency to the purpo&s;e of good government. Nothing can pre&s;ent to our judgement, or to our imagination, a figure of greater ab&s;urdity, than that of &s;eeing the government of a nation fall, as it fre|quently does, into the hands of a lad nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of experience and often little better than a fool. It is an in&s;ult to every man of years, of character, and of talent, in a country. The moment we begin to rea&s;on upon the hereditary &s;y&s;tem it falls into deri&s;ion; let but a &s;ingle idea begin and a thou&s;and will &s;oon follow. In&s;ignificance, imbecility, childhood, dotage, want of moral character; in fine, every defect &s;erious or laughable unite to hold up the hereditary &s;y&s;tem as a figure of ridicule. Leaving however
<PB N="7" REF="6">the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the thing to the reflections of the reader, I proceed to the more important part of the que&s;|tion, namely, whether &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem has a right to exi&s;t?</P>
<P>To be &s;atisfied of the right of a thing to exi&s;t, we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied that it had a right to begin. If it had not a right to begin, it has not a right to continue. By what right then did the hereditary &s;y&s;tem begin? Let a man but a&s;k him&s;elf this que&s;tion, and he will find that he cannot &s;atisfy him&s;elf with an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The right which any man, or any family had to &s;et it&s;elf up at fir&s;t to govern a nation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf hereditarily, was no other than the right which Robe&s;pierre had to do the &s;ame thing in France. If he had none, they had none. If they had any, he had as much, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover &s;uperiority of right in any family, by virtue of which hereditary government could begin. The Capets, the Guelphs, the Robe&s;pierres, the Marats, are all on the &s;ame &s;tanding as to the que&s;tion of right. It belongs exclu&s;ively to none.</P>
<P>It is one &s;tep towards liberty, to perceive that hereditary government could not begin as an exclu&s;ive right in any family. The next point will be, whether, having once began, it could grow into a right by the influence of time?</P>
<P>This would be &s;uppo&s;ing an ab&s;urdity; for either it is putting time in the place of principle, or making it &s;upe|rior to principle; whereas time has no more connection with, or influence upon principle, than principle has upon time. The wrong which began a thou&s;and years ago, is as much a wrong, as if it began to day; and the right which originates to day, is as much a right as if it had the
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;anction of a thou&s;and years. Time with re&s;pect to prin|ciples is an eternal NOW: it has no operation upon them: it changes nothing of their nature and qualities. But what have we to do with a thou&s;and years. Our life time is but a &s;hort portion of that period, and if we find the wrong in exi&s;tence as &s;oon as we begin to live, that is the point of time at which it begins to us; and our right to re&s;i&s;t it, is the &s;ame as if it had never exi&s;ted before.</P>
<P>As hereditary government could not begin as a natural right in any family, nor derive after its commencement any right from time, we have only to examine whether there exi&s;t in a nation a right to &s;et it up and e&s;tabli&s;h it by what is called law, as has been done in England. I an&s;wer NO; and that any law or any con&s;titution made for that purpo&s;e is an act of trea&s;on again&s;t the rights of every minor in the nation, at the time it is made, and again&s;t the rights of all &s;ucceeding generations. I &s;hall &s;peak upon each of tho&s;e ca&s;es. Fir&s;t, of the minor at the time &s;uch law is made. Secondly, of the generations that are to follow.</P>
<P>A nation in a collective &s;en&s;e, comprehends all the indi|viduals of whatever age, from ju&s;t born to ju&s;t dying. Of the&s;e, one part will be minors, the other aged. The average of life is not exactly the &s;ame in every climate and country, but in general the minority in years are the majo|rity in numbers, that is, the number of per&s;ons under twenty one years, is greater than the number of per&s;ons above that age. This difference in number is not nece&s;|&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the principle I mean to lay down, but it &s;erves to &s;hew the ju&s;tice of it more &s;trongly,
<PB N="9" REF="8">The principle would be equally good, if the majority in years were al&s;o the majority in numbers.</P>
<P>The rights of minors are as &s;acred as the rights of the aged. The difference is altogether in the different age of the two parties and nothing in the nature of the rights; the rights are the &s;ame rights; and are to be pre&s;erved inviolate for the inheritance of the minors when they &s;hall come of age. During the minority of minors, their rights are under the &s;acred guardian&s;hip of the aged. The minor, cannot &s;urrender them; the guardian cannot di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him; con&s;equently, the aged part of a nation who are the lawmakers for the <HI>time being,</HI> and who, in the march of life, are but a few years a head of tho&s;e who are yet minors, and to whom they mu&s;t &s;hortly give place, have not and cannot have the right to make a law to &s;et up and e&s;ta|bli&s;h hereditary government, or, to &s;peak more di&s;tinctly, <HI>an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of governors;</HI> becau&s;e it is an attempt to deprive every minor in the nation, at the time &s;uch a law is made, of his inheritance of rights, when he &s;hall come of age, and to &s;ubjugate him to a &s;y&s;tem of government to which, during his minority, he could neither con&s;ent nor object.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on, who is a minor at the time &s;uch a law is propo&s;ed, had happened to have been born a few years &s;ooner, &s;o as to be of the age of twenty one years at the time of propo&s;ing it, his right to have objected again&s;t it, to have expo&s;ed the inju&s;tice and tyrannical principles of it, and to have voted again&s;t it, will be admitted on all &s;ides. If, therefore, the law operates to prevent his exerci&s;ing the &s;ame rights after he comes of age as he would have had a
<PB N="10" REF="9">right to exerci&s;e had he been of age at the time, it is, undeniably, a law to take away and annul the rights of every per&s;on in the nation who &s;hall be a minor at the time of making &s;uch a law, and con&s;equently the right to make it cannot exi&s;t.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak of government by hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion as it applies to &s;ucceeding generations; and to &s;hew that in this ca&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of minors, there does not exi&s;t in a nation a right to &s;et it up.</P>
<P>A nation, though continually exi&s;ting, is continually in a &s;tate of renewal and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It is never &s;tationary. Every day produces new births, carries minors forward to maturity, and old per&s;ons from the &s;tage. In this ever running flood of generations there is no part &s;uperior in authority to another. Could we conceive an idea of &s;upe|riority in any, at what point of time, or in what century of the world, are we to fix it? To what cau&s;e are we to a&s;cribe it? By what evidence are we to prove it? By what criterion are we to know it? A &s;ingle reflection will teach us that our ance&s;tors, like our&s;elves, were but tenants for life in the great freehold of rights. The fee-ab&s;olute was not in them, it is not in us, it belongs to the whole family of man, thro' all ages. If we think otherwi&s;e than this, we think either as &s;laves or as tyrants. As &s;laves, if we think that any former generation had a right to bind us; as tyrants, if we think that we have authority to bind the ge|nerations that are to follow.</P>
<P>It may not be inapplicable to the &s;ubject, to endeavour to define what is to be under&s;tood by a generation in the &s;en&s;e the word is here u&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">As a natural term its meaning is &s;ufficiently clear. The father, the &s;on, the grand&s;on are &s;o many di&s;tinct genera|tions. But when we &s;peak of a generation as de&s;cribing the per&s;ons in whom legal authority re&s;ides, as di&s;tinct from another generation of the &s;ame de&s;cription who are to &s;ucceed them, it comprehends all tho&s;e who are above the age of twenty one years, at the time we count from; and a generation of this kind will continue in authority between fourteen and twenty one years, that is, until the number of minors, who &s;hall have arrived at age, &s;hall be greater than the number of per&s;ons remaining of the former &s;tock.</P>
<P>For example, if France at this or any other moment, contain twenty four millions of &s;ouls, twelve millions will be males, and twelve females. Of the twelve mil|lions of males, &s;ix millions will be of the age of twenty one years, and &s;ix will be under, and the authority to govern will re&s;ide in the fir&s;t &s;ix. But every day will make &s;ome alteration, and in twenty one years every one of tho&s;e minors who &s;urvive will have arrived at age, and the greater part of the former &s;tock will be gone: the majority of per&s;ons then living, in whom the legal authority re&s;ides, will be compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who, twenty one years before, had no legal exi&s;tence. Tho&s;e will be fathers and grand fathers in their turn, and in the next twenty one years, (or le&s;s) another race of minors, arrived at age, will &s;ucceed them, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>As this is ever the ca&s;e, and as every generation is equal in rights to another, it con&s;equently follows, that there cannot be a right in any to e&s;tabli&s;h government by here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it would be &s;uppo&s;ing it&s;elf
<PB N="12" REF="11">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a right &s;uperior to the re&s;t, namely, that of commanding by its own authority how the world &s;hall be hereafter governed, and who &s;hall govern it. Every age and generation is and mu&s;t be (as a matter of right) as free to act for it&s;elf in all ca&s;es, as the age and generation that preceded it. The vanity and pre&s;umption of govern|ing beyond the grave is the mo&s;t ridiculous and in&s;olent of all tyrannics. Man has no property in man, neither has one generation a property in the generations that are to follow.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> I have &s;poken of govern|ment by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and I will here clo&s;e the &s;ubject with an extract from that work, which &s;tates it under the two following heads.</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, of the right of any family to e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf with hereditary power.</P>
<P>"Secondly, of the right of a nation to e&s;tabli&s;h a parti|cular family.</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of tho&s;e heads, that of a family e&s;tabli&s;hing it&s;elf with hereditary powers on its own autho|rity independant of the nation, all men will concur in calling it de&s;poti&s;m, and it would be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on their under&s;tanding to attempt to prove it.</P>
<P>"But the &s;econd head, that of a nation, that is, of a gene|ration for the time being, e&s;tabli&s;hing a particular family with hereditary powers, it does not pre&s;ent it&s;elf as de&s;poti&s;m on the fir&s;t reflection; but if men will permit a &s;econd reflection to take place, and carry that reflection forward, even but one remove out of their own per&s;ons to that of heir offpring, they will then &s;ee, that hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="13" REF="12">becomes the &s;ame de&s;poti&s;m to others, which the fir&s;t per&s;ons reprobated for them&s;elves. It operates to preclude the con&s;ent of the &s;ucceeding generation, and the preclu&s;ion of con&s;ent is de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>"In order to &s;ee this matter more clearly, let us con&s;ider the generation which undertakes to e&s;tabli&s;h a family with hereditary powers, &s;eparately from the generations which are to follow.</P>
<P>"The generation which fir&s;t &s;elects a per&s;on and puts him at the head of its government, either with the title of king, or any other nominal di&s;tinction, acts its own choice, as a free agent for it&s;elf, be that choice wi&s;e or fooli&s;h. The per&s;on &s;o &s;et up is <HI>not hereditary,</HI> but &s;elected and ap|pointed; and the generation which &s;ets him up, does not live under an hereditary government, but under a govern|ment of its own choice. Were the per&s;on &s;o &s;et up, and the generation who &s;ets him up, to live for ever, it never could become hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and of con&s;equence, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion can only follow on the death of the fir&s;t parties.</P>
<P>"As therefore hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is out of the que&s;|tion, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t generation, we have next to con&s;ider the character in which that generation acts towards the commencing generation and to all &s;ucceeding ones.</P>
<P>"It a&s;&s;umes a character to which it has neither right nor title; for it changes it&s;elf from a legi&s;lator to a te&s;tator, and affects to make a will and te&s;tament, which is to have operation, after the demi&s;e of the makers, to bequeath the government; and it not only attempts to
<PB N="14" REF="13">bequeath, but to e&s;tabli&s;h on the &s;ucceeding generation a new and different form of government under which it&s;elf lived. It&s;elf, as al ready ob&s;erved, lived not under an hereditary government, but under a government of its own choice; and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and te&s;ta|ment, which it has not authority to make, to take from the commencing generation, and from all future ones, the right and free agency by which it&s;elf acted.</P>
<P>"In whatever light hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as growing out of the will and te&s;tament of &s;ome former generation, pre&s;ents it&s;elf, it is both criminal and ab&s;urd. A cannot make a will to take from B the property of B and give it to C; yet this is the manner in which, what is called hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by law, operates. A certain genera|tion makes a will, under the form of a law to take away the rights of the commencing generation, and of all future generations, and convey tho&s;e rights to a third per&s;on who afterwards comes forward and a&s;&s;umes the government in con&s;equence of that illicit conveyance."</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h parliament furni&s;hes an example of this kind; and which merits to be recorded as being the greate&s;t in&s;tance of legi&s;lative ignorance and want of principle that is to be found in the hi&s;tory of any country. The ca&s;e is as follows.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h parliament of 1688, imported a man and his wife from Holland, <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and made them king and queen of England. Having done this, the &s;aid parliament made a law to convey the government of the country to the heirs of William and Mary in the following words, <Q>We the lords-&s;piritual and temporal,
<PB N="15" REF="14">and commons, do in the name of the people of England, mo&s;t humbly and faithfully &s;ubmit <HI>our&s;elves, our heirs, and po&s;terities,</HI> to William and Mary, <HI>their heirs and po&s;terities</HI> for ever.</Q> And in a &s;ub&s;equent law, as quoted by Edmund Burke, the &s;aid parliament, in the name of the people of England then living, <HI>binds the &s;aid people, their heirs and po&s;terities, to William and Mary, their heirs and po&s;terities, to the end of time.</HI></P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient that we laugh at the ignorance of &s;uch law makers; it is nece&s;&s;ary that we reprobate their want of principle. The con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly of France 1789 fell into the &s;ame vice as the parliament of England had done, and a&s;&s;umed to e&s;tabli&s;h an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the family of the Capets, as an act of the con&s;titution of that year. That every nation, <HI>for the time being,</HI> has a right to govern it&s;elf as it plea&s;es, mu&s;t always be admit|ted; but government by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is govern|ment for another race of people and not for it&s;elf; and as tho&s;e on whom it is to operate, are not yet in exi&s;tence or are minors, &s;o neither is the right in exi&s;tence to &s;et it up for them, and to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a right is trea&s;on again&s;t the right of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I here clo&s;e the arguments on the fir&s;t head, that of government by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and proceed to the &s;econd, that of government by election and repre&s;entation; or as it may be conci&s;ely expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>repre&s;entative government</HI> in contra-di&s;tinction to <HI>hereditary government.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;oning by exclu&s;ion, if <HI>hereditary government</HI> has not a right to exi&s;t, and that it has not is proveable, <HI>repre|&s;entative government</HI> is admitted of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">In contemplating government by election and repre|&s;entation, we amu&s;e not our&s;elves in enquiring when or how, or by what right it began. Its origin is ever in view. Man is him&s;elf the origin and the evidence of the right. It appertains to him in right of his exi&s;tence, and his per&s;on is the title deed.</P>
<P>The true and only true ba&s;is of repre&s;entative govern|ment is equality of Rights. Every man has a right to one vote and no more in the choice of repre&s;entatives. The rich have no more right to exclude the poor from the right of voting, or of electing and being elected, than the poor have to exclude the rich; and wherever it is attempted, or propo&s;ed, on either &s;ide, it is a que&s;tion of force and not of right. Who is he that would exclude another? That other has the &s;ame right to exclude him.</P>
<P>That which is now called ari&s;tocracy implies an ine|quality of rights, but who are the per&s;ons that have a right to e&s;tabli&s;h this inequality? Will the rich exclude them|&s;elves? No. Will the poor exclude them&s;elves! No. By what right then can any be excluded? It would be a que&s;tion, if any man or cla&s;s of men have a right to exclude them&s;elves; but, be this as it may, they cannot have the right to exclude another. The poor will not delegate &s;uch a right to the rich, nor the rich to the poor, and to a&s;&s;ume it, is not only to a&s;&s;ume arbitrary power, but to a&s;&s;ume a right to commit robbery. Per&s;onal rights, of which the right of voting for repre&s;entatives is one, are a &s;pecies of property of the mo&s;t &s;acred kind: and he that would employ his pecuniary property, or pre&s;ume upon the influence it gives him, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s or rob another of his property of rights,
<PB N="17" REF="16">u&s;es that pecuniary property, as he would u&s;e fire-arms, and merits to have it taken from him.</P>
<P>Inequality of rights is created by a combination in one part of the community to exclude another part from its rights. Whenever it be made an article of a con&s;titution, or a law, that the right of voting, or of electing and being elected, &s;hall appertain exclu&s;ively to per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a certain quantity of property, be it little or much, it is a combination of the per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that quantity, to ex|clude tho&s;e who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame quantity. It is inve&s;ting them&s;elves with powers as a &s;elf-created part of &s;ociety, to the exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is always to be taken for granted, that tho&s;e who oppo&s;e an equality of rights, never mean the exclu&s;ion &s;hould take place on them&s;elves; and in this view of the ca&s;e, pardoning the vanity of the thing, ari&s;tocracy is a &s;ubject of laughter. This &s;elf-&s;oothing vanity is encou|raged by another idea not le&s;s &s;el&s;i&s;h, which is, that the oppo&s;ers conceive they are playing a &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me, in which there is a chance to gain and none to lo&s;e; that at any &s;ate the doctrine of equality includes <HI>them,</HI> and that if they cannot get more rights than tho&s;e whom they oppo&s;e and would exclude, they &s;hall not have le&s;s. This opinion has already been fatal to thou&s;ands who, not contented with <HI>equal rights,</HI> have &s;ought more till they lo&s;t all, and experienced in them&s;elves the degrading <HI>inequality</HI> they endeavoured to fix upon others.</P>
<P>In any view of the ca&s;e it is dangerous and impolitic, &s;ome|times ridiculous, and always unju&s;t, to make property the criterion of the right of voting. If the &s;um, or value
<PB N="18" REF="17">of the property upon which the right is to take place be con&s;iderable, it will exclude a majority of the people, and unite them in a common intere&s;t again&s;t the government and again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;upport it, and as the power is always with the majority, they can overturn &s;uch a government and its &s;upporters whenever they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If, in order to avoid this danger, a &s;mall quantity of property be fixed, as the criterion of the right, it exhibits liberty in di&s;grace, by putting it in competion with acci|dent and in&s;ignificance. When a brood-mare &s;hall fortu|nately produce a &s;oal or a mule, that by being worth the &s;um in que&s;tion, &s;hall convey to its owner the right of voting, or by its death take it from him, in whom does the origin of &s;uch a right exi&s;t? Is it in the man, or in the mule? When we con&s;ider how many ways property may be acquired without merit, and lo&s;t without a crime, we ought to &s;purn the idea of making it a criterion of rights.</P>
<P>But the offen&s;ive part of the ca&s;e is, that this exclu&s;ion from the right of voting implies a &s;tigma on the moral character of the per&s;ons excluded; and this is what no part of the community has a right to pronounce upon another part. No external circum&s;tance can ju&s;tify it; wealth is no proof of moral character; nor poverty of the want of it. On the contrary, wealth is often the pre&s;umptive evi|dence of di&s;hone&s;ty; and poverty the negative evidence of inuocence. If therefore property, whether little or much, be made a criterion, the means by which that pro|perty has been acquired, ought to be made a criterion al&s;o.</P>
<P>The only ground upon which exclu&s;ion from the right of voting is con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, would be to inflict it as
<PB N="19" REF="18">a puni&s;hment for a certain time upon tho&s;e who &s;hould propo&s;e to take away that right from others. The right of voting for repre&s;entatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected. To take away this right is to reduce a man to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, for &s;lavery con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;ubject to the will of another, and he that has not a vote in the election of repre&s;entatives, is in this ca&s;e. The propo&s;al therefore to disfranchi&s;e any cla&s;s of men is as criminal as the propo&s;al to take away property. When we &s;peak of right, we ought always to unite with it the idea of duties: right becomes duties by reciprocity. The right which I enjoy becomes my duty to guarantee it to another, and he to me; and tho&s;e who violate the duty ju&s;tly incur a for&s;eicure of the right.</P>
<P>In a political view of the ca&s;e the &s;trength and perma|nent &s;ecurity of government is in proportion to the num|ber of people intere&s;ted in &s;upporting it. The true policy therefore is to intere&s;t the whole by an equality or rights, for the danger ari&s;es from exclu&s;ions. It is po&s;&s;ible to exclude men from the right of voting, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to exclude them from the right of rebelling again&s;t that exclu&s;ion; and when all other rights are taken away, the right of rebellion is made perfect.</P>
<P>While men could be per&s;uaded they had no rights, or that rights appertained only to a certain cla&s;s of men, or that government was a thing exi&s;ting in right of it&s;elf, it was not difficult to govern them authoritatively. The ignorance in which they were held, and the &s;uper&s;tition in which they were in&s;tructed, furni&s;hed the means of doing
<PB N="20" REF="19">it; but when the ignorance is gone, and the &s;uper&s;tition with it; when they perceive the impo&s;ition that has been acted upon them; when they reflect that the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary means of all the wealth that exi&s;t in the world, beyond what nature &s;pon|taneou&s;ly produces; when they begin to feel their con&s;e|quence by their u&s;efulne&s;s, and their right as members of &s;ociety, it is then no longer po&s;&s;ible to govern them as before. The fraud once detected cannot be re-acted. To attempt it is to provoke deri&s;ion, or invite de&s;truction.</P>
<P>That property well ever be unequal is certain. Indu&s;try, &s;uperiority of talents, dexterity of management, extreme frugality, fortunate opportunities, or the oppo&s;ite, or the mean of tho&s;e things, will ever produce that effect without having recour&s;e to the har&s;h ill &s;ounding names of avarice, and oppre&s;&s;ion; and be&s;ide this, there are &s;ome men who, though they do not de&s;pi&s;e wealth, will not &s;toop to the drudgery or the means of acquiring it, nor will be troubled with the care of it, beyond their wants or their indepen|dence; whil&s;t in others, there is an avidity to obtain it by every means not puni&s;hable; it makes the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, and they follow it as a religion. All that is required with re&s;pect to property is to obtain it hone&s;tly, and not employ it criminally; but it is always criminally employed, when it is made a criterion for exclu&s;ive rights.</P>
<P>In in&s;titutions that are purely pecuniary, &s;uch as that of a bank or a commercial company, the rights of the members compo&s;ing that company are wholly created by the property they inve&s;t therein; and no other rights are repre&s;ented in the government of that company, than what
<PB N="21" REF="20">ari&s;e out of that property; neither has that government cognizance of <HI>any thing but prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.</HI></P>
<P>But the ca&s;e is totally different with re&s;pect to the in&s;ti|tution of civil government, organized on the &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation. Such a government has cognizance of <HI>every thing</HI> and of <HI>every man</HI> as a member of the national &s;ociety, whether he has property or not; and therefore the principle requires that <HI>every man,</HI> and <HI>every kind of right</HI> be repre&s;ented, of which the right to acquire and to hold pro|perty is but one, and that not of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential kind. The protection of a man's per&s;on is more &s;acred than the protection of property; and be&s;ides this, the faculty of performing any kind of work or &s;ervice by which he acquires a livelihood, or maintains his family, is of the nature of property. It is property to him; he has acquired; it and it is as much the object of his protection, as exterior property, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without that faculty, can be the object of protection to another per&s;on.</P>
<P>I have always believed that the be&s;t &s;ecurity for property, be it much or little, is to remove from every part of the community, as far as can po&s;&s;ibly be done, every cau&s;e of complaint, and every motive to violence: and this can only be done by an equality of rights. When rights are &s;ecure, property is &s;ecure in con&s;equence. But when property is made a pretence for unequal or exclu&s;ive rights, it weakens the right to hold the property, and provokes indignation and tumult; for it is unnatural to believe that property can be &s;ecure under the guarantee of a &s;ociety injured in its rights by the influence of that property.</P>
<P>Next to the inju&s;tice and ill-policy of making property
<PB N="22" REF="21">a pretence for exclu&s;ive rights, is the unaccountable ab&s;ur|dity of giving to mere <HI>&s;ound</HI> the idea of property, and annexing to it certain rights; for what el&s;e is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> but &s;ound. Nature is often giving to the world &s;ome extraor|dinary men who arrive at fame by merit and univer&s;al con&s;ent, &s;uch as Ari&s;totle, Socrates, Plato, &amp;c. The&s;e were truly great or noble. But when government &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts up a manufactory of nobles, it is as ab&s;urd, as if &s;he undertook to manufacture wi&s;e men. Her nobles are all counter|feits.</P>
<P>This wax-work order has a&s;&s;umed the name of ari&s;to|cracy; and the di&s;grace of it would be le&s;&s;end if it could be con&s;idered only as childi&s;h imbecility. We pardon foppery becau&s;e of its in&s;ignificance, and on the &s;ame ground we might pardon the foppery of Titles. But the origin of ari&s;tocracy was wor&s;e than foppery. It was robbery. The fir&s;t ari&s;tocrats in all countries were bri|gands. Tho&s;e of latter times, &s;ycophants.</P>
<P>It is very well known that in England, (and the &s;ame will be found in other countries) the great landed e&s;tates now held in de&s;cent were plundered from the quiet inha|bitants at the conque&s;t. The po&s;&s;ibility did not exi&s;t of acquiring &s;uch e&s;tates hone&s;tly. If it be a&s;ked how they could have been acquired no an&s;wer but that of robbery can be given. That they were not acquired by trade, by commerce, by manufactures, by agriculture, or by any re|putable employment is certain. How then were they acquir|ed? Blu&s;n ari&s;tocracy to hear your origin, for your progeni|tors were Thieves. They were the Robe&s;pierres and the Jacobins of that day. When they had committed the robbery,
<PB N="23" REF="22">they endeavoured to lo&s;e the di&s;grace of it, by &s;inking their real names under fictitious ones, which they called Titles. It is ever the practice of Felons to act in this manner. They never pa&s;s by their real names.</P>
<P>As property hone&s;tly obtained, is be&s;t &s;ecured by an equality of Rights, &s;o ill-gotten property depends for pro|tection on a monopoly of rights. He who has robbed another of his property will next endeavour to di&s;arm him of his rights, to &s;ecure that property; for when the robber becomes the legi&s;lator, he believes him&s;elf &s;ecure. That part of the government of England that is called the hou&s;e of lords, was originally compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who had com|mitted the robberies of which I have been &s;peaking. It was an a&s;&s;ociation for the protection of the property they had &s;tolen.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the criminality of the origin of ari&s;tocracy, it has an injurious effect on the moral and phy&s;ical cha|racter of man. Like &s;lavery it debilitates the human faculties; for as the mind bowed down by &s;lavery lo&s;es in &s;ilence its ela&s;tic powers, &s;o, in the contrary extreme, when it is bouyed up by folly it becomes incapable of exerting them, and dwindles into imbecility. It is im|po&s;&s;ible that a mind employed upon ribbands and titles can ever be great. The childi&s;hne&s;s of the objects con|&s;umes the man.</P>
<P>It is at all times nece&s;&s;ary, and more particularly &s;o, during the progre&s;s of a revolution, and until right ideas confirm them&s;elves by habit, that we frequently refre&s;h our patrio|ti&s;m by reference to fir&s;t principles. It is by tracing things to their origin that we learn to under&s;tand them;
<PB N="24" REF="23">and it is by keeping that line and that origin always in view, that we never forget them.</P>
<P>An enquiry into the origin of Rights will demon&s;trate to us that <HI>rights</HI> are not <HI>gifts</HI> from one man to another, nor from one cla&s;s of men to another; for who is he who could be the fir&s;t giver, or by what principles, or on what authority, could he po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of giving? A decla|ration of rights is not a creation of them, nor a donation of them. It is a manife&s;t of the principle by which they exi&s;t, followed by a detail of what the rights are; for every civil right has a natural right for its foundation, and it includes the principle of a reciprocal guarantee of tho&s;e rights from man to man. As therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any origin of rights otherwi&s;e than in the origin of man, it con&s;equently follows, that rights appertain to man in right of his exi&s;tence only, and mu&s;t therefore be equal to every man. The principle of an <HI>equality of rights</HI> is clear and &s;imple. Every man can under&s;tand it, and it is by under&s;tanding his rights that he learns his duties; for where the rights of men are equal, every man mu&s;t finally &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of protecting the rights of others as the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity for his own. But if in the forma|tion of a con&s;titution, we depart from the principle of equal rights, or attempt any modification of it, we plunge into a labyrinth of difficulties from which there is no way out, but by retreating. Where are we to &s;top? Or by what principle are we to find out the point to &s;top at, that &s;hall di&s;criminate between men of the &s;ame country, part of whom &s;hall be free, and the re&s;t not? If property is to be made the criterion, it is a total departure from every
<PB N="25" REF="24">moral principle of liberty, becau&s;e it is attaching rights to mere matter, and making man the agent of that matter. It is moreover holding up property as an apple of di&s;cord, and not only exciting but ju&s;tifying war again&s;t it; for I maintain the principle, that when property is u&s;ed as an in&s;trument to take away the rights of tho&s;e who may happen not to po&s;&s;e&s;s property, it is u&s;ed to an unlawful purpo&s;e, as fire-arms would be in a &s;imilar ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of nature all men are equal in rights, but they are not equal in power; the weak cannot protect him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;trong. This being the ca&s;e, the in&s;titution of civil &s;ociety is for the purpo&s;e of making an equaliza|tion of powers that &s;hall be parallel to, and a guarantee of the equality of rights. The laws of a country when pro|perly con&s;tructed apply to this purpo&s;e. Every man takes the arm of the law for his protection as more effectual than his own; and therefore every man has an equal right in the formation of the government and of the laws by which he is to be governed and judged. In exten&s;ive countries and &s;ocieties, &s;uch as America and France, this right, in the individual, can only be exerci&s;ed by delega|tion, that is, by election and repre&s;entation; and hence it is that the in&s;titution of repre&s;entative government ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have confined my&s;elf to matters of principle only. Fir&s;t, that hereditary government has not a right to exi&s;t; that it cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed on any principle of right; and that it is a violation of all principle. Secondly, that government by election and repre&s;entation has its origin in the natural and eternal rights of man; for whether a man be his own la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-giver, as he would be in a &s;tate of
<PB N="26" REF="25">nature; or whether he exerci&s;es his portion of legi&s;lative &s;overeignty in his own per&s;on, as might be the ca&s;e in &s;mall democraties where all could a&s;&s;emble for the forma|tion of the laws by which they were to be governed; or whe|ther he exerci&s;es it in the choice of per&s;ons to repre&s;ent him in a national a&s;&s;embly of repre&s;entatives, the origin of the right is the &s;ame in all ca&s;es. The fir&s;t, as is before ob&s;er|ved, is defective in power; the &s;econd, is practicable only in democracies of &s;mall extent; the third is the greate&s;t &s;cale upon which human government can be in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>Next to matters of <HI>principle,</HI> are matters of <HI>opinion,</HI> and it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the two. Whether the rights of men &s;hall be equal is not a matter of opinion but of right, and con&s;equently of principle; for men do not hold their rights as grants from each other, but each one in right of him&s;elf. Society is the guardian but not the giver. And as in exten&s;ive &s;ocieties, &s;uch as America and France, the right of the individual, in matters of govern|ment, cannot be exerci&s;ed but by election and repre&s;enta|tion; it con&s;equently follows, that the only &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, con&s;i&s;tent with principle, where &s;imple democracy is impracticable, is the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem. But as to the organical part, or the manner in which the &s;everal parts of government &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l be arranged and compo&s;ed, it is alto|gether <HI>matter of opinion.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary that all the parts be conformable with the <HI>principle of equal rights;</HI> and &s;o long as this principle be religiou&s;ly adhered to, no very material error can take place&punc; neither can any error continue long, in that part that falls within the province of opinion.</P>
<P>In all matters of opinion, the &s;ocial compact, or the
<PB N="27" REF="26">principle by which &s;ociety is held together, requires that the majority of opinions becomes the rule for the whole, and that the minority yields practical obedience thereto. This is perfectly conformable to the principle of equal rights: for, in the fir&s;t place, every man has a <HI>right to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve an opinion,</HI> but no man has a right that his opinion &s;hould <HI>govern the re&s;t.</HI> In the &s;econd place, it is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be known before hand on which &s;ide of any que&s;tion, whe|ther for or again&s;t, any man's opinion will fall. He may happen to be in a majority upon &s;ome que&s;tions, and in a minority upon others; and by the &s;ame rule that he expects obedience in the one ca&s;e, he mu&s;t yield it in the other. &mdash;All the di&s;orders that have ari&s;en in France during the progre&s;s of the revolution have had their origin, not in the <HI>principle of equal rights,</HI> but in the violation of that principle. The principle of equal rights has been repeat|edly violated, and that not by the majority but by the minority, and <HI>that minority has been compo&s;ed of men po&s;&s;i&s;&s;ing property as well as of men without property; property therefore, even upon the experience already had, is no more a criterion of character than it is of rights.</HI> It will &s;ometimes happen that the minority are right, and the majority are wrong, but as &s;oon as experience proves this to be the ca&s;e, the minority will increa&s;e to a majority, and the error will reform it&s;elf by the tranquil operation of freedom of opinion and equality of rights. Nothing therefore can ju&s;tify an in&s;urrection, neither can it ever be nece&s;&s;ary, where rights are equal and opinions free.</P>
<P>Taking then the principle of equal rights as the &s;oun|dation of the revolution, and con&s;equently of the con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="28" REF="27">the organical part, or the manner in which the &s;everal parts of the government &s;hall be arranged in the con&s;titu|tion, will, as is already &s;aid, fall within the province of opinion.</P>
<P>Various methods will pre&s;ent them&s;elves upon a que&s;tion of this kind, and tho' experience is yet wanting to deter|mine which is the be&s;t, it has, I think, &s;ufficiently decided which is the wor&s;t. That is the wor&s;t, which in its deli|berations and deci&s;ions is &s;ubject to the precipitancy and pa&s;&s;ion of an individual; and when the whole legi&s;lature is crouded into one body, it is an individual in ma&s;s. In all ca&s;es of deliberation it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a crops of re&s;erve, and it would be better to divide the repre&s;entation by lot into two parts, and let them revi&s;e and correct each other, than that the whole &s;hould &s;it together and debate at once.</P>
<P>Repre&s;entative government is not nece&s;&s;arily confined to any one particular form. The principle is the &s;ame in all the forms under which it can be arranged. The equal rights of the people is the root from which the whole &s;prings, and the branches may be arranged as pre&s;ent opi|nion or future experience &s;hall be&s;t direct. As to that <HI>ho&s;pital of incurables</HI> (as Che&s;terfield calls it) the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of peers, it is an excre&s;&s;ence growing out of corrup|tion; and there is no more affinity or re&s;emblance between any of the branches of a legi&s;lative body originating from the rights of the people, and the afore&s;aid hou&s;e of peers, than between a regular member of the human body and an ulcerated wen.</P>
<P>As to that part of government that is called the
<PB N="29" REF="28"><HI>executive,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to fix a preci&s;e meaning to the word.</P>
<P>There are but two divi&s;ions into which power can be arranged. Fir&s;t, that of willing or decreeing the laws; &s;econdly, that of executing or putting them in practice. The former, corre&s;ponds to the intellectual faculties of the human mind, which rea&s;ons and determines what &s;hall be done; the &s;econd, to the mechanical powers of the human body that puts that determination into practice. If the former decides, and the latter does not perform, it is a &s;tate of imbecility; and if the latter acts without the predetermination of the former, it is a &s;tate of lunacy. The executive department therefore is official, and is &s;ubordinate to the legi&s;lative, as the body is to the mind in a &s;tate of health; for, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the idea of two &s;overeignties, a &s;overeignty to <HI>will,</HI> and a &s;overeignty to <HI>act.</HI> The executive is not inve&s;ted with the power of deliberating whether it &s;hall act or not; it has no di&s;cretionary authority in the ca&s;e; for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can <HI>act no other thing</HI> that what the laws decree, and it is <HI>obliged</HI> to act conformably thereto; and in this view of the ca&s;e, the executive is made up of all the official departments that execute the laws, of which, that which is called the judi|ciary is the chief.</P>
<P>But mankind have conceived an idea that <HI>&s;ome kind of authority</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>&s;uperintend</HI> the execution of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws, and to &s;ee that they are faithfully performed; and it is by confounding this &s;uperintending authority with the official execution that we get embarra&s;&s;ed about the term <HI>executive power.</HI> &mdash; All the parts in the governments of the
<PB N="30" REF="29">united &s;tates of America that are called THE EXECUTIVE, are no other than authorities to &s;uperintend the execution of the laws; and they are &s;o far independent of the legi&s;la|tive, that they know the legi&s;lative only thro' the laws, and cannot be controuled or directed by it, through any other medium.</P>
<P>In what manner this &s;uperintending authority &s;hall be appointed or compo&s;ed, is a matter that falls within the province of opinion. Some may prefer one method and &s;ome another; and in all ca&s;es, where opinion only and not principle is concerned, the majority of opinions forms the rule for all. There are however &s;ome things deducible from rea&s;on, and evidenced by experience, that &s;erve to guide our deci&s;ion upon the ca&s;e. The one is, never to inve&s;t any individual with extraordinary power; for be&s;ides his being tempted to mi&s;u&s;e it, it will excite contention and commotion in the nation for the office. Secondly, never to inve&s;t power long in the hands of any number of indi|viduals. The inconveniences that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ac|company frequent changes, are le&s;s to be feared than the danger that a ri&s;es from long continuance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with offering &s;ome ob&s;er|vations on the means of <HI>pre&s;erving liberty;</HI> for it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that we e&s;tabli&s;h it, but that we pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>It is, in the fir&s;t place, nece&s;&s;ary that we di&s;tingui&s;h between the means made u&s;e of to overthrow de&s;poti&s;m, in order to prepare the way for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty, and the means to be u&s;ed after the de&s;poti&s;m is over thrown.</P>
<P>The means made u&s;e of in the fir&s;t ca&s;e are ju&s;tified by
<PB N="31" REF="30">nece&s;&s;ity. Tho&s;e means are in general in&s;urrections; for whil&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of de&s;poti&s;m continues in any country it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that any other means can be u&s;ed. It is al&s;o certain that in the commencement of a revolution, the revolutionary party permit to them|&s;elves a <HI>di&s;cretionary exerci&s;e of power</HI> regulated more by circum&s;tances than by principle, which were the practice to continue, liberty would never be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or if e&s;ta|bli&s;hed would &s;oon be overthrown. It is never to be expected in a revolution that every man is to change his opinion at the &s;ame mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt. There never yet was any truth or any principle &s;o irr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i&s;tibly obvious, that all men believed it at once. Time and rea&s;on mu&s;t co-operate with each other to the final e&s;tabli&s;hment of any principle; and therefore tho&s;e who may happen to be fir&s;t convinced have not a right to per&s;ecute others, on whom conviction operates more &s;lowly. The moral principle of revolutions is to in&s;truct; not to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Had a con&s;titution been e&s;tabli&s;hed two years ago (as ought to have been done) the violences that have &s;ince de&s;olated France, and injured the character of the revolu|tion, would, in my opinion, have been prevented. The na|tion would then have had a bond of union, and every indi|vidual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow. But in&s;tead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either principle or authority, was &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in its place; virtue and crime depended upon acci|dent; and that which was patrioti&s;m one day became trea&s;on the next. All the&s;e things have followed from the want of a con&s;titution; for it is the nature and intention
<PB N="32" REF="31">of a con&s;titution to <HI>prevent governing by party,</HI> by e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a common principle that &s;hall limit and controul the power and impul&s;e of party, and that &s;ays to all parties, THUS FAR SHALT THOU GO AND NO FURTHER. But in the ab&s;ence of a con&s;titution men look entirely to party; and in&s;tead of principle governing party, party governs principle.</P>
<P>An avidity to puni&s;h is always dangerous to liberty. It leads men to &s;tretch, to mi&s;interpret, and to mi&s;apply even the be&s;t of laws. He that would make his own liberty &s;ecure, mu&s;t guard even his enemy from oppre&s;&s;ion; for if he violates this duty, he e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent that will reach to him&s;elf.</P>

<PB REF="32">
<HEAD><HI>SPEECH OF THOMAS PAINE,</HI> As delivered in the Convention, July <HI>7, 1795.</HI> Wherein he alludes to the preceding Work.</HEAD>
<P>ON the motion of Lanthenas. "That permi&s;&s;ion be granted to Thomas Paine, to deliver his &s;en|timents on the Declaration of Rights and the Con&s;ti|tution, Thomas Paine a&s;cended the Tribune; and no oppo&s;ition being made to the motion, one of the Se|cretaries, who &s;tood by Mr. Paine, read his &s;peech, of which the following is a literal tran&s;lation:</P>
<P>CITIZENS,</P>
<P>The effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted during a rigorous confinement in the Luxem|bourg, have thus long prevented me from attending at my po&s;t in the bo&s;om of the Convention, and the mag|nitude of the &s;ubject under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and no other con&s;ideration on earth, could induce me now to repair to my &s;tation.</P>
<P>A recurrence to the vici&s;&s;itudes I have experienced, and the critical &s;ituations in which I have been placed in con|&s;equence of the French Revolution, will throw upon what I now propo&s;e to &s;ubmit to the Convention, the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the recti|tude of tho&s;e principles which have uniformly influenced my conduct.</P>
<P>In England I was pro&s;cribed for having vindicated the French Revolution, and I have &s;uffered a rigorous impri&s;onment in France for having pur&s;ued a &s;imilar
<PB N="34" REF="33">mode of conduct. During the reign of terrori&s;m, I was a clo&s;e pri&s;oner for eight long months, and remained &s;o above three months after the aera of the 10th Thermidor. I ought, however, to &s;cate, that I was not per&s;ecuted by the <HI>people</HI> either of England or France. The proceedings in both countries were the effects of the de&s;poti&s;m exi&s;t|ing in their re&s;pective governments. But, even if my per&s;ecution had originated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would &s;till have remained the &s;ame. Principles which are influenced and &s;ubject to the controul of tyranny have not their foundation in the heart.</P>
<P>A few days ago I tran&s;mitted to you, by the ordinary mode of di&s;tribution, a &s;hort Treati&s;e, entitled "Di&s;&s;er|tation on the Fir&s;t Principles of Government." This little work I did intend to have dedicated to the people of Holland, who, about the time I began to write it, were determined to accompli&s;h a Revolution in their Government,&mdash;rather than to the people of France, who had long before effected that glorious object. But there are, in the Con&s;titution which is about to be ratified by the Convention, certain articles, and in the report which preceded it, certain points, &s;o repugnant to rea|&s;on, and incompatible with the true principles of li|berty, as to render this Treati&s;e, drawn up for another purpo&s;e, applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and under this impre&s;&s;ion I pre&s;umed to &s;ubmit it to your con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>If there be faults in the Con&s;titution, it were better to expunge them now, than to abide the event of their mi&s;chievous tendency; for certain it is, that the plan of the Con&s;titution which has been pre&s;ented to you is not con&s;i&s;tent with the grand object of the Revolution, nor congenial to the &s;entiments of the individuals who accompli&s;hed it.</P>
<P>To deprive half the people in a nation of their rights as citizens, is an ea&s;y matter in theory or on paper: but it is a mo&s;t dangerous experiment, and rarely practica|ble in the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">I &s;hall now proceed to the ob&s;ervations I have to offer on this important &s;ubject; and I pledge my&s;elf that they &s;hall be neither numerous nor diffu&s;ive.</P>
<P>In my apprehen&s;ion, a con&s;titution embraces two di&s;tinct parts or objects, the <HI>Principle</HI> and the <HI>Practice;</HI> and it is not only an e&s;&s;ential, but an indi&s;pen&s;able provi&s;ion, that the practice &s;hould emanate from, and accord with the principle. Now I maintain, that the conver&s;e of this propo&s;ition is the ca&s;e in the plan of the Con&s;titution under di&s;cu&s;tion. The fir&s;t article, for in&s;tance, of the POLITICAL STATE of Citizens, (v. TITLE II. OF THE CONSTITUTION) &s;ays,</P>
<P>"Every man born and re&s;ident in France, who, be|ing twenty-one years of age, has in&s;cribed his name on the Civic Regi&s;ter of his Canton, and who has liv|ed afterwards one year on the territory of the Repub|lic, and who pays any direct contribution what&s;oever, real or per&s;onal, is a French citizen."</P>
<P>I might here a&s;k, if tho&s;e only who come under the above de&s;cription are to be con&s;idered as citizens, what de&s;ignation do you mean to give the re&s;t of the people? I allude to that portion of the people on whom the principal part of the labour falls, and on whom the weight of indirect taxation will in the event chiefly pre&s;s. In the &s;tructure of the &s;ocial fabric, this cla&s;s of people are in&s;initely &s;uperior to that privileged order, who&s;e only qualification is their wealth or territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. For what is trade without merchants? What is land without cultivation? And what is the produce of the land without manufacturers? But to re|turn to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, this article is incompatible with the three fir&s;t articles of the Declaration of Rights, which precede the Con&s;titutional Act.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article of the Declaration of Rights &s;ays:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The end of &s;ociety is the public good; and the in&s;titution of government is to &s;ecure to every individual the enjoyment of his rights."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">But the article of the Con&s;titution to which I have ju&s;t adverted propo&s;es as the object of &s;ociety, not the public good, or in other words, the good of <HI>all,</HI> but a partial good, or the good only of a <HI>few;</HI> and the Con&s;titution provides &s;olely for the rights of this few, to the exclu&s;ion of the many.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article of the Declaration of Rights &s;ays:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Rights of Man in &s;ociety are Liberty, Equa|lity, Security of his per&s;on and property."</P>
<P>But the article alluded to in the Con&s;titution has a direct tendency to e&s;tabli&s;h the conver&s;e of this po&s;i|tion, ina&s;much as the per&s;ons excluded by this <HI>inequa|lity</HI> can neither be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s liberty, nor &s;ecurity again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion. They are con&s;igned totally to the caprice and tyranny of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The third article of the Declaration of Rights &s;ays:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch acts of volition, as are not injurious to others."</P>
<P>But the article of the Con&s;titution, on which I have ob&s;erved, breaks down this barrier. It enables the liberty of one part of &s;ociety to de&s;troy the freedom of the other.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out the incon&s;i&s;tency of this article to the Declaration of Rights, I &s;hall proceed to comment on that part of the &s;ame article which makes a direct contribution a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to the right of citizen&s;hip.</P>
<P>A modern refinement on the object of public revenue has divided the taxes or contributions into two cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>direct</HI> and the <HI>indirect,</HI> without being able to define preci&s;ely the di&s;tinction, or difference between them, becau&s;e the effect of both is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are de&s;ignated indirect taxes which fall upon the con&s;umers of certain articles, on which the tax is impo&s;ed, becau&s;e the tax being included in the price, the con&s;umer pays it without taking notice of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to the territorial tax. The land proprietors, in order to reimbur&s;e them|&s;elves,
<PB N="37" REF="36">will rack-rent their tenants: the farmer, of cour&s;e, will transfer the obligation to the miller, by enhancing the price of grain; the miller to the baker, by increa&s;ing the price of flour; and the baker to the con&s;umer, by rai&s;ing the price of bread. The territo|rial tax, therefore, though called <HI>direct,</HI> is in its con|&s;equences <HI>indirect.</HI></P>
<P>To this tax the land proprietor contributes only in proportion to the quantity of bread and other provi|&s;ions that are con&s;umed in his own family. The deficit is furni&s;hed by the great ma&s;s of the community, which comprehends every individual of the nation.</P>
<P>From the logical di&s;tinction between the direct and indirect taxation, &s;ome emolument may re&s;ult, I allow, to auditors of public accounts, &amp;c. but to the people at large I deny that &s;uch a di&s;tinction (which by the by is without a difference) can be productive of any practical benefit. It ought not, therefore, to be admitted as a principle in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this objection, the provi&s;ion in que&s;tion does not affect to define, &s;ecure, or e&s;tabli&s;h the right of citi|zen&s;hip. It con&s;igns to the caprice or di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature the power of pronouncing who &s;hall, or &s;hall not, exerci&s;e the functions of a citizen; and this may be done effectually, either by the impo&s;ition of a <HI>direct</HI> or <HI>indirect</HI> tax, according to the &s;elfi&s;h views of the le|gi&s;lators, or by the mode of collecting the taxes &s;o im|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Neither a tenant who occupies an exten&s;ive farm, nor a merchant or manufacturer, who may have embarked a large capital in their re&s;pective pur&s;uits, can ever, according to this &s;y&s;tem, attain the pre-emption of a citizen. On the other hand, any up&s;tart, who has by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or management, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a few acres of land, or a mi&s;erable tenement, may exultingly exer|ci&s;e the functions of a citizen, although perhaps he neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a hundredth part of the worth or pro|perty of a &s;imple mechanic, nor contributes in any pro|portion to the exigencies of the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">The contempt in which the old government held mercantile pur&s;uits, and the obliquy that attached on merchants and manufacturers, contributed not a little to its embarra&s;&s;ments, and its eventual &s;ubver&s;ion; and, &s;trange to tell, though the mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from this mode of conduct are &s;o obvious, yet an article is pro|po&s;ed for your adoption, which has a manife&s;t ten|dency to re&s;tore a defect inherent in the monarchy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the &s;econd article of the &s;ame title, with which I &s;hall conclude my remarks.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article &s;ays, "Every French &s;oldier, who &s;hall have &s;erved one or more campaigns in the cau&s;e of liberty, is deemed a citizen of the Republic, without any re&s;pect or reference to other qualifications."</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, that in this Article, the Committee were de&s;irous of extricating them&s;elves from a dilemma into which they had been plunged by the preceding article. When men depart from an e&s;tabli&s;hed princi|ple, they are compelled to re&s;ort to trick and &s;ubter|fuge, always &s;hifting their means to pre&s;erve the uni|ty of their objects; and as it rarely happens that the fir&s;t expedient makes amends for the pro&s;titution of principle, they mu&s;t call in aid a &s;econd of a more fla|grant nature to &s;upply the deficiency of the former. In this manner legi&s;lators go on accumulating error upon error, and artifice upon artifice, until the ma&s;s becomes &s;o bulky and incongruous, and their embarra&s;&s;ment &s;o de&s;perate, that they are compelled, as their la&s;t expe|dient, to re&s;ort to the very principle they had vio|lated.&mdash;The Committee were preci&s;ely in this predi|cament, when they framed this article; and to me, I confe&s;s, their conduct appears &s;pecious rather than effi|cacious.</P>
<P>It was not for him&s;elf alone, but for his family, that the French citizen, at the dawn of the revolution (for then indeed every man was con&s;idered a citizen) marched &s;oldier-like to the frontiers, and repelled a foreign in|va&s;ion. He had it not in his contemplation, that he &s;hould enjoy liberty for the re&s;idue of his earthly ca|reer
<PB N="39" REF="38">and by his own act preclude his off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. No! I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> wi&s;hed to leave it as an inheritance to his children, and that they might hand it down to their late&s;t po&s;terity. If a Frenchman, who united in his per&s;on the character of a Soldier and a Citizen, was now to return from the army to his peaceful habitation, he mu&s;t addre&s;s his &s;mall family in this manner:</P>
<P>"Sorry I am, that I cannot leave to you a &s;mall por|tion of what I have acquired by expo&s;ing my per&s;on to the ferocity of our enemies, and defeating their machi|nations. I have e&s;tabli&s;hed the republic, and, painful the reflection, all the laurels I have won in the field are bla&s;ted, and all the privileges to which my exertions have entitled me, extend not beyond the period of my own exi&s;tence!" Thus the mea&s;ure that has been adopted by way of &s;ubterfuge, falls &s;hort of what the framers of it &s;peculated upon; for in conciliating the affections of the <HI>Soldier,</HI> they have &s;ubjected the <HI>Father</HI> to the mo&s;t pungent &s;en&s;ations, by obliging him to adopt a generation of Slaves.</P>
<P>Citizens, a great deal has been urged re&s;pecting in&s;urrections. I am confident no man has a greater ab|horrence of them than my&s;elf, and I am &s;orry that any in&s;inuations &s;hould have been thrown out upon me as a promoter of violence of any kind. The whole tenor of my life and conver&s;ation gives the lie to tho&s;e calumnies, and proves me to be a friend to order, truth and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I hope you will attribute this effu&s;ion of my &s;enti|ments to my anxiety for the honor and &s;ucce&s;s of the revolution. I have no intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that which has a tendency to meliorate the &s;ituation of mankind. The revolution, as far as it re&s;pects my&s;elf, has been productive of more lo&s;s and per&s;ecution than it is po&s;|&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe, or for you to indemnify. But with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, I could not refrain from declaring my &s;entiments.</P>
<P>In my opinion, if you &s;ubvert the ba&s;is of the revo|lution,
<PB N="40" REF="39" MS="y">if you di&s;pen&s;e with principles, and &s;ub&s;titute expedients, you will extingui&s;h that enthu&s;ia&s;in and energy which have hitherto been the life and &s;oul of the revolution; and you will &s;ub&s;titute in its place nothing but a cold indifference and &s;elf-intere&s;t, which will again degenerate into intrigue, cunning, and effeminacy.</P>
<P>But to di&s;card all con&s;iderations of a per&s;onal and &s;ubordinate nature, it is e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of the republic, that the practical or organic part of the con&s;titution &s;hould corre&s;pond with its principles; and as this does not appear to be the ca&s;e in the plan that has been pre&s;ented to you, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the revi&s;ion of a com|mittee, who &s;hould be in&s;tructed to compare it with the Declaration of Rights, in order to a&s;certain the differ|ence between the two, and to make &s;uch alterations as &s;hall render them perfectly con&s;i&s;tent and compatible with each other.</P>
