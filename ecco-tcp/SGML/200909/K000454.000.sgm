<P>'_TWAS my Fortune, my Lord, in my ju|venile Years, <HI>Mu&s;as cum Marte commutare,</HI> and truly I have Rea&s;on to blu&s;h, when I con&s;ider the &s;mall Advantage I have reap'd from that Change. But le&s;t
<PB REF="3">
it &s;hould be imputed to my Want of Merit, I have wrote the&s;e Memoirs, and leave the World to judge of my De&s;erts. They are not &s;et forth by any fictitious Stories, nor imbe|li&s;hed with rhetorical Flou|ri&s;hes; plain Truth is certainly mo&s;t becoming the Character of an old Soldier. Yet let them be never &s;o meritorious, if not protected by &s;ome noble Patron, &s;ome Per&s;ons may think them to be of no Value.</P>
<P>To you therefore, my Lord, I pre&s;ent them; to you, who have &s;o eminently di&s;hingui&s;h|ed your &s;elf, and who&s;e Wi&s;|dom has been &s;o con&s;picuous to the late Repre&s;entatives of

<HI>Great Britain,</HI> that each re|volving Age will &s;peak in your Prai&s;e; and if you vouch&s;afe to be the <HI>Mecaenas</HI> of the&s;e Memoirs, your Name will give them &s;ufficient San|ction.</P>
<P>An old Soldier I may truly call my &s;elf, and my Family allows me the Title of a Gentleman; yet I have &s;een many Favourites of Fortune, without being able to di&s;cern why they &s;hould be &s;o happy, and my &s;elf &s;o unfortunate; but let not that di&s;courage your Lord&s;hip from receiving the&s;e my Memoirs into your Patronage; for the Unhappy cannot expect Favour but
<PB REF="5">
from tho&s;e who are endued with generous Souls.</P>
<P>Give me Leave, my Lord, to congratulate this good For|tune, that neither Whig nor Tory (in this complaining Age) have found fault with your Conduct. Your Fami|ly has produced Heroes, in defence of injured Kings; and you, when 'twas nece&s;&s;ary, have as nobly adher'd to the Cau&s;e of Liberty.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the&s;e Memoirs began early to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in mar|tial Affairs, otherwi&s;e he could not have &s;een &s;uck Variety of Actions both by Sea and Land. After the la&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> War he went into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he not only &s;erv'd under the Command of his High|ne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> whil&s;t he was Generali&s;&s;imo of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces, but likewi&s;e all the time he reign'd King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages and Events, which happened during that time, are contained in the for|mer Part of this Book.</P>
<P>In the Year 1705. the Regiment in which he &s;erv'd as Captain was order'd to embark for the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> and he, having no, In|clination to go thither, chang'd with an half-pay Captain; and being recommended to the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> by the late Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> went with him upon that noble Expedition into <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When the Forces under his Lord&s;hip's Command were landed near <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Siege of that Place was thought by &s;everal impracticable, not only for want of expe|rienc'd
<PB REF="7">
Engineers, but that the Be&s;ieged were as numerous as the Be&s;iegers; yet the Courage of that brave Earl &s;urmounted tho&s;e Difficulties, and the Siege was re&s;olv'd upon.</P>
<P>Our Author having obtain'd, by his long Service, &s;ome Knowledge of the practick Part of an Engineer, and &s;eeing at that cri|tical Time the great Want of &s;uch, readily acted as one, which gave him the greater Opportunity of being an Eye-Witne&s;s of his Lord&s;hip's Actions; and con&s;equently made him capable of &s;etting them forth in the&s;e his Memoirs.</P>
<P>It may not be perhaps improper to mention that the Author of the&s;e Memoirs was born at <HI>Ewelme</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> de&s;cended from an ancient and an honourable Family. The Lord <HI>Dudley Carleton,</HI> who died Secretary of State to King <HI>Charles I.</HI> was his Great Uncle; and in the &s;ame Reign his Father was Envoy at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> whil&s;t his Uncle, Sir <HI>Dudley Carleton,</HI> was Em|ba&s;&s;ador to the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> Men in tho&s;e Days re&s;pected both for their Abilities and Loyalty.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF AN <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the Year one Thou&s;and &s;ix Hundred &s;eventy two, War being proclaimed with <HI>Hol|land,</HI> it was looked upon, among Nobility and Gentry, as a Blemi&s;h, not to attend the Duke of <HI>York</HI> aboard the Fleet, who was then de|clared Admiral. With many others, I, at that Time about twenty Years of Age, en|ter'd my &s;elf a Voluntier on board the <HI>London,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>Edward Sprage,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Red.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fleet &s;et Sail from the <HI>Buoy of the Nore</HI> about the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> in order to join the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, then at Anchor in St. <HI>Hellen</HI>'s <HI>Road,</HI> under the Command of
<PB N="2" REF="9">
the <HI>Count de E&s;tr&eacute;e.</HI> But in executing this De&s;ign we had a very narrow E&s;cape: For <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> the Admiral of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, having Notice of our Intentions, waited to have intercepted us at the Mouth of the River, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a great Fog we pa&s;s'd <HI>Dover</HI> before he was aware of it; and thus he mi&s;carried, with the poor Advantage of taking only one &s;mall Tender.</P>
<P>A DAY or two after the joining of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> we &s;ailed directly to|wards the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;t, where we &s;oon got &s;ight of their Fleet; a Sand called the <HI>Galloper</HI> lying between. The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;eem'd willing there to expect an Attack from us: But in regard the <HI>Charles</HI> Man of War had been lo&s;t on tho&s;e Sands the War before; and that our Ships drawing more Water than tho&s;e of the Enemy, an Engagement might be render'd very di&s;ad|vantagious; it was re&s;olv'd in a Council of War to avoid coming to a Battle for the pre&s;ent, and to &s;ail directly for <HI>Solebay,</HI> which was accordingly put in Execution.</P>
<P>WE had not been in <HI>Solebay</HI> above four or five Days, when <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> hearing of it, made his Signal for &s;ailing in order to &s;urprize us; and he had certainly had his Aim, had there been any Breeze of Wind to favour him. But though they made u&s;e of all their Sails, there was &s;o little Air &s;tir|ring,
<PB N="3" REF="10">
that we could &s;ee their Fleet making towards us long before they came up; not|with&s;tanding which, our Admirals found difficulty enough to form their Ships into a Line of Battle, &s;o as to be ready to receive the Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets en|gag'd in <HI>Solebay.</HI></NOTE>IT was about Four in the Morning of the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> being <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> in <HI>Whit&s;on Week,</HI> when we fir&s;t made the Di&s;covery; and about Eight the &s;ame Morning the Blue Squadron, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> began to engage with Admiral <HI>Van Ghent,</HI> who command|ed the <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Squadron; and about Nine the whole Fleets were under a general Engagement. The Fight la&s;ted till Ten at Night, and with equal Fury on all Sides, the <HI>French</HI> excepted, who appeared &s;tation|ed there rather as Spectators than Parties; and as unwilling to be too much upon the Offen&s;ive, for fear of offending them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>DURING the Fight the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admi|ral had two Ships di&s;abled under him; and was obliged about Four in the Afternoon to remove him&s;elf a third Time into the <HI>London,</HI> where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> remain'd all the re&s;t of the Fight, and till next Morning. Never|thele&s;s, on his Entrance upon the <HI>London,</HI> which was the Ship I was in and on our Hoi&s;ting the Standard, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and his Squadron &s;eem'd to double their Fire upon
<PB N="4" REF="11">
her, as if they re&s;olv'd to blow her out of the Water. Notwith&s;tanding all which, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> remain'd all the time up|on Quarter Deck, and as the Bullets plenti|fully whizz'd around him, would often rub his Hands, and cry, <HI>Sprage, Sprage, they follow us &s;till.</HI> I am very &s;en&s;ible later Times have not been over favourable in their Sen|timents of that unfortunate Prince's Valour, yet I cannot omit the doing a Piece of Ju|&s;tice to his Memory, in relating a Matter of Fact, of which my own Eyes were Wit|ne&s;&s;es, and &s;aying, That if Intrepidity, and Undauntedne&s;s, may be reckon'd any Parts of Courage, no Man in the Fleet better de|&s;erv'd the Title of Couragious, or behav'd him&s;elf with more Gallantry than he did.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;t the <HI>Royal James,</HI> commanded by the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> which about Twelve (after the &s;trenuous Endeavours of her Sailors to di&s;engage her from two <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire Ships plac'd on her, one athwart her Haw&s;ers, the other on her Star-board Side) took Fire, blew up, and peri&s;h'd; and with her a great many brave Gentlemen, as well as Sailors; and among&s;t the re&s;t the Earl him&s;elf, concerning whom I &s;hall further add, that in my Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Harwich</HI> to the <HI>Brill,</HI> a Year or two af|ter, the Ma&s;ter of the Pacquet Boat told me, That having ob&s;erv'd a great Flock of Gulls hovering in one particular Part of
<PB N="5" REF="12">
the Sea, he order'd his Boat to make up to it; when di&s;covering a Corp&s;e, the Sailors would have return'd it to the Sea, as the Corp&s;e of a <HI>Dutch Man</HI>; but keeping it in his Boat, it proved to be that of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich.</HI> There was found about him between twenty and thirty Gui|neas, &s;ome Silver, and his Gold Watch; re&s;toring which to his Lady, &s;he kept the Watch, but rewarded their Hone&s;ty with all the Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>THIS was the only Ship the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;t in this long Engagement. For although the <HI>Katherine</HI> was taken, and her Com|mander, Sir <HI>John Chicheley,</HI> made Pri&s;o|ner, her Sailors &s;oon after finding the Op|portunity they had watch'd for, &s;eiz'd all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailors, who had been put in upon them, and brought the Ship back to our own Fleet, together with all the <HI>Dutch Men</HI> Pri&s;oners; for which, as they de&s;erv'd, they were well rewarded. This is the &s;ame Ship which the Earl of <HI>Mul|grave</HI> (afterwards Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>) commanded the next Sea Fight, and has caus'd to be painted in his Hou&s;e in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not omit one very remark|able Occurrence which happened in this Ship, There was a Gentleman aboard her, a Voluntier, of a very fine E&s;tate, general|ly known by the Name of <HI>Hodge Vaughan.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
This Per&s;on receiv'd, in the beginning of the Fight, a con&s;iderable Wound, which the great Confu&s;ion, during the Battle, would not give them leave to inquire into; &s;o he was carried out of the Way, and di&s;|po&s;ed of in the Hold. They had &s;ome Hogs aboard, which the Sailor, under who&s;e Care they were, had neglected to feed; the&s;e Hogs, hungry as they were, found out, and fell upon the wounded Per|&s;on, and between dead and alive eat him up to his very Scull, which, after the Fight was over, and the Ship retaken, as before, was all that could be found of him.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Thing, le&s;s to be account|ed for, happen'd to a Gentleman Voluntier who was aboard the &s;ame Ship with my &s;elf. He was of known per&s;onal Courage, in the vulgar Notion of it, his Sword ne|ver having fail'd him in many private Duels. But notwith&s;tanding all his Land|mettle, it was ob&s;erv'd of him at Sea, that when ever the Bullets whizz'd over his Head, or any way incommoded his Ears, he immediately quitted the Deck, and ran down into the Hold. At fir&s;t he was gently reproach'd; but after many Repeti|tions he was laugh'd at, and began to be de&s;pis'd; &s;en&s;ible of which, as a Te&s;timo|nial of his Valour, he made it his Reque&s;t to be ty'd to the Main Ma&s;t. But had it
<PB N="7" REF="14">
been granted him, I cannot &s;ee any Title he could have pleaded from hence, to true Magnanimity; &s;ince to be ty'd from run|ning away can import nothing le&s;s, than that he would have &s;till continued the&s;e Signs of Cowardice, if he had not been pre|vented. There is a Bravery of Mind which I fan&s;y few of tho&s;e Gentlemen Duelli&s;ts are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. True Courage cannot proceed from what Sir <HI>Walter Ra|leigh</HI> finely calls <HI>the Art</HI> or <HI>Philo&s;ophy of Quarrel.</HI> No! It mu&s;t be the I&s;&s;ue of Principle, and can have no other Ba&s;is than a &s;teady Tenet of Religion. This will appear more plain, if tho&s;e Arti&s;ts in Murder will give them&s;elves leave cooly to con&s;ider, and an&s;wer me this Que&s;tion, Why he that had ran &s;o many Ri&s;ques at his Sword's Point, &s;hould be &s;o &s;hamefully intimidated at the Whiz of a Cannon Ball?</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD>The Names of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen who lo&s;t their Lives, as I remember, in this Engagement.</HEAD>
<ITEM>COMMISSIONER <HI>Cox,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Royal Prince,</HI> under the Command of the Admiral; and Mr. <HI>Travanian,</HI> Gentleman to the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; Mr. <HI>Digby,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Henry,</HI> &s;econd Son to the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; Sir <HI>Fletchvile Hollis,</HI> Captain of
<PB N="8" REF="15">
the <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who lo&s;t one of his Arms in the War before, and his Life in this; Captain <HI>Saddleton,</HI> of the <HI>Dartmouth</HI>; the Lord <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> a Voluntier on board the <HI>Charles,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>John Harman,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the Red.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SIR <HI>Philip Carteret,</HI> Mr. <HI>Herbert,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotterel,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peyton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Go&s;e,</HI> with &s;e|veral other Gentlemen unknown to me, lo&s;t their Lives with the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> on board the <HI>Royal James</HI>; Mr. <HI>Vaughan,</HI> on board the <HI>Katherine,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>John Chicheley.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IN this Engagement, Sir <HI>George Rook</HI> was younge&s;t Lieutenant to Sir <HI>Edward Sprage</HI>; Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Orford,</HI> was Captain of a &s;mall Fifth Rate, called the <HI>Phoenix</HI>; Mr. <HI>Herbert,</HI> after|wards Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> was Captain of a &s;mall Fourth Rate, called the <HI>Monck</HI>; Sir <HI>Harry Dutton Colt,</HI> who was on board the <HI>Victory,</HI> commanded by the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ry,</HI> is the only Man now living that I can remember was in this Engagement.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>BUT to proceed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had one Man of War &s;unk, though &s;o near the Shore, that I &s;aw &s;ome part of her Main Ma&s;t remain above Water; with their Admiral <HI>Van Ghent,</HI> who was &s;lain in the clo&s;e Engagement with the Earl of
<PB N="9" REF="16">
<HI>Sandwich.</HI> This Engagement la&s;ted four|teen Hours, and was look'd upon the greate&s;t that ever was fought between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Hollander.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT here omit one Thing, which to &s;ome may &s;eem trifling; though I am apt to think our Naturali&s;ts may have a diffe|rent Opinion of it, and find it afford their Fan&s;ies no undiverting Employment in more curious, and le&s;s perilous Reflections. We had on board the <HI>London,</HI> where, as I have &s;aid, I was a Voluntier, a great Number of Pidgeons, of which our Com|mander was very fond. The&s;e, on the fir&s;t firing of our Cannon, di&s;pers'd, and flew away, and were &s;een no where near us during the Fight. The next Day it blew a brisk Gale, and drove our Fleet &s;ome Leagues to the Southward of the Place where they for&s;ook our Ship, yet the Day after they all returned &s;afe aboard; not in one Flock, but in &s;mall Parties of four or five at a Time. Some Per&s;ons at that Time aboard the Ship admiring at the Manner of their Return, and &s;peaking of it with &s;ome Surprize, Sir <HI>Edward Sprage</HI> told them, That he brought tho&s;e Pid|geons with him from the <HI>Streights</HI>; and that when, pur&s;uant to his Order, he left the <HI>Revenge</HI> Man of War, to go aboard the <HI>London,</HI> all tho&s;e Pidgeons, of their own accord, and without the Trouble or
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Care of carrying, left the <HI>Revenge</HI> like|wi&s;e, and removed with the Sailors on board the <HI>London,</HI> where I &s;aw them: All which many of the Sailors afterwards confirm'd to me. What Sort of In&s;tinct this could proceed from, I leave to the Cu|rious.</P>
<P>SOON after this Sea Engagement I left the Fleet. And the Parliament, the Winter following, manife&s;ting their Re&s;entments again&s;t two of the Plenipotentiaries, <HI>viz. Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Arlington,</HI> who had been &s;ent over into <HI>Holland</HI>; and expre&s;&s;ing, withal, their great Umbrage taken at the prodigious Progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Arms in the <HI>United Provinces</HI>; and warmly remon|&s;trating the inevitable Danger attending <HI>England</HI> in their Ruin. King <HI>Charles</HI> from all this, and for want of the expected Supplies, found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of clapping up a &s;peedy Peace with <HI>Holland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THIS Peace leaving tho&s;e youthful Spirits, that had by the late Naval War been rais'd into a generous Ferment, under a perfect Inactivity at Home; they found them&s;elves, to avoid a Sort of Life that was their Aver&s;ion, oblig'd to look out for one more active, and more &s;uitable to their vigo|rous Tempers Abroad.</P>
<P>I MUST acknowledge my &s;elf one of that Number; and therefore in the Year 1674, I re&s;olv'd to go into <HI>Flanders,</HI> in or|der
<PB N="11" REF="18">
to &s;erve as Voluntier in the Army com|manded by his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> I took my Pa&s;&s;age accordingly at <HI>Dover</HI> for <HI>Calais,</HI> and &s;o went by way of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> for <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>ARRIVING at which Place, I was in|form'd that the Army of the Confederates lay encamp'd not far from <HI>Nivelle</HI>; and un|der the daily Expectation of an Engagement with the Enemy. This News made me pre&s;s forward to the Service; for which Purpo&s;e I carry'd along with me proper Letters of Recommendation to Sir <HI>Walter Vane,</HI> who was at that time a Major-Gene|ral. Upon further Enquiry I under&s;tood, that a Party of Hor&s;e, which was to guard &s;ome Waggons that were going to Count <HI>Montery</HI>'s Army, were to &s;et out next Morn|ing; &s;o I got an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t to introduce me to the Commanding Officer, which he readily oblig'd me in; and they, as I wi&s;h'd them, arriv'd in the Camp next Day.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;carce been there an Hour, when happen'd one of the mo&s;t extraordinary Ac|cidents in Life. I ob&s;erv'd in the Ea&s;t a &s;trange du&s;ty colour'd Cloud, of a pretty large Extent, riding, not before the Wind (for it was a perfect Calm) with &s;uch a pre|cipitate Motion, that it was got over our Heads almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;een. When the Skirts of that Cloud began to cover our Camp, there &s;uddenly aro&s;e &s;uch a terrible
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Hurricane, or Whirlwind, that all the Tents were carry'd aloft with great Vio|lence into the Air; and Soldiers Hats flew &s;o high and thick, that my Fan&s;y can re&s;emble it to nothing better than tho&s;e Flights of Rooks, which at Dusk of E|vening, leaving the Fields, &s;eek their roo&s;ting Places. Trees were torn up by the very Roots; and the Roofs of all the Barns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the Prince's Quarters, were blown quite away. This la&s;ted for about half an Hour, until the Cloud was wholly pa&s;t over us, when as &s;uddenly en|&s;ued the &s;ame pacifick Calm as before the Cloud's Approach. Its Cour&s;e was &s;eem|ingly directly We&s;t; and yet we were &s;oon after inform'd, that the fine Dome of the great Church at <HI>Utrecht</HI> had greatly &s;uffer'd by it the &s;ame Day. And, if I am not much mi&s;taken, Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> in his Memoirs, mentions &s;omewhat of it, which he felt at <HI>Lillo,</HI> on his Return from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, where he had been a Day or two before.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon after this, as I could get an Op|portunity, I deliver'd, at his Quarters, my recommendatory Letters to Sir <HI>Walter Vane</HI>; who receiv'd me very kindly, telling me at the &s;ame time, that there were &s;ix or &s;even <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who had enter'd them|&s;elves Voluntiers in the Prince's own Com|pany of Guards: And added, that he would
<PB N="13" REF="20">
immediately recommend me to Count <HI>Solmes,</HI> their Colonel. He was not wor&s;e than his Word, and I was enter'd accordingly.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army marcheth towards <HI>Binch.</HI></NOTE>IN about a Week's Time after, it was re&s;olv'd in a Council of War, to march to|wards <HI>Binch,</HI> a &s;mall wall'd Town, about four Leagues from <HI>Nivelle</HI>; the better to cut off the Provi&s;ions from coming to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Camp that Way.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI> we began our March; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voluntiers had the Favour of a Baggage Waggon appoint|ed them.

<P><PB N="14" REF="21">AS we were upon our March, I being among tho&s;e Detachments which made up the Rear Guard, ob&s;erv'd a great Party of the Enemy's Hor&s;e upon an A&s;cent, which, I then imagin'd, as it after prov'd, to be the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> taking a View of our Forces under March. There were many Defiles, which our Army mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s; through which that Prince politickly enough permitted the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted. But when Prince <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and our Detachments, thought to have done the like, the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> fell on our Rear Guard;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> in|tirely routs the Rear of the Con|federate Army.</NOTE> and, after a long and &s;harp Di&s;|pute, entirely routed 'em; the Marqui&s;s of <HI>A&s;&s;entar,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lieutenant-General, dying upon the Spot.</P>
<P>HAD the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> contented him|&s;elf with this Share of good Fortune, his Victory had been unconte&s;ted: But being pu&s;h'd forward by a vehement Heat of Temper (which he was noted for) and flu&s;h'd with this extraordinary Succe&s;s, he re&s;olv'd to force the whole Confederate Army to a Battle. In order to which, he immediately led his Forces between our Se|cond Line, and our Line of Baggage; by which means the latter were entirely cut off, and were &s;ubjected to the Will of the Enemy, who fell directly to plunder; in which they were not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
<PB N="15" REF="22">
routed <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves, who did not di&s;dain at that time to &s;hare with the Enemy in the plundering of their Friends and Allies.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voluntiers had their Share of this ill Fortune with the re&s;t; their Waggon appointed them being among tho&s;e intercepted by the Enemy; and I, for my Part, lo&s;t every Thing but Life, which yet was &s;aved almo&s;t as unaccountably as my Fellow-Soldiers had lo&s;t theirs. The Bag|gage, as I have &s;aid, being cut off, and at the Mercy of the Enemy, every one endea|vour'd to e&s;cape through, or over the Hedges. And as in all Ca&s;es of like Con|fu&s;ion, one endeavours to &s;ave him&s;elf upon the Ruins of others: So here, he that found him&s;elf &s;topt by another in getting over the Gap of a Hedge, pull'd him back to make way for him&s;elf, and perhaps met with the &s;ame Fortune from a Third, to the De&s;truc|tion of all. I was then in the Vigour of my Youth, and none of the lea&s;t active, and perceiving how it had far'd with &s;ome be|fore me, I clapt my left Leg upon the Shoulders of one who was thus contending with another, and with a Spring threw my &s;elf over both their Heads and the Hedge at the &s;ame time. By this Means I not only &s;av'd my Life (for they were all cut to Pieces that could not get over) but from an Eminence, which I &s;oon after attain'd, I

had an Opportunity of &s;eeing, and making my Ob&s;ervations upon the remaining Part of that glorious Conflict.</P>
<P>IT was from that advantagious Situation, that I pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd that the Imperia|li&s;ts, who led the Van, had now join'd the main Body. And, I confe&s;s, it was with an almo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure, that I be|held, about three a-Clock, with what in|trepid Fury they fell upon the Enemy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battle of <HI>Seneff.</HI></NOTE>In &s;hort, both Armies were univer&s;ally en|gag'd, and with great Ob&s;tinacy di&s;puted the Victory till Eleven at Night.

<P><PB N="17" REF="24">THERE were left that Day on the Field of Battle, by a general Computation, not le&s;s than eighteen Thou&s;and Men on both Sides, over and above tho&s;e, who died of their Wounds: The Lo&s;s being pretty equal, only the <HI>French</HI> carried off mo&s;t Pri&s;oners.

<P>THE Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> (as we were next Day inform'd) lay all that Night under a Hedge, wrapp'd in his Cloke: And either from the Mortification of being di&s;appointed in his Hopes of Victory; or from a Refle|ction of the Di&s;&s;ervice, which his own na|tural over Heat of Temper had drawn upon him, was almo&s;t incon&s;olable many Days after.

<P>BUT though common Vogue has given it the Name of a Battle, in my weak Opi|nion, it might rather de&s;erve that of a con|fus'd Skirmi&s;h; all Things having been for|cibly carried on without Regularity, or even De&s;ign enough to allow it any higher Denomination: For, as I have &s;aid before, notwith&s;tanding I was advantagiou&s;ly &s;ta|tioned

<P>THIS Siege was carried on with &s;uch Application and Succe&s;s, that the Be&s;iegers were in a few Days ready for a Storm; but the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> prevented them, by coming up to its Relief. Upon which the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> pur&s;uant to the Re&s;olution of a Council of War the Night before, drew off his Forces in order to give him Battle; and to that purpo&s;e, after the laborious Work of filling up our Lines of Contraval|lation, that the Hor&s;e might pa&s;s more freely, we lay upon our Arms all Night. Next Morning we expected the Imperial General, Count <HI>Souches,</HI> to join us; but in&s;tead of that, he &s;ent back &s;ome very frivolous Excu&s;es, of the Inconveniency of the Ground for a Battle; and after that, in&s;tead of joining the Prince, marched off quite another way; the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, marched directly for <HI>Ghent;</HI> exclaiming publickly again&s;t the Chicanery of <HI>Souches,</HI> and openly declaring, That he had been advertis'd of a Conference between a <HI>French</HI> Capuchin and that General, the Night before.

<P>BY the taking this Place, which made the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> the more earne&s;t up|on it, the <HI>French</HI> were wholly expell'd their la&s;t Year's a&s;toni&s;hing Conque&s;ts in <HI>Holland.</HI> And yet there was another Con|&s;ideration, that render'd the Surrender of it much more con&s;iderable.

<P>THE Enemy being march'd out, the Prince enter'd the Town, and immediately order'd publick Thank&s;givings for its happy Reduction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Limburgh</HI> be&s;ieged and taken by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE>THE Year 1675. yielded very little re|markable in our Army. <HI>Limburgh</HI> was be|&s;ieged by the <HI>French,</HI> under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> having Intelligence of, immedi|ately decamp'd from his fine Camp at <HI>Beth|lem,</HI> near <HI>Louvain,</HI> in order to rai&s;e the Siege.

Upon which Advice, the Prince, after a &s;hort Halt, made his little Army (for it con&s;i&s;ted not of more than thirty Thou&s;and Men) march back to <HI>Brabant.</HI> Nothing of moment, after this, occurr'd all that Campaign.</P>

It was &s;ome Time before the heavy Cannon, which we expected up the <HI>Maes,</HI> from <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="30">
arrived; which gave Occa&s;ion to a Piece of Raillery of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Calvo,</HI> the Governor, which was as hand&s;omely repartee'd. That Governor, by a Me&s;&s;enger, intima|ting his Sorrow to find, we had pawn'd our Cannon for Ammunition Bread. An|&s;wer was made, That in a few Days we hoped to give him a Ta&s;te of the Loaves, which he &s;hould find would be &s;ent him in|to the Town in extraordinary plenty.

<P>BUT our long expected Artillery being at la&s;t arriv'd, all this Je&s;t and Merriment was &s;oon converted into earne&s;t. Our Trenches were immediately open'd towards the <HI>Dauphin</HI> Ba&s;tion, again&s;t which were planted many Cannon, in order to make a Breach; my &s;elf as a Probationer being twice put upon the forlorn Hope to faci|litate that difficult Piece of Service. Nor was it long before &s;uch a Breach was ef|fected, as was e&s;teem'd practicable, and therefore very &s;oon after it was ordered to be attack'd.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">THE Di&s;po&s;ition for the Attack was thus ordered; two Serjeants with twenty Grenadiers, a Captain with fifty Men, my &s;elf one of the Number; then a Party car|rying Wool Sacks, and after them two Captains with one Hundred Men more; the Soldiers in the Trenches to be ready to &s;u&s;tain them, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould re|quire.</P>
<P>THE Signal being given, we left our Trenches accordingly, having about one Hundred Yards to run, before we could reach the Breach, which we mounted with &s;ome Difficulty and Lo&s;s; all our Batteries firing at the &s;ame in&s;tant to keep our Action in countenance, and favour our De&s;ign. When we were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ba&s;tion, the Enemy fir'd mo&s;t furiou&s;ly upon us with their &s;mall Cannon through a thin brick Wall, by which, and their hand Grena|does, we lo&s;t more Men than we did in the Attack it &s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT well had it been had our ill For|tune &s;topp'd there; for as if Di&s;a&s;ter mu&s;t needs be the Concomitant of Succe&s;s, we &s;oon lo&s;t what we had thus gotten, by a &s;mall, but very odd Accident. Not being furni&s;hed with &s;uch Scoopes as our Ene|mies made u&s;e of, in to&s;&s;ing their hand Grenadoes &s;ome di&s;tance off, one of our own Soldiers aiming to throw one over the Wall into the Counter&s;carp among the
<PB N="25" REF="32">
Enemy, it &s;o happen'd that he unfortunate|ly mi&s;s'd his Aim, and the Grenade fell down again on our &s;ide the Wall, very near the Per&s;on who fir'd it. He &s;tart|ing back to &s;ave him&s;elf, and &s;ome others who &s;aw it fall, doing the like, tho&s;e who knew nothing of the Matter fell into a &s;ud|den Confu&s;ion, and imagining &s;ome greater danger than there really was, every body was &s;truck with a panick Fear, and endea|vour'd to be the fir&s;t who &s;hould quit the Ba&s;tion, and &s;ecure him&s;elf by a real Shame from an imaginary Evil. Thus was a Ba|&s;tion, that had been gloriou&s;ly gain'd, in|advertently de&s;erted; and that too, with the Lo&s;s of almo&s;t as many Men in the Re|treat, as had been &s;lain in the On&s;et, and the Enemy mo&s;t triumphantly again took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>AMONG the Slain on our Side in this Action, was an En&s;ign of Sir <HI>John Fen|wick</HI>'s Regiment; and as an Approbation of my Services his Commi&s;&s;ion was be&s;tow|ed upon me.</P>
<P>A FEW Days after it was re&s;olv'd again to &s;torm that Ba&s;tion, as before; out of three <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and one <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment, then in the Camp, a Detachment was &s;e|lected for a fre&s;h Attack. Tho&s;e Regi|ments were under the Command of Sir <HI>John Fenwick</HI> (who was afterwards be|headed)
<PB N="26" REF="33">
Colonel <HI>Ralph Widdrington,</HI> and Colonel <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and Sir <HI>Alexander Collier,</HI> Father of the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Portmore,</HI> of the <HI>Scotch.</HI> Out of every of the&s;e four Regiments, as before, were detach'd a Captain, a Lieutenant, and an En&s;ign, with fifty Men: Captain <HI>An|thony Barnwell,</HI> of Sir <HI>John Fenwick</HI>'s Re|giment, who was now my Captain, com|manding that Attack.</P>
<P>AT break of Day the Attack was be|gun with great Re&s;olution; and though vigorou&s;ly maintain'd, was attended with the de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s. The Ba&s;tion was again taken, and in it the commanding Officer, who in Service to him&s;elf, more than to us, told us, that the Center of the Ba&s;tion would &s;oon be blown up, being to his Knowledge undermin'd for that purpo&s;e. But this Secret prov'd of no other u&s;e, than to make us, by way of Precaution, to keep as much as we could upon the Rampart. In this Attack Captain <HI>Barnwell</HI> lo&s;t his Life; and it happened my new Commi&s;&s;ion was wetted (not, as too frequently is the Cu|&s;tom, with a Debauch) but with a Bullet through my Hand, and the Breach of my Collar Bone with the Stroke of a Halberd.</P>
<P>AFTER about half an Hour's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ba&s;tion, the Mine under it, of which
<PB N="27" REF="34">
the <HI>French</HI> Officer gave us warning, was &s;prung; the Enemy at the &s;ame Time ma|king a furious Sally upon us. The Mine did a little, though the le&s;s, Execution, for being di&s;cover'd; but the Sally no way an&s;wer'd their End, for we beat them back, and immediately fix'd our Lodgment; which we maintain'd during the Time of the Siege. But to our double Surprize, a few Days after they fir'd another Mine un|der, or a&s;ide, the former, in which they had plac'd a quantity of Grenadoes, which did much more Execution than the other: Notwith&s;tanding all which, a Battery of Guns was pre&s;ently erected upon that Ba|&s;tion, which very con&s;iderably annoy'd the Enemy.</P>
<P>THE Breach for a general Storm was now render'd almo&s;t practicable; yet be|fore that could be advi&s;ably attempted, there was a &s;trong Horn-work to be taken. Upon this Exploit the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops only were to &s;ignalize them&s;elves; and they an&s;wer'd the Confidence repos'd in them; for though they were twice repuls'd, at the third On&s;et they were more &s;ucce&s;sful, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; which they likewi&s;e kept to the Rai|&s;ing of the Siege.</P>
<P>THERE was a Stratagem lay'd at this Time, which in its own Merit one would have thought &s;hould not have fail'd of a
<PB N="28" REF="35">
good Effect; but to &s;hew the Vanity of the highe&s;t human Wi&s;dom, it mi&s;carry'd. On the other &s;ide of the <HI>Maes,</HI> oppo&s;ite to <HI>Mae|&s;trich,</HI> lies the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Wyck,</HI> to which it is join'd by a &s;tone Bridge of &s;ix fair Arches. The De&s;ign was, by a fal&s;e Attack on that regular Fortification to draw the Strength of the Garri&s;on to its Defence, which was but very natural to imagine would be the Con&s;equence. Rea|dy to attend that well concerted fal&s;e At|tack, a large flat bottom'd Boat, properly furni&s;h'd with Barrels of Gun-Powder, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, was to fall down under one of the middle Arches, and when fix'd there, by firing the Powder to have blown up the Bridge, and by that means to have prevented the Return of the Garri&s;on to op|po&s;e a real Attack at that in&s;tant of Time to be made upon the Town of <HI>Mae&s;trich</HI> by the whole Army.</P>
<P>THE fal&s;e Attack on <HI>Wyck</HI> was accord|ingly made, which, as propos'd, drew the Main of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Mae&s;trich</HI> to its De|fence, and the Boat &s;o furni&s;h'd fell down the River as projected, but unfortunately, before it could reach the Arch, from the Darkne&s;s of the Night, running upon a Shoal, it could not be got off; for which Rea&s;on the Men in the Boat were glad to make a ha&s;ty E&s;cape for fear of being di&s;|cover'd;
<PB N="29" REF="36">
as the Boat was, next Morning, and the whole De&s;ign laid open.</P>
<P>THIS Stratagem thus mi&s;carrying, all Things were immediately got ready for a general Storm, at the main Breach in the Town; and the rather, becau&s;e the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had receiv'd inconte&s;table Intelli|gence, That Duke <HI>Schomberg,</HI> at the Head of the <HI>French</HI> Army, was in full march to relieve the Place. But before every Thing could be rightly got ready for the intended Storm (though &s;ome there were who pre|tended to &s;ay, that a Di&s;pute rais'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> about the Pro|priety of the Town, when taken, was the Cau&s;e of that Delay) we heard at &s;ome di|&s;tance &s;everal Guns fir'd as Signals of Re|lief; upon which we precipitately, and, as mo&s;t imagin'd, &s;hamefully drew off from before the Place, and join'd the grand Ar|my under Prince <HI>Waldeck.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army re|treats from before <HI>Mae&s;trich.</HI></NOTE> But it was Matter of yet greater Surprize to mo&s;t on the Spot, that when the Armies were &s;o joyn'd, we did not &s;tay to offer the Enemy Battle. The well known Courage of the Prince, then Generali&s;&s;imo, was &s;o far from &s;olving this Riddle, that it rather puzzled all who thought of it; however, the pre|vailing Opinion was, that it was occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome great Mi&s;under&s;tanding between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Dutch.</HI> And Ex|perience will evince, that this was not the

only Di&s;appointment of that Nature, occa|&s;ion'd by imperfect Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>BESIDES the Number of common Soldi|ers &s;lain in this Attack, which was not incon|&s;iderable, we lo&s;t here the brave <HI>Rhingrave,</HI> a Per&s;on much lamented on account of his many other excellent Qualifications, as well as that of a General.

<P>I REMEMBER the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> during the Siege, receiv'd a Shot through his Arm; which giving an immediate Alarm to the Troops under his Command, he took his Hat off his Head with the wounded Arm, and &s;miling, wav'd it, to &s;hew them there was no danger. Thus, after the mo&s;t gallant Defence again&s;t the mo&s;t couragi|ous On&s;ets, ended the Siege of <HI>Mae&s;trich</HI>; and with it all that was material that Cam|paign.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="39">UPON this Retreat the Prince marching back, lay for &s;ome Time among the Boors, who from the good Di&s;cipline, which he took care to make his Troops ob&s;erve, did not give us their cu&s;tomary boori&s;h Recep|tion. And yet as &s;ecure as we might think our &s;elves, I met with a little Pa&s;&s;age that confirm'd in me the Notions, which the ge|nerality, as well as I, had imbib'd of the private Barbarity of tho&s;e People, when|ever an Opportunity falls in their Way. I was &s;troling at a Di&s;tance from my Quar|ters, all alone, when I found my &s;elf near one of their Hou&s;es; into which, the Doors being open, I ventur'd to enter. I &s;aw no body when I came in, though the Hou&s;e was, for that Sort of People, well enough furni&s;h'd, and in pretty decent Order. I call'd, but no body an&s;wering, I had the Curio&s;ity to advance a little farther, when, at the Mouth of the Oven, which had not yet wholly lo&s;t its Heat, I &s;py'd the Corp&s;e of a Man &s;o bloated, &s;woln and parch'd, as left me little room to doubt, that the Oven had been the Scene of his De&s;tiny. I con|fe&s;s the Sight &s;truck me with Horror; and as much Courage and Security as I enter'd with, I withdrew in ha&s;te, and with quite different Sentiments, and could not fan&s;y my &s;elf out of Danger till I had reach'd our Camp. A wi&s;e Man &s;hould not frame an Accu&s;ation on Conjectures; but, on Inquiry,
<PB N="33" REF="40">
I was &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch bar|barous U&s;age is too common among tho&s;e People; e&s;pecially if they meet with a Straggler, of what Nation &s;oever.</P>
<P>THIS made me not very &s;orry when we decamp'd, and we &s;oon after receiv'd Or|ders to march and inve&s;t <HI>Charleroy;</HI> before which Place we &s;tay'd &s;omewhat above a Week, and then drew off.

<P>THE War thus ended by the Peace of <HI>Nimeugen,</HI> the Regiment in which I &s;erv'd, was appointed to lie in Garri&s;on at the <HI>Grave.</HI> We lay there near four Years, our Soldiers being mo&s;tly employ'd about the Fortifications. It was here, and by that Means, that I imbib'd the Rudiments of Fortification, and the practick Part of an Enginier, which in my more advanc'd Years was of no &s;mall Service to me.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, in the Year 1684, our Regiment receiv'd Orders to march to <HI>Haren,</HI> near <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>; where, with other Forces, we encamp'd, till we heard that <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> invaded by the <HI>French,</HI> in a Time of the profounde&s;t Peace, had &s;ur|render'd to them.

might not take it in their Heads to proceed yet further. In <HI>November</HI> we march'd into that Town, where Count <HI>Nivelle</HI> was Go|vernor: The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> at the &s;ame time, governing the <HI>Netherlands</HI> in the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING of any Moment happen'd after this, till the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.

<P>THO' I am no &s;tiff Adherer to the Doc|trine of Prede&s;tination, yet to the full A&s;&s;u|rance of a Providence I never could fail to adhere. Thence came it, that my natural De&s;ire to &s;erve my own native Country prevail'd upon me to quit the Service of an|other, though its Neighbour and Allie. Events are not always to direct the Judg|ment; and therefore whether I did be&s;t in following tho&s;e fondling Dictates of Nature, I &s;hall neither que&s;tion nor determine.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it was not long after my Ar|rival in <HI>England</HI> before I had a Commi&s;&s;ion

We had our Quar|ters at <HI>Leith,</HI> till the Time the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburg,</HI> then under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> had &s;urrender'd. After which, pur&s;uant to fre&s;h Orders, we march'd to <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> a Place of no great Strength, and as little Beauty; though yet
<PB N="40" REF="47">
I think I may &s;ay, without the lea&s;t Danger of an <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> that it is as plea&s;ant as mo&s;t Places in that Country. Here we lay two long Winters, perpetually harra&s;s'd upon Parties, and hunting of &s;omewhat wilder than their wilde&s;t Game, namely, the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> who were, if not as nimble footed, yet fully as hard to be found.</P>
<P>BUT General <HI>Mackay</HI> having receiv'd Orders to build a Fort at <HI>Inverlochy,</HI> our Regiment, among others, was commanded to that Service. The two Regiments ap|pointed on the &s;ame Duty, with &s;ome few Dragoons, were already on their March, which having join'd, we march'd together through <HI>Louquebar.</HI> This &s;ure is the wilde&s;t Country in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> if not in the World.

<P>IN this March, or rather, if you plea&s;e, mo&s;t di&s;mal Peregrination, we could but very rarely go two on a Brea&s;t; and oftner, like Geeze in a String, one after another. So that our very little Army had &s;ometimes,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
or rather mo&s;t commonly, an Extent of many Miles; our Enemy, the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> firing down upon us from their Summits all the Way. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible for our Men, or very rarely at lea&s;t, to return their Fa|vours with any Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s; for as they pop'd upon us always on a &s;udden, they never &s;tay'd long enough to allow any of our Soldiers a Mark; or even time enough to fire: And for our Men to march, or climb up tho&s;e Mountains, which to them were natural Champion, would have been as dangerous as it &s;eem'd to us impracticable. Neverthele&s;s, under all the&s;e di&s;heartning Di&s;advantages, we arriv'd at <HI>Inverlochy,</HI> and there perform'd the Task appointed, building a Fort on the &s;ame Spot where <HI>Cromwell</HI> had rais'd one before. And which was not a little remarkable, we had with us one <HI>Hill,</HI> a Colonel, who had been Go|vernor in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time, and who was now again appointed Governor by General <HI>Mac|kay.</HI> Thus the Work on which we were &s;ent being effected, we march'd back again by the Way of <HI>Gillycrancky,</HI> where that memorable Battle under <HI>Dundee</HI> had been fought the Year before.</P>
<P>SOME time after, Sir <HI>Thomas Leving&s;ton,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Tiviot,</HI> having receiv'd Intelligence that the <HI>Highlanders</HI> intended to fall down into the lower Countries, in a con&s;iderable Body, got together a Party
<PB N="42" REF="49">
of about five Hundred (the Dragoons, call'd the <HI>Scotch Greys,</HI> inclu&s;ive) with which he re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to give them a Meet|ing. We left <HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> the la&s;t Day o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>April,</HI> and encamp'd near a little Town call'd <HI>Forre&s;t,</HI> the Place where, as Tradi|tion &s;till confidently avers, the Witches met <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> and greeted him with their dia|bolical Au&s;pices. But this Story is &s;o natu|rally di&s;play'd in a Play of the immortal <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that I need not de&s;cend here to any farther Particulars.</P>
<P>HERE Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> receiv'd Intelligence, that the <HI>Highlanders</HI> de&s;ign'd to encamp upon the <HI>Spey,</HI> near the Laird of <HI>Grant's</HI> Ca&s;tle. Whereupon we began our March about Noon; and the next Day, about the Break thereof, we came to that River, where we &s;oon di&s;cover'd the <HI>Highlanders</HI> by their Fires. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> immediately, on Sight of it, i&s;&s;ued his Orders for our fording the River, and falling upon them as &s;oon after as po&s;&s;ible. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>High|landers</HI> totally routed.</NOTE>Both were according|ly perform'd, and with &s;o good Order, Se|crecy and Succe&s;s, that <HI>Cannon</HI> and <HI>Balfour,</HI> their Commanders, were obliged to make their E&s;cape naked.</P>
<P>THEY were about one Thou&s;and in Num|ber, of which were kill'd about three Hun|dred; we pur&s;ued them, till they got up <HI>Crowdale-Hill,</HI> where we lo&s;t them in a Fog. And, indeed, &s;o high is that Hill,

that they, who perfectly knew it, a&s;&s;ured me, that it never is without a little dark Fog hanging over it. And to me, at that In&s;tant of Time, they &s;eem'd rather to be People receiv'd up into Clouds, than flying from an Enemy.</P>
<P>NEAR this there was an old Ca&s;tle, call'd <HI>Lethendy,</HI> into which about Fifty of them made their Retreat, mo&s;t of them Gentle|men, re&s;olving there to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to them, with an Offer of Mercy, if they would &s;urrender: But they refus'd the profer'd Quarter, and fir'd upon our Men, killing two of our Grenadiers, and wound|ing another. During my Quarters at the <HI>Grave,</HI> having learnt to throw a Grenado, I took three or four in a Bag, and crept down by the Side of a Ditch, or Dyke, to an old thatch'd Hou&s;e near the Ca&s;tle, ima|gining, on my mounting the &s;ame, I might be near enough to throw them, &s;o as to do execution. I found all Things an&s;wer my Expectation; and the Ca&s;tle wanting a Cover, I threw in a Grenado, which put the Enemy immediately into Confu&s;ion. The Second had not &s;o good Succe&s;s, falling &s;hort; and the Third bur&s;t as &s;oon as it was well out of my Hand, though without Da|mage to my &s;elf. But throwing the Fourth in at a Window, it &s;o increas'd the Confu|&s;ion, which the fir&s;t had put them into, that
<PB N="44" REF="51">
they immediately call'd out to me, upon their Parole of Safety, to come to them.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I went up to the Door, which they had barricaded, and made up with great Stones; when they told me they were ready to &s;urrender upon Condition of obtaining Mercy. I return'd to Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>; and telling him what I had done, and the Con&s;equence of it, and the Me&s;&s;age they had de&s;ir'd me to deliver (a great many of the <HI>Highland</HI> Gentlemen, not of this Party, being with him) Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> in a high Voice, and broad <HI>Scotch,</HI> be&s;t to be heard and under&s;tood, order'd me back to tell 'em, <HI>He would cut them all to Pieces, for their Murder of two of his Grenadiers, after his Profer of Quarter.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS returning full of the&s;e melancholy Tidings, when Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> advancing after me a little Di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the Company; <HI>Hark ye, Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I be|lieve there may be among 'em &s;ome of our old Acquaintance</HI> (for we had &s;erv'd together in the Service of the <HI>States</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI>) <HI>therefore tell them they &s;hall have good Quarter.</HI> I very willingly carry'd back a Me&s;&s;age &s;o much chang'd to my Mind; and upon delivering of it, without the lea&s;t He|&s;itation, they threw down the Barricado, open'd the Door, and out came one <HI>Brody,</HI> who, as he then told me, had had a Piece of his No&s;e taken off by one of my Gre|nadoes.

I carry'd him to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who confirming my Me&s;&s;age, they all came out, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves Pri&s;oners.

<P>UPON this Succe&s;s Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> wrote to Court, giving a full Account of the whole Action. In which being pleas'd to make mention of my Behaviour, with &s;ome Parti|cularities, I had &s;oon after a Commi&s;&s;ion order'd me for a Company in the Regiment under the Command of Brigadier <HI>Tiffin.</HI></P>
<P>MY Commi&s;&s;ion being made out, &s;ign'd, and &s;ent to me, I repair'd immediately to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where the Regiment lay in Garri&s;on. A few Days after I had been there, Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> arriv'd with the Fleet, and anchor'd at St. <HI>Hellen</HI>'s, where he re|main'd about a Week. On the 18^t^h of <HI>May</HI> the whole Fleet &s;et Sail; and it being my Turn the &s;ame Day to mount the Main Guard, I was going the Rounds very early, when I heard great &s;hooting at Sea. I went directly to acquaint the Governor, and told him my Sentiments, that the two contending Fleets were actually engag'd, which indeed prov'd true; for that very Night a Pinnace, which came from our Fleet, brought News that Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had engag'd the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="53">
Admiral <HI>Turvile</HI>; and, after a long and &s;harp Di&s;pute, was making after them to their own Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE next Day, towards Evening, &s;eve|ral other Expre&s;&s;es arriv'd, one after an|other, all agreeing in the Defeat of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and in the Particulars of the burning their <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun,</HI> together with many other of their Men of War, at <HI>la Hogue.</HI> All which Expre&s;&s;es were imme|diately forwarded to Court by Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on,</HI> our Governor.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Months after this, our Re|giment, among many others, was, according to Order, &s;hipp'd off on a Secret Expedi|tion, under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> no Man knowing to what Place we were going, or on what De&s;ign; no, not the Commander him&s;elf. However, when we were out at Sea, the General, according to In&s;tructions, opening his Commi&s;&s;ion, we were &s;oon put out of our Su&s;pence, and in|form'd, that our Orders were to attack <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> But what was &s;o grand a Secret to tho&s;e concern'd in the Expedition, having been intru&s;ted to a Female Politician on Land, it was &s;oon di&s;cover'd to the Enemy; for which Rea&s;on our Orders were counter|manded, before we reach'd the Place of Action, and our Forces receiv'd Directions to land at <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle at <HI>Steenkirk.</HI></NOTE>SOON after this happen'd that memorable Battle at <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> which as very few at that Time could dive into the Rea&s;on of, and mi&s;taken Accounts of it have pa&s;s'd for authentick, I will mention &s;omewhat more particularly: The Undertaking was bold; and, as many thought, bolder than was con&s;i&s;tent with the Character of the wi&s;e Undertaker. Neverthele&s;s, the <HI>French</HI> having taken <HI>Namure</HI>; and, as the Male|contents alledg'd, in the very Sight of a &s;u|perior Army; and nothing having been done by Land of any moment, Things were blown into &s;uch a dangerous Fermen|tation, by a malicious and lying Spirit, that King <HI>William</HI> found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of attempting &s;omething that might appea&s;e the Murmurs of the People. He knew very well, though &s;poke in the Senate, that it was not true, that his Forces at the Siege of <HI>Namure</HI> exceeded tho&s;e of the Enemy; no Man could be more afflicted than he at the overflowing of the <HI>Mehaigne,</HI> from the continual Rains, which ob&s;tructed the Relief he had de&s;ign'd for that important Place; yet &s;ince his Maligners made an ill U&s;e of the&s;e fal&s;e Topicks, to in&s;inuate that he had no Mind to put an End to the War, he was re&s;olv'd to evince the contrary, by &s;hewing them that he was not afraid to ven|ture his Life for the better obtaining what was &s;o much de&s;ired.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">TO that Purpo&s;e, receiving Intelligence that the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> lay &s;trongly encamp'd at <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> near <HI>Enghien</HI> (tho' he was &s;en&s;ible he mu&s;t pa&s;s through many Defiles to engage him; and that the many Thickets between the two Armies would frequently afford him new Difficulties) he re&s;olv'd there to attack him. Our Troops at fir&s;t were forc'd to hew out their Pa&s;&s;age for the Hor&s;e; and there was no one Diffi|culty that his Imagination had drawn that was le&s;&s;en'd by Experience; and yet &s;o pro&s;perous were his Arms at the Beginning, that our Troops had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of &s;everal Pieces of the Enemy's Cannon. But the farther he advanc'd, the Ground growing &s;traiter, &s;o &s;trait as not to admit his Army's being drawn up in Bat|talia, the Troops behind could not give timely Succour to tho&s;e engag'd, and the Cannon we had taken was forcibly left be|hind in order to make a good Retreat. The <HI>French</HI> had lo&s;t all their Courage in the On&s;et; for though they had too fair an Op|portunity, they did not think fit to pur&s;ue it; or, at lea&s;t, did it very languidly. How|ever, the Malecontents at Home, I remem|ber, grew very well pleas'd after this; for &s;o long as they had but a Battle for their Money, like true <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> lo&s;t or won, they were contented.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">SEVERAL Cau&s;es, I remember, were a&s;&s;ign'd for this Mi&s;carriage, as they call'd it: Some there were who were willing to lay it upon the <HI>Dutch</HI>; and alledge a Say|ing of one of their Generals, who receiving Orders to relieve &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> that were over-power'd, was heard to &s;ay, <HI>Dam 'em, &s;ince they love Fighting let 'em have their Bellies full.</HI> But I &s;hould rather impute the Di&s;appointment to the great Lo&s;s of &s;o many of our brave&s;t Officers at the very fir&s;t On&s;et. General <HI>Mackay,</HI> Colonel <HI>Lanier,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> with both his Field-Officers, Sir <HI>Robert Douglas,</HI> Colonel <HI>Hodges,</HI> and many others falling, it was enough to put a very con&s;iderable Army into Confu&s;ion. I remember one par|ticular Action of Sir <HI>Robert Douglas,</HI> that I &s;hould think my &s;elf to blame &s;hould I omit: Seeing his Colours on the other Side the Hedge, in the Hands of the Enemy, he leap'd over, &s;lew the Officer that had them, and then threw them over the Hedge to his Company; redeeming his Colours at the Expen&s;e of his Life. Thus the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commander improv'd upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Ge|neral; for the brave <HI>Po&s;thumius</HI> ca&s;t his Stan|dard in the Middle of the Enemy for his Soldiers to retrieve, but <HI>Douglas</HI> retriev'd his from the Middle of the Enemy, without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and ca&s;t it back to his Soldiers

to retain, after he had &s;o bravely re&s;cued it out of the Hands of the Enemy.</P>
<P>FROM hence our Regiment receiv'd Or|ders to march to <HI>Dixmuyd,</HI> where we lay &s;ome time employ'd in fortifying that Place. While we were there, I had one Morning &s;tedfa&s;tly fix'd my Eyes upon &s;ome Ducks, that were &s;wimming in a large Water be|fore me; when all on a &s;udden, in the Mid&s;t of a perfect Calm, I ob&s;erv'd &s;uch a &s;trange and &s;trong Agitation in the Waters, that prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpriz'd me. I was at the &s;ame Moment &s;eiz'd with &s;uch a Giddine&s;s in my Head, that, for a Minute or two, I was &s;carce &s;en&s;ible, and had much a-do to keep on my Legs. I had never felt any thing of an Earthquake before, which, as I &s;oon after under&s;tood from others, this was; and it left, indeed, very apparent Marks of its Force in a great Rent in the Body of the great Church, which remains to this Day.</P>
<P>HAVING brought the intended Fortifica+tions into &s;ome tolerable Order, we receiv'd a Command out of hand to reimbarque for <HI>England.</HI> And, upon our Landing, Direc|tions met us to march for <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> where we had our Quarters all that Winter From thence we were order'd up to <HI>London</HI> to do Duty in the <HI>Tower.</HI> I had not been there long, before an Accident happen'd, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A dange|rous Acci|dent at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>THERE was at that Time, as I was a&s;&s;ur'd by my Lord <HI>Lucas,</HI> Con&s;table of it, upwards of twenty Thou&s;and Barrels of Gun|powder, in that they call the <HI>White-Tower,</HI> when all at once the middle Flooring did not only give way, or &s;hrink, but fell flat down upon other Barrels of Powder, together with many of the &s;ame combu&s;tible Matter which had been placed upon it.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING that fatal Battle the Year preceding, namely, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1694. the
<PB N="52" REF="59">
Confederate Army under King <HI>William</HI> lay encamp'd at <HI>Mont St. Andr&eacute;,</HI> an open Place, and much expos'd; while the <HI>French</HI> were entrench'd up to their very Teeth, at <HI>Vig|namont,</HI> a little Di&s;tance from us. This afforded Matter of great Reflection to the Politicians of tho&s;e Times, who could hard|ly allow, that if the Confederate Army &s;uffer'd &s;o much, as it really did in the Battle of <HI>Landen,</HI> it could con&s;i&s;t with right Conduct to tempt, or rather dare a new Engagement. But tho&s;e &s;age Objectors had forgot the well-known Courage of that brave Prince, and were as little capable of fathoming his De&s;igns. The Enemy, who to their Sorrow had by Experience been made better Judges, was re&s;olv'd to tra|ver&s;e both; for which Purpo&s;e they kept clo&s;e within their Entrenchments; &s;o that after all his Efforts, King <HI>William</HI> finding he could no way draw them to a Battle, &s;uddenly decamp'd, and march'd directly to <HI>Pont E&s;piers,</HI> by long Marches, with a De&s;ign to pa&s;s the <HI>French</HI> Lines at that Place.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding our Army march'd in a direct Line, to our great Surprize, we found the Enemy had fir&s;t taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. They gave this the Name of the <HI>Long March,</HI> and very de&s;ervedly; for though our Army march'd upon the String, and the Enemy upon the Bow, &s;en&s;ible of

the Importance of the Po&s;t, and the Nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;ecuring it, by double hor&s;eing with their Foot, and by leaving their Weary and Weak in their Garri&s;ons, and &s;upplying their Places with fre&s;h Men out of them, they gain'd their Point in di&s;appointing us. Though certain it is, that March co&s;t 'em as many Men and Hor&s;es as a Battle. How|ever their Ma&s;ter, the <HI>French</HI> King, was &s;o pleas'd with their indefatigable and au&s;pi|cious Diligence, that he wrote, with his own Hand, a Letter of Thanks to the Officers, for the great Zeal and Care they had taken to prevent the Confederate Army from entring into <HI>French Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>William,</HI> thus di&s;appointed in that noble De&s;ign, gave immediate Orders for his whole Army to march through <HI>Oude|nard,</HI> and then encamp'd at <HI>Ro&s;endale</HI>; after &s;ome little Stay at that Camp we were remov'd to the <HI>Camerlins,</HI> between <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> once more to take our Winter Quarters there among the Boors.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Vaude|mont</HI>'s glo|rious Re|treat.</NOTE>WHILE King <HI>William</HI> was thus engag'd in that glorious and important Siege, Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> being po&s;ted at <HI>Watergaem,</HI> with about fifty Battallions, and as many Squadrons, the Mare&s;chal <HI>Villeroy</HI> laid a De&s;ign to attack him with the whole <HI>French</HI> Army. The Prince imagin'd no le&s;s, there|fore he prepar'd accordingly, giving us Or|ders to fortify our Camp, as well as the little time we had for it would permit. Tho&s;e Orders were pur&s;u'd; neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it was beyond the Reach of my little Rea&s;on to account for our &s;o long Stay in the Sight of an Army &s;o much &s;upe|rior to ours. The Prince in the Whole could hardly mu&s;ter thirty Thou&s;and; and <HI>Villeroy</HI> was known to value him&s;elf upon having one Hundred Thou&s;and effective Men. However, the Prince provi&s;ionally &s;ent away all our Baggage that very Mor|ning to <HI>Ghent,</HI> and &s;till made &s;hew as if he re&s;olv'd to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t Extre|mity in our little Entrenchments. The Enemy on their Side began to &s;urround us; and in their Motions for that Purpo&s;e, blew up little Bags of Gun-powder, to give the readier Notice how far they had accom|pli&s;h'd it.

<PB N="55" REF="62">
Men (where I found Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montal</HI> endeavouring, if po&s;&s;ible, to get behind us) I could ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, they had &s;o far at|tain'd their Aim of encompa&s;&s;ing us, as to the very Fa&s;hion of a Hor&s;e's Shoe. This made me fix my Eyes &s;o intently upon the advancing Enemy, that I never minded what my Friends were doing behind me; though I afterwards found that they had been fileing off &s;o very artfully and private|ly, by that narrow Opening of the Hor&s;e-Shoe, that when the Enemy imagin'd us pa&s;t a Po&s;&s;ibility of E&s;cape, our little Army at once, and of a &s;udden, was ready to di&s;|appear. There was a large Wood on the Right of our Army, through which lay the Road to <HI>Ghent,</HI> not broader than to admit of more than Four to march a-brea&s;t. Down this the Prince had &s;lid his Forces, except to that very &s;mall Party which the Captain and my &s;elf commanded, and which was de|&s;ignedly left to bring up the Rear. Nor did we &s;tir till Captain <HI>Collier,</HI> then <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> to his Brother, now Earl of <HI>Port|more,</HI> came with the Word of Command for us to draw off.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Villeroy</HI> was told of our Retreat, he was much &s;urpriz'd, as thinking it a Thing utterly impo&s;&s;ible. However, at la&s;t, being &s;en&s;ible of the Truth of it, he gave Orders for our Rear to be attack'd; but we kept fireing from Ditch to Ditch, and
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Hedge to Hedge, till Night came upon us; and &s;o our little Army got clear of its gi|gantick Enemy with very incon&s;iderable Lo&s;s. However, the <HI>French</HI> fail'd not, in their cu&s;tomary Way, to expre&s;s the Sen&s;e of their Vexation, at this Di&s;appointment, with Fire and Sword in the Neighbourhood round. Thus Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> acquir'd more Glory by that Retreat than an intire Victory could have given him; and it was not, I confe&s;s, the lea&s;t Part of Satisfaction in Life, that my &s;elf had a Share of Honour under him to bring off the Rear at that his glorious Retreat at <HI>Ar&s;eel.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, in further Revenge of this po|litical Chicane of the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> and to oblige, if po&s;&s;ible, King <HI>William</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege from before <HI>Namur, Ville|roy</HI> enter'd into the Re&s;olution of Bom|barding <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Villeroy</HI> bombards <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI></NOTE> In order to which he encamp'd at <HI>Anderleck,</HI> and then made his Approaches as near as was convenient to the Town.

Nothing was to be &s;een like that Dexterity of our People in extingui&s;hing the Fires; for where the red-hot Bullets fell, and rais'd new Conflagrations, not Burghers only, but the vulgar Sort, &s;tood &s;tareing, and with their Hands impocketted, beheld their Hou&s;es gradually con&s;ume; and without offering prudent or charitable Hand to &s;top the growing Flames.</P>

the Cau&s;e of his incon&s;iderate Enemies. If I remember what I have read, the Sons of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> though Heathens, behav'd them&s;elves again&s;t an Enemy in a quite dif|ferent Manner. Their Hi&s;torians afford us more In&s;tances than a few of their generous Intimations to Kings and Generals, under actual Ho&s;tilities, of barbarous De&s;igns upon their Lives. I proceed to this of our own Countrymen.</P>
<P>SOON after the Di&s;covery had been made, by Per&s;ons actually engag'd in that inhuman De&s;ign, the Regiment, in which I &s;erv'd, with &s;ome others then in <HI>Flanders,</HI> receiv'd Orders, with all Expedition, to embarque for <HI>England</HI>; though, on our Arrival at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> fre&s;h Orders met us to remain on board the Tran&s;ports, till we had fur|ther Directions.</P>
<P>ON my going to <HI>London,</HI> a few Days after, I was told, that two Regiments only were now de&s;ign'd to come a-&s;hore; and that the re&s;t would be remanded to <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> the Danger apprehended being pretty well over. I was at <HI>White-Hall</HI> when I receiv'd this Notice; where meeting my Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> (who had ever &s;ince the &s;torming of the <HI>Terra Nova</HI> at <HI>Namur</HI> allow'd me a Share in his Favour) he expre&s;s'd him|&s;elf in the mo&s;t obliging Manner; and at parting de&s;ir'd he might not fail of &s;eeing me next Morning at his Hou&s;e; for he had
<PB N="62" REF="69">
&s;omewhat of an extraordinary Nature to communicate to me.</P>
<P>AT the time appointed, I waited on his Lord&s;hip, where I met Mr. <HI>Steel</HI> (now Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> and at that time his Secretary) who immediately introduc'd me. I found in company with him three Gentlemen; and after common Salutations, his Lord&s;hip de|liver'd into my Hands, an Order from the King in Council to go along with Captain <HI>Porter,</HI> Mr. <HI>de la Rue,</HI> and Mr. <HI>George Harris</HI> (who prov'd to be tho&s;e three with him) to &s;earch all the Tran&s;ports at <HI>Grave&s;|end,</HI> in order to prevent any of the Con&s;pi|rators getting out of <HI>England</HI> that Way. After an&s;wering, that I was ready to pay Obedience, and receiving, in private, the further nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions, we took our Leave, and Oars &s;oon after for <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI> 'Twas in our Pa&s;&s;age down, that I under|&s;tood that they had all been of the Con&s;pi|racy, but now reluctant, were become Wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> I produc'd my Authority to the Commanding Officer, who very readily paid Obedience, and gave A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But after our mo&s;t diligent Search, finding nothing of what we look'd for, we return'd that very Night to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>NEXT Day a Proclamation was to come out for the apprehending three of four Troopers, who were &s;ent over by King
<PB N="63" REF="70">
<HI>James,</HI> with a thou&s;and Pounds Reward for each: Mr. <HI>George Harris,</HI> who was the fourth, being the only Evidence again&s;t the other three. No &s;ooner were we re|turn'd from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> but <HI>Harris</HI> had In|telligence brought him, that <HI>Ca&s;&s;ells,</HI> one of the three, was at Mr. <HI>Allens</HI> in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Green.</HI> Upon which we went directly to the Place; and enqui|ring for Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> we were told he lodg'd there, and was in his Room.</P>
<P>I WAS oblig'd by my Order to go along with them, and a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em; and very well was it that I was &s;o: For in con&s;ideration of the Reward in the Proclamation, which, as I have &s;aid, was to come out the next Day, <HI>Harris</HI> and the re&s;t were for deferring his Seizure, till the coming out of that Procla|mation; but making an&s;wer, that in ca&s;e of his E&s;cape that Night, I mu&s;t be re&s;pon|&s;ible to my Superiors; who, under the mo&s;t favourable A&s;pect, would con&s;true it a Neg|lect of Duty, they were forc'd to comply; and &s;o he was taken up, and his Name that Night &s;truck out of the Proclamation. It is very true, by this faithful Di&s;charge of my Tru&s;t, I did &s;ave the Government one Thou&s;and Pounds; but it is equally &s;o, that I never had of my Governors one Farthing Con&s;ideration for what others term'd an over-officious Piece of Service; though in
<PB N="64" REF="71">
Ju&s;tice it mu&s;t be own'd a Piece of exact and di&s;intere&s;ted Duty.</P>
<P>SOME few Days after, attending by Di|rection at the Secretary's Office, with Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> there came in a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> &s;plut|tering and making a great Noi&s;e, that he was &s;ure he could di&s;cover one of the Con|&s;pirators; but the Mein and the Behaviour of the Man, would not give any Body Leave to give him any Credit or Regard. How|ever, the Man per&s;i&s;ting in his A&s;&s;ertions, I &s;poke to Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> to take him a&s;ide, and ask him what Sort of a Per&s;on he was: <HI>Harris</HI> did &s;o; and the <HI>Dutchman</HI> de&s;cri|bing him, &s;ays <HI>Harris,</HI> returning to me, I'll be hang'd if it be not <HI>Blackburn.</HI> Upon which we had him que&s;tion'd &s;omewhat more narrowly; when having no room to doubt, and under&s;tanding where he was, Colonel <HI>Rivet</HI> of the Guards was &s;ent for, and order'd to go along with us to &s;eize him. We went accordingly; and it proving to be <HI>Blackburn,</HI> the <HI>Dutchman</HI> had five Hundred Pounds, and the Colonel and o|thers the Remainder. <HI>Ca&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Black|burn,</HI> if &s;till alive, are in <HI>Newgate,</HI> confin'd by Act of Parliament, one only Witne&s;s, which was <HI>Harris,</HI> being producible again&s;t them.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Blackburn</HI> was &s;eiz'd, I found in the Chamber with him, one <HI>Davi&s;on,</HI> a
<PB N="65" REF="72">
Watch-maker, living in <HI>Holbourn.</HI> I car|ry'd him along with me to the Secretary of State; but nothing on his Examination ap|pearing again&s;t him, he was immediately di&s;charg'd. He offer'd afterwards to pre&s;ent me with a fine Watch of his own making, which I refus'd; and he long after own'd the Obligation.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon as the Depth of this Plot was fathom'd, and the intended Evil provided again&s;t, as well as prevented, King <HI>William</HI> went over into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and our Regi|ment thereupon receiv'd Orders for their immediate Return. Nothing of any Mo|ment occurr'd till our Arrival at our old Quarters, the <HI>Camerlins,</HI> where we lay di&s;|pers'd among&s;t the Country Boors or Far|mers, as heretofore. However, for our better Security in tho&s;e Quarters, and to pre&s;erve us from the Excur&s;ions of the neighbouring Garri&s;on of <HI>Furnes,</HI> we were oblig'd to keep an Out-guard at a little Place call'd <HI>Shoerbeck.</HI> This Guard was every forty-eight Hours chang'd, and re|mounted with a Captain, a Lieutenant, an En&s;ign, and three&s;core Men.</P>
<P>WHEN it came to my Turn to relieve that Guard, and for that Purpo&s;e I was ar|riv'd at my Po&s;t, it appear'd to me with the Face of a Place of Debauch, rather than Bu&s;ine&s;s; there being too vi&s;ible Tokens, that the hard Duty of both Officers
<PB N="66" REF="73">
and Soldiers had been that of hard Drin|king, the foule&s;t Error that a Soldier can commit, e&s;pecially when on his Guard.</P>
<P>TO confirm my Apprehen&s;ions, a little after I had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Guard, the Man of the Hou&s;e related to me &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;o many of 'em, that &s;atisfy'd me, that if ten &s;ober Men had made the At|tack, they might have fairly knock'd all my Predece&s;&s;ors of the la&s;t Guard on the Head, without much Difficulty. However, his Account admini&s;ter'd Matter of Caution to me, and put me upon taking a narrower View of our Situation. In con&s;equence whereof, at Night I plac'd a Centinel a Quarter of a Mile in the Rear, and &s;uch o|ther Centinels as I thought nece&s;&s;ary and convenient in other Places; with Orders, that upon Sight of an Enemy the Centinel near &s;hould fire; and that upon hearing that, all the other Centinels, as well as he, &s;hould ha&s;ten in to &s;trengthen our Main Guard.</P>
<P>WHAT my Jealou&s;y, on my Landlord's Relation, had &s;ugge&s;ted, happen'd ac|cordingly: For about one in the Morning I was alarm'd with the Cry of one of my Centinels, <HI>Turn out for God's &s;ake</HI>; which he repeated, with Vehemence, three or four times over. I took the Alarm, got up &s;uddenly; and with no little Difficulty got my Men into their Ranks, when the Per&s;on
<PB N="67" REF="74">
who made the Outcry came running in, al|mo&s;t &s;pent, and out of Breath. It was the Centinel, that I had luckily plac'd about a Quarter of a Mile off, who gave the Alarm, and his Musket fla&s;hing in the Pan, without going off, he endeavour'd to &s;upply with his Voice the Defect of his Piece. I had ju&s;t got my Men into their Ranks, in order to re|ceive the Enemy, when by the Moon-light, I di&s;cover'd a Party advancing upon us. My out Centinel challeng'd 'em, and as I had precaution'd, they an&s;wer'd, <HI>Hi&s;panioli</HI>; though I knew 'em to be <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, on my Survey of our Situa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion by Day-light, having mark'd in my Mind a proper Place for drawing up my Men in Ca&s;e of an Attack, which was too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">arrow to admit of more than two on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;t; and which would &s;ecure between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s and the Enemy a Ditch of Water: I re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lv'd to put in practice what had enter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">in'd me &s;o well in the Theory.

no. The Re&s;ult, neverthele&s;s, of that Con&s;ultation ended in this; that, &s;eeing us &s;o well upon our Guard, it was mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable to draw off. They &s;oon put their Re&s;olution into practice, which I was very glad to &s;ee; on Examination a little before having found that my Predece&s;&s;or, as in o|ther Things, had fail'd of Conduct in leaving me a Garri&s;on without Ammunition.</P>
<P>NEXT Morning I was very plea&s;ingly &s;urpriz'd with a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent of Wine, and &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary Refre&s;hments. At fir&s;t I made a little Scruple and He&s;itation whether or no to receive 'em; till the Bearer a&s;&s;ur'd me, that they were &s;ent me from the Officers of the next Garri&s;on, who had made me a Vi&s;it the Night before, as a candid Acknowledgment of my Conduct and good Behaviour. I return'd their Com|pliment, that I hop'd I &s;hould never receive Men of Honour otherwi&s;e than like a Man of Honour; which mightily pleas'd them.

from our more pacifick Po&s;ts to attend that Work. Our whole Army was under Move|ment to cover that Re&s;olution; and the Train fell to my Care and Command in the March. There accompany'd the Train a Fellow, &s;eemingly ordinary, yet very offi|cious and courteous, being ready to do any thing for any Per&s;on, from the Officer to the common Soldier. He travell'd along and mov'd with the Train, &s;ometimes on Foot, and &s;ometimes getting a Ride in &s;ome one or other of the Waggons; but ever full of his Chit-chat and Stories of Humour. By the&s;e in&s;inuating Ways he had &s;crew'd him&s;elf into the general good Opinion; but the Waggoners e&s;pecially grew particularly fond of him. At the End of our March all our Powder-Waggons were plac'd brea&s;t a-brea&s;t, and &s;o clo&s;e, that one mi&s;carrying would leave little doubt of the Fate of all the re&s;t. This in the Camp we commonly call <HI>the Park</HI>; and here it was that our new Gue&s;t, like another <HI>Phaeton,</HI> though under Pretence of Wearine&s;s, not Ambi|tion, got Leave of the very la&s;t Carter to the Train to take a Nap in his Waggon. One who had entertain'd a Jealou&s;y of him, and had watch'd him, gave Information a|gain&s;t him; <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Incen|diary taken and burnt in the Face of the Army.</NOTE>upon which he was &s;eiz'd and brought to me as Captain of the Guard. I caus'd him to be &s;earch'd; and upon &s;earch, finding Match, Touchwood, and other
<PB N="70" REF="77">
dangerous Materials upon him; I &s;ent him and them away to the Provoe. Upon the Whole, a Council of War was call'd, at which, upon a &s;trict Examination, he con|fe&s;s'd him&s;elf a hir'd Incendiary; and as &s;uch receiv'd his Sentence to be burnt in the Face of the Army. The Execution was a Day or two after: When on the very Spot, he further acknowledg'd, that on Sight or Noi&s;e of the Blow, it had been concerted, that the <HI>French</HI> Army &s;hould fall upon the Confederates under tho&s;e lamentable Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of <HI>Ri&s;wick.</HI></NOTE>THE Peace of <HI>Ri&s;wick</HI> &s;oon after taking place, put an End to all Incendiari&s;ms of either Sort. So that nothing of a Military Kind, which was now become my Pro|vince, happen'd of &s;ome Years after. Our Regiment was fir&s;t order'd into <HI>England</HI>; and pre&s;ently after into <HI>Ireland:</HI> But as the&s;e Memoirs are not de&s;ign'd for the Low Amuzement of a Tea-Table, but rather of the Cabinet, a Series of inglorious Inactivity can furni&s;h but very little towards 'em.</P>
<P>YET as little as I admir'd a Life of Inac|tivity, there are &s;ome Sorts of Activity, to which a wi&s;e Man might almo&s;t give Su|pinene&s;s the Preference: Such is that of bare|ly encountring Elements, and wageing War with Nature; and &s;uch, in my Opinion, would have been the &s;pending my Commi&s;|&s;ion, and very probably my Life with it,

in the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> For though the Climate (as &s;ome would urge) may afford a Chance for a very &s;peedy Advance in Honour, yet, upon revolving in my Mind, that tho&s;e Ro|tations of the Wheel of Fortune are often &s;o very quick, as well as uncertain, that I my &s;elf might as well be the Fir&s;t as the La&s;t; the Whole of the Debate ended in &s;omewhat like that Couplet of the excellent <HI>Hudibras:</HI>
<Q><L>Then he, that ran away and fled,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t lie in Honour's Truckle-bed.</L></Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, my better Planets &s;oon di&s;|annull'd tho&s;e melancholy Ideas, which a Rumour of our being &s;ent into the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> had crowded my Head and Heart with: For being call'd over into <HI>England,</HI> upon the very Affairs of the Regiment, I arriv'd there ju&s;t after the Orders for their Tran&s;portation went over; by which Means the Choice of going was put out of my Power, and the Danger of Refu&s;ing, which was the Ca&s;e of many, was very luckily avoided.</P>
<P>IT being judg'd, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible for me to return &s;oon enough to gain my Pa&s;&s;age, one in Power propos'd to me, that I &s;hould re&s;ign to an Officer then going over; and with &s;ome other contingent Ad|vantages, to my great Satisfaction, I was

put upon the Half-pay Li&s;t. This was more agreeable, for I knew, or at lea&s;t imagin'd my &s;elf wi&s;e enough to foretel, from the over hot Debate of the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the Partition Treaty, that it could not be long before the pre&s;ent Peace would, at lea&s;t, require patching.</P>
<P>UNDER this Sort of uncertain Settlement I remain'd with the Patience of a <HI>Jew,</HI> though not with Judaical Ab&s;urdity, a faithful Adherer to my Expectation. Nor did the Con&s;equence fail of an&s;wering, a War was apparent, and &s;oon after pro|claim'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">War Pro|claim'd.</NOTE> Thus waiting for an Opportunity, which I flatter'd my &s;elf would &s;oon pre&s;ent, the little Diver&s;ions of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the mo|derate Conver&s;ation of that People, were not of Temptation enough to make my Stay in <HI>England</HI> look like a Burden.</P>
<P>BUT though the War was proclaim'd, and Preparations accordingly made for it, the Expectations from all receiv'd a &s;udden Damp, by the as &s;udden Death of King <HI>William.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">K <HI>William</HI> dies.</NOTE> That Prince, who had &s;tared Death in the Face in many Sieges and Battles, met with his Fate in the Mid&s;t of his Diver&s;ions, who &s;eiz'd his Prize in an Hour, to human Thought, the lea&s;t adapted to it. He was a Hunting (his cu&s;tomary Diver&s;ion) when, by an unhappy Trip of his Hor&s;e, he fell to the Ground; and in the Fall di&s;plac'd his Collar-bone. The
<PB N="73" REF="80">
News of it immediately alarm'd the Court, and all around; and the &s;ad Effects of it &s;oon after gave all <HI>Europe</HI> the like Alarm. <HI>France</HI> only, who had not di&s;dain'd to &s;eek it &s;ooner by ungenerous Means, receiv'd new Hope, from what gave others Motives for De&s;pair. He flatter'd him&s;elf, that that long liv'd Ob&s;tacle to his Ambition thus re|mov'd, his Succe&s;&s;or would never fall into tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, which he had wi&s;ely con|certed for the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI>; but he, as well as others of his Adherents, was glo|riou&s;ly deceiv'd; that God-like Queen, with a Heart entirely <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> pro&s;ecuted her royal Predece&s;&s;or's Coun&s;els; and to remove all the very Faces of Jealou&s;y, im|mediately on her Acce&s;&s;ion di&s;patch'd to every Court of the great Confederacy, Per|&s;ons adequate to the Importance of the Me&s;|&s;age, to give A&s;&s;urances thereof.</P>
<P>THIS gave new Spirit to a Cau&s;e, that at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to langui&s;h in its Founder, as it &s;truck its great Oppo&s;ers with a no le&s;s mor|tifying Terror: And well did the great Suc|ce&s;&s;es of her Arms an&s;wer the Prayers and Efforts of that royal Soul of the Confedera|cies; together with the Wi&s;hes of all, that, like her, had the Good, as well as the Ho|nour of their Country at Heart, in which the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> were included. The fir&s;t Campaign gave a noble Earne&s;t of the Future. <HI>Bon, Key&s;erwaert, Venlo,</HI> and

<HI>Ruremond,</HI> were found Forerunners only of <HI>Donawert, Hoch&s;tet,</HI> and <HI>Blenheim.</HI> Such a March of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces to the Support of the tottering Empire, as it gloriou&s;ly manife&s;ted the ancient Genius of a warlike People; &s;o was it happily celebrated with a Succe&s;s an&s;werable to the Glory of the Un|dertaking, which concluded in Statues and princely Donatives to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject, from the then only Emperor in <HI>Europe.</HI> A &s;mall Tribute, it's true, for ran&s;om'd Nations and captiv'd Armies, which ju&s;tly enough inverted the Exclamations of a <HI>Ro|man</HI> Emperor to the <HI>French</HI> Monarch, who deprecated his Legions lo&s;t pretty near the &s;ame Spot; but to a much &s;uperior Num|ber, and on a much le&s;s glorious Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT my good Fortune not allowing me to participate in tho&s;e glorious Appendages of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Arms in <HI>Flanders,</HI> nor on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> I was re&s;olv'd to make a Pu&s;h for it the fir&s;t Opportunity, and wa&s;te my Minutes no longer on Court Attendances. And my Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> returning with his full Share of Laurels, for his never to be forgot|ten Services at <HI>Venlo, Ruremond,</HI> and <HI>Hoch&s;tet,</HI> found his active Genius now to be repos'd, under the le&s;s agreeable Burden of unhazardous Honour, where Quiet mu&s;t pro|vide a Tomb for one already pa&s;t any Dan|ger of Oblivion; deep Wounds and glo|rious Actions having anticipated all that
<PB N="75" REF="82">
could be &s;aid in Epitaphs or litteral In&s;crip|tions. Soon after his Arrival from <HI>Ger|many,</HI> he was appointed General of all her Maje&s;ty's Forces in <HI>Ireland</HI>; upon which going to congratulate him, he was pleas'd to enquire of me &s;everal Things re|lating to that Country; and particularly in what Part of <HI>Dublin</HI> I would recom|mend his Re&s;idence; offering at the &s;ame time, if I would go over with him, all the Services that &s;hould fall in his Way.</P>
<P>BUT Inactivity was a Thing I had too long lamented; therefore, after I had, as decently as I could, declin'd the latter Part, I told his Lord&s;hip, that as to a Place of Re&s;idence, I was Ma&s;ter of a Hou&s;e in <HI>Dublin,</HI> large enough, and &s;uitable to his great Quality, which &s;hould be at his Ser|vice, on any Terms he thought fit. Adding withal, that I had a Mind to &s;ee <HI>Spain,</HI> where my Lord <HI>Peterborow</HI> was now going; and that if his Lord&s;hip would fa|vour me with a Recommendation, it would &s;uit my pre&s;ent Inclinations much better than any further tedious Rece&s;s. His Lord|&s;hip was &s;o good to clo&s;e with both my Overtures; and &s;poke &s;o effectually in my Favour, that the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> then General of all the Forces order'd on that Expedition, bad me &s;peedily prepare my &s;elf; and &s;o when all Things were ready I embarqu'd with that noble Lord for
<PB N="76" REF="83">
<HI>Spain,</HI> to pur&s;ue his well concerted Under|taking; which, in the Event, will demon|&s;trate to the World, that little Armies, un|der the Conduct of au&s;picious Generals, may &s;ometimes produce prodigious Effects.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews,</HI> in whatever Part of the World, are a People indu&s;trious in the in|crea&s;ing of <HI>Mammon</HI>; and being accu&s;tom'd to the univer&s;al Methods of Gain, are al|ways e&s;teem'd be&s;t qualify'd for any Under|taking, where that bears a Probability of be|ing a Perqui&s;ite. Providing Bread, and other Requi&s;ites for an Army, was ever allow'd to carry along with it a Profit an&s;werable; and <HI>Spain</HI> was not the fir&s;t Country where that People had engag'd in &s;uch an Under|taking. Be&s;ides, on any likely Appearance of great Advantage, it is in the Nature as well as Practice of that Race, &s;trenuou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another; and that with the utmo&s;t Confidence and prodigious Alacrity. One of that Number, both competent and willing enough to carry on an Undertaking of that kind, fortunately came at that Juncture to &s;olicit the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> to be em|ploy'd as Proveditor to the Army and Troops, which were, or &s;hould be &s;ent into <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>IT will ea&s;ily be admitted, that the Earl, under his pre&s;ent Exigencies, did not de|cline to li&s;ten. And a very con&s;iderable Sum being offer'd, by way of Advance, the
<PB N="77" REF="84">
Method common in like Ca&s;es was pur&s;u'd, and the Sum propos'd accepted; by which Means the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> found him|&s;elf put into the happy Capacity of pro|ceeding upon his fir&s;t concerted Project. The Name of the <HI>Jew,</HI> who &s;ign'd the Contract, was <HI>Curti&s;os</HI>; and he and his Friends, with great Punctuality, advanc'd the expected Sum of One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, or very near it; which was immediately order'd into the Hands of the Pay-ma&s;ter of the Forces. For though the Earl took Money of the <HI>Jews,</HI> it was not for his own, but publick U&s;e. Ac|cording to Agreement, Bills were drawn for the Value from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> (then Lord Trea&s;urer) all which were, on that Occa&s;ion, punctually com|ply'd with.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> having thus fortunately found Means to &s;upply him&s;elf with Money, and by that with &s;ome Hor&s;e, after he had obtain'd Leave of the Lord <HI>Galoway</HI> to make an Exchange of two Regiments of Foot, receiv'd the Arch-Duke, and all tho&s;e who would follow him, aboard the Fleet; and, at his own Expen&s;e, tran&s;ported him and his whole Retinue to <HI>Barcelona</HI>: For all which prodigious Charge, as I have been very lately inform'd, from very good Hands, that noble Earl never to this Day receiv'd any Con&s;idera|tion
<PB N="78" REF="85">
from the Government, or any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>WE &s;ail'd from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in order to join the Squadron under Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ley Shovel:</HI> Meeting with which at the appointed Sta|tion off <HI>Tangier,</HI> the Men of War and Tran&s;ports thus united, made the be&s;t of their Way for <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> There we &s;tay'd no longer than to take aboard two Regi|ments out of that Garri&s;on, in lieu of two out of our Fleet. Here we found the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> who immediately took a Re&s;olu|tion to follow the Arch-Duke in this Expe|dition. He was a Per&s;on of great Gallan|try; and having been Vice-Roy of <HI>Cata|lonia,</HI> was receiv'd on board the Fleet with the utmo&s;t Satisfaction, as being a Per&s;on capable of doing great Service in a Country where he was well known, and as well be|lov'd.</P>
<P>SPEAKING <HI>Latin</HI> then pretty fluently, it gave me frequent Opportunities of conver|&s;ing with the two Father Confe&s;&s;ors of the Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>; and upon that Account I found my &s;elf honour'd with &s;ome Share in the Favour of the Arch-Duke him&s;elf. I mention this, not to gratify any vain Hu|mour, but as a corroborating Circum&s;tance, that my Opportunities of Information, in Matters of Con&s;equence, could not thereby be &s;uppos'd to be le&s;&s;en'd; but that I might more rea&s;onably be imagin'd to arrive at
<PB N="79" REF="86">
Intelligence, that not very often, or at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;oon, came to the Knowledge of o|thers.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Gibraltar</HI> we &s;ail'd to the Bay of <HI>Altea,</HI> not far di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Va|lencia,</HI> in the Road of which we continu'd for &s;ome Days. While we were there, as I was very credibly inform'd, the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> met with &s;ome fre&s;h Di&s;ap|pointment; but what it was, neither I nor any Body el&s;e, as far as I could perceive, could ever dive into: Neither did it appear by any outward Tokens, in that noble Ge|neral, that it lay &s;o much at his Heart, as tho&s;e about him &s;eem'd to a&s;&s;ure me it did.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, while we lay in <HI>Altea</HI> Bay, two Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els, and a &s;mall Squadron, were order'd again&s;t <HI>Denia,</HI> which had a &s;mall Ca&s;tle; but rather fine than &s;trong. And accordingly, upon our Offer to bring to bear with our Cannon, and preparing to fix our Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els, in order to bombard the Place, it &s;urrender'd; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Denia</HI> &s;ur|renders, and pro|claims the Arch-Duke K. of <HI>Spain</HI></NOTE> and acknowledg'd the Arch-Duke as lawful King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;o proclaim'd him. From this time, therefore, &s;peaking of that Prince, it &s;hall be under that Title. General <HI>Ramos</HI> was left Commander here; a Per&s;on who after|wards acted a very extraordinary Part in the War carry'd on in the Kingdom of <HI>Va|lencia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87">BUT notwith&s;tanding no po&s;itive Re&s;olu|tions had been taken for the Operations of the Campaign, before the Arch Duke's Departure from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow,</HI> ever &s;olicitous of the Honour of his Country, had premeditated another Enter|prize, which, had it been embrac'd, would, in all Probability, have brought that War to a much more &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion; and at the &s;ame time have obviated all tho&s;e Diffi|culties, which were but too apparent in the Siege of <HI>Barcelona.</HI> He had ju&s;tly and judiciou&s;ly weigh'd, that there were no Forces in the Middle Parts of <HI>Spain,</HI> all their Trrops being in the extream Parts of the Kingdom, either on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> or in the City of <HI>Barcelona</HI>; that with King <HI>Philip,</HI> and the royal Fa|mily at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there were only &s;ome few Hor&s;e, and tho&s;e in a bad Condition, and which only &s;erv'd for Guards; if therefore, as he rightly projected within him&s;elf, by the taking of <HI>Valencia,</HI> or any Sea-Port Town, that might have &s;ecur'd his Landing, he had march'd directly for <HI>Madrid</HI>; what could have oppos'd him? But I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to dilate more upon this Head a few Pages hence; and therefore &s;hall here only &s;ay, that though that Project of his might have brought about a &s;peedy and wonderful Revolution, what he was by his Orders afterwards oblig'd to, again&s;t his In|clinations,
<PB N="81" REF="88">
to pur&s;ue, contributed much more to his great Reputation, as it put him under a frequent Nece&s;&s;ity of overcoming Difficulties, which, to any other General, would have appear'd un&s;urmountable.</P>

<P>THIS &s;hort De&s;cription of the&s;e two Places will appear highly nece&s;&s;ary, if it be con&s;ider'd, that no Per&s;on without it would be able to judge of the De&s;ign which the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> intended to pur&s;ue, when he fir&s;t took the Arch-Duke aboard the Fleet.

Whereas if the General, as he intended, had made an immediate March to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after he had &s;ecur'd <HI>Valencia,</HI> and the Towns adja|cent, which were all ready to &s;ubmit and declare for King <HI>Charles</HI>; or if otherwi&s;e inclin'd, had it not in their Power to make any con&s;iderable Re&s;i&s;tance; to which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f it be added, that he could have had Mules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Hor&s;es immediately provided for him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n what Number he pleas'd, together with Carriages nece&s;&s;ary for Artillery, Baggage, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ammunition; in few Days he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ave forc'd King <HI>Philip</HI> out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> where he had &s;o little Force to oppo&s;e him.

and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where only, as I &s;aid before, were any regular Troops.</P>
<P>AND on the other Side, as the Forces of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> were more than &s;ufficient for an Attempt where there was &s;o little Danger of Oppo&s;ition; &s;o if their Army on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hould have march'd back upon him into the Coun|try; either the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Army could have enter'd into <HI>Spain</HI> without Oppo&s;ition; or, at wor&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing the General had been forc'd to retire, his Retreat would have been ea&s;y and &s;afe into tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Valencia</HI> and <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which he pre|viou&s;ly had &s;ecur'd. Be&s;ides, <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Place in <HI>Spain,</HI> if not in the whole World, was already in our Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and a great Fleet at Hand ready to give A&s;&s;i&s;tance in all Places near the Sea.

<P>BUT none of the&s;e Arguments, though every one of them is founded on &s;olid Rea|&s;on, were of Force enough again&s;t the pre|vailing Opinion for an Attempt upon <HI>Cata|lonia.</HI> Mr. <HI>Crow,</HI> Agent for the Queen in

tho&s;e Parts, had &s;ent into <HI>England</HI> mo&s;t po|&s;itive A&s;&s;urances, that nothing would be wanting, if once our Fleet made an Inva&s;ion among&s;t the <HI>Catalans:</HI> The Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> likewi&s;e abounded in mighty Offers and pro|digious A&s;&s;urances; all which enforc'd our Army to that Part of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that gal|lant Prince to tho&s;e Attempts in which he lo&s;t his Life. Very much again&s;t the Incli|nation of our General, who fore&s;aw all tho&s;e Difficulties, which were no le&s;s evident after|wards to every one; and the Sen&s;e of which occa&s;ion'd tho&s;e Delays, and that Oppo&s;i|tion to any Effort upon <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which ran thro' &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Councils of War.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, pur&s;uant to his In&s;tructions from <HI>England,</HI> the repeated De&s;ires of the Arch-Duke, and the Importunities of the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> our General gave Orders to &s;ail from <HI>Altea</HI> towards the Bay of <HI>Barce|lona,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of <HI>Pe|terborow</HI> arrives in <HI>Barcelona</HI> Bay, and after &s;ome time lands the Forces.</NOTE>Never|thele&s;s, when we arriv'd there, he was very unwilling to land any of the Forces, till he &s;aw &s;ome Probability of that A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Succour &s;o much boa&s;ted of, and &s;o often promis'd. But as nothing appear'd but &s;ome &s;mall Numbers of Men, very indifferently arm'd, and without either Gentlemen or Officers at the Head of them; the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> was of Opinion, this could not be deem'd &s;ufficient Encouragement for him to engage in an Enterprize, which carry'd
<PB N="86" REF="93">
&s;o poor a Face of Probability of Succe&s;s a|long with it. In an&s;wer to this it was urg'd, that till a De&s;cent was made, and the Affairs thoroughly engag'd in, it was not to be ex|pected that any great Numbers would ap|pear, or that Per&s;ons of Condition would di&s;cover them&s;elves. Upon all which it was re&s;olv'd the Troops &s;hould be landed.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, our Forces were di&s;em|bark'd, and immediately encamp'd; not|with&s;tanding which the Number of Suc|cours increas'd very &s;lowly, and that after the fir&s;t &s;traggling Manner. Nor were tho&s;e that did appear any way to be depended on; coming when they thought fit, and go|ing away when they pleas'd, and not to be brought under any regular Di&s;cipline. It was then pretended, that until they &s;aw the Artillery landed as well as Forces, they would not believe any Siege actually in|tended. This brought the General under a &s;ort of Nece&s;&s;ity of complying in that al&s;o. Though certainly &s;o to do mu&s;t be allow'd a little unrea&s;onable, while the Majority in all Councils of War declar'd the De&s;ign to be impracticable; and the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> had po&s;itive Orders to proceed ac|cording to &s;uch Majorities.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> was pleas'd to demand Pay for tho&s;e Stragglers, as Officers and Soldiers, endeavouring to maintain, that it could not be expected that Men
<PB N="87" REF="94">
&s;hould venture their Lives for nothing. Thus we came to <HI>Catalonia</HI> upon A&s;&s;urances of univer&s;al A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but found, when we came there, that we were to have none un|le&s;s we paid for it. And as we were &s;ent thither without Money to pay for any thing, it had certainly been for us more tolerable to have been in a Country where we might have taken by Force what we could not ob|tain any other Way.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to do the <HI>Miquelets</HI> all po&s;|&s;ible Ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding the Number of 'em, which hover'd about the Place, never much exceeded fifteen Hundred Men; if &s;ometimes more, oftner le&s;s; and though they never came under any Command, but planted them&s;elves where and as they pleas'd; yet did they con&s;iderable Service in taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Country Hou&s;es and Convents, that lay between the Hills and the Plain of <HI>Barcelona</HI>; by means whereof they render'd it impo&s;&s;ible for the Enemy to make any <HI>Sorties</HI> or Sallies at any Di&s;tance from the Town.</P>
<P>AND now began all tho&s;e Difficulties to bear, which long before by the General had been apprehended. The Troops had con|tinu'd under a State of Inactivity for the Space of three Weeks, all which was &s;pent in perpetual Contrivances and Di&s;putes a|mong&s;t our &s;elves, not with the Enemy. In &s;ix &s;everal Councils of War the Siege of
<PB N="88" REF="95">
<HI>Barcelona,</HI> under the Circum&s;tances we then lay, was rejected as a Madne&s;s and Impo&s;&s;ibility. And though the General and Brigadier <HI>Stanhope</HI> (afterward Earl <HI>Stan|hope</HI>) con&s;ented to &s;ome Effort, yet it was rather that &s;ome Effort &s;hould be made to &s;a|tisfy the Expectation of the World, than with any Hopes of Succe&s;s. However, no Con&s;ent at all could be obtain'd from any Council of War; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> General in particular declar'd, that he would not obey even the Commands of the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow,</HI> if he &s;hould order the Sacrifice of the Troops under him in &s;o unju&s;tifiable a Manner, without the Con&s;ent of a Council of War.</P>
<P>AND yet all tho&s;e Officers, who refus'd their Con&s;ent to the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> offer'd to march into the Country, and at|tempt any other Place, that was not pro|vided with &s;o &s;trong and numerous a Gar|ri&s;on; taking it for granted, that no Town in <HI>Catalonia, Barcelona</HI> excepted, could make long Re&s;i&s;tance; and in ca&s;e the Troops in that Garri&s;on &s;hould pur&s;ue them, they then might have an Opportunity of fighting them at le&s;s Di&s;advantage in the open Field, than behind the Walls of a Place of &s;uch Strength. And, indeed, &s;hould they have i&s;&s;u'd out on any &s;uch De&s;ign, a Defeat of tho&s;e Troops would have put the Province of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> toge|ther with the Kingdoms of <HI>Aragon</HI> and <HI>Va|lencia,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="96">
into the Hands of King <HI>Charles</HI> more effectually than the taking of <HI>Barcelona</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>LET it be ob&s;erv'd, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> that by tho&s;e Offers of the Land Officers in a Coun|cil of War, it is ea&s;y to imagine what would have been the Succe&s;s of our Troops, had they march'd directly from <HI>Valencia</HI> to <HI>Madrid.</HI> For if after two Months Alarm, it was thought rea&s;onable, as well as prac|ticable, to march into the open Country rather than attempt the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> where Forces equal, if not &s;uperior in Num|ber, were ready to follow us at the Heels; what might not have been expected from an Inva&s;ion by our Troops when and where they could meet with little Oppo&s;ition? But leaving the Con&s;ideration of what might have been, I &s;hall now endeavour at lea&s;t with great Exactne&s;s to &s;et down &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable Events from our taking to the Relief of <HI>Barcelona.</HI></P>
<P>THE repeated Refu&s;als of the Councils of War for undertaking the Siege of &s;o &s;trong a Place, with a Garri&s;on &s;o nume|rous, and tho&s;e Refu&s;als grounded upon &s;uch &s;olid Rea&s;ons, again&s;t a De&s;ign &s;o ra&s;h, reduc'd the General to the utmo&s;t Per|plexity. The Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> was immerg'd in complaint; all belonging to him lamenting the hard Fate of that Prince, to be brought into <HI>Catalonia</HI> only to return
<PB N="90" REF="97">
again, without the Offer of any one Effort in his Favour. On the other Hand, our own Officers and Soldiers were highly di&s;&s;a|tisfy'd, that they were reproach'd, becau&s;e not di&s;pos'd to enter upon and engage them|&s;elves in Impo&s;&s;ibilities. And, indeed, in the Manner that the Siege was propos'd and in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> in e|very of the &s;everal Councils of War, after the Lo&s;s of many Men, thrown away to no other purpo&s;e, but to avoid the Shame (as the Expre&s;&s;ion ran) of coming like Fools and going away like Cowards, it could have ended in nothing but a Retreat at la&s;t.</P>
<P>IT afforded but &s;mall Comfort to the Earl to have fore&s;een all the&s;e Difficulties, and to have it in his Power to &s;ay, that he would never have taken the Arch-Duke on Board, nor have propos'd to him the Hopes of a Recovery of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy from King <HI>Philip,</HI> if he could have imagin'd it probable, that he &s;hould not have been at liberty to pur&s;ue his own De&s;ign, according to his own Judgment. It mu&s;t be allow'd very hard for him, who had undertaken &s;o great a Work, and that without any Orders from the Government; and by &s;o doing could have had no Ju&s;tification but by Suc|ce&s;s; I &s;ay, it mu&s;t be allow'd to be very hard (after the Undertaking had been ap|prov'd in <HI>England</HI>) that he &s;hould find
<PB N="91" REF="98">
him&s;elf to be directed in this Manner by tho&s;e at a Di&s;tance, upon ill grounded and confident Reports from Mr. <HI>Crow</HI>; and compell'd, as it were, though General, to follow the Sentiments of Strangers, who either had private Views of Ambition, or had no immediate Care or Concern for the Troops employ'd in this Expedition.</P>
<P>SUCH were the pre&s;ent unhappy Circum|&s;tanches of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> in the Camp before <HI>Barcelona:</HI> Impo&s;&s;ibilities pro|pos'd; no Expedients to be accepted; a Court reproaching; Councils of War re|jecting; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> General refu&s;ing the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Troops under his Com|mand; and what &s;urmounted all, a De&s;pair of bringing &s;uch Animo&s;ities and differing Opinions to any tolerable Agreement. Yet all the&s;e Difficulties, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging the Earl, &s;et every Faculty of his more afloat; and, at la&s;t, produc'd a lucky Thought, which was happily attended with Events extraor|dinary, and Scenes of Succe&s;s much beyond his Expectation; &s;uch as the General him|&s;elf was heard to confe&s;s, it had been next to Folly to have look'd for; as certainly, <HI>in prima facie,</HI> it would hardly have born propo&s;ing, to take by Surprize a Place much &s;tronger than <HI>Barcelona</HI> it &s;elf. True it is, that his only Hope of &s;ucceeding con&s;i&s;ted in this: That no Per&s;on could &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an Enterprize could enter into the Imagina|tion

of Man; and without doubt the Gene|ral's chief Dependence lay upon what he found true in the Sequel; that the Gover|nor and Garri&s;on of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> by rea&s;on of their own Security, would be very negli|gent, and very little upon their Guard.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to make the Experiment, he took an Opportunity, unknown to any Per&s;on but an <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> that attended him, and went out to view the Fortifica|tions: And there being no Hor&s;e in that &s;trong Fortre&s;s; and the <HI>Miquelets</HI> being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the Hou&s;es and Gardens in the Plain, it was not difficult to give him|&s;elf that Satisfaction, taking his Way by the Foot of the Hill. The Ob&s;ervation he made of the Place it &s;elf, the Negligence and Supinene&s;s of the Garri&s;on, together with his own unea&s;y Circum&s;tances, &s;oon brought the Earl to a Re&s;olution of putting his fir&s;t Conceptions in Execution, &s;atis|fy'd as he was, from the Situation of the Ground between <HI>Monjouick</HI> and the Town, that if the fir&s;t was in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Siege of the latter might be undertaken with &s;ome Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, &s;ome may be apt to conclude that the Siege afterward &s;ucceeding, when the Attack was made from the Side of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> it had not been impo&s;&s;ible to have prevail'd, if the Effort had been made on the Ea&s;t Side of the
<PB N="93" REF="100">
Town, where our Forces were at fir&s;t en|camp'd, and where only we could have made our Approaches, if <HI>Monjouick</HI> had not been in our Power. But a few Words will convince any of common Experience of the utter Impo&s;&s;ibility of Succe&s;s upon the Ea&s;t Part of the Town, although many al|mo&s;t miraculous Accidents made us &s;ucceed when we brought our Batteries to bear upon that Part of <HI>Barcelona</HI> towards the We&s;t. The Ground to the Ea&s;t was a perfect Level for many Miles, which would have nece&s;|&s;itated our making our Approaches in a re|gular Way; and con&s;equently our Men mu&s;t have been expos'd to the full Fire of their whole Artillery. Be&s;ides, the Town is on that Side much &s;tronger than any o|ther; there is an Out-work ju&s;t under the Walls of the Town, flank'd by the Cour|tin and the Faces of two Ba&s;tions, which might have co&s;t us half our Troops to po&s;&s;e&s;s, before we could have rais'd a Bat|tery again&s;t the Walls. Or &s;uppo&s;ing, after all, a competent Breach had been made, what a wi&s;e Piece of Work mu&s;t it have been to have attempted a Storm a|gain&s;t double the Number of regular Troops within?</P>
<P>ON the contrary, we were &s;o favour'd by the Situation, when we made the Attack from the Side of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> that the Breach was made and the Town taken without
<PB N="94" REF="101">
opening of Trenches, or without our being at all incommoded by any Sallies of the Enemy; as in truth they made not one du|ring the whole Siege. Our great Battery, which con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of fifty heavy Cannon, &s;upply'd from the Ships, and ma|nag'd by the Seamen, were plac'd upon a Spot of ri&s;ing Ground, ju&s;t large enough to contain our Guns, with two deep hollow Ways on each Side the Field, at each End whereof we had rais'd a little Redoubt, which &s;erv'd to pre&s;erve our Men from the Shot of the Town. Tho&s;e little Redoubts, in which we had &s;ome Field Pieces, flank'd the Battery, and render'd it intirely &s;ecure from any Surprize of the Enemy. There were &s;everal other &s;maller Batteries rais'd upon the Hills adjacent, in Places not to be approach'd, which, in a manner, render'd all the Artillery of the Enemy u&s;ele&s;s, by rea&s;on their Men could not ply 'em, but with the utmo&s;t Danger; whereas ours were &s;ecure, very few being kill'd, and tho&s;e mo&s;tly by random Shot.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the General; forc'd, as he was, to take this extraordinary Re&s;olu|tion, he concluded, the readie&s;t Way to &s;ur|prize his Enemies was to elude his Friends. He therefore call'd a Council of War a&s;hore, of the Land Officers; and aboard, of the Admirals and Sea Officers: In both which it was re&s;olv'd, that in ca&s;e the Siege of
<PB N="95" REF="102">
<HI>Barcelona</HI> was judg'd impracticable, and that the Troops &s;hould be re-imbark'd by a Day appointed, an Effort &s;hould be made upon the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> According|ly, the Day affix'd being come, the heavy Artillery landed for the Siege was return'd aboard the Ships, and every thing in ap|pearance prepar'd for a Re-imbarkment. During which, the General was oblig'd to undergo all the Reproaches of a di&s;&s;atisfy'd Court; and what was more unea&s;y to him, the Murmurings of the Sea Officers, who, not &s;o competent Judges in what related to Sieges, were one and all inclin'd to a De|&s;ign upon <HI>Barcelona</HI>; and the rather, be|cau&s;e as the Sea&s;on was &s;o far &s;pent, it was thought altogether improper to engage the Fleet in any new Undertaking. However, all Things were &s;o well di&s;guis'd by our &s;eeming Preparations for a Retreat, that the very Night our Troops were in March towards the Attack of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> there were publick Entertainments and Rejoicings in the Town for the rai&s;ing of the Siege.</P>
<P>THE Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> had taken large Li|berties in complaining again&s;t all the Pro|ceedings in the Camp before <HI>Barcelona</HI>; even to In&s;inuations, that though the Earl gave his Opinion for &s;ome Effort in publick, yet us'd he not &s;ufficient Authority over the other General Officers to incline them to com|ply; throwing out withal &s;ome Hints, that the
<PB N="96" REF="103">
General from the Beginning had declar'd him&s;elf in favour of other Operations, and again&s;t coming to <HI>Catalonia</HI>; the latter Part whereof was nothing but Fact. On the other Side, the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> complain'd, that the boa&s;ted A&s;&s;i&s;tance was no way made good; and that in failure thereof, his Troops were to be &s;acrificed to the Humours of a Stranger; one who had no Command; and who&s;e Conduct might bear a Que&s;tion whether equal to his Cou|rage. The&s;e Reproaches of one another had bred &s;o much ill Blood between tho&s;e two great Men, that for above a Fortnight they had no Corre&s;pondence, nor ever ex|chang'd one Word.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl marches to <HI>Monjouick</HI></NOTE>THE Earl, however, having made his proper Di&s;po&s;itions, and deliver'd out his Orders, began his March in the Evening with twelve Hundred Foot and two Hun|dred Hor&s;e, which of nece&s;&s;ity were to pa&s;s by the Quarters of the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI> That Prince, on their Appearance, was told that the General was come to &s;peak with him; and being brought into his Apart|ment, the Earl acquainted him, that he had at la&s;t re&s;olv'd upon an Attempt again&s;t the Enemy; adding, that now, if he pleas'd, he might be a Judge of their Behaviour, and &s;ee whether his Officers and Soldiers had de&s;erv'd that Character which he had &s;o liberally given 'em. The Prince made
<PB N="97" REF="104">
an&s;wer, that he had always been ready to take his Share; but could hardly believe, that Troops marching that way could make any Attempt again&s;t the Enemy to &s;atisfac|tion. However, without further Di&s;cour&s;e he call'd for his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>BY this we may &s;ee what Share Fortune has in the greate&s;t Events. In all probabi|lity the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> had never en|gag'd in &s;uch a dangerous Affair in cold Blood and unprovok'd; and if &s;uch an En|terprize had been re&s;olv'd on in a regular Way, it is very likely he might have given the Command to &s;ome of the General Officers; &s;ince it is not u&s;ual, nor hardly allowable, for one, that commands in chief, to go in Per&s;on on &s;uch kind of Services. But here we &s;ee the General and Prince, notwith&s;tanding their late indifferent Har|mony, engag'd together in this mo&s;t de|&s;perate Undertaking.</P>
<P>BRIGADIER <HI>Stanhope</HI> and Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> (now Sir <HI>Paul</HI>) were the General's parti|cular Friends, and tho&s;e he mo&s;t con&s;ulted, and mo&s;t confided in; yet he never imparted this Re&s;olution of his to either of them; for he was not willing to engage them in a De&s;ign &s;o dangerous, and where there was &s;o little Hope of Succe&s;s; rather choo&s;ing to re&s;erve them as Per&s;ons mo&s;t capable of giving Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Confu|&s;ion, great enough already, which yet mu&s;t
<PB N="98" REF="105">
have been greater, if any Accident had hap|pen'd to him&s;elf. And I have very good Rea&s;on to believe, that the Motive, which mainly engag'd the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> in this Enterprize, was to &s;atisfy the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> and the World, that his Diffidence proceeded from his Concern for the Troops committed to his Charge, and not for his own Per&s;on. On the other Hand, the great Characters of the two Gentlemen ju&s;t men|tion'd are &s;o well known, that it will ea&s;ily gain Credit, that the only Way the Gene|ral could take to prevent their being of the Party, was to conceal it from them, as he did from all Mankind, even from the Arch-Duke him&s;elf. And certainly there never was a more univer&s;al Surprize than when the firing was heard next Morning from <HI>Monjouick.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I now proceed to give an exact Ac|count of this great Action; of which no Per|&s;on, that I have heard of, ever yet took upon him to deliver to Po&s;terity the glorious Par|ticulars; and yet the Con&s;equences and Events, by what follows, will appear &s;o great, and &s;o very extraordinary, that few<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> if any, had they had it in their Power<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have deny'd them&s;elves the Plea&s;ure or the World the Satisfaction of knowing it.</P>

two Hours before Day under the Hill of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> not a Quarter of a Mile from the outward Works: For this Rea&s;on it was taken for granted, whatever the De|&s;ign was which the General had propos'd to him&s;elf, that it would be put in Execution before Day-light; but the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> was now pleas'd to inform the Officers of the Rea&s;ons why he cho&s;e to &s;tay till the Light appear'd. He was of opinion that any Succe&s;s would be impo&s;|&s;ible, unle&s;s the Enemy came into the out|ward Ditch under the Ba&s;tions of the &s;econd Enclo&s;ure; but that if they had time al|low'd them to come thither, there being no Pali&s;adoes, our Men, by leaping in upon them, after receipt of their fir&s;t Fire, might drive 'em into the upper Works; and fol|lowing them clo&s;e, with &s;ome Probability, might force them, under that Confu&s;ion, in|to the inward Fortifications.</P>
<P>SUCH were the General's Rea&s;ons then and there given; after which, having promis'd ample Rewards to &s;uch as di&s;charg'd their Duty well, a Lieutenant, with thirty Men, was order'd to advance towards the Ba&s;tion neare&s;t the Town; and a Captain, with fifty Men, to &s;upport him. After the Ene|my's Fire they were to leap into the Ditch, and their Orders were to follow 'em clo&s;e, if they retir'd into the upper Works: Never|thele&s;s, not to pur&s;ue 'em farther, if they
<PB N="100" REF="107">
made into the inner Fort; but to endeavour to cover them&s;elves within the Gorge of the Ba&s;tion.</P>
<P>A LIEUTENANT and a Captain, with the like Number of Men and the &s;ame Orders, were commanded to a Demi-Ba&s;tion at the Extremity of the Fort towards the We&s;t, which was above Musket-Shot from the in|ward Fortification. Towards this Place the Wall, which was cut into the Rock, was not fac'd for about twenty Yards; and here our own Men got up; where they found three Pieces of Cannon upon a Plat|form, without any Men to defend them.</P>
<P>THOSE appointed to the Ba&s;tion towards the Town were &s;u&s;tain'd by two hundred Men; with which the General and Prince went in Per&s;on. The like Number, under the Directions of Colonel <HI>Southwell,</HI> were to &s;u&s;tain the Attack towards the We&s;t; and about five hundred Men were left under the Command of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Colonel, who&s;e Orders were to a&s;&s;i&s;t, where, in his own Judgment, he &s;hould think mo&s;t proper; and the&s;e were drawn up between the two Parties appointed to begin the A&s;&s;ault. My Lot was on the Side where the Prince and Earl were in Per&s;on; and where we &s;u|&s;tain'd the only Lo&s;s from the fir&s;t Fire of the Enemy.</P>
<P>OUR Men, though quite expos'd, and though the Glacis was all e&s;carp'd upon the
<PB N="101" REF="108">
live Rock, went on with an undaunted Courage; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Confede|rate Army attack <HI>Monjouick</HI></NOTE>and immediately after the fir&s;t Fire of the Enemy, all, that were not kill'd or wounded, leap'd in, <HI>pel-mel,</HI> a|mong&s;t the Enemy; who, being thus boldly attack'd, and &s;eeing others pouring in upon 'em, retir'd in great Confu&s;ion; and &s;ome one Way, &s;ome another, ran into the inward Works.</P>
<P>THERE was a large Port in the Flank of the principal Ba&s;tion, towards the North-Ea&s;t, and a cover'd Way, through which the General and the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> follow'd the flying Forces; and by that Means be|came po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it. Luckily enough here lay a Number of great Stones in the Gorge of the Ba&s;tion, for the U&s;e of the Fortifi|cation; with which we made a Sort of Brea&s;t-Work, before the Enemy recover'd of their Amaze, or made any con&s;iderable Fire upon us from their inward Fort, which commanded the upper Part of that Ba&s;tion.</P>
<P>WE were afterwards inform'd, that the Commander of the Citadel, expecting but one Attack, had call'd off the Men from the mo&s;t di&s;tant and we&s;tern Part of the Fort, to that Side which was next the Town; upon which our Men got into a Demi-Ba&s;tion in the mo&s;t extream Part of the Fortification. Here they got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of three Pieces of Cannon, with hardly any Oppo&s;ition; and had Lei&s;ure to ca&s;t up a little Retrenchment,
<PB N="102" REF="109">
and to make u&s;e of the Guns they had taken to defend it. Under this Situation, the Enemy, when drove into the inward Fort, were expos'd to our Fire from tho&s;e Places we were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, in ca&s;e they offer'd to make any Sally, or other Attempt again&s;t us. Thus we every Moment became better and better prepar'd again&s;t any Effort of the Garri&s;on. And as they could not pretend to a&s;&s;ail us without evident Hazard; &s;o no|thing remain'd for us to do, till we could bring up our Artillery and Mortars. Now it was that the General &s;ent for the thou&s;and Men under Brigadier <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s Command, which he had po&s;ted at a Convent, half way between the Town and <HI>Monjouick.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was almo&s;t a total Ce&s;&s;ation of Fire, the Men on both Sides being under Cover. The General was in the upper Part of the Ba&s;tion; the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> be|low, behind a little Work at the Point of the Ba&s;tion, whence he could only &s;ee the Heads of the Enemy over the Parapet of the inward Fort. Soon after an Accident happen'd which co&s;t that gallant Prince his Life.</P>
<P>THE Enemy had Lines of Communica|tion between <HI>Barcelona</HI> and <HI>Monjouick.</HI> The Governor of the former, upon hearing the firing from the latter, immediately &s;ent four hundred Dragoons on Hor&s;eback, un|der Orders, that two Hundred di&s;mounting
<PB N="103" REF="110">
&s;hould reinforce the Garri&s;on, and the other two Hundred &s;hould return with their Hor&s;es back to the Town.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e two Hundred Dragoons were accordingly got into the inward Fort, un&s;een by any of our Men, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> waving their Hats over their Heads, re|peated over and over, <HI>Viva el Rey, Viva.</HI> This the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> unfortunately took for a Signal of their De&s;ire to &s;urrender. Upon which, with too much Warmth and Precipitancy, calling to the Soldiers fol|lowing, <HI>They &s;urrender, they &s;urrender,</HI> he advanc'd with near three Hundred Men (who follow'd him without any Orders from their General) along the Curtain which led to the Ditch of the inward Fort. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Hun|dred Men taken by the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI></NOTE>The E|nemy &s;uffer'd them to come into the Ditch, and there &s;urrounding 'em, took two Hun|dred of them Pri&s;oners, at the &s;ame time making a Di&s;charge upon the re&s;t, who were running back the Way they came. This firing brought the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> down from the upper Part of the Ba&s;tion, to &s;ee what was doing below. When he had ju&s;t turn'd the Point of the Ba&s;tion, he &s;aw the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> retiring, with the Men that had &s;o ra&s;hly advanc'd. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> kill'd.</NOTE>The Earl had ex|chang'd a very few Words with him, when, from a &s;econd Fire, that Prince receiv'd a Shot in the great Artery of the Thigh, of which he died immediately, falling down
<PB N="104" REF="111">
at the General's Feet, who in&s;tantly gave Orders to carry off the Body to the next Convent.</P>
<P>ALMOST the &s;ame Moment an Officer came to acquaint the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> that a great Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, at lea&s;t three Thou&s;and, were on their March from <HI>Barcelona</HI> towards the Fort. The Di&s;tance is near a Mile, all uneven Ground; &s;o that the Enemy was either di&s;coverable, or not to be &s;een, ju&s;t as they were marching on the Hills or in the Vallies. However, the General directly got on Hor&s;e-back, to take a View of tho&s;e Forces from the ri&s;ing Ground without the Fort, having left all the Po&s;ts, which were already taken, well &s;ecur'd with the allotted Numbers of Officers and Soldiers.</P>
<P>BUT the Event will demon&s;trate of what Con&s;equence the Ab&s;ence or Pre&s;ence of one Man may prove on great Occa&s;ions: No &s;ooner was the Earl out of the Fort, the Care of which he had left under the Command of the Lord <HI>Charlemont</HI> (a Per&s;on of known Merit and undoubted Courage, but &s;ome|what too flexible in his Temper) when a panick Fear (tho' the Earl, as I have &s;aid, was only gone to take a View of the E|nemy) &s;eiz'd upon the Soldiery, which was a little too ea&s;ily comply'd with by the Lord <HI>Charlemont,</HI> then commanding Officer. True it is; for I heard an Officer, ready
<PB N="105" REF="112">
enough to take &s;uch Advantages, urge to him, that none of all tho&s;e Po&s;ts we were become Ma&s;ters of, were tenable; that to offer at it would be no better than wilfully &s;acrificing human Lives to Caprice and Hu|mour; and ju&s;t like a Man's knocking his Head again&s;t Stone Walls, to try which was harde&s;t. Having over-heard this Piece of Lip-Oratory, and finding by the An&s;wer that it was too likely to prevail, and that all I was like to &s;ay would avail nothing, I &s;lipt away as fa&s;t as I could, to acquaint the General with the Danger impending.</P>
<P>AS I pa&s;s'd along, I took notice that the Panick was upon the Increa&s;e, the ge|neral Rumor affirming, that we &s;hould be all cut off by the Troops that were come out of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> if we did not immediately gain the Hills, or the Hou&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Miquelets.</HI> Officers and Soldiers, under this prevailing Terror, quitted their Po&s;ts; and in one united Body (the Lord <HI>Charle|mont</HI> at the Head of them) march'd, or rather hurry'd out of the Fort; and were come half way down the Hill before the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> came up to them. Though on my acquainting him with the &s;hameful and &s;urprizing Accident he made no Stay; but an&s;wering, with a good deal of Vehemence, <HI>Good God, is it po&s;&s;ible?</HI> ha&s;ten'd back as fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="113">I NEVER thought my &s;elf happier than in this Piece of Service to my Country. I confe&s;s I could not but value it, as having been therein more than a little in&s;trumental in the glorious Succe&s;&s;es which &s;ucceeded; &s;ince immediately upon this Notice from me, the Earl gallop'd up the Hill, and light|ing when he came to Lord <HI>Charlemont,</HI> he took his Half-Pike out of his Hand; and turning to the Officers and Soldiers, told them, if they would not face about and follow him, they &s;hould have the Scandal and eternal Infamy upon them of having de|&s;erted their Po&s;ts, and abandon'd their Ge|neral.</P>
<P>IT was &s;urprizing to &s;ee with what Ala|crity and new Courage they fac'd about and follow'd the Earl of <HI>Peterborow.</HI> In a Moment they had forgot their Apprehen|&s;ions; and, without doubt, had they met with any Oppo&s;ition, they would have be|hav'd them&s;elves with the greate&s;t Bravery. But as the&s;e Motions were unperceiv'd by the Enemy, all the Po&s;ts were regain'd, and anew po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in le&s;s than half an Hour, without any Lo&s;s: Though, had our Forces march'd half Musket-&s;hot farther, their Re|treat would have been perceiv'd, and all the Succe&s;s attendant on this glorious At|tempt mu&s;t have been intirely bla&s;ted.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Incident which attended this happy Enterprize was this: The two hun|dred
<PB N="107" REF="114">
Men which fell into the Hands of the Enemy, by the unhappy Mi&s;take of the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> were carry'd directly into the Town. The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Risburg,</HI> a Lieutenant-General, who commanded the three thou&s;and Men which were marching from the Town to the Relief of the Fort, examin'd the Pri&s;oners, as they pa&s;s'd by; and they all agreeing that the General and the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> were in Per&s;on with the Troops that made the Attack on <HI>Monjouick,</HI> the Marqui&s;s gave immediate Orders to re|tire to the Town; taking it for granted, that the main Body of the Troops attended the Prince and General; and that &s;ome De|&s;ign therefore was on foot to intercept his Return, in ca&s;e he &s;hould venture too far. Thus the unfortunate Lo&s;s of our two hun|dred Men turn'd to our Advantage, in pre|venting the Advance of the Enemy, which mu&s;t have put the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> to in|conceivable Difficulties.</P>
<P>THE Body of one Thou&s;and, under Brigadier <HI>Stanhope,</HI> being come up to <HI>Mon|jouick,</HI> and no Interruption given us by the Enemy, our Affairs were put into very good Order on this Side; while the Camp on the other Side was &s;o fortify'd, that the Enemy, during the Siege, never made one Effort again&s;t it. In the mean time, the Communication between the two Camps was &s;ecure enough; although our Troops
<PB N="108" REF="115">
were oblig'd to a tedious March along the Foot of the Hills, whenever the General thought fit to relieve tho&s;e on Duty on the Side of the Attack, from tho&s;e Regiments encamp'd on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Barcelona.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Day, after the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> had taken Care to &s;ecure the fir&s;t Camp to the Ea&s;tward of the Town, he gave Orders to the Officers of the Fleet to land the Artillery and Ammunition behind the Fortre&s;s to the We&s;tward. Immediate|ly upon the Landing whereof, two Mortars were fix'd; from both which we ply'd the Fort of <HI>Monjouick</HI> furiou&s;ly with our Bombs. But the third or fourth Day, one of our Shells fortunately lighting on their Maga|zine of Powder, blew it up;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magazine of <HI>Mon|jouick</HI> blown up, and the Fortre&s;s taken.</NOTE> and with it the Governor, and many principal Officers who were at Dinner with him. The Bla&s;t, at the &s;ame In&s;tant, threw down a Face of one of the &s;maller Ba&s;tions; which the vigilant <HI>Mi|quelets,</HI> ready enough to take all Advantages, no &s;ooner &s;aw (for they were under the Hill, very near the Place) but they readily enter'd, while the Enemy were under the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. If the Earl, no le&s;s watchful than they, had not at the &s;ame Moment thrown him&s;elf in with &s;ome regu|lar Troops, and appeas'd the general Di&s;|order, in all probability the Garri&s;on had been put to the Sword. However, the Ge|neral's Pre&s;ence not only allay'd the Fury of
<PB N="109" REF="116">
the <HI>Miquelets</HI>; but kept his own Troops under &s;tricte&s;t Di&s;cipline: So that in a happy Hour for the frighted Garri&s;on, the Gene|ral gave Officers and Soldiers Quarters, making them Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>HOW critical was that Minute wherein the General met his retreating Commander? a very few Steps farther had excluded us our own Conque&s;ts, to the utter Lo&s;s of all tho&s;e greater Glories which en&s;u'd. Nor would that have been the wor&s;t; for be|&s;ides the Shame attending &s;uch an ill con|certed Retreat from our Acque&s;ts on <HI>Mon|jouick,</HI> we mu&s;t have felt the accumulative Di&s;grace of infamou&s;ly retiring aboard the Ships that brought us; but Heaven re&s;erv'd for our General amazing Scenes both of Glory and Mortification.</P>
<P>I CANNOT here omit one Singularity of Life, which will demon&s;trate Men's different Way of Thinking, if not &s;omewhat wor&s;e; when many Years after, to one in Office, who &s;eem'd a little too deaf to my Com|plaints, and by that Means irritating my human Pa&s;&s;ions, in Ju&s;tice to my &s;elf, as well as Cau&s;e, I urg'd this Piece of Service, by which I not only pre&s;erv'd the Place, but the Honour of my Country; that <HI>Mi|ni&s;ter petite,</HI> to mortify my Expectations and baffle my Plea, with a Grimace as odd as his Logick, return'd, that, in his Opinion, the Service pretended was a Di&s;&s;ervice to

the Nation; &s;ince Per&s;everance had co&s;t the Government more Money than all our Con|que&s;ts were worth, could we have kept 'em. So irregular are the Conceptions of Man, when even great Actions thwart the Bent of an intere&s;ted Will!</P>
<P>THE Fort of <HI>Monjouick</HI> being thus &s;ur|prizingly reduc'd, furni&s;h'd a &s;trange Viva|city to Mens Expectations, and as extrava|gantly flatter'd their Hopes; for as Succe&s;s never fails to excite weaker Minds to pur&s;ue their good Fortune, though many times to their own Lo&s;s; &s;o is it often too apt to pu&s;h on more elevated Spirits to renew the En|counter for atchieving new Conque&s;ts, by hazarding too ra&s;hly all their former Glory. Accordingly, every Body now began to make his utmo&s;t Efforts; and look'd upon him&s;elf as a Drone, if he was not employ'd in doing &s;omething or other towards pu&s;hing forward the Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> it &s;elf, and rai&s;ing proper Batteries for that Purpo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> But, after all, it mu&s;t in Ju&s;tice be ac|knowledg'd, that notwith&s;tanding this pro|digious Succe&s;s that attended this bold En|terprize, the Land Forces of them&s;elves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Sailors, could never have reduc'd the Town.

before, was their utter Aver&s;ion, and what they hated to hear of. Elated therefore with a Beginning &s;o au&s;picious, they gave a more willing A&s;&s;i&s;tance than could have been ask'd, or judiciou&s;ly expected. The Admirals forgot their Element, and acted as General Officers at Land: They came every Day from their Ships, with a Body of Men form'd into Companies, and regu|larly mar&s;hall'd and commanded by Cap|tains and Lieutenants of their own. Cap|tain <HI>Littleton</HI> in particular, one of the mo&s;t advanc'd Captains in the whole Fleet, offer'd of him&s;elf to take care of the Landing and Conveyance of the Artillery to the Camp. And an&s;werable to that his fir&s;t Zeal was his Vigour all along; for finding it next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to draw the Cannon and Mortars up &s;uch va&s;t Precipices by Hor&s;es, if the Country had afforded them, he caus'd Harne&s;&s;es to be made for two hundred Men; and by that Means, after a prodigious Fa|tigue and Labour, brought the Cannon and Mortars nece&s;&s;ary for the Siege up to the very Batteries.</P>

enough to &s;ecure our two little Camps, and pre&s;erve a Communication between both, not to be interrupted or incommoded by the Enemy. We had &s;oon erected three &s;everal Batteries again&s;t the Place, all on the We&s;t Side of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> one of nine Guns, another of Twelve, and the la&s;t of upwards of Thirty. From all which we ply'd the Town ince&s;&s;antly, and with all imaginable Fury; and very often in whole Vollies.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS it was thought not only advi&s;eable, but nece&s;&s;ary, to erect another Battery, upon a lower Piece of Ground un|der a &s;mall Hill; which lying more within Reach, and oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e Places where the Walls were imagin'd weake&s;t, would annoy the Town the more; and being de|&s;ign'd for &s;ix Guns only, might &s;oon be per|fected.

not my Enemies, &s;uppos'd, more out of Envy than good Will. However, when I came to the Place, and had carefully taken a View of it, though I was &s;en&s;ible enough of the Difficulty, I made my main Objection as to the Time for accompli&s;hing it; for it was then between Nine and Ten, and the Guns were to be mounted by Day-light. Neither could I at pre&s;ent &s;ee any other Way to an&s;wer their Expectations, than by ca&s;ting the Cannon down the Precipice, at all Hazards, to the Place below, where that fourth Battery was erected.</P>
<P>THIS wanted not Objections to; and therefore to an&s;wer my Purpo&s;e, as to point of Time, &s;ixty Men more were order'd me, as much as po&s;&s;ible to facilitate the Work by Numbers; and accordingly I &s;et about it. Ju&s;t as I was &s;etting all Hands to work, and had given Orders to my Men to begin &s;ome Paces back, to make the De&s;cent more gradual, and thereby render the Task a little more fea&s;ible, Major <HI>Collier,</HI> who commanded the Train, came to me; and perceiving the Difficulties of the Under|taking, in a Fret told me, I was impos'd upon; and vow'd he would go and find out Brigadier <HI>Petit,</HI> and let him know the Im|po&s;&s;ibility, as well as the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Task I was put upon. He had &s;carce utter'd tho&s;e Words, and turn'd him&s;elf round to perform his Promi&s;e, when an un|lucky
<PB N="114" REF="121">
Shot with a Musket-Ball wounded him through the Shoulder; upon which he was carry'd off, and I &s;aw him not till &s;ome con|&s;iderable time after.</P>
<P>BY the painful Diligence, and the addi|tional Compliment of Men, however, I &s;o well &s;ucceeded (&s;uch was my great good Fortune) that the Way was made, and the Guns, by the Help of Fa&s;cines, and other le&s;&s;er Preparations below, &s;afely let down and mounted; &s;o that that fourth Battery began to play upon the Town before Break of Day; and with all the Succe&s;s that was propos'd.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Breach in a very few Days after was found wholly practicable; and all Things were got ready for a general Storm. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> beats a Parley, and agrees to &s;urrender in three Days.</NOTE>Which Don <HI>Vala&s;co</HI> the Governor being &s;en&s;ible of, immediately beat a Parley; upon which it was, among other Articles, con|cluded, that the Town &s;hould be &s;urren|der'd in three Days; and the better to en|&s;ure it, the Ba&s;tion, which commanded the Port St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> was directly put into our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT before the Expiration of the limited three Days, a very unexpected Accident fell out, which ha&s;ten'd the Surrender. Don <HI>Vala&s;co,</HI> during his Government, had behav'd him&s;elf very arbitrarily, and there|by procur'd, as the Con&s;equence of it, a large Proportion of ill will, not only among the
<PB N="115" REF="122">
Town&s;men, but among the <HI>Miquelets,</HI> who had, in their Zeal to King <HI>Charles,</HI> flock'd from all Parts of <HI>Catalonia</HI> to the Siege of their Capital; and who, on the Signing of the Articles of Surrender, had found various Ways, being well acquainted with the mo&s;t private Avenues, to get by Night into the Town: So that early in the Morning they began to plunder all that they knew Ene|mies to King <HI>Charles,</HI> or thought Friends to the Prince his Competitor.</P>
<P>THEIR main De&s;ign was upon <HI>Vala&s;co</HI> the Governor, whom, if they could have got into their Hands, it was not to be que|&s;tion'd, but as far as his Life and Limbs would have &s;erv'd, they would have &s;uffi|ciently &s;atiated their Vengeance upon. He expected no le&s;s; and therefore concealed him&s;elf, till the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> could give Orders for his more &s;afe and private Conveyance by Sea to <HI>Alicant.</HI></P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, in the Town all was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; which the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> at the very fir&s;t hearing, ha&s;ten'd to appea&s;e; with his u&s;ual Alacrity he rid all alone to Port St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> where at that time my &s;elf happen'd to be; and de|manding to be admitted, the Officer of the Guard, under Fear and Surpri&s;e, open'd the Wicket, through which the Earl enter'd, and I after him.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="123">SCARCE had we gone a hundred Paces, when we &s;aw a Lady of apparent Quality, and indi&s;putable Beauty, in a &s;trange, but mo&s;t affecting Agony, flying from the ap|prehended Fury of the <HI>Miquelets;</HI> her lovely Hair was all flowing about her Shoulders, which, and the Con&s;ternation &s;he was in, rather added to, than any thing dimini&s;h'd from the Charms of an Exce&s;s of Beauty. She, as is very natural to People in Di&s;tre&s;s, made up directly to the Earl, her Eyes &s;atisfying her he was a Per|&s;on likely to give her all the Protection &s;he wanted. And as &s;oon as ever &s;he came near enough, in a Manner that declar'd her Quality before &s;he &s;poke, &s;he crav'd that Protection, telling him, the better to &s;e|cure it, who it was that ask'd it. But the generous Earl pre&s;ently convinc'd her, he wanted no Intreaties, having, before he knew her to be the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Popoli,</HI> taken her by the Hand, in order to convey her through the Wicket which he enter'd at, to a Place of Safety without the Town.</P>
<P>I STAY'D behind, while the Earl con|vey'd the di&s;tre&s;s'd Dutche&s;s to her reque&s;ted <HI>A&s;ylum</HI>; and I believe it was much the longe&s;t Part of an Hour before he return'd. But as &s;oon as ever he came back, he, and my &s;elf, at his Command, repair'd to the Place of mo&s;t Confu&s;ion, which the extra|ordinary Noi&s;e full readily directed us to;
<PB N="117" REF="124">
and which happen'd to be on the Parade be|fore the Palace. There it was that the <HI>Miquelets</HI> were making their utmo&s;t Efforts to get into their Hands the almo&s;t &s;ole Occa|&s;ion of the Tumult, and the Object of their raging Fury, the Per&s;on of Don <HI>Vala&s;co,</HI> the late Governor.</P>
<P>IT was here that the Earl pre&s;erv'd that Governor from the violent, but perhaps too ju&s;t Re&s;entments of the <HI>Miquelets;</HI> and, as I &s;aid before, convey'd him by Sea to <HI>Ali|cant.</HI> And, indeed, I could little doubt the Effect, or be any thing &s;urpriz'd at the Ea&s;ine&s;s of the Task, when I &s;aw, that wherever he appear'd the popular Fury was in a Moment allay'd, and that every Di|ctate of that General was a&s;&s;ented to with the utmo&s;t Chearfulne&s;s and Deference. <HI>Vala&s;co,</HI> before his Embarkment, had given Orders, in Gratitude to his Pre&s;erver, for all the Gates to be deliver'd up, tho' &s;hort of the &s;tipulated Term; and they were according|ly &s;o deliver'd, and our Troops took Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion &s;o &s;oon as ever that Governor was a|board the Ship that was to convey him to <HI>Alicant.</HI></P>
<P>DURING the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> Bri|gadier <HI>Stanhope</HI> order'd a Tent to be pitch'd as near the Trenches as po&s;&s;ibly could be with Safety; where he not only entertain'd the chief Officers who were upon Duty, but likewi&s;e the <HI>Catalonian</HI> Gentlemen who
<PB N="118" REF="125">
brought <HI>Miquelets</HI> to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I re|member I &s;aw an old Cavalier, having his only Son with him, who appear'd a fine young Gentleman, about twenty Years of Age, go into the Tent, in order to dine with the Brigadier. But whil&s;t they were at Dinner, an unfortunate Shot came from the Ba&s;tion of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> and intirely &s;truck off the Head of the Son. The Fa|ther immediately ro&s;e up, fir&s;t looking down upon his headle&s;s Child, and then lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, whil&s;t the Tears ran down his Cheeks, he cro&s;s'd him&s;elf, and only &s;aid, <HI>Fiat voluntas tua,</HI> and bore it with a wonderful Patience. 'Twas a &s;ad Spectacle, and truly it affects me now whil&s;t I am writing.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> tho' for &s;ome time after the Revolution he had been em|ploy'd in civil Affairs, return'd to the mili|tary Life with great Satisfaction, which was ever his Inclination. Brigadier <HI>Stanhope,</HI> who was ju&s;tly afterwards created an Earl, did well de&s;erve this Motto, <HI>Tam Marte quam Mercurio</HI>; for truly he behav'd, all the time he continu'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> as if he had been in|&s;pir'd with Conduct; for the Victory at <HI>Al|manar</HI> was intirely owing to him; and likewi&s;e at the Battle of <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> he di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd him&s;elf with great Bravery. That he had not Succe&s;s at <HI>Bruhega</HI> was not his Fault; for no Man can re&s;i&s;t Fate; for 'twas
<PB N="119" REF="126">
decreed by Heaven that <HI>Philip</HI> &s;hould re|main King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> to be Em|peror of <HI>Germany.</HI> Yet each of the&s;e Mo|narchs have been ungrateful to the In&s;tru|ments which the Almighty made u&s;e of to pre&s;erve them upon their Thrones; for one had not been King of <HI>Spain</HI> but for <HI>France</HI>; and the other had not been Emperor but for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barcelona,</HI> the chief Place in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> being thus in our Hands, as &s;oon as the Garri&s;on, little inferior to our Army, had march'd out with Drums beating, Colours flying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the Articles, <HI>Charles</HI> the Third made his publick Entry, and was proclaim'd King, and receiv'd with the general Acclamations, and all other Demon&s;trations of Joy &s;uitable to that great Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Rejoycings.</NOTE>SOME Days after which, the Citizens, far from being &s;atiated with their former Demon&s;trations of their Duty, &s;ent a Peti|tion to the King, by proper Deputies for that Purpo&s;e appointed, de&s;iring Leave to give more ample In&s;tances of their Affections in a publick <HI>Cavalcade.</HI> The King granted their Reque&s;t, and the Citizens, pur&s;uant thereto, made their Preparations.</P>
<P>ON the Day appointed, the King, plac'd in a Balcony belonging to the Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> appear'd ready to ho|nour the Show. The Ceremonial, to &s;peak
<PB N="120" REF="127">
nothing figuratively, was very fine and grand: Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Rank made their Appearance in decent Order, and upon fine Hor&s;es; and others under Arms, and in Companies, march'd with native Gravity and Grandeur, all &s;aluting his Maje&s;ty as they pa&s;s'd by, after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Manner, which that Prince return'd with the Move|ment of his Hand to his Mouth; for the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> are not allow'd to &s;alute, or return a Salute, by any Motion to, or of, the Hat.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e follow'd &s;everal Pageants; the fir&s;t of which was drawn by Mules, &s;et off to the Height with &s;tatelie&s;t Feathers, and adorn'd with little Bells. Upon the Top of this Pageant appear'd a Man dre&s;s'd all in Green; but in the Likene&s;s of a Dragon. The Pageant making a Stop ju&s;t over-again&s;t the Balcony where the King &s;ate, the Dra|gonical Repre&s;entative diverted him with great Variety of Dancings, the Earl of <HI>Pe|terborow</HI> all the time throwing out Dollars by Handfuls among the Populace, which they as con&s;tantly receiv'd with the loud Acclamation and repeated Cries of <HI>Viva, Viva, Carlos Terceros, Viva la Ca&s;a d' Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN that had play'd its Part, another Pageant, drawn as before, made a like full Stop before the &s;ame Balcony. On this was plac'd a very large Cage, or Aviary, the
<PB N="121" REF="128">
Cover of which, by Springs contriv'd for that Purpo&s;e, immediately flew open, and out of it a &s;urprizing Flight of Birds of va|rious Colours. The&s;e, all amaz'd at their &s;udden Liberty, which I took to be the Emblem intended, hover'd a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time over and about their Place of Freedom, chirping, &s;inging, and otherwi&s;e te&s;tifying their mighty Joy for their &s;o un|expected Enlargement.</P>
<P>THERE were many other Pageants; but having little in them very remarkable, I have forgot the Particulars. Neverthele&s;s, every one of them was di&s;mi&s;s'd with the like Acclamations of <HI>Viva, Viva</HI>; the Whole concluding with Bonfires and Illu|minations common on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I CANNOT here omit one very remark|able In&s;tance of the Catholick Zeal of that Prince, which I was &s;oon after an Eye-witne&s;s of. I was at that time in the Fruit-Market, when the King pa&s;&s;ing by in his Coach, the Ho&s;t (whether by Accident or Contrivance I cannot &s;ay) was brought, at that very Juncture, out of the great Church, in order, as I after under&s;tood, to a poor &s;ick Woman's receiving the Sacrament. On Sight of the Ho&s;t the King came out of his Coach, kneel'd down in the Street, which at that time prov'd to be very dirty, till the Ho&s;t pa&s;s'd by; then ro&s;e up, and taking the lighted Flambeau from him who
<PB N="122" REF="129">
bore it, he follow'd the Prie&s;t up a &s;treight na&s;ty Alley, and there up a dark ordinary Pair of Stairs, where the poor &s;ick Woman lay. There he &s;tay'd till the whole Cere|mony was over, when, returning to the Door of the Church, he very faithfully re|&s;tor'd the lighted Flambeau to the Fellow he had taken it from, the People all the while crying out <HI>Viva, Viva</HI>; an Acclamation, we may imagine, intended to his Zeal, as well as his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remarkable Accident, of a much more moral Nature, I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to the Temperance of that, in this truly inimitable People, recite. I was one Day walking in one of the mo&s;t populous Streets of that City, where I found an uncommon Concour&s;e of People, of all Sorts, got to|gether; and imagining &s;o great a Croud could not be a&s;&s;embled on a &s;mall Occa&s;ion, I pre&s;t in among the re&s;t; and after a good deal of Struggling and Difficulty, reach'd into the Ring and Centre of that mix'd Mul|titude. But how did I blu&s;h? with what Confu&s;ion did I appear? when I found one of my own Countrymen, a drunken Grana|dier, the attractive Load&s;tone of all that high and low Mob, and the Butt of all their Merriment? It will be ea&s;ily imagin'd to be a Thing not a little &s;urprizing to one of our Country, to find that a drunken Man &s;hould be &s;uch a wonderful Sight: How|ever,
<PB N="123" REF="130">
the witty Sarca&s;ms that were then by high and low thrown upon that &s;en&s;ele&s;s Creature, and as I interpreted Matters, me in him, were &s;o pungent, that if I did not cur&s;e my Curio&s;ity, I thought it be&s;t to withdraw my &s;elf as fa&s;t as Legs could carry me away.</P>
<P><HI>BARCELONA</HI> being now under King <HI>Charles,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Gironne, Tarragona, Torto&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Lerida,</HI> immediately declar'd for him. To every one of which Enge|neers being order'd, it was my Lot to be &s;ent to <HI>Torto&s;a.</HI> This Town is &s;ituated on the Side of the River <HI>Ebro,</HI> over which there is a fair and famous Bridge of Boats. The Waters of this River are always of a dirty red Colour, &s;omewhat fouler than our Moori&s;h Waters; yet is it the only Water the Inhabitants drink, or covet to drink; and every Hou&s;e providing for its own Con|venience Ci&s;terns to pre&s;erve it in, by a few Hours &s;tanding it becomes as clear as the cleare&s;t Rock-water, but as &s;oft as Milk. In &s;hort, for Softne&s;s, Brightne&s;s, and Plea&s;antne&s;s of Ta&s;te, the Natives pre|fer it to all the Waters in the World. And I mu&s;t declare in favour of their Opinion, that none ever pleas'd me like it.</P>
<P>THIS Town was of the greater Moment to our Army, as opening a Pa&s;&s;age into the Kingdom of <HI>Valencia</HI> on one Side, and the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon</HI> on the other: And be|ing
<PB N="124" REF="131">
of it &s;elf tolerably defen&s;ible, in human Appearance might probably repay a little Care and Charge in its Repair and Improve|ment. Upon this Employ was I appointed, and thus was I bu&s;y'd, till the Arrival of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> with his little Army, in order to march to <HI>Valencia,</HI> the Capital of that Province. Here he left in Garri&s;on Colonel <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI>'s Regiment; the Place, neverthele&s;s, was under the Com|mand of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, appointed by King <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE the Earl &s;tay'd a few Days at this Place, under Expectation of the promis'd Succours from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he re|ceiv'd <HI>a Proprio</HI> (or Expre&s;s) from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> full of Excu&s;es, in&s;tead of Forces. And yet the very &s;ame Letter, in a paradoxical Manner, commanded him, at all Events, to attempt the Relief of <HI>Santo Mattheo,</HI> where Colonel <HI>Jones</HI> commanded, and which was then under Siege by the <HI>Conde de los Torres</HI> (as was the Report) with upwards of three thou&s;and Men. The Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> could not mu&s;ter above one thou&s;and Foot, and about two hundred Hor&s;e; a &s;mall Force to make an Attempt of that Nature upon &s;uch a &s;uperior Power: Yet the Earl's Vivacity (as will be occa|&s;ionally further ob&s;erv'd in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Memoirs) never much regarded Num|bers, &s;o there was but room, by any Stra|tagem,
<PB N="125" REF="132">
to hope for Succe&s;s. True it is, for his greater Encouragement and Con&s;olation, the &s;ame Letter intimated, that a great Concour&s;e of the Country People being up in Arms, to the Number of many Thou|&s;ands, in Favour of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and wanting only Officers, the Enterprize would be ea&s;y, and unattended with much Danger. But upon mature Enquiry, the Earl found that great Body of Men all <HI>in nubibus;</HI> and that the <HI>Conde,</HI> in the plain Truth of the Matter, was much &s;tronger than the Letter at fir&s;t repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><HI>SANTO Mattheo</HI> was a Place of known Importance; and that from its Situation, which cut off all Communication between <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Valencia;</HI> and, con&s;equently, &s;hould it fall into the Hands of the Enemy, the Earl's De&s;ign upon the latter mu&s;t inevi|tably have been po&s;tpon'd. It mu&s;t be granted, the Commands for attempting the Relief of it were pre&s;&s;ing and peremptory; neverthele&s;s, the Earl was very con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that as the promis'd Reinforce|ments were &s;u&s;pended, his Officers would not approve of the Attempt upon the Foot of &s;uch va&s;t Inequalities; and their own de|clar'd Sentiments &s;oon confirm'd the Dictates of the Earl's Rea&s;on. He therefore ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to tho&s;e Officers in a different Manner: He told 'em he only de&s;ir'd they would be pa&s;&s;ive, and leave it to him to

Accordingly, the Earl found out and hired two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Spies, for who&s;e Fidelity (as his great Precaution al|ways led him to do) he took &s;ufficient Se|curity; and di&s;patch'd 'em with a Letter to Colonel <HI>Jones,</HI> Governor of the Place, in|timating his Readine&s;s, as well as Ability, to relieve him; and, above all, exhorting him to have the <HI>Miquelets</HI> in the Town ready, on Sight of his Troops, to i&s;&s;ue out, pur&s;ue, and plunder; &s;ince that would be all they would have to do, and all he would expect at their Hands.

<P><HI>SANTO Mattheo</HI> being reliev'd, as I have &s;aid, the Earl, though he had &s;o far gain'd his Ends, left not the flying Enemy without a Feint of Pur&s;uit; with &s;uch Cau|tion, neverthele&s;s, that in ca&s;e they &s;hould happen to be better inform'd of his Weak|ne&s;s, he might have a Re&s;ource either back again to <HI>Santo Mattheo,</HI> or to <HI>Vinaros</HI> on the Sea-&s;ide; or &s;ome other Place, as occa|&s;ion might require.

<P>PURSUANT to this Re&s;olution of the Council of War, the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI>

tho' &s;till intent upon his Expedition into <HI>Valencia</HI> (which had been afre&s;h com|manded, even while his Supplies were countermanded) orders his Foot, in a truly bad Condition, by tedious Marches Day and Night over the Mountains, to <HI>Vinaros</HI>; and with his two hundred Hor&s;e, &s;et out to pro|&s;ecute his pretended De&s;ign of pur&s;uing the flying Enemy; re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, not|with&s;tanding all &s;eemingly de&s;perate Cir|cum&s;tances, to perfect the Security of that Capital.</P>
<P>TO that Purpo&s;e, the Earl, with his &s;mall Body of Patrolers, went on frightning the Enemy, till they came under the Walls of <HI>Nules,</HI> a Town fortify'd with the be&s;t Walls, regular Towers, and in the be&s;t Re|pair of any in that Kingdom.

But bold as the Undertaking was, his good Genius went along with him; and &s;o good a Genius was it, that it rarely left him without a good Effect. He had
<PB N="129" REF="136">
been told the Day before, that the Enemy, on leaving <HI>Nules,</HI> had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Villa Real,</HI> where they put all to the Sword. What would have furni&s;h'd another with Terror, in&s;pir'd his Lord&s;hip with a Thought as fortunate as it was &s;ucce&s;sful. The Earl rides up to the very Gates of the Town, at the Head of his Party, and peremptorily de|mands the chief Magi&s;trate, or a Prie&s;t, im|mediately to be &s;ent out to him; and that un|der Penalty of being all put to the Sword, and us'd as the Enemy had us'd tho&s;e at <HI>Villa-Real</HI> the Day or two before. The Troops, that had &s;o lately left the Place, had left behind 'em more Terror than Men; which, together with the peremptory Demand of the Earl, &s;oon produc'd &s;ome Prie&s;ts to wait upon the General. By their Readine&s;s to obey, the Earl very ju&s;tly imagin'd Fear to be the Motive; wherefore, to improve their Terror, he only allow'd them &s;ix Minutes time to re&s;olve upon a Surrender, telling them, that otherwi&s;e, &s;o &s;oon as his Artillery was come up, he would lay them under the utmo&s;t Extremities.

<P><PB N="130" REF="137">THE News of the taking of <HI>Nules</HI> &s;oon overtook the flying Enemy; and &s;o in|creas'd the Apprehen&s;ions of their Danger, that they renew'd their March the &s;ame Day; though what they had taken before would have &s;atisfy'd them much better without it. On the other hand, the Earl was &s;o well pleas'd with his Succe&s;s, that leaving the Enemy to fly before their Fears, he made a &s;hort Turn towards <HI>Ca&s;tillon de la Plana,</HI> a con&s;iderable, but open Town, where his Lord&s;hip furni&s;h'd him&s;elf with four hundred Hor&s;es more; and all this un|der the A&s;&s;urance that his Troops were driving the Enemy before them out of the Kingdom.

<P>AT <HI>Vinaros</HI> the Earl met with Advice, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Militia of the Kingdom of <HI>Valencia</HI> were a&s;&s;embled, and had already advanc'd a Day's March at lea&s;t into that Country. Upon which, collecting, as fa&s;t as he could, the whole Corps together, the

of Faith, or the Brand of Cowardice, cho&s;e to &s;acrifice them&s;elves, their Wives, Children, and all that was dear to them, in the Flames of their expiring City.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Molviedro,</HI> as I &s;aid before, <HI>Mahoni</HI> commanded, with eight hundred Men, be|&s;ides Inhabitants; which, together with our having but little Artillery, induc'd the Officers under the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> rea&s;onably enough to imagine and declare, that there could be no vi&s;ible Appearance of &s;urmounting &s;uch Difficulties. The Earl, neverthele&s;s, in&s;tead of indulging &s;uch De|&s;pondencies, gave them Hope, that what Strength &s;erv'd not to accompli&s;h, Art might po&s;&s;ibly obtain. To that Purpo&s;e he pro|po&s;ed an Interview between him&s;elf and <HI>Mahoni</HI>; and accordingly &s;ent an Officer with a Trumpet to intimate his De&s;ire. The Motion was agreed to; and the Earl having previou&s;ly &s;tation'd his Troops to advantage, and his little Artillery at a convenient Di|&s;tance, with Orders they &s;hould appear on a &s;low March on the Side of a ri&s;ing Hill, during the time of Conference, went to the Place appointed; only, as had been &s;tipu|lated, attended with a &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e. When they were met, the Earl fir&s;t offer'd all he could to engage <HI>Mahoni</HI> to the In|tere&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI>; propo&s;ing &s;ome Things extravagant enough (as <HI>Mahoni</HI> him&s;elf &s;ome time after told me) to &s;tagger
<PB N="133" REF="140">
the Faith of a Catholick; but all to little Purpo&s;e: <HI>Mahoni</HI> was inflexible, which oblig'd the Earl to new Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the Earl frankly told him, that he could not however but e&s;teem the Confidence he had put in him; and there|fore, to make &s;ome Retaliation, he was ready to put it in his Power to avoid the Barbarities lately executed at <HI>Villa-Real.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"My Relation to you, continued the Gene|ral, inclines me to &s;pare a Town under your Command.

Barbarities, however ju&s;tified by Example, are my utter Aver&s;ion, and again&s;t my Nature; and to te&s;tify &s;o much, together with my good Will to your Per|&s;on, was the main Intent of this Interview."</Q></P>
<P>THIS Frankne&s;s &s;o far prevail'd on <HI>Ma|honi,</HI> that he agreed to return an An&s;wer in half an Hour. Accordingly, an An&s;wer was return'd by a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Officer, and a Ca|pitulation agreed upon; the Earl at the &s;ame time endeavouring to bring over that Officer to King <HI>Charles,</HI> on much the &s;ame Topicks he us'd with <HI>Mahoni.</HI> But finding this equally fruitle&s;s, whether it was that he tacitly reproach'd the Officer with a Want
<PB N="134" REF="141">
of Con&s;ideration in neglecting to follow the Example of his Commander, or what el&s;e, he created in that Officer &s;uch a Jealou&s;y of <HI>Mahoni,</HI> that was afterward very &s;ervice|able to him in his further De&s;ign.</P>
<P>TO forward which to a good I&s;&s;ue, the Earl immediately made choice of two Dra|goons, who, upon promi&s;e of Promotion, undertook to go as Spies to the Duke of <HI>Arcos,</HI> who&s;e Forces lay not far off, on the other Side a large Plain, which the Earl mu&s;t unavoidably pa&s;s, and which would inevitably be attended with almo&s;t in&s;uper|able Dangers, if there attack'd by a Force &s;o much &s;uperior. Tho&s;e Spies, according to In&s;tructions, were to di&s;cover to the Duke, that they over-heard the Conference between the Earl and <HI>Mahoni</HI>; and at the &s;ame time &s;aw a con&s;iderable Number of Pi&s;toles deliver'd into <HI>Mahoni</HI>'s Hands, large Promi&s;es pa&s;&s;ing at that In&s;tant reci|procally: But above all, that the Earl had recommended to him the procuring the March of the Duke over the Plain between them. The Spies went and deliver'd all ac|cording to Concert; concluding, before the Duke, that they would ask no Reward, but undergo any Puni&s;hment, if <HI>Mahoni</HI> did not very &s;oon &s;end to the Duke a Reque&s;t to march over the Plain, in order to put the concerted Plot in execution. It was not long after this pretended Di&s;covery be|fore
<PB N="135" REF="142">
<HI>Mahoni</HI> did &s;end indeed an Officer to the Duke, de&s;iring the March of his Forces over the Plain; but, in reality, to ob&s;truct the Earl's Pa&s;&s;age, which he knew very well mu&s;t be that and no other way. How|ever, the Duke being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Spies, and what tho&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Officers that at fir&s;t e&s;cap'd had before infus'd, took Things in their Sen&s;e; and as &s;oon as <HI>Mahoni,</HI> who was forc'd to make the be&s;t of his way over the Plain before the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> arriv'd at his Camp, he was put under Arre&s;t and &s;ent to <HI>Madrid.</HI> The Duke having thus imbib'd the Venom, and taken the Alarm, immediately decamp'd in Con|fu&s;ion, and took a different Rout than at fir&s;t he intended; leaving that once formidable Plain open to the Earl, without an Enemy to ob&s;truct him. In &s;ome little time after he arriv'd at <HI>Madrid, Mahoni</HI> made his Inno|cence appear, and was created a General; while the Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> was recall'd from his Po&s;t of Honour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl's Entry into the City of <HI>Valencia.</HI></NOTE>THE Day after we arriv'd at <HI>Valencia,</HI> the Gates of which fine City were &s;et open to us with the highe&s;t Demon&s;trations of Joy.

Not that other Parts of this Nation are uninfe&s;ted with this &s;ort of Animals; but here their Numbers are &s;o great, that if a Catalogue was to be taken of tho&s;e in o|ther Parts of that Country, perhaps nine in ten would be found by Birth to be of this Province.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed, tho' the Citizens, and all Sorts of People, were redundant in their various Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy, for an Entry &s;o &s;urprizing, and utterly lo&s;t to their Expecta|tion, whatever it was to their Wi&s;hes, the Earl had a &s;ecret Concern for the Publick, which lay gnawing at his Heart, and which yet he was forced to conceal. He knew that he had not four thou&s;and Soldiers in the Place, and not Powder or Ammunition for tho&s;e; nor any Provi&s;ions lay'd in for any thing like a Siege. On the other Hand, the E|nemy without were upwards of &s;even Thou|&s;and, with a Body of four Thou&s;and more,
<PB N="137" REF="144">
not fifteen Leagues off, on their March to join them. Add to this, the Mare&s;chal de <HI>The&s;&s;e</HI> was no farther off than <HI>Madrid,</HI> a very few Days March from <HI>Valencia</HI>; a &s;hort Way indeed for the Earl (who, as was &s;aid before, was wholly unprovided for a Siege, which was reported to be the &s;ole End of the Mare&s;chal's moving that Way.) But the Earl's never-failing Genius re&s;olv'd again to attempt that by Art, which the Strength of his Forces utterly di&s;allow'd him. And in the fir&s;t Place, his Intelli|gence telling him that &s;ixteen twenty-four Pounders, with Stores and Ammunition an&s;werable for a Siege, were &s;hip'd off for the Enemy's Service at <HI>Alicant,</HI> the Earl forthwith lays a De&s;ign, and with his u&s;ual Succe&s;s intercepts 'em all, &s;upplying that way his own Nece&s;&s;ities at the Expence of the Enemy.</P>
<P>THE four thou&s;and Men ready to rein|force the Troops nearer <HI>Valencia,</HI> were the next Point to be undertaken; but <HI>hic labor, hoc opus</HI>; &s;ince the greater Body under the Conde <HI>de las Torres</HI> (who, with <HI>Mahoni,</HI> was now rein&s;tated in his Po&s;t) lay between the Earl and tho&s;e Troops intended to be di&s;pers'd. And what inhaunc'd the Diffi|culty, the River <HI>Xucar</HI> mu&s;t be pa&s;s'd in al|mo&s;t the Face of the Enemy. Great Di&s;|advantages as the&s;e were, they did not di&s;|courage the Earl. He detach'd by Night
<PB N="138" REF="145">
four hundred Hor&s;e and eight hundred Foot who march'd with &s;uch ha&s;ty Silence, that they &s;urpriz'd that great Body, routed 'em,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;mall Party of the Earl's routs a Body of four Thou|&s;and.</NOTE> and brought into <HI>Valencia</HI> &s;ix hundred Pri|&s;oners very &s;afely, notwith&s;tanding they were oblig'd, under the &s;ame Night-Covert, to pa&s;s very near a Body of three Thou&s;and of the Enemy's Hor&s;e. Such a prodigious Victory would hardly have gain'd Credit in that City, if the Pri&s;oners brought in had not been living Witne&s;&s;es of the Action as well as the Triumph. The Conde <HI>de las Torres,</HI> upon the&s;e two military Rebuffs, drew off to a more convenient Di&s;tance, and left the Earl a little more at ea&s;e in his new Quarters.</P>
<P>HERE the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> made his Re&s;idence for &s;ome time. He was extream|ly well belov'd; his affable Behaviour ex|acted as much from all; and he pre&s;erv'd &s;uch a good Corre&s;pondence with the Prie&s;ts and the Ladies, that he never fail'd of the mo&s;t early and be&s;t Intelligence, a thing by no means to be &s;lighted in the common Cour&s;e of Life; but much more commendable and nece&s;&s;ary in a General, with &s;o &s;mall an Army, at open War, and in the Heart of his Enemy's Country.</P>
<P>THE Earl, by this Means; &s;ome &s;mall time after, receiving early Intelligence that King <HI>Philip</HI> was actually on his March to <HI>Bar|celona,</HI> with an Army of upwards of twenty
<PB N="139" REF="146">
five thou&s;and Men, under the Command of a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France,</HI> began his March to|wards <HI>Catalonia,</HI> with all the Troops that he could gather together, leaving in <HI>Va|lencia</HI> a &s;mall Body of Foot, &s;uch as in that Exigence could be&s;t be &s;par'd. The whole Body thus collected made very little more than two thou&s;and Foot and &s;ix hundred Hor&s;e; yet re&s;olutely with the&s;e he &s;ets out for <HI>Barcelona</HI>: In the Neighbourhood of which, as &s;oon as he arriv'd, he took care to po&s;t him&s;elf and his diminutive Army in the Mountains which inviron that City; where he not only &s;ecur'd 'em again&s;t the Enemy; but found him&s;elf in a Capacity of putting him under perpetual Alarms. Nor was the Mare&s;chal, with his great Army, capable of returning the Earl's Compliment of Di&s;turbance; &s;ince he him&s;elf, every &s;ix or eight Hours, put his Troops into &s;uch a varying Situation, that always when mo&s;t arduou&s;ly &s;ought, he was farthe&s;t off from being found. In this Manner the General bitterly harra&s;s'd the Troops of the Enemy; and by the&s;e Means &s;truck a perpetual Ter|ror into the Be&s;iegers. Nor did he only this way annoy the Enemy; the Precautions he had us'd, and the Mea&s;ures he had taken in other Places, with a View to prevent their Return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> though the Invi|dious endeavour'd to bury them in Oblivion, having equally contributed to the driving

of the Mare&s;chal of <HI>France,</HI> and his Catho|lick King, out of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>BUT to go on with the Siege: The Breaches in the Walls of that City, during its Siege by the Earl, had been put into tolerable Repair; but tho&s;e of <HI>Monjouick,</HI> on the contrary, had been as much neglect|ed. However, the Garri&s;on made &s;hift to hold out a Battery of twenty-three Days, with no le&s;s than fifty Pieces of Cannon; when, after a Lo&s;s of the Enemy of upwards of three thou&s;and Men (a Moiety of the Army employ'd again&s;t it when the Earl took it) they were forc'd to &s;urrender at Di&s;cretion.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monjouick</HI> taken by the Mare&s;|chal of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> And this cannot but merit our Ob&s;ervation, that a Place, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General took in little more than an Hour, and with very incon&s;iderable Lo&s;s, afforded the Mare&s;chal of <HI>France</HI> a Re&s;i|&s;tance of twenty-three Days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Barcelona</HI> be&s;ieg'd.</NOTE>UPON the taking of Fort <HI>Monjouick,</HI> the Mare&s;chal <HI>de The&s;s</HI> gave immediate Orders for Batteries to be rais'd again&s;t the Town. Tho&s;e Orders were put in Execution with all Expedition; and at the &s;ame time his Army fortify'd them&s;elves with &s;uch En|trenchments, as would have ruin'd the Earl's former little Army to have rais'd, or his pre|&s;ent much le&s;&s;er Army to have attempted the forcing them. However, they &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated their Apprehen&s;ions of that watchful General, who lay hovering over
<PB N="141" REF="148">
their Heads upon the Mountains. Their main Effort was to make a Breach between Port St. <HI>Antonio</HI> and that Breach which our Forces had made the Year before; to effect which they took care to ply them very di|ligently both from Cannon and Mortars; and in &s;ome few Days their Application was an&s;wer'd with a practicable Breach for a Storm. Which however was prudently deferr'd for &s;ome time, and that thro' fear of the Earl's falling on the Back of them whenever they &s;hould attempt it; which, con&s;equently, they were &s;en&s;ible might put them into &s;ome dangerous Di&s;order.</P>
<P>AND now it was that the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> re&s;olv'd to put in practice the Re&s;o|lution he had &s;ome time before concerted within him&s;elf. About nine or ten Days be|fore the Rai&s;ing of the Siege, he had receiv'd an Expre&s;s from Brigadier <HI>Stanhope</HI> (who was aboard Sir <HI>John Leake</HI>'s Fleet appoint|ed for the Relief of the Place, with the Reinforcements from <HI>England</HI>) acquainting the Earl, that he had us'd all po&s;&s;ible En|deavours to prevail on the Admiral to make the be&s;t of his way to <HI>Barcelona.</HI> But that the Admiral, however, per&s;i&s;ted in a po&s;i|tive Re&s;olution not to attempt the <HI>French</HI> Fleet before that Place under the Count <HI>de Tholou&s;e,</HI> till the Ships were join'd him which were expected from <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>George Bing.</HI> True

it was, the Fleet under Admiral <HI>Leake</HI> was of equal Strength with that under the <HI>French</HI> Admiral; but jealous of the Infor|mations he had receiv'd, and too ready to conclude that People in Di&s;tre&s;s were apt to make Repre&s;entations too much in their own Favour; he held him&s;elf, in point of Di&s;cretion, oblig'd not to hazard the Queen's Ships, when a Reinforcement of both cleaner and larger were under daily Expectation.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy Circum&s;tance (notwith|&s;tanding all former glorious Deliverances) had almo&s;t brought the Earl to the Brink of De&s;pair; and to increa&s;e it, the Earl every Day receiv'd &s;uch Commands from the King within the Place, as mu&s;t have &s;a|crificed his few Forces, without the lea&s;t Probability of &s;ucceeding. Tho&s;e all tended to his forcing his Way into the Town; when, in all human Appearance, not one Man of all that &s;hould make the Attempt could have done it, with any Hope or Pro|&s;pect of &s;urviving. The <HI>French</HI> were &s;trong|ly encamp'd at the Foot of the Mountains, di&s;tant two Miles from <HI>Barcelona</HI>; towards the Bottom of tho&s;e Hills, the Avenues into the Plain were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and fortify'd by great Detachments from the Enemy's Army.

<P>NEVERTHELESS, when Brigadier <HI>Stan|hope</HI> &s;ent that Expre&s;s to the Earl, which I ju&s;t now mention'd, he a&s;&s;ur'd him in the &s;ame, that he would u&s;e his utmo&s;t Dili|gence, both by Sea and Land, to let him have timely Notice of the Conjunction of the Fleets, which was now all they had to de|pend upon. Adding withal, that if the Earl &s;hould at any time receive a Letter, or Paper, though directed to no Body, and with nothing in it, but a half Sheet of Paper cut in the Middle, he, the Earl, might cer|tainly depend upon it, that the two Fleets were join'd, and making the be&s;t of their Way for <HI>Barcelona.</HI> It will ea&s;ily be ima|gin'd the Expre&s;s was to be well paid; and being made &s;en&s;ible that he ran little or no Hazard in carrying a Piece of blank Paper, he undertook it, and as fortunately arriv'd

with it to the Earl, at a Moment when Chagrin and De&s;pair might have hurry'd him to &s;ome Re&s;olution that might have prov'd fatal. The Me&s;&s;enger him&s;elf, how|ever, knew nothing of the Joining of the Fleets, or the Meaning of his Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> re|ceiv'd this welcome Me&s;&s;age from Brigadier <HI>Stanhope,</HI> he march'd the very &s;ame Night, with his whole little Body of Forces, to a Town on the Sea-Shore, call'd <HI>Sigeth.</HI> No Per&s;on gue&s;s'd the Rea&s;on of his March, or knew any thing of what the Intent of it was. The Officers, as formerly, obey'd without Enquiry; for they were led to it by &s;o many unaccountable Varieties of Succe&s;s, that Affiance became a &s;econd Nature, both in Officer and Soldier.</P>
<P>THE Town of <HI>Sigeth</HI> was about &s;even Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Barcelona</HI>; where, as &s;oon as the Earl with his Forces arriv'd, he took care to &s;ecure all the &s;mall Fi&s;hing-Boats, <HI>Feluccas,</HI> and <HI>Satt&eacute;es;</HI> nay, in a Word, every Machine in which he could tran&s;port any of his Men: So that in two Days time he had got together a Num|ber &s;ufficient for the Conveyance of all his Foot.</P>

<PB N="145" REF="152">
Impatient of Delay, and fearful of the Fleets pa&s;&s;ing by without his Knowledge, the Earl &s;ummon'd them together a little before Night, at which time he di&s;cover'd to the whole A&s;&s;embly, that he him&s;elf was oblig'd to endeavour to get aboard the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet; and that, if po&s;&s;ible, before the <HI>French</HI> Scouts &s;hould be able to make any Di&s;co|very of their Strength: That finding him|&s;elf of no further U&s;e on Shore, having al|ready taken the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions for their Tran&s;portation and Security, they had nothing to do but to pur&s;ue his Orders, and make the be&s;t of their Way to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> in the Ve&s;&s;els which he had provided for them: That they might do this in perfect Security when they &s;aw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet pa&s;s by; or if they &s;hould pa&s;s by in the Night, an Engagement with the <HI>French,</HI> which would be an inevitable Con&s;equence, would give them &s;ufficient Notice what they had to do further.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying, made the Officers ten times more curious: But when they &s;aw their General going with a Re&s;olution to lie out all Night at Sea, in an open Boat, attended with only one Officer; and under&s;tood that he in|tended to row out in his <HI>Felucca</HI> five or &s;ix Leagues di&s;tance from the Shore; it is hardly to be expre&s;s'd what Amazement and Con|cern &s;urpriz'd them all. Mr. <HI>Crow,</HI> the
<PB N="146" REF="153">
Queen's Mini&s;ter, and others, expre&s;s'd a par|ticular Di&s;like and Unea&s;ine&s;s; but all to no purpo&s;e, the Earl had re&s;olv'd upon it. Ac|cordingly, at Night he put out to Sea in his open <HI>Felucca,</HI> all which he &s;pent five Leagues from Shore, with no other Com|pany than one Captain and his Rowers.</P>
<P>IN the Morning, to the great Satisfaction of all, Officers and others, the Earl came again to Land; and immediately began to put his Men into the &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els which lay ready in Port for that Purpo&s;e. But at Night their Amaze was renew'd, when they found their General ready to put in execu|tion his old Re&s;olution, in the &s;ame Equi|page, and with the &s;ame Attendance. Ac|cordingly, he again <HI>felucca'd</HI> him&s;elf; and they &s;aw him no more till they were landed on the Mole in <HI>Barcelona.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> fir&s;t en|gag'd him&s;elf in the Expedition to <HI>Spain,</HI> he propos'd to the Queen and her Mini&s;try; that Admiral <HI>Shovel</HI> might be join'd in Com|mi&s;&s;ion with him in the Command of the Fleet. But this Year, when the Fleet came through the <HI>Straites,</HI> under Vice-Admiral <HI>Leake,</HI> the Queen had &s;ent a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> for the full Command, whenever he thought fit to come aboard in Per&s;on. This it was that made the General endeavour, at all Hazards, to get aboard the Fleet by Night; for he
<PB N="147" REF="154">
was apprehen&s;ive, and the Sequel prov'd his Apprehen&s;ions too well grounded, that Admiral <HI>Leake</HI> would make his Appearance with the whole Body of the Fleet, which made near twice the Number of the Ships of the Enemy; in which Ca&s;e it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Count <HI>de Tholou&s;e,</HI> as &s;oon as ever the <HI>French</HI> Scouts &s;hould give Notice of our Strength, would cut his Cables and put out to Sea, to avoid an En|gagement. On the other hand, the Earl was very &s;en&s;ible, that if a Part of his Ships had kept a-&s;tern, that the Superiority might have appear'd on the <HI>French</HI> Side; or rather if they had bore away in the Night towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and fallen to the Ea&s;t|ward of <HI>Barcelona</HI> the next Day, a Battle had been inevitable, and a Victory equally certain; &s;ince the Enemy by this Means had been tempted into an Engagement, and their Retreat being cut off, and their whole Fleet &s;urrounded with almo&s;t double their Num|ber, there had hardly been left for any of them a Probability of E&s;caping.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, when the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> put to Sea again the &s;econd Evening, fearful of loo&s;ing &s;uch a glorious Opportu|nity, and impatient to be aboard to give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, he order'd his Rowers to obtain the &s;ame Station, in order to di&s;cover the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet. And according to his Wi&s;hes he did fall in with it; but unfor|tunately

the Night was &s;o far advanc'd, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him then to put his Project into practice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of <HI>Pe|terborow</HI> arrives on board the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet.</NOTE> Captain <HI>Price,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Wales,</HI> who commanded a Third Rate, was the Per&s;on he fir&s;t came aboard of; but how amaz'd was he to find, in an open Boat at open Sea, the Per&s;on who had Commi&s;&s;ion to command the Fleet? So &s;oon as he was enter'd the Ship, the Earl &s;ent the Ship's Pinnace with Letters to Admiral <HI>Leake,</HI> to acquaint him with his Orders and Intentions; and to Brigadier <HI>Stanhope</HI> with a Notification of his &s;afe Ar|rival; but the Darkne&s;s of the Night prov'd &s;o great an Ob&s;tacle, that it was a long time before the Pinnace could reach the Ad|miral. When Day appear'd, it was a&s;to|ni&s;hing to the whole Fleet to &s;ee the <HI>Union</HI> Flag waving at the Main-top-ma&s;t Head.

<P>WHEN we were about &s;ix Leagues Di|&s;tance from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Port we aim'd at, one of the <HI>French</HI> Scouts gave the Alarm, who making the Signal to another, he communicated it to a Third, and &s;o on, as we afterward &s;orrowfully found, and as the Earl had before apprehended: The <HI>French</HI> Admiral being thus made acquainted with the Force of our Fleet, hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and
<PB N="149" REF="156">
made the be&s;t of his Way from us, either pur&s;uant to Orders, or under the plau&s;ible Excu&s;e of a Retreat.</P>
<P>THIS favourable Opportunity thus lo&s;t, there remain'd nothing to do but to land the Troops with all Expedition; which was executed accordingly: The Regiments, which the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> embark'd the Night before, being the fir&s;t that got into the Town. Let the Reader imagine how plea&s;ing &s;uch a Sight mu&s;t be to tho&s;e in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> reduc'd as they were to the la&s;t Extremity. In this Condition, to &s;ee an Enemy's Fleet give way to another with Reinforcements from <HI>England,</HI> the Sea at the &s;ame In&s;tant cover'd with little Ve&s;&s;els crouded with greater Succours; what was there wanting to compleat the glorious Scene, but what the General had project|ed, a Fight at Sea, under the very Walls of the inve&s;ted City, and the Ships of the Enemy &s;inking, or tow'd in by the victo|rious <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> But Night, and a few Hours, defeated the latter Part of that well intended Landskip.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Philip,</HI> and the Mare&s;chal of <HI>France,</HI> had not fail'd to pu&s;h on the Siege with all imaginable Vigour; but this Re|treat of the Count <HI>de Tholou&s;e,</HI> and the News of tho&s;e Reinforcements, &s;oon chang'd the Scene. Their Courage without was abated proportionably, as theirs within was

elated. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Barce|lona</HI> rais'd</NOTE>In the&s;e Circum&s;tances, a Council of War being call'd, it was unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olv'd to rai&s;e the Siege. Accordingly, next Morning, the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> 1706. while the Sun was under a total Eclyp&s;e, in a &s;uitable Hurry and Confu&s;ion, they broke up, leaving behind them mo&s;t of their Cannon and Mortars, together with va&s;t Quantities of all Sorts of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, &s;carce &s;topping to look back till they had left all but the very Verge of the di&s;puted Dominion behind them.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> look'd with new Plea&s;ure upon this lucky Effort of his old Deli|verers. Captivity is a State no way de|&s;irable to Per&s;ons however brave, of the mo&s;t private Station in Life; but for a King, within two Days of falling into the Hands of his Rival, to receive &s;o &s;ea&s;onable and unexpected a Deliverance, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, as it really did, to open a Scene to univer&s;al Rejoicing among us, too high for any Words to expre&s;s, or any Thoughts to ima|gine, to tho&s;e that were not pre&s;ent and Partakers of it. He forth with gave Orders for a Medal to be &s;truck &s;uitable to the Oc|ca&s;ion; one of which, &s;et round with Dia|monds, he pre&s;ented to Sir <HI>John Leake,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral. The next Orders were for re-ca&s;ting all the damag'd bra&s;s Cannon which the Enemy had left; upon every one of which was, by order, a Sun eclyps'd,
<PB N="151" REF="158">
with this Motto under it: <HI>Magna parvis ob&s;curantur.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE often wonder'd that I never heard any Body curious enough to enquire what could be the Motives to the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s quitting his Dominions upon the rai&s;ing of this Siege; very certain it is that he had a fine Army, under the Command of a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France,</HI> not very con&s;i|derably decreas'd, either by Action or De|&s;ertion: But all this would rather increa&s;e the Curio&s;ity than abate it. In my Opinion then, though Men might have Curio&s;ity enough, the Que&s;tion was purpo&s;ely evaded, under an Apprehen&s;ion that an hone&s;t An&s;wer mu&s;t inevitably give a higher Idea of the General than their Inclinations led them to. At fir&s;t View this may carry the Face of a Paradox; yet if the Reader will con&s;ider, that in every Age Virtue has had its Shaders or Maligners, he will him&s;elf ea&s;ily &s;olve it, at the &s;ame time that he finds him&s;elf compell'd to allow, that tho&s;e, who found them&s;elves unable to prevent his great Services, were willing, in a more &s;ubtil Manner, to endeavour at the annulling of them by Silence and Concealment.</P>
<P>THIS will appear more than bare Suppo|&s;ition, if we compare the pre&s;ent Situation, as to Strength, of the two contending Powers: The <HI>French,</HI> at the Birth of the Siege, con|&s;i&s;ted of five thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons,
<PB N="152" REF="159">
and twenty-five thou&s;and Foot, effective Men. Now grant, that their kill'd and wounded, together with their Sick in the Ho&s;pitals, might amount to five Thou&s;and; yet as their Body of Hor&s;e was entire, and in the be&s;t Condition, the Remaining will appear to be an Army of twenty-five Thou|&s;and at lea&s;t. On the other Side, all the Forces in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> even with their Re|inforcements, amounted to no more than &s;even thou&s;and Foot and four hundred Hor&s;e. Why then, when they rais'd their Siege, did not they march back into the Heart of <HI>Spain,</HI> with their &s;o much &s;uperior Army? or, at lea&s;t, towards their Capital? The An&s;wer can be this, and this only; Be|cau&s;e the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> had taken &s;uch provident Care to render all &s;ecure, that it was thereby render'd next to an Im|po&s;&s;ibility for them &s;o to do. That Gene|ral was &s;atisfy'd, that the Capital of <HI>Cata|lonia</HI> mu&s;t, in cour&s;e, fall into the Hands of the Enemy, unle&s;s a &s;uperior Fleet re|mov'd the Count <HI>de Tholou&s;e,</HI> and threw in timely Succours into the Town: And as that could not depend upon him, but others, he made it his chief Care and a&s;&s;iduous Employment to provide again&s;t tho&s;e Strokes of Fortune to which he found him|&s;elf again likely to be expos'd, as he often had been; and therefore had he Re&s;ource to that Vigilance and Precaution which had
<PB N="153" REF="160">
often retriev'd him, when to others his Cir|cum&s;tances &s;eem'd to be mo&s;t de&s;perate.</P>
<P>THE Generality of Mankind, and the <HI>French</HI> in particular, were of opinion that the taking <HI>Barcelona</HI> would prove a deci&s;ive Stroke, and put a Period to the War in <HI>Spain</HI>; and yet at that very In&s;tant I was inclin'd to believe, that the General flatter'd him&s;elf it would be in his Power to give the Enemy &s;ufficient Mortification, even though the Town &s;hould be oblig'd to &s;ubmit to King <HI>Philip.</HI> The wi&s;e Mea&s;ures taken induc'd me &s;o to believe, and the Sequel approv'd it; for the Earl had &s;o well ex|pended his Caution, that the Enemy, on the Di&s;appointment, found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of quitting <HI>Spain;</HI> and the &s;ame would have put him under equal Difficul|ties had he carry'd the Place. The <HI>French</HI> could never have undertaken that Siege without depending on their Fleet, for their Artillery, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions; &s;ince they mu&s;t be inevitably forc'd to leave behind them the &s;trong Towns of <HI>Torto&s;a, Lerida,</HI> and <HI>Taragona.</HI> The Earl, there|fore, who&s;e perpetual Difficulties &s;eem'd rather to render him more &s;prightly and vi|gorous, took care him&s;elf to examine the whole Country between the <HI>Ebro</HI> and <HI>Barcelona</HI>; and, upon his doing &s;o, was plea&s;ingly, as well as &s;en&s;ibly &s;atisfy'd, that it was practicable to render their Return into
<PB N="154" REF="161">
the Heart of <HI>Spain</HI> impo&s;&s;ible, whether they did or did not &s;ucceed in the Siege they were &s;o intent to undertake.</P>
<P>THERE were but three Ways they could attempt it: The fir&s;t of which was by the Sea-&s;ide, from <HI>Taragona</HI> towards <HI>Torto&s;a</HI>; the mo&s;t barren, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t improper Country in the Univer&s;e to &s;u&s;tain an Army; and yet to the natural, the Earl had added &s;uch artificial Difficulties, as ren|der'd it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for an Army to &s;ub&s;i&s;t or march that Way.</P>
<P>THE middle Way lay through a better Country indeed, yet only practicable by the Care which had been taken to make the Road &s;o. And even here there was a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of marching along the Side of a Mountain, where, by va&s;t Labour and In|du&s;try, a high Way had been cut for two Miles at lea&s;t out of the main Rock. The Earl therefore, by &s;omewhat of the &s;ame Labour, &s;oon made it impa&s;&s;able. He em|ploy'd to that End many Thou&s;ands of the Country People, under a few of his own Officers and Troops, who cutting up twenty &s;everal Places, made &s;o many Precipices, perpendicular almo&s;t as a Wall, which ren|der'd it neither &s;afe, or even to be attempt|ed by any &s;ingle Man in his Wits, much le&s;s by an Army. Be&s;ides, a very few Men, from the higher Cliffs of the Mountain, might have de&s;troy'd an Army with the Arms of
<PB N="155" REF="162">
Nature only, by rolling down large Stones and Pieces of the Rock upon the Enemy pa&s;&s;ing below.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t and uppermo&s;t Way, lay thro' the hilly Part of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and led to <HI>Le|rida,</HI> towards the Head of the <HI>Ebro,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Place we had in all <HI>Spain,</HI> and which was as well furni&s;h'd with a very good Garri&s;on. Along this Road there lay many old Ca&s;tles and little Towns in the Mountains, naturally &s;trong; all which would not only have afforded Oppo&s;ition, but at the &s;ame time have entertain'd an E|nemy with variety of Difficulties; and e&s;pe|cially as the Earl had given Orders and taken Care that all Cattle, and every Thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain an Army, &s;hould be con|vey'd into Places of Security, either in the Mountains or thereabouts. The&s;e three Ways thus precautiou&s;ly &s;ecur'd, what had the Earl to apprehend but the Safety of the Arch-Duke; which yet was through no Default of his, if in any Danger from the Siege?</P>
<P>FOR I well remember, on Receipt of an Expre&s;s from the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> (as he fre|quenly &s;ent &s;uch to enquire after the Pro|ceedings in <HI>Spain</HI>) I was &s;hew'd a Letter, wrote about this time by the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> to that Prince, which rais'd my Spi|rits, though then at a very low Ebb. It was too remarkable to be forgot; and the
<PB N="156" REF="163">
Sub&s;tance of it was, That his Highne&s;s might depend upon it, that he (the Earl) was in much better Circum&s;tances than he was thought to be: That the <HI>French</HI> Officers, knowing nothing of the Situation of the Country, would find them&s;elves ex|treamly di&s;appointed, &s;ince in ca&s;e the Siege was rais'd, their Army &s;hould be oblig'd to abandon <HI>Spain:</HI> Or in ca&s;e the Town was taken, they &s;hould find them&s;elves &s;hut up in that Corner of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and under an Impo&s;&s;ibility of forcing their Way back, either through <HI>Aragon</HI> or <HI>Valencia:</HI> That by this Means all <HI>Spain,</HI> to the <HI>Ebro,</HI> would be open to the Lord <HI>Galoway,</HI> who might march to <HI>Madrid,</HI> or any where el&s;e, without Oppo&s;ition. That he had no other Unea&s;ine&s;s or Concern upon him, but for the Per&s;on of the Arch-Duke, whom he had neverthele&s;s earne&s;tly &s;olicited not to re|main in the Town on the very fir&s;t Ap|pearance of the intended Siege.</P>
<P><HI>BARCELONA</HI> being thus reliev'd, and King <HI>Philip</HI> forc'd out of <HI>Spain,</HI> by the&s;e cautious Steps taken by the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow,</HI> before we bring him to <HI>Valencia,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to intimate, that as it always was the Cu&s;tom of that General to &s;ettle, by a Council of War, all the Mea|&s;ures to be taken, whenever he was oblig'd for the Service to leave the Arch-Duke; a Council of War was now accordingly held,
<PB N="157" REF="164">
where all the General Officers, and tho&s;e in greate&s;t Employments at Court a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Here every thing was in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner concerted and re&s;olv'd upon; here Garri&s;ons were &s;ettled for all the &s;trong Places, and Governors appointed: But the main Article then agreed upon was, that King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hould immediately begin his Journey to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that by the Way of <HI>Valencia.</HI> The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd for it was, becau&s;e that Kingdom being in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, no Difficulties could ari&s;e which might occa&s;ion Delay, if his Maje&s;ty took that Rout. It was likewi&s;e agreed in the &s;ame Council, that the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> &s;hould embark all the Foot, not in Gar|ri&s;ons, for their more &s;peedy, as well as more ea&s;y Conveyance to <HI>Valencia.</HI> The &s;ame Council of War agreed, that all the Hor&s;e in that Kingdom &s;hould be drawn to|gether, the better to in&s;ure the Mea&s;ures to be taken for the opening and facilitating his Maje&s;ty's Progre&s;s to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, after the&s;e Re&s;olutions were taken, the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> embarks his Forces and &s;ails for <HI>Valencia,</HI> where he was doubly welcom'd by all Sorts of People upon Account of his &s;afe Arrival, and the News he brought along with it. By the Joy they expre&s;s'd, one would have ima|gin'd that the General had e&s;cap'd the &s;ame Danger with the King; and, in truth, had

their King arriv'd with him in Per&s;on, the mo&s;t loyal and zealous would have found them&s;elves at a lo&s;s how to have expre&s;s'd their Satisfaction in a more &s;en&s;ible Manner.</P>
<P>SOON after his Landing, with his cu&s;to|mary Vivacity, he apply'd him&s;elf to put in execution the Re&s;olutions taken in the Coun|cils of War at <HI>Barcelona</HI>; and a little to improve upon them, he rais'd an intire Re|giment of Dragoons, bought them Hor&s;es, provided them Cloaths, Arms, and Acou|trements; and in &s;ix Weeks time had them ready to take the Field; a thing though hardly to be parallell'd, is yet &s;carce worthy to be mentioned among &s;o many nobler Actions of his; yet in regard to another General it may merit Notice, &s;ince while he had <HI>Madrid</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion near four Months, he neither augmented his Troops, nor lay'd up any Magazines; neither &s;ent he all that time any one Expre&s;s to concert any Mea|&s;ures with the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI>; but lay under a perfect Inactivity, or which was wor&s;e, negotiating that unfortunate Project of carrying King <HI>Charles</HI> to <HI>Madrid</HI> by the round-about and ill-concerted Way of <HI>Ara|gon</HI>; a Project not only contrary to the &s;olemn Re&s;olutions of the Council of War; but which in reality was the Root of all our &s;ucceeding Misfortunes; and that only for the wretched Vanity of appearing to have had &s;ome Share in bringing the King to his
<PB N="159" REF="166">
Capital; but how minute a Share it was will be manife&s;t, if it be con&s;ider'd that another General had fir&s;t made the Way ea&s;y, by driving the Enemy out of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> General only &s;tay'd at <HI>Madrid</HI> till the Return of tho&s;e Troops which were in a manner driven out of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet that Tran&s;action, doughty as it was, took up four mo&s;t precious Months, which mo&s;t certainly might have been much better employ'd in rendering it impo&s;&s;ible for the Enemy to re-enter <HI>Spain;</HI> nor had there been any great Difficulty in &s;o doing, but the contrary, if the General at <HI>Madrid</HI> had thought convenient to have join'd the Troops under the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> and then to have march'd directly towards <HI>Pampelona,</HI> or the Frontiers of <HI>France.</HI> To this the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> &s;olicited the King, and tho&s;e about him; he advis'd, de&s;ir'd, and intreated him to lo&s;e no time, but to put in Execution tho&s;e Mea&s;ures re|&s;olv'd on at <HI>Barcelona.</HI> A Council of War in <HI>Valencia</HI> renew'd the &s;ame Application: but all to no Purpo&s;e, his Rout was order'd him, and that to meet his Maje&s;ty on the Frontiers of <HI>Arragon.</HI> There, indeed, the Earl did meet the King; and the <HI>French</HI> General an Army, which, by Virtue of a decrepid Intelligence, he never &s;aw or heard of till he fled from it to his Camp
<PB N="160" REF="167">
at <HI>Guadalira.</HI> Inexpre&s;&s;ible was the Con|fu&s;ion in this fatal Camp: The King from <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> from <HI>Valencia</HI> arriving in it the &s;ame Day, al|mo&s;t the &s;ame Hour that the Earl of <HI>Galo|way</HI> enter'd under a ha&s;ty Retreat before the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>BUT to return to Order, which a Zeal of Ju&s;tice has made me &s;omewhat anticipate; the Earl had not been long at <HI>Valencia</HI> be|fore he gave Orders to Major-General <HI>Windham</HI> to march with all the Forces he had, which were not above two thou&s;and Men, and lay Siege to <HI>Requina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Requina</HI> be&s;ieg'd.</NOTE> a Town ten Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Valencia,</HI> and in the Way to <HI>Madrid.</HI> The Town was not very &s;trong, nor very large; but &s;ure the odlie&s;t fortify'd that ever was. The Hou&s;es in a Circle connectively compos'd the Wall; and the People, who defended the Town, in&s;tead of firing from Hornworks, Counter-&s;carps, and Ba&s;tions, fir'd out of the Win|dows of their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all which, General <HI>Windam</HI> found much greater Oppo&s;ition than he at fir&s;t imagin'd; and therefore finding he &s;hould want Ammunition, he &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> for a Supply; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;igning, as a Rea&s;on for it, the unexpected Ob&s;tinacy of the Town. So &s;oon as the Earl receiv'd the Letter he &s;ent for me; and told me I mu&s;t repair to <HI>Re|quina,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="168">
where they would want an Engi|neer; and that I mu&s;t be ready next Morn|ing, when he &s;hould order a Lieutenant, with thirty Soldiers and two Matro&s;&s;es, to guard &s;ome Powder for that Service.

<P>WE had reach'd Saint <HI>Jago,</HI> a &s;mall Village about midway between <HI>Valencia</HI> and <HI>Requina,</HI> when the Officer, ju&s;t as he was got without the Town, re&s;olving to take up his Quarters on the Spot, order'd the Mules to be unloaded. The Powder, which con&s;i&s;ted of forty-five Barrels, was pil'd up in a Circle, and cover'd with Oil-cloth, to pre&s;erve it from the Weather; and though we had agreed to &s;up together at my Quarters within the Village, yet being weary and fatigu'd, he order'd his Field-Bed to be put up near the Powder, and &s;o lay down to take a &s;hort Nap. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Forty-five Barrels of Powder blewn up by an Accident.</NOTE>I had &s;carce been at my Quarters an Hour, when a &s;ud|den Shock attack'd the Hou&s;e &s;o violently, that it threw down Tiles, Windows, Chim|neys and all. It pre&s;ently came into my Head what was the Occa&s;ion; and as my Fears &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o it prov'd: For running to the Door I &s;aw a Cloud a&s;cending from the Spot I left the Powder pitch'd upon. In ha&s;te making up to which, nothing was to
<PB N="162" REF="169">
be &s;een but the bare Circle upon which it had &s;tood. The Bed was blown quite away, and the poor Lieutenant all to pieces, &s;eve|ral of his Limbs being found &s;eparate, and at a va&s;t Di&s;tance each from the other; and particularly an Arm, with a Ring on one of the Fingers. The Matro&s;&s;es were, if po&s;&s;ible, in a yet wor&s;e Condition, that is, as to Manglement and Laceration. All the Soldiers who were &s;tanding, and any thing near, were &s;truck dead. Only &s;uch as lay &s;leeping on the Ground e&s;cap'd; and of tho&s;e one a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the Bla&s;t remov'd him &s;everal Foot from his Place of Repo&s;e. In &s;hort, enquiring into this deplorable Di&s;a&s;ter, I had this Account: That a Pig running out of the Town, the Soldiers endeavour'd to intercept its Return; but driving it upon the Matro&s;&s;es, one of them, who was jealous of its getting back into the Hands of the Soldiers, drew his Pi&s;tol to &s;hoot it, which was the Source of this mi&s;erable Cata&s;trophe. The Lieutenant car|ry'd along with him a Bag of Dollars to pay the Soldiers Quarters, of which the People, and the Soldiers that were &s;av'd, found many; but blown to an inconceivable Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>WITH tho&s;e few Soldiers that remain'd alive, I proceeded, according to my Orders, to <HI>Requina</HI>; where, when I arriv'd, I gave General <HI>Windham</HI> an Account of the

Di&s;a&s;ter at St. <HI>Jago.</HI> As &s;uch it troubled him, and not a little on account of the Di&s;|appointment. However, to make the be&s;t of a bad Market, he gave Orders for the forming of a Mine under an old Ca&s;tle, which was part of the Wall. As it was or|der'd, &s;o it was begun, more <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> than with any Expectation of Succe&s;s from it as a Mine. Neverthele&s;s, I had &s;carce began to frame the Oven of the Mine, when tho&s;e within the Town de&s;ir'd to capitulate.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Requina</HI> &s;urrenders.</NOTE> This being all we could aim at, under the Mi&s;carriage of our Powder at St. <HI>Jago</HI> (none being yet arriv'd to &s;upply that De|fect) Articles were readily granted them; pur&s;uant to which, that Part of the Garri&s;on, which was compos'd of <HI>Ca&s;tilian</HI> Gentry, had Liberty to go wherever they thought be&s;t, and the re&s;t were made Pri&s;oners of War. <HI>Requina</HI> being thus reduc'd to the Obedience of <HI>Charles</HI> III. a new rais'd Regi|ment of <HI>Spaniards</HI> was left in Garri&s;on, the Colonel of which was appointed Governor; and our Supply of Powder having at la&s;t got &s;afe to us, General <HI>Windham</HI> march'd his little Army to <HI>Cuenca.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cuenca</HI> be&s;ieg'd.</NOTE><HI>CUENCA</HI> is a con&s;iderable City and a Bi&s;hoprick; therefore to pretend to &s;it down before it with &s;uch a Company of Forragers, rather than an Army, mu&s;t be plac'd among the hardy Influences of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI>'s au&s;picious Admini&s;tra|tion.
<PB N="164" REF="171">
On the out Part of <HI>Cuenca</HI> there &s;tood an old Ca&s;tle, from which, upon our Ap|proach, they play'd upon us furiou&s;ly: But as &s;oon as we could bring two Pieces of our Cannon to bear, we an&s;wer'd their Fire with &s;o good Succe&s;s, that we &s;oon oblig'd them to retire into the Town. We had rais'd a Battery of twelve Guns again&s;t the City, on their Rejection of the Summons &s;ent them to come under the Obedience of King <HI>Charles</HI>; going to which from the old Ca&s;tle la&s;t reduc'd, I receiv'd a Shot on the Toe of one of my Shoes, which carry'd that Part of the Shoe intirely away, without any further Damage.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to that Battery we ply'd them warmly (as well as from three Mor|tars) for the Space of three Days, their Nights included; but ob&s;erving, that in one particular Hou&s;e, they were remarkably bu&s;y; People thronging in and out below; and tho&s;e above firing perpetually out of the Windows, I was re&s;olv'd to have one Shot at that Window, and made tho&s;e Officers about me take Notice of it. True it was, the Di&s;tance would hardly allow me to hope for Succe&s;s; yet as the Experiment could only be attended with the Expence of a &s;ingle Ball, I made it. So &s;oon as the Smoak of my own Cannon would permit it, we could &s;ee Clouds of Du&s;t i&s;&s;uing from out of the Window, which, together with
<PB N="165" REF="172">
the People's crouding out of Doors, con|vinc'd the Officers, whom I had de&s;ir'd to take Notice of it, that I had been no bad Mark&s;man.</P>
<P>UPON this, two Prie&s;ts were &s;ent out of the Place with Propo&s;als; but they were &s;o triflingly extravagant, that as &s;oon as ever the General heard them, he order'd their An&s;wer in a fre&s;h Renewal of the Fire of both Cannon and Mortars. And it hap|pen'd to be with &s;o much Havock and Exe|cution, that they were &s;oon taught Rea&s;on; and &s;ent back their Divines, with much more moderate Demands. After the Ge|neral had a little modell'd the&s;e la&s;t, they were accepted; and according to the Ar|ticles of Capitulation, the City was that very Day &s;urrender'd into our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cuenca</HI> &s;urrenders.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Duncannon</HI>'s Regiment took Guard of all the Gates; and King <HI>Charles</HI> was proclaim'd in due Form.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> during this Expedition, had left <HI>Valencia,</HI> and was ar|riv'd at my Lord <HI>Galway</HI>'s Camp at <HI>Gua|dalaxara</HI>; who for the Confederates, and King <HI>Charles</HI> in particular, unfortunately was order'd from <HI>Portugal,</HI> to take the Command from a General, who had all along been almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly &s;ucce&s;sful, and by his own great Actions pav'd the Way for a &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age to that his Sup|planter.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173">YET even in this fatal Place the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> made &s;ome Propo&s;als, which, had they beem embrac'd, might, in all Probability, have &s;ecur'd <HI>Madrid</HI> from fall|ing into the Hands of the Enemy: But, in oppo&s;ition thereto, the Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> and all his <HI>Portugueze</HI> Officers, were for forcing the next Day the Enemy to Battle. The almo&s;t only Per&s;on again&s;t it was the Earl of <HI>Peterborow;</HI> who then and there took the Liberty to evince the Impo&s;&s;ibility of com|ing to an Engagement. This the next Morning too evidently made apparent, when upon the fir&s;t Motion of our Troops towards the River, which they pretended to pa&s;s, and mu&s;t pa&s;s, before they could engage, they were &s;o warmly &s;aluted from the Bat|teries of the Enemy, and their &s;mall Shot, that our Regiments were forc'd to retire in Confu&s;ion to their Camp. By which Re|buff all heroical Imaginations were at pre|&s;ent laid a&s;ide, to con&s;ider how they might make their Retreat to <HI>Valencia.</HI></P>
<P>THE Retreat being at la&s;t re&s;olv'd on, and a Multiplicity of Generals rendering our bad Circum&s;tances much wor&s;e, the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> met with a fortunate Reprieve, by Solicitations from the Queen, and De&s;ires tantamount to Orders, that he would go with the Troops left in <HI>Catalonia</HI> to the Relief of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> It is hardly to be doubted that that General was
<PB N="167" REF="174">
glad to withdraw from tho&s;e Scenes of Con|fu&s;ion, which were but too vi&s;ible to Eyes even le&s;s di&s;cerning than his. However, he forbore to prepare him&s;elf to put her Ma|je&s;ty's De&s;ires in execution, as they were not peremptory, till it had been re&s;olv'd by the unanimous Con&s;ent of a Council of War, where the King, all the Generals and Mi|ni&s;ters were pre&s;ent, That it was expedient for the Service that the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> during the Winter Sea&s;on, &s;hould comply with her Maje&s;ty's De&s;ires, and go for <HI>Italy</HI>; &s;ince he might return before the opening of the Campaign, if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. And return indeed he did, before the Cam|paign open'd, and brought along with him one hundred thou&s;and Pounds from <HI>Genoa,</HI> to the great Comfort and Support of our Troops, which had neither Money nor Credit. But on his Return, that noble Earl found the Lord <HI>Galway</HI> had been near as &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t him, as he had been un&s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Enemy. Thence was the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> recall'd to make room for an unfortunate General, who the next Year &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be decoy'd in|to that fatal Battle of <HI>Almanza.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> on his leaving <HI>Valencia,</HI> had order'd his Baggage to fol|low him to the Camp at <HI>Guadalaxara</HI>; and it arriv'd in our little Camp, &s;o far &s;afe in its way to the greater at <HI>Guadalaxara.</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="175">
I think it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even loaded Wag|gons; and General <HI>Windham</HI> gave Orders for a &s;mall Guard to e&s;corte it; under which they proceeded on their Journey: But a|bout eight Leagues from <HI>Cuenca,</HI> at a pretty Town call'd <HI>Huette,</HI> a Party from the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI>'s Army, with Boughs in their Hats, the better to appear what they were not (for the Bough in the Hat is the Badge of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as white Paper is the Badge of the <HI>French</HI>) came into the Town, crying all the way, <HI>Viva Carlos Tercero, Viva.</HI> With the&s;e Acclamations in their Mouths, they advanc'd up to the very Waggons; when attacking the Guards, who had too much deluded them&s;elves with Appearances, they routed 'em, and immediately plunder'd the Waggons of all that was valuable, and then march'd off.</P>
<P>THE Noi&s;e of this &s;oon reach'd the Ears of the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> at <HI>Guadalaxara.</HI> When leaving my Lord <HI>Galway</HI>'s Camp, pur&s;uant to the Re&s;olutions of the Council of War, with a Party only of four&s;core of <HI>Killegrew</HI>'s Dragoons, he met General <HI>Windham</HI>'s little Army within a League of <HI>Huette,</HI> the Place where his Baggage had been plunder'd. The Earl had &s;trong Mo|tives of Su&s;picion, that the Inhabitants had given Intelligence to the Enemy; and, as is very natural, giving way to the fir&s;t Dictates of Re&s;entment, he re&s;olv'd to have
<PB N="169" REF="176">
lay'd the Town in A&s;hes: But when he came near it, the Clergy and Magi&s;trates upon their Knees, di&s;avowing the Charge, and a&s;&s;erting their Innocence, prevail'd on the good Nature of that generous Earl, without any great Difficulty, to &s;pare the Town, at lea&s;t not to burn it.</P>
<P>WE march'd however into the Town, and that Night took up our Quarters there; and the Magi&s;trates, under the Dread of our avenging our &s;elves, on their part took Care that we were well &s;upplied. But when they were made &s;en&s;ible of the Value of the Lo&s;s, which the Earl had &s;u&s;tain'd; and that on a moderate Computation it amount|ed to at lea&s;t eight thou&s;and Pi&s;toles; they voluntarily pre&s;ented them&s;elves next Morn|ing, and of their own accord offer'd to make his Lord&s;hip full Satisfaction, and that, in their own Phra&s;e, <HI>de Contado, in ready Money.</HI> The Earl was not di&s;pleas'd at their Offer; but generou&s;ly made An|&s;wer, That he was ju&s;t come from my Lord <HI>Galway</HI>'s Camp at <HI>Chincon,</HI> where he found they were in a likelihood of wanting Bread; and as he imagin'd it might be ea&s;ier to them to rai&s;e the Value in Corn, than in ready Money; if they would &s;end to that Value in Corn to the Lord <HI>Galway</HI>'s Camp, he would be &s;atisfy'd. This they with Joy embrac'd, and immediately com|plied with.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177">I AM apt to think the la&s;t Century (and I very much fear the Current will be as de|ficient) can hardly produce a parallel In|&s;tance of Genero&s;ity and true publick Spi|ritedne&s;s: And the World will be of my Opinion, when I have corroborated this with another Pa&s;&s;age &s;ome Years after. The Commi&s;&s;ioners for Stating the Debts due to the Army, meeting daily for that Purpo&s;e at their Hou&s;e in <HI>Darby</HI> Court in <HI>Channel Row,</HI> I there mentioned to Mr. <HI>Read,</HI> Gentleman to his Lord&s;hip, this very ju&s;t and honourable Claim upon the Government, as Monies advanced for the U&s;e of the Army. Who told me in a little Time after, that he had mention'd it to his Lord&s;hip; but with no other Effect than to have it rejected with a generous Di&s;dain.</P>
<P>WHILE we &s;tay'd at <HI>Huette</HI> there was a little Incident in Life, which gave me great Diver&s;ion. The Earl, who had al|ways maintain'd a good Corre&s;pondence with the fair Sex, hearing from one of the Prie&s;ts of the Place, That on the Alarm of burning the Town, one of the fine&s;t Ladies in all <HI>Spain</HI> had taken Refuge in the Nunnery, was de&s;irous to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P>THE Nunnery &s;tood upon a &s;mall ri&s;ing Hill within the Town; and to obtain the View, the Earl had pre&s;ently in his Head this Stratagem; he &s;ends for me, as Engi|neer,
<PB N="171" REF="178">
to have my Advice, how to rai&s;e a proper Fortification upon that Hill out of the Nunnery. I waited upon his Lord&s;hip to the Place, where declaring the Intent of our coming, and giving plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons for it, the Train took, and immediately the Lady Abbe&s;s, and the fair Lady, came out to make Interce&s;&s;ion, That his Lord|&s;hip would be pleas'd to lay a&s;ide that De|&s;ign. The divine Oratory of one, and the beautiful Charms of the other, prevail'd; &s;o his Lord&s;hip left the Fortification to be the Work of &s;ome future Generation.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Huette</HI> the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> march'd forwards for <HI>Valencia,</HI> with only tho&s;e four&s;core Dragoons, which came with him from <HI>Chincon,</HI> leaving General <HI>Wind|ham</HI> pur&s;uing his own Orders to join his Forces to the Army then under the Com|mand of the Lord <HI>Galway.</HI> But &s;topping at <HI>Campilio,</HI> a little Town in our Way, his Lord&s;hip had Information of a mo&s;t bar|barous Fact committed that very Morning by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at a &s;mall <HI>Villa,</HI> about a League di&s;tant, upon &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sol|diers.</P>
<P>A CAPTAIN of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guards (who&s;e Name has &s;lip'd my Memory, tho' I well knew the Man) marching in order to join the Battalion of the Guards, then under the Command of General <HI>Windham,</HI> with &s;ome of his Soldiers, that had been in
<PB N="172" REF="179">
the Ho&s;pital, took up his Quarters in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> little <HI>Villa.</HI> But on his marching out of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> next Morning, a Shot in the Back lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Officer dead upon the Spot: And as it had been before concerted, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the Place at the &s;ame Time fell upon the poor, weak Soldiers, killing &s;everal; not even &s;paring their Wives. This was but a Prelude to their Barbarity; their &s;avage Cruelty was only whetted, not glutted. They took the &s;urviving few; hurried and dragg'd them up a Hill, a little without the <HI>Villa.</HI> On the Top of this Hill there was a Hole, or Opening, &s;omewhat like the Mouth of one of our Coal-Pits, down this they ca&s;t &s;everal, who, with hideous Shrieks and Cries, made more hideous by the Ecchoes of the Cha&s;m, there lo&s;t their Lives.</P>
<P>THIS Relation was thus made to the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> at his Quarters at <HI>Campilio</HI>; who immediately gave Orders for to found to Hor&s;e. At fir&s;t we were all &s;urpriz'd; but were &s;oon &s;atisfy'd, that it was to revenge, or rather, do Ju&s;tice, on this barbarous Action.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as we enter'd the <HI>Villa</HI> we found that mo&s;t of the Inhabitants, but e&s;pecially the mo&s;t Guilty, had withdrawn them&s;elves on our Approach. We found, however, many of the dead Soldiers Cloaths, which had been convey'd into the
<PB N="173" REF="180">
Church, and there hid. And a &s;trong Ac|cu&s;ation being laid again&s;t a Per&s;on belong|ing to the Church, and full Proof made, that he had been &s;ingularly Indu&s;trious in the Execution of that horrid Piece of Bar|barity on the Hill, his Lord&s;hip command|ed him to be hang'd up at the Knocker of the Door.</P>
<P>AFTER this piece of military Ju&s;tice, we were led up to the fatal Pit or Hole, down which many had been ca&s;t headlong. There we found one poor Soldier alive, who, upon his throwing in, had catch'd fa&s;t hold of &s;ome impending Bu&s;hes, and &s;av'd him&s;elf on a little Jutty within the Concavity. On hearing us talk <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> he cry'd out; and Ropes being let down, in a little Time he was drawn up; when he gave us an ample Detail of the whole Villany. Among other Particulars, I remember he told me of a very narrow E&s;cape he had in that ob&s;cure Rece&s;s. A poor Woman, one of the Wives of the Soldiers, who were thrown down after him, &s;truggled, and roared &s;o much, that they could not, with all their Force, throw her cleaverly in the Middle; by which means falling near the Side, in her Fall &s;he almo&s;t beat him from his Place of Security.</P>
<P>UPON the Conclu&s;ion of this tragical. Relation of the Soldier thus &s;aved, his Lord&s;hip gave immediate Orders for the
<PB N="174" REF="181">
Firing of the <HI>Villa,</HI> which was executed with due Severity: After which his Lord|&s;hip march'd back to his Quarters at <HI>Cam|pilio</HI>; from whence, two Days after, we arriv'd at <HI>Valencia.</HI> Where, the fir&s;t Thing pre&s;ented to that noble Lord, was all the Papers taken in the Plunder of his Baggage, which the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> had generou&s;ly order'd to be return'd him, without wa&s;te or opening.</P>
<P>IT was too manife&s;t, after the Earl's ar|rival at this City, that the Alteration in the Command of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces, which before was only receiv'd as a Rumour, had deeper Grounds for Belief, than many of his Friends in that City could have wi&s;h'd. His Lord&s;hip had gain'd the Love of all by a Thou&s;and engaging Conde&s;cen&s;ions; even his Gallantries being no way prejudicial, were not offen&s;ive; and though his Lord|&s;hip did his utmo&s;t to conceal his Chagrin, the Sympathy of tho&s;e around him made &s;uch Di&s;coveries upon him, as would have di&s;appointed a double Portion of his Cauti|on. They had &s;een him un-elated under Succe&s;&s;es, that were &s;o near being unac|countable, that in a Country of le&s;s Super|&s;tition than <HI>Spain,</HI> they might almo&s;t have pa&s;s'd for miraculous; they knew full well, that nothing, but that Series of Succe&s;&s;es had pav'd a Pa&s;&s;age for the General that was to &s;uper&s;ede him; tho&s;e only having
<PB N="175" REF="182">
removed all the Difficulties of his March from <HI>Portugal</HI> to <HI>Madrid</HI>; they knew him the older General; and therefore, not knowing, that in the Court he came from, Intrigue was too often the Soul of Merit, they could not but be amazed at a Change, which his Lord&s;hip was unwilling any body &s;hould perceive by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT was upon this Account, that, as for|merly, he treated the Ladies with Balls, and to pur&s;ue the Dons in their own Humour, order'd a <HI>Tawridore</HI> or <HI>Bull-Fea&s;t.</HI> In <HI>Spain</HI> no &s;ort of publick Diver&s;ions are e&s;teemed equal with this. But the Bulls provided at <HI>Valencia,</HI> not being of the right Breed, nor ever initiated in the My&s;teries, did not acquit them&s;elves at all ma&s;terly; and con&s;equently, did not give the Diver|&s;ion, or Satisfaction expected. For which Rea&s;on I &s;hall omit giving a De&s;cription of this Bull-Fea&s;t; and de&s;ire my Reader to &s;u&s;pend his Curio&s;ity till I come to &s;ome, which, in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sen&s;e, were much more entertaining; that is, attended with much greater Hazards and Danger.</P>
<P>BUT though I have &s;aid, the Gallan|tries of the General were mo&s;tly political, at lea&s;t very inoffen&s;ive; yet there hap|pen'd about this Time, and in this Place, a piece of Gallantry, that gave the Earl a va&s;t deal of Offence and Vexation; as a Matter, that in its Con&s;equences might
<PB N="176" REF="183">
have been fatal to the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles,</HI> if not to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in general; and which I the rather relate, in that it may be of u&s;e to young Officers, and others; pointing out to them the Danger, not to &s;ay Folly, of inadvertent and preci|pitate Engagements, under unruly Pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid before, that <HI>Valencia</HI> is famous for fine Women. It indeed abounds in them; and among tho&s;e, are great Num|bers of Courtezans not inferior in Beauty to any. Neverthele&s;s, two of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, not caring for the common Road, however &s;afe, re&s;olv'd to launch into the deeper Seas, though attended with much greater Danger. Amours, the common Failing of that fair City, was the Occa&s;ion of this Accident, and two Nuns the Objects. It is cu&s;tomary in that Country for young People in an Evening to re&s;ort to the Grates of the Nunneries, there to divert them|&s;elves, and the Nuns, with a little plea&s;ant and inoffen&s;ive Chitchat. For though I have heard &s;ome relate a World of nau&s;eous Pa&s;|&s;ages at &s;uch Conver&s;ations, I mu&s;t declare, that I never &s;aw, or heard any Thing un|&s;eemly; and therefore whenever I have heard any &s;uch from &s;uch Fabuli&s;ts, I never &s;o much wrong'd my Judgment as to afford them Credit.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="184">OUR two Officers were very a&s;&s;iduous at the Grates of a Nunnery in this Place; and having there pitch'd upon two Nuns, pro|&s;ecuted their Amours with &s;uch Vigour, that, in a little time, they had made a very great Progre&s;s in their Affections, without in the lea&s;t con&s;idering the Dangers that mu&s;t attend them&s;elves and the Fair; they had exchang'd Vows, and prevail'd upon the weaker Ve&s;&s;els to endeavour to get out to their Lovers. To effect which, &s;oon after, a Plot was lay'd; the Means, the Hour, and every thing agreed upon.</P>
<P>IT is the Cu&s;tom of that Nunnery, as of many others, for the Nuns to take their weekly Cour&s;es in keeping the Keys of all the Doors. The two Love-&s;ick Ladies giving Notice to their Lovers at the Grate, that one of their Turns was come, the Night and Hour was appointed, which the Officers punctually ob&s;erving, carry'd off their Prey without either Difficulty or In|terruption.</P>
<P>BUT next Morning, when the Nuns were mi&s;&s;ing, what an Uproar was there over all the City? The Ladies were both of Quality; and therefore the Tidings were fir&s;t carry'd to their Relations. They re|ceiv'd the News with Vows of utmo&s;t Ven|geance; and, as is u&s;ual in that Country, put them&s;elves in Arms for that Purpo&s;e. There needed no great canva&s;&s;ing for di&s;|covering
<PB N="178" REF="185">
who were the Aggre&s;&s;ors: The Officers had been too frequent, and too publick, in their Addre&s;&s;es, to leave any room for que&s;tion. Accordingly, they were complain'd of and &s;ought for; but &s;en&s;ible at la&s;t of their pa&s;t Temerity, they endeavour'd, and with a great deal of Difficulty perfected their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>LESS fortunate were the two fair Nuns; their Lovers, in their utmo&s;t Exigence, had for&s;aken them; and they, poor Creatures, knew not where to fly. Under this &s;ad Dilemma they were taken; and, as in like Offences, condemn'd directly to the Puni&s;h|ment of <HI>immuring.</HI> And what greater Puni&s;hment is there on Earth than to be con|fin'd between four narrow Walls, only open at the Top; and thence to be half &s;upported with Bread and Water, till the Offenders gradually &s;tarve to Death?</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> though highly exa&s;perated at the Proceedings of his Offi|cers, in compa&s;&s;ion to the unhappy Fair, re&s;olv'd to interpo&s;e by all the moderate Means po&s;&s;ible. He knew very well, that no one Thing could &s;o much prejudice the <HI>Spaniard</HI> again&s;t him, as the countenancing &s;uch an Action; wherefore he inveigh'd a|gain&s;t the Officers, at the &s;ame time that he endeavour'd to mitigate in favour of the Ladies: But all was in vain; it was urg'd again&s;t tho&s;e charitable Interce&s;&s;ions, that
<PB N="179" REF="186">
they had broke their Vows; and in that had broke in upon the Laws of the Nun|nery and Religion; the Con&s;equence of all which could be nothing le&s;s than the Puni&s;h|ment appointed to be inflicted. And which was the harde&s;t of all, the neare&s;t of their Relations mo&s;t oppos'd all his generous Me|diations; and tho&s;e, who according to the common Cour&s;e of Nature &s;hould have thank'd him for his Endeavours to be in&s;tru|mental in re&s;cuing them from the impending Danger, grew more and more enrag'd, be|cau&s;e he oppos'd them in their De&s;ign of a cruel Revenge.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all which the Earl per&s;ever'd; and after a deal of Labour, fir&s;t got the Penalty &s;u&s;pended; and, &s;oon after, by the Dint of a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money (a mo&s;t powerful Argument, which prevails in every Country) &s;av'd the poor Nuns from immuring; and at la&s;t, though with great Reluctance, he got them receiv'd again into the Nunnery. As to the War|like Lovers, one of them was the Year after &s;lain at the Battle of <HI>Almanza</HI>; the other is yet living, being a Brigadier in the Army.</P>
<P>WHILE the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> was here with his little Army of great Hereticks, neither Prie&s;ts nor People were &s;o open in their &s;uper&s;titious Fopperies, as I at other times found them. For which Rea&s;on I
<PB N="180" REF="187">
will make bold, and by an Antichroni&s;m in this Place, a little anticipate &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations that I made &s;ome time after the Earl left it. And as I have not often committed &s;uch a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, I hope it may be the more excu&s;able now, and no way blemi&s;h my Memoirs, that I break in upon the Series of my Journal.</P>
<P><HI>VALENCIA</HI> is a hand&s;ome City, and a Bi&s;hoprick; and is con&s;iderable not only for the Plea&s;antne&s;s of its Situation and beautiful Ladies; but (which at &s;ome cer|tain Times, and on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, to them is more valuable than both tho&s;e put to|gether) for being the Birth-place of Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> the Patron of the Place; and next for its being the Place where <HI>Santo Domingo,</HI> the fir&s;t In&s;titutor of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Order had his Education. Here, in honour of the la&s;t, is a &s;pacious and very &s;plendid Convent of the <HI>Dominicans.</HI> Walking by which, I one Day ob&s;erv'd over the Gate, a Figure of a Man in Stone; and near it a Dog with a lighted Torch in his Mouth. The Image I rightly enough took to intend that of the Saint; but inquiring of one of the Order, at the Gate, the Meaning of the Figures near it, he very courteou&s;ly ask'd me to walk in, and then entertain'd me with the following Relation:</P>
<P>WHEN the Mother of <HI>Santo Domingo,</HI> &s;aid that Religious, was with Child of that
<PB N="181" REF="188">
future Saint, &s;he had a Dream which very much afflicted her. She dreamt that &s;he heard a Dog bark in her Belly; and in|quiring (at what Oracle is not &s;aid) the Meaning of her Dream, &s;he was told, <HI>That that Child &s;hould bark out the Go&s;pel</HI> (ex|cu&s;e the Barene&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion, it may run better in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>; tho', if I remember right, <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> gives it in <HI>Latin</HI> much the &s;ame Turn) <HI>which &s;hould thence &s;hine out like that lighted Torch.</HI> And this is the Rea&s;on, that wherever you &s;ee the Image of that Saint, a Dog and a lighted Torch is in the Group.</P>
<P>HE told me at the &s;ame time, that there had been more Popes and Cardinals of that Order than of any, if not all the other. To confirm which, he led me into a large Gal|lery, on each Side whereof he &s;hew'd me the Pictures of all the Popes and Cardinals that had been of that Order; among which, I particularly took Notice of that of Cardi|nal <HI>Howard,</HI> great Uncle to the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> But after many <HI>Enco|miums</HI> of their Society, with which he in|ter&s;pers'd his Di&s;cour&s;e, he added one that I lea&s;t valu'd it for; That the &s;ole Care and Conduct of the Inqui&s;ition was intru&s;ted with them.</P>
<P>FINDING me attentive, or not &s;o con|tradictory as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Humour generally is, he next brought me into a fair and large
<PB N="182" REF="189">
Cloi&s;ter, round which I took &s;everal Turns with him; and, indeed, the Place was too delicious to tire, under a Conver&s;ation le&s;s pertinent or courteous than that he enter|tain'd me with. In the Middle of the Cloi&s;ter was a &s;mall but pretty and &s;weet Grove of Orange and Lemon-trees; the&s;e bore Fruit ripe and green, and Flowers, all together on one Tree; and their Fruit was &s;o very large and beautiful, and their Flowers &s;o tran&s;cendently odoriferous, that all I had ever &s;een of the like Kind in <HI>Eng|land</HI> could comparatively pa&s;s only for Beauty in Epitome, or Nature imitated in Wax-work. Many Flocks al&s;o of pretty little Birds, with their chearful Notes, added not a little to my Delight. In &s;hort, in Life I never knew or found three of my Sen&s;es at once &s;o exqui&s;itely gratify'd.</P>
<P>NOT far from this, Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> the Patron, as I &s;aid before, of this City, has a Chapel dedicated to him. Once a Year they do him Honour in a &s;umptuous Pro|ce&s;&s;ion. Then are their Streets all &s;trow'd with Flowers, and their Hou&s;es &s;et off with their riche&s;t Tape&s;tries; every one &s;trives to excel his Neighbour in di&s;tingui&s;hing him|&s;elf by the Honour he pays to that Saint; and he is the be&s;t Catholick, as well as the be&s;t Citizen, in the Eye of the <HI>religious,</HI> who mo&s;t exerts him&s;elf on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190">THE Proce&s;&s;ion begins with a Cavalcade of all the Friars of all the Convents in and about the City. The&s;e walk two and two with folded Arms, and Eyes ca&s;t down to the very Ground, and with the greate&s;t out|ward Appearance of Humility imaginable; nor, though the Temptation from the fine Women that fill'd their Windows, or the rich Tape&s;tries that adorn'd the Balconies might be allow'd &s;ufficient to attract, could I ob&s;erve that any one of them all ever mov'd them upwards.</P>
<P>AFTER the Friars is borne, upon the Shoulders of twenty Men at lea&s;t, an Image of that Saint of &s;olid Silver, large as the Life: It is plac'd in a great Chair of Silver likewi&s;e; the Staves that bear him up, and upon which they bear him, being of the &s;ame Metal. The whole is a mo&s;t co&s;tly and curious Piece of Workman&s;hip, &s;uch as my Eyes never before or &s;ince beheld.</P>
<P>THE Magi&s;trates follow the Image and its Supporters, dre&s;s'd in their riche&s;t Ap|parel, which is always on this Day, and on this Occa&s;ion, particularly &s;umptuous and di&s;tingui&s;hing. Thus is the Image, in the greate&s;t Splendor, borne and accompany'd round that fine City; and at la&s;t convey'd to the Place from whence it came: And &s;o concludes that annual Ceremony.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Valencians,</HI> as to the Exteriors of Religion, are the mo&s;t devout of any in
<PB N="184" REF="191">
<HI>Spain,</HI> though in common Life you find them amorous, gallant, and gay, like other People; yet on &s;olemn Occa&s;ions there &s;hines out-right &s;uch a Spirit as proves them the very Bigots of Bigotry: As a Proof of which A&s;&s;ertion, I will now give &s;ome Ac|count of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, as I had time to make upon them, during two <HI>Lent</HI> Sea&s;ons, while I re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>THE Week before the <HI>Lent</HI> commences, commonly known by the Name of <HI>Car|naval Time,</HI> the whole City appears a per|fect <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair; the Streets are crouded, and the Hou&s;es empty; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s along without &s;ome Gambol or Jack-pudding Trick offer'd to you; Ink, Water, and &s;ometimes Ordure, are &s;ure to be hurl'd at your Face or Cloaths; and if you appear concern'd or angry, they rejoyce at it, pleas'd the more, the more they di&s;|plea&s;e; for all other Re&s;entment is at that time out of Sea&s;on, though at other times few in the World are fuller of Re&s;entment or more captious.</P>
<P>THE younger Gentry, or Dons, to ex|pre&s;s their Gallantry, carry about them Egg-&s;hells, fill'd with Orange or other &s;weet Water, which they ca&s;t at Ladies in their Coaches, or &s;uch other of the fair Sex as they happen to meet in the Streets.</P>
<P>BUT after all, if you would think them extravagant to Day, as much tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="185" REF="192">
the Rules of common Civility, and neither regarding Decency to one another, nor the Duty they owe to Almighty God; yet when <HI>A&s;h-Wedne&s;day</HI> comes you will ima|gine them more unaccountable in their Con|duct, being then as much too exce&s;&s;ive in all outwards Indications of Humility and Re|pentance. Here you &s;hall meet one, bare|footed, with a Cro&s;s on his Shoulder, a Burden rather fit for &s;omewhat with four Feet, and which his poor Two are ready to &s;ink under, yet the vain Wretch bears and &s;weats, and &s;weats and bears, in hope of finding Merit in an A&s;s's Labour.</P>
<P>OTHERS you &s;hall &s;ee naked to their Wa&s;tes, whipping them&s;elves with Scourges made for the Purpo&s;e, till the Blood fol|lows every Stroke; and no Man need be at a Lo&s;s to follow them by the very Tracks of Gore they &s;hed in this frentick Perambu|lation. Some, who from the Thickne&s;s of their Hides, or other Impediments, have not Power by their Scourgings to fetch Blood of them&s;elves, are follow'd by Surgeons with their Lancets, who, at every Turn, make u&s;e of them, to evince the Extent of their Patience and Zeal by the Smart of their Folly. While others, mingling Amour with Devotion, take particular Care to pre|&s;ent them&s;elves all macerated before the Windows of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and even in that Condition, not &s;atisfy'd with what they
<PB N="186" REF="193">
have barbarou&s;ly done to them&s;elves, they have their Operators at hand, to evince their Love by the Number of their Ga&s;hes and Wounds; imagining the more Blood they lo&s;e, the more Love they &s;hew, and the more they &s;hall gain. The&s;e are ge|nerally Devoto's of Quality; though the Tenet is univer&s;al, that he that is mo&s;t bloody is mo&s;t devout.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e Street-Exerci&s;es, the&s;e o&s;tentatious Ca&s;tigations are over, the&s;e Self-&s;acrificers repair to the great Church, the bloodier the better; there they throw them&s;elves, in a Condition too vile for the Eye of a Female, before the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>; though I defy all their Race of Fathers, and their infallible holy Father into the Bargain, to produce any Authority to fit it for Belief, that &s;he ever delighted in &s;uch &s;anguinary Holocau&s;ts.</P>
<P>DURING the whole Time of <HI>Lent,</HI> you will &s;ee in every Street &s;ome Prie&s;t or Frier, upon &s;ome Stall or Stool, preaching up Re|pentance to the People; and with violent Blows on his Brea&s;t crying aloud, <HI>Mia Culpa, mia maxima Culpa,</HI> till he extract reciprocal Returns from the Hands of his Auditors on their own Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Good-Friday</HI> is come they enter|tain it with the mo&s;t profound Show of Re|verence and Religion, both in their Streets and in their Churches. In the la&s;t, parti|cularly,
<PB N="187" REF="194">
they have contriv'd about twelve a-Clock &s;uddenly to darken them, &s;o as to render them quite gloomy. This they do to intimate the Eclip&s;e of the Sun, which at that time happen'd. And to &s;ignify the Rending of the Vail of the Temple, you are &s;truck with a &s;trange artificial Noi&s;e at the very &s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>BUT when <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Day appears, you find it in all Re&s;pects with them a Day of Rejoicing; for though Ab&s;tinence from Fle&s;h with them, who at no time eat much, is not &s;o great a Mortification as with tho&s;e of the &s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion in other Countries, who eat much more, yet there is a vi&s;ible Satisfa|ction darts out at their Eyes, which demon|&s;trates their inward Plea&s;ure in being &s;et free from the Confinement of Mind to the Di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Body. Every Per&s;on you now meet greets you with a <HI>Re&s;urrexit Je&s;us</HI>; a good Imitation of the primitive Chri&s;tians, were it the real Effect of Devo|tion. And all Sorts of the be&s;t Mu&s;ick (which here indeed is the be&s;t in all <HI>Spain</HI>) proclaim an au&s;picious Valediction to the de|parted Sea&s;on of &s;uperficial Sorrow and &s;tupid Super&s;tition. But enough of this: I proceed to weightier Matters.</P>
<P>WHILE we lay at <HI>Valencia,</HI> under the Vigilance and Care of the indefatigable Earl, News was brought that <HI>Alicant</HI> was be&s;ieg'd by General <HI>Gorge</HI> by Land, while
<PB N="188" REF="195">
a Squadron of Men of War batter'd it from the Sea; from both which the Be&s;iegers play'd their Parts &s;o well, and &s;o warmly ply'd them with their Cannon, that an in|different practicable Breach was made in a little time.</P>
<P><HI>MAHONI</HI> commanded in the Place, being again receiv'd into Favour; and clear'd as he was of tho&s;e political In&s;inua|tions before intimated, he now &s;eem'd re|&s;olv'd to confirm his Innocence by a re&s;o|lute Defence. However, perceiving that all Preparations tended towards a Storm, and knowing full well the Weakne&s;s of the Town, he withdrew his Garri&s;on into the Ca&s;tle, leaving the Town to the Defence of its own Inhabitants.</P>
<P>JUST as that was doing, the Sailors, not much skill'd in Sieges, nor at all times capable of the coole&s;t Con&s;ideration, with a Re&s;olution natural to them, &s;torm'd the Walls to the Side of the Sea; where not meeting with much Oppo&s;ition (for the People of the Town apprehended the lea&s;t Danger there) they &s;oon got into the Place; and, as &s;oon as got in, began to Plunder. This oblig'd the People, for the better Se|curity of them&s;elves, to open their Gates, and &s;eek a Refuge under one Enemy, in oppo&s;ition to the Rage of another.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Gorge,</HI> as &s;oon as he enter'd the Town, with a good deal of &s;eeming
<PB N="189" REF="196">
Lenity, put a &s;top to the Ravages of the Sailors; and ordered Proclamation to be made throughout the Place, that all the In|habitants &s;hould immediately bring in their be&s;t Effects into the great Church for their better Security. This was by the mi&s;taken Populace, as readily comply'd with; and neither Friend nor Foe at all di&s;puting the Command, or que&s;tioning the Integrity of the Intention; the Church was pre&s;ently crouded with Riches of all &s;orts and &s;izes. Yet after &s;ome time remaining there, they were all taken out, and di&s;po&s;ed of by tho&s;e, that had as little Property in 'em, as the Sailors, they were pretended to be pre&s;erv'd from.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> upon the very fir&s;t News of the Siege had left <HI>Valencia,</HI> and taken Shipping for <HI>Alicant</HI>; where he arrived &s;oon after the Surrender of the Town, and that Outcry of the Goods of the Towns-men. Upon his Arrival, <HI>Ma|honi,</HI> who was block'd up in the Ca&s;tle, and had experienced his indefatigable Di|ligence, being in want of Provi&s;ions, and without much hope of Relief, de&s;ired to capitulate. The Earl granted him honour|able Conditions, upon which he delivered up the Ca&s;tle, and <HI>Gorge</HI> was made Go|vernor.</P>
<P>UPON his Lord&s;hip's taking Ship at <HI>Va|lencia,</HI> I had an Opportunity of marching
<PB N="190" REF="197">
with tho&s;e Dragoons, which e&s;corted him from <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who had received Orders to march into <HI>Murcia.</HI> We quarter'd the fir&s;t Night at <HI>Alcira,</HI> a Town that the River <HI>Segra</HI> almo&s;t &s;urrounds, which renders it capable of being made a Place of va&s;t Strength, though now of &s;mall Importance.</P>
<P>THE next Night we lay at <HI>Xativa,</HI> a Place famous for its Steadine&s;s to King <HI>Charles.</HI> General <HI>Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> be|ing Governor; it was be&s;ieg'd by the Forces of King <HI>Philip</HI>; but after a noble Re&s;i&s;tance, the Enemy were beat off, and the Siege rai&s;ed; for which Effort, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that on the Retirement of King <HI>Charles</HI> out of this Country, it was depriv'd of its old Name <HI>Xativa,</HI> and is now called <HI>San Felippo</HI>; though to this day the Peo|ple thereabouts much di&s;&s;allow by their Practice, that novel Denomination.</P>
<P>WE march'd next Morning by <HI>Monte|za</HI>; which gives Name to the famous Title of Knights of <HI>Monteza.</HI> It was at the Time that Colonel <HI>O Guaza,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> was Governor, be&s;ieg'd by the People of the Country, in favour of King <HI>Charles</HI>; but very ineffectually, &s;o it never chang'd its Sovereign. That Night we quarter'd at <HI>Fonte dalas Figuras,</HI> within one League of <HI>Almanza</HI>; where that fatal and unfortu|nate Battle, which I &s;hall give an Account
<PB N="191" REF="198">
of in its Place, was fought the Year after, under the Lord <HI>Galway.</HI></P>
<P>ON our fourth days March we were o|blig'd to pa&s;s <HI>Villena,</HI> where the Enemy had a Garri&s;on. A Party of <HI>Mahoni</HI>'s Dragoons made a part of that Garri&s;on, and they were commanded by Major <HI>Oroirk</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officer, who always carried the Re|putation of a good Soldier, and a brave Gentleman.</P>
<P>I had all along made it my Ob&s;ervation, that Captain <HI>Matthews,</HI> who commanded tho&s;e Dragoons, that I march'd with, was a Per&s;on of much more Courage than Con|duct; and he us'd as little Precaution here, though ju&s;t marching under the Eye of the Enemy, as he had done at other Times. As I was become intimately acquainted with him, I rode up to him, and told him the Danger, which, in my Opinion, attended our pre&s;ent March. I pointed out to him ju&s;t before <HI>Villena</HI> a jutting Hill, under which we mu&s;t unavoidably pa&s;s; at the turning whereof, I was apprehen&s;ive the Enemy might lie, and either by Ambu&s;cade or otherwi&s;e, &s;urprize us; I therefore in|treated we might either wait the coming of our Rear Guard; or at lea&s;t march with a little more lei&s;ure and caution. But he taking little notice of all I &s;aid, kept on his round March; &s;eeing which, I pre&s;s'd forward my Mule, which was a very good
<PB N="192" REF="199">
one, and rid as fa&s;t as her Legs could carry her, till I had got on the top of the Hill. When I came there, I found both my Ex|pectation, and my Apprehen&s;ions an&s;wer'd: For I could very plainly di&s;cern three Squa|drons of the Enemy ready drawn up, and waiting for Us at the very winding of the Hill.</P>
<P>HEREUPON I ha&s;tened back to the Captain with the like Speed, and told him the Di&s;covery I had made; who never|thele&s;s kept on his March, and it was with a good deal of Difficulty, that I at la&s;t pre|vail'd on him to halt, till our Rear Guard of twenty Men had got up to us. But tho&s;e joining us, and a new Troop of <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Dragoons, who had march'd towards us that Morning, appearing in Sight; our Captain, as if he was afraid of their rival|ling him in his Glory, at the very turn of the Hill, rode in a full Gallop, with Sword in Hand, up to the Enemy. They &s;tood their Ground, till we were advanc'd within two hundred Yards of them; and then in Confu&s;ion endeavoured to retire into the Town.</P>
<P>THEY were obliged to pa&s;s over a &s;mall Bridge, too &s;mall to admit of &s;uch a Com|pany in &s;o much ha&s;te; their crouding upon which ob&s;tructed their Retreat, and left all that could not get over, to the Mercy of our Swords, which &s;par'd none. However
<PB N="193" REF="200">
narrow as the Bridge was, Captain <HI>Mat|thews</HI> was re&s;olved to venture over after the Enemy; on doing which, the Enemy made a halt, till the People of the Town, and the very Prie&s;ts came out to their Re|lief with fire Arms. On &s;o large an Ap|pearance, Captain <HI>Matthews</HI> thought it not advi&s;eable to make any further Advances; &s;o driving a very great flock of Sheep from under the Walls, he continued his March towards <HI>Elda.</HI> In this Action we lo&s;t Captain <HI>Topham,</HI> and three Dragoons.</P>
<P>I remember we were not marched very far from the Place, where this Rencounter happen'd; when an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Dragoon over|took the Captain, with a civil Me&s;&s;age from Major <HI>O Rairk,</HI> de&s;iring that he would not entertain a mean Opinion of him for the Defence that was made; &s;ince could he have got the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to have &s;tood their Ground, he &s;hould have given him good Rea&s;on for a better. The Captain return'd a complimental An&s;wer, and &s;o march'd on. This Major <HI>O Rairk,</HI> or <HI>O Roork,</HI> was the next Year killed at <HI>Alkay,</HI> being much la|mented, for he was e&s;teemed both for his Courage and Conduct, one of the be&s;t of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service. I was likewi&s;e informed that he was de&s;cend|ed from one of the ancient Kings of <HI>Ireland</HI>; the Mother of the honourable Colonel <HI>Pa|get,</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="201">
one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, was nearly related to this Gallant Gentleman.</P>
<P>ONE remarkable Thing I &s;aw in that Action, which affected and &s;urprized me: A <HI>Scotch</HI> Dragoon, of but a moderate Size, with his large basket-hilted Sword, &s;truck off a <HI>Spaniard's</HI> Head at one &s;troke, with the &s;ame ea&s;e, in appearance, as a Man would do that of a Poppy.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Elda</HI> (a Town much in the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and famous for its fine Situation, and the large&s;t Grapes in <HI>Spain</HI>) the Inhabitants received us in a manner as hand&s;ome as it was peculiar; all &s;tanding at their Doors with lighted Torches; which con&s;idering the Time we enter'd was far from an unwelcome or di&s;|agreeable Sight.</P>
<P>THE next Day &s;everal reque&s;ted to be the Me&s;&s;engers of the Action at <HI>Villena</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> at <HI>Alicant</HI>; but the Captain return'd this An&s;wer to all, that in con&s;ideration of the Share that I might ju&s;t|ly claim in that Day's Tran&s;actions, he could not think of letting any other Per&s;on be the Bearer. So giving me his Letters to the Earl, I the next Day deliver'd them to him at <HI>Alicant.</HI> At the Delivery, Colonel <HI>Killegrew</HI> (who&s;e Dragoons they were) being pre&s;ent, he expre&s;&s;ed a deal of Sati&s;|faction
<PB N="195" REF="202">
at the Account, and his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed at the &s;ame time to appoint me &s;ole Engineer of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Alicant.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after which, that &s;ucce&s;sful Gene|ral embark'd for <HI>Genoa,</HI> according to the Re&s;olutions of the Council of War at <HI>Guadalaxara,</HI> on a particular Commi&s;&s;ion from the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> another from <HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and charged at the &s;ame time with a Reque&s;t of the Marqui&s;s <HI>das Minas,</HI> General of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Forces, to negotiate Bills for one hundred thou&s;and Pounds for the u&s;e of his Troops. In all which, tho' he was (as ever) &s;ucce&s;s|ful; yet may it be &s;aid without a figure, that his Departure, in a good mea&s;ure, de|termin'd the Succe&s;s of the confederate Forces in that Kingdom. True it is, the General return'd again with the fortunate Fruits of tho&s;e Negotiations; but never to act in his old au&s;picious Sphere: And there|fore, as I am now to take leave of this for|tunate General, let me do it with Ju&s;tice, in an Appeal to the World, of the not to be parallel'd U&s;age (in the&s;e latter Ages, at lea&s;t) that he met with for all his Services; &s;uch a va&s;t variety of Enterprizes, all &s;uc|ce&s;sful, and which had &s;et all <HI>Europe</HI> in amaze; Services that had given occa&s;ion to &s;uch &s;olemn and publick Thank&s;givings in our Churches, and which had received &s;uch ve|ry remarkable Approbations, both of Sove|reign

for my Intere&s;t, and for the Service of my Per&s;on. I owe the &s;ame Ju&s;tice to Bri|gadier <HI>Stanhope,</HI> for his great Zeal, Vigi|lance, and very wi&s;e Conduct, which he has given Proofs of upon all Occa&s;ions: As al&s;o to all your Officers of the Fleet, particularly to your worthy Admiral <HI>Shovel,</HI> a&s;&s;uring your Maje&s;ty, that he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in this Expedition, with an inconceivable Readi|ne&s;s and Application, and that no Admiral will be ever better able to render me greater Satisfaction, than he has done. During the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> &s;ome of your Maje|&s;ty's Ships, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Troops of the Country, have reduc'd the Town of <HI>Tarragona,</HI> and the Officers are made Pri|&s;oners of War.

<P>THIS, Madam, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">te that your Arms, and the Inclination of the People have put my Affairs in. It is unnece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="198" REF="205">
to tell you what &s;tops the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Conque&s;ts; it is not the Sea&s;on of the Year, nor the Enemy; the&s;e are no Ob&s;tacles to your Troops, who de&s;ire nothing more than to act under the Conduct that your Ma|je&s;ty has appointed them. The taking of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> with &s;o &s;mall a Number of Troops, is very remarkable; and what has been done in this Siege is almo&s;t without Example; that with &s;even or eight thou&s;and Men of your Troops, and two hundred <HI>Mi|quelets,</HI> we &s;hould &s;urround and inve&s;t a Place, that thirty thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> could not block up.</P>
<P>AFTER a March of thirteen Hours, the Troops climb'd up the Rocks and Pre|cipices, to attack a Fortification &s;tronger than the Place, which the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow</HI> has &s;ent you a Plan of; two Ge|nerals, with the Grenadiers, attack'd it Sword in Hand. In which Action the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> died gloriou&s;ly, after &s;o many brave Actions: I hope his Brother and his Family will always have your Maje&s;ty's Protection. With eight hundred Men they forc'd the cover'd Way, and all the Intrenchments and Works, one after an|other, till they came to the la&s;t Work which &s;urrounded it, again&s;t five hundred Men of regular Troops which defended the Place, and a Reinforcement they had receiv'd; and three Days afterwards we became
<PB N="199" REF="206">
Ma&s;ters of the Place. We afterwards at|tack'd the Town on the Side of the Ca&s;tle. We landed again our Cannon, and the other Artillery, with inconceivable Trouble, and form'd two Camps, di&s;tant from each other three Leagues, again&s;t a Garri&s;on almo&s;t as numerous as our Army, who&s;e Cavalry was double the Strength of ours. The fir&s;t Camp was &s;o well intrench'd, that 'twas defended by two thou&s;and Men and the Dragoons; whil&s;t we attack'd the Town with the re&s;t of our Troops. The Breach being made, we prepar'd to make a general A&s;&s;ault with all the Army. The&s;e are Circum&s;tances, Madam, which di&s;tingui&s;h this Action, perhaps, from all others.</P>
<P>HERE has happen'd an unfore&s;een Accident. The Cruelty of the pretended Viceroy, and the Report &s;pread abroad, that he would take away the Pri&s;oners, contrary to the Capitulation, provok'd the Burghers, and &s;ome of the Country People, to take up Arms again&s;t the Garri&s;on, whil&s;t they were bu&s;y in packing up their Baggage, which was to be &s;ent away the next Day; &s;o that every thing tended to Slaughter: But your Maje&s;ty's Troops, entering into Town with the Earl of <HI>Peter|borow,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;eeking Pillage, a Pra|ctice common upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, appeas'd the Tumult, and have &s;av'd the Town, and even the Lives of their Enemies, with a

Di&s;cipline and Genero&s;ity without Ex|ample.</P>
<P>WHAT remains is, that I return you my mo&s;t hearty Thanks for &s;ending &s;o great a Fleet, and &s;uch good and valiant Troops to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. After &s;o happy a Begin|ning, I have thought it proper, according to the Sentiments of your Generals and Ad|mirals, to &s;upport, by my Pre&s;ence, the Conque&s;ts that we have made; and to &s;hew my Subjects, &s;o affectionate to my Per|&s;on, that I cannot abandon them.

But, Madam, I &s;acrifice my Per&s;on, and my Subjects in <HI>Catalonia</HI> expo&s;e al&s;o their Lives and Fortunes, upon the A&s;&s;urances they have of your Maje&s;ty's generous Pro|tection.

But I proceed to my Me|moirs.</P>
<P><HI>ALICANT</HI> is a Town of the greate&s;t Trade of any in the Kingdom of <HI>Valencia,</HI> having a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, being &s;ituated on a high Hill, which commands both Town and Harbour. In this Place I re&s;ided a whole Year; but it was &s;oon after my fir&s;t Arrival, that Major <HI>Collier</HI> (who was &s;hot in the Back at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> as I have related in the Siege of that Place) hearing of me, &s;ought me out at my Quarters; and, after a particular Enquiry into the Succe&s;s of that difficult Task that he left me upon, and my
<PB N="204" REF="211">
an&s;wering all his Que&s;tions to &s;atisfaction (all which he receiv'd with evident Plea|&s;ure) he threw down a Pur&s;e of Pi&s;toles upon the Table; which I refu&s;ing, he told me, in a mo&s; hand&s;ome Manner, his Friend|&s;hip was not to be pre&s;erv'd but by my ac|cepting it.</P>
<P>AFTER I had made &s;ome very nece&s;&s;ary Repairs, I pur&s;u'd the Orders I had receiv'd from the Earl of <HI>Peterborow,</HI> to go upon the erecting a new Battery between the Ca&s;tle and the Town. This was a Task attended with Difficulties, neither few in Number, nor &s;mall in Con&s;equence; for it was to be rais'd upon a great Declivity, which mu&s;t render the Work both laborious and precarious. However, I had the good Fortune to effect it much &s;ooner than was expected; and it was call'd <HI>Gorge</HI>'s Battery, from the Name of the Governor then com|manding; who, out of an uncommon Pro|fu&s;ion of Genero&s;ity, wetted that Piece of Go&s;&s;iping with a di&s;tingui&s;hing Bowl of Punch. Brigadier <HI>Bougard,</HI> when he &s;aw this Work &s;ome time after, was pleas'd to honour it with a &s;ingular Admiration and Approbation, for its Compleatne&s;s, not|with&s;tanding its Difficulties.</P>
<P>THIS Work, and the Siege of <HI>Carta|gena,</HI> then in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> brought the Lord <HI>Galway</HI> down to this Place. <HI>Cartagena</HI> is of &s;o
<PB N="205" REF="212">
little Di&s;tance from <HI>Alicant,</HI> that we could ea&s;ily hear the Cannon playing again&s;t, and from it, in our Ca&s;tle, where I then was. And I remember my Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> on the fourth Day of the Siege, &s;ending to know if I could make any u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations, as to the Succe&s;s of it; I return'd, that I was of Opinion the Town was &s;urrender'd, from the &s;udden Ce&s;&s;ation of the Cannon, which, by our News next Day from the Place, prov'd to be fact. <HI>Cartagena</HI> is a &s;mall Sea-Port Town in <HI>Murcia</HI>; but has &s;o good an Harbour, that when the famous Admiral <HI>Doria</HI> was ask'd, which were the three be&s;t Havens in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> he readily return'd, <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>Carta|gena.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the Surrender of this Place, a De|tachment of Foot was &s;ent by the Governor, with &s;ome Dragoons, to <HI>El&s;ha</HI>; but it be|ing a Place of very little Strength they were &s;oon made Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>THE Siege of <HI>Cartagena</HI> being over, the Lord <HI>Galway</HI> return'd to his Camp; and the Lord <HI>Duncannon</HI> dying in <HI>Alicant,</HI> the fir&s;t Guns that were fir'd from <HI>Gorge</HI>'s Bat|tery, were the Minute-Guns for his Fune|ral. His Regiment had been given to the Lord <HI>Montandre,</HI> who lo&s;t it before he had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by an Action as odd as it was &s;candalous.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">THAT Regiment had received Orders to march to the Lord <HI>Galway's</HI> Camp, under the Command of their Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Bateman,</HI> a Per&s;on before reputedly a good Officer, tho' his Conduct here gave People, not invidious, too much Rea&s;on to call it in Que&s;tion. On his March, he was &s;o very carele&s;s and negligent (though he knew him&s;elf in a Country &s;urrounded with Enemies, and that he was to march through a Wood, where they every Day made their Appearance in great Numbers) that his Soldiers march'd with their Mu&s;|kets &s;lung at their Backs, and went one after another (as nece&s;&s;ity had forc'd us to do in <HI>Scotland</HI>) him&s;elf at the Head of 'em, in his Chai&s;e, riding a con&s;iderable way before.</P>
<P>IT happened there was a Captain, with three&s;core Dragoons, detatch'd from the Duke of <HI>Berwick's</HI> Army, with a De&s;ign to intercept &s;ome Ca&s;h, that was order'd to be &s;ent to Lord <HI>Galway's</HI> Army from <HI>A|licant.</HI> This Detachment, mi&s;&s;ing of that intended Prize, was returning very di&s;con|&s;olately, <HI>Re infecta</HI>; when their Captain, ob&s;erving that carele&s;s and di&s;orderly March of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> re&s;olv'd, boldly enough, to attack them in the Wood. To that Purpo&s;e he &s;ecreted his little Party behind a great Barn; and &s;o &s;oon as they were half pa&s;&s;ed by, he falls upon 'em in the Center with
<PB N="207" REF="214">
his Dragoons, cutting and &s;la&s;hing at &s;uch a violent Rate, that he &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed the whole Regiment, leaving many dead and wounded upon the Spot. The three Co|lours were taken; and the gallant Lieu|tenant-Colonel taken out of his Chai&s;e, and carried away Pri&s;oner with many others; only one Officer who was an En&s;ign, and &s;o bold as to do his Duty, was kill'd.</P>
<P>THE Lieutenant who commanded the Granadiers, received the Alarm time enough to draw his Men into a Hou&s;e in their way; where he bravely defended him&s;elf for a long Time; but being killed, the re&s;t imme|diately &s;urrender'd. The Account of this Action I had from the Commander of the Enemy's Party him&s;elf, &s;ome Time after, while I was a Pri&s;oner. And Captain <HI>Ma|honi,</HI> who was pre&s;ent when the News was brought, that a few <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dragoons had defeated an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiment, which was this under <HI>Bateman,</HI> prote&s;ted to me, that the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> turn'd pale at the Relation; and when they offer'd to bring the Colours before him, he would not &s;o much as &s;ee them. A little before the Duke went to Supper, <HI>Bateman</HI> him|&s;elf was brought to him, but the Duke turn'd away from him without any further Notice than coldly &s;aying, that <HI>he thought he was very &s;trangely taken.</HI> The Wags of the Army made a thorough je&s;t of him, and

&s;aid his military Conduct was of a piece with his Oeconomy, having two Days be|fore this March, &s;ent his young hand&s;ome Wife into <HI>England,</HI> under the Guardian&s;hip of the young Chaplain of the Regiment.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 15. IN the Year 1707, being <HI>Ea&s;ter Monday,</HI> we had in the Morning a flying Report in <HI>Alicant,</HI> that there had been the Day before a Battle at <HI>Almanza,</HI> between the Army under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and that of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> in which the latter had &s;uffer'd an entire Defeat. We at fir&s;t gave no great Credit to it: But, alas, we were too &s;oon wofully convinced of the Truth of it, by Numbers that came flying to us from the conquering Enemy. Then indeed we were &s;atisfied of Truths, too dif|ficult before to be credited. But as I was not pre&s;ent in that calamitous Battle, I &s;hall relate it, as I received it from an Offi|cer then in the Duke's Army.</P>
<P>TO bring the Lord <HI>Galway</HI> to a Battle, in a Place mo&s;t commodious for his pur|po&s;e, the Duke made u&s;e of this Strata|gem: He ordered two <HI>Iri&s;hmen,</HI> both Offi|cers, to make their way over to the Enemy as De&s;erters; putting this Story in their Mouths, that the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was in a full March to join the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> with twelve thou&s;and Men; that this would be done in two Days, and that then they
<PB N="209" REF="216">
would find out the Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> and force him to Fight, where-ever they found him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of <HI>Almanza.</HI></NOTE>LORD <HI>Galway,</HI> who at this Time lay before <HI>Villena,</HI> receiving this Intelligence from tho&s;e well in&s;tructed De&s;erters, im|mediately rais'd the Siege; with a Re&s;olu|tion, by a ha&s;ty March, to force the E|nemy to Battle, before the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> &s;hould be able to join the Duke of <HI>Berwick.</HI> To effect this, after a hard March of three long <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leagues in the heat of the Day; he appears a little after Noon in the face of the Enemy with his fatiegu'd Forces. Glad and rejoyc'd at the Sight, for he found his Plot had taken; <HI>Berwick,</HI> the better to receive him, draws up his Army in a half Moon, placing at a pretty good Advance three Regiments to make up the Centre, with expre&s;s Order, neverthele&s;s, to re|treat at the very fir&s;t Charge. All which was punctually ob&s;erv'd, and had its de&s;ired Effect: For the three Regiments, at the fir&s;t Attack gave way, and &s;eemingly fled towards their Camp; the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> after their cu&s;tomary Manner, pur&s;uing them with Shouts and Hollowings. As &s;oon as the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> perceiv'd his Trap had taken, he order'd his right and left Wings to clo&s;e; by which Means, he at once cut off from the re&s;t of their Army all tho&s;e who had &s;o eagerly pur&s;u'd the imaginary Runa|ways. In &s;hort, the Rout was total, and
<PB N="210" REF="217">
the mo&s;t fatal Blow that ever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re|ceiv'd during the whole War with <HI>Spain.</HI> Nor, as it is thought, with a great probabi|lity of Rea&s;on, had tho&s;e Troops that made their Retreat to the Top of the Hills, under Major General <HI>Shrimpton,</HI> met with any bet|ter Fate than tho&s;e on the Plain, had the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had any other General in the Command than the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI>; who&s;e native Sympathy gave a check to the Ardour of a victorious Enemy. And this was the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves after the Battle. Verifying herein that no|ble Maxim, <HI>That Victory to generous Minds is only an Inducement to Moderation.</HI></P>
<P>THE Day after this fatal Battle (which gave occa&s;ion to a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> piece of Wit, <HI>that the Engli&s;h General had routed the French</HI>) the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> did arrive indeed in the Camp, but with an Army of only fourteen Attendants.</P>
<P>THE fatal Effects of this Battle were &s;oon made vi&s;ible, and to none more than tho&s;e in <HI>Alicant.</HI> The Enemy grew every Day more and more trouble&s;ome; vi&s;iting us in Parties more boldly than before; and often hovering about us &s;o very near, that with our Cannon we could hardly teach 'em to keep a proper Di&s;tance. <HI>Gorge</HI> the Gover|nor of <HI>Alicant</HI> being recall'd into <HI>England,</HI> Major General <HI>Richards</HI> was by King <HI>Charles</HI> appointed Governor in his Place.
<PB N="211" REF="218">
He was a Roman Catholick, and very much belov'd by the Natives on that Account; tho' to give him his due, he behaved him|&s;elf extremely well in all other Re&s;pects. It was in his Time, that a De&s;ign was laid of &s;urprizing <HI>Guardamere,</HI> a &s;mall Sea-port Town in <HI>Murcia</HI>: But the military Bi&s;hop (for he was in a literal Sen&s;e excellent <HI>tam Marte, quam Mercurio,</HI> among his many others Exploits, by a timely Expedition, prevented that.</P>
<P>GOVERNOR <HI>Richards,</HI> my Po&s;t being always in the Ca&s;tle, had &s;ent to de&s;ire me to give notice whenever I &s;aw any Parties of the Enemy moving. Pur&s;uant to this Order, di&s;covering one Morning a con&s;ider|able body of Hor&s;e towards <HI>El&s;ha,</HI> I went down into the Town, and told the Gover|nor what I had &s;een; and without any de|lay he gave his Orders, that a Captain with three&s;core Men &s;hould attend me to an old Hou&s;e about a Mile di&s;tance. As &s;oon as we had got into it, I &s;et about barricading all the open Places, and Avenues, and put my Men in a Po&s;ture ready to receive an Enemy, as &s;oon as he &s;hould appear; upon which the Captain, as a feint, ordered a few of his Men to &s;hew them&s;elves on a ri&s;ing Ground ju&s;t before the Hou&s;e. But we had like to have caught a Tartar: For tho' the Enemy took the Train I had laid, and on &s;ight of our &s;mall Body on the Hill,
<PB N="212" REF="219">
&s;ent a Party from their greater Body to in|tercept them, before they could reach the Town; yet the Sequel prov'd, we had mi&s;taken their Number, and it &s;oon appeared to be much greater than we at fir&s;t imagin'd. However our Out-&s;couts, as I may call 'em, got &s;afe into the Hou&s;e; and on the Appear|ance of the Party, we let fly a full Volly, which laid dead on the Spot three Men and one Hor&s;e. Hereupon the whole Body made up to the Hou&s;e, but &s;tood a-loof up|on the Hill without reach of our Shot. We &s;oon &s;aw our Danger from the number of the Enemy: And well for us it was, that the watchful Governor had taken notice of it, as well as we in the Hou&s;e. For ob|&s;erving us &s;urrounded with the Enemy, and by a Power &s;o much &s;uperior, he marched him&s;elf with a good part of the Garri&s;on to our Relief. The Enemy &s;tood a little time as if they would receive 'em; but upon &s;econd thoughts they retir'd; and to our no little Joy left us at Liberty to come out of the Hou&s;e and join the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>SCARCE a Day pa&s;s'd but we had &s;ome vi&s;its of the like kind attended &s;ometimes with Rencounters of this Nature; in &s;o much that there was hardly any &s;tirring out in Safety for &s;mall Parties, tho' never &s;o little away. There was within a little Mile of the Town, an old Vineyard, envi|roned with a lo&s;e &s;tone Wall: An Officer
<PB N="213" REF="220">
and I made an Agreement to ride thither for an Airing. We did &s;o, and after a little riding, it came into my Head to put a Fright upon the Officer. And very lucky for us both was that unlucky Thought of mine; pretending to &s;ee a Party of the Enemy make up to us, I gave him the Alarm, &s;et Spurs to my Hor&s;e, and rid as fa&s;t as Legs could carry me. The Officer no way bated of his Speed; and we had &s;carce got out of the Vineyard but my Je&s;t prov'd Earne&s;t, twelve of the Enemy's Hor&s;e pur&s;uing us to the very Gates of the Town. Nor could I ever after prevail upon my Fellow-Traveller to believe that he ow'd his E&s;cape to Merri|ment more than Speed.</P>
<P>SOON after my Charge, as to the Forti|fications, was pretty well over, I obtain'd Leave of the Governor to be ab&s;ent for a Fortnight, upon &s;ome Affairs of my own at <HI>Valencia.</HI> On my Return from whence, at a Town call'd <HI>Veni&s;&s;a,</HI> I met two Officers of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiment, going to the Place from whence I la&s;t came. They told me, after common Congratulations, that they had left Major <HI>Boyd,</HI> at a little Place call'd <HI>Capel,</HI> hiring another Mule, that he rode on thither having tir'd and fail'd him; de|&s;iring withal, that if I met him, I would let him know that they would &s;tay for him at that Place. I had another Gentleman in my Company, and we had travell'd on not

above a League further, whence, at a little Di&s;tance, we were both &s;urpriz'd with a Sight that &s;eem'd to have &s;et all Art at de|fiance, and was too odd for any thing in Nature. It appear'd all in red, and to move; but &s;o very &s;lowly, that if we had not made more way to that than it did to us, we &s;hould have made it a Day's Journey be|fore we met it. My Companion could as little tell what to make of it as I; and, in|deed, the nearer it came the more mon|&s;trous it &s;eem'd, having nothing of the Tokens of Man, either Walking, Riding, or in any Po&s;ture whatever. At la&s;t, com|ing up with this &s;trange Figure of a Creature (for now we found it was certainly &s;uch) what, or rather who, &s;hould it prove to be, but Major <HI>Boyd?</HI> He was a Per&s;on of him|&s;elf far from one of the lea&s;t Proportion, and mounted on a poor little A&s;s, with all his warlike Accoutrements upon it, you will al|low mu&s;t make a Figure almo&s;t as odd as one of the old <HI>Centaurs.</HI> The Morocco Saddle that cover'd the A&s;s was of Burden enough for the Bea&s;t without its Ma&s;ter; and the additional Hol&s;ters and Pi&s;tols made it much more weighty. Neverthele&s;s, a Curb-Bridle of the large&s;t Size cover'd his little Head, and a long red Cloak, hang|ing down to the Ground, cover'd Jack|boots, A&s;s, Ma&s;ter and all. In &s;hort, my Companion and I, after we could &s;pecifi|cally
<PB N="215" REF="222">
declare it to be a Man, agreed we never &s;aw a Figure &s;o comical in all our Lives. When we had merrily greeted our Major (for a <HI>Cynick</HI> could not have forborn Laughter) He excus'd all as well as he could, by &s;aying he could get no other Bea&s;t. After which, delivering our Me&s;&s;age, and condoling with him for his pre&s;ent Mounting, and wi&s;hing him better at his next Quarters, he &s;ettled into his old Pace, and we into ours, and parted.</P>
<P>WE lay that Night at <HI>Altea,</HI> famous for its Bay for Ships to water at. It &s;tands on a high Hill; and is adorn'd, not defended, with an old Fort.</P>
<P>THENCE we came to <HI>Alicant,</HI> where having now been a whole Year, and having effected what was held nece&s;&s;ary, I once more prevail'd upon the Governor to per|mit me to take another Journey. The Lord <HI>Galway</HI> lay at <HI>Tarraga,</HI> while <HI>Le|rida</HI> lay under the Siege of the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>; and having &s;ome Grounds of Ex|pectation given me, while he was at <HI>Ali|cant,</HI> I re&s;olv'd at lea&s;t to demon&s;trate I was &s;till living. The Governor favour'd me with Letters, not at all to my Di&s;ad|vantage; &s;o taking Ship for <HI>Barcelona,</HI> ju&s;t at our putting into the Harbour, we met with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, on its Return from the Expedition to <HI>Toulon</HI> under Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ly Shovel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223">I STAY'D but very few Days at <HI>Barce|lona,</HI> and then proceeded on my intended Journey to <HI>Tarraga</HI>; arriving at which Place I deliver'd my Packet to the Lord <HI>Galway,</HI> who receiv'd me with very great Civility; and to double it, acquainted me at the &s;ame time, that the Governor of <HI>Ali|cant</HI> had wrote very much in my Favour: But though it was a known Part of that noble Lord's Character, that the fir&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ion was generally &s;tronge&s;t, I had Rea&s;on &s;oon after to clo&s;e with another Saying, equally true, <HI>That general Rules always admit of &s;ome Exception.</HI> While I was here we had News of the taking of the Town of <HI>Lerida</HI>; the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> (Brother to that brave Prince who lo&s;t his Life before <HI>Monjouick</HI>) retiring into the Ca&s;tle with the Garri&s;on, which he bravely defended a long time after.</P>
<P>WHEN I was thus attending my Lord <HI>Galway</HI> at <HI>Tarraga,</HI> he receiv'd Intelli|gence that the Enemy had a De&s;ign to lay Siege to <HI>Denia</HI>; whereupon he gave me Orders to repair there as Engineer. After I had receiv'd my Orders, and taken Leave of his Lord&s;hip, I &s;et out, re&s;olving, &s;ince it was left to my Choice, to go by way of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and there take Shipping for the Place of my Station; by which I pro|pos'd to &s;ave more time than would allow me a full Opportunity of vi&s;iting <HI>Mont&s;erat,</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="224">
a Place I had heard much Talk of, which had fill'd me with a longing De&s;ire to &s;ee it. To &s;ay Truth, I had been told &s;uch extra|vagant Things of the Place, that I could hardly impute more than one half of it to any thing but <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Rhodomontado's, the Vice of extravagant Exaggeration being too natural to that Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of <HI>Mont|&s;erat.</HI></NOTE><HI>MONTSERAT</HI> is a ri&s;ing lofty Hill, in the very Middle of a &s;pacious Plain, in the Principality of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> about &s;even Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Barcelona</HI> to the We&s;t|ward, &s;omewhat inclining to the North. At the very fir&s;t Sight, its Oddne&s;s of Fi|gure promi&s;es &s;omething extraordinary; and even at that Di&s;tance the Pro&s;pect makes &s;omewhat of a grand Appearance: Hun|dreds of a&s;piring Pyramids pre&s;enting them|&s;elves all at once to the Eye, look, if I may be allowed &s;o to &s;peak, like a little pe|trify'd Forre&s;t; or, rather, like the awful Ruins of &s;ome capacious Structure, the La|bour of venerable Antiquity. The nearer you approach the more it affects; but till you are very near you can hardly form in your Mind any thing like what you find it when you come clo&s;e to it. Till ju&s;t upon it you would imagine it a perfect Hill of Steeples; but &s;o intermingled with Trees of Magnitude, as well as Beauty, that your Admiration can never be tir'd, or your Cu|rio&s;ity &s;urfeited. Such I &s;ound it on my Ap|proach;
<PB N="218" REF="225">
yet much le&s;s than what I found it, was &s;o &s;oon as I enter'd upon the very Pre|mi&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>NOW that &s;tupendious Clu&s;ter of Pyra|mids affected me in a Manner different to all before; and I found it &s;o finely group'd with verdant Groves, and here and there inter|&s;pers'd with a&s;piring, but &s;olitary Trees, that it no way le&s;&s;ened my Admiration, while it increa&s;ed my Delight. Tho&s;e Trees, which I call &s;olitary, as &s;tanding &s;ingle, in oppo&s;ition to the numerous Groves, which are clo&s;e and thick (as I ob&s;erv'd when I a&s;cended to take a View of the &s;everal Cells) ri&s;e generally out of the very Clefts of the main Rock, with nothing, to Ap|pearance, but a Soil or Bed of Stone for their Nurture. But though &s;ome few Na|turali&s;ts may a&s;&s;ert, that the Nitre in the Stone may afford a due Proportion of Nou|ri&s;hment to Trees and Vegetables; the&s;e, in my Opinion, were all too beautiful, their Bark, Leaf, and Flowers, carry'd too fair a Face of Health, to allow them even to be the Fo&s;ter-children of Rock and Stone only.</P>
<P>UPON this Hill, or if you plea&s;e, Grove of Rocks, are thirteen Hermits Cells, the la&s;t of which lies near the very Summit. You gradually advance to every one, from Bottom to Top, by a winding A&s;cent; which to do would otherwi&s;e be impo&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the Steepne&s;s; but though there
<PB N="219" REF="226">
is a winding A&s;cent to every Cell, as I have &s;aid, I would yet &s;et at defiance the mo&s;t ob&s;ervant, if a Stranger, to find it fea&s;ible to vi&s;it them in order, if not precaution'd to follow the poor <HI>Borigo,</HI> or old A&s;s, that with Paniers hanging on each Side of him, mounts regularly, and daily, up to every particular Cell. The Manner is as fol|lows:</P>
<P>IN the Paniers there are thirteen Parti|tions; one for every Cell. At the Hour ap|pointed, the Servant having plac'd the Pa|niers on his Back, the A&s;s, of him&s;elf, goes to the Door of the Convent at the very Foot of the Hill, where every Partition is &s;up|ply'd with their &s;everal Allowances of Vi|ctuals and Wine. Which, as &s;oon as he has receiv'd, without any further Atten|dance, or any Guide, he mounts and takes the Cells gradually, in their due Cour&s;e, till he reaches the very uppermo&s;t. Where having di&s;charg'd his Duty, he de&s;cends the &s;ame Way, lighter by the Load he carry'd up. This the poor &s;tupid Drudge fails not to do, Day and Night, at the &s;tated Hours.</P>
<P>TWO Gentlemen, who had join'd me on the Road, alike led by Curio&s;ity, &s;eem'd alike delighted, that the End of it was &s;o well an&s;wer'd. I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover in their Countenances a Satisfaction, which, if it did not give a Sanction to my own, much
<PB N="220" REF="227">
confirm'd it, while they &s;eem'd to allow with me that the&s;e reverend Solitaries were truly happy Men: I then thought them &s;uch; and a thou&s;and times &s;ince, reflecting within my &s;elf, have wi&s;h'd, bating their Errors, and le&s;&s;er Super&s;titions, my &s;elf as happily &s;ta|tion'd: For what can there be wanting to a happy Life, where all things nece&s;&s;ary are provided without Care? Where the Days, without Anxiety or Troubles, may be grate|fully pa&s;&s;ed away, with an innocent Va|riety of diverting and plea&s;ing Objects, and where their Sleeps and Slumbers are never interrupted with any thing more offen&s;ive, than murmuring Springs, natural Ca&s;cades, or the various Songs of the pretty feather'd Quiri&s;ters.</P>
<P>BUT their Courte&s;y to Strangers is no le&s;s engaging than their Solitude. A reclu&s;e Life, for the Fruits of it, generally &s;peaking, produces Moro&s;ene&s;s; Phari&s;aical Pride too often &s;ours the Temper; and a mi&s;taken O|pinion of their own Merit too naturally leads &s;uch Men into a Contempt of others: But on the contrary, the&s;e good Men (for I mu&s;t call them as I thought them) &s;eem'd to me the very Emblems of Innocence; &s;o ready to oblige others, that at the &s;ame In|&s;tant they &s;eem'd laying Obligations upon them&s;elves. This is &s;elf-evident, in that Affability and Complai&s;ance they u&s;e in &s;hewing the Rarities of their &s;everal Cells;
<PB N="221" REF="228">
where, for fear you &s;hould &s;lip any thing worthy Ob&s;ervation, they endeavour to in|&s;til in you as quick a Propen&s;ity of asking, as you find in them a prompt Alacrity in an&s;wering &s;uch Que&s;tions of Curio&s;ity as their own have in&s;pir'd.</P>
<P>IN particular, I remember one of tho&s;e reverend old Men, when we were taking Leave at the Door of his Cell, to which out of his great Civility he accompany'd us, finding by the Air of our Faces, as well as our Expre&s;&s;ions, that we thought our &s;elves plea&s;ingly entertain'd; to divert us afre&s;h, advanc'd a few Paces from the Door, when giving a Whi&s;tle with his Mouth, a &s;ur|prizing Flock of pretty little Birds, varie|gated, and of different Colours, immediate|ly flock'd around him. Here you &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome alighting upon his Shoulders, &s;ome on his awful Beard; others took Refuge on his &s;now-like Head, and many feeding, and more endeavouring to feed out of his Mouth; each appearing emulous and under an inno|cent Contention, how be&s;t to expre&s;s their Love and Re&s;pect to their no le&s;s plea&s;ed Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>NOR did the other Cells labour under any Deficiency of Variety: Every one boa&s;ting in &s;ome particular, that might di&s;tingui&s;h it in &s;omething equally agreeable and enter|taining. Neverthele&s;s, cry&s;tal Springs &s;pouting from the &s;olid Rocks were, from
<PB N="222" REF="229">
the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, common to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> all; and, in mo&s;t of them, they had littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> bra&s;s Cocks, out of which, when turn'd, i&s;&s;u'd the mo&s;t cool and cry&s;talline Flows o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> excellent pure Water. And yet what more affected me, and which I found near more Cells than one, was the natural Ca&s;cades of the &s;ame tran&s;parent Element; the&s;e falling from one Rock to another, in that warm, or rather hot Climate, gave not more delightful A&s;toni&s;hment to the Eye, than they afforded grateful Refre&s;hment to the whole Man. The Streams falling from the&s;e, &s;often, from a rougher tumultuous Noi&s;e, into &s;uch affecting Murmurs, by Di&s;tance, the Intervention of Groves, or neighbouring Rocks, that it were impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee or hear them and not be charm'd.</P>
<P>NEITHER are tho&s;e Groves grateful only in a beautiful Verdure; Nature renders them otherwi&s;e delightful, in loading them with Clu&s;ters of Berries of a perfect &s;carlet Co|lour, which, by a beautiful Intermixture, &s;trike the Eye with additional Delight. In &s;hort, it might nonplus a Per&s;on of the nice&s;t Ta&s;te, to di&s;tingui&s;h or determine, whether the Neatne&s;s of their Cells within, or the beauteous Varieties without, mo&s;t exhau&s;t his Admiration. Nor is the Whole, in my Opinion, a little advantag'd by the frequent View of &s;ome of tho&s;e pyramidical Pillars, which &s;eem, as weary of their own
<PB N="223" REF="230">
Weight, to recline and &s;eek Support from others in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>WHEN I mention'd the out&s;ide Beauties of their Cells, I mu&s;t be thought to have for|got to particularize the glorious Pro&s;pects pre&s;ented to your Eye from every one of them; but e&s;pecially from that neare&s;t the Summit. A Pro&s;pect, by rea&s;on of the Purity of the Air, &s;o exten&s;ive, and &s;o very entertaining, that to dilate upon it properly to one that never &s;aw it, would baffle Cre|dit; and naturally to depaint it, would confound Invention. I therefore &s;hall only &s;ay, that on the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Side, after an agreeable Interval of &s;ome fair Leagues, it will &s;et at defiance the &s;tronge&s;t Opticks; and although <HI>Barcelona</HI> bounds it on the Land, the Eyes are fea&s;ted with the De|lights of &s;uch an intervening Champion (where beauteous Nature does not only &s;mile, but riot) that the Sen&s;e mu&s;t be very temperate, or very weak, that can be &s;oon or ea&s;ily &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>HAVING thus taken a View of all their refre&s;hing Springs, their grateful Groves, and &s;olitary Shades under &s;ingle Trees, who&s;e Clu&s;ters prov'd that even Rocks were grown fruitful; and having ran over all the Variety of Plea&s;ures in their &s;everal pretty Cells, decently &s;et off with Gardens round them, equally fragrant and beautiful, we were brought down again to the Con|vent,

which, though on a &s;mall A&s;cent, lies very near the Foot of this terre&s;trial Pa|radi&s;e, there to take a Survey of their &s;umptuous Hall, much more &s;umptuous Chapel, and its adjoining Repo&s;itory; and fea&s;t our Eyes with Wonders of a dif|ferent Nature; and yet as entertaining as any, or all, we had &s;een before.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on our De&s;cent, a Prie&s;t pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the Door of the Con|vent, ready to &s;hew us the hidden Rarities. And though, as I under&s;tood, hardly a Day pa&s;&s;es without the Re&s;ort of &s;ome Strangers to gratify their Curio&s;ity with the Wonders of the Place; yet is there, on every &s;uch Occa&s;ion, a &s;uperior Concour&s;e of Natives ready to &s;ee over again, out of meer Bigo|try and Super&s;tition, what they have &s;een, perhaps, a hundred times before. I could not avoid taking notice, however, that the Prie&s;t treated tho&s;e con&s;tant Vi&s;itants with much le&s;s Ceremony, or more Freedom, if you plea&s;e, than any of the Strangers of what Nation &s;oever; or, indeed, he &s;eem'd to take as much Pains to di&s;oblige tho&s;e, as he did Plea&s;ure in obliging us.</P>
<P>THE Hall was neat, large and &s;tately; but being plain and unadorn'd with more than decent Decorations, &s;uitable to &s;uch a Society, I ha&s;ten to the other.</P>
<P>WHEN we enter'd the Chapel, our Eyes were immediately attracted by the
<PB N="225" REF="232">
Image of our Lady of <HI>Mont&s;erat</HI> (as they call it) which &s;tands over the Altar-Piece. It is about the natural Stature; but as black and &s;hining as Ebony it &s;elf. Mo&s;t would imagine it made of that Material; though her Retinue and Adorers will allow nothing of the Matter. On the contrary, Tradi|tion, which with them is, on &s;ome Occa|&s;ions, more than tantamount to Religion, has a&s;&s;ur'd them, and they relate it as un|doubted Matter of Fact, that her pre&s;ent Colour, if I may &s;o call it, proceeded from her Concealment, in the Time of the <HI>Moors,</HI> between tho&s;e two Rocks on which the Chapel is founded; and that her long lying in that di&s;mal Place chang'd her once love|ly White into its pre&s;ent oppo&s;ite. Would not a Heretick here be apt to &s;ay, That it was great pity that an Image which &s;till boa&s;ts the Power of acting &s;o many Miracles, could no better con&s;erve her own Com|plexion? At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be allow'd, even by a good Catholick, to carry along with it Matter of Reproach to the fair Ladies, Natives of the Country, for their unnatural and exce&s;&s;ive Affection of adulterating, if not defacing, their beautiful Faces, with the ruinating Dauberies of <HI>Carmine?</HI></P>
<P>AS the Cu&s;tom of the Place is (which is likewi&s;e allow'd to be a di&s;tingui&s;hing Piece of Civility to Strangers) when we approach the black Lady (who, I &s;hould have told
<PB N="226" REF="233">
you, bears a Child in her Arms; but whe|ther maternally Black, or of the <HI>Mulatto</HI> Kind, I prote&s;t I did not mind) the Prie&s;t, in great Civility, offers you her Arm to &s;a|lute; at which Juncture, I, like a true blue Prote&s;tant, mi&s;taking my Word of Com|mand, fell foul on the fair Lady's Face. The Di&s;plea&s;ure in his Countenance (for he took more Notice of the Rudene&s;s than the good Lady her &s;elf) &s;oon convinc'd me of my Error: However, as a greater Token of his Civility, having admitted no <HI>Spa|niards</HI> along with my Companions and me, it pa&s;s'd off the better; and his after Civi|lities manife&s;ted, that he was willing to re|form my Ignorance by his Complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>TO demon&s;trate which, upon my telling him that I had a Set of Beads, which I mu&s;t entreat him to con&s;ecrate for me, he readily, nay eagerly comply'd; and having hung them on her Arm for the Space of about half, or &s;omewhat &s;hort of a whole Minute, he return'd me the holy Baubles with a great deal of Addre&s;s and mo&s;t evi|dent Satisfaction. The Reader will be apt to admire at this curious Piece of Super&s;ti|tion of mine, till I have told him, that even rigid Prote&s;tants have, in this Country<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought it but prudent to do the like; and likewi&s;e having &s;o done, to carry them a|bout their Per&s;ons, or in their Pockets: For Experience has convinc'd us of the Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="227" REF="234">
of this mo&s;t Catholick Precaution; &s;ince tho&s;e who have here, travelling or other|wi&s;e, come to their Ends, whether by Ac|cident, Sickne&s;s, or the Cour&s;e of Nature, not having the&s;e &s;anctifying Seals found up|on them, have ever been refus'd Chri&s;tian Burial, under a &s;uper&s;titious Imagination, that the Corps of a Heretick will infect every thing near it.</P>
<P>TWO In&s;tances of this kind fell within my Knowledge; one before I came to <HI>Mont&s;erat,</HI> the other after. The fir&s;t was of one <HI>Slunt,</HI> who had been <HI>Bombardier</HI> at <HI>Monjouick</HI>; but being kill'd while we lay at <HI>Campilio,</HI> a Prie&s;t, whom I advis'd with upon the Matter, told me, that if he &s;hould be buried where any Corn grew, his Body would not only be taken up again, but ill treated, in revenge of the De&s;truction of &s;o much Corn, which the People would on no account be per&s;uaded to touch; for which Rea&s;on we took care to have him lay'd in a very deep Grave, on a very barren Spot of Ground. The other was of one Captain <HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> who was a Pri&s;oner with me on the Surrender of <HI>Denia</HI>; who being &s;ent, as I was afterwards, to Saint <HI>Clemente la Mancha,</HI> there dy'd; and, as I was inform'd, tho' he was private|ly, and by Night, bury'd in a Corn-Field, he was taken out of his Grave by tho&s;e &s;uper|&s;titious People, as &s;oon as ever they could di&s;cover the Place where his Body was de|po&s;ited.
<PB N="228" REF="235">
But I return to the Convent at <HI>Mont&s;erat.</HI></P>
<P>OUT of the Chapel, behind the High-Altar, we de&s;cended into a &s;pacious Room, the Repo&s;itory of the great Offerings made to the Lady. Here, though I thought in the Chapel it &s;elf I had &s;een the Riches of the Univer&s;e, I found a prodigious Quan|tity of more co&s;tly Pre&s;ents, the &s;uper&s;ti|tious Tribute of mo&s;t of the Roman-Catho|lick Princes in <HI>Europe.</HI> Among a Multi|tude of others, they &s;how'd me a Sword &s;et with Diamonds, the Offering of <HI>Charles</HI> the Third, then King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but now Emperor of <HI>Germany.</HI> Though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, being a Heretick, I could much ea&s;ier find a Rea&s;on for a fair Lady's pre|&s;enting &s;uch a Sword to a King of <HI>Spain,</HI> than for a King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s pre&s;enting &s;uch a Sword to a fair Lady: And by the Motto upon it, <HI>Pulchra tamen nigra,</HI> it was plain &s;uch was his Opinion. That Prince was &s;o delighted with the Plea&s;ures of this &s;weet Place, that he, as well as I, &s;tay'd as long as ever he could; though neither of us &s;o long as either could have wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>BUT there was another Offering from a King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> equally glorious and co&s;tly; but much better adapted; and therefore in its Propriety ea&s;ier to be ac|counted for. That was a Glory for the Head of her Ladi&s;hip, every Ray of which
<PB N="229" REF="236">
was &s;et with Diamonds, large at the Bot|tom, and gradually le&s;&s;ening to the very Extremity of every Ray. Each Ray might be about half a Yard long; and I imagin'd in the Whole there might be about one Hundred of them. In &s;hort, if ever her Ladi&s;hip did the Offerer the Honour to put it on, I will, though a Heretick, venture to aver, &s;he did not at that pre&s;ent time look like a humane Creature.</P>
<P>TO enumerate the re&s;t, if my Memory would &s;uffice, would exceed Belief. As the upper Part was a plain Miracle of Nature, the lower was a compleat Trea&s;ury of mira|culous Art.</P>
<P>IF you a&s;cend from the lowe&s;t Cell to the very Summit, the la&s;t of all the thirteen, you will perceive a continual Contention between Plea&s;ure and Devotion; and at la&s;t, perhaps, find your &s;elf at a Lo&s;s to decide which de&s;erves the Preheminence: For you are not here to take Cells in the vulgar Ac|ceptation, as the little Dormitories of &s;oli|tary Monks: No! Neatne&s;s, U&s;e, and Contrivance appear in every one of them; and though in an almo&s;t perfect Equality, yet in &s;uch Perfection, that you will find it difficult to di&s;cover in any one of them any thing wanting to the Plea&s;ure of Life.</P>
<P>IF you de&s;cend to the Convent near the Foot of that venerable Hill; you may &s;ee more, much more of the Riches of the
<PB N="230" REF="237">
World; but le&s;s, far le&s;s Appearance of a cele&s;tial Trea&s;ure. Perhaps, it might be only the Sentiment of a Heretick; but that Awe and Devotion, which I found in my Attendant from Cell to Cell grew languid, and lo&s;t in meer empty Bigotry and foggy Super&s;tition, when I came below. In &s;hort, there was not a greater Difference in their Heights, than in the Sentiments they in|&s;pir'd me with.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this Emblem of the bea|tifick Vi&s;ion, I mu&s;t correct &s;ome thing like a Mi&s;take, as to the poor <HI>Borigo.</HI> I &s;aid at the Beginning that his Labour was daily; but the <HI>Sunday</HI> is to him a Day of re&s;t, as it is to the Hermits, his Ma&s;ters, a Day of Refection. For to &s;ave the poor faithful Brute the hard Drudgery of that Day, the thirteen Hermits, if Health per|mit, de&s;cend to their <HI>Coenobium,</HI> as they call it; that is, to the Hall of the Convent; where they dine in common with the Monks of the Order, who are <HI>Benedictines.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER &s;even Days Variety of &s;uch in|nocent Delight (the Space allow'd for the Entertainment of Strangers) I took my Leave of this pacifick Hermitage, to pur&s;ue the more boi&s;terous Duties of my Calling. The Life of a Soldier is in every Re&s;pect the full <HI>Antithe&s;is</HI> to that of a Hermit; and I know not, whether it might not be a Sen&s;e of that, which in&s;pir'd me with very great
<PB N="231" REF="238">
Reluctancy at parting. I confe&s;s, while on the Spot, I over and over bandy'd in my Mind the Rea&s;ons which might prevail upon <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth to relinqui&s;h his Crown; and the Arguments on his Side never fail'd of Energy, when I could per|&s;uade my &s;elf that this, or &s;ome like happy Retreat, was the Reward of abdicated Em|pire.</P>
<P>FULL of the&s;e Contemplations (for they la&s;ted there) I arriv'd at <HI>Barcelona</HI>; where I found a Ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;ail, on which I embark'd for <HI>Denia,</HI> in pur&s;uance of my Orders. Sailing to the Mouth of the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI> no Place along the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Shore affords a Pro&s;pect equally delightful with the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Denia.</HI> It was never de&s;ign'd for a Place of great Strength, be|ing built, and fir&s;t de&s;ign'd, as a Seat of Plea&s;ure to the Great Duke of <HI>Lerma.</HI> In that Family it many Years remain'd; tho', within le&s;s than a Century, that with two other Dukedoms, have devolv'd upon the Family of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the riche&s;t Subject at this time in all <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DENIA</HI> was the fir&s;t Town, that, in our Way to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> declar'd for King <HI>Charles</HI>; and was then by his Order made a Garri&s;on. The Town is but &s;mall, and &s;urrounded with a thin Wall; &s;o thin, that I have known a Cannon-Ball pierce through it at once.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">WHEN I arriv'd at <HI>Denia,</HI> I found a <HI>Spaniard</HI> Governor of the Town, who&s;e Name has &s;lipt my Memory; tho' his Be|haviour merited everla&s;ting Annals. Major <HI>Percival,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> commanded in the Ca&s;tle, and on my coming there, I un|der&s;tood, it had been agreed between 'em, that in ca&s;e of a Siege, which they appre|hended, the Town &s;hould be defended wholly by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I had &s;carce been there three Weeks be|fore tho&s;e Expectations were an&s;wered. The Place was inve&s;ted by Count <HI>D' Alfelt,</HI> and Major General <HI>Mahoni</HI>; two Days after which, they open'd Trenches on the Ea&s;t Side of the Town. I was nece&s;&s;itated upon their &s;o doing, to order the Demoli&s;hment of &s;ome Hou&s;es on that Side, that I might erect a Battery to point upon their Trenches, the better to annoy them. I did &s;o; and it did the intended Service; for with that, and two others, which I rais'd upon the Ca&s;tle (from all which we fir'd ince&s;&s;antly, and with great Succe&s;s) the Be&s;iegers were &s;ufficiently incommoded.</P>
<P>THE Governor of the Town (a <HI>Spaniard</HI> as I &s;aid before, and with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri|&s;on) behav'd very gallantly; in&s;omuch, that what was &s;aid of the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> when he &s;o bravely defended <HI>Gibraltar</HI> again&s;t the joint Forces of <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="233" REF="240">
<HI>Spain,</HI> might be &s;aid of him, that he was Governor, Engineer, Gunner, and Bom|bardier all in one: For no Man could ex|ceed him, either in Conduct or Courage; nor were the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under him le&s;s va|liant or vigilant: For in ca&s;e the Place was taken, expecting but indifferent Quarter, they fought with Bravery, and defended the Place to Admiration.</P>
<P>THE Enemy had an&s;wer'd our Fire with all the Ardour imaginable; and having made a Breach, that, as we thought was practicable, a Storm was expected every Hour. Preparing again&s;t which, to the great Joy of all the Inhabitants, and the Surprize of the whole Garri&s;on, and with|out our being able to a&s;&s;ign the lea&s;t Cau&s;e, the Enemy &s;uddenly rai&s;ed the Siege, and withdrew from a Place, which tho&s;e within imagined in great Danger.</P>
<P>THE Siege thus abdicated (if I may u&s;e a modern Phra&s;e) I was re&s;olved to im|prove my Time, and make the be&s;t Provi&s;i|on I could again&s;t any future Attack. To that purpo&s;e I made &s;everal new Fortificati|ons, together with proper Ca&s;emets for our Powder, all which render'd the Place much &s;tronger, tho' Time too &s;oon &s;how'd me that Strength it &s;elf mu&s;t yield to For|tune.</P>
<P>SURVEYING tho&s;e Works, and my Work|men, I was one Day &s;tanding on the great
<PB N="234" REF="241">
Battery, when ca&s;ting my Eye toward the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coa&s;t, I ob&s;erv'd an odd &s;ort of greeni&s;h Cloud making to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Shoar. Not like other Clouds with Rapi|dity or Swiftne&s;s; but with a Motion &s;o &s;low, that Sight it&s;elf was a long time be|fore it would allow it &s;uch. At la&s;t, it came ju&s;t over my Head, and interpo&s;ing between the Sun and me, &s;o thickned the Air, that I had lo&s;t the very Sight of Day. At this moment it had reach'd the Land; and tho' very near me in my Imagination, it began to di&s;&s;olve, and lo&s;e of its fir&s;t Te|nebrity, when all on a &s;udden there fell &s;uch a va&s;t multitude of Locu&s;ts, as exceed|ed the thicke&s;t &s;torm of Hail or Snow that I ever &s;aw. All around me was immediately cover'd with tho&s;e crauling Creatures; and they yet continu'd to fall &s;o thick, that with the &s;wing of my Cane I knock'd down thou&s;ands. It is &s;carce imaginable the Ha|vock I made in a very little &s;pace of time; much le&s;s conceivable is the horrid De&s;ola|tion which attended the Vi&s;itation of tho&s;e <HI>Animalcula.</HI> There was not in a Day or two's time, the lea&s;t Leaf to be &s;een upon a Tree, nor any green Thing in a Garden. Nature &s;eem'd buried in her own Ruins; and the vegetable World to be Supporters only to her Monument. I never &s;aw the harde&s;t Winter, in tho&s;e Parts, attended with any equal De&s;olation. When, glut|ton
<PB N="235" REF="242">
like, they had devour'd all that &s;hould have &s;u&s;tained them, and the more valuable Part of God's Creation (whether weary with gorging, or over thir&s;ty with devour|ing, I leave to Philo&s;ophers) they made to Ponds, Brooks, and &s;tanding Pools, there revenging their own Rape upon Nature, up|on their own vile Carka&s;&s;es. In every of the&s;e you might &s;ee them lie in Heaps like little Hills; drown'd indeed, but attended with Stenches &s;o noi&s;ome, that it gave the di&s;tracted Neighbourhood too great Rea&s;on to apprehend yet more fatal Con&s;equences. A Pe&s;tilential Infection is the Dread of every Place, but e&s;pecially of all Parts upon the <HI>Me|diterranean.</HI> The Prie&s;ts therefore repair'd to a little Chapel, built in the open Fields, to be made u&s;e of on &s;uch like Occa&s;ions, there to deprecate the mi&s;erable Cau&s;e of this dreadful Vi&s;itation. In a Week's time, or there abouts, the Stench was over, and every Thing but verdant Nature in its pri&s;tin Order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Denia</HI> be|&s;ieged a|gain and taken.</NOTE>SOME few Months after this, and about eight Months from the former Siege, Count <HI>D' Alfelt</HI> caus'd <HI>Denia</HI> to be again inve&s;t|ed; and being then &s;en&s;ible of all the Mi&s;takes he had before committed, he now went about his Bu&s;ine&s;s with more Regularity and Di&s;|cretion. The fir&s;t Thing he &s;et upon, and it was the wi&s;e&s;t Thing he could do, was to cut off our Communication with the Sea.
<PB N="236" REF="243">
This he did, and thereby obtained what he much de&s;ired. Next, he caus'd his Bat|teries to be erected on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Town, from which he ply'd it &s;o furiou&s;ly, that in five Days time a practicable Breach was made; upon which they &s;torm'd and took it. The Governor, who had &s;o brave|ly defended it in the former Seige, fortu|nately for him, had been remov'd; and <HI>Francis Valero,</HI> now in his Place, was made Pri&s;oner of War with all his Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>AFTER the taking the Town, they erect|ed Batteries again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, which they kept ply'd with ince&s;&s;ant Fire, both from Cannon and Mortars. But what mo&s;t of all plagu'd us, and did us mo&s;t Mi&s;chief, was the va&s;t &s;howers of Stones &s;ent among the Garri&s;on from their Mortars. The&s;e, ter|rible in Bulk and Size, did more Execution than all the re&s;t put together. The Gar|ri&s;on could not avoid being &s;omewhat di&s;|heartened at this uncommon way of Ren|counter; yet, to a Man, declar'd again&s;t hearkening to any Propo&s;als of Surrender, the Governor excepted; who having &s;elect|ed more Trea&s;ure than he could properly, or ju&s;tly call his own, was the only Per&s;on that &s;eem'd forward for &s;uch a Motion. He had more than once thrown out Expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch a Nature, but without any Effect. Neverthele&s;s, having at la&s;t &s;ecretly obtain|ed a peculiar Capitulation for him&s;elf, Bag,
<PB N="237" REF="244">
and Baggage; the Garri&s;on was &s;acrific'd to his private Intere&s;t, and ba&s;ely given up Pri&s;oners of War. By the&s;e Means indeed he &s;aved his Money, but lo&s;t his Reputati|on; and &s;oon after, Life it &s;elf. And &s;ure every Body will allow the latter lo&s;s to be lea&s;t, who will take Pains to con&s;ider, that it &s;creen'd him from the con&s;equential Scrutinies of a Council of War, which mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued as the ju&s;t Reward of his Deme|rits.</P>
<P>THE Garri&s;on being thus unaccountably de|livered up and made Pri&s;oners, were di&s;per&s;|ed different Ways: Some into <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> others as far as <HI>Oviedo,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Leon.</HI> For my own part, having received a Contu|&s;ion in my Brea&s;t; I was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being left behind with the Enemy, till I &s;hould be in a Condition to be re|mov'd, and when that time came, I found my &s;elf agreeably order'd to <HI>Valencia.</HI></P>
<P>AS a Pri&s;oner of War I mu&s;t now bid a|dieu to the active Part of the military Life; and hereafter concern my &s;elf with De&s;crip|tions of Countries, Towns, Palaces, and Men, in&s;tead of Battles. However, if I take in my way Actions of War, founded on the be&s;t Authorities, I hope my Inter&s;per|&s;ing &s;uch will be no di&s;advantage to my now more pacifick MEMOIRS.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon as I arriv'd at <HI>Valencia,</HI> I wrote to our Pay-ma&s;ter Mr. <HI>Mead,</HI> at <HI>Barcelona,</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="245">
letting him know, that I was become a Pri&s;oner, wounded, and in want of Money. Nor could even all tho&s;e Circum&s;tances prevail on me to think it long before he re|turned a favourable An&s;wer, in an Order to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Zoulicafre,</HI> a Banker, to pay me on Sight fifty Pi&s;toles. But in the &s;ame Let|ter he gave me to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e fifty Pi&s;toles were a Pre&s;ent to me from Ge|neral (afterwards Earl) <HI>Stanhope</HI>; and &s;o indeed I found it, when I return'd into <HI>England,</HI> my Account not being charged with any part of it: But this was not the only Te&s;t I received of that generous Earl's Genero&s;ity. And where's the Wonder, as the World is compell'd to own, that Hero|ick Actions and Largene&s;s of Soul ever did di&s;cover and amply di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine Branches of that illu&s;trious Family.</P>
<P>THIS Recruit to me however was the more generous for being &s;ea&s;onable. Bene|fits are always doubled in their being ea&s;ily conferr'd and well tim'd; and with &s;uch an Allowance as I con&s;tantly had by the order of King <HI>Philip,</HI> as Pri&s;oner of War, <HI>viz.</HI> eighteen Ounces of Mutton <HI>per diem</HI> for my &s;elf, and nine for my Man, with Bread and Wine in proportion, and e&s;pecially in &s;uch a Situation; all this I &s;ay was &s;ufficient to invite a Man to be ea&s;y, and almo&s;t for|get his want of Liberty, and much more &s;o to me, if it be con&s;ider'd, that, that want
<PB N="239" REF="246">
of Liberty con&s;i&s;ted only in being debarr'd from leaving the plea&s;ante&s;t City in all <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I met with the <HI>French</HI> Engineer, who made the Mine under the Rock of the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Alicant.</HI> That fatal Mine, which blew up General <HI>Richards,</HI> Colonel <HI>Sy|burg,</HI> Colonel <HI>Thornicroft,</HI> and at lea&s;t twenty more Officers. And yet by the Ac|count, that Engineer gave me, their Fate was their own choo&s;ing: The General, who commanded at that Siege being more indu&s;trious to &s;ave them, than they were to be &s;av'd: He endeavour'd it many ways: He &s;ent them word of the Mine, and their readine&s;s to &s;pring it; he over and over &s;ent them Offers of Leave to come, and take a view of it, and in&s;pect it: Notwith|&s;tanding all which, tho' Colonel <HI>Thorni|croft,</HI> and Captain <HI>Page,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Engi|neer, in the Service of Kng <HI>Charles,</HI> pur|&s;ued the Invitation, and were permitted to view it, yet would they not believe; but reported on their Return, that it was a &s;ham Mine, a feint only to intimidate 'em to a Surrender, all the Bags being fill'd with Sand in&s;tead of Gunpowder.</P>
<P>THE very Day on which the Be&s;iegers de&s;ign'd to &s;pring the Mine, they gave No|tice of it; and the People of the Neigh|bourhood ran up in Crowds to an oppo&s;ite Hill in order to &s;ee it: Neverthele&s;s, altho'
<PB N="240" REF="247">
tho&s;e in the Ca&s;tle &s;aw all this, they &s;till remain'd &s;o infatuated, as to imagine it all done only to affright 'em. At length the fatal Mine was &s;prung, and all who were upon that Battery lo&s;t their Lives; and a|mong them tho&s;e I fir&s;t mentioned. The very Recital hereof made me think within my &s;elf, <HI>who can re&s;i&s;t his Fate?</HI></P>
<P>THAT Engineer added further, that it was with an incredible Difficulty, that he prepar'd that Mine; that there were in the Concavity thirteen hundred Barrels of Powder; notwith&s;tanding which, it made no great Noi&s;e without, whatever it might do inwardly; that only taking away what might be not improperly term'd an Excre|&s;cence in the Rock, the Heave on the Bla&s;t had render'd the Ca&s;tle rather &s;tronger on that Side than it was before, a Cre|vice or Crack which had often occa&s;ioned Apprehen&s;ions being thereby wholly clos'd and firm.</P>
<P>SOME further Particulars I &s;oon after had from Colonel <HI>Syburg's</HI> Gentleman; who &s;eeing me at the Play-hou&s;e, chal|lenged me, tho' at that Time unknown to me. He told me, that the Night pre|ceeding the unfortunate Cata&s;trophe of his Ma&s;ter, he was waiting on him in the Ca&s;emet, where he ob&s;erved, &s;ometime before the re&s;t of the Company took notice of it, that General <HI>Richards</HI> appeared
<PB N="241" REF="248">
very pen&s;ive and thoughtful, that the whole Night long he was pe&s;ter'd with, and could not get rid of a great Flie, which was per|petually buzzing about his Ears and Head, to the vexation and di&s;turbance of the re&s;t of the Company, as well as the General him&s;elf; that in the Morning, when they went upon the Battery, under which the Mine was, the General made many offers of going off; but Colonel <HI>Syburg,</HI> who was got a little merry, and the re&s;t out of a Bravado, would &s;tay, and would not let the General &s;tir; that at la&s;t it was pro|pos'd by Colonel <HI>Syburg</HI> to have the other two Bottles to the Queen's Health, after which he promi&s;ed they would all go off together.</P>
<P>UPON this my Relator, <HI>Syburg</HI>'s Gentle|man, &s;aid, he was &s;ent to fetch the &s;tipula|ted two Bottles; returning with which, Captain <HI>Daniel Weaver,</HI> within thirty or forty Yards of the Battery, ran by him, vowing, he was re&s;olv'd to drink the Queen's Health with them; but his Feet were &s;carce on the Battery, when the Mine was &s;prung, which took him away with the re&s;t of the Company; while Major <HI>Harding</HI> now a Ju&s;tice in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> com|ing that very Moment off Duty, exchang'd Fates.</P>
<P>IF Prede&s;tination, in the Eyes of many, is an unaccountable Doctrine, what better
<PB N="242" REF="249">
Account can the wi&s;e&s;t give of this Fatality? Or to what el&s;e &s;hall we impute the I&s;&s;ue of this whole Tran&s;action? That Men &s;hall be &s;olicited to their Safety; &s;uffered to &s;ur|vey the Danger they were threatened with; among many other Tokens of its approach|ing Certainty, &s;ee &s;uch a Concour&s;e of Peo|ple crowding to be Spectators of their im|pending Cata&s;trophe; and after all this, &s;o infatuated to &s;tay on the fatal Spot the fetching up of the other two Bottles; what|ever it may to &s;uch as never think, to &s;uch as plead an u&s;e of Rea&s;on, it mu&s;t admini|&s;ter Matter worthy of the &s;edate&s;t Con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>BEING now pretty well recover'd of my Wounds, I was by Order of the Governor of <HI>Valencia,</HI> removed to <HI>Sainte Clemente de la Mancha,</HI> a Town &s;omewhat more Inland, and con&s;equently e&s;teem'd more &s;ecure than a Semi-Seaport. Here I remain'd under a &s;ort of Pilgrimage upwards of three Years. To me as a Stranger dive&s;ted of Acquain|tance or Friend (for at that in&s;tant I was &s;ole Pri&s;oner there) at fir&s;t it appear'd &s;uch, tho' in a very &s;mall compa&s;s of Time, I luckily found it made quite otherwi&s;e by an agreeable Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>SAINTE Clemente de la Mancha,</HI> is rendered famous by the renown'd <HI>Don Michael Cerviantes,</HI> who in his facetious but &s;atyrical Romance, has fix'd it the
<PB N="243" REF="250">
Seat and Birth Place of his Hero <HI>Don Quixot.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentlemen of this Place are the lea&s;t Prie&s;t-ridden or Sons of Bigotry, of any that I met with in all <HI>Spain</HI>; of which in my Conver&s;ation with them I had daily In&s;tances. Among many others, an Expre&s;&s;ion that fell from <HI>Don Felix Pacheco,</HI> a Gentle|man of the be&s;t Figure thereabout, and of a very plentiful Fortune, &s;hall now &s;uffice. I was become very intimate with him; and we us'd often to conver&s;e together with a Freedom too dangerous to be common in a Country &s;o en&s;lav'd by the Inqui&s;ition. Asking me one Day in a &s;ort of a joco&s;e manner, who, in my Opinion, had done the greate&s;t Miracles that ever were heard of? I an&s;wer'd, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
<Q REND="inline">"It is very true, &s;ays he, Je&s;us Chri&s;t did great Mi|racles, and a great one it was to feed five Thou&s;and People with two or three &s;mall Fi&s;hes, and a like number of Loaves: But <HI>Saint Francis,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Order, has found out a way to feed daily one hundred Thou&s;and Lub|bards with nothing at all;"</Q> meaning the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> the Followers of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> who have no vi&s;ible Revenues; yet in their way of Living come up to, if they do not exceed any other Order.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Day talking of the Place, it naturally led us into a Di&s;cour&s;e of the
<PB N="244" REF="251">
Knight of <HI>la Mancha, Don Quixot.</HI> At which time he told me, that in his Opinion, that Work was a perfect Paradox, being the be&s;t and the wor&s;t Romance, that ever was wrote.
<Q REND="inline">"For, &s;ays he, tho' it mu&s;t infallibly plea&s;e every Man, that has any ta&s;te of Wit; yet has it had &s;uch a fatal Effect upon the Spirits of my Country|men, that every Man of Wit mu&s;t ever re&s;ent; for, continu'd he, before the Ap|pearance in the World of that Labour of <HI>Cerviantes,</HI> it was next to an Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity for a Man to walk the Streets with any Delight, or without Danger. There were &s;een &s;o many Cavaliero's prancing and curvetting before the Windows of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that a Stranger would have imagin'd the whole Nation to have been nothing le&s;s than a Race of Knight Errants. But after the World became a little acquainted with that no|table Hi&s;tory; the Man that was &s;een in that once celebrated Drapery, was pointed at as a <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> and found him&s;elf the Je&s;t of High and Low. And I verily believe, added he, that to this, and this only we owe that dampne&s;s and poverty of Spirit, which has run thro' all our Councils for a Century pa&s;t, &s;o little agreeable to tho&s;e nobler Actions of our famous Ance&s;tors."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252">AFTER many of the&s;e le&s;&s;er &s;orts of Con|fidences, <HI>Don Felix</HI> recommended me to a Lodging next Door to his own. It was at a Widow's, who had one only Daughter, her Hou&s;e ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Nunnery. Here I remain'd &s;omewhat up|wards of two Years; all which time, lying in my Bed, I could hear the Nuns early in the Morning at their <HI>Matins,</HI> and late in the Evening at their <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> with Delight enough to my &s;elf, and without the lea&s;t Indecency in the World in my Thoughts of them. Their own Divine Employ too much employ'd every Faculty of mine to entertain any Thing incon&s;entaneous or offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THIS my Neighbourhood to the Nunnery gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing two Nuns inve&s;ted; and in this I mu&s;t do a Ju&s;tice to the whole Country, to acknowledge, that a Stranger who is curious (I would impute it rather to their hopes of Conver&s;ion, than to their Vanity) &s;hall be admitted to much greater Freedoms in their religious Pagean|tries, than any Native.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of In|ve&s;ting Nuns.</NOTE>ONE of the&s;e Nuns was of the fir&s;t Quali|ty, which render'd the Ceremony more re|markably fine. The manner of inve&s;ting them was thus: In the Morning her Relations and Friends all met at her Father's Hou&s;e; whence, &s;he being attir'd in her mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous Apparel, and a Coronet plac'd on her Head, they attended her, in Cavalcade, to
<PB N="246" REF="253">
the Nunnery, the Streets and Windows be|ing crowded, and fill'd with Spectators of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon as &s;he enter'd the Chapel belong|ing to the Nunnery, &s;he kneel'd down, and with an appearance of much Devotion, &s;a|luted the Ground; then ri&s;ing up, &s;he ad|vanced a Step or two farther; when on her Knees &s;he repeated the Salutes: This done &s;he approached to the Altar, where &s;he remain|ed till Ma&s;s was over: After which, a Ser|mon was preach'd by one of the Prie&s;ts in Prai&s;e, or rather in an exalted Preference of a &s;ingle Life. The Sermon being over, the Nun elect fell down on her Knees before the Altar; and after &s;ome &s;hort mental Orai|&s;ons, ri&s;ing again, &s;he withdrew into an in|ner Room, where &s;tripping off all her rich Attire, &s;he put on her Nun's Weeds: In which making her Appearance, &s;he, again kneeling, offer'd up &s;ome private Devotions; which being over, &s;he was led to the Door of the Nunnery, where the Lady and the re&s;t of the Nuns &s;tood ready to receive her with open Arms. Thus enter'd, the Nuns conducted her into the Quire, where after they had entertained her with Singing, and playing upon the Organ, the Ceremony concluded, and every one departed to their proper Habitations.</P>
<P>THE very &s;ame Day of the Year en&s;uing, the Relations and Friends of the fair Novi|tiate
<PB N="247" REF="254">
meet again in the Chapel of the Nun|nery, where the Lady Abbe&s;s brings her out, and delivers her to them. Then again is there a Sermon preach'd on the &s;ame Subject as at fir&s;t; which being over, &s;he is brought up to the Altar in a decent, but plain Dre&s;s, the fine Apparel, which &s;he put off on her Initiation, being depo&s;ited on one &s;ide of the Altar, and her Nun's Weeds on the other. Here the Prie&s;t in Latin cries, <HI>Utrum horum mavis, accipe</HI>: to which &s;he an&s;wers, as her Inclination, or as her In&s;truction directs her. If &s;he, after this her Year of Probation, &s;how any Di&s;like, &s;he is at Liberty to come again into the World: But if aw'd by Fear (as too often is the Ca&s;e) or won by Ex|pectation, or pre&s;ent real Inclination, &s;he makes choice of the Nun's Weeds, &s;he is im|mediately inve&s;ted, and mu&s;t never expect to appear again in the World out of the Walls of the Nunnery. The young Lady I thus &s;aw inve&s;ted was very beautiful, and &s;ang the be&s;t of any in the Nunnery.</P>
<P>THERE are in the Town three Nunneries, and a Convent to every one of them; <HI>viz.</HI> one of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> one of <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and the other of <HI>Franci&s;cans.</HI> Let me not be &s;o far mi&s;taken to have this taken by way of Reflection. No! Whatever &s;ome of our Rakes of the Town may a&s;&s;ert, I freely de|clare, that I never &s;aw in any of the Nun|neries (of which I have &s;een many both in
<PB N="248" REF="255">
<HI>Spain</HI> and other Parts of the World) any thing like indecent Behaviour, that might give occa&s;ion for Satyr or Di&s;e&s;teem. It is true, there may be Accidents, that may lead to a Mi&s;interpretation; of which I re|member a very untoward In&s;tance in <HI>Ali|cant.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces fir&s;t laid Siege to that Town, the Prie&s;ts, who were apprehen&s;ive of it, having been long &s;ince made &s;en&s;ible of the profound Regard to Cha&s;tity and Mode&s;ty of us Hereticks, by the ignominious Behaviour of certain Officers at <HI>Rota</HI> and <HI>Porta St. Maria,</HI> the Prie&s;ts, I &s;ay, had taken care to &s;end away privately all the Nuns to <HI>Majorca.</HI> But that the He|retick Invaders might have no Jealou&s;y of it, the fair <HI>Curtezans</HI> of the Town were admit|ted to &s;upply their Room. The Officers, both of Land and Sea, as was by the Friars pre-imagin'd, on taking the Town and Ca&s;tle, immediately repair'd to the Grates of the Nunnery, to&s;s'd over their Handker|cheifs, No&s;egays, and other pretty Things; all which were, doubtle&s;s, very graciou&s;ly received by tho&s;e imaginary Reclu&s;es. Thence came it to pa&s;s, that in the &s;pace of a Month or le&s;s, you could hardly fall into Company of any one of our younger Officers, of either &s;ort, but the Di&s;cour&s;e, if it might de&s;erve the Name, was concerning the&s;e beautiful Nuns; and you wou'd have ima|gin'd
<PB N="249" REF="256">
the Price of the&s;e Ladies as well known as that of Fle&s;h in their common Markets. Others, as well as my &s;elf, have often en|deavour'd to di&s;abu&s;e tho&s;e Glorio&s;o's, but all to little purpo&s;e, till more &s;en&s;ible Tokens convinced them, that the Nuns, of who&s;e Fa|vours they &s;o much boa&s;ted, could hardly be perfect Virgins, tho' in a Cloy&s;ter. And I am apt to think, tho&s;e who would palm upon the World like vicious Relations of Nuns and Nunneries, do it on much like Grounds. Not that there are wanting In|&s;tances of Nunneries disfranchis'd, and even demoli&s;h'd, upon very flagrant Accounts; but I confine my &s;elf to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Town of <HI>la Mancha</HI> the <HI>Corrigi|dore</HI> always has his Pre&s;idence, having &s;ix|teen others under his Juri&s;diction, of which <HI>Almanza</HI> is one. They are changed every three Years, and their Offices are the Pur|cha&s;e of an exce&s;&s;ive Price; which occa&s;i|ons the poor People's being extravagantly fleeced, nothing being to be &s;old but at the Rates they impo&s;e; and every Thing that is &s;old paying the <HI>Corrigidore</HI> an Acknowledg|ment in &s;pecie, or an Equivalent to his liking.</P>
<P>WHILE I was here, News came of the Battle of <HI>Almanar</HI> and <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI>; and gi|ving the Victory to that Side, which they e&s;pous'd (that of King <HI>Philip</HI>) they made very great Rejoycings. But &s;oon, alas, for them, was all that Joy converted into Sor|row:
<PB N="250" REF="257">
The next Courier evincing, that the Forces of King <HI>Charles</HI> had been victorious in both Engagements. This did not turn to my pre&s;ent Di&s;advantage: For Convents and Nunneries, as well as &s;ome of tho&s;e Dons, whom afore I had not &s;tood &s;o well with, &s;trove now how mo&s;t to oblige me; not doubting, but if the victorious Army &s;hould march that way, it might be in my Power to double the mo&s;t &s;ignal of their Services in my Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>SOON after an Accident fell out, which had like to have been of an unhappy Con|&s;equence to me. I was &s;tanding in Com|pany, upon the Parade, when a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing flock of Eagles flew over our Heads, where they hover'd for a con&s;iderable time. The Novelty &s;truck them all with Admira|tion, as well as my &s;elf. But I, le&s;s ac|cu&s;tomed to like Spectacles, innocently &s;ay|ing, that in my Opinion, it could not bode any good to King <HI>Philip,</HI> becau&s;e the Eagle compos'd the Arms of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>; &s;ome bu&s;ie Body, in hearing, went and inform'd the <HI>Corrigidore</HI> of it. Tho&s;e mo&s;t magi|&s;terial Wretches embrace all Occa&s;ions of &s;queezing Money; and more e&s;pecially from Strangers. However finding his Expecta|tions di&s;appointed in me, and that I too well knew the length of his Foot, to let my Money run freely; he &s;ent me next Day to <HI>Alercon</HI>; but the Governor of that
<PB N="251" REF="258">
Place having had before Intelligence, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army was advancing that way, refus'd to receive me, &s;o I return'd as I went; only the Gentlemen of the Place, as they had condol'd the fir&s;t, congratulated the la&s;t; for that <HI>Corrigidore</HI> &s;tood but very indifferently in their Affections. However, it was a warning to me ever after, how I made u&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Freedom in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Territory.</P>
<P>AS I had attain'd the Acquaintance of mo&s;t of the Clergy, and Religious of the Place; &s;o particularly I had my aim in ob|taining that of the Provincial of the <HI>Car|melites.</HI> His Convent, tho' &s;mall, was ex|ceeding neat; but what to me was much more agreeable, there were very large Gar|dens belonging to it, which often furni&s;hed me with Sallading and Fruit, and much oftner with Walks of Refre&s;hment, the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory Amu&s;ement in this warm Cli|mate. This Acquaintance with the Pro|vincial was by a little Incident &s;oon ad|vanced into a Friend&s;hip; which was thus: I was one Day walking, as I us'd to do, in the long Gallery of the Convent, when ob&s;erving the Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> of which there was one at each end; I took notice that one had an In&s;cription un|der it, which was this, <HI>Ecce, Virgo pepe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">it filium:</HI> but the other had no In&s;cription
<PB N="252" REF="259">
at all; upon which, I took out my Pencil, and wrote underneath, this Line:
<Q>Spon&s;a Dei, patri&s;que parens, &amp; filia filii.</Q></P>
<P>THE Friars, who at a little di&s;tance had ob&s;erved me, as &s;oon as I was gone, came up and read what I had writ; reporting which to the Provincial, he order'd them to be writ over in Letters of Gold, and plac'd ju&s;t as I had put 'em; &s;aying, doubt|le&s;s, &s;uch a fine Line cou'd proceed from nothing le&s;s than In&s;piration. This &s;ecur'd me ever after his and their E&s;teem; the lea&s;t advantage of which, was a full Liberty of their Garden for all manner of Fruit, Sallading, or whatever I plea&s;ed: And as I &s;aid before, the Gardens were too fine not to render &s;uch a Freedom acceptable.</P>
<P>THEY often want Rain in this Country: To &s;upply the Defect of which, I ob&s;erved in this Garden, as well as others, an Inven|tion not unu&s;eful. There is a Well in the middle of the Garden, and over that a Wheel with many Pitchers, or Buckets, one under another, which Wheel being turn|ed round by an A&s;s, the Pitchers &s;coop up the Water on one Side, and throw it out on the other into a Trough, that by little Channels conveys it, as the Gardiner di|rects, into every part of the Garden. By this Means their Flowers and their Sallad|ing
<PB N="253" REF="260">
are continually refre&s;h'd, and pre&s;erved from the otherwi&s;e over-parching Beams of the Sun.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dan|ger of the Inqui&s;ition.</NOTE>THE Inqui&s;ition, in almo&s;t every Town in <HI>Spain</HI> (and more e&s;pecially, if of any great Account) has its Spies, or Informers, for treacherous Intelligence.

Na|ture having appointed no &s;uch happy Tokens in the former to fore&s;hew the Danger.

<P>I was walking by my &s;elf, when a Per|&s;on, wholly unknown to me, giving me the civil Salute of the Day, endeavour'd to draw me into Conver&s;ation. After Que&s;tions had pa&s;s'd on general Heads, the Fellow en&s;na|ringly asked me, how it came to pa&s;s, that I &s;how'd &s;o little Re&s;pect to the Image of the crucify'd Je&s;us, as I pa&s;s'd by it in &s;uch a Street, naming it? I made An&s;wer, that I had, or ought to have him always in my Heart crucified. To that he made no Re|ply: But proceeding in his Interrogatories, que&s;tion'd me next, whether I believ'd a Purgatory? I evaded the Que&s;tion, as I
<PB N="254" REF="261">
took it to be en&s;naring; and only told him that I &s;hould be willing to hear him offer any Thing that might convince me of the Truth, or Probability of it. Truth? He reply'd in a Heat: There never yet was Man &s;o Holy as to enter Heaven without fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing through Purgatory. In my O|pinion, &s;aid I, there will be no Difficulty in convincing a rea&s;onable Man to the contra|ry. What mean you by that, cry'd the Spy? I mean, &s;aid I, that I can name one, and a great Sinner too, who went into Bli&s;s without any Vi&s;it to Purgatory. Name him, if you can, reply'd my Queri&s;t. What think you of the Thief upon the Cro&s;s, &s;aid I? to whom our dying Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Hodie eris mecum in Paradi&s;o.</HI> At which being &s;ilenced tho' not convicted, he turned from me in a violent Rage, and left me to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>WHAT increas'd my fir&s;t Su&s;picion of him was, that a very &s;hort time after, my Friend the Provincial &s;ent to &s;peak with me; and repeating all Pa&s;&s;ages between the holy Spy and me, a&s;&s;ur'd me that he had been forc'd to argue in my Favour, and tell him that I had &s;aid nothing but well: <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>all ought to have the Holy Je&s;us crucified in their Hearts.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"Neverthele&s;s, continu'd he, it is a commendable and good Thing to have him repre&s;ented in the high Ways: For, &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid he,

And thus ended that Con|ference.</P>
<P>I remember upon &s;ome other occa&s;ional Conver&s;ation after, the Provincial told me, that in the <HI>Carmelite</HI> Nunnery next to his Convent, and under his Care, there was a Nun, that was Daughter to <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>; if &s;o, her Age mu&s;t render her venerable, as her Quality.</P>
<P>TAKING notice one Day, that all the People of the Place fetch'd their Water from a Well without the Town, altho' they had many &s;eemingly as good within; I &s;poke to <HI>Don Felix</HI> of it, who gave me, under the Seal of Secrecy, this Rea&s;on for it:
<Q REND="inline">"When the Seat of the War, &s;aid he, lay in the&s;e Parts, the <HI>French</HI> Train of Artillery was commonly quarter'd in this Place; the Officers and Soldiers of which were &s;o very rampant and rude, in attempting to debauch our Women, that there is not a Well within the Town, which has not &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Mens Bones at the bottom of it; therefore the Natives, who are &s;en|&s;ible of it, choo&s;e rather to go farther a field."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="263">BY this Well there runs a little Rivulet, which gives head to that famous River call'd the <HI>Guadiana</HI>; which running for &s;ome Leagues under Ground, affords a pretence for the Natives to boa&s;t of a Bridge on which they feed many Thou&s;ands of Sheep. When it ri&s;es again, it is a fine large River, and after a Currency of many Leagues, empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>AS to military Affairs, <HI>Almanar</HI> and <HI>Sara|go&s;a</HI> were Victories &s;o compleat, that no Body made the lea&s;t doubt of their &s;ettling the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> upon the Head of <HI>Charles</HI> the Third, without a Rival.

<P>IN his way to which, even on the la&s;t Day's Journey, it was his great good For|tune to meet the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> with &s;ome few Troops, which his Grandfather <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France</HI> had order'd to his

<P>While Things were in this Manner, un|der Motion in King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Favour, <HI>Charles</HI> the third, with his victorious Army, advan|ces forward, and enters into <HI>Madrid,</HI> of which he made General <HI>Stanhope</HI> Governor.

In&s;tead of prudential Accla|mations therefore, &s;uch as might have an|&s;wered the Expectations of a victorious Prince, now entering into their Capital, their Streets were all in a profound Silence, their Balco|nies un-adorn'd with co&s;tly Carpets, as was cu&s;tomary on like Occa&s;ions; and &s;carce an Inhabitant to be &s;een in either Shop or Win|dow.</P>

<P>NEVERTHELESS King <HI>Charles</HI> vi&s;ited, in his March, the Chapel of the Lady <HI>de Ato|cha,</HI> where finding &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours and Standards, taken in the Battle of <HI>Al|manza,</HI> there hung up; he ordered 'em to be taken down, and re&s;tor'd 'em to the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> General.</P>
<P>IT was the current Opinion then, and al|mo&s;t univer&s;al Con&s;ent has &s;ince confirm'd it, that the fal&s;e&s;t Step in that whole War was this Advancement of King <HI>Charles</HI> to <HI>Madrid.</HI> After tho&s;e two remarkable Vi|ctories at <HI>Almanar</HI> and <HI>Sarago&s;a,</HI> had he directed his March to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI> and ob|tain'd Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Place, or &s;ome other near it, he had not only &s;topt all Succours from coming out of <HI>France,</HI> but he would, in a great Mea&s;ure, have prevented the ga|thering together of any of the routed and di&s;pers'd Forces of King <HI>Philip</HI>: And it was the general Notion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I convers'd with while at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that had King <HI>Philip</HI> once again &s;et his Foot up|on <HI>French</HI> Land, <HI>Spain</HI> would never have been brought to have re-acknowledged him.</P>

<P>THE Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> having increas'd the Forces which he brought from <HI>France,</HI> to upwards of twenty thou&s;and Men, marches by <HI>Madrid</HI> directly for <HI>Breuhiga,</HI> where his Intelligence inform'd him General <HI>Stan|hope</HI> lay, and that &s;o &s;ecretly as well as &s;wiftly, that that General knew nothing of it, nor could be per&s;uaded to believe it, till the very Moment their Bullets from the Ene|my's Cannon convinc'd him of the Truth. <HI>Breuhiga,</HI> I have &s;aid, was wall'd only on one Side, and yet on that very Side the Enemy made their Attack. But what could a Handful do a|gain&s;t a Force &s;o much &s;uperior, though they had not been in want of both Powder and Ball; and in want of the&s;e were forc'd to make u&s;e of Stones again&s;t all Sorts of Ammunition, which the Enemy ply'd them with? The Con&s;equence an&s;wered the Deficiency; they were all made Pri&s;oners of War, and <HI>Har|vey</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e among the re&s;t; which, to augment their Calamity, was im|mediately remounted by the Enemy, and march'd along with their Army to attack General <HI>Staremberg.</HI></P>

of being joined with: However he thought it not improper to make &s;ome lit|tle Advance towards him; and accordingly breaking up from his Camp at <HI>Cifuentes,</HI> he came back to <HI>Villa vicio&s;a,</HI> a little Town between <HI>Cifuentes</HI> and <HI>Breuhiga</HI>; there he found <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> ready to attack him, before he could well be prepared for him, but no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to join him, as he had expected; neverthele&s;s, the Battle was hot, and ob&s;ti|nately fought; although <HI>Staremberg</HI> had vi|&s;ibly the Advantage, having beat the Ene|my at lea&s;t a League from their Cannon; at which Time hearing of the Misfortune of <HI>Breuhiga,</HI> and finding him&s;elf thereby fru|&s;trated of tho&s;e expected Succours to &s;up|port him, he made a hand&s;ome Retreat to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which in common Calculation is about one hundred Leagues, without any Di&s;turbance of an Enemy that &s;eem'd glad to be rid of him. Neverthele&s;s his Baggage having fallen into the Hands of the Enemy, at the Beginning of the Fight, King <HI>Phi|lip</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> generou&s;ly return'd it unopen'd, and untouch'd, in ac|knowledgment of his brave Behaviour.</P>
<P>I HAD like to have omitted one material Pa&s;&s;age, which I was very credibly inform|ed of; That General <HI>Carpenter</HI> offered to have gone, and have join'd General <HI>Starem|berg</HI> with the Hor&s;e, which was refus'd him. This was certainly an Over&s;ight of the high|e&s;t

Nature; &s;ince his going would have &s;trengthen'd <HI>Staremberg</HI> almo&s;t to the A&s;&s;u|rance of an intire Victory; whereas his Stay was of no manner of Service, but quite the contrary: For, as I &s;aid before, the Enemy, by re-mounting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e (which perhaps were the compleate&s;t of any Regi|ment in the World) turn'd, if I may be al|lowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, the Strength of our Artillery upon our Allies.</P>
<P>UPON this Retreat of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> and the Surprize at <HI>Breuhiga,</HI> there were great Rejoicings at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and every where el&s;e, where King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Intere&s;t prevailed. And indeed it might be &s;aid, from that Day the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI> look'd with a very lowering A&s;pect. I was &s;till a Pri&s;oner at <HI>la Mancha,</HI> when this News arriv'd; and very &s;en&s;ibly affected at that &s;trange Turn of Fortune. I was in Bed, when the Expre&s;s pa&s;s'd through the Town, in order to con|vey it farther; and in the Middle of the Night I heard a certain <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don, with whom, a little before, I had had &s;ome lit|tle Variance, thundering at my Door, en|deavoring to bur&s;t it open, with, as I had Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, no very favourable De|&s;ign upon me. But my Landlady, who hi|therto had always been kind and careful, calling Don <HI>Felix,</HI> and &s;ome others of my Friends together, &s;av'd me from the Fury of his De&s;igns, whatever they were.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="270">AMONG other Expre&s;&s;ions of the general Joy upon this Occa&s;ion, there was a Bull-Fea&s;t at <HI>la Mancha</HI>; which being much be|yond what I &s;aw at <HI>Valencia,</HI> I &s;hall here give a De&s;cription of. The&s;e Bull-Fea&s;ts are not &s;o common now in <HI>Spain</HI> as formerly, King <HI>Philip</HI> not taking much Delight in them. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;oon as it was pub|li&s;h'd here, that there was to be one, no o|ther Di&s;cour&s;e was heard; and in the Talk of the Bulls, and the great Preparations for the Fea&s;t, Men &s;eem'd to have lo&s;t, or to have lay'd a&s;ide, all Thoughts of the very Occa&s;ion. A Week's time was allow'd for the Building of Stalls for the Bea&s;ts, and Scaffolds for the Spectators, and other ne|ce&s;&s;ary Preparations for the &s;etting off their Joy with the mo&s;t &s;uitable Splendour.</P>
<P>ON the Day appointed for the bringing the Bulls into Town, the <HI>Cavalieroes</HI> mount|ed their Hor&s;es, and, with Spears in their Hands, rode out of Town about a League, or &s;omewhat more to meet them: If any of the Bulls break from the Drove, and make an Excur&s;ion (as they frequently do) the <HI>Cavaliero</HI> that can make him return again to his Station among his Companions, is held in Honour, &s;uitable to the Dexterity and Addre&s;s he performs it with. On their Entrance into the Town, all the Windows are fill'd with Spectators; a Pope pa&s;&s;ing in grand Proce&s;&s;ion could not have more; for
<PB N="264" REF="271">
what can be more than all? And he or &s;he who &s;hould neglect &s;o rare a Show, would give Occa&s;ion to have his or her Legitimacy call'd in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHEN they come to the <HI>Plaza,</HI> where the Stalls and Scaffolds are built, and upon which the Feats of Chivalry are to be per|formed, it is often with a great deal of Diffi|culty that the Brutes are got in; for there are twelve Stalls, one for every Bull, and as their Number grows le&s;s by the en&s;talling of &s;ome, the Remainder often prove more untractable and unruly: In the&s;e Stalls they are kept very dark, to render them fiercer for the Day of Battle.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t of the Days appointed (for a Bull-Fea&s;t commonly la&s;ts three) all the Gentry of the Place, or near adjacent, re&s;ort to the <HI>Plaza</HI> in their mo&s;t gaudy Apparel, every one vieing in making the mo&s;t glorious Appearance. Tho&s;e in the lower Ranks provide them&s;elves with Spears, or a great many &s;mall Darts in their Hands, which they fail not to ca&s;t or dart, whenever the Bull by his Nearne&s;s gives them an Oppor|tunity. So that the poor Creature may be &s;aid to fight, not only with the Tauriro (or Bull-hunter, a Per&s;on always hired for that Purpo&s;e) but with the whole Multitude in the lower Cla&s;s at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL being &s;eated, the uppermo&s;t Door is open'd fir&s;t; and as &s;oon as ever the Bull
<PB N="265" REF="272">
perceives the Light, out he comes, &s;nuffing up the Air, and &s;tareing about him, as if in admiration of his Attendants; and with his Tail cock'd up, he &s;purns the Ground with his Forefeet, as if he intended a Challenge to his yet unappearing Antagoni&s;t. Then at a Door appointed for that purpo&s;e, enters the Tauriro all in white, holding a Cloak in one Hand, and a &s;harp two edged Sword in the other. The Bull no &s;ooner &s;ets Eyes upon him, but wildly &s;taring, he moves gently towards him; then gradually mends his pace, till he is come within about the &s;pace of twenty Yards of the Tauriro; when, with a &s;ort of Spring, he makes at him with all his might. The Tauriro knowing by frequent Experience, that it behoves him to be watchful, &s;lips a&s;ide ju&s;t when the Bull is at him; when ca&s;ting his Cloak over his Horns, at the &s;ame Moment he gives him a &s;la&s;h or two, always aiming at the Neck, where there is one particular Place, which if he hit, he knows he &s;hall ea&s;ily bring him to the Ground. I my Self ob&s;erv'd the truth of this Experiment made upon one of the Bulls, who receiv'd no more than one Cut, which happening upon the fatal Spot, &s;o &s;tun'd him, that he remain'd perfectly &s;tupid, the Blood flowing out from the Wound, till after a violent Trembling he dropt down &s;tone dead.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="273">BUT this rarely happens, and the poor Creature oftner receives many Wounds, and numberle&s;s Darts, before he dies. Yet whenever he feels a fre&s;h Wound either from Dart, Spear, or Sword, his Rage receives addition from the Wound, and he pur&s;ues his Tauriro with an Increa&s;e of Fury and Violence. And as often as he makes at his Adver&s;ary, the Tauriro takes care with the utmo&s;t of his Agility to avoid him, and re|ward his kind Intention with a new Wound.</P>
<P>SOME of their Bulls will play their Parts much better than others: But the be&s;t mu&s;t die. For when they have behav'd them|&s;elves with all the commendable Fury po&s;&s;i|ble; if the Tauriro is &s;pent, and fail of do|ing Execution upon him, they &s;et Dogs upon him: Hough him and &s;tick him all over with Darts, till with very lo&s;s of Blood he puts an end to their pre&s;ent Cru|elty.</P>
<P>WHEN dead, a Man brings in two Mules dre&s;s'd out with Bells and Feathers. and fa&s;tening a Rope about his Horns, draws off the Bull with the Shouts and Acclamations of the Spectators; as if the Infidels had been drove from before <HI>Ceuta.</HI></P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot another very common peice of barbarous Plea&s;ure at the&s;e Diver|&s;ions. The Tauriro will &s;ometimes &s;tick
<PB N="267" REF="274">
one of their Bull Spears fa&s;t in the Ground, a&s;lant, but levell'd as near as he can at his Che&s;t; then pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the Bull, ju&s;t before the point of the Spear, on his taking his run at the Tauriro, which, as they a&s;&s;ur'd me, he always does with his Eyes clo&s;ed, the Tauriro &s;lips on one &s;ide, and the poor Creature runs with a violence often to &s;tick him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes to break the Spear in his Che&s;t, running away with part of it till he drop.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Tauriro</HI> was accounted one of the be&s;t in <HI>Spain;</HI> and indeed I &s;aw him mount the back of one of the Bulls, and ride on him, &s;la&s;hing and cutting, till he had quite wearied him; at which time di&s;mounting, he kill'd him with much Ea&s;e, and to the acclamatory Satisfaction of the whole Con|cour&s;e: For variety of Cruelty, as well as Dexterity, admini&s;ters to their De|light.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Tauriroes</HI> are very well paid; and in Truth &s;o they ought to be; for they often lo&s;e their Lives in the Diver&s;ion, as this did the Year after in the way of his Calling. Yet is it a Service of very great Profit when they perform dextrou&s;ly: For when ever they do any Thing remarkable, de&s;erving the Notice of the Spectators, they never fail of a generous Gratification, Money being thrown down to 'em in plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="275">THIS Fea&s;t (as they generally do) la&s;ted three Days; the la&s;t of which was, in my Opinion, much before either of the other. On this, a young Gentleman, who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Pedro Ortega,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Quality, perform'd the Exerci&s;e on Hor&s;e|back. The Seats, if not more crowded, were filled with People of better Fa&s;hion, who came from Places at a di&s;tance to grace the noble <HI>Tauriro.</HI></P>
<P>HE was finely mounted, and made a very graceful Figure; but as when the Foot <HI>Tauriro</HI> engages, the Bull fir&s;t en|ters; &s;o in the Conte&s;t the <HI>Cavaliero</HI> al|ways makes his Appearance on the <HI>Plaza</HI> before the Bull. His Steed was a manag'd Hor&s;e; mounted on which he made his En|try, attended by four Footmen in rich Li|veries; who, as &s;oon as their Ma&s;ter had rid round, and paid his Devoirs to all the Spectators, withdrew from the Dangers they left him expos'd to. The <HI>Cavaliero</HI> having thus made his Bows, and received the repeated <HI>Vivas</HI> of that va&s;t Concour&s;e, march'd with a very &s;tately Air to the very middle of the <HI>Plaza,</HI> there &s;tanding ready to receive his Enemy at coming out.</P>
<P>THE Door being open'd, the Bull ap|peared; and as I thought with a fiercer and more threatning A&s;pect than any of the for|mer.
<PB N="269" REF="276">
He &s;tar'd around him for a con&s;ider|able time, &s;nuffing up the Air, and &s;purning the Ground, without in the lea&s;t taking no|tice of his Antagoni&s;t. But at la&s;t fixing his Eyes upon him, he made a full run at the <HI>Cavaliero,</HI> which he mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly avoid|ed, and at the &s;ame moment of time, pa&s;|&s;ing by, he ca&s;t a Dart that &s;tuck in his Shoulders. At this the Shouts and <HI>Vivas</HI> were repeated; and I ob&s;erved a Handker|chief wav'd twice or thrice, which, as I afterwards under&s;tood, was a Signal from the Lady of his Affections, that &s;he had beheld him with Satisfaction. I took notice that the <HI>Cavaliero</HI> endeavour'd all he could to keep a&s;ide the Bull, for the Advantage of the Stroke, when putting his Hor&s;e on a full Career, he threw another Dart, which fix'd in his Side, and &s;o enrag'd the Bea&s;t, that he &s;eem'd to renew his Attacks with greater Fury. The <HI>Cavaliero</HI> had behav'd him&s;elf to Admiration, and e&s;cap'd many Dangers; with the often repeated Acclama|tions of <HI>Viva, Viva</HI>; when at la&s;t the en|raged Creature getting his Horns between the Hor&s;e's hinder Legs, Man and Hor&s;e came both together to the Ground.</P>
<P>I expected at that Moment nothing le&s;s than Death could be the I&s;&s;ue; when to the general Surprize, as well as mine, the very civil Brute, Author of all the Mi&s;chief, on|ly
<PB N="270" REF="277">
withdrew to the other Side of the <HI>Pla|za,</HI> where he &s;tood &s;till, &s;taring about him as if he knew nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cavaliero</HI> was carry'd off not much hurt, but his delicate Bea&s;t &s;uffer'd much more. However I could not but think afterward, that the good natur'd Bull came &s;hort of fair Play. If I may be pardon'd the Expre&s;&s;i|on, he had us'd his Adver&s;ary with more Humanity than he met with; at lea&s;t, &s;ince, after he had the <HI>Cavaliero</HI> under, he gene|rou&s;ly for&s;ook him; I think he might have pleaded, or others for him, for better Treat|ment than he after met with.</P>
<P>FOR as the <HI>Cavaliero</HI> was di&s;abled and carry'd off, the Foot <HI>Tauriro</HI> enter'd in white Accoutrements, as before; but he flatter'd him&s;elf with an ea&s;ier Conque&s;t than he found: there is always on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, when he apprehends any imminent Danger, a Place of Retreat ready for the Foot <HI>Tau|riro</HI>; and well for him there was &s;o; this Bull oblig'd him over and over to make U&s;e of it. Nor was he able at la&s;t to di&s;|patch him, without a general A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for I believe I &s;peak within Compa&s;s, when I &s;ay, he had more than an hundred Darts &s;tuck in him. And &s;o barbarou&s;ly was he mangled, and &s;la&s;h'd be&s;ides, that, in my Mind, I could not but think King <HI>Philip</HI> in the Right, when he &s;aid, <HI>That it was a Cu&s;tom de&s;erv'd little Encouragement.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278">SOON after this <HI>Tauridore,</HI> or Bull-Fea&s;t was over, I had a Mind to take a plea&s;ant Walk to a little Town, call'd <HI>Minai,</HI> about three Leagues off; but I was &s;carce got out of <HI>la Mancha,</HI> when an Acquaintance meet|ing me, ask'd where I was going? I told him to <HI>Minai</HI>; when taking me by the Hand, <HI>Friend</HI> Gorgio, &s;ays he in <HI>Spani&s;h, Come back with me; you &s;hall not go a Stride further; there are</HI> Picarons <HI>that Way; you &s;hall not go.</HI> Inquiring, as we went back, into his Meaning, he told me, that the Day before, a Man, who had received a Sum of Money in Pi&s;toles at <HI>la Mancha,</HI> was, on the Road, &s;et upon by &s;ome, who had got notice of it, and murdered him; that not finding the Money expected about him (for he had cautiou&s;ly enough left it in a Friend's Hands at <HI>la Mancha</HI>) they concluded he had &s;wallowed it; and therefore they ript up his Belly, and open'd every Gut; but all to as little Purpo&s;e. This diverted my Walk for that Time.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome little Time after, the &s;ame Per|&s;on inviting me over to the &s;ame Place, to &s;ee his Melon-Grounds, which in that Coun|try are wonderful fine and plea&s;ant; I ac|cepted his Invitation, and under the Advan|tage of his Company, went thither. On the Road I took notice of a Cro&s;s newly erected, and a Multitude of &s;mall Stones a|round the Foot of it: Asking the Meaning
<PB N="272" REF="279">
whereof, my Friend told me, that it was rais'd for a Per&s;on there murder'd (as is the Cu&s;tom throughout <HI>Spain</HI>) and that every good Catholick pa&s;&s;ing by, held it his Du|ty to ca&s;t a Stone upon the Place, in De|te&s;tation of the Murder. I had often before taken Notice of many &s;uch Cro&s;&s;es: but never till then knew the Meaning of their Erection, or the Rea&s;on of the Heaps of Stones around them.</P>
<P>THERE is no Place in all <HI>Spain</HI> more fa|mous for good Wine than <HI>Sainte Clemente de la Mancha</HI>; nor is it any where &s;old cheaper: For as it is only an inland Town, near no navigable River, and the People temperate to a Proverb, great Plenty, and a &s;mall Vend mu&s;t con&s;equently make it cheap. The Wine here is &s;o famous, that, when I came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> I &s;aw wrote over the Doors of mo&s;t Hou&s;es that &s;old Wine, <HI>Vino Sainte Clemente.</HI> As to the Temperance of the People, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that notwith&s;tand|ing tho&s;e two excellent Qualities of good and cheap, I never &s;aw, all the three Years I was Pri&s;oner there, any one Per&s;on over|come with Drinking.</P>
<P>IT is true, there may be a Rea&s;on, and a political one, a&s;&s;ign'd for that Ab&s;temiou&s;|ne&s;s of theirs, which is this, That if any Man, upon any Occa&s;ion, &s;hould be brought in as an Evidence again&s;t you, if you can prove that he was ever drunk, it will in|validate
<PB N="273" REF="280">
his whole Evidence. I could not but think this a grand Improvement upon the <HI>Spartans.</HI> They made their Slaves pur|po&s;ely drunk, to &s;hew their Youth the Fol|ly of the Vice by the &s;otti&s;h Behaviour of their Servants under it: But they never reach'd to that noble height of laying a Pe|nalty upon the Aggre&s;&s;or, or of di&s;coura|ging a voluntary Impotence of Rea&s;on by a di&s;reputable Impotence of Intere&s;t. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> therefore, in my Opinion, in this exceeds the <HI>Spartan,</HI> as much as a natural Beauty exceeds one procured by Art; for tho' Shame may &s;omewhat influence &s;ome few, Terrour is of force to deter all. A Man, we have &s;een it, may &s;hake Hands with Shame; but <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;ays another Proverb, <HI>will never lye.</HI> A wi&s;e In&s;titution therefore doubtle&s;s is this of the <HI>Spaniard</HI>; but &s;uch as I fear will never take Place in <HI>Germany, Holland, France,</HI> or <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though I commend their Tempe|rance, I would not be thought by any Means to approve of their Bigotry. If there may be &s;uch a Thing as Intemperance in Religion, I much fear their Ebriety in that will be found to be over-mea&s;ure. Under the notion of Devotion, I have &s;een Men a|mong 'em, and of Sen&s;e too, guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Intemperancies. It is too common
<PB N="274" REF="281">
to be a rarity to &s;ee their Dons of the prime Quality as well as tho&s;e of the lower Ranks, upon meeting a Prie&s;t in the open Streets, con|de&s;cend to take up the lower part of his Ve&s;tment, and &s;alute it with Eyes erected as if they look'd upon it as the Seal of Sal|vation.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Ave-Bell</HI> is heard, the Hearer mu&s;t down on his Knees upon the very Spot; nor is he allowed the &s;mall Indulgence of deferring a little, till he can recover a clean Place; Dirtine&s;s excu&s;es not, nor will dirty Actions by any means exempt. This is &s;o notorious, that even at the Play-hou&s;e, in the middle of a Scene, on the fir&s;t &s;ound of the Bell, the Actors drop their Di&s;cour&s;e, the Auditors &s;uper&s;ede the indulging of their un&s;anctified Ears, and all on their Knees, bend their Tongues, if not their Hearts, quite a different way, to what they ju&s;t before had been employ'd in. In &s;hort, tho' they pretend in all this to an extraor|dinary Mea&s;ure of Zeal and real Devotion; no Man, that lives among them any time, can be a Pro&s;elyte to them without immola|ting his Sen&s;es and his Rea&s;on: Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, while I have &s;een them thus delude|ing them&s;elves with <HI>Ave Marias,</HI> I cou'd not refrain throwing up my Eyes to the only proper Object of Adoration, in commi&s;erati|on of &s;uch Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">THE Hours of the <HI>Ave Bell,</HI> are eight and twelve in the Morning, and &s;ix in the Evening. They pretend at the fir&s;t to fall down to beg that God would be pleas'd to pro&s;per them in all things they go about that Day. At twelve they return Thanks for their Pre&s;ervation to that time; and at &s;ix for that of the whole Day. After which, one would think that they imagine them|&s;elves at perfect Liberty; and their open Gallantries perfectly countenance the Ima|gination: For tho' Adultery is look'd upon as a grievous Crime, and puni&s;h'd according|ly; yet Fornication is &s;oftned with the title of a Venial Sin, and they &s;eem to practi&s;e it under that Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>I found here, what <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> ridicules with &s;o much Wit and Delicacy, the Cu|&s;tom of burying in a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI>'s Habit, in mighty reque&s;t. If they can for that pur|po&s;e procure an old one at the price of a new one; the Purcha&s;er will look upon him&s;elf a provident Chap, that has &s;ecur'd to his decea&s;ed Friend or Relation, no le&s;s than Heaven by that wi&s;e Bargain.</P>
<P>THE Evening being almo&s;t the only time of Enjoyment of Company, or Conver&s;a|tion, every body in <HI>Spain</HI> then greedily &s;eeks it; and the Streets are at that time crowd|ed like our fine&s;t Gardens or mo&s;t private Walks. On one of tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, I met
<PB N="276" REF="283">
a Don of my Acquaintance walking out with his Si&s;ters; and as I thought it became an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cavalier, I &s;aluted him: But to my Surprize he never return'd the Civility. When I met him the Day after, in&s;tead of an Apology, as I had flatter'd my &s;elf, I receiv'd a Reprimand, tho' a very civil one; telling me it was not the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain,</HI> nor well taken of any one, that took No|tice of any who were walking in the Com|pany of Ladies at Night.</P>
<P>BUT a Night or two after, I found by Experience, that if the Men were by Cu|&s;tom prohibited taking Notice, Women were not. I was &s;tanding at the Door, in the cool of the Evening, when a Woman &s;eemingly genteel, pa&s;&s;ing by, call'd me by my Name, telling me &s;he wanted to &s;peak with me: She had her <HI>Mantilio</HI> on; &s;o that had I had Day-light, I could have only &s;een one Eye of her. However I walk'd with her a good while, without being able to di&s;cover any thing of her Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor pa&s;s'd there between us any thing more than a Conver&s;ation upon indifferent Matters. Ne|verthele&s;s, at parting &s;he told me &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s by again the next Evening; and if I would be at the Door, &s;he would give me the &s;ame Advantage of a Conver&s;ation, that &s;eem'd not to di&s;plea&s;e me. Accordingly the next Night &s;he came, and as before we
<PB N="277" REF="284">
walk'd together in the private&s;t parts of the Town: For tho' I knew her not, her Di&s;|cour&s;e was always entertaining and full of Wit, and her Enquiries not often improper. We had continu'd this Intercour&s;e many Nights together, when my Landlady's Daughter having taken Notice of it, &s;topt me one Evening, and would not allow me to &s;tand at the u&s;ual Po&s;t of Intelligence, &s;aying, with a good deal of heat, Don Gorgio, <HI>take my Advice; go no more along with that Woman: You may &s;oon be brought home deprived of your Life if you do.</HI> I cannot &s;ay, whether &s;he knew her; but this I mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;he was very agreeable in Wit as well as Per&s;on. However my Land|lady and her Daughter took that Opportu|nity of giving me &s;o many In&s;tances of the fatal I&s;&s;ues of &s;uch innocent Conver&s;ations, (for I could not call it an Intrigue) that apprehen&s;ive enough of the Danger, on lay|ing Circum&s;tances together, I took their Ad|vice, and never went into her Company after.</P>
<P><HI>Sainte Clemente de la Mancha,</HI> where I &s;o long remain'd a Pri&s;oner of War, lies in the Road from <HI>Madrid</HI> to <HI>Valencia</HI>; and the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI> being ordered to the latter, great Preparations were made for his Entertainment, as he pa&s;s'd through. He &s;tay'd here only one Night, where he was
<PB N="278" REF="285">
very hand&s;omely treated by the <HI>Corrigidore.</HI> He was a tall fair Per&s;on, and very fat, and at the time I &s;aw him wore a long black Patch over his left Eye; but on what Oc|ca&s;ion I could not learn. The afterwards famous <HI>Alberoni</HI> (&s;ince made a Cardinal) was in his Attendance; as indeed the Duke was very rarely without him. I remember that very Day three Weeks, they return'd through the &s;ame Place; the Duke in his Her&s;e, and <HI>Alberoni</HI> in a Coach, paying his la&s;t Duties. That Duke was a prodigious Lover of Fi&s;h, of which having eat over heartily at <HI>Veneros,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Va|lencia,</HI> he took a Surfeit, and died in three Days time. His Corps was carrying to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> there to be buried in the <HI>Panthae|on</HI> among their Kings.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ca&s;tilians</HI> have a Privilege by Li|cence from the Pope, which, if it could have been converted into a Prohibition, might have &s;av'd that Duke's Life: In regard their Country is wholly inland, and the River <HI>Tagus</HI> famous for its Poverty, or rather Barrenne&s;s; their Holy Father indulges the Natives with the Liberty, in lieu of that dangerous Eatable, of eating all Lent time the Inwards of Cattle. When I fir&s;t heard this related, I imagin'd, that the Garbidge had been intended, but I was &s;oon after thus rectify'd, <HI>by Inwards</HI> (for

<P>THEY have here as well as in mo&s;t other Parts of <HI>Spain, Valencia</HI> excepted, the mo&s;t wretched Mu&s;ick in the Univer&s;e. Their <HI>Guitars,</HI> if not their <HI>Sole,</HI> are their darling In&s;truments, and what they mo&s;t delight in: Tho' in my Opinion our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors are not much ami&s;s in giving them the Title of <HI>Strum Strums.</HI> They are little better than our <HI>Jews-harps,</HI> tho' hardly half &s;o Mu&s;ical. Yet are they perpetually at Nights di&s;turbing their Women with the Noi&s;e of them, under the notion and name of Serenadoes. From the Barber to the Grandee the Infection &s;preads, and very often with the &s;ame Attendant, Danger: Night Quarrels and Rencounters being the frequent Re&s;ult. The true born <HI>Spani|ards</HI> reckon it a part of their Glory, to be jealous of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, which is too often the Forerunner of Mur|ders; or at be&s;t attended with many other very dangerous Inconveniences. And yet bad as their Mu&s;ick is, their Dancing is the rever&s;e. I have &s;een a Country Girl ma|nage her Ca&s;tanets with the graceful Air of a Dutche&s;s, and that not to common Mu|&s;ick; but to Peoples beating or druming a Tune with their Hands on a Table. I have &s;een half a Dozen couple at a time dance to the like in excellent order.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="287">I ju&s;t now di&s;tingui&s;h'd, by an Exception, the Mu&s;ick of <HI>Valencia,</HI> where alone I ex|perienced the u&s;e of the <HI>Violin</HI>; which tho' I cannot, in re&s;pect to other Countries, call good; yet in re&s;pect to the other parts of <HI>Spain,</HI> I mu&s;t acknowledge it much the be&s;t. In my Account of that City, I omit|ted to &s;peak of it; therefore now to &s;upply that Defect, I will &s;peak of the be&s;t I heard, which was on this unfortunate Occa&s;ion: Several Natives of that Country having received Sentence of Death for their Adhe|rence to King <HI>Charles,</HI> were accordingly ordered to the Place of Execution. It is the Cu&s;tom there, on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, for all the Mu&s;ick of the City to meet near the Gallows, and play the mo&s;t affecting and melancholy Airs, to the very approach of the Condemn'd; and really the Mu&s;ick was &s;o moving, it heightened the Scene of Sorrow, and brought Compa&s;&s;ion into the Eyes of even Enemies.</P>
<P>AS to the Condemn'd, they came &s;tript of their own Cloaths, and cover'd with black Frocks, in which they were led a|long the Streets to the Place of Execution, the Friars praying all the way. When they came through any Street, where any publick Images were fix'd, they &s;tay'd be|fore 'em &s;ome rea&s;onable time in Prayer with the Friars. When they are arriv'd at the
<PB N="281" REF="288">
fatal Place, tho&s;e Fathers leave 'em not, but continue praying and giving them gho&s;tly Encouragement, &s;tanding upon the rounds of the Ladder till they are turn'd off. The Hangman always wears a &s;ilver Badge of a Ladder to di&s;tingui&s;h his Profe&s;&s;ion: But his manner of executing his Office had &s;omewhat in it too &s;ingular to allow of Si|lence. When he had ty'd fa&s;t the Hands of the Criminal, he re&s;ted his Knee upon them, and with one Hand on the Criminal's No|&s;trils, to &s;top his Breath the &s;ooner, threw him&s;elf off the Ladder along with the dying Party. This he does to expedite his Fate; tho' con&s;idering the Force, I wonder it does not tear Head and Body a&s;under; which yet I never heard that it did.</P>
<P>BUT to return to <HI>la Mancha</HI>; I had been there now upwards of two Years, much divert|ed with the good Humour and Kindne&s;s of the Gentlemen, and daily plea&s;ed with the Conver&s;ation of the Nuns of the Nunnery oppo&s;ite to my Lodgings; when walking one Day alone upon the <HI>Plaza,</HI> I found my &s;elf acco&s;ted by a <HI>Clerico.</HI> At the fir&s;t Attack, he told me his Country: But added, that he now came from <HI>Madrid</HI> with a <HI>Potent,</HI> that was his Word, from <HI>Pedro de Dios,</HI> Dean of the Inqui&s;ition, to endea|vour the Conver&s;ion of any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners; that being an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> as a &s;ort
<PB N="282" REF="289">
of a Brother, he had conceived a Love for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore more eagerly embraced the Opportunity, which the Holy Inqui&s;ition had put into his Hands for the bringing over to Mother Church as many Hereticks as he could; that having heard a very good Character of me, he &s;hould think him&s;elf very happy, if he could be in&s;tru|mental in my Salvation;
<Q REND="inline">"It is very true, continu'd he, I have lately had the good Fortune to convert many; and be&s;ides the Candour of my own Di&s;po&s;ition, I mu&s;t tell you, that I have a peculiar knack at Conver&s;ion, which very few, if any, ever could re&s;i&s;t. I am going upon the &s;ame work into <HI>Murcia</HI>; but your good Character has fix'd me in my Re&s;olution of preferring your Salvation to that of others."</Q></P>
<P>TO this very long, and no le&s;s &s;urprizing Addre&s;s, I only return'd, that it being an Affair of moment, it would require &s;ome Con&s;ideration; and that by the time he re|turn'd from <HI>Murcia,</HI> I might be able to re|turn him a proper An&s;wer. But not at all &s;a|tisfy'd with this Reply;
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;ays he, God Almighty is all-&s;ufficient: This mo|ment is too precious to be lo&s;t; he can turn the Heart in the twinkling of an Eye, as well as in twenty Years. Hear me then; mind what I &s;ay to you: I will convince you immediately. You Here|ticks

He went on at the &s;ame ridiculous rate; which &s;oon convinced me, he was a thorough Rattle. However, as a <HI>Clerico,</HI> and con|&s;equently in this Country, a Man dangerous to di&s;oblige, I invited him home to Dinner; where when I had brought him, I found I had no way done an unacceptable thing; for my Landlady and her Daughter, &s;eeing him to be a Clergyman, receiv'd him with a va&s;t deal of Re&s;pect and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>DINNER being over, he began to enter|tain me with a Detail of the many wonder|ful Conver&s;ions he had made upon ob&s;ti|nate Hereticks; that he had convinced the mo&s;t Stubborn, and had &s;uch a <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> that he would undertake to convert any one. Here he began his old round, inter|mixing his Harangue with &s;uch &s;craps and raw &s;entences of fu&s;tian <HI>Latin,</HI> that I grew weary of his Conver&s;ation; &s;o pretending &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence, I took leave, and left him and my Landlady together.</P>

to my great Surprize, I found my <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Mi&s;|&s;ionary &s;till on the Spot, ready to dare me to the Encounter, and re&s;olv'd, like a true Son of the Church militant, to keep la&s;t in the Field of Battle. As &s;oon as I had &s;eat|ed my &s;elf, he began again to tell me, how good a Character my Landlady had given me, which had prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed his Ardour of &s;aving my Soul; that he could not an&s;wer it to his own Character, as well as mine, to be negligent; and therefore he had enter'd into a Re&s;olution to &s;tay my Coming, though it had been later. To all which, I return'd him Abundance of Thanks for his good Will, but pleading Indi&s;po&s;ition and want of Re&s;t, after a good deal of civil Impertinence, I once more got rid of him; at lea&s;t, I took my Leave, and went to Bed, leaving him again Ma&s;ter of the Field; for I under&s;tood next Morning, that he &s;tay'd &s;ome Time after I was gone, with my good Landlady.</P>

To all which I return'd, that he was no Country-man of mine, but an <HI>Iri&s;h-man,</HI> and &s;o perfectly a Stranger to me, that I knew no more of him than what I had from his own Mouth,
<PB N="285" REF="294">
that he was going into <HI>Murcia.</HI> What the Meaning of this Enquiry was, I could never learn; but I could not doubt, but it proceed|ed from their great Care of their <HI>Vicino,</HI> as they call'd me; a Mark of their E|&s;teem, and of which I was not a little proud.</P>
<P>AS was my u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, I had been ta|king my Morning Walk, and had not been long come home in order to Dinner, when in again drops my <HI>Iri&s;h Clerico</HI>: I was con|founded, and vexed, and he could not a|void taking Notice of it; neverthele&s;s, with|out the lea&s;t Alteration of Countenance, he took his Seat; and on my &s;aying, in a cold and indifferent Tone, that I imagin'd he had been got to <HI>Murcia</HI> before this; he reply'd, with a natural Fleer, that truely he was going to <HI>Murcia,</HI> but his Con&s;cience prick|ed him, and he did find that he could not go away with any Satisfaction, or Peace of Mind, without making me a perfect Con|vert; that he had plainly di&s;covered in me a good Di&s;po&s;ition, and had, for that ve|ry Rea&s;on, put him&s;elf to the Charge of Man and Mule, to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cuenca</HI> for a Licen&s;e, under his Hand, for my Conver|&s;ion: For in <HI>Spain,</HI> all private Mi&s;&s;ionaries are obliged to ask Leave of the next Bi&s;hop, before they dare enter upon any Enterprize of this Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295">I was more confounded at this la&s;t A&s;&s;u|rance of the Man than at all before; and it put me directly upon reflecting, whether any, and what Inconveniencies might en|&s;ue, from a Rencounter that I, at fir&s;t, con|ceiv'd ridiculous, but might now rea&s;ona|bly begin to have more dangerous Appre|hen&s;ions of. I knew, by the Articles of War, all Per&s;ons are exempted from any Power of the Inqui&s;ition; but whether car|rying on a Part in &s;uch a Farce, might not admit, or at lea&s;t be liable to &s;ome dange|rous Con&s;truction, was not imprudently now to be con&s;idered. Though I was not fear|ful, yet I re&s;olv'd to be cautious. Where|fore not making any An&s;wer to his Declara|tion about the Bi&s;hop, he took Notice of it; and to rai&s;e a Confidence, he found expiring, began to tell me, that his Name was <HI>Mur|tough Brennan,</HI> that he was born near <HI>Kil|kenny,</HI> of a very con&s;iderable Family. This la&s;t part indeed, when I came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> I found pretty well confirm'd in a con&s;ide|rable Manner. However, taking Notice that he had alter'd his Tone of leaving the Town, and that in&s;tead of it, he was ad|vancing &s;omewhat like an Invitation of him|&s;elf to Dinner the next Day, I re&s;olv'd to &s;how my &s;elf &s;hy of him; and thereupon abruptly, and without taking any Leave, I left the Room, and my Landlady and him together.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="296">THREE or four Days had pa&s;&s;ed, every one of which, he never fail'd my Lodgings; not at Dinner Time only, but Night and Morning too; from all which I began to &s;u&s;pect, that in&s;tead of my Conver&s;ion, he had fix'd upon a Re-conver&s;ion of my Landlady. She was not young, yet, for a black Woman, hand&s;om enough; and her Daughter very pretty: I entered into a Re|&s;olution to make my Ob&s;ervations, and watch them all at a Di&s;tance; neverthele&s;s carefully concealing my Jealou&s;y. However, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was not a little pleas'd, that any Thing could divert my own Per&s;ecuti|on. He was now no longer my Gue&s;t, but my Landlady's, with whom I found him &s;o much taken up, that a little Care might fru|&s;trate all his former impertinent Importuni|ties on the old Topick.</P>
<P>BUT all my Su&s;picions were very &s;oon after turn'd into Certainties, in this Manner: I had been abroad, and returning &s;omewhat weary, I went to my Chamber, to take, what in that Country they call, a <HI>Ce&s;to,</HI> up|on my Bed: I got in un&s;een, or without &s;eeing any Body, but had &s;carce laid my &s;elf down, before my young Landlady, as I je&s;tingly us'd to call the Daughter, ru&s;hing into my Room, threw her &s;elf down on the Floor, bitterly exclaiming. I &s;tarted off my Bed, and immediately running to the Door, who &s;hould I meet there but my <HI>I|ri&s;h</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="297">
<HI>Clerico,</HI> without his Habit, and in his Shirt? I could not doubt, by the <HI>Di&s;habil|l&egrave;</HI> of the <HI>Clerico,</HI> but the young Creature had Rea&s;on enough for her Pa&s;&s;ion, which render'd me quite unable to ma&s;ter mine; wherefore as he &s;tood with his Back next the Door, I thru&s;t him in that gho&s;tly Plight in|to the open Street.</P>
<P>I might, with lei&s;ure enough, have re|pented that precipitate Piece of Indi&s;cretion; if it had not been for his bad Character, and the favourable Opinion the Town had conceived of me; for he inordinately ex|claim'd again&s;t me, calling me Heretick, and telling the People, who were &s;oon gathered round him, that coming to my Lodgings on the charitable work of Conver&s;ion, I had thus abus'd him, &s;tript him of his Habit, and then turn'd him out of Doors. The Nuns, on their hearing the Outcries he made, came running to their Grates, to enquire into the Matter, and when they under&s;tood it, as he was pleas'd to relate it; though they condemn'd my Zeal, they pity'd my Condition. Very well was it for me, that I &s;tood more than a little well in the good Opinion of the Town; among the Gentry, by my frequent Conver&s;ation, and the in|ferior Sort by my charitable Di&s;tributions; for nothing can be more dangerous, or a nearer Way to violent Fate, than to in&s;ult one of the Clergy in <HI>Spain,</HI> and e&s;pecial|ly,
<PB N="289" REF="298">
for &s;uch an one as they entitle a Here|tick.</P>
<P>MY old Landlady (I &s;peak in re&s;pect to her Daughter) however formerly my &s;eem|ing Friend, came in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and wrenching the Door out of my Hands, open|ed it, and pull'd her <HI>Clerico</HI> in; and &s;o &s;oon as &s;he had done this, &s;he took his Part, and railed &s;o bitterly at me, that I had no Rea&s;on longer to doubt her thorough Conver&s;ion, under the full Power of his Mi&s;&s;ion. How|ever the young one &s;tood her Ground, and by all her Expre&s;&s;ions, gave her many In|quirers Rea&s;on enough to believe, all was not Matter of Faith that the <HI>Clerico</HI> had ad|vanced. Neverthele&s;s, holding it advi&s;ea|ble to change my Lodgings, and a Friend confirming my Re&s;olutions, I removed that Night.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerico</HI> having put on his upper Gar|ments, was run away to the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> in a violent Fury, re&s;olving to be early, as well knowing, that he who tells his Story fir&s;t, has the Pro&s;pect of telling it to double Advantage. When he came there, he told that Officer a thou&s;and idle Stories, and in the wor&s;t Manner; repeating how I had a|bus'd him, and not him only, but my poor Landlady, for taking his Part. The <HI>Corri|gidor</HI> was glad to hear it all, and with an officious Ear fi&s;h'd for a great deal more; expecting, according to U&s;age, at la&s;t to
<PB N="290" REF="299">
&s;queeze a Sum of Money out of me. How|ever he told the <HI>Clerico,</HI> that, as I was a Pri|&s;oner of War, he had no direct Power over me; but if he would immediately write to the Pre&s;ident <HI>Ronquillo,</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> he would not fail to give his immediate Orders, according to which he would as readily act again&s;t me.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Clerico</HI> re&s;olv'd to pur&s;ue his old Maxim, and cry out fir&s;t; and &s;o taking the <HI>Corrigidor</HI>'s Advice, he wrote away to <HI>Madrid</HI> directly. In the mean Time the People in the Town, both high and low, &s;ome out of Curio&s;ity, &s;ome out of Friend|&s;hip, pur&s;u'd their Enquiries into the Reality of the Facts. The old Landlady they could make little of to my Advantage; but when|ever the young one came to the Que&s;tion, &s;he always left them with the&s;e Words in her Mouth, <HI>El Diabolo en forma del Cleri|co,</HI> which rendring Things more than a lit|tle cloudy on the <HI>Clerico</HI>'s Side, he was ad|vis'd and pre&s;s'd by his few Friends, as fa&s;t as he could to get out of Town; Nuns, Cler|gy, and every Body taking Part again&s;t him, excepting his new Convert, my old Landlady.</P>
<P>The Day after, as I was &s;itting with a Friend at my new Quarters, <HI>Maria</HI> (for that was the Name of my Landlady's Daugh|ter) came running in with the&s;e Words in her Mouth, <HI>El Clerico, el Clerico, pa&s;&s;a la</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="300">
<HI>Calle.</HI> We ha&s;ten'd to the Window; out of which we beheld the <HI>Clerico, Murtough Brennan,</HI> pitifully mounted on the Back of a very poor A&s;s (for they would neither let, nor lend him a Mule through all the Town) his Legs almo&s;t re&s;ted on the Ground, for he was lu&s;ty, as his A&s;s was little; and a Fellow with a large Cudgel march'd a-foot, driving his A&s;s along. Never did <HI>Sancha Pancha,</HI> on his Emba&s;&s;age to <HI>Dulcinea,</HI> make &s;uch a de&s;picable, out of the way Fi|gure, as our <HI>Clerico</HI> did at this Time. And what increas'd our Mirth was, their telling me, that our <HI>Clerico,</HI> like that Squire (tho' upon his own Prie&s;t-Errantry) was actually on his March to <HI>Tobo&s;o,</HI> a Place five Leagues off, famous for the Nativity of <HI>Dulcinea,</HI> the Object of the Pa&s;&s;ion of that celebrated Hero <HI>Don Quixot.</HI> So I will leave our <HI>Cle|rico</HI> on his Journey to <HI>Murcia,</HI> to relate the unhappy Sequel of this ridiculous Af|fair.</P>
<P>I have before &s;aid, that, by the Advice of the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> our <HI>Clerico</HI> had wrote to <HI>Don Ronquillo</HI> at <HI>Madrid.</HI> About a Fort|night after his Departure from <HI>la Mancha,</HI> I was &s;itting alone in my new Lodgings, when two <HI>Alguizils</HI> (Officers under the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> and in the Nature of our Bailiffs) came into my Room, but very civilly, to tell me, that they had Orders to carry me away to Pri&s;on; but at the &s;ame Moment
<PB N="292" REF="301">
they advis'd me, not to be afraid; for they had ob&s;erved, that the whole Town was concern'd at what the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> and <HI>Clerico</HI> had done; adding, that it was their Opini|on, that I &s;hould find &s;o general a Friend|&s;hip, that I need not be apprehen&s;ive of any Danger. With the&s;e plau&s;ible Speeches, though I afterwards experienced the Truth of them, I re&s;ign'd my &s;elf, and went with them to a much clo&s;er Confinement.</P>
<P>I had not been there above a Day or two, before many Gentlemen of the Place &s;ent to me, to a&s;&s;ure me, they were heartily afflicted at my Confinement, and re&s;olv'd to write in my Favour to <HI>Madrid</HI>; but as it was not &s;afe, nor the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain,</HI> to vi&s;it tho&s;e in my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, they hoped I would not take it ami&s;s, &s;ince they were bent to act all in their Power towards my Deli|verance; concluding however with their Advice, that I would not give one <HI>Real of Plata</HI> to the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> whom they hated, but confide in their a&s;&s;iduous Interpo&s;al. Don <HI>Pedro de Ortega</HI> in particular, the Per&s;on that perform'd the Part of the <HI>Tau|riro</HI> on Hor&s;eback, &s;ometime before, &s;ent me Word, he would not fail to write to a Relation of his, of the fir&s;t Account in <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> and &s;o repre&s;ent the Affair, that I &s;hould not long be debarr'd my old Ac|quaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302">IT may admini&s;ter, perhaps, Matter of Wonder, that <HI>Spaniards,</HI> Gentlemen of the &s;tanche&s;t Punctilio, &s;hould make a Scruple, and excu&s;e them&s;elves from vi&s;iting Per&s;ons under Confinement, when, according to all Chri&s;tian Acceptation, &s;uch a Circum&s;tance would render &s;uch a Vi&s;it, not charitable on|ly, but generous. But though Men of vul|gar Spirits might, from the Narrowne&s;s of their Views, form &s;uch in&s;ipid Excu&s;es, tho&s;e of the&s;e Gentlemen, I very well knew, proceeded from much more excu&s;able To|picks. I was committed under the Accu&s;a|tion of having abus'd a &s;acred Per&s;on, one of the Clergy; and though, as a Pri&s;oner of War, I might deem my &s;elf exempt from the Power of the Inqui&s;ition; yet how far one of that Country, vi&s;iting a Per&s;on, &s;o accu&s;ed, might be e&s;teemed culpable, was a con&s;ideration in that dangerous Climate, far from de&s;erving to be &s;lighted. To me there|fore, who well knew the Cu&s;toms of the Country, and the Temper of its Country|men, their Excu&s;es were not only allowable, but acceptable al&s;o; for, without calling in Que&s;tion their Charity, I verily believ'd I might &s;afely confide in their Honour.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, after I had been a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner one Month to a Day, I found the Benefit of the&s;e Gentlemens Promi&s;es and Solicitations. Pur&s;uant to which, an Or|der was brought for my immediate Di&s;|charge;
<PB N="294" REF="303">
notwith&s;tanding, the new Convert, my old Landlady, did all &s;he could to make her appearing again&s;t me effectual, to the Height of her Prejudice and Malice, even while the Daughter, as &s;en&s;ible of my In|nocence, and acting with a much better Con|&s;cience, endeavoured as much to ju&s;tify me, again&s;t both the Threats and Per&s;ua&s;ions of the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> and his few Accomplices, though her own Mother made one.</P>
<P>After Receipt of this Order for my En|largement, I was mightily pre&s;s'd by Don <HI>Felix,</HI> and others of my Friends, to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and enter my Complaint again&s;t the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> and the <HI>Clerico,</HI> as a Thing highly e&s;&s;ential to my own future Security. Without asking Leave therefore of the <HI>Cor|rigidor,</HI> or in the lea&s;t acquainting him with it, I &s;et out from <HI>la Mancha,</HI> and, as I after|wards under&s;tood, to the terrible Alarm of that griping Officer; who was under the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation, when he heard I was gone; for as he knew very well, that he had done more than he could ju&s;tify, he was very apprehen&s;ive of any Complaint; well knowing, that as he was hated as much as I was beloved, he might a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the Want of that A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Gen|tlemen, which I had experienced.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon as I arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire out, and wait up|on Father <HI>Fahy,</HI> Chief of the <HI>Iri&s;h College.</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="304">
He received me very courteou&s;ly; but when I acquainted him with the Treatment I had met with from <HI>Brennan,</HI> and had given him an Account of his other &s;candalous Behavi|our, I found he was no Stranger to the Man, or his Character; for he &s;oon confirm'd to me the Honour <HI>Brennan</HI> fir&s;t boa&s;ted of, his con&s;iderable Family, by &s;aying, that &s;carce an A&s;&s;ize pa&s;&s;ed in his own Country, with|out two or three of that Name receiving at the Gallows the ju&s;t Reward of their De|merits. In &s;hort, not only Father <HI>Fahy,</HI> but all the Clergy of that Nation at <HI>Madrid,</HI> readily &s;ub&s;cribed to this Character of him, <HI>That he was a Scandal to their Country.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, I had nothing more to do, but to get that Father to go with me to <HI>Pe|dro de Dios,</HI> who was the Head of the <HI>Do|minican</HI> Cloy&s;ter, and Dean of the Inqui&s;i|tion. He readily granted my Reque&s;t, and when we came there, in a Manner unexpect|ed, repre&s;ented to the Dean, that having &s;ome good Di&s;po&s;itions towards Mother-Church, I had been diverted from them, he feared, by the evil Practices of one <HI>Mur|tough Brennan,</HI> a Countryman of his, tho' a Scandal to his Country; that under a Pre|tence of &s;eeking my Conver&s;ion, he had lay'd him&s;elf open in a mo&s;t bea&s;tly Manner, &s;uch as would have &s;et a Catholick into a vile Opinion of their Religion, and much more
<PB N="296" REF="305">
one that was yet a Heretick. The Dean had hardly Patience to hear Particulars; but as &s;oon as my Friend had ended his Nar|ration, he immediately gave his Orders, pro|hibiting <HI>Murtough</HI>'s &s;aying any more Ma&s;&s;es, either in <HI>Madrid,</HI> or any other Place in <HI>Spain.</HI> This indeed was taking away the poor Wretches &s;ole Sub&s;i&s;tence, and put|ting him ju&s;t upon an Equality with his De|merits.</P>
<P>I took the &s;ame Opportunity to make my Complaints of the <HI>Corrigidor</HI>; but his Term expiring very &s;oon, and a Proce&s;s being likely to be chargeable, I was advi&s;ed to let it drop. So having effected what I came for, I returned to my old Station at <HI>la Man|cha.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I came back, I found a new <HI>Cor|rigidor,</HI> as I had been told there would, by the Dean of the Inqui&s;ition, who, at the &s;ame Time, advi&s;ed me to wait on him. I did &s;o, &s;oon after my Arrival, and then ex|perienced the Advice to be well intended; the Dean having wrote a Letter to him, to order him to treat me with all Manner of Civility. He &s;how'd me the very Letter, and it was in &s;uch particular and obliging Terms, that I could not but perceive he had taken a Re&s;olution, if po&s;&s;ible, to eradicate all the evil Impre&s;&s;ions, that <HI>Murtough</HI>'s Be|haviour might have given too great Oc|ca&s;ion for. This &s;erv'd to confirm me in an
<PB N="297" REF="306">
Ob&s;ervation that I had long before made, That a Prote&s;tant, who will prudently keep his Sentiments in his own Brea&s;t, may command any Thing in <HI>Spain;</HI> where their &s;tiff Bigotry leads 'em naturally into that o|ther Mi&s;take, That not to oppo&s;e, is to a&s;&s;ent. Be&s;ides, it is generally among them, almo&s;t a work of Supererogation to be even in&s;tru|mental in the Conver&s;ion of one they call a Heretick. To bring any &s;uch back to what they call Mother Church, nothing &s;hall be &s;par'd, nothing thought too much: And if you have In&s;incerity enough to give them Hopes, you &s;hall not only live in Ea&s;e, but in Plea&s;ure and Plenty.</P>
<P>I had entertain'd &s;ome thoughts on my Journey back, of taking up my old Quar|ters at the Widow's; but found her &s;o intirely converted by her <HI>Clerico,</HI> that there wou'd be no room to expect Peace: For which Rea&s;on, with the help of my fair <HI>Vicinos,</HI> and <HI>Don Felix,</HI> I took another, where I had not been long, before I receiv|ed an unhappy Account of <HI>Murtough's</HI> Con|duct in <HI>Murcia.</HI> It &s;eems he had kept his Re&s;olution in going thither; where meeting with &s;ome of his own Countrymen, though he found 'em &s;tanch good Catholicks, he &s;o far inveigled him&s;elf into 'em, that he brought them all into a foul chance for their Lives. There were three of 'em, all Soldiers, in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiment, but in a
<PB N="298" REF="307">
fit of ambitious, though frantick, Zeal: <HI>Murtough</HI> had wheedled them to go along with him to <HI>Pedro de Dios,</HI> Dean of the Inqui&s;ition, to declare and acknowledge be|fore him, that they were converted and brought over to Mother Church, and by him only. The poor Ignorants, thus intic'd, had left their Regiment, of which the Colo|nel, having notice, &s;ent after them, and they were overtaken on the Road, their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionair</HI> with them. But notwith&s;tanding all his Oratory, nay, even the Di&s;covery of the whole Farce, one of them was hang'd for an Example to the other two.</P>
<P>IT was not long after my Return before News arriv'd of the Peace; which though they receiv'd with Joy, they could hardly entertain with Belief. Upon which, the new <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> with whom I held a better Corre&s;pondence than I had done with the old one, de&s;ired me to produce my Letters from <HI>England,</HI> that it was true. Never did People give greater Demon&s;trations of Joy, than they upon this Occa&s;ion. It was the common cry in the Streets, <HI>Paz con Angle|terra, con todo Mundo Guerra</HI>; And my Confirmation did them as much Plea&s;ure as it did Service to me; for if po&s;&s;ible, they treated me with more Civility than before.</P>
<P>BUT the Peace &s;oon after being pro|claimed, I received Orders to repair to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners
<PB N="299" REF="308">
taken at <HI>Denia</HI> had been carried; when I, by rea&s;on of my Wounds, and want of Health, had been left behind. Others I under&s;tood lay ready, and &s;ome were on their March to <HI>Bayone</HI> in <HI>France</HI>; where Ships were or|dered for their Tran&s;portation into <HI>England.</HI> So after a Re&s;idence of three Years and three Months; having taken leave of all my Acquaintance, I left a Place, that was almo&s;t become natural to me, the delicious <HI>Sainte Clemente de la Mancha.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING of Moment, or worth ob&s;erv|ing, met I with, till I came near <HI>Ocanna</HI>; and there occurred a Sight ridiculous e|nough. The Knight of the Town, I la&s;t came from, the ever renown'd <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> never made &s;uch a Figure as a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> I there met on the Road. He was mounted on a Mule of the large&s;t &s;ize, and yet no way un&s;izeable to his Per&s;on: He had two Pi&s;tols in his Hol&s;ters, and one on each &s;ide &s;tuck in his Belt; a &s;ort of large Blunder|bu&s;s in one of his Hands, and the fellow to it &s;lung over his Shoulders hung at his Back. All the&s;e were accompany'd with a right <HI>Spani&s;h Spado,</HI> and an Attendant <HI>Stiletto,</HI> in their cu&s;tomary Po&s;ition. The Muletier that was my Guide, calling out to him in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> told him he was very well arm'd; to which, with a great deal of Gravity, the Don returned An&s;wer, by Saint Jago <HI>a Man cannot be too well arm'd in &s;uch dan|gerous Times.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="309">I took up my Quarters that Night at <HI>O|canna,</HI> a large, neat, and well built Town. Hou&s;es of good Reception, and Entertain|ment, are very &s;carce all over <HI>Spain</HI>; but that, where I then lay, might have pa&s;s'd for good in any other Country. Yet it gave me a Notion quite different to what I found: for I imagined it to proceed from my near Approach to the Capital. But in|&s;tead of that, contrary to all other Coun|tries, the nearer I came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Hou&s;es of Entertainment grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; not in their Rates do I mean (for that with Rea&s;on enough might have been expected) but even in their Provi&s;ion, and Places and way of Reception. I could not however forbear &s;miling at the Rea&s;on given by my Muletier, that it proceeded from a piece of Court Policy, in Order to oblige all Travellers to ha&s;ten to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>TWO &s;mall Leagues from <HI>Ocanna</HI> we ar|rived at <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> a Seat of Plea&s;ure, which the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> commonly &s;elect for their place of Re&s;idence during the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May.</HI> It is di&s;tant from <HI>Madrid</HI> about &s;even Leagues; and the Country round is the plea&s;ante&s;t in all <HI>Spain, Valencia</HI> excepted. The Hou&s;e it &s;elf makes but a very indifferent Appearance; I have &s;een many a better in <HI>England,</HI> with an Owner to it of no more than five hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>; yet the Gardens are
<PB N="301" REF="310">
large and fine; or as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay, the fine&s;t in all <HI>Spain,</HI> which with them is all the World. They tell you at the &s;ame Time, that tho&s;e of <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> in their mo&s;t beautiful Parts, took their Model from the&s;e. I never &s;aw tho&s;e at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI>: But in my Opinion, the Walks at <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> tho' noble in their length, lo&s;e much of their Beauty by their Narrowne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Water-works here are a great Cu|rio&s;ity; to which the River <HI>Tagus</HI> running along clo&s;e by, does mightily contribute. That River is let into the Gardens by a va&s;t number of little Canals, which with their plea&s;ing <HI>Maeanders</HI> divert the Eye with in|expre&s;&s;ible Delight. The&s;e pretty Wande|rers by Pipes properly plac'd in them, af|ford Varieties &s;carce to be believ'd or ima|gin'd; and which would be grateful in any Climate; but much more, where the Air, as it does here, wants in the Summer Months perpetual cooling.</P>
<P>TO &s;ee a &s;preading Tree, as growing in its natural Soil, di&s;tingui&s;h'd from its pine|ing Neighbourhood by a gentle refre&s;hing Shower, which appears &s;oftly di&s;tilling from every Branch and Leaf thereof, while Na|ture all around is &s;miling, without one li|quid &s;ign of Sorrow, to me appear'd &s;ur|prizingly plea&s;ing. And the more when I ob&s;erv'd that its Neighbours receiv'd not any the lea&s;t Benefit of that plentiful Effu|&s;ion:
<PB N="302" REF="311">
And yet a very few Trees di&s;tant, you &s;hould find a dozen together under the &s;ame healthful <HI>Sudor.</HI> Where Art imitates Nature well, Philo&s;ophers hold it a Perfec|tion: Then what mu&s;t &s;he exact of us, where we find her tran&s;cendent in the Per|fections of Nature?</P>

<P>I took notice before of the &s;traitne&s;s of their Walks: But tho' to me it might &s;eem a Diminution of their Beauty: I am apt to

believe to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> for and by whom they were laid out, it may &s;eem otherwi&s;e. They, of both Sexes, give them&s;elves &s;o in|tolerably up to Amouring, that on that Ac|count the Clo&s;ene&s;s of the Walks may be look'd upon as an Advantage rather than a Defect. The grand Avenue to the Hou&s;e is much more &s;tately, and compos'd as they are, of Rows of Trees, &s;omewhat larger than our large&s;t Limes, who&s;e Leaves are all of a perfect Pea bloom Colour, together with their Grandeur, they &s;trike the Eye with a plea&s;ing Beauty.

<P>WHEN we arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> a Town much &s;poken of by Natives, as well as Strangers, tho' I had &s;een it before, I could hardly re&s;train my &s;elf from being &s;urpri|zed to find it only environ'd with Mud Walls. It may very ea&s;ily be imagin'd, they were never intended for Defence, and yet it was a long time before I could find any other u&s;e, or rather any u&s;e at all in 'em. And yet I was at la&s;t con|vinc'd of my Error by a &s;en&s;ible Increa&s;e of Expence. Without the Gates, to half a League without the Town, you have Wine for two Pence the Quart; but within the Place, you drink it little cheaper than you may in <HI>London.</HI> The Mud Walls therefore well enough an&s;wer their Intent of forcing People to re&s;ide there, under pretence of Security; but in reality to be tax'd, for other Things are taxable, as well as Wine, tho' not in like Proportion.</P>
<P>All Emba&s;&s;adors have a Claim or Privi|lege, of bringing in what Wine they plea&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="316">
Tax-free; and the King, to wave it, will at any Time purcha&s;e that Exemption of Duty at the price of five hundred Pi&s;toles <HI>per Annum.</HI> The Convents and Nunneries are allowed a like Licence of free Importation; and it is one of the fir&s;t Advantages they can boa&s;t of; for, under that Licence having a liberty of &s;etting up a Tavern near them, they make a prodigious Advantage of it. The Wine drank and &s;old in this Place, is for the mo&s;t part a &s;ort of white Wine.</P>
<P>BUT if the Mud Walls gave me at fir&s;t but a faint Idea of the Place; I was plea&s;ing|ly di&s;appointed, as &s;oon as I enter'd the Gates. The Town then &s;how'd it&s;elf well built, and of Brick, and the Streets wide, long, and &s;pacious. Tho&s;e of <HI>Atocha,</HI> and <HI>Alcala,</HI> are as fine as any I ever &s;aw; yet is it &s;ituated but very indifferently: For tho' they have what they call a River, to which they give the very fair Name of <HI>la Man&s;uera,</HI> and over which they have built a curious, long, and large Stone Bridge; yet is the Cour&s;e of it, in Summer time e&s;peci|ally, mo&s;tly dry. This gave occa&s;ion to that piece of Railery of a Foreign Emba&s;&s;a|dor, <HI>That the King would have done wi&s;e|ly to have bought a River, before he built the Bridge.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, that little Stream of a River which they boa&s;t of, they improve as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince down the Sides, as far as you can &s;ee, there are
<PB N="306" REF="317">
Coops, or little Places hooped in, for Peo|ple to wa&s;h their Linen (for they very rarely wa&s;h in their own Hou&s;es) nor is it really any unplea&s;ing Sight, to view the re|gular Rows of them at that cleanly Opera|tion.</P>
<P>THE King has here two Palaces; one within the Town, the other near adjoining, That in the Town is built of Stone, the o|ther which is called <HI>Bueno Retiro,</HI> is all of Brick. From the Town to this la&s;t, in Summer time, there is a large covering of Canvas, propt up with tall Poles; under which People walk to avoid the &s;corching heats of the Sun.</P>
<P>AS I was pa&s;&s;ing by the Chapel of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> I &s;aw &s;everal blind Men, &s;ome led, &s;ome groping the Way with their Sticks, going into the Chapel. I had the curio&s;ity to know the Rea&s;on: I no &s;ooner enter'd the Door, but was &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;uch a number of tho&s;e unfortunate People, all kneeling before the Altar, &s;ome ki&s;&s;ing the Ground, others holding up their Heads, crying out <HI>Mi&s;ericordia.</HI> I was informed 'twas Saint <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Day, the Patrone&s;s of the Blind; therefore all who were able, came upon that Day to pay their Devotion: So I left them, and directed my Cour&s;e to|wards the King's Palace.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to the outward Court, I met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman of my Ac|quaintance,
<PB N="307" REF="318">
and we went into the <HI>Piazza's</HI>; whil&s;t we were talking there, I &s;aw &s;everal Gentlemen pa&s;&s;ing by having Badges on their Brea&s;ts, &s;ome white, &s;ome red, and others green: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Orders of Knight|hood in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE>My Friend informed me that there were five Orders of Knighthood in <HI>Spain.</HI> That of the Golden Fleece was on|ly given to great Princes, but the other four to private Gentlemen, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Saint Jago, Alacantara, Saint Salvador de Mont|real,</HI> and <HI>Monteza.</HI></P>
<P>HE likewi&s;e told me, that there were a|bove ninety Places of Grandees, but never filled up; who have the Privilege of being cover'd in the Pre&s;ence of the King, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed into three Ranks. The fir&s;t is of tho&s;e who cover them&s;elves before they &s;peak to the King. The &s;econd are tho&s;e who put on their Hats after they have begun to &s;peak. The third are tho&s;e who only put on their Hats, having &s;poke to him. The Ladies of the Grandees have al&s;o great Re&s;pect &s;how'd them. The Queen ri&s;es up when they enter the Cham|ber, and offers them Cu&s;hions.</P>
<P>NO married Man except the King lies in the Palace, for all the Women who live there are Widows, or Maids of Honour to the Queen. I &s;aw the Prince of <HI>A&s;turia</HI>'s Dinner carried through the Court up to him, being guarded by four Gentlemen of the Guards, one before, another behind,
<PB N="308" REF="319">
and one on each Side, with their Carbines &s;houlder'd; the Queen's came next, and the King's the la&s;t, guarded as before, for they always dine &s;eparately. I ob&s;erved that the Gentlemen of the Guards, though not on Duty, yet they are obliged to wear their Carbine Belts.</P>
<P><HI>SAINT I&s;odore,</HI> who from a poor la|bouring Man, by his Sanctity of Life ar|rived to the Title of <HI>Saint,</HI> is the Pa|tron of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and has a Church dedi|cated to him, which is richly adorned with|in. The Sovereign Court of the Inqui&s;iti|on is held at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Pre&s;ident where|of is called the Inqui&s;itor General. They judge without allowing any Appeal for four Sorts of Crimes, <HI>viz.</HI> Here&s;y, Polygamy, Sodomy and Witchcraft, and when any are convicted, 'tis called the Act of Faith.</P>
<P>MOST People believe that the King's great|e&s;t Revenue con&s;i&s;ts in the Gold and Silver brought from the We&s;t Indies (which is a mi&s;take) for mo&s;t Part of that Wealth be|longs to Merchants and others, that pay the Workmen at the Golden Mines of <HI>Po|to&s;i,</HI> and the Silver Mines at <HI>Mexico</HI>; yet the King, as I have been informed, receives about a Million and a half of Gold.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a Saying, that the fine&s;t Garden of Fruit in <HI>Spain</HI> is in the mid|dle of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which is the <HI>Plaza</HI> or Market Place, and truly the Stalls there
<PB N="309" REF="320">
are &s;et forth with &s;uch variety of delicious Fruit, that I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never &s;aw any Place comparable to it; and which adds to my Admiration, there are no Gardens or Orchards of Fruit within &s;ome Leagues.</P>
<P>THEY &s;eldom eat Hares in <HI>Spain</HI> but whil&s;t the Grapes are growing, and then they are &s;o exceeding fat, they are knocked down with Sticks. Their Rabits are not &s;o good as ours in <HI>England</HI>; they have great plenty of Patridges, which are larger and finer feather'd than ours. They have but little Beef in <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e there is no Gra&s;s, but they have plenty of Mutton, and exceeding good, becau&s;e their Sheep feed only upon wild Potherbs; their Pork is de|licious, their Hogs &s;eeding only upon Che&s;t|nuts and Acorns.</P>
<P><HI>MADRID</HI> and <HI>Valladolid,</HI> though Great, yet are only accounted Villages: In the latter <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, by the per|&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit, erect|ed an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seminary; and <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth built a mo&s;t noble Palace, with ex|traordinary fine Gardens. They &s;ay that <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> who fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the We&s;t Indies, dyed there, tho' I have heard he lies buried, and has a Monument at <HI>Sevil.</HI></P>

meer Exchange. Neverthele&s;s, the Stairs by which you a&s;cend up to the Guard Room (which is very &s;pacious too) are &s;tately, large, and curious. So &s;oon as you have pa&s;s'd the Guard Room, you enter into a long and noble Gallery, the right Hand whereof leads to the King's Apartment, the left to the Queen's. Entring into the King's Apartment you &s;oon arrive at a large Room, where he keeps his <HI>Levee</HI>; on one &s;ide whereof (for it takes up the whole Side) is painted the fatal Battle of <HI>Almanza.</HI> I confe&s;s the View &s;omewhat affected me, tho' &s;o long after; and brought to Mind many old Pa&s;&s;ages. However, the Re|flection concluded thus in favour of the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> that we ought to excu&s;e their Va|nity in &s;o expo&s;ing under a <HI>French</HI> General, a Victory, which was the only material one the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could ever boa&s;t of over an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>IN this State Room, when the King fir&s;t appears, every Per&s;on pre&s;ent, receives him with a profound Homage: After which turn|ing from the Company to a large Velvet Chair, by which &s;tands the Father Confe&s;|&s;or, he kneels down, and remains &s;ome Time at his Devotion; which being over, he ri&s;ing cro&s;ies him&s;elf, and his Father Confe&s;&s;or having with the motion of his Hand intimated his Benediction, he then gives Audience to all that attend for that
<PB N="311" REF="322">
purpo&s;e. He receives every Body with a &s;eeming Complai&s;ance; and with an Air more re&s;embling the <HI>French</HI> than the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ceremony. Petitions to the King, as with us, are delivered into the Hands of the Secre|tary of State: Yet in one Particular they are, in my Opinion, worthy the Imitation of other Courts; the Petitioner is directly told, what Day he mu&s;t come for an An|&s;wer to the Office: at which Time he is &s;ure, without any further fruitle&s;s Atten|dance, not to fail of it. The Audience be|ing over, the King returns through the Gallery to his own Apartment.</P>
<P>I cannot here omit an accidental Con|ver&s;ation, that pa&s;s'd between General <HI>Ma|honi</HI> and my &s;elf in this Place. After &s;ome talk of the Bravery of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, he made mention of General <HI>Stanhope,</HI> with a very peculiar <HI>Empha&s;is.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"But, &s;ays he, I never was &s;o put to the Nonplus in all my Days, as that General once put me in. I was on the Road from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and having notice, that that General was going ju&s;t the Rever&s;e, and that in all likelyhood we &s;hould meet the next Day: Before my &s;etting out in the Morning, I took care to order my gay|e&s;t Regimental Apparel, re&s;olving to make the be&s;t Appearance I could to re|ceive &s;o great a Man. I had not tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d above four Hours before I &s;aw t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+tlemen,

who appearing to be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it induc'd me to imagine they were Fore|runners, and &s;ome of his Retinue. But how aba&s;h'd and confounded was I? when putting the Que&s;tion to one of 'em, he made an&s;wer, <HI>Sir, I am the Per&s;on.</HI> Never did Moderation put Vanity more out of Countenance: Tho', to &s;ay Truth, I cou'd not but think his Dre&s;s as much too plain for General <HI>Stanhope,</HI> as I at that juncture thought my own too gay for <HI>Mahoni.</HI> But, added he, that great Man had too many inward great Endow|ments to &s;tand in need of any out&s;ide Decoration."</Q></P>
<P>OF all Diver&s;ions the King takes mo&s;t delight in that of Shooting, which he per|forms with great Exactne&s;s and Dexterity. I have &s;een him divert him&s;elf at Swallow &s;hooting (by all, I think allow'd to be the mo&s;t difficult) and exceeding all I ever &s;aw. The la&s;t time I had the Honour to &s;ee him, was on his Return from that Exerci&s;e. He had been abroad with the Duke of <HI>Medina Sidenia,</HI> and alighted out of his Coach at a back Door of the Palace, with three or four Birds in his Hand, which according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, he carried up to the Queen with his own Hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>There are two Play-hou&s;es in <HI>Madrid,</HI> at both which they act every Day; but their Actors, and their Mu&s;ick, are almo&s;t too in|different
<PB N="313" REF="324">
to be mentioned. The Theatre at the <HI>Bueno Retiro</HI> is much the be&s;t; but as much inferior to ours at <HI>London,</HI> as tho&s;e at <HI>Madrid</HI> are to that. I was at one Play, when both King and Queen were pre&s;ent. There was a &s;plendid Audience, and a great Concour&s;e of Ladies; but the latter, as is the Cu&s;tom there, having Lattices before them, the Ap|pearance lo&s;t mo&s;t of its Lu&s;tre. One very remarkable Thing happen'd, while I was there; the <HI>Ave-Bell</HI> rung in the Middle of an Act, when down on their Knees fell e|very Body, even the Players on the Stage, in the Middle of their Harangue. They re|mained for &s;ome Time at their Devotion; then up they ro&s;e, and returned to the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s they were before engag'd in, beginning where they left off.</P>
<P>THE Ladies of Quality make their Vi&s;its in grand State and Decorum. The Lady Vi&s;itant is carry'd in a Chair by four Men; the two fir&s;t, in all Weathers, always bare. Two others walk as a Guard, one on each Side; another carrying a large Lanthorn for fear of being benighted; then follows a Coach drawn by &s;ix Mules, with her Wo|men, and after that another with her Gen|tlemen; &s;everal Servants walking after, more or le&s;s, according to the Quality of the Per&s;on. They never &s;uffer their Servants to overload a Coach, as is frequently &s;een with us, neither do Coachmen or Chairmen
<PB N="314" REF="325">
go or drive as if they carried Midwives in lieu of Ladies. On the contrary, they affect a Motion &s;o &s;low and &s;o &s;tately, that you would rather imagine the Ladies were every one of them near their Time, and very ap|prehen&s;ive of a Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>I remember not to have &s;een here any Hor&s;es in any Coach, but in the King's, or an Emba&s;&s;ador's; which can only proceed from Cu&s;tom; for certainly finer Hor&s;es are not to be found in the World.</P>
<P>AT the Time of my being here, Cardi|nal <HI>Giudici</HI> was at <HI>Madrid</HI>; he was a tall, proper, comely Man, and one that made the be&s;t Appearance. <HI>Alberoni</HI> was there at the &s;ame Time, who, upon the Death of the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI> had the good Fortune to find the Prince&s;s <HI>Ur&s;ini</HI> his Patrone&s;s. An In&s;tance of who&s;e Ingratitude will plead Pardon for this little Digre&s;&s;ion. That Prince&s;s fir&s;t brought <HI>Alberoni</HI> into Favour at Court. They were both of <HI>Italy,</HI> and that might be one Rea&s;on of that Lady's e|&s;pou&s;ing his Intere&s;t: tho' &s;ome there are, that a&s;&s;ign it to the Recommendation of the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI>; with whom <HI>Alberoni</HI> had the Honour to be very intimate, as the other was always di&s;tingui&s;h'd by that Prin|ce&s;s. Be which it will, certain it is, &s;he was <HI>Alberoni</HI>'s fir&s;t, and &s;ole Patrone&s;s; which gave many People afterwards a very &s;mart Occa&s;ion of reflecting upon him, both
<PB N="315" REF="326">
as to his Integrity and Gratitude. For, when <HI>Alberoni,</HI> upon the Death of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s fir&s;t Queen, had recommended this pre&s;ent Lady, who was his Countrywoman, (&s;he of <HI>Parma,</HI> and he of <HI>Placentia,</HI> both in the &s;ame Dukedom) and had forwarded her Match with the King, with all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i|duity; and when that Prince&s;s, pur&s;uant to the Orders &s;he had received from the King, pa&s;s'd over into <HI>Italy</HI> to accompany the Queen Elect into her own Dominions; <HI>Al|beroni,</HI> forgetful of the Hand that fir&s;t ad|vanced him, &s;ent a Letter to the pre&s;ent Queen, ju&s;t before her Landing, that if &s;he re&s;olv'd to be Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t ba|ni&s;h the Prince&s;s <HI>Ur&s;ini,</HI> her Companion, and never let her come to Court. Accord|ingly that Lady, to evince the Extent of her Power, and the Strength of her Re&s;olution, di&s;patch'd that Prince&s;s away, on her very Landing, and before &s;he had &s;een the King, under a Detachment of her own Guards, in|to <HI>France</HI>; and all this without either al|lowing her an Opportunity of ju&s;tifying her &s;elf, or a&s;&s;igning the lea&s;t Rea&s;on for &s;o un|common an Action.

<P>PUNCTUALLY at the Time appointed, I waited on Father <HI>Fahy,</HI> who, as he promi|&s;ed, carry'd me to the Count's Hou&s;e: He was &s;tepping into his Coach ju&s;t as we got there; but &s;eeing Father <HI>Fahy,</HI> he advan|ced towards us.

<P>COMING from which, Father <HI>Fahi</HI> made me ob&s;erve, in the open Street, a Stone, on which was a vi&s;ible great Stain of &s;omewhat reddi&s;h and like Blood.
<Q REND="inline">"This, &s;aid he, was occa&s;ion'd by the Death of a Coun|tryman of mine, who had the Misfortune to over&s;et a Child, coming out of that Hou&s;e (pointing to one oppo&s;ite to us) the Child frighted, though not hurt, as is natural, made a terrible Out-cry; upon which its Father coming out in a violent Rage (notwith&s;tanding my Countryman

He went on, and told me, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> imme|diately took Sanctuary in the Church, whence &s;ome Time after he made his E&s;cape.

<P>AFTER I had taken Leave of Father <HI>Fa|hy,</HI> and return'd my Thanks for all Civili|ties, I went to pay a Vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>Salter,</HI> who was Secretary to General <HI>Stanhope,</HI> when
<PB N="319" REF="330">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces were made Pri&s;oners of War at <HI>Breuhiga</HI>; going up Stairs, I found the Door of his Lodgings a-jar; and knock|ing, a Per&s;on came to the Door, who ap|peared under &s;ome Surprize at Sight of me.

<P>THE En&s;ign, as he call'd him, appear'd to me under a <HI>Di&s;habile&egrave;</HI>; and the fir&s;t Que|&s;tion he ask'd me, was, if I would drink a Gla&s;s of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer?

<P>HE &s;poke all this with &s;uch an Open|ne&s;s of Heart, that in return of &s;o much Confidence, I confe&s;s'd to him, that I had heard of the Affair, for that it had made no little Noi&s;e all over the Country; that it highly behoved him to take great Care of him&s;elf, &s;ince, as the Relations on both Sides were con&s;iderable, he mu&s;t con&s;equently be in great Danger: That in Ca&s;es of that Nature, no People in the World carry Things to greater Extremities, than the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> He return'd me Thanks for my good Advice, which I under&s;tood, in a few
<PB N="322" REF="333">
Days after, he, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friends, had taken Care to put in Practice; for he was convey'd away &s;ecretly, and af|terwards had the Honour to be made a Peer of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>MY Pa&s;&s;port being at la&s;t &s;ign'd by the Count <HI>de las Torres,</HI> I prepared for a Jour|ney, I had long and ardently wi&s;h'd for, and &s;et out from <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> 1712. in Order to return to my native Country.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I &s;et forward upon my Journey, but having heard, both before and &s;ince my being in <HI>Spain,</HI> very famous Things &s;poken of the <HI>E&s;curial</HI>; though it was a League out of my Road, I re&s;olved to make it a Vi&s;it. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I came there, I was &s;o far from condemning my Curio&s;ity, that I cho&s;e to congratulate my good Fortune, that had, at half a Day's Ex|pence, fea&s;ted my Eyes with Extraordina|ries, which would have ju&s;tify'd a Twelve-months Journey on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of the <HI>E&s;|curial.</HI></NOTE>THE Structure is intirely magnificent, be|yond any Thing I ever &s;aw, or any Thing my Imagination could frame It is compo|&s;ed of eleven &s;everal Quadrangles, with no|ble Cloi&s;ters round every one of them. The Front to the We&s;t is adorn'd with three &s;tately Gates; every one of a different Mo|del, yet every one the Model of nice&s;t Ar|chitecture. The Middlemo&s;t of the three
<PB N="323" REF="334">
leads into a fine Chapel of the <HI>Hieronomites,</HI> as they call them; in which are entertain'd one hundred and fifty Monks. At every of the four Corners of this augu&s;t Fabrick, there is a Turret of excellent Workman&s;hip, which yields to the Whole an extraordina|ry Air of Grandure. The King's Palace is on the North, neare&s;t that Mountain, whence the Stone it is built of was hew'n; and all the South Part is &s;et off with many Galle|ries, both beautiful and &s;umptuous.</P>
<P>THIS prodigious Pile, which, as I have &s;aid, exceeds all that I ever &s;aw; and which would ask, of it &s;elf, a Volume to particu|larize, was built by <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. He lay'd the fir&s;t Stone, yet liv'd to &s;ee it fini&s;h|ed; and lies buryed in the <HI>Panthaeon,</HI> a Part of it, &s;et apart for the Burial-place of &s;uc|ceeding Princes, as well as him&s;elf. It was dedicated to Saint <HI>Laurence,</HI> in the very Foundation; and therefore built in the Shape of a Gridiron, the In&s;trument of that Martyr's Execution; and in Memory of a great Victo|ry obtain'd on that Saint's Day. The Stone of which it is built, contrary to the common Cour&s;e, grows whiter by Age; and the Quarry, whence it was dug, lies near e|nough, if it had Sen&s;e or Ambition, to grow enamour'd of its own wonderful Production. Some there are, who &s;tick not to a&s;&s;ign this Convenience, as the main Cau&s;e of its Situa|tion; and for my Part, I mu&s;t agree, that I
<PB N="324" REF="335">
have &s;een many other Parts of <HI>Spain,</HI> where that glorious Building would have &s;hone with yet far greater Splendour.</P>
<P>THERE was no Town of any Con&s;e|quence pre&s;ented it &s;elf in my Way to <HI>Bur|gos.</HI> Here I took up my Quarters that Night; where I met with an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, who&s;e Name was <HI>White.</HI> As is natural on &s;uch Rencounters, having an&s;wered his En|quiry, whither I was going; he very kind|ly told me, he &s;hould be very glad of my Company as far as <HI>Victoria,</HI> which lay in my Road; and I with equal Frankne&s;s em|brac'd the Offer.</P>
<P>NEXT Morning, when we had mounted our Mules, and were got a little Di&s;tance from <HI>Burgos</HI>; he began to relate to me a great many impious Pranks of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officer, who had been a Pri&s;oner there a lit|tle before I came; concluding all, with &s;ome Vehemence, that he had given greater Oc|ca&s;ion of Scandal and Infamy to his native Country, than would ea&s;ily be wiped off, or in a little Time. The Truth of it is, ma|ny Particulars, which he related to me, were too mon&s;trou&s;ly vile to admit of any Repetition here; and highly meriting that unfortunate End, which that Officer met with &s;ome Time after. Neverthele&s;s the ju&s;t Reflections made by that Father, plainly ma|nife&s;ted to me the Folly of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who, by &s;uch Inadvertencies, to &s;ay no
<PB N="325" REF="336">
wor&s;e, cau&s;e the Honour of the Land of their Nativity to be called in que&s;tion. For tho', no doubt, it is a very fal&s;e Conclu&s;ion, from a &s;ingular, to conceive a general Cha|racter; yet in a &s;trange Country, nothing is more common. A Man therefore, of com|mon Sen&s;e, would carefully avoid all Occa|&s;ions of Cen&s;ure, if not in re&s;pect to him&s;elf, yet out of a human Regard to &s;uch of his Countrymen as may have the Fortune to come after him; and, it's more than proba|ble, may de&s;ire to hear a better and ju&s;ter Character of their Country, and Country|men, than he perhaps might incline to leave behind him.</P>
<P>AS we travelled along, Father <HI>White</HI> told me, that near the Place of our Quartering that Night, there was a Convent of the <HI>Carthu&s;ian</HI> Order, which would be well worth my &s;eeing. I was doubly glad to hear it, as it was an Order mo&s;t a Stranger to me; and as I had often heard from many others, mo&s;t unaccountable Relations of the Severity of their Way of Life, and the very odd Original of their In&s;tituti|on.</P>
<P>THE next Morning therefore, being <HI>Sun|day,</HI> we took a Walk to the Convent. It was &s;ituated at the Foot of a great Hill, ha|ving a pretty little River running before it. The Hill was naturally cover'd with Ever|greens of various Sorts; but the very Sum|mit
<PB N="326" REF="337">
of the Rock was &s;o impending, that one would at fir&s;t Sight be led to apprehend the De&s;truction of the Convent, from the Fall of it. Notwith&s;tanding all which, they have very curious and well ordered Gardens; which led me to ob&s;erve, that, what ever Men may pretend, Plea&s;ure was not incom|patible with the mo&s;t au&s;tere Life. And in|deed, if I may gue&s;s of others by this, no Or|der in that Church can boa&s;t of finer Con|vents. Their Chapel was compleatly neat, the Altar of it &s;et out with the utmo&s;t Mag|nificence, both as to fine Paintings, and o|ther rich Adornments. The Building was an&s;werable to the re&s;t; and, in &s;hort, no|thing &s;eem'd omitted, that might render it beautiful or plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>WHEN we had taken a full Survey of all, we, not without &s;ome Regret, return'd to our very indifferent Inn: Where the better to pa&s;s away the Time, Father <HI>White</HI> gave me an ample Detail of the Original of that Order. I had before-hand heard &s;omewhat of it; neverthele&s;s, I did not care to inter|rupt him, becau&s;e I had a Mind to hear how his Account would agree with what I had al|ready heard.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Bruno,</HI> &s;aid the Father, the Author or Founder of this Order, was not originally of this, but of another. He had a holy Brother of the &s;ame Order, that was his Cell-mate, or Chamber-fellow, who was
<PB N="327" REF="338">
reputed by all that ever &s;aw or knew him, for a Per&s;on of exalted Piety, and of a mo&s;t exact holy Life. This Man, <HI>Bru|no</HI> had intimately known for many Years; and agreed in his Character, that general Con&s;ent did him no more than Ju&s;tice, having never ob&s;erved any Thing in any of his Actions, that, in his Opinion, could be offen&s;ive to God or Man. He was perpetually at his Devotions; and di&s;tin|gui&s;hably remarkable, for never permit|ing any Thing but pious Ejaculations to proceed out of his Mouth. In &s;hort, he was reputed a Saint upon Earth."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THIS Man at la&s;t dies, and, according to Cu&s;tom, is removed into the Chapel of the Convent, and there plac'd with a Cro&s;s fix'd in his Hands: Soon after which, &s;aying the proper Ma&s;&s;es for his Soul, in the Middle of their Devotion, the dead Man lifts up his Head, and with an audi|ble Voice, cry'd out, <HI>Vocatus &s;um.</HI> The pious Brethren, as any one will ea&s;i|ly imagine, were mo&s;t prodigiou&s;ly &s;ur|prized at &s;uch an Accident, and there|fore they earne&s;tly redoubled their Pray|ers; when lifting up his Head a &s;econd Time, the dead Man cried aloud, <HI>Judi|catus &s;um.</HI> Knowing his former Piety, the pious Fraternity could not then entertain the lea&s;t doubt of his Felicity; when, to their great Con&s;ternation and Confu&s;ion
<PB N="328" REF="339">
he lifted up his Head a third Time, cry|ing out in a terrible Tone, <HI>Damnatus &s;um</HI>; upon which they incontinently re|moved the Corps out of the Chapel, and threw it upon the Dunghill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Good <HI>Bruno,</HI> pondering upon the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, could not fail of drawing this Conclu&s;ion; That if a Per&s;on to all Ap|pearance &s;o holy and devout, &s;hould mi&s;s of Salvation, it behov'd a wi&s;e Man to contrive &s;ome Way more certain to make his Calling and Election &s;ure. To that Purpo&s;e he in&s;tituted this &s;trict and &s;evere Order, with an Injunction to them, &s;acred as any Part, that every Profe&s;&s;or &s;hould always wear Hair Cloth next his Skin; ne|ver eat any Fle&s;h; nor &s;peak to one ano|ther, only as pa&s;&s;ing by, to &s;ay, <HI>Memento mori.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THIS Account I found to agree pret|ty well with what I had before heard; but at the &s;ame Time, I found the Redouble of it made but ju&s;t the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ion, it had at fir&s;t made upon my Heart. How|ever having made it my Ob&s;ervation, that a Spirit the lea&s;t contradictory, be&s;t carries a Man through <HI>Spain</HI>; I kept Father <HI>White</HI> Company, and in Humour, 'till we arrived at <HI>Victoria.</HI> Where he added one Thing, by Way of Appendix, in Relation to the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> That every Per&s;on of the So|ciety, is oblig'd every Day to go into their
<PB N="329" REF="340">
Place of Burial, and take up as much Earth, as he can hold at a Gra&s;p with one Hand, in order to prepare his Grave.</P>
<P>NEXT Day we &s;et out for <HI>Victoria.</HI> It is a &s;weet, delicious, and plea&s;ant Town. It received that Name in Memory of a con&s;i|derable Victory there obtained over the <HI>Moors.</HI> Leaving this Place, I parted with Father <HI>White</HI>; he going where his Affairs led him; and I to make the be&s;t of my Way to <HI>Bilboa.</HI></P>
<P>Entring into <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> &s;oon after I left <HI>Vi|ctoria,</HI> I was at a Lo&s;s almo&s;t to imagine, what Country I was got into. By my long Stay in <HI>Spain,</HI> I thought my &s;elf a tolera|ble Ma&s;ter of the Tongue; yet here I found my &s;elf at the utmo&s;t Lo&s;s to under&s;tand Landlord, Landlady, or any of the Family. I was told by my Muletier, that they pretend their Language, as they call it, has continu|ed uncorrupted from the very Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel</HI>; though if I might freely give my O|pinion in the Matter, I &s;hould rather take it to be the very Corruption of all that Confu|&s;ion. Another <HI>Rhodomontado</HI> they have, (for in this they are perfect <HI>Spaniards</HI>) that neither <HI>Romans, Carthaginians, Vandals, Goths,</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> ever totally &s;ubdued them. And yet any Man that has ever &s;een their Country, might cut this Knot without a Hatchet, by &s;aying truly, that neither <HI>Ro|man, Carthaginian,</HI> nor any victorious Peo|ple,
<PB N="330" REF="341">
thought it worth while to make a Con|que&s;t of a Country, &s;o mountainous and &s;o barren.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bilboa</HI> de|&s;cribed.</NOTE>HOWEVER, <HI>Bilboa</HI> mu&s;t be allowed, tho' not very large, to be a pretty, clean and neat Town.

Here I hop'd to have met with an opportunity of Em|barking for <HI>England</HI>; but to my Sorrow I found my &s;elf di&s;appointed, and under that Di&s;appointment, obliged to make the be&s;t of my Way to <HI>Bayonne.</HI></P>
<P>SETTING out for which Place, the fir&s;t Town of Note that I came to, was <HI>Saint Seba&s;tian.</HI> A very clean Town, and neatly pav'd; which is no little Rarity in <HI>Spain.</HI> It has a very good Wall about it, and a pretty Citadel. At this Place I met with two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, who were under the &s;ame &s;tate with my &s;elf; one of them being a Pri&s;oner of War with me at <HI>Denia.</HI> They were going to <HI>Bayonne</HI> to embark for <HI>England</HI> as well as my &s;elf; &s;o we agreed to &s;et out together for <HI>Port Pa&s;&s;age.</HI> The Road from St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> is all over a well pav'd Stone Cau&s;eway; almo&s;t at the end where|of, there acco&s;ted us a great number of young La&s;&s;es. They were all prettily dre&s;s'd, their
<PB N="331" REF="342">
long Hair flowing in a decent manner over their Shoulders, and here and there decora|ted with Ribbons of various Colours, which wantonly play'd on their Backs with the Wind. The Sight &s;urpriz'd my Fellow Tra|vellers no le&s;s than me; and the more, as they advanced directly up to us, and &s;eiz'd our Hands. But a little time undeceiv'd us, and we found what they came for; and that their Conte&s;t, tho' not &s;o robu&s;t as our Oars on the <HI>Thames,</HI> was much of the &s;ame Nature; each contending who &s;hould have us for their Fare. For 'tis here a Cu&s;tom of Time out of mind, that none but young Women &s;hould have the management and profit of that Ferry. And tho' the Ferry is over an Arm of the Sea, very broad, and &s;ometimes very rough, tho&s;e fair Ferriers manage them&s;elves with that Dexterity, that the Pa&s;&s;age is very little dangerous, and in calm Weather, very plea&s;ant. In &s;hort, we made choice of tho&s;e that be&s;t plea&s;ed us; who in a grateful Return, led us down to their Boat under a &s;ort of Mu&s;ick, which they, walking along, made with their Oars, and which we all thought far from being di&s;agreeable. Thus were we tran&s;ported over to <HI>Port Pa&s;&s;age</HI>; not unde&s;ervedly accounted the be&s;t Har|bour in all the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;tay'd not long here after Landing, re&s;olving, if po&s;&s;ible, to reach <HI>Fonterabia</HI>
<PB N="332" REF="343">
before Night; but all the Expedition we could u&s;e, little avail'd; for before we could reach thither the Gates were &s;hut, and good Nature and Humanity were &s;o lock'd up with them, that all the Rhetorick we were Ma&s;ters of could not prevail upon the Governor to order their being opened; for which Rea&s;on we were obliged to take up our Quarters at the Ferry Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When we got up the next Morning, we found the Waters &s;o broad, as well as rough, that we began to enquire after another Pa&s;|&s;age; and were an&s;wer'd, that at the I&s;le of <HI>Conference,</HI> but a &s;hort League upwards, the Pa&s;&s;age was much &s;horter, and expo&s;ed to le&s;s Danger. Such good Rea&s;ons &s;oon de|termin'd us: So, &s;etting out we got there in a very little Time; and very &s;oon after were landed in <HI>France.</HI> Here we found a Hou&s;e of very good Entertainment, a Thing we had long wanted, and much lamented the want of.</P>
<P>WE were hardly well &s;eated in the Hou&s;e before we were made &s;en&s;ible, that it was the Cu&s;tom, which had made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of our Ho&s;t, to entertain all his Gue&s;ts at fir&s;t coming in, with a prolix Account of that remarkable Interview between the two Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I &s;peak &s;afely now, as being got on <HI>French</HI> Ground: For the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in his own Country would have made me to know, that putting <HI>Spain</HI>

However, ha|ving refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, to &s;how our defe|rence to our Ho&s;t's Relation, we agreed to pay our Re&s;pects to that famous little I&s;le he mention'd; which indeed, was the whole burden of the De&s;ign of our crafty Landlord's Relation.</P>
<P>WHEN we came there, we found it a little oval I&s;land, over-run with Weeds, and &s;urrounded with Reeds and Ru&s;hes.
<Q REND="inline">"Here, &s;aid our Landlord (for he went with us) upon this little Spot, were at that juncture &s;een the two greate&s;t Mo|narchs in the Univer&s;e. A noble Pavi|lion was erected in the very middle of it, and in the middle of that was placed a very large oval Table; at which was the Conference, from which the Place re|ceiv'd its Title. There were two Bridges rais'd; one on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ide, the Pa&s;|&s;age to which was a little upon a De&s;cent by rea&s;on of the Hills adjacent; and the other upon the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide, which as you &s;ee, was all upon a Level. The Mu&s;ick playing, and Trumpets &s;ounding, the two Kings, upon a Signal agreed upon, &s;et forward at the &s;ame time; the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarch handing the <HI>Infanta</HI> his Daugh|ter to the Place of Interview. As &s;oon as they were enter'd the Pavilion, on each Side, all the Artillery fired, and

After this, was a mo&s;t &s;plendid and &s;umptuous Entertain|ment; which being over, both Kings re|tir'd into their &s;everal Dominions; the King of <HI>France</HI> conducting his new Queen to <HI>Saint Jean de Luz,</HI> where the Mar|riage was con&s;ummated; and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> returning to <HI>Port Pa&s;&s;age.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>AFTER a Relation &s;o very incon&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent State of the Place; we took Hor&s;e (for Mule-mounting was now out of Fa&s;hion) and rode to <HI>Saint Jean de Luz,</HI> where we found as great a difference in our Eating and Drinking, as we had be|fore done in our Riding. Here they might be properly call'd Hou&s;es of Entertainment; tho' generally &s;peaking, till we came to this Place, we met with very mean Fare, and were poorly accommodated in the Hou&s;es where we lodged.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on that travels this way, would be e&s;teem'd a Man of a narrow Curio&s;ity, who &s;hould not de&s;ire to &s;ee the Chamber where <HI>Louis le grand</HI> took his fir&s;t Nights

He had been often invited, he &s;aid; and I am afraid our Coun|tryman, continued he, will hold him&s;elf &s;lighted, if I delay it longer. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer was a great rarity, and the Ve&s;&s;el lay not at any great di&s;tance from my Lodgings; &s;o without any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rther Per&s;ua&s;ion I con&s;ented. When we came upon the Bridge, to which the Ship we were to go aboard was fa&s;tned, we found, as was cu&s;tomary, as well as ne|ce&s;&s;ary, a Plank laid over from the Ship, and a Rope to hold by, for &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age. The Night was very dark; and I had cau|tiou&s;ly enough taken care to provide a Man with a Lanthorn to prevent Ca&s;ualties. The Man with the Light went fir&s;t, and out of his abundant Complai&s;ance, my Friend, the Officer, would have me follow the Light: But I was no &s;ooner &s;tept upon the Plank after my Guide, but Rope and Plank gave way, and Guide and I tumbled both together into the Water.</P>
<P>THE Tide was then running in pretty &s;trong: However, my Feet in the Fall
<PB N="339" REF="350">
touching Ground, gave me an opportunity to recover my &s;elf a little; at which Time I catch'd fa&s;t hold of a Buoy, which was plac'd over an Anchor on one of the Ships there riding: I held fa&s;t, till the Tide ri&s;ing &s;tronger and &s;tronger threw me off my Feet; which gave an Opportunity to the poor Fel|low, our Lanthorn-bearer, to lay hold of one of my Legs, by which he held as fa&s;t as I by the Buoy. We had lain thus lov|ingly at Hull together, &s;trugling with the increa&s;ing Tide, which, well for us, did not break my hold (for if it had, the Ships which lay brea&s;t a brea&s;t had certainly &s;uck|ed us under) when &s;everal on the Bridge, who &s;aw us fall, brought others with Ropes and Lights to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and e&s;peci|ally my Brother Officer, who had been Acce&s;&s;ary as well as Spectator of our Ca|lamity; tho' at la&s;t a very &s;mall Portion of our Deliverance fell to his &s;hare.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as I could feel a Rope, I quitted my hold of the Buoy; but my poor Drag at my Heels would not on any account quit his hold of my Leg. And as it was next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility, in that Po&s;ture to draw us up the Bridge to &s;ave both, if either of us, we mu&s;t &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll have peri&s;hed, had not the Alarm brought off a Boat or two to our Succour, who took us in.</P>
<P>I was carry'd as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, to a neigh|bouring Hou&s;e hard by, where they took
<PB N="340" REF="351">
immediate care to make a good Fire; and where I had not been long before our in|tended Ho&s;t, the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, came in very much concern'd, and blaming us for not hailing the Ve&s;&s;el, before we made an Attempt to enter. For, &s;ays he, the very Night before, my Ve&s;&s;el was robb'd; and that Plank and Rope were a Trap de|&s;ign'd for the Thieves, if they came again; not imagining that Men in an hone&s;t way would have come on board without asking Que&s;tions. Like the wi&s;e Men of this World, I hereupon began to form Re&s;olu|tions again&s;t a Thing, which was never a|gain likely to happen; and to draw Infe|rences of In&s;truction from an Accident, that had not &s;o much as a Moral for its Founda|tion.</P>
<P>ONE Day after this, partly out of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and partly out of Curio&s;ity, I went to &s;ee the Mint here, and having taken no|tice to one of the Officers, that there was a difference in the Impre&s;s of their Crown Pieces, one having at the bottom the Im|pre&s;s of a Cow, and the other none:
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, reply'd that Officer, you are much in the right in your Ob&s;ervation. Tho&s;e that have the Cow, were not coin'd here, but at <HI>Paw,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Navarr</HI>; where they enjoy the Privilege of a Mint, as well as we. And Tradition tells, &s;ays he, that the Rea&s;on of that
<PB N="341" REF="352">
Addition to the Impre&s;s was this: A certain King of <HI>Navarr</HI> (when it was a Kingdom di&s;tinct from that of <HI>France</HI>) looking out of a Window of the Palace, &s;py'd a Cow, with her Calf &s;tanding a|&s;ide her, attack'd by a Lyon, which had got loo&s;e out of his Menagery. The Lyon &s;trove to get the young Calf into his Paw; the Cow bravely defended her Charge; and &s;o well, that the Lyon at la&s;t, tir'd and weary, withdrew, and left her Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Field of Battle; and her young one. Ever &s;ince which, concluded that Officer, by Order of that King, the Cow is plac'd at the bottom of the Impre&s;s of all the Money there coined."</Q></P>
<P>WHETHER or no my Relator gue&s;s'd at the Moral, or whether it was Fact, I dare not determine: But to me it &s;eem'd appa|rent, that it was no otherways intended, than as an emblematical Fable to cover, and pre|&s;erve the Memory of the Deliverance of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the Fourth, then the young King of <HI>Na|varr,</HI> at that eternally ignominious Slaugh|ter, the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Paris.</HI> Many Hi&s;tori|ans, their own as well as others, agree, that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> had levell'd the Malice of their De&s;ign at that great Prince. They knew him to be the lawful Heir; but as they knew him bred, what they call'd a
<PB N="342" REF="353">
<HI>Hugonot,</HI> Barbarity and Inju&s;tice was ea&s;ily conceal'd under the Cloak of Religion, and the Good of Mother Church, under the veil of Ambition, was held &s;ufficient to po&s;t-pone the Laws of God and Man. Some of tho&s;e Hi&s;torians have deliver'd it as Matter of Fact, that the Con&s;pirators, in &s;earching af|ter that young King, pre&s;s'd into the very A|partments of the Queen his Mother; who having, at the Toll of the Bell, and Cries of the Murder'd, taken the Alarm, on hear|ing 'em coming, plac'd her &s;elf in her Chair, and cover'd the young King her Son with her Farthingale, till they were gone. By which means &s;he found an oppor|tunity to convey him to a Place of more Safety; and &s;o pre&s;erv'd him from tho&s;e bloody Murderers, and in them from the Paw of the Lyon. This was only a private Reflection of my own at that Time; but I think carries &s;o great a Face of Probability, that I can &s;ee no pre&s;ent Rea&s;on to reject it. And to have &s;ought after better Information from the Officer of the Mint, had been to &s;acrifice my Di&s;cretion to my Curio&s;ity.</P>

<P>ABOUT two Leagues from <HI>Victoria,</HI> there is a very plea&s;ant Hermitage plac'd upon a &s;mall ri&s;ing Ground, a murmuring Rivulet running at the bottom, and a pretty neat Chapel &s;tanding near it, in which I &s;aw <HI>Saint Chri&s;topher</HI> in a Gigantick Shape, ha|ving a <HI>Chri&s;to</HI> on his Shoulders.

Pri&s;oners of War into <HI>England.</HI> Ac|cordingly they march'd next Day, and there embark'd.

<P>IN three or four Days Time, a fine and fair Gale pre&s;ented; of which the Ma&s;ter ta|king due Advantage, we &s;ail'd over the Bar into the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay.</HI> This is with Sai|lors, to a Proverb, reckon'd the roughe&s;t of Seas; and yet on our Entrance into it, no|thing appear'd like it. 'Twas &s;mooth as Gla&s;s; a Lady's Face might pa&s;s for young, and in its Bloom, that di&s;cover'd no more Wrinckles: Yet &s;carce had we &s;ail'd three Leagues, before a prodigious Fi&s;h pre&s;ented it &s;elf to our View. As near as we could gue&s;s, it might be twenty Yards in Length; and it lay &s;porting it &s;elf on the Surface of the Sea, a great Part appearing out of the Water. The Sailors, one and all, as &s;oon as they &s;aw it, declar'd it the certain Fore|runner of a Storm. However, our Ship kept on its Cour&s;e, before a fine Gale, till we had near pa&s;&s;ed over half the Bay; when, all on a &s;udden, there was &s;uch a hideous Alteration, as makes Nature re|coil on the very Reflection. Tho&s;e Seas that &s;eem'd before to &s;mile upon us, with the A&s;pect of a Friend, now in a Moment
<PB N="346" REF="357">
chang'd their flattering Countenance into that of an open Enemy; and Frowns, the certain Indexes of Wrath, pre&s;ented us with apparent Danger, of which little on this Side Death could be the Sequel. The an|gry Waves ca&s;t them&s;elves up into Mountains, and &s;courg'd the Ship on every Side from Poop to Prow: Such Shocks from the con|tending Wind and Surges! Such Falls from Precipices of Water, to di&s;mal Caverns of the &s;ame uncertain Element! Although the lat|ter &s;eem'd to receive us in Order to skreen us from the Riot of the former, Imagination could offer no other Advantage than that of a Winding-Sheet, pre&s;ented and prepared for our approaching Fate. But why mention I Imagination? In me 'twas wholly dormant. And yet tho&s;e Sons of &s;tormy Weather, the Sailors, had theirs about them in full Stretch; for &s;eeing the Wind and Seas &s;o very boi|&s;terous, they la&s;h'd the Rudder of the Ship, re&s;olv'd to let her drive, and &s;teer her&s;elf; &s;ince it was pa&s;t their Skill to &s;teer her. This was our Way of &s;ojourning mo&s;t Part of that tedious Night; driven where the Winds and Waves thought fit to drive us, with all our Sails quite lower'd and flat upon the Deck. If <HI>Ovid,</HI> in the little <HI>Archipelagian</HI> Sea, could whine out his <HI>jam jam jacturus,</HI> &amp;c. in this more di&s;mal Scene, and much more dange|rous Sea (the Pitch-like Darkne&s;s of the Night adding to all our &s;ad Variety of Woes)
<PB N="347" REF="358">
what Words in Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e could &s;erve to paint our Pa&s;&s;ions, or our Expectations? Alas! our only Expectation was in the Re|turn of Morning: It came at la&s;t; yet even &s;lowly as it came, when come, we thought it come too &s;oon, a new Scene of &s;udden Death being all the Advantage of its fir&s;t Appear|ance. Our Ship was driving full Speed, to|wards the <HI>Breakers</HI> on the <HI>Cabritton</HI> Shore, between <HI>Burdeaux</HI> and <HI>Bayonne</HI>; which fil|led us with Ideas more terrible than all be|fore, &s;ince tho&s;e were pa&s;t, and the&s;e &s;eemingly as certain. Be&s;ide, to add to our Di&s;tre&s;s, the Tide was driving in, and con&s;equently mu&s;t drive us fa&s;t to vi&s;ible De&s;truction. A State &s;o evident, that one of our Sailors, whom great Experience had render'd more &s;en&s;ible of our pre&s;ent Danger, was prepa|ring to &s;ave one, by la&s;hing him&s;elf to the main Ma&s;t, again&s;t the expected Minute of De&s;olation. He was about that melancholy Work, in utter De&s;pair of any better Fortune, when, as loud as ever he could bawl, he cry'd out, <HI>a Point, a Point of Wind.</HI> To me, who had had too much of it, it appear'd like the Sound of the la&s;t Trump; but to the more intelligent Crew, it had a different Sound. With Vi|gour and Alacrity they &s;tarted from their Prayers, or their De&s;pair, and with all ima|ginable Speed, unla&s;h'd the Rudder, and hoi&s;t|ed all their Sails. Never &s;ure in Nature did one Minute produce a greater Scene of
<PB N="348" REF="359">
Contraries. The more skilful Sailors took Courage at this happy Pre&s;age of Delive|rance. And according to their Expecta|tion did it happen; that heavenly Point of Wind deliver'd us from the Jaws of tho&s;e <HI>Breakers,</HI> ready open to devour us; and carrying us out to the much more wellcome wide Sea, furni&s;hed every one in the Ship with Thoughts, as di&s;tant as we thought our Danger.</P>
<P>WE endeavour'd to make <HI>Port Pa&s;&s;age</HI>; but our Ship became unruly, and would not an&s;wer her Helm; for which Rea&s;on we were glad to go before the Wind, and make for the Harbour of <HI>Saint Jean de Luz.</HI> This we attain'd without any great Difficulty, and to the Satisfaction of all, Sailors as well as Pa&s;&s;engers, we there ca&s;t Anchor, after the mo&s;t terrible Storm (as all the olde&s;t Sailors agreed) and as much Danger as ever Peo|ple e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>HERE I took notice, that the Sailors buoy'd up their Cables with Hog&s;heads; enquiring into the Rea&s;on of which, they told me, that the Rocks at the Bottom of the Harbour were by Experience found to be &s;o very &s;harp, that they would other|wi&s;e cut their Cables a&s;under. Our Ship was obliged to be drawn up into the Dock to be refitted; during which, I lay in the Town, where nothing of Moment, or worth reciting, happen'd.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="360">I beg Pardon for my Errors; the very Movements of Princes mu&s;t always be con&s;i|derable, and con&s;equently worth Recital. While the Ship lay in the Dock, I was one Evening walking upon the Bridge, with the little I&s;land near it, (which I have before &s;poke of) and had a little <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dog a|long with me, when at the further End I &s;py'd a Lady, and three or four Gentlemen in Company; I kept on my Pace of Lei&s;ure, and &s;o did they; but when I came nearer, I found they as much out number'd me in the Dog, as they did in the human Kind. And I &s;oon experienced to my Sorrow, that their Dogs, by their Fiercene&s;s and Ill-hu|mour, were Dogs of Quality; having, with|out Warning, or the lea&s;t Declaration of War, fallen upon my little Dog, accord|ing to pri&s;tine Cu&s;tom, without any honou|rable Regard to Size, Intere&s;t or Num|ber. However the good Lady, who, by the Privilege of her Sex, mu&s;t be allow'd the mo&s;t competent Judge of Inequalities, out of an Exce&s;s of Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Good|ne&s;s, came running to the Relief of oppre&s;|&s;ed poor <HI>Tony</HI>; and, in courtly Language, rated her own oppre&s;&s;ive Dogs for their great Incivility to Strangers. The Dogs, in the Middle of their in&s;ulting Wrath, o|bey'd the Lady with a va&s;t deal of profound Submi&s;&s;ion; which I could not much won|der at, when I under&s;tood, that it was a
<PB N="350" REF="361">
Queen Dowager of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had chid them.</P>
<P>Our Ship being now repaired, and made fit to go out again to Sea, we left the Har|bour of <HI>Saint Jean de Luz,</HI> and with a much better Pa&s;&s;age, as the la&s;t Tempe&s;t was &s;till dancing in my Imagination, in ten Days Sail we reach'd <HI>Dover.</HI> Here I land|ed on the la&s;t Day of <HI>March,</HI> 1713. having not, till then, &s;een or touch'd <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shoar from the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1705.</P>
<P>I took Coach directly for <HI>London,</HI> where, when I arriv'd, I thought my &s;elf tran&s;port|ed into a Country more foreign, than any I had either fought or pilgrimag'd in. Not foreign, do I mean, in re&s;pect to others, &s;o much as to it &s;elf. I left it, &s;eemingly, un|der a perfect Unanimity: The fatal Di&s;tin|ctions of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> were then e&s;teemed meerly nominal; and of no more ill Con&s;e|quence or Danger, than a Bee robb'd of its Sting. The national Concern went on with Vigour, and the prodigious Succe&s;s of the Queen's Arms, left every Soul without the lea&s;t Pretence to a Murmur. But now on my Return, I found them on their old E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, perfect Contraries, and as un|likely to be brought to meet as direct An|gles. Some arraigning, &s;ome extolling of a Peace; in which Time has &s;hown both were wrong, and con&s;equently neither could be right in their Notions of it, however an over
<PB N="351" REF="362">
prejudic'd Way of thinking might draw them into one or the other. But <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> are, in my Mind, the compleate&s;t Pa|radox in Nature; and yet like other Para|doxes, old as I am, I live in Hope to &s;ee, before I die, tho&s;e &s;eeming Contraries per|fectly reconcil'd, and reduc'd into one happy Certainty, the Publick Good.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I &s;tay'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> I made &s;eve|ral Vi&s;its to my old Acquaintance General <HI>Mahoni.</HI> I remember that he told me, when the Earl of <HI>Peterborow</HI> and he held a Con|ference at <HI>Morvidro,</HI> his Lord&s;hip u&s;ed many Arguments to induce him to leave the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Service. <HI>Mahoni</HI> made &s;everal Excu&s;es, e&s;pecially that none of his Religion was &s;uf|fer'd to &s;erve in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army. My Lord reply'd, That he would undertake to get him excepted by an Act of Parliament. I have often heard him &s;peak with great Re|&s;pect of his Lord&s;hip, and was &s;trangely &s;ur|prized, that after &s;o many glorious Succe&s;&s;es he &s;hould be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>He was likewi&s;e plea&s;ed to inform me, that at the Battle of <HI>Saragoza,</HI> 'twas his Fortune to make &s;ome of our Hor&s;e to give way, and he pur&s;ued them for a con&s;iderable time; but at his Return, he &s;aw the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army in great Confu&s;ion: But it gave him the Opportunity of attacking our Battery of Guns; which he performed with great

I informed him 'twas Col. <HI>Bourguard,</HI> one that under&s;tood the Oeconomy of the Train exceeding well. As for that, he knew nothing of; but that he would vouch, he behaved him&s;elf with extraordinary Courage, and defended the Battery to the utmo&s;t Extremity, receiving &s;everal Wounds, and de&s;erved the Po&s;t in which he acted.
