<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable Reception my two former Volumes of <HI>Voyages and De&s;criptions</HI> have already met with in the World, gives me Rea&s;on to hope, That notwith|&s;tanding the Objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t me by preju|diced Per&s;ons, this <HI>Third Volume</HI> likewi&s;e may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be acceptable to Candid and Impar|tial Readers, who are curious to know the Nature of the Inhabi|tants, Animals, Plants, Soil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in tho&s;e di&s;tant Countries, which have either &s;eldom or not at all been vi&s;ited by any <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="8">
It has almo&s;t always been the Fate of tho&s;e who have made new Di&s;coveries, to be di&s;e&s;teemed and &s;lightly &s;poken of, by &s;uch as ei|ther have had no true Reli&s;h and Value for the <HI>Things them&s;elves</HI> that are di&s;covered, or have had &s;ome Prejudice again&s;t <HI>the Per&s;ons</HI> by whom the Di&s;coveries were made. It would be vain therefore and un|rea&s;onable in me to expect to e&s;|cape the Cen&s;ure of all, or to hope for better Treatment than far Worthier Per&s;ons have met with before me. But this Satisfaction I am &s;ure of having, that the <HI>Things them&s;elves</HI> in the Di&s;covery of which I have been imployed, are mo&s;t worthy of our Diligente&s;t Search and Inquiry; being the various and wonderful Works of God in different Parts of the World: And however <HI>unfit a Per|&s;on</HI> I may be in other re&s;pects to have undertaken this Task, yet at lea&s;t I have given a faithful Ac|count,
<PB REF="9">
and have found <HI>&s;ome</HI> Things undi&s;covered by any before, and which may at lea&s;t be <HI>&s;ome</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;t|tance and Direction to better qua|lified Per&s;ons who &s;hall come after me.</P>
<P>It has been Objected again&s;t me by &s;ome, that my Accounts and De&s;criptions of Things are dry and jejune, not filled with variety of plea&s;ant Matter, to divert and gra|tify the Curious Reader. How far this is true, I mu&s;t leave to the World to judge. But if I have been exactly and &s;trictly careful to give only <HI>True</HI> Relations and De|&s;criptions of Things (as I am &s;ure I have;) and if my De&s;criptions be &s;uch as may be of u&s;e not only to my &s;elf (which I have already in good mea&s;ure experienced) but al&s;o to others in future Voyages; and likewi&s;e to &s;uch Readers at home as are more de&s;irous of a Plain and Ju&s;t Account of the true Nature and State of the Things
<PB REF="10">
de&s;cribed, than of a Polite and Rhetorical Narrative: I hope all the Defects in my Stile, will meet with an ea&s;y and ready Pardon.</P>
<P>Others have taxed me with bor|rowing from other Men's Journals; and with In&s;ufficiency, as if I was not my &s;elf the Author of what I write, but publi&s;hed Things di|ge&s;ted and drawn up by others. As to the fir&s;t Part of this Obje|ction, I a&s;&s;ure the Reader, I have taken nothing from any Man without mentioning his Name, ex|cept &s;ome very few Relations and particular Ob&s;ervations received from credible Per&s;ons who de&s;ired not to be named; and the&s;e I have always expre&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed in my Books, from what I relate as of my own ob&s;erving. And as to the latter; I think it &s;o far from being a Diminution to one of my Education and Employment, to have what I write, Revi&s;ed and Corrected by Friends; that on the
<PB REF="11">
contrary, the be&s;t and mo&s;t emi|nent Authors are not a&s;hamed to own the &s;ame Thing, and look upon it as an Advantage.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I know there are &s;ome who are apt to &s;light my Accounts and De&s;criptions of Things, as if it was an ea&s;ie Matter and of little or no Difficulty to do all that I have done, to vi&s;it little more than the Coa&s;ts of unknown Countries, and make &s;hort and imperfect Ob|&s;ervations of Things only near the Shore. But whoever is experien|ced in the&s;e Matters, or con&s;iders Things impartially, will be of a very different Opinion. And any one who is &s;en&s;ible, how back|ward and refractory the Seamen are apt to be in long Voyages when they know not whither they are going, how ignorant they are of the Nature of the Winds and the &s;hifting Sea&s;ons of the Mon|&s;oons, and how little even the Of|ficers them&s;elves generally are
<PB REF="12">
skilled in the Variation of the Needle and the U&s;e of the Azi|muth Compa&s;s; be&s;ides the Ha|zard of all outward Accidents in &s;trange and unknown Seas: Any one, I &s;ay, who is &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Difficulties, will be much more plea&s;ed at the Di&s;coveries and Ob|&s;ervations I have been able to make, than di&s;plea&s;ed with me that I did not make more.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e in my own Vindica|tion, again&s;t the Objections that have been made to my former Per|formances. But not to trouble the Reader any further with Matters of this Nature; what I have more to Offer, &s;hall be only in relation to the following Voyage.</P>
<P>For the better apprehending the Cour&s;e of this Voyage, and the Situation of the Places mentioned in it, I have here, as in the former Volumes, cau&s;ed a Map to be In|graven, with a prick'd Line, re|pre&s;enting
<PB REF="13">
to the Eye the whole Thread of the Voyage at one View; be&s;ides Draughts and Fi|gures of particular Places, to make the De&s;criptions I have given of them more intelligible and u&s;e|ful.</P>
<P>Moreover, which I had not the opportunity of doing in my for|mer Voyages; having now had in the Ship with me a Per&s;on skill'd in Drawing, I have by this means been enabled, for the great|er Satisfaction of the Curious Rea|der, to pre&s;ent him with exact Cuts and Figures of &s;everal of the principal and mo&s;t remarkable of tho&s;e Birds, Bea&s;ts, Fi&s;hes and Plants, which are de&s;cribed in the following Narrative; and al&s;o of &s;everal, which not being able to give any better or &s;o good an Ac|count of, as by cau&s;ing them to be exactly Ingraven, the Reader will not find any further De&s;cription of them, but only that they were
<PB REF="14">
found in &s;uch or &s;uch particular Countries. The Plants them&s;elves are in the Hands of the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Woodward.</HI> I could have cau&s;ed ma|ny others to be drawn in like man|ner, but that I re&s;olved to confine my Self to &s;uch only, as had &s;ome very remarkable difference in the &s;hape of their principal Parts from any that are found in <HI>Europe.</HI> I have be&s;ides &s;everal Birds and Fi&s;hes ready drawn, which I could not put into the pre&s;ent Vo|lume, becau&s;e they were found in Countries, to the De&s;cription whereof the following Narrative does not reach. For, being obli|ged to prepare for another Voy|age, &s;ooner than I at fir&s;t expect|ed; I have not been able to Con|tinue the en&s;uing Narrative any further than to my Departure from the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Holland.</HI> But, if it plea&s;e God that I return again &s;afe, the Reader may expect a Continuation of this Voyage from
<PB REF="15">
my departure from <HI>New Holland,</HI> till the foundring of my Ship near the I&s;land of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, to make the Narrative in &s;ome mea&s;ure com|pleat, I &s;hall here add a Summary Ab&s;tract of that latter part of the Voyage, whereof I have not had time to draw out of my Journals a full and particular Account at large. Departing therefore from the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Holland</HI> in the be|ginning of <HI>September,</HI> 1699. (for the Rea&s;ons mentioned <HI>Page</HI> 154.) we arrived at <HI>Tymor, Sept.</HI> 15. and Anchored off that I&s;land. On the 24th we obtain'd a &s;mall Supply of fre&s;h Water from the Governor of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort and Factory there; we found al&s;o there a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Settlement, and were kindly treated by them. On the 3d of <HI>December</HI> we arrived on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Guinea;</HI> where we found good fre&s;h Water, and had Com|merce with the Inhabitants of a
<PB REF="16">
certain I&s;land call'd <HI>Pulo-Sabuti.</HI> After which, pa&s;&s;ing to the North|ward, we ranged along the Coa&s;t to the Ea&s;termo&s;t part of <HI>New Guinea:</HI> which I found does not join to the main Land of <HI>New-Guinea,</HI> but is an I&s;land, as I have de&s;cribed it in my Map, and call'd it <HI>New Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is probable this I&s;land may afford many rich Commodities, and the Natives may be ea&s;ily brought to Commerce. But the many Difficulties I at this time met with, the want of convenience to clean my Ship, the fewne&s;s of my Men, their de&s;ire to ha&s;ten home, and the danger of continu|ing in the&s;e Circum&s;tances in Seas where the Shoals and Coa&s;ts were utterly unknown, and mu&s;t be &s;earched out with much Caution and length of time; hindred me from pro&s;ecuting any further at pre&s;ent my intended Search. What I have been able to do in this Mat|ter
<PB REF="17">
for the Publick Service, will, I hope, be candidly receiv'd; and no Difficulties &s;hall di&s;courage me from endeavouring to promote the &s;ame End, whenever I have an op|portunity put into my Hands.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 18. in our return, we ar|rived again at <HI>Tymor. June</HI> 21, we pa&s;t by part of the I&s;land <HI>Java. July</HI> 4, we anchored in <HI>Batavia</HI>-Road; and I went a&s;hore, vi&s;ited the <HI>Dutch</HI> General, and de&s;ired the Privilege of buying Provi&s;ions that I wanted; which was granted me. In this Road we lay till the 17th of <HI>October</HI> following; when, hav|ing fitted the Ship, recruited my Self with Provi&s;ions, filled all my Water, and the Sea&s;on of the year for returning towards <HI>Europe</HI> being come; I &s;et Sail from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and on the 19th of <HI>December</HI> made the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> whence de|parting <HI>Jan.</HI> 11, we made the I&s;land of <HI>Santa Hellena</HI> on the 31&s;t; and <HI>February</HI> the 21&s;t. the I&s;land
<PB REF="18">
of <HI>A&s;een&s;ion;</HI> near to which my Ship, having &s;prung a Leak which could not be &s;topped, foundred at Sea; With much difficulty we got a&s;hore, where we liv'd on Goats and Turtle; and on the 26th of <HI>February</HI> found, to our great Com|fort, on the S. E. &s;ide of a high Mountain, about half a mile from its top, a Spring of fre&s;h Water. I returned to <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Can|terbury Ea&s;t-India</HI>-Ship. For which wonderful Deliverance from &s;o many and great Dangers, I think my &s;elf bound to return continual Thanks to Almighty God; who&s;e Divine Providence if it &s;hall plea&s;e to bring me &s;afe again to my Na|tive Country from my pre&s;ent in|tended Voyage; I hope to pub|li&s;h a particular Account of all the material Things I ob&s;erved in the &s;everal Places which I have now but barely mentioned.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Sail'd from the <HI>Downs</HI> early on <HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 14. 1698/9. with a fair Wind, in his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Roe-buck;</HI> carrying but 12 Guns in this Voyage, and 50 Men and Boys, with 20 Month's Provi&s;ion. We had &s;everal of the King's Ships in Company, bound for <HI>Spit-head</HI> and <HI>Plimouth;</HI> and by Noon we were off <HI>Dungene&s;s.</HI> We parted from them that Night, and &s;tood down the Channel, but found our Selves next Morning nearer the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t than we expected; C. <HI>de Hague</HI> bearing S. E. and by E. 6 L. There were many other Ships, &s;ome nearer, &s;ome further off the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t, who all
<PB N="3" REF="29">

My Ma&s;ter, who was &s;omewhat troubled at it at fir&s;t, was not di&s;|pleas'd however to find that he had Company in his Mi&s;take: Which, as I have heard, is a very common one, and fatal to many Ships. The Occa&s;ion of it is the not allowing for the Change of the Variation &s;ince the making of the Charts; which Captain <HI>Halley</HI> has ob&s;erv'd to be very con&s;iderable.

<P>Not to trouble the Reader with every Days Run, nor with the Winds or Weather (but only in the remoter Parts, where it may be more particularly u&s;eful) &s;tanding away from C. <HI>la Hague,</HI> we made the <HI>Start</HI> about 5 that Afternoon; which being the la&s;t Land we &s;aw of <HI>England,</HI> we reckon'd our Depar|ture from thence: Tho' we had rather have taken it from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> if the hazy Wea|ther would have &s;uffer'd us to have &s;een it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Land we &s;aw after we were out of the Channel was C. <HI>Fini&s;terre,</HI> which we made on the 19th; and on the 28th made

<P>We were now &s;tanding away for the I&s;land <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> where I intended to take in &s;ome Wine and Brandy for my Voyage. On <HI>Sun|day,</HI> half an hour pa&s;t 3 in the Afternoon, we made the I&s;land, and crouded in with all our Sails till 5; when the N. E. Point of the I&s;le bore W. S. W. di&s;t. 7 Leagues: But being then &s;o far off that I could not expect to get in before Night, I lay by till next Morning, deliberating whether I &s;hould put in at <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> or at <HI>Oratavia,</HI> the one on the E. the other on the W. &s;ide of the I&s;land; which lies mo&s;tly North and South; and the&s;e are the principal Ports on each Side.

<P>In this Road Ships mu&s;t ride in 30, 40, or 50 Fathom-water, not above half a mile from the Shore at &s;arthe&s;t: And if there are many Ships, they mu&s;t ride clo&s;e one by another. The Shore is generally high Land, and in mo&s;t Places &s;teep to. This Road lies &s;o open

to the Ea&s;t, that Winds from that &s;ide make a great Swell, and very bad going a&s;hore in Boats: The Ships that ride here are then of|ten forced to put to Sea, and &s;ometimes to cut or &s;lip their Anchors, not being able to weigh them. The be&s;t and &s;moothe&s;t Land|ing is in a &s;mall &s;andy Cove, about a mile to the N. E. of the Road, where there is good Water, with which Ships that lade here are &s;upply'd; and many times Ships that lade at <HI>Oratavia,</HI> which is the chief Port for Trade, &s;end their Boats hither for Water. That is a wor&s;e Port for We&s;terly than this is for Ea&s;t|erly Winds; and then all Ships that are there put to Sea. Between this Watering-place and <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> are two little Forts; which with &s;ome Batteries &s;catter'd along the Coa&s;t command the Road. <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> its &s;elf is a &s;mall unwalled Town fronting the Sea, guarded with two other Forts to &s;ecure the Road. There are about 200 Hou&s;es in the Town, all 2 Stories high, &s;trongly built with Stone, and covered with Pantile. It hath two Convents and one Church, which are the be&s;t Buildings in the Town. The Forts here could not &s;ecure the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galle|ons from Admiral <HI>Blake,</HI> tho' they hall'd in clo&s;e under the main Fort. Many of the In|habitants that are now living remember that Action; in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> batter'd the Town, and did it much Damage; and the marks of the Shot &s;till remain in the Fort-Walls. The Wrecks of the Galleons that
<PB N="6" REF="33">
were burnt here lie in 15 Fathom-water: And 'tis &s;aid that mo&s;t of the Plate lies there, tho' &s;ome of it was ha&s;tily carried a&s;hore at <HI>Blake</HI>'s coming in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Soon after I had anchor'd I went a&s;hore here to the Governor of the Town, who re|ceived me very kindly and invited me to Dine with him the next day. I return'd on board in the Evening, and went a&s;hore again with two of my Officers the next Morning; hoping to get up the Hill time enough to &s;ee <HI>Laguna,</HI> the principal Town, and to be back again to Dine with the Governor of <HI>Santa Cruz;</HI> for I was told that <HI>Laguna</HI> was but 3 Mile off. The Road is all the way up a pret|ty &s;teep Hill; yet not &s;o &s;teep but that Carts go up and down laden. There are Publick Hou&s;es &s;cattering by the way-&s;ide, where we got &s;ome Wine. The Land on each &s;ide &s;eemed to be but rocky and dry; yet in many Places we &s;aw Spots of green flouri&s;hing Corn. At farther di&s;tances there were &s;mall Vineyards by the Sides of the Mountains, in|termixt with abundance of wa&s;te rocky Land, unfit for Cultivation, which afforded only Dildo-bu&s;hes. It was about 7 or 8 in the Morning when we &s;et out from <HI>Santa Cruz;</HI> and it being fair clear Weather, the Sun &s;hone very bright and warmed us &s;ufficiently be|fore we got to the City <HI>Laguna;</HI> which we reached about 10 a Clock, all &s;weaty and tired, and were glad to refre&s;h our &s;elves with a little Wine in a &s;orry Tipling-hou&s;e:
<PB N="7" REF="34">
But we &s;oon found out one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants that re&s;ided here; who enter|tain'd us hand&s;omly at Dinner, and in the Afternoon &s;hew'd us the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Laguna</HI> is a pretty large well-compacted Town, and makes a very agreeable Pro&s;pect. It &s;tands part of it again&s;t a Hill, and part in a Level. The Hou&s;es have mo&s;tly &s;trong Walls built with Stone and covered with Pantile. They are not uniform, yet they appear plea&s;ant enough. There are many fair Buildings; among which are 2 Pari&s;h-Churches, 2 Nunneries, an Ho&s;pital, 4 Con|vents, and &s;ome Chapels; be&s;ides many Gentlemen's Hou&s;es. The Convents are tho&s;e of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and St. <HI>Diego.</HI> The two Churches have pret|ty high &s;quare Steeples, which top the re&s;t of the Buildings. The Streets are not Regular, yet they are mo&s;tly &s;pacious and pretty hand|&s;ome; and near the middle of the Town is a large Parade, which has good Buildings about it. There is a &s;trong Pri&s;on on one &s;ide of it; near which is a large Conduit of good Water, that &s;upplies all the Town. They have many Gardens which are &s;et round with Oranges, Limes, and other Fruits: In the middle of which are Pot-herbs, Sallading, Flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, indeed, if the Inhabi|tants were curious this way, they might have very plea&s;ant Gardens: For as the Town &s;tands high from the Sea, on the Brow of a Plain that is all open to the Ea&s;t, and
<PB N="8" REF="35">
hath con&s;equently the Benefit of the true Trade-wind, which blows here, and is mo&s;t commonly fair; &s;o there are &s;eldom wanting, at this Town, brisk, cooling, and refre&s;hing Breezes all the Day.</P>
<P>On the back of the Town there is a large Plain of 3 or 4 Leagues in length and 2 Miles wide, producing a thick kindly &s;ort of Gra&s;s, which look'd green and very plea&s;ant when I was there, like our Meadows in <HI>England</HI> in the Spring. On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this Plain, very near the back of the Town, there is a natural Lake or Pond of fre&s;h Water. It is about half a Mile in circumference; but be|ing &s;tagnant, 'tis only us'd for Cattle to drink of. In the Winter-time &s;everal &s;orts of wild Fowl re&s;ort hither, affording plenty of Game to the Inhabitants of <HI>Laguna.</HI> This City is called <HI>Laguna</HI> from hence; for that Word in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ignifies a Lake or Pond. The Plain is bounded on the W. the N. W. and the S. W. with high &s;teep Hills; as high above this Plain as this is above the Sea; and 'tis from the foot of one of the&s;e Mountains that the Water of the Conduit which &s;upplies the Town, is conveyed over the Plain, in Troughs of Stone rais'd upon Pillars. And, indeed, con&s;idering the Situation of the Town, its large Pro&s;pect to the Ea&s;t (for from hence you &s;ee the <HI>Grand Canary</HI>) its Gardens, cool Arbors, plea&s;ant Plain, green Fields, the Pond and Aqueduct, and its refre&s;hing Breezes, it is a very delightful Dwelling;
<PB N="9" REF="36">
e&s;pecially for &s;uch as have not Bu&s;ine&s;s that calls them far and often from home: For the I&s;land being generally Mountainous, &s;teep and craggy, full of Ri&s;ings and Fallings, 'tis very trouble&s;ome Travelling up and down in it, unle&s;s in the Cool of the Mornings and Evenings: And Mules and A&s;&s;es are mo&s;t us'd by them, both for Riding and Carriage, as fitte&s;t for the &s;tony, uneven Roads.</P>
<P>Beyond the Mountains, on the S. W. &s;ide, &s;till further up, you may &s;ee from the Town and Plain a &s;mall peeked Hill, overlooking the re&s;t. This is that which is called the <HI>Pike of Teneriffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;o much noted for its heighth: But we &s;aw it here at &s;o great a di&s;advantage, by rea&s;on of the nearne&s;s of the adjacent Mountains to us, that it looked in|con&s;iderable in re&s;pect to its Fame.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Malme&s;y</HI> Wine grows in this I&s;land; and this here is &s;aid to be the be&s;t of its kind in the World. Here is al&s;o <HI>Canary</HI>-Wine, and <HI>Verdona,</HI> or Green-wine. The <HI>Canary</HI> grows chiefly on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land; and therefore is commonly &s;ent to <HI>Oratavia;</HI> which being the chief Sea-port for Trade in the I&s;land, the principal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants re&s;ide there, with their Con&s;ul; becau&s;e we have a great Trade for this Wine. I was told, That that Town is bigger than <HI>Laguna;</HI> that it has but one Church, but ma|ny Convents: That the Port is but ordinary at be&s;t, and is very bad when the N. W. Winds blow. The&s;e Norwe&s;ters give no|tice

of their coming, by a great Sea that tumbles in on the Shore for &s;ome time before they come, and by a black Sky in the N. W. Upon the&s;e Signs Ships either get up their Anchors, or &s;lip their Cables and put to Sea, and ply off and on till the Weather is over. Sometimes they are forced to do &s;o 2 or 3 times before they can take in their Lad|ing; which 'tis hard to do here in the faire&s;t Weather: And for fre&s;h Water, they &s;end, as I have &s;aid, to <HI>Santa Cruz. Verdona</HI> is green, &s;trong-bodied Wine, har&s;her and &s;harper than <HI>Canary.</HI> 'Tis not &s;o much e|&s;teemed in <HI>Europe,</HI> but is exported to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and will keep be&s;t in hot Countries; for which Rea&s;on I touch'd here to take in &s;ome of it for my Voyage. This &s;ort of Wine is made chiefly on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, and Shipt off at <HI>Santa Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Wines, which are yearly vended in great plenty from the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands (chiefly from <HI>Grand Canary, Teneriffe,</HI> and <HI>Palma</HI>) here is &s;tore of Grain, as Wheat, Bar|ly and Maiz, which they often tran&s;port to other places. They have al&s;o &s;ome Beans and Peas, and Coches, a &s;ort of Grain much like Maiz, &s;ow'd mo&s;tly to &s;atten Land. They have Papah's, which I &s;hall &s;peak more of hereafter; Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Cherries, and excellent Peaches, Apricocks, Guava's, Pomegranates, Citrons, Oranges, Lemons, Limes, Pumpkins, Onions the be&s;t in the World, Cabbages, Turnips, Potato's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

They are al&s;o well &s;tocked with Hor&s;es, Cows, A&s;&s;es, Mules, Sheep, Goats, Hogs, Conies, and plenty of Deer. The <HI>Lancerot</HI> Hor&s;es are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t mettle&s;ome, fleet, and loyal Hor&s;es that are. La&s;tly, here are many Fowls, as Cocks and Hens, Ducks, Pidgeons, Patridges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with plenty of Fi&s;h, as Mackril, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands have of the&s;e Commodities and Provi&s;ions more or le&s;s: But as <HI>Lancerota</HI> is mo&s;t fam'd for Hor|&s;es, and <HI>Grand Canary, Teneriffe,</HI> and <HI>Palma</HI> for Wines, <HI>Teneriffe</HI> e&s;pecially for the be&s;t Malme&s;y, (for which rea&s;on the&s;e 3 I&s;lands have the chief Trade) &s;o is <HI>Forteventura</HI> for Dunghil-Fowls, and <HI>Gomera</HI> for Deer. Fowls and other Eatables are dear on the Trading I&s;lands; but very plentiful and cheap on the other; and therefore 'tis be&s;t for &s;uch Ships as are going out on long Voyages, and who de&s;ign to take in but little Wine, to touch rather at the&s;e la&s;t; where al&s;o they may be &s;upply'd with Wine enough, and good cheap: And for my own part, if I had known it before I came hither, I &s;hould have gone rather to one of tho&s;e I&s;lands than to <HI>Teneriffe:</HI> But enough of this.</P>
<P>'Tis reported they can rai&s;e 12000 armed Men on this I&s;land. The Governor or <HI>Gene|ral</HI> (as he is call'd) of all the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands lives at <HI>Laguna:</HI> His Name is <HI>Don Pedro de Ponto.</HI> He is a Native of this I&s;land, and was not long &s;ince Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama</HI> in the <HI>South Seas;</HI> who bringing &s;ome very rich
<PB N="12" REF="39">
Pearls from thence, which he pre&s;ented to the Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> was therefore, as 'tis &s;aid, made General of the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands. The <HI>Grand Canary</HI> is an I&s;land much &s;uperior to <HI>Teneriffe</HI> both in Bulk and Value; but this Gentleman chu&s;es rather to re&s;ide in this his native I&s;land. He has the Character of a ve|ry worthy Per&s;on; and governs with Mode|ration and Ju&s;tice, being very well be|loved.</P>
<P>One of his Deputies was the Governor of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> with whom I was to have Din'd; but &s;taying &s;o long at <HI>Laguna,</HI> I came but time enough to Sup with him. He is a civil, di&s;creet Man. He re&s;ides in the main Fort clo&s;e by the Sea. There is a Centinel &s;tands at his Door; and he has a few Ser|vants to wait on him. I was Treated in a large dark Lower Room, which has but one &s;mall Window. There were about 200 Mu&s;|kets hung up again&s;t the Walls, and &s;ome Pikes; no Wain&s;cot, Hangings, nor much Furniture. There was only a &s;mall old Table, a few old Chairs, and 2 or 3 pretty long Forms to &s;it on. Having Supp'd with him, I invited him on Board, and went off in my Boat. The next Morning he came aboard with another Gentleman in his Company, attended by 2 Servants: But he was pre&s;ent|ly Sea-&s;ick, and &s;o much out of order that he could &s;carce Eat or Drink any Thing, but went quickly a&s;hore again.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="40">
Having refre&s;h'd my Men a&s;hore, and ta|ken in what we had occa&s;ion for, I Sail'd a|way from <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> on <HI>Feb.</HI> 4. in the After|noon; ha&s;tening out all I could, becau&s;e the N. E. Winds growing &s;tormy made &s;o great Sea, that the Ship was &s;carce &s;afe in the Road; and I was glad to get out, tho' we left behind &s;everal Goods we had bought and paid for: For a Boat could not go a&s;hore; and the &s;tre&s;s was &s;o great in weighing Anchor, that the Cable broke. I de&s;ign'd next for the I. of <HI>Mayo,</HI> one of the <HI>C. Verd</HI> I&s;lands; and ran away with a &s;trong N. E. Wind, right afore it, all that Night and the next Day, at the rate of 10 or 11 Miles an hour; when it &s;lacken'd to a more moderate Gale. The <HI>Ca|nary</HI> I&s;lands are, for their Latitude, within the u&s;ual Verge of the True or General Trade-Wind; which I have ob&s;erv'd to be, on this &s;ide the Equator, N.

but their heighth made it &s;eem the le&s;s con&s;i|derable; for it looks mo&s;t remarkable to Ships that are to the We&s;tward of it. We had brisk N. N. E. and N. E. Winds from <HI>Tene|riffe;</HI> and &s;aw Flying-fi&s;h, and a great deal of Sea-thi&s;tle Weed floating. By the 9th of <HI>Feb.</HI> at Noon we were in the Lat. of 15 d. 4 m. &s;o we &s;teered away W. N.

All the&s;e were great Signs, that we were near &s;ome Land, after having had &s;uch con&s;tant brisk Winds before. In the Morning after Sun|ri&s;e, we &s;aw the I&s;land at about 4 Leagues di&s;tance. But it was &s;o hazy over it, that we could &s;ee but a &s;mall part of it; yet even by that part I knew it to be the I&s;le of <HI>Mayo.</HI> See how it appear'd to us at &s;everal <HI>Views,</HI> as we were compa&s;&s;ing the E. the S.

Shore, in the &s;ame Place where I Anchor'd in my <HI>Voyage round the World;</HI> and found rid|ing here the <HI>Newport of London,</HI> a Merchant Man, Captain <HI>Barefoot</HI> Commander, who welcomed me with 3 Guns, and I returned one for Thanks. He came from <HI>Fayal,</HI> one of the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> I&s;lands; and had &s;tore of Wine and Brandy aboard. He was taking in Salt to carry to <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> and was very glad to &s;ee one of the King's Ships, being before our coming afraid of Pyrates; which, of late Years, had much infe&s;ted this and the re&s;t of the Cape <HI>Verd I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>I have given &s;ome Account of the I&s;land of <HI>Mayo,</HI> and of other of the&s;e I&s;lands, in my <HI>Voyage round the World,</HI> [Vol. I. p. 70.] but I &s;hall now add &s;ome further Ob&s;ervations that occurr'd to me in this Voyage. The I. of <HI>Mayo</HI> is about 7 Leagues in Circumference, of a roundi&s;h Form, with many &s;mall rocky Points &s;hooting out into the Sea a Mile, or more. Its Lat. is 15 d. N. and as you Sail about the I&s;le, when you come pretty nigh the Shore, you will &s;ee the Water breaking off from tho&s;e Points; which you mu&s;t give a Birth to, and avoid them. I Sail'd at this time two parts in three round the I&s;land, but &s;aw nothing dangerous be&s;ides the&s;e Points; and they all &s;hew'd them&s;elves by the Break|ing of the Water: Yet 'tis reported, That on the N. and N. N. W. &s;ide there are dan|gerous Sholes, that ly farther off at Sea; but I was not on that Side. There are 2 Hills
<PB N="16" REF="44">
on this I&s;land of a con&s;iderable heighth; one pretty bluff, the other peeked at top. The re&s;t of the I&s;land is pretty level, and of a good heighth from the Sea. The Shore clear round hath &s;andy Bays, between the Rocky Points I &s;pake of; and the whole I&s;land is a very dry &s;ort of Soil.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;le where the Road for Ships is there is a large Sandy Bay, and a Sand-bank, of about 40 Paces wide within it, which runs along the Shore 2 or 3 Miles; within which there is a large <HI>Salina</HI> or Salt-pond, contained between the Sand-bank and the Hills beyond it. The whole <HI>Salina</HI> is about 2 Miles in length, and half a Mile wide; but above one half of it is com|monly dry. The North end only of the Pond never wants Water, producing Salt from <HI>No|vember</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> which is here the dry Sea&s;on of the Year. The Water which yields this Salt works in from out of the Sea through a hole in the Sand-bank before mentioned, like a Sluce, and that only in Spring-tides; when it fills the Pond more or le&s;s, according to the heighth of the Tides. If there is any Salt in the Ponds when the Flu&s;h of Water comes in, it pre&s;ently di&s;&s;olves: But then in two or three Days after it begins to Kern; and &s;o continues Kerning till either all, or the great|e&s;t part of the Salt-water is congeal'd or kern'd; or till a fre&s;h Supply of it comes in again from the Sea. This Water is known to come in only at that one Pa&s;&s;age on the N.
<PB N="17" REF="45">
part of the Pond; where al&s;o it is deepe&s;t. It was at a Spring of the <HI>New</HI> Moon when I was there; and I was told that it comes in at no other time but at the New Moon Spring-tides: but why that &s;hould be I can't gue&s;s. They who come hither to lade Salt rake it up as it Kerns, and lay it in heaps on the dry Land, before the Wa|ter breaks in anew: And this is ob&s;ervable of this Salt-Pond, that the Salt kerns only in the Dry Sea&s;on, contrary to the Salt-Ponds in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> particularly tho&s;e of the I&s;land <HI>Salt-Tortuga,</HI> which I have formerly mentioned [Vol. I. p. 56.] for they never Kern there till the Rains come in about <HI>April;</HI> and continue to do &s;o in <HI>May, June, July,</HI> &amp;c. while the Wet Sea|&s;on la&s;ts; and not without &s;ome good Shower of Rain fir&s;t: But the Rea&s;on al|&s;o of this Difference between the Salt-Ponds of <HI>Mayo,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> why the&s;e &s;hould Kern in the Wet Sea&s;on, and the former in the Dry S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">on, I &s;hall leave to Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Our Nation drive here a great Trade for Salt, and have commonly a Man of War here for the Guard of our Ships and Barks that come to take it in; of which I have been inform'd that in &s;ome Years there have not been le&s;s than 100 in a Year. It co&s;ts nothing but Men's Labour to rake it together, and wheel it out of the Pond,
<PB N="18" REF="46">
except the Carriage: And that al&s;o is very cheap; the Inhabitants having plenty of A&s;&s;es, for which they have little to do be|&s;ides carrying the Salt from the Ponds to the Sea-tide at the Sea&s;on when Ships are here. The Inhabitants lade and drive their A&s;&s;es them&s;elves, being very glad to be imploy'd; for they have &s;carce any o|ther Trade but this to get a Penny by. The Pond is not above half a Mile from the Landing-place, &s;o that the A&s;&s;es make a great many Trips in a day. They have a &s;et number of Turns to and fro both Forenoon and Afternoon, which their Owners will not exceed. At the Landing-place there lies a <HI>Frape</HI>-boat, as our Seamen call it, to take in the <HI>Salt.</HI> 'Tis made purpo&s;ely for this u&s;e, with a Deck reaching from the Stern a third part of the Boat; where there is a kind of Bulk-head that ri&s;es, not from the Boats bottom, but from the Edge of the Deck, to about 2 foot in heighth; all calk'd very tight. The U&s;e of it is to keep the Waves from da&s;hing into the Boat, when it lies with its Head to the Shore, to take in Salt: For here commonly runs a great Sea; and when the Boat lies &s;o with its Head to the Shore, the Sea breaks in over the Stern, and would &s;oon fill it, was it not for this Bulk-head, which &s;tops the Waves that come flowing upon the Deck,
<PB N="19" REF="47">
and makes them run off into the Sea on each &s;ide. To keep the Boat thus with the Head to the Shore, and the Stern to the Sea, there are two &s;trong Stantions &s;et up in the Boat; the one at the Head, the o|ther in the middle of it, again&s;t the Bulk-head, and a Foot higher than the Bulk-head. There is a large Notch cut in the top of each of the&s;e Stantions big enough for a &s;mall Hazer or Rope to lie in; one end of which is fa&s;ten'd to a Po&s;t a&s;hore, and the other to a Grapling or An|chor lying a pretty way off at Sea: This Rope &s;erveth to hale the Boat in and out, and the Stantions &s;erve to keep her fa&s;t, &s;o that &s;he cannot &s;wing to either &s;ide when the Rope is hal'd tight: For the Sea would el&s;e fill her, or to&s;s her a&s;hore and &s;tave her. The better to prevent her &s;taving and to keep her the tighter together, there are two &s;ets of Ropes more: The fir&s;t go|ing athwart from Gunnal to Gunnal, which, when the Rowers Benches are laid, bind the Boats &s;ides &s;o hard again&s;t the Ends of the Benches that they cannot ea&s;ily fall a&s;under, while the Benches and Ropes mutually help each other; the Ropes keeping the Boats &s;ides from flying off, and the Benches from being cru&s;h'd together inwards. Of the&s;e Ropes there are u&s;ual|ly but two, dividing the Boats length, as they go acro&s;s the Sides, into there equal
<PB N="20" REF="48">
parts. The other &s;et of Ropes are more in number, and are &s;o plac'd as to keep the Ribs and Planks of the Boat from &s;tarting off. For this purpo&s;e there are holes made at certain di&s;tances through the Edge of the Keel that runs along on the in&s;ide of the Boat; through which the&s;e Ropes pa&s;|&s;ing are laid along the Ribs, &s;o as to line them, or be them&s;elves as Ribs upon them, being made fa&s;t to them by Rattan's brought thither, or &s;mall Cords twi&s;ted clo&s;e about both Ropes and Ribs, up to the Gunnal: By which means tho' &s;everal of the Nails or Pegs of the Boat &s;hould by any &s;hock fall out, yet the Ropes of the&s;e two &s;ets might hold her together: E&s;pe|cially with the help of a Rope going quite round about the Gunnal on the out-&s;ide, as our Long-boats have. And &s;uch is the Care taken to &s;trengthen the Boats; from which girding them with Ropes, which our Seamen call <HI>Fraping,</HI> they have the Name of Frape-boats. Two Men &s;uffice to hale her in and out, and take in the Salt from Shore (which is brought in Bags) and put it out again. As &s;oon as the Boat is brought nigh enough to the Shore, he who &s;tands by the Bulk-head takes in&s;tantly a turn with the Hazer about the Bulk-head-Stantion; and that &s;tops her fa&s;t before the Sea can turn her a&s;ide: And when the two Men have got in their Lad|ing,
<PB N="21" REF="49">
they hale off to Sea, till they come a little without the &s;well; where they re|move the Salt into another Boat that car|ries it on board the Ship. Without &s;uch a <HI>Frape</HI>-boat here is but bad Landing at any time: for tho' 'tis commonly very &s;mooth in the Road, yet there falls a great Sea on the Shore, &s;o that every Ship that comes here &s;hould have &s;uch a <HI>Boat,</HI> and bring, or make, or borrow one of other Ships that happen to be here; for the Inhabi|tants have none. I have been thus parti|cular in the De&s;cription of the&s;e <HI>Frape</HI>-boats, becau&s;e of the U&s;e they may be of in any Places where a great Sea falls in upon the Shore; as it doth e&s;pecially in many open Roads in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies;</HI> where they might therefore be very &s;er|viceable; but I never &s;aw any of them there.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Mayo</HI> is generally barren, be|ing dry, as I &s;aid; and the be&s;t of it is but a very indifferent Soil. The &s;andy Bank that pens in the Salt-pond hath a &s;ort of Silk Cotton growing upon it, and a Plant that runs along upon the Ground, branch|ing out like a Vine, but with thick broad Leaves. The Silk-Cotton grows on ten|der Shrubs, 3 or 4 Foot high, in Cods as big as an Apple, but of a long &s;hape; which when ripe open at one end, parting lei&s;ure|ly into 4 quarters; and at the fir&s;t open|ing
<PB N="22" REF="50">
the Cotton breaks forth. It may be of u&s;e for &s;tuffing of Pillows, or the like; but el&s;e is of no value, any more than that of the great Cotton-tree. I took of the&s;e Cods before they were quite ripe, and laid them in my Che&s;t; and in two or three days they would open and throw out the Cotton. Others I have bound fa&s;t with Strings, &s;o that the Cod could not open; and in a few Days after, as &s;oon as I &s;lack|ned the String never &s;o little, the Cod would bur&s;t, and the Cotton fly out force|ably, at a very little hole, ju&s;t as the Pulp out of a roa&s;ting Apple, till all has been out of the Cod. I met with this &s;ort of Cotton afterwards at <HI>Timor</HI> (where it was ripe in <HI>November</HI>) and no where el&s;e in all my Travels; but I found two o|ther &s;orts of Silk-cotton at <HI>Brazil,</HI> which I &s;hall there de&s;cribe. The right Cotton-Shrub grows here al&s;o, but not on the Sand-bank. I &s;aw &s;ome Bu&s;hes of it near the Shore; but the mo&s;t of it is planted in the middle of the I&s;le, where the Inhabi|tants live, Cotton-cloth being their chief Manufacture; but neither is there any great &s;tore of this Cotton. There al&s;o are &s;ome Trees within the I&s;land, but none to be &s;een near the Sea-&s;ide; nothing but a few Bu&s;hes &s;cattering up and down again&s;t the &s;ides of the adjacent Hills; for, as I &s;aid before, the Land is pretty high from
<PB N="23" REF="51">
the Sea. The Soil is for the mo&s;t part either a &s;ort of Sand, or loo&s;e crumbling Stone, without any fre&s;h Water Ponds or Streams, to moi&s;ten it; but only Showers in the Wet-&s;ea&s;on, which run off as fa&s;t as they fall: except a &s;mall Spring in the middle of the I&s;le, from which proceeds a little Stream of Water that runs through a Valley between the Hills. There the Inhabitants live in three &s;mall Towns, hav|ing a Church and Padre in each Town: And the&s;e Towns, as I was inform'd, are 6 or 7 miles from the Road. <HI>Pino&s;e</HI> is &s;aid to be the chief Town, and to have two Churches: St. <HI>Johns</HI> the next; and the third <HI>Lagoa.</HI> The Hou&s;es are very mean; &s;mall, low Things. They build with Fig-tree; here being, as I was told, no other Trees fit to build with. The Raf|ters are a &s;ort of wild Cane. The Fruits of this I&s;le are chiefly Figs, and Water-Melons. They have al&s;o <HI>Callavances</HI> (a &s;ort of Pul&s;e like <HI>French</HI> Beans) and Pump|kins, for ordinary Food. The Fowls are Flamingo's, Great Curlews, and <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens; which the Natives of tho&s;e I&s;lands call <HI>Gallena Pintada,</HI> or the Painted Hen; but in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where I have &s;een al&s;o tho&s;e Birds in the dry Savannah's and Woods, (for they love to run about in &s;uch Places) they are call'd <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens. They &s;eem to be much of the Nature of Partridges.
<PB N="24" REF="52">
They are bigger than our Hens, have long Legs, and will run apace. They can fly too, but not far, having large heavy Bodies, and but &s;hort Wings, and &s;hort Tails: As I have generally ob&s;erv'd that Birds have &s;eldom long Tails unle&s;s &s;uch as fly much; in which their Tails are u&s;ual|ly &s;erviceable to their turning about, as a Rudder to a Ship or Boat. The&s;e Birds have thick and &s;trong, yet &s;harp Bills, pretty long Claws, and &s;hort Tails. They feed on the Ground, either on Worms, which they find by tearing open the Earth; or on Gra&s;hoppers, which are plentiful here. The Feathers of the&s;e Birds are &s;peckled with dark and light Gray; the spots &s;o regular and uniform, that they look more beautiful than many Birds that are deck'd with gayer Feathers. Their Necks are &s;mall and long; their Heads al&s;o but little. The Cocks have a &s;mall ri&s;ing on their Crowns, like a &s;ort of a Comb. 'Tis of the colour of a dry Wall Nut-&s;hell, and very hard. They have a &s;mall red Gill on each &s;ide of their Heads, like Ears, &s;trutting out downwards; but the Hens have none. They are &s;o &s;trong that one cannot hold them; and very hardy. They are very good Meat, ten|der, and &s;weet; and in &s;ome the Fle&s;h is extraordinary white; tho' &s;ome others have black Fle&s;h: but both &s;orts are very
<PB N="25" REF="53">
good. The Natives take them with Dogs, running them down whenever they plea&s;e; for here are abundance of them. You &s;hall &s;ee 2 or 300 in a company. I had &s;everal brought aboard alive, where they throve very well; &s;ome of them 16 or 18 Months; when they began to pine. When they are taken young they will become tame like our Hens. The <HI>Flamingo</HI>'s I have already de&s;crib'd at large, [Vol. I. p. 79.] They have al&s;o many other &s;ort of Fowls, <HI>viz.</HI> Pidgeons and Turtle-doves; <HI>Miniota</HI>'s, a &s;ort of Land-fowls as big as Crows, of a grey colour, and good Food; <HI>Cru&s;ia</HI>'s, another &s;ort of grey-colour'd Fowl almo&s;t as big as a Crow, which are only &s;een in the Night (probably a &s;ort of Owls) and are &s;aid to be good for con|&s;umptive People, but eaten by none el&s;e. <HI>Rabek</HI>'s, a &s;ort of large grey eatable Fowls with long Necks and Legs, not unlike Herons; and many kinds of &s;mall Bitds.</P>
<P>Of Land-Animals, here are Goats, as I &s;aid formerly, and A&s;&s;es good &s;tore. When I was here before they were &s;aid to have had a great many Bulls and Cows: But the Pirates, who have &s;ince mi&s;erably infe&s;ted all the&s;e I&s;lands, have much le&s;&s;en'd the number of tho&s;e; not having &s;par'd the Inhabitants them|&s;elves: for at my being there this time the
<PB N="26" REF="54">
Governor of <HI>Mayo</HI> was but newly return'd from being a Pri&s;oner among them, they having taken him away, and carried him about with them for a Year or two.</P>
<P>The Sea is plentifully &s;tock'd with Fi&s;h of divers &s;orts, <HI>viz.</HI> Dolphins, Boneta's, Mullets, Snappers, Silver-fi&s;h, Garfi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and here is a good Bay to hale a Sain or Net in. I hal'd mine &s;everal times, and to good purpo&s;e; dragging a&s;hore at one time 6 dozen of great Fi&s;h, mo&s;t of them large Mullets of a foot and a half or two foot long. Here are al&s;o Porpo&s;es, and a &s;mall &s;ort of Whales, that common|ly vi&s;it this Road every day. I have al|ready &s;aid, [Vol. I. p. 75.] That the Months of <HI>May, June, July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> (that is, the Wet Sea&s;on) are the time, when the Green Turtle come hither, and go a&s;hore to lay their Eggs. I look upon it as a thing worth taking Notice of, that the Turtle &s;hould always, both in North and South Latitude, lay their Eggs in the Wet Months. It might be thought, con|&s;idering what great Rains there are then in &s;ome places where the&s;e Creatures lay, that their Eggs &s;hould be &s;poiled by them. But the Rain, tho' violent, is &s;oon &s;oaked up by the Sand, wherein the Eggs are buri|ed; and perhaps &s;inks not &s;o deep into it as the Eggs are laid: And keeping down the Heat may make the Sand hotter below
<PB N="27" REF="55">
than it was before, like a Hot-bed. What|ever the Rea&s;on may be why Providence determines the&s;e Creatures to this Sea&s;on of laying their Eggs, rather than the Dry, in Fact it is &s;o, as I have con&s;tantly ob|&s;erv'd; and that not only with the Sea-Turtle, but with all other &s;orts of Amphi|bious Animals that lay Eggs; as Croco|dils, Alligator's, Guano's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The In|habitants of this I&s;land, even their Gover|nour and <HI>Padre</HI>'s, are all Negro's, Wool|pated like their <HI>African</HI>-Neighbours; from whom 'tis like they are de&s;cended; tho' being Subjects to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> they have their Religion and Language. They are &s;tout, lu&s;ty, well-limb'd People, both Men and Women, fat and fle&s;hy; and they and their Children as round and plump as little Porpo&s;es; tho' the I&s;land appears &s;o barren to a Stranger as &s;carce to have Food for its Inhabitants. I inquired how many People there might be on the I&s;le; And was told by one of the <HI>Padre</HI>'s, that here were 230 Souls in all. The Negro-Governor has his Patent from the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Governor of St. <HI>Jago.</HI> He is a very civil and &s;en&s;ible poor Man; and they are generally a good &s;ort of People. He ex|pects a &s;mall Pre&s;ent from every Com|mander that lades Salt here; and is glad to be invited aboard their Ships. He &s;pends mo&s;t of his time with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the
<PB N="28" REF="56">
Salting Sea&s;on, which is his Harve&s;t; and indeed, all the I&s;landers are then fully em|ployed in getting &s;omewhat; for they have no Ve&s;&s;els of their own to Trade with, nor do any Portugue&s;e-Ve&s;&s;els come hither: &s;carce any but <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on whom they depend for Trade; and tho' Subjects of <HI>Portugal,</HI> have a particular Value for us. We don't pay them for their Salt, but for the Labour of them&s;elves and their Bea&s;ts in lading it: for which we give them Vi|ctuals, &s;ome Mony, and old Cloaths, <HI>viz.</HI> Hats, Shirts, and other Cloaths: by which means many of them are indifferently well rigg'd; but &s;ome of them go almo&s;t Naked. When the Turtle-&s;ea&s;on comes in they watch the Sandy-bays in the Night, to turn them; and having &s;mall Huts at par|ticular Places on the Bays to keep them from the Rain, and to &s;leep in: And this is another Harve&s;t they have for Food; for by Report there come a great many Tur|tle to this and the re&s;t of the <HI>Cape Verd I&s;lands.</HI> When the Turtle Sea&s;on is over they have little to do but to hunt for <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens, and manage their &s;mall Plan|tations. But by the&s;e means they have all the Year &s;ome Employment or other; whereby they get a Sub&s;i&s;tence, tho' but little el&s;e. When any of them are de&s;irous to go over to St. <HI>Jago</HI> they get a Licence from the Governor, and de&s;ire pa&s;&s;age in
<PB N="29" REF="57">
any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship that is going thither: And indeed all Ships that lade Salt here will be obliged to touch at St. <HI>Jago</HI> for Water, for here at the Bay is none, not &s;o much as for Drinking. 'Tis true there is a &s;mall Well of bracki&s;h Water not half a mile from the Landing-place, which the A&s;&s;es that carry Salt drink at; but 'tis very bad Water. A&s;&s;es them&s;elves are a Com|modity in &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands, &s;everal of our Ships coming hither purpo&s;ely to freight with them, and carry them to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and our other Plantations. I &s;tay'd at <HI>Mayo</HI> 6 days, and got 7 or 8 Tun of Salt aboard for my Voyage: In which time there came al&s;o into this Road &s;everal Sail of Merchants Ships for Salt; all bound with it for <HI>Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P>The 19th day of <HI>February,</HI> at about One a Clock in the Morning I weighed from <HI>Mayo</HI>-Road, in order to Water at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which was about 5 or 6 Leagues to the We&s;tward. We coa&s;ted along the I&s;land <HI>St. Jago,</HI> and pa&s;t by the Port on the Ea&s;t of it, I mention'd formerly [Vol. I. p. 76.] which they call <HI>Praya;</HI> where &s;ome Eng|li&s;h outward-bound <HI>East-India</HI> Men &s;till touch, but not &s;o many of them as hereto|fore. We &s;aw the Fort upon the Hill, the Hou&s;es and Coco-nut Trees: But I would not go in to anchor here, becau&s;e I expe|cted better Water on the S. W. of the
<PB N="30" REF="58">
I&s;land, at St. <HI>Jago</HI> Town. By 8 a Clock in the Morning we &s;aw the Ships in that Road, being within 3 Leagues of it: But were forc'd to keep Turning many hours to get in, the Flaws of Wind coming &s;o uncertain; as they do e&s;pecially to the <HI>Lee|ward</HI> of I&s;lands that are High Land. At length two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> boats came off to help tow us in; and about 3 a Clock in the Afternoon we came to an Anchor; and took the Pro&s;pect of the Town, [Table II. N^o. 5.] We found here, be|&s;ides two <HI>Portugue&s;e-Ships</HI> bound for <HI>Brazil,</HI> who&s;e Boats had tow'd us in; an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pink that had taken in A&s;&s;es at one of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and was bound to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with them. Next Morning I went A&s;hore with my Officers to the Governor, who treated us with Sweet-meats: I told him, the occa|&s;ion of my coming was chiefly for Water; and that I de&s;ired al&s;o to take in &s;ome Re|fre&s;hments of Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He &s;aid I was welcom, and that he would order the Town&s;men to bring their Commodities to a certain Hou&s;e, where I might purcha&s;e what I had occa&s;ion for: I told him I had not Mony, but would exchange &s;ome of the Salt which I brought from <HI>Mayo</HI> for their Commodities. He reply'd, that Salt was indeed an acceptable Commodity with the poor People, but that if I de&s;ign'd to
<PB N="31" REF="59">
buy any Cattle, I mu&s;t give Mony for them. I contented my &s;elf with taking in Dunghil Fowls: The Governor ordering a Cryer to go about the Town and give notice to the People, that they might repair to &s;uch a place with Fowls, and Maiz for feeding them, where they might get Salt in exchange for them: So I &s;ent on board for Salt, and ordered &s;ome of my Men to truck the &s;ame for the Fowls and Maiz, while the re&s;t of them were bu&s;ie in filling of Wa|ter. This is the effect of their keeping no Boats of their own on the &s;everal I&s;lands, that they are glad to buy even their own Salt of Foreigners, for want of being able to tran&s;port it them&s;elves from I&s;land to I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>St. Jago</HI> Town lies on the S. W. part of the I&s;land, in Lat. about 15 Deg. N. and is the Seat of the General Governour, and of the Bi&s;hop of all the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands. This Town &s;tands &s;cattering a|gain&s;t the &s;ides of two Mountains, be|tween which there is a deep Valley, which is about 200 Yards wide again&s;t the Sea; but within a quarter of a mile it clo&s;es up &s;o as not to be 40 Yards wide. In the Valley, by the Sea, there is a &s;tragling Street, Hou&s;es on each &s;ide, and a Run of Water in the bottom, which empties it &s;elf into a fine &s;mall Cove or &s;andy Bay, where the Sea is commonly very &s;mooth:
<PB N="32" REF="60">
&s;o that here is good Wat'ring and good Landing at any time; tho' the Road be rocky and bad for Ships. Ju&s;t by the Landing-place there is a &s;mall Fort, almo&s;t level with the Sea, where is always a Court of Guard kept. On the top of the Hill, above the Town, there is another Fort; which, by the Wall that is to be &s;een from the Road, &s;eems to be a large Place. They have Canon mounted there, but how many I know not: Neither what u&s;e that Fort can be of, except it be for Sa|lutes. The Town may con&s;i&s;t of 2 or 300 Hou&s;es, all built of rough Stone; having al&s;o one Convent, and one Church.</P>
<P>The People in general are black, or at lea&s;t of a mixt colour, except only &s;ome few of the better &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> the Governor, the Bi&s;hop, &s;ome Gentlemen, and &s;ome of the Padres; for &s;ome of the&s;e al&s;o are black.

Their chief Fruits are, (be&s;ides Plantains in abundance) Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, Melons, (both Musk and Water-melons) Limes, Guava's, Pom|granates, Quinces, Cu&s;tard-Apples, and Papah's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Cu&s;tard-Apple (as we call it) is a Fruit as big as a <HI>Pomegranate,</HI> and much of the &s;ame colour. The out-&s;ide Husk, Shell or Rind, is for &s;ub&s;tance and thick|ne&s;s between the Shell of a Pomegranate, and the Peel of a <HI>Sevil</HI>-Orange; &s;ofter than this, yet more brittle than that. The Coat or Covering is al&s;o remarkable in that it is be&s;et round with &s;mall regular Knobs or Ri&s;ings; and the in&s;ide of the Fruit is full of a white &s;oft Pulp, &s;weet and very plea&s;ant, and mo&s;t re&s;embling a Cu&s;tard of any thing, both in Colour and Ta&s;t: From whence probably it is called a Cu&s;tard-Apple by our <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It has in the mid|dle
<PB N="34" REF="62">
a few &s;mall black Stones or Kernels; but no Core, for 'tis all Pulp. The Tree that bears this Fruit is about the bigne&s;s of a Quince-tree, with long, &s;mall, and thick|&s;et Branches &s;pread much abroad: At the Extremity of here and there one of which the Fruit grows upon a Stalk of its own about 9 or 10 Inches long, &s;lender and tough, and hanging down with its own weight. A large Tree of this &s;ort does not bear u&s;ually above 20 or 30 Apples; &s;el|dom more. This Fruit grows in mo&s;t Countries within the <HI>Tropicks.</HI> I have &s;een of them (tho' I omitted the De&s;cri|ption of them before) all over the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> both Continent and I&s;lands; as al|&s;o in <HI>Brazil,</HI> and in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Papah</HI> too is found in all the&s;e Countries, though I have not hitherto de|&s;crib'd it. It is a Fruit about the bigne&s;s of a Musk-Melon, hollow as that is, and much re&s;embling it in Shape and Colour, both out&s;ide and in&s;ide: Only in the mid|dle, in&s;tead of flat Kernels, which the Me|lons have, the&s;e have a handful of &s;mall blacki&s;h Seeds, about the bigne&s;s of Pep|per-corns; who&s;e Ta&s;te is al&s;o hot on the Tongue &s;omewhat like Pepper. The Fruit it &s;elf is &s;weet, &s;oft and lu&s;cious, when ripe; but while green 'tis hard and un|favory: tho' even then being boiled and eaten with Salt-pork or Beef, it &s;erves in|&s;tead
<PB N="35" REF="63">
of Turnips, and is as much e&s;teemed. The Papah-Tree is about 10 or 12 Foot high. The Body near the Ground may be a Foot and an half or 2 Foot Diameter; and it grows up tapering to the top. It has no Branches at all, but only large Leaves growing immediately upon Stalks from the Body. The Leaves are of a roundi&s;h Form and jag'd about the Edges, having their Stalks or Stumps longer or &s;horter as they grow near or further from the top. They begin to &s;pring from out of the Body of the Tree at about 6 or 7 Foot heighth from the Ground, the Trunk being bare below: but above that the Leaves grow thicker and larger &s;till to|wards its Top, where they are clo&s;e and broad. The Fruit grows only among the Leaves; and thicke&s;t among the thicke&s;t of them; in&s;omuch that towards the top of the Tree the <HI>Papah</HI>'s &s;prings forth from its Body as thick as they can &s;tick one by another. But then lower down, where the Leaves are thinner, the Fruit is larger, and of the &s;ize I have de&s;crib'd: And at the Top, where they are thick, they are but &s;mall, and no bigger than ordinary Turnips; yet ta&s;ted like the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Their chief Land-Animals are their Bullocks; which are &s;aid to be many; tho' they askt us 20 Dollars apiece for them: They have al&s;o Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="36" REF="64">
Mules, Deer, Goats, Hogs, and black|fac'd long-tail'd Monkeys. Of Fowls they have Cocks and Hens, Ducks, <HI>Guinea</HI>-Hens, both tame and wild, Parakites, Parrots, Pidgeons, Turtle-Doves, Herons, Hawks, Crab-catchers, Galdens, (a larger &s;ort of Crab-catchers) Curlew's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Fi&s;h is the &s;ame as at <HI>Mayo</HI> and the re&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands, and for the mo&s;t part the&s;e I&s;lands have the &s;ame Bea&s;ts and Birds al&s;o: But &s;ome of the I&s;les have Pa&s;turage and Employment for &s;ome particular Bea&s;ts more than other; and the Birds are in|courag'd, by Woods for &s;helter, and Maiz and Fruits &s;or Food, to flock rather to &s;ome of the I&s;lands (as to this of St. <HI>Jago</HI>) than to others.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago</HI> Road is one of the wor&s;t that I have been in. There is not clean Ground enough for above 3 Ships; and tho&s;e al&s;o mu&s;t lie very near each other.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving di&s;patch'd my &s;mall Affairs at the <HI>C. Verd</HI> I&s;lands, I meditated on the proce&s;s of my Voyage. I thought it requi&s;ite to touch once more at a cultivated Place in the&s;e Seas, where my Men might be refre&s;h'd, and might have a Market wherein to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Ne|ce&s;&s;aries: For de&s;igning that my next Stretch &s;hould be quite to <HI>N. Holland,</HI> and knowing that after &s;o long a Run nothing was to be expected there but fre&s;h Water, if I could meet even with that there, I re|&s;olved upon putting in fir&s;t at &s;ome Port of <HI>Brazil,</HI> and to provide my Self there with whatever I might have further Oc|ca&s;ion for. Be&s;ide the refre&s;hing and fur|ni&s;hing my Men, I aim'd al&s;o at the inuring them gradually and by intervals to the Fa|tigues that were to be expected in the re|mainder of the Voyage, which was to be in a part of the World they were altogether Strangers to; none of them, except two young Men, having ever cro&s;st the <HI>Line.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="69">
With this De&s;ign I &s;ail'd from <HI>St. Jago</HI> on the 22d of <HI>February,</HI> with the Winds at E. N. E. and N. E. fair Weather, and a brisk Gale. We &s;teered away S. S. E. and S. S. E. half Ea&s;t, till in the Lat. of 7 deg. 50 min. we met with many Rip|lings in the Sea like a Tide or &s;trong Cur|rent, which &s;etting again&s;t the Wind caus'd &s;uch a Ripling. We continu'd to meet the&s;e Currents from that Lat. till we came into the Lat. of 3 deg. 22 N. when they cea&s;ed. During this time we &s;aw &s;ome Boneta's, and Sharks; catching one of the&s;e. We had the true General Trade-Wind blowing fre&s;h at N. E. till in the Lat. of 4 deg. 40 min. N. when the Wind varied, and we had &s;mall Gales, with &s;ome Tornadoes. We were then to the Ea&s;t of <HI>St. Jago</HI> 4 deg. 54 min. when we got into Lat. 3 deg. 2 min. N. (where I &s;aid the Ripling ceas'd) and Long. to the Ea&s;t of <HI>St. Jago</HI> 5 deg. 2 min. we had the Wind whiffling between the S. by E. and E. by N. &s;mall Gales, frequent Calms, very black Clouds, with much Rain. In the Lat. of 3 deg. 8 min. N. and Long. E. from <HI>St. Jago</HI> 5 deg. 8 min. we had the Wind from the S. S. E. to the N. N. E. faint, and often interrupted with Calms. While we had Calms we had the opportu|nity of trying the Current we had met with hitherto, and found that it &s;et N. E.
<PB N="42" REF="70">
by E. half a Knot, which is 12 mile in 24 hours: So that here it ran at the Rate of half a mile an hour, and had been much &s;tronger before. The Rains held us by intervals till the Lat. of 1 deg. 0 min. N. with &s;mall Gales of Wind between S. S. E. and S. E. by E. and &s;ometimes calm: Af|terwards we had the Wind between the S. &amp; S. S. E. till we cro&s;st the Line, &s;mall Winds, Calms, and pretty fair Weather. We &s;aw but few Fi&s;h be&s;ide Porpo&s;es; but of them a great many, and &s;truck one of them.</P>
<P>It was the 10th day of <HI>March,</HI> about the time of the <HI>Equinox,</HI> when we cro&s;st the <HI>Equator,</HI> having had all along from the Lat. of 4 deg. 40 min. N. where the True Trade-Wind left us, a great &s;well out of the S. E. and but &s;mall uncertain Gales, mo&s;tly Southerly, &s;o that we crept to the Southward but &s;lowly. I kept up again&s;t the&s;e as well as I could to the Southward, and when we had now and then a flurry of Wind at E. I &s;till went away due South, purpo&s;ely to get to the Southward as fa&s;t as I could; for while near the <HI>Line</HI> I expe|cted to have but uncertain Winds, fre|quent Calms, Rains, Tornadoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which would not only retard my Cour&s;e, but endanger Sickne&s;s al&s;o among my Men: e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were ill provided with Cloaths, or were too lazy to &s;hift them|&s;elves
<PB N="43" REF="71">
when they were drench'd with the Rains. The Heat of the Weather made them carele&s;s of doing this; but taking a Dram of Brandy, which I gave them when wet, with a Charge to &s;hift them&s;elves, they would however lie down in their Hammocks with their Wet Cloaths; &s;o that when they turn'd out they caus'd an ill &s;mell where-ever they came, and their Ham|mocks would &s;tink &s;ufficiently: that I think the Remedying of this is worth the Care of Commanders that cro&s;s the <HI>Line;</HI> e&s;pecially when they are, it may be, a Month or more e'er they get out of the Rains, at &s;ome times of the Year, as in <HI>June, July,</HI> or <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>What I have here &s;aid about the Cur|rents, Winds, Calms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this Pa&s;&s;age is chiefly for the farther Illu&s;tration of what I have heretofore ob&s;erv'd in general about the&s;e Matters, and e&s;pecially as to Cro&s;&s;ing the Line, in my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of the Winds,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in the Torrid Zone:</HI> [See Vol. II. Part 3. p. 5, 6.] Which Ob&s;ervations I have had very much confirm'd to me in the Cour&s;e of this Voyage; and I &s;hall particularize in &s;everal of the chief of them as they come in my Way. And indeed I think I may &s;ay this of the Main of the Ob&s;ervations in that <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> that the clear Satisfaction I had about them, and how much I might rely upon them, was a great Ea&s;e to my
<PB N="44" REF="72">
Mind during this Vexatious Voyage; wherein the Ignorance, and Ob&s;tinacy withal, of &s;ome under me, occa&s;ion'd me a great deal of Tronble: tho' they found all along, and were often forc'd to acknow|ledge it, that I was &s;eldom out in my Con|jectures, when I told them u&s;ually before|hand what Winds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we &s;hould meet with at &s;uch or &s;uch particular Places we &s;hould come at.</P>
<P><HI>Pernambuc</HI> was the Port that I de&s;igned for at my fir&s;t &s;etting out from <HI>St. Jago;</HI> it being a Place mo&s;t proper for my purpo&s;e, by rea&s;on of its Situation, lying near the Extremity of <HI>C. St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> the Ea&s;tern|mo&s;t Promontory of <HI>Brazil;</HI> by which means it not only enjoys the greater bene|fit of the Sea-breezes, and is con&s;equently more healthy than other Places to the Southward, but is withal le&s;s &s;ubject to the Southerly Coa&s;ting-Trade-winds, that blow half the Year on this Shore; which were now drawing on, and might be trouble&s;ome to me: So that I might both hope to reach &s;oone&s;t <HI>Pernambuc,</HI> as mo&s;t directly and neare&s;t in my Run; and might thence al&s;o more ea&s;ily get away to the Southward than from <HI>Bahia de Todos los Santos,</HI> or <HI>Ria Janeira.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Advantages I propos'd to my &s;elf in going to <HI>Pernambuc,</HI> I was &s;oon put by that De&s;ign through the
<PB N="45" REF="73">
refractorine&s;s of &s;ome under me, and the Di&s;contents and Backwardne&s;s of &s;ome of my Men. For the Calms and Shiftings of Wind which I met with, as I was to expect, in cro&s;&s;ing the Line, made them, who were un|acquainted with the&s;e Matters, almo&s;t heartle&s;s as to the per&s;uit of the Voyage, as thinking we &s;hould never be able to weather C. <HI>St. Augu&s;tine:</HI> And though I told them that by that time we &s;hould get to about three Degrees South of the Line, we &s;hould again have a True brisk General Trade-Wind from the North Ea&s;t, that would carry us to what part of <HI>Brazil</HI> we pleas'd, yet they would not believe it till they found it &s;o. This, with &s;ome other un|fore&s;een Accidents, not nece&s;&s;ary to be mention'd in this place, meeting with the Aver&s;ion of my Men to a long unknown Voyage, made me ju&s;tly ap|prehen&s;ive of their Revolting, and was a great Trouble and Hindrance to me. So that I was obliged partly to alter my Mea&s;ures, and met with ma|ny Difficulties, the Particulars of which I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with: But I mention thus much of it in ge|neral for my own nece&s;&s;ary Vindica|tion,
<PB N="46" REF="74">
in my taking &s;uch Mea&s;ures &s;ome|times for pro&s;ecuting the Voyage as the &s;tate of my Ships Crew, rather than my own Judgment and Experience, de|termin'd me to. The Di&s;orders of my Ship made me think at pre&s;ent that <HI>Pernambuc</HI> would not be &s;o fit a Place for me; being told that Ships ride there two or three Leagues from the Town, under the Command of no Forts; &s;o that whenever I &s;hould have been a|&s;hore it might have been ea&s;y for my di&s;contented Crew to have cut or &s;lipt their Cables, and have gone away from me: Many of them di&s;covering already an Intention to return to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome of them declaring openly that they would go no further onwards than <HI>Brazil.</HI> I alter'd my Cour&s;e therefore, and &s;tood away for <HI>Bahio de todos los Santos,</HI> or the <HI>Bay of All Saints,</HI> where I hop'd to have the Governor's help, if need &s;hould require, for &s;ecuring my Ship from any &s;uch Mutinous Attempt; be|ing forc'd to keep my &s;elf all the way upon my Guard, and to lie with my Of|ficers, &s;uch as I could tru&s;t, and with &s;mall Arms, upon the Quarter-deck; it &s;carce being &s;afe for me to lie in my Cabbin, by Rea&s;on of the Di&s;contents among my Men.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="75">
On the 23d of <HI>March</HI> we &s;aw the Land of <HI>Brazil;</HI> having had thither, from the time when we came into the True Trade-Wind again after cro&s;&s;ing the Line, very fair Weather and brisk Gales, mo&s;tly at E.

This Coa&s;t is rather low than high, with Sandy-Bays all along by the Sea.</P>
<P>A little within Land are many very white Spots of Sand, appearing like Snow; and the Coa&s;t looks very plea&s;ant, being checker'd with Woods and Savanahs. The Trees in general are not tall; but they are green and flouri&s;hing. There are ma|ny &s;mall Hou&s;es by the Sea-&s;ide, who&s;e In|habitants are chiefly Fi&s;hermen. They come off to Sea on Barklogs, made of &s;eve|ral Logs fa&s;ten'd &s;ide to &s;ide, that have one or two Ma&s;ts with Sails to them.

Many of the&s;e were a Fi&s;hing now, and two of them came aboard, of whom I bought &s;ome Fi&s;h.

<P>I coa&s;ted along till the Evening, and then brought to, and lay by till the next Morning. About 2 hours after we were brought to, there came a Sail out of the Offin (from Seaward) and lay by about a Mile to Windward of us, and &s;o lay all Night. In the Morning, upon &s;peaking with her, &s;he proved to be a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship bound to <HI>Bahia;</HI> therefore I &s;ent my Boat aboard and de&s;ired to have one of his Mates to Pilot me in: He an&s;wer'd, That he had not a Mate capable of it, but that he would &s;ail in before me, and &s;hew me the way; and that if he went in to the Harbour in the Night, he would hang out a Light for me. He &s;aid we had not far in and might reach it before Night with a tolerable Gale; but that with &s;o &s;mall an one as now we had we could not do it: So we jog'd on till Night, and then he ac|cordingly hung out his Light, which we &s;teered after, &s;ounding as we went in. I kept all my Men on Deck, and had an Anchor ready to let go on occa&s;ion.

<P><HI>Bahia de todos los Santos</HI> lies in Lat. 13 deg. S. It is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Town in <HI>Brazil,</HI> whether in re&s;pect of the Beauty of its Buildings, its Bulk, or its Trade and Revenue. It has the convenience of a
<PB N="50" REF="79">
good Harbour that is capable of receiving Ships of the greate&s;t Burthen: The En|trance of which is guarded with a &s;trong Fort &s;tanding without the Harbour, call'd <HI>St. Antonio:</HI> A Sight of which I have gi|ven [Table III. N^o. 4.] as it appear'd to us the Afternoon before we came in; and its Lights (which they hang out purpo&s;e|ly for Ships) we &s;aw the &s;ame Night. There are other &s;maller Forts that com|mand the Harbour, one of which &s;tands on a Rock in the Sea, about half a mile from the Shore. Clo&s;e by this Fort all Ships mu&s;t pa&s;s that anchor here, and mu&s;t ride al&s;o within half a mile of it at farthe&s;t between this and another Fort (that &s;tands on a Point at the inner part of the Har|bour and is called the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort) but mu&s;t ride neare&s;t to the former, all along again&s;t the Town: where there is good holding Ground, and le&s;s expo&s;ed to the Southerly Winds that blow very hard here. They commonly &s;et in about <HI>April,</HI> but blow harde&s;t in <HI>May, June, July</HI> and <HI>August:</HI> but the Place where the Ships ride is ex|po&s;ed to the&s;e Winds not above 3 Points of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e there is another Fort front|ing the Harbour, and &s;tanding on the Hill upon which the Town &s;tands. The Town it &s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of about 2000 Hou&s;es; the major part of which cannot be &s;een
<PB N="51" REF="80">
from the Harbour: but &s;o many as appear in &s;ight, with a great mixture of Trees be|tween them, and all placed on a ri&s;ing Hill, make a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect; as may be judg'd by the Draught, [Table III. N^o. 5.]</P>
<P>There are in the Town 13 Churches, Chapels, Ho&s;pitals, Convents, be&s;ide one Nunnery; <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Eccle&s;ia Major</HI> or Ca|thedral, the Je&s;uits College, which are the chief, and both in &s;ight from the Har|bour: <HI>St. Antonio, Sta. Barbara,</HI> both Pa|ri&s;h-Churches; the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> Church, and the <HI>Dominicans;</HI> and two Convents of <HI>Carmelites;</HI> a Chapel for Seamen clo&s;e by the Sea-&s;ide, where Boats commonly land, and the Seamen go immediately to Prayers; another Chapel for poor People, at the farther end of the &s;ame Street, which runs along by the Shore; and a third Chapel for Soldiers, at the edge of the Town, remote from the Sea; and an Ho&s;pital in the middle of the Town. The Nunnery &s;tands at the outer-edge of the Town next the Fields, wherein by Report there are 70 Nuns. Here lives an Arch|bi&s;hop who has a fine Palace in the Town; and the Governor's Palace is a fair Stone-building, and looks hand&s;ome to the Sea, tho' but indifferently furni&s;h'd with|in: both <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in their Plantations abroad, as I have generally
<PB N="52" REF="81">
ob&s;erv'd, affecting to have large Hou&s;es; but are little curious about Furniture, ex|cept Pictures &s;ome of them. The Hou&s;es of the Town are 2 or 3 Stories high, the Walls thick and &s;trong, being built with Stone, with a Covering of Pantile; and many of them have Balconies. The prin|cipal Streets are large, and all of them pav'd or pitch'd with &s;mall Stones. There are al&s;o Parades in the mo&s;t eminent Places of the Town, and many Gardens, as well within the Town as in the Out-parts of it, wherein are Fruit-trees, Herbs, Salladings and Flowers in great variety, but order'd with no great Care nor Art.</P>
<P>The Governor who re&s;ides here is call'd <HI>Don John de Lanca&s;tario,</HI> being de&s;cended, as they &s;ay, from our <HI>Engli&s;h Lanca&s;ter</HI> Fa|mily; and he has a re&s;pect for our Nation on that account, calling them his Country|men. I waited on him &s;everal times and always found him very courteous and civil. Here are about 400 Soldiers in Gari&s;on. They commonly draw up and exerci&s;e in a large Parade before the Governor's Hou&s;e; and many of them attend him when he goes abroad. The Soldiers are decently clad in brown Linen, which in the&s;e hot Countries is &s;ar better than Woollen; but I never &s;aw any clad in Linen but only the&s;e. Be&s;ide the Soldiers in Pay, he can &s;oon have &s;ome thou&s;ands of Men up in
<PB N="53" REF="82">
Arms on occa&s;ion. The Magazine is on the Skirts of the Town, on a &s;mall ri&s;ing between the Nunnery and the Soldiers Church. 'Tis big enough to hold 2 or 3000 Barrels of Powder; but I was told it &s;eldom has more than 100, &s;ometimes but 80. There are always a Band of Soldiers to guard it, and Centinels looking out both Day and Night.</P>
<P>A great many Merchants always re&s;ide at <HI>Bahia;</HI> for 'tis a Place of great Trade: I found here above 30 great Ships from <HI>Europe,</HI> with two of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Ships of War for their Convoy; be&s;ide two Ships that Traded to <HI>Africa</HI> only, either to <HI>Angola, Gamba,</HI> or other Places on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and abundance of &s;mall Craft, that only run to and fro on this Coa&s;t, carrying Commodities from one part of <HI>Brazil</HI> to another.</P>
<P>The Merchants that live here are &s;aid to be Rich, and to have many <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves in their Hou&s;es, both of Men and Women. Them&s;elves are chiefly <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> Foreigners having but little Com|merce with them; yet here was one Mr. <HI>Cock</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, a very civil Gentleman and of good Repute. He had a Patent to be our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul, but did not care to take upon him any Publick Character, becau&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships &s;eldom come hither, here having been none in 11
<PB N="54" REF="83">
or 12 years before this time. Here was al&s;o a <HI>Dane,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Merchant or two; but all have their Effects tran&s;ported to and from <HI>Europe</HI> in <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships, none of any other Nation being admitted to Trade hither. There is a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e by the Sea-&s;ide, where all Goods imported or exported are entred. And to prevent Abu&s;es there are 5 or 6 Boats that take their turns to row about the Harbour, &s;earching any Boats they &s;u&s;pect to be run|ning of Goods.</P>
<P>The chief Commodities that the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Ships bring hither, are Linnen|cloaths, both cour&s;e and fine; &s;ome Wool|lens al&s;o, as Bays, Searges, Perpetuana's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hats, Stockings, both of Silk and Thread, Bisket-bread, Wheat-flower, Wine (chiefly <HI>Port</HI>) Oil-Olive, Butter, Chee&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Salt-beef and Pork would there al&s;o be good Commodities. They bring hither al&s;o Iron, and all &s;orts of Iron-Tools; Pewter-Ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts, as Di&s;hes, Plates, Spoons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Looking|gla&s;&s;es, Beads, and other Toys; and the Ships that touch at <HI>St. Jago</HI> bring thence, as I &s;aid, Cotton cloath, which is after|wards &s;ent to <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Ships carry from hence Sugar, Tobacco, either in Roll or Snuff, never in Leaf, that I know of: The&s;e are the Staple Commodities. Be&s;ides which,
<PB N="55" REF="84">
here are Dye-woods, as Fu&s;tick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Woods for other u&s;es, as &s;peckled Wood, <HI>Brazil,</HI> &amp;c. They al&s;o carry home raw Hides, Tallow, Train-Oil of Whales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here are al&s;o kept tame Monkeys, Parrots, Parakites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the Seamen carry home.</P>
<P>The Sugar of this Country is much bet|ter than that which we bring home from our Plantations: for all the Sugar that is made here is clay'd, which makes it whiter and finer than our <HI>Mu&s;covada,</HI> as we call our unrefin'd Sugar. Our Planters &s;eldom refine any with Clay, unle&s;s &s;ometimes a little to &s;end home as Pre&s;ents for their Friends in <HI>England.</HI> Their way of doing it is by taking &s;ome of the white&s;t Clay and mixing it with Water, 'till 'tis like Cream. With this they fill up the Pans of Sugar, that are &s;unk 2 or 3 Inches below the Brim by the draining of the Molo&s;&s;es out of it: Fir&s;t &s;craping off the thin hard Cru&s;t of the Sugar that lies at the top, and would hinder the Water of the Clay from &s;oak|ing through the Sugar of the Pan. The refining is made by this Percolation. For 10 or 12 days time that the Clayi&s;h Li|quor lies &s;oaking down the Pan, the white Water whitens the Sugar as it pa&s;&s;es thro' it; and the gro&s;s Body of the Clay it &s;elf grows hard on the top, and may be taken off at plea&s;ure; when &s;craping off with a
<PB N="56" REF="85">
Knife the very upper part of the Sugar, which will be a little &s;ullied, that which is underneath will be White almo&s;t to the bottom: and &s;uch as is called <HI>Brazil</HI> Sugar is thus Whitened. When I was here this Sugar was &s;old for 50 <HI>s. per</HI> 100 <ABBR>lb</ABBR>. and the Bottoms of the Pots, which is very cour&s;e Sugar, for about 20 <HI>s. per</HI> 100 <ABBR>lb</ABBR>. both &s;orts being then &s;carce; for here was not enough to lade the Ships, and therefore &s;ome of them were to lie here till the next Sea|&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Ships commonly arrive here in <HI>February</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> and they have generally quick Pa&s;&s;ages; finding at that time of the Year brisk Gales to bring them to the Line, little Trouble, then, in cro&s;|&s;ing it, and brisk E. N. E. Winds after|wards to bring them hither. They com|monly return from hence about the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> or in <HI>June.</HI> 'Twas &s;aid when I was here that the Ships would &s;ail hence the 20th day of <HI>May;</HI> and therefore they were all very bu&s;y, &s;ome in taking in their Goods, others in Careening and making them&s;elves ready. The Ships that come hither u&s;ually Careen at their fir&s;t coming; here being a Hulk belonging to the King for that purpo&s;e. This Hulk is under the charge of the Superintendent I &s;poke of, who has a certain Sum of Mony for every Ship that Careens by her. He al&s;o pro|vides
<PB N="57" REF="86">
Firing and other Nece&s;&s;aries for that purpo&s;e: and the Ships do commonly hire of the Merchants here each 2 Cables to moor by all the time they lie here, and &s;o &s;ave their own Hempen Cables; for the&s;e are made of a &s;ort of Hair, that grows on a certain kind of Trees, hanging down from the Top of their Bodies, and is very like the black <HI>Coyre</HI> in the <HI>East-In|dies,</HI> if not the &s;ame. The&s;e Cables are &s;trong and la&s;ting: And &s;o much for the <HI>European</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>The Ships that u&s;e the <HI>Guinea</HI>-Trade are &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els in compari&s;on of the for|mer. They carry out from hence Rum, Sugar, the Cotton-cloaths of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and bring in return, Gold, Ivory, and Slaves; making very good re|turns.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Craft that belong to this Town are chiefly imployed in carrying <HI>European</HI> Goods from <HI>Bahia,</HI> the Center of the <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> Trade, to the other Places on this Coa&s;t; bringing back hither Sugar, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are &s;ailed chiefly with Negro-Slaves; and about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> the&s;e are mo&s;tly imployed in Whale-kill|ing: for about that time of the Year a &s;ort Whales, as they call them, are very thick on this Coa&s;t. They come in al&s;o into the Harbours and inland Lakes, where the Seamen go out and kill them. The Fat of
<PB N="58" REF="87">
them is boyled to Oyl; the Lean is eaten by the Slaves and poor People: And I was told by one that had frequently eaten of it that the Fle&s;h was very &s;weet and whole|&s;ome. The&s;e are &s;aid to be but &s;mall Whales: yet here are &s;o many, and &s;o ea&s;ily kill'd, that they get a great deal of Mony by it. Tho&s;e that &s;trike them buy their Licence for it of the King: And I was informed that he receives 30000 Dol|lars <HI>per Annum</HI> for this Fi&s;hery. All the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els that u&s;e this Coa&s;ting Traf|fick are built here; and &s;o are &s;ome Men of War al&s;o for the King'sService. There was one a Building when I was here, a Ship of 40 or 50 Guns: And the Timber of this Country is very good and proper for this purpo&s;e. I was told it was very &s;trong, and more durable than any we have in <HI>Europe:</HI> and they have enough of it. As for their Ships that u&s;e the <HI>European</HI> Trade, &s;ome of them that I &s;aw there were <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> built, taken from us by the <HI>French</HI> dur|ing the late War, and &s;old by them to the <HI>Portuge&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides Merchants and others that Trade by Sea from this Port, here are other pret|ty Wealthy Men, and &s;everal Artificers and Trades-men of mo&s;t &s;orts, who by Labour and Indu&s;try maintain them&s;elves very well; e&s;pecially &s;uch as can arrive at the purcha&s;e of a <HI>Negro</HI>-Slave or two.
<PB N="59" REF="88">
And indeed, excepting People of the low|e&s;t degree of all, here are &s;carce any but what keep Slaves in their Hou&s;es. The Richer Sort, be&s;ides the Slaves of both Sexes whom they keep for &s;ervile U&s;es in their Hou&s;es, have Men-&s;laves who wait on them abroad, for State; either run|ning by their Hor&s;es-&s;ides when they ride out, or to carry them to and fro on their Shoulders in the Town when they make &s;hort Vi&s;its near home. Every Gen|tleman or Merchant is provided with Things nece&s;&s;ary for this &s;ort of Carriage. The main Thing is a pretty large Cotton Hammock of the <HI>West-India</HI> Fa&s;hion, but mo&s;tly dyed Blue, with large Fringes of the &s;ame, hanging down on each &s;ide. This is carry'd on the <HI>Negro</HI>'s Shoulders by the help of a Bambo about 12 or 14 Foot long, to which the Hammock is hung; and a Covering comes over the Pole, hanging down on each &s;ide like a Curtain: So that the Per&s;on &s;o carry'd cannot be &s;een unle&s;s he plea&s;es; but may either ly down, hav|ing Pillows for his Head; or may &s;it up by being a little &s;upported with the&s;e Pil|lows, and by letting both his Legs hang out over one &s;ide of the Hammock. When he hath a mind to be &s;een he puts by his Curtain, and &s;alutes every one of his Ac|quaintance whom he meets in the Streets: for they take a piece of Pride in greeting
<PB N="60" REF="89">
one another from their Hammocks, and will hold long Conferences thus in the Streets: But then their two Slaves who carry the Hammock have each a &s;trong well-made Staff, with a fine Iron Fork at the upper end, and a &s;harp Iron below, like the Re&s;t for a Musket, which they &s;tick fa&s;t in the Ground, and let the Pole or Bambo of the Hammock re&s;t upon them, till their Ma&s;ters Bu&s;ine&s;s or the Complement is over. There is &s;carce a Man of any fa&s;hion, e&s;pecially a Woman, will pa&s;s the Streets but &s;o carried in a Hammock. The chief Mechanick Traders here, are Smiths, Hatters, Shoemakers, Tanners, Sawyers, Carpenters, Coopers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here are al&s;o Taylors, Butchers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which la&s;t kill the Bullocks very dexte|rou&s;ly, &s;ticking them at one Blow with a &s;harp-pointed Knife in the Nape of the Neck, having fir&s;t drawn them clo&s;e to a Rail; but they dre&s;s them very &s;lovenly. It being <HI>Lent</HI> when I came hither there was no buying any Fle&s;h till <HI>Ea&s;ter-Eve,</HI> when a great number of Bullocks were kill'd at once in the Slaughter-hou&s;es with|in the Town, Men, Women and Children flocking thither with great Joy to buy, and a multitude of Dogs, almo&s;t &s;tarv'd, following them; for whom the Meat &s;eem'd fitte&s;t, it was &s;o Lean. All the&s;e Trades-men buy <HI>Negro</HI>'s, and train
<PB N="61" REF="90">
them up to their &s;everal Imployments, which is a great help to them: and they having &s;o frequent Trade to <HI>Angola,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> they have a con&s;tant &s;upply of Blacks both for their Plantations and Town. The&s;e Slaves are very u&s;eful in this Place for Carriage, as Porters; for as here is a great Trade by Sea, and the Landing-place is at the foot of a Hill, too &s;teep for drawing with Carts, &s;o there is great need of Slaves to carry Goods up in|to the Town, e&s;pecially for the inferiour &s;ort: but the Merchants have al&s;o the Convenience of a great Crane that goes with Ropes or Pullees, one end of which goes up while the other goes down. The Hou&s;e in which this Crane is &s;tands on the Brow of the Hill towards the Sea, hanging over the Precipice: and there are Planks &s;et &s;helving again&s;t the Bank from thence to the Bottom, again&s;t which the Goods lean or &s;lide as they are hoi&s;ted up or let down. The <HI>Negro</HI>-Slaves in this Town are &s;o nu|merous, that they make up the greate&s;t part or bulk of the Inhabitants: Every Hou&s;e, as I &s;aid, having &s;ome, both Men and Women, of them. Many of the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> who are Batchelors, keep of the&s;e black Women for Mi&s;&s;es, tho' they know the danger they are in of being poy&s;on'd by them, if ever they give them any occa|&s;ion of Jealou&s;y. A Gentleman of my Ac|quaintance,
<PB N="62" REF="91">
who had been familiar with his Cook-maid, lay under &s;ome &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions from her when I was there. The&s;e Slaves al&s;o of either Sex will ea&s;ily be engaged to do any &s;ort of Mi&s;chief; even to Murder, if they are hired to do it, e&s;pecially in the Night: for which Rea&s;on, I kept my Men on board as much as I could; for one of the <HI>French</HI> King's Ships being here had &s;everal Men murder'd by them in the Night, as I was credibly in|form'd.</P>
<P>Having given this account of the Town of <HI>Bahia,</HI> I &s;hall next &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Country. There is a Salt-water Lake runs 40 Leagues, as I was told, up the Country, N. W. from the Sea, leaving the Town and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort on the Star|board fide. The Country all round a|bout is for the mo&s;t part a pretty flat e|ven Ground, not high, nor yet very low: It is well watered with Rivers, Brooks and Springs, neither wants it for good Harbours, Navigable Creeks, and good Bays for Ships to ride in. The Soil in general is good, naturally producing very latge Trees of divers &s;orts, and fit for any u&s;es. The Savannahs al&s;o are loaden with Gra&s;s, Herbs, and many &s;orts of &s;maller Vegetables; and being cultivated, produce any thing that is proper for tho&s;e hot Countrys, as Sugar-Canes, Cotton, Indi|co,
<PB N="63" REF="92">
Tobacco, Maiz, Fruit-Trees of &s;eve|ral kinds, and Eatable Roots of all &s;orts. Of the &s;everal kinds of Trees that are here, I &s;hall give an account of &s;ome, as I had it partly from an Inhabitant of <HI>Bahia,</HI> and partly from my knowledge of them other|wi&s;e, <HI>viz. Sapiera, Vermiatico, Come&s;&s;e|rie, Guitteba, Serrie,</HI> as they were pronounc'd to me, three &s;orts of <HI>Mangrove,</HI> &s;peckled Wood, Fu&s;tick, Cotton-Trees of three &s;orts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with Fruit-Trees of divers &s;orts that grow wild, be&s;ide &s;uch as are planted.</P>
<P>Of Timber-Trees, the <HI>Sapiera</HI> is &s;aid to be large and tall; it is very good Timber, and is made u&s;e of in building of Hou&s;es; &s;o is the <HI>Vermiatico,</HI> a tall &s;treight-bodied Tree, of which they make Plank 2 Foot broad, and they al&s;o make Canoa's with it. <HI>Come&s;&s;erie</HI> and <HI>Guitteba</HI> are chie&s;ly u|&s;ed in building Ships; the&s;e are as much e&s;teemed here, as Oaks are in <HI>England,</HI> and they &s;ay either &s;ort is harder and more durable than Oak. The <HI>Serrie</HI> is a &s;ort of Tree much like Elm, very durable in water. Here are al&s;o all the three &s;orts of <HI>Mangrove</HI> Trees, <HI>viz.</HI> the Red, the White, and the Black, which I have de|&s;cribed [<HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 54.] The Bark of the Red Mangrove, is here u&s;ed for Tanning of Leather, and they have great Tan-pits for it. The Black Mangrove grows lar|ger
<PB N="64" REF="93">
here than in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and of it they make good Plank. The White Mangrove is larger and tougher than in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> of the&s;e they make Ma&s;ts and Yards for Barks.</P>
<P>There grow here Wild or Ba&s;tard Co|co Nut Trees, neither &s;o large nor &s;o tall as the common ones in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> They bear Nuts as the others, but not a quarter &s;o big as the right Coco-Nuts. The &s;hell is full of Kernel, with|out any hollow Place or Water in it; and the Kernel is &s;weet and whole&s;ome, but very hard both for the Teeth and for Di|ge&s;tion. The&s;e Nuts are in much e&s;teem for making Beads for <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI>'s, Boles of Tobacco-pipes, and other Toys: and every &s;mall Shop here has a great many of them to &s;ell. At the top of the&s;e Ba&s;tard Coco-trees, among the Branches, there grows a &s;ort of long black Thread like Hor&s;e-hair, but much longer, which by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> is called <HI>Tre&s;abo.</HI> Of this they make Cables which are very &s;ervice|able, &s;trong and la&s;ting; for they will not rot as Cables made of Hemp, tho' they ly expo&s;ed both to Wet and Heat. The&s;e are the Cables which I &s;aid they keep in their Harbours here, to let to hire to <HI>European</HI> Ships, and re&s;emble the <HI>Coyre</HI>-Cables.</P>
<P>Here are three &s;orts of Cotton Trees that bear Silk-cotton. One &s;ort is &s;uch as I
<PB N="65" REF="94">
have formerly de&s;cribed, [Vol. I. p. 165.] by the Name of the Cotton-tree. The other two &s;orts I never &s;aw any where but here. The Trees of the&s;e latter &s;orts are but &s;mall in compari&s;on of the former, which are reckon'd the bigge&s;t in all the <HI>West-India</HI> Woods; yet are however of a good bigne&s;s and heighth. One of the&s;e la&s;t &s;orts is not &s;o full of Branches as the other of them; neither do they produce their Fruit the &s;ame time of the Year: for one &s;ort had its Fruit ju&s;t ripe, and was &s;hedding its Leaves while the other &s;ort was yet green, and its Fruit &s;mall and growing, having but newly done blo&s;&s;om|ing; the Tree being as full of young Fruit as an Apple-Tree ordinarily in <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t yield very large Pods, about 6 inches long, and as big as a Man's Arm. It is ripe in <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October;</HI> then the Pod opens, and the Cotton bur&s;ts out in a great Lump as big as a Man's Head. They gather the&s;e Pods before they open: otherways it would fly all away. It opens as well after 'tis gathered; and then they take out the Cotton, and pre&s;erve it to &s;ill Pillows and Bol&s;ters, for which u&s;e 'tis very much e&s;teemed: but 'tis fit for no|thing el&s;e, being &s;o &s;hort that it cannot be &s;pun. 'Tis of a tawney Colour; and the Seeds are black, very round, and as big as a white Pea. The other &s;ort is ripe
<PB N="66" REF="95">
in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April.</HI> The Fruit or Pod is like a large Apple, and very round. The out-&s;ide Shell is as thick as the top of ones Finger. Within this there is a very thin whiti&s;h Bag or Skin which inclo&s;eth the Cotton. When the Cotton-Apple is ripe the outer thick green Shell &s;plits it &s;elf into 5 equal parts from Stemb to Tail, and drops off, leaving the Cotton hanging upon the Stemb, only pent up in its fine Bag. A day or two afterwards the Cotton &s;wells by the heat of the Sun, breaks the Bag and bur&s;ts out, as big as a Man's Head: And then as the Wind blows 'tis by degrees driven away, a little at a time, out of the Bag that &s;till hangs upon the Stemb, and is &s;catter'd about the Fields; the Bag &s;oon following the Cotton, and the Stemb the Bag. Here is al&s;o a little of the right <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Cotton Shrub; but none of the Cotton is exported, nor do they make much Cloth of it.</P>

The Pulp is very juicy, of a plea&s;ant Ta&s;te, and whole&s;ome. You &s;uck the Juice out of the Pulp, and &s;o &s;pit it out. The Tree or Shrub that bears this Fruit grows about 10 or 12 Foot high, with a &s;mall &s;hort Body; the Branches growing pretty &s;trait up; for I did never &s;ee any of them &s;pread abroad.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY &s;tay here at <HI>Bahia</HI> was about a Month: during which time the Vice Roy of <HI>Goa</HI> came hither from thence in a great Ship, &s;aid to be richly laden with all &s;orts of <HI>India</HI> Goods; but &s;he did not break Bulk here, being bound home for <HI>Lisbon:</HI> only the Vice-Roy intended to re|fre&s;h his Men (of whom he had lo&s;t many, and mo&s;t of the re&s;t were very &s;ickly, having been 4 Months in their Voyage hi|ther) and &s;o to take in Water, and depart for <HI>Europe,</HI> in Company with the other
<PB N="85" REF="114">
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships thither Bound; who had Orders to be ready to Sail by the twentieth of <HI>May.</HI> He de&s;ir'd me to car|ry a Letter for him, directed to his Suc|ce&s;&s;or, the new Vice-Roy of <HI>Goa:</HI> Which I did; &s;ending it thither afterwards by Captain <HI>Hammond,</HI> whom I found near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> The Refre&s;h|ing my Men, and taking in Water, was the main al&s;o of my Bu&s;ine&s;s here; be|&s;ide the having the better opportuni|ty to compo&s;e the Di&s;orders among my Crew: Which, as I have before relat|ed, were grown to &s;o great a Heighth, that they could not without great Dif|ficulty be appea&s;ed: However, finding Opportunity, during my &s;tay in this Place, to allay in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Ferment that had been rai&s;ed among my Men, I now &s;et my &s;elf to provide for the car|rying on of my Voyage with more Heart than before, and put all Hands to work, in order to it, as fa&s;t as the backwardne&s;s of my Men would per|mit; who &s;hew'd continually their un|willingne&s;s to proceed farther. Be&s;ides, their Heads were generally fill'd with &s;trange Notions of Southerly Winds that were now &s;etting in (and there had been already &s;ome Flurries of them)
<PB N="86" REF="115">
which, as they &s;urmiz'd, would hinder any farther Attempts of going on to the Southward, &s;o long as they &s;hould la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Winds begin to &s;hift here in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> and the Sea&s;ons of the Year (the Dry and the Wet) alter with them. In <HI>April</HI> the Southerly Winds make their entrance on this Coa&s;t, bringing in the Wet Sea&s;on, with violent Tornado's, Thunder and Light|ning, and much Rain. In <HI>September</HI> the other Coa&s;ting Trade, at Ea&s;t North Ea&s;t comes in, and clears the Sky, bring|ing fair Weather. This, as to the change of Wind, is what I have ob&s;erv'd Vol. II. Part 3. p. 19. but as to the change of Weather accompanying it &s;o exactly here at <HI>Bahia,</HI> this is a particular Excep|tion to what I have Experienc'd in all other Places of South Latitudes that I have been in between the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> or tho&s;e I have heard of; for there the Dry Sea&s;ons &s;ets in, in <HI>April,</HI> and the Wet about <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> &s;ooner or later (as I have &s;aid that they are, in South Latitudes, the Rever&s;e of the Sea&s;ons, or Weather, in the &s;ame Months in N. La|titudes Vol. II. Part 3. p. 77.) whereas on this Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> the Wet Sea&s;on
<PB N="87" REF="116">
comes in in <HI>April,</HI> at the &s;ame time that it doth in N. Latitudes, and the Dry (as I have &s;aid here) in <HI>September;</HI> the Rains here not la&s;ting &s;o far in the year as in o|ther Places: for in <HI>September</HI> the Weather is u&s;ually &s;o fair, that in the latter part of that Month they begin to cut their Su|gar-Canes here, as I was told; for I en|quired particularly about the Sea&s;ons: Though this, as to the Sea&s;on of cut|ting of Canes, which I was now a&s;|&s;ur'd to be in <HI>September,</HI> agrees not very well with what I was formerly told [Vol. II. Part 3. p. 82.] that in <HI>Brazil</HI> they cut the Canes in <HI>July.</HI> And &s;o, as to what is &s;aid a little lower in the &s;ame Page, that in managing their Canes they are not confin'd to the Sea&s;ons, this ought to have been expre&s;s'd only of Planting them; for they never cut them but in the Dry Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>But to return to the Southerly Winds, which came in (as I expected they would) while I was here: The&s;e daunted my Ship's Company very much, tho' I had told them they were to look for them: But they being ignorant as to what I told them farther, that the&s;e were only Coa&s;t|ing-Winds, &s;weeping the Shore to about 40 or 50 Leagues in breadth from it; and imagining that they had blown &s;o all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ea over, between <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="117">
and being confirm'd in this their Opinion by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Pilots of the <HI>European</HI> Ships, with whom &s;everal of my Officers conver&s;ed much, and who were them|&s;elves as ignorant that the&s;e were only Coa&s;ting Trade-Winds (them&s;elves going away before them, in their return home|wards, till they cro&s;s the Line, and &s;o ha|ving no experience of the Breadth of them) being thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Conceit that we could not Sail from hence till <HI>September;</HI> this made them &s;till the more remi&s;s in their Duties, and very li&s;tle&s;s to the get|ting Things in a readine&s;s for our Depar|ture. However I was the more diligent my Self to have the Ship &s;crub'd, and to &s;end my Water-Casks a&s;hore to get them trim'd, my Beer being now out. I went al&s;o to the Governor to get my Water fill'd; &s;or here being but one Watering-place (and the Water running low, now at the end of the Dry Sea&s;on) it was al|ways &s;o crouded with the <HI>European</HI> Ships Boats, who were preparing to be gone, that my Men could &s;eldom come nigh it, till the Governor very kindly &s;ent an Of|ficer to clear the Water-place for my Men, and to &s;tay there till my Wates-Casks were all full, whom I &s;atisfied &s;or his Pains. Here I al&s;o got Aboard 9 or 10 Tun of Balla&s;t, and made my Boat&s;wain fit the
<PB N="89" REF="118">
Rigging that was ami&s;s: and I enquired al&s;o of my particular Officers who&s;e Bu|&s;ine&s;s it was, whether they wanted any Stores, e&s;pecially Pitch and Tar; for that here I wou'd &s;upply my &s;elf before I pro|ceeded any farther: but they &s;ay they had enough, tho' it did not afterwards prove &s;o.</P>
<P>I commonly went a&s;hore every day, either upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, or to recreate my &s;elf in the Fields, which were very plea|&s;ant, and the more for a &s;hower of Rain now and then, that u&s;hers in the Wet Sea|&s;on. Several &s;orts of good Fruits were al|&s;o &s;till remaining, e&s;pecially Oranges, which were in &s;uch plenty, that I and all my Company &s;tock'd our &s;elves for our Voyage with them, and they did us a great kindne&s;s; and we took in al&s;o a good quantity of Rum and Sugar: But for Fowls, they being here lean and dear, I was glad I had &s;tockt my &s;elf at St. <HI>Jago.</HI> But by the little care my Officers took for fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, one might conclude, they did not think of going much farther. Be|&s;ides, I had like to have been imbroiled with the Clergy here (of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;e) and &s;o my Voyage might have been hindred. What was &s;aid to them of me, by &s;ome of my Company that went a&s;hore, I know not; but I was a&s;&s;ur'd by a Merchant there, that if they got me into their Clutches (and
<PB N="90" REF="119">
it &s;eems, when I was la&s;t a&s;hore they had narrowly watch'd me) the Governor him|&s;elf could not relea&s;e me. Be&s;ides I might either be murther'd in the Streets, as he &s;ent me word, or Poy&s;oned, if I came a|&s;hore any more; and therefore he advi&s;ed me to &s;tay aboard. Indeed I had now no further Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;hore but to take leave of the Governor, and therefore took his Ad|vice.</P>
<P>Our Stay here was till the 23d of <HI>April.</HI> I would have gone before if I could &s;ooner have fitted my &s;elf; but was now earne&s;t to be gone, becau&s;e this Harbour lies open to the S. and S. S. W. which are raging Winds here, and now was the Sea&s;on for them. We had had two or three Touches of them; and one pretty &s;evere: and the Ships ride there &s;o near each other, that if a Cable &s;hould fail, or an Anchor &s;tart, you are in&s;tantly aboard of one Ship or other: and I was more afraid of being di&s;|abled here in Harbour by the&s;e blu&s;tring Winds, than di&s;couraged by them, as my People were, from pro&s;ecuting the Voy|age; for at pre&s;ent I even wi&s;h'd for a brisk Southerly Wind as &s;oon as I &s;hould be once well out of the Harbour, to &s;et me the &s;ooner into the True General Trade-Wind.</P>
<P>The Tide of Flood being &s;pent, and having a fine Land-Breez on the 23d. in
<PB N="91" REF="120">
the Morning, I went away from the An|choring-place before 'twas light; and then lay by till Day-light that we might &s;ee the better how to go out of the Harbour. I had a Pilot belonging to Mr. <HI>Cock</HI> who went out with me, to whom I gave three Dollars; but I found I could as well have gone out my Self, by the Soundings I made at coming in. The Wind was E. by N. and fair Weather. By 10 a Clock I was got pa&s;t all danger, and then &s;ent away my Pilot. At 12 Cape <HI>Salvadore</HI> bore N. di|&s;tant 6 Leagues, and we had the Winds between the E. by N. and S. E. a con&s;i|derable time, &s;o that we kept along near the Shore, commonly in &s;ight of it. The Southerly Bla&s;ts had now left us again; for they come at fir&s;t in &s;hort Flurries, and &s;hift to other Points (for 10 or 12 days &s;ometimes) before they are quite &s;et in: And we had uncertain Winds, between Sea and Land-Breezes, and the Coa&s;ting-Trade, which was its &s;elf un&s;etled.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;terly-Winds at pre&s;ent made me doubt I &s;hould not weather a great Shoal which lies in Lat. between 18 deg. and 19 deg. S. and runs a great way into the Sea, directly from the Land, Ea&s;terly. Indeed the Weather was fair (and conti|nued &s;o a good while) &s;o that I might the better avoid any Danger from it: and if the Wind came to the Southward I knew
<PB N="92" REF="121">
I could &s;tretch off to Sea; &s;o that I jogg'd on couragiou&s;ly. The 27th of <HI>April</HI> we &s;aw a &s;mall Brigantine under the Shore plying to the Southward. We al&s;o &s;aw many Men of War-birds and Boobies, and abundance of <HI>Albicore</HI>-Fi&s;h. Having &s;till fair Weather, &s;mall Gales, and &s;ome Calms, I had the opportunity of trying the Current, which I found to &s;et &s;ome|times Northerly and &s;ometimes Southerly: and therefore knew I was &s;till within the Verge of the Tides. Being now in the Lat. of the <HI>Abrohlo</HI> Shoals, which I expected to meet with, I &s;ounded, and had Water le&s;&s;ening from 40 to 33. and &s;o to 25 Fa|thom: but then it ro&s;e again to 33, 35, 37. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all Coral Rocks. Whil&s;t we were on this Shoal (which we cro&s;st towards the further part of it from Land, where it lay deep, and &s;o was not dangerous) we caught a great many Fi&s;h with Hook and Line; and by evening Amplitude we had 6 deg. 38 min. Ea&s;t Variation. This was the 27th of <HI>April;</HI> we were then in Lat. 18 deg. 13 min. S. and Ea&s;t Longitude from Cape <HI>Salvadore</HI> 31 min. On the 29th, being then in Lat. 18 deg. 39 min. S. we had &s;mall Gales from the W. N. W. to the W. S. W. often &s;hifting. The 30th we had the Winds from W. to S. S. E. Squals and Rain: and we &s;aw &s;ome Dol|phins and other Fi&s;h about us. We were
<PB N="93" REF="122">
now out of &s;ight of Land, and had been &s;o 4 or 5 Days: but the Wind's now hang|ing in the South was an apparent Sign that we were &s;till too nigh the Shore to receive the True General Ea&s;t-Trade; as the Ea&s;terly Winds we had before &s;hew'd that we were too far off the Land to have the Benefit of the Coa&s;ting South-Trade: and the faintne&s;s of both the&s;e Winds, and their often &s;hifting from the S. S. W. to the S. E. with Squalls, Rain and &s;mall Gales, were a Confirmation of our being between the Verge of the S. Coa&s;ting-Trade, and that of the True Trade; which is here, regularly, S. E.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>May</HI> being in Lat. 20 deg. 00 min. and Merid. di&s;tance We&s;t from Cape <HI>Salvadore</HI> 234 Miles, the Variation was 7 deg. 00 min. We &s;aw no Fowl but Shear-waters, as our Sea-men call them, being a &s;mall black Fowl that &s;weep the Water as they fly, and are much in the Seas that lie without either of the <HI>Tropicks:</HI> they are not eaten. We caught 3 &s;mall Sharks, each 6 Foot 4 Inches long; and they were very good Food for us. The next day we caught 3 more Sharks of the &s;ame &s;ize, and we eat them al&s;o, e&s;teem|ing them as good Fi&s;h boil'd and pre&s;st, and then &s;tew'd with Vinegar and Pep|per.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="123">
We had nothing of Remark from the 3d of <HI>May</HI> to the 10th, only now and then &s;eeing a &s;mall Whale &s;pouting up the Water. We had the Wind Ea&s;terly, and we ran with it to the Southward, running in this time from the Lat. of 20 deg. 00 m. to 29 deg. 5 min. S. and having, then, 7 d. 3 m. E. Long. from C. <HI>Salvadore;</HI> the Va|riation increa&s;ing upon us, at pre&s;ent, notwith&s;tanding we went Ea&s;t. We had all along a great difference between the Morning and Evening Amplitudes; u&s;ual|ly a degree or two, and &s;ometimes more. We were now in the True Trade, and therefore made good way to the South|ward, to get without the Verge of the General Trade Wind into a We&s;terly Wind's way, that might carry us towards the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> By the 12th of <HI>May,</HI> being in Lat. 31 deg. 10 min. we began to meet with We&s;terly Winds, which fre&s;hned on us, and did not leave us till a little before we made the Cape. Some|times it blew &s;o hard that it put us under a fore-cour&s;e; e&s;pecially in the Night: but in the day-time we had commonly our Main Top-&s;ail ri&s;t. We met with nothing of moment; only we pa&s;t by a dead Whale, and &s;aw millions (as I may &s;ay) of Sea-Fowls about the Carka&s;s (and as far round about it as we could &s;ee) &s;ome Feeding, and the re&s;t flying about, or &s;it|ting
<PB N="95" REF="124">
on the Water, waiting to take their Turns. We fir&s;t di&s;covered the Whale by the Fowls; for indeed I did never &s;ee &s;o many Fowls at once in my Life before, their Numbers being inconceivably great: They were of divers &s;orts, in Bigne&s;s, Shape and Colour. Some were almo&s;t as big as Gee&s;e, of a grey Colour, with White Brea&s;ts, and with &s;uch Bills, Wings, and Tails. Some were <HI>Pintado</HI> Birds, as big as Ducks, and &s;peckled Black and White. Some were Shear-waters; &s;ome Petrels; and there were &s;everal &s;orts of large Fowls. We &s;aw of the&s;e Birds, e&s;|pecially the <HI>Pintado</HI>-birds, all the Sea over from about 200 Leagues di&s;tant from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> to within much the &s;ame di&s;tance of <HI>New Holland.</HI> The <HI>Pintado</HI> is a Southern Bird, and of that Temperate Zone; for I never &s;aw of them much to the Norward of 30 deg. S. The <HI>Pintado</HI>-bird is as big as a Duck; but appears, as it flies, about the bigne&s;s of a tame Pigeon, having a &s;hort Tail, but the Wings very long, as mo&s;t Sea-Fowls have; e&s;pecially &s;uch as the&s;e that fly far from the Shore, and &s;eldom come nigh it: for their Re&s;t|ing is &s;itting afloat upon the Water; but they lay, I &s;uppo&s;e, a&s;hore. There are three &s;orts of the&s;e Birds, all of the &s;ame make and bigne&s;s, and are only different in Colour. The fir&s;t is black all over:
<PB N="96" REF="125">
The &s;econd &s;ort are grey, with white Bellies and Brea&s;ts. The third &s;ort, which is the true <HI>Pintado,</HI> or Painted-bird, is cu|riou&s;ly &s;potted white and black. Their Heads, and the tips of their Wings and Tails, are black for about an Inch; and their Wings are al&s;o edg'd quite round with &s;uch a &s;mall black Li&s;t: only within the black on the tip of their Wings there is a white Spot &s;eeming as they fly (for then their Spots are be&s;t &s;een) as big as a Half-crown. All this is on the out&s;ide of the Tails and Wings; and as there is a white Spot in the black Tip of the Wings, &s;o there is in the middle of the Wings which is white, a black Spot; but this, towards the Back of the Bird, turns gradu|ally to a dark grey. The Back its &s;elf, from the Head to the Tip of the Tail, and the Edge of the Wings next to the Back, are all over-&s;potted with fine &s;mall, round, white and black Spots, as big as a Silver Two-pence, and as clo&s;e as they can &s;tick one by another: The Belly, Thighs, Sides, and inner part of the Wings are of a light Grey. The&s;e Birds, of all the&s;e &s;orts, fly many together, never high, but almo&s;t &s;weeping the Water. We &s;hot one a while after on the Water in a Calm, and a Wa|ter-Spaniel we had with us brought it in: I have given a Picture of it [See <HI>Birds.</HI> Fig. 1.] but it was &s;o damaged, that the Picture

<P>The Petrel is a Bird not much unlike a Swallow, but &s;maller, and with a &s;horter Tail. 'Tis all over black, except a white Spot on the Rump. They fly &s;weeping like Swallows, and very near the Water. They are not &s;o often &s;een in fair Weather; being Foul-weather Birds, as our Seamen call them, and pre&s;aging a Storm when they come about a Ship; who for that Rea&s;on don't love to &s;ee them. In a Storm they will hover clo&s;e under the Ship's Stern, in the Wake of the Ship (as 'tis call'd) or the &s;moothne&s;s which the Ship's pa&s;&s;ing has made on the Sea: and there as they fly (gently then) they pat the Water alter|nately with their Feet, as if they walkt upon it; tho' &s;till upon the Wing. And from hence the Seamen give them the name of <HI>Petrels,</HI> in allu&s;ion to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s walking upon the Lake of <HI>Genne&s;areth.</HI></P>
<P>We al&s;o &s;aw many Bunches of Sea|weeds in the Lat. of 39. 32. and by Judg|ment, near the Meridian of the I&s;land <HI>Tri|&s;tian d'Aconha:</HI> and then we had about 2 d. 20 min.

My Reck|oning made me then think my &s;elf above 90 Leagues from the <HI>Cape,</HI> according to the Longitude which the <HI>Cape</HI> hath in the com|mon Sea-Charts: &s;o that I was in &s;ome doubt, whether the&s;e were the right Fowls &s;poken of in the Waggoner; or whether tho&s;e Fowls might not fly farther off Shore than is there mentioned; or whe|ther, as it prov'd, I might not be nearer the <HI>Cape</HI> than I reckoned my &s;elf to be: for I found, &s;oon after, that I was not then above 25 or 30 Leagues at mo&s;t from the Cape.

<P>Mo&s;t of my Men that kept Journals im|puted it to the Half-Minute-gla&s;&s;es; and indeed we had not a good Gla&s;s in the Ship be&s;ide the Half-watch or Two Hour-Gla&s;|&s;es. As for our Half-Minute-Gla&s;&s;es we tried them all at &s;everal times, and we found tho&s;e that we had us'd from <HI>Brazil</HI> as much too &s;hort, as others we had us'd before were too long: which might well make great Errors in tho&s;e &s;everal Reck|onings. A Ship ought therefore to have its Gla&s;&s;es very exact: and be&s;ides, an ex|traordinary Care ought to be u&s;ed in heav|ing the Log, for fear of giving too much Stray-Line in a moderate Gale; and al&s;o to &s;top quickly in a brisk Gale; for when a Ship runs 8, 9, or 10 Knots, half a Knot or a Knot is &s;oon run out, and not heeded: But to prevent danger, when a Man thinks him&s;elf near Land, the be&s;t way is to look out betimes, and lie by in the Night: for a Commander may err ea&s;ily him&s;elf; be|&s;ide the Errors of tho&s;e under him, tho' never &s;o carefully eyed.</P>
<P>Another thing that &s;tumbled me here was the <HI>Variation,</HI> which, at this time, by the la&s;t Amplitude I had I found to be but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> deg. 58 min. W. whereas the Variation
<PB N="100" REF="130">
at the <HI>Cape</HI> (from which I found my &s;elf not 30 Leagues di&s;tant) was then com|puted, and truly, about 11 Deg. or more: And yet a while after this, when I was got 10 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of the <HI>Cape,</HI> I found the Variation but 10 Deg. 40 Min. W. whereas it &s;hould have been rather more than at the <HI>Cape.</HI> The&s;e Things, I con|fe&s;s, did puzzle me: neither was I fully &s;atisfied as to the Exactne&s;s of the taking the Variation at Sea: For in a great Sea, which we often meet with, the Compa&s;s will traver&s;e with the motion of the Ship; be&s;ides the Ship may and will deviate &s;ome|what in Steering, even by the be&s;t Helm&s;|men: And then when you come to take an <HI>Azimuth,</HI> there is often &s;ome difference be|tween him that looks at the Compa&s;s, and the Man that takes the Altitude heighth of the Sun; and a &s;mall Error in each, if the Error of both &s;hould be one way, will make it wide of any great Exactne&s;s. But what was mo&s;t &s;hocking to me, I found that the Variation did not always increa&s;e or decrea&s;e in proportion to the Degrees of Longitude Ea&s;t or We&s;t; as I had a No|tion they might do to a certain Number of Degrees of Variation Ea&s;t or We&s;t, at &s;uch or &s;uch particular Meridians. But finding in this Voyage that the Difference of Variation did not bear a regular pro|portion to the difference of Longitude, I
<PB N="101" REF="131">
was much pleas'd to &s;ee it thus Ob&s;erv'd in a Scheme &s;hewn me after my Return home, wherein are repre&s;ented the &s;everal Vari|ations in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, on both &s;ides the Equator; and there, the Line of no Variation in that Sea is not a Meridian Line, but goes very oblique, as do tho&s;e al&s;o which &s;hew the Increa&s;e of Variation on each &s;ide of it. In that Draught there is &s;o large an Advance made as well to|wards the Accounting for tho&s;e &s;eemingly Irregular Increa&s;es and Decrea&s;es of Vari|ation towards the S. E. Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> as towards the fixing a general Scheme or Sy&s;tem of the Variation every where, which would be of &s;uch great U&s;e in Na|vigation, that I cannot but hope that the Ingenious Author, Capt. <HI>Halley,</HI> who to his profound Skill in all Theories of the&s;e kinds, hath added and is adding continu|ally Per&s;onal Experiments, will e'er long oblige the World with a fuller Di&s;covery of the Cour&s;e of the Variation, which hath hitherto been a Secret. For my part I pro|fe&s;s my &s;elf unqualified for offering at any thing of a General Scheme; but &s;ince Matter of Fact, and whatever increa&s;es the Hi&s;tory of the Variation, may be of u&s;e towards the &s;etling or confirming the Theory of it, I &s;hall here once for all in|&s;ert a <HI>Table</HI> of all the <HI>Variations</HI> I ob&s;erv'd beyond the <HI>Equator</HI> in this Voyage, both

But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion: Having fair Weather, and the Winds hang|ing Southerly, I jog'd on to the Ea&s;tward, to make the <HI>Cape.</HI> On the third of <HI>June</HI> we &s;aw a Sail to Leeward of us, &s;hewing <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours. I bore away to &s;peak with her, and found her to be the <HI>Antelope</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Ham|mond,</HI> and bound for the Bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> in the Service of the <HI>New-Ea&s;t-India</HI> Compa|ny. There were many Pa&s;&s;engers aboard, going to &s;ettle there under Sir <HI>Edward Lit|tleton,</HI> who was going Chief thither: I went aboard, and was known by Sir <HI>Ed|ward,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hedges,</HI> and kindly received and treated by them and the Commander; who had been afraid of us before, tho' I had &s;ent one of my Officers aboard. They had been in at the <HI>Cape,</HI> and came from thence the Day before, having &s;tockt them|&s;elves with Refre&s;hments. They told me that they were by Reckoning, 60 Miles to the We&s;t of the <HI>Cape.</HI> While I was aboard them, a fine &s;mall We&s;terly Wind &s;prang up; therefore I &s;hortned my &s;tay with them, becau&s;e I did not de&s;ign to go in to the <HI>Cape.</HI> When I took leave I was pre&s;ented with half a Mutton, 12 Cabbages, 12 Pum|kins, 6 Pound of Butter, 6 Couple of Stockfi&s;h, and a quantity of Par&s;nips; &s;ending them &s;ome Oatmeal, which they wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="139">
From my fir&s;t &s;etting out from <HI>England,</HI> I did not de&s;ign to touch at the <HI>Cape;</HI> and that was one Rea&s;on why I touch'd at <HI>Bra|zil,</HI> that there I might refre&s;h my Men, and prepare them for a long Run to <HI>New Holland.</HI> We had not yet &s;een the Land; but about 2 in the Afternoon we &s;aw the <HI>Cape</HI>-Land bearing Ea&s;t, at above 16 Leagues di&s;tance: And Captain <HI>Hammond</HI> being al&s;o bound to double the <HI>Cape,</HI> we jog'd on together this Afternoon and the next Day, and had &s;everal fair Sights of it; which may be &s;een [<HI>Table</HI> III.

<P>To proceed, having &s;till a We&s;terly Wind, I jog'd on in company with the <HI>Antelope,</HI> till Sunday <HI>June</HI> the 4th at 4 in the Afternoon, when we parted; they &s;teering away for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and I keeping an E.

The Wind increa&s;ed upon us; but

we had yet &s;ight of the <HI>Antelope,</HI> and of the Land too, till <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 6th of <HI>June:</HI> And then we &s;aw al&s;o by us an inumerable Company of Fowls of divers &s;orts; &s;o that we lookt about to &s;ee if there were not another dead Whale, but &s;aw none.</P>
<P>The Night before, the Sun &s;et in a black Cloud, which appeared ju&s;t like Land; and the Clouds above it were gilded of a dark red Colour. And on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> as the Sun drew near the Horizon, the Clouds were gilded very prettily to the Eye, tho' at the &s;ame time my Mind dreaded the Con&s;e|quences of it. When the Sun was now not above 2 deg. high, it entered into a dark &s;moaky-coloured Cloud that lay parallel with the Horizon, from whence pre&s;ently &s;eem'd to i&s;&s;ue many dusky blacki&s;h Beams. The Sky was at this time covered with &s;mall hard Clouds (as we call &s;uch as lie &s;cattering about, not likely to Rain) very thick one by another; and &s;uch of them as lay next to the Bank of Clouds at the Horizon, were of a pure Gold colour to 3 or 4 deg. high above the Bank: From the&s;e to about 10 deg. high they were redder, and very bright; above them they were of a darker Colour &s;till, to about 60 or 70 deg. high; where the Clouds began to be of their common Colour. I took the more particu|lar Notice of all this, becau&s;e I have gene|rally ob&s;erved &s;uch colour'd Clouds to ap|pear

before an approaching Storm: And this being Winter here, and the time for bad Weather, I expected and provided for a violent Bla&s;t of Wind, by riffing our Top|&s;ails, and giving a &s;trict charge to my Of|ficers to hand them or take them in, if the Wind &s;hould grow &s;tronger. The Wind was now at W. N. W. a very brisk Gale. About 12 a Clock at Night we had a pale whiti&s;h Glare in the N. W. which was another Sign, and intimated the Storm to be near at hand; and the Wind increa&s;ing upon it, we pre&s;ently handed our Top&s;ails, furled the Main&s;ail, and went away only with our Fore&s;ail. Before 2 in the Morn|ing it came on very fierce, and we kept right before Wind and Sea, the Wind &s;till increa&s;ing: But the Ship was very govern|able, and Steer'd incomparably well. At 8 in the Morning we &s;ettled our Fore-Yard, lowering it 4 or 5 Foot, and we ran very &s;wiftly; e&s;pecially when the Squals of Rain or Hail, from a black Cloud, came over head, for then it blew exce&s;&s;ive hard. The&s;e, tho' they did not la&s;t long, yet came very thick and fa&s;t one after another. The Sea al&s;o ran very high: But we running &s;o violently before Wind and Sea, we Shipt little or no Water; tho' a little wa&s;ht into our upper Deck-Ports; and with it a Scuttle or Cuttle-Fi&s;h was ca&s;t upon the Carriage of a Gun.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="142">
The Wind blew extraordinary hard all <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 7th of <HI>June,</HI> but abated of its fiercene&s;s before Night: Yet it continu|ed a brisk Gale till about the 16th, and &s;till a moderate one till the 19th Day; by which time we had run about 600 Leagues: For the mo&s;t part of which time the Wind was in &s;ome point of the We&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> from the W. N. W. to the S. by W. It blew hard|e&s;t when at W. or between the W. and S. W. but after it veered more Southerly the foul Weather broke up: This I ob&s;erved at other times al&s;o in the&s;e Seas, that when the Storms at We&s;t veered to the South|ward they grew le&s;s; and that when the Wind came to the E. of the S. we had &s;till &s;maller Gales, Calms, and fair Wea|ther. As for the We&s;terly Winds on that &s;ide the <HI>Cape,</HI> we like them never the wor&s;e for being violent, for they drive us the fa&s;ter to the Ea&s;tward; and are therefore the only Winds coveted by tho&s;e who &s;ail towards &s;uch parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> as lie South of the Equator; as <HI>Timor, Java,</HI> and <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and by the Ships bound for <HI>China,</HI> or any other that are to pa&s;s through the Streights of <HI>Sundy.</HI> Tho&s;e Ships having once pa&s;t the <HI>Cape,</HI> keep commonly pretty far Southerly, on purpo&s;e to meet with the&s;e We&s;t Winds, which in the Winter Sea&s;on of the&s;e Climates they &s;oon meet with; for then the Winds are generally We&s;terly at

the <HI>Cape,</HI> and e&s;pecially to the Southward of it: But in their Summer Months they get to the Southward of 40 deg. u&s;ually e'er they meet with the We&s;terly Winds. I was not at this time in a higher Lat. than 36 deg. 40 min. and oftentimes was more Northerly, altering my Latitude often as Winds and Weather requir'd; for in &s;uch long Runs 'tis be&s;t to &s;hape ones Cour&s;e ac|cording to the Winds. And if in Steering to the Ea&s;t, we &s;hould be obliged to bear a little to the N. or S. of it, 'tis no great matter; for 'tis but Sailing 2 or 3 Points from the Wind, when 'tis either Norther|ly or Southerly; and this not only ea&s;eth the Ship from &s;training, but &s;hortens the way more than if a Ship was kept clo&s;e on a Wind, as &s;ome Men are fond of doing.</P>
<P>The 19th of <HI>June</HI> we were in Lat. 34 deg. 17 min. S. and Long. from the <HI>Cape</HI> 39 deg. 24 min. E. and had &s;mall Gales and Calms. The Winds were at N. E. by E. and continued in &s;ome part of the E. till the 27th Day. When it having been &s;ome time at N. N. E. it came about at N. and then to the W. of the N. and continu|ed in the We&s;t-board (between the N. N. W. and S. S. W.) till the 4th of <HI>July;</HI> in which time we ran 782 Miles; then the Winds came about again to the Ea&s;t, we reckoning our &s;elves to be in a Meridian 1100 L.

We met with little of Remark in this Voyage, be&s;ides being accompanied with Fowles all the way, e&s;pecially Pintado-Birds, and &s;eeing now and then a Whale: But as we drew nigher the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-Holland,</HI> we &s;aw frequently 3 or 4 Whales together. When we were about 90 Leagues from the Land we began to &s;ee Sea-weeds, all of one &s;ort; and as we drew nigher the Shore we &s;aw them more fre|quently. At about 30 Leagues di&s;tance we began to &s;ee &s;ome Scutle-bones floating on the Water; and drawing &s;till nigher the Land we &s;aw greater quantities of them.</P>

The next Day the Sea was full of &s;mall round things like Pearl, &s;ome as big as white Peas; they were very Clear and Tran&s;parent, and upon cru&s;hing any of them a drop of Water would come forth: The Skin that contained the Water was &s;o thin that it was but ju&s;t de&s;eernable. Some Weeds &s;wam by us, &s;o that we did not doubt but we &s;hould quickly &s;ee Land.

On the 27th al&s;o, &s;ome Weeds &s;wam by us, and the Birds that had flown along with us all the way almo&s;t from <HI>Brazil,</HI> now left us, except only 2 or 3 Shear-waters. On the 28th we &s;aw many Weeds &s;wim by us, and &s;ome Whales, blowing. On the 29th we had dark cloudy Weather, with much Thunder, Lightning, and vio|lent Rains in the Morning: But in the E|vening it grew fair. We &s;aw this Day a Scutle-bone &s;wim by us, and &s;ome of our young Men a Seal, as it &s;hould &s;eem by their De&s;cription of its Head. I &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome Boneta's, and &s;ome Skipjacks, a Fi&s;h about 8 Inches long, broad and &s;izable, not much unlike a Roach; which our Sea|men call &s;o from their leaping about.</P>
<P>The 30th of <HI>July,</HI> being &s;till nearer the Land, we &s;aw abundance of Scutle-bones and Sea-weed, more Tokens that we were not far from it; and &s;aw al&s;o a &s;ort of Fowls the like of which we had not &s;een in the whole Voyage, all the other Fowls ha|ving now left us. The&s;e were as big as Lapwings; of a grey Colour, black about their Eyes, with red &s;harp Bills, long Wings, their Tails long and forked like Swallows; and they flew flapping their Wings like Lapwings. In the Afternoon we met with a Ripling like a Tide or Cur|rent, or the Water of &s;ome Shole or Over|fal; but were pa&s;t it before we could &s;ound.

5 we had 45 Fathom, cour&s;e Sand and Shells; being now off the Shole, as ap|pear'd by the Sand and Shells, and by hav|ing left the Coral. By all this I knew we had fall'n in to the North of the Shole, and that it was laid down wrong in my Sea-Chart: for I found it lie in about 27 deg. Lat. and by our Run in the next day, I found that the Outward-edge of it, which I &s;ounded on, lies 16 Leagues off Shore. When it was day we &s;teered in E. N. E. with a fine brisk Gale; but did not &s;ee the Land till 9 in the Morning, when we &s;aw it from our Topma&s;t-head, and were di&s;tant from it about 10 Leagues; having then 40 Fathom-water, and clean Sand. About 3 Hours after we &s;aw it on our Quarter-Deck, being by Judgment about 6 Leagues off: and we had then 40 Fa|thom, clean Sand.

and a &s;ort of white Sea-Mews, but black about the Eyes, and with forked Tails. We &s;trove to run in near the Shore to &s;eek for a Harbour to refre&s;h us after our tedious Voyage; having made one continued &s;tretch from <HI>Brazil</HI> hither of a|bout 114 Deg.; de&s;igning from hence al|&s;o to begin the Di&s;covery I had a mind to make on <HI>N.

N^o. 3, 4, 5.) with &s;ome red and &s;ome white Clifts; the&s;e la&s;t in Lat. 26. 10 S. where you will find 54 Fathom, within four Miles of the Shore.</P>
<P>About the Lat. of 26 deg.

The Land every where appear'd pretty low, flat and even; but with &s;teep Cliffs to the Sea; and when we came near it there were no Trees, Shrubs or Gra&s;s to be &s;een. The Sound|ings in the Lat. of 26 deg. S. from about 8 or 9 Leagues off till you come within a League of the Shore, are generally about 40 Fathom; differing but little, &s;eldom above three or four Fathom. But the

Lead brings up very different &s;orts of Sand, &s;ome cour&s;e, &s;ome fine; and of &s;e|veral Colours, as Yellow, White, Grey, Brown, Blui&s;h and Reddi&s;h.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw there was no Harbour here, nor good Anchoring, I &s;tood off to Sea a|gain, in the Evening of the &s;econd of <HI>Au|gust,</HI> fearing a Storm on a Lee-&s;hore, in a place where there was no &s;helter, and de|&s;iring at lea&s;t to have Sea-Room: For the Clouds began to grow thick in the We&s;t|ern-board, and the Wind was already there, and began to blow fre&s;h almo&s;t upon the Shore; which at this Place lies along N. N. W. and S. S. E. By Nine a Clock at Night we had got a pretty good Offin; but the Wind &s;till increa&s;ing, I took in my Main Top-&s;ail, being able to carry no more Sail than two Cour&s;es and the Mizen. At two in the Morning, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3. it blew very hard, and the Sea was much rai&s;ed; &s;o that I furled all my Sails but my Main-&s;ail. Tho' the Wind blew &s;o hard, we had yet pretty clear Weather till Noon: But then the whole Sky was blackned with thick Clouds, and we had &s;ome Rain, which would la&s;t a quarter of an hour at a time, and then it would blow very fierce while the Squals of Rain were over our Heads; but as &s;oon as they were gone the Wind was by much abated, the &s;tre&s;s of the Storm being over.

Lat. and our Reckoning made its Longitude from the C. of <HI>Good Hope</HI> to be about 87 Degrees; which is le&s;s by 195 Leagues than is u&s;ually laid down in our common Draughts, if our Reckoning was right, and our Gla&s;&s;es did not deceive

us. As &s;oon as I came to anchor in this Bay (of which I have given a Plan, Table IV. N^o. 6.) I &s;ent my Boat a&s;hore to &s;eek for fre&s;h Water: But in the Evening my Men returned, having found none. The next morning I went a&s;hore my &s;elf, carrying Pick-axes and Shovels with me, to dig for Water; and Axes to cut Wood. We tried in &s;everal places for Water, but finding none after &s;everal Trials, nor in &s;everal miles compa&s;s, we left any farther &s;earch for it, and &s;pending the re&s;t of the day in cutting Wood, we went aboard at Night.</P>
<P>The Land is of an indifferent heighth, &s;o that it may be &s;een 9 or 10 Leagues off. It appears at a di&s;tance very even; but as you come nigher you find there are many gentle Ri&s;ings, tho' none &s;teep nor high. 'Tis all a &s;teep Shore again&s;t the open Sea: but in this Bay or Sound we were now in, the Land is low by the Sea-&s;ide, ri|&s;ing gradually in within the Land. The Mould is Sand by the Sea-&s;ide, producing a large &s;ort of Sampier, which bears a white Flower. Farther in, the Mould is reddi&s;h, a &s;ort of Sand producing &s;ome Gra&s;s, Plants, and Shrubs. The Gra&s;s grows in great Tufts, as big as a Bu&s;hel, here and there a Tuft: being intermix'd with much Heath, much of the kind we have growing on our Commons in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="153">
Of Trees or Shrubs here are divers &s;orts; but none above ten Foot high: Their Bodies about 3 Foot about, and 5 or 6 Foot high before you come to the Branches, which are bu&s;hy and compos'd of &s;mall Twigs there &s;preading abroad, tho' thick &s;et, and full of Leaves; which were mo&s;tly long and narrow. The Co|lour of the Leaves was on one &s;ide Whi|ti&s;h, and on the other Green: and the Bark of the Trees was generally of the &s;ame Colour with the Leaves, of a pale Green. Some of the&s;e Trees were &s;weet|&s;cented, and reddi&s;h within the Bark, like Sa&s;&s;afras, but redder. Mo&s;t of the Trees and Shrubs had at this time either Blo&s;|&s;oms or Berries on them. The Blo&s;&s;oms of the different &s;ort of Trees were of &s;everal Colours, as Red, White, Yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but mo&s;tly Blue: and the&s;e generally &s;melt very &s;weet and fragrant, as did &s;ome al&s;o of the re&s;t. There were al&s;o be&s;ide &s;ome Plants, Herbs, and tall Flowers, &s;ome ve|ry &s;mall Flowers, growing on the Ground, that were &s;weet and beautiful, and for the mo&s;t part unlike any I had &s;een el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>There were but few Land-Fowls: we &s;aw none but Eagles, of the larger &s;orts of Birds; but 5 or 6 &s;orts of &s;mall Birds. The bigge&s;t &s;ort of the&s;e were not bigger than Larks; &s;ome no bigger than Wrens, all

<P>The Land-Animals that we &s;aw here were only a &s;ort of Raccoons, different from tho&s;e of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> chiefly as to their Legs; for the&s;e have very &s;hort fore Legs; but go Jumping upon them as the others do, and like them are very good Meat:) and a &s;ort of Guano's, of the &s;ame &s;hape and &s;ize with other Guano's, de&s;crib'd [Vol. I. p. 57.] but differing from them in three remarkable Particu|lars: For the&s;e had a larger and uglier Head; and had no Tail: And at the Rump, in&s;tead of the Tail there, they had a &s;tump of a Tail, which appear'd like another Head; but not really &s;uch, being without Mouth or Eyes: Yet this Crea|ture &s;eem'd by this means to have a Head at each end; and, which may be reckon'd a fourth difference, the Legs al&s;o &s;eem'd all four of them to be Fore-legs, being all a|like in &s;hape and length, and &s;eeming by

the Joints and Bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently either Head or Tail foremo&s;t. They were &s;peckled black and yellow like Toads, and had Scales or Knobs on their Backs like tho&s;e of Crocodiles, plated on to the Skin, or &s;tuck into it, as part of the Skin. They are ve|ry &s;low. in motion; and when a Man comes nigh them they will &s;tand &s;till and hi&s;s, not endeavouring to get away. Their Livers are al&s;o &s;potted black and yellow: and the Body when opened hath a very un&s;avory Smell. I did never &s;ee &s;uch ugly Creatures any where but here. The Guano's I have ob&s;erv'd to be very good Meat: and I have often eaten of them with plea&s;ure: But tho' I have eaten of Snakes, Crocodiles and Allegators, and many Creatures that look frightfully e|nough, and there are but few I &s;hould have been afraid to eat of if pre&s;t by Hun|ger, yet I think my Stomach would &s;carce have &s;erv'd to venture upon the&s;e <HI>N.

<P>The Sea-fi&s;h that we &s;aw here (for here was no River, Land or Pond of Fre&s;h Wa|ter to be &s;een) are chiefly Sharks.

<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome green Turtle weigh|ing about 200 lb. Of the&s;e we caught 2 which the Water Ebbing had left behind a Ledge of Rock, which they could not creep over.

Among them we caught one which was 11 Foot long. The &s;pace between its 2 Eyes was 20 Inches, and 18 Inches from one Corner of his Mouth to the other. Its Maw was like a Leather Sack, very thick, and &s;o tough that a &s;harp Knife could &s;carce cut it: In which we found the Head and Boans of a <HI>Hippopotomus;</HI> the hairy Lips of which were &s;till &s;ound and not putrified,

<P>'Twas the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> when we came into <HI>Shark</HI>'s-Bay; in which we Anchor'd at three &s;everal Places, and &s;tay'd at the fir&s;t of them (on the W. &s;ide of the Bay) till the 11th. During which time we &s;earch|ed about, as I &s;aid, for fre&s;h Water, digging Wells, but to no purpo&s;e.

Yet &s;till I was for &s;tanding farther into the Bay, partly becau&s;e I had a Mind to increa&s;e my &s;tock of fre&s;h Water, which was began to be low; and partly for the &s;ake of Di&s;covering this part of the Coa&s;t.

I &s;teer'd farther in, with an ea&s;ie Sail, be|cau&s;e we had but &s;hallow Water: We kept therefore good looking out for fear of Sholes; &s;ometimes &s;hortning, &s;ometimes deepning the Water. About 2 in the Afternoon we &s;aw the Land a Head that makes the S. of the Bay, and before Night we had again Sholdings from that Shore: And therefore &s;hortned Sail and &s;tood off and on all Night, under 2 Top&s;ails, conti|nually &s;ounding, having never more then 10 Fathom, and &s;eldom le&s;s than 7. The Water deepned and &s;holdned &s;o very gent|ly, that in heaving the Lead 5 or 6 times we &s;hould &s;carce have a Foot difference. When we came into 7 Fathom either way, we pre&s;ently went about. From this S. part of the Bay, we could not &s;ee the Land from whence we came in the Afternoon: And this Land we found to be an I&s;land of 3 or 4 Leagues long, as is &s;een in the Plain, [Ta|ble IV. No. 6.] but it appearing barren, I did not &s;trive to go nearer it; and the ra|ther becau&s;e the Winds would not permit us to do it without much Trouble, and at the Openings the Water was generally Shole. I therefore made no farther attempts in this S. W. and S. part of the Bay, but &s;teered away to the Ea&s;tward, to &s;ee if there was any Land that way, for as yet we had &s;een none there. On the 12th in the Morning we pa&s;s'd by the N. Point of
<PB N="128" REF="160">
that Land, and were confirm'd in the Per|&s;ua&s;ion of its being an I&s;land, by &s;eeing an Opening to the Ea&s;t of it, as we had done on the W. Having fair Weather, a &s;mall Gale and &s;mooth Water, we &s;tood further on in the Bay, to &s;ee what Land was on the E. of it. Our Soundings at fir&s;t were 7 Fathom, which held &s;o a great while, but at length it decreas'd to 6. Then we &s;aw the Land right a-head, that in the Plan makes the E. of the Bay. We could not come near it with the Ship, hav|ing but Shole water: and it being dange|rous lying there, and the Land extraordi|narily low, very unlikely to have fre&s;h Water (though it had a few Trees on it, &s;eemingly Mangroves) and much of it pro|bably covered at High-water, I &s;tood out again that Afternoon, deepning the Water, and before Night anchored in 8 Fathom, clean white Sand, about the middle of the Bay. The next day we got up our An|chor; and that Afternoon came to an An|chor once more near two I&s;lands, and a Shole of Corral Rocks that face the Bay. Here I &s;crubb'd my Ship: and finding it very improbable I &s;hould get any thing further here, I made the be&s;t of my way out to Sea again, &s;ounding all the way: but finding by the &s;hallowne&s;s of the Wa|ter that there was no going out to Sea to the Ea&s;t of the two I&s;lands that face the
<PB N="129" REF="161">
Bay, nor between them, I return'd to the We&s;t Entrance, going out by the &s;ame Way I came in at, only on the Ea&s;t in&s;tead of the We&s;t-&s;ide of the &s;mall Shole to be &s;een in the Plan: in which Channel we had 10, 12, and 13 Fathom-water, &s;till deep|ning upon us till we were out at Sea. The day before we came out I &s;ent a Boat a|&s;hore to the mo&s;t Northerly of the Two I&s;lands, which is the lea&s;t of them, catch|ing many &s;mall Fi&s;h in the mean while with Hook and Line. The Boat's Crew returning, told me, That the Ifle produces nothing but a &s;ort of green, &s;hort, hard, prickly Gra&s;s, affording neither Wood nor fre&s;h Water; and that a Sea broak between the two I&s;lands, a Sign that the Water was &s;hallow. They &s;aw a large Turtle, and many Skates and Thornbacks, but caught none.</P>
<P>It was <HI>August</HI> the 14th when I &s;ail'd out of this Bay or Sound, the Mouth of which lies, as I &s;aid, in 25 deg. 5 min. de&s;igning to coa&s;t along to the N. E. till I might commodiou&s;ly put in at &s;ome other part of <HI>N. Holland.</HI> In pa&s;&s;ing out we &s;aw three Water-Serpents &s;wimming about in the Sea, of a yellow Colour, &s;potted with dark, brown Spots. They were each a|bout four Foot long, and about the big|ne&s;s of a Man's Wri&s;t, and were the fir&s;t I &s;aw on this Coa&s;t, which abounds with
<PB N="130" REF="162">
&s;everal &s;orts of them. We had the Winds at our fir&s;t coming out at N. and the Land lying North-Ea&s;terly. We plied off and on, getting forward but little till the next day: When the Wind coming at S. S. W. and S. we began to Coa&s;t it along the Shore to the Northward, keeping at 6 or 7 Leagues off Shore; and &s;ounding often, we had between 40 and 46 Fathom-water, brown Sand, with &s;ome white Shells. This 15th of <HI>August</HI> we were in Lat. 24 deg. 41 min. On the 16th Day at Noon we were in 23 deg. 22 min. The Wind com|ing at E. by N. we could not keep the Shore aboard, but were forced to go far|ther off, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the Land. Then &s;ounding we had no Ground with 80 Fa|thom-line; however the Wind &s;hortly af|ter came about again to the Southward, and then we jogg'd on again to the North|ward, and &s;aw many &s;mall Dolphins and Whales, and abundance of Scuttle-&s;hells &s;wimming on the Sea; and &s;ome Water|&s;nakes every day. The 17th we &s;aw the Land again, and took a Sight of it. [See Table IV. N^o. 7.]</P>
<P>The 18th in the Afternoon, being 3 or 4 Leagues off Shore, I &s;aw a Shole point, &s;tretching from the Land into the Sea, a League or more. The Sea broke high on it; by which I &s;aw plainly there was a Shole there. I &s;tood farther off, and coa&s;t|ed
<PB N="131" REF="163">
along Shore, to about 7 or 8 Leagues di&s;tance: And at 12 a Clock at Night we &s;ounded, and had but 20 Fathom, hard Sand. By this I found I was upon ano|ther Shole, and &s;o pre&s;ently &s;teered off W. half an hour, and had then 40 Fathom. At One in the Morning of the 18th day we had 85 Fathom: By Two we could find no Ground; and then I ventur'd to &s;teer along Shore again, due N. which is two Points wide of the Coa&s;t (that lies here N. N. E.) for fear of another Shole. I would not be too far off from the Land, being de&s;irous to &s;earch into it where-ever I &s;hould find an Opening or any Conveni|ence of &s;earching about, for Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When we were off the Shole-point I men|tion'd where we had but 20 Fathom-wa|ter, we had in the Night abundance of Whales about the Ship, &s;ome a head, o|thers a &s;tern, and &s;ome on each &s;ide blow|ing and making a very di&s;mal Noi&s;e; but when we came out again into deeper Wa|ter they left us. Indeed the Noi&s;e that they made by blowing and da&s;hing of the Sea with their Tails, making it all of a Breach and Fome, was very dreadful to us, like the breach of the Waves in very Shole-water, or among Rocks. The Shole the&s;e Whales were upon had depth of Water &s;ufficient, no le&s;s than twenty Fathom, as I &s;aid; and it lies in Lat. 22
<PB N="132" REF="164">
deg. 22 min. The Shore was generally bold all along: we had met with no Shole at Sea &s;ince the <HI>Abrohlo</HI>-&s;hole, when we fir&s;t fell on the <HI>N. Holland</HI> Coa&s;t in the Lat. of 28. till ye&s;terday in the Afternoon, and this Night. This Morning al&s;o when we expected by the Draught we had with us to have been 11 Leagues off Shore, we were but 4: &s;o that either our Draughts were faulty, which yet hitherto and after|wards we found true enough as to the ly|ing of the Coa&s;t, or el&s;e here was a Tide unknown to us that deceived us; tho' we had found very little of any Tide on this Coa&s;t hitherto. As to our Winds in the Coa&s;ting thus far, we had been within the Verge of the General Trade (tho' inter|rupted by the Storm I mention'd) from the Lat. of 28, when we fir&s;t fell in with the Coa&s;t: and by that time we were in the Lat. of 25. we had u&s;ually the regular Trade-wind (which is here S. S. E.) when we were at any di&s;tance &s;rom Shore: but we had often Sea and Land-Breezes, e&s;pe|cially when near Shore, and when in <HI>Sharks bay;</HI> and had a particular N. We&s;t Wind, or Storm, that &s;et us in thither. On this 18th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we coa&s;ted with a brisk Gale of the True Trade-wind at S. S. E. very &s;air and clear VVeather; but haling off in the Evening to Sea, were next Morning out of &s;ight of Land: and the

Land now trending away N. Ea&s;terly, and we being to the Norward of it, and the Wind al&s;o &s;hrinking from the S. S. E. to the E. S. E. (that is, from the True Trade-Wind to the Sea-Breeze, as the Land now lay) we could not get in with the Land again yet a-while, &s;o as to &s;ee it, tho' we trim'd &s;harp and kept clo&s;e on a Wind. We were this 19th day in Lat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">1 deg. 42 min. The 20th we were in Lat. 19 deg. 37 min. and kept clo&s;e on a Wind to get &s;ight of the Land again, but could not yet &s;ee it. We had very fair Weather; and tho' we were &s;o far from the Land as to be out of &s;ight of it, yet we had the Sea and Land-Breezes. In the Night we had the Land-breeze at S. S. E. a &s;mall gentle Gale; which in the Morn|ing about Sun-ri&s;ing would &s;hift about gradually (and withal increa&s;ing in Strength) till about Noon we &s;hould have it at E. S. E. which is the true Sea-breeze here. Then it would blow a brisk Gale, &s;o that we could &s;carce carry our Top &s;ails double rift: and it would continue thus till 3 in the Afternoon, when it would decrea&s;e again. The Weather was fair all the while, not a Cloud to be &s;een; but very hazy, e&s;pecially nigh the Horizon. We &s;ounded &s;everal times this 20th day, and at fir&s;t had no Ground: but had after|wards from 52 to 45 Fathom, cour&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="166">
brown Sand, mixt with &s;mall, brown and white Stones, with Dints be&s;ides in the Tallow.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day al&s;o we had &s;mall Land|breezes in the Night, and Sea-breezes in the day: and as we &s;aw &s;ome Sea-&s;nakes every day, &s;o this day we &s;aw a great ma|ny, of two different &s;orts or &s;hapes. One &s;ort was yellow, and about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Wri&s;t, about 4 Foot long, hav|ing a flat Tail about 4 Fingers broad. The other &s;ort was much &s;maller and &s;horter, round and &s;potted black and yel|low. This day we &s;ounded &s;everal times, and had 45 Fathom, Sand. We did not make the Land till Noon, and then &s;aw it fir&s;t from our Topma&s;t-head. It bore S.E. by E. about 9 Leagues di&s;tance; and it appeared like a Cape or Head of Land. The Sea-breeze this day was not &s;o &s;trong as the day before, and it veered out more; &s;o that we had a fair Wind to run in with to the Shore, and at Sun-&s;et anchored in 20 Fathom, clean Sand, about 5 Leagues from the bluff Point; which was not a Cape (as it appear'd at a great di&s;tance) but the Ea&s;termo&s;t end of an I&s;land, about 5 or 6 Leagues in length, and one in breadth. There were 3 or 4 Rocky I&s;lands about a I cague from us between us and the bluff Point; and we &s;aw many other I&s;lands both to the Ea&s;t and VVe&s;t of it, as
<PB N="135" REF="167">
far as we could &s;ee either way from our Topma&s;t head: And all within them to the S. there was nothing but I&s;lands of a pretty heighth, that may be &s;een 8 or 9 Leagues off. By what we &s;aw of them they mu&s;t have been a Range of I&s;lands of about 20 Leagues in length, &s;tretching from E. N. E. to VV. S. VV. and for ought I know, as far as to tho&s;e of <HI>Sharks-Bay;</HI> and to a con&s;iderable breadth al&s;o, (for we could &s;ee 9 or 10 Leagues in a|mong them) towards the Continent or main Land of <HI>N. Holland,</HI> if there be any &s;uch thing hereabouts: and by the great Tides I met with awhile afterwards, more to the N. Ea&s;t, I had a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that here might be a kind of <HI>Archipelago</HI> of I&s;lands, and a Pa&s;&s;age po&s;&s;ibly to the S. of <HI>N. Holland</HI> and <HI>N. Guinea</HI> into the great <HI>S. Sea</HI> Ea&s;tward; which I had Thoughts al&s;o of attempting in my Return from <HI>N. Guinea</HI> (had Circum&s;tances permitted) and told my Officers &s;o: but I would not at|tempt it at this time, becau&s;e we wanted VVater, and could not depend upon find|ing it there. This Place is in the Lat. of 20 deg. 21 min. but in the Draught that I had of this Coa&s;t, which was <HI>Ta&s;man</HI>'s, it was laid down in 19 deg. 50 min. and the Shore is laid down as all along joining in one Body or Continent, with &s;ome Openings appearing like Rivers; and not
<PB N="136" REF="168">
like I&s;lands, as really they are. See &s;everal Sights of it, Table IV. N^o. 8, 9, 10. This Place therefore lies more Northerly by 40 min. than is laid down in Mr. <HI>Ta&s;man</HI>'s Draught: And be&s;ide its being made a firm, continued Land, only with &s;ome Openings like the Mouths of Rivers, I &s;ound the Soundings al&s;o different from what the prickt Line of his Cour&s;e &s;hews them, and generally &s;hallower than he makes them: which inclines me to think that he came not &s;o near the Shore as his Line &s;hews, and &s;o had deeper Soundings, and could not &s;o well di&s;tingui&s;h the I&s;lands. His Meridian or Difference of Longitude from <HI>Sharks-Bay</HI> agrees well enough with my Account, which is 232 Leagues tho' we differ in Lat. And to confirm my Conje|cture that the Line of his Cour&s;e is made too near the Shore, at lea&s;t not far to the Ea&s;t of this place, the VVater is there &s;o &s;hallow that he could not come there &s;o nigh.</P>
<P>But to proceed; in the Night we had a &s;mall Land-breeze, and in the Morning I weighed Anchor, de&s;igning to run in a|mong the I&s;lands, for they had large Chan|nels between them, of a League wide at lea&s;t, and &s;ome 2 or 3 Leagues wide. I &s;ent in my Boat before to &s;ound, and if they &s;ound Shole-water to return again; but if they &s;ound Water enough, to go a|&s;hore
<PB N="137" REF="169">
on one of the I&s;lands, and &s;tay till the Ship came in; where they might in the mean time &s;earch for Water. So we followed after with the Ship, &s;ounding as we went in, and had 20 Fathom, till with|in 2 Leagues of the Bluff-head, and then we had &s;hole Water, and very uncertain Soundings: Yet we ran in &s;till with an ea|&s;ie Sail, &s;ounding and looking out well, for this was dangerous Work. When we came abrea&s;t of the Bluff-head; and about 2 Mile from it, we had but 7 Fathom: Then we Edged away from it, but had no more Water; and running in a little further, we had but 4 Fathoms: So we Anchored immediately; and yet when we had veered out a third of a Cable we had 7 Fathom Water again; &s;o uncertain was the Water. My Boat came immediately aboard, and told me that the I&s;land was ve|ry Rocky and Dry, and they had little hopes of finding Water there. I &s;ent them to &s;ound, and bad them, if they found a Channel of 8 or 10 Fathom Water, to keep on, and we would follow with the Ship. We were now about 4 Leagues within the outer &s;mall Rocky I&s;lands, but &s;till could &s;ee nothing but I&s;lands within us; &s;ome 5 or 6 Leagues long, others not above a Mile round. The large I&s;lands were pretty high; but all appeared Dry, and mo&s;tly Rocky and Barren. The Rocks look'd of
<PB N="138" REF="170">
a ru&s;ty yellow Colour, and therefore I di&s;pair'd of getting Water on any of them: but was in &s;ome hopes of finding a Channel to run in beyond all the&s;e I&s;lands, could I have &s;pent time here, and either get to the Main of <HI>New Holland,</HI> or find out &s;ome o|ther I&s;lands that might afford us Water and other Refre&s;hments: Be&s;ides, that among &s;o many I&s;lands, we might have found &s;ome &s;ort of Rich Mineral, or Ambergree&s;e, it being a good Latitude for both the&s;e. But we had not Sailed above a League far|ther before our Water grew &s;holer again, and then we Anchored in 6 Fathom hard Sand.</P>
<P>We were now on the inner &s;ide of the I&s;land, on who&s;e out&s;ide is the Bluff-point. We rode a League from the I&s;land, and I pre&s;ently went a&s;hore, and carried Shovels to dig for Water, but found none. There grow here 2 or 3 &s;orts of Shrubs, one ju&s;t like Ro&s;emary; and therefore I call'd this <HI>Ro&s;emary</HI> I&s;land. It grew in great plenty here, but had no &s;mell. Some of the o|ther Shrubs had blue and yellow Flowers; and we found 2 &s;orts of Grain like Beans: The one grew on Bu&s;hes; the other on a &s;ort of a creeping Vine that runs along on the Ground, having very thick broad Leaves, and the Blo&s;&s;om like a Bean Blo&s;|&s;om, but much larger, and of a deep red Colour, looking very Beautiful. We &s;aw
<PB N="139" REF="171">
here &s;ome Cormorants, Gulls, Crabcatch|ers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a few &s;mall Land Birds, and a &s;ort of white Parrots, which flew a great many together. We found &s;ome Shell|fi&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> Limpits, Perriwinkles, and a|bundance of &s;mall Oy&s;ters growing on the Rocks, which were very &s;weet. In the Sea we &s;aw &s;ome green Turtle, a pretty many Sharks, and abundance of Water-Snakes of &s;everal &s;orts and &s;izes. The Stones were all of ru&s;ty Colour, and Pon|derous.</P>
<P>We &s;aw a Smoak on an I&s;land 3 or 4 Leagues off; and here al&s;o the Bu&s;hes had been burned, but we found no other &s;ign of Inhabitants: 'T was probable that on the I&s;land where the Smoke was there were Inhabitants, and fre&s;h Water for them. In the Evening I went aboard, and con&s;ult|ed with my Officers whether it was be&s;t to &s;end thither, or to &s;earch among any o|ther of the&s;e I&s;lands with my Boat; or el&s;e go from hence, and Coa&s;t along Shore with the Ship, till we could find &s;ome bet|ter Place than this was to ride in, where we had &s;hole Water, and lay expos'd to Winds and Tides. They all agreed to go from hence; &s;o I gave Orders to weigh in the Morning as &s;oon as it &s;hould be light, and to get out with the Land-breeze.</P>
<P>Accordingly, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 23d. at 5 in the Morning we ran out, having a pretty
<PB N="140" REF="172">
fre&s;h Land-breeze at S. S. E. By 8 a Clock we were got out: and very &s;ea&s;onably; for before 9 the Sea-breeze came on us very &s;trong, and increa&s;ing, we took in our Top&s;ails and &s;tood off under 2 Cour&s;es and a Mizan, this being as much Sail as we could carry. The sky was clear, there being not one Cloud to be &s;een; but the Horizon appeared very hazy, and the Sun at &s;etting the Night before, and this Morning at ri|&s;ing, appeared very Red. The Wind con|tinued very &s;trong till Twelve, then it be|gan to abate: I have &s;eldom met with a &s;tronger Breeze. The&s;e &s;trong Sea-breezes la&s;ted thus in their Turns 3 or 4 Days. They &s;prung up with the Sun ri&s;e: By 9 a Clock they were very &s;trong, and &s;o con|tinued till Noon, when they began to a|bate: And by Sun-&s;et there was little Wind, or a Calm till the Land-breezes came; which we &s;hould certainly have in the Morning about 1 or 2 a Clock. The Land-breezes were between the S. S. W. and S. S. E. The Sea-breezes between the E. N. E. and N. N. E. In the Night while Calm we fi&s;h'd with Hook and Line, and caught good &s;tore of Fi&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> Snappers, Breams, Old Wives, and Dog-fi&s;h. When the&s;e la&s;t came we &s;eldom caught any others; for if they did not drive away the other Fi&s;h, yet they would be &s;ure to keep them from taking our Hooks, for they would

<P>On the 25th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we &s;till Coa&s;ted along Shore, that we might the better &s;ee any Opening; kept &s;ounding, and had a|bout 20 Fathom clean Sand. The 26th Day, being about 4 Leagues off Shore the Water began gradually to &s;holden from 20 to 14 Fathom. I was Edging in a little towards the Land, thinking to have Anchored: But pre&s;ently after the Water decrea&s;ed almo&s;t at once, till we had but 5 Fathom. I dur&s;t therefore adventure no farther, but &s;teered out the &s;ame way that we came in; and in a &s;hort time had 10 Fathom (being then about 4 Leagues and a half from the Shore) and even Sound|ings. I &s;teered away E. N. E. Coa&s;ting along as the Land lies. This Day the Sea|breezes began to be very moderate again, and we made the be&s;t of our way along Shore, only in the Night Edging off a lit|tle for fear of Sholes. Ever &s;ince we left <HI>Sharks-Bay</HI> we had had fair clear Weather, and &s;o for a great while &s;till.</P>
<P>The 27th Day, we had 20 Fathom Wa|ter all Night, yet we could not &s;ee Land till 1 in the Afternoon from our Topma&s;t-head. By 3 we could ju&s;t di&s;cern Land from our Quarter-deck: We had then 16
<PB N="142" REF="175">
Fathom. The Wind was at N. and we &s;teered E. by N. which is but one point in on the Land: Yet we decrea&s;ed our Water very fa&s;t; for at 4 we had but 9 Fathom; the next Ca&s;t but 7, which frighted us; and we then tackt in&s;tantly and &s;tood off: But in a &s;hort time the Wind coming at N. W. and W. N. W. we tackt again, and &s;teered N. N. E. and then deepned our Water a|gain, and had all Night from 15 to 20 Fa|thom.</P>
<P>The 28th Day we had between 20 and 40 Fathom. We &s;aw no Land this Day, but &s;aw a great many Snakes; and &s;ome Whales. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Boobies,</HI> and Noddy-birds; and in the Night caught one of the&s;e la&s;t. It was of another Shape and Colour than any I had &s;een before. It had a &s;mall long Bill, as all of them have, flat Feet like Ducks Feet; its Tail forked like a Swallow, but longer and broader, and the Fork deeper than that of the Swal|low, with very long Wings: The Top or Crown of the Head of this Noddy was Coal-black, having al&s;o &s;mall black Streaks round about and clo&s;e to the Eyes; and round the&s;e Streaks on each &s;ide, a pretty broad white Circle. The Brea&s;t, Belly, and under part of the Wings of this Nod|dy were white: And the Back and upper part of its Wings of a &s;aint black or &s;moak Colour. See a Picture of this, and of the

When they come about a Ship they com|monly perch in the Night, and will &s;it &s;till till they are taken by the Seamen. They Build on Cliffs again&s;t the Sea, or Rocks, as I have &s;aid Vol. I. p. 53.</P>
<P>The 30th Day being in Lat. 18 deg. 21 min. we made the Land again, and &s;aw many great Smoaks near the Shore; and having fair Weather and moderate Breezes, I &s;teered in towards it. At 4 in the After|noon I Anchored in 8 Fathom Water, clear Sand, about 3 Leagues and a half from the Shore. I pre&s;ently &s;ent my Boat to Sound nearer in, and they found 10 Fa|thom about a Mile farther in: and from thence &s;till farther in the Water decrea&s;ed gradually to 9, 8, 7. and at 2 Mile di&s;tance to 6 Fathom. This Evening we &s;aw an Eclip&s;e of the Moon, but it was abating before the Moon appear'd to us; for the Horizon was very hazy, &s;o that we could not &s;ee the Moon till &s;he had been half an hour above the Horizon: and at two hours, 22 min. after Sun-&s;et, by the reck|oning of our Gla&s;&s;es, the Eclip&s;e was quite
<PB N="144" REF="177">
gone, which was not of many Digits. The Moon's Center was then 33 deg. 40 min. high.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t of <HI>August</HI> betimes in the Morn|ing I went a&s;hore with 10 or 11 Men to &s;earch for Water. We went armed with Muskets and Cutla&s;&s;es for our Defence, ex|pecting to &s;ee People there; and carried al&s;o Shovels and Pickaxes to dig Wells. When we came near the Shore we &s;aw 3 tall black naked Men on the &s;andy Bay a|head of us: But as we row'd in, they went away. When we were landed I &s;ent the Boat with two Men in her to ly a little from the Shore at an Anchor, to prevent being &s;eiz'd; while the re&s;t of us went af|ter the 3 black Men, who were now got on the top of a &s;mall Hill about a quarter of a Mile from us, with 8 or 9 Men more in their Company. They &s;eeing us com|ing, ran away. When we came on the top of the Hill where they fir&s;t &s;tood, we &s;aw a plain Savannah, about half a mile from us, farther in from the Sea. There were &s;everal Things like Hay-cocks, &s;tanding in the Savannah; which at a di|&s;tance we thought were Hou&s;es, looking ju&s;t like the <HI>Hottentot</HI>'s Hou&s;es at the <HI>Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of G.

<PB N="145" REF="178">
Then we return'd again to the Place where we landed, and there we dug for Water.</P>
<P>While we were at work there came 9 or 10 of the Natives to a &s;mall Hill a little way from us, and &s;tood there menacing and threatning of us, and making a great Noi&s;e. At la&s;t one of them came towards us, and the re&s;t followed at a di&s;tance. I went out to meet him, and came within 50 yards of him, making to him all the Signs of Peace and Friend&s;hip I could; but then he ran away, neither would they any of them &s;tay for us to come nigh them; for we tried two or three times. At la&s;t I took two Men with me, and went in the Afternoon along by the Sea|&s;ide, purpo&s;ely to catch one of them, if I could, of whom I might learn where they got their fre&s;h Water. There were 10 or 12 of the Natives a little way off, who &s;eeing us three going away from the re&s;t of our Men, followed us at a di&s;tance. I thought they would follow us: but there being for a while a Sand-bank between us and them, that they could not then &s;ee us, we made a halt, and hid our &s;elves in a bending of the Sand-bank. They knew we mu&s;t be thereabouts, and being 3 or 4 times our Number, thought to &s;eize us. So they di&s;pers'd them&s;elves, &s;ome going to the Sea-&s;hore, and others beating about
<PB N="146" REF="179">
the Sand-hills. We knew by what Ren|counter we had had with them in the Morning that we could ea&s;ily out-run them: &s;o a nimble young Man that was with me, &s;eeing &s;ome of them near, ran towards them; and they for &s;ome time, ran away be&s;ore him. But he &s;oon over|taking them, they fac'd about and fought him. He had a Cutla&s;s, and they had Wooden Lances: with which, being ma|ny of them, they were too hard for him. When he fir&s;t ran towards them I chas'd two more that were by the Shore: but fearing how it might be with my young Man, I turn'd back quickly, and went up to the top of a Sand-hill, whence I &s;aw him near me, clo&s;ely engag'd with them. Upon their &s;eeing me, one of them threw a Lance at me, that narrowly mi&s;st me. I di&s;charg'd my Gun to &s;care them, but avoided &s;hooting any of them: till finding the young Man in great danger from them, and my &s;elf in &s;ome; and that tho' the Gun had a little frighted them at fir&s;t, yet they had &s;oon learnt to de&s;pi&s;e it, to&s;&s;ing up their Hands, and crying <HI>Pooh, Pooh, Pooh;</HI> and coming on afre&s;h with a great Noi&s;e, I thought it high time to charge a|gain, and &s;hoot one of them, which I did. The re&s;t, &s;eeing him fall, made a &s;tand a|gain; and my young Man took the op|portunity to di&s;engage him&s;elf, and come
<PB N="147" REF="180">
off to me: my other Man al&s;o was with me, who had done nothing all this while, having come out unarm'd; and I return'd back with my Men, de&s;igning to attempt the Natives no farther, being very &s;orry for what had happen'd already. They took up their wounded Companion: and my young Man, who had been &s;truck through the Cheek by one of their Lances, was afraid it had been poi&s;on'd: but I did not think that likely. His Wound was very painful to him, being made with a blunt Weapon: but he &s;oon recover'd of it.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>N. Hollanders,</HI> whom we were thus engag'd with, there was one who by his Appearance and Carriage, as well in the Morning as this Afternoon, &s;eem'd to be the Chief of them, and a kind of Prince or Captain among them. He was a young brisk Man, not very tall, nor &s;o pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;onable as &s;ome of the re&s;t, tho' more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and couragious: He was painted (which none of the re&s;t were at all) with a Circle of white Pa&s;te or Pigment (a &s;ort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ime, as we thought) about his Eyes, and a white &s;treak down his No&s;e from his Forehead to the tip of it. And his Brea&s;t and &s;ome part of his Arms were al&s;o made white with the &s;ame Paint: not for Beauty or Ornament, one would think, but as &s;ome wild <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors are &s;aid to do, he
<PB N="148" REF="181">
&s;eem'd thereby to de&s;ign the looking more terrible; this his Painting adding very much to his natural Deformity; for they all of them of the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant Looks and the wor&s;t Features of any People that ever I &s;aw, tho' I have &s;een great variety of Savages. The&s;e <HI>N. Hollanders</HI> were probably the &s;ame &s;ort of People as tho&s;e I met with on this Coa&s;t in my <HI>Voyage round the World;</HI> [See Vol. I. p. 464, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] for the Place I then touch'd at was not a|bove 40 or 50 Leagues to the N. E. of this: And the&s;e were much the &s;ame blinking Creatures (here being al&s;o abundance of the &s;ame kind of Fle&s;h-flies teizing them) and with the &s;ame black Skins, and Hair frizled, tall and thin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as tho&s;e were: But we had not the opportunity to &s;ee whether the&s;e, as the former, wanted two of their fore-Teeth.</P>
<P>We &s;aw a great many places where they had made Fires; and where there were commonly 3 or 4 Boughs &s;tuck up to Windward of them; for the Wind (which is the Sea-breeze) in the day-time blows always one way with them; and the Land-breeze is but &s;mall. By their Fire-places we &s;hould always find great heaps of Fi&s;h|&s;hells, of &s;eueral &s;orts; and 'tis probable that the&s;e poor Creatures here lived chiefly on the Shell-fi&s;h, as tho&s;e I before de&s;crib'd did on &s;mall Fi&s;h, which they caught in
<PB N="149" REF="182">
Wires or Holes in the Sand at Low-water. The&s;e gather'd their Shell-fi&s;h on the Rocks at Low-water; but had no Wires (that we &s;aw) whereby to get any other &s;orts of Fi&s;h: As among the former I &s;aw not any heaps of Shells as here, though I know they al&s;o gather'd &s;ome Shell-fi&s;h. The Lances al&s;o of tho&s;e were &s;uch as the&s;e had; however they being upon an I&s;land, with their Women and Children, and all in our Power, they did not there u&s;e them again&s;t us, as here on the Continent, where we &s;aw none but &s;ome of the Men under Head, who come out purpo&s;ely to ob&s;erve us. We &s;aw no Hou&s;es at either Place; and I believe they have none, &s;ince the for|mer People on the I&s;land had none, tho' they had all their Families with them.</P>
<P>Upon returning to my Men I &s;aw that tho' they had dug 8 or 9 Foot deep, yet found no Water. So I returned aboard that Evening, and the next day, being <HI>September</HI> 1&s;t, I &s;ent my Boat&s;wain a&s;hore to dig deeper, and &s;ent the Sain with him to catch Fi&s;h. While I &s;taid aboard I ob|&s;erved the flowing of the Tide, which runs very &s;wift here, &s;o that our Nun-buoy would not bear above the Water to be &s;een. It flows here (as on that part of <HI>N. Holland</HI> I de&s;crib'd formerly, about 5 Fathom: and here the Flood runs S. E. by S. till the la&s;t Quarter; then it &s;ets
<PB N="150" REF="183">
right in towards the Shore (which lies here S. S. W. and N. N. E.) and the Ebb runs N. W. by N. When the Tides &s;lackned we Fi&s;h'd with Hook and Line, as we had already done in &s;everal Places on this Coa&s;t; on which in this Voyage hi|therto, we had found but little Tides: but by the Heighth, and Strength, and Cour&s;e of them hereabouts, it &s;hould &s;eem that if there be &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age or Streight going through Ea&s;tward to the Great <HI>South Sea,</HI> as I &s;aid one might &s;u&s;pect, one would ex|pect to find the Mouth of it &s;omewhere between this Place and <HI>Ro&s;emary</HI> I&s;land, which was the part of <HI>N. Holland</HI> I come la&s;t from.</P>
<P>Next Morning my Men came aboard and brought a Rundlet of bracki&s;h Water which they got out of another Well that they dug in a Place a mile off, and about half as far from the Shore; but this Water was not fit to drink. However we all concluded that it would &s;erve to boil our Oatmeal, for Burgoo, whereby we might &s;ave the Remains of our other Water for drinking, till we &s;hould get more; and ac|cordingly the next day we brought aboard 4 Hog&s;heads of it: but while we were at work about the Well we were &s;adly pe&s;t|er'd with the Flies, which were more trouble&s;ome to us than the Sun, tho' it &s;hone clear and &s;trong upon us all the while
<PB N="151" REF="184">
very hot. All this while we &s;aw no more of the Natives, but &s;aw &s;ome of the Smoaks of &s;ome of their Fires at 2 or 3 miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Land hereabouts was much like that part of <HI>New Holland</HI> that I formerly de&s;cribed [Vol. I. p. 463.] 'tis low, but &s;eemingly barricado'd with a long Chain of Sand-hills to the Sea, that let's nothing be &s;een of what is farther within Land. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> high Water the Tides ri&s;ing &s;o high as they do, the Coa&s;t &s;hews very low: but when 'tis low Water it &s;eems to be of an indifferent heighth. At low Water-Mark the Shore is all Rocky, &s;o that then there is no Landing with a Boat; but at high Water a Boat may come in over tho&s;e Rocks to the Sandy Bay, which runs all along on this Coa&s;t. The Land by the Sea for about 5 or 600 yards is a dry San|dy Soil, bearing only Shrubs and Bu&s;hes of divers &s;orts. Some of the&s;e had them at this time of the year, yellow Flowers or Blo&s;&s;oms, &s;ome blue, and &s;ome white; mo&s;t of them of a very fragrant Smell. Some had Fruit like Pea&s;ecods; in each of which there were ju&s;t ten &s;mall Peas: I opened many of them, and found no more nor le&s;s. There are al&s;o here &s;ome of that &s;ort of Bean which I &s;aw at <HI>Ro&s;emary-I&s;land:</HI> and another &s;ort of &s;mall, red, hard Pul&s;e, growing in Cods al&s;o, with
<PB N="152" REF="185">
little black Eyes like Beans. I know not their Names, but have &s;een them u&s;ed of|ten in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> for weighing Gold; and they make the &s;ame u&s;e of them at <HI>Guinea,</HI> as I have heard, where the Wo|men al&s;o make Bracelets with them to wear about their Arms. The&s;e grow on Bu&s;hes: but here are al&s;o a Fruit like Beans growing on a creeping &s;ort of Shrub|like Vine. There was great plenty of all the&s;e &s;orts of Cod-fruit growing on the Sand-hills by the Sea-&s;ide, &s;ome of them green, &s;ome ripe, and &s;ome fallen on the Ground: but I could not perceive that any of them had been gathered by the Na|tives; and might not probably be whole|&s;ome Food.</P>
<P>The Land farther in, that is lower than what borders on the Sea, was, &s;o much as we &s;aw of it, very plain and even; part|ly Savannahs, and partly Woodland. The Savannahs bear a &s;ort of thin cour&s;e Gra&s;s. The Mould is al&s;o a cour&s;er Sand than that by the Sea-&s;ide, and in &s;ome places 'tis Clay. Here are a great many Rocks in the large Savannah we were in, which are 5 or 6 Foot high, and round at top like a Hay-cock, very remarkable; &s;ome red, and &s;ome white.

14 Foot high, with a Head of &s;mall Knibs or Boughs. By the &s;ides of the Creeks, e&s;|pecially nigh the Sea, there grow a few &s;mall black Mangrove-Trees.</P>
<P>There are but few Land-Animals. I &s;aw &s;ome Lizards; and my Men &s;aw two or three Bea&s;ts like hungry Wolves, lean like &s;o many Skeletons, being nothing but Skin and Bones: 'Tis probable that it was the Foot of one of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts that I mention'd as &s;een by us in <HI>N. Holland,</HI> [Vol. I. p. 463.] We &s;aw a Rackoon or two, and one &s;mall &s;peckled Snake.</P>
<P>The Land-fowls that we &s;aw here were Crows (ju&s;t &s;uch as ours in <HI>England</HI>) &s;mall Hawks, and Kites; a few of each &s;ort: but here are plenty of &s;mall Turtle-Doves, that are plump, fat and very good Meat. Here are 2 or 3 &s;orts of &s;maller Birds, &s;ome as big as Larks, &s;ome le&s;s; but not many of either &s;ort. The Sea-Fowl are Pelicans, Boobies, Noddies, Curlews, Sea-pies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and but few of the&s;e neither.</P>
<P>The Sea is plentifully &s;tock'd with the large&s;t Whales that I ever &s;aw: but not to compare with the va&s;t ones of the <HI>Nor|thern</HI> Seas. We &s;aw al&s;o a great many Green Turtle, but caught none; here be|ing no Place to &s;et a Turtle-Net in; here being no Channel for them, and the Tides running &s;o &s;trong. We &s;aw &s;ome Sharks,

and Paracoots; and with Hooks and Lines we caught &s;ome Rock-fi&s;h and Old Wives.

<P>And thus having ranged about, a con&s;i|derable time, upon this Coa&s;t, without finding any good fre&s;h Water, or any con|venient Place to clean the Ship, as I had hop'd for: And it being moreover the heighth of the dry Sea&s;on, and my Men growing Scorbutick for want of Refre&s;h|ments, &s;o that I had little Incouragement to &s;earch further; I re&s;olved to leave this Coa&s;t, and accordingly in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> &s;et Sail towards <HI>Timor.</HI></P>
