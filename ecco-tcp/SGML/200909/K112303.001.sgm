<P>MAY it plea&s;e you to pardon the Boldne&s;s of a Stranger to your Per&s;on, if upon the encouragement of Common Fame, he pre&s;umes &s;o much upon your Can|dor, as to lay before you this Account of his Travels.

kind; nor can I think this plain piece of mine, de&s;erves a place among your more Curious Collections: much le&s;s have I the Arrogance to u&s;e your Name by way of Pa|tronage for the too obvious faults, both of the Author and the Work. Yet dare I avow, according to my narrow &s;phere and poor abilities, a hearty Zeal for the promoting of u&s;eful knowledge, and of any thing that may never &s;o remotely tend to my Countries advantage: And I mu&s;t own that Ambition of tran&s;mitting to the publick through your hands, the&s;e E&s;&s;ays I have made toward tho&s;e great ends, of which you are &s;o de|&s;ervedly e&s;teemed the Patron.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the Reader proceed any further in the peru&s;al of this Work, I mu&s;t be&s;peak a little of his Patience here, to take along with him this &s;hort ac|count of it. It is compo&s;ed of a mixt relation of Places and Actions, In the &s;ame order of time in which they occurred: for which end I kept a Journal of every days Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the de&s;cription of Places, their Product, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have endeavoured to give what &s;atisfaction I could to my Countrymen; tho po&s;&s;ibly with the de&s;cribing &s;e|veral things that may have been much better account|ed for by others: Choo&s;ing to be more particular than might be needful, with re&s;pect to the intelligent Reader, rather than to omit what I thought might tend to the information of per&s;ons no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible and inqui&s;itive, tho not &s;o Learned or Experienced. For which rea&s;on, my chief care hath been to be as particular as war con&s;i&s;tent with my intended brevity, in&s;etting down &s;uch Ob&s;ervables as I met with: Nor have I given my &s;elf any great trouble &s;ince my return to compare my di&s;coveries with tho&s;e of others: The rather, becau&s;e, &s;hould it &s;o happen, that I have de&s;cribed &s;ome places or things which others have done before me, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> different accounts, even of the &s;ame things, it canhardly be but there will be &s;ome new light afforded by each of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. But after all, con&s;idering that the main of this Voyage hath its Scene laid in long Tracts of the Re+moter parts hath of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> &s;ome
<PB REF="6">
of which very &s;eldom vi&s;ited by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, and o|thers as rarely by any <HI>Europeans,</HI> I may without vani|ty encourage the Reader to expect many things wholly new to him, and many others more fully de&s;crib'd than be may have &s;een el&s;ewhere; for which not only this Voyage, tho it &s;elf of many years continuance, but al&s;o &s;everal former long and di&s;tant ones have qualified me.</P>
<P>As for the Actions of the Company, among whom I made the greate&s;t part of this Voyage, a Thread of which I have carried on thro it, 'tis not to divert the Reader with them that I mention them, much le&s;s that I take any plea&s;ure in relating them: but for methods &s;ake, and for the Readers &s;atisfaction; who could not &s;o well acquie&s;ce in my de&s;cription of Places, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without knowing the particular Traver&s;es I made among them; nor in the&s;e, without an account of the Concomitant Circum&s;tances. Be&s;ides that, I would not prejudice the truth and &s;incerity of my Relation, tho by omi&s;&s;ions only. And as for the Traver&s;es them&s;elves they make for the Readers advantage, how little &s;o|ever &s;or mine; &s;ince thereby I have been the better enabled to gratify his Curio&s;ity; as one who rambles about a Country can give u&s;ually a better account of it, than a Carrier who jogs on to his Inn, without ever going out of his Road.</P>
<P>As to my Stile, it cannot be expected, that a Seaman &s;hould affect Politene&s;s; for were I able to do it, yet I think I &s;hould be little &s;ollicitous about it, in a work of this Nature. I have frequently indeed dive&s;ted my &s;elf of Sea Phra&s;es, to gratify the Land Reader; for which the Seamen will hardly forgive me: And yet po&s;|&s;ibly I &s;hall not &s;eem Complai&s;ant enough to the other, becau&s;e I &s;till retain the u&s;e of &s;o many Sea terms. I con&s;e&s;s I have not been at all &s;crupulous in this mat|ter, either as to the one or the other of the&s;e; for I am per&s;waded, that if what I &s;ay be intellig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> matters not greatly in what words it is expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on I have not been curious art
<PB REF="7">
the &s;pelling of the Names of Places, Plants, Fruits, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which in many of the remoter parts are given at the plea&s;ure of Travellers, and vary ac|cording to their different Humours: Neither have I confined my &s;elf to &s;uch Names as are given by Learned Authors, or &s;o much as enquired after many of them. I write for my Countrymen, and have there|fore for the mo&s;t part u&s;ed &s;uch Names as are fami+liar to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen, and tho&s;e of our Colonies abroad, yet without neglecting others that occurr'd. As it may &s;uffice me to have given &s;uch Names and De|&s;criptions as I could, I &s;hall leave to tho&s;e of more lei&s;ure and opportunity, the trouble of comparing them with tho&s;e which other Authors have a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The Reader will find as he goes along, &s;ome Re|ferences to an Appendix, which I once de&s;igned to this Book; as to a Chapter about the Winds in di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|ferent parts of the World, to a de&s;cription of the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> where I lived long in a former Voyage; and to a particular Chorogra|phical de&s;cription of all the <HI>South Sea</HI> Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> partly from a <HI>Spani&s;h MSS,</HI> and partly from my own and other Travellers Ob&s;ervations, be&s;ide tho&s;e con|tained in this Book. But &s;uch an Appendix would have &s;welled it too unrea&s;onably: and therefore I cho&s;e rather to publi&s;h it hereafter by its &s;elf, as op|portunity &s;hall &s;erve. And the &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;aid a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;o to a particular Voyage from <HI>Achin</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> to <HI>Tonquin, Malacca,</HI> &amp;c. which &s;hould have been in&s;erted as part of this General one; but it would have been too long; and therefore omitting it for the pre&s;ent, I have carried on this, next way from <HI>Sumatra</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> and &s;o made the <HI>Tour</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> corre&s;pondent to the <HI>Title.</HI></P>
<P>For the better apprehending the Cour&s;e of the Voyage, and the Situation of the Places mentioned in it, I have cau&s;ed &s;everal Maps to be engraven,
<PB REF="8">
and &s;ome particular Draughts of my own Compo&s;ure. A|mong them, there is in the Map of the <HI>American I&s;th|mus,</HI> a new Scheme of the adjoining Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> and its I&s;lands, which to &s;ome may &s;eem &s;uperfluous after that which Mr <HI>Ringro&s;e</HI> hath publi&s;hed in the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Buccaneers;</HI> and which he offers as a very exact Draught. I mu&s;t needs di&s;agree with him in that, and doubt not but this which I here publi&s;h will be found more agreeable to that Bay, by any who &s;hall have opportunity to examine it; for it is a contraction of a larger Map, which I took from &s;everal Stations in the Bay it &s;elf. The Reader may judge how well I was able to do it, by my &s;everal Traver&s;es a|bout it mentioned in this Book; tho&s;e particularly, which are de&s;cribed in the 7th Chapter, which I have cau&s;ed to be marked out with a pricked Line: as the Cour&s;e of my Voyage is generally in all the Maps, for the Readers more ea&s;y tracing it.</P>
<P>I have nothing more to add, but that there are here and there &s;ome mi&s;takes made, as to expre&s;&s;ion and the like, which will need a favourable Correction as they occur up|on reading. For in&s;tance, the Log of Wood lying out at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ides of the Boats de&s;cribed at <HI>Guam,</HI> and parallel to their Keel, which for di&s;tinctions &s;ake, I have called the little Boat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> might more clearly and properly have been called the &s;ide Log, or by &s;ome &s;uch name; for though f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ned at the bottom and ends Boat|wi&s;e, yet is not hollow at top, but &s;olid throughout. In other places al&s;o I may not have ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;s'd my &s;elf &s;o fully as I ought; but any con&s;iderable Omi&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n that I &s;hall recollect, or be informed of, I &s;hall endeavour to make it up in tho&s;e Accounts I have yet to publi&s;h; and for any faults, I leave the Reader to the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">int u&s;e of his Judgment and Candour.</P>

Commander. I went a Pa&s;&s;enger, de&s;igning when I came thither, to go from thence to the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to cut Log-wood: where in a former Voyage I had &s;pent about three years in that employ; and &s;o was well accquainted with the place and the work.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed with a pro&s;perous gale without any impediment, or remarkable pa&s;&s;age in our Voyage: unle&s;s that when we came in &s;ight of the I&s;land <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and were coa&s;ting along on the South &s;ide of it, by the little I&s;les of <HI>Vacca</HI> or <HI>A&s;h,</HI> I ob&s;erved Captain <HI>Knapman</HI> was more vigilant than ordinary, keeping at a good di&s;tance off &s;hoar, for fear of coming too near tho&s;e &s;mall low &s;lands; as he did once in a Voyage from <HI>England,</HI> about the year 1673, lo&s;ing his Ship there, by the care|le&s;sne&s;s of his Mates. But we &s;ucceeded better; and arrived &s;afe at <HI>Port Royol</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> &s;ome time in <HI>April</HI> 1679, and went immediately a&s;hoar.</P>
<P>I had brought &s;ome goods with me from <HI>England,</HI> which I intended to &s;ell here, and &s;tock my &s;elf with Rum and Sugar, Saws, Axes, Hats, Stock|ings, Shoes, and &s;uch other Commodities, as I knew would &s;ell among the <HI>Campeachy</HI> Log-wood|cutters. Accordingly I &s;old my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cargo at <HI>Port Royal;</HI> but upon &s;ome maturer con&s;iderations of my intended Voyage to <HI>Campeachy,</HI> I changed my thoughts of that de&s;ign, and continued at <HI>Ja|maica</HI> all that year, in expectation of &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with my Ob&s;er|vations at that I&s;le, &s;o well known to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men: nor with the particulars of my own Affairs during my &s;tay there. But in &s;hort, having there made a purcha&s;e of a &s;mall E&s;tate in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> near my Native Country of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> of one who&s;e Title of

it I was well a&s;&s;ured of; I was ju&s;t embarking my &s;elf for <HI>England</HI> about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1679, when one Mr <HI>Hobby</HI> invited me to go fir&s;t a &s;hort Trading Voyage to the Country of the <HI>Moskito's,</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in my fir&s;t Chapter. I was willing to get up &s;ome Money before my return, having laid out what I had at <HI>Jamaica;</HI> &s;o I &s;ent the VVriting of my new Purcha&s;e along with the &s;ame Friends whom I &s;hould have accompanied to <HI>England,</HI> and went on board Mr <HI>Hobby.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after our &s;etting out we came to an anchor again in <HI>Negril</HI> Bay, at the We&s;t end of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> but finding there Captain <HI>Soxon, Sawkings, Sharp,</HI> and other Privateers, Mr <HI>Hobby</HI>'s men all left him to go with them, upon an expedition they had contrived, leaving not one with him be&s;ide my &s;elf; and being thus left alone, after 3 or 4 days &s;tay with Mr <HI>Hobby,</HI> I was the more ea&s;ily per&s;waded to go with them too.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1680" UNIT="year"> It was &s;hortly after <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1679, when we &s;et out.

In about nine days march we arrived at <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> and took it, and after a &s;tay there of about three days, we went on to the <HI>South Sea</HI> Coa&s;t, and there embarked our &s;elves in &s;uch Canoas and Periago's, as our <HI>Indian</HI> friends furni&s;hed us withal. We were in &s;ight of <HI>Panama</HI> by the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> and having in vain attempted <HI>Puebla Nova,</HI> before which <HI>Sawkings,</HI>

<P>An Account of the Authors Return out of the <HI>South Sea,</HI> to his Landing near <HI>Cape St Lawrence,</HI> in the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien:</HI> With an Occa&s;ional De&s;crip|tion of the <HI>Moskito Indians.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>APril</HI> the 17th 1681. about Ten a Clock in the morning, being 12 Leagues N. W. from the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> we left Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> and tho&s;e who were willing to go with him in the Ship, and embarked into our Lanch and Ca|noas, de&s;igning for the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>St Michael,</HI> which is about 200 leagues from the I&s;le of <HI>Plata.</HI> We were in number 44 white Men who bore Arms, a <HI>Spani&s;h Indian,</HI> who bore Arms al&s;o: and two <HI>Moskito Indians,</HI> who al|ways
<PB N="2" REF="19">
bear Arms among&s;t the Privateers, and are much valued by them for &s;triking Fi&s;h and Turtle, or Tortoi&s;e and Manatee or Sea Cow; and five Slaves taken in the South Sas, who fell to our &s;hare.</P>
<P>The Craft which carried us was a Lanch, or Long Boat, one Canoa, and another Canoa which had been &s;awn a&s;under in the middle, in order to have made Bumkins, or Ve&s;&s;els for carrying water, if we had not &s;eparated from our Ship. This we joyn'd to|gether again and made it tight; providing Sails to help us along: And for 3 days before we parted, we &s;ifted &s;o much Flower as we could well carry, and rubb'd up 20 or 30 pound of Chocolate with Sugar to &s;weeten it; the&s;e things and a Kettle the Slaves carried al&s;o on their backs after we landed. And becau&s;e there were &s;ome who de&s;igned to go with us that we knew were not well able to march, we gave out, that if any man faultred in the Journey over Land, he mu&s;t expect to be &s;hot to death; for we knew that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would &s;oon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> after us, and one man falling into their hands might be the ruin of us all, by giving an account of our &s;trength and condition: yet this would not de'er 'em from going with us. We had but little Wind when we parted from the Ship; but before 12 a clock the Sea-breeze came in &s;trong which was like to founder us before we got in with the &s;hore; for our &s;ecurity therefore, we cut up an old dry Hide that we brought with us, and barricadoed the Lanch all round with it to keep the water out. About 10 a clock at night we got in about 7 leagues to wind|ward of Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao</HI> under the <HI>Line,</HI> and then it proved calm; and we lay and drove all night, be|ing fatigued the preceeding day. The 18th day we had little wind till the afternoon; and then we made &s;ail, &s;tanding along the &s;hore to the North-ward, having the wind at S. S. W. and fair wea|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="20">
At 7 a clock we came abre&s;t of Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao,</HI> and found a &s;mall Bark at an Anchor in a &s;mall Bay to Leeward of the Cape, which we took, our own Boats being too &s;mall to tran&s;port us. We took her ju&s;t under the Equinoctial Line; &s;he was not only a help to us, but in taking her we were &s;afe from being de&s;cribed: we did not de&s;ign to have meddled with any when we parted with our con&s;orts, nor to have &s;een any if we could have helped it. The Bark came from <HI>Gallio</HI> laden with Timber, and was bound for <HI>Guiaquil.</HI></P>
<P>The 19th day in the morning we came to an an|chor about 12 leagues to the Southward of Cape <HI>St Franci&s;co,</HI> to put our new Bark into a better trim. In 3 or 4 hours time we fini&s;hed our bu&s;ine&s;s, and came to &s;ail again, and &s;teered along the Coa&s;t with the Wind at S. S. W. intending to touch at <HI>Gorgonia.</HI></P>
<P>Being to the Northward of Cape <HI>St Franci&s;co</HI> we met with very wet weather; but the Wind conti|nuing we arrived at <HI>Gorgonia</HI> the 24th day in the morning, before it was light; we were afraid to approach it in the day time, for fear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould lie there for us, it being the place where we careened lately, and where they might expect us.</P>
<P>When we came a&s;hore we found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had been there to &s;eek after us, by a Hou&s;e they had built, which would entertain 100 Men, and by a great Cro&s;s before the Doors. This was token e|nough that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did expect us this day a|gain; therefore we examined our Pri&s;oners if they knew any thing of it, who confe&s;&s;ed they had heard of a Pereago, (or a large Canoa) that row'd with 14 Oars, which was kept on the River on the Main, and once in 2 or 3 days came over to <HI>Gor|gonia</HI> purpo&s;ely to &s;ee for us, and that having di&s;|covered us, &s;he was to make all &s;peed to <HI>Panama</HI> with the News; where they had 3 Ships ready to &s;end after us.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="21">
We lay here all the day, and &s;crubb'd our new Bark, that if ever we &s;hould be cha&s;ed we might the better e&s;cape: we filled our Water, and in the evening went from thence, having the Wind at S. W. a brisk gale.</P>
<P>The 25th day we had much Wind and Rain, and we lo&s;t the Canoa that had been cut and was join|ed together; we would have kept all our Canoas to carry us up the River, the Bark not being &s;o convenient.</P>
<P>The 27th day we went from thence with a mo|derate gale of Wind at S W. In the afternoon we had exce&s;&s;ive &s;howers of Rain.</P>
<P>The 28th day was very wet all the morning; be|twixt 10 or 11 it cleared up, and we &s;aw two great Ships about a league and half to the We&s;t|ward of us, we being then two leagues from the &s;hore, and about 10 leagues to the Southward of point <HI>Garrachina.</HI> The&s;e Ships had been crui&s;ing between <HI>Gorgonia</HI> and the Gulf 6 months; but whe|ther our Pri&s;oners did know it I cannot tell.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently furled our Sails, and rowed in clo&s;e under the &s;hore, knowing that they were Crui&s;ers; for if they had been bound to <HI>Panama</HI> this Wind would have carried them thither; and no Ships bound from <HI>Panama</HI> come on this &s;ide the Bay, but keep the North &s;ide of the Bay till as far as the Keys of <HI>Quibo</HI> to the We&s;tward; and then if they are bound to the Southward they &s;tand over and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ay &s;etch <HI>Gallco,</HI> or betwixt it and Cape <HI>St. Franci&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>The Glare did not continue long before it rained again, and kept us from the &s;ight of each other: but if they had &s;een and chaced us, we were re&s;ol|ved to run our Bark and Canoas a&s;hore, and take our &s;elves to the Mountains and travel over Land; for we knew that the <HI>Indians</HI> which lived in the&s;e parts never had any Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> &s;o we might have had a chance for our Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="22">
The 29th day, at 9 a clock in the morning, we came to an Anchor at Point <HI>Garrachina,</HI> about 7 leagues from the Gulph of <HI>St Michael,</HI> which was the place were we fir&s;t come into the South Seas, and the way by which we de&s;igned to return.</P>
<P>Here we lay all the day, and went a&s;hore and dried our Cloaths, clean'd our Guns, dried our Am|munition, and fixt our &s;elves again&s;t our Enemies, if we &s;hould be attack'd; for we did expect to find &s;ome oppo&s;ition at Landing: we likewi&s;e kept a good Look-out all the day, for fear of tho&s;e two Ships they &s;aw the day before.</P>
<P>The 30th day in the morning at 8 a Clock we came into the Gulf of <HI>St Michael</HI>'s mouth; for we put from Point <HI>Garrachina</HI> in the Evening, de&s;ign|ing to have reach'd the I&s;lands in the Gulf before day; that we might the better work our e&s;cape from our Enemies, if we &s;hould find any of them waiting to &s;top our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>About 9 a clock we came to an Anchor a mile without a large I&s;land, which lies 4 miles from the mouth of the River; we had other &s;mall I&s;lands without us, and might have gone up into the Ri|ver, having a &s;trong tyde of flood, but would not adventure farther till we had lookt well about us.</P>
<P>We immediately &s;ent a Canoa a&s;hoar on the I&s;land, where we &s;aw (what we always feared) a Ship at the mouth of the River, lying clo&s;e by the &s;hore, and a large Tent by it, by which we found it would be a hard task for us to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>When the Canoa came aboard with this news, &s;ome of our men were a little di&s;heartned; but it was no more than I ever expected.</P>
<P>Our care was now to get &s;afe over land, &s;eeing we could not land here according to our de&s;ire: Therefore before the Tyde of flood was &s;pent, we manned our Canoa and rowed again to the I&s;land to &s;ee if the Enemy was yet in motion. When we
<PB N="6" REF="23">
came a&s;hoar we di&s;per&s;ed our &s;elves all over th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> I&s;land, to prevent our Enemies from coming any way to view us: and pre&s;ently after high-water we &s;aw a &s;mall Canoa coming over from the Ship to the I&s;land that we were on, which made us all get into our Canoa, and wait their coming; and we lay clo&s;e till they came within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of us, and then being ready, we &s;tarted out and took them; there were in her one white man and two <HI>Indians,</HI> who being examined, told us that the Ship which we &s;aw at the Rivers mouth, had lain there &s;ix months, guarding the River, waiting for our coming; that &s;he had 12 Guns and 150 Seamen and Souldiers; that the Seamen all lay aboard, but the Souldiers lay a&s;hore in their Tents; that there were 300 men in the Mines, who had all &s;mall Arms, and would be abroad in two Tydes time; they likewi&s;e told us, that there were two Ships crui&s;ing in the Bay, between this place and <HI>Gorgonia;</HI> the bigge&s;t had 20 Guns, and 200 Men, the other 10 Guns, and 150 Men: Be&s;ides all this, they told us that the <HI>Indians</HI> on this &s;ide the Coun|try were our Enemies, which was the wor&s;t news of all. However we pre&s;ently brought the&s;e Pri|&s;oners aboard, and got under &s;ail, turning out with the Tyde of Ebb, for it was not convenient to &s;tay longer there.</P>
<P>We did not long con&s;ider what to do, but in|tended to land that night, or the next day betimes; for we did not que&s;tion but we &s;hould either get a good commerce with the <HI>Indians,</HI> by &s;uch toys as we had purpo&s;ely brought with us, or el&s;e force our way through their Country, in &s;pight of all their oppo&s;ition: and we did not fear what the&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> could do again&s;t us, in ca&s;e they &s;hould land and come after us. We had a &s;trong Souther|ly Wind, which blew right in; and the Tyde of Ebb being far &s;pent, we could not turn out.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="24">
I per&s;waded them to run into the River of <HI>Congo</HI> which is a large River, about three leagues from the I&s;lands where we lay; which with a Southerly Wind we could have done: and when we were got &s;o high as the Tide flows, then we might have landed. But all the arguments I could u&s;e were not of force &s;ufficient to convince them that there was a large River &s;o near us, but they would land &s;omewhere, they neither did know how, where, nor when.</P>
<P>When we had rowed and towed again&s;t the wind all night; we ju&s;t got about Cape <HI>St. Lorenzo</HI> in the morning, and &s;ailed about 4 miles farther to the We&s;tward, and run into a &s;mall Creek with|in two Keys, or little I&s;lands, and rowed up to the head of the Creek, being about a mile up, and there we landed <HI>May</HI> 1. 1681.</P>
<P>We got out all our Provi&s;ion and Cloaths, and then &s;unk our Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>While we were landing, and fixing our Snap|&s;acks to march, our <HI>Moskito Indians</HI> &s;truck a plen|tiful di&s;h of Fi&s;h, which we immediately dre&s;t, and therewith &s;atisfied our hunger.</P>
<P>Having made mention of the <HI>Moskito Indians,</HI> it may not be ami&s;s to conclude this Chapter with a &s;hort account of them. They are tall, well made, raw boned, lu&s;ty, &s;trong, and nimble of foot, long vi&s;aged, lank black hair, look &s;tern, hard fa|voured, and of a dark Copper-colour Complexion. They are but a &s;mall Nation or Family, and not 100 men of them in number, inhabiting on the Main, on the North &s;ide, near Cape <HI>Gratia Dios;</HI> between Cape <HI>Honduras</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua.</HI> They are very ingenious at throwing the Lance, Fi&s;gig, Har|poon, or any manner of Dart, being bred to it from their Infancy, for the Children imitating their Pa|rents, never go abroad without a Lance in their hands, which they throw at any object, till u&s;e hath
<PB N="8" REF="25">
made them ma&s;ters of the Art. Then they learn to put by a Lance, Arrow or Dart; the manner is thus. Two Boys &s;tand at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and Dart a blunt &s;tick at one another, each of them holding a &s;mall &s;tick in his right hand, with which he &s;trikes away that which was darted at him. As they grow in years they become more dexterous and courageous, and then they will &s;tand a fair mark to any one that will &s;hoot Arrows at them; which they will put by with a very &s;mall &s;tick, no bigger than the rod of a Fowling-piece; and when they are grown to be men, they will guard them|&s;elves from Arrows, tho they come very thick at them, provided two do not happen to come at once. They have extraordinary good Eyes, and will di&s;cry a Sail at Sea farther, and &s;ee any thing better than we. Their chiefe&s;t Employment in their own Country is to &s;trike Fi&s;h, Turtle or Manatee; the manner of which I de&s;cribe el&s;e|where, Chap. 3. For this they are e&s;teemed and co|veted by all Privateers; for one or two of them in a Ship will maintain 100 men. So that when we careen our Ships, we choo&s;e commonly &s;uch places, where there is plenty of Turtle or Manatee for the&s;e <HI>Mos|kito</HI> men to &s;trike; and it is very rare to find Pri|vateers de&s;titute of one or more of them, when the Commander, or mo&s;t o&s; the men are <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but they do not love the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> they hate mortally. When they come among Pri|vateers, they get the u&s;e of Guns, and prove very good Marks-men: They behave them&s;elvis very bold in fight, and never &s;eem to flinch nor hang back; for they think that the white men with whom they are, know better than they do when it is be&s;t to fight; and let the di&s;advantage of their party be never &s;o great, they will never yield not give back while any of their party &s;tand. I could never perceive any Religion nor any Ceremonies,
<PB N="9" REF="26">
or &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervations among them, being ready to imitate us in what&s;oever they &s;aw us do at any time. Only they &s;eem to fear the Devil, whom they call <HI>Walle&s;aw;</HI> and they &s;ay he often appears to &s;ome among them, whom our men commonly call their Prie&s;ts, when they de&s;ire to &s;peak with him on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s; but the re&s;t know not any thing of him, nor how he appears, otherwi&s;e than as the&s;e Prie&s;ts tell them. Yet they all &s;ay they mu&s;t not anger him, for then he will beat them, and that &s;ometimes he carries away the&s;e their Prie&s;ts. Thus much I have heard from &s;ome of them who &s;peak good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>They marry but one Wife, with whom they live till death &s;eperates them. At their fir&s;t coming to|gether the man makes a very &s;mall Plantation, for there is Land enough, and they may choo&s;e what &s;pot they plea&s;e. They delight to &s;ettle near the Sea, or by &s;ome River, for the &s;ake of &s;triking Fi&s;h, their beloved Employment.</P>
<P>Far within Land there are other <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom they are always at War. After the man hath cleared a &s;pot of Land, and hath planted it, he &s;eldom minds it afterward, but leaves the ma|naging of it to his Wife, and he goes out a &s;triking: Sometimes he &s;eeks only for Fi&s;h, at other times for Turtle or Manatee, and whatever he gets he brings home to his Wife, and never &s;tirs out to &s;eek for more till it is all eaten. When hunger begins to bite, he either takes his Canoa and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s for more game at Sea, or walks out into the Woods and hunts about for Peccary, Warree, each a &s;ort of wild Hogs or Dear, and &s;eldom returns empty handed, nor &s;eeks for any more &s;o long as any of it la&s;ts. Their Plantations are &s;o &s;mall, that they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with what they produce; for their large&s;t Plantations have not above 20 or 30 Plan|tain-Trees, a bed of Yams and Potatoes, a bu&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="27">
of <HI>Indian</HI> Pepper, and a &s;mall &s;pot of Pine-apples which la&s;t fruit is a main thing they delight in, for with the&s;e they make a &s;ort of drink which our men call Pine-drink, much e&s;teemed by the&s;e <HI>Mos|kito</HI>'s, and to which they invite each other to be merry, providing Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h al&s;o. Whoever of them makes of this Liquor treats his Neighbours, making a little Canoa full at a time, and &s;o enough to make them all drunk; and it is &s;eldom that &s;uch Fea&s;ts are made, but the party that makes them hath &s;ome de&s;ign, either to be revenged for &s;ome injury done him, or to debate of &s;uch differences as have happened between him and his Neighbours, and to examin into the truth of &s;uch Matters. Yet before they are warmed with drink, they never &s;peak one word of their grievances; and the Wo|men, who commonly know their Husbands de&s;igns, prevent them from doing any injury to each other by hiding their Lances, Harpoons, Bows and Ar|rows, or any other weapon that they have.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Moskito</HI>'s are in general very civil and kind to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> of whom they receive a great deal o&s; re&s;pect, both when they are aboard their Ships, and al&s;o a&s;hore, either in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or el&s;e|where, whither they often come with the Seamen. We always humour them, letting them go any where as they will, and return to their Country in any Ve&s;&s;el bound that way if they plea&s;e. They will have the management of them&s;elves in their &s;triking, and will go in their own little Canoa, which our men could not go in without danger of ever&s;etting; nor will they then let any white man come into their Canoa, but will go a &s;triking in it ju&s;t as they plea&s;e: All which they allow them. For &s;hould we cro&s;s them, tho they &s;hould &s;ee Shoals of Fi&s;h, or Turtle, or the like, they will purpo&s;ely &s;tride their Harpoons and Turtle irons a&s;ide, or &s;o glance them as to kill nothing. They have no form
<PB N="11" REF="28">
of Government among them, but acknowledge the King of <HI>England</HI> for their Soveraign: They learn our Language, and take the Governour of <HI>Ja|maica</HI> to be one of the greate&s;t Princes in the World.</P>
<P>While they are among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> they wear good Cloaths, and take delight to go neat and tight; but when they return again to their own Country they put by all their Cloaths, and go after their own Country fa&s;hion, wearing only a &s;mall piece of Linnen tyed about their wa&s;tes, hanging down to their knees.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Author's <HI>Land Journey</HI> from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North Sea,</HI> over the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> or I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEing landed, <HI>May</HI> the 1&s;t, we began our march about 3 a Clock in the afternoon, directing our cour&s;e by our Pocket Compa&s;&s;es N. E. and having gone about 2 miles, we came to the foot of a Hill where we built &s;mall Huts and lay all night; having exce&s;&s;ive Rains till 12 a Clock.</P>
<P>The 2d day in the morning having &s;air weather we a&s;cended the Hill, and found a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> path, which we followed till we found it ran too much Ea&s;terly, and then doubting it would carry us out of our way, we climb'd &s;ome of the highe&s;t Trees on the Hill, which was not meanly furni&s;hed with as large tall Trees as ever I &s;aw: At length we di&s;covered &s;ome Hou&s;es in a Valley on the North &s;ide of the Hill, but it being &s;teep could
<PB N="12" REF="29">
not de&s;cend on that &s;ide, but followed the &s;mall path which led us down the Hill on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, where we pre&s;ently found &s;everal other <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es. The fir&s;t that we came to at the foot of the Hill, had none but women at home, who could not &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> but gave each of us a good Cala|ba&s;h or Shell full of Corn-drink. The other Hou&s;es had &s;ome men at home, but none that &s;poke <HI>Spa|ni&s;h;</HI> yet we made &s;hift to buy &s;uch food as their Hou&s;es or Plantations afforded, which we dre&s;t, and eat altogether, having all &s;orts of our Provi|&s;ion in common, becau&s;e none &s;hould live better than others, or pay dearer for any thing than it was worth. This day we had marched 6 mile.</P>
<P>In the evening the Husbands of tho&s;e women came home, and told us in broken <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> that they had been on board of the Guard Ship, which we fled from two days before, that we were now not above 3 mile from the mouth of the River <HI>Congo,</HI> and that they could go from thence aboard the Guard Ship in half a Tydes time.</P>
<P>This evening we &s;upped plentifully on Fowls, and Pecary, a &s;ort of wild Hogs which we bought of the <HI>Indins;</HI> Yams, Potatoes and Plantains &s;erved us for Bread, whereof we had enough. After Sup|per we agreed with one of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> to guide us a days march into the Country, towards the North &s;ide; he was to have for his pains a Hatchet, and his bargain was to bring us to a certain <HI>Indians</HI> ha|bitation, who could &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> from whom we were in hopes to be better &s;atisfied of our Journey.</P>
<P>The 3d day having fair weather, we began to &s;tir betimes, and &s;et out batween 6: nd 7 a clock, marching through &s;everal old ruined Plantations. This morning one of our men being tired gave us the &s;lip. By 12 a Clock we had gone 8 mile, and arrived at the <HI>Indians</HI> hou&s;e, who lived on the bank of the River <HI>Congo,</HI> and &s;poke very good <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> to

<P>At fir&s;t he &s;eemed to be very dubious of enter|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ining any di&s;cour&s;e with us, and gave very im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ertinent an&s;wers to the que&s;tions that we demand|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d of him; he told us he knew no way to the North &s;ide of the Country, he could carry us to <HI>Cheapo</HI> or <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> which we knew to be <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons, the one lying to the Ea&s;tward of us, the other to the We&s;tward: either of them at lea&s;t 20 miles out of our way. We could get no o|ther an&s;wer from him, and all his di&s;cour&s;e was in &s;uch an angry tone, as plainly declared he was not our friend. However, we were forced to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and humour him, for it was neither time nor place to be angry with the <HI>Indians;</HI> all our lives lying in their hands.</P>
<P>We were now at a great lo&s;s, not knowing what cour&s;e to take, for we tempted him with Beads, Money, Hatchets, Macheats, or long Knives; but nothing would work on him, till one of our men took a Sky-coloured Petticoat out of his bag and put it on his Wife; who was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the Pre&s;ent, that &s;he immediately began to chatter at her Husband, and &s;oon brought him into a better humour. He could then tells us he knew the way to the North &s;ide, and would have gone with us, but that he cut his foot 2 days before, which made him uncapable of &s;erving us him&s;elf: But he would take care that we &s;hould not want a guide; and therefore he hired the &s;ame <HI>Indian</HI> who brought us hither, to conduct us 2 days march further for another Hatchet. The old man would have &s;tayed us here all the day, becau&s;e it rained very hard; but our bu&s;ine&s;s required more ha&s;te, our Enemies lying &s;o near us, for he told us that he could go from his hou&s;e aboard the Guard-Ship in a Tydes time; and this was the 4th day &s;ince they &s;aw us, &s;o we marched 3 mile farther,
<PB N="14" REF="31">
and then built Hutts, where we &s;tayed all night; it rained all the afternoon, and greate&s;t part of the night,</P>
<P>The 4th day we began our march betimes, for the forenoons were commonly fair, but much rain afternoon: tho whether it rained or &s;hined it was much at one with us, for I verily believe we cro&s;t the Rivers 30 times this day: the <HI>Indians</HI> having no paths to travel from one part of the Country to another: and therefore guided them&s;elves by the Rivers. We marched this day 12 miles, and then built our Hutts and lay down to &s;leep; but we al|ways kept two men on the watch, otherwi&s;e our own Slaves might have knockt us on the head while we &s;lept. It rained violently all the afternoon, and mo&s;t part of the night. We had much ado to kindle a fire this evening, our Hutts were but very mean and ordinary. and our fire &s;mall, &s;o that we could not dry our Cloaths, &s;carce warm our &s;elves, and no &s;ort of food for the Belly; all which made it very hard with us, I confe&s;s the&s;e hard&s;hips quite expell'd the thoughts of an Enemy; for now having been 4 days in the Country we began to have but few other cares than how to get Guides and Food, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;eldom in our thoughts.</P>
<P>The 5th day we &s;et out in the morning betimes, and having travell'd 7 miles in tho&s;e wild pathle&s;s Woods, by 10 a clock in the morning we arrived at a young <HI>Spani&s;h Indian</HI>'s Hou&s;e who had former|ly lived with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Panama.</HI> The young <HI>Indian</HI> was very brisk, &s;poke very good <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and received us very kindly. This Plantation afforded us &s;tore of Provi&s;ion, Yams, and Potaroes, but no|thing of any fle&s;h, be&s;ide 2 fat Monkeys we &s;hot, part whereof we di&s;tributed to &s;ome of our Com|pany who were weak and &s;ickly; for others we got Eggs, and &s;uch refre&s;hments as the <HI>Indians</HI> had, for we &s;till provided for the &s;ick and weak. We
<PB N="15" REF="32">
had a <HI>Spani&s;h Indian</HI> in our company, who fir&s;t took up Arms with Captain <HI>Sawkins,</HI> and had been with us ever &s;ince his death. He was per&s;waded to live here by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who promi&s;ed him his Si&s;ter in marriage, and to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him in clearing a Plantation; but we would not con&s;ent to part ftom him here, for fear of &s;ome treachery, but promi&s;ed to relea&s;e him in two or three days, when we were certainly out of danger of our Enemies. We &s;tayed here all the Afternoon and dryed our Cloaths and Ammunition, cleared our Guns, and provided our&s;elves for a march the next morning.</P>
<P>Our Chyrurgeon, Mr <HI>Wa&s;er,</HI> came to a &s;ad di&s;|a&s;ter here: being drying his Powder, a carele&s;s fel|low pa&s;&s;ed by with his Pipe lighted, and &s;et fire to his Powder, which blew up and &s;corch'd his Knee; and reduced him to that condition, that he was not able to march; wherefore we allowed him a Slave to carry his things, being all of us the more concern'd at the accident, becau&s;e lyable our &s;elves every moment to misfortune, and none to look after us but him. This <HI>Indian</HI> Plantation was &s;eated on the bank of the River <HI>Congo,</HI> in a very fat Soyl; and thus far we might have come in our Canoa, if I could have per&s;waded them to it.</P>
<P>The 6th day we &s;et out again, having hired ano|ther guide. Here we fir&s;t cro&s;t the River <HI>Congo</HI> in a Canoa, having been from our fir&s;t Landing on the We&s;t &s;ide of the River; and being over, we march|ed to the Ea&s;tward 2 mile, and came to another River, which we forded &s;everal times, though it was very deep. Two of our men were not able to keep company with us, but came after us as they were able. The la&s;t time we forded the River, it was &s;o deep, that our talle&s;t men &s;tood in the deep|e&s;t place, and handed the &s;ick, weak, and &s;hort men; by which means we all got over &s;afe, ex|cept
<PB N="16" REF="33">
tho&s;e two who were behind. Fore&s;eeing a nece&s;&s;ity of wading through Rivers frequently in our Land-march, I took care before I left the Ship to provide my &s;elf a large Joint of Bambo, which I &s;topt at both ends, clo&s;ing it with Wax, &s;o as to keep out any Water. In this I pre&s;erved my Jour|nal and other Writings from being wet, tho I was often forced to &s;wim. When we were over this River we &s;at down to wait the coming of our Con&s;orts who were left behind, and in half an hour they came. But the River by that time was &s;o high, that they could not get over it, neither could we help them over, but bid them be of good comfort and &s;tay till the River did fall, But we marched 2 mile farther by the &s;ide of the River, and there built our Hutts, having gone this day 6 miles. We had &s;carce fini&s;hed our Hutts before the River ro&s;e much higher, and over-flowing the Banks, obliged us to remove into higher ground: But the next night came on before we could build more Hutts, &s;o we lay &s;traggling in the Woods, &s;ome under one Tree, &s;ome under another, as we could find conveniency, which might have been in|different comfortable if the weather had been fair, but the greate&s;t part of the night we had extraor|dinary hard Rain, with much Lightening and terri|ble claps of Thunder. The&s;e hard&s;hips and incon|veniencies made us all carele&s;s, and there was no Watch kept, (tho I believe no body did &s;leep:) So our Slaves taking opportunity, went away in the night; all but one, who was hid in &s;ome hole and knew nothing of their de&s;ign, or el&s;e fell a&s;leep. Tho&s;e that went away: carried with them our Chy|rurgeons Gun and all his Money.</P>
<P>The next morning being the 8th day, we went to the Rivers &s;ide, and found it much fallen; and here our Guide would have us ford it again, which being deep, and the current running &s;wift, we could
<PB N="17" REF="34">
not. Then we contrived to &s;wim over, tho&s;e that could not &s;wim, we were re&s;olved to help over as well as we could: But this was not feizable: for we &s;hould not be able to get all our things over. At length we concluded to &s;end one man over with a Line, who &s;hould hale over all our things fir&s;t, and then get the men over. This be|ing agreed on, one <HI>George Gayny</HI> took the end of a Line, and made it fa&s;t about his neck, and left the other end a&s;hore, and one man &s;tood by the Line to clear it away to him. But when <HI>Gayny</HI> was in the mid&s;t of the water, the Line in drawing after him chanc'd to kink, or grow entangled; and he that &s;tood by to clear it away, &s;topt the Line, which turned <HI>Gayny</HI> on his back, and he that had the Line in his hand threw it all into the River after him, thinking he might recover him&s;elf, but the &s;tream running very &s;wift, and the man having three hundred Dollars at his back, was carried down, and never &s;een more by us. Tho&s;e two men whom we left behind the day before, told us afterwards that they found him lying dead in a Creek, where the Eddy had driven him a&s;hore, and the Money on his back; but they meddled not with any of it, being only in care how to work their way thro a wild unknown Country. This put a period to that contrivance. This was the fourth man that we lo&s;t in this Land Journey; for tho&s;e two men that we left the day before, did not come to us till we were in the <HI>North Seas,</HI> &s;o we yielded them al&s;o for lo&s;t. Being fru&s;trated of getting over the River this way, we lookt about for a Tree to fell acro&s;s the River. At length we found one, which we cut down, and it reached clear over: on this we pa&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide, where we found a &s;mall Planta in-walk, which we &s;oon ran&s;ackt.</P>
<P>While we were bu&s;y getting Plantains, our Guide was gone, but in le&s;s than two hours came to us
<PB N="18" REF="35">
again, and brought with him an old <HI>Indian,</HI> to whom he delivered up his charge; and we gave him a Hatchet and di&s;mi&s;t him, and entred our &s;elves under the conduct of our new Guide, who imme|diately led us away, and cro&s;t another River, and enter'd into a large Valley of the fatte&s;t Land I did ever take notice of: the Trees were not very thick, but the large&s;t that I &s;aw in my Travels: we &s;aw great tracks which were made by the Pecaries, but &s;aw none of'em. We marched in this plea&s;antCoun|try till 3 a Clock in the afternoon, in all about 4 Miles, and then arrived at the old man's Country-hou&s;e, which was only a Habitation for Hunting: there was a &s;mall Plantain walk, &s;ome Yams and Potatoes. Here we took up our quarters for this day, and refre&s;hed our &s;elves with &s;uch food as the place afforded, and dryed our Cloaths and Ammu|nition. At this place our <HI>Indian</HI> provided to leave us, for now we thought our &s;elves pa&s;t danger. This was he that was per&s;waded to &s;tay at the la&s;t Hou&s;e we came from, to marry the young man's Si&s;ter; and we di&s;mi&s;s'd him according to our pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>The 9th day the old man conducted us towards his own habitation. We marched about 5 miles in this Valley, and then a&s;cended a Hill, and travel led about 5 miles farther over two or three &s;mall Hills, before we came to any &s;ettlement. Half a mile before we came to the Plantations, we light of a path, which carried us to the <HI>Indians</HI> habitation. We &s;aw many wooden Cro&s;&s;es erected in the way, which created &s;ome jealou&s;y in us that here were &s;ome <HI>Spaniards:</HI> Therefore we new primed all our Guns, and provided our &s;elves for an Enemy; but coming into the Town found none but <HI>Indians,</HI> who were all got together in a large hou&s;e to receive us: for the old man had a little boy with him, that he &s;ent before.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="36">
They made us welcome to &s;uch as they had, which was very mean; for the&s;e were new Planta|tions, the Corn being not eared. Potatoes, Yams, and Plantains they had none, but what they brought from their old Plantations. There was none of them &s;poke good <HI>Spani&s;h:</HI> Two young men could &s;peak a little; it cau&s;ed us to take more notice of them. To the&s;e we made a pre&s;ent, and de&s;ired them to get us a Guide to conduct us to the North &s;ide, or part of the way, which they promi&s;ed to do them&s;elves, if we would reward them for it, but told us we mu&s;t lye &s;till the next day. But we thought our &s;elves nearer the North Sea than we were, and propo&s;ed to go without a Guide, rather than &s;tay here a whole day. However, &s;ome of our men who were tired, re&s;olved to &s;tay behind; and Mr <HI>Wafer</HI> our Chyrurgeon, who marched in great pain ever &s;ince his Knee was burned with powder, was re&s;olved to &s;tay with them.</P>
<P>The tenth day we got up betimes re&s;olving to march, but the <HI>Indians</HI> oppo&s;ed it as much as they could, but &s;eeing they could not per&s;wade us to &s;tay, they came with us; and having taken leave of our friends, we &s;et out.</P>
<P>Here therefore we left the Chyrurgeon and two more, as we &s;aid, and marched away to the Ea&s;t|ward following our Guides. But we often look'd on our Pocket Compa&s;&s;es, and &s;hewed them to the Guides, pointing at the way that we would go, which made them &s;hake their heads, and &s;ay, they were pretty things, but not convenient for us Af|ter we had de&s;cended the Hills on which the Town &s;tood, we come down into a Valley, and guided our &s;elves by a River, which we cro&s;&s;ed 32 times; and having marched 9 miles, we built Hutts and lay there all night. This evening I killed a Quaum, a large Bird as big as a Turkey, wherewith we treated our Guides, for we brought no Provi&s;ion
<PB N="20" REF="37">
with us. This night our Slave run away.</P>
<P>The eleventh day we marched 10 miles farther, and built Hutts at night; but went &s;upperle&s;s to bed.</P>
<P>The twelfth in the morning we cro&s;&s;ed a deep River, pa&s;&s;ing over it on a Tree, and marched 7 mile in a low &s;wampy ground: and came to the &s;ide of a great deep River, but could not get over. We built Hutts upon its Banks and lay there all night, upon our Barbecu's, or frames of Sticks rai&s;ed a|bout 3 foot from the ground.</P>
<P>The thirteenth day, when we turned out, the River had overflow'd its Banks, and was 2 foot deep in our Hutts, and our Guides went from us not tel|ling us their intent, which made us think they were returned home again. Now we began to repent our ha&s;te in coming from the la&s;t &s;ettlements, for we had no food &s;ince we came from thence. Indeed we got Macaw-berries in this place, wherewith we &s;atisfied our &s;elves this day, though cour&s;ly.</P>
<P>The fourteenth day in the morning betimes, our Guides came to us again; and the Waters being fallen within their bounds, they carried us to a Tree that &s;tood on the Bank of the River, and told us if we could fell that Tree cro&s;s it, we might pa&s;s; if not we could pa&s;s no further. Therefore we &s;et two of the be&s;t Ax men that we had, who fell'd it exactly cro&s;s the River, and the boughs ju&s;t reached over; on this we pa&s;&s;ed very &s;afe. We afterwards cro&s;&s;ed another River three times, with much difficulty, and at 3 a clock in the afternoon we came to an <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ettlement, where we met a drove of Monkeys, and kill'd 4 of them, and &s;tay|ed here all night; having marched this day 6 miles. Here we got Plantains enough, and a kind recepti|on of the <HI>Indian</HI> that lived here all alone, except one Boy to wait on him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38">
The fifteeenth day when we &s;et out, the kind <HI>Indian</HI> and his Boy went with us in a Canoa, and &s;et us over &s;uch places as we could not ford: and being pa&s;t tho&s;e great Rivers, he returned back a|gain, having helped us at lea&s;t 2 mile. We marched afterwards 5 mile, and came to large Plantain walks, where we took up our quarters that night; we there fed plentifully on Plantains, both ripe and green, and had fair weather all the day and night. I think the&s;e were the large&s;t Plantain walks, and the bigge&s;t Plantains that ever I &s;aw, but no hou&s;e near them: We gathered what we plea&s;ed by our Guides orders.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth day we marched 3 mile, and came to a large &s;ettlement, where we abode all day: Not a man of us but wi&s;ht the Journey at an end; our Feet being bli&s;tered, and our Thighs &s;tript with wading through &s;o many Rivers; the way being al|mo&s;t continually through Rivers or pathle&s;s Woods. In the afternoon five of us went to &s;eek for game, and kill'd 3 Monkeys, which we dre&s;t for Supper. Here we fir&s;t began to have fair weather, which continued with us till we came to the North Seas.</P>
<P>The eighteenth day we &s;et out at 10 a Clock, and the <HI>Indians</HI> with 5 Canoas carried us a league up a River; and when we landed, the kind <HI>Indians</HI> went with us and carried our burthens. We march|ed 3 mile farther and then built our Hutts, having travelled from the la&s;t &s;ettlements 6 miles.</P>
<P>The nineteenth day our Guides lo&s;t their way, and we did not march above 2 miles.</P>
<P>The twentieth day by 12 a Clock we came to <HI>Cheapo</HI> River. The Rivers we cro&s;t hitherto run all into the South Seas; and this of <HI>Cheapo</HI> was the la&s;t we met with that run that way. Here an old man who came from the la&s;t &s;ettlements, de&s;tribu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his burthen of Plantains among&s;t us, and taking his leave returned home. Afterwards we forded the River
<PB N="22" REF="39">
and marched to the foot of a very high Mountain, where we lay all night. This day we marched a|bout 9 miles.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> returned back, and we marched up a very high mountain; being on the top we went &s;ome miles on a ridge, and &s;teep on both &s;ides; then de&s;cended a little and came to a fine Spring, where we lay all night, having gone this day about 9 miles, the weather &s;till very fair and clear.</P>
<P>The 22d day we marched over another very high Mountain, keeping on the ridge 5 miles. When we came to the North end, we, to our great comfort, &s;aw the Sea; then we de&s;cended and parted our &s;elves into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Companies, and lay by the &s;ide of a River, which was the fir&s;t we met that runs into the North Sea.</P>
<P>The 23d day we came through &s;everal large Plan|tain walks, and at 10 a clock came to an <HI>Indians</HI> habitation, not far from the <HI>North Sea.</HI> Here we got Canoas to carry us down the River <HI>Conception</HI> to the Sea &s;ide; having gone this day 7 miles. We found a great many <HI>Indians</HI> at the mouth of this River. They had &s;ettled them&s;elves here, for the be|nefit of Trade with the Privateers; and their Com|modities were Yams, Potatoes, Plantains, Sugar, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">es, Fowls and Eggs.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> told us, that there had been a great many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ships here, which were all gone but one <HI>Barco-longo,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Privateer that lay at <HI>La Sounds</HI> Key or I&s;land. This I&s;land is about; leagues from the mouth of the River <HI>Conception,</HI> and is one of the <HI>Samballoes,</HI> a range of I&s;lands reaching for about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> leagues, from point <HI>Samballas</HI> to <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+den I&s;land</HI> Ea&s;tward. The&s;e I&s;lands or Keys, as we call them, were fir&s;t made the Rendezvous of Pri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eers in the year 1679, being very convenient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing, and had names given to &s;ome of
<PB N="23" REF="40">
them by the Captains of the Privateers; as this <HI>La Sounds</HI> Key particularly.</P>
<P>Thus we fini&s;hed our Journey from the <HI>South Sea</HI> to the <HI>North</HI> in 23 days; in which by my ac|count we travelled 110 miles, cro&s;&s;ing &s;ome very high Mountains; but our common march was in the Valleys among deep and dangerous Rivers. At our fir&s;t landing in this Country, we were told that the <HI>Indians</HI> were our Enemies; we knew the Rivers to be deep, the wet &s;ea&s;on to be coming in; yet, excepting tho&s;e we left behind, we lo&s;t but one man, who was drowned as I &s;aid. Our fir&s;t land|ing place on the South Coa&s;t was very di&s;advanta|geous, for we travell'd at lea&s;t fifty miles more than we need to have done, could we have gone up <HI>Cheapo</HI> River, or <HI>Santa Maria</HI> River; for at either of the&s;e places a man may pa&s;s from Sea to Sea in 3 days time with ea&s;e. The <HI>Indians</HI> can do it in a day and a half, by which you may &s;ee how ea&s;y it is for a party of men to travel over. I mu&s;t confe&s;s the <HI>Indians</HI> did a&s;&s;i&s;t us very much, and I que&s;tion whether ever we had got over without their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, becau&s;e they brought us from time to time to their Plantations, where we always got Provi&s;i|on, which el&s;e we &s;hould have wanted. But if a party of 500 or 600 men, or more, were minded to travel from the North to the South Seas, they may do it without asking leave of the <HI>Indians;</HI> tho it be much better to be friends with them.</P>
<P>On the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> (having lain one night at the Rivers mouth) we all went on board the Privateer, who lay at <HI>La Sounds</HI> Key. It was a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el Captain <HI>Tri&s;tian</HI> Commander. The fir&s;t thing we did was to get &s;uch things as we could to gratifie our <HI>Indian</HI> Guides, for we were re&s;olved to reward them to their hearts content. This we did by gi|ving them Beads, Knives, Sci&s;&s;ars and Looking-gla&s;&s;es, which we bought of the Privateers Crew;
<PB N="24" REF="41">
and a half Dollar a man from each of us; which we would have be&s;towed in goods al&s;o, but could not get any, the Privateer having no more toys. They were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the&s;e, that they return'd with joy to their friends; and were very kind to our Con&s;orts whom we left behind, as Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI> our Chyrurgeon and the re&s;t of them told us, when they came to us &s;ome months afterwards, as &s;hall be &s;aid hereafter.</P>
<P>I might have given a further account of &s;everal things relating to this Country; the <HI>In-land</HI> parts of which are &s;o little known to the <HI>Europeans.</HI> But I &s;hall leave this province to Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI> who made a longer abode in it than I, and is better able to do it that any man than I know; and is now preparing a particular De&s;cription of this Country for the Pre&s;s.</P>

lay up <HI>Carpenters</HI> River, which is about 60 leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Portabell.</HI> Our greate&s;t ob&s;tructi|on in this de&s;ign was our want of Boats: therefore it was concluded to go with all our Fleet to St <HI>An|dreas,</HI> a &s;mall uninhabited I&s;land lying near the I&s;le of <HI>Providence,</HI> to the We&s;tward of it in 13 deg. 15 m.

This <HI>Blewfields</HI> River comes out between the Ri|vers of <HI>Nicuragua</HI> and <HI>Veragua.</HI> At its mouth is a fine &s;andy Bay; where Barks may clean: It is deep at its mouth, but a &s;hoal within; &s;o that Ships may not enter, yet Barks of 60 or 70 Tuns may. It had this name from Captain <HI>Blewfield,</HI> a famous Priva|teer living on <HI>Providence</HI> I&s;land long before <HI>Jamaica</HI> was taken. Which I&s;land of <HI>Providence</HI> was &s;ettled by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and belonged to the Earls of <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>In this River we found a Canoa coming down the &s;tream; and tho we went with our Canoas to &s;eek for Inhabitants, yet we found none, but &s;aw in 2 or 3 places &s;igns that <HI>Indians</HI> had made on that &s;ide the River. The Canoa which we found was but meanly made for want of Tools, therefore we concluded the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> have no commerce with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor with other <HI>Indians</HI> that have.</P>
<P>While we lay here our <HI>Moskito</HI> men went in their Canoa, and &s;truck us &s;ome Manatee, or Sea-cow. Be&s;ides this <HI>Blewfields</HI> River, I have &s;een of the Manatee in the Bay of <HI>Campechy,</HI> on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bocca del Drago,</HI> and <HI>Bocca del Toro,</HI> in the River of <HI>Darien,</HI> and among the South Keys or little I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba.</HI> I haveheard of there being found on the North of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> a few, and in the Rivers of <HI>Surinam</HI> in great multitudes, which is a very low Land. I have &s;een of them al&s;o at <HI>Mindanao</HI> one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-Holland.</HI> This Creature is about the bigne&s;s of a Hor&s;e, and 10 or 12 foot long. The mouth of it is much like the mouth of a Cow, having great thick lips. The Eyes are no bigger than a &s;mall Pea, the Ears are only 2 &s;mall holes on each &s;ide of the head. The Neck is &s;hort and thick, bigger than the Head. The bigge&s;t part of this Creature is at the Shoul|ders, where it hath 2 large Fins one on each &s;ide of its Belly. Under each of the&s;e Fins the Female hath a &s;mall Dug to &s;uckle her young. From the
<PB N="34" REF="52">
Shoulders towards the Tayl it retains its bigne&s;s for about a foot, then it groweth &s;maIler and &s;maller to the very Tayl, which is flat, and about 14 inches broad, and 20 inches long, and in the middle 4 or 5 inches thick, but about the edges of it not above 2 inches thick. From the Head to the Tayl it is round and &s;mooth without any Fin but tho&s;e two before mentioned. I have heard that &s;ome have weighed above 1200 <HI>l.</HI> but I never &s;aw any &s;o large. The Manatee delights to live in a bracki&s;h Water; and they are commonly in Creeks or Rivers near the Sea. 'Tis for this rea&s;on po&s;&s;ibly they are not &s;een in the South Seas (that ever I could ob&s;erve) where the Coa&s;t is generally a bold Shoar, that is, high Land and deep Water clo&s;e home by it, with a high Sea or great Surges; except in the Bay of <HI>Pa|nama:</HI> yet even there is no Manatee. Whereas the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> being as it were one great Bay compo|&s;ed of many &s;maller, are mo&s;tly low Land and &s;hoal Water, and afford proper pa&s;ture (as I may &s;ay) for the Manatee. Sometimes we find them in Salt Wa|ter, &s;ometimes in fre&s;h; but never far at Sea. And tho&s;e that live in the Sea at &s;uch places where there is no River nor Creek fit for them to enter, yet do commonly come once or twice in 24 hours to the mouth of any fre&s;h water River, that is near their place of abode. They live on Gra&s;s 7 or 8 inches long, and of a narrow blade, which grows in the Sea in many places, e&s;pecially among I&s;lands near the Main. This Gra&s;s groweth likewi&s;e in Creeks, or in great Rivers, near the &s;ides of them, in &s;uch, places where there is but little tyde or current. They never come a&s;hoar, nor into &s;hallower water than where they can &s;wim. Their fle&s;h is white, both the fat and the lean, and extraordinary &s;weet whole&s;ome meat. The tayl of a young Cow is mo&s;t e&s;teem'd; but if old, both head and tayl are very tough. A Calf that &s;ucks is the mo&s;t delicate meat:
<PB N="35" REF="53">
Privateers commonly roa&s;t them; as they do al&s;o great pieces cut out of the Bellies of the old ones.</P>
<P>The Skin of the Manatee is of great u&s;e to Priva|teers, for they cut them into &s;traps, which they make fa&s;t on the &s;ide of their Canoas, thro' which they put their Oars in rowing, in&s;tead of tholes or pegs. The Skin of the Bull, or of the Back of the Cow is too thick for this u&s;e; but of it they make Hor&s;e-whips, cutting them 2 or 3 foot long: at the handle they leave the full &s;ub&s;tance of the Skin, and from thence cut it away tapering, but very even and &s;quare all the four &s;ides. While the Thongs are green they twi&s;t them, and hang them to dry: which in a weeks time become as hard as Wood. The <HI>Moskito-men</HI> have always a &s;mall Canoa for their u&s;e to &s;trike Fi&s;h, Tortoi&s;es or Manatee, which they keep u&s;ually to them&s;elves, and very neat and clean. They u&s;e no Oars, but Paddles, the broad part of which doth not go tapering towards the &s;taff, pole, or &s;handle of it, as in the Oar; nor do they u&s;e it in the &s;ame manner, by laying it on the &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el; but hold it perpendicularly, griping the &s;taff hard with both hands, and put|ting back the water by main &s;trength, and very quick &s;troaks. One of the <HI>Moskitoes</HI> (for there go but 2 in a Canoa) &s;its in the &s;tern, the other kneels down in the head, and both paddle till they come to the place where they expect their game. Then they lye &s;till or paddle very &s;oftly, looking well about them, and he that is in the head of the Canoa lays down his paddle, and &s;tands up with his &s;triking &s;taff in his hand. This &s;taff is about 8 foot long, almo&s;t as big as a man's Arm, at the great end, in which there is hole to place his Harpoon in. At the other end of his &s;taff there is a piece of light wood called Bobwood, with a hole in it, through which the &s;mall end of the &s;taff comes; and on this piece of Bobwood there is a line of 10 or 12 fa|thom
<PB N="36" REF="54">
wound neatly about, and the end of the line made fa&s;t to it. The other end of the line is made fa&s;t to the Harpoon, which is at the great end of the &s;taff, and the <HI>Moskito</HI> man keeps about a fathom of it loo&s;e in his hand. When he &s;trikes, the Har|poon pre&s;ently comes out of the &s;taff, and as the Ma|natee &s;wims away, the line runs off from the bob; and altho at fir&s;t both &s;taff and bob may be carried under water, yet as the line runs off it will ri&s;e a|gain. Then the <HI>Moskito</HI> men paddle with all their might to get hold of the bob again, and &s;pend u&s;u|ally a quarter of an hour before they get it. When the Manatee begins to be tired, it lieth &s;till, and then the <HI>Moskito</HI> men paddle to the bob and take it up, and begin to hale in the line. When the Manatee feels them he &s;wims away again with the Canoa after him; then he that &s;teers mu&s;t be nim|ble to turn the head of the Canoa that way that his con&s;ort points, who being in the head of the Canoa, and holding the line, both &s;ees and feels which way the Manatee is &s;wimming. Thus the Ca|noa is towed with a violent motion, till the Ma|natee's &s;trength decays. Then they gather in the line, which they are often forced to let all go to the very end. At length when the Creatures &s;trength is &s;pent, they hale it up to the Canoas &s;ide, and knock it on the head, and tow it to the neare&s;t &s;hore where they make it fa&s;t, and &s;eek for another; which having taken, they go a&s;hore with it, to put it into their Canoa: For it is &s;o heavy that they cannot lift it in, but they hale it up in &s;hoal water as near the &s;hore as they can, and then over&s;et the Canoa, laying one &s;ide clo&s;e to the Manatee. Then they roll it in, which brings the Canoa upright a|gain; and when they have heav'd out the water, they fa&s;ten a line to the other Manatee that lieth a|flout, and tow it after them. I have known two <HI>Moskito</HI> men for a week every day bring aboard two
<PB N="37" REF="55">
Manatee in this manner; the lea&s;t of which hath not weighed le&s;s than 600 pound, and that in a very &s;mall Canoa, that 3 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men would &s;carce ad|venture to go in. When they &s;trike a Cow that hath a young one, they &s;eldom mi&s;s the Calf, for &s;he commonly takes her young one under one of her Fins. But if the Calf is &s;o big that &s;he cannot carry it, or &s;he &s;o frighted that &s;he only minds to &s;ave her own life, yet the young never leaves her till the <HI>Moskito</HI> men have an opportunity to &s;trike her.</P>
<P>The manner of &s;triking Manatee and Tortoi&s;e is much the &s;ame; only when they &s;eek for Manatee they paddle &s;o gently, that they make no noi&s;e, and never touch the &s;ide of the Canoa with their paddle, becau&s;e it is a creature that hears very well. But they are not &s;o nice when they &s;eek for Tortoi&s;e, who&s;e Eyes are better than his Ears. They &s;trike the Tortoi&s;e with a &s;quare &s;harp Iron peg, the other with a Harpoon. The <HI>Moskito</HI> men make their own &s;triking In&s;truments as Harpoons, Fi&s;h|hooks, and a Tortoi&s;e-Iron or Pegs. The&s;e Pegs, or Tortoi&s;e-Irons are made 4 &s;quare, &s;harp at one end, and not much above an inch in length, of &s;uch a figure as you &s;ee in the Margin.<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> The &s;mall &s;pike at the broad end hath the line fa&s;ten'd to it, and goes al&s;o into a hole at the end of the &s;triking &s;taff: which when the Tortoi&s;e is &s;truck flies off, the Iron and end of the line fa&s;tened to it going quite within the Shells where it's &s;o buried, that the Tortoi&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape.</P>
<P>They make their lines both for Fi&s;hing and Stri|king with the bark of <HI>Maho;</HI> which is a &s;ort of Tree or Shrub that grows plentifully all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and who&s;e Bark is made up of &s;trings, or threads very &s;trong. You may draw it off either in flakes or &s;mall threads, as you have occa&s;ion. 'Tis fit for any manner of Cordage; and Privateers often make

<P>When we had cleaned our Tartane we &s;ail'd from hence bound for <HI>Bocca-toro,</HI> which is an opening between 2 I&s;lands about 10 Deg. 10 Min. North Lat. between the Rivers of <HI>Veragne</HI> and <HI>Chagre.</HI> Here we met with Captain <HI>Yanky,</HI> who told us that there had been a Fleet of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armadilloes to &s;eek us: that Captain <HI>Tri&s;tian</HI> having fallen Leeward, was coming to <HI>Bocca-toro,</HI> and fell in among&s;t them, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be our Fleet: that they fired and cha&s;ed him, but he rowed and towed, and they &s;up|po&s;ed he got away: that Capt. <HI>Pain</HI> was likewi&s;e chaced by them, and Capt. <HI>Williams;</HI> and that they had not &s;een them &s;ince they lay within the I&s;lands: that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never came in to him; and that Captain <HI>Coxon</HI> was in at the careening place.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bocca-toro</HI> is a place that the Privateers u&s;e to re&s;ort to, as much as any place on all the Coa&s;t, be|cau&s;e here is plenty of green Tortoi&s;e, and a good careening place. The <HI>Indians</HI> here have no com|merce with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but are very barbarous and will not be dealt with. They have de&s;troyed many Privateers, as they did not long after this &s;ome of Captain <HI>Pain</HI>'s men; who having built a Tent a&s;hore to put his goods in while he careened his Ship, and &s;ome men lying there with their Arms, in the night the <HI>Indians</HI> crept &s;oftly into the Tent, and cut off the heads of 3 or 4 men, and made their e&s;cape; nor was this the fir&s;t time they had &s;erved the Privateers &s;o. There grow on this Coa&s;t <HI>Vinelloes</HI> in great quantity, with which Chocolate is perfumed. The&s;e I &s;hall de&s;cribe el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Our Fleet being thus &s;cattered, there was now no hopes of getting together again; therefore every one did what they thought mo&s;t conducing to ob|tain their ends. Capt. <HI>Wright,</HI> with whom I now was, was re&s;olved to crui&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Carta|gene;</HI> and it being now almo&s;t the We&s;terly wind
<PB N="39" REF="57">
&s;ea&s;on, we &s;ailed from hence, and Captain <HI>Yanky</HI> with us; and we con&s;orted, becau&s;e Captain <HI>Yanky</HI> had no Commi&s;&s;ion, and was afraid the <HI>French</HI> would take away his Bark. We pa&s;t by <HI>Scuda,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land (where tis &s;aid Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s bowels were bury'd) and came to a &s;mall River to the We&s;tward of <HI>Chagre;</HI> where we took two new Canoas, and car|ry'd them with us into the <HI>Sambaloes.</HI> We had the Wind at We&s;t, with much rain; which brought us to <HI>Point Samballas.</HI> Here Captain <HI>Wright</HI> and Cap|tain <HI>Yanky</HI> left us in the Tartane to fix the Conoas, while they went on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagene</HI> to &s;eek for provi&s;ion. We crui&s;ed in among the I&s;lands, and kept our <HI>Moskito-men,</HI> or &s;trikers out, who brought aboard &s;ome half-grown Tortoi&s;e; and &s;ome of us went a&s;hoar every day to hunt for what we could find in the Woods: Sometimes we got <HI>Pecary, Warree,</HI> or Deer; at other times we light on a drove of large fat Monkeys, or <HI>Quames, Corro&s;oes,</HI> (each a large &s;ort of Fowl) Pidgeons, Parrots, or Tuttle|doves. We liv'd very well on what we got, not &s;taying long in one place; but &s;ometimes we would go on the I&s;lands, where there grow great Groves of <HI>Sapadillies,</HI> which is a &s;ort of Fruit much like a Pear, but more juicy; and under tho&s;e Trees we found plenty of Soldiers, that live in Shells, a little kind of Animals, and have two great Claws like a Crab, and are good food. One time our men &s;ound a great many large ones, and being &s;harp &s;et had them dre&s;t, but mo&s;t of them were very &s;ick afterwards, being poy&s;oned by them: For on this I&s;land were many <HI>Manchaneel</HI> Trees, who&s;e Fruit is like a &s;mall Crab, and &s;mells very well, but they are not whole&s;ome; and we commonly take care of meddling with any Animals that eat them. And this we take for a general rule; when we find any Fruits that we have not &s;een before, if we &s;ee them peck'd by Birds, we may freely eat, but if we &s;ee
<PB N="40" REF="58">
no &s;uch &s;ign, we let them alone; for of this Fruit no Birds will ta&s;te. Many of the&s;e I&s;lands have of the&s;e <HI>Manchaneel-Trees</HI> growing on them.</P>
<P>Thus crui&s;ing in among the&s;e I&s;lands, at length we came again to <HI>La Sound</HI>'s <HI>Key;</HI> and the day be|fore having met with a <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sloop that was come over on the Coa&s;t to trade, &s;he went with us. It was in the evening when we came to an Anchor, and the next morning we fir'd 2 Guns for the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> that lived on the Main for to come aboard; for by this time we concluded we &s;hould hear from our 5 men, that we left in the heart of the Country a|mong the <HI>Indians,</HI> this being about the latter end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and it was in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> when we parted from them. According to our expectati|on the <HI>Indians</HI> came aboard, and brought our friends with them: Mr <HI>Wafer</HI> wore a Clout about him, and was painted like an <HI>Indian;</HI> and he was &s;ome time aboard before I knew him. One of them, named <HI>Riehard Cob&s;on,</HI> dyed within 3 or 4 days af|ter, and was buried on <HI>La Sound</HI>'s <HI>Key.</HI></P>
<P>After this we went to other Keys, to the Ea&s;t|ward of the&s;e to meet Captain <HI>Wright</HI> and Captain <HI>Yanky,</HI> who met with a Fleet of Pereagos laden with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Hog and Fowls, going to <HI>Carta|gene;</HI> being conveyed with a &s;mall Armadilly of 2 Guns and 6 Patereroes.

<P>Here Captain <HI>Wright</HI>'s and Captain <HI>Yanky</HI>'s Barks were clean'd; and we &s;tock'd our &s;elves with Corn and then went towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagene.</HI> In our way thither we pa&s;&s;ed by the River of <HI>Darien;</HI> which is very broad at the mouth but not above 6 foot water on a Spring tyde; for the Tyde ri&s;eth but little here.

The <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sloops u&s;ed of|ten to come over to trade here: and I am informed that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have again &s;ettled them&s;elves in it, and made it very &s;trong. We entered the Fort and brought 2 &s;mall Guns aboard. From thence we went to the <HI>Rancheries,</HI> one or 2 &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Villages, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> kept 2 Barks to fi&s;h for Pearl. The Pearl-banks lye about 4 or 5 leagues off from the &s;hoar, as I have been told; thither the Fi&s;hing Barks go and Anchor; then the Divers go down to the bottom, and fill a Basket (which is let down before) with Oy&s;ters; and when they come up, others go down, 2 at a time; this they do till the Bark is full, and then go a&s;hoar, where the Old men, Women and Children of the <HI>Indians,</HI> open the Oy&s;ters, there being a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Over|&s;eer to look after the Pearl.

Barks, and &s;aw great heaps of Oy&s;ter-&s;hells, but the people all fled: Yet in another place, between this and <HI>Rio la Hacha,</HI> we took &s;ome of the <HI>Indians;</HI> who &s;eem to be a &s;tubborn &s;ort of people: They are long-vi&s;aged, black hair, their no&s;es &s;omewhat ri|&s;ing in the middle, and of a &s;tern look.

The Land is but barren, it being of a light &s;and near the Sea; and mo&s;t <HI>Savanah,</HI> or Champion; and the gra&s;s but thin and cour&s;e, yet they feed plenty of Cattel. Every man knoweth his own, and looketh after them: but the Land is in common except only their Hou&s;es or &s;mall Plantations where they live, which every man maintains with &s;ome fence about it.

<P>When we had &s;pent &s;ome time here, we return'd again towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagene;</HI> and being be|tween <HI>Rio Grande</HI> and that place, we met with We&s;terly Winds, which kept us &s;till to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Cartagene</HI> 3 or 4 days; and then in the morning we de&s;cryed a Sail off at Sea, and we chaced her at noon: Captain <HI>Wright</HI> who &s;ail'd be&s;t, came up with her, and engaged her; and in half an hour after, Captain <HI>Yankey,</HI> who &s;ailed better than the Tartan (the Ve&s;&s;el that I was in) came up with he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

likewi&s;e, and laid her aboard, then Captain <HI>Wright</HI> al&s;o; and they took her before we came up. They lo&s;t 2 or 3 men, and had 7 or 8 wounded. The Prize was a Ship of 12 Guns and 40 men, who had all good &s;mall Arms: She was laden with Sugar and Tobacco, and had 8 or 10 Tuns of Marmalet on board: She came from <HI>Saint Jago</HI> on <HI>Cuba,</HI> and was bound to <HI>Cartagene.</HI></P>
<P>We went back with her to <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> to fix our Rigging, which was &s;hattered in the Fight, and to con&s;ider what to do with her; for the&s;e were com|modities of little u&s;e to us, and not worth going into a Port with.

<P><HI>Queri&s;ao</HI> is the only I&s;land of importance that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have in the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> It is about 5 leagues in length, and may be 9 or 10 in circumference: the Northermo&s;t point is laid down in North lat. 12 d. 40 m. and it is about 7 or 8 leagues from the Main, near Cape <HI>Roman.</HI> On the South &s;ide of the Ea&s;t end is a good Harbour called <HI>Santa Barbara;</HI> but the chiefe&s;t harbour is about 3 leagues from the S.

Ships bound in thither mu&s;t be &s;ure to keep clo&s;e to the Harbours mouth, and have a Ha&s;ar or Rope ready to &s;end one end a&s;hoar to the Fort: for there is no Anchoring at the entrance of the Harbour, and the Current always &s;ets to the We&s;tward. But being got in, it is a very &s;ecure Port for Ships, either to Careen, or lye &s;afe. At the Ea&s;t end are two hills, one of them is much higher than the other, and &s;teepe&s;t toward the North &s;ide. The re&s;t of the I&s;land is indifferent level; where of late &s;ome rich Men have made Sugar Works; which formerly was all pa|&s;ture for Cattel: there are al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall Planta|tions of Potatoes and Yames, and they have &s;till a great many Cattel on the I&s;land; but it is not &s;o much e&s;teemed for its produce, as for its &s;ituation for the Trade with the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Formerly the Har|bour was never without Ships from <HI>Cart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">egne</HI> and <HI>Portobell,</HI> that did u&s;e to buy of the <HI>Dutch</HI> here 1000 or 1500 Negroes at once, be&s;ides great quantities of <HI>European</HI> Commodities; but of late that Trade is fallen into the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Jamaica:</HI> yet &s;till the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a va&s;t Trade over all the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> &s;ending from <HI>Holland</HI> Ships of good force laden

I was never at <HI>Aruba,</HI> therefore cannot &s;ay any thing of it as to my own knowledge; but by report it is much like <HI>Bon Airy,</HI> which I &s;hall de&s;cribe, only not &s;o big. Between <HI>Queri&s;ao</HI> and <HI>Bon Airy</HI> is a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Little Queri&s;ao,</HI> it is not above a league from <HI>Great Queri&s;ao.</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> has long had an eye on <HI>Queri&s;ao,</HI> and made &s;ome attempts to take it, but never yet &s;ucceeded. I have heard that about 23 or 24 years &s;ince the Governor had &s;old it to the <HI>French,</HI> but dyed a &s;mall time before the Fleet came to demand it; and by his death that de&s;ign failed. Afterwards, in the year 1678, the Count <HI>D' E&s;tree,</HI> who a year before had taken the I&s;le of <HI>Tobago</HI> from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> was &s;ent thither al&s;o with a Squadron of &s;tout Ships very well mann'd, and fitted with Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es; intending to take it by &s;torm.

The middle of the I&s;land is laid down in Lat. 12 d. 16 m. It is about 20 leagues from the Main, and 9 or 10 from <HI>Queri&s;ao,</HI> and is accounted 16 or 17 leagues round. The Road is on the S. W. &s;ide, near the middle of the I&s;land; where there is a pretty deep Bay runs in. Ships that come from the Ea&s;tward luff up clo&s;e to the Ea&s;tern &s;hoar; and let go their Anchor in 60 fathom water, within half a Cables length of the &s;hoar. But at the &s;ame time they mu&s;t be ready with a Boat to carry a Ha&s;ar or Rope, and make it fa&s;t a&s;hoar; otherwi&s;e, when the Land-wind comes in the night, the Ship would drive off to Sea again; for the ground is &s;o &s;teep, that no Anchor can hold if once it &s;tarts. About half a mile to the We&s;tward of this Anchoring place there is a &s;mall low land, and a Channel between it and the main I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es are about half a mile within Land, right again&s;t the Road: there is a Governor lives here, a Deputy to the Governor of <HI>Queri&s;ao,</HI> and 7 or 8 Soldiers, with 5 or 6 Families of <HI>Indians.</HI> There is no Fort; and the Soldiers in peaceable times have little to do but to eat and &s;leep, for they never watch, but in time of War. The <HI>Indians</HI> are Hus|bandmen, and plant Maiz and <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, and &s;ome Yams, and Potatoes: But their chiefe&s;t bu&s;i|ne&s;s is about Cattel; for this I&s;land is plentifully &s;tocked with Goats, and they &s;end great quantities every year in Salt to <HI>Queri&s;ao.</HI> There are &s;ome Hor&s;es, and Bulls and Cows; but I never &s;aw any Sheep, tho I have been all over the I&s;land. The South &s;ide is plain low Land, and there are &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, but none very large. There is a &s;mall
<PB N="49" REF="69">
Spring of Water by the Hou&s;es, which &s;erves the Inhabitants, tho it is blacki&s;h. At the We&s;t end of the I&s;land there is a good Spring of fre&s;h Water, and 3 and 4 <HI>Indian</HI> Families live there, but no Water nor Hou&s;es at any other place. On the South &s;ide, near the Ea&s;t end, is a good Salt-pond, where <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloops come for Salt.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bon-Airy</HI> we went to the I&s;le of <HI>Aves,</HI> or Birds; &s;o called from its great plenty of Birds, as <HI>Men-of-War</HI> and <HI>Boobies;</HI> but e&s;pecially <HI>Boobies.</HI> The <HI>Booby</HI> is a Water-fowl, &s;omewhat le&s;s than a Hen, of a light greyi&s;h colour. I ob&s;erved the <HI>Boobies</HI> of this I&s;land to be whiter than others. This Bird hath a &s;trong Bill, longer and bigger than a Crows, and broader at the end; her Feet are flat like a Ducks feet. It is a very &s;imple Creature, and will hardly go out of a Man's way. In other places they build their Ne&s;ts on the Ground, but here they build on Trees, which I never &s;aw any where el&s;e; tho' I have &s;een of them in a great many places. Their Fle&s;h is black and eats Fi&s;hy, but are often eaten by the Privateers. Their numbers have been much le&s;|&s;ened by the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, which was lo&s;t here, as I &s;hall give an account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Man-of-War</HI> (as it is called by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) is about the bigne&s;s of a Kite, and in &s;hape like it, but black; and the Neck is red. It lives on Fi&s;h, yet never lights on the Water, but &s;oars alo&s;t like a Kite, and when it &s;ees its prey, it flys down head fore|mo&s;t to the Waters edge, very &s;wiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as &s;wiftly; and never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his Feet are like other Land-fowl; and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are want|ing, on the Ground.</P>
<P>This I&s;land <HI>Aves</HI> lies about 8 or 9 leagues to the Ea&s;tward of the I&s;land <HI>Bon-Airy,</HI> about 14 or 15 leagues
<PB N="50" REF="70">
<MILESTONE N="1682" UNIT="year"> from the Main, and about the lat. of 11 d. 45 m. North. It is but &s;mall, not above 4 mile in length, and towards the Ea&s;t end not half a mile broad. On the North &s;ide it is low Land, commonly overflown with the Tide; but one the South &s;ide there is a great Rocky Bank of Coral thrown up by the Sea. The We&s;t end is, for near a mile &s;pace, plain even Savan|nah Land, without any Trees. There are 2 or 3 Wells dug by Privateers, who often frequent this I&s;land, becau&s;e there is a good Harbour about the middle of it on the North &s;ide, where they may conveniently careen. The Riff, or Bank of Rocks, on which the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was lo&s;t, as I mentioned above, runs along from the Ea&s;t end to the Northward about 3 mile, then trends away to the We&s;tward, making as it were, a Half-Moon. This Riff breaks off all the Sea, and there is good Riding in even &s;andy ground to the We&s;tward of it. There are 2 or 3 &s;mall low &s;andy-Keys, or I&s;land, within this Riff, about 3 miles from the Main I&s;land. The Count <HI>d'E&s;tree</HI> lo&s;t his Fleet here in this manner. Coming from the Ea&s;tward, he fell in on the back of the Riff, and fired Guns to give warning to the re&s;t of his Fleet: But they &s;uppo&s;ing their Admiral was engaged with Enemies, hoi&s;ted up their Top&s;ails, and croud|ed all the Sail they could make, and ran full &s;ail a&s;hoar after him; all within half a mile of each other. For his Light being in the Main-Top was an unhappy Beacon for them to follow; and there e&s;caped but one Kings-Ship and one Privateer. The Ships continued whole all day, and the Men had time enough, mo&s;t of them, to get a&s;hoar, yet ma|ny peri&s;hed in the Wreck: and many of tho&s;e that got &s;afe on the I&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, for want of being accu&s;tomed to &s;uch hard&s;hips, died like rotten Sheep. But the Privateers who had been u&s;ed to &s;uch accidents liv'd merrily, from whom I had this relation: and they told me, that if they had gone to <HI>Jamaica</HI> with 3<HI>cl.</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="71">
a Man in their Pockets, they could not have en|joyed them&s;elves more: For they kept in a Gang by them&s;elves, and watched when the Ships broke, to get the Goods that come from them; and though much was &s;taved again&s;t the Rocks, yet abundance of Wine and Brandy floated over the Riff, where the&s;e Privateers waited to take it up. They lived here about 3 weeks, waiting an opportunity to tran|&s;port them&s;elves back again into <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> in all which time, they were never without 2 or 3 Hog&s;|heads of Wine and Brandy in their Tents, and Bar|rels of Beef and Pork; which they could live on without Bread well enough, tho the new-comers out of <HI>France</HI> could not. There were about forty <HI>Frenchmen</HI> on board in one of the Ships where there was good &s;tore of Liquor, till the after part of her broke away, and floated over the Riff, and was carry'd away to Sea, with all the Men drinking and &s;inging, who being in drink, did not mind the danger, but were never heard of afterwards.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after this great Shipwrack, Cap|tain <HI>Pain,</HI> Commander of a Privateer of 6 Guns, had a plea&s;ant accident befel him at this I&s;land. He came hither to careen, intending to fit him&s;elf very well; for here lay driven on the I&s;land, Ma&s;t, Yards, Timbers, and many things that he wanted, therefore he haled into the Harbour, clo&s;e to the I&s;land, and unrigg'd his Ship. Before he had done, a Dutch Ship of 20 Guns, was &s;ent from <HI>Queri&s;ao</HI> to take up the Guns that were lo&s;t on the Riff: But &s;eeing a Ship in the Harbour, and knowing her to be a French Privateer, they thought to take her fir&s;t, and came within a mile of her, and began to fire at her, intending to warp in the next day, for it is very narrow going-in. Capt. <HI>Pain</HI> got a&s;hoar &s;ome of his Guns, and did what he could to re&s;i&s;t them; tho' he did in a manner conclude he mu&s;t be taken. But while his Men were thus bu&s;ied, he &s;py'd a
<PB N="52" REF="72">
<HI>Dutch</HI> Sloop turning to get into the Road, and &s;aw her at the evening Anchor at the We&s;t end of the I&s;land. This gave him &s;ome hope of making his e&s;cape; which he did, by &s;ending two Canoas in the night aboard the Sloop, who took her, and got confiderable purcha&s;e in her; and he went away in her, making a good Reprizal, and leaving his own empty Ship to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War.</P>
<P>There is another I&s;land to the Ea&s;tward of the I&s;le of <HI>Aves</HI> about 4 leagues, called by Privateers the little I&s;le of <HI>Aves,</HI> which is over-grown with Mangrove Trees. I have &s;een it, but was never on it. There are no Inhabitants, that I could learn, on either of the&s;e I&s;lands, but <HI>Boobies</HI> and a few other Birds.</P>
<P>While we were at the I&s;le of <HI>Aves,</HI> we careen'd Capt. <HI>Wright</HI>'s Bark, and &s;crubb'd the Sugar-prize, and got 2 Guns out of the Wrecks; continuing here till the beginning of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1681/2.</P>
<P>We went from hence to the I&s;les <HI>Roca</HI>'s, to careen the Sugar-prize, which the I&s;le of <HI>Aves</HI> was not a place &s;o convenient for. Accordingly we haled clo&s;e to one of the &s;mall I&s;lands, and got our Guns a&s;hoar the fir&s;t thing we did, and built a Brea&s;t-work on the Point, and planted all our Guns there, to hin|der an Enemy from coming to us while we lay on the Careen: Then we made a Hou&s;e, and cover'd ir with our Sails, to put our Goods and Provi&s;ions in. While we lay here, a <HI>French</HI> Man of War of 36 Guns, came thro' the Keys; or little I&s;lands; to whom we &s;old about 10 Tun of Sugar. I was a|board twice or thrice, and very kindly welcomed both by the Capt. and his Lieutenant, who was a Cavalier of <HI>Malta;</HI> and they both offered me great Encouragement in <HI>France,</HI> if I would go with them; but I ever de&s;igned to continue with tho&s;e of my own Nation.</P>
<P>The I&s;lands <HI>Roca</HI>'s are a parcel of &s;mall uninhabit|ed I&s;lands, lying about the lat. of 11 deg. 40 min.
<PB N="53" REF="73">
about 15 or 16 leagues from the Main, and about 20 leagues N. W. by W. from <HI>Tortuga,</HI> and 6 or 7 leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Orchilla,</HI> another I&s;land lying about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Main; which I&s;land I have &s;een, but was never at it. <HI>Roca</HI>'s &s;tretch them&s;elves Ea&s;t and We&s;t about 5 leagues, and their breadth about 3 leagues. The Norther|mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands is the mo&s;t remarkable by rea|&s;on of a high white rocky Hill at the we&s;t end of it, which may be &s;een a great way; and on it there are abundance of Tropick Birds, Men-of-War, Boo|by and Noddys, which breed there. The Booby and Man-of-War, I have de&s;cribed already. The Noddy is a &s;mall black Bird, about the bigne&s;s of the En|gli&s;h Black-bird, and indifferent good Meat. They build in Rocks. We never find them far off from &s;hoar. I have &s;een of them in other places, but never &s;aw any of their Ne&s;ts, but in this I&s;land, where there is great plenty of them. The Tropick Bird is as big as a Pidgeon, but round and plump like a Partridge. They are all white, except two or three Feathers in each Wing of a light grey. Their Bills are of a yellowi&s;h colour, thick and &s;hort. They have one long Feather, or rather a Quill, about 7 inches long, grows at the Rump, which is all the Tail they have. They are never &s;een far without either Tro|pick, for which rea&s;on they are called Tropick Birds. They are very good food, and we meet with them a great way at Sea, and I never &s;aw of them any where but at Sea, and in this I&s;land, where they build, and are found in great plenty.</P>
<P>By the Sea, on the South &s;ide of that high Hill, there's fre&s;h Water comes out of the Rocks, but &s;o &s;lowly, that it yields not above 40 Gallons in 24 hours, and it ta&s;tes &s;o copperi&s;h, or aluminous ra|ther, and rough in the Mouth, that it &s;eems very unplea&s;ant at fir&s;t drinking: But after 2 or 3 days any Water will &s;eem to have no ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="74">
The middle of this I&s;land low plain Land, over grown with long Gra&s;s, where there are multitudes of &s;mall grey Fowls no bigger than a Black Bird, yet lay Eggs bigger than a Magpy's; and they are therefore by Privateers called Egg Birds. The Ea&s;t end of the I&s;land is overgrown with black Mangrove Trees.</P>
<P>There are 3 &s;orts of Mangrove Trees, black, red and white. The black Mangrove is the large&s;t Tree; the body about as big as an Oak, and about 20 foot high. It is very hard and &s;erviceable Timber, but extraordinary heavy, therefore not much made u&s;e of for Building. The red Mangrove groweth commonly by the Sea &s;ide, or by Rivers or Creeks. The Body is not &s;o big as that of the black Man|grove, but always grows out of many Roots about the bigne&s;s of a Mans Leg, &s;ome bigger, &s;ome le&s;s, which is about 6, 8, or 10 foot above the Ground, joyn into one trunk or body, that &s;eems to be &s;up|ported by &s;o many Artificial Stakes. Where this &s;ort of Tree grows, it is impo&s;&s;ible to march, by rea&s;on of the&s;e Stakes, which grow &s;o mixt one among&s;t another, that I have, when forced to go thro' them gone half a mile, and never &s;et my foot on the Ground, &s;tepping from Root to Root. The Timber is hard and good for many u&s;es. The in&s;ide of the Bark is red, and it is u&s;ed for tanning of Lea|ther very much all over the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> The white Mangrove never groweth &s;o big as the other two &s;orts, neither is it of any great u&s;e: Of the young Trees Privateers u&s;e to make Loom, or Handles for their Oars, for it is commonly &s;traight, but not very &s;trong, which is the fault of them. Neither the black nor white Mangrove grow towering up from &s;tilts or ri&s;ing root, as the red doth; but the Body immediately out of the Ground, like other Trees.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="75">
The Land of this Ea&s;t end is light &s;and, which is &s;ometimes over-flown with the Sea at Spring-tides. The Road for Ships is on the South &s;ide, again&s;t the middle of the I&s;land. The re&s;t of the I&s;lands of <HI>Roca</HI>'s are low. The next to this on the South &s;ide is but &s;mall, flat, and even, without Trees, bearing only Gra&s;s. On the South &s;ide of it is a Pond of bracki&s;h water, which &s;ometimes Privateers u&s;e in|&s;tead of better; there is likewi&s;e good Riding by it About a league from this are two other I&s;lands, not 200 yards di&s;tant from each other; yet a deep Channel for Ships to pa&s;s through. They are both overgrown with red Mangrove Trees; which Trees, above any of the Mangroves, do flouri&s;h be&s;t in wet drowned Land, &s;uch as the&s;e two I&s;lands are; only the Ea&s;t point of the We&s;termo&s;t I&s;land is dry &s;and, without Tree or Bu&s;h. On thispoint we careened, lying on the South &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>The other I&s;lands are low, and have red Man|groves, and other Trees on them. Here al&s;o Ships may ride, but no &s;uch place for careening as where we lay, becau&s;e at that place Ships may hale clo&s;e to the &s;hoar; and if they had but four Guns on the point, may &s;ecure the Channel, and hinder any Enemy from coming near them. I ob&s;erve, that within a|mong the I&s;lands, was good riding in many places, but not without the I&s;lands, except to the We&s;t|ward, or South We&s;t of them. For on the Ea&s;t, or N. E. of the&s;e I&s;lands, the common Trade Wind blows, and makes a great Sea: and to the South|ward of them, there is no ground under 70, 80, or 100 fathom, clo&s;e by the Land.</P>
<P>After we had filled what water we could from hence, we &s;et out again in <HI>April</HI> 1682. and came to <HI>Salt-Tortuga,</HI> &s;o called to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the &s;hoals of <HI>Dry Tortugas,</HI> near Capt <HI>Florida,</HI> and from the I&s;le of <HI>Tortugas</HI> by <HI>Hi&s;pamola,</HI> which was called formerly <HI>French Tortugas;</HI> though not having heard
<PB N="56" REF="76">
any mention of that name a great while, I am apt to think it is &s;wallowed up in that of <HI>Petit-Guavres,</HI> the chief Garri&s;on the French have in tho&s;e parts. This I&s;land we arrived at is pretty large, uninhabit|ed, and abounds with Salt. It is in lat. 11 d. North, and lyeth We&s;t and a little Northerly from <HI>Marga|rita,</HI> an I&s;land inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;trong, and wealthy; it is di&s;tant from it about 14 leagues, and 17 or 18 from Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> on the Main: A Ship being within the&s;e I&s;lands, a little to the South ward, may &s;ee at once the Main, <HI>Margarita,</HI> and <HI>Tortuga,</HI> when it is clear weather. The Ea&s;t end of <HI>Tortuga</HI> is full of rugged, bare, broken Rocks, which &s;tretch them&s;elves a little way out to Sea. At the S. E. part is of an indifferent good Road for Ships, much frequented in peaceable times by Merchant|&s;hips, that come thither to lade Salt, in the months of <HI>May, June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> For at the Ea&s;t end is a large Salt-pond, within 200 paces of the Sea. The Salt begins to kern or grain in <HI>April,</HI> except it is a dry &s;ea&s;on; for it is ob&s;erved that Rain makes the Salt kern. I have &s;een above 20 Sail at a time in this Road come to lade Salt; and the&s;e Ships coming from &s;ome of the <HI>Caribbe I&s;lands,</HI> are always well &s;tored with Rum, Sugar and Lime-juice to make Punch, to hearten their Men when they are at work, getting and bringing aboard the Salt; and they commonly provide the more, in hopes to meet with Privateers, who re&s;ort hither in the afore|&s;aid Months, purpo&s;ely to keep a <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> as they call it; being &s;ure to meet with Liquor enough to be merry with, and are very Liberal to tho&s;e that treat them. Near the We&s;t end of the I&s;land, on the South &s;ide, there is a &s;mall Harbour and &s;ome fre&s;h Water: That end of the I&s;land is full of &s;hrub|by Trees, but the Ea&s;t end is rocky and barren as to Trees, producing only cour&s;e Gra&s;s. There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">me Goats on it, but not many, and Turtle or

Tortoi&s;e come upon the &s;andy Bays to lay their Eggs, and from them the I&s;land hath its name. There is no riding any where but in the Roads where the Salt-ponds are, or in the Harbour.</P>
<P>At this I&s;le we thought to have &s;old our Sugar a|mong the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships that come hither for Salt; but failing there, we de&s;ign'd for <HI>Trinidada,</HI> an I&s;land near the main, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tolerably &s;trong and wealthy: but the Current and Ea&s;terly winds hindring us, we pa&s;&s;ed through between <HI>Margarita</HI> and the main, and went to <HI>Blanco,</HI> a pret|ty large I&s;land almo&s;t North of <HI>Margarita;</HI> about 30 leagues from the main, and in 11 d. 50 m. North Lat. It is a flat, even, low, uninhabited I&s;land, dry and healthy: mo&s;t Savannah of long Gra&s;s, and hath &s;ome Trees of <HI>Lignum Vitae</HI> growing in Spots, with &s;hrubby bu&s;hes of other Wood about them. It is plentifully &s;tored with <HI>Guano's</HI> which are an Animal like a Lizard, but much bigger. The body is as big as the &s;mall of a mans Leg, and from the hind quarter the Tail grows tapering to the end which is very &s;mall. If a man takes hold of the Tail, except very near the hind quarter, it will part and break off in one of the joints, and the <HI>Guano</HI> will get away. They lay Eggs as mo&s;t of tho&s;e amphi|bious creatures do, and are very good to eat. Their fle&s;h is much e&s;teem'd by Privateers, who commonly dre&s;s them for their &s;ick men; for they make very good Broath. They are of divers colours, as almo&s;t black, dark brown, light brown, dark green, light green, yellow and &s;peckled. They all live as well in the Water as on Land, and &s;ome of them are con&s;tantly in the Water and among Rocks: The&s;e are commonly black. Others that live in &s;wampy wet ground are commonly on Bu&s;hes and Trees, the&s;e are green. But &s;uch as live in dry ground, as here at <HI>Blanco</HI> are commonly yellow; yet the&s;e al|&s;o will live in the Water, and are &s;ometimes on

Trees. The Road is on the N. W. end, again&s;t a &s;mall Cove, or little &s;andy Bay. There is no ri|ding any where el&s;e, for it is deep water, and &s;teep, clo&s;e to the Land. There is one &s;mall Spring on the We&s;t &s;ide, and there are &s;andy Bays round the I&s;land, where Turtle or Tortoi&s;e, come up in great abundance, going a&s;hoar in the night. The&s;e that frequent this I&s;land are called green Turtle, and they are the be&s;t of that &s;ort, both for largne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of any in all the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> I would here give a particular de&s;cription of the&s;e, and other &s;orts of Turtle in the&s;e Seas; but becau&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome other &s;ort of Turtle when I come again into the South Seas, that are very different from all the&s;e, I &s;hall there give a general account of all the&s;e &s;everal &s;orts at once, that the difference between them may be the better di&s;cern|ed. Some of our modern De&s;criptions &s;peak of Goats on this I&s;land. I know not what there may have been formerly, but there are none now to my certain knowledge; for my &s;elf, and many more of our Crew, have been all over it. Indeed the&s;e parts have undergone great changes in this la&s;t Age, as well in places them&s;elves, as in their Owners, and Commodities of them; particularly <HI>Nombre deDios,</HI> a City once famous, and which &s;till retains a con&s;i|derable name in &s;ome late accounts, is now nothing but a Name. For I have lain a&s;hoar in the place where that City &s;tood; but it is all over-grown with Wood, &s;o as to leave no &s;ign that any Town hath been there.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at the I&s;le of <HI>Blanco</HI> not above ten days, and then went back to <HI>Salt-Tortuga</HI> again, where Captain <HI>Yanky</HI> parted with us: And from thence, after about 4 days, all which time our men were drunk and quarrelling, we in Capt. <HI>Wright</HI>'s Ship went to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos</HI> on the Main Land. This Coa&s;t is upon &s;everal accounts very remarka|ble:
<PB N="59" REF="79">
'Tis a continued tract of high Ridges of Hills, and &s;mall Valleys intermixt for about 20 leagues, &s;tretching Ea&s;t and We&s;t, but in &s;uch manner, that the Ridges of Hills and the Valleys alternately run pointing upon the &s;hore from South to North: The Valleys &s;ome of them about 4 or 5, others not above one or two furlongs wide, and in length from the Sea &s;carce any of them above 4 or 5 mile at mo&s;t; there being a long ridge of Mountains at that di|&s;tance from the Sea-coa&s;t, and in a manner parallel to it that joyns tho&s;e &s;horter Ridges, and clo&s;eth up the South end of the Valleys, which at the North ends of them lye open to the Sea, and make &s;o many little &s;andy Bays, that are the only landing places on the Coa&s;t. Both the main Ridge and the&s;e &s;horter Ribs are very high Land, &s;o that 3 or 4 leagues off at Sea the Valleys &s;carce appear to the Eye, but all looks like one great Mountain. From the I&s;les of <HI>Roca</HI>'s about 15, and from the I&s;le of <HI>Aves</HI> about 20 leagues off, we &s;ee this Coa&s;t very plain from on board our Ships, yet when at Anchor on this Coa&s;t, we cannot &s;ee tho&s;e I&s;les; tho again from the tops of the&s;e Hills, they appear as if at no great di&s;tance, like &s;o many Hillocks in a Pond. The&s;e Hills are barren, except the lower &s;ides of them that are covered with &s;ome of the &s;ame rich black Mould that fiills the Valleys, and is as good as I have &s;een. In &s;ome of the Valleys there's a &s;trong red Clay, but in the general they are extreamly fertile, well water'd, and inhabited by <HI>Spaniards</HI> and their Negroes. They have Maiz and Plantains for their &s;upport, with <HI>Indian</HI> Fowls and &s;ome Hogs. But the main product of the&s;e Valleys, and indeed the only Commodity it vends, are the Cacao Nuts, of which the Chocolate is made. The Cacao-Tree grows no where in the North Seas but in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> on <HI>Co&s;ta Rica,</HI> between <HI>Portabel</HI> and <HI>Nica|ragua,</HI> chiefly up <HI>Carpenters</HI> River; and on this Coa&s;t

as high as the I&s;le of <HI>Trinidada.</HI> In the South Seas, it grows in the River of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> a little to the Southward of the Line, and in the Valley of <HI>Collima,</HI> on the South &s;ide of the Continent of <HI>Mexico;</HI> both which places I &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I am confident there's no place in the World where the Cacao grows, except tho&s;e in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> of which there are now but few remaining, of many and large Walks or Plantations of them found there by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at their fir&s;t arrival, and &s;ince planted by them; and even the&s;e, tho there is a great deal of pains and care be&s;towed on them, yet &s;eldom come to any thing being generally blighted. The Nuts of this Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos,</HI> tho le&s;s than tho&s;e of <HI>Co&s;ta Rica</HI> which are large flat Nuts, yet are bet|ter and fatter in my opinion, being &s;o very oily, that we are forced to u&s;e Water in rubbing them up; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that live here, in&s;tead of parching them, to get off the Shell before they pound or rub them to make Chocalate, do in a manner burn 'em to dry up the Oil; for el&s;e they &s;ay, it would fill them too full of blood, drinking Chocolate as they do five or &s;ix times a day. My worthy Con|&s;ort Mr <HI>Ringro&s;e</HI> commends mo&s;t the <HI>Guiaquil</HI> Nut; I pre&s;ume, becau&s;e he had little knowledge of the re&s;t, for being intimately acquainted with him, I know the cour&s;e of his Travels and Experience: But I am per&s;waded, had he known the re&s;t &s;o well as I pretend to have done, who have at &s;everal times been long u&s;ed to, and in a manner lived upon all the &s;everal &s;orts of 'em above-mentioned, he would prefer the <HI>Caraccos</HI> Nuts before any other; yet po&s;|&s;ibly the drying up of the&s;e Nuts &s;o much by the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> here, as I &s;aid, may le&s;&s;en their e&s;teem with tho&s;e <HI>Europeans,</HI> that u&s;e their Chocolate ready rubb'd up: So that we always cho&s;e to make it up our &s;elves.</P>

The Cacao Tree hath a Body about a foot and an half thick (the large&s;t &s;ort) and 7 or 8 foot high to the Branches, which are large, and &s;preading like an Oak, with a pretty thick, &s;mooth, dark-green leaf, &s;haped like that of a Plumb-Tree, but larger. The Nuts are inclo&s;ed in Cods as big as both a Man's Fi&s;ts put together: At the broad end of which there is a &s;mall, tough, limber &s;talk, by which they hang pendulous from the Body of the Tree, in all parts of it from top to bottom, &s;cattered at irregular di&s;tances, and from the greater branches a little way up, e&s;pecially at the joints of them, or partings, where they hang thicke&s;t, but never on the &s;maller boughs: there may be ordinarily about 20 or 30 of the&s;e Cods upon a well bearing Tree; and they have 2 Crops of them in a year, one in <HI>December,</HI> but the be&s;t in <HI>June.</HI> The Cod it &s;elf or Shell is almo&s;t half an Inch thick; neither &s;pongy nor woody, but of a &s;ub&s;tance between both, brittle, yet harder than the Rind of a Lemmon; like which its &s;urface is grained or knobb'd, but more cour&s;e and unequal: the Cods at fir&s;t are of a dark-green, but the &s;ide of them next the Sun of a muddy red. As they grow ripe, the green turns to a fine bright yellow, and the muddy to a more lively beautiful red, very plea&s;ant to the Eye. They neither ripen, nor are gathered at once: but for three weeks or a month when the Sea&s;on is, the Over&s;eers of the Plantations go every day about to &s;ee which are turned yellow; cutting at once it may be, not a|bove one from a Tree. The Cods thus gathered, they lay in &s;everal heaps to &s;weat, and then bur&s;ting the Shell with their hands, they pull out the Nuts, which are the only &s;ub&s;tance they contain, having no &s;talk or pith among them, and (excepting that the&s;e Nuts lye in regular rows) are placed like the grains of Maiz, but &s;ticking together, and &s;o clo&s;e|ly &s;towed, that after they have been once &s;eparated,

it would be hard to place them again in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s. There are generally near 100 Nuts in a Cod; in proportion to the greatne&s;s of which, for it varies, the Nuts are bigger or le&s;s. When taken out they dry them in the Sun upon Mats &s;pread of the Ground; after which they need no more care, having a thin hard skin of their own, and much Oil which pre&s;erves them. Salt water will not hurt them; for we had our Baggs rotten, lying in the bottom of our Ship, and yet the Nuts never the wor&s;e. They rai&s;e the young Trees of Nuts, &s;et with the great end down-ward in fine black Mould, and in the &s;ame places where they are to bear; which they do in 4 or 5 years time, without the trouble of tran&s;planting. There are ordinarily of the&s;e Trees, from 500 to 2000 and upward in a Plantation or Cacao walk, as they call them; and they &s;helter the young Trees from the Weather with Plantains &s;et about them for 2 or 3 years; de|&s;troying all the Pantains by &s;uch time the Cacao-Trees are of a pretty good Body, and able to endure the heat; which I take to be the mo&s;t pernicious to them of any thing; for tho the&s;e Valleys lye open to the North Winds, unle&s;s a little &s;heltered here and there, by &s;ome Groves of Plantain Trees, which are purpo&s;ely &s;et near the Shores of the &s;everal Bays yet by all that I could either ob&s;erve or learn, the Cacaos in this Country are never blighted, as I have often known them to be in other places.

Not far from that place is <HI>Verina,</HI> a &s;mall Village and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantation, famous for its Tobacco; reputed the be&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Caraccos,</HI> all this Coa&s;t is &s;ubject to dry Winds, generally North Ea&s;t, which caus'd us to have &s;cabby Lips; and we always &s;ound it thus, and that in different Sea&s;ons of the year, for I have been on this Coa&s;t &s;everal times. In other re&s;pects it is very healthy, and a &s;weet clear Air. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> have Look-outs or Scouts on the Hills, and Brea&s;t-works in the Valleys, and mo&s;t of
<PB N="64" REF="84">
their Negroes are furni&s;hed with Arms al&s;o for de|fence of the Bays. The Dutch have a very profita|ble Trade here almo&s;t to them&s;elves. I have known three or four great Ships at a time on the Coa&s;t, each it may be of 30 or 40 Guns. They carry hi|ther all &s;orts of <HI>European</HI> Commodities, e&s;pecially Linnen, making va&s;t returns, chiefly in Silver and Cacao. And I have often wondred and regretted it, that none of my own Countrymen find the way thither directly from <HI>England;</HI> for our <HI>Jamaica-men</HI> trade thither indeed, and find the &s;weet of it, tho they carry <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commodities at &s;econd or third hand.</P>
<P>While we lay on this Coa&s;t, we went a&s;hore in &s;ome of the Bays, and took 7 or 8 Tun of Cacao; and after that 3 Barks, one laden with Hides, the &s;econd with <HI>European</HI> Commodities, the third with Earthen ware and Brandy. With the&s;e 3 Barks we went again to the I&s;land <HI>Roca</HI>'s where we &s;hared our Commodities and &s;eparated, having Ve&s;&s;els enough to tran&s;port us all whither we thought mo&s;t convenient. Twenty of us (for we were about 60) took one of the Ve&s;&s;els and our &s;hare of the Goods, and went directly for <HI>Virginia.</HI> In our way thither we took &s;everal of the Sucking fi&s;hes; for when we &s;ee them about the Ship, we ca&s;t out a Line and Hook, and they will take it with any manner of Bait, whether Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h: the Suck+ing fi&s;h is about the bigne&s;s of a large Whiting, and much of the &s;ome &s;hape toward the Tayl, but the Head is flatter. From the head to the middle of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> back, there groweth a &s;ort of fle&s;h of a hard gri&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ub&s;tance, like that of the <HI>Limpit</HI> (a Shellfi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tapering up piramidically) which &s;ticks to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rocks; or like the head or mouth of a Shell Snai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> but harder.

ridges, with which it will fa&s;ten it &s;elf to any thing that it meets with in the Sea, ju&s;t as a Snail doth to a Wall. When any of them happen to come about a Ship they &s;eldom leave her, for they will feed on &s;uch filth as is daily thrown over-board, or on meer Excrements. When it is fair weather, and but little wind, they will play about the Ship; but in blu&s;t|ering weather, or when the Ship &s;ails quick, they commonly fa&s;ten them&s;elves to the Ships bottom, from whence neither the Ships motion, tho ne|ver &s;o &s;wift, nor the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous Sea can re|move them. They will likewi&s;e fa&s;ten them&s;elves to any other bigger Fi&s;h; for they never &s;wim fa&s;t them&s;elves, if they meet with any thing to carry them. I have found them &s;ticking to a Shark, after it was hal'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the Deck, though a Shark is &s;o &s;trong and boi&s;terous a Fi&s;h, and throws about him &s;o vehemently for half an hour together, it may be, when caught, that did not the Sucking-fi&s;h &s;tick at no ordinary rate, it mu&s;t needs be ca&s;t off by &s;o much violence. It is u&s;ual al&s;o to &s;ee them &s;ticking to Tur|tle, to any old Trees, Planks or the like, that lie driving at Sea. Any knobs or inequalities at a Ships bottom, are a great hindrance to the &s;wiftne&s;s of its &s;ailing; and 10 or 12 of the&s;e &s;ticking to it, mu&s;t needs retard it as much in a manner, as if its bottom were foul. So that I am inclined to think that this Fi&s;h is the <HI>Remora,</HI> of which the Ancients tell &s;uch &s;tories; if it be not, I know no other that is, and I leave the Reader to judge. I have &s;een of the&s;e Suck|ing fi&s;hes in great plenty in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and in all the Sea between that and the Coa&s;t of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ces,</HI> as about tho&s;e I&s;lands particularly. I have lately de&s;crib'd, <HI>Rocas, Blanco, Tortugas,</HI> &amp;c. they have no &s;cales, and are very good meat.</P>

Among tho&s;e who
<PB N="68" REF="88">
<MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="year"> accompanied Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> into the South Seas in our former Expedition, and leaving him there, re|turned over Land, as is &s;aid in the Introduction, and in the 1&s;t and 2d Chapters; there was one Mr <HI>Cook,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Native of St <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> a <HI>Cirole,</HI> as we call all born of <HI>European</HI> Parents in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> He was a &s;en&s;ible man, and had been &s;ome years a Privateer. At our joining our &s;elves with tho&s;e Privateers we met at our coming again to the North Seas, his lot was to be with Captain <HI>Yanky,</HI> who kept company for &s;ome con&s;iderable time with Capt. <HI>Wright,</HI> in who&s;e Ship I was, and part|ed with us at our 2d Anchoring at the I&s;le of <HI>Tor|tugas,</HI> as I have &s;aid in the la&s;t Chapter. After our parting, this Mr <HI>Cook</HI> being Quarterma&s;ter un|der Captain <HI>Yanky,</HI> the &s;econd place in the Ship, according to the Law of Privateers, laid claim to a Ship they took from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and &s;uch of Captain <HI>Yanky</HI>'s men as were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, particu|larly all tho&s;e who came with us over Land, went aboard this Prize Ship under the new Capt <HI>Cook.</HI> This de&s;tribution was made at the I&s;le of <HI>Vacca,</HI> or the I&s;le of <HI>A&s;h,</HI> as we call it; and here they parted al&s;o &s;uch Goods as they had taken. But Capt. <HI>Cook</HI> having no Commi&s;&s;ion, as Captain <HI>Yanky,</HI> Captain <HI>Tri&s;tian,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>French</HI> Commanders had, who lay then at that I&s;land, and they grutching the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, they all joined together, plun|dered the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of their Ship, Goods and Arms, and turned them a&s;hore. Yet Capt. <HI>Tri&s;tian</HI> took in about 8 or 10 of the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and carried them with him to <HI>Petit Guavers:</HI> of which number Cap|tain <HI>Cook</HI> was one, and Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> another, who with the re&s;t found means to &s;eize the Ship as &s;he lay at anchor in the Road, Capt. <HI>Tri&s;tian</HI> and many of his men being then a&s;hore: and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ending a&s;hore &s;uch <HI>French</HI> men as remained in the Ship and were ma&s;tered by them, tho' &s;uperior in number,
<PB N="69" REF="89">
&s;tood away with her immediately for the I&s;le of <HI>Vac|ca,</HI> before any notice of this &s;urprize could reach the <HI>French</HI> Governor of that I&s;le; &s;o deceiving him al&s;o by a Stratagem, they got on board the re&s;t of their Countrymen, wha had been left on that I&s;land; and going thence they took a Ship newly come from <HI>France,</HI> laden with Wines. They al&s;o took a Ship of good force, in which they re&s;olved to em|bark them&s;elves, and make a new Expedition into the South Seas, to crui&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> But fir&s;t they went for <HI>Virginia</HI> with their Prizes; where they arrived the <HI>April</HI> after my co|ming thither. The be&s;t of the Prizes carried 18 Guns: this they fitted up there with Sails, and eve|ry thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o long a Voyage; &s;elling the Wines they had taken for &s;uch Provi&s;ions as they wanted. My &s;elf and tho&s;e of our Fellow-travellers over the I&s;thmus of <HI>America,</HI> who came with me to <HI>Virginia</HI> the year before this, (mo&s;t of which had &s;ince made a &s;hort Voyage to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and again returned to <HI>Virginia</HI>) re&s;olved to joyn our &s;elves to the&s;e new Adventurers, and as many more engaged tn the &s;ame de&s;ign as made our whole Crew con&s;i&s;t of 70 men. So having furni&s;hed our &s;elves with nece&s;&s;ary Materials, and agreed upon &s;ome particular Rules, e&s;pecially of Temperance and So|briety, by rea&s;on of the length of our intended Voy|age, we all went on board our Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 23. 1683. We &s;ailed from <HI>Achamack</HI> to <HI>Virginia,</HI> under the command of Capt. <HI>Cook,</HI> bound for the South Seas. I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with an account of every days run, but ha&s;ten to the le&s;s known parts of the World, to give a de|&s;cription of 'em; only relating &s;uch memorable Accidents as happened to us, and &s;uch places as we touched at by the way.</P>
<P>We met nothing worth ob&s;ervation till we came to the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> except a terrible Storm,
<PB N="70" REF="90">
which could not e&s;cape it: This happen'd in a few days after we left <HI>Virginia,</HI> with a S. S. E. wind ju&s;t in our Teeth. The &s;torm la&s;ted above a week: it drencht us all like &s;o many drowned Rats, and was one of the wor&s;t &s;torms I ever was in. One I met with in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> was more violent for the time, but of not above 24 hours continuance. Af|ter that &s;torm we had favourable winds and good weather, and in &s;hort time we arrived at the I&s;land <HI>Sall,</HI> which is one of the Ea&s;termo&s;t of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands. Of the&s;e there are ten in number (&s;o con|&s;iderable as to bear di&s;tinct names) and they lie &s;e|veral degrees off from <HI>Cape Verd</HI> in <HI>Africk</HI> whence they receive that Appellation; taking up about 5 deg. of Longitude in breadth, and about as many of Latitude in their length, <HI>viz.</HI> from near 14 to 19 North. They are mo&s;t inhabited by <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Banditti. This of <HI>Sall</HI> is an I&s;land lying in the Lat. of 16 in Long. 19 deg. 33 m. We&s;t from the <HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> &s;tretching from North to South about 8 or 9 leagues, and not above a league and an half or 2 leagues wide. It hath its name from the abun|dance of Salt that is naturally congealed there, the whole I&s;land being full of large Salt-ponds. The Land is very barren, producing no Tree that I could &s;ee, but &s;ome &s;mall &s;hrubby Bu&s;hes by the Sea &s;ide Neither could I di&s;cern any Gra&s;s, yet there are &s;ome poor Goats on it.</P>
<P>I know not whether there are any other Bea&s;ts on the I&s;land: There are &s;ome wild Fowl, but I judge not many. I &s;aw a few Flamingos, which is a &s;ort of large Fowl, much like a Heron in &s;hape but bigger, and of a reddi&s;h colour. They delight to keep together in great companies, and feed in Mud or Ponds, or in &s;uch places where there is not much Water: They are very &s;hy, therefore it is hard to &s;hoot them. Yet I have lain ob&s;cured in the evening near a place where they re&s;ort, and
<PB N="71" REF="91">
with two more in my company have killed 14 of them at once; the fir&s;t &s;hot being made while they were &s;tanding on the ground, the other two as they ro&s;e. They build their Ne&s;ts in &s;hallow Ponds, where there is much Mud, which they &s;crape toge|ther, making little Hillocks, like &s;mall I&s;lands, ap|pearing out of the Water, a foot and half high from the bottom. They make the foundation of the&s;e Hillocks broad, bringing them up tapering to the top, where they leave a &s;mall hollow pit to lay their Eggs in; and when they either lay their Eggs, or hatch them, they &s;tand all the while, not on the Hillock, but clo&s;e by it with their Legs on the ground and in the water, re&s;ting them&s;elves again&s;t the Hillock, and covering the hollow Ne&s;t upon it with their Rumps: For their Legs are very long; and building thus, as they do, upon the ground they could neither draw their Legs conveniently in|to their Ne&s;ts, nor &s;it down upon them otherwi&s;e than by re&s;ting their whole bodies there, to the pre|judice of their Eggs or their young, were it not for this admirable contrivance, which they have by na|tural in&s;tinct. They never lay more than two Eggs, and &s;eldom fewer. They young ones cannot fly till they are almo&s;t full grown; but will run prodigi|ou&s;ly fa&s;t; yet we have taken many of them. The Fle&s;h of both young and old is lean and black, yet very good meat, ta&s;ting neither fi&s;hy, nor any way un&s;avory. Their Tongues are large, having a large knob of fat at the root, which is an excellent bit: a Di&s;h of <HI>Flamingo</HI>'s Tongues being fit for a Princes Table.</P>
<P>When many of them are &s;tanding together by a Ponds &s;ide, being half a mile di&s;tant from a Man, they appear to him like a Brick Wall; their Feathers being of the colour of new red Brick: and they commonly &s;tand upright, and &s;ingle, one by one, exactly in a row (except when feeding) and clo&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="92">
by each other. The young ones at fir&s;t are of a light grey; and as their Wing-feathers &s;pring out, they grow darker; and never come to their right colour, or any beautiful &s;hape, under 10 or 11 months old. I have &s;een <HI>Flamingos</HI> at <HI>Rio la Hacha,</HI> and at an I&s;land lying near the Main of <HI>America,</HI> right again&s;t <HI>Queri&s;ao,</HI> called by Privateers <HI>Flamingo</HI> Key, from the multitude of the&s;e Fowls that breed there: and I never &s;aw of their Ne&s;ts and young but here.</P>
<P>There are not above 5 or 6 Men on this I&s;land of <HI>Sall,</HI> and a poor Governor, as they called him, who came on board in our Boat, and brought 3 or 4 poor lean Goats for a Pre&s;ent to our Captain, tel|ling him they were the be&s;t that the I&s;land did afford. The Captain, minding more the poverty of the Giver than the value of the Pre&s;ent, gave him in requital a Coat to cloath him; for he had no|thing but a few Rags on his back, and an old Hat not worth 3 farthings; which yet I believe he wore but &s;eldom, for fear he &s;hould want before he might get another; for he told us there had not been a Ship in 3 years before. We bought of him about 20 bu&s;hels of Salt for a few old Cloaths: and he begg'd a little Powder and Shot. We &s;tay'd here 3 days; in which time one of the&s;e <HI>Partugue&s;e</HI> offered to &s;ome of our Men a lump of Ambergrie&s;e in ex|change for &s;ome Cloaths, de&s;iring them to keep it &s;ecret, for he &s;aid if the Governor &s;hould know it, he &s;hould be hang'd. At length one Mr <HI>Coppinger</HI> bought it for a &s;mall matter; yet I believe he gave more than it was worth. We had not a Man in the Ship that knew Ambergrie&s;e; but I have &s;ince &s;een it in other places, and therefore am certain it was not right. It was of a dark colour, like Sheeps Dung, and very &s;oft, but of no &s;mell, and po&s;&s;ibly 'twas &s;ome of their Goats Dung. I afterwards &s;aw &s;ome &s;old at the <HI>Nequebars</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> which was of
<PB N="73" REF="93">
a light colour, but very hard, neither had it any &s;mell; and this al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, was a cheat. Yet it is certain that in both the&s;e places there is Am|bergrie&s;e found.</P>
<P>I was told by one <HI>John Read,</HI> a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Man, that he was Prentice to a Ma&s;ter who traded to the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> and once as he was riding at an Anchor at <HI>Fogo,</HI> another of the&s;e I&s;lands, there was a lump of it &s;wam by the Ship, and the Boat being a&s;hoar he mi&s;t it; but knew it to be Amber|grie&s;e, having taken up a lump &s;wimming in the like manner the Voyage before, and his Ma&s;ter ha|ving at &s;everal times bought pieces of it of the Na|tives of the I&s;le of <HI>Fogo,</HI> &s;o as to enrich him&s;elf thereby. And &s;o at the <HI>Necquebars, Engli&s;h</HI> men have bought, as I have been credibly informed, great quantities of very good Ambergrie&s;e. Yet the Inha|bitants are &s;o &s;ubtil that they will counterfeit it, both there and here: and I have heard that in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> whence much of it comes, the Native <HI>Indians</HI> there u&s;e the &s;ame Fraud.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, I cannot omit to tell my Reader what I learnt from Mr <HI>Hill,</HI> a Chyrurgeon, upon his &s;hewing me once a piece of Ambergrie&s;e, which was thus. One Mr <HI>Benjamin Berker,</HI> a Man that I have been long well acquainted with, and know him to be a very diligent and ob&s;erving Per|&s;on, and likewi&s;e very &s;ober and credible, told this Mr <HI>Hill,</HI> that being in the Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> to pro|cure Logwood, which grows there in great abun|dance, and pa&s;&s;ing in a Canoa over to one of the I&s;lands in that Bay, he found upon the &s;hoar, on a &s;andy Bay there, a lump of Ambergrie&s;e, &s;o large, that when carried to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> he found it to weigh one hundred pound and upwards. When he fir&s;t found it, it lay dry, above the mark which the Sea then came to at high-water; and he ob&s;erved in it a great multitude of Beetles: It was of a dusky co|lour,
<PB N="74" REF="94">
towards black, and about the hardne&s;s of mel|low Chee&s;e, and of a very fragrant &s;mell: This that Mr <HI>Hill</HI> &s;hewed me, being &s;ome of it, which Mr <HI>Barker</HI> gave him. Be&s;ides tho&s;e already mention'd, all the places where I have heard that Ambergrie&s;e hath been found, at <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> and that part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk,</HI> with its adjacent I&s;lands, which reaches from <HI>Mozambique</HI> to the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>We went from this I&s;land of <HI>Sall,</HI> to St <HI>Nicholas,</HI> another of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands, lying We&s;t South We&s;t from <HI>Sall,</HI> about 22 leagues. We arrived there the next day after we left the other, and An|chored on the S. E. &s;ide of the I&s;land. This is a pretty large I&s;land; it is one of the bigge&s;t of all the <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> and lieth in a triangular form. The large&s;t &s;ide, which lieth to the Ea&s;t, is about 30 leagues long, and the other two above 20 leagues each. It is a mountainous barren I&s;land, and rocky all round towards the Sea; yet in the heart of it, there are Valleys, where the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> which inha|bit here, have Vineyards and Plantations, and Wood for fewed. Here are many Goats, which are but poor in compari&s;on with tho&s;e in other places, yet much better than tho&s;e at <HI>Sall:</HI> There are likewi&s;e many A&s;&s;es. The Governor of this I&s;land came aboard us, with 3 or 4 Gentlemen more in his com|pany, who were all indifferently well cloathed, and accoutred with Swords and Pi&s;tols; but the re&s;t that accompanied him to the Sea-&s;ide, which were about 20 or 30 Men more, were but in a ragged garb. The Governor brought aboard &s;ome Wine made in the I&s;land, which ta&s;ted much like <HI>Madera</HI> Wine: It was of a pale colour, and lookt thick. He told us the chief Town was in a Valley 14 mile from the Bay where we rode; that he had there under him above one hundred Families, be&s;ides other Inhabitants that lived &s;cattering in Valleys more re|more.
<PB N="75" REF="95">
They were all very &s;warthy; the Gover|nor was the cleare&s;t of them, yet of a dark tawny complexion.</P>
<P>At this I&s;land we &s;crubb'd the bottom of our Ship, and here al&s;o we dug Wells a&s;hoar on the Bay, and fill'd all our Water, and after 5 or 6 days &s;tay, we went from hence to <HI>Mayo,</HI> another of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands, lying about 40 mile Ea&s;t and by South from the other; arriving there the next day, and anchoring on the N. W. &s;ide of the I&s;land. We &s;ent our Boat on &s;hoar, intending to have purcha&s;ed &s;ome Provi&s;ion, as Beef or Goats, with which this I&s;land is better &s;tock'd than the re&s;t of the I&s;lands. But the Inhabitants would not &s;uffer our Men to land; for about a week before our arrival there came an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, the Men of which came a&s;hoar, pre|tending friend&s;hip, and &s;eized on the Governour with &s;ome others, and carrying them aboard, made them &s;end a&s;hoar for Cattle to ran&s;om their Liber|ties: and yet after this &s;et &s;ail, and carried them away, and they had not heard of them &s;ince. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man that did this (as I was afterwards in|formed) was one Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> VVhether ever he brought back tho&s;e Men again I know not: He him&s;elf and mo&s;t of his Men have &s;ince gone over to the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> and 'twas he who had like to have burnt our Ship after this in the Bay of <HI>Pa|nama;</HI> as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to relate.</P>
<P>This I&s;le of <HI>Mayo</HI> is but &s;mall, and invironed with &s;holes, yet a place much frequented by &s;hipping for its great plenty of Salt: and though there is but bad landing, yet many Ships lade here every year. Here are plenty of Bulls, Cows and Goats; and at a certain &s;ea&s;on in the year, <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> a &s;ort of &s;mall Sea Tortoi&s;e come hither to lay their Eggs: but the&s;e Turtle are not &s;o &s;weet as tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> The inhabitants plant Corn, Yams, Potatoes, and &s;ome Plantains, and breed,

a few Fowls; living very poor, yet much better than the Inhabitants of any other of the&s;e I&s;lands, <HI>St Jago</HI> excepted, which lieth 4 or 5 leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Mayo,</HI> and is the chief, the mo&s;t fruit|ful, and be&s;t inhabited of all the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd;</HI> yet mountainous, and much barren Land in it.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;le <HI>St Jago</HI> is a good Port, which in peaceable times e&s;pecially is &s;eldom without Ships; for this hath long been a place which Ships have been wont to touch at for Water and Refre&s;hments, as tho&s;e outward-bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies, Engli&s;h, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> many of the Ships bound to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> to <HI>Surinam,</HI> and their own <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fleet going for <HI>Braziel,</HI> which is generally about the latter end of <HI>Septemb,</HI> but few Ships call in here in their return for <HI>Europe.</HI> When any Ships are here the Country People bring down their Commodities to &s;ell to the Sea-men and Pa&s;&s;engers, <HI>viz.</HI> Bullocks, Hogs, Goats, Fowls, Eggs, Plantains, and Coco Nuts, which they will give in exchange for Shirts, Drawers, Handker|chiefs, Hats, Wa&s;tecoa&s;ts, Britches, or in a man|ner for any &s;ort of Cloath, e&s;pecially Linnen, for Woollen is not much e&s;teemed there. They care not willingly to part with their Cattel of any &s;ort, but in exchange for Money, or Linnen, or &s;ome other valuable Commodity. Travellers mu&s;t have a care of the&s;e People, for they are very thievi&s;h; and if they &s;ee an opportunity will &s;natch any thing from you, and run away with it. We did not touch at this I&s;land in this Voyage; but I was there before this in the year 1670, when I &s;aw a Fort here lying on the top of an Hill, and com|manding the Harbour.</P>
<P>The Governor of this I&s;land is chief over all the re&s;t of the I&s;lands. I have been told that there are two large Towns on this I&s;land, &s;ome &s;mall Villages,
<PB N="77" REF="97">
and a great many Inhabitants; and that they make a great deal of Wine, &s;uch as is that of <HI>St Nicholas.</HI> I have not been on any other of the <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands, nor near them; but have &s;een mo&s;t of them at a di&s;tance. They &s;eem to be mountainous and batren; &s;ome of the&s;e before-mentioned being the mo&s;t fruitful and mo&s;t frequented by Strangers, e&s;pecilly <HI>St Jago</HI> and <HI>Mayo.</HI> As to the re&s;t of them, <HI>Fogo</HI> and <HI>Brava</HI> are two &s;mall I&s;lands lying to the We&s;tward of <HI>St Jago,</HI> but of little note; only <HI>Fogo</HI> is remarkable for its being a <HI>Vulcano:</HI> It is all of it one large Mountain of a good heighth, out of the top whereof i&s;&s;ue Flames of Fire, yet only di&s;cerned in the night: and then it may be &s;een a great way at Sea. Yet this I&s;land is not without inhabitants, who live at the foot of the Mountain near the Sea. Their &s;ub&s;tance is much the &s;ame as in the other I&s;lands; they have &s;ome Goats, Fowls, Plantains, Coco-Nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I am informed. Of the Plan|tains and Coco-Nuts I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak when I come into the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies;</HI> and &s;hall defer the giving an account of them till then.</P>
<P>The remainder of the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> are <HI>St Anthonia, St Lucia, St Vincente,</HI> and <HI>Bona-Vi&s;ta:</HI> of which I know nothing con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Our entrance among the&s;e I&s;lands was from the North Ea&s;t; for in our pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Virginia</HI> we ran pretty far toward the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gualata</HI> in <HI>Africk,</HI> to pre&s;erve the Trade-wind, le&s;t we &s;hould be born off too much to the We&s;tward, and &s;o lo&s;e the I&s;lands.

<P><HI>Sherboro</HI> was a good way from us, &s;o I can give no account of the place, or our Factory there; &s;ave that I have been informed, that there is a con&s;iderable Trade driven there for a &s;ort of red Wood for dying, which grows in that Country very plentifully, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> called by our people <HI>Cam-wood.</HI> A little within the &s;hoar where we anchored was a Town of Negroes, Natives of this Coa&s;t.

<P>From the time that we were in 10 deg. South, till we came to the&s;e I&s;lands, we had the Wind be|tween E. N. E. and the N. N. E. fair weather, and a bri&s;k gale.

<P><HI>March</HI> the 22d, 1684. we came in &s;ight of the I&s;land, and the next day got in and anchored in a Bay at the South end of the I&s;land, in 25 fathom Water, not two Cables lengths from the &s;hore.

He had with him his Gun and a Knife, with a &s;mall Horn of Powder, and a few Shot; which being &s;pent, he contrived a way by notching his Knife, to &s;aw the Barrel of his Gun into &s;mall Pieces, wherewith he made Harpoons, Lances, Hooks and a long Knife; heating the pieces fir&s;t in the fire, which he &s;truck with his Gun|flint,

<P>Other wild <HI>Indians</HI> who have not the u&s;e of Iron, which the <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI> Men have from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> make Hatchets of a very hard Stone, with which they will cut down Trees, (the Cotton-Tree e&s;pecially, which is a &s;oft tender Wood) to build their Hou&s;es or make Canoas; and tho' in working their Canoas hollow, they cannot dig them &s;o neat and thin, yet they will make them fit for their Service. This their Digging or Hatchet-work they help out by Fire; whether for the felling of the Trees, or for the making the in&s;ide of their Canoa hollow. The&s;e Contrivances are u&s;ed particularly by the Savage <HI>In|dians</HI> of <HI>Blewfield</HI>'s River, de&s;cribed in the 3d Chap|ter, who&s;e Canoas and Stone-Hatchets I have &s;een. The&s;e Stone-Hatchets are about 10 Inches long, 4 bread, and 3 Inches thick in the middle. They are grownd away flat and &s;harp at both ends: Right in the mid&s;t, and clear round it they make a notch, &s;o wide and deep that a Man might place his Fin|ger along it, and taking a &s;tick or withe about 4 foot long, they bind it round the Hatchet-head, in that notch, and &s;o twi&s;ting it hard, u&s;e it as an handle or helve; the head being held by it very fa&s;t. Nor are other wild <HI>Indians</HI> le&s;s ingenious. Tho&s;e of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> particularly, head their Arrows

with Flint, cut or ground; which I have &s;een and admired. But to return to our <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI> Man on the I&s;le of <HI>J. Fernando.</HI> With &s;uch In&s;truments as he made in that manner, he got &s;uch Provi&s;ion as the I&s;land afforded; either Goats or Fi&s;h. He told us that at fir&s;t he was forced to eat Seal, which is very ordinary Meat, before he had made hooks: but afterwards he never killed any Seals but to make Lines, cutting their Skins into Thongs. He had a little Hou&s;e or Hut half a mile from the Sea, which was lined with Goats Skin; his Couch or Barbecu of Sticks lying along about 2 foot di&s;tant from the Ground, was &s;pread with the &s;ame, and was all his Bedding. He had no Cloaths left, having worn out tho&s;e he brought from <HI>Waltin</HI>'s Ship, but only a Skin about his Wa&s;te. He &s;aw our Ship the day before we came to an Anchor, and did believe we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore kill'd 3 Goats in the Morning, before we came to an Anchor, and dre&s;t them with Cabbage, to treat us when we came a|&s;hore. He came then to the Sea &s;ide to cogratulate our &s;afe arrival. And when we landed, a <HI>Mo&s;kito Indian,</HI> named <HI>Robin,</HI> fir&s;t leap'd a&s;hore, and running to his Brother <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI> Man, threw him&s;elf flat on his face at his feet, who helping him up, and em|bracing him, fell flat with his face on the Ground at <HI>Robin</HI>'s feet, and was by him taken up al&s;o. We &s;tood with plea&s;ure to behold the &s;uprize and ten|derne&s;s, and &s;olemnity of this interview, which was exceedingly affectionate on both &s;ides; and when their Ceremonies of Civility were over, we al&s;o that &s;tood gazing at them drew near, each of us embracing him we had found here, who was over|joyed to &s;ee &s;o many of his old Friends come hither as he thought purpo&s;ely to fetch him. He was named <HI>Will,</HI> as the other was <HI>Robin.</HI> The&s;e were names given them by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for they have no Names among them&s;elves; and they take it as a great favour to be
<PB N="87" REF="107">
named by any of us; and will complain for want of it, if we do not appoint them &s;ome name when they are with us: &s;aying of them&s;elves they are poor Men, and have no Name.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is in lat. 34 d. 15 m. and about 120 leagues from the Main. It is about 12 leagues round, full of high Hills, and &s;mall plea&s;ant Valleys; which if manured, would probably produce any thing proper for the Climate. The &s;ides of the Moun|tains are part Savannahs, part Wood-land. Savannahs are clear pieces of Land without Woods; not be|cau&s;e more barren than the Wood-land, for they are frequently &s;pots of as good Land as any, and often are intermixt with Wood-land. In the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> are very large Savannahs, which I have &s;een full of Cattle: But about the River of <HI>Plate</HI> are the large&s;t that every I heard of, 50, 60, or 100 Miles in length; and <HI>Jamaica, Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> have many Savannahs intermixt with Woods. Places cleared of Wood by Art and Labour do not go by this Name, but tho&s;e only which are found &s;o in the uninhabited parts of <HI>America,</HI> &s;uch as this I&s;le of <HI>John Fernando's;</HI> or which were originally clear in other parts.</P>
<P>The Gra&s;s in the&s;e Savannahs at <HI>John Fernando</HI>'s is not a long flaggy Gra&s;s, &s;uch as is u&s;ually in the Sa|vannahs in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but a &s;ort of kindly Gra&s;s, both thick and flouri&s;hing the bigge&s;t part of the year. The Woods afford divers &s;orts of Trees; &s;ome large and good Timber for Building, but none fit for Ma&s;ts. The Cabbage Trees of this I&s;le are but &s;mall and low; yet afford a good head, and the Cabbage very &s;weet. This Tree I &s;hall de&s;cribe in the Appendix in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy.</HI></P>
<P>The Savannahs are &s;tocked with Goats in great Herds: but tho&s;e that live on the Ea&s;t end of the I&s;land are not &s;o fat as tho&s;e on the We&s;t end; for though there is much more Gra&s;s, and plenty of
<PB N="88" REF="108">
Water in every Valley, neverthele&s;s they thrive not &s;o well here as on the We&s;t-end, where there is le&s;s Food; and yet there are found greater Flocks, and tho&s;e too fatter and &s;weeter.</P>
<P>That We&s;t end of the I&s;land is all high Champi|on Ground without any Valley, and but one place to land; there is neither Wood nor any fre&s;h Water, and the Gra&s;s &s;hort and dry.</P>
<P>Goats were fir&s;t put on the I&s;land by <HI>John Fer|nando,</HI> who fir&s;t di&s;covered it in his Voyage from <HI>Lima</HI> to <HI>Baldivia;</HI> (and di&s;covered al&s;o another I&s;land about the &s;ame bigne&s;s, 20 leagues to the We&s;tward of this.) From tho&s;e Goats the&s;e were propagated, and the I&s;land hath taken its Name from this its fir&s;t Di&s;coverer; who, when he returned to <HI>Lima,</HI> de|&s;ired a Patent for it, de&s;igning to &s;ettle here; and it was in his &s;econd Voyage hither that he &s;et a&s;hore 3 or 4 Goats, which have &s;ince, by their increa&s;e, &s;o well &s;tock'd the whole I&s;land. But he could never get a Patent for it, therefore it lies &s;till de&s;titute of Inhabitants, tho' doubtle&s;s capable of maintaining 4 or 500 Families, by what may be produced off the Land only. I &s;peak much within compa&s;s; for the Savannahs would at pre&s;ent feed 1000 Head of Cattle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Goats, and the Land being cultivated would probably bear Corn, or Wheat, and good Pea&s;e, Yams, or Potatoes; for the Land in their Valleys and &s;ides of the Mountains, is of a good black fruitful Mould. The Sea about it is likewi&s;e very productive of its Inhabitants. <HI>Seals</HI> &s;warmas thick about this I&s;land, as if they had no other place in the World to live in; for there is not a Bay nor Rock that one can get a&s;hoar on, but is full of them. <HI>Sea Lyons</HI> are here in great Companies, and Fi&s;h, par|ticularly Snappers and Rock-fi&s;h, are &s;o plentiful, that two Men in an hours time will take with Hook and Line, as many as will &s;erve 100 Men.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="109">
The <HI>Seals</HI> are a &s;ort of Creatures pretty well known, yet it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe them. They are as big as Calves, the Head of them like a Dog, therefore called by the <HI>Dutch</HI> the <HI>Sea-hounds.</HI> Under each Shoulder grows a long thick Fin: The&s;e &s;erve them to &s;wim with when in the Sea, and are in&s;tead of Legs to them when on the Land for rai&s;ing their Bodies up on end, by the help of the&s;e Fins or Stumps, and &s;o having their Tail-parts drawn clo&s;e under them, they rebound, as it were, and throw their Bodies forward, drawing their hinder parts after them; and then again ri&s;ing up, and &s;pringing forward with their fore-parts alternately, they lie tumbling thus up and down, all the while they are moving on Land. From their Shoulders to their Tails they grow tapering like Fi&s;h, and have two &s;mall Fins on each &s;ide the Rump: which is commonly covered with their Fins. The&s;e Fins &s;erve in&s;tead of a Tail in the Sea; and on Land they &s;it on them, when they give &s;uck to their young. Their Hair is of divers Colours, as black, grey, dun, &s;potted, looking very &s;leek and plea&s;ant when they come fir&s;t out of the Sea: For the&s;e at <HI>John Fernan|do</HI>'s have fine thick &s;hort Furr; the like I have not taken notice of any where but in the&s;e Seas. Here are always thou&s;ands, I might &s;ay po&s;&s;ibly millions of them, either &s;itting on the Bays, or going and coming in the Sea round the I&s;land, which is co|vered with them (as they lie at the top of the Wa|ter playing and &s;unning them&s;elves) for a mile or two from the &s;hore. When they come out of the Sea they bleat like Sheep for their young; and though they pa&s;s through hundreds of others young ones before they come to their own, yet they will not &s;uffer any of them to &s;uck. The young ones are like Puppies, and lie much a&s;hore, but when beaten by any of us, they, as well as the old ones, will make towards the Sea, and &s;wim very &s;wift
<PB N="90" REF="110">
and nimble; tho' on &s;hore they lie very &s;luggi&s;hly, and will not go out of our ways unle&s;s we beat them, but &s;nap at us. A blow on the No&s;e &s;oon kills them. Large Ships might here load them&s;elves with Seals Skins and Trane-oyl; for thy are extra|ordinary fat. Seals are found as well in cold as hot Climates; and in the cold places they love to get on Lumps of Ice, where they will lie and &s;un them|&s;elves, as here on the Land: They are frequent in the Northern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and in the Southern parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> as about the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and at the <HI>Streights of Magellan:</HI> And tho' I never &s;aw any in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> at certain I&s;lands called the <HI>Alceranes,</HI> and at others called the <HI>De&s;arts;</HI> yet they are over all the <HI>American</HI> Coa&s;t of the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> from <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> up to the Equinoctial Line; but to the North of the Equinox again, in the&s;e Seas, I never &s;aw any, till as far as 21 North lat. Nor did I ever &s;ee any in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> In general they &s;eem to re|&s;ort where there is plenty of Fi&s;h, for that is their Food; and Fi&s;h, &s;uch as they feed on, as Cods, Groopers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are mo&s;t plentiful on rocky Coa&s;ts: and &s;uch is mo&s;tly this We&s;tern Coa&s;t of the South <HI>America,</HI> as I &s;hall further relate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sea-Lion</HI> is a large Creature about 12 or 14 foot long. The bigge&s;t part of his Body is as big as a Bull: It is &s;haped like a <HI>Seal,</HI> but 6 times as big. The Head is like a Lion's Head; it hath a broad Face, with many long Hairs growing about its Lips like a Cat. It has a great goggle Eye, the Teeth 3 Inches long, about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Thumb; In Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI>'s time &s;ome of our Men made Dice with them. They have no Hair on their Bodies like the <HI>Seal;</HI> they are of a dun colour, and are all extraor|dinary fat; one of them being cut up and boiled, will yield a Hog&s;head of Oil, which is very &s;weet and whol&s;ome to fry Meat withal. The lean Fle&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="111">
is black, and of a cour&s;e Grain, yet indifferent good Food. They will lie a week at a time a&s;hore if not di&s;turbed: Where 3 or 4, or more of them, come a|&s;hore together; they huddle one on another like Swine, and grunt like them, making a hideous noi&s;e. They eat Fi&s;h, which I believe is their com|mon Food.</P>
<P>The <HI>Snapper</HI> is a Fi&s;h much like a <HI>Roach,</HI> but a great deal bigger. It hath a large Head and Mouth, and great Gills. The Back is of a bright red, the Belly of a Silver Colour: The Scales are as broad as a Shilling. The <HI>Snapper</HI> is excellent Meat. They are in many places in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the <HI>South-Seas:</HI> I have not &s;een them any where be&s;ide.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rock-fi&s;h</HI> is called by Seamen a <HI>Grooper;</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it a <HI>Baccalao,</HI> which is the name for Cod, becau&s;e it is much like it. It is rounder than the <HI>Snapper,</HI> of a dark brown colour; and hath &s;mall Scales no bigger than a Silver-penny. This Fi&s;h is good &s;weet Meat, and is found in great plenty on all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI></P>
<P>There are only two Bays in the whole I&s;land where Ships may anchor; the&s;e are both at the Ea&s;t-end, and in both of them is a Rivolet of good fre&s;h Water. Either of the&s;e Bays may be fortified with little charge, to that degree that 50 Men in each may be able to keep off 1000; and there is no com|ing into the&s;e Bays from the We&s;t-end, but with great difficulty, over the Mountains, where if 3 Men are placed, they may keep down as many as come a|gain&s;t them on any &s;ide. This was partly experien|ced by 5 <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> that Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> left here, who defended them&s;elves again&s;t a great Body of <HI>Spani|ards</HI> who landed in the Bays, and came here to de|&s;troy them; and tho' the &s;econd time one of their Con&s;orts de&s;erted and fled to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet the other 4 kept their Ground, and were afterward ta|ken in from hence by Capt. <HI>Strong</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1684" UNIT="year"> THE 8th of <HI>April,</HI> 1684. we &s;ailed from the I&s;le of <HI>J. Fernando,</HI> with the Wind at S. E. We were now two Ships in Company: Captain <HI>Cook</HI>'s,
<PB N="94" REF="114">
who&s;e Ship I was in, and who here took the Sick|ne&s;s of which he died a while after; and Captain <HI>Eaton</HI>'s. Our pa&s;&s;age lay now along the <HI>Pacifick Sea,</HI> properly &s;o called. For tho' it be u&s;ual with our Map-makers to give that Name to this whole O|cean, calling it <HI>Mare Au&s;trale, Mal del Zur,</HI> or <HI>Mare Pacificum;</HI> yet, in my opinion, the Name of the <HI>Pacifick Sea</HI> ought not to be extended from South to North farther than from 30 to about 4 deg. South Latitude, and from the <HI>American</HI> &s;hore We&s;tward indefinitely, with re&s;pect to my ob&s;ervation; who have been in the&s;e parts 250 Leagues or more from Land, and &s;till had the Sea very quiet from Winds. For in all this Tract of Water, of which I have &s;poken, there are no dark rainy Clouds, tho' often a thick Horizon, &s;o as to hinder an Ob&s;ervation of the Sun with the Quadrant; and in the Morning hazy weather frequently, and thick Mi&s;ts, but &s;carce able to wet one. Nor are there in this Sea any Winds but the Trade-wind, no Tempe&s;t, no Tornadoes or Hurricanes (tho' North of the Equator, they are met with as well in this Ocean as in the Atlantick) yet the Sea it &s;elf at the new and full of the Moon runs with high, large, long Surges, but &s;uch as never break out at Sea, and &s;o are &s;afe enough; unle&s;s that where they fell in and break upon the Shore, they make it bad landing.</P>
<P>In this Sea we made the be&s;t of our way toward the Line, till in the lat. of 24 S. where we fell in with the main Land of the <HI>South America.</HI> All this cour&s;e of the Land, both of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Pern</HI> is va&s;tly high; therefore we kept 12 or 14 leagues off from &s;hore, being unwilling to be &s;een by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dwelling there. The Land (e&s;pecially beyond this, from 24 deg. S. Lat. 17. and from 14 to 10) is of a mo&s;t prodigious heighth. It lies generally in Ridges parallel to the &s;hore, and 3 or 4 Ridges, one with another, each &s;urpa&s;&s;ing other in heighth;
<PB N="95" REF="115">
and tho&s;e that are farthe&s;t within Land, are much higher than others. They always appear blue when &s;een at Sea; &s;ometimes they are ob&s;cur'd with Clouds, but not &s;o often as the high Lands in other parts of the World; for here are &s;eldom or never any Rains on the&s;e Hills, any more than in the Sea near it; neither are they &s;ubject to Fogs. The&s;e are the high|e&s;t Mountains that ever I &s;aw, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Tenariffe,</HI> or <HI>Santa Martha,</HI> and, I believe, any Mountains in the World.</P>
<P>I have &s;een very high Land in the Lat of 30 South, but not &s;o high as in the Latitudes before de&s;cribed. In Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Voyage al&s;o to <HI>Baldivia</HI> (a City on this Coa&s;t) mention is made of very high Land &s;een near <HI>Baldivia:</HI> and the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> with whom I have di&s;cour&s;ed, have told me, that there is a very high Land all the way between <HI>Coquimbo</HI> (which lies in about 30 d. South. lat.) and <HI>Baldivia,</HI> which is in 40 South; &s;o that by all likeli|hood the&s;e Ridges of Mountains do run in a conti|nued Chain from one end of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili</HI> to the other, all along this South-Sea Coa&s;t, called u&s;ually the <HI>Andes,</HI> or <HI>Sierra Nuevada des Andes.</HI> The exce&s;&s;ive heighth of the&s;e Mountains may po&s;&s;ibly be the rea&s;on that there are no Rivers of note that fall in|to the&s;e Seas. Some &s;mall Rivers indeed there are, but very few of them, for in &s;ome places there is not one that comes out into the Sea in 150 or 200 Leagues, and where they are thicke&s;t they are 30, 40, or 50 Leagues a&s;under, and too little and &s;hallow to be Navigable. Be&s;ides, &s;ome of the&s;e do not con|&s;tantly run, but are dry at certain Sea&s;ons of the Year; as the River of <HI>Ylo,</HI> runs flu&s;h with a quick Current at the latter end of <HI>January,</HI> and &s;o con|tinues till <HI>June,</HI> and then it decrea&s;eth by degrees, growing le&s;s, and running &s;low till the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> when it fails wholly, and runs no more till <HI>January</HI> again: This I have &s;een at both Sea|&s;ons,
<PB N="96" REF="116">
in 2 former Voyages I made hither, and have been informed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that other Rivers on this Coa&s;t are of the like Nature, being rather Torrents or Land-floods cau&s;ed by their Rains at cer|tain Sea&s;ons far within Land, than perennial &s;treams.</P>
<P>We kept &s;till along in &s;ight of this Coa&s;t, but at a good di&s;tance from it, encountring with nothing of note, till in the lat of 9 deg. 40 min. South, on the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> we de&s;cried a Sail to the Northward of us. She was plying to Windward, we cha&s;ed her, and Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> being a head &s;oon took her: She came from <HI>Guiaquil</HI> about a Month before, laden with Timber, and was bound to <HI>Lima.</HI> Three days before we took her, &s;he came from <HI>Santa,</HI> whither &s;he had gone for Water, and where they had news of our being in the&s;e Seas by an expre&s;s from <HI>Baldi|via;</HI> for, as we afterwards heard, Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> had been at <HI>Baldivia</HI> to &s;eek a Trade there, and he having met Capt <HI>Eaton</HI> in the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Baldivia</HI> were doubtle&s;s informed of us by him, &s;u&s;pecting him al&s;o to be one of us, tho' he was not. Upon this News the Vice-roy of <HI>Lima</HI> &s;ent Expre&s;&s;es to all the Sea Ports, that they might pro|vide them&s;elves again&s;t our A&s;&s;aults.</P>
<P>We immediately &s;teered away for the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> which lieth in lat. 6 d. 24 m. South lat. (I took the Elevation of it a&s;hore with an A&s;trolabe) and it is 5 leagues from the Main. It is called <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another that is not far from it, and extreamly like it, called <HI>Lobos de la Terra,</HI> for it lies nearer the Main. <HI>Lobos,</HI> or <HI>Lovos,</HI> is the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Name for a Seal, of which there are great plenty about the&s;e, and &s;everal other I&s;lands in the&s;e Seas that go by this Name.</P>
<P>The 9th of <HI>May</HI> we arrived at this I&s;le of <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> and came to an anchor with our Prize. This <HI>Lobos</HI> con&s;i&s;ts indeed of two little I&s;lands, each a|bout a Mile round, of an indifferent heighth, a
<PB N="97" REF="117">
&s;mall Channel between, fit for Boats only; and &s;e|veral Rocks lying on the North &s;ide of the I&s;lands a little way from &s;hoar. There is a &s;mall Cove or Sandy-Bay &s;heltred from the Winds, at the We&s;t end of the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land, where Ships may Carreen: The re&s;t of the &s;hoar, as well round the two I&s;lands as between them, is a Rocky Coa&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall Cliffs. Within Land, they are both of them partly Rocky, and partly Sandy, Barren, without any fre&s;h Water, Tree, Shrub, Gra&s;s, or Herbs; or any Land Animals (for the Seals and Sea-Lions come a&s;hoar here) but Fowls: Of which there are great multitudes; as <HI>Boobies,</HI> but mo&s;tly <HI>Penguins,</HI> which I have &s;een plentifully all over the <HI>South Seas;</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> They are a Sea-Fowl, about as big as a Duck, and &s;uch Feet; but a &s;harp Bill, feeding on Fi&s;h. They do not fly but flutter, having rather &s;tumps like a young Go&s;lin's, than Wings: And the&s;e are in&s;tead of Fins to them in the Water. Their Feathers are Downy. Their fle&s;h is but ordi|nary Food; but their Eggs are good Meat. There is another &s;ort of &s;mall black Fowl, that make holes in the Sand for their Night Habitations, who&s;e fle&s;h is good &s;weet meat. I never &s;aw any of them but here, and at <HI>John Fernando</HI>'s.</P>
<P>There is good Riding between the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land and the Rocks, in ten, twelve, or fourteen Fathom; for the Wind is commonly at S. or S. S. E. and the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t, &s;hel|ters that Road.</P>
<P>Here we &s;crubb'd our Ships, and being in a readi|ne&s;s to &s;ail, the Pri&s;oners were examined, to know if any of them could conduct us to &s;ome Town where we might make &s;ome attempt; for they had before informed us, that we were de&s;cried by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by that we knew that they would &s;end no Riches by Sea &s;o long as we were here. Many
<PB N="98" REF="118">
Towns were con&s;idered on, as <HI>Guiaquil, Zana, Trux|illo,</HI> and others: At la&s;t <HI>Truxillo</HI> was pitched on, as the mo&s;t important; therefore the likelie&s;t to make us a Voyage if we could conquer it: which we did not much que&s;tion, though we knew it to be a very populous City. But the greate&s;t difficulty was in landing; for <HI>Guanchaquo,</HI> which is the near|e&s;t Sea-port to it, but 6 miles off, is an ill place to Land, &s;ince &s;ometimes the very Fi&s;hermen, that live there, are not able to go in 3 or 4 days. How|ever the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> in the Afternoon, our Men were mu&s;tered of both Ships Companies, and their Arms proved. We were in all 108 Men fit for &s;er|vice, be&s;ides the &s;ick: and the next day we intend|ed to &s;ail and take the <HI>Wood</HI> Prize with us. But the next day one of our Men being a&s;hoar betimes on the I&s;land, de&s;cried three Sail bound to the North|ward; two of them without the I&s;land to the We&s;t|ward, the other between it and the Continent.</P>
<P>We &s;oon got our Anchors up and cha&s;ed: and Captain <HI>Eaton,</HI> who drew the lea&s;t draught of Wa|ter, put through between the We&s;termo&s;t-I&s;land and the Rocks, and went after tho&s;e two that were with|out the I&s;lands. We in Captain <HI>Cook's</HI> Ship went after the other which &s;tood in for the Main-Land, but we &s;oon fetched her up, and having taken her, &s;tood in again with her to the I&s;land; for we &s;aw that Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> wanted no help, having taken both tho&s;e that he went after. He came in with one of his Prizes, but the other was &s;o far to Leeward, and &s;o deep, that he could not then get her in, but he hoped to get her in the next day: but being deep laden, as de&s;igned to go down before the wind to <HI>Panama,</HI> &s;he would not bear &s;ail.</P>
<P>The 10th day &s;he turned all day, but got nothing nearer the I&s;land. Our <HI>Mo&s;kito-&s;trikers,</HI> according to their cu&s;tom, went and &s;truck &s;ix Turtles; for here are indifferent plenty of them. The&s;e Ships
<PB N="99" REF="119">
that we took the day before we came from <HI>Guancha|quo,</HI> all three laden with Flower, bound for <HI>Pana|ma.</HI> Two of them were laden as deep as they could &s;wim, the other was not above half laden, but was ordered by the Vice-Roy of <HI>Lima</HI> to &s;ail with the other two, or el&s;e &s;he &s;hould not &s;ail till we were gone out of the Seas; for he hoped they might e&s;cape us by &s;etting out early. In the bigge&s;t Ship was a Letter to the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama</HI> from the Vice-Roy of <HI>Lima;</HI> a&s;&s;uring him, that there were Enemies come into that Sea: for which rea&s;on he had di&s;patched the&s;e three Ships with Flower, that they might not want; (for <HI>Panama</HI> is &s;upplied from <HI>Peru</HI>;) and de&s;ired him to be frugal of it, for he knew not when he &s;hould &s;end more. In this Ship were likewi&s;e 7 or 8 Tuns of Marmalade of Quinces, and a &s;tately Mule &s;ent to the Pre&s;ident, and a very large Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in Wood, carved and painted to adorn a new Church at <HI>Panama,</HI> and &s;ent from <HI>Lima</HI> by the Vice-Roy; for this great Ship came from thence not long before. She brought al&s;o from <HI>Lima</HI> 800000 Pieces of Eight, to carry withher to <HI>Panama:</HI> but while &s;he lay at <HI>Guanchaco,</HI> taking in her lading of Flower, the Merchants hearing of Capt. <HI>Swan</HI>'s being at <HI>Baldivia,</HI> order'd the Money a&s;hoar a|gain. The&s;e Pri&s;oners likewi&s;e informed us, that the Gentlemen (Inhabitants of <HI>Truxillo</HI>) were building a Fort at <HI>Guanchaquo</HI> (which is the Sea-Port for <HI>Truxil|lo</HI>) clo&s;e by the Sea, purpo&s;ely to hinder the de&s;igns of any that &s;hould attempt to land there. Upon this news we altered our former re&s;olutions, and re&s;ol|ved to go with our three Prizes to the <HI>Gallapagos,</HI> which are a great many large I&s;lands, lying &s;ome under the Equator, others on each &s;ide of it. I &s;hall here omit the de&s;cription of <HI>Truxillo,</HI> becau&s;e in my Appendix, at the latter end of the Book, I intend to give a general Relation of mo&s;t of the Towns of note on this Coa&s;t, from <HI>Baldivia</HI> to <HI>Panama,</HI> and from thence towards <HI>California.</HI></P>

The 19th day in the evening we &s;ailed from the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> with Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> in our Company. We carried the three Flower Prizes with us, but our fir&s;t Prize Laden with Timber, we left here at an Anchor; the Wind was at S. by E. which is the common Trade-Wind here, and we &s;teered away N. W. by N. intending to run into the latitude of the I&s;les <HI>Gallapagos,</HI> and &s;teer off We&s;t, becau&s;e we did not know the certain di&s;tance, and therefore could not &s;hape a direct Cour&s;e to them. When we came within 40 minutes of the Equator, we &s;teer'd We&s;t, having the Wind at South, a very moderate gentle Gale. It was the 31&s;t day of <HI>May</HI> when we fir&s;t had &s;ight of the I&s;lands <HI>Gallapagos:</HI> Some of them appeared on our Weather-bow, &s;ome on our Lee-bow, others right a head. We at fir&s;t &s;ight trimm'd our Sails, and &s;teered as nigh the Wind as we could, &s;triving to get to the Southermo&s;t of them, but our Prizes being deep laden, their Sails but &s;mall and thin, and a very &s;mall Gale, they could not keep up with us; therefore we likewi&s;e edged away again, a point from the Wind, to keep near them, and in the evening, the Ship that I was in, and Captain <HI>Eaton,</HI> Anchored on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of one of the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;lands a Mile from the &s;hoar, in &s;ixteen fathom Water, clean, white, hard Sand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gallapagos</HI> I&s;lands are a great Number of un|inhabited I&s;lands, lying under, and on both &s;ides of the Equator. The Fa&s;termo&s;t of them are about 110 Leagues from the Main. They are laid down in the Longitude of 181, reaching to the We&s;tward as far as 176, therefore their Longitude from <HI>England</HI> We&s;tward is about 68 degrees. But I believe our Hy|drographers do not place them far enough to the We&s;tward. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> who fir&s;t di&s;covered them, and in who&s;e draughts alone they are laid down, re|port them to be a great number, &s;tretching North-We&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="121">
from the Line, as far as 5 degrees N. but we &s;aw not above 14 or 15. They are &s;ome of them 7 or 8 leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. They are of a good heighth, mo&s;t of them flat and even on the top; 4 or 5 of the Ea&s;termo&s;t are rocky, barren and hilly, producing neither Tree, Herb, nor Gra&s;s, but a few Dildo-trees, except by the Sea &s;ide. The Dildo-tree is a green prickly Shrub, that grows a|bout 10 or 12 foot high, without either Leaf or Fruit. It is as big as a Man's Leg, from the root to the top, and it is full of &s;harp prickles, growing in thick rows from top to bottom; this &s;hrub is fit for no u&s;e, not &s;o much as to burn. Clo&s;e by the Sea there grows in &s;ome places bu&s;hes of Burton Wood, which is very good firing. This &s;ort of Wood grows in many places in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and in the <HI>Sambaloes.</HI> I did never &s;ee any in the&s;e Seas but here. There is Water on the&s;e barren I&s;lands, in Ponds and Holes among the Rocks. Some other of the&s;e I&s;lands are mo&s;tly plain and low, and the Land more fertile, producing Trees of divers &s;orts, unknown to us. Some of the We&s;termo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands are nine or ten leagues long, and &s;ix or &s;even broad; the Mould deep and black. The&s;e produce Trees of great and tall bo|dies, e&s;pecially Mammee-trees, which grow here in great Groves. In the&s;e large I&s;lands there are &s;ome pretty big Rivers; and on many of the other le&s;&s;er I&s;lands there are Brooks of good Water. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> when they fir&s;t di&s;covered the&s;e I&s;lands, found multitudes of Guanoes, and Land-turtle or Tortoi&s;e, and named them the <HI>Gallapago's</HI> I&s;lands. I do be|lieve there is no place in the World that is &s;o plen|tifully &s;tored with the&s;e Animals. The Guanoes here are as fat and large as any that ever I &s;aw; they are &s;o tame, that a Man may knock down twenty in an hours time with a Club. The Land|turtle are here &s;o numerous, that 5 or 600 men might
<PB N="102" REF="122">
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on them alone for &s;everal months, without any other &s;ort of Provi&s;ion: They are extraordinary large and fat; and &s;o &s;weet, that no Pullet eats more plea&s;antly. One of the large&s;t of the&s;e Creatures will weigh 150 or 200 weight, and &s;ome of them are 2 foot, or 2 foot 6 Inches over the Challapee or Belly. I did never &s;ee any but at this place, that will weigh above 30 Pound weight. I have heard that at the I&s;le of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> or <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fore&s;t, an I&s;land near it, called al&s;o <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ma&s;carin,</HI> and now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> there are very large ones, but whether &s;o big, fat, and &s;weet as the&s;e, I know not. There are 3 or 4 &s;orts of the&s;e Creatures in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> One is called by the <HI>Spaniards, Hecatee;</HI> the&s;e live mo&s;t in fre&s;h Water|ponds, and &s;eldom come on Land. They weigh about 10 or 15 pound; they have &s;mall Legs and flat Feet, and &s;mall long Necks. Another &s;ort is called <HI>Tenapen;</HI> the&s;e are a great deal le&s;s than the <HI>Hecatee;</HI> the Shell on their Backs is all carved natu|rally, finely wrought, and well clouded: the Backs of the&s;e are rounder than tho&s;e before-mentioned; they are otherwi&s;e much of the &s;ame form: the&s;e delight to live in wet &s;wampy places, or on the Land near &s;uch places. Both the&s;e &s;orts are very good Meat. They are in great plenty on the I&s;le of <HI>Pines</HI> near <HI>Cuba:</HI> there the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hunters when they meet them in the Woods bring them home to their Huts, and mark them by notching their Shells, then let them go; this they do to have them at hand, for they never ramble far from thence. When the&s;e Hunters return to <HI>Cubo,</HI> after about a Month or &s;ix Weeks &s;tay, they carry with them 3 or 400, or more of the&s;e Creatures to &s;ell; for they are very good Meat, and every Man knows his own by their Marks. The&s;e Tortoi&s;e in the <HI>Gallapago's</HI> are more like the <HI>Hecatee,</HI> except that, as I &s;aid before, they are much bigger; and they have very long &s;mall
<PB N="103" REF="123">
necks and little heads. There are &s;ome green Snakes on the&s;e I&s;lands, but no other Land-Animal that I did ever &s;ee. There are great plenty of Turtle-Doves &s;o tame, that a Man may kill 5 or 6 dozen in a forenoon with a &s;tick. They are &s;omewhat le&s;s than a Pigeon, and are very good meat, and commonly fat.</P>
<P>There are good wide Channels between the&s;e I&s;lands fit for Ships to pa&s;s, and in &s;ome places &s;hole water, where there grows plenty of Turtle-gra&s;s; therefore the&s;e I&s;lands are plentifully &s;tored with Sea-Turtle, of that &s;ort which is called the green Turtle. I have hitherto deferred the de&s;cription of the&s;e Creatures, therefore I &s;hall give it here. There are 4 &s;orts of Sea-Turtle, <HI>viz.</HI> the Trunk-turtle, the Log|gerhead, the Hawks-bill, and the Green-Turtle. The Trunk-turtle is commonly bigger than the other, their backs are higher and rounder, and their fle&s;h rank and not whol&s;ome. The Loggerhead is &s;o call'd becau&s;e it hath a great head, much bigger than the other &s;orts; their fle&s;h is likewi&s;e very rank, and &s;el|dom eaten but in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity: they feed on Mo&s;s that grows about Rocks. The Hawks-bill Tur|tle is the leaft kind, they are &s;o call'd becau&s;e their mouths are long and &s;mall, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the Bill of a Hawk: On the backs of the&s;e Hawks-bill Turtle grows that &s;hell which is &s;o much e&s;teem'd for making Cabinets, Combs, and other things. The large&s;t of them may have three pound and an half of &s;hell; I have taken &s;ome that have had 3 pound 10 Ounces: but they commonly have a pound and half, or two Pound; &s;ome not &s;o much. The&s;e are but ordinary food, but generally &s;weeter than the Loggerhead: yet the&s;e Hawks-bills, in &s;ome places, are unwhol&s;ome, cau&s;ing them that eat them to purge and vomit exce&s;&s;ively, e&s;pecially tho&s;e be|tween the <HI>Sambaloes</HI> and <HI>Portobel.</HI> We meet with other Fi&s;h in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> of the &s;ame malignant nature: but I &s;hall de&s;cribe them in the Appendix. The&s;e Hawks-bill Turtles are better or wor&s;e, accor|ding
<PB N="104" REF="124">
to their feeding. In &s;ome places they feed on Gra&s;s, as the Green Tortoi&s;e al&s;o doth; in other places they keep among Rocks, and feed on Mo&s;s, or Sea-Weeds; but the&s;e are not &s;o &s;weet as tho&s;e that eat Gra&s;s, neither is their Shell &s;o clear, for they are commonly over-grown with Barnacles which &s;poils the &s;hell; and their Fle&s;h is commonly yellow, e&s;pecially the fat.</P>
<P>Hawks-bill Turtle are in many places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> They have I&s;lands and places peculiar to them&s;elves, where they lay their Eggs, and &s;eldom come among any other Turtle. The&s;e, and all other Turtle, lay Eggs in the Sand; their time of laying is in <HI>May, June, July.</HI> Some begin &s;ooner, &s;ome later. They lay three times in a Sea&s;on, and at each time 80 or 90 Eggs. Their Eggs are as big as a Hens Egg, and very round, covered only with a white tough &s;kin. There are &s;ome Bays on the North&s;ide of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the&s;e Hawks-bills re|&s;ort to lay. In the Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> are I&s;lands which they likewi&s;e make their breeding places, and many places along all the Coa&s;t on the Main of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> from <HI>Trinidado</HI> to <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Nova Hi&s;pania.</HI> When a Sea-turtle turns out of the Sea to lay, &s;he is at lea&s;t an hour before &s;he returns again; for &s;he is to go above high water-mark, and if it be low-water when &s;he comes a &s;hore, &s;he mu&s;t re&s;t once or twice, being heavy, before &s;he comes to the place where &s;he lays. When &s;he hath found a place for her purpo&s;e, &s;he makes a great hole with her Fins in the Sand, wherein &s;he lays her Eggs, then covers them two foot deep with the &s;ame Sand which &s;he threw out of the hole, and &s;o re|turns. Sometimes they come up the night before they intend to lay, and take a view of the place, and &s;o having made a Tour, or Semicircular March, they return to the Sea again, and they never fail to come a&s;hoar the next night to lay near that place.
<PB N="105" REF="125">
All &s;orts of Turtle u&s;e the &s;ame methods in laying. I knew a Man in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> that made 8 pound Ster|ling of the &s;hell of the&s;e Hawks-bill Turtle, which he got in one Sea&s;on, and in one &s;mall Bay, not half a mile long. The manner of taking them is to watch the Bay, by walking from one part to the other all night; making no noi&s;e, nor keeping any &s;ort of light. When the Turtle come a&s;hoar, the Man that watches for them turns them on their Backs, then hales them above high-water mark, and leave them till the Morning. A large green Turtle, with her weight and &s;truggling, will puzzle two Men to turn her. The Hawks-bill Turtle are not only found in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> I never &s;aw any in the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>The Green Turtle are &s;o called, becau&s;e their Shell is greener than any other. It is very thin and clear, and better clouded than the Hawks-bill; but 'tis u&s;ed only for inlays, being extraordinary thin. The&s;e Turtles are generally larger than the Hawks-bill; one will weigh 2 or 3 hundred pound. Their Backs are flatter than the Hawks-bill, their Heads round and &s;mall. Green Turtle are the &s;weete&s;t of all the kinds: But there are degrees of them, both in re|&s;pect to their Fle&s;h and their bigne&s;s. I have ob|&s;erved, that at <HI>Blanco</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Green Turtle (which is the only kind there) are larger than any other in the North-Seas. There they commonly will weigh 280 or 300 pound: Their Fat is yellow, and the Lean white, and their Fle&s;h extraordinary &s;weet. At <HI>Boca Toro,</HI> We&s;t of <HI>Portobel,</HI> they are not &s;o large, their Fle&s;h not &s;o white, nor the Fat &s;o yellow. Tho&s;e in the Bays of <HI>Honduras</HI> and <HI>Campeachy</HI> are &s;omewhat &s;maller &s;till; their Fat is green, and the Lean of a darker colour than tho&s;e at <HI>Boca-Toro.</HI> I heard of a mon&s;trous green Turtle once taken at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> that was four foot deep from the Back to the Belly,
<PB N="106" REF="126">
and the belly 6 foot broad; Captain <HI>Roch</HI>'s Son, of about 9 or 10 years of age, went in it as in a Boat, on board his Father's Ship, about a quarter of a mile from the &s;hore, The Leaves of Fat afforded 8 Gal|lons of Oil. The Turtle that live among the Keys, or &s;mall I&s;lands, on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Cuba,</HI> are a mix'd &s;ort, &s;ome bigger, &s;ome le&s;s; and &s;o their Fle&s;h is of a mix'd colour, &s;ome green, &s;ome dark, &s;ome yellowi&s;h. With the&s;e <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> is con&s;tantly &s;upplied, by Sloops that come hither with Nets to take them. They carry them alive to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the Turtles have Wires made with Stakes in the Sea to pre&s;erve them alive; and the Market is every day plentifully &s;tored with Turtle, it being the common food there, chiefly for the or|dinary &s;ort of People.</P>
<P>Green Turtle live on Gra&s;s, which grows in the Sea, in 3, 4, 5, or 6 fathom Water, at mo&s;t of the places before-mentioned. This Gra&s;s is different from Manatee-gra&s;s, for that is a &s;mall Blade; but this a quarter of an inch broad, and &s;ix inches long. The Turtle of the&s;e I&s;lands <HI>Gallapagos,</HI> are a &s;ort of a ba&s;tard green Turtle, for their Shell is thicker than other green Turtle in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and their Fle&s;h is not &s;o &s;weet. They are larger than any other green Turtle; for it is common for the&s;e to be two or three foot deep, and their Callapees, or Bellies, 5 foot wide: but there are other green Tur|tle in the <HI>South-Seas</HI> that are not &s;o big as the &s;mal|le&s;t Hawks-bill. The&s;e are &s;een at the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> and other places thereabouts: They feed on Mo&s;s, and are very rank, but fat.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e &s;orts are different from any others, for both He's and She's come a&s;hoar in the day time, and lie in the Sun; but in other places, none but the She's go a&s;hoar, and that in the night only, to lay their Eggs. The be&s;t feeding for Turtle in the South Seas is among the&s;e <HI>Gallapago</HI> I&s;lands, for here is plenty of Gra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="127">
There is another &s;ort of green Turtle in the <HI>South Seas</HI> which are but &s;mall, yet pretty &s;weet: The&s;e lie We&s;tward on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico.</HI> One thing is very &s;trange and remarkable in the&s;e Crea|tures; that at the breeding time they leave for 2 or 3 Months their common Haunts, where they feed mo&s;t of the Year, and re&s;ort to other places, only to lay their Eggs: and 'tis not thought that they eat any thing during this Sea&s;on: So that both He's and She's grow very lean; but the He's to that de|gree that none will eat them. The mo&s;t remarka|ble places that I did ever hear of for their breeding, is at an I&s;land in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> called <HI>Caimanes,</HI> and the I&s;le <HI>A&s;cention</HI> in the <HI>We&s;tern Ocean:</HI> and when the breeding time is pa&s;t, there are none remaining. Doubtle&s;s they &s;wim &s;ome hundreds of Leagues to come to tho&s;e two places: For it hath been often ob&s;erved, that at <HI>Caimanes,</HI> at the breeding time, there are found all tho&s;e &s;orts of Turtle before de|&s;cribed. The <HI>South Keys</HI> of <HI>Cuba</HI> are above 40 leagues from thence, which is the neare&s;t place that the&s;e Creatures can come from; and it is mo&s;t certain, that there could not live &s;o many there as come here in one Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that go to lay at <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> mu&s;t needs tra|vel much farther, for there is no Land nearer it than 300 Leagues: And it is certain, that the&s;e Crea|tures live always near the Shoar. In the <HI>South Sea</HI> likewi&s;e, the <HI>Gallapagos</HI> is the place where they live the bigge&s;t part of the year; yet they go from thence at their Sea&s;on over to the Main, to lay their Eggs; which is 100 Leagues, the neare&s;t place. Altho' multitudes of the&s;e Turtle go from their common places of feeding and abode, to tho&s;e laying places, yet they do not all go: And at the time when the Turtle re&s;ort to the&s;e places to lay their Eggs, they are accompanied with abundance of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Sharks; the places which the Turtle then leave be|ing
<PB N="108" REF="128">
at that time de&s;titute of Fi&s;h, which follow the Turtle.</P>
<P>When the She's go thus to their places to lay, the Male accompany them, and never leave them till their return; both Male and Female are fat the be|ginning of the Sea&s;on; but before they return, the Male, as I &s;aid, are &s;o lean, that they are not fit to eat, but the Female are good to the very la&s;t; yet not &s;o fat as at the beginning of the Sea&s;on. It is reported of the&s;e Creatures, that they are nine days engendring, and in the Water; the Male on the Females Back. It is ob&s;ervable, that the Male, while engendring, do not ea&s;ily for&s;ake their Fe|male: for I have gone and taken hold of the Male when engendring: and a very bad Striker may &s;trike them then, for the Male is not &s;hy at all: but the Female &s;eeing a Boat, when they ri&s;e to blow, would make her e&s;cape, but that the Male gra&s;ps her with his two fore Fins, and holds her fa&s;t. When they are thus coupled, it is be&s;t to &s;trike the Female fir&s;t, then you are &s;ure of the Male al&s;o. The&s;e Creatures are thought to live to a great Age; and it is ob&s;erved by the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Turtlers, that they are many years before they come to their full growth.</P>
<P>The Air of the&s;e I&s;lands is temperate enough, con|&s;idering the Clime. Here is con&s;tantly a fre&s;h Sea|breeze all day, and cooling refre&s;hing Winds in the night: Therefore the heat is not &s;o violent here, as in mo&s;t places near the Equator. The time of the year for the Rains is in <HI>November, December</HI> and <HI>January:</HI> Then there is oftentimes exce&s;&s;ive dark tempe&s;tuous Weather, mixt with much Thunder and Lightning. Sometimes before and after the&s;e Months there are moderate refre&s;hing Showers; but in <HI>May, June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Weather is al|ways very fair.</P>
<P>We &s;taid at one of the&s;e I&s;lands, which lies under the Equator, but one Night, becau&s;e our Prizes
<PB N="109" REF="129">
could not get in to an Anchor. We refre&s;h'd our &s;elves very well, both with Land and Sea-Turtles; and the next day we &s;ailed from thence. The next I&s;land of the <HI>Gallapagos</HI> that we came to, is but two Leagues from this: 'tis rocky and barren like this: it is about five or &s;ix Leagues long, and four broad. We anchored in the Afternoon, at the North-&s;ide of the I&s;land, a quarter of a Mile from the Shore, in 16 fathom Water. It is &s;teep all round this I&s;land, and no Anchoring, only at this place. Here it is but ordinary riding; for the Ground is &s;o &s;teep, that if an Anchor &s;tarts it never holds again; and the Wind is commonly off from the Land, except in the Night, when the Land-wind comes more from the We&s;t; for there it blows right along the Shore, though but faintly. Here is no Water but in Ponds and Holes of the Rocks. That which we fir&s;t an|chored at hath Water on the North-end; falling down in a &s;tream from high &s;teep Rocks, upon the Sandy Bay, where it may be taken up. As &s;oon as we came to an Anchor, we made a Tent a&s;hoar for Capt. <HI>Cook,</HI> who was &s;ick. Here we found the Sea-Turtle lying a&s;hoar on the Sand; this is not cu&s;to|mary in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> We turned them on their Backs that they might not get away. The next day more came up, when we found it to be their cu&s;tom to lie in the Sun: &s;o we never took care to turn them afterwards; but &s;ent a&s;hoar the Cook every Morning, who killed as many as &s;erved for the day. This cu&s;tom we ob&s;erved all the time we lay here, feeding &s;ometimes on Land-Turtle, &s;ometimes on Sea-Turtle, there being plenty of either &s;ort. Cap|tain <HI>Davis</HI> came hither again a &s;econd time; and then he went to other I&s;lands on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the&s;e. There he found &s;uch plenty of Land-Turtle, that he and his Men eat nothing el&s;e for 3 Months that he &s;taid there. They were &s;o fat, that he &s;aved &s;ixty Jars of Oyl out of tho&s;e that he &s;pent: This
<PB N="110" REF="130">
Oil &s;erved in&s;tead of Butter, to eat with Dough|boys or Dumplins, in his return out of the&s;e Seas. He found very convenient places to Careen, and good Channels between the I&s;lands; and very good Anchoring in many places. There he found al&s;o plenty of Brooks of good fre&s;h Water, and Fire|wood enough, there being plenty of Trees fit for many u&s;es. Capt. <HI>Harris,</HI> one that we &s;hall &s;peak of hereafter, came hither likewi&s;e, and found &s;ome I&s;lands that had plenty of <HI>Mammee-Trees,</HI> and pretty large Rivers. The Sea about the&s;e I&s;lands is plenti|fully &s;tored with Fi&s;h, &s;uch as are at <HI>John Fernando</HI>'s. They are both large and fat, and as plentiful here as at <HI>John Fernando</HI>'s. Here are particularly abun|dance of Sharks. The North-part of this &s;econd I&s;le we anchored at, lies 28 minutes North of the <HI>Equa|tor.</HI> I took the heighth of the Sun with an <HI>A&s;trolabe.</HI> The&s;e I&s;les of the <HI>Gallapago's</HI> have plenty of Salt. We &s;tay'd here but 12 days, in which time we put a&s;hoar 5000 packs of Flower, for a re&s;erve, if we &s;hould have occa&s;ion of any before we left the&s;e Seas. Here one of our <HI>Indian</HI> Pri&s;oners informed us that he was born at <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> and that he would en|gage to carry us thither. He being examin'd of the Strength and Riches of it, &s;atisfy'd the Company &s;o well, that they were re&s;olved to go thither.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, the 12th of <HI>June</HI> we &s;ailed from hence, de&s;igning to touch at the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> as well to put a&s;hoar &s;ome Flower there, as to &s;ee the I&s;land, becau&s;e it was in our way to <HI>Ria Lexa.</HI> We &s;teer'd North, till in Lat. 4 d. 40 min. intend|ing then to &s;teer W. by N. for we expected to have had the Wind at S. by E. or S. S. E. as we had on the South-&s;ide of the Equator. Thus I had for|merly found the Winds near the Shore in the&s;e Lati|tudes; but when we fir&s;t parted from the <HI>Gallapago's,</HI> we had the Wind at S. and as we &s;ailed farther North, we had the Winds at S. by W. then at
<PB N="111" REF="131">
S. S. W. Winds which we did not expect. We thought at fir&s;t that the Wind would come about again to the South; but when we came to &s;ail off We&s;t to the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> we had the Wind at S. W. by S. and could lie but W. by N. Yet we &s;tood that Cour&s;e till we were in the lat. 5 d. 40 m. N. and then de&s;pairing, as the Winds were, to find the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> we &s;teer'd over to the Main; for had we &s;een the I&s;land then, we could not have fetcht it, being &s;o far to the North of it.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Cocos</HI> is &s;o named by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> be|cau&s;e there are abundance of Coco-nut Trees grow|ing on it. They are not only in one or two places, but grow in great Groves, all round the I&s;land, by the Sea. This is an uninhabited I&s;land, it is 7 or 8 leagues round, and pretty high in the middle, where it is de&s;titute of Trees, but looks very green and plea&s;ant, with an Herb called by the <HI>Spaniards Gra|madael.</HI> It is low Land by the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is in 5 d. 15 m. North of the Equator; it is invironed with Rocks, which makes it almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible: only at the N. E. end there is a &s;mall Harbor where Ships may &s;afely enter and ride &s;ecure. In this Harbor there is a fine Brook of fre&s;h Water running into the Sea. This is the account that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give of it, and I had the &s;ame al&s;o from Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> who was there afterward.</P>
<P>Any who, like us, had not experienced the nature of the Winds in the&s;e parts, might rea&s;onably expect that we could have &s;ailed with a flown Sheet to <HI>Ria Lexa;</HI> but we found our &s;elves mi&s;taken, for as we came nearer the &s;hore, we found the Winds right in our Teeth: But I &s;hall refer my Reader to the Chap|ter of Winds in the Appendix, for a further account of this.</P>
<P>We had very fair weather, and &s;mall winds, in this Voyage from the <HI>Gallapagos,</HI> and at the beginning of <HI>July</HI> we fell in with Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> on the Main of
<PB N="112" REF="132">
<HI>Mexico.</HI> This is &s;o called from two white Rocks ly|ing off it. When weare off at Sea, right again&s;t the Cape, they appear as part of the Cape; but being near the &s;hoar, either to the Ea&s;tward or We&s;t-ward of the Cape, they appear like two Ships under &s;ail at fir&s;t view, but coming nearer, they are like two high Towers; they being &s;mall, high, and &s;teep on all &s;ides, and they are about half a mile from the Cape. This Cape is in lat. 9 d. 56 m. It is about the heighth of <HI>Beachy-head</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> It is a full Point, with &s;teep Rocks to the Sea. The top of it is flat and even for about a mile: then it gradually falls away on each &s;ide with a gentle de&s;cent. It appears very plea&s;ant, being co|vered with great lofty Trees. From the Cape on the N. W. &s;ide the Land runs in N. E. for about 4 leagues, making a &s;mall Bay called by the <HI>Spaniards Caldera.</HI> A league within Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> on the N. W. &s;ide of it, and at the entrance of this Bay, there is a &s;mall Brook of very good water running into the Sea. Here the Land is low, making a &s;addling between 2 &s;mall Hills. It is very rich Land; producing large tall Trees of many &s;orts; the Mould is black and deep, which I have always taken notice of to be a fat Soil. About a mile from this Brook, towards the N. E. the Woodland terminates. Here the Savan|nah Land begins, and runs &s;ome Leagues into the Country, making many &s;mall Hills and Dales. The&s;e Savannahs are not altogether clear of Trees, but are here and there &s;prinkled with &s;mall Groves, which render them very delightful. The Gra&s;s which grows here is very kindly, thick, and long; I have &s;een none better in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Toward the bottom of the Bay, the Land by the Sea is low and full of Mangroves, but farther in the Country the Land is high and mountainous. The Mountains are part Woodland, part Savannah. The Trees in tho&s;e Woods are but &s;mall and &s;hort; and the
<PB N="113" REF="133">
Mountain Savannahs are cloathed but with indiffe|rent Gra&s;s. From the bottom of this Bay, it is but 14 or 15 leagues, to the Lake of <HI>Nicaragua</HI> on the North-Sea Coa&s;t: the way between is &s;omewhat Mountainous, but mo&s;t Savannah.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Cook,</HI> who was taken &s;ick at <HI>John Fernan|doe</HI>'s, continued &s;o till we came within 2 or 3 leagues of Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> and then died of a &s;udden; tho' he &s;eemed that morning to be as likely to live, as he had been &s;ome weeks before; but it is u&s;ual with &s;ick Men coming from the Sea, where they have nothing but the Sea-Air, to die off as &s;oon as ever they come within the view of the Land. About 4 hours after we all came to an Anchor, (namely the Ship that I was in, Captain <HI>Eaton,</HI> and the great Meal Prize,) a league within the Cape, right a|gain&s;t the Brook of Fre&s;h-water, in 14 fathom clean hard Sand. Pre&s;ently after we came to an Anchor, Capt. <HI>Cook</HI> was carried a&s;hoar to be buried; 12 Men carried there Arms to Guard tho&s;e that were ordered to dig the Grave: for although we &s;aw no appearance of Inhabitants, yet we did not know but the Country might be thick inhabited. And before Capt. <HI>Cook</HI> was interr'd, 3 <HI>Spani&s;h Indians</HI> came to the place where our Men were digging the Grave, and demanded what they were, and from whence they came? to whom our Men an|&s;wered, They came from <HI>Lima,</HI> and were bound to <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> but that the Capt. of one of the Ships dying at Sea, oblig'd them to come into this place to give him Chri&s;tian burial. The 3 <HI>Spani&s;h Indians,</HI> who were very &s;hy at fir&s;t, began to be more bold, and drawing nearer, asked many &s;illy Que&s;tions; and our Men did not &s;tick to &s;ooth them up with as many Fal&s;hoods, purpo&s;ely to draw them into their clutches. Our Men often laught at their temerity; and asked them if they never &s;aw any <HI>Spaniards</HI> be|fore? They told them, that they them&s;elves were
<PB N="114" REF="134">
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that they lived among <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that altho' they were born there, yet they had never &s;een 3 Ships there before: Our Men told them, that neither now might they have &s;een &s;o many, if it had not been on an urgent occa&s;ion. At length they drill'd them by di&s;cour&s;e &s;o near, that our Men lay'd hold on all three at once; but before Captain <HI>Cook</HI> was buried, one of them made his e&s;cape, the other two were brought off aboard our Ship. Cap|tain <HI>Eaton</HI> immediately came aboard and examined them; they confe&s;&s;ed that they came purpo&s;ely to view our Ship, and if po&s;&s;ible to inform them&s;elves what we were; for the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama</HI> not long before, &s;ent a Letter of advice to <HI>Nicoya,</HI> in|forming the Magi&s;trates thereof, that &s;ome Enemies were come into the&s;e Seas, and that therefore it behoved them to be careful of them&s;elves. <HI>Nicoya</HI> is a &s;mall Mulatto Town, about 12 or 14 leagues Ea&s;t from hence, &s;tanding on the Banks of a River of that name. It is a place very fit for building Ships, therefore mo&s;t of the Inhabitants are Carpenters; who are commonly imployed in building new, or repairing old Ships. It was here that Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI> (ju&s;t after I left him, in the Year 1681.) got Car|penters to &s;ix his Ship, before he returned for <HI>Eng|land:</HI> and for that rea&s;on it behoved the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be careful, (according to the Governor of <HI>Panama</HI>'s advice,) le&s;t any Men at other times wanting &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as that place afforded, might again be &s;upplied there. The&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h Indians</HI> told us likewi&s;e, that they were &s;ent to the place where they were taken, in order to view our Ships, as fearing the&s;e were tho&s;e mentioned by the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama:</HI> It being demanded of them to give an account of the E&s;tate and Riches of the Country, they &s;aid that the Inhabitants were mo&s;t Hu&s;bandmen, who were imployed either in Planting and Manuring of Corn, or chiefly about Cattle; they having large Savan|nahs,
<PB N="115" REF="135">
which were well &s;tored with Bulls, Cows and Hor&s;es; that by the Sea-&s;ide, in &s;ome places there grew &s;ome Red-wood, u&s;eful in Dying; of this they &s;aid there was little profit made, becau&s;e they were forc'd to &s;end it to the Lake of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> which runs into the North Seas: That they &s;ent thither al&s;o great quantities of Bull and Cow Hides, and brought from thence in Exchange <HI>Europe</HI> Com|modities; as Hats, Linnen and Wollen, where|with they cloathed them&s;elves; that the Fle&s;h of the Cattle turned to no other profit than Su&s;tenance for their Families: As for Butter and Chee&s;e they make but little in tho&s;e parts. After they had gi|ven this Relation, they told us, that if we wanted Provi&s;ion, there was a Beef-E&s;tantion, or Farm of Bulls or Cows about 3 mile off, where we might kill what we plea&s;ed. This was welcome News, for we had no &s;ort of Fle&s;h &s;ince we left the <HI>Gallapagos;</HI> therefore 24 of us immediately entered into two Boats, taking one of the&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h Indians</HI> with us for a Pilot, and went a&s;hore about a league from the Ship. There we haled up our Boats dry, and marched all away, following our Guide, who &s;oon brought us to &s;ome Hou&s;es, and a large Penn for Cattle. This Penn &s;tood in a large Savannah, about two Mile from our Boats: There were a great many fat Bulls and Cows feeding in the Savannahs; &s;ome of us would have kill'd 3 or 4 to carry on board, but others oppo&s;ed it, and &s;aid, It was better to &s;tay all Night, and in the Morning drive the Cattle into the Penn, and then kill 20 or 30, or as many as we plea&s;ed. I was minded to return aboard, and endeavoured to per&s;wade them all to go with me, but &s;ome would not, therefore I returned with 12, which was half, and left the other 12 behind. At this place I &s;aw 3 or 4 Tun of the Red-wood; which I take to be that &s;ort of Wood, call'd in <HI>Ja|maica</HI> Blood-wood, or <HI>Nicaragua-wood.</HI> We who
<PB N="116" REF="136">
returned abroad, met no one to oppo&s;e us, and the next day we expected our Con&s;orts that we left a|&s;hore, but none came; therefore at 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, 10 Men went in our Canoa to &s;ee what was become of them: When they came to the Bay where we landed, to go to the E&s;tantion, they found our Men all on a &s;mall Rock, half a mile from the &s;hore, &s;tanding in the Water up to their Wa&s;tes. The&s;e Men had &s;lept a&s;hore in the Hou&s;e and turned out betimes in the Morning to pen the Cattle: 2 or 3 went one way, and as many another way, to get the Cattle to the Pen, and others &s;tood at the Pen to drive them in. When they were thus &s;catter'd, about 40 or 50 armed <HI>Spaniards</HI> came in among them: Our Men immediately called to each other, and drew together in a Body before the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> could attack them; and marched to their Boat, which was hal'd up dry on the Sand. But when they came to the &s;andy Bay, they found their Boat all in Flames. This was a very unplea&s;ing &s;ight, for they knew not how to get Aboard, unle&s;s they marched by Land to the place where Capt. <HI>Cook</HI> was buried, which was near a league. The greate&s;t part of the way was thick Woods, where the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> might ea&s;ily lay an Ambu&s;h for them, at which they are very expert. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> now thought them &s;ecure; and therefore came to them, and asked them if they would be plea&s;ed to walk to their Plantations, with many other &s;uch flouts; but our Men an&s;wered never a word. It was about half ebb, when one of our Men took no|tice of a Rock a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, ju&s;t appearing above Water; he &s;hewed it to his Con|&s;orts, and told them it would be a good Ca&s;tle for them if they could get thither. They all wi&s;ht them&s;elves there; for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who lay as yet at a good di&s;tance from them behind the Bu&s;hes, as &s;ecure of their Prey, began to whi&s;tle now and then
<PB N="117" REF="137">
a &s;hot among them. Having therefore well con&s;i|dered the place, together with the danger they were in, they propo&s;ed to &s;end one of the talle&s;t Men to try if the Sea between them and the Rock were fordable. This Coun&s;el they pre&s;ently put in execu|tion, and found it according to their de&s;ire. So they all marched over to the Rock, where they remained till the Canoa came to them; which was about 7 Hours. It was the latter part of the Ebb when they fir&s;t went over, and then the Rock was dry; but when the Tide of Flood returned again, the Rock was covered, and the Water &s;till flowing; &s;o that if our Canoa had &s;tayed but one hour longer, they might have been in as great danger of their lives from the Sea, as before from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for the Tide ri&s;eth here about 8 foot. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> remained on the &s;hore, expecting to &s;ee them de|&s;troyed, but never came from behind the Bu&s;hes, where they fir&s;t planted them&s;elves; they having not above 3 or 4 Hand-guns, the re&s;t of them being armed with Lances. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the&s;e parts are very expert in heaving or darting the Lance; with which, upon occa&s;ion, they will do great Feats, e&s;pecially in Ambu&s;cades: And by their good Will, they care not for fighting otherwi&s;e, but content them&s;elves with &s;tanding a loof, threatning and cal|ling Names, at which they are as expert as the other; &s;o that if their Tongues be quiet, we always take it for granted they have &s;aid &s;ome Ambu&s;h. Before night our Canoa came Aboard, and brought our Men all &s;afe. The next day two Canoas were &s;ent to the bottom of the Bay to &s;eek &s;or a large Canoa, which we were informed was there. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have neither Ships nor Barks here, and but a few Canoas which they &s;eldom u&s;e: Neither are there any Fi&s;hermen here, as I judge, becau&s;e Fi&s;h is very &s;carce; for I never &s;aw any here, neither could any of our Men ever take any; and yet where-ever
<PB N="118" REF="138">
we come to an Anchor, we always &s;end out our Strikers, and put our Hooks and Lines over|board, to try for Fi&s;h. The next day our Men re|turned out of the Bay, and brought the Canoa with them, which they were &s;ent for, and 3 or 4 days afterwards the 2 Canoas were &s;ent out again for ano|ther, which they likewi&s;e brought aboard. The&s;e Canoas were fitted with Thoats or Benhces, Straps and Oars, fit for &s;ervice; and one of the&s;e Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> had for his &s;hare, and we the other, which we &s;ixt for landing Men when occa&s;ion required. While we lay here, we filled our Water, and cut a great many Looms, or Handles, or Staves for Oars; for here is plenty of Lance-wood, which is mo&s;t proper for that u&s;e. I never &s;aw any in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> but in this place: There is plenty of it in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> e&s;pe|cially at a place called <HI>Blewfields</HI> (not <HI>Blewfields</HI> Ri|ver which is on the Main) near the We&s;t-end of that I&s;land. The Lance-wood grows &s;trait like our young A&s;hes; it is very hard, tough and heavy, therefore Privateers e&s;teem it very much, not only to make Looms for Oars, but Scouring-Rods for their Guns; for they have &s;eldom le&s;s than 3 or 4 &s;pare Rods for fear one &s;hould break, and they are much better than Rods made of A&s;h.</P>
<P>The Day before we went from hence, Mr. <HI>Edward Davis,</HI> the Company's Quarter-Ma&s;ter, was made Captain by con&s;ent of all the Company; for it was his place by Succe&s;&s;ion. The 20th day of <HI>July</HI> we &s;ailed from this Bay of <HI>Caldera,</HI> with Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> and our Prize which we brought from <HI>Gallapagos</HI> in Company, directing our Cour&s;e for <HI>Ria Lexa.</HI> The Wind was at North, which altho' but an ordinary Wind, yet carried us in three days abre&s;t of our in|tended Port.</P>
<P><HI>Ria Lexa</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable Land on all this Coa&s;t, for there is a high pecked burning Moun|tain, called by the Spaniards <HI>Volcan-Vejo,</HI> or the <HI>Old</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="139">
<HI>Volcan.</HI> This mu&s;t be brought to bear N. E. then &s;teer in directly with the Mountain, and that cour&s;e will bring you to the Harbour. The Sea winds are here at S. S. W. therefore Ships that come hither mu&s;t take the Sea-winds, for there is no going in with the Land-wind. The <HI>Volcan</HI> may be ea&s;ily known, becau&s;e there is not any other &s;o high a Mountain near it, neither is there any that appears in the like form all along the Coa&s;t; be&s;ides it &s;moaks all the day, and in the night it &s;ometimes &s;ends forth flames of Fire. This Mountain may be &s;een 20 leagues: being within 3 leagues of the Harbor, the entrance into it may be &s;een; there is a &s;mall flat low I&s;land which makes the Harbor, it is about a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad, and is from the Main about a mile and a half. There is a Channel at each end of the I&s;land, the we&s;t Channel is the wide&s;t and &s;afe&s;t, yet at the N. W. point of the I&s;land there is a &s;hole which Ships mu&s;t take heed of going in. Being pa&s;t that &s;hole, you mu&s;t keep clo&s;e to the I&s;land, for there is a whole &s;andy point &s;trikes over from the Main almo&s;t half way. The Ea&s;t Channel is not &s;o wide, be&s;ides there runs a &s;tronger Tide; therefore Ships &s;eldom or never go in that way. This Harbor is capable of recei|ving 200 Sail of Ships; the be&s;t riding is near the Main, where there is 7 or 8 fathom water, clean hard Sand.</P>
<P><HI>Ria Lexa</HI> Town is 2 leagues from hence, and there are 2 Creeks that run towards it; the We&s;ter|mo&s;t comes near the back&s;ide of the Town, the o|ther runs up to the Town, but neither Ships nor Barks can go &s;o far. The&s;e Creeks are very narrow, and the Land on each &s;ide drowned and full of red Mangrove-trees. About a mile and half below the Town, on the banks of the Ea&s;t Creek, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> had ca&s;t up a &s;trong Brea&s;t-work; it was like|wi&s;e reported they had another on the We&s;t Creek,

both &s;o advantageou&s;ly placed, that 10 Men might with ea&s;e keep 200 Men from landing. I &s;hall give a de&s;cription of the Town in my return hither, and therefore forbear to do it here. Wherefore to re&s;ume the thread of our cour&s;e, we were now in &s;ight of the <HI>Volcan,</HI> being by e&s;timation 7 or 8 leagues from the &s;hoar, and the Mountain bearing N. E. we took in our Top&s;ails and hal'd up our Cour&s;es, intending to go with our Canoas into the Harbor in the night. In the Evening we had a very hard Tornado, out of the N. E. with much Thunder, Lightning and Rain. The violence of the Wind did not la&s;t long, yet it was a 11 a clock at night before we got out our Canoas, and then it was quite calm. We rowed in directly for the &s;hoar, and thought to have reach'd it before day, but it was 9 a Clock in the Morning before we got into the Harbor. When we came with|in a league of the I&s;land of <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> that makes the Harbor, we &s;aw a Hou&s;e on it, and coming nearer we &s;aw 2 or 3 Men, who &s;tood and looked on us till we came within half a mile of the I&s;land, then they went into their Canoa, which lay on the in|&s;ide of the I&s;land, and rowed towards the Main; but we overtook them before they got over, and brought them back again to the I&s;land. There was a Hor&s;eman right again&s;t us on the Main when we took the Canoa, who immediately rode away towards the Town as fa&s;t as he could. The re&s;t of our Canoas rowed heavily, and did not come to the I&s;land till 12 a clock, therefore we were forced to &s;tay for them. Before they came we examined the Pri&s;oners, who told us, that they were &s;et there to watch; for the Governor of <HI>Ria Lexa</HI> received a Letter about a month before, wherein he was advi&s;ed of &s;ome Enemies come into the Sea, and therefore admo|ni&s;hed to be careful; that, immediately there|upon the Governor had cau&s;ed a Hou&s;e to be built on this I&s;land, and ordered 4 Men to be continually

At fir&s;t they took us in our advanced Canoa to be &s;ome Men that had been ca&s;t away and lo&s;t our Ship; till &s;eeing 3 or 4 Canoas more, they began to &s;u&s;pect what we were.

<P>There is a fine Spring of fre&s;h Water on the I&s;land, there are &s;ome Trees al&s;o, but the bigge&s;t part is Savannah, whereon is good Gra&s;s, though there is no &s;ort of Bea&s;t to eat it.

<P>The 26th of <HI>July</HI> Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> came aboard our Ship, to con&s;ult with Captain <HI>Davis,</HI> how to get &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in careening: It was con|cluded, that when we came near the Gulf, Captain <HI>Davis</HI> &s;hould take two Canoas, well mann'd, and go before, and Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> &s;hould &s;tay aboard. According to this Agreement, Captain <HI>Davis</HI> went away for the Gulf the next day.</P>
<P>The Gulf of <HI>Amapalla</HI> is a great Arm of the Sea, running 8 or 10 Leagues into the Country. It is bounded on the South-&s;ide of its Entrance with

<PB N="122" REF="144">
Point <HI>Ca&s;ivina,</HI> and on the N. W. &s;ide with St. <HI>Mi|chael</HI>'s Mount. Both the&s;e place are very remarka|ble: Point <HI>Ca&s;ivina</HI> is in lat. 12 d. 40 m. North: it is a high round Point, which at Sea appears like an I&s;land; becau&s;e the Land within it is very low. St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Mount is a very high peeked Hill, not very &s;teep: the Land at the foot of it on the S. E. &s;ide, is low and even, for at lea&s;t a mile. From this low Land the Gulf of <HI>Amapalla</HI> enters on that &s;ide. Between this low Land and Point <HI>Ca&s;ivina,</HI> there are two con&s;iderable high I&s;lands; the South|ermo&s;t is called <HI>Mangera,</HI> the other is called <HI>Ama|palla,</HI> and they are two miles a&s;under.</P>
<P><HI>Mangera</HI> is a high round I&s;land, about 2 leagues in compa&s;s, appearing like a tall Grove. It is in|vironed with Rocks all round, only a &s;mall Cove, or &s;andy Bay on the N. E. &s;ide. The Mold and Soil of this I&s;land is black, but not deep; it is mixt with Stones, yet very productive of large tall Tim|ber Trees. In the middle of the I&s;land there is an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, and a fair <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Church. The <HI>In|dians</HI> have Plantations of Maiz round the Town and &s;ome Plantains: They have a few Cocks and Hens, but no other &s;ort of tame Fowl; neithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> have they any &s;ort of Bea&s;t, but Cats and Dogs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> There is a path from the Town to the &s;andy Bay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the way is &s;teep and rocky.

The other Town is not &s;o big, yet it has a good hand&s;om Church. One thing I have ob&s;erved in all the <HI>Indians</HI> Towns under the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government, as well in the&s;e parts as in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, that the Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and other Saints, (with which all their Churches were filled) are &s;till painted in an <HI>Indian</HI> Complexion, and partly in that Dre&s;s; but in tho&s;e Towns which are inhabited chiefly by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Saints al&s;o con|form them&s;elves to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garb and Complexion. The Hou&s;es here are but mean; the <HI>Indians</HI> of both Plains have good Field Maiz, remote from the Town: they have but few Plantains, but they have abundance of large Hog-Plumb-trees, growing about their Hou&s;es. The Tree that bears this Fruit is as big as our large&s;t Plumb-tree: The Leaf is of a dark green colour, and as broad as the Leaf of a Plumb-tree; but they are &s;haped like the Haw-thorn Leaf. The Trees are very brittle Wood. The Fruit is oval, and as big as a &s;mall Hor&s;e Plumb. It is at fir&s;t very green, but when it is ripe, one &s;ide is yellow, the other red. It hath a great &s;tone, and but little &s;ub&s;tance about it: The Fruit is plea&s;ant enough; but I do not remember that ever I &s;aw one through|ly ripe, that had not a Maggot or two in it. I do not remember that I did ever &s;ee any of this Fruit in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> but at this place. In the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> they are very plentiful, and in <HI>Jamaica</HI> they plant them to fence their Ground. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> have al&s;o &s;ome Fowls, as tho&s;e at <HI>Mangera:</HI> No <HI>Spaniards</HI> dwell among them, but only one <HI>Padre</HI> or Prie&s;t, who &s;erves for all three Town; the&s;e two at <HI>Amapalla,</HI> and that at <HI>Mangera.</HI> They are under the Governour of the Town of St. <HI>Mi|chael</HI>'s at the foot of St. <HI>Michael</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Mount, to whom they pay their Tribute in Maiz; being extreamly poor, yet very contented. They have nothing to make Money of, but their Plantations of Maiz and

their Fowls; the <HI>Padre</HI> or Fryer hath his Tenths of it, and knows to a Peck how much every Man hath, and how many Fowls, of which they dare not kill one, tho' they are &s;ick, without leave from him. There was (as I &s;aid) never another white Man on the&s;e I&s;lands, but the Fryer. He could &s;peak the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, as all Fryers mu&s;t that live among them. In this va&s;t Country of <HI>America</HI> there are di|vers Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> different in their Language, therefore tho&s;e Fryers that are minded to live among any Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> mu&s;t learn the Language of tho&s;e People they propo&s;e to teach. Although the&s;e here are but poor, yet the <HI>Indians</HI> in many other places have great Riches, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> draw from them for Trifles: In &s;uch places the Fry|ers get plentiful Incoms; as particularly in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> have large Cacao|walks; or in other Places where they plant Cocho|neel Trees, or Silve&s;ter-Trees; or where they gather Vinelloes, and in &s;uch places where they gather Gold. In &s;uch places as the&s;e, the Fryers do get a great deal of Wealth. There was but one of all the <HI>Indians</HI> on both the&s;e I&s;lands that could &s;peak <HI>Spa|ni&s;h;</HI> he could write <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> al&s;o, being bred up pur|po&s;ely to keep their Regi&s;ters and Books of Account: He was Secretary to both I&s;lands. They had a <HI>Co&s;ica</HI> too, (a &s;mall &s;ort of Magi&s;trate the <HI>Indians</HI> have a|mong&s;t them&s;elves) but he could neither write nor &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many more I&s;lands in this Bay, but none inhabited as the&s;e. There is one pretty large I&s;land, belonging to a Nunnery, as the <HI>Indians</HI> told us, this was &s;tocked with Bulls and Cows, there were 3 or 4 <HI>Indians</HI> lived there to look after the Cattle, for the &s;ake of which we often fre|quented this I&s;land, while we lay in the Bay; they are all low I&s;lands, except <HI>Amapalla</HI> and <HI>Mangera.</HI> There are two Channels to come into this Gulph,
<PB N="125" REF="147">
one between Point <HI>Ca&s;ivina</HI> and <HI>Mangera,</HI> the other between <HI>Mangera</HI> and <HI>Amapalla:</HI> The latter is the be&s;t. The Riding place is on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Ama|palla,</HI> right again&s;t a &s;pot of low Ground; for all the I&s;land except this one place is high Land. Run|ning in farther, Ships may anchor near the Main, on the N. E. &s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Amapalla.</HI> This is the place mo&s;t frequented by <HI>Spaniards:</HI> It is called the Port of <HI>Martin Lopez.</HI> This Gulph or Lake runs in &s;ome Leagues beyond all the I&s;lands; but it is &s;hole Water, and not capable of Ships.</P>
<P>It was into this Gulph that Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> was gone with the two Canoas, to endeavour for a Pri&s;oner, to gain intelligence, if po&s;&s;ible, before our Ships came in: He came the fir&s;t Night to <HI>Mangera,</HI> but for want of a Pilot, did not know where to look for the Town. In the Morning he found a great many Canoas haled up on the Bay; and from that Bay found a Path which led him and his Company to the Town. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aw our Ships in the Evening coming towards the I&s;land, and being before inform|ed of Enemies in the Sea, they kept Scouts out all Night for fear; who &s;eeing Captain <HI>Davis</HI> coming, run into the Town, and alarmed all the People. When Captain <HI>Davis</HI> came thither, they all run in|to the Woods. The Fryer happened to be there at this time; who being unable to ramble into the Woods, fell into Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s Hands: There were two <HI>Indian</HI> Boys with him, who were likewi&s;e ta|ken. Captain <HI>Davis</HI> went only to get a Pri&s;oner, therefore was well &s;atisfied with the Fryer, and im|mediately came down to the Sea-&s;ide. He went from thence to the I&s;land <HI>Amapalla,</HI> carrying the Fryer and the two <HI>Indian</HI> Boys with him. The&s;e were his Pilots to conduct him to the Landing place, where they arrived about Noon. They made no &s;tay here, but left 3 or 4 Men to look after the Canoas, and Captain <HI>Davis</HI> with the re&s;t marched to
<PB N="126" REF="148">
the Town, taking the Fryer with them. The Town, as is before noted, is about a Mile from the Land|ing-place, &s;tanding in a Plain on the top of a Hill, having a very &s;teep a&s;cent to go to it. All the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tood on the top of the Hill waiting Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s coming.</P>
<P>The Secretary, mention'd before, had no great kindne&s;s for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> It was he that per&s;waded the <HI>Indians</HI> to wait Captain <HI>Davis</HI> his coming; for they were all running into the Woods; but he told them, that if any of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Enemies came thither, it was not to hurt them, but the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who&s;e Slaves they were; and that their Poverty would protect them. This Man with the <HI>Ca&s;ica</HI> &s;tood more forward than the re&s;t, at the Bank of the Hill, when Captain <HI>Davis</HI> with his Company appeared beneath.

all publick Meetings, and all Plays and Pa&s;times are acted there al&s;o, therefore in the Churches belong|ing to <HI>Indian</HI> Towns they have all &s;orts of Vizards, and &s;trange antick Dre&s;&s;es both for Men and Wo|men, and abundance of Mu&s;ical Hautboys and Strum&s;trums.

<P>Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> intended when they were all in the Church to &s;hut the Doors, and then make a bargain with them, letting them know what he was, and &s;o draw them afterwards by fair means to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance:

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE third day of <HI>September,</HI> 1684. we &s;ent the Frier a&s;hoar, and left the <HI>Indians</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Prize which we brought in hither, though &s;he was &s;till half laden with Flower, and we &s;ailed out with the Land Wind, pa&s;&s;ing between <HI>Amapalla</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="153">
and <HI>Mangera.</HI> When we were a league out, we &s;aw a Canoa coming with Sail and Oars after us; there|fore we &s;hortned Sail and &s;taid for her. She was a Canoa &s;ent by the Governor of St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Town to our Captain, de&s;iring him not to carry away the Frier. The Me&s;&s;enger being told, that the Frier was &s;et a&s;hoar again at <HI>Amapalla,</HI> he returned with joy, and we made Sail again, having the Wind at W. N. W. We &s;teered towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru;</HI> we had <HI>Tornadoes</HI> every day till we made Cape St. <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> which from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>November</HI> are very common on the&s;e Coa&s;ts; and we had with the <HI>Tornadoes</HI> wery much Thunder, Lightning and Rain. When the <HI>Tornadoes</HI> were over, the Winds, which while they la&s;ted, was mo&s;t from the South Ea&s;t, came about again to the We&s;t, and never failed us till we were in &s;ight of Cape St. <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> where we found the Wind at South with fair Weather. This Cape is in lat. 0 1 d. 00 North, it is a high Bluff, or full point of Land, cloathed with tall great Trees. Pa&s;&s;ing by this Point, coming from the North, you will &s;ee a &s;mall low point, which you might &s;uppo&s;e to be the Cape; but you are then pa&s;t it, and pre&s;ently afterwards it appears with three points. The Land in the Country, within this Cape, is very high, and the Mountains commonly appear very black. When we came in with this Cape, we overtook Captain <HI>Ea|ton,</HI> plying under the &s;hoar: he in his pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Amapalla,</HI> while he was on that Coa&s;t, met with &s;uch terrible <HI>Tornadoes</HI> of Thunder and Lightning, that as he and all his Men related, they had never met with the like in any place. They were very much af|frightned by them, the Air &s;melling very much of Sulphur, and they apprehending them&s;elves in great danger of being burnt by the Lightning. He touch'd at the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> and put a&s;hoar 200 Packs of Flower there, and loaded his Boat with Coco-Nuts, and took in fre&s;h Water. In the evening we &s;epa|rated
<PB N="132" REF="154">
again from Captain <HI>Eaton;</HI> for he &s;tood off to Sea, and we plied up under the &s;hoar, making our be&s;t advantage both of Sea and Land Winds. The Sea Winds are here at South, the Land Winds at S. S. E. but &s;ome times when we came abre&s;t of a River we &s;hould have the Wind at S. E.</P>
<P>The 20th day of <HI>September</HI> we came to the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> and anchored in 16 fathom. We had very good weather from the time that we fell in with Cape <HI>St. Franci&s;co;</HI> and were now fallen in again with the &s;ame places from whence I begin the ac|count of this Voyage in the fir&s;t Capter, having now compa&s;s'd in the whole Continent of the South <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> as &s;ome report, was &s;o named by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> after Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took the <HI>Cacafoga,</HI> a Ship chiefly laden with Plate, which they &s;ay he brought hither, and divided it here with his Men. It is about 4 mile long, and a mile and half broad, and of a good heighth. It is bounded with high &s;teep Cliffs clear round, only at one place on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide. The top of it is flat and even, the Soil &s;andy and dry: The Trees it produceth are but &s;mall bodied, low, and grow thin; and there are only 3 or 4 &s;orts of Trees, all unknown to us. I ob&s;erved they were much over-grown with long Mo&s;s. There is good Gra&s;s, e&s;pecially in the be|ginning of the Year. There is no Water on this I&s;land but at one place on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, clo&s;e by the Sea; there it drills &s;lowly down from the Rocks, where it may be received into Ve&s;&s;els. There was plenty of Goats, but they are now all de&s;troyed. There is no other &s;ort of Land Animal that I did ever &s;ee: here are plenty of <HI>Boobies</HI> and <HI>Men of War</HI> Birds. The anch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing place is on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, near the middle of the I&s;land, clo&s;e by the &s;hoar, within two Cables lengths of the &s;andy Bay: there is about 18 or 20 fathom good fa&s;t oazy ground, and &s;mooth water;
<PB N="133" REF="155">
for the S. E. point of the I&s;land &s;helters from the South Winds which con&s;tantly blow here. From the S. E. point there &s;trikes out a &s;mall &s;hole a quar|ter of a Mile into the Sea, where there is commonly a great riplin or working of &s;hort Waves, during all the Flood. The Tide runs pretty &s;trong, the Flood to the South, and the Ebb to the North. There is good landing on the Sandy Bay again&s;t the An|choring place, from whence you may go up into the I&s;land, and at no place be&s;ides. There are 2 or 3 high, &s;teep, &s;mall Rocks, at the S. E. point, not a Cables length from the I&s;land: and another much bigger at the N. E. end: it is deep water all round but at the anchoring place, and at the &s;hole at the S. E. point. This I&s;land lieth in lat. 0 1 d. 10 m. South. It is di&s;tant from Cape <HI>St. Lorenzo</HI> 4 or 5 leagues, bearing from it W. S. W. and half a point we&s;terly. At this I&s;land are plenty of tho&s;e &s;mall <HI>Sea Turtle</HI> &s;poken of in my la&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> came to an Anchor by us: he was very willing to have con&s;orted with us again; but Captain <HI>Davis</HI>'s Men were &s;o unrea|&s;onable, that they wou'd not allow Captain <HI>Eaton</HI>'s Men an equal &s;hare with them in what they got: therefore Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> &s;taid here but one night, and the next day &s;ailed from hence, &s;teering away to the Southward. We &s;taid no longer then the day en&s;uing, and then we &s;ailed toward Point <HI>St. Hellena,</HI> intending there to land &s;ome Men purpo&s;ely to get Pri&s;oners for Intelligence.</P>
<P>Point <HI>Santa Hellena</HI> bears South from the I&s;land <HI>Plata.</HI> It lies in lat. 2 d. 15 m. South. The Point is pretty high, flat, and even at top, overgrown with many great Thi&s;tles, but no &s;ort of Tree; at a di&s;tance it appears like an I&s;land, becau&s;e the Land within it is very low.</P>
<P>This Point &s;trikes out We&s;t into the Sea, making a pretty large Bay on the North &s;ide. A mile within the
<PB N="134" REF="156">
Point, on the Sandy Bay, clo&s;e by the Sea, there is a poor &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Village called <HI>Sancta Hellena;</HI> the Land about it is low, &s;andy and barren, there are no Trees nor Gra&s;s growing near it; neither do the <HI>Indians</HI> produce any Fruit, Grain, or Plant, but Water-Melons only, which are large and very &s;weet. There is no fre&s;h Water at this place, nor near it; therefore the Inhabitants are obliged to fetch all their Water from the River <HI>Colanche,</HI> which is in the bottom of the Bay, about 4 leagues from it. Not far from this Town on the Bay, clo&s;e by the Sea, about 5 paces from high-water mark, there is a &s;ort of <HI>bitumenous</HI> matter boils out of a little hole in the Earth; it is like thin <HI>Tar:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it <HI>Al|gatrane.</HI> By much boiling it becomes hard like Pitch. It is frequently u&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in&s;tead of Pitch; and the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabit here &s;ave it in Jars. It boils up mo&s;t at high Water; and then the <HI>Indians</HI> are ready to receive it. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are Fi&s;hermen, and go out to Sea on Bark-logs. Their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is Maiz, mo&s;t of which they get from Ships that come hither from <HI>Algatrane.</HI> There is good Anchoring to leeward of the Point, right a gain&s;t the Village: but on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Point it is deep Water, and no anchoring. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> do report, that there was once a very rich Ship dri|ven a&s;hoar here in calm, for want of Wind to work her. As &s;oon as ever &s;he &s;truck &s;he heel'd of to Sea, 7 or 8 fathom Water, where &s;he lies to this day; none having attempted to fi&s;h for her, becau&s;e &s;he lies deep and there falls in here a great high Sea. When we were abre&s;t of this Point, we &s;ent away our Canoas in the night to take the <HI>Indian</HI> Village. They landed in the Morning betimes clo&s;e by the Town, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners. They took likewi&s;e a &s;mall Bark which the <HI>Indians</HI> had &s;et on fire, but our Men quenched it, and took the <HI>Indian</HI> that did it;
<PB N="135" REF="157">
who being a&s;ked wherefore he &s;et the Bark on fire, &s;aid, that there was an Order from the Vice-Roy lately &s;et out, commanding all Seamen to burn their Ve&s;&s;els, if atttack'd by us, and betake them|&s;elves to their Boats. There was another Bark in a &s;mall Cove, a Mile from the Village, thither our Men went, thinking to take her, but the Seamen that were aboard &s;et her in Flames and fled: In the Evening our Men came aboard, and brought the &s;mall Bark with them, the fire of which they had quenched; and then we returned again towards <HI>Plata;</HI> where we arrived the 26th day of <HI>Septem|ber.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening we &s;ent out &s;ome Men in our Bark lately taken, and Canoas, to an <HI>Indian</HI> Village called <HI>Manta,</HI> 2 or 3 leagues to the We&s;t-ward of Cape St. <HI>Lorenzo;</HI> hoping there to get other Pri&s;o|ners, for we could not learn from tho&s;e we took at Point St. <HI>Hellena</HI> the rea&s;on why the Vice-Roy &s;hould give &s;uch Orders to burn the Ships. They had a fre&s;h Sea-breez till 12 a Clock at Night, and then it proved calm; wherefore they rowed away with their Canoas as near to the Town as they thought convenient, and lay &s;till till day.</P>
<P><HI>Manta</HI> is a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Village on the Main, di|&s;tant from the I&s;land <HI>Plata</HI> 7 or 8 leagues. It &s;tands &s;o advantageou&s;ly to be &s;een, being built on a &s;mall A&s;cent, that it makes a very fair Pro&s;pect to the Sea; yet but a few poor &s;cattering <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es. There is a very fine Church, adorned with a great deal of carved Work. It was formerly a Habitation of <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> but they are all removed from hence now. The Land about it is dry and &s;andy, bearing only a few &s;hrubby Trees. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> plant no man|ner of Grain or Root, but are &s;upplied from other places; and commonly keep a &s;tock of Provi&s;ion to relieve Ships that want; for this is the fir&s;t Settle|ment that Ships can touch at, which come from <HI>Pa|nama,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="158">
bound to <HI>Lima,</HI> or any other Port in <HI>Pern.</HI> The Land being dry and &s;andy, is not fit to produce Crops of Maiz; which is the rea&s;on they plant none. There is a Spring of good Water between the Village and the Seas.</P>
<P>On the back of the Town, a pretty way up in the Country, there is a very high Mountain, towr|ing up like a Sugar-Loaf, called <HI>Monte-Chri&s;to.</HI> It is a very good Sea-mark, for there is none like it on all the Coa&s;t. The Body of this Mountain bears due South from <HI>Manta.</HI> About a mile and half from the &s;hore right again&s;t the Village, there is a Rock which is very dangerous, becau&s;e it never appears above Water; neither doth the Sea break on it, be|cau&s;e here is &s;eldom any great Sea; yet it is now &s;o well known, that all Ships bound to this place do ea&s;ily avoid it. A mile within this Rock there is good anchoring, in 6, 8, or 10 fathom Water, good hard Sand and clear Ground: And a Mile from the Road on the We&s;t-&s;ide, there is a &s;hoal running out a Mile into the Sea. From <HI>Manta</HI> to Cape <HI>St Lorenzo</HI> the Land is plain and even, of an indifferent heighth. [See a further Account of the&s;e Coa&s;ts in the Ap|pendix.]</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever the day appear'd our Men landed and marched towards the Village, which was about a Mile and a half from their Land place: Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> who were &s;tirring, &s;aw them coming, and alarmed their Neighbours; &s;o that all that were able got away. They took only two old Women, who both &s;aid, that it was reported that a great many Enemies were come over Land thro' the Country of <HI>Darien</HI> into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and that they were at pre&s;ent in Canoas and Periagoes: and that the Vice-Roy upon this News had &s;et out the fore-men|tioned order for burning their own Ships. Our Men found no &s;ort of Provi&s;ion here; the Vice-Roy having likewi&s;e &s;ent orders to all Sea-ports to
<PB N="137" REF="159">
keep no Provi&s;ion, but ju&s;t to &s;upply them&s;elves. The&s;e Women al&s;o &s;aid, that the <HI>Manta Indians</HI> were &s;ent over to the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> to de&s;troy all the Goats there; which they performed about a Month agone. With this News our Men returned again, and arriv'd at <HI>Plata</HI> the next day.</P>
<P>We lay &s;till at the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> being not re&s;olved what to do; till the 2d day of <HI>Octob.</HI> and then Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> in the <HI>Cygnet of London</HI> arriv'd there. He was fitted out by very Eminent Merchants of that City, on a de&s;ign only to Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>In|dians,</HI> having a very con&s;iderable Cargo well &s;orted for the&s;e parts of the World; but meeting with di|vers Di&s;appointments, and being out of hopes to ob|tain a Trade in the&s;e Seas, his Men forced him to en|tertain a Company of Privateers which he met with near <HI>Nicoya,</HI> a Town whither he was going to &s;eek a Trade, and the&s;e Privateers were bound thither in Boats to get a Ship. The&s;e were the Men that we had heard of at <HI>Manta;</HI> they came over Land under the command of Capt. <HI>Peter Harris,</HI> Nephew to that Capt. <HI>Harris,</HI> who was killed before <HI>Panama.</HI> Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> was &s;till commander of his own Ship, and Capt. <HI>Harris</HI> commanded a &s;mall Bark under Capt. <HI>Swan.</HI> There was much Joy on all &s;ides when they arriv'd; and immediately hereupon Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> con&s;orted, wi&s;hing for Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> again. Our little Bark, which was taken at <HI>Santa Hellena,</HI> was immediately &s;ent out to cruize, while the Ships were fitting; for Capt. <HI>Swan's</HI> Ship being full of Goods, was not fit to entertain his new Gue&s;t, till the Goods were di&s;po&s;ed of; therefore he, by the con&s;ent of the Super-cargo's, got up all his Goods on Deck, and &s;old to any one that would buy upon Tru&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the re&s;t was thrown over board into the Sea, except fine Goods, as Silks, Mu&s;lins, Stockins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the Iron, whereof he had a good Quantity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> wrought and in Bars: This was &s;aved for Balla&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="160">
The third day after our Bark was &s;ent to cruize, &s;he brought in a Prize of 400 Tuns, laden with Timber: They took her in the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil;</HI> &s;he came from a Town of that Name, and was bound to <HI>Lima.</HI> The Commander of this Prize &s;aid, that it was generally reported and believed at <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> that the Vice-Roy was fitting out 10 Sail of Frigots to drive us out of the Seas. This news made our un&s;ettled Crew wi&s;h, that they had been per&s;waded to accept of Captain <HI>Eaton</HI>'s Company on rea&s;onable Terms. Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e concerning Capt. <HI>Eaton;</HI> they at la&s;t concluded to &s;end our &s;mall Bark towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Lima,</HI> as far as the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> to &s;eek Capt. <HI>Eaton.</HI> This being approved by all hands, &s;he was clean'd the next day, and &s;ent away mann'd with 20 Men, 10 of Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s, and 10 of <HI>Swan</HI>'s Men, and Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> writ a Letter directed to Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> de&s;iring his Company, and the I&s;le of <HI>Plata</HI> was appointed for the general Rendezvous. When this Bark was gone, we turn'd another Bark, which we had into a Fire-&s;hip; having 6 or 7 Carpenters; who &s;oon fixt her; and while the Carpenters were at work about the Fire-&s;hip, we &s;crubbed and clean'd our Men of War, as well as time and place would permit.</P>
<P>The 19th day of <HI>Oct.</HI> we fini&s;hed our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the 20th day we &s;ailed towards the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> where our Bark was ordered to &s;tay for us, or meet us again at <HI>Plata.</HI> We had but litte Wind, there|fore it was the 23d day before we pa&s;&s;ed by Point <HI>St. Hellena.</HI> The 25th day we cro&s;&s;ed over the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> The 30th day we doubled Cape <HI>Blanco.</HI> This Cape is in lat. 3 d. 45 m. It is counted the wor&s;t Cape in all the <HI>South Seas</HI> to double, pa&s;&s;ing to the Southward; for in all other places Ships may &s;tand off to Sea 20 or 30 Leagues off, if they find they
<PB N="139" REF="161">
cannot get any thing under the Shoar; but here they dare not do it: for, by relation of the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> they find a Current &s;etting N. W. which will carry a Ship off more in two Hours, than they can run in again in five. Be&s;ides, &s;etting to the North|ward they lo&s;e ground: therefore they always beat up in under the Shoar, which oft-times they find very difficult, becau&s;e the Wind commonly blows very &s;trong at S. S. W. or S. by W. without altering; for here are never any Land-winds. This Cape is of an indifferent heighth: it is fenced with White Rocks to the Sea; for which rea&s;on, I believe, it hath this Name. The Land in the Country &s;eems to be full of high, &s;teep, rugged and barren Rocks.</P>
<P>The 2d day of <HI>November</HI> we got as high as <HI>Pay|ta:</HI> We lay about &s;ix Leagues off &s;hoar all the day, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might not &s;ee us; and in the E|vening &s;ent our Canoas a&s;hoar to take it, Mann'd with 110 Men.</P>
<P><HI>Payta</HI> is a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sea-Port Town in the lat, of 5 d. 15 m. It is built on the Sand, clo&s;e by the Sea, in a Nook, Elbow, or &s;mall Bay, under a pret|ty high Hill. There are not above 75 or 80 Hou&s;es, and two Churches. The Hou&s;es are but low and ill built. The Building in this Country of <HI>Peru</HI> is much alike, on all the Sea-Coa&s;t. The Walls are built of Brick, made with Earth and Straw kneaded toge|ther: They are about three foot long, two foot broad, and a foot and a half thick: They never burn them, but lay them a long time in the Sun to dry before they are u&s;ed in building. In &s;ome places they have no Roofs, only Poles laid a-cro&s;s from the &s;ide Walls, and covered with Matts; and then tho&s;e Walls are carry'd up to a con&s;iderable heighth. But where they build Roofs upon their Hou&s;es, the Walls are not made &s;o high, as I &s;aid before. The Hou&s;es in general all over this Kingdom are but meanly built; one chief Rea&s;on, with the common People e&s;peci|ally,
<PB N="140" REF="162">
is the want of Materials to build withal; for however it be more within Land, yet here is nei|ther Stone nor Timber to build with, nor any Mate|rials but &s;uch Brick as I have de&s;cribed; and ever the Stone which they have in &s;ome places is &s;o brit|tle, that you may rub it into Sand with your fingers. Another rea&s;on why they build &s;o meanly is, be|cau&s;e it never rains; therefore they only endeavour to fence them&s;elves from the Sun. Yet their Walls, which are built but with an ordinary &s;ort of Brick, in compari&s;on with what is made in other parts of the World, continue a long time as firm as when fir&s;t made, having never any Winds nor Rains, to rot, moulder, or &s;hake them. However, the richer &s;ort have Timber, which they make u&s;e of in build|ing; but it is brought from other places.</P>
<P>This dry Country commences to the Northward, from about Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> to <HI>Coquimbo,</HI> in about 30 d. S. having no Rain that I could ever ob&s;erve or hear of; nor any green thing growing in the Mountains; nei|ther yet in the Valleys, except where here and there water'd with a few &s;mall Rivers di&s;pers'd up and down. So that the Northermo&s;t parts of this Tract of Land are &s;upplied with Timber from <HI>Guiaquil, Galleo, Tornato,</HI> and other places that are watered with Rains; where there are plenty of all &s;orts of Timber. In the South parts, as about <HI>Gua&s;co</HI> and <HI>Coquimbo,</HI> they fetch their Timber from the I&s;land <HI>Chiloe,</HI> or other places thereabouts. The Walls of Churches and rich Mens Hou&s;es are whitened with Lime, both within and without; and the Doors and Po&s;ts are very large, and adorned with carved Work, and the Beams al&s;o in the Churches: The in&s;ide of the Hou&s;es are hung round with rich embroidered, or painted Cloths. They have likewi&s;e abundance of fine Pictures, which adds no &s;mall Ornament to their Hou&s;e: The&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, they have from <HI>Old Spain.</HI> But the Hou&s;es of <HI>Payta</HI> are none of them
<PB N="141" REF="163">
&s;o richly furni&s;hed. The Churches were large and fairly carved: At one end of the Town there was a &s;mall Fort clo&s;e by the Sea, but no great Guns in it. This Fort, only with Mu&s;quets, will command all the Bay, &s;o as to hinder any Boats from landing. There is another Fort on the top of the Hill, ju&s;t over the Town, which commands both it and the lower Fort. There is neither Wood nor Water to be had there: they fetch their Water from an <HI>Indian.</HI> Town called <HI>Colan,</HI> about 2 Leagues N. N. E. from <HI>Payta:</HI> for at <HI>Colan,</HI> there is a &s;mall River of fre&s;h Water, which runs out into the Sea; from whence Ships that touch at <HI>Payta</HI> are &s;upplied with Water and other Refre&s;hments, as Fowls, Hogs, Plantains, Yams, and Maiz: <HI>Payta</HI> being de&s;titute of all the&s;e things, only as they fetch them from <HI>Colon,</HI> as they have occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Colan</HI> are all Fi&s;hermen: they go out to Sea and fi&s;h for Bark-logs. Bark-logs are made of many round Logs of Wood, in manner of a Raft, and very different according to the u&s;e that they are de&s;igned for, or the humour of the people that make them, or the matter that they are made of. If they are made for fi&s;hing, then they are on|ly 3 or 4 Logs of light Wood, of 7 or 8 foot long, plac'd by the &s;ide of each other, pinn'd fa&s;t together with wooden Pins, and bound hard with Withes. The Logs are &s;o placed, that the middlemo&s;t are longer than tho&s;e by the &s;ides, e&s;pecially at the head or fore-part, which grows narrower gradually into an angle or point, the better to cut through the Water. Others are made to carry Goods: The bot|tom of the&s;e is made of 20 or 30 great Trees of a|bout 20, 30, or 40 foot long, fa&s;ten'd like the other, &s;ide to &s;ide, and &s;o &s;haped: on the top of the&s;e they place another &s;horter row of Trees acro&s;s them, pinn'd fa&s;t to each other, and then pinn'd to the un|dermo&s;t row: this double row of Planks makes the

bottom of the Float, and of a con&s;iderable breadth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> From this bottom the Raft is rai&s;ed to about 10 foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> higher, with rows of Po&s;ts &s;ometimes &s;et upright, and &s;upporting a Floor or two; but tho&s;e I ob&s;erv'd were rais'd by thick Trees laid a-cro&s;s each other, as in Wood-piles; only not clo&s;e together, as in the bottom of the Float, but at the ends and &s;ides only, &s;o as to leave the middle all hollow like a Chamber except that here and there a Beam goes a-cro&s;s it, to keep the Float more compact. In this Hollow, at about 4 foot heighth from the Beams at the bottom, they lay &s;mall Poles along, and clo&s;e together, to make a floor for another Room, on the top of which al&s;o they lay another &s;uch floor made of Poles; and the enterances in both the&s;e Rooms is only by creep|ing between the great traver&s;e Trees which make the Walls of this Sea-Hou&s;e. The lowe&s;t of the&s;e &s;tories &s;erves as a Cellar: there they lay great &s;tones for Balla&s;t, and their Jars of fre&s;h Water clo&s;ed up, and whatever may bear being wet; for by the weight of the Balla&s;t and Cargo, the bottom of this Room, and of the whole Ve&s;&s;el, is &s;unk &s;o deep, as to lie 2 or 3 feet within the &s;urface of the Water. The &s;econd &s;tory is for the Sea-men, and their ne|ce&s;&s;aries. Above this &s;econd &s;tory the Goods are &s;towed to what heighth they plea&s;e, u&s;ually about 8 or 10 feet, and kept together by poles &s;et upright quite round: only there is a little &s;pace abaft for the Steers-man, (for they have a large Rudder) and afore for the Fire-hearth, to dre&s;s their Victuals, e&s;pe|cially when they make long Voyages, as from <HI>Lima</HI> to <HI>Truxillo</HI> or <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> or <HI>Panama;</HI> which la&s;t Voy|age is 5 or 600 leagues. In the mid&s;t of all, among the Goods, ri&s;es a Ma&s;t, to which is fa&s;tned a large Sail, as in our We&s;t-Country Barges in the <HI>Thames.</HI> They always go before the Wind, being unable to Ply again&s;t it; and therefore are fit only for the&s;e Seas, where the Wind is always in a manner the

All their care then is only to keep off from Shoar; for they are &s;o made that they cannot &s;ink at Sea. The&s;e Rafts carry 60 or 70 Tuns of Goods and upwards; their Cargo is chiefly Wine, Oil, Flower, Sugar, <HI>Quito</HI> Cloth, Soap, Goat-&s;kins dre&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Float is manag'd u&s;ually by 3 or 4 Men, who being unable to return with it again&s;t the Trade-wind, when they come to <HI>Panama</HI> di&s;po&s;e of the goods and bottom together; getting a pa&s;&s;age back again for them&s;elves in &s;ome Ship or Boat bound to the Port they came from; and there they make a new Bark-log for their next Cargo.</P>
<P>The &s;maller &s;ort of Bark-logs, de&s;cribed before, which lie flat on the Water, and are u&s;ed for Fi&s;h|ing or carrying Water to Ships, or the like (half a Tun or a Tun at a time) are more governable than the other, tho' they have Ma&s;ts and Sails too. With the&s;e they go out at night by the help of the Land-wind (which is &s;eldom wanting on this Coa&s;t) and return back in the day time with the Sea-wind.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of Floats are u&s;ed in many places both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> On the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coro|mandel</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> they call them <HI>Catamarans.</HI> The&s;e are but one Log, or two &s;ometimes, of a &s;ort of light Wood, and are made without Sail or Rud|der, and &s;o &s;mall, that they carry but one Man, who&s;e legs and breech are always in the Water, and he manages his Log with a Paddle, appearing at a di&s;tance like a Man &s;itting on a Fi&s;h's back.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Payta</HI> is mountainous and bar|ren, like all the re&s;t of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru.</HI> There is no Towns of con&s;equence nearer it than <HI>Piura,</HI> which is a large Town in the Country 40 miles di|&s;tant.

It lieth, by report of our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, in a Valley which is water'd with a &s;mall River, that di&s;embogues it &s;elf into the Bay of <HI>Chirapee,</HI> in about 7 d. of North latitude. This Bay is nearer to <HI>Piura</HI> than <HI>Payta:</HI> yet all Goods imported by Sea for <HI>Piura</HI> are landed at <HI>Payta,</HI> for the Bay of <HI>Chirapee</HI> is full of dangerous &s;holes, and therefore not frequented by &s;hipping. The Road of <HI>Payta</HI> is one of the be&s;t on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru.</HI> It is &s;heltered from the South-we&s;t by a Point of Land, which makes a large Bay and &s;mooth Water for Ships to ride in. There is room enough for a good Fleet of Ships, and good anchoring in any depth, from 6 fathom Water to 20 fathom. Right again&s;t the Town, the nearer the Town the Shallower the Water, and the &s;moother the riding; it is clean Sand all over the Bay.

<P><HI>November</HI> the 3d, at 6 a clock in the morning, our Men landed, about 4 miles to the South of the Town, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners that were &s;ent thi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">her to watch for fear of us; and the&s;e Pri&s;oners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, That the Governour of <HI>Piura</HI> came with 100 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rmed Men to <HI>Payta</HI> the night before purpo&s;ely to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ppo&s;e our landing there, if we &s;hould attempt it.</P>
<P>Our Men marched directly to the Fort on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, and took it without the lo&s;s of one Man.

Then our Men entered the Town, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it emptied both of Money and Goods; there was not &s;o much as a Meal of Victuals left for them. The Pri&s;oners told us a Ship had been here a lit|tle before and burnt a great Ship in the Road, but
<PB N="145" REF="167">
did not land their Men; and that here they put a|&s;hore all their Pri&s;oners and Pilots. We knew this mu&s;t be Captain <HI>Eaton</HI>'s Ship which had done this, and by the&s;e circum&s;tances we &s;uppo&s;ed he was gone to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> it being always de&s;ign'd by him. The Pri&s;oners told us al&s;o, That &s;ince Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> was here, a &s;mall Bark had been off the Harbour, and taken a pair of Bark-logs a fi&s;hing, and made the Fi&s;hermen bring aboard 20 or 30 Jars of fre&s;h Water. This we &s;uppo&s;ed was our Bark that was &s;ent to rhe <HI>Lobos</HI> to &s;eek Capt. <HI>Eaton.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening we came in with our Ships, and anchored before the Town in 10 fathom Water, near a Mile from the Shore. Here we &s;taid till the &s;ixth day, in hopes to get a Ran&s;om for the Town. Our Captains demanded 300 Packs of Flower, 3000 pound of Sugar, 25 Jars of Wine, and 1000 Jars of Water to be brought off to us; but we got nothing of it. Therefore Captain <HI>Swan</HI> ordered the Town to be fired, which was pre&s;ently done. Then all our Men came aboard, and Captain <HI>Swan</HI> ordered the Bark which Captain <HI>Harris</HI> commanded, to be burnt, becau&s;e &s;he did not &s;ail well.</P>
<P>At Night, when the Land-wind came off, we &s;ailed from hence towards <HI>Lobos.</HI> The 10th Day in the Evening we &s;aw a Sail bearing N.

<P>The 14th day we had &s;ight of the I&s;land <HI>Lobos de Terra:</HI> It bore Ea&s;t from us; we &s;tood in towards it, and betwixt 7 and 8 a Clock in the Night came to an Anchor at the N.

This I&s;land at Sea is of an indifferent height, and appears like <HI>Lobos de la Mar.</HI> About a quarter of a Mile from the North-end there is a great hollow
<PB N="146" REF="168">
Rock, and a good Channel between, where there is 7 fathom Water. The 15th day we went a&s;hore, and found abundance of Penguins and Boobies, and Seal in great quantities. We &s;ent aboard of all the&s;e to be dre&s;t, for we had not ta&s;ted any Fle&s;h in a great while before; therefore &s;ome of us did eat very heartily. Capt. <HI>Swan,</HI> to encourage his Men to eat this cour&s;e Fle&s;h, would commend it for extraordi|nary good Food, comparing the Seal to a roa&s;ting Pig, the Boobies to Hens, and the Penguins to Ducks: This he did to train them to live contentedly on cour&s;e Meat, not knowing but we might be forced to make u&s;e of &s;uch Food before we departed out of the&s;e Seas; for it is generally &s;een among Privateers, that nothing emboldens them &s;ooner to mutiny than want, which we could not well &s;uffer in a place where there are &s;uch quantities of the&s;e Animals to be had, if Men could be per&s;waded to be content with them.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we &s;ailed from <HI>Lobos de Terra,</HI> with the Wind at S. by E. and arriv'd at <HI>Lobos de la Mar</HI> on the 19th day. Here we found a Letter, left by our Bark that was &s;ent to &s;eek Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> by which we under&s;tood, that Captain <HI>Eaton</HI> had been there, but was gone before they arrived, and had left no Letter to advi&s;e us which way he was gone; and that our Bark was again returned to <HI>Plata,</HI> in hopes to find us there, or meet us by the way, el&s;e re&s;olving to &s;tay for us there. We were &s;orry to hear that Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> was gone, for now we did not ex|pect to meet with him any more in the&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day we &s;ent out our <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI> Strikers for Turtle, who brought aboard enough to &s;erve both Ships Companies; and this they did all the time that we abode here. While we lay at this I&s;land, Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> made new Yards, &s;quarer than tho&s;e he had before, and made his Sails larger, and our Ships Company in the mean time &s;plit Plank for Fire-wood,
<PB N="147" REF="169">
and put aboard as many Planks as we could conveniently &s;tow, for other u&s;es: Here being Plank enough of all &s;orts, which we had brought hither in the fir&s;t Prize that we took, and left here.</P>
<P>The 26th day in the Evening we &s;aw a &s;mall Bark about 3 Leagues N. N. W. from the I&s;land, but we &s;uppo&s;ing her to be our own Bark, did not go after her. The next Morning &s;he was two Leagues South of the I&s;land, &s;tanding off to Sea; but we did not now chace her neither, altho' we knew &s;he was not our Bark; for being to Windward of us, &s;he could have made her e&s;cape, if we had chaced her. This Bark, as we were afterwards inform'd, was &s;ent out purpo&s;ely to &s;ee if we were at this I&s;land. Her Orders were, not to come too near, only to ap|pear in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight; they &s;uppo&s;ing that if we were here we &s;hould &s;oon be after her; as indeed it was a wonder we had not chaced her: But our not doing &s;o, and lying clo&s;e under the I&s;land undi&s;cern'd by them, was a great occa&s;ion of our coming upon <HI>Pu|na</HI> afterwards unexectedly, they being now without fear of any Enemy &s;o near them:</P>
<P>The 28th day we &s;crubbed our Ships bottom, in|tending to &s;ail the next day towards <HI>Guiaquil;</HI> it be|ing concluded upon to attempt that Town before we returned again to <HI>Plata.</HI> Accordingly, on the 29th day in the Morning, we loo&s;ed from hence, &s;teering directly for the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> This Bay runs in between Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> on the South-&s;ide, and Point <HI>Chandy</HI> on the North. About 25 Leagues from C. <HI>Blanco,</HI> near the bottom of the Bay, there is a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> which lies Ea&s;t and We&s;t: It is of an indifferent length, and it appears like a dead Man &s;tretched out in a Shroud. The Ea&s;t-end repre&s;ents the Head, and the We&s;t-end the Feet. Ships that are bound into the River of <HI>Guia|quil</HI> pa&s;s on the South-&s;ide, to avoid the &s;holes which lie on the North-&s;ide of it; whereon for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Ships

It is reported by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that there is a very rich Wreck lies on the North-&s;ide of that I&s;land, not far from it; and that &s;ome of the Plate hath been taken up by one who came from <HI>Old Spain,</HI> with a Patent from the King to fi&s;h in tho&s;e Seas for Wrecks; but he dying, the Project ceas'd, and the Wreck &s;till remains as he left it; only the <HI>Indians</HI> by &s;tealth do &s;ometimes take up &s;ome of it; and they might have taken up much more, if it were not for the <HI>Cat-fi&s;h</HI> which &s;warms hereabouts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cat-fi&s;h</HI> is much like a <HI>Whiting,</HI> but the Head is flatter and bigger. It hath a great wide Mouth, and certain &s;mall Strings pointing out from each &s;ide of it, like <HI>Cats Whi&s;kers,</HI> and for that rea&s;on it is call'd a <HI>Cat-fi&s;h.</HI> It hath three Fins, one growing on the top of his Back, and one on either &s;ide. Each of the&s;e Fins have a &s;tiff &s;harp Bone, which is very ve|nomous if it &s;trikes into a Man's Fle&s;h; therefore it it is dangerous diving where many of the&s;e Fi&s;h are. The <HI>Indians</HI> that adventured to &s;earch this Wreck, have to their &s;orrow experienc'd it; &s;ome having lo&s;t their Lives, others the u&s;e of their Limbs by it: This we were informed by an <HI>Indian,</HI> who him&s;elf had been fi&s;hing on it by &s;tealth.

<P>From the I&s;land <HI>Santa Clara</HI> to <HI>Punta Arena</HI> is 7 leagues E. N. E. This <HI>Punta Arena,</HI> or <HI>Sandy Point,</HI> is the We&s;termo&s;t Point of the I&s;land <HI>Puna.</HI> Here all Ships bound into the River of <HI>Guiaquil</HI> anchor, and mu&s;t wait for a Pilot, the enterance being very dan|gerous for Strangers.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Puna</HI> is a pretty large flat low I&s;land, &s;tretching Ea&s;t and We&s;t about 12 or 14 leagues long, and about 4 or 5 leagues wide. The Tide runs very &s;trong all about this I&s;land, but &s;o many different ways, by rea&s;on of the Branches, Creeks and Rivers that run into the Sea near it, that it ca&s;ts up many dangerous &s;holes on all &s;ides of it. There is in the I&s;land only one <HI>Indian</HI> Town on the South|&s;ide of it, clo&s;e by the Sea, and 7 leagues from <HI>Point Arena,</HI> which Town is al&s;o called <HI>Puna.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> of this Town are all Seamen, and are the only Pi|lots in the&s;e Seas, e&s;pecially for this River. Their chiefe&s;t employment, when they are not at Sea, is fi&s;hing. The&s;e Men are obliged by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to keep good watch for Ships that anchor at Point <HI>Are|na;</HI> which, as I &s;aid before, is 7 leagues from the Town <HI>Puna.</HI> The place where they keep this watch is at a Point of Land on the I&s;land <HI>Puna,</HI> that &s;tarts
<PB N="150" REF="172">
out into the Sea; from whence they can &s;ee all Ships that anchor at Point <HI>Arena.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> come thither in the morning, and return at night on Hor&s;eback. From this watching Point, to Point <HI>Arena,</HI> it is 4 leagues, all drowned Mangrove-Land: And in the midway between the&s;e two Points is ano|ther &s;mall Point, where the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are obliged to keep another Watch, when they fear an Enemy. The Centinel goes thither in a Canoa in the morn|ing, and returns at night; for there is no coming thither by Land, through that Mangrove mar&s;hy ground. The middle of the I&s;land <HI>Puna</HI> is Savannah or Pa&s;ture. There are &s;ome ridges of good Wood|land, which is of a light Yellow or &s;andy Mould, producing large tall Trees mo&s;t unknown even to Travellers: But there are plenty of <HI>Palmeto-Trees,</HI> which becau&s;e I am acquainted with, I &s;hall de|&s;cibe. The <HI>Palmeto-Tree</HI> is about the bigne&s;s of an ordinary A&s;h: It is about 30 foot high; the body &s;traight, without any limb, or branch, or leaf, ex|cept at the head only, where it &s;preads forth into many &s;mall Branches, not half &s;o big as a Mans Arm, &s;ome no bigger than ones Finger: The&s;e Branches, are about 3 or 4 foot long, clear from any knot: At the end of the Branch there groweth one broad leaf, about the bigne&s;s of a large Fan. This, when it fir&s;t &s;hoots forth, grows in folds, like a Fan when it is clo&s;ed; and &s;till as it grows bigger &s;o it opens, till it becomes like a Fan &s;pread abroad. It is &s;trengthened towards the &s;talk with many &s;mall ribs &s;pringing from thence, and growing into the leaf; which as they grow near the end of the leaf, grow thinner and &s;maller. The leaves that make the bru&s;h part of the Flag-brooms which are brought in|to <HI>England,</HI> grow ju&s;t in this manner; and are in|deed a &s;mall kind of <HI>Palmeto;</HI> for there are of them of &s;everal dimen&s;ions. In <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, they make Hats, Ba&s;kets, Brooms, Fans to blow
<PB N="151" REF="173">
the fire in&s;tead of Bellows, with many other Hou&s;e|implements, of <HI>Palmeto-leaves.</HI> On the Ridges where the&s;e Trees grow, the <HI>Indians</HI> have here and there Plantations of Maiz, Yams, and Potatoes.</P>
<P>There are in the Town of <HI>Puna</HI> about 20 Hou&s;es, and a &s;mall Church. The Hou&s;es &s;tand all on Po&s;ts, 10 or 12 foot high, with Ladders on the out&s;ide to go up into them. I did never &s;ee the like Building any where but among the <HI>Malayans</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> They are thatched with <HI>Palmeto-leaves,</HI> and their Chambers well boarded, in which la&s;t they exceed the <HI>Malayans.</HI> The be&s;t place for Ships to lie at an Anchor is again&s;t the middle of the Town. There is 5 fathom Water within a Cables length of the &s;hoar, and good &s;oft deep Oaze where Ships may careen, or hale a&s;hoar; it &s;tows 15 or 16 foot Wa|ter up and down.</P>
<P>From <HI>Puna</HI> to <HI>Guiaquil</HI> is reckoned 7 leagues. It is 1 league before you come to the River of <HI>Guiaquil</HI>'s mouth, where it is above two mile wide; from thence upwards the River lies pretty &s;treight, with|out any con&s;iderable turnings. Both &s;ides of the Ri|ver are low &s;wampy Land, over-grown with Red Mangroves, &s;o that there is no landing. Four mile before you come to the Town of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> there's a low I&s;land &s;tanding in the River. This I&s;land di|vides the River into two parts, making 2 very fair Channels for Ships to pa&s;s up and down. The S. W. Channel is the wide&s;t, the other is as deep, but nar|rower and narower yet, by rea&s;on of many Trees and Bu&s;hes, which &s;pread over the River, both from the Main and from the I&s;land; and there are al&s;o &s;everal great &s;tumps of Trees &s;tanding upright in the Water on either &s;ide. The I&s;land is above a mile long. From the upper part of the I&s;land to the Town of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> is almo&s;t a league, and near as much from one &s;ide of the River to the other. In that &s;pacious place Ships of the greate&s;t burthen may
<PB N="152" REF="174">
ride afloat; but the be&s;t place for Ships is neare&s;t to that part of the Land where the Town &s;tands; and this place is &s;eldom without Ships. <HI>Guiaquil</HI> &s;tands facing the I&s;land, clo&s;e by the River, partly on the &s;ide, and partly at the foot of a gentle Hill decli|ning towards the River, by which the lower part of it is often overflown. There are two Forts, one &s;tanding on the low Ground, the other on the Hill. This Town makes a very fine pro&s;pect, it being beautify'd with &s;everal Churches and other good Buildings. Here lives a Governor, who, as I have been informed, hath his Patent from the King of <HI>Spain. Guiaquil</HI> may be reckoned one of the chiefe&s;t Sea-ports in the <HI>South Seas:</HI> The Commodities which are exported from hence are Cacao, Hides, Tallow, Sar&s;aparilla, and other Drugs, and Woollen-Cloth, commonly called Cloth of <HI>Quito.</HI></P>
<P>The Cacao grows on both &s;ides of the River a|bove the Town. It is a &s;mall Nut, like the <HI>Campea|chy</HI> Nut: I think the &s;malle&s;t of the two; they pro|duce as much Cacoa here as &s;erves all the Kingdom of <HI>Peru;</HI> and much of it is &s;ent to <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Phillipine I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>Sar&s;aparilla grows in the Water by the &s;ides of the River, as I have been informed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quito</HI> Cloth comes from a rich Town in the Country within Land called <HI>Quito.</HI> There is a great deal made, both Serges and Broad-Cloth. This Cloth is not very fine, but is worn by the common &s;ort of People throughout the whole Kingdom of <HI>Peru.</HI> This and all other Commodities, which come from <HI>Quito,</HI> are &s;hipt off at <HI>Guiaquil</HI> for other Parts; and all imported Goods for the City of <HI>Qui|to</HI> pa&s;s by <HI>Guiaquil:</HI> By which it may appear that <HI>Guiaquil</HI> is a Place of no mean Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Quito,</HI> as I have been informed, is a very popu|lous City, &s;eated in the heart of the Country. It is inhabited partly by <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but the major part of
<PB N="153" REF="175">
its Inhabitants are <HI>Indians,</HI> under the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Go|vernment.</P>
<P>It is environed with Mountains of a va&s;t heighth, from who&s;e bowels many great Rivers have their ri&s;e. The&s;e Mountains abound in Gold, which by violent Rains is wa&s;h'd with the Sand into the adjacent Brooks, where the <HI>Indians</HI> re&s;ort in Troops, wa&s;hing away the Sand, and putting up the Gold-du&s;t in their Calaba&s;hes or Gourd Shells: But for the manner of the gathering the Gold I refer you too Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI>'s Book: only I &s;hall remark here, that <HI>Quito</HI> is the place in all the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> that abounds mo&s;t with this Rich Metal, as I have been often informed.</P>
<P>The Country is &s;ubject to great Rains, and very thick Fogs, e&s;pecially the Valleys. For that rea&s;on it is very unwhole&s;ome and &s;ickly. The chiefe&s;t Di&s;tempers are Fevers, violent Head-ach, Pains in the Bowels, and Fluxes. I know no place where Gold is found but what is very unhealthy: As I &s;hall more particularly relate when I come to &s;peak of <HI>Acbin</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies. Guia|quil</HI> is not &s;o &s;ickly as <HI>Quito</HI> and other Towns farther within Land; yet in compari&s;on with the Towns that are on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mare Pacifico,</HI> South of Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> it is very &s;ickly.</P>
<P>It was to this Town of <HI>Guiaquil</HI> that we were bound, therefore we left our Ships off Cape <HI>Blanco,</HI> and ran into the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil</HI> with our Bark and Canoas, &s;teering in for the I&s;land <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> where we arrived the next day after we left our Ships, and from thence we &s;ent away two Canoas the next evening to Point <HI>Arena.</HI> At this Point there are abundance of Oy&s;ters, and other Shell-fi&s;h, as Cockles and Mu&s;cles; therefore the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Puna</HI> often come hither to get the&s;e Fi&s;h. Our Canoas got over before day, and ab&s;conded in a Creek, to wait for the coming of the <HI>Puna Indians.</HI> The next morning
<PB N="154" REF="176">
&s;ome of them, according to their cu&s;tom, came thither on Bark-logs, at the latter part of the Ebb, and were all taken by our Men. The next day, by their advice, the two Watchmen of the <HI>Indian</HI> Town <HI>Puna</HI> were taken by our Men, and all its Inhabitants, not one e&s;caping. The next Ebb they took a &s;mall Bark laden with <HI>Quito-cloth.</HI> She came from <HI>Guia|quil</HI> that Tide, and was bound to <HI>Lima,</HI> they having advice that we were gone off the Coa&s;t, by the Bark which I &s;aid we &s;aw while we lay at the I&s;land <HI>Lo|bos.</HI> The Ma&s;ter of this Cloth-Bark informed our Men, that there were 3 Barks coming from <HI>Guia|quil,</HI> laden with Negroes: he &s;aid they would come from thence the next Tide. The &s;ame Tide of Ebb that they took the Cloth-bark, they &s;ent a Canoa to our Bark, where the bigge&s;t part of the Men were to ha&s;ten them away with &s;peed to the <HI>Indian</HI> Town The Bark was now riding at Point <HI>Arena;</HI> and the next Flood &s;he came with all the Men, and the re&s;t of the Canoas to <HI>Puna.</HI> The Tide of Flood being now far &s;pent, we lay at this Town till the la&s;t of the Ebb, and then rowed away, leaving 5 Men aboard our Bark, who were ordered to lie &s;till till 8 a clock the next morning, and not to fire at any Boat or Bark, but after that time they might fire at any ob|ject: for it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that before that time we &s;hould be ma&s;ters of <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> We had not rowed above 2 mile, before we met and took one of the three Barks laden with Negroes; the Ma&s;ter of her &s;aid, that the other two would come from <HI>Guiaquil</HI> the next Tide of Ebb. We cut her Main-ma&s;t down, and left her at an Anchor. It was now &s;trong Flood, and therefore we rowed with all &s;peed to|wards the Town, in hopes to get thither before the Flood was down, but we found it farther than we did expect it to be, or el&s;e our Canoas being very full of men, did not row &s;o fa&s;t as we would have them. The day broke when we were two leagues
<PB N="155" REF="177">
from the Town, and then we had not above an hours Flood more; therefore our Captains de&s;ired the <HI>Indian</HI> Pilot to direct us to &s;ome Creek where we might ab&s;cond all day, which was immediately done, and one Canoa was &s;ent toward <HI>Puna</HI> to our Bark, to order them not to move nor fire till the next day. But &s;he came too late to countermand the fir&s;t orders; for the two Barks before mentioned laden with Negroes, came from the Town the la&s;t quarter of the evening Tide, and lay in the River, clo&s;e by the &s;hoar on one &s;ide, and we rowed upon the other &s;ide and mi&s;t them; neither did they &s;ee nor hear us. A&s;&s;oon as the Flood was &s;pent, the two Barks weighed and went down with the Ebb, towards <HI>Puna.</HI> Our Bark &s;eeing them coming di|rectly towards them, and both full of men, &s;uppo&s;ed that we by &s;ome Accident had been de&s;troyed, and that the two Barks were Mann'd with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sol|diers, and &s;ent to take our Ships, and therefore they fired 3 Guns at them a league before they came near. The two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Barks immediately came to an Anchor, and the Ma&s;ters got into their Boats, and rowed for the &s;hoar; but our Canoa that was &s;ent from us took them both. The firing of the&s;e 3 Guns made a great di&s;order among our advanced Men, for mo&s;t of them did believe they were heard at <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> and that therefore it could be no profit to lie &s;till in the Creek; but either row away to the Town, or back again to our Ships. It was now quarter ebb, therefore we could not move upwards, if we had been di&s;pos'd &s;o to do. At length Captain <HI>Davis</HI> &s;aid, he would immediately land in the Creek where they lay, and march directly to the Town, if but 40 Men would accompany him: and without &s;aying more words, he landed among the Mangroves in the Mar&s;hes. Tho&s;e that were &s;o minded followed him, to the number of 40 or 50. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> lay &s;till with the re&s;t of the Party in the Creek,
<PB N="156" REF="178">
for they thought it impo&s;&s;ible to do any good that way. Captain <HI>Davis</HI> and his Men were ab&s;ent about 4 hours, and then returned all wet, and quite tired, and could not find any pa&s;&s;age out into the firm Land. He had been &s;o far, that he almo&s;t de&s;pair'd of getting back again: for a Man cannot pa&s;s thro' tho&s;e red Mangroves but with very much labour. When Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> was return'd, we concluded to be going towards the Town the beginning of the next flood; and if we found that the Town was alarm'd we purpo&s;ed to return again without attempting any thing there. As &s;oon as it was flood we rowed away, and pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land thro' the N. E. Channel, which is the narrowe&s;t. There are &s;o many Stumps in the River, that it is very dangerous pa&s;&s;ing in the night (and that is the time we always take for &s;uch Attempts) for the River runs very &s;wift, and one of our Canoas &s;tuck on a &s;tump, and had certainly over-&s;et, if &s;he had not been immediately re&s;cued by others. When we were come almo&s;t to the end of the I&s;land, there was a Mu&s;quet fired at us out of the Bu&s;hes on the Main. We then had the Town open before us, and pre&s;ently &s;aw lighted Torches, or Candles, all the Town over; whereas before the Gun was fired there was but one Light: there|fore we now concluded we were di&s;covered: Yet many of our Men &s;aid, that it was a Holy-day the next day, as it was indeed, and that therefore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were making Fire-works, which they often do in the night again&s;t &s;uch times. We rowed there-fore a little farther, and found firm Land, and Cap|tain <HI>Davis</HI> pitch'd his Canoa a&s;hore and landed with his Men. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and mo&s;t of his Men, did not think it convenient to attempt any thing, &s;eeing the Town was alarmed; but at la&s;t, being upbraided with Cowardize, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Men landed al&s;o. The place where we landed was about 2 mile from the Town: it was all over-grown with Woods
<PB N="157" REF="179">
&s;o thick, that we could not march through in the Night; and therefore we &s;at down, waiting for the light of the Day. We had two <HI>Indian</HI> Pilots with us; one that had been with us a Month, who having re|ceived &s;ome Abu&s;es from a Gentleman of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> to be revenged offered his Service to us; and we found him very faithful: The other was taken by us not above 2 or 3 days before, and he &s;eemed to be as willing as the other to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. This latter was led by one of Captain <HI>Davis</HI>'s Men, who &s;hewed him&s;elf very forward to go to the Town, and up|braided others with faint-heartedne&s;s: Yet this Man (as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed) notwith&s;tanding his Courage privately cut the String that the Guide was made fa&s;t with, and let him go to the Town by him&s;elf, not caring to follow him; but when he thought the Guide was got far enough from us, he cried out that the Pilot was gone, and that &s;ome Body had cut the Cord that tied him. This put every Man in a moving Po&s;ture to &s;eek the <HI>Indian,</HI> but all in vain; and our Con&s;ternation was great being in the dark and among Woods; &s;o the de&s;ign was wholly da&s;hed, for not a Man after that had the heart to &s;peak of going farther. Here we &s;taid till day, and then rowed out into the middle of the River, where we had a fair view of the Town; which, as I &s;aid before, makes a very plea&s;ant pro&s;|pect. We lay &s;till about half an hour, being a mile, or &s;omething better, from the Town. They did not fire one Gun at us, nor we at them. Thus our de&s;ign on <HI>Guiaquil</HI> fail'd: yet Captain <HI>Townely,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Francois Gronet</HI> took it a little while after this. When we had taken a full view of the Town, we rowed over the River, where we went a&s;hore to a Beef E&s;tantion or Farm, and kill'd a Cow, which we dre&s;t and eat. We &s;taid there till the Evening Tide of Ebb, and then rowed down the River, and the 9th day in the Morning arrived at <HI>Pima.</HI> In our
<PB N="158" REF="180">
way thither we went aboard the 3 Barks laden with Negroes, that lay at their Anchor in the River, and carried the Barks away with us. There were 1000 Negroes in 3 Barks, all lu&s;ty young Men and Women. When we came to <HI>Puna,</HI> we &s;ent a Canoa to Point <HI>Arena,</HI> to &s;ee if the Ships were come thither. The 12th day &s;he returned again, with tydings that they were both there at Anchor. There|fore in the Afternoon we all went aboard of our Ships, and carry'd the Cloth-Bark with us, and about 40 of the &s;toute&s;t Negro-Men, leaving their 3 Barks with the re&s;t; and out of the&s;e al&s;o Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> cho&s;e about 14 or 15 a-piece, and turn'd the re&s;t a&s;hore.</P>
<P>There was never a greater oportunity put into the Hands of Men to enrich them&s;elves than we had; to have gone with the&s;e Negroes and &s;ettled our &s;elves at <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> on the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> and employed them in getting Gold out of the Mines there. Which might have been done with ea&s;e: For about 6 Months before this, Capt. <HI>Har|ris</HI> (who was now with us) coming over Land from the <HI>North Seas,</HI> with his Body of Privateers, had routed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> away from the Town and Gold-Mines of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> &s;o that they had never attempted to &s;ettle there again &s;ince: Add to this, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Neighbourhood, who were mortal Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and had been flu&s;ht by their Succe&s;&s;es again&s;t them, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Privateers, for &s;everal years, were our fa&s;t Friends, and ready to receive and a&s;&s;i&s;t us. We had, as I have &s;aid, 1000 Negroes to work for us, we had 200 Tun of Flower that lay at the <HI>Gallapagos,</HI> there was the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> where we could careen and fit our Ships; and might fortifie the mouth &s;o, that if all the &s;trength the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> had come again&s;t us, we could have kept them out. If they lay with Guard-&s;hips of Strength to keep us
<PB N="159" REF="181">
in, yet we had a great Country to live in, and a great Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> that were our Friends: Be|&s;ide, which was the principal thing, we had the <HI>North Seas</HI> to befriend us; from whence we could export our &s;elves, or Effects, or import Goods or Men to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for in a &s;hort time we &s;hould have had a&s;&s;i&s;tance from all parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> many thou&s;ands of Privateers from <HI>Jamaica</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands e&s;pecially would have flockt over to us; and long before this time we might have been Ma&s;ters not only of tho&s;e Mines, (the riche&s;t Gold-Mines ever yet found in <HI>America</HI>) but of all the Coa&s;t as high as <HI>Quito:</HI> And much more than I &s;ay might then probably have been done.</P>
<P>But the&s;e may &s;eem to the Reader but Golden Dreams: To leave them therefore; The 13th day we &s;ailed from Point <HI>Arena</HI> towards <HI>Plata,</HI> to &s;eek our Bark that was &s;ent to the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> in &s;earch of Captain <HI>Eaton.</HI> We were 2 Ships in Company, and 2 Barks; and the 16th day we arrived at <HI>Plata,</HI> but found no Bark there, nor any Letter. The next day we went over to the Main to fill Water, and in our Pa&s;&s;age met our Bark: She had been a &s;econd time at the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> and not finding us, was coming to <HI>Plata</HI> again. They had been in &s;ome want of Provi&s;ion &s;ince they left us, and therefore they had been at <HI>Santa Hellena,</HI> and taken it; where they got as much Maize as &s;erved them 3 or 4 days; and that, with &s;ome Fi&s;h and Turtle which they &s;truck, la&s;ted them till they came to the I&s;land <HI>Lobos de Terra.</HI> They got Boobies and Penguins Eggs; of which they laid in a &s;tore; and went from thence to <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> where they repleni&s;hed their &s;tock of Eggs, and &s;alted up a few young Seal, for fear they &s;hould want: And being thus victualled, they returned again towards <HI>Plata.</HI> When our Water was fill'd, we went over again to the I&s;land <HI>Plata.</HI> There we parted the Cloths that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re taken in the
<PB N="160" REF="182">
Cloth-Bark into two Lots or Shares; Captain <HI>Da|vis</HI> and his Men had one part, and Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Men had the other part. The Bark which the Cloth was in, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> kept for a Tender. At this time here were at <HI>Plata</HI> a great many large Turtles, which I judge came from the <HI>Gallapago's,</HI> for I had never &s;een any here before, tho' I had been here &s;everal times: This was their Coupling-time, which is much &s;ooner in the Year here than in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> properly &s;o called. Our Strikers brought aboard every day more than we could eat. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had no Striker, and therefore had no Turtle but what was &s;ent him from Captain <HI>Davis;</HI> and all his Flower too he had from Captain <HI>Davis:</HI> But &s;ince our Di&s;appointment at <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s Men murmured again&s;t Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and did not willingly give him any Provi&s;ion, becau&s;e he was not &s;o forward to go thither as Capt. <HI>Davis.</HI> How|ever, at la&s;t, the&s;e differences were made up, and we concluded to go into the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> to a Town called <HI>La Velia;</HI> but becau&s;e we had not Ca|noas enough to land our Men, we were re&s;olved to &s;earch &s;ome Rivers where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Commerce, there to get <HI>Indian</HI> Canoas.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE 23d day of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1684. we &s;ailed from the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> towards the Bay of <HI>Panama:</HI> The Wind at S. S. E. a fine bri&s;k gale, and fine Wea|ther. The next morning we pa&s;t by Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao.</HI> This Cape is in lat. 00 d. 08 m. South of the Equa|tor. It runs out into the Sea with a high round Point, which &s;eems to be divided in the mid&s;t. It is bald again&s;t the Sea, but within Land, and on both &s;ides, it is full of &s;hort Trees. The Land in the Country is very high and Mountainous, and it ap|pears to be very woody. Between Cape <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao</HI> and Cape <HI>St Franci&s;co,</HI> the Land by the Sea is full of &s;mall Points, making as many little &s;andy Bays between them; and is of an indifferent heighth,
<PB N="163" REF="185">
covered with Trees of divers &s;orts; &s;o that &s;ailing by this Coa&s;t you &s;ee nothing but a va&s;t Grove or Wood, which is &s;o much the more plea&s;ant, becau&s;e the Trees are of &s;everal Forms, both in re&s;pect to their Growth and Colour.</P>
<P>Our de&s;ign was, as I &s;aid in my fir&s;t Chapter, to &s;earch for Canoas in &s;ome River where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have neither Settlement nor Trade with the native <HI>Indians.</HI> We had <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pilots, and <HI>Indians</HI> bred un|der the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were able to carry us into any Harbour or River belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but were wholly unacquainted with tho&s;e Rivers which were not frequented by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> There are many &s;uch un&s;requented Rivers between <HI>Plata</HI> and <HI>Panama:</HI> Indeed all the way from the Line to the Gulph of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> or even to <HI>Panama</HI> it &s;elf, the Coa&s;t is not inhabited by any <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor are the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabit there any way un|der their &s;ubjection: except only near the I&s;le <HI>Gal|lo,</HI> where, on the Banks of a Gold River or two, there are &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> who work there to find Gold.</P>
<P>Now our Pilots being at a lo&s;s on the&s;e le&s;s fre|quented Coa&s;ts, we &s;upply'd that defect out of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pilot-books, which we took in their Ships: The&s;e we found by experience to be very good Guides. Yet neverthele&s;s the Country in many Places by the Sea being low, and full of openings, Creeks and Rivers, it is &s;omewhat difficult to find any particular River that a Man de&s;igns to go to, where he is not well acquainted.</P>
<P>This however could be no di&s;couragement to us; for one River might probably be as well furni&s;hed with <HI>Indian</HI> Canoas as another; and if we found them, it was to us indifferent where, yet we pitcht on the River <HI>St. Jago,</HI> not becau&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> were not other Rivers as large, and as likely to be inhabited with <HI>Indians</HI> as it; but becau&s;e that River was not far from <HI>Gallo,</HI> an I&s;land where our Ships could an|chor
<PB N="164" REF="186">
&s;afely and ride &s;ecurely. We pa&s;t by Cape St. <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> meeting with great and continued Rains. The Land by the Sea to the North of the Cape, is low and extraordinary woody; the Trees are very thick, and &s;eem to be of a prodigious height and bigne&s;s. From Cape St. <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> the Land runs more Ea&s;terly into the Bay of <HI>Panama.</HI> I take this Cape to be its Bounds on the South &s;ide, and the I&s;les of <HI>Cobaya</HI> or <HI>Quibo</HI> to bound it on the N. &s;ide. Between this Cape and the I&s;le <HI>Gallo,</HI> there are many large and navigable Rivers. We pa&s;&s;ed by them all till we came to the River St <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>This River is near 2 d. North of the Equator. It is large and navigable &s;ome leagues up, and 7 leagues from the Sea it divides it &s;elf into two parts, making an I&s;land that is 4 leagues wide again&s;t the Sea. The wide&s;t branch is that on the S. W. &s;ide of the I&s;land. Both Branches are very deep, but the Mouth of the narrower is &s;o choakt with &s;holes, that at low wa|ter, even Canoas can't enter. Above the I&s;land it is a league wide and the Stream runs pretty &s;traight, and very &s;wift. The Tide flows about 3 leagues up the River, but to what heighth I know not. Probably the River hath its Original from &s;ome of the Rich Mountains near the City <HI>Quito,</HI> and it runs through a Country, as rich in Soil, as perhaps any in the World, e&s;pecially when it draws within 10 or 12 leagues of the Sea. The Land there both on the I&s;land, and on the both &s;ides of the River, is of a black deep Mold, producing extraordinary great tall Trees of many &s;orts, &s;uch as u&s;ually grow in the&s;e hot Climates. I &s;hall only give an account of the <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Cabbage-trees,</HI> whereof there is great plenty; and they are as large of their kinds as ever I &s;aw.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Cotton-trees,</HI> one is call'd the Red, the other the White <HI>Cotton-tree.</HI> The white <HI>Cotton-tree</HI> grows like an Oak, but generally
<PB N="165" REF="187">
much bigger and taller than our Oaks: The body is &s;traight and clear from knots or boughs to the very head: there it &s;preads forth many great Limbs ju&s;t like an Oak. The Bark is &s;mooth and of a grey co|lour: the Leaves are as big as a large Plumb Leaf, jagged at the edge; they are oval, &s;mooth, and of a dark green colour. Some of the&s;e Trees have their bodies much bigger, 18 or 20 foot high, than nearer the ground, being big bellied like Nine-pins. They bear a very fine &s;ort of Cotton, called Silk Cotton. When this Cotton is ripe the Trees appear like our Apple-trees in <HI>England,</HI> when full of Blo&s;&s;oms. If I do not mi&s;take, the Cotton falls down in <HI>November</HI> or <HI>December:</HI> then the Ground is covered white with it. This is not &s;ub&s;tantial and continuous, like that which grows upon the Cotton-&s;hrubs, in Plantati|ons, but like the Down of Thi&s;tles; &s;o that I did never know any u&s;e made of it in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> be|cau&s;e it is not worth the Labour of gathering it: but in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> the Natives gather and u&s;e it for Pillows. It hath a &s;mall black Seed among it. The Leaves of this Tree fall off the begining of <HI>April;</HI> while the old Leaves are falling off the young ones &s;pring out, and in a weeks time the Tree ca&s;ts off her old Robes, and is cloathed in a new plea&s;ant Garb. The red Cotton-tree is like the other, but hardly &s;o big: it bears no Cotton, but its Wood is &s;omewhat harder of the two, yet both &s;orts are &s;oft &s;pungy Wood, fit for no u&s;e that I know, but only for Canoas, which being &s;traight and tall they are very good for; but they will not la&s;t long, e&s;pe|cially if not drawn a&s;hoar often and tarred; other|wi&s;e the Worm and the Water &s;oon rot them. They are the bigge&s;t Trees, or perhaps Weeds rather, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> They are common in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> in good fat Land.</P>
<P>As the Cotton is the bigge&s;t Tree in the Woods, &s;o the Cabbage-tree is the talle&s;t: The Body is not
<PB N="166" REF="188">
very big, but very high and &s;traight. I have mea|&s;ured one in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy</HI> 120 feet long as it lay on the Ground, and there are &s;ome much higher. It has no Limbs nor Boughs, but at the head there are many Branches bigger than a Man's Arm. The&s;e Branches are not cover'd, but flat, with Sharp edges; they are 12 or 14 foot long. A|bout two foot from the Trunk, the Branches &s;hoot forth &s;mall long Leaves, about aninch broad, which grow &s;o regularly on both &s;ides of the Branch, that the whole Branch &s;eems to be but one Leaf, made up of many &s;mall ones. The Cabbage fruit &s;hoots out in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Branches, from the top of the Tree: it is inve&s;ted with many young Leaves or Branches which are ready to &s;pread abroad, as the old Branches drop and fall down. The Cabbage it &s;elf, when it is taken out of the Leaves which it &s;eems to be folded in, is as big as the &s;mall of a Man's Leg, and a foot long; it is as white as Milk, and as &s;weet as a Nut, if eaten raw, and it is very &s;weet and whole&s;om if boiled. Be&s;ides, the Cab|bage it &s;elf, there grow out between the Cabbage and the large Bran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, &s;mall twigs, as of a Shrub, about two foot long from their Stump. At the end of tho&s;e twigs (which grows very thick together) there hang Berries, hard and round, and as big as a Cherry. The&s;e the Trees &s;hed every year, and they are very good for Hogs: for this rea&s;on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fine any who &s;hall cut down any of the&s;e in their Woods. The Body of the Tree is full of rings round it, half a foot a&s;under from the bottom to the top. The Bark is thin and brittle; the Wood is black and very hard, the heart or middle of the Tree is white Pith. They do not climb to get the Cabbage, but cut them down; for &s;hould they ga|ther it off the Tree as it &s;tands, yet its head being gone it &s;oon dies. The&s;e Trees are much u&s;ed by Planters in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to board the &s;ides of the Hou&s;es

for it is but &s;plitting the Trunk into 4 parts with an Axe, and there are &s;o many Planks. Tho&s;e Trees appear very plea&s;ant, and they beautifie the whole Wood, &s;preading their green Branches above all other Trees.</P>
<P>All this Country is &s;ubject to very great Rains, &s;o that this part of <HI>Peru</HI> pays for the dry weather which they have about <HI>Lima</HI> and all that Coa&s;t. I believe that is one rea&s;on why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made &s;uch &s;mall di&s;coveries, in this and other Rivers on this Coa&s;t. Another rea&s;on may be, becau&s;e it lies not &s;o directly in their way; for they do not Coa&s;t it a|long in going from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Lima,</HI> but fir&s;t go We&s;t|ward as far as to the Keys or I&s;les of <HI>Cobaya,</HI> for a We&s;terly wind, and from thence &s;tand over towards Cape <HI>St. Franci&s;co,</HI> not touching any where u&s;ually till they come to <HI>Manta</HI> near Cape St. <HI>Lorenzo.</HI> In their return indeed from <HI>Lima</HI> to <HI>Panama,</HI> they may keep along the Coa&s;t hereabouts; but then their Ships are always laden, whereas the light Ships that go from <HI>Panama,</HI> are mo&s;t at lei&s;ure to make di&s;co|veries. A third rea&s;on may be the wildne&s;s and enmity of all the Natives on this Coa&s;t, who are naturally fortified by their Rivers and va&s;t Woods, from whence with their Arrows they can ea&s;ily an|noy any that &s;hall land there to a&s;&s;ault them. At this River particularly there are no <HI>Indians</HI> live with|in 6 leagues of the Sea, and all the Country &s;o far is full of impa&s;&s;able Woods, &s;o that to get at the <HI>Indians,</HI> or the Mines and Mountains, there is no way but by rowing up the River; and if any who are Enemies to the Natives attempt this, (as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are always hated by them) they mu&s;t all the way be expo&s;ed to the Arrows of tho&s;e who would lie purpo&s;ely in Ambu&s;h in the Woods for them. The&s;e wild <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;mall Plantations of Maiz, and good Plantain-Gardens; for Plantains are their chiefe&s;t food. They have al&s;o a few Fowls and Hogs.</P>

It was to this River that we were bound to &s;eek, for Canoas, therefore the 26th &s;uppo&s;ing our &s;elves to be abre&s;t of it, we went from our Ships with 4 Canoas. The 27th day in the Morning we entered at half Flood into the &s;maller branch of that River, and rowed up 6 leagues before we met any Inhabitants. There we found two &s;mall Huts thatched with <HI>Pal|meto</HI> Leaves. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eeing us rowing towards their Hou&s;es, got their Wives and little ones, with their Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, into their Canoas, and paddled away fa&s;ter than we could row; for we were forced to keep in the middle of the River becau&s;e of our Oars, but they with their Paddles kept clo&s;e under the Banks, and &s;o had not the &s;trength of the &s;tream again&s;t them, as we had. The&s;e Huts were clo&s;e by the River on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it, ju&s;t again&s;t the end of the I&s;land. We &s;aw a great many other Hou&s;es a league from us on the other &s;ide of the Ri|ver; but the main &s;tream into which we were now come, &s;eemed to be &s;o &s;wift, that we were afraid to put over, for fear we &s;hould not be abe to get back again. We found only a Hog, &s;ome Fowls and Plantains, in the Huts: We killed the Hog and the Fowls, which were dre&s;t pre&s;ently. Their Hogs they got (as I &s;uppo&s;e) from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by &s;ome accident, or from &s;ome Neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI> who conver&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for this that we took was of their <HI>European</HI> kind, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have introduced into <HI>America</HI> very plentifully, e&s;pecially into the I&s;lands <HI>Jamaica, Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> above all, being very largely &s;tored with them where they feed in the Woods in the day time, and at night come in at the &s;ounding of a <HI>Conch-&s;hell,</HI> and are put up in their Crauls or Pens, and yet &s;ome turn wild, which neverthele&s;s are often decoy|ed in by the other, which being all marked, when|ever they &s;ee an unmarked Hog in the Pen they know it is a wild one, and &s;hoot him pre&s;ently.

<P>After we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we returned towards the Mouth of the River. It was the even|ing when we came from thence, and we got to the Rivers Mouth the next Morning before Day: Our Ships when we left them were order'd to go to <HI>Gal|lo,</HI> where they were to &s;tay for us. <HI>Gallo</HI> is a &s;mall uninhabited I&s;land, lying in between two and 3 De|grees North Lat.

The Road for Ships is again&s;t this Bay, where there is good &s;ecure riding in 6 or 7 fathom Water; and here Ships may careen. It is but &s;hoal Water all about this I&s;land; yet there is a Channel to come in at, where there is no le&s;s than 4 fathom Water: You mu&s;t go in with the Tide of Flood, and come out with Ebb, &s;ounding all the way.</P>
<P><HI>Tomaco</HI> is a large River that takes its Name from an <HI>Indian</HI> Village &s;o called: It is reported to &s;pring from the rich Mountains about <HI>Quito.</HI> It is thick inhabited with <HI>Indians;</HI> and there are &s;ome <HI>Spani|ards</HI> that live there, who traffick with the <HI>Indians</HI> for Gold.

<P><PB N="170" REF="192">
This Village <HI>Tomaco</HI> is but &s;mall, and is &s;eated not far from the Mouth of the River.

At this place one <HI>Doleman,</HI> with 7 or 8 Men more, once of Captain <HI>Sharp's</HI> Crew, were killed in the year 1680.

The Ship was riding in a Creek about a mile off, and there were only one <HI>Spaniard</HI> and 8 <HI>Indians</HI> aboard. We went in a Ca|noa with 7 Men and took her; &s;he had no Goods, but 12 or 13 Jars of good Wine, which we took out, and the next day let the Ship go. Here an <HI>Indian</HI> Canoa came aboard with three Men in her.

I&s;land that it rains on every day in the Year more or le&s;s; but that I can di&s;prove: However, it is a very wet Coa&s;t, and it rains abundantly here all the Year long.

It is fenced with Rocks again&s;t the Sea. Within the Point, by the Sea, at low Water, you may find &s;tore of Oy&s;ters and Mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kings I&s;lands,</HI> or <HI>Pearl Keys,</HI> are about 12 leagues di&s;tant from this Point. Between Point <HI>Gara|china</HI> and them, there is a &s;mall low flat barren I&s;land
<PB N="175" REF="197">
called <HI>Gallera,</HI> at which Captain <HI>Harris</HI> was &s;haring with his Men the Gold he took in his pillaging <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> which I &s;pake of a little before, when on a &s;udden 5 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Barks, fitted out on purpo&s;e at <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> came upon him; but he fought them &s;o &s;toutly with one &s;mall Bark he had, and &s;ome few Canoas, boarding their Admiral particularly, that they were all glad to leave him. By this I&s;land we anchored and &s;ent our Boats to the <HI>Kings I&s;land</HI> for a good careening place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> are a great many low Woody I&s;lands, lying N. W. by N. and S. E. by S. They are about 7 leagues from the Main, and 14 leagues in length, and from <HI>Panama</HI> about 12 leagues. Why they are called the <HI>Kings I&s;lands,</HI> I know not; they are &s;ometimes and mo&s;tly in Maps, called the <HI>Pearl I&s;lands.</HI> I cannot imagine wherefore they are called &s;o, for I did never &s;ee one Pearl Oy&s;ter about them, nor any Pearl Oy&s;ter-&s;hells; but on the other Oy|&s;ters I have made many a Meal there: The Norther-mo&s;t I&s;land of all this range is called <HI>Pachea,</HI> or <HI>Pa|cheque.</HI> This is but a &s;mall I&s;land, di&s;tant from <HI>Pa|nama</HI> 11 or 12 leagues. The Southermo&s;t of them is called <HI>St. Pauls.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e two I know no more that are called by any particular Name, tho' there are many that far exceed either of the two in big|ne&s;s. Some of the&s;e I&s;lands are planted with Plan|tains and Bonanas; and there are Fields of Rice on others of them. The Gentlemen of <HI>Panama,</HI> to whom they belong, keep Negroes there to plant, Weed, and Hu&s;band the Plantations. Many of them, e&s;pecially the large&s;t, are wholly untill'd, yet very good fat land, full of large Trees. The&s;e unplanted I&s;lands &s;helter many Runaway-Negroes, who ab&s;cond in the Woods all day, and in the night boldly pillage the Plantain Walks. Betwixt the&s;e I&s;lands and the Main is a Channel of 7 or 8 leagues wide; there is good depth of Water, and good Anchoring all the
<PB N="176" REF="198">
way. The I&s;lands border thick on each other; yet they make many &s;mall narrow deep Channels, fit only for Boats to pa&s;s between mo&s;t of them. At the S. E. end, about a league from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s I&s;land, there is a good place for Ships to careen, or hale a&s;hore It is &s;urrounded with the Land, and hath a good deep Channel on the North &s;ide to go in at. The Tide ri&s;eth here about 10 foot perpendicular.</P>
<P>We brought our Ships into this place the 25th day, but were forced to tarry for a Spring Tide before we could have Water enough to clean them; there|fore we fir&s;t clean'd our Barks, that they might crui&s;e before <HI>Panama,</HI> while we lay here. The 27th day our Barks being clean we &s;ent them out with 20 Men in each. The 4th day after, they returned with a Prize laden with Maiz, or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Salt-Beef and Fowls. She came from <HI>Lavelia,</HI> and was bound to <HI>Panama. Lavelia</HI> is a Town we once de|&s;igned to attempt. It is pretty large, and &s;tands on the Bank of a River on the North &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> 6 or 7 leagues from the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Nata</HI> is another &s;uch Town &s;tanding in a Plain near another Branch of the &s;ame River. In the&s;e Towns, and &s;ome others on the &s;ame Coa&s;t, they breed Hogs, Fowls, Bulls and Cows, and plant Maiz purpo&s;ely for the &s;upport of <HI>Panama,</HI> which is &s;up|plied with Provi&s;ion mo&s;tly from other Towns and the Neigbouring I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Beef and Fowl our Men took, came to us in a good time, for we had eaten but little Fle&s;h &s;ince we left the I&s;land <HI>Plata.</HI> The Harbour where we careen'd was incompa&s;&s;ed by three I&s;lands, and our Ships rode in the middle. That on which we haled our Ships a&s;hore, was a little I&s;land on the North &s;ide of the Harbour. There was a fine &s;mall &s;andy Bay, but all the re&s;t of the I&s;land was invironed with Rocks, on which at low Water we did u&s;e to gather Oy|&s;ters, Clams, Mu&s;cles and Limpits. The Clam is
<PB N="177" REF="199">
a &s;ort of Oy&s;ter which grows &s;o fa&s;t to the Rock, that there is no &s;eparating it from thence, therefore we did open it where it grows, and take out the Meat, which is very large, fat and &s;weet. Here are a few common Oy&s;ters, &s;uch as we have in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> of which &s;ort I have met with none in the&s;e Seas, but here, at Point <HI>Garachina,</HI> at <HI>Puna,</HI> and on the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t, in the lat. of 23 d. North. I have a Manu&s;cript of Mr. <HI>Teat,</HI> Capt. <HI>Swan</HI>'s chief Mate, which gives an account of Oy&s;ters plenti|fully found in Port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide and &s;omewhat to the North of the Streights of <HI>Magel|lan;</HI> but there is no mention made of what Oy&s;ters they are. Here are &s;ome Guanoes but we found no other &s;ort of Land-Animal. Here are al&s;o &s;ome Pigeons and Turtle-Doves. The re&s;t of the I&s;lands that incompa&s;s this Harbour had of all the&s;e &s;orts of Creatures. Our Men therefore did every day go over in Canoas to them to Fi&s;h, Fowl or Hunt for Guanoes; but having one Man &s;urprized once by &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> lying there in ambu&s;h, and carried off by them to <HI>Panama,</HI> we were after that more cauti|ous of &s;traggling.</P>
<P>The 14th day of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1685. we made an end of cleaning our Ship, fill'd all our Water, and &s;tock'd our &s;elves with Fire-wood. The 15th day we went out from among the I&s;lands, and anchored in the Channel between them and the Main, in 25 fathom Water, &s;oft Oazy Ground. The Plate-Fleet was not yet arrived; therefore we intended to crui&s;e before the City of <HI>Panama,</HI> which is from this place about 25 leagues. The next day we &s;ailed towards <HI>Pana|ma,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing in the Channel between the <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> and the Main. It is very plea&s;ant &s;ailing here, ha|ving the Main on one &s;ide, which appears in divers forms. It is beautified with many &s;mall Hills, cloath'd with woods of divers &s;orts of Trees, which are al|ways green and flouri&s;hing. There are &s;ome few
<PB N="178" REF="200">
&s;mall high I&s;lands within a league of the Main, &s;cat|tering here and there one: The&s;e are partly Woody, partly bare; and they, as well as the Main, appear very plea&s;ant. The <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> are on the other &s;ide of this Channel, and make al&s;o a lovely pro&s;|pect as you &s;ail by them. The&s;e, as I have already noted, are low and flat, appearing in &s;everal Shapes, according as they are naturally formed by many &s;mall Creeks and Branches of the Sea. The 16th day we anchored at <HI>Pacheque,</HI> in 17 fathom Water, about a leagne from the I&s;land, and &s;ailed from thence the next day, with the Wind at N. N. E. directing our cour&s;e towards <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>When we came abre&s;t of <HI>Old Panama</HI> we anchor'd, and &s;ent our Canoa a&s;hore with our Pri&s;oner Don <HI>Diego de Pinas,</HI> with a Letter to the Governour, to treat about an Exchange for our Man they had &s;pi|rited away, as I &s;aid; and another Captain <HI>Harris</HI> left in the River of <HI>St. Maria</HI> the year before, coming over Land. Don <HI>Diego</HI> was de&s;irous to go on this Errand in the Name, and with the Con&s;ent of the re&s;t of our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners; but by &s;ome accident he was killed before he got a&s;hore, as we heard afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Old Panama</HI> was formerly a famous place, but it was taken by Sir <HI>Henry Morgan</HI> about the year 1673. and at that time great part of it was burned to A&s;hes, and it was never re-edified &s;ince.</P>
<P><HI>New Panama</HI> is a very fair City, &s;tanding clo&s;e by the Sea, about 4 Mile from the Ruines of the Old Town. It gives Name to a large Bay which is fa|mous for a great many navigable Rivers, &s;ome where|of are very rich in Gold; it is al&s;o very plea&s;antly &s;prinkled with I&s;lands, that are not only profitable to their Owners, but very delightful to the Pa&s;|&s;engers and Seamen that &s;ail by them; &s;ome of which I have already de&s;cribed. It is incompa&s;&s;ed on the back&s;ide with a plea&s;ant Country, which is full of &s;mall Hills and Valleys, beautified with many
<PB N="179" REF="201">
Groves and Spots of Trees, that appear in the Sa|vannahs like &s;o many little I&s;lands. This City is all compa&s;&s;ed with a high Stone Wall; the Hou&s;es are &s;aid to be of Brick. Their Roofs appear higher than the top of the City Wall. It is beautified with a great many fair Churches and Religious Hou&s;es, be|&s;ides the Pre&s;idents Hou&s;e, and other eminent Build|ings; which altogether make one of the fine&s;t objects that I did ever &s;ee, in <HI>America</HI> e&s;pecially. There are a great many Guns on her Walls, mo&s;t of which look toward the Land. They had none at all again&s;t the Sea, when I fir&s;t entred tho&s;e Seas with Captain <HI>Sawkins,</HI> Captain <HI>Coxon,</HI> Captain <HI>Sharp,</HI> and others; for till then they did not fear any Enemy by Sea: but &s;ince then they have planted Guns clear round. This is a flouri&s;hing City by rea&s;on it is a thorough|fair for all imported or exported Goods and Trea|&s;ure, to and from all Parts of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili;</HI> whereof their Store-Hou&s;es are never empty. The Road al&s;o is &s;eldom or never without Ships. Be&s;ides once in 3 years, when the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armada comes to <HI>Portobel,</HI> then the Plate-Fleet al&s;o from <HI>Lima</HI> comes hither with the King's Trea&s;ure, and abundance of Merchant Ships full of Goods and Plate; at that time the City is full of Merchants and Gentlemen; the Seamen are bu&s;ie in landing the Trea&s;ure and Goods, and the Carriers, or Caravan Ma&s;ters, im|ployed in carrying it over land on Mules (in va&s;t droves every day) to <HI>Portobel,</HI> and bringing back <HI>European</HI> Goods from thence: Tho' the City be then &s;o full, yet during this heat of Bu&s;ine&s;s there is no hiring of an ordinary Slave under a Piece of Eight a day; Hou&s;es, al&s;o Chambers, Beds and Victuals are then extraordinary dear.</P>
<P>Now I am on this Subject, I think it will not be ami&s;s to give the Reader an account of the Progre&s;s of the Armada from <HI>Old Spain,</HI> which comes thus every three Years into the <HI>Indies.</HI> Its fir&s;t arrival is
<PB N="180" REF="202">
at <HI>Carthagena,</HI> from whence, as I have been told, an Expre&s;s is immediately &s;ent over Land to <HI>Lima,</HI> thro' the Southern Continent, and another by Sea to <HI>Porto|bel,</HI> with two Pacquets of Letters, one for the Vice-roy of <HI>Lima,</HI> the other for the Vice-roy of <HI>Mexico.</HI> I know not which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that of <HI>Mexico</HI> goes after its arrival at <HI>Portobel,</HI> whether by land or Sea: But I believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a to <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI> That for <HI>Lima</HI> is &s;ent by Land to <HI>Panama,</HI> and from thence by Sea to <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>Upon mention of the&s;e Pacquets I &s;hall digre&s;s yet a little further, and acquaint my Reader, that before my fir&s;t going over into the <HI>South Seas</HI> with Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> (and indeed before any Privateers (at lea&s;t &s;ince <HI>Drake</HI> and <HI>Oxengham</HI>) had gone that way which we afterwards went, except <HI>La Sound,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Cap|tain, who by Captain <HI>Wright</HI>'s In&s;tructions had ven|tured as far as <HI>Cheapo</HI> Town with a Body of Men, but was driven back again) I being then on board Capt. <HI>Coxen,</HI> in company with 3 or 4 more Privateers, about 4 leagues to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Portobel,</HI> we took the Pacquets bound thither from <HI>Carthagena.</HI> We open'd a great quantity of the Merchants Letters, and found the Contents of many of them to be very &s;urprizing, the Merchants of &s;everal parts of <HI>Old Spain</HI> thereby in|forming there Corre&s;pondents of <HI>Panama,</HI> and el&s;e|where, of a certain Prophecy that went about <HI>Spain</HI> that year, the Tenour of which was, <HI>That there would be</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Privateers that Year in the</HI> We&s;t-In|dies, <HI>who would make &s;uch great Di&s;coveries, as to open a Door into the</HI> South Seas; which they &s;up+po&s;ed was fa&s;te&s;t &s;hut: And the Letters were accor+dingly full of Cautions to their Friends to be very watchful and careful of their Coa&s;ts.</P>

time they had with them: and upon calling al|&s;o to mind the frequent Invitations we had from tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> a little before this time, to pa&s;s through their Country, and fall upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> we from hence forward began to enter|tain &s;uch thoughts in earne&s;t, and &s;oon came to a Re&s;olution to make tho&s;e Attempts which we after|wards did, with Capt. <HI>Sharp, Coxen, &amp;c.</HI> So that the taking the&s;e Letters gave the fir&s;t life to tho&s;e bold Undertakings: and we took the advantage of the fears the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in from that Prophecy, or probable Conjecture, or whatever it were; for we &s;ealed up mo&s;t of the Letters again, and &s;ent them a&s;hoar to <HI>Portobel.</HI></P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this our late Friend&s;hip with tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> was thus. About 15 years before this time, Capt. <HI>Wright</HI> being crui&s;ing near that Coa&s;t, and go|ing in among the <HI>Samballoes</HI> I&s;les to &s;trike Fi&s;h and Turtle, took there a young <HI>Indian</HI> Lad as he was pad|dling about in a Canoa. He brought him aboard his Ship, and gave him the name of <HI>John Gret,</HI> cloathing him, and intending to breed him among the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But his <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI> Strikers, taking a fancy to the Boy, begg'd him of Capt. <HI>Wright,</HI> and took him with them at their return into their own Country, where they taught him their Art, and he married a Wife among them, and learnt their Language, as he had done &s;ome broken <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> while he was with Capt <HI>Wright,</HI> which he improved among the <HI>Mo&s;kitoes,</HI> who corre&s;ponding &s;o much with us, do all of them &s;matter <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> after a &s;ort; but his own Language he had almo&s;t forgot. Thus he lived among them for many years; till about 6 or 8 months before our ta+king the&s;e Letters, Capt. <HI>Wright</HI> being again among the <HI>Samballoes,</HI> took thence another <HI>Indian</HI> Boy about 10 or 12 years old, the Son of a Man of &s;ome ac|count among tho&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> and wanting a Striker, he went away to the <HI>Mo&s;kito</HI>'s Country, where he
<PB N="182" REF="204">
took <HI>John Gret,</HI> who was now very expert at it. <HI>John Gret</HI> was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee a Lad there of his own Country, and it came into his mind to per&s;uade Capt. <HI>Wright</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, to endeavour a Friend|&s;hip with tho&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> a thing our Privateers had long coveted, but never dur&s;t attempt, having &s;uch dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of their numbers and fierce|ne&s;s: But <HI>John Gret</HI> offered the Captain that he would go a&s;hoar and negotiate the matter; who ac|cordingly &s;ent him in his Canoa till he was near the &s;hoar, which of a &s;udden was covered with <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;tanding ready with their Bows and Arrows. <HI>John Gret,</HI> who had only a Clout about his middle, as the fa&s;hion of the <HI>Indians</HI> is, leapt then out of the Boat and &s;wam, the Boat retiring a little way back; and the <HI>Indians</HI> a&s;hoar &s;eeing him in that habit, and hearing him call to them in their own Tongue, (which he had recovered by conver&s;ing with the Boy lately taken) &s;uffered him quietly to land, and gathered all about to hear how it was with him. He told them particularly, that he was one of their Countrymen, and how he had been taken many years ago by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had u&s;ed him very kindly; that they were mi&s;taken in being &s;o much afraid of that Nation, who were not Enemies to them, but to the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> to confirm this, he told them how well the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> treated another young Lad of theirs, they had lately taken, &s;uch a ones Son; for this he had learnt of the Youth, and his Father was one of the Company that was got together on the &s;hoar. He per&s;uaded them therefore to make a League with the&s;e friendly People, by who&s;e help they might be able to quell the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> a&s;&s;uring al&s;o the Father of the Boy, that if he would but go with him to the Ship, which they &s;aw at anchor at an I&s;land there (it was <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> the Ea&s;termo&s;t of the <HI>Samballoes,</HI> a place where there is good &s;triking for Turtle) he &s;hould have his Son re&s;tored to him,
<PB N="183" REF="205">
and they might all expect a very kind reception. Upon the&s;e A&s;&s;urances 20 or 30 of them went off pre&s;ently, in 2 or 3 Canoas laden with Plantains, Bo|nanoes, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Capt. <HI>Wright</HI> having treated them on board, went a&s;hoar with them, and was en|tertained by them, and pre&s;ents were made on each &s;ide. Captain <HI>Wright</HI> gave the Boy to his Father in a very hand&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, which he had cau&s;ed to be made purpo&s;ely for him; and an Agreement was immediately &s;truck up between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who invited the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> through their Coun|try into the <HI>South Seas.</HI></P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Agreement, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when they came upon any &s;uch De&s;ign, or for Traffick with them, were to give a certain Signal which they pitcht upon, whereby they might be known. But it hap|pened that Mr. <HI>la Sound,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Captain &s;poken of a little before, being then one of Captain <HI>Wright</HI>'s Men, learnt this Signal, and &s;taying a&s;hoar at <HI>Petit-Guavres,</HI> upon Captain <HI>Wright</HI>'s going thither &s;oon after, who had his Commi&s;&s;ion from thence, he gave the other <HI>French</HI> there &s;uch an account of the Agreement before-mentioned, and the ea&s;ine&s;s of entring the <HI>South Seas</HI> thereupon, that he got at the head of about 120 of them, who made that un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt upon <HI>Cheapo,</HI> as I &s;aid, making u&s;e of the Signal they had learnt for pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Indians</HI> Country, who at that time could not di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o well between the &s;everal Nations of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> as they can &s;ince.</P>
<P>From &s;uch &s;mall beginnings aro&s;e tho&s;e great &s;tirs that have been &s;ince made over the <HI>South Seas, viz.</HI> from the Letters we took, and from the Friend&s;hip contracted with the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> by means of <HI>John Gret.</HI> Yet this Friend&s;hip had like to have been &s;tifled in its Infancy; for within few Months after an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trading Sloop came on this Coa&s;t from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>John Gret,</HI> who by this time had advanced him&s;elf a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="184" REF="206">
a Grandee among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> together with 5 or 6 more of that Quality, went off to the Sloop in their long Gowns, as the cu&s;tom is for &s;uch to wear among them. Being received aboard, they expected to find every thing friendly, and <HI>John Gret</HI> talkt to them in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, having no know|ledge at all of what had happened, endeavoured to make them Slaves (as is commonly done) for upon carrying them to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they could have &s;old them for 10 or 12 Pound a piece. But <HI>John Gret,</HI> and the re&s;t, perceiving this, leapt all over-board, and were by the others killed every one of them in the Water. The <HI>Indians</HI> on &s;hoar never came to the knowledge of it; if they had it would have endangered our Cor|re&s;pondence. Several times after upon our conver|&s;ing with 'em, they enquired of us what was become of their Country-men: but we told them we knew not, as indeed it was a great while after that we heard this Story; &s;o they concluded the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had met with them, and killed, or taken them.</P>
<P>But to return to the account of the progre&s;s of the Armada which we left at <HI>Cartagena:</HI> After an ap|pointed &s;tay there of about 60 days, as I take it, it goes thence to <HI>Portobel,</HI> where it lies 30 days, and no longer. Therefore the Vice-roy of <HI>Lima,</HI> on notice of the Armada's arrival at <HI>Cartagena,</HI> immediately &s;ends away the Kings Trea&s;ure to <HI>Panama,</HI> where it is land|ed, and lies ready to be &s;ent to <HI>Portobel</HI> upon the fir&s;t news of the Armada's arrival there. This is the rea|&s;on partly of their &s;ending Expre&s;&s;es &s;o early to <HI>Lima,</HI> that upon the Armada's fir&s;t coming to <HI>Portobel,</HI> the Trea&s;ure and Goods may lie ready at <HI>Panama,</HI> to be &s;ent away upon the Mules, and it requires &s;ome time for the <HI>Lima</HI> Fleet to unlade, becau&s;e the Ships ride not at <HI>Panama,</HI> but at <HI>Perica,</HI> which are 3 &s;mall I&s;lands 2 leagues from thence. The King's Trea&s;ure is &s;aid to amount commonly to about 24000000 of Pieces of Eight: be&s;ides abundance of Merchants
<PB N="185" REF="207">
Money. All this Trea&s;ure is carried on Mules, and there are large Stables at both places to lodge them. Sometimes the Merchants to &s;teal the Cu&s;tom pack up Money among Goods, and &s;end it to <HI>Venta de Cruzes</HI> on the River <HI>Chagre;</HI> from thence down the River, and afterwards by Sea to <HI>Portobel:</HI> in which pa&s;&s;age I have known a whole Fleet of Periago's and Canoas taken. The Merchants who are not ready to &s;ail by the 30th day after the Armada's arrival, are in danger to be left behind, for the Ships all weigh the 30th day preci&s;ely, and go to the Harbors Mouth: yet &s;ometimes, on great importunity, the Admiral may &s;tay a week longer; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that all the Merchants &s;hould get ready, for want of Men. When the Armada departs from <HI>Portobel,</HI> it re|turns again to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> by which time all the King's Revenue which comes out of the Country is got rea|dy there. Here al&s;o meets them again a great Ship call'd the <HI>Pattache,</HI> one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galeons, which before their fir&s;t arrival at <HI>Cartagena</HI> goes from the re&s;t of the Armada on purpo&s;e to gather the Tribute of the Coa&s;t, touching at the <HI>Magarita</HI>'s, and other places in her way thence to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> as <HI>Punta de Guaira Moracaybo, Riode la Hacha,</HI> and <HI>Sancta Martha;</HI> and at all the&s;e places takes in Trea&s;ure for the King. Af|ter the &s;et &s;tay at <HI>Cartagena,</HI> the <HI>Armada</HI> goes away to the <HI>Havana</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> to meet there the <HI>Flota,</HI> which is a &s;mall number of Ships that go to <HI>la Vera Cruz,</HI> and there takes in the effects of the City and Country of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and what is brought thither in the Ship which comes thither every year from the <HI>Philip|pine</HI> I&s;lands; and having join'd the re&s;t at the <HI>Havana,</HI> the whole <HI>Armada</HI> &s;ets &s;ail for <HI>Spain</HI> through the Gulf of <HI>Florida.</HI> The Ships in the <HI>South Seas</HI> lie a great deal longer at <HI>Panama</HI> before they return to <HI>Lima.</HI> The Merchants and Gentlemen which come from <HI>Lima,</HI> &s;tay as little time as they can at <HI>Portobel,</HI> which is at the be&s;t but a &s;ickly place, and at this time is very full
<PB N="186" REF="208">
of Men from all parts. But <HI>Panama,</HI> as it is not over|charg'd with Men &s;o unrea&s;onably as the other, tho' very full, &s;o it enjoys a good Air, lying open to the Sea-wind; which ri&s;eth commonly about 10 or 11 a Clock in the Morning, and continues till 8 or 9 a Clock at night: then the Land-wind comes, and blows till 8 or 9 in the morning.</P>
<P>There are no Woods nor Mar&s;hes near <HI>Panama,</HI> but a brave dry Champion Land, not &s;ubject to Fogs nor Mi&s;ts. The wet &s;ea&s;on begins in the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> and continues till <HI>November.</HI> At that time the Sea-breezes are at S. S. W. and the Land-winds at N. At the dry Sea&s;on the Winds are mo&s;t betwixt the E. N. E. and the N. Yet off in the Bay they are commonly at South, but of this I &s;hall be more particular in my Chapter of Winds in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> The Rains are not &s;o exce&s;&s;ive about <HI>Panama</HI> it &s;elf, as on either &s;ide of the Bay; yet in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they are &s;evere enough. Gen|tlemen that come from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Panama,</HI> e&s;pecially in the&s;e Months, cut their Hair clo&s;e to pre&s;erve them from Fevers; for the place is &s;ickly to them, becau&s;e they come out of a Country which never hath any Rains or Fogs, but enjoys a con&s;tant Serenity; but I am apt to believe this City is healthy enough to any other People. Thus much for <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>The 20th day we went and anchored within a league of the I&s;lands <HI>Perico</HI> (which are only 3 little barren rocky I&s;lands) in expectation of the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama</HI>'s An&s;wer to the Letter, I &s;aid, we &s;ent him by <HI>Don Diego,</HI> treating about exchange of Pri&s;oners; this being the day on which he had given us his Pa|role to return with an an&s;wer. The 21&s;t day we took another Bark laden with Hogs, Fowl, Salt Beef, and Molo&s;&s;oes: &s;he came from <HI>Lavelia</HI> and was going to <HI>Panama.</HI> In the afternoon we &s;ent another Letter a|&s;hoar by a young <HI>Ma&s;ti&s;o</HI> (a mixtbreed of <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Europeans</HI>) directed to the Pre&s;ident, and 3 or 4 Co|pies
<PB N="187" REF="209">
of it to be di&s;per&s;ed abroad among the common People. This Letter, which was full of Threats, to|gether with the young Man's managing the bu&s;ine&s;s, wrought &s;o powerfully among the common People, that the City was in an uproar. The Pre&s;ident im|mediately &s;ent a Gentleman aboard, who demanded the Flower-Prize that we took off of <HI>Gallo,</HI> and all the Pri&s;oners, for the Ran&s;om of our two Men: but our Captains told him they would exchange Man for Man. The Gentleman &s;aid he had not Orders for that, but if he would &s;tay till the next day he would bring the Governours An&s;wer. The next day he brought aboard our two Men, and had about 40 Pri&s;oners in exchange.</P>
<P>The 24th day, we run over to the I&s;land <HI>Tabago. Tabago</HI> is in the Bay, and about 6 Leagues South of <HI>Panama.</HI> It is about 3 mile long, and 2 broad, a high mountainous I&s;land. On the North-&s;ide it declines with a gentle de&s;cent to the Sea. The Land by the Sea is of a black Mold and deep; but towards the top of the Mountain it is &s;trong and dry. The North|&s;ide of this I&s;land makes a very plea&s;ant &s;hew; it &s;eems to be a Garden of Fruit inclo&s;ed with many high Trees; the chiefe&s;t Fruits are Plantains and Bona|na's. They thrive very well from the foot to the middle of it; but tho&s;e near the top are but &s;mall, as wanting moi&s;ture. Clo&s;e by the Sea there are many Coco-Nut-Trees, which make a very plea&s;ant &s;ight. Within the Coco-Nut-Trees there grow many <HI>Mam|met</HI> Trees. The <HI>Mammet</HI> is a large, tall, and &s;trait-bodied Tree, clean, without Knots or Limbs, for 6 or 70 foot, or more. The Head &s;preads abroad into many &s;mall Limbs, which grow pretty thick, and clo&s;e together. The Bark is of a dark grey colom, thick and rough, full of large Chops. The Fruit is bigger than Quince; it is round, and cover'd with a thick Rind, of a grey colour: When the Fruit is ripe the Rind is yellow and though; and it will then peel
<PB N="188" REF="210">
off like Leather; but before it is ripe it is brittle: the juice is then white and clammy; but when ripe, not &s;o. The ripe Fruit under the Rind is yellow as a Carrot, and in the middle are two large rough &s;tones, flat, and each of them much bigger than an Almond. The Fruit &s;mells very well, and the ta&s;te is an&s;wera|ble to the &s;mell. The S. W. end of the I&s;land hath never been cleared, but is full of Fire-wood, and Trees of divers &s;orts. There is a very fine &s;mall Brook of fre&s;h Water, that &s;prings out of the &s;ide of the Mountain, and gliding thro' the Grove of Fruit-trees, falls into the Sea on the North-&s;ide. There was a &s;mall Town &s;tanding by the Sea, with a Church at one end, but now the bigge&s;t part of it is de&s;troyed by the Privateers. There is good anchoring right a|gain&s;t the Town, about a mile from the &s;hoar, where you may have 16 or 18 fathom Water, &s;oft oazy ground. There is a &s;mall I&s;land clo&s;e by the N. W. end of this called <HI>Tabogilla,</HI> with a &s;mall Channel to pa&s;s between. There is another woody I&s;land a|bout a mile on the N. E. &s;ide of <HI>Tabago,</HI> and a good Channel between them: this I&s;land hath no Name that ever I heard.</P>
<P>While we lay at <HI>Tabago,</HI> we had like to have had a &s;curvy trick plaid us by a pretended Merchant from <HI>Panama,</HI> who came, as by &s;tealth, to traffick with us privately; a thing common enough with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants, both in the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Seas,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding the &s;evere Prohibitions of the Governours; who yet &s;ometimes connive at it, and will even trade with the Privateers them&s;elves. Our Merchant was by agreement to bring out his Bark laden with Goods in the night, and we to go and anchor at the South of <HI>Perico.</HI> Out he came, with a Fire&s;hip in&s;tead of a Bark, and approached very near, haling us with the Watch-word we had agreed upon. We &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, call'd to them to come to an anchor, and upon their not doing &s;o fir'd at them: when immediately
<PB N="189" REF="211">
their Men going out into the Canoas, &s;et fire to their Ship, which blew up, and burnt clo&s;e by us; &s;o that we were forc'd to cut our Cables in all ha&s;te, and &s;camper away as well as we could.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not altogether &s;o politick in ap|pointing to meet us at <HI>Perico,</HI> for there we had Sea|room; whereas had he come thus upon us at <HI>Tabago,</HI> the Land-wind bearing hard upon us as it did, we mu&s;t either have been burnt by the Fire&s;hip, or upon loo&s;ing our Cables have been driven a&s;hore: But I &s;uppo&s;e they cho&s;e <HI>Perico</HI> rather for the Scene of their Enterprize, partly becau&s;e they might there be&s;t &s;culk among the I&s;lands, and partly becau&s;e, if their Exploit fail'd, they could thence e&s;cape be&s;t from our Canoas to <HI>Panama,</HI> but 2 leagues off.</P>
<P>During this Exploit, Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> (who&s;e Ship was le&s;s than ours, and &s;o not &s;o much aim'd at by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) lay about a mile off, with a Canoa at the Buoy of his Anchor, as fearing &s;ome Treachery from our pretended Merchant; and a little before the Bark blew up, he &s;aw a &s;mall Float on the Water, and, as it appear'd, a Man on it, making towards his Ship; but the Man dived, and di&s;appear'd of a &s;udden, as thinking probably that he was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>This was &s;uppo&s;ed to be one coming with &s;ome combu&s;tible Matter to have &s;tuck about the Rudder. For &s;uch a Trick Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> was &s;erved at <HI>Co|quimbo,</HI> and his Ship had like to have been burnt by it, if, by meer accident, it had not been di&s;cover'd: I was then aboard Captain <HI>Sharp</HI>'s Ship. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;eeing the Blaze by us, cut his Cables as we did, his Bark did the like; &s;o we kept under Sail all the Night, being more &s;car'd than hurt. The Bark that was on Fire drove burning towards <HI>Taba|go;</HI> but after the fir&s;t bla&s;t &s;he did not burn clear, only made a &s;mother, for &s;he was not well made, though Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> had the framing and manage|ment of it.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="212">
This Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> was he of whom I made mention in my 4th Chapter. He, after his being at the I&s;les of Cape <HI>Verd,</HI> &s;tood away for the <HI>South Seas,</HI> at the in&s;tigation of one <HI>Richard Morton,</HI> who had been with Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI> in the <HI>South Seas.</HI> In his way he met with Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> and they two con&s;orted a day or two: At la&s;t <HI>Morton</HI> went aboard Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> and per&s;waded him to lo&s;e Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> in the Night, which Capt. <HI>Eaton</HI> did, <HI>Morton</HI> continuing aboard of Capt. <HI>Eaton,</HI> as finding his the better Ship. Capt. <HI>Bond</HI> thus lo&s;ing both his Con&s;ort <HI>Eaton,</HI> and <HI>Mor|ton</HI> his Pilot, and his Ship being but an ordinary Sailer, he de&s;paired of getting into the <HI>South Seas;</HI> and had plaid &s;uch tricks among the <HI>Caribbee I&s;les,</HI> as I have been told, that he did not dare to appear at any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;lands. Therefore he per&s;wa|ded his Men to go to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and they con|&s;ented to do any thing that he &s;hould propo&s;e: So he pre&s;ently &s;teered away into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the fir&s;t place where he came to an Anchor was at <HI>Portabel.</HI> He pre&s;ently declared to the Governour, that there were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships coming into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and that if they que&s;tion'd it, he offered to be kept a Pri&s;oner, till time &s;hould di&s;cover the truth of what he &s;aid; but they believed him, and &s;ent him away to <HI>Panama,</HI> where he was in great e&s;teem. This &s;everal Pri&s;oners told us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Panama</HI> could not have fitted out their Fire-&s;hip without this Capt. <HI>Bond</HI>'s a&s;&s;i|&s;tance; for it is &s;trange to &s;ay how gro&s;ly ignorant the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but e&s;pecially in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> are of Sea-affairs. They build in|deed good Ships, but this is a &s;mall matter: for any Ship of a good bottom will &s;erve for the&s;e Seas on the South Coa&s;t. They rig their Ships but untowardly, have no Guns, but in 3 or 4 of the King's Ships, and are meanly furni&s;hed with Warlike Provi&s;ions, and much at a lo&s;s for the making any Fire&s;hips or other
<PB N="191" REF="213">
le&s;s u&s;ual Machines. Nay, they have not the &s;en&s;e to have their Guns run within the &s;ides upon their di&s;|charge, but have Platforms without for the Men to &s;tand on to charge them; &s;o that when we come near we can fetch them down with &s;mall &s;hot out of our Boats. A main rea&s;on of this is, that the Native <HI>Spa|niards</HI> are too proud to be Seamen, but u&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> for all tho&s;e Offices: One <HI>Spaniard,</HI> it may be, going in the Ship to command it, and him&s;elf of little more knowledge than tho&s;e poor ignorant Creatures: nor can they gain much Experience, &s;eldom going far off to Sea, but coa&s;ting along the Shores.</P>
<P>But to proceed: In the Morning when it was light we came again to an anchor clo&s;e by our Buoys, and &s;trove to get our Anchors again; but our Buoy-Ropes being rotten, broke. While we were puzling about our Anchors, we &s;aw a great many Canoas full of Men pa&s;s between <HI>Tabago</HI> and the other I&s;land. This put us into a new Con&s;ternation: We lay &s;till &s;ome time, till we &s;aw that they came directly towards us, then we weighed and &s;tood towards them: And when we came within hale, we found that they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Privateers come out of the <HI>North Seas</HI> through the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI> They were 280 Men in 28 Canoas; 200 of them <HI>French;</HI> the re&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They were commanded by Capt. <HI>Gronet,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Lequie.</HI> We pre&s;ently came to an Anchor again, and all the Canoas came aboard. The&s;e Men told us, that there were 180 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men more, un|der the command of Capt. <HI>Towneley,</HI> in the Coun|try of <HI>Darien,</HI> making <HI>Canoas</HI> (as the&s;e men had been) to bring them into the&s;e Seas. All the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men that came over in this Party were immediately en|tertain'd by Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt <HI>Swan</HI> in their own Ships; and the <HI>French</HI> men were order'd to have our Flower-Prize to carry them, and Capt. <HI>Gronet,</HI> being the elde&s;t Commander, was to command them there; and thus they were all di&s;po&s;ed of to their
<PB N="192" REF="214">
Hearts content. Capt. <HI>Gronet,</HI> to retalliate this kind|ne&s;s, offer'd Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan,</HI> each of them a new Commi&s;&s;ion from the Governour of <HI>Pe|tit Guavres.</HI> It hath been u&s;ual for many years pa&s;t, for the Governor of <HI>P. Cuavres</HI> to &s;end blank Com|mi&s;&s;ions to Sea by many of his Captains, with orders to di&s;po&s;e of them to whom they &s;aw convenient. Tho&s;e of <HI>Petit Guavres</HI> by this means making them|&s;elves the Sanctuary and A&s;ylum of all People of de|&s;perate Fortunes, and increa&s;ing their own Wealth, and the Strength and Reputation of their Party thereby. Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> accepted of one, having be|fore only an old Commi&s;&s;ion, which fell to him by Inheritance at the decea&s;e of Capt. <HI>Cook;</HI> who took it from Capt. <HI>Tri&s;tian,</HI> together with his Bark, as is before mentioned. But Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, He had an Order from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> neither to give offence to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor to re|ceive any affront from them; and that he had been injured by them at <HI>Baldivia,</HI> where they had kill'd &s;ome of his Men, and wounded &s;everal more; &s;o that he thought he had a lawful Commi&s;&s;ion of his own to right him&s;elf. I never read any of the&s;e <HI>French</HI> Commi&s;&s;ions while I was in the&s;e Seas, nor did I then know the import of them; but I have learnt &s;ince, that the Tenour of them is, to give a Liberty to Fi&s;h, Fowl, and Hunt. The occa&s;ion of this is, that the I&s;land <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where the Garri&s;on of <HI>Petit-Guavres</HI> is, belongs partly to the <HI>French,</HI> and partly to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and in time of Peace the&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ions are given as a Warrant to tho&s;e of each &s;ide to protect them from the adver&s;e Party: But in ef|fect the <HI>French</HI> do not re&s;train them to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> but make them a pretence for a general ravage in any part of <HI>America</HI> by Sea or Land.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;po&s;ed of our A&s;&s;ociates, we in|tended to &s;ail towards the Gulf of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> to &s;eek Capt. <HI>Townley;</HI> who by this time we thought
<PB N="193" REF="215">
might be entering into the&s;e Seas. Accordingly the &s;econd day of <HI>March,</HI> 1685, we &s;ailed from hence towards the Gulph of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> This Gulf lies near 30 leagues from <HI>Panama,</HI> towards the S. E. The way thither from <HI>Panama</HI> is, to pa&s;s between the <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> and the Main. It is a place where many great Rivers having fini&s;hed their cour&s;es are &s;wallowed up in the Sea. It is bounded on the S. with Point <HI>Garachina,</HI> which lieth in North lat. 6 d. 40 m. and on the North &s;ide with Cape St. <HI>Lorenzo.</HI> Where by the way I mu&s;t correct a gro&s;s error in our common Maps; which giving no name at all to the South Cape, which yet is the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble, and is the true Point <HI>Garachina;</HI> do give that name to the North Cape, which is of &s;mall remark, only for tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is into the Gulf: and the name <HI>St. Lorenzo,</HI> which is the true name of this Northern Point, is by them wholly omitted; the name of the other Point being &s;ub&s;tituted into its place. The chief Rivers which run into this Gulf of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> are <HI>Santa Maria, Sambo,</HI> and <HI>Congos.</HI> The River <HI>Congos</HI> (which is the River I would have per&s;uaded our Men to have gone up, as their neare&s;t way in our Journey over Land, mentioned Chap. 1.) comes directly out of the Country, and &s;wallows up many &s;mall Streams that fall into it from both &s;ides; and at la&s;t loo&s;eth it &s;elf on the North &s;ide of the Gulf, a league within Cape <HI>St. Lorenzo.</HI> It is not very wide, but deep, and navigable &s;ome leagues within Land. There are Sands without it; but a Channel for Ships. 'Tis not made u&s;e of by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> becau&s;e of the neighbourhood of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> River; where they have mo&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s on ac|count of the Mines.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Sambo</HI> &s;eems to be a great River, for there is a grear tide at its mouth; but I can &s;ay nothing more of it, having never been in it. This River falls into the Sea on the South-&s;ide of the Gulf,
<PB N="194" REF="216">
near Point <HI>Garachina.</HI> Between the Mouths of the&s;e 2 Rivers on either &s;ide, the Gulf runs in towards the Land &s;omewhat narrower, and makes 5 or 6 &s;mall I&s;lands, which are cloathed with great Trees, green and flouri&s;hing all the year and good Channels be|tween the I&s;lands. Beyond which, further in &s;till, the &s;hoar on each &s;ide clo&s;es &s;o near, with 2 Points of low Mangrove Land, as to make a narrow or &s;traight, &s;carce half a mile wide. This &s;erves as a mouth or enterance to the Inner-part of the Gulf, which is a deep Bay 2 or 3 leagues over every way, and about the Ea&s;t-end thereof are the mouths of &s;everal Rivers, the chief of which is that of <HI>Santa Maria.</HI> There are many Outlets or Creeks be&s;ides this narrow place I have de&s;cribed, but none navi|gable be&s;ide that. For this rea&s;on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guard-Ship, mention'd in Chap 1. cho&s;e to lie between the&s;e two Points, as the only Pa&s;&s;age they could imagine we &s;hould attempt; &s;ince this is the way that the Privateers have generally taken, as the neare&s;t, between the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Seas.</HI> The River of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> is the large&s;t of all the Rivers of this Gulf: It is navigable 8 or 9 leagues up, for &s;o high the tide flows. Beyond that place the Ri|ver is divided into many Branches, which are only fit for Canoas. The tide ri&s;es and falls in this Ri|ver about 18 foot.</P>
<P>About 6 leagues from the Rivers mouth, on the South-&s;ide of it, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> about 20 years ago, upon their fir&s;t di&s;covery of the Gold Mines here, built the Town <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> of the &s;ame name with the River. This Town was taken by Captain <HI>Coxen</HI> Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> and Captain <HI>Sharp,</HI> at their entrance into the&s;e Seas; it being then but newly built. Since that time it is grown con&s;iderable; for when Cap|tain <HI>Harris,</HI> the Nephew of the former, took it (as is &s;aid in Chap. 6.) he found in it all &s;orts of Trade&s;|men, with a great deal of Flower, and Wine, and
<PB N="195" REF="217">
abundance of Iron Crows and Pickaxes. The&s;e were In&s;truments for the Slaves to work in the Gold Mines; for be&s;ides what Gold and Sand they take up together, they often find greatlumps, wedg'd be|tween the Rocks, as if it naturally grew there. I have &s;een a lump as big as a Hens Egg, brought by Cap|tain <HI>Harris</HI> from thence, (who took 120 pound there) and he told me that there were lumps a great deal bigger: but the&s;e they were forc'd to beat in pieces that they might divide them. The&s;e lumps are not &s;o &s;olid, but that they have crevi&s;es and pores full of Earth and Du&s;t. This Town is not far from the Mines, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep a great many Slaves to work in the dry time of the year; but in the rainy Sea&s;on, when the Rivers do overflow, they cannot work &s;o well. Yet the Mines are &s;o nigh the Mountains, that as the Rivers &s;oon ri&s;e, &s;o they are &s;oon down again; and pre&s;ently after the rain is the be&s;t &s;earching for Gold in the Sands; for the violent rains do wa&s;h down the Gold into the Ri|vers, where much of it &s;ettles to the bottom and re|mains. Then the Native <HI>Indians</HI> who live here|abouts get mo&s;t; and of them the <HI>Spaniards</HI> buy more Gold than their Slaves get by working. I have been told that they get the value of 5 Shillings a day, one with another. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> withdraw mo&s;t of them with their Slaves during the wet Sea&s;on, to <HI>Panama.</HI> At this Town of <HI>St. Maria,</HI> Captain <HI>Townley</HI> was lying with his Party, making Canoas, when Captain <HI>Gronet</HI> came into the Seas; for it was then abandoned by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>There is another &s;mall new Town at the mouth of the River, called the <HI>Scuchaderoes:</HI> It &s;tands on the North &s;ide of the open place, at the mouth of the River of <HI>St. Maria,</HI> where there is more air than at the Mines, or at <HI>Santa Maria</HI> Town, where they are in a manner &s;tifled with heat for want of air.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="218">
All about the&s;e Rivers, e&s;pecially near the Sea, the Land is low, it is deep black Earth, and the Trees it produceth are extraordinary large and high. Thus much concerning the Gulf of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> whi|ther we were bound.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of <HI>March,</HI> as is &s;aid before, we weighed from <HI>Perico,</HI> and the &s;ame night we anchor'd again at <HI>Pacheque.</HI> The third day we &s;ailed from thence, &s;teering towards the Gulf. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> undertook to fetch off Capt. <HI>Townley</HI> and his Men: therefore he kept near the Main; but the re&s;t of the Ships &s;tood nearer the <HI>Kings I&s;lands.</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> de&s;ired this Office, becau&s;e he intended to &s;end Let|ters over-land by the <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which he did; ordering the <HI>Indians</HI> to deliver his Letters to any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in the other Seas. At 2 a clock we were again near the place where we clean'd our Ships. There we &s;aw 2 Ships coming out, who proved to be Captain <HI>Townley</HI> and his Men. They were coming out of the River in the night, and took 2 Barks bound for <HI>Panama:</HI> the one was laden with Flower, the other with Wine, Brandy, Sugar, and Oyl. The Pri&s;oners that he took declared, that the <HI>Lima</HI> Fleet was ready to &s;ail. We went and anchored among the <HI>Kings I&s;lands,</HI> and the next day Captain <HI>Swan</HI> returned out of the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> being informed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that Captain <HI>Townley</HI> was come over to the <HI>Kings I&s;lands.</HI> At this place Captain <HI>Townley</HI> put out a great deal of his Goods to make room for his Men. He di&s;tributed his Wine and Brandy, &s;ome to every Ship, that it might be drunk out, becau&s;e he wanted the Jars to carry Water in. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the&s;e Seas carry all their Wine, Brandy and Oyl, in Jars that hold 7 or 8 Gallons. When they lade at <HI>Pi&s;co</HI> (a place about 40 leagues to the Southward of <HI>Lima,</HI> and fa|mous for Wine) they bring nothing el&s;e but Jars of Wine, and they &s;tow one tier on the top of another
<PB N="197" REF="219">
&s;o artificially, that we could hardly do the like without breaking them: yet they often carry in this manner 1500 or 2000, or more, in a Ship, and &s;el|dom break one. The 10th day we took a &s;mall Bark that came from <HI>Guiaquil:</HI> &s;he had nothing in her but Balla&s;t. The 12th day there came an <HI>In|dian</HI> Canoa out of the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> and told us, that there were 300 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> men more coming over-land from the <HI>North-Seas.</HI> The 15th day we met a Bark, with 5 or 6 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men in her, that belonged to Captain <HI>Knight,</HI> who had been in the <HI>South Seas</HI> 5 or 6 Months, and was now on the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t. There he had &s;pied this Bark; but not being able to come up with her in his Ship, he detach'd the&s;e 5 or 6 Men in a Canoa, who took her, but when they had done could not recover their own Ship again, lo&s;ing company with her in the night; and therefore they came into the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> intending to go over-land back into the <HI>North Seas,</HI> but that they luckily met with us: for the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien</HI> was now become a common Road for Privateers to pa&s;s between the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Seas</HI> at their plea&s;ure. This Bark of Captain <HI>Knight</HI>'s had in her 40 or 50 Jars of Brandy: &s;he was now commanded by Mr. <HI>Henry More;</HI> but Captain <HI>Swan</HI> intending to promote Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>More</HI> to be turned out, alledging, that it was ve|ry likely the&s;e Men were run away from their Commander. Mr. <HI>More</HI> willingly re&s;igned her, and went aboard of Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and became one of his Men.</P>
<P>It was now the latter end of the dry Sea&s;on here; and the Water at the <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Pearl I&s;lands,</HI> of which there was plenty when we fir&s;t came hither, was now dried away. Therefore we were forced to go to Point <HI>Garachina,</HI> thinking to Water our Ships there. Captain <HI>Harris</HI> being now Com|mander of the new Bark, was &s;ent into the River
<PB N="198" REF="220">
of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> to &s;ee for tho&s;e Men that the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> told us of, whil&s;t the re&s;t of the Ships &s;ailed to|wards Point <HI>Garachina;</HI> where we arrived the 21&s;t day, and anchored 2 mile from the Point, and found a &s;trong Tide running out of the River <HI>Sambo.</HI> The next day we run within the Point, and anchored in 4 fathom at low Water. The Tide ri&s;eth here 8 or 9 foot: the Flood &s;ets N. N. E. the Ebb S. S. W. The <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabit in the River <HI>Sambo</HI> came to us in Canoas, and brought Plantains and Bonanoes. They could not &s;peak nor under|&s;tand <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> therefore I believe they have no Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We found no fre&s;h Water here neither; &s;o we went from hence to <HI>Porto-Pinas,</HI> which is 7 leagues S. by W. from hence.</P>
<P><HI>Porto-Pinas</HI> lieth in lat. 7 d. North. It is &s;o called, becau&s;e there are many Pine-trees growing there. The Land is pretty high, ri&s;ing gently as it runs in|to the Country. This Country near the Sea is all covered with pretty high Woods: the Land that bounds the Harbor is low in the middle, but high and rocky on both &s;ides. At the mouth of the Har|bor there are 2 &s;mall high I&s;lands, or rather barren Rocks. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Pilot Books com|mend this for a good Harbor; but it lieth all open to the S. W. Winds, which frequently blow here in the wet Sea&s;on: be&s;ide, the Harbor within the I&s;lands is a place of but &s;mall extent, and hath a very narrow going in; what depth of Water there is in the Harbor I know not.</P>
<P>The 25th day we arrived at this Harbor of Pines, but did not go in with our Ship, find|ing it but an ordinary place to lie at. We &s;ent in our Boats to &s;earch it, and they found a &s;tream of good Water running into the Sea; but there were &s;uch great &s;welling Surges came into the Harbor, that we could not conveniently fill our Water there.
<PB N="199" REF="221">
The 26th day we returned to Point <HI>Garachina</HI> again. In our way we took a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el laden with Cacao: &s;he came from <HI>Guiaquil.</HI> The 29th day we arrived at Point <HI>Garachina:</HI> There we found Cap|tain <HI>Harris,</HI> who had been in the River of <HI>Santa Maria;</HI> but he did not meet the Men that he went for. Yet we was informed again by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they were making Canoas in one of the branches of the River of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> Here we &s;hared our Cacao lately taken.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we could not fill our water here, we de|&s;igned to go to <HI>Tabago</HI> again, where we were &s;ure to be &s;upplied. Accordingly, on the 30th day we &s;et &s;ail, being now 9 Ships in company; and had a &s;mall wind at S. S. E. The fir&s;t day of <HI>April,</HI> be|ing in the Channel between the <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> and the Main, we had much Thunder, Lightning, and &s;ome Rain: This Evening we anchored at the I&s;land <HI>Pacheque,</HI> and immediately &s;ent 4 Canoas before us to the I&s;land <HI>Tabago</HI> to take &s;ome Pri&s;o|ners for information, and we followed the next day. The 3d day in the evening we anchored by <HI>Pe|rica,</HI> and the next morning went to <HI>Tabago:</HI> where we found our 4 Canoas. They arrived there in the night, and took a Canoa that came (as is u&s;ual) from <HI>Panama</HI> for Plantains. There were in the Ca|noa 4 <HI>Indians</HI> and a <HI>Mulata.</HI> The <HI>Mulata,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;aid he was in the Fire&s;hip that came to burn us in the night, was immediately hanged. The&s;e Pri|&s;oners confirmed, that one Capt. <HI>Bond,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, did command her.</P>
<P>Here we filled our Water, and cut Firewood; and from hence we &s;ent 4 Canoas over to the Main, with one of the <HI>Indians</HI> lately taken to guide them to a Sugar-work: for, now we had Cacao, we wanted Sugar to make Chocolate. But the chief|e&s;t of their bu&s;ine&s;s was to get Coppers, for each Ship having now &s;o many Men, our Pots would
<PB N="200" REF="222">
not boil Victuals fa&s;t enough, though we kept them boiling all the day. About 2 or 3 days after they returned aboard with 3 Coppers.</P>
<P>While we lay here Captain <HI>Davis</HI> his Bark went to the I&s;land <HI>Otoque.</HI> This is another inhabited I&s;land in the Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> not &s;o big as <HI>Tabago,</HI> yet there are good Plantain-walks on it, and &s;ome Negroes to look after them. The&s;e Negroes rear Fowls and Hogs for their Ma&s;ters, who live at <HI>Pana|ma,</HI> as at the <HI>Kings I&s;lands.</HI> It was for &s;ome Fowls or Hogs that our Men went thither; but by acci|dent they met al&s;o with an Expre&s;s, that was &s;ent to <HI>Panama</HI> with an account, that the <HI>Lima</HI> Fleet was at Sea. Mo&s;t of the Letters were thrown over|board and lo&s;t; yet we found &s;ome that &s;aid po&s;i|tively, that the Fleet was coming with all the &s;trength that they could make in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru;</HI> yet were ordered not to fight us, except they were forc'd to it: (though afterwards they cho&s;e to fight us, having fir&s;t landed their Trea&s;ure at <HI>Lavelia</HI>) and that the Pilots of <HI>Lima</HI> had been in con&s;ultation what cour&s;e to &s;teer to mi&s;s us.</P>
<P>For the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who may be curious to know, I have here in&s;erted the Re&s;olutions taken by the Committee of Pilots, as one of our compa|ny tran&s;lated them out of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> of two of the Letters we took. The fir&s;t Letter as follows.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving been with his Excellency, and heard the Letter of Captain. <HI>Michael Sanches de Tena</HI> read; wherein he &s;ays, there &s;hould be a meeting of the Pilots of <HI>Panama</HI> in the &s;aid City, they &s;ay 'tis not time, putting for objection the <HI>Gallapagoes;</HI> to which I an&s;wered, That it was fear of the Enemy, and that they might well go that way. I told this to his Excellency, who was plea&s;ed to command me to write the Cour&s;e, which is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="223">
The day for &s;ailing being come, go forth to the We&s;t South We&s;t; from that to the We&s;t till you are forty leagues off at Sea, then keep at the &s;ame di&s;tance to the N. W. till you come under the Line: from whence the Pilot mu&s;t &s;hape his Cour&s;e for <HI>Moro de Porco,</HI> and for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Lavelia</HI> and <HI>Natta:</HI> where you may &s;peak with the People, and according to the In|formation they give, you may keep the &s;ame Cour&s;e for <HI>Otoque,</HI> from thence to <HI>Tabago,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Panama;</HI> This is what offers as to the Cour&s;e.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The Letter is ob&s;cure: But the Reader mu&s;t make what he can of it. The Directions in the other Letter were to this effect.<LETTER>
<P>THE &s;ure&s;t Cour&s;e to be ob&s;erved going forth from <HI>Malabrigo,</HI> is thus: You mu&s;t &s;ail W. by S. that you may avoid the &s;ight of the I&s;lands of <HI>Lobos;</HI> and if you &s;hould chance to &s;ee them, by rea&s;on of the Breezes, and &s;hould fall to Leward of the Lat. of <HI>Malabrigo,</HI> keep on a Wind as near as you can, and if nece&s;&s;ary, go about and &s;tand in for the &s;hoar: then tack and &s;tand off, and be &s;ure keep your Latitude; and when you are 40 leagues to the We&s;tward of the I&s;land <HI>Lobos,</HI> keep that di&s;tance till you come under the Line; and then, if the general Wind follows you farther, you mu&s;t &s;ail N.

And if in this Lat. you &s;hould find the breezes, make it your bu&s;ine&s;s to keep the Coa&s;t, and &s;o &s;ail for <HI>Panama.</HI> If in your cour&s;e you &s;hould come in &s;ight of the Land before you are abre&s;t of Cape <HI>St. Franci&s;co,</HI> be &s;ure to &s;tretch off again out of &s;ight of Land that you may not be di&s;covered by the Enemy.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The la&s;t Letter &s;uppo&s;es the Fleet's &s;etting out from <HI>Malabrigo,</HI> in about 8 deg. South Lat. (as the other doth its going immediately from <HI>Lima,</HI> 4 deg. further South) and from hence is that Caution given of avoiding <HI>Lobos,</HI> as near <HI>Malabrigo,</HI> in their
<PB N="202" REF="224">
u&s;ual way to <HI>Panama,</HI> ahd hardly to be kept out of &s;ight, as the Winds are thereabouts: yet to be avoid|ed by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet at this time, becau&s;e as they had twice before heard of the Privateers lying at <HI>Lobos de la Mar,</HI> they knew not but at that time we might be there in expectation of them.</P>
<P>The 10th day we &s;ailed from <HI>Tabago</HI> towards the <HI>Kings I&s;land</HI> again, becau&s;e our Pilots told us, that the King's Ships did always come this way. The 11th day we anchored at the place where we ca|reen'd. Here we found Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> who had gone a &s;econd time into the River of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> and fetched the body of Men that la&s;t came over Land, as the <HI>Indians</HI> had informed us: but they fell &s;hort of the number they told us of. The 29th day we &s;ent 250 Men in 15 Canoas to the River <HI>Cheapo,</HI> to take the Town of <HI>Cheapo.</HI> The 21&s;t day all our Ships, but Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> who &s;taid to clean his Ships, followed after. The 22d day we arriv'd at the I&s;land <HI>Chepelio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chepelio</HI> is the plea&s;ante&s;t I&s;land in the Bay of <HI>Pa|nama:</HI> It is but 7 Leagues from the City of <HI>Panama,</HI> and a League from the Main. This I&s;land is about 2 mile long, and almo&s;t &s;o broad; it is low on the North-&s;ide, and ri&s;eth by a &s;mall a&s;cent towards the South-&s;ide. The Soil is yellow, a kind of Clay. The high &s;ide is &s;tony; the low Land is planted with all &s;orts of delicate Fruits, <HI>viz.</HI> Sapadilloes, Avogato-pears, Mammees, Mammee-Sappota's, Star-apples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The middle of the I&s;land is plan|ted with Plantain-Trees, which are not very large, but the Fruit extraordinary &s;weet.</P>
<P>The Sapadillo-tree is as big as a large Pear-tree, the Fruit much like to a Bergoma-pear, both in co|lour, &s;hape and &s;ize; but on &s;ome Trees the Fruit is a little longer. When it is green or fir&s;t gathered, the Juice is white and clammy, and it will &s;tick like glew; then the Fruit is hard; but after it hath been
<PB N="203" REF="225">
gathered 2 or 3 days, it grows &s;oft and juicy, and then the Juice is clear as Spring-Water, and very &s;weet; in the mid&s;t of the Fruit are 2 or 3 black Stones or Seeds, about the bigne&s;s of a Pumkin|&s;eed: This is an excellent Fruit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Avogato</HI> Pear-tree is as big as mo&s;t Pear-trees, and is commonly pretty high; the Skin or Bark black, and pretty &s;mooth; the Leaves large, of an oval &s;hape, and the Fruit as big as a large Limon. It is of a green colour till it is ripe, and then it is a little yellowi&s;h. They are &s;eldom fit to eat till they have been gathered 2 or 3 days; then they become &s;oft, and the Skin or Rind will peel off. The &s;ub&s;tance in the in&s;ide is green, or a little yel|lowi&s;h, and as &s;oft as Butter. Within the &s;ub&s;tance there is a Stone as big as a Hor&s;e-Plumb. This Fruit hath no ta&s;te of it &s;elf, and therefore 'tis u&s;u|ally mixt with Sugar and Lime-juice, and beaten together in a Plate; and this is an excellent Di&s;h. The ordinary way is to eat it with a little Salt and a roa&s;ted Plantain; and thus a Man that's hungry, may make a good Meal of it. It is very whol|&s;ome eaten any way. It is reported that this Fruit provokes to Lu&s;t, and therefore is &s;aid to be much e&s;teemed by the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> and I do believe they are much e&s;teemed by them, for I have met with plenty of them in many places in the North-Seas, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;ettled, as in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagena;</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos;</HI> and there are &s;ome in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which were planted by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that I&s;land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mammee-Sappota-Tree</HI> is different from the Mammee de&s;cribed at the I&s;land <HI>Tabago</HI> in this Chapter. It is not &s;o big or &s;o tall, neither is the Fruit &s;o big or &s;o round. The Rind of the Fruit is thin and brittle; the in&s;ide is a deep red, and it has a rough flat long Stone. This is accounted the prin|cipal
<PB N="204" REF="226">
Fruit of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> It is very plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome. I have not &s;een any of the&s;e on <HI>Jamai|ca;</HI> but in many places in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> among the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> There is another &s;ort of Mammee-tree, which is called the wild Mammee: This bears a Fruit which is of no value, but the Tree is &s;traight, tall, and very tough, and therefore principally u&s;ed for making Ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Star-Apple-tree grows much like the Quince-Tree, but much bigger. It is full of Leaves, and the Leaf is broad, of an oval &s;hape, and of a very dark green colour. The Fruit is as big as a large Apple, which is commonly &s;o cover'd with Leaves, that a Man can hardly &s;ee it. They &s;ay this is a good Fruit; I did never ta&s;te any, but have &s;een both of the Trees and Fruit in many place on the Main, on the North-&s;ide of the Continent, and in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> When the <HI>Spaniards</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd that I&s;land, they planted this and other &s;orts of Fruit, as the Sapadillo, Avogato-Pear, and the like; and of the&s;e Fruits there is &s;till in <HI>Jamaica</HI> in tho&s;e Plan|tations that were fir&s;t &s;ettled by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as at the <HI>Angels,</HI> at 7 <HI>Mile Walk,</HI> and 16 <HI>Mile Walk.</HI> There I have &s;een the&s;e Trees which were planted by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but I did never &s;ee any Improvement made by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who &s;eem in that little cu|rious. The Road for Ships is on the North-&s;ide, where there is good anchoring half a mile from the &s;hoar. There is a Well clo&s;e by the Sea on the North &s;ide, and formerly there were 3 or 4 Hou&s;es clo&s;e by it, but now they are de&s;troyed. This I&s;land &s;tands right again&s;t the mouth of the River <HI>Cheapo.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Cheapo</HI> &s;prings out of the Mountains near the North &s;ide of the Country, and it being penn'd up on the South &s;ide by other Mountains, bends its cour&s;e to the We&s;tward between both, till finding a pa&s;&s;age on the S. W. it makes a kind of a half circle; and being &s;well'd to a con&s;idera|ble
<PB N="205" REF="227">
bigne&s;s, it runs with a &s;low motion into the Sea, 7 leagues from <HI>Panama.</HI> This River is very deep and about a quarter of a mile broad; but the mouth of it is choak'd up with Sands, &s;o that no Ships can enter, but Barks may. There is a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town of the &s;ame name within 6 Leagues of the Sea: it &s;tands on the left hand going from the Sea. This is it which I &s;aid Captain <HI>La Sound</HI> attempted. The Land about it is champion, with many &s;mall Hills cloathed with Woods; but the bigge&s;t part of the Country is Savannah. On the South-&s;ide of the River it is all Woodland for many leagues together. It was to this Town that our 250 Men were &s;ent. The 24th day they returned out of the River, ha|ving taken the Town without any oppo&s;ition: but they found nothing in it. By the way going thi|ther they took a Canoa, but mo&s;t of the Men e&s;caped a&s;hoar upon one of the <HI>Kings I&s;lands:</HI> She was &s;ent out well appointed with armed Men to watch our motion. The 25th day Captain <HI>Harris</HI> came to us, having cleaned his Ship. The 26th day we went again towards <HI>Tabago;</HI> our Fleet now, upon Captain <HI>Harris</HI> joining us again, con&s;i&s;ted of 10 Sail. We arrived at <HI>Tabago</HI> the 28th day: there our Pri&s;oners were examin'd concerning the &s;trength of <HI>Panama;</HI> for now we thought our &s;elves &s;trong enough for &s;uch an Enterprize, being near 1000 Men. Out of the&s;e on occa&s;ion, we could have landed 900: but our Pri&s;oners gave us &s;mall Encon|ragement to it, for they a&s;&s;ured us, that all the &s;trength of the Country was there, and that many Men were come from <HI>Portobel,</HI> be&s;ides its own In|habitants, who of them&s;elves were more in number than we. The&s;e rea&s;ons, together with the &s;trength of the place (which hath a high Wall) deterr'd us from attempting it. While we lay here at <HI>Tabago,</HI> &s;ome of our Men burnt the Town on the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="228">
The 4th of <HI>May</HI> we &s;ailed hence again bound for the <HI>Kings I&s;lands,</HI> and there we continued crui&s;ing from one end of the&s;e I&s;lands to the other: till on the 22d day, Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Gronet,</HI> went to <HI>Pacheque,</HI> leaving the re&s;t of the Fleet at anchor at St. <HI>Paul's I&s;land.</HI> From <HI>Pacheque</HI> we &s;ent 2 Canoas to the I&s;land <HI>Chepelio,</HI> in hopes to get a Pri&s;oner there. The 25th day our Canoas return'd from <HI>Che|pelio,</HI> with three Pri&s;oners which they took there: They were Seamen belonging to <HI>Panama,</HI> who &s;aid that Provi&s;ion was &s;o &s;carce and dear there, that the poor were almo&s;t &s;tarved; being hindred by us from tho&s;e common and daily &s;upplies of Plantains, which they did formerly enjoy from the I&s;lands; e&s;pecially from tho&s;e two of <HI>Chepelia</HI> and <HI>Tabago.</HI> That the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama</HI> had &s;trictly ordered, that none &s;hould adventure to any of the I&s;lands for Plantains; but nece&s;&s;ity had obliged them to tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t the Pre&s;ident's Order. They far|ther reported, that the Fleet from <HI>Lima</HI> was ex|pected every day; for it was generally talked that they were come from <HI>Lima:</HI> and that the report at <HI>Panama</HI> was, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> was dead, and that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was crowned King. The 27th day Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> and Capt. <HI>Townley,</HI> al|&s;o came to <HI>Pacheque,</HI> where we lay, but Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Bark was gone in among the <HI>Kings I&s;lands</HI> for Plantains. The I&s;land <HI>Pacheque,</HI> as I have before related, is the Northermo&s;t of the <HI>Kings I&s;lands.</HI> It is a &s;mall low I&s;land about a League round. On the South-&s;ide of it there are 2 or 3 &s;mall I&s;lands, nei|ther of them half a mile round. Between <HI>Pacheque</HI> and the&s;e I&s;lands is a &s;mall Channel not above 6 or 7 paces wide, and about a Mile long. Through this Captain <HI>Townley</HI> made a bold run, being pre&s;t hard by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the fight I am going to &s;peak of, though he was ignorant whether there was a &s;ufficient depth of Water or not.

<P>The 28th day we had a very wet morning, for the Rains were come in, as they do u&s;ually in <HI>May,</HI> or <HI>June,</HI> &s;ooner or later; &s;o that <HI>May</HI> is here a very uncertain month. Hitherto, till within a few days we had good fair weather, and the Wind at N. N. E. but now the weather was altered, and the Wind at S. S. W.</P>
<P>However about eleven a Clock it cleared up, and we &s;aw the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet about 3 leagues W. N. W. from the I&s;land <HI>Pacheque,</HI> &s;tanding clo&s;e on a Wind to the Ea&s;t-ward; but they could not fetch the I&s;land by a league. We were riding a league S. E. from the I&s;land, between it and the Main; only Captain <HI>Gronet</HI> was about a mile to the Northward of us near the I&s;land; he weighed &s;o &s;oon as they came in &s;ight, and &s;tood over for the Main; and we lay &s;till expecting when he would tack and come to us: but he took care to keep him&s;elf out of harms way.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and <HI>Townley</HI> came aboard of Cap|tain <HI>Davis</HI> to order how to engage the Enemy, who we &s;aw came purpo&s;ely to fight us, they being in all 14 Sail, be&s;ides Periagoes, rowing with 12 and 14 Oars apiece. Six Sail of them were Ships of good force: fir&s;t the Admiral 48 Guns, 450 Men; the Vice-Admiral 40 Guns, 400 Men; the Rear-Admiral 36 Guns, 360 Men; a Ship of 24 Guns, 300 Men; one of 18 Guns, 250 Men; and one of eight Guns, 200 Men; 2 great Fire&s;hips, 6 Ships only with &s;mall Arms, having 800 Men on board them all; be&s;ides 2 or 3 hundred Men in Periagoes. This Account of their Strength we had afterwards from Captain <HI>Knight,</HI> who being to the Windward on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pern,</HI> took Pri&s;oners, of whom he had this Information, being what they brought

<P>Our Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 10 Sail: fir&s;t Captain <HI>Da+vis</HI> 36 Guns, 156 Men, mo&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> 16 Guns, 140 Men all <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> The&s;e were the only Ships of force that we had; the re&s;t having none but &s;mall Arms. Captain <HI>Townley</HI> had 110 Men, all <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Captain <HI>Gronet</HI> 308 Men, all <HI>French.</HI> Captain <HI>Harris</HI> 100 Men, mo&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Captain <HI>Branly</HI> 36 Men, &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ome <HI>French. Davis</HI> his Tender 8 Men; <HI>Swan</HI>'s Tender 8 Men; <HI>Townley</HI>'s Bark 80 Men; and a &s;mall Bark of thirty Tuns made a Fire&s;hip, with a Canoas Crew in her. We had in all 960 Men. But Captain <HI>Gronet</HI> came not to us till all was over, yet we were not di&s;|couraged at it, but re&s;olved to fight them; for be|ing to Windward of the Enemy, we had it at our choice, whether we would fight or not. It was 3 a Clock in the afternoon when we weighed, and being all under &s;ail, we bore down right afore the wind on our Enemies, who kept clo&s;e on a Wind to come to us; but night came on without any thing, be&s;ide the exchanging of a few &s;hot on each &s;ide. When it grew dark the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admiral put out a light, as a &s;ignal for his Fleet to come to an Anchor. We &s;aw the light in the Admirals top, which continued about half an hour, and then it was taken down. In a &s;hort time after we &s;aw the light again, and being to Windward we kept under &s;ail, &s;uppo&s;ing the light had been in the Ad|mirals top; but as it proved, this was only a &s;tra|tagem of theirs; for this light was put out the &s;e|cond time at one of their Barks Topma&s;t-head, and
<PB N="209" REF="231">
then &s;he was &s;ent to Leeward; which deceived us: for we thought &s;till the Light was in the Admiral's Top, and by that means thought our &s;elves to wind|ward of them.</P>
<P>In the Morning therefore, contrary to our ex|pectation, we found they had got the Weather-gage of us, and were coming upon us with full Sail; &s;o we ran for it, and after a running Fight all day, and ha|ving taken a turn almo&s;t round the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> we came to an Anchor again at the I&s;le of <HI>Pacheque,</HI> in the very &s;ame place from whence we &s;et out in the Morning.</P>
<P>Thus ended this days Work, and with it all that we had been projecting for 5 or 6 Months; when in&s;tead of making our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet and Trea&s;ure, we were glad to e&s;cape them; and owed that too, in a great mea&s;ure to their want of Courage to pur&s;ue their Advantage.</P>
<P>The 30th day in the Morning when we looked out we &s;aw the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet all together 3 leagues to Leeward of us at an Anchor. It was but little Wind till 10 a Clock, and then &s;prung up a &s;mall Breeze at South, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet went away to <HI>Panama.</HI> What lo&s;s they had I know not; we lo&s;t but one Man: And having held a Con&s;ult, we re|&s;olved to go to the Keys of <HI>Quibo</HI> or <HI>Cohaya,</HI> to &s;eek Capt. <HI>Harris,</HI> who was forc'd away from us in the Fight; that being the place appointed for our Ren|dezvous upon any &s;uch Accident. As for <HI>Gronet,</HI> he &s;aid his Men would not &s;uffer him to joyn us in the Fight: But we were not &s;atisfied with that ex|cu&s;e; &s;o we &s;uffered him to go with us to the I&s;les of <HI>Quiboa,</HI> and there ca&s;hiered our cowardly Com|panion. Some were for taking from him the Ship which we had given him: But at length he was &s;uffered to keep it with his Men, and we &s;ent them away in it to &s;ome other place.</P>

Point <HI>Garachina</HI> and the <HI>Kings I&s;lands.</HI> The Wind was ot S. S. W. rainy Weather, with Torna|does of Thunder and Lightning.

S. W. from <HI>Pacheca.</HI></P>
<P>In our pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Quibo.</HI> Captain <HI>Branly</HI> lo&s;t his Main-Ma&s;t; therefore he and all his Men left his Bark, and came aboard Captain <HI>Davis</HI> his Ship. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> al&s;o &s;prung his Main-top-Ma&s;t, and got up another; but while he was doing it, and we were making the be&s;t of our way, we lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and were now on the North &s;ide of the Bay; for this way all Ships mu&s;t pa&s;s from <HI>Panama,</HI> whether bound towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico</HI> or <HI>Peru.</HI> The 10th day we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Moro de Porcos,</HI> or the <HI>Mountain of Hogs.</HI> Why &s;o called, I know not: It is a high round Hill on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Lavelia.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI> runs out We&s;terly to the I&s;lands of <HI>Quibo;</HI> there are on this Coa&s;t ma|ny Rivers and Creeks, but none &s;o large as tho&s;e on the South &s;ide of the Bay. It is a Coa&s;t that is partly mountainous, partly low Land, and very thick of Woods bordering on the Sea; but a few leagues within Land it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of Savannahs, which are &s;tock'd with Bulls and Cows The Ri|vers on this &s;ide are not wholly de&s;titute of Gold, though not &s;o rich as the Rivers on the other &s;ide of the Bay. The Coa&s;t is but thinly inhabited, for except the Rivers that lead up to the Towns of <HI>Nata</HI> and <HI>Lavelia,</HI> I know of no other Settlement between <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Puebla Nova.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> may travel by Land from <HI>Panama</HI> through all the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> as being full of Savannahs; but towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> they cannot pa&s;s fur|ther than the River <HI>Cheapo:</HI> the Land there being &s;o full of thick Woods, and watered with &s;o many
<PB N="212" REF="234">
great Rivers, be&s;ides le&s;s Rivers and Creeks, that the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves, who inhabit there, cannot travel far without much trouble.</P>
<P>We met with very wet weather in our Voyage to <HI>Quibo;</HI> and with S. S. W. and &s;ometimes S. W. Winds, which retarded our Cour&s;e. It was the 15th day of <HI>June</HI> when we arrived at <HI>Quibo,</HI> and found there Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> whom we &s;ought. The I&s;land <HI>Quibo,</HI> or <HI>Cobaya,</HI> is in lat. 7 d. 14 m. North of the Equator. It is about 6 or 7 leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. The land is low, except only near the N. E. end. It is all over plentifully &s;tored with great tall flouri&s;hing Trees of many &s;orts; and there is good Water on the Ea&s;t and North-Ea&s;t &s;ides of the I&s;land. Here are &s;ome Deer, and plenty of pretty large black Monkies, who&s;e Fle&s;h is &s;weet, and whole&s;ome: be&s;ides a few Guanoes, and &s;ome Snakes. I know no other &s;ort of Land Animal on the I&s;land. There is a &s;hole runs out from the S E. point of the I&s;land, half a mile into the Sea; and a league to the North of this &s;hole point, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, there is a rock about a mile from the &s;hore, which at the la&s;t quarter ebb appears above Water. Be&s;ides the&s;e two places, there is no dan|ger on this &s;ide, but Ships may run within a quar|ter of a mile of the &s;hoar, and Anchor in 6, 8, 10, or 12 fathom, good clean Sand and Oaze.</P>
<P>There are many other I&s;lands, lying &s;ome on the S. W. &s;ide, others on the N. and N. E. &s;ides of this I&s;land; as the I&s;land <HI>Quicaro,</HI> which is a pretty large I&s;land S. W. of <HI>Quibo,</HI> and on the North of it is a &s;mall I&s;land called the <HI>Rancheria;</HI> on which I&s;land are plenty of <HI>Palma-Maria</HI> Trees. The <HI>Palma-Maria</HI> is a tall &s;traight bodied Tree, with a &s;mall Head, but very unlike the Palm-tree, notwith|&s;tanding the Name. It is greatly e&s;teemed for ma|king Ma&s;ts, being very tongh, as well as of a good length; for the grain of the Wood runs not &s;traight
<PB N="213" REF="235">
along it, but twi&s;ting gardually about it. The&s;e Trees grow in many places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and are fre|quently u&s;ed both by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> there for that u&s;e. The I&s;lands <HI>Canales</HI> and <HI>Cantarras,</HI> are &s;mall I&s;lands lying on the N. E. of <HI>Rancheria.</HI> The&s;e have all Channels to pa&s;s between, and good An|choring about them; and they are as well &s;tored with Trees and Water as <HI>Quibo.</HI> Sailing without them all, they appear to be part of the Main. The I&s;land <HI>Quibo</HI> is the large&s;t and mo&s;t noted; for al|though the re&s;t have Names, yet they are &s;eldom u&s;ed only for di&s;tinction &s;ake: the&s;e, and the re&s;t of this knot, pa&s;&s;ing all under the common name of the <HI>Keys of Quibo.</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> gave to &s;everal of the&s;e I&s;lands, the Names of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants and Gentlemen who were Owners of his Ship.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 16th. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> came to an Anchor by us: and then our Captains con&s;ulted about new methods to advance their Fortunes: and becau&s;e they were now out of hopes to get any thing at Sea, they re&s;olved to try what the Land would afford. They demanded of our Pilots, what Towns on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico</HI> they could carry us to. The City of <HI>Leon</HI> being the chiefe&s;t in the Country (any thing near us) though a pretty way within Land, was pitch'd on. But now we wanted Canoas to Land our Men, and we had no other way but to cut down Trees, and make as many as we had oc|ca&s;ion for, the&s;e I&s;lands affording plenty of large Trees fit for our purpo&s;e. While this was doing, we &s;ent 150 Men to take <HI>Puebla Nova</HI> (a Town upon the Main near the innermo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands) to get Provi&s;ion: It was in going to take this Town that Captain <HI>Sawkins</HI> was killed, in the year 1680. who was &s;ucceded by <HI>Sharp.</HI> Our Men took the Town with much ea&s;e, although there was more &s;trength of Men than when Captain <HI>Sawkins</HI> was kill'd. They returned again the 24th day, but got
<PB N="214" REF="236">
no Provi&s;ion there. They took an empty Bark in their way, and brought her to us.</P>
<P>The 5th day of <HI>July</HI> Captain <HI>Knight,</HI> mentioned in my la&s;t Chapter, came to us. He had been crui|&s;ing a great way to the We&s;tward, but got nothing be&s;ide a good Ship. At la&s;t, he went to the South|ward, as high as the Bay of <HI>Guiaquil,</HI> where he took a Bark-log, or pair of Bark-logs as we call it, laden chiefly with Flower. She had other goods, as Wine, Oyl, Brandy, Sugar, Soap, and Leather of Goat-&s;kins; and he took out as much of each as he had occa&s;ion for, and then turned her away again. The Ma&s;ter of the Float told him, that the Kings Ships were gone from <HI>Lima</HI> towards <HI>Panama:</HI> that they carried but half the Kings Trea&s;ure with them, for fear of us, although they had all the &s;trength that the Kingdom could afford: that all the Merchants Ships which &s;hould have gone with them were laden and lying at <HI>Payta,</HI> where they were to wait for further Orders. Captain <HI>Knight</HI> having but few Men, did not dare to go to <HI>Payta,</HI> where, if he had been better provided, he might have taken them all; but he made the be&s;t of his way into the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> in hopes to find us there inriched with the Spoils of the <HI>Lima</HI> Fleet; but coming to the <HI>Kings I&s;lands,</HI> he had advice by a Pri&s;oner, that we had ingaged with their Fleet, but were wor&s;ted, and &s;ince that made our way to the We&s;tward; and therefore he came hither to &s;eek us. He pre&s;ently con&s;orted with us, and &s;et his Men to work to make Canoas. Every Ships company made for them&s;elves, but we all helped each other to launch them; for &s;ome were made a mile from the Sea.</P>
<P>The manner of making a Canoa is, after cutting down a large long Tree, and &s;quaring the upper|mo&s;t &s;ide, and then turning it upon the flat &s;ide, to &s;hape the oppo&s;ite &s;ide for the bottom. Then again
<PB N="215" REF="237">
they turn her, and dig the in&s;ide; boring al&s;o three holes in the bottom, one before, one in the middle, and one aba&s;t, thereby to gage the thicke&s;t of the bottom; for otherwi&s;e we might cut the bottom thinner than is convenient. We left the bottoms commonly about 3 Inches thick, and the &s;ides 2 Inches thick below, and one and an half at the top. One or both of the ends we &s;harpen to a point.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> made two very large Canoas, one was 36 foot long, and 5 or 6 feet wide; the other 32 foot long, and near as wide as the other. In a Months time we fini&s;hed our Bu&s;ine&s;s and were rea|dy to &s;ail. Here Capt. <HI>Harris</HI> went to lay his Ship a-ground to clean her, but &s;he being old and rotten fell in pieces: And therefore he and all his Men went aboard of Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan.</HI> While we lay here we &s;truck Turtle every day, for they were now very plentiful: But from <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to <HI>March</HI> here are not many. The 18th day of <HI>July, John Ro&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and 14 Men more belonging to Capt. <HI>Gronet,</HI> having made a new Canoa, came in her to Capt. <HI>Davis,</HI> and de&s;ired to &s;erve under him; and Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> accepted of them, becau&s;e they had a Canoa of their own.</P>
<P>The 20th day of <HI>July</HI> we &s;ailed from <HI>Quibo,</HI> bend|ing our cour&s;e for <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> which is the Port for <HI>Leon,</HI> the City that we now de&s;igned to attempt. We were now 640 Men in 8 Sail of Ships, com|manded by Capt. <HI>Davis,</HI> Capt. <HI>Swan,</HI> Capt. <HI>Town|ley</HI> and Capt. <HI>Knight,</HI> with a Fire&s;hip and three Tenders, which la&s;t had not a con&s;tant Crew. We pa&s;t out between the River <HI>Quibo</HI> and the <HI>Rancheria,</HI> leaving <HI>Quibo</HI> and <HI>Quicaro</HI> on our Larboard &s;ide, and the <HI>Rancheria,</HI> with the re&s;t of the I&s;lands, and the Main on our Starboard &s;ide. The Wind at fir&s;t was at South South We&s;t: We coa&s;ted along &s;hore, pa&s;&s;ing by the Gulf of <HI>Nicoya,</HI> the Gulf of <HI>Dulce,</HI> and by the I&s;land <HI>Caneo.</HI> All this Coa&s;t is low Land
<PB N="216" REF="238">
overgrown with thick Woods, and there are but few inhabitants near the &s;hore. As we &s;ailed to the We&s;t|ward we had variable Winds, &s;ometimes S. W. and at W. S. W. and &s;ometimes at E. N. E. but we had them mo&s;t commonly at S. W. we had a Tornado or two every day, and in the Evening or in the Night, we had Land-winds at N. N. E.</P>
<P>The 8th day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> being in the lat. of 11 d. 20 m. by my ob&s;ervation, we &s;aw a high Hill in the Country, towring up like a Sugar-Loaf, which bore N. E. by N. We &s;uppo&s;ed it to be <HI>Volcan Vejo,</HI> by the &s;moak which a&s;cended from its top; therefore we &s;teered in North and made it plainer, and then knew it to be that <HI>Volcan,</HI> which is the Sea-mark for the Harbour for <HI>Ria Lexa;</HI> for, as I &s;aid before in Chap|ter the 5th, it is a very remarkable Mountain. When we had brought this Mountain to bear N. E. we got out all our Canoas, and provided to embark into them the next day.</P>
<P>The 9th day in the Morning, being about 8 leagues from the &s;hoar, we left our Ships under the charge of a few Men, and 520 of us went away in 31 Canoas, towing towards the Harbour of <HI>Ria Lexa.</HI> We had fair Weather and little Wind till 2 a Clock in the Afternoon, then we had a Tornado from the &s;hore, with much Thunder, Lightning and Rain, and &s;uch a gu&s;t of Wind, that we were all like to be foundred. In this extremity we put right afore the Wind, every Canoas crew making what &s;hift they could to avoid the Threatning Dan|ger. The &s;mall Canoas being mo&s;t light and buoyant, mounted nimbly over the Surges, but the great heavy Canoas lay like Logs in the Sea, ready to be &s;wallowed by every foaming Billow. Some of our Canoas were half full of Water, yet kept two Men con&s;tantly heaving it out. The fiercene&s;s of the Wind continued about half an hour, and a|bated by degrees; and as the Wind died away, &s;o
<PB N="217" REF="239">
the fury of the Sea abated: For in all hot Countries as I have ob&s;erved, the Sea is &s;oon rai&s;ed by the Wind, and as &s;oon down again when the Wind is gone, and therefore it is a Proverb among the Sea|men, <HI>Up Wind, up Sea, Down Wind, down Sea.</HI> At 7 a clock in the Evening it was quiet calm, and the Sea as &s;mooth as a Mill-pond. Then we tugg'd to get into the Shore, but finding we could not do it before Day, we rowed off again to keep our &s;elves out of &s;ight. By that time it was day, we were 5 Leagues from the Land, which we thought was far enough off Shore. Here we intended to lie till the Evening, but at 3 a clock in the Afternoon we had another Tornado, more fierce than that which we had the day before. This put us in greater peril of our Lives, but did not la&s;t &s;o long. As &s;oon as the violence of the Tornado was over, we rowed in for the &s;hore, and entred the Harbor in the Night: The Creek which leads towards <HI>Leon,</HI> lieth on the S. E. &s;ide of the Harbour. Our Pilot being very well acquainted here, carried us into the Mouth of it, but could carry us no farther till day, be|cau&s;e it is but a &s;mall Creek, and there are other Creeks like it. The next Morning, a&s;&s;oon as it was light, we rowed into the Creek, which is very nar|row; the Land on both &s;ides lying &s;o low, that every Tide it is overflown with the Sea. This &s;ort of Land produceth red Mangrove-Trees, which are here &s;o plentiful and thick, that there is no pa&s;&s;ing thro' them. Beyond the&s;e Mangroves, on the firm Land, clo&s;e by the &s;ide of the River, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built a Bre&s;twork, purpo&s;ely to hinder an Enemy from the landing. When we came in &s;ight of the Bre&s;twork, we rowed as fa&s;t as we could to get a&s;hore: The noi&s;e of our Oars allarmed the <HI>Indians</HI> who were &s;et to watch, and pre&s;ently they ran a|way towards the City of <HI>Leon,</HI> to give notice of our approach. We landed as &s;oon as we could, and

<P>The City of <HI>Leon</HI> is 20 Mile up in the Country: The way to it plain and even, thro' a Champion Country of long gra&s;&s;y Savannahs, and &s;pots of high Woods. About 5 Mile from the Landing-place there is a Sugar-work, 3 Mile farther there is ano|ther, and 2 Mile beyond that, there is a fine River to ford, which is not very deep, be&s;ides which, there is no Water in all the way, till you come to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, which is 2 Mile before you come to the City, and from thence it is a plea&s;ant &s;traight &s;andy way to <HI>Leon.</HI> This City &s;tands in a Plain not far from a high pecked Mountain, which oftentimes ca&s;ts forth fire and &s;moak from its top. It may be &s;een at Sea, and it is called the <HI>Volcan</HI> of <HI>Leon.</HI> The Hou&s;es of <HI>Leon</HI> are not high built, but &s;trong and large, with Gardens about them. The Walls are Stone, and the Covering of Pan-tile: There are 3 Churches and a Cathedral, which is the head Church in the&s;e parts. Our Countryman Mr. <HI>Gage,</HI> who travelled in the&s;e Parts, recommends it to the World as the plea&s;ante&s;t place in all <HI>America,</HI> and calls it the Paradice of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Indeed if we con&s;ider the Advantage of its Scituation, we may find it &s;urpa&s;&s;ing mo&s;t places for Health and Plea&s;ure in <HI>America;</HI> for the Country about it is of a &s;andy Soil, which &s;oon drinks up all the Rain that falls, to which the&s;e parts are much &s;ubject. It is en|compa&s;&s;ed with Savannahs; &s;o that they have the benefit of the Breezes coming from any Quarter; all which makes it a very healthy place. It is a place of no great trade, and therefore not rich in Money. Their Wealth lies in their Pa&s;tures, and Cattle, and Plantations of Sugar. It is &s;aid that they make Cordage here of Hemp; but if they have any &s;uch Manufactory, it is at &s;ome di&s;tance

from the Town, for here is no &s;ign of any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Thither our Men were now marching; they went from the Canoas about 8 a clock. Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> with 80 of the briske&s;t Men, marched be|fore, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> with 100 Men marched next, and Captain <HI>Davis</HI> with 170 Men marched next, and Captain <HI>Knight</HI> brought up the Rear. Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> who was near 2 mile a head of the re&s;t, met about 70 Hor&s;emen 4 mile before he came to the City, but they never &s;tood him. About 3 a clock Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> only with his 80 Men, en|tred the Town, and was briskly charged in a broad Street, with 170 or 200 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;emen, but 2 or 3 of their Leaders being knock'd down, the re&s;t fled. Their Foot con&s;i&s;ted of about 500 Men, which were drawn up in the Parade; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the&s;e parts make a large Square in every Town, tho' the Town it &s;elf be &s;mall. The Square is cal|led the Parade: commonly the Church makes one &s;ide of it, and the Gentlemens Hou&s;es with their Galleries about them, the other. But the Foot al|&s;o &s;eeing their Hor&s;e retire, left an empty City to Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> beginning to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> came in about 4 a clock. Captain <HI>Davis</HI> with his Men about 5, and Captain <HI>Knight,</HI> with as many Men as he could encourage to march, came in about 6, but he left many Men tired on the Road; the&s;e, as is u&s;ual, came drop|ping in one or two at a time, as they were able. The next morning the <HI>Spaniards</HI> kill'd one of our tired Men: he was a &s;tout old Grey-headed Man, aged about 84, who had &s;erved under <HI>Oliver</HI> in the time of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebellion; after which he was at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and had followed Privateering ever &s;ince. He would not accept of the offer our Men made him to tarry a&s;hoar, but &s;aid he would venture as far as the be&s;t of them: and when &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="220" REF="242">
by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he refu&s;ed to take Quarter, but di&s;charged his Gun among&s;t them, keeping a Pi&s;tol &s;till charged, &s;o they &s;hot him dead at a di|&s;tance. His name was <HI>Swan;</HI> he was a very mer|ry hearty old Man, and always u&s;ed to declare he would never take Quarter: But they took Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who was tired al&s;o; he was a Merchant belonging to Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and being carried before the Governour of <HI>Leon,</HI> was known by a <HI>Mulatta</HI> Wo|man that waited on him. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had lived ma|ny years in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and could &s;peak and write very good <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and it was there this <HI>Mulatta</HI> Woman remembred him. He being examin'd how many Men we were, &s;aid 1000 at the City, and 500 at the Canoas, which made well for us at the Canoas, who &s;traggling about every day, might ea|&s;ily have been de&s;troyed. But this &s;o daunted the Governour, that he did never offer to mole&s;t our Men, although he had with him above 1000 Men, as Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> gue&s;&s;ed. He &s;ent in a Flag of Truce about Noon, pretending to ran&s;om the Town, ra|ther than let it be burnt; but our Captains de|manded 300000 Pieces of Eight for its Ran&s;om, and as much Provi&s;ion as would victual 1000 Men 4 Months, and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to be ran&s;omed for &s;ome of their Pri&s;oners; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not intend to ran&s;om the Town, but only capitulated day af|ter day to prolong time, till they had got more Men. Our Captains therefore, con&s;idering the di|&s;tance that they were from the Canoas, re&s;olved to be marching down. The 14th day in the morning they ordered the City to be &s;et on fire, which was pre&s;ently done, and then they came away: But they took more time in coming down than in go|ing up. The 15th day in the morning, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent in Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and had a Gentlewoman in ex|change. Then our Captains &s;ent a Letter to the Governour, to acquaint him, that they intended
<PB N="221" REF="243">
next to vi&s;it <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> and de&s;ir'd to meet him there: they al&s;o relea&s;ed a Gentleman, on his promi&s;e of paying 150 Beefs for his Ran&s;om, and to deliver them to us at <HI>Ria Lexa;</HI> and the &s;ame day our Men came to their Canoas; where having &s;taid all night, the next Morning we all entred our Canoas, and came to the Harbour of <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> and in the after|noon our Ships came thither to an Anchor.</P>
<P>The Creek that leads to <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> lieth from the N. W. part of the Harbour, and it runs in Norther|ly. It is about 2 Leagues from the I&s;land in the Harbours Mouth to the Town; two thirds of the way it is broad, then you enter a narrow deep Creek, bordered on both &s;ides with Red Mangrove Trees, who&s;e Limbs reach almo&s;t from one &s;ide to the other. A mile from the Mouth of the Creek it turns away We&s;t. There the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made a very &s;trong Bre&s;twork, fronting towards the mouth of the Creek, in which were placed 100 Soldiers to hinder us from landing; and 20 Yards below that Bre&s;twork there was a Chain of great Trees placed cro&s;s the Creek, &s;o that 10 Men could have kept off 500 or 1000.</P>
<P>When we came in &s;ight of the Bre&s;twork we fired but two Guns, and they all run away: And we were afterwards near half an hour cutting the Boom or Chain. Here we landed, and marched to the Town of <HI>Ria Lexa,</HI> or <HI>Rea Lejo,</HI> which is a|bout a mile from hence. This Town &s;tands on a Plain by a &s;mall River. It is a pretty large Town with 3 Churches, and an Ho&s;pital that hath a fine Garden belonging to it: be&s;ides many large fair Hou&s;es, they all &s;tand at a good di&s;tance one from another, with Yards about them. This is a very &s;ickly place, and I believe hath need enough of an Ho&s;pital; for it is &s;eated &s;o nigh the Creeks and Swamps, that it is never free from a noi&s;om &s;mell The Land about it is a &s;trong yellow Clay: yet
<PB N="222" REF="244">
where the Town &s;tands it &s;eems to be Sand. Here are &s;everal &s;ort of Fruits, as Guavo's, Pine-apples, Melons, and Prickle-Pears. The Pine-apple and Melon are well known.</P>
<P>The Guava-Fruit grows on a hard &s;crubbed Shrub, who&s;e Bark is &s;mooth and whiti&s;h, the Branches pretty long and &s;mall, the Leaf &s;omewhat like the Leaf of Hazel, the Fruit much like a Pear, with a thin rind; it is full of &s;mall hard Seeds, and it may be eaten while it is green, which is a thing very rare in the <HI>Indies:</HI> For mo&s;t Fruit, both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> is full of clammy, white, un&s;a|vory Juice, before it is ripe, though plea&s;ant enough afterwards. When this Fruit is ripe it is yellow, &s;oft, and very plea&s;ant. It bakes as well as a Pear, and it may be coddled, and it makes good Pies. There are of divers &s;orts, different in &s;hape, ta&s;te, and Colour. The in&s;ide of &s;ome is yellow, of others red. When this Fruit is eaten green, it is binding, when ripe, it is loo&s;ening.</P>
<P>The Prickle-Pear, Bu&s;h, or Shrub, of about 4 or 5 foot high, grows in many places of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and mo&s;t other I&s;lands there; and on the Main in &s;everal places. This prickly Shrub delights mo&s;t in barren &s;andy Grounds; and they thrive be&s;t in places that are near the Sea; e&s;pecially where the Sand is &s;alti&s;h. The Tree, or Shrub, is 3 or 4 foot high, &s;preading forth &s;everal branches, and on each branch 2 or 3 leaves. The&s;e leaves (if I may call them &s;o) are round, as broad every way as the Palm of a Man's hand, and as thick; their &s;ub&s;tance like Hou&s;eleek: the&s;e leaves are fenced round with &s;trong prickles above an inch long. The Fruit grows at the farther edge of the leaf: it is as big as a large Plumb, growing &s;mall near the leaf, and big towards the top, where it opens like a Medlar. This Fruit at fir&s;t is green like the leaf, from whence it &s;prings with &s;mall Prickles
<PB N="223" REF="245">
about it; but when ripe it is of a deep red colour. The in&s;ide is full of &s;mall black Seeds, mixt with a certain red Pulp, like thick Syrup: It is very plea&s;ant in ta&s;te, cooling, and refre&s;hing; but if a Man eats 15 or 20 of them they will colour his Water, making it look like Blood. This I have often experienced, yet found no harm by it.</P>
<P>There are many Sugar-works in the Country, and E&s;tantions or Beef Farms: There is al&s;o a great deal of Pitch, Tar and Cordage, made in the Country, which is the chief of their Trade. This Town we approached without any oppo&s;ition, and found no|thing but empty Hou&s;es; be&s;ides &s;uch things as they could not, or would not carry away, which were chiefly about 500 Packs of Flower, brought hither in the great Ship that we left at <HI>Amapalla,</HI> and &s;ome Pitch, Tar and Cordage. The&s;e things we wanted, and therefore we &s;ent them all aboard. Here we received 150 Beefs, promi&s;ed by the Gentleman that was relea&s;ed coming from <HI>Leon;</HI> be&s;ides, we vi&s;ited the Beef-Farms every day, and the Sugar-Works, going in &s;mall Companies of 20 or 30 Men, and brought away every Man his Load; for we found no Hor&s;es, which if we had, yet they ways were &s;o wet and dirty, that they would not have been &s;erviceable to us. We &s;tayed here from the 17th till the 24th day, and then &s;ome of our de|&s;tructive Crew &s;et fire to the Hou&s;es: I know not by who&s;e order, but we marched away and left them burning; at the Bre&s;t-work we imbarked into our Canoas and returned aboard our Ships.</P>
<P>The 25th day Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> broke off Con&s;ort&s;hip; for Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> was minded to return again on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> but Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> de&s;ired to go farther to the We&s;t|ward. I had till this time been with Capt. <HI>Davis,</HI> but now left him, and went aboard of Capt.
<PB N="224" REF="246">
<HI>Swan.</HI> It was not from any di&s;like to my old Cap|tain, but to get &s;ome knowledge of the Northern Parts of this Continent of <HI>Mexico:</HI> And I knew that Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> determined to Coa&s;t it as far North, as he thought convenient, and then pa&s;s over for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> which was a way very agreeable to my In|clination. Capt. <HI>Townley,</HI> with his two Barks, was re&s;olved to keep us Company; but Capt. <HI>Knight</HI> and Capt. <HI>Harris</HI> followed Captain <HI>Davis.</HI> The 27th day in the Morning Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> with his Ships went out of the Harbour, having a fre&s;h Land Wind. They were in Company, Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s Ship with Capt. <HI>Harris</HI> in her; Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s Bark and Fire&s;hip, and Capt. <HI>Knight</HI> in his own Ship, in all 4 Sail. Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> took his la&s;t farewel of him by firing 15 Guns, and he fired 11 in return of the Civility.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here &s;ome time afterwards to fill our Water and cut Fire-wood; but our Men, who had been very healthy till now, began to fall down apace in Fevers. Whether it was the badne&s;s of the Water, or the unhealthine&s;s of the Town was the cau&s;e of it we did not know; but of the two, I rather believe it was a di&s;temper we got at <HI>Ria Lexa;</HI> for it was reported that they had been vi|&s;ited with a Malignant Fever in that Town, which had occa&s;ioned many People to abandon it; and although this Vi&s;itation was over with them, yet their Hou&s;es and Goods might &s;till retain &s;omewhat of the Infection, and communicate the &s;ame to us.</P>
<P>I the rather believe this, becau&s;e it afterwards raged very much, not only among us, but al&s;o among Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and his Men, as he told me him&s;elf &s;ince, when I met him in <HI>England:</HI> Him&s;elf had like to have died, as did &s;everal of his and our Men. The 3d day of <HI>September</HI> we turned a&s;hore all our Pri&s;oners and Pilots, they being unacquainted fur|ther to the We&s;t, which was the Coa&s;t that we de|&s;igned
<PB N="225" REF="247">
to vi&s;it: for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have very little Trade by Sea beyond the River <HI>Lempa,</HI> a little to the North We&s;t of this place.</P>
<P>About 10 a clock in the morning, the &s;ame day we went from hence, &s;teering We&s;tward, being in company 4 Sail, as well as they who left us, <HI>viz.</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Bark, and Capt. <HI>Townley</HI> and his Bark, and about 340 Men.</P>
<P>We met with very bad weather as we &s;ailed along this Coa&s;t: &s;eldom a day pa&s;t but we had one or two violent Tornadoes, and with them very fright|ful Fla&s;hes of Lightnings and Claps of Thunder; I did never meet with the like before nor &s;ince. The&s;e Tornadoes commonly came out of the N. E. the Wind did not la&s;t long, but blew very fierce for the time. When the Tornadoes were over we had the Wind at W. &s;ometimes at W. S. W. and S. W. and &s;ometimes to the North of the We&s;t, as far as the N. W.</P>
<P>We kept at a good di&s;tance off &s;hoar, and &s;aw no land till the 14th day; but then, being in lat. 12 d. 50 m. the Volcan of <HI>Guatimala</HI> appeared in &s;ight. This is a very high Mountain with two peeks or heads, appearing like two Sugar-loaves. It often belches forth Flames of Fire and Smoak from between the two heads; and this, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do report, happens chiefly in tempe&s;tuous weather. It is called &s;o from the City <HI>Guatimala,</HI> which &s;tands near the foot of it, about 8 leagues from the South Sea, and by report, 40 or 50 leagues from the Gulf of <HI>Matique</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> in the North Seas. This City is famous for many rich Commodities that are produced thereabouts (&s;ome almo&s;t peculiar to this Country) and yearly &s;ent into <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially 4 rich Dyes, Indico, Otta or Anatta, Silve&s;ter, and Cochineel.</P>
<P>Indico is made of an Herb which grows a foot and half or two foot high, full of &s;mall Branches;
<PB N="226" REF="248">
and the Branches full of Leaves, re&s;embling the Leaves which grow on Flax, but more thick and &s;ub&s;tantial. They cut this Herb or Shrub and ca&s;t it into a large Ci&s;tern made in the Ground for that purpo&s;e, which is half full of Water. The Indico Stalk or Herb remains in the Water till all the leaves, and I think, the &s;kin, rind, or bark rot off, and in a manner di&s;&s;olve: but if any of the leaves &s;hould &s;tick fa&s;t, they force them off by much labour, to&s;&s;ing and tumbling the Ma&s;s in the Water till all the pulpy &s;ub&s;tance is di&s;&s;olved. Then the Shrub, or woody part, is taken out, and the Water which is like Ink, being di&s;turbed no more, &s;ettles, and the Indico falls to the bottom of the Ci&s;tern like Mud. When it is thus &s;ettled they draw off the Water, and take the Mud and lay it in the Sun to dry: which there becomes hard, as you &s;ee it brought home.</P>
<P>Otta, or Anatta, is a red &s;ort of Dye. It is made of a red Flower that grows on Shrubs 7 or 8 foot high. It is thrown into a Ci&s;tern of Water as the Indico is, but with this difference, that there is no &s;talk, nor &s;o much as the head of the Flower, but only the Flower it &s;elf pull'd off from the head, as you peel Ro&s;e-leaves from the bud. This remains in the Water till it rots, and by much jumbling it di&s;&s;olves to a liquid &s;ub&s;tance, like the Indico; and being &s;ettled and the Water drawn off, the red Mud is made up into Rolls or Cakes, and laid in the Sun to dry. I did never &s;ee any made but at a place called the <HI>Angels</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> at Sir <HI>Tho. Muddiford</HI>'s Plantations, about 20 years &s;ince; but was grubb'd up while I was there, and the Ground otherwi&s;e employed. I do believe there is none any where el&s;e on <HI>Jamaica:</HI> and even this probably was owing to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they had that I&s;land. Indico is common enough in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> I ob&s;erved they planted it mo&s;t in &s;andy Ground: they &s;ow
<PB N="227" REF="249">
great Fields of it, and I think they &s;ow it every year; but I did never &s;ee the Seeds it bears. In|dico is produced all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> on mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribbe I&s;lands,</HI> as well as the Main; yet no part of the Main yields &s;uch great quantities both of Indico and Otta as this Country about <HI>Guatimala.</HI> I believe that Otta is made now only by the <HI>Spani|ards;</HI> for &s;ince the de&s;troying that at the <HI>Angels</HI> Plantation in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I have not heard of any Improvement made of this Commodity by our Country-men any where; and as to <HI>Jamaica</HI> I have &s;ince been informed, that 'tis wholly left off there. I know not what quantities either of Indico or Ot|ta are made at <HI>Cuba</HI> or <HI>Hi&s;paniola:</HI> but the place mo&s;t u&s;ed by our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sloops for the&s;e things is the I&s;land <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> where our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Tra|ders did u&s;e to buy Indico for 3 Rials, and Otta for 4 Rials the Pound, which is but 2 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> of our Money: and yet at the &s;ame time Otta was worth in <HI>Jamaica</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> the Pound, and Indico 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> the Pound; and even this al&s;o paid in Goods; by which means alone they got 50 or 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Our Traders had not then found the way of trading with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> but Captain <HI>Coxon</HI> went thither (as I take it) at the be|ginning of the Year 1679, under pretence to cut Logwood, and went into the Gulf of <HI>Matique,</HI> which is in the bottom of that Bay. There he landed with his Canoas and took a whole Store|hou&s;e full of Indico and Otta in Che&s;ts, piled up in &s;everal parcels, and marked with different marks ready to be &s;hipt off aboard two Ships that then lay in the road purpo&s;ely to take it in; but the&s;e Ships could not come at him, it being &s;hole|water. He opened &s;ome of the Che&s;ts of Indico, and &s;uppo&s;ing the other Che&s;ts to be all of the &s;ame &s;pecies ordered his Men to carry them away. They immediately &s;et to work, and took the neare&s;t at
<PB N="228" REF="250">
hand; and having carried out one heap of Che&s;ts, they &s;eized on another great pile of a different mark from the re&s;t, intending to carry them away next. But a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman, their Pri&s;oner, knowing that there was a great deal more than they could carry away, de&s;ired them to take only &s;uch as belonged to the Merchants, (who&s;e marks he undertook to &s;hew them) and to &s;pare &s;uch as had the &s;ame mark with tho&s;e in that great Pile they were then entring upon; becau&s;e, he &s;aid, tho&s;e Che&s;ts belonged to the Ship Captains, who fol|lowing the Seas, as them&s;elves did, he hoped they would, for that rea&s;on, rather &s;pare their Goods than the Merchants. They con&s;ented to his Reque&s;t; but upon their opening their Che&s;ts (which was not before they came to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> whereby conni|vance they were permitted to &s;ell them) they found that the <HI>Don</HI> had been to &s;harp for them; the few Che&s;ts which they had taken of the &s;ame mark with the great Pile proving to be Otto, of greater value by far than the other; whereas they might as well have loaded the whole Ship with Otto, as with Indico.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cochineel</HI> is an In&s;ect, bred in a &s;ort of Fruit much like the Prickle-Pear. The Tree or Shrub that bears it is like the Prickle-Pear Tree, about 5 foot high, and &s;o prickly; only the Leaves are not quite &s;o big, but the Fruit is bigger. On the top of the Fruit there grows a red Flower: This Flow|er, when the Fruit is ripe, falls down on the top of the Fruit which then begins to open, and covers it &s;o, that no Rain nor Dew can wet the in&s;ide. The next day, or two days after its falling down, the Flower being then &s;corched away by the heat of the Sun, the Fruit opens as broad as the mouth of a Pint Pot, and the in&s;ide of the Fruit is by this time &s;ull of &s;mall red In&s;ects, with curious thin Wings. As they were bred here, &s;o here they would die
<PB N="229" REF="251">
for want of food, and rot in their hu&s;ks, (having by this time eaten up their mother Fruit) did not the <HI>Indians,</HI> who plant large fields of the&s;e Trees, when once they perceive the Fruit open, take care to drive them out: for they &s;pread under the branch|es of the Tree a large Linnen Cloth, and then with &s;ticks they &s;hake the branches, and &s;o di&s;turb the poor In&s;ects, that they take wing to be gone, yet hovering &s;till over the head of their native Tree, but the heat of the Sun &s;o di&s;orders them, that they pre&s;ently fall down dead on the Cloth &s;pread for that purpo&s;e, where the <HI>Indians</HI> let them remain 2 or 3 days longer, till they are thoroughly dry. When they fly up they are red, when they fall down they are black; and when fir&s;t they are quite dry they are white as the &s;heet wherein they lie, though the Colour change a little after. The&s;e yield the much e&s;teemed Scarlet. The Cochineel|trees are called by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> Toona's: They are planted in the Country about <HI>Guatimala,</HI> and about <HI>Cheape</HI> and <HI>Guaxaca,</HI> all 3 in the Kingdom of <HI>Mexi|co.</HI> The Silve&s;ter is a red Grain growing in a Fruit much re&s;embling the Cochineel-fruit; as doth al&s;o the Tree that bears it. There fir&s;t &s;hoots forth a yellow Flower, then comes the Fruit, which is longer than the Cochineel Fruit. The Fruit being ripe opens al&s;o very wide. The in&s;ide being full of the&s;e &s;mall Seeds or Grains, they fall out with the lea&s;t touch or &s;hake. The <HI>Indians</HI> that gather them hold a Di&s;h under to receive the Seed, and then &s;hake it down. The&s;e Trees grow wild; and 8 or 10 of the&s;e Fruits will yield an ounce of Seed: but of the Cochineel-fruits, 3 or 4 will yield an ounce of In&s;ects.

<PB N="230" REF="252">
I met a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman that had lived 30 years in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;ome years where the&s;e grow; and from him I had the&s;e relations. He was a ve|ry Intelligent Per&s;on, and pretended to be well ac|quainted in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy:</HI> therefore I exa|mined him in many particulars concerning that Bay, where I was well acquainted my &s;elf, living there 3 years. He gave very true and pertinent an&s;wers to all my demands, &s;o that I could have no di&s;tru&s;t of what he related.</P>
<P>When we fir&s;t &s;aw the Mountain of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> we were by judgment 25 leagues di&s;tance from it. As we came nearer the Land it appeared higher and plainer, yet we &s;aw no Fire, but a little &s;moak pro|ceeding from it. The Land by the Sea was of a good height, yet but low in compari&s;on with that in the Country. The Sea for about 8 or 10 leagues from the &s;hoar, was full of floating Trees, or Drift-Wood, as it is called, (of which I have &s;een a great deal, but no where &s;o much as here,) and Pumice|&s;tones floating, which probably are thrown out of the burning Mountains, and wa&s;hed down to the &s;hoar by the Rains, which are very violent and frequent in this Country; and on the &s;ide of <HI>Hon|duras</HI> it is exce&s;&s;ively wet.</P>
<P>The 24th day we were in lat. 14 d. 30 m. North, and the Weather more &s;ettled. Then Captain <HI>Townley</HI> took with him 106 Men in 9 Canoas, and went away to the We&s;tward, where he intended to Land, and romage in the Country for &s;ome refre&s;hment for our &s;ick Men, we having at this time near half our Men &s;ick, and many were dead &s;ince we left <HI>Ria Lexa.</HI> We in the Ships lay &s;till with our Top&s;ails furled, and our Cor&s;es or lower Sails hal'd up this day and the next, that Captain <HI>Townley</HI> might get the &s;tart of us.</P>
<P>The 26th day we made &s;ail again, coa&s;ting to the We&s;tward, having the Wind at North and fair
<PB N="231" REF="253">
weather. We ran along by a tract of very high Land which came from the Ea&s;tward, more within Land than we could &s;ee, after we fell in with it, it bare us company for about 10 leagues, and ended with a pretty gentle de&s;cent towards the We&s;t.</P>
<P>There we had a perfect view of a plea&s;ant low Country, which &s;eemed to be rich in Pa&s;turage for Cattle. It was plentifully furni&s;hed with Groves of green Trees, mixt among the gra&s;&s;y Savannahs: Here the Land was fenced from the Sea with high &s;andy Hills, for the Waves all along this Coa&s;t run high, and beat again&s;t the &s;hoar very boi&s;terou&s;ly, making the Land wholly unapproachable in Boats or Canoas: So we coa&s;ted &s;till along by this low Land, 8 or 9 leagues farther, keeping clo&s;e to the &s;hoar for fear of mi&s;&s;ing Captain <HI>Townley.</HI> We lay by in the Night, and in the Day made an ea&s;ie &s;ail.</P>
<P>The 2d day of <HI>October,</HI> Captain <HI>Townley</HI> came a|board; he had coa&s;ted along &s;hoar in his Canoas, &s;eeking for an entrance, but found none. At la&s;t, being out of hopes to find any Bay, Creek, or Ri|ver, into which he might &s;afely enter, he put a|&s;hoar on a &s;andy Bay, but over&s;et all his Canoas; he had one Man drowned, and &s;everal lo&s;t all their Arms, and &s;ome of them that had not waxt up their Cartrage or Catouche Boxes, wet all their Powder. Captain <HI>Townley</HI> with much ado got a|&s;hoar, and dragged the Canoas up dry on the Bay; then every Man &s;earched his Catouche-Box, and drew the wet Powder out of his Gun, and pro|vided to march into the Country, but finding it full of great Creeks which they could not ford, they were forced to return again to their Canoas. In the night they made good fires to keep them&s;elves warm; the next morning 200 <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> fell on them, but were immediately repul&s;ed, and made greater &s;peed back than they had done for|ward.
<PB N="232" REF="254">
Captain <HI>Townley</HI> followed them, but not far For fear of his Canoas. The&s;e Men came from <HI>Te|guantapeque,</HI> a Town that Captain <HI>Townley</HI> went chiefly to &s;eek, becau&s;e the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Books make mention of a large River there; but whether it was run away at this time, or rather Captain <HI>Townley</HI> and his Men were &s;hort-&s;ighted, I know not; but they could not find it.</P>
<P>Upon his return we pre&s;ently made &s;ail, coa&s;ting &s;till We&s;tward, having the Wind at E N. E. fair weather and a fre&s;h gale. We kept within 2 mile of the &s;hoar, &s;ounding all the way; and found at 6 miles di&s;tance from Land 19 fathom; at 8 miles di&s;tance 21 fathom, gro&s;s Sand. We &s;aw no open|ing, nor &s;ign of any place to land at, &s;o we &s;ailed about 20 leagues farther, and came to a &s;mall high I&s;land called <HI>Tangola,</HI> were there is good anchor|ing. The I&s;land is indifferently well furni&s;hed with Wood and Water, and lieth about a league from the &s;hoar. The Main again&s;t the I&s;land is pretty high champion Savannah Land by the Sea; but 2 or 3 leagues within Land it is higher, and very woody.</P>
<P>We coa&s;ted a league farther and came to <HI>Guatulco.</HI> This Port is in lat. 15 d. 30 m. it is one of the be&s;t in all this Kingdom of <HI>Mexico.</HI> Near a mile from the mouth of the Harbour, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, there is a little I&s;land clo&s;e by the &s;hoar; and on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the mouth of the Harbour there is a great hollow Rock, which by the continual work|ing of the Sea in and out makes a great noi&s;e, which may be heard a great way. Every Surge that comes in forceth the Water out of a little hole on its top, as out of a Pipe, from whence it flies out ju&s;t like the blowing of a Whale; to which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> al&s;o liken it. They call this Rock and Spout the <HI>Buffadore:</HI> upon what account I know not. Even
<PB N="233" REF="255">
in the calme&s;t Sea&s;ons the Sea beats in there, ma|king the Water &s;pout out at the hole: &s;o that this is always a good mark to find the Harbour by. The Harbour is about 3 mile deep, and one mile broad; it runs in N. W. But the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Harbour is be&s;t to ride in for &s;mall Ships; for there you may ride land-locked: whereas any where el&s;e you are open to the S. W. Winds, which often blow here. There is good clean Ground any where, and good gradual Soundings from 16 to 6 Fathom; it is bounded with a &s;mooth &s;andy Shoar, very good to land at; and at the bottom of the Harbour there is a fine Brook of fre&s;h Water running into the Sea. Here formerly &s;tood a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town, or Vil|lage, which was taken by Sir <HI>Francis Drake;</HI> but now there is nothing remaining of it, be&s;ide a little Chapel &s;tanding among the Trees, about 200 paces from the Sea. The Land appears in &s;mall &s;hort ridges parallel to the Shoar, and to each other; the innermo&s;t &s;till gradually higher than that nearer the Shoar; and they are all cloathed with very high flouri&s;hing Trees, that it is extraordinary plea&s;ant and delightful to behold at a di&s;tance: I have no where &s;een any thing like it.</P>
<P>At this place Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> who had been very &s;ick, came a&s;hoar, and all the &s;ick Men with him, and the Surgeon to tend them. Captain <HI>Townley</HI> again took a company of Men with him, and went into the Country to &s;eek for Hou&s;es or Inhabitants. He marched away to the Ea&s;tward, and came to the River <HI>Capalita;</HI> which is a &s;wift River, yet deep near the mouth, and is about a league from <HI>Guatulco.</HI> There 2 of his Men &s;wam over the River, and took 3 <HI>Indians</HI> that were placed there as Centinels, to watch for our coming. The&s;e could none of them &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> yet our Men by Signs made them under&s;tand, that they de&s;ired to know if there was any Town or Village near; who by the Signs
<PB N="234" REF="256">
which they made gave our Men to under&s;tand, that they could guide them to a Settlement: but there was no under&s;tanding by them, whether it was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Settlement, nor how far it was thi|ther. They brought the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> aboard with them, and the next day, which was the 6th day of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> Captain <HI>Townley</HI> with 140 Men (of whom I was one) went a&s;hoar again, taking one of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> with us for a Guide to conduct us to to this Settlement. Our Men that &s;tay'd aboard fill'd our Water, and cut Wood, and mended our Sails: and our <HI>Moskito</HI> Men &s;truck 3 or 4 Turtle every day They were a &s;mall &s;ort of Turtle, and not very &s;weet, yet very well e&s;teemed by us all, becau&s;e we had eaten no Fle&s;h a great while. The 8th day we returned out of the Country, having been about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> miles directly within Land before we came to any Settlement: There we found a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Village, and in it a great quantity of Vinello's drying in the Sun.</P>
<P>The Vinello is a little Cod full of &s;mall black Seeds; it is 4 or 5 Inches long, about the bigne&s;s of the Stem of a Tobacco Leaf, and when dried, much re&s;embling it: &s;o that our Privateers at fir&s;t have often thrown them away when they took any wondring why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould lay up Tobac|co Stems. This Cod grows on a &s;mall Vine, which climbs about, and &s;upports it &s;elf by the neighbour|ing Trees: it fir&s;t bears a yellow Flower, from whence the Cod afterwards proceeds. It is fir&s;t green, but when ripe it turns yellow; then the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> (who&s;e Manufacture it is, and who &s;ell it cheap to the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) gather it, and lay it in the Sun which makes it &s;oft; then it changes to a Che&s;nut colour. Then they frequently pre&s;s it between their Fingers, which makes it flat. If the <HI>Indians</HI> do any thing to them be&s;ide, I know not; but I have &s;een the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;leek them with Oil.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="257">
The&s;e Vines grow plentifully at <HI>Bocca-toro,</HI> where I have gathered and tried to cure them, but could not: which makes me think that the <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;ome Secret that I know not of to cure them. I have often askt the <HI>Spaniards</HI> how they were cured, but I never could meet with any could tell me. One Mr. <HI>Cree</HI> al&s;o, a very curious Per&s;on, who &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> well, and had been a Privateer all his Life, and 7 years a Pri&s;oner among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Porto|bel</HI> and <HI>Cartagena,</HI> yet upon all his Enquiry could not find any of them that under&s;tood it. Could we have learnt the Art of it, &s;everal of us would have gone to <HI>Bocca-toro</HI> yearly, at the dry Sea&s;on, and cured them, and freighted our Ve&s;&s;el. We there might have had Turtle enough for Food, and &s;tore of Vinello's. Mr. <HI>Cree</HI> fir&s;t &s;hewed me tho&s;e at <HI>Bocca-toro.</HI> At, or near a Town al&s;o, called <HI>Cai-hooca,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> the&s;e Cods are found. They are commonly &s;old for 3 pence a Cod among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and are &s;old by the Druggi&s;t, for they are much u&s;ed among Chocolate to perfume it. Some will u&s;e them among Tobacco, for it gives a delicate &s;cent. I never heard of any Vinello's but here in this Country, about <HI>Cai-hooca,</HI> and at <HI>Bocca-toro.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of this Village could &s;peak but little <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> They &s;eemed to be a poor innocent Peo|ple: and by them we under&s;tood, that here are ve|ry few <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the&s;e parts; yet all the <HI>Indians</HI> hereabout are under them. The Land from the Sea to their Hou&s;es is black Earth, mixt with &s;ome Stones and Rocks: all the way full of very high Trees.</P>
<P>The 10th day we &s;ent 4 Canoas to the We&s;t|ward, who were ordered to lie for us at Port <HI>An|gels;</HI> where we were in hopes that by &s;ome means or other they might get Pri&s;oners, that might give us a better account of the Country than

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> 1685. when we &s;et out of the Harbour of <HI>Guatulco</HI> with our Ships. The Land here lies along We&s;t, and a little South|erly for about 20 or 30 Leagues, and the Sea-winds are commonly at W. S. W. &s;ometimes at S. W. the Land-winds at N. We had now fair Weather, and but little Wind. We coa&s;ted along to the We&s;t|ward, keeping as near the &s;hole as we could for the benefit of the Land-winds, for the Sea-winds were right again&s;t us; and we found a Current &s;etting to the Ea&s;tward which kept us back, and obliged us to anchor at the I&s;land <HI>Sacrificio,</HI> which is a &s;mall green I&s;land about half a mile long. It lieth about a league to the We&s;t of <HI>Guatulco,</HI> and about half a mile from the Main. There &s;eems to be a fine Bay to the We&s;t of the I&s;land; but it is full of Rocks. The be&s;t riding is between the I&s;land and the Main: there you will have 5 or 6 fathom Water. Here runs a pretty &s;trong Tide; the Sea ri&s;eth and falleth 5 or 6 foot up and down.</P>
<P>The 18th day we &s;ailed from hence, coa&s;ting to the We&s;tward after our Canoas. We kept near the &s;hoar, which was all &s;andy Bays, the Country
<PB N="239" REF="261">
pretty high and woody, and a great Sea tumbling in upon the &s;hoar. The 22d day 2 of our Canoas came aboard, and told us they had been a great way to the We&s;tward, but could not find Port <HI>An|gels.</HI> They had attempted to land the day before, at a place where they &s;aw a great many Bulls and Cows feeding, in hopes to get &s;ome of them; but the Sea run &s;o high, that they over-&s;et both Ca|noas, and wet all their Arms, and lo&s;t 4 Guns, and had one Man drown'd, and with much ado got off again. They could give no account of the other 2 Canoas, for they lo&s;t company the fir&s;t night that they went from <HI>Guatulco,</HI> and had not &s;een them &s;ince.</P>
<P>We were now abre&s;t of <HI>Port Angels,</HI> though our Men in the Canoas did not know it; therefore we went in and anchored there. This is a broad open Bay, with 2 or 3 Rocks at the We&s;t-&s;ide. Here is good anchoring all over the Bay, in 30, or 20, or 12 fathom Water; but you mu&s;t ride open to all Winds, except the Land-winds, till you come into 12 or 13 fathom Water, then you are &s;heltered from the W. S. W. which are the common Trade|winds. The Tide ri&s;eth here about 5 foot; the Flood &s;ets to the N. E. and the Ebb to the S. W. The landing in this Bay is bad; the place of land|ing is clo&s;e by the We&s;t-&s;ide, behind a few Rocks; here always goes a great &s;well. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> com|pare this Harbour for goodne&s;s to <HI>Guatulco,</HI> but there is a great difference between them. For <HI>Cuatulco</HI> is almo&s;t Landlocked, and this an open road, and no one would ea&s;ily know it by their Cha|racter of it, but by its Marks and its Latitude, which is 15 d. North. For this rea&s;on our Canoas, which were &s;ent from <HI>Guatulco</HI> and ordered to tarry here for us, did not know it, (not thinking this to be that fine Harbour) and therefore went farther; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of them, as I &s;aid before, returned again, but the
<PB N="240" REF="262">
other 2 were not yet come to us. The Land that bounds this Harbour is pretty high, the Earth &s;andy and yellow, in &s;ome places red; it is partly Wood|land, partly Savannahs. The Trees in the Woods are large and tall, and the Savannahs are plenti|fully &s;tored with very kindly Gra&s;s. Two leagues to the Ea&s;t of this place is a Beef Farm, belonging to <HI>Don Diego de la Ro&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The 23 day we landed about 100 Men and march|ed thither, where we found plenty of of fat Bulls and Cows feeding in the Savannahs, and in the Hou&s;e good &s;tore of Salt and Maiz; and &s;ome Hogs, and Cocks and Hens: but the Owners or Over&s;eers were gone. We lay here 2 or 3 days fea&s;ting on fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, but could not contrive to carry any quan|tity aboard, becau&s;e the way was &s;o long, and our Men but weak, and a great wide River to ford. Therefore we returned again from thence the 26th day, and brought every one a little Beef or Pork for the Men that &s;tay'd aboard. The two nights that we &s;tay'd a&s;hoar at this place we heard great droves of Jaccals, as we &s;uppos'd them to be, bark|ing all night long, not far from us. None of us &s;aw the&s;e; but I do verily believe they were Jaccals; tho' I did never &s;ee tho&s;e Creatures in <HI>America,</HI> nor hear any but at this time. We could not think that there were le&s;s than 30 or 40 in a company. We got aboard in the Evening; but did not yet hear a|ny news of our two Canoas.</P>
<P>The 27th day in the morning we &s;ailed from hence, with the Land-wind at N. by W. The Sea|wind came about noon at W. S. W. and in the even|ing we anchored in 16 fathom Water, by a &s;mall rocky I&s;land, which lieth about half a mile from the Main, and 6 leagues We&s;tward from Port <HI>An|gels.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> give no account of this I&s;land in their Pilot-book. The 28th day we &s;ailed again with the Land-wind: In the afternoon the Sea|breez
<PB N="241" REF="263">
blew hard, and we &s;prung our Main Top-ma&s;t. This Coa&s;t is full of &s;mall Hills and Valleys, and a great Sea falls in upon the &s;hore. In the Night we met with the other two of our Canoas that went from us at <HI>Guatulco.</HI> They had been as far as <HI>Acapulco</HI> to &s;eek <HI>Port Angels.</HI> Coming back from thence they went into a River to get Water, and were encountered by 150 <HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet they filled their Water in &s;pight of them, but had one Man &s;hot thro' the Thigh. Afterward they went into a Lagune, or Lake of Salt-water, where they found much dried Fi&s;h, and brought &s;ome aboard. We being now a|bre&s;t of that place, &s;ent in a Canoa mann'd with 12 Men for more Fi&s;h. The mouth of this Lagune is not Pi&s;tol-&s;hot-wide, and on both &s;ides are pretty high Rocks, &s;o conveniently placed by Nature, that many Men may ab&s;cond behind; and within the Rock and Lagune opens wide on both &s;ides. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being alarmed by our two Canoas that had been there two or three days before, came armed to this Place to &s;ecure their Fi&s;h; and &s;eeing our Canoa coming, they lay &s;nug behind the Rocks, and &s;uf|fered the Canoa to pa&s;s in, then they fired their Volley, and wounded five of our Men. Our People were a little &s;urprized at this &s;udden Adventure, yet fired their Guns, and rowed farther into the Lagune, for they dur&s;t not adventure to come out again through the narrow Entrance, which was near a quarter of a Mile in length. Therefore they rowed into the middle of the Lagune, where they lay out of Gun-&s;hot, and looked about to &s;ee if there was not another Pa&s;&s;age to get out at, broader than that by which we entred, but could &s;ee none. So they lay &s;till two Days and three Nights, in hopes that we &s;hould come to &s;eek them; but we lay off at Sea, about three Leagues di&s;tant, waiting for their return, &s;uppo&s;ing by their long ab&s;ence, that they had made &s;ome greater Di&s;covery, and were
<PB N="242" REF="264">
gone farther than the Fi&s;h-Range; becau&s;e it is u&s;u|al with Privateers when they enter upon &s;uch de|&s;igns, to &s;earch farther than they propo&s;ed, if they meet any Encouragement. But Capt. <HI>Townley</HI> and his Bark being nearer the &s;hore, heard &s;ome Guns fired in the Lagune. So he mann'd his Canoa, and went towards the &s;hore, and beating the <HI>Spaniards</HI> away from the Rocks, made a free pa&s;&s;age for our Men to come out of their Pound, where el&s;e they mu&s;t have been &s;tarved or knocked on the head by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> They came aboard their Ships again the 31&s;t of <HI>Octob.</HI> This Lagune is about the lat. of 16 d. 40 m. North.</P>
<P>From hence we made &s;ail again, coa&s;ting to the We&s;tward, having fair Weather and a Current &s;et|ting to the We&s;t. The &s;econd day of <HI>November</HI> we pa&s;t by a Rock, called by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> the <HI>Alga|tro&s;s.</HI> The Land hereabout is of an indifferent height, and woody, and more within the Country Mountainous. Here are 7 or 8 white Cliffs by the Sea, which are very remarkable, becau&s;e there are none &s;o white and &s;o thick together on all the Coa&s;t. They are five or &s;ix Mile to the We&s;t of the <HI>Algatro&s;s</HI> Rock. There is a dangerous &s;hoal lieth S. by W. from the&s;e Cliffs, four or five Mile off at Sea. Two leagues to the We&s;t of the&s;e Cliffs there is a pretty large River, which forms a &s;mall I&s;land at its Mouth. The Channel on the Ea&s;t &s;ide is but &s;hoal and &s;andy, but the We&s;t Channel is deep enough for Canoas to enter. On the Banks of this Channel the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made a Bre&s;twork, to hinder an Enemy from landing, or filling Water.</P>
<P>The 3d day we Anchored abre&s;t of this River, in 14 fathom Water, about a Mile and a half off &s;hore. The next Morning we mann'd our Canoas, and went a&s;hore to the Bre&s;t-work with little re&s;i&s;tance, although there were about 200 Men to keep us off. They fired about 20 or 30 Guns at us, but &s;eeing
<PB N="243" REF="265">
we were re&s;olved to land, they quitted the place; one chief rea&s;on why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o frequently routed by us, although many times much our &s;u|periors in numbers, and in many places fortified with Bre&s;tworks, is, their want of &s;mall Fire-arms, for they have but few on all the Sea Coa&s;ts, unle&s;s near their larger Gari&s;ons. Here we found a great deal of Salt, brought hither, as I judge, for to &s;alt Fi&s;h, which they take in the Lagunes. The Fi&s;h I ob&s;erved here mo&s;tly, were what we call Snooks, neither a Sea-fi&s;h nor fre&s;h Water-fi&s;h, but very nu|merous in the&s;e &s;alt Lakes. This Fi&s;h is about a Foot long, and round, and as thick as the &s;mall of a Man's Leg, with a pretty long head: It hath Scales of a whiti&s;h colour, and is good meat. How the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take them I know not, for we never found any Nets, Hooks, or Lines, neither yet any Bark, Boat, or Canoa, among them, on all this Coa&s;t, except the Ship I &s;hall mention at <HI>Acapulco.</HI></P>
<P>We marched two or three Leagues into the Coun|try, and met with but one Hou&s;e, where we took a <HI>Mulatto</HI> Pri&s;oner, who informed us of a Ship that was lately arrived at <HI>Acapulco;</HI> &s;he came from <HI>Lima.</HI> Captain <HI>Townley</HI> wanting a good Ship, thought now he had an opportunity of getting one, if he could per&s;wade his Men to venture with him into the Harbour of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and fetch this <HI>Lima</HI> Ship out. Therefore he immediately propo&s;ed it, and found not only all his own Men willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but many of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Men al&s;o. Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> oppo&s;ed it, becau&s;e Provi&s;ion being &s;cares with us, he thought our time might be much bet|ter imployed in fir&s;t providing our &s;elves with rood; and here was plenty of Maiz in the River where we now were, as we were informed by the &s;ame Pri&s;oner, who offered to conduct us to the place where it was. But neither the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, nor
<PB N="244" REF="266">
Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s per&s;wa&s;ion availed any thing, no nor yet their own intere&s;t, for the great de&s;ign we had then in hand, was to lie and wait for a rich Ship which comes to <HI>Acapulco</HI> every Year richly la|den from the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands. But it was nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be well &s;tored with Provi&s;ions, to ena|ble us to Crui&s;e about, and wait the time of her co|ming. However, <HI>Townley</HI>'s Party prevailing, we only fill'd our Water here, and made ready to be gone. So the fifth Day in the Afternoon we &s;ailed again, Coa&s;ting to the We&s;tward, toward <HI>Acapulco.</HI> The 7th Day in the Afternoon, being about twelve Leagues from the &s;hoar, we &s;aw the high Land of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> which is very remarkable: for there is a round Hill &s;tanding between two other Hills; the We&s;termo&s;t of which is the bigge&s;t and highe&s;t, and hath two Hillocks like two Paps on its top: the Ea&s;termo&s;t Hill is higher and &s;harper than the mid|dlemo&s;t. From the middle Hill the Land declines toward the Sea, ending in a high round point. There is no Land &s;haped like this on all the Coa&s;t. In the evening Captain <HI>Townley</HI> went away from the Ships with 140 Men in 12 Canoas, to try to get the <HI>Lima</HI> Ship out of <HI>Acapulco</HI> Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>Acapulco</HI> is a pretty large Town, 17 degrees North of the Equator. It is the Sea-Port for the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Continent; as <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> or <HI>St. John d' Ulloa</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Nova Hi&s;pania,</HI> is on the North &s;ide. This Town is the only place of Trade on all this Coa&s;t; for there is little or no Traffick by Sea on all the N. W. part of this va&s;t Kingdom, here being, as I have &s;aid, neither Boats, Barks nor Ships, (that I could ever &s;ee) unle&s;s only what come hither from other parts, and &s;ome Boats near the S. E. end of <HI>California;</HI> as I gue&s;s, by the intercour&s;e between that and the Main, for Pearl-fi&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="267">
The Ships that Trade hither are only three, two that con&s;tantly go once a Year between this and <HI>Manila</HI> in <HI>Luconia,</HI> one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and one Ship more every Year to and from <HI>Lima.</HI> This from <HI>Lima</HI> commonly arrives a little before <HI>Chri&s;t|mas;</HI> &s;he brings them Quick-&s;ilver, Cacao, and Pieces of Eight. Here &s;he &s;tays till the <HI>Manila</HI> Ships arrive, and then takes in a Cargo of Spices, Silks, Callicoes, and Mu&s;lins, and other <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities, for the u&s;e of <HI>Peru,</HI> and then re|turns to <HI>Lima.</HI> This is but a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of 20 Guns, but the two <HI>Manila</HI> Ships are each &s;aid to be above 1000 Tun. The&s;e make their Voyages alternately, &s;o that one or other of them is always at the <HI>Manila</HI>'s. When either of them &s;ets out from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> it is at the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>April;</HI> &s;he always touches to re|fre&s;h at <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, in about 60 Days &s;pace after &s;he &s;ets out. There &s;he &s;tays but two or three Days, and then pro&s;ecutes her Voyage to <HI>Manila,</HI> where &s;he commonly arrives &s;ome time in <HI>June.</HI> By that time the other is ready to &s;ail from thence, laden with <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities. She &s;tretcheth away to the North as far as 36, or &s;ometimes into 40 degrees of North lat. before &s;he gets a Wind to &s;tand over to the <HI>American</HI> &s;hoar. She falls in fir&s;t with the Coa&s;t of <HI>California,</HI> and then Coa&s;ts along the &s;hoar to the South again, and never mi&s;&s;es a Wind to bring her away from thence quite to <HI>Acapulco.</HI> When &s;he gets the length of Cape <HI>St. Lucas,</HI> which is the Southermo&s;t point of <HI>California,</HI> &s;he &s;tretcheth over to Cape <HI>Corientes,</HI> which is in about the 20th degree of North lat. from thence &s;he Coa&s;ts along till &s;he comes to <HI>Sal|lagua,</HI> and there &s;he &s;ets a&s;hoar Pa&s;&s;engers that are bound to the City of <HI>Mexico:</HI> From thence &s;he makes her be&s;t way, Coa&s;ting &s;till along &s;hoar, till &s;he arrives at <HI>Acapulco,</HI> which is commonly about
<PB N="246" REF="268">
<HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> never more than 8 or 10 days before or after. Upon the return of this Ship to the <HI>Manila,</HI> the other which &s;tayeth there till her arrival, takes her turn back to <HI>Acapulco.</HI> Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> there|fore was impo&s;ed on by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who told him that there were 8 Sail, or more, that u&s;ed this Trade.</P>
<P>The Port of <HI>Acapulco</HI> is very commodious for the reception of Ships, and &s;o large, that &s;ome hundreds may &s;afely Ride there without damnify|ing each other. There is a &s;mall low I&s;land cro&s;|&s;ing the mouth of the Harbour; it is about a Mile and a half long, and half a Mile broad, &s;tretching Ea&s;t and We&s;t. It leaves a good wide deep Chan|nel at each end, where Ships may &s;afely go in or come out, taking the advantage of the Winds; they mu&s;t enter with the Sea-Wind, and go out with the Land-Wind, for the&s;e Winds &s;eldom or never fail to &s;ucceed each other alternately in their proper &s;ea&s;on of the Day or Night. The We&s;termo&s;t Channel is the narrowe&s;t, but &s;o deep, there is no Anchoring, and the <HI>Manila</HI> Ships pa&s;s in that way, but the Ships from <HI>Lima</HI> enter on the S. W. Chan|nel. This Harbour runs in North about 3 Miles, then growing very narrow, it turns &s;hort about to the We&s;t, and runs about a Mile farther, where it ends. The Town &s;tands on the N. W. &s;ide; at the mouth of this narrow pa&s;&s;age, clo&s;e by the Sea, and at the end of the Town, there is a Platform with a great many Guns. Oppo&s;ite to the Town, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, &s;tands a high &s;trong Ca&s;tle, &s;aid to have 40 Guns of a very great bore. Ships com|monly Ride near the bottom of the Harbour, under the Command both of the Ca&s;tle and the Plat|form.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Townly,</HI> who, as I &s;aid before, with 140 Men, left our Ships on a de&s;ign to fetch the <HI>Lima</HI> Ship out of the Harbour, had not Rowed above 3 or 4 Leagues before the Voyage was like to end
<PB N="247" REF="269">
with all their Lives; for on a &s;udden they were en|countred with a violent Tornado from the &s;hore, which had like to have foundered all the Canoas: but they e&s;caped that danger, and the &s;econd night got &s;afe into <HI>Port Marquis. Port Marquis</HI> is a very good Harbour, a League to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Acapulco</HI> Har|bour. Here they &s;taid all the next Day to dry them|&s;elves, their Cloaths, their Arms, and Ammunition, and the next Night they rowed &s;oftly into <HI>Acapulco</HI> Harbour; and becau&s;e they would not be heard, they hal'd in their Oars, and paddled as &s;oftly as if they had been &s;eeking Manatee. They paddled clo&s;e to the Ca&s;tle; then &s;truck over to the Town, and found the Ship riding between the Bre&s;t-work and the Fort, within about 100 Yards of each. When they had well viewed her, and con&s;idered the danger of the de&s;ign, they thought it not po&s;&s;i|ble to accompli&s;h it; therefore they paddled &s;oftly back again, till they were out of command of the Forts, and then they went to Land, and fell in a|mong a Company of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers (for the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> having &s;een them the day before, had &s;et Guards along the Coa&s;t) who immediately fired at them, but did them no damage, only made them retire farther from the &s;hore. They lay afterwards at the mouth of the Harbour till it was day, to take a view of the Town and Ca&s;tle, and then returned aboard again, being tired, hungry, and &s;orry for their Di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>The 11th day we made &s;ail again further on to the We&s;tward, with the Land wind, which is com|monly at N. E. but the Sea winds are at S. W. We pa&s;&s;ed by a long &s;andy Bay of above 20 Leagues. All the way along it the Sea falls with &s;uch force on the &s;hore, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to come near it with Boat or Canoa; yet it is good clean ground, and good an|choring a Mile or two from the &s;hore. The Land by the Sea is low, and indifferent Fertile, produ|cing
<PB N="248" REF="270">
many &s;orts of Trees, e&s;pecially the &s;preading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which grows in &s;pots from one end of the Bay to the other.</P>
<P>The P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> tree is as big as an ordinary A&s;h, growing about 20 or 30 Foot high. The Body is clear from Boughs or Branches, till ju&s;t at the head; there it &s;preads forth many large green Branches, not much unlike the Cabbage tree before de&s;cribed. The&s;e Branches al&s;o grow in many Places, (as in <HI>Jamaica, Darien,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> &amp;c.) from a &s;tump not above a Foot or two high; which is not the Remains of a Tree cut down; for none of the&s;e &s;ort of Trees will ever grow again when they have once lo&s;t their Head; but the&s;e are a &s;ort of Dwarf-palm, and the Branches which grow from the &s;tump, are not &s;o large as tho&s;e that grow on the great Tree. The&s;e &s;maller Branches are u&s;ed both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> for thatching Hou&s;es: They are very la&s;ting and &s;erviceable, much &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the Palmeto. For this Thatch, if well laid on, will endure five or &s;ix Years; and this is called by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> the <HI>Palmeto Royal.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Jamaica</HI> give it the &s;ame Name. Whether this be the &s;ame which they in <HI>Guinea</HI> get the Palm wine from, I know not; but I know that it is like this.</P>
<P>The Land in the Country is full of &s;mall pecked barren Hills, making as many little Valleys, which appear flouri&s;hing and green. At the We&s;t-end of this Bay is the Hill of <HI>Petaplan,</HI> in lat. 17 d. 30 m. N. This is a round Point &s;tretching out into the Sea: At a di&s;tance it &s;eems to be an I&s;land. A little to the We&s;t of this Hill are &s;everal round Rocks, which we left without us, &s;teering in between them and the round Point, where we had 11 fa|thom Water. We came to an Anchor on the N. W. &s;ide of the Hill, and went a&s;hore, about 170 Men of us, and marched into the Country 12 or 14
<PB N="249" REF="271">
Miles. There we came to a poor <HI>Indian</HI> Village that did not afford us a Meal of Victuals. The Peo|ple all fled, only a <HI>Mulatto</HI> Woman, and three or four &s;mall Children, who were taken and brought a|board. She told us that a Carrier (one who drives a Caravan of Mules) was goin to <HI>Acapulco,</HI> laden with Flower and other Goods, but &s;topt in the Road for fear of us, a little to the We&s;t of this Village, (for he had heard of our being on this Coa&s;t) and &s;he thought he &s;till remained there: And therefore it was we kept the Woman to be our Guide to car|ry us to that place. At this place where we now lay our <HI>Moskito-men</HI> &s;truck &s;ome &s;mall Turtle, and many &s;mall <HI>Jew-fi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jew-fi&s;h</HI> is a very good Fi&s;h, and I judge &s;o called by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e it hath Scales and Fins, therefore a clean Fi&s;h, according to the <HI>Levitical Law,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Jamaica</HI> buy them, and eat them very freely. It is a very large Fi&s;h, &s;haped much like a Cod, but a great deal bigger; one will weigh 3, or 4, or 5 hundred weight. It hath a large Head, with great Fins and Scales, as big as an Half-Crown, an&s;werable to the bigne&s;s of his Body. It is very &s;weet Meat, and commonly fat. This Fi&s;h lives among Rocks; there are plenty of them in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> about <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos;</HI> but chiefly in the&s;e Seas, e&s;pecially more We&s;tward.</P>
<P>We went from hence with our Ships the 18th day, and &s;teered We&s;t about two Leagues farther, to a place called <HI>Chequetan.</HI> A Mile and half from the &s;hore there is a &s;mall Key, and within it is a very good Harbour where Ships may careen; there is al&s;o a &s;mall River of fre&s;h Water, and Wood enough.</P>
<P>The 14th Day in the Morning we went with 95 Men in &s;ix Canoas to &s;eek for the Carrier, taking the <HI>Mulatto-Woman</HI> for our Guide; but Captain <HI>Townley</HI> would not go with us. Before day we lan|ded
<PB N="250" REF="272">
at a place called <HI>E&s;tapa,</HI> a League to the We&s;t of <HI>Chequeton.</HI> The Woman was well acquainted here, having been often at this place for Mu&s;cles, as &s;he told us; for here are great plenty of them. They &s;eem in all re&s;pects like our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mu&s;cles. She carry'd us through the pathle&s;s Wood by the &s;ide of a River, for about a League: Then we came into a Savannah full of Bulls and Cows; and here the Carrier before-mentioned was lying at the E&s;tan|tion-hou&s;e with his Mules, not having dared to advance all this while, as not knowing where we lay; &s;o his own fear made him, his Mules, and all his Goods, become a Prey to us. He had 40 Packs of Flower, &s;ome Chocolate, a great many &s;mall Chee&s;es, and abundance of Earthen Ware. The Eatables we brought away, but the Earthen Ve&s;&s;els we had no occa&s;ion for, and therefore left them. The Mules were about 60: We brought our Prize with them to the Shore, and &s;o turned them away. Here we al&s;o kill'd &s;ome Cows, and brought with us to our Canoas. In the Afternoon our Ships came to an Anchor half a Mile from the place where we landed, and then we went aboard. Captain <HI>Townley</HI> &s;eeing our good &s;ucce&s;s, went a&s;hore with his Men to kill &s;ome Cows; for here were no Inhabitants near to oppo&s;e us. The Land is very woody, of a good fertile Soil, watered with many &s;mall Rivers; yet it hath but few Inhabitants near the Sea. Capt. <HI>Townley</HI> kill'd 18 Beefs, and after he came aboard, our Men, contrary to Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s inclination, gave Capt. <HI>Townley</HI> part of the Flower which we took a&s;hore. Afterwards we gave the Woman &s;ome Cloaths for her, and her Children, and put her and two of them a&s;hore; but one of them, a very pretty Boy, about 7 or 8 Years old Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> kept. The Woman cried, and begg'd hard to have him; but Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> would not, but promi&s;ed to make much of him, and was as
<PB N="251" REF="273">
good as his word. He proved afterwards a very fine Boy for Wit, Courage, and Dexterity; I have often wonder'd at his Expre&s;&s;ions and Actions.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day in the evening, we &s;ailed hence with the Land-Wind. The Land-Winds on this part of the Coa&s;t are at N. and the Sea-Winds at W. S. W. We had fair Weather, and Coa&s;ted along to the We&s;tward. The Land is high, and full of ragged Hills; and We&s;t from the&s;e ragged Hills, the Land makes many plea&s;ant and fruitful Valleys among the Mountains. The 25th day we were abre&s;t of a very remarkable Hill, which towring above the re&s;t of its fellows, is divided in the top, and makes two &s;mall parts. It is in lat. 18 d. 8 m. North. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> make mention of a Town called <HI>Thelupan</HI> near this Hill, which we would have vi&s;ited if we could have found the way to it. The 26th day Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and Capt. <HI>Townley,</HI> with 200 Men, of whom I was one, went in our Canoas to &s;eek for the City of <HI>Colima,</HI> a rich Place by report, but how far within Land I could never learn: for, as I &s;aid before, here is no Trade by Sea, and therefore we could never get Guides to inform us, or conduct us to any Town, but one or two, on this Coa&s;t, and there is never a Town that lieth open to the Sea but <HI>Acapulco;</HI> and therefore our &s;earch was commonly fruitle&s;s, as now; for, we rowed above 20 Leagues along &s;hoar, and found it a very bad Coa&s;t to Land. We &s;aw no Hou&s;e, nor &s;ign of In|habitants, although we pa&s;t by a fine Valley, called the Valley of <HI>Maguella;</HI> only at two places, the one at our fir&s;t &s;etting out on this Expedition, and the other at the end of it, we &s;aw a Hor&s;eman &s;et, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, as a Centinel, to watch us. At both places we landed with difficulty, and at each place we followed the track of the Hor&s;e on the &s;andy Bay; but where they entred the Woods we lo&s;t the track, and although we diligently &s;earcht
<PB N="252" REF="274">
for it, yet we could find it no more; &s;o we were perfectly at a lo&s;s to find out the Hou&s;es or Town they came from. The 28th Day, being tired and hopele&s;s to find any Town, we went aboard our Ships, that were now come abre&s;t of the place where we were; for always when we leave our Ships, we either order a certain place of meeting, or el&s;e leave them a &s;ign to know where we are, by making one or more great Smoaks: yet we had all like to have been ruin'd by &s;uch a &s;ignal as this, in a former Voyage under Captain <HI>Sharp,</HI> when we made that unfortunate Attempt upon <HI>Arica,</HI> which is mentioned in the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Buccaneers.</HI> For upon the routing our Men, and taking &s;everal of them, &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;o taken told the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that it was agreed between them and their Com|panions on board, to make two great Smoaks at a di&s;tance from each other, as &s;oon as the Town &s;hould be taken, as a &s;ignal to the Ship, that it might &s;afely enter the Harbour. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made the&s;e Smoaks pre&s;ently: I was then among tho&s;e who &s;taid on board; and whether the &s;ignal was not &s;o exactly made, or &s;ome other di&s;courage|ment happen'd, I remember not, but we forbore going in, till we &s;aw our &s;catter'd Crew coming off in their Canoas. Had we enter'd the Port upon the fal&s;e &s;ignal, we mu&s;t have been taken or &s;unk; for we mu&s;t have pa&s;t clo&s;e by the Fort, and could have had no Wind to bring us out, till the Land-Wind &s;hould ri&s;e in the Night.</P>
<P>But to our pre&s;ent Voyage: After we came a|board we &s;aw the Volcan of <HI>Colima.</HI> This is a very high Mountain, in about 18 d. 36 m. North, &s;tanding 5 or 6 Leagues from the Sea, in the mid&s;t of a plea&s;ant Valley. It appears with two &s;harp peeks, from each of which there do always i&s;&s;ue flames of fire or &s;moak. The Valley in which this Volcan &s;tands, is callel the Valley of <HI>Colima,</HI> from the Town
<PB N="253" REF="275">
it &s;elf which &s;tands there not far from the Volcan. The Town is &s;aid to be great and rich, the chief of all its Neighbourhood: and the Valley in which it is &s;eated, by the relation which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give of it, is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fruitful Valley in all the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico.</HI> This Valley is about ten or twelve Leagues wide by the Sea, where it makes a &s;mall Bay: but how far the Vale runs into the Country I know not. It is &s;aid to be full of Cacoa|gardens, Fields of Corn, Wheat, and Plantain-Walks. The neighbouring Sea is bounded with a &s;andy &s;hoar; but there is no going a&s;hoar for the violence of the Waves. The Land within it is low all along, and Woody for about two Leagues from the Ea&s;t &s;ide; at the end of the Woods there is a deep River runs out into the Sea, but it hath &s;uch a great Bar, or &s;andy Shoal, that when we were here, no Boat or Canoa could po&s;&s;ibly enter, the Sea running &s;o high upon the Bar: otherwi&s;e, I judge, we &s;hould have made &s;ome farther di&s;cove|ry into this plea&s;ant Valley. On the We&s;t &s;ide of the River the Savannah land begins, and runs to the other &s;ide of the Valley. We had but little Wind when we came aboard, therefore we lay off this Bay that Afternoon and the Night en&s;uing.</P>
<P>The 29th Day our Captains went away from our Ships with 200 Men, intending at the fir&s;t conve|nient place to land and &s;earch about for a Path: for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Books make mention of 2 or 3 other Towns hereabouts, e&s;pecially one called <HI>Sallagua,</HI> to the We&s;t of this Bay. Our Canoas rowed along as near the &s;hoar as they could, but the Sea went &s;o high that they could not land. About 10 or 11 a Clock, two Hor&s;emen came near the &s;hoar, and one of them took a Bottle out of his Pocket, and drank to our Men. While he was drinking, one of our Men &s;natch'd up his Gun, and let drive at him, and kill'd his Hor&s;e: &s;o his Con&s;ort immediately &s;et Spurs to
<PB N="254" REF="276">
his Hor&s;e and rode away, leaving the other to come after afoot. But he being Booted, made but &s;low ha&s;te; therefore two of our Men &s;tript them|&s;elves, and &s;wam a&s;hoar to take him. But he had a Macheat, or long Knife, wherewith he kept them both from &s;eizing him, they having nothing in their Hands wherewith to defend them&s;elves, or offend him. The 30th day our Men came all a|board again, for they could not find any place to land in.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of <HI>December</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by the Port of <HI>Sallagua.</HI> This Port is in lat. 18 d. 52 m. It is only a pretty deep Bay, divided in the middle with a rocky point, which makes, as it were, two Har|bours. Ships may ride &s;ecurely in either, but the We&s;t Harbour is the be&s;t: there is good Anchoring any where in 10 or 12 fathom, and a Brook of fre&s;h Water runs into the Sea. Here we &s;aw a great new thatched Hou&s;e, and a great many <HI>Spaniards</HI> both Hor&s;e and Foot, with Drums beating, and Co|lours flying, in defiance of us, as we thought. We took no notice of them till the next Morning, and then we landed about 200 Men to try their Cou|rage; but they pre&s;ently withdrew. The Foot ne|ver &s;tay'd to exchange one &s;hot, but the Hor&s;emen &s;tay'd till two or three were knock'd down, and then they drew off, our Men pur&s;uing them. At la&s;t, two of our Men took two Hor&s;es that had lo&s;t their Ri|ders, and mounting them, rode after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> full drive till they came among them, thinking to have taken a Pri&s;oner for Intelligence, but had like to have been taken them&s;elves: for four <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ur|rounded them, after they had di&s;charged their Pi|&s;tols, and unhor&s;ed them; and if &s;ome of our be&s;t Footmen had not come to their re&s;cue, they mu&s;t have yielded, or have been killed. They were both cut in two or three places, but their Wounds were not Mortal. The four <HI>Spaniards</HI> got away before our Men
<PB N="255" REF="277">
could hurt them, and mounting their Hor&s;es, &s;peed|ed after their Con&s;orts, who were marched away into the Country. Our Men finding a broad Road leading into the Country, followed it about four Leagues in a dry &s;tony Country, full of &s;hort Wood; but finding no &s;ign of Inhabitants, they returned again. In their way back they took two <HI>Mullatto</HI>'s, who were not able to march as fa&s;t as their Con&s;orts; therefore they had skulked in the Woods, and by that means thought to have e&s;caped our Men. The&s;e Pri&s;oners informed us, that this great Road did lead to a great City called <HI>Oarrha,</HI> from whence many of tho&s;e Hor&s;emen before &s;poken of came: That this City was di&s;tant from hence as far as a Hor&s;e will go in four Days; and that there is no place of con&s;equence nearer: That the Country is very poor, and thinly inhabited. They &s;aid al&s;o, that the&s;e Men came to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ship, that was every day expected here, to put a&s;hore Pa&s;&s;en|gers for <HI>Mexico.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pilot-Books, mention a Town al&s;o called <HI>Sallogua</HI> hereabouts; but we could not find it, nor hear any thing of it by our Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>We now intended to crui&s;e off the Cape <HI>Corrien|tes,</HI> to wait for the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ship. So the 6th Day of <HI>Decemb.</HI> we &s;et &s;ail, coa&s;ting to the We&s;twards towards Cape <HI>Corrientes.</HI> We had fair Weather, and but little Wind; the Sea-Breezes at N. W. and the Land Wind at N. The Land is of an indifferent heighth, full of ragged Points, which at a di&s;tance appear like I&s;lands: The Country is very woody, but the Trees are not high, nor very big.</P>
<P>Here I was taken &s;ick of a Fever and Ague that afterwards turned to a Drop&s;ie, which I laboured under a long time after; and many of our Men died of this Di&s;temper, though our Surgeons u&s;ed their greate&s;t skill to pre&s;erve their Lives. The Drop&s;ie is a general Di&s;temper on this Coa&s;t, and the Natives
<PB N="256" REF="278">
&s;ay, that the be&s;t remedy they can find for it, is the Stone or Cod of an Allegator (of which they have 4, one near each Leg, within the Fle&s;h) pulverized and drunk in Water: This Receipt we al&s;o found menti|oned in an Almanack made at <HI>Mexico:</HI> I would have tried it, but we found no Allegators here, tho' there are &s;everal.</P>
<P>There are many good Harbours between <HI>Salla|gua</HI> and Cape <HI>Corrientes:</HI> but we pa&s;&s;ed by them all. As we drew near the Cape, the Land by the Sea appeared of an indifferent heighth, full of white Cliffs; but in the Country the Land is high and barren, and full of &s;harp pecked Hills, unplea&s;ant to the &s;ight. To the We&s;t of this ragged Land is a Chain of Mountains running parallel with the Shore; They end on the We&s;t with a gentle de&s;cent; but on the Ea&s;t &s;ide they keep their heighth, ending with a high &s;teep Mountain, which hath three &s;mall &s;harp pecked tops, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a Crown; and therefore called by the <HI>Spaniards, Coronada,</HI> the <HI>Crown Land.</HI></P>
<P>The 11th day we were fair in &s;ight of Cape <HI>Cor|rientes,</HI> it bore N. by W. and the <HI>Crown Land</HI> bore North. The Cape is of an indifferent heighth, with &s;teep Rocks to the Sea. It is flat and even on the top, cloathed with Woods: The Land in the Coun|try is high and doubled. This Cape lieth in 20 d. 28 m. North. I find its longitude from <HI>Tenariff</HI> to be 230 d. 56 m. but I keep my longitude We&s;tward, according to our Cour&s;e; and according to this reckoning, I find it is from the <HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>England</HI> 121 d. 41 m. &s;o that the difference of time is eight Hours, and almo&s;t &s;ix Minutes.</P>
<P>Here we had re&s;olved to cruize for the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ship, becau&s;e &s;he always makes this Cape in her Voyage homeward. We were (as I have &s;aid) four Ships in Company; Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and his Ten|der; Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> and his Tender. It was &s;o
<PB N="257" REF="279">
ordered that Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;hould lye Eight or Ten Leagues off &s;hore, and the re&s;t about a League di|&s;tant each from other, between him and the Cape, that &s;o we might not mi&s;s the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ship; but we wanted Provi&s;ion, and therefore we &s;ent Capt. <HI>Townley</HI>'s Bark, with 50 or 60 Men to the We&s;t of the Cape, to &s;earch about for &s;ome Town or Planta|tions, where we might get Provi&s;ion of any &s;ort. The re&s;t of us in the mean time crui&s;ing in our Stations. The 17th Day the Bark came to us again, but had got nothing, for they could not get about the Cape, becau&s;e the Wind on this Coa&s;t is commonly be|tween the N. W. and the S. W. which makes it very difficult getting to the We&s;tward; but they left four Canoas with 46 Men at the Cape, who re&s;ol|ved to row to the We&s;tward. The 18th Day we &s;ailed to the Keys of <HI>Chametly</HI> to fill our Water. The&s;e Keys or I&s;lands of <HI>Chametly</HI> are about 16 or 18 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of Cape <HI>Corrientes.</HI> They are &s;mall, low, and woody, invironed with Rocks; there are five of them lying in the form of an half Moon, not a Mile from the &s;hore, and be|tween them and the Main is very good Riding, &s;e|cure from any Wind. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> do report, that here live Fi&s;hermen, to fi&s;h for the Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Purification.</HI> This is &s;aid to be a large Town, the be&s;t hereabouts; but is 14 Leagues up in the Country.</P>
<P>The 20th in&s;tant we entred within the&s;e I&s;lands, pa&s;&s;ing in on the S. E. &s;ide, and Anchored between the I&s;lands and the Main, in five fathom clean Sand. Here we found good fre&s;h water and wood, and caught plenty of Rock-fi&s;h with Hook and Line, a &s;ort of Fi&s;h I de&s;cribed at the I&s;le of <HI>John Fernando,</HI> but we &s;aw no &s;ign of Inhabitants, be&s;ides three or four old Hutts; therefore I do believe that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Fi&s;hermen come hither only at <HI>Lent,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;uch Sea&s;on, but that they do not live
<PB N="258" REF="280">
here con&s;tantly. The 21&s;t Day Captain <HI>Townley</HI> went away, with about 60 Men, to take an <HI>Indian</HI> Village, 7 or 8 Leagues from hence to the We&s;tward more towards the Cape, and the next Day we went to crui&s;e off the Cape, where Captain <HI>Townley</HI> was to meet us. The 24th Day, as we were crui&s;ing off the Cape, the four Canoas before-mentioned, which Captain <HI>Townley</HI>'s Bark left at the Cape, came off to us. They, after the Bark left them, pa&s;t to the VVe&s;t of the Cape, and rowed into the Valley <HI>Valderas,</HI> or perhaps <HI>Val d' Iris;</HI> for it &s;igni|fies the <HI>Valley of Flags.</HI></P>
<P>This Valley lies in the bottom of a pretty deep Bay, that runs in between Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> on the S. E. and the point of <HI>Pontique</HI> on the N. VV. which two places are about 10 Leagues a&s;under. The Valley is about 3 Leagues wide; there is a level &s;andy Bay again&s;t the Sea, and good &s;mooth land|ing. In the mid&s;t of the Bay is a fine River, where|into Boats may enter; but it is bracki&s;h at the latter end of the dry Sea&s;on, which is in <HI>February, March,</HI> and part of <HI>April.</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak more of the Sea&s;ons in my Chapter of VVinds, in the Ap|pendix. This Valley is bounded within Land, with a &s;mall green Hill, that makes a very gentle de|&s;cent into the Valley, and affords a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect to Sea-ward. It is inriched with fruitful Savannahs, mixt with Groves of Trees fit for any u&s;es, be&s;ides Fruit-Trees in abundance, as Guava's, Oranges and Limes, which here grow wild in &s;uch plenty, as if Nature had de&s;igned it only for a Garden. The Savannahs are full of fat Bulls and Cows, and &s;ome Hor&s;es, but no Hou&s;e in &s;ight.</P>
<P>VVhen our Canoas came to this plea&s;ant Valley, they landed 37 Men, and marched into the Coun|try &s;eeking for &s;ome Hou&s;es. They had not gone pa&s;t three Mile before they were attackt by 150 <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot: There was a &s;mall thin
<PB N="259" REF="281">
VVood clo&s;e by them, into which our Men retreat|ed, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the fury of the Hor&s;e: Yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> rode in among them, and attackt them very furiou&s;ly, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, and 17 more, tumbled dead off their Hor&s;es: then the re&s;t retreated, being many of them wounded. VVe lo&s;t four Men, and had two de&s;perately wounded. In this action, the Foot, who were armed with Lances and Swords, and were the greate&s;t number, never made any attack; the Hor&s;emen had each a brace of Pi&s;tols, and &s;ome &s;hort Guns. If the Foot had come in, they had certainly de&s;troy'd all our Men. VVhen the Skirmi&s;h was over, our Men placed the two wounded Men on Hor&s;es, and came to their Canoas. There they kill'd one of the Hor&s;es, and dre&s;s'd it, being afraid to venture into the Savannah to kill a Bullock, of which there was &s;tore. VVhen they had eaten, and &s;atisfied them&s;elves, they re|turned aboard. The 25th Day, being <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> we crui&s;ed in pretty near the Cape, and &s;ent in 3 Canoas with the Strikers to get Fi&s;h, being de&s;i|rous to have a <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Dinner. In the Afternoon they returned aboard with three great <HI>Jew fi&s;h,</HI> which fea&s;ted us all, and the next Day we &s;ent a|&s;hoar our Canoas again, and got three or four more.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Townley,</HI> who went from us at <HI>Chametly,</HI> came aboard the 28th Day, and brought about 40 Bu&s;hels of Maiz. He had landed to the Ea&s;tward of Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> and march'd to an <HI>Indian</HI> Village that is 4 or 5 Leagues in the Country. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eeing him coming, &s;et two Hou&s;es on fire that were full of Maiz, and run away; yet he and his Men got in other Hou&s;es as much as they could bring down on their backs, which he brought aboard.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="year"> We crui&s;ed off the Cape till the fir&s;t Day of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> 1686. and then made towards the Valley <HI>Valderas,</HI> to hunt for Beef, and before Night we Anchored in the bottom of the Bay, in 60 fathom
<PB N="260" REF="282">
Water a Mile from the Shoar. Here we &s;tay'd hunting till the 7th Day, and Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and Captain <HI>Townley</HI> went a&s;hoar every Morning with about 240 Men, and marched to a &s;mall Hill; where they remained with 50 or 60 Men to watch the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who appeared in great companies on other Hills not far di&s;tant, but did never attempt any thing again&s;t our Men. Here we killed and &s;alt|ed above two Months Meat, be&s;ides what we &s;pent fre&s;h; and might have killed as much more, if we had been better &s;tored with Salt. Our hopes of meeting the <HI>Philippine</HI> Ship were now over; for we did all conclude, that while we were nece&s;&s;itated to hunt here for Provi&s;ions, &s;he was pa&s;t by to the Ea&s;tward, as indeed &s;he was, as we did under&s;tand afterwards by Pri&s;oners. So this de&s;ign fail'd, through Captain <HI>Townley</HI>'s eagerne&s;s after the <HI>Lima</HI> Ship, which he attempted in <HI>Acapulco</HI> Harbour, as I have related. For though we took a little Flow|er hard by, yet the &s;ame Guide which told us of that Ship, would have conducted us where we might have had &s;tore of Beef and Maiz: but in&s;tead there|of, we lo&s;t both our time, and the opportunity of providing our &s;elves; and &s;o we were forced to be victualling, when we &s;hould have been crui&s;ing off Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> in expectation of the <HI>Manila</HI> Ship.</P>
<P>Hitherto we had coa&s;ted along here with two dif|ferent de&s;igns; the one was to get the <HI>Manila</HI> Ship, which would have inriched us beyond mea&s;ure; and this Captain <HI>Townley</HI> was mo&s;t for. Sir <HI>Tho. Cavendi&s;h</HI> formerly took the <HI>Manila</HI> Ship off Cape <HI>St. Lucas</HI> in <HI>California,</HI> (where we al&s;o would have waited for her, had we been early enough &s;tored with Provi&s;ions, to have met her there) and threw much rich Goods over-board. The other de&s;ign, which Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and our Crew were mo&s;t for, was to &s;earch along the Coa&s;t for rich Towns, and Mines chiefly of Gold and Silver, which we were
<PB N="261" REF="283">
a&s;&s;ured were in this Country, and we hoped near the &s;hoar: not knowing (as we afterwards found) that it was in effect an Inland Country, its Wealth remote from the <HI>South Sea</HI> Coa&s;t, and having little or no commerce with it, its Trade being driven Ea&s;tward with <HI>Europe</HI> by <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI> Yet we had &s;till &s;ome expectation of Mines, and &s;o re&s;olved to Steer on farther Northward; but Captain <HI>Town|ley,</HI> who had no other de&s;ign in coming on this Coa&s;t, but to meet this Ship, re&s;olved to return again towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>In all this Voyage on the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t, we had with us a Captain, and two or three of his Men, of our friendly <HI>Indians</HI> of the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien;</HI> who having conducted over &s;ome parties of our Privateers, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to go along with us, were received, and kindly entertained aboard our Ships; and we were pleas'd in having, by this means, Guides ready provided, &s;hould we be for returning over Land, as &s;everal of us thought to do, rather than &s;ail round about. But at this time, we of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Ship de&s;igning farther to the North-We&s;t; and Captain <HI>Townley</HI> going back, we com|mitted the&s;e our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends to his care, to carry them home. So here we parted; he to the Ea&s;t|ward, and we to the We&s;tward, intending to &s;earch as far to the We&s;tward as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;ettled.</P>
<P>It was the 7th Day of <HI>January</HI> in the Morning when we &s;ailed from this plea&s;ant Valley. The Wind was at N. E. and the weather fair. At 11 a Clock the Sea-wind came at N. W. Before Night we pa&s;&s;ed by Point <HI>Pontique;</HI> this is the We&s;t point of the Bay of the Valley of <HI>Valderas,</HI> and is di&s;tant from Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> 10 Leagues. This point is in lat. 20 d. 50 m. North; it is high, round, rocky and barren. At a di&s;tance it appears like an I&s;land. A league to the We&s;t of this point are two &s;mall bar|ren
<PB N="262" REF="284">
I&s;lands, called the I&s;lands of <HI>Pontique.</HI> There are &s;everal high, &s;harp, white Rocks, that lie &s;cat|tering about them: We pa&s;s'd between the&s;e rocky I&s;lands on the left, and the Main on the right, for there is no danger. The Sea-coa&s;t beyond this point runs Northward for about 18 Leagues, making ma|ny ragged points, with &s;mall &s;andy Bays between them. The Land by the Sea-&s;ide is low and pretty woody; but in the Country, full of high, &s;harp, barren, rugged, unplea&s;ant Hills.</P>
<P>The 14th Day we had &s;ight of a &s;mall white Rock, which appears very much like a Ship under &s;ail. This Rock is in lat. 21 d. 15 m. it is 3 Leagues from the Main. There is a good Channel between it and the Main, where you will have 12 or 14 fathom Water near the I&s;land; but running nearer the Main, you will have gradual &s;oundings, till you come in with the &s;hoar. At Night we Anchored in &s;ix fathom Water, near a League from the Main, in good ouzy ground. We caught a great many <HI>Cat|fi&s;h</HI> here, and at &s;everal places on this Coa&s;t, both before and after this.</P>
<P>From this I&s;land the Land runs more Northerly, making a fair &s;andy Bay; but the Sea falls in with &s;uch violence on the &s;hoar, that there is no land|ing, but very good Anchoring on all the Coa&s;t, and gradual Soundings. About a League off &s;hoar, you will havo 6 fathom, and 4 Mile off &s;hoar you will have 7 fathom Water. We came to an Anchor every Evening; and in the Mornings we &s;ailed off with the Land-wind, which we found at N. E. and the Sea-breezes at N. W.</P>
<P>The 20th Day we Anchored about three Miles on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;lands <HI>Chametly,</HI> different from tho&s;e of that name before-mentioned; for the&s;e are &s;ix &s;mall I&s;lands, in lat. 23 d. 11 m. a little to the South of the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and about 3 Leagues from the Main, where a Salt Lake hath its out-let
<PB N="263" REF="285">
into the Sea. The&s;e I&s;les are of an indifferent heighth: Some of them have a few &s;hrubby bu&s;hes; the re&s;t are bare of any &s;ort of Wood. They are rocky round by the Sea; only one or two of them have &s;andy Bays on the North &s;ide. There is a &s;ort of Fruit growing on the&s;e I&s;lands called Penguins; and 'tis all the Fruit they have.</P>
<P>The Penguin Fruit is of two &s;orts, the yellow and the red. The yellow Penguin grows on a green Stem, as big as a Man's Arm, above a Foot high from the ground: The Leaves of this Stalk are half a Foot long, and an Inch broad; the edges full of &s;harp prickles. The Fruit grows at the Head of the Stalk, in 2 or 3 great clu&s;ters, 16 or 20 in a clu&s;ter. The Fruit is as big as a Pullets Egg, of a round form, and in colour yellow. It has a thick Skin or Rind, and the in&s;ide is full of &s;mall black Seeds, mixt among the Fruit. It is &s;harp plea&s;ant Fruit. The red Penguin is of the bigne&s;s and colour of a &s;mall dry Onion, and is in &s;hape much like a Nine-pin; for it grows not on a Stalk, or Stem, as the other, but one end on the ground, the other &s;tanding up|right. Sixty or &s;eventy grow thus together, as clo&s;e as they can &s;tand one by another, and all from the &s;ame Root, or clu&s;ter of Roots. The&s;e Penguins are encompa&s;s'd or fenced with long Leaves, about a Foot and an half, or two Foot long, and prickly like the former; and the Fruit too is much alike. They are both whol&s;ome, and never offend the Stomach; but tho&s;e that eat many, will find a heat or tickling in their Fundament. They grow &s;o plentifully in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> that there is no pa&s;&s;ing for their high prickly Leaves.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Guanoes on the&s;e I&s;lands, but no other &s;ort of Land Animal. The Bays about the I&s;lands are &s;ometimes vi&s;ited with Seals; and this was the fir&s;t place where I had &s;een any of the&s;e Animals, on the North &s;ide of the Equator, in the&s;e
<PB N="264" REF="286">
Seas. For the Fi&s;h on this &s;andy Coa&s;t lye mo&s;t in the Lagunes or Salt-lakes, and Mouths of Rivers; but the Seals come not &s;o much there, as I judge: For this being no rocky Coa&s;t, where Fi&s;h re&s;ort mo&s;t, there &s;eems to be but little Food for the Seals, unle&s;s they will venture upon Cat-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> went away from hence with 100 Men in our Canoas, to the Northward, to &s;eek for the River <HI>Coolecan,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly the &s;ame with the River of <HI>Pa&s;tla,</HI> which &s;ome Maps lay down in the Province or Region of <HI>Cullacan.</HI> This River lieth in about 24 d. N. lat. We were informed, that there is a fair rich <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town &s;eated on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it, with Savannahs about it, full of Bulls and Cows; and that the Inhabitants of this Town pa&s;s over in Boats to the I&s;land <HI>California,</HI> where they fi&s;h for Pearl. I have been told &s;ince by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that &s;aid he had been at the I&s;land <HI>California,</HI> that there are great plenty of Pearl Oy&s;ters there, and that the Native <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>California,</HI> near the Pearl-fi&s;hery, are mortal Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Our Canoas were ab&s;ent 3 or 4 Days, and &s;aid they had been above 30 leagues but found no River; that the Land by the Sea was low, and all &s;andy Bay; but &s;uch a great Sea, that there was no landing. They met us in their return in the lat. 23 d. 30 m. coa&s;ting along &s;hore after them towards <HI>Cullacan;</HI> &s;o we returned again to the Ea&s;tward. This was the farthe&s;t that I was to the N. on this Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Six or &s;even leagues N. N. W. from the I&s;les of <HI>Cha|metly,</HI> there is a &s;mall narrow entrance into a Lake, which runs about 12 leagues Ea&s;terly, parallel with the &s;hore, making many &s;mall low Mangrove I&s;lands. The Mouth of this Lake is in lat. about 23 d. 30 m. It is called by the <HI>Spaniards Rio de Sall:</HI> for it is a &s;alt Lake. There is Water enough for Boats and Canoas to enter, and &s;mooth landing af|ter you are in. On the We&s;t-&s;ide of it, there is an

Hou&s;e, and an E&s;tantion, or Farm of large Cattle. Our Men went into the Lake and landed, and coming to the Hou&s;e, found 7 or 8 Bu&s;hels of Maiz: but the Cattle were driven away by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet there our Men took the Owner of the E&s;tantion, and brought him aboard. He &s;aid, that the Beefs were driven a great way in the Country for fear we &s;hould kill them. While we lay here, Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> went into this Lake again, and landed 150 Men on the N. E. &s;ide, and marched into the Country: About a Mile from the Landing-place, as they were entring a dry <HI>Salina,</HI> or Salt-pond, they fired at two <HI>Indians</HI> that cro&s;s'd the way before them; one of them being wounded in the Thigh, fell down, and being examined, he told our Men, that there was an <HI>Indian</HI> Town 4 or 5 leagues off, and that the way which they were going would bring them thither. While they were in Di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>Indian</HI> they were attack'd by 100 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;emen, who came with a de&s;ign to &s;care them back, but wanted both Arms and Hearts to do it.</P>
<P>Our Men pa&s;t on from hence, and in their way marched through a Savannah of long dry Gra&s;s. This the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;et on fire, thinking to burn them, but that did not hinder our Men from marching forward, though it did trouble them a little. They rambled for want of Guides all this Day, and part of the next, before they came to the Town the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;poke of. There they found a com|pany of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who made head again&s;t them, but were driven out of the Town after a &s;hort Di&s;pute. Here our Surgeon and one Man more were wounded with Arrows, but none of the re&s;t were hurt. When they came into the Town they found two or three <HI>Indians</HI> wounded, who told them that the Name of the Town was <HI>Ma&s;&s;aclan;</HI> that there were a few <HI>Spaniards</HI> living in it, and the re&s;t were <HI>Indians;</HI> that five Leagues from this Town
<PB N="266" REF="288">
there were two rich Gold Mines, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> which is the chiefe&s;t Town in the&s;e parts, kept many Slaves and <HI>Indians</HI> at Work for Gold. Here our Men lay that Night, and the next Morning packt up all the Maiz that they could find, and brought it on their backs to the Canoas, and came aboard.</P>
<P>We lay here till the 2d of <HI>February,</HI> and then Captain <HI>Swan</HI> went away with about 80 Men to the River <HI>Ro&s;ario;</HI> where they landed, and marched to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town of the &s;ame Name. They found it about 9 Mile from the Sea; the way to it fair and even. This was a fine little Town, of about 60 or 70 Hou&s;es, with a fair Church; and it was chiefly inhabited with <HI>Indians,</HI> they took Pri&s;oners there, which told them, That the River <HI>Ro&s;ario</HI> is rich in Gold, and that the Mines are not above two Leagues from the Town. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> did not think it convenient to go to the Mines, but made ha&s;te aboard with the Maiz which he took there, to the quantity of about 80 or 90 Bu&s;hels; and which to us, in the &s;carcity we were in of Provi&s;ions, was at that time more valuable than all the Gold in the World; and had he gone to the Mines, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would probably have de&s;troyed the Corn before his return. The 3d of <HI>February,</HI> we went with our Ships al&s;o towards the River <HI>Ro&s;ario,</HI> and Anchored the next Day again&s;t the Rivers mouth, 7 fathom, good ouzy ground, a League from the &s;hoar. This River is in lat. 22d. 51 m. N. When you are at an Anchor again&s;t this River, you will &s;ee a round Hill, like a Sugar-loaf, a little way within Land, right over the River, and bearing N. E. by N. To the We&s;tward of that Hill there is another pretty long Hill, called by the <HI>Spaniards Caput Cavalli,</HI> or the Hor&s;e's head.</P>
<P>The 7th day Captain <HI>Swan</HI> came a board with the Maiz which he got. This was but a &s;mall quantity for &s;o many Men as we were, e&s;pecially con&s;idering
<PB N="267" REF="289">
the place we were in, being &s;trangers, and having no Pilots to direct or guide us into any River; and we being without all &s;ort of Provi&s;ion, but what we were forced to get in this manner from the &s;hoar. And though our Pilot-Book directed us well enough to find the Rivers, yet for want of Guides to carry us to the Settlements, we were forced to &s;earch 2 or 3 Days before we could find a place to land: for, as I have &s;aid before, be&s;ides the Seas being too rough for landing in many places, they have neither Boat, Bark, nor Canoa, that we could ever &s;ee or hear of: and therefore as there are no &s;uch land|ing places in the&s;e Rivers, as there are in the <HI>North Seas;</HI> &s;o when we were landed, we did not know which way to go to any Town, except we acciden|tally met with a path. Indeed, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> whom we had aboard, knew the Names of &s;everal Rivers and Towns near them, and knew the Towns when they &s;aw them; but they knew not the way to go to them from the Sea.</P>
<P>The 8th day, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;ent about 40 Men to &s;eek for the River <HI>Oleta,</HI> which is to the Ea&s;t|ward of the River <HI>Ro&s;ario.</HI> The next day we fol|lowed after with the Ships, having the Wind at W. N. W. and fair weather. In the Afternoon our Canoas came again to us, for they could not find the River <HI>Oleta;</HI> therefore we de&s;igned next for the River <HI>St. Jago,</HI> to the Ea&s;tward &s;till. The 11th day in the Evening, we Anchored again&s;t the mouth of the River, in 7 fathom Water, good &s;oft ouzy ground, and about two Mile from the &s;hoar. There was a high white Rock without us, called <HI>Maxentelbo.</HI> This Rock at a di&s;tance, appears like a Ship under &s;ail; it bore from us W. N. W. di&s;tant about 3 Leagues. The Hill <HI>Zeli&s;co</HI> bore S. E. which is a very high Hill in the Country, with a Saddle or bending on the top. The River <HI>St. Jago</HI> is in lat. 22 d. 15 m. It is one of the principal Rivers on
<PB N="268" REF="290">
this Coa&s;t; there is 10 Foot Water on the Bar at low Water, but how much it flows here I know not. The mouth of this River is near half a Mile broad, and very &s;mooth entring. Within the mouth it is broader, for there are three or four Ri|vers more meet there, and i&s;&s;ue all out together, is fre&s;h Water, is bracki&s;h a great way up; yet there, the Water is to be had, by digging or making Wells in the &s;andy Bay, two or three Foot deep, ju&s;t at the mouth of the River.</P>
<P>The 11th Day Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;ent 70 Men in four Canoas into this River, to &s;eek a Town; for al|though we had no intelligence of any, yet the Country appearing very promi&s;ing, we did not que&s;tion but they would find Inhabitants before they returned. They &s;pent two Days in rowing up and down the Creeks and Rivers; at la&s;t they came to a large Field of Maiz, which was almo&s;t ripe: they immediately fell to gathering as fa&s;t as they could, and intended to lade the Canoas; but &s;eeing an <HI>Indian</HI> that was &s;et to watch the Corn, they quitted that trouble&s;ome and tedious work, and &s;eiz'd him, and brought him aboard, in hopes by his information, to have &s;ome more ea&s;ie and ex|pedite way of a &s;upply, by finding Corn ready cut and dried. He being examined, &s;aid, that there was a Town called <HI>Santa Pecaque,</HI> four leagues from the place where he was taken, and that if we de|&s;igned to go thither he would undertake to be our Guide. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> immediately ordered his Men to make ready, and the &s;ame Evening went away with Eight Canoas and 140 Men, taking the <HI>Indian</HI> for their Guide.</P>
<P>He rowed about five Leagues up the River, and landed the next Morning. The River at this place was not above Pi&s;tol-&s;hot wide, and the Banks pretty high on each &s;ide, and the Land plain and even. He left 23 Men to guard the Canoas, and
<PB N="269" REF="291">
marcht with the re&s;t to the Town. He &s;et out from the Canoas at &s;ix a Clock in the Morning, and reach'd the Town by 10. The way through which he pa&s;&s;ed was very plain, part of it Wood-land, part Savannahs The Savannahs were full of Hor&s;es, Bulls and Cows. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eeing him coming run all away; &s;o he entred the Town without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Santa Pecaque</HI> &s;tands on a Plain, in a Savannah, by the &s;ide of a Wood, with many Fruit Trees about it. It is but a &s;mall Town, but very regular, after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> mode, with a Parade in the mid&s;t. The Hou&s;es fronting the Parade had all Balconies: there were two Churches; one a|gain&s;t the Parade, the other at the end of the Town. It is inhabited mo&s;t with <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Their chiefe&s;t occupation is Husbandry. There are al&s;o &s;ome Carriers, who are imployed by the Merchants of <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> to Trade for them to and from the Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Compo&s;tella</HI> is a rich Town, about 21 leagues from hence. It is the chiefe&s;t in all this part of the King|dom, and is reported to have 70 white Families; which is a great matter in the&s;e parts; for it may be, that &s;uch a Town hath not le&s;s than 500 Fami|lies of copper-coloured People, be&s;ides the white. The Silver Mines are about five or &s;ix leagues from <HI>Santa Pecaque;</HI> where, as we were told, the Inha|bitants of <HI>Compo&s;tella</HI> had &s;ome hundreds of Slaves at Work. The Silver here, and all over the King|dom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> is &s;aid to be finer and richer in pro|portion than that of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> or <HI>Peru,</HI> tho' the Oar be not &s;o abundant; and the Carriers of this Town of <HI>Santa Pecaque,</HI> carry the Oar to <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> where it is refined. The&s;e Carriers, or Sutlers, al&s;o furni&s;h the Slaves at the Mines with Maiz, whereof here was great plenty now in the Town de&s;igned for that u&s;e: Here was al&s;o Sugar, Salt, and Salt-fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="292">
Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s only bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Santa Pecaque</HI> was to get Provi&s;ion; therefore he ordered his Men to divide them&s;elves into two parts, and by turns carry down the Provi&s;ion to the Canoas; one half remaining in the Town to &s;ecure what they had taken, while the other half were going and com|ing. In the Afternoon they caught &s;ome Hor&s;es, and the next Morning, being the 17th day, 57 Men, and &s;ome Hor&s;es, went laden with Maiz to the Canoas. They found them, and the Men left to guard them, in good order; though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had given them a &s;mall diver&s;ion, and wounded one Man: but our Men of the Canoas landed, and drove them away. The&s;e that came loaded to the Canoas left 7 Men more there, &s;o that now they were 30 Men to guard the Canoas. At Night the other returned; and the 18th Day in the Morning, that half which &s;taid the Day before at the Town, took their turn of going with every Man his bur|then, and 24 Hor&s;es-laden. Before they returned, Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and his other Men at the Town, caught a Pri&s;oner, who &s;aid, that there were near a thou&s;and Men of all colours, <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians, Negroes</HI> and <HI>Mulatto's,</HI> in arms, at a place called <HI>St. Jago,</HI> but 3 Leagues off, the chief Town on this River; that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were armed with Guns and Pi&s;tols, and the Copper-coloured with Swords and Lances. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> fearing the ill con&s;e|quence of &s;eparating his &s;mall Company, was re|&s;olved the next Day to march away with the whole Party; and therefore he ordered his Men to catch as many Hor&s;es as they could, that they might carry the more Provi&s;ion with them. Accordingly, the next Day, being the 19th Day of <HI>February</HI> 1686. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> called out his Men betimes to be gone; but they refu&s;ed to go, and &s;aid, that they would not leave the Town till all the Provi&s;ion was in the Canoas: Therefore he was forced to
<PB N="271" REF="293">
yield to them, and &s;uffered half the company to go as before: They had now 54 Hor&s;es laden, which Captain <HI>Swan</HI> ordered to be tied one to another, and the Men to go in two bodies, 25 before, and as many behind; but the Men would go at their own rate, every Man leading his Hor&s;e. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> ob&s;erved their manner of marching, and laid an Ambu&s;h about a Mile from the Town, which they managed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that falling on our body of Men, who were guarding the Corn to the Canoas, they killed them every one. Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> hearing the report of their Guns, ordered his Men, who were then in the Town with him, to march out to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;ome oppo&s;ed him, de|&s;pi&s;ing their Enemies, till two of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Hor&s;es, that had lo&s;t their Riders, came galloping into the Town in a great fright, both bridled and &s;addled, with each a pair of Hol&s;ters by their &s;ides, and one had a Carbine newly di&s;charged; which was an apparent token that our Men had been engaged, and that by Men better armed than they imagined they &s;hould meet with. Therefore Captain <HI>Swan</HI> immediately march'd out of the Town, and his Men all followed him; and when he came to the place where the Engagement had been, he &s;aw all his Men that went out in the Morn|ing lying dead. They were &s;tript, and &s;o cut and mangl'd that he &s;carce knew one Man. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had not more Men then with him, than tho&s;e were who lay dead before him, yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never came to oppo&s;e him, but kept at a great di|&s;tance; for 'tis probable, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had not cut off &s;o many Men of ours, but with the lo&s;s of a great many of their own. So he marched down to the Canoas, and came aboard the Ship with the Maiz that was already in the Canoas. We had a|bout 50 Men killed, and among the re&s;t, my Inge|nious Friend Mr. <HI>Ringro&s;e</HI> was one, who wrote that
<PB N="272" REF="294">
Part of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Buccaneers,</HI> which relates to Captain <HI>Sharp.</HI> He was at this time Cape-Mer|chant, or Super-Cargo of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Ship. He had no mind to this Voyage; but was nece&s;&s;itated to engage in it or &s;tarve.</P>
<P>This lo&s;s di&s;couraged us from attempting any thing more hereabouts. Therefore Captain <HI>Swan</HI> propo&s;ed to go to Cape <HI>St. Lucas</HI> on <HI>California</HI> to careen. He had two rea&s;ons for this: Fir&s;t, that he thought he could lye there &s;ecure from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and next, that if he could get a Commerce with the <HI>Indians</HI> there, he might make a di&s;covery in the Lake of <HI>California,</HI> and by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance try for &s;ome of the Plate of <HI>New Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>This Lake of <HI>California</HI> (for &s;o the Sea, Channel or Streight, between that and the Continent, is called) is but little known to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by what I could ever learn; for their Drafts do not agree about it. Some of them do make <HI>California</HI> an I&s;land, but give no manner of account of the Tides flowing in the Lake, or what depth of Water there is, or of the Harbours, Rivers, or Creeks, that border on it: Whereas on the We&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, towards the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Coa&s;t, their Pilot-Book gives an account of the Coa&s;t from Cape St. <HI>Lucas</HI> to 40 d. North. Some of their Drafts newly made do make <HI>California</HI> to join to the Main. I do believe that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do not care to have this Lake di&s;|covered, for fear le&s;t other <HI>European</HI> Nations &s;hould get knowledge of it, and by that means vi&s;it the Mines of <HI>New Mexico.</HI> We heard that not long before our arrival here, the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Province of <HI>New Mexico</HI> made an In&s;urrection, and de&s;troyed mo&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there, but that &s;ome of them flying towards the Gulph or Lake of <HI>California,</HI> made Canoas in that Lake, and got &s;afe away; though the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Lake of <HI>California,</HI> &s;eem to be at perfect Enmity with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We had
<PB N="273" REF="295">
an old intelligent <HI>Spaniard</HI> now aboard, who &s;aid that he &s;poke with a Frier that made his E&s;cape among them.</P>
<P><HI>New Mexico,</HI> by report of &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners there, and <HI>Spaniards</HI> I have met with, lieth N. W. from <HI>Old Mexico</HI> between four and 500 Leagues, and the bigge&s;t part of the Trea&s;ure which is found in this Kingdom, is in that Province; but without doubt there are plenty of Mines in other parts, as well in this part of the Kingdom where we now were, as in other places; and probably, on the Main, bordering on the Lake of <HI>California;</HI> al|though not yet di&s;covered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have Mines enough, and therefore, as yet, have no rea&s;on to di&s;cover more.</P>
<P>In my opinion, here might be very advantageous Di&s;coveries made by any that would attempt it: for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have more than they can well manage. I know, they would lie like the <HI>Dog in the Man|ger;</HI> altho' not able to eat them&s;elves, yet they would endeavour to hinder others. But the Voyage thither being &s;o far, I take that to be one rea&s;on that hath hindered the Di&s;coveries of the&s;e parts: yet it is po&s;&s;ible, that a Man may find a nearer way hither than we came; I mean by the North We&s;t.</P>
<P>I know there have been divers attempts made about a North We&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, and all un&s;ucce&s;sful: yet I am of opinion, that &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age may be found. All our Countrymen that have gone to di&s;cover the N. W. Pa&s;&s;age, have endeavoured to pa&s;s to the We&s;tward, beginning their &s;earch along <HI>Davis</HI>'s or <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay.</HI> But if I was to go on this Di&s;covery, I would go fir&s;t into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> bend my cour&s;e from thence along by <HI>California,</HI> and that way &s;eek a Pa&s;&s;age back into the <HI>We&s;t Seas.</HI> For as others have &s;pent the Summer, in fir&s;t &s;earching on this more known &s;ide nearer home, and &s;o before they got through, the time of the
<PB N="274" REF="296">
year obliged them to give over their &s;earch, and provide for a long Cour&s;e back again, for fear of being left in the Winter; on the contrary, I would &s;earch fir&s;t on the le&s;s known Coa&s;t of the South Sea-&s;ide, and then as the Year pa&s;t away, I &s;hould need no retreat, for I &s;hould come farther into my knowledge, if I &s;ucceeded in my attempt, and &s;hould be without that Dread and Fear which the others mu&s;t have in pa&s;&s;ing from the known to the un|known: who, for ought I know, gave over their &s;earch ju&s;t as they were on the point of accompli&s;h|ing their De&s;ires.</P>
<P>I would take the &s;ame Method if I was to go to di&s;cover the North-Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age. I would winter about <HI>Japan, Corea,</HI> or the North-Ea&s;t part of <HI>Chi|na;</HI> and taking the Spring and Summer before me, I would make my fir&s;t trial on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tar|tary,</HI> wherein, if I &s;ucceeded, I &s;hould come into &s;ome known Parts, and have a great deal of time before me to reach <HI>Archangel</HI> or &s;ome other Port. Captain <HI>Wood,</HI> indeed, &s;ays, this N. Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age is not to be found for Ice: but how often do we &s;ee that &s;ometimes De&s;igns have been given over as impo&s;&s;ible, and at another time, and by other ways, tho&s;e very things have been accompli&s;hed; but enough of this.</P>
<P>The next day after that fatal Skirmi&s;h near <HI>Santa Pecaque,</HI> Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> ordered all our Water to be filled, and to get ready to &s;ail. The 21&s;t day we &s;ailed from hence, directing our Cour&s;e towards <HI>Ca|lifornia:</HI> we had the wind at N. W. and W. N. W. a &s;mall gale, with a great Sea out of the We&s;t. We pa&s;t by 3 I&s;lands called the <HI>Maria</HI>'s. After we pa&s;t the&s;e I&s;lands we had much wind at N. N. W. and N. W. and at N. with thick rainy weather. We beat till the 6th day of <HI>February,</HI> but it was again&s;t a brisk wind, and proved labour in vain. For we were now within reach of the Land Trade-wind,
<PB N="275" REF="297">
which was oppo&s;ite to us: but would we go to <HI>Cali|fornia</HI> upon the di&s;covery, or otherwi&s;e we &s;hould bear 60 or 70 Leagues off from the &s;hoar; where we &s;hould avoid the Land-winds, and have the be|nefit of the true Ea&s;terly Trade-wind.</P>
<P>Finding therefore that we got nothing, but ra|ther lo&s;t ground, being then 21 d. 5 m. N. we &s;teered away more to the Ea&s;tward again for the I&s;lands <HI>Maria</HI>'s, and the 7th day we came to an an|chor at the Ea&s;t-end of the middle I&s;land, in 8 fa|thom Water, good clean Sand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maria</HI>'s are three uninhabited I&s;lands in lat. 21 d. 40 m. they are di&s;tant from Cape <HI>St. Lu|cas</HI> on <HI>California</HI> 40 leagues, bearing Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t, and they are di&s;tant from Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> 20 leagues, bearing upon the &s;ame points of the Com|pa&s;s with Cape <HI>St. Lucas.</HI> They &s;tretch N. W. and S. E. about 14 leagues. There are 2 or 3 &s;mall high Rocks near them: The we&s;termo&s;t of them is the bigge&s;t I&s;land of the three; and they are all three of an indifferent heighth. The Soil is &s;tony and dry, the Land in mo&s;t places is covered with a &s;hrubby &s;ort of Wood, very thick and trouble|&s;ome to pa&s;s through. In &s;ome places there is plen|ty of &s;traight large Cedars, though &s;peaking of the places where I have found Cedars, Chap. 3. I for|got to mention this place. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> make mention of them in other places: but I &s;peak of tho&s;e which I have &s;een. All round by the Sea-&s;ide it is &s;andy; and there is produced a green prickly Plant, who&s;e leaves are much like the Penguin-leaf, and the root like the root of a <HI>Sempervive,</HI> but much larger. This root being bak'd in an Oven is good to eat: and the <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>California,</HI> as I have been informed, have great part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the&s;e Roots. We made an Oven in a &s;andy Bank, and baked of the&s;e Roots, and I eat of them: but none of us greatly cared for them. They ta&s;te ex|actly
<PB N="276" REF="298">
like the Roots of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Burdock boil'd, of which I have eaten. Here are plenty of Gua|noes and Raccoons (a large &s;ort of Rat) and <HI>Indian</HI> Conies, and abundance of large Pigeons and Turtle-Doves. The Sea is al&s;o pretty well &s;tored with Fi&s;h, and Turtle or Tortoi&s;e, and Seal. This is the &s;e|cond place on this Coa&s;t where I did &s;ee any Seal: and this place helps to confirm what I have ob&s;er|ved, that they are &s;eldom &s;een but where there is plenty of Fi&s;h. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> gave the middle I&s;land the Name of <HI>Prince George's I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>The 8th Day we run nearer the I&s;land, and ancho|red in five fathom, and moored Head and Stern, and unrigg'd both Ship and Bark, in order to Careen. Here Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> propo&s;ed to go into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> Many were well plea&s;ed with the Voyage; but &s;ome thought, &s;uch was their Ignorance, that he would carry them out of the World; for about two thirds of our Men did not think there was any &s;uch way to be found; but at la&s;t he gained their Con&s;ents.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t coming hither we did eat nothing but Seal; but after the fir&s;t 2 or 3 Days our Strikers brought aboard Turtle every Day; on which we fed all the time that we lay here, and &s;aved our Maiz for our Voyage. Here al&s;o we mea&s;ured all our Maiz, and found we had about 80 Bu&s;hels. This we divided into three parts; one for the Bark, and two for the Ship; our Men were divided al&s;o, 100 Men aboard the Ship, and 50 aboard the Bark, be&s;ides three or four Slaves in each.</P>
<P>I had been a long time &s;ick of a Drop&s;ie, a Di|&s;temper, whereof, as I &s;aid before, many of our Men died; &s;o here I was laid and covered all but my Head in the hot Sand: I indured it near half an Hour, and then was taken out and laid to Sweat in a Tent. I did &s;weat exceedingly while I was in the Sand, and I do believe it did me much good, for I grew well &s;oon after.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="299">
VVe &s;taid here till the 26th Day, and then both Ve&s;&s;els being clean, we &s;ailed to the Valley of <HI>Balderas</HI> to VVater, for we could not do it here now. In the wet Sea&s;on indeed here is VVater enough, for the Brooks then run down plentifully; but now, though there was VVater, yet it was bad filling, it being a great way to fetch it from the holes where it lodged. The 28th Day we anchored in the bottom of the Bay in the Valley of <HI>Balderas,</HI> right again&s;t the River, where we watered before; but this River was bracki&s;h now in the dry &s;ea&s;on; and therefore we went 2 or 3 Leagues nearer Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> and anchored by a &s;mall round I&s;land, not half a Mile from the Shoar. The I&s;land is about four Leagues to the Northward of the Cape; and the Brook where we filled our VVater is ju&s;t within the I&s;land, upon the Main. Here our Strikers &s;truck 9 or 10 <HI>Jew-fi&s;h;</HI> &s;ome we did eat, and the re&s;t we &s;alted: and the 29th Day we fill'd 32 Tuns of very good VVater.</P>
<P>Having thus provided our &s;elves, we had nothing more to do, but to put in execution our intended Expedition to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> in hopes of &s;ome better &s;ucce&s;s there, than we had met with on this little frequented Coa&s;t. VVe came on it full of ex|pectations; for be&s;ides the richne&s;s of the Coun|try, and the probability of finding &s;ome Sea-Ports worth vi&s;iting, we per&s;waded our &s;elves that there mu&s;t needs be Shipping and Trade here, and that <HI>Acapulca</HI> and <HI>La Vera Cruz</HI> were to the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> what <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Portobel</HI> are to that of <HI>Pe|ru, viz.</HI> Marts for carrying on a con&s;tant Commerce between the South and North Seas, as indeed they are. But whereas we expected that this Commerce &s;hould be managed by Sea, we found our &s;elves mi&s;taken: that of <HI>Mexico</HI> being almo&s;t wholly a Land-trade, and managed more by Mules than by Ships: &s;o that in&s;tead of profit we met with little

on this Coa&s;t, be&s;ides fatigues, hard&s;hips and lo&s;&s;es, and &s;o were the more ea&s;ily induced to try what better fortune we might have in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> But to do right to Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> he had no in|tention to be as a Privateer in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> but, as he hath often a&s;&s;ured me with his own Mouth, he re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of return|ing to <HI>England:</HI> So that he feigned a compliance with &s;ome of his Men, who were bent upon going to crui&s;e at <HI>Manila,</HI> that he might have lei&s;ure to take &s;ome favourable opportunity of quitting the Privateer Trade.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have given an Account in the la&s;t Chapter of the Re&s;olutions we took of going over to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> But having more calmly con&s;idered on the length of our Voyage, from hence to <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, which is the fir&s;t place that we could to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch at, and there al&s;o being not certain to find Provi&s;ions, mo&s;t of our Men were almo&s;t daunted at the thoughts of it; for we had not 60 days Provi&s;ion, at a little more than half a pint of Maiz a day for each Man, and no other Provi&s;ion, except 3 Meals of &s;alted <HI>Jew-fi&s;h;</HI> and we had a great many Rars aboard, which we could not hinder from eating part of our Maiz. Be&s;ide, the great di&s;tance between Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> and <HI>Guam:</HI> which is variou&s;ly &s;et down. The <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="302">
who have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to know be&s;t, make it to be between 2300 and 2400 Leagues; our Books al&s;o reckon it differently, between 90 and 100 degrees, which all comes &s;hort indeed of 2000 Leagues, but even that was a Voyage enough to frighten us, con&s;idering our &s;canty Provi&s;ions. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> to encourage his Men to go with him, per&s;waded them that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Books did give the be&s;t account of the di&s;tance; his Rea&s;ons were many, although but weak. He urged among the re&s;t, that Sir <HI>Thomas Candi&s;h</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> did run it in le&s;s than 50 Days, and that he did not que&s;tion but that our Ships were better &s;ailers, than tho&s;e which were built in that Age, and that he did not doubt to get there in little more than 40 Days: This being the be&s;t time in the Year for breezes, which undoubtedly is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;et out from <HI>Acapulco</HI> about this time; and that although they are 60 Days in their Voyage, it is becau&s;e they are great Ships, deep laden, and very heavy &s;ailers; be&s;ides, they wanting nothing, are in no great ha&s;te in their way, but &s;ail with a great deal of their u&s;ual Caution. And when they come near the I&s;land <HI>Guam,</HI> they lie by in the Night for a Week, before they make Land. In prudence we al&s;o &s;hould have contrived to lie by in the Night when we came near Land, for other|wi&s;e we might have run a&s;hoar, or have out&s;ailed the I&s;lands, and lo&s;t &s;ight of them before Morning. But our bold Adventures &s;eldom proceed with &s;uch warine&s;s when in any &s;traights.</P>
<P>But of all Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Arguments, that which prevailed mo&s;t with them was, his promi&s;ing them, as I have &s;aid, to crui&s;e off the <HI>Manila</HI>'s. So he and his Men being now agreed, and they incouraged with the hope of gain, which works its way thro' all Difficulties, we &s;et out from Cape <HI>Corrientes March</HI> the 31&s;t, 1686. We were 2 Ships in Company,
<PB N="281" REF="303">
Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Ship, and a Bark commanded un|der Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> by Captain <HI>Teat,</HI> and we were 150 Men, 100 aboard of the Ship, and 50 aboard the Bark, be&s;ide Slaves, as I &s;aid.</P>
<P>We had a &s;mall Land-wind at E. N. E. which carried us 3 or 4 Leagues, then the Sea-wind came at W. N. W. a fre&s;h gale, &s;o we &s;teered away S. W. By 6 a Clock in the Evening we were about 9 leagues S. W. from the Cape, then we met a Land-wind which blew fre&s;h all Night, and the next Morning about 10 a Clock we had the Sea-breez at N. N. E. &s;o that at Noon we were 30 leagues from the Cape. It blew a fre&s;h gale of Wind, which carried us off into the true Trade-wind, (of the difference of which Trade-winds I &s;hall &s;peak in the Chapter of Winds, in the Appendix) for although the con|&s;tant Sea-breez near the Shoar is at W. N. W. yet the true Trade off at Sea, when you are clear of the Land-winds, is at E. N. E. At fir&s;t we had it at N. N. E. &s;o it came about Northerly, and then to the Ea&s;t as we run off. At 250 leagues di&s;tance from the Shoar we had it at E. N. E. and there it &s;tood till we came within 40 leagues of <HI>Guam.</HI> When we had eaten up our 3 Meals of &s;alted <HI>Jew|fi&s;h,</HI> in &s;o many Days time, we had nothing but our &s;mall allowance of Maiz.</P>
<P>After the 31&s;t Day of <HI>March</HI> we made great runs every Day, having very fair clear Weather, and a fre&s;h Trade wind, which we made u&s;e of with all our Sails, and we made many good <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> of the Sun. At our fir&s;t &s;etting out, we &s;teer'd into the lat. of 13 degrees, which is near the lat. of <HI>Guam;</HI> then we &s;teered We&s;t, keeping in that lat. By that time we had &s;ailed 20 Days, our Men &s;ee|ing we made &s;uch great runs, and the Wind like to continue, repined becau&s;e they were kept at &s;uch &s;hort allowance. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> endeavoured to per&s;wade them to have a little Patience; yet
<PB N="282" REF="304">
nothing but an augmentation of their daily allow|ance would appea&s;e them. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> though with much reluctance, gave way to a &s;mall en|largement of our Commons, for now we had not above 10 &s;poonfuls of boil'd Maiz a Man, once a day, whereas before we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">: I do believe that this &s;hort allowance did me a great deal of good, though others were weakened by it; for I found that my Strength encrea&s;ed, and my Drop&s;ie wore off. Yet I drank 3 times every 24 Hours; but many of our Men did not drink in 9 or 10 days time, and &s;ome not in 12 days; one of our Men did not drink in 17 days time, and &s;aid he was not adry when he did drink; yet he made water every day more or le&s;s. One of our Men in the mid&s;t of the&s;e hard&s;hips was found guilty of theft, and condemned for the &s;ame, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> blows from each Man in the Ship, with a 2 inch and a half rope on his bare back. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> began fir&s;t, and &s;truck with a good will; who&s;e example was followed by all of us.</P>
<P>It was very &s;trange, that in all this Voyage we did not &s;ee one Fi&s;h, not &s;o much as a Flying-Fi&s;h, nor any &s;ort of Fowl; but at one time, when we were by my account 4975 miles We&s;t from Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> then we &s;aw a great number of Boobies, which we &s;uppo&s;ed came from &s;ome Rocks not far from us, which were mentioned in &s;ome of our Sea-Carts, but we did not &s;ee them.</P>
<P>After we had run the 1900 Leagues by our reck|oning, which made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> account to <HI>Guam,</HI> the Men began to murmur again&s;t Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> for per&s;wading them to come this Voyage; but he gave them fair words, and told them that the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> account might probably be the true&s;t, and &s;ee|ing the Gale was likely to continue, a &s;hort time longer would end our troubles.</P>

As we drew nigh the I&s;land, we met with &s;ome &s;mall Rain, and the Clouds &s;ettling in the We&s;t, were an apparent token that we were not far from Land; for in the&s;e Climates, betwixt or near the Tropicks, where the Trade-wind blows con&s;tantly, the Clouds which fly &s;wift over head, yet &s;eem near the Limb of the Horizon to hang without much motion or alteration, where the Land is near. I have often taken notice of it, e&s;pecially if it is high Land, for you &s;hall then have the Clouds hang about it without any vi&s;ible motion.</P>
<P>The 20th day of <HI>May,</HI> our Bark being about 3 Leagues a-head of our Ship, &s;ailed over a rocky Shole, on which there was but 4 fathom water, and abundance of Fi&s;h &s;wimming about the Rocks. They imagin'd by this that the Land was not far off; &s;o they clap'd on a Wind with the Barks Head to the North, and being pa&s;t the Shole lay by for us. When we came up with them, Captain <HI>Teat</HI> came aboard us, and related what he had &s;een. We were then in lat. 12. d. 55 m. &s;teering We&s;t. The I&s;land <HI>Guam</HI> is laid down in Lat. 13. d. N. by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are Ma&s;ters of it, keeping it as a baiting-place as they go to the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands. Therefore we clap'd on a Wind and &s;tood to North-ward, being &s;omewhat troubled and doubtful whe|ther we were right, becau&s;e there is no Shole laid down, in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Drafts about the I&s;land <HI>Guam,</HI> At 4 a Clock, to our great Joy, we &s;aw the I&s;land <HI>Guam,</HI> at about 8 Leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was well for Captain <HI>Swan</HI> that we got &s;ight of it before our Provi&s;ion was &s;pent, of which we had but enough for 3 days more; for, as I was af|terwards informed, the Men had contrived, fir&s;t to kill Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and eat him when the Victuals was gone, and after him all of us who were acce&s;|&s;ary in promoting the undertaking this Voyage. This made Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;ay to me after our ar|arrival
<PB N="284" REF="307">
at <HI>Guam, Ah!</HI> Dampier, <HI>you would have made them but a poor Meal;</HI> for I was as lean as the Captain was lu&s;ty and fle&s;hy. The Wind was at E. N. E. and the Land bore at N. N. E. therefore we &s;tood to the Northward, till we brought the I&s;land to bear Ea&s;t, and then we turned to get in to an anchor.</P>
<P>The account I have given hitherto of our Cour&s;e from Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> (for I have mentioned another Cape of that name in <HI>Peru,</HI> South of the Bay of <HI>Panama</HI>) to <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, hath been in the gro&s;s.

Now the I&s;land <HI>Guam</HI> bore N. N. E. 8 Leagues di&s;t. this gives 22 m. to my Lat. and takes 9 from my Meridian di&s;t. &s;o that the I&s;land is in Lat. 13: 21; and the Merid. di&s;t. from <HI>Corrientes</HI> 7302 miles; which, reduced into degrees, makes 125 d. 11 m.</P>
<P>The Table con&s;i&s;ts of 7 Columns. The fir&s;t is of the days of the Month. The 2d Column con|tains each days cour&s;e, or the point of the Compa&s;s we ran upon. The 3d gives the di&s;tance or length of &s;uch cour&s;e in <HI>Italian</HI> or Geometrical miles, (at the rate of 60 to a degree (or the Progre&s;s the Ship makes every day; and is reckoned always from noon to noon. But becau&s;e the Cour&s;e is not al|ways made upon the &s;ame Rumb in a direct line, therefore the 4th and 5th Columns &s;hew how ma|ny miles we ran to the South every day, and how many to the We&s;t; which la&s;t was our main run in this Voyage. By the 17th of <HI>April</HI> we were got pretty near into the latitude of <HI>Guam,</HI> and our Cour&s;e then lying along that parallel, our Northing and Southing con&s;equently were but little, accord|ing as the Ship deviated from its direct Cour&s;e; and &s;uch deviation is thenceforward expre&s;t by N. or S. in the 5th Column, and the Ships keeping &s;traight on the We&s;t Rumb, by 0, that is to &s;ay, no North|ing or Southing. The 6th Column &s;hews the lat. we were in every day, where R. &s;ignifies the <HI>dead Reckoning,</HI> by the running of the Logs, and Ob. &s;hews the lat. by ob&s;ervation. The 7th Column &s;hews the Wind and Weather.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I would have added an 8th Column, to &s;hew the variation of the Needle; but as it was very &s;mall in this Cour&s;e, &s;o neither did we make any ob|&s;ervation of it, above once, after we were &s;et out from the <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t. At our departure from Cape <HI>Corrientes,</HI> we found it to be 4 d. 28 m. Ea&s;terly: and the ob&s;ervation we made of it afterwards, when we had gone about a third of the Voyage,
<PB N="288" REF="311">
&s;hewed it to be &s;o near the &s;ame, to be decrea&s;ing: Neither did we ob&s;erve it at <HI>Guam,</HI> for Captain <HI>Swan</HI> who had the In&s;truments in his Cabbin, did not &s;eem much to regard it: Yet I am inclined to think that at <HI>Guam,</HI> the Variation might be either none at all, or even increa&s;ing to the We&s;tward.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>May</HI> 20th at Noon (when we begin to call it 21&s;t) we were in lat. 12 d. 50 m. N. by R. having run &s;ince the Noon before 134 Miles direct|ly We&s;t. We continued the &s;ame Cour&s;e till Two that Afternoon, for which I allow ten Miles more We&s;t &s;till, and then, finding the parallel we ran up|on to be too much Southerly, we clapt on a Wind and &s;ailed directly North, till Five in the Afternoon, having in that time run 8 Miles, and increa&s;ed our latitude &s;o many Minutes, making it 12 d. 58 m. We then &s;aw the I&s;land <HI>Guam</HI> bearing N. N. E. di|&s;tant from us about 8 leagues, which gives the latitude of the I&s;land 13 d. 20 m. And according to the account foregoing, its longitude is 125 d. 11 m. We&s;t from the Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> allowing 58 and 59 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles to a degree in the&s;e latitudes, at the common rate of 60 Miles to a degree of the Equator, as before computed.</P>
<P>As a Corollary from hence it will follow, that upon a &s;uppo&s;al of the truth of the general al|lowance, Seamen make of 60 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles to an Equinoctial degree, that the South Sea mu&s;t be of a greater breadth by 25 degrees, than it's commonly reckoned by Hydrographers, who make it only about 100, more or le&s;s. For &s;ince we found (as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay) the di&s;tance from <HI>Guam</HI> to the Ea&s;tern parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to be much the &s;ame with the common reckoning; it follows by way of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from hence, that the 25 degrees of longitude, or thereabouts, which are un|der-reckoned in the di&s;tance between <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> We&s;tward, are over-reckoned
<PB N="289" REF="312">
in the breadth of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, or the <HI>American</HI> Continent, or all together; and &s;o that Tract of the Terraqueous Globe, mu&s;t be &s;o much &s;hortned. And for a further confirmation of the fact, I &s;hall add, that as to the <HI>Aethiopick</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, its breadth mu&s;t be con&s;iderably le&s;s than 'tis generally calculated to be; if it be true what I have heard over and over, from &s;everal able Seamen, whom I have conver&s;ed with in the&s;e parts, that Ships &s;ailing from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> to <HI>New Holland,</HI> (as many Ships bound to <HI>Java,</HI> or thereabouts, keep that latitude) find them&s;elves there, (and &s;ometimes to their co&s;t) running aground when they have thought them&s;elves to be a great way off; and 'tis from hence po&s;&s;ibly, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> call that part of this Coa&s;t the Land of <HI>Indraught,</HI> (as if it magnetically drew Ships too fa&s;t to it) and give cautions to avoid it: But I rather think, 'tis the nearne&s;s of the Land, than any Whirlpool, or the like, that &s;urprizes them. As to the breadth of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, I am from good hands a&s;&s;ured, that it is over-reckoned by &s;ix, &s;even, eight, or ten de|grees; for be&s;ides the concurrent Accounts of &s;eve|ral experienced Men, who have confirmed the &s;ame to me: Mr. <HI>Canby</HI> particularly, who hath &s;ailed as a Mate in a great many Voyages, from Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and is much e&s;teem'd as a very &s;en&s;ible Man, hath often told me, that he con&s;tantly found the di&s;tance to be between 60 and 62 degrees; whereas 'tis laid down in 68, 69, 70, and 72 degrees, in the common draughts.</P>
<P>As to the &s;uppo&s;ition it &s;elf, which our Seamen make, in the allowing but 60 Miles to a Degree, I am not ignorant how much this hath been canva&s;ed of late Years e&s;pecially, and that the prevailing opi|nion hath been that about 70, or upwards, &s;hould be allowed. But till I can &s;ee &s;ome better grounds
<PB N="290" REF="313">
for the exactne&s;s of tho&s;e trials, that have been made on Land by Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> and others, con|&s;idering the inequality of the Earths &s;urface, as well as the obliquity of the way; in their allow|ing for which, I am &s;omewhat doubtful of their mea&s;ures. Upon the whole matter, I cannot but adhere to the general Sea-calculation, confirmed as to the main by daily experience, till &s;ome more certain e&s;timate &s;hall be made, than tho&s;e hither|to attempted. For we find our &s;elves, when we &s;ail North or South, to be brought to our intended place, in a time agreeable enough with what we expect upon the u&s;ual &s;uppo&s;ition, making all rea|&s;onable allowance, for the little unavoidable devi|ations Ea&s;t or We&s;t: and there &s;eems no rea&s;on why the &s;ame e&s;timate &s;hould not &s;erve us in cro&s;|&s;ing the Meridians, which we find &s;o true in Sailing under them. As to this cour&s;e of ours to <HI>Guam</HI> particularly, we &s;hould rather increa&s;e than &s;horten our e&s;timate of the length of it, con&s;idering that the Ea&s;terly Wind and Current being &s;o &s;trong, and bearing therefore our Log after us, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es; &s;hould we therefore, in ca&s;ting up the run of the Log, make allowance for &s;o much &s;pace as the Log it &s;elf drove after us (which is common|ly 3 or 4 Miles in 100, in &s;o brisk a gale as this was) we mu&s;t have reckoned more than 125 degrees; but in this Voyage we made no &s;uch allowance: (though it be u&s;ual to do it) &s;o that how much &s;o|ever this computation of mine exceeds the common Draughts, yet is it of the &s;horte&s;t, according to our experiment and calculation.</P>
<P>But to proceed with our Voyage: The I&s;land <HI>Guam</HI> or <HI>Guahon,</HI> (as the Native <HI>Indians</HI> pronounce it) is one of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, belongs to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have a &s;mall Fort with &s;ix Guns in it, with a Governour, and 20 or 30 Soldiers. They keep it for the relief and refre&s;hment of their <HI>Phi|lippine</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="314">
Ships, that touch here in their way from <HI>Acapulco</HI> to <HI>Manila,</HI> but the Winds will not &s;o ea&s;ily let them take this way back again. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> of late have named <HI>Guam,</HI> the I&s;land <HI>Maria,</HI> it is about 12 leagues long, and 4 broad, lying N. and S. It is pretty high Champain Land.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day of <HI>May,</HI> 1686. at 11 a Clock in the Evening, we anchored near the middle of the I&s;land <HI>Guam,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide; a Mile from the &s;hore. At a di&s;tance it appears flat and even, but coming near it you will find it &s;tands &s;helving, and the Ea&s;t &s;ide, which is much the highe&s;t, is fenced with &s;teep Rocks, that oppo&s;e the Violence of the Sea, which continually rage again&s;t it, being driven with the con&s;tant Trade-wind, and on that &s;ide there is no Anchoring. The We&s;t &s;ide is pretty low, and full of &s;mall &s;andy Bays, divided with as many rocky Points. The Soil of the I&s;land is reddi&s;h, dry and indifferent fruitful. The Fruits are chiefly Rice, Pine-Apples, Water-melons, Musk-melons, Oranges and Limes, Coco-nuts, and a &s;ort of Fruit called by us Bread-fruit.</P>
<P>The Coco-nut Trees grow by the Sea, on the We&s;tern &s;ide in great Groves, 3 or 4 Miles in length, and a Mile or two broad. This Tree is in &s;hape like the Cabbage-tree, and at a di&s;tance they are not to be known each from other, only the Coco-nut Tree is fuller of Branches; but the Cabbage-tree generally is much higher, tho' the Coco-nut Trees in &s;ome places are very high.</P>
<P>The Nut or Fruit grows at the head of the Tree, among the Branches and in Clu&s;ters, 10 or 12 in a Clu&s;ter. The Branch to which they grow is about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Arm, and as long, running &s;mall towards the end. It is of a yellow Colour, full of Knots, and very tough. The Nut is gene|rally bigger than a Man's Head. The outer Rind is near two Inches thick, before you come to the Shell;
<PB N="292" REF="315">
the Shell it &s;elf is black, thick, and very hard. The Kernel in &s;ome Nuts is near an Inch thick, &s;ticking to the in&s;ide of the Shell clear round, leaving a hol|low in the middle of it, which contains about a Pint, more or le&s;s, according to the bigne&s;s of the Nut, for &s;ome are much bigger than others.</P>
<P>This Cavity is full of &s;weet, delicate, whol&s;om and re&s;re&s;hing Water. While the Nut is growing, all the in&s;ide is full of this Water, without any Kernel at all; but as the Nut grows towards its Maturity, the Kernel begins to gather and &s;ettle round on the in&s;ide of the Shell, and is &s;oft like Cream; and as the Nut ripens, it increa&s;eth in &s;ub&s;tance and becomes hard. The ripe Kernel is &s;weet enough, but very hard to dige&s;t, therefore &s;eldom eaten, unle&s;s by Strangers, who know not the effects of it; but while it is young and &s;oft like Pap, &s;ome Men will eat it, &s;craping it out with a Spoon, after they have drunk the Water that was within it. I like the Water be&s;t when the Nut is almo&s;t ripe, for it is then &s;weete&s;t and briske&s;t.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Nuts are ripe and gathered, the out|&s;ide Rind becomes of a brown ru&s;ty colour; &s;o that one would think that they were dead and dry; yet they will &s;prout out like Onions, after they have been hanging in the Sun 3 or 4 Months, or thrown about in a Hou&s;e or Ship, and if planted afterward in the Earth, they will grow up to a Tree. Before they thus &s;prout out, there is a &s;mall &s;pungy round knob grows in the in&s;ide, which we call an Apple. This at fir&s;t is no bigger than the top of ones finger, but increa&s;eth daily, &s;ucking up the Water till it is grown &s;o big as to fill up the Cavity of the Coco-nut, and then it be|gins to &s;prout forth. By this time the Nut that was hard, begins to grow oily and &s;oft, thereby giving pa&s;&s;age to the Sprout that &s;prings from the
<PB N="293" REF="316">
Apple, which Nature hath &s;o contrived, that it points to the hole in the Shell, (of which there are three, till it grows ripe, ju&s;t where it's fa&s;tned by its Stalk to the Tree; but one of the&s;e holes remains open, even when it is ripe) through which it creeps and &s;preads forth its Branches. You may let the&s;e teem|ing Nuts &s;prout out a foot and half, or two foot high before you plant them, for they will grow a great while like an Onion out of their own Sub|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Liquor or Water in the Fruit, there is al&s;o a &s;ort of Wine drawn from the Tree called Toddy, which looks like Whey. It is &s;weet and very plea&s;ant, but it is to be drunk within 24 hours after it is drawn, for afterwards it grows &s;owre. Tho&s;e that have a great many Trees, draw a Spirit from the &s;owre Wine, called Arack. Arack is di|&s;till'd al&s;o from Rice, and other things in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies;</HI> but none is &s;o much e&s;teemed for ma|king Punch as this &s;ort, made of Toddy, or the &s;ap of the Coco-nut Tree, for it makes mo&s;t deli|cate Punch; but it mu&s;t have a da&s;h of Brandy to hearten it, becau&s;e this Arack is not &s;trong enough to make good Punch of it &s;elf. This &s;ort of Li|quor is chiefly u&s;ed about <HI>Goa;</HI> and therefore it has the Name of <HI>Goa</HI> Arack. The way of drawing the Toddy from the Tree, is by cutting the top of a Branch that would bear Nuts; but before it has any Fruit; and from thence the Liquor which was to feed its Fruit, di&s;tils into the hole of a Cal|laba&s;h that is hung upon it.</P>
<P>This Branch continues running almo&s;t as long as the Fruit would have been growing, and then it dries away. The Tree hath u&s;ually three fruitful Branches, which if they be all tapp'd thus, then the Tree bears no Fruit that Year; but if one or two only be tapp'd, the other will bear Fruit all the while. The Liquor which is thus drawn is emptied out of the
<PB N="294" REF="317">
Callaba&s;h duly Morning and Evening, &s;o long as it continues running, and is &s;old every Morning and Evening in mo&s;t Towns in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and great gains are produced from it even this way; but tho&s;e that di&s;til it and make Arack, reap the greate&s;t profit. There is al&s;o great profit made of the Fruit, both of the Nut and the Shell.</P>
<P>The Kernel is much u&s;ed in making Broath. When the Nut is dry, they take off the Husk, and giving two good Blows on the middle of the Nut, it breaks in two equal parts, letting the Water fall on the Ground; then with a &s;mall Iron Ra&s;p made for the purpo&s;e, the Kernel or Nut is ra&s;ped out clean, which being put into a little fre&s;h Water, makes it become white as Milk. In this milky Water they boil a Fowl, or any other &s;ort of Fle&s;h, and it makes very &s;avory Broath. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen put this Water into boiled Rice, which they eat in&s;tead of Rice|milk, carrying Nuts purpo&s;ely to Sea with them. This they learn from the Natives.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t u&s;e of the Kernel is to make Oyl, both for burning and for frying. The way to make the Oyl is to grate or ra&s;p the Kernel, and &s;teep it in fre&s;h Water; then boil it, and &s;cum off the Oyl at top as it ri&s;es: But the Nuts that make the Oyl ought to be a long time gathered, &s;o as that the Ker|nel may be turning &s;oft and oily.</P>
<P>The Shell of this Nut is u&s;ed in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> for Cups, Di&s;hes, Ladles, Spoons, and in a manner for all eating and drinking Ve&s;&s;els. Well &s;haped Nuts are often brought home to <HI>Europe,</HI> and much e&s;teem|ed. The Husk of the Shell is of great u&s;e to make Cables; for the dry Husk is full of &s;mall Strings and Threads, which being beaten, become &s;oft, and the other Sub&s;tance which was mixt among it falls a|way like Saw-du&s;t, leaving only the Strings. The&s;e are afterwards &s;pun into long Yarns, and twi&s;ted up into Balls for Convenience: and many of the&s;e
<PB N="295" REF="318">
Rope-Yarns joined together make good Cables. This Manufactory is chiefly u&s;ed at the <HI>Maldive-I&s;lands,</HI> and the Threads &s;ent in Balls into all places that Trade thither, purpo&s;ely for to make Cables. I made a Cable at <HI>Achin</HI> with &s;ome of it. The&s;e are called <HI>Coire</HI> Cables; they will la&s;t very well. But there is another &s;ort of <HI>Coire</HI> Cables (as they are called) that are black, and more &s;trong and la&s;ting; and are made of Strings that grow, like Hor&s;e-hair, at the heads of certain Trees, almo&s;t like the Coco|nut Tree. This &s;ort comes mo&s;t from the I&s;land <HI>Ti|mor.</HI> In the South Seas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do make Oa|kam to chalk their Ships, with the Husk of the Coco-nut, which is more &s;erviceable than that made of Hemp, and they &s;ay it will never rot. I have been told by Captain <HI>Knox,</HI> who wrote the Relation of <HI>Cey|lon,</HI> that in &s;ome places of <HI>India</HI> they make a &s;ort of cour&s;e Cloth of the Husk of the Coco-nut, which is u&s;ed for Sails. I my &s;elf have &s;een a &s;ort of cour&s;e Sail-cloth made of &s;uch a kind of &s;ub&s;tance; but whether the &s;ame or no I know not.</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this &s;ubject, to give the Reader a particular Account of the u&s;e and profit of a Vegetable, which is po&s;&s;ibly of all others the mo&s;t generally &s;erviceable to the conveniencies, as well as the nece&s;&s;ities of humane Life. Yet this Tree, that is of &s;uch great u&s;e, and e&s;teemed &s;o much in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> is &s;carce regarded in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> for want of the knowledge of the bene|fit which it may produce. And 'tis partly for the &s;ake of my Country-men, in our <HI>American</HI> Planta|tions, that I have &s;poken &s;o largely of it. For the hot Climates there are a very proper &s;oil for it: and indeed it is &s;o hardy, both in the rai&s;ing it, and when grown, that it will thrive as well in dry &s;an|dy ground as in rich land. I have found them grow|ing very well in low &s;andy I&s;lands (on the We&s;t of <HI>Sumatra</HI>) that are over-flowed with the Sea every
<PB N="296" REF="319">
Spring-tide; and though the Nuts there are not very big, yet this is no lo&s;s, for the Kernel is thick and &s;weet; and the Milk, or Water in the in&s;ide, is more plea&s;ant and &s;weet than of the Nuts that grow in rich ground, which are commonly large indeed, but not very &s;weet. The&s;e at <HI>Guam</HI> grow in dry ground, are of a middle &s;ize, and I think the &s;weete&s;t that I did ever ta&s;te. Thus much for the Coco-nut.</P>
<P>The Lime is a &s;ort of ba&s;tard or Crab Limon. The Tree, or Bu&s;h that bears it, is prickly, like a Thorn, growing full of &s;mall boughs. In <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other places, they make of the Lime Bu&s;h Fences about Gardens, or any other Inclo&s;ure, by planting the &s;eeds clo&s;e together, which growing up thick, &s;pread abroad, and make a very good Hedge. The Fruit is like a Limon, but a &s;maller; the rind thin, and the inclo&s;ed &s;ub&s;tance full of Juice. The Juice is very tart, yet of a plea&s;ant ta&s;te &s;weetned with Sugar. It is chiefly u&s;ed for making Punch, both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> as well a&s;hoar as at Sea, and much of it is for that pur|po&s;e yearly brought home to <HI>England,</HI> from out <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Plantations. It is al&s;o u&s;ed for a particu|lar kind of Sauce, which is called Pepper-Sauce, and is made of Cod-pepper, commonly call'd <HI>Guinea-pepper,</HI> boiled in Water, and then pickled with Salt, and mix'd with Lime-juice to pre&s;erve it. Limes grow plentiful in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> within the Tropicks.</P>
<P>The Bread-fruit (as we call it) grows on a large Tree, as big and high as our large&s;t Apple-Trees. It hath a &s;preading Head full of Branches, and dark Leaves. The Fruit grows on the Boughs like Ap|ples; it is as big as a Penny-loaf, when Wheat is at five Shillings the Bu&s;hel. It is of a round &s;hape, and hath a thick t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh rind. When the Fruit is ripe, it is yellow and &s;oft; and the ta&s;te is &s;weet
<PB N="297" REF="320">
and plea&s;ant. The Natives of this I&s;land u&s;e it for Bread: they gather it when full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in an Oven, which &s;corcheth the rind and makes it black: but they &s;crape off the out&s;ide black cru&s;t, and there remains a tender thin cru&s;t, and the in&s;ide is &s;oft, tender and white, like the crumb of a Penny Loaf. There is neither Seed nor Stone in the in&s;ide, but all is of a pure &s;ub&s;tance like Bread: it mu&s;t be eaten new, for if it is kept above 24 hours, it be|comes dry, and eats har&s;h and choaky; but 'tis ve|ry plea&s;ant before it is too &s;tale. This Fruit la&s;ts in &s;ea&s;on 8 Months in the Year; during which time the Natives eat no other &s;ort of food of Bread-kind. I did never &s;ee of this Fruit any where but here. The Natives told us, that there is plenty of this Fruit growing on the re&s;t of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands; and I did never hear of any of it any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>They have here &s;ome Rice al&s;o: but the I&s;land being of a dry Soil, and therefore not very proper for it, they do not &s;ow very much. Fi&s;h is &s;carce about this I&s;land; yet on the &s;hole that our Bark came over there was great plenty, and the Natives commonly go thither to fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Natives of this I&s;land are &s;trong bodied, large limb'd, and well-&s;hap'd. They are Copper-coloured, like other <HI>Indians:</HI> their Hair is black and long, their Eyes meanly proportioned; they have pretty high No&s;es; their Lips are pretty full, and their Teeth indifferent white. They are long vi&s;aged, and &s;tern of Countenance; yet we found them to be affable and Courteous. They are many of them troubled with a kind of a Lepro&s;ie. This di&s;temper is very common at <HI>Mindanao:</HI> therefore I &s;hall-&s;peak more of it in my next Chapter. They of <HI>Guam</HI> are otherwi&s;e very healthy, e&s;pecially in the dry &s;ea&s;on: but in the wet &s;ea&s;on, which comes in in <HI>June,</HI> and holds till <HI>October,</HI> the Air is more
<PB N="298" REF="321" MS="y">
thick and unwhol&s;ome; which occa&s;ions Fevers: but the Rains are not violent nor la&s;ting. For the I&s;land lies &s;o far We&s;terly from the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, or any other Land, that the We&s;terly Winds do &s;el|dom blow &s;o far; and when they do, they do not la&s;t long: but the Ea&s;terly Winds do con&s;tantly blow here, which are dry and healthy; and this I&s;land is found to be very healthful, as we were informed while we lay by it. The Natives are ve|ry ingenious beyond any People, in making Boats, or Proes, as they are called in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and therein they take great delight. The&s;e are built &s;harp at both ends; the bottom is of one piece, made like the bottom of a little Canoa, very neatly dug, and left of a good &s;ub&s;tance. This bottom part is in&s;tead of a Keel. It is about 26 or 28 foot long; the under part of this Keel is made round, but inclining to a wedge, and &s;mooth; and the upper part is almo&s;t flat, having a very gentle hollow, and is about a foot broad: From hence both &s;ides of the Boat are carried up to about 5 foot high with nar|row Plank, not above 4 or 5 inches broad, and each end of the Boat turns up round, very pretti|ly. But what is very &s;ingular, one &s;ide of the Boat is made perpendicular, like a Wall, while the o|ther &s;ide is rounding, made as other Ve&s;&s;els are, with a pretty full belly. Ju&s;t in the middle it is about 4 or 5 foot broad aloft, or more, according to the length of the Boat. The Ma&s;t &s;tands exactly in the middle, with a long Yard that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> up and down like a Mizen-yard. One end of it reacheth down to the end or head of the Boat, where it is placed in a notch, that is made there purpo&s;ely to receive it, and keep it fa&s;t. The other end hangs over the Stern: To this Yard the Sail is fa&s;tened. At the foot of the Sail there is another &s;mall Yard, to keep the Sail out &s;quare, and to roll up the Sail on when it blows hard; for it &s;erves in&s;tead of a
<PB N="299" REF="322">
Reef to take up the Sail to what degree they plea&s;e, according to the &s;trength of the Wind. Along the Belly-&s;ide of the Boat, parallel with it, at about 6 or 7 foot di&s;tance, lies another &s;mall Boat, or Ca|noa, being a Log of very light Wood, almo&s;t as long as the great Boat, but not &s;o wide, being not above a foot and an half wide at the upper part, and very &s;harp like a Wedge at each end. And there are two Bamboas of about 8 or 10 foot long, and as big as ones Leg, placed over the great Boats &s;ide, one near each end of it, and reaching about 6 or 7 foot from the &s;ide of the Boat: By the help of which, the little Boat is made firm and conti|guous to the other. The&s;e are generally called by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from them, <HI>Out|layers.</HI> The u&s;e of them is to keep the great Boat upright from over-&s;etting; becau&s;e the Wind here being in a manner con&s;tantly Ea&s;t, (or if it were at We&s;t it would be the &s;ame thing) and the Range of the&s;e I&s;lands, where their bu&s;ine&s;s lies to and fro, being mo&s;tly North and South, they turn the flat &s;ide of the Boat again&s;t the Wind, upon which they &s;ail, and the Belly-&s;ide, con&s;equently, with its little Boat, is upon the Lee: And the Ve&s;&s;el having a Head at each end, &s;o as to &s;ail with either of them foremo&s;t (indifferently) they need not tack, or go about, as all our Ve&s;&s;els do, but each end of the Boat &s;erves either for Head or Stern as they plea&s;e. When they ply to Windward, and are minded to go about, he that Steers bears away a little from the Wind, by which means the Stern comes to the Wind; which is now become the Head, only by &s;hifting the end of the Yard. This Boat is &s;teered with a broad Paddle, in&s;tead of a Rudder. I have been the more particular in de&s;cribing the&s;e Boats, becau&s;e I do believe, they Sail the be&s;t of any Boats in the World. I did here for my own &s;ati&s;|faction, try the &s;wi&s;tne&s;s of one of them; &s;ailing
<PB N="300" REF="323">
by our Log, we had 12 Knots on our Reel, and &s;he run it all out before the half Minute-Gla&s;s was half out; which, if it had been no more, is after the rate of 12 Mile an Hour; but I do believe &s;he would have run 24 Mile an Hour. It was very plea&s;ant to &s;ee the little Boat running a long &s;o &s;wift by the others &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Native <HI>Indians</HI> are no le&s;s dextrous in ma|naging, than in building the&s;e Boats. By report, they will go from hence to another of the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands about 30 Leagues off, and there do their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and return again in le&s;s than 12 Hours. I was told that one of the&s;e Boats was &s;ent Expre&s;s to <HI>Manila,</HI> which is above 400 Leagues, and performed the Voyage in 4 Days time. There are of the&s;e Proes or Boats u&s;ed in many places of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> but with a Belly and a little Boat on each &s;ide. Only at <HI>Mindanao</HI> I &s;aw one like the&s;e, with the Belly and a little Boat only on one &s;ide, and the other flat, but not &s;o neatly built.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Guam</HI> have neat little Hou&s;es, very hand&s;omly thatch'd with Palmeto-thatch. They in+habit together in Villages built by the Sea, on the We&s;t-&s;ide, and have <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts to in&s;truct them in the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a &s;mall Fort on the We&s;t &s;ide, near the South end, with &s;ix Guns in it. There is a Governour, and 20 or 30 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers. There are no more Spaniards on this I&s;land, be&s;ide 2 or 3 Prie&s;ts. Not long before we arrived here, the Na|tives ro&s;e on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to de&s;troy them, and did kill many: But the Governour with his Soldiers at length prevailed, and drove them out of the Fort: So when they found them&s;elves di&s;appoint|ed of their intent, they de&s;troyed the Plantations and Stock, and then went away to other I&s;lands: There were then 3 or 400 <HI>Indians</HI> on this I&s;land; but now there are not above 100; for all that were
<PB N="301" REF="324">
in this Con&s;piracy went away. As for the&s;e who yet remain, if they were not actually concerned in that broil, yet their Hearts al&s;o are bent again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> for they offered to carry us to the Fort, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the Conque&s;t of the I&s;land; but C. <HI>Swan</HI> was not for mole&s;ting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> here.</P>
<P>Before we came to an Anchor here, one of the Prie&s;ts came aboard in the Night, with 3 <HI>Indians.</HI> They fir&s;t haled us to know from whence we came, and what we were: To whom an&s;wer was made in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> that we were <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that we came from <HI>Acapulco.</HI> It being dark they could not &s;ee the make of our Ship, nor very well di&s;cern what we were: Therefore we came aboard; but perceiving the mi&s;take they were in, in taking us for a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, they endeavoured to get from us again, but we held their Boat fa&s;t, and made them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ome in. Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> received the Prie&s;t with much Civility, and conducting him into the Great Cabbin, declared, That the rea&s;on of our coming to this I&s;land was want of Provi&s;on, and that he came not in any ho&s;tile manner, but as a Friend to purcha&s;e with his Mo|ney what he wanted: And therefore de&s;ired the Prie&s;t to write a Letter to the Governour, to inform him what we were, and on what account we came. For having him now aboard, the Captain was willing to detain him as an Ho&s;tage, till we had Provi&s;ion. The <HI>Padre</HI> told Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> that Provi&s;ion was now &s;carce on the I&s;land; but he would engage, that the Governour would do his utmo&s;t to furni&s;h us.</P>
<P>In the Morning the <HI>Indians,</HI> in who&s;e Boat or Proe the Frier came aboard, were &s;ent to the Go|vernour with two Letters; one from the Frier, and another very obliging one from Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and a Pre&s;ent of four Yards of Scarlet-cloath, and a piece of broad Silver and Gold Lace. The Governour lives near the South end of the I&s;land on the We&s;t
<PB N="302" REF="325">
&s;ide; which was about 5 Leagues from the place where we were; therefore we did not expect an an&s;wer till the Evening, not knowing then how nimble they were. Therefore when the <HI>Indian</HI> Canoa was di&s;patched away to the Governour, we hoi&s;ed out 2 of our Canoas, and &s;ent one a fi&s;hing, and the other a&s;hore for Coco-nuts. Our fi&s;hing Canoa got nothing; but the Men that went a&s;hore for Coco-nuts came off laden.</P>
<P>About 11 a Clock, that &s;ame Morning, the Go|vernour of the I&s;land &s;ent a Letter to Capt. <HI>Swan,</HI> complimenting him for his Pre&s;ent, and promi&s;ing to &s;upport us with as much Provi&s;ion, as he could po&s;&s;ibly &s;pare; and as a Token of his Gratitude, he &s;ent a Pre&s;ent of 6 Hogs, of a &s;mall &s;ort, mo&s;t ex|cellent Meat, the be&s;t I think, that ever I eat: They are fed with Coco-nuts, and their Fle&s;h is hard as Brisket Beef. They were doubtle&s;s of that breed in <HI>America</HI> which came originally from <HI>Spain.</HI> He &s;ent al&s;o 12 Musk-melons, larger than ours in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and as many Water-melons, both &s;orts here being a very excellent Fruit; and &s;ent an order to the <HI>Indians</HI> that lived in a Village not far from our Ship, to bake every day as much of the Bread-fruit as we did de&s;ire, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in getting as many dry Coco-nuts as we would have; which they ac|cordingly did, and brought off the Bread-Fruit eve|ry day hot, as much as we could eat. After this the Governour &s;ent every day a Canoa or two with Hogs and Fruit, and de&s;ired for the &s;ame, Powder, Shot and Arms; which was &s;ent according to his Reque&s;t. We had a delicate large <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dog; which the Governour did de&s;ire, and had it given him very freely by the Captain, though much a|gain&s;t the grain of many of his Men, who had a great value for that Dog. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> endea|voured to get this Governour's Letter of Recom|mendation to &s;ome Merchants at <HI>Manila,</HI> for he
<PB N="303" REF="326">
had then a de&s;ign to go to Fort <HI>St. George,</HI> and from thence intended to trade to <HI>Manila:</HI> but this his de|&s;ign was concealed from the company. While we lay here, the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship arrived in &s;ight of the I&s;land, but did not come in the &s;ight of us; for the Governour &s;ent an <HI>Indian</HI> Proe, with advice of our being here. Therefore &s;he &s;tood off to the South|ward of the I&s;land, and coming foul of the &s;ame &s;hole that our Bark had run over before, was in great danger of being lo&s;t there, for &s;he &s;truck off her Rudder, and with much ado got clear; but not till after three days labour. For tho' the &s;hole be &s;o near the I&s;land, and the <HI>Indians</HI> go off and fi&s;h there every day, yet the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship, who &s;hould (one would think) know the&s;e Parts, was utterly ignorant of it. This their &s;triking on the &s;hole we heard afterward, when we were on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Manila;</HI> but the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Guam</HI> did &s;peak of her being in &s;ight of the I&s;land while we lay there, which put our Men in a great heat to go out after her, but Captain <HI>Swan</HI> per&s;waded them out of that humour, for he was now wholly aver&s;e to any Ho&s;tile action.</P>
<P>The 30th day of <HI>May,</HI> the Governor &s;ent his la&s;t Pre&s;ent, which was &s;ome Hogs, a Jar of pickled Mangoes, a Jar of excellent pickled Fi&s;h, and a Jar of fine Rusk, or Bread of fine Wheat Flower, ba|ked like Bisket, but not &s;o hard. He &s;ent be&s;ides, 6 or 7 packs of Rice, de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed from &s;ending any more Provi&s;ion to us, &s;aying he had no more on the I&s;land that he could &s;pare. He &s;ent word al&s;o, that the We&s;t Mon&s;oon was at hand, that therefore it behoved us to be jogging from hence, unle&s;s we were re&s;olved to return back to <HI>America</HI> again. Captain <HI>Swan</HI> returned him thanks for his kindne&s;s and advice, and took his leave; and the &s;ame day &s;ent the Frier a&s;hoar, that was &s;eized on at our fir&s;t arrival, and gave him a large
<PB N="304" REF="327">
Bra&s;s Clock, an A&s;trolable, and a large Tele&s;cope: for which Pre&s;ent the Frier &s;ent us aboard &s;ix Hogs, and a Roa&s;ting Pig, 3 or 4 Bu&s;hels of Potatoes, and 50 pound of <HI>Manila</HI> Tobacco. Then we prepared to be gone, being pretty well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ion to carry us to <HI>Mindanao,</HI> where we de&s;igned next to touch. We took aboard us as many Coco-nuts as we could well &s;tow, and we had a good &s;tock of Rice, and about 50 Hogs in Salt.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHile we lay at <HI>Guam,</HI> we took up a Re&s;o|lution of going to <HI>Mindanao,</HI> one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, being told by the Frier, and others, that it was exceedingly well &s;tored with Provi&s;i|ons; that the Natives were <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and that they had formerly a Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but that now they were at Wars with them. This I&s;land was therefore thought to be a convenient place for us to go to; for be&s;ides that, it was in our
<PB N="306" REF="329">
way to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> which we had re&s;olved to vi&s;it; and that the We&s;terly <HI>Mon&s;oon</HI> was at hand, which would oblige us to &s;helter &s;omewhere in a &s;hort time, and that we could not expect good Harbours in a better place than in &s;o large an I&s;land as <HI>Mindanao:</HI> be&s;ides all this, I &s;ay, the Inhabitants of <HI>Mindanao</HI> being then, as we were told, (tho' fal&s;ly) at Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> our Men, who it &s;hould &s;eem were very &s;queami&s;h of plundering without Licence, derived hopes from thence of getting a Commi&s;&s;ion there from the Prince of the I&s;land, to plunder the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships about <HI>Manila,</HI> and &s;o to make <HI>Mindanao</HI> their common Rendezvous. And it Captain <HI>Swan</HI> was minded to go to an <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Port, yet his Men, who thought he intended to leave them, hoped to get Ve&s;&s;els and Pilots at <HI>Mindanao</HI> fit for their turn, to cruize on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Manila.</HI> As for Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> he was willing enough to go thither, as be&s;t &s;uiting his own de|&s;ign; and therefore this Voyage was concluded on by general con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>June</HI> 2d, 1686. we left <HI>Guam,</HI> bound for <HI>Mindanao.</HI> We had fair Weather, and a pretty &s;mart gale of Wind at Ea&s;t, for 3 or 4 Days, and then it &s;hifted to the S. W. being Rainy, but it &s;oon came about again to the Ea&s;t, and blew a gentle gale; yet it often &s;huffled about to the S. E. For though in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> the Winds &s;hift in <HI>April,</HI> yet we found this to be the &s;hifting &s;ea&s;on for the Winds here; the other &s;hifting &s;ea&s;on being in <HI>October,</HI> &s;ooner or later, all over <HI>India.</HI> As to our cour&s;e from <HI>Guam</HI> to the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, we found it (as I intimated before) agreeable enough with the account of our common Draughts.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t Day of <HI>June</HI> we arrived at the I&s;land <HI>St. John,</HI> which is one of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands. The <HI>Philippines</HI> are a great company of large I&s;lands, ta|king up about 13 deg. of Lat. in length, reaching
<PB N="307" REF="330">
near upon, from 5 d. of North Lat. to the 19th de|gree, and in breadth about 6 deg. of Longitude. They derive this Name from <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and even now they do mo&s;t of them belong to that Crown.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t I&s;land in this range is <HI>Luconia,</HI> which lies on the North of them all. At this I&s;land <HI>Magellan</HI> died on the Voyage that he was making round the World. For after he had pa&s;t tho&s;e Streights be|tween the South end of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> which now bear his Name, and had ranged down in the <HI>South Seas</HI> on the back of <HI>America;</HI> from thence &s;tretching over to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> he fell in with the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, and from thence &s;teering Ea&s;t &s;till, he fell in with the&s;e <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and anchored at <HI>Luconia;</HI> where he warr'd with the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> to bring them in Obedience to his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was by them kill'd with a Poy|&s;oned Arrow. It is now wholly under the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> who have &s;everal Towns there. The chief is <HI>Manilo,</HI> which is a large Sea-port Town near the S. E. end, oppo&s;ite to the I&s;land <HI>Mindora.</HI> It is a place of great Strength and Trade: The two great <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ships before mentioned fetching from hence all &s;orts of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities; which are brought hither by Foreigners, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants of Fort <HI>St. George</HI> &s;end their Ships hither as it were by &s;tealth, under the charge of <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Pilots and Mariners: For as yet we cannot get the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there to a Commerce with us or the <HI>Dutch,</HI> although they have but few Ships of their own. This &s;eems to ari&s;e from a Jealou&s;ie or Fear of di&s;covering the Riches of the&s;e I&s;lands, for mo&s;t, if not all the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, are rich in Gold: And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no place of much &s;trength in all the&s;e I&s;lands that I could ever hear of, be&s;ides <HI>Manilo</HI> it &s;elf. Yet they have Villages
<PB N="308" REF="331">
and Towns on &s;everal of the I&s;lands, and Padres or Prie&s;ts to in&s;truct the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> from whom they get their Gold.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inhabitants, of the &s;maller I&s;lands e&s;pecially, would willingly trade with us if the Go|vernment was not &s;o &s;evere again&s;t it: for they have no Goods but what are brought from <HI>Manilo</HI> at an extraordinary dear rate. I am of the Opini|on, That if any of our Nations would &s;eek a Trade with them, they would not lo&s;e their labour; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can and will Smuggle (as our Seamen call Trading by &s;tealth) as well as any Nation that I know; and our <HI>Jamaicans</HI> are to their profit &s;en|&s;ible enough of it. And I have been informed that Captain <HI>Goodlud</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in a Voyage which he made from <HI>Mindanao</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> touch'd at &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands, and was civilly treated by the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> who bought &s;ome of his Commodities, giv|ing him a very good Price for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are about 12 or 14 more large I&s;lands ly|ing to the Southward of <HI>Luconia;</HI> mo&s;t of which as I &s;aid before, are inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Be|&s;ides the&s;e there are an infinite number of &s;mall I&s;lands of no account, and even the great I&s;lands, many of them, are without Names; or at lea&s;t &s;o variou&s;ly &s;et down, that I find the &s;ame I&s;lands named by divers Names.</P>
<P>The I&s;land St. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Mindanao</HI> are the Sou|thermo&s;t of all the&s;e I&s;lands, and are the only I&s;lands in all this Range that are not &s;ubject to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land is on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Min|danao,</HI> and di&s;tant from it 3 or 4 Leagues. It is in lat. about 7 or 8 North. This I&s;land is in length about 38 Leagues, &s;tretching N. N. W. and S. S. E. and it is in breadth about 24 Leagues, in the middle of the I&s;land. The Northermo&s;t end is broader, and the Southermo&s;t is narrower: This I&s;land is of a
<PB N="309" REF="332">
good heighth, and is full of many &s;mall Hills. The Land at the South-Ea&s;t end (where I was a&s;hoar) is of a black fat Mould; and the whole I&s;land &s;eems to partake of the &s;ame fatne&s;s, by the va&s;t number of large Trees that it produceth; for it looks all over like one great Grove.</P>
<P>As we were pa&s;&s;ing by the S. E. end we &s;aw a Canoa of the Natives under the &s;hoar; therefore one of our Canoas went after to have &s;poken with her; but &s;he run away from us, &s;eeing them&s;elves chaced, put their Canoa a&s;hoar, leaving her, fled into the Woods; nor would be allured to come to us, altho' we did what we could to entice them; be|&s;ides the&s;e Men, we &s;aw no more here, nor &s;ign of any Inhabitants at this end.</P>
<P>When we came aboard our Ship again, we &s;teered away for the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao,</HI> which was now fair in &s;ight of us: it being about 10 leagues di&s;tant from this part of St. <HI>John</HI>'s. The 22d day we came within a league of the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Min|danao,</HI> and having the Wind at S. E. we &s;teered toward the North-end, keeping on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, till we came into the lat. of 7 d. 40 m. and there we anchored in a &s;mall Bay, about a Mile from the Shoar, in 10 Fathom Water, Rocky foul ground.</P>
<P>Some of our Books gave us an account, That <HI>Mindanao</HI> City and I&s;le lies in 7 d. 40 m. we gue&s;t that the middle of the I&s;land might lie in this lat. but we were at a great lo&s;s where to find the City, whether on the Ea&s;t or We&s;t &s;ide. Indeed, had it been a &s;mall I&s;land, lying open to the Ea&s;tern Wind, we might probably have &s;earched fir&s;t on the We&s;t-&s;ide; for commonly the I&s;lands within the Tropicks, or within the bounds of the Trade-Winds, have their Harbours on the We&s;t-&s;ide, as be&s;t &s;heltered; but the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao</HI> being guarded on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide by St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land, we might as rea|&s;onably expect to find the Harbour and City on
<PB N="310" REF="333">
this &s;ide, as any where el&s;e: but coming into the Lat. in which we judg'd the City might be, found no Canoas, or People, that might give us any um|brage of a City, or place of Trade near at hand, tho' we coa&s;ted within a League of the Shoar.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Mindanao</HI> is the bigge&s;t of all the <HI>Phi|lippine</HI> I&s;lands, except <HI>Luconia.</HI> It is about 60 Leagues long, and 40 or 50 broad. The South end is in about 5 d. N. and the N. W. end reacheth almo&s;t to 8 d. N. It is a very Mountainous I&s;land, full of Hills and Valleys. The Mould in general is deep and black, and extraordinary fat and fruitful. The &s;ides of the Hills are &s;tony, yet productive enough of very large tall Trees. In the heart of the Coun|try there are &s;ome Mountains that yield good Gold. The Valleys are well moi&s;tned with plea|&s;ant Brooks, and &s;mall Rivers of delicate Water; and have Trees of divers &s;orts flouri&s;hing and green all the Year. The Trees in general are very large, and mo&s;t of them are of kinds unknown to us.</P>
<P>There is one &s;ort which de&s;erves particular no|tice; called by the Natives <HI>Libby-Trees.</HI> The&s;e grow wild in great Groves of 5 or 6 Miles long, by the &s;ides of the Rivers. Of the&s;e Trees Sago is made, which the poor Country People eat in&s;tead of Bread 3 or 4 Months in the Year. This Tree for its body and &s;hape is much like the Palmeto-Tree, or the Cabbage-Tree, but not &s;o tall as the latter. The Bark and Wood is hard and thin like a Shell, and full of white Pith, like the Pith of an Elder. This Tree they cut down, and &s;plit it in the mid|dle, and &s;crape out all the Pith; which they beat Iu&s;tily with a Wooden Pe&s;tle in a great Mortar or Trough, and then put it into a Cloth or Strainer held over a Trough; and pouring Water in among the Pith, they &s;tir it about in the Cloth: So the Water carries all the &s;ub&s;tance of the Pith through the Cloth down into the Trough, leaving nothing in
<PB N="311" REF="334">
the Cloth but a light &s;ort of Husk, which they throw away; but that which falls into the Trough &s;ettles in a &s;hort time to the bottom like Mud; and then they draw off the Water, and take up the muddy &s;ub&s;tance, wherewith they make Cakes; which being baked proves very good Bread.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mindanao</HI> People live 3 or 4 Months of the Year on this Food for their Bread kind. The Na|tive <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Teranate,</HI> and <HI>Tidore,</HI> and all the <HI>Spice I&s;lands,</HI> have plenty of the&s;e Trees, and u&s;e them for Food in the &s;ame manner; as I have been in|form'd by Mr. <HI>Caril Rofy,</HI> who is now Commander of one of the King's Ships. He was one of our Company at this time; and being left with Captain <HI>Swan</HI> at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> went afterwards to <HI>Teranate,</HI> and lived there among the <HI>Dutch</HI> a Year or two. The Sago which is tran&s;ported into other parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> is dried in &s;mall pieces like little Seeds or Comfits, and commonly eaten with Milk of Almonds, by tho&s;e that are troubled with the Flux; for it is a great binder, and very good in that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places of <HI>Mindanao</HI> there is plenty of Rice; but in the hilly Land they plant Yams, Po|tatoes, and Pumkins; all which thrive very well. The other Fruits of this I&s;land are Water-Melons, Musk-Melons, Plaintains, Bonanoes, Guavas, Nut|megs, Cloves, Betel-Nuts, Durians, Jacks, or Jacas, Coco-Nuts, Oranges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Plantain I take to be the King of all Fruit, not except the Coco it &s;elf. The Tree that bears this Fruit is about 3 Foot, or 3 Foot and an half round, and about 10 or 12 Foot high. The&s;e Trees are not rai&s;ed from Seed, (for they &s;eem not to have any) but from the Roots of other old Trees. If the&s;e young &s;uckers are taken out of the Ground, and planted in another place, it will be 15 Months be|fore they bear, but if let &s;tand in their own native
<PB N="312" REF="335">
Soil they will bear in 12 Months. As &s;oon as the Fruit is ripe the Tree decays, but then there are many young ones growing up to &s;upply its place. When this Tree fir&s;t &s;prings out of the Ground, it comes up with two Leaves; and by that time it is a Foot high, two more &s;prings up in the in&s;ide of them; and in a &s;hort time after two more within them; and &s;o on. By that time the Tree is a Month old, you may perceive a &s;mall body almo&s;t as big as ones Arm, and then there are eight or ten Leaves, &s;ome of them four or five Foot high. The fir&s;t Leaves that it &s;hoots forth are not above a Foot long, and half a Foot broad; and the Stem that bears them no big|ger than ones Finger; but as the Tree grows higher the Leaves are larger. As the young Leaves &s;pring up up in the in&s;ide, &s;o the old Leaves &s;pread off, and their tops droop downward, being of a greater length and breadth, by how much they are nearer the Root, and at la&s;t decay and rot off: but &s;till there are young Leaves &s;pring up out of the top, which makes the Tree look always green and flouri&s;hing. When the Tree is full grown, the Leaves are 7 or 8 Foot long, and a Foot and half broad; towards the end they are &s;maller, and end with a round point. The Stem of the Leaf is as big as a Man's Arm, almo&s;t round, and about a Foot in length, between the Leaf and the Body of the Tree. That part of the Stem which comes from the Tree, if it be the out&s;ide Leaf, &s;eems to inclo&s;e half the Body, as it were with a thick Hide; and right again&s;t it, on the other &s;ide of the Tree, is another &s;uch an&s;wering to it. The next two Leaves, in the in&s;ide of the&s;e, grow oppo&s;ite to each other, in the &s;ame manner, but &s;o that if the two outward grow North and South, the&s;e grow Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and tho&s;e &s;till within them keep the &s;ame order. Thus the Body of this Tree &s;eems to be made up of many thick Skins, growing one over another, and when it is full grown, there
<PB N="313" REF="336">
&s;prings out of the top a &s;trong Stem, harder in &s;ub|&s;tance than any other part of the Body. This Stem &s;hoots forth at the Heart of the Tree, is as big as a Man's Arm, and as long; and the Fruit grows in clu&s;ters round it, fir&s;t blo&s;&s;oming, and then &s;hooting forth the Fruit. It is &s;o excellent, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give it the preheminence of all other Fruit, as mo&s;t conducing to Life. It grows in a Cod about 6 or 7 Inches long, and as big as a Man's Arm. The Shell, Rind or Cod, is &s;oft, and of a yellow colour when ripe. It re&s;embles in &s;hape a Hogs-gut Pudding. The inclo&s;ed Fruit is no harder than Butter in Winter, and is much of the colour of the pure&s;t yellow But|ter. It is of a delicate ta&s;te, and melts in ones Mouth like Marmalet. It is all pure Pulp, without any Seed, Kernel or Stone. This Fruit is &s;o much e&s;teemed by all <HI>Europeans</HI> that &s;ettle in <HI>America,</HI> that when they make a new Plantation, they commonly begin with a good Plantain-walk, as they call it, or a Field of Plantains; and as their Family encrea&s;eth, &s;o they augment the Plantain-walk, keeping one Man pur|po&s;ely to prune the Trees, and gather the Fruit as he &s;ees convenient. For the Trees continue bearing, &s;ome or other, mo&s;t part of the Year; and this is many times the whole Food on which a whole Family &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. They thrive only in rich fat ground, for poor &s;andy will nor bear them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their Towns in <HI>America,</HI> as at <HI>Havana, Cartagena, Portabel,</HI> &amp;c. have their Markets full of Plantains, it being the common Food for poor People: Their common price is half a Riol, or 3 <HI>d.</HI> a Dozen. When this Fruit is only u&s;ed for Bread, it is roa&s;ted or boil'd when it's ju&s;t full grown, but not yet ripe, or turn'd yellow. Poor People, or Negroes, that have neither Fi&s;h nor Fle&s;h to eat with it, make Sauce with Cod-pepper, Salt and Lime-juice, which makes it eat very &s;avory; much better than a cru&s;t of Bread alone. Sometimes for
<PB N="314" REF="337">
a change they eat a roa&s;ted Plantain, and a ripe raw Plantain together, which is in&s;tead of Bread and Butter. They eat very plea&s;ant &s;o, and I have made many a good meal in this manner. Some|times our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> take 5 or 7 ripe Plantains, and ma&s;hing them together, make them into a lump, and boil them in&s;tead of a Bag-pudding; which they call a Buff-Jacket: and this is a very good way for a change. This Fruit makes al&s;o very good Tarts; and the green Plantains &s;lic'd thin, and dried in the Sun, and grated, will make a &s;ort of Flour which is very good to make Puddings. A ripe Plantain &s;lic'd and dried in the Sun may be pre&s;erved a great while; and then eats like Figs, very &s;weet and plea&s;ant. The <HI>Darien Indians</HI> pre|&s;erve them a long time, by drying them gently over the Fire; ma&s;hing them fir&s;t, and moulding them into lumps The <HI>Moskito Indians</HI> will take a ripe Plantain and roa&s;t it; then take a pint and half of Water in a Calaba&s;h, and &s;queeze the Plantain in pieces with their Hands, mixing it with the Water; then they drink it all off together: This they call <HI>Mi&s;hlaw,</HI> and it's plea&s;ant and &s;weet, and nou|ri&s;hing; &s;omewhat like Lambs-wool (as 'tis call'd) made with Apples and Ale: and of this Fruit alone many thou&s;ands of <HI>Indian</HI> Families in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> have their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. When they make Drink with them, they take 10 or 12 ripe Plantains and ma&s;h them well in a Trough: then they put 2 Gallons of Water among them; and this in 2 Hours time will ferment and froth like Wort. In 4 Hours it is fit to Drink, and then they Bottle it, and Drink it as they have occa&s;ion: but this will not keep above 24 or 30 Hours. Tho&s;e therefore that u&s;e this Drink, Brew it in this manner every Morning. When I went fir&s;t to <HI>Jamaica</HI> I could reli&s;h no other Drink they had there. It drinks brisk and cool, and is very plea&s;ant. This Drink is windy, and &s;o is the Fruit eaten raw; but
<PB N="315" REF="338">
boil'd or roa&s;ted it is not &s;o. If this Drink is kept above 30 Hours it grows &s;harp: but if then it be put out into the Sun, it will become very good Vine|gar. This Fruit grows all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> (in the proper Climates) at <HI>Guinea,</HI> and in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>As the Fruit of this Tree is of great u&s;e for Food, &s;o is the Body no le&s;s &s;erviceable to make Cloaths; but this I never knew till I came to this I&s;land. The ordinary People of <HI>Mindanao</HI> do wear no other Cloth. The Tree never bearing but once, and &s;o being fell'd when the Fruit is ripe, they cut it down clo&s;e by the Ground, if they intend to make Cloth with it. One blow with a Hachet, or long Knife, will &s;trike it a&s;under; then they cut off the top, leaving the trunk 8 or 10 foot long, &s;tripping off the outer Rind, which is thicke&s;t towards the lower end, having &s;tript 2 or 3 of the&s;e Rinds, the Trunk becomes in a manner all of one bigne&s;s, and of a whiti&s;h colour: Then they &s;plit the Trunk in the middle; which being done, they &s;plit the two halves again, as near the middle as they can. This they leave in the Sun 2 or 3 Days, in which time part of the juicy &s;ub&s;tance of the Tree dries away, and then the ends will appear full of &s;mall Threads. The Women, who&s;e employment it is to make the Cloth, take hold of tho&s;e Threads one by one, which rend away ea&s;ily from one end of the Trunk to the other, in bigne&s;s like whited brown-thread; for the threads are naturally of a determi|nate bigne&s;s, as I ob&s;erved their Cloth to be all of one &s;ub&s;tance and equal finene&s;s; but 'tis &s;tubborn when new, wears out &s;oon, and when wet, feels a little &s;limy. They make their pieces 7 or 8 Yards long, their Warp and Woof all one thickne&s;s and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of Plantains in that I&s;land, which are &s;horter and le&s;s than the others, which I never &s;aw any where but here. The&s;e are full
<PB N="316" REF="339">
of black Seeds mixt quite through the Fruit. They are binding, and are much eaten by tho&s;e that have Fluxes. The Country People gave them us for that u&s;e, and with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonano</HI> Tree is exactly like the Plantain for &s;hape and bigne&s;s, nor ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from it but by its Fruit, which is a great deal &s;maller, and not above half &s;o long as a Plantain, being al&s;o more mellow and &s;oft, le&s;s lu&s;cious, yet of a more delicate ta&s;te. They u&s;e this for the making Drink oftner than Plantains, and it is be&s;t when u&s;ed for Drink, or eaten as Fruit; but it is not &s;o good for Bread, nor doth it eat well at all when roa&s;ted or boil'd; &s;o 'tis only nece&s;&s;ity that makes any u&s;e it this way. They grow generally where Plantains do, being &s;et intermixt with them purpo&s;ely in their Plantain-walks. They have plenty of Clove-bark, of which I &s;aw a Ship load; and as for Cloves, <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention, told me, that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would &s;ettle there, they could order Matters &s;o in a little time, as to &s;end a Ship-load of Cloves from thence every Year. I have been informed that they grow on the Boughs of a Tree about as big as a Plumb-tree, but I ne|ver happened to &s;ee any of them.</P>
<P>I have not &s;een the Nutmeg-trees any where; but the Nutmegs this I&s;land produces are &s;air and large, yet they have no great &s;tore of them, being unwil|ling to propagate them or the Cloves, for fear that &s;hould invite the <HI>Dutch</HI> to vi&s;it them, and bring them into &s;ubjection, as they have done the re&s;t of the neighbouring I&s;lands where they grow. For the <HI>Dutch</HI> being &s;eated among the Spice-I&s;lands, have monopolized all the Trade into their own Hands, and will not &s;uffer any of the Natives to di&s;po&s;e of it, but to them&s;elves alone. Nay, they are &s;o careful to pre&s;erve it in their own Hands, that they will not &s;uffer the Spice to grow in the
<PB N="317" REF="340">
uninhabited I&s;lands, but &s;end Soldiers to cut the Trees down. Captain <HI>Rofy</HI> told me, that while he lived with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he was &s;ent with other Men to cut down the Spice-Trees; and that he him&s;elf did at &s;everal times cut down 7 or 800 Trees. Yet altho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> take &s;uch care to de&s;troy them, there are many uninhabited I&s;lands that have great plenty of Spice-Trees, as I have been informed by <HI>Dutch</HI> Men that have been there, particularly by a Cap|tain of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship that I met with at <HI>Achin,</HI> who told me, that near the I&s;land <HI>Banda</HI> there is an I&s;land where the Cloves falling from the Trees do lie and rot on the ground, and they are at the time when the Fruit falls, 3 or 4 Inches thick under the Trees. He and &s;ome others told me, that it would not be a hard matter for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to pur|cha&s;e a Ships Cargo of Spice, of the Natives of &s;ome of the&s;e Spice-I&s;lands.</P>
<P>He was a free Merchant that told me this. For by that name the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e Merchants who are not Ser|vants to the Company. The free Merchants are not &s;uffered to Trade to the Spice-I&s;lands, nor to many other places where the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Factories; but on the other Hand, they are &s;uffered to Trade to &s;ome places where the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company them|&s;elves may not Trade, as to <HI>Achin</HI> particularly, for there are &s;ome Princes in the <HI>Indies,</HI> who will not Trade with the Company for fear of them. The Seamen that go to the Spice-I&s;lands are obliged to bring no Spice from thence for them&s;elves, except a &s;mall matter for their own u&s;e, about a pound or two. Yet the Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Ships do common|ly &s;o order their bu&s;ine&s;s, that they often &s;ecure a good quantity, and &s;end it a&s;hoar to &s;ome place near <HI>Batavia,</HI> before they come into that Harbour, (for it is always brought thither fir&s;t before it's &s;ent to <HI>Europe,</HI>) and if they meet any Ve&s;&s;el at Sea that

will buy their Cloves, they will &s;ell 10 or 15 Tuns out of 100, and yet &s;eemingly carry their Comple|ment to <HI>Batavia;</HI> for they will pour Water among the remaining part of their Cargo, which will &s;well them to that degree, that the Ships Hold will be as full again, as it was before any were &s;old. This Trick they u&s;e whenever they di&s;po&s;e of any clan|de&s;tinely, for the Cloves when they fir&s;t take them in are extraordinary dry; and &s;o will imbibe a great deal of Moi&s;ture. This is but one In&s;tance, of many hundreds, of little deceitful Arts the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sea-Men have in the&s;e Parts among them, of which I have both &s;een and heard &s;everal. I believe there are no where greater Thieves; and nothing will per&s;uade them to di&s;cover one another; for &s;hould any do it, the re&s;t would certainly knock him on the Head. But to return to the Products of <HI>Min|danao.</HI></P>
<P>The Betel-Nut is much e&s;teemed here, as it is in mo&s;t places of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> The Betel-Tree grows like the Cabbage-Tree, but it is not &s;o big, nor &s;o high. The Body grows &s;trait, about 12 or 14 foot high, without Leaf or Branch, except at the Head. There it &s;preads forth long Bran|ches, like other Trees of the like nature, as the Cabbage-Tree, the Coco-Nut Tree, and the Palm. The&s;e Branches are about 10 or 12 foot long, and their &s;tems near the head of the Tree, as big as a Man's Arm. On the top of the Tree among the Branches the Betel-Nut grows on a tough &s;tem, as big as a Man's Finger, in clu&s;ters much as the Coco-Nuts do, and they grow 40 or 50 in a clu&s;ter. This Fruit is bigger than a Nutmeg, and is much like it, but rounder. It is much u&s;ed all over the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> Their way is to cut it in four pieces, and wrap one of them up in an Arek leaf, which they &s;pread with a &s;oft Pa&s;te made of Lime or Pla&s;ter, and then chew it altogether.
<PB N="319" REF="342">
Every Man in the&s;e parts carries his Lime-Box by his &s;ide, and dipping his Finger into it, &s;preads his Betel and Arek leaf with it. The Arek is a &s;mall Tree or Shrub, of a green Bark, and the Leaf is long and broader than a Willow. They are packt up to &s;ell into Parts that have them not, to chew with the Betel. The Betel-Nut is mo&s;t e&s;teem'd when it is young, and before it grows hard, and then they cut it only in two pieces with the green Husk or Shell on it. It is then exceeding juicy, and therefore makes them &s;pit much. It ta&s;tes rough in the Mouth, and dies the Lips red, and makes the Teeth black, but it pre&s;erves them, and clean&s;eth the Gums. It is al&s;o accounted very whol&s;om for the Stomach; but &s;ometimes it will cau&s;e great giddine&s;s in the Head of tho&s;e that are not us'd to chew it. But this is the effect only of the old Nut, for the young Nuts will not do it. I &s;peak of my own Experience.</P>
<P>This I&s;land produceth al&s;o Durians and Jacks, The Trees that bear the Durians, are as big as Ap|ple Trees, full of Boughs. The Rind is thick and rough; the Fruit is &s;o large that they grow only about the Bodies, or on the Limbs near the Body, like the Cacao. The Fruit is about the bigne&s;s of a large Pumkin, covered with a thick green rough Rind. When it is ripe, the Rind begins to turn yellow, but it is not fit to eat till it opens at the top. Then the Fruit in the in&s;ide is ripe, and &s;ends forth an excellent Scent. When the Rind is opened, the Fruit may be &s;plit into four quarters; each quarter hath &s;everal &s;mall Cells, that inclo&s;e a certain quantity of the Fruit, according to the bigne&s;s of the Cell, for &s;ome are larger than others. The large&s;t of the Fruit may be as big as a Pullets Egg: 'Tis as white as Milk, and as &s;oft as Cream, and the Ta&s;te very delicious to tho&s;e that are ac|cu&s;tomed to them; but tho&s;e who have not been
<PB N="320" REF="343">
u&s;ed to eat them, will di&s;like them at fir&s;t, becau&s;e they &s;mell like roa&s;ted Onions. This Fruit mu&s;t be eaten in its prime, (for there is no eating of it before it is ripe) and even then 'twill not keep a|bove a day or two before it putrifies, and turns black, or of a dark colour, and then it is not good. Within the Fruit there is a Stone as big as a &s;mall Bean, which hath a thin Shell over it. Tho&s;e that are minded to eat the Stones or Nuts, roa&s;t them, and then a thin Shell comes off, which inclo&s;es the Nut; and it eats like a Che&s;nut.</P>
<P>The Jack or Jaca is much like the Durian, both in bigne&s;s and &s;hape. The Trees that bear them al&s;o are much a like, and &s;o is their manner of the Fruits growing. But the in&s;ide is different; for the Fruit of the Durian is white, that of the Jack is yellow, and fuller of Stones. The Durian is mo&s;t e&s;teemed; yet the Jack is very plea&s;ant Fruit, and the Stones or Kernels are good roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>There are many other &s;orts of Grain, Roots and Fruits in this I&s;land, which to give a particular de|&s;cription of would fill up a large Volume.</P>
<P>In this I&s;land are al&s;o many &s;orts of Bea&s;ts, both wild and tame; as Hor&s;es, Bulls, and Cows, Buf|faloes, Goats, Wild Hogs, Deer, Monkies, Gua|no's, Lizards, Snakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I never &s;aw or heard of any Bea&s;ts of Prey here, as in many other places. The Hogs are ugly Creatures; they have all great Knobs growing over their Eyes, and there are mul|titudes of them in the Woods. They are com|monly very poor, yet &s;weet. Deer are here very plentiful in &s;ome places, where they are not di+&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Of the venemous kind of Creatures here are Scor|pions, who&s;e &s;ting is in their Tail; and Centapees, call'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> 40 Legs, both which are al&s;o com|mon in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and el&s;ewhere. The&s;e Centapees are 4 or 5 Inches long, as big as
<PB N="321" REF="344">
a Goo&s;e-Quill, but flatti&s;h; of a Dun or reddi&s;h co|lour on the Back, but Belly whiti&s;h, and full of Legs on each &s;ide the Belly. Their Sting or bite is more raging than the Scorpion. They lie in old Hou&s;es, and dry Timber. There are &s;everal &s;orts of Snakes, &s;ome very Poi&s;onous. There is another &s;ort of Creature like a Guano both in colour and &s;hape, but four times as big, who&s;e Tongue is like a &s;mall Harpoon, having two beards like the beards of a Fi&s;hook. They are &s;aid to be very venemous, but I know not their Names. I have &s;een them in other places al&s;o, as at <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> or the I&s;land <HI>Condore,</HI> and at <HI>Achin,</HI> and have been told that they are in the Bay of <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>The Fowls of this Country are Ducks and Hens: Other tame Fowl I have not &s;een nor heard of any. The wild Fowl are Pidgeons, Parrots, Parakits, Turtle Doves, and abundance of &s;mall Fowls. There are Bats as big as a Kite.</P>
<P>There are a great many Harbours, Creeks, and good Bays for Ships to ride in; and Rivers navi|gable for Canoas, Proes or Barks, which are all plentifully &s;tored with Fi&s;h of divers &s;orts, &s;o is al|&s;o the adjacent Sea. The chiefe&s;t Fi&s;h are Bonetas, Snooks, Cavally's, Bremes, Mullets, 10 Pounders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here are al&s;o plenty of Sea Turtle, and &s;mall Manatee, which are not near &s;o big as tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The bigge&s;t that I &s;aw would not weigh above 600 Pound, but the fle&s;h both of the Turtle and Manatee are very &s;weet.</P>
<P>The Weather at <HI>Mindanao</HI> is temperate enough as to heat, for all it lies &s;o near the Equator, and e&s;pecially on the borders near the Sea. There they commonly enjoy the breezes by day, and cooling Land Winds at Night. The Winds are Ea&s;terly one part of the Year, and We&s;terly the other. The Ea&s;terly Winds begin to blow in <HI>October,</HI> and it is the middle of <HI>November</HI> before they are &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="345">
The&s;e Winds bring fair Weather. The We&s;terly Winds begin to blow in <HI>May,</HI> but are not &s;ettled till a Month afterwards. The We&s;t Winds always bring Rain, Tornadoes, and very Tempe&s;tuous Weather. At the fir&s;t coming in of the&s;e Winds they blow but faintly; but then the Tornadoes ri&s;e one in a Day, &s;ometimes two. The&s;e are Thunder-&s;howers which commonly come again&s;t the Wind, bringing with them a contrary Wind to what did blow before. After the Tornadoes are over, the Wind &s;hifts about again, and the Sky be|comes clear, yet then in the Valleys and the &s;ides of the Mountains, there ri&s;eth a thick fog, which covers the Land. The Tornadoes continue thus for a Week or more; then they come thicker, two or three in a Day, bringing violent gu&s;ts of Wind, and terrible claps of Thunder. At la&s;t they come &s;o fa&s;t, that the Wind remains in the quarter from whence the&s;e Tornadoes do ri&s;e, which is out of the We&s;t, and there it &s;ettles till <HI>October</HI> or <HI>Novem|ber.</HI> When the&s;e We&s;tward Winds are thus &s;ettled, the Sky is all in mourning, being covered with black Clouds, pouring down exce&s;&s;ive Rains &s;ome times mixt with Thunder and Lightning, that no|thing can be more di&s;mal. The Winds raging to that degree, that the bigge&s;t Trees are torn up by the Roots, and the Rivers &s;well and overflow their Banks, and drown the low Land, carrying great Trees into the Sea. Thus it continues &s;ome|times a week together, before the Sun or Stars appear. The fierce&s;t of this Weather is in the latter end of <HI>July</HI> and in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> for then the Towns &s;eem to &s;tand in a great Pond, and they go from one Hou&s;e to another in Canoas. At this time the Water carries away all the filth and na&s;tine&s;s from under their Hou&s;es. Whil&s;t this tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts, the Weather is Cold and Chilly. In <HI>September</HI> the Wea|ther is more moderate, and the Winds are not &s;o
<PB N="323" REF="346">
fierce, nor the Rain &s;o violent. The Air thence|forward begins to be more clear and delight&s;ome; but then in the morning there are thick Fogs, con|tinuing till 10 or 11 a Clock before the Sun &s;hines out, e&s;pecially when it has rained in the Night. In <HI>October</HI> the Ea&s;terly Winds begin to blow again, and bring fair Weather till <HI>April.</HI> Thus much concern|ing the natural &s;tate of <HI>Mindanao.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis I&s;land is not &s;ubject to one Prince, nei|ther is the Language one and the &s;ame; but the People are much alike, in colour, &s;trength, and &s;tature. They are all or mo&s;t of them of
<PB N="325" REF="348">
one Religion, which is Mahometani&s;m, and their cu&s;toms and manner of living are alike. The <HI>Mindanao</HI> People, more particularly &s;o called, are the greate&s;t Nation in the I&s;land, and trading by Sea with other Nations, they are therefore the more civil. I &s;hall &s;ay but little of the re&s;t, being le&s;s known to me, but &s;o much as hath come to my knowledge, take as follows. There are be&s;ides the <HI>Mindanayans,</HI> the <HI>Hilanoones,</HI> (as they call them) or the <HI>Mountaneers,</HI> the <HI>Sologues</HI> and <HI>Al&s;oores.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hilanoones</HI> live in the heart of the Country: They have little or no commerce by Sea, yet they have Proe's that row with 12 or 14 Oars apiece. They enjoy the benefit of the Gold Mines; and with their Gold buy forreign Commodities of the <HI>Mindanao</HI> People. They have al&s;o plenty of Bees-Wax, which they exchange for other Commodi|ties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sologues</HI> inhabit the N. W. end of the I&s;land. They are the lea&s;t Nation of all; they Trade to <HI>Manila</HI> in Proes, and to &s;ome of the Neighbouring I&s;lands, but have no Commerce with the <HI>Mindanao</HI> People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Al&s;oores</HI> are the &s;ame with the <HI>Mindanayans,</HI> and were formerly under the &s;ubjection of the Sultan of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> but were divided between the Sultan's Children, and have of late had a Sultan of their own; but having by Marriage contracted an alliance with the Sultan of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> this has oc|ca&s;ioned that Prince to claim them again as his Subjects; and he made War with them a little after we went away, as I afterwards under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mindanayans</HI> properly &s;o called, are Men of mean &s;tatures; &s;mall Limbs, &s;traight Bodies, and little Heads. Their Faces are oval, their Fore|heads flat, with black &s;mall Eyes, &s;hort low No|&s;es, pretty large Mouths; their Lips thin and red, their Teeth black, yet very &s;ound, their Hair
<PB N="326" REF="349">
black and &s;traight, the colour of their Skin taw|ney, but inclining to a brighter yellow than &s;ome other <HI>Indians,</HI> e&s;pecially the Women. They have a Cu&s;tom to wear their Thumb-nails very long, e&s;pecially that on their left Thumb, for they do never cut it but &s;crape it often. They are indued with good natural Wits, are ingenious, nimble, and active, when they are minded; but generally very lazy and thievi&s;h, and will not work except forced by Hunger. This lazine&s;s is natural to mo&s;t <HI>Indi|ans;</HI> but the&s;e People's lazine&s;s &s;eems rather to pro|ceed not &s;o much from their natural Inclinations, as from the &s;everity of their Prince of whom they &s;tand in awe: For he dealing with them very ar|bitrarily, and taking from them what they get, this damps their Indu&s;try, &s;o they never &s;trive to have any thing but from Hand to Mouth. They are generally proud, and walk very &s;tately. They are civil enough to Strangers, and will ea&s;ily be acquainted with them, and entertain them with great freedom; but they are implacable to their Enemies, and very revengeful if they are injured, frequently poi&s;oning &s;ecretly tho&s;e that have af|fronted them.</P>
<P>They wear but few Cloaths; their Heads are circled with a &s;hort Turbat, fringed or laced at both ends; it goes once about the Head, and is tied in a knot, the laced ends hanging down. They wear Frocks and Breeches, but no Stockings nor Shooes.</P>
<P>The Women are fairer than the Men; and their Hair is black and long; which they tie in a knot, that hangs back in their Poles. They are more round vi&s;aged than the Men, and generally well featured; only their No&s;es are very &s;mall, and &s;o low between their Eyes, that in &s;ome of the Fe|male Children the ri&s;ing that &s;hould be between the Eyes is &s;carce di&s;cernable; neither is there any
<PB N="327" REF="350">
&s;en&s;ible ri&s;ing in their Foreheads. At a di&s;tance they appear very well; but being nigh, the&s;e Im|pediments are very obvious. They have very &s;mall Limbs. They wear but two Garments; a Frock, and a &s;ort of Petticoat; the Petticoat is only a piece of Cloth, &s;owed both ends together: but it is made two Foot too big for their Wa&s;tes, &s;o that they may wear either end uppermo&s;t: that part that comes up to their Wa&s;tes, becau&s;e it is &s;o much to big, they gather it in their Hands, and twi&s;t it till it &s;its clo&s;e to their Wa&s;tes, tucking in the twi&s;ted part between their Wa&s;te and the edge of the Petticoat, which keeps it clo&s;e. The Frock &s;its loo&s;e about them, and reaches down a little below the Wa&s;te. The Sleeves are a great deal longer than their Arms, and &s;o &s;mall at the end, that their Hands will &s;carce go through. Being on, the Sleeve &s;its in folds about the wri&s;t, wherein they take great pride.</P>
<P>The better &s;ort of People have their Garments made of long Cloth; but the ordinary &s;ort wear Cloth made of Plantain-tree, which they call <HI>Saggen,</HI> by which Name they call the Plantain. They have neither Stocking or Shooe, and the VVomen have very &s;mall Feet.</P>
<P>The VVomen are very de&s;irous of the company of Strangers, e&s;pecially of VVhite Men; and doubt|le&s;s would be very familiar, if the Cu&s;tom of the Country did not debar them from that freedom, which &s;eems coveted by them. Yet from the high|e&s;t to the lowe&s;t they are allowed liberty to con|ver&s;e with, or treat Strangers in the fight of their Husbands.</P>
<P>There is a kind of begging Cu&s;tom at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> that I have not met el&s;ewhere with in all my Tra|vels; and which I believe is owing to the little Trade they have; which is thus: VVhen Strangers arrive here, the <HI>Mindanao</HI> Men will come aboard,
<PB N="328" REF="351">
and invite them to their Hou&s;es, and inquire who has a <HI>Comrade,</HI> (which word I believe they have from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) or a <HI>Pagally,</HI> and who has not. A <HI>Comrade</HI> is a familiar Male-friend; a <HI>Pa|gally</HI> is an Innocent Platonick Friend of the other Sex. All Strangers are in a manner oblig'd to ac|cept of this Acquaintance and Familiarity, which mu&s;t be fir&s;t purcha&s;ed with a &s;mall Pre&s;ent, and afterwards confirmed with &s;ome Gift or other to continue the Acquaintance: and as often as the Stranger goes a&s;hore, he is welcome to his <HI>Comrade</HI> or <HI>Pagally</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where he may be entertained for his Money, to Eat, Drink, or Sleep; and com|plimented, as often as he comes a&s;hore, with To|bacco and Betel-Nut, which is all the Entertain|ment he mu&s;t expect <HI>gratis.</HI> The riche&s;t Mens Wives are allow'd the freedom to conver&s;e with her <HI>Pagally</HI> in publick, and may give or receive Pre&s;ents from him. Even the Sultans and the Generals Wives, who are always coopt up, will yet look out of their Cages when a Stranger pa&s;&s;eth by, and de|mand of him if he wants a <HI>Pagally:</HI> and to invite him to their Friend&s;hip, will &s;end a Pre&s;ent of To|bacco and Betel-nut to him by their Servants.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t City on this I&s;land is called by the &s;ame name of <HI>Mindanao.</HI> It is &s;eated on the South &s;ide of the I&s;land, in lat. 7 d. 20 m. N. on the banks of a &s;mall River, about two Mile from the Sea. The manner of building is &s;omewhat &s;trange: yet generally u&s;ed in this part of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> Their Hou&s;es are all built on Po&s;ts, about 14, 16, 18, or 20 Foot high. The&s;e Po&s;ts are bigger or le&s;s, ac|cording to the intended magnificence of the Super|&s;tructure. They have but one Floor, but many Par|titions or Rooms, and a Ladder or Stairs to go up out of the Streets. The Roof is large, and covered with Palmeto or Palm-leaves. So there is a clear pa&s;&s;age like a Piazza (but a filthy one) under the
<PB N="329" REF="352">
Hou&s;e. Some of the poorer People that keep Ducks or Hens, have a fence made round the Po&s;ts of their Hou&s;es, with a Door to go in and out; and this Under-room &s;erves for no other u&s;e. Some u&s;e this place for the common draught of their Hou&s;es, but building mo&s;tly clo&s;e by the River in all parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> they make the River receive all the filth of their Hou&s;e; and at the time of the Land-floods, all is wa&s;hed very clean.</P>
<P>The Sultan's Hou&s;e is much bigger than any of the re&s;t. It &s;tands on about 180 great Po&s;ts or Trees, a great deal higher than the common Building, with great broad Stairs made to go up. In the fir&s;t Room he hath about 20 Iron Guns, all Saker and Minion, placed on Field-Carriages. The General, and other great Men have &s;ome Guns al&s;o in their Hou&s;es. About 20 paces from the Sultan's Hou&s;e there is a &s;mall low Hou&s;e, built purpo&s;ely for the Reception of Amba&s;&s;adors or Merchant Strangers. This al&s;o &s;tands on Po&s;ts, but the Floor is not rai&s;ed above three or four Foot above the Ground, and is neatly Matted purpo&s;ely for the Sultan and his Council to &s;it on; for they u&s;e no Chairs, but &s;it cro&s;s-legg'd like Taylors on the Floor.</P>
<P>The common Food at <HI>Mindanao</HI> is Rice, or Sago, and a &s;mall Fi&s;h or two. The better &s;ort eat Buffa|lo, or Fowls ill dre&s;t, and abundance of Rice with it. They u&s;e no Spoons to eat their Rice, but every Man takes a handful out of the Platter, and by wetting his Hand in Water, that it may not &s;tick to his Hand, &s;queezes it into a lump, as hard as po&s;&s;ibly he can make it, and then crams it into his Mouth. They all &s;trive to make the&s;e lumps as big as their Mouths can receive them; and &s;eem to vie with each other, and glory in taking in the bigge&s;t lump; &s;o that &s;ometimes they almo&s;t choak them|&s;elves. They always wa&s;h after Meals, or if they touch any thing that is unclean; for which rea&s;on
<PB N="330" REF="353">
they &s;pend abundance of VVater in their Hou&s;es. This VVater, with the wa&s;hing of their Di&s;hes, and what other filth they make, they pour down near their Fire-place: for their Chambers are not boarded, but floored with &s;plit Bamboes, like Lathe, &s;o that the VVater pre&s;ently falls underneath their dwelling Rooms, where it breeds Maggots, and makes a pro|digious &s;tink. Be&s;ides this filthine&s;s, the &s;ick Peo|ple ea&s;e them&s;elves, and make VVater in their Cham|bers; there being a &s;mall hole made purpo&s;ely in the floor, to let it drop through. But healthy &s;ound People commonly ea&s;e them&s;elves, and make VVater in the River. For that rea&s;on you &s;hall always &s;ee abundance of People, of both Sexes in the River. from Morning till Night; &s;ome ea&s;ing them&s;elves, others wa&s;hing their bodies or Cloaths. If they come into the River purpo&s;ely to wa&s;h their Cloaths, they &s;trip and &s;tand naked till they have done; then put them on, and march out again: both Men and VVo|men take great delight in &s;wimming, and wa&s;hing them&s;elves, being bred to it from their Infancy. I do believe it is very whol&s;om to wa&s;h Mornings and Evenings in the&s;e hot Countries, at lea&s;t three or four Days in the VVeek: For I did u&s;e my &s;elf to it when I lived afterwards at <HI>Ben-cooly,</HI> and found it very refre&s;hing and comfortable. It is very good for tho&s;e that have Fluxes to wa&s;h and &s;tand in the River Mornings and Evenings. I &s;peak it experimen|tally; for I was brought very low with that di&s;tem|per at <HI>Achin;</HI> but by wa&s;hing con&s;tantly Mornings and Evenings I found great benefit, and was quickly cured by it.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Mindanao</HI> they &s;peak two Lan|guages indifferently; their own <HI>Mindanao</HI> Lan|guage, and the <HI>Malaya:</HI> but in other parts of the I&s;land they &s;peak only their proper Language, ha|ving little Commerce abroad. They have Schools, and in&s;truct the Children to Read and VVrite, and
<PB N="331" REF="354">
bring them up in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. There fore many of the words, e&s;pecially their Prayers, are in <HI>Arabick;</HI> and many of the words of civility the &s;ame as in <HI>Turkey;</HI> and e&s;pecially when they meet in the Morning, or take leave of each other, they expre&s;s them&s;elves in that Language.</P>
<P>Many of the old People, both Men and Women, can &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were formerly &s;ettled among them, and had &s;everal Forts on this I&s;land; and then they &s;ent two Friers to the City, to convert the Sultan of <HI>Mindanao</HI> and his People. At that time the&s;e People began to learn <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> incroached on them and endea|voured to bring them into &s;ubjection; and proba|bly before this time had brought them all under their yoak, if they them&s;elves had not been drawn off from this I&s;land to <HI>Manila,</HI> to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;s,</HI> who threatned to invade them there. When the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> were gone, the old Sultan of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> Fa|ther to the pre&s;ent, in who&s;e time it was, razed and demoli&s;hed their Forts, brought away their Guns, and &s;ent away the Friers; and &s;ince that time will not &s;uffer the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;ettle on the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>They are now mo&s;t afraid of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible how they have in&s;laved many of the Neigh|bouring I&s;lands. For that Rea&s;on they have a long time de&s;ired the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to &s;ettle among them, and have offered them any convenient Place to build a Fort in, as the General him&s;elf told us; giving this Rea&s;on, that they do not find the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o in|croaching as the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> are no le&s;s jealous of their admitting the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for they are &s;en&s;ible what detriment it would be to them if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould &s;ettle here.</P>
<P>There are but few Trade&s;men at the City of <HI>Mindanao.</HI> The chiefe&s;t Trades are Gold&s;miths, Black&s;miths, and Carpenters. There are but two or
<PB N="332" REF="355">
three Gold&s;miths; the&s;e will work in Gold or Silver, and make any thing that you de&s;ire: but they have no Shop furni&s;hed with Ware ready made for Sale. Here are &s;everal Black&s;miths who work very well, con&s;idering the Tools that they work with. Their Bellows are much different from ours. They are made of a wooden Cylinder, the trunk of a Tree, about three Foot long, bored hollow like a Pump, and &s;et upright on the ground, on which the Fire it &s;elf is made. Near the lower end there is a &s;mall hole, in the &s;ide of the Trunk next the Fire, made to re|ceive a Pipe, through which the wind is driven to the Fire by a great bunch of fine Feathers fa&s;tned to one end of the Stick, which clo&s;ing up the in&s;ide of the Cylinder, drives the Air out of the Cylinder through the Pipe: Two of the&s;e Trunks or Cy|linders are placed &s;o nigh together, that a Man &s;tanding between them may work them both at once alternately, one with each Hand. They have neither Vice nor Anvil, but a great hard Stone or a piece of an old Gun, to hammer upon: yet they will perform their work making both common Uten&s;ils and Iron-works about Ships to admiration. They work altogether with Charcoal. Every Man almo&s;t is a Carpenter, for they can work with the Ax and Adds. Their Ax is but &s;mall, and &s;o made that they can take it out of the Helve, and by turn|ing it make an Adds of it. They have no Saws; but when they make Plank, they &s;plit the Tree in two, and make a Plank of each part, plaining it with the Ax and Adds. This requires much pains, and takes up a great deal of time; but they work cheap, and the goodne&s;s of the Plank thus hewed, which hath its grain pre&s;erv'd entire, makes a|mends for their co&s;t and pains.</P>
<P>They build good and &s;erviceable Ships or Barks for the Sea, &s;ome for Trade, others for Plea&s;ure; and &s;ome Ships of War. Their trading Ve&s;&s;els they
<PB N="333" REF="356">
&s;end chiefly to <HI>Manila.</HI> Thither they tran&s;port Bees-wax, which, I think, is the only Commodity, be|&s;ides Gold that they vend there. The Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Mindanao</HI> get a great deal of Bees-wax them&s;elves: but the greate&s;t quantity they purcha&s;e is of the Mountaneers, from whom they al&s;o get the Gold which they &s;end to <HI>Manila;</HI> and with the&s;e they buy their Calicoes, Mu&s;lins, and <HI>China</HI> Silk. They &s;end &s;ometimes their Barks to <HI>Borneo</HI> and other I&s;lands; but what they tran&s;port thither, or import from thence, I know not. The <HI>Dutch</HI> come hither in Sloops from <HI>Ternate</HI> and <HI>Tidore,</HI> and buy Rice, Bees-wax, and Tobacco: for here is a great deal of Tobacco grows on this I&s;land, more than in any I&s;land or Country in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> that I know of, <HI>Manila</HI> only excepted. It is an excellent &s;ort of Tobacco; but the&s;e People have not the Art of managing this Trade to their be&s;t advantage, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have at <HI>Manila.</HI> I do believe the Seeds were fir&s;t brought hither from <HI>Manila</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and even thither, in all probability, from <HI>America:</HI> the difference between the <HI>Mindanao</HI> and <HI>Manila</HI> Tobacco is, that the <HI>Min|danao</HI> Tobacco is of a darker colour; and the Leaf larger and gro&s;&s;er than the <HI>Manila</HI> Tobacco, being propagated or planted in a fatter Soil. The <HI>Manila</HI> Tobacco is of a bright yellow colour, of an in|different &s;ize, not &s;trong, but plea&s;ant to Smoak. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Manila</HI> are very curious about this Tobacco, having a peculiar way of making it up nearly in the Leaf. For they take two little Sticks, each about a Foot long, and flat, and placing the Stalks of the Tobacco Leaves in a row, 40 or 50 of them between the two Sticks, they bind them hard together, &s;o that the Leaves hang dangling down. One of the&s;e bundles is &s;old for a Rial at Fort <HI>St. George:</HI> but you may have 10 or 12 pound of Tobacco at <HI>Mindanao</HI> for a Rial; and the Tobacco is
<PB N="334" REF="357">
as good, or rather better than the <HI>Manila</HI> Tobacco but they have not that vent for it as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mindanao</HI> People are much troubled with a &s;ort of Lepro&s;ie, the &s;ame as we ob&s;erved at <HI>Guam.</HI> This Di&s;temper runs with a dry Scurf all over their Bodies, and cau&s;eth great itching in tho&s;e that have it, making them frequently &s;cratch and &s;crub them|&s;elves, which rai&s;eth the outer skin in &s;mall whiti&s;h flakes, like the &s;cales of little Fi&s;h, when they are rai&s;ed on end with a Knife. This makes their skin extraordinary rough, and in &s;ome you &s;hall &s;ee broad white &s;pots in &s;everal parts of their Body. I judge &s;uch have had it, but are cured; for their skins were &s;mooth, and I did not perceive them to &s;crub them&s;elves: yet I have learnt from their own mouths that the&s;e &s;pots were from this Di&s;temper. Whether they u&s;e any means to cure them&s;elves, or whether it goes away of it &s;elf, I know not: but I did not perceive that they made any great matter of it, for they did never refrain any company for it; none of our People caught it of them, for we were afraid of it, and kept off. They are &s;ome|times troubled with the Small Pox, but their ordi|nary Di&s;tempers are Fevers, Agues, Fluxes, with great pains, and gripings in their Guts. The Coun|try affords a great many Drugs and Medicinal Herbs, who&s;e Virtues are not unknown to &s;ome of them that pretend to cure the Sick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mindanao</HI> Men have many Wives: but what Ceremonies are u&s;ed when they Marry I know not. There is commonly a great Fea&s;t made by the Bridegroom to entertain his Friends, and the mo&s;t part of the Night is &s;pent in Mirth.</P>
<P>The Sultan is ab&s;olute in his Power over all his Subjects. He is but a poor Prince; for as I men|tioned before, they have but little Trade, and therefore cannot be rich. If the Sultan under&s;tands
<PB N="335" REF="358">
that any Man has Money, if it be but 20 Dollars, which is a great matter among them, he will &s;end to borrow &s;o much Money, pretending urgent oc|ca&s;ions for it; and they dare not deny him. Some|times he will &s;end to &s;ell one thing or another that he hath to di&s;po&s;e of, to &s;uch whom he knows to have Money, and they mu&s;t buy it, and give him his price; and if afterwards he hath occa&s;ion for the &s;ame thing, he mu&s;t have it if he &s;ends for it. He is but a little Man, between 50 or 60 Years old, and by relation very good natured, but over-ruled by tho&s;e about him. He has a Queen, and keeps about 29 Women, or Wives more, in who&s;e com|pany he &s;pends mo&s;t of his time. He has one Daughter by his Sultane&s;s or Queen, and a great many Sons and Daughters by the re&s;t. The&s;e walk about the Streets, and would be always beg|ging things of us; but it is reported, that the young Prince&s;s is kept in a Room, and never &s;tirs out, and that &s;he did never &s;ee any Man but her Father and <HI>Raja Laut</HI> her Uncle, being then about Fourteen Years Old.</P>
<P>When the Sultan vi&s;its his Friends he is carried in a &s;mall Couch on four Mens &s;houlders, with eight or ten armed Men to guard him; but he never goes far this way; for the Country is very Woody, and they have but little Paths, which renders it the le&s;s commodious. When he takes his plea&s;ure by Wa|ter, he carries &s;ome of his Wives along with him. The Proes that are built for this purpo&s;e, are large enough to entertain 50 or 60 Per&s;ons or more. The Hull is neatly built, with a round Head and Stern, and over the Hull there is a &s;mall &s;light Hou&s;e built with Bamboes; the &s;ides are made up with &s;plit Bamboes, about four Foot high, with little Windows in them of the &s;ame, to open and &s;hut at their plea&s;ure. The roof is almo&s;t flat, neatly thatched with Palmeto Leaves. This Hou&s;e is di|vided
<PB N="336" REF="359">
into two or three &s;mall Partitions or Chambers, one particularly for him&s;elf. This is neatly Matted underneath, and round the &s;ides; and there is a Carpit and Pillows for him to &s;leep on. The &s;e|cond Room is for his Women, much like the for|mer. The third is for the Servants, who tend them with Tobacco and Betel-Nut; for they are always chewing or &s;moaking. The fore and after-parts of the Ve&s;&s;el are for the Marriners to &s;it and Row. Be|&s;ides this, they have Outlayers, &s;uch as tho&s;e I de|&s;cribed at <HI>Guam;</HI> only the Boats and Outlayers here are larger. The&s;e Boats are more round, like the Half-Moon almo&s;t; and the Bamboes or Out|layers that reach from the Boat are al&s;o crooked. Be&s;ides, the Boat is not flat on one &s;ide here, as at <HI>Guam;</HI> but hath a Belly and Outlayers on each &s;ide: and whereas at <HI>Guam</HI> there is a little Boat fa|&s;ten'd to the Outlayers, that lies in the Water; the Beams or Bamboes here are fa&s;ten'd traver&s;e|wi&s;e to the Outlayers on each &s;ide, and touch not the Water like Boats, but 1, 3 or 4 Foot above the Water, and &s;erve for the Barge Men to &s;it and Row and paddle on; the in&s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el, except on|ly ju&s;t afore and abaft, being taken up with the apartments for the Pa&s;&s;engers. There run a-cro&s;s the Outlayers two tire of Beams for the Padlers to &s;it on, on each &s;ide the Ve&s;&s;el. The lower tire of the&s;e Beams is not a bove a Foot from the Water: &s;o that upon any the lea&s;t reeling of the Ve&s;&s;el, the Beams are dipt in the Water, and the Men that &s;it are wet up to their Wa&s;te: their Feet &s;eldom e&s;ca|ping the Water. And thus as all our Ve&s;&s;els are Rowed from within, the&s;e are Paddled from with|out.</P>
<P>The Sultan hath a Brother called <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> a brave Man. He is the &s;econd Man in the Kingdom. All Strangers that come hither to Trade mu&s;t make their Addre&s;s to him, for all Sea Affairs belong to
<PB N="337" REF="360">
him. He Licenceth Strangers to Import or Export any Commodity, and 'tis by his Permi&s;&s;ion that the Natives them&s;elves are &s;uffered to Trade: Nay the very Fi&s;hermen mu&s;t ake a Permit from him: So that there is no Man can come into the River or go out but by his leave. He is two or three Years younger than the Sultan, and a little Man like him. He has eight Women, by &s;ome of whom he hath I&s;&s;ue. He hath only one Son, about twelve or fourteen Years old, who was Circumci&s;ed while we were there. His Elde&s;t Son died a little before we came hither, for whom he was &s;till in great heavi|ne&s;s. If he had lived a little longer he &s;hould have Married the Young Prince&s;s, but whether this &s;econd Son mu&s;t have her I know not, for I did never hear any Di&s;cour&s;e about it. <HI>Raja Laut</HI> is a very &s;harp Man; he &s;peaks and writes <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> which he learned in his Youth. He has by often conver&s;ing with Strangers, got a great &s;ight into the Cu&s;toms of other Nations, and by <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Books has &s;ome knowledge of <HI>Europe.</HI> He is General of the <HI>Min|danayans,</HI> and is accounted an expert Soldier and a very &s;tout Man; and the Women in their Dances, Sing many Songs in his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The Sultan of <HI>Mindanao</HI> &s;ometimes makes War with his Neighbours the <HI>Mountaneers</HI> or <HI>Alfoores.</HI> Their Weapons are Swords, Lances and &s;ome Hand-Cre&s;&s;ets. The Cre&s;&s;et is a &s;mall thing like a Baggonet, which they always wear in War or Peace, at Work or Play, from the greate&s;t of them to the poore&s;t, or the meane&s;t Per&s;ons. They do never meet each other &s;o as to have a pitcht Battle, but they build &s;mall Works or Forts of Timber, wherein they plant little Guns, and lie in &s;ight of each other 2 or 3 Months, skirmi&s;hing every Day in &s;mall Parties, and &s;ometimes &s;urprizing a Bre&s;t-work; and whatever &s;ide is like to be wor&s;ted, if they have no probability to e&s;cape by flight, they

<P>The Religion of the&s;e People is Mahometani&s;m, <HI>Friday</HI> is their Sabbath; but I did never &s;ee any difference that they make between this Day and any other Day, only the Sultan him&s;elf goes then to the Mo&s;que twice. <HI>Raja Laut</HI> never goes to the Mo&s;que, but Prays at certain Hours, Eight or Ten times in a Day; where ever he is, he is very punctual to his Canonical Hours, and if he be aboard will go a&s;hore, on purpo&s;e to Pray. For no Bu&s;ine&s;s nor Company hinders him from this Duty. Whether he is at home or abroad, in a Hou&s;e or in the Field, he leaves all his Company, and goes about 100 Yards off, and there kneels down to his Devotion. He fir&s;t ki&s;&s;es the Ground, then prays aloud, and divers times in his Prayers he ki&s;&s;es the Ground, and does the &s;ame when he leaves off. His Servants, and his Wives and Children talk and &s;ing, or play how they plea&s;e all the time, but him&s;elf is very &s;erious. The meaner &s;ort of People have little De|votion: I did never &s;ee any of them at their Pray|ers, or go into a Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>In the Sultan's Mo&s;que there is a great Drum with but one Head called a <HI>Gong;</HI> which is in&s;tead of a Clock. This <HI>Gong</HI> is beaten at 12 a Clock, at 3, 6, and 9; a Man being appointed for that Ser|vice. He has a Stick as big as a Man's Arm, with a great knob at the end, bigger than a Man's Fi&s;t, made with Cotton, bound fa&s;t with &s;mall Cords: with this he &s;trikes the <HI>Gong</HI> as hard as he can, about 20 &s;trokes; beginning to &s;trike lei&s;urely the fir&s;t 5 or 6 &s;trokes; then he &s;trikes fa&s;ter, and at la&s;t &s;trikes as fa&s;t as he can; and then he &s;trikes again &s;lower and &s;lower &s;o many more &s;trokes: thus he ri&s;es and falls three times, and then leaves off till three Hours after. This is done Night and Day.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="364">
They circumci&s;e the Males at 11 or 12 Years of Age, or older; and many are circumci&s;ed at once. This Ceremony is performed with a great deal of Solemnity. There had been no Circumci&s;ion for &s;ome Years before our being here; and then there was one for <HI>Raja Laut</HI>'s Son. They chu&s;e to have a general Circumci&s;ion when the Sultan, or Ge|neral, or &s;ome other great Per&s;on hath a Son fit to be Circumci&s;ed; for with him a great many more are Circumci&s;ed. There is notice given about 8 or 10 Days before for all Men to appear in Arms, and great preparation is made again&s;t the &s;olemn Day. In the Morning before the Boys are Circum|ci&s;ed, Pre&s;ents are &s;ent to the Father of the Child, that keeps the Fea&s;t; which, as I &s;aid before, is either the Sultan, or &s;ome great Per&s;on: and about 10 or 11 a Clock the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Prie&s;t does his Of|fice. He takes hold of the fore-skin with two Sticks, and with a pair of Sci&s;&s;ors &s;nips it off. After this mo&s;t of the Men, both in City and Country being in Arms before the Hou&s;e, begin to act as if they were ingaged with an Enemy, having &s;uch Arms as I de&s;cribed. Only one acts at a time, the re&s;t make a great Ring of 2 or 300 Yards round about him. He that is to exerci&s;e comes into the Ring with a great &s;hriek or two, and a horrid look; then he fetches two or three large &s;tately &s;trides, and falls to work. He holds his broad Sword in one Hand, and his Lance in the other, and traver&s;es his Ground, leap|ing from one &s;ide of the Ring to the other; and in a menacing po&s;ture and look, bids defiance to the Enemy, whom his fancy frames to him; for there is nothing but Air to oppo&s;e him. Then he &s;tamps and &s;hakes his Head, and grinning with his Teeth makes many ruful Faces. Then he throws his Lance, and nimbly &s;natches out his Cre&s;&s;et, with which he hacks and hews the Air like a Mad-man, often &s;hrieking At la&s;t, being almo&s;t tired with
<PB N="340" REF="365">
motion, he flies to the middle of the Ring, where he &s;eems to have his Enemy at his Mercy, and with two or three blows cuts on the Ground as if he was cutting off his Enemy's Head. By this time he is all of a Sweat, and withdraws triumphantly out of the Ring, and pre&s;ently another enters with the like &s;hrieks and ge&s;ture. Thus they continue com|bating their imaginary Enemy all the re&s;t of the Day; towards the conclu&s;ion of which the riche&s;t Men act, and at la&s;t the General, and then the Sultan concludes this Ceremony: He and the Ge|neral with &s;ome other great Men, are in Armor, but the re&s;t have none. After this the Sultan re|turns home, accompanied with abundance of Peo|ple who wait on him there till they are di&s;mi&s;t. But at the time when we were there, there was an after game to be played; for the General's Son being then Circumci&s;ed, the Sultan intended to give him a &s;econd vi&s;it in the Night, &s;o they all waited to attend him thither. The General al&s;o pro|vided to meet him in the be&s;t manner, and there|fore de&s;ired Captain <HI>Swan</HI> with his Men to attend him. Accordingly Captain <HI>Swan</HI> ordered us to get our Guns, and wait at the General's Hou&s;e till fur|ther Orders. So about 40 of us waited till Eight a Clock in the Evening: When the General with Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and about 1000 Men, went to meet the Sultan, with abundance of Torches that made it as light as Day. The manner of the march was thus. Fir&s;t of all there was a Pageant, and upon it two dancing Women gorgeou&s;ly apparelled, with Co|ronets on their Heads, full of gli&s;tering Spangles, and Pendants of the &s;ame, hanging down over their Brea&s;t and Shoulders. The&s;e are Women bred up purpo&s;ely for dancing: Their Feet and Legs are but little imployed, except &s;ometimes to turn round very gently; but their Hands, Arms, Head and Body, are in continual motion, e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="341" REF="366">
their Arms, which they turn and twi&s;t &s;o &s;trangely, that you would think them to be made without Bones. Be&s;ides the two dancing Women, there were two old Women in the Pageant, hold|ing each a lighted Torch in their Hands, clo&s;e by the two dancing Women, by which light the glit|tering Spangles appeared very gloriou&s;ly. This Pageant was carried by &s;ix lu&s;ty Men: Then came &s;ix or &s;even Torches, lighting the General and Cap|tain <HI>Swan,</HI> who marched &s;ide by &s;ide next, and we that attended Captain <HI>Swan</HI> followed clo&s;e after, marching in order &s;ix and &s;ix abre&s;t, with each Man his Gun on his Shoulder, and Torches on each &s;ide. After us came twelve of the General's Men with old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Match-locks, marching four in a row. After them about forty Lances, and behind them as many with great Swords, marching all in order. After them came abundance only with Cre&s;&s;ers by their fides, who marched up clo&s;e without any order. When we came near the Sultan's Hou&s;e, the Sultan and his Men met us, and we wheel'd off to let them pa&s;s. The Sultan had three Pageants went before him: In the fir&s;t Pageant were four of his Sons, who were about 10 or 11 Years old. They had gotten abundance of &s;mall Stones, which they rogui&s;hly threw about on the Peoples Heads. In the next were four young Maidens, Nieces to the Sultan, being his Si&s;ters Daughters; and in the 3d, there were three of the Sultan's Children, not above &s;ix Years old. The Sultan him&s;elf followed next, being carried in his Couch, which was not like your <HI>Indian Palankins,</HI> but open, and very little and ordinary. A multitude of People came after, with|out any order: but as &s;oon as he was pa&s;t by, the General, and Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and all our Men, clo|&s;ed in ju&s;t behind the Sultan, and &s;o all marched together to the General's Hou&s;e. We came thither between 10 and 11 a Clock, where the bigge&s;t part
<PB N="342" REF="367">
of the Company were immediately di&s;mi&s;t; but the Sultan and his Children, and his Nieces, and &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Quality, entred the General's Hou&s;e. They were met at the head of the Stairs by the General's Women, who with a great deal of Re&s;pect conducted them into the Hou&s;e. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and we that were with him followed after. It was not long before the General cau&s;ed his dancing Women to enter the Room, and divert the Company with that pa&s;time. I had forgot to tell you that they have none but vocal Mu&s;ick here, by what I could learn, except only a row of a kind of Bells without Clappers, 16 in number, and their weight increa&s;ing gradually from about three to ten pound weight. The&s;e were &s;et in a row on a Table in the General's Hou&s;e, where for &s;even or eightDays together before the Circumci&s;ion Day, they were &s;truck each with a little Stick, for the bigge&s;t part of the Day making a great noi&s;e, and they cea&s;ed that Morning. So the&s;e dancing Women &s;ung them|&s;elves, and danced to their own Mu&s;ick. After this the General's Women, and the Sultan's Sons, and his Nieces danced. Two of the Sultan's Nieces were about 18 or 19 Years Old, the other two were three or four Years Younger. The&s;e Young Ladies were very richly dre&s;t, with loo&s;e Garments of Silk, and &s;mall Coronets on their Heads. They were much fairer than any Women that I did ever &s;ee there, and very well featured; and their No&s;es, tho' but &s;mall, yet higher than the other Womens, and very well proportioned. When the Ladies had very well diverted them&s;elves and the Company with dancing, the General cau&s;ed us to fire &s;ome Sky-rockets, that were made by his and Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Order, purpo&s;ely for this Nights Solemnity; and after that the Sultan and his retinue went a|way with a few Attendants, and we all broke up, and thus ended this Days Solemnity: but the Boys

being &s;ore with their Amputation, went &s;tradding for a fortnight after.</P>
<P>They are not, as I &s;aid before, very curious, or &s;trict in ob&s;erving any Days, or Times of particular Devotions, except it be <HI>Ramdam</HI> time, as we call it. The <HI>Ramdam</HI> time was then in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> as I take it, for it was &s;hortly after our arrival here. In this time they Fa&s;t all Day and about &s;even a Clock in the Evening, they &s;pend near an Hour in Prayer. Towards the latter end of their Prayer, they loudly invoke their Prophet, for about a quarter of an Hour, both old and young bawling out very &s;trangely, as if they intended to fright him out of his &s;leepine&s;s or neglect of them. After their Prayer is ended, they &s;pend &s;ome time in Fea&s;ting before they take their repo&s;e. Thus they do every Day for a whole Month at lea&s;t; for &s;ometimes 'tis two or three Days longer before the <HI>Ramdam</HI> ends: For it begins at the New Moon, and la&s;ts till they &s;ee the next New Moon, which &s;ometimes in thick hazy Wea|ther is not till three or four Days after the Change, as it happen'd while I was at <HI>Achin,</HI> where they continued the <HI>Ramdam</HI> till the New Moon's ap|pearance. The next Day after they have &s;een the New Moon, the Guns are all di&s;charged about Noon, and then the time ends.</P>
<P>A main part of their Religion con&s;i&s;ts in wa&s;hing often, to keep them&s;elves from being defiled; or after they are defiled to clean&s;e them&s;elves again. They al&s;o take great care to keep them&s;elves from being polluted, by ta&s;ting or touching any thing that is accounted Unclean; therefore Swines Fle&s;h is very abominable to them; nay, any one that hath ei|ther ta&s;ted of Swines fle&s;h, or touched tho&s;e Creatures, is not permitted to come into their Hou&s;es in many Days after, and there is nothing will &s;care them more than a Swine. Yet there are wild Hogs in the I&s;lands, and tho&s;e &s;o plentiful, that they will
<PB N="344" REF="369">
come in Troops out of the Woods in the Night in|to the very City, and come under their Hou&s;es, to romage up and down the Filth that they find there. The Natives therefore would even de&s;ire us to lie in wait for the Hogs, to de&s;troy them, which we did frequently, by &s;hooting them and carrying them pre&s;ently on board, but were prohi|bited their Hou&s;es afterwards.</P>
<P>And now I am on this Subject, I cannot omit a Story concerning the General. He once de&s;ired to have a pair of Shoes made after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fa|&s;hion, tho' he did very &s;eldom wear any: So one our Men made him a Pair, which the General liked very well. Afterwards &s;ome Body told him, That the Thread wherewith the Shoes were &s;owed, were pointed with Hogs-bri&s;tles. This put him into a great Pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o he &s;ent the Shoes to the Man that made them, and &s;ent him withal more Leather to make another Pair, with Threads pointed with &s;ome other Hair, which was immediately done, and then he was well plea&s;ed.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving in the two la&s;t Chapters given &s;ome Account of the Natural, Civil, and Religious State of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> I &s;hall now go on with the pro|&s;ecution of our Affairs during our &s;tay there.</P>
<P>'Twas in a Bay on the N. Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land that we came to an Anchor, as hath been &s;aid. We lay in this Bay but one Night, and part of the next Day. Yet there we got Speech with &s;ome of the Natives, who by &s;igns made us to under&s;tand, that the City <HI>Mindanao</HI> was on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land. We endeavoured to per&s;uade one of them, to go with us to be our Pilot, but he would not: Therefore in the Afternoon we loo&s;ed from hence, &s;teering again to the South Ea&s;t, having the Wind at S. W. When we came to the S. E. end of the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao,</HI> we &s;aw two &s;mall I&s;lands about three Leagues di&s;tant from it. We might have pa&s;&s;ed between them and the main I&s;land, as we learnt &s;ince; but not knowing them, nor what dangers we might encounter there, we cho&s;e rather to Sail to the Ea&s;tward of them. But meeting very &s;trong We&s;terly Winds, we got nothing forward in many
<PB N="347" REF="372">
Days. In this time we fir&s;t &s;aw the I&s;lands <HI>Mean|gis,</HI> which are about 16 Leagues di&s;tant from the <HI>Mindanao,</HI> bearing S. E. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more of them hereafter.</P>
<P>The 4th Day of <HI>July</HI> we got into a deep Bay, four Leagues N. W. from the two &s;mall I&s;lands before mentioned. But the Night before, in a violent Tornado, our Bark being unable to beat any long|er, bore away, which put us in &s;ome pain for fear &s;he was over&s;et, as we had like to have been our &s;elves. We anchored on the South We&s;t &s;ide of the Bay, in fifteen fathom Water, about a Cables length from the &s;hore. Here we were forced to &s;helter our &s;elves from the violence of the Weather, which was &s;o boi&s;terous with Rains, and Tornadoes, and a &s;trong We&s;terly Wind, that we were very glad to find this place to Anchor in, being the only &s;helter on this &s;ide from the We&s;t Winds.</P>
<P>This Bay is not above two Mile wide at the Mouth, but farther in it is three Leagues wide, and &s;even fathom deep, running in N. N. W. There is a good depth of Water about four or five Leagues in, but Rocky foul Ground for about two Leagues in, from the mouth on both &s;ides of the Bay, except only in that place where we lay. About three Lea|gues in from the mouth, on the Ea&s;tem &s;ide, there are fair &s;andy Bays, and very good anchoring in four, five, and &s;ix fathom. The Land on the Ea&s;t &s;ide is high, Mountainous, and Woody, yet very well wa|tered with &s;mall Brooks, and there is one River large enough for Canoes to enter. On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Bay, the Land is of a mean heighth with a large Savannah, bordering on the Sea, and &s;tretching from the mouth of the Bay, a great way to the We&s;tward.</P>
<P>This Savannah abounds with long Gra&s;s, and it is plentifully &s;tock'd with Deer. The adjacent Woods are a covert for them in the heat of the Day: but
<PB N="348" REF="373">
Mornings and Evenings they feed in the open Plains, as thick as in our Parks in <HI>England.</HI> I never &s;aw any where &s;uch plenty of wild Deer, tho' I have met with them in &s;everal parts of <HI>America,</HI> both in the North and South Seas.</P>
<P>The Deer live here pretty peaceably and unmo|le&s;ted; for there are no Inhabitants on that &s;ide of the Bay. We vi&s;ited this Savannah every Morning, and killed as many Deer as we plea&s;ed, &s;ometimes 16 or 18 in a Day; and we did eat nothing but Veni&s;on all the time we &s;taid here.</P>
<P>We &s;aw a great many Plantations by the &s;ides of the Mountains, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Bay, and we went to one of them, in hopes to learn of the Inhabitants whereabouts the City was, that we might not over-&s;ail it in the Night: but they fled from us.</P>
<P>We lay here till the 12th Day before the Winds abated of their fury, and then we &s;ailed from hence, directing our cour&s;e to the We&s;tward. In the Morning we had a Land Wind at North. At 11 a Clock the Sea breeze came at We&s;t, ju&s;t in our Teeth, but it being fair Weather, we kept on our way, turning and taking the advantage of the Land breezes by Night, and the Sea breezes by Day.</P>
<P>Being now pa&s;t the S. E part of the I&s;land, we coa&s;ted down on the South &s;ide, and we &s;aw a|bundance of Canoas a fi&s;hing, and now and then a &s;mall Village. Neither were the&s;e Inhabitants a|fraid of us (as the former) but came aboard; yet we could not under&s;tand them, nor they us, but by &s;igns: and when we mentioned the word <HI>Mindanao,</HI> they would point towards it.</P>
<P>The 18th Day of <HI>July</HI> we arrived before the Ri|ver of <HI>Mindanao;</HI> the mouth of which lies in lat. 6 d. 22 m. N. and is laid in 231 d. 12 m. Longi|tude We&s;t, from the <HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> We anchor|ed right again&s;t the River in 15 fathom Water, clear
<PB N="349" REF="374">
hard Sand; about 2 Miles from the &s;hore, and 3 or 4 Miles from a &s;mall I&s;land, that lay without us to the Southward. VVe fired 7 or 9 Guns, I remem|ber not well which, and were an&s;wered again with 3 from the &s;hore; for which we gave one again. Immediately after our coming to an Anchor <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> and one of the Sultan's Sons came off in a Canoa, being rowed with 10 Oars, and demanded in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> what we were? and from whence we came? Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> (he who was taken Pri&s;oner at <HI>Leon</HI> in <HI>Mexico</HI>) an&s;wered in the &s;ame Language, that we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that we had been a great while out of <HI>England.</HI> They told us that we were welcome, and asked us a great many que&s;tions a|bout <HI>England;</HI> e&s;pecially concerning our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Merchants; and whether we were &s;ent by them to &s;ettle a Factory here? Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> told them that we came hither only to buy Provi&s;ion. They &s;eemed a little di&s;contented when they under&s;tood that we were not come to &s;ettle among them: for they had heard of our arrival on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land a great while before, and entertained hopes that we were &s;ent purpo&s;ely out of <HI>England</HI> hither to &s;ettle a Trade with them; which it &s;hould &s;eem they are very de&s;irous of. For Capt. <HI>Goodlud</HI> had been here not long before to treat with them about it; and when he went away told them (as they &s;aid) that in a &s;hort time they might expect an Amba&s;&s;adour from <HI>England,</HI> to make a full bargain with them.</P>
<P>Indeed upon mature thoughts, I &s;hould think we could not have done better, than to have com|plied with the de&s;ire they &s;eemed to have of our &s;ettling here; and to have taken up our quarters among them. For as thereby we might better have con&s;ulted our own profit and &s;atisfaction, than by the other loo&s;e roving way of life; &s;o it might probably have proved of publick benefit to our Nation, and been a means of introducing an
<PB N="350" REF="375">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlement and Trade, not only here, but through &s;everal of the Spice-I&s;lands, which lye in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P>For the I&s;lands <HI>Meangis,</HI> which I mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter, lye within twenty Leagues of <HI>Mindanao.</HI> The&s;e are three &s;malls I&s;lands that abound with Gold and Cloves, If I may credit my Author Prince <HI>Jeoly,</HI> who was born on one of them, and was at that time a Slave in the City of <HI>Mindanao.</HI> He might have been purcha&s;ed by us of his Ma&s;ter for a &s;mall matter, as he was aftewards by Mr. <HI>Moody,</HI> (who came hither to trade, and laded a Ship with Clove-Bark) and by tran&s;porting him home to his own Country, we might have gotten a Trade there. But of Prince <HI>Jeoly</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter. The&s;e I&s;lands are as yet pro|bably unknown to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who as I &s;aid before, indeavour to ingro&s;s all the Spice into their own Hands.</P>
<P>There was another opportunity offered us here of &s;ettling on another Spice-I&s;land that was very well inhabited: for the Inhabitants fearing the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and under&s;tanding that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;et|tling at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> their Sultan &s;ent his Nephew to <HI>Mindanao</HI> while we were there to invite us thither: Captain <HI>Swan</HI> conferr'd with him about it divers times, and I do believe he had &s;ome Inclination to accept the offer; and I am &s;ure mo&s;t of the Men were for it: but this never came to a head, for want of a true under&s;tanding between Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Men, as may be declared hereafter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the benefit which might accrue from this Trade with <HI>Meangis,</HI> and other the Spice I&s;lands, the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands them&s;elves, by a little care and indu&s;try, might have afforded us a very bene|ficial Trade, and all the&s;e Trades might have been managed from <HI>Mindanao,</HI> by &s;ettling there fir&s;t. For that I&s;land lyeth very convenient for Trading
<PB N="351" REF="376">
either to the Spice-I&s;lands, or to the re&s;t of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands: &s;ince as its Soil is much of the &s;ame nature with either of them, &s;o it lies as it were in the Center of the Gold and Spice Trade in the&s;e parts; the I&s;lands North of <HI>Mindanao</HI> abounding mo&s;t in Gold, and tho&s;e South of <HI>Meangis</HI> in Spice.</P>
<P>As the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao</HI> lies very convenient for Trade, &s;o con&s;idering its di&s;tance, the way thi|ther may not be over-long and tire&s;ome. The Cour&s;e that I would choo&s;e &s;hould be to &s;et out of <HI>England</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and to pa&s;s round <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> and &s;o &s;tretching over to|wards <HI>New Holland,</HI> coa&s;t it along that Shore till I came near to <HI>Mindanao;</HI> or fir&s;t I would coa&s;t down near the <HI>American</HI> Shore, as far as I found convenient, and then direct my Cour&s;e accordingly for the I&s;land. By this I &s;hould avoid coming near any of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements, and he &s;ure to meet always with a con&s;tant brisk Ea&s;terly Trade Wind, after I was once pa&s;t <HI>Terra del Fuego.</HI> Whereas in pa&s;&s;ing about the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> after you are &s;hot over the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Ocean, and are come to the I&s;lands, you mu&s;t pa&s;s through the Streights of <HI>Malacca</HI> or <HI>Sandy,</HI> or el&s;e &s;ome other Streights Ea&s;t from <HI>Java,</HI> where you will be &s;ure to meet with Country-winds, go on which &s;ide of the Equator you plea&s;e; and this would require ordinarily 7 or 8 Months for the Voyage, but the other I &s;hould hope to perform in 6 or 7 at mo&s;t. In your return from thence al&s;o you mu&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;ame Rule as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do in going from <HI>Manila</HI> to <HI>Acapulco;</HI> only as they run towards the North-Pole for variable Winds, &s;o you mu&s;t run to the South|ward, till you meet with a Wind that will carry you over to <HI>Terra del Fuego.</HI> There are places e|nough to touch at for Refre&s;hment, either going or coming. You may touch going thither on ei|ther
<PB N="352" REF="377">
&s;ide of <HI>Terra Patagonica,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e, at the <HI>Gallapagoes I&s;lands,</HI> where there is Refre&s;hment enough; and returning you may probably touch &s;omewhere on <HI>New Holland,</HI> and &s;o make &s;ome pro|fitable di&s;covery in the&s;e Places without going out of your way. And to &s;peak my Thoughts freely, I believe 'tis owing to the neglect of this ea&s;ie way that all that va&s;t Tract of <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis</HI> which bounds the <HI>South Sea</HI> is yet undi&s;covered: tho&s;e that cro&s;s that Sea &s;eeming to de&s;ign &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s on the <HI>Peruvian</HI> or <HI>Mexican</HI> Coa&s;t, and &s;o leaving that at a di&s;tance. To confirm which, I &s;hall add what Captain <HI>Davis</HI> told me lately, That after his Departure from us at the Haven of <HI>Ria Lexa</HI> (as is mentioned in the 8th Chap.) he went after &s;eve|ral Traver&s;es, to the <HI>Gallapagoes,</HI> and that &s;tanding thence Southward for Wind, to bring him about <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> in the Lat. of 27 South, about 500 leagues from <HI>Copayapo,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coili,</HI> he &s;aw a &s;mall &s;andy I&s;land ju&s;t by him; and that they &s;aw to the We&s;tward of it a long Tract of pretty high Land, tending away toward the North We&s;t out of &s;ight. This might probably be the Coa&s;t of <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis Incognita.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Mindanao;</HI> as to the Capacity we were then in, of &s;ettling our &s;elves at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> al|though we were not &s;ent out of any &s;uch de&s;ign of &s;ettling, yet we were as well provided, or better, con&s;idering all Circum&s;tances, than if we had. For there was &s;carce any u&s;eful Trade, but &s;ome or other of us under&s;tood it. We had Sawyers, Car|penters, Joyners, Brickmakers, Bricklayers, Shoe|makers, Taylors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we only wanted a good Smith for great Work; which we might have had at <HI>Mindanao.</HI> We were very well provided with Iron, Lead, and all &s;orts of Tools, as Saws, Axes, Hammers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We had Powder and Shot enough, and very good &s;mall Arms. If we had de&s;igned to
<PB N="353" REF="378">
build a Fort, we could have &s;pared 8 or 10 Guns out of our Ship, and Men enough to have ma|naged it, and any Affair of Trade be&s;ide. We had al&s;o a great Advantage above raw Men that are &s;ent out of <HI>England</HI> into the&s;e places, who proceed u&s;u|ally too cautiou&s;ly, coldly and formally, to com|pa&s;s any con&s;iderable De&s;ign, which Experience better teaches than any Rules what&s;oever; be&s;ides the danger of their Lives in &s;o great and &s;udden a change of Air: whereas we were all inured to hot Climates, hardened by many Fatigues, and, in general, daring Men, and &s;uch as would not be ea&s;ily baffled. To add one thing more, our Men were almo&s;t tired, and began to de&s;ire a <HI>quietus e&s;t;</HI> and therefore they would gladly have &s;eated them|&s;elves any where. We had a good Ship too, and enough of us (be&s;ide what might have been &s;pared to manage our new Settlement) to bring the News with the Effects to the Owners in <HI>England:</HI> for Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had already 5000 <HI>l.</HI> in Gold, which he and his Merchants received for Goods &s;old mo&s;t|ly to Captain <HI>Harris</HI> and his Men: which if he had laid but part of it out in Spice, as probably he might have done, would have &s;atisfy'd the Merchants to their Hearts content. So much by way of digre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore with our fir&s;t Reception at <HI>Mindanao, Raja Laut</HI> and his Nephew &s;at &s;till in their Canoa, and would not come aboard us; becau&s;e, as they &s;aid, they had no Orders for it from the Sultan. After about half an Hour's Di&s;cour&s;e, they took their leaves, fir&s;t inviting Captain <HI>Swan</HI> a&s;hore, and pro|mi&s;ing him to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in getting Provi&s;ion; which they &s;aid at pre&s;ent was &s;carce, but in three or four Month's time the Rice would be gathered in, and then he might have as much as he plea&s;ed: and that in the mean time he might &s;ecure his Ship in &s;ome convenient place, for fear of the We&s;terly

winds, which they &s;aid would be very violent at the latter end of this Month, and all the next, as we found them.</P>
<P>We did not know the quality of the&s;e two Per|&s;ons till after they were gone; el&s;e we &s;hould have fir'd &s;ome Guns at their departure: When they were gone, a certain Officer under the Sultan came aboard, and mea&s;ured our Ship. A cu&s;tom deri|ved from the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who always mea&s;ure the length and breadth, and the depth of the Hold of all Ships that come to load there; by which means they know how much each Ship will carry. But for what rea&s;on this Cu&s;tom is u&s;ed either by the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Mindanao</HI> Men, I could never learn; un|le&s;s the <HI>Mindanaians</HI> de&s;ign by this means to im|prove their skill in Shipping, again&s;t they have a Trade.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> con&s;idering that the Sea&s;on of the Year would oblige us to &s;pend &s;ome time at this I&s;land, thought it convenient to make what inte|re&s;t he could with the Sultan; who might after|wards either ob&s;truct, or advance his de&s;igns. He therefore immediately provided a Pre&s;ent to &s;end a|&s;hore to the Sultan, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 Yards of Scarlet Cloth, 3 Yards of broad Gold Lace, a Turki&s;h Scimiter and a Pair of Pi&s;tols: and to <HI>Raja Laut</HI> he &s;ent 3 Yards of Scarlet Cloth, and 3 Yards of Silver Lace. This Pre&s;ent was carried by Mr. <HI>Henry More</HI> in the Even|ing. He was fir&s;t conducted to <HI>Raja Laut</HI>'s Hou&s;e; where he remained till report thereof was made to the Sultan, who immediately gave order for all things to be made ready to receive him.</P>
<P>About Nine a Clock at Night, a Me&s;&s;enger came from the Sultan to bring the Pre&s;ent away. Then Mr. <HI>More</HI> was conducted all the way with Torches and armed Men, till be came to the Hou&s;e where the Sultan was. The Sultan with eight or ten Men of his Council were &s;eated on Carpets, waiting
<PB N="355" REF="382">
his coming. The Pre&s;ent that Mr. <HI>More</HI> brought was laid down before them, and was very kindly accepted by the Sultan, who cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>More</HI> to &s;it down by them, and asked a great many que&s;tions of him. The di&s;cour&s;e was in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> by an In|terpreter. This Conference la&s;ted about an Hour, and then he was di&s;mi&s;t, and returned again to <HI>Raja Laut</HI>'s Hou&s;e. There was a Supper provided for him, and the Boats Crew; after which he re|turned aboard.</P>
<P>The next Day the Sultan &s;ent for Capt. <HI>Swan:</HI> He immediately went a&s;hore with a Flag flying in the Boats Head, and two Trumpets &s;ounding all the way. When he came a&s;hore, he was met at his Landing by two principal Officers, guarded along with Soldiers, and abundance of People gazing to &s;ee him. The Sultan waited for him in his Cham|ber of Audience, where Captain <HI>Swan</HI> was treated with Tobacco and Betel, which was all his Enter|tainment.</P>
<P>The Sultan &s;ent for two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Letters for Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> to read, purpo&s;ely to let him know, that our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Merchants did de&s;ign to &s;ettle here, and that they had already &s;ent a Ship hi|ther. One of the&s;e Letters was &s;ent to the Sultan from <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Merchants. The chiefe&s;t things contained in it, as I remember, for I &s;aw it afterwards in the Secretaries Hand, who was very proud to &s;hew it to us, was to de&s;ire &s;ome priviledges, in order to the building of a Fort there. This Letter was written in a very fair Hand; and between each Line, there was a Gold Line drawn. The other Letter was left by Captain <HI>Goodlud,</HI> directed to any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men who &s;hould happen to come thither. This related wholly to Trade, giving an account, at what rate he had agreed with them for Goods of the I&s;land, and how <HI>European</HI> Goods &s;hould be &s;old to them;
<PB N="256" REF="383">
with an account of their Weight and Mea&s;ures, and their difference from ours.</P>
<P>The rate agreed on for <HI>Mindanao</HI> Gold, was 14 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dollars, (which is a current Coin all over <HI>India</HI>) the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ounce, and 18 Dollars the <HI>Min|danao</HI> Ounce. But for Bees-wax and Clove-bark, I do not remember the rate; neither do I well re|member the rates of <HI>Europe</HI> Commodities; but I think the rate of Iron was not above four Dollars a Hundred. Captain <HI>Goodlud</HI>'s Letter concluded thus. <HI>Tru&s;t none of them, for they are all Thieves, but Tace is Latin for a Candle.</HI> We under&s;tood afterwards that Captain <HI>Goodlud</HI> was robb'd of &s;ome Goods by one of the General's Men, and that he that robb'd him was fled into the Mountains, and could not be found while Captain <HI>Goodlud</HI> was here. But the Fellow returning back to the City &s;ome time after our arrival here, <HI>Raja Laut</HI> brought him bound to Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and told him what he had done, de&s;iring him to puni&s;h him for it as he plea&s;ed; but Captain <HI>Swan</HI> excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and &s;aid it did not belong to him, therefore he would have no|thing to do with it. However, the General <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> would not pardon him, but puni&s;hed him ac|cording to their own Cu&s;tom, which I did never &s;ee but at this time.</P>
<P>He was &s;tript &s;tark naked in the Morning at Sun|ri&s;ing, and bound to a Po&s;t, &s;o that he could not &s;tir Hand nor Foot, but as he was mov'd; and was placed with his Face Ea&s;tward again&s;t the Sun. In the Afternoon they turn'd his Face towards the We&s;t, that the Sun might &s;till be in his Face; and thus he &s;tood all Day, parcht in the Sun (which &s;hines here exce&s;&s;ively hot) and tormented with the Moskitos or Gnats: After this the General would have kill'd him, if Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had con&s;ented to it. I did never &s;ee any put to Death; but I believe they are barbarous enough in it: The General told us him|&s;elf
<PB N="357" REF="384">
that he put two Men to Death in a Town where &s;ome of us were with him; but I heard not the manner of it. Their common way of puni&s;h|ing is to &s;trip them in this manner, and place them in the Sun; but &s;ometimes they lay them flat on their Backs on the Sand, which is very hot; where they remain a whole Day in the &s;corching Sun, with the Moskito's biting them all the time.</P>
<P>This action of the General in offering Captain <HI>Swan</HI> the puni&s;hment of the Thief, caus'd Captain <HI>Swan</HI> afterwards to make him the &s;ame offer of his Men, when any had offended the <HI>Mindanao</HI> Men: but the General left &s;uch Offenders to be puni&s;hed by Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> as he thought convenient. So that for the lea&s;t offence Captain <HI>Swan</HI> puni&s;hed his Men, and that in the &s;ight of the <HI>Mindanaians;</HI> and I think &s;ometimes only for revenge; as he did once puni&s;h his Chief Mate Mr. <HI>Teat,</HI> he that came Cap|tain of the Bark to <HI>Mindanao.</HI> Indeed at that time Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had his Men as much under com|mand as if he had been in a King's Ship: and had he known how to u&s;e his Authority, he might have led them to any Settlement, and have brought them to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any de&s;ign he had plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan</HI> being di&s;mi&s;t from the Sultan, with abundance of civility, after about two Hours Di&s;cour&s;e with him, went thence to <HI>Raja Laut</HI>'s Hou&s;e. <HI>Raja Laut</HI> had then &s;ome difference with the Sultan, and therefore he was not pre&s;ent at the Sultan's reception of our Captain, but waited his re|turn, and treated him and all his Men with boiled Rice and Fowls. He then told Captain <HI>Swan</HI> a|gain, and urged it to him, that it would be be&s;t to get his Ship into the River as &s;oon as he could, becau&s;e of the u&s;ual tempe&s;tuous Weather at this time of the Year; and that he &s;hould want no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to further him in any thing. He told him al|&s;o, that as we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;tay here &s;ome
<PB N="358" REF="385">
time, &s;o our Men would often come a&s;hore; and he therefore de&s;ired him to warn his Men to be careful to give no afront to the Natives; who, he &s;aid, were very revengeful. That their Cu&s;toms being different from ours, he feared that Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Men might &s;ome time or other offend them, though ignorantly; that therefore he gave him this friendly warning, to prevent it: that his Hou&s;e &s;hould always be open to receive him or any of his Men, and that he knowing our Cu&s;toms, would never be offended at any thing. After a great deal of &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e he di&s;mi&s;t the Captain and his Company, who took their leave and came aboard.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan</HI> having &s;een the two Letters, did not doubt but that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did de&s;ign to &s;ettle a Factory here: therefore he did not much &s;cruple the hone&s;ty of the&s;e People, but immediately or|dered us to get the Ship into the River. The Ri|ver upon which the City of <HI>Mindanao</HI> &s;tands is but &s;mall, and hath not above 10 or 11 Foot Water on the Bar at a Spring-tide: therefore we lightened our Ship, and the Spring coming on, we with much ado got her into the River, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by 50 or 60 <HI>Mindanaian</HI> Fi&s;hermen, who liv'd at the Mouth of the River; <HI>Raja Laut</HI> him&s;elf being a|board our Ship to direct them. We carried her about a quarter of a Mile up, within the Mouth of the River, and there moored her, Head and Stern in a hole, where we always rode afloat. After this the Citizens of <HI>Mindanao</HI> came frequently a|board, to invite our Men to their Hou&s;es, and to offer us Pagallies. 'Twas a long time &s;ince any of us had received &s;uch Friend&s;hip, and therefore we were the more ea&s;ily drawn to accept of their kindne&s;&s;es; and in a very &s;hort time mo&s;t of our Men got a Comrade or two, and as many Pagal|lies; e&s;pecially &s;uch of us as had good Cloths, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ore of Gold, as many had, who were of the
<PB N="359" REF="386">
number of tho&s;e, that accompanied Captain <HI>Harris</HI> over the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> the re&s;t of us being Poor enough. Nay, the very Poore&s;t and Meane&s;t of us could hardly pa&s;s the Streets, but we were even hal'd by Force into their Hou&s;es, to be treated by them; altho' their Treats were but mean, <HI>viz.</HI> Tobacco, or Betel-Nut, or a little &s;weet &s;piced Wa|ter. Yet their &s;eeming Sincerity, Simplicity, and the manner of be&s;towing the&s;e Gifts, made them very acceptable. When we came to their Hou&s;es, they would always be prai&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as decla|ring that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Mindanaians</HI> were all one. This they expre&s;t by putting their two Fore-fingers clo&s;e together, and &s;aying, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Min|danaians</HI> were <HI>&s;amo, &s;amo,</HI> that is, <HI>all one.</HI> Then they would draw their Fore-fingers half a Foot a&s;under, and &s;ay the <HI>Dutch</HI> and they were <HI>Bugeto,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies &s;o, that they were at &s;uch di&s;tance in point of Friend&s;hip: And for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they would make a greater Repre&s;entation of di&s;tance than for the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Fearing the&s;e, but having felt, and &s;marted from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had once almo&s;t brought them under.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan</HI> did &s;eldom go into any Hou&s;e at fir&s;t, but into <HI>Raja Laut</HI>'s. There he dined commonly every day; and as many of his Men as were a&s;hore, and had no Money to Entertain them&s;elves, re&s;ort|ed thither about twelve a Clock, where they had Rice enough boiled and well dre&s;t, and &s;ome &s;craps of Fowls, or bits of Buffaloe, dre&s;t very na&s;tily. Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> was &s;erved a little better, and his two Trumpeters &s;ounded all the time that he was at Din|ner. After Dinner <HI>Raja Laut</HI> would &s;it and Di&s;cour&s;e with him mo&s;t part of the Afternoon. It was now the <HI>Ramdam</HI> time, therefore the General ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf, that he could not Entertain our Captain with Dances, and other Pa&s;times, as he intended to do when this &s;olemn Time was pa&s;t;
<PB N="360" REF="387">
be&s;ides, it was the very heighth of the wet Sea&s;on, and therefore not &s;o proper for Pa&s;times.</P>
<P>We had now very tempe&s;tuous Weather, and exce&s;&s;ive Rains, which &s;o &s;well'd the River, that it overflowed its Banks; &s;o that we had much ado to keep our Ship &s;afe: For every now and then we &s;hould have a great Tree come floating down the River, and &s;ometimes lodge again&s;t our Bows, to the endangering the breaking our Cables, and either the driving us in, over the Banks, or carrying us out to Sea; both which would have been very dangerous to us, e&s;pecially being without Balla&s;t.</P>
<P>The City is about a Mile long (of no great breadth) winding with the Banks of the River on the Right Hand going up, tho' it hath many Hou&s;es on the other &s;ide too. But at this time it &s;eemed to &s;tand as in a Pond, and there was no pa&s;&s;ing from one Hou&s;e to another but in Canoas. This tem|pe&s;tuous rainy Weather happened the latter end of <HI>July,</HI> and la&s;ted mo&s;t part of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When the bad Weather was a little a&s;&s;waged, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> hired a Hou&s;e to put our Sails and Goods in, while we carren'd our Ship. We had a great deal of Iron and Lead, which was brought a&s;hore into this Hou&s;e. Of the&s;e Commodities Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;old to the Sultan or General, Eight or Ten Tuns, at the Rates agreed on by Captain <HI>Goodlud,</HI> to be paid in Rice. The <HI>Mindanaians</HI> are no good Accomptants; there&s;ore the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> that live here, do ca&s;t up their Accompts for them. After this, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> bought Timber-trees of the General, and &s;et &s;ome of our Men to Saw them into Planks, to Sheath the Ship's bottom. He had two Whip-Saws on Board, which he brought out of <HI>England,</HI> and four or five Men that knew the u&s;e of them, for they had been Sawyers in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="388">
When the <HI>Ramdam</HI> time was over, and the dry time &s;et in a little, the General, to oblige Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> entertained him every Night with Dances. The dancing Women that are purpo&s;ely bred up to it, and make it their Trade, I have already de|&s;cribed. But be&s;ide them, all the Women in gene|ral are much addicted to Dancing. They Dance 40 or 50 at once; and that &s;tanding all round in a Ring, joined Hand in Hand, and Singing and keep|ing time. But they never budge out of their places, nor make any motion till the Chorus is Sung; then all at once they throw out one Leg, and bawl out aloud; and &s;ometime they only clap their Hands when the Chorus is Sung. Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> to re|taliate the General's Favours, &s;ent for his Violins, and &s;ome that could Dance <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dances; where|with the General was very well plea&s;ed. They commonly &s;pent the bigge&s;t part of the Night in the&s;e &s;ort of Pa&s;times.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of our Men that did u&s;e to Dance thus before the General, there was one <HI>John Thacker,</HI> who was a Seaman bred, and could neither Write nor Read; but had formerly learnt to Dance in the Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es about <HI>Wapping:</HI> This Man came into the <HI>South Seas</HI> with Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> and getting with him a good quantity of Gold, and be|ing a pretty good Husband of his Share, had &s;till &s;ome left, be&s;ides what he laid out in a very good Suit of Cloaths. The General &s;uppo&s;ed by his Garb and his Dancing, that he had been of noble Ex|traction; and to be &s;atisfy'd of his Quality, asked of one of our Men, if he did not gue&s;s aright of him? The Man of whom the General asked this Que&s;tion told him, he was much in the right; and that mo&s;t of our Ship's Company were of the like Extraction; e&s;pecially all tho&s;e that had fine Cloaths; and that they came abroad only to &s;ee the World, having Money enough to bear their Ex|expences
<PB N="362" REF="389">
where-ever they came; but that for the re&s;t, tho&s;e that had but mean Clothes, they were only common Seamen. After this, the General &s;hew'd a great deal of Re&s;pect to all that had good Clothes, but e&s;pecially to <HI>John Thacker,</HI> till Captain <HI>Swan</HI> came to know the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and marr'd all; undeceiving the General, and drubbing the Noble-Man: For he was &s;o much incen&s;ed a|gain&s;t <HI>John Thacker,</HI> that he could never indure him afterwards; tho' the poor Fellow knew nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>November</HI> we began to work on our Ship's bottom, which we found very much eaten with the Worm: For this is a horrid place for Worms. We did not know this till after we had been in the River a Month; and then we found our Canoas bottoms eaten like Honey-combs; our Bark, which was a &s;ingle bottom, was eaten thro'; &s;o that &s;he could not &s;wim. But our Ship was &s;heath|ed, and the Worm came no farther than the Hair between the &s;heathing Plank, and the main Plank. We did not mi&s;tru&s;t the General's Knavery till now: for when he came down to our Ship, and found us ripping off the &s;heathing Plank, and &s;aw the firm bottom underneath, he &s;hook his Head, and &s;eem|ed to be di&s;contented; &s;aying, he did never &s;ee a Ship with two bottoms before. We were told that in this place, where we now lay, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship was earen up in two Months time, and the General had all her Guns; and it is probable he did expect to have had Ours: Which I do believe was the main Rea&s;on that made him &s;o forward in a&s;&s;i&s;ting us to get our Ship into the River, for when we went out again we had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. We had no Worms till we came to this place: For when we Careen'd at the <HI>Marias,</HI> the Worm had not touch'd us; nor at <HI>Guam,</HI> for there we &s;crubb'd; nor after we came to the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao;</HI> for at the S. E. end of the
<PB N="363" REF="390">
I&s;land we heel'd and &s;crubb'd al&s;o. The <HI>Mindanai|ans</HI> are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e de&s;tructive In&s;ects, that whenever they come from Sea, they immediately hale their Ship into a dry Dock, and burn her bot|tom, and there let her lye dry till they are ready to get to Sea again. The Canoas or Proes they hale up dry, and never &s;uffer them to be long in the Water. It is reported that tho&s;e Worms which get into a Ships bottom in the &s;alt Water, will die in the fre&s;h Water; and that the fre&s;h Water Worms will die in &s;alt Water: but in bracki&s;h Water both &s;orts will increa&s;e prodigiou&s;ly. Now this place where we lay was &s;ometimes bracki&s;h Water, yet commonly fre&s;h; but what &s;ort of Worm this was I know not. Some Men are of Opinion, that the&s;e Worms breed in the Plank; but I am per&s;waded they breed in the Sea: For I have &s;een Millions of them &s;wimming in the Water, particularly in the Bay of <HI>Panama;</HI> for there Captain <HI>Davis,</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and my &s;elf, and mo&s;t of our Men, did take notice of them divers times, which was the rea&s;on of our Cleaning &s;o often while we were there: and the&s;e were the large&s;t Worms that I did ever &s;ee. I have al&s;o &s;een them in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> in the latter of which places the Worms eat prodigiou&s;ly. They are alway in Bays, Creeks, Mouths of Rivers, and &s;uch places as are near the &s;hore; being never found far out at Sea, that I could ever learn: yet a Ship will bring them lodg'd in its Plank for a great way.</P>
<P>Having thus ript off all our Worm-eaten Plank, and clapt on new, by the beginning of <HI>December</HI> 1686, our Ships bottom was &s;heathed and tallowed, and the 10th Day went over the Bar, and took aboard the Iron and Lead that we could not &s;ell, and began to fill our Water, and fetch aboard Rice for our Voyage: But C. <HI>Swan</HI> remain'd a&s;hore &s;till, and was not yet determin'd when to &s;ail, or whither.
<PB N="364" REF="391">
But I am well a&s;&s;ured that he did never intend to Crui&s;e about <HI>Manila,</HI> as his Crew de&s;igned; for I did once ask him, and he told me, That what he had already done of that kind he was forc'd to; but now being at Liberty, he would never more Engage in any &s;uch De&s;ign: For, &s;aid he, there is no Prince on Earth is able to wipe off the Stain of &s;uch Actions. What other De&s;igns he had I know not, for he was commonly very Cro&s;s; yet he did never pro|po&s;e doing any thing el&s;e, but only ordered the Provi&s;ion to be got Aboard in order to Sail; and I am confident if he had made a motion to go to any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory, mo&s;t of his Men would have con|&s;ented to it, tho' probably &s;ome would have &s;till oppo&s;ed it. However, his Authority might &s;oon have over-&s;way'd tho&s;e that were Refractory; for it was very &s;trange to &s;ee the Awe that the&s;e Men were in of him, for he puni&s;hed the mo&s;t &s;tubborn and daring of his Men. Yet when we had brought the Ship out into the Road, they were not altoge|ther &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, as while it lay in the River, tho' even then it was that he puni&s;hed Captain <HI>Teat.</HI></P>
<P>I was at that time a Hunting with the General for Beef, which he had a long time promi&s;ed us. But now I &s;aw that there was no Credit to be gi|ven to his Word; for I was a Week out with him and &s;aw but four Cows, which were &s;o wild, that we did not get one. There were five or &s;ix more of our Company with me; the&s;e who were young Men, and had <HI>Dalilahs</HI> there, which made them fond of the Place, all agreed with the General to tell Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> that there were Beeves enough, only they were wild. But I told him the Truth, and advi&s;ed him not to be too credulous of the Gene|ral's Promi&s;es. He &s;eemed to be very angry, and &s;tormed behind the General's Back, but in his Pre|&s;ence was very mute, being a Man of &s;mall Cou|rage.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="392">
It was about the 20th Day of <HI>December</HI> when we returned from Hunting, and the General de&s;igned to go again to another place to Hunt for Beef; but he &s;tayed till after <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> becau&s;e &s;ome of us de&s;igned to go with him; and Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had de&s;ired all his Men to be aboard that Day, that we might keep it &s;olemnly together: And accord|ingly he &s;ent aboard a Buffaloe the Day before, that we might have a good Dinner. So the 25th Day about 10 a Clock, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> came aboard, and all his Men who were a&s;hore: For you mu&s;t under&s;tand that near a third of our Men lived con|&s;tantly a&s;hore, with their Comrades and Pagallies, and &s;ome with Women &s;ervants, whom they hired of their Ma&s;ters for Concubines. Some of our Men al&s;o had Hou&s;es, which they hired or bought, for Hou&s;es are very cheap, for five or &s;ix Dollars. For many of them having more Mony than they knew what to do with, ea&s;ed them&s;elves here of the trouble of telling it, &s;pending it very lavi&s;hly, their prodigality making the People impo&s;e upon them, to the making the re&s;t of us pay the dearer for what we bought, and to the endangering the like impo&s;i|tions upon &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> as may come here here|after. For the <HI>Mindanaians</HI> knew how to get our Squires Gold from them (for we had no Silver,) and when our Men wanted Silver, they would change now and then an Ounce of Gold, and could get for it no more than 10 or 11 Dollars for a <HI>Min|danao</HI> Ounce, which they would not part with again under 18 Dollars. Yet this, and the great prices the <HI>Mindanaians</HI> &s;et on their Goods, were not the only way to le&s;&s;en their &s;tocks; for their Pa|gallies and Comrades would often be begging &s;omewhat of them, and our Men were generous enough, and would be&s;tow half an Ounce of Gold at a time, in a Ring for their Pagallies, or in a Silver Wri&s;t-band, or Hoop to come about their
<PB N="366" REF="393">
Arms, in hopes to get a Nights Lodging with them.</P>
<P>When we were all aboard on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> and his two Merchants; I did expect that Captain <HI>Swan</HI> would have made &s;ome pro|po&s;als, or have told us his de&s;igns; but he only dined and went a&s;hore again, without &s;peaking a|ny thing of his Mind. Yet even then I do think that he was driving on a de&s;ign, of going to one of the Spice I&s;lands, to load with Spice; for the Young Man before mentioned, who I &s;aid was &s;ent by his Unkle, the Sultan of a Spice I&s;land near <HI>Ternate,</HI> to invite the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to their I&s;land, came aboard at this time, and after &s;ome private Di&s;|cour&s;e with Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> they both went a&s;hore together. This Young Man did not care that the <HI>Mindanaians</HI> &s;hould be privy to what he &s;aid. I have heard Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;ay that he offered to load his Ship with Spice, provided he would build a &s;mall Fort, and leave &s;ome Men to &s;ecure the I&s;land from the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but I am &s;ince informed, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have now got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The next Day after <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> the General went away again, and five or &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> with him, of whom I was one, under pretence of going a hunt|ing; and we all went together by Water in his Proe, together with his Women and Servants, to the hunting place. The General always carried his Wives and Children, his Servants, his Money and Goods with him: &s;o we all imbarked in the Morning, and arrived there before Night. I have already de&s;cribed the fa&s;hion of their Proes, and the Rooms made in them. We were entertained in the General's Room or Cabbin. Our Voyage was not &s;o far, but that we reached our Port before Night.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="394">
At this time one of the General's Servants had offended, and was puni&s;hed in this manner: He was bound fa&s;t flat on his Belly, on a Bamboe be|longing to the Proe, which was &s;o near the Wa|ter, that by the Ve&s;&s;el's motion, it frequently del|ved under Water, and the Man along with it; and &s;ometimes when hoi&s;ted up, he had &s;carce time to blow before he would be carried under Water a|gain.</P>
<P>When we had rowed about two Leagues, we entred a pretty large deep River, and rowed up a League further, the Water &s;alt all the way. There was a pretty large Village, the Hou&s;es built after the Country fa&s;hion. We landed at this place, where there was a Hou&s;e made ready immediately for us. The General and his Women lay at one end of the Hou&s;e, and we at the other end, and in the Evening all the Women in the Village danced be|fore the General.</P>
<P>While he &s;taid here, the General with his Men went out every Morning betimes, and did not re|turn till four or five a Clock in the Afternoon, and he would often complement us, by telling us what good Tru&s;t and Confidence he had in us, &s;aying, that he left his Women and Goods under our Protection, and that he thought them as &s;ecure with us &s;ix, (for we had all our Arms with us) as if he had left 100 of his own Men to guard them. Yet for all this great Confidence, he always left one of his principal Men, for fear &s;ome of us &s;hould be too familiar with his Women.</P>
<P>They did never &s;tir out of their own Room when the General was at Home, but as &s;oon as he was gone out, they would pre&s;ently come into our Room, and &s;it with us all Day, and ask a Thou|&s;and Que&s;tions of us concerning our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wo|men, and our Cu&s;toms. You may imagin that be|fore this time, &s;ome of us had attained &s;o much of
<PB N="368" REF="395">
their Language as to under&s;tand them, and give them An&s;wers to their Demands. I remember that one Day they asked how many Wives the King of <HI>England</HI> had? We told them but one, and that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws did not allow of any more. They &s;aid it was a &s;trange Cu&s;tom, that a Man &s;hould be con&s;ined to one Woman; &s;ome of them &s;aid it was a very bad Law, but others again &s;aid it was a good Law; &s;o there was a great Di&s;pute a|mong them about it. But one of the General's Women &s;aid po&s;itively, That our Law was better than theirs, and made them all &s;ilent by the Rea&s;on which &s;he gave for it. This was the <HI>War Queen,</HI> as we called her, for &s;he did always Accompany the General when ever he was called out to Engage his Enemies, but the re&s;t did not.</P>
<P>By this Familiarity among the Women, and by often di&s;cour&s;ing them, we came to be acquainted with their Cu&s;toms and Priviledges. The General lies with his Wives by turns; but &s;he by whom he had the fir&s;t Son, has a double Portion of his Com|pany: For when it comes to her turn, &s;he has him two Nights, whereas the re&s;t have him but one. She with whom he is to lye at Night, &s;eems to have a particular Re&s;pect &s;hewn her by the re&s;t all the precedent Day; and for a Mark of di&s;tinction, wears a &s;triped &s;ilk Handkerchief about her Neck, by which we knew who was Queen that Day.</P>
<P>We lay here about five or &s;ix Days, but did never in all that time &s;ee the lea&s;t &s;ign of any Beef, which was the Bu&s;ine&s;s we came about; neither were we &s;uffered to go out with the General to &s;ee the wild Kine, but we wanted for nothing el&s;e: However, this did not plea&s;e us, and we often im|portuned him to let us go out among the Cattle. At la&s;t he told us, That he had provided a Jar of Rice-drink to be merry with us, and after that we &s;hould go with him.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="396">
<MILESTONE N="1687" UNIT="year"> This Rice-drink is made of Rice boiled and put into a Jar, where it remains a long time &s;teep|ing in Water. I know not the manner of making it, but it is very &s;trong plea&s;ant Drink: The Even|ing when the General de&s;igned to be merry, he cau&s;ed a Jar of this Drink to be brought into our Room, and he began to drink fir&s;t him&s;elf, then afterwards his Men; &s;o they took turns till they were all as drunk as Swine, before they &s;uffered us to drink. After they had enough, then we drank, and they drank no more, for they will not drink after us. The General leapt about our Room a little while; but having his Load &s;oon went to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The next Day we went out with the General into the Savannah, where he had near 100 Men making of a large Pen to drive the Cattle into. For that is the manner of their Hunting, having no Dogs. But I &s;aw not above 8 or 10 Cows, and tho&s;e as wild as Deer, &s;o that we got none this Day: yet the next Day &s;ome of his Men brought in 3 Heifers, which they kill'd in the Savannah. With the&s;e we returned aboard, they being all that we got there.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Swan</HI> was much vext at the Generals Actions; for he promi&s;ed to &s;upply us with as much Beef as we &s;hould want, but now either could not, or would not make good his Promi&s;e. Be&s;ides, he failed to perform his Promi&s;e in a bargain of Rice, that we were to have for the Iron which he &s;old him, but he put us off &s;till from time to time, and would not come to any Account. Neither were the&s;e all his Tricks; for a little before his Son was Circumci&s;ed, (of which I &s;pake in the forego|ing Chapter) he pretended a great &s;treight for Money, to defray the Charges of that Day; and therefore de&s;ired Captain <HI>Swan</HI> to lend him about 20 Ounces of Gold; for he knew that Captain
<PB N="370" REF="397">
<HI>Swan</HI> had a con&s;iderable quantity of Gold in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which the General thought was his own, but indeed had none but what belonged to the Merchants. However he lent it the General, but when he came to an Account with Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> he told him, that it was u&s;ual at &s;uch &s;o|lemn times to make Pre&s;ents, and that he received it as a Gift. He al&s;o demanded Payment for the Victuals that our Captain and his Men did eat at his Hou&s;e. The&s;e things &s;tartled Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> yet how to help him&s;elf he knew not. But all this, with other inward troubles, lay hard on our Captain's Spirits, and put him very much out of Humour; for his own Company al&s;o were pre&s;&s;ing him every Day to be gone, becau&s;e, now was the heighth of the Ea&s;terly Mon&s;oon, the only Wind to carry us farther into the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>About this time &s;ome of our Men, who were weary and tired with wandring, ran away into the Country and ab&s;conded, they being a&s;&s;i&s;ted, as was generally believed, by <HI>Raja Laut.</HI> There were others al&s;o, who fearing we &s;hould not go to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Port, bought a Canoa, and de&s;igned to go in her to <HI>Borneo:</HI> For not long before a <HI>Mindanao</HI> Ve&s;&s;el came from thence, and brought a Letter di|rected to the chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory at <HI>Min|danao.</HI> This Letter the General would have Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> have opened, but he thought it might come from &s;ome of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Merchants who&s;e Affairs he would not intermeddle with, and there|fore did not open it. I &s;ince met with Captain <HI>Bowry</HI> at <HI>Achin,</HI> and telling him this Story, he &s;aid that he &s;ent that Letter, &s;uppo&s;ing that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> were &s;ettled there at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and by this Letter we al&s;o thought that there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory at <HI>Borneo:</HI> &s;o here was a mi&s;take on both &s;ides. But this Canoa, wherewith &s;ome of them thought to go to <HI>Borneo,</HI> Captain <HI>Swan</HI> took from
<PB N="371" REF="398">
them, and threatned the Undertakers very hardly. However, this did not &s;o far di&s;courage them, for they &s;ecretly bought another; but their De|&s;igns taking Air, they were again fru&s;trated by Captain <HI>Swan.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Crew were at this time under a ge|neral Di&s;affection, and full of very different Pro|jects; and all for want of Action. The main Divi|&s;ion was between tho&s;e that had Money and tho&s;e that had none. There was a great Difference in the Humours of the&s;e; for they that had Money liv'd a|&s;hore, and did not care for leaving <HI>Mindanao;</HI> whil&s;t tho&s;e that were poor liv'd Aboard, and urg'd Capt <HI>Swan</HI> to go to Sea. The&s;e began to be Unruly as well as Di&s;&s;atisfy'd, and &s;ent a&s;hore the Merchants Iron to &s;ell for Rack and Honey, to make Punch, wherewith they grew Drunk and Quarel&s;ome: Which di&s;orderly Actions deterr'd me from going Aboard; for I did ever abhor Drunkenne&s;s, which now our Men that were Aboard abandon'd them|&s;elves wholly to.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e Di&s;orders might have been cru&s;ht, if Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> had u&s;ed his Authority to Suppre&s;s, them: But he with his Merchants living always a|&s;hore, there was no Command; and therefore eve|ry Man did what he plea&s;ed and encouraged each other in his Villanies. Now Mr. <HI>Harthop,</HI> who was one of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Merchants, did very much importune him to &s;ettle his Re&s;olutions, and declare his Mind to his Men; which at la&s;t he con&s;ented to do. Therefore he gave warning to all his Men to come Aboard the 13th day of <HI>January,</HI> 1687.</P>
<P>We did all earne&s;tly expect to hear what Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI> would propo&s;e, and therefore were very willing to go Aboard. But unluckily for him, two days before this Meeting was to be, Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;ent Aboard his Gunner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to fetch &s;omething a&s;hore out of his Cabbin. The Gunner rummaging to
<PB N="372" REF="399">
find what he was &s;ent for, among other things took out the Captain's Journal, from <HI>America</HI> to the I&s;land <HI>Guam,</HI> and laid down by him. This Journal was taken up by one <HI>John Read,</HI> a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> man, whom I have mentioned in my 4th Chapter. He was a pretty Ingenious young Man, and of a very civil carriage and behaviour. He was al&s;o accounted a good Arti&s;t, and kept a Journal, and was now prompted by his curio&s;ity, to peep into Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Journal, to &s;ee how it agreed with his own; a thing very u&s;ual among Seamen that keep Journals, when they have an opportunity, and e&s;pecially young Men, who have no great ex|perience. At the fir&s;t opening of the Book he light on a place in which Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had inveighed bitterly again&s;t mo&s;t of his Men, e&s;pecially again&s;t another <HI>John Reed</HI> a <HI>Jamaica</HI> man. This was &s;uch &s;tuff as he did not &s;eek after: But hitting &s;o pat on this &s;ubject, his curio&s;ity led him to pry farther; and therefore while the Gunner was bu&s;ie, he convey'd the Book away, to look over it at his lei&s;ure. The Gunner having di&s;patch'd his bu&s;ine&s;s, lock'd up the Cabbin-door, not mi&s;&s;ing the Book, and went a&s;hore. Then <HI>John Reed</HI> &s;hewed it to his Name-&s;ake, and to the re&s;t that were aboard, who were by this time the bigge&s;t part of them ripe for mi&s;|chief; only wanting &s;ome fair pretence to &s;et them|&s;elves to work about it. Therefore looking on what was written in this Journal to be matter &s;ufficient for them to accompli&s;h their Ends, Cap|tain <HI>Teat,</HI> who as I &s;aid before, had been abu&s;ed by Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> laid hold on this opportunity to be revenged for his Injuries, and aggravated the matter to the height; per&s;wading the Men to turn out Captain <HI>Swan</HI> from being Commander, in hopes to have commanded the Ship him&s;elf. As for the Sea-men they were ea&s;ily per&s;waded to any thing; for they were quite tired with this long and
<PB N="373" REF="400">
tedious Voyage, and mo&s;t of them de&s;paired of ever getting home, and therefore did not care what they did, or whither they went. It was only want of being bu&s;ied in &s;ome Action that made them &s;o unea&s;ie; therefore they con&s;ented to what <HI>Teat</HI> propo&s;ed, and immediately all that were aboard bound them&s;elves by Oath to turn Captain <HI>Swan</HI> out, and to conceal this de&s;ign from tho&s;e that were a&s;hore, until the Ship was under Sail; which would have been pre&s;ently, if the Surgeon or his Mate had been aboard; but they were both a&s;hore, and they thought it no Prudence to go to Sea with|out a Surgeon: Therefore the next Morning they &s;ent a&s;hore one <HI>John Cookworthy,</HI> to ha&s;ten off either the Surgeon or his Mate, by pretending that one of the Men in the Night broke his Leg by falling into the Hold. The Surgeon told him that he in|tended to come aboard the next day with the Cap|tain, and would not come before; but &s;ent his Mate, <HI>Herman Coppinger.</HI></P>
<P>This Man &s;ometime before this, was &s;leeping at his Pagallies, and a Snake twi&s;ted him&s;elf about his Neck; but after wards went away without hurting him. In this Country it is u&s;ual to have the Snakes come into the Hou&s;es, and into the Ships too; for we had &s;everal came aboard our Ship when we lay in the River. But to proceed, <HI>Herman Coppinger</HI> provided to go aboard; and the next day, being the time appointed for Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and all his Men to meet aboard, I went aboard with him, nei|ther of us mi&s;tru&s;ted what was de&s;igning by tho&s;e aboard, till we came thither. Then we found it was only a trick to get the Surgeon off; for now, having obtained their De&s;ires, the Canoa was &s;ent a&s;hore again immediately, to de&s;ire as many as they could meet to come aboard; but not to tell the Rea&s;on, left Captain <HI>Swan</HI> &s;hould come to hear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="401">
The 13th day in the Morning they weighed, and fired a Gun: Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> immediately &s;ent a|board Mr. <HI>Nelly,</HI> who was now his chief Mate, to &s;ee what the matter was: To him they told all their Grievances, and &s;hewed him the Journal. He per|&s;waded them to &s;tay till the next day, for an An|&s;wer from Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and the Merchants. So they came to an Anchor again, and the next Morn|ing Mr. <HI>Harthop</HI> came aboard: He per&s;waded them to be reconciled again, or at lea&s;t to &s;tay and get more Rice: But they were deaf to it, and weigh|ed again while he was aboard Yet at Mr. <HI>Harthop</HI>'s Per&s;wa&s;ion they promi&s;ed to &s;tay till 2 a Clock in the Afternoon for Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Men, if they would come aboard; but they &s;uffered no Man to go a&s;hore, except one <HI>William Williams</HI> that had a wooden Leg, and another that was a Sawyer.</P>
<P>If Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> had yet come aboard, he might have da&s;h'd all their de&s;igns; but he neither came him&s;elf, as a Captain of any Prudence and Cou|rage would have done, nor &s;ent till the time was expired. So we left Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and about 36 Men a&s;hore in the City, and 6 or 8 that run away; and about 16 we had buried there, the mo&s;t of which died by Poi&s;on. The Natives are very ex|pert at Poi&s;oning, and do it upon &s;mall occa&s;ions: Nor did our Men want for giving Offence, through their general Rogueries, and &s;ometimes by dallying too familiarly with their Women, even before their Faces. Some of their Poi&s;ons are &s;low and linger|ing; for we had &s;ome now aboard who were Poi|&s;on'd there; but died not till &s;ome Months after.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE 14th day of <HI>January,</HI> 1687, at 3 of the Clock in the Afternoon, we &s;ailed from the River of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> de&s;igning to crui&s;e before <HI>Mani|la.</HI></P>
<P>It was during our &s;tay at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> that we were fir&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of the change of time, in the cour&s;e of our Voyage. For having Travell'd &s;o far We&s;tward, keeping the &s;ame Cour&s;e with the Sun, we mu&s;t con&s;equently have gain'd &s;ome|thing in&s;en&s;ibly in the length of the particular Days, but have lo&s;t in the tale, the bulk, or num|ber of the Days or Hours. According to the diffe|rent Longitudes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Mindanao,</HI> this I&s;le being We&s;t from the <HI>Lizzard,</HI> by common Computation, about 210 Degrees, the difference of time at our Arrival at <HI>Mindanao</HI> ought to be about 14 Hours: and &s;o much we &s;hould have anticipated our reckoning, having gained it by bearing the Sun company. Now the natural Day in every par|ticular place mu&s;t be con&s;onant to it &s;elf: but this going about with, or again&s;t the Suns cour&s;e, will of nece&s;&s;ity make a difference in the Calculation of the civil Day between any two places. Accord|ingly, at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and all other places in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
<PB N="377" REF="404">
we found them reckoning a Day before us, both Natives and <HI>Europeans;</HI> for rhe <HI>Europeans</HI> com|ing Ea&s;tward by the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> in a Cour&s;e contrary to the Sun and us, where-ever we met they were a full Day before us in their Ac|counts. So among the <HI>Indian Mahometans</HI> here, their <HI>Friday,</HI> the Day of their Sultan's going to their Mo&s;ques, was <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> with us; though it were <HI>Friday</HI> al&s;o with tho&s;e who came Ea&s;tward from <HI>Europe.</HI> Yet at the <HI>Ladrone</HI> I&s;lands, we found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Guam</HI> keeping the &s;ame Computation with our &s;elves; the rea&s;on of which I take to be, that they &s;ettled that Colony by a Cour&s;e We&s;tward from <HI>Spain;</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> going fir&s;t to <HI>America,</HI> and thence to the <HI>Ladrones</HI> and <HI>Philippines.</HI> But how the reckoning was at <HI>Manila,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Colonies in the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, I know not; whether they keep it as they brought it, or correct|ed it by the Accounts of the Natives, and of the <HI>Portugueze, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> coming the contrary way from <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>One great Rea&s;on why Seamen ought to keep the difference of time as exact as they can, is, that they may be the more exact in their Latitudes. For our Tables of the Suns declination, being cal|culated for the Meridians of the places in which they were made, differ about 12 Minutes from tho&s;e parts of the World that lie on their oppo&s;ite Meridians, in the Months of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Septem|ber;</HI> and in proportion to the Suns declination, at other times of the Year al&s;o. And &s;hould they run farther as we did, the difference would &s;till in|crea&s;e upon them, and be an occa&s;ion of great Er|rours. Yet even able Seamen in the&s;e Voyages are hardly made &s;en&s;ible of this, tho' &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, for want of duly attending to the rea&s;on of it, as it happened among tho&s;e of our Crew; who after we had pa&s;t 180 Degrees, began
<PB N="378" REF="405">
to decrea&s;e the difference of declination, whereas they ought &s;till to have increa&s;ed it, for it all the way increa&s;ed upon us.</P>
<P>We had the Wind at N. N. E, fair clear Wea|ther, and a brisk Gale. We coa&s;ted to the We&s;t|ward, on the South-&s;ide of the I&s;land of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> keeping within 4 or 5 Leagues of the Shore. The Land from hence tends away W. by S. It is of a good heighth by the Sea, and very woody, and in the Country we &s;aw high Hills.</P>
<P>The next Day we were abre&s;t of <HI>Chambongo;</HI> a Town in this I&s;land, and 30 Leagues from the Ri|ver of <HI>Mindanao.</HI> Here is &s;aid to be a good Har|bour, and a great Settlement, with plenty of Beef and Buffaloe. It is reported that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were formerly fortified here al&s;o: There are two &s;hoals lie off this place, 2 or 3 Leagues from the Shoar. From hence the Land is more low and even; yet there are &s;ome Hills in the Country.</P>
<P>About 6 Leagues before we came to the We&s;t-end of the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao,</HI> we fell in with a great ma|ny &s;mall low I&s;lands or Keys, and about two or three Leagues to the Southward of the&s;e Keys, there is a long I&s;land &s;tretching N. E. and S. W. about 12 Leagues. This I&s;land is low by the Sea on the North-&s;ide, and has a Ridge of Hills in the mid|dle, running from one end to the other. Between this I&s;le and the &s;mall Keys, there is a good large Channel: Among the Keys al&s;o there is a good depth of Water, and a violent Tide; but on what point of the Compa&s;s it flows, I know not, nor how much it ri&s;eth and falls.</P>
<P>The 17th day we anchored on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of all the&s;e Keys, in 8 fathom Water, clean Sand. Here are plenty of green Turtle, who&s;e Fle&s;h is as &s;weet as any in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> but they are very &s;hy. A little to the We&s;tward of the&s;e Keys, on the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao,</HI> we &s;aw abundance of Coco-nut Trees:
<PB N="379" REF="406">
Therefore we &s;ent our Canoa a&s;hore, thinking to find Inhabitants, but found none, nor &s;ign of any; but great Tracts of Hogs, and great Cattle; and clo&s;e by the Sea there were Ruins of an old Fort. The Walls thereof were of a good heighth, built with Stone and Lime; and by the Workman&s;hip &s;eem'd to be <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> From this place the Land trends W. N. W. and it is of an indifferent heighth by the Sea. It run on this point of the Compa&s;s 4 or 5 Leagues, and then the Land trends away N. N. W. 5 or 6 Leagues farther, making with many bluff Points.</P>
<P>We weigh'd again the 14th day, and went thro between the Keys; but met &s;uch uncertain Tides, that we were forced to anchor again. The 22d day we got about the We&s;termo&s;t Point of all <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and &s;tood to the Northward, plying under the Shore, and having the Wind at N. N. E. a fre&s;h Gale. As we &s;ailed along further, we found the Land to trend N. N. E. On this part of the I&s;land the Land is high by the Sea, with full bluff Points, and very woody. There are &s;ome &s;mall Sandy Bays, which afford Streams of fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>Here we met with two Prows belonging to the <HI>Sologues,</HI> one of the <HI>Mindanaiin</HI> Nations before-mentioned. They came from <HI>Manila</HI> laden with Silks and Calicoes. We kept on this We&s;tern part of the I&s;land &s;teering Northerly, till we came a|bre&s;t of &s;ome other of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, that lay to the Northward of us; then &s;teered away towards them; but &s;till keeping on the We&s;t &s;ide of them, and we had the Winds at N. N. E.</P>
<P>The 3d of <HI>February</HI> we anchored in a good Bay on the We&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, in Lat. 9 d. 55 min. where we had 13 Fathom-water, good &s;oft Oaze. This I&s;land hath no Name that we could find in any Book, but lieth on the We&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land
<PB N="380" REF="407">
<HI>Sebo.</HI> It is about 8 or 10 Leagues long, mountain|ous and woody. At this place Captain <HI>Read,</HI> who was the &s;ame Captain <HI>Swan</HI> had &s;o much railed a|gain&s;t in his Journal, and was now made Captain in his room (as Captain <HI>Teat</HI> was made Ma&s;ter, and Mr. <HI>Henry More</HI> Quarter-Ma&s;ter) ordered the Car|penters to cut down our Quarter-Deck to make the Ship &s;nug, and the fitter for &s;ailing. When that was done we heeled her, &s;crubbed her Bottom, and tal|lowed it. Then we fill'd all our Water, for here is a delicate &s;mall run of Water.</P>
<P>The Land was pretty low in this Bay, the Mould black and fat, and the Trees of &s;everal Kinds, very thick and tall. In &s;ome places we found plenty of Canes, &s;uch as we u&s;e in <HI>England</HI> for Walking-Canes. The&s;e were &s;hort-jointed, not above two Foot and a half, or two Foot ten Inches the longe&s;t, and mo&s;t of them not above two Foot. They run along on the Ground like a Vine; or taking hold of the Trees, they climb up to their very tops. They are 15 or 20 Fathom long, and much of a bigne&s;s from the Root, till within 5 or 6 Fathom of the end. They are of a pale green Colour, cloathed over with a Coat of &s;hort thick hairy Sub&s;tance, of a dun Colour; but it comes off by only drawing the Cane through your Hand. We did cut many of them, and they proved very tough heavy Canes.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no Hou&s;es, nor &s;ign of Inhabitants; but while we lay here, there was a Canoa with 6 Men came into this Bay; but whither they were bound, or from whence they came, I know not. They were <HI>Indians,</HI> and we could not under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Bay, about a Mile from the Shore, there is a &s;mall low woody I&s;land, not above a Mile in Circumference; our Ship rode a|bout a mile from it. This I&s;land was the Habita|tion
<PB N="381" REF="408">
of an incredible number of great Batts, with Bodies as big as Ducks, or large Fowl, and with va&s;t Wings: For I &s;aw at <HI>Mindanao</HI> one of this &s;ort, and I judge that the Wings &s;tretcht out in length, could not be le&s;s a&s;&s;under than 7 or 8 Foot from tip to tip; for it was much more than any of us could fathom with our Arms extended to the utmo&s;t. The Wings are for Sub&s;tance like tho&s;e of other Batts, of a Dun or Mou&s;e colour. The Skin or Leather of them hath Ribs running along it, and draws up in 3 or 4 Folds; and at the joints of tho&s;e Ribs and the extremities of the Wings, there are &s;harp and crooked Claws, by which they may hang on any thing. In the Evening as &s;oon as the Sun was &s;et, the&s;e Creatures would begin to take their flight from this I&s;land, in &s;warms like Bees, directing their flight over to the Main I&s;land; and whither afterwards I know not. Thus we &s;hould &s;ee them ri&s;ing up from the I&s;land till Night hindred our &s;ight; and in the Morning as &s;oon as it was light, we &s;hould &s;ee them returning again like a Cloud, to the &s;mall I&s;land, till Sun ri&s;ing. This cour&s;e they kept con&s;tantly while we lay here, affording us every Morning and Evening an Hour's Diver&s;ion in gazing at them, and talking about them; but our Curio&s;ity did not prevail with us to go a&s;hoar to them, our &s;elves and Ca|noas being all the day time taken up in bu&s;ine&s;s a|bout our Ship. At this I&s;le al&s;o we found plenty of Turtle and Manatee, but no Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here till the 10th of <HI>February,</HI> 1687. and then having compleated our Bu&s;ine&s;s, we &s;ailed hence with the Wind at North. But going out we &s;truck on a Rock, where we lay two Hours: It was very &s;mooth Water, and the Tide of Flood, or el&s;e we &s;hould there have lo&s;t our Ship. We &s;truck off a great piece of our Rudder, which was all the damage that we received, but we more narrow|ly

It lies about two mile to the We&s;tward, without the &s;mall Batt I&s;land. Here we found the Tide of Flood &s;etting to the Southward, and the Ebb to the North|ward.</P>
<P>After we were pa&s;t this Shoal, we Coa&s;ted along by the re&s;t of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, keeping on the We&s;t-&s;ide of them. Some of them appeared to be very Mountainous dry Land. We &s;aw many Fires in the Night as we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Panay,</HI> a great I&s;land &s;ettled by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by the Fires up and down it &s;eems to be well &s;ettled by them; for this is a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom, whereby they give Notice of any Danger or the like from Sea; and 'tis probable they had &s;een our Ship the day before. This is an unfrequented Coa&s;t, and 'tis rare to have any Ship &s;een there. We touched not at <HI>Panay,</HI> nor any where el&s;e; tho' we &s;aw a great many &s;mall I&s;lands to the We&s;tward of us, and &s;ome Shoals, but none of them laid down in our Draughts.</P>
<P>The 18th day of <HI>Feb.</HI> we anchored at the N. W. end of the I&s;land <HI>Mindora,</HI> in 10 Fathom-water, a|bout 3 quarters of a Mile from the Shore. <HI>Mindora</HI> is a large I&s;land; the middle of it lying in Lat 13. about 40 Leagues long, &s;tretching N. W. and S. E. It is High and Mountainous, and not very Woody. At this Place where we anchored the Land was neither very high nor low. There was a &s;mall Brook of Water, and the Land by the Sea was very Woody, and the Trees high and tall, but a League or two farther in, the Woods are very thin and &s;mall. Here we &s;aw great tracks of Hogs and Beef, and we &s;aw &s;ome of each, and hunted them; but they were wild, and we could kill none.</P>

While we were here, there was a Canoa with 4 <HI>Indians</HI> came from <HI>Manila.</HI> They were very &s;hy of us a while: but at la&s;t, hearing us &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> they came to us, and told us, that they were go|ing to a Fryer, that liv'd at an <HI>Indian</HI> Village to|wards the S. E. end of the I&s;land. They told us al&s;o, that the Harbour of <HI>Manila</HI> is &s;eldom or ne|ver without 20 or 30 Sail of Ve&s;&s;els, mo&s;t <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Portugueze,</HI> and &s;ome few the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have of their own. They &s;aid, that when they had done their bu&s;ine&s;s with the Fryer they would return to <HI>Manila,</HI> and hoped to be back again at this place in 4 Days time. We told them, that we came for a Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Manila,</HI> and &s;hould be glad if they would carry a Letter to &s;ome Merchant there, which they promi&s;ed to do. But this was only a pretence of ours, to get out of them what intelligence we could as to their Shipping, Strength, and the like, under Colour of &s;eeeking a Trade; for our bu&s;ine&s;s was to pillage. Now if we had really de&s;igned to have Traded there, this was as fair an op|portunity as Men could have de&s;ired: for the&s;e Men could have brought us to the Frier that they were going to, and a &s;mall Pre&s;ent to him would have engaged him to do any kindne&s;s for us in the way of Trade: for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governours do not allow of it, and we mu&s;t Trade by &s;tealth.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t Day we went from hence with the wind at E. N. E. a &s;mall gale. The 23d Day in the Morning we were fair by the S. E. end of the I&s;land <HI>Luconia,</HI> the Place that had been &s;o long de|&s;ired by us. We pre&s;ently &s;aw a Sail coming from the Northward, and making after her we took her in 2 Hours time. She was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bark, that came from a place called <HI>Panga&s;anam,</HI> a &s;mall Town on the N. end of <HI>Luconia,</HI> as they told us; propably the &s;ame with <HI>Ponga&s;&s;inay,</HI> which lies on a Bay at the N. W. &s;ide of the I&s;land. She was bound to <HI>Manila</HI>
<PB N="384" REF="411">
but had no Goods aboard; and therefore we turned her away.</P>
<P>The 23d. we took another <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that came from the &s;ame place as the other. She was laden with Rice and Cotton-Cloth, and bound for <HI>Manila</HI> al&s;o. The&s;e Goods were purpo&s;ely for the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship: The Rice was for the Men to live on while they lay there, and in their return: and the Cotton-cloth was to make Sail. The Ma&s;ter of this Prize was Boat&s;wain of the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship which e&s;caped us at <HI>Guam,</HI> and was now at <HI>Manila.</HI> It was this Man that gave us the Relation of what Strength it had, how they were afraid of us there, and of the accident that happen'd to them, as is before mentioned in the 10th Chapter. We took the&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els with|in 7 or 8 Leagues of <HI>Manila.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luconia</HI> I have &s;poken of already: but I &s;hall now add this further account of it. It is a great I&s;land, taking up between 6 and 7 degrees of Lat. in length, and its breadth near the middle is about 60 Leagues, but the ends are narrow. The North-end lies in a|bout 19 d. North Lat. and the S. end in about 12 d. 30 m. This great I&s;land hath abundance of &s;mall Keys or I&s;lands lying about it; e&s;pecially at the North-end. The South-&s;ide fronts towards the re&s;t of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands: Of the&s;e that are its neare&s;t Neighbours, <HI>Mindora,</HI> lately mentioned, is the chief, and gives name to the Sea or Streight that parts it and the other I&s;lands from <HI>Luconia:</HI> being called the Streights of <HI>Mindora.</HI></P>
<P>The Body of the I&s;land <HI>Luconia</HI> is compo&s;ed of many &s;pacious plain Savannahs, and large Moun|tains. The North-end &s;eems to be more plain and even, I mean freer from Hills, than the South-end: but the Land is all along of a good heighth. It does not appear &s;o flouri&s;hing and green as &s;ome of the other I&s;lands in this Range; e&s;pecially that of St. <HI>John, Mindanao, Batt</HI> I&s;land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet in &s;ome

places it is very Woody. Some of the Mountains of this I&s;land afford Gold, and the Savannahs are well &s;tockt with herds of Cattle, e&s;pecially Buaffaloes. The&s;e Cattle, are in great plenty all over the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and therefore 'tis very probable that there were many of the&s;e here even before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came hither. But now there are al&s;o plenty of o|ther Cattle, as I have been told, as Bullocks, Hor&s;es, Sheep, Goats, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought hither by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>It is pretty well inhabited with <HI>Indians,</HI> mo&s;t of them, if not all, under the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who now are ma&s;ters of it. The Native <HI>Indians</HI> do live together in Towns; and they have Prie&s;ts among them to in&s;truct them in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Manila</HI> the chief, or perhaps the only City, lies at the foot of a ridge of high Hills, facing upon a &s;pacious harbour near the S. W. point of the I&s;land, in about the Lat. of 14 d. North. It is environ'd with a high &s;trong Wall, and very well fortify'd with Forts and Brea&s;t-works. The Hou&s;es are large, &s;trongly built, and covered with Pan-tile. The Streets are large and pretty regular; with a Pa|rade in the mid&s;t, after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion. There are a great many fair Buildings, be&s;ide Churches and other Religious Hou&s;es; of which there are not a few.</P>
<P>The Harbour is &s;o large, that &s;ome hundreds of Ships may ride here: and is never without many, both of their own and &s;trangers. I have already given you an account of the two Ships going and coming between this place and <HI>Acapulco.</HI> Be&s;ides them, they have &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els of their own; and they do allow the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> to trade here, but the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are the chiefe&s;t Merchants, and they drive the greate&s;t Trade; for they have commonly 20 or 30, or 40 Jonks in the Harbour at a time, and a great many Merchants con&s;tantly re&s;iding in the City,
<PB N="388" REF="414">
be&s;ide Shop-keepers, and Handy-crafts-men in a bundance. Small Ve&s;&s;els run up near the Town but the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ships and others of greater bur then, lye a league &s;hort of it, where there is a &s;trong Fort al&s;o, and Store-hou&s;es to put Goods in.</P>
<P>I had the major part of this relation 2 or 3 years after this time, from Mr. <HI>Coppinger</HI> our Surgeon; for he made a Voyage hither from <HI>Porto Nova,</HI> a Town on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel;</HI> in a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship, as I think. Here he found 10 or 12 of Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI>'s men; &s;ome of tho&s;e that we left at <HI>Mindanao.</HI> For after we came from thence, they brought a Proe there, by the In&s;tigation of an <HI>Iri&s;h man,</HI> who went by the name of <HI>John Fitz-Gerald,</HI> a per&s;on that &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> very well; and &s;o in this their Proe they came hither. They had been here but 18 months when Mr. <HI>Coppinger</HI> arrived here, and Mr. <HI>Fitz-Gerald</HI> had in this time gotten a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mu&s;te&s;a Woman to Wife, and a good Dowry with her. He then profe&s;&s;ed Phy&s;ick and Surgery, and was highly e&s;teemed among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for his &s;uppo&s;ed knowledge in tho&s;e Arts: for being al|ways troubled with &s;ore Shins while he was with us, he kept &s;ome Plai&s;ters and Salves by him; and with the&s;e he &s;et up upon his bare natural &s;tock of knowledge, and his experience in Kibes. But then he had a very great &s;tock of Confidence with|al, to help out the other, and being an <HI>Iri&s;h Roman</HI> Catholick, and having the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language, he had a great advantage of all his Con&s;orts; and he alone lived well there of them all. We were not within &s;ight of this Town, but I was &s;hewn the Hills that over-looked it, and drew a draft of them as we lay off at Sea; which I have cau&s;ed to be engraven among a few others that I took my &s;elf: <HI>See the Table.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="415">
The time of the year being now too far &s;pent to do any thing here, it was concluded to &s;ail from hence to <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> a little parcel of I&s;lands, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and carry this Prize with us, and there careen if we could find any conve|nient place for it, de&s;igning to return hither again by the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> and wait for the <HI>Aca|pulco</HI> Ship that comes about that time. By our Drafts (which we were guided by, being &s;trangers to the&s;e parts) this &s;eemed to us then to be a place out of the way, where we might lye &s;nug for a while, and wait the time of returning for our Prey. For we avoided as much as we could the going to lye by at any great place of Com|merce, le&s;t we &s;hould become too much expo&s;ed, and perhaps be a&s;&s;aulted by a Force greater than our own.</P>
<P>So having &s;et our Pri&s;oners a&s;hore, we &s;ailed from <HI>Luconia</HI> the 26th Day of <HI>Feb.</HI> with the Wind E. N. E. and fair Weather, and a bri&s;k Gale. We were in Lat. 14 d. N. when we began to &s;teer away for <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> and we &s;teer'd S. by W. In our way thither we went pretty near the Shoals of <HI>Pracel,</HI> and other Shoals which are very dange|rous. We were very much afraid of them, but e&s;caped them without &s;o much as &s;eeing them, on|ly at the very South-end of the <HI>Pracel</HI> Shoals we &s;aw 3 little &s;andy I&s;lands or &s;pots of Sand, &s;tand|ing ju&s;t above Water within a Mile of us.</P>
<P>It was the 13th Day of <HI>March</HI> before we came in &s;ight of <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> or the I&s;land <HI>Condore,</HI> as <HI>Pulo</HI> &s;ignifies. The 14th Day about Noon we Anchored on the North-&s;ide of the I&s;land, again&s;t a &s;andy Bay 2 Mile from the Shore, in 10 Fathom clean hard Sand, with both Ship and Prize. <HI>Pulo Condore</HI> is the Principal of a heap of I&s;lands, and the only inhabited one of them. They lye in lat. 8d. 40 m. North, and about 20 Leagues South and
<PB N="390" REF="416">
by Ea&s;t from the Mouth of the River of <HI>Cambodia.</HI> The&s;e I&s;lands lye &s;o near together, that at a di|&s;tance they appear to be but one I&s;land.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e I&s;lands are pretty large, and of a good heighth, they may be &s;een 14 or 15 Leagues at Sea; the re&s;t are but little Spots. The bigge&s;t of the two (which is the inhabited one) is about 4 or 5 Leagues long, and lies Ea&s;t and We&s;t. It is not above 3 Mile broad at the broade&s;t place, in mo&s;t places not above a Mile wide. The other large I&s;land is about 3 Mile long, and half a Mile wide. This I&s;land &s;tretcheth N. and S. It is &s;o conveniently placed at the We&s;t-end of the bigge&s;t I&s;land, that between both there is formed a very commodious Harbour. The entrance of this Har|bour is on the North-&s;ide, where the two I&s;lands are near a mile a&s;under. There are 3 or 4 &s;mall Keys, and a good deep Channel between them and the bigge&s;t I&s;land. Towards the South-end of the Harbour the two I&s;lands do in a manner clo&s;e up, leaving only a &s;mall Pa&s;&s;age for Boats and Canoas. There are no more I&s;lands on the North-&s;ide, but 5 or 6 on the South-&s;ide of the great I&s;land. <HI>See the Table.</HI></P>
<P>The Mold of the&s;e I&s;lands for the bigge&s;t part is blacki&s;h, and pretty deep, only the Hills are &s;omewhat &s;tony. The Ea&s;tern part of the bigge&s;t I&s;land is &s;andy, yet all cloathed with Trees of di|vers &s;orts. The Trees do not grow &s;o thick as I have &s;een them in &s;ome Places, but they are gene|rally large and tall, and fit for any u&s;e.</P>
<P>There is one &s;ort of Tree much larger than any other on this I&s;land, and which I have not &s;een any where el&s;e. It is about 3 or 4 Foot Diameter in the Body, from whence is drawn a &s;ort of clam|my Juice, which being boiled a little becomes per|fect Tar; and if you boil it much it will become hard as Pitch. It may be put to either u&s;e; we
<PB N="391" REF="417">
u&s;ed it both ways, and found it to be very &s;ervice|able. The way that they get this Juice, is by cu|ting a great gap horizontally in the Body of the Tree half through, and about a Foot from the Ground; and then cutting the upper part of the Body a&s;lope inwardly downward, till in the mid|dle of the Tree it meet with the traver&s;e cutting or plain. In this plain horizontal &s;emicircular &s;tump, they make a hollow like a Ba&s;on, that may contain a Quart or two. Into this hole the Juice which drains from the wounded upper part of the Tree falls; from whence you mu&s;t empty it every day. It will run thus for &s;ome Months, and then dry away, and the Tree will recover again.</P>
<P>The Fruit-trees that Nature hath be&s;towed on the&s;e I&s;les are Mangoes; and Trees bearing a &s;ort of Grape, and other Trees bearing a kind of wild or ba&s;tard Nutmegs. The&s;e all grow wild in the Woods, and in very great plenty.</P>
<P>The Mangoes here grow on Trees as big as Ap|ple-trees: Tho&s;e at <HI>Fort St. George</HI> are not &s;o large. The Fruit of the&s;e is as big as a &s;mall Peach; but long and &s;maller towards the top: It is of a yellow|i&s;h colour when ripe; it is very juicy, and of a plea&s;ant &s;mell, and delicate ta&s;te. When the Mango is young they cut them in two pieces, and pickle them with Salt and Vinegar, in which they put &s;ome Cloves of Garlick. This is an excellent Sauce, and much e&s;teemed; it is called Mango-Achar. <HI>Achar</HI> I pre&s;ume &s;ignifies Sauce. They make in the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> e&s;pecially at <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Achar,</HI> as of the young tops of Bamboes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Bam|bo-Achar and Mango-Achar are mo&s;t u&s;ed. The Mangoes were ripe when we were there, (as were al&s;o the re&s;t of the&s;e Fruits) and they have then &s;o delicate a Fragrancy, that we could &s;mell them out in the thick Woods if we had but the wind of them, while we were a good way from them, and
<PB N="393" REF="418">
could not &s;ee them; and we generally found them out this way. Mangoes are common in many Places of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> but I did never know any grow wild only at this Place. The&s;e, though not &s;o big as tho&s;e I have &s;een at <HI>Achin</HI> and at <HI>Maderas</HI> or <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> are yet every whit as plea&s;ant as the be&s;t &s;ort of their Garden Mangoes.</P>
<P>The Grape-tree grows with a &s;trait Body, of a Diameter about a Foot or more, and hath but few Limbs or Boughs. The Fruit grows in Clu&s;ters, all about the Body of the Tree, like the Jack, Du|rian, and Cacao Fruits. There are of them both red and white. They are mueh like &s;uch Grapes as grow on our Vines, both in &s;hape and colour; and they are of a very plea&s;ant Winy ta&s;te. I never &s;aw the&s;e but on the two bigge&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands; the re&s;t had no Tar-trees, Mangoes, Grape-trees, nor Wild Nutmegs.</P>
<P>The Wild Nutmeg-tree is as big as a Walnut-tree; but it does not &s;pread &s;o much. The Boughs are gro&s;s, and the Fruit grows among the Boughs, as the Walnut, and other Fruits. This Nutmeg is much &s;maller than the true Nutmeg, and longer al&s;o. It is inclo&s;ed with a thin Shell, and a &s;ort of Mace, encircling the Nut, within the Shell. This ba&s;tard Nutmeg is &s;o much like the true Nutmeg in &s;hape, that at our fir&s;t arrival here we thought it to be the true one; but it has no manner of &s;mell nor ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Animals of the&s;e I&s;lands, are &s;ome Hogs, Lizards and Guanoes; and &s;ome of tho&s;e Crea|tures mentioned in Chap. XI. which are like, but much bigger than the Guano.</P>
<P>Here are many &s;orts of Birds, as Parrots, Para|kites, Doves and Pigeons. Here are al&s;o a &s;ort of wild Cocks and Hens: They are much like our tame Fowl of that kind; but a great deal le&s;s, for they are about the bigne&s;s of a Crow. The Cocks do
<PB N="393" REF="419">
crow like ours, but much more &s;mall and &s;hrill; and by their crowing we do fir&s;t find them out in the Woods, where we &s;hoot them. Their fle&s;h is very white and &s;weet.</P>
<P>There are a great many Limpits and Mu&s;cles, and plenty of green Turtle.</P>
<P>And upon this mention of Turtle again, I think it not ami&s;s to add &s;ome rea&s;ons to &s;trengthen the opinion that I have given concerning the&s;e Crea|tures removing from place to place. I have &s;aid in Chapter 5th, that they leave their common feeding places, and go to places a great way from thence to lay, as particularly to the I&s;land <HI>A&s;cention.</HI> Now I have di&s;cour&s;ed with &s;ome &s;ince that Subject was printed, who are of opinion, that when the lay|ing time is over, they never go from thence, but lye &s;omewhere in the Sea about the I&s;land, which I think is very improbable: for there can be no food for them there, as I could &s;oon make appear; as particularly from hence, that the Sea about the I&s;le of <HI>A&s;cention</HI> is &s;o deep as to admit of no ancho|ring but at one place, where there is no &s;ign of Gra&s;s: and we never bring up with our &s;ounding Lead any Gra&s;s or Weeds out of very deep Seas, but Sand, or the like, only. But if this be granted, that there is food for them, yet I have a great deal of rea&s;on to believe that the Turtle go from hence; for after the laying time you &s;hall never &s;ee them, and where-ever Turtle are, you will &s;ee them ri&s;e, and hold their Head above water to breath, once in 7 or 8 minutes, or at longe&s;t in 10 or 12. And if any Man does but con&s;ider, how Fi&s;h take their certain Sea&s;ons of the year to go from one Sea to another, this would not &s;eem &s;trange; even Fowls al&s;o having their &s;ea&s;ons to remove from one place to another.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are pretty well watered with &s;mall Brooks of fre&s;h Water, that run flu&s;h into
<PB N="394" REF="420">
the Sea for 10 Months in the Year. The latter end of <HI>March</HI> they begin to dry away, and in <HI>April</HI> you &s;hall have none in the Brooks, but what is lodged in deep Holes; but you my dig Wells in &s;ome places. In <HI>May,</HI> when the Rain comes, the Land is again repleni&s;hed with Water, and the Brooks run out into the Sea.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands lie very commodiou&s;ly in the way to and from <HI>Japan, China, Manila, Tunquin, Co|chinchina,</HI> and in general all this mo&s;t Ea&s;terly Coa&s;t of the <HI>Indian</HI> Continent; whether you go through the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> or the Streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> between <HI>Samatra</HI> and <HI>Java:</HI> and one of them you mu&s;t pa&s;s in the common way from <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> or other parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> unle&s;s you mean to fetch a great Compa&s;s round mo&s;t of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, as we did. Any Ship in di&s;tre&s;s may be refre&s;hed and recruited here very conveni|ently; and be&s;ides ordinary Accommodations, be furni&s;hed with Ma&s;ts, Yards, Pitch and Tar. It might al&s;o be a convenient place to u&s;her in a Commerce with the neighbouring Country of <HI>Co|chinchina;</HI> and Forts might be built to &s;ecure a Fa|ctory; particularly at the Harbour, which is capa|ble of being well fortified. This place therefore being upon all the&s;e Accounts &s;o valuable, and with|al &s;o little known, I have here in&s;erted a Draft of it, which I took during our &s;tay there.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this I&s;land are by Nation <HI>Cochinchine&s;e,</HI> as they told us, for one of them &s;pake good <HI>Malayan:</HI> which Language we learnt a &s;mat|tering of, and &s;ome of us &s;o as to &s;peak it pretty well, while we lay at <HI>Mindanao;</HI> and this is the com|mon Tongue of Trade and Commerce (though it be not in &s;everal of them the Native Language) in mo&s;t of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, being the <HI>Lingua Franca,</HI> as it were, of the&s;e Parts. I believe 'tis the vulgar Tongue at <HI>Malacca, Sumatra, Java,</HI> and
<PB N="395" REF="421">
<HI>Borneo;</HI> but at <HI>Celebes,</HI> the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and the Spice I&s;lands, it &s;eems borrowed for the carrying on of Trade.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Pulo Condore</HI> are but a &s;mall People in Stature, well enough &s;haped, and of a darker Colour than the <HI>Mindanayans.</HI> They are pretty long Vi&s;aged; their Hair is black and &s;treight, their Eyes are but &s;mall and black, their No&s;es of a mean bigne&s;s, and pretty high, their Lips thin, their Teeth white, and little Mouths. They are very civil People, but extraordinary poor. Their chiefe&s;t Employment is to draw the Juice of tho&s;e Trees that I have de&s;cribed, to make Tar. They pre&s;erve it in wooden Troughs; and when they have their Cargo, they tran&s;port it to <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> their Mother-Country. Some others of them em|ploy them&s;elves to catch Turtle, and boil up their Fat to Oil, which they al&s;o tran&s;port home. The&s;e People have great large Nets, with wide Ma&s;hes to catch the Turtle. The <HI>Jamaica</HI> Turtlers have &s;uch; and I did never &s;ee the like Nets but at <HI>Jamaica</HI> and here.</P>
<P>They are &s;o free of their Women, that they would bring them aboard, and offer them to us; and many of our Men hired them for a &s;mall mat|ter. This is a Cu&s;tom u&s;ed by &s;everal Nations in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> as at <HI>Pegu, Siam, Cochinchina,</HI> and <HI>Cambodia,</HI> as I have been told. It is u&s;ed at <HI>Tunquin</HI> al&s;o to my Knowledge; for I did afterwards make a Voyage thither, and mo&s;t of our Men had Women aboard all the time of our abode there. In <HI>Africa,</HI> al&s;o, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> our Merchants, Fa|ctors, and Seamen that re&s;ide there, have their black Mi&s;&s;es. It is accounted a piece of Policy to do it; for the chief Factors and Captains of Ships have the Great Mens Daughters offered them, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> or Noblemens at <HI>Tunquin,</HI> and even the King's Wives in <HI>Guinea;</HI> and by this &s;ort of Alliance
<PB N="396" REF="422">
the Country people are engaged to a greater Friend|&s;hip: And if there &s;hould ari&s;e any difference about Trade, or any thing el&s;e, which might provoke the Natives to &s;eek &s;ome treacherous Revenge, (to which all the&s;e Heathen Nations are very prone) then the&s;e <HI>Dalilahs</HI> would certainly declare it to their White Friends, and &s;o hinder their Country|mens De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The&s;e People are Idolaters: but their manner of Wor&s;hip I know not. There are a few &s;cattering Hou&s;es and Plantations on the great I&s;land, and a &s;mall Village an the South-&s;ide of it; where there is a little Idol Temple, and an Image of an Ele|phant, about 5 foot high, and in bigne&s;s proporti|onable, placed on one &s;ide of the Temple; and a Hor&s;e, not &s;o big, placed on the other &s;ide of it: both &s;tanding with thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heads towards the South. The Temple it &s;elf was low and ordinary, built of Wood, and thatched, like one of their Hou&s;es; which are but very meanly.</P>
<P>The Images of the Hor&s;e and the Elephant were the mo&s;t general Idols that I ob&s;erv'd in the Tem|ples of <HI>Tunquin,</HI> when I travell'd there. There were other Images al&s;o, of Bea&s;ts, Birds and Fi&s;h. I do not remember I &s;aw any Humane Shape there; nor any &s;uch mon&s;trous Repre&s;entations as I have &s;een among the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> Where-ever the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Sea|men or Merchants come (and they are very numerous all over the&s;e Seas) they have always hideous Idols on board their Jonks or Ships, with Altars, and Lamps burning before them. The&s;e Idols they bring a|&s;hore with them: And be&s;ide tho&s;e they have in common, every Man hath one in his own Hou&s;e. Upon &s;ome particular &s;olemn Days I have &s;een their <HI>Bonzies,</HI> or Prie&s;ts, bring whole Armfuls of painted Papers, and burn them with a great deal of Ceremony, being very careful to let no Piece e&s;cape them. The &s;ame Day they kill'd a Goat
<PB N="397" REF="423">
which had been purpo&s;ely fatting a Month before; this they offer or pre&s;ent before their Idol, and then dre&s;s it and fea&s;t them&s;elves with it. I have &s;een them do this in <HI>Tunquin,</HI> where I have at the &s;ame time been invited to their Fea&s;ts; and at <HI>Ban|couli,</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> they &s;ent a Shoulder of the &s;acrific'd Goat to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who eat of it, and ask'd me to do &s;o too; but I refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Maderas,</HI> or <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> I took notice of a great Ceremony u&s;ed for &s;everal Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the Idolaters inhabiting the Suburbs: Both Men and Women (the&s;e very well clad) in a great multitude went in &s;olemn Proce&s;&s;ion with lighted Torches, carrying their Idols about with them. I knew not the meaning of it. I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome went purpo&s;ely carrying Oyl to &s;prinkle into the Lamps, to make them burn the brighter. They began their Round about 11 a Clock at Night, and having paced it gravely about the Streets till 2 or 3 a Clock in the Morning, their Idols were carry'd with much Ceremony into the Temple by the Chief of the Proce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of the Women I &s;aw enter the Temple, particularly. Their Idols were different from tho&s;e of <HI>Tunquin, Cambodia,</HI> &amp;c. being in Humane Shape.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid already that we arrived at the&s;e I&s;lands the 14th day of <HI>March,</HI> 1687. The next day we &s;earched about for a place to careen in; and the 16th day we entred the Harbour, and imme|diately provided to careen. Some Men were &s;et to fell great Trees to &s;aw into Plank; others went to unrigging the Ship; &s;ome made a Hou&s;e to put our Goods in, and for the Sail-maker to work in. The Country People re&s;orted to us, and brought us of the Fruits of the I&s;land, with Hogs, and &s;ometimes Turtle; for which they received Rice in exchange, which we had a Ship-load of, taken at <HI>Manila.</HI> We bought of them al&s;o a good quantity of their
<PB N="398" REF="424">
pitchy Liquor, which we boiled, and u&s;ed about our Ship's bottom. We mixed it fir&s;t with Lime, which we made here; and it made an excellent Coat, and &s;tuck on very well.</P>
<P>We &s;taid in this Harbour from the 16th day of <HI>March</HI> till the 16th of <HI>April;</HI> in which time we made a new Suit of Sails of the Cloth that was ta|ken in the Prize. We cut a &s;pare Main-top-ma&s;t, and &s;awed Plank to &s;heath the Ship's Bottom; for &s;he was not &s;heathed all over at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and that old Plank that was left on then we now ript off, and clapt on new.</P>
<P>While we lay here 2 of our Men died, who were poi&s;on'd at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> they told us of it when they found them&s;elves poi&s;on'd, and had linger'd ever &s;ince. They were open'd by our Doctor, accord|ing to their own Reque&s;t before they died, and their Livers were black, light and dry, like pieces of Cork.</P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s being fini&s;hed here, we left the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prize taken at <HI>Manila,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Rice, taking out enough for our &s;elves; and on the 17th day we went from hence to the place where we fir&s;t anchored, on the North-&s;ide of the great I&s;land, purpo&s;ely to water; for there was a great Stream when we fir&s;t came to the I&s;land, and we thought it was &s;o now. But we found it dried up, only it &s;tood in Holes, 2 or 3 Hogsheads, or a Tun in a Hole: Therefore we did immediately cut Bamboos, and made Spouts, through which we conveyed the Water down to the Sea-&s;ide; by ta|king it up in Bowls, and pouring it into the&s;e Spouts or Troughs. We convey'd &s;ome of it thus near half a Mile. While we were filling our Wa|ter, Captain <HI>Read</HI> engaged an old Man, one of the Inhabitants of this I&s;land, the &s;ame, who, I &s;aid, could &s;peak the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language, to be his Pilot to the Bay of <HI>Siam;</HI> for he had often been telling
<PB N="399" REF="425">
us, that he was well acquainted there, and that he knew &s;ome I&s;lands there, where there were Fi&s;her|men lived, who he thought could &s;upply us with Salt-fi&s;h to eat at Sea; for we had nothing but Rice to eat. The Ea&s;terly Mon&s;oon was not yet done; therefore it was concluded to &s;pend &s;ome time there, and then take the advantage of the beginning of the We&s;tern Mon&s;oon, to return to <HI>Manila</HI> a|gain.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day of <HI>April</HI> 1687, we &s;ailed from <HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> directing our Cour&s;e W. by S. for the Bay of <HI>Siam.</HI> We had fair Weather, and a fine moderate Gale of Wind at E. N. E.</P>
<P>The 23d day we arriv'd at <HI>Pulo Ubi,</HI> or the I&s;land <HI>Ubi.</HI> This I&s;land is about 40 Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Pulo Condore;</HI> it lies ju&s;t at the entrance of the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> at the S. W. point of Land, that makes the Bay; namely, the point of <HI>Cambodia.</HI> This I&s;land is about 7 or 8 Leagues round, and it is high|er Land than any of <HI>Pulo Condore</HI> I&s;les. Again&s;t the South-Ea&s;t part of it there is a &s;mall Key, about a Cables length from the main I&s;land. This <HI>Pulo Ubi</HI> is very woody, and it has good Water on the North-&s;ide, where you may anchor; but the be&s;t anchoring is on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide again&s;t a &s;mall Bay; then you will have the little I&s;land to the Southward of you.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pulo Ubi</HI> we found two &s;mall Barks laden with Rice. They belonged to <HI>Cambodia,</HI> from whence they came not above two or three Days before, and they touched here to fill Water. Rice is the gene|ral Food of all the&s;e Countries, therefore it is tran&s;ported by Sea from one Country to another, as Corn in the&s;e parts of the World. For in &s;ome Coun|tries they produce more than enough for them&s;elves, and &s;end what they can &s;pare to tho&s;e places where there is but little.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="426">
The 24th Day we went into the Bay of <HI>Siam:</HI> This is a large deep Bay, of which and of this Kingdom I &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;peak but little, becau&s;e I de&s;ign a more particular account of all this Coa&s;t, to wit, of <HI>Tunquin, Cochinchina, Siam, Champa, Cam|bodia,</HI> and <HI>Malacca,</HI> making all the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly part of the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> lying <HI>South</HI> of <HI>China;</HI> but to do it in the Cour&s;e of this Voyage, would too mueh &s;well this Volume: and I &s;hall chu&s;e there|fore to give a &s;eparate Relation of what I know or have learnt of them, together with the neighbouring Parts of <HI>Sumatra, Jova,</HI> &amp;c. where I have &s;pent &s;ome time.</P>
<P>We run down into the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> till we came to the I&s;lands that our <HI>Pulo Condore</HI> Pilot told us of, which lie about the middle of the Bay: But as good a Pilot as he was, he run us aground,; yet we had no damage. Captain <HI>Read</HI> went a&s;hore at the&s;e I&s;lands, where he found a &s;mall Town of Fi&s;her|men; but they had no Fi&s;h to &s;ell, and &s;o we re|turned empty.</P>
<P>We had yet fair Weather, and very little Wind; &s;o that being often becalmed, we were till the 13th day of <HI>May</HI> before we got to <HI>Pulo Ubi</HI> again. There we found two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els at an Anchor on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide: They were laden with Rice and Laquer, which is u&s;ed in Japanning of Cabinets. One of the&s;e come from <HI>Champa,</HI> bound to the Town of <HI>Malacca,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who took it from the <HI>Portugueze:</HI> and this &s;hews that they have a Trade with <HI>Champa.</HI> This was a very pret|ty neat Ve&s;&s;el, her bottom very clean and curiou&s;ly coated; &s;he had about 40 Men all armed with Cor|tans, or broad Swords, Lances, and &s;ome Guns, that went with a Swivel upon their Gunnal. They were of the Idolaters, Natives of <HI>Champa,</HI> and &s;ome of the briske&s;t, mo&s;t &s;ociable, without fearfulne&s;s or &s;hyne&s;s, and the mo&s;t neat and dextrous about
<PB N="401" REF="427">
their Shipping, of any &s;uch I have met with in all my Travels. The other Ve&s;&s;el came from the Ri|ver of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and was bound towards the Streights of <HI>Malacca.</HI> Both of them &s;topt here, for the We&s;ter|ly Winds now began to blow, which were again&s;t them, being &s;omewhat bleated.</P>
<P>We anchored al&s;o on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, intending to fill Water. While we lay here we had very vio|lent Wind at S. W. and a &s;trong Current &s;etting right to Windward. The fiercer the Wind blew, the more &s;trong the Current &s;et again&s;t it. This Storm la&s;ted till the 20th day, and then it began to abate.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day of <HI>May</HI> we went back from hence towards <HI>Pulo Condore.</HI> In our way we overtook a great Jonk that came from <HI>Palimbam,</HI> a Town on the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra:</HI> She was full laden with Pep|per which they bought there, and was bound to <HI>Si|am:</HI> but it blowing &s;o hard, &s;he was afraid to ven|ture into that Bay, and therefore came to <HI>Pula Con|dore</HI> with us, where we both anchored <HI>May</HI> the 24th. This Ve&s;&s;el was of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> make, full of little Rooms or Partitions, like our Well-boats. I &s;hall de|&s;cribe them in the next Chapter. The Men of this Jonk told us, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;ettled on the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> at a place called <HI>Sillabar;</HI> and the fir&s;t knowledge we had that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had any &s;et|tlement on <HI>Sumatra</HI> was from the&s;e.</P>
<P>When we came to an Anchor, we &s;aw a &s;mall Bark at an Anchor near the Shore; therefore Cap|tain <HI>Read</HI> &s;ent a Canoa aboard her, to know from whence they came; and &s;uppo&s;ing that it was a <HI>Malaya</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, he ordered the Men not to go aboard, for they are accounted de&s;perate Fel|lows, and their Ve&s;&s;els are commonly full of Men, who all wear Cre&s;&s;ets, or little Daggers by their &s;ides. The Canoas Crew not minding the Captain's Orders went aboard, all but one Man that &s;tay'd in
<PB N="402" REF="428">
the Canoa. The <HI>Malayans,</HI> who were about 20 of them, &s;eeing our Men all armed, thought that they came to take their Ve&s;&s;el; therefore at once, on a Signal given, they drew out their Cre&s;&s;ets, and &s;tabbed 5 or 6 of our Men before they knew what the matter was. The re&s;t of our Men leapt over-board, &s;ome into the Canoa, and &s;ome into the Sea, and &s;o got away. Among the re&s;t, one <HI>Daniel Wal|lis</HI> leapt into the Sea, who could never &s;wim before nor &s;ince; yet now he &s;wam very well a good while before he was taken up. When the Canoas came aboard, Captain <HI>Read</HI> manned two Canoas, and went to be revenged on the <HI>Malayans;</HI> but they &s;eeing him coming, did cut a Hole in their Ve&s;&s;el's bottom, and went a&s;hore in their Boat. Capt. <HI>Read</HI> followed them, but they run into the Woods and hid them&s;elves. Here we &s;tay'd ten or eleven Days, for it blew very hard all the time. While we &s;tay'd here <HI>Herman Coppinger</HI> our Surgeon went a&s;hore, in|tending to live here; but Captain <HI>Read</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Men to fetch him again. I had the &s;ame Thoughts, and would have gone a&s;hore too, but waited for a more convenient place. For neither he nor I, when we were la&s;t on board at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> had any know|ledge of the Plot that was laid to leave Capt. <HI>Swan,</HI> and run away with the Ship; and being &s;ufficient|ly weary of this mad Crew, we were willing to give them the &s;lip at any place from whence we might hope to get a pa&s;&s;age to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory. There was nothing el&s;e of Moment happen'd while we &s;tay'd here.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving fill'd our Water, cut our Wood, and got our Ship in a Sailing po&s;ture, while the blu&s;tring hard Winds la&s;ted, we took the fir&s;t op|portunity of a &s;ettled Gale to Sail towards <HI>Manila.</HI> Accordingly <HI>June</HI> the 4th, 1687. we loo&s;ed from
<PB N="405" REF="431">
<HI>Pulo Condore,</HI> with the Wind at S. W. fair Weather at a brisk Gale. The <HI>Pepper</HI> Jonk bound to <HI>Siam</HI> remained there, waiting for an Ea&s;terly Wind; but one of his Men, a kind of a ba&s;tard <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> came aboard our Ship, and was entertained for the &s;ake of his knowledge in the &s;everal Languages of the&s;e Countries. The Wind continued in the S. W. but 24 hours, or a little more, and then came about to the North, and then to the N. E.; and the Sky became exceeding clear. Then the Wind came at Ea&s;t, and la&s;ted betwixt E. and S. E. for 8 or 10 Days. Yet we continued plying to Windward, expecting every Day a &s;hift of Wind, becau&s;e the&s;e Winds were not according to the Sea&s;on of the Year.</P>
<P>We were now afraid le&s;t the Currents might de|ceive us, and carry us on the Shoals of <HI>Pracel,</HI> which were near us, a little to the N. W. but we pa&s;&s;ed on to the Ea&s;tward, without &s;eeing any &s;ign of them; yet we were kept much to the Northward of our intended cour&s;e: and the Ea&s;terly Winds &s;till continuing, we de&s;paired of getting to <HI>Manila;</HI> and therefore began to project &s;ome new de&s;ign; and the re&s;ult was, to vi&s;it the I&s;land <HI>Prata,</HI> about the Lat. of 20 Deg. 40 Min. North; and not far from us at this time.</P>
<P>It is a &s;mall low I&s;land, environ'd with Rocks clear round it, by report. It lyeth &s;o in the way between <HI>Manila</HI> and <HI>Canton,</HI> the head of a Province, and a Town of great Trade in <HI>China,</HI> that the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> do dread the Rocks about it, more than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did formerly dread <HI>Bermudas;</HI> for many of their Jonks coming from <HI>Manila</HI> have been lo&s;t there, and with abundance of Trea&s;ure in them; as we were informed by all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that ever we conver&s;t with in the&s;e parts. They told us al&s;o, that in the&s;e Wrecks mo&s;t of the Men were drowned, and that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> did never go thi|ther
<PB N="406" REF="432">
to take upon any of the Trea&s;ure that was lo&s;t there, for fear of being lo&s;t them&s;elves. But the danger of the place did not daunt us; for we were re&s;olued to try our Fortunes there, if the Winds would permit; and we did beat for it 5 or 6 Days: but at la&s;t were forced to leave that De&s;ign al&s;o for want of Winds; for the S. E. Winds continuing, forced us on the Coa&s;t of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>It was the 25th Day of <HI>June</HI> when we made the Land; and running in towards the Shore we came to an Anchor the &s;ame Day, on the N. E. end of St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is in Lat. about 22 d. 30 min. North, lying on the S. Coa&s;t of the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> or <HI>Canton</HI> in <HI>China.</HI> It is of an indifferent heighth, and pretty plain, and the Soil fertile enough. It is partly woody, partly Savannahs or Pa&s;turage for Cattle; and there is &s;ome moi&s;t arable Land for Rice. The skirts or outer part of the I&s;land, e&s;pe|cially that part of it which borders on the main Sea, is woody: The middle part of it is good thick gra&s;&s;y Pa&s;ture, with &s;ome Groves of Trees; and that which is cultivated Land is low wet Land, yielding plentiful Crops of Rice; the only Grain that I did &s;ee here. The tame Cattel which this I&s;land affords, are <HI>China</HI> Hogs, Goats, Buffaloes, and &s;ome Bullocks. The Hogs of this I&s;land are all black; they have but &s;mall Heads, very &s;hort thick Necks, great Bellies, commonly touching the Ground, and &s;hort Legs. They Eat but little Food, yet they are mo&s;t of them very fat; probably be|cau&s;e they Sleep much. The tame Fowls are Ducks, and Cocks and Hens. I &s;aw no wild Fowl but a few &s;mall Birds.</P>
<P>The Natives of this I&s;land are <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> They are &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>China,</HI> and con&s;equently at this time to the <HI>Tartars.</HI> The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in general are tall, &s;trait-bodied, raw-boned Men. They
<PB N="407" REF="433">
are long Vi&s;aged, and their Foreheads are high; but they have little Eyes. Their No&s;es are pretty large, with a ri&s;ing in the middle. Their Mouths are of a mean &s;ize, pretty thin Lips. They are of an a&s;hy Complexion; their Hair is black, and their Beards thin and long, for they pluck the Hair out by the Roots, &s;uffering only &s;ome few very long &s;traggling Hairs to grow about their Chin in which they take great pride, often combing them, and &s;ometimes tying them up in a knot, and they have &s;uch Hairs too growing down from each &s;ide of their upper Lip like Whiskers. The ancient <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> were very proud of the Hair of their Heads, letting it grow very long, and &s;troking it back with their Hands curiou&s;ly, and then winding the plats all together round a Bodkin, thru&s;t through it at the hinder part of the Head; and both Men and Women did thus. But when the <HI>Tartars</HI> con|quer'd them, they broke them of this cu&s;tom they were fond of, by main force; in&s;omuch that they re&s;ented this Impo&s;ition wor&s;e than their &s;ubjecti|on, and rebelled upon it: but being &s;till wor&s;ted, were forc'd to acquie&s;ce; and to this day they follow the fa&s;hion of their Ma&s;ters the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and &s;have all their Heads, only re&s;erving one lock, which &s;ome tye up, others let it hang down to a great or &s;mall length as they plea&s;e. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in other Countries &s;till keep their old cu&s;tom, but if any of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> is found wearing long Hair in <HI>China,</HI> he forfeits his Head; and many of them have abandoned their Country to pre&s;erve their liberty of wearing their Hair, as I have been told by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have no Hats, Caps, or Turbans; but when they walk abroad, they carry a &s;mall Umbrello in their Hands, wherewith they fence their Head from the Sun or the Rain, by holding it over their Heads. If they walk but a little way,
<PB N="408" REF="434">
they carry only a large Fan made of Paper, or Silk, of the &s;ame fa&s;hion as tho&s;e our Ladies have, and many of them are brought over hither; one of the&s;e every Man carries in his Hand if he do but cro&s;s the Street, skreening his Head with it, if he hath not an Umbrello with him.</P>
<P>The common Apparel of the Men, is a loo&s;e Frock and Breeches. They &s;eldom were Stock|ings, but they have Shoes, or a &s;ort of Slippers ra|ther. The Mens Shoes are made diver&s;ly: The Women have very &s;mall Feet, and con&s;equently but little Shoes; for from their Infancy their Feet are kept &s;wathed up with Bands, as hard as they can po&s;&s;ibly endure them; and from the time they can go till they have done growing they bind them up every night. This they do purpo&s;ely to hin|der them from growing, e&s;teeming little Feet to be a great Beauty. But by this unrea&s;onable Cu&s;tom they do in a manner lo&s;e the u&s;e of their Feet, and in&s;tead of going they only &s;tumble about their Hou&s;es, and pre&s;ently &s;quat down on their Breeches again, being, as it were, con|fined to &s;itting all Days of their Lives. They &s;el|dom &s;tir abroad, and one would be apt to think, that, as &s;ome have conjectured, their keeping up their fondne&s;s for this Fa&s;hion were a Stratagem of the Mens, to keep them from gadding and go&s;&s;ip|ping about, and confine them at home. They are kept con&s;tantly to their work, being fine Needle-Women, and making many curious Embroideries, and they make their own Shoes; but if any Stran|ger be de&s;irous to bring away any for Novelty's &s;ake, he mu&s;t be a great Favourite to get a pair of Shoes, of them, though he give twice their value. The poorer &s;ort of Women trudge about Streets, and to the Market, without Shoes or Stockings; and the&s;e cannot afford to have little Feet, being to get their living with them.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="435">
The <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> both Men and Women, are very in|genious; as may appear by the many curious things that are brought from thence, e&s;pecially the <HI>Porce|laine,</HI> or <HI>China</HI> Earthen Ware. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Manila,</HI> that we took on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Luconia,</HI> told me, that this Commodity is made of Conch-&s;hells; the in&s;ide of which looks like Mother of Pearl. But the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> lately mentioned, who had lived in <HI>China,</HI> and &s;poke that and the neighbouring Lan|guages very well, &s;aid, That it was made of a fine &s;ort of Clay that was dug in the Province of <HI>Can|ton.</HI> I have often made enquiry about it, but could never be well &s;atisfied in it: But while I was on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Canton</HI> I forgot to inquire about it. They make very fine Lacquer-ware al&s;o, and good Silks; and they are curious at Painting and Carring.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> affords Drugs in great abundance; e&s;peci|ally <HI>China-Root;</HI> but this is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">culiar to that Country alone; for there is much of this Root growing at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> particularly at 16 <HI>mile walk,</HI> and in the Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> it is very plentiful. There is great &s;tore of Sugar made in this Coun|try; and Tea in abundance is brought from thence; being much u&s;ed there, and in <HI>Tunquin</HI> and <HI>Cochin|china</HI> as common drinking; Women &s;itting in the Streets, and &s;elling Di&s;hes of Tea hot and ready made; they call it <HI>Chau,</HI> and even the poore&s;t People &s;ip it. But the Tea at <HI>Tonqueen</HI> or <HI>Cochinchina</HI> &s;eems not &s;o good, or of &s;o plea&s;ant a bitter, or of &s;o fine a colour, or &s;uch virtue as this in <HI>China;</HI> for I have drank of it in the&s;e Countries: unle&s;s the fault be in their way of making it, for I made none there my &s;elf; and by the high red colour it looks as if they made a Decoction of it, or kept it &s;tale. Yet at <HI>Japan</HI> I was told there is a great deal of pure Tea, very good.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are very great Game&s;ters, and they will never be tired with it, playing night and day,
<PB N="410" REF="436">
till they have lo&s;t all their E&s;tates; then it is u&s;ual with them to hang them&s;elves. This was fre|quently done by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Factors at <HI>Manila,</HI> as I was told by <HI>Spaniards</HI> that lived there. The <HI>Spani|ards</HI> them&s;elves are much addicted to Gaming, and are very expert at it; but the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are too &s;ubtle for them, being in general a very cunning People.</P>
<P>But a particular Account of them and their Country would fill a Volume; nor doth my &s;hort Experience of them qualify me to &s;ay much of them. Wherefore I confine my &s;elf chiefly to what I ob&s;erv'd at St. <HI>John</HI>'s I&s;land, where we lay &s;ome time, and vi&s;ited the &s;hore every day to buy Provi&s;ion, as Hogs, Fowls, and Buffaloe. Here was a &s;mall Town &s;tanding in a wet &s;wampy Ground, with many filthy Ponds among&s;t the Hou&s;es, which were built on the Ground as ours are, not on Po&s;ts as at <HI>Mindanao.</HI> In the&s;e Ponds were plenty of Ducks; the Hou&s;es were &s;mall and low, and covered with Thatch, and the in&s;ide were but ill furni&s;hed, and kept na&s;tily: and I have been told by one who was there, that mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es in the City of <HI>Canton</HI> it &s;elf are but poor and irregular.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Village &s;eem to be mo&s;t Husbandmen: They were at this time very bu&s;y in Sowing their Rice which is their chiefe&s;t Com|modity. The Land in which they choo&s;e to Sow the Rice is low and wet, and when Plowed the Earth was like a ma&s;s of Mud. They plow their Land with a &s;mall Plow, drawn by one Buffaloe, and one Man both holds the Plow, and drives the Bea&s;t. When the Rice is ripe and gathered in, they tread it out of the Ear with Buffaloes, in a large round place made with a hard floor fit for that purpo&s;e, where they chain 3 or 4 of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, one at the tail of the other, and driving them round in a ring, as in a Hor&s;e-mill, they &s;o order
<PB N="411" REF="437">
it that the Buffaloes may tread upon it all.</P>
<P>I was once a&s;hore at this I&s;land, with 7 or 8 En|gli&s;h Men more, and having occa&s;ion to &s;tay &s;ome time, we killed a Shote, or young Porker, and roa&s;ted it for our Dinners. While we were bu&s;ie dre&s;&s;ing of our Pork, one of the Natives came and &s;at down by us; and when the Dinner was ready, we cut a good piece and gave it him, which he willingly received. But by Signs he begged more, and withal pointed into the Woods; yet we did not under&s;tand his meaning, nor much mind him, till our Hunger was pretty well a&s;&s;waged; although he did &s;till make Signs, and walking a little way from us, he beckoned to us to come to him; which at la&s;t I did, and 2 or 3 more. He going before, led the way in a &s;mall blind Path, through a Thicket, into a &s;mall Grove of Trees, in which there was an old Idol Temple about 10 foot &s;quare: The Walls of it were about 6 Foot high, and 2 Foot thick, made of Bricks. The Floor was paved with broad Bricks, and in the middle of the Floor &s;tood an old ru&s;ty Iron Bell on its Brims. This Bell was about two Foot high, &s;tanding flat on the Ground; the Brims on which it &s;tood were about 16 Inches diameter. From the brims it did taper away a lit|tle towards the Head, much like our Bells; but that the Brims did not turn out &s;o much as ours do. On the Head of the Bell there were 3 Iron Bars as big as a Man's Arm, and about 10 Inches long from the top of the Bell, where the ends join'd as in a Center, and &s;eemed of one Ma&s;s with the Bell, as if Ca&s;t toge|ther. The&s;e Bars &s;tood all Parallel to the Ground, and their further ends, which &s;tood Triangularly and opening from each other at equal Di&s;tances, like the Fliers of our Kitchen-Jacks, were made exactly in the &s;hape of the Paw of &s;ome mon|&s;trous Bea&s;t, having &s;harp Claws on it. This it &s;eems was their God; for as &s;oon as our zealous
<PB N="412" REF="438">
Guide came before the Bell, he fell flat on his Face and beckoned to us, &s;eeming very de&s;irous to have us do the like. At the inner &s;ide of the Temple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t the Walls, there was an Altar of white hewn Stone. The Table of the Altar was about 3 Foot long, 16 Inches broad, and 3 Inches thick It was rai&s;ed about two Foot from the Ground, and &s;upported by 3 &s;mall Pillars of the &s;ame white Stone. On this Altar there were &s;everal &s;mall Earthen Ve&s;&s;els; one of them was full of &s;mall Sticks that had been burned at one end. Our Guide made a great many Signs for us to fetch and to leave &s;ome of our Meat there, and &s;eemed very importunate, but we refu&s;ed. We left him there, and went aboard; I did &s;ee no other Tem|ple nor Idol here.</P>
<P>While we lay at this Place, we &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall <HI>China</HI> Jonks, Sailing in the <HI>Lagune</HI> between the I&s;lands and the Main, one came and anchored by us. I and &s;ome more of our Men went aboard to view her: She was built with a &s;quare flat Head as well as Stern, only the Head or fore-part was not &s;o broad as the Stern. On her Deck &s;he had little thacht Hou&s;es like Hovels, cover'd with Palmeto Leaves, and rai&s;ed about 3 Foot high, for the Sea|men to creep into. She had a pretty large Cabin, wherein there was an Altar and a Lamp burning, I did but ju&s;t look in, and &s;aw not the Idol. The Hold was divided in many &s;mall Partitions, all of them made &s;o tight, that if a Leak &s;hould Spring up in any one of them, it could go no farther, and &s;o could do but little Damage, but only to the Goods in the bottom of that Room where the Leak &s;prings up. Each of the&s;e Rooms belong to one or two Merchants, or more; and every Man freights his Goods in his own Room; and probably Lodges there, if he be on Board him&s;elf. The&s;e Jonks have only two Ma&s;ts, a Main-ma&s;t and a Fore-ma&s;t. The
<PB N="413" REF="439">
fore-ma&s;t has a &s;quare Yard and a &s;quare Sail, but the Main-ma&s;t has a Sail narrow aloft, like a Sloops-Sail, and in fair Weather they u&s;e a Top-&s;ail, which is to hale down on the Deck in foul weather, Yard and all; for they do not go up to furl it. The Main-ma&s;t in their bigge&s;t Jonks &s;eemed to me as big as any third-rate Man of Wars Ma&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> and yet not pieced as ours, but made of one grown Tree; and in all my Travels I never &s;aw any &s;ingle Tree-ma&s;ts &s;o big in the Body, and &s;o long, and yet &s;o well tapered, as I have &s;een in the <HI>Chine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> Jonks.</P>
<P>Some of our Men went over to a pretty large Town on the Continent of <HI>China,</HI> where we might have furni&s;hed our Selves with Provi&s;ion, which was a thing we were always in want of, and was our chief Bu&s;ine&s;s here; but we were afraid to lye in this Place any longer, for we had &s;ome &s;igns of an approaching Storm: this being the time of the Year in which Storms are expected on this Coa&s;t; and here was no &s;afe Riding. It was now the time of the Year for the S. W. Mon&s;oon, but the Wind had been whi&s;tling about from one part of the Compa&s;s to another for two or three Days, and &s;ometimes it would be quite calm. This cau&s;ed us to put to Sea, that we might have Sea-room at lea&s;t; for &s;uch flattering Weather is commonly the fore-runner of a Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly we weighed Anchor, and &s;et out; yet we had very little Wind all the next night. But the Day en&s;uing, which was the 4th day of <HI>July,</HI> about 4 a clock in the afternoon, the Wind came to the N. E. and fre&s;hned upon us, and the Sky look'd very black in that quarter, and the black Clouds began to ri&s;e apace and mov'd towards us; having hung all the morning in the Horizon. This made us take in our Top-&s;ails, and the Wind &s;till increa|&s;ing, about 9 a clock we rift our Main-&s;ail and Fore|&s;ail;
<PB N="414" REF="440">
at 10 we furl'd our Fore-&s;ail, keeping under a Main-&s;ail and Mizen. At 11 a clock we furl'd our Main-&s;ail, and balla&s;ted our Mizen; at which time it began to rain, and by 12 a clock at night it blew exceeding hard, and the Rain poured down as through a Sieve. It thundered and lightned pro|digiou&s;ly, and the Sea &s;eemed all of a Fire about us; for every Sea that broke &s;parkled like Light|ning. The violent Wind rai&s;ed the Sea pre&s;ently to a great heighth, and it ran very &s;hort, and be|gan to break in on our Deck. One Sea &s;truck a|way the Rails of our Head, and our Sheet-Anchor, which was &s;towed with one Flook or bending of the Iron, over the Ships Gunal, and la&s;ht very well down to the &s;ide, was violently wa&s;ht off, and had like to have &s;truck a hole in our Bow, as it lay beating again&s;t it. Then we were forced to put right before the Wind to &s;tow our Anchor again; which we did with much ado: but afterwards we dur&s;t not adventure to bring our Ship to the Wind again, for fear of foundring, for the turning the Ship either to or fro from the Wind is dangerous in &s;uch violent Storms. The fiercene&s;s of the Wea|ther continued till 4a clock that morning; in which time we did cut away two Canoas that were tow|ing a&s;tern.</P>
<P>After four a clock the Thunder and the Rain abated, and then we &s;aw a <HI>Corpus Sant</HI> at our Main-top-ma&s;t head, on the very top of the truck of the Spindle. This &s;ight rejoyc'd our Men exceedingly; for the heighth of the Storm is commonly over when the <HI>Corpus Sant</HI> is &s;een aloft; but when they are &s;een lying on the Deck, it is generally accounted a bad Sign.</P>
<P>A <HI>Corpus Sant</HI> is a certain &s;mall glittering light; when it appears as this did, on the very top of the Main-ma&s;t or at a Yard-arm, it is like a Star; but when it appears on the Deck, it re&s;embles a great Glow|worm.
<PB N="415" REF="441">
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have another Name for it, (though I take even this to be a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Name, and a corruption only of <HI>Corpus Sanctum</HI>) and I have been told that when they &s;ee them, they pre&s;ently go to Prayers, and ble&s;s them&s;elves for the happy &s;ight. I have heard &s;ome ignorant Sea|men di&s;cour&s;ing how they have &s;een them creep, or as they &s;ay, travel about in the Scuppers, telling many di&s;mal Stories that hapned at &s;uch times: but I did never &s;ee any one &s;tir out of the place where it was fir&s;t fixt, except upon Deck, where every Sea wa&s;heth it about: Neither did I ever &s;ee any but when we have had hard Rain as well as Wind; and therefore do believe it is &s;ome Jelly: but e|nough of this.</P>
<P>We continued &s;cudding right before Wind and Sea from 2 till 7 a Clock in the Morning, and then the Wind being much abated, we &s;et our Mizen again, and brought our Ship to the Wind, and lay under a Mizen till 11. Then it fell flat calm, and it continued &s;o for about 2 Hours: but the Sky looked very black and rueful, e&s;pecially in the S. W. and the Sea to&s;&s;ed us about like an Egg-&s;hell, for want of Wind. About one a Clock in the After|noon the Wind &s;prung up at S. W. out of the quar|ter from whence we did expect it: therefore, we pre&s;ently brail'd up our Mizen, and wore our Ship: but we had no &s;ooner put our Ship before the Wind, but it blew a Storm again, and rain'd very hard; though not &s;o violently as the Night before: but the Wind was altogether as boy&s;terous, and &s;o continued till 10 or 11 a Clock at Night. All which time we &s;cudded, or run before the Wind very &s;wift, tho' only with our bare Poles, that is, with|out any Sail abroad. Afterwards the Wind died away by degrees, and before Day we had but little Wind, and &s;ine clear Weather.</P>

N. called <HI>Pi&s;cadores.</HI> For there was not a Man aboard that was any thing acquaint|ed on the&s;e Coa&s;ts; and therefore all our depen|dance was on the Drafts, which only pointed out to us where &s;uch and &s;uch Places or I&s;lands were, without giving us any account, what Harbour, Roads, or Bays there were; or the Produce, Strength, or Trade of them: the&s;e we were forced to &s;eek after our &s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pi&s;cadores</HI> are a great many inhabited I&s;lands, lying near the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> between it and <HI>China,</HI> in or near the Lat. of 23 deg. N. Lat. almo&s;t as high as the Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Pi&s;cadore</HI> I&s;lands are moderately high, and appear much like our <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire-Downs</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> They produce thick &s;hort Gra&s;s, and a few Trees. They are pretty well watred, and they feed abundance of Goats, and &s;ome great Cattle. There are abun|dance of Mounts and old Fortifications on them:
<PB N="417" REF="443">
but of no u&s;e now, what-ever they have been.</P>
<P>Between the 2 Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;lands there is a very good Harbour, which is never without Jonks Ri|ding in it: And on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land there is a large Town and Fort commanding the Harbour. The Hou&s;es are but low, yet well built, and the Town makes a &s;ine Pro&s;pect. This is a Garri&s;on of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> wherein are al&s;o 3 or 400 Soldiers; who live here 3 years, and then they are remov'd to &s;ome other Place.</P>
<P>On the I&s;land, on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Har|bour, clo&s;e by the Sea, there is a &s;mall Town of <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and mo&s;t of the other I&s;lands have &s;ome <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> living on them, more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>Having, as I &s;aid before, concluded to go to the&s;e I&s;lands, we &s;teered away for them, having the Wind at W. S. W. a &s;mall gale. The 20th day of <HI>July</HI> we had fir&s;t &s;ight of them, and &s;teered in among them; finding no place to anchor in till we came into the Harbour before-mentioned. We blundering in, knowing little of our way, and we admired to &s;ee &s;o many Jonks going and coming, and &s;ome at an Anchor, and &s;o great a Town as the Neighbouring Ea&s;termo&s;t Town, the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Garri&s;on; for we did not expect, nor de&s;ire, to have &s;een any People, being in care to lie con|ceal'd in the&s;e Seas; however, &s;eeing we were here, we boldly run into the Harbour, and pre&s;ently &s;ent a&s;hore our Canoa to the Town.</P>
<P>Our People were met by an Officer at their Landing; and our Quarter-ma&s;ter, who was the chiefe&s;t Man in the Boat, was conducted before the Governour and examined, of what Nation we were, and what was our Bu&s;ine&s;s here. He an|&s;wer'd, That we were Engli&s;h, and were bound to <HI>Amoy,</HI> or <HI>Anhay,</HI> which is a City &s;tanding on a Na|vigable River in the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> and is a place of va&s;t Trade, there being a huge multi|tude
<PB N="418" REF="444">
of Ships there, and in general on all the&s;e Coa&s;ts, as I have heard of &s;everal that have been there. He &s;aid al&s;o, that having received &s;ome Damage by a Storm, we therefore put in here to refit, before we could adventure to go farther; and that we did intend to lie here till after the full Moon, for fear of another Storm. The Go|vernour told him, that we might better refit our Ship at <HI>Amoy</HI> than here, and that he heard that two Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;els were arrived there already; and that he &s;hould be very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in any thing; but we mu&s;t not expect to Trade there, but mu&s;t go to the places allowed to entertain Merchant-Strangers, which were <HI>Amoy</HI> and <HI>Macao. Macao</HI> is a Town of great Trade al&s;o, lying in an I&s;land at the very Mouth of the River of <HI>Canton.</HI> 'Tis fortified and garri&s;oned by a large <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Colony, but yet under the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Governour, who&s;e People inhabit one Moiety of the Town, and lay on the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> what Tax they plea&s;e; for they dare not di&s;oblige the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> for fear of lo&s;ing their Trade. However, the Governour very kindly told our Quarter-ma&s;ter, that what&s;oever we wanted, if that place could furni&s;h us, we &s;hould have it. Yet that we mu&s;t not come a&s;hore on that I&s;land, but he would &s;end aboard &s;ome of his Men, to know what we wanted, and they &s;hould al&s;o bring it off to us. That neverthele&s;s we might go on &s;hore on other I&s;lands to buy Refre&s;hments of the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> After the Di&s;cour&s;e was ended, the Governour di&s;mi&s;t him, with a &s;mall Jar of Flower, and 3 or 4 large Cakes of very fine Bread, and about a dozen Pine-Apples and Water-Melons (all very good in their kind) as a Pre&s;ent to the Captain.</P>
<P>The next day an eminent Officer came aboard, with a great many Attendants. He wore a black Silk Cap of a particular make, with a Plume of
<PB N="419" REF="445">
black and white Feathers, &s;tanding up almo&s;t round his Head behind, and all his out&s;ide Cloaths were black Silk, He had a loo&s;e black Coat, which reached to his Knees, and his Breeches were of the &s;ame; and underneath his Coat he had two Garments more, of other coloured Silk. His Legs were covered with &s;mall black limber Boots. All his Attendants were in a very hand&s;om garb of black Silk, all wearing tho&s;e &s;mall black Boots and Caps. The&s;e Caps were like the Crown of a Hat made of Palmeto-leaves, like our Straw-hats; but without brims, and coming down but to their Ears. The&s;e had no Feathers, but had an oblong Button on the top, and from between the Button and the Cap, there fell down all round their Head as low as the Cap reached, a &s;ort of cour&s;e Hair like Hor&s;e-hair, dyed (as I &s;uppo&s;e) of a light red colour.</P>
<P>The Officer brought aboard, as a pre&s;ent from the Governour, a young Heifer, the fatte&s;t and kindlie&s;t Beef, that I did ever ta&s;te in any Foreign Country: 'Twas &s;mall yet full grown; 2 large Hogs, 4 Goats, 2 Baskets of fine Flower, 20 great flat Cakes of fine well ta&s;ted Bread, 2 great Jars of Arack, (made of Rice as I judged) called by the <HI>Chine&s;e, Sam Shu;</HI> and 55 Jars of <HI>Hoc Shu,</HI> as they call it, and our <HI>Europeans</HI> from them. This is a &s;trong Liquor, made of Wheat as I have been told. It looks like Mum, and ta&s;tes much like it, and is very plea&s;ant and hearty. Our Seamen love it mightily, and will lick their Lips with it: for &s;carce a Ship goes to <HI>China,</HI> but the Men come home fat with &s;oaking this Liquor, and bring &s;tore of Jars of it home with them. It is put into &s;mall white thick Jars, that hold near a quart: The double Jars hold about two quarts. The&s;e Jars are &s;mall below, and thence ri&s;e up with a pretty full belly, clo&s;ing in pretty &s;hort at top, with a &s;mall thick mouth. Over
<PB N="420" REF="446">
the mouth of the Jar they put a thin Chip cut round, ju&s;t &s;o as to cover the mouth, over that a piece of Paper, ayd over that they put a great lump of Clay, almo&s;t as big as the Bottle or Jar it &s;elf, with a hollow in it, to admit the neck of the Bottle, made round, and about 4 inches long; this is to pre&s;erve the Liquor. If the Liquor take any vent it will be &s;owre pre&s;ently, &s;o that when we buy any of it, of the Ships from <HI>China</HI> returning to <HI>Maderas,</HI> or Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> where it is then &s;old, or o the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> them&s;elves, of whom I have bought it at <HI>Achin,</HI> and <HI>Bencouli</HI> in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> if the Clay be crackt, or the Liquor motherly, we make them take it again. A quart Jar there is worth Six-pence. Be&s;ides this Pre&s;ent from the Governor, there was a Captain of a Jonk &s;ent two Jars of <HI>Arack,</HI> and abundance of Pine-apples, and Water-melons.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Read</HI> &s;ent a&s;hore, as a Pre&s;ent to the Governor, a curious <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Silver-hilted Rapier, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Carbine, and a Gold Chain, and when the Officer went a&s;hore, three Guns were fired. In the Afternoon the Governour &s;ent off the &s;ame Officer again, to complement the Captain for his Civility, and promi&s;ed to retaliate his kindne&s;s before we departed; but we had &s;uch blu&s;tring Weather afterward, that no Boat could come a|board.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here till the 29th Day, and then &s;ailed from hence with the Wind at S. W. and pretty fair Weather. We now directed our cour&s;e for &s;ome I&s;lands we had cho&s;en to go to, that lye be|tween <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> and <HI>Luconia.</HI> They are laid down in our Plots without any name, only with a figure of 5, denoting the number of them. It was &s;up|po&s;ed by us, that the&s;e I&s;lands had no Inhabitants, becau&s;e they had not any name by our Hydrogra|phers. Therefore we thought to lye there &s;ecure, and be pretty near the I&s;land <HI>Luconia,</HI> which we did &s;till intend to vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="447">
In going to them we &s;ailed by the South We&s;t end of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> leaving it on our Larboard-&s;ide. This is a large I&s;land; the South-end is in Lat. 21 d. 20 m. and the North-end in the 25 d. 10 m. North Lat. the Longitude of this I&s;le is laid down from 142 d. 5 m. to 143 d. 16 m. reckoning Ea&s;t from the Pike of <HI>Tenariffe,</HI> &s;o that 'tis but narrow; and the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> cro&s;&s;es it. It is a High and Woody I&s;land, and was formerly well inhabited by the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and was then frequently vi&s;ited by Engli&s;h Mer|chants, there being a very good Harbour to &s;ecure their Ships. But &s;ince the <HI>Tartars</HI> have conquered <HI>China,</HI> they have &s;poiled the Harbour, (as I have been informed) to hinder the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> that were then in Rebellion, from Fortifying them&s;elves there; and ordered the Foreign Merchants to come and Trade on the Main.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day of <HI>August</HI> we arrived at the five I&s;lands that we were bound to, and anchored on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Northermo&s;t I&s;land, in 15 Fa|thom, a Cable's length from the Shore. Here, con|trary to our Expectation, we found abundance of Inhabitants in &s;ight; for there were 3 large Towns all within a League of the Sea; and another larger Town than any of the three, on the back&s;ide of a &s;mall Hill clo&s;e by al&s;o, as we found afterwards. The&s;e I&s;lands lie in Lat. 20 d. 20 m. North Lat. by my Ob&s;ervation, for I took it there, and I find their Longitude according to our Drafts, to be 141 d. 50 m. The&s;e I&s;lands having no particular Names in the Drafts, &s;ome or other of us made u&s;e of the Seamens priviledge, to give them what Names we plea&s;ed. Three of the I&s;lands were pretty large; the We&s;termo&s;t is the bigge&s;t. This the Dutchmen who were among us called the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s I&s;land, in honour of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty. It is about 7 or 8 Leagues long, and about two Leagues wide; and it lies almo&s;t N. and S.
<PB N="422" REF="448">
The other two great I&s;lands are about 4 or 5 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of this. The Northermo&s;t of them, where we fir&s;t anchored, I called the Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI>'s I&s;le, as &s;oon as we landed on it; ha|ving married my Wfe out of his Dutche&s;s's Fami|ly, and leaving her at <HI>Arlington-hou&s;e,</HI> at my going Abroad. This I&s;le is about 4 Leagues long, and one League and a half wide, &s;tretching North and South. The other great I&s;land onr Seamen called the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s I&s;land. This is about a League to the Southward of <HI>Grafton</HI> I&s;le. It is about 3 Leagues long, and a League wide, lying as the other. Between <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the South end of <HI>Orange</HI> I&s;land, there are two &s;mall I&s;lands of a roundi&s;h Form, lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t. The Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t I&s;land of the two, our Men unanimou&s;ly cal|led <HI>Bo&s;hee</HI> I&s;land, from a Liquor which we drank there plentifully every day, after we came to an Anchor at it. The other, which is the &s;malle&s;t of all, we called <HI>Goat</HI> I&s;land, from the great num|ber of Goats there; and to the Northward of them all, are two high Rocks.</P>
<P><HI>Orange</HI> I&s;land, which is the bigge&s;t of them all, is not Inhabited. It is high Land, flat and even on the top, with &s;teep Cliffs again&s;t the Sea; for which-Rea&s;on we could not go a&s;hore there, as we did on all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I have made it my general Ob&s;ervation, That where the Land is fenced with &s;teep Rocks and Cliffs again&s;t the Sea, there the Sea is very deep, and &s;eldom affords Anchor-ground; and on the other &s;ide where the Land falls away with a de|clivity into the Sea, (altho' the Land be extraordi|nary high within,) yet there are commonly good Soundings, and con&s;equently Anchoring; and as the vi&s;ible declivity of the Land appears near, or at the edge of the Water, whether pretty &s;teep, or more &s;toping, &s;o we commonly find our Anchor|ground
<PB N="423" REF="449">
to be, more or le&s;s deep or &s;teep; there|fore we come nearer the Shore, or anchor farther off, as we &s;ee convenient; for there is no Coa&s;t in the World, that I know, or have heard of, where the Land is of a continual heighth, without &s;ome &s;mall Valleys or Declivities, which lye inter|mixt with the high Land. They are the &s;ub&s;i|dings of Valleys or low Lands, that make Dents in the Shore and Creeks, &s;mall Bays, and Harbours, or little Coves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which afford good anchoring, the &s;urface of the Earth being there lodged deep under Water. Thus we find many good Harbours on &s;uch Coa&s;ts, where the Land bounds the Sea with &s;teep Cliffs, by rea&s;on of the Declivities, or &s;ub&s;iding of the Land between the&s;e Cliffs: But where the Declen&s;ion from the Hills, or Cliffs, is not within Land, between Hill and Hill, but, as on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> the Declivity is to|ward the Main Sea, or into it, the Coa&s;t being perpendicular, or very &s;teep from the neighbouring Hills, as in tho&s;e Countries from the <HI>Andes,</HI> that run along the Shore, <HI>there</HI> is a deep Sea, and few or no Harbours, or Creeks. All that Coa&s;t is too &s;teep for anchoring, and hath the fewe&s;t Roads &s;it for Ships of any Coa&s;t I know, The Coa&s;ts of <HI>Gallicia, Portugal, Norway</HI> and <HI>New&s;oundland,</HI> &amp;c. are Coa&s;ts like the <HI>Peruvian,</HI> and the high I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> but yet not &s;o &s;canty of good Harbours; for where there are &s;hort Ridges of Land, there are good Bays at the extremities of tho&s;e Ridges, where they plunge into the Sea; as on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccos,</HI> &amp;c. The I&s;land of <HI>John Fernando,</HI> and the I&s;land St. <HI>Helena,</HI> &amp;c. are &s;uch high Land with deep Shore: and in general, the plunging of any Land under Water, &s;eems to be in proportion to the ri&s;ing of its continuous part above Water, more or le&s;s &s;teep; and it mu&s;t be a bottom almo&s;t level, or very gently declining,
<PB N="424" REF="450">
that affords good Anchoring, Ships being &s;oon driven from their Moorings on a &s;teep Bank; Therefore we never &s;trive to anchor where we &s;ee the Land high, and bounding the Sea with &s;teep Cliffs; and for this rea&s;on, when we came in &s;ight of <HI>States</HI> I&s;land near <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> before we entred into the South Seas, we did not &s;o much as think of anchoring after we &s;aw what Land it was, becau&s;e of the &s;teep Cliffs which appeared a|gain&s;t the Sea: Yet there might be little Harbours or Coves for Shallops, or the like, to anchor in, which we did not &s;ee or &s;earch after.</P>
<P>As high &s;teep Cliffs bounding on the Sea have this ill con&s;equence, that they &s;eldom afford an|choring; &s;o they have this benefit, that we can &s;ee them far off, and &s;ail clo&s;e to them, without dan|ger: for which rea&s;on we call them Bold Shores; whereas low Land, on the contrary, is &s;een but a little way, and in many places we dare not come near it, for fear of running aground before we &s;ee it. Be&s;ides, there are in many places Shoals thrown out by the cour&s;e of great Rivers, that from the low Land fall into the Sea.</P>
<P>This which I have &s;aid, that there is u&s;ually good anchoring near low Lands, may be illu&s;tra|ted by &s;everal In&s;tances. Thus on the South &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> there is mo&s;tly low Land, and there al&s;o is good anchoring all along Shore; and in &s;ome Places to the Ea&s;tward of the Town of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> we &s;hall have &s;o many Fathom as we are Leagues off from Land; that is, from 9 or 10 Leagues di&s;tance, till you come within 4 Leagues: and from thence to Land it grows but &s;hallower. The Bay of <HI>Honduras</HI> al&s;o is low Land, and con|tinues mo&s;tly &s;o, as we pa&s;t along from thence to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Portobel,</HI> and <HI>Cartagena,</HI> till we came as high as <HI>Santa Martha;</HI> afterwards the Land is low again, till you come towards the Coa&s;t of
<PB N="425" REF="451">
<HI>Caraccos,</HI> which is a high Coa&s;t and bold Shore. The Land about <HI>Surinam</HI> on the &s;ame Coa&s;t is low and good anchoring, and that over on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> is &s;uch al&s;o. And &s;uch too is the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> where the Pilot-Book orders the Pilot always to &s;ound, and not to come within &s;uch a depth, be it by Night or Day. In the &s;ame Seas, from the high Land of <HI>Guitimala</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>California,</HI> there is mo&s;tly low Land and good An|choring. In the Main of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Bengal,</HI> and all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and the Coa&s;t about <HI>Malacca,</HI> and a|gain&s;t it the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> on that &s;ide, are mo&s;t|ly low anchoring Shores. But on the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> the Shore is high and bold; &s;o mo&s;t of the I&s;lands lying to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> as the I&s;lands <HI>Borneo, Celebes, Gilolo,</HI> and abundance of I&s;lands of le&s;s note, lying &s;cattering up and down tho&s;e Seas, are low Land and have good anchoring about them, with many Shoals &s;cattered to and fro among them; but the I&s;lands lying again&s;t the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Ocean, e&s;pecially the We&s;t-&s;ides of them, are high Land and &s;teep, particularly the We&s;t-parts, not only of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> but al&s;o of <HI>Java, Timer, &amp;c.</HI> Particulars are endle&s;s; but in general, 'tis &s;eldom but high Shores and deep Wa|ters; and on the other &s;ide, low Land and &s;hallow Seas, are found together.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion, to &s;peak of the re&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands. <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Grafton</HI> I&s;les are very hilly, with many of tho&s;e &s;teep in|habited Precipies on them, that I &s;hall de&s;cribe particularly. The two &s;mall I&s;lands are flat and even; only the <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;land hath one &s;teep &s;crag|gy Hill, but <HI>Goat</HI> I&s;land is all flat and very e|ven.</P>
<P>The Mold of the&s;e I&s;lands in the Valley, is blacki&s;h in &s;ome places, but in mo&s;t red. The
<PB N="426" REF="452">
Hills are very rocky: The Valleys are well wa|tered with Brooks of fre&s;h Water, which run into the Sea in many different places. The Soil is in|different fruitful, e&s;pecially in the Valleys; pro|ducing pretty great plenty of Trees (tho' not very big) and thick Gra&s;s. The &s;ides of the Mountains have al&s;o &s;hort Gra&s;s; and &s;ome of the Mountains have Mines within them, for the Natives told us, That the yellow Metal they &s;hewed us, (as I &s;hall &s;peak more particularly) came from the&s;e Moun|tains; for when they held it up they would point towards them.</P>
<P>The Fruit of the I&s;lands are a few Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-apples, Pumkins, Sugar-canes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there might be more if the Natives would, for the Ground &s;eems fertile enough. Here are great plenty of Potatoes, and Yames, which is the com|mon Food for the Natives, for Bread-kind: For tho&s;e few Plantains they have, are only u&s;ed as Fruit. They have &s;ome Cotton growing here of the &s;mall Plants.</P>
<P>Here are plenty of Goats, and abundance of Hogs; but few Fowls, either wild or tame. For this I have always ob&s;erved in my Travels, both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> that in tho&s;e Places where there is plenty of Grain, that is, of Rice in one, and Maiz in the other, there are al&s;o found great abundance of Fowls; but on the contrary, few Fowls in tho&s;e Countries where the Inhabitants feed on Fruits and Roots only. The few wild Fowls that are here, are Parakites, and &s;ome other &s;mall Birds. Their tame Fowl are only a few Cocks and Hens.</P>
<P><HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Grafton</HI> I&s;lands are very thick in|habited; and <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;land hath one Town on it. The Natives of the&s;e I&s;lands are &s;hort &s;quat People; they are generally round vi&s;aged, with low Fore-heads, and thick Eye-brows; their Eyes of a ha|zel
<PB N="427" REF="453">
colour, and &s;mall, yet bigger than the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> &s;hort low No&s;es, and their Lip and Mouths middle proportioned, Their Teeth are white; their Hair is black, and thick, and lank, which they wear but &s;hort; it will ju&s;t cover their Ears, and &s;o it is cut round very even. Their Skins are of a very dark copper colour.</P>
<P>They wear no Hat, Cap, nor Turbat, nor any thing to keep off the Sun. The Men for the bigge&s;t part have only a &s;mall Clout to cover their Naked|ne&s;s; &s;ome of them have Jackets made of Plantain|leaves, which were as rough as any Bear's-skin: I never &s;aw &s;uch rugged Things. The Women have a &s;hort Petticoat made of Cotton, which comes a little below their Knees. It is a thick &s;ort of &s;tubborn Cloth, which they make them&s;elves of their Cotton. Both Men and Women do wear large Ear-rings, made of that yellow Metal before mentioned. Whether it were Gold or no I cannot po&s;itively &s;ay: I took it to be &s;o, it was heavy, and of the colour of our paler Gold. I would fain have brought away &s;ome to have &s;atisfied my Curio&s;ity; but I had nothing wherewith to buy any. Captain <HI>Read</HI> bought two of the&s;e Rings with &s;ome Iron, of which the People are very greedy; and he would have bought more, thinking he was come to a very fair Market, but that the palene&s;s of the Metal made him and his Crew di&s;tru&s;t its being right Gold. For my part, I &s;hould have ventured on the purcha&s;e of &s;ome, but having no property in the Iron, of which we had great &s;tore on board, &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> by the Merchants along with Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> I dur&s;t not barter it away.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rings when fir&s;t poli&s;hed look very glo|riou&s;ly, but time makes them fade, and turn to a pale yellow. Then they make a &s;oft Pa&s;te of red Earth, and &s;mearing it over their Rings, they ca&s;t them into a quick Fire, where they remain till they
<PB N="428" REF="454">
be red hot; then they take them out and cool them in Water, and rub off the Pa&s;t; and they look again of a glorious Colour and Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The&s;e People make but &s;mall low Hou&s;es. The &s;ides which are made of &s;mall Po&s;ts, watled with Boughs, are not above 4 foot and a half high: the Ridge-pole is about 7 or 8 foot high. They have a Fire-place at one end of their Hou&s;es, and Boards placed on the Ground to lye on. They inhabit to|gether in &s;mall Villages built on the &s;ides and tops of rocky Hills, 3 or 4 rows of Hou&s;es one a|bove another, and on &s;uch &s;teep Precipices, that they go up to the fir&s;t Row with a wooden Ladder, and &s;o with a Ladder &s;till from every Story up to that above it, there being no way to a&s;cend. The Plain on the fir&s;t Precipice may be &s;o wide, as to have room both for a Row of Hou&s;es that &s;tand all along on the Edge or Brink of it, and a very narrow Street running along before their Doors, between the Row of Hou&s;es and the foot of the next Preci|pice; the Plain of which is in a manner level to the tops of the Hou&s;es below, and &s;o for the re&s;t. The common Ladder to each Row or Street comes up at a narrow Pa&s;&s;age left purpo&s;ely about the middle of it; and the Street being bounded with a Precipice al&s;o at each end, 'tis but drawing up the Ladder, if they be a&s;&s;aulted, and then there is no coming at them from below, but by climbing up as again&s;t a perpindicular Wall: And that they may not be a&s;&s;aulted from above, they take care to build on the &s;ide of &s;uch a Hill, who&s;e back&s;ide hangs over the Sea, or is &s;ome high, &s;teep, per|pendicular Precipice, altogether inacce&s;&s;ible. The&s;e Precipices are natural; for the Rocks &s;eem too hard to work on; nor is there any &s;ign that Art hath been employed about them. On <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;land there is one &s;uch, and built upon, with its back next the Sea. <HI>Grafton</HI> and <HI>Monmouth</HI> I&s;les are very
<PB N="429" REF="455">
thick &s;et with the&s;e Hills and Towns; and the Natives, whether for fear of Pirates, or Foreign Enemies, or Factions among their own Clans, care not for Building but in the&s;e Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es; which I take to be the Rea&s;on that <HI>Orange</HI> I&s;le, though the large&s;t, and as Fertile as any, yet being Level, and expo&s;ed, hath no Inhabitants. I never &s;aw the like Precipices and Towns.</P>
<P>The&s;e People are pretty Ingenious al&s;o in build|ing Boats. Their &s;mall Boats are much like our <HI>Deal</HI> Yalls, but not &s;o big; and they are built with very narrow Plank, pinn'd with wooden Pins, and &s;ome Nails. They have al&s;o &s;ome pretty large Boats, which will carry 40 or 50 Men. The&s;e they Row with 12 or 14 Oars of a &s;ide. They are built much like the &s;mall ones, and they Row dou|bled Banked; that is, two Men &s;etting on one Bench, but one Rowing on one &s;ide, the other on the other &s;ide of the Boat. They under&s;tand the u&s;e of Iron, and work it them&s;elves. Their Bel|lows are like tho&s;e at <HI>Mindanao.</HI></P>
<P>The common Imployment for the Men is Fi&s;h|ing; but I did never &s;ee them catch much: Whe|ther it is more plenty at other times of the Year I know not. The Women do manage their Planta|tions.</P>
<P>I did never &s;ee them kill any of their Goats or Hogs for them&s;elves, yet they would beg the Panches of the Goats that they them&s;elves did &s;ell to us: And if any of our &s;urly Seamen did heave them into the Sea, they would take them up again and the Skins of the Goats al&s;o. They would not meddle with Hogs-guts, if our Men threw away any be&s;ide what they made Chitterlings and Sau&s;ages of. The Goat-skins the&s;e People would carry a&s;hore, and making a Fire they would &s;inge off all the Hair, and afterwards let the Skin lie and Pearch on the Coals, till they thought it eatable; and then they
<PB N="430" REF="456">
would knaw it, and tear it in pieces with their Teeth, and at la&s;t &s;wallow it. The Paunches of the Goats would make them an excellent Di&s;h; they dre&s;t it in this manner. They would turn out all the chopt Gra&s;s and Crudities found in the Maw in|to their Pots, and &s;et it over the Fire, and &s;tir it about often: This would Smoak and Puff, and heave up as it was Boyling; wind breaking out of the Ferment, and making a very &s;avory Stink. While this was doing, if they had any Fi&s;h, as com|monly they had 2 or 3 &s;mall Fi&s;h, the&s;e they would make very clean (as hating Na&s;tine&s;s belike) and cut the Fle&s;h from the Bone, and then mince the Fle&s;h as &s;mall as po&s;&s;ibly they could, and when that in the Pot was well boiled, they would take it up, and &s;trewing a little Salt into it, they would eat it, mixt with their raw minced Fle&s;h. The Dung in the Maw would look like &s;o much boil'd Herbs mine'd very &s;mall; and they took up their Me&s;s with their Fingers, as the <HI>Moors</HI> do their Pilaw, u&s;ing no Spoons.</P>
<P>They had another Di&s;h made of a &s;ort of Locu&s;ts, who&s;e Bodies were about an Inch and an half long, and as thick as the top of one's little Finger; with large thin Wings, and long and &s;mall Legs. At this time of the Year the&s;e Creatures came in great Swarms to devour their Potato-leaves, and other Herbs; and the Natives would go out with &s;mall Nets, and take a Quart at one &s;weep. When they had enough, they would carry them home, and Parch them over the Fire in an earthen Pan; and then their Wings and Legs would fall off, and their Heads and Backs would turn red like boil'd Shrimps, being before browni&s;h. Their Bodies being full, would eat very moi&s;t, their Heads would crackle in one's Teeth. I did once eat of this Di&s;h, and liked it well enough; but their other Di&s;h my Stomach would not take.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="457">
Their common Drink is Water; as it is of all other <HI>Indians:</HI> Be&s;ide which they make a &s;ort of Drink with the Juice of the Sugar-cane, which they boil, and put &s;ome &s;mall black &s;ort of Berries among it. When it is well boiled, they put it into great Jars, and let it &s;tand 3 or 4 days and work. Then it &s;ettles, and becomes clear, and is pre&s;ent|ly fit to drink. This is an excellent Liquor, and very much like <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer, both in Colour and Ta&s;te. It is very &s;trong, and I do believe very whole&s;ome: For our Men, who drank briskly of it all day for &s;everal Weeks, were frequently drunk with it, and never &s;ick after it. The Natives brought a va&s;t deal of it every day to tho&s;e aboard and a&s;hore: For &s;ome of our Men were a&s;hore at work on <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;land; which I&s;land they gave that Name to from their drinking this Liquor there; that be|ing the Name which the Natives call'd this Liquor by: and as they &s;old it to our Men very cheap, &s;o they did not &s;pare to drink it as freely. And in|deed from the plenty of this Liquor, and their plentiful u&s;e of it, our Men call'd all the&s;e I&s;lands, the <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>What Language the&s;e People do &s;peak I know not: for it had no affinity in &s;ound to the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> which is &s;poke much through the Teeth; nor yet to the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language. They called the Metal that their Ear-rings were made of <HI>Bullawan,</HI> which is the <HI>Mindana</HI> word for Gold; therefore propably they may be related to the <HI>Philippine Indians;</HI> for that is the general Name for Gold among all tho&s;e <HI>Indians.</HI> I could not learn from whence they have their Iron; but it is mo&s;t likely they go in their great Boats to the North end of <HI>Luconia,</HI> and Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> of that I&s;land for it. Neither did I &s;ee any thing be&s;ide Iron, and pieces of Buffaloes Hides, which I could judge that they bought of Strangers: Their Cloaths were of their own Growth and Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="458">
The&s;e Men had Wooden Lances, and a few Lances headed with Iron; which are all the Wea+pons that they have. Their Armour is a piece o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Buffaloe-hide, &s;haped like our Carters Frocks, being without Sleeves, and &s;owed both &s;ides together, with holes for the Head and the Arms to come forth. This Buff-Coat reaches down to their Knees: It is clo&s;e about their Shoulders, but below it is 3 Foot wide, and as thick as a Board.</P>
<P>I could never perceive them to Wor&s;hip any thing, neither had they any Idols; neither did they &s;eem to ob&s;erve any one day more than other. I could never perceive that one Man was of greater Power than another; but they &s;eemed to be all equal; only every Man Ruling in his own Hou&s;e, and the Children Re&s;pecting and Honouring their Parents.</P>
<P>Yet 'tis probable that they have &s;ome Law, or Cu&s;tom, by which they are govern'd; for while we lay here we &s;aw a young Man buried alive in the Earth; and 'twas for Theft, as far as we could under&s;tand from them. There was a great deep hole dug, and abundance of People came to the Place to take their la&s;t Farewell of him: Among the re&s;t, there was one Woman who made great Lamentation, and took off the condemn'd Per&s;on's Ear-rings. We &s;uppo&s;ed her to be his Mother. After he had taken his leave of her and &s;ome others, he was put into the Pit, and covered over with Earth. He did not &s;truggle, but yielded very qui|etly to his Puni&s;hment; and they cramm'd the Earth clo&s;e upon him, and &s;tifled him.</P>
<P>They have but one Wife, with whom they live and agree very well; and their Children live very Obediently under them. The Boys go out a Fi&s;h|ing with their Fathers; and the Girles live at home with their Mothers: And when the Girles are grown pretty &s;trong, they &s;end them to their Plantations,
<PB N="433" REF="459">
to dig Hames and Potatoes; of which they bring home on their Heads every day enough to &s;erve the whole Family; for they have no Rice nor Maize.</P>
<P>Their Plantations are in the Valleys, at a good di&s;tance from their Hou&s;es; where every Man has a certain &s;pot of Land, which is properly his own. This he manageth him&s;elf for his own u&s;e; and provides enough, that he may not be beholding to his Neighbour.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming na&s;tine&s;s of their Di&s;h of Goats Maw, they are in their Per&s;ons a very neat cleanly People, both Men and Women: And they are withal the quiete&s;t and civile&s;t People that I did ever meet with. I could never perceive them to be angry with one another. I have admired to &s;ee 20 or 30 Boats aboard our Ship at a time, and yet no difference among them; but all civil and quiet, endeavouring to help each other on occa&s;i|on: No noi&s;e, nor appearance of di&s;ta&s;te: and al|though &s;ometimes cro&s;s Accidents would happen, which might have &s;et other Men together by the Ears, yet they were not moved by them. Some|times they will al&s;o drink freely, and warm them|&s;elves with their Drink; yet neither then could I ever perceive them out of Humour. They are not only thus civil among them&s;elves, but very obliging and kind to Strangers; nor were their Children rude to us, as is u&s;ual. Indeed the Women, when we came to their Hou&s;es, would mode&s;ty beg any Rags, or &s;mall pieces of Cloth, to &s;waddle their young ones in, holding out their Children to us; and begging is u&s;ual among all the&s;e wild Nations. Yet neither did they beg &s;o importunely as in other Places; nor did the Men ever beg any thing at all. Neither, except once at the fir&s;t time that we came to an Anchor (as I &s;hall relate) did they &s;teal any thing; but dealt ju&s;tly, and with great &s;incerity with us; and make us very welcome to
<PB N="434" REF="460">
their Hou&s;es with <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> drink. If they had none of this Liquor them&s;elves, they would buy a Jar of Drink of their Neighbours, and &s;it down with us: for we could &s;ee them go and give a piece or two of their Gold for &s;ome Jars of <HI>Ba&s;hee.</HI> And indeed among Wild <HI>Indians,</HI> as the&s;e &s;eem to be, I wonder'd to &s;ee buying and &s;elling, which is not &s;o u&s;ual; nor to conver&s;e &s;o freely, as to go aboard Stranger's Ships with &s;o little caution: Yet their own &s;mall Trading may have brought them to this. At the&s;e Entertainments, they and their Family, Wife and Children drank out of &s;mall Callaba&s;hes: and when by them&s;elves, they drink about from one to another; but when any of us came among them, then they would always drink to one of us.</P>
<P>They have no &s;ort of Coin; but they have &s;mall Crumbs of the Metal before de&s;cribed, which they bind up very &s;afe in Plantain Leaves, or the like. This Metal they exchange for what they want, giving a &s;mall quantity of it, about 2 or 3 Grains, for a Jar of Drink, that would hold 5 or 6 Gallons. They have no Scales, but give it by gue&s;s. Thus much in general.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore with our Affairs, I have &s;aid before, that we anchored here the 6th day of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> While we were furling our Sails, there came near 100 Boats of the Natives aboard, with 3 or 4 Men in each; &s;o that our Deck was full of Men. We were at fir&s;t afraid of them, and there|fore got up 20 or 30 &s;mall Arms on our Poop, and kept 3 or 4 Men as Centinels, with Guns in their Hands, ready to fire on them if they had offered to mole&s;t us. But they were pretty quiet, only they pickt up &s;uch old Iron that they found on our Deck, and they al&s;o took out our Pump-Bolts, and Linch-Pins out of the Carriages of our Guns, before we perceived them. At la&s;t, one of our Men per|ceived
<PB N="435" REF="461">
one of them very bu&s;ie getting out one of our Linch Pins; and took hold of the fellow, who immediately bawl'd out, and all the re&s;t pre&s;ently leaped over-board, &s;ome into their Boats, others into the Sea; and they all made away for the Shore. But when we perceived their Fright, we made much of him that was in hold, who &s;tood Trembling all the while; and at la&s;t we gave him a &s;mall piece of Iron, with which he immediately leapt over|board and &s;wam to his Con&s;orts; who hovered a|bout our Ship to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue. Then we beckned to them to come aboard again, being very loth to lo&s;e a Commerce with them. Some of the Boats came aboard again, and they were always very Hone&s;t and Civil afterward.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently after this &s;ent a Canoa a&s;hore, to &s;ee their manner of living, and what Provi&s;ion they had: The Canoa's Crew were made very welcome with Ba&s;hee drink, and &s;aw abundance of Hogs, &s;ome of which they bought, and returned aboard. After this the Natives brought aboard both Hogs and Goats to us in their own Boats; and every day we &s;hould have 15 or 20 Hogs and Goats in Boats aboard by our &s;ide. The&s;e we bought for a &s;mall matter; we could buy a good fat Goat for an old Iron Hoop, and a Hog of 70 or 80 pound weight for 2 or 3 pound of Iron. Their drink al&s;o they brought off in Jars, which we bought for old Nails, Spikes, and Leaden Bullets. Be&s;ide the fore-mentioned Commodities, they brought aboard' great quantities of Yams and Potatoes; which we purcha&s;ed for Nails, Spikes, or Bullets, It was one Man's work to be all day cutting out Bars of Iron into &s;mall pieces with a cold Chi&s;el: And the&s;e were for the great Purcha&s;es of Hogs and Goats, which they would not &s;ell for Nails, as their Drink and Roots. Wo never let them know what Store we have, that they may value it the more.
<PB N="436" REF="462">
Every morning, a&s;&s;oon as it was light, they would thus come aboard with their Commodities; which we bought as we had occa&s;ion. We did commonly furni&s;h our &s;elves with as many Goats and Roots as &s;erved us all the day; and their Hogs we bought in large Quantities, as we thought convenient; for we &s;alted them. Their Hogs were very &s;weet; but I never &s;aw &s;o many Meazled ones.</P>
<P>We filled all our Water at a curious Brook clo&s;e by us in <HI>Grafton</HI>'s I&s;le, where we fir&s;t anchored. We &s;tayed there about three or four days, before we went to other I&s;lands. We &s;ailed to the South|ward, pa&s;&s;ing on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Grafton</HI> I&s;land, and then pa&s;&s;ed thro' between that and <HI>Monmouth</HI> I&s;land; but we found no Anchoring till we came to the North end of <HI>Monmouth</HI> I&s;land, and there we &s;topt during one Tide. The Tide runs very &s;trong here, and &s;ometimes makes a &s;hort chop|ping Sea. Its cour&s;e among the&s;e I&s;lands is S. by E. and N. by W. The Flood &s;ets to the North, and Ebb to the South, and it ri&s;eth and falleth 8 Foot.</P>
<P>When we went from hence, we coa&s;ted about 2 Leagues to the Southward, on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Monmouth</HI> I&s;land; and finding no Anchor-ground, we &s;tood over to the <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> I&s;land, and came to an Anchor on the North Ea&s;t part of it, again&s;t a &s;mall &s;andy Bay, in 7 fathom clean hard Sand, and about a quarter of a Mile from the Shore. Here is a pretty wide Channel between the&s;e two I&s;lands, and Anchoring all over it. The Depth of Water is 12, 14, and 16 Fathom.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently built a Tent a&s;hore, to mend our Sails in, and &s;tay'd all the re&s;t of our time here, <HI>viz.</HI> from the 13th day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> till the 26th day of <HI>September.</HI> In which time we mended our Sails, and &s;crubb'd our Ships bottom very well; and eve|ry day &s;ome of us went to their Towns, and were
<PB N="437" REF="463">
kindly entertained by them. Their Boats al&s;o came aboard with their Merchandize to &s;ell, and lay aboard all Day; and if we did not take it off their Hands one day, they would bring the &s;ame again the next.</P>
<P>We had yet the Winds at S. W. and S. S. W. mo&s;tly fair Weather. In <HI>October</HI> we did expect the Winds to &s;hift to the N. E. and therefore we pro|vided to &s;ail (a&s;&s;oon as the Ea&s;tern Mon&s;oon was &s;ettled) to cruize off of <HI>Manila.</HI> Accordingly we provided a &s;tock of Provi&s;ion. We &s;alted 70 or 80 good fat Hogs, and bought Yams and Potatoes good &s;tore to eat at Sea.</P>
<P>About the 24th day of <HI>September,</HI> the Winds &s;hifted about to the Ea&s;t, and from thence to the N. E. fine fair Weather. The 25th it came at N. and began to grow fre&s;h, and the Sky began to be clouded; and the Wind fre&s;hned on us.</P>
<P>At 12 a clock at night it blew a very fierce Storm. We were then riding with our be&s;t Bower a Head and though our Yards and Top-ma&s;t were down, yet we drove. This obliged us to let go our Sheet-Anchor, veering out a good &s;cope of Cable, which &s;topt us till 10 or 11 a clock the next day. Then the Wind came on &s;o fierce, that &s;he drove again, with both Anchors a-head. The Wind was now at N. by W. and we kept driving till 3 or 4 a clock in the afternoon: and it was well for us that there were no I&s;lands, Rocks, or Sands in our way, for if there had, we mu&s;t have been driven upon them. We u&s;ed our utmo&s;t Endea|vours to &s;top here, being loath to go to Sea, be|cau&s;e we had &s;ix of our Men a&s;hore, who could not get off now. At la&s;t we were driven out into deep Water, and then it was in vain to wait any longer: Therefore we hove in our Sheet Cable, and got up our Sheet Anchor, and cut away our be&s;t Bower, (for to have heav'd her up then would
<PB N="438" REF="464">
have gone near to have foundred us) and &s;o put to Sea. We had very violent Weather the night en|&s;uing, with very hard Rain, and we were forced to &s;cud with our bare Poles till 3 a Clock in the morning. Then the Wind &s;lacken'd, and we brought our Ship to, under a mizen, and lay with our Head to the We&s;tward. The 27th day the Wind abated much, but it rained very hard all day, and the Night en&s;uing. The 28th day the Wind came about to the N. E. and it cleared up, and blew a hard Gale, but it &s;tood not there, for it &s;hifted about to the Ea&s;tward, thence to the S. E. then to the South, and at la&s;t &s;ettled at S. W. and then we had a moderate Gale and fair Wea|ther.</P>
<P>It was the 29th day when the Wind came to the S. W. Then we made all the Sail we could for the I&s;land again. The 30th day we had the Wind at We&s;t, and &s;aw the I&s;lands; but could not get in before night. Therefore we &s;tood off to the Southward till two a Clock in the morning; then we tackt, and &s;tood in all the morning, and about 12 a clock, the 1&s;t day of <HI>October,</HI> we an|chored again at the place from whence we were driven.</P>
<P>Then our &s;ix Men were brought aboard by the Natives, to whom we gave 3 whole Bars of Iron, for their kindne&s;s and civility, which was an ex|traordinaay Pre&s;ent to them. Mr. <HI>Robert Hall</HI> was one of the Men that was left a&s;hore. I &s;hall &s;peak more of him hereafter. He and the re&s;t of them told me, that after the Ship was out of &s;ight, the Natives began to be more kind to them than they had been before, and per&s;uaded them to cut their Hair &s;hort, as theirs was, offering to each of them if they would do it, a young Woman to Wife, and a &s;mall Hatchet, and other Iron Uten&s;ils, fit for a Planter, in Dowry; and withal &s;hewed
<PB N="439" REF="465">
them a piece of Land for them to manage They were courted thus by &s;everal of the Town where they then were: but they took up their head quar|ters at the Hou&s;e of him with whom they fir&s;t went a&s;hore. When the Ship appeared in &s;ight again, then they importuned them for &s;ome Iron, which is the chief thing that they covet, even above their Ear-rings. We might have bought all their Ear-rings, or other Gold they had, with our Iron-bars, had we been a&s;&s;ur'd of its goodne&s;s; and yet when it was touch'd and compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d with other Gold, we could not di&s;cern any difference, tho' it look'd &s;o pale in the lump; but the &s;eeing them poli&s;h it &s;o often, was a new di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Storm put our Men quite out of heart: for although it was not altogether &s;o fierce as that which we were in on the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> which was &s;till fre&s;h in Memory, yet it wrought more powerfully, and frighted them from their de&s;ign of crui&s;ing before <HI>Manila,</HI> fearing another Storm there. Now every Man wi&s;ht him&s;elf at home, as they had done an hundred times before: But Captain <HI>Read,</HI> and Captain <HI>Teat</HI> the Ma&s;ter, per&s;uaded them to go towards Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> and then they would tell them more of their Minds, intending doubtle&s;s to cruize in the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and they ea&s;ily prevailed with the Crew.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tern Mon&s;oon was now at hand, and the be&s;t way had been to go through the Streights of <HI>Malacca:</HI> but Captain <HI>Teat</HI> &s;aid it was dangerous, by rea&s;on of many I&s;lands and Shoals there, with which none of us were acquainted. Therefore he thought it be&s;t to go round on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of all the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, and &s;o keeping South toward the <HI>Spice I&s;lands,</HI> to pa&s;s out into the <HI>Ea&s;t Indian</HI> Ocean about the I&s;land <HI>Timor.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="466">
This &s;eemed to be a very tedious way about, and as dangerous altogether for Sholes; but not for meeting with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, which was their greate&s;t Fear.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE third Day of <HI>October</HI> 1687. we &s;ailed from the&s;e I&s;lands, &s;tanding to the Southward; intending to &s;ail through among the Spice I&s;lands. We had fair Weather, and the Wind at We&s;t. We fir&s;t &s;teer'd S. S. W. and pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by certain &s;mall I&s;lands that lye ju&s;t by the North-end of the I&s;land <HI>Luconia.</HI> We left them all on the We&s;t of us, and pa&s;t on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Phi|lippine</HI> I&s;lands, coa&s;ting to the Southward.</P>
<P>The N. Ea&s;t-end of the I&s;land <HI>Luconia</HI> appears to be good Champion Land, of an indifferent heighth, plain and even for many Leagues; only it has &s;ome pretty high Hills &s;tanding upright by them&s;elves in the&s;e Plains; but no ridges of Hills, or chains of Mountains joyning one to another. The Land on this &s;ide &s;eems to be mo&s;t Savannah, or Pa&s;ture: The S. E part is more Mountainous and Woody.</P>
<P>Leaving the I&s;land <HI>Luconia,</HI> and with it our Gol|den Projects, we &s;ailed on to the Southward, pa&s;&s;ing on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the re&s;t of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands. The&s;e appear to be more Mountainous, and le&s;s Woody, till we came in &s;ight of the I&s;land St. <HI>John;</HI> the fir&s;t of that name I mentioned: the other I
<PB N="443" REF="469">
&s;pake of on the Coa&s;t of <HI>China.</HI> This I have alrea|dy de&s;cribed to be a very woody I&s;land. Here the Wind coming Southerly, forced us to keep farther from the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The 14 day of <HI>October</HI> we came clo&s;e by a &s;mall low woody I&s;land, that lieth Ea&s;t from the S. E. end of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> di&s;tant from it about 20 Leagues. I do not find it &s;et down in any Sea-Chart.</P>
<P>The 15th day we had the Wind at N. E. and we &s;teered We&s;t for the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and arri|ved at the S. E. end again on the 16th day. There we went in and anchored between two &s;mall I&s;lands, which lie in about 5 d. 10 m. North Lat. I mentioned them when we fir&s;t came on this Coa&s;t. Here we found a fine &s;mall Cove, on the N. W. end of the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land, fit to careen in, or hale a&s;hore; &s;o we went in there, and pre|&s;ently unrigg'd our Ship, and provided to hale our Ship a&s;hore, to clean her bottom. The&s;e I&s;lands are about 3 or 4 Leagues from the I&s;land <HI>Mindanao;</HI> they are about 4 or 5 Leagues in Circumference, and of a pretty good heighth. The Mold is black and deep; and there are two &s;mall Brooks of fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>They are both plentifully &s;tored with great high Trees; therefore our Carpenters were &s;ent a&s;hore to cut down &s;ome of them for our u&s;e; for here they made a new Bolt&s;prit, which we did &s;et here al&s;o, our old one being very &s;aulty. They made a new Fore-yard too, and a Fore-top-ma&s;t: And our Pumps being faulty, and not &s;erviceable, they did cut a Tree to make a Pump. They fir&s;t &s;qua|red it, then &s;awed it in the middle, and then hol|lowed each &s;ide exactly. The two hollow &s;ides were made big enough to contain a Pump-box in the mid&s;t of them both, when they were joined to|gether; and it required their utmo&s;t Skill to clo&s;e them exactly to the making a tight Cylinder for the
<PB N="444" REF="470">
Pump-box; being unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch Work. We learnt this way of Pump-making from the <HI>Spa|niards;</HI> who make their Pumps that they u&s;e in their Ships in the <HI>South-Seas</HI> after this manner; and I am confident that there are no better Hand-pumps in the World than they have.</P>
<P>While we lay here, the young Prince that I men|tioned in the 13th Chapter, came aboard. He under|&s;tanding that we were bound farther to the South|ward, de&s;ired us to tran&s;port him and his Men to his own I&s;land. He &s;hewed it to us in our Draft, and told us the Name of it; which we put down in our Draft, for it was not named there; but I quite forgot to put it into my Journal.</P>
<P>This Man told us, that not above &s;ix days before this, he &s;aw Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> and &s;everal of his Men that we left there, and named the Names of &s;ome of them, who, he &s;aid, were all well, and that now they were at the City of <HI>Mindanao;</HI> but that they had all of them been out with <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> fighting under him in his Wars again&s;t his Enemies the <HI>Al|foores;</HI> and that mo&s;t of them fought with un|daunted Courage; for which they were highly ho|noured and e&s;teemed, as well by the Sultan, as by the General <HI>Raja Laut;</HI> that now Capt. <HI>Swan</HI> intend|ed to go with his Men to Fort <HI>St. George,</HI> and that in order thereto, he had proffered forty Ounces of Gold for a Ship; but the Owner and he were not yet agreed; and that he feared that the Sultan would not let him go away till the Wars were ended.</P>
<P>All this the Prince told us in the <HI>Malayan</HI> Tongue, which many of us had learnt; and when he went away he promi&s;ed to return to us again in 3 days time, and &s;o long Captain <HI>Read</HI> promi&s;ed to &s;tay for him (for we had now almo&s;t fini&s;hed our Bu&s;i|ne&s;s) and he &s;eemed very glad of the opportunity of going with us.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="471">
After this I endeavoured to per&s;wade our Men, to return with the Ship to the River of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and offer their Service again to Captain <HI>Swan.</HI> I took an opportunity when they were filling of Water, there being then half the Ships Company a&s;hore; and I found all the&s;e very willing to do it. I de&s;ired them to &s;ay nothing, till I had tried the Minds of the other half, which I intended to do the next day; it being their turn to fill Water then; But one of the&s;e Men, who &s;eemed mo&s;t forward to invite back Captain <HI>Swan,</HI> told Captain <HI>Read</HI> and Captain <HI>Teat</HI> of the Project, and they pre&s;ently di&s;&s;waded the Men from any &s;uch De&s;igns. Yet fearing the wor&s;t, they made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to be gone.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince been informed, that Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Men &s;tayed there a great while afterward; and that many of the Men got pa&s;&s;age from thence in <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloops to <HI>Ternate,</HI> particularly Mr. <HI>Rofy,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nelly.</HI> There they remained a great while, and at la&s;t got to <HI>Batavia</HI> (where the <HI>Dutch</HI> took their Journals from them) and &s;o to <HI>Europe;</HI> and that &s;ome of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Men died at <HI>Mindanao;</HI> of which number Mr. <HI>Harthrope,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Cap|tain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Merchants were two. At la&s;t Captain <HI>Swan</HI> and his Surgeon going in a &s;mall Canoa a|board of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship then in the Road, in order to get pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Europe,</HI> were over&s;et by the Na|tives at the Mouth of the River; who waited their coming purpo&s;ely to do it, but un&s;u&s;pected by them; where they both were kill'd in the Water. This was done by the General's Order, as &s;ome think, to get his Gold, which he did immediately &s;eize on. Others &s;ay, it was becau&s;e the General's Hou&s;e was burnt a little before, and Captain <HI>Swan</HI> was &s;u&s;pected to be the Author of it; and others &s;ay, That it was Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s Threats occa&s;ioned his own Ruin; for he would often &s;ay pa&s;&s;ionate|ly,
<PB N="446" REF="472">
that he had been abu&s;ed by the General, and that he would have &s;atisfaction for it; &s;aying al&s;o, that now he was well acquainted with their Rivers, and knew how to come in at any time; that he al&s;o knew their manner of Fighting, and the Weakne&s;s of their Country; and therefore he would go a|way, and get a Band of Men to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and re|turning thither again, he would &s;poil and take all that they had, and their Country too. When the General had been informed of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, he would &s;ay, What, is Captain <HI>Swan</HI> made of Iron, and able to re&s;i&s;t a whole Kingdom? Or does he think that we are afraid of him, that he &s;peaks thus? Yet did he never touch him, till now the <HI>Mindanayans</HI> kill'd him. It is very probable there might be &s;omewhat of Truth in all this; for the Captain was pa&s;&s;ionate, and the General greedy of Gold. But whatever was the occa&s;ion, &s;o he was killed, as &s;everal have a&s;&s;ured me, and his Gold &s;eized on, and all his Things; and his Journal al&s;o from <HI>England,</HI> as far as Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico.</HI> This Journal was afterwards &s;ent away from thence by Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> (who was there both a little before and a little after the Murder) and he &s;ent it to <HI>England</HI> by Mr. <HI>Goddard,</HI> Chief Mate of the <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>But to our purpo&s;e: Seeing I could not per&s;uade them to go to Captain <HI>Swan</HI> again, I had a great de&s;ire to have had the Prince's Company: But Captain <HI>Read</HI> was afraid to let his fickle Crew lie long. That very day that the Prince had promi&s;ed to return to us, which was <HI>November</HI> 2. 1687. we &s;ailed hence, directing our cour&s;e South-We&s;t, and having the Wind at N. W.</P>
<P>This Wind continued till we came in &s;ight of the I&s;land <HI>Celebes;</HI> then it veered about to the W. and to the Southward of the We&s;t. We came up with the N. E. end of the I&s;land <HI>Celebes</HI> the 9th
<PB N="447" REF="473">
day, and there we found the Current &s;etting to the We&s;tward &s;o &s;trongly, that we could hardly get on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of that I&s;land.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Celebes</HI> is a very large I&s;land, extend|ed in length from North to South, about 7 de|grees of Lat. and in breadth it is about 3 degrees. It lies under the Equator, the North-end being in Lat. 1 d. 30 m. North, and the South-end in Lat. 5 d. 30 m. South, and by common account the North-point in the Bulk of this I&s;land, lies neare&s;t North and South, but at the North-Ea&s;t end there runs out a long narrow Point, &s;tretching N. E. a|bout 30 Leagues; and about 30 Leagues to the Ea&s;t|ward of this long Slipe, is the I&s;land <HI>Gilolo,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide of which are 4 &s;mall I&s;lands, clo&s;e by it, which are very well &s;tored with Cloves. The two chiefe&s;t are <HI>Ternate</HI> and <HI>Tidore;</HI> and as the I&s;le of <HI>Ceylon</HI> is reckoned the only place for Cinna|mon, and that of <HI>Banda</HI> for Nutmegs, &s;o the&s;e are thought by &s;ome to be the only Clove-I&s;lands in the World; but this is a great Error, as I have already &s;hewn.</P>
<P>At the South-end of the I&s;land <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lebes</HI> there is a Sea or Gulph, of about 7 or 8 Leagues wide, and 40 or 50 long, which runs up the Country al|mo&s;t directly to the North; and this Gulph hath &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands along the middle of it. On the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, almo&s;t at the South-end of it, the Town of <HI>Maca&s;&s;er</HI> is &s;eated. A Town of great Strength and Trade, belonging to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>There are great Inlets and Lakes on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land; as al&s;o abundance of &s;mall I&s;lands, and Sholes lying &s;cattered about it. We &s;aw a high peeked Hill at the N. end: but the Land on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide is low all along; for we cruized al|mo&s;t the length of it. The Mold on this &s;ide is black and deep, and extraordinary fat and rich,
<PB N="448" REF="474">
and full of Trees: And there are many Brooks of Water run out into the Sea. Indeed all this Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land &s;eems to be but one large Grove of extraordinary great high Trees.</P>
<P>Having with much ado got on this Ea&s;t-&s;ide, coa&s;t|ing along to the Southward, and yet having but lit|tle Wind, and even that little again&s;t us, at S. S. W. and &s;ometimes Calm, we were a long time going a|bout the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The 22d day we were in Lat. 1 d. 20 m. South, and being about 3 Leagues from the I&s;land &s;tanding to the Southward, with a very gentle Land-Wind, about 2 or 3 a Clock in the Morning, we heard a cla&s;hing in the Water, like Boats rowing: and fear|ing &s;ome &s;udden Attack, we got up all our Arms, and &s;tood ready to defend our &s;elves. As &s;oon as it was day, we &s;aw a great Proe, built like the <HI>Minda|nayan</HI> Proes, with about 60 Men in her: and 6 &s;mal|ler Proes. They lay &s;till about a Mile to windward of us, to view us; and probably de&s;ign'd to make a Prey of us when they fir&s;t came out; but they were now afraid to venture on us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we &s;hewed them <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours, thinking thereby to allure them to come to us: for we could not go to them; but they pre&s;ently rowed in to|ward the I&s;land, and went into a large Opening; and we &s;aw them no more; nor did we ever &s;ee a|ny other Boats or Men, but only one fi&s;hing Canoa, while we were about this I&s;land; neither did we &s;ee any Hou&s;e on all the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>About 5 or 6 Leagues to the South of this place, there is a great Range of both large and &s;mall I&s;lands; and many Shoals al&s;o that are not laid down in our Drafts; which made it extreamly trouble&s;ome for us to get through. But we pa&s;t between them all and the I&s;land <HI>Celebes,</HI> and anchored again&s;t a &s;andy Bay in 8 Fathom &s;andy Ground, about half a Mile from the main I&s;land; being then in Lat. 1 d. 50 m. South.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="475">
Here we &s;tay'd &s;everal Days, and &s;ent out our Canoas a &s;triking of Turtle every Day; for here is great plenty of them; but they were very &s;hy, as they were generally where-ever we found them in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Seas. I know not the rea&s;on of it, un|le&s;s the Natives go very much a &s;triking here: for even in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> they are &s;hy in places that are much di&s;turbed: And yet on <HI>New-Holland</HI> we found them &s;hy, as I &s;hall relate; tho' the Natives there do not mole&s;t them.</P>
<P>On the Sholes without us we went and gathered Shell-fi&s;h at low Water. There were a mon&s;trous &s;ort of Cockles; the Meat of one of them would &s;uffice 7 or 8 Men. It was very good whol&s;om Meat. We did al&s;o beat about in the Woods on the I&s;land, but found no Game. One of our Men who was always troubled with &s;ore Legs, found a certain Vine that &s;upported it &s;elf by clinging about other Trees. The Leaves reach 6 or 7 Foot high, but the Strings or Branches 11 or 12. It had a very green Leaf, pretty broad and roundi&s;h, and of a thick Sub&s;tance. The&s;e Leaves pounded &s;mall and boiled with Hogs Lard, make an excellent Salve. Our Men, knowing the Vertues of it, &s;tockt them&s;elves here: there was &s;carce a Man in the Ship but got a Pound or two of it; e&s;pecially &s;uch as were troubled with old Ulcers, who found great benefit by it. This Man that di&s;covered the&s;e leaves here had his fir&s;t knowledge of them in the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> he having had his Receipt from one of the <HI>Indians</HI> there: and he had been a&s;hore in divers places &s;ince, purpo&s;ely to &s;eek the&s;e Leaves, but did never find any but here. Among the many va&s;t Trees hereabouts, there was one exceeded all the re&s;t. This Captain <HI>Read</HI> cau&s;ed to be cut down, in order to make a Canoa, having lo&s;t our Boats, all but one &s;mall one, in the late Storms; &s;o 6 lu&s;ty Men, who had been Logwood-cutters in
<PB N="450" REF="476">
the Bays of <HI>Campeachy</HI> and <HI>Honduras</HI> (as Captain <HI>Read</HI> him&s;elf, and many more of us had) and &s;o were very expert at this work, undertook to fell it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> taking their turn, 3 always cutting together; and they were one whole Day, and half the next be|fore they got it down. This Tree, though it grew in a Wood, was yet 18 Foot in circumference, and 44 Foot of clean Body, without Knot or Branch: and even there it had no more than one or two Branches, and then ran clean again 10 Foot higher; there it &s;pread it &s;elf into many great Limbs and Branches, like an Oak, very green and flouri&s;hing: yet it was peri&s;ht at the Heart, which marr'd it for the Service intended.</P>
<P>So leaving it, and having no more Bu&s;ine&s;s here, we weighed, and went from hence the next Day, it being the 29th Day of <HI>November.</HI> While we lay here we had &s;ome Tornadoes, one or two every Day, and pretty fre&s;h Land-winds which were at We&s;t. The Sea-breezes were &s;mall and uncertain, &s;ometimes out of the N. E. and &s;o veering about to the Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t. We had the Wind at North Ea&s;t when we weighed, and we &s;teered off S. S. W. In the Afternoon we &s;aw a Shole a-head of us, and altered our Cour&s;e to the S. S. E. In the Evening, at 4 a Clock, we were clo&s;e by another great Shole; therefore we tackt, and &s;tood in for the I&s;land <HI>Celebes</HI> again, for fear of running on &s;ome of the Sholes in the Night. By Day a Man might avoid them well enough, for they had all Beacons on them, like Huts built on tall Po&s;ts, above High-water Mark, probably &s;et up by the Natives of the I&s;land <HI>Celebes,</HI> or tho&s;e of &s;ome other neighbouring I&s;lands; and I never &s;aw any &s;uch el&s;ewhere. In the Night we had a violent Tornado out of the S. W. which la&s;ted about an Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="477">
The 30th day we had a fre&s;h Land Wind, and &s;teered away South, pa&s;&s;ing between the 2 Shoals, which we &s;aw the Day before. The&s;e Shoals lye in Lat. 3 d. South, and about 10 Leagues from the I&s;land <HI>Celebes.</HI> Being pa&s;t them, the Wind died away; and we lay becalmed till the Afternoon: Then we had a hard Tornado out of the South We&s;t, and towards the Evening, we &s;aw two or three Spouts, the fir&s;t I had &s;een &s;ince I came into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> I had often met with them. A Spout is a &s;mall Ragged piece or part of a Cloud hanging down about a Yard; &s;eemingly from the blacke&s;t part thereof. Com|monly it hangs down &s;loping from thence; or &s;ometimes appearing with a &s;mall bending, or elbow in the middle. I never &s;aw any hang per|pendicularly down. It is &s;mall at the lower end, &s;eeming no bigger than ones Arm, but 'tis fuller towards the Cloud, from whence it proceeds.</P>
<P>When the &s;urface of the Sea begins to work; you &s;hall &s;ee the Water, for about 100 paces in circumference, foam and move gently round till the whirling motion increa&s;es: and then it flies upward in a Pillar, about 100 Paces in compa&s;s at the bottom, but le&s;&s;ening gradually upwards to the &s;mallne&s;s of the Spout it &s;elf, there where it reacheth the lower end of the Spout, through which the ri&s;ing Sea-water &s;eems to be conveyed into the Clouds. This vi&s;ibly appears by the Clouds increa&s;ing in bulk and blackne&s;s. Then you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee the Cloud drive along, al|though before it &s;eemed to be without any mo|tion: the Spout al&s;o keeping the &s;ame cour&s;e with the Cloud, and &s;till &s;ucking up the Water as it goes along, and they make a Wind as they go. Thus it continues for the &s;pace of half an Hour, more or le&s;s, until the &s;ucking is &s;pent, and then breaking off, all the Water which was below
<PB N="452" REF="478">
the Spout, or pendulous piece of Cloud, falls down again into the Sea, making a great noi&s;e with its fall and cla&s;hing motion in the Sea.</P>
<P>It is very dangerous for a Ship to be under a Spout when it breaks, therefore we always en|deavoured to &s;hun it, by keeping at a di&s;tance, if po&s;&s;ibly we can. But for want of Wind to carry us away, we are often in great fear and danger; for it is u&s;ually calm when Spouts are at work, except only ju&s;t where they are. Therefore Men at Sea, when they &s;ee a Spout coming, and know not how to avoid it, do &s;ometimes fire Shot out of their great Guns into it, to give it air or vent, that &s;o it may break; but I did never hear that it proved to be of any benefit.</P>
<P>And now being on this Subject, I think it not ami&s;s to give you an account of an accident that happened to a Ship once on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> &s;ome time in or about the Year 1674. One Cap|tain <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> bound for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> in a Ship of 300 Tuns, and 16 Guns, called the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> when he came into the Lat. 7 or 8 degrees North, he &s;aw &s;everal Spouts, one of which came directly towards the Ship, and he having no Wind to get out of the way of the Spout, made ready to receive it by furling his Sails. It came on very &s;wift, and broke a little before it reached the Ship; making a great noi&s;e, and rai&s;ing the Sea round it, as if a great Hou&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch thing, had been ca&s;t into the Sea. The fury of the Wind &s;till la&s;ted, and took the Ship on the Starboard|bow with &s;uch violence, that it &s;napt off the Bolt&s;prit and Fore-ma&s;t both at once, and blew the Ship all along, ready to over-&s;et it, but the Ship did pre&s;ently right again, and the Wind whirling round, took the Ship a &s;econd time with the like fury as before, but on the contrary &s;ide, and was again like to over-&s;et her the other way.
<PB N="453" REF="479">
The Mizen-ma&s;t felt the fury of this &s;econd Bla&s;t, and was &s;napt &s;hort off, as the Fore-ma&s;t and Bolt|&s;prit had been before. The Main-ma&s;t, and Main|top-ma&s;t received no damage, for the fury of the Wind, (which was pre&s;ently over) did not reach them. Three Men were in the Fore-top when the Fore-ma&s;t broke, and one on the Bolt&s;prit, and fell with them into the Sea, but all of them were &s;aved. I had this Relation from Mr. <HI>John. Canby,</HI> who was then Quarter-ma&s;ter and Steward of her; one <HI>Abraham Wi&s;e</HI> was Chief Mate, and <HI>Leonard Jefferies</HI> Second Mate.</P>
<P>We are u&s;ually very much afraid of them: Yet this was the only damage that ever I heard done by them. They &s;eem terrible enough; the rather becau&s;e they come upon you while you lie becalm'd, like a Log in the Sea, and cannot get out of their way: But though I have &s;een, and been be&s;et by them often, yet the Fright was always the greate&s;t of the harm.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 1&s;t, we had a gentle Gale at E. S. E. we &s;teered South; and at noon I was by Ob&s;erva|tion in Lat. 3 d. 34 m. South. Then we &s;aw the I&s;land <HI>Bouton,</HI> bearing South We&s;t, and about 10 Leagues di&s;tant. We had very uncertain and un|con&s;tant Winds: The Tornadoes came out of the S. W. which was again&s;t us; and what other Winds we had were &s;o faint, that they did us little kindne&s;s; but we took the advantage of the &s;malle&s;t Gale, and got a little way every day. The 4th day at noon I was by Ob&s;ervation in Lat. 4 d. 30 m. South.</P>
<P>The 5th day we got clo&s;e by the N. W. end of the I&s;land <HI>Bouton,</HI> and in the Evening, it being fair Weather, we hoi&s;ed out our Canoa, and &s;ent the Moskito Men, of whom we had 2 or 3; to &s;trike Turtle, for here are plenty of them; but they being &s;hy, we cho&s;e to &s;trike them in the night (which
<PB N="454" REF="480">
is cu&s;tomary in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o) for every time they come up to breathe, which is once in 8 or 10 minutes, they blow &s;o hard, that one may hear them at 30 or 40 yards di&s;tance; by which means the Striker knows where they are, and may more ea&s;ily approach them than in the day; for the Tur|tle &s;ees better than he hears; but, on the contrary, the Manatee's hearing is quicke&s;t.</P>
<P>In the morning they returned with a very large Turtle, which they took near the Shore; and withal an <HI>Indian</HI> of the I&s;land cameaboard with them. He &s;pake the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language; by which we did under&s;tand him. He told us, that 2 Leagues far|ther to the Southward of us, there was a good Harbour, in which we might Anchor: So having a fair Wind, we got thither by noon.</P>
<P>This Harbour is in Lat. 4 d. 54 m. South; lying on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Bouton.</HI> Which I&s;land lies near the S. E. end of the I&s;land <HI>Celebcs,</HI> di&s;tant from it about 3 or 4 leagues. It is of a long form, &s;tretching S. W. and N. E. about 25 Leagues long, and 10 broad. It is pretty high Land, and appears pretty even, and flat, and very woody.</P>
<P>There is a large Town within a League of the anchoring place, called <HI>Calla&s;u&s;ung,</HI> being the chief, if there were more; which we knew not. It is about a Mile from the Sea, on the top of a &s;mall Hill, in a very fair Plain, incompa&s;&s;ed with Coco|nut Trees. Without the Trees there is a &s;trong Stone Wall, clear round the Town. The Hou&s;es are built like the Hou&s;es at <HI>Mindanao;</HI> but more neat: And the whole Town was very clean and delight&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are &s;mall, and well &s;haped. They are much like the <HI>Mindanaians</HI> in &s;hape, co|lour, and habit; but more neat and tight. They &s;peak the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language, and are all <HI>Mahome|tans.</HI> They are very obedient to the Sultan, who
<PB N="455" REF="481">
is a little Man, about 40 or 50 years old, and hath a great many Wives and Children.</P>
<P>About an hour after we came to an Anchor, the Sultan &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger aboard, to know what we were, and what our Bu&s;ine&s;s. We gave him an ac|count, and he returned a&s;hore, and in a &s;hort time after he came aboard again, and told us, That the Sultan was very well plea&s;ed when he heard that we were <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and &s;aid, That we &s;hould have any thing that the I&s;land afforded; and that he him&s;elf would come aboard in the morning. Therefore the Ship was made clean, and every thing put in the be&s;t order to receive him.</P>
<P>The 6th day in the morning betimes a great many Boats and Canoas came aboard, with Fowls, Eggs, Plantains, Potatoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they would di&s;po&s;e of none till they had order for it from the Sultan, at his coming. About 10 a clock the Sul|tan came aboard in a very neat Proe, built after the <HI>Mindanao</HI> Fa&s;hion. There was a large white Silk Flag at the head of the Ma&s;t, edged round with a deep red for about 2 or 3 Inches broad, and in the middle there was neatly drawn a Green Griffon, trampling on a winged Serpent, that &s;eemed to &s;truggle to get up, and threatned his Adver&s;ary with open Mouth, and with a long Sting that was ready to be darted into his Legs. Other <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Princes have their Devices al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Sultan with 3 or 4 of his Nobles, and 3 of his Sons, &s;ate in the Hou&s;e of the Proe. His Guards were 10 Mu&s;queteers, 5 &s;tanding on one &s;ide of the Proe, and 5 on the other &s;ide, and be|fore the door of the Proe-hou&s;e &s;tood one with a great broad Sword and a Target, and 2 more &s;uch at the after part of the Hou&s;e; and in the Head and Stern of the Proe &s;tood 4 Mu&s;queteers more, 2 at each end.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="482">
The Sultan had a Silk Turbat, laced with nar|row Gold Lace by the &s;ides, and broad Lace at the end: which hung down on one &s;ide the Head, after the <HI>Mindanayan</HI> Fa&s;hion. He had a Sky coloured Silk pair of Breeches, and a piece of red Silk thrown cro&s;s his Shouldiers, and hanging loofe about him; the greate&s;t part of his Back and Wai&s;t appearing naked. He had neither Stocking nor Shoe. One of his Sons was about 15 or 16 year old, the other two were young things; and they were always in the arms of one or other of his Attendants.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Read</HI> met him at the &s;ide, and led him into his &s;mall Cabin, and fired five Guns for his welcome. A&s;&s;oon as he came aboard he gave leave to his Subjects to traffick with us; and then our People bought what they had a mind to. The Sultan &s;eemed very well pleas'd to be vi&s;ited by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and &s;aid he had coveted to have a &s;ight of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> having heard extraordinary Characters of their ju&s;t and honourable Dealing: But he ex|claimed again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> (as all the <HI>Mindanayans,</HI> and all the <HI>Indians</HI> we met with do) and wi&s;h'd them at a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>For <HI>Maca&s;&s;er</HI> is not very far from henee, one of the chiefe&s;t Towns that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have in tho&s;e parts. From thence the <HI>Dutch</HI> comes &s;ometimes hi|ther to purcha&s;e Slaves. The Slaves that the&s;e Peo|ple get here and &s;ell to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are &s;ome of the idolatrous Natives of the I&s;land, who not being under the Sultan, and having no Head, live &s;trag|gling in the Country, flying from one place to another to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the Prince and his Subjects, who hunt after them to make them Slaves. For the Civilized <HI>Indians</HI> of the Maritime Places, who Trade with Foreigners, if they can|not reduce the inland People to the Obedience of their Prince, they catch all they can of them and &s;ell them for Slaves; accounting them to be but
<PB N="457" REF="483">
as Savages, ju&s;t as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do the poor <HI>Ame|ricans.</HI></P>
<P>After two or three Hours di&s;cour&s;e, the Sultan went a&s;hore again, and 5 Guns were fired at his departure al&s;o. The next day he &s;ent for Captain <HI>Read</HI> to come a&s;hore, and he with 7 or 8 Men, went to wait on the Sultan. I could not &s;lip an opportunity of &s;eeing the Place; and &s;o accom|panied them. We were met at the landing place by two of the chief Men, and guided to a pretty neat Hou&s;e, where the Sultan waited our coming. The Hou&s;e &s;tood at the farther end of all the Town before-mentioned, which we pa&s;t through; and abundance of People were gazing on us as we pa&s;t by. When we came near the Hou&s;e, there were 40 poor naked Soldiers with Mu&s;quets made a Lane for us to pa&s;s through. This Hou&s;e was not built on Po&s;ts, as the re&s;t were, after the <HI>Mindanayan</HI> way; but the Room in which we were enter|tained was on the Ground, covered with Mats to &s;it on. Our Entertainment was Tobacco and Betel|nut, and young Coco-nuts; and the Hou&s;e was be&s;et with Men, and Women and Children, who thronged to get near the Windows to look on us.</P>
<P>We did not tarry above an hour before we took our leaves and departed. This Town &s;tands in a &s;andy Soil; but what the re&s;t of the I&s;land is I know not, for none of us were a&s;hore but at this Place.</P>
<P>The next day the Sultan came aboard again, and pre&s;ented Capt. <HI>Read</HI> with a little Boy, but he was too &s;mall to be &s;erviceable on board; and &s;o Captain <HI>Read</HI> returned Thanks, and told him he was to little for him. Then the Sultan &s;ent for a bigger Boy, which the Captain accepted. This Boy was a very pretty tractable Boy; but what was wonderful in him, he had two Rows of Teeth,
<PB N="458" REF="484">
one within another on each Jaw. None of the other People were &s;o, nor did I ever &s;ee the like. The Captain was pre&s;ented al&s;o with 2 He-goats, and was promi&s;ed &s;ome Buffaloe, but I do believe that they have but few of either on the I&s;land. We did not &s;ee any Buffaloe, nor many Goats, neither have they much Rice, but their chiefe&s;t Food is Roots. We bought here about a thou&s;and pound Weight of Potatoes. Here our Men bought al&s;o abundance of Crockadores, and fine large Parakites, curiou&s;ly coloured, and &s;ome of them the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The Crockadore is as big as a Parrrot, and &s;haped much like it, with &s;uch a Bill; but it is as white as Milk, and hath a bunch of Feathers on his head like a Crown. At this place we bought a Proe al&s;o of the <HI>Minda|naian</HI> make, for our own u&s;e, which our Carpenters afterwards altered, and made a delicate Boat fit for any Service. She was &s;harp at both ends, but we &s;aw'd off one, and made that end flat, fa&s;t ening a Rudder to it, and &s;he rowed and &s;ailed incomparably.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here but till the 12th day, becau&s;e it was a bad Harbour and foul Ground, and a bad time of the year too, for the Tornadoes began to come in thick, and &s;trong. When we went to weigh our Anchor, it was hooked in a Rock, and we broke our Cable, and could not get our Anchor, though we &s;trove hard for it; &s;o we went away and left it there. We had the Wind at N. N. E. and we &s;teered towards the S. E. and fell in with 4 or 5 &s;mall I&s;lands, that lie in 5d. 40 m. South Lat. and about 5 or 6 Leagues from <HI>Calla&s;u&s;ung</HI> Harbour. The&s;e I&s;lands appeared very green with Coco-nut Trees, and we &s;aw two or three Towns on them, and heard a Drum all night; for we were got in among Shoals, end could no get out again till the next day. We knew not whether the Drum were for for fear of us,
<PB N="459" REF="485">
or that they were making merry, as 'tis u&s;ual in the&s;e parts to do all the Night, &s;inging and dancing till Morning.</P>
<P>We found a pretty &s;trong Tide here, the Flood &s;etting to the Southward, and the Ebb to the North|ward. The&s;e Sholes, and many other that are not laid down in our Drafts, lie on the South We&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;lands where we heard the Drum, about a League from them. At la&s;t we pa&s;t between the I&s;lands, and tried for a Pa&s;&s;age on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. We met with divers Sholes on this &s;ide al&s;o, but found Channels to pa&s;s through; &s;o we &s;teer'd away for the I&s;land <HI>Timor,</HI> intending to pa&s;s out by it. We had the Winds commonly at W. S. W. and S. W. hard Gales, and rainy Weather.</P>
<P>The 16th day we got clear of the Shoals, and &s;teered S. by E. with the Wind at W. S. W. but veering every half hour, &s;ometimes at S. W. and then again at W. and &s;ometimes at N. N. W. bring|ing much Rain, with Thunder and Lightning.</P>
<P>The 20th day we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land <HI>Omba,</HI> which is a pretty high I&s;land, lying in Lat. 8 d. 20 m. and not above 5 or 6 Leagues from the N. E. part of the I&s;land <HI>Timor.</HI> It is about 13 or 14 Leagues long, and 5 or 6 Leagues wide.</P>
<P>About 7 or 8 Leagues to the We&s;t of <HI>Omba,</HI> is a|nother pretty large I&s;land, but it had no Name in our Plats; yet by the Situation it &s;hould be that, which in &s;ome Maps is called <HI>Pentare.</HI> We &s;aw on it abun|dance of Smoaks by day, and Fires by night, and a large Town on the North-&s;ide of it, not far from the Sea; but it was &s;uch bad Weather that we did not go a&s;hore. Between <HI>Omba</HI> and <HI>Pentare,</HI> and in the mid Channel, there is a &s;mall low &s;andy I&s;land, with great Sholes on either &s;ide; but there is a very good Channel clo&s;e by <HI>Pentare,</HI> between that and the Sholes about the &s;mall I&s;le. We were three Days beating off and on, not
<PB N="460" REF="486">
having a Wind, for it was at South South We&s;t.</P>
<P>The 23d day in the Evening, having a &s;mall Gale at North, we got through, keeping clo&s;e by <HI>Pen|tare.</HI> The Tide of Ebb here &s;et out to the South|ward, by which we were helped through, for we had but little Wind. But this Tide, which did us a kindne&s;s in &s;etting us through, had like to have ruined us afterwards; for there are two &s;mall I&s;lands lying at the South-end of the Channel we came through, and towards the&s;e I&s;lands the Tide hurried us &s;o &s;wiftly, that we very narrowly e&s;ca|ped being driven a&s;hore; for the little Wind we had before at North dying away, we had not one breath of Wind when we came there, neither was there any Anchor-Ground. But we got out our Oars and rowed, yet all in vain; for the Tide &s;et wholly on one of the &s;mall I&s;lands, that we were forced with might and main Strength to bear off the Ship, by thru&s;ting with our Oars again&s;t the Shore, which was a &s;teep Bank, and by this means we pre&s;ently drove away clear of Danger; and having a little Wind in the Night at North, we &s;teered a|way S. S. W. In the Morning again we had the Wind at W. S. W. and &s;teered S. and the Wind com|ing to the W. N. W. we &s;teered S. W. to get clear of the S. W. end of the I&s;land <HI>Timor.</HI> The 29th day we &s;aw the N. W. point of <HI>Timor</HI> S. E. by E. di&s;tant about 8 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Timor</HI> is a long high mountainous I&s;land &s;tretch|ing N. E. and S. W. It is about 70 Leagues long, and 15 or 16 wide, the middle of the I&s;land is in Lat. about 9 d. South. I have been informed that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> do trade to this I&s;land; but I know no|thing of its produce be&s;ides Coire for making Cables; of which there is mention Chap. X.</P>
<P>The 27th day we &s;aw two &s;mall I&s;lands which lie near the S. W. end of <HI>Timor.</HI> They bear from us S. E. We had very hard Gales of Wind, and
<PB N="461" REF="487">
&s;till with a great deal of Rain; the Wind at W. and W. S. W.</P>
<P>Being now clear of all the I&s;lands, we &s;tood off South, intending to touch at <HI>New Holland,</HI> a part of <HI>Terra Au&s;tralis Incognita,</HI> to &s;ee what that Country would afford us. Indeed, as the Winds were, we could not now keep our intended Cour&s;e (which was fir&s;t we&s;terly, and then northerly) without go|ing to <HI>New Holland,</HI> unle&s;s we had gone back again among the I&s;lands: But this was not a good time of the Year to be among any I&s;lands to the South of the Equator, unle&s;s in a good Harbour.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t day we were in Lat. 13 d. 20 m. &s;till &s;tanding to the Southward, the Wind bearing com|monly very hard at W. we keeping upon it under two Cour&s;es, and our Mizen, and &s;ometimes a Main|top-&s;ail Rift. About 10 a Clock at Night we tackt and &s;tood to the Northward, for fear of running on a Shoal, which is laid down in our Drafts in Lat. 13 d. 50 m. or thereabouts: It bearing S. by W. from the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Timor;</HI> and &s;o the I&s;land bore from us by our Judgments and Reckoning. At 3 a Clock we tackt again, and &s;tood S. by W. and S. S. W.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="year"> In the Morning, a&s;&s;oon as it was day, we &s;aw the Shoal right a-head: It lies in 13 d. 50 m. by all our Reckonings. It is a &s;mall Spit of Sand, ju&s;t ap|pearing above the Waters edge, with &s;everal Rocks about it, 8 or 10 foot high above water. It lies in a triangular Form; each &s;ide being about a League and half. We &s;temm'd right with the middle of it, and &s;tood within half a Mile of the Rocks, and &s;ounded; but found no Ground. Then we went about and &s;tood to the North two Hours; and then tackt and &s;tood to the Southward again, thinking to weather it, but could not. So we bore away on the North-&s;ide, till we came to the Ea&s;t-point, giving the Rocks a &s;mall birth: Then we trimm'd
<PB N="462" REF="488">
&s;harp, and &s;tood to the Southward, pa&s;&s;ing clo&s;e by it, and &s;ounded again, but found no Ground.</P>
<P>This Shole is laid down in our Drafts not above 16 or 20 Leagues from <HI>New Holland;</HI> but we did run afterwards 60 Leagues due South before we fell in with it; and I am very confident, that no part of <HI>New Holland</HI> hereabouts lies &s;o far Northerly by 40 Leagues, as it is laid down in our Drafts. For if <HI>New Holland</HI> were laid down true, we mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity have been driven near 40 Leagues to the We&s;tward of our Cour&s;e; but this is very improba|ble, that the Current &s;hould &s;et &s;o &s;trong to the We&s;tward, &s;eeing we had &s;uch a con&s;tant We&s;terly Wind. I grant, that when the Mon&s;oon &s;hifts fir&s;t, the Current does not pre&s;ently &s;hift, but runs after|wards near a Month; but the Mon&s;oon had been &s;hifted at lea&s;t two Months now. But or the Mon|&s;oons and other Winds, and of the Currents, el&s;e|where, in their proper place. As to the&s;e here, I do rather believe that the Land is not laid down true, than that the Current deceived us; for it was more probable we &s;hould have been deceived before we met with the Shole, than afterwards; for on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Holland</HI> we found the Tides keeping their con&s;tant Cour&s;e; the Flood running N. by E. and the Ebb S. by E.</P>
<P>The 4th day of <HI>January,</HI> 1688. we fell in with the Land of <HI>New Holland</HI> in the Lat. of 16 d. 50 m. having, as I &s;aid before, made our Cour&s;e due South from the Shole that we pa&s;t by the 31&s;t day of <HI>December.</HI> We ran in clo&s;e by it, and finding no convenient anchoring, becau&s;e it lies open to the N. W. we ran along &s;hore to the Ea&s;tward, &s;teering N. E. by E. for &s;o the Land lies. We &s;teered thus about 12 Leagues; and then came to a Point of Land, from whence the Land trends Ea&s;t and Southerly, for 10 or 12 Leagues; but how afterwards I know not. About 3 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of this Point,
<PB N="463" REF="489">
there is a pretty deep Bay, with abundance of I|&s;lands in it, and a very good place to anchor in, or to hale a&s;hore. About a League to the Ea&s;tward of that Point we anchored <HI>January</HI> the 5th, 1688. 2 Mile from the Shore, in 29 Fathom, good hard Sand, and clean Groud.</P>
<P><HI>New Holland</HI> is a very large Tract of Land. It is not yet determined whether it is an I&s;land or a main Continent; but I am certain that it joyns neither to <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> nor <HI>America.</HI> This part of it that we &s;aw is all low even Land, with &s;andy Banks again&s;t the Sea, only the Points are rocky, and &s;o are &s;ome of the I&s;lands in this Bay.</P>
<P>The Land is of a dry &s;andy Soil, de&s;titute of Water, except you make Wells; yet producing di|vers &s;orts of Trees; but the Woods are not thick, nor the Trees very big. Mo&s;t of the Trees that we &s;aw are Dragon-trees, as we &s;uppo&s;ed; and the&s;e too are the large&s;t Trees of any there. They are about the bigne&s;s of our large Apple-trees, and about the &s;ame heighth: and the Rind is blacki&s;h, and &s;ome|what rough. The Leaves are of a dark colour; the Gum di&s;tils out of the Knots or Cracks that are in the Bodies of the Trees. We compared it with &s;ome Gum Dragon, or Dragon's Blood, that was aboard, and it was of the &s;ome colour and ta&s;te. The other &s;orts of Trees were not known by any of us. There was pretty long Gra&s;s growing under the Trees; but it was very thin. We &s;aw no Trees that bore Fruit or Berries.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no &s;ort of Animal, nor any Track of Bea&s;t, but once; and that &s;eemed to be the Tread of a Bea&s;t as big as a great Ma&s;tiff-Dog. Here are a few &s;mall Land-birds, but none bigger than a Blackbird; and but few Sea-fowls. Neither is the Sea very plentifully &s;tored with Fi&s;h, unle&s;s you reckon the Manatee and Turtle as &s;uch. Of the&s;e Creatures there is plenty; but they are extraordinary

Their Eye-lids are always half clo&s;ed, to keep the Flies out of their Eyes; they being &s;o trouble&s;ome here, that no fanning will keep them from coming to ones Face; and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of both Hands to keep them off, they will creep into ones No&s;trils, and Mouth too, if the Lips are not &s;hut very clo&s;e: So that from their Infancy being thus annoyed with the&s;e In&s;ects, they do never open their Eyes, as other People: And therefore they cannot &s;ee far, unle&s;s they hold up their Heads, as if they were looking at &s;omewhat over them.</P>
<P>They have great Bottle No&s;es, pretty full Lips, and wide Mouths. The two Fore-teeth of their Up|per-jaw are wanting in all of them, Men and Wo|men, Old and Young; whether they draw them out, I know not: Neither have they any Beards. They are long vi&s;aged, and of a very unplea&s;ing A&s;pect, having no one graceful Feature in their Faces. Their Hair is black, &s;hort and curl'd, like that of the Negroes; and not long and lank like the common <HI>Indians.</HI> The colour of their Skins, both of their Faces and the re&s;t of their Body, is coal black, like that of the Negroes of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>They have no &s;ort of Cloaths, but a piece of the Rind of a Tree ty'd like a Girdle about their Wai&s;ts, and a handful of long Gra&s;s, or 3 or 4 &s;mall green
<PB N="465" REF="491">
Boughs full of Leaves, thru&s;t under their Girdle, cover their Nakedne&s;s,</P>
<P>They have no Hou&s;es, but lie in the open Air, without any covering; the Earth being their Bed, and the Heaven their Canopy. Whether they co|habit one Man to one Woman, or promi&s;cuou&s;ly, I know not: but they do live in Companies, 20 or 30 Men, Women, and Children together. Their only Food is a &s;mall &s;ort of Fi&s;h, which they get by making Wares of Stone acro&s;s little Coves or Branches of the Sea; every Tide bringing in the &s;mall Fi&s;h, and there leaving them for a Prey to the&s;e People, who con&s;tantly attend there to &s;earch for them at Low-water. This &s;mall Fry I take to be the top of their Fi&s;hery: They have no In&s;tru|ments to catch great Fi&s;h, &s;hould they come; and &s;uch &s;eldom &s;tay to be left behind at Low-water: Nor could we catch any Fi&s;h with our Hooks and Lines all the while we lay there. In other places at Low-water they &s;eek for Cockles, Mu&s;cles, and Periwincles: Of the&s;e Shell-fi&s;h there are fewer &s;till; &s;o that their chiefe&s;t dependance is upon what the Sea leaves in their Wares; which, be it much or little, they gather up, and march to the places of their abode. There the old People that are not able to &s;tir abroad by rea&s;on of their Age, and the tender Infants, wait their return; and what Providence has be&s;towed on them, they pre&s;ently broil on the Coals, and eat it in common. Some|times they get as many Fi&s;h as makes them a plen|tiful Banquet; and at other times they &s;carce get every one a ta&s;te: But be it little or much that they get, every one has his part, as well the young and tender, the old and feeble, who are not able to go abroad, as the &s;trong and lu&s;ty. When they have eaten they lie down till the next Low-water, and then all that are able march out, be it Night or Day, rain or &s;hine, 'tis all one; they mu&s;t attend the
<PB N="466" REF="492">
Wares, or el&s;e they mu&s;t fa&s;t: For the Earth affords them no Food at all. There is neither Herb, Root, Pul&s;e, nor any &s;or of Grain fort them to eat, that we &s;aw; nor any &s;ort of Bird or Bea&s;t that they can catch, having no In&s;truments wherewithal to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I did not perceive that they did wor&s;hip any thing. The&s;e poor Creatures have a &s;ort of Wea|pon to defend their Ware, or fight with their Ene|mies, if they have any that will interfere with their poor Fi&s;hery. They did at fir&s;t endeavour with their Weapons to frighten us; who lying a&s;hore de|terr'd them from one of their Fi&s;hing-places. Some of them had wooden Swords, others had a &s;ort of Lances. The Sword is a piece of Wood &s;haped &s;omewhat like a Cutla&s;s. The Lance is a long &s;trait Pole, &s;harp at one end, and hardened after|wards by heat. I &s;aw no Iron, nor any other &s;ort of Metal; therfore it is probable they u&s;e Stone-Hatchets, as &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> do, de&s;cribed in Chap. IV.</P>
<P>How they get their Fire I know not; but, pro|bably, as <HI>Indians</HI> do, out of Wood. I have &s;een the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Bon-Airy</HI> do it, and have my &s;elf tryed the Experiment: They take a flat piece of Wood that is pretty &s;oft, and make a &s;mall dent in one &s;ide of it, then they take another hard round Stick, about the bigne&s;s of ones little Finger, and &s;harpen|ing it at one end like a Pencil, they put that &s;harp end in the hole or dent of the flat &s;oft piece, and then rubbbing or twirling the hard piece between the Palms of their Hands, they drill the &s;oft piece till it &s;moaks, and at la&s;t takes fire.</P>
<P>The&s;e People &s;peak &s;omewhat thro' the Throat, but we could not under&s;tand one word that they &s;aid. We anchored, as I &s;aid before, <HI>January</HI> the 5th, and &s;eeing Men walking on the Shore, we pre&s;ently &s;ent a Canoa to get &s;ome Acquaintance
<PB N="467" REF="493">
with them: for we were in hopes to get &s;ome Provi&s;ion among them. But the Inhabitants, &s;ee|ing our Boat coming, run away and hid them&s;elves. We &s;earched afterwards 3 Days in hopes to find their Hou&s;es; but found none: yet we &s;aw many places where they had made Fires. At la&s;t, being out of hopes to find their Habitations, we &s;earched no farther: but left a great many Toys a&s;hore, in &s;uch places where we thought that they would come. In all our &s;earch we found no Water, but old Wells on the &s;andy Bays.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we went over to the I&s;lands, and there we found a great many of the Natives: I do be|lieve there were 40 on one I&s;land, Men, Women, and Children. The Men at our fir&s;t coming a|&s;hore, threatned us with their Lances and Swords; but they were frightned by firing one Gun, which we fired purpo&s;ely to &s;care them. The I&s;land was &s;o &s;mall that they could not hide them&s;elves: but they were much di&s;ordered at our Landing, e&s;pe|cially the Women and Children: for we went di|rectly to their Camp. The lu&s;tie&s;t of the Women &s;natching up their Infants ran away howling, and the little Children run after &s;queaking and bawl|ing; but the Men &s;tood &s;till. Some of the Wo|men, and &s;uch People as could not go from us, lay &s;till by a Fire, making a doleful noi&s;e, as if we had been coming to devour them: but when they &s;aw we did not intend to harm them they were pretty quiet, and the re&s;t that fled from us at our fir&s;t coming, returned again. This their place of Dwelling was only a Fire, with a few Boughs before it, &s;et up on that &s;ide the Winds was of.</P>
<P>After we had been here a little while, the Men began to be familiar, and we cloathed &s;ome of them, de&s;igning to have had &s;ome &s;ervice of them for it: for we found &s;ome Wells of Water here, and intended to carry 2 or 3 Barrels of it aboard.
<PB N="468" REF="494">
But it being &s;omewhat trouble&s;ome to carry to the Canoas, we thought to have made the&s;e men to have carry'd it for us, and therefore we gave them &s;ome Cloaths; to one an old pair of Breeches, to another a ragged Shirt, to the third a Jacket that was &s;carce worth owning; which yet would have been very acceptable at &s;ome places where we had been, and &s;o we thought they might have been with the&s;e People. We put them on them, think|ing that this finery would have brought them to work heartily for us; and our Water being filled in &s;mall long Barrels, about 6 Gallons in each, which were made purpo&s;ely to carry Water in, we brought the&s;e our new Servants to the Wells, and put a Barrel on each of their Shoulders for them to carry to the Canoa. But all the &s;igns we could make were to no purpo&s;e, for they &s;tood like Statues, without motion, but grinn'd like &s;o many Monkies, &s;taring one upon another: For the&s;e poor Creatures &s;eem not accu&s;tomed to carry Bur|thens; and I believe that one of our Ship-boys of 10 years old, would carry as much as one of them. So we were forced to carry our Water our &s;elves, and they very fairly put the Cloaths off a|gain, and laid them down, as if Cloaths were on|ly to work in. I did not perceive that they had any great liking to them at fir&s;t, neither did they &s;eem to admire any thing that we had.</P>
<P>At another time our Canoa being among the&s;e I&s;lands &s;eeking for game, e&s;py'd a drove of the&s;e Men &s;wimming from one I&s;land to another; for they have no Boats, Canoas, or Bark-logs. They took up Four of them, and brought them aboard; two of them were middle aged, the other two were young Men about 18 or 20 Years old. To the&s;e we gave boiled Rice, and with it Turtle and Manatee boiled. They did greedily devour what we gave them, but took no notice of the Ship, or
<PB N="469" REF="495">
any thing in it, and when they were &s;et on Land again, they ran away as fa&s;t as they could. At our fir&s;t coming, before we were acquainted with them, or they with us, a Company of them who liv'd on the Main, came ju&s;t again&s;t our Ship, and &s;tanding on a pretty high Bank, threatned us with their Swords and Lances, by &s;haking them at us; at la&s;t the Captain ordered the Drum to be beaten, which was done of a &s;udden with much vigour, purpo&s;ely to &s;care the poor Creatures. They hearing the noi&s;e, ran away as fa&s;t as they could drive, and when they ran away in ha&s;te, they would cry <HI>Gurry, Gurry,</HI> &s;peaking deep in the Throat. Tho&s;e Inhabitants al&s;o that live on the Main, would always run away from us; yet we took &s;everal of them. For, as I have already ob|&s;erved, they had &s;uch bad Eyes, that they could not &s;ee us till we came clo&s;e to them. We did always give them Victuals, and let them go again, but the I&s;landers, after our fir&s;t time of being a|mong them did not &s;tir for us.</P>
<P>When we had been here about a week, we hal'd our Ship into a &s;mall &s;andy Cove, at a Spring|tide, as far as &s;he would float; and at low Water &s;he was left dry, and the Sand dry without us near half a mile; for the Sea ri&s;eth and falleth here about 5 fathom. The Flood runs North by Ea&s;t, and the Ebb South by We&s;t. All the Neep-tides we lay wholly a-ground, for the Sea did not come near us by about a hundred yards. We had there|fore time enough to clean our Ships bottom, which we did very well. Mo&s;t of our Men lay a&s;hore in a Tent, where our &s;ails were mending; and our Strikers brought home Turtle and Manatee every day, which was our con&s;tant Food.</P>
<P>While we lay here, I did endeavour to per&s;uade our Men to go to &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory; but was threatned to be turned a&s;hore, and left here for

it. This made me de&s;i&s;t, and patiently wait for &s;ome more convenient place and opportunity to leave them than here: Which I did hope I &s;hould accompli&s;h in a &s;hort time; becau&s;e they did in|tend, when they went from hence, to bear down towards Cape <HI>Comorin.</HI> In their way thither they de&s;ign'd al&s;o to vi&s;it the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> which lieth in Lat. 12 d. 12 m.

have a War with the I&s;landers; but Peace being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, they lay in Stores, and make Preparations for their Voyage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>MArch</HI> the 12th, 1688, we &s;ailed from <HI>New-Holland,</HI> with the Wind at N. N. W. and fair weather. We directed our Cour&s;e to the North|ward, intending, as I &s;aid, to touch at the I&s;land <HI>Cocos:</HI> But we met with the Winds at N. W. W. N. W. and N. N. W. for &s;everal days; which obliged us to keep a more ea&s;terly cour&s;e than was convenient to find that I&s;land. We had &s;oon after our &s;etting out very bad weather, with much Thunder and Lightning, Rain and high blu&s;tring Winds.</P>
<P>It was the 26th day of <HI>March</HI> before we were in the Lat. of the I&s;land <HI>Cocos,</HI> which is in 12 d. 12 m. and then, by Judgment, we were 40 or 50 Leagues to the Ea&s;t of it; and the Wind was now at S. W. Therefore we did rather chu&s;e to bear away to|wards &s;ome I&s;lands on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> than to beat again&s;t the Wind for the I&s;land <HI>Cocos.</HI> I was very glad of this, being in hopes to make my e&s;cape from them to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> or &s;ome other Place.</P>
<P>We met nothing of remark in this Voyage, be&s;ide the catching 2 great Sharks, till the 28th day. Then we fell in with a &s;mall woody I&s;land, in Lat. 10 d. 30 m. Its Longitude from <HI>New-Holland,</HI> from whence we came, was, by my account, 12 d. 6 m. We&s;t. It was deep Water about the I&s;land, and therefore no Anchoring; but we &s;ent two Canoas a&s;hore; one of them with the Carpenters, to cut a Tree to make another Pump; the other Canoa went to &s;earch for fre&s;h Water, and found a fine &s;mall Brook near the S. W. point of the I&s;land; but there the Sea fell in on the Shore &s;o high, that
<PB N="473" REF="499">
they could not get it off. At noon both our Ca|noas returned aboard; and the Carpenters brought aboard a good Tree, which they afterwards made a Pump with, &s;uch a one as they made at <HI>Mindanao.</HI> The other Canoa brought aboard as many Boobies and Men of War Birds, as &s;ufficed all the Ships Company, when they were boiled. They got al&s;o a &s;ort of Land-Animal, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a large Craw-fi&s;h, without its great Claws. The&s;e Crea|tures lived in holes in the dry &s;andy Ground, like Rabbits. Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in his Voyage round the World makes mention of &s;uch that he found at <HI>Ternate,</HI> or &s;ome other of the Spice I&s;lands, or near them. They were very good &s;weet Meat, and &s;o large that two of them were more than a Man could eat; being almo&s;t as thick as ones Leg. Their Shells were of a dark brown, but red when boiled.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is of a good heighth, with &s;teep Cliffs again&s;t the S. and S. W. and a &s;andy Bay on the North-&s;ide; but very deep water &s;teep to the &s;hore. The Mold is blacki&s;h, the Soil fat, producing large Trees of divers &s;orts.</P>
<P>About one a clock in the Afternoon we made &s;ail from this I&s;land, with the Wind at S. W. and we &s;teered N. W. Afterwards the Winds came a|bout at N. W. and continued between the W. N. W. and the N. N. W. &s;everal days. I ob&s;erved, that the Winds blew for the mo&s;t part out of the We&s;t, or N. W. and then we had always rainy Weather, with Tornadoes, and much Thunder and Light|ning; but when the Wind came any way to the Southward it blew but faint, and brought fair weather.</P>
<P>We met nothing of remark till the 7th day of <HI>A|pril,</HI> and then, being in Lat. 7 d. S. we &s;aw the Land of <HI>Sumatra</HI> at a great di&s;tance, bearing North. The 8th day we &s;aw the Ea&s;t-end of the I&s;land <HI>Su|matra</HI>
<PB N="474" REF="500">
very plain; we being then in Lat. 6 d. 8. The 10th day, being in Lat. 5 d. 11 m. and about 7 or 8 Leagues from the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide of it, we &s;aw abundance of Coco-nuts &s;wim|ming in the Sea; and we hoy&s;ed out our Boat, and took up &s;ome of them; as al&s;o a &s;mall Hatch, or Scuttle rather, belonging to &s;ome Bark. The Nuts were very &s;ound, and the Kernel &s;weet, and in &s;ome the Milk or Water in them, was yet &s;weet and good.</P>
<P>The 12th day we came to a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Tri&s;te,</HI> in Lat. (by Ob&s;ervation) 4 d. South; it is a|bout 14 or 15 Leagues to the We&s;t of the I&s;land <HI>Su|matra.</HI> From hence to the Northward there are a great many &s;mall uninhabited I&s;lands, lying much at the &s;ame di&s;tance from <HI>Sumatra.</HI> This I&s;land <HI>Tri&s;te</HI> is not a mile round, and &s;o low, that the Tide flows clear over it. It is of a &s;andy Soil, and full of Coco-nut Trees. The Nuts are but &s;mall; yet &s;weet enough, full, and more ponderous than I ever felt any of that bigne&s;s; notwith&s;tanding that every Spring-tide the Salt-water goes clear over the I&s;land.</P>
<P>We &s;ent a&s;hore our Canoas for Coco-nuts, and they returned aboard laden with them three times. Our Strikers al&s;o went out and &s;truck &s;ome Fi&s;h, which was boiled for Supper. They al&s;o kill'd 2 young Aligators, which was &s;alted for the next day.</P>
<P>I had no Opportunity at this place to make my E&s;cape as I would have done, and gone over hence to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> could I have kept a Boat to me. But there was no compa&s;&s;ing this; and &s;o the 15th day we went from hence, &s;teering to the Northward on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> Our Food now was Rice, and the Meat of the Coco-nuts ra&s;ped, and &s;teep'd in Water; which made a &s;ort of Milk, into which we did put our Rice, making a plea&s;ant
<PB N="475" REF="501">
Me&s;s enough. After we parted from <HI>Tri&s;te</HI> we &s;aw other &s;mall I&s;lands, that were al&s;o full of Coco-nut Trees.</P>
<P>The 19th day, being in Lat. 3 d. 25 m. S. the S. W. point of the I&s;land <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> bore N. about 5 mile di&s;t. This is a pretty large uninhabited I&s;land; in Lat. 3 d. 20 m. S. and is full of high Trees. A|bout a mile from the I&s;land <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> there is a &s;mall I&s;land full of Coco-nut Trees. There we anchored the 29th day to repleni&s;h our &s;tock of Coco-Nuts. A Riff of Rocks lies almo&s;t round this I&s;land, &s;o that our Boats could not go a&s;hore, nor come a|board at low Water; yet we got aboard four Boat-load of Nuts. This I&s;land is low like <HI>Tri&s;te,</HI> and the anchoring is on the North-&s;ide; where you have fourteen Fathom, a Mile from Shore, clean Sand.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t day we went from hence, and kept to the Northward, coa&s;ting &s;till on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and having the Winds between the W. and S. S. W. with un&s;etled Weather; &s;ome|times Rains and Tornadoes, and &s;ometimes fair Weather.</P>
<P>The 25th day we cro&s;t the Equator, &s;till coa&s;t|ing to the Northward, between the I&s;land <HI>Suma|tra,</HI> and a Range of &s;mall I&s;lands, lying 14 or 15 Leagues off it. Among&s;t all the&s;e I&s;lands, Hog-I&s;land is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. It lies in Lat. 3 d. 40 m. North. It is pretty high even Land, cloathed with tall flouri&s;hing Trees; we pa&s;t it by the 28th day.</P>
<P>The 29th we &s;aw a Sail to the North of us, which we cha&s;ed: but it being little Wind, we did not come up with her till the 30th day. Then, being within a League of her, Captain <HI>Read</HI> went into a Canoa and took her, and brought her aboard. She was a Proe with four Men in her, be|longing to <HI>Achin,</HI> whether &s;he was bound. She
<PB N="476" REF="502">
came from one of the&s;e Coco-nut I&s;lands that we pa&s;t by, and was laden with Coco-nuts, and Co|co-nut Oil. Captain <HI>Read</HI> ordered his Men to take aboard all the Nuts, and as much of the Oil as he thought convenient, and then cut a hole in the bot|tom of the Proe, and turned her loo&s;e, keeping the Men Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>It was not for the lucre of the Cargo, that Cap|tain <HI>Read</HI> took this Boat, but to hinder me and &s;ome others from going a&s;hore; for he knew that we were ready to make our e&s;capes, if an oppor|tunity pre&s;ented it &s;elf; and he thought, that by his abu&s;ing and robbing the Natives, we &s;hould be afraid to tru&s;t our &s;elves among them. But yet this proceeding of his turned to our great advantage, as &s;hall be declared hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 1&s;t, we ran down by the North We&s;t end of the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> within 7 or 8 Leagues of the Shore. All this We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Sumatra</HI> which we thus coa&s;ted along, our <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> at <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> call the <HI>We&s;t-Coa&s;t</HI> &s;imply; without adding the name of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> The Pri&s;oners who were taken the day before, &s;hewed us the I&s;lands that lie off <HI>Achin</HI> Harbour, and the Channels through which Ships go in; and told us al&s;o that there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory at <HI>Achin.</HI> I wi&s;h'd my &s;elf there, but was forced to wait with patience till my time was come.</P>
<P>We were now directing our Cour&s;e towards the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands, intending there to clean the Ship's bottom, in order to make her &s;ail well.</P>
<P>The 4th day in the evening we had &s;ight of one of the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands. The Southermo&s;t of them lies about 40 Leagues N. N. W. from the N. W. end of the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra.</HI> This mo&s;t Southerly of them is <HI>Nicobar</HI> it &s;elf, but all the clu&s;ter of I&s;lands lying South of the <HI>Audeman</HI> I&s;lands are called by our Seamen the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands.</P>

<P>Ambergrea&s;e is often found by the Native <HI>In|dians</HI> of the&s;e I&s;lands, who know it very well; as al&s;o know how to cheat ignorant Strangers with a certain mixture like it. Several of our Men bought &s;uch of them for a &s;mall Purcha&s;e. Capt. <HI>Weldon</HI> al&s;o about this time touched at &s;ome of the&s;e I&s;lands, to the North of the I&s;land where we lay; and I &s;aw a great deal of &s;uch Ambergrea&s;e, that one of his Men bought there; but it was not good, having no &s;mell at all. Yet I &s;aw &s;ome there very good and fragrant.</P>
<P>At that I&s;land where Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> was, there were two Fryers &s;ent thither to convert the <HI>Indians.</HI> One of them came away with Captain <HI>Weldon;</HI> the other remained there &s;till. He that came away with Captain <HI>Weldon,</HI> gave a very good Character of the Inhabitants of that I&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> that they were very hone&s;t, civil, harmle&s;s People; That they were not addicted to Quarrelling, Theft, or Mur|der; That they did marry, or at lea&s;t live as Man and Wife, one Man with one Woman, never chang|ing till Death made the Separation; That they were punctual and hone&s;t in performing their Bargains; And that they were inclined to receive the Chri&s;ti|an Religion. This Relation I had afterwards from the Mouth of a Prie&s;t at <HI>Tonqueen,</HI> who told me that he received this Information by a Letter from the Fryer that Captain <HI>Weldon</HI> brought away from thence. But to proceed.</P>
<P>The 5th day of <HI>May</HI> we ran down on the We&s;t|&s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Nicobar,</HI> properly &s;o called, and
<PB N="478" REF="504">
anchored at the N. W. end of it, in a &s;mall Bay in 8 Fathom Water, not half a Mile from the Shore The body of this I&s;land is in 7 d. 30 m. North Lat. it is about 12 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. The South-end of it is pretty high, with &s;teep Cliffs again&s;t the Sea; the re&s;t of the I&s;land is low, flat, and even. The Mold of it is black, and deep; and it is very well watered with &s;mall running Streams. It produceth abundance of tall Trees, fit for any u&s;es; for the whole Bulk of it &s;eems to be but one entire Grove. But that which adds mo&s;t to its Beauty off at Sea, are the many &s;pots of Coco-nut Trees which grow round it in every &s;mall Bay. The Bays are half a Mile, or a Mile long, more or le&s;s; and the&s;e Bays are intercepted, or divided from each other, with as many little rocky Points <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Woodland.</P>
<P>As the Coco-nut Trees do thus grow in Groves, fronting to the Sea, in the Bays, &s;o there is another &s;ort of Fruit-Tree in the Bays, bordering on the back-&s;ide of the Coco-Trees, farther from the Sea. It is called by the Natives, a Melory-Tree. This Tree is as big as our large Apple-Trees, and as high. It hath a blacki&s;h Rind, and a pretty broad Leaf. The Fruit is as big as the Bread-fruit at <HI>Guam,</HI> de|&s;cribed in Chapter X. or a large Penny Loaf. It is &s;haped like a Pear, and hath a pretty tough &s;mooth Rind, of a light green Colour. The in&s;ide of the Fruit is in &s;ub&s;tance much like an Apple; but full of &s;mall Strings, as big as a brown Thread. I did never &s;ee of the&s;e Trees any where but here.</P>
<P>The Natives of this I&s;land are tall well-limb'd Men, pretty long-vi&s;ag'd, with black Eyes; their No&s;es middle proportioned, and the whole Sym|metry of their Faces agreeing very well. Their Hair is black and lank, and their Skins of a dark Copper-colour. The Women have no Hair on
<PB N="479" REF="505">
their Eye-brows. I do believe it is pluckt up by the Roots; for the Men had Hair growing on their Eye-brows, as other People.</P>
<P>The Men go all naked, &s;ave only a long narrow piece of Cloth, or Sa&s;h; which going round their Wa&s;tes, and thence down between their Thighs, is brought up behind, and tuckt in at that part which goes about the Wa&s;te. The Women have a kind of a &s;hort Petticoat reaching from their Wa&s;te to their Knees.</P>
<P>Their Language was different from any that I had ever heard before; yet they had &s;ome few <HI>Malayan</HI> Words, and &s;ome of them had a Word or two of <HI>Portugueze;</HI> which probably they might learn aboard of their Ships, pa&s;&s;ing by this place: for when the&s;e Men &s;ee a Sail, they do pre&s;ently go aboard of them in their Canoas. I did not perceive any Form of Religion that they had; they had nei|ther Temple nor Idol, nor any manner of outward Veneration to any Deity, that I did &s;ee.</P>
<P>They inhabit all round the I&s;land by the Sea|&s;ide, in the Bays; there being 4 or 5 Hou&s;es, more or le&s;s, in each Bay. Their Hou&s;es are built on Po&s;ts, as the <HI>Mindanayans</HI> are. They are &s;mall, low, and of a &s;quare form. There is but one Room in each Hou&s;e, and this Room is about 8 foot from the Ground; and from thence the Roof is rai&s;ed about 8 Foot higher. But in&s;tead of a &s;harp Ridge, the top is exceeding neatly arched with &s;mall Raf|ters about the bigne&s;s of a Man's Arm, bent round like a Half-Moon, and very curiou&s;ly thatcht with Palmeto-leaves.</P>
<P>They live under no Government that I could perceive; for they &s;eem to be equal, without any di&s;tinction, every Man ruling in his own Hou&s;e. Their Plantations are only tho&s;e Coco-nut Trees which grow by the Sea&s;ide; their being no cleared Land farther in on the I&s;land: for I ob&s;erved that
<PB N="480" REF="506">
when pa&s;t the Fruit-Trees, there were no Paths to be &s;een going into the Woods. The greate&s;t u&s;e which they make of their Coco-Trees is to draw <HI>Toddy</HI> from them, of which they are very fond.</P>
<P>The Melory Trees &s;eem to grow wild; they have great Earthen Pots to boil the Melory Fruit in, which will hold 12 or 14 Gallons. The&s;e Pots they fill with the Fruit; and putting in a little Water, they cover the Mouth of the Pot with Leaves, to keep the Steam while it boils. When the Fruit is &s;oft they peel off the Rind, and &s;crape the Pulp from the Strings with a flat Stick made like a Knife; and then make it up in great Lumps as big as a <HI>Holland</HI> Chee&s;e; and then it will keep 6 or 7 days. It looks yellow, and ta&s;tes well, and is their chief|e&s;t Food: For they have no Yams, Potatoes, Rice, nor Plantains (except a very few;) yet they have a few &s;mall Hogs, and a very few Cocks and Hens, like ours. The Men employ them&s;elves in Fi&s;hing; but I did not &s;ee much Fi&s;h that they got: Every Hou&s;e hath at lea&s;t 2 or 3 Canoas belonging to it, which they draw up a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Canoas that they go a fi&s;hing in are &s;harp at both ends; and both the &s;ides and the bottom are very thin and &s;mooth. They are &s;haped &s;ome|what like the Proes at <HI>Guam,</HI> with one &s;ide flatti&s;h, and the other with a pretty big Belly; and they have &s;mall &s;light Outlagers on one &s;ide. Being thus thin and light they are better managed with Oars than with Sails: Yet they &s;ail well enough, and are &s;teer'd with a Paddle. There commonly go 20 or 30 Men in one of the&s;e Canoas; and &s;el|dom fewer than 9 or 10. Their Oars are &s;hort, and they do not paddle, but row with them, as we do. The Benches they &s;it on when they row are made of &s;plit Bamboes, laid acro&s;s, and &s;o near together, that they look like a Deck. The Bam|boes lie moveable; &s;o that when any go in to row
<PB N="481" REF="507">
they take up a Bambo in the place where they would &s;it, and lay it by to make room for their Legs. The Canoas of tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands were like tho&s;e of <HI>Nicobar:</HI> and probably they were alike in other things; for we &s;aw no dif|ference at all in the Natives of them, who came hi|ther while we were here.</P>
<P>But to proceed with our Affairs: It was, as I &s;aid before, the 5th day of <HI>May,</HI> about 10 in the Morn|ing, when we anchored at this I&s;land: Captain <HI>Read</HI> immediately ordered his Men to heel the Ship in order to clean her; which was done this Day and the next. All the Water-Ve&s;&s;els were fill'd, they intended to go to Sea at Night: For the Winds being yet at N. N. E. the Captain was in hopes to get over to Cape <HI>Comorin</HI> before the Wind &s;hifted; otherwi&s;e it would have been &s;omewhat difficult for him to get thither, becau&s;e the We&s;terly Mon|&s;oon was not at hand.</P>
<P>I thought now was my time to make my E&s;cape; by getting leave, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;tay here; for it &s;eemed not very fea&s;ible to do it by &s;tealth; and I had no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of getting leave; this being a place where my &s;tay could, probably, do our Crew no harm, &s;hould I de&s;ign it. Indeed one rea&s;on that put me on the thoughts of &s;taying at this particular place, be&s;ides the pre&s;ent oppor|tunity of leaving Captain <HI>Read,</HI> which I did al|ways intend to do, as &s;oon I could, was, that I had here al&s;o a pro&s;pect of advancing a profitable Trade for Ambergrea&s;e with the&s;e People, and of gaining a con&s;iderable Fortune to my &s;elf: For in a &s;hort time I might have learned their Language, and by accu&s;toming my &s;elf to row with them in the Proes or Canoas, e&s;pecially by conforming my &s;elf to their Cu&s;toms and Manners of Living, I &s;hould have &s;een how they got their Ambergrea&s;e, and have known what Quantities they get, and
<PB N="482" REF="508">
the time of the Year when mo&s;t is found. And then afterwards I thought it would be ea&s;ie for me to have tran&s;ported my &s;elf from thence, ei|ther in &s;ome Ship that pa&s;t this way, whether <HI>En|gli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Portugueze;</HI> or el&s;e to have gotten one of the young Men of the I&s;land to have gone with me in one of their Canoas to <HI>Achin;</HI> and there to have furni&s;hed my &s;elf with &s;uch Commodities as I found mo&s;t coveted by them; and therewith, at my return, to have bought their Ambergrea&s;e.</P>
<P>I had, till this time, made no open &s;how of go|ing a&s;hore here: But now, the Water being fill'd, and the Ship in a readine&s;s to &s;ail, I de&s;ired Cap|tain <HI>Read</HI> to &s;et me a&s;hore on this I&s;land. He, &s;up|po&s;ing that I could not go a&s;hore in a place le&s;s frequented by Ships than this, gave me leave; which probably he would have refu&s;ed to have done, if he thought I &s;hould have gotten from hence in any &s;hort time; for fear of my giving an account of him to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch.</HI> I &s;oon got up my Che&s;t and Bedding, and immediately got &s;ome to row me a&s;hore, for fear le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t his Mind &s;hould change again.</P>
<P>The Canoa that brought me a&s;hore, landed me on a &s;mall &s;andy Bay, where there were two Hou&s;es, but no Per&s;on in them: For the Inhabitants were removed to &s;ome other Hou&s;e, probably for fear of us; becau&s;e the Ship was clo&s;e by: And yet both Men and Women came aboard the Ship without any &s;ign of fear. When our Ship's Canoa was going aboard again, they met the Owner of the Hou&s;es coming a&s;hore in his Boat. He made a great many Signs to them to fetch me off again; but they would not under&s;tand him. Then he came to me, and offered his Boat to carry me off; but I refu&s;ed it. Then he made Signs for me to go up into the Hou&s;e; and, according as I did under|&s;tand him by his Signs, and a few <HI>Malayan</HI> Words
<PB N="483" REF="509">
that he u&s;ed, he intimated that &s;omewhat would come out of the Woods in the night, when I was a&s;leep, and kill me, meaning probably &s;ome wild Bea&s;t. Then I carried my Che&s;t and Cloaths up into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not been a&s;hore an hour before Captain <HI>Teat</HI> and one <HI>John Damarel,</HI> with 3 or 4 armed Men more, came to fetch me aboard again. They need not have &s;ent an armed <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> for me; for had they but &s;ent the Cabbin-boy a&s;hore for me, I would not have denied going aboard. For though I could have hid my &s;elf in the Woods, yet then they would have abu&s;ed, or have kill'd &s;ome of the Natives, purpo&s;ely to incen&s;e them again&s;t me. I told them therefore, that I was ready to go with them, and went aboard with all my Things.</P>
<P>When I came aboard I found the Ship in an up|roar; for there were 3 Men more, who taking Courage by my Example, de&s;ired leave al&s;o to ac|company me. One of them was the Surgeon Mr. <HI>Coppinger,</HI> the other was Mr. <HI>Robert Hall,</HI> and one named <HI>Ambro&s;e;</HI> I have forgot his Sir-name. The&s;e Men had always harboured the &s;ame De&s;igns as I had. The two la&s;t were not much oppo&s;ed; but Captain <HI>Read</HI> and his Crew would not part with the Surgeon. At la&s;t the Surgeon leapt into the Canoa, and taking up my Gun, &s;wore he would go a&s;hore, and that if any Man did oppo&s;e it, he would &s;hoot him: But <HI>John Oliver,</HI> who was then Quarter-ma&s;ter, leapt into the Canoa, taking hold of him, took away the Gun, and with the help of two or three more, they dragged him again into the Ship.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> and I were again &s;ent a&s;hore; and one of the Men that rowed us a&s;hore &s;tole an Ax, and gave it to us, knowing it was a good Commodity with the <HI>Indians.</HI> It was now dark, therefore we lighted a Candle, and I
<PB N="484" REF="510">
being the olde&s;t &s;tander in our new Country, conducted them into one of the Hou&s;es, where we did pre&s;ently hang up our Hammocks. We had &s;carce done this before the Canoa came a&s;hore a|gain, and brought the 4 <HI>Malayan</HI> Men belonging to <HI>Achin,</HI> (which we took in the Proe we took off of <HI>Sumatra</HI>) and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> that came to our Ship out of the <HI>Siam</HI> Jonk at <HI>Pulo Condore:</HI> the Crew having no occa&s;ion for the&s;e, being leaving the <HI>Malayan</HI> Parts, where the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Spark &s;erved as an Inter|preter; and not fearing now that the <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> could be &s;erviceable to us in bringing us over to their Country, 40 Leagues off; nor imagining that we dur&s;t make &s;uch an attempt; as indeed it was a bold one. Now we were Men enough to defend our &s;elves again&s;t the Natives of this I&s;land, if they &s;hould prove our Enemies: though if none of the&s;e Men had come a&s;hore to me, I &s;hould not have feared any danger. Nay, perhaps le&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;hould have been cautious of giving any offence to the Natives: and I am of the Opinion, that there are no People in the World &s;o barbarous as to kill a &s;ingle Per&s;on that falls accidently into their Hands, or comes to live among them; except they have before been injured, by &s;ome outrage, or vio|lence committed again&s;t them. Yet even then, or afterwards, if a Man could but pre&s;erve his Life from their fir&s;t rage, and come to treat with them (which is the harde&s;t thing becau&s;e their way is u&s;ually to ab&s;cond, and ru&s;hing &s;uddenly upon their Enemy to kill him at unawares) one might, by &s;ome &s;light, in&s;inuate ones &s;elf into their Favours again. E&s;pecially by &s;hewing &s;ome Toy, or Knack that they didnever &s;ee before: which any <HI>European,</HI> that has &s;een the World, might &s;oon contrive to amu&s;e them withal: as might be done, generally even with a little Fire &s;truck with a Flint and Steel.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="511" MS="y">
As for the common Opinion of <HI>Authropophagi,</HI> or Man-eaters, I did never meet with any &s;uch Peo|ple: All Nations or Families in the World, that I have &s;een or heard of, having &s;ome &s;ort of Food to live on, either Fruit, Grain, Pul&s;e, or Roots, which grow naturally, or el&s;e planted by them; if not Fi&s;h and Land-Animals be&s;ides; (yea, even the People of <HI>New-Holland,</HI> had Fi&s;h amid&s;t all their Penury) and would &s;carce kill a Man purpo&s;ely to eat him. I know not what barbarous Cu&s;toms may formerly have been in the World; and to Sacrifice their Enemies to their Gods, is a thing hath been much talked of, with relation to the Sa|vages of <HI>America.</HI> I am a Stranger to that al&s;o, if it be, or have been cu&s;tomary in any Nation there; and yet, if they Sacrifice their Enemies it is not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould Eat them too. After all, I will not be peremptory in the Negative, but I &s;peak as to the compa&s;s of my own Knowledge, and know &s;ome of the&s;e Cannibal Stories to be fal&s;e, and many of them have been di&s;proved &s;ince I fir&s;t went to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> At that time how Barba|rous were the poor <HI>Florida Indians</HI> accounted, whieh now we find to be Civil enough? what &s;trange Stories have we heard of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e I&s;lands were called the I&s;les of <HI>Cannibals?</HI> Yet we find that they do Trade very civilly with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and have done &s;o with us. I do own that they have formerly endeavoured to de&s;troy our Plantations at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and have &s;ince hindred us from &s;ettling the I&s;land <HI>Santa Loca,</HI> by de&s;troying two or three Colonies &s;ucce&s;&s;ively of tho&s;e that were &s;ettled there; and even the I&s;land <HI>Tabago</HI> has been often annoyed and ravaged by them, when &s;ettled by the Dutch, and &s;till lies wa&s;t (though a delicate Fruitful I&s;land) as being too near the <HI>Caribbees</HI> on the Continent, who vi&s;it it every Year. But this was to pre&s;erve their own right, by
<PB N="486" REF="512">
endeavouring to keep out any that would &s;ettle them&s;elves on tho&s;e I&s;lands, where they had plant|ed them&s;elves; yet even the&s;e People would not hurt a &s;ingle Per&s;on, as I have been told by &s;ome that have been Pri&s;oners among them. I could in&s;tance al&s;o in the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Bocca Toro,</HI> and <HI>Bocca Drago,</HI> and many other Places where they do live, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, Wild and Salvage; yet there they have been familiar with Privateers, but by A|bu&s;es have withdrawn their Friend&s;hip again. As for the&s;e <HI>Nicobar</HI> People, I found them Affable e|nough, and therefore I did not fear them; but I did not much care whether I had gotten any more Company or no.</P>
<P>But however I was very well &s;atisfied, and the rather becau&s;e we were now Men enough to row our &s;elves over to the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and accord|ingly we pre&s;ently con&s;ulted how to purcha&s;e a Ca|noa of the Natives.</P>
<P>It was a fine clear Moon-light Night, in which we were left a&s;hore. Therefore we walked on the &s;andy Bay to watch when the Ship would weigh and be gone, not thinking our &s;elves &s;ecure in our new-gotten Liberty till then. About 11 or 12 a Clock we &s;aw her under Sail, and then we returned to our Chamber, and &s;o to &s;leep. This was the 6th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning betimes, our Landlord, with 4 or 5 of his Friends, came to &s;ee his new Gue&s;ts, and was &s;omewhat &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;o many of us, for he knew of no more but my &s;elf. Yet he &s;eemed to be very well plea&s;ed, and entertain'd us with a large Calaba&s;h of Toddy, which he brought with him. Before he went away again, (for where&s;oever we came they left their Hou&s;es to us, but whether out of Fear or Super&s;tition I know not) we bought a Canoa of him for an Ax, and we did pre&s;ently put our Che&s;ts and Cloaths
<PB N="487" REF="513">
in it, de&s;igning to go to the South-end of the I&s;land, and lye there till the Mon&s;oon &s;hifted, which we expected every day.</P>
<P>When our things were &s;towed away, we with the <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> entered with joy into our new Frigot, and launched off from the Shore. We were no &s;ooner off, but our Canoa over&s;et, bottom up|wards. We pre&s;erved our Lives well enough by Swimming, and dragg'd al&s;o our Che&s;ts and Cloaths a&s;hore; but all our things were wet. I had no|thing of value but my Journal and &s;ome Drafts of Land, of my own taking, which I much prized, and which I had hitherto carefully pre&s;erved. Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> had al&s;o &s;uch another Cargo of Books and Drafts, which were now like to peri&s;h. But we pre|&s;ently opened our Che&s;ts and took out our Books, which, with much ado, we did afterwards dry; but &s;ome of our Drafts that lay loo&s;e in our Che&s;ts were &s;poiled.</P>
<P>We lay here afterwards 3 days, making great Fires to dry our Books. The <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> in the mean time fixt our Canoa, with Outlagers on each &s;ide; and they al&s;o cut a good Ma&s;t for her, and made a &s;ub&s;tantial Sail with Mats.</P>
<P>The Canoa being now very well &s;ixt, and our Books and Cloaths dry, we launched out the &s;e|cond time, and rowed towards the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, leaving many I&s;lands to the North of us. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the I&s;land accompanied us with 8 or 10 Canoas again&s;t our de&s;ire; for we thought that the&s;e Men would make Provi&s;ion dearer at that &s;ide of the I&s;land we were going to, by giving an account what rates we gave for it at the place from whence we came, which was owing to the Ships being there; for the Ships crew were not &s;o thrifty in bargaining (as they &s;eldom are) as &s;ingle Per&s;ons, or a few Men might be apt to be, who would keep to one bargain. Therefore to
<PB N="488" REF="514">
hinder them from going with us, Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> &s;cared one Canoas Crew, by firing a &s;hot over them. They all leapt over-board, and cried out, but &s;eeing us row away, they got into their Canoa again, and came after us.</P>
<P>The firing of that Gun made all the Inhabitants of the I&s;land to be our Enemies. For pre&s;ently af|ter this we put a&s;hore at a Bay where were four Hou&s;es, and a great many Canoas: but they all went away, and came near us no more for &s;eve|ral Days. We had then a great Loaf of Melory which was our con&s;tant Food; and if we had a mind to Coco-nuts, or Toddy, our <HI>Malayans</HI> of <HI>Achin</HI> would climb the Trees, and fetch as many Nuts as we would have, and a good Pot of Tod|dy every Morning. Thus we lived till our Me|lory was almo&s;t &s;pent; being &s;till in hopes that the Natives would come to us, and &s;ell it as they had formerly done. But they came not to us; nay, they oppo&s;ed us where-ever we came, and often &s;haking their Lances at us, made all the &s;hew of hatred that they could invent.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when we &s;aw that they &s;tood in oppo|&s;ition to us, we re&s;olved to u&s;e force to get &s;ome of their Food, if we could not get it other ways. With this Re&s;olution, we went in our Canoa to a &s;mall Bay, on the North part of the I&s;land; becau&s;e it was &s;mooth water there and good land|ing; but on the other &s;ide, the Wind being yet on that Quarter, we could not land without jeopardy of over&s;etting our Canoa, and wetting our Arms, and then we mu&s;t have lain at the mercy of our Enemies, who &s;tood 2 or 300 Men in every Bay, where they &s;aw us coming, to keep us off.</P>
<P>When we &s;et out, we rowed directly to the North end, and pre&s;ently were followed by 7 or 8 of their Canoas. They keeping at a di&s;tance, rowed away fa&s;ter than we did, and got to the
<PB N="489" REF="515">
Bay before us; and there, with about 20 more Ca|noas, full of Men, they all landed, and &s;tood to hinder us from landing. But we rowed in, within a hundred yards of them. Then we lay &s;till, and I took my Gun, and pre&s;ented at them; at which they all fell down flat on the Ground. But I turn'd my &s;elf about, and to &s;hew that we did not intend to harm them, I fired my Gun off to Sea; &s;o that they might &s;ee the Shot graze on the Water. A&s;&s;oon as my Gun was loaden again, we rowed gently in; at which &s;ome of them withdrew. The re&s;t &s;tand|ing up, did &s;till cut and hew the Air, making &s;igns of their hatred: till I once more frighted them with my Gun, and di&s;charg'd it as before. Then more of them &s;neak'd away, leaving only 5 or 6 Men on the Bay. Then we rowed in again, and Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> taking his Sword in his Hand, leapt a&s;hore; and I &s;tood ready with my Gun to fire at the <HI>Indians,</HI> if they had injured him: But they did not &s;tir, till he came to them and &s;aluted them.</P>
<P>He &s;hook them by the Hand, and by &s;uch &s;igns of Friend&s;hip as he made, the Peace was concluded, ra|tified and confirmed by all that were pre&s;ent: And others that were gone, were again call'd back, and they all very joyfully accepted of a Peace. This be|came univer&s;al over all the I&s;land, to the great joy of the Inhabitants. There was no ringing of Bells nor Bonfires made, for that is not the Cu&s;tom here; but Gladne&s;s appeared in their Countenances, for now they could go out and fi&s;h again, without fear of being taken. This Peace was not more welcome to them than to us; for now the Inhabitants brought their Melory again to us; which we bought for old Rags, and &s;mall &s;tripes of Cloth, about as broad as the Palm of ones Hand. I did not &s;ee abve 5 or 6 Hens, for they have but few on the I&s;land. At &s;ome places we &s;aw &s;ome &s;mall Hogs, which we could have
<PB N="490" REF="516">
bought of them rea&s;onably; but we would not offend our <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> Friends, who were Mahome|tans.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here two or three days, and then rowed toward the South-end of the I&s;land, keeping on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and we were kindly received by the Natives where-ever we came. When we arrived at the South-end of the I&s;land, we fitted our &s;elves with Melory, and Water. We bought 3 or 4 Loaves of Melory, and about 12 large Coco-nut &s;hells, that had all the Kernel taken out, yet were pre&s;erved whole, except only a &s;mall hole at one end; and all the&s;e held for us about 3 gallons and a half of Water. We bought al&s;o 2 or 3 Bamboes, that held about 4 or 5 Gallons more: This was our Sea-&s;tore.</P>
<P>We now de&s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d to go to <HI>Achin,</HI> a Town on the N.

We only waited for the We&s;tern Mon&s;oon, which we had expected a great while, and now it &s;eemed to be at hand; for the Clouds began to hang their Heads to the Fa&s;tward, and at la&s;t moved gently that way; and though the Wind was &s;till at Ea&s;t, yet this was an infalliable Sign that the We&s;tern Mon|&s;oon was nigh.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was the 15th day of <HI>May</HI> 1688. about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, when we left <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;land, directing our Cour&s;e towards <HI>Achin,</HI> being 8 Men of us in Company, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> 4 <HI>Malay|ans,</HI> who were born at <HI>Achin,</HI> and the mungrel <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el, the <HI>Nicobar</HI> Canoa, was not one of the bigge&s;t, nor of the lea&s;t &s;ize: She was much about the Burthen of one of our <HI>London</HI> Wherries below Bridge, and built &s;harp at both ends, like the fore part of a Wherry. She was deeper than a Wherry, but not &s;o broad, and was &s;o thin and light, that when empty, 4 Men could launch he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, or hale her a&s;hore on a &s;andy Bay. We had a good &s;ub&s;tantial Ma&s;t, and a Mat Sail, and good Outlagers la&s;ht very fa&s;t and firm on each &s;ide the Ve&s;&s;el, being made of &s;trong Poles. So that while the&s;e continued firm the Ve&s;&s;el could not over&s;et, which &s;he would ea&s;ily have done without them, and with them too, had they not been made very &s;trong; and we were therefore much beholding to our <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> Companions for this Contri|vance.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men were none of them &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Danger as Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> and my &s;elf, for they all con|fided &s;o much in us, that they did not &s;o much as &s;cruple any thing that we did approve of. Neither
<PB N="493" REF="519">
was Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> &s;o well provided as I was, for before we left the Ship, I had purpo&s;ely con&s;ulted our Draft of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> (for we had but one in the Ship) and out of that I had written in my Pocket|book an account of the bearing and di&s;tance of all the <HI>Malacca</HI> Coa&s;t, and that of <HI>Sumatra, Pegu,</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> and al&s;o brought away with me a Pocket-Compa&s;s for my Direction in any Enterprize that I &s;hould undertake.</P>
<P>The Weather at our &s;etting out was very fair, clear and hot. The Wind was &s;till at S. F. a ve|ry &s;mall Breeze, ju&s;t fanning the Air, and the Clouds were moving gently from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, which gave us hopes that the Winds were either at We&s;t already abroad at Sea, or would be &s;o in a ve|ry &s;hort time. We took this opportunity of fair Weather, being in hopes to accompli&s;h our Voyage to <HI>Achin,</HI> before the We&s;tern Mon&s;oon was &s;et in &s;trong, knowing that we &s;hould have very blu&s;ter|ing Weather after this fair Weather, e&s;pecially at the fir&s;t coming of the We&s;tern Mon&s;oon.</P>
<P>We rowed therefore away to the Southward, &s;uppo&s;ing that when we were clear from the I&s;land we &s;hould have a true Wind, as we call it; for the Land hales the Wind; and we often find the Wind at Sea different from what it is near the Shore. We rowed with 4 Oars, taking our turns: Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> and I &s;teered al&s;o by turns, for none of the re&s;t were capable of it. We rowed the fir&s;t Afternoon, and the Night en&s;uing, about twelve Leagues by my Judgment. Our Cour&s;e was South South Ea&s;t; but the 16th Day in the Morning, when the Sun was an Hour high, we &s;aw the I&s;land from whence we came, bearing N. W. by N. Therefore I found we had gone a point more to the Ea&s;t than I intended, for which rea&s;on we &s;teered S. by F.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="520">
In the Afternoon at 4 a Clock, we had a gentle Breeze at W. S. W. which continued &s;o till 9, all which time we laid down our Oars, and &s;teered away S. S. E. I was then at the Helm, and I found by the ripling of the Sea, that there was a &s;trong Current again&s;t us. It made a great noi&s;e that might be heard near half a Mile. At 9 a Clock it fell calm, and &s;o continued till 10. Then the Wind &s;prung up again, and blew a fre&s;h Breeze all Night.</P>
<P>The 17th Day in the Morning we lookt out for the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that we were now within 20 Leagues of it; for we had rowed and &s;ailed, by our reckoning, 24 Leagues from <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;land; and the di&s;tance from <HI>Nicobar</HI> to <HI>Achin</HI> is about 40 Leagues. But we lookt in vain for the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra;</HI> for turning our &s;elves about, we &s;aw, to our grief, <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;land, lying W. N. W. and not above 8 Leagues di&s;tant. By this it was vi&s;ible, that we had met a very &s;trong Current again&s;t us in the Night. But the Wind fre&s;hned on us, and we made the be&s;t u&s;e of it while the Wea|ther continued fair. At Noon we had an Ob&s;er|vation of the Sun, my lat. was 6 d. 55 m. and Mr. <HI>Hall</HI>'s was 7 d. N.</P>
<P>The 18th Day the Wind fre&s;hned on us again, and the Sky began to be clouded. It was indiffe|rent clear till Noon, and we thought to have had an Ob&s;ervation; but we were hindred by the Clouds that covered the Face of the Sun, when it came on the Meridian. This often happens that we are di&s;appointed of making Ob&s;ervations, by the Sun's being clouded at Noon, though it &s;hines clear both before and after, e&s;pecially in places near the Sun; and this ob&s;curing of the Sun at Noon, is commonly &s;udden and unexpected, and for about half an hour or more.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="521">
We had then al&s;o a very ill Pa&s;&s;age, by a great Circle about the Sun (5 or 6 times the Diameter of it) which &s;eldom appears, but &s;torms of Wind, or much Rain en&s;ue. Such Circles about the Moon are more frequent, but of le&s;s import. We do com|monly take great notice of the&s;e that are about the Sun, ob&s;erving if there be any Breach in the Cir|cle, and in what Quarter the Breach is; for from thence we commoly find the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s of the Wind will come. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was a little anxious at the &s;ight of this Circle, and wi&s;h'd hear|tily that we were near &s;ome Land. Yet I &s;hewed no &s;ign of it to di&s;courage my Con&s;orts, but made a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and put a good Countenance on the Matter.</P>
<P>I told Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> that if the Wind became too &s;trong and violent, as I feared it would, it being even then very &s;trong, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;teer away before the Wind and Sea, till better Wea|ther pre&s;ented; and that as the Winds were now, we &s;hould, in&s;tead of about 20 Leagues to <HI>Achin,</HI> be driven 60 and 70 Leagues to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cudda</HI> or <HI>Queda,</HI> a Kingdom, and Town, and Harbour of Trade on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>The Winds therefore bearing very hard, we rolled up the Foot of our Sail on a Pole fa&s;tned to it, and &s;ettled our Yard within three Foot of the Canoa &s;ides, &s;o that we had now but a &s;mall Sail; yet it was &s;till too big, con&s;idering the Wind; for the Wind being on our broad &s;ide, pre&s;t her down very much, tho' &s;upported by her Outlagers; in&s;o|much that the Poles of the Outlagers going from the &s;ides of their Ve&s;&s;el, bent as if they would break; and &s;hould they have broken, our over|turning and peri&s;hing had been inevitable. Be&s;ides, the Sea encrea&s;ing, would &s;oon have &s;illed the Ve&s;|&s;el this way. Yet thus we made a &s;hift to bear up with the &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el again&s;t the Wind for a
<PB N="496" REF="522">
while; But the Wind &s;till increa&s;ing, about one a Clock in the Afternoon we put away right before Wind and Sea, continuing to run thus all the Af|ternoon, and part of the Night en&s;uing. The Wind continued, increa&s;ing all the Afternoon, and the Sea &s;till &s;well'd higher, and often broke, but did us no damage; for the ends of the Ve&s;&s;el be|ing very narrow, he that &s;teered received and broke the Sea on his back, and &s;o kept it from coming in &s;o much as to endanger the Ve&s;&s;el: Though much Water would come in, which we were forced to keep heaving out continually. And by this time we &s;aw it was well that we had al|tered our Cour&s;e, every Wave would el&s;e have fill'd and &s;unk us, taking the &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el: And though our Outlagers were well la&s;h'd down to the Canoas bottom with Rattans, yet they mu&s;t pro|bably have yielded to &s;uch a Sea as this; when even before they were plunged under Water, and bent like Twigs.</P>
<P>The Evening of this 18th day was very di&s;mal. The Sky looked very black, being covered with dark Clouds, the Wind blew hard, and the Seas ran high. The Sea was already roaring in a white Foam about us; a dark Night coming on, and no Land in &s;ight to &s;helter us, and our little Ark in danger to be &s;wallowed by every Wave; and, what was wor&s;t of all, none of us thought our &s;elves prepared for another World. The Reader may better gue&s;s, than I can expre&s;s, the Confu&s;i|on that we were all in. I had been in many eminent Dangers before now, &s;ome of which I have already related, but the wor&s;t of them all was but a Play-game in compari&s;on with this. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was in great Conflicts of Mind at this time. Other Dangers came not up|on me with &s;uch a lei&s;urely and dreadful Solemni|ty. A &s;udden Skirmi&s;h or Engagement, or &s;o,
<PB N="497" REF="523">
was nothing when ones Blood was up, and pu&s;h'd forwards with eager Expectations. But here I had a lingring view of approaching Death, and little or no hopes of e&s;caping it; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that my Courage, which I had hitherto kept up, failed me here; and I made very &s;ad Reflections on my former Life, and look'd back with Horrour and Dete&s;tation, on Actions which before I di&s;|liked, but now I trembled at the remembrance of. I had long before this repented me of that roving cour&s;e of life, but never with &s;uch concern as now. I did al&s;o call to mind the many miraculous Acts of God's Providence towards me in the whole cour&s;e of my Life, of which kind I believe few Men have met with the like. For all the&s;e I re|turned Thanks in a peculiar manner, and this once more de&s;ired God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and compo&s;ed my Mind, as well as I could, in the hopes of it, and, as the Event &s;hew'd, I was not di&s;appointed of my Hopes.</P>
<P>Submitting our &s;elves therefore to God's good Providence, and taking all the care we could to pre&s;erve our Lives, Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> and I took turns to &s;teer, and the re&s;t took turns to heave out the Water; and thus we provided to &s;pend the mo&s;t doleful Night I ever was in. About 10 a clock it began to Thunder, Lighten, and Rain; but the Rain was very welcome to us, having drank up all the Water we brought from the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Wind at fir&s;t blew harder than before, but within half an hour it abated, and became more moderate; and the Sea al&s;o a&s;&s;waged of its Fury; and then by a lighted Match, of which we kept a piece burning on purpo&s;e, we looked on our Compa&s;s, to &s;ee how we &s;teered, and found our Cour&s;e to be &s;till Ea&s;t. We had no occa&s;ion to look on the Compa&s;s before, for we &s;teered right before the Wind, which if it &s;hifted we
<PB N="498" REF="524">
had been obliged to have altered our Cour&s;e ac|cordingly. But now it being abated, we found our Ve&s;&s;el lively enough with that &s;mall Sail which was then aboard, to hale to our former Cour&s;e, S. S. E. which accordingly we did, being now in hopes again to get to the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>But about 2 a clock in the Morning of the 19th day, we had another Gu&s;t of Wind, with much Thunder, Lightning and Rain, which la&s;ted till Day, and obliged us to put before the Wind a|gain, &s;teering thus for &s;everal Hours. It was very dark, and the hard Rain &s;oaked us &s;o throughly, that we had not one dry Thread about us. The Rain chill'd us extreamly; for any fre&s;h Water is much colder than that of the Sea. For even in the colde&s;t Climates the Sea is warm, and in the hotte&s;t Climates the Rain is cold and unwhol&s;e|&s;ome for Man's Body. In this wet &s;tarveling plight we &s;pent the tedious Night. Never did poor Ma|riners on a Lee-&s;hore more earne&s;tly long for the dawning Light than we did now. At length the Day appeared; but with &s;uch dark black Clouds near the Horizon, that the &s;ir&s;t glimp&s;e of the Dawn appeared 30 or 40 degrees high; which was dreadful enough; for it is a common Saying a|mong Seamen, and true, as I have experienced, that a <HI>high Dawn</HI> will have <HI>high Winds,</HI> and a <HI>low Dawn &s;mall Winds.</HI></P>
<P>We continued our Cour&s;e &s;till Ea&s;t, before Wind and Sea, till about 8 a Clock in the morning of this 19th day; and then one of our <HI>Malayan</HI> Friends cried out, <HI>Pulo Way.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> and I, thought the Fellow had &s;aid <HI>Pull away,</HI> an Ex|pre&s;&s;ion u&s;ual among <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen, when they are Rowing. And we wondered what he meant by it, till we &s;aw him point to his Con&s;orts; and then we looking that way, &s;aw Land appearing, like an I&s;land, and all our <HI>Malayans</HI> &s;aid it was an
<PB N="499" REF="525">
I&s;land at the N. W. end of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> called <HI>Way</HI> for <HI>Pulo Way,</HI> is the I&s;land <HI>Way.</HI> We, who were; dropping with Wet, Cold and Hungry, were all over joyed at the &s;ight of the Land, and pre&s;ently marked its bearing. It bore South, and the Wind was &s;till at We&s;t, a &s;trong gale; but the Sea did not run &s;o high as in the Night. Therefore we trimmed our &s;mall Sail no bigger than a Apron, and &s;teered with it. Now our Outlagers did us a great kindne&s;s again, for although we had but a &s;mall Sail, yet the Wind was &s;trong, and pre&s;t down our Ve&s;&s;el's &s;ide very much: But being &s;upported by the Outlagers, we could brook it well enough, which otherwi&s;e we could not have done.</P>
<P>About Noon we &s;aw more Land beneath the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Pulo Way;</HI> and &s;teering towards it, before Night we &s;aw all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and found the Errors of our <HI>Achine&s;c;</HI> for the high Land that we fir&s;t &s;aw, which then appear'd like an I&s;land, was not <HI>Pulo Way,</HI> but a great high Mountain on the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> called by the Engli&s;h, the <HI>Golden Mountain.</HI> Our Wind continued till about 7 a Clock at night; then it abated, and at 10 a Clock it died away: And then we &s;tuck to our Oars a|gain, tho all of us quite tired with our former Fa|tigues and Hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the 20th day, we &s;aw all the low Land plain, and judged our &s;elves not above 8 Leagues off. About 8 Clock in the Morn|ing we had the Wind again at We&s;t, a fre&s;h gale, and &s;teering in &s;till for the Shore, a 5 a Clock in the Afternoon we run to the Mouth of a River on the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra,</HI> called <HI>Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca.</HI> It is 34 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Achin,</HI> and 6 Leagues to the We&s;t of <HI>Diamond Point,</HI> which makes with three Angles of a Rhombus, and is low Land.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Malayans</HI> were very well acquainted here, and carried us to a &s;mall Fi&s;hing Village, within a
<PB N="500" REF="526">
Mile of the River's Mouth, called al&s;o by the name of the River, <HI>Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca.</HI> The Hard&s;hips of this Voyage, with the &s;corching heat of the Sun, at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, and the cold Rain, and our con|tinuing Wet for the la&s;t two days, ca&s;t us all into Fevers, &s;o that now we are not able to help each other, nor &s;o much as to get our Canoa up to the Village; but our <HI>Malayans</HI> got &s;ome of the Town&s;|men to bring her up.</P>
<P>The News of our Arrival being noi&s;ed abroad, one of the <HI>Oramkai</HI>'s, or Noblemen of the I&s;land, came in the Night to &s;ee us. We were then lying in a &s;mall Hut, at the end of the Town, and it being late, this Lord only viewed us, and having &s;poken with our <HI>Malayans,</HI> went away again; but he returned to us again the next day, and pro|vided a large Hou&s;e for us to live in, till we &s;hould be recovered of our Sickne&s;s; ordering the Towns-People to let us want for nothing. The <HI>Achine&s;e Malayans</HI> that came with us, told them all the Cir|cum&s;tances of our Voyage; how they were taken by our Ship, and where, and how we that came with them were Pri&s;oners aboard the Ship, and had been &s;et a&s;hore together at <HI>Nccobar,</HI> as they were. It was for this Rea&s;on probably, that the Gentlemen of <HI>Sumatra</HI> were thus extraordinary kind to us, to provide every thing that we had need of; nay, they would force us to accept of Pre&s;ents from them, that we knew not what to do with; as young Buffaloes, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the&s;e we would turn loo&s;e at Night, after the Gentle|men that gave them to us were gone, for we were prompted by our <HI>Achine&s;e</HI> Con&s;orts to accept of them, for fear of di&s;obliging by our Refu&s;al. But the Coco-Nuts, Plaintains, Fowls, Eggs, Fi&s;h, and Rice, we kept for our u&s;e. The <HI>Malayans</HI> that accompanied us from <HI>Nicobar,</HI> &s;eparated them|&s;elves from us now, living at one end of the Hou&s;e
<PB N="501" REF="527">
by them&s;elves, for they were <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as all tho&s;e of the Kingdom of <HI>Achin</HI> are; and though during our Pa&s;&s;age by Sea together, we made them be con|tented to drink their Water out of the &s;ame Coco|&s;hell with us; yet being now no longer under that Nece&s;&s;ity, they again took up their accu&s;tomed Ni|cety and Re&s;ervedne&s;s. They all lay &s;ick, and as their &s;ickne&s;s increa&s;ed, one of them threatened us, that if any of them died, the re&s;t would kill us, for having brought them this Voyage; yet I que|&s;tion whether they would have attempted, or the Country People have &s;uffered it. We made a &s;hift to dre&s;s our own Food, for none of the&s;e People, though they were very kind in giving us any thing that we wanted, would yet come near us, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in dre&s;&s;ing our Victuals: Nay, they would not touch any thing that we u&s;ed. We had all Fevers, and therefore took turns to dre&s;s Victuals, accord|ing as we had &s;trength to do it, or Stomachs to eat it. I found my Fever to increa&s;e, and my Head &s;o di&s;tempered, that I could &s;carce &s;tand, therefore I whetted and &s;harpened my Penkife, in order to let my &s;elf Blood; but I could not, for my Knife was too blunt.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here ten or twelve days, in hopes to recover our Health, but finding no amendment, we de&s;ired to go to <HI>Achin.</HI> But we were delayed by the Natives, who had a de&s;ire to have kept Mr <HI>Hall</HI> and my &s;elf, to Sail in their Ve&s;&s;els to <HI>Malacca, Cudda;</HI> or to other places whither they Trade. But finding us more de&s;irous to to be with our Country-men, in our Factory at <HI>Achin,</HI> they provided a large Proe to carry us thither, we not being able to manage our own Canoa. Be&s;ides, before this, three of our <HI>Ma|layan</HI> Comrades were gone very &s;ick into the Coun|try, and only one of them and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> re|mained with us, accompanying us to <HI>Achin,</HI> and they both as &s;ick as we.</P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="528">
It was the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> 1688. when we left <HI>Pa&s;&s;ange Jonca.</HI> We had 4 men to row, one to &s;teer, and a Gentleman of the Country, that went pupro&s;ely to give an Information to the Go|vernment of our Arrival. We were but three days and nights in our Pa&s;&s;age, having Sea-breezes by day, and Land-winds by night, and very fair Weather.</P>
<P>When we arrived at <HI>Achin,</HI> I was carried before the <HI>Shabander,</HI> the chief Magi&s;trate in the City. One Mr <HI>Dennis Dri&s;call,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h-man,</HI> and a Re&s;i|dent there, in the Factory which our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company had there then, was Interpreter. I be|ing weak, was &s;uffered to &s;tand in the <HI>Shabander</HI>'s Pre&s;ence: For it is their cu&s;tom to make men &s;it on the Floor, as they do, cro&s;s legg'd like Taylors: But I had not &s;trength then to pluck up my Heels in that manner. The <HI>Shabander</HI> asked of me &s;e|veral Que&s;tions, e&s;pecially how we dur&s;t adventure to come in a Canoa from the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands to <HI>Su|matra.</HI> I told him, that I had been accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hips and hazards, therefore I did with much freedom undertake it. He enquired al&s;o concern|ing our Ship, whence &s;he came, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I told him, from the <HI>South Seas;</HI> that &s;he had ranged about the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and was now gone to|wards <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> The <HI>Malayans</HI> al&s;o and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were afterward examined, and con|fimed what I declared, and in le&s;s than half an Hour, I was di&s;mi&s;t with Mr <HI>Pri&s;cal,</HI> who then lived in the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India</HI> Company's Factory. He provided a Room for us to lie in, and &s;ome Victuals.</P>
<P>Three Days after our arrival here, our <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> died of a Fever. What became of our <HI>Malayans</HI> I know not. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> lived not long after. Mr <HI>Hall</HI> al&s;o was &s;o weak, that I did not think he would
<PB N="503" REF="529">
recover. I was the be&s;t; yet &s;till very &s;ick of a Fever, and little likely to live. Therefore Mr <HI>Dri&s;|cal,</HI> and &s;ome other Engli&s;hmen, per&s;waded me to take &s;ome Purging Phy&s;ick of a <HI>Malayan</HI> Doctor. I took their advice, being willing to get Ea&s;e: But after three Do&s;es each a large Calaba&s;h of na&s;ty &s;tuff, finding no amendment, I thought to de&s;i&s;t from more Phy&s;ick: but was per&s;waded to take one Do&s;e more; which I did, and it wrought &s;o violently, that I thought it would have ended my days. I &s;truggled till I had been about 20 or 30 times at Stool: But it working &s;o quick with me, with little Intermi&s;&s;ion, and my Strength being almo&s;t &s;pent, I even threw my &s;elf down once for all, and had above 60 Stools in all before it left off working. I thought my <HI>Malayan</HI> Doctor, whom they &s;o much commended, would have killed me out-right. I con|tinued extraordinary Weak for &s;ome days after his Drenching me thus: But my Fever left me for a|bove a week: After which, it returned upon me again for a Twelve Month, and a Flux with it.</P>
<P>However, when I was a little recovered from the Effects of my Drench, I made a &s;hift to go abroad: And having been kindly invited to Capt. <HI>Bowrey</HI>'s Hou&s;e there, my fir&s;t vi&s;it was to him; who had a Ship in the Road, but lived a&s;hore. This Gentleman was extraordinary kind to us all, par|ticularly to me, and importuned me to go his Boat&s;awain to <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> whither he was bound, with a de&s;ign to &s;ell his Ship there; as I was told, though not by him&s;elf. From thence he intended to pa&s;s with the Caravan to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and &s;o home for <HI>Eng|land.</HI> His Bu&s;ine&s;s required him to &s;tay &s;ome time longer at <HI>Achin;</HI> I judge, to &s;ell &s;ome Commodities, that he had not yet di&s;po&s;ed of. Yet he cho&s;e ra|ther to leave the di&s;po&s;al of them to &s;ome Mer|chant there, and make a &s;hort trip to the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands in the mean time, and on his return to take
<PB N="504" REF="530">
in his Effects, and &s;o proceed towards <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This was a &s;udden Re&s;olution of Captain <HI>Bowry</HI>'s, pre|&s;ently after the arrival of a &s;mall Frigot from <HI>Siam,</HI> with an Amba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> to the Queen of <HI>Achin.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;ador was a <HI>French-man</HI> by Nation. The Ve&s;&s;el that he came in was but &s;mall, yet very well mann'd, and fitted for a Fight. Therefore it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed here, that Captain <HI>Bowry</HI> was afraid to lie in <HI>Achin</HI> Road, becau&s;e the <HI>Siamers</HI> were now at Wars with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he was not able to defend his Ship, if &s;hould be attack'd by them.</P>
<P>But whatever made him think of going to the <HI>Nicobar</HI> I&s;lands, he provided to Sail; and took me, Mr <HI>Hall,</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> with him; though all of us &s;o &s;ick and weak, that we could do him no &s;ervice. It was &s;ome time about the beginning of <HI>June</HI> when we &s;ailed out of <HI>Achin</HI> Road: But we met with the Winds at N. W. with turbulent Weather, which forced us back again in two days time. Yet he gave us each 12 <HI>Me&s;s</HI> apiece, a Gold Coin, each of which is about the Value of 15 <HI>d. Engli&s;h.</HI> So he gave over that De&s;ign: And &s;ome Engli&s;h Ships coming into <HI>Achin</HI> Road, he was not afraid of the <HI>Siamers</HI> who lay there.</P>
<P>After this, he again invited me to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Achin,</HI> and treated me always with Wine and good Cheer, and &s;till importuned me to go with him to <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> But I being very weak, and fearing the We&s;terly Winds would create a great deal of trouble, did not give him a po&s;itive An&s;wer; e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e I thought I might get a better Voyage in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships newly arrived, or &s;ome others now expected here. It was this Captain <HI>Bowry</HI> who &s;ent the Letter from <HI>Borneo,</HI> directed to the Chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory at <HI>Mindanto,</HI> of which mention is made in Chapter XIII.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="531">
A &s;hort time after this, Captain <HI>Welden</HI> arrived here from <HI>Fort St George,</HI> in a Ship called the <HI>Cur|tana,</HI> bound to <HI>Tonqueen.</HI> This being a more agree|able Voyage than to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> at this time of the year, be&s;ides, that the Ship was better accommodated, e&s;pecially with a Surgeon, and I being &s;till &s;ick; I therefore cho&s;e rather to &s;erve Captain <HI>Welden</HI> than Captain <HI>Bowry.</HI> But to go on with a particular ac|count of that Expedition, were to carry my Reader back again: Whom having brought thus far to|wards <HI>England</HI> in my Circum-Navigation of the Globe, I &s;hall not weary him with new Ram|bles, nor &s;o much &s;well this Volume, as I mu&s;t to de&s;cribe the Tour I made in tho&s;e remote Parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> from and to <HI>Sumatra.</HI> So that my Voyage to <HI>Tonqueen</HI> at this time, as al&s;o another to <HI>Malacca</HI> afterwards, with my ob&s;ervations in them, and the de&s;criptions of tho&s;e and the Neighbouring Countries; as well as the de&s;cription of the I&s;land <HI>Sumatra</HI> it &s;elf, and therein the Kingdom and City of <HI>Achin, Bencouli, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall refer to another place, where I may give a particular Relation of them In &s;hort, it may &s;uffice, that I &s;et out to <HI>Tonqueen</HI> with Captain <HI>Welden</HI> about <HI>July</HI> 1688. and returned to <HI>Achin</HI> in the <HI>April</HI> following.

I &s;hall only take
<PB N="506" REF="532">
notice at pre&s;ent of two Pa&s;&s;ages; which I think I ought not to omit.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that at my return from <HI>Malacca,</HI> a little before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> 1689. I found at <HI>Achin</HI> one Mr <HI>Morgan,</HI> who was one of our Ships Crew that left me a&s;hoar at <HI>Nicobar,</HI> now Mate of a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ship of <HI>Trangambar;</HI> which is a Town on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> near Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Danes:</HI> And receiving an account of our Crew from him and others, I thought it might not be ami&s;s to gratifie the Readers Curio&s;ity therewith; who would probably be de&s;irous to know the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e Ramblers, in their new intended Expedition towards the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> And withal I thought it might not be unlikely that the&s;e Papers might fall into hands of &s;ome of our <HI>London</HI> Merchants, who were concerned in fitting out that Ship; which I &s;aid formerly, was called the <HI>Cygnet of London,</HI> &s;ent on a Trading Voyage into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> under the Command of Captain <HI>Swan:</HI> And that they might be willing to have a particular Information of the fate of their Ship. And by the way, even before this meeting with Mr <HI>Morgan,</HI> while I was at <HI>Ten|queen, Jan.</HI> 1689. I met with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship in the River of <HI>Tenqueen,</HI> called the <HI>Rainbow of London.</HI> Captain <HI>Poole</HI> Commander; by who&s;e Mate, Mr <HI>Barlow,</HI> who was returning in that Ship to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I &s;ent a Pacquet, which he undertook to de|liver to the Merchants, Owners of the <HI>Cygnet,</HI> &s;ome of which he &s;aid he knew: Wherein I gave a par|ticular account of all the Cour&s;e and Tran&s;actions of their Ship, from the time of my fir&s;t meeting it in the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and going aboard it there, to its leaving me a&s;hoar at <HI>Nicobar.</HI> But I never could hear that either that, or other Letters which I &s;ent at the &s;ame time, were received.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore with <HI>Morgan</HI>'s Relation: He told me, That when they in the <HI>Cygnet</HI> went
<PB N="507" REF="533">
away from <HI>Nicobar,</HI> in pur&s;uit of their intended-Voyage to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> they directed their Cour&s;e to wards <HI>Ceylon.</HI> But not being able to Weather it, the We&s;terly Mon&s;oon being hard again&s;t them, they were oblidged to &s;eek Refre&s;hment on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel.</HI> Here this mad fickle Crew were upon new projects again. Their De&s;igns meet|ing with &s;uch delays and ob&s;tructions, that many of them grew weary of it, and about half of them went a&s;hoar. Of this number, Mr <HI>Morgan,</HI> who told me this, and Mr <HI>Herman Copinger</HI> the Surge|on, went to the <HI>Danes</HI> at <HI>Trangambar,</HI> who kindly received them. There they lived very well; and Mr <HI>Morgan</HI> was employed as a Mate in a Ship of theirs at this time to <HI>Achin:</HI> and Captain <HI>Knox</HI> tells me, that he &s;ince Commanded the <HI>Curtana,</HI> the Ship that I went in to <HI>Tonqueen,</HI> which Cap|tain <HI>Welden</HI> having &s;old to the Mogul's Subjects, they employed Mr <HI>Morgan</HI> as Captain to Trade in her for them; and it is an u&s;ual thing for the Trading <HI>Indians</HI> to hire <HI>Europeans</HI> to go Officers on board their Ships; e&s;pecially Captains and Gunners.</P>
<P>About two or three more of the&s;e that were &s;et a&s;hore, went to <HI>Fort St George;</HI> but the main body of them were for going into the Mogul's Ser|vice. Our Seamen are apt to have great notions of I know not what Profit and Advantages to be had in &s;erving the Mogul; nor do they want for fine &s;tories to encourage one another to it. It was what the&s;e men had long been thinking and talking of as a fine thing; but now they went upon it in good earne&s;t. The Place where they went a&s;hore was at a Town of the <HI>Moors:</HI> Which name our Seamen give to all the Subjects of the great Mogul, but e&s;pecially his <HI>Mahometan</HI> Subjects; cal|ling the Idolaters, <HI>Gentous</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;hbouts.</HI> At this <HI>Moors</HI> Town they got a Peun to be their Guide to
<PB N="508" REF="534">
the Mogul's neare&s;t Camp; For he hath always &s;e|veral Armies in his va&s;t Empire.</P>
<P>The&s;e Peuns are &s;ome of the <HI>Gentous</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;hbouts,</HI> who in all places along the Coa&s;t, e&s;pecially in Sea|port Towns, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to hire them|&s;elves to wait upon Strangers, be they Merchants, Seamen, or what they will. To qualifie them for &s;uch attendance; they learn the <HI>European</HI> languages, <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, French, Portugue&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> according as they have any of the Factories of the&s;e Nations in their Neighbourhood, or are vi&s;ited by their Ships. No &s;ooner doth any &s;uch Ship come to an Anchor, and the Men come a&s;hore, but a great many of the&s;e Peuns are ready to proffer their &s;ervice. 'Tis u&s;ual for the Strangers to hire their Attendance du|ring their &s;tay there, giving them about a Crown a Month of our Money, more or le&s;s. The riche&s;t &s;ort of men will ordinarily hire 2 or 3 Peuns to wait upon them; and even the common Seamen, if able, will hire one a piece to attend them, either for Convenience or O&s;tentation; or &s;ometimes one Peun between two of them. The&s;e Peuns &s;erve them in many Capacities, as Interpreters, Brokers, Servants to attend at Meals, and go to Market, and on Errands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor do they give any trouble, eating at their own Homes, and Lodging there; when they have done their Ma&s;ters bu&s;ine&s;s for them, expecting nothing but their Wages, except that they have a certain allowance of about a Fanam, or 3 <HI>d.</HI> in a Dollar, which is an 18th part profit, by way of Brokerage for every Bargain they drive; they being generally employed in Buying and Selling. When the Strangers go away, their Peuns de&s;ire them to give them their Names in Writing, with a Certificate of their hone&s;t and diligent &s;erving 'em: And the&s;e they &s;hew to the next Comers, to get into Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;ome being able to produce a large Scrowl of &s;uch Certificates.</P>

But to proceed the <HI>Moors</HI> Town, where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> men landed, was not far from <HI>Cunnimere,</HI> a &s;mall Engli&s;h Factory on the <HI>Coromondel</HI> Coa&s;t. The Go|vernour whereof having intelligence by the <HI>Moors</HI> of the landing of the&s;e men, and their intended March to the Mogul's Camp, &s;ent out a Captain with his Company to oppo&s;e it. He came up with them, and gave them hard Words: But they being 30 or 40 re&s;olute Fellows, not ea&s;ily daunted, he dur&s;t not attack them, but returned to the Gover|nour, and the News of it was &s;oon carried to <HI>Fort St George.</HI> During their March, <HI>John Oliver,</HI> who was one of them, privately told the Peun who guided them, that him&s;elf was their Captain. So when they came to the Camp, the Peun told this to the General: And when their Stations and Pay were a&s;&s;igned them, <HI>John Oliver</HI> had a greater re|&s;pect paid him than the re&s;t; and whereas their Pay was ten Pagodas a Month each Man, (a Pagoda is two Dollar, or 9 <HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h) his Pay was twenty Pagodas: Which Stratagem and U&s;urpation of his, occa&s;ioned him no &s;mall Envy and Indignation from his Comrades.</P>
<P>Soon after this, 2 or 3 of them went to <HI>Agra,</HI> to be of the Mogul's Guard. A while after the Go|vernour of <HI>Fort St George</HI> &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the main Body of them, and a Pardon, to withdraw them from thence; which mo&s;t of them accepted, and came away. <HI>John Oliver,</HI> and the &s;mall remainder, continued in the Country; but leaving the Camp, went up and down plundering the Villages, and fleeing when they were pur&s;ued; and this was the la&s;t News I heard of them. This Account I had partly by Mr <HI>Morgan,</HI> from &s;ome of tho&s;e De&s;er|ters he met with at <HI>Trangambar;</HI> partly from others of them, whom I met with my &s;elf afterwards at <HI>Fort St George.</HI> And the&s;e were the Adventures of tho&s;e who went up into the Country.</P>

Captain <HI>Read</HI> having thus lo&s;t the be&s;t half of his Men, &s;ailed away with the re&s;t of them, after ha|ving filled his Water, and got Rice, &s;till intending for the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> When they were near <HI>Ceylon,</HI> they met with a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship richly laden, out of which they took what they pleas'd, and then turn'd her away again.

But the Strangers of Capt <HI>Freke</HI>'s Ship, who kept &s;till aboard the <HI>Cygnet,</HI> undertook to carry her for <HI>Eng|land:</HI> and the la&s;t News I heard of the <HI>Cygnet</HI> was from Captain <HI>Knox,</HI> who tells me, that &s;he now lies &s;unk in St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI>'s Bay in <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> This Digre&s;&s;ion I have made, to give an account of our Ship.</P>
<P>The other Pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall &s;peak of, that occurred during this interval of the Tour l made from <HI>Achin,</HI> is with relation to the Painted Prince, whom I brought with me into <HI>England,</HI> and who died at <HI>Oxford.</HI> For while I was at <HI>Fort St George,</HI> about <HI>April,</HI> 1690, there arrived a Ship called the <HI>Min|danao</HI> Merchant, laden with Clove-bark from <HI>Min|danao.</HI> Three of Capt. <HI>Swan</HI>'s men, that remain'd there when we went from thence, came in her: From whom I had the account of Captain <HI>Swan</HI>'s death, as is before related. There was al&s;o one Mr. <HI>Moody,</HI> who was Supercargo of the Ship. This Gentle|man bought at <HI>Mindanao</HI> the Painted Prince <HI>Jeoly</HI> (mentioned in Chapter XIII.) and his Mother; and brought them to <HI>Fort St George,</HI> where they were much admired by all that &s;aw them. Some time after this, Mr <HI>Moody,</HI> who &s;poke the <HI>Malay|an</HI> Language very well, and was a per&s;on very capa|ble to manage the Company's Affairs, was ordered by the Governour of <HI>Fort St George</HI> to prepare to go to <HI>Indrapore,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory on the We&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> in order to &s;ucceed Mr <HI>Gibbons,</HI> who was chief of that Place.</P>
<P>By this time I was very intimately acquainted with Mr <HI>Moody,</HI> and was importun'd by him to go with him, and to be Gunner of the Fort there. I
<PB N="512" REF="538">
always told him I had a great de&s;ire to go to the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and that I had now an offer to go thither with Capt. <HI>Metcalf,</HI> who wanted a Mate and had already &s;poke to me. Mr <HI>Moody,</HI> to en|courage me to go with him, told me, that if I would go with him to <HI>Indrapore,</HI> he would buy a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el there, and &s;end me to the I&s;land <HI>Mean|gis,</HI> Commander of her; and that I &s;hould carry Prince <HI>Jeoly</HI> and his Mother with me (that being their Country) by which means I might gain a Commerce with his People for Cloves.</P>
<P>This was a de&s;ign that I liked very well, and there|fore I con&s;ented to go thither. It was &s;ome time in <HI>July</HI> 1690. when we went from <HI>Fort St George</HI> in a &s;mall Ship, called the <HI>Diamond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Howel</HI> Commander. We were about 50 or 60 Pa&s;&s;engers, in all; &s;ome ordered to be left at <HI>Indrapore,</HI> and &s;ome at <HI>Bencouli:</HI> Five or &s;ix of us were Officers, the re&s;t Soldiers to the Company. We met nothing in our Voyage that de&s;erves notice, till we came abre&s;t of <HI>Indrapore.</HI> And then the wind came at N. W. and blew &s;o hard that we could not get in, but were forced to bear away to <HI>Bencouli,</HI> another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fa|ctory on the &s;ame Coa&s;t, lying 50 or 60 Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Indrapore.</HI></P>
<P>Upon our arrival at <HI>Bencouli</HI> we &s;aluted the Fort, and were welcomed by them. The &s;ame day we came to an Anchor, and Captain <HI>Howel,</HI> and Mr <HI>Moody</HI> with the other Merchants went a&s;hoar, and were all kindly received by the Covernour of the Fort. It was two days before I went a&s;hoar and then I was importuned by the Gover|nour to &s;tay there, to be Gunner of this Fort; be|cau&s;e the Gunner was lately dead: And this being a place of greater import than <HI>Indrapore,</HI> I &s;hould do the Company more Service here than there. I told the Governour, if he would augment my Sallary, which by Agreement with the Governour of
<PB N="513" REF="539">
<HI>Fort St George</HI> I was to have had at <HI>Indrapore,</HI> I was willing to &s;erve him, provided Mr <HI>Moody</HI> would con&s;ent to it. As to my Sallary, he told me, I &s;hould have 24 Dollars <HI>per</HI> month, which was as much as he gave to the old Gunner.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Moody</HI> gave no An&s;wer till a Week after, and then, being ready to be gone to <HI>Indrapore,</HI> he told me I might u&s;e my own Liberty, either to &s;tay here, or go with him to <HI>Indrapore.</HI> He added, that if I went with him, he was not certain, as yet, to perform his promi&s;e, in getting a Ve&s;&s;el for me to go to <HI>Meangas,</HI> with <HI>Jeoly</HI> and his Mother: But he would be &s;o fair to me, that becau&s;e I left <HI>Maderas</HI> on his account, he would give me the half &s;hare of the two Painted People, and leave them in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and at my Di&s;po&s;al. I accepted of the Offer, and Writings were immediatly drawn be|tween us.</P>
<P>Thus it was that I came to have this Painted Prince, who&s;e Name was <HI>Jeoly,</HI> and his Mother. They were born on a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Meangis,</HI> which is once or twice mentioned in Chap. XIII. I &s;aw the I&s;land twice, and two more clo&s;e by it: Each of the three &s;eemed to be about four or five Leagues round, and of a good heighth. <HI>Jeoly</HI> him&s;elf told me, that they all three abounded with Gold, Cloves, and Nutmegs: For I &s;hewed him &s;ome of each &s;ort &s;everal times, and he told me in the <HI>Ma|layan</HI> Language, which he &s;pake indifferent well, <HI>Meangis Hadda Madochala &s;e Bullawan:</HI> That is, there is abundance of Gold at <HI>Meangis. Bullawan,</HI> I have ob&s;erved to be the common word for Gold at <HI>Mindanao;</HI> but whether the pro|per <HI>Malayan</HI> word I know not, for I found much difference between the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language as it was &s;poken at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and the Language on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malacca</HI> and <HI>Achin.</HI> When I &s;hewed him Spice, he would not only tell me, that there was
<PB N="514" REF="540">
<HI>Madochala,</HI> that is, abundance; but to make it ap|pear more plain, he would al&s;o &s;hew me the Hair of his Head, a thing frequent among all the <HI>Indians</HI> that I have met with, to &s;hew their Hair, when they would expre&s;s more than they can number. He told me al&s;o, that his Father was <HI>Raja</HI> of the I&s;land where they lived: That there were not above Thirty Men on the I&s;land, and about one Hun|dred Women: That he him&s;elf had 5 Wives and eight Children, and that one of his Wives painted him.</P>
<P>He was painted all down the Brrea&s;t, between his Shoulders behind; on his Thighs (mo&s;tly) be|fore; and in the form of &s;everal broad Rings, or Bracelets, round his Arms and Legs. I cannot liken the Drawings to any Figure of Animals, or the like; but they were very curious, full of great variety of Lines, Flouri&s;hes, Chequered Work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> keeping a very graceful Proportion, and appearing very Artificial, even to wonder, e&s;pecially that upon and between his Shoulder-blades. By the Account he gave me of the manner of doing it, I under&s;tood that the Painting was done in the &s;ame manner, as the <HI>Jeru&s;alem-cro&s;s</HI> is made in Mens Arms, by pricking the Skin, and rubbing in a Pig|ment. But whereas Powder is u&s;ed in mak|ing the <HI>Jeru&s;alem-cro&s;s,</HI> they at <HI>Meangis</HI> u&s;e the Gum of a Tree beaten to Powder, called by <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Dammer, which is u&s;ed in&s;tead of Pitch in many Parts of <HI>India.</HI> He told me, that mo&s;t of the Men and Women on the I&s;land were thus painted: And al&s;o that they had all Ear Rings made of Gold, and Gold Shaekles about their Legs and Arms: That their common Food, of the Produce of the Land, was Potatoes and Yames: That they had plenty of Cocks and Hens; but no other tame Fowl. He &s;aid, that Fi&s;h (of which he was a great Lover, as wild <HI>Indians</HI> generally are) was very plentiful
<PB N="515" REF="541">
about the I&s;land: and that they had Canoas, and went a fi&s;hing frequently in them; and that they often vi&s;ited the other two &s;mall I&s;lands, who&s;e inhabitants &s;peak the &s;ame Language as they did; which was &s;o unlike the <HI>Malayan,</HI> which he had learnt while he was a Slave at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> that when his Mother and he were talking together in their <HI>Meangian</HI> Tongue, I could not under&s;tand one Word they &s;aid. And indeed all the <HI>Indians</HI> who &s;peak <HI>Malayan,</HI> who are the Trading and po|liter &s;ort, lookt on the&s;e <HI>Meangians</HI> as a kind of <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and upon any occa&s;ion of di&s;like, would call them <HI>Bobby,</HI> that is Hoggs; the greate&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion of Contempt that can be; e&s;pecially from the mouth of <HI>Malayans,</HI> who are generally <HI>Mahometans:</HI> and yet the <HI>Malayans</HI> every where call a Woman <HI>Babby,</HI> by a name not much different: and <HI>Mamma</HI> &s;ignifies a Man. Tho' the&s;e two la&s;t words proper|ly denote Male and Female: And as <HI>Ejam</HI> &s;ignifies a Fowl, &s;o <HI>Ejam Mamma</HI> is a Cock, and <HI>Ejam Babbi</HI> is a Hen. But this by the way.</P>
<P>He &s;aid al&s;o that the Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e other I&s;les, and their manner of living, was like theirs, and that they were the only People with whom they had any Conver&s;e: And that one time, as he, with his Father, Mother and Brother, with two or three Men more, were going to one of the&s;e other I&s;lands, they were driven by a &s;trong Wind on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mindanao,</HI> where they were taken by the Fi&s;hermen of that I&s;land, and carried a&s;hoar, and &s;old as Slaves; they being fir&s;t &s;tript of their Gold Ornaments. I did not &s;ee any of the Gold that they wore, but there were great holes in their Ears, by which it was manife&s;t that they had worn &s;ome Ornaments in them. <HI>Jeoly</HI> was &s;old to one <HI>Michael</HI> a <HI>Mindanayan,</HI> that &s;poke good <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and commonly waited on <HI>Raja Laut,</HI> &s;erving him as our Interpreter, where the <HI>Raja</HI> was at a lo&s;s in any
<PB N="516" REF="542">
word, for <HI>Michael</HI> under&s;tood it better. He did often beat and abu&s;e his painted Servant, to make him work, but all in vain; for neither fair means, threats nor blows, would make him work, as he would have him. Yet he was very timerous, and could not endure to &s;ee any &s;ort of Weapons; and he often told me that they had no Arms at <HI>Meangis,</HI> they having no Enemies to fight with.</P>
<P>I knew this <HI>Michael</HI> very well, while we were at <HI>Mindanao:</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e that Name was given him by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who baptized many of them at the time when they had footing at that I&s;land: But at the deparrure of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they were <HI>Mahometans</HI> again as before. Some of our People lay at this <HI>Michael</HI>'s hou&s;e, who&s;e Wife and Daugh|ter were <HI>Pagallies</HI> to &s;ome of them. I often &s;aw <HI>Jeoly</HI> at his Ma&s;ter <HI>Michael</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and when I came to have him &s;o long after, he remembred me again. I did never &s;ee his Father nor Brother, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> any of the others that were taken with them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Jeoly</HI> came &s;everal times aboard our Ship when we lay at <HI>Mindanao,</HI> and gladly accepted of &s;uch Victu|als as we gave him; for his Ma&s;ter kept him at very &s;hort Commons.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Jeoly</HI> lived thus a Slave at <HI>Mindanao</HI> 4 or 5 Years, till at la&s;t Mr <HI>Moody</HI> bought him and his Mother for 60 Dollars, and, as is before related, carried him to <HI>Fort St George,</HI> and from thence a|long with me to <HI>Bencouli.</HI> Mr <HI>Moody</HI> &s;tayed at <HI>Bencouli</HI> about three weeks, and then went back with Captain <HI>Howel,</HI> to <HI>Indrapore,</HI> leaving <HI>Jeoly</HI> and his Mother with me. They lived in a Hou&s;e by them&s;elves without the Fort. I had no employ|ment for them; but they both employed them|&s;elves. She u&s;ed to make and mend their own Cloaths, at which &s;he was not very expert, for they wear no Cloaths at <HI>Meangis,</HI> but only a Claoth about their Wa&s;tes: And he bu&s;ied him&s;elf in
<PB N="517" REF="543">
making a Che&s;t with 4 Boards, and a few Nails that he begged of me. It was but an ill &s;haped odd thing, yet he was as proud of it as if it had been the rare&s;t piece in the World. After &s;ome time they were both taken &s;ick, and though I took as much care of them as if they had been my Bro|ther and Si&s;ter, yet &s;he died. I did what I could to comfort <HI>Jeoly;</HI> but he took on extreamly, in&s;o|much that I feared him al&s;o. Therefore I cau&s;ed a Grave to be made pre&s;ently, to hide her out of his &s;ight. I had her &s;hrowded decently in a piece of new Callico; but <HI>Jeoly</HI> was not &s;o &s;atisfied, for he wrapped all her Cloaths about her, and two new pieces of Chints that Mr <HI>Moody</HI> gave her, &s;aying that they were his Mothers, and &s;he mu&s;t have 'em. I would not di&s;oblige him for fear of endangering his Life; and I u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to recover his health: but I found little amendment while we &s;tay'd here.</P>
<P>In the little Printed Relation that was made of him when he was &s;hewn for a Sight in <HI>England,</HI> there was a Romantick Story of a Beautiful Si&s;ter of his a Slave with them at <HI>Mindanao;</HI> and of the Sultans falling in Love with her; but the&s;e were Stories indeed. They reported al&s;o that his Paint was of &s;uch Vertue, that Serpents and Venemous Creatures would flee from him, for which rea|&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, they repre&s;ented &s;o many Serpents &s;campering about in the Printed Picture that was made of him. But I never knew any Paint of &s;uch Vertue: and as for <HI>Jeoly,</HI> I have &s;een him as much afraid of Snakes, Scorpions, or Centapees, as my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Having given this account of the Ship that left me at <HI>Nicobar,</HI> and of my Painted Prince whom I brought with me to <HI>Bencouli,</HI> I &s;hall now proceed on with the Relation of my Voyage thence to <HI>En|gland,</HI> after I have given this &s;hort Account
<PB N="518" REF="544">
of the occa&s;ion of it, and the manner of my get|ting away.</P>
<P>To &s;ay nothing therefore now of that place, and my Employment there as Gunner of the Fort, the Year 1690. drew towards an end, and not finding the Governour keep to his agreement with me, nor &s;eeing by his carriage towards others any great rea&s;on I had to expect he would, I began to wi&s;h my &s;elf away again. I &s;aw &s;o much Igno|rance in him, with re&s;pect to his charge, being much fitter to be a Book-keeper than Governour of a Fort; and yet &s;o much in&s;olence and cruelty with re&s;pect to tho&s;e under him, and ra&s;hne&s;s in his management of the <HI>Malayan</HI> Neighbourhood, that I &s;oon grew weary of him, not thinking my &s;elf very &s;afe, indeed, under a Man who&s;e hu|mours were &s;o bruti&s;h and barbarous. I forbear to mention his name after &s;uch a Character; nor do I care to fill the&s;e Papers with particular &s;tories of him: But therefore give this intimation, becau&s;e as it is the intere&s;t of the Nation in general, &s;o is it e&s;pecially of the Honourable <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Compa|ny, to be informed of abu&s;es in their Factories. And I think the Company might receive great ad|vantage by &s;trictly enquiring into the behaviour of tho&s;e wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> they entru&s;t with any Command.

I &s;peak not this out of di&s;gu&s;t to this particular Governour; much le&s;s would I &s;eem to reflect on any others, of whom I know nothing a+mi&s;s: But as it is not to be wondered at, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould not know how to demean them&s;elves in places of Power, for which neither their Education nor their bu&s;ine&s;s po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ufficiently qualified them, &s;o it will be the more nece&s;&s;ary for the Honourable Company to have the clo&s;er eye over them, and as much as may be, to prevent or re|form any abu&s;es they may be guilty of; and 'tis purely out of my Zeal for theirs and the Nation's intere&s;t, that I have given this caution, having &s;een too much occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>I had other Motives al&s;o for my going away. I began to long after my Native Country, after &s;o tedious a ramble from it: and I propo&s;ed no &s;mall advantage to my &s;elf from my Painted Prince whom Mr <HI>Moody</HI> had left entirely to my di&s;po&s;al, only re&s;erving to him&s;elf his right to one half &s;hare in him. For be&s;ide what might be gained by &s;hew|ing him in <HI>England,</HI> I was in hopes that when I had got &s;ome Money, I might there obtain what I had in vain &s;ought for in the <HI>Indies, viz.</HI> A Ship from the Merchants, wherewith to carry him back to <HI>Meangis,</HI> and re-in&s;tate him there in his own Country, and by his Favour and Negotiation to e&s;tabli&s;h a traffick for the Spices and other products of tho&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Projects, I went to the Governour and Council, and de&s;ired that I might have my di&s;charge to go for <HI>England</HI> with the next Ship that came. The Council <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hought it re&s;onable, and they con&s;ented to it; he al&s;o give me his word
<PB N="520" REF="546">
that I &s;hould go. Upon the 2d of <HI>January,</HI> 1691. there came to Anchor in <HI>Bencouli</HI> Road, the <HI>Defence,</HI> Captain <HI>Heath</HI> Commander, bound for <HI>England,</HI> in te &s;ervice of the Company. They had been at <HI>Indrapore,</HI> where Mr <HI>Moody</HI> then was, and he had made over his &s;hare in Prince <HI>Jeoly</HI> to Mr <HI>Goddard</HI> chief Mate of the Ship Upon his coming on &s;hoar, he &s;hewed me Mr <HI>Moody</HI>'s wri|tings, and lookt upon <HI>Jeoly,</HI> who had been &s;ick for 3 Months: in all which time I tended him as carefully as if he had been my Brother. I agreed matters with Mr <HI>Goddard,</HI> and &s;ent <HI>Jeoly</HI> on board, intending to follow him as I could, and de&s;iring Mr <HI>Goddard</HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance to fetch me off, and con|ceal me aboard the Ship, if there &s;hould be occa|&s;ion; which he promi&s;ed to do, and the Captain promi&s;ed to entertain me. For it proved, as I had fore&s;een, that upon Captain <HI>Heath</HI>'s arrival, the Governor repented him of of his Promi&s;e, and would not &s;uffer me to depart. I importun'd him all I could; but in vain: &s;o did Captain <HI>Heath</HI> al&s;o, but to no purpo&s;e. In &s;hort, after &s;everal e&s;&s;ays, I &s;lipt away, at midnight (under&s;tanding the Ship was to &s;ail away the next morning, and that they had taken leave of the Fort) and creeping through one of the Port-holes of the Fort, I got to the &s;hoar, where the Ships Boat waited for me, and carried me on board. I brought with me my Journal, and mo&s;t of my written Papers: but &s;ome Papers and Books of value I left in ha&s;te, and all my Furniture; being glad I was my &s;elf at liberty, and had hopes of &s;eeing <HI>England</HI> again.</P>

<PB N="522" REF="548">
meet 3 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships more, bound home from the <HI>Indies:</HI> for the War with the <HI>French</HI> having been proclaimed at <HI>Fort St George,</HI> a little before Cap|tain <HI>Heath</HI> came from thence, he was willing to have company home, if he could.</P>
<P>A little before this War was proclaimed, there was an Engagement in the Road of <HI>Fort St George</HI> between &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Men of War and &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships at anchor in the Road: which, becau&s;e there is &s;uch a plau&s;ible Story made of it in Mon&s;ieur <HI>Duque&s;ne</HI>'s late Voyage to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> I &s;hall give a &s;hort account of, as I had it particu|larly related to me by the Gunners Mate of Capt. <HI>Heath</HI>'s Ship, a very &s;en&s;ible Man, and &s;everal o|thers of his Men, who were in the Action. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Fort on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> called <HI>Pallacat,</HI> about 20 Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Fort St George.</HI> Upon &s;ome occa&s;ion or other the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Ships thither to fetch away their effects, and tran&s;port them to <HI>Batavia</HI> Acts of Ho&s;tility were already begun between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had at this time a Squa|dron newly arrived in <HI>India,</HI> and lying at <HI>Ponticheri,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Fort on the &s;ame Coa&s;t, Southward of <HI>Fort St George.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> in returning to <HI>Batavia,</HI> were obliged to coa&s;t it along by <HI>Fort St George</HI> and <HI>Ponticheri,</HI> for the &s;ake of the Wind: but when they came near this la&s;t, they &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Men of War lying at Anchor there; and &s;hould they have proceeded along the Shore, or &s;tood out to Sea, expected to be pur&s;ued by them. They there|fore turned back again; for though their Ships were of a pretty good force, yet were they un&s;it for Fight, as having great Loads of Goods, and many Pa&s;&s;engers, Women and Children, on board; &s;o they put in at <HI>Fort St George,</HI> and de&s;iring the Go|vernours Protection, had leave to anchor in the Road, and to &s;end their Goods and u&s;ele&s;s People
<PB N="523" REF="549">
a&s;hore. There were then in the Road a few &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships: and Capt. <HI>Heath,</HI> who&s;e Ship was a very &s;tout Merchant man, and which the <HI>French</HI> Relater calls the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral, was ju&s;t come from <HI>China;</HI> but very deep laden with Goods, and the Deck full of Cani&s;ters of Sugar, which he was preparing to &s;end a&s;hore. But before he could do it, the <HI>French</HI> appeared; coming into the Road with their lower Sails and top Sails, and had with them a Fire&s;hip. With this they thought to have burnt the <HI>Dutch-Commodore,</HI> and might probably enough have done it as &s;he lay at Anchor, if they had had the courage to have come boldly on; but they fired their Ship at a di&s;tance, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent and towed her away, where &s;he &s;pent her &s;elf without any execution. Had the <HI>French</HI> Men of War al&s;o come boldly up, and grappled with their Enemies, they might have done &s;omething con&s;iderable, for the Fort could not have played on them, without damaging our Ships as well as theirs. But in&s;tead of this, the <HI>French</HI> dropt An|chor out of reach of the &s;hot of the Fort, and there lay exchanging &s;hot with their Enemies Ships, with &s;o little advantage to them&s;elves, that after about four hours fighting, they cut their Cables, and went away in ha&s;te and di&s;order, with all their Sails loo&s;e, even their Top gallant Sails, which is not u&s;ual, but when Ships are ju&s;t next to running away.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Heath,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Ship was &s;o heavy and incumbred, behaved him&s;elf very brave|ly in the &s;ight; and upon the going off of the <HI>French</HI> went aboard the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodore and told him, that if he would pur&s;ue them, he wou'd &s;tand out with them to Sea, though he had very little Water aboard; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commander excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying he had orders to defend him&s;elf from the <HI>French,</HI> but none to cha&s;e them,

or go out of his way to &s;eek them. And this was the Exploit which the <HI>French</HI> have thought fit to brag of. I hear that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have taken from them &s;ince their Fort of <HI>Ponticheri.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed with our Voyage: We had not been at Sea long before our men began to droop, in a &s;ort of a Di&s;temper that &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly on them, and proved fatal to above thirty who died before we arrived at the Cape. We had &s;ome|times two, and once three men thrown over board in a morning. This Di&s;temper might probably ari&s;e from the badne&s;s of the Water, which we took in at <HI>Bencouli:</HI> For I did ob&s;erve while I was there, that the River water, wherewith our Ships were watered, was very unwhole&s;ome, it being mixt with the Water of many &s;mall Creeks, that proceeded from low Land, and who&s;e Streams were always very black, they being nouri&s;hed by the Water that drained out of the low &s;wampy un|whole&s;ome Ground.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved not only there, but in other hot Countries al&s;o both in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> that the Land-floods which pour into the Channels of the Rivers, about the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains, are very unwhol&s;ome. For when I lived in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> the Fi&s;h were found dead in heaps on the &s;hores of the Rivers and Creeks, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on; and many we took up half dead; of which &s;udden mortality there appeared no cau&s;e, but only the malignity of the Waters draining off the Land. This happens chiefly, as I take it, where the Wa|ter drains through thick Woods, and Savannahs of long Gra&s;s, and &s;wampy Grounds, with which &s;ome hot Countries abound: And I believe it re|ceives a &s;trong Tincture from the Roots of &s;everal kind of Trees, Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and e&s;pecially where there is any &s;tagnancy of the Water, it &s;oon cor|rupts; and po&s;&s;ibly the Serpents and other poi&s;on|ous
<PB N="525" REF="551">
Vermin and In&s;ects may not a little contribute to its bad Qualities: at &s;uch times it will look very deep coloured, yellow, red, or black, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;ea&s;on of the Rains was over, and the Land-floods were abating upon the taking up this Water in the River of <HI>Bencouli:</HI> but would the Seamen have given them&s;elves the trouble they might have fill'd their Ve&s;&s;els with excellent good Water at a Spring on the back&s;ide of the Fort, not above 2 or 300 paces from the Landing place; and with which the Fort is &s;erved. And I mention this as a caution to any Ships that &s;hall go to <HI>Bencouli</HI> for the future; and withal I think it worth the care of the Owners or Governours of the Factory, and that it would tend much to the pre&s;ervation of their Seamen's lives, to lay Pipes to convey the Fountain Water to the Shore, which might ea&s;ily be done with a &s;mall charge: and had I &s;taid longer there I would have undertaken it. I had a de&s;ign al&s;o of bringing it into the Fort, tho much higher: for it would be a great convenience and &s;ecurity to it, in ca&s;e of a Siege.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the badne&s;s of our Water, it was &s;towed among the Pepper in the Hold, which made it very hot. Every Morning when we came to take our Allowance, it was &s;o hot that a man could hardly &s;uffer his hands in it, or hold a Bottle full of it in his hand. I never any where felt the like, nor could have thought it po&s;&s;ible that Water &s;hould heat to that degree in a Ships Hold. It was ex|ceeding black too, and looked more like Ink than Water. Whether it grew &s;o black with &s;tanding, or was tinged with the Pepper, I know not, for this Water was not &s;o black when it was fir&s;t taken up. Our Food al&s;o was very bad; for the Ship had been out of <HI>England</HI> upon this Voyage above three Years; and the &s;alt Provi&s;ion brought from thence, and which we fed on, having been &s;o long
<PB N="526" REF="552">
in Salt, was but ordinary Food for &s;ickly Men to Feed on.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Heath,</HI> when he &s;aw the mi&s;ery of his Company, ordered his own Tamarinds, of which he had &s;ome Jars aboard, to be given &s;ome to each Me&s;s, to eat with their Rice. This was a great refre&s;hment to the men, and I do believe it contri|buted much to keep us on our Legs.</P>
<P>This Di&s;temper was &s;o univer&s;al, that I do be|lieve there was &s;carce a man in the Ship but lan|gui&s;hed under it; yet it &s;tole &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly on us, that we could not &s;ay we were &s;ick, feeling little or no pain, only a Weakne&s;s, and but little Stomach. Nay, mo&s;t of tho&s;e that died in this Voyage, would hardly be per&s;waded to keep their Cabbins, or Hammocks, till they could not &s;tir about; and when they were forced to lye down, they made their Wills and piked off in two or three days.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the&s;e men, and the weak langui&s;h|ing condition that the re&s;t of us were in, rendered us uncapable to govern our Ship, when the Wind blew more than ordinary. This often happened when we drew near the Cape, and as oft put us to our trumps to manage the Ship. Captain <HI>Health,</HI> to encourage his men to their labour, kept his Watch as con&s;tantly as any man, tho' &s;ickly him&s;elf, and lent an helping hand on all occa&s;ions. But at la&s;t, almo&s;t de&s;pairing of gaining his Pa&s;&s;age to the Cape, by rea&s;on of the Winds coming Southerly, and we having now been &s;ailing 8 or 9 weeks, he called all our men to con&s;ult about our &s;afety, and de&s;ired every man, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, freely to give his real Opinion and Advice, what to do in this dangerous juncture; for we were not in a condition to keep out long; and could we not get to Land quickly, mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed at Sea. He con&s;ulted therefore whether it were be&s;t to beat for the Cape, or bear away
<PB N="527" REF="553">
for <HI>Johanna,</HI> where we might expect relief, that being a place where our outward bound <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia</HI> Ships u&s;ually touch, and who&s;e Natives are very familiar; but other places, e&s;pecially <HI>St Laa|rence,</HI> or <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which was nearer, was un|known to us. We were now &s;o nigh the Cape that with a fair Wind we might expect to be there in 4 or 5 days; but as the Wind was now, we could not hope to get thither. On the other &s;ide this Wind was fair to carry us to <HI>Johanna:</HI> but then <HI>Johanna</HI> was a great way off, and if the Wind &s;hould continue as it was, to bring us into a true Trade Wind, yet we could not get thither under a fortnight; and if we &s;hould meet calms, as we might probably expect, it might be much longer. Be&s;ides, we &s;hould lo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age about the Cape till <HI>October</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> this being about the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> for after the 10th of <HI>May</HI> 'tis not u&s;ual to beat about the Cape to come home. All circum&s;tances therefore being weighed and con&s;idered, we at la&s;t unanimou&s;ly agreed to pro|&s;ecute our Voyage towards the Cape, and with pa|tience wait for a &s;hift of Wind.</P>
<P>But Captain <HI>Heath,</HI> having thus far &s;ounded the inclination of his weak men, told them, that it was not enough that they all con&s;ented to beat for the Cape, for our de&s;ires were not &s;ufficient to bring us thither; but that there would need a more than ordinary labour and management from tho&s;e that were able. And withal, for their en|couragement he promi&s;ed a months pay <HI>Gratis,</HI> to every man that would engage to a&s;&s;i&s;t on all oc|ca&s;ions, and be ready upon call, whether it were his turn to watch or not; and this Money he promi&s;ed to pay at the Cape. This offer was fir&s;t embraced by &s;ome of the Officers, and then as many of the Men as found them&s;elves in a capacity, li&s;ted them&s;elves in a Roll to &s;erve their Commander.</P>
<P><PB N="528" REF="554">
This was wi&s;ely contrived of the Captain, for he could not have compell'd them in their weak condition, neither would fair Words alone, with|out &s;ome hopes of a reward, have engaged them to &s;o much extraordinary Work; for the Ship, Sail and Rigging were much out of repair. For my part, I was too weak to enter my &s;elf into that Li&s;t, for el&s;e our common &s;afety, which I plainly &s;aw lay at &s;take, would have prompted me to do more than any &s;uch reward would do. In a &s;hort time after this it plea&s;ed God to favour us with a fine Wind, which being improved to the be&s;t advan|tage by the ince&s;&s;ant labour of the&s;e new li&s;ted men, brought us in a &s;hort time to the Cape.</P>
<P>The night before we entred the Harbour, which was about the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> being near the Land, we fired a Gun every hour, to give notice that we were in di&s;tre&s;s. The next day, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain came aboard in his Boat, who &s;eeing us &s;o weak as not to be able to trim our Sails to turn into the Harbour; tho we did tolerably well at Sea, before the Wind, and being reque&s;ted by our Captain to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, &s;ent a&s;hore for a hundred lu&s;ty men, who immediately came aboard, and brought our Ship in to an Anchor. They al&s;o un|bent our Sails, and did every thing for us that they were required to do, for which Capt. <HI>Heath</HI> gra|tified them to the full.</P>
<P>The&s;e men had better &s;tomachs than we, and eat freely of &s;uch Food as the Ship afforded: and they having the freedom of our Ship, to go to and fro between Decks, made prize of what they could lay their hands on, e&s;pecially Salt Beef, which our men, for want of &s;tomachs in the Voyage, had hung up 6, 8, or 10 pieces in a place. This was conveyed away before we knew it, or thought of it: be&s;ides, in the night, there was a Bale of Muz|lins broke open, and a great deal conveyed away:
<PB N="529" REF="555">
but whether the Muzlins were &s;tolen by our own men, or the <HI>Dutch,</HI> I cannot &s;ay; for we had &s;ome very dexterous Thieves in our Ship.</P>
<P>Being thus got &s;afe to an Anchor, the Sick were pre&s;ently &s;ent a&s;hore to Quarters provided for them, and tho&s;e that were able remained aboard, and had good fat Mutton, or fre&s;h Beef, &s;ent a|board every day. I went a&s;hore al&s;o with my Painted Prince, where I remained with him till the time of &s;ailing again, which was about &s;ix Weeks. In which time I took the opportunity to inform my &s;elf what I could concerning this Country, which I &s;hall in the next place give you a brief account of, and &s;o make what ha&s;te I can home.</P>
<P>The Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> is the utmo&s;t Bounds of the Continent of <HI>Africa</HI> towards the South, lying in 34 d. 30 m. S. lat. in a very temperate Climate. I look upon this Latitude to be one of the milde&s;t and &s;weete&s;t for its temperature of any what&s;oever; and I cannot here but take notice of a common prejudice our <HI>European</HI> Seamen have as to this Country, that they look upon it as much colder, than Places in the &s;ame Latitude to the North of the Line. I am not of their opinion as to that: and their thinking &s;o, I believe, may ea&s;ily be ac|counted for from hence, that whatever way they come to the Cape, whether going to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> or returning back, they pa&s;s thro a hot Climate; and coming to it thus out of an extremity of heat, 'tis no wonder if it appear the colder to them. Some impute the coldne&s;s of the South Wind here to its blowing off from Sea. On the contrary, I have always ob&s;erved the Sea Winds to be warmer than Land Winds, unle&s;s it be when a bloom, as we call it, or hot bla&s;t blow from thence. Such an one we felt in this very Voyage, as we went from Cape <HI>Verd</HI> I&s;lands, towards the <HI>South Seas;</HI> which I forgot to mention in its proper place, Chap. 4th.
<PB N="530" REF="556">
For one afternoon about the 19th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1683. in the lat. of 37 South we felt a brisk Gale coming from off the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> but &s;o violent hot, that we thought it came from &s;ome burning Moun|tain on the Shore, and was like the heat from the mouth of an Oven. Ju&s;t &s;uch another Gleam I felt one afternoon al&s;o, as I lay at Anchor at the <HI>Groin</HI> in <HI>July.</HI> 1694. it came with a Southerly Wind: both the&s;e were followed by a Thunder &s;hower. The&s;e were the only great Blooms I ever met with in my Travels. But &s;etting the&s;e a&s;ide, which are exceptions, I have made it my general ob&s;ervation, that the Sea-Winds are a great deal warmer than tho&s;e which blow from Land: unle&s;s where the Wind blows from the Poles, which I take to be the true cau&s;e of the coldne&s;s of the South Wind at the Cape, for it is cold at Sea al&s;o. And as for the coldne&s;s of Land-Winds, as the South We&s;t parts of <HI>Europe</HI> are very &s;en&s;ible of it from the Northern and Ea&s;tern Winds; &s;o on the oppo&s;ite Coa&s;t of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they are as much pinched with the North We&s;t Winds, blowing exce&s;&s;ively cold from over the Continent; tho its Lat. be not much greater than this of the Cape.</P>
<P>But to proceed: This large Promontory con&s;i&s;ts of high and very remarkable Land; and off at Sea it affords a very plea&s;ant and agreeable Pro|&s;pect. And without doubt the Pro&s;pect of it was very agreeable to tho&s;e <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;ound out this way by Sea to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies;</HI> when after coa&s;ting along the va&s;t Continent of <HI>Africk,</HI> towards the <HI>South Pole,</HI> they had the comfort of &s;eeing the Land and their Cour&s;e end in this Promontory: Which therefore they called the Cape <HI>de Bon E&s;pe|rance,</HI> or of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> finding that they might now proceed Fa&s;twardly.</P>
<P>There is good &s;ounding off this Cape 50 or 60 Leagues at Sea to the Southward, and therefore
<PB N="531" REF="557">
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen &s;tanding over as they u&s;ually do, from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil,</HI> content them&s;elves with their Soundings, concluding thereby that they are abre&s;t of the Cape, they often pa&s;s by without &s;eeing it, and begin to &s;hape their cour&s;e Northward. They have &s;everal other Signs where|by to know when they are near it, as by the Sea-Fowl they meet at Sea, e&s;pecially the Algatro&s;&s;es, a very large long winged Bird, and the Mango-volucres, a &s;maller Fowl. But the greate&s;t depen|dance of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen now is upon their ob&s;erving the variation of the Compa&s;s, which is very carefully minded when they come near the Cape, by taking the Suns Amplitude mornings and evenings. This they are &s;o exact in, that by the help of the Azimuth Compa&s;s, an In&s;trument more peculiar to the Seamen of our Nation, they know when they are abre&s;t of the Cape, or are either to the Ea&s;t or We&s;t of it: And for that rea&s;on, though they &s;hould be to Southward of all the Soundings or fathomable Ground, they can &s;hape their cour&s;e right, without being obliged to make the Land. But the <HI>Dutch,</HI> on the contrary, having &s;ettled them&s;elves on this Promontory, do always touch here in their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Voyages, both going and coming.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Land at Sea is a high Mountain, &s;teep to the Sea, with a flat even top, which is called the Table Land. On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Cape, a little to the Northward of it, there is a &s;pacious Harbour, with a low flat I&s;land lying off it, which you may leave on either hand, and pa&s;s in or out &s;ecurely at either end. Ships that anchor here, ride near the main Land, leaving the I&s;land at a farther di&s;tance without them. The Land by the Sea again&s;t the Harbour is low; but backt with high Mountains a little way in, to the Southward of it.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="558">
The Soil of this Country is of a brown colour; not deep, yet indifferently productive of Gra&s;s, Herbs and Trees. The Gra&s;s is &s;hort, like that which grows on our <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> Downs. The Trees hereabouts are but &s;mall and few; the Country al&s;o farther from the Sea does not much abound in Trees, as I have been informed. The Mould or Soil al&s;o is much like this near the Har|bour, which though it cannot be &s;aid to be very fat, or rich Land, yet it is very fit for cultivation, and yields good Croops to the indu&s;trious Husband-man, and the Country is pretty well &s;ettled with Farms, <HI>Dutch</HI> Families, and <HI>French</HI> Refugees, for 20 or 30 leagues up the Country; but there are but few Farms near the Harbour.</P>
<P>Here grows plenty of Wheat, Barley, Pea&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here are al&s;o Fruits of many kinds, as Apples, Pears, Quinces, and the large&s;t Pomgranates that I did ever &s;ee.</P>
<P>The chief Fruits are Grapes. The&s;e thrive very well, and the Country is of later Years &s;o well &s;tockt with Vineyards, that they make abun|dance of Wine, of which they have enough and to &s;pare; and do &s;ell great quantities to Ships that rouch here. This Wine is like a <HI>French</HI> High Country White-wine, but of a pale yellowi&s;h co|lour; it is &s;weet, very plea&s;ant and &s;trong.</P>
<P>The tame Animals of this Country are Sheep, Goats, Hogs, Cows, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Sheep are very large and fat, for they thrive very well here: This being a dry Country, and the &s;hort Pa&s;turage very agreeable to the&s;e Creatures, but it is not &s;o proper for great Cattel; neither is the Beef in its kind &s;o &s;weet as the Mutton. Of wild Bea&s;ts, 'tis &s;aid, here are &s;everal &s;orts, but I &s;aw none. However, it is very likely there are &s;ome wild Bea&s;ts, that prey on the Sheep, becau&s;e they are commonly brought into the Hou&s;es in the night, and penn'd up.</P>
<P><PB N="533" REF="559">
There is a very beautiful &s;ort of wild A&s;s in this Country, who&s;e body is curiou&s;ly &s;triped with equal Li&s;ts of white and black; the Stripes coming from the Ridge of his Back, and ending under the Belly, which is white. The&s;e Stripes are two or three Fingers broad, running parallel with each other, and curiou&s;ly intermixt, one white and one black, over from the Shoulder to the Rump. I &s;aw two of the Skins of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, dried and pre&s;erved to be &s;ent to <HI>Holland,</HI> as a Rarity. They &s;eemed big enough to inclo&s;e the Body of a Bea&s;t, as big as a large Colt of a Twelvemonth old.</P>
<P>Here are a great many Ducks, Dunghil Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and O&s;triges are plentifully found in the dry Mountains and Plains. I eat of their Eggs here, and tho&s;e of whom I bought them told me that the&s;e Creatures lay their Eggs in the Sand, or at lea&s;t on dry Ground, and &s;o leave them to be hatch'd by the Sun. The Meat of one of their Eggs will &s;uffice two Men very well. The Inha|bitants do pre&s;erve the Eggs that they find to &s;ell to Strangers. They were pretty &s;carce when I was here, it being the beginning of their Winter; whereas I was told they lay their Eggs about <HI>Chri&s;t|mas,</HI> which is their Summer.</P>
<P>The Sea hereabouts affords plenty of Fi&s;h of di|vers &s;orts; e&s;pecially a &s;mall &s;ort of Fi&s;h, not &s;o big as a Herring; whereof they have &s;uch great plenty, that they Pickle great Quantities yearly, and &s;end them to <HI>Europe.</HI> Seals are al&s;o in great numbers about the Cape; which, as I have &s;till ob&s;erved, is a good &s;ign of the plentifulne&s;s of Fi&s;h, which is their Food.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> have a &s;trong Fort by the Sea &s;ide, again&s;t the Harbour, where the Governour lives. At about 2 or 300 Paces di&s;tance from thence, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Fort, there is a &s;mall <HI>Dutch</HI> Town, in which I told about 50 or 60 Hou&s;es;
<PB N="534" REF="560">
low, but well built, with Stone-walls; there be|ing plenty of Stone, drawn out of a Quarry clo&s;e by.</P>
<P>On the back&s;ide of the Town, as you go to|wards the Mountains, the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Com|pany have a large Hou&s;e, and a &s;tately Garden walled in with a high Stone-wall.</P>
<P>This Garden is full of divers &s;orts of Herbs, Flowers, Roots, and Fruits, with curious &s;pacious Gravel-walks and Arbors; and is watered with a Brook that de&s;cends out of the Mountains: which being cut into many Channels, is conveyed into all parts of the Garden. The Hedges which make the Walks are very thick, and 9 or 10 foot high: They are kept exceeding neat and even by continual pruning. There are lower Hedges within the&s;e again, which &s;erve to &s;eparate the Fruit-trees from each other, but without &s;hading them: and they keep each &s;ort of Fruit by them|&s;elves, as Apples, Pears, abundance of Quinces, Pomgranats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e all pro&s;per very well, and bear good Fruit, e&s;pecially the Pomgranat. The Roots and Garden-Herbs have al&s;o their di|&s;tinct places, hedged in apart by them&s;elves; and all in &s;uch order, that it is exceeding plea&s;ant and beautiful. There are a great number of Negro Slaves brought from other parts of the World; &s;ome of which are continually weeding, pruning, trimming and looking after it. All Strangers are allowed the liberty to walk there; and by the Servants leave, you may be admitted to ta&s;te of the Fruit: but if you think to do it clande&s;tinly, you may be mi&s;taken, as I knew one was when I was in the Garden, who took 5 or 6 Pomgranats, and was e&s;py'd by one of the Slaves, and threat|ned to be carry'd before the Governour: I believe it co&s;t him &s;ome Money to make his peace, for I heard no more of it. Further up from the Sea,
<PB N="535" REF="561">
beyond the Garden, towards the Mountains, there are &s;everal other &s;mall Gardens and Vineyards, belonging to private Men: but the Mountains are &s;o nigh, that the number of them are but &s;mall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> that live in the Town get con&s;idera|bly by the Ships that frequently touch here, chiefly by entertaining Strangers that come a&s;hoar to re|fre&s;h them&s;elves; for you mu&s;t give 3 <HI>s.</HI> or a Dollar a day for your Entertainment; the Bread and Fle&s;h is as cheap here as in <HI>England;</HI> be&s;ides they buy good pennyworths of the Seamen, both outward and homeward bound, which the Farmers up the Country buy of them again at a dear rate; for they have not an opportunity of buying things at the be&s;t hand, but mu&s;t buy of tho&s;e that live at the Harbour: the neare&s;t Settlements, as I was in|formed, being 20 miles off.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great plenty of Corn and Wine, yet the extraordinary high Taxes which the Company lays on Liquor, makes it very dear; and you can buy none but at the Tavern, except it be by &s;tealth. There are but 3 Hou&s;es in the Town that &s;ell &s;trong Liquor, one of which is this Wine-Hou&s;e or Tavern; there they &s;ell only Wine; another &s;ells Beer and Mum; and the third &s;ells Brandy and Tobacco, all extraordinary dear. A Flask of Wine which holds 3 quarts will co&s;t 18 Sti|vers, for &s;o much I paid for it; yet I bought as much for 8 Stivers in another place, but it was privately, at an unlicenced Hou&s;e, and the per&s;on that &s;old it, would have been ruined had it been known; and thus much for the Country, and the <HI>European</HI> Inhabitants.</P>

as if every one of them had this for his Name. The Word probably hath &s;ome &s;ignification or other in their Language, whatever it is.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Hottantots</HI> are People of a middle Stature, with &s;mall Limbs and thin Bodies, full of activity. Their Faces are of a flat oval Figure, of the <HI>Negro</HI> make, with great Eye-brows, black Eyes, but neither are their No&s;es &s;o flat, nor their Lips &s;o thick, as the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Guinea.</HI> Their Complexion is darker than the common <HI>Indians;</HI> tho' not &s;o black as the <HI>Negroes</HI> or <HI>New Hollanders;</HI> neither is their Hair &s;o much frizled.</P>
<P>They be&s;mear them&s;elves all over with Grea&s;e, as well to keep their Joints &s;upple, as to fence their half naked Bodies from the Air, by &s;topping up their Pores. To do this the more effectually they rub Soot over the grea&s;ed parts, e&s;pecially their Faces, which adds to their natural Beauty, as Painting does in <HI>Europe;</HI> but withal &s;ends from them a &s;trong Smell, which though &s;ufficiently plea&s;ing to them&s;elves, is very unplea&s;ant to others. They are glad of the wor&s;t of Kitchin-&s;tuff for this purpo&s;e, and u&s;e it as often as they can get it.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom of anointing the Body is very common in other parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> e&s;pecially on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where they generally u&s;e Palm-Oil, anointing them&s;elves from Head to Foot; but when they want Oil, they make u&s;e of Kitchin-&s;tuff, which they buy of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that Trade with them. In the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> al&s;o, e&s;pecially on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cudda</HI> and <HI>Malacca,</HI> and in general, on almo&s;t all the Ea&s;terly I&s;lands, as well on <HI>Sumatra, Java, &amp;c.</HI> as on the <HI>Philippine</HI> and Spice I&s;lands, the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants anoint them&s;elves with Coco-nut Oil, two or three times a day, e&s;pecially Mornings and Evenings. They &s;pend &s;ometimes half an hour in cha&s;ing
<PB N="538" REF="564">
the Oil, and rubbing it into their Hair and Skin, leaving no place un&s;mear'd with Oil, but their Face, which they daub not like the&s;e <HI>Hottantots.</HI> The <HI>Americans</HI> al&s;o in &s;ome places do u&s;e this Cu|&s;tom, but not &s;o frequently perhaps for want of Oil and Grea&s;e to do it. Yet &s;ome <HI>AmericanIndians</HI> in the North Seas frequently daub them&s;elves with a Pigment made with Leaves, Roots, or Herbs, or with a &s;ort of red Earth, giving their skins a yel|low, red, or green colour, according as the Pig|ment is. And the&s;e &s;mell un&s;avourly enough to People not accu&s;tomed to them; tho not &s;o rank as tho&s;e who u&s;e Oil or Grea&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hottantots</HI> do wear no covering on their Heads, but deck their Hair with &s;mall &s;hells. Their Garments are Sheep-skins wrapt about their Shoulders like a Mantle, with the Woolly &s;ides next their Bodies. The Men have be&s;ides this Mantle, a piece of Skin like a &s;mall Apron, hanging before them. The Women have another Skin tucked about their Wa&s;tes, which comes down to their Knees like a Petticoat; and their Legs are wrapt round with Sheeps-guts two or three Inches thick, &s;ome up as high as to their Calves, others even from their Feet to their Knees, which at a &s;mall di&s;tance &s;eems to be a &s;ort of Boots. The&s;e are put on when they are green; and &s;o they grow hard and &s;tiff on their Legs for they never pull them off again, till they have occa&s;ion to eat them; which is when they journey from home, and have no other Food, then the&s;e Guts which have been worn, it may be, &s;ix, eight, ten or twelve months, make them a good Banquet: This I was informed of by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They never pull off their Sheep skin Garment, but to lou&s;e them&s;elves, for by continual wearing them they are &s;ull of Vermin, which obliges them often to &s;trip and &s;it in
<PB N="539" REF="565">
the Sun two or three hours together in the heat of the day, to de&s;troy them. Indeed mo&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> that live remote from the Equator, are mole&s;ted with Lice, though their Garments afford le&s;s &s;hel|ter for Lice than the&s;e <HI>Hottatots</HI> Sheep-skins do. For all tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> who live in cold Countries, as in the North and South parts of <HI>America,</HI> have &s;ome &s;ort of Skin or other to cover their Bodies, as Deer, Otter, Beaver or Seals Skins, all which they as con&s;tantly wear, without &s;hifting them|&s;elves, as the&s;e <HI>Hottantots</HI> do their Sheep skins. And hence they are lou&s;y too, and &s;trong &s;cented, though they do not daub them&s;elves at all, or but very little; for even by rea&s;on of their Skins they &s;mell &s;trong.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hottantots</HI> Hou&s;es are the meane&s;t that I did ever &s;ee. They are about 9 or 10 foot high, and 10 or 12 from &s;ide to &s;ide. They are in a manner round made with &s;mall Poles &s;tuck into the ground, and brought together at the top, where they are fa&s;tened. The &s;ides and top of the Hou&s;e are filled up with Boughs cour&s;ely wattled between the Poles, and all is covered over with long Gra&s;s, Ru&s;hes, and pieces of Hides; and the Hou&s;e at a di&s;tance appears ju&s;t like a Hay-cock. They leave only a &s;mall hole on one &s;ide, about 3 or 4 foot high, for a door to creep in and out at; but when the Wind comes in at this door, they &s;top it up, and make another hole in the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. They make the Fire in the middle of the Hou&s;e, and the Smoak a&s;cends out of the Crannies from all parts of the Hou&s;e. They have no Beds to lye on, but tumble down at night round the &s;ire.</P>
<P>Their Hou&s;hold Furniture is commonly an earth|en Pot or two to boil Victuals, and they live very mi&s;erably and hard; 'tis reported that they will la&s;t two or three days together, when they travel about the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="540" REF="566">
Their common Food is either Herbs, Fle&s;h, or Shell-fi&s;h; which they get among the Rocks, or other places at low Water: for they have no Boats, Barklogs, nor Canoas to go a Fi&s;hing in; &s;o that their chiefe&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is on Land Animals, or on &s;uch Herbs as the Land na|turally produceth. I was told by my <HI>Dutch</HI> Land|lord, that they kept Sheep and Bullocks here be|fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ettled among them: and that the Inland <HI>Hottantots</HI> have &s;till great &s;tocks of Cattle, and &s;ell them to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for Rolls of Tobacco: and that the price for which they &s;ell a Cow or Sheep, was as much twi&s;ted Tobacco, as will reach from the Horns or Head to the Tayl; for they are great lovers of Tobacco, and will do any thing for it. This their way of trucking was confirmed to me by many others, who yet &s;aid that they could not buy their Beef this cheap way, for they had not the liberty to deal with the <HI>Hot|tantots,</HI> that being a priviledge which the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Company re&s;erve to them&s;elves. My Landlord having a great many Lodgers, fed us mo&s;t with Mutton, &s;ome of which he bought of the Butcher, and there is but one in the Town; but mo&s;t of it he killed in the Night. the Sheep being brought privately by the <HI>Hottantots,</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the Skinning and Dre&s;&s;ing, and had the Skin and Guts for their pains: I judged the&s;e Sheep were fetched out of the country, a good way off, for he him&s;elf would be ab&s;ent a day or two to procure them, and two or three <HI>Hottantots</HI> with him. The&s;e of the <HI>Hottantots</HI> that live by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Town, have their greate&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for there is one or more of them be|longing to every Hou&s;e. The&s;e do all &s;orts of &s;ervile work, and there take their Food and Grea&s;e. Three or four more of their neare&s;t Relations &s;it at the Doors or near the <HI>Dutch</HI> Hou&s;e, waiting
<PB N="541" REF="567">
for the &s;craps and fragments that come from the Table; and if between meals the <HI>Dutch</HI> people have any occa&s;ion for them, to go on Errands, or the like, they are ready at command; expecting little for their pains; but for a Stranger they will not budge under a Stiver.</P>
<P>Their Religion, if they have any, is wholly unknown to me; for they have no Temple nor Idol, nor any place of Wor&s;hip that I did &s;ee or hear of. yet their mirth and nocturnal pa&s;times at the New and Full of the Moon, lookt as if they had &s;ome Super&s;tition about it. For at the Full e&s;pecially they &s;ing and dance all Night, making a great noi&s;e: I walked out to their Huts twice at the&s;e times, in the Evening, when the Moon aro&s;e above the Horizon, and viewed them for an hour or more. They &s;eem all very bu&s;ie, both Men, Women and Children, dancing very oddly on the green Gra&s;s by their Hou&s;es. They traced two and fro promi&s;cuou&s;ly, often clapping their hands and &s;inging aloud. Their Faces were &s;ometimes to the Ea&s;t, &s;ometimes to the We&s;t: neither did I &s;ee any motion or ge&s;ture that they u&s;ed when their Faces were toward the Moon, more than when their backs were toward it. Af|ter I had thus ob&s;erved them for a while, I return|ed to my Lodging, which was not above 2 or 300 paces from their Huts; and I heard them &s;inging in the &s;ame manner all Night. In the grey of the Morning I walk'd out again, and found many of the Men and Women &s;till Singing and Dancing; who continued their Mirth till the Moon went down, and then they left off: Some of them going into their Huts to &s;leep, and others to their attendance in their <HI>Dutch</HI> Hou&s;es. Other Negroes are le&s;s circum&s;pect in their Night-Dances, as to the preci&s;e time of the Full Moon, they being more general in the&s;e Nocturnal Pa|&s;times,
<PB N="542" REF="568">
and u&s;e them oftner; as do many people al&s;o in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies:</HI> yet there is a dif|ference between colder and warmer Countries as to their Deverti&s;ements. The warmer Climates being generally very productive of delicate Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the&s;e unciviliz'd people caring for little el&s;e than what is barely nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;pend the greate&s;t part of their time in diverting them&s;elves, after their &s;everal fa&s;hions; but the <HI>Indians</HI> of colder Climates are not &s;o much at lei&s;ure, the Fruits of the Earth being &s;carce with them, and they nece&s;&s;iated to be continually Fi&s;hing, Hunting, or Fowling for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; not as with us for Recreation.</P>
<P>As for the&s;e <HI>Hottantots,</HI> they are a very lazy &s;ort of People, and tho they live in a delicate Country, very fit to be manured, and where there is Land enough for them, yet they choo&s;e rather to live as their Fore-fathers, poor and mi&s;erable, than be at pains for plenty. And &s;o much for the <HI>Hottantots:</HI> I &s;hall now return to our own af|fairs.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival at the Cape, Captain <HI>Heath</HI> took an Hou&s;e to live in, in order to recover his Health. Such of his men as were able did &s;o too, for the re&s;t he provided Lodgings and paid their Expences. Three or four of our men, who came a&s;hore very &s;ick, died, but the re&s;t, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Doctors of the Fort, a fine Air, and good Kitchin and Cellar Phy&s;ick, &s;oon recovered their Healths. Tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;cribed to be at all calls, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to bring in the Ship, received Cap|tain <HI>Heath</HI>'s Bounty, by which they furni&s;hed them&s;elves, with Liquor for their homeward Voyage. But we were now &s;o few, that we could not &s;ail the Ship; therefore Captain <HI>Heath</HI> de&s;ired the Governour to &s;pare him &s;ome Men; and as I was informed, had a promi&s;e to be
<PB N="543" REF="569">
&s;upplied out of the homeward bound <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships, that were now expected every day, and we waiied for them. In the mean time in came the <HI>James and Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Jo&s;iah of London,</HI> bound home. Out of tho&s;e we thought to have been furni&s;hed with men; but they had only e|nough for them&s;elves; therefore we waited yet longer for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, which at la&s;t arrived but we could get no men from them.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Heath</HI> was therefore forced to get Men by &s;tealth, &s;uch as he could pick up, whether Sol|diers or Seamen. The <HI>Dutch</HI> knew our want of Men, therefore near 40 of them, tho&s;e that had a de&s;ign to return to <HI>Europe,</HI> came privately and offered them&s;elves, and waited in the night at places appointed, where our Boats went and fetched 3 or 4 aboard at a time, and hid them, e&s;pecially when any <HI>Dutch</HI> Boat came aboard our Ship. Here at the Cape I met my Friend <HI>Daniel Wallis,</HI> the &s;ame who leapt into the Sea and &s;wam at <HI>Pulo Con|dore.</HI> After &s;everal Traver&s;es to <HI>Madaga&s;car, Don Ma&s;carin, Ponticherri, Pegu, Cunnimere, Maderas,</HI> and the River of <HI>Hugli,</HI> he was now got hither in a homeward bound <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship. I &s;oon per&s;uaded him to come over to us, and found means to get him aboard our Ship.</P>
<P>About the 23d of <HI>May</HI> we &s;ailed from the Cape, in the Company of the <HI>James and Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Ja&s;iah,</HI> directing our cour&s;e towards the I&s;land <HI>Santa Hellena.</HI> We met nothing of remark in this Voyage, except a great &s;welling Sea, out of the S. W. which taking us on the broad &s;ide, made us roll &s;ufficiently. Such of our Water-casks as were between Decks, running from &s;ide to &s;ide, were in a &s;hort time all &s;taved, and the Deck well wa&s;hed with the fre&s;h Water. The Shot tumbled out the Lockers and Garlands; and rung a loud Peal, rumbling from &s;ide to &s;ide, every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">wl that
<PB N="544" REF="570">
the Ship made; neither was it an ea&s;ie matter to reduce them again within bounds. The Guns be|ing carefully look'd after and la&s;h'd fa&s;t, never budg'd, but the Tackles or Pulleys, and La&s;hings, made great Mu&s;ick too. The &s;udden and violent motion of the Ship, made us fearful la&s;t &s;ome of the Guns &s;hould have broken loo&s;e, which mu&s;t have been very detrimental to the Ship's &s;ides. The Ma&s;ts were al&s;o in great danger to be rowl'd by the board; but no harm happen'd to any of us, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of 3 or 4 Butts of Water, and a Barrel or two of good Cape Wine, which was &s;tav'd in the great Cabbin.</P>
<P>This great tumbling Sea took us &s;hortly after we came from the Cape. The violence of it la&s;ted but one night; yet we had a continual &s;wel|ling came out of the S. W. almo&s;t during all the pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Santa Hellena;</HI> which was an eminent token that the S. W. Winds were now violent in the higher Latitudes towards the South Pole; for this was the time of the Year for tho&s;e Winds. Notwith&s;tanding this boi&s;terous Sea coming thus obliquely upon us, we had fine clear Weather, and a moderate Gale at S. E. or between that and the Ea&s;t, till we came to the I&s;land <HI>Santa Hellena,</HI> where we arrived the 20th day of <HI>June.</HI> There we found the <HI>Prince&s;s Ann</HI> at an Anchor, waiting for us.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Santa Hellena</HI> lies in about 16 De|grees South Lat. The Air is commonly &s;erene and clear, except in the Months that yield Rain; yet we had one or two very rainy days, even while we were here. Here are moi&s;t Sea&s;ons to Plant and Sow, and the Weather is temperate enough as to Heat, tho &s;o near the Equator, and very heal|thy.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is but &s;mall, not above nine or ten Leagues in length, and &s;tands 3 or 400 Leagues
<PB N="545" REF="571">
from the main Land. It is bounded again&s;t the Sea with &s;teep Rocks, &s;o that there is no landing but at two or three places. The Land is high and Mountainous, and &s;eems to be very dry and poor; yet they are fine Valleys, proper for cultivation. The Mountains appear bare, only in &s;ome places you may &s;ee a few low Shrubs, but the Valleys afford &s;ome Trees fit for building, as I was in|formed.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t di&s;covered and &s;ettled by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who &s;tockt it with Goats and Hogs. But it being afterwards de|&s;erted by them, it lay wa&s;te, till the <HI>Dutch,</HI> find|ing it convenient to relieve their <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships, &s;ettled it again; but they afterwards relinqui&s;hed it for a more convenient place; I mean the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> Then the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India</HI> Com|pany &s;ettled their Servants there, and began to for|tify it, but they being yet weak, the <HI>Dutch</HI> about the year 1672, came thither, and re-took it, and keep it in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This News being re|ported in <HI>England,</HI> Captain <HI>Monday</HI> was &s;ent to re-take it, who by the advice and conduct of one that had formerly lived there, landed a party of Armed Men in the night in a &s;mall Cove, un|known to the <HI>Dutch</HI> then in Garri&s;on, and climb|ing the Rocks, got up into the I&s;land, and &s;o came in the morning to the Hills hanging over the Fort, which &s;tands by the Sea in a &s;mall Val|ley. From thence firing into the Fort, they &s;oon made them &s;urrender. There were at this time two or three <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships, either at An|chor or coming thither, when our Ships were there. The&s;e, when they &s;aw that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were Ma&s;ters of the I&s;land again, made &s;ail to be gone; but being chaced by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigots, 2 of them became rich Prizes to Capt. <HI>Monday</HI> and his men.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="572">
The I&s;land hath continued ever &s;ince in the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, and hath been greatly &s;trengthned both with Men and Guns; &s;o that at this day it is &s;ecure enough from the Inva&s;ion of an Enemy. For the common Landing place is a &s;mall Bay, like a Half Moon, &s;carce 500 paces wide, between the two Points. Clo&s;e by the Sea-&s;ide are good Guns planted at equal di&s;tances, lying along from one end of the Bay to the other; be&s;ides a &s;mall Fort, a little fur|ther in from the Sea, near the mid&s;t of the Bay. All which makes the Bay &s;o &s;trong, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to force it. The &s;mall Cove where Capt. <HI>Monday</HI> landed his Men when he took the I&s;land from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> is &s;carce fit for a Boat to land at; and yet that is now al&s;o fortified.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town within the great Bay, &s;tanding in a little Valley, between two high &s;teep Mountains. There may be about 20 or 30 &s;mall Hou&s;es, who&s;e Walls are built with rough Stones: The in&s;ide Furniture is very mean. The Governour has a pretty tolerable hand&s;ome low Hou&s;e, by the Fort; where he commonly lives, having a few Soldiers to attend him, and to guard the Fort. But the Hou&s;es in the Town before, mentioned &s;tand empty, &s;ave only when Ships arrive here here; for their Owners have all Plantations farther in the I&s;land, where they con|&s;tantly employ them&s;elves. But when Ships ar|rive, they all flock to the Town, where they live all the time that the Ships lie here; for then is their Fair or Market, to buy &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as they want, and to &s;ell off the Produce of their Plan|tations.</P>
<P>Their Plantations afford Potatoes, Yams and &s;ome Plantains and Bonanoes. Their Stock con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly of Hogs, Bullocks, Cocks and Hens, Ducks, Gee&s;e and Turkeys, of which they have
<PB N="547" REF="573">
great plenty, and fell them at a low rate to the Sailers, taking in exchange, Shirts, Drawers, or any light Cloaths; pieces of Callico, Silks, or Muzlins: Arack, Sugar and Lime juice, is al&s;o much e&s;teemed and coveted by them. But now they are in hopes to produce Wine and Brandy in a &s;hort time; for they do already begin to plant Vines for that end, there being a few <HI>French</HI> men that are to manage that affair. This I was told but I &s;aw nothing of it, for it rained &s;o hard when I was a&s;hoar, that I had not the opportunity of &s;eeing their Plantations. I was al&s;o informed, that they get Manatee or Sea-Cows here, which &s;eemed very &s;trange to me. Therefore enquiring more &s;trictly into the matter, I found the <HI>Santa Hellena</HI> Manatee to be, by their &s;hapes, and manner of lying a&s;hoar on the Rocks, tho&s;e Crea|tures called Sea-Lyons; for the Manatee never come a&s;hoar, neither are they feund near any rocky &s;hores, as this I&s;land is, there being no feed|ing for them in &s;uch places. Be&s;ides, in this I&s;land there is no River for them to drink at, tho there is a &s;mall Brook runs into the Sea, out of the Valley by the Fort.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here 5 or 6 days; all which time the I&s;landers lived at the Town, to entertain the Seamen; who con&s;tantly flock a&s;hore, to enjoy them&s;elves among their Country people. Our touching at the Cape had greatly drained the Seamen of their loo&s;e Corns, at which the&s;e I&s;landers as greatly repined; and &s;ome of the poorer &s;ort openly complained again&s;t &s;uch doings, &s;aying, it was fit that the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company &s;hould be acquainted with it, that they might hinder their Ships from touching at the Cape. Yet they were extreamly kind, in hopes to get what was remaining. They are mo&s;t of them very poor: but &s;uch as could get a little Liquor to &s;ell
<PB N="548" REF="574">
to the Seamen at this time got what the Seamen could &s;pare, for the Punch-hou&s;es were never empty. But had we all come directly hither, and not touched at the Cape, even the poore&s;t people among them would have gotten &s;omething by entertaining &s;ick men. For commonly the Seamen coming home, are troubled, more or le&s;s with Scorbutick Di&s;tempers; and their only hopes are to get refre&s;hment and health at this I&s;land, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e hopes &s;eldom or never fail them, if once they get footing here. For the I&s;lands afford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">bundance of delicate Herbs, wherewith the &s;ick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">re fir&s;t bathed to &s;upple their Joints, and then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ruits and Herbs, and fre&s;h food &s;oon after cure them of their Scorbutick Humour. So that in a weeks time men that have been carried a&s;hore in Hammocks, and they who were wholly unable to go, have &s;oon been able to leap and dance. Doubtle&s;s the &s;erenity and whole&s;omne&s;s of the Air contri|butes much to the carrying off of the&s;e Di&s;tem|pers; for here is con&s;tantly a fre&s;h breze. While we &s;tayed here, many of the Seamen got Sweet-hearts. One young man belonging to the <HI>James and Mary,</HI> was married, and brought his Wife to <HI>England</HI> with him. Another brought his Sweet-heart to <HI>England,</HI> they being each engaged by Bonds to marry at their arrival in <HI>England;</HI> and &s;everal other of our men were over Head and Ears in love with the <HI>Santa Hellena</HI> Maids, who tho they were born there, yet very earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to be relea&s;ed from that Pri&s;on, which they have no other way to compa&s;s, but by marrying Seamen or Pa&s;&s;engers that touch here. The young Women born here, are but one remove from <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being the Daughters of &s;uch. They are well &s;haped, proper and comely, were they in a dre&s;s to &s;et them off.</P>

My &s;tay a&s;hore here was but two days, to get refre&s;hments for my &s;elf and <HI>Jcoly,</HI> whom I car|ryed a&s;hore with me: and he was very diligent to pick up &s;uch things as the I&s;lands afforded, carry|ing a&s;hore with him a Bag, which the People of the I&s;le filled with Roots for him. They flockt about him, and &s;eemed to admire him much. This was the la&s;t place where I had him at my own di&s;po&s;al, for the Mate of the Ship, who had Mr. <HI>Moodie</HI>'s &s;hare in him, left him entirely to my ma|nagement, I being to bring him to <HI>England.</HI> But I was no &s;ooner arrived in the <HI>Thames,</HI> but he was &s;ent a&s;hore to be &s;een by &s;ome eminent per&s;ons; and I being in want of Money, was prevailed upon to &s;ell fir&s;t part of my &s;hare in him, and by degrees all of it. After this I heard he was carry|ed about to be &s;hown as a Sight, and that he died of the &s;mall Pox at <HI>Ox&s;ord.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed, our Water being filled, and the Ship all &s;tockt with fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, we &s;ailed from hence in Company of the <HI>Prince&s;s Ann,</HI> the <HI>James and Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Jo&s;iah, July</HI> the 2d, 1691. directing our cour&s;e towards <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;ign|ing to touch no where by the way. We were now in the way of the Trade Winds, which we commonly find at E. S. E. or S. E. by E. or <HI>S.</HI> E. till we draw near the Line, and &s;ometimes till we are 8 or 10 degrees to the North of the Line. For which rea&s;on Ships might &s;hape their cour&s;e &s;o as to keep on the <HI>A&s;rican</HI> &s;hore, and pa&s;s between Cape <HI>Verd</HI> and Cape <HI>Verd</HI> I&s;lands; for that &s;eems to be the dircte&s;t cour&s;e to <HI>England.</HI> But expe|rience often &s;hews us, that the &s;arthe&s;t way about is the neare&s;t way home, and &s;o it is here. For by &s;triving to keep near the <HI>A&s;rican</HI> &s;hore, you meet with the Winds more uncertain, and &s;ubject to calms; whereas in keeping the mid way be|tween <HI>A&s;rica</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> or rather nearer the
<PB N="550" REF="576">
<HI>American</HI> Continent, till you are North of the Line, you have a brisk con&s;tant gale.</P>
<P>This was the way that we took, and in our pa&s;|&s;age before we got to the Line, we &s;aw three Ships, and making towards them, we found two of them to be <HI>Portugueze,</HI> bound to <HI>Brazil.</HI> The third kept on a Wind, &s;o that we could not &s;peak with her; but we found by the <HI>Portugueze</HI> it was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship called the <HI>Dorothy,</HI> Capt. <HI>Thwart</HI> Commander, bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> After this, we kept Company &s;till with our 3 Con&s;orts till we came near <HI>England,</HI> and then were &s;eparated by bad weather; but before we came within &s;ight of Land we got together again, all but the <HI>James and Mary.</HI> She got into the Channel be|fore us, and went to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and there gave an account of the re&s;t of us; whereupon our Men of War who l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y there, came out to joyn us, and meeting us, brought us off of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> There our Con&s;ort the <HI>James and Mary</HI> came to us again, and from thence we all &s;ailed in company of &s;eve|ral Men of War towards <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> There our fir&s;t Convoy left us, and went in thither. But we did not want Convoys, for our Fleets were then re|pairing to their Winter Harbours, to be laid up; &s;o that we had the company of &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and a Squadron al&s;o of <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ailed up the Channel, but kept off farther from our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, they being bound home to <HI>Holland.</HI> When we came as high as the <HI>South Foreland,</HI> we left them &s;tanding on their cour&s;e, keeping on the back of the <HI>Goodwin Sands;</HI> and we lufft in for the <HI>Downs,</HI> where we anchored <HI>September</HI> the 16th, 1691.</P>
