<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Ruminating Animals.</HEAD>
<P>OF all animals, tho&s;e that chew the cud are the mo&s;t harmle&s;s,
and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily tamed. As they live entirely upon vegetables, it is
neither their intere&s;t nor their plea&s;ure to make war upon the re&s;t of
the brute creation; content with the pa&s;tures where they are placed, they
&s;eldom de&s;ire to change, while they are furni&s;hed with a proper &s;upply;
and fearing nothing from each other, they generally go in herds for their
mutual &s;ecurity. All the fierce&s;t of the carnivorous kinds &s;eek their
food <PB N="2" REF="5"> in gloomy &s;olitude; the&s;e, on the contrary, range
together; the very meane&s;t of them are found to unite in each other's
defence; and the hare it&s;elf is a gregarious animal, in tho&s;e countries
where it has no other enemies but the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t to guard
again&s;t.</P>
<P>As the food of ruminant animals is entirely of the vegetable kind,
and as this is very ea&s;ily procured, &s;o the&s;e animals &s;eem naturally
more indolent and le&s;s artful than tho&s;e of the carnivo|rous kinds; and as
their appetites are more &s;imple, their in&s;tincts &s;eem to be le&s;s
capable of variation. The fox or the wolf are for ever prowling; their long
habits of want give them a degree of &s;harpne&s;s and cunning; their life is a
con|tinued &s;cene of &s;tratagem and e&s;cape: but the patient ox, or the
deer, enjoy the repa&s;t that Nature has abundantly provided; certain of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and content with &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>As Nature has furni&s;hed the&s;e animals with an appetite for
&s;uch coar&s;e and &s;imple nutri|ment, &s;o &s;he has enlarged the capacity
of the inte&s;tines, to take in a greater &s;upply. In the carnivorous kinds,
as their food is nouri&s;hing and juicy, their &s;tomachs are but &s;mall, and
their inte&s;tines &s;hort; but in the&s;e, who&s;e pa&s;ture is coar&s;e, and
where much mu&s;t be ac|cumulated before any quantity of nouri&s;hment 
<PB N="3" REF="6"> can be obtained, their &s;tomachs are large and numerous,
and their inte&s;tines long and mu&s;|cular. The bowels of a ruminating animal
may be con&s;idered as an elaboratory, with ve&s;&s;els in it, fitted for
various tran&s;mutations. It requires a long and tedious proce&s;s before
gra&s;s can be tran&s;muted into fle&s;h; and for this purpo&s;e, Nature, in
general, has furni&s;hed &s;uch animals as feed upon gra&s;s, with four
&s;tomachs, through which the food &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;&s;es, and undergoes
the proper &s;eparations.</P>
<P>Of the four &s;tomachs with which ruminant animals are furni&s;hed,
the fir&s;t is called the paunch, which receives the food after it has been
&s;lightly chewed; the &s;econd is called the honeycomb, and is properly
nothing more than a continuation of the former; the&s;e two, which are very
capacious, the animal fills as fa&s;t as it can, and then lies down to
ruminate, which may be properly con&s;idered as a kind of vo|miting without
effort or pain. The two &s;to|machs abovementioned being filled with as much as
they can contain, and the gra&s;s, which was &s;lightly chewed, beginning to
&s;well with the heat of the &s;ituation, it dilates the &s;tomachs, and
the&s;e again contract upon their contents. The aliment, thus &s;queezed, has
but two pa&s;|&s;ages to e&s;cape at; one into the third &s;tomach, 
<PB N="4" REF="7"> which is very narrow; and the other back, by the gullet,
into the mouth, which is wider. The greate&s;t quantity, therefore, is driven
back through the large&s;t aperture into the mouth, to be chewed a &s;econd
time; while a &s;mall part, and that only the mo&s;t liquid, is driven into the
third &s;tomach, through the orifice which is &s;o &s;mall. The food which is
driven to the mouth, and chewed a &s;econd time, is thus ren|dered more &s;oft
and moi&s;t, and becomes at la&s;t liquid enough to pa&s;s into the conduit
that goes to the third &s;tomach, where it undergoes a &s;till farther
comminution. In this &s;tomach, which is called the manyfold, from the number
of its leaves, all which tend to promote dige&s;tion, the gra&s;s has the
appearance of boiled &s;pinage, but not yet &s;ufficiently reduced, &s;o as to
make a part of the animal's nouri&s;hment: it re|quires the operation of the
fourth &s;tomach for this purpo&s;e, where it undergoes a complete maceration,
and is &s;eparated to be turned into chyle.</P>
<P>But Nature has not been le&s;s careful in another re&s;pect, in
fitting the inte&s;tines of the&s;e animals for their food. In the carnivorous
kinds they are thin and lean; but in ruminating animals they are &s;trong,
fle&s;hy, and well covered with fat. Every precaution &s;eems taken that 
<PB N="5" REF="8"> can help their dige&s;tion: their &s;tomach is &s;trong and
mu&s;cular, the more readily to act upon its contents; their inte&s;tines are
lined with fat, the better to pre&s;erve their warmth; and they are extended to
a much greater length, &s;o as to extract every part of that nouri&s;hment
which their vegetable food &s;o &s;cantily &s;upplies.</P>
<P>In this manner are all quadrupedes of the cow, the &s;heep, or the
deer kind, &s;een to ru|minate; being thus furni&s;hed with four &s;to|machs,
for the macerating of their food. The&s;e, therefore, may mo&s;t properly be
called the ru|minant kinds; although there are many others that have this
quality in a le&s;s ob&s;ervable de|gree. The rhinoceros, the camel, the
hor&s;e, the rabbit, the marmotte, and the &s;quirrel, all chew the cud by
intervals, although they are not furni&s;hed with &s;tomachs like the former.
But not the&s;e alone, there are numberle&s;s other ani|mals that appear to
ruminate; not only birds, but fi&s;hes, and in&s;ects. Among birds are the
pelican, the &s;tork, the heron, the pidgeon, and the turtle; the&s;e have a
power of di&s;gorging their food to feed their young. Among fi&s;hes are
lob&s;ters, crabs, and that fi&s;h called the do|rado. The &s;almon al&s;o is
&s;aid to be of this number: and, if we may believe Ovid, the <PB N="6" REF="9"> &s;carus likewi&s;e; of which he &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q> 
<L>At contra herbo&s;a pi&s;ces laxantur arena,</L> 
<L>Ut &s;carus epa&s;tas &s;olus qui ruminat
e&s;cas.</L></Q></NOTE>: 
<Q> 
<L>Of all the fi&s;h that graze beneath the flood,</L> 
<L>He only ruminates his former food.</L></Q> Of in&s;ects, the
ruminating tribe is &s;till larger: the mole, the cricket, the wa&s;p, the
drone, the bee, the gra&s;hopper, and the beetle. All the&s;e animals either
actually chew the cud, or &s;eem at lea&s;t to ruminate. They have the
&s;tomach compo&s;ed of mu&s;cular fibres, by means whereof the food is ground
up and down, in the &s;ame manner as in tho&s;e which are particularly
di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of ruminants.</P>
<P>But not the&s;e alone; men them&s;elves have been often known to
ruminate, and &s;ome even with plea&s;ure. The accounts of the&s;e calamities,
for &s;uch I mu&s;t con&s;ider them, in|cident to our fellow-creatures, are not
very plea|&s;ant to read; yet I mu&s;t tran&s;cribe a &s;hort one, as given us
by Slare, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, as it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure
&s;hew the &s;atisfaction which the lower tribes of ani|mals enjoy while they
ruminate. The man in que&s;tion was a citizen of Bri&s;tol, of about twenty
years of age, and, what &s;eemed more extraordinary &s;till, of a ruminating
family, for <PB N="7" REF="10"> his father was frequently &s;ubject to the
&s;ame infirmity, or amu&s;ement, as he him&s;elf perhaps would call it. This
young man u&s;ually began to chew his meat over again within about a quarter of
an hour after eating. His ruminating after a full meal generally la&s;ted about
an hour and an half; nor could he &s;leep until this ta&s;k was performed. The
victuals, upon the re|turn, ta&s;ted even more plea&s;antly than at fir&s;t;
and returned as if they had been beaten up in a mortar. If he ate a variety of
things, that which he ate fir&s;t came up again fir&s;t; and if this return was
interrupted for any time, it pro|duced &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;order, and he was
never well till it returned. In&s;tances of this kind, however, are rare and
accidental; and it is happy for mankind that they are &s;o. Of all other
animals, we &s;pend the lea&s;t time in eating; this is one of the great
di&s;tinctions between us and the brute creation; and eating is a plea&s;ure of
&s;o low a kind, that none but &s;uch as are nearly allied to the quadrupede,
de&s;ire its prolon|gation.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="11">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Quadrupedes of the Cow Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF all ruminant animals, tho&s;e of the cow kind de&s;erve the
fir&s;t rank, both for their &s;ize, their beauty, and their &s;ervices. The
hor&s;e is more properly an animal belonging to the rich; the &s;heep chiefly
thrives in a flock, and requires attendance; but the cow is more e&s;pecially
the poor man's pride, his riches, and his &s;upport. There are many of our
pea&s;antry that have no other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion but a cow; and even of the
ad|vantages re&s;ulting from this mo&s;t u&s;eful crea|ture, the poor are but
the nominal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Its fle&s;h they cannot pretend to ta&s;te,
&s;ince then their whole riches are at once de&s;troyed; its calf they are
obliged to fatten for &s;ale, &s;ince veal is a delicacy they could not make
any preten&s;ions to; its very milk is wrought into butter and chee&s;e for the
tables of their ma&s;ters; while they have no &s;hare even in their own
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but the choice of their market. I cannot bear to hear the
rich crying out for li|berty, while they thus &s;tarve their fellow crea|tures,
and feed them up with an imaginary good, while they monopolize the real
benefits of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">In tho&s;e countries where the men are under
better &s;ubordination, this excellent animal is of more general advantage. In
Germany, Poland, and Switzerland, every pea&s;ant keeps two or three cows, not
for the benefit of his ma&s;ter, but for him&s;elf. The meane&s;t of the
pea&s;ants there kills one cow at lea&s;t for his own table, which he &s;alts
and hangs up, and thus pre&s;erves as a de|licacy all the year round. There is
&s;carce a cottage in tho&s;e countries that is not hung round with the&s;e
marks of ho&s;pitality; and which often make the owner better contented with
hunger, &s;ince he has it in his power to be luxurious when he thinks proper. A
piece of beef hung up there, is con&s;idered as an elegant piece of furniture,
which, though &s;eldom touched, at lea&s;t argues the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's
opulence and ea&s;e. But it is very different, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, in this
country, where our lower ru&s;tics at lea&s;t are utterly unable to purcha&s;e
meat any part of the year, and by them even butter is con&s;idered as an
article of extravagance.</P>
<P>The climate and pa&s;ture of Great Britain, however, is excellently
adapted to this animal's moderate nature; and the verdure and the fer|tility of
our plains are perfectly &s;uited to the manner of its feeding; for wanting the
upper fore teeth, it loves to graze in an high rich <PB N="10" REF="13">
pa&s;ture. This animal &s;eems but little regardful of the quality of its food,
provided it be &s;up|plied in &s;ufficient abundance; it makes no par|ticular
di&s;tinctions in the choice of its herbage, but indi&s;criminately and
ha&s;tily devours the proper quantity. For this rea&s;on, in our pa&s;tures,
where the gra&s;s is rather high than &s;ucculent, more flouri&s;hing than
nutritious, the cow thrives admirably; and there is no part of Europe where the
tame animal grows &s;o large, yields more milk, or more readily fattens, than
with us.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;tures &s;upply them with abundance, and they in return
enrich the pa&s;ture; for, of all animals, the cow &s;eems to give back more
than it takes from the &s;oil. The hor&s;e and the &s;heep are known, in a
cour&s;e of years, to impo|veri&s;h the ground. The land where they have fed
becomes weedy, and the vegetables coar&s;e and unpalatable: on the contrary,
the pa&s;ture where the cow has been bred, acquires a finer &s;ofter &s;urface,
and becomes every year more beautiful and even. The rea&s;on is, that the
hor&s;e being furni&s;hed with fore teeth in the upper jaw, nips the gra&s;s
clo&s;ely, and, therefore, only chu&s;es that which is the mo&s;t delicate and
ten|der; the &s;heep al&s;o, though, with re&s;pect to its teeth, formed like
the cow, only bites the mo&s;t <PB N="11" REF="14"> &s;ucculent parts of the
herbage: the&s;e animals, therefore, leave all the high weeds &s;tanding; and
while they cut the finer gra&s;s too clo&s;ely, &s;uffer the ranker herbage to
vegetate and over|run the pa&s;ture. But it is otherwi&s;e with the cow; as its
teeth cannot come &s;o clo&s;e to the ground as tho&s;e of the hor&s;e, nor
&s;o readily as tho&s;e of the &s;heep, which are le&s;s, it is obliged to feed
upon the talle&s;t vegetables that offer; thus it eats them all down, and, in
time, levels the &s;urface of the pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>The age of the cow is known by the teeth and horns. This animal is
furni&s;hed with eight cutting teeth in the lower jaw; at the age of ten
months, the two middlemo&s;t of the&s;e fall out, and are replaced by others,
that are not &s;o white, but broader; at the age of &s;ixteen months, the two
next milk-white teeth fall out likewi&s;e, and others come up in their room:
thus, at the end of every &s;ix months, the creature lo&s;es and gains, till,
at the age of three years, all the cutting teeth are renewed, and then they are
long, pretty white and equal; but in proportion as the animal ad|vances in
years, they become irregular and black, their inequalities become &s;moother,
and the animal le&s;s capable of chewing its food. Thus the cow often declines
from this &s;ingle cau&s;e; for as it is obliged to eat <PB N="12" REF="15"> a
great deal to &s;upport life, and as the &s;mooth|ne&s;s of the teeth makes the
difficulty of chewing great, a &s;ufficient quantity of food cannot be
&s;upplied to the &s;tomach. Thus the poor animal &s;inks in the mid&s;t of
plenty, and every year grows leaner and leaner, till it dies.</P>
<P>The horns are another, and a &s;urer method of determining this
animal's age. At three years old, it &s;heds its horns, and new ones ari&s;e in
their place, which continue as long as it lives; at four years of age, the cow
has &s;mall pointed neat &s;mooth horns, thicke&s;t near the head; at five the
horns become larger, and are marked round with the former year's growth. Thus,
while the animal continues to live, the horns continue to lengthen; and every
year a new ring is added at the root; &s;o that allowing three years before
their appearance, and then reckoning the number of rings, we have in both
together the animal's age exactly.</P>
<P>As we have indi&s;putably the be&s;t breed of horned cattle of any
in Europe, &s;o it was not without the &s;ame a&s;&s;iduity that we came to
excel in the&s;e, as in our hor&s;es. The breed of cows has been entirely
improved by a foreign mix|ture, properly adapted to &s;upply the imper|fections
of our own. Such as are purely Briti&s;h, <PB N="13" REF="16"> are far inferior
in &s;ize to tho&s;e on many parts of the continent; but tho&s;e which we have
thus improved, by far excel all others. Our Lincoln|&s;hire kind derive their
&s;ize from the Hol&s;tein breed: and the large hornle&s;s cattle that are bred
in &s;ome parts of England, came originally from Poland. We were once famous
for a wild breed of the&s;e animals, but the&s;e have long &s;ince been worn
out; and perhaps no kingdom in Europe can furni&s;h &s;o few wild animals of
all kinds, as our own. Cultivation and agri|culture are &s;ure to bani&s;h
the&s;e, wherever they are found; and every addition a country re|ceives from
art, drives away tho&s;e animals that are only, fitted for a &s;tate of
nature.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupedes, the cow &s;eems mo&s;t liable to alteration from
its pa&s;ture. In the dif|ferent parts of our own country, we ea&s;ily
per|ceive the great varieties produced among the&s;e animals, by the richne&s;s
or poverty of the &s;oil. In &s;ome they grow to a great bulk; and I have
&s;een an ox &s;ixteen hands high, which is taller than the general run of our
hor&s;es. In others, they appear as diminutive; being not &s;o large as an
a&s;s. The breed of the I&s;le of Man, and mo&s;t parts of Scotland, is much
le&s;s in ge|neral than in England or Ireland: they are differently &s;haped
al&s;o, the dewlap being much <PB N="14" REF="17"> &s;maller, and, as the
expre&s;&s;ion is, the bea&s;t has more of the ewe neck. This, till &s;ome
years ago, was con&s;idered in cattle as a defor|mity; and the cow was
cho&s;en, according to Virgil's direction, with a large dewlap: how|ever, at
pre&s;ent it is the univer&s;al opinion, that the cow wants in udder what it
has in neck, and the larger the dewlap, the &s;maller is the quantity of its
milk. Our graziers now, therefore, endeavour to mix the two breeds; the large
Hol&s;tein with the &s;mall northern; and from both re&s;ults that fine milch
breed, which excels the cattle of any other part of the world.</P>
<P>This difference, ari&s;ing from pa&s;ture, is more ob&s;ervable in
other countries than in our own. The cow kind is to be found in almo&s;t every
part of the world, large in proportion to the richne&s;s of the pa&s;ture; and
&s;mall, as the animal is &s;tinted in its food. Thus Africa is re|markable for
the large&s;t and the &s;malle&s;t cattle of this kind; as is al&s;o India,
Poland, Switzer|land, and &s;everal other parts of Europe. Among the Eluth
Tartars, where the pa&s;tures are re|markably rich and nouri&s;hing, the cow
be|comes &s;o large, that he mu&s;t be a tall man who can reach the tip of its
&s;houlder. On the con|trary, in France, where the animal is &s;tinted in 
<PB N="15" REF="18"> its food, and driven from the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing
pa&s;tures, it greatly degenerates.</P>
<P>But the differences in the &s;ize of this animal are not &s;o
remarkable as tho&s;e which are found in its form, its hair, and its horns. The
differ|ence is &s;o very extraordinary in many of them, that they have been
even con&s;idered as a dif|ferent kind of creature, and names have been given
them as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, when in reality they are all the &s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxiii. p. 78.</BIBL></NOTE>. In this
manner the urus and the bi&s;on have been con&s;idered, from the va|riety in
their make, to be di&s;tinct in their pro|duction; but they are all in fact the
de&s;cendants of one common &s;tock, as they have that certain mark of unity,
they breed and propagate among each other. Naturali&s;ts have therefore
laboured under an obvious error, when, becau&s;e of the extreme bulk of the
urus, or becau&s;e of the hump upon the back of the bi&s;on, they a&s;&s;igned
them different places in the creation, and &s;epa|rated a cla&s;s of animals
which was really united. It is true, the hor&s;e and the a&s;s do not differ
&s;o much in form, as the cow and the bi&s;on; ne|verthele&s;s, the former, are
di&s;tinct animals, as their breed is marked with &s;terility; the latter are
animals of the &s;ame kind, as their breed is fruitful, and a race of animals
is produced, in <PB N="16" REF="19"> which the hump belonging to the bi&s;on is
&s;oon worn away. The differences, therefore, be|tween the cow, the urus, and
the bi&s;on, are merely accidental. The &s;ame caprice in na|ture that has
given horns to &s;ome cows, and denied them to others, may al&s;o have given
the bi&s;on an hump, or encrea&s;ed the bulk of the urus; it may have given the
one a mane, or denied a &s;ufficiency of hair to the other.</P>
<P>But before we proceed farther, it may be proper to de&s;cribe
the&s;e varieties, which have been thus taken for di&s;tinct kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This de&s;cription is chiefly taken from Klein.</NOTE>. The urus,
or wild bull, is chiefly to be met with in the province of Lithuania; and grows
to a &s;ize, that &s;carce any other animal, except the elephant, is found to
equal. It is quite black, except a &s;tripe mixed with white, that runs from

this animal re&s;embles the tame one very exactly, except in &s;ome trifling
varieties, which his &s;tate of wildne&s;s, or the richne&s;s of the pa&s;tures
where he is found, may ea&s;ily have produced.</P>
<P>The bi&s;on, which is another variety of the cow kind, differs from
the re&s;t, in having a lump between its &s;houlders. The&s;e animals are of
various kinds; &s;ome very large, others as di|minutively little. In general,
to regard this ani|mal's fore parts, he has &s;omewhat the look of a lion, with
a long &s;haggy mane, and a beard under his chin; his head is little, his eyes
red and fiery, with a furious look; the forehead is large, and the horns &s;o
big, and &s;o far a&s;under, that three men might often &s;it between them. On
the middle of the back there grows a bunch almo&s;t as high as that of a camel,
covered with hair, and which is con&s;idered as a great delicacy by tho&s;e
that hunt him. There is no pur&s;uing him with &s;afety, except in fore&s;ts
where there are trees large enough to hide the hunters. He is generally taken
by pit-falls; the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries where he is found wild,
dig|ing holes in the ground, and covering them over with boughs of trees and
gra&s;s; then pro|voking the bi&s;on to pur&s;ue them, they get on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the pit fall, while the furious <PB REF="22">

running head foremo&s;t, falls into the pit prepared for him, and is there
quickly over|come and &s;lain.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e real di&s;tinctions in the cow kind, there have
been many others made, that appear to be in name only. Thus the bona&s;us, of
which naturali&s;ts have given us long de|&s;criptions, is &s;uppo&s;ed by
Klein and Buffon to be no more than another name for the bi&s;on, as the
de&s;criptions given of them by the ancients coincide. The bubalus al&s;o of
the ancients, which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the cow kind, Buffon
places among the lower cla&s;s of ruminant quadrupedes, as it mo&s;t
re&s;embles them in &s;ize, &s;hape, and the figure of its horns. Of all the
varieties, therefore, of the cow kind, there are but two that are really
di&s;tinct; namely, the cow, and the buffalo: the&s;e two are &s;eparated by
nature; they &s;eem to bear an antipathy to each other; they avoid each other,
and may be con&s;idered as much removed as the hor&s;e is from the a&s;s or the
zebra. When, therefore, we have de&s;cribed the varieties of the cow kind, we
&s;hall pa&s;s on to the buffalo, which being a different animal, requires a
&s;eparate hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a part of the world, as was &s;aid before, in
which the cow is not found in <PB N="19" REF="25"> &s;ome one of its varieties;
either large, like the urus, or humped as the bi&s;on; with &s;trait horns, or
bending, inverted backwards, or turning &s;ide|ways to the cheek, like tho&s;e
of the ram; and, in many countries, they are found without any horns
what&s;oever. But to be more particular, beginning at the north, the few kine
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Iceland, are without horns, although of the &s;ame race
originally with ours. The &s;ize of the&s;e is rather relative to the
goodne&s;s of the pa&s;ture, than the warmth or coldne&s;s of the climate. The
Dutch frequently bring great quantities of lean cattle from Denmark, which they
fatten on their own rich grounds. The&s;e are in general of a larger &s;ize
than their own natural breed; and they fatten very ea&s;ily. The cattle of the
Ukraine, where the pa&s;ture is ex|cellent, become very fat, and are
con&s;idered as the large&s;t breed of all Europe. In Switzer|land, where the
mountains are covered with a rich nouri&s;hing herbage, which is entirely
re|&s;erved for their kine, the&s;e animals grow to a very large &s;ize. On the
contrary, in France, where they get no other gra&s;s but what is thought unfit
for hor&s;es, they dwindle, and grow lean. In &s;ome parts of Spain, the cow
grows to a good &s;ize; tho&s;e wild bulls, how|ever, which they pride
them&s;elves &s;o much in <PB N="20" REF="26"> combating, are a very mean
de&s;picable little animal, and &s;omewhat &s;haped like one of our cows, with
nothing of that peculiar &s;ternne&s;s of a&s;pect for which our bulls are
remarkable. In Barbary, and the provinces of Africa, where the ground is dry,
and the pa&s;turage &s;hort, the cows are of a very &s;mall breed, and give
milk in proportion. On the contrary, in Ethiopia, they are of a prodigious
bigne&s;s. The &s;ame holds in Per&s;ia and Tartary; where, in &s;ome places,
they are very &s;mall, and, in others, of an amazing &s;tature It is thus, in
almo&s;t every part of the world, this animal is found to cor|re&s;pond in
&s;ize to the quantity of its pro|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we examine the form of the&s;e animals, as they are found tame,
in different regions, we &s;hall find, that the breed of the urus, or tho&s;e
without an hump, chiefly occupies the cold and the temperate zones, and is not
&s;o much di&s;|per&s;ed towards the &s;outh. On the contrary, the breed of the
bi&s;on, or the animal with an hump, is found in all the &s;outhern parts of
the world; throughout the va&s;t continent of India; throughout Africa, from
Mount Atlas to the Cape of Good Hope. In all the&s;e countries, the bi&s;on
&s;eems chiefly to prevail; where they are found to have a &s;mooth &s;oft
hair, are <PB N="21" REF="27"> very nimble of foot, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure
&s;upply the want of hor&s;es. The bi&s;on breed is al&s;o more expert and
docile than ours; many of them, when they carry burthens, bend their knees to
take them up, or &s;et them down: they are treated, therefore, by the natives
of tho&s;e countries, with a degree of tenderne&s;s and care equal to their
utility; and the re&s;pect for them in India has degenerated even into blind
adoration. But it is among the Hottentots where the&s;e animals are chiefly
e&s;teemed, as being more than commonly &s;erviceable. They are their fellow
dome&s;tics, the companions of their plea&s;ures and fatigues; the cow is at
once the Hottentot's protector and &s;ervant, a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in attending
his flocks, and guarding them again&s;t every invader; while the &s;heep are
grazing, the faithful backely, as this kind of cow is called, &s;tands or
grazes be&s;ide them: &s;till, however, attentive to the looks of its ma&s;ter,
the backely flies round the field, herds in the &s;heep that are &s;traying,
obliges them to keep within proper limits, and &s;hews no mercy to robbers, or
even &s;trangers, who attempt to plunder. But it is not the plunderers of the
&s;tock alone, but even the enemies of the na|tion, that the&s;e backelys are
taught to combat. Every army of Hottentots is furni&s;hed with a 
<PB N="22" REF="28"> proper herd of the&s;e, which are let loo&s;e again&s;t
the enemy, when the occa&s;ion is mo&s;t con|venient. Being thus &s;ent
forward, they over|turn all before them; they &s;trike every oppo&s;er down
with their horns, and trample upon them with their feet; and thus often procure
their ma&s;ters an ea&s;y victory, even before they have attempted to &s;trike
a blow. An animal &s;o &s;er|viceable, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, is not without
its reward. The backely lives in the &s;ame cottage with its ma&s;ter, and, by
long habit, gains an affection for him; and in proportion as the man approaches
to the brute, &s;o the brute &s;eems to attain even to &s;ome &s;hare of human
&s;agacity. The Hottentot and his backely thus mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each
other; and when the latter happens to die, a new one is cho&s;en to &s;ucceed
him, by a council of the old men of the village. The new backely is then joined
with one of the ve|terans of his own kind, from whom he learns his art, becomes
&s;ocial and diligent, and is taken for life into human friend&s;hip and
protection.</P>
<P>The bi&s;ons, or cows with an hump, are found to differ very much
from each other in the &s;everal parts of the world where they are found. The
wild ones of this kind, as with us, are much larger than the tame. Some have
horns, and &s;ome are without any; &s;ome <PB N="23" REF="29"> have them
depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome rai&s;ed in &s;uch a manner that they are u&s;ele&s;s
as weapons of an|noyance or defence; &s;ome are extremely large; and others
among them, &s;uch as the zebu, or Barbary cow, are very &s;mall. They are all,
however, equally docile and gentle when tamed; and, in general, furni&s;hed
with a fine lu&s;trous &s;oft hair, more beautiful than that of our own breed;
their hump is al&s;o of different &s;izes, in &s;ome weighing from forty to
fifty pounds, in others le&s;s; it is not, however, to be con&s;idered as a
part nece&s;&s;arily belonging to the animal; and probably it might be cut away
without much injury: it re&s;embles a gri&s;tly fat; and, as I am a&s;&s;ured,
cuts and ta&s;tes &s;omewhat like a dre&s;&s;ed udder. The bi&s;ons of Malabar,
Aby&s;&s;inia, and Madaga&s;car, are of the great kind, as the pa&s;tures there
are plentiful. Tho&s;e of Arabia, Petraea, and mo&s;t parts of Africa, are
&s;mall, and of the zebu or little kind. In America, e&s;pecially towards the
north, the bi&s;on is well known. The American bi&s;on, however, is found to be
rather le&s;s than that of the ancient continent; its hair is longer and
thicker, its beard more remarkable, and its hide more lu&s;trous and &s;oft.
There are many of them brought up tame in Carolina; however, their 
<PB N="24" REF="30"> wild di&s;po&s;itions &s;till &s;eem to continue, for they
break through all fences to get into the corn|fields, and lead the whole tame
herd after them, wherever they penetrate. They breed al&s;o with the tame kinds
originally brought over from Europe; and thus produce a race peculiar to that
country.</P>
<P>From all this it appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xxiii. p. 130.</BIBL></NOTE>, that naturali&s;ts have given various names to
animals in reality the &s;ame, and only differing in &s;ome few accidental
circum&s;tances. The wild cow and the tame, the animal belonging to Europe, and
that of A&s;ia, Africa, and America, the bonafus and the urus, the bi&s;on and
the zebu, are all one and the &s;ame, propagate among each other, and, in the
cour&s;e of a few generations, the hump wears away, and &s;carce any ve&s;tiges
of &s;avage fiercene&s;s are found to remain. Of all animals, therefore, except
man alone, the cow &s;eems mo&s;t exten&s;ively propagated. Its nature &s;eems
equally capable of the rigours of heat and cold. It is an inhabitant as well of
the frozen fields of Iceland, as the burning de&s;arts of Lybia. It &s;eems an
ancient inmate in every climate, do|me&s;tic and tame in tho&s;e countries
which have been civilized, &s;avage and wild in the countries which are le&s;s
peopled, but capable of being <PB N="25" REF="31"> made u&s;eful in all: able
to defend it&s;elf in a &s;tate of nature again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful enemy
of the fore&s;t; and only &s;ubordinate to man, who&s;e force it has
experienced, and who&s;e aid it at la&s;t &s;eems to require. However wild the
calves are which are taken from the dam in a &s;avage &s;tate, either in Africa
or A&s;ia, they &s;oon become humble, patient, and familiar, and man may be
con&s;idered, in tho&s;e countries, as almo&s;t helple&s;s without their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Other animals pre&s;erve their nature or their form with
inflexible per&s;everance; but the&s;e, in every re|&s;pect, &s;uit
them&s;elves to the appetites and con|veniencies of mankind; and as their
&s;hapes are found to alter, &s;o al&s;o does their nature; in no animal is
there &s;een a greater variety of kinds, and in none a more humble and pliant
di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE BUFFALO.</HEAD>
<P>IF we &s;hould compare the &s;hape of our com|mon cow with that of
the bi&s;on, the difference will appear very great. The &s;haggy mane of the
latter, the beard, the curled forehead, the inverted horns, the broad brea&s;t,
and the narrow hinder parts, give it the appearance rather of 
<PB N="26" REF="32"> a lion than a cow; and fit it more for a &s;tate of war
with mankind, than a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
appearances, both animals are found to be the &s;ame; or at lea&s;t &s;o nearly
allied, that they breed among each other, and propagate a race that continues
the kind.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if we compare the buffalo with our common cow,
no two animals can be more nearly alike, either in their form or their nature;
both equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the yoke, both often living under the &s;ame
roof, and em|ployed in the &s;ame dome&s;tic &s;ervices; the make and the turn
of their bodies &s;o much alike, that it requires a clo&s;e attention to
di&s;tingui&s;h them: and yet, after all this, no two animals can be more
di&s;tinct, or &s;eem to have &s;tronger anti|pathies to each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. Were there but one of each kind
remaining, it is probable the race of both would &s;hortly be extinct. However,
&s;uch is the fixed aver&s;ion formed between the&s;e creatures, that the cow
refu&s;es to breed with the buffalo, which it nearly re&s;embles; while it is
known to propagate with the bi&s;on, to which it has, in point of form, but a
very di&s;tant &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>The buffalo is, upon the whole, by no means &s;o beautiful a
creature as the cow; his figure <PB N="27" REF="33"> is more clum&s;y and
aukward; his air is wilder; and he carries his head lower, and nearer the
ground; his limbs are le&s;s fle&s;hy, and his tail more naked of hair; his
body is &s;horter and thicker than that of the cow kind; his legs are higher;
his head &s;maller; his horns not &s;o round, black, and compre&s;&s;ed, with a
bunch of curled hair hanging down between them; his &s;kin is al&s;o harder and
thicker, more black, and le&s;s furni&s;hed with hair; his fle&s;h, which is
hard and blacki&s;h, is not only di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te, but likewi&s;e
to the &s;mell. The milk of the female is by no means &s;o good as that of the
cow; it is however produced in great abundance. In the warm countries, almo&s;t
all their chee&s;e is made of the milk of the buffalo; and they &s;upply butter
al&s;o in large quantities. The veal of the young buffalo is not better eating
than the beef of the old. The hide of this animal &s;eems to be the mo&s;t
valuable thing he furni&s;hes. The leather made of it is well known for its
thickne&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, and impene|trability. As the&s;e animals are, in
general, larger and &s;tronger than the cow, they are u&s;e|fully employed in
agriculture. They are u&s;ed in drawing burthens, and &s;ometimes in carrying
them; being guided by a ring, which is thru&s;t through their no&s;e. Two
buffaloes yoaked in a <PB N="28" REF="34"> waggon are &s;aid to draw more than
four &s;trong hor&s;es; as their heads and necks are naturally bent downward,
they are thus better fitted for the draught, and the whole weight of their
bodies is applied to the carriage that is to be drawn forward.</P>
<P>From the &s;ize and bulk of the buffalo, we may be ea&s;ily led to
conclude that he is a native of the warmer climates. The large&s;t quadru|pedes
are generally found in the torrid zone; and the buffalo is inferior, in point
of &s;ize, only to the elephant, the rhinoceros, or the hippopotamos. The
camelopard, or the camel, may, indeed, be taller, but they are neither &s;o
long, or near &s;o corpulent. Accordingly, we find this animal wild in many
parts of India; and tamed al&s;o wherever the natives have oc|ca&s;ion for his
&s;ervices. The wild buffaloes are very dangerous animals, and are often found
to gore travellers to death, and then trample them with their feet, until they
have entirely mangled the whole body: however, in the woods they are not &s;o
much to be feared as in the plains, becau&s;e in the violence of their
pur&s;uit their large horns are apt to be entangled in the branches of the
trees, which gives tho&s;e who have been &s;urprized by them, time to e&s;cape
the danger. There is &s;carce any <PB N="29" REF="35"> other method of avoiding
their pur&s;uit; they run with great &s;wiftne&s;s; they overturn a tree of
moderate growth; and are &s;uch &s;wimmers, as to cro&s;s the large&s;t rivers
without any difficulty. In this manner, like all other large animals of the
torrid zone, they are very fond of the water; and, in the mid&s;t of their
pur&s;uit, often plunge in, in order to cool them&s;elves. The Negroes of
Guinea, and the Indians of Malabar, where buffaloes are in great abundance,
take great delight in hunting and de&s;troying them; how|ever, they never
attempt to face the buffalo openly, but, generally climbing up a tree, &s;hoot
at him from thence, and do not come down till they find they have effectually
di&s;patched him. However, when they are tamed, no animal can be more patient
or humble; and though by no means &s;o docile as the cow kind, yet they go
through dome&s;tic drudgeries with more &s;trength and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e animals be chiefly found in the torrid zone, yet
they are bred in &s;everal parts of Europe, particularly in Italy, where they
make the food and the riches of the poor. The female produces but one at a
time, in the &s;ame manner as the cow; but they are very dif|ferent in the
times of ge&s;tation; for the cow, as we know, goes but nine months; whereas
the <PB N="30" REF="36"> buffalo continues pregnant for twelve. They are all
afraid of fire; and, perhaps, in con&s;e|quence of this, have an aver&s;ion to
red colours, that re&s;emble the colour of flame: it is &s;aid, that in tho&s;e
countries where they are found in plenty, no per&s;on dares to dre&s;s in
&s;carlet. In general they are inoffen&s;ive animals, if un|di&s;turbed; as
indeed all tho&s;e which feed upon gra&s;s are found to be; but when they are
wounded, or when even but fired at, nothing then can &s;top their fury; they
then turn up the ground with their fore feet, bellow much louder and more
terribly than the bull, and make at the object of their re&s;entment with
un|governable rage. It is happy, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, if the per&s;on
they pur&s;ue has a wall to e&s;cape over, or &s;ome &s;uch ob&s;tacle,
otherwi&s;e they &s;oon overtake, and in&s;tantly de&s;troy him. It is
remarkable, however, that although their horns are &s;o very formidable, they
in general make more u&s;e of their feet in combat, and rather tread their
enemies to death than gore them.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals, it may
be proper to ob&s;erve, that no names have been more indi&s;criminately u&s;ed
than tho&s;e of the bull, the urus, the bi&s;on, and the buffalo. It therefore
becomes &s;uch as <PB N="31" REF="37"> would have di&s;tinct ideas of each, to
be careful in &s;eparating the kinds, the one from the other, allowing the cow
for the &s;tandard of all. The urus, whether of the large enormous kind of
Lithuania, or the &s;maller race of Spain, whether with long or &s;hort horns,
whether with or with|out long hair in the forehead, is every way the &s;ame
with what our common breed was before they were taken from the fore&s;t, and
reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. The bi&s;on, and all its varieties, which
are known by an hump between the &s;houlders, is al&s;o to be ranked in the
&s;ame cla&s;s. This animal, whether with crooked or &s;trait horns, whether
they be turned towards the cheek, or totally wanting, whether it be large or
diminutive, whatever be its colour, or whatever the length of its hair, whether
called the bona&s;us by &s;ome, or the bubalus by others, is but a variety of
the cow kind, with whom it breeds, and with whom of con&s;equence it has the
clo&s;e&s;t connection. La&s;tly, the buffalo, though &s;haped much more like
the cow, is a di&s;tinct kind by it&s;elf, that never mixes with any of the
former; that goes twelve months with young; whereas the cow goes but nine; that
te&s;tifies an aver&s;ion to the latter; and, though bred under the &s;ame
roof, or feeding in the &s;ame pa&s;ture, has always kept &s;eparate; and 
<PB N="32" REF="38"> makes a di&s;tinct race in all parts of the world. The&s;e
two kinds are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only real varieties in the cow kind, of
which natu|rali&s;ts have given &s;o many varieties. With re|&s;pect to &s;ome
circum&s;tances mentioned by tra|vellers, &s;uch as that of many kinds
defending them&s;elves by voiding their dung again&s;t their pur&s;uers; this
is a practice which they have in common with other timid creatures when
pur|&s;ued, and ari&s;es rather from fear than a de&s;ire of defence. The
mu&s;ky &s;mell al&s;o by which &s;ome have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, is found
common to many of the&s;e kinds, in a &s;tate of nature; and does not properly
make the characteri&s;tic marks of any. The particular kind of noi&s;e al&s;o
which &s;ome of them are known to make, which rather re&s;embles grunting than
bellow|ing or lowing, is but a &s;avage variety, which many wild animals have,
and yet lo&s;e when brought into a &s;tate of tamene&s;s. For the&s;e
rea&s;ons, Mr. Buffon, whom I have followed in this de&s;cription, is of
opinion, that the zebu, or little African cow, and the grunting, or Sibe|rian
cow, are but different races of the bi&s;on; as the &s;hape of the horns, or
the length of the hair, are never properly characteri&s;tic marks of any
animal, but are found to vary with climate, food, and cultivation.</P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="42">In this manner the number of animals of the
cow kind, which naturali&s;ts have extended to eight or ten &s;orts, are
reduced to two; and as the utmo&s;t deference is paid to the opinion of Mr.
Buffon in this particular, I have taken him for my guide. Neverthele&s;s, there
is an animal of the cow kind, which neither he, nor any other naturali&s;t that
I know of, has hitherto de|&s;cribed, yet which makes a very di&s;tinct
cla&s;s, and may be added as a third &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This animal was &s;hewn &s;ome years ago in London, and &s;eemed
to unite many of the characteri&s;tics of the cow and the hog; hav|ing the
head, the horns, and the tail of the former; with the bri&s;tles, the colour,
and the grunting of the latter. It was about the &s;ize of an a&s;s, but
broader and thicker; the colour re&s;embling that of an hog, and the hair
bri&s;tly, as in that animal. The hair upon the body was thin, as in the hog;
and a row of bri&s;tles ran along the &s;pine, rather &s;horter and &s;ofter
than in the hog kind. The head was rather larger than that of a cow; the teeth
were en|tirely re&s;embling tho&s;e of that animal, and the tongue was rough in
like manner. It fed upon hay; and, con&s;equently, its internal confor|mation
mu&s;t have re&s;embled that of the cow <PB N="34" REF="43"> kind more than the
hog, who&s;e food is always cho&s;en of a kind more &s;ucculent. The eyes were
placed in the head as with the cow, and were pretty nearly of the &s;ame
colour; the horns were black and flatti&s;h, but bent rather backwards to the
neck, as in the goat kind; the neck was &s;hort and thick, and the back rather
ri&s;ing in the middle; it was cloven footed, like the cow, without tho&s;e
hinder claws that are found in the hog kinds. But the greate&s;t variety of all
in this extraordinary creature, which was a female, was, that it had but two
teats, and, con&s;e|quently, in that re&s;pect, re&s;embled neither of the
kinds to which, in other circum&s;tances, it bore &s;o &s;trong a &s;imilitude.
Whether this ani|mal was a di&s;tinct kind, or a mon&s;ter, I will not pretend
to &s;ay; it was &s;hewn under the name of the bonafus; and it was &s;aid, by
the per|&s;on who &s;hewed it, to have come from India: but no credit is to be
given to intere&s;ted ig|norance; the per&s;on only wanted to make the animal
appear as extraordinary as po&s;&s;ible; and I believe would &s;carcely
&s;cruple a lie or two, to encrea&s;e that wonder in us, by which he found the
means of living.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Animals of the Sheep and Goat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>AS no two animals are found entirely the &s;ame, &s;o it is not to
be expected that any two races of animals &s;hould exactly corre&s;pond in
every particular. The goat and the &s;heep are apparently different, in the
form of their bodies, in their covering, and in their horns. They may from
hence be con&s;idered as two different kinds, with regard to all common and
dome&s;tic pur|po&s;es. But if we come to examine them clo&s;er, and ob&s;erve
their internal conformation, no two animals can be more alike; their feet,
their four &s;tomachs, their &s;uet, their appetites, all are entirely the
&s;ame, and &s;hew the &s;imilitude between them: but what makes a much
&s;tronger connection is, that they propagate with each other. The buck goat is
found to pro|duce with the ewe an animal that in two or three generations
returns to the &s;heep, and &s;eems to retain no marks of its ancient
pro|genitor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
&s;heep and the goat, therefore, may be con&s;idered as belonging to one
fa|mily; and were the whole races reduced to one <PB N="36" REF="45"> of each,
they would quickly repleni&s;h the earth with their kind.</P>
<P>If we examine the &s;heep and goat internally, we &s;hall find, as
was &s;aid, that their confor|mation is entirely the &s;ame; nor is their
&s;tructure very remote from that of the cow kind, which they re&s;emble in
their hoofs, and in their chew|ing the cud. Indeed, all ruminant animals are
internally very much alike. The goat, the &s;heep, or the deer, exhibit to the
eye of the anatomi&s;t the &s;ame parts in miniature, which the cow or the
bi&s;on exhibited in the great. But the differ|ences between tho&s;e animals
are, neverthele&s;s, &s;ufficiently apparent. Nature has obviou&s;ly marked the
di&s;tinctions between the cow and the &s;heep kind, by their form and &s;ize;
and they are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the deer kind, by never
&s;hedding their horns. In|deed, the form and figure of the&s;e animals, if
there were nothing el&s;e, would &s;eldom fail of guiding us to the kind; and
we might almo&s;t, upon &s;ight, tell which belongs to the deer kind, and which
are to be degraded into that of the goat. However, the annually &s;hedding the
horns in the deer, and the permanence in the &s;heep, draws a pretty exact line
between the kinds; &s;o that we may hold to this di&s;tinction only, and define
the &s;heep and goat kind as ru|minant <PB N="37" REF="46"> animals of a
&s;maller &s;ize, that never &s;hed their horns.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the&s;e harmle&s;s and u&s;eful ani|mals in one
point of view, we &s;hall find that both have been long reclaimed, and brought
into a &s;tate of dome&s;tic &s;ervitude. Both &s;eem to require protection
from man; and are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, plea&s;ed with his &s;ociety. The
&s;heep, indeed, is the more &s;erviceable creature of the two; but the goat
has more &s;en&s;ibility and attachment. The attending upon both was once the
employment of the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t of men; and tho&s;e have been ever
&s;uppo&s;ed the happie&s;t times, in which the&s;e harmle&s;s creatures were
con&s;idered as the chief objects of human attention. In the earlie&s;t ages,
the goat &s;eemed rather the greater favourite; and, indeed, it continues
&s;uch to this day among the poor. However, the &s;heep has long &s;ince become
the principal object of human care; while the goat is di&s;regarded by the
generality of mankind, or become the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only of the lowe&s;t of
the people. The &s;heep, therefore, and its varieties, may be con&s;idered
fir&s;t; and the goat, with all tho&s;e of its kind, will then properly
follow.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="47">
<HEAD>THE SHEEP.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals that take refuge under the protection of man, in a
few generations be|come indolent and helple&s;s. Having lo&s;t the habit of
&s;elf-defence, they &s;eem to lo&s;e al&s;o the in&s;tincts of nature. The
&s;heep, in its pre&s;ent dome&s;tic &s;tate, is of all animals the mo&s;t
de|fencele&s;s and inoffen&s;ive. With its liberty it &s;eems to have been
deprived of its &s;wiftne&s;s and cunning; and what in the a&s;s might rather
be called patience, in the &s;heep appears to be &s;tupidity. With no one
quality to fit it for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, it makes vain efforts at all.
Without &s;wiftne&s;s, it endeavours to fly; and without &s;trength,
&s;ometimes offers to oppo&s;e. But the&s;e feeble attempts rather incite than
re|pre&s;s the in&s;ults of every enemy; and the dog follows the flock with
greater delight upon &s;eeing them fly, and attacks them with more fiercene&s;s
upon their un&s;upported attempts at re&s;i&s;tance. Indeed they run together
in flocks; rather with the hopes of lo&s;ing their &s;ingle danger in the
crowd, than of uniting to repre&s;s the attack by numbers. The &s;heep,
therefore, were it expo&s;ed in its pre&s;ent &s;tate to &s;truggle with its
natural enemies of the fore&s;t, it would <PB N="39" REF="48"> &s;oon be
extirpated. Loaded with an heavy fleece, deprived of the defence of its horns,
and rendered heavy, &s;low, and feeble, it can have no other &s;afety but what
it finds from man. This animal is now, therefore, obliged to rely &s;olely upon
that art for protection, to which it originally owes its degradation.</P>
<P>But we are not to impute to Nature the formation of an animal &s;o
utterly unprovided again&s;t its enemies, and &s;o unfit for defence. The
moufflon, which is the &s;heep in a &s;avage &s;tate, is a bold, fleet
creature, able to e&s;cape from the greater animals by its &s;wiftne&s;s, or to
oppo&s;e the &s;maller kinds with the arms it has received from Nature. It is
by human art alone that the &s;heep is become the tardy de|fencele&s;s creature
we find it. Every race of quadrupedes might ea&s;ily be corrupted by the &s;ame
allurements by which the &s;heep has been thus debilitated and depre&s;&s;ed.
While undi|&s;turbed, and properly &s;upplied, none are found to &s;et any
bounds to their appetite. They all pur&s;ue their food while able, and continue
to graze, till they often die of di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by too much
fatne&s;s. But it is very different with them in a &s;tate of nature: they are
in the fore&s;t &s;urrounded by dangers, and alarmed with uncea&s;ing
ho&s;tilities; they are pur&s;ued <PB N="40" REF="49"> every hour from one
tract of country to ano|ther; and &s;pend a great part of their time in
attempts to avoid their enemies. Thus con|&s;tantly exerci&s;ed, and
continually practi&s;ing all the arts of defence and e&s;cape, the animal at
once pre&s;erves its life and native independance, together with its
&s;wiftne&s;s, and the &s;lender agi|lity of its form.</P>
<P>The &s;heep, in its &s;ervile &s;tate, &s;eems to be di|ve&s;ted
of all inclinations of its own; and of all animals it appears the mo&s;t
&s;tupid. Every qua|drupede has a peculiar turn of countenance, a
phy&s;iognomy, if we may &s;o call it, that generally marks its nature. The
&s;heep &s;eems to have none of tho&s;e traits that betoken either courage or
cunning; its large eyes, &s;eparated from each other, its ears &s;ticking out
on each &s;ide, and its narrow no&s;trils, all te&s;tify the extreme
&s;impli|city of this creature; and the po&s;ition of its horns al&s;o, &s;hew
that Nature de&s;igned the &s;heep rather for flight than combat. It appears a
large ma&s;s of fle&s;h, &s;upported upon four &s;mall &s;trait legs, ill
fitted for carrying &s;uch a burthen; its mo|tions are aukward, it is ea&s;ily
fatigued, and often &s;inks under the weight of its own cor|pulency. In
proportion as the&s;e marks of human transformation are more numerous, the
animal becomes more helple&s;s and &s;tupid. Tho&s;e which live upon a more
fertile pa&s;ture, <PB N="41" REF="50"> and grow fat, become entirely feeble;
tho&s;e that want horns, are found more dull and heavy than the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Daubenton upon the Sheep.</BIBL></NOTE>; tho&s;e
who&s;e fleeces are longe&s;t and fine&s;t, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to a variety
of di&s;orders; and, in &s;hort, whatever changes have been wrought in this
animal by the in|du&s;try of man, are entirely calculated for human advantage,
and not for that of the creature it&s;elf. It might require a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of ages, before the &s;heep could be re&s;tored to its primitive &s;tate of
activity, &s;o as to become a match for its pur&s;uers of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The goat, which it re&s;embles in &s;o many other re&s;pects, is
much its &s;uperior. The one has its particular attachments, &s;ees danger, and
generally contrives to e&s;cape it; but the other is timid without a cau&s;e,
and &s;ecure when real danger approaches. Nor is the &s;heep, when bred up tame
in the hou&s;e, and familiarized with its keepers, le&s;s ob&s;tinately
ab&s;urd: from being dull and timid, it then acquires a de|gree of pert
familiarity; buts with its head, be|comes mi&s;chievous, and &s;hews it&s;elf
every way unworthy of being &s;ingled out from the re&s;t of the flock. Thus it
&s;eems rather formed for &s;lavery than friend&s;hip; and framed more for the
nece&s;&s;ities than the amu&s;ements of <PB N="42" REF="51"> mankind. There is
but one in&s;tance in which the &s;heep &s;hews any attachment to its keeper;
and that is &s;een rather on the continent, than among us in Great Britain.
What I allude to is, their following the &s;ound of the &s;hepherd's pipe.
Before I had &s;een them trained in this manner, I had no conception of tho&s;e
de&s;crip|tions in the old pa&s;toral poets, of the &s;hepherd leading his
flock from one country to another. As I had been u&s;ed only to &s;ee the&s;e
harmle&s;s creatures driven before their keepers, I &s;up|po&s;ed that all the
re&s;t was but invention: but in many parts of the Alps, and even &s;ome
provinces of France, the &s;hepherd and his pipe are &s;till continued, with
true antique &s;implicity. The flock is regularly penned every evening, to
pre|&s;erve them from the wolf; and the &s;hepherd re|turns homeward at
&s;un-&s;et, with his &s;heep fol|lowing him, and &s;eemingly plea&s;ed with
the &s;ound of the pipe, which is blown with a reed, and re&s;embles the
chanter of a bag-pipe. In this manner, in tho&s;e countries that &s;till
con|tinue poor, the Arcadian life is pre&s;erved in all its former purity; but
in countries where a greater inequality of conditions prevail, the &s;hepherd
is generally &s;ome poor wretch who attends a flock from which he is to derive
no <PB N="43" REF="52"> benefits, and only guards tho&s;e luxuries which he is
not fated to &s;hare</P>
<P>It does not appear, from early writers, that the &s;heep was bred
in Britain; and it was not till &s;everal ages after this animal was
cultivated, that the woollen manufacture was carried on among us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol. i. p. 23.</BIBL></NOTE>. That
valuable branch of bu&s;ine&s;s lay for a con&s;iderable time in foreign hands;
and we were obliged to import the cloth, manu|factured from our own materials.
There were, notwith&s;tanding, many unavailing efforts among our kings to
introduce and pre&s;erve the manu|facture at home. Henry the Second, by a
pa|tent granted to the weavers in London, directed, that if any cloth was found
made of a mixture of Spani&s;h wool, it &s;hould be burned by the mayor. Such
edicts at length, although but &s;low|ly, operated towards the e&s;tabli&s;hing
this trade among us. The Flemings, who at the revival of arts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the art of cloth-working in a &s;upe|rior degree, were invited to &s;ettle
here; and, &s;oon after, foreign cloth was prohibited from being worn in
England. In the times of queen Elizabeth, this manufacture received every
en|couragement; and many of the inhabitants of the Netherlands being then
forced, by the tyranny of Spain, to take refuge in this <PB N="44" REF="53">
country, they improved us in tho&s;e arts, in which we at pre&s;ent excell the
re&s;t of the world. Every art, however, has its ri&s;e, its meridian, and its
decline; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed by many, that the woollen manufacture has for
&s;ome time been decaying among&s;t us. The cloth now made is thought to be
much wor&s;e than that of &s;ome years pa&s;t; being neither &s;o firm nor &s;o
fine, neither &s;o much courted abroad, nor &s;o &s;erviceable at home.</P>
<P>No country, however, produces &s;uch &s;heep as England; either
with larger fleeces, or better adapted for the bu&s;ine&s;s of cloathing.
Tho&s;e of Spain, indeed, are finer, and we generally require &s;ome of their
wool to work up with our own; but the weight of a Spani&s;h fleece is no way
comparable to one of Lincoln or Warwick&s;hire; and, in tho&s;e counties, it is
no uncommon thing to give fifty guineas for a ram.</P>
<P>The &s;heep without horns are counted the be&s;t &s;ort, becau&s;e
a great part of the animal's nouri&s;hment is &s;uppo&s;ed to go up into the
horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Li&s;le's Hu&s;bandry, vol. ii. p.
155.</BIBL></NOTE>. Sheep, like other ruminant animals, want the upper fore
teeth; but have eight in the lower jaw: two of the&s;e drop, and are re|placed
at two years old; four of them are re|placed <PB N="45" REF="54"> at three
years old; and all at four. The new teeth are ea&s;ily known from the re&s;t,
by their fre&s;hne&s;s and whitene&s;s. There are &s;ome breeds, however, in
England, that never change their teeth at all; the&s;e the &s;hepherds call the
leather mouthed cattle; and, as their teeth are thus longer wearing, they are
gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed to grow old a year or two be|fore the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Li&s;le's Hu&s;bandry, vol. ii. p. 155.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
&s;heep bring forth one or two at a time; and &s;ometimes three or four. The
fir&s;t lamb of an ewe is generally pot|bellied, &s;hort and thick, and of
le&s;s value than tho&s;e of a &s;econd or third production; the third being
&s;uppo&s;ed the be&s;t of all. They bear their young five months; and, by
being hou&s;ed, they bring forth at any time of the year.</P>
<P>But this animal, in its dome&s;tic &s;tate, is too well known to
require a detail of its peculiar habits, or of the arts which have been u&s;ed
to improve the breed. Indeed, in the eye of an ob&s;erver of Nature, every art
which tends to render the creature more helple&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s to it&s;elf,
may be con&s;idered rather as an injury than an improvement; and if we are to
look for this animal in its noble&s;t &s;tate, we mu&s;t &s;eek for it in the
African de&s;ert, or the exten&s;ive plains of Siberia. Among the degenerate 
<PB N="46" REF="55"> de&s;cendants of the wild &s;heep, there have been &s;o
many changes wrought, as entirely to di&s;|gui&s;e the kind, and often to
mi&s;lead the ob|&s;erver. The variety is &s;o great that &s;carce any two
countries has its &s;heep of the &s;ame kind; but there is found a manife&s;t
difference in all, either in the &s;ize, the covering, the &s;hape, or the
horns.</P>
<P>The woolly &s;heep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xxiii. p. 168.</BIBL></NOTE>, as it is &s;een among us, is found only in
Europe, and &s;ome of the tem|perate provinces of A&s;ia. When tran&s;ported
into warmer countries, either into Florida or Guinea, it lo&s;es its wool, and
a&s;&s;umes a co|vering fitted to the climate, becoming hairy and rough; it
there al&s;o lo&s;es its fertility, and its fle&s;h no longer has the &s;ame
flavour. In the &s;ame manner, in the very cold countries, it &s;eems equally
helple&s;s and a &s;tranger; it &s;till requires the uncea&s;ing attention of
mankind for its pre&s;ervation; and although it is found to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as
well in Greenland as in Guinea<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz.</BIBL></NOTE>, yet it &s;eems a natural inhabitant
of neither.</P>
<P>Of the dome&s;tic kinds to be found in the different parts of the
world, be&s;ides our own, which is common in Europe, the fir&s;t variety is to
be &s;een in Iceland, Mu&s;covy, and the colde&s;t climates of the north. This,
which <PB N="47" REF="56"> may be called the Iceland &s;heep, re&s;embles our
breed, in the form of the body and the tail; but differs in a very
extraordinary manner in the number of the horns; being generally found to have
four, and &s;ometimes even eight, growing from different parts of the forehead.
The&s;e are large and formidable; and the animal &s;eems thus fitted by Nature
for a &s;tate of war: how|ever, it is of the nature of the re&s;t of its kind,
being mild, gentle, and timid. Its wool is very different, al&s;o, from that of
the common &s;heep, being long, &s;mooth, and hairy. Its colour is of a dark
brown; and under its outward coat of hair, it has an internal covering, that
rather re&s;embles fur than wool, being fine, &s;hort, and &s;oft.</P>
<P>The &s;econd variety to be found in this ani|mal, is that of the
broad tail'd &s;heep, &s;o com|mon in Tartary, Arabia, Per&s;ia, Barbary,
Sy|ria, and Egypt. This &s;heep is only remarkable for its large and heavy
tail, which is often found to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds. It
&s;ometimes grows a foot broad, and is obliged to be &s;upported by a &s;mall
kind of board, that goes upon wheels. This tail is not covered un|derneath with
wool, like the upper part, but is bare; and the natives, who con&s;ider it as a
very great delicacy, are very careful in attending and <PB N="48" REF="57">
pre&s;erving it from injury. Mr. Buffon &s;uppo&s;es that the fat which falls
into the caul in our &s;heep, goes in the&s;e to furni&s;h the tail; and that
the re&s;t of the body is from thence deprived of fat in proportion. With
regard to their fleeces, in the temperate climates, they are, as in our own
breed, &s;oft and woolly; but in the warmer latitudes, they are hairy: yet in
both they pre&s;erve the enormous &s;ize of their tails.</P>
<P>The third ob&s;ervable variety is that of the &s;heep called
&s;trep&s;icheros. This animal is a native of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago,
and only differs from our &s;heep, in having &s;trait horns, &s;urrounded with
a &s;piral furrow.</P>
<P>The la&s;t variety is that of the Guinea &s;heep, which is
generally found in all the tropical cli|mates, both of Africa and the
Ea&s;t-Indies. They are of a large &s;ize, with a rough hairy &s;kin, &s;hort
horns, and ears hanging down, with a kind of dewlap under the chin. They differ
greatly in form from the re&s;t; and might be con&s;idered as animals of
another kind, were they not known to breed with other &s;heep. The&s;e, of all
the dome&s;tic kinds, &s;eem to approach the neare&s;t to the &s;tate of
nature. They are larger, &s;tronger, and &s;wifter than the common race; and,
con&s;equently, better fitted for a preca|rious fore&s;t life. However, they

<P>Such are the varieties of this animal, which have been reduced
into a &s;tate of dome&s;tic &s;er|vitude. The&s;e are all capable of producing
among each other; all the peculiarities of their form have been made by climate
and human cultivation; and none of them &s;eem &s;ufficiently independent, to
live in a &s;tate of &s;avage nature. They are, therefore, to be con&s;idered
as a de|generate race, formed by the hand of man, and propagated merely for his
benefit. At the &s;ame time, while man thus cultivates the dome&s;tic kinds, he
drives away and de&s;troys the &s;avage race, which are le&s;s beneficial, and
more head|&s;trong. The&s;e, therefore, are to be found in but a very &s;mall
number, in the mo&s;t uncul|tivated countries, where they have been able to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t by their native &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;trength. It is in the more
uncultivated parts of Greece, Sardinia, Cor&s;ica, and particularly in the
de&s;arts of Tartary, that the mufflon is to be found, that bears all the marks
of being the primitive race; and that has been actually known to breed with the
dome&s;tic animal.</P>

bears a &s;tronger &s;imilitude to the ram than to any other animal; like the
ram, it has the eyes placed near the horns; and its ears are &s;horter than
tho&s;e of the goat: it al&s;o re|&s;embles the ram in its horns, and in all
the par|ticular contours of its form. The horns al&s;o are alike; they are of a
yellow colour they have three &s;ides, as in the ram, and bend backwards in the
&s;ame manner behind the ears. The muzzle, and the in&s;ide of the ears, are of
a whiti&s;h colour, tinctured with yellow; the other parts of the face are of a
browni&s;h grey. The general co|lour of the hair over the body is of a brown,
approaching to that of the red deer. The in|&s;ide of the thighs and belly, are
of a white, tinctured with yellow. The form, upon the whole, &s;eems more made
for agility and &s;trength than that of the common &s;heep; and the moufflon is
actually found to live in a &s;avage &s;tate, and maintain it&s;elf, either by
force or &s;wiftne&s;s, again&s;t all the animals that live by rapine. Such is
its extreme &s;peed, that many have been inclined rather to rank it among the
deer kind, than the &s;heep. But in this they are deceived, as the mu&s;mon has
a mark that en|tirely di&s;tingui&s;hes it from that &s;pecies, being known
never to &s;hed its horns. In &s;ome the&s;e are &s;een to grow to a
&s;urprizing &s;ize; many of <PB N="51" REF="63"> them mea&s;uring, in their
convolutions, above two ells long. They are of a yellow colour, as was &s;aid;
but the older the animal grows, the darker the horns become: with the&s;e they
often maintain very furious battles between each other; and &s;ometimes they
are found broken off in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;mall animals of the
fore&s;t creep into the cavity for &s;helter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gmelin, as quoted by Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. When the
mu&s;mon is &s;een &s;tanding on the plain, his fore legs are always &s;trait,
while his hinder legs &s;eem bent under him; but in ca&s;es of more active
nece&s;&s;ity, this &s;eeming deformity is removed, and he moves with great
&s;wiftne&s;s and agility. The female very much re&s;embles the male of this
&s;pecies, but that &s;he is le&s;s, and her horns al&s;o are never &s;een to
grow to that prodigious &s;ize they are of in the wild ram. Such is the &s;heep
in its &s;avage &s;tate; a bold, noble, and even beautiful animal: but it is
not the mo&s;t beautiful creatures that are always found mo&s;t u&s;eful to
man. Human indu&s;try has therefore de&s;troyed its grace, to improve its
utility.</P>

<HEAD>THE GOAT, AND ITS NUMEROUS VARIETIES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome dome&s;tic animals that &s;eem as auxiliaries to
the more u&s;eful &s;orts; and, that by cea&s;ing to be the fir&s;t, are
con|&s;idered as nothing. We have &s;een the &s;ervices of the a&s;s
&s;lighted, becau&s;e inferior to tho&s;e of the hor&s;e; and, in the &s;ame
manner, tho&s;e of the goat are held cheap, becau&s;e the &s;heep &s;o far
exceeds it. Were the hor&s;e or the &s;heep removed from nature, the inferior
kinds would then be invaluable; and the &s;ame arts would probably be
be&s;towed in perfecting their kinds, that the higher order of animals have
experienced. But in their pre&s;ent neg|lected &s;tate, they vary but little
from the wild animals of the &s;ame kind; man has left them their primitive
habits and forms; and the le&s;s they owe to his a&s;&s;iduity, the more they
receive from nature.</P>
<P>The goat &s;eems, in every re&s;pect, more fitted for a life of
&s;avage liberty than the &s;heep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is naturally more lively, and more
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with animal in&s;tinct. It ea&s;ily attaches it&s;elf to man,
and &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of his care&s;&s;es. <PB N="53" REF="65"> It is al&s;o
&s;tronger and &s;wifter, more courageous, and more playful, lively,
capricious, and va|grant: it is not ea&s;ily confined to its flock, but
chu&s;es its own pa&s;tures, and loves to &s;tray re|mote from the re&s;t. It
chiefly delights in climb|ing precipices; in going to the very edge of danger:
it is often &s;een &s;u&s;pended upon an eminence hanging over the &s;ea, upon
a very little ba&s;e, and even &s;leeps there in &s;ecurity. Nature has, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, fitted it for tra|ver&s;ing the&s;e declivities with ea&s;e;
the hoof is hollow underneath, with &s;harp edges, &s;o that it walks as
&s;ecurely on the ridge of an hou&s;e, as on the level ground. It is an hardy
animal, and very ea&s;ily &s;u&s;tained; for which rea&s;on it is chiefly the
property of the poor, who have no pa&s;tures with which to &s;upply it.
Happily, however, it &s;eems better plea&s;ed with the neg|lected wild, than
the cultivated fields of art; it chu&s;es the heathy mountain, or the &s;hrubby
rock; its favourite food is the tops of the boughs, or the tender bark of young
trees: it &s;eems le&s;s afraid of immoderate heat, and bears the warm
climates, better than the &s;heep: it &s;leeps expo&s;ed to the &s;un; and
&s;eems to enjoy its warme&s;t fervours: neither is it terrified at the
&s;torm, or incommoded by the rain; immo|derate cold alone &s;eems to affect
it, and is &s;aid <PB N="54" REF="66"> to produce a vertigo, with which this
animal is &s;ometimes incommoded. The incon&s;tancy of its nature is
perceivable in the irregularity of its gait; it goes forward, &s;tops, runs,
ap|proaches, flies, merely from caprice, and with no other &s;eeming rea&s;on
than the extreme vi|vacity of its di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>There are proofs of this animal's being na|turally the friend of
man; and that the goat &s;el|dom re&s;umes its primoeval wildne&s;s, when once
reduced into a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. In the year 1698, an Engli&s;h
ve&s;&s;el happening to touch at the i&s;lands of Bonavi&s;ta, two Negroes
came, and offered the &s;ailors as many goats as they cho&s;e to take away.
Upon the captain's expre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment at this offer, the
Negroes a&s;&s;ured him that there were but twelve per&s;ons in the i&s;land,
and that the goats were mul|tiplied in &s;uch a manner as even to become a
nui&s;ance: they added, that in&s;tead of giving any trouble to catch them,
they followed the few inhabitants that were left with a &s;ort of ob&s;tinacy,
and rather became importunate with their tamene&s;s.</P>
<P>The goat produces but two at a time; and three at the mo&s;t. But
in the warmer climates, although the animal degenerates, and grows le&s;s, yet
it becomes more fruitful, being ge|nerally <PB N="55" REF="67"> found to bring
forth three, four, and five at a &s;ingle delivery. The buck is capable of
propagating at the age of one year, and the female at &s;even months; however,
the fruits of this premature generation are weak and de|fective; and their
be&s;t breeding-time is gene|rally delayed till the age of two years, or
eighteen months at lea&s;t. One buck is &s;ufficient for an hundred and fifty
goats; his appetites are exce&s;&s;ive: but this ardour brings on a &s;peedy
decay, &s;o that he is enervated in four years at mo&s;t, and even becomes old
before he reaches his &s;eventh year. The goat, like the &s;heep, continues
five months with young; and, in &s;ome places, bears twice a year.</P>
<P>The milk of the goat is &s;weet, nouri&s;hing, and medicinal; not
&s;o apt to curdle upon the &s;tomach as that of the cow; and, therefore,
preferable to tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tion is but weak. The peculiarity of this
animal's food, gives the milk a flavour different from that either of the cow
or the &s;heep; for as it generally feeds upon &s;hrubby pa&s;tures, and heathy
mountains, there is an agreeable wildne&s;s in the ta&s;te very plea&s;ing to
&s;uch as are fond of that aliment. In &s;everal parts of Ireland, and the
highlands of Scotland, the goat makes the chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
inhabitants. On tho&s;e mountains, where <PB N="56" REF="68"> no other u&s;eful
animal could find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the goat continues to glean a &s;ufficient
living; and &s;upplies the hardy natives with what they con&s;ider as varied
luxury. They lie upon beds made of their &s;kins, which are &s;oft, clean, and
whole&s;ome; they live upon their milk, with oat bread; they convert a part of
it into butter, and &s;ome into chee&s;e; the fle&s;h, indeed, they &s;eldom
ta&s;te of, as it is a delicacy which they find too expen&s;ive; however, the
kid is con|&s;idered, even by the city epicure, as a great rarity; and the
fle&s;h of the goat, when properly prepared, is ranked by &s;ome as no way
inferior to veni&s;on. In this manner, even in the wilde&s;t &s;olitudes, the
poor find comforts of which the rich do not think it worth their while to
di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s them; in the&s;e mountainous retreats, where the
land&s;cape pre&s;ents only a &s;cene of rocks, heaths, and &s;hrubs, that
&s;peak the wretched|ne&s;s of the &s;oil, the&s;e &s;imple people have their
fea&s;ts, and their plea&s;ures; their faithful flock of goats attends them to
the&s;e awful &s;olitudes, and furni&s;hes them with all the nece&s;&s;aries of
life; while their remote &s;ituation happily keeps them ignorant of greater
luxury.</P>
<P>As the&s;e animals are apt to &s;tray from the flock, no man can
attend above fifty of them at a time. They are fattened in the &s;ame 
<PB N="57" REF="69"> manner as &s;heep; but, taking every precaution, their
fle&s;h is never &s;o good or &s;o &s;weet, in our climate, as that of mutton.
It is other|wi&s;e between the tropics. The mutton there becomes flabby and
lean, while the fle&s;h of the goat rather &s;eems to improve; and in &s;ome
places the latter is cultivated in preference to the former. We, therefore,
find this animal in almo&s;t every part of the world, as it &s;eems fitted for
the nece&s;&s;ities of man in both ex|tremes. Towards the north, where the
pa&s;ture is coar&s;e and barren, the goat is fitted to find a &s;canty
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence; between the tropics, where the heat is exce&s;&s;ive, the
goat is fitted to bear the climate, and its fle&s;h is found to improve.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable varieties we find in the goat is in
that of Natolia. The Natolian goat, or, as Mr. Buffon calls it, the goat of
Angora, has the ears longer than ours, and broader in proportion. The male has
horns of about the &s;ame length with the goat of Europe, but black, and turned
very differently, going out horizontally on each &s;ide of the head, and
twi&s;ted round in the manner of a cork-&s;crew. The horns of the female are
&s;horter, and en|circle the ear &s;omewhat like tho&s;e of the ram. They are
of a dazzling white colour, and in all the hair is very long, thick, fine, and
glo&s;&s;y; <PB N="58" REF="70"> which, indeed, is the ca&s;e with almo&s;t all
the ani|mals of Syria. There are a great number of ani|mals about Angora, where
the inhabitants drive trade with their hair, which is &s;old either raw, or
manufactured into all parts of Europe. No|thing can exceed the beauty of the
&s;tuffs which are made from the hair of almo&s;t all the ani|mals of that
country. The&s;e are well known among us by the name of camlet.</P>
<P>A &s;econd variety is the A&s;&s;yrian goat of Ge&s;|ner, which is
&s;omewhat larger than ours, with ears almo&s;t hanging down to the ground, and
broad in proportion. The horns, on the con|trary, are not above two inches and
an half long, black, and bending a little backwards. The hair is of a fox
colour, and under the throat there are two excre&s;cences, like the gills of a
cock. The&s;e animals are chiefly kept round Aleppo, for the &s;ake of their
milk. They are driven through the &s;treets, and their milk is &s;old to the
inhabitants as they pa&s;s along.</P>
<P>In the third variety may be reckoned, the little goat of America,
which is of the &s;ize of a kid, but the hair is as long as that of the
or|dinary breed. The horns, which do not exceed the length of a man's finger,
are thick, and bend downwards &s;o clo&s;e to the head, that they almo&s;t
enter the &s;kin.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="71">There is an animal of this kind at the Cape of
Good Hope, called the blue goat, which may be ranked as the fourth variety. It
is in &s;hape like the dome&s;tic, but much larger, being nearly of the &s;ize
of a &s;tag. Its hair is very &s;hort, and of a delightful blue; but it lo&s;es
a great deal of its beauty when the animal is dead. It has a very long beard;
but the horns are not &s;o long in proportion as in other goats, being turned
&s;pirally, in the manner of a cork-&s;crew. It has very long legs, but well
propor|tioned; and the fle&s;h is very well ta&s;ted, but lean. For this
rea&s;on, in that plentiful country, it is chiefly killed upon account of its
&s;kin. It is a very &s;hy animal, and &s;eldom comes near the Dutch
&s;ettlements; but they are found in great abundance in the more uncultivated
parts of the country. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they are found in this exten&s;ive
region of various colours, and many of them are &s;potted beautifully, with
red, white, and brown.</P>
<P>In fine, the Juda goat re&s;embles ours in mo&s;t parts, except in
&s;ize, it being much &s;maller. This animal is common in Guinea, Angola, and
all along the coa&s;ts of Africa: it is not much larger than a hare, but it is
extremely fat, and its fle&s;h admirably ta&s;ted. It is in that country
univer&s;ally preferred to mutton.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals &s;eem all of one kind, with very 
<PB N="60" REF="72"> trifling di&s;tinctions between them. It is true that they
differ in &s;ome re&s;pects; &s;uch as having neither the &s;ame colour, hair,
ears, or horns. But it ought to be con&s;idered as a rule in natural hi&s;tory,
that neither the horns, the colour, the finene&s;s or the length of the hair,
or the po|&s;ition of the ears, are to be con&s;idered as mak|ing an actual
di&s;tinction in the kinds. The&s;e are accidental varieties, produced by
climate and food, which are known to change even in the &s;ame animal, and give
it a &s;eeming dif|ference of form. When we &s;ee the &s;hapes, the
inclinations, and the internal conformation of &s;eemingly different creatures
nearly the &s;ame; and, above all, when we &s;ee them producing among each
other, we then have no he&s;itation in pronouncing the &s;pecies, and
a&s;&s;erting that the&s;e are of the goat kind, with which they are &s;o
materially connected.</P>
<P>But, although the&s;e are evidently known to belong to the goat
kind, there are others nearly re&s;embling the goat, of who&s;e kindred we
can|not be equally certain. The&s;e are &s;uch as, being found in a &s;tate of
nature, have not as yet been &s;ufficiently &s;ubjected to human ob&s;ervation.
Hence it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine with pre|ci&s;ion to which cla&s;s they
belong; whether they be animals of a particular kind, or merely the 
<PB N="61" REF="73"> goat in its &s;tate of &s;avage freedom. Were there but
one of the&s;e wild animals, the enquiry would &s;oon be ended; and we might
readily allow it for the parent &s;tock; but, in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, there
are two kinds that have almo&s;t equal preten&s;ions to this honour; and the
claims of which it has been found difficult to deter|mine. The animals in
que&s;tion are the &s;ham|moy and the ibex. The&s;e both bear very near
approaches to the goat in figure; have horns that never &s;hed; and, at the
&s;ame time, are more different from each other than from the animal in
que&s;tion. From which of the&s;e two &s;ources our dome&s;tic goat is derived
is not ea&s;y to &s;ettle. In&s;tead, therefore, of entering into the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I will content my&s;elf with the re&s;ult of Mr. Buffon's
enquiries. He is of opinion that the ibex is the principal &s;ource, that our
dome&s;tic goat is the immediate de&s;cend|ant, and that the &s;hammoy is but a
variety from that &s;tock, a &s;ort of collateral branch of the &s;ame family.
His principal rea&s;on for giving the preference to the ibex is its having a
more ma&s;|culine figure, large horns, and a large beard; whereas the &s;hammoy
wants the&s;e marks of pri|mitive &s;trength and wildne&s;s. He &s;uppo&s;es,
therefore, in their original &s;avage &s;tate, that our goat has taken after
the male of the parent <PB N="62" REF="74"> &s;tock, and the &s;hammoy after
the female; and that this has produced a variety in the&s;e ani|mals, even
before they underwent human cul|tivation.</P>
<P>However this be, the two animals in que&s;tion &s;eem both well
fitted for their precarious life, being extremely &s;wift, and capable of
running with ea&s;e along the ledges of precipices, where even the wolf or the
fox, though in&s;tigated by hunger, dares not pur&s;ue them. They are both
natives of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the mountains of Greece; there they
propa|gate in va&s;t numbers, and continue to exi&s;t in &s;pite of the hunter
and every bea&s;t of prey that is found ince&s;&s;antly to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>The ibex re&s;embles the goat in the &s;hape of its body; but
differs in the horns, which are much larger. They are bent backward, full of
knots; and it is generally a&s;&s;erted that there is a knot added every year.
There are &s;ome of the&s;e found, if we may believe Bellonius, at lea&s;t two
yards long. The ibex has a large black beard, is of a brown colour, with a
thick warm coat of hair. There is a &s;treak of black runs along the top of the
back; and the belly and back of the thighs are of a fawn colour.</P>
<P>The &s;hammoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. Peroud's Account,
as quoted by Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, though a wild animal, is very ea&s;ily
tamed, and docile; and to be found <PB N="63" REF="75"> only in rocky and
mountainous places. It is about the &s;ize of a dome&s;tic goat, and
re|&s;embles one in many re&s;pects. It is mo&s;t agree|ably lively, and active
beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The &s;hammoy's hair is &s;hort, like that of the doe;
in &s;pring it is of an a&s;h colour, and in autumn a dun colour, inclining to
black, and in winter of a blacki&s;h brown. This animal is found in great
plenty in the mountains of Dauphiny of Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and
Germany. They are peaceful, gentle creatures, and live in &s;ociety with each
other. They are found in flocks of from four to four&s;core, and even an
hundred, di&s;per&s;ed upon the crags of the mountains. The large males are
&s;een feeding detached from the re&s;t, except in rutting time, when they
approach the females, and drive away the young. The time of their coupling is
from the beginning of November to the end of October; and they bring forth in
April and March. The young keeps with the dam for about five months, and
&s;ometimes longer, if the hunters and the wolves do not &s;eparate them. It is
a&s;&s;erted that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their fle&s;h is
good to eat; and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of &s;uet, which
far &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the goat in hardne&s;s and goodne&s;s. The 
<PB N="64" REF="76"> &s;hammoy has &s;carce any cry, as mo&s;t animals are
known to have; if it has any, it is a kind of feeble bleat, by which the parent
calls its young. But in ca&s;es of danger, and when it is to warn the re&s;t of
the flock, it u&s;es an hi&s;|&s;ing noi&s;e, which is heard at a great
di&s;tance. For it is to be ob&s;erved that this creature is ex|tremely
vigilant, and has an eye the quicke&s;t and mo&s;t piercing in nature. Its
&s;mell al&s;o is not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hing. When it &s;ees its enemy
di&s;tinctly, it &s;tops for a moment; and then, if the per&s;on be near, in an
in&s;tant after it flies off. In the &s;ame manner, by its &s;mell, it can
di&s;cover a man at half a league di&s;tance, and gives the earlie&s;t notice.
Upon any alarm, therefore, or any apprehen&s;ions of danger, the &s;hammoy
begins his hi&s;&s;ing note with &s;uch force, that the rocks and the fore&s;ts
re-echo to the &s;ound. The fir&s;t hi&s;s continues as long as the time of one
in&s;piration. In the beginning it is very &s;harp, and deeper towards the
clo&s;e. The animal having, after this fir&s;t alarm, re|po&s;ed a moment,
again looks round, and, per|ceiving the reality of its fears, continues to
hi&s;s by intervals, until it has &s;pread the alarm to a very great
di&s;tance. During this time, it &s;eems in the mo&s;t violent agitation; it
&s;trikes the ground with its fore-foot, and &s;ometimes with 
<PB N="65" REF="77"> both: it bounds from rock to rock; it turns and looks
round; it runs to the edge of the precipice; and, &s;till perceiving the enemy,
flies with all its &s;peed. The hi&s;&s;ing of the male is much louder and
&s;harper than that of the fe|male; it is performed through the no&s;e; and is
properly no more than a very &s;trong breath, driven violently through a
&s;mall apperture. The &s;hammoy feeds upon the be&s;t herbage, and chu&s;es
the mo&s;t delicate parts of the plants, the flower and the tender buds. It is
not le&s;s delicate with regard to &s;everal aromatic herbs, which grow upon
the &s;ides of the mountains. It drinks but very little while it feeds upon the
&s;ucculent herbage, and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding. This animal
is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes, which are round and &s;parkling,
and which mark the warmth of its con&s;titution. Its head is furni&s;hed with
two &s;mall horns, of about half a foot long, of a beautiful black, and
ri&s;ing from the fore|head, almo&s;t betwixt the eyes. The&s;e, con|trary to
what they are found in other animals, in&s;tead of going backwards or
&s;ideways, jet out forward, and bend a little, at their extremities, backward,
in a &s;mall circle, and end in a very &s;harp point. The ears are placed in a
very elegant manner, near the horns; and there are <PB N="66" REF="78"> two
&s;tripes of black on each &s;ide of the face, the re&s;t being of a whiti&s;h
yellow, which never changes. The horn of this animal is often u&s;ed as the
head of a cane. Tho&s;e of the female are le&s;s, and not &s;o much bent; and
&s;ome farriers are &s;een to bleed cattle with them. The&s;e ani|mals are &s;o
much incommoded by heat, that they are never found in &s;ummer, except in the
caverns of rocks, amid&s;t fragments of unmelted ice, under the &s;hade of high
and &s;preading trees, or of rough and hanging precipices, that face the north,
and which keep off entirely the rays of the &s;un. They go to pa&s;ture both
morning and evening, and &s;eldom during the heat of the day. They run along
the rocks with great ea&s;e and &s;eeming indifference, and leap from one to
another, &s;o that no dogs are able to pur&s;ue them. There is nothing more
extraordinary than to &s;ee them climbing and de&s;cending precipices, that to
all other qua|drupedes are inacce&s;&s;ible. They always mount or de&s;cend in
an oblique direction; and throw them&s;elves down a rock of thirty feet, and
light with great &s;ecurity upon &s;ome excre|&s;cence, or fragment, on the
&s;ide of the precipice, which is ju&s;t large enough to place their feet upon;
they &s;trike the rock, however, in their de&s;cent, with their feet, three or
four times, <PB N="67" REF="79"> to &s;top the velocity of their motion; and,
when they have got upon their ba&s;e below, they at once &s;eem fixed and
&s;ecure. In fact, to &s;ee them jump in this manner, they &s;eem rather to
have wings than legs; &s;ome, indeed, pretend to &s;ay that they u&s;e their
horns for climbing, but this wants confirmation. Cer|tain it is that their legs
alone are formed for this arduous employment, the hinder being ra|ther longer
than the former, and bending in &s;uch a manner that, when they de&s;cend upon
them, they break the force of the fall. It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that when
they feed, one of them always &s;tands as centinel; but how far this may be
true is que&s;tionable. For certain, while they feed, there are &s;ome of them
that keep continually gazing round the re&s;t; but this is practi&s;ed among
all gregarious animals; &s;o that when they &s;ee any danger, they warn the
re&s;t of the herd of its approach. During the rigours of winter, the &s;hammoy
&s;leeps in the thicker fore&s;ts, and feeds upon the &s;hrubs and the buds of
the pine-tree. It &s;ometimes turns up the &s;now with its foot to look for
herbage; and, where it is green, makes a delicious repa&s;t. The more craggy
and uneven the fore&s;t, the more this animal is plea&s;ed with the abode,
which thus adds to its &s;ecurity. The hunting the <PB N="68" REF="80">
&s;hammoy is very laborious and extremely dif|ficult. The mo&s;t u&s;ual way is
to hide behind the clefts of the rocks and &s;hoot them. This, however, mu&s;t
be done with great precaution; the &s;port&s;man mu&s;t creep for a va&s;t way
upon his belly, in &s;ilence, and take al&s;o the advan|tage of the wind, which
if it blow from him they would in&s;tantly perceive. When arrived at a proper
di&s;tance, he then advances his piece, which is to be rifle barrelled, and to
carry one ball, and tries his fortune among them. Some al&s;o pur&s;ue this
animal as they do the &s;tag, by placing proper per&s;ons at all the
pa&s;&s;ages of a glade, or valley, and then &s;ending in others to rou&s;e the
game. Dogs are quite u&s;ele&s;s in this chace, as they rather alarm than
overtake. Nor is it without danger even to the men; for it often happens that
when the animal finds it|&s;elf over-pre&s;&s;ed, it drives at the hunter with
its head, and often tumbles him down the neigh|bouring precipice. This animal
cannot go upon ice when &s;mooth; but if there be the lea&s;t inequalities on
its &s;urface, it then bounds along in &s;ecurity, and quickly evades all
pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the &s;hammoy was once famous, when tanned, for its
&s;oftne&s;s and warmth; at pre&s;ent, however, &s;ince the art of tanning has
been brought to greater perfection, the leather <PB N="69" REF="81"> called
&s;hammoy is made al&s;o from tho&s;e of the tame goat, the &s;heep, and the
deer. Many me|dicinal virtues al&s;o were &s;aid to re&s;ide in the blood, fat,
gall, and the concretion &s;ometimes found in the &s;tomach of this animal,
called the German bezoar. The fat, mixed with milk, was &s;aid to be good in
ulcers of the lungs. The gall was &s;aid to be u&s;eful in &s;trengthening the
&s;ight; the &s;tone, which is generally about the &s;ize of a walnut and
blacki&s;h, was formerly in great reque&s;t for having the &s;ame virtues with
oriental bezoar. However, in the pre&s;ent enlightened &s;tate of phy&s;ic, all
the&s;e medicines are quite out of repute; and, although we have the names of
&s;everal medicines procurable from quadrupedes, yet, except the mu&s;k or
harts|horn alone, I know of none in any degree of reputation. It is true, the
fat, the urine, the beak, and even the dung, of various animals, may be found
efficacious where better remedies are not to be had; but they are far
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed by by many at pre&s;ent in u&s;e, who&s;e operations we know,
and who&s;e virtues are confirmed by re|peated experience.</P>
<P>Such are the quadrupedes that more pecu|liarly belong to the goat
kind. Each of the&s;e, in all probability, can engender and breed with the
other; and were the whole race extin|gui&s;hed, <PB N="70" REF="82"> except any
two, the&s;e would be &s;uf|ficient to repleni&s;h the world, and continue the
kind. Nature, however, proceeds in her va|riations by &s;low and in&s;en&s;ible
degrees, and &s;carce draws a firm di&s;tingui&s;hed line between any two
neighbouring races of animals what|&s;oever. Thus it is hard to di&s;cover
where the &s;heep ends and the goat begins; and we &s;hall find it &s;till
harder to fix preci&s;ely the boundaries between the goat kind and the deer. In
all tran&s;itions from one kind to the other, there are to be found a middle
race of animals, that &s;eem to partake of the nature of both, and that can
preci&s;ely be referred to nei|ther. That race of quadrupedes, called the
Gazelles, are of this kind; they are properly neither goat nor deer, and yet
they have many of the marks of both; they make the &s;hade between the&s;e two
kinds, and fill up the cha&s;m in nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE GAZELLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gazelles, of which there are &s;everal kinds, can, with
propriety, be referred neither to the goat or the deer; and yet they partake of
both natures. Like the goat, they have hollow horns that never fall, which is
other|wi&s;e in the deer. They have a gall-bladder, <PB N="71" REF="83"> which
is found in the goat and not in the deer; and, like that animal, they feed
rather upon &s;hrubs than gra&s;&s;y pa&s;tures. On the other hand, they
re&s;emble the roe-buck in &s;ize and delicacy of form; they have deep pits
under the eyes like that animal; they re&s;emble the roe-buck in the colour and
nature of their hair; they re&s;emble him in the bunches upon their legs, which
only differ in being upon the fore-legs in the&s;e, and on the hind legs in the
other. They &s;eem, therefore, to be of a middle nature between the&s;e two
kinds; or, to &s;peak with greater truth and preci&s;ion, they form a
di&s;tinct kind by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of this tribe of animals, by which
they differ both from the goat and deer, are the&s;e: their horns are made
differently, being annulated or ringed round, at the &s;ame time that there are
longitudinated de|pre&s;&s;ions running from the bottom to the point. They have
bunches of hair upon their fore-legs; they have a &s;treak of black, red, or
brown, running along the lower part of their &s;ides, and three &s;treaks of
whiti&s;h hair in the internal &s;ide of the ear. The&s;e are characters that
none of them are without; be&s;ides the&s;e, there are others which, in
general, they are found to have, and which are more obvious to the be|holder. 
<PB N="72" REF="84"> Of all animals in the world, the ga|zelle has the mo&s;t
beautiful eye, extremely brilliant, and yet &s;o meek that all the ea&s;tern
poets compare the eyes of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to tho&s;e of this animal. A
gazelle-eyed beauty is con&s;idered as the highe&s;t cmpliment that a lover can
pay; and, indeed, the Greeks them&s;elves thought it no inelegant piece of
flattery to re&s;emble the eyes of a beautiful wo|man to tho&s;e of a cow. The
gazelle, for the mo&s;t part, is more delicately and finely limbed than even
the roe-buck; its hair is as &s;hort, but finer and more glo&s;&s;y. Its hinder
legs are longer than tho&s;e before, as in the hare, which gives it greater
&s;ecurity in a&s;cending or de|&s;cending &s;teep places. Their &s;wiftne&s;s
is equal, if not &s;uperior to that of the roe; but as the latter bounds
forward, &s;o the&s;e run along in an even uninterrupted cour&s;e. Mo&s;t of
them are brown upon the back, white under the belly, with a black &s;tripe,
&s;eparating the&s;e co|lours between. Their tail is of various lengths, but in
all covered with pretty long hair; and their ears are beautiful, well placed,
and ter|minating in a point. They all have a cloven hoof, like the &s;heep;
they all have permanent horns; and the female has them &s;maller than the
male.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="85">Of the&s;e animals, Mr. Buffon makes twelve
varieties; which, however, is much fewer than what other naturali&s;ts have
made them. The fir&s;t is the Gazella, properly &s;o called, which is of the
&s;ize of the roe-buck, and very much re|&s;embling it in all the proportions
of its body, but entirely differing, as was &s;aid, in the na|ture and
fa&s;hion of the horns, which are black and hollow, like tho&s;e of the ram, or
the goat, and never fall. The &s;econd he calls the Kevel, which is rather
le&s;s than the former; its eyes al&s;o &s;eem larger; and its horns, in&s;tead
of being round, are flatted on the &s;ides, as well in the male as the female.
The third he calls the Corin, which very much re&s;embles the two former, but
that it is &s;till le&s;s than either. Its horns al&s;o are &s;maller in
proportion, &s;moother than tho&s;e of the other two, and the annular
prominences belonging to the kind are &s;carce di&s;cernable, and may rather be
called wrinkles than prominences. Some of the&s;e animals are often &s;een
&s;treaked like the tiger. The&s;e three are &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the &s;ame
&s;pecies. The fourth he calls the Zeiran, the horns only of which he has
&s;een; which, from their &s;ize, and the de&s;cription of travellers, he
&s;uppo&s;es to be|long to a larger kind of the gazelle, found in India and
Per&s;ia, under that denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="86">The fifth he calls the Koba, and the &s;ixth
the kob; the&s;e two differ from each other only in &s;ize, the former being
much larger than the latter. The muzzle of the&s;e animals is much longer than
tho&s;e of the ordinary gazelle; the head is differently &s;haped, and they
have no de|pre&s;&s;ions under the eyes. The &s;eventh he calls after its
Egyptian name, the Algazel; which is &s;haped pretty much like the ordinary
gazelle, except that the horns are much longer, being generally three feet from
the point to the in|&s;ertion; whereas, in the common gazelle, they are not
above a foot; they are &s;maller al&s;o, and &s;traiter, till near the
extremities, when they turn &s;hort, with a very &s;harp flexure: they are
black and &s;mooth, and the annular prominences are &s;carcely ob&s;ervable.
The eighth is called the Pazan; or, by &s;ome, the bezoar goat, which greatly
re&s;embles the former, except a &s;mall variety in their horns; and al&s;o
with this dif|ference, that as the algazel feeds upon the plains, this is only
found in the mountains. They are both inhabitants of the &s;ame countries and
climate; being found in Egypt, Arabia, and Per&s;ia. This la&s;t is the animal
famous for that concretion in the inte&s;tines or &s;tomach, called the
Oriental Bezoar, which was once in &s;uch repute all over the world for its
medicinal <PB N="75" REF="87"> virtues. The word bezoar is &s;uppo&s;ed to take
its name either from the pazan or pazar, which is the animal that produces it;
or from a word in the Arabic language, which &s;ignifies antidote, or
counter-poi&s;on. It is a &s;tone of a glazed blacki&s;h colour, found in the
&s;tomach, or the inte&s;tines of &s;ome animal, and brought over to us from
the Ea&s;t-Indies. Like all other animal concretions, it is found to have a
kind of nu|cleous, or hard &s;ub&s;tance within, upon which the external
coatings were formed; for, upon being &s;awed through, it is &s;een to have
layer over layer, as in an onion. This nucleus is of various kinds; &s;ometimes
the buds of a &s;hrub, &s;ometimes a piece of &s;tone, and &s;ometimes a
marca&s;ite. This &s;tone is from the &s;ize of an acorn to that of a pidgeon's
egg; the larger the &s;tone, the more valuable it is held; its price
encrea&s;ing, like that of a diamond. There was a time when a &s;tone of four
ounces &s;old in Europe for above two hundred pounds; but, at pre&s;ent, the
price is greatly fallen, and they are in very little e&s;teem. The bezoar is of
va|rious colours; &s;ometimes of a blood colour, &s;ometimes of a pale yellow,
and of all the &s;hades between the&s;e two. It is generally glo&s;&s;y,
&s;mooth, and has a fragrant &s;mell, like that of ambergrea&s;e, probably
ari&s;ing from the aro|matic <PB N="76" REF="88"> vegetables upon which the
animal that produces it, feeds. It has been given in ver|tigoes, epilep&s;ies,
palpitations of the heart, cho|lic, jaundice, and, in tho&s;e places where the
dearne&s;s, and not the value of medicines, is con&s;ulted, in almo&s;t every
di&s;order incident to man. In all, perhaps, it is equally efficacious, acting
only as an ab&s;orbent powder, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing virtues equal to common
chalk, or crabs claws. Judicious phy&s;icians have therefore di&s;|carded it;
and this celebrated medicine is now chiefly con&s;umed in countries where the
know|ledge of nature has been but little advanced. When this medicine was in
its highe&s;t repu|tation, many arts were u&s;ed to adulterate it; and many
countries endeavoured to find out a bezoar of their own. Thus we had occidental
bezoar, brought from America; German be|zoar, which has been mentioned before;
cow bezoar, and monkey bezoar. In fact, there is &s;carce an animal, except of
the carnivorous kinds, that does not produce &s;ome of the&s;e con|cretions in
the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, kidnies, bladder, and even in the heart. To
the&s;e ig|norance may impute virtues that they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s;
experience has found but few cures wrought by their efficacy: but it is well
known, that they often prove fatal to the animal that <PB N="77" REF="89">
bears them. The&s;e concretions are generally found in cows, by their practice
of licking off their hair, which gathers in the &s;tomach into the &s;hape of a
ball, acquires a &s;urprizing degree of hardne&s;s, and &s;ometimes a poli&s;h
like leather. They are often as large as a goo&s;e-egg; and, when become too
large to pa&s;s, block up the pa&s;&s;age of the food, and the animal dies. The
&s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e balls, however, is different from the bezoar mentioned
above; being rather a concretion of hair than of &s;tone. There is a bezoar
found in the gall-bladder of a boar, and thence called hog bezoar, in very
great e&s;teem; but perhaps with as little ju&s;tice as any of the former. In
&s;hort, there is &s;carce an animal, or &s;carce a part of their bodies, in
which concre|tions are not formed; and it is more than pro|bable, as Mr. Buffon
ju&s;tly remarks, that the bezoar &s;o much in u&s;e formerly, was not the
production of the pazar, or any one animal only, but that of the whole gazelle
kind; who feed|ing upon odoriferous herbs and plants, gave this admirable
fragrance to the accidental con|cretions which they were found to produce. As
this medicine, however, is but little u&s;ed at pre&s;ent, our curio&s;ity is
much abated, as to the cau&s;e of its formation. To return, there|fore, to the
varieties in the gazelle tribe, the <PB N="78" REF="90"> ninth is called the
Ranguer, and is a native of Senegal. This differs &s;omewhat in &s;hape and
colour from the re&s;t; but particularly in the &s;hape of its horns, which are
&s;trait to near the points, where they crook forward, pretty much in the
&s;ame manner as in the &s;hammoy they crook backward. The tenth variety of the
gazelle is the Antelope, &s;o well known to the Engli&s;h, who have given it
the name. This animal is of the &s;ize of a roe-buck, and re&s;embles the
gazelle in many particulars, but differs in others: it has deeper eye-pits than
the former; the horns are formed differently al&s;o, being about &s;ixteen
inches long, almo&s;t touching each other at the bottom, and &s;preading as
they ri&s;e, &s;o as at their tips to be &s;ixteen inches a&s;under. They have
the annular prominences of their kind, but not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hable as in
the gazelle: however, they have a double flexure, which is very re|markable,
and &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h them from all others of their kind. At the root
they have a tuft of hair, which is longer than that of any part of the body.
Like others of the &s;ame kind, the antelope is brown on the back, and white
under the belly; but the&s;e colours are not &s;eparated by the black &s;treak
which is to be found in all the re&s;t of the gazelle kinds. There are
different &s;orts of this animal, &s;ome <PB N="79" REF="91"> with larger horns
than others, and others with le&s;s. The one which makes the eleventh va|riety
in the gazelle kind, Mr. Buffon calls the Lidme, which has very large horns;
and the other, which is the twelfth and la&s;t, he calls the Indian Antelope,
the horns of which are very &s;mall.</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added three or four varieties more, which it is
not ea&s;y to tell whether to re|fer to the goat or the gazelle, as they
equally re&s;emble both. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the Bu|balus, an animal that
&s;eems to partake of the mixed natures of the cow, the goat, and the deer. It
re&s;embles the &s;tag in the &s;ize and the figure of its body, and
particularly in the &s;hape of its legs. But it has permanent horns, like the
goat; and made entirely like tho&s;e of the gazelle kind. It al&s;o re&s;embles
that ani|mal in its way of living: however, it differs in the make of its head,
being exactly like the cow in the length of its muzzle, and in the
di&s;po&s;ition of the bones of its &s;cull; from which &s;imilitude it has
taken its name. This animal has a narrow long head; the eyes are placed very
high; the forehead &s;hort and nar|row; the horns permanent, about a foot long,
black, thick, annulated, and the rings of the gazelle kind, remarkably large;
its &s;houlders <PB N="80" REF="92"> are very high, and it has a kind of bunch
on them, that terminates at the neck; the tail is about a foot long, and tufted
with hair at the extremity. The hair of this animal is remark|able in being
thicker at the middle than at the root: in all other quadrupedes, except the
elk and this, the hair tapers off from the bottom to the point; but in the&s;e,
each hair &s;eems to &s;well in the middle, like a nine-pin. The bu|balus
al&s;o re&s;embles the elk in &s;ize, and the colour of its &s;kin; but the&s;e
are the only &s;imili|tudes between them: as the one has a very large branching
head of &s;olid horns that are an|nually deciduous, the other has black
unbranch|ing hollow horns that never fall. The bubalus is common enough in
Barbary, and has often been called by the name of the Barbary Cow, from which
animal it differs &s;o widely. It par|takes pretty much of the nature of the
antelope; like that having the hair &s;hort, the hide black, the ears pointed,
and the fle&s;h good for food.</P>
<P>The &s;econd anomalous animal of the goat-kind, Mr. Buffon calls
the Condoma. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal in &s;ize to the large&s;t &s;tag,
but with hollow horns, like tho&s;e of the goat kind, and with varied flexures,
like tho&s;e of the antelope. They are above three feet long; and, at their
extremities, about two feet <PB N="81" REF="93"> a&s;under. All along the back
there runs a white li&s;t, which ends at the in&s;ertion of the tail; another
of the &s;ame colour cro&s;&s;es this, at the bottom of the neck, which it
entirely &s;urrounds: there are two more of the &s;ame kind running round the
body, one behind the fore legs, and the other running parallel to it before the
hinder. The colour of the re&s;t of the body is greyi&s;h, except the belly,
which is white: it has al&s;o a long grey beard; and its legs, though long, are
well proportioned.</P>
<P>The third that may be mentioned, he calls the Guiba. It
re&s;embles the gazelles in every particular, except in the colour of the
belly, which, as we have &s;een, is white in them, but in this is of a deep
brown. Its horns al&s;o are not marked with annular prominences, but are
&s;mooth and poli&s;hed. It is al&s;o remarkable for white li&s;ts, on a brown
ground, that are di&s;|po&s;ed along the animal's body, as if it were covered
with a harne&s;s. Like the former, it is a native of Africa.</P>
<P>The African Wild Goat of Grimmius is the fourth. It is of a dark
a&s;h colour; and in the middle of the head is an hairy tuft, &s;tanding
upright; on both &s;ides, between the eyes and the no&s;e, there are very deep
cavities, greater than tho&s;e of the other kinds, which contain a 
<PB N="82" REF="94"> yellow oily liquor, which coagulates into a black
&s;ub&s;tance, that has a &s;mell between mu&s;k and civet. This being taken
away, the liquor again runs out, and coagulates, as before. The&s;e cavities
have no communication with the eyes, and, con&s;equently, this oozing
&s;ub&s;tance can have nothing of the nature of tears.</P>
<P>To this we may add the Chevrotin, or little Guinea Deer, which is
the lea&s;t of all cloven footed quadrupedes, and perhaps the mo&s;t beautiful;
its legs, at the &s;malle&s;t part, are not much thicker than the &s;hank of a
tobacco-pipe; it is about &s;even inches high, and about twelve from the point
of the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail. It is the mo&s;t delicately
&s;haped animal in the world, being completely formed like a &s;tag in
miniature; except that its horns, when it has any, are more of the gazelle
kind, being hollow and annulated in the &s;ame manner. It has two canine teeth
in the upper jaw; in which re&s;pect it differs from all other animals of the
goat or deer kind, and thus makes a &s;pecies entirely di&s;tinct by it&s;elf.
This wonderful animal's colour is not le&s;s plea&s;ing; the hair, which is
&s;hort and glo&s;&s;y, being in &s;ome of a beautiful yellow, except on the
neck and belly, which is white. They are natives of India, Guinea, and the warm
climates between the tropics; <PB N="83" REF="95"> and are found in great
plenty. But though they are amazingly &s;wift for their &s;ize, yet the Negroes
often overtake them in the pur&s;uit, and knock them down with their &s;ticks.
They may be ea&s;ily tamed, and then they become familiar and plea&s;ing; but
they are of &s;uch de|licate con&s;titutions, that they can bear no cli|mate
but the hotte&s;t; and they always peri&s;h with the rigours of ours, when they
are brought over. The male in Guinea has horns; the fe|male is without any; as
are all the kinds of this animal, to be found either in Java or Ceylon, where
they chiefly abound.</P>
<P>Such is the li&s;t of the gazelles; all which pretty nearly
re&s;emble the deer in form, and de|licacy of &s;hape; but have the horns
hollow, &s;ingle, and permanent, like tho&s;e of the goat. They properly fill
up, as has been already ob|&s;erved, the interval between the&s;e two kinds of
animals; &s;o that it is difficult to tell where the goat ends, and the deer
may be &s;aid to begin. If we compare the gazelles with each other, we &s;hall
find but very &s;light di&s;tinctions between them. The turn or the magnitude
of the horns, the different &s;pots on the &s;kin, or a dif|ference of &s;ize
in each, are chiefly the marks by which their varieties are to be known; but
their <PB N="84" REF="96"> way of living, their nature, and their peculiar
&s;wiftne&s;s, all come under one de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The gazelles are, in general, inhabitants of the warmer climates;
and contribute, among other embelli&s;hments, to add beauty to tho&s;e
fore&s;ts that are for ever green. They are often &s;een feeding in herds, on
the &s;ides of the moun|tain, or in the &s;hade of the woods; and fly all
together, upon the &s;malle&s;t approaches of dan|ger. They bound with &s;uch
&s;wiftne&s;s, and are &s;o very &s;hy, that dogs or men vainly attempt to
pur&s;ue them. They traver&s;e tho&s;e pre|cipices with ea&s;e and &s;afety,
which to every quadrupede el&s;e are quite impracticable; nor can any animals,
but of the winged kind, over|take them. Accordingly, in all tho&s;e countries
where they are chiefly found, they are pur&s;ued by falcons; and this admirable
manner of hunting makes one of the principal amu&s;ements of the upper ranks of
people all over the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Arabians, Per&s;ians, and Turks, breed up for this purpo&s;e,
that kind of hawk called the Falcon Gentle, with which, when properly trained,
they go forth on hor&s;eback among the fore&s;ts and the mountains, the falcon
perching upon the hand of the hunter. Their expedition is conducted with
profound &s;ilence; their dogs are taught to hang behind; while the men, on 
<PB N="85" REF="97"> the fleete&s;t cour&s;ers, look round for the game.
Whenever they &s;py a gazelle at the proper di&s;tance, they point the falcon
to its object, and encourage it to pur&s;ue. The falcon, with the &s;wiftne&s;s
of an arrow, flies to the animal; that, knowing its danger, endeavours, but too
late, to e&s;cape. The falcon &s;oon coming up with its prey, fixes its talons,
one into the ani|mal's cheek, the other into its throat, and deeply wounds it.
On the other hand, the ga|zelle attempts to e&s;cape, but is generally wounded
too deeply to run far. The falcon clings with the utmo&s;t per&s;everance, nor
ever leaves its prey till it falls; upon which the hunters from behind
approaching, take up both, and reward the falcon with the blood of the &s;poil.
They al&s;o teach the young ones, by applying them to the dead animal's throat,
and accu&s;tom|ing them betimes to fix upon that particular part; for if it
&s;hould happen that the falcon fixed upon any other part of the gazelle,
either its back or its haunches, the animal would ea&s;ily e&s;cape among the
mountains, and the hunter would al&s;o lo&s;e his falcon.</P>
<P>They &s;ometimes al&s;o hunt the&s;e animals with the ounce. This
carnivorous and fierce crea|ture being made tame and dome&s;tic, generally 
<PB N="86" REF="98"> &s;its on hor&s;eback behind the hunter, and re|mains
there with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, until the gazelle is &s;hewn; it is then
that it exerts all its arts and fiercene&s;s; it does not at once fly at its
prey, but approaches &s;lyly, turning and winding about until it comes within
the proper di&s;tance, when all at once it bounds upon the heedle&s;s animal,
and in&s;tantly kills it, and &s;ucks its blood. If, on the other hand, it
mi&s;&s;es its aim, it re&s;ts in the place, without at|tempting to pur&s;ue
any farther, but &s;eems a&s;hamed of its own inability.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another way of taking the ga|zelle, which &s;eems
not &s;o certain, nor &s;o amu&s;ing as either of the former. A tame gazelle is
bred up for this purpo&s;e, who is taught to join tho&s;e of its kind, wherever
it perceives them. When the hunter, therefore, perceives a herd of the&s;e
together, he fixes a noo&s;e round the horns of the tame gazelle, in &s;uch a
manner, that if the re&s;t but touch it, they are entangled; and thus pre|pared
he &s;ends his gazelle among the re&s;t. The tame animal no &s;ooner
approaches, but the males of the herd in&s;tantly &s;ally forth to oppo&s;e
him; and, in butting with their horns, are caught in the noo&s;e. In this, both

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Mu&s;k Animal.</HEAD>
<P>THE more we &s;earch into nature, the more we &s;hall find how
little &s;he is known; and we &s;hall more than once have occa&s;ion to find,
that protracted enquiry is more apt to teach us mo|de&s;ty, than to produce
information. Although the number and nature of quadrupedes at fir&s;t glance
&s;eems very little known; yet, when we come to examine clo&s;er, we find
&s;ome with which we are very partially acquainted, and others that are utterly
unknown. There is &s;carce a cabinet of the curious but what has the &s;poils
of animals, or the horns or the hoofs of qua|drupedes, which do not come within
former de&s;criptions. There is &s;carce a per&s;on who&s;e trade is to dre&s;s
or improve furs, but knows &s;everal creatures by their &s;kins, which no
naturali&s;t has hitherto had notice of. But of all quadrupedes, there is none
&s;o ju&s;tly the reproach of natural hi&s;torians, as that which bears the
mu&s;k. This perfume, &s;o well known to the elegant, and &s;o very u&s;eful in
the hands of the phy&s;ician, a medicine that has for more than a century been
imported from the ea&s;t in great quantities, and during all that time has 
<PB N="89" REF="101"> been improving in its reputation, is, neverthe|le&s;s,
&s;o very little under&s;tood, that it remains a doubt whether the animal that
produces it be an hog, an ox, a goat, or a deer. When an animal with which we
are &s;o nearly connected, is &s;o utterly unknown, how little mu&s;t we know
of many that are more remote and un&s;erviceable! Yet naturali&s;ts proceed in
the &s;ame train, en|larging their catalogues and their names, with|out
endeavouring to find out the nature, and fix the preci&s;e hi&s;tory of tho&s;e
with which we are very partially acquainted. It is the &s;pirit of the
&s;cholars of the pre&s;ent age, to be fonder of encrea&s;ing the bulk of our
knowledge than its utility; of extending their conque&s;ts than of improving
their empire.</P>
<P>The mu&s;k which comes to Europe, is brought over in &s;mall bags,
about the &s;ize of a pidgeon's egg, which, when cut open, appear to contain a
kind of du&s;ky reddi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, like coa|gulated blood, and which, in
large quantities, has a very &s;trong &s;mell; but when mixed and diffu&s;ed,
becomes a very agreeable perfume. Indeed, no &s;ub&s;tance now known in the
world has a &s;tronger or a more permanent &s;mell. A grain of mu&s;k perfumes
a whole room; and its odour continues for &s;ome days, without dimi|nution. But
in a larger quantity it continues <PB N="90" REF="102"> for years together; and
&s;eems &s;carce wa&s;ted in its weight, although it has filled the
atmo&s;phere to a great di&s;tance with its parts. It is par|ticularly u&s;ed
in medicine, in nervous and hy|&s;teric di&s;orders; and is found, in &s;uch
ca&s;es, to be the mo&s;t powerful remedy now in u&s;e: how|ever, the animal
that furni&s;hes this admirable medicine, has been very variou&s;ly
de&s;cribed, and is known but very imperfectly.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription given of this animal by Grew, is as follows. The
Mu&s;k animal is pro|perly neither of the goat nor deer kind, for it has no
horns, and it is uncertain whether it ru|minates or not; however, it wants the
fore teeth in the upper jaw, in the &s;ame manner as in ruminating animals;
but, at the &s;ame time, it has tu&s;ks like tho&s;e of a hog. It is three feet
&s;ix inches in length, from the head to the tail; and the head is above half a
foot long. The fore part of the head is like that of a grey|hound; and the ears
are three inches long, and erect, like tho&s;e of a rabbit; but the tail is not
above two inches. It is cloven footed, like bea&s;ts of the goat kind; the hair
on the head and legs is half an inch long, on the belly an inch and an half,
and on the back and buttocks three inches; and proportionably thicker than in
any other animal. It is brown and white <PB REF="103">

</FIGURE> <PB N="91" REF="104">alternately, from the root to the
point; on the head and thighs it is brown, but under the belly and tail white,
and a little curled, e&s;pe|cially on the back and belly. On each &s;ide of the
lower jaw, under the corners of the mouth, there is a tuft of thick hair, which
is &s;hort and hard, and about three quarters of an inch long. The hair, in
general, of this ani|mal, is remarkable for its &s;oftne&s;s and fine tex|ture;
but what di&s;tingui&s;hes it particularly are the tu&s;ks, which are an inch
and an half long, and turn back in the form of an hook; and more particularly
the bag which contains the mu&s;k, which is three inches long, two broad, and
&s;tands out from the belly an inch and an half. It is a very fearful animal,
and, there|fore, it has long ears; and the &s;en&s;e of hearing is &s;o quick,
that it can di&s;cover an enemy at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>After &s;o long and circum&s;tantial a de&s;cription of this animal,
its nature is but very little known; nor has any anatomi&s;t as yet examined
its internal &s;tructure; or been able to inform us whether it be a ruminant
animal, or one of the hog kind; how the mu&s;k is formed, or whether tho&s;e
bags in which it comes to us be really be|longing to the animal, or are only
the &s;ophi&s;ti|cations of the venders. Indeed, when we con|&s;ider 
<PB REF="105"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="91" REF="106"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="92" REF="107"> the immen&s;e quantities of this &s;ub&s;tance which are
con&s;umed in Europe alone, not to mention the ea&s;t, where it is in &s;till
greater re|pute than here, we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that any one animal can
furni&s;h the &s;upply; and parti|cularly when it mu&s;t be killed before the
bag can be obtained. We are told, it is true, that the mu&s;k is often
depo&s;ited by the animal upon trees and &s;tones, again&s;t which it rubs
it&s;elf when the quantity becomes unea&s;y; but it is not in that form which
we receive it, but al|ways in what &s;eems to be its own natural blad|der. Of
the&s;e, Taverner brought home near two thou&s;and in one year; and as the
animal is wild, &s;o many mu&s;t, during that &s;pace, have been hunted and
taken. But as the creature is repre&s;ented very &s;hy, and as it is found but
in &s;ome particular provinces of the ea&s;t, the wonder is how its bag
&s;hould be &s;o cheap, and furni&s;hed in &s;uch great plenty. The bag in
common does not co&s;t (if I do not forget) above a crown by retail, and yet
this is &s;uppo&s;ed the only one belonging to the animal; and for the
obtaining of which, it mu&s;t have been hunted and killed. The only way of
&s;olving this difficulty, is to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e bags are, in a great
mea&s;ure, counterfeit, taken from &s;ome other animal, or from &s;ome part of
the &s;ame, <PB N="93" REF="108"> filled with its blood, and a very little of
the perfume, but enough to impregnate the re&s;t with a &s;trong and permanent
odour. It comes to us from different parts of the ea&s;t; from China, Tunquin,
Bengal, and often from Mu&s;|covy: that of Thibet is reckoned the be&s;t, and
&s;ells for fourteen &s;hillings an ounce; that of Mu&s;covy the wor&s;t, and
&s;ells but for three; the odour of this, though very &s;trong at fir&s;t,
being quickly found to evaporate.</P>
<P>Mu&s;k was &s;ome years ago in the highe&s;t re|que&s;t as a
perfume, and but little regarded as a medicine; but at pre&s;ent its reputation
is to|tally changed; and having been found of great benefit in phy&s;ic, it is
but little regarded for the purpo&s;es of elegance. It is thus that things
which become nece&s;&s;ary, cea&s;e to continue plea&s;ing; and the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their u&s;e, de&s;troys their power of admini&s;tering
delight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Animals of the Deer Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IF we compare the &s;tag and the bull as to &s;hape and form, no two
animals can be more unlike; and yet, if we examine their internal &s;tructure,
we &s;hall find a &s;triking &s;imilitude between them. Indeed, their
differences, except to a nice ob|&s;erver, will &s;carcely be perceivable. All
of the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are formed differently;
their &s;pleen is al&s;o pro|portionably larger; their tail is &s;horter; and
their horns, which are &s;olid, are renewed every year. Such are the &s;light
internal di&s;crimina|tions between two animals, one of which is among the
&s;wifte&s;t, and the other the heavie&s;t of the brute creation.</P>
<P>The Stag is one of tho&s;e innocent and peace|able animals that
&s;eems made to embelli&s;h the fore&s;t, and animate the &s;olitudes of
nature. The ea&s;y elegance of his form, the lightne&s;s of his motions,
tho&s;e large branches that &s;eem made rather for the ornament of his head
than its de|fence, the &s;ize, the &s;trength and the &s;wiftne&s;s of this
beautiful creature, all &s;ufficiently rank him among the fir&s;t of
quadrupedes, among the mo&s;t noted objects of human curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="110">The Stag, or Hart, who&s;e female is called a
<HI>hind,</HI> and the young a <HI>calf,</HI> differs in &s;ize and in horns
from a fallow-deer. He is much larger, and his horns are round; whereas in the
fallow kind they are broad and palmated. By the&s;e the animal's age is known.
The fir&s;t year, the &s;tag has no horns, but an horny excre&s;cence, which is
&s;hort, rough, and covered with a thin hairy &s;kin. The next year the horns
are &s;ingle and &s;traight; the third year they have two antlers, three the
fourth, four the fifth, and five the &s;ixth; this number is not always
cer|tain, for &s;ometimes there are more, and often le&s;s. When arrived at the
&s;ixth year, the ant|lers do not always encrea&s;e; and, although the number
may amount to &s;ix or &s;even on each &s;ide, yet the animal's age is then
e&s;timated ra|ther from the &s;ize of the antlers and the thick|ne&s;s of the
branch which &s;u&s;tains them, than from their variety.</P>
<P>The&s;e horns, large as they &s;eem, are, not|with&s;tanding, &s;hed
every year, and new ones come in their place. The old horns are of a firm
&s;olid texture, and u&s;ually employed in making handles for knives and other
dome&s;tic uten&s;ils. But, while young, nothing can be more &s;oft or tender;
and the animal, as if con|&s;cious of his own imbecility, at tho&s;e times,
in|&s;tantly <PB N="96" REF="111"> upon &s;hedding his former horns, retires
from the re&s;t of his fellows, and hides him&s;elf in &s;olitudes and
thickets, never venturing out to pa&s;ture, except by night. During this time,
which mo&s;t u&s;ually happens in the &s;pring, the new horns are very painful,
and have a quick &s;en&s;ibility of any external impre&s;&s;ion. The flies
al&s;o are extremely trouble&s;ome to him. When the old horn is fallen off, the
new does not be|gin immediately to appear; but the bones of the &s;kull are
&s;een covered only with a tran&s;pa|rent perio&s;teum, or &s;kin, which, as
anatomi&s;ts teach us, covers the bones of all animals. Af|ter a &s;hort time,
however, this &s;kin begins to &s;well, and to form a &s;oft tumour, which
con|tains a great deal of blood, and which begins to be covered with a downy
&s;ub&s;tance that has the feel of velvet, and appears nearly of the &s;ame
colour with the re&s;t of the animal's hair. This tumour every day buds forward
from the point like the graft of a tree; and, ri&s;ing by degrees from the
head, &s;hoots out the antlers on either &s;ide, &s;o that in a few days, in
pro|portion as the animal is in condition, the whole head is completed.
However, as was &s;aid above, in the beginning, its con&s;i&s;tence is very
&s;oft, and has a &s;ort of bark, which is no more than a continuation of the
integument of <PB N="97" REF="112"> the &s;kull. It is velveted and downy, and
every where furni&s;hed with blood-ve&s;&s;els, that &s;upply the growing horns
with nouri&s;hment. As they creep along the &s;ides of the branches, the print
is marked over the whole &s;urface; and the larger the blood-ve&s;&s;els, the
deeper the&s;e marks are found to be; from hence ari&s;es the inequa|lity of
the &s;urface of the deer's horns; which, as we &s;ee, are furrowed all along
the &s;ides, the impre&s;&s;ions dimini&s;hing towards the point, where the
&s;ub&s;tance is as &s;mooth and as &s;olid as ivory. But it ought to be
ob&s;erved, that this &s;ub&s;tance, of which the horns is compo&s;ed, begins
to harden at the bottom while the upper part re|mains &s;oft and &s;till
continues growing; from whence it appears that the horns grow diffe|rently in
deer from tho&s;e of &s;heep or cows; in which they are always &s;een to
encrea&s;e from the bottom. However, when the whole head has received its full
growth, the extremities then begin to acquire their &s;olidity; the velvet
co|vering, or bark, with its blood-ve&s;&s;els, dry up, and then begin to fall;
and this the animal ha&s;tens, by rubbing its antlers again&s;t every tree it
meets. In this manner, the whole external &s;urface being &s;tripped off by
degrees, at length the whole head acquires its complete hardne&s;s,
expan&s;ion, and beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="113">It would be a vain ta&s;k to enquire into the
cau&s;e of the animal production of the&s;e horns; it is &s;ufficient to
ob&s;erve, that if a &s;tag is ca|&s;tated when its horns are fallen off, they
will never grow again; and, on the contrary, if the &s;ame operation is
performed when they are on, they will never fall off. If only one of his
te&s;ticles are taken out, he will want the horn on that &s;ide; if one of the
te&s;ticles only be tied up he will want the horn of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. The
encrea&s;e of their provi&s;ion al&s;o tends to fa|cilitate the growth and the
expan&s;ion of the horns; and Mr. Buffon thinks it po&s;&s;ible to re|tard
their growth entirely by greatly retrench|ing their food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xi. p. 113.</BIBL></NOTE>. As a proof of this,
nothing can be more obvious than the difference be|tween a &s;tag bred in
fertile pa&s;tures and un|di&s;turbed by the hunter, and one often pur&s;ued
and ill nouri&s;hed. The former has his head expanded, his antlers numerous,
and the branches thick; the latter has but few antlers, the traces of the
blood-ve&s;&s;els upon them are but &s;light, and the expan&s;ion but little.
The beauty and &s;ize of their horns, therefore, mark their &s;trength and
their vigour; &s;uch of them as are &s;ickly, or have been wounded, never
&s;hooting out that magnificent profu&s;ion &s;o much <PB N="99" REF="114">
admired in this animal. Thus the horns may, in every re&s;pect, be re&s;embled
to a vegetable &s;ub&s;tance, grafted upon the head of an animal. Like a
vegetable they grow from the extremi|ties; like a vegetable they are for a
while co|vered with a bark that nouri&s;hes them; like a vegetable they have
their annual production and decay; and a &s;trong imagination might &s;uppo&s;e
that the leafy productions on which the animal feeds, go once more to vegetate
in his horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Buffon has &s;uppo&s;ed &s;omething
like this. 
<BIBL>Vid. Pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;tag is u&s;ually a twelvemonth old before the horns begin to
appear, and then a &s;ingle branch is all that is &s;een for the year
en&s;uing. About the beginning of &s;pring, all of this kind are &s;een to
&s;hed their horns, which fall off of them&s;elves; though &s;ometimes the
animal a&s;|&s;i&s;ts the efforts of nature, by rubbing them again&s;t a tree.
It &s;eldom happens that the branches on both &s;ides fall off at the &s;ame
time, there often being two or three days between the dropping of the one and
the other. The old &s;tags u&s;ually &s;hed their horns fir&s;t; which
gene|rally happens towards the latter end of Fe|bruary, or the beginning of
March. Tho&s;e of the &s;econd head, (namely, &s;uch as are between 
<PB N="100" REF="115"> five and &s;ix years old) &s;hed their horns about the
middle or latter end of March; tho&s;e &s;till younger, in the month of April;
and the younge&s;t of all, not till the middle, or the latter end of May; they
generally &s;hed them in pools of water, whither they retire from the heat; and
this has given ri&s;e to the opinion of their always hiding their horns.
The&s;e rules, though true in general, are yet &s;ubject to many varia|tions;
and univer&s;ally it is known that a &s;evere winter retards the &s;hedding of
the horns.</P>
<P>The horns of the &s;tag generally encrea&s;e in thickne&s;s and in
height from the &s;econd year of its age to the eighth. In this &s;tate of
perfection they continue during the vigour of life; but as the animal grows old
the horns feel the impre&s;|&s;ions of age, and &s;hrink like the re&s;t of the
body. No branch bears more than twenty or twenty-two antlers even in the
highe&s;t &s;tate of vigour; and the number is &s;ubject to great va|riety; for
it happens that the &s;tag at one year has either le&s;s or more than the year
preceding, in proportion to the goodne&s;s of his pa&s;ture, or the continuance
of his &s;ecurity, as the&s;e animals &s;eldom thrive when often rouzed by the
hun|ters. The horns are al&s;o found to partake of the nature of the &s;oil; in
the more fertile pa|&s;tures they are large and tender; on the con|trary, 
<PB N="101" REF="116"> in the barren &s;oil they are hard, &s;tunted, and
brittle.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;tags have &s;hed their horns, they &s;eparate
from each other, and &s;eek the plainer parts of the country, remote from every
other animal, which they are utterly unable to oppo&s;e. They then walk with
their heads &s;tooping down, to keep their horns from &s;trik|ing again&s;t the
branches of the trees above. In this &s;tate of imbecility they continue near
three months before their heads have acquired their full growth and &s;olidity;
and then, by rubbing them again&s;t the branches of every thicket, they at
length clear them of the &s;kin which had contributed to their growth and
nouri&s;hment. It is &s;aid by &s;ome that the horn takes the colour of the
&s;ap of the tree again&s;t which it is rubbed; and that &s;ome thus become
red, when rubbed again&s;t the heath; and others brown, by rubbing again&s;t
the oak; this, how|ever, is a mi&s;take, &s;ince &s;tags kept in parks where
there are no trees, have a variety in the colour of their horns, which can be
a&s;cribed to nothing but nature.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after they have furni&s;hed their horns, they begin
to feel the impre&s;&s;ions of the rut, or the de&s;ire of copulation. The old
ones are the mo&s;t forward; and about the end of <PB N="102" REF="117">
Augu&s;t, or the beginning of September, they quit their thickets, and return
to the mountain in order to &s;eek the hind to whom they call with a loud
tremulous note. At this time their neck is &s;wolen; they appear bold and
furious; fly from country to country; &s;trike with their horns again&s;t the
trees and ob&s;tacles, and con|tinue re&s;tle&s;s and fierce until they have
found the female; who at fir&s;t flies from them, but is at la&s;t compelled
and overtaken. When two &s;tags contend for the &s;ame female, how timor|ous
&s;oever they may appear at other times, they then &s;eem agitated with an
uncommon degree of ardour. They paw up the earth, menace each other with their
horns, bellow with all their force, and &s;triking in a de&s;pe|rate manner
again&s;t each other, &s;eem deter|mined upon death or victory. This combat
continues till one of them is defeated or flies; and it often happens that the
victor is obliged to fight &s;everal of tho&s;e battles before it re|mains
undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the field. The old ones are generally the conquerors
upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, as they have more &s;trength and greater courage; and
the&s;e al&s;o are pre|ferred by the hind it&s;elf to the young ones, as the
latter are more feeble, and le&s;s ardent. However, they are all equally
incon&s;tant, keep|ing <PB N="103" REF="118"> to the female but a few days, and
then &s;eeking out for another not to be enjoyed, perhaps, without a repetition
of their former danger.</P>
<P>In this manner the &s;tag continues to range from one to the other
for about three weeks, the time the rut continues; during which he &s;carce
eats, &s;leeps, or re&s;ts, but continues to pur&s;ue, to combat, and to enjoy.
At the end of this period of madne&s;s, for &s;uch in this ani|mal it &s;eems
to be, the creature that was be|fore fat, &s;leek, and glo&s;&s;y, becomes
lean, feeble, and timid. He then retires from the herd to &s;eek plenty and
repo&s;e; he frequents the &s;ide of the fore&s;t, and chu&s;es the mo&s;t
nouri&s;hing pa&s;tures, remaining there till his &s;trength is renewed. Thus
is his whole life pa&s;&s;ed in the alternations of plenty and want, of
corpulence and inanition, of health and &s;ickne&s;s, without having his
con&s;titution much affected by the violence of the change. As he is above five
years coming to perfection, he lives about forty years; and it is a general
rule, that every ani|mal lives about &s;even or eight times the num|ber of
years which it continues to grow. What, therefore, is reported concerning the
life of this animal, has ari&s;en from the credulity of ignorance: &s;ome
&s;ay, that a &s;tag having been <PB N="104" REF="119"> taken in France, with a
collar, on which were written the&s;e words, 
<Q REND="inline">"Cae&s;ar hoc me donavit;"</Q> this was interpreted
of Julius Cae&s;ar; but it is not con&s;idered that Cae&s;ar is a general name
for kings, and that one of the Emperors of Germany, who are always &s;tiled
Cae&s;ars, might have ordered the in&s;cription.</P>
<P>This animal may differ in the term of his life according to the
goodne&s;s of his pa&s;ture, or the undi&s;turbed repo&s;e he happens to enjoy.
The&s;e are advantages that influence not only his age, but his &s;ize and his
vigour. The &s;tags of the plains, the vallies, and the little hills, which
abound in corn and pa&s;ture, are much more corpulent and much taller than
&s;uch as are bred on the rocky wa&s;te, or the heathy mountain. The latter are
low, &s;mall, and meagre, incapable of going &s;o &s;wift as the former,
although they are found to hold out much longer. They are al&s;o more artful in
evading the hunters; their horns are generally black and &s;hort, while tho&s;e
of the lowland &s;tags are reddi&s;h and flouri&s;hing; &s;o that the animal
&s;eems to encrea&s;e in beauty and &s;tature in proportion to the goodne&s;s
of the pa&s;ture, which he enjoys in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual colour of the &s;tag in England is red; neverthele&s;s,
the greater number in other <PB N="105" REF="120"> countries are brown. There
are &s;ome few that are white; but the&s;e &s;eem to have obtained this colour
in a former &s;tate of dome&s;tic tame|ne&s;s. Of all the animals that are
natives of this climate, there are none that have &s;uch a beautiful eye as the
&s;tag: it is &s;parkling, &s;oft, and &s;en&s;ible. His &s;en&s;es of
&s;melling and hear|ing are in no le&s;s perfection. When he is in the lea&s;t
alarmed, he lifts the head and erects the ears, &s;tanding for a few minutes as
if in a li&s;tening po&s;ture. Whenever he ventures upon &s;ome unknown ground,
or quits his native co|vering, he fir&s;t &s;tops at the &s;kirt of the plain
to examine all around; he next turns again&s;t the wind to examine by the
&s;mell if there be any enemy approaching. If a per&s;on &s;hould happen to
whi&s;tle or call out, at a di&s;tance, the &s;tag is &s;een to &s;top &s;hort
in his &s;low mea|&s;ured pace, and gazes upon the &s;tranger with a kind of
aukward admiration: if the cunning animal perceives neither dogs nor fire-arms
preparing again&s;t him, he goes forward, quite unconcerned, and &s;lowly
proceeds without of|fering to fly. Man is not the enemy he is mo&s;t afraid of;
on the contrary, he &s;eems to be de|lighted with the &s;ound of the
&s;hepherd's pipe; and the hunters &s;ometimes make u&s;e of that in|&s;trument
to allure the poor animal to his de|&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="121">The &s;tag eats &s;lowly, and is very delicate
in the choice of his pa&s;ture. When he has eaten a &s;ufficiency, he then
retires to the covert of &s;ome thicket to chew the cud in &s;ecurity. His
rumination, however, &s;eems performed with much greater difficulty than with
the cow or &s;heep; for the gra&s;s is not returned from the fir&s;t &s;tomach
without much &s;training, and a kind of hiccup, which is ea&s;ily perceived
during the whole time it continues. This may proceed from the greater length of
his neck and the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age, all tho&s;e of the cow and
the &s;heep kind having it much wider.</P>
<P>This animal's voice is much &s;tronger, louder, and more tremulous
in proportion as he ad|vances in age; in the time of rut it is even ter|rible.
At that &s;ea&s;on he &s;eems &s;o tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion that nothing
ob&s;tructs his fury; and, when at bay, he keeps the dogs off with great
intrepidity. Some years ago, the Duke of Cumberland cau&s;ed a tiger and a
&s;tag to be enclo&s;ed in the &s;ame area; and the &s;tag made &s;o bold a
defence, that the tiger was at la&s;t obliged to fly. The &s;tag &s;eldom
drinks in the winter, and &s;till le&s;s in the &s;pring, while the plants are
tender and covered over with dew. It is in the heat of the &s;ummer, and during
the time of rut, that he is &s;een con&s;tantly fre|quenting 
<PB N="107" REF="122"> the &s;ide of rivers and lakes, as well to &s;lake his
thir&s;t as to cool his ardour. He &s;wims with great ea&s;e and &s;trength,
and be&s;t at tho&s;e times when he is fatte&s;t, his fat keeping him buoyant,
like oil upon the &s;urface of the water. During the time of rut he even
ven|tures out to &s;ea, and &s;wims from one i&s;land to another, although
there may be &s;ome leagues di&s;tance between them.</P>
<P>The cry of the hind, or female, is not &s;o loud as that of the
male, and is never excited but by apprehen&s;ion for her&s;elf or her young. It
need &s;carce be mentioned that &s;he has no horns, or that &s;he is more
feeble and unfit for hunting than the male. When once they have conceived, they
&s;eparate from the males, and then they both herd together apart. The time of
ge&s;tation continues between eight and nine months, and they generally produce
but one at a time. Their u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on for bringing forth is about the
month of May, or the be|ginning of June, during which they take great care to
hide their young in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure thickets. Nor is this precaution
without rea|&s;on, &s;ince almo&s;t every creature is then a for|midable enemy.
The eagle, the falcon, the o&s;prey, the wolf, the dog, and all the rapa|cious
family of the cat kind, are in continual <PB N="108" REF="123"> employment to
find out her retreat. But, what is more unnatural &s;till, the &s;tag him&s;elf
is a pro|fe&s;&s;ed enemy, and &s;he is obliged to u&s;e all her arts to
conceal her young from him as from the mo&s;t dangerous of her pur&s;uers. At
this &s;ea|&s;on, therefore, the courage of the male &s;eems transferred to the
female; &s;he defends her young again&s;t her le&s;s formidable opponents by
force; and when pur&s;ued by the hunter, &s;he ever offers her&s;elf to
mi&s;lead him from the prin|cipal object of her concern. She flies before the
hounds for half the day, and then returns to her young, who&s;e life &s;he has
thus pre&s;erved at the hazard of her own. The calf, for &s;o the young of this
animal is called, never quits the dam during the whole &s;ummer; and in winter,
the hind, and all the males under a year old, keep together, and a&s;&s;emble
in herds, which are more numerous in proportion as the &s;ea&s;on is more
&s;evere. In the &s;pring they &s;e|parate; the hinds to bring forth, while
none but the year olds remain together; however, the&s;e animals are in general
fond of herding and grazing in company; it is danger or nece&s;|&s;ity alone
that &s;eparates them.</P>
<P>The dangers they have to fear from other animals, are nothing when
compared to tho&s;e from man. The men of every age and nation 
<PB N="109" REF="124"> have made the chace of the &s;tag one of their mo&s;t
favourite pur&s;uits; and tho&s;e who fir&s;t hunted from nece&s;&s;ity, have
continued it for amu&s;ement. In our own country, in particular, hunting was
ever e&s;teemed as one of the prin|cipal diver&s;ions of the great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. At fir&s;t, indeed, the
bea&s;ts of chace had the whole i&s;land for their range, and knew no other
limits than tho&s;e of the ocean.</P>
<P>The Roman juri&s;prudence, which was formed on the manners of the
fir&s;t ages, e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a law, that, as the natural right of things
which have no ma&s;ter belongs to the fir&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, wild
bea&s;ts, birds, and fi&s;hes, are the property of who&s;oever could fir&s;t
take them. But the northern barbarians, who over-ran the Roman empire, bringing
with them the &s;tronge&s;t reli&s;h for this amu&s;ement, and, being now
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more ea&s;y means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the lands they
had conquered, their chiefs and leaders began to appropriate the right of
hunting, and, in&s;tead of a natural right, to make it a royal one. When the
Saxon kings, therefore, had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves into an heptarchy, the
chaces were re&s;erved by each &s;overeign for his own particular amu&s;ement.
Hunting and war, in tho&s;e uncivilized ages, <PB N="110" REF="125"> were the
only employment of the great. Their active, but uncultivated, minds were
&s;u&s;ceptible of no plea&s;ures but tho&s;e of a violent kind, &s;uch as gave
exerci&s;e to their bodies, and prevented the unea&s;ine&s;s of thinking. But
as the Saxon kings only appropriated tho&s;e lands to the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the
chace which were unoccupied be|fore, &s;o no individuals received any injury.
But it was otherwi&s;e when the Norman kings were &s;ettled upon the throne.
The pa&s;&s;ion for hunting was then carried to an exce&s;s, and every civil
right was involved in general ruin. This ardour for hunting was &s;tronger than
the con|&s;ideration of religion even in a &s;uper&s;titious age. The village
communities, nay, even the mo&s;t &s;acred edifices, were thrown down, and all
turned into one va&s;t wa&s;te, to make room for animals, the objects of a
lawle&s;s tyrant's plea|&s;ure. Sanguinary laws were enacted to pre&s;erve the
game; and, in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry the Fir&s;t, it was le&s;s
criminal to de|&s;troy one of the human &s;pecies than a bea&s;t of chace. Thus
it continued while the Norman line filled the throne; but when the Saxon line
was re&s;tored, under Henry the Second, the rigour of the fore&s;t laws were
&s;oftened. The barons al&s;o for a long time imitated the encroachments, as
well as the amu&s;ements, of the monarch; but <PB N="111" REF="126"> when
property became more happily divided, by the introduction of arts and
indu&s;try, the&s;e exten&s;ive hunting grounds became more li|mited; and as
tillage and hu&s;bandry encrea&s;ed, the bea&s;ts of chace were obliged to give
way to others more u&s;eful to community. Tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of land, before
dedicated to hunting, were then contracted; and, in proportion as the u&s;eful
arts gained ground, they protected and encouraged the labours of the
indu&s;trious, and repre&s;&s;ed the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;port&s;|man.
It is, therefore, among the &s;ubjects of a de|&s;potic government only that
the&s;e laws remain in full force, where large wa&s;tes lie uncultivated for
the purpo&s;es of hunting, where the hu&s;|bandman can find no protection from
the in|va&s;ions of his lord, or the continual depreda|tions of tho&s;e animals
which he makes the ob|jects of his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent cultivated &s;tate of this country, therefore, the
&s;tag is unknown in its wild na|tural &s;tate; and &s;uch of them as remain
among us are kept, under the name of red deer, in parks among the fallow deer.
But they are become le&s;s common than formerly; its exce&s;|&s;ive
viciou&s;ne&s;s, during the rutting &s;ea&s;on, and the badne&s;s of its
fle&s;h, inducing mo&s;t people to part with the &s;pecies. The few that
&s;till re|main <PB N="112" REF="127"> wild are to be found on the moors that
border on Cornwall and Devon&s;hire; and in Ireland, on mo&s;t of the large
mountains of that country.</P>
<P>In England, the hunting the &s;tag and the buck are performed in the
&s;ame manner; the animal is driven from &s;ome gentleman's park, and then
hunted through the open country. But tho&s;e who pur&s;ue the wild animal, have
a much higher object, as well as a greater va|riety in the chace. To let
loo&s;e a creature that was already in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in order to
catch it again, is, in my opinion, but a poor pur|&s;uit, as the reward when
obtained is only what we before had given away. But to pur&s;ue an animal that
owns no proprietor, and which he that fir&s;t &s;eizes may be &s;aid to
po&s;&s;e&s;s, has &s;ome|thing in it that &s;eems at lea&s;t more rational;
this rewards the hunter for his toil, and &s;eems to repay his indu&s;try.
Be&s;ides, the &s;uperior &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;s of the wild animal
pro|longs the amu&s;ement; it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more various arts to
e&s;cape the hunter, and leads him to precipices where the danger ennobles the
chace. In pur&s;uing the animal let loo&s;e from a park, as it is unu&s;ed to
danger, it is but little ver&s;ed in the &s;tratagems of e&s;cape; the hunter
follows as &s;ure of overcoming, and feels none <PB N="113" REF="128"> of
tho&s;e alternations of hope and fear which ari&s;e from the uncertainty of
&s;ucce&s;s. But it is otherwi&s;e with the mountain &s;tag: having &s;pent his
whole life in a &s;tate of continual apprehen|&s;ion; having frequently been
followed, and as frequently e&s;caped, he knows every trick to mi&s;lead, to
confound, or intimidate his pur|&s;uers; to &s;timulate their ardour, and
enhance their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who hunt this animal have their pecu|liar terms for the
different objects of their pur|&s;uit. The profe&s;&s;ors in every art take a
plea&s;ure in thus employing a language known only to them&s;elves, and thus
accumulate words which to the ignorant have the appearance of know|ledge. In
this manner, the &s;tag is called the fir&s;t year, a <HI>calf,</HI> or
<HI>hind calf</HI>; the &s;econd year, a <HI>knobber</HI>; the third, a
<HI>brock</HI>; the fourth, a <HI>&s;taggard</HI>; the fifth, a
<HI>&s;tag</HI>; the &s;ixth, an <HI>hart.</HI> The female is called an
<HI>hind</HI>; the fir&s;t year &s;he is a <HI>calf</HI>; the &s;econd, a
<HI>hear&s;e</HI>; the third, a <HI>hind.</HI> This animal is &s;aid to
<HI>harbour</HI> in the place where he re&s;ides. When he cries he is &s;aid to
<HI>bell</HI>; the print of his hoof is called the <HI>&s;lot</HI>; his tail is
called the <HI>&s;ingle</HI>; his excrement the <HI>few|met</HI>; his horns are
called his <HI>head:</HI> when &s;imple, the fir&s;t year, they are called
<HI>broches</HI>; the third year, <HI>&s;pears</HI>; the fourth year, that part
<PB N="114" REF="129"> which bears the antlers is called the <HI>beam,</HI> and
the little impre&s;&s;ions upon its &s;urface <HI>glitters</HI>; that which
ri&s;e from the cru&s;t of the <HI>beam</HI> are called <HI>pearls.</HI> The
antlers al&s;o have di&s;tinct names: the fir&s;t that branches off is called
the <HI>antler</HI>; the &s;econd the <HI>&s;ur antler</HI>; all the re&s;t
which grow afterwards, till you come to the top, which is called the
<HI>crown,</HI> are called <HI>royal antlers.</HI> The little buds about the
tops are called <HI>croches.</HI> The impre&s;&s;ion on the place where the
&s;tag has lain, is called the <HI>layer.</HI> If it be in covert or a thicket,
it is called his <HI>har|bour.</HI> Where a deer has pa&s;&s;ed into a thicket,
leaving marks whereby his bulk may be gue&s;&s;ed, it is called an
<HI>entry.</HI> When they ca&s;t their heads, they are &s;aid to <HI>mew.</HI>
When they rub their heads again&s;t trees, to bring off the peel of their
horns, they are &s;aid to <HI>fray.</HI> When a &s;tag hard hunted takes to
&s;wimming in the water, he is &s;aid to <HI>go &s;ail</HI>; when he turns his
head again&s;t the hounds, he is &s;aid to <HI>bay</HI>; and when the hounds
pur&s;ue upon the &s;cent, until they have unharboured the &s;tag, they are
&s;aid to <HI>draw on the &s;lot.</HI></P>
<P>Such are but a few of the many terms u&s;ed by hunters in pur&s;uing
of the &s;tag, mo&s;t of which are now laid a&s;ide, or in u&s;e only among
game-keepers. The chace, however, is con|tinued <PB N="115" REF="130"> in many
parts of the country where the red deer is &s;till pre&s;erved, and &s;till
makes the amu&s;ement of &s;uch as have not found out more liberal
entertainments. In tho&s;e few places where the animal is perfectly wild, the
amu&s;e|ment, as was &s;aid above, is &s;till &s;uperior. The fir&s;t great
care of the hunter, when he leads out his hounds to the mountain &s;ide, where
the deer are generally known to harbour, is to make choice of a proper &s;tag
to pur&s;ue. His am|bition is to unharbour the large&s;t and the bolde&s;t of
the whole herd; and for this purpo&s;e he examines the track, if there be any,
which if he finds long and large, he concludes, that it mu&s;t have belonged to
a &s;tag, and not an hind, the print of who&s;e foot is rounder. Tho&s;e marks
al&s;o which he leaves on trees, by the rubbing of his horns, &s;hew his
&s;ize, and point him out as the proper object of pur&s;uit. Now to &s;eek out
a &s;tag in his haunt, it is to be ob|&s;erved, that he changes his manner of
feeding every month. From the conclu&s;ion of rutting-time, which is November,
he feeds in heaths and broomy places. In December they herd together, and
withdraw into the &s;trength of the fore&s;ts, to &s;helter them&s;elves from
the &s;everer weather, feeding on holm, elder trees, and brambles. The three
following months they <PB N="116" REF="131"> leave herding, but keep four or
five in a com|pany, and venture out to the corners of the fore&s;t, where they
feed on winter pa&s;ture, &s;ome|times making their incur&s;ions into the
neigh|bouring corn-fields, to feed upon the tender &s;hoots, ju&s;t as they
peep above ground. In April and May they re&s;t in thickets and &s;hady places,
and &s;eldom venture forth, unle&s;s rouzed by approaching danger. In September
and October their annual ardour returns; and then they leave the thickets,
boldly facing every danger, without any certain place for food or harbour.
When, by a knowledge of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, the hunter has found out the
re&s;i|dence, and the quality of his game, his next care is to uncouple and
ca&s;t off his hounds in the pur&s;uit: the&s;e no &s;ooner perceive the
ti|morous animal that flies before them, but they altogether open in full cry,
pur&s;uing rather by the &s;cent than the view, encouraging each other to
continue the chace, and tracing the flying animal with the mo&s;t amazing
&s;agacity. The hunters al&s;o are not le&s;s ardent in their &s;peed on
hor&s;eback, cheering up the dogs, and direct|ing them where to pur&s;ue. On
the other hand, the &s;tag, when unharboured, flies at fir&s;t with the
&s;wiftne&s;s of the wind, leaving his pur&s;uers &s;everal miles in the rear;
and at length having <PB N="117" REF="132"> gained his former coverts, and no
longer hearing the cries of the dogs and men that he had ju&s;t left behind, he
&s;tops, gazes round him, and &s;eems to recover his natural tranquility. But
this calm is of &s;hort duration, for his inveterate pur|&s;uers &s;lowly and
&s;ecurely trace him along, and he once more hears the approaching
de&s;truction from behind. He again, therefore, renews his efforts to e&s;cape,
and again leaves the pur&s;uers at almo&s;t the former di&s;tance; but this
&s;econd effort makes him more feeble than before, and when they come up a
&s;econd time, he is unable to out&s;trip them with equal velocity. The poor
animal now, therefore, is obliged to have recour&s;e to all his little arts of
e&s;cape, which &s;ometimes, though but &s;eldom, avail him. In proportion as
his &s;trength fails him, the ardour of his pur|&s;uers is enflamed; he tracks
more heavily on the ground, and this encrea&s;ing the &s;trength of the
&s;cent, redoubles the cries of the hounds, and enforces their &s;peed. It is
then that the &s;tag &s;eeks for refuge among the herd, and tries every
artifice to put off &s;ome other head for his own. Sometimes he will &s;end
forth &s;ome little deer in his &s;tead, in the mean time lying clo&s;e
him&s;elf, that the hounds may over&s;hoot him. He will break into one thicket
after another to find deer, rouzing them, gathering <PB N="118" REF="133"> them
together, and endeavouring to put them upon the tracks he has made. His old
com|panions, however, with a true &s;pirit of ingra|titude, now all for&s;ake
and &s;hun him with the mo&s;t watchful indu&s;try, leaving the unhappy
creature to take his fate by him&s;elf. Thus abandoned of his fellows, he again
tries other arts, by doubling and cro&s;&s;ing in &s;ome hard beaten highway,
where the &s;cent is lea&s;t per|ceivable. He now al&s;o runs again&s;t the
wind, not only to cool him&s;elf, but the better to hear the voice, and judge
of the di&s;tance of his im|placable pur&s;uers. It is now ea&s;ily perceivable
how &s;orely he is pre&s;&s;ed, by his manner of running, which from the
bounding ea&s;y pace with which he begun, is converted into a &s;tiff and
&s;hort manner of going; his mouth al&s;o is black and dry, without foam on it;
his tongue hangs out; and the tears, as &s;ome &s;ay, are &s;een &s;tarting
from his eyes. His la&s;t refuge, when every other method of &s;afety has
failed him, is to take the water, and to attempt an e&s;cape by cro&s;&s;ing
whatever lake or river he happens to approach. While &s;wimming, he takes all
po&s;&s;ible care to keep in the middle of the &s;tream, le&s;t, by touching
the bough of a tree, or the herbage on the banks, he may give &s;cent to the
hounds. He is al&s;o ever found to &s;wim <PB N="119" REF="134"> again&s;t the
&s;tream; whence the hunt&s;men have made it into a kind of proverb, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>That he that would his chace find, mu&s;t up
with the river and down with the wind.</HI></Q> On this occa&s;ion too he will
often cover him&s;elf under water, &s;o as to &s;hew nothing but the tip of his
no&s;e. Every re&s;ource, and every art being at length ex|hau&s;ted, the poor
creature tries the la&s;t remains of his &s;trength, by boldly oppo&s;ing
tho&s;e ene|mies he cannot e&s;cape; he therefore faces the dogs and men,
threatens with his horns, guards him&s;elf on every &s;ide, and for &s;ome time
&s;tands at bay. In this manner, quite de&s;perate, he furiou&s;ly aims at the
fir&s;t dog or man that ap|proaches; and it often happens that he does not die
unrevenged. At that time, the more pru|dent, both of the dogs and men, &s;eem
willing to avoid him; but the whole pack quickly coming up, he is &s;oon
&s;urrounded and brought down, and the hunt&s;man winds a <HI>treble mort,</HI>
as it is called, with his horn.</P>
<P>Such is the manner of pur&s;uing this animal in England; but every
country has a peculiar method of its own, adapted either to the nature of the
climate, or the face of the &s;oil. The ancient manner was very different from
that practi&s;ed at pre&s;ent; they u&s;ed their dogs only to find out the
game, but not to rouze it. <PB N="120" REF="135"> Hence they were not curious
as to the mu&s;ic of their hounds, or the compo&s;ition of their pack; the dog
that opened before he had di&s;|covered his game, was held in no e&s;timation.
It was their u&s;ual manner &s;ilently to find out the animal's retreat, and
&s;urround it with nets and engines, then to drive him up with all their cries,
and thus force him into the toils which they had previou&s;ly prepared.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding times the fa&s;hion &s;eemed to alter; and
particularly in Sicily, the manner of hunting was as follows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pier. Hieroglyph. lib. vii. cap. vi.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
nobles and gentry being informed which way an herd of deer pa&s;&s;ed, gave
notice to one another, and appointed a day of hunting. For this purpo&s;e,
every one was to bring a cro&s;s-bow, or a long bow, and a bundle of &s;taves,
&s;hod with iron, the heads bored, with a cord pa&s;&s;ing through them all.
Thus provided they came to where the herd continued grazing, and ca&s;ting
them|&s;elves about in a large ring, &s;urrounded the deer on every &s;ide.
Then each taking his &s;tand, unbound his faggot, &s;et up his &s;take, and
tied the end of the cord to that of his next neighbour, at the di&s;tance of
about ten feet one from the other. Between each of the&s;e &s;takes was hung a
bunch of crim&s;on feathers, and &s;o <PB N="121" REF="136"> di&s;po&s;ed, that
with the lea&s;t breath of wind they would whirl round, and pre&s;erve a &s;ort
of fluttering motion. This done, the per&s;ons who &s;et up the &s;taves
withdrew, and hid them&s;elves in the neighbouring coverts: then the chief
hunt&s;man, entering with his hounds within the lines, rouzed the game with a
full cry. The deer, frighted, and flying on all &s;ides, upon ap|proaching the
lines, were &s;cared away by the fluttering of the feathers, and wandered about
within this artificial paling, &s;till awed by the &s;hining and fluttering
plumage that encircled their retreat: the hunt&s;man, however, &s;till
pur|&s;uing, and calling every per&s;on by name, as he pa&s;&s;ed by their
&s;tand, commanded him to &s;hoot the fir&s;t, third, or &s;ixth, as he
plea&s;ed; and if any of them mi&s;&s;ed, or &s;ingled out another than that
a&s;&s;igned him, it was con&s;idered as a mo&s;t &s;hameful mi&s;chance. In
this manner, however, the whole herd was at la&s;t de&s;troyed; and the day
concluded with mirth and fea&s;ting.</P>
<P>The &s;tags of China are of a particular kind, for they are no
taller than a common hou&s;e|dog; and hunting them is one of the principal
diver&s;ions of the great. Their fle&s;h, while young, is exceedingly good; but
when they ar|rive at maturity, it begins to grow hard and tough: however, the
tongue, the muzzle, and <PB N="122" REF="137"> the ears, are in particular
e&s;teem among that luxurious people. Their manner of taking them is &s;ingular
enough: they carry with them the heads of &s;ome of the females &s;tuffed, and
learn exactly to imitate their cry; upon this the male does not fail to appear,
and looking on all &s;ides, perceives the head, which is all that the hunter,
who is him&s;elf concealed, di&s;|covers. Upon their nearer approach, the whole
company ri&s;e, &s;urround, and often take him alive.</P>
<P>There are very few varieties in the red deer of this country; and
they are mo&s;tly found of the &s;ame &s;ize and colour. But it is otherwi&s;e
in different parts of the world, where they are &s;een to differ in form, in
&s;ize, in horns, and in colour.</P>
<P>The &s;tag of Cor&s;ica is a very &s;mall animal, being not above
half the &s;ize of tho&s;e common among us. His body is &s;hort and thick, his
legs &s;hort, and his hair of a dark brown.</P>
<P>There is in the fore&s;ts of Germany, a kind of &s;tag, named by the
ancients the Tragelaphus, and which the natives call the Bran Deer, or the
Brown Deer. This is of a darker colour than the common &s;tag, of a lighter
&s;hade upon the belly, long hair upon the neck and throat, by which it appears
bearded, like the goat.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="138">There is al&s;o a very beautiful &s;tag, which
by &s;ome is &s;aid to be a native of Sardinia; but others (among whom is Mr.
Buffon) are of opinion that it comes from Africa or the Ea&s;t Indies. He calls
it the Axis, after Pliny; and con&s;iders it as making the &s;hade between the
&s;tag and the fallow deer. The horns of the axis are round, like tho&s;e of
the &s;tag; but the form of its body entirely re&s;embles that of the buck, and
the &s;ize al&s;o is exactly the &s;ame. The hair is of four colours; namely,
fallow, white, black, and grey. The white is predo|minant under the belly, on
the in&s;ide of the thighs, and the legs. Along the back there are two rows of
&s;pots in a right line; but tho&s;e on other parts of the body are very
irregular. A white line runs along each &s;ide of this ani|mal, while the head
and neck are grey. The tail is black above, and white beneath; and the hair
upon it is &s;ix inches long.</P>
<P>Although there are but few individuals of the deer kind, yet the
race &s;eems diffu&s;ed over all parts of the earth. The new continent of
America, in which neither the &s;heep, the goat, nor the gazelle, have been
originally bred, ne|verthele&s;s produces &s;tags, and other animals of the
deer kind, in &s;ufficient plenty. The Mexi|cans have a breed of white &s;tags
in their <PB N="124" REF="139"> parks, which they call Stags Royal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p. 35.</BIBL></NOTE>. The &s;tags of
Canada differ from ours in nothing except the &s;ize of the horns, which in
them is greater; and the direction of the antlers, which rather turn back, than
project forward, as in tho&s;e of Europe. The &s;ame difference of &s;ize that
ob|tains among our &s;tags, is al&s;o to be &s;een in that country; and, as we
are informed by Ruy&s;ch, the Americans have brought them into the &s;ame
&s;tate of dome&s;tic tamene&s;s that we have our &s;heep, goats, or black
cattle. They &s;end them forth in the day-time to feed in the fore&s;ts; and at
night they return home with the herd&s;man who guards them. The inhabitants
have no other milk but what the hind pro|duces; and u&s;e no other chee&s;e but
what is made from thence. In this manner we find, that an animal which &s;eems
made only for man's amu&s;ement, may be ea&s;ily brought to &s;upply his
nece&s;&s;ities. Nature has many &s;tores of happine&s;s and plenty in
re&s;erve, which only want the call of indu&s;try to be produced, and now
remain as candidates for human appro|bation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="125" REF="140">
<HEAD>THE FALLOW DEER.</HEAD>
<P>NO two animals can be more nearly allied than the &s;tag and the
fallow deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</BIBL></NOTE>. Alike in form, alike in di&s;po&s;ition, in the &s;uperb
fur|niture of their heads, in their &s;wiftne&s;s and timidity; and yet no two
animals keep more di&s;tinct, or avoid each other with more fixed animo&s;ity.
They are never &s;een to herd in the &s;ame place, they never engender
together, or form a mixed breed; and even in tho&s;e coun|tries where the
&s;tag is common, the buck &s;eems to be entirely a &s;tranger. In &s;hort,
they both form di&s;tinct families; which, though &s;o &s;eem|ingly near, are
&s;till remote; and although with the &s;ame habitudes, yet retain an
unal|terable aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fallow deer, as they are much &s;maller, &s;o they &s;eem of a
nature le&s;s robu&s;t, and le&s;s &s;avage than tho&s;e of the &s;tag kind.
They are found but rarely wild in the fore&s;ts; they are, in general, bred up
in parks, and kept for the purpo&s;es of hunting, or of luxury, their fle&s;h
being preferred to that of any other animal. It need &s;carce be mentioned,
that the horns of the buck make its principal di&s;tinction, being broad and
palmated; whereas tho&s;e of the &s;tag <PB N="126" REF="141"> are in every
part round. In the one, they are flatted and &s;pread like the palm of the
hand; in the other they grow like a tree, every branch being of the &s;hape of
the &s;tem that bears it. The fallow deer al&s;o has the tail longer, and the
hair lighter than the &s;tag; in other re|&s;pects, they pretty nearly
re&s;emble one another.</P>
<P>The head of the buck, as of all other ani|mals of this kind, is
&s;hed every year, and takes the u&s;ual time for repairing. The only
differ|ence between it and the &s;tag is, that this change happens later in the
buck; and its rut|ting-time, con&s;equently, falls more into the winter. It is
not found &s;o furious at this &s;ea&s;on as the former; nor does it &s;o much
ex|hau&s;t it&s;elf by the violence of its ardour. It does not quit its natural
pa&s;tures in que&s;t of the female, nor does it attack other animals with
indi&s;criminate ferocity: however, the males combat for the female among each
other; and it is not without many conte&s;ts, that one buck is &s;een to become
ma&s;ter of the whole herd.</P>
<P>It often happens al&s;o, that an herd of fallow deer is &s;een to
divide into two parties, and en|gage each other with great ardour and
ob|&s;tinacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
36.</BIBL></NOTE>. They both &s;eem de&s;irous of gaining &s;ome favourite
&s;pot of the park for pa&s;ture, <PB N="127" REF="142"> and of driving the
vanqui&s;hed party into the coar&s;er and more di&s;agreeable parts. Each of
the&s;e factions has its particular chief; namely, the two olde&s;t and
&s;tronge&s;t of the herd. The&s;e lead on to the engagement; and the re&s;t
follow under their direction. The&s;e combats are &s;in|gular enough, from the
di&s;po&s;ition and conduct which &s;eems to regulate their mutual efforts.
They attack with order, and &s;upport the a&s;&s;ault with courage; they come
to each other's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they retire, they rally, and never give up
the victory upon a &s;ingle defeat. The combat is renewed for &s;everal days
together; until at length the mo&s;t feeble &s;ide is obliged to give way, and
is content to e&s;cape to the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the park, where
only they can find &s;afety and protection.</P>
<P>The fallow deer is ea&s;ily tamed, and feeds upon many things
which the &s;tag refu&s;es. By this means it pre&s;erves its veni&s;on better;
and even after rutting, it does not appear entirely exhau&s;ted. It continues
almo&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tate through the whole year, although there are
particular &s;ea&s;ons when its fle&s;h is chiefly in e&s;teem. This animal
al&s;o browzes clo&s;er than the &s;tag; for which rea&s;on it is more
pre|judicial among young trees, which it often &s;trips too clo&s;e for
recovery. The young deer <PB N="128" REF="143"> eat much fa&s;ter and more
greedily than the old; they &s;eek the female at their &s;econd year, and, like
the &s;tag, are fond of variety. The doe goes with young above eight months,
like the hind; and commonly brings forth one at a time: but they differ in
this, that the buck comes to perfection at three, and lives till &s;ix|teen;
whereas the &s;tag does not come to per|fection till &s;even, and lives till
forty.</P>
<P>As this animal is a bea&s;t of chace, like the &s;tag, &s;o the
hunters have invented a number of names relative to him. The buck is the
fir&s;t year called a <HI>fawn</HI>; the &s;econd, a <HI>pricket</HI>; the
third, a <HI>&s;orel</HI>; the fourth, a <HI>&s;ore</HI>; the fifth, a <HI>buck
of the fir&s;t head</HI>; and the &s;ixth, a <HI>great buck</HI>: The female is
called a <HI>doe</HI>; the fir&s;t year a <HI>fawn</HI>; and the &s;econd a
<HI>tegg.</HI> The manner of hunting the buck is pretty much the &s;ame as that
of &s;tag hunting, except that le&s;s &s;kill is re|quired in the latter. The
buck is more ea&s;ily rouzed; it is &s;ufficient to judge by the view, and mark
what grove or covert it enters, as it is not known to wander far from thence;
nor, like the &s;tag, to change his <HI>layer,</HI> or place of repo&s;e. When
hard hunted, it takes to &s;ome &s;trong hold or covert with which it is
ac|quainted, in the more gloomy parts of the wood, or the &s;teeps of the
mountain; not like <PB N="129" REF="144"> the &s;tag, flying far before the
hounds, nor cro&s;&s;ing nor doubling, nor u&s;ing any of the &s;ubtleties
which the &s;tag is accu&s;tomed to. It will take the water when &s;orely
pre&s;&s;ed, but &s;eldom a great river; nor can it &s;wim &s;o long, nor &s;o
&s;wiftly, as the former. In general, the &s;trength, the cunning, and the
courage of this animal, are inferior to tho&s;e of the &s;tag; and,
con&s;equently, it affords neither &s;o long, &s;o va|rious, nor &s;o
ob&s;tinate a chace: be&s;ides, being lighter, and not tracking &s;o deeply, it
leaves a le&s;s powerful and la&s;ting &s;cent, and the dogs in the pur&s;uit
are more frequently at a fault.</P>
<P>As the buck is a more delicate animal than the &s;tag, &s;o al&s;o
is it &s;ubject to greater varieties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h
Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>. We have in England two varieties of the fallow-deer,
which are &s;aid to be of foreign origin. The beautiful &s;potted kind, which
is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought from Bengal; and the very deep brown
&s;ort, that are now &s;o common in &s;everal parts of this kingdom. The&s;e
were introduced by king James the Fir&s;t, from Nor|way: for having ob&s;erved
their hardine&s;s, and that they could endure the winter, even in that &s;evere
climate, without fodder, he brought over &s;ome of them into Scotland, and
di&s;po&s;ed of them among his chaces. Since that time, they have 
<PB N="130" REF="145"> multiplied in many parts of the Briti&s;h em|pire; and
England is now become more fa|mous for its veni&s;on, than any other country in
the world. Whatever pains the French have taken to rival us in this particular,
the fle&s;h of their fallow-deer, of which they keep but a few, has neither the
fatne&s;s nor the flavour of that fed upon Engli&s;h pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>However, there is &s;carce a country in Europe, except far to the
northward, in which this ani|mal is a &s;tranger. The Spani&s;h fallow-deer are
as large as &s;tags, but of a darker colour, and a more &s;lender neck: their
tails are longer than tho&s;e of ours, they are black above, and white below.
The Virginian deer are larger and &s;tronger than ours, with great necks, and
their colour inclinable to grey. Other kinds have the hoofs of their hind legs
marked out|wardly with a white &s;pot; and their ears and tails much longer
than the common. One of the&s;e has been &s;een full of white &s;pots, with a
black li&s;t down the middle of his back. In Guiana, a country of South
America, according to Labat, there are deer without horns, which are much
le&s;s than tho&s;e of Europe, but re|&s;embling them in every other
particular. They are very lively, light of cour&s;e, and exce&s;&s;ively
fearful; their hair is of a reddi&s;h &s;allow, their <PB N="131" REF="146">
heads are &s;mall and lean, their ears little, their necks long and arched, the
tail &s;hort, and the &s;ight piercing. When pur&s;ued, they fly into places
where no other animal can follow them. The Negroes, who pur&s;ue them, &s;tand
to watch for them in narrow paths, which lead to the brook or the meadow where
they feed; there waiting in the utmo&s;t &s;ilence, for the &s;lighte&s;t
&s;ound will drive them away, the Negroe, when he perceives the animal within
reach, &s;hoots, and is happy if he can bring down his game. Their fle&s;h,
though &s;eldom fat, is con&s;idered as a great delicacy, and the hunter is
well rewarded for his trouble.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ROE-BUCK.</HEAD>
<P>THE Roe-buck is the &s;malle&s;t of the deer kind known in our
climate, and is now almo&s;t extinct among us, except in &s;ome parts of the
highlands of Scotland. It is generally about three feet long, and about two
feet high. The horns are from eight to nine inches long, up|right, round, and
divided into only three branches. The body is covered with very long hair, well
adapted to the rigour of its mountainous abode. The lower part of each hair is
a&s;h colour; near the ends is a narrow <PB N="132" REF="147"> bar of black,
and the points are yellow. The hairs on the face are black, tipped with a&s;h
colour. The ears are long, their in&s;ides of a pale yellow, and covered with
long hair. The &s;paces bordering on the eyes and mouth, are black. The
che&s;t, belly, and legs, and the in|&s;ide of the thighs, are of a yellowi&s;h
white; the rump is of a pure white, and the tail very &s;hort. The make of this
little animal is very elegant; and its &s;wiftne&s;s equals its beauty. It
differs from the fallow-deer, in having round horns, and not flatted like
theirs. It differs from the &s;tag, in its &s;maller &s;ize, and the
pro|portionable paucity of its antlers: and it differs from all of the goat
kind, as it annually &s;heds its head, and obtains a new one, which none of
that kind are ever &s;een to do.</P>
<P>As the &s;tag frequents the thicke&s;t fore&s;ts, and the &s;ides
of the highe&s;t mountains, the roe|buck, with humbler ambition, courts the
&s;hady thicket, and the ri&s;ing &s;lope. Although le&s;s in &s;ize, and far
inferior in &s;trength to the &s;tag, it is yet more beautiful, more active,
and even more courageous. Its hair is always &s;mooth, clean, and glo&s;&s;y;
and it frequents only the drye&s;t places, and of the pure&s;t air. Though but
a very little animal, as we have already ob&s;erved, yet, when its young is
attacked, it <PB N="133" REF="148"> faces even the &s;tag him&s;elf, and often
comes off victorious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p.
75.</BIBL></NOTE>. All its motions are elegant and ea&s;y; it bounds without
effort, and con|tinues the cour&s;e with but little fatigue. It is al&s;o
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more cunning in avoiding the hunter, is more difficult to
pur&s;ue, and, al|though its &s;cent is much &s;tronger than that of the
&s;tag, it is more frequently found to make good a retreat. It is not with the
roe-buck, as with the &s;tag, who never offers to u&s;e art until his
&s;trength is beginning to decline; this more cunning animal, when it finds
that its fir&s;t efforts to e&s;cape are without &s;ucce&s;s, re|turns upon its
former track, again goes for|ward, and again returns, until by its various
windings it has entirely confounded the &s;cent, and joined the la&s;t
emanations to tho&s;e of its former cour&s;e. It then, by a bound, goes to one
&s;ide, lies flat upon its belly, and permits the pack to pa&s;s by very near,
without offering to &s;tir.</P>
<P>But the roe-buck differs not only from the &s;tag in &s;uperior
cunning, but al&s;o in its natural appetites, its inclinations, and its whole
habits of living. In&s;tead of herding together, the&s;e animals live in
&s;eparate families; the &s;ire, the dam, and the young ones, a&s;&s;ociate
together, <PB N="134" REF="149"> and never admit a &s;tranger into their little
com|munity. All others of the deer kind are in|con&s;tant in their affection;
but the roe-buck never leaves its mate; and as they have been generally bred up
together, from their fir&s;t fawning, they conceive &s;o &s;trong an
attach|ment, the male for the female, that they never after &s;eparate. Their
rutting-&s;ea&s;on continues but fifteen days; from the latter end of October,
to about the middle of November. They are not at that time, like the &s;tag,
overloaded with fat; they have not that &s;trong odour, which is perceived in
all others of the deer kind; they have none of tho&s;e furious exce&s;&s;es;
nothing, in &s;hort, that alters their &s;tate: they only drive away their
fawns upon the&s;e occa&s;ions; the buck forcing them to retire, in order to
make room for a &s;ucceeding progeny: however, when the copulating &s;ea&s;on
is over, the fawns return to their does, and remain with them &s;ome time
longer; after which, they quit them entirely, in order to begin an independant
family of their own. The female goes with young but five months and an half;
which alone &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h this animal from all others of the deer
kind, that continue pregnant more than eight. In this re&s;pect, &s;he rather
approaches more nearly to the goat kind; from which, <PB N="135" REF="150">
however, this race is &s;eparated by the male's annual ca&s;ting its horns.</P>
<P>When the female is ready to bring forth &s;he &s;eeks a retreat in
the thicke&s;t part of the woods, being not le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of the buck,
from whom &s;he then &s;eparates, than of the wolf, the wild cat, and almo&s;t
every ravening animal of the fore&s;t; &s;he generally produces two at a time,
and three but very rarely. In about ten or twelve days the&s;e are able to
follow their dam, except in ca&s;es of warm pur&s;uit, when their &s;trength is
not equal to the fatigue. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, the tenderne&s;s of the dam
is very extraordinary; leaving them in the deepe&s;t thickets, &s;he offers
her&s;elf to the danger, flies before the hounds, and does all in her power to
lead them from the retreat where &s;he has lodged her little ones. Such animals
as are nearly upon her own level &s;he boldly encoun|ters; attacks the &s;tag,
the wild cat, and even the wolf; and while &s;he has life continues her efforts
to protect her young. Yet all her en|deavours are often vain; about the month
of May, which is her fawning time, there is a greater de&s;truction among
tho&s;e animals than at any other &s;ea&s;on of the year. Numbers of the fawns
are taken alive by the pea&s;ants; num|bers are found out, and worried by the
dogs; <PB N="136" REF="151"> and &s;till more by the wolf, which has always
been their mo&s;t inveterate enemy. By the&s;e continual depredations upon this
beautiful creature, the roe-buck is every day becoming &s;carcer; and the whole
race in many countries is wholly worn out. They were once common in England;
the hunt&s;men, who characteri&s;ed only &s;uch bea&s;ts as they knew, have
given names to the different kinds and ages, as to the &s;tag: thus they called
it the fir&s;t year an <HI>hind</HI>; the &s;econd, a <HI>gyrle</HI>; and the
third, an <HI>hemu&s;e</HI>; but the&s;e names at pre&s;ent are utterly
u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince the animal no longer exi&s;ts among us. Even in France,
where it was once ex|tremely common, it is now confined to a few provinces; and
it is probable that in an age or two the whole breed will be utterly
extirpated. Mr. Buffon, indeed, ob&s;erves, that in tho&s;e di&s;tricts where
it is mo&s;tly found, it &s;eems to maintain its u&s;ual plenty, and that the
balance between its de&s;truction and encrea&s;e is held pretty even; however,
the number in general is known to decrea&s;e; for wherever cultivation takes
place, the bea&s;ts of nature are known to retire. Many animals that once
flouri&s;hed in the world may now be extinct; and the de&s;crip|tions of
Ari&s;totle and Pliny, though taken from life, may be con&s;idered as fabulous,
as their archetypes are no longer exi&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="152">The fawns continue to follow the deer eight
or nine months in all; and upon &s;eparating, their horns begin to appear,
&s;imple and without antlers the fir&s;t year, as in tho&s;e of the &s;tag
kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xii. p. 88.</BIBL></NOTE>.
The&s;e they &s;hed at the latter end of autumn, and renew during the winter;
differ|ing in this from the &s;tag, who &s;heds them in &s;pring and renews
them in &s;ummer. When the roe-buck's head is completely furni&s;hed, it rubs
the horns again&s;t trees in the manner of the &s;tag, and thus &s;trips them
of the rough &s;kin and the blood-ve&s;&s;els, which no longer contribute to
their nouri&s;hment and growth. When the&s;e fall, and new ones begin to
appear, the roe-buck does not retire as the &s;tag to the covert of the wood,
but continues its u&s;ual haunts, only keeping down its head to avoid
&s;triking its horns again&s;t the branches of trees, the pain of which it
&s;eems to feel with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility. The &s;tag, who &s;heds his
horns in &s;ummer, is obliged to &s;eek a retreat from the flies, that at that
time greatly incommode him; but the roe-buck, who &s;heds them in winter, is
under no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity; and, con&s;equently, does not &s;eparate from
its little family, but keeps with the female all the year round<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the growth of the roe-buck, and its arrival 
<PB N="138" REF="153"> at maturity, is much &s;peedier than that of the &s;tag,
&s;o its life is proportionably &s;horter. It &s;eldom is found to extend above
twelve or fif|teen years; and if kept tame it does not live above &s;ix or
&s;even. It is an animal of a very de|licate con&s;titution, requiring variety
of food, air, and exerci&s;e. It mu&s;t be paired with a fe|male, and kept in a
park of at lea&s;t an hundred acres. They may ea&s;ily be &s;ubdued, but never
thoroughly tamed. No arts can teach them to be familiar with the feeder, much
le&s;s attached to him. They &s;till pre&s;erve a part of their natural
wildne&s;s, and are &s;ubject to terrors without a cau&s;e. They &s;ometimes,
in attempt|ing to e&s;cape, &s;trike them&s;elves with &s;uch force again&s;t
the walls of their inclo&s;ure, that they break their limbs, and become utterly
di&s;abled. Whatever care is taken to tame them, they are never entirely to be
relied on, as they have ca|pricious fits of fiercene&s;s, and &s;ometimes
&s;trike at tho&s;e they di&s;like with a degree of force that is very
dangerous.</P>
<P>The cry of the roe-buck is neither &s;o loud nor &s;o frequent as
that of the &s;tag. The young ones have a particular manner of calling to the
dam, which the hunters ea&s;ily imitate, and often thus allure the female to
her de&s;truction. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ions al&s;o they become in a 
<PB N="139" REF="154"> manner intoxicated with their food, which, during the
&s;pring, is &s;aid to ferment in their &s;tomachs, and they are then very
ea&s;ily taken. In &s;ummer they keep clo&s;e under covert of the fore&s;t, and
&s;eldom venture out, except in violent heats, to drink at &s;ome river or
foun|tain. In general, however, they are contented to &s;lake their thir&s;t
with the dew that falls on the gra&s;s and the leaves of trees, and &s;eldom
ri&s;que their &s;afety to &s;atisfy their appetite. They de|light chiefly in
hilly grounds, preferring the tender branches and buds of trees to corn, or
other vegetables; and it is univer&s;ally allowed that the fle&s;h of tho&s;e
between one and two years old is the greate&s;t delicacy that is known. Perhaps
al&s;o, the &s;carcene&s;s of it enhances its flavour.</P>
<P>In America this animal is much more com|mon than in Europe. With
us there are but two known varieties; the red, which is the larger &s;ort; and
the brown, with a &s;pot behind, which is le&s;s. But in the new continent the
breed is extremely numerous, and the varieties in equal proportion. In
Loui&s;iana, where they are ex|tremely common, they are much larger than in
Europe, and the inhabitants live in a great mea&s;ure upon its fle&s;h, which
ta&s;tes like mut|ton when well fatted. They are found al&s;o in 
<PB N="140" REF="155"> Bra&s;il, where they have the name of Cuguacu Apara,
only differing from ours in &s;ome &s;light deviations in the horns. This
animal is al&s;o &s;aid to be common in China; although &s;uch as have
de&s;cribed it &s;eem to confound it with the mu&s;k-goat, which is of a quite
different nature.</P>

<HEAD>THE ELK.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto been de&s;cribing minute animals in compari&s;on
of the Elk; the &s;ize of which, from concurrent te&s;timony, appears to be
equal to that of the elephant it&s;elf. It is an animal rather of the buck than
the &s;tag kind, as its horns are flatted towards the top; but it is far beyond
both in &s;tature, &s;ome of them being known to be above ten feet high. It is
a native both of the old and new continent, being known in Europe under the
name of the Elk, and in America by that of the Moo&s;e-deer. It is &s;ometimes
taken in the German and Ru&s;&s;ian fore&s;ts, although &s;eldom appear|ing;
but it is extremely common in North America, where the natives pur&s;ue, and
track it in the &s;now. The accounts of this ani|mal are extremely various;
&s;ome de&s;cribing it as being no higher than an hor&s;e, and others above
twelve feet high.</P>
<P>As the &s;tature of this creature makes its chief <PB REF="156">

peculiarity, &s;o it were to be wi&s;hed that we could come to &s;ome
preci&s;ion upon that head. If we were to judge of its &s;ize by the horns,
which are &s;ometimes fortuitou&s;ly dug up in many parts of Ireland, we
&s;hould not be much ami&s;s in a&s;cribing them to an animal at lea&s;t ten
feet high. One of the&s;e I have &s;een, which was ten feet nine inches from
one tip to the other. From &s;uch dimen&s;ions, it is ea&s;y to perceive that
it required an animal far be|yond the &s;ize of an hor&s;e to &s;upport them.
To bear an head with &s;uch exten&s;ive and heavy ant|lers, required no &s;mall
degree of &s;trength; and without all doubt the bulk of the body mu&s;t have
been proportionable to the &s;ize of the horns. I remember, &s;ome years ago,
to have &s;een a &s;mall moo&s;e-deer, which was brought from America, by a
gentleman of Ireland; it was about the &s;ize of an hor&s;e, and the horns were
very little larger than tho&s;e of a common &s;tag: this, therefore, &s;erves
to prove that the horns bear an exact proportion to the animal's &s;ize; the
&s;mall elk has but &s;mall horns; whereas tho&s;e enormous ones, which we have
de&s;cribed above, mu&s;t have belonged to a proportionable creature. In all
the more noble animals, na|ture ob&s;erves a perfect &s;ymmetry; and it is not
to be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he fails in this &s;ingle in&s;tance. 
<PB N="142" REF="160"> We have no rea&s;on, therefore, to doubt the accounts of
Jocelyn and Dudley, who affirm, that they have been found fourteen &s;pans;
which, at nine inches to a &s;pan, makes the animal almo&s;t eleven feet high.
Others have extended their accounts to twelve and fourteen feet, which makes
this creature one of the mo&s;t formidable of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>There is but very little difference between the European elk, and
the American moo&s;e-deer, as they are but varieties of the &s;ame animal. It
may be rather larger in America than with us; as in the fore&s;ts of that
unpeopled country, it receives le&s;s di&s;turbance than in our own. In all
places, however, it is timorous and gentle; content with its pa&s;ture, and
never willing to di&s;turb any other animal, when &s;up|plied it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The European elk grows to above &s;even or eight feet high. In the
year 1742, there was a female of this animal &s;hewn at Paris, which was caught
in a fore&s;t of Red Ru&s;&s;ia, belonging to the Cham of Tartary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Rai&s;onn&eacute;e des Animaux. An. Nom
Elan.</BIBL></NOTE>; it was then but young, and its height was even at that
time &s;ix feet &s;even inches; but the de&s;criber ob&s;erves, that it has
&s;ince become much taller and thicker, &s;o that we may &s;uppo&s;e this
female at lea&s;t <PB N="143" REF="161"> &s;even feet high. There have been no
late op|portunities of &s;eeing the male; but, by the rule of proportion, we
may e&s;timate his &s;ize at eight or nine feet at the lea&s;t, which is about
twice as high as an ordinary hor&s;e. The height, however, of the female, which
was mea&s;ured, was but &s;ix feet &s;even inches, Paris mea&s;ure; or almo&s;t
&s;even Engli&s;h feet high. It was ten feet from the tip of the no&s;e to the
in&s;ertion of the tail; and eight feet round the body. The hair was very long
and coar&s;e, like that of a wild boar. The ears re&s;embled tho&s;e of a mule,
and were a foot and an half long. The upper jaw was longer, by &s;ix inches,
than the lower; and, like other ruminating animals, it had no teeth (cutting
teeth I &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;criber means). It had a large beard under the
throat, like a goat; and in the middle of the forehead, between the horns,
there was a bone as large as an egg. The no&s;trils were four inches long on
each &s;ide of the mouth. It made u&s;e of its fore feet, as a defence
again&s;t its enemies. Tho&s;e who &s;hewed it, a&s;&s;erted, that it ran with
a&s;toni&s;hing &s;wiftne&s;s; that it &s;wam al&s;o with equal expedition, and
was very fond of the water. They gave it thirty pounds of bread every day,
be&s;ide hay, and it drank eight <PB N="144" REF="162"> buckets of water. It
was tame and familiar, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive enough to its keeper.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription differs in many circum|&s;tances from that
which we have of the moo&s;e, or American elk, which the French call the
Original. Of the&s;e there are two kinds, the common light grey moo&s;e, which
is not very large; and the black moo&s;e, which grows to an enormous height.
Mr. Dudley ob&s;erves, that a doe or hind of the black moo&s;e kind, of the
fourth year, wanted but an inch of &s;even feet high. All, however, of both
kinds, have flat palmed horns, not unlike the fallow-deer, only that the palm
is much larger, having a &s;hort trunk at the head, and then immediately
&s;pread|ing above a foot broad, with a kind of &s;mall antlers, like teeth, on
one of the edges. In this particular, all of the elk kind agree; as well the
European elk, as the grey and the black moo&s;e-deer.</P>
<P>The grey moo&s;e-deer is about the &s;ize of an hor&s;e; and
although it has large buttocks, its tail is not above an inch long. As in all
of this kind the upper lip is much longer than the under, it is &s;aid that
they continue to go back|ward as they feed. Their no&s;trils are &s;o large
that a man may thru&s;t his hand in a con&s;iderable <PB N="145" REF="163">
way; and their horns are as long as tho&s;e of a &s;tag, but, as was
ob&s;erved, much broader.</P>
<P>The black moo&s;e is the enormous animal mentioned above, from
eight to twelve feet high. Jo&s;&s;eleyn, who is the fir&s;t Engli&s;h writer
that mentions it, &s;ays, that it is a goodly crea|ture, twelve feet high, with
exceeding fair horns, that have broad palms, two fathoms from the top of one
horn to another. He a&s;&s;ures us, that it is a creature, or rather a
mon&s;ter of &s;uperfluity, and many times bigger than an Engli&s;h ox. This
account is confirmed by Dudley; but he does not give &s;o great an ex|pan&s;ion
to the horns, mea&s;uring them only thirty-one inches between one tip and the
other: however, that &s;uch an extraordinary animal as Jo&s;&s;eleyn
de&s;cribes, has actually exi&s;ted, we can make no manner of doubt of, &s;ince
there are horns common enough to be &s;een among us, twelve feet from one tip
to the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals delight in cold countries, feed|ing upon gra&s;s
in &s;ummer, and the bark of trees in winter. When the whole country is deeply
covered with &s;now, the moo&s;e-deer herd together under the tall pine-trees,
&s;trip off the bark, and remain in that part of the fore&s;t while it yields
them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. It is at that time that the natives prepare to hunt
them; <PB N="146" REF="164"> and particularly when the &s;un begins to melt the
&s;now by day, which is frozen again at night; for then the icy cru&s;t which
covers the &s;urface of the &s;now, is too weak to &s;upport &s;o great a bulk,
and only retards the animal's motion. When the Indians, therefore, perceive an
herd of the&s;e at a di&s;tance, they immediately prepare for their pur&s;uit,
which is not, as with us, the &s;port of an hour, but is attended with toil,
difficulty, and danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. vol. ii. p.
436.</BIBL></NOTE>. The timorous animal no &s;ooner ob&s;erves its enemies
approach, than it immediately endeavours to e&s;cape, but &s;inks at every
&s;tep it takes. Still, however, it pur|&s;ues its way through a thou&s;and
ob&s;tacles: the &s;now, which is u&s;ually four feet deep, yields to its
weight, and embarra&s;&s;es its &s;peed; the &s;harp ice wounds its feet; and
its lofty horns are en|tangled in the branches of the fore&s;t, as it
pa&s;&s;es along. The trees, however, are broken down with ea&s;e; and wherever
the moo&s;e-deer runs, it is perceived by the &s;napping off the branches of
trees, as thick as a man's thigh, with its horns. The chace la&s;ts in this
manner for the whole day; and &s;ometimes it has been known to continue for
two, nay three days together; for the pur&s;uers are often not le&s;s ex|cited
by famine, than the pur&s;ued by fear. <PB N="147" REF="165"> Their
per&s;everance, however, generally &s;uc|ceeds; and the Indian who fir&s;t
comes near enough, darts his lance, with unerring aim, which &s;ticks in the
poor animal, and at fir&s;t encrea&s;es its efforts to e&s;cape. In this manner
the moo&s;e trots heavily on, (for that is its u&s;ual pace) till its
pur&s;uers once more come up, and repeat their blow: upon this, it again
&s;um|mons up &s;ufficient vigour to get an head; but, at la&s;t, quite tired,
and &s;pent with lo&s;s of blood, it &s;inks, as the de&s;criber expre&s;&s;es
it, like a ruined building, and makes the earth &s;hake beneath its fall.</P>
<P>This animal, when killed, is a very valuable acqui&s;ition to the
hunters. The fle&s;h is very well ta&s;ted, and &s;aid to be very nouri&s;hing.
The hide is &s;trong, and &s;o thick that it has been often known to turn a
mu&s;ket-ball; how|ever, it is &s;oft and pliable, and, when tanned, the
leather is extremely light, yet very la&s;ting. The fur is a light grey in
&s;ome, and blacki&s;h in others; and when viewed through a micro|&s;cope,
appears &s;pongy like a bulru&s;h, and is &s;maller at the roots and points
than in the middle; for this rea&s;on, it lies very flat and &s;mooth, and
though beaten or abu&s;ed never &s;o much, it always returns to its former
&s;tate. The <PB N="148" REF="166"> horns al&s;o are not le&s;s u&s;eful, being
applied to all the purpo&s;es for which hart&s;horn is bene|ficial: the&s;e are
different in different animals; in &s;ome they re&s;emble entirely tho&s;e of
the European elk, which &s;pread into a broad palm, with &s;mall antlers on one
of the edges; in others they have a branched brow-antler between the bur and
the palm, which the German elk has not; and in this they entirely agree with
tho&s;e who&s;e horns are &s;o frequently dug up in Ireland. This animal is
&s;aid to be troubled with the epilep&s;y, as it is often found to fall down
when pur&s;ued, and thus becomes an ea&s;ier prey; for this rea&s;on, an
imaginary virtue has been a&s;cribed to the hinder hoof, which &s;ome have
&s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;pecific again&s;t all epileptic di&s;orders. This,
however, may be con&s;idered as a vulgar error; as well as that of its curing
it&s;elf of this di&s;order by ap|plying the hinder hoof behind the ear. After
all, this animal is but very indifferently and confu&s;edly de&s;cribed by
travellers; each mixing his account with &s;omething fal&s;e or trivial; often
mi&s;taking &s;ome other quadrupede for the elk, and confounding its hi&s;tory.

<HEAD>THE REIN-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>OF all animals of the deer kind, the Rein-Deer is the mo&s;t
extraordinary and the mo&s;t u&s;eful. It is a native of the icy regions of the
north; and though many attempts have been made to accu&s;tom it to a more
&s;outhern cli|mate, it &s;hortly feels the influence of the change, and in a
few months declines and dies. Nature &s;eems to have fitted it entirely to
an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ities of that hardy race of mankind that live near the
pole. As the&s;e would find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t among their
barren &s;nowy mountains without its aid, &s;o this animal can live only there,
where its a&s;&s;i&s;tance is mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. From it alone
the natives of Lapland and Greenland &s;upply mo&s;t of their wants; it
an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of an hor&s;e, to convey them and their &s;canty
fur|niture from one mountain to another; it an&s;wers <PB REF="169">

purpo&s;es of a cow, in giving milk; and it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of the
&s;heep, in furni&s;hing them with a warm, though an homely kind of cloathing.
From this quadrupede alone, there|fore, they receive as many advantages as we
derive from three of our mo&s;t u&s;eful creatures; &s;o that Providence does
not leave the&s;e poor outca&s;ts entirely de&s;titute, but gives them a
faithful dome&s;tic, more patient and &s;erviceable than any other in
nature.</P>
<P>The rein-deer re&s;embles the American elk in the fa&s;hion of its
horns. It is not ea&s;y in words to de&s;cribe the&s;e minute differences; nor
will the reader, perhaps, have a di&s;tinct idea of the &s;imilitude, when told
that both have brow-antlers, very large, and hanging over their eyes, palmated
towards the top, and bending forward, like a bow. But here the &s;imilitude
between the&s;e two animals ends; for, as the elk is much larger than the
&s;tag, &s;o the rein-deer is much &s;maller. It is lower and &s;tronger built
than the &s;tag; its legs are &s;horter and thicker, and its hoofs much broader
than in that animal; its hair is much thicker and warmer, its horns much larger
in proportion, and branching forward over its eyes; its ears are much larger;
its pace is rather a trot than a bounding, and this it can continue for a whole
<PB N="151" REF="172"> day; its hoofs are cloven and moveable, &s;o that it
&s;preads them abroad as it goes, to prevent its &s;inking in the &s;now. When
it proceeds on a journey, it lays its great horns on its back, while there are
two branches which always hang over its forehead, and almo&s;t cover its face.
One thing &s;eems peculiar to this animal and the elk; which is, that as they
move along, their hoofs are heard to crack with a pretty loud noi&s;e. This
ari&s;es from their manner of treading; for as they re&s;t upon their cloven
hoof, it &s;preads on the ground, and the two divi&s;ions &s;eparate from each
other; but when they lift it, the divi&s;ions clo&s;e again, and &s;trike
again&s;t each other with a crack. The female al&s;o of the rein-deer has horns
as well as the male, by which the &s;pecies is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other
animals of the deer kind what&s;oever.</P>
<P>When the rein-deer fir&s;t &s;hed their coat of hair, they are
brown; but, in proportion as &s;ummer approaches, their hair begins to grow
whiti&s;h; until, at la&s;t, they are nearly grey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For
the greate&s;t part of this de&s;cription of the Rein-Deer, I am obliged to Mr.
Hoffberg; upon who&s;e authority, being a native of Sweden, and an expe|rienced
naturali&s;t, we may confidently rely.</NOTE>. They are, however, always black
about the eyes. The neck has long hair, hanging down, <PB N="152" REF="173">
and coar&s;er than upon any other part of the body. The feet, ju&s;t at the
in&s;ertion of the hoof, are &s;urrounded with a ring of white. The hair in
general &s;tands &s;o thick over the whole body, that if one &s;hould attempt
to &s;e|parate it, the &s;kin will no where appear un|covered: whenever it
falls al&s;o, it is not &s;een to drop from the root, as in other quadrupedes,
but &s;eems broken &s;hort near the bottom; &s;o that the lower part of the
hair is &s;een growing, while the upper falls away.</P>
<P>The horns of the female are made like tho&s;e of the male, except
that they are &s;maller and le&s;s branching. As in the re&s;t of the deer
kind, they &s;prout from the points; and al&s;o in the beginning, are
furni&s;hed with an hairy cru&s;t, which &s;upports the blood-ve&s;&s;els, of
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility. The rein-deer &s;hed their horns, after
rutting-time, at the latter end of November; and they are not completely
fur|ni&s;hed again till towards autumn. The female always retains hers till
&s;he brings forth, and then &s;heds them, about the beginning of No|vember. If
&s;he be barren, however, which is not unfrequently the ca&s;e, &s;he does not
&s;hed them till winter. The ca&s;tration of the rein-deer does not prevent the
&s;hedding of their horns: tho&s;e which are the &s;tronge&s;t, ca&s;t them 
<PB N="153" REF="174"> early in winter; tho&s;e which are more weakly, not &s;o
&s;oon. Thus, from all the&s;e, circum|&s;tances, we &s;ee how greatly this
animal differs from the common &s;tag. The female of the rein-deer has horns,
which the hind is never &s;een to have; the rein-deer, when ca&s;trated, renews
its horns, which we are a&s;&s;ured the &s;tag never does: it differs not
le&s;s in its habits and manner of living, being tame, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and
patient; while the &s;tag is wild, capricious, and unmanageable.</P>
<P>The rein-deer, as was &s;aid, is naturally an inhabitant of the
countries bordering on the arctic circle. It is not unknown to the natives of
Siberia. The North Americans al&s;o hunt it, under the name of the
<HI>caribou.</HI> But in Lap|land, this animal is converted to the utmo&s;t
advantage; and &s;ome herd&s;men of that country are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s
above a thou&s;and in a &s;ingle herd.</P>
<P>Lapland is divided into two di&s;tricts, the moun|tainous and the
woody. The mountainous part of the country is at be&s;t barren and bleak,
exce&s;|&s;ively cold, and uninhabitable during the winter; &s;till, however,
it is the mo&s;t de&s;ireable part of this frightful region, and is mo&s;t
thickly peopled during the &s;ummer. The natives ge|nerally re&s;ide on the
declivity of the mountains, <PB N="154" REF="175"> three or four cottages
together, and lead a chearful and a &s;ocial life. Upon the approach of winter,
they are obliged to migrate into the plains below, each bringing down his whole
herd, which often amounts to more than a thou&s;and, and leading them where the
pa&s;ture is in greate&s;t plenty. The woody part of the country is much more
de&s;olate and hideous. The whole face of nature there pre&s;ents a fright|ful
&s;cene of trees without fruit, and plains without verdure. As far as the eye
can reach, nothing is to be &s;een, even in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, but barren
fields, covered only with a mo&s;s, almo&s;t as white as &s;now; no gra&s;s, no
flowery land&s;capes, only here and there a pine-tree, which may have e&s;caped
the frequent conflagrations by which the natives burn down their fore&s;ts. But
what is very extra|ordinary, as the whole &s;urface of the country is cloathed
in white, &s;o, on the contrary, the fore&s;ts &s;eem to the la&s;t degree dark
and gloomy. While one kind of mo&s;s makes the fields look as if they were
covered with &s;now, another kind blackens over all the trees, and even hides
their verdure. This mo&s;s, however, which deforms the country, &s;erves for
its only &s;upport, as upon it alone the rein-deer can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The
inhabitants, who, during the &s;um|mer, <PB N="155" REF="176"> lived among the
mountains, drive down their herds in winter, and people the plains and woods
below. Such of the Laplanders as inhabit the woods and the plains all the year
round, live remote from each other, and having been u&s;ed to &s;olitude, are
melancholy, igno|rant, and helple&s;s. They are much poorer al&s;o than the
mountaineers, for, while one of tho&s;e is found to po&s;&s;e&s;s a thou&s;and
rein-deer at a time, none of the&s;e are ever known to rear the tenth part of
that number. The rein-deer makes the riches of this people; and the cold
mountainy parts of the country agree be&s;t with its con&s;titution. It is for
this rea&s;on, therefore, that the mountains of Lapland are preferred to the
woods; and that many claim an exclu&s;ive right to the tops of hills, covered
in almo&s;t eternal &s;now.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ummer begins to appear, the Laplander who had
fed his rein-deer upon the lower grounds, during the winter, then drives them
up to the mountains, and leaves the woody country, and the low pa&s;ture, which
at that &s;ea&s;on are truly deplorable. The gnats, bred, by the &s;un's heat,
in the mar&s;hy bottoms, and the weedy lakes, with which the country abounds
more than any other part of the world, are all upon the wing, and fill the
whole air, <PB N="156" REF="177"> like clouds of du&s;t in a dry windy day. The
inhabitants, at that time, are obliged to daub their faces with pitch, mixed
with milk, to &s;hield their &s;kins from their depredations. All places are
then &s;o greatly infe&s;ted, that the poor natives can &s;carce open their
mouths without fear of &s;uffocation; the in&s;ects enter, from their numbers
and minutene&s;s, into the no&s;trils and the eyes, and do not leave the
&s;ufferer a mo|ment at his ea&s;e. But they are chiefly enemies to the
rein-deer: the horns of that animal being then in their tender &s;tate, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of extreme &s;en&s;ibility, a fami&s;hed cloud of in|&s;ects
in&s;tantly &s;ettle upon them, and drive the poor animal almo&s;t to
di&s;traction. In this ex|tremity, there are but two remedies, to which the
quadrupede, as well as its ma&s;ter, are ob|liged to have recour&s;e. The one
is, for both to take &s;helter near their cottage, where a large fire of tree
mo&s;s is prepared, which filling the whole place with &s;moke, keeps off the
gnat, and thus, by one inconvenience, expels a greater; the other is, to
a&s;cend to the highe&s;t &s;ummit of the mountains, where the air is too thin,
and the weather too cold, for the gnats to come. There the rein-deer are &s;een
to continue the whole day, although without food, rather than to venture down
into the lower parts, <PB N="157" REF="178"> where they can have no defence
again&s;t their uncea&s;ing per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the gnat, there is al&s;o a gadfly, that, during the
&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, is no le&s;s formidable to them. This in&s;ect is bred
under their &s;kins, where the egg has been depo&s;ed the preceding &s;ummer;
and it is no &s;ooner produced as a fly, than it again endeavours to depo&s;ite
its eggs in &s;ome place &s;imilar to that from whence it came. Whenever,
therefore, it appears flying over an herd of rein-deer, it puts the whole body,
how numerous &s;oever, into motion; they know their enemy, and do all they can,
by to&s;&s;ing their horns, and running among each other, to terrify or avoid
it. All their en|deavours, however, are too generally without effect; the
gadfly is &s;een to depo&s;ite its eggs, which burrowing under the &s;kin,
wound it in &s;everal places, and often bring on an incurable di&s;order.</P>
<P>In the morning, therefore, as &s;oon as the Lapland herd&s;man
drives his deer to pa&s;ture, his greate&s;t care is to keep them from
&s;caling the &s;ummits of the mountains where there is no food, but where they
go merely to be at ea&s;e from the gnats and gadflies that are ever annoying
them. At this time, there is a &s;trong conte&s;t between the dogs and the
deer; the one <PB N="158" REF="179"> endeavouring to climb up again&s;t the
&s;ide of the hill, and to gain tho&s;e &s;ummits that are co|vered in eternal
&s;nows; the other, forcing them down, by barking and threatening, and, in a
manner, compelling them into the places where their food is in the greate&s;t
plenty. There the men and dogs confine them; guarding them with the utmo&s;t
precaution the whole day, and driving them home at the proper &s;ea&s;ons for
milking.</P>
<P>The female brings forth in the middle of May, and gives milk till
about the middle of October. Every morning and evening, during the &s;ummer,
the herd&s;man returns to the cottage with his deer to be milked, where the
women previou&s;ly have kindled up a &s;moky fire, which effectually drives off
the gnats, and keeps the rein-deer quiet while milking. The fe|male furni&s;hes
about a pint, which, though thinner than that of the cow, is, neverthele&s;s,
&s;weeter and more nouri&s;hing. This done, the herd&s;man drives them back to
pa&s;ture; as he neither folds nor hou&s;es them, neither provides for their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence during the winter, nor im|proves their pa&s;ture by
cultivation.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the winter, when the gnats and flies are no
longer to be feared, the Laplander de&s;cends into the lower grounds; 
<PB N="159" REF="180"> and, as there are but few to di&s;pute the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that de&s;olate country, he has an exten&s;ive range to
feed them in. Their chief and almo&s;t their only food at that time, is the
white mo&s;s already mentioned; which, from its being fed upon by this animal,
obtains the name of the <HI>lichen rangiferinus.</HI> This is of two kinds: the
woody lichen, which covers almo&s;t all the de&s;ert parts of the country like
&s;now; the other is black, and covers the branches of the trees in very great
quantities. However unplea&s;ing the&s;e may be to the &s;pectator, the native
e&s;teems them as one of his choice&s;t benefits, and the mo&s;t indulgent gift
of nature. While his fields are cloathed with mo&s;s, he envies neither the
fertility nor the verdure of the more &s;outhern land&s;cape; dre&s;&s;ed up
warmly in his deer-&s;kin cloaths, with &s;hoes and gloves of the &s;ame
ma|terials, he drives his herds along the de&s;ert; fearle&s;s and at ea&s;e,
ignorant of any higher lux|ury than what their milk and &s;moke dried fle&s;h
afford him. Hardened to the climate, he &s;leeps in the mid&s;t of ice; or
awaking, dozes away his time with tobacco; while his faithful dogs &s;up|ply
his place, and keep the herd from wander|ing. The deer, in the mean time, with
in&s;tincts adapted to the &s;oil, pur&s;ue their food, though covered in the
deepe&s;t &s;now. They turn it up <PB N="160" REF="181"> with their no&s;es,
like &s;wine; and even though its &s;urface be frozen and &s;tiff, yet the hide
is &s;o hardened in that part, that they ea&s;ily overcome the difficulty. It
&s;ometimes, however, happens, though but rarely, that the winter commences
with rain, and a fro&s;t en&s;uing, covers the whole country with a glazed
cru&s;t of ice. Then, in|deed, both the rein-deer and the Laplander are undone;
they have no provi&s;ions laid up in ca&s;e of accident, and the only
re&s;ource is to cut down the large pine-trees, that are covered with mo&s;s,
which furni&s;hes but a &s;canty &s;upply; &s;o that the greate&s;t part of the
herd is then &s;een to peri&s;h, without a po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
It &s;ometimes al&s;o happens, that even this &s;upply is wanting; for the
Laplander often burns down his woods, in order to improve and fertilize the
&s;oil which produces the mo&s;s, upon which he feeds his cattle.</P>
<P>In this manner the pa&s;toral life is &s;till con|tinued near the
pole; neither the coldne&s;s of the winter, nor the length of the nights,
neither the wildne&s;s of the fore&s;t, nor the vagrant di&s;po&s;i|tion of the
herd, interrupt the even tenour of the Laplander's life. By night and day he is
&s;een attending his favourite cattle, and remains unaffected, in a &s;ea&s;on
which would be &s;peedy death to tho&s;e bred up in a milder climate. He 
<PB N="161" REF="182"> gives him&s;elf no unea&s;ine&s;s to hou&s;e his herds
or to provide a winter &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them; he is at the trouble neither
of manuring his grounds, nor bringing in his harve&s;ts; he is not the
hire|ling of another's luxury; all his labours are to obviate the
nece&s;&s;ities of his own &s;itua|tion; and the&s;e he undergoes with
chearfulne&s;s, as he is &s;ure to enjoy the fruits of his own in|du&s;try. If,
therefore, we compare the Lap|lander with the pea&s;ant of more &s;outhern
cli|mates, we &s;hall have little rea&s;on to pity his &s;ituation; the climate
in which he lives is ra|ther terrible to us than to him; and, as for the
re&s;t, he is ble&s;&s;ed with liberty, plenty, and ea&s;e. The rein-deer alone
&s;upplies him with all the wants of life, and &s;ome of the conve|niencies,
&s;erving to &s;hew how many advantages nature is capable of &s;upplying, when
nece&s;&s;ity gives the call. Thus, the poor, little, helple&s;s native, who
was originally, perhaps, driven by fear or famine into tho&s;e inho&s;pitable
cli|mates, would &s;eem, at fir&s;t view, to be the mo&s;t wretched of mankind:
but it is far other|wi&s;e, he looks round among the few wild ani|mals that his
barren country can maintain, and &s;ingles out one from among them, and that of
a kind which the re&s;t of mankind have not thought worth taking from a &s;tate
of nature; <PB N="162" REF="183"> this he cultivates, propagates, and
multiplies, and from this alone derives every comfort that can &s;often the
&s;everity of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The rein-deer of this country are of two kinds, the wild and the
tame. The wild are larger and &s;tronger, but more mi&s;chievous than the
others. Their breed, however, is pre|ferred to that of the tame; and the female
of the latter is often &s;ent into the woods, from whence &s;he returns home
impregnated by one of the wild kind. The&s;e are fitter for drawing the
&s;ledge, to which the Laplander accu&s;toms them betimes, and yoaks them to it
by a &s;trap, which goes round the neck, and comes down between their legs. The
&s;ledge is extremely light, and &s;hod at the bottom, with the &s;kin of a
young deer, the hair turned to &s;lide on the frozen &s;now. The per&s;on who
&s;its on this guides the animal with a cord, fa&s;tened round the horns, and
encourages it to proceed with his voice, and drives it with a goad. Some of the
wild breed, though by far the &s;tronge&s;t, are yet found re|fractory, and
often turn upon their drivers; who have then no other re&s;ource but to cover
them|&s;elves with their &s;ledge, and let the animal vent its fury upon that.
But it is otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e that are tame; no creature can be more
active, patient, and willing: when hard pu&s;hed, <PB N="163" REF="184"> they
will trot nine or ten Swedi&s;h miles, or between fifty and &s;ixty Engli&s;h
miles, at one &s;tretch. But, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the poor obe|dient creature
fatigues it&s;elf to death; and, if not prevented by the Laplander, who kills
it immediately, it will die a day or two after. In general, they can go about
thirty miles without halting, and this without any great or dangerous efforts.
This, which is the only manner of travelling in that country, can be performed
only in winter, when the &s;now is glazed over with ice; and although it be a
very &s;peedy me|thod of conveyance, yet it is inconvenient, dangerous, and
trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>In order to make the&s;e animals more obe|dient, and more
generally &s;erviceable, they ca&s;trate them; which operation the Laplanders
perform with their teeth; the&s;e become &s;ooner fat when taken from labour;
and they are found to be &s;tronger in drawing the &s;ledge. There is u&s;ually
one male left entire for every &s;ix fe|males; the&s;e are in rut from the
Fea&s;t of St. Matthew to about Michaelmas. At this time, their horns are
thoroughly burni&s;hed, and their battles among each other are fierce and
ob&s;ti|nate. The females do not begin to breed till they are two years old;
and then they continue regularly breeding every year till they are
&s;u|perannuated. <PB N="164" REF="185"> They go with young above eight months,
and generally bring forth two at a time. The fondne&s;s of the dam for her
young is very remarkable; it often happens that when they are &s;eparated from
her, &s;he will return from pa&s;ture, keep calling round the cottage for them,
and will not de&s;i&s;t until, dead or alive, they are brought and laid at her
feet. They are at fir&s;t of a light brown; but they become darker with age;
and at la&s;t the old ones are of a brown almo&s;t approaching to blackne&s;s.
The young follow the dam for two or three years; but they do not acquire their
full growth until four. They are then broke in, and managed for drawing the
&s;ledge; and they continue &s;erviceable for four or five years longer. They
never live above fifteen or &s;ixteen years; and, when they arrive at the
proper age, the Laplander generally kills them for the &s;ake of their &s;kins
and their fle&s;h. This he performs by &s;triking them on the back of the neck,
with his knife, into the &s;pinal marrow; upon which they in&s;tantly fall, and
he then cuts the arteries that lead to the heart, and lets the blood
di&s;|charge it&s;elf into the cavity of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any part of this animal that is not converted to
its peculiar u&s;es. As &s;oon as it begins to grow old, and &s;ome time before
<PB N="165" REF="186"> the rut, it is killed, and the fle&s;h dried in the air.
It is al&s;o &s;ometimes hardened with &s;moke, and laid up for travelling
provi&s;ion, when the natives migrate from one part of the country to another.
During the winter, the rein-deer are &s;laughter'd as &s;heep with us; and
every four per&s;ons in the family are allowed one rein-deer for their week's
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In &s;pring, they &s;pare the herd as much as they can, and
live upon fre&s;h fi&s;h. In &s;ummer, the milk and curd of the rein-deer makes
their chief provi|&s;ion; and, in autumn, they live wholly upon fowls, which
they kill with a cro&s;s-bow, or catch in &s;pringes. Nor is this &s;o &s;canty
an al|lowance; &s;ince, at that time, the &s;ea-fowls come in &s;uch abundance
that their ponds and &s;prings are covered over. The&s;e are not &s;o &s;hy as
with us, but yield them&s;elves an ea&s;y prey. They are chiefly allured to
tho&s;e places by the &s;warms of gnats which infe&s;t the country during
&s;ummer, and now repay the former inconve|niencies, by inviting &s;uch numbers
of birds as &s;upply the natives with food a fourth part of the year, in great
abundance.</P>
<P>The milk, when newly taken, is warmed in a cauldron, and thickened
with rennet, and then the curd is pre&s;&s;ed into chee&s;es, which are little
and well ta&s;ted. The&s;e are never found to <PB N="166" REF="187"> breed
mites as the chee&s;e of other countries, probably becau&s;e the mite fly is
not to be found in Lapland. The whey which remains is warmed up again, and
becomes of a con&s;i&s;tence as if thickened with the white of eggs. Upon this
the Laplanders feed during the &s;ummer; it is plea&s;ant and well ta&s;ted,
but not very nou|ri&s;hing. As to butter they very &s;eldom make any, becau&s;e
the milk affords but a very &s;mall quantity, and this, both in ta&s;te and
con&s;i&s;tence, is more nearly re&s;embling to &s;uet. They never keep their
milk till it turns &s;our; and do not dre&s;s it into the variety of di&s;hes
which the more &s;outhern countries are known to do. The only delicacy they
make from it is with wood &s;orrel, which being boiled up with it, and
coagulating, the whole is put into ca&s;ks, or deer-&s;kins, and kept under
ground to be eaten in winter.</P>
<P>The &s;kin is even a more valuable part of this animal than either
of the former. From that part of it which covered the head and feet, they make
their &s;trong &s;now &s;hoes with the hair on the out&s;ide. Of the other
parts they compo&s;e their garments, which are extremely warm, and which cover
them all over. The hair of the&s;e al&s;o is on the out&s;ide; and they
&s;ometimes line them within with the fur of the Glutton, or &s;ome other warm
furr'd animal of that cli|mate. <PB N="167" REF="188"> The&s;e &s;kins al&s;o
&s;erve them for beds. They &s;pread them on each &s;ide of the fire, upon the
leaves of the dwarf birch-tree, and in this manner lie both &s;oft and warm.
Many gar|ments, made of the &s;kin of the rein deer, are &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ery year to the inhabitants of the
more &s;outhern parts of Europe; and they are found &s;o &s;erviceable in
keeping out the cold, that even people of the fir&s;t rank are known to wear
them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, no part of this animal is thrown away as u&s;ele&s;s
The blood is pre&s;erved in &s;mall ca&s;ks, to make &s;auce with the marrow in
&s;pring. The horns are &s;old to be converted into glue. The &s;inews are
dried, and divided &s;o as to make the &s;tronge&s;t kind of &s;owing thread,
not unlike catgut. The tongues, which are con&s;idered as a great delicacy, are
dried, and &s;old into the more &s;outhern provinces. The inte&s;tines
them&s;elves are wa&s;hed like our tripe, and in high e&s;teem among the
natives. Thus the Laplander finds all his nece&s;&s;ities amply &s;upplied from
this &s;ingle animal; and he who has a large herd of the&s;e animals has no
idea of higher luxury.</P>
<P>But, although the rein-deer be a very hardy and vigorous animal,
it is not without its di&s;|ea&s;es. I have already mentioned the pain it 
<PB N="168" REF="189"> feels from the gnat, and the apprehen&s;ions it is under
from the gad-fly. Its hide is often found pierced in an hundred places, like a
&s;ieve, from this in&s;ect, and not a few die in their third year, from this
very cau&s;e Their teats al&s;o are &s;ubject to cracking, &s;o that blood
comes in&s;tead of milk. They &s;ometimes take a loathing for their food; and,
in&s;tead of eating, &s;tand &s;till, and chew the cud. They are al&s;o
troubled with a vertigo, like the elk, and turn round often till they die. The
Laplander judges of their &s;tate by the manner of their turning. If they turn
to the right, he judges their di&s;order but &s;light; if they turn to the
left, he deems it incurable. The rein-deer are al&s;o &s;ubject to ulcers near
the hoof, which unqualifies them for travelling, or keeping with the herd. But
the mo&s;t fatal di&s;order of all is that which the na|tives call the
&s;uddataka, which attacks this ani|mal at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. The
in&s;tant it is &s;eized with this di&s;ea&s;e it begins to breathe with
greater difficulty, its eyes begin to &s;tare, and its no&s;trils to expand. It
acquires al&s;o an un|u&s;ual degree of ferocity, and attacks all it meets
indi&s;criminately. Still, however, it continues to feed as if in health, but
is not &s;een to chew the cud, and it lies down more frequently than before. In
this manner it continues, every day <PB N="169" REF="190"> con&s;uming and
growing more lean, till at la&s;t it dies from mere inanition; and not one of
the&s;e that are attacked with this di&s;order are ever found to recover.
Notwith&s;tanding, it is but very lately known in that part of the world;
although, during the la&s;t ten or fifteen years, it has &s;poiled whole
provinces of this nece&s;&s;ary creature. It is contagious; and the moment the
Laplander perceives any of his herd infected, he ha&s;tens to kill them
immediately, before it &s;preads any farther. When examined internally, there
is a frothy &s;ub&s;tance found in the brain, and round the lungs; the
inte&s;tines are lax and flabby, and the &s;pleen is dimini&s;hed almo&s;t to
nothing. The Laplander's only cure in all the&s;e di&s;orders, is to anoint the
animal's back with tar; if this does not &s;ucceed, he con&s;iders the
di&s;ea&s;e as beyond the power of art; and, with his natural phlegm, &s;ubmits
to the &s;eve|rities of fortune.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the internal maladies of this animal there are &s;ome
external enemies which it has to fear. The bears now and then make
depreda|tions upon the herd; but of all their per&s;ecu|tors, the creature
called the Glutton is the mo&s;t dangerous and the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. The
war between the&s;e is carried on not le&s;s in Lapland than in North America,
where the rein-deer is <PB N="170" REF="191"> called the Caribow, and the
Glutton the Carca|jou. This animal, which is not above the &s;ize of a badger,
waits whole weeks together for its prey, hid in the branches of &s;ome
&s;preading tree; and when the wild rein-deer pa&s;&s;es under|neath, it
in&s;tantly drops down upon it, fixing its teeth and claws into the neck,
ju&s;t behind the horns. It is in vain that the wounded ani|mal then flies for
protection, that it ru&s;tles among the branches of the fore&s;t, the Glutton
&s;till holds its former po&s;ition; and, although it often lo&s;es a part of
its &s;kin and fle&s;h, which are rubbed off again&s;t the trees, yet it
&s;till keeps fa&s;t, until its prey drops with fatigue and lo&s;s of blood.
The deer has but one only method of e&s;cape, which is by jumping into the
water; that element its enemy cannot endure; for, as we are told, it quits its
hold immediately, and then thinks only of providing for its own pro|per
&s;ecurity.</P>

<PB N="171" REF="192">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Quadrupedes of the Hog Kind.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMALS of the hog kind &s;eem to unite in them&s;elves all tho&s;e
di&s;tinctions by which others are &s;eparated. They re&s;emble tho&s;e of the
hor&s;e kind in the number of their teeth, which in all amount to forty-four,
in the length of their head, and in having but a &s;ingle &s;to|mach. They
re&s;emble the cow kind in their cloven hoofs and the po&s;ition of their
inte&s;tines; and they re&s;emble tho&s;e of the claw-footed kind in their
appetite for fle&s;h, in their not chewing the cud, and in their numerous
progeny. Thus this &s;pecies &s;erves to fill up that cha&s;m which is found
between the carnivorous kinds and tho&s;e that live upon gra&s;s; being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ravening appetite of the one, and the inof|fen&s;ive
nature of the other. We may con&s;ider them, therefore, as of a middle nature,
which we can refer neither to the rapacious nor the peaceful kinds, and yet
partaking &s;omewhat of the nature of both. Like the rapacious kinds, they are
found to have &s;hort inte&s;tines; their hoofs al&s;o, though cloven to the
&s;ight, will, upon anatomical in&s;pection, appear to be &s;up|plied with
bones like bea&s;ts of prey; and the <PB N="172" REF="193"> number of their
teats al&s;o encrea&s;e the &s;imili|tude: on the other hand, in a natural
&s;tate they live upon vegetables, and &s;eldom &s;eek after animal food,
except when urged by ne|ce&s;&s;ity. They offend no other animal of the
fore&s;t at the &s;ame time that they are furni&s;hed with arms to terrify the
brave&s;t.</P>
<P>The Wild Boar, which is the original of all the varieties we find in
this creature, is by no means &s;o &s;tupid nor &s;o filthy an animal as that
we have reduced to tamene&s;s; he is much &s;maller than the tame hog, and does
not vary in his colour as tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic kind do, but is always
found of an iron grey, inclining to black; his &s;nout is much longer than that
of the tame hog, and the ears are &s;horter, rounder, and black; of which
colour are al&s;o the feet and the tail. He roots the ground in a different
manner from the common hog; for as this turns up the earth in little &s;pots
here and there, &s;o the wild boar plows it up like a furrow, and does
irreparable damage in the cultivated lands of the farmer. The tu&s;ks al&s;o of
this animal are larger than in the tame breed, &s;ome of them being &s;een
almo&s;t a foot long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
147.</BIBL></NOTE>. The&s;e, as is well known, grow from both the under and
upper jaw, bend upwards circu|larly, <PB N="173" REF="194"> and are exceeding
&s;harp at the points. They differ from the tu&s;ks of the elephant in this,
that they never fall; and it is remarkable of all the hog kind, that they never
&s;hed their teeth as other animals are &s;een to do. The tu&s;ks of the lower
jaw are always the mo&s;t to be dreaded, and are found to give very terrible
wounds.</P>
<P>The wild boar can properly be called neither a &s;olitary nor a
gregarious animal. The three fir&s;t years the whole litter follows the &s;ow,
and the family lives in a herd together. They are then called bea&s;ts of
company, and unite their common forces again&s;t the inva&s;ions of the wolf,
or the more formidable bea&s;ts of prey. Upon this their principal &s;afety
while young depends, for when attacked they give each other mutual
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, calling to each other with a very loud and fierce note; the
&s;tronge&s;t face the dan|ger; they form a ring, and the weake&s;t fall into
the center. In this po&s;ition few ravenous bea&s;ts dare venture to attack
them, but pur&s;ue the chace where there is le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance and danger.
How|ever, when the wild boar is come to a &s;tate of maturity, and when
con&s;cious of his own &s;u|perior &s;trength, he then walks the fore&s;t
alone, and fearle&s;s. At that time he dreads no &s;ingle creature, nor does he
turn out of his way even <PB N="174" REF="195"> for man him&s;elf. He does not
&s;eek danger, and he does not much &s;eem to avoid it.</P>
<P>This animal is therefore &s;eldom attacked, but at a di&s;advantage,
either by numbers, or when found &s;leeping by moon-light. The hunting the wild
boar is one of the principal amu&s;e|ments of the nobility in tho&s;e countries
where it is to be found. The dogs provided for this &s;port are of the &s;low
heavy kind. Tho&s;e u&s;ed for hunting the &s;tag, or the roe-buck, would be
very improper, as they would too &s;oon come up with their prey; and, in&s;tead
of a chace, would only furni&s;h out an engagement. A &s;mall ma&s;tiff is
therefore cho&s;en; nor are the hunters much mindful of the goodne&s;s of their
no&s;e, as the wild boar leaves &s;o &s;trong a &s;cent, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible for them to mi&s;take its cour&s;e. They never hunt any but the
large&s;t and the olde&s;t, which are known by their tracks. When the boar is
<HI>rear'd,</HI> as is the expre&s;&s;ion for driving him from his covert, he
goes &s;lowly and uniformly forward, not much afraid, nor very far before his
pur&s;uers. At the end of every half mile, or thereabouts, he turns round,
&s;tops till the hounds come up, and offers to at|tack them. The&s;e, on the
other hand, know|ing their danger, keep off, and bay him at a di&s;tance. After
they have for a while gazed <PB N="175" REF="196"> upon each other, with mutual
animo&s;ity, the boar again &s;lowly goes on his cour&s;e, and the dogs renew
their pur&s;uit. In this manner the charge is &s;u&s;tained, and the chace
continues till the boar is quite tired, and refu&s;es to go any farther. The
dogs then attempt to clo&s;e in upon him from behind; tho&s;e which are young,
fierce, and unaccu&s;tomed to the chace, are ge|nerally the foremo&s;t, and
often lo&s;e their lives by their ardour. Tho&s;e which are older and better
trained are content to wait until the hun|ters come up, who &s;trike at him
with their &s;pears, and, after &s;everal blows, di&s;patch or di&s;|able him.
The in&s;tant the animal is killed, they cut off the te&s;ticles, which would
other|wi&s;e give a taint to the fle&s;h; and the hunt&s;|men celebrate the
victory with their horns.</P>
<P>The hog, in a natural &s;tate, is found to feed chiefly upon roots
and vegetables; it &s;eldom attacks any other animal, being content with &s;uch
provi&s;ions as it procures without danger. Whatever animal happens to die in
the fore&s;t, or is &s;o wounded that it can make no re&s;i&s;tance, becomes a
prey to the hog, who &s;eldom refu&s;es animal food, how putrid &s;oever,
although it is never at the pains of taking or procuring it alive. For this
rea&s;on, it &s;eems a glutton ra|ther by accident than choice, content with
ve|getable <PB N="176" REF="197"> food, and only devouring fle&s;h when
pre&s;&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity, and when it happens to offer. Indeed, if we
behold the hog in its do|me&s;tic &s;tate, it is the mo&s;t &s;ordid and brutal
animal in nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. ix. p.
14.</BIBL></NOTE>. The aukwardne&s;s of its form &s;eems to influence its
appetites; and all its &s;en&s;ations are as gro&s;s as its &s;hapes are
un|&s;ightly. It &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only of an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of
eating; and &s;eems to make choice only of what other animals find the mo&s;t
offen|&s;ive. But we ought to con&s;ider that the hog with us is in an
unnatural &s;tate, and that it is in a manner compelled to feed in this filthy
manner from wanting that proper nouri&s;hment which it finds in the fore&s;t.
When in a &s;tate of wild|ne&s;s, it is of all other quadrupedes the mo&s;t
delicate in the choice of what vegetables it &s;hall feed on, and rejects a
greater number than any of the re&s;t. The cow, for in&s;tance, as we are
a&s;&s;ured by Linnaeus, eats two hundred and &s;e|venty-&s;ix plants, and
rejects two hundred and eighteen; the goat eats four hundred and forty-nine,
and rejects an hundred and twenty-&s;ix; the &s;heep eats three hundred and
eighty &s;even, and rejects an hundred and forty-one; the hor&s;e eats two
hundred and &s;ixty-two, and re|jects two hundred and twelve; but the hog, 
<PB N="177" REF="198"> more nice in its provi&s;ion than any of the former,
eats but &s;eventy-two plants, and rejects an hun|dred and &s;eventy-one. The
indelicacy of this animal is, therefore, rather in our apprehen&s;ions than in
its nature; &s;ince we find it makes a very di&s;tingui&s;hing choice in the
quality of its food; and if it does not reject animal putrefac|tion, it may be
becau&s;e it is abridged in that food which is mo&s;t whole&s;ome and agreeable
to it in a &s;tate of nature. This is certain, that its palate is not
in&s;en&s;ible to the difference of eat|ables; for, where it finds variety, it
will reject the wor&s;t, with as di&s;tingui&s;hing a ta&s;te as any other
quadrupede what&s;oever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol.
i. p. 42.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the orchards of peach-trees in North America, where
the hog has plenty of delicious food, it is ob&s;erved, that it will reject the
fruit that has lain but a few hours on the ground, and continue on the watch
whole hours together for a fre&s;h windfall.</P>
<P>However, the hog is naturally formed in a more imperfect manner than
the other animals that we have rendered dome&s;tic around us, le&s;s active in
its motions, le&s;s furni&s;hed with in&s;tinct in knowing what to pur&s;ue or
avoid. Without attachment, and incapable of in&s;truction, it continues, while
it lives, an u&s;ele&s;s, or rather a <PB N="178" REF="199"> rapacious
dependant. The coar&s;ene&s;s of its hair, and the thickne&s;s of its hide,
together with the thick coat of fat that lies immediately under the &s;kin,
render it in&s;en&s;ible to blows, or rough u&s;age. Mice have been known to
burrow in the back of the&s;e animals while fat|tening in the &s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, without their &s;eeming to perceive
it. Their other &s;en&s;es &s;eem to be in tolerable perfection; they &s;cent
the hounds at a di&s;tance; and, as we have &s;een, they are not in&s;en&s;ible
in the choice of their provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The hog is, by nature, &s;tupid, inactive, and drow&s;y; if
undi&s;turbed, it would &s;leep half its time; but it is frequently awaked by
the calls of appetite, which when it has &s;atisfied, it goes to re&s;t again.
Its whole life is thus a round of &s;leep and gluttony; and if &s;upplied with
&s;ufficient food, it &s;oon grows unfit even for its own ex|i&s;tence; its
fle&s;h becomes a greater load than its legs are able to &s;upport, and it
continues to feed lying down, or kneeling, an helple&s;s in&s;tance of indulged
&s;en&s;uality. The only time it &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ions of a more active
nature, are, when it is incited by venery, or when the wind blows with any
vehemence. Upon this occa&s;ion, it is &s;o agitated as to run violently
towards its &s;ty, &s;creaming horribly at the &s;ame time, which &s;eems 
<PB N="179" REF="200"> to argue that it is naturally fond of a warm cli|mate.
It appears al&s;o to fore&s;ee the approach of bad weather, bringing &s;traw to
its &s;ty in its mouth, preparing a bed, and hiding it&s;elf from the impending
&s;torm. Nor is it le&s;s agitated when it hears any of its kind in
di&s;tre&s;s: when a hog is caught in a gate, as is often the ca&s;e, or when
it &s;uffers any of the u&s;ual dome&s;tic ope|rations of ringing or &s;paying,
all the re&s;t are then &s;een to gather round it, to lend their fruit|le&s;s
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to &s;ympathize with its &s;uffer|ings. They have often
al&s;o been known to gather round a dog that had teazed them, and kill him upon
the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of this animal ari&s;e from intemperance;
mea&s;les, impo&s;thumes, and &s;cro|phulous &s;wellings, are reckoned among
the number. It is thought by &s;ome that they wal|low in the mire to de&s;troy
a &s;ort of lou&s;e or in|&s;ect that is often found to infe&s;t them; however,
they are generally known to live, when &s;o per|mitted, to eighteen or twenty
years; and the females produce till the age of fifteen. As they produce from
ten to twenty young at a litter, and that twice a year, we may ea&s;ily compute
how numerous they would &s;hortly become, if not dimini&s;hed by human
indu&s;try. In the wild &s;tate they are le&s;s prolific; and the &s;ow of the 
<PB N="180" REF="201"> woods brings forth but once a year, probably becau&s;e
exhau&s;ted by rearing up her former numerous progeny.</P>
<P>It would be &s;uperfluous to dwell longer upon the nature and
qualities of an animal too well known to need a de&s;cription: there are few,
even in cities, who are unacquainted with its u&s;es, its appetites, and way of
living. The arts of fattening, rearing, guarding, and ma|naging hogs, fall more
properly under the cognizance of the farmer than the naturali&s;t; they make a
branch of dome&s;tic oeconomy, which, properly treated, may be extended to a
great length: but the hi&s;tory of nature ought always to end where that of art
begins. It will be &s;ufficient, therefore, to ob&s;erve that the wild boar was
formerly a native of our country, as appears from the laws of Hoeldda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol. 1. p. 44.</BIBL></NOTE>, the
famous Welch legi&s;lator, who permitted his grand hunt&s;man to chace that
animal from the the middle of November to the beginning of December. William
the Conqueror al&s;o pu|ni&s;hed &s;uch as were convicted of killing the wild
boar in his fore&s;ts, with the lo&s;s of their eyes. At pre&s;ent, the whole
wild breed is extinct; but no country makes greater u&s;e of the tame kinds, as
their fle&s;h, which bears &s;alt better <PB N="181" REF="202"> than that of
any other animal, makes a principal part of the provi&s;ions of the Briti&s;h
Navy.</P>
<P>As this animal is a native of almo&s;t every country, there are
&s;ome varieties found in the &s;pecies. That which we call the Ea&s;t-India
breed, is lower, le&s;s furni&s;hed with hair, is u&s;ually black, and has the
belly almo&s;t touching the ground; it is now common in England, to fatten more
ea&s;ily than the ordinary kinds, and to make better bacon.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable variety of this animal about Up&s;al<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amaenit Accad. vol. v. p. 465.</BIBL></NOTE>,
which is &s;ingle hoofed, like the hor&s;e; but in no other re&s;pect differing
from the common kinds. The authority of Ari&s;totle, who fir&s;t made mention
of this kind, has been often called in que&s;tion; &s;ome have a&s;&s;erted,
that &s;uch a quadrupede never exi&s;ted, becau&s;e it happened not to fall
within the &s;phere of their own confined ob&s;ervation; however, at pre&s;ent,
the animal is too well known to admit of any doubt concerning it. The hog
common in Guinea differs al&s;o in &s;ome things from our own: though &s;haped
exactly as ours, it is of a reddi&s;h colour, with long ears, which end in a
&s;harp point, and a tail which hangs down to the pa&s;|tern; the whole body is
covered with &s;hort red &s;hining hair, without any bri&s;tles, but pretty 
<PB N="182" REF="203"> long near the tail. Their fle&s;h is &s;aid to be
ex|cellent, and they are very tame.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, from their near re&s;emblance to the hog, may be
con&s;idered as of the &s;ame &s;pecies; the Ea&s;t-Indian hog, we well know,
breeds with the common kind; whether the &s;ame ob|tains between it, and
tho&s;e of Up&s;al and Guinea, we cannot directly affirm; but where the
ex|ternal &s;imilitude is &s;o &s;trong, we may be induced to believe, that the
appetites and habits are the &s;ame. It is true, we are told, that the Gui|nea
breed will not mix with ours, but keep &s;eparate, and herd only together:
however, this is no proof of their diver&s;ity, &s;ince every animal will
prefer its own likene&s;s in its mate; and they will only then mix with another
&s;ort, when deprived of the &s;ociety of their own. The&s;e, therefore, we may
con&s;ider as all of the hog kind; but there are other quadrupedes, that, in
general, re&s;emble this &s;pecies, which, never|thele&s;s, are very di&s;tinct
from them. Travellers, indeed, from their general form, or from their habits
and way of living, have been content to call the&s;e creatures hogs al&s;o; but
upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, their differences are found to be &s;uch as
entirely to &s;eparate the kinds, and make each a di&s;tinct animal by
it&s;elf.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="183" REF="204">
<HEAD>THE PECCARY, OR TAJACU.</HEAD>
<P>THAT animal which of all others mo&s;t re|&s;embles an hog, and
yet is of a formation very di&s;tinct from it, is called the Peccary, or
Tajacu. It is a native of America, and found there, in &s;uch numbers, that
they are &s;een in herds of &s;everal hundreds together, grazing among the
woods, and inoffen&s;ive, except when offended.</P>
<P>The Peccary at fir&s;t view re&s;embles a &s;mall hog; the form of
its body, the &s;hape of its head, the length of its &s;nout, and the form of
its legs, are entirely alike: however, when we come to examine it nearer, the
differences begin to appear. The body is not &s;o bulky; its legs not &s;o
long; its bri&s;tles much thicker and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the hog,
re&s;embling rather the quills of a porcupine, than hair; in&s;tead of a tail,
it has only got a little fle&s;hy protuberance, which does not even cover its
po&s;teriors; but that which is &s;till more extraordinary, and in which it
differs from all other quadrupedes what&s;oever, is, that it has got upon its
back a lump re&s;embling the navel in other animals which is found to
&s;eparate a liquor of a very &s;trong &s;mell. The Peccary is the only
creature that has tho&s;e kind of glands which di&s;charge the 
<PB N="184" REF="205"> mu&s;ky &s;ub&s;tance, on that part of its body. Some
have them under the belly, and others under the tail; but this creature, by a
conformation peculiar to it&s;elf, has them on its back. This lump, or navel,
is &s;ituated on that part of the back which is over the hinder legs; it is, in
general, &s;o covered with long bri&s;tles, that it cannot be &s;een, except
they be drawn a&s;ide. A &s;mall &s;pace then appears, that is almo&s;t bare,
and only be&s;et with a few &s;hort fine hairs. In the middle it ri&s;es like a
lump; and in this there is an orifice, into which one may thru&s;t a common
goo&s;e quill. This hole or bag is not above an inch in depth; and round it,
under the &s;kin, are &s;ituated a number of &s;mall glands, which di&s;til a
whiti&s;h liquor, which, in colour and &s;ub&s;tance, re&s;embles that obtained
from the civet animal. Perhaps it was this analogy, that led Dr. Ty&s;on to
&s;ay, that it &s;melt agreeably al&s;o, like that perfume. But this Mr. Buffon
ab&s;olutely denies; affirming, that the &s;mell is at every time, and in every
proportion, &s;trong and offen&s;ive; and to this I can add my own
te&s;ti|mony, if that able naturali&s;t &s;hould want a voucher.</P>
<P>But, to be more particular in the de&s;cription of the other parts
of this quadrupede; the colour of the body is grizly, and be&s;et with 
<PB N="185" REF="206"> bri&s;tles, thicker and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of a
common hog; though not near &s;o thick as tho&s;e of a porcupine, they
re&s;emble, in this re&s;pect, that they are variegated with black and white
rings. The belly is almo&s;t bare; and the &s;hort bri&s;tles on the &s;ides,
gradually encrea&s;e in length, as they approach the ridge of the back, where
&s;ome are five inches long. On the head al&s;o, between the ears, there is a
large tuft of bri&s;tles, that are chiefly black. The ears are about two inches
and an half long, and &s;tand upright; and the eyes re&s;emble tho&s;e of a
common hog, only they are &s;maller. From the lower corner of the eye to the
&s;nout, is u&s;ually &s;ix inches; and the &s;nout it&s;elf is like that of an
hog's, though it is but &s;mall. One &s;ide of the lower lip is generally
&s;mooth, by the rubbing of the tu&s;k of the upper jaw. The feet and hoofs are
perfectly like tho&s;e of a common hog; but, as was already ob&s;erved, it has
no tail. There are &s;ome anatomical differences in its internal &s;tructure,
from that of the common hog. Dr. Ty&s;on was led to &s;uppo&s;e, that it had
three &s;tomachs; whereas the hog has but one: however, in this he was
deceived, as Mr. Daubenton has plainly &s;hewn, that the &s;tomach is only
divided by two clo&s;ings, which gives it the appearance as if divided into
three; <PB N="186" REF="207"> and there is no conformation that prevents the
food in any part of it, from going or returning to any other.</P>
<P>The peccary may be tamed like the hog, and has pretty nearly the
&s;ame habits and na|tural inclinations. It feeds upon the &s;ame aliments; its
fle&s;h, though drier and leaner than that of the hog, is pretty good eating;
it is improved by ca&s;tration; and, when killed, not only the parts of
generation mu&s;t be taken in&s;tantly away, but al&s;o the navel on the back,
with all the glands that contribute to its &s;upply. If this operation be
deferred for only half an hour, the fle&s;h becomes utterly unfit to be
eaten.</P>
<P>The peccary is extremely numerous in all the parts of Southern
America. They go in herds of two or three hundred together; and unite, like
hogs, in each other's defence. They are particularly fierce when their young
are attemped to be taken from them. They &s;urround the plunderer, attack him
without fear, and frequently make his life pay the forfeit of his ra&s;hne&s;s.
When any of the natives are pur&s;ued by an herd in this manner, they
frequently climb a tree to avoid them; while the peccaries gather round the
root, threaten with their tu&s;ks, and their rough bri&s;tles &s;tanding erect,
as in the <PB N="187" REF="208"> hog kind, they a&s;&s;ume a very terrible
appear|ance. In this manner they remain at the foot of the tree for hours
together; while the hunter is obliged to wait patiently, and not without
apprehen&s;ions, until they think fit to retire.</P>
<P>The peccary is rather fond of the mountain|ous parts of the
country, than the lowlands; it &s;eems to delight neither in the mar&s;hes nor
the mud, like our hogs; it keeps among the woods, where it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon
wild fruits, roots, and vegetables; it is al&s;o an uncea&s;ing enemy to the
lizard, the toad, and all the &s;erpent kinds, with which the&s;e uncultivated
fore&s;ts abound. As &s;oon as it perceives a &s;erpent, or a viper, it at once
&s;eizes it with its fore hoofs and teeth, &s;kins it in an in&s;tant, and
devours the fle&s;h. This is often &s;een; and may, therefore, be rea|dily
credited: but as to its applying to a proper vegetable immediately after, as an
antidote to the poi&s;on of the animal it had devoured, this part of the
relation we may very well &s;u&s;pect. The fle&s;h, neither of the toad or
viper, as every one now knows, are poi&s;onous; and, therefore, there is no
need of a remedy again&s;t their venom. Ray gives no credit to either part of
the account; however, we can have no rea&s;on to di&s;believe that it feeds
upon toads and &s;erpents; it is only the making u&s;e of a vege|table 
<PB N="188" REF="209"> antidote, that appears improbable, and which perhaps had
its ri&s;e in the ignorance and credulity of the natives.</P>
<P>The peccary, like the hog, is very prolific; the young ones follow
the dam, and do not &s;eparate till they have come to perfection. If taken at
fir&s;t, they are very ea&s;ily tamed, and &s;oon lo&s;e all their natural
ferocity; however, they never &s;hew any remarkable &s;igns of docility, but
continue &s;tupid and rude, without attachment, or even &s;eeming to know the
hand that feeds them. They only continue to do no mi&s;chief; and they may be
permitted to run tame, without apprehending any dangerous con&s;equen|ces. They
&s;eldom &s;tray far from home; they return of them&s;elves to the &s;ty; and
do not quarrel among each other, except when they happen to be fed in common.
At &s;uch times, they have an angry kind of growl, much &s;tronger
and-har&s;her than that of an hog; but they are &s;eldom heard to &s;cream as
the former, only now and then, when frighted, or irritated, they have an abrupt
angry manner of blowing like the boar.</P>
<P>The peccary, though like the hog in &s;o many various re&s;pects,
is, neverthele&s;s, a very di&s;tinct race, and will not mix, nor produce an
inter|mediate breed. The European hog has been <PB REF="210">

tran&s;planted into America, and &s;uffered to run wild among the woods; it is
often &s;een to herd among a drove of peccaries, but never to breed from them.
They may, therefore, be con&s;idered as two di&s;tinct creatures; the hog is
the larger, and the more u&s;eful animal; the peccary, more feeble and local;
the hog &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in mo&s;t parts of the world, and in almo&s;t every
climate; the peccary is a native of the warmer regions, and cannot
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in ours, without &s;helter and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is more than
probable, however, that we could readily propagate the breed of this
quadrupede, and that, in two or three ge|nerations, it might be familiarized to
our climate: but as it is inferior to the hog, in every re&s;pect, &s;o it
would be needle&s;s to admit a new dome&s;tic, who&s;e &s;ervices are better
&s;up|plied in the old.</P>

<HEAD>THE CAPIBARA, OR CABIAI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome quadrupedes &s;o entirely different from any that
we are acquainted with, that it is hard to find a well known animal to which to
re&s;emble them. In this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t be content to place them near &s;uch
as they mo&s;t approach in form and habits, &s;o that the reader may at once
have &s;ome idea of the creature's <PB N="190" REF="214"> &s;hape or
di&s;po&s;ition, although, perhaps, an in|adequate and a very confu&s;ed
one.</P>
<P>Upon that confu&s;ed idea, however, it will be our bu&s;ine&s;s to
work; to bring it, by degrees, to greater preci&s;ion; to mark out the
differences of form, and thus give the cleare&s;t notions that words can
ea&s;ily convey. The known animal is a kind of rude &s;ketch of the figure we
want to exhibit; from which, by degrees, we fa&s;hion out the &s;hape of the
creature we de&s;ire &s;hould be known; as a &s;tatuary &s;eldom begins his
work, till the rude outline of the figure is given by &s;ome other
hand.&mdash;In this manner, I have placed the Capibara among the hog kind,
merely becau&s;e it is more like an hog than any other animal commonly known,
and yet, more clo&s;ely examined, it will be found to differ in &s;ome of the
mo&s;t obvious particulars.</P>
<P>The Capibara re&s;embles an hog of about two years old, in the
&s;hape of its body, and the coar&s;ene&s;s and colour of its hair. Like the
hog, it has a thick &s;hort neck, and a rounded bri&s;tly back; like the hog,
it is fond of the water and mar&s;hy places, brings forth many at a time, and,
like it, feeds upon animal and ve|getable food. But, when examined more nearly,
the differences are many and obvious. The head is longer, the eyes are larger,
and the <PB N="191" REF="215"> &s;nout, in&s;tead of being rounded, as in the
hog, is &s;plit, like that of a rabbit or hare, and fur|ni&s;hed with thick
&s;trong whi&s;kers; the mouth is not &s;o wide, the number and the form of the
teeth are different, for it is without tu&s;ks: like the peccary, it wants a
tail; and, unlike to all others of this kind, in&s;tead of a cloven hoof, it is
in a manner web-footed, and thus entirely fitted for &s;wimming and living in
the water. The hoofs before are divided into four parts; and tho&s;e behind,
into three; between the divi&s;ions, there is a prolongation of the &s;kin,
&s;o that the foot, when &s;pread in &s;wim|ming, can beat a greater &s;urface
of water.</P>
<P>As its feet are thus made for the water, &s;o it is &s;een to
delight entirely in that element; and &s;ome naturali&s;ts have called it the
Water-hog for that rea&s;on. It is a native of South America, and is chiefly
&s;een frequenting the borders of lakes and rivers, like the otter. It &s;eizes
the fi&s;h upon which it preys, with its hoofs and teeth, and carries them to
the edge of the lake, to devour them at its ea&s;e. It lives al&s;o upon
fruits, corn, and &s;ugar-canes. As its legs are long and broad, it is often
&s;een &s;itting up, like a dog that is taught to beg. Its cry more nearly
re&s;embles the braying of an a&s;s, than the grunting of an hog. It &s;eldom
goes our, ex|cept <PB N="192" REF="216"> at night, and that always in company.
It never ventures far from the &s;ides of the river or the lake in which it
preys; for as it runs ill, becau&s;e of the length of its feet, and the
&s;hort|ne&s;s of its legs, &s;o its only place of &s;afety is the water, into
which it immediately plunges when pur&s;ued, and keeps &s;o long at the bottom,
that the hunter can have no hopes of taking it there. The Capibara, even in a
&s;tate of wildne&s;s, is of a gentle nature, and, when taken young, is
ea&s;ily tamed. It comes and goes at command, and even &s;hews an attachment to
its keeper. Its fle&s;h is &s;aid to be fat and tender, but, from the nature of
its food, it has a fi&s;hy ta&s;te, like that of all tho&s;e which are bred in
the water. Its head, however, is &s;aid to be excellent; and, in this, it
re&s;embles the beaver, who&s;e fore parts ta&s;te like fle&s;h, and the hinder
like the fi&s;h it feeds on.</P>

</FIGURE> <PB N="193" REF="221"> the hog kind, and may have induced
them to rank it among the number: however, when they come to its de&s;cription,
they repre&s;ent it as having neither the hair, the bri&s;tles, the head, the
&s;tature, nor the tail of an hog. Its legs, we are told, are longer, its
&s;nout &s;horter, its body more &s;lender, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of
a &s;tag; its hair is finer, of a grey colour, rather re&s;embling wool than
bri&s;tles, and its tail al&s;o tufted with the &s;ame. From the&s;e
va|rieties, therefore, it can &s;carcely be called an hog; and yet, in this
cla&s;s we mu&s;t be content to rank it until its form and nature come to be
better known. What we at pre&s;ent prin|cipally di&s;tingui&s;h it by are four
enormous tu&s;ks, that grow out of each jaw; the two large&s;t from the upper,
and the two &s;malle&s;t from the under. The jaw-bones of this extraordinary
animal are found to be very thick and &s;trong; from whence the&s;e mon&s;trous
tu&s;ks are &s;een to proceed, that di&s;tingui&s;h it from all other
quadrupedes what|&s;oever. The two that go from the lower jaw are not above a
foot long, but tho&s;e of the upper are above half a yard: as in the boar, they
bend circularly, and the two lower &s;tand in the jaw as they are &s;een to do
in that animal; but the two upper ri&s;e from the upper jaw, rather like horns
than teeth; and, bending up|wards <PB N="194" REF="222"> and backwards,
&s;ometimes have their points directed to the animal's eyes, and are often
fatal by growing into them. Were it not that the Babyroue&s;&s;a has two &s;uch
large teeth underneath, we might ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e the two upper to be
horns; and, in fact, their &s;ockets are directed upwards; for which rea&s;on
Doctor Grew was of that opinion. But, as the teeth of both jaws are of the
&s;ame con&s;i&s;tence, and as they both grow out of &s;ockets in the &s;ame
manner, the analogy between both is too &s;trong not to &s;uppo&s;e them of the
&s;ame nature. The upper teeth, when they leave the &s;ocket, im|mediately
pierce the upper lips of the animal, and grow as if they immediately went from
its cheek. The tu&s;ks in both jaws are of a very fine ivory, &s;moother and
whiter than that of the elephant, but not &s;o hard or &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The&s;e enormous tu&s;ks give this animal a very formidable
appearance; and yet it is thought to be much le&s;s dangerous than the wild
boar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxv. p. 179.</BIBL></NOTE>.
Like animals of the hog kind, they go together in a body, are often &s;een in
company with the wild boar, with which, however, they are never known to
engender. They have a very &s;trong &s;cent, which di&s;covers them to the
hounds; and, when pur&s;ued, they growl dreadfully, often turn|ing 
<PB N="195" REF="223"> back upon the dogs, and wounding them with the tu&s;ks
of the lower jaw, for tho&s;e of the upper are rather an ob&s;truction than a
defence. They run much &s;wifter than the boar, and have a more exqui&s;ite
&s;cent, winding the men and the dogs at a great di&s;tance. When hunted
clo&s;ely, they generally plunge them&s;elves into the &s;ea, where they &s;wim
with great &s;wiftne&s;s and facility, diving, and ri&s;ing again at
plea|&s;ure; and in this manner they mo&s;t frequently e&s;cape their
pur&s;uers. Although fierce and ter|rible when offended, yet they are peaceable
and harmle&s;s when unmole&s;ted. They are ea&s;ily tamed, and their fle&s;h is
good to be eaten; but it is &s;aid to putrefy in a very &s;hort time. They have
a way of repo&s;ing them&s;elves different from mo&s;t other animals of the
larger kind; which is by hitching one of their upper tu&s;ks on the branch of a
tree, and then &s;uffering their whole body to &s;wing down at ea&s;e. Thus
&s;u&s;|pended from a tooth, they continue the whole night quite &s;ecure, and
out of the reach of &s;uch animals as hunt them for prey.</P>
<P>The Babyroue&s;&s;a, though by its teeth and tu&s;ks it &s;eems
fitted for a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, and probably is carnivorous, yet,
neverthele&s;s, &s;eems chiefly to live upon vegetables and the leaves of
trees. It &s;eldom &s;eeks to break into <PB N="196" REF="224"> gardens, like
the boar, in order to pillage the more &s;ucculent productions of human
indu&s;try, but lives remote from mankind, content with coar&s;er fare and
&s;ecurity. It has been &s;aid that it was only to be found in the i&s;land of
Borneo, but this is a mi&s;take, as it is well known in many other parts, both
of A&s;ia and Africa, as at the Celebes, at E&s;trila, Senegal, and
Ma|daga&s;car<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ander&s;on's Natural Hi&s;tory of
Greenland.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such are the animals of the hog kind, which are not di&s;tinctly
known; and even all the&s;e, as we &s;ee, have been but imperfectly examined,
or de&s;cribed. There are &s;ome others of which we have &s;till more imperfect
notices; &s;uch as the Warree, an hog of the i&s;thmus of Darien, de&s;cribed
by Wafer, with large tu&s;ks and &s;mall ears, and bri&s;tles like a coar&s;e
fur all over the body. This, however, may be the European hog, which has run
wild in that part of the new world, as no other traveller has taken no|tice of
the &s;ame. The Canary boar &s;eems dif|ferent from other animals of this kind,
by the largene&s;s of its tu&s;ks; and, as is judged from the &s;keleton, by
the apperture of its no&s;trils, and the number of its grinders. I cannot
con|clude this account of tho&s;e animals that are thus furni&s;hed with
enormous tu&s;ks, without <PB N="197" REF="225"> ob&s;erving that there is a
&s;trong con&s;ent between the&s;e and the parts of generation. When
ca|&s;trated, it is well known that the tu&s;ks grow much &s;maller, and are
&s;carce &s;een to appear without the lips; but what is &s;till more
remark|able, is, that in a boar, if the tu&s;ks by any ac|cident or de&s;ign be
broke away, the animal abates of its fiercene&s;s and venery, and it pro|duces
nearly the &s;ame effect upon its con&s;ti|tution as if ca&s;tration had
actually taken place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Li&s;le's Hu&s;bandry, vol.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Animals of the Cat Kind.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto been de&s;cribing a cla&s;s of peaceful and
harmle&s;s animals, that &s;erve as the in&s;truments of man's happine&s;s, or
at lea&s;t that do not openly oppo&s;e him. We come now to a bloody and
unrelenting tribe, that di&s;dain to own his power, and carry on uncea&s;ing
ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t him. All the cla&s;s of the cat kind are chiefly
di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;harp and for|midable claws, which they can hide
and extend at plea&s;ure. They lead a &s;olitary ravenous life, neither uniting
for their mutual defence, like vegetable feeders, nor for their mutual
&s;upport, like tho&s;e of the dog kind. The whole of this cruel and ferocious
tribe &s;eek their food alone; and, except at certain &s;ea&s;ons, are even
enemies to each other. The dog, the wolf, and the bear, are &s;ometimes known
to live upon vege|table or farinaceous food; but all of the cat kind, &s;uch as
the lion, the tiger, the leopard, and the ounce, devour nothing but fle&s;h,
and &s;tarve upon any other provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>They are, in general, fierce, rapacious, &s;ubtle and cruel, unfit
for &s;ociety among each other, and incapable of adding to human hap|pine&s;s. 
<PB N="199" REF="227"> However, it is probable that even the fierce&s;t could
be rendered dome&s;tic, if man thought the conque&s;t worth the trouble. Lions
have been yoked to the chariots of conquerors, and tigers have been taught to
tend tho&s;e herds which they are known at pre&s;ent to de&s;troy; but the&s;e
&s;ervices are not &s;ufficient to recom|pence for the trouble of their
keeping; &s;o that cea&s;ing to be u&s;eful, they continue to be nox|ious, and
become rebellious &s;ubjects becau&s;e not taken under equal protection with
the re&s;t of the brute creation.</P>
<P>Other tribes of animals are cla&s;&s;ed with dif|ficulty; have often
but few points of re|&s;emblance; and, though alike in form, have different
di&s;po&s;itions, and different appetites. But all tho&s;e of the cat kind,
although differing in &s;ize, or in colour, are yet nearly allied to each
other; being equally fierce, ra|pacious, and artful; and he that has &s;een one
has &s;een all. In other creatures there are many changes wrought by human
a&s;&s;iduity; the dog, the hog, or the &s;heep, are altered in their na|tures
and forms, ju&s;t as the nece&s;&s;ities or the caprice of mankind have found
fitting; but all of this kind are inflexible in their forms, and wear the print
of their natural wildne&s;s &s;trong upon them. The dogs or cows vary in
dif|ferent <PB N="200" REF="228"> countries, but lions or tigers are &s;till
found the &s;ame; the very colour is nearly alike in all; and the &s;lighte&s;t
alterations are &s;ufficient to make a difference in the kinds, and to give the
animal a different denomination.</P>
<P>The cat kind are not le&s;s remarkable for the &s;harpne&s;s and
&s;trength of their claws, which thru&s;t forth from their &s;heath when they
&s;eize their prey, than for the &s;hortne&s;s of their &s;nout, the
roundne&s;s of their head, and the large whi&s;kers which grow on the upper
lip. Their teeth al&s;o, which amount to the number of thirty, are very
formidable; but are rather cal|culated for tearing their prey than for chewing
it; for this rea&s;on they feed but &s;lowly; and while they eat, generally
continue growling, to deter others from taking a &s;hare. In the dog kind, the
chief power lies in the under jaw, which is long, and furni&s;hed with
mu&s;cles of amazing &s;trength; but in the&s;e the greate&s;t force lies in
the claws, which are extended with great ea&s;e, and their gripe is &s;o
tenacious that nothing can open it. The hinder parts in all the&s;e animals are
much weaker than tho&s;e before; and they &s;eem le&s;s made for &s;trength
than agility. Nor are they endued with the &s;wiftne&s;s of mo&s;t other
animals; but generally owe their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence rather to catching their
prey by &s;urprize than <PB N="201" REF="229"> by hunting it fairly down. They
all &s;eize it with a bound, at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing their fierce
plea&s;ure with a roar; and their fir&s;t gra&s;p generally di&s;ables the
captive from all further re&s;i&s;tance. With all the&s;e qualifications for
&s;laughter, they neverthele&s;s &s;eem timid and cowardly, and &s;eldom make
an attack, like tho&s;e of the dog kind, at a di&s;advantage: on the contrary,
they fly when the force again&s;t them is &s;uperior, or even equal to their
own; and the lion him&s;elf will not venture to make a &s;econd attempt, where
he has been once re|pul&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. For this rea&s;on, in countries
that are tolerably inhabited, the lion is &s;o cowardly, that he is often
&s;cared away by the cries of women and children.</P>
<P>The cat, which is the &s;malle&s;t animal of this kind, is the only
one that has been taken under human protection, and may be con&s;idered as a
faithle&s;s friend, brought to oppo&s;e a &s;till more in&s;idious enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This de&s;cription is nearly tran&s;lated from Mr. Buffon: what is
added by me, is marked with inverted commas.</NOTE>. It is, in fact, the only
animal of this tribe who&s;e &s;ervices can more than recompence the trouble of
their edu|cation, and who&s;e &s;trength is not &s;ufficient to make its anger
formidable. The lion or the tiger may ea&s;ily be tamed, and rendered
&s;ub|&s;ervient <PB N="202" REF="230"> to human command; but even in their
humble&s;t, and mo&s;t familiar moments, they are &s;till dangerous; &s;ince
their &s;trength is &s;uch, that the &s;malle&s;t fit of anger or caprice may
have dreadful con&s;equences. But the cat, though ea&s;ily offended, and often
capricious in her re|&s;entments, is not endued with powers &s;ufficient to do
any great mi&s;chief. Of all animals, when young, there is none more prettily
playful than the kitten; but it &s;eems to lo&s;e this di&s;po&s;ition as it
grows old, and the innate treachery of its kind is then &s;een to prevail. From
being na|turally ravenous, education teaches it to di&s;|gui&s;e its appetites,
and to watch the favourable moment of plunder; &s;upple, in&s;inuating, and
artful, it has learned the arts of concealing its intentions till it can put
them into execution; when the opportunity offers, it at once &s;eizes upon
whatever it finds, flies off with it, and continues at a di&s;tance till it
&s;uppo&s;es its offence forgotten. The cat has only the appearance of
attachment; and it may ea&s;ily be perceived, by its timid approaches, and
&s;ide-long looks, that it either dreads its ma&s;ter, or di&s;tru&s;ts his
kindne&s;s: different from the dog, who&s;e care&s;&s;es are &s;incere, the cat
is a&s;&s;iduous rather for its own plea&s;ure, than to plea&s;e; and often
gains confidence, only to abu&s;e it. The form of its <PB N="203" REF="231">
body, and its temperament, corre&s;pond with its di&s;po&s;ition; active,
cleanly, delicate, and vo|luptuous, it loves its ea&s;e, and &s;eeks the
&s;ofte&s;t cu&s;hions to lie on. 
<Q REND="inline">"Many of its habits, how|ever, are rather the
con&s;equences of its for|mation, than the re&s;ult of any perver&s;ene&s;s in
its di&s;po&s;ition; it is timid and mi&s;tru&s;tful, be|cau&s;e its body is
weak, and its &s;kin tender; a blow hurts it infinitely more than it does a
dog, who&s;e hide is thick and body mu&s;cular; the long fur in which the cat
is cloathed, entirely di&s;gui&s;es its &s;hape, which, if &s;een naked, is
long, feeble, and &s;lender; it is not to be wondered, therefore, that it
appears much more fearful of cha&s;ti&s;ement than the dog, and often flies,
even when no correction is intended. Being al&s;o the native of the warmer
climates, as will be &s;hewn hereafter, it chu&s;es the &s;ofte&s;t bed to lie
on, which is always the warme&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>The cat goes with young fifty-&s;ix days, and &s;eldom brings forth
above five or &s;ix at a time. The female u&s;ually hides the place of her
re|treat from the male, who is often found to devour her kittens. She feeds
them for &s;ome weeks with her milk, and whatever &s;mall ani|mals &s;he can
take by &s;urprize, accu&s;toming them betimes to rapine. Before they are a
year old, they are &s;it to engender; the female <PB N="204" REF="232"> &s;eeks
the male with cries; nor is their copu|lation performed without great pain,
from the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age in the female. They live to about the
age of ten years; and, during that period, they are extremely vivacious,
&s;uf|fering to be worried a long time before they die.</P>
<P>The young kittens are very playful and amu&s;ing; but their &s;port
&s;oon turns into malice, and they, from the beginning, &s;hew a
di&s;po&s;i|tion to cruelty; they often look wi&s;tfully towards the cage,
&s;it centinels at the mouth of a mou&s;e-hole, and, in a &s;hort time, become
more expert hunters, than if they had received the in&s;tructions of art.
Indeed, their di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o incapable of con&s;traint, that all
in&s;truction would be but thrown away. It is true, that we are told of the
Greek monks of the i&s;le of Cyprus, teaching cats to hunt the &s;erpents with
which the i&s;land is infe&s;ted; but this may be natural to the animal
it&s;elf, and they might have fallen upon &s;uch a pur&s;uit without any
in&s;truc|tion. Whatever animal is much weaker than them&s;elves, is to them an
indi&s;criminate object of de&s;truction. Birds, young rabbits, hares, rats and
mice, bats, moles, toads and frogs, are all equally pur&s;ued; though not,
perhaps, equally acceptable. The mou&s;e &s;eems to be <PB N="205" REF="233">
their favourite game; and, although the cat has the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling in
but a mean degree, it, neverthele&s;s, knows tho&s;e holes in which its prey
re&s;ides. I have &s;een one of them patiently watch an whole day until the
mou&s;e appeared, and continue quite motionle&s;s until it came within reach,
and then &s;eized it with a jump. Of all the marks by which the cat di&s;covers
its natural malignity, that of playing and &s;porting with its little captive
before killing it outright, is the mo&s;t flagrant.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination which they di&s;cover for this peculiar manner
of pur&s;uit, ari&s;es from the conformation of their eyes. The pupil in man,
and in mo&s;t other animals, is capable but of a &s;mall degree of contraction
and dilatation, it enlarges a little in the dark, and contracts when the light
pours in upon it, in too great quantities. In the eyes of cats, however, this
contraction and dilatation of the pupil, is &s;o con&s;iderable, that the
pupil, which by day-light appears narrow and &s;mall, like the black of ones
nail, by night expands over the whole &s;urface of the eye-ball, and, as every
one mu&s;t have &s;een, their eyes &s;eem on fire. By this peculiar
conformation, their eyes &s;ee better in darkne&s;s than light; and the animal
is thus <PB N="206" REF="234"> better adapted for &s;pying out and &s;urprizing
its prey.</P>
<P>Although the cat is an inhabitant of our hou&s;es, yet it cannot
properly be called a dependant; although perfectly tame, yet it acknowledges no
obedience; on the contrary, it does only ju&s;t what it thinks fit, and no art
can controul any of its inclinations. In general, it is but half tamed; and has
its attachments rather to the place in which it re&s;ides, than to the
inhabitant. If the inhabitant quits the hou&s;e, the cat &s;till remains; and
if carried el&s;ewhere, &s;eems for a while bewildered with its new
&s;itu|ation. It mu&s;t take time to become acquainted with the holes and
retreats in which its prey re&s;ides, with all the little labyrinths through
which they often make good an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The cat is particularly fearful of water, of cold, and of ill
&s;mells. It loves to keep in the &s;un, to get near the fire, and to rub
it&s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e who carry perfumes. It is exce&s;|&s;ively fond of
&s;ome plants, &s;uch as valerian, marum, and cat-mint: again&s;t the&s;e it
rubs, &s;mells them at a di&s;tance, and, at la&s;t, if they be planted in a
garden, wears them out.</P>
<P>This animal eats &s;lowly, and with difficulty, as its teeth are
rather made for tearing, than <PB N="207" REF="235"> chewing its aliments. For
this rea&s;on, it loves the mo&s;t tender food, particularly fi&s;h, which it
eats as well boiled as raw. Its &s;leeping is very light; and it often &s;eems
to &s;leep, the better to deceive its prey. When the cat walks, it treads very
&s;oftly, and without the lea&s;t noi&s;e; and as to the nece&s;&s;ities of
nature, it is cleanly to the la&s;t degree. Its fur al&s;o is u&s;ually &s;leek
and glo&s;&s;y; and, for this rea&s;on, the hair is ea&s;ily electrified,
&s;ending forth &s;hining &s;parks, if rubbed in the dark.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The wild cat breeds with the tame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>; and, therefore, the latter
may be con&s;idered only as a variety of the former: however, they differ in
&s;ome particulars; the cat, in its &s;avage &s;tate, is &s;omewhat larger than
the hou&s;e-cat; and its fur being longer, gives it a greater appearance than
it really has; its head is bigger, and face flatter; the teeth and claws much
more formi|dable; its mu&s;cles very &s;trong, as being formed for rapine; the
tail is of a moderate length, but very thick and flat, marked with alternate
bars of black and white, the end always black; the hips and hind part of the
lower joints of the leg, are always black; the fur is very &s;oft and fine: the
general colour of the&s;e animals, in England, is a yellowi&s;h white, mixed
with a <PB N="208" REF="236"> deep grey. The&s;e colours, though they appear at
fir&s;t &s;ight confu&s;edly blended together, yet, on a clo&s;e in&s;pection,
will be found to be di&s;po&s;ed like the &s;treaks on the &s;kin of the tiger,
pointing from the back downwards, ri&s;ing from a black li&s;t, that runs from
the head, along the middle of the back, to the tail. This animal is found in
our larger woods; and is the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of the carnivorous kinds in
this kingdom. It inhabits the mo&s;t mountainous and woody parts of the&s;e
i&s;lands, living mo&s;tly in trees, and feeding only by night. It often
happens, that the females of the tame kind go into the woods to &s;eek mates
among the wild ones. It &s;hould &s;eem, that the&s;e, however, are not
original inhabitants of this kingdom, but were introduced fir&s;t in a
dome&s;tic &s;tate, and afterwards became wild in the woods, by ill u&s;age or
neglect. Certain it is, the cat was an animal much higher in e&s;teem among our
ance&s;tors than it is at pre&s;ent. By the laws of Howel, the price of a
kitten, before it could &s;ee, was to be a penny; till it caught a mou&s;e, two
pence; and, when it commenced mou&s;er, four pence: it was required, be&s;ides,
that it &s;hould be perfect in its &s;en&s;es of hearing and &s;eeing, be a
good mou&s;er, have the claws whole, and be a good nur&s;e. If it failed in any
of <PB N="209" REF="237"> the&s;e qualities, the &s;eller was to forfeit to the
buyer the third part of its value. If any one &s;tole or killed the cat that
guarded the prince's granary, he was to forfeit a milch ewe, its fleece and
lamb, or as much wheat as, when poured on the cat &s;u&s;pended by the tail
(the head touching the floor) would form an heap high enough to cover the tip
of the former. From hence we di&s;cover, be&s;ides a picture of the
&s;implicity of the times, a &s;trong argument that cats were not naturally
bred in our fore&s;ts. An animal that could be &s;o ea&s;ily taken, could never
have been rated &s;o highly; and the pre|cautions laid down to improve the
breed, would have been &s;uperfluous, in a creature that multiplies to &s;uch
an amazing degree. 
<P>"In our climate, we know but of one variety of the wild cat;
and, from the accounts of travellers, we learn, that there are but very few
differences in this quadrupede in all parts of the world. The greate&s;t
difference, indeed, between the wild and the tame cat, is rather to be found
internally than in their outward form. Of all other quadrupedes, the wild cat
is, perhaps, that who&s;e inte&s;tines are proportionably the &s;malle&s;t and
the &s;horte&s;t. The inte&s;tines of the &s;heep, for in&s;tance, unravelled
out, and mea&s;ured according to their length, will be <PB N="210" REF="238">
found to be above thirty times the length of its body; whereas, the wild cat's
inte&s;tines, being mea&s;ured out, will not be found above three times the
length of its body. This is a &s;urprizing difference; but we may account for
it, from the nature of the food in the two animals; the one living upon
vegetables, which requires a longer, and a more tedious preparation, before
they can become a part of its body; the other, living upon fle&s;h, which
requires very little alteration, in order to be a&s;&s;imilated into the
&s;ub&s;tance of the creature that feeds upon it. The one, therefore, wanted a
long canal for the properly dige&s;ting and &s;training its food; the other,
but a &s;hort one, as the food is already prepared to pa&s;s the u&s;ual
&s;ecretions: however, a difficulty &s;till remains behind; the inte&s;tines of
the wild cat are, by one third, &s;horter than tho&s;e of the tame. How can we
account for this? If we &s;ay that the dome&s;tic cat, living upon more
nouri&s;hing and more plentiful pro|vi&s;ion, has its inte&s;tines enlarged to
the quantity with which it is &s;upplied, we &s;hall find this ob&s;ervation
contradicted in the wild boar and the wolf, who&s;e inte&s;tines are as long as
tho&s;e of the hog or the dog, and yet they lead a &s;avage life, and, like the
wild cat, are fed by precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The &s;hortne&s;s,
there|fore, <PB N="211" REF="239"> of the wild cat's inte&s;tines, is &s;till
un|accounted for; and mo&s;t naturali&s;ts con&s;ider the difficulty as
inextricable. We mu&s;t leave it, therefore, as one of tho&s;e difficulties
which future ob&s;ervation or accident are mo&s;t likely to
di&s;cover."</P></Q></P>
<P>This animal is one of tho&s;e few which are common to the new
continent, as well as the old. When Chri&s;topher Columbus fir&s;t
di&s;|covered that country, an hunter brought him one, which he had
di&s;covered in the woods, which was of the ordinary &s;ize, the tail very long
and thick. They were common al&s;o in Peru, although they were not rendered
dome&s;tic. They are well known al&s;o in &s;everal parts of Africa, and many
parts of A&s;ia. In &s;ome of the&s;e countries they are of a peculiar colour,
and inclining to blue. In Per&s;ia, Pietro della Valle informs us, that there
is a kind of cat, particularly in the province of Chorazan, of the figure and
form of the ordinary one, but infinitely more beautiful in the lu&s;tre and
colour of its &s;kin. It is of a grey blue, without mix|ture, and as &s;oft and
&s;hining as &s;ilk. The tail is very long, and covered with hair &s;ix inches
long, which the animal throws upon its back, like the &s;quirrel. The&s;e cats
are well known in France; and have been brought over into <PB N="212" REF="240"> England, under the name of the <HI>blue cat,</HI> which, however, is
not their colour.</P>
<P>Another variety of this animal is called by us the <HI>lion
cat</HI>; or, as others more properly term it, the Cat of Angora. The&s;e are
larger than the common cat, and even than the wild one. Their hair is much
longer, and hangs about their head and neck, giving this creature the
appearance of a lion. Some of the&s;e are white, and others of a dun colour.
The&s;e come from Syria and Per&s;ia, two countries which are noted for giving
a long &s;oft hair to the animals which are bred in them. The &s;heep, the
goats, the dogs and the rabbits of Syria, are all remarkable for the fine
glo&s;&s;y length and &s;oftne&s;s of their hair; but par|ticularly the cat,
who&s;e nature &s;eems to be &s;o inflexible, conforms to the nature of the
climate and &s;oil, lo&s;es its &s;avage colour, which it pre|&s;erves almo&s;t
in every other part of the world, and a&s;&s;umes the mo&s;t beautiful
appearance. There are &s;ome other varieties in this animal, but rather in
colour than in form; and, in ge|neral, it may be remarked, that the cat, when
carried into other countries, alters but very little, &s;till pre&s;erving its
natural manners, ha|bits and conformation.</P>

<PB N="214" REF="245"> the burning &s;un of Africa, is, of all others, the
mo&s;t terrible, the mo&s;t undaunted. The wolf or the dog, in&s;tead of
attempting to rival him, &s;carce de&s;erve to attend his motions, or become
his providers. Such, however, of the&s;e animals, as are bred in a more
temperate climate, or towards the tops of cold and lofty mountains, are far
more gentle, or, to &s;peak more properly, far le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e
bred in the torrid vallies beneath. The lions of Mount Atlas, the tops of which
are covered in eternal &s;nows, have neither the &s;trength nor the ferocity of
the lions of Bildul|gerid or Zaara, where the plains are covered with burning
&s;ands. It is particularly in the&s;e frightful de&s;erts, that tho&s;e
enormous and ter|rible bea&s;ts are found, that &s;eem to be the &s;courge and
the terror of the neighbouring kingdoms. Happily, indeed, the &s;pecies is not
very nu|merous; and it &s;eems to be dimini&s;hing daily; for tho&s;e who have
travelled through the&s;e countries, a&s;&s;ure us, that there are by no means
&s;o many there at pre&s;ent, as were known for|merly; and Mr. Shaw ob&s;erves,
that the Romans carried fifty times as many lions from Lybia, in one year, to
combat in their amphitheatres, as are to be found in the whole country at this
time. The &s;ame remark is made with regard <PB N="215" REF="246"> to Turky, to
Per&s;ia, and the Indies; where the lions are found to dimini&s;h in their
numbers every day. Nor is it difficult to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of this
diminution: it is obvious that it cannot be owing to the encrea&s;e of the
force of other quadrupedes, &s;ince they are all inferior to the lion, and,
con&s;equently, in&s;tead of le&s;|&s;ening the number, only tend to encrea&s;e
the &s;upplies on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t; it mu&s;t, there|fore, be
occa&s;ioned by the encrea&s;e of mankind, who is the only animal in nature
capable of making head again&s;t the&s;e tyrants of the fore&s;t, and
preventing their encrea&s;e. The arms even of an Hottentot or a Negroe make
them more than a match for this powerful creature; and they &s;eldom make the
attack, without coming off victorious. Their u&s;ual manner is to find out his
retreat, and, with &s;pears headed with iron, to provoke him to the combat:
four men are con&s;idered as &s;ufficient for this encounter; and he again&s;t
whom the lion flies, receives him upon his &s;pear, while the others attack him
behind; the lion, finding him&s;elf wounded in the rear, turns that way, and
thus gives the man he fir&s;t attacked, an opportunity to recover. In this
manner they attack him on all &s;ides; until, at la&s;t, they entirely
di&s;able, and then di&s;patch him. This &s;uperiority in the numbers, 
<PB N="216" REF="247"> and the arts of man, that are &s;ufficient to con|quer
the lion, &s;erve al&s;o to enervate and di&s;|courage him; for he is brave
only in proportion to the &s;ucce&s;s of his former encounters. In the va&s;t
de&s;erts of Zaara, in the burning &s;ands that lie between Mauritania and
Negroland, in the uninhabited countries that lie to the north of Cafraria, and,
in general, in all the de&s;erts of Africa, where man has not fixed his
habita|tion, the lions are found in great numbers, and pre&s;erve their natural
courage and force. Ac|cu&s;tomed to mea&s;ure their &s;trength with every
animal they meet, the habit of conquering ren|ders them intrepid and terrible.
Having never experienced the dangerous arts and combina|tions of man, they have
no apprehen&s;ions from his power. They boldly face him, and &s;eem to brave
the force of his arms. Wounds rather &s;erve to provoke their rage than
repre&s;s their ardour. They are not daunted even with the oppo&s;ition of
numbers; a &s;ingle lion of the de|&s;ert often attacks an entire caravan; and,
after an ob&s;tinate combat, when he finds him&s;elf overpowered, in&s;tead of
flying, he continues to combat, retreating, and &s;till facing the enemy till
he dies. On the contrary, the lions which inhabit the peopled countries of
Morocco or India, having become acquainted with human <PB N="217" REF="248">
power, and experienced man's &s;uperiority, have lo&s;t all their courage, &s;o
as to be &s;cared away with a &s;hout; and &s;eldom attack any but the
unre&s;i&s;ting flocks or herds, which even women and children are &s;ufficient
to protect.</P>
<P>This alteration in the lion's di&s;po&s;ition &s;uf|ficiently
&s;hews that he might ea&s;ily be tamed, and admit of a certain degree of
educa|tion. 
<Q REND="inline">"In fact, nothing is more common than for the
keepers of wild bea&s;ts to play with this animal, to pull out his tongue, and
even to cha&s;ti&s;e him without a cau&s;e. He &s;eems to bear it all with the
utmo&s;t compo&s;ure; and we very rarely have in&s;tances of his reveng|ing
the&s;e unprovoked &s;allies of impertinent cruelty. However, when his anger is
at la&s;t excited, the con&s;equences are terrible. Labat tells us of a
gentleman who kept a lion in his chamber, and employed a &s;ervant to at|tend
it; who, as is u&s;ual, mix'd his blows with care&s;&s;es. This ill-judged
a&s;&s;ociation con|tinued for &s;ome time; till one morning the gentleman was
awakened by a noi&s;e in his room, which, at fir&s;t, he could not tell the
cau&s;e of; but, drawing the curtains, he per|ceived an horrid &s;pectacle; the
lion growling over the man's head, which he had &s;epa|rated from the body, and
to&s;&s;ing it round the <PB N="218" REF="249"> floor. He immediately,
therefore, flew into the next room, called to the people with|out, and had the
animal &s;ecured from doing further mi&s;chief."</Q> However, this &s;ingle
ac|count is not &s;ufficient to weigh again&s;t the many in&s;tances we every
day &s;ee of this creature's gentlene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He is often
bred up with other dome&s;tic animals, and is &s;een to play innocently and
familiarly among them; and, if it ever happens that his natural ferocity
returns, it is &s;eldom exerted again&s;t his bene|factors. As his pa&s;&s;ions
are &s;trong, and his appetites vehement, one ought not to pre&s;ume that the
impre&s;&s;ions of education will always prevail; &s;o that it would be
dangerous in &s;uch circum&s;tances to &s;uffer him to remain too long without
food, or to per&s;i&s;t in irritating and abu&s;ing him: however, numberle&s;s,
accounts a&s;&s;ure us that his anger is noble, his courage magnanimous, and
his di&s;po&s;ition grateful. He has been often &s;een to de&s;pi&s;e
contemptible enemies, and pardon their in&s;ults when it was in his power to
puni&s;h them. He has been &s;een to &s;pare the lives of &s;uch as were thrown
to be devoured by him, to live peaceably with them, to afford them a part of
his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and &s;ometimes to want food him&s;elf rather than
de|prive them of that life which his genero&s;ity had &s;pared.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="250">It may al&s;o be &s;aid that the lion is not
cruel, &s;ince he is &s;o only from nece&s;&s;ity, and never kills more than he
con&s;umes. When &s;atiated, he is perfectly gentle; while the tiger, the wolf,
and all the inferior kinds, &s;uch as the fox, the pole-cat, and the ferret,
kill without remor&s;e, are fierce without cau&s;e, and, by their
indi&s;|criminate &s;laughter, &s;eem rather to &s;atisfy their malignity than
their hunger.</P>
<P>The outward form of the lion &s;eems to &s;peak his internal
genero&s;ity. His figure is &s;triking, his look confident and bold, his gait
proud, and his voice terrible. His &s;ta|ture is not overgrown, like that of
the ele|phant, or rhinoceros; nor is his &s;hape clum&s;y, like that of the
hippopotamos, or the ox. It is compact, well proportioned, and &s;izeable; a
perfect model of &s;trength joined with agility. It is mu&s;cular and bold,
neither charged with fat or unnece&s;&s;ary fle&s;h. It is &s;ufficient but to
&s;ee him in order to be a&s;&s;ured of his &s;uperior force. His large head
&s;urrounded with a dread|ful mane; all tho&s;e mu&s;cles that appear under the
&s;kin &s;welling with the &s;lighte&s;t exertions; and the great breadth of
his paws, with the thickne&s;s of his limbs, plainly evince that no other
animal in the fore&s;t is capable of oppo&s;|ing him. He has a very broad face
that, as &s;ome have imagined, re&s;embles the human. It <PB N="220" REF="251">
is &s;urrounded with very long hair, which gives it a very maje&s;tic air. The
top of the head, the temples, the cheeks, the under jaw, the neck, the
brea&s;t, the &s;houlder, the hinder part of the legs, and the belly, are
furni&s;hed with it, while all the re&s;t of the body is covered with very
&s;hort hair, of a tawny colour. 
<Q REND="inline">"The length of the hair in many parts, and the
&s;hort|ne&s;s of it in others, &s;erves a good deal to di&s;|gui&s;e this
animal's real figure. The brea&s;t, for in&s;tance, appears very broad, but in
reality it is as narrow and contracted in proportion as that of the generality
of dogs and hor&s;es. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the tail &s;eems to be of an
equal thickne&s;s from one end to the other, on account of the inequality of
the hair with which it is encom|pa&s;&s;ed; it being &s;horter near the
in&s;ertion where the fle&s;h and bones are large, and growing longer in
proportion as its real thickne&s;s le&s;&s;ens towards the point, where it ends
in a tuft. The hair about the neck and brea&s;t is not dif|ferent from that on
the re&s;t of the body, except in the length of it; nor is each hair pointed as
in mo&s;t other animals, but of an equal thick|ne&s;s from one end to the
other. The neck is very &s;trong, but not compo&s;ed of one &s;olid bone, as
Ari&s;totle has imagined; on the con|trary, though very &s;hort and mu&s;cular,
it has <PB N="221" REF="252"> as many bones as the camel or the hor&s;e; for it
is univer&s;al to all quadrupedes to have &s;even joints in the neck; and not
one of them have either more or le&s;s. However, the mu&s;cles in the neck of
the lion, that tye the bones toge|ther, are extremely &s;trong, and have
&s;ome|what the appearance of bones; &s;o that ancient authors, who have
treated of this animal, have mi&s;taken the whole for a &s;ingle bone. The
tongue is rough, and be&s;et with prickles as hard as a cat's claws; the&s;e
have the grain turned backwards; &s;o that it is probable a lion, if it
&s;hould attempt to lick a man's hand, as we are told it &s;ometimes does,
would tear off the &s;kin. The eyes are always bright and fiery; nor even in
death does this terrible look for&s;ake them. In &s;hort, the &s;tructure of
the paws, teeth, eyes, and tongue, are the &s;ame as in a cat; and al&s;o in
the inward parts the&s;e two ani|mals &s;o nearly re&s;emble each other, that
the anatomi&s;t's chief di&s;tinction ari&s;es merely from the &s;ize."</Q></P>
<P>The lion has, as was ob&s;erved before, a large mane, which grows
every year longer as the animal grows older: the lione&s;s is without this
ornament at every age. This mane is not coar&s;e or rough as in an hor&s;e, but
compo&s;ed of the &s;ame hair with the re&s;t of the body, lengthened, 
<PB N="222" REF="253"> and &s;hining. The mane, as well as the re&s;t of the
body, is of a yellow colour; nor is there ever any difference to be found in
the colour of one lion from that of another. What the ancients might have
&s;aid concerning black lions, or white, or &s;treaked like the tiger, is not
confirmed by modern experience; &s;o that the&s;e varieties have never been
&s;een, or exi&s;t no longer.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed that the lion is not
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling in &s;uch perfec|tion as
mo&s;t other animals. It is al&s;o ob&s;erved, that too &s;trong a light
greatly incommodes him. This is more than probable from the formation of his
eyes, which, like tho&s;e of the cat, &s;eem fitted for &s;eeing be&s;t in the
dark. For this rea|&s;on, he &s;eldom appears in open day, but ra|vages chiefly
by night; and not only the lion, but all other animals of the cat kind, are
kept off by the fires which the inhabitants light to pre&s;erve their herds and
flocks; the brightne&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lame dazzles their eyes, which are only fitted for &s;eeing in the
dark; and they are afraid to venture blindly into tho&s;e places which they
know to be filled with their enemies. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is equally true of all this kind, that they
hunt rather by the &s;ight than the &s;mell; and it &s;ometimes happens that
the lion pur&s;ues either <PB N="223" REF="254"> the jackall or the wild dog,
while they are hunting upon the &s;cent; and, when they have run the bea&s;t
down, he comes in and monopo|lizes the &s;poil. From hence, probably, may have
ari&s;en the &s;tory of the lion's provider: the&s;e little indu&s;trious
animals may often, it is true, provide a fea&s;t for the lion; but they have
hunted merely for them&s;elves, and he is an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits
of their toil."</Q></P>
<P>The lion, when hungry, boldly attacks all animals that come in his
way; but, as he is very formidable, and as they all &s;eek to avoid him, he is
often obliged to hide, in order to take them by &s;urprize. For this purpo&s;e
he crouches on his belly, in &s;ome thicket, or among the long gra&s;s, which
is found in many parts of the fore&s;t; in this retreat he continues, with
patient expectation, until his prey comes within a proper di&s;tance, and he
then &s;prings after it, fifteen or twenty feet from him, and often &s;eizes it
at the fir&s;t bound. If he mi&s;&s;es the effort, and in two or three
reiterated &s;prings cannot &s;eize his prey, he continues motionle&s;s for a
time, &s;eems to be very &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;appointment, and waits for a
more &s;ucce&s;s|ful opportunity. In the de&s;erts and fore&s;ts, his mo&s;t
u&s;ual prey are the gazelles and the <PB N="224" REF="255"> monkeys, with
which the torrid regions abound. The latter he takes when they happen to be
upon the ground, for he cannot climb trees like the cat or the tiger. He
devours a great deal at a time, and generally fills him&s;elf for two or three
days to come. His teeth are &s;o &s;trong that he very ea&s;ily breaks the
bones, and &s;wallows them with the re&s;t of the body. It is reported that he
&s;u&s;tains hunger a very long time, but thir&s;t he cannot &s;upport in an
equal degree, his temperament being extremely hot; &s;ome have even
a&s;&s;erted that he is in a continual fever. He drinks as often as he meets
with water, lapping it like a cat; which, as we know, drinks but &s;lowly. He
generally re|quires about fifteen pound of raw fle&s;h in a day; he prefers
that of live animals, and par|ticularly tho&s;e which he has ju&s;t killed. He
&s;eldom devours the bodies of animals when they begin to putrify; and he
chu&s;es rather to hunt for a fre&s;h &s;poil than to return to that which he
had half devoured before. However, though he u&s;ually feeds upon fre&s;h
provi&s;ion, his breath is very offen&s;ive, and his urine
in&s;up|portable.</P>
<P>The roaring of the lion is &s;o loud, that when it is heard in the
night, and re-echoed by the mountains, it re&s;embles di&s;tant thunder. This 
<PB N="225" REF="256"> roar is his natural note; for when enraged he has a
different growl, which is &s;hort, broken, and reiterated. The roar is a deep
hollow growl, which he &s;ends forth five or &s;ix times a day, particularly
before rains. The cry of anger is much louder and more formidable. This is
always excited by oppo&s;ition; and upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, when the lion
&s;ummons up all his terrors for the combat, nothing can be more terrible. He
then la&s;hes his &s;ides with his long tail, which alone is &s;trong enough to
lay a man level. He moves his mane in every direc|tion; it &s;eems to ri&s;e
and &s;tand like bri&s;tles round his head; the &s;kin and mu&s;cles of his
face are all in agitation; his huge eye-brows half cover his glaring eye balls;
he di&s;covers his teeth, which are formed rather for de&s;truction than
chewing his food; he &s;hews his tongue covered with points, and extends his
claws, which ap|pear almo&s;t as long as a man's fingers. Pre|pared in this
manner for war, there are few ani|mals that will venture to engage him; and
even the bolde&s;t of the human kind are daunted at his approach. The elephant,
the rhinoceros, the tiger, and the hippopotamos, are the only animals that are
not afraid &s;ingly to make op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="257"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Neverthele&s;s, neither the leopard nor the wild
boar, if provoked, will &s;hun the combat; they do not &s;eek the lion to
attack, but will not fly at his approach; they wait his on&s;et, which he
&s;eldom makes unle&s;s compelled by hunger; they then exert all their
&s;trength, and are &s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sful. We are told of the combat of a
lion and a wild boar, in a meadow near Algiers, which continued for a long time
with incredible ob&s;tinacy. At la&s;t, both were &s;een to fall by the wounds
they had given each other; and the ground all about them was co|vered with
their blood. The&s;e in&s;tances how|ever are very rare, for the lion is in
general the undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the fore&s;t. Man is the only creature
that attacks him with almo&s;t cer|tain &s;ucce&s;s; with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of dogs and hor&s;es, which are trained to the pur&s;uit. The&s;e animals that,
in a &s;tate of nature, would have fled from the pre&s;ence of the lion, in an
agony of con&s;ternation, when con&s;cious of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man,
become pur&s;uers in turn, and boldly hunt their natural tyrant. The dogs are
al|ways of the large breed; and the hor&s;es them|&s;elves, as Ga&s;ner
a&s;&s;ures us, mu&s;t be of that &s;ort called Charo&s;&s;i, or lion eyed, all
others of this kind flying at the &s;ight of the lion, and 
<PB N="227" REF="258"> endeavouring to throw their riders. When the lion is
rouzed, he recedes with a &s;low proud motion; he never goes off directly
forward, nor mea&s;ures his paces equally, but takes an oblique cour&s;e, going
from one &s;ide to the other, and bounding rather than running. When the
hunters approach him, they either &s;hoot or throw their javelins; and in this
man|ner di&s;able him before he is attacked by the dogs, many of whom he would
otherwi&s;e de|&s;troy. He is very vivacious, and is never killed at once, but
continues to fight de&s;pe|rately even after he has received his mortal blow.
He is al&s;o taken by pit-falls; the na|tives digging a deep hole in the
ground, and covering it &s;lightly over with &s;ticks and earth; which,
however, give way beneath his weight, and he &s;inks to the bottom, from whence
he has no means of e&s;cape. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual manner of taking this
animal is while yet a cub, and incapable of re&s;i&s;tance. The place near the
den of the lione&s;s is generally well known by the greatne&s;s of her
depredations on that occa&s;ion; the natives, therefore, watch the time of her
ab&s;ence and, aided by a &s;wift hor&s;e, carry off her cubs; which they
&s;ell to &s;trangers, or to the great men of their country."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="259">The lion, while young and active, lives by
hunting in the fore&s;t at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from any human habitation;
and &s;eldom quits this retreat while able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by his natural
indu&s;try; but when he becomes old, and unfit for the purpo&s;es of
&s;urprize, he boldly comes down into places more frequented, attacks the
flocks and herds that take &s;helter near the ha|bitation of the &s;hepherd or
the hu&s;bandman, and depends rather upon his courage than his addre&s;s for
&s;upport. It is remarkable, however, that when he makes one of the&s;e
de&s;perate &s;allies, if he finds men and quadrupedes in the &s;ame field, he
only attacks the latter, and never meddles with men, unle&s;s they provoke him
to engage. It is ob&s;erved that he prefers the fle&s;h of camels to any other
food; he is like|wi&s;e &s;aid to be fond of that of young elephants; the&s;e
he often attacks before their trunk is yet grown; and, unle&s;s the old
elephant comes to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he makes them an ea&s;y prey.</P>
<P>The lion is terrible upon all occa&s;ions, but particularly at
tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when he is incited by de&s;ire, or when the female has
brought forth. It is then that the lione&s;s is &s;een followed by eight or ten
males, who &s;ight mo&s;t bloody battles among each other, till one of them
be|comes <PB N="229" REF="260"> victorious over all the re&s;t. She is &s;aid
to bring forth in &s;pring, and to produce but once a year. 
<Q REND="inline">"With re&s;pect to the time of ge&s;tation,
naturali&s;ts have been divided, &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that the lione&s;s went
with young &s;ix months, and others but two. The time al&s;o of their growth
and their age have hitherto been left in ob&s;curity; &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that
they acquired their full growth in three years, and others that they required a
longer period to come to perfection; &s;ome &s;aying (and among this number is
Mr. Buffon) that they lived to but twenty, or twenty-two years at mo&s;t;
others making their lives even of &s;horter duration. All the&s;e doubts are
now reduced to certainty; for we have had &s;everal of the&s;e animals bred in
the Tower; &s;o that the manner of their co|pulation, the time of their
ge&s;tation, the num|ber they bring forth, and the time they take to come to
perfection, are all pretty well known. Although the lion emits his urine
backwards, yet he couples in the ordinary man|ner; and, as was &s;aid before,
his internal &s;truc|ture in almo&s;t every re&s;pect re&s;embles that of a
cat. The lione&s;s, however, is upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions particularly fierce,
and often wounds the lion in a terrible manner. She goes with young, 
<PB N="230" REF="261"> as I am a&s;&s;ured by her keeper, no more than five
months; the young ones, which are never more than two in number when brought
forth, are about the &s;ize of a large pug dog, harmle&s;s, pretty, and
playful; they continue the teat for twelve months, and the animal is more than
five years in coming to perfection. As to its age, from its impri&s;oned
&s;tate, we can have no cer|tainty; &s;ince it is very probable that, being
deprived of its natural climate, food, and ex|erci&s;e, its life mu&s;t be very
much abridged. However, naturali&s;ts have hitherto been greatly mi&s;taken as
to the length of its exi&s;tence. The great he-lion, called Pompey, which died
in the year 1760, was known to have been in the Tower for above &s;eventy
years; and one lately died there, which was brought from the river Gambia, that
died above &s;ixty-three. The lion, therefore, is a very long-lived animal;
and, very probably, in his native fore&s;ts, his age exceeds even that of man
him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>In this animal, all the pa&s;&s;ions, even of the mo&s;t gentle
kind, are in exce&s;s, but particu|larly the attachment of the female to her
young. The lione&s;s, though naturally le&s;s &s;trong, le&s;s courageous, and
le&s;s mi&s;chievous than the lion, becomes terrible when &s;he has got young
ones <PB N="231" REF="262"> to provide for. She then makes her incur&s;ions
with even more intrepidity than the lion him|&s;elf; &s;he throws her&s;elf
indi&s;criminately among men and other animals; de&s;troys without
di|&s;tinction; loads her&s;elf with the &s;poil, and brings it home reaking to
her cubs; whom &s;he accu&s;toms betimes to cruelty and &s;laughter. She
u&s;ually brings forth in the mo&s;t retired and inacce&s;&s;ible places; and
when &s;he fears to have her retreat di&s;covered, often hides her tracks, by
running back her ground, or by bru&s;hing them out with her tail. She
&s;ometimes al&s;o, when her apprehen&s;ions are great, tran&s;ports them from
one place to another; and, if ob|&s;tructed, defends them with determined
cou|rage, and fights to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The lion is chiefly an inhabitant of the torrid zone; and, as was
&s;aid, is always mo&s;t for|midable there: neverthele&s;s, he can
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in more temperate climates; and there was a time when even the
&s;outhern parts of Europe were infe&s;ted by him. At pre&s;ent, he is only
found in Africa and the Ea&s;t-Indies; in &s;ome of which countries he grows to
an enormous height. The lion of Bildulgedid is &s;aid to be nearly five feet
high, and between nine and ten feet from the tip of the no&s;e to the
in&s;ertion of the tail. <PB N="232" REF="263"> We have in the Tower, at
pre&s;ent, one of above four feet high, that was brought from Morocco, which is
the large&s;t that for &s;ome time pa&s;t has been &s;een in Europe. The
or|dinary &s;ize is between three and four feet; the female being in all her
dimen&s;ions about one third le&s;s than the male. There are no lions in
America; the Puma, which has received the name of the America Lion, is, when
compared, a very contemptible animal, having neither the &s;hape, the &s;ize,
nor the mane of the lion; being known to be extremely cowardly, to climb trees
for its prey, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t rather by its cunning than its courage, and to
be inferior even to the animal that goes by the name of the American Tiger. We
ought not, therefore, to confound this little treacherous creature with the
lion, which all the ancients have concurred in deno|minating the king of
bea&s;ts, and which they have de&s;cribed as brave and merciful. 
<Q REND="inline">"In|deed, the numerous accounts which they have
given us of this animal's genero&s;ity and tender|ne&s;s, &s;hew that there
mu&s;t be &s;ome foundation for the general belief of its good qualities; for
mankind &s;eldom err when they are all found to unite in the &s;ame &s;tory.

than this animal; the glo&s;&s;y &s;moothne&s;s of his hair, which lies much
&s;moother, and &s;hines with greater bright|ne&s;s than even that of the
leopard; the extreme blackne&s;s of the &s;treaks with which he is marked, and
the bright yellow colour of the ground which they diver&s;ify, at once &s;trike
the beholder. To this beauty of colouring is added an extremely elegant form,
much larger indeed than that of the leopard, but more &s;lender, more delicate,
and be&s;peaking the mo&s;t ex|treme &s;wiftne&s;s and agility. Unhappily,
how|ever, this animal's di&s;po&s;ition is as mi&s;chievous as its form is
admirable, as if Providence was willing to &s;hew the &s;mall value of beauty,
by be&s;towing it on the mo&s;t noxious of quadru|pedes. <PB N="234" REF="268">
We have, at pre&s;ent, one of the&s;e ani|mals in the Tower, which to the view
appears the mo&s;t good natured and harmle&s;s creature in the world; its
phy&s;iognomy is far from fierce or angry; it has not the commanding &s;tern
countenance of the lion, but a gentle placid air; yet for all this it is fierce
and &s;avage beyond mea&s;ure; neither correction can terrify it, nor
indulgence can tame."</Q></P>
<P>The chief and mo&s;t ob&s;ervable di&s;tinction in the tiger, and
in which it differs from all others of the mottled kind, is in the &s;hape of
its co|lours, which run in &s;treaks or bands in the &s;ame direction as his
ribs from the back down to the belly. The leopard, the panther, and the ounce,
are all partly covered like this animal, but with this difference, that their
colours are broken in &s;pots all over the body; whereas in the tiger they
&s;tretch lengthwi&s;e, and there is &s;carce a round &s;pot to be found on his
&s;kin. Be&s;ides this there are other ob&s;ervable di&s;tinc|tions: the tiger
is much larger, and often found bigger even than the lion him&s;elf: it is much
&s;lenderer al&s;o in proportion to its &s;ize; its legs &s;horter, and its
neck and body longer. In &s;hort, of all other animals, it mo&s;t re&s;embles
the cat in &s;hape; and, if we conceive the latter <PB N="235" REF="269">
magnified to a very great degree, we &s;hall have a tolerable idea of the
former.</P>
<P>In cla&s;&s;ing carnivorous animals, we may place the lion
foremo&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remainder of this de&s;cription is taken
from Mr. Buffon, except where marked with commas.</NOTE>; and immediately after
him follows the tiger, which &s;eems to par|take of all the noxious qualities
of the lion without &s;haring any of his good ones. To pride, courage, and
&s;trength, the lion joins greatne&s;s, clemency, and genero&s;ity; but the
tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without nece&s;&s;ity. The lion
&s;eldom ravages except when excited by hunger; the tiger, on the con|trary,
though glutted with &s;laughter, is not &s;a|tisfied, &s;till continues the
carnage, and &s;eems to have its courage only enflamed by not find|ing
re&s;i&s;tance. In falling in among a flock or an herd, it gives no quarter,
but levels all with indi&s;criminate cruelty, and &s;carce finds time to
appea&s;e its appetite while intent upon &s;atisfying the malignity of its
nature. It thus becomes the &s;courge of the country where it is found; it
fears neither the threats nor the oppo&s;ition of mankind; the bea&s;ts both
wild and tame fall equally a &s;acrifice to its in&s;atiable fury; the young
elephant and the rhinoceros become <PB N="236" REF="270"> equally its prey, and
it not unfrequently ven|tures to attack the lion him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Happily for the re&s;t of nature, that this ani|mal is not common,
and that the &s;pecies is chiefly confined to the warme&s;t provinces of the
ea&s;t. The tiger is found in Malabar, in Siam, in Ben|gal, and in all the
&s;ame countries which are inha|bited by the elephant or the rhinoceros. Some
even pretend that it has a friend&s;hip for, and often accompanies the latter,
in order to devour its excrements, which &s;erve it as a purge. Be this as it
will, there is no doubt but that they are often &s;een together at the &s;ides
of lakes and rivers; where they are probably both compelled to go by the
thir&s;t which in that torrid climate they mu&s;t very often endure. It is
likely enough al&s;o that they &s;eldom make war upon each other, the
rhinoceros being a peaceable animal, and the tiger knowing its &s;trength too
well to venture the engagement. It is &s;till more likely that the tiger finds
this a very convenient &s;itu|ation, &s;ince it can there &s;urprize a greater
num|ber of animals, which are compelled thither from the &s;ame motives. In
fact, it is generally known to lurk near &s;uch places where it has an
opportunity of chu&s;ing its prey, or rather of multiplying its ma&s;&s;acres.
When it has <PB N="237" REF="271"> killed one it often goes to de&s;troy
others, &s;wal|lowing their blood at large draughts, and &s;eem|ing rather
glutted than &s;atiated with its abun|dance.</P>
<P>However, when it has killed a large ani|mal, &s;uch as an hor&s;e,
or a buffalo, it imme|diately begins to devour it on the &s;pot, fearing to be
di&s;turbed. In order to fea&s;t at its ea&s;e, it carries off its prey to the
fore&s;t, dragging it along with &s;uch ea&s;e, that the &s;wiftne&s;s of its
motion &s;eems &s;carce retarded by the enormous load it &s;u&s;tains. From
this alone we may judge of its &s;trength; but, to have a more ju&s;t idea of
this particular, let us &s;top a moment to con|&s;ider the dimen&s;ions of this
mo&s;t formidable creature. Some travellers have compared it for &s;ize to an
hor&s;e, and others to a buffalo, while others have contented them&s;elves with
&s;aying that it was much larger than a lion. We have recent accounts of this
animal's magnitude that de&s;erve the utmo&s;t confidence. Mr. Buffon has been
a&s;&s;ured by one of his friends that he &s;aw a tiger, in the Ea&s;t-Indies,
of fifteen feet long. 
<Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;ing that he means including the tail,
this animal, allowing four feet for that, mu&s;t have been eleven feet from the
tip of the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion of the tail. Indeed, that which is now in
the Tower is not &s;o large, being as <PB N="238" REF="272"> well as I could
mea&s;ure &s;ix feet from the tip to the in&s;ertion, and the tail was three
feet more. Like all the re&s;t of its kind, its motions are irregular and
defaltory; it bounds rather than runs; and like them rather chu&s;es to take
its prey by &s;urprize than to be at the trouble of hunting it down."</Q> How
large a leap it can take at once we may ea&s;ily judge, by comparing what it
might do to what we &s;ee &s;o &s;mall an animal as the cat actually perform.
The cat can leap &s;everal feet at a bound; and the tiger, who is ten times as
long, can no doubt &s;pring proportionably.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The tiger is the only animal who&s;e &s;pirit
&s;eems untameable. Neither force nor con|&s;traint, neither violence nor
flattery, can pre|vail in the lea&s;t on its &s;tubborn nature. The
care&s;&s;es of the keeper have no influence on their heart of iron; and time,
in&s;tead of mollifying its di&s;po&s;ition, only &s;erves to encrea&s;e its
fierce|ne&s;s and malignity. The tiger &s;naps at the hand that feeds it as
well as that by which it is cha&s;ti&s;ed; every object &s;eems con&s;idered
only as its proper prey, which it devours with a look; and, although confined
by bars and chains, &s;till makes fruitle&s;s efforts, as if to &s;hew its
malig|nity when incapable of exerting its force."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="273">To give a &s;till more complete idea of the
&s;trength of this terrible creature, we &s;hall quote a pa&s;&s;age from
Father Tachard, who was an eye-witne&s;s of a combat between a tiger and two
elephants at Siam. For this purpo&s;e, the king ordered a lofty pali&s;ade to
be built of bambou cane, about an hundred feet &s;quare; and in the mid&s;t of
this were three elephants appointed for combating the tiger. Their heads and a
part of their trunk was covered with a kind of armour, like a ma&s;k, which
defended that part from the a&s;&s;aults of the fierce animal with which they
were to engage. As &s;oon, &s;ays this author, as we were arrived at the place,
a tiger was brought forth from its den, of a &s;ize much larger than we had
ever &s;een before. It was not at fir&s;t let loo&s;e, but held with chords,
&s;o that one of the elephants approaching, gave it three or four terrible
blows, with its trunk, on the back, with &s;uch force, that the tiger was for
&s;ome time &s;tunned, and lay without motion, as if it had been dead. However,
as &s;oon as it was let loo&s;e, and at full liberty, although the fir&s;t
blows had greatly abated its fury, it made at the elephant with a loud
&s;hriek, and aimed at &s;eizing his trunk. But the elephant, wrinkling it up
with great dexterity, received the tiger on his great teeth, and to&s;&s;ed it
up into the air. <PB N="240" REF="274"> This &s;o di&s;couraged the furious
animal, that it no more ventured to approach the elephant, but made &s;everal
circuits round the palli&s;ade, often attempting to fly at the &s;pectators.
Shortly after, three elephants were &s;ent again&s;t it, and they continued to
&s;trike it &s;o terribly with their trunks, that it once more lay for dead;
and they would certainly have killed it, had not there been a &s;top put to the
combat.</P>
<P>From this account, we may readily judge of the &s;trength of this
animal, which, though re|duced to captivity, and held by chords, though fir&s;t
di&s;abled, and &s;et alone again&s;t three, yet ventured to continue the
engagement, and even that again&s;t animals covered and protected from its
fury.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Captain Hamilton informs us, that in the Sundah
Rajha's dominions there are three forts of tigers in the woods, and that the
&s;malle&s;t are the fierce&s;t. This is not above two feet high, appears to be
extremely cunning, and delights in human fle&s;h. The &s;econd kind is about
three feet high, and hunts deer and wild hogs, be&s;ides the little animal
which has been already de&s;cribed, under the name of the Chevrotain, or Guinea
deer. The tiger of the large&s;t &s;ort, is above three feet and an half high;
but, al|though endued with greater powers, is, by no <PB N="241" REF="275">
means, &s;o rapacious as either of the former. This formidable animal, which is
called the Royal Tiger (one of which we have at pre&s;ent in the Tower) does
not &s;eem &s;o ravenous nor &s;o dangerous, and is even more cowardly. A
pea&s;ant in that country, as this traveller in|forms us, had a buffalo fallen
into a quagmire, and, while he went for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, there came a large
tiger, that, with its &s;ingle &s;trength, drew forth the animal, which the
united force of many men could not effect. When the people re|turned to the
place, the fir&s;t object they beheld was the tiger, who had thrown the buffalo
over its &s;houlder, as a fox does a goo&s;e, and was car|rying it away, with
the feet upward, towards its den; however, as &s;oon as it &s;aw the men, it
let fall its prey, and in&s;tantly fled to the woods: but it had previou&s;ly
killed the buffalo, and &s;ucked its blood; and, no doubt, the people were very
well &s;atisfied with its retreat. It may be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome
Ea&s;t-Indian buf|faloes weigh above a thou&s;and pounds, which is twice as
heavy as the ordinary run of our black cattle; &s;o that from hence we may form
a conception of the enormous &s;trength of this rapacious animal, that could
thus run off with a weight at lea&s;t twice as great as that of it&s;elf. 
<P><PB N="242" REF="276">"Were this animal as common as the
panther, or even as the lion him&s;elf, thus fur|ni&s;hed as it is with the
power to de&s;troy, and the appetite for &s;laughter, the country would be
uninhabitable where it re&s;ides. But luckily the &s;pecies is extremely
&s;carce; and has been &s;o &s;ince the earlie&s;t accounts we have had of the
tiger. About the times of Augu&s;tus, we are a&s;&s;ured by Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. viii. c. 17.</BIBL></NOTE>, that
when panthers were brought to Rome by hundreds, a &s;ingle tiger was
con&s;idered as an extraordinary &s;ight; and he tells us, that the emperor
Claudius was able to procure four only; which &s;hews how difficultly they were
procured. The incredible fiercene&s;s of this animal may be, in &s;ome
mea|&s;ure, the cau&s;e of the &s;carcity which was then at Rome, &s;ince it
was the opinion of Varo, that the tiger was never taken alive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">Tigris vivus capi ad huc non potuit.

native only of the Ea&s;t-Indies, and that par|ticularly of the warmer regions,
it is not to be wondered that the &s;pecies &s;hould be &s;o few."</P></Q></P>
<P>We may, therefore, con&s;ider the &s;pecies of true &s;treaked
tiger, as one of the &s;carce&s;t of animals, and much le&s;s diffu&s;ed than
that of the lion. As to the number of its young, we have <PB N="243" REF="277">
no certain accounts; however, it is &s;aid, that it brings forth four or five
at a time. Although furious at all times, the female, upon this oc|ca&s;ion,
exceeds her u&s;ual rapacity; and, if her young are taken from her, &s;he
pur&s;ues the &s;poiler with incredible rage; he, to &s;ave a part, is
contented to lo&s;e a part, and drops one of her cubs, with which &s;he
immediately returns to her den, and again pur&s;ues him; he then drops another,
and by the time &s;he has returned with that, he generally e&s;capes with the
remainder. If &s;he lo&s;es her young entirely, &s;he then be|comes
de&s;perate, boldly approaches even the towns them&s;elves, and commits
incredible &s;laughter. The tiger expre&s;&s;es its re&s;entment in the &s;ame
manner with the lion; it moves the mu&s;cles and &s;kin of its face, &s;hews
its teeth, and &s;hrieks in the mo&s;t frightful manner. Its note is very
different from that of the lion; being rather a &s;cream than a roar: and the
an|cients expre&s;&s;ed it very well, when they &s;aid that, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>tigrides indomitae rancant rugiunt que

<P>The &s;kin of the&s;e animals is much e&s;teemed all over the
ea&s;t, particularly in China; the Mandarines cover their &s;eats of ju&s;tice
in the public places with it, and convert it into co|verings for cu&s;hions in
winter. In Europe, the&s;e &s;kins, though but &s;eldom to be met with, 
<PB N="244" REF="278"> are of no great value, tho&s;e of the panther and the
leopard being held in much greater e&s;ti|mation. This is all the little
benefit we derive from this dreadful animal, of which &s;o many fal&s;ehoods
have been reported; as, that its &s;weat was poi&s;onous, and the hair of its
whi&s;kers more dangerous than an envenomed arrow. But the real mi&s;chiefs
which the tiger occa&s;ions while living are &s;ufficient, without giving
ima|ginary ones to the parts of its body when dead. In fact, the Indians
&s;ometimes eat its fle&s;h, and find it neither di&s;agreeable nor
unwhol&s;ome.</P>
<P>There is an animal of America, which is u&s;ually called the Red
Tiger, but Mr. Buffon calls it the Cougar, which, no doubt, is very different
from the tiger of the ea&s;t. Some, however, have thought proper to rank both
together; and I will take leave to follow their example, merely becau&s;e the
cougar is more like a tiger in every thing, except the colour, than any other
animal I know, having the head, the body and the neck, &s;haped very much in
the &s;ame manner. Of the&s;e &s;light differences, words would give but a very
faint idea; it will be, therefore, &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are
both equally &s;lender, and are &s;maller where the neck joins the head, than
others of the panther kind. There is one at <PB N="245" REF="279"> pre&s;ent in
the Tower; and it &s;eemed to me, as well as I could &s;ee it through the bars,
that were it properly &s;treaked and coloured, it would in all things
re&s;emble a &s;mall tiger. It is, however, of a very different colour, being
of a deep brown, and the tail very long and pointed. It is rather darker on the
back; un|der the chin it is a little whiti&s;h, as al&s;o on the lower part of
the belly.</P>
<P>Of all the American animals, this is the mo&s;t formidable and
mi&s;chievous; even their pre|tended lion not excepted. It is &s;aid, there are
&s;everal &s;orts of them; and, as well as I can re|member, I have &s;een one
or two here in En|gland, both differing from the pre&s;ent, in &s;ize and
conformation. It is, indeed, a vain endea|vour to attempt to de&s;cribe all the
le&s;s obvious varieties in the cat kind. If we examine them minutely, we
&s;hall find the differences multiply upon us &s;o much, that, in&s;tead of an
hi&s;tory, we &s;hall only be paid with a catalogue of di&s;tinctions. From
&s;uch of them as I have &s;een, within the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix years, I think I
could add two animals of this &s;pecies, that have not been hitherto
de&s;cribed, and with the names of which he that &s;hewed them was utterly
unac|quainted. But it is a poor ambition, that of being eager to find out new
di&s;tinctions, or <PB N="246" REF="280"> adding one noxious animal more, to a
li&s;t that is already &s;ufficiently numerous. Were the knowing a new variety
to open an unknown hi&s;tory, or in the lea&s;t to extend our knowledge, the
enquiry would be then worth pur&s;uing; but what &s;ignifies mentioning &s;ome
trifling differ|ence, and from thence becoming authors of a new name, when the
difference might have ori|ginally proceeded either from climate, &s;oil, or
indi&s;criminate copulation?</P>
<P>The cougars are extremely common in South America, and, where the
towns border upon the fore&s;t, the&s;e make frequent incur&s;ions by night
into the mid&s;t of the &s;treets, carrying off fowls, dogs, and other
dome&s;tic creatures. They are, however, but weak and contemptible, com|pared
to the great tiger, being found unable to cope with a &s;ingle man. The Negroes
and Indians are very dextrous in encountering them; and &s;ome, even for the
&s;ake of their &s;kins, &s;eek them in their retreats. The arms in this
combat, &s;eemingly &s;o dangerous, are only a launce of two or three yards
long, made of heavy wood, with the point hardened in the fire; and a kind of
&s;cymitar, of about three quarters of a yard in length. Thus armed, they wait
till the tiger makes an a&s;&s;ault again&s;t the left hand, which holds the
lance, and is <PB N="247" REF="281"> wrapped up in a &s;hort cloak of baize.
Some|times the animal, aware of the danger, &s;eems to decline the combat; but
then its antagoni&s;t provokes it with a &s;light touch of the launce, in
order, while he is defending him&s;elf, to &s;trike a &s;ure blow. As &s;oon,
therefore, as the creature feels the lance, it gra&s;ps it with one of its
paws, and with the other &s;trikes at the arm which holds it. Then it is that
the per&s;on nimbly aims a blow with his &s;cymetar, which he kept concealed,
with the other hand, and ham&s;trings the creature, which immediately draws
back enraged, but in&s;tantly returns to the charge. But then, receiving
another &s;troke, it is totally deprived of the power of motion: and the
combatant, killing it at his lei&s;ure, &s;trips the &s;kin, cuts off the head,
and returns to his companions, di&s;playing the&s;e as the trophies of his
victory.</P>
<P>This animal, as we are a&s;&s;ured, is often more &s;ucce&s;sful
again&s;t the crocodile; and it is the only quadrupede in that part of the
world, that is not afraid of the engagement. It mu&s;t be no unplea&s;ant
&s;ight to ob&s;erve, from a place of &s;afety, this extraordinary combat,
between ani|mals &s;o terrible and obnoxious to man. Such as have &s;een it,
de&s;cribe it in the following manner. When the tiger, impelled by thir&s;t, 
<PB N="248" REF="282"> that &s;eems continually to con&s;ume it, comes down to
the river &s;ide to drink, the crocodile, which makes no di&s;tinction in its
prey, lifts its head above water to &s;eize it; the tiger, not le&s;s rapacious
than the other, and unacquainted with the force of the enemy, boldly ventures
to &s;eize it, and plunges its claws into the eyes of the crocodile, which is
the only vulnerable part of its body: upon this the crocodile in&s;tantly dives
under water, and the tiger goes down with him, for it will &s;ooner die than
let go its hold. In this manner the combat continues for &s;ome time, until the
tiger is drowned, or e&s;capes, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, from its
di&s;abled enemy.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are common in Guiana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon vol. xix. p. 22.</BIBL></NOTE>. They were formerly
&s;een &s;wimming over, in great numbers, into the i&s;land of Cayenne, to
attack and ravage the flocks and herds of the inhabitants. In the beginning,
they were a terrible &s;courge to the infant colony; but, by degrees, they were
repul&s;ed and de&s;troyed, and are now &s;een no longer at that place. They
are found in Brazil, in Paraguay, in the country of the Amazons, and in
&s;everal other parts of South America. They often climb trees in que&s;t of
prey, or to avoid their pur&s;uers. They <PB REF="283">

&s;ure of their enemies being near, and their nocturnal eyes are dazzled by the

is mo&s;t likely to be true; namely, that the mo&s;t valuable part of this

<HEAD>THE PANTHER, AND THE LEOPARD.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto found no great difficulty in di&s;tingui&s;hing
one animal from another, each carrying its own peculiar marks, which, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, &s;erve to &s;eparate it from all the re&s;t. But it is otherwi&s;e,
when we come to the&s;e of the cat kind, that fill up the cha&s;m between the
tiger and the cat. The &s;pots with which their &s;kins are diver&s;ified, are
&s;o various, and their &s;ize &s;o equivocal, that it is no ea&s;y matter to 
<PB N="250" REF="288"> di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;pecies, particularly as we have
little el&s;e but the &s;pots and the &s;ize to guide us in making the
di&s;tinction. If we regard the figure and diver&s;ity of the &s;pots, we
&s;hall find many varieties not taken notice of by any natu|rali&s;t; if we are
led by the &s;ize, we &s;hall find an imperceptible gradation from the cat to
the tiger. It would be vain, therefore, to make as many varieties in the&s;e
animals as we &s;ee differ|ences in &s;pots or &s;tature; it will be
&s;ufficient to &s;eize the mo&s;t general di&s;tinctions, and leave the re&s;t
to &s;uch as are fond of more minute di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, who&s;e &s;kins are &s;o beauti|fully
&s;potted, and who&s;e natures are &s;o mi&s;|chievous, the Panther may be
con&s;idered as the foremo&s;t. This animal has been by many naturali&s;ts
mi&s;taken for the tiger; and, in fact, it approaches next to it in &s;ize,
fiercene&s;s and beauty. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed, however, by one obvious and
leading character; that of being &s;potted, not &s;treaked; for, in this
particular, the tiger differs from the panther, the leopard, and almo&s;t all
the inferior ranks of this mi&s;|chievous family.</P>
<P>This animal, which Mr. Buffon calls &s;imply the Panther, Linnaeus
the Pard, Ge&s;ner the Pardalis, and the modern Latins the Leopardus; 
<PB N="251" REF="289"> this animal, I &s;ay, which goes by too many names, and
which the Engli&s;h have indi&s;crimi|nately called by the name of the panther
or the leopard, may be con&s;idered as the large&s;t of the kind, and is
&s;potted in a manner &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e that are &s;maller. As
tho&s;e &s;pots, however, make the principal difference between it and the
le&s;&s;er animals, which it otherwi&s;e re&s;embles in &s;hape, &s;ize,
di&s;po&s;ition, and beauty, I will fir&s;t &s;hew tho&s;e &s;light
di|&s;tinctions, and mention the names each animal has received in
con&s;equence thereof; and then proceed to give their hi&s;tory together,
&s;till marking any peculiarity ob&s;ervable in one of the &s;pecies, which is
not found in the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to the great panther, already mentioned, is the animal which
Mr. Buffon calls the Leopard, a name which he acknowledges to be given
arbitrarily, for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction. Other naturali&s;ts have not much
attended to the &s;light differences between this and the great panther, nor
have they con&s;idered its di&s;crimi|nations as &s;ufficient to entitle it to
another name. It has hitherto, therefore, gone under the name of the Leopard,
or Panther of Senegal, where it is chiefly found. The differences between this
animal and the former are the&s;e: the large panther is often found to be &s;ix
feet long, from <PB N="252" REF="290"> the tip of the no&s;e to the in&s;ertion
of the tail; the panther of Senegal is not above four. The large panther is
marked with &s;pots in the manner of a ro&s;e, that is, five or &s;ix make a
kind of circle, and there is generally a large one in the middle. The leopard
of Senegal has a much more beautiful coat, the yellow is more brilliant, and
the &s;pots are &s;maller, and not di&s;po&s;ed in rings but in clu&s;ters. As
to the re&s;t, they are both whitei&s;h under the belly; the tail in both is
pretty long, but rather longer in proportion in the latter, than the former. To
the&s;e two animals, who&s;e differences &s;eem to be &s;o very minute, we may
add a third; namely, the <HI>Jaguar</HI> or Panther of America. This, in every
re&s;pect, re&s;embles the two former, except in the di&s;po&s;ition of its
&s;pots, and that its neck and head are rather &s;treaked than &s;potted. The
jaguar is al&s;o &s;aid to be lower upon its legs, and le&s;s than the leopard
of Senegal. The&s;e three quadrupedes, as we &s;ee, have but very &s;light
differences, and the principal di&s;tinction u&s;ed by Mr. Buffon, is taken
from the &s;ize; the fir&s;t, as he &s;ays, is u&s;ually &s;ix feet long; the
&s;econd, four feet; and the la&s;t, about three: however, it appears from the
particular &s;ubjects of his de&s;cription, that the panther in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was not above three feet &s;even inches long; that

leopard's &s;kin which he de&s;cribes, was about four; and that the jaguar, at
two years old, was between two and three feet long, which, when come to its
full growth, would, no doubt, be four feet long, as well as the two former.
From hence, therefore, we may conclude, that the &s;ize in the&s;e animals is
not &s;ufficient to make a di&s;tinction among them; and that tho&s;e who
called them all three by the indi&s;criminate names of the leopard and the
panther, if not right, were at lea&s;t excu&s;eable. Of tho&s;e which are now
to be &s;een in the Tower, the jaguar, or the American panther, is rather the
large&s;t of the three; and is by no means the contemptible animal which Mr.
Buffon de&s;cribes it to be: the leopard is the lea&s;t of them, and has, by
&s;ome travellers, been &s;uppo&s;ed to be an animal produced between the
panther and the ounce, an animal which re&s;embles, but is le&s;s than any of
the former. The&s;e three animals we may, therefore, rank together, as they
agree pretty nearly in their robe, their &s;ize, their di&s;po&s;itions, and
their ferocity.</P>
<P>We come next to an animal confe&s;&s;edly dif|ferent from any of
the former, being much &s;maller, and its colour more inclining to white. Its
name, however, in our language, has cau&s;ed no &s;mall confu&s;ion It has been
ge|nerally <PB N="254" REF="295"> called by foreigners, the Onza, or the Ounce,
and this name &s;ome of our own writers have thought proper to give it; but
others of them, and the&s;e the mo&s;t celebrated, &s;uch as Willoughby, have
given this name to a different animal, with a &s;hort tail, and known to the
ancients and moderns by the name of the Lynx. I confe&s;s my&s;elf at a lo&s;s,
in this ca&s;e, whom to follow; the alteration of names &s;hould be al|ways
made with great caution, and never but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. If we
follow Willoughby, there will be an animal of the panther kind, very
di&s;tingui&s;hable from all the re&s;t, left without a name; and if we recede
from him, it will &s;erve to produce &s;ome confu&s;ion among all the nu|merous
cla&s;s of readers and writers who have taken him for their guide: however, as
he &s;eems him&s;elf to have been an innovator, the name of the lynx having
been long adopted into our language before, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to give the
animal that bore it another name, and to call that creature an ounce, which our
old writers had been accu&s;tomed to know by the Latin appellation, for this
rea&s;on, therefore, we may &s;afely venture to take a name that has been long
mi&s;applied, from the lynx, and re|&s;tore it to the animal in que&s;tion. We
will, therefore, call that animal of the panther kind, <PB REF="296">

remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that name by which it was known among all our
old Engli&s;h writers, as well as by all antiquity.</P>
<P>The Ounce, or the Onca of Linnaeus, is much le&s;s than the
panther, being not, at mo&s;t, above three feet and a half long: however, its
hair is much longer than that of the panther, and its tail &s;till more &s;o.
The panther of four or five feet long, has a tail but of two feet, or two feet
and an half. The ounce, which is but about three feet, has a tail often longer
than the re&s;t of its body. The colour of the ounce is al&s;o apparently
different, being rather more inclining to a cream colour, which is deeper on
the back, and whiter towards the belly. The hair on the back is an inch and an
half long; that on the belly, two inches and an half, which is much longer than
that of the panther. Its &s;pots are di&s;po&s;ed pretty much in the &s;ame
manner as the large panther, except that on the haunches it is rather marked
with &s;tripes than with &s;pots.</P>
<P>De&s;cending to animals of this kind that are &s;till &s;maller,
we find the Catamountain, which is the Ocelot of Mr. Buffon, or the Tiger Cat
of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who exhibit it as a &s;how. It is <PB N="256" REF="300">
le&s;s than the ounce, but its robe more beau|tifully variegated. It is an
American animal, and is about two feet and an half in length, from the no&s;e
to the in&s;ertion of the tail. It is extremely like a cat, except that it is
larger and &s;lenderer, that its colours are more beau|tiful, and its tail
rather &s;horter. The fur is of a reddi&s;h colour, the whole beautified with
black &s;pots, and &s;treaks of different figures. They are long on the back,
and round on the belly and paws. On the ears are black &s;tripes, which run
acro&s;s; but, in other re&s;pects, they entirely re&s;emble tho&s;e of a cat.
The&s;e colours, however, which naturali&s;ts have taken great pains minutely
to de&s;cribe, are by no means permanent, being differently di&s;po&s;ed in
differ|ent animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. I remember to have &s;een an animal
of this &s;ize, but whether of this &s;pecies I will not pretend to &s;ay,
&s;ome years ago, that was entirely brown, and was &s;aid al&s;o to have come
from America.</P>
<P>From this tribe of the cat kind with &s;potted &s;kins and a long
tail, we come to another, with &s;kins diver&s;ified in like manner, but with a
&s;horter tail. The principal of the&s;e is the Lynx, the name by which the
animal was known to Aelian, among the ancients; and to all our old Engli&s;h
writers, among tho&s;e of a <PB N="257" REF="301"> more modern date. This name
has been corrupted by the Portugue&s;e into the word Ouze; and this corruption
has been adopted by Ray, who has improperly called this animal the Ounce, after
&s;ome of the fo|reign travellers. The fir&s;t &s;triking di&s;tinction between
the lynx, and all tho&s;e of the panther kind, is in its tail, which is at
lea&s;t half as &s;hort in proportion, and black at the ex|tremity. Its fur is
much longer, the &s;pots on the &s;kin le&s;s vivid, and but confu&s;edly
mingled with the re&s;t. Its ears are much longer, and tipped at the points
with a black tuft of hair. The colour round the eyes is white, and the
phy&s;iognomy more placid and gentle. Each hair of this animal is of three
different colours: the root is of a greyi&s;h brown; the middle red, or of an
a&s;h colour; and the ends white. This whitene&s;s at the ends takes up &s;o
&s;mall a part of the particular hair, that it does not prevent us from
&s;eeing the principal colour, which is that of the middle part; &s;o that it
only makes the &s;urface of the body appear as if it was &s;ilvered over:
however, the hair of which the &s;pots con&s;i&s;t, has no white at the ends,
and at the roots it is not quite &s;o black as the other part. This animal is
not above the &s;ize of the ounce, but is rather &s;tronger built, and it has 
<PB N="258" REF="302"> but twenty-eight teeth; whereas all the re&s;t of the
cat kind already mentioned have thirty.</P>
<P>Another animal of this kind is called the Sia|gu&s;h, or, as Mr.
Buffon names it, the Caracal. It is a native of the Ea&s;t-Indies, and
re&s;embles the lynx in &s;ize, in form, and even in the &s;in|gularity of
being tufted at the tips of the ears. However, the &s;iagu&s;h differs in not
being mottled as the lynx is; its fur, or rather hair, is rougher and
&s;horter; its tail is rather longer; its muzzle more lengthened; its
phy&s;iognomy more fierce, and its nature more &s;avage.</P>
<P>The third, and la&s;t animal that need be men|tioned of this kind,
is that which Mr. Buffon calls the Serval, and which he has fir&s;t
de&s;cribed. It is a native of Malabar, re&s;embling the pan|ther in its
&s;pots, but the lynx in the &s;hortne&s;s of its tail, in its &s;ize, and in
its &s;trong built form.</P>

animals of the panther kind, from the large&s;t of this tribe down to the
dome&s;tic cat, which is the &s;malle&s;t of all the&s;e fierce and
mi&s;chievous varieties. In all, their nature &s;eems pretty much the &s;ame;
being equally fierce, &s;ubtle, cruel, and cowardly. The pan|ther, including

are they the mo&s;t dangerous of this kind; for the whole race of cats are
noxious in pro|portion to their power to do mi&s;chief. They inhabit the mo&s;t
torrid latitudes of India, Africa, and America, and have never been able to
mul|tiply beyond the torrid zone. They are gene|rally found in the thicke&s;t

attack man, even though provoked by him; they &s;eem rather de&s;irous of
finding &s;afety by flight, or by climbing trees, at which they are very
expert. In this manner al&s;o, they often pur&s;ue their prey; and, being
expert at &s;eizing it, as well above as below, they cau&s;e a va&s;t
de|&s;truction. Of all other animals, the&s;e are the mo&s;t &s;ullen, and,
even to a proverb, untame|able. They &s;till pre&s;erve their fierce and
treach|erous &s;pirit; and at tho&s;e places where they are expo&s;ed to be
&s;een among others, we often ob&s;erve, that while their keeper is familiar
with the lion or the bear, yet he is apprehen&s;ive of the large panther, and
keeps it bound with the &s;horte&s;t chain.</P>
<P>As the ounce differs from the&s;e in figure and &s;ize, &s;o
al&s;o it &s;eems to differ in di&s;po&s;ition, being more mild, tractable, and
tame. The&s;e <PB N="260" REF="307"> we frequently &s;ee as harmle&s;s and
innocent as cats; and there is one at pre&s;ent in the Tower with which the
keeper plays without the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion. I own I was not a little
unea&s;y, at fir&s;t, for the man, when he put his hand through the bars, and
called the animal by its name; but was a good deal &s;urprized to &s;ee the
creature, which one might &s;uppo&s;e irritated by long confinement, come
gently up to him, &s;troak his hand with its face, in the manner of a cat, and
te&s;tify the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. The ounce, therefore,
is remarkable for being ea&s;ily tamed; and, in fact, it is employed all over
the ea&s;t for the purpo&s;es of hunting. Not, in|deed, but that panthers
them&s;elves are &s;ome|times u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, but they are never
thoroughly &s;ubdued like the former, being u&s;ually brought to the field in a
carriage, and kept chained and caged until they are &s;hewn the gazelle, or the
leveret, which is their prey. This they pur&s;ue rather by three or four great
&s;prings than by running. If they &s;eize it by this &s;udden effort, it finds
no mercy; but if it e&s;capes from their fir&s;t effort, they never at|tempt to
pur&s;ue, and appear quite di&s;appointed and confounded at their mi&s;chance.
It &s;ome|times happens that they are &s;o much enraged at it, that they attack
even their employer, and <PB N="261" REF="308"> his only re&s;ource to avoid
their fury is to throw them &s;ome &s;mall pieces of meat, which he has brought
with him for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The ounce, however, is not &s;o dangerous; and is treated with
more confidence and fami|liarity. It is u&s;ually brought to the field
hood|winked behind one of the hor&s;emen. When the game appears, the ounce is
in&s;tantly un|covered, and &s;hewn where it lies; upon which the fierce
creature darts like an arrow to the place, and &s;eizes it at once, or,
mi&s;&s;ing it, re|mains motionle&s;s in the place. It would be vain to attempt
retrieving its di&s;grace by con|tinuing the pur&s;uit; for, although it bounds
with greater agility than mo&s;t other animals, yet it is &s;low and aukward in
running, and has no means of finding the animal it pur&s;ues by the &s;mell, as
is common among tho&s;e of the dog kind. From hence, therefore, it appears how
much &s;uperior the European method of hunting is to that of the A&s;iatic;
&s;ince what|ever amu&s;ement this exerci&s;e affords mu&s;t ari&s;e from the
continuance of the chace, and from the fluctuation of doubt and expectation,
which rai&s;e and depre&s;s the pur&s;uers by turns. All this an A&s;iatic
hunter is deprived of; and his greate&s;t plea&s;ure can &s;carcely be more
than what among us is called cour&s;ing, in which the <PB N="262" REF="309">
dog pur&s;ues the animal, and keeps it con&s;tantly in view.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that it is from choice the
A&s;iatics u&s;e this method of chace; for, no doubt, were dogs &s;erviceable
among them as they are in Europe, they would be employed for the &s;ame
purpo&s;es. But the fact is, that the extreme heat of the tropical climates
produces &s;uch univer&s;al putrefaction, and &s;ends up &s;uch various and
powerful &s;cents, that dogs are at fir&s;t bewildered in the chace, and at
la&s;t come to lo&s;e the delicacy of their &s;cent entirely. They are,
therefore, but little u&s;ed in tho&s;e warm countries; and what could they
avail in places where almo&s;t every other animal of the fore&s;t is &s;tronger
and more rapacious? The lion, the tiger, the panther, and the ounce, are all
na|tural enemies to the dog, and attack him where|ever he appears with
ungovernable fury. The breed, therefore, in tho&s;e places, would quickly be
de&s;troyed; &s;o that they are obliged to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e animals
which are more fitted to &s;erve them; and thus convert the ounce to tho&s;e
purpo&s;es for which dogs are employed in Europe.</P>
<P>The Catamountain, or Ocelot, is one of the fierce&s;t and, for its
&s;ize, one of the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive animals in the world. It is, as was 
<PB N="263" REF="310"> before ob&s;erved, a native of South-America, and by no
means capable of the &s;ame education as the ounce, which it more approaches in
&s;ize than in di&s;po&s;ition. Two of the&s;e, from whom Mr. Buffon has taken
his de&s;cription, were brought over from Carthagena, and having been taken
from the dam when very young, were afterwards &s;uckled by a bitch. But, before
they were three months old, they had &s;trength and ingratitude &s;ufficient to
kill and devour their nur&s;e. Their &s;ucceeding fiercene&s;s and malignity
&s;eemed to corre&s;pond with their fir&s;t efforts; for no arts could tame or
&s;often their natures; and while they continued in their cages, they &s;till
te&s;tified an uncea&s;ing di&s;po|&s;ition for &s;laughter. When their food
was given them, the male always &s;erved him&s;elf before the female ventured
to touch a bit; and it was not till he was &s;atisfied that the other began. In
their &s;avage &s;tate, the&s;e animals are &s;till more de&s;tructive; having
great &s;trength and agility, they very ea&s;ily find and overtake their prey,
which they pur&s;ue among the tops of the trees as well as on the ground; but
what renders them &s;till more mi&s;chievous is, their uncea&s;ing ap|petite
rather for the blood than the fle&s;h of their prey. They &s;uck this with the
greate&s;t avidity, but frequently leave the carca&s;e otherwi&s;e un|touched, 
<PB N="264" REF="311"> in order to pur&s;ue other animals for the blood in like
manner. They generally continue on the tops of trees, like our wild cats; where
they make their ne&s;t, and often bring forth their young. When they &s;py any
animal they can ma&s;ter, and there are but few in the fore&s;t but what are
inferior, they dart down upon it with inevitable exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole tribe of animals of the panther kind, with long tails,
are chiefly inhabitants, as was &s;aid, of the torrid zone; but tho&s;e of the
&s;hort tailed kind, and particularly the lynx, is principally found in the
cold countries that are bordering on the pole. The lynx is chiefly to be met
with in the north of Germany, Li|thuania, Mu&s;covy, Siberia, and North
Ame|rica. Tho&s;e of the new continent, however, are rather &s;maller than in
Europe, as is the ca&s;e with almo&s;t all their quadrupedes; they are
&s;omewhat whiter al&s;o, but in other re&s;pects there is &s;carce any
difference to be found among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. This animal has been called by &s;ome
<HI>Lupus Cervarius,</HI> or a creature compounded be|tween a wolf and a
&s;tag; but for what rea&s;on is hard to gue&s;s; it no way re&s;embles either
in &s;hape or in di&s;po&s;ition. In its nature, it exactly re&s;embles the
cat, except that, being bigger and <PB N="265" REF="312"> nearly two feet long,
it is bolder and fiercer. Like the cat, it climbs trees, and &s;eeks its prey
by &s;urprize; like the cat, it is delicate and cleanly, covering its urine
with its paws; and it re&s;embles the wolf in nothing except its cry, which
often deceives the hunters, and induces them to think they hear a wolf and not
a lynx. This animal al&s;o, is rather more delicate than the cat; and, after
having once fea&s;ted upon its prey, will never return to it again, but hunts
the woods for another. From hence may have ari&s;en the common report of the
lynx having, of all other quadrupedes, the &s;horte&s;t memory. This, however,
is not the only idle &s;tory that has been propagated of it: as of its &s;eeing
with &s;uch per|&s;picuity as to perceive objects through walls and mountains;
as of having its urine of &s;uch a quality, as to harden, and become a precious
&s;tone; with &s;everal others, propagated by igno|rance or impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Siagu&s;h and the Serval are both &s;o like all the re&s;t of
the cat kind in di&s;po&s;ition, that it is but repeating the &s;ame account
once more to give their di&s;tinct hi&s;tory. As the lynx is found only in cold
countries, &s;o the &s;iagu&s;h is to be met with only in the warm tropical
climates. It is u&s;ed, in the &s;ame manner as the ounce, for hunting; but it
&s;eems to have a property which <PB N="266" REF="313"> the other has not;
namely, that of being able to overtake its prey by pur&s;uing it. Whether this
is performed by having a finer &s;cent than the former, or greater
&s;wiftne&s;s, we are not in|formed; being only told that when it overtakes
either the gazelle or the antelope, it leaps upon their backs, and, getting
forward to their &s;houlders, &s;cratches their eyes out, by which means they
become an ea&s;y prey to the hunters. Some have called this animal the lion's
pro|vider; and it is &s;aid that when it calls him to pur&s;ue his prey, its
voice very much re&s;embles that of one man calling another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Thevenot, vol. ii. p. 114.</BIBL></NOTE>. From hence we may
conjecture that this animal pur&s;ues its prey in full cry, and that the lion
only follows to partake or &s;eize the &s;poil. The &s;ame ac|count is given
al&s;o of the jackal; and very pro|bably it may be true, not only of the&s;e
animals, but of &s;ome others, &s;ince it is natural enough to &s;uppo&s;e that
the lion will pur&s;ue whenever he is taught to di&s;cover his prey.</P>
<P>We had one of the&s;e animals a few years ago &s;ent over from the
Ea&s;t-Indies, but it was not able to endure the change of climate, and it died
in a very &s;hort time after it was brought to the Tower. Whether con&s;umed by
di&s;ea&s;e or not I cannot tell, but it &s;eemed to me much 
<PB N="267" REF="314"> &s;lenderer than the cat or the lynx, and its ears were
much longer; however, it is a very &s;trong creature for its &s;ize, and has
been known to kill a large dog in &s;ingle combat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>: never|thele&s;s, it is, like all of
the cat kind except the lion, remarkable for its cowardice, and will never,
except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, attack an animal that is its equal in
&s;trength or activity. For this rea&s;on, when brought into the field, and put
upon a &s;ervice of danger, it ob&s;tinately refu&s;es, and is alert only in
the pur&s;uit of animals that are too feeble for re&s;i&s;tance, or too timid
to exert their &s;trength.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid of this rapacious tribe, we perceive a
&s;imilitude in the manners and di&s;po&s;itions of them all, from the lion to
the cat. The &s;imilitude of their internal con|formation, is &s;till more
exact; the &s;hortne&s;s of their inte&s;tines, the number of their teeth, and
the &s;tructure of their paws. The fir&s;t of this cla&s;s is the Lion,
di&s;tingui&s;hable from all the re&s;t by his &s;trength, his magnitude, and
his mane. The &s;econd is the Tiger, rather longer than the lion, but not &s;o
tall, and known by the &s;treaks and the vivid beauty of its robe; including
al&s;o the American tiger or cougar; di&s;tin|gui&s;hable by its &s;ize, next
that of the tiger, <PB N="268" REF="315"> its tawny colour, and its &s;pots.
The third is the Pan|ther and the Leopard. The four this the Ounce, not &s;o
large as any of the former, &s;potted like them, but di&s;tingui&s;hable by the
cream coloured ground of its hair, and the great length of its tail, being
above the length of its body. The fifth is the Catamountain or Tiger cat,
le&s;s than the ounce, but differing particularly in having a &s;horter tail,
and being &s;treaked down the back like a tiger. The &s;ixth is the &s;hort
tailed kind; namely, the Lynx, of the &s;ize of the former, but with a &s;hort
tail, &s;treaked, and the tips of its ears tufted with black. The &s;eventh is
the Syagu&s;h, differing from the lynx in not being mottled like it, in not
being &s;o large, and in having the ears longer, though tipped with black, as
before. The eighth is the Serval, re&s;embling the lynx in its form, and the
&s;hortne&s;s of its tail; &s;treaked al&s;o like it, but not having the tips
of its ears tufted. La&s;tly, the Cat, wild and tame, with all its varieties;
all le&s;s than any of the former, but, like them, equally in&s;idious,
rapacious, and cruel.</P>
<P>This whole race may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formidable enemy
of mankind; there are others indeed &s;tronger, but they are gentle, and never
offer injury till injured: there are others <PB N="269" REF="316"> more
numerous, but they are more feeble, and rather look for &s;afety by hiding from
man, than oppo&s;ing him. The&s;e are the only qua|drupedes that make good
their ground again&s;t him; and which may be &s;aid to keep &s;ome kingdoms of
the earth in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. How many exten&s;ive countries are
there in Africa, where the wild bea&s;ts are &s;o numerous, that man is
deterred from living among&s;t them; reluctantly giving up to the lion and the
leo|pard, exten&s;ive tracts, that &s;eem formed only for his delight and
convenience!</P>

<PB N="270" REF="317">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Animals of the Dog Kind.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd cla&s;s of carnivorous quadru|pedes may be denominated
tho&s;e of the dog kind. This cla&s;s is neither &s;o numerous nor &s;o
powerful as the former, and yet neither &s;o treacherous, rapacious, or
cowardly. This cla&s;s may be principally di&s;tingui&s;hed by their claws,
which have no &s;heath, like tho&s;e of the cat kind, but &s;till continue at
the point of each toe, without a capability of being &s;tretched forward, or
drawn back. The no&s;e al&s;o, as well as the jaw, of all the dog kind, is
longer than in the cat; the body is, in proportion, more &s;trongly made, and
covered with hair in&s;tead of fur. There are many internal di&s;tinctions
al&s;o; as in the inte&s;tines, which are much longer in the dog kind, than in
tho&s;e of the cat; the eye is not formed for night vi&s;ion; and the olfactory
nerves are diffu&s;ed, in the dog kinds, upon a very exren&s;ive membrane
within the &s;cull.</P>
<P>If we compare the natural habitudes of this cla&s;s with the former,
we &s;hall find that the dog kinds are not &s;o &s;olitary as tho&s;e of the
cat, but love to hunt in company, and encourage each other with their mutual
cries. In this manner <PB N="271" REF="318"> the dog and the jackall pur&s;ue
their prey; and the wolf and fox, which are of this kind, though more
&s;olitary and &s;ilent among us, yet, in coun|tries where le&s;s per&s;ecuted,
and where they can more fearle&s;s di&s;play their natural inclinations, they
are found to keep together in packs, and pur&s;ue their game with alternate
howlings.</P>
<P>Animals of the dog kind want &s;ome of the advantages of the cat
kind, and yet are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of others in which the latter are
deficient. Upon ob&s;erving their claws, it will ea&s;ily be per|ceived that
they cannot, like cats, pur&s;ue their prey up the &s;ides of a tree, and
continue the chace among the branches; their unmanage|able claws cannot &s;tick
in the bark, and thus &s;upport the body up along the trunk, as we &s;ee the
cat very ea&s;ily perform: whenever, there|fore, their prey flies up the tree
from them, they can only follow it with their eyes, or watch its motions till
hunger again brings it to the ground. For this rea&s;on, the proper prey of the
dog kind, are only tho&s;e animals that, like them&s;elves, are unfitted for
climbing; the hare, the rabbit, the gazelle, or the roebuck.</P>
<P>As they are, in this re&s;pect, inferior to the cat, &s;o they
exceed it in the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling; by which alone they pur&s;ue their
prey with certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, wind it through all its 
<PB N="272" REF="319"> mazes, and tire it down by per&s;everance. It often
happens, however, in the &s;avage &s;tate, that their prey is either too much
dimini&s;hed, or too wary to &s;erve for a &s;ufficient &s;upply. In this
ca&s;e, when driven to an extremity, all the dog kinds can live for &s;ome time
upon fruits and vegetables, which, if they do not plea&s;e the appetite, at
lea&s;t &s;erve to appea&s;e their hunger.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, the Dog has every rea&s;on to claim the
preference, being the mo&s;t intelligent of all known quadrupedes, and the
acknow|ledged friend of mankind. The dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The re&s;t of
this de&s;cription of the dog is taken from Mr. Buffon: what I have added, is
marked as before.</NOTE>, inde|pendant of the beauty of his form, his vivacity,
force and &s;wiftne&s;s, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e in|ternal
qualifications that can conciliate the affections of man, and make the tyrant a
protector. A natural &s;hare of courage, an angry and ferocious
di&s;po&s;ition, renders the dog, in its &s;avage &s;tate, a formidable enemy
to all other animals: but the&s;e readily give way to very different qualities
in the dome&s;tic dog, who&s;e only ambition &s;eems the de&s;ire to plea&s;e;
he is &s;een to come crouching along, to lay his force, his courage, and all
his u&s;eful talents, at the feet of his ma&s;ter; he waits his orders, to 
<PB N="273" REF="320"> which he pays implicit obedience; he con&s;ults his
looks, and a &s;ingle glance is &s;ufficient to put him in motion; he is more
faithful even than the mo&s;t boa&s;ted among men; he is con&s;tant in his
affections, friendly without intere&s;t, and grateful for the &s;lighte&s;t
favours; much more mindful of benefits received, than injuries of|fered; he is
not driven off by unkindne&s;s; he &s;till continues humble, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive,
and implor|ing; his only hope to be &s;erviceable, his only terror to
di&s;plea&s;e; he licks the hand that has been ju&s;t lifted to &s;trike him,
and at la&s;t di&s;|arms re&s;entment, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive per&s;everance.</P>
<P>More docile than man, more obedient than any other animal, he is not
only in&s;tructed in a &s;hort time, but he al&s;o conforms to the
di&s;|po&s;itions and the manners of tho&s;e who com|mand him. He takes his
tone from the hou&s;e he inhabits; like the re&s;t of the dome&s;tics, he is
di&s;dainful among the great, and churli&s;h among clowns. Always a&s;&s;iduous
in &s;erving his ma&s;ter, and only a friend to his friends, he is indifferent
to all the re&s;t, and declares him&s;elf openly again&s;t &s;uch as &s;eem to
be dependant like him&s;elf. He knows a beggar by his cloaths, by his voice, or
his ge&s;tures, and forbids his approach. When at night the guard of the 
<PB N="274" REF="321"> hou&s;e is committed to his care, he &s;eems proud of
the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, he goes his rounds, &s;cents
&s;trangers at a di&s;tance, and gives them warning of his being upon duty. If
they attempt to break in upon his territories, he becomes more fierce, flies at
them, threatens, fights, and either conquers alone, or alarms tho&s;e who have
mo&s;t intere&s;t in coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; however, when he has
conquered, he quietly repo&s;es upon the &s;poil, and ab&s;tains from what he
has deterred others from abu&s;ing; giving thus at once a le&s;&s;on of
courage, temperance, and fidelity.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ee of what importance this animal is to us in a
&s;tate of nature. Suppo&s;ing, for a moment, that the &s;pecies had not
exi&s;ted, how could man, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the dog, have been
able to conquer, tame, and re|duce to &s;ervitude, every other animal? How
could he di&s;cover, chace, and de&s;troy, tho&s;e that were noxious to him? In
order to be &s;e|cure, and to become ma&s;ter of all animated nature, it was
nece&s;&s;ary for him to begin by making a friend of a part of them; to attach
&s;uch of them to him&s;elf, by kindne&s;s and ca|re&s;&s;es, as &s;eemed
fitte&s;t for obedience and active pur&s;uit. Thus the fir&s;t art employed by
man, was in conciliating the favour of the dog; and <PB N="275" REF="322"> the
fruits of this art were, the conque&s;t and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
earth.</P>
<P>The generality of animals have greater agi|lity, greater
&s;wiftne&s;s, and more formidable arms, from nature, than man; their
&s;en&s;es, and particularly that of &s;melling, are far more per|fect: they
having gained, therefore, a new a&s;&s;i&s;tant, particularly one who&s;e
&s;cent is &s;o ex|qui&s;ite as that of the dog, was the gaining a new
&s;en&s;e, a new faculty, which before was wanting. The machines and
in&s;truments which we have imagined for perfecting the re&s;t of the
&s;en&s;es, do not approach to that already prepared by nature, by which we are
enabled to find out every animal, though un&s;een, and thus de&s;troy the
noxious, and u&s;e the &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The dog, thus u&s;eful in him&s;elf, taken into a participation of
empire, exerts a degree of &s;uperiority over all animals that require human
protection. The flock and the herd obey his voice more readily even than that
of the &s;hep|herd or the herd&s;man; he conducts them, guards them, keeps them
from capriciou&s;ly &s;eeking danger, and their enemies he con&s;iders as his
own. Nor is he le&s;s u&s;eful in the pur&s;uit; when the &s;ound of the horn,
or the voice of the hunt&s;man calls him to the field, he te&s;tifies his
plea&s;ure by every little art, and pur&s;ues with <PB N="276" REF="323">
per&s;everance, tho&s;e animals, which, when taken, he mu&s;t not expect to
divide. The de&s;ire of hunting is indeed natural to him as well as to his
ma&s;ter, &s;ince war and the chace are the only employment of &s;avages. All
animals that live upon fle&s;h hunt by nature; the lion and the tiger, who&s;e
force is &s;o great that they are &s;ure to conquer, hunt alone and without
art; the wolf, the fox, and the wild dog, hunt in packs, a&s;&s;i&s;t each
other, and partake the &s;poil. But when education has perfected this talent in
the dome&s;tic dog, when he has been taught by man to repre&s;s his ardour, to
mea&s;ure his motions, and not to exhau&s;t his force by too &s;udden an
exertion of it, he then hunts with method, and always with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Although the wild dog, &s;uch as he was be|fore he
came under the protection of mankind, is at pre&s;ent utterly unknown, no
&s;uch animal being now to be found in any part of the world, yet there are
many that, from a dome&s;tic &s;tate, have turned &s;avage, and entirely
pur&s;ue the dictates of nature."</Q> In tho&s;e de&s;erted and uncultivated
countries where the dog is found wild, they &s;eem entirely to partake of the
di&s;|po&s;ition of the wolf; they unite in large bodies, and attack the mo&s;t
formidable animals of the fore&s;t, the cougar, the panther, and the bi&s;on. 
<PB N="277" REF="324"> In America, where they were originally brought by the
Europeans, and abandoned by their ma&s;ters, they have multiplied to &s;uch a
degree, that they &s;pread in packs over the whole country, attack all other
animals, and even man him&s;elf does not pa&s;s without in&s;ult. They are
there treated in the &s;ame manner as all other carnivorous animals, and killed
wher|ever they happen to come: however, they are ea&s;ily tamed: when taken
home, and treated with kindne&s;s and lenity, they quickly become
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and familiar, and continue faithfully attached to their
ma&s;ters. Different in this from the wolf or the fox, who, though taken never
&s;o young, are gentle only while cubs, and, as they grow older, give
them&s;elves up to their natural appetites of rapine and cruelty. In &s;hort,
it may be a&s;&s;erted, that the dog is the only animal who&s;e fidelity is
un&s;haken; the only one who knows his ma&s;ter, and the friends of the family;
the only one who in&s;tantly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes a &s;tranger; the only one who
knows his name, and an&s;wers to the dome&s;tic call; the only one who &s;eems
to under&s;tand the nature of &s;ubordination, and &s;eeks a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
the only one who, when he mi&s;&s;es his ma&s;ter, te&s;tifies his lo&s;s by
his complaints; the only one who, carried to a di&s;tant place, can find the
way <PB N="276" REF="325"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="277" REF="326"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="278" REF="327"> home; the only one who&s;e natural talents are evident,
and who&s;e education is always &s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, as the dog is of the mo&s;t complying
di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o al&s;o is it the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of change in its
form; the va|rieties of this animal being too many for even the mo&s;t careful
de&s;criber to mention. The climate, the food, and the education, all make
&s;trong impre&s;&s;ions upon the animal, and pro|duce alterations in its
&s;hape, its colour, its hair, its &s;ize, and in every thing but its nature.
The &s;ame dog, taken from one climate, and brought to another, &s;eems to
become another animal; but different breeds are as much &s;e|parated, to all
appearance, as any two animals the mo&s;t di&s;tinct in nature. Nothing appears
to continue con&s;tant with them, but their in|ternal conformation; different
in the figure of the body, in the length of the no&s;e, in the &s;hape of the
head, in the length and the di|rection of the ears and tail, in the colour, the
quality, and the quantity of the hair; in &s;hort, different in every thing but
that make of the parts which &s;erve to continue the &s;pecies, and keep the
animal di&s;tinct from all others. It is this peculiar conformation, this power
of pro|ducing an animal that can reproduce, that <PB N="279" REF="328"> marks
the kind, and approximates forms that at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem never made for
conjunction.</P>
<P>From this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, therefore, we may at once
pronounce all dogs to be of one kind; but which of them is the original of all
the re&s;t, which of them is the &s;avage dog from whence &s;uch a variety of
de&s;cendants have come down, is no ea&s;y matter to determine. We may ea&s;ily
indeed, ob&s;erve, that all tho&s;e ani|mals which are under the influence of
man, are &s;ubject to great variations. Such as have been &s;ufficiently
independant, &s;o as to chu&s;e their own climate, their own nouri&s;hment, and
to pur&s;ue their own habitudes, pre&s;erve the ori|ginal marks of nature,
without much devi|ation; and it is probable, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e is
even at this day very well repre&s;ented in their de&s;cendants. But &s;uch as
man has &s;ub|dued, tran&s;ported from one climate to another, controlled in
their manner of living, and their food, have mo&s;t probably been changed
al&s;o in their forms: particularly the dog has felt the&s;e alterations more
&s;trongly than any other of the dome&s;tic kinds; for living more like man, he
may be thus &s;aid to live more irregularly al&s;o, and, con&s;equently, mu&s;t
have felt all tho&s;e changes that &s;uch variety would naturally pro|duce.
Some other cau&s;es al&s;o may be a&s;&s;igned <PB N="280" REF="329"> for this
variety in the &s;pecies of the dog: as he is perpetually under the eye of his
ma&s;ter, when accident has produced any &s;ingularity in its productions, man
u&s;es all his art to continue this peculiarity unchanged; either by breeding
from &s;uch as had tho&s;e &s;ingularities, or by de|&s;troying &s;uch as
happened to want them; be|&s;ides, as the dog produces much more fre|quently
than &s;ome other animals, and lives a &s;horter time, &s;o the chance for its
varieties will be offered in greater proportion.</P>
<P>But which is the original animal, and which the artificial or
accidental variety, is a que&s;tion which, as was &s;aid, is not ea&s;ily
re&s;olved. If the internal &s;tructure of dogs of different &s;orts be
compared with each other, it will be found, except in point of &s;ize, that in
this re&s;pect they are exactly the &s;ame. This, therefore, affords no
criterion. If other animals be compared with the dog internally, the wolf and
the fox will be found to have the mo&s;t perfect re|&s;emblance; it is
probable, therefore, that the dog which mo&s;t nearly re&s;embles the wolf or
the fox externally, is the original animal of its kind: for it is natural to
&s;uppo&s;e, that as the dog mo&s;t nearly re&s;embles them internally, &s;o he
may be near them in external re&s;emblance al&s;o except where art or accident
has altered <PB N="281" REF="330"> his form. This being &s;uppo&s;ed, if we
look among the number of varieties to be found in the dog, we &s;hall not find
one &s;o like the wolf or the fox, as that which is called the Shepherd's Dog.
This is that dog with long coar&s;e hair on all parts except the no&s;e,
pricked ears, and a long no&s;e, which is common enough among us, and receives
his name from being prin|cipally u&s;ed in guarding and attending on &s;heep.
This &s;eems to be the primitive animal of his kind; and we &s;hall be the more
con|firmed in this opinion, if we attend to the different characters which
climate produces in this animal, and the different races of dogs which are
propagated in every country: and, in the fir&s;t place, if we examine tho&s;e
countries which are &s;till &s;avage, or but half civilized, where it is mo&s;t
probable the dog, like his ma&s;ter, has received but few impre&s;&s;ions from
art, we &s;hall find the &s;hepherd's dog, or one very like him, &s;till
prevailing among&s;t them. The dogs that have run wild in America, and in
Congo, approach this form. The dog of Siberia, Lapland, and Iceland, of the
Cape of Good Hope, of Madaga&s;car, Madura, Calicut, and Malabar, have all a
long no&s;e, pricked ears, and re&s;emble the &s;hepherd's dog very nearly. In
Guinea, the dog very &s;peedily takes <PB N="282" REF="331"> this form; for, at
the &s;econd or third gene|ration, the animal forgets to bark, his ears and his
tail become pointed, and his hair drops off, while a coar&s;er, thinner kind
comes in the place. This &s;ort of dog is al&s;o to be found in the tem|perate
climates in great abundance, particularly among tho&s;e who, prefering
u&s;efulne&s;s to beauty, employ an animal that requires very little
in&s;truction to be &s;erviceable. Notwith|&s;tanding this creature's
deformity, his melan|choly and &s;avage air, he is &s;uperior to all the re&s;t
of his kind in in&s;tinct; and, without any teaching, naturally takes to
tending flocks, with an a&s;&s;iduity and vigilance that at once
a&s;toni&s;hes, and yet relieves his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In more poli&s;hed and civilized places, the dog &s;eems to partake
of the univer&s;al refine|ment; and, like the men, becomes more beau|tiful,
more maje&s;tic, and more capable of a&s;|&s;uming an education foreign to his
nature. The dogs of Albany, of Greece, of Denmark, and of Ireland, are larger
and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of any other kind. In France, Germany, Spain, and
Italy, the dogs are of various kinds, like the men; and this variety &s;eems
formed by cro&s;&s;ing the breed of &s;uch as are imported from various
climates.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd's dog may, therefore, be con|&s;idered 
<PB N="283" REF="332"> as the primitive &s;tock from whence the&s;e varieties
are all derived. He makes the &s;tem of that genealogical tree which has been
branched out into every part of the world. This animal &s;till continues pretty
nearly in its original &s;tate among the poor in temperate climates; being
tran&s;ported into the colder re|gions, he grows le&s;s and more ugly among the
Laplanders; but becomes more perfect in Ice|land, Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, where
the climate is le&s;s rigorous, and the people more civilized. What|ever
differences there may be among the dogs of the&s;e countries, they are not very
con&s;ider|able, as they all have &s;trait ears, long and thick hair, a
&s;avage a&s;pect, and do not bark either &s;o often or &s;o loud as dogs of
the more cultivated kind.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd's dog, tran&s;ported into the temperate climates, and
among people entirely civilized, &s;uch as England, France, and Ger|many, will
be dive&s;ted of his &s;avage air, his pricked ears, his rough, long, and thick
hair, and, from the &s;ingle influence of climate and food alone, will become
either a Matin, a Ma&s;tiff, or an Hound. The&s;e three &s;eem the immediate
de&s;cendants of the former; and from them the other varieties are
produced.</P>
<P>The Hound, the Harrier, and the Beagle, <PB N="284" REF="333">
&s;eem all of the &s;ame kind; for although the bitch is covered but by one of
them, yet in her litters are found puppies re&s;embling all the three. This
animal, tran&s;ported into Spain or Barbary, where the hair of all quadrupedes
be|comes &s;oft and long, will be there converted into the land-&s;paniel, and
the water-&s;paniel, and the&s;e of different &s;izes.</P>
<P>The Grey Matin Hound, which is the &s;econd branch, tran&s;ported to
the north, becomes the great Dani&s;h dog; and this, &s;ent into the &s;outh,
becomes the grey-hound, of different &s;izes. The &s;ame, tran&s;ported into
Ireland, the Uk|raine, Tartary, Epirus, and Albania, becomes the great wolf
dog, known by the name of the Iri&s;h wolf dog.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;tiff, which is the third branch, and chiefly a native of
England, when tran&s;ported into Denmark, becomes the little Dani&s;h dog; and
this little Dani&s;h dog, &s;ent into the tropical and warm climates, becomes
the animal called the Turki&s;h dog, without hair. All the&s;e races, with
their varieties, are produced by the in|fluence of climate, joined to the
different food, education, and &s;helter, which they have received among
mankind. All other kinds may be con|&s;idered as mongrel races, produced by the
con|currence of the&s;e, and found rather by cro&s;&s;ing <PB N="285" REF="334"> the breed than by attending to the individual. 
<Q REND="inline">"As the&s;e are extremely numerous, and very
different in different countries, it would be al|mo&s;t endle&s;s to mention
the whole; be&s;ides, nothing but experience can a&s;certain the reality of
the&s;e conjectures already made, although they have &s;o much the appearance
of probability; and until that gives more certain information, we mu&s;t be
excu&s;ed from entering more minutely into the &s;ubject. 
<P>"With regard to the dogs of our country in particular, the
varieties are very great, and the number every day encrea&s;ing. And this
mu&s;t happen in a country &s;o open by commerce to all others, and where
wealth is apt to produce capricious predilection. Here the uglie&s;t and the
mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s of their kinds will be enter|tained merely for their
&s;ingularity; and, being imported only to be looked at, they will lo&s;e even
that &s;mall degree of &s;agacity which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their natural
climates. From this importation of foreign u&s;ele&s;s dogs, our own native
breed is, I am informed, greatly dege|nerated, and the varieties now to be
found in England much more numerous than they were in the times of Queen
Elizabeth, when Doctor Caius attempted their natural hi&s;tory. Some of the&s;e
he mentions are no longer to be found <PB N="286" REF="335"> among us, although
many have &s;ince been in|troduced, by no means &s;o &s;erviceable as tho&s;e
which have been &s;uffered to decay.</P> 
<P>"He divides the whole race into three kinds. The fir&s;t is, the
generous kind, which con&s;i&s;ts of the tarrier, the harrier, and the
blood-hound; the gaze-hound, the grey-hound, the leymmer, and the tumbler; all
the&s;e are u&s;ed for hunting. Then the &s;paniel, the &s;etter, and the
water-&s;paniel, or finder, were u&s;ed for fowling; and the &s;paniel, gentle,
or lap-dog, for amu&s;ement. The &s;econd is the farm kind; con&s;i&s;ting of
the &s;hepherd's dog and the ma&s;tiff. And the third is the mongrel kind;
con&s;i&s;ting of the wappe, the turn-&s;pit, and the dancer. To the&s;e
va|rieties we may add at pre&s;ent, the bull-dog, the Dutch ma&s;tiff, the
harlequin, the pointer, and the Dane, with a variety of lap-dogs, which, as
they are perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, may be con&s;idered as unworthy of a name.</P> 
<P>"The Tarrier is a &s;mall kind of hound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>, with rough hair, made
u&s;e of to force the fox or the badger out of their holes; or rather to give
notice, by their barking, in what part of their kennel the fox or badger
re&s;ides, when the &s;port&s;men intend to dig them out.</P> 
<P>"The Harrier, as well as the beagle and the <PB N="287" REF="336">
fox-hound are u&s;ed for hunting; of all other animals, they have the
quicke&s;t and mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hing &s;en&s;e of &s;melling. The properly
breeding, matching, and training the&s;e, make up the bu&s;ine&s;s of many
men's lives.</P> 
<P>"The Blood-hound was a dog of great u&s;e, and in high e&s;teem
among our ance&s;tors. Its employ was to recover any game that had e&s;caped
wounded from the hunter, or had been killed, and &s;tolen out of the fore&s;t.
But it was &s;till more employed in hunting thieves and rob|bers by their
foot&s;teps. At that time, when the country was le&s;s peopled than at
pre&s;ent, and when, con&s;equently, the foot&s;teps of one man were le&s;s
cro&s;&s;ed and obliterated by tho&s;e of others, this animal was very
&s;erviceable in &s;uch pur&s;uits; but at pre&s;ent, when the country is every
where peopled, this variety is quite worn out; probably becau&s;e it was found
of le&s;s &s;ervice than formerly.</P> 
<P>"The Gaze-hound hunted, like our grey-hounds, by the eye and not
by the &s;cent. It chaced indifferently the fox, hare, or buck. It would
&s;elect from the herd the fatte&s;t and faire&s;t deer, pur&s;ue it by the
eye, and if lo&s;t recover it again with amazing &s;agacity. This &s;pecies is
now lo&s;t or unknown among us.</P> 
<P>"The Grey-hound is very well known at pre|&s;ent, 
<PB N="288" REF="337"> and was formerly held in &s;uch e&s;timation, that it
was the peculiar companion of a gentle|man; who, in the times of
&s;emi-barbari&s;m, was known by his hor&s;e, his hawk, and his grey|hound.
Per&s;ons under a certain rank of life are forbidden, by &s;ome late game-laws,
from keep|ing this animal; wherefore, to di&s;gui&s;e it the better, they cut
off its tail.</P> 
<P>"The Leymmer is a &s;pecies now unknown to us. It hunted both by
&s;cent and &s;ight, and was led in a leyme or thong, from whence it received
its name.</P> 
<P>"The Tumbler was le&s;s than the hound, more &s;craggy, and had
pricked ears; &s;o that by the de&s;cription it &s;eems to an&s;wer to the
modern lurcher. This took its prey by mere cunning, depending neither on the
goodne&s;s of its no&s;e nor its &s;wiftne&s;s. If it came into a warren, it
neither barked nor ran on the rabbits; but, &s;eemingly inattentive, approached
&s;ufficiently near till it came within reach, and then &s;eized them by a
&s;udden &s;pring.</P> 
<P>"The Land Spaniel, which probably had its name from Spain, where
it might have ac|quired the &s;oftne&s;s of its hair, is well known at
pre&s;ent. There are two varieties of this kind; namely, the Slater, u&s;ed in
hawking to &s;pring the game; and the Setter, that crouches down 
<PB N="289" REF="338"> when it &s;cents the birds, till the net be drawn over
them. I have read &s;omewhere that the famous poet, Lord Surry, was the fir&s;t
who taught dogs to &s;et; it being an amu&s;ement to this day only known in
England.</P> 
<P>"The Water Spaniel was another &s;pecies u&s;ed in fowling. This
&s;eems to be the mo&s;t docile of all the dog kind; and this docility is
particularly owing to his natural attachment to man. Many other kinds will not
bear correc|tion; but this patient creature, though very fierce to &s;trangers,
&s;eems unalterable in his af|fections; and blows and ill u&s;age &s;eem only
to encrea&s;e his regard.</P> 
<P>"The Lap-dog, at the time of Doctor Caius, was of Malte&s;e breed;
at pre&s;ent it comes from different countries; in general, the more auk|ward
or extraordinary the&s;e are, the more they are prized.</P> 
<P>"The Shepherd's dog has been already men|tioned, and as for the
ma&s;tiff he is too common to require a de&s;cription. Doctor Caius tells us,
that three of the&s;e were reckoned a match for a bear, and four for a lion.
However, we are told that three of them overcame a lion in the times of King
James the Fir&s;t; two of them being di&s;abled in the combat, the third
obliged the lion to &s;eek for &s;afety by &s;light.</P> 
<P><PB N="290" REF="339">"As to the la&s;t divi&s;ion, namely, of the
Wappe, the Turn-&s;pit, and the Dancer, the&s;e were mongrels, of no certain
&s;hape, and made u&s;e of only to alarm the family, or, being taught a variety
of tricks, were carried about as a &s;how.</P> 
<P>"With regard to tho&s;e of later importation, the Bull-dog, as Mr.
Buffon &s;uppo&s;es, is a breed between the &s;mall Dane and the Engli&s;h
ma&s;tiff. The large Dane is the talle&s;t dog that is generally bred in
England. It is &s;omewhat between a ma&s;tiff and a grey-hound in &s;hape,
being more &s;lender than the one and much &s;tronger than the other. They are
chiefly u&s;ed rather for &s;hew than &s;ervice, being neither good in the yard
nor the field. The highe&s;t are mo&s;t e&s;teemed; and they generally cut off
their ears to improve their figure, as &s;ome ab&s;urdly &s;up|po&s;e. The
harlequin is not much unlike the &s;mall Dane, being an u&s;ele&s;s animal,
&s;omewhat between an Italian grey-hound and a Dutch ma&s;tiff. To the&s;e
&s;everal others might be added, &s;uch as the pug dog, the black breed, and
the pointer; but, in fact, the varieties are &s;o nu|merous as to fatigue even
the mo&s;t ardent cu|rio&s;ity."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Of the&s;e of the foreign kinds, I &s;hall mention only three, which
are more remarkable than any of the re&s;t. The Lion Dog greatly re|&s;embles 
<PB N="291" REF="340"> that animal, in miniature, from whence it takes the
name. The hair of the fore part of its body is extremely long, while that of
the hinder part is as &s;hort. The no&s;e is &s;hort, the tail long, and tufted
at the point, &s;o that in all the&s;e particulars it is entirely like the
lion. However, it differs very much from that fierce animal in nature and
di&s;po&s;ition, being one of the &s;malle&s;t animals of its kind, extremely
feeble, timid, and inactive. It comes originally from Malta, where it is found
&s;o &s;mall that women carry it about in their &s;leeves.</P>
<P>That animal fal&s;ely called the Turki&s;h Dog, differs greatly from
all the re&s;t of the kind, in being entirely without hair. The &s;kin, which
is perfectly bare, is of a fle&s;h colour, with brown &s;pots; and their figure
at fir&s;t view is rather di&s;gu&s;ting. The&s;e &s;eem to be of the &s;mall
Dani&s;h breed, brought into a warm climate, and there, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of generations, di|ve&s;ted of their hair. For this rea&s;on, they are
extremely chilly, and unable to endure the cold of our climate; and even in the
mid&s;t of &s;um|mer they continue to &s;hiver as we &s;ee men in a fro&s;ty
day. Their &s;pots are brown, as was &s;aid, well marked, and ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hable in &s;um|mer, but in the cold of winter they entirely
di&s;appear. They are called the Turki&s;h breed, <PB N="292" REF="341">
although brought from a much warmer climate; for &s;ome of them have been known
to come from the warme&s;t parts of Africa and the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The la&s;t variety, and the mo&s;t wonderful of all
that I &s;hall mention, is the Great Iri&s;h Wolf Dog; that may be con&s;idered
as the fir&s;t of the canine &s;pecies. This animal, which is very rare even in
the only country in the world where it is to be found, is rather kept for
&s;hew than u&s;e, there being neither wolves nor any other formidable bea&s;ts
of prey in Ireland, that &s;eem to require &s;o powerful an antagoni&s;t. The
wolf dog is therefore bred up in the hou&s;es of the great, or &s;uch gentlemen
as chu&s;e to keep him as a curio&s;ity, being neither good for hunt|ing the
hare, the fox, or the &s;tag, and equally un&s;erviceable as an hou&s;e dog.
Neverthele&s;s, he is extremely beautiful and maje&s;tic to ap|pearance, being
the greate&s;t of the dog kind to be &s;een in the world. The large&s;t of
tho&s;e I have &s;een, and I have &s;een above a dozen, was about four feet
high, or as tall as a calf of a year old. He was made extremely like a
grey|hound, but rather more robu&s;t, and inclining to the figure of the French
matin, or the great Dane. His eye was mild, his colour white, and his nature
&s;eemed heavy and phlegmatic. This I a&s;cribed to his having been bred up to
a <PB N="293" REF="342"> &s;ize beyond his nature; for we &s;ee in man, and all
other animals, that &s;uch as are overgrown are neither &s;o vigorous nor alert
as tho&s;e of more moderate &s;tature. The greate&s;t pains had been taken with
the&s;e to enlarge the breed, both by food and matching. This end was
ef|fectually obtained, indeed; for the &s;ize was enormous; but, as it &s;eemed
to me, at the ex|pence of the animal's fiercene&s;s, vigilance, and &s;agacity.
However, I was informed otherwi&s;e; the gentleman who bred them a&s;&s;uring
me that a ma&s;tiff would be nothing when oppo&s;ed to one of them, who
generally &s;eized their antagoni&s;t by the back: he added, that they would
worry the &s;tronge&s;t bull-dogs, in a few minutes, to death. But this
&s;trength did not appear either in their figure or their inclinations; they
&s;eemed rather more timid than the ordinary race of dogs; and their &s;kin was
much thinner, and con&s;equently le&s;s fitted for combat. Whether with the&s;e
di&s;|advantages they were capable, as I was told, of &s;ingly coping with
bears, others may deter|mine; however, they have but few oppor|tunities, in
their own country, of exerting their &s;trength, as all wild carnivorous
animals there are only of the vermin kind. Mr. Buffon &s;eems to be of opinion
that the&s;e are the true Molo&s;|&s;ian dogs of the ancients; he gives no
rea&s;on <PB N="294" REF="343"> for this opinion; and I am apt to think it ill
grounded. Not to trouble the reader with a tedious critical di&s;qui&s;ition,
which I have all along avoided, it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that

means the ca&s;e with the Iri&s;h wolf dog, who&s;e ears re&s;emble tho&s;e of
the grey-hound, and are far from fluctuating with the animal's motions. But of
whatever kinds the&s;e dogs may be, whether known among the ancients, or
whether produced by a later mixture, they are now almo&s;t quite worn away, and
are very rarely to be met with even in Ire|land. If carried to other countries,
they &s;oon degenerate; and even at home, unle&s;s great care be taken, they
quickly alter. They were once employed in clearing the i&s;land of wolves,
which infe&s;ted it in great plenty; but the&s;e being de&s;troyed, the dogs
al&s;o are wearing <PB N="295" REF="344"> away, as if Nature meant to blot out
the &s;pecies when they had no longer any &s;ervices to per|form. 
<P>"In this manner &s;everal kinds of animals fade from the face of
nature that were once well known, but are now &s;een no longer. The enormous
elk of the &s;ame kingdom, that, by its horns, could not have been le&s;s than
eleven feet high, the wolf, and even the wolf-dog, are extinct, or only
continued in &s;uch a manner as to prove their former plenty and exi&s;tence.
From hence it is probable that many of the nobler kinds of dogs, of which the
ancients have given us &s;uch beautiful de&s;criptions, are now utterly
unknown; &s;ince among the whole breed we have not one that will venture to
en|gage the lion or the tiger in &s;ingle combat. The Engli&s;h bull-dog is
perhaps the brave&s;t of the kind; but what are his mo&s;t boa&s;ted ex|ploits
to tho&s;e mentioned of the Epirotic dogs by Pliny, or the Indian dogs by
Aelian. The latter gives us a de&s;cription of a combat between a dog and a
lion, which I will take leave to tran&s;late.</P> 
<P>"When Alexander was pur&s;uing his conque&s;ts in India, one of
the principal men or that country was de&s;irous of &s;hewing him the value of
the dogs which his country produced. <PB N="296" REF="345"> Bringing his dog
into the king's pre&s;ence, he ordered a &s;tag to be let loo&s;e before him,
which the dog, de&s;pi&s;ing as an unworthy enemy, re|mained quite regardle&s;s
of the animal, and never once &s;tirred from his place. His ma&s;ter then
ordered a wild boar to be &s;et out; but the dog thought even this a
de&s;picable foe, and re|mained calm and regardle&s;s as before. He was next
tried with a bear; but &s;till de&s;pi&s;ing his ene|my, he only waited for an
object more worthy of his courage and his force. At la&s;t, they brought forth
a tremendous lion, and then the dog ac|knowledged his antagoni&s;t, and
prepared for combat. He in&s;tantly di&s;covered a degree of ungovernable
ardour; and, flying at the lion with fury, &s;eized him by the throat, and
totally di&s;abled him from re&s;i&s;tance Upon this, the Indian, who was
de&s;irous of &s;urprizing the king, and knowing the con&s;tancy and bravery of
his dog, ordered his tail to be cut off; which was ea&s;ily performed as the
bold animal was em|ployed in holding the lion. He next ordered one of his legs
to be broken; which, however, did not in the lea&s;t abate the dog's ardour,
but he &s;till kept his hold as before. Another leg was then broken; but the
dog, as if he had &s;uffered no pain, only pre&s;&s;ed the lion &s;till the
more. In this cruel manner, all his legs were <PB N="297" REF="346"> cut off,
without abating his courage; and at la&s;t, when even his head was &s;eparated
from his body, the jaws &s;eemed to keep their for|mer hold. A &s;ight &s;o
cruel did not fail to affect the king with very &s;trong emotions, at once
pitying the dog's fate and admiring his forti|tude. Upon which the Indian,
&s;eeing him thus moved, pre&s;ented him with four dogs of the &s;ame kind,
which in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated his unea&s;ine&s;s for the lo&s;s of the
former.</P> "The breed of dogs, however, in that country, is at pre&s;ent very
much inferior to what this &s;tory &s;eems to imply; &s;ince, in many places,
in&s;tead of dogs, they have animals of the cat kind for hunting. In other
places al&s;o, this ad|mirable and faithful animal, in&s;tead of being applied
to his natural u&s;es, is only kept to be eaten. All over China there are
dog-butchers, and &s;hambles appointed for &s;elling their fle&s;h. In Canton,
particularly, there is a &s;treet ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e; and what is
very ex|traordinary, wherever a dog-butcher appears, all the dogs of the place
are &s;ure to be in full cry after him; they know their enemy, and per&s;ecute
him as far as they are able."</Q> Along the coa&s;ts of Guinea, their fle&s;h
is e&s;teemed a delicacy by the Negroes; and they will give one of their cows
for a dog. But, among this bar|barous <PB N="298" REF="347"> and brutal people,
&s;carce any thing that has life comes ami&s;s; and they may well take up with
a dog, &s;ince they con&s;ider toads, lizards, and even the fle&s;h of the
tiger it&s;elf, as a dainty. It may perhaps happen that the fle&s;h of this
animal, which is &s;o indifferent in the temperate climates, may a&s;&s;ume a
better quality in tho&s;e which are more warm; but it is more than probable
that the diver&s;ity is ra|ther in man than in the fle&s;h of the dog; &s;ince
in the cold countries the fle&s;h is eaten with equal appetite by the
&s;avages; and they have their dog-fea&s;ts in the &s;ame manner as we have
ours for veni&s;on.</P>
<P>In our climate, the wild animals that mo&s;t approach the dog are
the wolf and the fox; the&s;e in their internal conformation greatly
re|&s;emble each other, and yet in their natures are very di&s;tinct. The
ancients a&s;&s;erted that they bred together; and I am a&s;&s;ured by credible
per&s;ons that there are many animals in this country bred between a dog and a
fox. How|ever, all the endeavours of Mr. Buffon to make them engender, as he
a&s;&s;ures us, were inef|fectual. For this purpo&s;e, he bred up a young wolf,
taken in the woods, at two months old, with a matin dog of the &s;ame age. They
were &s;hut up together, without any other, in a large <PB N="299" REF="348">
yard, where they had a &s;helter for retiring. They neither of them knew any
other indi|vidual of their kind, nor even any other man but he who had the
charge of feeding them. In this manner they were kept for three years; &s;till
with the &s;ame attention, and without con|&s;training or tying them up. During
the fir&s;t year the young animals played with each other continually, and
&s;eemed to love each other very much. In the &s;econd year they began to
di&s;pute about their victuals, although they were given more than they could
u&s;e. The quarrel always began on the wolf's &s;ide. They were brought their
food, which con&s;i&s;ted of fle&s;h and bones, upon a large wooden platter,
which was laid on the ground. Ju&s;t as it was put down, the wolf, in&s;tead of
falling to the meat, began by driving off the dog; and took the platter in his
teeth &s;o expertly, that he let nothing of what it con|tained fall upon the
ground; and in this man|ner carried it off; but as he could not entirely
e&s;cape, he was frequently &s;een to run with it round the yard five or &s;ix
times, &s;till carrying it in a po&s;ition that none of its contents could
fall. In this manner it would continue running, only now and then &s;topping to
take breath, until the dog coming up, the wolf would leave the victuals to
attack him. The dog, however, <PB N="300" REF="349"> was the &s;tronger of the
two; but as it was more gentle, in order to &s;ecure him from the wolf's
attack, he had a collar put round his neck. In the third year, the quarrels of
the&s;e ill paired a&s;&s;ociates were more vehement, and their com|bats more
frequent; the wolf, therefore, had a collar put about its neck, as well as the
dog, who began to be more fierce and unmerciful. During the two fir&s;t years,
neither &s;eemed to te&s;tify the lea&s;t tendency towards engendering; and it
was not till the end of the third, that the wolf, which was the female,
&s;hewed the natural de&s;ire, but without abating either in its fierce|ne&s;s
or ob&s;tinacy. This appetite rather en|crea&s;ed than repre&s;&s;ed their
mutual animo&s;ity; they became every day more intractable and ferocious, and
nothing was heard between them but the &s;ounds of rage and re&s;entment. They
both, in le&s;s than three weeks, became remark|ably lean, without ever
approaching each other, but to combat. At length, their quarrels be|came &s;o
de&s;perate, that the dog killed the wolf, who was become more weak and feeble;
and he was &s;oon after him&s;elf obliged to be killed, for, upon being &s;et
at liberty, he in&s;tantly flew upon every animal he met, fowls, dogs, and even
men them&s;elves not e&s;caping his &s;avage fury.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="350">The &s;ame experiment was tried upon foxes,
taken young, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s, they were never found to engender
with dogs; and our learned naturali&s;t &s;eems to be of opinion that their
natures are too oppo&s;ite ever to pro|voke mutual de&s;ire. One thing,
however, mu&s;t be remarked, that the animals on which he tried his
experiments, were rather too old when taken, and had partly acquired their
natural &s;avage appetites, before they came into his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. The
wolf, as he acknowledges, was two or three months old before it was caught, and
the foxes were taken in traps. It may, therefore, be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed,
that nothing could ever after thoroughly tame tho&s;e creatures, that had been
&s;uckled in the wild &s;tate, and had caught all the habitudes of the dam. I
have &s;een the&s;e animals, when taken earlier in the woods, become very tame;
and, indeed, they rather were di&s;plea&s;ing by being too familiar than too
&s;hy. It were to be wi&s;hed that the experiment were tried upon &s;uch as
the&s;e; and it is more than probable that it would produce the de&s;ired
&s;ucce&s;s. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e expe|riments are &s;ufficient to prove
that neither the wolf nor the fox are of the &s;ame nature with the dog, but
each of a &s;pecies perfectly di&s;tinct, <PB N="302" REF="351"> and their
joint produce mo&s;t probably un|fruitful.</P>
<P>The dog, when fir&s;t whelped, is not a com|pletely fini&s;hed
animal. In this kind, as in all the re&s;t which bring forth many at a time,
the young are not &s;o perfect as in tho&s;e which bring forth but one or two.
They are always produced with the eyes clo&s;ed, the lids being held together,
not by &s;ticking, but by a kind of thin membrane, which is torn as &s;oon as
the upper eye-lid becomes &s;trong enough to rai&s;e it from the under. In
general, their eyes are not opened till ten or twelve days old. Dur|ing that
time, the bones of the &s;cull are not completed, the body is puffed up, the
no&s;e is &s;hort, and the whole form but ill &s;ketched out. In le&s;s than a
month the puppy begins to u&s;e all its &s;en&s;es; and, from thence, makes
ha&s;ty advances to its perfection. At the fourth month the dog lo&s;es &s;ome
of his teeth, as in other animals, and the&s;e are renewed by &s;uch as never
fall. The number of the&s;e amount to forty-two, which is twelve more than is
found in any of the cat kind, which are known never to have above thirty. The
teeth of the dog being his great and only weapon, are formed in a manner much
more &s;erviceable than tho&s;e of the former; and there is &s;carce any
quadru|pede <PB N="303" REF="352"> that has a greater facility in rending,
cutting, or chewing its food. He cuts with his inci&s;ors, or fore-teeth, he
holds with his four great canine teeth, and he chews his meat with his
grinders; the&s;e are fourteen in number, and &s;o placed that, when the jaws
are &s;hut, there remains a di&s;tance between them, &s;o that the dog, by
opening his mouth ever &s;o wide, does not lo&s;e the power of his jaws. But it
is other|wi&s;e in the cat kind, who&s;e inci&s;ors or cutting teeth are very
&s;mall, and who&s;e grinding teeth, when brought together, touch more
clo&s;ely than tho&s;e of the dog, and, con&s;equently, have le&s;s power.
Thus, for in&s;tance, I can &s;queeze any thing more forcibly between my thumb
and fore finger, where the di&s;tance is greater, than between any other two
fingers, who&s;e di&s;tance from each other is le&s;s.</P>

are le&s;s delicate in their food; and yet there are many kinds of birds which
the dog will not venture to touch. He is even known, although in a &s;avage
&s;tate, to ab&s;tain from injuring &s;ome which one might &s;uppo&s;e he had
every rea&s;on to oppo&s;e. The dogs and the vultures which live wild about
Grand Cairo in Egypt, (for the Mahometan law has expelled this u&s;eful animal
from human &s;ociety) continue together in a very &s;ociable and friendly
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t Her. Palae&s;tin, p.
232.</BIBL></NOTE>. As they are both u&s;eful in devouring &s;uch carca&s;es as
might otherwi&s;e pu|trefy, and thus infect the air, the inhabitants &s;upply
them with provi&s;ions every day, in order to keep them near the city. Upon
the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, the quadrupedes and birds are often &s;een together
tearing the &s;ame piece of fle&s;h, without the lea&s;t enmity; on the
contrary, they are known to live together with a kind of af|fection, and bring
up their young in the &s;ame ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Although the dog is a voracious animal, yet he can bear hunger for a
very long time. We have an in&s;tance, in the Memoirs of the Aca|demy of
Sciences, of this kind, in which a bitch that had been forgotten in a
country-hou&s;e, lived forty days, without any other nouri&s;hment 
<PB N="305" REF="354"> than the wool of a quilt which &s;he had torn in pieces.
It &s;hould &s;eem that water is more ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the dog than food; he
drinks often, though not abundantly; and it is commonly be|lieved, that when
abridged in water, he runs mad. This dreadful malady, the con&s;equences of
which are &s;o well known, is the greate&s;t in|convenience that re&s;ults from
the keeping this faithful dome&s;tic. But it is a di&s;order by no means &s;o
frequent as the terrors of the ti|morous would &s;uppo&s;e; the dog has been
often accu&s;ed of madne&s;s, without a fair trial; and &s;ome per&s;ons have
been &s;uppo&s;ed to receive their deaths from his bite, when either their own
ill-grounded fears, or their natural di&s;|orders were the true cau&s;e.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE WOLF.</HEAD>
<P>THE dog and the wolf are &s;o very much alike internally, that the
mo&s;t expert anatomi&s;ts can &s;carce perceive the difference; and it may be
a&s;&s;erted al&s;o, that, externally, &s;ome dogs more nearly re&s;emble the
wolf than they do each other. It was this &s;trong &s;imilitude that fir&s;t
led &s;ome naturali&s;ts to con&s;ider them as the &s;ame animal, and to look
upon the wolf as the dog in its &s;tate of &s;avage freedom: however, 
<PB N="306" REF="355"> this opinion is entertained no longer; the na|tural
antipathy tho&s;e two animals bear to each other; the longer time which the
wolf goes with young than the dog, the one going over an hundred days, and the
other not quite &s;ixty; the longer period of life in the former than the
latter, the wolf living twenty years, the dog not fifteen; all &s;ufficiently
point out a di|&s;tinction, and draw a line that mu&s;t for ever keep them
a&s;under.</P>
<P>The wolf, from the tip of the no&s;e, to the in&s;ertion of the
tail, is about three feet &s;even inches long, and about two feet five inches
high; which &s;hews him to be larger than our great breed of ma&s;tiffs, which
are &s;eldom found to be above three feet by two. His colour is a mixture of
black, brown, and grey, extremely rough and hard, but mixed towards the roots
with a kind of a&s;h coloured fur. In comparing him to any of our well known
breed of dogs, the great Dane, or mongrel greyhound, for in|&s;tance, he will
appear to have the legs &s;horter, the head larger, the muzzle thicker, the
eyes &s;maller and more &s;eparated from each other, and the ears &s;horter and
&s;traiter. He appears, in every re&s;pect, &s;tronger than the dog; and the
length of his hair contributes &s;till more to his robu&s;t appearance. The
feature which prin|cipally <PB N="307" REF="356"> di&s;tingui&s;hes the
vi&s;age of the wolf from that of the dog, is the eye, which opens
&s;lant|ingly upwards, in the &s;ame direction with the no&s;e; whereas, in the
dog, it opens more at right angles with the no&s;e, as in man. The tail al&s;o,
in this animal, is long and bu&s;hy; and he carries it rather more between his
hind legs than the dog is &s;een to do. The colour of the eye-balls in the wolf
are of a fiery green, and give his vi&s;age a fierce and formidable air, which
his natural di&s;po&s;ition does by no means contradict<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The re&s;t of this hi&s;tory of the wolf is taken from Mr. Buffon,
and I look upon it as a complete model for natural hi&s;tory. If I add or
differ, I mark it as u&s;ual.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wolf is one of tho&s;e animals who&s;e ap|petite for animal
food is the mo&s;t vehement; and who&s;e means of &s;atisfying this appetite
are the mo&s;t various. Nature has furni&s;hed him with &s;trength, cunning,
agility, and all tho&s;e requi&s;ites which fit an animal for pur&s;uing,
overtaking, and conquering its prey; and yet, with all the&s;e, the wolf mo&s;t
frequently dies of hunger, for he is the declared enemy of man. Being long
pro&s;cribed, and a reward offered for his head, he is obliged to fly from
human habitations, and to live in the fore&s;t, where the few wild animals to
be found there, e&s;cape him <PB N="308" REF="357"> either by their
&s;wiftne&s;s or their art; or are &s;up|plied in too &s;mall a proportion to
&s;atisfy his rapacity. He is naturally dull and cowardly; but frequently
di&s;appointed, and as often re|duced to the verge of famine, he becomes
in|genious from want, and courageous from ne|ce&s;&s;ity. When pre&s;&s;ed with
hunger, he braves danger, and comes to attack tho&s;e animals which are under
the protection of man, parti|cularly &s;uch as he can readily carry away,
lambs, &s;heep, or even dogs them&s;elves, for all animal food comes then
equally agreeable. When this excur&s;ion has &s;ucceeded, he often returns to
the charge, until having been wounded or hard pre&s;&s;ed by the dogs, or the
&s;hepherds, he hides him&s;elf by day in the thicke&s;t coverts, and only
ventures out at night; he then &s;allies forth over the country, keeps peering
round the villages, carries off &s;uch animals as are not under protection,
at|tacks the &s;heep-folds, &s;cratches up and under|mines the thre&s;holds of
doors where they are hou&s;ed, enters furious, and de&s;troys all before he
begins to &s;ix upon and carry off his prey. When the&s;e &s;allies do not
&s;ucceed, he then re|turns to the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t, content to
pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;maller animals, which, even when taken, afford him but a
&s;canty &s;upply. <PB N="309" REF="358"> He there goes regularly to work,
follows by the &s;cent, opens to the view, &s;till keeps follow|ing, hopele&s;s
him&s;elf of overtaking the prey, but expecting that &s;ome other wolf will
come into his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then content to &s;hare the &s;poil. At
la&s;t, when his nece&s;&s;ities are very urgent, he boldly faces certain
de&s;truction; he attacks women and children, and &s;ometimes ventures even to
fall upon men, becomes furious by his continual agitations, and ends his life
in madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The wolf, as well externally as internally, &s;o nearly
re&s;embles the dog, that he &s;eems mo|delled upon the &s;ame plan; and yet he
only offers the rever&s;e of the medal. If his form be like, his nature is &s;o
different, that he only pre&s;erves the ill qualities of the dog, without any
of his good ones. Indeed, they are &s;o different in their di&s;po&s;itions,
that no two animals can have a more perfect antipathy to each other. A young
dog &s;hudders at the &s;ight of a wolf; he even &s;huns his &s;cent, which,
though unknown, is &s;o repugnant to his nature, that he comes trembling to
take protection near his ma&s;ter. A dog who is &s;tronger, and who knows his
&s;trength, bri&s;tles up at the &s;ight, te&s;tifies his animo&s;ity, attacks
him with courage, endeavours to put him to &s;light, and does all in his power 
<PB N="310" REF="359"> to rid him&s;elf of a pre&s;ence that is hateful to him.
They never meet without either flying or fight|ing; fighting for life and
death, and without mercy on either &s;ide. If the wolf is the &s;tronger, he
tears and devours his prey: the dog, on the contrary, is more generous, and
contents him&s;elf with his victory; he does not &s;eem to think that 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>the body of a dead enemy &s;mells
well;</HI></Q> he leaves him where he falls, to &s;erve as food for birds of
prey, or for other wolves, &s;ince they devour each other; and when one wolf
happens to be de&s;perately wounded, the re&s;t track him by his blood, and are
&s;ure to &s;hew him no mercy.</P>
<P>The dog, even in his &s;avage &s;tate, is not cruel; he is
ea&s;ily tamed, and continues firmly attached to his ma&s;ter. The wolf, when
taken young, becomes tame, but never has an at|tachment; nature is &s;tronger
in him than edu|cation; he re&s;umes, with age, his natural di&s;|po&s;itions,
and returns, as &s;oon as he can, to the woods from whence he was taken. Dogs,
even of the dulle&s;t kinds, &s;eek the company of other animals; they are
naturally di&s;po&s;ed to follow and accompany other creatures be&s;ide
them|&s;elves; and even by in&s;tinct, without any edu|cation, take to the care
of flocks and herds. The wolf, on the contrary, is the enemy of all 
<PB N="311" REF="360"> &s;ociety; he does not even keep much company with
tho&s;e of his kind. When they are &s;een in packs together, it is not to be
con&s;idered as a peaceful &s;ociety, but a combination for war: they te&s;tify
their ho&s;tile intentions by their loud howlings, and by their fiercene&s;s
di&s;cover a pro|ject for attacking &s;ome great animal, &s;uch as a &s;tag or
a bull, or to de&s;troy &s;ome more redoubt|able watch-dog. The in&s;tant their
military ex|pedition is completed, their &s;ociety is at an end; they then
part, and each returns in &s;ilence to his &s;olitary retreat. There is not
even any &s;trong attachments between the male and female; they &s;eek each
other only once a year, and re|main but a few days together: they always couple
in winter; at which time &s;everal males are &s;een following one female, and
this a&s;&s;ociation is &s;till more bloody than the former: they di&s;|pute
mo&s;t cruelly, growl, bark, fight, and tear each other; and it &s;ometimes
happens that the majority kill the wolf which has been chiefly preferred by the
female. It is u&s;ual for the &s;he wolf to fly from them all with him &s;he
has cho&s;en; and watches this opportunity when the re&s;t are a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for coupling does not continue above twelve or
fifteen days; and u&s;ually com|mences among the olde&s;t, tho&s;e which are 
<PB N="312" REF="361"> young being later in their de&s;ires. The males have no
fixed time for engendering; they pa&s;s from one female to the other, beginning
at the end of December, and ending at the latter end of February. The time of
pregnancy is about three months and an half; and the young wolves are found
from the latter end of April to the beginning of July. The long continuance of
the wolf's pregnancy is &s;ufficient to make a di&s;tinction between it and the
dog; did not al&s;o the fiery fiercene&s;s of the eyes, the howl in&s;tead of
barking, and the greater duration of its life, leave no doubt of its being an
animal of its own particular &s;pecies. In other re&s;pects, however, they are
entirely alike; the wolf couples exactly like the dog, the parts are formed in
the &s;ame manner, and their &s;eparation hindered by the &s;ame cau&s;e. When
the &s;he-wolves are near their time of bringing forth, they &s;eek &s;ome very
tufted &s;pot, in the thicke&s;t part of the fo|re&s;t; in the middle of this
they make a &s;mall opening, cutting away the thorns and briars with their
teeth, and afterwards carry thither a great quantity of mo&s;s, which they form
into a bed for their young ones. They generally bring forth five or &s;ix, and
&s;ometimes even to nine at a litter. The cubs are brought forth, like tho&s;e
of the bitch, with the eyes clo&s;ed; <PB N="313" REF="362"> the dam &s;uckles
them for &s;ome weeks, and teaches them betimes to eat fle&s;h, which &s;he
prepares for them, by chewing it fir&s;t her&s;elf. Some time after &s;he
brings them &s;tronger food, hares, partridges, and birds yet alive. The young
wolves begin by playing with them, and end by killing them. The dam then
&s;trips them of their feathers, tears them in pieces, and gives to each of
them a &s;hare. They do not leave the den where they have been littered, till
they are &s;ix weeks, or two months old. They then follow the old one, who
leads them to drink to the trunk of &s;ome old tree where the water has
&s;ettled, or at &s;ome pool in the neigh|bourhood. If &s;he apprehends any
danger, &s;he in&s;tantly conceals them in the fir&s;t convenient place, or
brings them back to their former retreat. In this manner they follow her for
&s;ome months; when they are attacked, &s;he de|fends them with all her
&s;trength, and more than u&s;ual ferocity. Although, at other times, more
timorous than the male, at that &s;ea&s;on &s;he becomes bold and fearle&s;s;
willing perhaps to teach the young ones future courage by her own example. It
is not till they are about ten or twelve months old, and until they have &s;hed
their fir&s;t teeth, and completed the new, that &s;he thinks them in a
capacity to &s;hift for them|&s;elves. <PB N="314" REF="363"> Then when they
have acquired arms from nature, and have learned indu&s;try and courage from
her example, &s;he declines all future care of them, being again engaged in
bringing up a new progeny.</P>
<P>The males and females are in a capacity to engender when two years
old. It is probable that the females of this &s;pecies, as well as of mo&s;t
others, are &s;ooner completed than the males; but this is certain, that they
never de&s;ire to copulate until their &s;econd winter; from whence we may
&s;uppo&s;e that they live fifteen or twenty years; for allowing three years
for their complete growth, this multiplied by &s;even gives them a life of
twenty-one; mo&s;t animals, as has been ob&s;erved, living about &s;even times
the number of years which they take to come to perfection. Of this, however,
there is as yet no certainty, no more than of what hunt&s;|men a&s;&s;ert, that
in all the litters there are more males than females. From them al&s;o we learn
that there are &s;ome of the males who attach them&s;elves to the female, who
accompany her during her ge&s;tation, until the time of bringing forth, when
&s;he hides the place of her retreat from the male, le&s;t he &s;hould devour
her cubs. But after this, when they are brought forth, that the then takes the
&s;ame care of them as the <PB N="315" REF="364"> female, carries them
provi&s;ions, and, if the dam &s;hould happen to be killed, rears them up in
her &s;tead.</P>
<P>The wolf grows grey as he grows old, and his teeth wear, like
tho&s;e of mo&s;t other ani|mals, by u&s;ing. He &s;leeps when his belly is
full, or when he is fatigued, rather by day than night; and always, like the
dog, is very ea&s;ily waked. He drinks frequently; and in times of drought,
when there is no water to be found in the trunks of old trees, or in the pools
about the fore&s;t, he comes often, in the day, down to the brooks, or the
lakes in the plain. Although very voracious, he &s;upports hunger for a long
time, and often lives four or five days without food, provided he be &s;upplied
with water.</P>
<P>The wolf has great &s;trength, particularly in his fore-parts, in
the mu&s;cles of his neck and his jaws. He carries off a &s;heep in his mouth
without letting it touch the ground, and runs with it much &s;wifter than the
&s;hepherds who pur&s;ue him; &s;o that nothing but the dogs can overtake, and
oblige him to quit his prey. He bites cruelly, and always with greater
vehe|mence in proportion as he his lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ted; for he u&s;es
precautions with &s;uch animals as attempt to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive. He
is ever cow|ardly, <PB N="316" REF="365"> and never fights but when under a
ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;atisfying hunger, or making good his retreat. When he is
wounded by a bullet, he is heard to cry out; and yet, when &s;ur|rounded by the
pea&s;ants, and attacked with clubs, he never howls as the dog under
correc|tion, but defends him&s;elf in &s;ilence, and dies as hard as he
lived.</P>
<P>His nature is, in fact, more &s;avage than that of the dog; he has
le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility and greater &s;trength. He travels, runs, and keeps
plun|dering for whole days and nights together. He is in a manner
indefatigable; and perhaps of all animals he is the mo&s;t difficult to be
hunted down. The dog is good natured and coura|geous; the wolf, though
&s;avage, is ever fearful. If he happens to be caught in a pit-fall, he is for
&s;ome time &s;o frightened and a&s;toni&s;hed, that he may be killed without
offering to re&s;i&s;t, or taken alive without much danger. At that in&s;tant,
one may clap a collar round his neck, muzzle him, and drag him along, without
his ever giving the lea&s;t &s;igns of anger or re&s;ent|ment. At all other
times he has his &s;en&s;es in great perfection; his eye, his car, and
parti|cularly his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which is even &s;u|perior to the two
former. He &s;mells a carca&s;e at more than a league's di&s;tance; he al&s;o
per|ceives <PB N="317" REF="366"> living animals a great way off, and fol|lows
them a long time upon the &s;cent. When|ever he leaves the wood, he always
takes care to go out again&s;t the wind. When ju&s;t come to its extremity, he
&s;tops to examine, by his &s;mell, on all &s;ides, the emanations that may
come either from his enemy or his prey, which he very nicely di&s;tingui&s;hes.
He prefers tho&s;e animals which he kills him&s;elf to tho&s;e he finds dead;
and yet he does not di&s;dain the&s;e when no better is to be had. He is
particularly fond of human fle&s;h; and perhaps, if he were &s;uf|ficiently
powerful, he would eat no other. Wolves have been &s;een following armies, and
arriving in numbers upon the field of battle, where they devoured &s;uch dead
bodies as were left upon the field, or but negligently interred. The&s;e, when
once accu&s;tomed to human fle&s;h, ever after &s;eek particularly to attack
mankind, and chu&s;e to fall upon the &s;hepherd rather than his flock. We have
had a late in&s;tance of two or three of the&s;e keeping a whole province, for
more than a month, in a continual alarm.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that a whole country is called out to
extirpate the&s;e mo&s;t dangerous invaders. The hunting the wolf is a
favourite diver&s;ion among the great of &s;ome countries; and it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t <PB N="318" REF="367"> u&s;eful of
any. The&s;e animals are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the hunt&s;men into the <HI>young
wolf,</HI> the <HI>old wolf,</HI> and the <HI>great wolf.</HI> They are known
by the prints of their feet; the older the wolf, the larger the track he
leaves. That of the female is narrower and longer than that of the male. It is
nece&s;&s;ary to have a very good &s;tarter to put up the wolf; and it is even
convenient to u&s;e every art to encourage him in his pur&s;uit; for all dogs
have a natural repugnance again&s;t this animal, and are but cold in their
endeavours. When the wolf is once put up, it is then proper to have grey-hounds
to let fly at him, in lea&s;hes, one after the other. The fir&s;t lea&s;h is
&s;ent after him in the beginning, &s;econded by a man on hor&s;e-back; the
&s;econd are let loo&s;e about half a mile farther, and the third when the
re&s;t of the dogs come up with, and begin to bait him. He for a long time
keeps them off, &s;tands his ground, threatens them on all &s;ides, and often
gets away; but u&s;ually the hunters arriving come in aid of the dog, and help
to di&s;patch him with their cutla&s;&s;es. When the animal is killed, the dogs
te&s;tify no appetite to enjoy their victory, but leave him where he falls, a
frightful &s;pectacle, and even in death hideous.</P>
<P>The wolf is &s;ometimes al&s;o hunted with har|riers, but as he
always goes &s;traight forward, <PB N="319" REF="368"> and often holds his
&s;peed for a whole day toge|ther, this kind of chace is tedious and
di&s;agree|able, at lea&s;t if the harriers are not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by grey
hounds, who may harra&s;s him at every view. Several other arts have been
al&s;o u&s;ed to take and de&s;troy this noxious animal. He is &s;ur|rounded
and wounded by men and large hou&s;e-dogs; he is &s;ecured in traps; he is
poi&s;oned by carca&s;es prepared and placed for that purpo&s;e, and is caught
in pit-falls. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ge&s;ner tells us of a friar, a woman, and a
wolf, being taken in one of the&s;e, all in the &s;ame night. The woman lo&s;t
her &s;en&s;es with the fright, the friar his re|putation, and the wolf his
life."</Q> All the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, however, do not prevent this animal's
multiplying in great numbers, particularly in countries where the woods are
plenty. France, Spain, and Italy, are great infe&s;ted with them; but England,
Ireland, and Scotland, are hap|pily &s;et free.</P>
<P>King Edgar is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who at|tempted to rid this
kingdom of &s;uch di&s;agree|able inmates, by commuting the puni&s;hment for
certain crimes into the acceptance of a number of wolf's tongues from each
criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, p. 62.</BIBL></NOTE>.
However, &s;ome centuries after, the&s;e animals were again encrea&s;ed to
&s;uch a degree, as to become the <PB N="320" REF="369"> object of royal
attention; accordingly Edward the Fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued out his mandate to one
Peter Corbet to &s;uperintend and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the de&s;truc|tion of them.
They are &s;aid to have infe&s;ted Ireland long after they were extirpated in
Eng|land; however, the olde&s;t men in that country remember nothing of the&s;e
animals; and it is probable that there have been none there for more than a
century pa&s;t. Scotland al&s;o is to|tally free.</P>
<P>The colour of this animal differs according to the different
climates where it is bred, and often changes even in the &s;ame country.
Be&s;ide the common wolves, which are found in France and Germany, there are
others with thicker hair, inclining to yellow. The&s;e are more &s;a|vage and
le&s;s noxious than the former, neither approaching the flocks nor habitations,
and living rather by the chace than rapine. In the northern climates they are
found &s;ome quite black, and &s;ome white all over. The former are larger and
&s;tronger than tho&s;e of any other kinds.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies is very much diffu&s;ed in every part of the world,
being found in A&s;ia, Africa, and in America, as well as Europe. The wolves of
Senegal re&s;emble tho&s;e of France, except that they are larger and much
fiercer than tho&s;e <PB N="321" REF="370"> of Europe. Tho&s;e of Egypt are
&s;maller than tho&s;e of Greece. In the ea&s;t, the wolf is trained up for a
&s;hew, being taught to dance and play tricks; and one of the&s;e thus educated
often &s;ells for four or five hundred crowns. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is &s;aid that in Lapland the wolf will never
attack a rein-deer that is &s;een haltered; for this wary animal, being well
acquainted with the nature of a trap, &s;u&s;pects one wherever it perceives a
rope. However, when he &s;ees the deer entirely at liberty, he &s;eldom fails
to de&s;troy it. 
<P>"The wolf of North America is blacker and much le&s;s than
tho&s;e in other parts of the world, and approaches nearer in form to the dog
than tho&s;e of the ordinary kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brookes's
Natural Hi&s;tory, vol. 1. p. 198.</BIBL></NOTE>. In fact, they were made u&s;e
of as &s;uch by the &s;avages till the Europeans introduced others; and even
now, on the remoter &s;hores, or the more inland parts of the country, the
&s;avages &s;till make u&s;e of the&s;e animals in hunting. They are very tame
and gentle; and tho&s;e of this kind that are wild are neither &s;o large nor
&s;o fierce as an European wolf, nor do they ever attack mankind. They go
together in large packs by night to hunt the deer, which they do as well as any
dogs in England; and it is confidently a&s;&s;erted that one 
<PB N="322" REF="371"> of them is &s;ufficient to run down a deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Dictionaire Rai&s;on&eacute;e. Loup.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whenever
they are &s;een along the banks of tho&s;e rivers near which the wandering
natives pitch their huts, it is taken for granted that the bi&s;on or the deer
are not far off; and the &s;avages affirm that the wolves come with the
tidings, in order to have the garbage, after the animal has been killed by the
hunters. Cate&s;by adds a circum&s;tance relative to the&s;e ani|mals, which,
if true, invalidates many of Mr. Buffon's ob&s;ervations in the foregoing
hi&s;tory. He a&s;&s;erts, that the&s;e being the only dogs u&s;ed by the
Americans, before the arrival of the Europeans among them, they have &s;ince
en|gendered together, and that their breed has become prolific; which proves
the dog and the wolf to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies. It were to be wi&s;hed that
this fact were better a&s;certained; we &s;hould then know to a certainty in
what a degree the dog and wolf re&s;emble each other, as well in nature as in
conformation; we might then, perhaps, be enabled to improve the breed of our
dogs, by bringing them back to their native forms and in&s;tincts; we might, by
cro&s;&s;ing the &s;train, re&s;tore that race of tho&s;e bold animals, which
the ancients a&s;&s;ure us were more than a match for the lion."</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>THE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fox very exactly re&s;embles the wolf and the dog internally;
and, although he differs greatly from both in &s;ize and carriage, yet when we
come to examine his &s;hapes minutely, there will appear to be very little
difference in the de&s;cription. Were, for in&s;tance, a painter to draw from a
natural hi&s;torian's exacte&s;t de|&s;cription the figure of a dog, a wolf,
and a fox, without having ever &s;een either, he would be very apt to confound
all the&s;e animals together; or rather he would be unable to catch tho&s;e
pe|culiar <PB N="324" REF="376"> out-lines that no de&s;cription can &s;upply.
Words will never give any per&s;on an exact idea of forms any way irregular;
for although they be extremely ju&s;t and preci&s;e, yet the number|le&s;s
di&s;criminations to be attended to will con|found each other, and we &s;hall
no more conceive the preci&s;e form than we &s;hould be able to tell when one
pebble more was added or taken away from a thou&s;and. To conceive, therefore,
how the fox differs in form from the wolf or the dog, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;ee all three, or at lea&s;t to &s;upply the defects of de&s;cription by
ex|amining the difference in a print.</P>
<P>The fox is of a &s;lenderer make than the wolf, and not near &s;o
large; for as the former is above three feet and a half long, &s;o the other is
not above two feet three inches. The tail of the fox al&s;o is longer in
proportion and more bu&s;hy; its no&s;e is &s;maller and approaching more
nearly to that of the grey-hound, and its hair &s;ofter. On the other hand, it
differs from the dog in having its eyes obliquely &s;ituated, like tho&s;e of
the wolf; its ears are directed al&s;o in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the
wolf, and its head is equally large in proportion to its &s;ize. It differs
&s;till more from the dog in its &s;trong offen&s;ive &s;mell, which is
peculiar to the &s;pecies, and often the cau&s;e of their death. However,
&s;ome are igno|rantly of opinion that it will keep off infectious 
<PB N="325" REF="377"> di&s;ea&s;es, and they pre&s;erve this animal near their
habitations for that very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The fox has &s;ince the beginning been famous for his cunning and
his arts, and he partly merits his reputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, Renard.</BIBL></NOTE>. Without attempting to
op|po&s;e either the dogs or the &s;hepherds, without attacking the flock, or
alarming the village, he finds an ea&s;ier way to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and gains by
his addre&s;s what is denied to his &s;trength or courage. Patient and prudent,
he waits the opportunity for depredation, and varies his con|duct with every
occa&s;ion. His whole &s;tudy is his pre&s;ervation; although nearly as
indefati|gable, and actually more &s;wift than the wolf, he does not entirely
tru&s;t to either, but makes him&s;elf an a&s;ylum, to which he retires in
ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; where he &s;helters him&s;elf from dan|ger, and brings
up his young.</P>
<P>As among men, tho&s;e who lead a dome&s;tic life are more
civilized and more endued with wi&s;dom than tho&s;e who wander from place to
place, &s;o, in the inferior ranks of animated na|ture, the taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an home &s;uppo&s;es a degree of in&s;tinct which others
are without<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
choice of the &s;ituation for this domicil, the art of making it convenient, of
hiding its entrance, and &s;ecuring it again&s;t more powerful 
<PB N="326" REF="378"> animals, are all &s;o many marks of &s;uperior &s;kill
and indu&s;try. The fox is furni&s;hed with both, and turns them to his
advantage. He generally keeps his kennel at the edge of the wood, and yet
within an ea&s;y journey of &s;ome neighbouring cottage. From thence he
li&s;tens to the crowing of the cock, and the cackling of the dome&s;tic fowls.
He &s;cents them at a di&s;tance; he &s;eizes his opportunity, conceals his
approaches, creeps &s;lyly along, makes the attack, and &s;eldom re|turns
without his booty. If he be able to get into the yard, he begins by levelling
all the poultry without remor&s;e, and carrying off a part of the &s;poil,
hides it at &s;ome convenient di&s;tance, and again returns to the charge.
Taking off another fowl in the &s;ame manner, he hides that al&s;o, but not in
the &s;ame place; and this he practi&s;es for &s;everal times together, until
the approach of day, or the noi&s;e of the dome&s;tics, give him warning to
retire. The &s;ame arts are practi&s;ed when he finds birds en|tangled in
&s;pringes laid for them by the fowler; the fox takes care to be beforehand,
very ex|pertly takes the bird out of the &s;nare, hides it for three or four
days, and knows very ex|actly when and where to return to avail him&s;elf of
hidden trea&s;ure. He is equally alert in &s;eiz|ing the young hares and
rabbits, before they <PB N="327" REF="379"> have &s;trength enough to e&s;cape
him, and when the old ones are wounded and fatigued he is &s;ure to come upon
them in their moments of di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;hew them no mercy. In the
&s;ame manner he finds out birds ne&s;ts, &s;eizes the partridge and the quail
while &s;itting, and de|&s;troys a large quantity of game. The wolf is mo&s;t
hurtful to the pea&s;ant, but the fox to the gentleman. In &s;hort, nothing
that can be eaten &s;eems to come ami&s;s; rats, mice, &s;erpents, toads, and
lizards. He will, when urged by hunger, eat carrots and in&s;ects; and tho&s;e
that live near the &s;ea-coa&s;ts will, for want of other food, eat crabs,
&s;hrimps, and &s;hell fi&s;h. The hedge-hog in vain rolls it&s;elf up into a
ball to oppo&s;e him, this determined glutton teizes it until it is obliged to
appear uncovered, and then he devours it. The wa&s;p and the wild bee are
attacked with equal &s;ucce&s;s. Although at fir&s;t they fly out upon their
invader, and ac|tually oblige him to retire, this is but for a few minutes,
until he has rolled him&s;elf upon the ground, and thus cru&s;hed &s;uch as
&s;tick to his &s;kin; he then returns to the charge, and at la&s;t, by
per&s;everance, obliges them to abandon their combs; which he greedily devours,
both wax and honey.</P>
<P>The chace of the fox requires le&s;s preparation 
<PB N="328" REF="380"> than that of the wolf, and it is al&s;o more plea|&s;ant
and amu&s;ing. As dogs have a natural re|pugnance to pur&s;ue the wolf, &s;o
they are equally alert in following the fox; which chace they prefer even to
that of the hare or the buck. The hunt&s;men, as upon other occa&s;ions, have
their cant terms for every part of this chace. The fox the fir&s;t year is
called <HI>a cub</HI>; the &s;econd, <HI>a fox</HI>; and the third, an <HI>old
fox</HI>; his tail is called the <HI>bru&s;h</HI> or <HI>drag,</HI> and his
excrement the <HI>billiting.</HI> He is u&s;ually pur&s;ued by a large kind of
harrier or hound, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tarriers, or a &s;maller breed, that follow
him into his kennel, and at|tack him there. The in&s;tant he perceives
him|&s;elf pur&s;ued, he makes to his kennel, and takes refuge at the bottom of
it, where for a while he lo&s;es the cry of his enemies; but the whole pack
coming to the mouth, redouble their ve|hemence and rage, and the little tarrier
boldly ventures in. It often happens that the kennel is made under a rock, or
among the roots of old trees; and in &s;uch ca&s;es the fox cannot be dug out,
nor is the tarrier able to contend with him at the bottom of his hole. By this
con|trivance he continues &s;ecure; but when he can be dug out, the u&s;ual way
is to carry him in a bag to &s;ome open country, and there &s;et him loo&s;e
before the hounds. The hounds and the <PB N="329" REF="381"> men follow,
barking and &s;houting wherever he runs; and the body being &s;trongly
employed, the mind has not time to make any re|flection on the futility of the
pur&s;uit. What adds to this entertainment is the &s;trong &s;cent which the
fox leaves, that always keeps up a full cry; although as his &s;cent is
&s;tronger than that of the hare, it is much &s;ooner evaporated. His &s;hifts
to e&s;cape when all retreat is cut off to his kennel are various and
&s;urprizing. He always chu&s;es the mo&s;t woody country, and takes tho&s;e
paths that are mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed with thorns and briars. He does not
double, nor u&s;e the unavailing &s;hifts of the hare; but flies in a direct
line before the hounds, though at no very great di&s;tance; manages his
&s;trength; takes to the low and pla&s;hy grounds, where the &s;cent will be
le&s;s apt to lie; and at la&s;t, when overtaken, he defends him&s;elf with
de&s;perate ob&s;tinacy, and fights in &s;ilence to the very la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>The fox, though re&s;embling the dog in many re&s;pects, is
neverthele&s;s very di&s;tinct in his na|ture, refu&s;ing to engender with it;
and though not te&s;tifying the antipathy of the wolf, yet di&s;covering
nothing more than indifference. This animal al&s;o brings forth fewer at a time
than the dog, and that but once a year. Its <PB N="330" REF="382"> litter is
generally from four to &s;ix, and &s;eldom le&s;s than three. The female goes
with young about &s;ix weeks, and &s;eldom &s;tirs out while pregnant, but
makes a bed for her young, and takes every precaution to prepare for their
pro|duction. When &s;he finds the place of their retreat di&s;covered, and that
her young have been di&s;turbed during her ab&s;ence, &s;he removes them one
after the other in her mouth, and en|deavours to find them out a place of
better &s;e|curity. A remarkable in&s;tance of this animal's parental affection
happened while I was writing this hi&s;tory, in the county of E&s;&s;ex. A
&s;he-fox that had, as it &s;hould &s;eem, but one cub, was unkennelled by a
gentleman's hounds, near Chelmsford, and hotly pur&s;ued. In &s;uch a ca&s;e,
when her own life was in imminent peril, one would think it was not a time to
con&s;ult the &s;afety of her young; however, the poor animal, braving every
danger, rather than leave her cub behind to be worried by the dogs, took it up
in her mouth, and ran with it in this manner for &s;ome miles. At la&s;t,
taking her way through a farmer's yard, &s;he was a&s;&s;aulted by a ma&s;tiff,
and at la&s;t obliged to drop her cub, which was taken up by the farmer. I was
not di&s;plea&s;ed to hear that this faithful creature e&s;caped the pur&s;uit,
and at la&s;t got off in &s;afety. <PB N="331" REF="383"> The cubs of the fox
are born blind, like tho&s;e of the dog; they are eighteen months or two years
in coming to perfection, and live about twelve or fourteen years.</P>
<P>As the fox makes war upon all animals, &s;o all others &s;eem to
make war upon him. The dog hunts him with peculiar acrimony; the wolf is
&s;till a greater and more nece&s;&s;itous enemy, who pur&s;ues him to his very
retreat. Some pretend to &s;ay that, to keep the wolf away, the fox lays at the
mouth of its kennel a certain herb, to which the wolf has a parti|cular
aver&s;ion. This, which no doubt is a fable, at lea&s;t &s;hews that the&s;e
two animals are as much enemies to each other as to all the re&s;t of animated
nature. But the fox is not hunted by quadrupedes alone; for the birds, who know
him for their mortal enemy, attend him in his excur&s;ions, and give each other
warning of their approaching danger. The daw, the magpye, and the black bird
conduct him along, perching on the hedges as he creeps below, and, with their
cries and notes of ho&s;tility, apprize all other animals to beware; a caution
which they per|fectly under&s;tand, and put into practice. The hunters
them&s;elves are often informed by the birds of the place of his retreat, and
&s;et the dogs into tho&s;e thickets where they &s;ee them par|ticularly 
<PB N="332" REF="384"> noi&s;y and querulous. So that it is the fate of this
petty plunderer to be dete&s;ted by every rank of animals; all the weaker
cla&s;&s;es &s;hun, and all the &s;tronger pur&s;ue him.</P>
<P>The fox, of all wild animals, is mo&s;t &s;ubject to the influence
of climate; and there are found as many varieties in this kind almo&s;t as in
any of the dome&s;tic animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon,
Renard.</BIBL></NOTE>. The generality of foxes, as is well known, are red; but
there are &s;ome, though not in England, of a greyi&s;h ca&s;t; and Mr. Buffon
a&s;&s;erts that the tip of the tail in all foxes is white; which, however, is
not &s;o in tho&s;e of this country. There are only three varieties of this
animal in Great Britain, and the&s;e are rather e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a
difference of &s;ize than of colour or form. The grey-hound fox is the
large&s;t, talle&s;t, and bolde&s;t; and will attack a grown &s;heep. The
ma&s;tiff fox is le&s;s, but more &s;trongly built. The cur fox is the lea&s;t
and mo&s;t common; he lurks about hedges and out-hou&s;es, and is the mo&s;t
pernicious of the three to the pea&s;ant and farmer.</P>
<P>In the colder countries round the pole, the foxes are of all

Africa, and in the countries lying under the torrid zone. Tho&s;e travellers
who talk of having &s;een them at Ca|licut, and other parts of Southern India,
have mi&s;taken the jackall for the fox. The fur of the white fox is held in no
great e&s;timation, be|cau&s;e the hair falls off; the blue fox &s;kins are
al&s;o bought up with great avidity, from their &s;carcene&s;s; but the black
fox &s;kin is of all others the mo&s;t e&s;teemed, a &s;ingle &s;kin often
&s;elling for forty or fifty crowns. The hair of the&s;e is &s;o di&s;po&s;ed,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell which way the grain lies; for if we hold the
&s;kin by the head the hair hangs to the tail, and if we hold it by the tail it
hangs down equally &s;mooth and even to the head. The&s;e are often made into
men's muffs, and are at once very beautiful and warm. In our temperate climate,
however, furs are of very little &s;ervice, there being &s;carce any weather
&s;o &s;evere in England from which our ordinary cloaths may not very well
defend us.</P>

<HEAD>THE JACKALL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jackall is one of the commone&s;t wild animals in the whole
ea&s;t; and yet there is &s;carce any le&s;s known in Europe, or more
con|fu&s;edly de&s;cribed by natural hi&s;torians. In ge|neral, we are
a&s;&s;ured that it re&s;embles the fox in figure and di&s;po&s;ition, but we
are &s;till ig|norant of tho&s;e nice di&s;tinctions by which it is known to be
of a different &s;pecies. It is &s;aid to be of the &s;ize of a middling dog,
re&s;embling the fox in the hinder parts, particularly the tail; and the wolf
in the fore-parts, e&s;pecially the no&s;e. Its legs are &s;horter than tho&s;e
of the fox, and its colour is of a bright yellow, or &s;orrel, as we expre&s;s
it in hor&s;es. This is the rea&s;on it has been called in Latin the Golden
Wolf; a name, however, which is entirely unknown in the countries where they
are mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the jackall is diffu&s;ed all over A&s;ia, and is
found al&s;o in mo&s;t parts of Africa, &s;eeming to take up the place of the
wolf, which in tho&s;e countries is not &s;o common. There &s;eems to be many
varieties among them; tho&s;e of the warme&s;t climates appear to be the
large&s;t, and their colour is rather of a reddi&s;h brown than of that
beautiful yellow by which the &s;maller jackall are chiefly
di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="390">Although the &s;pecies of the wolf
approaches very near to that of the dog, yet the jackall &s;eems to be placed
between them; to the &s;avage fiercene&s;s of the wolf it adds the impudent
fa|miliarity of the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon vol. xxvii. p.
52.</BIBL></NOTE>. Its cry is an howl, mixed with barking, and a lamentation
re&s;embling that of human di&s;tre&s;s. It is more noi&s;y in its pur|&s;uits
even than the dog, and more voracious than the wolf. The jackall never goes
alone, but always in a pack of forty or fifty together. The&s;e unite regularly
every day to form a com|bination again&s;t the re&s;t of the fore&s;t. Nothing
then can e&s;cape them; they are content to take up with the &s;malle&s;t
animals; and yet, when thus united, have they courage to face the large&s;t.
They &s;eem very little afraid of mankind; but pur&s;ue their game to their
very doors, without te&s;tify|ing either attachment or apprehen&s;ion. They
enter in&s;olently into the &s;heep-folds, the yards, and the &s;tables, and,
when they can find nothing el&s;e, devour the leather harne&s;s, boots, and
&s;hoes, and run off with what they have not time to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>They not only attack the living but the dead. They &s;cratch up
with their feet the new made graves, and devour the corp&s;e how putrid
&s;oever. <PB N="336" REF="391"> In tho&s;e countries therefore where they
abound, they are obliged to beat the earth over the grave, and to mix it with
thorns, to prevent the jackalls from &s;craping it away. They always
a&s;&s;i&s;t each other as well in this employment of exhumation as in that of
the chace. While they are at this dreary work, they exhort each other by a
mo&s;t mournful cry, re&s;embling that of children under cha&s;ti&s;ement; and
when they have thus dug up the body, they &s;hare it ami|cably between them.
The&s;e, like all other &s;a|vage animals, when they have once ta&s;ted of
human fle&s;h, can never after refrain from pur|&s;uing mankind. They watch the
burying grounds, follow armies, and keep in the rear of caravans. They may be
con&s;idered as the vulture of the quadrupede kind; every thing that once had
animal life, &s;eems equally agree|able to them; the mo&s;t putrid
&s;ub&s;tances are greedily devoured; dried leather, and any thing that has
been rubbed with grea&s;e, how in&s;ipid &s;oever in it&s;elf, is &s;ufficient
to make the whole go down.</P>
<P>They hide them&s;elves in holes by day, and &s;eldom appear abroad
till night-fall, when the jackall that has fir&s;t hit upon the &s;cent of
&s;ome larger bea&s;t gives notice to the re&s;t by an howl, 
<PB N="337" REF="392"> which it repeats as it runs; while all the re&s;t, that
are within hearing, pack in to its a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The gazelle, or whatever
other bea&s;t it may be, finding it&s;elf pur&s;ued, makes off towards the
hou&s;es and the towns; hoping, by that means, to deter its pur&s;uers from
follow|ing: but hunger gives the jackall the &s;ame de|gree of boldne&s;s that
&s;car gives the gazelle, and it pur&s;ues even to the verge of the city, and
often along the &s;treets. The gazelle, however, by this means, mo&s;t
frequently e&s;capes; for the inhabitants &s;allying our, often di&s;turb the
jack|all in the chace; and as it hunts by the &s;cent, when once driven off, it
never recovers it again. In this manner we &s;ee how experience prompts the
gazelle, which is naturally a very timid animal, and particularly fearful of
man him&s;elf, to take refuge near him, con&s;idering him as the lea&s;t
dangerous enemy, and often e&s;caping by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But man is not the only intruder upon the jackall's indu&s;try and
pur&s;uits. The lion, the tiger, and the panther, who&s;e appetites are
&s;u|perior to their &s;wiftne&s;s, attend to its call, and follow in &s;ilence
at &s;ome di&s;tance behind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;tema, p.
60.</BIBL></NOTE>. The jackall pur&s;ues the whole night with un|cea&s;ing
a&s;&s;iduity, keeping up the cry, and with <PB N="338" REF="393"> great
per&s;everance at la&s;t tires down its prey; but ju&s;t at the moment it
&s;uppo&s;es it&s;elf going to &s;hare the fruits of its labour, the lion or
the leopard comes in, &s;atiates him&s;elf upon the &s;poil, and his poor
provider mu&s;t be content with the bare carca&s;s he leaves behind. It is not
to be wondered at, therefore, if the jackall be voracious, &s;ince it &s;o
&s;eldom has a &s;uffi|ciency; nor that it feeds on putrid &s;ub&s;tances,
&s;ince it is not permitted to fea&s;t on what it has newly killed. Be&s;ide
the&s;e enemies, the jackall has &s;till another to cope with, for between him
and the dog there is an irreconcileable anti|pathy, and they never part without
an engage|ment. The Indian pea&s;ants often chace them as we do foxes; and have
learned, by expe|rience, when they have got a lion or a tiger in their rear.
Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions they keep their dogs clo&s;e, as they would be no match
for &s;uch formidable animals, and endeavour to put them to flight with their
cries. When the lion is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, they more ea&s;ily cope with the
jackall, who is as &s;tupid as it is impudent, and &s;eems much better fitted
for pur&s;uing than re|treating. It &s;ometimes happens that one of them
&s;teals &s;ilently into an outhou&s;e, to &s;eize the poultry, or devour the
furniture, but hear|ing others in full cry without at a di&s;tance, 
<PB N="339" REF="394"> without thought, it in&s;tantly an&s;wers the call, and
thus betrays its own depredations. The pea&s;ants &s;ally out upon it, and the
fooli&s;h ani|mal finds, too late, that its in&s;tinct was too powerful for its
&s;afety.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ISATIS.</HEAD>
<P>AS the jackall is a &s;ort of intermediate &s;pe|cies between the
dog and the wolf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this de&s;cription I have followed
Mr. Buffon.</NOTE>, &s;o the i&s;atis may be con&s;idered as placed between the
dog and the fox. This animal has hitherto been &s;uppo&s;ed to be only a
variety of the latter; but from the late&s;t ob&s;ervations, there is no doubt
of their being perfectly di&s;tinct. The i&s;atis is very common in all the
northern countries bor|dering upon the Icy &s;ea; and is &s;eldom found, except
in the colde&s;t countries. It extremely re&s;embles a fox, in the form of its
body, and the length of its tail; and a dog, in the make of its head, and the
po&s;ition of its eyes. The hair of the&s;e animals is &s;ofter than that of a
common fox; &s;ome are blue, &s;ome are white at one &s;ea&s;on, and at another
of a ru&s;&s;et brown. Although the whole of its hair be two inches long,
thick, tufted and glo&s;&s;y, yet the under <PB N="340" REF="395"> jaw is
entirely without any, and the &s;kin appears bare in that part.</P>
<P>This animal can bear only the colde&s;t climates, and is chiefly
&s;een along the coa&s;ts of the Icy &s;ea, and upon the banks of the great
rivers that di&s;charge them&s;elves therein. It is chiefly fond of living in
the open country, and &s;eldom &s;een in the fore&s;t, being mo&s;tly found in
the moun|tainous and naked regions of Norway, Siberia, and Lapland. It burrows,
like the fox; and when with young, the female retires to her kennel, in the
&s;ame manner as the fox is &s;een to do. The&s;e holes, which are very narrow,
and extremely deep, have many out-lets. They are kept very clean, and are
bedded at the bottom with mo&s;s, for the animal to be more at its ea&s;e. Its
manner of coupling, time of ge&s;tation, and number of young, are all &s;imilar
to what is found in the fox; and it u&s;ually brings forth at the end of May,
or the beginning of June.</P>
<P>Such are the particulars in which this animal differs from tho&s;e
of the dog kind, and in which it re&s;embles them: but its mo&s;t &s;triking
peculiarity remains &s;till to be mentioned; namely, its changing its colour,
and being &s;een at one time brown, and at another perfectly white. As was
already &s;aid, &s;ome are natu|rally blue, and their colour never changes; but
<PB N="341" REF="396"> &s;uch as are to be white, are, when brought forth, of a
yellow hue, which, in the beginning of September, is changed to white, all
except along the top of the back, along which runs a &s;tripe of brown, and
another cro&s;&s;ing it down the &s;houlders, at which time the animal is
called the <HI>cro&s;t fox</HI>; however, this brown cro&s;s totally
di&s;appears before winter, and then the creature is all over white, and its
fur is two inches long: this, about the beginning of May, again begins to fall;
and the molting is completed about the middle of July, when the i&s;atis
becomes brown once more. The fur of this animal is of no value, unle&s;s it be
killed in winter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE HYAENA.</HEAD>
<P>THE hyaena is the la&s;t animal I &s;hall men|tion among tho&s;e
of the dog kind, which it in many re&s;pects re&s;embles, although too
&s;trongly marked to be &s;trictly reduced to any type. The hyaena is nearly of
the &s;ize of a wolf; and has &s;ome &s;imilitude to that animal in the &s;hape
of its head and body. The head, at fir&s;t &s;ight, does not appear to differ,
except that the ears of the hyaena are longer, and more without hair; but, upon
ob&s;erving more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall find the head broader, the no&s;e
&s;latter, and <PB N="342" REF="397"> not &s;o pointed. The eyes are not placed
ob|liquely, but more like tho&s;e of a dog. The legs, particularly the hinder,
are longer than tho&s;e either of the dog or the wolf, and differ|ent from all
other quadrupedes what&s;oever, in having but four toes, as well on the fore
feet as on the hinder. Its hair is of a dirty greyi&s;h, marked with black,
di&s;po&s;ed in waves down its body. Its tail is &s;hort, with pretty long
hair; and immediately under it, above the anus, there is an opening into a kind
of glandular pouch, which &s;eparates a &s;ub&s;tance of the con|&s;i&s;tence,
but not of the odour, of civet. This opening might have given ri&s;e to the
error of the ancients, who a&s;&s;erted, that this animal was every year,
alternately, male and female. Such are the mo&s;t &s;triking di&s;tinctions of
the hyaena, as given us by naturali&s;ts; which, ne|verthele&s;s, convey but a
very confu&s;ed idea of the peculiarity of its form. Its manner of hold|ing the
head &s;eems remarkable; &s;omewhat like a dog, pur&s;uing the &s;cent, with
the no&s;e near the ground. The head being held thus low, the back appears
elevated, like that of the hog, which, with a long bri&s;tly band of hair that
runs all along, gives it a good deal the air of that animal; and, it is
probable that, from this &s;imilitude it fir&s;t took its name, the word
<HI>huoina</HI> <PB N="343" REF="398"> being Greek, and derived from
<HI>hus,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies a &s;ow.</P>
<P>But no words can give an adequate idea of this animal's figure,
deformity, and fiercene&s;s, more &s;avage and untameable than any other
quadrupede, it &s;eems to be for ever in a &s;tate of rage or rapacity, for
ever growling, except when receiving its food. Its eyes then gli&s;ten, the
bri&s;tles of its back all &s;tand upright, its head hangs low, and yet its
teeth appear; all which give it a mo&s;t frightful a&s;pect, which a dreadful
howl tends to heighten. This, which I have often heard, is very peculiar: its
be|ginning re&s;embles the voice of a man moan|ing, and its latter part as if
he were making a violent effort to vomit. As it is loud and fre|quent, it
might, perhaps, have been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for that of a human voice in
di&s;tre&s;s, and have given ri&s;e to the accounts of the ancients, who tell
us, that the hyaena makes its moan, to attract unwary travellers, and then to
de&s;troy them: however this be, it &s;eems the mo&s;t un|tractable, and, for
its &s;ize, the mo&s;t terrible of all other quadrupedes; nor does its courage
fall &s;hort of its ferocity; it defends it&s;elf again&s;t the lion, is a
match for the panther, and attacks the ounce, that it &s;eldom fails to
conquer.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;cene and &s;olitary animal, to be 
<PB N="344" REF="399"> found chiefly in the mo&s;t de&s;olate and unculti|vated
parts of the torrid zone, of which it is a native<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. It re&s;ides in the caverns of
mountains, in the clefts of rocks, or in dens that it has formed for it&s;elf
under the earth. Though taken never &s;o young, it cannot be tamed; it lives by
depredation, like the wolf, but is much &s;tronger, and more courageous. It
&s;ometimes attacks man, carries off cattle, follows the flock, breaks open the
&s;heep cots by night, and ravages with in&s;atiable voracity. Its eyes &s;hine
by night; and it is a&s;&s;erted, not without great appearance of truth, that
it &s;ees better by night than by day. When de&s;titute of other provi&s;ion,
it &s;crapes up the graves, and devours the dead bodies, how putrid &s;o ever.
To the&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions, which are &s;ufficiently noxious and for|midable,
the ancients have added numberle&s;s others, which are long &s;ince known to be
fables; as, for in&s;tance, that the hyaena was male and female alternately;
that having brought forth and &s;uckled its young, it then changed &s;exes for
a year, and became a male. This, as was mentioned above, could only proceed
from the opening under the tail, which all animals of this &s;pecies are found
to have; and which is found in the &s;ame manner in no other quadrupede,

&s;lenderne&s;s of their bodies, which are &s;o fitted as to wind, like worms,
into very &s;mall openings, after their prey; and hence al&s;o they have
received the name of vermin, from their &s;imilitude to the worm in this
particular. The&s;e animals differ from all of the cat kind, in the formation
and di&s;po&s;ition of their claws, which, as in the dog kinds, they can
neither draw in nor extend at plea&s;ure, as cats are known to do. They differ
from the dog kind, in being cloathed rather with fur than hair; and although
&s;ome varieties of the fox may re&s;emble them in this particular, yet the
coat of the latter is longer, &s;tronger, and always more re&s;embling hair.
Be&s;ide the&s;e di&s;tinctions, all animals of the <PB N="347" REF="405">
wea&s;el kind have glands placed near the anus, that either open into it, or
beneath it, furni&s;h|ing a &s;ub&s;tance that, in &s;ome, has the mo&s;t
offen&s;ive &s;mell in nature, in others, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing perfume. All of
this kind are &s;till more marked by their habitudes and di&s;po|&s;itions,
than their external form; cruel, vora|cious, and cowardly, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t
only by theft, and find their chief protection in their minute|ne&s;s. They are
all, from the &s;hortne&s;s of their legs, &s;low in pur&s;uit; and, therefore,
owe their &s;upport to their patience, a&s;&s;iduity, and cun|ning. As their
prey is precarious, they live a long time without food; and if they happen to
fall in where it is in plenty, they in&s;tantly de&s;troy all about them before
they begin to &s;atisfy their appetite, and &s;uck the blood of every animal
before they begin to touch its fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the marks common to this kind, all the &s;pecies of
which have a mo&s;t &s;triking re&s;emblance to each other; and he that has
&s;een one, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, may be &s;aid to have &s;een all. The chief
di&s;tinction in this nu|merous cla&s;s of animals, is to be taken from the
&s;ize; for no words can give the minute ir|regularities of that outline by
which one &s;pecies is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that which is next 
<PB N="348" REF="406"> it. I will begin, therefore, with the lea&s;t and the
be&s;t known of this kind, and &s;till marking the &s;ize, will proceed
gradually to larger and larger, until we come from the wea&s;el to the glutton,
which I take to be the large&s;t of all. The wea&s;el will &s;erve as a model
for all the re&s;t; and, indeed, the points in which they differ from this
little animal, are but very in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Wea&s;el<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol.
i. p. 83.</BIBL></NOTE>, as was &s;aid, is the &s;malle&s;t of this numerous
tribe; its length not exceeding &s;even inches, from the tip of the no&s;e to
the in&s;ertion of the tail. This length, however, &s;eems to be very great, if
we compare it with the height of the animal, which is not above an inch and an
half. In mea&s;uring the wolf, we find him to be not above once and an half as
long as he is high; in ob&s;erving the wea&s;el, we find it near five times as
long as it is high, which &s;hews an amazing di&s;proportion. The tail al&s;o,
which is bu&s;hy, is two inches and an half long, and adds to the apparent
length of this little animal's body. The colour of the wea&s;el is of a bright
red on the back and &s;ides, but white under the throat and the belly. It has
whi&s;kers like a cat; and thirty two teeth, which is two more than any of the
cat kind; and the&s;e <PB N="349" REF="407"> al&s;o &s;eem better adapted for
tearing and chew|ing, than tho&s;e of the cat kind are. The eyes are little and
black. The ears &s;hort, broad, and roundi&s;h; and have a fold at the lower
part, which makes them look as if they were double. Beneath the corners of the
mouth, on each jaw, is a &s;pot of brown.</P>
<P>This animal, though very diminutive to appearance, is,
neverthele&s;s, a very formidable enemy to quadrupedes an hundred times its own
&s;ize. It is very common and well known in mo&s;t parts of this country; but
&s;eems held in very different e&s;timation, in different parts of it. In
tho&s;e places where &s;heep or lambs are bred, the wea&s;el is a mo&s;t
noxious inmate, and every art is u&s;ed to de&s;troy it; on the con|trary, in
places where agriculture is chiefly fol|lowed, the wea&s;el is con&s;idered as
a friend that thins the number of &s;uch vermin as chiefly live upon corn:
however, in all places, it is one of the mo&s;t untameable and untractable
animals in the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xv. p.
37.</BIBL></NOTE>. When kept in a cage, either for the purpo&s;es of
amu&s;ement or in&s;pection, it will not touch any part of its victuals while
any body looks on. It keeps in a continual agitation, and &s;eems frighted &s;o
much at the &s;ight of mankind, that it will die, if not permitted to hide
it&s;elf from <PB N="350" REF="408"> their pre&s;ence. For this purpo&s;e, it
mu&s;t be provided, in its cage, with a &s;ufficient quantity of wool or hay,
in which it may conceal it&s;elf, and where it may carry whatever it has got to
eat; which, however, it will not touch until it begins to putrefy. In this
&s;tate it is &s;een to pa&s;s three parts of the day in &s;leeping; and
re|&s;erves the night for its times of exerci&s;e and eating.</P>
<P>In its wild &s;tate, the night is likewi&s;e the time during which
it may be properly &s;aid to live. At the approach of evening, it is &s;een
&s;tealing from its hole, and creeping about the farmer's yard for its prey. If
it enters the place where poultry are kept, it never attacks the cocks or the
old hens, but immediately aims at the young ones. It does not eat its prey on
the place, but, after killing it by a &s;ingle bite near the head, and with a
wound &s;o &s;mall that the place can &s;carcely be perceived, it carries it
off to its young, or its retreat. It al&s;o breaks and &s;ucks the eggs, and
&s;ometimes kills the hen that attempts to defend them. It is remark|ably
active; and, in a confined place, &s;carce any animal can e&s;cape it. It will
run up the &s;ides of walls with &s;uch facility, that no place is &s;e|cure
from it; and its body is &s;o &s;mall, that there is &s;carce any hole but what
it can wind <PB N="351" REF="409"> through. During the &s;ummer, its
excur&s;ions are more exten&s;ive; but in winter, it chiefly confines it&s;elf
in barns and farm-yards, where it remains till &s;pring, and where it brings
forth its young. All this &s;ea&s;on it makes war upon the rats and mice, with
&s;till greater &s;ucce&s;s than the cat; for being more active and &s;lender,
it pur&s;ues them into their holes, and, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance,
de&s;troys them. It creeps al&s;o into pidgeon-holes, de&s;troys the young,
catches &s;parrows, and all kind of &s;mall birds; and, if it has brought forth
its young, hunts with &s;till greater boldne&s;s and avidity. In &s;ummer, it
ventures farther from the hou&s;e; and par|ticularly goes into tho&s;e places
where the rat, its chiefe&s;t prey, goes before it. Accordingly, it is found in
the lower grounds, by the &s;ide of waters, near mills, and often is &s;een to
hide its young in the hollow of a tree.</P>
<P>The female takes every precaution to make an ea&s;y bed for her
little ones: &s;he lines the bottom of her hole with gra&s;s, hay, leaves, and
mo&s;s, and generally brings forth from three to five at a time. All animals of
this, as well as tho&s;e of the dog kind, bring forth their young with clo&s;ed
eyes; but they very &s;oon acquire &s;trength &s;ufficient to follow the dam in
her ex|cur&s;ions, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in her projects of petty 
<PB N="352" REF="410"> rapine. The wea&s;el, like all others of its kind, does
not run on equably, but moves by bound|ing; and when it climbs a tree, by a
&s;ingle &s;pring it gets a good way from the ground. It jumps in the &s;ame
manner upon its prey; and, having an extremely limber body, evades the attempts
of much &s;tronger animals to &s;eize it.</P>
<P>This animal, like all of its kind, has a very &s;trong &s;mell; and
that of the wea&s;el is peculiarly foetid. This &s;cent is very
di&s;tingui&s;hable in tho&s;e creatures, when they void their excre|ment; for
the glands which furni&s;h this foetid &s;ub&s;tance, which is of the
con&s;i&s;tence of &s;uet, open directly into the orifice of the anus, and
taint the excrement with the &s;trong effluvia. The wea&s;el &s;mells more
&s;trongly in &s;ummer than in winter; and more abominably when ir|ritated or
pur&s;ued, than when at its ea&s;e. It always preys in &s;ilence, and never has
a cry ex|cept when &s;truck, and then it has a rough kind of &s;queaking, which
at once expre&s;&s;es re&s;ent|ment and pain. Its appetite for animal food
never for&s;akes it; and it &s;eems even to take a plea&s;ure in the vicinity
of putrefaction. Mr. Buffon tells us of one of them being found, with three
young ones, in the carca&s;s of a wolf that was grown putrid, and that had been
hung up, by the hind legs, as a terror to others. <PB N="353" REF="411"> Into
this horrid retreat the wea&s;el thought proper to retire to bring forth her
young; &s;he had furni&s;hed the cavity with hay, gra&s;s, and leaves; and the
young were ju&s;t brought forth when they were di&s;covered by a pea&s;ant
pa&s;&s;ing that way.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE ERMINE, OR STOAT,</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the wea&s;el in &s;ize, and perfectly alike in figure, is
the Ermine. The difference between this and the former animal is &s;o very
&s;mall, that many, and among the re&s;t Linnaeus, who gives but one
de&s;cription of both, have confounded the two kinds together. However their
differences are &s;ufficient to induce later naturali&s;ts to &s;uppo&s;e the
two kinds di&s;tinct; and as their lights &s;eems preferable, we chu&s;e to
follow their de&s;criptions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, Briti&s;h
Zoology.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;toat, or ermine, differs from the wea&s;el in &s;ize, being
u&s;ually nine inches long; whereas the former is not much above &s;ix. The
tail of the ermine is always tipped with black, and is longer in proportion to
the body and more fur|ni&s;hed with hair. The edges of the ears and the ends of
the toes in this animal are of a yellowi&s;h white; and although it is of the
&s;ame colour with the wea&s;el, being of a lighti&s;h <PB N="354" REF="412">
brown, and though both this animal, as well as the wea&s;el, in the mo&s;t
northern parts of Europe, changes its colour in winter, and be|comes white; yet
even then the wea&s;el may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ermine by the
tip of the tail, which in the latter is always black.</P>
<P>It is well known that the fur of the ermine is the mo&s;t valuable
of any hitherto known; and it is in winter only that this little animal has it
of the proper colour and con&s;i&s;tence. In &s;ummer, the ermine, as was
&s;aid before, is brown, and it may at that time more properly be called the
&s;toat. There are few &s;o unac|quainted with quadrupedes as not to perceive
this change of colour in the hair, which in &s;ome degree obtains in them all.
The hor&s;e, the cow, and the goat, all manife&s;tly change colour in the
beginning of &s;ummer, the old long hair falling off, and a &s;horter coat of
hair appearing in its room, generally of a darker colour, and yet more
glo&s;&s;y. What obtains in our temperate climate, is &s;een to prevail &s;till
more &s;trongly in tho&s;e regions where the winters are long and &s;evere, and
the &s;ummers &s;hort and yet generally hot in an extreme degree. The animal
has &s;trength enough during that &s;ea&s;on, to throw off a warm coat of fur,
which would but incommode it, and continues for two or <PB N="355" REF="413">
three months in a &s;tate &s;omewhat re&s;embling the ordinary quadrupedes of
the milder cli|mates. At the approach of winter, however, the cold
encrea&s;ing, the coat of hair &s;eems to thicken in proportion; from being
coar&s;e and &s;hort it lengthens and grows finer, while mul|titudes of
&s;maller hairs grow up between the longer, thicken the coat, and give it all
that warmth and &s;oftne&s;s which are &s;o much valued in the furs of the
northern animals.</P>
<P>It is no ea&s;y matter to account for this re|markable warmth of
the furs of northern qua|drupedes, or how they come to be furni&s;hed with
&s;uch an abundant covering. It is ea&s;y enough, indeed, to &s;ay that Nature
fits them thus for the climate; and, like an indulgent mother, when &s;he
expo&s;es them to the rigour of an intem|perate winter, &s;upplies them with a
covering again&s;t its inclemency. But this is only flou|ri&s;hing; it is not
ea&s;y, I &s;ay, to tell how Nature comes to furni&s;h them in this manner. A
few particulars on this &s;ubject are all that we yet know. It is ob&s;ervable
among quadrupedes, as well as even among the human &s;pecies it&s;elf, that a
thin &s;paring diet is apt to produce hair; children that have been ill fed,
fami&s;hed dogs and hor&s;es, are more hairy than others who&s;e food has been
more plentiful. This may, therefore, be one <PB N="356" REF="414"> cau&s;e that
the animals of the north, in winter, are more hairy than tho&s;e of the milder
climates. At that &s;ea&s;on, the whole country is covered with deep &s;now,
and the provi&s;ions which the&s;e creatures are able to procure can be but
pre|carious and &s;canty. Its becoming finer may al&s;o proceed from the
&s;everity of the cold, that contracts the pores of the &s;kin, and the hair
con&s;equently takes the &s;hape of the aperture through which it grows, as
wiers are made &s;maller by being drawn through a &s;maller ori|fice. However
this may be, all the animals of the artic climates may be &s;aid to have their
winter and &s;ummer garments, except very far to the north, as in Greenland,
where the cold is &s;o continually inten&s;e and the food &s;o &s;carce, that
neither the bears nor foxes change colour at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Krantz's Hi&s;tory of Greenland, vol. i. p.
72.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ermine, as was &s;aid, is remarkable among the&s;e for the
&s;oftne&s;s, the clo&s;ene&s;s, and the warmth of its fur. It is brown in
&s;ummer, like the wea&s;el, and changes colour before the winter is begun,
becoming a beautiful cream colour, all except the tip of the tail, as was
&s;aid before, which &s;till continues black. Mr. Daubenton had one of the&s;e
brought him with its white winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, which he put into a cage and kept, <PB N="357" REF="415"> in
order to ob&s;erve the manner of moulting its hair. He received it in the
beginning of March, and in a very &s;hort time it began to &s;hed its coat, and
a mixture of brown was &s;een to prevail among the white, &s;o that at the
ninth of the &s;ame month its head was nearly become of a reddi&s;h brown. Day
after day this colour appeared to extend at fir&s;t along the neck and down the
back, in the manner of a &s;tripe of about half an inch broad. The fore-part of
the legs then a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame colour; a part of the head, the thighs,
and the tail, were the la&s;t that changed; but at the end of the month there
was no white remaining, except on tho&s;e parts which are always white in this
&s;pecies, particu|larly the throat and the belly. However, he had not the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing this animal re|&s;ume its former whitene&s;s, although
he kept it for above two years; which, without doubt, was owing to its
impri&s;oned &s;tate; this colour being partly owing to its &s;tinted food, and
partly to the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on. During its &s;tate of confinement, this
little animal always continued very wild and untractable; for ever in a &s;tate
of violent agitation, except when a&s;leep, which it often continued for three
parts of the day. Except for its mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;cent, it was an
extremely pretty creature, its <PB N="358" REF="416"> eyes &s;prightly, its
phy&s;iognomy plea&s;ant, and its motions &s;o &s;wift that the eye could
&s;carce at|tend them. It was fed with eggs and fle&s;h, but it always let them
putrify before it touched either. As &s;ome of this kind are known to be fond
of honey, it was tried to feed this animal with &s;uch food for a while; after
having for three or four days deprived it of other food, it ate of this, and
died &s;hortly after; a &s;trong proof of its being a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from
the pole cat or the martin, who feed upon honey, but otherwi&s;e pretty much
re&s;emble the ermine in their figure and di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>In the north of Europe and Siberia, their &s;kins make a valuable
article of commerce, and they are found there much more frequently than among
us. In Siberia they burrow in the fields, and are taken in traps baited with
fle&s;h. In Norway they are either &s;hot with blunt ar|rows or taken in traps
made of two flat &s;tones, one being propped with a &s;tick, to which is
fa&s;tened a baited &s;tring, which when the ani|mals attempt to pull away, the
&s;tone drops and cru&s;hes them to death. This animal is &s;ome|times found
white in Great Britain, and is then called a white wea&s;el. Its furs, however,
among us are of no value, having neither the thickne&s;s, the clo&s;ene&s;s,
nor the whitene&s;s of tho&s;e which <PB N="359" REF="417"> come from Siberia.
The fur of the ermine, in every country, changes by time; for, as much of its
beautiful whitene&s;s is given it by certain arts known to the furriers, &s;o
its natural colour returns, and its former whitene&s;s can never be re&s;tored
again.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE FERRET.</HEAD>
<P>THE animal next in &s;ize to the ermine, is the ferret; which is a
kind of dome&s;tic in Europe, though &s;aid to be originally brought from
Africa into Spain, which being a country abounding in rabbits, required an
animal of this kind, more than any other: however this be, it is not to be
found at pre&s;ent among us except in its dome&s;tic &s;tate; and it is chiefly
kept tame, for the purpo&s;es of the warren.</P>
<P>The ferret is about one foot long, being nearly four inches longer
than the wea&s;el. It re&s;embles that animal in the &s;lenderne&s;s of its
body, and the &s;hortne&s;s of its legs; but its no&s;e is &s;harper, and its
body more &s;lender, in pro|portion to its length. The ferret is commonly of a
cream colour; but they are al&s;o found of all the colours of the wea&s;el
kind; white, black|i&s;h, brown, and party-coloured. Tho&s;e that are of the
whiti&s;h kind, have their eyes red, as is almo&s;t general with all animals
entirely of that <PB N="360" REF="418"> colour. But its principal di&s;tinction
from the wea&s;el, is the length of the hair on its tail, which is much longer
in the ferret than the wea&s;el. Words will not well expre&s;s the other
di&s;tinctions; and what might take up a page in dull di&s;crimination, a
&s;ingle glance of the eye, when the animals them&s;elves are pre|&s;ented, can
di&s;cover.</P>
<P>As this animal is a native of the torrid zone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, &s;o it cannot bear the rigours of
our climate, without care and &s;helter; and it gene|rally repays the trouble
of its keeping, by its great agility in the warren. It is naturally &s;uch an
enemy of the rabbit kind, that if a dead rabbit be pre&s;ented to a young
ferret, although it has never &s;een one before, it in&s;tantly attacks and
bites it with an appearance of rapacity. If the rabbit be living, the ferret is
&s;till more eager, &s;eizes it by the neck, winds it&s;elf round it, and
continues to &s;uck its blood, till it be &s;atiated.</P>
<P>Their chief u&s;e in warrens, is to enter the holes, and drive the
rabbits into the nets that are prepared for them at the mouth. For this
purpo&s;e, the ferret is muzzled; otherwi&s;e, in|&s;tead of driving out the
rabbit, it would con|tent it&s;elf with killing and &s;ucking its blood at 
<PB N="361" REF="419"> the bottom of the hole; but, by this con|trivance, being
rendered unable to &s;eize its prey, the rabbit e&s;capes from its claws, and
in&s;tantly makes to the mouth of the hole with &s;uch precipitation, that it
is inextricably en|tangled in the net placed there for its reception. It often
happens, however, that the ferret di&s;|engages it&s;elf of its muzzle, and
then it is mo&s;t commonly lo&s;t, unle&s;s it be dug out; for, find|ing all
its wants &s;atisfied in the warren, it never thinks of returning to the owner,
but continues to lead a rapacious &s;olitary life while the &s;ummer continues,
and dies with the cold of the winter. In order to bring the ferret from his
hole, the owners often burn &s;traw and other &s;ub&s;tances at the mouth; they
al&s;o beat above, to terrify it; but this does not always &s;ucceed; for as
there are often &s;everal i&s;&s;ues to each hole, the ferret is affected
neither by the noi&s;e or the &s;moke, but continues &s;ecure at the bottom,
&s;leeping the greate&s;t part of the time, and waking only to &s;atisfy the
calls of hunger.</P>
<P>The female of this &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, is &s;en&s;ibly le&s;s than the male,
whom &s;he &s;eeks with great ar|dour, and, it is &s;aid, often dies, without
being admitted. They are u&s;ually kept in boxes, <PB N="362" REF="420"> with
wool, of which they make them&s;elves a warm bed, which &s;erves to defend them
from the rigour of the climate. They &s;leep almo&s;t continually; and the
in&s;tant they awake, they &s;eem eager for food. They are u&s;ually fed with
bread and milk, and they breed twice a year. Some of them devour their young as
&s;oon as brought forth; and then they become fit for the male again. Their
number is u&s;ually from five to &s;ix at a litter; and this is &s;aid to
con&s;i&s;t of more females than males. Upon the whole, this is an u&s;eful,
but a di&s;agreeable and offen&s;ive animal; its &s;cent is foetid, its nature
voracious, it is tame without any attachment, and &s;uch is its appetite for
blood, that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cradle. It is
very ea&s;y to be irritated; and, although at all times its &s;mell is very
offen&s;ive, it then is much more &s;o; and its bite is very difficult of
cure.</P>
<P>To the ferret kind we may add an animal which Mr. Buffon calls the
Van&s;ire, the &s;kin of which was &s;ent him &s;tuffed, from Madaga&s;car. It
was thirteen inches long, a good deal re|&s;embling the ferret in figure, but
differing in the number of its grinding teeth, which amounted to twelve;
whereas, in the ferret, there are but eight: it differed al&s;o in colour, 
<PB N="363" REF="421"> being of a dark brown, and exactly the &s;ame on all
parts of its body. Of this animal, &s;o nearly re&s;embling the ferret, we have
no other hi&s;tory but the mere de&s;cription of its figure; and in a
quadrupede who&s;e kind is &s;o &s;trongly marked, perhaps this is &s;ufficient
to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE POLECAT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Polecat is larger than the wea&s;el, the ermine, or the
ferret, being one foot five inches long; whereas, the wea&s;el is but &s;ix
inches, the ermine nine, and the ferret eleven inches. It &s;o much re&s;embles
the ferret in form, that &s;ome have been of opinion they were one and the
&s;ame animal; neverthele&s;s, there are a &s;ufficient number of
di&s;tinctions between them: it is, in the fir&s;t place, larger than the
ferret; it is not quite &s;o &s;lender, and has a blunter no&s;e; it differs
al&s;o internally, having but fourteen ribs, whereas the ferret has fifteen;
and wants one of the brea&s;t bones, which is found in the ferret: however,
warreners a&s;&s;ert, that the pole|cat will mix with the ferret; and they are

to improve the breed of the latter, which, by long confinement, is &s;ometimes 
<PB N="364" REF="422"> &s;een to abate of its rapacious di&s;po&s;ition. Mr.
Buffon denies that the ferret will admit the pole|cat; yet gives a variety,
under the name of both animals, which may very probably be a &s;purious race
between the two.</P>
<P>However this be, the polecat &s;eems by much the more plea&s;ing
animal of the two; for al|though the long &s;lender &s;hape of all the&s;e
ver|min tribes gives them a very di&s;agreeable ap|pearance, yet the
&s;oftne&s;s and colour of the hair in &s;ome of them, atones for the defect,
and renders them, if not pretty, at lea&s;t not frightful. The polecat, for the
mo&s;t part, is of a deep chocolate colour; it is white about the mouth; the
ears are &s;hort, rounded, and tipt with white; a little beyond the corners of
the mouth a &s;tripe begins, which runs backward, partly white and partly
yellow: its hair, like that of all this cla&s;s, is of two &s;orts; the long
and the furry: but, in this animal, the two kinds are of different colours; the
longe&s;t is black, and the &s;horter yellowi&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ray's Synop&s;is.</BIBL></NOTE>: the throat, feet and tail,
are blacker than any other parts of the body: the claws are white underneath,
and brown above; and its tail is about two inches and an half.</P>
<P>It is very de&s;tructive to young game of all 
<PB N="365" REF="423"> kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology,
vol. i. p. 78.</BIBL></NOTE>: but the rabbit &s;eems to be its fa|vourite prey;
a &s;ingle polecat is often &s;uf|ficient to de&s;troy a whole warren; for,
with that in&s;atiable thir&s;t for blood which is natural to all the wea&s;el
kind, it kills much more than it can devour; and I have &s;een twenty rabbits
at a time taken out dead, which they had de&s;troyed, and that by a wound which
was hardly perceptible. Their &s;ize, however, which is &s;o much larger than
the wea&s;el, renders their retreats near hou&s;es much more precarious;
although I have &s;een them burrow near a vil|lage, &s;o as &s;carcely to be
extirpated. But, in general, they re&s;ide in woods or thick brakes, making
holes under ground of about two yards deep, commonly ending among the roots of
large treets, for greater &s;ecurity. In winter they frequent hou&s;es, and
make a common practice of robbing the hen-roo&s;t and the dairy.</P>
<P>The polecat is particularly de&s;tructive among pidgeons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>, when it gets into a
dove-hou&s;e; without making &s;o much noi&s;e as the wea&s;el, it does a great
deal more mi&s;chief; it di&s;|patches each with a &s;ingle wound in the head;
and, after killing a great number, and &s;atiating it&s;elf with their blood,
it then begins to think <PB N="366" REF="424"> of carrying them home. This it
carefully performs, going and returning, and bringing them one by one to its
hole; but if it &s;hould happen that the opening by which it got into the
dove-hou&s;e be not large enough for the body of the pidgeon to get through,
this mi&s;|chievous creature contents it&s;elf with carrying away the heads,
and makes a mo&s;t delicious fea&s;t upon the brains.</P>
<P>It is not le&s;s fond of honey, attacking the hives in winter, and
forcing the bees away. It does not remove far from hou&s;es in winter, as its
prey is not &s;o ea&s;ily found in the woods dur|ing that &s;ea&s;on. The
female brings forth her young in &s;ummer, to the number of five or &s;ix at a
time; the&s;e &s;he &s;oon trains to her own ra|pacious habits, &s;upplying the
want of milk, which no carnivorous quadrupede has in plenty, with the blood of
&s;uch animals as &s;he happens to &s;eize. The fur of this animal is
con&s;idered as &s;oft and warm; yet it is in le&s;s e&s;timation than &s;ome
of a much inferior kind, from its offen&s;ive &s;mell, which can never be
wholly removed, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The polecat &s;eems to be an inhabitant of

<HEAD>THE MARTIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Martin is a larger animal than any of the former, being
generally eighteen inches long, and the tail ten more. It differs from the
polecat, in being about four or five inches longer; its tail al&s;o is longer
in proportion, and more bu&s;hy at the end; its no&s;e is flatter; its cry is
&s;harper and more piercing; its colours are more elegant; and, what &s;till
adds to their beauty, its &s;cent, very unlike the former, in|&s;tead of being
offen&s;ive, is con&s;idered as a mo&s;t plea&s;ing perfume. The martin, in
&s;hort, is the mo&s;t beautiful of all Briti&s;h bea&s;ts of prey: its head is
&s;mall, and elegantly formed; its eyes lively; its ears are broad, rounded and
open; its back, its &s;ides, and tail, are covered with a fine thick downy fur,
with longer hair inter|mixed; the roots are a&s;h colour, the middle of 
<PB N="368" REF="429"> a bright che&s;nut, the points black; the head is brown,
with a &s;light ca&s;t of red; the legs, and upper &s;ides of the feet, are of
a chocolate colour; the palms, or under &s;ides, are covered with a thick down,
like that of the body; the feet are broad, the claws white, large and &s;harp,
well adapted for the purpo&s;es of climb|ing, but, as in others of the wea&s;el
kind, in|capable of being &s;heathed or un&s;heathed at plea&s;ure; the throat
and brea&s;t are white; the belly of the &s;ame colour with the back, but
rather paler; the hair on the tail is very long, e&s;pecially at the end, where
it appears much thicker than near the in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a variety of this animal, called the yellow
brea&s;ted martin, which in no re&s;pect differs from the former, except that
this has a yellow brea&s;t, whereas the other has a white one: the colour of
the body al&s;o is darker; and, as it lives more among trees than the other
martin, its fur is more valuable, beautiful and glo&s;&s;y. The former of
the&s;e Mr. Buffon calls the Fouine; the latter, &s;imply the Martin; and he
&s;uppo&s;es them to be a di&s;tinct &s;pecies: but as they differ only in
colour, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to embarra&s;s hi&s;tory by a new di&s;tinction,
where there is only &s;o minute a difference.</P>
<P>Of all animals of the wea&s;el kind, the martin 
<PB N="369" REF="430"> is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; all its motions &s;hew great
grace, as well as agility; and there is &s;carce an animal in our woods that
will venture to oppo&s;e it. Quadrupedes five times as big are ea&s;ily
vanqui&s;hed; the hare, the &s;heep, and even the wild cat it&s;elf, though
much &s;tronger, is not a match for the martin: and although carnivorous
animals are not fond of engaging each other, yet the wild cat and the martin
&s;eldom meet without a combat. Ge&s;ner tells us of one of this kind that he
kept tame, which was ex|tremely playful and pretty; it went among the hou&s;es
of the neighbourhood, and always re|turned home when hungry: it was extremely
fond of a dog that had been bred up with it, and u&s;ed to play with it as cats
are &s;een to play, lying on its back, and biting without anger or injury. That
which was kept tame by Mr. Buffon, was not quite &s;o &s;ocial: it was
dive&s;ted of its ferocity, but continued without attachment; and was &s;till
&s;o wild as to be obliged to be held by a chain. Whenever a cat appeared, it
prepared for war; and if any of the poultry came within its reach, it flew upon
them with avidity. Though it was tied by the middle of the body, it frequently
e&s;caped: at fir&s;t it returned after &s;ome hours, but without &s;eeming
plea&s;ed, and as if it only <PB N="370" REF="431"> came to be fed; the next
time it continued abroad longer; and, at la&s;t, went away without ever
returning. It was a female, and was, when it went off, a year and an half old;
and Mr. Buffon &s;uppo&s;es it to have gone in que&s;t of the male. It ate
every thing that was given it, except &s;allad or herbs; and it was remarkably
fond of honey. It was remarked that it drank often, and often &s;lept for two
days together; and that, in like manner, it was often two or three days without
&s;leeping. Before it went to &s;leep, it drew it&s;elf up into a round, hid
its head, and covered it with its tail. When awake it was in continual
agitation, and was obliged to be tied up, not le&s;s to prevent its attacking
the poultry than to hinder it from breaking whatever it came near, by the
capri|cious wildne&s;s of its motions.</P>
<P>The yellow brea&s;ted martin is much more common in France than in
England; and yet even there this variety is much &s;carcer than that with the
white brea&s;t. The latter keeps nearer hou&s;es and villages to make its petty
ravages among the &s;heep and the poultry; the other keeps in the woods, and
leads in every re&s;pect a &s;avage life, building its ne&s;t on the tops of
trees, and living upon &s;uch animals as are en|tirely wild like it&s;elf.
About night-fall it <PB N="371" REF="432"> u&s;ually quits its &s;olitude to
&s;eek its prey, hunts after &s;quirrels, rats, and rabbits; de&s;troys great
numbers of birds and their young, takes the eggs from the ne&s;t, and often
removes them to its own without breaking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brooke's
Natural Hi&s;tory.</BIBL></NOTE>. The in&s;tant the martin finds it&s;elf
pur&s;ued by dogs, for which purpo&s;e there is a peculiar breed, that &s;eem
fit for this chace only, it immediately makes to its retreat, which is
generally in the hollow of &s;ome tree, towards the top, and which it is
im|po&s;&s;ible to come at without cutting it down. Their ne&s;t is generally
the original tenement of the &s;quirrel, which that litttle animal be&s;towed
great pains in compleating; but the martin having killed and
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the little architect, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for
its own u&s;e, enlarges its dimen&s;ions, improves the &s;oftne&s;s of the bed,
and in that retreat brings forth its young. Its litter is never above three or
four at a time; they are brought forth with the eyes clo&s;ed, as in all the
re&s;t of this kind, and very &s;oon come to a &s;tate of perfection. The dam
compen&s;ates for her own deficiency of milk, by bringing them eggs and live
birds, accu&s;toming them from the beginning to a life of carnage and rapine.
When &s;he leads them from the ne&s;t into the woods, the <PB N="372" REF="433"> birds at once di&s;tingui&s;h their enemies and at|tend them, as we
before ob&s;erved of the fox, with all the marks of alarm and animo&s;ity.
Wherever the martin conducts her young, a flock of &s;mall birds are &s;een
threatening and in|&s;ulting her, alarming every thicket, and often directing
the hunter in his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The martin is &s;till more common in North-America than in any
part of Europe. The&s;e animals are found in all the northern parts of the
world, from Siberia to China and Canada. In every country they are hunted for
their furs, which are very valuable, and chiefly &s;o when taken in the
beginning of winter. The mo&s;t e&s;teemed part of the martin's &s;kin is that
part of it which is browner than the re&s;t, and &s;tretches along the
back-bone. Above twelve thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;kins are annually imported
into Eng|land from Hud&s;on's Bay, and above thirty thou&s;and from Canada.</P>

<HEAD>THE SABLE.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the cla&s;&s;es of the wea&s;el kind would have continued
utterly unknown and di&s;|regarded were it not for their furs, which are finer,
more glo&s;&s;y and &s;oft, than tho&s;e of any other quadrupede. Their
di&s;po&s;itions are fierce and untameable; their &s;cent generally
offen&s;ive; <PB N="373" REF="434"> and their figure di&s;proportioned and
unplea&s;ing. The knowledge of one or two of them would, therefore, have
&s;ufficed curio&s;ity; and the re&s;t would probably have been confounded
together, under one common name, as things u&s;ele&s;s and unintere&s;ting, had
not their &s;kins been coveted by the vain, and con&s;idered as capable of
adding to human magnificence or beauty.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e, however, the &s;kin of the &s;able is the mo&s;t
coveted, and held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem. It is of a browni&s;h black, and
the darker it is it becomes the more valuable. A &s;ingle &s;kin, though not
above four inches broad, is often valued at ten or fifteen pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Regnard.</BIBL></NOTE>; the fur differing from others in
this, that it has no grain; &s;o that, rub it which way you will, it is equally
&s;mooth and unre&s;i&s;ting. Neverthele&s;s, though this little animal's robe
was &s;o much co|veted by the great, its hi&s;tory till of late was but very
little known; and we are obliged to Mr. Jonelin for the fir&s;t accurate
de&s;cription of its form and nature<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xxvii. p. 113.</BIBL></NOTE>. From him we learn
that the &s;able re&s;embles the martin in form, and &s;ize, and the wea&s;el
in the number of its teeth; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that whereas the martin
has thirty-eight teeth, the wea&s;el has but thirty-four; in this re&s;pect,
therefore, the &s;able &s;eems to <PB N="374" REF="435"> make the &s;hade
between the&s;e two animals; being &s;haped like the one, and furni&s;hed with
teeth like the other. It is al&s;o furni&s;hed with very large whi&s;kers about
the mouth; its feet are broad and, as in the re&s;t of its kind, fur|ni&s;hed
with five claws on each foot. The&s;e are its con&s;tant marks; but its fur,
for which it is &s;o much valued, is not always the &s;ame. Some of this
&s;pecies are of a dark brown over all the body, except the ears and the
throat, where the hair is rather yellow; others are more of a yellowi&s;h
tincture, their ears and throat being al&s;o much paler. The&s;e in both are
the colours they have in winter, and which they are &s;een to change in the
beginning of the &s;pring; the former becoming of a yellow brown, the latter of
a pale yellow. In other re&s;pects they re&s;emble their kind, in vivacity,
agility, and inquietude; in &s;leeping by day and &s;eeking their prey by
night; in living upon &s;maller animals, and in the di&s;agreeable odour that
chiefly characterizes their race.</P>
<P>They generally inhabit along the banks of rivers, in &s;hady
places, and in the thicke&s;t woods. They leap with great ea&s;e from tree to
tree, and are &s;aid to be afraid of the &s;un, which tarni&s;hes the lu&s;tre
of their robes. They are chiefly hunted in winter for their &s;kins, 
<PB N="375" REF="436"> during which part of the year they are only in
&s;ea&s;on. They are mo&s;tly found in Siberia, and but very few in any other
country of the world; and this &s;carcity it is which enhances their value. The
hunting of the &s;able chiefly falls to the lot of the condemned criminals, who
are &s;ent from Ru&s;&s;ia into the&s;e wild and exten&s;ive fore&s;ts that,
for a great part of the year, are covered with &s;now; and in this in&s;tance,
as in many others, the luxuries and ornaments of the vain, are wrought out of
the dangers and the mi&s;eries of the wretched. The&s;e are obliged to
furni&s;h a certain number of &s;kins every year, and are puni&s;hed if the
proper quantity be not pro|vided.</P>
<P>The &s;able is al&s;o killed by the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, who
are &s;ent into tho&s;e parts to that end. They are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed a certain number of &s;kins
yearly, like the former, and are obliged to &s;hoot with only a &s;ingle ball,
to avoid &s;poiling the &s;kin, or el&s;e with cro&s;s-bows and blunt arrows.
As an encouragement to the hunters, they are al|lowed to &s;hare among
them&s;elves the &s;urplus of tho&s;e &s;kins which they thus procure; and
this, in the proce&s;s of &s;ix or &s;even years, amounts to a very
con&s;iderable &s;um. A colonel, during his &s;even years &s;tay, gains about
four thou&s;and crowns for his &s;hare, and the common men &s;ix or &s;even
hundred each for theirs.</P>

<HEAD>THE ICHNEUMON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ichneumon, which &s;ome have inju|diciou&s;ly denominated the
Cat of Pharaoh, is one of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful animals of all the
wea&s;el kind. In the kingdom of Egypt, where it is chiefly bred, it is u&s;ed
for the &s;ame purpo&s;es that cats are in Europe, and is even more
&s;erviceable, as being more expert in catch|ing mice than they. This animal is
u&s;ually of the &s;ize of the martin, and greatly re&s;embles it in
appearance, except that the hair, which is of a gri&s;ly black, is much rougher
and le&s;s downy. The tail al&s;o is not &s;o bu&s;hy at the end; and each hair
in particular has three or four colours, which are &s;een in different
di&s;po|&s;itions of its body. Under its rougher hairs, there is a &s;ofter fur
of a browni&s;h colour, the rough hair being about two inches long, but that of
the muzzle extremely &s;hort, as likewi&s;e that on the legs and paws. However,
being long &s;ince brought into a dome&s;tic &s;tate, there are many varieties
in this animal; &s;ome being much larger than the martin, others much le&s;s;
&s;ome being of a lighter mixture of colours, and &s;ome being &s;treaked in
the manner of a cat.</P>
<P>The Ichneumon, with all the &s;trength of a cat, has more
in&s;tinct and agility; a more uni|ver&s;al <PB N="377" REF="438"> appetite for
carnage, and a greater va|riety of powers to procure it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The re&s;t of this de&s;cription is extracted from Mr. Buffon,
except where marked with commas.</NOTE>. Rats, mice, birds, &s;erpents, lizards
and in&s;ects, are all equally pur&s;ued; it attacks every living thing which
it is able to overcome, and indi&s;crimi|nately preys on fle&s;h of all kinds.
Its courage is equal to the vehemence of its appetite. It fears neither the
force of the dog nor the in&s;i|dious malice of the cat; neither the claws of
the vulture nor the poi&s;on of the viper. It makes war upon all kinds of
&s;erpents with great avidity, &s;eizes and kills them how venomous &s;oever
they be; and we are told that when it begins to perceive the effects of their
rage, it has recour&s;e to a certain root, which the Indians call after its
name, and a&s;&s;ert to be an antidote for the bite of the a&s;p or the
viper.</P>
<P>But what this animal is particularly &s;ervice|able to the
Egyptians for is, that it di&s;covers and de&s;troys the eggs of the crocodile.
It al&s;o kills the young ones that have not as yet been able to reach the
water; and, as fable u&s;ually goes hand in hand with truth, it is &s;aid that
the ichneumon &s;ometimes enters the mouth of the crocodile, when it is found
&s;leeping on the &s;hore, boldly attacks the enemy in the in&s;ide, 
<PB N="378" REF="439"> and at length, when it has effectually de&s;troyed it,
it eats its way out again.</P>
<P>The ichneumon when wild generally re&s;ides along the banks of
rivers; and in times of inun|dation makes to the higher ground, often
ap|proaching inhabited places in que&s;t of prey. It goes forward &s;ilently
and cautiou&s;ly, chang|ing its manner of moving according to its
ne|ce&s;&s;ities. Sometimes it carries the head high, &s;hortens its body, and
rai&s;es it&s;elf upon its legs; &s;ometimes it lengthens it&s;elf and &s;eems
to creep along the ground; it is often ob&s;erved to &s;it upon its hind legs,
like a dog when taught to beg; but more commonly it is &s;een to dart like an
arrow upon its prey, and &s;eize it with inevit|able certainty. Its eyes are
&s;prightly and full of fire, its phy&s;iognomy &s;en&s;ible, its body nimble,
its tail long, and its hair rough and various. Like all of its kind, it has
glands that open behind and furni&s;h an odorous &s;ub&s;tance. Its no&s;e is
too &s;harp and its mouth too &s;mall to permit its &s;eizing things that are
large; however, it makes up by its courage and activity its want of arms; it
ea&s;ily &s;trangles a cat though &s;tronger and larger than it&s;elf; and
often fights with dogs, which, though never &s;o bold, learn to dread the
ichneumon as a formidable enemy. It al&s;o takes the water like an otter, and,
as we are told, will continue under it much longer.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="440">This animal grows fa&s;t and dies &s;oon. It
is found in great numbers in all the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia, from Egypt to
Java; and it is al&s;o found in Africa, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope.
It is dome&s;tic, as was &s;aid, in Egypt; but in our colder climates it is not
ea&s;y to breed or maintain them, as they are not able to &s;upport the rigour
of our winters. Ne|verthele&s;s they take every precaution that in|&s;tinct can
dictate to keep them&s;elves warm; they wrap them&s;elves up into a ball,
hiding the head between the legs, and in this manner continue to &s;leep all
day long. 
<Q REND="inline">"Seba had one &s;ent him from the i&s;land of
Ceylon, which he permitted to run for &s;ome months about the hou&s;e. It was
heavy and &s;lothful by day, and often could not be awaked even with a blow;
but it made up this indolence by its nocturnal activity, &s;melling about
without either being wholly tame or wholly mi&s;chievous. It climbed up the
walls and the trees with very great ea&s;e, and appeared extremely fond of
&s;piders and worms, which it preferred probably from their re&s;emblance to
&s;erpents, its mo&s;t na|tural food. It was al&s;o particularly eager to
&s;cratch up holes in the ground; and, this added to its wildne&s;s and
uncleanline&s;s, obliged our naturali&s;t to &s;mother it in &s;pirits, in

repre&s;entatives of God below. Indeed, if we con&s;ider the number of eggs
which the cro|codile lays in the &s;and at a time, which often amount to three

</FIGURE> <PB N="381" REF="443"> fur, but both obviou&s;ly of the
wea&s;el kind, as appears not only from their figure and odour, but al&s;o from
their di&s;po&s;ition. The <HI>&s;qua&s;h</HI> is about the &s;ize of a
polecat, its hair of a deep brown, but principally differing from all of this
kind in having only four toes on the feet before, whereas all other wea&s;els
have five. The <HI>&s;kink,</HI> which I take to be Cate&s;by's Virginia
polecat, re&s;embles a polecat in &s;hape and &s;ize, but par|ticularly differs
in the length of its hair and colour. The hair is above three inches and an
half long, and that at the end of the tail above four inches. The colour is
partly black and partly white, variou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed over the body, very
glo&s;&s;y, long, and beautiful. There &s;eem to be two varieties more of this
animal, which Mr. Buffon calls the Conepate and the Zorille. He &s;uppo&s;es
each to be a di&s;tinct &s;pecies: but as they are both &s;aid to re&s;emble
the polecat in form, and both to be cloathed with long fur of a black and white
colour, it &s;eems needle&s;s to make a di&s;tinction. The conepate re&s;embles
the &s;kink in all things except in &s;ize, being &s;maller, and in the
di&s;po&s;ition of its colours, which are more exact, having five white
&s;tripes upon a black ground, running longitudinally from the head to the
tail. The Zorille re&s;embles the &s;kink, but is rather &s;maller and more
beauti|fully <PB REF="444"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="381" REF="445"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="382" REF="446"> coloured, its &s;treaks of black and white being more
di&s;tinct, and the colours of its tail being black at its in&s;ertion and
white at the ex|tremity; whereas in the &s;kink they are all of one grey
colour.</P>
<P>But whatever differences there may be in the figure or colour of
the&s;e little animals, they all agree in one common affection, that of being
intolerably foetid and loath&s;ome. I have already ob&s;erved that all the
wea&s;el kind have glands furni&s;hing an odorous matter, near the anus, the
conduits of which generally have their aperture ju&s;t at its opening. That
&s;ub&s;tance which is &s;tored up in the&s;e receptacles, is in &s;ome of this
kind, &s;uch as in the martin, already mentioned, and al&s;o in the genet and
the civet, to be de&s;cribed hereafter, a mo&s;t grateful per|fume; but in the
wea&s;el, the ermine, the ferret, and the polecat, it is extremely foetid and
of|fen&s;ive. The&s;e glands in the animals now under con&s;ideration are much
larger, and furni&s;h a matter &s;ublimed to a degree of putre&s;cence that is
truly amazing. As to the perfumes of mu&s;k and civet, we know that a &s;ingle
grain will dif|fu&s;e it&s;elf over a whole hou&s;e, and continue for months to
&s;pread an agreeable odour, without diminution. However, the perfume of the
mu&s;k or the civet is nothing, either for &s;trength or <PB N="383" REF="447">
duration, to the in&s;upportable odour of the&s;e. It is u&s;ually voided with
their excrement; and if but a &s;ingle drop happens to touch any part of a
man's garment, it is more than probable that he can never wear any part of it
more.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the effects produced by the ex|crement of the&s;e
animals, we often hear of its rai&s;ing this diabolical &s;mell by its urine.
How|ever, of this I am apt to doubt; and it &s;hould &s;eem to me, that, as all
the wea&s;el kind have their excrements &s;o extremely foetid from the cau&s;e
above-mentioned, we may con&s;ider the&s;e al&s;o as being foetid from the
&s;ame cau&s;es. Be&s;ides, they are not furni&s;hed with glands to give their
urine &s;uch a &s;mell; and the analogy between them and the wea&s;el kind
being &s;o &s;trong in other re&s;pects, we may &s;uppo&s;e they re&s;emble
each other in this. It has al&s;o been &s;aid that they take this method of
ejecting their excre|ment to defend them&s;elves again&s;t their pur|&s;uers;
but it is much more probable that this ejection is the convul&s;ive effect of
terror, and that it &s;erves as their defence without their own concurrence.
Certain it is that they never &s;mell thus horridly except when enraged or
affrighted, for they are often kept tame about the hou&s;es of the planters of
America without being very offen&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="448">The habitudes of all the&s;e animals are the
&s;ame, living like all the re&s;t of the wea&s;el kind, as they prey upon
&s;maller animals and birds eggs. The &s;qua&s;h, for in&s;tance, burrows like
the pole|cat in the clefts of rocks, where it brings forth its young. It often
&s;teals into farm-yards, and kills the poultry, eating only their brains. Nor
is it &s;afe to pur&s;ue or offend it, for then it calls up all its &s;cents,
which are its mo&s;t powerful protection. At that time neither men nor dogs
will offer to approach it; the &s;cent is &s;o &s;trong that it reaches for
half a mile round, and more near at hand is almo&s;t &s;tifling. If the dogs
continue to pur&s;ue, it does all in its power to e&s;cape, by getting up a
tree, or by &s;ome &s;uch means; but if driven to an extremity, it then lets
fly upon the hunters; and if it &s;hould happen that a drop of this foetid
di&s;charge falls in the eye, the per&s;on runs the ri&s;que of being blinded
for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Voyage de Kalm, as quoted by Buffon, vol
xxvii. p. 93.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dogs them&s;elves in&s;tantly abate of their ardour when they
find this extraordinary battery played off again&s;t them; they in&s;tantly
turn tail, and leave the animal undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the field; and no
exhortations can ever bring them to rally. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1749," &s;ays Kalm, "one of the&s;e
animals came near the farm where I <PB N="385" REF="449"> lived. It was in
winter time, and during the night; and the dogs that were upon the watch,
pur&s;ued it for &s;ome time, until it di&s;charged again&s;t them. Although I
was in my bed a good way off, I thought I &s;hould have been &s;uffocated; and
the cows and oxen them&s;elves, by their lowings, &s;hewed how much they were
affected by the &s;tench. About the end of the &s;ame year, another of the&s;e
animals crept into our cellar, but did not exhale the &s;malle&s;t &s;cent,
becau&s;e it was not di&s;turbed. A fooli&s;h woman, however, who perceived it
at night, by the &s;hining of its eyes, killed it, and at that moment its
&s;tench began to &s;pread. The whole cellar was filled with it to &s;uch a
degree, that the woman kept her bed for &s;everal days after; and all the
bread, meat, and other provi&s;ions, that were kept there, were &s;o infected,
that they were obliged to be thrown out of doors."</Q> Neverthele&s;s, many of
the planters, and the native Americans, keep this animal tame about their
hou&s;es; and &s;eldom perceive any di&s;agreeable &s;cents, except it is
injured or frighted. They are al&s;o known to eat its fle&s;h, which &s;ome
a&s;&s;ert to be tolerable food; however, they take care to deprive it of
tho&s;e glands which are &s;o horridly offen&s;ive.</P>

<PB N="386" REF="450">
<HEAD>THE GENETT.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the &s;qua&s;h, which is the mo&s;t of|fen&s;ive animal in
nature, we come to the Genett, which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and
plea&s;ing. In&s;tead of the horrid &s;tench with which the for|mer affects us,
this has a mo&s;t grateful odour; more faint than civet, but to &s;ome, for
that rea&s;on, more agreeable. This animal is rather le&s;s than the martin;
though there are genetts of different &s;izes; and I have &s;een one rather
larger. It al&s;o differs &s;omewhat in the form of its body. It is not ea&s;y,
in words, to give an idea of the di&s;tinction. It re&s;embles all tho&s;e of
the wea&s;el kind, in its length, compared to its heighth; it re&s;embles them
in having a &s;oft beautiful fur, in having its feet armed with claws that
cannot be &s;heathed, and in its appe|tite for petty carnage. But then it
differs from them in having the no&s;e much &s;maller and longer, rather
re&s;embling that of a fox than a wea&s;el. The tail al&s;o, in&s;tead of being
bu&s;hy, tapers to a point, and is much longer; its ears are larger, and its
paws &s;maller. As to its colours, and figure in general, the genett is
&s;potted with black, upon a ground mixed with red and grey. It has two &s;orts
of hair, the one &s;horter and <PB N="387" REF="451"> &s;ofter, the other
longer and &s;tronger, but not above half an inch long on any part of its body,
except the tail. Its &s;pots are di&s;tinct and &s;eparate upon the &s;ides,
but unite towards the back, and form black &s;tripes, which run longitudinally
from the neck backwards. It has al&s;o along the back a kind of mane or
longi&s;h hair, which forms a black &s;treak from the head to the tail, which
la&s;t is marked with rings, al|ternately black and white, its whole
length.</P>
<P>The genett, like all the re&s;t of the wea&s;el kinds, has glands,
that &s;eparate a kind of per|fume, re&s;embling civet, but which &s;oon flies
off. The&s;e glands open differently from tho&s;e of other animals of this
kind; for, as the latter have their apertures ju&s;t at the opening of the
anus, the&s;e have their aperture immediately under it; &s;o that the male
&s;eems, for this rea&s;on, to the &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, to be of two
&s;exes.</P>
<P>It re&s;embles the martin very much in its habits and
di&s;po&s;ition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol. xix. p.
187.</BIBL></NOTE>; except, that it &s;eems tamed much more ea&s;ily. Bellonius
a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een them in the hou&s;es at Con&s;tan|tinople as
tame as cats; and that they were permitted to run every where about, without
doing the lea&s;t mi&s;chief. For this rea&s;on they <PB N="388" REF="452">
have been called the Cats of Con&s;tantinople; although they have little el&s;e
in common with that animal, except their &s;kill in &s;pying out and
de&s;troying vermin. Naturali&s;ts pretend that it inhabits only the moi&s;ter
grounds, and chiefly re&s;ides along the banks of rivers, having never been
found in mountains, nor dry places. The &s;pecies is not much diffu&s;ed; it is
not to be found in any part of Europe, except Spain and Turky; it requires a
warm climate to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and multiply in; and yet it is not to be found in
the warmer regions either of India or Africa. From &s;uch as have &s;een its
u&s;es at Con&s;tanti|nople, I learn, that it is one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful,
cleanly, and indu&s;trious animals in the world; that it keeps whatever hou&s;e
it is in, perfectly free from mice and rats, which cannot endure its &s;mell.
Add to this, its nature is mild and gentle, its colours various and glo&s;&s;y,
its fur valuable; and, upon the whole, it &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e animals
that, with proper care, might be propagated among&s;t us, and might become one
of the mo&s;t &s;erviceable of our dome&s;tics.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE CIVET.</HEAD>
<P>PROCEEDING from the &s;maller to the greater of this kind, we
come, in the la&s;t place, <PB N="389" REF="453"> to the Civet, which is much
larger than any of the former; for as the martin is not above &s;ix|teen inches
long, the civet is found to be above thirty. Mr. Buffon di&s;tingui&s;hes this
&s;pecies into two kinds; one of which he calls the Civet, and the other the
Zibet. The latter principally differs from the former in having the body longer
and more &s;lender, the no&s;e &s;maller, the ears longer and broader; no mane
or long hair running down the back in the latter; and the tail is longer and
better marked with rings of different colours, from one end to the other.
The&s;e are the differences which have induced this great naturali&s;t to
&s;uppo&s;e them animals of di&s;tinct &s;pecies; and to allot each a
&s;eparate de&s;cription. How far future experience may confirm this
conjecture, time mu&s;t di&s;cover; but certain it is, that if &s;uch &s;mall
varieties make a &s;eparate cla&s;s, there may be many other animals equally
entitled to peculiar di&s;tinction that now are cla&s;&s;ed together. We
&s;hall, therefore, content our&s;elves, at pre&s;ent, with con&s;idering, as
former naturali&s;ts have done, the&s;e two merely as varieties of the &s;ame
animal, and only altered in figure, by climate, food, or education.</P>
<P>The civet re&s;embles animals of the wea&s;el kind in the long
&s;lenderne&s;s of its body, the <PB N="390" REF="454"> &s;hortne&s;s of its
legs, the odorous matter that exudes from the glands behind, the &s;oftne&s;s
of its fur, the number of its claws, and their inca|pacity of being &s;heathed.
It differs from them in being much larger than any hitherto de&s;cribed; in
having the no&s;e lengthened, &s;o as to re&s;emble that of the fox; the tail
long, and tapering to a point; and its ears &s;trait, like tho&s;e of a cat.
The colour of the civet varies: it is com|monly a&s;h, &s;potted with black;
though it is whiter in the female, tending to yellow; and the &s;pots are much
larger, like tho&s;e of a panther. The colour on the belly, and under the
throat, is black; whereas the other parts of the body are black or &s;treaked
with grey. This animal varies in its colour, being &s;ometimes &s;treaked, as
in our kind of cats called Tabbies. It has whi&s;kers, like the re&s;t of its
kind; and its eye is black and beautiful.</P>
<P>The opening of the pouch or bag, which is the receptacle of the
civet, differs from that of the re&s;t of the wea&s;el kind, not opening into
but under the anus. Be&s;ide this opening, which is large, there is &s;till
another lower down; but for what purpo&s;es de&s;igned, is not known. The pouch
it&s;elf is about two inches and an half broad, and two long; its opening makes
a chink, from the top downwards, that is about <PB N="391" REF="455"> two
inches and an half long; and it is covered on the edges, and within, with
&s;hort hair: when the two &s;ides are drawn a&s;under, the in|ward cavity may
be &s;een, large enough to hold a &s;mall pullet's egg; all round this are
&s;mall glands, opening and furni&s;hing that &s;trong perfume which is &s;o
well known, and is found, in this pouch, of the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of
pomatum. Tho&s;e who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to breed the&s;e animals for
their perfume, u&s;u|ally take it from them twice or thrice a week, and
&s;ometimes oftener. The animal is kept in a long &s;ort of a box, in which it
cannot turn round. The per&s;on, therefore, opens this box behind, drags the
animal backwards by the tail, keeps it in this po&s;ition by a bar before, and,
with a wooden &s;poon, takes the civet from the pouch, as carefully as he can;
then lets the tail go, and &s;huts the box again. The perfume, thus procured,
is put into a ve&s;&s;el, which he takes care to keep &s;hut; and when a
&s;ufficient quantity is procured, it is &s;old to very great advantage.</P>
<P>The civet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon, vol.
xix.</BIBL></NOTE>, although a native of the warme&s;t climates, is yet found
to live in tem|perate, and even cold countries, provided it be defended
carefully from the injuries of the air. <PB N="392" REF="456"> Wherefore, it is
not only bred among the Turks, the Indians, and Africans, but great numbers of
the&s;e animals are al&s;o bred in Hol|land, where this &s;craping people make
no &s;mall gain of its perfume. The perfume of Am&s;terdam is reckoned the
pure&s;t of any; the people of other countries adulterating it with gums, and
other matters, which dimini&s;h its value, but encrea&s;e its weight. The
quantity which a &s;ingle animal affords generally depends upon its health and
nouri&s;hment. It gives more in pro|portion as it is more delicately and
abundantly fed. Raw fle&s;h, ha&s;hed &s;mall, eggs, rice, birds, young fowls,
and particularly fi&s;h, are the kinds of food the civet mo&s;t delights in.
The&s;e are to be changed and altered, to &s;uit and entice its appetite, and
continue its health. It gets but very little water; and although it drinks but
rarely, yet it makes urine very frequently; and, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, we
cannot, as in other animals, di&s;tingui&s;h the male from the female.</P>
<P>The perfume of the civet is &s;o &s;trong that it communicates
it&s;elf to all parts of the animal's body; the fur is impregnated thereby, and
the &s;kin penetrated to &s;uch a degree that it con|tinues to pre&s;erve the
odour for a long time after it is &s;tript off. If a per&s;on be &s;hut up with
one <PB N="393" REF="457"> of them in a clo&s;e room, he cannot &s;upport the
perfume, which is &s;o copiou&s;ly diffu&s;ed. When the animal is irritated, as
in all the wea&s;el kind, its &s;cent is much more violent than ordinary; and
if it be tormented &s;o as to make it &s;weat, this al&s;o is a &s;trong
perfume, and &s;erves to adul|terate or encrea&s;e what is otherwi&s;e obtained
from it In general, it is &s;old in Holland, for about fifty &s;hillings an
ounce; though, like all other commodities, its value alters in propor|tion to
the demand. Civet mu&s;t be cho&s;en new, of a good con&s;i&s;tence, a
whiti&s;h colour, and a &s;trong, di&s;agreeable &s;mell. There is &s;till a
very con&s;iderable traffic carried on from Bu&s;&s;erah, Calicut, and other
places in India, where the animal that produces it is bred; from the Levant
al&s;o, from Guinea, and e&s;pecially from Bra&s;il, in South America,
al|though Mr. Buffon is of opinion that the ani|mal is a native only of the Old
Continent, and not to be found wild in the New. The be&s;t civet, however, is
furni&s;hed, as was ob&s;erved, by the Dutch, though not in &s;uch quantities
at pre&s;ent as &s;ome years pa&s;t, when this perfume was more in fa&s;hion.
Civet is a much more grateful perfume than mu&s;k, to which it has &s;ome
re&s;emblance; and was &s;ome years ago u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;es in
medicine. But, <PB N="394" REF="458"> at pre&s;ent, it is quite di&s;continued
in pre|&s;cription; and per&s;ons of ta&s;te or elegance &s;eem to pro&s;cribe
it even from the toilet. Perfumes, like dre&s;s, have their vici&s;&s;itudes;
mu&s;k was in peculiar repute, until di&s;placed by civet; both gave ground,
upon di&s;covering the manner of preparing ambergrea&s;e; and even this is now
difu&s;ed for the le&s;s powerful vegetable kinds of fragrance, &s;pirit of
lavender, or otter of ro&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, the civet is &s;aid to be a wild fierce animal;
and, although &s;ometimes tamed, is never thoroughly familiar. Its teeth are
&s;trong and cutting, although its claws be feeble and inflexible. It is light
and active, and lives by prey, as the re&s;t of its kind, pur&s;uing birds, and
other &s;mall animals that it is able to over|come. They are &s;ometimes &s;een
&s;tealing into the yards and outhou&s;es, to &s;eize upon the poultry: their
eyes &s;hine in the night, and it is very probable that they &s;ee better in
the dark than by day. When they fail of animal food, they are found to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t upon roots and fruits, and very &s;eldom drink; for which
rea&s;on they are never found near great waters. They breed very fa&s;t in
their native climates, where the heat &s;eems to condu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e to their propagation; but in our temperate latitudes,

<HEAD>THE GLUTTON.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL add but one animal more to this numerous cla&s;s of the
wea&s;el kind; namely, the Glutton; which, for &s;everal rea&s;ons, &s;eems to
belong to this tribe, and this only. We have hitherto had no preci&s;e
de&s;cription of this quadrupede; &s;ome re&s;embling it to a badger, &s;ome to
a fox, and &s;ome to an hyaena. Lin|naeus places it among the wea&s;els, from
the &s;imilitude of its teeth; it &s;hould &s;eem to me to re&s;emble this
animal &s;till more, from the great length of its body, and the &s;hortne&s;s
of its legs, from the &s;oftne&s;s of its fur, its di&s;agreeable &s;cent, and
its in&s;atiable appetite for animal food. Mr. Klein, who &s;aw one of them
which was brought alive from Siberia, a&s;&s;ures us, that it was about three
feet long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;ays it was an ell, eight inches long; I
have, therefore, given its length as &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a Flemi&s;h ell,
which is twenty-&s;even inches.</NOTE>, and about a foot and an half high. If
we compare the&s;e dimen&s;ions with tho&s;e of other animals, we &s;hall find,
that they approach more nearly to the cla&s;s we are at <PB N="396" REF="463">
pre&s;ent de&s;cribing than any other; and that the glutton may very ju&s;tly
be conceived under the form of a great overgrown wea&s;el. Its no&s;e, its
ears, its teeth, and its long bu&s;hy tail, are entirely &s;imilar; and as to
what is &s;aid of its being rather corpulent than &s;lender, it is mo&s;t
probable that tho&s;e who de&s;cribed it thus &s;aw it after eating, at which
time its belly we are a&s;&s;ured is mo&s;t mon&s;trou&s;ly di&s;tended:
however, &s;u&s;pending all certainty upon this &s;ubject, I will take leave
rather to follow Linnaeus than Buffon in de&s;cribing this animal; and leave
future experience to judge between them.</P>
<P>The glutton, which is &s;o called from its vo|racious appetite, is
an animal found as well in the north of Europe and Siberia, as in the north
parts of America, where it has the name of the Carcajou. Amid&s;t the variety
of de&s;crip|tions which have been given of it, no very ju&s;t idea can be
formed of its figure; and, indeed, &s;ome naturali&s;ts, among whom was Ray,
en|tirely doubted of its exi&s;tence. From the be&s;t accounts, however, we
have of it, the body is thick and long, the legs &s;hort; it is black along the
back, and of a reddi&s;h brown on the &s;ides; its fur is held in the highe&s;t
e&s;timation, for its &s;oftne&s;s and beautiful glo&s;s; the tail is bu&s;hy,
like that of the wea&s;el, but rather &s;horter; and <PB N="397" REF="464"> its
legs and claws better fitted for climbing trees, than for running along the
ground. Thus far it entirely re&s;embles the wea&s;el; and its manner of taking
its prey is al&s;o by &s;urprize, and not by pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Scarce any of the animals with &s;hort legs and long bodies,
pur&s;ue their prey; but, know|ing their own incapacity to overtake it by
&s;wiftne&s;s, either creep upon it in its retreats, or wait in ambu&s;h, and
&s;eize it with a bound. The glutton, from the make of its legs, and the length
of its body, mu&s;t be particularly &s;low; and, con&s;equently, its only
re&s;ource is in taking its prey by &s;urprize. All the re&s;t of the wea&s;el
kind, from the &s;mallne&s;s of their &s;ize, are better fitted for a life of
in&s;idious ra|pine than this; they can pur&s;ue their prey into its retreats,
they can lurk un&s;een among the branches of trees, and hide them&s;elves with
ea&s;e under the leaves: but the glutton is too large to follow &s;mall prey
into their retreats; nor would &s;uch, even if obtained, be &s;ufficient to
&s;u&s;tain it. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, this animal &s;eems naturally
compelled to the life for which it has long been remarkable. Its only
re&s;ource is to climb a tree, which it does with great ea&s;e, and there it
waits with patience until &s;ome large animal pa&s;&s;es underneath, upon 
<PB N="398" REF="465"> which it darts down with unerring certainty, and
de&s;troys it.</P>
<P>It is chiefly in North America that this vo|racious creature is
&s;een lurking among the thick branches of trees, in order to &s;urprize the
deer, with which the exten&s;ive fore&s;ts of that part of the world abound.
Endued with a degree of patience equal to its rapacity, the glutton &s;ingles
out &s;uch trees as it ob&s;erves marked by the teeth or the antlers of the
deer; and is known to remain there watching for &s;everal days together. If it
has fixed upon a wrong tree, and finds that the deer have either left that part
of the country, or cautiou&s;ly &s;hun the place, it reluctantly de&s;cends,
pur&s;ues the beaver to its retreat, or even ventures into the water in
pur&s;uit of fi&s;hes. But if it happens that, by long attention, and keeping
clo&s;e, at la&s;t the elk or the rein-deer happens to pa&s;s that way, it at
once darts down upon them, &s;ticks its claws between their &s;houlders, and
remains there unalterably firm. It is in vain that the large frighted animal
encrea&s;es its &s;peed, or threatens with its branching horns; the glut|ton
having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its po&s;t, nothing can drive it off; its
enormous prey drives ra|pidly along among&s;t the thicke&s;t woods, rubs
it&s;elf again&s;t the large&s;t trees and tears down <PB N="399" REF="466">
the branches with its expanded horns; but &s;till its in&s;atiable foe &s;ticks
behind, eating its neck, and digging its pa&s;&s;age to the great
blood-ve&s;&s;els that lie in that part. Travellers who wander through tho&s;e
de&s;arts, often &s;ee pieces of the glutton's &s;kin &s;ticking to the trees,
again&s;t which it was rubbed by the deer. But the animal's voracity is greater
than its feelings, and it never &s;eizes without bringing down its prey. When,
therefore, the deer, wounded, and feeble with the lo&s;s of blood, falls, the
glutton is &s;een to make up for its former ab|&s;tinence, by its pre&s;ent
voracity. As it is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fea&s;t of this kind every day,
it re&s;olves to lay in a &s;tore to &s;erve it for a good while to come. It is
indeed amazing how much one of the&s;e animals can eat at a time! That which
was &s;een by Mr. Klein, although without exerci&s;e or air, although taken
from its native climate, and enjoying but an indifferent &s;tate of health, was
yet &s;een to eat thirteen pounds of fle&s;h every day, and yet remained
un&s;atisfied. We may, therefore, ea&s;ily conceive how much more it mu&s;t
devour at once, after a long fa&s;t, of a food of its own procuring, and in the
climate mo&s;t natural to its con&s;titution. We are told, accordingly, that
from being a lank thin animal, which it naturally is, it then gorges 
<PB N="400" REF="467"> in &s;uch quantities, that its belly is di&s;tended, and
its whole figure &s;eems to alter. Thus vo|raciou&s;ly it continues eating
till, incapable of any other animal function, it lies totally torpid by the
animal it has killed; and in this &s;ituation continues for two or three days.
In this loath|&s;ome and helple&s;s &s;tate it finds its chief pro|tection from
its horrid &s;mell, which few ani|mals care to come near<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;t. p. 67.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;o that it continues
eating and &s;leeping till its prey be devoured, bones and all; and then it
mounts a tree, in que&s;t of another adventure.</P>
<P>The glutton, like many others of the wea&s;el kind, &s;eems to
prefer the mo&s;t putrid fle&s;h to that newly killed; and &s;uch is the
voraciou&s;|ne&s;s of this hateful creature, that, if its &s;wiftne&s;s and
&s;trength were equal to its rapacity, it would &s;oon thin the fore&s;t of
every other living crea|ture. But, fortunately, it is &s;o &s;low that there is
&s;carce a quadrupede that cannot e&s;cape it, ex|cept the beaver. This,
therefore, it very fre|quently pur&s;ues upon land; but the beaver ge|nerally
makes good its retreat by taking to the water, where the glutton has no chance
to &s;uc|ceed. This pur&s;uit only happens in &s;ummer; for in the winter all
that remains is to attack the beaver's hou&s;e, as at that time it never
&s;tirs <PB N="401" REF="468"> from home. This attack, however, &s;eldom
&s;ucceeds; for the beaver has a covert way bored under the ice, and the
glutton has only the trouble and di&s;appointment of &s;acking an empty
town.</P>
<P>A life of nece&s;&s;ity generally produces a good fertile
invention. The glutton, continually pre&s;&s;ed by the call of appetite, and
having neither &s;wiftne&s;s nor activity to &s;atisfy it, is obliged to make
up by &s;tratagem the defects of nature. It is often &s;een to examine the
traps and the &s;nares laid for other animals, in order to anticipate the
fowlers. It is &s;aid to practi&s;e a thou&s;and arts to procure its prey, to
&s;teal upon the retreats of the rein-deer, the fle&s;h of which animal it
loves in preference to all others; to lie in wait for &s;uch animals as have
been maimed by the hunters; to pur&s;ue the i&s;atis while it is hunting for
it&s;elf; and, when that animal has run down its prey, to come in and &s;eize
upon the whole, and &s;ometimes to devour even its poor provider; when the&s;e
pur&s;uits fail, even to dig up the graves, and fall upon the bodies in|terred
there, devouring them bones and all. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the natives of the
countries where the glutton inhabits, hold it in utter dete&s;tation, and
u&s;ually term it the vulture of quadrupedes. And yet, it is extraordinary
enough, that, being <PB N="402" REF="469"> &s;o very obnoxious to man, it does
not &s;eem to fear him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Buffon.</BIBL></NOTE>. We
are told by Gemelin of one of the&s;e coming up boldly and calmly where there
were &s;everal per&s;ons at work, without te&s;tifying the &s;malle&s;t
apprehen&s;ion, or attempting to run until it had received &s;everal blows,
that at la&s;t totally di&s;abled it. In all probability it came among them
&s;eeking its prey; and, having been u&s;ed to attack animals of inferior
&s;trength, it had no idea of a force &s;uperior to its own. The glutton, like
all the re&s;t of its kind, is a &s;olitary animal; and is never &s;een in
company except with its female, with which it couples in the mid&s;t of winter.
The latter goes with young about four months, and brings forth two or three at
a time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Linnaei Sy&s;tem. p.
67.</BIBL></NOTE>. They burrow in holes as the wea&s;el; and the male and
female are ge|nerally found together, both equally re&s;olute in defence of
their young. Upon this occa&s;ion the bolde&s;t dogs are afraid to approach
them; they fight ob&s;tinately and bite mo&s;t cruelly. However, as they are
unable to e&s;cape by flight, the hunters come in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the dogs, and ea&s;ily overpower them. Their fle&s;h, it may readily be
&s;uppo&s;ed, is not fit to be eaten; but the &s;kins amply recompence the
hunters for their toil and danger. The fur has <PB N="403" REF="470"> the
mo&s;t beautiful lu&s;tre that can be imagined, and is preferred before all
others, except that of the Siberian fox, or the &s;able. Among other
peculiarities of this animal, Linnaeus informs us, that it is very difficult to
be &s;kinned; but from what cau&s;e, whether its abominable &s;tench, or the
&s;kin's tenacity to the fle&s;h, he has not thought fit to inform us.</P>
