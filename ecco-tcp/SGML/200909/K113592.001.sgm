<P>THE Applau&s;e be&s;towed on the ROMAN HISTORY, written by Dr.
GOLD|SMITH, induced that Gentleman to complete his Plan, by writing a HISTORY
OF GREECE.</P>
<P>The Work was printed off when the Re|public of Letters was
deprived of one of its brighte&s;t Ornaments. Since the Author's Decea&s;e, the
Work has been peru&s;ed by &s;eve|ral of his learned Friends, who are of
Opi|nion, that it has an equal Claim to that Ap|probation which the ROMAN
HISTORY re|ceived from the Public.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the earlie&s;t State of GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t notices we have of every coun|try are fabulous and
uncertain. Among an unenlightened people every impo&s;ture is likely to take
place, for ignorance is the parent of credulity. Nothing therefore which the
Greeks have tran&s;mitted to us concerning their earlie&s;t &s;tate can be
relied on. Poets were the fir&s;t who began to record the actions of their
coun|trymen, and it is a part of their art to &s;trike the imagination even at
the expence of proba|bility. <PB N="2" REF="5"> For this rea&s;on, in the
earlie&s;t accounts of Greece we are pre&s;ented with the machi|nations of gods
and demigods, the adventures of heroes and giants, the ravages of mon&s;ters
and dragons, and all the potency of charms and enchantments. Man, plain
hi&s;torical man, &s;eems to have no &s;hare in the picture, and while the
reader wanders through the mo&s;t de|lightful &s;cenes the imagination can
offer, he is &s;carce once pre&s;ented with the actions of &s;uch a being as
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would be vain therefore, and be&s;ide the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to
give an hi&s;torical air to ac|counts which were never meant to be
tran&s;|mitted as true. Some writers indeed have la|boriou&s;ly undertaken to
&s;eparate the truth from the fable, and to give us an unbroken narra|tive from
the fir&s;t dawning of tradition to the di&s;play of undoubted hi&s;tory; they
have le|velled down all mythology to their own ap|prehen&s;ions, every fable is
made to look with an air of probability, in&s;tead of a golden fleece Ja&s;on
goes in pur&s;uit of a great trea&s;ure; in|&s;tead of de&s;troying a chimera,
Bellerophon reclaims a mountain; in&s;tead of an hydra, Hercules overcomes a
robber.</P>
<P>Thus the fanciful pictures of a &s;trong ima|gination are taught to
a&s;&s;ume a &s;erious &s;e|verity, <PB N="3" REF="6"> and tend to deceive the
reader &s;till more by offering in the garb of truth what had been only meant
to delight and allure him.</P>
<P>The fabulous age, therefore, of Greece mu&s;t have no place in
hi&s;tory; it is now too late to &s;eparate the&s;e parts which may have a real
foundation in nature from tho&s;e which owe their exi&s;tence wholly to the
imagination. There are no traces left to guide us in that intricate pur&s;uit,
the dews of the morning are pa&s;t, and it is vain to attempt continuing the
chace in meridian &s;plendor. It will be &s;uf|ficient therefore for us to
ob&s;erve, that Greece, like mo&s;t other countries of who&s;e origin we have
any notice, was at fir&s;t divided into a number of petty &s;tates, each
commanded by its own &s;overeign. Ancient Greece, which is now the &s;outh part
of Turkey in Europe, was bounded on the ea&s;t by the Egean &s;ea, now called
the Archipelago; on the &s;outh by the Cretan or Candian &s;ea; on the we&s;t
by the Ionian &s;ea; and on the north by Illyria and Thrace. Of &s;uch very
narrow extent, and &s;o very contemptible with regard to ter|ritory was that
country which gave birth to all the arts of war and peace, which pro|duced the
greate&s;t generals, philo&s;ophers, poets, painters, architects and
&s;tatuaries that the <PB N="4" REF="7"> world ever boa&s;ted, which overcame
the mo&s;t powerful monarchs, and di&s;per&s;ed the mo&s;t numerous armies that
ever were brought into the field, and at la&s;t became the in&s;tructor of all
mankind.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in &s;cripture that Javan, the &s;on of Japeth, was the
father of all the&s;e nations that went under the general denomination of
Greeks. Of his four &s;ons, Eli&s;ha, or Ellas is &s;aid to have given name to
the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, a ge|neral name by which the
Greeks were known. Thar&s;is, the &s;econd &s;on, is thought to have &s;ettled
in Achaia; Chittim &s;ettled in Macedo|nia; and Dodanim, the fourth, &s;on in
The&s;&s;aly and Epirus. How they portioned out the country, what revolutions
they experienced, or what wars they maintained are utterly un|known, and indeed
the hi&s;tory of petty bar|barous &s;tates, if known, would hardly re|compence
the trouble of enquiry. In tho&s;e early times, kingdoms were but
incon&s;ider|able: a &s;ingle city with a few leagues of land was often
honoured with that magnificent ap|pellation; it would therefore embarra&s;s
hi&s;tory to enter into the dome&s;tic privacy of every little &s;tate, as it
would be rather a &s;ubject for the oeconomi&s;t than the politician. It will
&s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that Sicyon is &s;aid to be the <PB N="5" REF="8">
mo&s;t ancient kingdom of Greece. The begin|ing of this petty &s;overeignty is
placed by hi&s;to|rians in the year of the world one thou&s;and nine hundred
and fifteen, before Je&s;us Chri&s;t two thou&s;and eighty-nine, and before the
fir&s;t Olympiad one thou&s;and three hundred and thirteen. The fir&s;t king
was Aegialeus. Its duration is &s;aid to have been a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Argos, in Pelopone&s;us, be|gan a thou&s;and and
eighty years before the fir&s;t Olympiad, in the time of Abraham. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2148.</NOTE> The fir&s;t king was
Inachus.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Mycaenae &s;ucceeded. The &s;eat of government was
tran&s;lated thither from Argos by Per&s;eus, the grand&s;on of Acri&s;ius, the
la&s;t king of that country, who Per&s;eus un|fortunately &s;lew. The kings who
reigned at Mycaenae after Per&s;eus, were Electryon, Sthe|nelus, and
Eury&s;theus; the latter of whom was driven out by the Heraclidae, or the
de&s;cen|dants of Hercules, who made them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of
Peloponne&s;us.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Athens was fir&s;t founded by Cecrops, an Egyptian. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2448.</NOTE> This prince hav|ing &s;ettled
in Attica, divided the whole country &s;ubject to him into twelve di&s;tricts,
and al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a court for judging cau&s;es, entitled 
<PB N="6" REF="9"> the Areopagus. Amphictyon, the third king of Athens,
procured a confederacy among the twelve &s;tates of Greece, which a&s;&s;embled
twice a year at Thermopylae, there to offer up common &s;acrifices, and to
con&s;ult for the common inte|re&s;t of the a&s;&s;ociation. The&s;eus, one of
the &s;ucceeding kings of this &s;tate, united the twelve boroughs of Cecrops
into one city. Codrus was the la&s;t of this line who devoted him&s;elf to
death for his people. The Heraclidae having made an irruption as far as the
gates of Athens, the oracle declared, that they &s;hould be con|querors who&s;e
king &s;hould fall in this conte&s;t. To take the earlie&s;t advantage,
therefore, of this an&s;wer, Codrus di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a
pea&s;ant, and provoking one of the enemies &s;oldiers, was killed by him.
Where|upon, the Athenians &s;ent an herald to demand the body of their king,
which me&s;&s;age &s;truck &s;uch a damp into the enemy, that they depart|ed
without &s;triking another blow. After Cod|rus the title of king was
extingui&s;hed among the Athenians. Medon, his &s;on, was &s;et at the head of
the commonwealth, with the title of Archon, which &s;ignifies chief governor.
The fir&s;t of this denomination had their places for life, but the Athenians
growing weary of a go|vernment which repre&s;t their love of freedom, 
<PB N="7" REF="10"> they abridged the terms of the archon's power to ten years,
and at la&s;t made the office elective every year.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Thebes was fir&s;t founded by Cadmus. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2549.</NOTE> This hero coming by &s;ea from
the coa&s;t of Phoenicia, &s;ettled in that part of the country which was
afterwards called Baeotia. He there built the city of Thebes, which from his
own name he called Cadmaea, and there fixed his &s;eat of power and dominion.
The adventures of his unhappy po&s;terity, Laius, Joca&s;ta, Oedipus, Eteocles,
and Polynices, make a &s;hining figure among the poetical fictions of that
period.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Sparta, or Lacedaemon, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be fir&s;t
in&s;tituted by Leliae. He|lena, the tenth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from this
monarch, is equally famous for her beauty and infidelity. She had not lived
above three years with her hu&s;band, Menelaus, before &s;he was carried off by
Paris, the &s;on of Priam king of Troy. This &s;eems to be the fir&s;t
occa&s;ion in which the Greeks united in one common cau&s;e. The Greeks took
Troy after a ten years &s;iege, much about the time that Jeptha was the judge
in I&s;rael.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2820.</NOTE> Corinth began later than the
other cities above-mentioned to be formed into a &s;tate, or <PB N="8" REF="11"> to be governed by its kings. It was at fir&s;t &s;ubject to Argos and
Mycaenae, but Si&s;iphus, the &s;on of Aeolus, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2628.</NOTE> and when his de&s;cendants were
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, Bachis a&s;&s;umed the reins of power. The government
after this became ari&s;tocratical, a chief magi|&s;trate being annually
cho&s;en by the name of Prytanni. At la&s;t Cyp&s;elus having gained the
people, u&s;urped the &s;upreme authority, which he tran&s;mitted to his &s;on
Periander, who was ranked among the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, from the love
he bore to learning, and his en|couragement of its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Macedonia was fir&s;t go|verned by Caranus,
de&s;cended from Hercules, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from his time till the defeat of
Per&s;eus by the Romans, a &s;pace of &s;ix hundred and twenty-&s;ix years.</P>
<P>Such is the picture Greece offers in its earlie&s;t infancy. A
combination of little &s;tates, each go|verned by its re&s;pective &s;overeign,
yet all uniting for their mutual &s;afety and general advantage. Still,
however, their inte&s;tine contentions were carried on with great animo&s;ity;
and, as it hap|pens in all petty &s;tates under the dominion of a &s;ingle
commander, the jealou&s;ies of the princes were a continual cau&s;e of
di&s;cord. From this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, tho&s;e &s;tates, 
<PB N="9" REF="12"> by degrees, began to emerge: a different &s;pirit began to
&s;eize the people, and, &s;ick of the contentions of their princes, they
de&s;ired to be free. A &s;pirit of liberty prevail|ed all over Greece, and a
general change of government was effected in every part of the country except
in Macedonia. Thus monar|chy gave way to a republican government, which,
however, was diver&s;ified into as many various forms as there were different
cities, according to the different genius and peculiar character of each
people.</P>
<P>All the&s;e cities, though &s;eemingly diffe|rent from each other in
their laws and in|tere&s;ts, were united with each other by one common
language, one religion, and a nation|al pride that taught them to con&s;ider
all other nations as barbarous and feeble. Even Egypt it&s;elf, from whence
they had derived many of their arts and in&s;titutions, was con&s;idered in a
very &s;ubordinate light, and rather as an half barbarous predece&s;&s;or, than
an enlightened rival.</P>
<P>To make this union among the &s;tates of Greece &s;till &s;tronger,
there were games in&s;ti|tuted in different parts of the country, with re|wards
for excellence in every pur&s;uit. The&s;e &s;ports were in&s;tituted for very
&s;erious and u&s;e|ful <PB N="10" REF="13"> purpo&s;es; they afforded an
opportunity for the &s;everal &s;tates meeting together; they gave them a
greater zeal for their common religion; they exerci&s;ed the youth for the
purpo&s;es of war, and increa&s;ed that vigour and activity which was then of
the utmo&s;t importance in de|ciding the fate of a battle.</P>
<P>But their chief bond of union aro&s;e from the council of the
Amphictyons, which was in&s;ti|tuted by Amphictyon, king of Athens, as is
al|ready mentioned, and was appointed to be held twice a year at Thermopylae,
to deliberate for the general good of tho&s;e &s;tates of who&s;e deputies it
was compo&s;ed. The &s;tates who &s;ent deputies to this council, were twelve,
namely, the The&s;&s;alians, the Thebans, the Dorians, the Ionians, the
Perhaabeans, the Magnates, the Locrians, the Oetans, the Pthiotes, the Maleans,
the Phocians, and the Dolopians. Each of tho&s;e cities which had a right to
a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Amphictyonic council, was obliged to &s;end two deputies to
every meeting. The one was intitled the Hieromnemon, who took care of the
intere&s;ts of religion; the other was called the Pylagoras, and had in charge
the civil intere&s;ts of his community. Each of the&s;e deputies, however,
differing in their functions, enjoyed an equal power of determining all
af|fairs <PB N="11" REF="14"> relative to the general intere&s;ts of Greece.
But, although the number of deputies &s;eems to have been &s;ettled originally
&s;o as to an&s;wer the number of votes which each city was allow|ed, yet in
proce&s;s of time, on &s;ome extraordi|nary occa&s;ions, the principal cities
a&s;&s;umed a power of &s;ending more than one Pylagoras to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a
critical emergency, or to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a faction. When the
deputies, thus appointed, appeared to execute their com|mi&s;&s;ion, after
offering up &s;acrifices to Apollo, Diana, Latona, and Minerva, they took an
oath, implying, that they would never &s;ubvert any city of the Amphictyons,
never &s;top the cour&s;e of waters either in war or peace, and that they would
oppo&s;e any attempts to le&s;&s;en the reverence and authority of the gods, to
whom they had paid their adoration. Thus, all offences again&s;t religion, all
in&s;tances of impiety and profanation, all conte&s;ts between the Grecian
&s;tates and cities came under the particular cognizance of the Amphictyons,
who had a right to determine, to impo&s;e fines, and even to levy forces, and
to make war again&s;t tho&s;e who offered to rebel again&s;t their &s;ove|reign
authority.</P>
<P>The&s;e different motives to confederacy unit|ed the Greeks for a
time into a body of great <PB N="12" REF="15"> power, and greater emulation. By
this a&s;&s;ocia|tion, a country not half &s;o large as England, was able to
di&s;pute the empire of the earth with the mo&s;t powerful monarchs of the
world. By this a&s;&s;ociation, they not only made head again&s;t the numerous
armies of Per&s;ia, but di&s;|per&s;ed, routed and de&s;troyed them, reducing
their pride &s;o low, as to make them &s;ubmit to conditions of peace as
&s;hameful to the con|quered as glorious to the conquerors. But among all the
cities of Greece, there were two that by their merit, their valour, and their
wi&s;dom, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the re&s;t: the&s;e
were Athens and Lace|daemon. As the&s;e cities &s;erved as an example of
bravery or learning to the re&s;t, and as the chief burthen of every foreign
war devolved upon them, it will be proper to enter into their particular
hi&s;tory with greater minutene&s;s, and to give the reader &s;ome idea of the
genius, character, manners, and government of their re&s;pective
inhabitants.</P>

<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Government of SPARTA, and the Laws of
LYCURGUS.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the kingdom of Lacedae|mon was not &s;o con&s;iderable as
that of Athens, yet as it was of much earlier in&s;titution, it de|mands our
fir&s;t attention. Lacedaemon, as ob&s;erved above, was in the beginning
govern|ed by kings, of which thirteen held the reins of power in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of the race of the Pe|lopidae. As during this dark interval
there were no fixed laws to limit the prerogative, nor no ideas of true
government among the people, it does not appear that there were any
con&s;iderable encroachments made either on the &s;ide of the king or that of
the people. Under the race of the Heraclidae, who &s;ucceeded, in|&s;tead of
one king, the people admitted two, who governed with equal authority. The
cau&s;e of this change &s;eems to have &s;prung from a very particular
accident; for Ari&s;todemus dying, left two &s;ons, Eury&s;thenes and Procles,
twins, &s;o much alike, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;|tingui&s;h 
<PB N="14" REF="17"> them a&s;under. From hence the hint was taken by the
mother of fixing the crown upon both; &s;o that when the Spartans came for a
king, &s;he was either unwilling or un|able to decide which of them was
fir&s;t-born, or which had the ju&s;te&s;t preten&s;ions. This form of
government continued for &s;everal &s;uc|ceeding centuries, and though the one
was almo&s;t ever at variance with his a&s;&s;ociate on the throne, yet the
government remained en|tire.</P>
<P>It was during this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that &s;lavery was fir&s;t
in&s;tituted in Sparta. Ery&s;thenes and Procles having granted the countrymen
of Sparta the &s;ame privileges with the citizens, Agis rever&s;ed what his
predece&s;&s;ors had done in favour of the pea&s;ants, and impo&s;ed a tri|bute
upon them. The Helotes were the only people that would not acquie&s;ce in this
im|po&s;t, but ro&s;e in rebellion to vindicate their rights: the citizens
however prevailed, the Helotes were &s;ubdued and made pri&s;oners of war. As a
&s;till greater puni&s;hment, they and their po&s;terity were condemned to
perpetual &s;lavery; and, to encrea&s;e their mi&s;eries &s;till more, all
other &s;laves were called by the ge|neral name of Helotes.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"> It would appear from hence that this little
&s;tate was governed with turbulence and op|pre&s;&s;ion, and required the curb
of &s;evere laws and rigorous di&s;cipline. The&s;e &s;everities and ri|gorous
di&s;cipline were at la&s;t impo&s;ed upon it by Lycurgus, one of the fir&s;t
and mo&s;t ex|traordinary legi&s;lators that ever appeared among mankind. There
is perhaps nothing more remarkable in prophane hi&s;tory, yet nothing &s;o well
atte&s;ted, as what relates to the laws and government of Lycurgus. What indeed
can be more amazing than to behold a mutinous and &s;avage race of mankind
yield|ing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to laws that controuled every &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure
and every private affection; to behold them give up, for the good of the
&s;tate, all the comforts and conveniencies of private life, and making a
&s;tate of dome&s;tic privacy more &s;evere and terrible than the mo&s;t
painful campaigns and the mo&s;t warlike du|ties. Yet all this was effected by
the per&s;e|verance and authority of a &s;ingle legi&s;lator, who gave the
fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons of hard re&s;ignation in his own generous example.</P>
<P>Lycurgus was the &s;on of Eunomus, one of the two kings who reigned
together in Sparta. The two kings dying without apparent i&s;&s;ue, the right
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion re&s;ted in Lycurgus, <PB N="16" REF="19"> who accordingly
took the admini&s;tration upon him. But an unexpected event came to in|terrupt
his promotion; for the queen his &s;i&s;ter-in-law proving with child, his
right became doubtful. A man of le&s;s probity would have u&s;ed every
precaution to &s;ecure him&s;elf upon the throne, and a propo&s;al which was
made him by the queen &s;eemed to &s;ecure his pre|ten&s;ions. She offered to
de&s;troy the birth, upon condition that he would marry her, and take her into
a &s;hare of power. Lycurgus wi&s;ely &s;mothered his re&s;entment at &s;o
unnatural a propo&s;al, and fearful that &s;he might u&s;e means to put her
project in execution, a&s;&s;ured her that as &s;oon as the child was born he
would take upon him&s;elf to remove it out of the way. Accordingly &s;he was
delivered of a boy, which Lycurgus commanded &s;hould be brought to him, as he
was at &s;upper with the magi&s;trates; to them he pre&s;ented the child as
their king, and to te&s;tify his own and the people's joy, gave him the name of
Charilaus. Thus Lycurgus &s;acrificed his ambition to his duty; and &s;till
more, continued his regency, not as king but governor. However, dread|ing the
re&s;entment of the queen, and finding the &s;tate in great di&s;order, he
re&s;olved by travelling to avoid the dangers of the one, <PB N="17" REF="20">
and to procure a remedy for the defects of the other.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olving to make him&s;elf acquainted with all the
improvements of other nations, and to con&s;ult the mo&s;t experienced
per&s;ons he could meet with in the art of government, he began with the
i&s;land of Crete, who&s;e hard and &s;evere laws were very much admired. In
this i&s;land the handicraft trades were brought to &s;ome degree of
perfection. There they wrought in copper and iron, and made ar|mour, in which
they danced with a confu&s;ed noi&s;e of bells at the &s;acrifices of their
gods. It was from them that the art of navigation was fir&s;t known in Greece,
and from them many legi&s;lators derived the principles of their re&s;pective
in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>From Crete Lycurgus pa&s;&s;ed over into A&s;ia, where he &s;till
found new information, and is &s;aid to have fir&s;t made the di&s;covery of
the works of Homer. From thence he went into Egypt, and is &s;aid by &s;ome to
have had con|&s;erences with the gymno&s;ophi&s;ts of India. But whil&s;t thus
employed abroad, his pre&s;ence be|gan to be greatly wanted at home. All
par|ties con&s;pired to wi&s;h his coming, and many me&s;&s;ages were &s;ent to
ha&s;ten his return. The kings them&s;elves importuned him to that effect, 
<PB N="18" REF="21"> and let him know, that the people were arriv|ed at &s;uch
a pitch of di&s;order that nothing but his authority could controul their
licentiou&s;ne&s;s. In fact, every thing tended to the unavoidable
de&s;truction of the &s;tate, and nothing but his pre&s;ence was wi&s;hed to
check its encrea&s;ing di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Lycurgus, at length per&s;uaded to return, found the people wearied
out with their own importunities, and ready to receive any new impre&s;&s;ions
he might attempt. Wherefore the corruption being general, he found it
nece&s;&s;ary to change the whole form of the government; &s;en&s;ible that a
few particular laws would pro|duce no great effect. But con&s;idering the
ef|ficacy of religion in promoting every new in&s;ti|tution, he went fir&s;t to
con&s;ult the oracle of Apollo at Delphos, where he met a reception that might
flatter his highe&s;t ambition, for he was &s;aluted by the prie&s;tle&s;s as a
friend of the gods, and rather as a god than man. As to his new in&s;titution
al&s;o, he was told that the gods heard his prayers, and that the common|wealth
he was going to e&s;tabli&s;h would be the mo&s;t excellent and durable upon
earth.</P>
<P>Thus encouraged, on his return to Sparta, Lycurgus fir&s;t
communicated his de&s;igns to his particular friends, and then by degrees
gain|ed <PB N="19" REF="22"> over the leading men to his party, until things
being ripe for a change, he ordered thirty of the principal men to appear armed
in the market-place. Charilaus, who was at that time king, &s;eemed at fir&s;t
willing to oppo&s;e this revolution, but being intimidated by a &s;u|perlor
force, he took &s;helter in the temple of Minerva; where, being prevailed upon
by his &s;ubjects, and being al&s;o of a flexible temper, he came forth and
joined the confederacy. The people &s;oon acquie&s;ced under a &s;et of
in&s;ti|tutions which were evidently calulated for their improvement, and
gladly acknowledged &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to laws which leaned with equal weight
upon every rank of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To continue the KINGS &s;till with a &s;hadow of power, he confirmed
them in their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as before, but dimini&s;hed their
autho|rity by in&s;tituting a &s;enate, which was to &s;erve as a
counterpoi&s;e between the prerogative and the people. They &s;till, however,
had all their former marks of outward dignity and re&s;pect. They had the chief
&s;eats in every public a&s;&s;em|bly; in voting they were allowed fir&s;t to
give their opinion; they received amba&s;&s;adors and &s;trangers, and
overlooked public buildings and highways. In the field they were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of greater power, they conducted the armies 
<PB N="20" REF="23"> of the &s;tate, and were attended by judges,
field-deputies, and a general of the hor&s;e. However, they were not entirely
at liberty even in war, as they received their orders from the &s;enate, which,
though for the mo&s;t part di&s;cretionary, yet they were &s;ometimes forced to
march again&s;t the enemy, or to return home when they lea&s;t de&s;ired to
retreat.</P>
<P>The government hitherto had been un|&s;teady, tending at one time
time towards de&s;po|ti&s;m, at another to democracy, but the SENATE
in&s;tituted by Lycurgus &s;erved as a check upon both, and kept the &s;tate
balanced in tranquility. This body, which was compo&s;ed of twenty-eight
members, founded their chief policy in &s;iding with the kings when the people
were gra&s;ping at too much power; and, on the other hand, in e&s;pou&s;ing the
intere&s;ts of the people whenever the kings attempted to carry their authority
too far. The &s;enators, who were compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted
Lycurgus in his de&s;igns, as well as of &s;everal of the ci|tizens remarkable
for their private virtues, but none were eligible till &s;ixty years of age.
They were continued for life, except upon any noto|rious crime; and this, as it
prevented the in|conveniencies of too frequent a change, &s;o it was a
la&s;ting reward to the old, and a noble <PB N="21" REF="24"> incentive to the
young. The&s;e formed the &s;upreme court of judicature; and though there lay
an appeal from them to the people, yet as they were only convened at the
plea&s;ure of the &s;enate, and as the &s;enators were not re&s;pon&s;ible for
any wrong judgment, their decrees general|ly pa&s;t without a repeal. Indeed,
for &s;everal ages, &s;uch was the caution, and &s;uch the in|tegrity of this
tribunal, that none &s;eemed de|&s;irous of &s;eeking farther ju&s;tice, and
both par|ties acquie&s;ced in the ju&s;tice of their decree. However, the great
power which the &s;enate was thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, was about a century
after tempered by the erection of a &s;uperior court, called the court of the
EPHORI, which con&s;i&s;ted of but five in number, and the members were
cho&s;en annually into their o&s;fice. They were elected from the people, and
had a power of ar|re&s;ting and impri&s;oning even the per&s;ons of their
kings, if they acted unbecoming their &s;tation.</P>
<P>The PEOPLE al&s;o had a nominal &s;hare in the government. They had
their a&s;&s;emblies con|&s;i&s;ting of citizens only, and al&s;o their great
con|vention of all per&s;ons who were free of the &s;tate. But this power of
convening was but a mere mat|ter of form, as the &s;enate alone was permitted
to call them together, and as it was in the option of that body to di&s;mi&s;s
them at plea&s;ure. The <PB N="22" REF="25"> &s;ubject of deliberation al&s;o
was to be of their propo&s;al, while the people, denied the privilege of
debating or di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, could only reject or ratify with laconic
deci&s;ion. To keep them &s;till more helple&s;s, they were left out of all
of|fices of the &s;tate, and were con&s;idered merely as machines, which their
wi&s;er fellow-citizens were to conduct and employ.</P>
<P>So &s;mall a degree of power granted to the people might be apt to
de&s;troy the&s;e in&s;titutions in their infancy, but to reconcile them to the
change, Lycurgus boldly re&s;olved to give them a &s;hare in tho&s;e lands from
whence, by the encrea&s;ing riches of &s;ome, and the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of
others, they had been deprived. To keep the people in plenty and dependence,
&s;eems to have been one of the mo&s;t refined &s;trokes in this
philo&s;opher's legi&s;lation. The generality or the people were at that time
&s;o poor, that they were de&s;titute of every kind of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
whil&s;t a &s;mall number of indivi|duals were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the
lands and the wealth of the country. In order, therefore, to bani&s;h the
in&s;olence, the &s;raud, and the luxury of the one, as well as the mi&s;ery,
the repining, and the factious de&s;pair of the others, he per&s;uaded the
majority, and forced the re&s;t to give up all their lands to the commonwealth,
<PB N="23" REF="26"> and to make a new divi&s;ion of them that they might all
live together in perfect equality. Thus all the &s;en&s;ual goods of life were
equally di&s;tributed among the governors and the go|verned, and &s;uperior
merit alone conferred &s;u|perior di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Lycurgus accordingly divided all the lands of Laconia into thirty
thou&s;and parts, and tho&s;e of Sparta into nine thou&s;and, and the&s;e he
portioned out to the re&s;pective inhabitants of each di&s;trict. Each portion
was &s;ufficient to maintain a family in that frugal manner he pro|po&s;ed;
and, though the kings had a larger &s;hare a&s;&s;igned them to &s;upport their
dignity, yet their tables had rather an air of decency and competency, than of
&s;uperfluity or pro|fu&s;ion. It is &s;aid that &s;ome years after, as
Ly|curgus was returning from a long journey, ob|&s;erving how equally the corn
was divided in all parts of the country, he was heard to ob|&s;erve &s;miling
on tho&s;e next him, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Does not La|conia look like an e&s;tate which
&s;everal brothers have been dividing among&s;t them?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But it would have an&s;wered no permanent purpo&s;e to divide the
lands, if the money were &s;till &s;uffered to accumulate. To prevent,
therefore, all other di&s;tinction but that of me|rit, he re&s;olved to level
down all fortune to <PB N="24" REF="27"> one &s;tandard. He did not indeed
&s;trip tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold or &s;ilver of their property; but,
what was equivalent, he cried down its value, and &s;uffered nothing but iron
money to pa&s;s in exchange for every commodity. This coin al&s;o he made &s;o
heavy, and fixed at &s;o low a rate, that a cart and two oxen were re|quired to
carry home a &s;um of ten minas, or about twenty pounds Engli&s;h, and a whole
hou&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to keep it in. This iron money had no currency among
any other of the Grecian &s;tates, who, &s;o far from e&s;teeming it, treated
it with the utmo&s;t contempt and ridi|cule. From the neglect of foreigners,
the Spartans them&s;elves began to de&s;pi&s;e it &s;o, that money was at
la&s;t brought into di&s;u&s;e, and few troubled them&s;elves with more than
was barely &s;ufficient to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities. Thus not only
riches, but their attendant train of avarice, fraud, rapine, and luxury, were
bani&s;hed from this &s;imple &s;tate, and the people found in ignorance of
riches a happy &s;ub&s;titute for the want of tho&s;e refinements they
be|&s;tow.</P>
<P>But the&s;e in&s;titutions were not thought &s;uf|ficient to prevent
that tendency which man|kind have to private exce&s;s. A third regula|tion was
therefore made, commanding that all <PB N="25" REF="28"> meals &s;hould be in
public. He ordained that all the men &s;hould eat in one common hall without
di&s;tinction; and le&s;t &s;trangers &s;hould attempt to corrupt his citizens
by their ex|ample, a law was expre&s;sly made again&s;t their continuance in
the city. By the&s;e means fru|gality was not only made nece&s;&s;ary, but the
u&s;e of riches was at once aboli&s;hed. Every man &s;ent monthly his
provi&s;ions to the com|mon &s;tock, with a little money for other con|tingent
expences. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of one bu|&s;hel of flour, eight mea&s;ures of
wine, five pounds of chee&s;e, and two pounds and an half of figs. The tables
con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen per&s;ons each, where none could be admitted but by
the con&s;ent of the whole company. Every one without exception of per&s;ons
was obliged to be at the common meal; and a long time af|ter, when Agis
returned from a &s;ucce&s;sful ex|pedition, he was puni&s;hed and reprimanded
for having eaten with his queen in private. The very children eat at the&s;e
meals, and were car|ried thither as to a &s;chool of temperance and wi&s;dom.
At the&s;e homely repa&s;ts no rude or immoral conver&s;ation was permitted, no
lo|quacious di&s;putes or o&s;tentatious talking. Each endeavoured to expre&s;s
his &s;entiments with the utmo&s;t per&s;picuity and conci&s;ene&s;s; wit was 
<PB N="26" REF="29"> admitted to &s;ea&s;on the banquet, and &s;e|crecy to give
it &s;ecurity. As &s;oon as a young man came into the room, the olde&s;t man in
the company u&s;ed to &s;ay to him, point|ing to the door, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Nothing &s;poken here mu&s;t go that
way.</HI></Q> Black broth was their favourite di&s;h, of what ingredients it
was made is now known, but they u&s;ed no fle&s;h in their entertainments; it
probably re&s;embled tho&s;e lenten &s;oups which are &s;till in u&s;e on the
con|tinent. Diony&s;ius, the tyrant, found their fare very unpalatable; but, as
the cook a&s;&s;erted, the broth was nothing without the &s;ea&s;oning of
fa|tigue and hunger.</P>
<P>An injunction &s;o rigorous, which thus cut off all the delicacies
and refinements of luxury, was by no means plea&s;ing to the rich, who took
every occa&s;ion to in&s;ult the lawgiver upon his new regulations. The tumults
it excited were frequent; and in one of the&s;e, a young fellow who&s;e name
was Alexander, &s;truck out one of Lycurgus's eyes. But he had the ma|jority of
the people on his &s;ide, who, provok|ed at the outrage, delivered the young
man in|to his hands to treat him with all proper &s;e|verity. Lycurgus,
in&s;tead of te&s;tifying any brutal re&s;entment, won over his aggre&s;&s;or
by all the arts of affability and tenderne&s;s, till, at <PB N="27" REF="30">
la&s;t, from being one of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t turbulent men of Sparta, he
became an ex|ample of wi&s;dom and moderation, and an u&s;e|ful a&s;&s;i&s;tant
to Lycurgus in promoting his new in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Thus, undaunted by oppo&s;ition, and &s;teady in his de&s;igns, he
went on to make a thorough reformation in the manners of his countrymen. As the
education of youth was one of the mo&s;t important objects of a legi&s;lator's
care, he took care to in&s;til &s;uch early principles, that children &s;hould
in a manner be born with a &s;en&s;e of or|der and di&s;cipline. His grand
principle was, that children were properly the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
&s;tate, and belonged to the community more than to their parents. To this end
he began from the very time of their conception, making it the mother's duty to
u&s;e &s;uch diet and exerci&s;e as might fit her to produce a vigo|rous and
healthy offspring. As during this pe|riod, all in&s;titutions were tinctured
with the &s;avagene&s;s of the times, it is not wonderful that Lycurgus
ordained that all &s;uch children as, upon a public view, were deemed deformed
or weakly, and unfitted for a future life of vi|gour and fatigue, &s;hould be
expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in a cavern near mount Taygetus. This was con&s;idered as
a public puni&s;hment upon the <PB N="28" REF="31"> mother, and it was thought
the readie&s;t way to lighten the &s;tate of a future encumbrance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e infants that were born without any ca|pital defects were
adopted as children of the &s;tate, and delivered to their parents to be
nur&s;|ed with &s;everity and hard&s;hip. From their tendere&s;t age they were
accu&s;tomed to make no choice in their eating, not to be afraid in the dark,
or when left alone, not to be peevi&s;h or fretful, to walk barefoot, to lie
hard at nights, to wear the &s;ame cloaths winter and &s;ummer, and to fear
nothing from their equals. At the age of &s;even years they were taken from
their parents, and delivered over to the cla&s;&s;es for a public education.
Their di&s;cipline there was little el&s;e than an apprentice&s;hip to
hard|&s;hip, &s;elf-denial, and obedience. In the&s;e cla&s;&s;es one of the
boys more advanced and ex|perienced than the re&s;t, pre&s;ided as captain to
govern and cha&s;ti&s;e the refractory. Their very &s;ports and exerci&s;es
were regulated according to the exacte&s;t di&s;cipline, and made up of labour
and fatigue. They went barefoot, with their heads &s;haved, and fought with one
another naked. While they were at table it was u&s;ual for the ma&s;ters to
in&s;truct the boys, by a&s;king them que&s;tions concerning the nature of
moral actions, or the different merits of the mo&s;t not|ed <PB N="29" REF="32"> men of the time. The boys were obliged to give a quick and ready
an&s;wer, which was to be accompanied with his rea&s;ons in the con|ci&s;e&s;t
manner, for a Spartan's language was as &s;paring as his money was ponderous
and bulky. All o&s;tentatious learning was bani&s;hed from this &s;imple
commonwealth, their only &s;tudy was to obey, their only pride was to &s;uffer
hard&s;hip. Every art was practi&s;ed to harden them again&s;t adventitious
danger. There was yearly a cu&s;tom of whipping them at the altar of Diana, and
the boy that bore this puni&s;h|ment with the greate&s;t fortitude came off
victo|rious. This was inflicted publicly before the eyes of their parents, and
in the pre&s;ence of the whole city; and many were known to ex|pire under the
&s;everity of the di&s;cipline without uttering a &s;ingle groan. Even their
own fa|thers, when they &s;aw them covered with blood and wounds, and ready to
expire, exhorted them to per&s;evere to the end with con&s;tancy and
re&s;olution. Plutarch, who &s;ays that he has &s;een &s;everal children expire
under this cruel treatment, tells us of one who having &s;tolen a fox, and hid
it under his coat, cho&s;e rather to let it tear out his very bowels than
di&s;cover the theft.</P>
<P>Every in&s;titution &s;eemed tending to harden the body and
&s;harpen the mind for war. In <PB N="30" REF="33"> order to prepare them for
&s;tratagems and &s;ud|den incur&s;ions, the boys were permitted to &s;teal
from each other, but if they were caught in the fact, they were puni&s;hed for
their want of dexterity. Such a permi&s;&s;ion, therefore, was little better
than a prohibition of theft, &s;ince the puni&s;hment followed, as at
pre&s;ent, in ca&s;e of detection. In fact, by this in&s;titution, negligence
in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was made ju&s;tly liable to the lo&s;s of his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, a con&s;ide|ration which has not been &s;ufficiently
attended to by &s;ub&s;equent legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>At twelve years old the boys were removed into other cla&s;s of a
more advanced kind. There, in order to cru&s;h the &s;eeds of vice, which at
that time began to appear, their labour and di&s;cipline were encrea&s;ed with
their age. There they had their in&s;tructor from among the men called
Paedonomus, and under him the Irens, young men &s;elected from their own body,
to exerci&s;e a more con&s;tant and imme|diate command over them. They had now
their &s;kirmi&s;hes between parties, and their mock fights between larger
bodies. In the&s;e they often fought with hands, feet, teeth, and nails, with
&s;uch ob&s;tinacy that it was common to &s;ee them loo&s;e their eyes, and
often their lives before the fray was determined. Such was the con&s;tant 
<PB N="31" REF="34"> di&s;cipline of their minority, which la&s;ted till the
age of thirty, before which they were not permitted to marry, to go into the
troops, or to bear any office in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>With regard to the virgins, their di&s;cipline was equally &s;trict
with the former. They were inured to a con&s;tant cour&s;e of labour and
indu&s;try until they were twenty years old, be|fore which time they were not
allowed to be marriageable. They al&s;o had their peculiar exerci&s;es. They
ran, wre&s;tled, pitched the bar, and performed all the&s;e feats naked before
the whole body of the citizens. Yet this was thought no way indecent, as it was
&s;uppo&s;ed that the frequent view of the per&s;on would rather check than
excite every loo&s;er appetite. An education &s;o manlike did not fail to
pro|duce in the Spartan women corre&s;ponding &s;en|timents. They were bold,
frugal, and pa|triotic, filled with a &s;en&s;e of honour, and a love of
military glory. Some foreign women in conver&s;ation with the wife of Leonidas
&s;ay|ing, that the Spartan women alone knew how to govern the men, &s;he
boldly replied, the Spartan women alone bring forth men. A mother was known to
give her &s;on, who was going to battle, his &s;hield, with this remarkable
advice; 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Return with it,</HI> or <HI>return upon
it.</HI></Q> Im|plying, <PB N="32" REF="35"> that rather than throw it from him
in flight, he &s;hould be borne upon it dead to his friends in Sparta. Another
hearing that her &s;on was killed fighting for his country, &s;he an&s;wered
without any emotion, it was for that I brought him into the world. After the
battle of Leuctra, the parents of tho&s;e who died in the action, went to the
temples to thank the gods that their &s;ons had done their duty, while tho&s;e
who&s;e children &s;urvived that dreadful day &s;eem|ed incon&s;oleable.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t not be concealed, that in a city where the women were
in&s;pired with &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for military glory, they were not equal|ly
remarkable for connubial fidelity. In fact, there was no law again&s;t
adultery, and an ex|change of hu&s;bands was often actually practi&s;ed among
them. This was always indeed by the mutual con&s;ent of parties, which removed
the tedious ceremonies of a divorce. One rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for allowing
this mutual liberty, was not &s;o much to gratify licentious de&s;ire, as to
improve the breed of citizens, by matching &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
mutual inclination. In fact, in many of the laws of Lycurgus he &s;eems to
admit, that private vices may become public benefits, and this among the
number.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"> Be&s;ides the&s;e con&s;titutional
re&s;olutions, there were many other general maxims laid down that obtained the
force of laws among them. They were forbid to exerci&s;e any mechanic art. The
chief occupation of the Spartans was bodily exerci&s;es or hunting. The Helotes
who had lo&s;t their liberty &s;ome centuries be|fore, and who had been
condemned to per|petual &s;lavery, tilled their lands for them, receiving for
their labour a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The citizens thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
competence and lei&s;ure, were mo&s;tly in company in their large common halls,
where they met and conver&s;ed together. They pa&s;&s;ed little of their time
alone, being accu&s;tomed to live like bees, always together, always attentive
to their chiefs and leaders. The love of their country and the public good was
their predominant pa&s;|&s;ion, and all &s;elf-intere&s;t was lo&s;t in the
gene|ral wi&s;h for the welfare of the community. Pedarctus having mi&s;&s;ed
the honour of being cho&s;en one of the three hundred who had a certain rank in
the city, converted his di&s;ap|pointment into joy, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>that there were three hun|dred better men in
Sparta than he.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Among the maxims of this legi&s;lator, it was forbidden them to make
frequent war upon the &s;ame enemies. By this inhibition they were 
<PB N="34" REF="37"> re&s;trained from la&s;ting and immoderate re|&s;entment,
they were in no danger of teaching their di&s;cipline to tho&s;e they made war
upon, and all their alliances were thus more frequent|ly renewed.</P>
<P>Whenever they had broken and routed their enemies, they never
pur&s;ued them farther than was nece&s;&s;ary to make them&s;elves &s;ure of
the victory. They thought it &s;ufficiently glo|rious to overcome, and were
a&s;hamed of de|&s;troying an enemy that yielded or fled. Nor was this without
an&s;wering &s;ome good pur|po&s;es; for the enemy, con&s;cious that all who
re|&s;i&s;ted were put to the &s;word, often fled, as they were convinced that
&s;uch a conduct was the &s;ure&s;t means of obtaining &s;afety. Thus valour
and genero&s;ity &s;eemed the ruling motives of this new in&s;titution; arms
were their only exerci&s;e and employment, and their life was much le&s;s
au&s;tere in the camp than the city. The Spartans were the only people in the
world to whom the time of war was a time of ea&s;e and refre&s;hment, becau&s;e
then the &s;everity of their manners was relaxed, and the men were indulged in
greater liberties. With them the fir&s;t and mo&s;t inviolable law of war was
never to turn their backs on the enemy, however di&s;proportioned in forces,
nor to de|liver <PB N="35" REF="38"> up their arms until they re&s;igned them
with life. When the poet Archilochus came to Sparta, he was obliged to quit the
city for having a&s;&s;erted in one of his poems that it was better for a man
to lo&s;e his arms than his life. Thus re&s;olved upon conque&s;t or death,
they went calmly forward with all the confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ure of
meeting a glorious victory, or what they valued equally, a noble death.</P>
<P>Thus depending upon their valour alone for &s;afety, their
legi&s;lator forbid walling the city. It was his maxim that a wall of men was
pre|ferable to a wall of brick, and that confined valour was &s;carce
preferable to cowardice. Indeed a city, in which were thirty thou&s;and
fighting men, &s;tood in little need of walls to pro|tect it; and we have
&s;carce an in&s;tance in hi&s;|tory of their &s;uffering them&s;elves to be
driven to their la&s;t retreats. War and its honours was their employment and
ambition; their Helotes, or &s;laves, tilled their grounds, and did all their
&s;ervile drudgery. The&s;e unhappy men were in a manner bound to the &s;oil,
it was not lawful to &s;ell them to &s;trangers, or to make them free. If at
any time their increa&s;e be|came inconvenient, or created a &s;u&s;picion in
their fierce ma&s;ters, there was a <HI>cryptia,</HI> or <HI>&s;e|cret
act,</HI> by which they were permitted to de|&s;tory <PB N="36" REF="39"> them.
From this barbarous &s;everity, however, Lycurgus is aquitted by Plutarch, but
it is plain, that his in&s;titutions were not &s;ufficient to re&s;train the
people from &s;uch ba&s;e|ne&s;s and cruelty. It was by this act allowed for
&s;everal companies of young men to go out of the city by day, and concealing
them&s;elves in the thickets, to ru&s;h out in the night upon their &s;laves,
and kill all they could find in their way. Thucydides relates, that two
thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;laves di&s;appeared at once without ever after being
heard of. It is truly amazing, how a people like the Spartans, renowned for
lenity to the conquered, for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;u|periors, for
reverence to old age, and friend|&s;hip for each other, &s;hould yet be &s;o
very bru|tal to tho&s;e beneath them; to men that ought to be con&s;idered in
every re&s;pect as their equals, as their countrymen, and only degraded by an
unju&s;t u&s;urpation. Yet nothing is more certain than their cruel treatment;
they were not only condemned to the mo&s;t &s;ervile occu|pations, but often
de&s;troyed without rea&s;on. They were frequently made drunk and expo&s;ed
before the children, in order to deter them from &s;o brutal a &s;pecies of
debauchery.</P>
<P>Such was the general purport of the in&s;titu|tions of Lycurgus,
which from their tendency <PB N="37" REF="40"> gained the e&s;teem and
admiration of all the &s;urrounding nations. The Greeks were ever apt to be
dazzled rather with &s;plendid than u&s;e|ful virtues, and prai&s;ed the laws
of Lycurgus, which at be&s;t were calculated rather to make men warlike than
happy, and to &s;ub&s;titute in|&s;en&s;ibility to enjoyment. If con&s;idered
in a political light, the city of Lacedaemon was but a military garri&s;on,
&s;upported by the la|bour of a numerous pea&s;antry that were &s;laves. The
laws, therefore, by which they were go|verned, are not much more rigorous than
many of the military in&s;titutions of modern princes, the &s;ame labour, the
&s;ame di&s;cipline, the &s;ame poverty, and the &s;ame &s;ubordination, is
found in many of the garri&s;oned towns of Europe that prevailed for &s;o many
centuries in Sparta. The only difference that appears to me between a &s;oldier
of Lacedaemon, and a &s;oldier in garri&s;on at Gravelin, is, that the one was
permitted to marry at thirty, and the other is obliged to continue &s;ingle all
his life; the one lives in the mid&s;t of a civilized country, which he is
&s;uppo&s;ed to protect, the other liv|ed in the mid&s;t of a number of
civilized &s;tates, which he had no inclination to offend. War is equally the
trade of both, and a campaign is frequently a relaxation from the more rigorous
con&s;inement of garri&s;on duty.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41"> When Lycurgus had thus completed his military
in&s;titution, and when the form of go|vernment he had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eemed
&s;trong and vigorous enough to &s;upport it&s;elf, his next care was to give
it all the permanence in his power. He, therefore, &s;ignified to the people
that &s;omething &s;till remained for the comple|tion of his plan, and that he
was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of going to con&s;ult the oracle at Delphos for its
advice. In the mean time, he per&s;uad|ed them to take an oath for the &s;trict
ob&s;ervance of all his laws till his return, and then depart|ed with a full
re&s;olution of never &s;eeing Sparta more. When he was arrived at Delphos, he
con&s;ulted the oracle to know whether the laws he had made were &s;ufficient
to render the La|cedaemonians happy; and being an&s;wered that nothing was
wanting to their perfection, he &s;ent this an&s;wer to Sparta, and then
voluntari|ly &s;tarved him&s;elf to death. Others &s;ay, that he died in Crete,
ordering his body to be burnt, and his a&s;hes to be thrown into the &s;ea. The
death of this great lawgiver gave a &s;anc|tion and authority to his laws which
his life was unable to confer. The Spartans regarded his end as the mo&s;t
glorious of all his actions, and a noble fini&s;hing of all his former
&s;ervices; they con&s;idered them&s;elves as bound by every tie of gratitude
and religion to a &s;trict ob&s;erv|ance <PB N="39" REF="42"> of all his
in&s;titutions; and the long continuance of the Spartan government is a proof
of their per&s;evering re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The city of Lacedaemon thus in&s;tituted, &s;eem|ed only de&s;irous
of an opportunity of di&s;play|ing the &s;uperiority of their power among the
neighbouring &s;tates, their rivals. The war between them and the
Me&s;&s;enians &s;oon taught them to know the advantages of their military
in&s;titution; but as I am ha&s;tening to more im|portant events, I will touch
upon this as con|ci&s;ely as I can. There was a temple of Diana common to the
Me&s;&s;enians and Lacedaemonians, &s;tanding upon the borders of either
kingdom. It was there that the Me&s;&s;enians were accu&s;ed of attempting the
cha&s;tity of &s;ome Spartan virgins, and of killing Teleclus, one of the
Spartan kings, who interpo&s;ed in their defence. The Me&s;&s;enians, on the
other hand, denied the charge, and averred, that the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed vir|gins
were young men thus dre&s;&s;ed up with daggers under their cloaths, and placed
there by Teleclus with an intent to &s;urpri&s;e them. To the mutual
re&s;entment occa&s;ioned by this, another cau&s;e of animo&s;ity was &s;oon
after added: Polychares, a Me&s;&s;enian, who had won the prize in the Olympic
games, let out &s;ome cows to pa&s;ture to Euphaenus, a Lacedae|monian, 
<PB N="40" REF="43"> who was to pay him&s;elf for their keep|ing with a &s;hare
of the increa&s;e. Euphaenus &s;old the cows, and pretended they were &s;tolen
from him. Polychares &s;ent his &s;on to demand the money; but the
Lacedaemonian, to aggra|vate his crime, killed the young man, and per&s;uaded
his countrymen to give no redre&s;s. Polychares, therefore, undertook to do
him|&s;elf ju&s;tice, and killed all the Lacedaemonians that came in his way.
Expo&s;tulations pa&s;&s;ed between both kingdoms, till at la&s;t the affair
came to a general war, which was carried on for many years with doubtful
&s;ucce&s;s. In this &s;ituation the Me&s;&s;enians &s;ent to con&s;ult the
oracle of Delphos, who required the &s;acrifice of a virgin of the family of
Aepytus. Upon ca&s;ting lots among the de&s;cendants of this prince, the chance
fell upon the daughter of Lyci&s;cus, but being thought to be
&s;uppo&s;iti|tious, Ari&s;todemus offered his daughter, whom all allowed to be
his own. Her lover, how|ever, attempted to avert the blow, by a&s;&s;ert|ing,
that &s;he was with child by him, but her father was &s;o enraged, that he
ripped up her belly with his own hand publicly to vindicate her innocence. The
enthu&s;ia&s;m which this &s;a|crifice produced, &s;erved for a while to give
the Me&s;&s;enians the advantage, but being at la&s;t <PB N="41" REF="44">
overthrown and be&s;ieged in the city of Ithoe, Ari&s;todemus finding all
things de&s;perate, &s;lew him&s;elf upon his daughter's grave. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3280.</NOTE> With him fell the kingdom of
Me&s;&s;enia, not without a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and many a
defeat of the Spartan army, which they held thus engaged for above twenty
years. Nor mu&s;t we omit one memorable tran&s;action of the Lacedaemonians
during this war: having drained their city of all its male inhabitants, and
obliged them|&s;elves by oath not to return until their de&s;igns were
accompli&s;hed; their women, in the mean time, remon&s;trated, that from their
long ab|&s;ence all po&s;terity would be at an end To re|medy this
inconvenience, they detached fifty of their mo&s;t promi&s;ing young men from
the army to go to Sparta, and to lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly with all the young women
they fancied. The offspring of the&s;e virgins were from them call|ed
Partheniae, who finding them&s;elves con|temned and &s;lighted by the Spartans
on their return, joined &s;ome years after in an in&s;urrec|tion with the
Helotes, but were &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed. Being expelled the &s;tate, they
went under the conduct of their captain, Philantus, and &s;et|tled at Tarentum,
in Italy.</P>
<P>After a rigorous &s;ubjection of thirty-nine years, the
Me&s;&s;enians once more made a vigo|rous <PB N="42" REF="45"> &s;truggle for
freedom, being headed by Ari&s;tomenes, a young man of great courage and
capacity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3319.</NOTE> The &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t
engage|ment was doubtful, and the Lacedaemonians being advi&s;ed by the oracle
to &s;end for a gene|ral from among the Athenians, this politic &s;tate &s;ent
them Tyrtaeus, a poet and &s;choolma&s;ter, who&s;e chief bu&s;ine&s;s was to
harrangue and re|peat his own ver&s;es. The Spartans were little plea&s;ed with
their new leader, but their vene|ration for the oracle kept them obedient to
his commands. Their &s;ucce&s;s, however, did not &s;eem to improve with their
duty; they &s;uffer|ed a defeat from Ari&s;tomenes, who, lo&s;ing his &s;hield
in the pur&s;uit, their total overthrow was prevented. A &s;econd and a third
defeat fol|lowed &s;oon after; &s;o that the Lacedaemonians, quite
di&s;pirited, had thoughts of concluding a peace upon any terms. But Tyrtaeus
&s;o en|flamed them by his orations and &s;ongs in prai&s;e of military glory,
that they re&s;olved upon an|other battle, in which they were victorious, and
&s;oon after Ari&s;tomenes was taken pri&s;oner in a &s;kirmi&s;h, with fifty
of his followers.</P>
<P>The adventures of this hero de&s;erve our no|tice. Being carried
pri&s;oner to Sparta, he was thrown into a deep dungeon which had been u&s;ed
for the execution of malefactors, <PB N="43" REF="46"> and his fifty &s;oldiers
with him. They were all killed by the fall except Ari&s;tomenes, who finding a
wild bea&s;t at the bottom preying up|on a carca&s;s, &s;ecuring the animal's
mouth, he continued to hold by the tail, until the bea&s;t made directly to its
hole. There finding the i&s;&s;ue too narrow, he was obliged to let go his
hold, but following the track with his eye, he perceived a glimmering from
above, and at length wrought his way out. After this extra|ordinary e&s;cape,
he repaired immediately to his troops, and at their head made a &s;ucce&s;s|ful
&s;ally, by night, again&s;t the Corinthian forces. Neverthele&s;s he was once
more &s;hortly after taken by &s;ome Cretans; but his keepers being made drunk,
he &s;tabbed them with their own daggers, and returned to his forces. But his
&s;ingle valour was not &s;ufficient to avert the ruin of his country;
although, with his own &s;ingle prowe&s;s, he had thrice earned the
Heca|tomphonia, a &s;acrifice due to tho&s;e who had killed one hundred of the
enemy hand to hand in battle, yet the body of his forces being &s;mall, and
fatigued with continual duty, the city of Eira, which he defended, was taken,
and the Me&s;&s;enians were obliged to take re|fuge with Anaxilas, a prince of
Sicily. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3340.</NOTE> As for Tyrtaeus, the
Lacedaemonians made him <PB N="44" REF="47"> free of their city, which was the
highe&s;t honour they had in their power to be&s;tow. By the acce&s;&s;ion of
the Me&s;&s;enian country to the territory of Sparta, this &s;tate became one
of the mo&s;t powerful of all Greece, and was &s;econd only to Athens, which
&s;tate it always con&s;idered with an eye of jealou&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Government of ATHENS, the Laws of SOLON, and
the Hi&s;tory of the Republic from the Time of SOLON to the commencement of the
PERSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P>WE now return to Athens. Codrus, the la&s;t king of this &s;tate,
having devot|ed him&s;elf for the good of his country, a magi&s;trate, under
the title of Archon, was appointed to &s;ucceed him. The fir&s;t who bore this
office was Medon, the &s;on of the late king, who, being oppo&s;ed by his
brother Nileus, was preferred by the oracle, and ac|cordingly inve&s;ted with
his new dignity. This magi&s;tracy was at fir&s;t for life; it was &s;oon after
reduced to a period of ten years, and at la&s;t became annual, and in this
&s;tate it con|tinued for near three hundred years. Dur|ing this inactive
government little offers to <PB N="45" REF="48"> adorn the page of hi&s;tory,
the &s;pirit of exten|&s;ive dominion had not as yet entered into Greece, and
the citizens were too much em|ployed in their private intrigues to attend to
foreign concerns. Athens therefore continued a long time incapable of enlarging
her power, content with &s;afety amid&s;t the contending in|tere&s;ts of
a&s;piring potentates and factious ci|tizens.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire of being governed by written laws at la&s;t made way for
a new change in govern|ment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M 3380.</NOTE> For more than a century they had
&s;een the good effects of laws in the regulation of the Spartan commonwealth;
and, as they were a more enlightened people, they expected greater advantages
from a new in&s;titution. In the choice, therefore, of a legi&s;lator, they
pitch|ed upon Draco, a man of acknowledged wi&s;|dom, and un&s;haken integrity,
but rigid even beyond human &s;ufferance. It does not ap|pear that any &s;tate
of Greece was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of written laws before his time. However, he
was not afraid to enact the mo&s;t &s;evere laws, which laid the &s;ame
penalties on the mo&s;t atro|cious and the mo&s;t trifling offences. The&s;e
laws, which puni&s;hed all crimes with death, and which were &s;aid not to be
written with ink, but with blood, were too cruel to be duly and 
<PB N="46" REF="49"> ju&s;tly admini&s;tered. Sentiments of humanity in the
judges, compa&s;&s;ion for the accu&s;ed when his fault was not equal to his
&s;uffering, the unwillingne&s;s of witne&s;&s;es to exact too cruel an
atonement, their fears al&s;o of the re&s;ent|ment of the people; all the&s;e
con&s;pired to ren|der the laws ob&s;olete before they could well be put into
execution. Thus, the new laws counteracted their own purpo&s;es, and their
exce&s;&s;ive rigour paved the way for the mo&s;t dangerous impunity.</P>
<P>It was in this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of the com|monwealth, that
Solon was applied to for his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as the wi&s;e&s;t and
the ju&s;te&s;t man of all Athens. His great learn|ing had acquired him the
reputation of being the fir&s;t of the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, and his
known humanity procured him the love and veneration of every rank among his
fel|low-citizens. Solon was a native of Salamis, an i&s;land dependent on
Athens, but which had revolted to put it&s;elf under the power of the
Megareans. In attempting to recover this i&s;land, the Athenians had &s;pent
much blood and trea&s;ure, until at la&s;t wearied out with &s;uch ill
&s;ucce&s;s, a law was made rendering it capital ever to advi&s;e the recovery
of their lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Solon, however, undertook to per|&s;uade 
<PB N="47" REF="50"> them to another trial, and feigning him&s;elf mad, ran
about the &s;treets, u&s;ing the mo&s;t violent ge&s;tures and language; but
the purport of all was, upbraiding the Athenians for their remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and
effeminacy, in giving up their conque&s;ts in de&s;pair. In &s;hort, he acted
his part &s;o well, by the oddity of his man|ner, and the &s;trength of his
rea&s;oning, that the people re&s;olved upon another expedition again&s;t
Salamis; and, by a &s;tratagem of his contrivance, in which he introduced
&s;everal young men upon the i&s;land in women's cloaths, the place was
&s;urpri&s;ed, and added to the do|minion of Athens.</P>
<P>But this was not the only occa&s;ion on which he exhibited
&s;uperior addre&s;s and wi&s;dom. At a time when Greece had carried the arts
of eloquence, poetry, and government, higher than they had yet been &s;een
among mankind, Solon was con&s;idered as one of the foremo&s;t in each
perfection. The &s;ages of Greece, who&s;e fame is &s;till undimini&s;hed,
acknow|ledged his merit, and adopted him as their a&s;|&s;ociate. The
corre&s;pondence between the&s;e wi&s;e men was at once in&s;tructive,
friendly, and &s;incere. They were &s;even in number, namely, Thales the
Mile&s;ian, Solon of Athens, Chilo of Lacedaemon, Pittacus of Mitylene,
Peri|ander <PB N="48" REF="51"> of Corinth, Bias and Cleobulus, who&s;e birth
places are not a&s;certained. Tho&s;e &s;ages often vi&s;ited each other, and
their conver&s;a|tions generally turned upon the methods of in&s;tituting the
be&s;t form of government, or the arts of private happine&s;s. One day when
So|lon went to Miletos to &s;ee Thales, the fir&s;t thing he &s;aid, was to
expre&s;s his &s;urprize that Thales had never de&s;ired to marry, or have
children. Thales made him no an&s;wer then, but a few days after, he contrived
that a &s;tran|ger, &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive from Athens, &s;hould join their
company. Solon, hearing from whence the &s;tranger came, was inqui&s;itive
af|ter the news of his own city, but was only in|formed that a young man died
there, for whom the whole place was in the greate&s;t af|fliction, as he was
reputed the mo&s;t promi&s;ing youth in all Athens. Alas! cried Solon, how much
is the poor father of the youth to be pitied! pray, what was his name? I heard
the name, replied the &s;tranger, who was in|&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion, but
I have forgot it: I only remember that all people talked much of his wi&s;dom
and ju&s;tice. Every an&s;wer af|forded new matter of trouble and terror to the
inqui&s;itive father, and he had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to a&s;k if the youth
was not the &s;on of <PB N="49" REF="52"> Solon? The very &s;ame, replied the
&s;tranger; at which words Solon &s;hewed all the marks of the mo&s;t
incon&s;oleable di&s;tre&s;s. This was the opportunity which Thales wanted, who
took him by the hand, and &s;aid to him, with a &s;mile, Comfort your&s;elf my
friend, all that has been told you is a mere fiction, but may &s;erve as a very
proper an&s;wer to your que&s;tion, why I never thought proper to marry?</P>
<P>One day at the court of Periander of Corinth, a que&s;tion was
propo&s;ed, which was the mo&s;t perfect popular government? That, &s;aid Bias,
where the law has no &s;uperior. That, &s;aid Thales, where the inhabitants are
neither too rich nor too poor. That, &s;aid Anachar&s;is, the Scythian, where
virtue is honoured and vice dete&s;ted. That, &s;aid Pittacus, where dignities
are always conferred upon the virtuous, and never upon the ba&s;e. That, &s;aid
Cleobulus, where the citizens fear blame more than puni&s;hment. That, &s;aid
Chilo, where the laws are more regarded than the orators. But Solon's opinion
&s;eems to have the greate&s;t weight, who &s;aid, where an injury done to the
meane&s;t &s;ubject is an in&s;ult upon the whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Upon a certain occa&s;ion, when Solon was conver&s;ing with
Anachar&s;is, the Scythian phi|lo&s;opher, about his intended reformations in 
<PB N="50" REF="53"> the &s;tate; 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas, cried the Scythian, all your laws will be
found to re&s;emble &s;piders webs; the weak and &s;mall flies will be caught
and entangled, but the great and powerful will always have &s;trength enough to
break through."</Q></P>
<P>Solon's interview with Crae&s;us king of Ly|dia, is &s;till more
celebrated. This monarch, who was reputed the riche&s;t of all A&s;ia Minor,
was willing to make an o&s;lentatious di&s;play of his wealth before the Greek
philo&s;opher, and after &s;hewing him immen&s;e heaps of trea&s;ure, and the
greate&s;t variety of other ornaments, he demanded whether he did not think the
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or the mo&s;t happy of all mankind. No, replied Solon; I know
one man more happy, a poor pea&s;ant of Greece, who neither in afflu|ence or
poverty, has but few wants, and has learned to &s;upply them by his labour.
This an&s;wer was by no means agreeable to the vain monarch, who by his
que&s;tion only hoped for a reply that would tend to flatter his pride.
Willing, therefore, to extort one &s;till more favourable, he a&s;ked whether
at lea&s;t he did not think him happy. Alas, cried Solon what man can be
pronounced happy before he dies. The integrity and the wi&s;dom of So+lon's
replies appeared in the event. The <PB N="51" REF="54"> kingdom of Lydia was
invaded by Cyrus, the empire de&s;troyed, and Crae&s;us him&s;elf was taken
pri&s;oner. When he was led out to exe|cution, according to the barbarous
manners of the times, he then too late recollected the maxims of Solon, and
could not help crying out when on the &s;caffold upon Solon's name: Cyrus
hearing him repeat the name with great earne&s;tne&s;s, was de&s;irous of
knowing the rea|&s;on; and being informed by Crae&s;us of that philo&s;opher's
remarkable ob&s;ervation, he be|gan to fear for him&s;elf, pardoned Crae&s;us,
and took him for the future into confidence and friend&s;hip. Thus Solon had
the merit of &s;aving one king's life, and of reforming an|other.</P>
<P>Such was the man to whom the Athenians applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance
in reforming the &s;everity of their government, and in&s;tituting a ju&s;t
body of laws. Athens was at that time divided in|to as many factions as there
were different &s;orts of inhabitants in Attica. Tho&s;e that lived up|on the
mountains were fond of exact equality, tho&s;e that lived in the low country
were for the dominion of a few, and tho&s;e that dwelt on the &s;ea coa&s;ts,
and were con&s;equently addicted to commerce, were for keeping tho&s;e parties
to exactly balanced, as to permit neither to <PB N="52" REF="55"> prevail. But,
be&s;ides the&s;e, there was a fourth party, and that by much the mo&s;t
numerous, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of the poor, who were griev|ou&s;ly
harra&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed by the rich, and loaded with debts which they
were not able to di&s;charge. This unhappy party, which, when they know their
own &s;trength, mu&s;t ever pre|vail, were now determined to throw off the yoke
of their oppre&s;&s;ors, and to chu&s;e them|&s;elves a chief who &s;hould make
a reformation in government, by making a new divi&s;ion of lands.</P>
<P>As Solon had never &s;ided with either, he was regarded as the
refuge of all, the rich lik|ing him becau&s;e he was rich, and the poor
be|cau&s;e he was hone&s;t. Though he was at fir&s;t unwilling to undertake
&s;o dangerous an em|ployment, he at la&s;t &s;uffered him&s;elf to be cho&s;en
archon, and to be con&s;tituted &s;upreme legi&s;lator with the unanimous
con&s;ent of all. This was a &s;ituation in which nothing could be added to his
power, yet many of the citizens advi&s;ed him to make him&s;elf king, but he
had too much wi&s;dom to &s;eek after a name which would render him obnoxious
to many of his fellow-citizens, while he was in fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more
than regal authority. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>A tyranny,</HI> he would &s;ay, <HI>re&s;embles
a fair garden, it is a beautiful</HI> <PB N="53" REF="56"> <HI>&s;pot while we
are within, but it wants a way to get out at.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Rejecting, therefore, the wi&s;h of royalty, he re&s;olved upon
&s;ettling a form of government that &s;hould be founded on the ba&s;is of
ju&s;t and rea&s;onable liberty. Not venturing to meddle with certain
di&s;orders which he looked upon as incurable, he undertook to bring about no
other alterations but &s;uch as were apparently rea&s;onable to the meane&s;t
capacity. In &s;hort, it was his aim to give the Athenians not the be&s;t of
po&s;&s;ible con&s;titutions, but the very be&s;t they were capable of
receiving. His fir&s;t at|tempt was, therefore, in favour of the poor, who&s;e
debts he aboli&s;hed at once, by an ex|pre&s;s law of in&s;olvency. But to do
this with the lea&s;t injury he could to the creditor, he rai&s;ed the value of
money in a moderate pro|portion, by which he nominally encrea&s;ed their
riches. But his management on this oc|ca&s;ion had like to have had very
dangerous con|&s;equences, for &s;ome of his friends, to whom the &s;cheme had
been previou&s;ly communicated, took up va&s;t &s;ums of money while it was
low, in order to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the difference when it became of
greater value. Solon him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of having a hand in this
fraud, but to wipe off all &s;u&s;picion, he remitted his debtors 
<PB N="54" REF="57"> five, or, as others &s;ay, fifteen talents, and thus
regained the confidence of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>His next &s;tep was to repeal all the laws enacted by Draco, except
tho&s;e again&s;t mur|der. He then proceeded to the regulation of offices,
employments, and magi&s;tracies, all which he left in the hands of the rich. He
di&s;tributed the rich citizens into three cla&s;&s;es, ranging them according
to their incomes. Tho&s;e that were found to have five hundred mea&s;ures
yearly, as well in corn as in liquids, were placed in the fir&s;t rank, tho&s;e
that had three hundred were placed in the &s;econd, and tho&s;e that had but
two hundred made up the third. All the re&s;t of the citizens who&s;e in|come
fell &s;hort of two hundred mea&s;ures, were compri&s;ed in a fourth and la&s;t
cla&s;s, and were con&s;idered as unqualified for any employment whatever. But
to compen&s;ate for this exclu|&s;ion, he gave every private citizen a
privilege of voting in the great a&s;&s;embly of the whole body of the &s;tate.
This, indeed, at fir&s;t might appear a conce&s;&s;ion of &s;mall
con&s;equence, but it was &s;oon found to contain very &s;olid advan|tages.
For, by the laws of Athens, it was permitted, after the determination of the
ma|gi&s;trates, to appeal to the general a&s;&s;embly of <PB N="55" REF="58">
the people, and thus, in time, all cau&s;es of weight and moment came before
them.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure to counteract the influence of a popular
a&s;&s;embly, he gave greater weight to the court of Areopagus, and al&s;o
in&s;titut|ed another council con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred. The Areopagus,
&s;o called from the place where the court was held, had been e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
&s;ome centuries before, but Solon re&s;tored and augmented its authority. To
this court was committed the care of cau&s;ing the laws to be ob&s;erved and
put in execution. Before his time the citizens of the greate&s;t probity and
ju&s;tice were made judges of that tribunal. So|lon was the fir&s;t who thought
it convenient that none &s;hould be honoured with that digni|ty but &s;uch as
had pa&s;&s;ed through the office of archon. Nothing was &s;o augu&s;t as this
court, and its reputation for judgment and integrity became &s;o very great,
that the Romans &s;ome|times referred cau&s;es which were too intricate for
their own deci&s;ion, to the determination of this tribunal. Nothing was
regarded here but truth; that no external objects might pervert ju&s;tice, the
tribunal was held in darkne&s;s, and the advocates were denied all attempts to
work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the judges. Superior to this, Solon in&s;tituted
the great council of four <PB N="56" REF="59"> hundred, who were to judge upon
appeals from the Areopagus, and maturely to exa|mine every que&s;tion before it
came to be de|bated in a general a&s;&s;embly of the people.</P>
<P>Such was the reformation in the general in|&s;titutions for the good
of the &s;tate, his parti|cular laws for di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice were more
nu|merous. In the fir&s;t place, all per&s;ons who in public di&s;&s;en&s;ions
and differences e&s;pou&s;ed neither party, but continued to act with a
blameable neutrality, were declared infamous, condemned to perpetual
puni&s;hment, and to have all their e&s;tates confi&s;cated. Nothing could more
induce mankind to a &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m than this celebrated law. A mind
thus obliged to take part in public concerns, learns, from habit, to make
tho&s;e concerns its principal care, and &s;elf-intere&s;t quickly &s;inks
before them. By this method of accu&s;toming the minds of the people to look
upon that man as an enemy that &s;hould appear indifferent and unconcerned in
the misfortunes of the public, he provided the &s;tate with a quick and general
re&s;ource in every dangerous emer|gency.</P>
<P>He next permitted every particular per|&s;on to e&s;pou&s;e the
quarrel of any one that was injured or in&s;ulted. By this means, every
per|&s;on <PB N="57" REF="60"> in the &s;tate became the enemy of him who did
wrong, and the turbulent thus were over|powered by the number of their
opponents.</P>
<P>He aboli&s;hed the cu&s;tom of giving portions in marriage with
young women, unle&s;s they were only daughters. The bride was to carry no other
fortune to her hu&s;band than three &s;uits of cloaths, and &s;ome hou&s;hold
goods of little value. It was his aim to prevent mak|ing matrimony a traffic,
he con&s;idered it as an honourable connexion, calculated for the mu|tual
happine&s;s of both parties, and the general advantage of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Before this lawgiver's time the Athenians were not allowed to make
their wills, but the wealth of the decea&s;ed naturally, and of cour&s;e,
devolved upon his children. Solon allowed every one that was childle&s;s to
di&s;po&s;e of his whole e&s;tate as he thought fit, preferring by that means
friend&s;hip to kindred, and choice to nece&s;&s;ity and con&s;traint. From
this in&s;titu|tion the bond between the parents and chil|dren became more
&s;olid and firm, it confirm|ed the ju&s;t authority of the one, and
encrea&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary dependence of the other.</P>
<P>He made a regulation to le&s;&s;en the rewards to the victors at the
Olympic and I&s;thmian games. He con&s;idered it as unju&s;t, that a &s;et 
<PB N="58" REF="61"> of idle people, generally u&s;ele&s;s, often danger|ous to
the &s;tate, &s;hould be allotted tho&s;e re|wards which &s;hould go to the
de&s;erving. He wi&s;hed to &s;ee tho&s;e emoluments go to the wi|dows and
families of &s;uch as fell in the &s;er|vice of their country, and to make the
&s;tipend of the &s;tate honourable, by being conferred only on the brave.</P>
<P>To encourage indu&s;try, the Areopagus was charged with the care of
examining into every man's method of living, and of cha&s;ti&s;ing all who led
an idle life. The unemployed were con&s;idered as a &s;et of dangerous and
turbulent &s;pirits, eager after innovation, and hoping to mend their fortunes
from the plunder of the &s;tate. To di&s;countenance all idlene&s;s,
there|fore, a &s;on was not obliged to &s;upport his fa|ther in old age or
nece&s;&s;ity, if the latter had neglected giving him &s;ome trade or
occupa|tion. All illegitimate children were al&s;o ex|empted from the &s;ame
duty, as they owed little to their parents except an indelible re|proach.</P>
<P>It was forbidden to give ill language in public; the magi&s;trates
who were not eligible till thirty were to be particularly circum&s;pect in
their behaviour, and it was even death for an archon to be taken drunk. It is
ob&s;ervable <PB N="59" REF="62"> that he made no law again&s;t parricide, as
&s;up|po&s;ing it a crime that could never exi&s;t in any community.</P>
<P>With regard to women, he permitted any man to kill an adulterer if
he was taken in the fact. He allowed of public brothels, but pro|hibited
mercenary pro&s;titutes from keeping company with mode&s;t women, and as a
badge of di&s;tinction to wear flowered garments. The men al&s;o who were
notorious for frequenting their company were not allowed to &s;peak in public,
and he who forced a woman incurred a very heavy fine.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the chief in&s;titutions of this ce|lebrated lawgiver,
and although neither &s;o &s;triking, nor yet &s;o well authori&s;ed as tho&s;e
of Lycurgus, they did not fail to operate for &s;everal &s;ucceeding ages, and
&s;eemed to gather &s;trength by ob&s;ervance. After he had framed the&s;e
in&s;titutes, his next care was to give them &s;uch notoriety that none could
plead ignorance. To this end tran&s;cripts of them were publicly hung up in the
city for every one to peru&s;e, while a &s;et of magi&s;trates named
The&s;mothetae, were appointed to revi&s;e them carefully, and di&s;tinctly
repeat them once a year. Then, in order to perpetuate his &s;ta|tutes, he
engaged the people by a public oath <PB N="60" REF="63"> to ob&s;erve them
religiou&s;ly, at lea&s;t for the term of an hundred years; and thus having
completed the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, he with|drew from the city to avoid the
importunity of &s;ome, and the captious petulance of others. For, as he well
knew, it was hard, if not im|po&s;&s;ible, to plea&s;e all.</P>
<P>Solon being thus employed on his travels in vi&s;iting Egypt, Lydia,
and &s;everal other countries, left Athens to become habituated to his new
in&s;titutions, and to try by experi|ence the wi&s;dom of their formation. But
it was not ea&s;y for a city long torn by civil di&s;&s;en|&s;ions to yield
implicit obedience to any laws, how wi&s;ely &s;oever framed; their former
ani|mo&s;ities began to revive when that authority was removed which alone
could hold them in &s;ubjection. The factions of the &s;tate were headed by
three different leaders, who en|flamed the animo&s;ity of the people again&s;t
each other, hoping by the &s;ubver&s;ion of all or|der, to indulge their own
private hopes of a&s;piring. A per&s;on named Lycurgus was at the head of the
people that inhabited the low country, Pi&s;i&s;tratus declared for tho&s;e who
lived in the mountains, and Megacles was the leader of the inhabitants upon the
&s;ea coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"> Pi&s;i&s;tratus was of the&s;e the mo&s;t
powerful. He was a well bred man, of a gentle and in|&s;inuating behaviour,
ready to &s;uccour and a&s;|&s;i&s;t the poor, who&s;e cau&s;e he pretended to
e&s;pou&s;e. He was wi&s;e, and moderate to his enemies, a mo&s;t artful and
accompli&s;hed di&s;|&s;embler, and was every way virtuous except in his
inordinate ambition. His ambition gave him the appearance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
qualities which he really wanted, he &s;eemed the mo&s;t zealous champion for
equality among the citizens, while he was actually aiming at the entire
&s;ubver&s;ion of freedom, and he declared loudly again&s;t all innovations,
while he was actually meditating a change. The giddy multitude caught by
the&s;e appearances were zealous in &s;econding his views, and without
examining his motives were driving headlong to tyranny and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t at the eve of &s;ucce&s;s, and upon the point of being
indulged in his utmo&s;t am|bition, that Pi&s;i&s;tratus had the mortification
of &s;eeing Solon return after an ab&s;ence of ten years, apprized of his
de&s;igns, and willing to &s;ubvert his &s;chemes. Sen&s;ible, therefore, of
his danger, and con&s;cious of the penetration of this great lawgiver, the
a&s;piring demagogue u&s;ed all his artifice to conceal his real de&s;igns, 
<PB N="62" REF="65"> and while he flattered him in public, u&s;ed eve|ry
endeavour to bring over the people to &s;e|cond his intere&s;ts. Solon at
fir&s;t endeavoured to oppo&s;e art to his cunning, and to foil him at his own
weapons. He prai&s;ed him in his turn, and was heard to declare, what might
have been true, that excepting the immoderate am|bition of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, he
knew no man of greater, or more exalted virtues. Still, however, he &s;et
him&s;elf to counteract his projects, and to defeat his de&s;igns before they
were ripe for execution.</P>
<P>But in a vicious commonwealth, no a&s;&s;iduity can warn, no
wi&s;dom protect. Pi&s;i&s;tratus &s;till urged his &s;chemes with unabating
ardour, and every day made new pro&s;elytes by his profe&s;|&s;ions and his
liberalities. At length, finding his &s;chemes ripe for open action, he gave
him|&s;elf &s;everal wounds, and in that condition, with his body all bloody,
he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried in his chariot to the market-place, where,
by his complaints and eloquence, he &s;o en&s;lamed the populace, that they
con&s;idered him as the victim of their cau&s;e, and as &s;uffer|ing &s;uch
cruel treatment in their defence. An a&s;&s;embly of the people was, therefore,
imme|diately convened, from whom he demanded a guard of fifty per&s;ons for his
future &s;ecurity. <PB N="63" REF="66"> It was in vain that Solon u&s;ed all
his authority and eloquence to oppo&s;e &s;o dangerous a reque&s;t. He
con&s;idered his &s;ufferings as merely coun|terfeited. He compared him to
Uly&s;&s;es in Homer, who cut him&s;elf with &s;imilar de&s;igns; but he
alledged that he did not act the part right, for the de&s;ign of Uly&s;&s;es
was to deceive his enemies, but that of Pi&s;i&s;tratus was level|ed again&s;t
his friends and &s;upporters. He up|braided the people with their &s;tupidity,
telling them, that for his own part he had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee through
this de&s;ign, but they only had &s;trength enough to oppo&s;e it. His
exhortations, however, were vain, the party of Pi&s;i&s;tratus prevailed, and a
guard of fifty men was appointed to attend him. This was all that he aimed at,
for now having the protec|tion of &s;o many creatures of his own, nothing
remained but in&s;en&s;ibly to encrea&s;e their num|ber. Thus every day his
hirelings were &s;een to augment, while the &s;ilent fears of the citi|zens
encrea&s;ed in equal proportion. But it was now too late, for having rai&s;ed
the number to put him beyond the danger of a repui&s;e, he at length &s;eized
upon the citadel, while none was left who had courage or conduct to
oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this general con&s;ternation, which was the re&s;ult of folly on
the one hand, and treachery <PB N="64" REF="67"> on the other, the whole city
was one &s;cene of tumult and di&s;order, &s;ome flying, others inly
complaining, others preparing for &s;lavery with patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.
Solon was the only man who, without fear or &s;hrinking, deplored the folly of
the times, and reproached the Athe|nians with their cowardice and treachery.
You might, &s;aid he, with ea&s;e have cru&s;hed the tyrant in the bud, but
nothing now remains but to pluck him up by the roots. As for him&s;elf, he had
at lea&s;t the &s;atisfaction of hav|ing di&s;charged his duty to his country
and the laws; and, as for the re&s;t, he had nothing to fear, and now upon the
de&s;truction of his country, his only confidence was in his great age, which
gave him hopes of not being a long &s;urvivor. In fact, he did not &s;ur|vive
the liberty of his country above two years; he died at Cyprus in the eightieth
year of his age, lamented and admired by every &s;tate of Greece. Be&s;ides his
&s;kill in le|gi&s;lation, Solon was remarkable for &s;everal other &s;hining
qualifications. He under&s;tood eloquence in &s;o high a degree, that from him
Cicero dates the origin of eloquence in Athens. He was &s;ucce&s;sful al&s;o in
poetry, and Plato a&s;&s;erts, that it was only for want of due application
that he did not come <PB N="65" REF="68"> to di&s;pute the prize with Homer
him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The death of Solon only &s;erved to involve Athens in new troubles
and commotions. Ly|curgus and Megacles, the leaders of the two oppo&s;ite
factions, uniting, drove Pi&s;i&s;tratus out of the city, but he was &s;oon
after recalled by Megacles, who gave him his daughter in marriage. New
di&s;turbances aro&s;e; Pi&s;i&s;tratus was twice depo&s;ed, and twice found
means to rein&s;tate him&s;elf, for he had art to acquire power, and moderation
to maintain it. The mildne&s;s of his government, and his implicit
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws, made the people forget the means by which he
acquired his power; and, caught by his lenity, they overlooked his
u&s;urpation. His gardens and plea&s;ure grounds were free to all the citizens;
and he is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who opened a public library at Athens.
Cicero is of opinion, that Pi&s;i&s;tratus fir&s;t made the Athenians
acquainted with the books of Homer, that he di&s;po&s;ed them in the order in
which they now remain, and fir&s;t cau&s;ed them to be read at the fea&s;ts
called Pa|nathanea. His ju&s;tice is not le&s;s remarkable than his
politene&s;s. Being accu&s;ed of murder, though it was in the time of his
tyranny, he di&s;dained to take the advantage of his autho|rity, 
<PB N="66" REF="69"> but went in per&s;on to plead his cau&s;e before the
Areopagus, where his accu&s;er would not venture to appear. In &s;hort, he was
ma&s;ter of many excellent qualities, and perverted them no farther than as
they &s;tood in competition with empire. Nothing could be objected to him but
his having greater power than the laws, and by not exerting that power he
al|mo&s;t reconciled the citizens to royalty. Upon the&s;e accounts he was
de&s;ervedly oppofed to u&s;urpers of fewer virtues, and there feemed &s;uch a
re&s;emblance between him and a more &s;ucce&s;sful invader of his country's
freedom, that Julius Cae&s;ar was called the Pi&s;i&s;tratus of Rome.</P>
<P>Pi&s;i&s;tratus dying in tranquillity, tran&s;mitted the &s;overeign
power to his &s;ons, Hippias and Hipparchus, who &s;eemed to inherit all their
father's virtues. A pa&s;&s;ion for learning and its profe&s;&s;ors, had for
&s;ome time prevailed in Athens; and this city, which had already far out-gone
all its cotemporaries in all the arts of refinement, &s;eemed to &s;ubmit
tamely to kings, who made learning their pride and their pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
Anacreon, Simonides, and others, were invited to their courts, and richly
reward|ed. Schools were in&s;tituted for the improve|ment of youth in the
learned profe&s;&s;ions, and <PB N="67" REF="70"> Mercuries were &s;et up in
all the highways, with moral &s;entences written upon them, for the
in|&s;truction of the lowe&s;t vulgar. Their reign, however, la&s;ted but
eighteen years, and ended upon the following occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton, both citizens of Athens, had contracted
a very &s;trict friend|&s;hip for each other, and re&s;olved to revenge the
injuries which &s;hould be committed again&s;t either with common re&s;entment.
Hipparchus being naturally amorous, debauched the &s;i&s;ter of Harmodius, and
afterwards publi&s;hed her &s;hame as &s;he was about to walk in one of the
&s;acred proce&s;&s;ions, alledging, that &s;he was not in a condition to
a&s;&s;i&s;t at the ceremony. Such a complicated indignity naturally excited
the re&s;entment of the two friends, who formed a fixed re&s;olution of
de&s;troying the tyrants, or falling in the attempt. Willing, however, to wait
the mo&s;t favourable opportunity, they de|ferred their purpo&s;e to the
fea&s;t of the Pana|thanea, in which the ceremony required that all the
citizens &s;hould attend in armour. For their greater &s;ecurity, they admitted
only a &s;mall number of their friends into the &s;ecret of their de&s;ign,
conceiving that upon the fir&s;t com|motion they &s;hould not want for
abettors. Thus re&s;olved, the day being come, they went early 
<PB N="68" REF="71"> into the market-place, each armed with his dagger, and
&s;teadfa&s;t to his purpo&s;e. In the mean time, Hippias was &s;een
i&s;&s;uing with his followers from the palace, to give orders with|out the
city to the guards for the intended ceremony. As the two friends continued to
follow him at a little di&s;tance, they perceived one of tho&s;e to whom they
had communicated their de&s;ign, talking very familiarly with him, which made
them apprehend their plot was betrayed. Eager, therefore, to execute their
de&s;ign, they were preparing to &s;trike the blow, but recollected that the
real aggre&s;&s;or would thus go unpuni&s;hed. They once more, there|fore,
returned into the city, willing to begin their vengeance upon the author of
their in|dignities. They were not long in que&s;t of Hip|parchus, they met him
upon their return, and ru&s;hing upon him, di&s;patched him with their daggers
without delay, but were &s;oon after them&s;elves &s;lain in the tumult.
Hippias hear|ing of what was done, to prevent farther di&s;|orders, got all
the&s;e di&s;armed whom he in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected of being privy to the
de&s;ign, and then meditated revenge.</P>
<P>Among the friends of the late a&s;&s;ertors of freedom, was one
Leona, a courtezan, who by the charms of her beauty, and her &s;kill in 
<PB N="69" REF="72"> playing on the harp, had captivated &s;ome of the
con&s;pirators, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be deep|ly engaged in the de&s;ign. As
the tyrant, for &s;uch the late attempt had rendered him, was con&s;cious that
nothing was concealed from this woman, he ordered her to be put to the torture,
in order to extort the names of accomplices. But &s;he bore all the cruelty of
their torments with invincible con&s;tancy; and le&s;t &s;he &s;hould in the
agony of pain be induced to a confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he bit off her own tongue and
&s;pit it in the ty|rant's face. In this manner &s;he died faithful to the
cau&s;e of liberty, &s;hewing the world a remarkable example of con&s;tancy in
her &s;ex. The Athenians would not &s;uffer the memory of &s;o heroic an action
to pa&s;s into oblivion. They erected a &s;tatue to her memory, in which a
lione&s;s was repre&s;ented without a tongue.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hippias put no bounds to his indignation. A
rebellious people ever makes a &s;u&s;picious tyrant. Numbers of citi|zens were
put to death; and to guard him&s;elf for the future again&s;t a like
enterprize, he en|deavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his power by foreign alliances. He
gave his daughter in marriage to the &s;on of the tyrant of Lamp&s;acus, he
cul|tivated a corre&s;pondence with Artaphanes, go|vernor <PB N="70" REF="73">
of Sardis, and endeavoured to gain the friend&s;hip of the Lacedaemonians, who
were at that time the mo&s;t powerful people of Greece.</P>
<P>But he was &s;upplanted in tho&s;e very alliances from which he
hoped the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The family of the Alcmaeonidae, who from
the beginning of the revolution had been bani&s;hed from Athens, endeavoured to
undermine his intere&s;ts at Sparta, and they at length &s;ucceed|ed. Being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great riches, and al&s;o very liberal in their
di&s;tribution, among other public &s;ervices, they obtained liberty to rebuild
the temple at Delphos, which they fronted in a mo&s;t magnificence manner with
Parian marble. So noble a munificence was not without a proper acknowledgement
of gratitude from the prie&s;te&s;s of Apollo, who, willing to oblige them,
made her oracle the echo of their de|&s;ires. As there was nothing, therefore,
which this family &s;o ardently de&s;ired as the downfall of regal power in
Athens, the prie&s;te&s;s &s;econd|ed their intentions, and whenever the
Spartans came to con&s;ult the oracle, no promi&s;e was ever made of the god's
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but upon con|dition that Athens &s;hould be &s;et free. This
order was &s;o often repeated by the oracle, that the Spartans at la&s;t
re&s;olved to obey. Their <PB N="71" REF="74"> fir&s;t attempts were, however,
un&s;ucce&s;sful; the troops they &s;ent again&s;t the tyrant were repul&s;ed
with lo&s;s. A &s;econd effort &s;ucceeded. Athens was be&s;ieged, and the
children of Hippias were made pri&s;oners as they were &s;ecretly conveying to
a place of &s;afety out of the city. To redeem the&s;e from &s;lavery, the
father was obliged to come to an accommodation, by which he con|&s;ented to
give up his preten&s;ions to the &s;ove|reign power, and to depart out of the
Athenian territories in the &s;pace of five days. Thus, Athens was once more
&s;et free from its tyrants, and obtained its liberty the very &s;ame year that
the kings were expelled from Rome. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3496</NOTE> The fa|mily of Alcmaeon were
chiefly in&s;trumental, but the people &s;eemed fonder of acknowledg|ing their
obligations to the two friends who &s;truck the fir&s;t blow. The names of
Harmo|dius and Ari&s;togiton were held in the highe&s;t re&s;pect in all
&s;ucceeding ages, and &s;carce con&s;i|dered inferior even to the gods
them&s;elves. Their &s;tatues were erected in the market-place, an honour which
had never been rendered to any before; and, gazing upon the&s;e, the people
caught a love for freedom, and a dete&s;tation for tyranny, which neither time
nor terrors could ever after remove.</P>

<P>HITHERTO we have &s;een the &s;tates of Greece in con&s;tant
fluctuation, different &s;tates ri&s;ing, and others di&s;appearing, one petty
peo|ple oppo&s;ed to another, and both &s;wallowed up by a third. Every city
emerging from the ancient form of government which was origi|nally impo&s;ed
upon it, and by degrees acquir|ing greater freedom. We have &s;een the
intro|duction of written laws, and the benefits they produced by giving
&s;tability to government.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;truggles for power among their neighbouring
&s;tates, and for freedom at home, the moral &s;ciences, the arts of eloquence,
poetry, arms, were making a rapid progre&s;s among them, and tho&s;e
in&s;titutions which they originally borrowed from the Egyptians, were every
day receiving &s;ignal improvements. As Greece was now compo&s;ed of &s;everal
&s;mall re|publics bordering upon each other, and dif|fering in their laws,
characters, and cu&s;toms, <PB N="73" REF="76"> this was a continual &s;ource
of emulation, and every city was not only de&s;irous of warlike &s;u|periority,
but al&s;o of excelling in all the arts of peace and refinement. Hence they
were always under arms, and continually exerci&s;ed in war, while their
philo&s;ophers and poets tra|velled from city to city, and by their
exhorta|tions and &s;ongs, warmed them with a love of virtue, and with an
ardour for military glory. The&s;e peaceful and military accompli&s;hments
rai&s;ed them to their highe&s;t pitch of grandeur, and they now only wanted an
enemy worthy of their arms to &s;hew the world their &s;uperiority. The
Per&s;ian monarchy, the greate&s;t at that time in the world, &s;oon offered
it&s;elf as their oppon|ent, and the conte&s;t ended with its total
&s;ub|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>But as Greece was continually changing not only its government, but
its cu&s;toms, as in one century it pre&s;ented a very different pic|ture from
what it offered in the preceding, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;econd
view of this confederacy of little republics previous to their conte&s;ts with
Per&s;ia, as by comparing their &s;trength with that of their opponent, we
&s;hall find how much wi&s;dom, di&s;cipline, and va|lour, are &s;uperior to
numbers, wealth, and o&s;tentation.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"> Foremo&s;t in this confederacy we may rec|kon
the city of Athens, commanding the little &s;tate of Attica, their whole
dominions &s;carce ex|ceeding the large&s;t of our Engli&s;h counties in
cir|cumference. But what was wanting in extent was made up by the citizens
being inured to war, and impre&s;&s;ed with the highe&s;t ideas of their own
&s;uperiority. Their orators, their philo&s;ophers, and their poets, had
already given le&s;&s;ons of politene&s;s to mankind; and their generals,
though engaged only in petty conflicts with their neighbours, had begun to
practi&s;e new &s;tratagems in war. There were three kinds of inhabitants in
Athens; citizens, &s;trangers, and &s;ervants. Their number u&s;ual|ly amounted
to twenty-one thou&s;and citizens, ten thou&s;and &s;trangers, and from forty
to three&s;core thou&s;and &s;ervants.</P>
<P>A citizen could only be &s;uch by birth, or adoption. To be a
natural denizen of Athens, it was nece&s;&s;ary to be born of a father and
mo|ther both Athenians, and both free. The people could confer the freedom of
the city upon &s;trangers, and tho&s;e whom they had &s;o adopted, enjoyed
almo&s;t the &s;ame rights and privileges as the natural citizens. The quality
of citizen of Athens was &s;ometimes granted in honour and gratitude to tho&s;e
who merited <PB N="75" REF="78"> well of the &s;tate, as to Hippocrates the
phy&s;ician; and even kings &s;ometimes canva&s;&s;ed that title for
them&s;elves and their children. When the young men attained the age of twenty,
they were enrolled upon the li&s;t of citizens, after having taken an oath, and
in virtue of this they be|came members of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Strangers, or foreigners, who came to &s;ettle at Athens for the
&s;ake of commerce, or of ex|erci&s;ing any trade, had no &s;hare in
govern|ment, nor votes in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people. They put
them&s;elves under the protection of &s;ome citizen, and upon that account were
obliged to render him certain duties and &s;er|vices. They paid a yearly
tribute to the &s;tate of twelve drachmas, and in default of pay|ment were made
&s;laves, and expo&s;ed to &s;ale.</P>
<P>Of &s;ervants, there were &s;ome free, and others &s;laves, who had
been taken in war, or bought of &s;uch as trafficked in them. The Athenians
were as remarkable for their lenity to the&s;e un|happy men, as the Spartans
were noted for their fiercene&s;s and rigidity. There was even an a&s;ylum for
&s;laves, where the bones of The|&s;eus had been interred; and that a&s;ylum
&s;ub|&s;i&s;ted for near two thou&s;and years. When &s;laves were treated with
too much rigour and inhumanity, they might bring their ma&s;ters to 
<PB N="76" REF="79"> ju&s;tice; who, if the fact were &s;ufficiently prov|ed,
were obliged to &s;ell them to another ma&s;|ter. They could even ran&s;om
them&s;elves again&s;t their ma&s;ter's con&s;ent, when they had laid up money
enough for that purpo&s;e, for out of what they got by their labour, after
having paid a certain proportion to their ma&s;|ters, they kept the remainder
for them&s;elves, and made a &s;tock of it at their own di&s;po&s;al. Private
per&s;ons when they were &s;atisfied with their &s;ervices, often gave them
their liberty; and when the nece&s;&s;ity of the times obliged the &s;tate to
make their greate&s;t levies, they were enrolled among the troops, and from
thence were ever after free.</P>
<P>The revenues of this city, according to Ari|&s;tophanes, amounted to
two thou&s;and talents, or about three hundred thou&s;and pounds of our money.
They were generally gathered from the taxes upon agriculture, the &s;ale of
woods, the produce of mines, the contribu|tions paid them by their allies, a
capitulation levied upon the inhabitants of the country, as well natives as
&s;trangers, and from fines laid upon different mi&s;demeanors. The
applica|tion of the&s;e revenues was in paying the troops, both by land and
&s;ea, building and fitting out &s;leets, keeping up and repairing public
build|ings, <PB N="77" REF="80"> temples, walls, ports, and citadels. But in
the decline of the republic, the greate&s;t part was con&s;umed in frivolous
expences, games, fea&s;ts, and &s;hows, which co&s;t immen&s;e &s;ums, and were
of no manner of utility to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t glory of Athens, was its be|ing the &s;chool and
abode of polite learning, arts, and &s;ciences. The &s;tudy of poetry,
elo|quence, philo&s;ophy, and mathematics began there, and came almo&s;t to
their utmo&s;t per|fection. The young people were &s;ent fir&s;t to learn
grammar under ma&s;ters who taught them regularly, and upon the principles of
their own language. Eloquence was &s;tudied with &s;till greater attention, as
in that popular govern|ment it opened the way to the highe&s;t employ|ments. To
the &s;tudy of rhetoric was annex|ed that of philo&s;ophy, which compri&s;ed
all the &s;ciences; and in the&s;e there were many ma&s;|ters, very
conver&s;ant, but, as is common, their vanity &s;till greater than their
preten|&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the &s;ubordinate &s;tates of Greece &s;eemed to make Athens the
object of their imitation; and, though inferior to it upon the whole, yet each
produced great &s;cholars, and remarkable warriors in its turn. Sparta alone
took ex|ample from no other &s;tate, but &s;till rigorou&s;ly 
<PB N="78" REF="81"> attached to the in&s;titutions of its great law|giver,
Lycurgus, it di&s;dained all the arts of peace, which, while they poli&s;hed,
&s;erved to enervate the mind, and, formed only for war, they looked forward to
campaigns and battles, as &s;cenes of re&s;t and tranquillity. All the laws of
Sparta, and all the in&s;titutions of Ly|curgus, &s;eemed to have no other
object than war; all other employments, arts, polite learn|ing, &s;ciences,
trades, and even hu&s;bandry it|&s;elf, were prohibited among&s;t them. The
ci|tizens of Lacedaemon were of two &s;orts, either tho&s;e who inhabited the
city of Sparta, and, who for that rea&s;on were called Spartans, and tho&s;e
who inhabited the country dependent thereon. In the times of Lycurgus the
Spar|tans amounted to nine thou&s;and men, the coun|trymen to thirty
thou&s;and. This number was rather dimini&s;hed than encrea&s;ed in
&s;ucceeding times, but it &s;till compo&s;ed a formidable body, that often
gave laws to the re&s;t of Greece. The Spartan &s;oldiers, properly &s;o
called, were con|&s;idered as the flower of the nation, and we may judge of
their e&s;timation by the anxiety the republic expre&s;&s;ed when three hundred
of them were once taken pri&s;oners by the Athenians.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the great valour of the Spartan &s;tate, it
was formed rather for a de|fen&s;ive <PB N="79" REF="82"> than an offen&s;ive
war. They were al|ways careful to &s;pare the troops of their coun|try, and as
they had very little money, they were not in a capacity to &s;end their armies
up|on di&s;tant expeditions.</P>
<P>The armies both of Sparta and Athens were compo&s;ed of four &s;orts
of troops: citizens, al|lies, mercenaries, and &s;laves. The greate&s;t number
of troops in the two republics were compo&s;ed of allies, who were paid by the
ci|ties who &s;ent them. Tho&s;e which received pay from their employers were
&s;tyled mercenaries. The number of &s;laves attending on every army was very
great, and the Helotes, in particular, were employed as light infantry.</P>
<P>The Greek infantry con&s;i&s;ted of two kinds of &s;oldiers; the one
heavy armed, and carrying great &s;hields, &s;pears, and &s;cymetars; the other
light armed, carrying javelins, bows, and &s;lings. The&s;e were commonly
placed in the front of the battle, or upon the wings, to &s;hoot their arrows,
or fling their javelins and &s;tones at the enemy, and then retire through the
in|tervals behind the ranks, to dart out occa&s;ion|ally upon the retiring
enemy.</P>
<P>The Athenians were pretty much &s;trangers to cavalry, and the
Lacedaemonians did nor begin the u&s;e till after the war with Me&s;&s;ene. 
<PB N="80" REF="83"> They rai&s;ed their hor&s;e principally in a &s;mall city
not far from Lacedaemon, called Sciros, and they were always placed on the
extremity of the left wing, which po&s;t they claimed as their rightful
&s;tation.</P>
<P>But to recompence this defect of cavalry, the Athenians, in naval
affairs, had a great &s;upe|riority over all the &s;tates of Greece. As they
had an exten&s;ive &s;ea coa&s;t; and as the profe&s;|&s;ion of a merchant was
held reptuable among them, their navy encrea&s;ed, and was at length
&s;ufficiently powerful to intimidate the fleets of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Such were the two &s;tates, that in &s;ome mea|&s;ure engro&s;&s;ed
all the power of Greece to them|&s;elves; and, though &s;everal petty kingdoms
&s;till held their governments in independence, yet they owed their &s;afety to
the mutual jea|lou&s;y of the&s;e powerful rivals, and always found &s;helter
from the one again&s;t the oppre&s;|&s;ions of the other. Indeed the
di&s;&s;imilarity of their habits, manners, and education, &s;erved as well to
divide the&s;e two &s;tates, as their politi|cal ambition. The Lacedaemonians
were &s;e|vere, and &s;eemed to have &s;omething almo&s;t brutal in their
character. A government too rigid, and a life too laborious, rendered their
tempers haughtily &s;ullen and untractable. The <PB N="81" REF="84" MS="y">
Athenians were naturally obliging and agree|able, chearful among each other,
and hu|mane to their inferiors, but they were re&s;tle&s;s, unequal, timorous
friends, and capricious pro|tectors. From hence neither republic could
&s;ufficiently win over the &s;maller &s;tates of Greece to their intere&s;ts;
and, although their ambi|tion would not &s;uffer the country to remain in
repo&s;e, yet their obvious defects were always a bar to the &s;preading their
dominion. Thus the mutual jealou&s;y of the&s;e &s;tates kept them both in
con&s;tant readine&s;s for war, while their common defects kept the le&s;&s;er
&s;tates inde|pendent.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. From the Expul&s;ion of HIPPIAS to the Death of
DARIUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in this di&s;po&s;ition of Athens and Sparta, and of the
le&s;&s;er &s;tates, their neigh|bours, that the Per&s;ian monarchy began to
in|tere&s;t it&s;elf in their di&s;putes, and made it&s;elf an umpire in their
contentions for liberty, on|ly to &s;eize upon the liberties of all. It has
been already related, that Hippias being be|&s;ieged in Athens, and his
children being taken <PB N="82" REF="85"> pri&s;oners, in order to relea&s;e
them, he con&s;ented to abdicate the &s;overeign power, and to leave the
dominions of Athens in five days. Athens, however, in recovering its liberty,
did not en|joy that tranquility which freedom is thought to be&s;tow. Two of
the principal citizens, Cali&s;thenes, a favourite of the people, and
I&s;a|goras, who was &s;upported by the rich, began to contend for that power
which they had but a little before joined in depre&s;&s;ing. The for|mer, who
was become very popular, made an alteration in the form of their
e&s;tabli&s;hment; and, in&s;tead of four tribes, whereof they before
con&s;i&s;ted, enlarged their number to ten. He al&s;o in&s;tituted the manner
of giving votes by O&s;traci&s;m, as it was called. The manner of performing
this, was for every citizen, not under &s;ixty years old, to give in a name
written upon a tile, or oy&s;ter-&s;hell, (from whence the method of voting had
its name) and he upon whom the majority fell was pronounced bani&s;hed for ten
years. The&s;e laws evidently calculated to encrea&s;e the power of the people,
were &s;o di&s;|plea&s;ing to I&s;agoras, that, rather than &s;ubmit, he had
recour&s;e to Cleomenes king of Sparta, who undertook to e&s;pou&s;e his
quarrel. In fact, the Lacedaemonians only wanted a favourable pretext for
le&s;&s;ening and de&s;troying the power <PB N="83" REF="86"> of Athens, which,
in con&s;equence of the com|mand of the oracle, they had &s;o lately re&s;cued
from tyranny. Cleomenes, therefore, avail|ing him&s;elf of the divided &s;tate
of the city, en|tered Athens, and procured the bani&s;hment of Cali&s;thenes,
with &s;even hundred families more, who had &s;ided with him in the late
commo|tions. Not content with this, he endeavoured to new model the &s;tate,
but being &s;trongly op|po&s;ed by the &s;enate, he &s;eized upon the cita|del,
from whence, however, in two days he was obliged to retire. Cali&s;thenes
perceiving the enemy withdrawn, returned with his fol|lowers, and finding it
vain to make any farther attempts for power, re&s;tored the government as
&s;ettled by Solon.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lacedaemonians re|penting the &s;ervices they
had rendered their rival &s;tate, and perceiving the impo&s;ture of the oracle,
by which they were thus impelled to act again&s;t their own intere&s;ts, began
to think of rein&s;tating Hippias on the throne. But, previous to their
attempt, they judged it pru|dent to con&s;ult the &s;ubordinate &s;tates of
Greece, and to &s;ee what hopes they had of their concur|rence and approbation.
Nothing however could be more mortifying than the univer&s;al dete&s;ta|tion
with which their propo&s;al was received by <PB N="84" REF="87"> the deputies
of the &s;tates of Greece. The de|puty of Corinth expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t
indigna|tion at the de&s;ign, and &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed that the Spartans,
who were the avowed enemies of tyrants, &s;hould thus e&s;pou&s;e the
intere&s;ts of one noted for cruelty and u&s;urpation. The re&s;t of the
&s;tates warmly &s;econded his &s;enti|ments, and the Lacedaemonians, covered
with confu&s;ion and remor&s;e, abandoned Hippias and his cau&s;e for ever
after.</P>
<P>Hippias being thus fru&s;trated in his hopes of exciting the Greeks
to &s;econd his preten|&s;ions, was re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to one who
was con&s;idered as a much more powerful patron. Wherefore, taking his leave of
the Spartans, he applied him&s;elf to Artaphernes, governor of Sardis, for the
king of Per&s;ia, whom he endeavoured by every art to engage in a war again&s;t
Athens. He repre&s;ented to him the divided &s;tate of the city, he enlarged
upon its riches, and the happine&s;s of its &s;itua|tion for trade. He added
the ea&s;e with which it might be taken, and the glory that would at|tend
&s;ucce&s;s. Influenced by the&s;e motives, the pride and the avarice of the
Per&s;ian court were enflamed, and nothing was &s;o ardently &s;ought as the
pretext of a di&s;pute with the Athenians. When, therefore, that city &s;ent 
<PB N="85" REF="88"> to the Per&s;ian court to vindicate their proceed|ings,
alledging, that Hippias de&s;erved no coun|tenance from &s;o great a people;
the an&s;wer re|turned was, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>That if the Athenians would be &s;afe, they
mu&s;t admit Hippias for their king.</HI></Q> Athens having &s;o lately thrown
off the yoke, had too lively a &s;en&s;e of its pa&s;t calamities to accept
&s;afety upon &s;uch ba&s;e conditions, and re&s;olved to &s;uffer the la&s;t
extremity rather than open their gates to a tyrant. When Artaphernes,
therefore, demanded the re&s;toration of Hip|pias, the Athenians boldly
returned him a downright and ab&s;olute refu&s;al. From this aro&s;e the war
between Greece and Per&s;ia, one of the mo&s;t glorious, and the mo&s;t
remarkable that ever graced the annals of kingdoms.</P>
<P>But there were more cau&s;es than one tend|ing to make a breach
between the&s;e powerful nations, and producing an irreconcileable aver|&s;ion
for each other. The Greek colonies of Ionia, Aeolia, and Caria, that were
&s;ettled for above five hundred years in A&s;ia Minor, were at length
&s;ubdued by Crae&s;us king of Lydia; and he, in turn, &s;inking under the
power of Cyrus, his conque&s;ts of cour&s;e fell in with the re&s;t of his
dominions. The Per&s;ian monarch thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very exten&s;ive
territory, placed governors over the &s;everal cities that were 
<PB N="86" REF="89"> thus &s;ubdued; and as men bred up in a de&s;|potic court,
were likely enough to imitate the example &s;et them at home, it is probable
enough they abu&s;ed their power. Be this as it may, in all the Greek cities
they were called Tyrants; and as the&s;e little &s;tates had not yet lo&s;t all
idea of freedom, they took every op|portunity to recover their liberty, and
made many bold, but un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles in that glorious cau&s;e. The
Ionians particularly, who bore the greate&s;t &s;way among them, let no
oc|ca&s;ion &s;lip which promi&s;ed the &s;malle&s;t hopes of &s;haking off the
Per&s;ian yoke.</P>
<P>That which favoured their de&s;igns upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion,
was the expedition of Darius into Scythia, into which country he &s;ent a
nu|merous army, laying a bridge over the river I&s;ter for that purpo&s;e. The
Ionians were ap|pointed to guard this important pa&s;s, but were advi&s;ed by
Miltiades, whom we &s;hall after|wards find performing nobler exploits, to
break down the bridge, and thus cut off the Per&s;ian retreat. The Ionians,
however, rejected his coun&s;el, and Darius returned with his army into Europe,
where he added Thrace and Ma|cedon to the number of his conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tiaeus, the tyrant of Miletos, was the per&s;on who oppo&s;ed
the advice of Miltiades; <PB N="87" REF="90"> who, being of an ambitious and
intriguing di&s;|po&s;ition, was willing to le&s;&s;en the merit of all his
cotemporaries, in order to enhance his own. But he was deceived in his
expecta|tions of &s;ucce&s;s; from the&s;e &s;chemes Darius ju&s;tly
&s;u&s;pecting his fidelity, took him with him to Su&s;a, under pretence of
u&s;ing his friend|&s;hip and advice, but in reality of preventing his future
machinations at home. But Hi&s;|tyaeus &s;aw too clearly the cau&s;e of his
deten&s;ion, which he regarded as a &s;pecious impri&s;onment, and therefore
took every opportunity of &s;ecret|ly exciting the Ionians to a revolt, hoping,
that him&s;elf might one day be &s;ent to bring them to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tagoras was at that time this &s;tate&s;man's deputy at
Miletus, and received the in&s;truc|tions of his ma&s;ter to &s;tir up the
Ionian cities to revolt with the utmo&s;t alacrity. In fact, from a late
failure of this general upon Naxos, his credit was ruined at the Per&s;ian
court, and no other alternative remained for him but to comply with the advice
of Hi&s;tiaeus in &s;tirring up a revolt, and of trying to place him&s;elf at
the head of a new confederacy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep Ari&s;tagoras took to engage the affections of
the Ionians, was to throw up his power in Miletus, where he was deputy, 
<PB N="88" REF="91"> and to rein&s;tate that little place in all its former
freedom. He then made a journey through all Ionia, where, by his example, his
credit, and perhaps his menaces, he induced every other governor to imitate his
example. They all complied the more chearfully, as the Per&s;ian power &s;ince
the check it had received in Scy|thia, was the le&s;s able to puni&s;h their
revolt, or to protect them in their continued attachment. Having thus united
all the&s;e little &s;tates by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of one common offence,
he then threw off the ma&s;k, declaring him&s;elf at the head of the
confederacy, and bid defiance to the power of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>To enable him&s;elf to carry on the war with more vigour, he went in
the beginning of the following year to Lacedaemon, in order to en|gage that
&s;tate in his intere&s;ts, and engage it in a war with a power that &s;eemed
every day to threaten the general liberty of Greece. Cleo|menes was at that
time king of Sparta, and to him Ari&s;tagoras applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in
what he repre&s;ented as the common cau&s;e. He re|pre&s;ented to him, that the
Ionians and Lace|daemonians were countrymen; that it would be for the honour of
Sparta to concur with him in the de&s;ign he had formed of re&s;toring the
Ioni|ans to their liberty; that the Per&s;ians were <PB N="89" REF="92">
enervated by luxury; that their riches would &s;erve to reward the conquerors,
while nothing was &s;o ea&s;y as their overthrow. Con&s;idering the pre&s;ent
&s;pirit of the Ionians, it would not be difficult, he &s;aid, for the
victorious Spar|tans to carry their arms even to the gates of Su&s;a, the
metropolis of the Per&s;ian empire, and thus give laws to tho&s;e who
pre&s;umed to call them&s;elves the &s;overeigns of the world. Cleomenes
de&s;ired time to con&s;ider this pro|po&s;al; and, being bred up in Spartan
ignorance, demanded how far it was from the Ionian &s;ea to Su&s;a?
Ari&s;tagoras, without con&s;idering the tendency of the que&s;tion,
an&s;wered, that it might be a journey of three months. Cleome|nes made no
an&s;wer, but turning his back upon &s;o great an adventurer, gave orders that
before &s;un-&s;et he &s;hould quit the city. Still, however, Ari&s;tagoras
followed him to his hou&s;e, and finding the inefficacy of his eloquence, tried
what his offers of wealth could do. He at fir&s;t offered him ten talents, he
then rai&s;ed the &s;um to fifteen; and it is unknown what effect &s;uch a
large &s;um might have had upon the Spartan, had not his daughter, a child of
nine years old, who was accidentally pre&s;ent at the propo&s;al, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Fly father, or this &s;tranger will cor|rupt
you.</HI></Q> This advice given in the moment of <PB N="90" REF="93">
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, prevailed; Cleomenes refu&s;ed his bribes, and Ari&s;tagoras
went to &s;ue at other cities, where eloquence was more honoured, and wealth
more alluring.</P>
<P>Athens was a city where he expected a more favourable reception.
Nothing could be more fortunate for his intere&s;ts than his arrival at the
very time they had received the peremptory me&s;&s;age from the Per&s;ians to
admit their ty|rant, or to fear the con&s;equences of their di&s;|obedience.
The Athenians were at that time all in an uproar, and the propo&s;al of
Ari&s;tago|ras met with the mo&s;t favourable reception. It was much ea&s;ier
to impo&s;e upon a multitude than a &s;ingle per&s;on, the whole body of
citi|zens engaged immediately to furni&s;h twenty &s;hips to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
de&s;igns; and to the&s;e, the Eretrians and Eubaeans added five more.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tagoras, thus &s;upplied, re&s;olved to act with vigour, and
having collected all his forces together, &s;et &s;ail for Ephe&s;us; where,
leaving his fleet, he entered the Per&s;ian fron|tiers, and marched by land to
Sardis, the ca|pital city of Lydia. Artaphernes, who re&s;id|ed there as the
Per&s;ian viceroy, finding the city untenable, re&s;olved to &s;ecure him&s;elf
in the citadel, which he knew could not ea&s;ily be forced. As mo&s;t of the
hou&s;es of this city <PB N="91" REF="94"> were built with reeds, and
con&s;equently very combu&s;tible, one of the hou&s;es being &s;et on fire by
an Ionian &s;oldier, the flames quickly &s;pread to all the re&s;t. Thus the
whole town was quickly reduced to a&s;hes, and numbers of the inhabitants
&s;lain. But the Per&s;ians were &s;oon avenged for this unnece&s;&s;ary
cruelty, for either recovering them&s;elves from their former panic, or being
reinforced by the Lydians, they charg|ed the Ionians in a body, and drove them
back with great &s;laughter. Nor was the pur|&s;uit di&s;continued even as far
as Ephe&s;us, where the vanqui&s;hed and the victors arriving to|gether, a
great carnage en&s;ued, and but a &s;mall part of the routed army e&s;caped,
which took &s;helter aboard the fleet, or in the neigh|bouring cities. Other
defeats followed after this. The Athenians intimidated with &s;uch a
commencement of ill-&s;ucce&s;s, could not be per&s;uaded to continue the war.
The Cypri|ans were obliged once more to &s;ubmit to the Per&s;ian yoke. The
Ionians lo&s;t mo&s;t of their towns one after the other, and Ari&s;tagoras
fly|ing into Thrace, was cut off by the inhabitants with all his forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Hi&s;tiaeus, who was the original cau&s;e of all
the&s;e misfortunes, find|ing that he began to be &s;u&s;pected in Per&s;ia,
left <PB N="92" REF="95"> that court under a pretence of going to quell tho&s;e
troubles, which he had all along &s;ecretly fomented, but his duplicity of
conduct ren|dered him now &s;u&s;picious to either party. Artaphernes, the
Per&s;ian viceroy, plainly ac|cu&s;ed him of treachery, while his own
Mile&s;i|ans refu&s;ed to admit him as their ma&s;ter. Thus wavering,
uncertain, and not knowing where to turn, having picked up a few &s;cattered
re|mains of the routed armies, he fell in with Harpagus, one of the Per&s;ian
generals, who routed his forces, and made Hi&s;tiaeus him&s;elf a pri&s;oner.
Being &s;ent to Artaphernes, that inhuman commander immediately cau&s;ed him to
be crucified, and ordered his head to be &s;ent to Darius, who received the
pre&s;ent with that di&s;gu&s;t which evidenced his &s;uperior hu|manity. He
wept over it with a friendly &s;or|row, and ordered that it &s;hould receive
honour|able interment.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the affairs of the Ionian confederacy every day
became more de&s;perate. The Per&s;ian generals finding that Miletus was the
city which they chiefly depended on, re|&s;olved to march thither with all
their forces, concluding, that having carried that city, all the re&s;t would
&s;ubmit of cour&s;e. The Ionians having intelligence of this de&s;ign,
determined <PB N="93" REF="96"> in a general a&s;&s;embly, to make no
oppo&s;ition by land, where the Per&s;ians were too powerful; but to fortify
Miletus, and exert all their ef|forts by &s;ea, where they hoped for the
advan|tage from their &s;uperior &s;kill in naval evolu|tions. They accordingly
a&s;&s;embled a fleet of three hundred &s;hips at a little i&s;land over
again&s;t Miletus, and on the &s;uperiority of this fleet they placed their
whole reliance. But the Per&s;ian gold effected what their arms were un|able to
compa&s;s. Their emi&s;&s;aries having &s;e|cretly debauched the greate&s;t
part of the con|federates, and engaged them to de&s;ert; when the two fleets
came to engage, the &s;hips of Sa|mos, Le&s;bos, and &s;everal other places,
&s;ailed off, and returned to their own country. Thus the remaining part of the
fleet, which did not amount to more than an hundred &s;hips, was quickly
overpowered, and almo&s;t totally de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>After this the city of Miletus was be&s;ieged, and was ea&s;ily
taken. All the other cities, as well on the continent as among the i&s;lands,
were forced to return to their duty. Tho&s;e who continued ob&s;tinate were
treated with great &s;everity. The hand&s;ome&s;t of the young men were
cho&s;en to &s;erve in the king's palace, and the young women were all &s;ent
into Per|&s;ia. <PB N="94" REF="97"> Thus ended the revolt of the Ionians,
which continued &s;ix years from its fir&s;t break|ing out under Ari&s;tagoras,
and this was the third time the Ionians were obliged to undergo the yoke of
foreign dominion, for they inhe|rited a natural love of freedom, which all the
Greeks were known to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians having thus &s;ubdued the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia
Minor, began to look to|wards Europe, as offering conque&s;ts worthy their
ambition. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance given the Ioni|ans by the Athenian fleet, and
the refu&s;al of that &s;tate to admit Hippias as their king, the taking of
Sardis, and the contempt they te&s;tifi|ed for the Per&s;ian power, were all
&s;ufficient motives for exciting the re&s;entment of that empire, and for
marking out all Greece for de|&s;truction. Darius, therefore, in the
twenty-eighth year of his reign, having recalled all his other generals, &s;ent
Mardonius, the &s;on of Gobryas, a young nobleman who had lately married one of
the king's daughters, to com|mand in chief throughout all the maritime parts of
A&s;ia; and, particularly, to revenge the burning of Sardis. This was an
offence which that monarch &s;eemed peculiarly to re|&s;ent, and from the time
of that conflagration, he had given orders for one of his attendants 
<PB N="95" REF="98"> every time he &s;at down to table, to cry out, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>remember the Athenians.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mardonius, willing to &s;econd his ma&s;ter's animo&s;ity, quickly
pa&s;&s;ed into Thrace at the head of a large army, and &s;o terrified the
in|habitants of that country, that they yielded implicit obedience to his
power. From thence he &s;et &s;ail for Macedonia, but his fleet at|tempting to
double the Cape of Mount Athos, in order to gain the coa&s;ts of that country,
they were attacked by &s;o violent a tempe&s;t, that upwards of three hundred
&s;hips were &s;unk, and above twenty thou&s;and men peri&s;hed in the &s;ea.
His land army, that took the longe&s;t way about, met, at the &s;ame time, with
equal di&s;tre&s;&s;es. For being encamped in a place of no &s;ecurity, the
Thracians attacked them by night, and made a great &s;laughter among the enemy.
Mardonius him&s;elf was wounded, and finding his army unable to maintain the
field, he returned to the Per&s;ian court covered with grief and confu&s;ion,
having mi&s;carried both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>But the ill &s;ucce&s;s of one or two campaigns was not &s;ufficient
to abate the re&s;entment, or the ardour of the king of Per&s;ia.
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as he was of re&s;ources almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible, wealth
without end, and armies that &s;eemed <PB N="96" REF="99"> to encrea&s;e from
defeat, he only grew more determined from every repul&s;e, and doubled his
preparations in proportion to his former failures. He now perceived that the
youth and inexperience of Mardonius were unequal to &s;o great an undertaking,
he, therefore, di&s;|placed him, and appointed two generals, Da|tis, a Mede,
and Artaphernes, the &s;on of him who was late governor of Sardis, in his
&s;tead. His thoughts were earne&s;tly bent on attacking Greece with all his
forces; he wi&s;hed to take a &s;ignal revenge upon Athens, which he
con&s;idered as the principal caufe of the late revolt in Ionia: be&s;ides,
Hippias was &s;till near him to warm his ambition, and keep his re&s;entment
alive. Greece, he &s;aid, was now an object for &s;uch a conqueror; the world
had long beheld it with an eye of admiration, and if not &s;oon humbled, it
might in time &s;upplant even Per&s;ia in the homage of the world.</P>
<P>Thus excited by every motive of ambition and revenge, Darius
re&s;olved to bend all his attention to a war with Greece. He had in the
beginning of his reign &s;ent &s;pies with one Democedes, a Greek phy&s;ician,
as their con|ductor, to bring him information with re&s;pect to the &s;trength
and &s;ituation of all the &s;tates of Greece. This &s;ecret deputation failed;
he <PB N="97" REF="100"> was, therefore, willing once more to &s;end men under
the character of heralds, to denounce his re&s;entment; and, at the &s;ame
time, to learn how the different &s;tates of the country &s;tood affected
towards him. The form u&s;ed by the Per&s;ians, when they expected
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from le&s;&s;er &s;tates, was to demand earth and water in the
monarch's name, and &s;uch as refu&s;ed were to be con&s;idered as oppo&s;ers
of the Per|&s;ian power. On the arrival, therefore, of the heralds among&s;t
the Greeks, many of the ci|ties, dreading the Per&s;ian power, complied with
their demands. The Eginetans, with &s;ome of the i&s;lands al&s;o, yielded up a
ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and almo&s;t all but Athens and Sparta were contented
to exchange their liberties for &s;afety.</P>
<P>But the&s;e two noble republics bravely di&s;|dained to acknowledge
the Per&s;ian power; they had felt the benefits of freedom, and were re&s;olved
to maintain it to the la&s;t. In|&s;tead therefore of offering up earth and
water as demanded, they threw the heralds, the one into a well, the other into
a ditch, and adding mockery to in&s;ult, de&s;ired them to take earth and water
from thence. This they probably did to cut off all hopes of a reconciliation,
and to leave no &s;afety but in per&s;everance and de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101"> Nor were the Athenians content with this
outrage, but re&s;olved al&s;o to puni&s;h the Aegine|tans, who, by a ba&s;e
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Per&s;ian power, had betrayed the common cau&s;e of
Greece. They accordingly repre&s;ented the affair to the Spartans, with all its
aggravating circum&s;tances, and heightened with that elo|quence for which they
were famous. Before &s;uch judges it was not likely that cowardice or timidity
would find many defenders; the Spar|tans immediately gave judgment again&s;t
the people of Aegina, and &s;ent Cleomenes, one of their kings, to apprehend
the authors of &s;o ba&s;e a conce&s;&s;ion. The people of Aegina, how|ever,
refu&s;ed to deliver them, under pretence that Cleomenes came without his
colleague. This colleague was Demaratus, who had him&s;elf &s;ecretly
furni&s;hed them with that excu&s;e. As &s;oon as Cleomenes was returned to
Sparta, in order to be revenged on Demaratus for thus counteracting the demands
of his country, he endeavoured to get him depo&s;ed, as not being of the royal
family. In fact, Demaratus was born only &s;even months after marriage, and
this was &s;uppo&s;ed by many to be a &s;ufficient proof of his ba&s;tardy.
This accu&s;ation, there|fore, being revived, the Pythian oracle was appointed
to determine the controver&s;y; and <PB N="99" REF="102"> the prie&s;te&s;s
being privately &s;uborned by Cleomenes, an an&s;wer was given again&s;t his
colleague ju&s;t as he had dictated. Demaratus thus being declared
illegitimate, and unable to endure &s;o gro&s;s an injury, bani&s;hed him&s;elf
from his country, and retired to Darius, who received him with great
friend&s;hip, and gave him a con&s;iderable &s;ettlement in Per&s;ia. He was
&s;ucceeded in the throne by Leotychides, who concurring with the views of
Cleomenes, puni&s;hed the Aeginetans, by placing ten of their mo&s;t guilty
citizens in the hands of the Athenians; while Cleomenes, &s;ome time after,
being detected of having &s;uborned the prie&s;te&s;s, &s;lew him&s;elf in a
fit of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Aeginetans com|plained of the &s;everity of
their treatment, but finding no likelihood of redre&s;s, they re&s;olved to
obtain that ju&s;tice by force which was re|fu&s;ed to their &s;upplications.
Accordingly, they intercepted an Athenian &s;hip, which in pur&s;uance of an
annual cu&s;tom ever &s;ince the times of The&s;eus, was going to Delos to
offer &s;acrifice. This produced a naval war between the&s;e two &s;tates; in
which, after a variety of fortunes, the Aeginetans were wor&s;ted, and the
Athenians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;o|vereignty of the &s;eas.
Thus the&s;e civil di&s;|cords, <PB N="100" REF="103"> which &s;eemed at
fir&s;t to favour the de|&s;igns of the common enemy, turned out to the general
advantage of Greece. For the Athe|nians thus acquiring great power at &s;ea,
were put in a capacity of facing the Per&s;ian fleets, and of cutting off
tho&s;e &s;upplies which were continually carrying to their armies by land.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the preparations on both &s;ides for a general
war, were carried on with the greate&s;t animo&s;ity and di&s;patch. Da|rius
&s;ent away his generals, Datis and Arta|phernes, whom he had appointed in the
room of Mardonius, to what he &s;uppo&s;ed a certain conque&s;t. They were
furni&s;hed with a fleet of &s;ix hundred &s;hips, and an army of an hun|dred
and twenty thou&s;and men; their in|&s;tructions were, to give up Athens and
Eretria, a little city which had joined in the league again&s;t him, to be
plundered; to burn all the hou&s;es and temples of both, and to lead away all
the inhabitants into &s;lavery. The country was to be laid de&s;olate, and the
army was provided with a &s;ufficient &s;upply of chains and fetters for
binding the conquered na|tions.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e this formidable inva&s;ion, the Athenians had only their
courage, their animo+&s;ity, their dread of &s;lavery, their di&s;cipline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="101" REF="104"> and about ten
thou&s;and men. Their civil commotions with the other &s;tates of Greece had
given them a &s;pirit of war and &s;tratagem, while the genius of their
citizens, continually excited and exerci&s;ed, was arrived at its highe&s;t
pitch, and fitted them for every danger. Athens had long been refining in all
tho&s;e arts which qualifies a &s;tate to extend, or to enjoy conque&s;t; every
citizen was a &s;tate&s;man and a general, and every &s;oldier con&s;idered
him&s;elf as one of the bulwarks of his country. But in this little &s;tate,
from whence fir&s;t flowed all the&s;e im|provements that have &s;ince adorned
and ci|vilized &s;ociety, there was at that time three men who were
con&s;idered as &s;uperiors to all the re&s;t, all remarkable for their
abilities in war, and their integrity in peace, for tho&s;e qua|lifications
that can advance the glory of &s;tates, or procure the happine&s;s of the
individual.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Miltiades, as being the mo&s;t ex|perienced, was at that
time the mo&s;t known. He was the &s;on of Cimon, and nephew of Miltiades, an
illu&s;trious Athenian, who ac|cepted the government of the Dolonci, a people
of the Thracian Cher&s;one&s;us. Old Miltiades dying without i&s;&s;ue, he was
&s;ucceed|ed in his government by Ste&s;agoras his nephew, and he al&s;o dying,
young Militades was cho|&s;en <PB N="102" REF="105"> as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He
was appointed to that government the &s;ame year that Darius undertook his
un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition again&s;t the Scythians. He was obliged to attend
that prince as far as the I&s;ter with what &s;hipping he was able to &s;upply;
but ever eager to throw off the Per&s;ian yoke, it was he who advi&s;ed the
Ionians to de&s;troy the bridge, and leave the army of Darius to its fate. When
the affairs of the continent began to decline, Miltiades, rather than live in
dependence, re&s;olved to re|turn once more to Athens; and thither he re|turned
with five &s;hips, which were all that re|mained of his &s;hattered
fortunes.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, two other citizens, younger than Miltiades,
began to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves at Athens, namely, Ari&s;tides and
The|mi&s;tocles. The&s;e were of very different di&s;|po&s;itions; but from
this difference re&s;ulted the greate&s;t advantages to their country.
The|mi&s;tocles was naturally inclined to a popular government, and omitted
nothing that could render him agreeable to the people, or gain him friends. His
complai&s;ance was boundle&s;s, and his de&s;ire to oblige &s;ometimes
out-&s;tepped the bounds of duty. His partiality was often con&s;picuous.
Somebody talking with him once on the &s;ubject, told him he would make 
<PB N="103" REF="106"> an excellent magi&s;trate if he had more impar|tiality: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>God forbid, replied he, that I &s;hould ever
&s;it upon a tribunal where my friends &s;hould find no more favour than
&s;trangers.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ari&s;tides was as remarkable for his ju&s;tice and integrity. Being
a favourer of ari&s;tocracy, in imitation of Lycurgus, he was friendly, but
never at the expence of ju&s;tice. In &s;eeking honours, he ever declined the
intere&s;ts of his friends, le&s;t they &s;hould, in turn, demand his
intere&s;t when his duty was to be impartial. The love of the public good was
the great &s;pring of all his actions, and with that in view no difficulties
could daunt him, no &s;ucce&s;s or elevation exalt. On all occa&s;ions he
pre&s;erv|ed his u&s;ual calmne&s;s of temper, being per|&s;uaded that he was
entirely his country's, and very little his own. One day when an actor was
repeating &s;ome lines from Ae&s;chylus on the &s;tage, coming to a pa&s;&s;age
which de&s;crib|ed a man as not de&s;iring to appear hone&s;t, but to be &s;o,
the whole audience ca&s;t their eyes on Ari&s;tides, and applied the
pa&s;&s;age. In the admini&s;tration of public offices, his whole aim was to
perform his duty without any thought of enriching him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such were the characters of the illu&s;tri|ous Athenians that led
the councils of the <PB N="104" REF="107"> &s;tate when Darius turned his arms
again&s;t Greece. The&s;e in&s;pired their fellow-citizens with a noble
confidence in the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and made all the preparations
again&s;t the coming inva&s;ion that prudence and deli|berate valour could
&s;ugge&s;t. In the mean time, Datis and Artaphernes led on their nu|merous
forces towards Europe; and after hav|ing made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the
i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea without any oppo&s;ition, they turned their
cour&s;e towards Eretria, that city which had formerly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
Ionians in their revolt. The Eretrians, now driven to the la&s;t extremity,
&s;aw no hopes of meeting their enemy in the field, wherefore they &s;ent back
four thou&s;and men that the Athenians had &s;upplied them with, and re&s;olved
patient|ly to &s;tand a &s;iege. For &s;ix days the Per&s;ians at|tempted to
&s;torm the city, and were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s; but on the &s;eventh, the
city, by the treachery of &s;ome of the principal inhabitants, being betrayed
into their hands, they entered, plundered, and burned it. The inhabitants were
put in chains, and &s;ent as the fir&s;t fruits of war to the Per&s;ian
monarch; but he, contrary to their expectation, treated them with great lenity,
and gave them a village in the coun|try of Ci&s;&s;a for their re&s;idence,
where Apol|lonius <PB N="105" REF="108"> Tyanaeus found their de&s;cendants
&s;ix hundred years after.</P>
<P>After &s;uch &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s at Eretria, no|thing now
remained but the apparently ea&s;y conque&s;t of Greece. Hippias, the expelled
tyrant of Athens, &s;till accompanied the Per|&s;ian army, and led them by the
&s;afe&s;t marches into the heart of the country; at length, flu&s;hed with
victory and certain of &s;ucce&s;s, he conducted them to the plains of
Marathon, a fertile valley but ten miles di&s;tant from Athens. From thence
they &s;ent to &s;ummon the citizens, acquainting them with the fate of
Fretria, and informing them that not a &s;ingle inhabitant had e&s;caped their
vengeance. But the Athenians were not to be intimidated by any vicinity of
danger. They had &s;ent in|deed to Sparta to implore &s;uccours again&s;t the
common enemy, which were granted without deliberation; but the &s;uper&s;tition
of the times rendered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance ineffectual, for it was an
e&s;tabli&s;hed law among the Spartans not to begin a march before the full
moon. They applied al&s;o to other &s;tates, but they were too much awed by the
power of Per&s;ia to move in their defence. An army of an hundred and twenty
thou&s;and men, exulting in the mid&s;t of their country, was too formidable
for a <PB N="106" REF="109" MS="y"> weak and jealous confederacy to oppo&s;e.
The inhabitants of Platea alone furni&s;hed them with a thou&s;and &s;oldiers,
and they were left to find all other a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their courage and
their de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In this extremity they were obliged to arm their &s;laves for the
&s;afety of all, and their forces thus united amounted to but ten thou|&s;and
men. Hoping therefore to derive from their di&s;cipline what they wanted in
power, they placed their whole army under the con|duct of ten generals, of whom
Miltiades was chief, and the&s;e each was to have the com|mand of the troops
day about in regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. An arrangement in it&s;elf &s;o
unpro|mi&s;ing, was &s;till more embarra&s;&s;ed by the ge|nerals them&s;elves
di&s;puting whether they &s;hould hazard a battle, or wait the approach of the
enemy within their walls. The latter opinion &s;eemed for a while to prevail;
it was urged that it would be ra&s;hne&s;s it&s;elf to face &s;o pow|erful and
well appointed an army with an handful of men. It was alledged that the
&s;oldiers would gather courage from their &s;e|curity behind their walls, and
that the forces of Sparta without, might make a diver&s;ion in ca&s;e of a
&s;ally from within. Militades, how|ever, declared for the contrary opinion,
and <PB N="107" REF="110"> &s;hewed that the only means to exalt the cou|rage
of their own troops, and to &s;trike a ter|ror into tho&s;e of the enemy, was
to advance boldly toward them with an air of confidence and de&s;perate
intrepidity. Ari&s;tides al&s;o &s;tre|nuou&s;ly embraced this opinion, and
exerted all his ma&s;culine eloquence to bring over the re&s;t. The que&s;tion
being put, when the &s;uffrages came to be taken, the opinions were equal on
either &s;ide of the argument. It now there|fore remained with Callimachus, the
Polem|arch, who had a right of voting as well as the ten commanders, to give
his opinion and decide this important debate. It was to him Miltiades
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, alledging that the
fate of his coun|try was now in his power; that his &s;ingle vote was to
determine whether his country &s;hould be en&s;laved or free; that his fame
might now, by a &s;ingle word, be made equal to that of Harmodius and
Ari&s;togiton, who were the au|thors of Athenian liberty. Thus exhorted,
Callimachus did not long debate, but gave his voice in favour of an open
engagement; and Miltiades, thus &s;econded, prepared to mar&s;hal up his little
army for the great en|counter.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111"> In the mean time it appeared that &s;o many
leaders commanding in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, only &s;erved to perplex and counteract
each other. Ari|&s;tides perceived that a command which changes every day,
mu&s;t be incapable of projecting or executing any uniform de&s;ign; he
therefore gave it as his opinion that it was nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;t the
whole power in one &s;ingle per&s;on, and to induce his colleagues to conform,
he him&s;elf &s;et the fir&s;t example of re&s;ignation. When the day came on
which it was his turn to command, he re&s;igned it to Miltiades as the more
able and experienced general, while the other commanders, warmed by &s;o
ge|nerous a pre&s;erence followed his example.</P>
<P>Miltiades thus ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme com|mand, which was now the
po&s;t of highe&s;t danger, like an experienced general, endea|voured, by the
advantage of his ground, to make up for his deficiency in &s;trength and
numbers He was &s;en&s;ible that by extending his front to oppo&s;e the enemy,
he mu&s;t weaken it too much, and give their den&s;e body the advantage. He
therefore drew up his army at the foot of a mountain, &s;o that the enemy
&s;hould not &s;urround him or charge him in the rear. On the flanks on either
&s;ide he cau&s;ed large trees to be thrown, which were cut down 
<PB N="109" REF="112"> for that purpo&s;e, and the&s;e &s;erved to guard him
from the Per&s;ian cavalry, that generally wheeled on the flank in the heat of
an en|gagement.</P>
<P>Datis, on his &s;ide, was &s;en&s;ible of this ad|vantageous
di&s;po&s;ition, but relying on his &s;upe|riority of numbers, and unwilling to
wait till the Spartan reinforcements &s;hould arrive, he determined to engage.
And now was to be fought the fir&s;t great battle which the Greeks had ever
engaged in. It was not like any of their former civil conte&s;ts ari&s;ing from
jealou&s;y and terminating in an ea&s;y accommodation: it was a battle that was
to be decided with the greate&s;t monarch of the earth, with the mo&s;t
numerous army that had been hitherto &s;een in Europe. This was an engagement
that was to decide the liberty of Greece, and, what was of infinitely greater
moment, the future progre&s;s of refinement among mankind. Upon the event of
this battle depended the com|plexion which the manners of the We&s;t were
hereafter to a&s;&s;ume, whether they were to adopt A&s;iatic cu&s;toms with
their conquerors, or to go on in modelling them&s;elves upon Grecian
refinements, as was afterwards the ca&s;e. This there&s;ore may be con&s;idered
as one of the mo&s;t important battles that ever <PB N="110" REF="113"> was
fought, and the event was as little to be expected as the &s;ucce&s;s was
glorious.</P>
<P>The &s;ignal was no &s;ooner given than the Athenians, without
waiting the Per&s;ian on&s;et, ru&s;hed in upon their ranks with de&s;perate
ra|pidity, as if wholly regardle&s;s of &s;afety. The Per&s;ians regarded this
fir&s;t &s;tep of the Athe|nians as the re&s;ult of madne&s;s, and were more
inclined to de&s;pi&s;e them as maniacs, than op|po&s;e them as &s;oldiers.
However, they were quickly undeceived. It had never before been the cu&s;tom of
the Greeks to run on with this headlong valour; but comparing the number of
their own forces with that of the enemy, and expecting &s;afety only from
ra&s;hne&s;s, they determined to break through the enemies ranks or fall in the
attempt. The greatne&s;s of their danger added to their courage, and de&s;pair
did the re&s;t. The Per&s;ians, however, &s;tood their ground with great
intrepidity, and the battle was long, fierce, and ob&s;tinate. Mil|tiades had
made the wings of his army ex|ceeding &s;trong, but had left the main body more
weak and not &s;o deep, for having but ten thou&s;and men to oppo&s;e to &s;uch
a nu|merous army, he &s;uppo&s;ed the victory could be obtained by no other
means than &s;trength|ening his flanks, not doubting but when his 
<PB N="111" REF="114"> wings were once victorious, they would be able to wheel
upon the enemies main body on ei|ther &s;ide, and thus put them ea&s;ily to the
rout. The Per&s;ians, therefore, finding the main body weake&s;t, attacked it
with their ut|mo&s;t vigour. It was in vain that Ari&s;tides and
Themi&s;tocles, who were &s;tationed in this po&s;t of danger, endeavoured to
keep their troops to the charge. Courage and intrepidity were unable to
re&s;i&s;t the torrent of encrea&s;ing numbers, &s;o that they were at la&s;t
obliged to give ground. But in the mean time the wings were victorious, and
now, ju&s;t as the main body was fainting under the unequal encounter, the&s;e
came up and gave them time to recover their &s;trength and order. Thus the
&s;cale of victory quickly began to turn in their favour, and the Per&s;ians,
from being the aggre&s;&s;ors, now began to give ground in turn, and being
un&s;upported by fre&s;h forces, they fled to their &s;hips with the utmo&s;t
precipitation. The con|fu&s;ion and di&s;order was now univer&s;al, the
Athenians followed them to the beach and &s;at many of their &s;hips on fire.
On this occa&s;ion it was that Cyndaeyrus, the brother of the poet Ae&s;chylus,
&s;eized with his hand one of the &s;hips that the enemy was pu&s;hing off from
the &s;hore. The Per&s;ians, within &s;eeing them|&s;elves 
<PB N="112" REF="115"> thus arre&s;ted, cut off his right hand that held the
prow, he then laid hold of it with his left, which they al&s;o cut off, at
la&s;t he &s;eized it with his teeth, and in that manner expired.</P>
<P>Seven of the enemies &s;hips were taken, above &s;ix thou&s;and
Per&s;ians were &s;lain, without rec|koning tho&s;e who were drowned in the
&s;ea as they endeavoured to e&s;cape, or tho&s;e who were con&s;umed when the
&s;hips were &s;et on fire. Of the Greeks not above two hundred men were
killed, among whom was Callimachus, who gave his vote for bringing on the
engagement. Hippias, who was the chief incendiary of the war, is al&s;o thought
to have fallen in this battle, though &s;ome &s;ay he e&s;caped and died
mi&s;erably at Lemnos.</P>
<P>Such was the famous battle of Marathon, which the Per&s;ians were
&s;o &s;ure of gaining, that they had brought marble into the field in order to
erect a trophy there. Ju&s;t after the battle an Athenian &s;oldier, who&s;e
name was Eucles, &s;till covered all over with blood and wounds, quitted the
army and ran to Athens to carry his fellow-citizens the news of the victory.
His &s;trength ju&s;t &s;ufficed to reach the city, and throwing him&s;elf into
the door of the fir&s;t hou&s;e he met, he uttered three <PB N="113" REF="116">
words, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Rejoice, we triumph,</HI></Q> and in&s;tantly
ex|pired.</P>
<P>While a part of the army marched forward to Athens, to protect it
from the attempts of the enemy, Ari&s;tides remained upon the field of battle
to guard the &s;poil and the pri&s;oners; and although gold and &s;ilver were
&s;cattered about the enemy's de&s;erted camp in abundance, though their tents
and gallies were full of rich furniture and &s;umptuous apparel, he would not
permit any of it to be embezzled, but re&s;erved it as a common reward for all
who had any &s;hare in obtaining the victory. Two thou&s;and Spartans al&s;o,
who&s;e laws would not permit them to march until the full of the moon, now
came into the field, but the action being over the day before, they only had an
opportunity of paying due honours to tho&s;e who gained &s;o glorious a
victory, and to bring back the news to Sparta. Of the marble which the
Per&s;ians had brought with them, the Athenians made a trophy, being carved by
Phidias into a &s;tatue, in honour of the godde&s;s Neme&s;is, who had a temple
near the field of battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Per&s;ian fleet, in&s;tead of &s;ailing
directly back to A&s;ia, made an attempt to &s;urpri&s;e Athens before the
Greek forces could arrive from Marathon. But the latter <PB N="114" REF="117">
had the precaution to move directly thither, and performed their march with
&s;o much ex|pedition, that though it was forty miles from Marathon, they
arrived there in one day. In this manner the Greeks not only repelled their
enemies, but confirmed their &s;ecurity. By this victory the Grecians were
taught to know their own &s;trength, and not to tremble before an ene|my
terrible only in name. This taught them through the whole of &s;ucceeding ages
to imi|tate their ance&s;tors with an ardent emulation, and in&s;pired them
with a wi&s;h of not degene|rating from the Grecian glory. Tho&s;e Athe|nians
that were &s;lain in battle had all the ho|nour immediately paid them that was
due to their merit. Illu&s;trious monuments were erect|ed to them all in the
very place where the bat|tle was fought, upon which their names, and the tribe
to which they belonged, were in&s;crib|ed. There were three di&s;tinct &s;ets
of monu|ments &s;et up; one for the Athenians, one for the Plataeans, and a
third for the &s;laves who had been enrolled into their troops upon that urgent
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But their gratitude to Miltiades &s;poke a noblene&s;s of mind, that
far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed expen&s;ive triumphs, or ba&s;e adulation. Sen&s;ible that
his merits were too great for money to repay, <PB N="115" REF="118"> they
cau&s;ed a picture to be painted by Po|lygnotus, one of their mo&s;t celebrated
arti&s;ts, where Miltiades was repre&s;ented at the head of the ten commanders
exhorting the &s;oldiers, and &s;etting them an example of their duty. This
picture was pre&s;erved for many ages, with other paintings of the be&s;t
ma&s;ters, in the por|tico where Zeno afterwards in&s;tituted his &s;chool of
philo&s;ophy. An emulation &s;eemed to take place in every rank of life;
Polygnotus valued him&s;elf &s;o much upon the honour of being ap|pointed to
paint this picture, that he gave his labour for nothing. In return for &s;uch
genero|&s;ity, the Amphyctions appointed him a pub|lic lodging in the city
where he might re&s;ide during plea&s;ure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.
3514.</NOTE></P>
<P>But though the gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades was very
&s;incere, yet was it of no long continuance. This fickle and jealous people,
naturally capricious, and now more than ever careful of pre&s;erving their
freedom, were willing to take every opportunity of mor|tifying a general, from
who&s;e merit they had much to fear. Being appointed with &s;eventy &s;hips to
puni&s;h tho&s;e i&s;lands that had favoured the Per&s;ian inva&s;ion, and
having rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Paros, upon a fal&s;e report of the arri|val of
the enemy's fleet, he returned un&s;ucce&s;s|fully <PB N="116" REF="119"> to
Athens, where he was accu&s;ed by one Xanthippus, of having taken a bribe from
Per|&s;ia. As he was not in a condition to an&s;wer this charge, being confined
to his bed by a fall he received at Paros; the accu&s;ation took place
again&s;t him, and he was condemned to lo&s;e his life. The manner of executing
cri|minals found guilty of great offences, was by throwing them into the
Barathrum, a deep pit, from whence none were ever &s;een to return. This
&s;entence was pronounced again&s;t him, but his former &s;ervices were &s;uch,
as to have this puni&s;hment commuted into a penalty of fifty talents, the
&s;um which it had co&s;t the &s;tate in fitting out the late un&s;ucce&s;sful
expedi|tion. Not being rich enough to pay this &s;um, he was thrown into
pri&s;on, where the brui&s;e on his thigh growing wor&s;e, from bad air and
confine|ment, it turned at la&s;t to a gangrene, and put an end to his life and
misfortunes.</P>
<P>Cimon, his &s;on, who was at this time very young, &s;ignalized his
piety on this occa&s;ion. As this ungrateful city would not permit the body of
Miltiades to be buried until all his debts were paid, this young man employed
all his intere&s;t among his friends, and &s;trained his ut|mo&s;t credit to
pay the fine, and procured his fa|ther's body an honourable interment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. From the Death of MILTIADES to the Retreat of XERXES
out of Greece.</HEAD>
<P>THE misfortunes of Darius only &s;erved to encrea&s;e his
re&s;entment, and give &s;pirit to his per&s;everance. Finding the ill
&s;ucce&s;s of his generals, he re&s;olved to try the war in per&s;on, and
di&s;patched orders throughout his whole dominions for fre&s;h preparations.
However, a revolt in Egypt for a while averted his re&s;ent|ment, a conte&s;t
among his &s;ons about nominat|ing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;till farther retarded
his de|&s;igns; and, at la&s;t, when he had &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle, and
was ju&s;t preparing to take a &s;ignal vengeance, his death put an end to all
his projects, and gave Greece a longer time for preparation.</P>
<P>Xerxes, his &s;on, &s;ucceeded, who, with the empire, inherited
al&s;o his father's animo&s;ity again&s;t Greece. Having carried on a
&s;ucce&s;s|ful expedition again&s;t Egypt, he expected the &s;ame good fortune
in Europe. Confident of victory, he did not chu&s;e, he &s;aid, for the fu|ture
<PB N="118" REF="121"> to buy the figs of Attica; he would po&s;&s;e&s;s
him&s;elf of the country, and thus have figs of his own. But, before he engaged
in an enter|prize of that importance, he thought proper to a&s;&s;emble his
council, and collect the opi|nions of the principal officers of his court. In
his &s;peech at opening the council, he evidently &s;hewed his de&s;ire of
revenge, and his pa&s;&s;ion for military glory. The be&s;t way, therefore, to
pay court to this young monarch, was by flattering him in his favourite
pur&s;uits, and giving his impetuous aims the air of &s;tudied de&s;igns.
Mardonius, grown neither wi&s;er nor le&s;s ambitious by his own bad
&s;ucce&s;s, be|gan by extolling Xerxes above all other kings that had gone
before. He urged the indi&s;|pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of avenging the
di&s;honour done to the Per&s;ian name; he repre&s;ented the Greeks as cowards,
that were accidently &s;uc|ce&s;sful, and was firmly of opinion, that they
would never more &s;tand even the hazard of a battle. A di&s;cour&s;e that &s;o
nearly conincided with his own &s;entiments, was very plea&s;ing to the young
monarch, and the re&s;t of the com|pany by their looks, and their &s;ilence,
&s;eemed to applaud his impetuo&s;ity. But Artabanus, the king's uncle, who had
long learned to re|verence courage even in an enemy, and pre&s;um|ing 
<PB N="119" REF="122"> upon his age and experience, to &s;peak his real
&s;entiments, ro&s;e with an hone&s;t freedom to repre&s;ent the intended
expedition in its true light. 
<Q REND="inline">"Permit me, &s;ir, &s;aid he, to deliver my
&s;entiments upon this occa&s;ion with a liberty &s;uitable to my age and your
intere&s;t. When Darius, your father, and my brother, fir&s;t thought of making
war again&s;t the Scythi|ans, I u&s;ed all my endeavours to divert him from it.
The people you are going to at|tack are infinitely more formidable than they.
If the Athenians alone could defeat the numerous army commanded by Datis and
Artaphernes, what ought we to expect from an oppo&s;ition of all the &s;tates
of Greece united? You de&s;ign to pa&s;s from A&s;ia into Europe, by laying a
bridge over the &s;ea. But what if the Athenians &s;hould advance and de&s;troy
this bridge, and &s;o prevent our return? Let us not expo&s;e our&s;elves to
&s;uch dangers, as we have no &s;ufficient motives to compel us to face them;
at lea&s;t let us take time to reflect upon it. When we have ma|turely
deliberated upon an affair, whatever happens to be the &s;ucce&s;s of it, we
have no|thing to regret. Precipitation is imprudent, and is u&s;ually
un&s;ucce&s;sful. Above all, do not &s;uffer your&s;elf, great prince, to be
dazzled <PB N="120" REF="123"> with the &s;plendor of imaginary glory. The
highe&s;t and the mo&s;t lofty trees have the mo&s;t rea&s;on to dread the
thunder. God loves to humble the o&s;tentatious, and re&s;erves to him|&s;elf
alone the pride of importance. As for you, Mardonius, who &s;o earne&s;tly urge
this expedition, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, lead it forward. But let the king,
who&s;e life is dear to us all, return back to Per&s;ia. In the mean time, let
your children and mine be given up as a pledge to an&s;wer for the &s;ucce&s;s
of the war. If the i&s;&s;ue be favourable, I con&s;ent that mine be put to
death, but if it prove other|wi&s;e, as I well fore&s;ee, then I de&s;ire that
you and your children may meet the reward of ra&s;hne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>This advice, which was rather &s;incere than palatable, was received
by Xerxes with a de|gree of rage and re&s;entment. 
<Q REND="inline">"Thank the Gods, cried he, that thou art my father's
brother; were it not for that thou &s;hould&s;t this moment meet the ju&s;t
reward of thy au|dacious behaviour. But you &s;hall have your puni&s;hment;
remain here behind among the women; the&s;e you but too much re&s;emble in your
cowardice and fear. Stay here while I march at the head of my troops where my
duty and glory call me."</Q> Upon cooler <PB N="121" REF="124"> thoughts,
however, Xerxes &s;eemed better re|conciled to his uncle's opinion. When the
fir&s;t emotions of his anger were over, and he had time to reflect on his
pillow upon the different coun&s;els that were given him, he confe&s;&s;ed the
ra&s;hne&s;s of his former rebuke, and ingenuou&s;ly a&s;cribed it to heat of
youth and the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. He offered to come over to his opinion, at
the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring the council, that from his dreams he had every
encouragement to proceed with the expedition. So much conde&s;cen&s;ion on the
one hand, and &s;uch favourable omens on the other, deter|mined the whole
council to &s;econd his incli|nations. They fell pro&s;trate before him, eager
to &s;hew their &s;ubm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion and
their joy. A mon|arch thus &s;urrounded by flatterers, all &s;triving which
&s;hould mo&s;t gratify his pride and pa&s;|&s;ions, could not long continue
good, though naturally inclined to virtue. Xerxes therefore &s;eems a character
thus ruined by power, ex|erting his natural ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom at &s;hort
intervals, but then giving way to the mo&s;t culpable and extravagant
exce&s;&s;es. Thus the coun&s;el of Arrabanes being rejected, and that of
Mardonius favourably received, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive preparations were made
for carrying on the war.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125"> The greatne&s;s of the&s;e preparations
&s;eemed to &s;hew the high &s;en&s;e which the Per&s;ians had of their enemy.
Xerxes, that he might omit nothing conducive to &s;ucce&s;s, entered into an
alliance with the Carthaginians, who were, at that time, the mo&s;t potent
people of the We&s;t; with whom it was &s;tipulated, that while the Per&s;ian
forces &s;hould attack Greece, the Car|thaginians &s;hould awe the Greek
colonies, di&s;|per&s;ed over the Mediterranean, from coming to their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus having drained all the Ea&s;t to compo&s;e his own army,
and the We&s;t to &s;upply that of the Carthaginians under Amilcar, he &s;et
out from Su&s;a in order to en|ter upon this war, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3523.</NOTE> ten years after the battle of
Marathon.</P>
<P>Sardis was the place where the various na|tions that were compelled
to his banner were to a&s;&s;emble. His fleet was to advance along the coa&s;ts
of A&s;ia Minor towards the Hel|le&s;pont. But as in doubling the cape of Mount
Athos many &s;hipwrecks were &s;u&s;tained, he was re&s;olved to cut a
pa&s;&s;age through that neck of land which joined the mountain to the
con|tinent, and thus give his &s;hipping a &s;horter and &s;afer pa&s;&s;age.
This canal was a mile and a half long, and hollowed out from a high mountain;
it required immen&s;e labour to per|form <PB N="123" REF="126"> &s;o great a
work, but his numbers and his ambition were &s;ufficient to &s;urmount all
difficulties. To urge on the undertaking the fa&s;ter, he treated his labourers
with the greate&s;t &s;everity, while with all the o&s;tentation of an
Ea&s;tern prince he gave his commands to the mountain to &s;ink before him: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Athos, thou proud a&s;piring mountain, that
lifte&s;t up thy head unto the heavens, be not &s;o audacious as to put
ob|&s;tacles in my way. If thou give&s;t them that op|po&s;ition, I will cut
thee level to the plain, and throw thee headlong into the &s;ea.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As this monarch pa&s;&s;ed on in his march to the place of general
de&s;tination, he went through Cappadocia, cro&s;&s;ed the river Halys, and
came to Calene, a city of Phrygia, near the &s;ource of the river Meander. He
was there met by Pythias, a Lydian prince, who, by the mo&s;t extreme
par&s;imony and oppre&s;&s;ion, had become, next to Xerxes, the mo&s;t opulent
man in all the Per&s;ian empire. His trea&s;ures, however, were not
&s;ufficient to buy off the at|tendance of his elde&s;t &s;on, whom he
reque&s;ted might be permitted to remain with him, as he was old and
helple&s;s. He had before offered his money, which amounted to about four
millions &s;terling, for the monarch's u&s;e; but this Xerxes had refu&s;ed,
and now, finding the <PB N="124" REF="127"> young prince willing to remain with
his father, he was &s;o enraged that he commanded him to be put to death before
his father's eyes. Then cau&s;ing the dead body to be cut in two, and one part
of it to be placed on the right, and the other on the left, he made the whole
army pa&s;s between them to terrify them from a re|luctance to engage by his
example.</P>
<P>From Phrygia Xerxes marched to Sardis, and, in the opening of
&s;pring, directed his march down towards the Helle&s;pont, where his fleet lay
in all their pomp, expecting his ar|rival. Here being arrived, he was
de&s;irous of taking a &s;urvey of all his forces, which com|po&s;ed an army
which was never equalled either before or &s;ince. It was compo&s;ed of the
mo&s;t powerful nations of the Ea&s;t, and of people &s;carce known to
po&s;terity except by name. The remote&s;t India contributed its &s;upplies,
while the colde&s;t tracts of Scythia &s;ent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Medes,
Per&s;ians, Bactrians, Ly|dians, A&s;&s;yrians, Hyrcanians, and an hundred
other countries of various forms, complexions, languages, dre&s;&s;es, and
arms. The land army, which he brought out of A&s;ia, con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and foot, and four|&s;core thou&s;and hor&s;e. Three
hundred thou&s;and more that were added upon cro&s;&s;ing the Hel|le&s;pont, 
<PB N="125" REF="128"> made all his land forces together amount to above two
millions of men. His fleet when it &s;et out from A&s;ia, con&s;i&s;ted of
twelve hundred and &s;even ve&s;&s;els, each carry|ing two hundred men. The
Europeans aug|mented his fleet with an hundred and twenty ve&s;&s;els, each of
which carried two hundred men. Be&s;ides the&s;e there were two thou&s;and
&s;maller ve&s;&s;els fitted for carrying provi&s;ions and &s;tores; the men
contained in the&s;e, with the former, amounted to &s;ix hundred thou|&s;and,
&s;o that the whole army might be &s;aid to amount to two millions and an half,
which, with the women, &s;laves, and futtlers, always accompanying a Per&s;ian
army, might make the whole above five mil|lions of &s;ouls: a number, if
rightly con|ducted, capable of overturning the greate&s;t monarchy, but being
commanded by pre|&s;umption and ignorance, they only &s;erved to ob&s;truct and
embarra&s;s each other.</P>
<P>Lord of &s;o many and &s;uch various &s;ubjects, Xerxes found a
plea&s;ure in reviewing his forces, and was de&s;irous of beholding a naval
engagement, of which he had not hitherto been a &s;pectator. To this end a
throne was erected for him upon an eminence, and in that &s;ituation beholding
all the earth covered <PB N="126" REF="129"> with his troops, and all the &s;ea
crowded with his ve&s;&s;els, he felt a &s;ecret joy diffu&s;e it&s;elf through
his frame from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;uperior power. But all the
workings of this monarch's mind were in extreme, a &s;udden &s;adne&s;s &s;oon
took place of his plea|&s;ure, and di&s;&s;olving in a &s;hower of tears, he
gave him&s;elf up to a reflection that not one of &s;o many thou&s;and would be
alive a hundred years after.</P>
<P>Artabanus, who neglected no opportunity of moralizing upon every
occurrence, took this occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e with him upon the
&s;hortne&s;s and mi&s;eries of human life. Finding this more di&s;tant
&s;ubject attended to, he &s;poke more clo&s;ely to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion,
in&s;inuated his doubts of the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition; urged the many
inconveniencies the army had to &s;uffer, if not from the enemy, at lea&s;t
from their own numbers. He alledged, that plagues, famine, and confu&s;ion,
were the nece&s;&s;ary at|tendants of &s;uch ungovernable multitudes by land,
and that empty fame was the only re|ward of &s;ucce&s;s. But it was now too
late to turn this young monarch from his purpo&s;e. Xerxes informed his monitor
that great actions were always attended with proportionable dan|ger, and that
if his predece&s;&s;ors had ob&s;erved &s;uch <PB N="127" REF="130">
&s;crupulous and timorous rules of conduct, the Per&s;ian empire would never
have attained to its pre&s;ent height of glory.</P>
<P>Xerxes, in the mean time, had given or|ders for building a bridge of
boats acro&s;s the Helle&s;pont for the tran&s;porting his army into Europe.
This narrow &s;treight, which now goes by the name of the Dardanels, is near an
Engli&s;h mile over. But &s;oon after the com|pletion of this work, a violent
&s;torm ari&s;ing, the whole was broken and de&s;troyed, and the labour was to
be undertaken anew. The fury of Xerxes upon this di&s;appointment was at|tended
with equal extravagance and cruelty. His vengeance knew no bounds; the work|men
who had undertaken the ta&s;k, had their heads &s;truck off by his order; and
that the &s;ea it&s;elf al&s;o might know its duty, he or|dered it to be
la&s;hed as a delinquent, and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it to curb
its fu|ture irregularities. Thus having given vent to his ab&s;urd
re&s;entment, two bridges were or|dered to be built in the place of the former,
one for the army to pa&s;s over, and the other for the baggage and the bea&s;ts
of burthen. The workmen, now warned by the fate of their predece&s;&s;ors,
undertook to give their la|bours greater &s;tability, they placed three
hun|dred <PB N="128" REF="131"> and &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els acro&s;s the
&s;treight, &s;ome of them having three banks of oars, and others fifty oars a
piece. They then ca&s;t large anchors into the water on both &s;ides, in order
to fix the&s;e ve&s;&s;els again&s;t the vio|lence of the winds, and the
current. They then drove large piles into the earth, with huge rings fa&s;tened
to them, to which were tied &s;ix va&s;t cables which went over each of the two
bridges. Over all the&s;e they laid trunks of trees, cut purpo&s;ely for that
u&s;e, and flat boats again over them fa&s;tened and joined together, &s;o as
to &s;erve for a floor or &s;olid bottom. When the whole work was thus
completed, a day was appointed for their pa&s;&s;|ing over, and as &s;oon as
the fir&s;t rays of the &s;un began to appear, &s;weet odours of all kinds were
abundantly &s;cattered over the new work, and the way was &s;trewed with
myrtle. At the &s;ame time Xerxes poured out libations into the &s;ea, and
turning his face towards the Ea&s;t, wor&s;hipped that bright luminary which is
the god of the Per&s;ians. Then, throwing the ve&s;&s;el which had held his
libation into the &s;ea, together with a golden cup and Per&s;ian &s;cymetar,
he went forward and gave orders for the army to follow. This immen&s;e train
were no le&s;s than &s;even days and &s;even nights <PB N="129" REF="132">
pa&s;&s;ing over, while tho&s;e who were appointed to conduct the march
quickened the troops by la&s;hing them along, for the &s;oldiers of the Ea&s;t,
at that time and to this very day, are treated like &s;laves.</P>
<P>Thus this immen&s;e army having landed in Europe, and being joined
by the &s;everal na|tions of Europe that acknowledged the Per&s;ian power,
Xerxes prepared for marching directly forward into Greece. Be&s;ide the
generals of every nation, who each of them commanded the troops of their
re&s;pective countries, the land army was commanded by &s;ix Per&s;ian
ge|nerals, to whom all the re&s;t were &s;ubordinate. The&s;e were Mardonius,
Tirintatechmus, Smer|donus, Ma&s;&s;i&s;tus, Gergis, and Megabyzus. Ten
thou&s;and Per&s;ians, who were called the Immortal Band, were commanded by
Hy|darnes, while the cavalry and the fleet had their own re&s;pective
commanders. Be&s;ide tho&s;e who were attached to Xerxes from prin|ciple, there
were &s;ome Greek princes, who, either from motives of intere&s;t or fear,
fol|lowed him in this expedition. Among the&s;e were Artemi&s;ia, queen of
Hallicarna&s;&s;us, who, after the death of her hu&s;band, governed the kingdom
for her &s;on. She had brought in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eed but the trifling &s;uccour of five &s;hips, but 
<PB N="130" REF="133"> &s;he had made ample amends by her &s;uperior prudence,
courage, and conduct. Of this number al&s;o was Demaratus, the exiled king of
Sparta, who, re&s;enting the indignity put upon him by his &s;ubjects, took
refuge in the Per&s;ian court, an indignant &s;pectator of its luxuries and
&s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Being one day a&s;ked by Xerxes if he thought the
Gre|cians would dare to await his approach, or would venture an engagement with
armies that drank up whole rivers in their march. 
<Q REND="inline">Alas, great prince, cried Demaratus, Greece, from
the beginning of time, has been trained up and accu&s;tomed to poverty; but the
defects of that are amply recompen&s;ed by virtue, which wi&s;dom cultivates,
and the laws &s;upport in vigour. As for the Lacedaemonians, as they have been
bred up in freedom, they can never &s;ubmit to be &s;laves. Though all the
re&s;t of the Greeks &s;hould for&s;ake them, though they &s;hould be reduced
to a band of a thou|&s;and man, yet &s;till they would face every dan|ger to
pre&s;erve what they hold dearer than life. They have laws which they obey with
more implicit reverence than your &s;ubjects are obeyed by you. By the&s;e laws
they are forbid to fly in battle, and they have only the alternative to conquer
or to die."</Q> Xerxes was not offended <PB N="131" REF="134"> with the liberty
of Demaratus, but, &s;miling at his blunt &s;incerity, ordered his army to
march forward, while he had directed his fleet to follow him along the coa&s;t,
and to regulate their cour&s;e by his motions.</P>
<P>In this manner he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e with|out any interruption,
every nation near which he approached &s;ending him all the marks of homage and
&s;ubjection. Wherever he came he found provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments
prepared before-hand, pur&s;uant to the orders he had given. Every city he
arrived at, exhau&s;ted it&s;elf in giving him the mo&s;t magnificent
re|ception. The va&s;t expence of the&s;e fea&s;ts gave a poor Thracian an
opportunity of re|marking, that it was a peculiar favour of the gods that
Xerxes could eat but one meal a day. Thus did he continue his march through
Thrace, Macedonia, and The&s;&s;aly, every knee bending before him till he came
to the &s;treights of Thermopylae, where he fir&s;t found an army prepared to
di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>This army was a body of Spartans, led on by Leonidas their king, who
had been &s;ent thither to oppo&s;e him. As &s;oon as it was known in Greece
that Xerxes was preparing to invade that country, and that an army of millions
were coming on with determined re|&s;olution <PB N="132" REF="135"> to ruin it,
every &s;tate &s;eemed dif|ferently affected in proportion to its &s;trength,
its courage, or its &s;ituation. The Sicilians re|fu&s;ed their aid, being kept
in awe by Amilcar the Carthaginian. The Corcyreans pretended that they were
wind-bound, and would not let their &s;hips &s;tir from the harbour. The
Cre|tans, having con&s;ulted the Delphic oracle, ab|&s;olutely determined to
remain inactive. The The&s;&s;alians and Macedonians, from their &s;itu|ation,
were obliged to &s;ubmit to the conqueror, &s;o that no &s;tates were found
bold enough to face this formidable army but Athens and Lacedaemon. The&s;e
&s;tates had received intel|ligence of the Per&s;ian de&s;igns from Demara|tus,
long before they had been put into ex|ecution. They had al&s;o &s;ent &s;pies
to Sardis, in order to have a more exact information of the number and quality
of the enemy's forces. The &s;pies indeed were &s;eized, but Xerxes or|dered
them to be conducted through his army, and to give an exact account of what
they had &s;een at their return. They had &s;ent deputies to all the
neighbouring &s;tates to awaken their ardour, to appri&s;e them of their
danger, and to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting for their com|mon &s;afety.
But all their remon&s;trances were vain; fear, a&s;&s;uming the name of
prudence, <PB N="133" REF="136"> offered frivolous excu&s;es, or terms which
were inadmi&s;&s;ible. Relying therefore on their own &s;trength, the&s;e
generous &s;tates re&s;olved to face the danger with joint forces, and conquer
or fall in the cau&s;e of freedom. Having &s;um|moned a general council at the
I&s;thmus, they there &s;olemnly re&s;olved to wave all private quarrels or
preten&s;ions, and join again&s;t the common danger.</P>
<P>One cannot, without a&s;toni&s;hment, reflect on the intrepidity of
the Greeks, who deter|mined to face the innumerable army of Xerxes with &s;uch
di&s;proportioned forces. All their forces joined together amounted only to
eleven thou&s;and two hundred men. But they were all &s;oldiers, bred amid&s;t
fatigue and danger, all determined to a man either to conquer or die. Their
fir&s;t care, however, was to appoint a general. It was then that the mo&s;t
able and experienced captains, terrified at the danger' had taken the
re&s;olution of not pre&s;enting them&s;elves as candidates. Epicydes indeed, a
man of ignorance, avarice, and pre&s;umption, was ready to lead them on, and,
under his guidance, nothing could be hoped for but confu&s;ion and
di&s;appointment. In this pre&s;&s;ing juncture, therefore, Themi&s;tocles,
con&s;cious of his own capacity, and warmed with a love <PB N="134" REF="137">
of glory, which was great in proportion to the danger, re&s;olved to u&s;e
every art to get him|&s;elf appointed to the command. For this purpo&s;e he
u&s;ed all his intere&s;t, and even di&s;|tributed bribes to remove his
competitor, and having gratified the avarice of Epycides, which was his ruling
pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;oon found him&s;elf appointed to the command, which was the
darl|ing object of his ambition.</P>
<P>But in this pre&s;&s;ing exigence it was incum|bent on the Athenians
to avail them&s;elves of every per&s;on that might be &s;erviceable, how|ever
obnoxious he might appear to their re|&s;entment. There were many u&s;eful
citizens whom they had, upon &s;ome factious di&s;con|tents, &s;ent into
bani&s;hment, and the&s;e they now repentingly wi&s;hed to re&s;tore. Among
this number was Ari&s;tides, that brave and ju&s;t man, who had, at the battle
of Marathon, and upon other occa&s;ions, been in&s;trumental in gaining their
victories, and who had, upon all occa&s;ions, improved them by the
di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s and integrity of his example. This magi&s;trate having
had many conte&s;ts with Themi&s;tocles, who was his rival in power and &s;ame,
and always wi&s;hed to &s;upplant him, was at length condemned to go into
bani&s;hment by the power of his prevailing faction. It was on 
<PB N="135" REF="138"> that occa&s;ion that a pea&s;ant, who could not write,
and did not know Ari&s;tides per&s;onally, applied to him&s;elf, and de&s;ired
him to write the name of Ari&s;tides upon the &s;hell by which his vote was
given again&s;t him. 
<Q REND="inline">"Has he done you any wrong, &s;aid Ari&s;tides, that
you are for condemning him in this manner."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No, replied the pea&s;ant, but I hate to hear
him prai&s;ed for his ju&s;tice.</HI>"</Q> Ari&s;tides, without &s;ay|ing a
word more, calmly took the &s;hell, wrote down his own name upon it, and
contentedly retired into bani&s;hment. But the pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of
his country were now an object that &s;trongly &s;ollicited his return. Even
The|mi&s;tocles, his rival, was &s;o far from remem|bering his old
re&s;entments, that he now ar|dently de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
coun&s;el, and gave up all his private re&s;entments to the good of the
&s;tate. The hatred of the&s;e great men had nothing in it of that bitter and
impla|cable &s;pirit which prevailed among the Ro|mans in the latter times of
the republic, or perhaps the de&s;perate &s;ituation of their coun|try might
only occupy their thoughts at that time.</P>
<P>But the preparations by land alone were not &s;ufficient to repel
the growing danger. If the Greeks had tru&s;ted to their land armies with|out 
<PB N="136" REF="139"> further &s;uccour, they mu&s;t have been un|done.
Themi&s;tocles, who &s;aw that the vic|tory of Marathon mu&s;t be followed by
many more before &s;afety could be a&s;certained, had prudently cau&s;ed an
hundred gallies to be built, and turned all his thoughts to give Athens a
&s;uperiority at &s;ea. The oracle had declared &s;ome time before that Athens
&s;hould only de|fend her&s;elf with wooden walls, and he took the advantage of
that ambiguity to per&s;uade his countrymen, that by &s;uch walls was only
meant her &s;hipping. He had the addre&s;s to procure &s;ome money annually
coming in from &s;ilver mines, which the Athenians had in their di&s;trict, to
the purpo&s;es of equipping and manning this fleet, and now, upon the ap|proach
of Xerxes, the confederates found them&s;elves at the head of a very powerful
&s;quadron of two hundred and eighty &s;ail, the command of which was conferred
upon Eury|brades, a Lacedaemonian.</P>
<P>All mea&s;ures being taken that this brave confederacy could
devi&s;e, it next remained to &s;ettle in what place they &s;hould fir&s;t meet
the Per&s;ians in the field, in order to di&s;pute their entrance into Greece.
The people of The&s;|&s;aly repre&s;ented that as they were mo&s;t expo&s;ed
and fir&s;t liable to be attacked by the enemy, <PB N="137" REF="140"> it was
but rea&s;onable that their &s;ecurity &s;hould be the fir&s;t object of
attention. The Greeks, willing to protect all who would declare in their
quarrel, in pur&s;uance of this reque&s;t, re&s;olved to &s;end their chief
forces to guard the pa&s;&s;age which &s;eparates Macedonia from The&s;&s;aly,
near the river Peneus. But Alexander, the &s;on of Amyntas, repre&s;enting that
po&s;t as unten|able, they were obliged to change their mea|&s;ures, and at
la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;end a body of men to guard the pa&s;s at Thermopylae
where a few were capable of acting again&s;t numbers.</P>
<P>Thermopylae was a narrow pa&s;s of twenty-five feet broad, between
The&s;&s;aly and Phocis, defended by the remains of a wall, with gates to it,
formerly built by the Phocians, to &s;ecure them again&s;t the incur&s;ions of
their neighbour|ing enemy. From the&s;e gates, and &s;ome hot baths, which were
at the entrance into the pa&s;s, the &s;treight had its name. This was pitched
upon, as well for the narrowne&s;s of the way, as for its vicinity to the
&s;ea, from whence the land forces could occa&s;ionally receive
a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the fleet. The command of this important pa&s;s was
given to Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta, who led thither a body of &s;ix
thou&s;and men. Of the&s;e, three hundred <PB N="138" REF="141"> were Spartans,
the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of Baeotians, Corinthians, Phocians, and Arcadians,
all &s;uch as in the pre&s;ent exigency were prepared for the field, and were
not afraid of the numbers of the enemy. Each of the&s;e had particular
commanders of their own, but Leonidas had the conduct of the whole. But though
the determined re&s;olution of the&s;e troops was in|capable of being &s;haken,
little was expected from the nature of their de&s;tination. They were all along
taught to look upon them&s;elves as a forelorn hope, only placed there to check
the progre&s;s of the enemy, and give them a foreta&s;te of the de&s;perate
valour of Greece; nor were even oracles wanting to check their ardour. It had
been declared, that to procure the &s;afety of Greece it was nece&s;&s;ary that
a king, one of the de&s;cendants of Hercules, &s;hould die. This ta&s;k was
chearfully undertaken by Leoni|das; and, as he marched out from Lacedae|mon, he
con&s;idered him&s;elf as a willing victim offered up for the good of his
country: how|ever, he joyfully put him&s;elf at the head of his little band,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his po&s;t, and with deliberate de&s;peration waited
at Thermo|pylae for the coming up of the Per&s;ian army.</P>
<P>Xerxes, in the mean time, approaching with his numerous army,
flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, <PB N="139" REF="142"> and confident of victory.
His camp exhibit|ed all the marks of ea&s;tern magnificence and A&s;iatic
luxury. He expected to meet no ob|&s;truction on his way to Greece; he led on
his forces rather to terrify the enemy than to fight them; great, therefore,
was his &s;urprize, to find that a few de&s;perate men were determined to
di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. He had all along flat|tered him&s;elf, that on the
fir&s;t hearing of his arrival, the Grecians would betake them&s;elves to
flight, nor could he ever be per&s;uaded to be|lieve what Demaratus had
a&s;&s;ured him, that at the fir&s;t pa&s;s he came to, his whole army would be
put to a &s;tand. He him&s;elf took a view of their camp and entrenchments. The
Lacedae|monians were &s;ome of them calmly amu&s;ing them&s;elves with military
exerci&s;es, others with combing their long hair. He enquired the rea&s;on of
this conduct, and he was informed, that it was the Spartan manner of preparing
them&s;elves for battle. Still, however, enter|taining &s;ome hopes of their
flight, he wait|ed four days to give them time to reflect on the greatne&s;s of
their danger, but they &s;till continued gay and unconcerned, as men who
regarded death as the end of labour. He &s;ent to them to deliver up their
arms. Leonidas, with truly Spartan contempt, de&s;ired him to 
<PB N="140" REF="143"> <HI>come and take them.</HI> He offered, if they would
lay down their arms, to receive them as friends, and to give them a country
much larger and better than what they fought for. No coun|try, they replied,
was worth acceptance, un|le&s;s won by virtue; and that for their arms, they
&s;hould want them, whether as his friends or enemies. Upon this, the monarch
addre&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf to Demaratus, a&s;king, if the&s;e de&s;|perate men
could expect to out-run his hor&s;es? Demaratus an&s;wered, that they would
fight it out to the la&s;t, and not a man of them would &s;ur|vive his
country's freedom. Some men were heard to &s;ay, that the Per&s;ians were &s;o
numerous, that their darts would darken the &s;un. Dieneces, a Spartan,
replied, Then we &s;hall fight in the &s;hade.</P>
<P>Xerxes, thus treated with contempt, at length ordered a body of
Medes to advance, de&s;iring &s;uch as had lo&s;t any of their relations at the
battle of Marathon, to take their re|venge upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.
According|ly they began the on&s;et, but were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. The
number of the a&s;&s;ailants only &s;erved to encrea&s;e their confu&s;ion, and
it now began to appear that Xerxes had many followers, but few &s;oldiers.
The&s;e forces being routed by the Grecian troops, the Per&s;ian Immortal Band
was brought up, <PB N="141" REF="144"> con&s;i&s;ting of ten thou&s;and men, to
oppo&s;e them. But the&s;e were as un&s;ucce&s;sful as the former. The charge
was renewed the next day, Xerxes endeavouring to in&s;pire his troops with the
promi&s;es of reward, &s;ince he found they were dead to the &s;en&s;e of
&s;hame. But though their charge was violent, it was un&s;up|ported, and the
Greeks &s;tanding clo&s;ely con|nected in a body, with&s;tood the &s;hock, and
fill|ed the way with Per&s;ian carca&s;&s;es. During the&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful
a&s;&s;aults, Xerxes was a &s;pectator, &s;itting upon his throne, placed upon
an emi|nence, and directing the order of battle, im|petuous in his pride and
re&s;entment, and now and then &s;een to leap from his &s;eat when he be|held
his troops in confu&s;ion, or offering to give way.</P>
<P>Thus did the Greeks keep their ground for two days, and no power on
earth &s;eemed cap|able of removing them from their advantage|ous &s;tation.
Xerxes, out of all hopes of being able to force a pa&s;&s;age, appeared under
the greate&s;t con&s;ternation; but he was relieved from his embarra&s;&s;ment
by the appearance of Epialtes, a Trachinian, who had de&s;erted from the enemy,
and undertook to &s;hew his troops a &s;ecret path that led through the defiles
of the mountains, and through which a body <PB N="142" REF="145"> of forces
might be led to fall upon the Greci|ans in the rear. He quickly, therefore,
di&s;|patched a body of twenty thou&s;and men thither, who marching all night,
arrived at the break of day at the top of the mountain, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
them&s;elves of that advantageous po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Greeks were &s;oon appri&s;ed of this mi&s;|fortune, and
Leonidas &s;eeing that his po&s;t was no longer tenable, advi&s;ed the troops
of his allies to retire, and re&s;erve them&s;elves for bet|ter times, and the
future &s;afety of Greece. As for him&s;elf, and his fellow Spartans, they were
obliged by their laws not to fly; that he owed a life to his country, and that
it was now his duty to fall in its defence. Thus, having di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed all
but his three hundred Spartans, with &s;ome The&s;pians and Thebans, in all not
a thou|&s;and men, he exhorted his followers in the mo&s;t chearful manner to
prepare for death. 
<Q REND="inline">Come, my fellow &s;oldiers, &s;ays he, <HI>lets us
dine chear|fully here, for to-night we &s;hall &s;up with Pluto.</HI></Q> His
men upon hearing his determined pur|po&s;e, &s;et up a loud &s;hout, as if they
had been invited to a banquet, and re&s;olved every man to &s;ell his life as
dearly as he could. The night now began to advance, and this was thought the
mo&s;t glorious opportunity of meeting death in the enemy's camp, where 
<PB N="143" REF="146"> the &s;ilence would favour de&s;peration, and hide the
&s;mallne&s;s of their numbers. Thus re&s;olv|ed, they made directly to the
Per&s;ian tents, and, in the darkne&s;s of the night, had almo&s;t reached the
royal pavilion, with hopes of &s;ur|pri&s;ing the king. The ob&s;curity added
much to the horror of the &s;cene, and the Per&s;ians fall|ing upon each other
without di&s;tinction, rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Grecians than defended
them&s;elves. Thus &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to crown the ra&s;hne&s;s of their
enterprize, until the morning beginning to dawn, the light di&s;covered the
&s;mallne&s;s of their numbers. They were &s;oon, therefore, &s;urrounded by
the Per&s;ian forces, who, fear|ing to fall in upon them, flung their javelins
from every quarter, till the Greeks, not &s;o much conquered, as tired with
conquering, fell amid&s;t heaps of the &s;laughtered enemy, leaving behind them
an example of intrepidity never known before. Leonidas was one of the fir&s;t
that fell, and the endeavours of the Lace|daemonians to defend his dead body
were incre|dible. It was found after the battle, buried under a mountain of the
dead, and was nailed to a cro&s;s, by way of infamy, by the brutal victor. Of
all the train, two only e&s;caped, who&s;e names were Ari&s;todemus and
Panites. The latter, upon his return to Sparta, was <PB N="144" REF="147">
branded with infamy, and treated with &s;uch contempt, that he killed
him&s;elf. Ari&s;tode|mus re&s;erved him&s;elf for another occa&s;ion, and by
his bravery at the battle of Platea recovered that honour which he had lo&s;t.
Some time after this tran&s;action the Amphyctions ordered a magnificent
monument to be erected over the&s;e brave defenders of their country, and
Si|monides, the poet, wrote their epitaph.</P>
<P>Xerxes in this battle is &s;aid to have lo&s;t twenty thou&s;and
men, among which were two of his brothers. But to conceal the greatne&s;s of
his lo&s;s from the army, he cau&s;ed all but a thou&s;and of tho&s;e that were
&s;lain, to be buried in holes indi&s;criminately; however, this &s;trata|gem
had very bad &s;ucce&s;s, for when the &s;oldiers of his fleet were curious
&s;ome time after in tak|ing a &s;urvey of the field of battle, they
di&s;co|vered the artifice, and urged it as an act of fla|grant impiety
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Di&s;mayed at an ob&s;tinacy in the enemy that co&s;t him &s;o dear,
Xerxes was for &s;ome time more inclined to try his fortune at &s;ea, than to
proceed immediately into the country, where he had learned from Demaratus, that
eight thou&s;and Spartans, &s;uch as he had but lately fought with, were ready
to receive him. Ac|cordingly, the very day of the battle of Thermo|pylae, 
<PB N="145" REF="148"> there was an engagement at &s;ea between the two fleets.
The Grecian fleet con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred and &s;eventy-one ve&s;&s;els.
That of the enemy had lately lo&s;t four hundred ve&s;&s;els in a &s;hipwreck,
but was &s;till greatly &s;uperior to the fleet of the Grecians. To repair this
lo&s;s by a victory, two hundred Per&s;ian ve&s;&s;els had orders to take a
compa&s;s and &s;urprize the Grecians lying in the &s;treights of Eubaea, but
the Grecians being apprized of their de&s;igns, &s;et &s;ail by night, and
&s;o, by a counter-&s;urprize, fell in with them while they were thus
&s;epa|rated from their main &s;quadron, took and &s;unk thirty, forced the
re&s;t to &s;ea, and there, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, they were all &s;oon
after ei|ther &s;unk or &s;tranded. Enraged at the&s;e di&s;|appointments, the
Per&s;ians bore down the next day with their whole fleet, and drawing up in
form of an half moon, made an offer of battle, which the Greeks as readily
accepted. The Athenians, having been reinforced with three and &s;i&s;ty
&s;ail, the battle was very ob&s;ti|nate and bloody, and the &s;ucce&s;s pretty
near equal on both &s;ides, &s;o that both parties &s;eemed content to retire
in good order.</P>
<P>All the&s;e actions which pa&s;&s;ed near Arte|mi&s;a, though at
that time indeci&s;ive, yet &s;erved not a little to animate and in&s;pire the
Athe|nians, <PB N="146" REF="149"> who were now taught to think that there was
nothing either formidable in the numbers, or u&s;eful in the &s;ize of the
Per&s;ian &s;hips. Thus &s;trengthening them&s;elves with the hopes of more
&s;plendid engagements, they &s;ailed away from Artemi&s;a and &s;topped at
Salamis, where they might mo&s;t conveniently a&s;&s;i&s;t the Athe|nians.</P>
<P>In the mean time Xerxes having entered with his numerous army into
the country of Phocis, burning and plundering every town through which he
pa&s;&s;ed. The inhabitants of Peloponne&s;us, who were naturally defended by
their inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, as their country was joined to the
continent only by a neck of land, thought it the mo&s;t prudent way to de|fend
the i&s;thmus by a wall, to take &s;helter be|hind that rampart, and to leave
the re&s;t of Greece to the mercy of the conqueror. The Athenians, however,
who&s;e country lay with|out the I&s;thmus, remon&s;trated loudly again&s;t
this de&s;ertion, and endeavoured to per&s;uade the Greeks to face the enemy in
the plain. But prudence prevailed, and Themi&s;tocles gave them to under&s;tand
that though their country &s;hould be for a while over-run by the barbarous
invader, yet they had &s;till their wooden walls to rely on, for their fleet
was <PB N="147" REF="150"> ready to tran&s;port them to &s;uch of their
&s;ettle|ments as they thought proper. At fir&s;t, how|ever, this advice was
the mo&s;t hateful that could be imagined. The people thought them&s;elves
inevitably lo&s;t if they &s;hould once abandon the temples of their gods, and
the tombs of their ance&s;tors. But Themi&s;tocles u&s;ing all his eloquence
and addre&s;s to work upon their pa&s;&s;ions, repre&s;ented to them that
Athens did not con&s;i&s;t either of its walls or its hou&s;es but of its
citizens, and that the &s;aving of the&s;e was the true pre&s;ervation of the
&s;tate. A decree therefore was pa&s;&s;ed, by which it was ordained, that
Athens for a while &s;hould be given up in tru&s;t to the gods, and that all
the inhabitants, whether in freedom or &s;lavery, &s;hould embark on board the
fleet. In this ca|lamitous de&s;ertion Cimon, though very young, was &s;een
encouraging the citizens by his words and example. Bearing in his hands a part
of his hor&s;e's furniture, he went to offer it as now u&s;ele&s;s in the
temple of Minerva, and then going down to the water-&s;ide was the fir&s;t that
cheerfully went on board. When he was followed by the re&s;t of the city, &s;o
moving and melancholy a &s;ight drew tears even from the mo&s;t obdurate. A
brave, generous, po|lite, and ancient people, now forced from their 
<PB N="148" REF="151"> native &s;eats to undergo all the vici&s;&s;itudes and
dangers of the &s;ea, to implore a retreat from fo|reign &s;tates, and give up
their native lands to the &s;poiler was a mo&s;t moving &s;pectacle. Yet the
&s;tea|dine&s;s and courage of &s;ome, and the pious re&s;ig|nation of all,
demanded the utmo&s;t admiration. The young and adventurous embarked for
Sa|lamis, the old, the women, and children, took &s;helter at the city of
Trezene, the inhabitants of which generou&s;ly offered them an a&s;ylum. They
even allowed them a maintenance at the ex|pence of the public, permitted their
children to gather fruit wherever they plea&s;ed, and ap|pointed ma&s;ters for
their in&s;truction. But in this general de&s;ertion, that which extremely
rai&s;ed the compa&s;&s;ion of all, was the great number of old men they were
obliged to leave in the city on account of their age and infir|mities. Many
al&s;o voluntarily remained be|hind, believing that the citadel which they had
forti&s;ied with wooden ramparts, was what the oracle pointed out for general
&s;ecurity. To heighten this &s;cene of general di&s;tre&s;s, the matrons were
&s;een clinging with fond affection to the places in which they had &s;o long
re&s;ided, the wives filled the &s;treets with loud lamen|tations, and even the
poor dome&s;tic animals &s;eemed to take a part in the general concern. 
<PB N="149" REF="152"> It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the&s;e poor creatures
run howling and crying after their ma&s;ters, who were going on &s;hipboard,
without being &s;trongly a&s;fected. Among the&s;e, the faithful|ne&s;s of a
particular dog is recorded, who jumped into the &s;ea after his ma&s;ter, and
con|tinued &s;wimming as near as he could to the ve&s;&s;el till he landed at
Salamis, and died the moment after upon the &s;hore. Tho&s;e few in|habitants
that remained behind retired into the citadel, where, literally interpreting
the oracle, they fortified it as well as they could, and pa|tiently awaited the
invader's approach.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Xerxes was continuing his march, he was told that the
Grecians were employed in &s;eeing the games and combats then celebrating at
Olympia. It was not without indignation that he found his power &s;o little
able to ter|rify his enemies, or interrupt their amu&s;e|ments. Having &s;ent
off a con&s;iderable de|tachment of his army to plunder the temple at Delphos,
with the re&s;t he marched down into Attica, where he found Athens de&s;erted
of all but a few in the citadel. The&s;e men de&s;pairing of &s;uccour, and
unwilling to &s;ur|vive the lo&s;s of their country, would li&s;ten to no terms
of accommodation; they boldly with&s;tood the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and, warmed
by <PB N="150" REF="153"> the enthu&s;ia&s;m of religion, began to hope for
&s;ucce&s;s. But a &s;econd a&s;&s;ault carried their feeble out-works, they
were all put to the &s;word, and the citadel reduced to a&s;hes. Flu&s;hed with
this &s;ucce&s;s, Xerxes immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Su&s;a
with the news of his victories, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent him a great
number of pictures and &s;tatues, among which were tho&s;e of Harmodius and
Ari&s;togiton.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the confederate Greeks &s;ummoned a council of war
to con&s;ult upon the proper manner and place of oppo&s;ing this barbarous
inundation. With re&s;pect to the operations by land, it was univer&s;ally
deter|mined to defend the i&s;thmus by a wall, and Cleombrotus, the brother of
Leonidas, was appointed to command that &s;tation; but as to the operations at
&s;ea, the&s;e were not &s;o generally agreed on. Eurybiades the Spartan, who
was appointed to the command of the fleet, was for having it advance near the
i&s;th|mus, that it might co-operate with the army at land, but Themi&s;tocles
was entirely of an|other opinion, and a&s;&s;erted, that it would be the mo&s;t
manife&s;t error to abandon &s;o advan|tageous a po&s;t as that of Salamis,
where they were then &s;tationed. They were now, he &s;aid, in 
<PB N="151" REF="154"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the narrow &s;eas, where the
num|ber of the enemy could never avail them; that the only hope now left the
Athenians was their fleet, and that this mu&s;t not be capriciou&s;ly given up
by ignorance to the enemy. Eurybiades, who con&s;idered him&s;elf as glanced
at, could not contain his re&s;ent|ment, but offered to &s;trike Themi&s;tocles
for his in&s;olence. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Strike me,</HI> cried the Athenian, <HI>&s;trike
me, but hear me.</HI></Q> His moderation and his rea&s;oning prevailed, the
generals were re|conciled to each other, and the re&s;ult of the council was,
that they &s;hould prepare to re|ceive the Per&s;ians on the I&s;thmus by land,
and in the &s;treights of Salamis by &s;ea.</P>
<P>Mean while Xerxes, after having demoli&s;hed and burnt Athens,
marched down toward the &s;ea to act in conjunction with his fleet, which he
had determined &s;hould once more come to an engagement with that of the enemy.
This was what Themi&s;tocles mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired in his pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, but he was fearful his confederates would not have courage to
abide the encounter. Their thoughts were &s;till bent upon &s;ailing towards
the i&s;thmus, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting their army in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s.
Themi&s;tocles, therefore, in this exigence, was obliged to have recour&s;e to
one of tho&s;e &s;tratagems which <PB N="152" REF="155"> mark &s;uperiority of
genius; he contrived to let Xerxes privately under&s;tand, that the
con|federates were now a&s;&s;embled at Salamis pre|paring for flight, and that
it would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to attack and de&s;troy them. This infor|mation
was attended with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. Xerxes gave orders to his fleet to
&s;urround Salamis by night, in order to prevent an e&s;cape which he &s;o much
dreaded.</P>
<P>In this manner the Grecian fleet was blocked up, and no &s;afety
remained but in intrepidity and conque&s;t. Even Themi&s;tocles him&s;elf was
not apprized of the &s;ituation of his own forces and that of the enemy, all
the narrow &s;treights were blocked up, and the re&s;t of the Per&s;ian fleet
was &s;ent for, to make every pa&s;&s;age im|practicable. In this exigence
Ari&s;tides, in who&s;e bo&s;om the love of his country always prevailed over
every private revenge, was re|&s;olved to venture all, in order to apprize
The|mi&s;tocles of his &s;ituation and danger. He was then at Egina, where he
had &s;ome forces under his command, and with very great dan|ger ventured in a
&s;mall boat through all the fleet of the enemies by night. Upon landing he
made up to the tent of Themi&s;tocles, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the following
manner: 
<Q REND="inline">"If we are wi&s;e, Themi&s;tocles, we &s;hall
hence&s;orth <PB N="153" REF="156"> lay a&s;ide tho&s;e vain and puerile
di&s;&s;en&s;ions which have thitherto &s;eparated us. One &s;trife, and a
noble emulation it is, now re|mains for us, which of us &s;hall be mo&s;t
&s;erviceable to our country. It is yours to command as a general, it is mine
to obey as a &s;ubject, and happy &s;hall I be, if my ad|vice can any way
contribute to your and my country's glory."</Q> He then informed him of the
fleet's real &s;ituation, and warmly exhorted him to give battle without delay.
Themi&s;to|cles felt all that generous gratitude which &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a
conduct demanded, and eager to &s;hew a return of noble friend&s;hip, let him
into all his projects and aims, particularly this la&s;t, of &s;uffering
him&s;elf to be &s;urrounded. After this they u&s;ed their joint authority with
the other commanders to per&s;uade them to engage, and accordingly both fleets
prepared them&s;elves for battle.</P>
<P>The Grecian fleet con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred and eighty &s;hips,
the Per&s;ian fleet was much more numerous. But whatever advantage they had in
numbers, and the &s;ize of their &s;hipping, they fell infinitely &s;hort of
the Greeks in their naval &s;kill, and their acquain|ance with the &s;eas where
they fought; but it was particularly in their commander that the Greeks 
<PB N="154" REF="157"> had the advantage. Eurybiades had nominal|ly the conduct
of the fleet, but Themi&s;tocles in reality conducted all their operations.
No|thing e&s;caped his vigilance, and he knew how to improve every incident to
the greate&s;t ad|vantage. He, therefore, deferred the on&s;et until a wind,
which at that time of the year was periodical, and which he knew would be
fa|vourable, &s;et in. As &s;oon as this aro&s;e, the &s;ignal was given for
battle, and the Grecian fleet &s;ailed forward in exact order.</P>
<P>Xerxes imputing his former ill &s;ucce&s;s at &s;ea to his own
ab&s;ence, was re&s;olved to be a wit|ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent engagement from
the top of a promontory, where he cau&s;ed a throne to be erected for that
purpo&s;e. This &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to animate his forces, who,
con&s;cious of their king's ob&s;ervance, re&s;olved to merit his applau&s;e.
The Per&s;ians, therefore, ad|vanced with &s;uch courage and impetuo&s;ity, as
&s;truck the enemy with terror, but their ardour abated when the engagement
became clo&s;er. The numerous di&s;advantages of their circum|&s;tances and
&s;ituation then began to appear. The wind blew directly in their faces; the
height and heavine&s;s of their ve&s;&s;els rendered them unwieldy and
u&s;ele&s;s, even the number of their &s;hips in the narrow &s;ea where they 
<PB N="155" REF="158"> fought, only &s;erved to embarra&s;s and encrea&s;e
their confu&s;ion. The Ionians, whom Themi&s;|tocles had implored by characters
engraven along the rocks of their coa&s;t, to remember from whence they derived
their original, were the fir&s;t who betook them&s;elves to flight. In the
other wing the conte&s;t was for &s;ome time doubtful, until the Phoenicians
and Cyprians being driven on &s;hore, the re&s;t retired in great di&s;order,
and fell foul of each other in their retreat. In this total defection,
Artemi&s;a alone &s;eemed to &s;top the progre&s;s of victory; and, at the head
of her five &s;hips, performed incredi|ble acts of valour. Xerxes, who was a
&s;pecta|tor of her conduct, could not help crying out, that his &s;oldiers
behaved like women in the con&s;lict, and the women like &s;oldiers. As this
queen, from her &s;ignal intrepidity, was become very obnoxious to the
Athenians, a price had been &s;et upon her head; &s;en&s;ible of which, as
&s;he was upon the point of falling into their hands, by a lucky turn of
thought, &s;he pretended to de&s;ert from her own party, and to fall foul of
one of their &s;hips; the Grecks thus concluding, that &s;he either belonged to
them, or was a de&s;erter, permitted her to e&s;cape. In the mean time, the
confederates pur&s;ued the Per&s;ian fleet on every &s;ide; &s;ome 
<PB N="156" REF="159"> were intercepted at the &s;treights of Attica, many were
&s;unk, and more taken. Above two hundred were burnt, all the re&s;t were
di&s;|per&s;ed; and the allies dreading the re&s;entment of the Greeks, as well
as of the Per&s;ian king, made the be&s;t of their way to their own
country.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of the battle of Salamis, in which the
Per&s;ians had received a &s;everer blow than they had ever hitherto
experienced from Greece. Themi&s;tocles, in a &s;ecret con|ver&s;ation with
Ari&s;tides, was, or pretended to be &s;o elated, as to propo&s;e breaking down
the bridge by which Xerxes had made his way into Europe. Whether Themi&s;tocles
was really &s;incere in the propo&s;al, remains a doubt, but Ari&s;tides u&s;ed
all his powers to per&s;uade his coadjutor from &s;uch an undertaking. He
repre&s;ented to him the danger of reducing &s;o powerful an enemy to
de&s;peration, and a&s;&s;ert|ed, that it was his wi&s;h to be relieved from
&s;uch an intruder with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. Themi&s;tocles at once
acquie&s;ced in his rea&s;ons; and, in order to ha&s;ten the king's departure,
contrived to have him &s;ecretly informed that the Grecians de&s;igned to break
down the bridge.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Xerxes was &s;uch, that the &s;malle&s;t
repul&s;e was now &s;ufficient to wean him <PB N="157" REF="160"> from his
darling expedition. A&s;toni&s;hed at the late overthrow, and alarmed at this
new information, he only wanted a decent oppor|tunity to retreat, when
Mardonius came con|veniently to extricate him from his embarra&s;&s;|ments. He
began by extenuating the late lo&s;s, and the many expedients that remained to
re|lieve their &s;ituation, he laid all the blame of their defeat upon the
cowardice of the auxilia|ries, and their in&s;incere attachment to his cau&s;e.
He advi&s;ed him to return &s;peedily to his kingdom, le&s;t the fame of his
ill-&s;ucce&s;s, which always repre&s;ents things wor&s;e than they are,
&s;hould occa&s;ion any commotions in his ab&s;ence. He engaged, if he would
leave him three hundred thou&s;and of his choice troops, to &s;ubdue all Greece
with glory. On the other hand, if the event proved otherwi&s;e, he would take
all the blame of mi&s;carriage, and &s;uffer in per&s;on if it were to retrieve
the honour of his ma&s;ter. This advice was very well received by Xerxes, who,
thinking enough had been given to glory, when he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
Athens, prepared to return to Per&s;ia at the head of a part of his army,
leaving the other part of it with Mardonius, not &s;o much with the hope of
reducing Greece, as through the fear of be|ing pur&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="161"> The&s;e re&s;olutions were communicated in a
council held &s;oon after the fight, and the night following the fleet &s;et
&s;ail in great confu&s;ion to|wards the Helle&s;pont, and took up their
win|ter quarters at Cuma. The king him&s;elf, leaving his generals to take care
of the army, ha&s;tened with a &s;mall retinue to the &s;ea-&s;ide, which he
reached forty-five days after the battle of Salamis. When he arrived at the
place, he found the bridge broken down by the violence of the waves in a
tempe&s;t that had lately happened there. He was, therefore, obliged to pa&s;s
the &s;treight in a &s;mall boat, which manner of returning, being compared to
the o&s;tentatious method in which he had &s;et out, rendered his di&s;grace
&s;till more poignant and afflicting. The army which he had or|dered to follow
him, having been unprovided with provi&s;ions, &s;uffered great hard&s;hips by
the way. After having con&s;umed all the corn they could find, they were
obliged to live upon herbs, and even upon the bark and leaves of trees. Thus
harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued, a pe&s;tilence begun to complete their mi&s;ery;
and, after a fatiguing journey of forty-five days, in which they were pur&s;ued
rather by vultures and bea&s;ts of prey, than by men, they came to the
Helle&s;pont, where they cro&s;&s;ed over, and <PB N="159" REF="162" MS="y">
marched from thence to Sardis. Such was the end of Xerxes' expedition into
Greece. A mea|&s;ure begun in pride, and terminating in infamy. It is to be
ob&s;erved, however, that we have all this account from the Greek writers only,
who no doubt have been partial to their country|men. I am told, that the
Per&s;ian hi&s;torians repre&s;ent this expedition in a very different light,
and &s;ay that the king was recalled in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to
quell an in&s;urrection at home. Be this as it will, the affairs of Per&s;ia
&s;eemed after that to go backward, until the time when Alexander led a
conquering army of Greeks to invade them in turn.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. From the Retreat of XERXES to the Peace concluded
between the GREEKS and PERSIANS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3524.</NOTE> THE earlie&s;t object the
Greeks took care of after the battle of Salamis, was to &s;end the fir&s;t
fruits of the rich &s;poil they had taken from the Per&s;ians to Delphos.
Con&s;idered in a con|federated light, they were ever attentive to the duties
of religion; and though their &s;ects and opinions in philo&s;ophy, taught
mankind to <PB N="160" REF="163"> entertain but very mean ideas of the objects
of public wor&s;hip, yet it was religion that form|ed their bond of union, and
for a while held them feebly together. When that bond came to be broken, and
the council of the Amphyc|tions became rather a political than a religious
a&s;&s;embly, the general union no longer prevail|ed, and the different
&s;tates fell a &s;acrifice to their own contentions.</P>
<P>The joy of the Greeks upon this victory was general and loud; every
commander had his &s;hare of honour, but the glory of Themi&s;tocles eclip&s;ed
that of all the re&s;t. It was a cu&s;tom in Greece, that after a battle the
commanding officers &s;hould declare who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves
mo&s;t, by writing the names of &s;uch as merited the fir&s;t and &s;econd
rewards. On this occa&s;ion each officer concerned adjudged the fir&s;t rank to
him&s;elf, but all allowed the &s;econd to Themi&s;tocles, which was, in fact,
a tacit &s;uperiority. This was farther confirmed by the Lacedaemonians, who
carried him in triumph to Sparta; and having adjudged the rewards of valour to
their own countryman, Eurybiades, adjudged that of wi&s;dom to The|mi&s;tocles.
They crowned him with olive, pre&s;ented him with a rich chariot, and
con|ducted him with three hundred hor&s;e to the <PB N="161" REF="164" MS="y">
confines of their &s;tate. But &s;till there was an homage paid him that
flattered his pride yet more: when he appeared at the Olympic games, the
&s;pectators received him with un|common acclamations. As &s;oon as he appear-
the whole a&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up to do him honour: nobody regarded either the
games or the com|batants, Themi&s;tocles was the only &s;pectacle worth their
attention. Struck with &s;uch flat|tering honours, he could not help
ob&s;erving, that he that day reaped the fruits of all his labours.</P>
<P>After the Grecians were returned from pur|&s;uing the Per&s;ian
fleet, Themi&s;tocles &s;ailed to all the i&s;lands that had e&s;pou&s;ed their
intere&s;ts, in order to levy contributions. The fir&s;t he applied to was that
of Andros, from who&s;e in|habitants he required a con&s;iderable &s;um. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>I come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to you accompanied
by two very powerful divinities, Per&s;ua&s;ion and Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></Q> 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Alas!</HI> replied they, <HI>we al&s;o have

con&s;equence of this reply, he blocked them up for &s;ome time, but finding
them too well fortified, he was obliged to retire. Some other i&s;lands,
however, were neither furni&s;hed with &s;o much rea&s;on or &s;o much power.
He exacted large &s;ums from all &s;uch as were incapable of oppo&s;ition; and 
<PB N="162" REF="165"> the&s;e contributions he chiefly converted to his own
private advantage, thus &s;hewing in his own character two very oddly
a&s;&s;orted qualities, ava|rice and ambition.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mardonius, who remain|ed in Greece with a body of
three hundred thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the winter in The&s;&s;aly; and, in
the beginning of &s;pring, led them down into the province of Boeotia. From
thence he &s;ent Alexander, king of Macedonia, with a &s;plendid retinue to
Athens, to make propo&s;als for an accommodation, and to endea|vour to make
them &s;eparate their intere&s;ts from the general cau&s;e of Greece. He
offered to re|build their city, to give them a con&s;iderable &s;um of money,
to &s;uffer them to enjoy their laws and con&s;titution, and to give them the
government of all Greece. Ari&s;tides was at that time in the highe&s;t office,
being principal archon at Athens. It was in his pre&s;ence that the king of
Macedon made his propo&s;als, and that the deputies from the other &s;tates of
Greece endeavoured to avert the force of them. But Ari&s;tides wanted no
prompter but the na|tural dictates of his own heart to give them an an&s;wer. 
<Q REND="inline">"To men, &s;aid he, bred up to plea|&s;ure and
ignorance, it is natural to pro&s;&s;er great rewards, and to hope by bribes to
buy off <PB N="163" REF="166"> virtue. Barbarians who make &s;ilver and gold
the chief objects of their e&s;teem, may be ex|cu&s;ed for thinking to corrupt
the fidelity of every people, but that the Lacedaemonians, who came to
remon&s;trate again&s;t the&s;e offers, &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they could prevail
was in|deed &s;urpri&s;ing. The Athenians have the common liberty of Greece
intru&s;ted to their care, and mountains of gold are not able to &s;hake its
fidelity. No, &s;o long as that &s;un which the Per&s;ians adore continues to
&s;hine with wonted &s;plendor, &s;o long &s;hall the Athenians be mortal
enemies to the Per&s;ians, &s;o long &s;hall they continue to pur&s;ue them for
ravaging their lands, for burning their hou&s;es, and po|luting their temples:
&s;uch is the an&s;wer we return to the Per&s;ian propo&s;al; and you,"
con|tinued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Alexander, "if you are truly their
friend, refrain for the fu|ture from being the bearer of &s;uch propo&s;als,
your honour, and perhaps even your &s;afety demands it."</Q></P>
<P>All treaty being thus broke up, Mardonius prepared to act with
vigour, and invaded Atti|ca, which the Athenians were once more ob|liged to
de&s;ert and leave to his fury. He en|tered Athens ten months after it had been
taken by Xerxes, the inhabitants having again <PB N="164" REF="167"> conveyed
them&s;elves to Salamis, and other neighbouring places. In that &s;tate of
exile and want, they continued contented with all their &s;ufferings, &s;ince
repaid by freedom. Even Lycidas, a &s;enator, who attempted to propo&s;e a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was &s;toned to death, while his wife and children met with
the &s;ame fate from the women, &s;o &s;trong was the aver&s;ion which the
Athenians had conceived again&s;t all com|munications with Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, who&s;e duty it was to co-operate
with the Athenians with equal ardour, unmindful of the general cau&s;e, only
thought of making preparations for their own &s;ecurity, and re&s;olved to
fortify the i&s;thmus, in order to hinder the enemy from entering into
Peloponne&s;us. This the Atheni|ans con&s;idered as a ba&s;e and ungrateful
defec|tion, and &s;ent deputies to remon&s;trate again&s;t the Spartan conduct.
The&s;e had orders to &s;ay, that if Sparta would per&s;i&s;t in its partial
method of &s;eeking &s;ecurity, the Athenians would follow their example; and,
in&s;tead of &s;uffering all for Greece, would turn with their &s;leet to the
Per&s;ians, who being thus ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, could invade the territory
of Sparta whenever they &s;hould think proper. The&s;e menaces had &s;o good an
effect, that five thou|&s;and <PB N="165" REF="168"> men were privately
di&s;patched, each at|tended with &s;even Helotes, and were actually upon their
march before the Spartans gave the Athenian deputies any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mardonius had left Attica at this time, and was on his return to the
country of Boeotia, where he re&s;olved to await the approach of the enemy, as
he could there draw up his forces with greater ea&s;e than in the hilly parts
of Attica, where a few might be oppo&s;ed to numbers with greater &s;ucce&s;s.
He encamped by the river A&s;opus, along the banks of which his army extended,
con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred thou&s;and fighting men.</P>
<P>Great as this army was, the Greeks, with much inferior forces,
re&s;olved to meet it in the field. Their forces were by this time
a&s;|&s;embled, and amounted to &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Of the&s;e, five
thou&s;and were Spartans, attended by thirty-five thou&s;and Helotes. The
Athenians amounted to eight thou&s;and, and the troops of the allies made up
the remainder. In the right wing of this army the Spartans were placed,
commanded by Cleombrotus, in the left wing the Athenians, with Ari&s;tides at
their head. In this order they followed Mar|donius into Boeotia, determined on
trying the fate of a battle, and encamped at no great <PB N="166" REF="169">
di&s;tance from them, at the foot of Mount Cythaeron. Here they continued for
&s;ome time, awaiting in dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e a battle that was to determine
the fate of Greece. Some &s;kirmi&s;hing between the Per&s;ian cavalry and the
wing of the Grecian army, in which the latter were &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;eemed to
give a pre&s;age of future victory, which, however, for ten days neither &s;ide
&s;eemed willing to &s;trike for.</P>
<P>While the two armies were thus oppo&s;ed, waiting the mo&s;t
favourable opportunity of engaging, the Greeks, by their mutual
di&s;&s;en|&s;ions, were upon the point of lo&s;ing their free|dom in
&s;atisfying their mutual jealou&s;y. The fir&s;t di&s;pute that aro&s;e in the
army, was begun by the Tegeans, who contended with the Athe|nians upon the
point of precedence. They willingly allowed the Spartans the command of the
right wing, as they con&s;tantly had it, but they in&s;i&s;ted on having the
left, alledging, that they had earned it by former acts of va|lour and well
known &s;ucce&s;s. The di&s;pute ran high, a mutinous di&s;po&s;ition began to
prevail in all parts of the army, and the enemy were likely to become
victorious without a blow. In this general &s;pirit of di&s;&s;en&s;ion,
Ari&s;tides alone appeared unmoved. Long noted for <PB N="167" REF="170"> his
impartiality and ju&s;tice, all parties fixed their eyes upon him as the only
moderator from whom they could expect &s;atisfaction. Wherefore, turning
him&s;elf to the Spartans, and &s;ome of the re&s;t of the confederates, he
addre&s;&s;ed them in the following manner. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is not now a time, my friends, to di&s;pute of
the merit of pa&s;t &s;ervices, for all boa&s;ting is vain in the day of
danger. Let it be the brave man's pride to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that it is not
the po&s;t or &s;tation which gives courage, or which can take it away. I head
the Athenians, what|ever po&s;t you &s;hall a&s;&s;ign us we will maintain it,
and make our &s;tation, wherever we are placed, the po&s;t of true honour and
military glory. We are come hither not to contend with our friends, but to
fight with our ene|mies; not to boa&s;t of our ance&s;tors, but to imitate
them. This battle will di&s;tingui&s;h the particular merit of each city, each
commander, and even the lowe&s;t centinel will &s;hare the ho|nour of the
day."</Q> This &s;peech determined the council of war in favour of the
Athenians, who, thereupon, were allowed to maintain their for|mer
&s;tation.</P>
<P>A fatal con&s;piracy in the mid&s;t of the Athe|nians threatened
con&s;equences &s;till more danger|ous, as they were un&s;een. Some of the
be&s;t and <PB N="168" REF="171"> riche&s;t families, who had wa&s;ted their
fortunes in the war, and lo&s;t their credit in the city, en|tered into a
confederacy to deliver up Greece into the hands of the Per&s;ians Ari&s;tides,
however, &s;till watchful in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, was early informed
of their machinations, and in&s;tantly laid their &s;chemes before the ge|neral
council. Notwith&s;tanding he was con|tented with having eight of the
con&s;pirators arre&s;ted; and, of the&s;e, two only were re&s;erved for trial.
Yet his lenity, or, to call it by a truer name, his prudence, would not permit
him to act rigorou&s;ly even again&s;t the&s;e; as he knew that &s;everity in
times of general danger would but depre&s;s the ardour of the army, he
permitted them to e&s;cape, and thus &s;acrificed public ju&s;tice to public
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Both armies had now continued for ten days in &s;ight of each other,
in anxious expectation of an engagement, both willing to begin, yet afraid to
&s;trike, as the aggre&s;&s;or was to engage at a di&s;advantage. But Mardonius
being na|turally of an impatient, fiery di&s;po&s;ition, grew very unea&s;y at
&s;o long a delay. Be&s;ides, he had only few provi&s;ions left for his army,
and the Grecians grew every day &s;tronger by the addition of fre&s;h
&s;upplies. He, therefore, called a council of war to deliberate whether 
<PB N="169" REF="172"> he &s;hould give battle. Artabazus, a per&s;on of
&s;ingular merit and great experience, was of opinion that they &s;hould not
hazard a battle, but that they &s;hould retire under the walls of Thebes, while
the enemy, formed of various troops, and &s;ubject to different leaders, would
de&s;troy each other by their own di&s;&s;en&s;ions, or might be partly
corrupted to give up the common cau&s;e. This opinion was the mo&s;t
rea&s;onable, but Mardonius, &s;purred on by his natural impetuo&s;ity, and
wearied with a pro|tracted war, re&s;olved to engage, nor had the re&s;t
courage to contradict his re&s;olution. The re&s;ult, therefore, was that they
&s;hould give battle the next day.</P>
<P>This being re&s;olved on the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, the Greeks were not
le&s;s prepared for the en|gagement, for they had been &s;ecretly apprized the
night before by Alexander king of Mace|don of the re&s;ult of the Per&s;ian
councils. Pau|&s;anias, therefore, gave orders to his army to prepare
them&s;elves for battle, and draw|ing up his forces, placed the Athenians on
the right, as being better acquainted with the Per&s;ian manner of fighting,
and flu&s;hed with former &s;ucce&s;s. Whether it was fear or prudence that
&s;ugge&s;ted this change to the ge|neral, the Athenians took the po&s;t of
honour <PB N="170" REF="173"> with exultation; nothing was heard among them but
mutual exhortations to bravery, and a &s;teady re&s;olution to conquer or fall.
But Mardonius hearing of this alteration in the di&s;po&s;ition of the Grecian
army, made an alter|ation al&s;o in his own. This al&s;o once more produced a
change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the Greeks; by this changing and rechanging
the order of battle, nothing farther was done for that day.</P>
<P>At night the Greeks held a council of war, in which it was
re&s;olved, that they &s;hould de|camp from their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
march to another, more conveniently &s;ituated for wa|ter. As their removal was
performed in the night, much di&s;order en&s;ued; and in the morning, Mardonius
perceiving them &s;cattered over the plain, he &s;uppo&s;ed that they were
fly|ing, rather than retreating; he, therefore, re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue with
his whole army. The Greeks perceiving his de&s;ign, &s;oon collected their
&s;cattered forces, which the darkne&s;s had di&s;per&s;ed, but not
intimidated, and halting near the little city of Platea, there determined to
await the &s;hock of their pur&s;uers. The bar|barian forces &s;oon came up to
the engage|ment with their accu&s;tomed howling, expect|ing rather to plunder
than to fight. The La|cedaemonians, <PB N="171" REF="174"> who clo&s;ed up the
rear of the Grecian army, were the fir&s;t who &s;upported the &s;hock of the
a&s;&s;ailants. They were in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eparated from the re&s;t of
the army by the ob&s;tinacy of one of their own re|giments, who con&s;idered
their retreat as con|trary to the idea of Spartan di&s;cipline, but &s;till
con&s;i&s;ting of a formidable body of men, they were in a capacity of making
head again&s;t the invaders. Collecting them&s;elves into a phalanx, they
&s;tood impenetrable and immov|able to all the a&s;&s;aults of the enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Athenian troops who were apprized of the
attack, quickly turned back, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t their allies; but the
Greeks, who were in Per&s;ian pay, to the number of five thou&s;and intercepted
their return. Thus, the battle was divided into two, and fought with great
ardour in various parts of the field. But nothing could re&s;i&s;t the weight
of the Spartan phalanx, who, after &s;ome time, broke in upon the Per&s;ian
forces, and put them into di&s;order. In this tumult, Mardonius attempt|ing to
re&s;tore the order of battle, and ru&s;hing into the mid&s;t of the carnage,
was killed by Aimne&s;tus, a Spartan; and &s;oon after all his army betook
them&s;elves to flight. The other Greek troops &s;oon followed the brave
example <PB N="172" REF="175"> &s;et them by Sparta, and the rout became
ge|neral. Artabazus, who commanded a body of forty thou&s;and Per&s;ians, fled
with them to|wards the Helle&s;pont, while the re&s;t fortified them&s;elves in
their camp with wooden ram|parts. There they were attacked by the Spar|tans,
but being not well-&s;killed in that part of war, the Athenians &s;oon came up
to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and &s;oon effected a breach in this ha&s;ty
rampart. It was then that the &s;laughter of the enemy was indi&s;criminate and
terrible. Of all the Per&s;ian army that had taken refuge there, not four
thou&s;and men e&s;caped. Above an hundred thou&s;and men were put to the
&s;word; and the conquerors, willing to rid their coun|try at once of their
terrible invaders, refu&s;ed to give quarter. Thus ended the Per&s;ian
inva|&s;ions of Greece, nor ever after was the Per&s;ian army &s;een to cro&s;s
the Helle&s;pont.</P>
<P>The carnage being at la&s;t over, the Greeks buried their dead,
which at mo&s;t did not amount to ten thou&s;and men; and &s;oon after, as a
te&s;timony of their gratitude to Heaven, they cau&s;ed a &s;tatue of Jupiter
to made at the general expence, which they placed in his temple at Olympia. The
names of the &s;everal nations of Greece that were pre&s;ent in the
en|gagement, were engraven on the right &s;ide of <PB N="173" REF="176"> the
pede&s;tal of the &s;tatue, the Spartans fir&s;t, the Athenians next, and all
the re&s;t in order.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while &s;ucce&s;s attended the Grecian arms upon
land, they were not le&s;s fortunate at &s;ea. The greate&s;t part of the
Per|&s;ian fleet, after the defeat at Salamis, wintered at Cumae, and in the
&s;pring moved to Samos, both to guard and awe the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia. The
Grecians, in the mean while, were refitting their &s;hips at Aegina, and being
importuned by the Samians, they put to &s;ea under the con|duct of Leotichydes,
the Spartan, and Xan|thippus, the Athenian. The Per&s;ians appri&s;|ed of their
approaching, and having long ex|perienced their own inferiority, would not
venture to oppo&s;e them at &s;ea, but drew up their &s;hips upon land at
Mycale, a promon|tory of lonia, where they fortified them with a wall and a
deep trench, while they were al&s;o protected by an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and
foot, under the command of Tigranes. This, how|ever, did not deter the Greeks
from venturing to attack them. Leotichydes having endea|voured to make the
Ionians revolt, landed his forces, and the next day prepared for the
a&s;|&s;ault. He drew up his army in two bodies; the one con&s;i&s;ting chiefly
of Athenians and <PB N="174" REF="177"> Corinthians, kept the plain, whil&s;t
the other of Lacedaemonians, marched over the hills and precipices, to gain the
highe&s;t ground. The battle being joined, great courage and re&s;olu|tion was
&s;hewn on both &s;ides, and the fortune of the day continued for a long time
in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e. The defection of the Greek auxiliaries in the Per&s;ian
army, turned the fate of the battle; the Per&s;ians were &s;oon routed, and
pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter to their very tents. The Athenians had made
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the field before the Lacedaemonians could come up to
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that all the &s;hare the&s;e had in the action,
was to di&s;|per&s;e &s;ome Per&s;ian troops which were attempt|ing to make a
regular retreat, &s;oon after their ramparts were forced, and all their
ve&s;&s;els burnt, &s;o that nothing could be more com|plete than the victory
at Mycale. Tigranes, the Per&s;ian general, and forty thou&s;and men of his
army, lay dead on the field of battle; the fleet was de&s;troyed, and of the
great army brought into Europe by Xerxes, &s;carce one re|mained to bring back
the tidings.</P>
<P>The battle of Platea was fought in the morn|ing, and that of Mycale
in the evening of the &s;ame day. But what is very extraordinary, it is
univer&s;ally a&s;&s;irmed, that the victory at <PB N="175" REF="178"> Plataea
was known at Mycale before the battle begun, though it is a pa&s;&s;age of
&s;everal days from one place to the other. It is mo&s;t pro|bable, that
Leotychides made u&s;e of the report to encourage his army, and incite them to
emulate their a&s;&s;ociates in the cau&s;e of freedom.</P>
<P>During the&s;e misfortunes, Xerxes, who had been the cau&s;e of all,
lay at Sardis expect|ing the event of his expedition, but every hour coming
loaded with the news of &s;ome fatal di&s;a&s;ter, finding him&s;elf unable to
retrieve his affairs, he retired farther into the country, and endeavoured to
drown in luxury and riot the unea&s;y reflections of his &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s
ambition. To the want of &s;ucce&s;s abroad, was added the contempt of his
&s;ubjects at home; and this brought on a train of trea&s;ons, in&s;urrections,
&s;acrilege, murder, ince&s;t, and cruelty; &s;o that the latter part of his
reign was as &s;candalous as the fir&s;t part of it had been unfortunate.</P>
<P>The Grecian fleet after the battle of Mycale &s;et &s;ail towards
the Helle&s;pont, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the bridges which
Xerxes had built over that &s;treight, but finding them already de&s;troyed by
the tempe&s;tuous weather, they returned home. From this time, all the cities
of Ionia revolted from the Per&s;ians, and having entered into the general
con&s;ederacy, <PB N="176" REF="179"> mo&s;t of them pre&s;erved their liberty
during the time that empire &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ures which the Per&s;ians had brought into Greece were
very great, and the&s;e of con&s;equence, became a prey to the conquerors. From
this period, the Greeks began to lo&s;e their &s;pirit of hardy and labori|ous
virtue, and to adopt the refined indolence, the captious petulance, and the
boundle&s;s love of plea&s;ure, which extreme wealth is ever known to produce.
The former equality of the people now began to be broken, and while one part of
the inhabitants rioted in opu|lence and luxury, another was &s;een pining in
want and de&s;pair. It was in vain that philo|&s;ophy reared its head to &s;top
the&s;e calamities; its voice reaches to but a few; the great and the little
vulgar are equally deaf to its dictates. From this time we are to view a
different pic|ture; and, in&s;tead of a brave and refined peo|ple confederating
again&s;t tyranny, we are to be|hold an ennervate and factious populace, a
cor|rupt admini&s;tration among tho&s;e in power, and wealth alone making
di&s;tinction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. From the Victory at MYCALE to the Beginning of the
PELOPONNESSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3526.</NOTE> NO &s;ooner were the Greeks
freed from the apprehen&s;ions of a foreign inva&s;ion, than they began to
entertain jealou&s;ies of each other. In|deed the&s;e petty animo&s;ities had
all along &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted among them, but they were kept under by the
&s;en&s;e of general danger. As this col|lection of republics was compo&s;ed of
&s;tates entirely di&s;&s;imilar in manners, intere&s;ts and in|clinations, it
was no way &s;urpri&s;ing to find its parts ever at variance with each other.
The fir&s;t marks of jealou&s;y upon the de&s;truction of the Per&s;ian army,
exhibited them&s;elves between the Athenians and Spartans. The one a refin|ed
ambitious &s;tate, unwilling to admit a &s;upe|rior in the general confederacy,
the other an hardy unpoli&s;hed race, which could never think of admitting a
feebler &s;tate as an equal. The Athenians, with their families, being returned
to their own country, began to think of re|building their city, which had been
almo&s;t de|&s;troyed <PB N="178" REF="181"> during the Per&s;ian war. As every
new foundation aims at improving the old, they laid a plan of &s;trengthening
and extending their walls, and giving their city at once more mag|nificence and
&s;ecurity. This was but natural, however the Lacedaemonians conceived a
jea|lou&s;y at this undertaking, and began to think that Athens, from being
mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;eas, would &s;oon attempt u&s;urping all authority up|on
land. They, therefore, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the Athenians to di&s;&s;uade
them from this undertaking, giving as an o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on, the danger
&s;uch fortifications would be of to the general confederacy if they &s;hould
ever fall in|to the hands of the Per&s;ians. This me&s;&s;age at fir&s;t
appeared rea&s;onable, and the Athenians put an immediate &s;top to their
undertaking; but Themi&s;tocles, who &s;ince the battle of Sala|mis continued
to guide in the a&s;&s;emblies of Athens, ea&s;ily &s;aw through the pretext,
and advi&s;ed the council to meet their di&s;&s;imulation with &s;imilar
addre&s;s. He, therefore, an&s;wer|ed the Spartan amba&s;&s;adors, that the
Atheni|ans would &s;oon &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to Lacedaemon, in which they
would fully &s;atisfy all their &s;cruples. Having thus gained time, he
pro|cured him&s;elf to be elected for that important negociation, and took care
to draw out the <PB N="179" REF="182"> treaty by &s;tudied delays. He had
previou&s;ly de&s;ired that his colleagues &s;hould follow one after another,
and &s;till he alledged at Lacedae|mon that he only waited for their arrival to
de|termine the affair at a &s;ingle audience. Dur|ing all this time the work
was carried on at Athens with the utmo&s;t vigour and indu&s;try, the women and
children, &s;trangers and &s;laves, were all employed in it, nor was it
interrupt|ed for a &s;ingle day. It was in vain that the Spartans complained of
this procedure; it was in vain that they urged Themi&s;tocles to ha&s;ten his
bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;tedfa&s;tly denied the fact, and entreated them not to give
any credit to loo&s;e and idle reports. He de&s;ired they would &s;end again
and enquire into the truth of the matter; and, at the &s;ame time, advi&s;ed
the Athenians to detain the Spartan envoys until he and his collegues &s;hould
return. At la&s;t, finding all his pretences for delay ex|hau&s;ted, he boldly
demanded an audience, and knowing that the work was fini&s;hed, he no longer
kept on the ma&s;k. He then informed the Spartans in full council, that Athens
was now in a condition to keep out any enemy, whether foreign or dome&s;tic:
that what his countrymen had done was conformable both to the law of nations,
and the common intere&s;ts of <PB N="180" REF="183"> Greece. Every city had a
right to con&s;ult for its own &s;afety, without &s;ubmitting to the ad|vice or
controul of its neighbours; that what had been done was entirely in
con&s;equence of his advice; and, in &s;hort, that whatever injury they offered
him, they mu&s;t expect it would be returned upon their own amba&s;&s;adors,
who were &s;till detained at Athens. The&s;e declara|tions extremely
di&s;plea&s;ed the Lacedaemonians, but, either &s;en&s;ible of their truth, or
unwilling to come to an open rupture, they di&s;&s;embled their re&s;entment,
and the amba&s;&s;adors on both &s;ides having all &s;uitable honours paid
them, re|turned to their re&s;pective cities. Themi&s;tocles was received with
as much joy by his fellow ci|tizens as if he had returned from triumph, and he
was of a di&s;po&s;ition to feel tho&s;e honours with the highe&s;t
delight.</P>
<P>Having thus taken proper precautions for &s;ecuring the city, his
next care was to &s;trengthen the port, and form an harbour at once &s;pacious
and &s;ecure. He likewi&s;e obtained a decree, that every year they &s;hould
build twenty ve&s;|&s;els to continue and augment their force by &s;ea; and, in
order to engage the greater num|ber of workmen and &s;ailors to re&s;ort to
Athens, he cau&s;ed particular privileges and immunities to be granted in their
favour. His de&s;ign was <PB N="181" REF="184"> to render Athens entirely a
maritime city, in which he followed a very different &s;y&s;tem of politics
from their former governors, who bent all their efforts to alienate the minds
of the peo|ple from commerce and naval affairs.</P>
<P>But as &s;ucce&s;s in one part is apt to lead on to de&s;igns
&s;till more exten&s;ive, Themi&s;to|cles was willing to out&s;tep the bounds
of ju&s;|tice in the pro&s;ecution of his darling projects. He even formed a
plan of &s;upplanting Sparta, and making Athens the unrivalled mi&s;tre&s;s of
Greece. On a certain day, therefore, he de|clared in a full a&s;&s;embly of the
people, that he had a very important de&s;ign to propo&s;e, but which could not
be communicated to the pub|lic, as the execution required &s;ecrecy and
di&s;|patch. He, therefore, de&s;ired they would ap|point a per&s;on to whom he
might explain him&s;elf, one who&s;e judgment might direct, and who&s;e
authority might confirm him in his de&s;ign. To direct in a matter of this
importance, it was not ea&s;y to mi&s;s the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t man of
the &s;tate, and Ari&s;tides was unanimou&s;ly cho|&s;en by the whole
a&s;&s;embly, as the propere&s;t per|&s;on to weigh the ju&s;tice as well as
the utility of the propo&s;al. Themi&s;tocles, therefore, tak|ing him a&s;ide,
told him, that the de&s;ign he had conceived was to burn the fleet belonging 
<PB N="182" REF="185"> to the re&s;t of the Grecian &s;tates, which then lay in
a neighbouring port, and thus procure Athens an undi&s;puted &s;overeignty of
the &s;ea. Ari&s;tides, inwardly di&s;plea&s;ed at the propo&s;al, made no
an&s;wer, but returning to the a&s;&s;embly, informed them, that nothing could
be more advantageous to Athens than what Themi&s;to|cles propo&s;ed, but that
nothing could be more unju&s;t. The people, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
&s;hare of remaining virtue, unanimou&s;ly declined the propo&s;al without
knowing its contents, and conferred the &s;urname of <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> upon
Ari&s;tides, a title &s;till the more flattering, as he had &s;o well
de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>Thus, Athens being re&s;tored to peace and &s;ecurity, once more
began to apply to tho&s;e arts that adorn life and &s;ecure freedom. The people
began to a&s;&s;ume a greater &s;hare in the government of the &s;tate than
they had hither|to a&s;pired at, and &s;teps were every day taken to render the
con&s;titution entirely popular. Ari&s;tides perceived this, and ju&s;tly
dreaded the con&s;equences of a democratic government; he, therefore, procured
a decree, that the archons who were the chief magi&s;trates of the &s;tate,
&s;hould be cho&s;en indi&s;criminately from all ranks of Athenians without
di&s;tinction. Thus, by indulging the citizens in a part of 
<PB N="183" REF="186"> their wi&s;hes, he &s;ecured a legal &s;ubordination
among the whole.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Grecians, encourag|ed by their former
victories, re&s;olved to &s;end a fleet to deliver their confederates, who
&s;till groaned beneath the Per&s;ian yoke. Pau&s;anias commanded the Spartan
fleet, while Ari&s;tides, and Cimon, the &s;on of Miltiades, were ap|pointed to
conduct the fleets of Athens. This was the fir&s;t time the latter, who was yet
very young, was placed in a &s;phere for the exhibi|tion of his virtues. He had
formerly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be impri&s;oned towards the &s;atisfying his
father's fine, and his piety upon that occa|&s;ion gave the mo&s;t favourable
pre&s;age of his future greatne&s;s. When &s;et at liberty, his &s;er|vices in
war &s;oon became con&s;picuous, and it was &s;een that he acted with the
courage of his father, the judgment of Themi&s;tocles, and with more
&s;incerity than either. The ingenu|ous openne&s;s of his temper being ea&s;ily
&s;een, he was oppo&s;ed in the &s;tate as a counterpoi&s;e to the craft and
&s;ubtlety of Themi&s;tocles, and thus advanced to the highe&s;t employments
both at home and abroad. Under the&s;e com|manders, the allied fleet fir&s;t
directed their cour&s;e to the i&s;le of Cyprus, where they re&s;tor|ed all the
cities to their liberty; then &s;teering <PB N="184" REF="187"> towards the
Helle&s;pont, attacked the city By|zantium, of which they made them&s;elves
ma&s;|ters, and took a va&s;t number of pri&s;oners, many of whom were the
riche&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;ider|able families of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition was not more flattering to the
Greeks than in the end preju|dicial to them. A deluge of wealth pouring in,
corrupted the &s;implicity, and tainted the manners of every rank of people.
The Athe|nians already &s;killed in the arts of politene&s;s and effeminacy,
concealed their change for a time, but it &s;oon broke out among the Spar|tans,
and Pau&s;anias him&s;elf, their commander, was the fir&s;t infected with the
contagion. Be|ing naturally of an haughty and imperious temper, and &s;till
more impre&s;&s;ed with the gloomy au&s;terity of Sparta, he &s;et no bounds to
his ambition; he treated his officers, and even the confederate generals, with
&s;everity, arrogance, and di&s;dain, and &s;o much alienat|ed the minds of the
&s;oldiers, that he was for|&s;aken by all the confederates, who put
them|&s;elves under the command and protection of Ari&s;tides and Cimon.
The&s;e generals had ever pre&s;erved a contrary conduct; a&s;&s;able,
courteous, and obliging, they tempered their authority with mildne&s;s, and won
by their <PB N="185" REF="188"> manners &s;uch as they could not engage by
their benefits. An oppo&s;ition &s;o mortifying could not but be
di&s;plea&s;ing to Pau&s;anias; it was in vain that he attempted to keep up his
authori|ty by pride and o&s;tentation, his importance &s;unk with his
unpopularity, and he became contemptible even to tho&s;e that &s;till
acknow|ledged his command.</P>
<P>Perhaps it was from the&s;e motives that he re&s;olved to
&s;acrifice his country to his ambition, and give up to the Per&s;ians a
&s;tate where he could no longer expect to dictate. Be this as it will, he made
overtures for gaining the favour of Xerxes; and, in order to ingratiate
him&s;elf at the court of that monarch, he &s;uf|fered &s;ome of his more
exalted pri&s;oners to make their e&s;cape by night, commi&s;&s;ioned with
letters to Xerxes, wherein he offered to deliver up Sparta and all Greece, on
condition that he would give him his daughter in marriage. Xerxes readily
harkened to the propo&s;al, and referred him to Artabazus, his governor, to
concert mea&s;ures with him for putting it in execution. He al&s;o furni&s;hed
him with a large &s;um of money to be di&s;tributed among &s;uch of the Grecian
&s;tates as would join in the con|&s;piracy.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="189"> How long this treaty continued &s;ecret we
are not told, but it was di&s;covered at Sparta before it could be put into
execution, and Pau|&s;anias was ordered home to take his trial for the offence.
The proofs, however, again&s;t him were not &s;ufficient for conviction, as the
Ephori had made it a rule never to convict a man but upon the plaine&s;t
evidence. But his command was taken from him, and he retired, &s;till
meditating revenge and the de&s;truction of his country. It was not long,
however, before he received a &s;econd &s;ummons to appear before the Ephori
for fre&s;h crimes, and a number of his own &s;laves were found to depo&s;e
again&s;t him. Still, however, he had the fortune to come off, the mildne&s;s
of the Spartan laws, and the authority of his regal office, which he &s;till
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, con&s;piring to protect him.</P>
<P>Pau&s;anias having in this manner twice e&s;cap|ed the ju&s;tice of
his country, would not, how|ever, abandon his ba&s;e projects, or &s;acrifice
his re&s;entment to his &s;afety. Immediately upon his being acquitted, he
returned to the &s;ea|coa&s;ts, without any authority from the &s;tate, and
&s;till continued to carry on his corre&s;pondence with Artabazus. He now acted
with &s;uch little re&s;erve, that his conduct was known to the Ephori, and
they only wanted information <PB N="187" REF="190"> to convict him. While they
were thus per|plexed for want of evidence, a certain &s;lave, who was called
the Argilian, cleared their doubts, and came with proofs which could not be
re&s;i&s;ted. This man had been employed by Pau&s;anias to carry a letter to
Artabazus, and he accordingly prepared him&s;elf for the expedition, but
reflecting, that many of his fellow-&s;laves had been &s;ent on &s;imilar
me&s;&s;ages, and &s;eeing none of them return, he was in|duced to open the
pacquet of which he was the bearer, and there he di&s;covered the my&s;tery and
his own danger. It &s;eems, that Pau&s;anias and the Per&s;ian governor had
agreed to put to death all the me&s;&s;engers they mutually &s;ent to each
other as &s;oon as their letters were deliver|ed, that there might be no
po&s;&s;ibility left of tracing out, or di&s;covering the corre&s;pondence.
This letter he delivered to the Ephori, who were now convinced that Pau&s;anias
was guilty, but for a more thorough confirmation, they were willing to have it
from him&s;elf. For this purpo&s;e, they contrived that the &s;lave &s;hould
take &s;anctuary in the temple of Neptune as for &s;afety and protection, and
under a pretence of &s;upplicating the deity for the infidelity he had
committed. The in&s;tant Pau&s;anias was informed of his &s;lave's behaviour,
he ha&s;tened <PB N="188" REF="191"> to the temple to enquire the rea&s;on,
where the &s;lave informed him, that having opened his letter, he found the
contents fatal to him&s;elf, and therefore took this method of averting the
danger. Pau&s;anias in&s;tead of denying the fact, endeavoured rather to pacify
the &s;lave, and promi&s;ed him a large reward to bribe his future &s;ecrecy.
But during this interview, the Ephori had privately po&s;ted per&s;ons to
overhear the conver&s;ation, and they &s;oon divulged his guilt. The moment,
therefore, he was return|ed to the city, the Ephori re&s;olved to &s;eize him,
and from the a&s;pect of one of the&s;e magi&s;trates he plainly perceived his
danger: he, therefore, flew to take &s;anctuary in the temple of Minerva, and
got thither before his pur&s;uers could overtake him. As the religion of the
&s;tate would not permit his being taken forcibly from thence, the people
&s;topped up the entrance with great &s;tones, and tearing off the roof, left
him expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the weather. After a &s;hort &s;tay he was
&s;tarved to death; and in this mi&s;erable manner died the general who had led
on the victorious troops to the field of Plataea.</P>
<P>The fate of Pau&s;anias &s;oon after involved that of
Themi&s;tocles, who had &s;ome time be|fore been bani&s;hed, and lived in great
e&s;teem <PB N="189" REF="192"> at Argos. A pa&s;&s;ionate thir&s;t of glory,
and a &s;trong de&s;ire to command arbitrarily over the citizens, had made him
very odious at Athens. He had built near his hou&s;e a temple in ho|nour of
Diana, under this title, To Diana, the Godde&s;s of Good Coun&s;el, as hinting
his own coun&s;els upon &s;everal important occa&s;ions, and thus tacitly
reproaching his fellow-citizens of having forgot them. This, though a &s;mall
offence, was &s;ufficient to expel him from &s;o &s;luctuating and jealous a
&s;tate as that of Athens; but he was now accu&s;ed of having participat|ed in,
and having been privy to the de&s;igns of Pau&s;anias. In fact, Pau&s;anias had
communi|cated to him all his de&s;igns, but Themi&s;tocles had rejected his
propo&s;als with the utmo&s;t in|dignation. But then he concealed his
enter|prizes, either thinking it ba&s;e to betray the &s;ecrets tru&s;ted to
his confidence, or imagining it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;uch dangerous and
ill-con|certed &s;chemes to take effect. Be this as it will, upon the downfall
of Pau&s;anias, it ap|peared that a corre&s;pondence had been carried on
between them, and the Lacedaemonians declared them&s;elves his accu&s;ers
before the a&s;|&s;embly of the people of Athens. Such of the citizens as had
long either envied, or feared Themi&s;tocles, now joined in the general
accu|&s;ation, <PB N="190" REF="193"> and urged his death with great acri|mony.
Ari&s;tides alone, who had long been his open oppo&s;er, refu&s;ed to join in
this ba&s;e confe|deracy again&s;t him, and rejected &s;o mean an op|portunity
of revenge, being as little inclined to delight in the misfortunes of his
adver&s;ary, as he had before been to envy his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. It was in vain
that Themi&s;tocles an&s;wered by letters to the calumnies laid again&s;t him;
it was in vain that he alledged, that a mind like his di&s;daining &s;lavery at
home, could think of wi&s;hing for it in exile; the people too &s;trongly
wrought upon by his accu&s;ers, &s;ent per&s;ons to &s;eize and bring him
before the council of Greece. Fortunately, however, he had time|ly notice of
their de&s;ign, and went to take re|fuge in the i&s;land of Corcyra, to the
inhabi|tants of which he had formerly done &s;ignal &s;er|vices. From thence he
fled to Epirus, and finding him&s;elf &s;till pur&s;ued by the Athenians, grown
at length de&s;perate, he fled to Admetus king of the Molo&s;&s;ians for
refuge. There he fir&s;t practi&s;ed all the abject arts of a man oblig|ed to
&s;ue to a tyrant for &s;uccour. He had up|on a former occa&s;ion been
in&s;trumental in pre|venting the Athenians from granting aid to this monarch,
and this was now &s;everely re|membered again&s;t him. Admetus was from 
<PB N="191" REF="194"> home at the time Themi&s;tocles came to im|plore
protection; and, upon his return, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find his old
adver&s;ary who had come to put him&s;elf under his protection. As &s;oon as
the king appeared, Themi&s;tocles took that monarch's young &s;on in his arms,
and &s;eating him&s;elf amid&s;t the hou&s;hold gods, in|formed him of the
cau&s;e of his arrival, and im|plored his clemency and protection. Adme|tus
&s;urpri&s;ed, and moved with compa&s;&s;ion at &s;eeing the greate&s;t man of
Greece an humble &s;uppliant at his feet, rai&s;ed him immediately from the
ground, and promi&s;ed him protection. Accordingly, when the Athenians and
Lace|daemonians came to demand him, he refu&s;ed ab&s;olutely to deliver up a
per&s;on who had made his palace an a&s;ylum, in the firm per|&s;ua&s;ion that
it would afford him &s;afety and protection. Thus, continuing to &s;pend the
clo&s;e of life in indolence and retirement, hav|ing learned to pardon and
de&s;pi&s;e the ingrati|tude his country, he expected at lea&s;t their
for|givene&s;s. But the Athenians and Lacedaemo|nians would not &s;uffer him to
live in peace, and &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on having him delivered up. In this
exigence, as the king found him&s;elf unable to protect his illu&s;trious
gue&s;t, he re&s;olved to promote his e&s;cape. He was, <PB N="192" REF="195">
therefore, put on board a merchant &s;hip, which was &s;ailing to Ionia, and
his quality concealed with the utmo&s;t precaution. A &s;torm having carried
the &s;hip near the i&s;land of Naxos, then be&s;ieged by the Athenians, the
imminent danger he was in of falling into their hands, compelled him to
di&s;cover him&s;elf to the pilot, and prevailed upon him to &s;teer for
A&s;ia; where, arriving at Cumae, a city of Aeolia, in A&s;ia Minor, he was
from thence &s;ent under a &s;trong guard, and in one of tho&s;e covered
chariots in which the Per&s;ians were accu&s;tomed to convey their wives to the
court at Sardis.</P>
<P>When the unfortunate exile was arrived at the palace of the
voluptuous monarch of the country, he waited on the captain of the guard,
reque&s;ting, as a Grecian &s;tranger to have permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak with
the king. The officer informed him of a ceremony, which he knew was
in&s;upportable to &s;ome Greeks, but without which none were allowed that
honour. This was to fall pro&s;trate before the Per&s;ian monarch, and to
wor&s;hip him as the living image of the gods on earth. Themi&s;tocles, who was
never &s;crupu|lous of the means of obtaining what he &s;ought, promi&s;ed to
comply, and falling on his face before the king in the Per&s;ian manner,
declared <PB N="193" REF="196"> his name, his country, and misfortunes. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have done, cried he, my ungrateful country
&s;ervices more than once, and I am now come to offer the&s;e &s;ervices to
you. My life is in your hands: you may now exert your clemency, or di&s;play
your vengeance. By the former you will pre&s;erve a faithful &s;uppliant, by
the latter you will de&s;troy the greate&s;t enemy to Greece."</Q> The king
made him no an&s;wer at this audience, though he was &s;truck with admiration
at his eloquence and intrepidity, but he &s;oon gave a loo&s;e to his joy for
the event. He told his courtiers, that he con&s;idered the arrival of
Themi&s;tocles as a very happy accident, and wi&s;hed that his enemies would
for ever pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;tructive methods of bani&s;hing from among
them all the good and wi&s;e. Even his &s;atisfactions were continued in a
dream. At night he was &s;een to &s;tart from his &s;leep, and three times to
cry out, 
<Q REND="inline">"I have got Themi&s;|tocles the Athenian."</Q> He
even gave him three cities for his &s;upport, and had him maintained in the
utmo&s;t affluence and &s;plendor. It is &s;aid that &s;uch was his favour at
the Per&s;ian court, and &s;o great was the con&s;ideration in which he was
held by all ranks of mankind, that one day at table he was heard to cry out to
his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fe and children that were
placed there, 
<Q REND="inline">"Chil|dren, <PB N="194" REF="197"> we &s;hould have
been certainly ruined, if we had not been formerly undone."</Q></P>
<P>In this manner he lived in affluence and con|tented &s;lavery, until
the king began to think of employing his talents in &s;ending him at the head
of an army again&s;t Athens. Athough Themi&s;tocles profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an
open enemy to that &s;tate, yet he &s;till harboured a latent af|fection for
it, which no re&s;entment could re|move. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he
&s;hould be in&s;trumental in overturning a city which had been made to
flouri&s;h by his coun&s;els, gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible pain. He found
him&s;elf at la&s;t unable to &s;u&s;tain the conflict between his gratitude to
the king and his love to his coun|try; and, therefore, re&s;olved upon dying as
the only means of e&s;caping from his perplexity. He, therefore, prepared a
&s;olemn &s;acrifice, to which he invited all his friends, when, after
embracing them all, and taking a la&s;t farewell, he &s;wallowed poi&s;on,
which &s;oon put an end to his life. He died at Magne&s;ia, aged three|&s;core
and five years, the greate&s;t part of which he had &s;pent in the intrigues
and bu&s;tles of active employment. Themi&s;tocles &s;eemed to unite in
him&s;elf all the prominent features of the Greek character; &s;agacious,
eloquent, and brave, yet unprincipled, artful, and merce|nary, 
<PB N="195" REF="198"> with too many virtues ever to be men|tioned as a
de&s;picable character, and too many defects ever to be con&s;idered as a great
one.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Themi&s;tocles was thus become the &s;port
of fortune, the ju&s;t Ari&s;|tides attempted a nobler path to glory. It has
already been ob&s;erved, that the command of Greece had pa&s;&s;ed from Sparta
to the Atheni|ans; and it was agreed among the body of the &s;tates, that their
common trea&s;ure for car|rying on the expences of the war, &s;hould be lodged
in the i&s;land of Delos, under the cu&s;|tody of a man of a clear head and an
uncor|rupt heart. The great que&s;tion, therefore, was where to find a man to
be tru&s;ted with &s;o im|portant a charge, and &s;teadfa&s;tly known to
pre|fer the public intere&s;t to his own. In this ge|neral di&s;qui&s;ition all
parties at la&s;t ca&s;t their eyes on Ari&s;tides, of whom Themi&s;tocles
u&s;ed je&s;tingly to &s;ay, that he had no other merit than that of a &s;trong
box, in keeping &s;afely what was committed to his charge.</P>
<P>The conduct of Ari&s;tides in his di&s;charge of this duty, only
&s;erved to confirm the great opi|nion mankind had formed of his integrity. He
pre&s;ided over the trea&s;ury with the care of a father over his family, and
the caution of a mi&s;er over what he holds dearer than him&s;elf. 
<PB N="196" REF="199"> No man complained of his admini&s;tration, and no part
of the public money was exhau&s;ted in vain. He who thus contributed to make
go|vernment rich, was him&s;elf very poor; and &s;o far was he from being
a&s;hamed of poverty, that he con&s;idered it as glorious to him as all the
trophies and victories he had won. It hap|pened upon a certain occa&s;ion, that
Callias, an intimate friend and relation of Ari&s;tides, was &s;ummoned before
the judges for &s;ome of|fence, and one of the chief objections alledg|ed
again&s;t him, was that while he rolled in af|fluence and luxury, he &s;uffered
his friend and relation Ari&s;tides to remain in poverty and want. Upon this
occa&s;ion, Ari&s;tides was call|ed upon, when it appeared that Callias had
often offered to &s;hare his fortune with him, but that he declined the
benefit; a&s;&s;erting, that he only might be &s;aid to want who permitted his
appetites to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of his in|come, and that he who could
di&s;pen&s;e with a few things, thus rendered him&s;elf more like the gods,
that want for nothing.</P>
<P>In this manner he lived, ju&s;t in his public, and independent in
his private capacity. His hou&s;e was a public &s;chool for virtue, and was
open to all young Athenians who &s;ought wi&s;|dom, or were ambitious of power.
He gave <PB N="197" REF="200"> them the kinde&s;t reception, heard them with
patience, in&s;tructed them with familiarity, and endeavoured above all things
to give them a ju&s;t value for them&s;elves. Among the re&s;t of his
di&s;ciples Cimon, who afterwards made &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the
&s;tate, was one of the foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory does not mention the exact time or place of his death, but
it pays the mo&s;t glori|ous te&s;timony to his di&s;intere&s;ted character, in
telling us, that he who had the ab&s;olute di&s;|po&s;al of all the public
trea&s;ures died poor. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that he did not leave money
enough behind him to pay the expences of his funeral, but that the government
was obliged to bear the charge of it, and to maintain his family. His daughters
were married, and his &s;on &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the expence of the public, and
&s;ome of his grandchildren were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by a pen&s;ion equal to that
which &s;uch received as had been victorious at the Olympic games. But the
greate&s;t honour which his countrymen paid to his memory, was in giving him
the title of Ju&s;t, a character far &s;uperior to all the empty titles of
wi&s;dom or conque&s;t, &s;ince fortune or accident may confer wi&s;dom or
valour, but all the virtues of morality are &s;olely of our own making.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201"> Athens being in this manner deprived of the
coun&s;els and integrity of her two greate&s;t ma|gi&s;trates, room was now
made for younger ambition to &s;tep forward, and Cimon, the &s;on of Miltiades,
promi&s;ed to fill the &s;cene with dignity and honour Cimon had &s;pent his
youth in exce&s;&s;es, from whence it was thought no effort could extricate
him. When he fir&s;t offered to gain public favour, he was &s;o ill re|ceived
by the people, prejudiced again&s;t him by his former follies, that he
&s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel neglect. But, though he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
courage and abilities, he began to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the public,
contented with on|ly humbler &s;atisfactions. But Ari&s;tides per|ceiving that
his di&s;&s;olute turn of mind was united with many great qualifications, he
in|&s;pired him with fre&s;h hopes, and per&s;uaded him once more to renew the
on&s;et He now, there|fore, entirely changed his conduct, and laying a&s;ide
his juvenile follies, aimed at nothing but what was great and noble. Thus, he
became not inferior to Miltiades in courage, to The|mi&s;tocles in prudence,
and was not far &s;urpa&s;&s;|ed by Ari&s;tides in integrity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t expedition of any note to the com|mand of which Cimon
was appointed, was of the fleet de&s;tined to &s;cour the A&s;iatic &s;eas. 
<PB N="199" REF="202"> When he was arrived at Caria, all the Grecian cities
upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t immediately came in, and the re&s;t, which were
garri&s;oned by the Per|&s;ians, were taken by &s;torm. Thus, by his conduct as
well as by his intelligence, the whole country from Ionia to Pamphylia
declar|ed again&s;t the power of Per&s;ia, and joined in the a&s;&s;ociation
with Greece.</P>
<P>The capture of the city Eion is too remark|able to be pa&s;t over in
&s;ilence. Boges was go|vernor, who held it for his ma&s;ter, the king of
Per&s;ia, with a firm re&s;olution to &s;ave it, or peri&s;h in its fall. It
was in his power to have capitulated with the be&s;iegers, and Cimon had often
offered him very advantageous terms, but preferring his honour to his &s;afety,
he de|clined all treaty, and defended his &s;tation with incredible fury, till
he found it no longer po&s;|&s;ible to continue his defence. Being at la&s;t in
the utmo&s;t want of provi&s;ions, he threw all his trea&s;ures from the walls
into the river Strymon, after which, killing his wife and children, he laid
them upon a pile which he had erected for that purpo&s;e, and then &s;etting
fire to the whole, ru&s;hed and expired in the mid&s;t of the flames.</P>
<P>Cimon thus proceeding from one conque&s;t to another, was at la&s;t
informed that the whole Per&s;ian fleet was anchored at the mouth of the 
<PB N="200" REF="203"> river Eurymedon, where they expected a rein|forcement of
&s;hips from Phoenicia, and, there|fore, deferred an engagement till then. The
Athenian general, however, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;i|ble, to prevent this
junction, and ranged his gallies in &s;uch a po&s;ture as to prevent, it and
yet compel the enemy to an engage|ment. It was in vain that the Per&s;ian fleet
re|tired farther up the mouth of the river, the Athenians &s;till pur&s;ued
them up the &s;tream, until they were obliged to prepare for battle. The
Per&s;ians having the &s;uperiority of an hun|dred &s;ail, maintained the
conflict for &s;ome time with great intrepidity, but being at la&s;t forced on
&s;hore, they who came fir&s;t threw them&s;elves upon land, leaving their
empty ve&s;&s;els to the enemy. Thus, be&s;ides what were &s;unk, the Athenians
took above two hundred &s;hips, and following their blow upon land, the Greek
&s;oldiers jumping from their &s;hips, and &s;etting up a &s;hout, ran
furiou&s;ly upon the enemy, who &s;u&s;tained the fir&s;t &s;hock with great
re&s;olution. But, at length, the Grecian valour &s;urmounted the enemy's
de&s;|peration; a total rout of the Per&s;ians en&s;ued, numbers were made
pri&s;oners, and a great quan|tity of plunder &s;eized, which was found in
their tents. Thus, the Greeks, obtained a <PB N="201" REF="204"> double victory
by &s;ea and land upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cimon having returned &s;ucce&s;sful from this expedition,
re&s;olved to expend tho&s;e trea&s;ures which he had taken in war, in
beautifying and adorning his native city. A ta&s;te for architec|ture had for
&s;ome time been entering into Greece, and the Athenians gave the world
examples in this art, that &s;urpa&s;s all others to this very day. Victories
&s;o very humiliating to the pride of Per&s;ia, induced that empire at la&s;t
to think of peace, and after &s;ome time a treaty was concluded, in which the
terms were very honourable on the &s;ide of Greece. It was &s;tipulated, that
the Grecian cities in A&s;ia &s;hould be left in quiet enjoyment of their
liberty, and that both the land and &s;ea forces of the Per|&s;ians &s;hould be
kept at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Grecian &s;eas, as not to create the
&s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion. Thus entirely ended the Per&s;ian war, which had
kept the Grecian &s;tates united, and called all their abilities into exertion;
from that time forward tho&s;e enmities which were di&s;&s;ipated upon the
common foe, began to be turned upon each other; they lo&s;t all warlike
&s;pirit in petty jealou&s;ies, and entirely &s;oftening by the refinements and
luxuries of peace, prepared <PB N="202" REF="205" MS="y"> them&s;elves for
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the fir&s;t invader of their freedom.</P>
<P>About this time the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy was carried from Ionia
to Athens by Athena|goras the Clazomenian. Poetry was, at the &s;ame time,
cultivated by Simonides of the i&s;land of Ceos, who &s;ung the exploits of his
country in a &s;tyle becoming their valour. His writings however have not had
merit enough to pre&s;erve them from oblivion; and, it may be a&s;&s;erted,
that mankind never &s;uffer any work to be lo&s;t which tends to make them more
wi&s;e or happy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. From the Peace with PERSIA to the Peace of
NICIAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of Athens being thus in a great mea&s;ure freed from its
fears of a foreign ene|my, began to cheri&s;h inte&s;tine animo&s;ities, and
its citizens laboured with every art to &s;upplant each other in aiming at
places of tru&s;t and au|thority. Be&s;ides Cimon, who, by general con&s;ent,
had been appointed to conduct the <PB N="203" REF="206"> fleet and army, others
endeavoured to take the lead at home, and to govern with le&s;s hazard the
operations of the &s;tate. The fore|mo&s;t in this attempt was Pericles, who
was much younger than Cimon, and of a quite different character. Pericles was
de&s;cended from the greate&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious families of Athens:
his father, Xanthippus, defeated the Per&s;ians at Mycale, and his mother
Aga|ri&s;ta, was niece to Cali&s;thenes, who expelled the tyrants, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed a popular govern|ment in Athens. He had early thoughts of
ri&s;|ing in the &s;tate, and took le&s;&s;ons from Anaxa|goras, in the
philo&s;ophy of nature. He &s;tudi|ed politics with great a&s;&s;iduity, but
particular|ly devoted him&s;elf to eloquence, which, in a popular &s;late, he
con&s;idered as the fountain of all promotion. His &s;tudies were crowned with
&s;ucce&s;s; the poets, his cotemporaries, affirm, that his eloquence was &s;o
powerful, that, like thunder, he &s;hook and a&s;toni&s;hed all Greece. He had
the art of uniting force and beauty; there was no re&s;i&s;ting the &s;trength
of his argu|ments, or the &s;weetne&s;s of his delivery. Thucy|dides, his great
opponent, was often heard to &s;ay, that though he had often overthrown him,
the power of his per&s;ua&s;ion was &s;uch, that the audience could never
perceive him fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207"> To this eloquence he added al&s;o a thorough
in&s;ight into human nature, as well as a perfect acquaintance with the
di&s;po&s;ition of his audi|tors. It was a con&s;tant &s;aying with him to
him&s;elf, Remember Pericles thou art going to &s;peak to men born in the arms
of liberty, and &s;till took care to flatter them in their ruling pa&s;|&s;ion.
He re&s;embled the tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus, not only in the &s;weetne&s;s of his
voice, but the fea|tures of his face, and his whole air and man|ner. To the&s;e
natural and acquired graces, he added tho&s;e of fortune; he was very rich, and
had an exten&s;ive alliance with all the mo&s;t powerful families of the
&s;tate.</P>
<P>The death of Ari&s;tides, the bani&s;hment of Themi&s;tocles, and
the ab&s;ence of Cimon, gave opportunities to his growing ambition. Yet he at
fir&s;t concealed his de&s;igns with the mo&s;t cautious re&s;erve, till
finding the people grow|ing more and more in his intere&s;t, he &s;et
him|&s;elf at their head, and oppo&s;ed the principal men of the &s;tate with
great appearance of di&s;|interelled virtue. The chief ob&s;tacle to his ri&s;e
was Cimon, who&s;e candour and liberality had gained him a numerous party of
all ranks and denominations. In oppo&s;ition to him, Pe|ricles called in
popular a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by ex|pencing the public money in bribes,
large&s;&s;es, <PB N="205" REF="208"> and other di&s;tributions, he ea&s;ily
gained the multitude to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus, having laid a &s;ecure foundation in popularity, he next
&s;truck at the council of the Areopagus, compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t
re&s;pect|able per&s;ons of all Athens; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of one
Ephialtes, another popular cham|pion, he drew away mo&s;t cau&s;es from the
cog|nizance of that court, and brought the whole order into contempt. In this
manner, while Cimon was permitted to conduct the war abroad, he managed all the
&s;upplies at home; and, as it was his intere&s;t to keep Cimon at a
di&s;tance, he took care to provide him with a &s;ufficiency of foreign
employment.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of parties at Athens, an infur|rection of the
Helotae, or Lacedaemonian &s;laves, gave an opportunity of trying the
&s;trength of either. The&s;e men, who had for &s;everal cen|turies groaned
under the yoke of their country|men, and had been excluded from all hopes of
ri&s;ing, merely by the influence of an unju&s;t precedent to their prejudice,
at la&s;t took up arms again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and threatened no le&s;s than
the de&s;truction of the Spartan &s;tate. In this extremity the Lacedaemonians
&s;ent to Athens to implore &s;uccours; but this was op|po&s;ed by Fphialtes,
who declared, that it <PB N="206" REF="209"> would be no way advi&s;eable to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them, or to make a rival city powerful by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
On the other hand, Cimon e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Sparta, declaring, that it
was weak and in|con&s;i&s;tent to maim the Grecian confederacy, by &s;uffering
one of its members to be tamely lopped away. His opinion for this time
pre|vailed; he was permitted to march forth at the head of a numerous body to
their relief, and the in&s;urrection was quelled at their approach. But
&s;hortly after the mi&s;chief broke out afre&s;h. The Helots po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Ithome, and the Spartans again
pe|titioned for Athenian a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It was now that the party of
Pericles was found to prevail, and the Lacedaemonians were refu&s;ed a
com|pliance with their demands. Thus left to fi|ni&s;h the war with their
in&s;urgent &s;laves in the be&s;t manner they could, after be&s;ieging Ithome,
which held out for ten years, they at la&s;t be|came ma&s;ters of it, &s;paring
the lives of tho&s;e who defended it, upon condition of leaving Peloponne&s;us
ever after.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the refu&s;al on the &s;ide of Athens, and &s;ome
indignities &s;aid to be receiv|ed on the &s;ide of Lacedaemon, revived a
jeal|ou&s;y that had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e rival &s;tates, which
continued thence forward <PB N="207" REF="210"> to operate with greater or
dimini&s;hed influ|ence, until both were utterly unabled to with|&s;tand the
&s;malle&s;t efforts of foreign inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance the Athenians gave of their re&s;entment, was
to bani&s;h Cimon, who had been a favourer of the Spartan cau&s;e, for ten
years, from the city. They next di&s;&s;olved their alliance with Sparta, and
entered into a treaty with the Argives, the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the
former. The &s;laves of Ithome were al&s;o taken under Athenian protection, and
&s;ettled with their families at Naupactus. But what contributed to widen the
breach &s;till more, the city of Megara revolting from its alliance with
Sparta, was protected and garri&s;oned by the Athenians; thus was laid the
foundation of an inveterate hatred, which ended in mutual de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As, in all beginning enmities, &s;everal trea|ties were entered
into, and &s;everal leagues concluded on both &s;ides, till at la&s;t they came
to a formal rupture. Two pitched battles be|tween the Athenians and
Corinthians, in which either &s;ide was alternatively victorious, &s;ound|ed
the alarm. Another followed between the Athenians and Spartans at Tangara, in
which, Cimon forgetting the injury he had &s;u&s;tained from his country, came
in to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but <PB N="208" REF="211"> the Athenians &s;uffered
a defeat. A month or two after repaired the di&s;grace, and the Athe|nians were
in their turn victorious. The con|duct of Cimon again re&s;tored him to public
favour; he was recalled from bani&s;hment, in which he had &s;pent five years;
and it was Pericles, his rival, who fir&s;t propo&s;ed the decree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t u&s;e Cimon made of his return, was to reconcile the two
rival &s;tates to each other; and this was &s;o far affected outwardly, that a
truce for five years was concluded between them. This led the way to exerting
the power of the &s;tate upon a more di&s;tant enemy. By his advice, a fleet of
two hundred &s;ail was manned, and de&s;tined, under his command, to conquer
the i&s;land of Cyprus. He quickly &s;ailed, over-ran the i&s;land, and laid
&s;iege to Citium. Here, being either wounded by the defendants, or wa&s;ted by
&s;ickne&s;s, he began to perceive the approaches of di&s;&s;olution; but
&s;till mindful of his duty, he ordered his attendants to conceal his death
until their &s;chemes were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. They obeyed with
&s;e|crecy and &s;ucce&s;s. Thirty days after he was dead, the army, which
&s;till &s;uppo&s;ed it&s;elf un|der his command, gained a &s;ignal victory;
thus he died not only in the arms of conque&s;t, but <PB N="209" REF="212">
gained battles merely by the efficacy of his name. With Cimon, in a great
mea&s;ure, ex|pired the &s;pirit of glory in Athens. As he was the la&s;t, &s;o
he was the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful of the Grecian heroes. Such was the terror of
the Per&s;ians at his name, that they univer|&s;ally de&s;erted the
&s;ea-coa&s;ts, and would not come within four hundred furlongs of the place
where he could be po&s;&s;ibly expected.</P>
<P>Pericles being now, by the death of Cimon, freed from a potent
rival, &s;et him&s;elf to complete the work of ambition which he had begun, and
by dividing the conquered lands, amu&s;ing the people with &s;hows, and
adorning the city with public buildings, he gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over
the minds of the people, that he might be &s;aid to have attained a
mo|narchical power in Athens. He found means to maintain for eight months in
the year a great number of poor citizens, by putting them on board the fleet,
con&s;i&s;ting of three&s;core &s;hips, which he fitted out every year. He
planted &s;everal colonies in the many places which had lately &s;ubmitted to
Athens. By this he clear|ed the city of a great number of idle per&s;ons, who
were ever ready to di&s;turb government; and were, at the &s;ame time, unable
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But the public buildings which he rai&s;ed, the 
<PB N="210" REF="213"> ruins of &s;ome of which &s;ub&s;i&s;t to this day, are
&s;ufficient to endear his name to po&s;terity. It is &s;urpri&s;ing, that in a
city not noted for the number of its inhabitants, and in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace
of time as that of his admini&s;tration, &s;uch laborious, expen&s;ive, and
magnificent works could be performed. All the arts of architec|ture,
&s;culpture, and painting were exhau&s;ted in his de&s;igns; and what &s;till
remain, continue to this hour as inimitable models of perfection. To effect
the&s;e great works, he, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, had recour&s;e to inju&s;tice,
and availed him&s;elf of tho&s;e trea&s;ures which had been &s;up|plied by
Greece for carrying on the war with Per&s;ia, and which having been lodged at
De|los, he had addre&s;s enough to get tran&s;ported to Athens, where he
expended them in &s;ecuring his own power by all the arts of popularity. By
the&s;e means Athens became &s;o much ad|mired, and envied by her neighbours,
that it went by the name of the <HI>Ornament;</HI> and when it was urged, that
the common trea&s;ure was &s;quandred away in the&s;e works of &s;how,
Peri|cles an&s;wered, that the people of Athens were not accountable to any for
their conduct; for they had the be&s;t right to the trea&s;ures of the
confederated &s;tates who took the greate&s;t care to defend them. He added,
that it was fit <PB N="211" REF="214"> ingenious artizans &s;hould have their
&s;hare of the public money, &s;ince there was &s;till enough left for carrying
on the war.</P>
<P>The&s;e were rather the arguments of power than per&s;ua&s;ion, of a
man already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than willing upon ju&s;t grounds to
relinqui&s;h what he claimed. It was &s;een not only by the wi&s;er citizens,
but by all the &s;tates of Greece, that he was daily &s;triding into power, and
would, as Pi&s;i&s;tratus had done be|fore, make the people the fabricators of
their own chains. For remedying this growing evil, the heads of the city
oppo&s;ed Thucy|dides to his growing power, and attempted to re&s;train his
career by oppo&s;ing eloquence to popularity.</P>
<P>Thucydides was brother-in-law to Cimon, and had di&s;played his
wi&s;dom on numberle&s;s occa&s;ions. He was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
mili|tary talents of his rival; but his eloquence gave him a very powerful
influence over the people. As he never left the city, he &s;till com|bated
Pericles in all his mea&s;ures, and for a while brought down the ambition of
his rival to the &s;tandard of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But his efforts could not long avail again&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ive
power and corrupt influence of his opponent. Pericles every day gained new 
<PB N="212" REF="215"> ground, till he at la&s;t found him&s;elf
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole authority of the &s;tate. It was then that he
began to change his behaviour, and from acting the fawning and humble
&s;up|pliant, he a&s;&s;umed the haughty airs of royalty. He now no longer
&s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the ca|price of the people, but changed the
demo|cratic &s;tate of Athens into a kind of monarchy, without departing
however from the public good. He would &s;ometimes indeed win his
fellow-citizens over to his will, but at other times, when he found them
ob&s;tinate, he would in a manner compel them to con&s;ult their own
intere&s;ts. Thus, between power and per&s;ua|&s;ion, public profu&s;ion, and
private oeconomy, political fal&s;ehood, and private integrity, Pe|ricles
became the principal ruler at Athens, and all &s;uch as were his enemies,
became the ene|mies of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered, that this pro&s;pe|rous and magnificent
&s;tate of Athens was not a little di&s;plea&s;ing to the rival &s;tates of
Greece, e&s;pecially as its &s;tate of &s;plendor was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
formed from their contributions. The Spartans particularly &s;till continued to
re|gard this growing city with envy, and &s;oon &s;hewed their di&s;plea&s;ure,
by refu&s;ing to &s;end deputies to Athens to con&s;ult about repairing 
<PB N="213" REF="216"> the temple that had been burnt down during the wars with
Per&s;ia. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Peri|cles again&s;t the enemy in Thrace,
&s;till more encrea&s;ed their unea&s;ine&s;s; and particularly when &s;ailing
round Peloponne&s;us with an hun|dred &s;hips, he protected the allies of
Greece, and granted their cities all they thought fit to a&s;k him. The&s;e
&s;ucce&s;&s;es rai&s;ed the in|dignation of Sparta, while they intoxicated
Athens with ideas of ambition, and opened new inlets for meditating conque&s;t.
The ci|tizens now began to talk of attempts upon Egypt, of attacking the
maritime provinces of Per&s;ia, of carrying their arms into Sicily, and of
extending their conque&s;ts from Italy to Car|thage. The&s;e were views beyond
their power, and that rather marked their pride than their ability.</P>
<P>An expedition again&s;t Samos, in favour of the Miletians, who had
craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was the beginning of this rupture, which never
after was clo&s;ed up. It is pretended, that Pericles fomented this war, to
plea&s;e a famous courtezan named A&s;pa&s;ia, of whom he was particularly
enamoured. After &s;everal events and battles, not worth the regard of
hi&s;tory, Pericles be&s;ieged the capital of Samos with tortoi&s;es and
battering rams, which was the <PB N="214" REF="217"> fir&s;t time the&s;e
military engines had been em|ployed in &s;ieges. The Samians, after
&s;u&s;tain|ing a nine months &s;iege, &s;urrendered. Peri|cles ra&s;ed their
walls, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their &s;hips, and demanded immen&s;e
&s;ums to defray the expences of the war. Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, he
returned to Athens, buried all tho&s;e who had lo&s;t their lives in the
&s;iege in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner, and pronounced their funeral
oration.</P>
<P>A rupture now between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians &s;eemed
inevitable. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3572.</NOTE> Pericles, therefore, to
anticipate the de&s;igns of his rival &s;tate, advi&s;ed that aid &s;hould be
&s;ent to the people of Corcyra, whom the Corinthians, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
Lacedaemonians, had invaded.</P>
<P>As the quarrel between the Corcyreans and Corinthians gave ri&s;e to
the great Peloponne&s;i|an war, which &s;oon after involved all Greece, it will
be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;light account of its original. Epidamnus was a
colony of the Corcyreans, which growing fir&s;t rich, and &s;oon after
factious, bani&s;hed the chief of her citi|zens. The exiles joining with the
Illyrians, brought the Epidamnians &s;o low, that they were obliged to &s;end
to Corcyra, their parent city, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Corcyreans rejecting
their reque&s;t, they had recour&s;e to Corinth; <PB N="215" REF="218"> and
giving them&s;elves up to that &s;tate, were taken under its protection. This,
however, the Corcyreans began to re&s;ent, and having been remi&s;s in
affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance them&s;elves, re|&s;olved to puni&s;h &s;uch as
&s;hould offer any. A rupture en&s;ued between the Corinthians and Corcyreans,
&s;ome naval engagements en&s;ued, in which the Corcyreans being wor&s;ted, had
recour&s;e, as has been already ob&s;erved, to the Athenians for &s;upport, who
&s;ent &s;ome naval &s;uc|cours, which, however, proved of no great ef|ficacy
in their de&s;ence.</P>
<P>From this war aro&s;e another; for Potidaea, a city belonging to
Athens, declaring for Co|rinth, the&s;e two &s;tates, from being
acce&s;&s;aries, became principals, and drew their forces into the field near
Potidaea, where a battle en&s;ued, in which the Athenians had the victory. It
was in this battle that Socrates &s;aved the life of Alcibiades, his pupil; and
after the battle was over, procured him the prize of valour which he him&s;elf
had more ju&s;tly earned. The city of Potidaea was &s;oon after be&s;ieged in
con|&s;equence of this victory, and the Corinthians complained to the &s;tates
of Greece again&s;t the Athenians as having infringed the articles of peace.
The Lacedaemonians, in particular, admitted them to an audience, where the 
<PB N="216" REF="219"> deputies of Corinth endeavoured to rou&s;e them into a
&s;en&s;e of their danger from the ambitious de&s;igns of Athens; and
threatened, if left unprotected, to put them&s;elves under the command of a
power &s;trong enough to grant them protection and &s;afety. After hear|ing
what the Athenians had to reply, the Spartans came to a clo&s;e debate among
them|&s;elves, wherein it was univer&s;ally agreed, that the Athenians were the
aggre&s;&s;ors, and that they &s;hould be reduced to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of
their duty. But the di&s;pute was, whether war &s;hould be immediately declared
again&s;t them, or remon&s;trances made to bring them to rea|&s;on. Archidamus,
one of their kings, a man of prudence and temper, was of opinion, that they
were not at this time a match for Athens, and endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade them
from ru&s;h|ing into a thoughtle&s;s and improvident war. But Sthenelaides, one
of the Ephori, urged the contrary, alledging, that when once they had received
an injury, they ought not to de|liberate, but that revenge &s;hould follow
in|&s;ult. Accordingly a war was declared, and all the confederates were made
acquainted with the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>War being thus re&s;olved upon, in order to give a colour of
ju&s;tice to their de&s;igns, the <PB N="217" REF="220"> Lacedaemonians began
by &s;ending amba&s;&s;a|dors to Athens; and while they made prepara|tions for
acting with vigour, &s;till kept up a &s;hew of &s;eeking redre&s;s by treaty.
They re|quired of the Athenians the expul&s;ion of &s;ome who had prophaned the
temple of Minerva at Cylon from their city; they demanded that the &s;iege of
Potidaea &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and that the Athenians &s;hould cea&s;e to
infringe upon the liberties of Greece.</P>
<P>Pericles now &s;aw that as he had led the Athenians into a war, it
was incumbent upon him to in&s;pire them with courage to pro&s;ecute it with
&s;ucce&s;s. He &s;hewed his countrymen that even trifles extorted from them
with an air of command, were in them&s;elves a &s;ufficient ground for war:
that they might promi&s;e them|&s;elves a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s
from the divi&s;ion in the confederated councils of their opponents: that they
had &s;hipping to in|vade their enemies coa&s;ts, and their city being well
fortified, could not ea&s;ily be taken by land. He concluded with telling them
the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there was for war; and that the more chearfully
they undertook it, the ea&s;ier it would come to an happy conclu&s;ion. That
the greate&s;t honours had generally recurred to their &s;tate from the
greate&s;t extremities; <PB N="218" REF="221"> that this might &s;erve to
animate them in its de|fence, &s;o as to tran&s;mit it with undimini&s;hed
honour to po&s;terity. The people, giddy, fond of change, and unterrified by
di&s;tant dangers, readily came into his opinion; and, to give &s;ome colour to
their proceedings, &s;ent eva&s;ive an|&s;wers to the Spartan demand, and
concluded with a&s;&s;erting, that they de&s;ired to adju&s;t all differences
by treaty, as being unwilling to begin a war; but, in ca&s;e of danger, would
defend them&s;elves with de&s;perate re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Thus the people, from their love of change, entered ha&s;tily into
the war, but Pericles was per&s;onally intere&s;ted in its declaration. He was
deeply indebted to the &s;tate, and knew that a time of peace was the only
opportunity in which he could be called upon to &s;ettle his accounts. It is
&s;aid that Alcibiades, his ne|phew, &s;eeing him one day very pen&s;ive, and
demanding the rea&s;on, was an&s;wered, that he was con&s;idering how to make
up his accounts. 
<Q REND="inline">"You had better, &s;aid he, con&s;ider how to avoid
being accountable."</Q> Be&s;ides this, Pericles find|ing no happine&s;s in
dome&s;tic &s;ociety, gave him&s;elf up to the allurements of his mi&s;tre&s;s
A&s;pa&s;ia, who&s;e wit and vivacity had captivat|ed all the poets and
philo&s;ophers of the age, even Socrates him&s;elf not excepted. She was 
<PB N="219" REF="222"> inclined to oppo&s;e the Spartan &s;tate; and he, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, is thought to acquie&s;ce in her advice.</P>
<P>War being thus re&s;olved on every &s;ide, the fir&s;t dawn of
&s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to offer in favour of Athens; the city of Platea, that had
lately declared for them, was &s;urpri&s;ed by three hundred Thebans, who were
let in by a party of the town that joined in the con&s;piracy. But a part of
the citizens that had e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, falling upon
them in the night, killed a part, and took two hun|dred pri&s;oners, who a
little time after were put to death. The Athenians, as &s;oon as the news was
brought of this action, &s;ent &s;uccours and provi&s;ions thither, and cleared
the city of all per&s;ons who were incapable of bearing arms. From this time
all Greece appeared in motion, every part of it took a &s;ide in the common
quar|rel, except a few &s;tates who continued neuter till they &s;hould &s;ee
the event of the war. The majority were for the Lacedaemonians, as be|ing the
deliverers of Greece, and e&s;pou&s;ed their intere&s;ts with ardour. On their
&s;ide were rang|ed the Achaians, the inhabitants of Pellene excepted, the
people Megara, Locris, Boeotia, Phocis, Ambracia, Leucadia, and Anactorium. On
the &s;ide of Athens, were the people of <PB N="220" REF="223"> Chios,
Le&s;bos, Platea, many of the i&s;lands, and &s;everal tributary maritime
&s;tates, includ|ing tho&s;e of Thrace, Potidaea excepted.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians immediately after their attempt upon Platea
a&s;&s;embled a body of men, making up with their confederates &s;ixty
thou&s;and in number: Archidamus, who commanded the army, harrangued them in an
animated &s;peech. He told them, that the eyes of all Greece were upon them;
that they were &s;upe|rior in numbers, and were to oppo&s;e an enemy not only
inferior in number, but oppre&s;&s;ed with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own
violence and inju&s;tice. He exhorted them to march boldly into the country
they were about to enter, with that courage for which they had been long
famous, and that caution which was requi&s;ite again&s;t &s;o in&s;idious an
ad|ver&s;ary. The whole army an&s;wered with an acclamation of joy; and thus,
that war which was to be the de&s;truction of Greece, was com|menced in a
phren&s;y of tran&s;port by its &s;hort|&s;ighted inhabitants, who hurried on
to mutual ruin.</P>
<P>Pericles, on the other hand, prepared his &s;canty body of Athenians
to meet the threa|tened blow. He declared to the Athenians, that &s;hould
Archidamus, when he was laying <PB N="221" REF="224"> wa&s;te the Athenian
territories, &s;pare any part of tho&s;e lands that belonged to Pericles
him|&s;elf, he would only con&s;ider it as a trick to impo&s;e upon Athenian
credulity; he, there|fore, gave up all his property in tho&s;e lands, and
re&s;igned them back to the &s;tate, from which his ance&s;tors had originally
received them. He remon&s;trated to the people, that it was their intere&s;t to
contract the war, and to let the enemy con&s;ume them&s;elves by delay. He
advi&s;ed them to remove all their effects from their country, and to &s;hut
them&s;elves up in Athens, without ever hazarding a battle. Their troops indeed
were but very &s;canty com|pared to tho&s;e they were to oppo&s;e; they
amounted but to thirteen thou&s;and heavy arm|ed &s;oldiers, &s;ixteen
thou&s;and inhabitants, and twelve hundred hor&s;e, with a body of archers
about double that number. This was the whole army of the Athenians, but their
chief &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in a fleet of three hundred gallies, which, by
continually infe&s;ting and plundering the enemies coa&s;t, rai&s;ed
contribu|tions &s;ufficient to defray the expences of the war.</P>
<P>Impre&s;t with the exhortation of Pericles, the Athenians, with a
mixture of grief and re&s;olu|tion, for&s;ook the culture of their fields, and 
<PB N="222" REF="225"> carried all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that could be
con|veyed away with them into Athens. They had now enjoyed the &s;weets of
peace for near fifty years, and their lands wore an appearance of wealth and
indu&s;try; but from the fate of war they were once more obliged to for&s;ake
culture for encampment, the &s;weets of rural life for their &s;hocks of
battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lacedaemonians en|tered the country at Oenoe,
a frontier fortre&s;s, and leaving it behind them, marched forward to Acharne,
an unwalled town, within &s;even miles of Athens. The Athenians, terrified at
their ap|proach, now began to convert their fury again&s;t the enemy into
reproaches again&s;t their former leader. They abu&s;ed him for bringing them
into a war, in which he had not &s;trength to oppo&s;e, nor courage to protect;
they loudly de&s;ired, notwith|&s;tanding the inferiority of their number, to
be led into the field of battle. Pericles, however, cho&s;e the more moderate
part. He &s;hut up the city gates, placed &s;ufficient guards at all the
po&s;ts around, &s;ent out parties of hor&s;e to keep the enemy employed; and,
at the &s;ame time, ordered out one hundred gallies to infe&s;t the coa&s;ts of
Peloponne&s;us. The&s;e pre|cautions at la&s;t &s;ucceeded; after the
Lacedae|monians had laid wa&s;te the whole country <PB N="223" REF="226"> round
Athens, and in&s;ulted the defenders of the city by their numbers and their
reproaches, finding the place impregnable, they abandon|ed the &s;iege, and the
inhabitants once more i&s;&s;ued from their walls in joy and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The Athenians after this &s;evere mortifica|tion, re&s;olved to
retaliate: being left at liberty to act o&s;&s;en&s;ively, as well by land as
&s;ea, they invaded the enemies territory with their whole force in turn, and
took Ni&s;ae, a &s;trong haven, with walls reaching unto the city of
Nigara.</P>
<P>Proud of the fir&s;t dawn of &s;ucce&s;s, the fir&s;t campaign being
elap&s;ed, during the winter they expre&s;&s;ed their triumph by public games
at the funerals of tho&s;e that were &s;lain in battle. They placed their
bodies in tents three days before the funeral; upon the fourth day cof|fins of
cyprus was &s;ent from the tribes to con|vey the bones of their relations; the
proce&s;|&s;ion marched with &s;olemn pomp, attended by the inhabitants and
&s;trangers who vi&s;ited the city; their relations and children of the
&s;oldiers who were killed, &s;tood weeping at the &s;epul|chre; tho&s;e who
fell at the battle of Mara|thon indeed were buried on the field, but the re&s;t
received one common interment in a place called Cerannicus. Pericles, who had
contri|buted <PB N="224" REF="227"> to the &s;aving of his country,
contribut|ed al&s;o to its honour, and pronounced a fune|ral oration over them,
which remains to this day, at once a mark of his eloquence and his gratitude.
But the joy of the public was not confined to empty prai&s;es, ceremonies, and
tears; a &s;tipend was &s;et apart for maintaining the widows and the orphans
of tho&s;e who fell in the &s;ervice of their country. And thus end|ed the
fir&s;t year of the Peloponne&s;ian war.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the en&s;uing &s;ummer, the Lacedaemonians
renewed their ho&s;tilities, and invaded the territories of Athens with the
&s;ame number of men as before. In this man|ner the&s;e capricious &s;tates
went on to harra&s;s and depopulate each other: but a more terri|ble
puni&s;hment now began to threaten them from nature. A plague broke out in the
city of Athens, a more terrible than which is &s;carcely recorded in the annals
of hi&s;tory. It is related, that it began in Ethiopia, whence it de&s;cended
into Egypt, from thence travelled into Libya and Per&s;ia, and at la&s;t broke
like a flood upon Athens. This pe&s;tilence baffled the utmo&s;t efforts of
art, the mo&s;t robu&s;t con|&s;titutions were unable to with&s;tand its
attacks, no &s;kill could obviate, nor no remedy di&s;pel the terrible
infection. The in&s;tant a per&s;on was <PB N="225" REF="228"> &s;eized, he was
&s;truck with de&s;pair, which quite di&s;abled him from attempting a cure. The
humanity of friends was fatal to them&s;elves, as it was ineffectual to the
unhappy &s;ufferers. The prodigious quantity of baggage which had been removed
out of their country into their city increa&s;ed the calamity. Mo&s;t of the
inhabitants, for want of lodging, lived in little cottages, in which they could
&s;carce breathe, while the burning heat of the &s;ummer increa&s;ed the
pe&s;tilential malignity. They were &s;een confu&s;edly huddled together, the
dead as well as the dying, &s;ome crawling through the &s;treets, &s;ome lying
along by the &s;ides of fountains, whither they had endeavour|ed to repair to
quench the raging thir&s;t which con&s;umed them. Their very temples were
filled with dead bodies, and every part of the city exhibited a dreadful image
of death, without the lea&s;t remedy for the pre&s;ent, or the lea&s;t hopes
with regard to futurity. It &s;eized all with &s;uch violence, that they fell
one upon another as they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets. It was al&s;o attended
with &s;uch uncommon pe&s;ti|lential vapours, that the very bea&s;ts and birds
of prey, though fami&s;hing round the walls of the city, would not touch the
bodies of tho&s;e <PB N="226" REF="229"> who died of it. Even in tho&s;e who
recovered, it left &s;uch a tincture of its malignity, that it &s;truck upon
their &s;en&s;es. It effected the no|tices and memory of all the pa&s;&s;ages
of their lives, and they knew neither them&s;elves nor their neare&s;t
relations. The circum&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e are de&s;cribed at large by
Thucy|dides, who was &s;ick of it him&s;elf; and he ob|&s;erves, among other
effects of it, that it intro|duced into the city a more licentious way of
living. For the people at fir&s;t had recour&s;e to their gods to avert that
judgment; but find|ing they were all alike infected, whether they wor&s;hipped
them or not, and that it was ge|nerally mortal, they abandoned them&s;elves at
once to de&s;pair and riot: for &s;ince they held their lives but as it were by
the day, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were re&s;olved to
make the mo&s;t of their tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and
money. The cau&s;e of it was generall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> imputed to Pericles, who, by drawing &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> numbers into the city, was thought to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> corrupted the very air. Yet, though
this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> raging within, and the
enemy wa&s;ting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> country without,
he was &s;till in the &s;ame mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> as
before, that they ought not to put all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hopes upon the i&s;&s;ue of a battle. In the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> time, the enemy advancing towards the
co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <PB N="227" REF="230"> laid
wa&s;te the whole country, and returned, af|ter having in&s;ulted the wretched
Athenians, al|ready thinned by pe&s;tilence and famine.</P>
<P>Ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy were the pre|vailing characters of
the Athenians, and as the&s;e carried them on a &s;udden to their greate&s;t
exce&s;&s;es, they &s;oon brought them back within the bounds of moderation and
re&s;pect. Peri|cles had been long a favourite; the calamities of the &s;tate
at la&s;t began to render him obnoxi|ous; they had depo&s;ed him from the
command of his army, but now repented their ra&s;hne&s;s; and rein&s;tated him
a &s;hort time after, with more than former authority. By dint of &s;uf|fering,
they began to bear patiently their do|me&s;tic misfortunes, and, impre&s;t with
a love for their country, a&s;ked pardon for their for|mer ingratitude. But he
did not live long to enjoy his honours. He was &s;eized with the plague, which,
like a malignant enemy, &s;truck its &s;evere&s;t blow at parting. Being
extremely ill and ready to breathe his la&s;t, the principal citizens, and
&s;uch of his friends that had not for&s;aken him, di&s;cour&s;ing in his
bed-chamber concerning the lo&s;s they were about to &s;u&s;tain, ran over his
exploits, and computed the num|ber of his victories. They did not imagine that
Pericles attended to what they &s;aid, as he <PB N="228" REF="231"> &s;eemed
in&s;en&s;ible; but it was far otherwi&s;e, for not a &s;ingle word of their
di&s;cour&s;e had e&s;cap|ed him. At la&s;t, cried he, why will you extol a
&s;eries of actions, in which fortune had the greate&s;t part; there is one
circum&s;tance which I would not have forgotten, yet which you have pa&s;&s;ed
over; I could wi&s;h to have it re|membered, as the mo&s;t glorious
circum&s;tance of my life,&mdash;that I never yet cau&s;ed a &s;ingle citizen
to put on mourning.</P>
<P>Thus died Pericles, in whom were united a number of excellent
qualities without imparing each other. As well &s;killed in naval affairs as in
the conduct of armies; as well &s;killed in the arts of rai&s;ing money as of
employing it; eloquent in public, and plea&s;ing in private; he was a patron of
arti&s;ts, at once informing them by his ta&s;te and example.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t memorable tran&s;action of the fol|lowing years, was the
&s;iege of Platea by the Lacedaemonians. This was one of the mo&s;t famous
&s;ieges in antiquity, on account of the vigorous efforts of both parties, but
e&s;pecially for the glorious re&s;i&s;tance made by the be&s;ieged, and the
&s;tratagems to e&s;cape the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians be&s;ieged this place in the beginning of the
third campaign. As &s;oon as <PB N="229" REF="232"> they had fixed their camp
round the city, in order to lay wa&s;te the places adjacent, the Plataeans
&s;ent deputies to the Lacedaemonian general, declaring the inju&s;tice of
injuring them, who had received their liberties on a former occa&s;ion from the
Lacedaemonians them&s;elves. The Lacedaemonians replied, that there was but one
method to in&s;ure their &s;afety, which was to renew that alliance by which
they had originally procured their freedom; to di&s;claim their Athenian
&s;upporters, and to unite with the Lacedaemonians, who had power and will to
protect them. The deputies replied, they could not po&s;&s;ibly come to any
agreement without fir&s;t &s;ending to Athens, whither their wives and children
were retired. The Lacedaemonians permitted them to &s;end thither, and the
Athenians &s;olemnly promi&s;ing to &s;uccour them to the utmo&s;t of their
power, the Plataeans re&s;olved to &s;uffer the la&s;t extremi|ties rather than
&s;urrender, and prepared for a vigorous defence, with a &s;teady re&s;olution
to &s;ucceed or fall.</P>
<P>Archidamus, the Lacedaemonian general, after calling upon the gods
to witne&s;s that he did not fir&s;t infringe the alliance, prepared for the
&s;iege with equal per&s;everance. He &s;ur|rounded the city with a
circumvallation of trees, <PB N="230" REF="233"> which were laid very clo&s;e
together, their branches turned towards the city. He then rai&s;ed batteries
upon them, and formed a terrace &s;ufficient to &s;upport his warlike
ma|chines. His army worked night and day without intermi&s;&s;ion &s;or
&s;eventy days, one half of the &s;oldiers repo&s;ing them&s;elves while the
others were at work.</P>
<P>The be&s;ieged ob&s;erving the works begin to ri&s;e round them,
threw up a wooden wall up|on the walls of the city, oppo&s;ite the platform, in
order that they might always out-top the be|&s;iegers. This wall was covered on
the out&s;ide with hydes both raw and dry, in order to &s;hel|ter it from the
be&s;iegers fires. Thus both walls &s;eemed to vie with each other for
&s;upe|riority, till at la&s;t the be&s;ieged, without amu&s;|ing them&s;elves
at this work any longer, built another within in the form of a half moon,
be|hind which they might retire in ca&s;e their outer works were forced.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the be&s;iegers having mounted their engines of
war, &s;hook the city wall in a very terrible manner; which, though it alarmed
the citizens, did not however di&s;|courage them: they employed every art that
fortification could &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t the enemy's batteries. They catched
with ropes the heads <PB N="231" REF="234"> of the battering rams that were
urged again&s;t them, and deadened their force with levers. The be&s;iegers
finding their attack did not go on &s;ucce&s;sfully, and that a new wall was
rai&s;ed again&s;t their platform, de&s;paired of being able to &s;torm the
place; and, therefore, changed the &s;iege into a blockade, after having vainly
attempted to &s;et fire to the city, which was &s;uddenly quenched by a
&s;hower. The city was now &s;urrounded by a brick wall, &s;uddenly erected,
&s;trengthened on each &s;ide by a deep ditch. The whole army was engaged
&s;ucce&s;|&s;ively upon this wall, and when it was fini&s;hed they left a
guard over half of it; the Boeoti|ans offering to guard the other half, while
the re&s;t of the army returned to Sparta.</P>
<P>In this manner the wretched Plataeans were cooped up by a &s;trong
wall without any hopes of redre&s;s, and only awaited the mercy of the
conqueror. There were now in Plataea but four hundred inhabitants, and
four&s;core Athenians, with an hundred and ten women to dre&s;s their victuals,
and no other per&s;on, whether freeman or &s;lave, all the re&s;t having having
been &s;ent to Athens before the &s;iege. At la&s;t the inhabitants of Plataea
having lo&s;t all hopes of &s;uccour, and being in the utmo&s;t want of
provi&s;ions, formed a re&s;olution to cut <PB N="232" REF="235"> their way
through the enemy. But half of them &s;truck with the greatne&s;s of the
danger, and the boldne&s;s of the enterprize, entirely lo&s;t courage when they
came to the execution, but the re&s;t (who were about two hundred and twenty
&s;oldiers) per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution, and e&s;caped in the following
manner. The be&s;ieged fir&s;t took the height of the wall, by counting the
rows of bricks which compo&s;ed it, and this they did at different times, and
employed &s;everal men for that purpo&s;e, in or|der that they might not
mi&s;take in the calcula|tion. This was the ea&s;ier, becau&s;e as the wall
&s;tood but at a &s;mall di&s;tance, every part of it was very vi&s;ible. They
then made ladders of a proper length. All things being now ready for executing
the de&s;ign, the be&s;ieged left the city one night when there was no moon, in
the mid&s;t of a &s;torm of wind and rain. After cro&s;&s;|ing the fir&s;t
ditch they drew near the wall un|di&s;covered through the darkne&s;s of the
night, not to mention that the noi&s;e made by the rain and wind prevented
their being heard. They marched at &s;ome di&s;tance from one another, to
prevent the cla&s;hing of their arms, which were light, in order that tho&s;e
who carried them might be the more active; and one of their legs was naked, to
keep them from &s;lid|ing <PB N="233" REF="236"> &s;o ea&s;ily in the mire.
Tho&s;e who carried the ladders laid them in the &s;pace between the towers,
where they knew no guard was po&s;ted, becau&s;e it rained. That in&s;tant
twelve men mounted the ladders, armed with only a coat of mail and a dagger,
and marched directly to the towers, &s;ix on each &s;ide. They were fol|lowed
by &s;oldiers armed only with javelins, that they might mount the ea&s;ier, and
their &s;hields were carried after them to be u&s;ed in the charge. When mo&s;t
of the&s;e were got to the top of the wall, they were di&s;covered by the
falling of a tile, which one of their com|rades in taking hold of the parapet
had thrown down. The alarm was immediately given from the towers, and the whole
army ap|proached the wall, without di&s;covering the oc|ca&s;ion of the outcry
from the gloom of the night and the violence of the &s;torm. Be&s;ides which,
tho&s;e who had &s;taid behind in the city, beat an alarm at the &s;ame time in
another quarter, to make a diver&s;ion, &s;o that the ene|my did not know which
way to turn them&s;elves, and were afraid to quit their po&s;ts. But a corps de
re&s;erve of three hundred men, who were kept for any unfore&s;een accident
that might happen, quitted the contravallation, and ran to that part where they
heard the noi&s;e, <PB N="234" REF="237"> and torches were held up towards
Thebes, to &s;hew that they mu&s;t run that way. But tho&s;e in the city, to
render the &s;ignal of no u&s;e, made others at the &s;ame time in different
quar|ters, having prepared them on the walls for that purpo&s;e. In the mean
time, tho&s;e who had mounted fir&s;t having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of
the two towers which flanked the interval where the ladders were &s;et, and
having killed tho&s;e who guarded them, po&s;ted them&s;elves there to defend
the pa&s;&s;age, and keep off the be&s;iegers. Then &s;etting ladders on the
top of the wall betwixt the two towers, they cau&s;ed a good number of their
comrades to mount, in order to keep off, by the di&s;charge of their arrows, as
well tho&s;e who were advancing to the foot of the wall, as the others who were
ha&s;tening to the neighbouring towers. Whil&s;t this was doing they had time
to &s;et up &s;everal ladders, and to throw down the parapet, that the re&s;t
might come up with greater ea&s;e. As fa&s;t as they came up, they went down on
the other &s;ide, and drew up near the fo&s;&s;e, on the out&s;ide, to &s;hoot
at tho&s;e who appeared. Af|ter they were pa&s;&s;ed over, the men who were in
the towers came down la&s;t, and made to the fo&s;&s;e to follow after the
re&s;t. That in&s;tant the guard, with three hundred torches came 
<PB N="235" REF="238"> up. However, as the Plataeans &s;aw their ene|mies by
this light better than they were &s;een by them, they therefore took a &s;urer
aim, by which means the la&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the ditch without being attacked in
their pa&s;&s;age. However, this was not done without much difficulty,
becau&s;e the ditch was frozen over, and the ice would not bear on account of
thaw and heavy rains. The violence of the &s;torm was of great advantage to
them. After all were pa&s;&s;ed they took the road towards Thebes, the better
to conceal their retreat, becau&s;e it was not likely they had fled towards a
city of the enemy's. Imme|diately they perceived the be&s;iegers with torches
in their hands pur&s;uing them in the road that led to Athens. After keeping
that of Thebes about &s;ix or &s;even &s;tadia, they turn|ed &s;hort towards
the mountain, and re&s;umed the route of Athens, whither two hundred and twelve
arrived out of two hundred and twenty, who had quitted the place, the re&s;t
having re|turned back to it through fear, one archer ex|cepted, who was taken
on the &s;ide of the fo&s;&s;e of contravallation. The be&s;iegers, after
hav|ing pur&s;ued them to no purpo&s;e, returned to their camp. In the mean
time, the Plataeans, who remained in the city, &s;uppo&s;ing that all their
companions had been killed, (becau&s;e tho&s;e <PB N="236" REF="239"> who were
returned, to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, af|firmed they were) &s;ent a herald to
demand their dead bodies, but being told the true &s;tate of the affair, he
withdrew. At the end of the following campaign, the Plataeans being in
ab&s;olute want of provi&s;ions, and unable to make the lea&s;t defence,
&s;urrendered upon con|dition that they &s;hould not be puni&s;hed till they
had been tried and adjudged in form of ju&s;tice. Five commi&s;&s;ioners came
for this purpo&s;e from Lacedaemon, and the&s;e without charging them with any
crime, barely a&s;ked them whether they had done any &s;ervice to the
Lacedaemonians and the allies in this war? The Plataeans were much
&s;urpri&s;ed, as well as puzzled at this que&s;tion, and were &s;en&s;ible,
that it had been &s;ugge&s;ted by the Thebans, their profe&s;&s;ed enemies, who
had vowed their de&s;truction. They, therefore, put the Lace|daemonians in mind
of the &s;ervices they had done to Greece in general, both at the battle of
Artemi&s;ium and that of Plataea, and particular|ly in Lacedaemonia at the time
of the earth|quake, which was followed by the revolt of their &s;laves. The
only rea&s;on they declared their having joined the Athenians afterwards, was
to defend them&s;elves from the ho&s;tilities of the Thebans, again&s;t whom
they had im|plored <PB N="237" REF="240"> the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Lacedaemonians to no purpo&s;e. That if that was imputed to them as a crime,
which was only their misfortune, it ought not, however, entirely to obliterate
the remembrance of their former &s;ervices. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ca&s;t your eyes, &s;aid they, on the monuments of
your ance&s;tors which you &s;ee here, to whom we annually pay all the honours
which can be rendered to the names of the dead. You thought fit to intru&s;t
their bodies with us, as we were eye-witne&s;&s;es of their bravery. And yet
you will now give up their a&s;hes to their murtherers, in abandoning us to the
Thebans who fought again&s;t them at the battle of Pla|taea? Will you en&s;lave
a province where Greece recovered its liberty? Will you de&s;troy the temples
of tho&s;e gods to whom you owed the victory? Will you aboli&s;h the memory of
their founders who contributed &s;o greatly to your &s;afety? On this
occa&s;ion, we may ven|ture to &s;ay, our intere&s;t is in&s;eparable from your
glory, and you cannot deliver up your ancient friends and benefactors to the
unju&s;t hatred of the Thebans, without eternal infamy to your&s;elves."</Q>
One would conclude, that the&s;e ju&s;t remon&s;trances &s;hould have made
&s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the Lacedaemonians, but they were bia&s;&s;ed more by
the an&s;wer the <PB N="238" REF="241"> Thebans made, and which was
expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t haughty and bitter terms again&s;t the Plataeans;
and be&s;ides, they had brought their in&s;tructions from Lacedaemon. They
&s;tood, therefore, to their fir&s;t que&s;tion, Whether the Plataeans had done
them any &s;ervice &s;ince the war? and making them pa&s;s one after another,
as they &s;everally an&s;wered No, each was imme|diately butchered, and not one
e&s;caped. About two hundred were killed in this man|ner, and twenty-five
Athenians, who were among them, met with the &s;ame unhappy fate. Their wives,
who had been taken pri|&s;oners, were made &s;laves. The Thebans af|terwards
peopled their city with exiles from Megara and Plataea, but the year after they
demoli&s;hed it entirely. It was in this manner the Lacedaemonians, in the
hopes of reaping great advantages from the Thebans, &s;acrificed the Plataeans
to their animo&s;ity, ninety-three years after their fir&s;t alliance with the
Athenians.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over &s;everal particular incidents of the &s;ucceeding
campaign, in which the Gre|cian &s;tates mutually de&s;troyed each other,
without promoting general happine&s;s, or e&s;ta|bli&s;hing any common form of
government. The fluctuations of &s;ucce&s;s were various. The Athenians took
the city of Pylus from the La|cedaemonians; <PB N="239" REF="242"> and they, on
the other hand, made annual incur&s;ions into Attica. More than one overture
for a peace was made by Cleon, who had a great a&s;cendant among the Athenians,
and prevented their taking effect. The war was, therefore, renewed with all its
former animo&s;ities. The i&s;land of Pylus be|came the &s;cene of mutual
contention. De|mo&s;thenes, who afterwards became the cele|brated orator, being
joined in commi&s;&s;ion with Cleon, landed on the i&s;land, in order to
di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s the Lacedaemonians, who &s;till remain|ed there. They
attacked the enemy with great vigour, drove them from po&s;t to po&s;t, and
gaining ground perpetually, at la&s;t forced them to the extremity of the
i&s;land. The La|cedaemonians had &s;tormed a fort that was thought
inacce&s;&s;ible. There they drew up in battle array, faced about to that
&s;ide only where they could be attacked, and defended them&s;elves like &s;o
many lions. As the engage|ment had held the greate&s;t part of the day, and the
&s;oldiers were oppre&s;&s;ed with heat and wearine&s;s, and parched with
thir&s;t, the gene|ral of the Me&s;&s;enians directed him&s;elf to Cleon and
Demo&s;thenes, &s;aid, that all their efforts would be to no purpo&s;e,
unle&s;s they charged their enemy's rear, and promi&s;ed, if they 
<PB N="240" REF="243"> would give him but &s;ome troops, armed with mi&s;&s;ive
weapons, that he would endeavour to find a pa&s;&s;age. Accordingly, he and his
fol|lowers climbed up certain &s;teep and craggy places, which were not
guarded, when, com|ing down unperceived into the fort, he ap|peared on a
&s;udden at the backs of the Lace|daemonians, which entirely damped their
cou|rage, and afterwards completed their over|throw. They now made but a very
feeble re|&s;i&s;tance, and being oppre&s;&s;ed with numbers, attacked on all
&s;ides, and dejected through fatigue and de&s;pair, they began to give way:
but the Athenians &s;eized on all the pa&s;&s;es to cut off their retreat.
Cleon and Demo&s;thenes finding, that &s;hould the battle continue, not a man
of them would e&s;cape, and being de&s;irous of carrying them alive to Athens,
they commanded their &s;oldiers to de&s;i&s;t, and cau&s;ed proclama|tion to be
made by a herald for them to lay down their arms, and &s;urrender at
di&s;cretion. At the&s;e words the greate&s;t part lowered their &s;hields, and
clapped their hands in token of approbation. A kind of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms
was agreed upon, and their commander de&s;ir|ed leave might be granted him to
di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to the camp to know the re&s;olution of the
generals. This was not allowed, but <PB N="241" REF="244"> they called heralds
from the coa&s;t, and after &s;everal me&s;&s;ages, a Lacedaemonian advanced
forward, and cried aloud, that they were per|mitted to treat with the enemy,
provided they did not &s;ubmit to di&s;honourable terms. Up|on this, they held
a conference, after which they &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion, and were kept
till the next day. The Athenians then rai&s;ing a trophy, and re&s;toring the
Lacedaemonians their dead, embarked for their own country, after di&s;tributing
the pri&s;oners among the &s;everal &s;hips, and committing the guard of them
to the captains of the gallies. In this battle one hundred and twenty-eight
Lacedaemonians fell out of four hundred and twenty, which was their number at
fir&s;t, &s;o that there &s;urvived not quite three hundred, an hundred and
twenty of whom were inhabitants of the city of Sparta. The &s;iege of the
i&s;land (to compute from the beginning of it, includ|ing the time employed in
the truce) had la&s;ted three&s;core and twelve days. They all now left Pylus,
and Cleon's promi&s;e, though &s;o vain and ra&s;h, was found literally true.
But the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tance was the capitulation that had been
made; for, it was believed, that the Lacedaemonians, &s;o far from
&s;urren|dering their arms, would die &s;word-in hand. <PB N="242" REF="245">
Being come to Athens, they were ordered to remain pri&s;oners till a peace
&s;hould be con|cluded, provided the Lacedaemonians did not make any
incur&s;ions into their country, for that then they &s;hould all be put to
death. They left a garri&s;on in Pylus. The Me&s;&s;enians of Naupactus, who
had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, &s;ent thither the flower of their youth,
who very much infe&s;ted the Lacedaemonians by their in|cur&s;ions; and, as
the&s;e Me&s;&s;enians &s;poke the language of the country, they prevailed with
a great number of &s;laves to join them. The La|cedaemonians dreading a greater
evil, &s;ent &s;e|veral deputations to Athens, but to no pur|po&s;e, the
Athenians being too much elated with their pro&s;perity, and e&s;pecially their
late &s;ucce&s;s, to li&s;ten to any terms. For two or three years
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively ho&s;tilities were carried on with alternate &s;ucce&s;s,
and nothing but the humbling of the one or the other of the two rival &s;tates
could decide the quarrel. The Athenians made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the
i&s;land of Cythera; but, on the other hand, were defeated by the
Lacedaemonians at Del|lion. At length, the two nations began to grow weary of a
war, which put them to great expence, and did not procure them any real
advantage. A truce for a year was, there|fore, <PB N="243" REF="246"> concluded
between them, which being expired, &s;erved to pave the way for a more
la&s;t|ing reconciliation. The death of the two ge|nerals that commanded the
contending armies, &s;erved not a little to ha&s;ten this event.
Bra&s;&s;i|das, the Lacedaemonian, was killed as he was conducting a &s;ally,
when be&s;ieged in Amphi|polis; and Cleon, the Athenian, de&s;pi&s;ing an enemy
to which he knew him&s;elf &s;uperior, was &s;et upon unawares, and, &s;lying
for &s;afety, was killed by a &s;oldier who happened to meet him. Thus, the&s;e
two men, who had long oppo&s;ed the tranquillity of Greece, and rai&s;ed their
re|putations but in a very different way, fell a &s;a|crifice to their own
ambition.</P>
<P>They were, however, men of very oppo&s;ite characters. Bra&s;idas
had courage and conduct, moderation and integrity; and, it was he alone who at
this time kept up the &s;inking re|putation of his country. He was the only
Spartan &s;ince Pau&s;anias who appeared with any e&s;tabli&s;hed character
among the confederates, to whom he behaved &s;o well, that they were again
brought under the dependence of Sparta; and &s;everal cities came in to him as
their common deliverer from the tyranny of Athens. The inhabitants of
Amphipolis, be&s;ides their join|ing with the other allies in &s;olemnizing his
fu|neral <PB N="244" REF="247"> in a public manner, in&s;tituted anniver|&s;ary
games, and &s;acrifices to his memory as an hero; and &s;o far con&s;idered him
as their foun|der, that they de&s;troyed all the monuments which had been
pre&s;erved as marks of their be|ing an Athenian colony. His oppo&s;ition to
the peace was not &s;o much the effects of his ob&s;tinacy, as of a true
Spartan zeal for the honour of his country, which he was &s;en&s;ible had been
treated by the Athenians with too much in&s;olence and contempt. He had now a
fair pro&s;pect of bringing them to rea&s;on, as he was gaining ground upon
them, and every day making fre&s;h conque&s;ts: and, however he might be
tran&s;ported with the glory of per|forming great actions, yet the main end of
his ambition &s;eems to have been, the bringing the war to an happy
conclu&s;ion, I mu&s;t not here omit the generous an&s;wer his mother made to
the per&s;ons who brought her the news of his death. Upon her a&s;king them
whether he died honourably, they naturally fell into enco|miums on his great
exploits, and his per&s;onal bravery, and preferred him to all the generals of
his time; 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;on was a valiant man, but
Sparta has &s;till many citi|zens braver than he."</Q></P>
<P>Cleon was another &s;ort of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n. He was ra&s;h, <PB N="245" REF="248"> arrogant, and ob&s;tinate,
contentious, envious, and malicious, covetous and corrupt, and yet, with all
the&s;e bad qualities, he had &s;ome little arts of popularity which rai&s;ed
and &s;upported him. He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to care&s;s the old men; and,
as much as he loved money, he often re|lieved the poor. He had a ready wit,
with a way of drollery, that took with many, though with the generality it
pa&s;&s;ed for impudence and buffoonry. He had one very refined way of
recommending him&s;elf, which was, upon his coming into power, to di&s;card all
his old friends, for fear it &s;hould be thought he would be bia&s;&s;ed by
them. At the &s;ame time, he picked up a vile &s;et of &s;ycophants in their
room, and made a &s;ervile court to the lowe&s;t dregs of the people; and yet,
even they had &s;o bad an opinion of him, that they often de|clared again&s;t
him for Nicias, his profe&s;&s;ed enemy; who, though he took part with the
no|bility, &s;till pre&s;erved an intere&s;t in the com|mons, and was more
generally re&s;pected. That which Cleon chiefly depended on, was his
elo|quence; but it was of a boi&s;terous kind, ver|bo&s;e and petulant, and
con&s;i&s;ted more in the vehemence of his &s;tyle and utterance, and the
di&s;tortion of his action and ge&s;ture, than in the &s;trength of his
rea&s;oning. By this furious <PB N="246" REF="249"> manner of harranguing, he
introduced among the orators and &s;tate&s;men a licentiou&s;ne&s;s and
indecency which were not known before, and which gave ri&s;e to the many
riotous and di&s;or|derly proceedings which were afterwards in the
a&s;&s;emblies, when almo&s;t every thing was carried by noi&s;e and tumult. In
the military part of his &s;ervice, he was as unaccountable as in the re&s;t of
his conduct. He was not na|turally formed for war, and only made u&s;e of it as
a cloak for his ill practices, and becau&s;e he could not carry on his other
views without it. His taking Sphacteria was certainly a great action, but it
was a ra&s;h and de&s;perate one; and it has been &s;hewn how he was
unde|&s;ignedly drawn into it by a boa&s;t of his own. However, he was &s;o
elated with the &s;uc|ce&s;s of that expedition, that he fancied him&s;elf a
general, and the people were brought to have the &s;ame opinion. But the event
&s;oon undeceived them, and convinced them that he knew better how to lead in
the a&s;&s;embly than in the field. In reality, he was not a man to be
tru&s;ted in either. For, in the one he was more of a blu&s;terer than of a
&s;ol|dier, and in the other, he had more of an in|cendiary than of a
patriot.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians were no le&s;s inclined to <PB N="247" REF="250">
peace than the Athenians and were glad to treat at this time while they could
do it with honour: be&s;ides, they had nothing more at heart than the
impri&s;onment of their men taken at Pylus, they being the chief of their city;
and, among other con&s;iderations, it was not the lea&s;t, that the truce which
they had made for Argos for thirty years, was ju&s;t upon expiring. This was a
&s;trong and flouri&s;hing city, and though it was not of it&s;elf a match for
Sparta, yet they knew it was far from being contemptible, and that it held too
good a corre&s;pondence with its neighbours, not to make it&s;elf capable of
giv|ing them a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s. The mat|ter having been
canva&s;&s;ed and debated mo&s;t part of the winter, the Lacedaemonians, to
bring the treaty to a conclu&s;ion, gave out, that they re&s;olved as &s;oon as
the &s;ea&s;on would per|mit to fortify in Attica. Upon which, the Athenians
grew more moderate in their de|mands, and a peace was concluded in the tenth
year of the war between the two &s;tates and their confederates for fifty
years. The chief articles being, that the garri&s;ons &s;hould be eva|cuated,
and the towns and pri&s;oners re&s;tored on both &s;ides. This was called the
Nician peace, becau&s;e Nicias, who was ju&s;t the rever&s;e of his rival
Cleon, was the chief in&s;trument in <PB N="248" REF="251" MS="y"> it.
Be&s;ides the tender concern he always ex|pre&s;&s;ed for his country, he had
more particu|lar ends in it, in &s;ecuring his reputation. For he had been upon
many expeditions, and had generally &s;ucceeded in them; but yet he was
&s;en&s;ible how much he owed to his good for|tune and his cautious management,
and he did not care to ri&s;que what he had already got for the hopes of
more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. From the Peace of NICIAS to the end of the
PELOPONNESSIAN War.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing now promi&s;ed a re&s;toration of former tranquillity.
The Boeotians and Co|rinthians were the fir&s;t that &s;hewed &s;igns of
di&s;content, and u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to excite fre&s;h troubles.
To obviate any dan|gers ari&s;ing from that quarter, the Athenians and
Lacedaemonians united in a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, which &s;erved
to render them more formidable to their neighbouring &s;tates, and more
a&s;&s;ured with regard to each other. Yet &s;till the former animo&s;ities and
jealou&s;ies fermented at bottom, and while friend&s;hip <PB N="249" REF="252">
&s;eemed to glo&s;s over external appearances, fre&s;h di&s;contents were
gathering below. The character indeed of Nicias was peaceable, and he did all
in his power to per&s;uade the Athe|nians to cultivate their general
tranquillity. But a new promoter of troubles was now be|ginning to make his
appearance, and from him, tho&s;e who wi&s;hed for peace had every thing to
fear. This was no other than the celebrated Alcibiades, the di&s;ciple of
Socrates, a youth equally remarkable for the beauty of his per|&s;on and the
greatne&s;s of his mental accom|pli&s;hments.</P>
<P>The &s;trict intimacy between Alcibiades and Socrates is one of the
mo&s;t remarkable cir|cum&s;tances of his life. This philo&s;opher ob|&s;erving
excellent natural qualities in him, which were greatly heightened by the beauty
of his per&s;on, be&s;towed incredible pains in cul|tivating &s;o valuable a
plant, le&s;t, being neglect|ed, it &s;hould wither as it grew, and
ab&s;olutely degenerate: and, indeed, Alcibiades was ex|po&s;ed to numberle&s;s
dangers; the greatne&s;s of his extraction, his va&s;t riches, the authority of
his family, the credit of his guardians, his per&s;onal talents, his
exqui&s;ite beauty, and, &s;till more than the&s;e, the flattery and
complai&s;ance of all who approached him. One would have <PB N="250" REF="253">
concluded, &s;ays Plutarch, that fortune had &s;urrounded and inve&s;ted him
with all the&s;e pretended advantages, as with &s;o many ram|parts and
bulwarks, to render him inacce&s;&s;ible and invulnerable to all the darts of
philo&s;ophy, tho&s;e &s;alutary darts which &s;trike to the very heart, and
leave in it the &s;tronge&s;t incitements to virtue and &s;olid glory. But
tho&s;e very ob|&s;tacles redoubled the zeal of Socrates. Not|with&s;tanding
the &s;trong endeavours that were u&s;ed to divert this young Athenian from a
cor|re&s;pondence which alone was capable of &s;ecur|ing him from &s;o many
&s;nares, he devoted him&s;elf entirely to it; he had the mo&s;t unbounded wit;
he was fully &s;en&s;ible of Socrates's extraordinary merit, and could not
re&s;i&s;t the charms of his &s;weetly in&s;inuating eloquence, which at that
time had a greater a&s;cendent over him than the allurements of plea&s;ure. He
was &s;o zeal|ous a di&s;ciple of that great ma&s;ter, that he fol|lowed him
wherever he went, took the utmo&s;t delight in his conver&s;ation, was
extremely well plea&s;ed with his principles, received his in&s;tructions, and
even his reprimands, with wonderful docility, and was &s;o moved with his
di&s;cour&s;es, as even to &s;hed tears and abhor him&s;elf; &s;o weighty was
the force of truth in the mouth of Socrates, and in &s;o <PB N="251" REF="254">
odious a light did he expo&s;e the vices to which Alcibiades abandoned
him&s;elf. Alci|biades in tho&s;e moments when he li&s;tened to Socrates,
differed &s;o much from him&s;elf, that he appeared quite another man. However,
his head-&s;trong fiery temper, and his natural fond|ne&s;s for plea&s;ure,
which was heightened and inflamed by the di&s;cour&s;es and advice of young
people, &s;oon plunged him into his former irre|gularities, and tore him as it
were from his ma&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, who was
obliged to pur&s;ue him as a &s;lave who had e&s;caped correction. This
vici&s;&s;i|tude of flights and returns of virtuous re&s;olu|tions and
relap&s;es into vice, continued a long time, but &s;till Socrates was not
di&s;gu&s;ted by his levity, and always flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of
bringing him back to his duty; and hence certainly aro&s;e the &s;trong mixture
of good and evil that always appeared in his conduct; the in&s;tructions which
his ma&s;ter had given him &s;ometimes prevailing, and, at other times, the
fire of his pa&s;&s;ions hurrying him, in a manner, again&s;t his own will into
things of a quite oppo&s;ite nature. Among the various pa&s;&s;ions that were
di&s;covered in him, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t prevailing was a haughty turn
of mind, which would force all things to &s;ubmit to it, and could not bear a
&s;uperior, <PB N="252" REF="255"> or even an equal. Although his birth and
un|common talents &s;moothed the way to his at|taining the highe&s;t
employments in the re|public, there was nothing however to which he was &s;o
fond of owing the credit and autho|rity he wanted to gain over the people, as
to the force of his eloquence, and the per&s;ua&s;ive grace of his orations. To
this, his intimacy with Socrates might be of great &s;ervice. Al|cibiades with
&s;uch a ca&s;t of mind as we here de&s;cribed, was not born for repo&s;e, and
had &s;et every engine at work to traver&s;e the treaty lately concluded
between the two &s;tates, but not &s;ucceeding in his attempt, he endeavoured
to prevent its taking effect. He was di&s;gu&s;ted at the Lacedaemonians,
becau&s;e they directed them&s;elves only to Nicias, of whom they had a very
high opinion; and, on the contrary, &s;eemed to take no manner of notice of
him, though his ance&s;tors had enjoyed the rights of ho&s;pitality among them.
The fir&s;t thing he did to infringe the peace was this: having been informed
that the people of Argos only wanted an opportunity to break with the
Spar|tans, whom they equally hated and feared, he flattered them &s;ecretly
with the hopes that the Athenians would &s;uccour them, by &s;ugge&s;t|ing to
them, that they were ready to break a <PB N="253" REF="256"> peace which was no
way advantageous to them. Accordingly, he laid hold of this junc|ture, and
improved the pretext the Lacedae|monians had given to exa&s;perate the people
both again&s;t them and Nicias; which had &s;o good an effect, that every thing
&s;eemed di&s;po&s;|ed for a treaty with Argos: of which, the La|cedaemonians
being very apprehen&s;ive, imme|diately di&s;patched their amba&s;&s;adors to
Athens, who at fir&s;t &s;aid what &s;eemed very &s;atisfactory, that they came
with full power to concert all matters in difference upon equal terms. The
council received their propo&s;itions, and the people were to a&s;&s;emble the
next day to give them audience. Alcibiades, in the mean while, fearing le&s;t
this negociation would ruin his de&s;igns, had a &s;ecret conference with the
amba&s;&s;adors, and per&s;uaded them, under a co|lour of friend&s;hip, not to
let the people know at fir&s;t what full powers their commi&s;&s;ion gave them,
but intimate, that they came only to treat and make propo&s;als, for that
otherwi&s;e they would grow in&s;olent in their demands, and extort from them
&s;uch unrea&s;onable terms as they could not with honour con&s;ent to. They
were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the prudence and &s;incerity of this advice,
that he drew them from Nicias to rely intirely upon him&s;elf: and, the 
<PB N="254" REF="257"> next day, when the people were a&s;&s;embled, and the
amba&s;&s;adors introduced, Alcibiades, with a very obliging air, demanded of
them with what powers they were come? They made an&s;wer, that they were not
come as plenipo|tentiaries. Upon which he in&s;tantly changed his voice and
countenance, and exclaiming again&s;t them as notorious liars, bid the people
take care how they tran&s;acted any thing with men on whom they could have &s;o
little depen|dence. The people di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors in a rage,
and Nicias knowing nothing of the deceit, was confounded and in di&s;grace. To
redeem his credit, he propo&s;ed being &s;ent once more to Sparta: but not
being able to gain &s;uch terms there as the Athenians demanded, they
immediately upon his return &s;truck up a league with the Argives for an
hundred years, including the Eleans and Mantineans, which yet did not in terms
cancel that with the Lace|daemonians, though it is plain, that the whole intent
of it was levelled again&s;t them. Upon this new alliance, Alcibiades was
declared ge|neral; and though his be&s;t friends could not commend the method
by which he brought about his de&s;igns, yet it was looked upon as a great
reach in politics, thus to divide and &s;hake almo&s;t all Peloponne&s;us, and
to remove <PB N="255" REF="258"> the war &s;o far from the Athenian frontier,
that even &s;ucce&s;s would profit the enemy but little &s;hould they be
conquerors; whereas, if they were defeated, Sparta it&s;elf would be hardly
&s;afe.</P>
<P>This defection of the confederates began to awaken the jealou&s;y of
Sparta, they re&s;olved, therefore, to remedy the evil before it &s;pread too
far; wherefore, drawing out their whole force, both of citizens and &s;laves,
and being joined by their allies, they encamped almo&s;t under the walls of
Argos. The Argives hav|ing notice of their march, made all po&s;&s;ible
preparations, and came out with a full re&s;olu|tion to fight them. But ju&s;t
as they were go|ing to engage, two of their officers went over to Agis, the
Spartan king and general, and propo&s;ed to him to have the bu&s;ine&s;s made
up by a reference. He immediately clo&s;ing with the offer, in order to it,
granted them a truce for four months, and drew off his army; the whole affair
being tran&s;acted by the&s;e three, without any general con&s;ent or knowledge
on either &s;ide. The Peloponne&s;ians, though they dur&s;t not di&s;obey their
orders, inveighed griev|ou&s;ly again&s;t Agis for letting &s;uch an advantage
&s;lip as they could never promi&s;e to them&s;elves again. For they had
actually hemmed in the <PB N="256" REF="259"> enemy, and that with the be&s;t,
if not the greate&s;t army, that ever was brought into the field. And the
Argives were &s;o little appre|hen&s;ive of danger on their &s;ide, that they
were no le&s;s incen&s;ed again&s;t their mediators, one of whom they forced to
the altars to &s;ave his life, and confi&s;cated his goods.</P>
<P>Thus every thing &s;eemed to favour the Athe|nian intere&s;t; and
their pro&s;perity, for this was the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing period of their
duration, blinded them to &s;uch a degree, that they were per&s;uaded no power
was able to re&s;i&s;t them. In this di&s;po&s;ition they re&s;olved to take
the fir&s;t opportunity of adding the i&s;land of Sicily to their empire, and
&s;oon an occa&s;ion offered to their wi&s;h. Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent from
the people of Ege&s;ta, who, in quality of their allies, came to implore their
aid again&s;t the inhabi|tants of Selinuta, who were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
Syracu&s;ans. It was the &s;ixteenth year of the Peloponne&s;ian war. They
repre&s;ented, among other things, that &s;hould they be abandoned, the
Syracu&s;ans, after &s;eizing their city, as they had done that of Leontium,
would po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all Sicily, and not fail to aid the
Peloponne&s;ians, who were their founders; and, that they might put them to as
little charge as po&s;&s;ible, they offered to pay the troops that 
<PB N="257" REF="260"> &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;uccour them. The Athe|nians,
who had long waited for an opportuni|ty to declare them&s;elves, &s;ent
deputies to Ege&s;ta to enquire into the &s;tate of affairs, and to &s;ee
whether there was money enough in the trea&s;ury to defray the expence of &s;o
great a war. The inhabitants of that city had been &s;o artful as to borrow
from the neighbouring na|tions a great number of gold and &s;ilver va&s;es,
worth an immen&s;e &s;um of money, and of the&s;e they made a &s;hew when the
Athenians arrived. The deputies returned with tho&s;e of Ege&s;ta, who carried
three&s;core talents in ingots, as a month's pay for the gallies which they
de|manded and a promi&s;e of larger &s;ums, which they &s;aid were ready both
in the public trea&s;ury and in the temples. The people &s;truck with the&s;e
fair appearances, the truth of which they did not give them&s;elves the
lei&s;ure to examine; and, &s;educed by the advantageous reports which their
deputies made with the view of plea&s;ing them, immediately granted the
Ege&s;|tans their demand, and appointed Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus, to
command the fleet, with full power not only to &s;uccour Ege&s;ta, and
re&s;tore the inhabitants of Leontium to their city, but al&s;o to regulate the
affairs of Sicily, in &s;uch a manner as might be&s;t &s;uit the 
<PB N="258" REF="261"> intere&s;ts of the republic. Nicias was appoint|ed one
of the generals to his very great regret; for, be&s;ides other motives, which
made him dread that command, he &s;hunned it becau&s;e Alcibiades was to be his
colleague. But the Athenians promi&s;ed them&s;elves greater &s;ucce&s;s from
this war, &s;hould they not re&s;ign the whole conduct of it to Alcibiades, but
temper his ardour and audacity with the coldne&s;s and wi&s;dom of Nicias.
Nicias not daring to op|po&s;e Alcibiades openly, endeavoured to do it
indirectly, by &s;tarting a great number of dif|ficulties, drawn particularly
from the great ex|pence of this expedition. He declared, that &s;ince they were
re&s;olved upon war, they ought to carry it on in &s;uch a manner as might
&s;uit the exalted reputation to which Athens had at|tained. That a fleet was
not &s;ufficient to op|po&s;e &s;o formidable a power as that of the
Syra|cu&s;ans and their allies: that they mu&s;t rai&s;e an army compo&s;ed of
good hor&s;e and foot, if they de&s;ired to act in a manner worthy of &s;o
noble a de&s;ign; that, be&s;ides their fleet, which was to make them ma&s;ters
at &s;ea, they mu&s;t have a great number of tran&s;ports to carry
pro|vi&s;ions perpetually to the army, which otherwi&s;e could not po&s;&s;ibly
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in an enemy's country: that they mu&s;t carry va&s;t &s;ums of
money with <PB N="259" REF="262"> them, without waiting for that promi&s;ed
them by the citizens of Ege&s;ta, who perhaps were ready in words only, and
very probably might break their promi&s;e: that they ought to weigh and examine
the di&s;parity there was between them&s;elves and their enemies with regard to
the conveniencies and wants of the army, the Syracu&s;ans being in their own
country, in the mid&s;t of powerful allies, di&s;po&s;ed by inclina|tion, as
well as engaged by intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with men, arms, hor&s;es,
and provi&s;ions; whereas, the Athenians would carry on the war in a remote
country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their enemies, where, in the winter, news could
not be brought them in le&s;s than four months time; a country where all things
would oppo&s;e the Athenians, and nothing be procured but by force of arms:
that it would reflect the greate&s;t ignominy on the Athenians, &s;hould they
be forced to abandon their enterprize, and thereby become the &s;corn and
contempt of their enemies, by their neglecting to take all the precautions
which &s;o important a de&s;ign required: that as for him&s;elf, he was
deter|mined not to go unle&s;s he was provided with all things nece&s;&s;ary
for the expedition, becau&s;e the &s;afety of the whole army depended on that
circum&s;tance; and that he would not rely <PB N="260" REF="263"> on caprice,
or the precarious engagements of the allies. Nicias had flattered him&s;elf,
that this &s;peech would cool the ardour of the people, whereas it only
inflamed it the more. Imme|diately the generals had full powers given them to
rai&s;e as many troops, and fit out as many gallies as they &s;hould judge
nece&s;&s;ary; and the levies were accordingly carried on in Athens, and other
places, with inexpre&s;&s;ible activity.</P>
<P>When prepared, they accordingly &s;et &s;ail, after having appointed
Corcyra the rendezvous for mo&s;t of the allies, and &s;uch &s;hips as were to
carry the provi&s;ions and warlike &s;tores. All the citizens, as well as
foreigners in Athens, flocked by day-break to the port of Pyraeus. The former
attended by their children, rela|tions, friends, and companions, with a joy
overca&s;t with a little &s;orrow, upon their bid|ding adieu to per&s;ons that
were as dear to them as life, who were &s;etting out on a di&s;tant and very
dangerous expedition, from which it was uncertain whether they would ever
return, though they flattered them&s;elves with the hopes that it would be
&s;ucce&s;sful. The foreigners came thither to feed their eyes with a &s;ight
which was highly worthy their curio&s;ity, for no &s;ingle city in the world
had <PB N="261" REF="264"> ever fitted out &s;o gallant a fleet. Tho&s;e indeed
which had been &s;ent again&s;t Epidaurus and Potidaea, were as con&s;iderable
with regard to the number of &s;oldiers and &s;hips, but then they were not
equipped with &s;o much magni|ficence, neither was their voyage &s;o long, nor
their enterprize &s;o important. Here were &s;een a land and a naval army
provided with the ut|mo&s;t care, and at the expence of particular per&s;ons,
as well as of the public, with all things nece&s;&s;ary on account of the
length of the voyage, and the duration of the war. The city furni&s;hed an
hundred empty gallies, that is three&s;core light ones, and forty to
tran&s;|port the &s;oldiers heavily armed. Every ma|riner received daily a
drachma, or ten pence Engli&s;h, for his pay, exclu&s;ively of what the
captains of &s;hips gave the rowers of the fir&s;t bench. Add to this, the pomp
and magni|ficence that was di&s;played univer&s;ally, every one &s;triving to
eclip&s;e the re&s;t, and each cap|tain endeavouring to make his &s;hip the
lighte&s;t, and, at the &s;ame time, the gaye&s;t in the whole fleet. I &s;hall
not take notice of the choice of the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, who were the
flower of the Athenians, nor of their emulation with regard to the beauty and
neatne&s;s of their arms and equipage, any more than of their officers, 
<PB N="262" REF="265"> who had laid out con&s;iderable &s;ums purely to
di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and to give foreigners an advantageous idea of
their per&s;ons and cir|cum&s;tances, &s;o that this &s;ight had the air of a
pageant, in which the utmo&s;t magnificence is di&s;played, rather than of a
warlike expedi|tion. But the boldne&s;s and greatne&s;s of the de&s;ign &s;till
exceeded its expence and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips were loaded, and the troops got on board, the
trumpet &s;ounded, and &s;o|lemn prayers were offered up for the &s;ucce&s;s of
the expedition; gold and &s;ilver cups were fill|ing every where with wine, and
the accu&s;tom|ed libations were poured out; the people who lined the &s;hore
&s;houting, at the &s;ame time, and lifting up their hands to heaven to wi&s;h
their fellow-citizens a good voyage and &s;ucce&s;s. And now the hymn being
&s;ung, and the cere|monies ended, the &s;hips &s;ailed one after an|other out
of the harbour, after which they &s;trove to out&s;ail one another, till the
whole fleet met at Aegina. From thence it made to to Corcyra, where the army of
the allies was a&s;&s;embled with the re&s;t of the fleet.</P>
<P>Being now arrived at Sicily, the generals were divided in their
opinions as to the place where they &s;hould make a de&s;cent. Lamachus, one of
the generals, was for making directly <PB N="263" REF="266"> for Syracu&s;e. He
urged, that it was as yet unprovided, and under the greate&s;t
con|&s;ternation; that an army was always mo&s;t terrible on its approach
before the enemy had time to recollect and make danger familiar; the&s;e
rea&s;ons, however, were over-ruled. It was agreed to reduce the &s;maller
cities fir&s;t, when having detached ten gallies only to take a view of the
&s;ituation and harbour of Syra|cu&s;e, they landed with the re&s;t of their
forces, and &s;urpri&s;ed Catana.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the enemies of Alcibiades had taken occa&s;ion
from his ab&s;ence, to attack him with redoubled vigour. They aggravated his
mi&s;conduct in neglecting the proper me|thod of attack, and enforced their
accu&s;ation, by alledging, that he had prophaned the my|&s;teries of Ceres;
this was &s;ufficient to induce the giddy multitude to recal their general, but
for fear of rai&s;ing a tumult in the army, they only &s;ent him orders to
return to Athens to pacify the people by his pre&s;ence. Alcibiades obeyed the
orders with &s;eeming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but reflecting on the incon&s;tancy and
caprice of his judges, the in&s;tant he was arrived at Thurium, and had got on
&s;hore, he di&s;appeared, and eluded the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e who &s;ought
after him; the galley, therefore, returned without <PB N="264" REF="267"> him,
and the people in a rage condemned him to death for his contumacy. His whole
e&s;tate was confi&s;cated, and all the orders of religion were commanded to
cur&s;e him. Some time after, news being brought him that the Atheni|ans had
condemned him to death; I hope one day, &s;aith he, to make them &s;en&s;ible
that I am &s;till alive.</P>
<P>The Syracu&s;ans had by this time put them|&s;elves in a po&s;ture
of defence, and finding that Nicias did not advance towards them, they talked
of attacking him in his camp; and &s;ome of them a&s;ked, in a &s;coffing way,
Whether he was come into Sicily to &s;ettle at Catana? He was rou&s;ed by this
in&s;ult, and re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of his way to Syracu&s;e. He
dur&s;t not attempt it by land for want of ca|valry, and he thought it equally
hazardous to make a de&s;cent by &s;ea upon an enemy who was &s;o well prepared
to receive him: however, he cho&s;e the latter way, and &s;ucceeded in it by a
&s;tratagem. He had gained a citizen of Ca|tana to go as a de&s;erter to the
Syracu&s;ans, and informed them, that the Athenians lay every night in the town
without their arms; and that early in the morning, on a certain day ap|pointed,
they might &s;urprize them, &s;eize on their camp with all their arms and
baggage, <PB N="265" REF="268"> burn their fleet in the harbour, and de&s;troy
the whole army. The Syracu&s;ans gave cre|dit to him, and marched with all
their forces towards Catana; which Nicias had no &s;ooner notice of, but he
embarked his troops, and &s;teering away for Syracu&s;e, landed them there the
next morning, and fortified him&s;elf in the out-&s;kirts of the town. The
Syracu&s;ans were &s;o provoked at this trick being put upon them, that they
immediately returned to Syra|cu&s;e, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves without the
walls in order of battle. Nicias marched out of his trenches to meet them, and
a very &s;harp action en&s;ued, wherein, at length, the Athe|nians got the
better, and forced the enemy back to the city, after having killed two hun|dred
and &s;ixty of them and their confederates, with the lo&s;s of fifty of their
own men. They were not as yet in a condition to attack the city, and therefore
took up their winter quarters at Catana and Naxus.</P>
<P>The year following greater projects were undertaken, for, having
received a &s;upply of hor&s;e from Athens, with provi&s;ions, and other
&s;tores of war, Nicias &s;et &s;ail for Syracu&s;e, in order to block it up by
&s;ea and land. In this manner did the little &s;tate of Athens &s;pread terror
among all the neighbouring &s;tates, and <PB N="266" REF="269"> now ri&s;en to
its utmo&s;t height, began to a&s;pire at univer&s;al empire. Athens had
already been the mi&s;tre&s;s of arts and philo&s;ophy, it now, with inverted
ambition, aimed at &s;etting man|kind an example of the arts of conque&s;t and
of war, but they had never con&s;idered that a petty &s;tate rai&s;ed
artificially into power, is liable to a thou&s;and accidents in its way to
conque&s;t; they had now &s;ent out their whole force into Sicily, and while
they fought to decide the fate of Syracu&s;e, they were in fact contending for
their own; the exi&s;tence of Athens and Syracu&s;e depended &s;o much on the
event of the pre&s;ent inva&s;ion, that both &s;ides fought with the utmo&s;t
per&s;everance, and hi&s;torians have been minute in the detail.</P>
<P>The &s;iege was now carried on in a more re|gular and &s;kilful
manner than had ever been practi&s;ed before, and men were taught a new
le&s;&s;on now, as well in the arts of attack as of defence. Nicias found it
nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, to gain Epipolae, an high hill which
commanded the city, and had a &s;teep craggy pa&s;&s;age up to it. The
Syracu&s;ans were &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the importance of this po&s;t, that
they had ordered a detachment of &s;even hundred men to march upon a &s;ignal
given to the de|fence of it. But Nicias had landed his men 
<PB N="267" REF="270"> in a little remote harbour &s;o &s;ecretly and &s;o
&s;uddenly, that they ea&s;ily made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it. And the
&s;even hundred running up from the plains in a confu&s;ed manner to
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them, were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of three hundred of
them and their leader. Nicias built a fort there, as a magazine, and proceeded
to inve&s;t the town on the land-&s;ide, &s;o as to prevent any communication
with the country. The enemy endeavouring to defeat his works, and render them
u&s;ele&s;s, &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued, wherein the Athenians had
generally the better: but, in one of them, Lamachus being pre&s;&s;ed hard, and
abandoned by his men, was killed. The Syracu&s;ans be|ing &s;till intent on the
recovery of Epipolae, or|dered up another detachment thither. Nicias was at
this time &s;ick in the fort, and in bed, with only his &s;ervants about him.
But when he found the enemy were forcing his intrench|ments, he got up and
&s;et fire to the engines, and other wood that lay &s;cattered about the fort;
which had &s;o good an effect, that it &s;erved as a &s;ignal to his own troops
to come up to his relief, and &s;o terrified and confound|ed tho&s;e of the
enemy, that they retreated into the city. From thenceforth, Nicias, who was now
&s;ole general, conceived great hopes; for <PB N="268" REF="271"> &s;everal
cities of Sicily, which hitherto had not declared for either &s;ide, came and
joined him, and there arrived from all quarters ve&s;&s;els laden with
provi&s;ions for his army, all parties being eager to go over to him, becau&s;e
he had ac|quired the &s;uperiority, and been exceedingly &s;ucce&s;sful in all
his undertakings. The Syra|cu&s;ans &s;eeing them&s;elves blocked up both by
&s;ea and land, and lo&s;ing all hopes of being able to defend their city any
longer, already propo&s;ed an accommodation. Gylippus, who was com|ing from
Lacedaemon to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, hav|ing heard in his pa&s;&s;age the
extremity to which they were reduced, and looking upon the whole i&s;land as
lo&s;t, &s;ailed forward neverthe|le&s;s, not in the view of defending Sicily,
but on|ly to pre&s;erve to the nations of Italy &s;uch ci|ties as were
&s;ubject to them in that i&s;land, if it were not too late, and if this could
be done; for fame had declared in all places, that the Athenians had already
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the whole i&s;land, and were headed by a
gene|ral who&s;e wi&s;dom and good fortune rendered him invincible.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ortifications of the
Athenians were now almo&s;t completed, they had drawn a double wall near half a
league in length along the plain and the fens towards the great port, 
<PB N="269" REF="272"> and had almo&s;t reached it. There now re|mained on one
&s;ide only a &s;mall part of the wall to be fini&s;hed, and the Syracu&s;ans
were upon the brink of ruin; they had no hopes left; they were unable to defend
them&s;elves, and they knew not where to look for &s;uccours; for this
rea&s;on, they re&s;olved to &s;urrender, and a council was held to &s;ettle
the articles of capi|tulation which were to be pre&s;ented to Nicias.</P>
<P>It was at that very in&s;tant, and in this mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful
juncture, that a me&s;&s;enger arrived at Syracu&s;e from Corinth with news of
&s;peedy re|lief. The whole body of citizens flocked round the me&s;&s;enger of
&s;uch welcome information. He gave them to under&s;tand, that Gylippus, the
Lacedaemonian general, would be with them immediately, and was followed by a
great many other gallies which came to his aid. The Syracu&s;ans
a&s;toni&s;hed, or rather &s;tupefied as it were with this news, could &s;carce
believe what they heard. Whil&s;t they were thus &s;luc|tuating and in doubt, a
courier arrived from Gylippus to inform them of his approach, and ordered them
to march over all their troops to meet him. He him&s;elf after taking a fort in
his way, marched in order of battle directly for Epi|polae, and a&s;cending by
Euryclus as the Athe|nians had done, he prepared to attack them 
<PB N="270" REF="273"> from without, whil&s;t the Syracu&s;ians &s;hould charge
them on their &s;ide with the forces of Syracu&s;e. The Athenians, exceedingly
&s;urpri&s;ed by his arrival, drew up ha&s;tily, and without order under the
wall; with re|gard to him&s;elf, laying down his arms when he approached, he
&s;ent word by a herald, that he would allow the Athenians five days to leave
Sicily. Nicias did not conde&s;cend to make the lea&s;t an&s;wer to this
propo&s;al; and &s;ome of his &s;oldiers bur&s;ting out a laughing, a&s;ked the
herald, whether the pre&s;ence of a Lacedaemo|nian privateer, and the trifling
wand of an herald, could make any change in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the city?
Both &s;ides, therefore, pre|pared for battle.</P>
<P>Gylippus began by &s;torming the fort of Lab|dalla, and cutting in
pieces all who were found in it. The Athenians, in the mean time, were not idle
in forming entrenchments to oppo&s;e him, while the be&s;ieged were equally
a&s;&s;iduous in cutting down and breaking through tho&s;e walls and
circumvallations which were carried round their city. At length, both &s;ides
drew up their forces in battle array between the walls, which the Athenians had
rai&s;ed to keep off the enemy. In the fir&s;t engagement the cavalry of
Gylippus being rendered u&s;ele&s;s <PB N="271" REF="274"> from the
narrowne&s;s of the place, to re-ani|mate his &s;oldiers, by doing them
ju&s;tice, he had the courage to reproach him&s;elf for the ill &s;ucce&s;s
they had met with, and to declare publicly, that he, not they, had occa&s;ioned
the late defeat, becau&s;e he had made them fight in too narrow a &s;pot of
ground. How|ever, he promi&s;ed &s;oon to give them an oppor|tunity of
recovering both their honour and his; and, accordingly, the very next day he
led them again&s;t the enemy, after having ex|horted them in the &s;tronge&s;t
terms to behave in a manner worthy of their ancient glory. Nicias perceiving,
that though he &s;hould not de&s;ire to come to a battle, it would, however, be
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to prevent the enemy from extending their
line beyond the contravallation, to which they were already very near,
(becau&s;e otherwi&s;e this would be grant|ing them a certain victory)
therefore, march|ed boldly again&s;t the Syracu&s;ans. Gylippus brought up his
troops beyond that place where the walls terminated on both &s;ides, in order
that he might leave the more room to extend his battle, when, charging the
enemy's left wing with his hor&s;e, he put it to flight, and &s;oon after
defeated their right. We have an in&s;tance of what the experience and
abilities of <PB N="272" REF="275"> a great captain are capable of producing;
for Gylippus, with the &s;ame men, the &s;ame arms, the &s;ame hor&s;es, and
the &s;ame ground, by on|ly changing his order of battle, defeated the
Athenians, and beat them quite to their camp. The following night the victors
carried on their wall beyond the contravallation of the Athe|nians, and thereby
deprived them of all hopes of being ever able to &s;urround the city. Nicias
had ever &s;ince the arrival of Gylippus been put upon the defen&s;ive, and as
he daily lo&s;t ground in the country, he retired towards the &s;ea, to keep
that open in ca&s;e of accidents, and to bring in provi&s;ions. For this
purpo&s;e, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Plemmyrium, near the great
harbour, where he built three forts, and kept him&s;elf up as it were in
garri&s;on. Gylip|pus took this opportunity to gain over the in|land cities;
and, at the &s;ame time, arrived the fleet which was expected from Corinth.
Nici|as, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, wrote a very melancholy account of his
affairs to Athens; that the enemy were become &s;o &s;uperior to him, that he
was not in a condition to force their intrenchments; and, that in&s;tead of
be|&s;ieging them, he was now be&s;ieged him&s;elf; that the towns revolted
from him; the &s;laves and mercenaries de&s;erted; that his troops were 
<PB N="273" REF="276"> employed in guarding the forts and fetching in
provi&s;ions, and that in this latter &s;ervice many of them were cut off by
the enemy's hor&s;e. That the fleet was in as bad a condition as the army; and
that, in &s;hort, without a &s;peedy re|inforcement of men, &s;hips, and money,
equal to what he had at fir&s;t &s;et out with, it was in vain to attempt any
thing farther: then, as to his own particular, he complained of his being
afflicted with &s;harp nephritic pains, which ren|dered him incapable of going
on with the &s;er|vice; and, therefore, pre&s;&s;ed to be recalled." The
Athenians were &s;o affected with this letter, that they named Eurymedon and
Demo&s;thenes to go over with fre&s;h &s;upplies, the former im|mediately with
ten gallies, and the other early in the &s;pring with a &s;tronger force. At
the &s;ame time, they appointed Menander and Eu|thydemus to act as
a&s;&s;i&s;tants to Nicias, but would not grant his reque&s;t of coming home.
In the mean time, Gylippus, who had made the tour of Sicily, returned with as
many men as he could rai&s;e in the whole i&s;land, and pre|vailed with the
Syracu&s;ans to fit out the &s;tronge&s;t &s;leet in their power, and to hazard
a battle at &s;ea, upon the pre&s;umption that the &s;ucce&s;s would an&s;wer
the greatne&s;s of the enterprize. This advice was &s;trongly enforced by
Hermo|crates, <PB N="274" REF="277"> who exhorted the Syracu&s;ans not to
abandon to their enemies the empire of the &s;eas. He ob&s;erved, that the
Athenians them|&s;elves had not received it from their ance&s;tors, nor been
always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; that the Per|&s;ian war had in a manner forced
them into the knowledge of naval affairs, notwith&s;tanding two great
ob&s;tacles, their di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;ituation of their city, which
&s;tood at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance from the &s;ea: that they had made
them&s;elves formidable to other nations, not &s;o much by their real
&s;trength, as by their courage and intrepidity: that they ought to copy them;
and &s;ince they had to do with ene|mies who were &s;o enterpri&s;ing, it was
fit they &s;hould be equally daring.</P>
<P>This advice was approved, and accordingly a large fleet was
equipped. Gylippus led out all his land-forces in the night-time to attack the
forts of Plemmyrium. Thirty-five gallies of Syracu&s;e, which were in the great
harbour, and forty-five in the le&s;&s;er, where was an ar|&s;enal for &s;hips,
were ordered to advance to|wards Plemmyrium, to amaze the Athenians, who would
find them&s;elves attacked both by &s;ea and land at the &s;ame time. The
Athenians at this news went on board al&s;o, and with twenty|five &s;hips
&s;ailed to fight the thirty-five Syracu|&s;an <PB N="275" REF="278">
ve&s;&s;els, which were &s;ailing out again&s;t them from the great harbour,
and oppo&s;ed thirty-five more to the forty-five of the enemy which were come
out of the little port. A &s;harp engage|ment was fought at the mouth of the
great harbour, one party endeavouring to force their way into it, and the other
to keep them out.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who defended the forts of Plemmy|rium having flocked to the
&s;hore to view the battle, Gylippus attacked the forts unexpect|edly by
day-break; and having carried the greate&s;t of them by &s;torm, the &s;oldiers
who de|fended the other two, were &s;o terrified, that they abandoned them in a
moment. After this advantage the Syracu&s;ans &s;u&s;tained a con|&s;iderable
lo&s;s, for &s;uch of their ve&s;&s;els as fought at the entrance of the
harbour, (after having forced the Athenians) bulged furiou&s;ly one again&s;t
the other, as they entered it in di&s;|order; and, by this means, &s;hifted the
victory to their enemies, who were not contented with pur&s;uing, but al&s;o
gave chace to tho&s;e who were victorious in the great harbour. Eleven
Syracu&s;an gallies were &s;unk, and great num|bers of the &s;ailors in them
killed. Three were taken; but the Athenians likewi&s;e lo&s;t three, and after
towing off tho&s;e of the enemy, they <PB N="276" REF="279"> rai&s;ed a trophy
in a little i&s;land lying before Plemmyrium, and retired to the center of
their camp.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance which the be&s;ieged con&s;i|dered of the
greate&s;t importance, was to at|tempt a &s;econd engagement both by &s;ea and
land, before the fleet and other &s;uccours &s;ent by the Athenians &s;hould
arrive. They had concerted fre&s;h mea&s;ures for a battle at &s;ea, by
improving from the errors they had committed in the la&s;t engagement. The
change made in the gallies was, their prows were now &s;horter, and, at the
&s;ame time, &s;tronger and more &s;olid than before. For this purpo&s;e, they
fixed great pieces of timber projecting forward on each &s;ide of the prows,
and to the&s;e pieces they joined beams by way of props. The beams extended to
the length of &s;ix cubits on each &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el both within and
without. By this they hoped to gain an advantage over the gallies of the
Athenians, which did not dare, becau&s;e of the weakne&s;s of their prows, to
attack an enemy in front, but only in flank, not to mention, that &s;hould the
battle be fought in the harbour, they would not have room to &s;pread
them&s;elves, nor to pa&s;s between two gallies, in which lay their greate&s;t
art, nor to tack about after they &s;hould have been repul&s;ed, 
<PB N="277" REF="280"> in order to return to the charge; whereas, the
Syracu&s;ans by their being ma&s;ters of the whole extent of the harbour, would
have all the&s;e advantages, and might reciprocally a&s;&s;i&s;t one another.
On the&s;e circum&s;tances the latter founded their hopes of victory.</P>
<P>Gylippus, therefore, fir&s;t drew all the infan|try out of the camp,
and advanced towards that part of the contravallation of the Atheni|ans which
faced the city, whil&s;t the troops of Olympia marched towards the other, and
their gallies &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>Nicias did not care to venture a &s;econd bat|tle, &s;aying, that as
he expected a fre&s;h fleet every moment, and a great reinforcement un|der
Demo&s;thenes, it would betray the greate&s;t want of judgment, &s;hould he, as
his troops were inferior in number to tho&s;e of the enemy, and already
fatigued, hazard a battle without being forced to it. On the contrary,
Menan|der and Euthydemus, who had ju&s;t before been appointed to &s;hare the
command with Nicias till the arrival of Demo&s;thenes, fired with ambition, and
jealous of tho&s;e generals, were eager to perform &s;ome great exploit, to
bereave the one of his glory, and if po&s;&s;ible eclip&s;e that of the other.
The pretence they alledged on this occa&s;ion was, the fame and 
<PB N="278" REF="281"> reputation of Athens; and they a&s;&s;erted with &s;o
much vehemence, that it would be entirely de&s;troyed &s;hould they &s;hun the
battle as the Syracu&s;ans offered it them, that they at la&s;t forced Nicias
to a compliance. The Athe|nians had &s;eventy-five gallies, and the
Syracu|&s;ans eighty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day the fleets continued in &s;ight of each other, in
the great harbour, without en|gaging, and only a few &s;kirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed,
af|ter which both parties retired; while the land-forces acted in the &s;ame
manner. The Syracu|&s;ans did not make the lea&s;t motion the &s;econd day.
Nicias, taking advantage of this inactivity, cau&s;ed the tran&s;ports to draw
up in a line at &s;ome di&s;tance from one another, in order that his gallies
might retire behind them with &s;afe|ty, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be defeated. On
the mor|row the Syracu&s;ans came up &s;ooner than u&s;ual, when a great part
of the day was &s;pent in &s;kir|mi&s;hing, after which they retired. The
Athe|nians did not &s;uppo&s;e they would return, but imagined that fear would
make them fly. But having refre&s;hed them&s;elves in great diligence, and
returning on board their gallies, they at|tacked the Athenians, who were far
from ex|pecting them. The latter being now forced to return immediately on
board their &s;hips, <PB N="279" REF="282"> they entered them in great
di&s;order; &s;o that they had not time to draw them up in a line of battle,
and mo&s;t of the &s;ailors were fa&s;ting. Victory did not long continue in
&s;u&s;pence. The Athenians, after making a &s;hort and &s;light
re|&s;i&s;tance, retired behind their line of tran&s;|ports. The enemy
pur&s;ued them thither, but were &s;topped by the yards of tho&s;e &s;hips to
which were fixed dolphins of lead: the&s;e being very heavy, had they fallen on
the enemy's gallies, would have &s;unk them at once. The Athenians lo&s;t
&s;even gallies in this engagement, and a great number of &s;oldiers were
either kill|ed or taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This lo&s;s threw Nicias into the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation: all the
misfortunes he had met with ever &s;ince the time he had enjoyed the &s;upreme
command, came into his mind, and he was now involved in a greater than any of
them, by his complying with the advice of his colleagues. Whil&s;t he was
revolving the&s;e gloomy ideas, Demo&s;thenes's fleet was &s;een coming forward
in great pomp, and with &s;uch an air as might fill the enemy with dread. It
was now the day after the battle. This fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy-three
gallies, on board of which were five thou&s;and fighting men, and about three
thou&s;and archers, &s;lingers, and <PB N="280" REF="283"> bowmen. All the&s;e
gallies were richly trim|med, their prows being adorned with &s;hining
&s;treamers, manned with &s;tout rowers, com|manded by good officers, and
echoing with the &s;ound of clarions and trumpets, Demo&s;t|henes having
affected an air of pomp and tri|umph purpo&s;ely to &s;trike terror into the
enemy.</P>
<P>This gallant &s;ight alarmed them indeed be|yond expre&s;&s;ion.
They did not &s;ee any end, or even the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their
calamities. All they had hitherto done or &s;uffered was as nothing, and their
work was to begin again. What hopes could they entertain of being able to weary
out the patience of the Athenians, &s;ince, though they had a camp in|trenched
in the middle of Attica, were how|ever able to &s;end a &s;econd army into
Sicily as con&s;iderable as the former, and that their power, as well as their
courage, &s;eemed, not|with&s;tanding all their lo&s;&s;es, in&s;tead of
dimini&s;h|ing, to increa&s;e daily.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes having made an exact enquiry into the &s;tate of
things, imagined it would not be proper for him to lo&s;e time as Nicias had
done, who having &s;pread an univer&s;al terror at his fir&s;t arrival,
becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> afterwards the object of
contempt for his having wintered in Catana, <PB N="281" REF="284"> in&s;tead of
going directly to Syracu&s;e, and had afterwards given Gylippus an opportunity
of throwing troops into it. He flattered him&s;elf with the hopes that he
&s;hould be able to carry the city at the fir&s;t attack, by taking advan|tage
of the alarm which the news of his arrival would &s;pread in every part of it,
and by that means &s;hould immediately put an end to the war; otherwi&s;e he
intended to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and no longer harra&s;s and le&s;&s;en the
troops by fighting battles never deci&s;ive, nor quite ex|hau&s;t the city of
Athens, by employing its trea|&s;ures in needle&s;s expences.</P>
<P>Nicias, terrified by this bold and precipitate re&s;olution of
Demo&s;thenes, conjured him not to be &s;o ha&s;ty, but to take time to weigh
things deliberately, that he might have no cau&s;e to repent of what he
&s;hould do. He ob&s;erved to him, that the enemy would be ruined by de|lays;
that their provi&s;ions as well as money were entirely exhau&s;ted; that their
allies were going to abandon them; that they mu&s;t &s;oon be reduced to &s;uch
extremity for want of pro|vi&s;ions, as would force them to &s;urrender, as
they had before re&s;olved. For there were cer|tain per&s;ons in Syracu&s;e who
held a &s;ecret cor|re&s;pondence with Nicias, and exhorted him not to be
impatient, becau&s;e the Syracu&s;ans <PB N="282" REF="285"> were tired with
the war and with Gylippus; and that &s;hould the nece&s;&s;ity to which they
were reduced be ever &s;o little increa&s;ed, they would &s;urrender at
di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>As Nicias did not explain him&s;elf clearly, and would not declare
in expre&s;s terms that &s;ure and certain advices were &s;ent him of what|ever
was tran&s;acted in the city, his remon|&s;trances were con&s;idered as an
effect of the ti|midity and &s;lowne&s;s with which he had always been
reproached. Such, &s;aid they, are his u&s;ual protractions, delays,
di&s;tru&s;ts, and fearful precaution, whereby he has deadened all the
vivacity, and extingui&s;hed all the ardour of the troops, in not marching them
immediately again&s;t the enemy; but, on the contrary, by deferring to attack
them till his own forces were weakened and de&s;pi&s;ed. This made the re&s;t
of the generals, and all the officers, come over to Demo&s;thenes's opinion,
and Nicias him&s;elf was at la&s;t forced to acquie&s;ce in it.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes, after having attacked to no purpo&s;e the wall which
cut the contravallation of the be&s;iegers, confined him&s;elf to the attack of
Epipolae, from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;hould he once be ma&s;ter of it, the
wall would be quite undefended. He, therefore, took pro|vi&s;ions 
<PB N="283" REF="286"> for five days, with workmen, imple|ments, and every
thing nece&s;&s;ary for him to defend that po&s;t after he &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it. As there was no going up to it in the day-time
undi&s;covered, he marched thither in the night with all his forces, followed
by Eury|medon and Menander; Nicias &s;taying behind to guard the camp. They
went up by the way of Euryelus, as before, unperceived by the centinels,
attacked the fir&s;t intrenchment, and &s;tormed it, after killing part of
tho&s;e who de|fended it. Demo&s;thenes, not &s;atisfied with this advantage,
to prevent the ardour of his &s;oldiers from cooling, and not delay the
execution of his de&s;ign, marches forward. During this in|terval, the forces
of the city, &s;u&s;tained by Gy|lippus, marched under arms out of the
in|trenchments. Being &s;eized with a&s;toni&s;hment, which the darkne&s;s of
the night increa&s;ed, they were immediately repul&s;ed and put to flight. But,
as the Athenians advanced in di&s;order, to force whatever might re&s;i&s;t
their arms, le&s;t the enemy might rally again, &s;hould time be allowed them
to breathe and recover from their &s;urprize, they are &s;topped on a &s;ud|den
by the Boeotians, who make a vigorous &s;tand, and marching again&s;t the
Athenians with their pikes pre&s;ented, they repul&s;e them 
<PB N="284" REF="287"> with great &s;houts, and make a dreadful &s;laugh|ter.
This &s;preads an univer&s;al terror through the re&s;t of the army. Tho&s;e
who fled, either force along &s;uch as were advancing to their
a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e mi&s;taking them for enemies, turn their arms
again&s;t them. They now were all mixed indi&s;criminately, it being
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover objects in the horrors of a night, which was not
&s;o gloomy as entirely to make objects imperceptible, nor yet light enough to
di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which were &s;een. The Athe|nians &s;ought for one
another to no purpo&s;e, and from their often a&s;king the word, by which only
they were able to know one an|other, a &s;trange confu&s;ion of &s;ounds was
heard, which occa&s;ion no little di&s;order, not to men|tion that they by this
means divulged the word to the enemy, and could not learn theirs; be|cau&s;e,
by their being together, and in a body, they had no occa&s;ion to repeat it. In
the mean time, tho&s;e who were pur&s;ued threw them&s;elves from the top of
the rocks, and many were da&s;hed to pieces by the fall; and as mo&s;t of
tho&s;e who e&s;caped &s;traggled from one another up and down the fields and
woods, they were cut to pieces the next day by the enemy's hor&s;e who
pur&s;ued them. Two thou|&s;and Athenians were &s;lain in this engagement, 
<PB N="285" REF="288"> and a great number of arms were taken, tho&s;e who fled
having thrown them away, that they might be the better able to e&s;cape over
the precipices. Soon after Gylippus having made the tour of Sicily, brought a
great number of troops with him, which rendered the affairs of Athens &s;till
more de&s;perate, and deprived Nicias of all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; be&s;ides,
the Athenian army now began to dimini&s;h exceed|ingly by &s;ickne&s;s, and
nothing &s;een to remain but their quitting an i&s;land in which they had
experienced every mortification. Nicias no longer oppo&s;ed the re&s;olution,
and only de&s;ired to have it kept &s;ecret. Orders were, there|fore, given as
privately as po&s;&s;ible, for the fleet to prepare for &s;etting &s;ail with
the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>When all things were ready, the moment they were going to &s;et
&s;ail, (wholly un&s;u&s;pect|ed by the enemy, who were far from &s;urmi&s;ing
they would leave Sicily &s;o &s;oon) the moon was &s;uddenly eclip&s;ed in the
middle of the night, and lo&s;t all its &s;plendour, which terrified Ni|cias
and the whole army, who from ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, were
a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o &s;udden a change, the cau&s;es of which they did not
know, and therefore dreaded the con&s;equences of it. They then con&s;ulted the
&s;ooth&s;ayers, <PB N="286" REF="289"> who being equally unacquainted with the
rea|&s;ons of this phaemonenon, only augmented their con&s;ternation. It was
the cu&s;tom, after &s;uch accidents had happened, to &s;u&s;pend their
enterprize but for three days. The &s;ooth&s;ayers pronounced, that he mu&s;t
not &s;et &s;ail till three times nine days were pa&s;t, (the&s;e were
Thucy|dides' words) which doubtle&s;s was a my&s;terious number in the opinion
of the people. Nicias, &s;crupulous to a fault, and full of a mi&s;taken
veneration for the&s;e blind interpreters of the will of the gods, declared
that he would wait a whole revolution of the moon, and not re|turn till the
&s;ame day of the next month, as if he had not &s;een the planet very clearly,
the in&s;tant it had emerged from that part which was darkened by the
interpo&s;ition of the earth's body.</P>
<P>But he was not allowed time for this. The news of the intended
departure of the Atheni|ans &s;oon &s;pread over the city; a re&s;olution was
taken to attack the be&s;iegers both by &s;ea and land. The Syracu&s;ans began
the fir&s;t day by attacking the intrenchments, and gained a &s;light advantage
over the enemy. On the mor|row they made a &s;econd attack, and, at the &s;ame
time, &s;ailed with &s;eventy-&s;ix gallies again&s;t eighty-&s;ix of the
Athenian. Eumyredon, who <PB N="287" REF="290"> commanded the right of the
Athenian fleet, hav|ing &s;pread along the &s;hore to &s;urround them, this
movement proved fatal to him; for, as he was detached from the body of the
fleet, the Syracu&s;ans, after forcing the main battle, which was in the
center, attacked him, drove him vi|gorou&s;ly into the gulf called Da&s;con,
and there defeated him entirely. Eumyredon lo&s;t his life in the engagement.
They afterwards gave chace to the re&s;t of the gallies, and run them again&s;t
the &s;hore. Gylippus, who com|manded the land army, &s;eeing the Athenian
gallies were forced a-ground, and not able to return into the &s;taccado,
landed with part of his troops, in order to charge the &s;oldiers, in ca&s;e
they &s;hould be forced to run a&s;hore, and give his friends the more room to
tow &s;uch gallies as they &s;hould have taken; however, he was repul&s;ed by
the Tyrrhenians, who were po&s;ted on that &s;ide, and obliged by the
Athe|nians, who flew to &s;u&s;tain them, to retire with &s;ome lo&s;s as far
as a moor which lay near it. The latter &s;aved mo&s;t of their &s;hips,
eighteen excepted, which were taken by the Syracu&s;ans, and their crews cut to
pieces by them. After this, re&s;olving to burn the re&s;t, they filled an old
ve&s;&s;el with combu&s;tible materials, and hav|ing &s;et fire to it, they
drove it by the help of <PB N="288" REF="291"> the wind again&s;t the
Athenians, who neverthe|le&s;s extingui&s;hed the fire, and drove off that
&s;hip; each &s;ide erected trophies, the Syracu|&s;ans for the death of
Eurymedon, and the ad|vantage they had gained the day before, and the Athenians
for their having driven part of the enemy into the moor, and put the other part
to flight. But the minds of the two na|tions were very differently
di&s;po&s;ed; the Syra|cu&s;ans, who had been thrown into the utmo&s;t
con&s;ternation at the arrival of Demo&s;thenes with his fleet, &s;eeing
them&s;elves victorious in a naval engagement, re&s;umed fre&s;h hope, and
a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves of a complete victory over their enemies. The
Athenians, on the con|trary, fru&s;trated of their only re&s;ource, and
overcome at &s;ea, &s;o contrary to their expecta|tions, entirely lo&s;t
courage, and had no thoughts but of retiring.</P>
<P>The enemy, to deprive them of all re&s;ource, and prevent their
e&s;caping, &s;hut the mouth of the great harbour, which was about five
hun|dred paces wide, with gallies placed cro&s;s-wi&s;e, and other ve&s;&s;els
fixed with anchors and iron chains, and, at the &s;ame time, made the
requi|&s;ite preparations for a battle, in ca&s;e they &s;hould have courage to
engage again. When the Athenians &s;aw them&s;elves thus hemmed in, 
<PB N="289" REF="292"> the generals and principal officers a&s;&s;embled, in
order to deliberate on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs. They were in
ab&s;olute want of provi&s;ions, which was owing to their having forbid the
people of Catana to bring any, from the hopes they en|tertained of their being
able to retire, and they could not procure any from other places unle&s;s they
were ma&s;ters of the &s;ea; this made them re&s;olve to venture a &s;ea fight.
In this view they were determined to leave their old camp and their walls, and
to entrench them&s;elves on the &s;hore near their &s;hips, in the &s;malle&s;t
compa&s;s po&s;&s;ible; their de&s;ign was to leave &s;ome forces in that place
to guard their baggage and the &s;ick, and to fight with the re&s;t aboard all
the &s;hips they &s;hould have &s;aved. They intended to retire into Catana in
ca&s;e they &s;hould be victorious, otherwi&s;e to &s;et fire to their &s;hips,
and to march by land to the neare&s;t city be|longing to their allies.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution being taken, Nicias imme|diately filled an hundred
and ten gallies (the others having lo&s;t their oars) with the flower of his
infantry, and drew up the re&s;t of the forces, particularly the bowmen, in
order of battle on the &s;hore. As the Athenians dread|ed very much the beaks
of the Syracu&s;an gal|lies, Nicias had provided harping-irons to 
<PB N="290" REF="293"> grapple them, in order to break the force of the blow,
and to come immediately to clo&s;e fight as on &s;hore. But the enemy
perceiving this, covered the prows and upper part of their gallies with
leather, to prevent their being &s;o ea&s;ily laid hold of. The commanders on
both &s;ides had employed all their rhetoric to animate their men, and none
could ever have been prompted with &s;tronger motives, for the battle which was
going to be fought was to deter|mine not only their lives and liberties, but
al&s;o the fate of their country.</P>
<P>This battle was very ob&s;tinate and bloody. The Athenians being
arrived at the mouth of the port, ea&s;ily took tho&s;e &s;hips which defend|ed
the entrance of it, but when they attempted to break the chain of the re&s;t to
widen the pa&s;&s;age, the enemy came up from all quarters. As near two hundred
gallies came ru&s;hing on each &s;ide in a narrow place, there mu&s;t
nece&s;|&s;arily be a very great confu&s;ion, and the ve&s;&s;els could not
ea&s;ily advance forward, or retire, or turn about to renew the attack. The
beaks of the gallies for this rea&s;on did very little execu|tion, but there
were very furious and frequent di&s;charges. The Athenians were overwhelm|ed
with a &s;hower of &s;tones, which always did execution from what place
&s;oever they were <PB N="291" REF="294"> thrown, whereas they defended
them&s;elves by only &s;hooting darts and arrows, which by the motion of the
&s;hips, from the agitation of the &s;ea, did not carry true, and by that means
the greate&s;t part of them did little execution. Ari&s;|ton, the pilot, had
given the Syracu&s;ans this coun&s;el. The&s;e di&s;charges being over, the
&s;oldiers heavily armed attempted to enter the enemies &s;hips, in order to
fight hand to hand, and it often happened that whil&s;t they were climbing up
one &s;ide, their own &s;hips were en|tered on the other, and two or three
&s;hips were grappled to one, which occa&s;ioned a great perplexity and
confu&s;ion. Farther, the noi&s;e of the &s;hips that da&s;hed one again&s;t
the other, the different cries of the victors and vanqui&s;hed, prevented the
orders of the offi|cers from being heard. The Athenians want|ed to force a
pa&s;&s;age, whatever might be the con&s;equence, to &s;ecure their return into
their own country, and this the enemy employed their utmo&s;t efforts to
prevent, in order that they might gain a more complete and more glorious
victory. The two land-armies, which were drawn up on the highe&s;t part of the
&s;hore, and the inhabitants of the city who were there,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">an to the walls, whil&s;t the
re&s;t kneeling in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he temples were
imploring heaven to give <PB N="292" REF="295"> &s;ucce&s;s to their
fellow-citizens, all the&s;e &s;aw clear, becau&s;e of their little di&s;tance
from the fleets every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, and contemplated the battle as
from an amphitheatre, but not with|out great anxiety and terror. Attentive to,
and &s;huddering at every movement, and the &s;e|veral changes which happened,
they di&s;covered the concern they had in the battle, their fears, their hopes,
their grief, their joy, by different cries and different ge&s;tures,
&s;tretching out their hands &s;ometimes towards the combatants to animate
them, at other times towards hea|ven, to implore the &s;uccour and protection
of the gods. At la&s;t the Athenian fleet, after &s;u&s;taining a long battle,
and a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance, was put to flight, and drove again&s;t the
&s;hore. The Syracu&s;ans, who were &s;pecta|tors of this victory, conveyed the
news to the whole city by an univer&s;al &s;hout. The victors, now ma&s;ters of
the &s;ea, and &s;ailing with a favourable wind towards Syracu&s;e, erected a
trophy, whil&s;t the Athenians, who were quite dejected and overpowered, did
not &s;o much as reque&s;t that their dead &s;oldiers might be de|livered to
them, in order to pay the la&s;t &s;ad duty to their remains.</P>
<P>There now remained but two methods for them to chu&s;e, either to
attempt the pa&s;&s;age <PB N="293" REF="296"> a &s;econd time, for which they
had &s;hips and &s;oldiers &s;ufficient, or to abandon their fleet to the enemy
and retire by land. Demo&s;thenes propo&s;ed the former, but the &s;ailors, in
the deepe&s;t affliction, refu&s;ed to obey, fully per|&s;uaded that it would
be impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;u&s;tain a &s;econd engagement. The &s;econd
me|thod was, therefore, re&s;olved upon, and ac|cordingly they prepared to
&s;et out in the night, to conceal the march of their army from the enemy.</P>
<P>But Hermocrates, who &s;u&s;pected their de|&s;ign, was very
&s;en&s;ible that it was of the ut|mo&s;t importance not to &s;uffer &s;o great
a body of forces to e&s;cape, &s;ince they otherwi&s;e might &s;ortify
them&s;elves in &s;ome corner of the i&s;land, and renew the war. The
Syracu&s;ans were at that time in the mid&s;t of their fe&s;tivity and
re|joicings, and meditating nothing but how they might divert them&s;elves
after the toils they had &s;u&s;tained in fight. They were then &s;olem|nizing
the fe&s;tival of Hercules. To de&s;ire the Syracu&s;ans to take up arms again
in order to pur&s;ue the enemy, and to attempt to draw them from their
diver&s;ions, either by force or per&s;ua&s;ion, would have been to no
purpo&s;e, for which rea&s;on, another expedient was employ|ed. Hermocrates
&s;ent out a few hor&s;emen, <PB N="294" REF="297"> who were to pa&s;s for
friends of the Athenians, and ordered them to cry aloud, Tell Nicias not to
retire till day light, for the Syracu&s;ans lye in ambu&s;h for him, and have
&s;eized on their pa&s;&s;es. This fal&s;e advice &s;topped Nicias at once, and
he did not even &s;et out the next day, in order that the &s;oldiers might have
more time to prepare for their departure, and carry off whatever might be
nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and abandon the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The enemy had time enough for &s;eizing the avenues. The next
morning early they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the mo&s;t difficult
pa&s;&s;es, fortified tho&s;e places where the rivers were fordable, broke down
the bridges, and &s;pread detachments of hor&s;e up and down the plain, &s;o
that there was not one place which the Athenians could pa&s;s without fighting.
They &s;et out upon their march the third day after the battle, with de&s;ign
to retire to Catana. The whole army was in an inexpre&s;&s;ible
con|&s;ternation, to &s;ee &s;uch a great number of men either dead, or dying,
&s;ome of whom were left expo&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts, and the re&s;t to the
cruelty of the enemy. Tho&s;e who were &s;ick and wounded conjured them with
tears, to take them along with the army, and held by their cloaths when they
were going, or el&s;e crawl|ing <PB N="295" REF="298"> after them, followed
them as far as their &s;trength would permit; and, when this failed, had
recour&s;e to tears, &s;ighs, im|precations, and &s;ending up toward heaven
plaintive and dying groans; they called upon the gods, as well as men, to
avenge their cruelty, whil&s;t every place echoed with la|mentations.</P>
<P>The whole army was in a deplorable condi|tion. All the Athenians
were &s;eized with the deepe&s;t melancholy. They were inwardly tortur|ed with
rage and angui&s;h, when they repre&s;ented to them&s;elves the greatne&s;s
from which they were fallen, the extreme mi&s;ery to which they were reduced,
and the &s;till greater evils from which they fore&s;aw it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape. They could not bear the compari&s;on for
ever pre&s;ent in their thoughts, of the triumphant &s;tate in which they had
left Athens, in the mid&s;t of the good wi&s;hes and acclamations of the
people, with the ignominy of their retreat, aggravated by the cries and
imprecations of their relations and fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t melancholy part of the &s;pecta|cle, and that which
mo&s;t de&s;erved compa&s;&s;ion, was Nicias, dejected and worn out by a
tedious illne&s;s, deprived of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores 
<PB N="296" REF="299"> at a time when his age and infirmities required them
mo&s;t, pierced not only with his private grief, but with that of others, all
which preyed upon his heart. However, this great man, &s;upe|rior to all his
evils, thought of nothing but how he might be&s;t comfort his &s;oldiers, and
revive their courage. He ran up and down in all places, crying aloud, that
their &s;ituation was not yet de&s;perate, and that other armies had e&s;cap|ed
from greater dangers; that they ought not to accu&s;e them&s;elves, or grieve
too immode|rately for misfortunes which they had not oc|ca&s;ioned; that if
they had offended &s;ome god, his vengeance mu&s;t be &s;atiated by this time;
that fortune, after having &s;o long favoured the enemy, would at la&s;t be
tired of per&s;ecuting them; that their bravery and their numbers made them
&s;till formidable, (being &s;till near forty thou&s;and &s;trong) that no city
in Sicily would be able to with&s;tand them, nor prevent their &s;ettling
wherever they might think pro|per; that they had no more to do but to take care
&s;everally of them&s;elves, and march in good order; that by a prudent and
courageous retreat, which was now become their only re|&s;ource, they would not
only &s;ave them&s;elves, but al&s;o their country, and enable it to recover
its former grandeur.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="300"> The army marched in two bodies, both drawn up
in the form of a phalanx, the fir&s;t being commanded by Nicias, and the
&s;econd by Demo&s;thenes, with the baggage in the cen|ter. Being come to the
river Anapis, they forced their pa&s;&s;age, and afterwards were charg|ed by
all the enemy's cavalry, as well as archers, who di&s;charged perpetually upon
them. They were annoyed in this manner during &s;everal days march, every one
of the pa&s;&s;es being guarded, and the Athenians being obliged to di&s;pute
every inch of their way. The enemy did not care to hazard a battle again&s;t an
army which de&s;pair alone might render invincible; and the in&s;tant the
Athenians pre&s;ented the Syracu&s;ans battle, the latter retired; but
when|ever the former proceeded in their march, they advanced and charged them
in their re|treat.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes and Nicias &s;eeing the mi&s;erable condition to which
the troops were reduced, being in extreme want of provi&s;ions, and great
numbers of them wounded, judged it advi&s;e|able to retire towards the &s;ea by
a quite con|trary way from that in which they then march|ed, and to make
directly for Camarina and Gela, in&s;tead of proceeding to Catana as they
fir&s;t intended. They &s;et out in the night after <PB N="298" REF="301">
lighting a great number of fires. The retreat was made in great confu&s;ion and
di&s;order, as generally happens to great armies in the gloomy horrors of the
night, e&s;pecially when the ene|my is not far off. However, the van-guard
commanded by Nicias, went forward in good order, but above half the rear-guard,
with Demo&s;thenes at their head, quitted from the main body, and lo&s;t their
way. On the next day the Syracu&s;ans, who on the report of their retreat, had
marched with the utmo&s;t dili|gence, came up with him about noon, and having
&s;urrounded him with their hor&s;e, drove him into a narrow place inclo&s;ed
with a wall, where his &s;oldiers fought like lions. Perceiving at the clo&s;e
of the day that they were oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, and covered with wounds,
the con|quering Syracu&s;ans gave the i&s;landers leave to retire, which &s;ome
of them accepted, and they afterwards &s;pared the lives of the re&s;t who
&s;ur|rendered at di&s;cretion, with Demo&s;thenes, after having &s;tipulated
that they &s;hould not be put to death, nor &s;entenced to perpetual
impri&s;on|ment. About &s;ix thou&s;and &s;oldiers &s;urrender|ed on the&s;e
conditions.</P>
<P>Nicias arrived the &s;ame evening at the river Erineus, and
pa&s;&s;ing it, encamped on a moun|tain, where the enemy came up with him the 
<PB N="299" REF="302"> next day, and &s;ummoned him to &s;urrender at
di&s;|cretion as Demo&s;thenes had done. Nicias could not per&s;uade him&s;elf
at fir&s;t that what they told him concerning Demo&s;thenes was true; and,
therefore, de&s;ired leave to &s;end &s;ome hor&s;e for information. Upon their
returning with the news that Demo&s;thenes had really &s;urrendered in that
manner, Nicias offered to pay the ex|pences of the war, upon condition they
would permit him to leave the country with his forces, and to give as many
Athenians for ho&s;tages as they &s;hould be obliged to pay ta|lents. But the
enemy rejected this propo&s;al with di&s;dain and in&s;olence, and renewed the
attack. Nicias, though in ab&s;olute want of all things, however &s;u&s;tained
the charge the whole night, and marched towards the river A&s;inarus. When they
were got to the banks of it, the Syracu&s;ans advancing up to them, threw
mo&s;t of them into the &s;tream, the re&s;t already having plunged voluntarily
into it to quench their thir&s;t. Here the greate&s;t and mo&s;t bloody havock
was made, the poor wretches being butchered without the lea&s;t pity as they
were drinking. Nicias finding all lo&s;t, and unable to bear this di&s;mal
&s;pectacle, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion, upon condition that Gylippus
&s;hould di&s;continue the fight, and <PB N="300" REF="303"> &s;pare the re&s;t
of his army. A great number were killed, and more taken pri&s;oners, &s;o that
all Sicily was filled with them. The Atheni|ans &s;eemed to have been
di&s;plea&s;ed with their general for &s;urrendering in this manner at
di&s;|cretion; and, for this rea&s;on, his name was omitted in a public
monument, on which was engraved the names of tho&s;e commanders who had lo&s;t
their lives in fighting for their country.</P>
<P>The victors, adorned with the arms taken from the pri&s;oners, the
fine&s;t and large&s;t trees they could find on the banks of the rivers, and
made a kind of trophies of tho&s;e trees, when crowning them&s;elves with
chaplets of flowers, dre&s;&s;ing their hor&s;es in the riche&s;t capari&s;ons,
and cropping tho&s;e of their enemies, they en|tered triumphantly into
Syracu&s;e, after having happily terminated the mo&s;t con&s;iderable war in
which they had ever been engaged with the Greeks, and won by their &s;trength
and valour a mo&s;t &s;ignal and mo&s;t complete victory.</P>
<P>The next day a council was held to delibe|rate on what was to be
done with the pri&s;oners. Diocles, one of the leaders of greate&s;t authority
among the people, propo&s;ed that all the Athe|nians who were born of free
parents, and all &s;uch Sicilians as had joined with them, &s;hould be
impri&s;oned, and only two mea&s;ures of flour <PB N="301" REF="304"> and one
of water given them daily; that the &s;laves and all the allies &s;hould be
publicly &s;old, and that the two Athenian generals &s;hould be fir&s;t
&s;courged with rods, and afterwards put to death.</P>
<P>This la&s;t article was exceedingly di&s;liked by all wi&s;e and
compa&s;&s;ionate Syracu&s;ans. Her|mocrates, who was very famous for his
probi|ty and ju&s;tice, attempted to make &s;ome remon|&s;trances to the
people, but they would not hear him, and the &s;houts which echoed on all
&s;ides prevented him from continuing his &s;peech. At that in&s;tant an
ancient man, vene|rable for his great age and gravity, who in this war had
lo&s;t two &s;ons, the only heirs to his name and e&s;tate, made his &s;ervants
carry him to the tribunal for harrangues, and the in&s;tant he appeared a
profound &s;ilence was made. 
<Q REND="inline">"You here behold, &s;ays he, an un|fortunate father
who has felt more than any other Syracu&s;an the fatal effects of this war, by
the death of two &s;ons who formed all the con|&s;olation, and were the only
&s;upports of my old age. I cannot, indeed, forbear admiring their courage and
felicity, in &s;acrificing to their country's welfare a life of which they
would one day have been deprived by the common cour&s;e of nature: but then I
cannot but be <PB N="302" REF="305"> &s;trongly affected with the cruel wound
which their death has made in my heart, nor forbear hating and dete&s;ting the
Athenians, the au|thors of this unhappy war, as the murtherers of my children;
but, however, I cannot con|ceal one circum&s;tance, which is, that I am le&s;s
&s;en&s;ible of my private affliction than of the ho|nour of my country, and I
&s;ee it expo&s;ed to eternal infamy by the barbarous advice which is now given
you. The Athenians indeed me|rit the wor&s;t treatment, and every kind of
puni&s;hment that can be inflicted on them for &s;o unju&s;tly declaring war
again&s;t us, but have not the gods, the ju&s;t avengers of crimes, puni&s;hed
them, and revenged us &s;ufficiently. When their general laid down his arms and
&s;urrendered, did he not do this in the hopes of having their lives &s;pared,
and if we put them to death, will it be po&s;&s;ible for us to avoid the ju&s;t
reproach of our having violated the laws of nations, and di&s;honoured our
vic|tory by an unheard-of cruelty? How will you &s;uffer your glory to be thus
&s;ullied in the face of the whole world, and have it &s;aid, that a nation who
fir&s;t dedicated a temple in this city to Clemency had not found any in yours?
Surely victories and triumphs do not give im|mortal glory to a city; but the
exerci&s;ing <PB N="303" REF="306"> mercy towards a vanqui&s;hed enemy, the
u&s;ing moderation in the greate&s;t pro&s;perity, and fear|ing to offend the
gods by a haughty and in&s;olent pride, will ever in&s;ure it. You doubtle&s;s
have not forgot that this Nicias, who&s;e fate you are going to pronounce, was
the very man who pleaded your cau&s;e in the a&s;&s;embly of the Athenians, and
employed all his credit, and the whole power of his eloquence to di&s;&s;uade
his country from embarking in this war; &s;hould you, therefore, pronounce
&s;entence of death on this worthy general, would it be a ju&s;t reward for the
zeal he &s;howed for your intere&s;t? With regard to my&s;elf, death would be
le&s;s grievous to me than the &s;ight of &s;o horrid an inju&s;tice committed
by my countrymen and fellow-citizens."</Q></P>
<P>The people &s;eemed moved with compa&s;&s;ion at this &s;peech,
e&s;pecially when this venerable old man fir&s;t a&s;cended, they expected to
hear him cry aloud for vengeance on tho&s;e who had brought all his calamities
upon him, in&s;tead of &s;uing for their pardon. But the enemies of the
Athenians having expatiated with vehe|mence on the unheard of cruelties which
their republic had exerci&s;ed on &s;everal cities belong|ing to their enemies,
and even to their ancient allies; the inveteracy which the commanders had
&s;hewn again&s;t Syracu&s;e, and the evils they <PB N="304" REF="307"> would
have made it &s;uffer had they been vic|torious, the afflictions and groans of
infinite numbers of Syracu&s;ans who bewailed the death of their children and
near relations, who&s;e manes could be appea&s;ed no other way than by the
blood of their murderers. The&s;e repre&s;enta|tions prevailed, and the people
returned to their &s;anguinary re&s;olution, and followed Diocles's advice in
every re&s;pect. Gylippus u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours, but in vain, to have
Nicias and Demo&s;thenes given up to him, (e&s;pecially as he had taken them)
in order for him to carry them to Lacedaemon; but his demand was re|jected with
a haughty &s;corn, and the two ge|nerals were put to death.</P>
<P>All wi&s;e and compa&s;&s;ionate men could not forbear &s;hedding
tears at the tragical fate of two &s;uch illu&s;trious per&s;onages, and
particular|ly for Nicias, who, of all men of his time, &s;eemed lea&s;t to
merit &s;o ignominious and un|timely an end. When people recollect the
&s;peeches and remon&s;trances he had made to prevent this war; and, on the
other &s;ide, when they con&s;idered how high a regard he had al|ways retained
for things relating to religion, the greate&s;t part of them were tempted to
ex|claim again&s;t providence, in &s;eeing that a man, who had ever &s;hown the
highe&s;t reverence for <PB N="305" REF="308"> the gods, and had always exerted
him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t for their honour and wor&s;hip, &s;hould be &s;o ill
rewarded by them, and meet with no better fate than the mo&s;t abandoned
wretches.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners were &s;hut up in the pri|&s;ons of Syracu&s;e,
where, crouded one upon the other, they &s;uffered incredible torment for eight
months. Here they were for ever ex|po&s;ed to the inclemencies of the weather,
&s;corched in the day-time by the burning rays of the &s;un, or frozen in the
night by the colds of autumn; poi&s;oned by the &s;tench of their own
excrement, by the carca&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who died of their wounds and of
&s;ickne&s;s, and worn out by hunger and thir&s;t, for the daily allowance to
each was but a &s;mall mea&s;ure of water and two of meal. Tho&s;e who were
taken out of this place two months after, in order to be &s;old as &s;laves,
many of whom were citizens who had concealed their condition, found a le&s;s
rigorous fate. Their wi&s;dom, their patience, and a certain air of probity and
mode&s;ty were of great advantage to them, for they were &s;oon re&s;tored to
their liberty, or met with the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t generous treat|ment from
their ma&s;ters. Several of them even owed the good u&s;age they met with to 
<PB N="306" REF="309"> Eurypides, the fine&s;t &s;cenes of who&s;e tragedies
they repeated to the Sicilians, who were ex|tremely fond of them; &s;o that
when they re|turned to their own country, they went and &s;a|luted that poet as
their deliverer, and inform|ed him of the admirable effects wrought in their
favour by his ver&s;es.</P>
<P>The news of the defeat being carried to Athens, the citizens would
not believe it at fir&s;t, and were &s;o far from giving credit to the report,
that they &s;entenced that man to death who fir&s;t publi&s;hed the tidings;
but when it was confirm|ed, all the Athenians were &s;eized with the utmo&s;t
con&s;ternation; and, as if them&s;elves had not decreed the war, they vented
their rage and re|&s;entment again&s;t the orators who had pro|moted the
enterprize, as well as again&s;t the &s;ooth&s;ayers, who by their &s;uppo&s;ed
prodigies, had flattered them with the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. They had never
been reduced to &s;o deplorable a condition as now, having neither hor&s;e,
foot, money, gallies, nor mariners; in a word, they were in the deepe&s;t
de&s;pair, expecting every moment that the enemy, elate with &s;o great a
victory, and &s;trengthened by the revolt of the allies, would come and invade
Athens both by &s;ea and land with all the forces of Pe|loponne&s;us. 
<PB N="307" REF="310"> Cicero had rea&s;on to ob&s;erve, &s;peaking of the
battles in the harbour of Syra|cu&s;e, that it was there the troops of Athens,
as well as their gallies, were ruined and &s;unk, and that in this harbour the
power and glory of the Athenians were mi&s;erably &s;hipwrecked.</P>
<P>The Athenians, however, did not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be wholly
dejected, but re&s;um|ed courage. They now re&s;olved to rai&s;e money on all
&s;ides, and to import timber for building &s;hips, in order to awe the allies,
and parti|cularly the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Euboea. They retrenched
all &s;uperfluous expences, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a new council of ancient men
who were to weigh and examine all affairs before they &s;hould be propo&s;ed to
the people. In fine, they omitted nothing which might be of &s;ervice in the
pre&s;ent conjuncture, the alarm in which they were in, and their common
dan|ger, obliging every individual to be attentive to the nece&s;&s;ities of
the &s;tate, and &s;edulous to all advice that might promote its
intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Such was the event of the &s;iege of Syracu&s;e, the failure of
which de&s;troyed the power of tho&s;e that had undertaken it. We have
hither|to &s;een Athens ri&s;ing in arts and arms, giving le&s;&s;ons both in
politene&s;s, humanity, philo|&s;ophy, <PB N="306" REF="311">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="307" REF="312">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="308" REF="313"> and war,
to all the nations round, and beginning to fix an empire, which, if once
e&s;tabli&s;hed, no neighbouring power could over|throw. But their ambition
grew fa&s;ter than their abilities, and their views extending be|yond their
capacity to execute, they fell at once from that height to which for ages they
had been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly a&s;piring. We are now, therefore, to be pre&s;ented
with a different picture, we are no longer to view this little &s;tate panting
for conque&s;ts over other nations, but timorou&s;ly defending it&s;elf at
home; we are no longer to view Athens taking the lead in the councils, and
conducting the confe|derated armies of Greece; they now become in a mea&s;ure
annihilated, they fade from the eye of the hi&s;torian; and other nations,
who&s;e names have hitherto been &s;carcely mentioned, emerge from ob&s;curity.
The ra&s;hne&s;s of this enterprize was &s;everely puni&s;hed in the lo&s;s of
their be&s;t generals, fleets, and armies; all now was de&s;troyed, or left at
the mercy of tho&s;e whom they had &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably undertaken to
&s;ubdue.</P>
<P>Their allies began now to think of throw|ing off their yoke; and
even tho&s;e who had &s;tood neuter took this occa&s;ion to declare 
<PB N="309" REF="314"> again&s;t them. But the Lacedaemonians being more
particularly elevated, re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute the war with vigour, and the
win|ter was &s;pent in preparations on both &s;ides. The Athenians, in their
pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, &s;carce knew where to turn; many of their allied
cities revolted, and it was with the ut|mo&s;t difficulty, that by placing
their forces and fleets at Samos, they reduced &s;uch &s;tates as had abandoned
them to their former obedi|ence, and kept the re&s;t in their duty: thus
&s;till &s;truggling with a part of their former &s;pirit, they kept
them&s;elves in a condition to make head again&s;t their enemies, over whom
they had obtained &s;everal advantages.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, who was well informed of all that pa&s;&s;ed among the
Athenians, &s;ent &s;ecretly to the principal of them at Samos to &s;ound their
&s;enti|ments, and to let them know that he was not aver&s;e to returning to
Athens, provided the admini&s;tration of the republic were put into the hands
of the great and powerful, and not left to the populace, who had expelled him.
Some of the principal officers went from Samos with a de&s;ign to concert with
him the proper mea&s;ures for the &s;ucce&s;s of that undertaking. He
promi&s;ed to procure the Athenians not on|ly <PB N="310" REF="315"> the favour
of the king of Per&s;ia, with whom he had taken refuge, but of the king
him&s;elf, upon condition they would aboli&s;h the demo|cracy, or popular
government; becau&s;e the king would place more confidence in the en|gagements
of the nobility than upon tho&s;e of the incon&s;tant and capricious multitude.
The chief man who oppo&s;ed his return was Phryni|cus, one of the generals,
who, to compa&s;s his de&s;igns, &s;ent word to A&s;tyochus, the Lacedae|momian
general, that Alcibiades was treating with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;aphernes, to bring him over
to the Athenian intere&s;t. He offered farther, to be|tray to him the whole
army and navy of the Athenians. But his trea&s;onable practices being all
detected by the good under&s;tanding betwixt Alcibiades and A&s;tyochus, he was
laid a&s;ide, and afterwards &s;tabbed in the market-place.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Athenians went eagerly forward to complete
that change of go|vernment which had been propo&s;ed to them by Alcibiades; the
democracy began to be aboli&s;h|ed in &s;everal cities of Athens, and &s;oon
after the &s;cheme was carried boldly forward by Py&s;ander, who was chiefly
concerned in this tran&s;action. To give a new form to this government, he 
<PB N="311" REF="316"> cau&s;ed ten commi&s;&s;aries, with ab&s;olute power, to
be appointed, who were, however, at a cer|tain fixed time, to give the people
an account of what they had done. At the expiration of that term, the general
a&s;&s;embly was &s;ummon|ed, wherein their fir&s;t re&s;olution was, that
every one &s;hould be admitted to make &s;uch propo&s;als as he thought fit,
without being liable to any accu&s;ation for infringing the law, or
con&s;equential penalty. It was afterwards decreed, that a new council &s;hould
be formed, with full power to admini&s;ter the public af|fairs, and to elect
new magi&s;trates. For this purpo&s;e, five pre&s;idents were e&s;tabli&s;hed,
who nominated one hundred per&s;ons, including them&s;elves. Each of the&s;e
cho&s;e and a&s;&s;ociated three more at his own plea&s;ure, which made in all
four hundred, in whom an ab&s;olute power was lodged. But to amu&s;e the
people, and to con&s;ole them with a &s;hadow of popular govern|ment, whil&s;t
they in&s;tituted a real oligarchy, it was &s;aid that the four hundred
&s;hould call a council of five thou&s;and citizens to a&s;&s;i&s;t them when
they &s;hould judge it nece&s;&s;ary. The council and a&s;&s;emblies of the
people were held as u&s;ual, nothing was done, however, but by order of the
four hundred. The people of <PB N="312" REF="317"> Athens were deprived in this
manner of their liberty, which they had enjoyed almo&s;t an hun|dred years,
after having aboli&s;hed the tyranny of the Pi&s;i&s;tratides.</P>
<P>This decree being pa&s;&s;ed without oppo&s;ition, after the
&s;eparation of the a&s;&s;embly the four hundred, armed with daggers, and
attended by an hundred and twenty young men, whom they made u&s;e of when any
execution required it, entered the &s;enate, and compelled the &s;enators to
retire, after having paid them the arrears due upon their appointments. They
elected new magi&s;trates out of their own body, ob|&s;erving the u&s;ual
ceremonies upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions. They did not think proper to recall
tho&s;e who were bani&s;hed, le&s;t they &s;hould au|thorize the return of
Alcibiades, who&s;e uncon|troulable &s;pirit they apprehended, and who would
&s;oon have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the people. Abu&s;ing their power in a
tyrannical manner, they put &s;ome to death, others they bani&s;hed, and
confi&s;cated their e&s;tates with im|punity. All who ventured to oppo&s;e this
change, or even to complain of it, were butchered up|on fal&s;e pretexts, and
tho&s;e were intimidated who demanded ju&s;tice of the murderers. The four
hundred, &s;oon after their e&s;tabli&s;hment, <PB N="313" REF="318"> &s;ent
ten deputies to Samos for the army's con|currence to their
e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The army, in the mean time, which was at Samos, prote&s;ted
again&s;t tho&s;e proceedings in the city; and, at the per&s;ua&s;ion of
Thra&s;ybulus, recalled Alcibiades, and created him general, with full power to
&s;ail directly to the Pyraeus and cru&s;h this new tyranny. Alcibiades,
however, would not give way to this ra&s;h opinion, but went fir&s;t to &s;hew
him&s;elf to Ti&s;&s;aphernes, and let him know, that it was now in his power
to treat him as a friend or an enemy. By which means he awed the Athenians with
Ti&s;&s;a|phernes, and Ti&s;&s;aphernes with the Atheni|ans. When, afterwards,
the four hundred &s;ent to Samos to vindicate their proceedings, the army was
for putting the me&s;&s;engers to death, and per&s;i&s;ted in the de&s;ign upon
the Pyraeus, but Alcibiades, by oppo&s;ing it, mani|fe&s;tly &s;aved the
commonwealth.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the innovation in Athens had occa&s;ioned &s;uch
factions and tumults, that the four hundred were more intent upon pro|viding
for their &s;afety than pro&s;ecuting the war. In order to which, they
forti&s;ied that part of the Pyraeus which commands the mouth of the haven, and
re&s;olved, in ca&s;e of extremi|ty, <PB N="314" REF="319"> rather to let in
the Lacedaemonians than expo&s;e their per&s;ons to the fury of their
fellow-citizens. The Spartans took occa&s;ion from the&s;e di&s;turbances, to
hover about with forty-two gallies under the conduct of Hege&s;andri|des; and
the Athenians, with thirty-&s;ix under Timochares, were forced to engage them,
but lo&s;t part of their fleet, and the re&s;t were di&s;|per&s;ed. To add to
which, all Euboea, except Oreus, revolted to the Peloponne&s;ians.</P>
<P>This failure of &s;ucce&s;s &s;erved to give the fini&s;hing blow to
the power of the four hun|dred. The Athenians without delay depo&s;|ed them as
the authors of all their troubles and divi&s;ions under which they groaned.
Al|cibiades was recalled by unanimous con&s;ent, and earne&s;tly &s;ollicited
to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the city. But
judging that if he returned immediately to Athens, he &s;hould owe his recall
to the compa&s;&s;ion and favour of the people, he re&s;olved to render his
return glorious and triumphant, and to de|&s;erve it by &s;ome con&s;iderable
exploit. For this purpo&s;e, leaving Samos with a &s;mall number of &s;hips, he
crui&s;ed about the i&s;land of Cos and Cnidos, and having learnt that
Mindarus, the Spartan admiral, was &s;ailed to the Helle&s;|pont 
<PB N="315" REF="320"> with his whole fleet, and that the Athe|nians were in
pur&s;uit of him, he &s;teered that way with the utmo&s;t diligence to
&s;upport them, and arrived happily with his eighteen ve&s;&s;els at the time
the fleets were engaged near Aby|dos, in a battle which la&s;ted till night,
with|out any advantage on either &s;ide. His arrival gave the Spartans new
courage at fir&s;t, who believed him &s;till their friend, and di&s;pirited the
Athenians. But Alcibiades hanging out the Athenian flag in the admiral's
galley, fell upon them and put them to flight; and ani|mated by his
&s;ucce&s;s, &s;unk their ve&s;&s;els, and made a great &s;laughter of their
&s;oldiers who had thrown them&s;elves into the &s;ea to &s;ave them|&s;elves
by &s;wimming. The Athenians, after having taken thirty of their gallies, and
retaken tho&s;e they had lo&s;t, erected a trophy.</P>
<P>Alcibiades after this victory went to vi&s;it Ti&s;&s;aphernes, who
was &s;o far from receiving him as he expected, that he immediately cau&s;|ed
him to be &s;eized, and &s;ent away pri&s;oner to Sardis, telling him he had
orders from the king to make war upon the Athenians; but the truth is, he was
afraid of being accu&s;ed to his ma&s;ter by the Peloponne&s;ians, and thought,
by this act of inju&s;tice, to purge him&s;elf from <PB N="316" REF="321"> all
former imputations. Alcibiades, after thirty days, made his e&s;cape to
Clazomenae, and &s;oon after bore down upon the Pelopon|ne&s;ian fleet, which
rode at anchor before the port of Cyzicus. With twenty of his be&s;t &s;hips he
broke through the enemy, pur&s;ued tho&s;e who abandoned their &s;hips and fled
to land, and made a great &s;laughter. The Athe|nians took all the enemies
&s;hips, made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of Cyzicus, while Mingimis, the
Lacedaemonian general, was found among the number of the &s;lain.</P>
<P>Alcibiades well knew how to make u&s;e of the victory he had gained;
and, at the head of his conquering forces, took &s;everal cities which had
revolted from the Athenians. Calcedon, Salymbria, and Byzantium, were among the
number. Thus &s;lu&s;hed with conque&s;t, he &s;eemed to de&s;ire nothing &s;o
ardently as to be once more &s;een by his countrymen, as his pre&s;ence would
be a triumph to his friends, and an in|&s;ult to his enemies. Accordingly,
being re|called, he &s;et &s;ail for Athens. Be&s;ides the &s;hips covered with
bucklers and &s;poils of all &s;orts in the manner of trophies, a great number
of ve&s;&s;els al&s;o were towed after him by way of triumph; he di&s;played
al&s;o the en&s;igns and <PB N="317" REF="322"> ornaments of tho&s;e he had
burnt, which were more than the others, the whole amounting to about two
hundred &s;hips. It is &s;aid, that reflecting on what had been done again&s;t
him, upon approaching the port, he was &s;truck with &s;ome terror, and was
afraid to quit his ve&s;&s;el till he &s;aw from the deck a great num|ber of
his friends and relations who were come to the &s;hore to receive him, and
earne&s;tly en|treated him to land. As &s;oon as he was landed, the multitude
who came out to meet him, fixed their eyes on him, thronged about him,
&s;aluted him with loud acclamations, and crowned him with garlands; he
received their congratulations with great &s;atisfaction; he de|&s;ired to be
di&s;charged from his former condem|nation, and obtained from the prie&s;ts an
ab|&s;olution from all their former denunciations.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e triumphs, the real power of Athens
was now no more, the &s;trength of the &s;tate was gone, and even the
pa&s;&s;ion for liberty was lo&s;t in the common de|generacy of the times; many
of the meaner &s;ort of people pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired that Alcibiades would
take the &s;overeignty upon him, they even de&s;ired him to &s;et him&s;elf
above the reach of envy, by &s;ecuring all power in his own 
<PB N="318" REF="323"> per&s;on; the great, however, were not &s;o &s;an|guine
in their gratitude, they were content with appointing him generali&s;&s;imo of
all their forces; they granted him whatever he demand|ed, and gave him for
colleagues the generals mo&s;t agreeable to him. He &s;et &s;ail according|ly,
with an hundred &s;hips, and &s;teered for the i&s;land of Andros that had
revolted, where, having defeated the inhabitants, he went from thence to Samos,
intending to make that the &s;eat of the war. In the mean time, the
Lace|daemonians, ju&s;tly alarmed at his &s;ucce&s;s, made choice of a general
&s;uppo&s;ed to be cap|able of making head again&s;t him; for this rea&s;on,
they fixed upon Ly&s;ander, who, though born of the highe&s;t family, had been
bred up to hard&s;hips, and paid an entire re|&s;pect to the di&s;cipline and
manners of his country. He was brave and a&s;piring, and, like his countrymen,
&s;acrificed all &s;orts of plea&s;ure to his ambition. He had an evenne&s;s
and &s;edatene&s;s of temper which made all condi|tions of life &s;it ea&s;y
upon him, but withal was extremely in&s;inuating, crafty, and de&s;igning, and
made his intere&s;t the only mea&s;ure of truth and fal&s;hood. This deceitful
temper was ob|&s;erved to run through the whole cour&s;e of his 
<PB N="319" REF="324"> life; upon which occa&s;ion it was &s;aid, that he
cheated children with foul play, and men with perjury: and it was a maxim of
his own, that when the lion fails we mu&s;t make u&s;e of the fox.</P>
<P>Ly&s;ander having brought his army to Ephe|&s;us, gave orders for
a&s;&s;embling &s;hips of bur|den from all parts, and erected an ar&s;enal for
building of gallies; he made the ports free for merchants, gave the public
places to artificers, put all arts in motion, and, by the&s;e means, filled the
city with riches, and laid the founda|tion of that magnificence which he
afterwards obtained. Whil&s;t he was making the&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions, he
received advice that Cyrus, the Per&s;ian prince, was arrived at Sardis, he,
therefore, &s;et out from Ephe&s;us to make him a vi&s;it, and to complain of
Ti&s;&s;aphernes, who&s;e duplicity and treachery had been fatal to their
common cau&s;e. Cyrus, who had a per&s;onal enmity to that general, came into
the views of Ly&s;ander, agreed to increa&s;e the &s;eamens pay, and to give
him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.</P>
<P>This large&s;s filled the whole fleet with ardour and alacrity, and
almo&s;t unmanned the enemies gallies, the greate&s;t part of the 
<PB N="320" REF="325"> mariners de&s;erting to the party where the pay was
be&s;t. The Athenians, in de&s;pair, upon receiving this news, endeavoured to
conciliate Cyrus by the interpo&s;ition of Ti&s;&s;aphernes, but he would not
hearken to them, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;atrap repre&s;ented, that it was not
for the king's intere&s;t to aggrandize the Lace|daemonians, but to balance the
power of one &s;ide with that of the other, in order to per|petuate the war,
and to ruin both by their own div&s;ions.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, on the other hand, having oc|ca&s;ion to leave the
fleet, in order to rai&s;e the &s;upplies, gave the command of his fleet to
An|tiochus, with expre&s;s command not to engage or attack the enemy in his
ab&s;ence. Antiochus, however, was willing to do &s;ome action that might
procure him favour without a partner in the glory; he was &s;o far, therefore,
from ob|&s;erving the orders that were given him, that he pre&s;ently &s;ailed
away for Ephe&s;us; and, at the very mouth of the harbour, u&s;ed every art to
provoke the enemy to an engagement. Ly|&s;ander at fir&s;t manned out a few
&s;hips to repel his in&s;ults; but as the Athenian &s;hips advanced to
&s;upport Antiochus, other gallies belonging to the Lacedaemonians al&s;o came
on, till both <PB N="321" REF="326"> fleets arrived by little and little, and
the en|gagement became general on both &s;ides. Ly|&s;ander at length was
victorious; Antiochus was &s;lain, and fifteen Athenian gallies were taken. It
was in vain that Alcibiades &s;oon after came up to the relief of his friends;
it was in vain that he offered to renew the com|bat, Ly&s;ander, content with
the victory he had gained, was unwilling again to tru&s;t to for|tune.</P>
<P>The fickle multitude of Athens again, therefore, began to accu&s;e
Alcibiades of in|&s;ufficiency. He who was ju&s;t before re&s;pected even to
adoration, was now di&s;carded upon a groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picion, that he had
not done his duty. But it was the glory he had obtained by his pa&s;t
&s;ervices that now ruined him; for his continual &s;ucce&s;s had begot in the
people &s;uch an opinion of him, that they thought it impo&s;&s;ible for him to
fail in any thing he un|dertook, and from thence his enemies took oc|ca&s;ion
to que&s;tion his integrity, and to impute to him both his own and other
mi&s;carriages. Callicratidas was appointed to &s;ucceed Ly&s;an|der, who&s;e
year was expired; alike &s;evere to him&s;elf and others, inacce&s;&s;ible to
flattery and &s;loth, the declared enemy of luxury, he re|tained the mode&s;ty,
temperance, and au&s;terity <PB N="322" REF="327"> of the ancient Spartans,
virtues that began to di&s;tingui&s;h him particularly, as they were not too
common in his time. His probity and ju&s;tice were proof again&s;t all things;
his &s;im|plicity and integrity abhorred all fal&s;hood and fraud, to which
were joined a truly Spartan noblene&s;s and grandeur of &s;oul. The fir&s;t
at|tempt of the new admiral was again&s;t Me|thymna, in Le&s;bos, which he took
by &s;torm. He then threatened Conon, who was appoint|ed general of the
Athenians, that he would make him leave <HI>debauching</HI> the &s;ea, and
accord|ingly &s;oon after pur&s;ued him into the port of Mytilene with an
hundred and &s;eventy &s;ail, took thirty of his &s;hips, and be&s;ieged him in
the town, from which he cut off all provi&s;ions. He &s;oon after took ten
&s;hips more out of twelve which were coming to his relief. Then hear|ing that
the Athenians had fitted out their whole &s;trength, con&s;i&s;ting of an
hundred and fifty &s;ail; he left fifty of his &s;hips, under Etoni|cus to
carry on the &s;iege of Mytilene, and with an hundred and twenty more met the
Atheni|ans at Arginu&s;ae, over again&s;t Le&s;bos. His pilot advi&s;ed him to
retreat, for that the enemy was &s;uperior in number. He told him that Sparta
would be never the wor&s;e inhabited though he were &s;lain. The fight was long
and ob&s;tinate, <PB N="323" REF="328"> until at la&s;t the &s;hips of
Callicratidas charg|ng through the enemy was &s;unk, and the re&s;t fled. The
Peloponne&s;ians lo&s;t about &s;eventy &s;ail, and the Athenians twenty-five,
with mo&s;t of the men in them. The Athenian admirals, who had the joint
command of the &s;leet, in|&s;tead of being rewarded for &s;o &s;ignal a
victory, were made a barbarous in&s;tance of the power and ingratitude of their
fellow-citizens. Upon a relation of the fight before the &s;enate, it was
alledged, they had &s;uffered their men who were &s;hipwrecked to be lo&s;t
when they might have &s;aved them; upon which, they were clapped in irons in
order to an&s;wer it to the people. They urged in their defence, that they were
pur&s;uing the enemy; and, at the &s;ame time, gave orders about taking up the
men to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it more peculiarly was, particularly to
Theramenes, who was now their accu&s;er; but yet, that their orders could not
be executed by rea&s;on of a violent &s;torm which happened at that time. This
&s;eemed &s;o rea&s;onable and &s;ati&s;|factory, that &s;everal &s;tood up and
offered to bail them: but, in another a&s;&s;embly, the po|pular incendiaries
demanded ju&s;tice, and &s;o awed the judges, that Socrates was the only man
who had courage enough to declare, he would do nothing contrary to law, and
accord|ingly <PB N="324" REF="329"> refu&s;ed to act. After a long debate,
eight of the ten were condemned, and &s;ix of them were put to death, among
whom was Pericles, &s;on of the great Pericles. He declared, that they had
failed in nothing of their duty, as they had given orders that the dead bodies
&s;hould be taken up; that if any one were guilty, it was he, who being charged
with the&s;e orders, had neglected to put them in execution, but that he
accu&s;ed nobody, and that the tempe&s;t which came on unexpectedly, at the
very in&s;tant, was an unan&s;werable apology, and entirely di&s;charged the
accu&s;ed from all guilt. He demanded that a whole day &s;hould be allowed them
to make their defence, a favour not denied to the mo&s;t criminal, and that
they &s;hould be tried &s;eparately. He repre&s;ented, that they were not in
the lea&s;t obliged to pre|cipitate a &s;entence wherein the lives of the
mo&s;t Illu&s;trious of the citizens were concerned; that it was in &s;ome
mea&s;ure attacking the gods, to make men re&s;pon&s;ible for the winds and
weather; that they could not without the mo&s;t flagrant ingratitude and
inju&s;tice put the con|querors to death, to whom they ought to de|cree crowns
and honours, or give up the de|fenders of their country to the rage of tho&s;e
who envied them; that if they did &s;o, their <PB N="325" REF="330"> unju&s;t
judgment would be followed by a &s;ud|den, but vain repentance, which would
leave behind it the &s;harpe&s;t remor&s;e, and cover them with eternal &s;hame
and infamy; among the number al&s;o was Diomedon, a per&s;on equally eminent
for his valour and his probity, as he was carrying to execution, he demanded to
be heard. 
<Q REND="inline">"Athenians, &s;aid he, I wi&s;h the &s;en|tence you
have pa&s;&s;ed upon us may not prove the misfortune of the republic; but I
have one favour to a&s;k of you in behalf of my col|leagues and my&s;elf, which
is to acquit us be|fore the gods of the vows we made to them for you and
our&s;elves, as we are not in a condi|tion to di&s;charge them, for it is to
their pro|tection invoked before the battle, we acknow|ledge that we are
indebted for the victory gained by us over the enemy."</Q> There was not a good
citizen that did not melt into tears at this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o full of
goodne&s;s and religion, and admire with &s;urprize the moderation of a
per&s;on, who &s;eeing him&s;elf unju&s;tly condemned, did not however vent the
lea&s;t re&s;entment, or even complaint again&s;t his judges, but was &s;olely
intent (in favour of an ungrateful coun|try which had doomed them to peri&s;h)
upon what it owed to the gods in common with them for the victory they had
lately obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="331"> This complication of inju&s;tice and
ingrati|tude &s;eemed to give the fini&s;hing blow to the affairs of the
Athenian &s;tate; they &s;truggled for a while after their defeat at
Syracu&s;e, but from hence they were entirely &s;unk, though &s;eemingly in the
arms of victory.</P>
<P>The enemy after their la&s;t defeat had once more recour&s;e to
Ly&s;ander, who had &s;o often led them to conque&s;t; on him they placed their
chief confidence, and ardently &s;olicited his return. The Lacedaemonians, to
gratify their allies, and yet to ob&s;erve their laws, which forbad that honour
being conferred twice on the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;ent him with an inferior
title, but with the power of admiral. Thus appoint|ed, Ly&s;ander &s;ailed
towards the Helle&s;pont, and laid &s;iege to Lamp&s;acus; the place was
carried by &s;torm, and abandoned by Ly&s;ander to the mercy of the &s;oldiers.
The Athenians, who followed him clo&s;e, upon the news of his &s;ucce&s;s
&s;teered forward towards Ole&s;tus, and from thence &s;ailing along the
coa&s;t, halted over-again&s;t the enemy at Aegos Potamos, a place fatal for
the Athenians.</P>
<P>The Helle&s;pont is not above two thou&s;and paces broad in that
place. The two armies &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;o near each other, expected only
to re&s;t that day, and were in hopes of <PB N="327" REF="332"> coming to a
battle on the next. But Ly&s;ander had another de&s;ign in view; he commanded
the &s;eamen and pilots to go on board their gallies, as if they were in
reality to fight the next morning at break of day, to hold them|&s;elves in
readine&s;s, and to wait his orders in profound &s;ilence. He ordered the land
army in like manner to draw up in battle upon the coa&s;t, and to wait the day
without any noi&s;e. On the morning as &s;oon as the &s;un was ri&s;en, the
Athenians began to row towards them with their whole fleet in one line, and to
bid them defiance. Ly&s;ander, though his &s;hips were ranged in order of
battle, with their heads to|wards the enemy, lay &s;till without making any
movement. In the evening when the Athe|nians withdrew, he did not &s;uffer his
&s;oldiers to go a&s;hore till two or three gallies which he had &s;ent out to
ob&s;erve them, were returned with advice, that they had &s;een the enemy land.
The next day pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame man|ner, as did the third and fourth.
Such a con|duct, which argued re&s;erve and apprehen&s;ion, extremely augmented
the &s;ecurity and boldne&s;s of the Athenians, and in&s;pired them with an
high contempt for an army, which fear pre|vented from &s;hewing them&s;elves or
attempting any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333"> Whil&s;t this pa&s;&s;ed, Alcibiades, who was
near the fleet, took hor&s;e and came to the Athenian generals, to whom he
repre&s;ented, that they kept upon a very di&s;advantageous coa&s;t, where
there were neither ports nor ci|ties in the neighbourhood; that they were
ob|liged to bring their provi&s;ions from Se&s;tos, with great danger and
difficulty, and that they were very much in the wrong to &s;uffer the
&s;oldiers and mariners of the fleet, as &s;oon as they were a&s;hore to
&s;traggle and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves at their plea&s;ure, whil&s;t the
enemy's fleet faced them in view, accu&s;tomed to execute the or|ders of their
general with in&s;tant obedience, and upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ignal. He
offered al&s;o to attack the enemy by land with a &s;trong body of Thracian
troops and to force them to a battle. The generals, e&s;pecially Tydeus and
Menander, jealous of their command, did not content them&s;elves with
refu&s;ing his offers, from the opinion, that if the event proved un|fortunate,
the whole blame would fall upon them, and if favourable, that Alcibiades would
engro&s;s the honour of it, but rejected al&s;o with in&s;ult his wi&s;e and
&s;alutary coun&s;el, as if a man in di&s;grace lo&s;t his &s;en&s;e and
abilities with the favour of the commonwealth. Alcibiades withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="334"> The fifth day the Athenians pre&s;ented
them|&s;elves again, and offered him battle, retiring in the evening according
to cu&s;tom with more in&s;ulting airs than the days before. Ly&s;ander, as
u&s;ual, detached &s;ome gallies to ob&s;erve them, with orders to return with
the utmo&s;t diligence when they &s;aw the Athenians landed, and to put a brown
buckler at each &s;hip's head as &s;oon as they reached the middle of the
channel. Him&s;elf, in the mean time, ran through the whole line in his galley,
exhort|ing the pilots and officers to hold the &s;eamen and &s;oldiers in
readine&s;s to row and fight on the fir&s;t &s;ignal.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the bucklers were put up in the &s;hip's heads, and the
admiral's galley had given the &s;ignal by the &s;ound of trumpet, the whole
fleet &s;et forwards in good order. The land army, at the &s;ame time, made all
po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to the top of the promontory to &s;ee the battle. The
&s;treight that &s;eparates the two continents in this place is about fifteen
&s;tadia, or three quarters of a league in breadth, which &s;pace was
pre&s;ently cleared through the activity and diligence of the rowers. Conon,
the Atheni|an general, was the fir&s;t who perceived from &s;hore the enemy's
fleet advance in good order to attack him, upon which he immediately cri|ed 
<PB N="330" REF="335"> out for the troops to embark. In the height of &s;orrow
and perplexity, &s;ome he call|ed to by their names, &s;ome he conjured, and
others he forced to go on board their gallies, but all his endeavours and
emotion were in|effectual, the &s;oldiers being di&s;per&s;ed on all &s;ides.
For they were no &s;ooner come on &s;hore than &s;ome were run to the
&s;uttlers, &s;ome to walk in the country, &s;ome to &s;leep in their tents,
and others had began to dre&s;s their &s;up|pers. This proceeded from the want
of vigi|lance and experience in their generals, who, not &s;u&s;pecting the
lea&s;t danger, indulged them|&s;elves in taking their repo&s;e, and gave their
&s;ol|diers the &s;ame liberty.</P>
<P>The enemy had already fallen on with loud cries, and a great noi&s;e
of their oars, when Conon di&s;engaging him&s;elf with nine gallies, of which
number was the &s;acred &s;hip, he &s;tood away for Cyprus, where he took
re|fuge with Evagoras. The Peloponne&s;ians falling upon the re&s;t of the
fleet, took im|mediately the gallies which were empty, and di&s;abled and
de&s;troyed &s;uch as began to fill with men. The &s;oldiers who ran without
or|der or arms to their relief, were either killed in the endeavour to get on
board, or flying on &s;hore, were cut to pieces by the enemy, who 
<PB N="331" REF="336"> landed in pur&s;uit of them. Ly&s;ander took three
thou&s;and pri&s;oners, with all the generals, and the whole fleet, after
having plundered the camp, and fa&s;tened the enemy's gallies to the &s;terns
of his own, he returned to Lamp&s;a|cus amid&s;t the &s;ounds of flutes and
&s;ongs of triumph. It was his glory to have atchieved one of the greate&s;t
military exploits recorded in hi&s;tory with little or no lo&s;s, and to have
terminated a war in the &s;mall &s;pace of an hour which had already la&s;ted
&s;even and twenty years, and which, perhaps, without him had been of much
longer continuance. Ly&s;ander immediately &s;ent di&s;patches with this
agreeable news to Sparta.</P>
<P>The three thou&s;and pri&s;oners taken in this battle having been
condemned to die, Ly&s;an|der called upon Philocles, one of the Athenian
generals, who had cau&s;ed all the pri&s;oners taken in two gallies, the one of
Andros, the other of Corinth, to be thrown from the top of a precipice, and had
formerly per&s;uaded the people of Athens to make a decree for cutting off the
thumb of the right hand of all the pri&s;oners of war, in order to di&s;able
them for handling the pike, and that they might be fit only to &s;erve at the
oar. Ly&s;ander, there|fore, cau&s;ed him to be brought forth, and 
<PB N="332" REF="337"> a&s;ked him what &s;entence he would pa&s;s upon
him&s;elf for having induced his city to pa&s;s that cruel decree. Philocles,
without depart|ing from his haughtine&s;s in the lea&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding
the extreme danger he was in, made an&s;wer: 
<Q REND="inline">"Accu&s;e not people of crimes who have no judges,
but as you are victors, u&s;e your right, and do by us as we had done by you if
we had conquered."</Q> At the &s;ame in|&s;tant he went into a bath, put on
afterwards a magnificent robe, and marched foremo&s;t to the execution. All the
pri&s;oners were put to the &s;word except Adamantus, who had oppo&s;|ed the
decree.</P>
<P>When the news of the entire defeat of the army came to Athens, by a
&s;hip which arrived in the night at the Piraeus, the city was in
con&s;ternation. They naturally expected a &s;iege; and, in fact, Ly&s;ander
was preparing to be&s;iege them. Nothing was heard but cries of &s;orrow and
de&s;pair in every part of it. They imagined the enemy already at their gates;
they repre&s;ented to them&s;elves the mi&s;eries of a long &s;iege, a cruel
famine, the ruin and burning of their city, the in&s;olence of a proud victor,
and the &s;hameful &s;lavery they were upon the point of experiencing, more
afflict|ing and in&s;upportable to them than the mo&s;t <PB N="333" REF="338">
&s;evere puni&s;hments, and death it&s;elf. The next day the a&s;&s;embly was
&s;ummoned, where|in it was re&s;olved to &s;hut up all the ports, one only
excepted, to repair the breaches in the walls, and mount guard to prepare
again&s;t a &s;iege.</P>
<P>Their fears were &s;oon confirmed by reality. Ly&s;ander finding
numbers of Athenians di&s;|per&s;ed in different cities, commanded them all on
pain of death to take &s;helter in Athens. This he did with a de&s;ign, &s;o to
croud the city as to be able &s;oon to reduce it by famine. In effect, he
&s;oon after arrived at the port of Athens with an hundred and fifty &s;ail.
While Agis and Pau&s;anias, the two kings of Sparta, advanced with their army
to be&s;iege it by land.</P>
<P>The wretched Athenians thus hemmed in on every &s;ide, without
provi&s;ions, &s;hips, or hopes of relief, prepared to meet the la&s;t
ex|tremity with patience; in this manner, with|out &s;peaking the lea&s;t word
of a capitulation, and dying in the &s;treets by numbers, they ob|&s;tinately
continued on the defen&s;ive; but, at length, their corn and provi&s;ions being
entire|ly con&s;umed, they found them&s;elves compelled to &s;end deputies to
Agis, with offers of aban|doning all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their city and 
<PB N="334" REF="339"> port only excepted. The haughty Lacedae|monian referred
their deputies to the &s;tate it|&s;elf, and when the &s;uppliant deputies had
made known their commi&s;&s;ion to the ephori, they were ordered to retire, and
to come with other propo&s;als if they expected peace. At length, Theramenes,
an Athenian, undertook to manage the treaty with Ly&s;ander; and, af|ter three
months of clo&s;e conference, he re|ceived full powers to treat at Lacedaemon.
When he, attended by nine others, arrived be|fore the ephori, it was there
&s;trongly urged by &s;ome of the confederates, that Athens &s;hould be totally
de&s;troyed, without hearken|ing to any farther propo&s;als. But the
Lace|daemonians told them, they would not de&s;troy a city which had &s;o
eminently re&s;cued Greece in the mo&s;t critical juncture, and con&s;ented to
a peace upon the&s;e conditions: that the long walls and fortifications of the
Piraeus &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that they &s;hould deliver up all their
&s;hips but twelve; that they &s;hould re&s;tore their exiles; that they
&s;hould make a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with the Lace|daemonians,
and &s;erve them in all their expe|ditions, both by &s;ea and land. Theramenes
be|ing returned with the articles to Athens, was a&s;ked why he acted &s;o
contrary to the inten|tions <PB N="335" REF="340"> of Themi&s;tocles, and gave
tho&s;e walls in|to the hands of the Lacedaemonians which he built in defiance
of them? I have my eye, &s;ays he, upon Themi&s;tocles his de&s;ign; he
rai&s;ed the&s;e walls for the pre&s;ervation of the city, and I for the very
&s;ame rea&s;on would have them de&s;troyed; for, if walls only &s;ecure a
city, Sparta, which has none, is in a very ill condition. The Athenians, at
another time, would not have thought this a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, but being
reduced to the la&s;t extremi|ty, it did not admit of a long debate whether
they &s;hould accept the treaty. At la&s;t, Ly&s;an|der coming up the Piraeus,
demoli&s;hed the walls with great &s;olemnity, and all the in&s;ulting triumphs
of mu&s;ic. Thus a final period was put to this unhappy war, which had
con|tinued for &s;even and twenty years, in which heaps of trea&s;ure and
deluge of blood were exhau&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. From the Demolition of the ATHENIAN Power to the Death
of SOCRATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE victory of Ly&s;ander was &s;o terrible a &s;hock to Athens,
that it only &s;urvived to be &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s of its own power;
however, the conquerors were &s;o generous as not to ex|tingui&s;h the name;
they &s;aid they would not be guilty of putting out one of the eyes of Greece:
but they impo&s;ed &s;ome farther marks of conque&s;t on them; they obliged the
people to demoli&s;h the democracy, and &s;ubmit to the government of thirty
men, who were common|ly known by the name of the thirty tyrants. Though the
Greeks were apt enough to give that name to men of virtuous characters, the&s;e
men, who were the creatures of Ly&s;ander, in every re&s;pect de&s;erved the
mo&s;t opprobrious de|nomination; in&s;tead of compiling and publi&s;hing a
more perfect body of laws, which was the pre|tence for their being cho&s;en,
they began to exert their power of life and death: and though they
con&s;tituted a &s;enate, and other magi&s;trates, they made no farther u&s;e
of them than to confirm <PB N="337" REF="342"> their authority, and to &s;ee
their commands executed. However, they at fir&s;t acted cau|tiou&s;ly, and
condemned only the mo&s;t dete&s;ted and &s;candalous part of the citizens,
&s;uch as lived by evidencing and informing; but this was only to give a colour
to their proceedings; their de&s;ign was to make them&s;elves ab&s;olute, and
knowing that was not to be done without a foreign power, their next &s;tep was
to de&s;ire a guard might be &s;ent them from Sparta, until &s;uch times as
they could clear the city of all di&s;affected per&s;ons, and thoroughly
&s;ettle the government. Ly&s;ander, accordingly, pro|cured them a guard under
the command of Callibius, who, by bribes and artifices, was wrought over to
their de&s;igns, and then &s;een to act without controul, filling the city with
the blood of tho&s;e who, on account of their riches, intere&s;t, or good
qualities, were mo&s;t likely to make head again&s;t them.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t acts of their cruelty was in procuring the death
of Alcibiades, who had taken refuge in the dominions of Per&s;ia. This
unfortunate general, &s;till mindful of the debt he owed his country, employed
his utmo&s;t at|tention in giving it the earlie&s;t notices of what could
effect its freedom or its &s;afety. Cyrus, the prince of Per&s;ia, having
re&s;olved to de|throne <PB N="338" REF="343"> his brother Artaxerxes, entered
into a treaty with the Lacedaemonians to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his de&s;igns.
Alcibiades did all that was in his power to ob&s;truct the &s;cheme; but the
Lace|daemonian parti&s;ans at Athens, that is to &s;ay, the thirty tyrants,
apprehended the intrigues of &s;o &s;uperior a genius as his, and repre&s;ented
to their ma&s;ters that they were inevitably ruined, if they did not find means
to rid them&s;elves of Alcibiades. The Lacedaemonians thereupon wrote to
Pharnaba&s;us, and with an abject meanne&s;s not to be excu&s;ed, and which
&s;hewed how much Sparta had degenerated from her ancient manners, made
pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances to him to deliver them at any rate from &s;o
formid|able an enemy. This &s;atrap complied with their wi&s;hes. Alcibiades
was then in a &s;mall town of Phrygia, where he lived with his concubine
Timandra. Tho&s;e who were &s;ent to kill him not daring to enter his hou&s;e,
contented them|&s;elves with &s;urrounding and &s;etting it on fire. Alcibiades
having quitted it through the flames, &s;word in hand, the barbarians were
afraid to &s;tay to come to blows with him, but &s;lying and retreating as he
advanced, they poured their darts and arrows upon him from a di&s;tance, and he
fell dead upon the &s;pot. Timandra took up his body, and having adorned and
covered <PB N="339" REF="344"> it with the fine&s;t robes &s;he had, &s;he made
as magnificent a funeral for it as her pre&s;ent con|dition would admit.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Alcibiades, who&s;e great virtues were &s;tifled
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by &s;till greater vices. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay
whether his good or bad qualities were mo&s;t pernicious to his country, for
with the one he deceived, and with the other he oppre&s;&s;ed it. In him
di&s;tingui&s;hed valour was united with nobility of blood. His per&s;on was
beautiful and finely made; he was eloquent, of great ability in af|fairs,
in&s;inuating, and formed for charming all mankind. He loved glory, but without
prejudice to his inclination &s;or plea&s;ure, nor was he &s;o fond of
plea&s;ure as to neglect his glory for it: he knew how to give into, or
ab|&s;tract him&s;elf from the allurements of luxury, ac|cording to the
&s;ituation of his affaris. Never was there ductility of genius equal to his,
he meta|morpho&s;ed him&s;elf with incredible facility, into the mo&s;t
contrary forms, and &s;upported them all with as much ea&s;e and grace as if
each had been natural to him.</P>
<P>In this manner the thirty proceeded, and fearing to be oppo&s;ed by
the multitude, they inve&s;ted three thou&s;and citizens with &s;ome part 
<PB N="340" REF="345"> of their power, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
pre&s;erv|ed the re&s;t. But thoroughly emblodened by &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion
to their party, they agreed to &s;ingle out every one his man, to put them to
death, and &s;eize their e&s;tates for the main|tenance of their garti&s;on.
Theramenes, one of their number, was the only man that was &s;truck with horror
at their proceedings; where|fore Critias, the principal author, thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to remove him, and accu&s;ed him to the &s;enate of endeavouring
to &s;ubvert the &s;tate. Sentence of death was, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed up|on
him, and he was obliged to drink the juice of hemlock, the u&s;ual mode of
execution at that time in Athens. Socrates, who&s;e di&s;ciple he had been, was
the only per&s;on of the &s;enate who ventured to appear in his defence; he
made an attempt to re&s;cue him out of the hands of the officer of ju&s;tice,
and after his execution went about as it were in defiance of the thirty,
exhorting and animating the &s;enators and citi|zens again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The tyrants, delivered from a colleague who&s;e pre&s;ence alone was
a continual reproach to them, no longer ob&s;erved any mea&s;ures. Nothing
pa&s;&s;ed throughout the city but impri|&s;onments and murders. Every body
trembled <PB N="341" REF="346"> for them&s;elves or their friends. The general
de&s;olation had no remedy, nor was there any hope of regaining lo&s;t
liberty.</P>
<P>All the citizens of any con&s;ideration in Athens, and who retained
a love of freedom, quitted a place reduced to &s;o hard and &s;hame|ful a
&s;lavery, and &s;ought el&s;ewhere an a&s;ylum and retreat where they might
live in &s;afety. The Lacedaemonians had the inhumanity to en|deavour to
deprive tho&s;e unhappy fugitives of this la&s;t re&s;ource. They publi&s;hed
an edict to prohibit the cities of Greece from giving them refuge, decreed that
they &s;hould be delivered up to the thirty tyrants, and condemned all &s;uch
as &s;hould contravene the execution of this edict to pay a fine of five
talents. Only two cities rejected with di&s;dain &s;o unju&s;t an or|dinance,
Megara and Thebes, the latter of which made a decree to puni&s;h all per&s;ons
what&s;oever that &s;hould &s;ee an Athenian attack|ed by his enemies without
doing his utmo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Ly&s;ias, an orator of Syracu&s;e, who
had been bani&s;hed by the thirty, rai&s;ed five hundred &s;oldiers at his own
expence, and &s;ent them to the aid of the common country of eloquence.</P>
<P>Thra&s;ybulus, a man of admirable character, who had long deplored
the mi&s;eries of his coun|try, <PB N="342" REF="347"> was now the fir&s;t to
relieve it. At Thebes he fell into a con&s;ultation with his fellow-citi|zens,
and the re&s;ult was, that &s;ome vigorous effort, though it carried never &s;o
much dan|ger, ought to be made for the benefit of public liberty. Accordingly,
with a par|ty of thirty men only, as Nepos &s;ays; but, as Xenophon more
probably &s;ays, of near &s;even|ty, he &s;eized upon Phyle, a &s;trong
ca&s;tle on the frontiers of Attica. This enterprize gave the alarm to the
tyrants, who immediately march|ed out of Athens with their three thou&s;and
followers, and their Spartan guard, and attempt|ed the recovery of the place,
but were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. Finding they could not carry it by a &s;udden
a&s;&s;ault, they re&s;olved upon a &s;iege, but not being &s;ufficiently
provided for that &s;er|vice, and a great &s;now falling that night, they were
forced to retire the next day into the city, leaving only part of their guard
to prevent any farther excur&s;ions into the country. Encou|raged by this
&s;ucce&s;s, Thra&s;ybulus no longer kept him&s;elf confined, but marched out
of Phyle by night; and, at the head of a body of a thou&s;and men, &s;eized on
the Pyraeus. The thirty flew thither with their troops, and a battle
&s;ufficiently warm en&s;ued; but, as the &s;oldiers on one &s;ide fought with
valour and <PB N="343" REF="348"> vigour for their liberty, and, on the other
with, indolence and neglect for the power of their op|pre&s;&s;ors, the
&s;ucce&s;s was not doubtful, but fol|lowed the better cau&s;e: the tyrants
were over|thrown; Critias was killed upon the &s;pot; and, as the re&s;t of the
army were taking to flight, Thra&s;ybulus cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Wherefore do you fly from me as from a victor,
rather than a&s;&s;i&s;t me as the avenger of your liberty? We are not enemies,
but fellow-citizens, nor have we declared war again&s;t the city, but again&s;t
the thirty tyrants."</Q> He continued, with bid|ding them remember that they
had the &s;ame origin, country, laws, and religion; he exhort|ed them to
compa&s;&s;ionate their exiled brethren, to re&s;tore to them their country,
and re&s;ume their liberty them&s;elves. This di&s;cour&s;e had &s;uitable
effects. The army upon their return to Athens, expelled the thirty, and
&s;ub&s;tituted ten per&s;ons to govern in their room, but who&s;e conduct
proved no better than that of tho&s;e whom they &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Though the government was thus altered, and the thirty were
depo&s;ed from power, they &s;till had hopes of being rein&s;tated in their
for|mer authority, and &s;ent deputies to Lace|daemon to demand aid. Ly&s;ander
was for <PB N="344" REF="349"> granting it to them, but Pau&s;anias, who then
reigned in Sparta, moved with compa&s;&s;ion at the deplorable condition of the
Athenians, favoured them in &s;ecret, and obtained a peace for them; it was
&s;ealed with the blood of the tyrants, who having taken arms to rein&s;tate
them&s;elves in government, were put to the &s;word, and Athens left in full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its liberty. Thra&s;ybulus then propo&s;ed an am|ne&s;ty,
by which the citizens engaged upon oath that all pa&s;t actions &s;hould be
buried in oblivion, and the government was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in its ancient
forms; their laws were re&s;tored to their pa&s;t vigour, the magi&s;trates
elected with the u&s;ual ceremonies, and democracy was once more re&s;tored to
this unfortunate people. Xenophon ob&s;erves, that this inte&s;tine fury had
con&s;umed as many in eight months, as the Peloponne&s;ian war had done in ten
years.</P>
<P>Upon the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of affairs in Athens, the other
&s;tates enjoyed the &s;ame tranquility, or rather kept in a quiet
&s;ubjec|tion to Sparta, which now held the undoubted &s;overeignty of Greece.
But it being a maxim with the Spartans, that this &s;overeignty was not to be
maintained but by a con&s;tant cour&s;e of action; they were &s;till &s;eeking
fre&s;h occa|&s;ions <PB N="345" REF="350"> for war; and part of their forces,
to|gether with another body of Grecians, being at this time engaged in a
quarrel between the Per&s;ian king and his brother, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary
to pa&s;s over into A&s;ia, and relate &s;o much of the Per&s;ian affairs as
concerns the expedition of Cyrus, wherein tho&s;e forces were employed,
e&s;pecially &s;ince it is attended with circum|&s;tances which, if duly
con&s;idered, will ea&s;ily make it pa&s;s for one of the greate&s;t actions of
antiquity.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that Cyrus, the &s;on of Darius
Nothus, &s;aw with pain his elder brother Artaxerxes upon the throne, and more
than once attempted to remove him. Arta|xerxes was not in&s;en&s;ible of what
he had to fear from a brother of his enterpri&s;ing and am|bitious &s;pirit,
but could not refu&s;e pardoning him on the prayers and tears of his mother
Pary&s;atis, who doated upon this younge&s;t &s;on. He removed him, therefore,
into A&s;ia to his go|vernment, confiding in him contrary to all the rules of
policy, an ab&s;olute authority over the provinces left him by the will of the
king his father. He was no &s;ooner appointed in this manner, but he u&s;ed all
his arts with the bar|barians and the Grecians to procure power and 
<PB N="346" REF="351"> popularity, in order to dethrone his brother. Clearches
retired to his court, after having been bani&s;hed from Sparta, and was of
great &s;ervice to him, being an able, experienced, and valiant captain. At the
&s;ame time, &s;everal cities in the provinces of Ti&s;&s;aphernes revolted
from their obedience in favour of Cyrus. This incident, which was not an effect
of chance, but of the &s;ecret practices of that prince, gave birth to a war
between the two brothers. The emi&s;&s;aries of Cyrus at the court, were
perpetu|ally di&s;per&s;ing reports and opinions among&s;t the people to
prepare their minds for the in|tended change and revolt. They talked that the
&s;tate required a king of Cyrus's character, a king magnificent, liberal, who
loved war, and &s;howered his favours upon tho&s;e that &s;erv|ed him; and that
it was nece&s;&s;ary, for the grandeur of the empire, to have a prince up|on
the throne &s;ired with ambition and valour, for the &s;upport and augmentation
of his glory.</P>
<P>The troops of Cyrus, which were apparent|ly levied for the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, but in fact to overturn it, con&s;i&s;ted of
thirteen thou|&s;and Greeks, which were the flower and chief force of his army.
Clearches, the La|cedaemonian, <PB N="347" REF="352"> who commanded the
Pelopon|ne&s;ian troops, was the only man of all the Greeks that was let into
the Per&s;ian prince's de&s;ign; he made it his &s;ole application to gain the
affections of his people during their marches, by treating them with humanity,
conver&s;ing freely with them, and giving ef|fectual orders that they &s;hould
want for no|thing. The Grecian troops knew neither the intent nor the
occa&s;ion of the war; they &s;et out for Sardis, at length, and marched
towards the upper provinces of Athens.</P>
<P>When they were arrived at Tarfus, the Greeks refu&s;ed to march any
farther, rightly &s;u&s;pecting that they were intended again&s;t the king, and
loudly exclaiming that they had not entered into the &s;ervice upon that
condition. Clearchus, who commanded them, had occa|&s;ion for all his addre&s;s
and ability to &s;tifle this commotion in its birth. At fir&s;t he made u&s;e
of authority and force, but with very ill &s;ucce&s;s, and de&s;i&s;ted
therefore from an open oppo&s;ition to their &s;entiments: he even affect|ed to
enter into their views, and to &s;upport them with his approbation and credit.
By this artful eva&s;ion he appea&s;ed the tumult, and made them ea&s;y; and
they cho&s;e him and &s;ome other officers for their deputies. Cyrus, whom 
<PB N="348" REF="353"> he had &s;ecretly appri&s;ed of every thing, made
an&s;wer, that he was going to attack Abro|comas, his enemy, at twelve days
march from thence upon the Euphrates. When this an|&s;wer was repeated to them,
though they plain|ly &s;aw again&s;t whom they were going, they re|&s;olved to
proceed, and only demanded an aug|mentation of their pay. Cyrus, in&s;tead of
one daric a month to each &s;oldier, promi&s;ed to give them one and a half.
Still to ingratiate him&s;elf the more, being told that two officers had
de&s;erted from the army, and being advi&s;|ed to pur&s;ue and put them to
death, he de|clared publicly, that it &s;hould never be &s;aid he had detained
any one per&s;on in his &s;ervice again&s;t his will; and he ordered their
wives and children, who were left as ho&s;tages in his army, to be &s;ent after
them. A conduct &s;o wi&s;e, and apparently generous, had a &s;urpri&s;|ing
effect in conciliating the affections of the &s;oldiery, and made even tho&s;e
his firm adhe|rents who were before inclined to retire.</P>
<P>As Cyrus advanced by long marches, he was informed from all parts,
that the king did not intend to come directly to a battle, but had re|&s;olved
to wait in the remote&s;t parts of Per&s;ia till all his forces were
a&s;&s;embled; and that, to &s;top his enemies, he had ordered an intrench|ment
<PB N="349" REF="354"> to be thrown up on the plains of Babylon, with a ditch
of five fathoms broad, and three deep, extending the &s;pace of twelve
para&s;angs, or leagues, from the Euphrates to the wall of Media. Between the
Euphrates and the ditch, a way had been left of twenty feet in breadth, by
which Cyrus pa&s;&s;ed with his whole army, having reviewed it the day before.
The king had neglected to di&s;pute this pa&s;s with him, and &s;uffered him to
continue his march towards Babylon.</P>
<P>Cyrus &s;till continued to proceed, giving Clearches the command of
the right Grecian wing, and Menon that of the left, &s;till march|ing in order
of battle, expecting every hour to engage; at length he di&s;covered his
bro|ther's army, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve hundred thou&s;and men, be&s;ides a
&s;elect body of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, approaching and preparing to
engage.</P>
<P>The place where the battle was fought was called Cunara, about
twenty-five leagues from Babylon. Cyrus getting on hor&s;eback, with his
javelin in his hand, gave orders to the troops to &s;tand to their arms, and
proceed in order of battle. The enemy, in the mean time, advanced &s;lowly, in
good order. Arta|xerxes led them on regularly with a &s;low pace, 
<PB N="350" REF="355"> without noi&s;e or confu&s;ion. That good order and
exact di&s;cipline extremely &s;urpri&s;ed the Greeks, who expected to &s;ee
much luxury and tumult in &s;o great a multitude, and to hear confu&s;ed cries,
as Cyrus had foretold them.</P>
<P>The armies were not di&s;tant above four or five hundred paces, when
the Greeks began to &s;ing the hymn of battle, and to march on &s;oftly at
fir&s;t, and with &s;ilence. When they came near the enemy, they &s;et up great
cries, &s;trik|ing their darts upon their &s;hields to frighten the hor&s;e;
and then moving all together, they &s;prung forwards upon the barbarians with
all their force, who did not wait their charge, but took to their heels and
fled univer&s;ally, ex|cept Ti&s;&s;aphernes, who &s;tood his ground with a
&s;mall part of his troops.</P>
<P>Cyrus &s;aw with plea&s;ure the enemy routed by the Greeks, and was
proclaimed king by tho&s;e around him: but he did not give him&s;elf up to a
vain joy, nor as yet reckoned him&s;elf victor. He perceived that Artaxerxes
was wheeling his right to attack him in flank, and marched directly again&s;t
him with his &s;ix hun|dred hor&s;e. He killed Artager&s;es, who com|manded the
king's guard of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, with his own hand, and put the whole
body to flight. Di&s;covering his brother, he cried out <PB N="351" REF="356">
with his eyes &s;parkling with rage, I &s;ee him, and &s;purred again&s;t him,
followed only by his principal officers, for his troops had quitted their ranks
to follow the run-aways, which was an e&s;&s;ential fault.</P>
<P>The battle then became a &s;ingle combat in &s;ome mea&s;ure between
Artaxerxes and Cyrus, and the two brothers were &s;een tran&s;ported with rage
and fury, endeavouring like Eteocles and Polynices to plunge their &s;words
into each others hearts, and to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of the throne by the
death of their rival.</P>
<P>Cyrus having opened his way through tho&s;e who were drawn up in
battle before Artaxerxes, joined him, and killed his hor&s;e, that fell with
him to the ground: he ro&s;e, and was re|mounted upon another, when Cyrus
attacked him again, gave him a &s;econd wound, and was preparing to give him a
third, in hopes that it would prove his la&s;t. The king, like a lion wounded
by the hunt&s;man, was only the more furious from the &s;mart, and &s;prung
for|wards, impetuou&s;ly pu&s;hing his hor&s;e again&s;t Cyrus, who running
headlong, and without regard to his per&s;on, threw him&s;elf into the mid&s;t
of a flight of darts aimed at him from all &s;ides, and received a wound from
the king's javelin at the in&s;tant that all the re&s;t di&s;charged 
<PB N="352" REF="357"> upon him. Cyrus fell dead; &s;ome &s;ay by the wound
given him by the king, others affirm that he was killed by a Carian &s;oldier.
The greate&s;t per&s;ons of his court re&s;olving not to &s;urvive &s;o good a
ma&s;ter, were all killed around his body; a certain proof, &s;ays Xenophon,
that he well knew how to chu&s;e his friends, and that he was truly beloved by
them. Ariae|us, who ought to have been the firme&s;t of all his adherents, fled
with the left wing as &s;oon as he heard of his death.</P>
<P>Artaxerxes, after having cau&s;ed the head and right hand of his
brother to be cut off by the eunuch Me&s;abates, pur&s;ued the enemy into their
camp. Ariaeus had not &s;topped there, but having pa&s;&s;ed through it,
continued his retreat to the place where the army had en|camped the day before,
which was about four leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Ti&s;&s;aphernes, after the defeat of the greate&s;t part of his
le&s;t wing by the Greeks, led on the re&s;t again&s;t them, and, by the &s;ide
of the river, pa&s;&s;ed through the light armed infantry of the Greeks, who
opened to give him a pa&s;&s;age, and made their di&s;charges upon him as he
pa&s;&s;|ed, without lo&s;ing a man. They were com|manded by Epi&s;thenes of
Amphipolis, who was e&s;teemed an able captain. Ti&s;&s;aphernes 
<PB N="353" REF="358"> kept on without returning to the charge, be|cau&s;e he
perceived he was too weak, and went forward to Cyrus's camp, where he found the
king, who was plundering it, but had not been able to force the quarter
defended by the Greeks, who &s;aved their baggage.</P>
<P>The Greeks on their &s;ide, and Artaxerxes on his, who did not know
what had pa&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere, believed each of them that they had gained the
victory; the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they had put the enemy to flight, and pur&s;ued
them; and the king, becau&s;e he had killed his brother, beat the troops he had
fought, and plundered their camp. The event was &s;oon cleared up on both
&s;ides. Ti&s;&s;aphernes, upon his arrival at the camp, informed the king,
that the Greeks had defeated his left wing, and pur&s;ued it with great vigour;
and the Greeks, on their &s;ide, learnt, that the king in pur&s;uing Cyrus's
left had penetrated into the camp. Upon this advice the king rallied his
troops, and marched in que&s;t of the enemy; and Clearchus being returned from
pur&s;uing the Per&s;ians, advanced to &s;upport the camp.</P>
<P>The two armies were &s;oon very near each other, when, by a movement
made by the <PB N="354" REF="359"> king, he &s;eemed to intend to charge the
Greeks on their left, who fearing to be &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, wheeled
about and halted, with the river on their backs, to prevent their being taken
in the rear. Upon &s;eeing that, the king changed his form of battle al&s;o,
drew up his army in front of them, and marched on to the attack. As &s;oon as
the Greeks &s;aw him ap|proach, they began to &s;ing the hymn of battle, and
advanced again&s;t the enemy even with more ardour than in the fir&s;t
action.</P>
<P>The barbarians again began to fly, running farther than before, and
were pur&s;ued to a village at the foot of a hill, upon which their hor&s;e
halted. The king's &s;tandard was ob|&s;erved to be there, which was a golden
eagle upon the top of a pike, having its wings di&s;|played. The Greeks
preparing to pur&s;ue them, they abandoned al&s;o the hill, fled pre|cipitately
with all their troops broke, and in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and confu&s;ion.
Clearchus having drawn up the Greeks at the bottom of the hill, ordered Lycias,
the Syracu&s;an, and another, to go up it and ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;ed in the
plain. They returned with an ac|count that the enemies fled on all &s;ides, and
that their whole army was routed.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="360"> As it was almo&s;t night, the Greeks laid
down their arms to re&s;t them&s;elves, much &s;urpri&s;ed that neither Cyrus,
nor any one from him appear|ed; and imagining, that he was either engag|ed in
the pur&s;uit of the enemy, or was making ha&s;te to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of
&s;ome important place, for they were &s;till ignorant of his death, and the
defeat of the re&s;t of his army; they determined, to return to their camp, and
found the greate&s;t part of the baggage taken, with all the provi&s;ions, and
four hun|dred waggons laden with corn and wine, which Cyrus had expre&s;sly
cau&s;ed to be carried along with the army for the Greeks, in ca&s;e of any
pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity. They pa&s;&s;ed the night in the camp, the
greate&s;t part of them without any refre&s;hment, concluding that Cyrus was
alive and victorious.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the confu&s;ion the Grecians were in after the battle, they
&s;ent to Ariaeus, as con|queror and commander in chief, upon Cyrus's death, to
offer him the Per&s;ian crown. In the mean time, the king, as conqueror, al&s;o
on his &s;ide, &s;ent to them to &s;urrender their arms, and implore his mercy,
repre&s;enting to them, at the &s;ame time, that as they were in the heart of
his dominions, &s;urrounded with va&s;t rivers, and numberle&s;s nations, it
would <PB N="356" REF="361"> be impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape his
venge|ance; and, therefore, they had nothing to do but to &s;ubmit to the
pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. Upon debating among them&s;elves what an&s;wer they
&s;hould return, Proxenus de&s;ired to know of the heralds upon what terms the
king demand|ed their arms: if, as conqueror, it was in his power to take them;
if upon any other footing, what would he give them in return. He was &s;econded
by Xenophon, who &s;aid, they had nothing left but their arms and their
liberty, and that they could not pre&s;erve the one with|out the other.
Clearchus &s;aid to the &s;ame effect, that if the king was di&s;po&s;ed to be
their friend, they &s;hould be in a better capa|city of &s;erving him with arms
than without; if their enemy, they &s;hould have need of them for their
defence. Some indeed &s;poke in terms more complying; that as they had &s;erved
Cy|rus faithfully, they would al&s;o &s;erve Artaxerxes, if he would employ
them, and provided he would, at the &s;ame time, put them in
po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Egypt. At la&s;t it was agreed, they &s;hould remain in
the place where they were; and that if they advanced farther, or retreated
back, it &s;hould be looked upon as a declara|tion of war: &s;o that by the
i&s;&s;ue of the debate, it appeared to have been managed &s;o as to 
<PB N="357" REF="362"> avoid giving a direct an&s;wer, but only to amu&s;e the
king and gain time.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this treaty was on foot, they receiv|ed Ariaeus's an&s;wer,
that there were too many powerful men in Per&s;ia to let him po&s;&s;e&s;s the
throne; wherefore he intended to &s;et out early the next morning on his return
to Greece; and that, if they had a mind to accompany him, they &s;hould join
him that night in his camp: which accordingly they all did, except
Mil|thocytus, a Thracian, who went with a party of three hundred men and forty
hor&s;e to the king. The re&s;t, in conjunction with Ariaeus's forces, decamped
by break of day, and con|tinued their march until &s;un-&s;et, when they
di&s;covered from the neighbouring villages that the king was in pur&s;uit of
them.</P>
<P>Clearchus, who now undertook to conduct the Greeks, ordered his
troops to halt, and prepared for an engagement. The king of Per|&s;ia terrified
by &s;o bold an appearance, &s;ent he|ralds not to demand their &s;urrender,
but to propo&s;e terms of peace and treaty. When Clearchus was informed of
their arrival, he gave orders to bid them wait, and to tell them that he was
not yet at lei&s;ure to hear them. He a&s;&s;umed purpo&s;ely an air of
haughtine&s;s and <PB N="358" REF="363"> grandeur, to denote his intrepidity,
and, at the &s;ame time, to &s;hew the fine appearance and good condition of
his phalanx. When he advanced with the mo&s;t &s;hewy of his officers,
expre&s;sly cho&s;en for the occa&s;ion, and had heard what the heralds had to
propo&s;e; he made an&s;wer, that they mu&s;t begin with giv|ing battle,
becau&s;e the army being in want of provi&s;ions had no time to lo&s;e. The
heralds having carried back this an&s;wer to their ma&s;ter, returned
immediately, which &s;hewed that the king, or whoever &s;poke in his name, was
not very far di&s;tant. They &s;aid they had orders to conduct them to villages
where they would find provi&s;ions in abundance, and conducted them thither
accordingly.</P>
<P>After three days &s;tay Ti&s;&s;aphernes arrived from the king, and
in&s;inuated to them the good offices he had employed for their &s;afety.
Clearchus in his own defence urged, that they were engaged in this expedition
without know|ing the enemy again&s;t whom they were to con|tend; that they were
free from all engage|ments, and had no de&s;ign again&s;t the Per&s;ian king,
unle&s;s he oppo&s;ed their return. Ti&s;&s;a|phernes &s;eemingly granted their
de&s;ire, and promi&s;ed that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with all 
<PB N="359" REF="364"> nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions in their march; and to
confirm their &s;ecurity, that he him&s;elf would be their companion on the
way.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in a few days after they &s;et out under his conduct;
but, in their march, the barbarians encamping at about a league's di&s;tance
from the Grecians, created &s;ome little di&s;tru&s;ts and jealou&s;ies on both
&s;ides. In about fifty days, being got to the banks of the river Zabatus,
Clearchus, to prevent things coming to an open rupture, had a conference with
Ti&s;&s;aphernes. The re&s;ult of their di&s;cour&s;e was, that they had been
mi&s;repre&s;ented to each other by &s;ome of Clearchus's officers; and that he
&s;hould bring them all to Ti&s;&s;aphernes, in order to detect tho&s;e who
were guilty. In con|&s;equence of this, it was agreed between them that there
&s;hould be a general con&s;ultation of officers, in which tho&s;e who had been
remi&s;s, or attempted to &s;ow any di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the two armies,
&s;hould be expo&s;ed and puni&s;h|ed. Menon, in particular, was &s;u&s;pected
on both &s;ides, and he was appointed among the number. In con&s;equence of
this fatal re&s;olu|tion, the five principal generals attended the &s;ucceeding
day at the Per&s;ian general's tent. Their names were, Clearchus, Menon,
Prox|enes, Agias, and Socrates; they, on a &s;ignal <PB N="360" REF="365">
given, were immediately &s;eized, their attend|ants put to the &s;word, and
them&s;elves, after being &s;ent bound to the king, were beheaded in his
pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the con&s;ternation of the Greeks when they
were informed of the ma&s;&s;acre of their generals: they were now near two
thou&s;and miles from home, &s;urrounded with great rivers, exten&s;ive
de&s;arts, and inimical nations, without any &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. In
this &s;tate of general dejection, they could think of taking neither
nouri&s;hment nor repo&s;e; all now turned their eyes upon Xenophon, a young
Athenian, who had been invited into A&s;ia by Proxences, and had hitherto
&s;erved as a volun|teer in the army: this was that Xenophon af|terwards &s;o
famous as an hi&s;torian; and his conduct &s;eemed equal to his eloquence, in
which he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t of mankind. This young general went to
&s;ome of the Greek officers in the middle of the night, and repre|&s;ented to
them that they had no time to lo&s;e; that it was of the la&s;t importance to
prevent the bad de&s;igns of the enemy; that, however &s;mall their number,
they would render them&s;elves formidable, if they behaved with boldne&s;s and
re&s;olution; that valour, and not multitudes, determines the &s;ucce&s;s of
arms; and that it <PB N="361" REF="366"> was nece&s;&s;ary, above all things,
to nominate generals immediately, becau&s;e an army with|out commanders is like
a body without a &s;oul. A council was immediately held, at which an hundred
officers were pre&s;ent; and Xenophon being de&s;ired to &s;peak, deduced the
rea&s;ons at large he had at fir&s;t but lightly touched upon: and, by his
advice, commanders were appoint|ed. They were, Tima&s;ion for Clearchus,
Xan|thicles for Socrates, Cleanor for Agis, Phile|&s;ius for Menon, and
Xenophon for Proxenes.</P>
<P>Before the break of day they a&s;&s;embled the army. The generals
made &s;peeches to animate the troops; and Xenophon, among the re&s;t. 
<Q REND="inline">"Fellow-&s;oldiers, &s;aid he, the lo&s;s of &s;o
many brave men by vile treachery, and the being abandoned by our friends, is
very deplorable; but we mu&s;t not &s;ink under our misfortunes: and, if we
cannot conquer, let us chu&s;e rather to peri&s;h gloriou&s;ly than to fall
into the hands of barbarians, who would inflict upon us the greate&s;t
mi&s;eries; let us call to mind the glori|ous battles of Plataea, Thermopylae,
Salamis, and the many others wherein our ance&s;tors, though with a &s;mall
number, have fought and defeated the innumerable armies of the Per|&s;ians, and
thereby rendered the name alone of Greeks for ever formidable. It is to their 
<PB N="362" REF="367"> invincible valour we owe the honour we po&s;&s;e&s;s of
acknowledging no ma&s;ters upon earth but the gods, nor any happine&s;s but
what con&s;i&s;ts with liberty. Tho&s;e gods, the avengers of perjury, and
witne&s;&s;es of the enemy's trea&s;on, will be favourable to us; and, as they
are at|tacked in the violation of treaties, and take plea&s;ure in humbling the
proud, and exalting the low, they will al&s;o follow us to battle and combat
for us. For the re&s;t, fellow-&s;oldiers, as we have no refuge but in victory,
which mu&s;t be our hope, and will make us ample amends for whatever it co&s;ts
to attain it; I &s;hould be|lieve, if it were your opinion, that for the making
a more ready and le&s;s difficult retreat, it would be very proper to rid
our&s;elves of all the u&s;ele&s;s baggage, and to keep only what is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in our march."</Q> All the &s;oldiers that moment
lifted up their hands, to &s;ignify their approbation and con&s;ent to all that
had been &s;aid, and without lo&s;s of time &s;et fire to their tents and
carriages; &s;uch of them as had too much equipage, giving it others who had
too little, and de&s;troying the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Cheri&s;ophus, the Spartan general, led the van, and Xenophon, with
Tyma&s;ion, brought up the rear. They bent their march towards 
<PB N="363" REF="368"> the heads of the great rivers, in order to pa&s;s them
where they were fordable. But they had made little way before they were
followed by a party of the enemy's archers and &s;lingers, commanded by
Mithridates, which galled their rear, and wounded &s;everal of them, who be|ing
heavy armed, and without cavalry, could make no re&s;i&s;tance. To prevent the
like in|convenience, Xenophon furni&s;hed two hundred Rhodians with &s;lings,
and mounted fifty more of his men upon baggage-hor&s;es; &s;o that when
Mithridates came up with them a &s;econd time, and with a much greater body, he
repul&s;ed them with lo&s;s, and made good his retreat with this handful of
men, until he arrived near the city of Lari&s;&s;a, on the banks of the Tigris.
From thence they marched to another de&s;olate city, called Mep&s;ila, and
about four leagues from that place Ti&s;&s;aphernes came up to them with his
whole army in order of battle, but after &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes was forced to
retire. In a few days after he &s;ecured an eminence over which the Grecians
were obliged to make their way, which Xenophon perceiving, took a detachment of
the army, and with great dili|gence gained the top of a mountain which
commanded that eminence, from whence he <PB N="364" REF="369"> ea&s;ily
di&s;lodged the enemy, and made good a pa&s;&s;age for the re&s;t of his troops
into the plain, where they found plenty of provi&s;ions, though
Ti&s;&s;aphernes had done what he could before to burn and de&s;troy the
country.</P>
<P>But &s;till they were under as great difficulties as ever, being
bounded on the one hand by the Tigris, and on the other by inacce&s;&s;ible
mountains, inhabited by the Carduch, a fierce and warlike people; and who,
Xenophon &s;ays, had cut off an army of &s;ix &s;core thou&s;and Per&s;ians to
a man, by rea&s;on of the difficulty of the ways. However, having no boats to
cro&s;s the river, and the pa&s;&s;age through the mountains opening into the
rich plains of Ar|menia, they re&s;olved to pur&s;ue their march that way.
The&s;e barbarians &s;oon took the alarm, but not being prepared to meet the
Greeks in a body, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the tops of the rocks
and mountains, and from thence annoyed them with darts and great &s;tones,
which they threw down into the de&s;iles through which they pa&s;&s;ed, in
which they were al&s;o attacked by &s;everal other parties; and though their
lo&s;s was not con&s;iderable, yet, what with &s;torms and famine, be&s;ides
&s;even tedious days march, and being continually forced to fight their 
<PB N="365" REF="370"> way, they underwent more fatigue and hard|&s;hip than
they had &s;uffered from the Per&s;ians during the whole expedition.</P>
<P>They found them&s;elves &s;oon after expo&s;ed to new dangers.
Almo&s;t at the foot of the mountains, they came to a river two hundred feet in
breadth, called Centrites, which &s;top|ped their march. They had to defend
them|&s;elves again&s;t the enemy, who pur&s;ued them in the rear, and the
Armenians, the &s;oldiers of the country, who defended the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of
the river. They attempted in vain to pa&s;s it in a place where the water came
up to their arm pits, and were carried away by the rapidity of the current,
again&s;t which the weight of their arms made them unable to re|&s;i&s;t. By
good fortune they di&s;covered another place not &s;o deep, where &s;ome
&s;oldiers had &s;een the people of the country pa&s;s. It required abundance
of addre&s;s, diligence, and valour, to keep off the enemy on both &s;ides of
them. The army, however, pa&s;&s;ed the river at length without much
lo&s;s.</P>
<P>They marched forwards with le&s;s interrup|tion, pa&s;&s;ed the
&s;ource of the Tygris, and ar|rived at the little river Teleboa, which is very
beautiful, and has many villages on its banks. Here began the we&s;tern
Armenia, which was <PB N="366" REF="371"> governed by Tiriba&s;us, a &s;atrap
much beloved by the king, and who had the honour to help him to mount on
hor&s;eback when at the court. He offered to let the army pa&s;s, and to
&s;uffer the &s;oldiers to take all they wanted, upon condi|tion that they
&s;hould commit no ravages in their march; which propo&s;al was accepted and
ratified on each &s;ide. Tiriba&s;us kept always a flying camp at a &s;mall
di&s;tance from the army. There fell a great quantity of &s;now, which gave the
troops &s;ome inconvenience; and they learnt from a pri&s;oner, that
Tiriba&s;us had a de|&s;ign to attack the Greeks at a pa&s;s of the mountains,
in a defile through which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily march. They prevented
him, by &s;eizing that po&s;t, after having put the enemy to flight. After
&s;ome days march through the de&s;art, they pa&s;&s;ed the Euphrates near its
&s;ource, not having the water above their middles.</P>
<P>They &s;uffered exceedingly afterwards from a north wind, which blew
in their faces, and prevented re&s;piration; &s;o that it was thought
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice to the wind, upon which it &s;eemed to abate. They
marched on in &s;now five or &s;ix feet deep, which killed &s;everal
&s;er|vants and bea&s;ts of burden, be&s;ides thirty &s;ol|diers. They made
fires during the night, for <PB N="367" REF="372"> they found plenty of wood.
All the next day they continued their march through the &s;now, when many of
them, from the exce&s;s of hun|ger, followed with languor, or fainting,
con|tinued lying upon the ground through weak|ne&s;s and want of &s;pirits:
when &s;omething had been given them to eat, they found them|&s;elves relived,
and continued their march.</P>
<P>After a march of &s;even days they arrived at the river Araxes,
called al&s;o the Pha&s;us, which is about an hundred feet in breadth. Two days
after they di&s;covered the Pha&s;ians, the Cha|lybes, and the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ochians, who kept the pa&s;s of the
mountain to prevent their de&s;cending in|to the plain. They &s;aw it was
impo&s;&s;ible to avoid coming to a battle with them, and re|&s;olved to give
it the &s;ame day. Xenophon, who had ob&s;erved that the enemy defended on|ly
the ordinary pa&s;&s;age, and that the mountain was three leagues in extent,
propo&s;ed the &s;end|ing a detachment to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
heights that commanded the enemy, which would not be difficult, as they might
prevent all &s;u&s;picion of their de&s;ign by a march in the night, and by
making a fal&s;e attack by the main road to amu&s;e the barbarians. This was
accordingly executed, the enemy put to &s;light, and the pa&s;s cleared. Thus,
after twelve or <PB N="368" REF="373"> fifteen days march, they arrived at a
very high mountain, called Tecqua, from whence they de&s;cried the &s;ea. The
fir&s;t who perceived it rai&s;ed great &s;houts of joy for a con&s;iderable
time, which made Xenophon imagine that the vanguard was attacked, and went with
all ha&s;te to &s;upport it. As he approached nearer, the cry of the &s;ea! the
&s;ea! was heard di&s;tinctly, and the alarm changed into joy and gaiety; and
when they came to the top, nothing was heard but a confu&s;ed noi&s;e of the
whole army, crying out together, the &s;ea! the &s;ea! whil&s;t they could not
refrain from tears, nor from embracing their generals and officers; and then,
without waiting for orders, they heaped up a pile of &s;tones, and erected a
trophy with broken bucklers and other arms.</P>
<P>From thence they advanced to the moun|tains of Colchis, one of which
was higher than the re&s;t, and of that the people of the country had
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves. The Greeks drew up in battle at the bottom of
it to a&s;cend, for the acce&s;s was not impracticable. Xenophon did not judge
it proper to march in line of battle, but by files, becau&s;e the &s;oldiers
could not keep their ranks from the inequality of the ground, that in &s;ome
places were ea&s;y, in others difficult to climb, which might di&s;courage 
<PB N="369" REF="374"> them. That advice was approved, and the army formed
according to it. The heavy|armed troops amounted to four&s;core files, each
con&s;i&s;ting of about one hundred men; with eighteen hundred light-armed
&s;oldiers, divided in three bodies, one of which was po&s;ted on the right,
another on the left, and a third in the center. After having encouraged his
troops, by repre&s;enting to them that this was the la&s;t ob&s;tacle they had
to &s;urmount, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the gods, the army began to
a&s;cend the hill. The enemy were not able to &s;upport their charge, and
di&s;per&s;ed. They pa&s;&s;ed the mountain, and encamped in villages, where
they found provi&s;ions in abund|ance.</P>
<P>A very &s;trange accident happened there to the army, which put them
into great con&s;terna|tion; for the &s;oldiers finding abundance of bee|hives
in that place, and eating the honey, they were taken with violent vomiting and
fluxes, attended with raving fits; &s;o that tho&s;e who were lea&s;t ill
&s;eemed like drunken men, and the re&s;t either furiou&s;ly mad or dying. The
earth was &s;trewed with their bodies as after a defeat; however, none of them
died, and the di&s;temper cea&s;ed the next day, about the &s;ame hour it had
taken them. The third or fourth <PB N="370" REF="375"> day the &s;oldiers got
up, but in the condition people are in after taking a violent medicine.</P>
<P>Two days after the army arrived near Tre|bi&s;ond, a Greek colony of
Sinopians, &s;ituated upon the Euxine, or Black Sea, in the pro|vince of
Colchis. Here they lay encamped for thirty days, and acquitted them&s;elves of
the vows they had made to Jupiter, Hercules, and the other deities, to obtain
an happy re|turn into their own country: they al&s;o cele|brated the games of
hor&s;e and foot races, wre&s;tling, boxing, the pancratium, the whole attended
with the greate&s;t joy and &s;olemnity. Here Xenophon formed a project of
&s;ettling them in tho&s;e parts, and founding a Grecian colony, which was
approved of by &s;ome; but his enemies repre&s;enting it to the army only as a
more honourable way of abandoning them; and to the inhabitants as a de&s;ign to
&s;ubdue and en&s;lave the country, he was forced to give over that enterprize.
However, the noi&s;e of it had this good effect, that the natives did what they
could in a friendly manner to pro|cure their departure, advi&s;ing them to go
by &s;ea as the &s;afe&s;t way, and furni&s;hed them with a &s;ufficient number
of tran&s;ports for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="376"> Accordingly they embarked with a fair wind,
and the next day got into the harbour of Sinope, where Cheri&s;ophus met them
with &s;ome gallies; but in&s;tead of the money they had al&s;o expected from
him, he only told them they &s;hould be paid their arrears as &s;oon as they
got out of the Euxine &s;ea. But this an&s;wer occa&s;ioned a great deal of
murmuring and di&s;content among them; &s;o that they re|&s;olved to put
them&s;elves under one general, de&s;iring Xenophon in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
and af|fectionate terms to accept of that command, which he mode&s;tly
declined, and procured the choice to fall upon Cheri&s;ophus. But he en|joyed
it not above &s;ix or &s;even days; for no &s;ooner were they arrived at
Heraclea, than the army depo&s;ed him for refu&s;ing to extort a &s;um of money
from the inhabitants of that city; which being a Grecian colony, Xenophon
likewi&s;e refu&s;ed to concern him&s;elf in that af|fair; &s;o that the army
being di&s;appointed in their hopes of plunder, fell into a mutiny, and divided
into three bodies, after &s;uffering a &s;light retreat. When divided from
their bar|barian enemies, they were happily reunited and encamped at the port
of Calpe, where they &s;et|tled the command as before, &s;ub&s;tituting Neon in
the room of Cheri&s;ophus, who died here, <PB N="372" REF="377"> and making it
death for any man hencefor|ward to propo&s;e the dividing of the army. But
being &s;treightened for provi&s;ions, they were forced to &s;pread
them&s;elves in the vallies, where Pharnabazus's hor&s;e, being joined by the
inhabitants, cut in pieces five hundred of them; the re&s;t e&s;caping to a
hill, were re&s;cued and brought off by Xenophon, who after this led them
through a large fore&s;t, where Pharna|bazus had po&s;ted his troops to
oppo&s;e their pa&s;&s;age; but they entirely defeated him, and pur&s;ued their
march to Chry&s;opolis of Chal|cedon, having got a great deal of booty in their
way, and from thence to Byzantium.</P>
<P>From thence he led them to Salmyde&s;&s;a, to &s;erve Seuthes prince
of Thrace, who had be|force &s;ollicited Xenophon by his envoys to bring troops
to his aid, in order to his re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in his father's dominions, of
which his enemies had deprived him. He had made Xenophon great promi&s;es for
him&s;elf and his troops; but when he had done him the &s;ervice he wanted, he
was &s;o far from keeping his word, that he did not give them the pay agreed
upon. Xenophon reproached him exceeding|ly with this breach of faith, imputing
his per|fidy to his mini&s;ter Heraclides, who thought to make his court to his
ma&s;ter by &s;aving him <PB N="373" REF="378"> a &s;um of money at the expence
of ju&s;tice, faith, and hone&s;ty, qualities which ought to be dearer than all
others to a prince, as they contribute the mo&s;t to his reputation, as well as
to the &s;ucce&s;s of affairs, and the &s;ecurity of a &s;tate. But that
treacherous mini&s;ter, who looked upon honour, probity, and ju&s;tice as mere
chimeras; and that there was nothing real but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of much
money, had no thoughts, in con&s;equence, but of enriching him&s;elf by any
means what&s;oever, and robbed his ma&s;ter fir&s;t with impunity, and all his
&s;ub|jects along with him. However, continued Xenophon, every wi&s;e man,
e&s;pecially in au|thority and command, ought to regard ju&s;|tice, probity,
and the faith of engagements as the mo&s;t precious trea&s;ure he can
po&s;&s;e&s;s, and as an a&s;&s;ured re&s;ource and an infallible &s;upport in
all the events that can happen. Heraclides was the more in the wrong for acting
in this manner with regard to the troops, as he was a native of Greece, and not
a Thracian; but avarice had extingui&s;hed all &s;en&s;e of honour in him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the di&s;pute between Seuthes and Xenophon was warme&s;t,
Charminus and Poly|nices arrived as amba&s;&s;adors from Lacedae|mon, and
brought advice, that the republic <PB N="374" REF="379"> had declared war
again&s;t Ti&s;&s;aphernes and Pharnabazus; that Thimbron had already embarked
with the troops, and promi&s;ed a darick a month to every &s;oldier, two to
each officer, and four to the colonels, who &s;hould engage in the &s;ervice.
Xenophon accepted the offer, and having obtained from Seuthes, by the mediation
of the amba&s;&s;adors, part of the pay due to him, he went by &s;ea to
Lamp|&s;acus with the army, which amounted at that time to almo&s;t &s;ix
thou&s;and men. From thence he advanced to Pergamus, a city in the pro|vince of
Troas. Having met near Parthenia, where ended the expedition of the Greeks, a
great nobleman returning into Per&s;ia, he took him, his wife and children,
with all his equipage, and by that means found him&s;elf in a condi|tion to
be&s;tow great liberalities among&s;t the &s;oldiers, and to make them a
&s;atisfactory a|mends for all the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained. Thimbron
at length arrived, who took upon him the command of the troops, and having
joined them with his own, marched again&s;t Ti&s;|&s;aphernes and
Pharnabazus.</P>
<P>Such was the event of Cyrus's expedition. Xenophon reckons from the
fir&s;t &s;etting out of that prince's army from the city of Ephe&s;us to their
arrival where the battle was fought, <PB N="375" REF="380"> five hundred and
thirty para&s;angas, or leagues, and four&s;core and thirteen days march; and
in their return from the place of battle to Cotyora, a city upon the coa&s;t of
the Euxine, or Black Sea, &s;ix hundred and twenty para&s;angas, or leagues,
and one hundred and twenty days march; and, adding both together, he &s;ays the
way going and coming was eleven hundred and fifty-five para&s;angas, or
leagues, and two hundred and fifteen days march; and that the whole time the
army took to perform that journey, including the days of re&s;t, was fifteen
months.</P>
<P>This retreat of the ten thou&s;and Greeks has always pa&s;&s;ed
among judges of the art of war as a mo&s;t extraordinary undertaking, and it,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in&s;pired them ever after with a contempt for the power
of the Per&s;ians; it taught them, that their dominions could be invaded
without danger, and that marching into Per|&s;ia was but pur&s;uing an
unre&s;i&s;ting enemy, that only appeared to offer victory rather than
battle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Greece was gaining fame in Per&s;ia, Athens
was lo&s;ing its honour at home: though it had now &s;ome breathing|time to
recover from its late confu&s;ions, yet &s;till there were the &s;eeds of
rancour remaining, <PB N="376" REF="381"> and the citizens oppo&s;ed each other
with unre|mitting malice. Socrates was the fir&s;t object that fell a
&s;acrifice to the&s;e popular di&s;&s;en|&s;ions. We have already &s;een this
great man, who was the &s;on of an ob&s;cure citizen at Athens, emerging from
the meanne&s;s of his birth, and giving examples of courage, moderation, and
wi&s;dom; we have &s;een him &s;aving the life of Alcibiades in battle, of
refu&s;ing to concur in the edict which unju&s;tly doomed the &s;ix Athenian
generals to death, of with&s;tanding the thirty tyrants, and of &s;purning the
bigotry and per&s;ecution of the times with the mo&s;t acute penetration, and
the mo&s;t cau&s;tic raillery; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed unexampled good-nature, and
an univer&s;al love to mankind; he was ready to pity vices in others, while he
was in a great mea&s;ure free from them him&s;elf; however, he knew his own
defects, and if he was proud of any thing, it was in the being thought to have
none. He &s;eemed, &s;ays Libanius, the common father of the republic, &s;o
attentive was he to the happine&s;s and advantage of his whole country. But as
it is very difficult to correct the aged, and to make people change principles,
who revere the errors in which they have grown grey, he devoted his labours
principally to the in&s;truction of youth, in or|der <PB N="377" REF="382"> to
&s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue in a &s;oil more fit to produce the fruits of it.
He had no open &s;chool like the re&s;t of the philo&s;ophers, nor &s;et times
for his le&s;&s;ons; he had no benches pre|pared, nor ever mounted a
profe&s;&s;or's chair; he was the philo&s;opher of all times and &s;ea|&s;ons;
he taught in all places, and upon all oc|ca&s;ions, in walking, conver&s;ation
at meals, in the army, and in the mid&s;t of the camp, in the public
a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;enate or people. Such was the man whom a faction in
the city had long devoted to de&s;truction; he had been for many years before
his death the object of their &s;atire and ridicule. Ari&s;tophanes, the comic
poet, was engaged to expo&s;e him upon the &s;tage: he compo&s;ed a piece
called the Clouds, wherein he introduced the philo&s;opher in a ba&s;ket,
uttering the mo&s;t ridiculous ab|&s;urdities. Socrates, who was pre&s;ent at
the exhibition of his own character, &s;eemed not to feel the lea&s;t emotion;
and, as &s;ome &s;trangers were pre&s;ent who de&s;ired to know the original
for whom the play was intended, he ro&s;e up from his &s;eat, and &s;hewed
him&s;elf during the whole repre&s;entation. This was the fir&s;t blow &s;truck
at him, and it was not till twenty years after that Melitus appeared in a more
formal man|ner as his accu&s;er, and entered a regular pro|ce&s;s 
<PB N="378" REF="383"> again&s;t him. His accu&s;ation con&s;i&s;ted of two
heads; the fir&s;t was, that he did not ad|mit the gods acknowledged by the
republic, and introduced new divinities: the &s;econd, that he corrupted the
youth of Athens; and concluded with inferring that &s;entence of death ought to
pa&s;s again&s;t him. How far the whole charge affected him is not ea&s;y to
de|termine: it is certain, that amid&s;t &s;o much zeal and &s;uper&s;tition as
then reigned in Athens, he never dur&s;t openly oppo&s;e the received
re|ligion, and was therefore &s;orced to pre&s;erve an outward &s;hew of it;
but it is very pro|bable, from the di&s;cour&s;es he frequently held with his
friends, that in his heart he de&s;pi&s;ed and laughed at their mon&s;trous
opinions and ridiculous my&s;teries, as having no other foun|dation than the
fables of the poets; and that he had attained to the notion of the one only
true God, in&s;omuch, that upon the account both of his belief of the Deity,
and the ex|emplarine&s;s of his life, &s;ome have thought fit to rank him with
the Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the con&s;piracy broke out, the friends of Socrates
prepared for his defence. Lycias, the mu&s;t able orator of his time, brought
him an elaborate di&s;cour&s;e of his compo&s;ing, wherein he had &s;et forth
the rea|&s;ons <PB N="379" REF="384"> and mea&s;ures of Socrates in their full
force, and inter&s;pered the whole with tender and pathetic &s;trokes, capable
of moving the mo&s;t obdurate hearts. Socrates read it with plea&s;ure, and
approved it very much; but, as it was more conformable to the rules of
rhe|toric, than the &s;entiments and fortitude of a philo&s;opher, he told him
frankly, that it did not &s;uit him. Upon which Lycias having a&s;ked how it
was po&s;&s;ible to be well done, and at the &s;ame time not &s;uit him? In the
&s;ame manner, &s;aid he, u&s;ing according to his cu&s;|tom a vulgar
compari&s;on, that an excellent workman might bring me magnificent apparel, or
&s;hoes embroidered with gold, to which no|thing would be wanting on his part,
but which, however, would not fit me. He per|&s;i&s;ted, therefore, inflexibly
in the re&s;olution not to demean him&s;elf by begging &s;uffrages in the low
abject manner common at that time. He employed neither artifice nor the glitter
of eloquence; he had no recour&s;e either to &s;ollici|tation or entreaty; he
brought neither his wife nor children to incline the judges in his favour by
their &s;ighs and tears: neverthele&s;s, though he firmly refu&s;ed to make
u&s;e of any other voice but his own in his defence, and to appear before his
judges in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive po&s;|ture <PB N="380" REF="385"> of a
&s;uppliant, he did not behave in that manner out of pride or contempt of the
tri|bunal; it was from a noble and intrepid a&s;|&s;urance, re&s;ulting from
greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his truth and innocence;
&s;o that his defence had nothing timorous or weak in it: his di&s;cour&s;e was
bold, manly, ge|nerous, without pa&s;&s;ion, without emotion, full of the noble
liberty of a philo&s;opher, with no other ornament than that of truth, and
brightened univer&s;ally with the character and language of innocence. Plato,
who was pre|&s;ent, tran&s;cribed it afterwards, and without any additions,
compo&s;ed from it the work which he calls the Apology of Socrates, one of the
mo&s;t con&s;ummate ma&s;ter-pieces of antiquity. I &s;hall here make an
extract from it.</P>
<P>Upon the day a&s;&s;igned, the proceedings commenced in the u&s;ual
forms; the parties appeared before the judges, and Melitus &s;poke: the wor&s;e
his cau&s;e, and the le&s;s pro|vided it was with proofs, the more occa&s;ion
he had for addre&s;s and art to cover its weak|ne&s;s; he omitted nothing that
might render the adver&s;e party odious; and, in&s;tead of rea|&s;ons which
could not but fail him, he &s;ub&s;ti|tuted the delu&s;ive &s;hine of a lively
and pom|pous eloquence. Socrates, in ob&s;erving, that <PB N="381" REF="386">
he could not tell what impre&s;&s;ion the di&s;cour&s;e of his accu&s;ers might
make upon the judges, owns, that for his part, he &s;carce knew him|&s;elf,
they had given &s;uch artful colouring and likelihood to their arguments,
though there was not the lea&s;t word of truth in all they had advanced.</P>
<Q><P>I am accu&s;ed of corrupting the youth, and of in&s;tilling
dangerous maxims into them, as well in regard to the wor&s;hip of the gods as
the rules of government. You know, Athe|nians, that I never made it my
profe&s;&s;ion to teach, nor can envy, however violent again&s;t me, reproach
me with having ever &s;old my in|&s;tructions. I have an undeniable evidence
for me in this re&s;pect, which is my poverty. Al|ways equally ready to
communicate my thoughts either to the rich or poor, and to give them entire
lei&s;ure to que&s;tion or an&s;wer me. I lend my&s;elf to every one who is
de&s;ir|ous of becoming virtuous; and if, among&s;t tho&s;e who hear me, there
are any that prove either good or bad, neither the virtues of the one, nor the
vices of the other, to which I have not contributed, are to be a&s;cribed to
me. My whole employment is to per&s;uade the young and old again&s;t too much
love for the body, for riches, and all other precarious 
<PB N="382" REF="387" MS="y"> things, of what&s;oever nature they be; and
again&s;t too little regard for the &s;oul, which ought to be the object of
their affection. For I ince&s;&s;antly urge to you, that virtue does not
proceed from riches; but, on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that the all
other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their &s;ource in
the &s;ame principle.</P> 
<P>If to &s;peak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confe&s;s,
Athenians, that I am guilty, and de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed. If what I &s;ay be
not true, it is mo&s;t ea&s;y to convict me of my fal&s;hood. I &s;ee here a
great number of my di&s;ciples; they have only to appear. But, per|haps, the
re&s;erve and con&s;ideration for a ma&s;ter who has in&s;tructed them, will
prevent them from declaring again&s;t me; at lea&s;t their fa|thers, brothers,
and uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, di&s;pen&s;e with their
not &s;tanding forth to demand vengeance again&s;t the corrupter of their
&s;ons, brothers, and nephews. But the&s;e are the per&s;ons who take upon them
my defence, and intere&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s of my cau&s;e.</P> 
<P>Pa&s;s on me what &s;entence you plea&s;e, Athenians; but I can
neither repent or change my conduct; I mu&s;t not abandon or &s;u&s;pend a
function which God him&s;elf has impo&s;ed on <PB N="383" REF="388"> me. Now he
has charged me with the care of in&s;tructing my fellow-citizens. If after
having faithfully kept all the po&s;ts wherein I was placed by our generals at
Potidaea, Am|phipolis, and Delium, the fear of death &s;hould at this time make
me abandon that in which the divine Providence has placed me, by com|manding me
to pa&s;s my life in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy for the in&s;truction of
my&s;elf and others; this would be a mo&s;t criminal de&s;er|tion indeed, and
make me highly worthy of be|ing cited before this tribunal as an impious man
who does not believe the gods. Should you re&s;olve to acquit me; for the
future, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to make an&s;wer, Athenians, I honour and
love you; but I &s;hall chu&s;e rather to obey God than you, and to my late&s;t
breath &s;hall never renounce my philo|&s;ophy, nor cea&s;e to exhort and
reprove you according to my cu&s;tom, by telling each of you when you come in
my way, My good friend and citizen of the mo&s;t famous city in the world for
wi&s;dom and valour, are you not a&s;hamed to have no other thoughts than that
of ama&s;&s;ing wealth and of acquiring glory, credit, and dignities, whil&s;t
you neglect the trea&s;ures of prudence, truth, and wi&s;dom, and 
<PB N="384" REF="389"> take no pains in rendering your &s;oul as good and
perfect as it is capable of being.</P> 
<P>I am reproached with abject fear and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, for
being &s;o bu&s;y in im|parting my advice to every one in private, and for
having always avoided to be pre&s;ent in your a&s;&s;emblies to give my
coun&s;els to my country. I think I have &s;ufficiently proved my courage and
fortitude both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the
&s;enate, where I alone oppo&s;ed the unju&s;t &s;en|tence you pronounced
again&s;t the ten captains, who had not taken up and interred the bodies of
tho&s;e who were killed and drowned in the &s;ea-fight near the i&s;land
Arginu&s;ae; and when, upon more than one occa&s;ion, I oppo&s;ed the violent
and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants. What is it then that has prevented me
from appearing in your a&s;&s;emblies? It is that dae|mon, that voice divine,
which you have &s;o often heard me mention, and Melitus has taken &s;o much
pains to ridicule. That &s;pirit has attached it&s;elf to me from my infancy:
it is a voice which I never hear but when it would prevent me from
per&s;i&s;ting in &s;omething I have re&s;olved; for it never exhorts me to
undertake any thing: it is the &s;ame being that <PB N="385" REF="390"> has
always oppo&s;ed me when I would have intermeddled in the affairs of the
republic, and that with the greate&s;t rea&s;on; for I &s;hould have been
among&s;t the dead long ago had I been concerned in the mea&s;ures of the
&s;tate, without effecting any thing to the advantage of my&s;elf or our
country. Do not take it ill, I be&s;eech you, if I &s;peak my thoughts without
di&s;gui&s;e, and with truth and freedom. Every man who would generou&s;ly
oppo&s;e a whole people, either among&s;t us or el&s;ewhere, and who inflexibly
applies him&s;elf to prevent the violation of the laws, and the practice of
ini|quity in a government, will never do &s;o long with impunity. It is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him, who would contend for ju&s;tice, if he has
any thoughts of living, to remain in a private &s;tation, and never to have any
&s;hare in public affairs.</P> 
<P>For the re&s;t, Athenians, if, in the ex|treme danger I now am, I do
not imitate the behaviour of tho&s;e, who upon le&s;s emergencies have implored
and &s;upplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their
chil|dren, relations, and friends; it is not through pride and ob&s;tinacy, or
any contempt for you, but &s;olely for your honour, and for that of the whole
city. You &s;hould know, that there are <PB N="386" REF="391"> among&s;t our
citizens tho&s;e who do not regard death as an evil, and who give that name
on|ly to inju&s;tice and infamy. At my age, and with the reputation, true or
fal&s;e, which I have, would it be con&s;i&s;tent for me, after all the
le&s;&s;ons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it
my&s;elf, and to belie in my la&s;t action all the principles and &s;enti|ments
of my pa&s;t life?</P> 
<P>But without &s;peaking of my fame, which I &s;hould extremely injure
by &s;uch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to intreat a judge, nor to be
ab&s;olved by &s;upplications. He ought to be per&s;uaded and convinced. The
judge does not &s;it upon the bench to &s;hew favour, by violating the laws,
but to do ju&s;|tice in conforming to them. He does not &s;wear to di&s;charge
with impunity whom he plea&s;es, but to do ju&s;tice where it is due: we ought
not, therefore, to accu&s;tom you to per|jury, nor you to &s;uffer your&s;elves
to be ac|cu&s;tomed to it; for, in &s;o doing, both the one and the other of us
equally injure ju&s;tice and religion, and both are criminals.</P> 
<P>Do not, therefore, expect from me, Athenians, that I &s;hould have
recour&s;e among&s;t you to means which I believe neither hone&s;t nor lawful,
e&s;pecially upon this occa&s;ion, <PB N="387" REF="392"> wherein I am
accu&s;ed of impiety by Melitus; for, if I &s;hould influence you by my
prayers, and thereby induce you to violate your oaths, it would be undeniably
evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and
ju&s;tifying my&s;elf, &s;hould fur|ni&s;h my adver&s;aries with arms again&s;t
me, and prove that I believe no Divinity. But I am very far from &s;uch bad
thoughts: I am more convinced of the exi&s;tence of God than my ac|cu&s;ers;
and &s;o convinced, that I abandon my|&s;elf to God and you, that you may judge
of me as you &s;hall deem be&s;t for your&s;elves and me.</P> </Q>
<P>Socrates pronounced this di&s;cour&s;e with a firm and intrepid
tone: his air, his action, his vi&s;age, expre&s;&s;ed nothing of the
accu&s;ed; he &s;eemed the ma&s;ter of his judges, from the a&s;|&s;urance and
greatne&s;s of &s;oul with which he &s;poke, without however lo&s;ing any thing
of the mode&s;ty natural to him. But how &s;light &s;oever the proofs were
again&s;t him, the fac|tion was powerful enough to find him guilty. There was
the form of a proce&s;s again&s;t him, and his irreligion was the pretence upon
which it was grounded, but his death was certainly a concerted thing. His
&s;teady uninterrupted cour&s;e of ob&s;tinate virtue, which had made 
<PB N="388" REF="393"> him in many ca&s;es appear &s;ingular, and oppo&s;e
whatever he thought illegal or unju&s;t, without any regard to times or
per&s;ons, had procured him a great deal of envy and ill will.</P>
<P>By his fir&s;t &s;entence the judges only declar|ed Socrates guilty;
but when, by his an&s;wer, he appeared to appeal from their tribunal to that of
ju&s;tice and po&s;terity; when, in&s;tead of confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf guilty,
he demanded re|wards and honours from the &s;tate, the judges were &s;o very
much offended, that they con|demned him to drink hemlock, a method of execution
then in u&s;e among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Socrates received this &s;entence with the ut|mo&s;t compo&s;ure.
Apollodorus, one of his di&s;ciples, launching out into bitter invectives and
lamentations that his ma&s;ter &s;hould die <HI>innocent:</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"What," replied Socrates, with a &s;mile, "would you
have had me die guilty? Melitus and Anytus may kill, but they can|not hurt
me."</Q></P>
<P>After his &s;entence he &s;till continued with the &s;ame &s;erene
and intrepid a&s;pect with which he had long enforced virtue, and held tyrants
in awe; when he entered his pri&s;on, which now became the re&s;idence of
virtue and pro|bity, his friends followed him thither, and continued to vi&s;it
him during the interval be|tween <PB N="389" REF="394"> his condemnation and
death, which la&s;ted for thirty days. The cau&s;e of that long delay was, the
Athenians &s;ent every year a &s;hip to the i&s;le of Delos, to offer certain
&s;acri|fices, and it was prohibited to put any per&s;on to death in the city
from the time the prie&s;t of Apollo had crowned the poop of this ve&s;&s;el as
a &s;ignal of its departure, till the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el &s;hould return; &s;o
that &s;entence having been pa&s;&s;ed upon Socrates the day after that
cere|mony began, it was nece&s;&s;ary to defer the execution of it for thirty
days, during the con|tinuance of this voyage.</P>
<P>In this long interval, death had &s;ufficient opportunities to
pre&s;ent it&s;elf before his eyes in all its terrors, and to put his
con&s;tancy to the proof, not only by the &s;evere rigour of a dungeon, and the
irons upon his legs, but by the continual pro&s;pect and cruel expectation of
an event of which nature is always abhorrent. In this &s;ad condition he did
not cea&s;e to enjoy that profound tranquility of mind which his friends had
always admired in him. He en|tertained them with the &s;ame temper he had
always expre&s;&s;ed; and Crito ob&s;erves, that the evening before his death,
he &s;lept as peaceably as at any other time. He compo&s;|ed al&s;o an hymn in
honour of Apollo and <PB N="390" REF="395"> Diana, and turned one of Ae&s;op's
fables into ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The day before, or the &s;ame day that the &s;hip was to arrive from
Delos, the return of which was to be followed by the death of So|crates, Crito,
his intimate friend, came to him early in the morning to let him know that bad
news; and, at the &s;ame time, that it de|pended only upon him&s;elf to quit
the pri&s;on; that the jailor was gained; that he would find the doors open,
and offered him a &s;afe retreat in The&s;&s;aly. Socrates laughed at this
propo|&s;al, and a&s;ked him, whither he knew any place out of Attica where
people did not die? Cri|to urged the thing very &s;eriou&s;ly, and pre&s;&s;ed
him to take the advantage of &s;o precious an opportunity, adding argument upon
argu|ment, to induce his con&s;ent, and to engage him to re&s;olve upon his
e&s;cape: without men|tioning the incon&s;olable grief he &s;hould &s;uffer for
the death of &s;uch a friend, how &s;hould he &s;upport the reproaches of an
infinity of people, who would believe that it was in his power to have &s;aved
him, but that he would not &s;acrifice a &s;mall part of his wealth for that
purpo&s;e: can the people ever be per&s;uaded that &s;o wi&s;e a man as
Socrates would not quit his pri&s;on when he might do it with all po&s;&s;ible
&s;ecurity? <PB N="391" REF="396"> Perhaps he might fear to expo&s;e his
friends, or to occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of their fortunes, or even of their lives
or liberty: ought there to be any thing more dear and precious to them than the
pre&s;ervation of Socrates? Even &s;trangers them&s;elves di&s;pute that honour
with them, many of whom have come expre&s;sly with con&s;iderable &s;ums of
money to purcha&s;e his e&s;cape, and declare, that they &s;hould think
them&s;elves highly honoured to receive him among&s;t them, and to &s;upply him
abun|dantly with all he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for: ought he to abandon
him&s;elf to enemies who have occa&s;ioned his being condemned unju&s;tly, and
can he think it allowable to betray his own cau&s;e? It is not e&s;&s;ential to
his goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice to &s;pare his fellow-citizens the guilt of
innocent blood: but if all the&s;e motives cannot alter him, and he is not
concerned in regard to him&s;elf, can he be in&s;en&s;ible to the in|tere&s;ts
of his children? In what a condition does he leave them; and can he forget the
fa|ther to remember only the philo&s;opher?</P>
<P>Socrates, after having heard him with atten|tion, prai&s;ed his
zeal, and expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude; but before he could give into his
opinion, was for examining whether it was ju&s;t for him to depart out of
pri&s;on without the con&s;ent of the Athe|nians. <PB N="392" REF="397"> The
que&s;tion therefore here is, to know whether a man condemned to die, though
unju&s;tly, can without a crime e&s;cape from ju&s;tice and the laws. Socrates
held that it was unju&s;t; and, therefore, nobly refu&s;ed to e&s;cape from
pri&s;on. He reverenced the laws of his country, and re&s;olved to obey them in
all things, even in his death.</P>
<P>At length the fatal &s;hip returned to Athens, which was in a manner
the &s;ignal for the death of Socrates. The next day all his friends, except
Plato, who was &s;ick, repaired to the pri&s;on early in the morning. The
jailor de|&s;ired them to wait a little, becau&s;e the eleven magi&s;trates
(who had the direction of the pri|&s;ons) were at that time &s;ignifying to the
pri|&s;oner that he was to die the &s;ame day. Pre|&s;ently after they entered,
and found Socrates, who&s;e chains had been taken off, &s;itting by Xantippe,
his wife, who held one of his children in her arms; as &s;oon as &s;he
per|ceived them, &s;etting up great cries, &s;obbing, and tearing her face and
hair, &s;he made the pri&s;on re&s;ound with her complaints; Oh, my dear
Socrates! your friends are come to &s;ee you this day for the la&s;t time! He
de&s;ired &s;he might be taken away, and &s;he was imme|diately carried
home.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="398"> Socrates pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day
with his friends, and di&s;cour&s;ed with them with his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s
and tranquility. The &s;ub|ject of conver&s;ation was the mo&s;t important, but
adapted to the pre&s;ent conjuncture; that is to &s;ay, the immortality of the
&s;oul. What gave occa&s;ion to this di&s;cour&s;e was, a que&s;tion introduced
in a manner by chance, Whether a true philo&s;opher ought not to de|&s;ire, and
take pains to die? This propo&s;ition taken too literally, implied an opinion,
that a philo&s;opher might kill him&s;elf. Socrates &s;hews that nothing is
more unju&s;t than this notion; and, that man appertaining to God, who formed
and placed him with his own hand in the po&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, cannot
abandon it without his permi&s;&s;ion, nor depart from life without his order.
What is it then that can induce a philo&s;opher to entertain this love for
death? It can be only the hope of that happi|ne&s;s which he expects in another
life; and that hope can be founded only upon the opinion of the &s;oul's
immortality.</P>
<P>Socrates employed the la&s;t day of his life in entertaining his
friends upon this great and important &s;ubject; from which conver&s;ation,
Plato's admirable dialogue, intitled the Phae|don, is wholly taken. He explains
to his <PB N="394" REF="399"> friends all the arguments for believing the
&s;oul immortal, and refutes all the objections again&s;t it, which are very
near the &s;ame as are made at this day.</P>
<P>When Socrates had done &s;peaking, Crito de&s;ired him to give him,
and the re&s;t of his friends, his la&s;t in&s;tructions in regard to his
children and other affairs, that by executing them they might have the
con&s;olation of doing him &s;ome plea&s;ure. I &s;hall recommend no|thing to
you this day, replied Socrates, more than I have already done, which is, to
take care of your&s;elves. You cannot do your&s;elves a greater &s;ervice, nor
do me and my family a greater plea&s;ure. Crito having a&s;ked him af|terwards
in what manner he thought fit to be buried? As you plea&s;e, &s;aid Socrates,
if you can lay hold of me, and I not e&s;cape out of your hands. At the &s;ame
time, looking on his friends with a &s;mile, I can never per&s;uade Crito, that
Socrates is he who conver&s;es with you, and di&s;po&s;es the &s;everal parts
of his di&s;|cour&s;e, for he always imagines that I am what he is going to
&s;ee dead in a little while; he confounds me with my carca&s;e, and therefore
a&s;ks me how I would be interred. In fini&s;h|ing the&s;e words, he ro&s;e up,
and went to bathe him&s;elf in a chamber adjoining. After he 
<PB N="395" REF="400"> came out of the bath, his children were brought to him,
for he had three, two very little, and the other grown up. He &s;poke to them
for &s;ome time, gave his orders to the women who took care of them, and then
di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them. Being returned into his cham|ber, he laid him&s;elf down
upon his bed.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant of the eleven entered at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and
having informed him that the time for drinking the hemlock was come, (which was
at &s;un-&s;et) the &s;ervant was &s;o much afflicted with &s;orrow, that he
turned his back and fell a-weeping. See, &s;aid Socrates, the good heart of
this man, &s;ince my impri|&s;onment he has often come to &s;ee me, and to
conver&s;e with me; he is more worthy than all his fellows: how heartily the
poor man weeps for me. This is a remarkable example, and might teach tho&s;e in
an office of this kind how they ought to behave to all pri&s;oners, but more
e&s;pecially to per&s;ons of merit, when they are &s;o unhappy to fall into
their hands. The fatal cup was brought. Socrates a&s;ked what it was
nece&s;&s;ary for him to do? Nothing more, replied the &s;ervant, than as
&s;oon as you have drank off the draught, to walk about till you find your legs
grow weary, and afterwards lie down upon your bed. He took the cup with|out 
<PB N="396" REF="401"> any emotion, or change in his colour or countenance; and
regarding the man with a &s;teady and a&s;&s;ured look: 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;aid he, what &s;ay you of this drink; may
one make a liba|tion out of it?"</Q> Upon being told that there was only enough
for one do&s;e: 
<Q REND="inline">"At lea&s;t, con|tinued he, we may &s;ay our prayers
to the gods, as it is our duty, and implore them to make our exit from this
world, and our la&s;t &s;tage happy, which is what I mo&s;t ardently beg of
them."</Q> After having &s;poke the&s;e words, he kept &s;ilence for &s;ome
time, and then drank off the whole draught with an amazing tran|quillity and
&s;erenity of a&s;pect not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed or conceived.</P>
<P>Till then his friends, with great violence to them&s;elves, had
refrained from tears, but af|ter he had drank the potion, they were no longer
their own ma&s;ters, and wept abundant|ly. Apollodorus, who had been in tears
during almo&s;t the whole conver&s;ation, began then to rai&s;e great cries,
and to lament with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive grief, as pierced the hearts of all
that were pre&s;ent. Socrates alone remained unmoved, and even reproved his
friends, tho' with his u&s;ual mildne&s;s and good nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"What are you doing? &s;aid he to them. I ad|mire at
you! Oh! what is become of your <PB N="397" REF="402"> virtue? Was it not for
this I &s;ent away the women, that they might not fall into the&s;e
weakne&s;&s;es; for I have always heard &s;ay that we ought to die peaceably,
and ble&s;&s;ing the gods. Be at ea&s;e, I beg you, and &s;hew more con&s;tancy
and re&s;olution."</Q> He then obliged them to re&s;train their tears.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he kept walking to and fro; and when he found his
legs grow weary, he laid down upon his back, as he had been directed.</P>
<P>The poi&s;on then operated more and more. When Socrates &s;ound it
began to gain up|on the heart, uncovering his face, which had been covered,
without doubt to prevent any thing from di&s;turbing him in his la&s;t moments,

<Q REND="inline">"Crito, &s;aid he, we owe a cock to Ae&s;culapius;
di&s;charge that vow for me, and pray do not forget it."</Q> Soon after which
he breathed his la&s;t. Crito went to his body, and clo&s;ed his mouth and
eyes. Such was the end of So|crates, in the fir&s;t year of the ninety-fifth
Olympiad, and the &s;eventieth of his age.</P>
<P>It was not till &s;ome time after the death of this great man, that
the people of Athens per|ceived their mi&s;take, and began to repent of it;
their hatred being &s;atisfied, their preju|dices <PB N="398" REF="403">
expired, and time having given them an opportunity for reflection, the
notorious in|ju&s;tice of the &s;entence appeared in all its hor|rors. Nothing
was heard throughout the city but di&s;cour&s;es in favour of Socrates. The
Academy, the Lycaeum, private hou&s;es, public walks, and market places,
&s;eemed &s;till to re|echo the &s;ound of his loved voice. 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, &s;aid they, he formed our youth, and taught
our children to love their country, and to honour their parents. In this place
he gave us his ad|mirable le&s;&s;ons, and &s;ometimes made us &s;ea|&s;onable
reproaches, to engage us more warmly in the pur&s;uit of virtue. Alas! how have
we rewarded him for &s;uch important &s;ervices?"</Q> Athens was in univer&s;al
mourning and con|&s;ternation. The &s;chools were &s;hut up, and all
exerci&s;es &s;u&s;pended. The accu&s;ers were call|ed to account for the
innocent blood they had cau&s;ed to be &s;hed. Melitus was condemned to die,
and the re&s;t bani&s;hed. Plutarch ob&s;erves, that all tho&s;e who had any
&s;hare in this black calumny were in &s;uch abomination among&s;t the
citizens, that no one would give them fire, an&s;wer them any que&s;tion, nor
go into the &s;ame bath with them, and had the place cleaned where they had had
bathed, le&s;t <PB N="399" REF="404"> they &s;hould be polluted by touching it,
which drove them into &s;uch de&s;pair, that many of them killed
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Athenians, not contented with having puni&s;hed his accu&s;ers,
cau&s;ed a &s;tatue of bra&s;s to be erected to him, of the workman&s;hip of
the celebrated Ly&s;ippus, and placed it in one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous
parts of the city. Their re&s;pect and gratitude ro&s;e even to a reli|gious
veneration; they dedicated a chapel to him, as to a hero and a demi-god, which
they called the Chapel of Socrates.</P>
