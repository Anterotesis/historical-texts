<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE WHIG CLUB.</HEAD>
<P>IN your integrity and abilities the people con|fide for protection, ju&s;tice, and redre&s;s. Upon the principles on which you have a&s;&s;ociated, they re&s;t their hopes. They expect from your virtue, &s;pirit, and per&s;everance, not only the pre&s;ervation of their rights, lately re&s;cued from an u&s;urped and foreign con|troul, but the perfection of their further claims, by removing that corruption which has contaminated every department of the State; which has tainted even the mo&s;t &s;ub|ordinate offices, which has encrea&s;ed and
<PB N="6" REF="4">
is encrea&s;ing under the dictates of the Bri|ti&s;h Mini&s;ter, for the evident purpo&s;e of repelling the generous energies of liberty.</P>
<P>Next to the law of religion, the law of the land &s;hould be the principal &s;tudy with a free people. A knowledge of the one be|ing as e&s;&s;ential to their temporal intere&s;ts as a knowledge of the other is to their eternal happine&s;s. Wilful ignorance will neither ex|cu&s;e the &s;oul before the tribunal of the creator, nor the per&s;on before the judg|ment &s;eat of the con&s;titution. To diffu&s;e legal information is the purpo&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay: it is not written to acquire fame&mdash; It is written to meet the approbation of the under&s;tanding, not to amu&s;e the fancy, and you will attend to it, from re&s;pect; to the &s;ubject on which it treats.</P>
<P>It is not in ornaments that the merit of an argument con&s;i&s;ts. In viewing a por|trait, the figure and features are the prin|cipal objects of contemplation; nor can the mo&s;t elegant drapery, or beautiful colouring plea&s;e the minds eye, where the arti&s;t de|viates
<PB N="7" REF="5">
from nature and truth. The intent will excu&s;e in your minds, the blemi&s;hes of the performance. The opinions, if not expre&s;&s;ed, are conceived in the ardor of pa|trioti&s;m; in di&s;intere&s;ted love for a commu|nity, where the writer received that life, which he thinks can only be well &s;pent in its &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The writer &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf pu&s;il|lanimous, and contemptible indeed, if in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between the friends of his country, and the purcha&s;ed dependants of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, he withheld the lit|tle contribution of knowledge, that his &s;tudies have afforded him. This is an aera, where every hone&s;t hand, every hone&s;t heart, and every hone&s;t head, &s;hould unite their ex|ertions, and with "a long pull, a &s;trong pull, and a pull all together," level to the earth that rotten fabric, where de&s;poti&s;m holds private coun&s;el with corruption, for the treacherous purpo&s;e of &s;apping, and overturning the noble&s;t con&s;titution that wi&s;|dom ever framed, or freedom ever de|fended.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">The authority delegated by the people to their repre&s;entatives in parliament, has now reverted to its original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. This then is the time, they &s;hould be informed how that tru&s;t has been executed, that they may know who has de&s;erved their appro|bation, who has merited their cen&s;ure and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Mea&s;ures militating with the liberty of the &s;ubject, have been carried into effect by ve|nal majorities. Every propo&s;ition brought forward to dimini&s;h undue influence, to e&s;tabli&s;h oecomy, to &s;ecure the revenue, to vindicate the law, and to ea&s;e the peo|ple, have been negatived by the &s;ame cor|rect power. Oppre&s;&s;ion has experienced im|punity, the injured have been denied re|dre&s;s, and the authority of law and &s;ound rea&s;on, has been trampled upon by the aggregate force of numbers. This then is the time when con&s;titutional knowledge &s;hould be de&s;eminated through the land, when the principles of legi&s;lation and law &s;hould be made known to the people at large.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">This is the time when men, who re|gard the intere&s;ts of their country, who are not equally in&s;en&s;ible to the value of their own honour, and the good of po&s;|terity, following the glorious example of your a&s;&s;ociation, &s;hould with all their pow|ers, promote the &s;pirit of liberty, till every heart pervaded by that divine e&s;&s;ence, which expands the under&s;tanding, and elates the mind, even of the meane&s;t pea&s;ant, vibrates with ardour and pants to &s;pring forth the guardian of tho&s;e principles, which emanate from the bo&s;om of God!&mdash;The protector of tho&s;e laws, which are derived from the immutable decrees of the eternal code, laid down by providence, and delivered to man at the creation!</P>
<P>The moment has &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the people of Ireland demanded and acquired the re&s;titution of their rights, with arms in their hands.&mdash;They have laid down their arms, and their rights are again in|vaded. Where then are they to find pro|tection? They can only in&s;ure it by a &s;trict and firm adherence to tho&s;e re&s;olu|tions,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
which you have formed for their political creed. Let the people zealou&s;ly &s;upport the doctrines you have promulged; let them not tamely &s;it down &s;atisfied with the melancholy privilege of complaint; let them prove by their &s;pirit in the face of heaven and of the world, that by what|ever right Engli&s;hmen po&s;&s;e&s;s freedom, by the &s;ame right, Iri&s;hmen, and all mankind may claim it.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing pro|perty of mankind is the immortality of his &s;oul; and we find the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of that immortality in the freedom of his mind, which includes the right of declaring all our thoughts! In this free-will, derived from God, originated the liberty of the pre&s;s, that &s;acred medium through which every freeman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the ble&s;&s;ing, has a right to declare his opinions on pub|lic men, and on public mea&s;ures. Every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint of the pre&s;s, being then a re&s;traint of the free will of man, is an act of tyranny. By &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the exerci&s;e of intellectual liberty, &s;lavery has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed&mdash;by
<PB N="11" REF="9">
giving it fair &s;cope freedom has been re&s;tored. The hi&s;tories of nations are illu&s;trations of this po&s;ition, and recent proofs are to be found in the fears of Spain and Portugal&mdash;in the &s;pirit of America and France&mdash;in the revolutions of Great Baitain and Ireland.</P>
<P>Then let the pre&s;s exert her powers. Notwith&s;tanding the re&s;traints lately laid on her natural vigour, &s;he &s;till retains &s;ufficient &s;trength to drag before the people tho&s;e pu&s;illanimous, corrupt, and abdicating cul|prits, who, de&s;erting from the &s;tandard of freedom, have enli&s;ted with pro&s;tituted mer|cenaries, and war again&s;t common &s;en&s;e, and the law of the land.</P>
<P>The pre&s;s &s;till retains &s;ufficient ability to hunt from their lurking places, and &s;courge into &s;hame and repentance, tho&s;e adulating and degenerate mon&s;ters, who point out to every alien plunderer, the &s;ecret &s;prings, the honey, and the trea&s;ures of the land; who have entered into con&s;piracies with &s;trangers, again&s;t its legal owners, and who
<PB N="12" REF="10">
have &s;tripped the laborious pea&s;ant, and the indu&s;trious manufacturer, of their fruits and earnings.</P>
<P>This is the moment to bring about poli|tical reformation, for extirpating venality&mdash;and the pre&s;s is the mo&s;t effectual means: Was the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> &s;ubverted, and <HI>tyranny</HI> &s;eated on her throne, &s;urrounded by her &s;ycophants, her para&s;ites, her informers, her guards, her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and her executioners, a free pre&s;s would <HI>re&s;tore</HI> the one and <HI>over|turn</HI> the other.</P>

<HEAD>THE ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be objected, that this e&s;&s;ay is ill-timed; as tending to influence the deter|mination of &s;uits now pending; but the ob|jection is erroneous: The que&s;tions are not of <HI>law</HI> but of <HI>fact.</HI> The determinations lie with <HI>juries</HI> not with <HI>judges.</HI> The inquiries on the trials will be merely, whether the defendant be <HI>guilty</HI> or not <HI>guilty</HI> of the injury laid in the declaration, and if <HI>guilty,</HI> what <HI>damages</HI> the plaintiffs have &s;u&s;tained. The arguing <HI>points of law</HI> is at all times legal, and the points herein di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, are in every re&s;pect irrelevant to the merits of the i&s;&s;ues which the juries are to try. Any man as <HI>amicus curiae</HI> may inform a judge on a <HI>point of law,</HI> but no man &s;hall give information to a jury on a fact, unle&s;s he be a witne&s;s previou&s;ly &s;worn. Earl Mansfield &s;ome years ago pro|hibited the publication of evidence given
<PB N="14" REF="12">
again&s;t pri&s;oners on examinations before ju&s;|&s;tices of the peace, becau&s;e the evidence being exparte, the publi&s;hing of it tended to create an influence again&s;t the pri&s;oner, which might be injurious to him on trial; but no judge ever yet a&s;&s;erted that animadverting on matters of law was illegal, and yet in the ca&s;e of general warrants, the pre&s;s teemed with legal di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es for promulging the law of the land, on the di&s;cretion of judges in granting fiats, and on bail, having originated in the &s;uits carried on again&s;t Magee, the printer, it will be frequently nece&s;&s;ary to advert to them. In doing this, however, it is not intended to &s;tigmatize with invective, or &s;e|vere imputations, the pro&s;ecutors or plain|tiffs. The law gives a remedy for every injury, and if they &s;uffered, or imagined they &s;uffered wrong, they had an unque&s;|tionable right to &s;eek redre&s;s from the laws of their country.</P>
<P>Magee, con&s;idered as a private individual, is equally an object of indifference. This
<PB N="15" REF="13">
e&s;&s;ay neither takes into con&s;ideration his guilt, nor his innocence, that is the pro|vince of a jury; but the proceedings again&s;t him, are of the mo&s;t &s;erious concern to the people; every individual, of whom are entitled to inquire, whether his own rights and liberties have been attacked in the per&s;on of his fellow citizen, under the &s;anction of a proce&s;s, i&s;&s;uing from a court of law, which, by its in&s;titution, is the guardian and protector of tho&s;e rights and liberties.</P>
<P>The honour of the laws of Ireland, its judges, and its profe&s;&s;ors, is al&s;o materially involved in the ultimate deci&s;ion upon the&s;e proceedings. The Engli&s;h bar have treated them with contempt and reprobation. It is at this day a common ob&s;ervation in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, that "Ireland will &s;oon repent the lo&s;s of writs of error and ap|peal to the courts of England." Mu&s;t not the pride and &s;en&s;ibility of Iri&s;hmen, &s;uffer to the quick from the fallacious &s;lander, thus indi&s;criminately thrown upon all the judges, and all the barri&s;ters of this king|dom?
<PB N="16" REF="14">
And mu&s;t not the&s;e &s;ufferings be aggravated in the minds of tho&s;e who know, that un&s;ullied purity, exten&s;ive know|ledge and great ability, have ever been found at the Iri&s;h bar? That the bench is radiated by &s;acred worth, &s;pirit, and in|dependence? That the law is promulged by judges of inflexible integrity, united with intelligent minds, fortified by invin|cible virtue, and di&s;pi&s;ing with equal con|tempt tho&s;e accommodating fears, which &s;ometimes give temporary popularity, and tho&s;e mean pliabilities, which bow and cringe with implicit obedience, to the in|fluence of every admini&s;tration?</P>
<P>Under the torture of tho&s;e &s;ufferings, the writer of this e&s;&s;ay with &s;edulous at|tention, &s;earched the records and repo&s;ito|ries of the law, for precedent or princi|ple, upon which he could ju&s;tify, excu&s;e, or even palliate tho&s;e proceedings, thus re|probated in England.</P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="15">He found that the opinions of the Eng|li&s;h lawyers, &s;o far as they re&s;pected ar|re&s;ts by fiat, in ca&s;es of libels, were well grounded; and, to his great &s;atisfaction, he is now convinced that the Iri&s;h bar, and every independent member of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons, maintain the &s;ame doctrine, and have thereby vindicated the juri&s;prudence of their country, and the an|cient practice of their courts from wanton and ra&s;h a&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e extraordinary proceedings, thus uni|ver&s;ally condemned, of cour&s;e appeared to him as ra&s;h and alarming innovations on the indubitable rights of the people. They appeared to him as grievances, &s;pringing from latent motives, and tending either to oppre&s;s private individuals, or to e&s;tabli&s;h precedents for the purpo&s;e of coercing the liberty of the pre&s;s, an object that has been repeatedly attempted, and too often with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince Mr. Pitt has been placed at the head of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, though no mini&s;ter was ever &s;upported by a more licentious abu&s;e of his opponents.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"><HI>The Ca&s;e of</HI> MAGEE, <HI>is this,</HI></P>
<P>He has been arre&s;ted on fiats, or judges warrants, and held to &s;pecial bail in &s;everal actions, brought again&s;t him for publi&s;hing libels on private individuals; and he has been held to bail in the following &s;ums&mdash;four thou|&s;and pounds&mdash;eight hundred pounds&mdash;one thou&s;and pounds&mdash;and two thou&s;and pounds, making in the whole, the &s;um of &s;even thou|&s;and eight hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Now as each bond&s;man mu&s;t &s;wear him|&s;elf, when ju&s;tifying his bail, worth double the &s;um for which he becomes bound, the bail demanded amounts to thirty-one thou|&s;and two hundred pounds! and this unfor|tunate defendant is a private &s;ubject&mdash;the printer of a new&s;paper!</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions re&s;ult from this ca&s;e:</P>
<P>FIRST&mdash;<HI>Were the arre&s;ts legal?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17">SECOND&mdash;<HI>If the arre&s;ts were legal&mdash;was the &s;pecial bail demanded of the defendant legal?</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions it has been a&s;&s;erted&mdash;</P>
<P>That the right of granting a fiat is with|in the <HI>di&s;cretionary power</HI> of the judge: And,</P>
<P>That the <HI>quantum</HI> of bail demanded is within the &s;ame <HI>di&s;cretionary power.</HI></P>
<P>It is therefore the purport of this e&s;&s;ay to &s;hew, that the charges exhibited again&s;t the de|fendant being for libels, and the objects of the imputed calumnies private individuals, the interference of a judge, by fiat, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is <HI>unprecedented,</HI> the &s;pecial bail de|manded of the defendant <HI>exce&s;&s;ive;</HI> that nei|ther of tho&s;e acts of the judge are within the rules of <HI>legal di&s;cretion,</HI> and that they are both <HI>contrary to the</HI> LAW OF THE LAND.</P>
<P>The granting of fiats, in any ca&s;e, being di&s;cretionary, the fir&s;t point to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="20" REF="18">
is the nature, and legal extent of that power.</P>
<P>LORD COKE defines <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> thus&mdash;It is, &s;ays that learned juri&s;t, to di&s;cern between right and wrong, &s;hadows and &s;ub&s;tance, equity and colourable glo&s;&s;es, and not to do according to our <HI>will</HI> and private <HI>affections;</HI> and &s;uch di&s;cretion is to be <HI>limitted</HI> and <HI>bounded.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 In&s;t. 56.</NOTE> Therefore, whoever hath power to act at <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> is bound by the rule of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and law. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 In&s;t. 298.</NOTE> For <HI>ju&s;tices</HI> mu&s;t remember that it is <HI>legal di&s;cretion,</HI> in which, in <HI>favour of li|berty,</HI> great <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> is to be u&s;ed,&mdash;And though there be a latitude of di&s;cretion given to one, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hob. 158.</NOTE> yet he is <HI>circum&s;cribed</HI> that what he does be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>convenient,</HI> without which no liberty, no claim to juri&s;diction can de|fend it.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons when the law leaves any thing, to any per&s;on, to be done according to his <HI>di&s;cretion,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Lit. ab. 477.</NOTE> the law intends it mu&s;t be done with <HI>&s;ound di&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>according to</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="19">
<HI>law.</HI> And the COURT OF KING'S BENCH hath a power to redre&s;s things that are other|wi&s;e done, notwith&s;tanding that they are left to the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of tho&s;e who do them.</P>
<P>The &s;uperintending power which the con|&s;titution thus repo&s;es in the court of king's bench, does not, however, authori&s;e the judges of that court to exerci&s;e an <HI>uncontrol|led di&s;cretion</HI> over the per&s;onal liberty of the &s;ubject. The re&s;trictive rules of <HI>legal di&s;cre|tion,</HI> are as binding on the chief-ju&s;tice and his brethren, whether acting collectively, or individually as on any &s;ubordinate magi&s;|trate; they are as &s;trictly binding on judges in courts of law, as principles and prece|dents are binding on the chancellor, or the barons of the exchequer in the courts of equity.</P>
<P>If <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> was not thus circum&s;cribed the &s;ubject, &s;ays Lord Coke, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 In&s;t.</NOTE> would feel it a <HI>crooked line, ruinous to the</HI> per&s;onal liberties of the people; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Black. 134.</NOTE> who&s;e liberties or rights have never been abridged, by the laws of England, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mont. S.</NOTE> without &s;ufficient cau&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">L. b. 11. c. 5.</NOTE> and can
<PB N="22" REF="20">
not ever be abridged, at the mere <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the magi&s;trate, without explicit permi&s;|&s;ion from the laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Black. 6.</NOTE> The rea&s;on of this doctrine is obvious. Civil liberty which is the very end and &s;cope of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, rightly under&s;tood, con&s;i&s;ts in the power of doing whatever the laws permit; which is only to be effected by a general conformity of all orders and degrees, to tho&s;e equitable rules of action, <NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;t. 1. 3. 1.</NOTE> by which the <HI>meane&s;t individual,</HI> is protected from the in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t. If this was not the ca&s;e there would be no liberty. For as Smith in his Commonwealth of England ob&s;erves, &s;peaking of a court of equity, there is as much difference between the <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of men, or their <HI>di&s;cretion,</HI> as between the mea&s;ure of their feet; and as one man may have a longer or &s;horter foot than another man, &s;o may his <HI>con&s;cience</HI> or di&s;cretion be more contracted or exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>If the per&s;onal liberty of the &s;ubject was not thus protected by the law; if the highe&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="21">
magi&s;trate, the KING him&s;elf, was not thus re&s;tricted in the exerci&s;e of <HI>di&s;cretion,</HI> weak, or corrupt judges, influenced by caprice, by re&s;entment, by party prejudice, or by ob&s;ti|nate ignorance might, under pretence of le|gal authority, exerci&s;e an <HI>arbitrary power.</HI> The fiat or warrant would attack the per&s;on of the de&s;tined victim&mdash;The demand of enormous bail would &s;end him to pri&s;on, where his &s;ufferings being unknown to the public, or if known, being &s;oon forgotten, inevitable ruin, to him&s;elf and family, would be the con&s;equence. Impri&s;onment is the lea&s;t public, the lea&s;t &s;triking &s;pecies of puni&s;hment. <HI>Arbitrary</HI> power of inflicting it, is the mo&s;t dangerous engine that could be put into the hands of a man inclined to injure the rights of the people. Therefore, the common law has wi&s;ely provided again&s;t it, by the writ of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> which by a declaratory enacting and penal &s;tatute, has been made one of the great bulwarks of the peoples' liberties.</P>
<P>Happy is it for the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h crowns, that <HI>judicial di&s;cretion</HI> is thus cir|cum&s;cribed
<PB N="24" REF="22">
within the bounds of rea&s;on, and controled by the rules of law. Men of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate knowledge and unbia&s;&s;ed probity, are &s;till men. Be their judgments ever &s;o acute, their hearts ever &s;o uncorrupt, yet even too exqui&s;ite a &s;en&s;ibility of nature may in &s;ome ca&s;es mi&s;guide the one and pervert the other. Affection and prejudice operate &s;trongly in per&s;ons of lively &s;en&s;ati|ons and urge them often to be unju&s;t in tho&s;e very in&s;tances wherein they flatter them&s;elves they are only generous. Rare are tho&s;e talents which con&s;titute a great judicial character. It requires a ready and clear ap|prehen&s;ion; a found, di&s;tingui&s;hing and exact act judgment; a comprehen&s;ive under&s;tand|ing; freedom and liberality of thought; &s;a|gacity to inve&s;tigate the great principles of ju&s;tice; and di&s;cernment to &s;ee where tho&s;e principles lead.&mdash;BACON was the wi&s;e&s;t chan|cellor ever &s;at in a court of equity: JEF|FERIES was a mo&s;t excellent lawyer; but the one was corrupt, and the other was cruel. Had the&s;e men been ignorant, would their oppre&s;&s;ions have been le&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="23">Having &s;hown the nature and legal ex|tent of di&s;cretionary power in judges the next point is,</P>

<P>The granting of a fiat, or judges warrant to hold a defendant to bail, is a tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in the judges, to be exerci&s;ed only on extraordinary ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; and in what ever ca&s;e they are granted, the greate&s;t delicacy, circum&s;pection and precau|tion &s;hould be attended to.</P>
<P>A fiat &s;hould never be granted in any ca&s;e, but on po&s;itive affidavit, &s;tating &s;pecial circum&s;tances of actual lo&s;s, of mayhem, of battery, or that the defendant is going to quit the kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 In&s;t. 186.</NOTE> If a per&s;on has dangerou&s;ly wounded another, the ju&s;tice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail, till the year and day be pa&s;t; becau&s;e the defendant is liable to an indictment for murder, if the wounded party die within a year and day; and the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;hews
<PB N="26" REF="24">
the nece&s;&s;ity of granting a warrant to appre|hend the delinquent; be&s;ides in ca&s;es of actions for mayhem, or violent battery, the wounds and the blows are po&s;&s;itive proofs of <HI>actual injury,</HI> and a breach of the peace. The aggre&s;&s;or is therefore held to bail not only to an&s;wer the damages, but to prevent his flight from ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When a fiat is applied for on a po&s;itive affidavit that the defendant is going to leave the kingdom, and the proof of &s;uch fact is accompanied with the further proof of &s;pe|cific damages, a fiat is nece&s;&s;ary to render &s;uch defendant ameanable to ju&s;tice, and the con&s;equences of the &s;uit. It is more expeditiou&s;ly procured than the writ <HI>ne exeat regno,</HI> which may be granted, in any ca&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chanc.

<P>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE HOLT &s;ays, a <HI>ne exeat regno</HI> ought not to be granted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chanc. Ca&s;. 245.</NOTE> but upon great rea&s;on and examination, otherwi&s;e a <HI>homine replegiando</HI> may lie. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Farr. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the application for the writ <HI>ne exeat regno,</HI> which is a prerogative or &s;tate writ, no <HI>general averment,</HI> though upon <HI>oath</HI> will be held &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The plaintiff applying for a <HI>ne exeat regno,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Skinn. 136.</NOTE> is to make po&s;itive oath of his <HI>debt,</HI> and the writ is always marked for the &s;um &s;worn in the affidavit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chanc.

The order is till an&s;wer, or further order, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Ray. 696.</NOTE> and the party is obliged to give &s;ecurity before the court will di&s;charge the writ, which &s;ecurity is taken by recognizance before a ma&s;ter, and is in the penalty of what is &s;worn to be <HI>actually</HI> due and the &s;heriff takes bail accordingly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;. in B.

<PB N="28" REF="26">
when he arre&s;ts the party thereon, <NOTE PLACE="marg">S tiles 441. &mdash;442.</NOTE> the &s;um &s;wom to be due being con&s;tantly endor&s;ed on the <HI>ne exeat regno</HI> as a guide for the &s;heriff to take bail by.</P>
<P>From a comparative view of the writ of <HI>ne exeat regno</HI> with a <HI>judges fiat,</HI> it appears then, that in granting the latter, the judge &s;hould con&s;ider and &s;trictly adhere to the le|gal rules of <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> which are &s;trictly fol|lowed in granting the former.</P>
<P>The <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> for granting a fiat &s;hould be equally &s;trong. The <HI>facts</HI> &s;tated in the affi|davit &s;hould be equally &s;pecific, and the &s;itua|tion of the plaintiff, his <HI>credibility,</HI> and his cau&s;e of action, &s;hould equally entitle him to this extraordinary interference and favour of the judge.</P>
<P>Thus in Hilary 1787, in the common pleas of England, an application was made to Mr. Ju&s;tice Gould to hold a defendant to bail, on a breach of promi&s;e of marriage. The affidavit &s;tated the cau&s;e of action, that de|fendant (a lady) was going to quit the king|dom,
<PB N="29" REF="27">
and that plaintiff bad &s;uffered five hun|dred pounds damages. The judge held this affidavit in&s;ufficient, becau&s;e plaintiff did not &s;pecifically &s;tate the cau&s;e or cau&s;es by which the damages accrued, but gave him leave to amend. He then &s;wore, that at the particu|lar reque&s;t of the defendant, he &s;old his com|mi&s;&s;ion for five hundred pounds, and &s;pent the money on her, &s;he having po&s;itively pro|mi&s;ed him marriage, and to purcha&s;e him a commi&s;&s;ion of higher rank, and on this af|fidavit &s;he was held to bail.</P>
<P>No man will be &s;o weak or &s;o ra&s;h as to a&s;&s;ert that the &s;ame caution and preci&s;&s;ion is not nece&s;&s;ary in granting a <HI>warrant</HI> at the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of a judge, that the law requires in i&s;&s;uing a <HI>prerogative writ.</HI> The latter is a royal <HI>tru&s;t</HI> repo&s;ed in the king, <NOTE PLACE="marg">F. N. B. 95.</NOTE> which the law does not pre&s;ume that he will abu&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lane 29.</NOTE> or make u&s;e of to the prejudice of his &s;ubjects. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Co. 17.

<P><PB N="30" REF="28">Having examined the nature and legal extent of <HI>di&s;cretionary power,</HI> the next ob|ject is,</P>
<P>Whether a defendant can be held to bail for publi&s;hing a libel? again&s;t a private in|dividual.</P>
<P>Magna Charta enacts, that no man &s;hall be impri&s;oned but by judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. The impri&s;onment of Magee has not been by the judgment of his peers. Has it been by the law of the land? The an&s;wer is, there is neither law nor practice to &s;up|port &s;uch a proceeding; for the di&s;cretion exerci&s;ed, is not within the rules of " &s;ound rea&s;on, law, nece&s;&s;ity, and convenience."</P>
<P>The definition of a libel &s;hows, that it is not an offence, for which a defendant &s;hould be held to bail, even on a crimi|nal action.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">A libel is a <HI>mi&s;demeanor.</HI> and is e&s;teem|ed as &s;uch, not for being a <HI>breach</HI> of the peace, but for its direct <HI>tendency</HI> to a breach of the peace by provoking to fight. Now, the law of England never intended, that the &s;ubject &s;hould be held to bail for any mi&s;demeanor, that did not amount to an actual <HI>breach of the peace;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Mod. 178.</NOTE> and formerly none could be taken up for a mi&s;demeanor till indictment found. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Regina v. Tracy. 1 Haw. 130.</NOTE> Therefore, mere words of pa&s;&s;ion, as liar, knave, or ra&s;|cal, do not create a <HI>forfeiture of recogni|zance</HI> to keep the peace, for they do not challenge a man to <HI>break</HI> the peace, though they <HI>tend</HI> to it; from which the rea&s;onable conclu&s;ion is, that as <HI>&s;lander</HI> does not in|cur a forfeiture of recognizance for keep|ing the peace, neither is it an offence that can ju&s;tify a judge, in holding a defendant to bail.</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered, that, though bail is not demandable in a criminal pro&s;ecution for a libel, again&s;t a private individual, yet the plaintiff may demand it in a civil &s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="30">Tho&s;e who thus argue, are called upon to &s;hew a precedent, for holding a defen|dant to bail on any action for a libel, ex|cept in ca&s;es of <HI>&s;candalum magnatum,</HI> or &s;lander of title. To make a plaintiff a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his owm damages, conceived perhaps in a moment of heat or re&s;entment would be, to e&s;tabli&s;h the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;chief. Damages can|not be a&s;certained but by verdict of a jury on hearing evidence, and in many ca&s;es ver|dicts have been &s;et a&s;ide for exce&s;s of da|mages. Perjury and oppre&s;&s;ion would be among the con&s;equences. It would be de|ciding by anticipation on the quantum of damages, which the jury &s;hould give, and on the oath of the plaintiff him&s;elf. It would be contrary to natural ju&s;tice, and the liberty of the &s;ubject, by enabling an inhuman plaintiff to impri&s;on a poor friend|le&s;s defendant, upon an averment, for the &s;pace of three terms, when upon trial it might appear that he was not guilty of the fact, or that what he publi&s;hed was not actionable. It would be u&s;ele&s;s as well as cruel, for thus puni&s;hing before conviction by fiat, when accompanied by exce&s;&s;ive bail,
<PB N="33" REF="31">
would be only a &s;everity known in tho&s;e countries, where private informers are encouraged to pro&s;ecute men obnoxious to the &s;tate, and where torture precedes trial.</P>
<P>The following cau&s;es lately tried at We&s;t|min&s;ter, are &s;o many proofs, that it is not the practice of the courts there, to grant warrants either in criminal or civil &s;ults brought upon libel.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es were&mdash;</P>

<P><HI>The Attorney General,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Stockdale.</HI> Information by order of the King on addre&s;s of the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>The libels in all the above cau&s;es, (except the la&s;t), were of the mo&s;t atrocious nature. Among the pro&s;ecutors and plaintiffs are &s;een
<PB N="35" REF="33">
the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters. A queen, three princes, a lord chief ju&s;tice and a doctor of laws. Walter and Withers were convicted and &s;everely puni&s;hed. Lord Loughborough and Mr. Pitt recovered da|mages. Perryman and Almon fled and were proceeded again&s;t by outlawry; yet, in none of the&s;e pro&s;ecutions and &s;uits, which <HI>all</HI> ori|ginated within the la&s;t two years, was a de|fendant held to bail, or a fiat even demanded.</P>
<P>The above ca&s;es are proofs &s;ufficient to &s;hew that on pro&s;ecution and actions for libels, it is not the practice of the court of King's Bench of England to i&s;&s;ue &s;uch proce&s;s: and it follows that &s;uch practice can not be legal here; for practice mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with law, and the common law of England, is by the a&s;&s;ent and adoption of the people of Ireland, the common law of Ireland.</P>
<P>Can it be &s;hewn that EARL MANSFIELD, a prerogative judge, who extended the law of libels to its utmo&s;t &s;tretch, ever granted a fiat in the ca&s;e of a libel? Certainly not; his lord&s;hip well knew it was not within
<PB N="36" REF="34">
his <HI>judicial di&s;cretion;</HI> he well knew there was neither law nor practice to ju&s;tify the i&s;&s;uing of &s;uch a proce&s;s, in &s;uch a ca&s;e. To all tho&s;e therefore who argue in &s;up|port of the legal authority to hold defen|dants to bail for publi&s;hing libels, may be applied Earl Cambden's requi&s;ition to the noble lord above mentioned, who in arguing the writ of error brought on the judgment in the King's Bench on literary property &s;aid&mdash;<HI>"Shew me a ca&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing a few ca&s;es &s;hould be &s;hewn in &s;upport of practice, does it follow that the fiats recently i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Magee are legal? Practice, like cu&s;tom, if contrary to law cannot be &s;anctified by repetition or continuance. General warrants were in practice from the revolution down to the 6th of the pre&s;ent king, when after being &s;olemnly argued in the court of Common Pleas and King's Bench, they were de|clared illegal.</P>
<P>"The practice of a <HI>particular magi&s;trate</HI> cannot controul the law. <HI>Communis error</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="35">
is not in this ca&s;e &s;ufficient to make law. This is the <HI>duty</HI> and therefore doubtle&s;s the <HI>inclination</HI> of the court to &s;top the mi&s;chief as &s;oon as it is com|plained of."&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of General Warrants</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e were the words of Dunning a great con&s;titutional lawyer, <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Burr. 1762.</NOTE> and they made a proper impre&s;&s;ion upon the court: for in the &s;ame ca&s;e Lord Mansfield &s;aid, "a <HI>u&s;age</HI> to grow into law ought to be a general u&s;age, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Money et al ver&s;us Leach.</NOTE> <HI>communiter u&s;itata et ap|probata;</HI> and which after a long con|tinuance it would be mi&s;chievous to over|turn: <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Burr. 1762.</NOTE> and, Mr. Ju&s;tice A&s;ton added, "<HI>No degree of antiquity</HI> can give &s;anction to a u&s;age bad in it&s;elf."</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be advanced, that if the judges had not authority to hold libellers to bail, ju&s;tice would be evaded and delinquents e&s;cape with impunity. But is that the ca&s;e? If the defendant flies, proce&s;s of outlawry i&s;&s;ues again&s;t him, and the voluntary tran&s;portation of his per&s;on by flight is a &s;everer puni&s;hment in the eye of the

<P>Magna Charta has been mentioned and ma|ny other old &s;tatutes are equally applicable. By the 25. of Edward 3.

<P>The foregoing ca&s;es, will all apply as &s;trongly in elucidation of the &s;ub&s;equent part of this e&s;&s;ay, as they have in &s;up|porting the anterior argument.&mdash;But if there was not a ca&s;e or &s;tatute in point, the que&s;tion on <HI>fiats</HI> could be decided upon <HI>principles.</HI></P>
<P>It is a principle that no man &s;hall be impri|&s;oned but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land&mdash;Now the law of the land will not hold a man to bail for <HI>&s;landerous words</HI>&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna Charta.</NOTE>
<PB N="46" REF="44">
and where the law holds a man to bail, it mu&s;t be for a <HI>&s;um &s;pecifically &s;worn to,</HI> and the law of the land forbids that bail to be <HI>exce&s;&s;ive.</HI> But if the proceedings in the &s;uits again&s;t Magee, were net prohibited by any po&s;itive law, nor adjudged illegal by any precedents, yet they might be decided to be &s;o upon <HI>principles,</HI> and the law of England would be a &s;trange &s;cience indeed if it were decided upon <HI>precedent</HI> only. Prece|dents &s;erve to illu&s;trate principles and to give them a fixed certainty; but the com|mon law, which is every man's birth-right, is exclu&s;ive of po&s;&s;itive law enacted by &s;tatute, and depends upon principles. Cowper. 39.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn, that in actions for <HI>&s;lander,</HI> neither the law of the land, nor the prac|tice of the courts ju&s;tify judges, in holding defendants to bail.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is:</P>
<P>Supp&s;iong a judge, or a court of ju&s;tice, to po&s;&s;e&s;s di&s;cretionary power to hold a de|fendant to bail on pro&s;ecutions, or &s;uits for
<PB N="47" REF="45">
libels, was the bail in which Magee was held, within the rules of that <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> and authorized by the law of the land; or was it what the law terms <HI>exce&s;&s;ive?</HI></P>
<P>DALTON and BACON define bail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalt. 166. 1 New ab. 205.</NOTE> to be an <HI>undertaking</HI> of a <HI>man's friends,</HI> before certain per&s;ons, for that purpo&s;e authorized, that he &s;hall appear at a certain day, and place certain, and an&s;wer any legal charges exhibited again&s;t him.</P>
<P>This definition is grounded on that given by Bracton. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib 3. Tract. 2. ca 8. mu. 8. 9.</NOTE> Bail, ballium (from the French bailler, which comes from the Greek, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and &s;ignifies to deliver into hands) is u&s;ed in our common law, for <HI>freeing,</HI> or <HI>&s;etting at liberty,</HI> one <HI>arre&s;ted,</HI> or <HI>impri&s;oned,</HI> upon any action, either <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>criminal,</HI> on &s;urety taken for his appearance, at a day and place certain.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why it is called <HI>bail</HI> is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Impey's Practice in B. R. High-more on Bail.</NOTE> be|cau&s;e by this means in the ca&s;e of civil actions, the party re&s;trained, is delivered into the hands of tho&s;e, who bind them|&s;elves
<PB N="48" REF="46">
for his forth coming, in order to a <HI>&s;afe keeping, or protection from pri&s;on,</HI> and the end of bail in a civil action, is to &s;a|tisfy the condemnation and co&s;ts, or to render the defendant to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In all civil actions, whereon bail may be taken, <NOTE PLACE="marg">See the ca&s;es al|ready cited.</NOTE> there &s;hall be a po&s;itive affidavit of the cau&s;e of action, and no <HI>averment</HI> of damages is &s;ufficient, though on oath, to hold a defendant to bail. If a judge, will however take upon him to exceed his <HI>judicial di&s;cretion,</HI> and hold a defendant to bail, upon an averment of damages, whereby he allows the plaintiff to a&s;&s;e&s;s his own &s;atisfaction, which is clearly the exclu|&s;ive right of a jury, he &s;hould take care, that the e&s;timate of the plaintiff be not &s;o <HI>high</HI> as to <HI>impri&s;on</HI> the defendant, but &s;o <HI>low</HI> as not to prohibit what the law allows him, <HI>"protection from pri&s;on;"</HI> for this would be tant amount to <HI>withholding</HI> of bail.</P>
<P>In criminal ca&s;es, bail is not only the means of <HI>giving liberty</HI> to the pri&s;oner, but
<PB N="49" REF="47">
at the &s;ame time, &s;ecures the extent of the law to puni&s;h an offender, and as it is the <HI>undertaking of a man's friends,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of his appearing to take his trial, or be dealt with according to law.; therefore, bail de|manded at the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the judge, &s;hould always bear a relation to the defendant's &s;ituation in life, as well as to the offence charged upon him; for &s;hould the bail be exce&s;&s;ive, the defendant is precluded from that <HI>"undertaking of his friends,"</HI> which the law allows, "to protect him from pri|&s;on, and the judge does not act according to the rules of <HI>law and &s;ound rea&s;on,</HI> which are the guides to <HI>judicial di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P>The law, by which bail is regulated in criminal and civil actions, appears clearly to be founded on the &s;ame principles, and to have the &s;ame great object in view, <HI>"the liberty of the &s;ubject."</HI> It never was intended that a man &s;hould be impri&s;oned for <HI>damages,</HI> till tho&s;e damages were <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a jury,</HI> or for an <HI>offence</HI> till <HI>convicted by his country,</HI> unle&s;s that offence was of &s;uch enormity and notoriety, that the four walls
<PB N="50" REF="48">
of a pri&s;on only could be con&s;idered certain &s;ecurity, for his per&s;on.</P>
<P>What is <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> bail, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 New Ab. 226. Dalt. 14. 2. Hawk. p.c. 88. 89. Hal. p. c. 97.</NOTE> may ea&s;ily be col|lected from the e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the land. It is &s;aid, not to be u&s;ual for the King's-Bench to bail a man on a <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> on a commitment for trea&s;on or felony, without four &s;ureties, and the &s;um in which the &s;ureties are to be bound, ought never be le&s;s than forty pounds for a <HI>capital crime;</HI> and in all felonies there &s;hould be two &s;ureties; but it may be higher in <HI>di&s;|cretion,</HI> on con&s;ideration of the ability and quality of the pri&s;oner, and the nature of the offence.</P>
<P>Now it appears from the above authori|ties, that if bail is to be taken at all for a libel, which con&s;idered as an offence, is not a <HI>breach of the peace,</HI> but only a mi&s;de|meanor, <HI>tending</HI> to a breach of it, that the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> bail, which the law allows in ca&s;es of trea&s;on and felony, is the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> that the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the court can legally demand
<PB N="51" REF="49">
for &s;uch a &s;pecies of mi&s;demeanor, particu|larly where the libel is again&s;t a private individual, not again&s;t a peer, or again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The bail demanded from Magee in the different actions for &s;lander has been &s;tated at the enormous &s;ums of four thou&s;and pounds, one thou&s;and pounds, eight hun|dred pounds, and two thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee if &s;uch demands be con&s;i&s;tent with the COMMON LAW.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee if it be prohited by the STA|TUTE LAW.</P>
<P>The&s;e two points may be examined to|gether.</P>
<P>The COMMON LAW lays it down, that ju&s;tices mu&s;t take care, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Hawk p. c. 89.</NOTE> that under pretence of demanding <HI>&s;ufficient &s;urety,</HI> they do not make &s;o <HI>exce&s;&s;ive a demand,</HI> as in effect to amount to a <HI>denial of bail.</HI> And in &s;upport
<PB N="52" REF="50">
of this doctrine, a long &s;tring of ca&s;es might be produed, a few however will be &s;uffi|cient, as the great principles of bail are to be found in the <HI>petition of rights,</HI> and <HI>the habeas corpus act.</HI> But it is to be ob|&s;erved, that in tho&s;e ca&s;es, even where the offences charged upon the defendant have been enormous, as actions for Mayhem, for violent and cruel batteries, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Barnes Notes 76. 191.</NOTE> for malicious pro&s;ecutions, &amp;c. no bail has been demand|ed, that bears the lea&s;t proportion to the &s;malle&s;t &s;um demanded from Magee.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the old acts cited in p. 36, 37. Stat. 1. Wm. and Mary c. 2.</NOTE> The STATUTE LAW, after recognizing the oppre&s;&s;ions of a tyrannical government, prohibits the demand of exce&s;&s;ive bail as a <HI>grievance;</HI> and it was one of tho&s;e com|plained of by the people, and provided again&s;t by the legi&s;lature at the revolution, in the ever memorable bill of rights.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid the bill of rights only re|&s;pects criminal pro&s;ecutions; the an&s;wer is, it is a &s;tatute declaratory of the common law, but if it was not, acts of parliament &s;hall be taken with <HI>latitude,</HI> and extended

Now whatever <HI>rea&s;on</HI> can be &s;hewn again&s;t demanding exce&s;&s;ive bail on criminal pro&s;ecutions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plowd. 147.</NOTE> acquires &s;trength when applied again&s;t &s;uch a demand, <NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ton v.

<P><PB N="54" REF="52">In England, the principles of the&s;e &s;tatutes have been con&s;tantly kept alive. LORD MANS|FIELD, well knew, that the &s;pirited people of that country, were more tenacious of the &s;acred privileges of per&s;on, than of any other right or liberty the con&s;titution gives them, and therefore his lord&s;hip always &s;et his face again&s;t <HI>exce&s;&s;ive bail,</HI> and again&s;t <HI>exce&s;&s;ive damages.</HI></P>
<P>When MR. LAURENS, the American, was brought before the court of King's-Bench, on a charge of high trea&s;on, his friends made a voluntary tender of one hundred thou&s;and pounds bail. Lord Mansfield refu&s;|ed to receive &s;uch bail, which he termed enormous, and con&s;idered uncon&s;titutional, and ordered the recognizance to be made out for &s;uch a &s;um, as was proportioned to the offence charged upon the pri&s;oner, his rank, and &s;ituation in life.</P>
<P>The opinion of Mr Attorney General of Ireland (Wolfe) delivered in the hou&s;e of commons, on Mr. Pon&s;onby's motion, co-in|cides with that of Lord Mansfield, in the
<PB N="55" REF="53">
ca&s;e of Mr. Laurens; That learned gentle|man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">News pa|per report of the de|bate.</NOTE> then declared, "that he did not think a <HI>man's ability to give large bail was a ju&s;tification for demanding it."</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>In SIR THOMAS RUMBOLD'S ca&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Parl. Reg. of Eng. 1782. by De|brett.</NOTE> a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons, by Mr. Henry Dunda&s;s, then lord advocate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to re&s;train Sir Thomas from di&s;|po&s;ing of his property, by holding him to bail, in the &s;um of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lawyers, were rouzed at this uncon&s;titutional requi&s;ition of the <HI>Scotch</HI> ad|vocate.&mdash;</P>
<P>The ATTORNEY GENERAL &s;aid, it was a hard ca&s;e to impound a man's whole e&s;tate merely that he &s;hould not fly from ju&s;tice. <NOTE PLACE="marg">See defi|nition of bail ante.</NOTE> The demanding of enormous bail he reprobated in the mo&s;t pointed terms, as amounting in reality to ab&s;olute impri&s;onment; becau&s;e no man under &s;uch a rule of bail, could <HI>indemnify others to become</HI> &s;ecurity for him.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="54">The SOLICITOR GENERAL argued on the &s;ame points. He in&s;i&s;ted that the demand was contrary to the <HI>practice of the courts below;</HI> and that to exact exce&s;&s;ive bail was a breach of the con&s;titution. The law condemned &s;uch bail as being cruel, by inflicting pu|ni&s;hment on the innocent&mdash;by impri&s;oning before conviction, men who could procure rea&s;onable bail to enlarge them till the day of trial.</P>
<P>MR. HASTINGS, impeached for high crimes and mi&s;demeanors, by the hou&s;e of com|mons in the name of the people of Great Britain, was only held to ten thou&s;and pounds bail, though there could be no doubt of his capability to procure bail to any amount.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced then it is clear,</P>
<P>That the <HI>judicial di&s;cretion</HI> of judges, is circum&s;cribed and bound by the rules of law and &s;ound rea&s;on,</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="55">That bail can not be demanded on acti|ons for &s;lander, except in ca&s;es of &s;canda|lum magnatum or &s;lander of title,</P>
<P>That in all ca&s;es where fiats are grant|able there mu&s;t be a po&s;itive affidavit of the cau&s;e of action and of the &s;pecific damages &s;uffered by the defendant,</P>
<P>That the bail demanded in the ca&s;e of Magee was exce&s;&s;ive, and,</P>
<P>That in civil as well as in criminal ac|tions, a demand of EXCESSIVE BAIL is ILLEGAL.</P>
<P>N. B. The writer of this e&s;&s;ay was not pre&s;ent, at the arguments in the court of King's-Bench, in any of the cau&s;es again&s;t Magee; nor was he in the hou&s;e of com|mons, when the que&s;tion of fiats and bail came before the repre&s;entatives of the na|tion. Of the proceedings in the King's-Bench he has &s;een no report. Of the arguments in the hou&s;e of commons, he has &s;een only a new&s;paper account, which however, tho'

probably taken down with inaccuracy, and printed in ha&s;te, di&s;plays great con&s;titutional and legal abilities.
