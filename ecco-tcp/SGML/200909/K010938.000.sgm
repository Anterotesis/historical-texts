<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tragedy, here offered to the Public, is founded on a pa&s;&s;age in VALERIUS MAXIMUS<NOTE PLACE="foot">Vide Valer. Max. lib. 5, c. 4, <HI>de Pictate in Parentes.</HI> 7.</NOTE>. We are told by that Author, <Q>That a woman of ingenuous birth was convicted before the PRAETOR of a capital crime, and delivered over to the TRIUMVIR to be put to death in pri&s;on. The jailer received her into his cu&s;tody, but, touched with compa&s;&s;ion, did not proceed immediately to execute the &s;entence. His humanity went &s;o far as to admit the daughter of the unhappy criminal into the goal; but not without a previous &s;earch, left any nouri&s;hment &s;hould be &s;ecretly conveyed. To &s;tarve the pri&s;oner to death was his de&s;ign. Several days pa&s;&s;ed, when it became a matter of wonder how the poor woman &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long. The jailer's curio&s;ity was excited: he watched the daughter narrowly, and &s;aw her give her brea&s;t to the fami&s;hed mother, and with her milk &s;upply the cravings of nature. Touched by the novelty of &s;o affecting a &s;ight, he made his report to the TRIUMVIR, from whom it reached the PRAETOR, and, the whole matter being referred to the JUDICIAL MAGISTRATES, the mother received a free pardon. What will not filial piety undertake?&mdash;What place will it not penetrate?&mdash;What will it not devi&s;e, when in a dungeon it finds unheard of means to pre&s;erve a parent's life?&mdash;Is there in the cour&s;e of human affairs, a &s;cene &s;o big with wonder, as a mother nouri&s;hed at the daughter's brea&s;t?&mdash;The incident might, at the fir&s;t view, be thought repugnant to the order of nature, if TO LOVE OUR PARENTS were not the FIRST LAW &s;tamped by the hand of Nature on the human heart.</Q> Thus far VALERIUS MAXIMUS. He goes on in the &s;ame place, and tells a Greek tale, in which the heroine performs the fame act of piety to a father in the decline of life. For the purpo&s;es of the drama, the latter &s;tory has been preferred. The painters long &s;ince &s;eized the &s;ubject,
<PB REF="80">
and by them it has been called ROMAN CHARITY. The Author has taken the liberty to place it in the reign of DIONYSIUS the Younger, at the point of time when TIMOLEON laid &s;iege to SYRACUSE. The general effect, it was thought, would be better produced, if the whole had an air of real hi&s;tory.</P>
<Q><L>Atque ita mentitur, &s;ic veris fal&s;a remi&s;cet,</L>
<L>Primo ne medium, medio ne di&s;crepet imum.</L></Q>
<P>The Author does not wi&s;h to conceal that the &s;ubject of his Tragedy has been touched in &s;ome foreign pieces: but he thinks it has been <HI>only</HI> touched. The ZELMIRE of Mon&s;. BELLOY begins after the daughter has delivered her father out of pri&s;on. The play indeed has many beauties; and if the &s;entiments and bu&s;ine&s;s of that piece coincided with the de&s;ign of THE GRECIAN DAUGHTER, the Author would not have blu&s;hed to tread in his &s;teps. But a new fable was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: and, perhaps, in the pre&s;ent humour of the times, it is not unlucky that no more than three lines could be adopted from Mon&s;. BELLOY. Every writer, who makes up a &s;tory with characters and incidents already hackneyed on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, and invents nothing, cries out with an air of triumph, That he has not borrowed from the wits of FRANCE. In the I&s;le of Man, it is &s;aid, there is an epitaph in the&s;e words: <HI>"He who lies here interred, was never out of this i&s;land."</HI> The poor man was to be pitied: a &s;imilar inscription upon the tomb-&s;tone of a modern poet would, perhaps, do as little honour to the memory of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Author cannot di&s;mi&s;s his Play, without declaring, that, though in love with the &s;ubject, he has not &s;atisfied even his own ideas of the drama: he laments that he had neither time nor ability to make it better. To heighten it with additional beauties was re&s;erved for the decorations with which the zeal of Mr. GARRICK has embelli&s;hed the repre&s;entation; for the admirable performance of Mr. BARRY, and, above all, for the enchanting powers and the genius of Mrs. BARRY.</P>
