<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of India is laid, with great humility, at the foot
of the throne. As no incon&s;iderable part of Hindo&s;tan, is now in a manner
comprehended within the circle of the Briti&s;h empire, there is a propriety in
addre&s;&s;ing the hi&s;tory of that country to the Sovereign.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of your Maje&s;ty's arms has laid open the Ea&s;t
to the re&s;earches of the curious; and your gracious accept|ance of this
fir&s;t, though &s;mall &s;pecimen of the literature of A&s;ia, will excite men
of greater abilities than the pre&s;ent tran&s;lator po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, to
&s;tudy the annals of a people, remark|able for their antiquity, civilization,
and the &s;ingular cha|racter of their religion and manners.</P>
<P> <PB REF="5"> In the hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan, now offered to your
Maje&s;ty, the people of Great-Britain may &s;ee a &s;triking contra&s;t of
their own condition; and, whil&s;t they feel for human na|ture &s;uffering
under de&s;poti&s;m, exult at the &s;ame time, in that happy liberty, which
they enjoy under the government of a Prince who delights in augmenting the
&s;ecurity and felicity of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>That your Maje&s;ty may long remain a public ble&s;&s;ing, and
reign for a &s;eries of many years over this happy nation, is the &s;incere

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE tran&s;lator of the following hi&s;tory of the Mahom|medan
empire in Hindo&s;tan, having in a military capacity re&s;ided for &s;ome time
in the kingdom of Bengal, dedicated the mo&s;t of his lei&s;ure hours to the
&s;tudy of the oriental languages. The Per&s;ian tongue being the mo&s;t
po|lite and learned, as well as the mo&s;t univer&s;ally under&s;tood in
A&s;ia, engaged his principal attention.</P>
<P>The intimate connection which the Briti&s;h nation now have, with
a part of Hindo&s;tan, renders the knowledge of the country languages of great
importance to the &s;ervants of the public in that part of the world. The
tran&s;lator, who had extended his views in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion,
thought it &s;o capital a point for him, that he per&s;evered for &s;ome years,
in that dry and difficult &s;tudy, and incurred a very con&s;iderable expence,
in retaining ma&s;ters, and in procuring manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>Though to qualify him&s;elf for action, and negotiation in India,
was the primary object of the tran&s;lator, yet in pro|portion as he advanced
in his &s;tudies, other motives for his continuing them aro&s;e. He found, that
however different the manner of the ea&s;tern writers may be from the correct 
<PB N="ii" REF="11"> ta&s;te of Europe, there are many things in their works
worthy of the attention of literary men. Their poetry it is true is too turgid
and florid, and the diction of their hi&s;torians too diffu&s;e and verbo&s;e.
Yet in the fir&s;t we meet with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages truly elegant and
&s;ublime; and amid&s;t the redun|dancy of the latter, there appears
&s;ometimes a nervou&s;ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and a manline&s;s of
&s;entiment, which might do honour to any hi&s;torical genius in the
we&s;t.</P>
<P>Locked up in the difficulties of the Per&s;ian tongue, the
literature of A&s;ia has been hitherto little known in Europe. From an
ignorance &s;o unpardonable in this inve&s;tigating age, a very unfavourable
idea has prevailed concerning the learn|ing, as well as hi&s;tory, of the
ea&s;tern nations. Full of pre|judices &s;o natural to an European, the
tran&s;lator entered upon the &s;tudy of the oriental languages. Whatever aid a
knowledge of them might give to his private views, he little hoped to be able
to convert his &s;tudies to the amu&s;ement or in&s;truction of the public. To
tran&s;late &s;ome piece of hi&s;tory, was, by his teachers, recommended to him
as a proper exerci&s;e in the Per&s;ian. The works of Mahummud Ca&s;im
Feri&s;hta of Delhi, who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Jehangire, about the
beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, was put into his hands for that
purpo&s;e. As he advanced, a greater field gradually opened before him. He
found, with &s;ome degree of a&s;toni&s;hment, the minute and authentic
hi&s;tory of a great empire, the name of which had &s;carcely ever travelled to
Europe.</P>
<P>To open a door to the literary trea&s;ures, which lay con|cealed
in the ob&s;curity of the Per&s;ian, the tran&s;lator re&s;olved to proceed in
his ver&s;ion of Feri&s;hta's hi&s;tory, and to give it <PB N="iii" REF="12">
to the public as a &s;mall &s;pecimen of what men of greater abilities may
hereafter meet with in that language. But before he had fully accompli&s;hed
this de&s;ign, injuries in rank, and other motives, forced him to quit the
company's &s;ervice, and to return to England. Being, at his departure from
India, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only of one volume of the original, he has been
obliged to confine him&s;elf to it; and to leave the &s;econd volume, which
contains the particular hi&s;tories of the Decan, Bengal, Guzerat, and
Ca&s;hmire, to a more favoura|ble opportunity, or to the employment of &s;ome
other hand. This circum&s;tance has occa&s;ioned &s;ome cha&s;ms in that part
of the hi&s;tory which is now given to the public; and many material
tran&s;actions of tho&s;e nations, of whom Feri&s;hta in his &s;econd volume
treats, are only &s;lightly mentioned.</P>
<P>The reigns of the Mogul Emperors, from Akbar, with whom our author
concludes his general hi&s;tory, have been written by different hi&s;torians.
But &s;o voluminous are tho&s;e works, that to attempt a tran&s;lation, would
be a laborious and very tedious ta&s;k. Since the days of Feri&s;hta, no writer
that has come to our knowledge, has abridged the hi&s;tory of India, and
therefore the tran&s;lator had formed a de&s;ign to compile from various
authors that very e&s;&s;ential part of the hi&s;tory of the Mogul empire,
which is not comprehended in the following tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>With a view to accompli&s;h this undertaking, the tran&s;la|tor,
who had been honoured with the particular friend&s;hip of the pre&s;ent Mogul,
applied in per&s;on to that Prince, for &s;uch books, and authentic records, as
were nece&s;&s;ary to com|pleat the Hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan. The King approved
very <PB N="iv" REF="13"> much of his de&s;ign, and gave orders to his
&s;ecretary to grant his reque&s;t. But in the mean time the tran&s;lator
quitted the &s;ervice, and retired to Calcutta. To revive however his
Maje&s;ty's memory upon that &s;ubject, he wrote to him; and as the manner of
writing to ea&s;tern Princes may afford mat|ter of &s;ome curio&s;ity to the
public, we &s;hall here give a lite|ral tran&s;lation of the letter.</P>
<Q> 
<P>To the audience of the admitted into the pre&s;ence of the
trea&s;ury of liberality, and beneficence: To the &s;age director of the ways
of truth, the Kibla<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The point to which the Mahommedans
turn their faces when they pray.</NOTE> of the world, and the a&s;ylum of the
inhabitants of the univer&s;e, who&s;e kingdom and re|nown la&s;t for ever, it
is mo&s;t humbly pre&s;ented;</P> 
<P>That a &s;ervant, nouri&s;hed by their<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is an invariable cu&s;tom among the Ea&s;tern nations, to
addre&s;s crowned heads in the third per&s;on plural, while the writer
him&s;elf always u&s;es the third per&s;on in the &s;ingular number.</NOTE>
bounty, having, from their &s;plendid pre&s;ence, obtained leave of departure,
hath now reached the city of Calcutta, where, retired from the noi&s;e of
public affairs, he prays for their Maje&s;ty's wel|fare.</P> 
<P>Moved by a grateful remembrance of their royal favour, warmed by
the fame, ju&s;tice, and glorious exploits and con|que&s;ts of the emperors of
the paradi&s;iacal regions of Hindo&s;tan; but more particularly excited by the
renown of the imperial hou&s;e of Timur<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Timur,
who in Europe is, by corruption, called Tamerlane, has always conferred upon
him the title of Saib Kirren, or lord of the periods. Kirren, of which Kiran is
the plural, &s;ignifies a period of thirty years. The long reign of Timur gave
ri&s;e to his title.</NOTE>, lord of ages! And al&s;o by a de&s;ire to gratify 
<PB N="v" REF="14"> the curio&s;ity of di&s;tant nations, with the great
actions of a &s;plen|did dyna&s;ty of Kings, he has dared to a&s;pire to
tran&s;late the hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan, from the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic
Per&s;ian authors, into the Engli&s;h language, now &s;trong, learned and
univer&s;al.</P> 
<P>From the fir&s;t ri&s;ing of the &s;tar of the faith, upon the&s;e
paradi&s;iacal plains, unto the end of the glorious reign of ARSH ASTANI
MAHUMMUD AKBAR, King, the hi&s;tory of Empire has been already penned: but,
from that period to the pre|&s;ent time, materials have been wanting to their
Maje&s;ty's &s;ervant: he therefore breathes in hope, that their &s;ublime
Maje&s;ty will &s;ignify their royal plea&s;ure to the RAI RAIAN, chief
&s;ecretary of the illu&s;trious pre&s;ence, to &s;upply their &s;ervant with
&s;uch books and authentic records, as are nece&s;|&s;ary to accompli&s;h his
great de&s;ign. Thus &s;hall the glory of their renown &s;hine forth to
European eyes, with that &s;plendor, which, from the firmament of empire, hath
hi|therto enlightened the Ea&s;t.</P> </Q>
<P>The government of the pre&s;idency of Bengal, have of late, in
&s;ome particulars, imbibed the political principles of the Ea&s;t; for all
private corre&s;pondence with any of the country powers is &s;trictly
prohibited. The above letter was di&s;patched by the tran&s;lator to a friend
at Allahabad, the pre&s;ent re&s;idence of the Emperor, with a reque&s;t to
deliver it in per&s;on to that prince. But whether afraid of his &s;u|periors,
or guilty of an unaccountable neglect, that gen|tleman returned to Calcutta
without pre&s;enting the letter to the Mogul. The tran&s;lator forwarded it a
&s;econd time to Allahabad, but before an an&s;wer could be received from &s;o 
<PB N="vi" REF="15"> great a di&s;tance, he was obliged, after having waited
for the la&s;t &s;hip in the &s;ea&s;on, to embark for Europe.</P>
<P>Though our author Mahummud Ca&s;im Feri&s;hta has given the title
of the Hi&s;tory of Hindo&s;tan to his work, yet it is ra|ther that of the
Mahommedan empire in India, than a gene|ral account of the affairs of the
Hindoos. What he &s;ays concerning India, prior to the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of
the Afgan Mu&s;&s;ulmen, is very far from being &s;atisfactory. He collected
his accounts from Per&s;ian authors, being altogether unac|quainted with the
Shan&s;crita or learned language of the Brahmins, in which the internal
hi&s;tory of India is compre|hended. We mu&s;t not therefore, with Feri&s;hta,
con&s;ider the Hindoos as de&s;titute of genuine dome&s;tic annals, or that
tho&s;e voluminous records they po&s;&s;e&s;s are mere legends framed by the
Brahmins.</P>
<P>The prejudices of the Mahommedans again&s;t the follow|ers of the
Brahmin religion, &s;eldom permits them to &s;peak with common candour of the
Hindoos. It &s;wayed very much with Feri&s;hta when he affirmed, that there is
no hi&s;|tory among the Hindoos of better authority than the Maha|barit. That
work is a poem and not a hi&s;tory: It was tran&s;|lated into Per&s;ian by the
brother of the great Abul Fazil, rather as a performance of fancy, than as an
authentic account of the ancient dyna&s;ties of the Kings of India. But that
there are many hundred volumes in pro&s;e in the Shan|&s;crita language, which
treat of the ancient Indians, the tran&s;lator can, from his own knowledge,
aver, and he has great rea&s;on to believe, that the Hindoos carry their
authen|tic hi&s;tory farther back into antiquity, than any other nation now
exi&s;ting.</P>
<P> <PB N="vii" REF="16"> The Mahommedans know nothing of the Hindoo
learn|ing: and had they even any knowledge of the hi&s;tory of the followers of
Brimha, their prejudices in favour of the jewi&s;h fictions contained in the
Koran, would make them reject accounts, which tend to &s;ubvert the &s;y&s;tem
of their own faith. The Shan&s;crita records contain accounts of the affairs of
the we&s;tern A&s;ia, very different from what any tribe of the Arabians have
tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity: and it is more than probable, that upon
examination, the former will appear to bear the marks of more authenticity, and
of greater antiquity than the latter.</P>
<P>But whether the Hindoos po&s;&s;e&s;s any true hi&s;tory of
greater antiquity than other nations, mu&s;t altogether re&s;t upon the
authority of the Brahmins, till we &s;hall become better ac|quainted with their
records. Their preten&s;ions however are very high, and they confidently
affirm, that the Jewi&s;h and Mahommedan religions are here&s;ies, from what is
contained in the Bedas. They give a very particular account of the origin of
the Jewi&s;h religion in records of undoubted anti|quity. Raja Tura, &s;ay
they, who is placed in the fir&s;t ages of the Cal Jug, had a &s;on who
apo&s;tatized from the Hindoo faith, for which he was bani&s;hed by his father
to the We&s;t. The apo&s;tate fixed his re&s;idence in a country called Mohgod,
and propagated the Jewi&s;h religion, which the impo&s;tor Mahommed further
corrupted. The Cal Jug commenced about 4885 years ago, and whether the whole
&s;tory may not relate to Terah and his &s;on Abraham, is a point which we will
leave to others to determine.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance which goes far to prove that there is
&s;ome connection between the Brahmin Bedas and the <PB N="viii" REF="17">
doctrines contained in the Old Te&s;tament. Ever &s;ince the promulgation of
the religion of Mahommed, which is founded upon Mo&s;es and the Prophets, the
Brahmins have totally rejected their fourth Beda called the Obatar Bah, as the
&s;chi&s;m of Mahommed, according to them, has been founded upon that book.
However extraordinary this rea|&s;on is for rejecting the fourth part of their
religious records, it can &s;carcely be doubted, as it is in the mouth of every
Brahmin.</P>
<P>Feizi, the brother of Abul Fazil the hi&s;torian, was the only
Mu&s;&s;ulman we ever heard of, who under&s;tood the Shan&s;crita. The
fraudulent means by which he acquired it, will be &s;hewn in another place. He
never tran&s;lated any of the Indian hi&s;tories, excepting the Mahabarit,
which, at be&s;t, is but an hi&s;torical poem, in which a great deal of fable
is blended with a little truth. We, upon the whole, cannot much depend upon the
accounts which the followers of Mahommed give of the religion and ancient
hi&s;tory of the Hindoos: Their prejudice makes them mi&s;repre&s;ent the
former, and their ignorance in the Shan&s;crita language, has totally excluded
them from any knowledge of the latter.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Ca&s;im Feri&s;hta being an abridgment of a
variety of authors, who wrote di&s;tinct accounts of the diffe|rent reigns of
the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindo&s;tan, he, with a view to comprehend in a
&s;mall compa&s;s, every mate|rial tran&s;action, has crowded the events too
much together, without inter&s;per&s;ing them with tho&s;e reflections which
give &s;pirit and elegance to works of this kind: This defect &s;eems however
to have proceeded more from a &s;tudied brevity, than <PB N="ix" REF="18"> from
a narrowne&s;s of genius in Feri&s;hta. Upon &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions, e&s;pecially
in the characters of the princes, he &s;hews a &s;trength of judgment, and a
nervou&s;ne&s;s and conci&s;ene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion which would do no
di&s;honour to the be&s;t wri|ters in the we&s;t. What is really remarkable in
this writer is, that he &s;eems as much dive&s;ted of religious prejudices, as
he is of political flattery or fear. He never pa&s;&s;es a good action without
conferring upon it its due reward of prai&s;e, nor a bad one, let the
villainous actor be never &s;o high, without &s;tigmatizing it with infamy. In
&s;hort, if he does not arrive at the character of a good writer, he certainly
de&s;erves that of a good man.</P>
<P>The brevity which we cen&s;ure in Feri&s;hta, is by no means a
common fault in the writers of A&s;ia. Redundant and ver|bo&s;e in their
diction, they often regard more the cadence and turn of their &s;entences, than
the propriety and ele|gance of their thoughts; leading frequently the reader
into a labyrinth to which he can find no end. This is too much the manner of
the learned Abul Fazil him&s;elf. He wrote the hi&s;tory of the reign of Akbar
in two large volumes in folio. The intrigues of the court, and all the &s;ecret
motives to action are inve&s;tigated with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s; but the
diction is too diffu&s;e, and the language too florid for the correct ta&s;te
of Europe.</P>
<P>It ought here to be remarked, that all the oriental hi&s;to|rians
write, in what they call in Europe, poetical pro&s;e. This fal&s;e ta&s;te only
commenced about five centuries ago, when literature declined in A&s;ia, with
the power of the Caliphs. The tran&s;lator has now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
books written in the Per&s;ian before that period, the diction of 
<PB N="x" REF="19"> which, is as conci&s;e and manly, as that which de&s;cended
from Greece and Rome, to the writers of modern Europe. The learned and
celebrated Abul Fazil, in&s;tead of correcting this vicious ta&s;te, encouraged
it greatly by his florid man|ner, in his hi&s;tory of the reign of Akbar. But
this great writer has, notwith&s;tanding his circumlocutions, cloathed his
expre&s;&s;ions with &s;uch beauty and pomp of eloquence, that he &s;eems to
come down upon the a&s;toni&s;hed reader, like the Ganges in the rainy
&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;mall progre&s;s which correctne&s;s and elegance of
&s;en|timent and diction has made in the Ea&s;t, did not proceed from a want of
encouragement to literature. We &s;hall find in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory,
that no princes in the world patroni&s;ed men of letters with more genero&s;ity
and re&s;pect, than the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindo&s;tan. A literary genius
was not only the certain means to acquire a degree of wealth which mu&s;t
a&s;toni&s;h Europeans, but an infallible road for ri&s;ing to the fir&s;t
offices of the &s;tate. The character of the learned, was at the &s;ame time
&s;o &s;acred, that tyrants, who made a pa&s;time of embruing their hands in
the blood of their other &s;ubjects, not only ab&s;tained from offering
violence to men of genius, but &s;tood in fear of their pens. It is a proverb
in the Ea&s;t, that the Monarchs of A&s;ia were more afraid of the pen of Abul
Fazil, than they were of the &s;word of Akbar; and, however amazing it may
&s;eem in ab|&s;olute governments, it is certain that the hi&s;torians of that
divi&s;ion of the world, have wrote with more freedom con|cerning per&s;ons and
things, than writers have ever dared to do in the We&s;t.</P>
<P> <PB N="xi" REF="20"> The tran&s;lator, however, being
&s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of poetical diction, in the grave narration of
hi&s;torical facts, has, in many places, clipped the wings of Feri&s;hta's
turgid expre&s;&s;ions, and reduced his metaphors into common language, without
however &s;werving in the lea&s;t from the original meaning of the author.</P>
<P>A frequent repetition of proper names is unavoidable in a work of
&s;uch brevity, and &s;o much crouded with action. This will perhaps appear the
mo&s;t glaring defect in the work: but to u&s;e the pronouns too often, would
have rendered the &s;en&s;e more perplexed, and the narration le&s;s elegant
and di&s;tinct. The tran&s;lator, in &s;hort, cho&s;e to give the faults of his
author to the public as they &s;tood, rather than by an attempt to a|mend them,
to &s;ub&s;titute perhaps &s;ome of his own in their place.</P>
<P>Our author with great propriety begins the hi&s;tory of the Patan
empire in Hindo&s;tan, from the commencement of the kingdom of Ghizni. The
Mahommedan govern|ment, which afterwards extended it&s;elf to Hindo&s;tan,
ro&s;e originally from very &s;mall beginnings among the mountains which divide
Per&s;ia from India. The Afgans or Patans, a warlike race of men, who had been
&s;ubjects of the va&s;t empire of Bochara, revolted under their governor
Abi&s;tagi, in the fourth century of the Higera, and laid the foundation of the
empire of Ghizni, known commonly in Europe, by the name of Gazna. Under a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of war|like princes, this empire ro&s;e to a &s;urpri&s;ing
magnitude. We find that in the reign of Mu&s;aood, in the beginning of the
fifth century of the Higera, it extended from I&s;pahan to Bengal, and from the
mouths of the Indus to the banks <PB N="xii" REF="21"> of the Jaxartes, which
comprehends near half of the great continent of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Mu&s;aood, the Charizmian empire aro&s;e
on the confines of Per&s;ia and great Tartary. It ex|tended it&s;elf over
Tartary and the greate&s;t part of the Per&s;ian provinces; the Kings of the
Ghiznian Patans were obliged to relinqui&s;h their dominions in the north, and
to transfer the &s;eat of their empire to Lahore, and afterwards to Delhi.</P>
<P>When the great conqueror of A&s;ia Zingis Chan, invaded and
&s;ubverted the Charizmian empire under Mahummud Shaw, the Patan dominions were
entirely confined within the limits of Hindo&s;tan. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
however power &s;uf|ficient to repel the generals of that great man, though
flu&s;hed with victory and the &s;poils of the Ea&s;t. The whole force of
Zingis, it is true, was never bent again&s;t Hindo&s;tan, otherwi&s;e it is
probable it would have &s;hared the fate of the we&s;tern A&s;ia, which was
almo&s;t depopulated by his &s;word.</P>
<P>The uncommon &s;trength of the Patan empire in Hindo&s;|tan at
this period, may be ea&s;ily accounted for: It was the policy of the adopted
Turki&s;h &s;laves of the family of Ghor, who then held the kingdom of Delhi,
to keep &s;tanding armies of the mountain Afgans, under their re&s;pective
chiefs, who were invariably created Omrahs of the empire. This hardy race,
whatever dome&s;tic confu&s;ions and revo|lutions they might occa&s;ion in
India, were, to u&s;e Feri&s;hta's words, a wall of iron again&s;t foreign
enemies.</P>
<P> <PB N="xiii" REF="22"> Our author has not been careful to mark
the extent of the Empire in every reign. We can only form a general idea of it,
from the tran&s;actions which he records. The Empire we find &s;ometimes
reduced to a few di&s;tricts round the capital, and at other times, extending
it&s;elf from the bay of Bengal to Per&s;ia, and from the Carnatic to the great
mountains of Sewalic. In &s;hort, the boundaries of the Pa|tan imperial
dominions, varied in proportion to the abilities of tho&s;e princes who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne. When the mo|narchs di&s;covered great parts, the
governors of provinces &s;hrunk back from their independance into their former
&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; but when a weak Prince &s;at on the Mu&s;nud, his
lieutenants &s;tarted up into Kings around him.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory now given to the public, pre&s;ents us with a
&s;triking picture of the deplorable condition of a people &s;ubjected to
arbitrary &s;way; and of the in&s;tability of empire it&s;elf, when it is
founded neither upon laws, nor upon the opinions and attachments of mankind.
Hindo&s;tan, in every age, was an ample field for private ambition, and for
public tyranny. At one time we &s;ee a petty Omrah &s;tarting forth, and wading
through an ocean of blood to the crown, or involving many thou&s;ands of
indigent adventurers in the ruin which he draws upon his own head. At another
time we meet with Kings, from a lu&s;t of power which de|feats it&s;elf,
de&s;troying tho&s;e &s;ubjects over whom they only wi&s;hed to tyrannize.</P>
<P>In a government like that of India, public &s;pirit is never
&s;een, and loyalty is a thing unknown. The people permit them&s;elves to be
transferred from one tyrant to another, without murmuring; and individuals look
with unconcern <PB N="xiv" REF="23"> upon the mi&s;eries of others, if they are
capable to &s;creen them&s;elves from the general misfortune. This, however, is
a picture of Hindo&s;tan in bad times, and under the wor&s;t Kings. As
arbitrary government can inflict the mo&s;t &s;udden mi&s;eries, &s;o, when in
the hands of good men, it can admi|ni&s;ter the mo&s;t expeditious relief to
the &s;ubject. We accord|ingly find in this hi&s;tory, that the misfortunes of
half an age of tyranny, are removed in a few years, under the mild
admini&s;tration of a virtuous prince.</P>
<P>It may not be improper in this place, to lay before the public, a
&s;hort &s;ketch of the con&s;titution of Hindo&s;tan. The Emperor is
ab&s;olute and &s;ole arbiter in every thing, and is controlled by no law. The
lives and properties of the great|e&s;t Omrahs are as much at his di&s;po&s;al,
as tho&s;e of the mean|e&s;t &s;ubjects. The former however are often too
powerful to be puni&s;hed, while the latter are not only &s;laves to the King,
but to the provincial governors. The&s;e governors, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of Nabobs, have in their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions, the power of life
and death, and are, in every particular, inve&s;ted with regal authority.</P>
<P>All the lands in India are con&s;idered as the property of the
King, except &s;ome hereditary di&s;tricts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Hin|doo
Princes, for which, when the Empire was in its vigour, they paid annual
tributes, but retained an ab&s;olute juri&s;diction in their own hands. The
King is the general heir of all his &s;ubjects; but when there are children to
inherit, they are &s;eldom deprived of their father's e&s;tate, without the
fortune is enormous, and has been ama&s;&s;ed in the oppre&s;&s;ive govern|ment
of a province. In a ca&s;e of this kind, the children, or neare&s;t relations,
are allowed a certain proportion for their <PB N="xv" REF="24">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance, at the di&s;cretion of the Ca&s;y or judge. The for|tunes of
merchants, trade&s;men, and mechanics, are never confi&s;cated by the crown, if
any children or relations remain.</P>
<P>The King has the extraordinary power of nominating his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or by will. This part of royal prerogative is not pe|culiar to the
monarchs of Hindo&s;tan. We find that our own nation, &s;o remarkable for their
political freedom, were, not above two centuries ago, made over like a private
e&s;tate, and that with their own con&s;ent, by the will of a Prince, who
neither de&s;erved to be beloved nor admired. Accord|ing to the opinion of the
Indians, the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is ve&s;ted in the male heir, but the
la&s;t will of the King very often &s;uper&s;edes this idea of ju&s;tice.
Notwith&s;tanding this prejudice in favour of the fir&s;t born, there is no
di&s;|tinction made between natural children and tho&s;e born in lawful
wedlock; for every child brought forth in the Ha|ram, whether by wives or
concubines, are equally legiti|mate.</P>
<P>The vizier is generally fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate. All edicts
and public deeds mu&s;t pa&s;s under his &s;eal, after the royal &s;ignet is
affixed to them. The Vizier's office con&s;i&s;ts of va|rious departments, in
every one of which all commi&s;&s;ions, patents for honorary titles, and grants
for Jagiers, are care|fully regi&s;tered. He &s;uperintends the royal
exchequer, and, in that capacity, keeps accounts with the Dewans of the
&s;eve|ral provinces, in every thing which regards the finances.</P>
<P>A Vakiel Mutuluck is &s;ometimes appointed by the King. The power
of this officer is &s;uperior to that of the Vizier, for he not only has the
&s;uperintendency of civil, but al&s;o of <PB N="xvi" REF="25"> all military
affairs. This la&s;t is never any part of the Vizier's office; the Amir ul
Omrah, or Bux&s;hi, being independent captain-general, and payma&s;ter of the
forces. It is not ea&s;y to explain to Europeans the full extent of authority
conferred upon the Vakiel Mutuluck; he &s;eems to be an officer to whom the
King for a time delegates his whole power, re|&s;erving only for him&s;elf the
imperial title, and en&s;igns of royalty.</P>
<P>The Emperor of Hindo&s;tan gives public audience twice a day from
the throne. All petitioners, without di&s;tinction, are, after having gone
through the u&s;ual ceremonies, admitted. They are permitted to pre&s;ent their
written complaints to the Ariz Beg, or lord of the reque&s;ts, who attends, in
order to pre&s;ent them to the King. The King reads them all him|&s;elf, and
&s;uper&s;cribes his plea&s;ure in a few words, with his own hand. Should any
thing in the petition appear doubt|ful, it is immediately referred to the
Sidder ul Suddur, who&s;e office an&s;wers to that of our chief ju&s;tice, to
be ex|amined and determined according to law.</P>
<P>The Mahommedans of Hindo&s;tan have no written laws, but tho&s;e
contained in the Koran. There are certain u&s;ages founded upon rea&s;on, and
immemorial cu&s;tom, which are al&s;o committed to writing. By the latter
&s;ome cau&s;es are determined, and there are officers appointed by the crown,
under the name of Canongoes, who, for a certain fee, ex|plain the written
u&s;ages to the people. In every di&s;trict or pergunnah, there is a cutchery,
or court of ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e courts are extremely venal, and
even the legal fees for determining a cau&s;e concerning property, is one
fourth of <PB N="xvii" REF="26"> the value of the matter in di&s;pute. Their
deci&s;ions were, how|ever, very expeditious; and through fear of the
di&s;plea&s;ure of the King, who invariably puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t
&s;everity corrupt judges, the Ca&s;ys were pretty equitable in their
deter|minations.</P>
<P>In the declining &s;tate of the Empire, the provinces were
&s;ubmitted to the management of Nabobs, or military gover|nors, who farmed the
revenues at a certain &s;um, and re&s;er|ved the overplus for their own u&s;e.
Originally the Nabobs were only commanders of the forces, who receiving their
orders from court, through the medium of the Dewan, a civil officer who
collected all the revenues for the King, paid the ju&s;t expences of the
government of the province, and remitted the &s;urplus to the exchequer. But
the Nabobs having the military power in their hands, de&s;pi&s;ed the
autho|rity of the Dewans, and purpo&s;ely fomented divi&s;ions, factions, and
in&s;urrections, that they might be indulged with great &s;tanding armies, to
make more money pa&s;s through their own hands, and to favour their &s;chemes
of independence.</P>
<P>The imbecility of the Empire daily increa&s;ing, the nomi|nal
authority ve&s;ted in the Dewan, was not &s;ufficient to con|tend with the real
force in the hands of the Nabob. Conti|nual altercations &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
between the&s;e officers in the pro|vince, and frequent complaints were
tran&s;mitted to court. Mini&s;ters who preferred pre&s;ent ea&s;e to the
future intere&s;t of the empire, curtailed the power of the Dewan, and, from
being in a manner the commander in chief of the province, he fell into the
&s;imple &s;uperintendency of the collections. <PB N="xviii" REF="27"> He had,
it is true, the power to prevent new impo&s;ts, and innovations in the law.</P>
<P>When the King took the field, the provincial Nabobs, with their
troops, were obliged to repair to the imperial &s;tandard. Each Nabob erected
his own &s;tandard, and formed a &s;eparate camp, &s;ubject only to his own
orders. The Na|bobs every morning attended at the royal pavilion, and re|ceived
their orders from the Amir ul Omrah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The
captain-general.</NOTE>, who received his immediately from the King him&s;elf.
If we except the army of the great Sultan Baber, there are few traces of real
di&s;cipline to be met with among tho&s;e myriads, with whom the Emperors of
Hindo&s;tan often took the field. The forces of Baber were formed on a very
regular and ma&s;terly plan. The di&s;po&s;itions of his battles were
excellent; and the &s;ur|prizing victories he obtained with a handful of men,
over immen&s;e armies, are &s;ufficient to convince us, that military
di&s;cipline has not always been unknown in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>It may to an European, furni&s;h matter of &s;ome &s;urprize, how
Ea&s;tern armies of two or three hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e, and triple that
number of &s;oldiers and followers, could be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and
forage upon their march, and in their &s;tanding camps. To account for this it
is to be ob|&s;erved, that every provincial Nabob, upon his taking the field,
appoints an officer called the Cutwal, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to
&s;uperintend the Bazars or markets, which may belong to his camp. Every
commander of a body of troops obtains at the &s;ame time, permi&s;&s;ion to
hoi&s;t a &s;lag for a Bazar, and to appoint a Cutwal of his own, under the
direction of the <PB N="xix" REF="28"> Cutwal-general. The&s;e Cutwals grant
licences to chapmen, &s;utlers, and corn dealers, who gladly pay a certain tax
for permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e of their various commodities, under the
protection of the different flags.</P>
<P>The &s;utlers and dealers in corn, being provided with a
&s;ufficient number of camels and oxen, collect provi&s;ions from all the
countries in their rear, and &s;upply the wants of the camp. The pay of
&s;oldiers in Hindo&s;tan is very great, being from 60 to 200 rupees per month,
to every &s;ingle trooper. This enables them to give &s;uch high prices for
provi&s;ions, that the countries round run all hazards for &s;uch a great
pro&s;pect of gain. The fertility of Hindo&s;tan it&s;elf, is the great
&s;ource of this ready and plentiful &s;upply to the armies; for that country
produces, in mo&s;t parts two, and &s;ometimes three crops of corn every
year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Indians &s;ometimes feed their hor&s;es
with a kind of vetch called Gram, which they boil. In want of that, they make a
&s;hift with the roots of gra&s;s, which they dig up and wa&s;h in water. This
they reckon better than hay. They are by this means never in want for forage,
in a country &s;o remarkable for vegetation. The hor&s;es al|ways belong to the
riders, which renders them more a&s;&s;iduous to keep them in proper order, as
their pay depends entirely on the goodne&s;s of their hor&s;es. But this is
attend|ed with a bad con&s;equence. A &s;oldier of fortune, who has nothing but
his hor&s;e to depend upon, is often afraid to expo&s;e him, where he would
perhaps ri&s;que his own life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected, that &s;omething concerning the
language of the tran&s;lation, &s;hould be &s;aid in this place. Employed from
his youth in a profe&s;&s;ion very different from that of letters, the
tran&s;lator a&s;pires not to the character of a fine writer. To expre&s;s his
author's meaning in a plain and unaffected diction, was all his de&s;ign; and
he expects the public will the more readily overlook any errors he may have
committed, that he neither hopes for much literary reputation, nor wi&s;hes for
any advantage from his work.</P>

<PB REF="29">
<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE Cu&s;toms, Manners, Language,
Religion and Philo&s;ophy of the HINDOOS.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned of modern Europe have, with rea&s;on, complained that
the writers of Greece and Rome did not extend their enquiries to the religion
and philo&s;ophy of the Druids. Po&s;terity will perhaps, in the &s;ame manner,
find fault with the Briti&s;h for not inve&s;tigating the learning and
religious opinions, which prevail in tho&s;e countries in A&s;ia, into which
either their commerce or their arms have penetrated. The Brahmins of the Ea&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in antient times, &s;ome reputation for knowledge, but we
have never had the curio&s;ity to examine whether there was any truth in the
reports of antiquity upon that head.</P>
<P>Excu&s;es, however, may be formed for our ignorance con|cerning
the learning, religion and philo&s;ophy of the Brahmins. Literary inquiries are
by no means a capital <PB N="xxii" REF="30"> object to many of our adventurers
in A&s;ia. The few who have a turn for re&s;earches of that kind, are
di&s;couraged by the very great difficulty in acquiring that language, in which
the learning of the Hindoos is contained; or by that impenetrable veil of
my&s;tery with which the Brahmins in|du&s;triou&s;ly cover their religious
tenets and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances combining together, have opened an ample
field for fiction. Modern travellers have accordingly indulged their talent for
fable, upon the my&s;terious re|ligion of Hindo&s;tan. Whether the ridiculous
tales they relate, proceed from that common partiality which Euro|peans, as
well as le&s;s enlightened nations, entertain for the religion and philo&s;ophy
of their own country, or from a judgment formed upon &s;ome external ceremonies
of the Hindoos, is very difficult to determine; but they have prejudiced Europe
again&s;t the Brahmins, and by a very un|fair account, have thrown di&s;grace
upon a &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion and philo&s;ophy, which they did by no means
inve&s;tigate.</P>
<P>The author of this di&s;&s;ertation mu&s;t own, that he for a long
time, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be carried down in this &s;tream of popular
prejudice. The pre&s;ent decline of literature in Hindo&s;tan, &s;erved to
confirm him in his belief of tho&s;e legends which he read in Europe,
concerning the Brah|mins. But conver&s;ing by accident, one day, with a noble
and learned Brahmin, he was not a little &s;urprized to find him perfectly
acquainted with tho&s;e opinions, which, both in ancient and modern Europe,
have employed the pens of the mo&s;t celebrated morali&s;ts. This
circum&s;tance did not fail to excite his curio&s;ity, and in the cour&s;e of
many &s;ub|&s;equent <PB N="xxiii" REF="31"> conver&s;ations, he found that
philo&s;ophy and the &s;ciences had, in former ages, made a very con&s;iderable
pro|gre&s;s in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Having then no intention to quit India for &s;ome time, he
re&s;olved to acquire &s;ome knowledge in the Shan&s;crita lan|guage; the grand
repo&s;itory of the religion, philo&s;ophy and hi&s;tory of the Hindoos. With
this view, he prevailed upon his noble friend the Brahmin, to procure for him a
Pundit, from the univer&s;ity of Benaris, well ver&s;ed in the Shan&s;crita,
and ma&s;ter of all the knowledge of that learned body. But before he had made
any con&s;iderable progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, an unexpected change of affairs
in Bengal, broke off all his literary &s;chemes. He found that the time he had
to remain in India would be too &s;hort to acquire the Shan&s;crita. He
determined therefore, through the medium of the Per&s;ian language, and through
the vulgar tongue of the Hindoos, to inform him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible,
concerning the my|thology and philo&s;ophy of the Brahmins. He, for this
pur|po&s;e, procured &s;ome of the principal SHASTERS, and his Pundit explained
to him, as many pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e curious books, as &s;erved to give him
a general idea of the doctrine which they contain.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to the Brahmins to confe&s;s that the author
of this di&s;&s;ertation is very &s;en&s;ible of his own inability to
illu&s;trate, with that fullne&s;s and per&s;picuity which it de|&s;erves, that
&s;ymbolical religion, which they are at &s;o much pains to conceal from
foreigners. He however can aver, that he has not mi&s;repre&s;ented one
&s;ingle circum&s;tance or tenet, though many may have e&s;caped his
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxiv" REF="32"> The books which contain the religion and
philo&s;ophy of the Hindoos, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Bedas. They
are four in number, and like the &s;acred writings of other nations, are &s;aid
to have been penned by the divinity. Beda in the Shan&s;crita, literally
&s;ignifies SCIENCE: for the&s;e books not only treat of religious and moral
duties, but of every branch of philo&s;ophical knowledge.</P>
<P>The Bedas are, by the Brahmins, held &s;o &s;acred, that they
per|mit no other &s;ect to read them; and &s;uch is the influence of
&s;uper&s;tition and prie&s;t-craft over the minds of the other CASTS in India,
that they would deem it an unpardonable &s;in to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity in
that re&s;pect, were it even within the compa&s;s of their power. The Brahmins
them|&s;elves are bound by &s;uch &s;trong ties of religion, to confine tho&s;e
writings to their own tribe, that were any of them known to read them to
others, he would be immediately excom|municated. This puni&s;hment is wor&s;e
than even death it|&s;elf among the Hindoos. The offender is not only thrown
down from the noble&s;t order to the mo&s;t polluted CAST, but his po&s;terity
are rendered for ever incapable of being re|ceived into his former dignity.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things con&s;idered, we are not to wonder that the
doctrine of the Bedas is &s;o little known in Europe. Even the literary part of
the Mahomedans of A&s;ia, reckon it an ab&s;tru&s;e and my&s;terious &s;ubject,
and candidly confe&s;s, that it is covered with a veil of darkne&s;s, which
they could never penetrate. Some have indeed &s;uppo&s;ed, that the learned
Feizi, brother to the celebrated Abul Fazil, chief &s;ecretary to the Emperor
Akbar, had read the Bedas, and di&s;covered the religious tenets contained in
them to that renowned Prince. <PB N="xxv" REF="33"> As the &s;tory of Feizi
made a good deal of noi&s;e in the ea&s;t, it may not be improper to give the
particulars of it in this place.</P>
<P>Mahummud Akbar being a prince of elevated and exten|&s;ive ideas,
was totally dive&s;ted of tho&s;e prejudices for his own religion, which men of
inferior parts not only imbibe with their mother's milk, but retain throughout
their lives. Though bred in all the &s;trictne&s;s of the Mahom|medan faith,
his great &s;oul in his riper years, broke tho&s;e chains of &s;uper&s;tition
and credulity, with which his tutors had, in his early youth, fettered his
mind. With a de&s;ign to chu&s;e his own religion, or rather from curio&s;ity,
he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire minutely into all the &s;y&s;|tems of
divinity, which prevailed among mankind. The &s;tory of his being in&s;tructed
in the chri&s;tian tenets, by a mi&s;&s;ionary from Portugal, is too well known
in Europe to require a place in this di&s;&s;ertation. As almo&s;t all
religions admit of pro&s;elytes, Akbar had good &s;ucce&s;s in his enquiries,
till he came to his own &s;ubjects the Hindoos. Contrary to the practice of all
other religious &s;ects, they admit of no converts; but they allow that every
one may go to heaven his own way, though they perhaps &s;uppo&s;e, that theirs
is the mo&s;t expeditious method to obtain that important end. They chu&s;e
rather to make a my&s;tery of their religion, than impo&s;e it upon the world,
like the Mahommedans, with the &s;word, or by means of the &s;take, after the
manner of &s;ome pious chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Not all the authority of Akbar could prevail with the Brahmins to
reveal the principles of their faith. He was therefore obliged to have
recour&s;e to artifice to obtain the information which he &s;o much de&s;ired.
The Emperor, for <PB N="xxvi" REF="34"> this purpo&s;e, concerted a plan with
his chief &s;ecretary, Abul Fazil, to impo&s;e Feizi, then a boy, upon the
Brahmins, in the character of a poor orphan of their tribe. Feizi being
in&s;tructed in his part, was privately &s;ent to Benaris, the prin|cipal
&s;eat of learning among the Hindoos. In that city the fraud was practi&s;ed on
a learned Brahmin, who received the boy into his hou&s;e, and educated him as
his own &s;on.</P>
<P>When Feizi, after ten years &s;tudy, had acquired the
Shan|&s;crita language, and all the knowledge of which the learned of Benaris
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, proper mea&s;ures were taken by the Emperor to &s;ecure
his &s;afe return. Feizi it &s;eems, during his re&s;idence with his patron the
Brahmin, was &s;mitten with the beauty of his only daughter; and indeed the
ladies of the Brahmin race are the hand&s;ome&s;t in Hindo&s;tan. The old
Brahmin &s;aw the mutual pa&s;&s;ion of the young pair with plea&s;ure, and as
he loved Feizi for his uncommon abilities, he offered him his daughter in
marriage. Feizi, perplexed between love and gratitude, at length di&s;covered
him&s;elf to the good old man, fell down at his feet, and gra&s;ping his knees,
&s;olicited with tears for forgivene&s;s, for the great crime he had committed
again&s;t his indulgent benefactor. The Brahmin, &s;truck dumb with
a&s;toni&s;hment, uttered not one word of reproach. He drew a dagger, which he
always carried on his girdle, and prepared to plunge it in his own brea&s;t.
Feizi &s;eized his hand, and conjured him, that if yet any atonement could be
made for the injury he had done him, he him&s;elf would &s;wear to deny him
nothing. The Brahmin, bur&s;ting into tears, told him, that if Feizi &s;hould
grant him two reque&s;ts, he would forgive him, and con&s;ent to live. Feizi,
without any he&s;itation, con&s;ented, and the <PB N="xxvii" REF="35">
Brahmin's reque&s;ts were, that he &s;hould never tran&s;late the Bedas, nor
repeat the creed of the Hindoos.</P>
<P>How far Feizi was bound by his oath not to reveal the doctrine of
the Bedas to Akbar is uncertain; but that neither he, nor any other per&s;on,
ever tran&s;lated tho&s;e books, is a truth beyond any di&s;pute. It is however
well known, that the Emperor afterwards greatly favoured the Hindoo faith, and
gave much offence to zealous Mahommedans, by prac|ti&s;ing &s;ome Indian
cu&s;toms which they thought &s;avoured of idolatry. But the
di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate part of mankind have always allowed, that Akbar was equally
dive&s;ted of all the follies of both the religious &s;uper&s;titions, which
prevailed among his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To return from this digre&s;&s;ion, the Brahmins maintain, that
the Bedas are the divine laws, which Brimha, at the creation of the world,
delivered for the in&s;truction of man|kind. But they affirm that their meaning
was perverted in the fir&s;t age, by the ignorance and wickedne&s;s of &s;ome
princes, whom they repre&s;ent as evil &s;pirits who then haunted the earth.
They call tho&s;e evil genii Dewtas, and tell many &s;trange allegorical
legends concerning them; &s;uch as, that the Bedas being lo&s;t, were
afterwards recovered by Bi&s;hen, in the form of a fi&s;h, who brought them up
from the bottom of the ocean, into which they were thrown by a Deo, or
Demon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t credible account we have of the Bedas, is, that about
the commencement of the Cal Jug, of which aera the pre|&s;ent year 1768, is the
4886th year, they were written, or rather collected by a great philo&s;opher,
and reputed prophet, called Be&auml;&s;s Muni, or Be&auml;&s;s the in&s;pired.
This learned man is <PB N="xxviii" REF="36"> otherwi&s;e called Kri&s;hen
Basdeo, and is &s;aid to have lived in the reign of Judi&s;hter, in the city of
Hi&s;tanapore, upon the river Jumna, near the pre&s;ent city of Delhi.</P>
<P>The Brahmins do not give to Be&auml;&s;s Muni the merit of being
the author of the Bedas. They however acknowledge, that he reduced them into
the pre&s;ent form, dividing them into four di&s;tinct books, after having
collected the detached pieces of which they are compo&s;ed, from every part of
India. It is, upon the whole, probable, that they are not the work of one man,
on account of their immen&s;e bulk.</P>
<P>The Mahomedans of A&s;ia, as well as &s;ome of the learn|ed of
Europe, have mi&s;taken Brimha, an allegorical per&s;on, for &s;ome
philo&s;opher of repute in India, whom they di&s;tin|gui&s;h by the disfigured
names of Bruma, Burma, and Bramha, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been the
writer of the religious books of the Hindoos. Feri&s;hta, in the hi&s;tory now
given to the public, affirms, that Brimha was of the race of Bang, and
flouri&s;hed in the reign of Kri&s;hen, fir&s;t monarch of Hindo&s;tan. But the
Brahmins deny, that any &s;uch per&s;on ever exi&s;ted, which we have rea&s;on
to believe is the truth; as Brimha in the Shan&s;crita language allegorically
&s;ignifies WISDOM, one of the principal attributes of the &s;upreme
divinity.</P>
<P>The four Bedas contain 100,000 a&s;hlogues or &s;tanzas in
ver&s;e, each of which con&s;i&s;ts of four lines. The fir&s;t Beda is called
RUG BEDA, which &s;ignifies the &s;cience of divination, concerning which it
principally treats. It al&s;o contains a&s;trology, a&s;tronomy, natural
philo&s;ophy, and a very parti|cular account of the creation of matter, and the
formation of the world.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxix" REF="37"> The &s;econd Beda is di&s;tingui&s;hed by
the name of SHEHAM. That word &s;ignifies piety or devotion, and this book
accord|ingly treats of all religious and moral duties. It al&s;o con|tains many
hymns in prai&s;e of the &s;upreme being, as well as ver&s;es in honour of
&s;ubaltern intelligences.</P>
<P>The third is the JUDGER BEDA, which, as the word implies,
comprehends the whole &s;cience of religious rites and cere|monies; &s;uch as
fa&s;ts, fe&s;tivals, purifications, penances, pilgrimages, &s;acrifices,
prayers, and offerings. They give the appellation of OBATAR BAH to the fourth
Beda. OBA|TAR &s;ignifies in the Shan&s;crita, the being, or the e&s;&s;ence,
and BAH good; &s;o that the Obatar Bah is literally the know|ledge of the good
being, and accordingly this book compre|hends the whole &s;cience of theology
and metaphy&s;ical philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The language of the Obatar Bah Beda is now become ob|&s;olete;
&s;o that very few Brahmins pretend to read it with propriety. Whether this
proceeds from its great antiquity, or from its being wrote in an uncommon
dialect of the Shan&s;crita, is hard to determine. We are inclined to be|lieve
that the fir&s;t is the truth; for we can by no means agree with a late
ingenious writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Holwell: The author of the
di&s;&s;ertation finds him&s;elf obliged to differ almo&s;t in every particular
concerning the religion of the Hindoos, from that gentleman.</NOTE>, who
affirms, that the Obatar Bah was written in a period po&s;terior to the re&s;t
of the Bedas.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that the Bedas are written in the
Shan&s;crita tongue. Whether the Shan&s;crita was, in any period of antiquity,
the vulgar language of Hindo&s;tan, <PB N="xxx" REF="38"> or was invented by
the Brahmins, to be a my&s;terious repo|&s;itory for their religion and
philo&s;ophy, is difficult to deter|mine. All other languages, it is true, were
ca&s;ually invent|ed by mankind, to expre&s;s their ideas and wants; but the
a&s;toni&s;hing formation of the Shan&s;crita &s;eems to be beyond the power of
chance. In regularity of etymology and gram|matical order, it far exceeds the
Arabic. It, in &s;hort, bears evident marks, that it has been fixed upon
rational prin|ciples, by a body of learned men, who &s;tudied regularity,
harmony, and a wonderful &s;implicity and energy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though the Shan&s;crita is amazingly copious, a very &s;mall
grammar and vocabulary &s;erve to illu&s;trate the principles of the whole. In
a treati&s;e of a few pages, the roots and pri|mitives are all comprehended,
and &s;o uniform is the rules for derivations and inflections, that the etymon
of every word is, with the greate&s;t facility, at once inve&s;tigated. The
pronunciation is the greate&s;t difficulty which attends the acquirement of the
language to perfection. This is &s;o quick and forcible, that a per&s;on, even
before the years of puber|ty, mu&s;t labour a long time before he can pronounce
it with propriety; but when once that is attained to perfection, it &s;trikes
the ear with amazing boldne&s;s and harmony. The alphabet of the Shan&s;crita
con&s;i&s;ts of fifty letters, but one half of the&s;e carry combined &s;ounds,
&s;o that its characters in fact, do not exceed ours in number. Some &s;mall
idea of the Shan&s;crita may be conveyed by the annexed plate, which contains
the alphabet, and the mea&s;ure of the four Bedas.</P>
<P>Before we &s;hall proceed to the religion and philo&s;ophy of the
Brahmins, it may not be improper to premi&s;e &s;omething <PB REF="39">

</TEXT> <PB N="xxxi" REF="40"> concerning the mo&s;t characteri&s;tical
manners and cu&s;toms of the Hindoos in general. The Hindoos are &s;o called
from Indoo or Hindoo, which, in the Shan&s;crita language, &s;igni|fies the
Moon; for from that luminary, and the &s;un, they deduce their fabulous origin.
The author of the di&s;&s;ertation has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a long li&s;t
of a dyna&s;ty of Kings, call|ed Hindoo-buns or Chunder-buns, both of which
words mean, the Children of the Moon. He al&s;o has a catalogue of the
Surage-buns, or the Children of the Sun, from whom many of the Rajas of
Hindo&s;tan pretend to derive their blood. Hindo&s;tan, the dome&s;tic
appellation of India, is a compo&s;ition of Hindoo, and Stan, a region; and the
great river Indus takes its name from the people, and not the people from the
river, as has been erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed in Europe.</P>
<P>The Hindoos have, from all antiquity, been divided into four great
tribes, each of which comprehend a variety of inferior ca&s;ts. The&s;e tribes
do not intermarry, eat, drink, or in any manner a&s;&s;ociate with one another,
except when they wor&s;hip at the temple of Jagga-nat<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jagga nat &s;ignifies Lord of the creation. This is one of the
names of Bi&s;hen and the Obatar, or Being, who is &s;aid to pre&s;ide over the
pre&s;ent period. He is repre&s;ented under the figure of a fat man, &s;itting
cro&s;s-legged, with his arms hanging down by his &s;ide as if they had no
&s;trength. This la&s;t circum&s;tance alludes to the imbecility of this age.
His temple is in the greate&s;t repute of any now in India.</NOTE> in
Ori&s;&s;a, where it is held a crime to make any di&s;tinction. The fir&s;t and
mo&s;t noble tribe are the Brahmins, who alone can officiate in the
prie&s;thood, like the Levites among the Jews. They are not however excluded
from government, trade, or agriculture, though they are &s;trictly prohibited
from all menial offices by their laws. They derive their name from Brimha, who
they allegorically &s;ay, produced the Brahmins from his head, when he created
the world.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxii" REF="41"> The &s;econd in order is the Sittri tribe, who
are &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Kittri or Koytri. They,
according to their original in&s;titution, ought to be all mili|tary men; but
they frequently follow other profe&s;&s;ions. Brimha is &s;aid to have produced
the Kittri from his heart, as an emblem of that courage which warriors &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The name of Bei&s;e or Bi&s;e is given to the third tribe. They are for
the mo&s;t part, merchants, bankers, and bunias or &s;hop-keepers. The&s;e are
figuratively &s;aid to have &s;prung from the belly of Brimha; the word Bei&s;h
&s;ignifying a provider or nouri&s;her. The fourth tribe is that of Sudder.
They ought to be menial &s;ervants, and they are incapable to rai&s;e
them&s;elves to any &s;uperior rank. They are &s;aid to have proceeded from the
feet of Brimha, in allu&s;ion to their low degree. But indeed it is contrary to
the inviolable laws of the Hindoos, that any per&s;on &s;hould ri&s;e from an
inferior ca&s;t into a higher tribe. If any therefore &s;hould be
excom|municated from any of the four tribes, he and his po&s;terity are forever
&s;hut out from &s;ociety of every body in the nation, excepting that of the
Harri ca&s;t, who are held in utter dete&s;|tation by all the other tribes, and
are employed only in the meane&s;t and vile&s;t offices. This circum&s;tance
renders excom|munication &s;o dreadful, that any Hindoo will &s;uffer the
tor|ture, and even death it&s;elf, rather than deviate from one article of his
faith. This &s;everity prevented all intermixture of blood between the tribes,
&s;o that, in their appearance, they &s;eem rather four different nations, than
members of the &s;ame community.</P>
<P>It is, as we have already ob&s;erved, a principle peculiar to the Hindoo
religion, not to admit of pro&s;elytes. In&s;tead of <PB N="xxxiii" REF="42">
being &s;olicitous about gaining converts, they always make a my&s;tery of
their faith. Heaven, &s;ay they, is like a palace with many doors, and every
one may enter in his own way. But this charitable di&s;po&s;ition never
encouraged other &s;ects to &s;ettle among them, as they mu&s;t have been
excluded en|tirely from all the benefits of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>When a child is born, &s;ome of the Brahmins are called. They pretend,
from the horo&s;cope of his nativity, to fore|tel his future fortune, by means
of &s;ome a&s;trological tables, of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When this
ceremony is over, they burn incen&s;e, and make an offering according to the
circum&s;tances of the parent; and without ever con&s;ulting them, tie the
zinar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;tring which all the Hindoos wear, by way of
charm or amulet.</NOTE> round the infant's neck, and impo&s;e a name upon him,
according to their own fancy.</P>
<P>Between the age of &s;even and ten, the children are, by their parents,
given away in marriage. The young pair are brought together, in order to
contract an intimacy with one another. But when they approach to the years of
pu|berty, they carefully &s;eparate them, till the female produces &s;igns of
womanhood. She then is taken from her parents to cohabit with her hu&s;band:
nor is &s;he ever after permitted to vi&s;it them. It is not lawful among the
Hindoos to marry nearer than the eighth degree of kindred. Polygamy is
per|mitted, but &s;eldom practi&s;ed; for they very rationally think, that one
wife is &s;ufficient for one man.</P>
<P>The extraordinary cu&s;tom of the women burning them|&s;elves with their
decea&s;ed hu&s;bands, has, for the mo&s;t part, fallen into de&s;uetude in
India; nor was it ever reckoned a <PB N="xxxiv" REF="43"> religious duty, as
has been very erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed in the We&s;t. This &s;pecies of
barbarity, like many others, ro&s;e originally from the fooli&s;h
enthu&s;ia&s;m of feeble minds. In a text in the Bedas, conjugal affection and
fidelity are thus figuratively inculcated: 
<Q REND="inline">"The woman, in &s;hort, who dies with her hu&s;band,
&s;hall enjoy life eternal with him in hea|ven."</Q> From this &s;ource the
Brahmins them&s;elves deduce this ridiculous cu&s;tom, which is a more rational
&s;olution of it, than the &s;tory which prevails in Europe; that it was a
poli|tical in&s;titution, made by one of the Emperors, to prevent wives from
poi&s;oning their hu&s;bands, a practice, in tho&s;e days, common in
Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>People of rank and tho&s;e of the higher ca&s;ts, burn their dead and
throw &s;ome incen&s;e into the pile. Some throw the bodies of their friends
into the Ganges, while others expo&s;e them on the high ways, as a prey to
vultures and wild bea&s;ts. There is one ca&s;t in the kingdom of Bengal, who
barbarou&s;ly expo&s;e their &s;ick by the river's &s;ide to die there. They
even &s;ometimes choak them with mud, when they think them pa&s;t hopes of
recovery. They defend this in|human cu&s;tom by &s;aying, that life is not an
adequate re|compence for the tortures of a lingering di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Hindoos have a code of laws in the NEA SHASTER. Trea&s;on, ince&s;t,
&s;acrilege, murder, adultery with the wife of a Brahmin, and theft, are
capital crimes. Though the Brahmins were the authors of tho&s;e laws, we do not
find that they have exempted them&s;elves from the puni&s;hment of death, when
guilty of tho&s;e crimes. This is one of tho&s;e numerous fables, which modern
travellers imported from the Ea&s;t. It is however certain, that the influence
of the <PB N="xxxv" REF="44"> Brahmins is &s;o great, and their characters as
prie&s;ts &s;o &s;acred, that they e&s;cape in ca&s;es where no mercy would be
&s;hewn to the other tribes.</P>
<P>Petty offences are puni&s;hed by temporary excommunica|tions,
pilgrimages, penances and fines, according to the degree of the crime, and the
wealth of the guilty per&s;on. But as the Hindoos are now, for the mo&s;t part,
&s;ubject to the Mahommedans, they are governed by the laws of the Koran, or by
the arbitrary will of the prince.</P>
<P>The Sena&s;&s;eys are a &s;ect of mendicant philo&s;ophers, com|monly
known by the name of Fakiers, which literally &s;ig|nifies poor people. The&s;e
idle and pretended devotees, a&s;&s;emble &s;ometimes in armies of ten or
twelve thou&s;and, and, under a pretext of making pilgrimages to certain
tem|ples, lay whole countries under contribution. The&s;e &s;aints wear no
clothes, are generally very robu&s;t, and convert the wives of the le&s;s holy
part of mankind to their own u&s;e, upon their religious progre&s;&s;es. They
admit any man of parts into their number, and they take great care to
in&s;truct their di&s;ciples in every branch of knowledge, to make the order
the more revered among the vulgar.</P>
<P>When this naked army of robu&s;t &s;aints direct their march to any
temple, the men of the provinces through which their road lies, very often fly
before them, notwith&s;tand|ing of the &s;anctified character of the Fakiers.
But the women are in general more re&s;olute, and not only remain in their
dwellings, but apply frequently for the prayers of tho&s;e holy per&s;ons,
which are found to be mo&s;t effectual in ca&s;es of &s;terility. When a Takier
is at prayers with the lady of <PB N="xxxvi" REF="45"> the hou&s;e, he leaves
either his &s;lipper or his &s;taff at the door, which if &s;een by the
hu&s;band, effectually prevents him from di&s;turbing their devotion. But
&s;hould he be &s;o un|fortunate as not to mind tho&s;e &s;ignals, a &s;ound
drubbing is the inevitable con&s;equence of his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though the Fakiers inforce with their arms, that reverence which the
people of Hindo&s;tan have naturally for their or|der, they inflict voluntary
penances of very extraordinary kinds upon them&s;elves, to gain more re&s;pect.
The&s;e fellows &s;ometimes hold up one arm in a fixed po&s;ition till it
becomes &s;tiff, and remains in that &s;ituation during the re&s;t of their
lives. Some clench their fi&s;ts very hard, and keep them &s;o till their nails
grow into their palms, and appear through the back of their hands. Others turn
their faces over one &s;houlder, and keep them in that &s;ituation, till they
fix for ever their heads looking backward. Many turn their eyes to the point of
their no&s;e, till they have lo&s;t the power of looking in any other
direction. The&s;e la&s;t, pretend &s;ome|times to &s;ee what they call the
&s;acred fire, which vi&s;ion, no doubt, proceeds from &s;ome di&s;order
ari&s;ing from the di&s;tor|tion of the optic nerves.</P>
<P>It often appears to Europeans in India, a matter of &s;ome ridicule to
conver&s;e with tho&s;e di&s;torted and naked philo&s;o|phers; though their
knowledge and external appearance, exhibit a very &s;triking contra&s;t. Some
are really what they &s;eem, enthu&s;ia&s;ts; but others put on the character
of &s;anc|tity, as a cloak for their plea&s;ures. But what actually makes them
a public nui&s;ance, and the aver&s;ion of poor hu&s;bands, is, that the women
think they derive &s;ome holine&s;s to them|&s;elves, from an intimacy with a
Fakier.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxvii" REF="46"> Many other fooli&s;h cu&s;toms, be&s;ides
tho&s;e we have mentioned, are peculiar to tho&s;e religious mendicants. But
enthu&s;ia&s;tic penances are not confined to them alone. Some of the vul|gar,
on the fa&s;t of Oppo&s;s, &s;u&s;pend them&s;elves on iron hooks, by the
fle&s;h of the &s;houlder-blade, to the end of a beam. This beam turns round
with great velocity, upon a pivot, on the head of a high pole. The
enthu&s;ia&s;t not only &s;eems in&s;en&s;ible of pain, but very often blows a
trumpet as he is whirled round above, and, at certain intervals, &s;ings a
&s;ong to the gaping multitude below; who very much admire his fortitude and
devotion. This ridiculous cu&s;tom is kept up to commemorate the &s;ufferings
of a martyr, who was in that manner, tortured for his faith.</P>
<P>To dwell longer upon the characteri&s;tical cu&s;toms and manners of the
Hindoos, would extend this di&s;&s;ertation too far. Some more particulars
concerning that nation, will naturally ari&s;e from an inve&s;tigation of their
religion and philo&s;ophy. This la&s;t was the capital de&s;ign of this
intro|ductory di&s;cour&s;e; and we hope to be able to throw a new, if not a
compleat light, on a &s;ubject hitherto little under&s;tood in the We&s;t. Some
writers have very lately given to the world, an unintelligible &s;y&s;tem of
the Brahmin religion; and they affirm, that they derived their information from
the Hindoos them&s;elves. This may be the ca&s;e, but they certainly
conver&s;ed upon that &s;ubject only with the inferior tribes, or with the
unlearned part of the Brahmins: and it would be as ridiculous to hope for a
true &s;tate of the reli|gion and philo&s;ophy of the Hindoos from tho&s;e
illiterate ca&s;ts, as it would be in a Mahommedan in London, to rely upon the
accounts of a pari&s;h beadle, concerning the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e points of the
Chri&s;tian faith; or, to form his opi|nion <PB N="xxxviii" REF="47"> of the
principles of the Newtonian philo&s;ophy, from a conver&s;ation with an
Engli&s;h carman.</P>
<P>The Hindoos are divided into two great religious &s;ects: the followers
of the doctrine of the BEDANG; and tho&s;e who adhere to the principles of the
NEADIRSIN. As the fir&s;t are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t orthodox, as well as the
mo&s;t ancient, we &s;hall begin to explain their opinions, by extracts
literally tran&s;lated from the original SHASTER<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sha&s;ter literally &s;ignifies Knowledge: but it is commonly
under&s;tood to mean a book which treats of divinity and the &s;ciences. There
are many Sha&s;ters among the Hindoos; &s;o that tho&s;e writers who affirmed,
that there was but one Sha&s;ter in India, which, like the Bible of the
Chri&s;tians, or Koran of the followers of Mahom|med, contained the fir&s;t
principles of the Brahmin &s;aith, have deceived them&s;elves and the
public.</NOTE>, which goes by the name of Bedang.</P>
<P>Bedang, the title of the Sha&s;ter, or commentary upon the Bedas,
concerning which we are about to treat, is a word compounded of Beda,
<HI>&s;cience,</HI> and Ang, <HI>body.</HI> The name of this Sha&s;ter
therefore, may be literally tran&s;lated, the Body of &s;cience. This book has,
in Europe, been errone|ou&s;ly called Vedam; and it is an expo&s;ition of the
doctrine of the Bedas, by that great philo&s;opher and prophet Be&acirc;&s;s
Muni, who, according to the Brahmins, flouri&s;hed about four thou&s;and years
ago. The Bedang is &s;aid to have been revi&s;ed &s;ome ages after
Be&acirc;&s;s Muni, by one Sirrider Swami, &s;ince which it has been reckoned
&s;acred, and not &s;ubject to any further alterations. Almo&s;t all the
Hindoos of the De|can, and tho&s;e of the Malabar and Coromandel coa&s;ts, are
of the &s;ect of the Bedang.</P>
<P> <PB N="xxxix" REF="48"> This commentary opens with a dialogue between
Brimha<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brimha is the genitive ca&s;e of BRIMH, which is
a primitive &s;ignifying GOD. He is called Brimha or WISDOM, the fir&s;t
attribute of the &s;upreme divinity. The divine wi&s;dom, under the name of
Brimha, is figuratively repre&s;ented with one head, having four faces, looking
to the four quarters, alluding to his &s;eeing all things. Upon the head of
this figure is a crown, an emblem of power and dominion. He has four hands,
implying, the omnipotence of divine wi&s;dom. In the fir&s;t hand he holds the
four Bedas, as a &s;ymbol of knowledge; in the &s;econd a &s;cepter, as a token
of authority; and in the third a ring, or compleat circle, as an emblem of
eternity. Brimha holds nothing in the fourth hand, which implies, that THE
WISDOM OF GOD is always ready to lend his aid to his creatures. He is
repre&s;ented riding upon a goo&s;e, the em|blem of &s;implicity among the
Hindoos. The latter circum&s;tance is intended to imply the &s;implicity of the
operations of nature, which is but another name for the wi&s;dom of the
divinity. The&s;e explications of the in&s;ignia of Brimha, were given by the
Brah|min, and are, by no means, conjectures of the author of this
di&s;&s;ertation.</NOTE>, the Wi&s;dom of the Divinity; and Narud<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Narud literally &s;ignifies REASON, emphatically called the &s;on

Narud de|&s;ires to be in&s;tructed by his father, and for that purpo&s;e, puts
the following que&s;tions to him.</P>

<P>O father! thou fir&s;t of God<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brimh.</NOTE>,
thou art &s;aid to have created the world, and thy &s;on Narud, a&s;toni&s;hed

were made.</P>

This is one of the thou&s;and names of GOD, which have &s;o much perplexed the
writers of Europe. In the an&s;wer of Brimha, mention is made of the fir&s;t
three great deities of the Hindoos; which three, however, they by no means
wor&s;hip as di&s;tinct beings from God, but only as his principal
attributes.</NOTE>, and a part of his being, whom he called forth to execute
his eternal de&s;igns.</P>

text. Whether we, who profe&s;s chri&s;tianity, and call the Hin|doos by the

the fir&s;t man and woman, according to the &s;y&s;tem of the Hindoos; whereas

that it was impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand it, without a compleat knowledge of
the Shan&s;crita. The author of the Bedang, thinking perhaps, that the
philo&s;ophical catechi&s;m which we have tran&s;lated above, was too pure for
narrow and &s;u|per&s;titious minds, has in&s;erted into his work, a &s;trange
alle|gorical account of the creation, for the purpo&s;es of vulgar theology. In
this tale, the attributes of God, the human pa&s;&s;ions and faculties of the
mind are per&s;onified, and intro|duced upon the &s;tage. As this allegory may
afford matter of &s;ome curio&s;ity to the public, we &s;hall here tran&s;late
it.</P>
<Q> 
<P>BRIMH exi&s;ted from all eternity, in a form of infinite di|men&s;ions.
When it plea&s;ed him to create the world, he &s;aid, <HI>Ri&s;e up, O
Brimha</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The wi&s;dom of God.</NOTE>. Immediately a
&s;pirit of the colour of flame i&s;&s;ued from his navel, having four heads
and four hands, Brimha gazing round, and &s;eeing nothing but the immen&s;e
image, out of which he had proceeded, he tra|velled a thou&s;and years, to
endeavour to comprehend its dimen&s;ions. But after all his toil, he found
him&s;elf as much at a lo&s;s as before.</P> 
<P>Lo&s;t in amazement, Brimha gave over his journey. He fell pro&s;trate
and prai&s;ed what he &s;aw, with his four mouths. The almighty, then, with a
voice like ten thou&s;and thun|ders, was plea&s;ed to &s;ay: Thou ha&s;t done
well, O Brimha, for thou can&s;t not comprehend me!&mdash;Go and create the
world!&mdash;How can I create it?&mdash;A&s;k of me, and power &s;hall be given
unto thee.&mdash;O God, &s;aid Brimha, thou art almighty in power!&mdash;</P> 
<P> <PB N="xlvii" REF="56"> Brimha forthwith perceived the idea of things,
as if floating before his eyes. He &s;aid, LET THEM BE, and all that he &s;aw
became real before him. Then fear &s;truck the frame of Brimha, le&s;t tho&s;e
things &s;hould be annihilated. O immortal Brimh! he cried, who &s;hall
pre&s;erve tho&s;e things which I behold. In the in&s;tant a &s;pirit of a blue
colour i&s;&s;ued from Brimha's mouth, and &s;aid aloud, I WILL. Then &s;hall
thy name be Bi&s;hen<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The providence of God.</NOTE>,
becau&s;e thou ha&s;t undertaken to pre&s;erve all things.</P> 
<P>Brimha then commanded Bi&s;hen to go and create all ani|mals, with
vegetables for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, to po&s;&s;e&s;s that earth which he
him&s;elf had made. Bi&s;hen forthwith created all manner of bea&s;ts, fi&s;h,
foul, in&s;ects and reptiles. Trees and gra&s;s ro&s;e al&s;o beneath his
hands, for Brimha had inve&s;ted him with power. But man was &s;till wanting to
rule the whole: and Brimha commanded Bi&s;hen to form him. Bi&s;hen began the
work, but the men he made were idiots with great bellies, for he could not
in&s;pire them with knowledge; &s;o that in every thing but in &s;hape, they
re|&s;embled the bea&s;ts of the field. They had no pa&s;&s;ion but to
&s;atisfy their carnal appetites.</P> 
<P>Brimha, offended at the men, de&s;troyed them, and pro|duced four
per&s;ons from his own breath, whom he called by four different names. The name
of the fir&s;t was Sin|noc<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Body.</NOTE>, of the
&s;econd, Sinnunda<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Life.</NOTE>, of the third,
Sonnatin<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Permanency.</NOTE>, and of the fourth,
Sonninkunar<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Intellectual exi&s;tence.</NOTE>. The&s;e
four per&s;ons were ordered by Brimha, to rule over the creatures, and to
po&s;&s;e&s;s <PB N="xlviii" REF="57"> for ever the world. But they refu&s;ed
to do any thing but to prai&s;e God, having nothing of the de&s;tructive
quality<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Timmu-goon.</NOTE> in their compo&s;ition.</P> 
<P>Brimha, for this contempt of his orders, became angry, and lo! a brown
&s;pirit &s;tarted from between his eyes. He &s;at down before Brimha, and
began to weep: then lifting up his eyes, he a&s;ked him, 
<Q REND="inline">"Who am I, and where &s;hall be the place of my
abode."</Q> Thy name &s;hall be Rudder<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The weeper;
becau&s;e he was produced in tears. One of the names of Shibah, the
de&s;tructive attribute of the Divinity.</NOTE>, &s;aid Brimha, and all nature
&s;hall be the place of thine abode. But ri&s;e up, O Rudder! and form man to
govern the world.</P> 
<P>Rudder immediately obeyed the orders of Brimha. He be|gan the work, but
the men he made were fiercer than tigers, having nothing but the de&s;tructive
quality in their compo&s;itions. They, however, &s;oon de&s;troyed one another,
for anger was their only pa&s;&s;ion. Brimha, Bi&s;hen, and Rudder then joined
their different powers. They created ten men, who&s;e names were, Narud, Dico,
Ba&s;hi&s;ta, Birga, Kirku, Pulla, Puli&s;ta, Ongira, Otteri and Murichi<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The &s;ignifications of the&s;e ten names are in order, the&s;e.
Rea&s;on, Ingenuity, Emulation, Humility, Piety, Pride, Patience, Charity,
Deceit, Mortality.</NOTE>: The general appellation of the whole, was the
Munies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The In&s;pired.</NOTE>. Brimha then produced
Dirmo<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fortune.</NOTE> from his brea&s;t, Adirmo<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Misfortune.</NOTE> from his back, Loab<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Appetite.</NOTE> from his lip, and K&acirc;m<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> from his heart. This la&s;t being a beautiful female,
Brimha looked upon her with amorous eyes. But the Munies told him, that &s;he
was his own daughter; upon which he &s;hrunk back, and produced a blu&s;hing
virgin called Ludja<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Shame.</NOTE>. Brimha thinking his
body defiled by throwing his <PB N="xlix" REF="58"> eyes upon K&acirc;m,
changed it, and produced ten women, one of which was given to each of the
Munies.</P> </Q>
<P>In this divi&s;ion of the Bedang Sha&s;ter, there is a long li&s;t of
the Surage Buns, or children of the &s;un, who, it is &s;aid, ruled the world
in the fir&s;t periods. But as the whole is a mere dream of imagination, and
&s;carcely the belief of the Hindoo children and women, we &s;hall not
tre&s;pa&s;s further on the patience of the public with the&s;e allegories. The
Brahmins of former ages wrote many volumes of romances upon the lives and
actions of tho&s;e pretended Kings, incul|cating, after their manner, morality
by fable. This was the grand fountain from which the religion of the vulgar in
India was corrupted; if the vulgar of any country re|quire any adventitious aid
to corrupt their ideas, upon &s;o my&s;terious a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the opinions of the author of the Be|dang, upon the
&s;ubject of religion, are not unphilo&s;ophical. He maintains that the world
was created out of nothing by God, and that it will be again annihilated. The
unity, infi|nity and omnipotence of the &s;upreme divinity are inculcated by
him: for though he pre&s;ents us with a long li&s;t of infe|rior beings, it is
plain that they are merely allegorical; and neither he nor the &s;en&s;ible
part of his followers believe their actual exi&s;tence. The more ignorant
Hindoos, it cannot be denied, think that the&s;e &s;ubaltern divinities do
exi&s;t, in the &s;ame manner, that Chri&s;tians believe in Angels: but the
unity of God was always a fundamental tenet of the uncorrupted faith of the
more learned Brahmins.</P>
<P> <PB N="l" REF="59"> The opinion of this philo&s;opher, that the &s;oul,
after death, a&s;&s;umes a body of the purer elements, is not pecu|liar to the
Brahmins. It de&s;cended from the Druids of Eu|rope, to the Greeks, and was the
&s;ame with the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Homer. His
idea of the manner of the tran&s;migration of the human &s;oul into various
bodies, is peculiar to him&s;elf. As he holds it as a maxim that a portion of
the GREAT SOUL or God, animates every living thing; he thinks it no ways
incon&s;i&s;tent, that the &s;ame portion that gave life to man, &s;hould
afterwards pa&s;s into the body of any other animal. This tran&s;migration does
not, in his opinion, deba&s;e the quality of the &s;oul: for when it extricates
it&s;elf from the fetters of the fle&s;h, it rea&s;&s;umes its original
nature.</P>
<P>The followers of the BEDANG SHASTER do not allow that any phy&s;ical
evil exi&s;ts. They maintain that God created all things perfectly good, but
that man, being a free agent, may be guilty of moral evil: which, however, only
re&s;pects him&s;elf and &s;ociety, but is of no detriment to the general
&s;y&s;tem of nature. God, &s;ay they, has no pa&s;&s;ion but bene|volence: and
being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no wrath, he never puni&s;hes the wicked, but by the
pain and affliction which are the natural con&s;equences of evil actions. The
more learned Brahmins therefore affirm, that the hell which is men|tioned in
the Bedang, was only intended as a mere bug|bear to the vulgar, to inforce upon
their minds, the duties of morality: for that hell is no other than a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil, and tho&s;e bad con&s;equences which invariably
fol|low wicked deeds.</P>
<P>Before we &s;hall proceed to the doctrine of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, it
may not be improper to give a tran&s;lation of the <PB N="li" REF="60"> fir&s;t
chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, which throws a clear light upon the religious

<P>Without making any reflections upon this chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, it
appears evident, that the religion of the Hindoos has hitherto been very much
mi&s;repre&s;ented in Europe. The followers of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, differ
greatly in their philo&s;ophy, from the &s;ect of the BEDANG, though both agree
about the unity of the &s;upreme being. To give &s;ome idea of the Neadir&s;en
philo&s;ophy, we &s;hall, in this place, give &s;ome extracts from that
Sha&s;ter.</P>
<P>NEADIRSEN is a compound from NEA, &s;ignifying right, and DIRSEN, to
teach or explain; &s;o that the word may be <PB N="lvi" REF="65"> tran&s;lated
an <HI>exhibition of truth.</HI> Though it is not reckoned &s;o antient as the
Bedang, yet it is &s;aid to have been written by a philo&s;opher called Goutam,
near four thou&s;and years ago. The philo&s;ophy contained in this Sha&s;ter,
is very ab|&s;tru&s;e and metaphy&s;ical; and therefore it is but ju&s;tice to
Goutam to confe&s;s, that the author of the di&s;&s;ertation,
not|with&s;tanding the great pains he took to have proper defini|tions of the
terms, is by no means certain, whether he has fully attained his end. In this
&s;tate of uncertainty he cho&s;e to adhere to the literal meaning of words,
rather than by a free tran&s;lation, to deviate perhaps from the &s;en&s;e of
his author.</P>
<P>The generality of the Hindoos of Bengal, and all the northern provinces
of Hindo&s;tan, e&s;teem the NEADIRSEN a &s;a|cred Sha&s;ter; but tho&s;e of
the Decan, Coromandel, and Ma|labar, totally reject it. It con&s;i&s;ts of
&s;even volumes. The fir&s;t only came to the hands of the author of the
di&s;&s;ertation, and he has, &s;ince his arrival in England, depo&s;ited it in
the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. He can &s;ay nothing for certain, concern|ing the
contents of the &s;ub&s;equent volumes; only that they contain a compleat
&s;y&s;tem of the theology and philo&s;ophy of the Brahmins of the Neadir&s;en
&s;ect.</P>
<P>Goutam does not begin to rea&s;on, <HI>a priori,</HI> like the writer of
the Bedang. He con&s;iders the pre&s;ent &s;tate of nature, and the
intellectual faculties, as far as they can be inve&s;ti|gated by human
rea&s;on; and from thence he draws all his conclu&s;ions. He reduces all things
under &s;ix principal heads; &s;ub&s;tance, quality, motion, &s;pecies,
a&s;&s;imulation, and con&s;truction<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are in the
original Shan&s;crita, Dirba, Goon, Kirmo, Summania, Bi&s;he&s;h,
Sammabac.</NOTE>. In &s;ub&s;tance, be&s;ides time, &s;pace, life, 
<PB N="lvii" REF="66"> and &s;pirit, he comprehends earth, water, fire, air,
and aka&s;h. The four gro&s;&s;er elements, he &s;ays, come under the immediate
comprehen&s;ion of our bodily &s;en&s;es; and aka&s;h, time, &s;pace, &s;oul
and &s;pirit, come under mental perception.</P>
<P>He maintains, that all objects of perception are equally real, as we
cannot comprehend the nature of a &s;olid cubit, any more than the &s;ame
extent of &s;pace. He affirms, that di&s;tance in point of time and &s;pace,
are equally incompre|hen&s;ible; &s;o that if we &s;hall admit, that &s;pace is
a real ex|i&s;tence, time mu&s;t be &s;o too. That the &s;oul, or vital
prin|ciple, is a &s;ubtile element, which pervades all things; for that
intellect, which, according to experience in animals, cannot proceed from
organization and vital motion only, mu&s;t be a principle totally di&s;tinct
from them.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The author of the Bedant<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">A

<P>He then proceeds to explain what he means by his &s;econd principle, or

Kirmo or motion is, according to him, of two kinds, direct and crooked.
Sammania, or &s;pecies, which is his third principle, includes all animals and
natural productions. Bi|&s;he&s;h he defines to be a tendency in matter towards
produc|tions; and Sammabae, or the la&s;t principle, is the artificial
con&s;truction or formation of things, as a &s;tatue from a block of marble, a
hou&s;e from &s;tones, or cloth from cotton.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e &s;ix heads, as we have already ob&s;erved, Gou|tam
comprehends all things which fall under our compre|hen&s;ion; and after having
rea&s;oned about their nature and origin, in a very philo&s;ophical manner, he
concludes with a&s;&s;erting, that five things mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be
eternal. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is Pirrum Attima, or the GREAT SOUL, who,
&s;ays he, is immaterial, one, invi&s;ible, eternal, and indivi&s;ible,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing omni&s;cience, re&s;t, will, and power<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The&s;e properties of the divinity, are the following in order;
Nidakaar, Akitta, Oderi&s;a, Nitte, Apparticta, Bud&s;irba, Suck, Itcha,
Jotna.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;econd eternal principle is the Jive Attima, or the vi|tal &s;oul,
which he &s;uppo&s;es is material, by giving it the fol|lowing properties;
number, quantity, motion, contraction, exten&s;ion, divi&s;ibility, perception,
plea&s;ure, pain, de&s;ire, aver|&s;ion, accident, and power. His rea&s;ons for
maintaining, that the <HI>vital &s;oul</HI> is different from the <HI>great
&s;oul,</HI> are very nu|merous, and it is upon this head that the followers of
the Bedang and Neadir&s;en are principally divided. The fir&s;t affirm that
there is no &s;oul in the univer&s;e but God, and the &s;econd &s;trenuou&s;ly
hold that there is, as they cannot con|ceive, that God can be &s;ubject to
&s;uch affections and pa&s;&s;ions as they feel in their own minds; or that he
can po&s;&s;ibly have a propen&s;ity to evil. Evil, according to the author of
the <PB N="lix" REF="68"> Neadir&s;en Sha&s;ter, proceeds entirely from Jive
Attima, or the vital &s;oul. It is a &s;elfi&s;h craving principle, never to be
&s;atisfied; whereas GOD remains in eternal re&s;t, without any de&s;ire but
benevolence.</P>
<P>Goutam's third eternal principle is time or duration, which, &s;ays he,
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have exi&s;ted, while any thing did exi&s;t; and is
therefore infinite. The fourth prin|ciple is &s;pace or exten&s;ion, without
which nothing could have been; and as it comprehends all quantity, or rather is
infinite, he maintains, that it is indivi&s;ible and eternal. The fifth eternal
principle is Aka&s;h, a &s;ubtile and pure element, which fills up the vacuum
of &s;pace, and is compounded of purmans or quantities, infinitely &s;mall,
indivi&s;ible and per|petual. 
<Q REND="inline">"God," &s;ays he, "can neither make nor annihi|late
the&s;e atoms, on account of the love which he bears to them, and the
nece&s;&s;ity of their exi&s;tence; but they are, in other re&s;pects, totally
&s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"God," &s;ays Goutam, "at a certain &s;ea&s;on, endued
the&s;e atoms, as we may call them, with Bi&s;he&s;h or pla&s;ticity, by virtue
of which they arranged them&s;elves into four gro&s;s elements, fire, air,
water, and earth. The&s;e atoms being, from the beginning, formed by God into
the <HI>&s;eeds</HI> of all pro|ductions, Jive Attima, or the vital &s;oul,
a&s;&s;ociated with them, &s;o that animals, and plants of various kinds, were
produced upon the face of the earth."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;ame vital &s;oul," continues Goutam, "which
be|fore a&s;&s;ociated with the Purman of an animal, may after|wards
a&s;&s;ociate with the Purman of a man."</Q> This tran&s;mi|gration 
<PB N="lx" REF="69"> is di&s;tingui&s;hed by three names, Mirt, Mirren, and
Pirra-purra-purve&s;h, which la&s;t literally &s;ignifies <HI>the change of
abode.</HI> The &s;uperiority of man, according to the philo&s;ophy of the
Neadir&s;en, con&s;i&s;ts only in the finer organization of his parts, from
which proceed rea&s;on, reflexion, and me|mory, which the brutes only
po&s;&s;e&s;s in an inferior degree, on account of their le&s;s refined
organs.</P>
<P>Goutam &s;uppo&s;es, with the author of the Bedang, that the &s;oul
after death, a&s;&s;umes a body of fire, air, and aka&s;h, un|le&s;s in the
carnal body, it has been &s;o purified by piety and virtue, that it retains no
&s;elfi&s;h inclinations. In that ca&s;e it is ab&s;orbed into the GREAT SOUL
OF NATURE, never more to reanimate fle&s;h. Such, &s;ays the philo&s;opher,
&s;hall be the reward of all tho&s;e who wor&s;hip God from pure love and
admiration, without any &s;elfi&s;h views. Tho&s;e that &s;hall wor|&s;hip God
from motives of future happine&s;s, &s;hall be indul|ged with their de&s;ires
in heaven, for a certain time. But they mu&s;t al&s;o expiate their crimes, by
&s;uffering adequate puni&s;hments; and afterwards their &s;ouls will return to
the earth, and wander about for new habitations. Upon their return to the
earth, they &s;hall ca&s;ually a&s;&s;ociate with the fir&s;t organized Purman
they &s;hall meet. They &s;hall not retain any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their
former &s;tate, unle&s;s it is revealed to them by God. But tho&s;e favoured
per&s;ons are very few, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Jates
Summon<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The acquainted with their former
&s;tate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The author of the Neadir&s;en teaches, for the purpo&s;es of morality,
that the &s;ins of the parents will de&s;cend to their po&s;terity; and that,
on the other hand, the virtues of the children will mitigate the puni&s;hments
of the parents in <PB N="lxi" REF="70"> Nirick, and ha&s;ten their return to
the earth. Of all &s;ins he holds ingratitude<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mitterdro.</NOTE> to be the greate&s;t. Souls guilty of that black
crime, &s;ays he, will remain in hell, while the &s;un remains in heaven, or to
the general di&s;&s;olution of all things.</P>
<P>Intellect, &s;ays Goutam, is formed by the combined action of the
&s;en&s;es. He reckons &s;ix &s;en&s;es: five external<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Onnuman, rea&s;on. Upimen, perception.</NOTE>, and one internal.
The la&s;t he calls Manus, by which he &s;eems to mean con&s;cience. In the
latter he comprehends rea&s;on, perception<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chakous,
Shraban, Ra&s;an, Granap, Tawa&s;s.</NOTE> and memory: and he concludes, that
by their means only, mankind may po&s;&s;ibly acquire knowledge. He then
proceeds to explain the manner by which the&s;e &s;en&s;es act.</P>
<P>Sight, &s;ays he, ari&s;es from the Shan&s;kar or repul&s;ive qua|lities
of bodies, by which the particles of light which fall upon them, are reflected
back upon the eyes from all parts of their &s;urfaces. Thus the object is
painted in a perfect manner upon the organ of &s;eeing, whither the &s;oul
repairs to receive the image. He affirms, that, unle&s;s the &s;oul fixes its
attention upon the figure in the eye, nothing can be per|ceived by the mind;
for a man in a profound reverie, though his eyes are open to the light,
perceives nothing. Colours, &s;ays Coutam, are particular feelings in the eye,
which are proportioned to the quantity of light reflected from any &s;olid
body.</P>
<P>Goutam de&s;ines hearing in the &s;ame manner with the European
philo&s;ophers, with this difference only, that he <PB N="lxii" REF="71">
&s;uppo&s;es, that the &s;ound which affects the ear, is conveyed through the
purer element of aka&s;h, and not by the air; an error which is not very
&s;urprizing, in a &s;peculative philo|&s;opher. Ta&s;te, he defines to be a
&s;en&s;ation of the tongue and palate, occa&s;ioned by the particular form of
tho&s;e particles which compo&s;e food. Smell, &s;ays he, proceeds from the
effluvia which ari&s;e from bodies to the no&s;trils. The feel|ing, which
ari&s;es from touching, is occa&s;ioned by the con|tact of den&s;e bodies with
the &s;kin, which, as well as the whole body, excepting the bones, the hair and
the nails, is the organ of that &s;en&s;e. There runs, &s;ays he, from all
parts of the &s;kin, very &s;mall nerves to a great nerve, which he
di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of Medda. This nerve is com|po&s;ed of two
different coats, the one &s;en&s;itive, and the other in&s;en&s;itive. It
extends from the crown of the head, down the right &s;ide of the vertebrae to
the right foot<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To &s;ave the credit of Goutam, in this
place, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that anatomy is not at all known among
the Hindoos, being &s;trictly prohibited from touch|ing a dead body, by the
&s;evere&s;t ties of religion.</NOTE>. When the body becomes languid, the
&s;oul, fatigued with action, re|tires within the in&s;en&s;ible coat, which
checks the operation of the &s;en&s;es, and occa&s;ions &s;ound &s;leep. But
&s;hould there remain in the &s;oul, a &s;mall inclination to action, it
&s;tarts into the &s;en&s;itive part of the nerve, and dreams immediately
ari&s;e before it. The&s;e dreams, &s;ays he, invariably relate to &s;omething
perceived before by the &s;en&s;es, though the mind may combine the ideas
together at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Manus, or con&s;cience, is the internal feeling of the mind, when it is
no way affected by external objects. Onnuman, or rea&s;on, &s;ays Goutam, is
that faculty of the &s;oul which enables us to conclude that things and
circum&s;tances exi&s;t, <PB N="lxiii" REF="72"> from an analogy to things,
which had before fallen under the conception of our bodily &s;en&s;es: For
in&s;tance, when we &s;ee &s;moak, we conclude that it proceeds from a fire;
when we &s;ee one end of a rope, we are per&s;uaded that it mu&s;t have
another.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on, continues Goutam, men perceive the exi&s;tence of God;
which the Boad or Athei&s;ts deny, becau&s;e his ex|i&s;tence does not come
within the comprehen&s;ion of the &s;en&s;es. The&s;e athei&s;ts, &s;ays he,
maintain, that there is no God but the univer&s;e; that there is neither good
nor evil in the world; that there is no &s;uch thing as a &s;oul; that all
animals exi&s;t, by a mere mechani&s;m of the organs, or by a fermentation of
the elements; and that all natural produc|tions are but the fortuitous
concour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>The philo&s;opher refutes the&s;e athei&s;tical opinions, by a long
train of arguments, &s;uch as have been often urged by European divines. Though
&s;uper&s;tition and cu&s;tom may bia&s;s rea&s;on to different ends, in
various countries, we find a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;imilarity in the arguments
u&s;ed by all nations, again&s;t the BOAD, tho&s;e common enemies of every
&s;y&s;tem of religion.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Another &s;ect of the BOAD, &s;ays Goutam, are of
opinion that all things were produced by chance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Addari&s;to.</NOTE>."</Q> This doctrine he thus refutes. Chance is
&s;o far from being the origin of all things, that it has but a momentary
exi&s;tence of its own; being alternately created and annihilated, at periods
infi|nitely &s;mall, as it depends entirely on the action of real 
<PB N="lxiv" REF="73"> e&s;&s;ences. This action is not accidental, for it
mu&s;t inevi|tably proceed from &s;ome natural cau&s;e. Let the dice be rattled
eternally in the box, they are determined in their motion, by certain
invariable laws. What therefore we call chance, is but an effect proceeding
from cau&s;es which we do not perceive.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Perception," continues Goutam, "is that faculty by
which we in&s;tantaneou&s;ly know things without the help of rea&s;on. This is
perceived by means of relation, or &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing property in
things, &s;uch as high and low, long and &s;hort, great and &s;mall, hard and
&s;oft, cold and hot, black and white."</Q></P>
<P>Memory, according to Goutam, is the ela&s;ticity of the mind, and is
employed in three different ways; on things pre&s;ent as to time, but ab&s;ent
as to place; on things pa&s;t, and on things to come. It would appear from the
latter part of the di&s;tinction, that the philo&s;opher comprehends
imagination in memory. He then proceeds to define all the original properties
of matter, and all the pa&s;&s;ions and faculties of the mind. He then
de&s;cants on the nature of generation.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Generation, &s;ays he, may be divided into two kinds;
Jonidge, or generation by copulation; and adjonidge, gene|ration without
copulation. All animals are produced by the fir&s;t, and all plants by the
latter. The purman or &s;eed of things, was formed from the beginning, with all
its parts. When it happens to be depo&s;ited in a matrix &s;uitable to its
nature, a &s;oul a&s;&s;ociates with it; and, by a&s;&s;imulating 
<PB N="lxv" REF="74"> more matter, it gradually becomes a creature or plant;
for plants, as well as animals, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a portion of the
<HI>vital &s;oul</HI> of the world."</Q></P>
<P>Goutam, in another place, treats diffu&s;ely of providence and free
will. He divides the action of man under three heads: The will of God, the
power of man, and ca&s;ual or accidental events. In explaining the fir&s;t, he
maintains a particular providence; in the &s;econd, the freedom of will in man;
and in the third, the common cour&s;e of things, according to the general laws
of nature. With re&s;pect to providence, though he cannot deny the
po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence, without dive&s;ting God of his omnipotence,
he &s;uppo&s;es that the deity never exerts that power, but that he remains in
eternal re&s;t, taking no concern, neither in hu|man affairs, nor in the
cour&s;e of the operations of nature.</P>
<P>The author of the Neadir&s;en maintains, that the world is &s;ubject to
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;&s;olutions and renovations at certain &s;tated periods.
He divides the&s;e di&s;&s;olutions into the le&s;&s;er and the greater. The
le&s;&s;er di&s;&s;olution will happen at the end of a revolution of the Jugs.
The world will be then con&s;umed by fire, and the elements &s;hall be jumbled
together, and after a certain &s;pace of time, they will again re&s;ume their
former order. When a thou&s;and of tho&s;e &s;maller di&s;&s;olutions &s;hall
have happened, a MAHPER|LEY or great di&s;&s;olution will take place. All the
elements will then be reduced to their original Purmans or atoms, in which
&s;tate they &s;hall long remain. God will then, from his mere goodne&s;s and
plea&s;ure, re&s;tore Bi&s;heth or pla&s;ti|city. A new creation will ari&s;e;
and thus things have <PB N="lxvi" REF="75"> revolved in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from
the beginning, and will con|tinue to do &s;o to eternity.</P>
<P>The&s;e repeated di&s;&s;olutions and renovations have fur|ni&s;hed an
ample field for the inventions of the Brahmins. Many allegorical &s;y&s;tems of
creation are upon that account contained in the Sha&s;ters. It was for this
rea&s;on, that &s;o many different accounts of the co&s;mogony of the Hindoos
have been promulgated in Europe; &s;ome travellers adopting one &s;y&s;tem, and
&s;ome another. Without deviating from the good manners due to tho&s;e writers,
we may venture to affirm, that their tales, upon this &s;ubject, are extreamly
puerile, if not ab&s;urd. They took their accounts from any common Brahmin,
with whom they chanced to meet, and never had the curio&s;ity or indu&s;try to
go to the fountain head.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the renovations of the world, Brimha, or the wi&s;dom of
God, is repre&s;ented in the form of an infant with his toe in his mouth,
floating on a comala or water flower, or &s;ometimes upon a leaf of that plant,
upon the watery aby&s;s. The Brahmins mean no more by this allegory, than that
at that time, the wi&s;dom and de&s;igns of God will ap|pear, as in their
infant &s;tate. Brimha floating upon a leaf, &s;hews the in&s;tability of
things at that period. The toe which he &s;ucks in his mouth, implies that
infinite wi&s;dom &s;ub&s;i&s;ts of it&s;elf; and the po&s;ition of Brimha's
body, is an emblem of the endle&s;s circle of eternity.</P>
<P>We &s;ee Brimha &s;ometimes creeping forth from a winding &s;hell. This
is an emblem of the untraceable way by which divine wi&s;dom i&s;&s;ues &s;orth
from the <HI>infinite ocean of</HI> <PB N="lxvii" REF="76"> <HI>God.</HI> He,
at other times, blows up the world with a pipe, which implies, that the earth
is but a bubble of vanity, which the breath of his mouth can de&s;troy. Brimha,
in one of the renovations, is repre&s;ented in the form of a &s;nake, one end
of which, is upon a tortoi&s;e which floats upon the va&s;t aby&s;s, and upon
the other, he &s;upports the world. The &s;nake is the emblem of wi&s;dom, the
tortoi&s;e is a &s;ymbol of &s;ecurity, which figuratively &s;ignifies
providence, and the va&s;t aby&s;s is the eternity and infinitude of God.</P>
<P>What has been already &s;aid has, it is hoped, thrown a new light on the
opinions of the Hindoos, upon the &s;ubject of religion and philo&s;ophical
inquiry. We find that the Brahmins, contrary to the ideas formed of them in the
we&s;t, invariably believe in the unity, eternity, omni&s;cience and
omnipotence of God: that the polythei&s;m of which they have been accu&s;ed, is
no more than a &s;ymbolical wor&s;hip of the divine attributes, which they
divide into three principal cla&s;&s;es. Under the name of BRIMHA, they
wor&s;hip the wi&s;dom and creative power of God; under the appellation of
BISHEN, his providential and pre&s;erving quality; and under that of SHIBAH,
that attribute which tends to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem of wor&s;hip, &s;ay the Brahmins, ari&s;es from two
opinions. The fir&s;t is, that as God is immaterial, and con&s;equently
invi&s;ible, it is impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e a pro|per idea of him, by any
image in the human mind. The &s;econd is, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike
the gro&s;s ideas of man, with &s;ome emblems of God's attributes, otherwi&s;e,
that all &s;en&s;e of religion will naturally vani&s;h from the mind. They, for
this purpo&s;e, have <PB N="lxviii" REF="77"> made &s;ymbolical
repre&s;entations of the three cla&s;&s;es of the divine attributes; but they
aver, that they do not believe them to be &s;eparate intelligences. BRIMH, or
the &s;upreme divinity, has a thou&s;and names; but the Hindoos would think it
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impiety to repre&s;ent him under any form. 
<Q REND="inline">"The human mind, &s;ay they, may form &s;ome conception
of his attributes &s;eparately, but who can gra&s;p the whole, within the
circle of finite ideas."</Q></P>
<P>That in any age or country, human rea&s;on was ever &s;o depraved as to
wor&s;hip the work of hands, for the creator of the univer&s;e, we believe to
be an ab&s;olute deception, which aro&s;e from the vanity of the abettors of
particular &s;y&s;tems of religion. To attentive inquirers into the human mind,
it will appear, that common &s;en&s;e, upon the affairs of religion, is pretty
equally divided among all nations. Revelation and philo&s;ophy have, it is
confe&s;&s;ed, lopped off &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious ex|cre&s;cences
and ab&s;urdities that naturally ari&s;e in weak minds, upon a &s;ubject &s;o
my&s;terious: but it is much to be doubted, whether the want of tho&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary pu|rifiers of religion, ever involved any nation in gro&s;s
ido|latry, as many ignorant zealots have pretended.</P>
<P>In India, as well as in many other countries, there are two religious
&s;ects; the one look up to the divinity, through the medium of rea&s;on and
philo&s;ophy; while the others receive, as an article of their belief, every
holy legend and allegory which have been tran&s;mitted down from antiquity.
From a fundamental article in the Hindoo <PB N="lxix" REF="78"> faith, that God
is <HI>the &s;oul of the world,</HI> and is con&s;e|quently diffu&s;ed through
all nature, the vulgar revere all the elements, and con&s;equently every great
natural object, as containing a portion of God; nor is the infi|nity of the
&s;upreme being, ea&s;ily comprehended by weak minds, without falling into this
error. This vene|ration for different objects, has, no doubt, given ri&s;e
among the common Indians, to an idea of &s;ubaltern intelligences; but the
learned Brahmins, with one voice, deny the exi&s;tence of inferior divinities;
and, indeed, all their religious books of any antiquity, confirm that
a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<P>AGUNNI, or the God of fire, hath thirty-five names. Bir|ren, or the

<P>Such is the &s;trange &s;y&s;tem of religion which prie&s;tcraft has
impo&s;ed on the vulgar, ever ready in all climes and ages to take advantage of
&s;uper&s;titious minds. There is one thing however to be &s;aid in favour of
the Hindoo doctrine, that while it teaches the pure&s;t morals, it is
&s;y&s;tematically formed on philo&s;ophical opnions. Let us therefore no
longer imagine half the world more ignorant than the &s;tones which they &s;eem

religion may be, the &s;elf-&s;ame infinite Being is the object of univer&s;al
adoration.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their divi&s;ion of time.</NOTE>The Hindoos divide
the age of the world into four grand periods or jugs: the Sat Jug, the Treta
Jug, the Duapur Jug, and the Cal Jug. They believe that when the Cal Jug is
fini&s;hed, the Sat Jug will com|mence again, and that thus time will revolve
in eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Sat Jug is &s;aid to have been a period of
fourteen millions and four hundred thou&s;and years, and it is repre&s;ented as
the age of felicity, in which there was nothing but truth, religion,
happine&s;s, peace, plenty, and independence; and that the life of man extended
to one hundred thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>The Treta Jug is &s;aid to contain one million and eighty thou&s;and
years, in which, it is &s;aid, that in the compo&s;ition of mankind, there were
three fourths truth, and one fourth fal&s;ehood, and that the age of man
extended to ten thou&s;and years. The Duapur Jug is &s;aid to contain &s;eventy
two thou&s;and years, in which two parts of the com|po&s;ition of man were
truth, and two parts fal&s;ehood, his age extend|ing to one thou&s;and years.
The Cal Jug contains thirty &s;ix thou&s;and years, in which period three
fourths of the compo&s;ition of man con|&s;i&s;ted of fal&s;hood, and only one
fourth of truth, his age being one hundred years.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brimha creates the world.</NOTE>It is the opinion
of the Hindoos, that God fir&s;t created five ele|ments; Fire, Water, Air,
Earth, and Aka&s;h, or a Cele&s;tial Ele|ment of which the heavens are made. He
afterwards created a kind of being endued with perfect wi&s;dom, whom he called
Brimha, and commanded him to make the world. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and mankind.</NOTE>When Brimha had created mankind
out of nothing, he divided them into four tribes; the Brah|min, the Kittri, the
Bi&s;e, and the Sudur. The fir&s;t tribe were to be prie&s;ts, to direct man in
the ways of God; the &s;econd rulers and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of the earth; the
third labourers; and the fourth trade&s;men and &s;ervants; which divi&s;ion is
&s;trictly maintained to this day.</P>
<P> <PB N="3" REF="89"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Author of the Bedas.</NOTE>Brimha, &s;ay they,
wrote a book which he called the Beda, by the order of God, in which he
affirms, that all things were originally God, and that all things &s;hall be
re&s;olved into him again; that hap|pine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in virtue, and that
vice will be puni&s;hed with mi&s;ery. To regulate the ceremonies of religion,
and to in&s;truct men how to govern the world, he has in the Beda given a canon
of laws, founded upon the principles of ju&s;tice. But as the Bedas are covered
with a veil of darkne&s;s by the Brahmins, we cannot &s;ay much more for
cer|tain concerning them. The Hindoos affirm, that Brimha lives for ever, or,
as &s;ome &s;ay, one hundred years, in which each day is com|puted at four
hundred revolutions of the Jugs. We &s;hall here give a &s;pecimen of the early
hi&s;tory of the Hindoos.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Specimen of the ancient hi&s;tory of the
Hindoos.</NOTE>It is recorded in the Mahabarit, that about the middle of the
third period, there was a Raja of the tribe of Kittiri, in the city of
Hi&s;|tinapoor, who&s;e name was Birt. He ruled the kingdom of Hindo|&s;tan,
and his i&s;&s;ue after him in lineal de&s;cent for eight generations, in peace
and tranquillity. The ninth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, who&s;e name was Kour, we are
told, founded the city of that name, which is now called Tanna&s;&s;ar, and is
about 70 crores from Delhi. He was the father of the tribe who are &s;till
called Kours.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ditara&s;hter being blind, his brother &s;ucceeds
to the throne.</NOTE>In the thirteenth generation from Kour, Chitterbourge
reigned, and was e&s;teemed a great prince. He had two &s;ons, one named
Ditara&s;hter, and the other Pind. But when Ditara&s;hter grew up, he became
blind, and therefore his father left the kingdom to his younger &s;on, who had
five children; Judi&s;hter, Brim&s;ein, and Arjun, by one wife, and Nucul and
Sedive, by another woman. But his elder brother Ditara&s;hter had &s;ons one
hundred and one, by a variety of women, among whom one was named Jirjodin,
being the elde&s;t of his children by the fir&s;t wife, and another was called
Jutu&s;h, being his fir&s;t born by a &s;econd &s;pou&s;e. In &s;hort, when
Pind died, the in|heritance <PB N="4" REF="90"> de&s;cended by right to the
heirs of his elder brother Ditar|a&s;hter, &s;o that Jirjodin became king.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between their children.</NOTE>But the
children of Pind regarded Jirjodin as an enemy, and waited an opportunity to
dive&s;t him of his authority. Ditara&s;hter, fearing di&s;tur|bances,
advi&s;ed his &s;on to build a palace without the city for the &s;ons of Pind,
in which for &s;ome time they con&s;ented to re&s;ide. In the mean time
Jirjodin had privately ordered the workmen who built this palace to fill up
&s;everal vaults with combu&s;tibles, and hired an old woman to &s;et fire to
them, at a proper opportunity. But the plot being di&s;covered accidentally by
the &s;ons of Pind, they them&s;elves &s;et fire to the mine, and burnt the old
woman and her five &s;ons in the flames, while they privately withdrew into the
wilderne&s;s, where they remained for &s;ome time, the king imagining they had
been de&s;troyed in the fire.</P>

Cum|pula, where they wedded Diropti, the Raja's daughter, with whom they lived
by turns, for the &s;pace of &s;eventeen days. In a &s;hort time, however, it
was noi&s;ed abroad, that the &s;ons of Pind were not dead, as was
&s;uppo&s;ed, which reaching the ears of the king, he ordered enquiry to be
made, and found that truth was in the report. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are invited to court.</NOTE>Anxious to have them
again in his power, he wrote to them affectionate letters, inviting them to
Hi&s;tinapoor, to &s;hare with him the inheritance of their forefathers. They
were at length prevailed upon by his fair promi&s;es, returned to court, and
were treated in every re&s;pect becom|ing their dignity. A part of the kingdom
was allotted for their main|tenance, for upon their arrival they became &s;o
much beloved by the people and nobility, that the king was afraid to lay
violent hands upon them. Their popularity daily increa&s;ing, and their party
being &s;trengthened by many of the principal nobility, they at length openly
in&s;i&s;ted upon a divi&s;ion of the empire in their favour, which the king
being in no condition to refu&s;e, complied with without he&s;itation.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 436.</NOTE>RAMDEO was of the tribe of
Rhator, a prince bold, wi&s;e, and generous. The fir&s;t thing he did on his
acce&s;&s;ion, was to exterminate by degrees the chiefs and Rajas who
a&s;&s;umed indepen|dency, and rai&s;ed factions in the empire. Then he
advanced with his army towards Marvar, and recovered that country from the
tribe of Cutchwa, whom he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and peopled it with that of
Rhator, from which time they have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are the Mahrattas, who at pre&s;ent make &s;uch a figure

precincts of Rhotas which they &s;till inhabit. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His great actions.</NOTE>Ramdeo Rhator, after
the&s;e tran&s;actions, returned and marched towards Lucknouti, which he took
and gave to his nephew. Here great wealth fell into his hands, and after an
expedition of three years he returned to Kinnoge, where he remained two years,
and then marched his army towards Malava, which he conquered, and putting it in
the hands of his Vizier, ordered many cities and towns to be built in that
province. Having repaired the fort of Narvar, he appointed one of his kin&s;men
governor, and demanded the daugh|ter of the Raja of Bijanagur in marriage, who,
fearing the power of Ramdeo, complied. He remained in the city of Gundwara two
years, where he &s;lew many of the rebellious Zemindars, then return|ing to
Kinnoge &s;pent &s;even years in fe&s;tivity and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ramdeo afterwards went unto the mountains of Sawalic, and reduced
all the Rajas of tho&s;e parts; particularly the Raja of Comaoon, who&s;e
ance&s;tors, according to the fabulous hi&s;tory of the Hindoos, had reigned
there ten thou&s;and years. This Raja had drawn toge|ther a powerful army, with
which he engaged Ramdeo in &s;everal great battles; &s;o that for &s;ome time
the war was doubtful. At length the fortune of Ramdeo prevailed, and the Raja
of Comaoon was forced to abandon his wealth, and take refuge in the
inacce&s;&s;ible mountains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mountains of Comaoon lye
about two hundred miles North from Delhi.</NOTE>. His wives and daughters fell
into the hands of Ramdeo, who having &s;oftened him to compa&s;&s;ion, he
re&s;tored to the Raja his country, and turned his face towards Nagracut,
plundering the country, till he reached Scutdimmindi. There he halted out of
re&s;pect to the temple of Bowani<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bowani is one
of the names of the Godde&s;s Pirkirti, concerning whom &s;ee the
di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to this hi&s;tory.</NOTE>, which was built near the
&s;ort of Nagracut, &s;ending a per&s;on to call the Raja before him. The Raja
afraid for his life, delayed for &s;ome time till he had received proper 
<PB N="30" REF="116"> a&s;&s;urances of per&s;onal &s;afety, by the mediation
of a Brahmin; and then he waited on the King, and exhibited the cu&s;toms of
obedience. Ramdeo went to pay his adoration to the idol, to whom he made rich
offerings, then retiring, demanded the daughter of the Raja in marriage for his
&s;on, and marched to the fort of Jummu. The Raja of Jummu being &s;trong in
troops and well &s;upplied with money and provi&s;ions, confiding in the
&s;trength of his fort and the inacce&s;&s;ible|ne&s;s of the roads leading
towards it, de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;ummons of the King, and refu&s;ed to bend to
his commands, preparing him&s;elf for war. But in the fir&s;t encounter in the
field, his irregular troops, though &s;ingly brave, were di&s;comfited before
the united powers of the King, who driving him within his walls, immediately
inve&s;ted the place, and &s;torming it in a few days, impri&s;oned what part
of the garri&s;on e&s;caped the &s;word, and in the fort found great
wealth.</P>
<P>The Raja having previou&s;ly fled into the mountains, &s;aw no hope
but in peace, and therefore &s;ollicited the mercy of the King. Ram|deo
rein&s;tated him, taking one of his daughters for his &s;econd &s;on. Directing
his march from thence to the banks of the river Nerbet, which falls from the
mountains of Ca&s;hmire into the di&s;tricts of Pun|jaab, he traver&s;ed the
country of Hindo&s;tan to the &s;alt &s;ea of Bengal, where the great mountains
of Sewalic pre&s;s upon the ocean. He accompli&s;hed this march in five months,
having reduced near five hundred di&s;obedient Rajas and Zemindars. He
plundered them of their wealth, and then turned his victorious &s;tandards
towards his capital of Kinnoge, which he entered in pomp and triumph.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after prepared a magnificent fe&s;tival, and divided the
&s;poil among his &s;oldiers, the &s;hare of each being forty pieces of gold.
Be&s;ides a third part of the &s;poil was thrown among the people. From this
time forward he repo&s;ed upon the throne of ea&s;e and mag|nificence, nor ever
afterwards mounted the hor&s;e of war to hunt for further conque&s;ts. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dies.</NOTE>After he had reigned fifty four years,
he followed <PB N="31" REF="117"> his ance&s;tors to the unknown world, from

<P>Subuctagi was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e terms, but his &s;on,
Sultan Mamood, who was an ambitious young man, fearing this would put an end to
his expedition, prevailed with his father to reject the propo&s;al. Jeipal,
upon this, told him that the cu&s;toms of the Raja|puts were of &s;uch a

in the end, pay very dear for his victories. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and when

de&s;pair, and con&s;ented to let them retreat upon their paying a million of
Dirms, and pre|&s;enting him with fifty elephants. Jeipal not being able to

they have not yet forgot the terror of their enemy's arms; and Jeipal may

was, therefore, the opinion of the double council, to com|ply &s;trictly with
the terms of the peace, that the people might enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of
tranquillity; but the King was ob&s;tinate, and would not hearken to their
advice.</P>
<P>Intelligence of what was done, &s;oon reached the ears of Subuctagi;
like a foaming torrent he ha&s;tened towards Hindo&s;tan with a nume|rous army,
to take revenge upon Jeipal for his treacherous behaviour; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renews the war,</NOTE>Jeipal al&s;o collected his
forces, and marched forth to meet him; for the neighbouring Rajas,

a wolf among a flock of goats: Calling there|fore together his chiefs, he
encouraged them to glory, and honoured them di&s;tinctly with his commands. His
troops, though few in number, he divided into &s;quadrons of five hundred each,
which he ordered one after another, to the attack in a circle, &s;o that a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and is de|feated.</NOTE>The Hindoos being wor&s;e
mounted than the cavalry of Subuctagi, could effect nothing again&s;t them;
&s;o that wearied out with this manner of fighting, confu&s;ion became

and were pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter to the banks of the river Nilaab;
where many, who had e&s;caped the edge of the &s;word, peri&s;hed by their fear

<P>Subuctagi acquired in this action much glory and wealth; for

in the countries of Limghaan and Pe&s;hawir, and annexed them to his own
dominions, joined them to his titles, and &s;tamped their names, as was

was appointed to the government of Pe&s;hawir; and the Afghans who re&s;ided
among the mountains, having promi&s;ed allegiance, he entertained &s;ome

<P>As the &s;ea&s;on was now too far advanced for action, it was agreed
that Subuctagi &s;hould return, during the winter, to Ghizni, and prepare his
forces to act in conjunction with tho&s;e of Amir Noo in the &s;pring. But when
Amir Ali Sumjure, prince of Chora&s;&s;an, at who&s;e court Faek was then in
treaty, heard of the alliance formed between Amir Noo and Subuctagi, he began

art of government required years, experience, wi&s;dom and knowledge, in the
affairs of &s;tate, which I&s;maiel could not po&s;&s;ibly pretend to
po&s;&s;e&s;s, though Subuc|tagi had appointed him to &s;ucceed to the throne
in the ab&s;ence of Mamood. He therefore advi&s;ed I&s;mael &s;eriou&s;ly to
con&s;ider the mat|ter, to di&s;tingui&s;h propriety from impropriety, and to
give up his title to government without further di&s;pute, which would
re&s;tore him to the love and genero&s;ity of Mamood; for that it was his

&s;hut his ears again&s;t all the propo&s;als of his brother, and prepared for

Sultan Mamood &s;aw no remedy but in war, and attaching his uncle

&s;tandards towards Ghizni, while Amir I&s;maiel ha&s;tened al&s;o from Balich

Mamood took great pains to avoid coming to extremities, and in vain tried to
recon|cile matters in an amicable manner. He was therefore forced to form his
troops in order of battle, while Amir I&s;maiel al&s;o extended the lines of
war, which he &s;upported by a chain of elephants. Both armies un&s;heathing
their &s;teel, commenced &s;uch a &s;laughter that the &s;words wept blood.
Sultan Mamood at length charged the center of the enemy with &s;uch fury that

Amir I&s;maiel was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of treating about a

him&s;elf, and delivered up the keys of the garri&s;on and the trea&s;ury to
Sultan Mamood.</P>
<P>Mamood having appointed a new mini&s;try, and regulated the

acce&s;&s;ion illuminated the earth with the bright torch of ju&s;tice, and
cheri&s;hed it with the beams of beneficence. Others inform us, that in his
di&s;|po&s;ition, <PB N="53" REF="139"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 997. Higer. 387.</NOTE>the &s;ordid vice of
avarice found place, which however could not darken the other bright qualities
of his mind. A certain poet &s;ays, that his wealth was like a pearl in the
&s;hell; but as poets hunt after wit rather than truth, therefore we mu&s;t
judge of Mamood by his actions, from which it appears that he was indeed a
prince of great oeconomy, but that he never withheld his genero&s;ity upon a
ju&s;t and proper occa&s;ion. We have the te&s;timony of the Fatti Bilad, wrote
by Abu Ni&s;ir Mu&s;cati, and of the famous Abul Fazil, that no King had ever
more learned men at his court, kept a finer army, or di&s;played more
magnificence than Sultan Mamood. All the&s;e things could not be done without
expence; &s;o that the &s;tigma of avarice mu&s;t have been owing to two
particular circum&s;tances of his life, which ought by no means to have
&s;tamped his general character with that &s;ordid vice.</P>
<P>The two circum&s;tances in a few words were the&s;e. Having a great
propen&s;ity to poetry, in which he made &s;ome tolerable progre&s;s him&s;elf,
he promi&s;ed Sheck Phirdoci a golden mher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mher is
about fourteen rupees; this coin was called mher from having a &s;un &s;tampt
upon it. Mher &s;ignifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, in
the Per&s;ian.</NOTE> for every ver&s;e of an heroic poem which he was
de&s;irous to patronize. Under the protection of this promi&s;e, that divine
poet wrote the un|paralleled poem called the Shaw Namma, which con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;ixty thou&s;and couplets. When he pre&s;ented it to the King, he repented of
his promi&s;e, telling the poet, that he thought &s;ixty thou&s;and rupees
might &s;atisfy him for a work which he &s;eemed to have per|formed with &s;o
much ea&s;e and expedition. Phirdoci ju&s;tly offended at this indignity, could
never be brought to accept of any reward, though Sultan Mamood would after
reflection have gladly paid him the &s;um originally &s;tipulated; the poet,
however, took ample revenge in a &s;atire of &s;even hundred couplets which he
wrote upon that occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>We have already ob&s;erved that the father of Sultan Mamood was

the Higerah, and as the a&s;trologers &s;ay, with many happy omens
expre&s;&s;ed in the hero&s;cope of his fate. Subuctagi being a&s;leep at the
time of his birth, dreamed that he beheld a green tree &s;pringing forth from
his chimney, which threw its &s;hadow over the face of the earth, and
&s;creened from the &s;torms of heaven the whole animal creation. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ju&s;tice.</NOTE>This indeed was verified by
the ju&s;tice of Mamood; for if we can believe the poet, in his reign the wolf

Tahera, which was fortified with an exceeding high wall, and a deep broad

<P>It is &s;aid that the Sultan found in Muttra five great idols of
pure gold, with eyes of rubies, each of which eyes were worth fifty thou|&s;and
dinars. Upon another idol, he found a &s;apphire, weighing four hundred

three hundred mi&s;kal of pure gold. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were above a

Sultan, having tarried here twenty days, in which time the city &s;uffered
greatly from fire, be&s;ides what it &s;uffered from the hand of ravage and
de&s;olation, he marched again&s;t the other fortified places in the&s;e

a pre&s;ent to the Caliph of Bagdat, Al Kadir Billa Aba&s;&s;i. We, however,
believe, that this &s;tory ro&s;e from the policy of Mamood, and the credulity
of mankind, rather than that it had actually any foundation in truth. Other
authors mention a &s;tone which he brought from Hindo&s;tan, as a great

from the walls of Sumnat, that therefore it could &s;erve no purpo&s;e to

<P>Among the &s;poils of this temple, was a chain of gold weighing

<P>Sultan Mamood found in this temple, a greater quantity of jewels and
gold, than, it is thought, any royal trea&s;ury ever contained be|fore. In the

Byram Deo, after the taking of Sumnat, had fled from Narwalla the capital of

intended to fit out a fleet for the conque&s;t of tho&s;e parts, but that he

this country from his other dominions, and the number of troops it would
require for its defence, they thought it advi&s;eable, that &s;ome one of the

of the natives, and was informed that the family of Dabi&s;&s;alima was the
noble&s;t in tho&s;e parts, and that then a man of parts and di&s;tinction of
that tribe, was in his camp, in the habit of a Brahmin. That they knew no

him to explain his complaint, which he thus did: That, unfortunately having a

came to his hou&s;e every night with armed attendants, beating him and turn|ing
him into the &s;treet till he had gratified his adulterous pa&s;&s;ion. That he

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his ju&s;tice.</NOTE>The King, upon hearing
this, was &s;o much enraged that tears of re&s;entment and compa&s;&s;ion
&s;tarted from his eyes; he repri|manded the poor man for not making &s;ooner
his complaint to him. The man replied, that he often attempted it, but could
not gain ad|mittance. He was then commanded by the King, to return to his
hou&s;e, and to give him notice the fir&s;t time that his nephew was guilty of
the like violence; charging tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, upon pain of death, to
let nothing of this complaint tran&s;pire, ordering him to be admitted at any
hour. Accordingly the man returned to his hou&s;e, and upon the third night
following, the King's nephew, as u&s;ual, came, and having whipped the
hu&s;band &s;everely, turned him into the &s;treet. The poor man ha&s;tened to
the King; but the captain of the guards would not give him admittance,
&s;aying, that his Maje&s;ty was in the Haram. The man immediately began to
make a violent outery, &s;o that the porter fearing that the court might be
di&s;turbed, and that the noi&s;e might reach the King, he was under the
nece&s;&s;ity to conduct him to the Eunuchs of the bedchamber, who immedi|ately
acquainted the Sultan with the affair.</P>
<P>The King immediately ro&s;e, and drawing on a garment followed the
man to his hou&s;e. He found his nephew and the man's wife <PB N="96" REF="182"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</NOTE>&s;leeping together
in one bed, with a candle &s;tanding on the carpet near them. The Sultan,
extingui&s;hing the candle, drew his dagger and &s;evered his nephew's head
from his body: Then commanding the man to light the candle, he called out for
&s;ome water, and having taken a deep draught, he told him he might now go and
&s;leep with &s;afety, if he could tru&s;t his own wife.</P>
<P>The poor man fell down at the Sultan's feet, in gratitude to his
ju&s;tice and conde&s;cen&s;ion, but begged he might tell him why he put out
the candle, and afterwards called out &s;o vehemently for water. The King
replied, that he put out the candle that pity might not arre&s;t his hand in
the execution of ju&s;tice, on a youth whom he tenderly loved; and that he had
made a vow to God, when he fir&s;t heard his complaint, that he would neither
eat nor drink till he had brought the criminal to ju&s;tice, in &s;o much, that
he was upon the point of dying of thir&s;t.</P>

but Phirdoci falling &s;ick by too much application, before it was fini&s;hed,
he applied him&s;elf to his old ma&s;ter A&s;&s;idi; telling him that he was
now at the point of death, and that his only regret for leaving this vain world
was, that his poem was unfini&s;hed. The old man weeping replied, that, tho' he

Phirdoci the author, con&s;e|quently among the fir&s;t of poets.</P>
<P>Minuchere was an Omrah of Balich, and famous for his poetry and wit.
But Hakim Ali Un&s;uri is e&s;teemed to hold the fir&s;t rank, as to genius, in
that age; for be&s;ides being one of the be&s;t poets, he was a great
philo&s;opher, ver&s;ed in all the known &s;ciences, and all the learned
languages of tho&s;e times. Four hundred poets and learned men, be&s;ides all
the &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity of Ghizni, acknow|ledged him for their

and it was ordered, that no per|formance &s;hould be brought before the Sultan,
without being pre|viou&s;ly honoured with the approbation of Ali Un&s;uri.</P>
<P>Among the works of Un&s;uri there is an heroic poem, upon the
actions of Sultan Mamood. The King having one night, in his cups, cut off the
long tre&s;&s;es of his beloved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His favourite
mi&s;tre&s;s.</NOTE>, he was much afflicted in the morning for what he had
done. He &s;at, he ro&s;e, he walked by turns, and there was a terror round
him, which kept the people at di&s;tance. <PB N="98" REF="184">

beauty of the lines con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in a happy chime of words, which
cannot po&s;&s;ibly be imitated in a tran&s;lation. The &s;en&s;e runs thus: On
this happy day, when the tre&s;&s;es of your beloved are cut off, what place is
there for grief? Let it be rather crowned with mirth and wine, for the beauty
of the cypre&s;s is increa&s;ed by the pruning of it's branches.</NOTE>, which
&s;o plea&s;ed the King that he ordered his mouth to be filled three times with
jewels. Calling then for wine, he &s;at down with the poet and wa&s;hed down
his grief, &s;ea&s;oning &s;ociety with wit.</P>
<P>Asjuddi was one of the &s;cholars of Un&s;uri: He was a native of
Hirvi, a poet ble&s;&s;ed with the light of true genius, but his works are very
&s;carce and the greate&s;t part of them lo&s;t. Firochi was al&s;o a pupil of
Un&s;uri. He was of the antient royal race of the Kings of Sei&s;tan, but
reduced by fortune &s;o low, that he was obliged to hire him&s;elf to a farmer
for the yearly wages of a hundred Dirms. When he married, he found this &s;mall
&s;um would not an&s;wer his expences, &s;o he became de&s;irous of having his
wages increa&s;ed. The farmer told him he certainly de&s;erved a great deal
more, but that his capacity could not extend the allowance further. Firochi, in
this &s;tate of dependence, waited on the Sultan's nephew Abul Muziffir with a
poem, for which he was honoured with a hand|&s;ome reward, with a hor&s;e and a
dre&s;s. He was introduced to the King by Muziffir, who &s;ettled a pen&s;ion
upon him which enabled him to ride with a retinue of twenty well mounted

Feroch Zaad became the inhabitant of another world, Sultan Ibrahim a&s;cended
the throne of empire: A King remarkable for morality and devotion, having in
the flower of his youth, amid&s;t a paradi&s;e of plea&s;ure, conquered all the
&s;en&s;ual appe|tites, and added two months more to the fea&s;t of Ramzan,

opened the hand of charity to the poor. This prince excelled in the art of fine
writing, and in the libraries of Mecca and Medina, there are two copies of the
Koran wrote by his own hand, which were &s;ent as pre&s;ents to the
Caliph.&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with the Turkumans.</NOTE>In the fir&s;t

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1058. Higer. 450.</NOTE>all the countries
they had &s;eized, upon condition that they would not lengthen the hand of

&s;on Mu&s;aood, to the daughter of their King, Malleck Shaw, which opened the
door of friend&s;hip and intercour&s;e between the two nations.</P>
<P>We are told, that before this peace was concluded, Malleck Shaw had
collected a great army, with an intention to invade Ghizni, which greatly
intimidated Ibrahim, as he was not then in a condi|tion to oppo&s;e him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of Ibrahim.</NOTE>But knowing that policy
is &s;ometimes a good &s;ub&s;titute for &s;trength, he wrote letters to the
principal Omrahs of Malleck Shaw's army, which he di&s;patched by a
me&s;&s;enger who had received his in&s;tructions how to proceed. The purport
of tho&s;e letters was to importune the Omrahs, to whom they were directed, to
ha&s;ten the King's march to Ghizni, le&s;t their &s;cheme &s;hould be
prematurely di&s;covered; and that they might depend upon his fulfilling his
en|gagements to their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of the Turkomans deceived.</NOTE>The
me&s;&s;enger accordingly took an opportunity one day, when Malleck Shaw was
hunting, upon the road to Ghizni, to come running towards him; but upon
di&s;covering the King, he &s;tole &s;lowly away, which creating &s;u&s;picion,
he was pur&s;ued by &s;ome hor&s;emen, and brought before the King. He was
immediately &s;earched, and the pacquet was found upon him; though he had
previou&s;ly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;everely ba&s;tinadoed, without
confe&s;&s;ing any thing. The King having read the&s;e letters, the power of
the &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;pira|tors was &s;uch, that there was great danger in
accu&s;ing them; but it rai&s;ed &s;uch a diffidence in his mind, that he, from
that time, was de&s;irous of peace, and gave over all thoughts of his
expedition.</P>
<P>When the mind of Ibrahim was quieted from any apprehen&s;ions from
that quarter, he &s;ent an army towards Hindo&s;tan, and con|quered 
<PB N="130" REF="216"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1079. Higer. 472.</NOTE>many places in that
country, which before had not been vi&s;ited by the Mu&s;&s;ulman arms. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibrahim's ex|pedition to Hindo&s;tan.</NOTE>In the
year 472, he marched him|&s;elf towards that country, and extended his
conque&s;ts to the fort of Ajodin, called now Palan&s;hukurgunge. This place
being taken, he turned to another fort called Rupal, which was built upon the
&s;ummit of a &s;teep hill; a river enclo&s;ed it on three &s;ides, and a
&s;mall penin&s;ula joined it to the other hills, which were entirely covered
with an impervious wood, and much infe&s;ted by venemous &s;erpents. This,
however, did not di&s;courage the Sultan from his attempt. He ordered &s;ome
thou&s;and hatchet men to clear the wood, which they effected in &s;pite of all
oppo&s;ition; and the rock being &s;oft, the miners forced their way in a
&s;hort time under the walls, which were brought down in ruins. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Rupal.</NOTE>The place was immediately
taken, and the garri&s;on made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>He marched from thence to another town in the neighbourhood, the
inhabitants of which came originally from Chorra&s;&s;an, and were bani&s;hed
thither, with their families, by Afran&s;iab<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A
name common to a long race of Per&s;ian Kings.</NOTE>, for frequent rebellions.
Here they formed them&s;elves into a &s;mall independant &s;tate, being
encircled by impa&s;&s;ible mountains; and had pre&s;erved their ancient
cu&s;toms and rites, without intermarrying with any other people. The Sultan
having, with infinite labour, cleared a road for his army over the mountains,
advanced towards the town, which was well fortified. He was overtaken by the
rainy &s;ea&s;on, and his army was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; during three
months he was obliged to remain idle before it. But when the rains began to
abate, and the country to dry up, he &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender, and
acknowledge the faith.</P>
<P>Ibrahim's propo&s;als being rejected he commenced the &s;iege, which
continued &s;ome weeks, with great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. The 
<PB N="131" REF="217"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1079. Higer. 472.</NOTE>town at length was
taken by a&s;&s;ault, and the Mu&s;&s;ulmen found much wealth within it, and
one hundred thou&s;and unfortunate per|&s;ons, whom they carried bound to
Ghizni. Some time after, the King accidentally &s;aw one of tho&s;e unhappy men
carrying a heavy &s;tone with great difficulty and labour, to a palace which
was then building. This awakened his pity; he commanded him to throw it down,
and gave him his liberty.</P>
<P>This &s;tone happened to lie upon the public road, and proved
trouble&s;ome to pa&s;&s;engers; but as the King's rigid adherence to his
commands was univer&s;ally known, none would attempt to remove it. A courtier
one day, having &s;tumbled with his hor&s;e over this &s;tone, took occa&s;ion
to mention it to the King; in&s;inuating, that he thought, if his Maje&s;ty
plea&s;ed, that it were advi&s;able to have it re|moved. To which the King
replied; 
<Q REND="inline">"I have commanded it to be thrown there, and there
it mu&s;t remain; as a memorial of the misfor|tunes of war, and my own pity:
For it is better for a King to be ob&s;tinate, even in his inadvertencies, than
to break his royal word."</Q> The &s;tone was accordingly permitted to remain,
where it is &s;hewn as a curio&s;ity to this day.</P>
<P>Sultan Ibrahim had thirty &s;ix &s;ons and forty daughters. The
lat|ter he gave in marriage to learned and religious men. In the year 492, he
left this mortal &s;tate, after having reigned in tranquility and happine&s;s
forty two years. In his time flouri&s;hed Abul Farrhe, who was a native of
Sei&s;tan, according to &s;ome, but as others affirm, of Ghizni. He is
e&s;teemed a ma&s;ter in poetry; and the famous An|&s;uri was one of his

of great fame. Many books were, in this reign, tran&s;lated from various
languages, into the Per|&s;ian tongue; among the mo&s;t famous of which, was an
Hindoo book, called the Killila Dumna, a fabulous &s;tory, pregnant with
&s;ound morality, policy, and entertainment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A digre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>This book was &s;ent

&s;irnamed The Wi&s;e, was &s;o well ver&s;ed in all the known languages, that
in a few days he tran&s;lated the Killila Dumna into Phelevi or antient

San&s;crita language was entirely unknown in tho&s;e parts. But he could form
no conception of the che&s;s-board, as that game was, at that time, unknown in
Per&s;ia. He therefore had recour&s;e to the amba&s;&s;ador, who was e&s;teemed
the be&s;t player in Hindo&s;tan, to have this matter explained to him, who
having accordingly di&s;covered to him the principles, Buzurg Chimere &s;at
down with him to play. The fir&s;t game he obliged the amba&s;|&s;ador to draw;
the &s;econd he chaced his King &s;olitary; and the third he gave him

<P>The pre&s;ent of the che&s;s-board was intended as an experiment
upon the genius of the mini&s;ter, and to indicate that in the great game of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The origin of the hou&s;e of Ghor.</NOTE>MORCHAN
the hi&s;torian tells us, that about the time when Feredoon &s;ubdued Zohac
Tazi, two brothers of that family, Souri and Saam, were taken into favour by
the conqueror; but having by &s;ome means incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure, they
fled with a party of their friends to Hawind, where they took up their abode,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of a &s;mall territory. Souri took the
government of this di&s;trict, appointing his brother to the command of his
&s;mall army, and gave his daughter in marriage to his &s;on Suja.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja the fir&s;t of that race.</NOTE>Suja, after
his father's decea&s;e, enjoyed his place. But &s;ome pri|vate enemies having
traduced him to his uncle, in&s;pired him with jealou&s;y and enmity to &s;uch
a degree, that he wanted to take his daughter away from him. When Suja found
this, he was deter|mined to &s;eek his fortune el&s;ewhere. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies to the mountains of Ghor.</NOTE>He
accordingly, in the night, with ten hor&s;emen and a few camels, laden with his
effects, &s;et out, with his wife and children to the mountains of Ghor, where
he built a hou&s;e and called it Romejandi&s;h<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That is, Go without care.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here he was gradually joined by many of his friends, who built a
&s;trong fort, which he held out again&s;t the troops of Feredoon 
<PB N="144" REF="230"> for &s;ome time, but at length he was obliged to
&s;ubmit and pay tribute.</P>
<P>Thus the race of Zohac, one after another, &s;ucceeded to this

prophet, when it was ruled by Shin&s;ub, who, &s;ome &s;ay, was converted to

being late before they arrived, they could find no lodgings, and were obliged
to creep in under a balcony, where they might &s;leep out of the rain. The

innocent, which &s;oftened the &s;teely heart of the execu|tioner to pity. He
de&s;ired him to relate what he had to &s;ay in his own defence, which he did

This fort, as we have before related, was ineffectually be&s;ieged by Chu&s;ero

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Reign of Sultan CUTTUB UL DIEN ABIEK.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1205. Higer. 602.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttub ul dien Abiek,</NOTE>SULTAN Cuttub ul dien Abiek, was of a
brave and virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, open and liberal to his friends, and
courteous and affable to &s;trangers. In the art of war and government he was
infe|rior to none, nor was he a mean proficient in literature.</P>
<P>In his childhood he was brought from Turke&s;tan to Ni&s;hapoor, and
there &s;old by a merchant, to Ca&s;i Fuchur ul dien ben Abdu, Azizi Kufi, who,
finding that heaven had endued him with a great ge|nius, &s;ent him to
&s;chool, where he made a wonderful progre&s;s in the Per&s;ian and Arabic

But his patron and ma&s;ter dying &s;uddenly, he was &s;old as part of his
e&s;tate, by his relations, and bought by a rich merchant, for a great &s;um of
money, and pre&s;ented for &s;ale to Sultan Shab ul dien. The Sultan
purcha&s;ed him, and called his name Abiek, from having his little finger
broke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">his ri&s;e,</NOTE>He behaved him&s;elf in &s;uch a
becoming and a&s;&s;iduous manner, that he &s;oon attracted the notice of his
prince, and daily gained confidence and favour. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">genero&s;ity.</NOTE>One night the Sultan kept a
magnificent fe&s;tival at court, and ordered a liberal di&s;tribution of
pre&s;ents and money to be made among his &s;ervants. Abiek par|took largely of
his munificence, but had no &s;ooner retired, than he divided his &s;hare among
his companions. The Prince having heard of this circum&s;tance, a&s;ked him the
cau&s;e, and Abiek, ki&s;&s;ing the earth, replied; 
<Q REND="inline">"That all his wants were amply &s;upplied by his

<NOTE PLACE="marg">capacity,</NOTE>This an&s;wer &s;o plea&s;ed the
King, that he immediately gave him an office near his per&s;on, and in a little
time, was &s;o &s;atisfied with his diligence and capacity, that he appointed
him ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>When the princes of Ghor, Ghizni and Bamia had drawn their forces
towards Chorra&s;&s;an, in order to expel the Shaw, Sultan of Charizm, from
that province, Abiek went out with a detachment to forage on the banks of the
Murgaab. He was there &s;urrounded by a numerous party of the enemy. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and valour.</NOTE>But though he did the utmo&s;t
ju&s;tice to valour, he was, after the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of his men, taken
pri&s;oner, and carried to Charizm Shaw, who put him in chains. But the Shaw
being defeated, Abiek was left in this manner, &s;itting upon a camel in the
field, and carried to his victorious ma&s;ter; who pitying his condition,
received him with great kindne&s;s.</P>

it, and obliging them to rai&s;e the &s;iege, pur&s;ued them to their own

there a thou&s;and fine hor&s;es, and much &s;poil, and being informed of
Sultan Shab ul dien's expedition towards Kin|noge, he thought proper to proceed
as far as Pe&s;hawir, to meet him, pre&s;enting him with a hundred fine
hor&s;es, and two great elephants, one of which carried a chain of gold, and
the other a chain of &s;ilver. He mu&s;tered there, before the Sultan, fifty
thou&s;and hor&s;e, and was honoured with an honorary dre&s;s, and with the
command of the van of the royal army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats the Raja of Bena|ris.</NOTE>With the van
he defeated the Raja of Benaris, who, upon &s;eeing his army retreat, pu&s;hed
forward his elephant, in de&s;pair, again&s;t his enemy; but Cuttub ul dien,
who excelled in archery, &s;unk an arrow in the ball of his eye, which brought
him down from his ele|phant to the ground. It is &s;aid that the number of
&s;lain was &s;o great, that the body of the Raja for a long time could not be
found <PB N="167" REF="253"> by his friends, who were permitted to &s;earch for
it. But, at la&s;t, he was di&s;covered by his teeth, which, happening to be
bad, were &s;up|plied by artificial ones, fixed in by golden wedges and
wires.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien, following with the body of the army, entered
the city of Benaris, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, as far as the
boundaries of Bengal, without oppo&s;ition. He broke down all the idols, and
loaded four thou&s;and camels with the mo&s;t valuable &s;poils.</P>
<P>Cuttub ul dien pre&s;ented the King with above three hundred
ele|phants, taken from the Raja of Benaris. The riders had a &s;ignal given
them to make the elephants SELAM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to fall upon

almo&s;t killed his rider, when he endea|voured to force him to pay his
obedience.</P>
<P>The King, when he was &s;etting out for Ghizni, &s;ent the white

and when he died, the affectionate animal pined away with vi&s;ible &s;orrow,

have ever heard in Hindo&s;tan; but it is &s;aid, that the King of Pegu keeps
always two white ele|phants, and that, when one of them dies, he i&s;&s;ues out
an order over all his dominions, to &s;earch the woods for another to &s;upply
his place. Cuttub ul dien, after the departure of the King, remained &s;ome
days at A&s;&s;i, where the Raja's trea&s;ure was found.

Himrage's general, was marching with another army, towards Delhi, before which

<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Him|rage him&s;elf</NOTE>Himrage being joined
by his general, in confidence of his &s;uperior numbers, formed his army in
order of battle. When they came to blows, he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by
his bravery, as well as by his conduct; but, being &s;lain, his army took the
way of infamy before them. Thus Ajmere was re&s;tored to the Mahommedan
government, and was afterwards ruled by their laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ravages the territory of Narwalla.</NOTE>In the
year 590, Cuttub turned his arms towards Narwalla, and Setwan, the general of
Bimdeo, who was encamped under the walls, fled upon his approach. But being

his army re&s;umed their flight. Bimdeo, upon intelligence of this defeat, fled
from his dominions, and Cuttub ul dien ravaged the country at lei&s;ure, and
found much &s;poil. He marched from thence to the fort of Ha&s;&s;i, which he
repaired, then having vi&s;ited Koram, returned to Delhi.</P>
<P>He in the mean time received advice, from the governor of the
di&s;tricts near Rintimpore, that the brother of the Raja of Ajmere, who lived
in the hills, was marching down with an army to invade him. This obliged Cuttub
ul dien to move immediately to his relief. The enemy, upon hearing this, fled;
and Cuttub paid a vi&s;it to Raja Gola, who entertained him magnificently, and
at his departure, pre&s;ented him with &s;ome fine jewels, and two melons of
gold. When he had &s;ettled the country, he again returned to Delhi,

Cuttub ul dien pur&s;ued them to Narwalla, in the year 593, taking in his way

Guzerat, and ravaged that country without further oppo&s;ition, taking the city
of Narwalla, where an Omrah with a &s;trong garri&s;on was left. He then
returned to Delhi, by the way of Ajmere, and &s;ent a great quantity of jewels

<P>In the year 599, he mu&s;tered his forces and marched to the &s;iege
of Calinger, where he was met by the Raja of that country, whom he defeated;

propo&s;al was accepted, but the Vizier, who wanted to hold out without coming
to any terms, found means to make away with the Raja, while the pre&s;ents were
preparing to be &s;ent. The flag of ho&s;tility was again hoi&s;ted upon the
fort, and the &s;iege recommenced. The place, however, was in a &s;hort time

&s;upplied the garri&s;on with water. There is a tradition among the natives of
the place, that the above fountain always dries up upon the di&s;charging the

have &s;ome foundation. But we are rather tempted to believe, that the

Shinoran, which lay between Ghizni and Hindo&s;tan. His &s;ituation gave him an
opportunity of frequently entertaining his prince, upon his expeditions to and
from that country, which he always did with great magnificence and fe&s;tivity,
making pre&s;ents to all the King's attendants.</P>
<P>Sultan Shab ul dien, in his la&s;t expedition, &s;avoured Taje ul

&s;hould &s;ucceed to that throne. But upon the death of that monarch, the
Turki&s;h Omrahs were de&s;irous that Sultan Yeas ul dien ben Sham &s;hould
come from Ghor and reign at Ghizni. Yeas ul dien being a man of an indolent

content to maintain the appearance of that power which he would not, or rather
dur&s;t not enforce.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing Taje ul dien Eldoze did after his acce&s;&s;ion,
was to invade Punjab and Lahore, as we have &s;een in the former reign. He was
defeated by Cuttub ul dien Abiek, and in con&s;equence lo&s;t his own kingdom,
which, however, he &s;oon after recovered. He afterwards, in conjunction with

always found &s;ome opportunity of &s;up|plying the place, he ordered &s;mall

was effectually blockaded. Yet it held out for near a whole year, when being

<P>In the retinue of tho&s;e princes, were the mo&s;t famous men for
learning, war, arts and &s;ciences, that A&s;ia at that time produced. The
court of Hindo&s;tan was therefore, in the days of Balin, reckoned the mo&s;t
polite and magnificent in the world. All the philo&s;ophers, poets and divines,
formed a &s;ociety every night, at the hou&s;e of Chan Sheh&icirc;d, the heir
apparent of the Empire; and Amir Chu&s;ero the poet pre&s;ided at tho&s;e
meetings. Another &s;ociety of mu&s;icians, dancers, mimicks, players,
buffoons, and &s;tory|tellers was con&s;tantly convened at the hou&s;e of the
Emperor's &s;econd &s;on Kera Chan, who was given to plea&s;ure and levity. The
Omrahs followed the examples of their &s;uperiors, &s;o that various
&s;ocieties and clubs were formed in every quarter of the city. The Sultan
him&s;elf, having a great pa&s;&s;ion for &s;plendor and magnificence in his
palaces, equipages and liveries, he was imitated by the court. A new city
&s;eemed to lift up its head, and arts to ari&s;e from the bo&s;oms of luxury
and expence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and magnifi|cence,</NOTE>Such was the pomp and
grandeur of the royal pre&s;ence, that none could approach the throne without
terror. The ceremonies of intro|duction <PB N="207" REF="293"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>were conducted with
&s;o much reverence and &s;olemnity, and every thing di&s;po&s;ed &s;o as to
&s;trike awe and a&s;toni&s;hment into the beholders. Nor was Balin le&s;s
magnificent in his cavalcades. His &s;tate elephants were capari&s;oned in
purple and gold. His hor&s;e-guards, con&s;i&s;ting of a thou&s;and noble Turks
in &s;plendid armour, were mounted upon the fine&s;t Per&s;ian &s;teeds, with
bridles of &s;ilver, and &s;addles of rich embroidery. Five hundred cho&s;en
men in rich livery, with their drawn &s;words upon their &s;houlders, ran
pro|claiming his approach, and clearing the way before him. All the Omrahs
followed according to their rank, with their various equi|pages and attendants.
The Monarch, in &s;hort, &s;eldom went out with le&s;s than one hundred
thou&s;and men; which he u&s;ed to &s;ay, was not to gratify any vanity in
him&s;elf, but to exalt him in the eyes of the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His ju&s;tice.</NOTE>The fe&s;tivals of Noro&s;e
and Ide, as al&s;o the anniver&s;ary of his own birth, were held with wonderful
pomp and &s;plendor. But amid&s;t all this glare of royalty, he never forgot
that he was the guar|dian of the laws, and protector of his meane&s;t
&s;ubjects. It was be|fore Balin's time a cu&s;tom in Hindo&s;tan, in ca&s;es
of murder, to &s;atisfy the relations by a certain fine, if they con&s;ented to
accept of it. He aboli&s;hed this cu&s;tom, which has been &s;ince revived, and
ordered the Suba of Budaoon, Malleck Feick, to be put to death upon the
complaint of a poor woman for killing her &s;on.</P>
<P>When Balin was only an Omrah, he gave into the then courtly vices of
wine, women, and play. But upon his acce&s;&s;ion he be|came a great enemy to
all tho&s;e luxuries; prohibiting wine upon the &s;evere&s;t penalties to be
drank in his dominions; laying great re&s;tric|tions upon women of plea&s;ure,
and bani&s;hing all game&s;ters from his court.</P>
<P>So zealous was Balin to &s;upport his authority, that for the
di&s;o|bedience of one man, he would order a force to the remote&s;t parts 
<PB N="208" REF="294"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</NOTE>of the empire to
bring him to puni&s;hment. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;everity to rebels.</NOTE>In ca&s;es of
in&s;urrection or rebellion again&s;t his government, he was not content, as
had formerly been the cu&s;tom, to cha&s;ti&s;e the leaders, but he extended
the capital puni&s;hment of high trea&s;on to the meane&s;t of their
va&s;&s;als and adherents. This &s;everity rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for the
Subas to have the King's mandate for every expedition or ho&s;tilities they
were about to commence.</P>
<P>That his army might be kept in con&s;tant exerci&s;e, he led them
out twice every week to hunt, for forty or fifty miles round the city, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed laws for the pre&s;ervation of the game. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejects the advice of his council to re|duce
Malava.</NOTE>In the year 664, he was advi&s;ed by his council, to undertake an
expedition to reduce the kingdoms of Guzerat and Malava, which had been
an|nexed to the empire by Cuttub ul dien, but were afterwards per|mitted to
&s;hake off the yoke. To this advice the Emperor would by no means con&s;ent,
&s;aying, that the Moguls were become &s;o powerful in the north, having
conquered all the Mu&s;&s;ulmen princes, that he thought it would be much
wi&s;er to &s;ecure what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e invaders, than
to weaken him&s;elf, and leave his country unguarded, by foreign wars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tatar Chan reduced.</NOTE>Mahummud Tatar Chan,
the &s;on of Ar&s;illa Chan, who had be|gun to a&s;&s;ert independence in
Lucknouti, was this year, however, reduced, and obliged to &s;end his u&s;ual
tribute to Delhi. A great rejoicing was made upon this occa&s;ion, at which the
King was pre|&s;ent and gave public audience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mewats extirpated.</NOTE>Balin ordered, in
the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, an army to extirpate a certain tribe of
banditti called Mewats, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of an
exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s about eighty miles &s;outh ea&s;t of the city towards
the hills; from whence they u&s;ed, in former reigns, to make incur&s;ions, to
the number of fifty thou&s;and, even to the gates <PB N="209" REF="295"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1266. Higer. 665.</NOTE>of Delhi. It is
&s;aid, that in this expedition, above one hundred thou&s;and of the&s;e
wretches were put to the &s;word; and the army being &s;upplied with hatchets
and other implements, cleared away the woods for above the circumference of
fifty crores. The cleared &s;pace, afterwards proved excellent lands, and was
well inhabited, as the people were protected by a line of forts along the foot
of the mountains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor quells &s;everal
in&s;urrections.</NOTE>In the 665 year of the Higera, Balin &s;ent an army down
between the Ganges and Jumna, to &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome in&s;urrections in tho&s;e
parts, with orders to puni&s;h the offenders without mercy. The Sultan &s;oon
after marched in per&s;on towards Kattal, Pattiali and Bhogepoor, who&s;e
inhabitants had begun to &s;top all intercour&s;e with Bengal, by the way of
Jionpoor and Benaris. He put &s;ome thou&s;ands of them to death,
e&s;tabli&s;hing ju&s;tice and public &s;ecurity in tho&s;e parts. He ordered
forts to be built, which he garri&s;oned with Pattans, to cru&s;h any future
di&s;turbance, and then returned towards Delhi. Soon after his arrival, he
received intelligence of an in&s;urrection in Budaoon and Kutter, whither he
ha&s;tened with five thou&s;and cho&s;en hor&s;e, and ordered a general
ma&s;&s;acre among the unfortunate in&s;urgents, and &s;ome thou&s;ands of
every age and &s;ex fell by the &s;word.</P>
<P>If &s;uch cruelties can be any where excu&s;ed, it mu&s;t be in a
govern|ment like that of Hindo&s;tan, where rebellions were in tho&s;e days
&s;o common, that, without the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures, the peace and royal
authority could not be at all e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduces Jehud.</NOTE>Balin, after the&s;e
tran&s;actions, marched his army towards the mountains of Jehud, where he
employed them for the &s;pace of two years, in taking &s;orts, and reducing the
wild inhabitants to obedi|ence. This country was famous for breeding hor&s;es,
many thou|&s;ands of which were carried by the Sultan to Delhi. Wherever the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1266. Higer. 665.</NOTE>King marched there
was an order for the Subas, Zemindars, Foge|dars and magi&s;trates of the
provinces to meet him on their own frontiers, with their offerings, which was
afterwards di&s;tributed among the poor. The Sultan, &s;ome time after, made a
journey to Lahore, which city, having greatly &s;uffered from the Moguls, he
ordered to be put in a proper &s;tate of defence and repair; and after having
erected &s;ome public buildings, he returned to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulates the army.</NOTE>About this time, Balin
was told by one of his Omrahs, that a great number of veterans, who had
&s;erved in the preceding reigns, were now become invalids and incapable of
attending their duty. The Sultan, upon this, ordered a li&s;t of their names to
be taken, and &s;ettling half pay upon them for life, di&s;charged them from
fur|ther &s;ervice. The old men however, were di&s;&s;atisfied with this
provi&s;ion, and &s;ome of the principals of them were deputed by the re&s;t,
to go to Malleck ul Omrah, Fuchur ul dien, chief magi&s;trate of Delhi, with
pre&s;ents, to repre&s;ent their ca&s;e to the King.</P>
<P>This venerable magi&s;trate being in great favour with the Sultan,
rejected their pre&s;ents, but told them he would u&s;e his endeavour to get
them continued upon full pay. He accordingly went next day to court, and while
he &s;tood in the pre&s;ence, put on the appearance of &s;orrow, which being
ob&s;erved by the King, he enquired about the cau&s;e of his grief. The old man
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I was ju&s;t thinking that if in the pre&s;ence of
God, all the old men were rejected, what would become of me."</Q> The King was
&s;truck with the reproof, and after &s;ome pen&s;ive &s;ilence, ordered the
veterans to be continued in their u&s;ual pay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shere Chan dies.</NOTE>In the fourth year of the
reign of Balin, Shere Chan Chaja Ta&s;h, who had, from the time of Na&s;ir ul

and other di&s;|tricts, <PB N="211" REF="297">

poi&s;on from the King, but this is not now believed, though reported by &s;ome
malicious people in tho&s;e days. He was e&s;teemed a man of great genius and
an intrepid warrior; having defended his country from the incur&s;ions of the
Moguls, who now became the terror of the Ea&s;t. Sultan Balin, upon the
demi&s;e of Shere Chan, gave Sunnam and Semana to Timur Chan, and the other
countries were divided among other Omrahs of his court. The moguls, encouraged
by the death of Shere Chan, began again their depredations in tho&s;e
provinces. The mutual jealou&s;ies and di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the Subas,
prevented them from doing any thing effectual for the public good.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahummud appointed go|vernor of the
frontiers;</NOTE>The Emperor, therefore, was obliged to appoint his elde&s;t
&s;on Mahummud, at that time bearing the title of Chan Malleck, afterwards
famous by the name of Chan Shehid, viceroy of all tho&s;e frontier provinces.
Mahummud was immediately di&s;|patched to his government with a fine army, and
&s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t generals in the empire. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">an encourager of learning.</NOTE>The Prince
him&s;elf was ble&s;t with a bright and comprehen&s;ive genius, taking great
delight in learning and the company of learned men. He with his own hand, made
a choice collection of the beauties of poetry, &s;e|lected from the mo&s;t
famous in that art. The work con&s;i&s;ted of twenty thou&s;and couplets, and
was e&s;teemed the criterion of ta&s;te. Among the learned men in the Prince's
court, Amir Chu&s;ero and Chaja Ha&s;&s;en bore the fir&s;t rank in genius and
in his e&s;teem. The&s;e, with many more of his philo&s;ophical &s;ociety,
accompanied him on this expedition to Lahore.</P>
<P>Mahummud was vi&s;ited at Lahore by Shech O&s;man Marindi, who was
e&s;teemed the greate&s;t man of that age. But no pre&s;ents or entreaty could
prevail upon him to remain out of his own country; &s;o that after a &s;hort
&s;tay, he returned. We are told, that as he was <PB N="212" REF="298">

of his poems in Arabic before the Prince, all the poets who were pre&s;ent,
were tran&s;ported into a fit of dancing. But the piece affected the Prince, to
all appearance, in a quite con|trary manner; for the tears began to flow fa&s;t
down his cheeks. This might indeed be occa&s;ioned by exce&s;s of plea&s;ure,
though it was, at that time, attributed to that noble emulation which grieves
for that excellence to which it cannot attain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He invites the famous poet Sadi to his
court.</NOTE>The fame of Shech Sadi of Schiraz being great at that time,
Ma|hummud invited him twice to his court; but that renowned &s;age excu&s;ed
him&s;elf upon account of his years, and, with much diffi|culty, was brought to
accept of &s;ome pre&s;ents. Sadi, in return, &s;ent to Mahummud a copy of his
works, and did honour to the abilities of Amir Chu&s;ero the Sultan's
favourite, and pre&s;ident of his learned &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The Prince, every year, made a journey to &s;ee his father at Delhi,
to whom he always behaved with the greate&s;t filial affection and duty. Sultan
Balin gave his younger &s;on Baghera Chan, entitled Na&s;ir ul dien, a Jagier
of Sammana and Sunnam, whither the Prince &s;et out to re&s;ide. His father, at
his departure, advi&s;ed him to re|cruit and di&s;cipline a good army, to watch
the motions of the Mo|guls; and that if he ever &s;hould hear of his giving
him&s;elf up to wine and his former debaucheries, he would certainly withdraw
him from that Suba&s;hip, and never put confidence in him again. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baghera, the Sultan's younger &s;on, reforms his
manners.</NOTE>The Prince took the advice of his father to heart, and entirely
reform|ing his manners, gave great proofs of his natural abilities, though his
mind had taken a wrong bia&s;s in his youth. A place of ren|dezvouz was
appointed, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion from the north, on the river Bea, near

intru&s;ted with the government of Lucknouti, began to appear in arms. In the
year 678, this bold and enterprizing man led an army again&s;t the Rajas
towards Jage|nagur, whom he defeated, carrying off &s;ome hundreds of elephants
and much wealth, out of which he made no acknowledgment to the King. Balin
happened at that time to be very &s;ick, in&s;omuch that the news of his death
was &s;pread abroad. This intelligence having reached the ears of Tughril, he
a&s;&s;umed the red umbrella with all the royal dig|nities, and declared
him&s;elf King of Bengal. Balin hearing of this, wrote him an order to return
immediately to his allegiance, which having produced no effect, he commanded Ab
Tiggi, Suba of Oud, to rai&s;e his forces, and declaring him Suba of Bengal,
&s;ent Timar Chan Shum&s;hi, Malleck Taje ul dien, Jemmal ul dien, and other
generals, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with an army from Delhi, to reduce the

was joined by this force, he cro&s;&s;ed the Sirju, now the Gagra or Deo, and
proceeded towards Lucknouti, whence Tughril advanced with his forces to meet
him. Tughril employed his money &s;o well among the troops of Ab Tiggi, that he
drew ma|ny of the Turki&s;h chiefs over to his party, and then engaging the
imperial army, he gave them a total defeat. The Sultan hearing this news, bit
his own fle&s;h with indignation. He ordered ab Tiggi to be hanged at the gate
of Oud; and di&s;patched Turmutti, a Tur|ki&s;h general, with another army
again&s;t the rebel. Nor was the fate of Turmutti more fortunate than that of

forced marches. But having met with great delay, on account of the roads, and

army, and with all his elephants, trea&s;ure and effects, took the rout of
Jagena|gur<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A town in Ori&s;&s;a, near

determined to execute one of the bolde&s;t enterprizes perhaps ever attempted.
He advanced on full &s;peed, with his forty attendants, whom he fired with the

all rebels. He ordered &s;pits to be erected in the market place, for the
execution of all the pri&s;oners taken in the late expedition; and it was with
the utmo&s;t difficulty, that the Ca&s;ies, Mufties, and learned men, in a body
petitioning their pardon, could obtain it. This venerable body at la&s;t,
&s;oftened the Sultan into mercy, and he drew the pen of forgivene&s;s over
their crimes.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad.</NOTE>WHEN Sultan Balin was numbered
with the dead, Kei Kubad his grand&s;on, in his eighteenth year, a&s;cended the
throne, and a&s;&s;umed the title of Moaz ul dien. He was a prince remarkably
hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, and of an affable and mild di&s;po&s;ition. He had
a talent for literature, and his knowledge that <PB N="223" REF="309"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</NOTE>way was pretty
exten&s;ive. His mother was a beautiful prince&s;s, daughter to Na&s;ir ul dien
Altum&s;h; and if purity of blood royal is of any real worth, Kei Kubad had
that to boa&s;t, for a &s;eries of generations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luxury pre|vails at Delhi.</NOTE>As he had been
bred up with great &s;trictne&s;s under the wings of his father, when he became
ma&s;ter of his own actions he began to give a loo&s;e to plea&s;ure without
re&s;traint. He delighted in love, and in the &s;oft &s;ociety of &s;ilver
bodied dam&s;els with mu&s;ky tre&s;&s;es, &s;pent great part of his time. When
it was publickly known that the King was a man of plea&s;ure, it became
immediately fa&s;hionable at court; and in &s;hort, in a few days, luxury and
vice &s;o prevailed that every &s;hade was filled with ladies of plea&s;ure,
and every &s;treet rung with mu&s;ick and mirth. Even the magi&s;trates were
&s;een drunk in public, and riot was heard in every hou&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad gives him&s;elf up to
plea&s;ure.</NOTE>The Sultan built a palace at Kilogurry upon the banks of the
river Gion, and retired thither to enjoy his plea&s;ures undi&s;turbed;
ad|mitting no company but &s;ingers, players, mu&s;icians and buffoons. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malleck Ni|zam manages public
affairs.</NOTE>Malleck Nizam ul dien, who was nephew and &s;on in law to Fuchir
ul dien, entering into the King's humours, gained great favour, and was
rai&s;ed to the dignity of Vakeel Sultanit, and got the reins of government in
his hands; and Kuaam ul dien Ellaka, who was the greate&s;t man of that age,
was appointed his deputy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affaires to the throne.</NOTE>Malleck Nizam ul
dien, &s;eeing that the king was quite &s;wallowed up in his plea&s;ures, began
to form &s;chemes to clear his own way to the Empire. The fir&s;t object of his
attention was Kei Chu&s;ero, who was now gone to Ghizni, to endeavour to bring
Timur Chan over to his party, in order to recover the throne of Delhi; to which
he claimed a title from his father's right of primogeniture, as well as 
<PB N="224" REF="310"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</NOTE>from the will of the
la&s;t Sultan. But in this &s;cheme Chu&s;ero did not &s;ucceed, and he was
obliged to return from Ghizni in great di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Nizam ul dien endeavoured to make him as obnoxious
as po&s;&s;ible to the King, who was at length prevailed upon to entice
Chu&s;ero to Delhi. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murders Kei Chu&s;ero.</NOTE>Nizam hired
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder the un|fortunate prince on the way, which they
accompli&s;hed at the vilage of Hicke. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His many villainies.</NOTE>The villainies of Nizam
did not &s;top here. He forged a corre&s;pondence between Chaja Chatire the
vizier, and Kei Chu&s;ero, and thus effected that mini&s;ter's di&s;grace and
bani&s;hment. He al&s;o privately a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated all the old &s;ervants
of Sultan Balin, in&s;omuch that a general con&s;ternation was &s;pread through
the city, though none as yet &s;u&s;pected Nizam as the cau&s;e. The more he
&s;ucceeded in his villainies, he became le&s;s &s;ecret in the execution; and
though he began to be dete&s;ted by all ranks, his power and influence was &s;o
great with the King, that he was the terror of every man.</P>
<P>While things were in this &s;ituation, advices arrived of another
inva&s;ion of Moguls into the di&s;tricts of Lahore. Malleck Barbeck beg
Bir&s;e and Chan Jehan were &s;ent with an army again&s;t them. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moguls defeated.</NOTE>The Moguls were
defeated near Lahore, and a number of pri&s;oners brought to Delhi. The next
&s;tep the traitor took, was to in&s;pire the King with jealou&s;y of his Mogul
troops, who, as &s;oldiers of for|tune, had enli&s;ted in great numbers in his
&s;ervice. He pretended that in ca&s;e of a Mogul inva&s;ion, they would
certainly join their countrymen again&s;t him, in&s;inuating at the &s;ame
time, that he be|lieved there was already &s;ome treachery intended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad ma&s;&s;acres the Moguls in his
&s;ervice.</NOTE>The weak prince li&s;tened to tho&s;e villainous intimations,
and, calling their chiefs one day together, he ordered them to be &s;et upon by
his guards and ma&s;&s;acred; confi&s;cating, at the &s;ame time, all their 
<PB N="225" REF="311"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>goods and wealth. He
&s;eized upon all the Omrahs who had any connections with the Moguls, and
&s;ent them pri&s;oners to di&s;tant gar|ri&s;ons in the remote&s;t parts of
the empire. So blind was Kei Kubad to his own ruin, and &s;o infatuated by this
deceitful mini&s;ter, that when any of his father's friends, or well wi&s;hers
to him&s;elf and the &s;tate, made any complaints again&s;t the traitor, he
immediately called for Nizam him&s;elf, and &s;miling, told him, that &s;uch a
per&s;on had been doing him &s;uch and &s;uch ill offices, with an intention to
alien|ate his affections from him. The per&s;on who preferred the com|plaint
became, by this means, a &s;acrifice, while fear prevented others from falling
martyrs to virtue and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mini&s;ter carries all be|fore
him.</NOTE>When Nizam thus carried all before him in the Durbar, his wife was
no le&s;s bu&s;y in the Haram. She had all the ladies at her devo|tion; and, by
way of particular re&s;pect, was called the King's mo|ther. Malleck ul Omrah
Fuchir ul dien Cutwal, who had now reached his ninetieth year, perceived the
de&s;ign of the treacherous mini&s;ter, and called him to his hou&s;e, and by
various arguments, endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s his ambitious &s;chemes, and to
lay the de|formity of &s;uch behaviour fully open to his view. The mini&s;ter
allowed the ju&s;tice of his rea&s;oning, and affirmed that he had no further
intentions than to &s;ecure him&s;elf in the King's favour. That having,
unfortunately, di&s;obliged &s;o many people, it was dangerous for him to
permit his authority to decline.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Baghera Chan the Sultan's father, who had
contented him&s;elf with the kingdom of Bengal, having heard how matters went
on at the court of Delhi, penetrated into the de&s;igns of the mini&s;ter, and
wrote a long letter to his &s;on forewarning him of his danger, and advi&s;ing
him how to proceed. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baghera Chan's advice to his &s;on is
&s;lighted.</NOTE>But his advice, like that of others, was of no weight with
that vicious, luxurious, and infatuated Prince. When Baghera found that his
in&s;tructions were <PB N="226" REF="312"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>&s;lighted, and that
things would &s;oon be brought to a di&s;agreeable i&s;&s;ue, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to|wards Delhi.</NOTE>he collected a great
army and directed his &s;tandards towards Delhi, about two years after the
death of Balin. Sultan Kei Kubad hearing that his father had advanced as far as
Behar, drew out his forces and marched down to meet him, encamping his army
upon the banks of the Gagera. Baghera Chan lay upon the Sirve, and both armies
remained &s;ome days in hourly expectation of an action. The old man finding
his army much inferiour to that of his &s;on, began to de&s;pair of reducing
him by force, and accordingly began to treat of peace.</P>
<P>The young Prince, upon this, became more haughty, and by the advice
of his favourite prepared for battle. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conference proposed be|tween the fa|ther and
&s;on.</NOTE>In the mean time, a letter arrived from his father, wrote in the
mo&s;t tender and affec|tionate terms, begging he might be ble&s;&s;ed with one
&s;ight of him before matters were carried to extremities. This letter awakened
nature which had &s;lumbered &s;o long in Kei Kubad's brea&s;t, and he gave
orders to prepare his retinue, that he might vi&s;it his father. The favourite
attempted all in his power to prevent this interview, but finding the Prince,
for once, ob&s;tinate, he prevailed upon him to in&s;i&s;t, as Emperor of
Delhi, upon the fir&s;t vi&s;it, hoping by this means, to break off the
conference. His de&s;ign, however, did not &s;ucceed, for the old King,
&s;eeing what a head&s;trong boy he had to deal with, con&s;ented to come to
the imperial camp, and ordered the A&s;trologers to determine upon a lucky
hour, and cro&s;&s;ing the river, proceeded towards his &s;on's camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad's in&s;olence.</NOTE>The young Monarch
having prepared every thing for Baghera's reception in the mo&s;t pompous and

accordingly, when he arrived at the fir&s;t door, was ordered to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</NOTE>di&s;mount, and
after he had come in &s;ight of the throne, he was commanded to pay his

crying out, according to cu&s;tom, Baghera Chan to the King of the world
&s;ends health.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mollified up|on &s;eeing his father.</NOTE>The
old man was &s;o much &s;hocked at this indignity, that he bur&s;t out into a
flood of tears; which being ob&s;erved by the &s;on, he could no longer
&s;upport his unnatural in&s;olence, but leaping from the throne, fell on his
face at his father's feet, imploring his forgive|ne&s;s for his offence. The
good old man melted into compa&s;&s;ion, and rai&s;ing him in his arms embraced
him, and hung weeping upon his neck. The &s;cene in &s;hort was &s;o affecting
on both &s;ides, that the whole court began to wipe the tears from their
eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e tran&s;ports being over, the young Sultan helped his father
to mount the throne, and paying him his re&s;pects took his place at his right
hand, ordering a charger full of golden &s;uns to be waved three times over his
father's head, and afterwards to be given among the people. All the Omrahs
al&s;o pre&s;ented to him their Na&s;irs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace &s;et|tled between them.</NOTE>Public
bu&s;ine&s;s being then talked over, every thing was &s;ettled in peace and

intercour&s;e commenced immediately between the two armies, for the &s;pace of
twenty days, in which time the father and &s;on alternately vi&s;ited one
another, and the time was &s;pent in fe&s;ti|vity and mirth. The principal
terms &s;ettled between the two Kings were, that they &s;hould re&s;pectively
retain their former domi|nions; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They return to their re|&s;pective

parted in tears, and returned to their re&s;pective capitals. Baghera Chan was
much affected upon this occa&s;ion, and told his friends at his return to his

<Q REND="inline">"that he had that day parted with his &s;on and the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kei Kubad beginning to reform,</NOTE>When the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1289. Higer. 688.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Different opi|nions con|cerning the origin of the tribe of
Chil|lige.</NOTE>NIZAM UL DIEN AHMUD &s;ays in his hi&s;tory, that the tribe of
Chillige derived their origin from Calidge Chan. Callidge, continues that
writer, having quarrelled with his wife, who was an imperious and vindictive
woman, and fearing &s;he would draw the re&s;entment of her brother Chingez
Chan upon him, de&s;erted his army as he was pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of Ghor
and Ghirgi&s;tan, in his return from the conque&s;t of Iran. Three thou&s;and
of his friends followed Calidge, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
mountains, where they were afterwards joined by many of their countrymen, and
even by &s;ome of the family of Chingez Chan.</P>
<P>Other hi&s;torians, with equal improbability, affirm, that we ought
to look for the origin of the Chilligies, as far back as Eaphs the &s;on of
Noo<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Japhet, the &s;on of Noah.</NOTE>, who,
&s;ay they, had eleven &s;ons, one of whom was called Chillige. But we have
rea&s;on to think that neither of the accounts is authentic, the one being too
modern, and the other too antient, to merit our faith. We hear of this tribe of
Chillige in the reigns of Subuctagi, and Mamood of Ghizni, which entirely
de|&s;troys the former &s;uppo&s;ition; and we have great doubts concerning the
exi&s;tence of Chillige the &s;on of Eaphs, being per&s;uaded that this idle
&s;tory took its ri&s;e from the natural vanity of nations, in tracing
them&s;elves back to remote antiquity.</P>
<P>This tribe however, as we have already ob&s;erved, inhabited the
mountains of Ghor and Ghirgi&s;tan, and were a brave and hardy, though

make a bu&s;ine&s;s of war, and always &s;erved as mercenaries any power that

throne of Delhi, was Egheri&s;h. He was one of tho&s;e &s;oldiers of fortune,
who &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the &s;word; and rai&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ome rank, in the
army of Sultan Balin. His &s;on Firo&s;e being a man of genius, was appointed
to the government of Samana. He was called from thence, as before related, and
u&s;urped the empire. He re&s;erved for &s;ome months, the young Prince
Keiomours, as a cloak to his villainy; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He murders the infant Emperor.</NOTE>and having
e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf upon the throne, he ordered him to be put to death.
He was &s;eventy years of age when he mounted the Mu&s;nud. Firo&s;e, by way of
plainne&s;s, chan|ged the royal umbrella from red to white; laid entirely
a&s;ide his cru|elty, after the death of the young Prince; and became
remarkable for his humanity and benevolence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;ides at Kilogurry.</NOTE>He had no great
confidence in the loyalty of the people of Delhi, and therefore re&s;ided
always at Kilogurry, which he &s;trengthened with works, and adorned with fine

the Sultan's example, built palaces around, &s;o that Kilogurry became known by
the name of the new city.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seeks after popularity.</NOTE>The citizens of

friends and &s;upporters of the new government. The Sultan him&s;elf was at
much pains to cultivate popularity, and for that purpo&s;e he gave great
encouragement to the learned of that age, who, in return, offered the incen&s;e

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nephew of Sultan Ba|lin rebels</NOTE>In the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clemency of the Emperor</NOTE>but, my friends,

<P>This behaviour of the Sultan, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, had &s;oon

confidence might be his be&s;t &s;ecurity. He therefore ordered all his
attendants to unbuckle their armour, and lay their weapons a&s;ide. Malleck

taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ent in chains to Delhi. But Ziffer Chan had
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much as a brave commander in this expedition,
that his fame awa|ked the jealou&s;y of the King. He therefore de&s;igned to
deprive him of his government, but was prevented from this mea&s;ure, by a
great inva&s;ion of Moguls, under Cuttuligh Chaja, the &s;on of Dova Chan, King
of Maverulnere. The army of the invaders con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred
thou&s;and hor&s;e, and they promi&s;ed to them&s;elves the entire conque&s;t

countries beyond the Sind in his march, and protected them from all violence.
He then cro&s;&s;ed the river, and proceeded to Delhi, without oppo&s;ition,
Ziffer Chan retreating with his army before him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They be&s;iege Delhi.</NOTE>The whole country, in
terror of the Moguls, crowded into the city. The crowd became &s;o great, that
the &s;treets were rendered im|pa&s;&s;able, and all bu&s;ine&s;s and

The Sultan po&s;ted him&s;elf in the center, with twelve thou&s;and independant

Rintimpore, after the mutiny at Jallore, having lo&s;t mo&s;t of his men in the

&s;hould he command his wounds to be immediately cured."</Q> The Mogul fiercely
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I would put him to death for a tyrant, and
endeavour to make the &s;on of Amir Deo, to whom my gratitude is due,

behaviour he him&s;elf had been often witne&s;s, he ordered his body to be put
in a coffin, and interred with decent &s;olemnity. The Sultan then commanded
that the Raja's vizier, who had de&s;erted over to him with a &s;trong party

him&s;elf, could not &s;upport them above &s;ix years. He re&s;olved therefore
to reduce the pay, but it occurred to him that this could not be done with

collector received half of the land tax in grain; and the royal agents
&s;upplied the markets at a &s;tated price. To prevent any monopoly in this
article, every farmer was allowed to retain only a certain quantity, according
to the number of his family, and &s;end the overplus, as &s;oon as it was
thre&s;hed out, to market, for which he was obliged to take the &s;tanding
price. The importation of grain was encouraged; but to export it or any other
article of provi&s;ions, was a capital crime. The King him&s;elf had a daily
report laid before him, of the quantity &s;old and remaining in the &s;eve|ral

He at the &s;ame time opened a loan, by which they were enabled to procure
ready money to import cloth from the neighbouring countries, where the poverty
of the people rendered their manufactures cheaper. But what is &s;ome|what
unaccountable, the exportation of the finer kind of manufacture was prohibited,

and to &s;ell them at a certain profit within &s;uch a time, if that price was

were, in this reign, tripled in &s;ome provinces. The pa&s;&s;ing copper money
for &s;ilver, by a public decree. The rai&s;ing 370,000 hor&s;e for the
conque&s;t of Chorra&s;&s;an and Maverulnere; the &s;ending 100,000 hor&s;e
towards the mountains of Himmachil or Kirrigil; the cruel ma&s;&s;acre of many
Mahommedans as well as Hindoos, in different parts of Hindo&s;tan; and many
other le&s;&s;er rea&s;ons, which, for the &s;ake of brevity, we &s;hall
forbear to mention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heavy im|po&s;ts upon the nece&s;&s;a|ries of
life.</NOTE>The impo&s;ts upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, which were levied
with the utmo&s;t rigour, were too great for the power of indu&s;try, and
con|&s;equently the country was involved in di&s;traction and confu&s;ion. The
farmers were forced to fly to the woods, and to maintain them&s;elves by
rapine. The lands being left uncultivated, famine began to de&s;olate whole
provinces, and the &s;ufferings of the people obliterated from their minds
every idea of government, and &s;ubjection to authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Copper mo+ney.</NOTE>The copper money, for want
of proper regulations, was produc|tive of no le&s;s evils than that which we
have already &s;pecified. The King, unfortunately for his people, adopted his
ideas upon currency, from a Chine&s;e cu&s;tom of u&s;ing paper upon the
Emperor's credit, with the royal &s;eal appended, for ready money. Mahummud,
in|&s;tead of paper, &s;truck a copper coin, which being i&s;&s;ued at an
ima|ginary value, he made current by a decree throughout Hindo&s;tan. The mint
was under very bad regulations. Bankers acquired im|men&s;e fortunes by
coinage, whil&s;t the merchants made their pay|ments <PB N="316" REF="402"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1329. Higer. 730.</NOTE>in copper, to the
poor manufacturers, at the &s;ame time that they them&s;elves received for
their exports, &s;ilver and gold. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Villainies in the mint.</NOTE>There was much
villainy al&s;o practi&s;ed in the mint; for a premium to tho&s;e who had the
management of it, the merchants had their coin &s;truck con&s;iderably below
the legal value; and the&s;e abu&s;es were overlooked by the government.</P>
<P>But the great &s;ource of the misfortunes con&s;equent upon this
de|ba&s;ement of the coin, was the known in&s;tability of government. Public
credit could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a &s;tate &s;o liable to revolutions as
Hindo&s;tan; for how could the people in the remote provinces, receive for
money the ba&s;e repre&s;entative of a trea&s;ury that &s;o often changed its
ma&s;ter?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan obliged to call in the copper
mo|ney.</NOTE>From the&s;e evils general murmurs and confu&s;ions aro&s;e
throughout the Empire. The Sultan, to ea&s;e the minds of the people, was
obliged to call in his copper currency. But there had been &s;uch abu&s;es in
the mint, that after the trea&s;ury was emptied, there &s;till remained a heavy
demand. This he was forced to &s;trike off, and thou&s;ands were ruined. The
Emperor him&s;elf was &s;o far from win|ning by this indige&s;ted &s;cheme,
that he lo&s;t all he had in his trea&s;ury; and the bankers accumulated
immen&s;e fortunes, on the ruin of their &s;overeign and the people.</P>

out|rages.</NOTE>Mahummud, by the advice of Amir Noro&s;e, a Mogul chief, who,
with thou&s;ands of his tribe, had entered into the &s;ervice, rai&s;ed a great
army. The Mogul buoyed up the Emperor's mind with the fa|cility of reducing
both Iran and Turan; but before the&s;e mighty pro|jects could be put in
execution, he fell in arrears to his forces. They, finding they could not
&s;ub&s;i&s;t without pay, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves over the empire, and
carried pillage, ruin, and death, to every quarter.</P>

began to build &s;mall forts on the road, to &s;ecure a communication; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's army advance to the fron|tiers of

extremities of famine without knowing how to proceed. At length &s;uch a heavy
rain fell, that the cavalry were up to their bel|lies in water, which obliged
the Chine&s;e to remove their camp to a greater di&s;tance. Chu&s;ero Malleck
then determined to endeavour to make his retreat, but the low country was quite
covered with wa|ter, and the mountains with impervious woods. Their misfortunes
now came to a cri&s;is. Having lo&s;t the road, they found them&s;elves in
&s;uch an unfortunate &s;ituation, that they could find no way out but that by

by his original name Kir&s;ha&s;ib, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a government in the
Decan, called Saghir, began to turn his thoughts upon the empire, and gained
over many of the Omrahs of the Decan to his party. By their influence and the
great riches which he had accumulated, his power became very formidable. He
then attacked &s;ome Omrahs who continued firm in their allegiance, obliging
them to take refuge in the &s;ort of Mindu.</P>
<P>The Sultan having intelligence of the revolt, commanded Chaja Jehan,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan making Deo|gire his capi|tal, calls it

de|termined to make it his capital. But, upon propo&s;ing this affair in his
council, the majority were of opinion, that Ugein was a more proper place for
that purpo&s;e. The King, however, had previou&s;ly formed his re&s;olution. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;troys Delhi.</NOTE>He therefore gave orders
that the city of Delhi, which was then the envy of the world, &s;hould be
rendered de&s;olate, and that men, women, and children, with all their effects
and cattle, &s;hould make a grand migration to Deogire. To add magnificence to
the migration, he commanded trees to be tore up by the roots, and planted in
regular rows along the road, to yield the emigrants a <PB N="320" REF="406">

all who had not money to defray their charges &s;hould be maintained at the
public expence. He ordered that for the future Deogire &s;hould be called
Dowlatabad; rai&s;ed noble build|ings, and dug a deep ditch round the walls,
which he repaired and beautified. Upon the top of the hill upon which the
citadel &s;tood, he formed large re&s;ervoirs for water, and made a beautiful
garden. This change however greatly affected the empire, and di&s;tracted the
minds of the people. But the Sultan's orders were &s;trictly complied with, and
the ancient capital left de&s;olate.</P>
<P>The Sultan having effected this bu&s;ine&s;s, marched his army
again&s;t the fort of Gundana, near Jinner. Nack-naig, who was chief of the
Colies, oppo&s;ed him with great bravery, but was forced to take refuge within
his walls. As the place was built upon the &s;ummit of a &s;teep mountain,
inacce&s;&s;ible but by one narrow pa&s;s cut in the rock, the Sultan had no
hopes of reducing it but by famine. He accordingly ordered it to be blockaded,
and at the &s;ame time, made &s;ome ineffectual attacks, in which he was
repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gundana taken.</NOTE>The garri&s;on becoming

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The viceroy of Moultan revolts.</NOTE>He had not
been long in his capital, when he heard that Malleck Ibah, the viceroy of
Moultan, had rebelled, and was then reducing the country of Punjaab with a
great army. The cau&s;e of the revolt was this: The Sultan having &s;ent an
order to all his Omrahs to &s;end their families to Dowlatabad, the
me&s;&s;enger who was di&s;patched to Moultan, pre&s;uming too much upon the
King's authority, upon ob|&s;erving &s;ome delay, proceeded to impertinent
threats. He one day told Byram Shaw's &s;on in law, that he believed his father
was medi|tating trea&s;on again&s;t the King. High words upon this aro&s;e

his head &s;truck off, by one of Byram Ibah's &s;ervants. Byram Ibah, knowing
the vengeful di&s;po&s;ition of the Sultan, was &s;en&s;ible that this
di&s;re&s;pect to his authority, would never be forgiven, and re&s;olved to
&s;eek refuge in arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is over|thrown and &s;lain.</NOTE>The Sultan
upon the&s;e advices, put his &s;pears in motion, and ha&s;|tened towards
Moultan; and Byram Ibah, with an army numerous as the ants or locu&s;ts,
prepared to di&s;pute the field. Both armies at la&s;t met, and, eager for
victory, engaged with great re&s;olution; but after the du&s;t of the field was
laid with blood on both &s;ides, misfor|tune darkened the &s;tandards of Byram
Ibah, and his troops turning their backs upon glory, abandoned the field. The
Sultan immedi|ately gave orders for a general ma&s;&s;acre of the inhabitants
of Moul|tan; but Shech Rukun ul dien interceded for them, and prevented the
effects of this horrible mandate. Byram Ibah was taken in the pur&s;uit, and
his head brought to the King, who returned towards Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan re&s;ides at Delhi two years.</NOTE>At
&s;ight of their native country and city, all tho&s;e who had been forced to
Dowlatabad, began to de&s;ert the Sultan's army, and to di&s;|per&s;e
them&s;elves in the woods. The Emperor, to prevent the con|&s;equences of this
de&s;ertion, took up his re&s;idence in the city; whi|ther he invited them, and
remained there for the &s;pace of two years. But then he again revolved in his
mind, the &s;cheme of making Dow|latabad his capital. He removed his family,
obliging the Omrahs to do the &s;ame, and carried off the whole city a &s;econd

&s;et fire to their own hou&s;es, and retired to the woods, with their families

ordered a body of troops to ma&s;&s;acre the&s;e unhappy people if they
re&s;i&s;ted, and if they &s;hould be taken, to put out their eyes. Many
populous provinces were, by this inhuman decree, laid wa&s;te, and remained
&s;o for &s;everal years. The colony of Dowlatabad was al&s;o in great
di&s;traction; the people, without hou&s;es, without employment, were reduced

hi&s;tory, of which the following is a horrid in&s;tance. When he remained at
Delhi, he led his army out to hunt, as is cu&s;tomary with princes. When they
arrived in the territory of Birren, he plainly told them, that he came not to
hunt bea&s;ts but men; and without any obvious rea&s;on, began a general
ma&s;&s;acre of the wretched inhabitants. He had even the barbarity to bring
home &s;ome thou&s;ands of their heads, and to hang them over the city walls.
He, upon another occa&s;ion, made an excur&s;ion of the &s;ame nature towards
Kinnoge, and ma&s;&s;acred all the inhabitants of that city, and the adjacent
country for many miles, &s;preading terror and de&s;olation wherever he turned

better, and halted to take medicines for &s;ome days. In this place he gave to
Shahab Sultani, the title of Na&s;erit Chan, and the government of Bidder, with

tributaries to the government of the Carnatic, they &s;eized upon tho&s;e
countries, and drove the Mahommedans before them on all &s;ides. In &s;hort,
within a few months, the Sultan had no po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Decan,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's tyranny, and di&s;tractions in the

misfortunes, grew vengeful, &s;plenitic, and cruel, wreaking his rage upon his
unhappy &s;ubjects, without crime, provocation, or di&s;tinction. This conduct
occa&s;ioned rebellion, robbery, and confu&s;ion, in all parts of the empire.
The famine became daily more and more dreadful, in&s;omuch that the Sultan, not
able to procure provi&s;ions, even for his hou&s;ehold, was obliged to abandon
the city, and to open the gates, and permit the &s;tarved inhabitants, whom he
had before confined, to provide for them&s;elves. Thou&s;ands crowded towards
Bengal, which, as we have before ob&s;erved, had revolted from the Empire. The
Sultan encamped his army near Cumpula, on the banks of the Ganges, and drew
&s;upplies from the countries of Oud and Kurrah. He ordered his people to build
hou&s;es, which at length became a city under the name of Surgdewarie.</P>

Bidder, at one crore of rupees, finding him&s;elf unable to make good that
con|tract, rebelled; but Cuttulich Chan being ordered again&s;t him from
Dowlatabad, expelled him from that government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion at Kilbirgah qua&s;hed.</NOTE>During

friends, rai&s;ed an army with the collections, and in the year 746, erected
his rebellious &s;tandards, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Kilbirgah and
Bidder. The Sultan, on this occa&s;ion, &s;ent a rein|forcement to Cuttulich

Ali Shaw came out and gave him battle; but being defeated, he &s;hut him&s;elf

room of Cuttulich Chan. But Ain ul Muluck him&s;elf looked upon this
appointment as an impolitic &s;tep in the King, con&s;idering the &s;ervices
Cuttulich Chan had done to his affairs in the Decan, and the power he then
enjoyed. And therefore thought it a &s;nare laid to draw him quietly from his
own Suba&s;hip, and then to deprive him of both. In the mean time a number of
the clerks of the revenues being convicted of abu&s;es in their office, were
ordered to be put to death. Some of tho&s;e who &s;urvived found means to

grazing or foraging near the royal camp. The Sultan, in great perplexity,
called the troops of Kole, Birren, Amrohe, Saman, and other di&s;tricts
adjacent, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; while Chaja Jehan joined him, with an army
from Delhi. The Sultan moved his &s;tandards, for Ain ul Muluck and his

great hopes that the Sultan's army, tired and di&s;gu&s;ted with his tyrannical
behaviour, would join them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan engages and overthrows him.</NOTE>The
Sultan, enraged at their pre&s;umption, mounted his hor&s;e, and, engaging
them, after a &s;hort conflict, put them to flight. Ain ul Muluck was taken

&s;wimming acro&s;s, having been wounded in the action, while another brother
was &s;lain in the field. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pardons him.</NOTE>The Sultan was &s;o prejudiced
in favour of Ain ul Muluck, that he pardon|ed him, and re&s;tored him to his
former dignities, &s;aying, that he was certain that Muluck was a loyal

marched from thence to Barage, to pay his devotions at the tomb of Sallar
Mu&s;aood, one of the family of Sultan Mamood Ghiznavi, who had been killed
there by the Hindoos in the year 557. He di&s;tributed great &s;ums among the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cuttulich Chan recalled from the

Decan, accu&s;ing him of oppre&s;&s;ions and other abu&s;es in his government,
though a man of ju&s;tice and integrity. The King re|called Cuttulich Chan to
Delhi, ordering his brother Molana Nizam ul dien, to whom he gave the title of
Alim ul Malleck, and placed at Burudge, to take charge of what remained to the
empire of the Decan, till he &s;hould &s;end &s;ome per&s;on from court. When
the King's or|der arrived, Cuttulich Chan was digging a great pond or
re&s;ervoir, which he begged his brother to compleat, and prepared to return to
Delhi, with all the revenues of the Decan, which he had previou&s;ly &s;ecured
in a fort called Daragire, upon a mountain clo&s;e to the city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan determines to reconquer the
Decan.</NOTE>The Sultan, after the arrival of Cuttulich Chan, appointed four
governors for the Decan, having divided it into four provinces, and determined
to reduce it as before, to his obedience. To accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, he
ordered a numerous army, under the command of Amad ul Malleck, an Omrah of
great reputation, to march to Dow|latabad, and entered into articles with him,
that he and the other chiefs &s;hould pay into the trea&s;ury &s;even crores of
rupees annually for their governments. To make up this &s;um, and to gratify
their own avarice, they plundered and oppre&s;&s;ed that unfortunate country.
At the &s;ame time the Sultan conferred the government of Malava up|on Aziz, a
mean fellow formerly a vintner, and told him, that the Amirs of Sidda<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mogul captains, who entered into his &s;ervice with Amir

regu|lation of all that related to hu&s;bandry, by the name of Amir Kohi, who
divided the country into di&s;tricts of 60 miles &s;quare, under a Shickdar,
who was to be an&s;werable for its cultivation and improve|ment. Above one

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan promotes men of low birth.</NOTE>The

Litchena a &s;inger, Pira a gardener, Mun|ga his &s;on, Shech Baboo a weaver,
Muckbil a &s;lave, and other low fellows, to the degree of Omrahs, and gave
them the command of provinces and high offices at court. He in this, forgot the
advice of the poet, who writes, that

Firo&s;e Shaw having gained over the majority of the Omrahs to his party,
prevailed, with pre&s;ents, upon the Mogul mercenaries to move to &s;ome
di&s;tance from the camp, to prevent di&s;turbances, till he &s;hould reduce
the re&s;t of the army to obedience.</P>

Noro&s;e, an Omrah who commanded a great body of the imperial troops,
de&s;erted that night, and, having joined Altu Chan, the general of the Mogul
mercenaries, told him, that now was the time to plunder the late Emperor's
trea&s;ure, and to retreat to their native country. Altu Chan was ea&s;ily
prevailed upon to adopt this lucrative &s;cheme. They therefore returned next
morning to the camp, which was &s;till in very great confu|&s;ion, and after a
very &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;h, loaded &s;ome camels with trea&s;ure. Firo&s;e Shaw,
to &s;ecure him&s;elf from further depreda|tions, led the army to Sewan, and
took every po&s;&s;ible means to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the avarice of the
mercenaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firo&s;e Shaw mounts the throne.</NOTE>The
Omrahs, the day after this movement, waited upon Firo&s;e Shaw, and intreated
him to mount the throne. After many pre|tended excu&s;es, he favoured the
Omrahs with his con&s;ent, and was accordingly proclaimed Sultan.</P>
<P>He, the very fir&s;t day of his reign, gave orders to ran&s;om many

more than ju&s;tice in him, to acknowledge the title of the young King, and act
as Regent, during the minority. The Sultan immediately convened the Omrahs
before the amba&s;&s;a|dor, and a&s;ked them whether they knew any of the male

advices were received from Guze|rat, that Mahummud Tiggi was defeated by Amud

intercede with the Sultan for his pardon, and to &s;olicit leave to pay his

with his head bare, and his turban hung round his neck, came, accompanied by
&s;ome of the principal men of his party, to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The
King, according to his promi&s;e, gave him his life, but ordered the Cutwal of
Ha&s;&s;en to take him under his care, which was a kind of impri|&s;onment.

<P>The Sultan having penetrated as far as Punduah, one of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firo&s;e Shaw employs him|&s;elf in public

adjoining to that of Delhi; and in the following year marched to Debalpoor,
where he made a canal 100 miles in length, from the Suttuluz to the Jidger. The
King, in the year 757, between the hills of Mendouli and Sirmore, cut a channel
from the Gion or Jumna, which he divi|ded into &s;even &s;treams; one of which
he brought to Ha&s;&s;i, and from thence to Berai&s;en, where he built a

from the Cagar, pa&s;&s;ing by the walls of Sir&s;utti, and joined it to the
rivulet of Kerah, upon which he built a city, named after him, Firo&s;eabad.
This city he watered with another canal from the Gion or Jumna. The&s;e public
works were of prodigious advantage to the adjacent countries, by &s;upplying
them with water for their lands, and with a commodious water-carriage, from
place to place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bengal and the Decan become

the empire, paying only a &s;mall acknowledgment annually, by way of pre&s;ent.
He exacted no other terms of the Decan; &s;o that the&s;e two great members

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ions of the Moguls.</NOTE>The Sultan, being
in the &s;ame year encamped at Semana, received advices that the Moguls had
made an incur&s;ion as far as Debalpoor. He forthwith ordered Malleck Kabool,
with a great army, again&s;t them; but the Moguls, before his arrival, had
laden them&s;elves with &s;poil, and had retreated towards their own
country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan invades
Ben|gal.</NOTE>Notwith&s;tanding of the treaty of 757, the Sultan, in the year
760, re&s;olved upon another expedition into Bengal. Having arrived at
Zifferabad, he cantoned there his army, during the rains. When he lay at this
place, Shech Zadda Bu&s;tami, who had been bani&s;hed, returned emba&s;&s;ador
from the Caliph of Mi&s;&s;er, with a chelat; for which he was graciou&s;ly
received, and dignified with the title of Azim ul Muluck. An emba&s;&s;y having
been, in the mean time, di&s;|patched to A&s;cunder Chan, Sultan of Bengal,
returned with another on his part, and with rich pre&s;ents. The King not being
&s;atisfied with the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, marched, after the rains were over,
towards Lucknouti, and on his way conferred the en&s;igns of royalty upon the
Prince Fatte Chan his &s;on. He gave him ma&s;ters for his in&s;truction, to
whom the royal youth gave great attention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace with Ae&s;cunder, Sultan of

which was al&s;o called Benaris. The Raja, upon the Emperor's approach, fled
towards Tilling. Having plun|dered the country, Firo&s;e Shaw returned, and,
upon his way, was met by the Raja of Beerbhan, who pre&s;ented him with 37
elephants, and other valuable pre&s;ents, upon con&s;ideration of not ravaging
the country. The Sultan having received the pre&s;ents, changed his rout, and,
as he pa&s;&s;ed through the woods of Puddmawitti, which abounded with
elephants, he caught 33 of them, and killed a few in the chace. He then
continued his march, and arrived at Delhi, in the year 762.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for improving the lands of
Sirhind.</NOTE>Firo&s;e Shaw, who had much at heart the improvement of his
country, was informed, that near Hirdar there was a mountain from which there
i&s;&s;ued a great &s;tream of water, which fell into the Suttu|luz; and that
beyond that place there was a &s;mall rivulet called Seli|ma, divided only by a
ri&s;ing ground, from the large &s;tream which we have ju&s;t mentioned. The
Sultan con&s;idered, that by making a cut through this eminence, the great
&s;tream might be carried into the rivulet, and &s;o form a river to water the
countries of Sirhind and Mun&s;urpoor, from whence it might be carried to
Sunnam, and &s;o render great tracts of land fertile. He therefore marched
immediately that way, and ordered fifty thou&s;and labourers to be collected
together to cut the pa&s;&s;age. When the workmen were in this place employed
in digging to great depth, they found &s;ome immen&s;e &s;keletons of
ele|phants in one place, and in another, tho&s;e of a gigantic human form, the
arm bones of which mea&s;ured guzes. Some of the bones were in their natural
&s;tate, and others petrified.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Firo&s;e Shaw reduces Na|gracut.</NOTE>The Sultan
having fini&s;hed this great work, built a fort at Sirhind, which he called
Firo&s;epoor. He from that place marched towards the mountains of Nagracut,
where he was overtaken by a &s;torm of <PB N="344" REF="430">

however reduced the Raja of tho&s;e parts, after &s;u&s;taining &s;ome lo&s;s
on his &s;ide, and confirmed him again in his domi|nions; changing the name of
Nagracut, to that of Mahummud abad, in honour of the former Sultan. Firo&s;e
Shaw was told here, that the Godde&s;s, whom the Hindoos wor&s;hipped in the
temple of Nagracut, was the image of No&s;haba, the wife of the great Secunder,
which that conqueror had left with them. The name of the idol is now changed to
that of Jewallamuckie. In the temple there was al&s;o at that time, a fine
library of the books of the Brahmins, con|&s;i&s;ting of one thou&s;and and
three hundred volumes.</P>
<P>The Sultan ordered one of tho&s;e books, which treated of
philo&s;o|phy, a&s;trology, and divination, to be tran&s;lated into the
Per&s;ian lan|guage, and called it Dellael Firo&s;e Shawi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dellael Firo&s;e Shawi &s;ignifies the arguments of Firo&s;e Shaw.

of No&s;haba, which, &s;ay they, Firo&s;e Shaw &s;ent to Mecca, where it was
buried before the door of the great mo&s;que. It is not improbable, but
Alexander, who penetrated to the Indies, might have left an image of one of the
Grecian Godde&s;&s;es, upon the frontiers of his conque&s;ts. The Brahmins
might have, with le&s;s ab&s;urdity, converted this foreign Godde&s;s into one

hundred elephants, forty lacks of rupees, four hundred Aba&s;&s;inian &s;laves,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tractions in the em|pire.</NOTE>The apparent
debility of the Empire, ari&s;ing from the King's mi|nority and di&s;&s;entions
of the Omrahs, encouraged all the Hindoos around to kindle the flames of
rebellion; particularly tho&s;e of the ea&s;tern provinces. Chaja Jehan, upon
this occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;umed the title of Sultan Shirki<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">King of the Ea&s;t.</NOTE>, and proceeded towards
Behar, with a great army. He &s;oon reduced that country to obedience, and
having at the &s;ame time, forced the Prince of Bengal to pay him the

independency in the We&s;t. Having, as Suba of Debalpoor, collected the troops
of the province of Moultan, and the north-we&s;t divi&s;ion of the empire, he
advanced again&s;t Shicha Gicker, who waited for him at Adjodin, about twelve

Gualier, Mubarick Chan, the &s;on of Malleck Raja, Mullu Eckbal Chan the
brother of Raja Saring Chan, and Malleck Alla ul dien, con&s;pired again&s;t
the life of Sadit Chan. But Sadit having timely information of the plot, &s;lew
Mubarick Chan and Malleck Alla ul dien, while Eckbal e&s;caped to Delhi. Though
the con&s;piracy was thus qua&s;hed, the confu&s;ions which were the
con|&s;equences of it, obliged the Sultan to return to the capital, without
pro&s;ecuting the &s;cheme of reducing tho&s;e territories to obedience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gates of Delhi &s;hut again&s;t

The Sultan arriving in the neighbourhood of Delhi, Muckirrib Chan came out to
pay his re&s;pects. But having on his way under|&s;tood, that Sadit Chan had
&s;worn vengeance again&s;t him, for affording protection to Mullu Eckbal Chan,
he fled back to the city, and &s;hutting the gates again&s;t the Prince,
prepared to make a re&s;olute defence. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes over to the be&s;ieged.</NOTE>The city in

the war was commenced and continued on account of Sadit Chan, accommodated
matters with Muckirrib, and in the month of Mohirrim 797, was admitted into
Delhi.</P>

impo&s;&s;ible for Sadit Chan to keep the field, he &s;truck his tents, and

Under the name of this prince Sadit Chan began to manage the affairs of the
Sultanit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A faction ex|pels Sadit Chan from

di&s;concerted his mea&s;ures. The &s;laves of Firo&s;e Shaw, di&s;gu&s;ted
with his behavi|our towards them, prevailed upon the keepers of the elephants
to join them. They forcibly placed Nu&s;erit Shaw upon an elephant, advanced
again&s;t Sadit Chan, and drove him quite out of the city of Firo&s;e-abad,
before he had time to prepare for his own defence. To avoid one danger, the
unfortunate Sadit fell into another;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The uncom|mon misfor|tunes of the

Nu|&s;erit Chan. Tho&s;e of Delhi, and others, &s;upported the title of
Ma|mood. The whole empire fell into a &s;tate of anarchy, confu&s;ion, and
di&s;traction. A civil war was kindled in every corner, and, a thing unheard of
before, two Kings in arms again&s;t one another, re|&s;ided in one capital.
Things however remained in this unfortunate &s;ituation for three years, with a
&s;urpri&s;ing equality on both &s;ides; for if one monarch's party had at any
time a &s;uperiority over the other, it was in &s;ingularity of misfortunes. It
was not a &s;tate of war, but a continued battle between the two cities:
Thou&s;ands were killed al|mo&s;t every day, and the place of the &s;lain was
con&s;tantly &s;upplied by reinforcements from different parts of the empire.
Some of the Su|bas of the provinces took no part in this civil war. They hoped
to &s;ee the empire &s;o weakened by public calamities, that they them&s;elves
might become independant; and to lay a foundation for their future power, they
withheld the cu&s;tomary revenues.</P>

Moultan, became very powerful, and in the year following, advanced with a great
