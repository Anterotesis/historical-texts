<HEAD>A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF SPAIN, <HI>CONTINUED.</HI></HEAD>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX. CONTINUED</HI> OF MADRID.</HEAD>
<P>THE rich &s;ubjects of Spain, concentrate all their plea&s;ures within the capital. Mu&s;ic and dancing are the two for which the Spaniards have the greate&s;t predilection. They have al&s;o their <HI>Tertulias</HI> and <HI>Refre&s;cos.</HI> The tertulias are a&s;&s;emblies very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of France. Women, in general, &s;eek not many occa&s;ions to a&s;&s;emble; each a&s;pires to be the center of a tertu&s;ia. Women are there admired, and even adored, as well as el&s;ewhere; but when they in&s;pire not a lively &s;entiment, the men &s;eldom pay them tho&s;e attentions which French politene&s;s prodigally be&s;tows on every individual of the fair-&s;ex.
<PB N="4" REF="4">
It is not in the reciprocal communication of tenderne&s;s, that the manners are &s;oftened. On the contrary, it is in the di&s;intere&s;ted a&s;&s;ociation of the two &s;exes, that the nece&s;&s;ity and de&s;ire of plea&s;ing ari&s;es, which forms the charm and cement of &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Refre&s;cos,</HI> the invention of luxury and greedine&s;s, contribute, no le&s;s than the tertulias, to facilitate the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes. In general the&s;e are only &s;light repa&s;ts, prepared for per&s;ons from whom vi&s;its are received, and as a prelude to the tertulias; but on extraordinary occa&s;ions, as a wed|ding, chri&s;tening, or celebrating the birth-day of the head of the family, the refre&s;co becomes an impor|tant, and expen&s;ive affair. All the friends of the fa|mily are invited, and, as they arrive, the men &s;e|parate from the women. The lady of the hou&s;e re|ceives them under a canopy, over which is &s;u&s;pended an image of the virgin. The appearance of the refre&s;co at length enlivens every countenance, con|ver&s;ation becomes more animated, and the &s;exes approach each other. The company are fir&s;t pre|&s;ented with large gla&s;&s;es of water, in which little &s;ugar-loaves are di&s;&s;olved; the&s;e are &s;ucceeded by chocolate, the favourite refre&s;hment, twice a-day of the Spaniards, and believed to be &s;o nouri&s;hing and innocent, as not to be refu&s;ed even to the &s;ick.
<PB N="5" REF="5">
After the chocolate come all &s;orts of confec|tionary.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to conceive the profu&s;ion with which the&s;e delicacies are di&s;tributed. The company is not only cloyed with them, but their hats, their handkerchiefs, and pockets, are loaded with them.</P>
<P>A ball or card-tables commonly &s;ucceed the re|fre&s;co, but the&s;e entertainments are &s;eldom con|cluded with a &s;upper. This is always a frugal re|pa&s;t, with the Spaniards, at which they rarely a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P><HI>Baretti's</HI> account of their a&s;&s;emblies is rather dif|ferent. "It is a cu&s;tom, (&s;ays he) among the Spani&s;h ladies, to &s;end invitations to their friends to come and &s;ee them; &s;ome even &s;everal times a month, others not &s;o often. When a lady intends this, &s;he &s;ends word to her female acquaintance that, on &s;uch an evening &s;he &s;hall have a tertulia. The lady who receives this me&s;&s;age tells the gentlemen of her acquaintance that, on &s;uch an evening, &s;he &s;hall go to the tertulia of &s;uch a lady, which is con|&s;idered as an invitation. To one of the&s;e (&s;ays the above writer) I was invited. On alighting from the carriage, the &s;ervants who rode behind with flam|beaux,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
lighted us up a large &s;tair-ca&s;e, there being no porter at the gate as in England. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e received us at the door of his apartment, and handed the lady that was with us into that where his wife was, with the other ladies who were a&s;|&s;embled. My friend who conducted me, and my|&s;elf, were then introduced into a room full of gentlemen, almo&s;t all dre&s;&s;ed in laced coats.&mdash; Some were &s;itting, others &s;tanding, and either gaz|ing or talking about them, as is u&s;ual in large companies. Pre&s;ently &s;ome &s;ervants, after having been round to the ladies, brought us in &s;ome refre&s;hments. The manner of &s;erving them was &s;ingular. A footman fir&s;t gave each per&s;on a &s;ilver plate; another followed him with &s;ilver &s;alvers, loaded with bi&s;cuits made of &s;ugar, hollow like a &s;punge, and extremely light. Each of us took one, with a gla&s;s of lemonade, upon being dipped into which it in&s;tantly di&s;&s;olved. Chocolate was then di&s;tributed, which being drank, the &s;ervants came round for the cups and &s;ilver plates.</P>
<P>"We then continued a little longer in conver|&s;ation, when behold! the lady of the hou&s;e came out of her apartment, followed by all tho&s;e who were with her. We formed our&s;elves into two rows, one on each &s;ide of them. None of the ladies pa&s;&s;ed by without having &s;omething re&s;pectful or affec|tionate
<PB N="7" REF="7">
&s;aid to them, their an&s;wers to which were in the &s;ame &s;train. At the end of the room where we were was another, into which the ladies entered without any ceremony, whether young or old, mar|ried or unmarried.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as they were entered we followed, and found them all &s;itting on the <HI>e&s;trado,</HI> which is a con|tinued &s;eat, all round the room, clo&s;e to the wall. In a corner of this room was a large table, covered with di&s;hes, filled with various eatables. A large Perigord-pa&s;ty in the middle; a couple of roa&s;ted turkies on the &s;ides of the pa&s;ty; with hams, fowls, game, &s;au&s;ages, &s;allads, <HI>caparonnes,</HI> (a kind of ca|pers, as big as filberts), <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> In &s;hort, this was a cold collation, as plentiful as it was elegant.</P>
<P>"The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of the gue&s;ts, immediately began to carve, whil&s;t the re&s;t of us, &s;natching napkins from a heap, lying on another table, ran and &s;pread them on the ladies' knees, then went back for plates, knives and forks, and then to get &s;uch victuals as we were de|&s;ired to bring; &s;tooping or kneeling by them whil&s;t they were eating, and amu&s;ing them in the be&s;t manner we could; &s;aying whatever came upper|mo&s;t, with &s;uch hilarity and plea&s;antne&s;s that no &s;cene could be more delightful. No &s;ervant was
<PB N="8" REF="8">
permitted to wait at this kind of &s;upper. The la|dies all ate heartily, and the greater part of them drank water.</P>
<P>This merry meal being ended, they went from this room into a much larger, the lady of the hou&s;e preceding as before. They were no &s;ooner gone than we fell on the remnants with a cheerfulne&s;s no where to be met with but in this country. The rule is, to have a concert or cards after &s;upper. About eleven the company begin to &s;teal away, <HI>alla Spag|nola;</HI> that is, without giving the lea&s;t warning of their going, either to the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire that men and women have here of pa&s;&s;ing their time in each other's company is &s;o very eager, that it appears a kind of rage, e&s;pecially to a per&s;on who has lived long in England, where men of all ranks &s;eem a&s;hamed to hang too long about the fair, and where the generality deprive them&s;elves, every day, of their company, during &s;everal hours, merely for the &s;ake of talking politics, or circulating the bottle.</P>
<P>Many are the methods that both &s;exes have con|trived in order to &s;pend as much of their time as po&s;&s;ible together.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"><HI>Baretti</HI> tells us, that every great man's doors are always open, and any of his acquaintance may walk up into his chambers to find him. It is only nece&s;|&s;ary to knock at the chamber door; ladies will re|ceive even their male vi&s;itants in their beds, &s;itting up, bol&s;tered with pillars, and drinking their cho|colate with a &s;mall table before them, the company &s;itting round the bed on &s;tools. When &s;he wi&s;hes to ri&s;e, &s;he de&s;ires them to withdraw, and then receives them again at her toilette. <HI>Baretti</HI> made a vi&s;it of this kind one morning, to <HI>Donna Paula,</HI> a woman of fa&s;hion; and after &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he a&s;ked him to take a ride with her.</P>
<P>One of the &s;ervants out of livery, got into the coach, and on &s;eeming &s;urpri&s;ed, was told in French, &s;uch was the fa&s;hion, and that no <HI>femme comme il faut</HI> ever went alone with a gentleman, not even with her hu&s;band. This privileged &s;ervant bears the title of page. <HI>Donna Paula's</HI> kept as clo&s;e as he could to the corner of the coach, not to ob&s;truct our view through the front gla&s;s, and never failed to cro&s;s him&s;elf, in pa&s;&s;ing by a cro&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon my enquiry if the ladies of Madrid had &s;o far adopted the &s;y&s;tem of &s;ome Italian di&s;tricts, as to have <HI>Cici&s;beos</HI> under the denomination of <HI>Cortejos,</HI> &s;he told me, they had &s;o far improved upon that
<PB N="10" REF="10">
mode, as to divide their male friends into three cla&s;&s;es, called <HI>Anos, E&s;trechos,</HI> and <HI>Santos.</HI> The&s;e names being frequently met with in Spani&s;h writers, it may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome explanation of them.</P>
<P>It is the general cu&s;tom then, for a large circle of acquaintance to meet on the la&s;t day of the year, in the evening, to draw the <HI>Anos.</HI> All the names of the ladies and gentlemen pre&s;ent, whether married or not, are written on &s;lips of paper, and thrown, the gentlemens into one hat, and the ladies into another. The younge&s;t per&s;on in company, then draws a gen|tleman's name with one hand, and a lady's with the other. The two per&s;ons thus drawn, are to be <HI>Anos</HI> during the next twelve months. That is, a lady's <HI>Ano</HI> acquires a kind of right to be oftener in her company, than he would otherwi&s;e have been. He enters her hou&s;e at any hour, dines with her without previous invitation; pays her a regular court|&s;hip, and in &s;hort, becomes in a manner, one of her family.</P>
<P>There is no other difference, continued <HI>Donna Paula,</HI> between the <HI>Anos</HI> and the <HI>E&s;trechos,</HI> but that the <HI>Anos</HI> are cho&s;en on the la&s;t day of the year, and the <HI>E&s;trechos</HI> on the twelfth night. Each <HI>E&s;trecho's</HI> name is al&s;o drawn with a <HI>Copla,</HI> or <HI>Sequedilla,</HI> of
<PB N="11" REF="11">
which there are innumerable, compo&s;ed by our wits for the purpo&s;e, and bought ready printed. <HI>E&s;trecho,</HI> means a clo&s;e friend. As to the <HI>Santos,</HI> they are little different from the <HI>Anos</HI> and <HI>E&s;trechos.</HI> They are likewi&s;e drawn on Chri&s;tmas eve, but in|&s;tead of <HI>Coplas,</HI> or <HI>Sequedillas,</HI> we draw them with the names of &s;aints, from which circum&s;tance, they have their name; to the &s;aint that comes out with the lady's name, the gentleman drawn with her, is to pay particular devotion during that year, and &s;o the lady, to that which is drawn with the gentleman's name.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this cu&s;tom, &s;ays <HI>Donna Paula,</HI> the ladies of Madrid make good wives; nor is there any place in Europe, where hu&s;bands are more gal|lant, fathers more affectionate, and friends more re|&s;pectful. You will &s;ee and hear men and women behave and talk to each other very lovingly, but &s;carce ever find a gentleman <HI>t&eacute;te &aacute; t&eacute;te</HI> with any of us. This is no cu&s;tom of ours. Con&s;ider our me|thod of living. Not only our gates, but every door in our apartments is open from morning to night. All our friends and acquaintances come in and go out without a&s;king leave, and our many &s;ervants are allowed to enter our rooms as freely as our&s;elves, &s;o that tho&s;e ladies who intend to carry on an intrigue, mu&s;t alter the u&s;ual mode of Spani&s;h living, which
<PB N="12" REF="12">
cannot be ea&s;ily done, without incurring cen&s;ure, and making them&s;elves the talk of the town.</P>
<P>During the whole of my re&s;idence in Spain, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I never heard of jealou&s;y in a hu&s;band, nor could I ever learn for certain, that &s;uch a thing ex|i&s;ted; yet in the conduct of many ladies, whether it proceeds from the remains of delicacy, from a &s;en&s;e of propriety, or from fear, caution, circum|&s;pection, and re&s;erve, it is evidently apparent, when their hu&s;bands are in &s;ight. Some have addre&s;s enough to keep the cortejo in concealment; and this in Spain, is attended with no great difficulty, becau&s;e, when the ladies go to ma&s;s, they are &s;o di&s;|gui&s;ed, as not to be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. Their dre&s;s upon that occa&s;ion, is peculiar to the country. They all put on the <HI>ba&s;quina,</HI> or black &s;ilk petticoat, and the <HI>mantilla,</HI> which &s;erves the double purpo&s;e of a cloak and veil, &s;o as completely, if required, to hide the face. Thus di&s;gui&s;ed, they are at liberty to go when they plea&s;e. But &s;hould they be attended by a &s;ervant, he is to be gained, and therefore he be|comes little or no re&s;traint. Be&s;ides this, every part of the hou&s;e is &s;o acce&s;&s;ible by day, and the hu&s;band is &s;o completely nobody at home, &s;o &s;eldom vi&s;ible, and if vi&s;ible, &s;o perfectly a &s;tranger to tho&s;e who vi&s;it in his family, that the lover may ea&s;ily e&s;cape unnoticed.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13">This, however, will not always &s;atisfy the Spani&s;h ladies, who, being quick of &s;en&s;ibility, and remark|able for &s;trong attachment, are mi&s;erable when their cortejo is out of &s;ight. He mu&s;t be pre&s;ent every moment in the day, whether in private or public, in health or &s;ickne&s;s, and mu&s;t be every where in|vited to attend them. There have been recent ex|amples of women of high fa&s;hion, who have &s;hut them&s;elves up for months, during the ab&s;ence of their cortejos; and this not merely from di&s;gu&s;t, but to avoid giving offence to them. If the lady is at home, he is at her &s;ide; when &s;he walks out, &s;he leans upon his arm; when &s;he takes her &s;eat at an a&s;&s;embly, an empty chair is always left for him; and if &s;he joins in the country dances, it is commonly with him. As every lady dances two minuets at a ball, the fir&s;t is with her cortejo, the &s;econd with a &s;tranger; with the former, if &s;he has any vivacity, &s;he makes it vi|&s;ible, and if &s;he can move with grace, it then ap|pears; but with the latter, &s;he &s;hews not only in|difference, but di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;eems to look upon her partner with di&s;dain.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as any lady marries, &s;he is teazed by nu|merous competitors for this di&s;tingui&s;hed favour, till &s;he is fixed in her choice; when the un&s;ucce&s;sful candidates either retire, or &s;ubmit to become in fu|ture, what may be called cortejos of the bra&s;ier, with|out
<PB N="18" REF="14">
any preten&s;ions beyond that of &s;etting round the embers to warm them&s;elves in winter.</P>
<P>It is reckoned di&s;graceful to be fickle; yet innu|merable in&s;tances are &s;een, of ladies who change their lovers often. In this, there is a natural pro|gre&s;s; for it cannot be imagined, that women of &s;u|perior under&s;tanding, early in life di&s;tingui&s;hed for delicacy of &s;entiment, for prudence, and for the elevation of their minds, &s;hould ha&s;tily arrive at the extreme, where pa&s;&s;ion triumphs, and all regard to decency is lo&s;t. As for others, they &s;oon fini&s;h the career. It is, however, humiliating to &s;ee &s;ome who appear to have been de&s;igned by nature, to command reverence, at la&s;t degraded and &s;unk &s;o low in the opinion of the world, as to be never mentioned, but with contempt. The&s;e have changed &s;o often, and have been &s;o unfaithful to every en|gagement, that univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, they end with having no cortejo.</P>
<P>Though jealou&s;y is &s;eldom, if ever, to be di&s;co|vered in a hu&s;band; this cannot be &s;aid in fa|vour of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> connection, becau&s;e both parties are tormented by &s;u&s;picion. This is natural, for as there is no other bond between them, but the pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of mutual affection, each mu&s;t tremble at the approach of any one, who might interrupt their union. Hence they are con&s;tantly engaged in
<PB N="19" REF="15">
watching each others looks, and for want of confi|dence, renounce, in a great mea&s;ure, the charms of &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Even in public, they &s;eem to think them&s;elves alone, ab&s;tracted and ab&s;orbed, attentive only to each other. He mu&s;t not take no|tice of any other lady; and if any gentleman would conver&s;e with her, in a few minutes &s;he appears con|fu&s;ed, and filled with fear of having given offence. In all probability &s;he has, and &s;hould &s;he be the fir&s;t duche&s;s in the kingdom, and he only a &s;ubaltern in the army, &s;he may be treated with per&s;onal indig|nity, and we have heard of one who was dragged by the hair about the room. But if in&s;tead of giving, &s;he &s;hould happen to have taken the offence, even the mo&s;t delicate will fly like a tygre&s;s at his eyes, and beat him in the face till he is black and blue. It &s;ometimes happens, that a lady, weary of her fir&s;t choice, her fancy has fixed on &s;ome new object, and &s;he wi&s;hes to change, but the former, who&s;e vanity is flattered by the connection, is not willing to di&s;|&s;olve it. In lower life, this moment gives occa&s;ion to many of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, which abound in Spain; but in the higher cla&s;&s;es, among whom the dagger is procribed, the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if a man of &s;pirit maintains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the lady dare not di&s;card him, le&s;t an equal combat &s;hould prove fatal to the man of her affections. In this conte&s;t, the hu&s;band is out of &s;ight, and tells for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="16">In a catholic country, with &s;uch depravity of morals, it may naturally be enquired, what be|comes of con&s;cience, and where is di&s;cipline? It is well known, that all are under obligation to con|fe&s;s, at lea&s;t once a year, before they receive the Euchari&s;t. Every one is at liberty to choo&s;e his con|fe&s;&s;or and prie&s;t, but before he leaves the altar, he takes a certificate he has been there, and this he de|livers to the curate of his own pari&s;h, under pain of excommunication, &s;hould he fail to do &s;o. When therefore, a married woman appears, year after year, before her confe&s;&s;or, to acknowledge that &s;he has been, and &s;till continues to be living in adultery, how can he grant ab&s;olution, or how can he be moderate in the penance he enjoins. Without penance, and unle&s;s the prie&s;t is &s;atisfied that there is contrition, with full purpo&s;e of amendment, there can be no ab|&s;olution; without ab&s;olution, no participation of the euchari&s;t, and in the neglect of this, excommunica|tion follows. Yet, from the univer&s;al prevalence of this offence, we may be certain, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome way of evading the rigour of the law. No|thing is more ea&s;y. As for the penance, it is im|po&s;ed by tho&s;e who can have compa&s;&s;ion on the frailties of mankind, and is therefore &s;carcely wor|thy to be mentioned. In many in&s;tances, it is ridi|culous. Were any confe&s;&s;or &s;evere, he would have few at his confe&s;&s;ional. The ab&s;olution is com|monly a more &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s; becau&s;e the penitent
<PB N="21" REF="17">
mu&s;t not only te&s;tify contrition, but give &s;ome token of amendment, by obtaining at lea&s;t for a &s;ea&s;on, from the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, which is the &s;ubject matter of confe&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t ab&s;olution may ea&s;ily be obtained; but when the offender comes year after year with the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion, if he will obtain ab&s;olution, he mu&s;t change his confe&s;|&s;or; and this practice is not only di&s;graceful, but &s;ometimes ineffectual. Here then it is needful to adopt &s;ome new expedient. Two naturally pre&s;ent them&s;elves, for either &s;ome prie&s;t, de&s;titute of prin|ciple, may be found, who, for certain con&s;idera|tions, will furni&s;h billets; or el&s;e, which is a preva|lent practice at Madrid, the common pro&s;titutes con|fe&s;&s;ing and receiving the holy &s;acrament in many churches, and collecting a number of billets, either &s;ell or give them to their friends: and as the&s;e carry neither name nor &s;ignature, they are ea&s;ily tran&s;|ferred.</P>
<P>The principal cortejos in the great cities, are the canons of the cathedrals; but where the military re|&s;ide, they take their choice, and leave the refu&s;e for the church. In the country villages, the monks bear rule, at lea&s;t within their limits, and even in the cities, they &s;et up their preten&s;ions. As for the parochial clergy, one thing is certain, that many of them have families, and all are involved in the com|mon cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="18">This univer&s;al depravity of morals, may be traced to the celibacy of the clergy. It is true, the exam|ple of the court has given a &s;anction to practices, which were before re&s;trained, and made that ho|nourable, which had been attended with di&s;grace: but the effect mu&s;t always, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have been coeval with its cau&s;e. Nay, &s;hould we be in|clined to blame in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the Italians, who are &s;aid to have brought this practice into Spain, we &s;hould be obliged to trace it up to this mi&s;taken principle, that, <HI>conjugal affection is incon&s;i&s;tent with a due di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial functions.</HI></P>
<P>This principle is ab&s;urd, yet upon it is founded the celibacy of the clergy, and from that is nece&s;|&s;arily derived the corruption of their morals. The purpo&s;e of the law is, however, fru&s;trated; for na|ture is like a rapid river, which, checked in its pro|gre&s;s, &s;corns re&s;traint, and when diverted from its proper cour&s;e, either overflows the country, or forms new channels for it&s;elf. What then is gained? The parochial clergy, and the&s;e are the only clergy who &s;hould be &s;uffered in a &s;tate, have their con|nections and their children, but not as they ought, in the mo&s;t honourable way. They are di&s;graced in the eyes of the people, who are taught, by their ex|ample, to live in violation of the laws; and their children, for want of a proper education, are fitted only for the vile&s;t offices in the community. How
<PB N="23" REF="19">
different is the picture, where marriage is allowed. The mini&s;ter is like the father of his pari&s;h, and his wife performs the office of a mother; both &s;et an example of virtue, and in every village, teach the pea&s;ants how to value their dome&s;tic comforts. In the &s;treet, their children, commonly a numerous offspring, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their look of health, by their cleanline&s;s, and by the decency of their conduct; and when &s;ent out into the world, they form the mo&s;t valuable members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The play-hou&s;es in Madrid, are not much fre|quented; the genius of the people does not a&s;&s;imi|late with this &s;ort of amu&s;ement. This will evi|dently appear, by the receipts of two theatres; for taking the average between them in December, they each produced 50 pounds a night, though &s;ome evenings le&s;s than 20 pounds, and even in the Chri&s;tmas week, not more than 16. They have lately introduced the opera, though not with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the genteel peo|ple keep to their own &s;ocieties, except when they attend the balls.</P>
<P>Few people here di&s;cover any love for the &s;ci|ences. Though the cabinet of natural hi&s;tory is open to all the world, it is little frequented: nor are books much read. All who are not engaged in
<PB N="24" REF="20">
bu&s;ine&s;s, are occupied in their attendance on the ladies, with whom nothing of this kind is heard of.</P>
<P>When you pay a vi&s;it to a lady, for wherever there is a lady in a family, the vi&s;it is to her, you neither knock at the door, nor a&s;k any que&s;tions of the por|ter, but go &s;traight forward to the room, where &s;he u&s;ually receives her company, and there you &s;eldom fail to find her, morning, noon, or night; in winter &s;itting near the bra&s;ier, &s;urrounded by her friends, unle&s;s when &s;he is gone out to ma&s;s. The friends are mo&s;tly gentlemen, becau&s;e ladies &s;eldom vi&s;it in a familiar way; and of the gentlemen thus a&s;&s;em|bled, the cortejo is commonly one, though this is not univer&s;ally the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The modes of France have reached Spain as well as many other countries. French cloths and the fa&s;hions and colours approved in France, are worn under the Spani&s;h cloak. The veil is no longer worn, but by women of the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es; for others it &s;erves but to hide the di&s;order of their dre&s;s, when they go out on foot. Except in this ca&s;e, their head|dre&s;s, and whole attire, are carefully adju&s;ted to French fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>Their cookery, &s;uch as they received it from their ance&s;tors, is of a nature to plea&s;e few people.
<PB N="25" REF="21">
They are fond of high &s;ea&s;onings; pepper, pimento, and &s;affron, &s;ea&s;on or colour mo&s;t of their di&s;hes. One of them only, has been introduced among &s;trangers, and the art of the French kitchen has not di&s;dained to adopt it; this is, what in Spain is cal|led <HI>olla-podrida,</HI> a &s;ort of hotch-potch of every kind of meat, cooked together. There is, however, ge|nerally a mixture in the Spani&s;h cookery, participat|ing of the French &s;ort, and in &s;ome, this has wholly &s;upplanted that of Spain.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have phra&s;es of addre&s;s, that would &s;ound odd in all other languages. When a gentleman approaches a lady, he does not tell her that he is her humble &s;ervant, her mo&s;t obedient, as is the u&s;ual mode of addre&s;s in England, France, or Italy, but that he <HI>ki&s;&s;es her feet,</HI> or <HI>lays him&s;elf at her feet,</HI> and when he takes his leave, he entreats her to keep him <HI>at her feet,</HI> or <HI>under her feet: me tenga u&s;ted a &s;us pi&eacute;s,</HI> or <HI>baxo de &s;us pi&eacute;s.</HI> The compliment &s;he re|turns is, <HI>may you live a thou&s;and years,</HI> or, <HI>God go with you, or, the Virgin Mary go with you;</HI> and when &s;he intends re&s;pect, &s;ays, <HI>Be&s;o a u&s;ted las manos,</HI> i. e. <HI>&s;he ki&s;&s;es his hands.</HI> The&s;e civilities may ap|pear a great deal too lofty; but general cu&s;tom takes off much from the literal meaning of complimen|tary words in all countries.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions in this town are not &s;o dear as might
<PB N="26" REF="22">
be expected, con&s;idering its populou&s;ne&s;s, and its being &s;ituated in a province naturally barren. A poor family, of &s;ix or &s;even people, may be &s;upplied with bread, meat and wine, for as many reals. The common fare of the lower cla&s;s is fre&s;h mutton, and &s;alted pork, boiled with French-beans, chick-peas, onions, and pot-herbs. On meagre days they live on &s;tock-fi&s;h and pilchards, dre&s;&s;ed in various man|ners, but always &s;o much &s;piced that it is not ea&s;y for &s;trangers to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;uch a burning di&s;h. The poore&s;t cla&s;s of all live almo&s;t entirely on the di&s;tribution of victuals which many convents make here every day throughout the year. Here the beggar makes &s;ure of a loaf and a me&s;s of broth, enriched often with a &s;lice of meat.</P>
<P>With regard to the tables of the rich, they are as &s;umptuous as in any country whatever. A grandee of the fir&s;t cla&s;s will frequently &s;pend one half of his income for the maintenance of his table. The &s;ingle article of fi&s;h has been known to &s;tand &s;ome noblemen in full &pound;2000 a-year.</P>
<P>The two deare&s;t articles in Madrid are wood and charcoal. A hundred pounds weight of each co&s;ts near a crown. This is the rea&s;on, perhaps, that there are &s;o few chimnies to be &s;een in Madrid. The poor &s;tand ba&s;king in the &s;un in winter, wrapped

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the E&s;curial, Aranjuez, Ildefon&s;o, and other Pa|laces, together with the Court.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING taken a very di&s;tinct view of the build|ings, manners, and cu&s;toms of the capital, we &s;hall proceed to the royal palaces in the environs; and, in treating of them will give &s;ome account of the court.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e, the E&s;curial claims our fir&s;t no|tice. The whole building con&s;i&s;ts of a palace, a church, a convent, and a burial-place for the &s;ove|reigns of Spain. The etymology of the word <HI>E&s;cu|rial,</HI> is a place full of rocks, and the nature of the country agrees perfectly with it. This famous mo|na&s;tery is &s;eated in a deep rece&s;s, at the foot of
<PB N="28" REF="24">
tho&s;e high mountains &s;eparating the two Ca&s;tilles; and protected from every wind, except the &s;outh|ea&s;t; it looks down upon a wide extended plain, with all the neighbouring hills, covered by thick woods; whil&s;t the mountains, to the north, are bare, or covered almo&s;t perpetually with &s;now.</P>
<P>It was built by <HI>Philip</HI> II. in obedience to his fa|ther <HI>Charles</HI> V. to accompli&s;h his vow, made after the battle of St. Quintin, which he gained by the interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>St. Lorenzo.</HI> In honour of that &s;aint the architect, <HI>Juan de Bauti&s;ta de Toledo,</HI> took his idea from a gridiron, the in&s;trument on which he &s;uffered, making the royal re&s;idence pro|ject, by way of handle, and repre&s;enting not only the bars by multiplied divi&s;ions, but the legs by four high towers, placed in the angles of this edifice.</P>
<P>In Spain the building goes by the name of this &s;aint. The choice which <HI>Philip</HI> V. made of this &s;teep &s;ituation, indicates the &s;avage and melancholy character which hi&s;tory gives to that prince. This building is quadrangular, with the principal front to the we&s;t, behind which is a mountain; the oppo&s;ite front, facing Madrid, takes the form of the &s;horten|ed handle of a gridiron rever&s;ed. It is an amazing &s;tructure, and has the appearance of a town. In the whole it certainly has &s;omething awful, but
<PB N="29" REF="25">
does not perfectly corre&s;pond with the idea formed of it, according to the accounts received. Its form does not permit the architect to make the mo&s;t of its va&s;t extent, and it is not till we have pa&s;&s;ed the numerous dormitories, and wandered among the courts, &s;tair-ca&s;es, and galleries, that the imagination completes what, at fir&s;t view, was only &s;ketched.</P>
<P>In the architecture there is nothing magnificent. It has rather the &s;erious &s;implicity of a convent, than the &s;plendid elegance of a palace. The front, to the we&s;t, has a fine portal, formed by large co|lumns, of the Doric order; and on each &s;ide two great doors of noble dimen&s;ions. By this portal we pa&s;s to an elegant &s;quare court, at the bottom of which is a church. This principal entrance is ne|ver open, even for the kings of Spain and the princes of the blood, but on two &s;olemn occa&s;ions. When they come the fir&s;t time to the E&s;curial, and when their remains are depo&s;ited in the vault which awaits them. "I could not but imagine (&s;ays <HI>Bour|goann&egrave;</HI>) on viewing this entrance, but that I perceiv|ed the emblems of the gates of life and tho&s;e of eternity, which, for the children of kings, as well as for the re&s;t of mortals, open but once, and imme|diately &s;hut again for ever."</P>
<P>The front, to the &s;outh, is entirely de&s;titute of or|nament,
<PB N="30" REF="26">
but in the four &s;tories there are nearly 300 windows. The whole edifice is built with hewn &s;tone, of a &s;pecies of ba&s;tard granite; which, being become brown with time, adds to the au&s;terity of the building. The quarry where it was dug, in the neighbourhood of the E&s;curial, is &s;aid to have been one motive for the choice of its &s;ituation. It fur|ni&s;hed blocks of &s;uch con&s;iderable dimen&s;ion, that three &s;tones were &s;ufficient to form the chambranle of the greate&s;t doorways, and each &s;tep of the prin|cipal &s;tair-ca&s;e is compo&s;ed but of one.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ight of the E&s;curial, it conveys the idea of a &s;quare quarry of &s;tone, above ground; for it is indeed the large&s;t, though not the mo&s;t elegant building in Europe. The dimen&s;ions are 657 feet in breadth, and the &s;ides 494 feet in depth. <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> from whom we have made this extract, &s;ays he mea&s;ured it him&s;elf. The height is 70 feet.</P>
<P>The chief front has 35 windows in breadth. It is &s;aid there are 4000 windows, and 8000 doors in the building; 1110 of the&s;e windows are on the out&s;ide of the four fronts.</P>
<P>When the court is not at the E&s;curial, it is but a va&s;t convent, inhabited by 200 monks, under the in&s;pection of a prior. At the arrival of the court the convent is transformed into a palace. The monks
<PB N="31" REF="27">
are bani&s;hed to the &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides, and the principal cells become the habitation of the royal family, and the nobility and gentry by whom it is accompanied. The king him&s;elf has his in the narrow &s;pace which forms the handle of the grid|iron. <HI>Philip</HI> II. &s;eems to have wi&s;hed to make this a retreat where &s;overeign greatne&s;s might retire to hide it&s;elf beneath the &s;hade of the altars, and become familiari&s;ed to its tomb; and its &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, faithful to this vow of humility, &s;till content them|&s;elves with the &s;ame mode&s;t habitation.</P>
<P>To connoi&s;&s;eurs in painting no place can afford higher entertainment than the convent of the E&s;cu|rial. In every part are &s;een works of the be&s;t ma&s;|ters, and even &s;ome of their mo&s;t capital perform|ances. It were endle&s;s to enumerate particulars. Suffice it to &s;ay, that during the re&s;idence of a month I never failed a &s;ingle day vi&s;iting the con|vent, and never left it without regret. I had pecu|liar plea&s;ure in finding here &s;o many monuments of <HI>Titian,</HI> and a Holy Family by <HI>Raphael;</HI> the latter once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our <HI>Charles</HI> I. but &s;old by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and purcha&s;ed by the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador for &pound;2000.</P>
<P>The &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, and medallions of the E&s;curi|al, are not in any great number, nor very remarkable for their excellence. <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> in the church, is
<PB N="32" REF="28">
good and &s;imple. Many have taken it for an an|tique; but the only part likely to be &s;o is the head, and that is &s;u&s;pected to have belonged to a <HI>Bac|chus.</HI></P>
<P>Never was an in&s;trument of martyrdom &s;o multi|plied, &s;o honoured, and &s;o celebrated, as the grid|iron. They are to be met with in every part of this building; there are &s;culptured gridirons, painted gridirons, iron gridirons, marble gridirons, wooden gridirons, and &s;tucco gridirons; there are gridirons over the doors, in the yards, in the windows, and in the galleries.</P>
<P>The E&s;curial, as a re&s;idence, is far from plea|&s;ant. Were it low and &s;heltered, like Aranjuez, it would be agreeable in &s;pring; or, were it elevated, hanging to the north, and covered by thick woods, like S. Ildefon&s;o, it might be delightful as a retreat in &s;ummer; but, expo&s;ed as it is to the full power of the meridian &s;un, and rai&s;ed up nearly to regions covered with eternal &s;now, without &s;helter, and de&s;titute of &s;hade, it has no local charms at any &s;ea|&s;on of the year. The mini&s;ters, foreign and dome&s;|tic, give good dinners, and do every thing to make this &s;olitude &s;upportable; but, as few ladies can be accommodated here, the a&s;&s;emblies want that gaiety which is peculiar to the &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="29">The pantheon, or catacomb, where the royal fa|mily, beginning with <HI>Charles</HI> V. are buried, is a &s;ub|terranean vault, of beautiful marble, highly fini&s;hed, capable of receiving 26 bodies, each in its own re|ce&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel a kind of religious awe when we de&s;cend into this vault, in which de|cea&s;ed grandeur &s;eems to &s;truggle again&s;t annihi|lation. A few rays of half-extingui&s;hed light, with difficulty penetrate this cold abode. To &s;up|ply the defect, a &s;uperb lu&s;tre, pendant from the cupola, is lighted up on extraordinary occa&s;ions; but, except in the&s;e ca&s;es, the curious are conducted by a flambeau, into the middle of this motionle&s;s and &s;ilent a&s;&s;embly of &s;overeigns of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>By the un&s;teady light of the flambeau we di&s;cover, oppo&s;ite the door by which we enter, an altar and a crucifix of black marble, upon a pede&s;tal of por|phyry. The re&s;t corre&s;ponds to this melancholy magnificence. The ca&s;es which contain the bodies of the kings and queens are placed on each &s;ide of the altar. The pantheon is not yet full, but the empty ca&s;es are open, ready to receive their depo|&s;its. A &s;alutary, yet terrible le&s;&s;on, which kings have not refu&s;ed to receive, from the bold de&s;igns of an able architect.</P>
<P>The ravages of time, &s;econded by the damps, have not &s;pared even the marble. Here we are at
<PB N="34" REF="30">
once led to reflect on the frailty of man, whatever may be his rank, and the peri&s;hable nature of his works, which in his pride he dares con&s;ecrate to immortality.</P>
<P>The Friars of this convent, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> are 160, and their annual revenue is 5,000,000 of reals, or about 50,000 pounds, ari&s;ing partly from land, and partly from their flock of 36,000 Marino &s;heep, be|&s;ides 1000 kept con&s;tantly near home for the con|&s;umption of the family.</P>
<P>Their library con&s;i&s;ts of 30,000 volumes, con|tained in two magnificent apartments, each about 182 Engli&s;h feet in length. In the lower room are chiefly printed books; yet, in it is depo&s;ited the fa|mous manu&s;cript of the Four Go&s;pels, written in gold letters, a work of the eleventh century. Over the&s;e are collected 4300 manu&s;cripts, of which 567 are Greek, 67 Hebrew, and 1800 Arabic, the latter well de&s;cribed in a catalogue lately publi&s;hed by <HI>Ca&s;iri.</HI></P>
<P>The library is open every morning and evening, during the re&s;idence of the court. If, &s;ays <HI>Bour|goanne,</HI> you have brought with you to the E&s;curial, prejudices again&s;t the Spaniards in general, or again&s;t the Monks in particular, you will certainly lay them a&s;ide after having pa&s;&s;ed a quarter of an
<PB N="35" REF="31">
hour with the Jeronymites of this mona&s;tery; you will be convinced that, under the Spani&s;h mantle, or even the religious habit, more obliging manners, more complai&s;ance, and more real goodne&s;s are con|cealed, than are promi&s;ed by the elegance of a French dre&s;s. For the truth of what I here &s;ay, I may appeal to two Dani&s;h profe&s;&s;ors, who, a few years ago, were &s;ent to the E&s;curial to make learned re&s;earches, and were, perhaps, better received by the Monks, notwith&s;tanding the difference of man|ners, language, and religion, than they would have been at the Univer&s;ity of Copenhagen. They were lodged in the convent, and provided with every thing they could wi&s;h, with the mo&s;t generous ho&s;|pitality.</P>
<P>All the trea&s;ures of the library were open to them, and they pa&s;&s;ed two months in examining and mak|ing extracts from the manu&s;cripts which excited their curio&s;ity. They returned home with hearts deeply impre&s;&s;ed with gratitude, and Port-folios enriched with the fruits of their laborious re&s;earches.</P>
<P>The obliging genero&s;ity they experienced on this occa&s;ion, was the more remarkable, as the manu|&s;cripts, entru&s;ted to their in&s;pection, are &s;till un|known to the public, except by a few extracts only, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> given of them by a learned Monk, named <HI>Ca&s;&s;iri.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="32">The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of two volumes, in folio, but are far from completing the exten&s;ive plan propo&s;ed by the Monk. After his death, they were con&s;igned to another of the fathers of the E&s;curial, and the learned impatiently expect the re&s;ult of his labours.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of St. Ildefon&s;o, upon the declivity of the mountains, &s;eparating the two Ca&s;tiles, and fronting a va&s;t plain, where there is no ob&s;tacle to the pa&s;&s;age of the North wind, renders this abode delightful in &s;ummer. The mornings and evenings of the hotte&s;t days, are agreeably cool. Yet, as this palace is upwards of 20 leagues from Madrid, and half of the road leading to it cro&s;&s;es the broad tops of mountains, extremely &s;teep in many places, it is much more agreeable to the lovers of the chace, and &s;olitude, than to others. The court of Spain comes here annually, during the heat of the dog days. It arrives about the end of July, and returns at the beginning of October.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnificent in the palace, par|ticularly in its exterior appearance. The front, on the &s;ide of the garden, is of the Corinthian order, and not de&s;titute of elegance. It is two &s;tories high, contains 31 windows in view, and 12 rooms in a &s;uite. In the middle is the church. The gardens are on a &s;lope, on the top of which is the great re|&s;ervoir of water, called here, <HI>el mar,</HI> i. e. the &s;ea;
<PB N="37" REF="33">
which &s;upplies the fountains: this re&s;ervoir is fur|ni&s;hed from the torrents which pour down the mountains. The great entry is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that of Ver&s;ailles, and with a large iron palli&s;ade. In the gardens are 27 fountains; the ba&s;ons are of white marble, and the &s;tatues, which are all excel|lent, and equal to any of the kind even in Italy, are of lead, bronzed and gilt. Here are two noble ca&s;cades, of ten falls each. The&s;e gardens are al&s;o ornamented with 61 very fine marble &s;tatues, as large as life, with 28 marble va&s;es, and 20 leaden va&s;es gilt. For the diver&s;ions of the younger branches of the royal family, there is a mall of 580 paces in length. Near which is a large labyrinth. The gardens were laid out by a Frenchman, named <HI>Bouteleux.</HI> The fountain of fame, which is the lowe&s;t in &s;ituation, &s;pouts water to the height of 133 feet, which is exactly that of the weather-cock, on the top of the church &s;teeple.</P>
<P>The upper part of the palace contains many va|luable paintings, and the lower part antique &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, and bas-reliefs. All the rooms have their ceilings painted in fre&s;co, and decorated with large looking-gla&s;&s;es, made here. The floors are all of chequered marble, and the tables of the fine&s;t Spa|ni&s;h marbles, of various &s;orts. The windows, which reach from the ceiling to the floor, con&s;i&s;t of large plates of gla&s;s, &s;et in lead, gilt.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="34">It is &s;ingular that the ca&s;tle, and magnificent gardens of St. Ildefon&s;o, &s;hould have co&s;t about 45,000,000 of pia&s;tres, or near 6,500,000 &s;terling, preci&s;ely the &s;um in which <HI>Philip</HI> died indebted. This enormous expence will appear credible, when it is known that the &s;ituation of the royal palace was, at the beginning of this century, the &s;loping top of a pile of rocks; that it was nece&s;&s;ary to dig, and hew out the &s;tones, and, in &s;everal places, to level the rocks; to cut out of its &s;ides, a pa&s;&s;age for a hundred different canals, to carry vegetative earth to every place in which it was intended to &s;ub&s;titute cultivation for &s;terility, and to work a mine to clear a pa&s;&s;age to the roots of the numerous trees, which are there planted. All the&s;e efforts were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. In the orchards, kitchen gardens, and pa&s;tures, there are but few flowers, e&s;paliers or plants, which do not thrive; but the trees, naturally of a lofty growth, and, which, con&s;equently mu&s;t &s;trike their roots deep in the earth, already prove the in&s;ufficiency of art, when attempting to &s;truggle again&s;t nature. Many of them langui&s;h with with|ered trunks, and with difficulty keep life in their almo&s;t naked branches. Every year it is nece&s;&s;ary to call in the aid of gun-powder, to make new beds for tho&s;e which are to &s;upply their place; and none of them are covered with that tufted foliage which belongs only to tho&s;e that grow in a natural &s;oil. In a word, there are, in the groves of St. Ildefon&s;o,
<PB N="39" REF="35">
marble &s;tatues, ba&s;ons, ca&s;cades, limpid waters, ver|dure, and delightful pro&s;pects; in &s;hort, every thing but that which would be more charming than all the re&s;t, thick &s;hades.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league from this royal man&s;ion, runs a little river, (the Ere&s;ma,) made for the innocent plea&s;ures of the &s;overeign. The banks have on each &s;ide a cau&s;eway, or when the ground requires them, there are &s;tone, or &s;od &s;teps. It is enclo&s;ed between two piles of rocks, grouped in the mo&s;t romantic manner. Its limpid waters &s;ometimes run tumultuou&s;ly over le&s;&s;er rocks in the bed of the river, or precipitate them&s;elves by natural ca&s;cades, &s;ometimes form &s;mall ba&s;ons, &s;erv|ing as a&s;ylums to the trout, where the king occa|&s;ionally fi&s;hes. Readers, if ever you &s;hould re&s;ide for &s;ome time at St. Ildefon&s;o, and find your&s;elf wearied with the dull magnificence, on the bank of this river is one of the fine&s;t Engli&s;h gardens nature ever formed.</P>
<P>The court of Spain goes once a year to alarm the Naiades of this &s;tream, by the noi&s;e of a general deer-hunting. The rendezvous is on the banks of this little river, about a league from St. Ildefon&s;o. Some days previous to the arrival of the court, a number of pea&s;ants are &s;ent to the neighbouring woods and hills, to drive before them the deer, with
<PB N="40" REF="36">
which the country plentifully abounds. The pre|&s;cribed limits are by degrees narrowed, until the time fixed for rou&s;ing the game. The &s;port then becomes excellent; the deer run in &s;mall herds on every &s;ide, &s;eemingly perceiving the danger into which they are driven; after which, they face about, and endeavour to brave the running fire of the mu&s;|quetry, threatening them in the rear; but, obeying the impul&s;es of fear, and failing in the attempt, they pa&s;s in clo&s;er herds through the fatal defile, where the King and Royal family, placed in ambu&s;cade, wait their arrival. Their agility now becomes their la&s;t re&s;ource, and &s;aves the greater number. Out of 3 or 4000, and &s;ometimes more, which thus pa&s;s in review, about 100 fall. Some remain dead on the &s;pot; others carry away with them the mortal wound, and fly, to conceal their agony, in the thickets. Their bodies, whil&s;t yet in palpitation, are brought, and arranged upon the field of battle. The&s;e are numbered with a cruel &s;atisfaction, for which a philo&s;opher would reproach him&s;elf, but which it is agreed to pardon in hunters. The whole court, the Amba&s;&s;adors, and foreign mini&s;ters, commonly take part in this amu&s;ement, which is repeated towards the end of every vi&s;it to the E&s;|curial.</P>
<P>The gla&s;s manufacture is here carried to a degree of perfection, unknown in England. The large&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="37">
mirrors are made in a bra&s;s frame, 162 inches long, 93 wide, and &s;ix deep, weighing near nine tons. The&s;e are de&s;igned wholly for the royal palaces, and for pre&s;ents from the King. Yet, made for &s;uch purpo&s;es only, it proves a devouring mon&s;ter in a country where provi&s;ions are dear, fuel &s;carce, and carriage exceedingly expen&s;ive. About 280 men are employed. The King is &s;aid to make no great profit by it; however, it is a very material point to be able to &s;upply his &s;ubjects with a good commo|dity, and to keep in the country a large &s;um of money that formerly went out annually, to purcha&s;e it from &s;trangers. To provide fuel for the fires they have put the pine-woods under proper regulations, and &s;tated falls: 27 mule loads of fir-wood, are con|&s;umed every day; and four loads co&s;t the King, in|cluding all the expences of cutting and bringing down from the mountains about 40 reals.</P>
<P>The palace of Aranjuez, is 27 miles from Ma|drid. The road to it is one of the fine&s;t in Europe. It cro&s;&s;es the famous bridge of Toledo, built by <HI>Philip</HI> II. and which, it has been &s;aid, only wanted a river. When the Manzanares is very low, which is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e, this little river is ford|able, and the bridge avoided, which cuts off a quarter of a league in cro&s;&s;ing the fine part of the environs of Madrid, called <HI>Las delicias,</HI> a walk con|&s;i&s;ting of two divergent allies, which terminate at
<PB N="42" REF="38">
the canal of Manzanares. On the other &s;ide begins the fine road to Aranjuez. After having travelled &s;ix leagues on a level road, &s;urrounded with olive trees, we de&s;cend by a &s;piral declivity to the charm|ing valley of Aranjuez.</P>
<P>On arriving in this valley, the dry and naked plains of Ca&s;tille di&s;appear, and are &s;ucceeded by a richer &s;oil when we travel in the &s;hade, &s;urrounded by ca&s;cades, and the murmurs of rivulets. The meadows are enamelled with flowers, and the pa&s;|tures di&s;play the mo&s;t lively and variegated colours. Vegetation appears in all its richne&s;s, and proclaims a neighbouring river, which, with its beneficent waters, fertilizes and vivifies the land&s;cape. The Tagus, entering the valley at the Ea&s;t end, runs and meanders for two leagues; and, after having re|flected the images of the mo&s;t beautiful plantations, joins the Xamara.</P>
<P>The learned find, in this junction, the etymology of the name of Aranjuez. They tell us, the ancients erected temples at the confluence of rivers, that there was one in honour of <HI>Jupiter</HI> at that of the Tagus and Xarama; and, that thence is derived the name of <HI>Aram Jovis,</HI> 'altar of Jupiter,' whence by corruption Aranjuez. Ancient however as may be the name, the embelli&s;hments are modern.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="39">The fir&s;t Spani&s;h monarch who re&s;ided there for any con&s;iderable length of time, was <HI>Charles</HI> V. He began to build the palace his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have in|habited, and to which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> VI. and <HI>Charles</HI> III. have each added a wing. In this new form it is &s;till le&s;s a royal man&s;ion, than a very agreeable country hou&s;e, mo&s;t delightfully &s;ituated, where art has done nothing more than make an advantageous u&s;e of the advances of nature. The Tagus, which runs in a right line to the Ea&s;tern front, glides by the pa&s;|ture, and forms, almo&s;t under the windows, an ar|tificial ca&s;cade.</P>
<P>A &s;mall arm of the river e&s;capes from the ca&s;|cade, and &s;o clo&s;ely wa&s;hes the walls of the palace, that, from his terrace, the monarch may take the diver&s;ion of fi&s;hing. This arm afterwards rejoins the river, and thus forms a plea&s;ant i&s;land; which is a va&s;t garden of an irregular form, where &s;hade, and fre&s;h air, and the warbling of birds, are con|&s;tantly found.</P>
<P>Art &s;eems to have left to nature the care of em|belli&s;hing Aranjuez. The palaces, and other edi|fices, are of a plea&s;ing form, but without magnifi|cence. The furniture of the apartments is le&s;s rich than elegant. The paintings are not numerous; there are only &s;ome portraits of the princes of the hou&s;es of Bourbon and Braganza; and a few Nea|politan
<PB N="44" REF="40">
paintings, in which nature &s;eems imitated with more truth than elegance.</P>
<P>It would require too much time to conduct the reader through all the fine plantations of Aranjuez; from the village of which, runs a covered portico, continued to the buildings adjoining to the palace.</P>
<P>Near Aranjuez are &s;tables of breeding mares, be|longing to the King of Spain, in which the breed of Spani&s;h hor&s;es is &s;till pre&s;erved in all its ancient beauty. The building, has for in&s;cription, <HI>vento gravidas ex prole putaris;</HI> i. e. <HI>From their &s;wiftne&s;s you would imagine them engendered by the winds.</HI> The&s;e animals more e&s;pecially contribute to the em|belli&s;hment of Aranjuez. They there peculiarly di&s;play all the beauty of their motions, and their &s;peed.</P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Calle de la reyna</HI> was the cour&s;e where hor&s;es from Barbary di&s;played their &s;wiftne&s;s. A new kind of amu&s;ement is now &s;ub&s;tituted there, called the <HI>Parejas,</HI> which I had the &s;atisfaction of viewing, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> previous to my departure from Aranjuez. The Prince of A&s;turias, with his two brothers, attended by 45 of the fir&s;t nobility, all in the ancient Spani&s;h dre&s;s, and mounted on high-bred Andalu&s;ian hor&s;es, performed a variety of evolutions to the &s;ound of trumpets, and French-horns,
<PB N="45" REF="41">
forming four &s;quadrons, di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the colour of their dre&s;&s;es, which were red, blue, yellow, and green. They executed this figure-dance with great exactne&s;s, and made an elegant appearance. When the weather is fine, the <HI>Parejantes,</HI> for &s;o the <HI>figurans</HI> of this eque&s;trian country dance, are called, walk in their dre&s;&s;es in the gardens of the palace, and join the &s;pectators. The &s;ubjects of <HI>Philip</HI> II. and <HI>Charles</HI> V. and tho&s;e of <HI>Charles</HI> IV. &s;eem then to be united; imagination approaches the&s;e two reigns, and compares with plea&s;ure the age of &s;plendour in Spain, with that of its regeneration.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of Aranjuez favours all the inno|cent diver&s;ions of the country; walks are no where more varied; whether with a book in your hand, you wander in the &s;hrubberies, or pa&s;s through the long allies on hor&s;eback, or in a carriage, you may &s;ecurely indulge in meditation and reverie.</P>
<P>The corps diplomatique &s;eem to enjoy them&s;elves more in this retreat, than at the other <HI>&s;itios;</HI> they live near together, give good dinners; have frequent balls; and, from day to day, they have one con|tinued round of plea&s;ant amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot we meet with none but men of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed manners, well informed
<PB N="46" REF="42">
of every thing that is pa&s;&s;ing in the world; and with the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed women, all chearful, gay and lively. "The refinements of a &s;elect &s;oci|ety like this (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) were &s;o powerfully at|tractive, that I laid by my pen, I clo&s;ed my books, and, from morning to night, had agreeable engage|ments."</P>
<P>The motions of the court are mo&s;tly uniform from day to day. Whil&s;t at Aranjuez the king common|ly amu&s;es him&s;elf with fi&s;hing till noon, when he returns to dine, like every other branch of the royal family, in public. After dinner follows a &s;hort conver&s;ation with the foreign mini&s;ters, which being fini&s;hed they retire to the garden, and he, accom|panied by the prince, leaving the palace between three and four in the afternoon, goes 20 or 30 miles to &s;hoot, following his &s;port as long as he can &s;ee.</P>
<P>The old fa&s;hioned courtiers, dine at half after one, immediately on returning from the palace; but the more modern at two o'clock, and the foreign mini&s;|ters between that and three.</P>
<P>In the evening after the <HI>&s;ie&s;ta,</HI> the prince&s;&s;es at|tended by their guards, the grandees, and &s;ome of the foreign mini&s;ters, enter their coaches, and move
<PB N="47" REF="43">
&s;lowly on, &s;aluting each other as often as they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>By the &s;ide of the long extended mall, the <HI>calle de la reyna,</HI> between Madrid and Aranguez, is a fine avenue, well filled with company, in which the prince&s;&s;es occa&s;ionally walk. If they are on foot, the whole company follows in their train: when pa&s;&s;ing in their carriages, all &s;tand &s;till to make their bow; and the cloak which was flung loo&s;ely back, or held up, or tucked under the arm, and the flap which was ca&s;t negligently over the left &s;houlder, is let fall, and hangs like the undertakers cloak, when walking at a funeral. It is plea&s;ing to &s;ee the gen|teel young Spaniard in his <HI>capa,</HI> which he throws into a thou&s;and graceful forms, each remarkable for its peculiar ea&s;e and elegance, &s;uch as no foreigner can imitate; but when he meets a per&s;on of &s;upe|rior rank, or when he goes into a church, ea&s;e and elegance are bani&s;hed by decorum, and this <HI>capa,</HI> &s;o much to be admired, degenerates into the &s;tiff|ne&s;s and formality of a cloak.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h ladies di&s;cover the &s;ame ta&s;te in wearing the <HI>mantilla,</HI> a kind of mu&s;lin &s;hawl, cover|ing the head and &s;houlders, and &s;erving the va|rious purpo&s;es of the hood, the cloak, and the veil. No foreigner can ever attain their ea&s;e or ele|gance in this &s;imple dre&s;s. In the Spani&s;h women,
<PB N="48" REF="44">
the <HI>mantilla</HI> appears to have no weight. Lighter than air, it &s;eems to &s;upply the place of wings.</P>
<P>One evening, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> when this public walk was thronged with ladies, many of whom were richly dre&s;&s;ed; on the tinkling of a little bell, at a di&s;tance &s;carce to be heard, in one moment all were upon their knees. Upon a&s;king a lady what was the matter, &s;he told me <HI>his Maje&s;ty</HI> was pa&s;&s;ing. Had I enquired of a Frenchman, he would have &s;aid, <HI>'c'e&s;t le bon dieu qui pa&s;&s;e.'</HI> Her looks pointed me to the &s;pot, where two ladies of high fa&s;hion had quitted their carriage to the ho&s;t, which the prie&s;ts were carrying to &s;ome dying chri&s;tian. Had it been the rainy &s;ea&s;on, they mu&s;t have done the &s;ame; and had the public walk been even wet and dirty, none would have been excu&s;ed from kneeling.</P>
<P>At a ball at this place, &s;ays the above writer, I had the happine&s;s to &s;ee Madame <HI>Mello,</HI> dance a <HI>volero.</HI> Her motions were &s;o graceful, that whil&s;t &s;he was dancing &s;he appeared to be the mo&s;t beautiful wo|man in the room: but &s;he had no &s;ooner retired to her &s;eat than the delu&s;ion vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>This dance bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to the <HI>fan|dango,</HI> at lea&s;t in &s;prightline&s;s and elegance; but then it is more correct than that favourite, yet a mo&s;t la&s;civious, pantomime. The <HI>fandango</HI> it&s;elf is
<PB N="49" REF="45">
bani&s;hed from genteel a&s;&s;emblies, and ju&s;tly &s;o. As danced by the vulgar it is mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting; as re|fined in higher life, covered with a mo&s;t elegant yet tran&s;parent veil, it cea&s;es to di&s;gu&s;t; and from that very circum&s;tance excites tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in the youthful brea&s;t, which wi&s;dom finds it difficult to curb. This dance mu&s;t certainly come to them by tradition from the Moors. The mu&s;ic of it has &s;uch a powerful effect on young and old, that all are pre|pared for motion the in&s;tant that the in&s;truments are heard. "And from what I have &s;een (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) I could almo&s;t per&s;uade my&s;elf that, were it &s;uddenly introduced into a church, or a court of judicature, prie&s;ts and people, judges and crimi|nals, the grave&s;t and the gay, would forget all di&s;|tinctions, and begin to dance.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of Toledo, and its Environs.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of Toledo is uncertain. According to <HI>Sylva,</HI> in his Enquiry concerning the Manner in which Spain was Peopled, &s;ome Jews e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="50" REF="46">
them&s;elves in the place where Toledo now &s;tands, 540 years before Chri&s;t, and called the city they founded, <HI>Toledath,</HI> which, in their language, &s;ignifies <HI>Mother of the People.</HI> This origin is equally noble and doubtful. Two hundred and twenty-three years before the Chri&s;tian aera, <HI>Hannibal</HI> added Toledo, with Ca&s;tille, to the empire of Carthage. From thence it pa&s;&s;ed under the dominion of the Romans; and, in 467, <HI>Eurico,</HI> the &s;eventh &s;overeign of the Goths, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this city. In that line the &s;ceptre continued more than 240 years, when the Moors entered Spain, and in three years over|ran the whole kingdom, and Toledo &s;ubmitted to its fate A. D. 714. From this time to the final ex|pul&s;ion of the Moors, in 1085, Toledo was the object for which mo&s;t blood was &s;hed. <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> VI. who re&s;cued this city, &s;tiled him&s;elf Emperor of Toledo, whence it took, and has pre&s;erved the title of royal and imperial.</P>
<P>This famous city, once the &s;eat of empire, where the arts and &s;ciences&mdash;where trade and manufac|tures flouri&s;hed&mdash;is now brought to ruin and decay, and is kept in exi&s;tence only by the church. This city, which contained 200,000 &s;ouls, is now reduced to le&s;s than 25,000. The citizens are fled, the monks remain.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Toledo is remarkable. The
<PB N="51" REF="47">
Tagus, pa&s;&s;ing between two granite mountains' and almo&s;t &s;urrounding one of the&s;e, forms a penin|&s;ula, on which the city &s;tands, appearing at a di&s;|tance like a cone.</P>
<P>Toledo is 12 leagues from Madrid. Solitary &s;treets, hou&s;es in ruins, and the almo&s;t total ab&s;ence of indu&s;try and affluence, but ill agree with the idea formed of a city, fir&s;t in rank of the cortes of the kingdom of Ca&s;tille, which, for a long &s;eries of years pa&s;&s;ed for its capital, and of which all the monuments prove its ancient &s;plendour. Ma|drid, which, in the latter centuries, increa&s;ed its population at the expence of the neighbouring cities, laid Toledo, in particular, under heavy contributions. The a&s;pect of the ruins and barren|ne&s;s of the environs, concur in giving it an appear|ance of wretchedne&s;s in &s;ome re&s;pects, however contradicted, when we enter their hou&s;es, which are clean and neat in the extreme &mdash; a plea&s;ing &s;ight, and &s;eldom to be &s;een where poverty re&s;ides. The inhabitants of Toledo are not in this re&s;pect, much inferior to the Dutch; and the pains the latter take about their walls, their windows, and their furniture, are employed by the former in de|fending their habitations from the &s;un, and pro|curing coolne&s;s even in the dog-days. "In vi&s;iting &s;everal of the&s;e little man&s;ions (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>)
<PB N="52" REF="48">
I thought my&s;elf tran&s;ported into the palace of &s;leep: Nothing di&s;turbed the calm of their peace|ful inhabitants. At three in the afternoon, the win|dows and lattices &s;hut, the floors moi&s;tened by frequent &s;prinklings, and large &s;heets &s;pread over their courts, all concurred to make us forget the heat of the climate, and the hour of the day.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try of the inhabitants was not long &s;ince confined to the&s;e effeminate inventions. Within a few years they have &s;haken off that <HI>&s;tupor</HI> to which they &s;eemed condemned. Their prelate declared open war again&s;t indolence and wretchedne&s;s. His immen&s;e alms, above &pound;2000 &s;terling annually, were unequal to the beneficence of his intentions. He therefore fitted up the Alcazar, a palace which had been the re&s;idence of the Gothic kings, and after|wards that of <HI>Charles</HI> V. and converted it into an <HI>ho|&s;picio,</HI> or general workhou&s;e for the poor. This palace had been &s;uffered to decay, till &s;ome lovers of the arts, mourning over the ruins of this once &s;tately pile, made repre&s;entations to the king, and urged him to repair it. This, at the expence of &pound;50,000 was undertaken by the archbi&s;hop, and re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine grandeur. All the magnificent apart|ments are now occupied with &s;pinning-wheels and looms; and, in&s;tead of princes are filled with beg|gars. In the&s;e they work, and in the under-ground
<PB N="53" REF="49">
&s;tory which had been the &s;tables, they have their dormitory.</P>
<P>This palace was almo&s;t rebuilt by <HI>Charles</HI> V. it is &s;ituated on a &s;teep hill, and commands a very fine pro&s;pect; it has 11 windows in front, and is three &s;tories high; the inner court is very grand; its co|lonnade of granite columns, of the Corinthian or|der, makes a noble appearance; the grand &s;tair|ca&s;e is of very fine architecture; the chapel is lofty and narrow, which renders it very convenient to attend divine &s;ervice, there being a balcony in each &s;tory of the hou&s;e leading into it. The &s;tables, which are under-ground, are capable of containing 5000 hor&s;es. The attic &s;tory is one open gallery for playing in, above 240 in length. In the middle &s;tories are &s;everal large halls; one of them has a very remarkable echo, to be equalled by none, except that of the Simonetti palace near Milan.</P>
<P>The good archbi&s;hop here feeds 700 per&s;ons em|ployed in the &s;ilk manufactory; but unfortunately, with the be&s;t intentions, he has completed the ruin of the city; for, by his weight of capital, he has rai&s;ed the price of labour, and of the raw materials; whil&s;t by carrying a greater quantity of goods to the common market, he has &s;unk the price of the commodity &s;o much, that the manufacturers, who
<PB N="54" REF="50">
employed from 40 to 60 workmen, now employ only two or three, and many who were in affluence, are now reduced to penury.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are &s;o far from earning their own maintenance, that over and above the produce of their labour, they require 40,000 ducats a year for their &s;upport. If we reckon the ducat at 2<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> &frac12;, we &s;hall find the &s;um amounts to &pound;6 10 and a frac|tion, for each pauper, which alone, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their work, &s;hould &s;uffice for two of them. Of the&s;e 40,000 ducats, the archbi&s;hop gives 20,000 to the church, and the church &s;upplies the re&s;t.</P>
<P>From the univer&s;al experience of mankind, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that if the mo&s;t able &s;ilk manufacturer in Europe, who, in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion, has acquired wealth, were to feed, to clothe, and to employ 700 people upon the &s;ame terms, either with the&s;e in the Alcazar, or with tho&s;e who belong to &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hments in England, France, or Spain, he would &s;oon be reduced to po|verty. For health, for comfort, for profit, for popu|lation, let every family occupy a &s;eparate cottage, and learn to live on the produce of its indu&s;try. From not having a right under&s;tanding on this &s;ub|ject, benevolence in England, France, and Spain, mu&s;t &s;igh and &s;ay, 'When I would do good, evil
<PB N="55" REF="51">
is pre&s;ent with me.' Such e&s;tabli&s;hments increa&s;e the evils they mean to remedy, and aggravate the di&s;tre&s;s they were intended to relieve.</P>
<P>The cathedral is one of the mo&s;t noble &s;acred edifices in Europe. Its foundation is dated as far back as the end of the &s;ixth century. During 400 years, it was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Moors, and pro|faned by the Mahometan wor&s;hip. The building it&s;elf, the carving, the pictures, and the trea&s;ures it contains, all attract and rivet the attention. This magnificent church is 404 feet long, and 203 feet wide; it contains five ai&s;les, and the highe&s;t of the&s;e is 160 feet. The choir is covered with carv|ings, repre&s;enting the conque&s;t of Granada, exe|cuted in a mo&s;t &s;uperior &s;tile. The eye is never weary of examining the&s;e monuments of con&s;um|mate &s;kill. Among the pictures are the works of the be&s;t ma&s;ters. In the library they have near 700 manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ures of this cathedral, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> &s;truck me with a&s;toni&s;hment. <HI>La Cu&s;todia,</HI> an ele|gant &s;ilver model of the cathedral, weighs 22,000 ounces, and took 55 ounces of pure gold for gild|ing. It contains a multitude of pillars, and more than 200 little images of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. In the centre of this edifice, is placed a &s;hrine of ma&s;&s;ive gold, weighing 50 pounds; another occa|&s;ionally
<PB N="56" REF="52">
&s;upplying the place of this, contains a &s;ta|tue of the infant of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> made of pure gold, and adorned with 800 precious &s;tones. In four &s;eparate clo&s;ets, are four large &s;ilver images, &s;tanding on globes of &s;ilver, each two feet diameter, repre&s;ent|ing Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America, with their &s;everal emblems. The grand &s;ilver throne, on which is placed the Virgin, wearing a crown, and adorned with a profu&s;ion of the mo&s;t co&s;tly gems, weighs 50 <HI>arrobas,</HI> which at 25 pounds the <HI>arroba,</HI> is equal to 1250 pounds. In the chapel of the Virgin, is an al|tar, covered with gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>It is evident, that this profu&s;ion of wealth, has ari&s;en from the pious donations of the Spani&s;h princes, out of the immen&s;e trea&s;ures obtained from their gold and &s;ilver mines, on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America. The value of the&s;e donations may be a&s;|certained with ea&s;e; but no pen can e&s;timate, no fi|gures calculate, no imagination conceive, what would have been their value, if, in&s;tead of being thus buried, and as far as relates to any u&s;eful pur|po&s;e, lo&s;t; it had been employed in making ea&s;y communications through the kingdom, by roads and canals, or in the improvement of the &s;oil by draining, by planting, and by watering, or in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, by premiums and by loans, of u&s;eful manu|factures, &s;uited to the genius of the people, and to the nature of the country. If that overflowing
<PB N="57" REF="53">
wealth had been diverted into profitable channels, what might Spain have been! <HI>Dicite pontifices, in &s;ancto quid facit aurum!</HI> 'What has gold to do in the &s;anctuary?' We may venture to &s;ay, that if the gold and &s;ilver of America, in&s;tead of being buried in the churches, or, which is wor&s;e, in&s;tead of pam|pering the pride, the prodigality, and the unprofit|able luxury of the great; or, which is wor&s;t of all, in&s;tead of being idly &s;quandered in u&s;ele&s;s, and al|mo&s;t endle&s;s wars, if all this gold and &s;ilver had been devoted to Ceres, Spain would have been her mo&s;t favourite re&s;idence, and the whole penin&s;ula one continued garden.</P>
<P>The revenues of the cathedral, is, perhaps, not to be equalled by any church in Europe. The archbi&s;hop has 9,000,000 of reals a year, which makes about &pound;90,000 &s;terling; a revenue fit for a &s;overeign prince. Be&s;ides the archbi&s;hop, there are 40 canons, 50 prebendiaries, and 50 chaplains. The whole body of eccle&s;ia&s;tics belonging to this cathedral, are 600, all well provided for. The pope and the king of Spain, are always canons of this cathedral.</P>
<P>There is an a&s;ylum open at Toledo to &s;uffering humanity, viz. an ho&s;pital for the in&s;ane. There are two principal ones in Spain; one at Sarago&s;&s;a, and the other at Toledo, I went &s;everal times to the latter, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> and was always &s;urpri&s;ed at
<PB N="58" REF="54">
the cleanline&s;s and regularity, which I con&s;tantly found there.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of &s;uch a place, has always &s;omething in it afflicting to humanity, even when viewed with the curious eye of philo&s;ophy; but I confe&s;s I never felt the &s;entiment of tho&s;e who &s;ay they are hum|bled at the &s;ight of this degradation of human rea&s;on. We never feel humiliation, except we can make compari&s;ons to our own di&s;advantage. What cla&s;s in the creation is better treated than the human &s;pecies? If any other be &s;o, is our &s;ituation in life &s;uch, as to make us blu&s;h before it? Shame &s;uppo&s;es a reciprocal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, between the being that feels, and that by which it is cau&s;ed. We know not angels; bea&s;ts are unacquainted with us, and in&s;anity being an involuntary defect, from which no one is &s;ecure, in what manner can any in|dividual of the human &s;pecies feel humiliation at the &s;ight of a madman; he him&s;elf would not feel it, were he capable of rea&s;oning. The drunkard and pa&s;&s;ionate are tho&s;e that ought to blu&s;h; they rebel again&s;t the rea&s;on which would re&s;train them. The madman, no longer under its empire, is &s;lave of a power which has &s;ubjugated him without his con&s;ent. He is not to be pitied, unle&s;s when lucid intervals give him knowledge of his &s;ituation. Except in the&s;e ca&s;es, a wretch racked with the gout, &s;eems to have greater claim to compa&s;&s;ion. With the&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="55">
preliminary ob&s;ervations, the a&s;ylums of humanity de&s;poiled of its mo&s;t exalted endowment, may be entered with greater compo&s;ure. There was but one man raving mad in the ho&s;pital of Toledo; he was a prie&s;t, who, from the wretched bed to which he was chained, uttered uninterrupted execrations again&s;t the principal per&s;onages of the kingdom of Spain. I beheld in him, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> only a ferocious bea&s;t in a human form, who&s;e roarings were articulated by words. Without blaming or pitying him, I fled from his approach. His com|panions were much le&s;s frightful. I particularly remarked a Franci&s;can monk, who had pre&s;erved his habit, and had wrapped up his head in a wig, made of paper; his only mania was that of mount|ing on a &s;tone, and thence, as from a pulpit, deli|vering &s;craps of &s;ermons, which he mingled with fa|cetious jokes, and ended with making capers. In 1783, I pa&s;&s;ed a quarter of an hour among his au|dience; two years afterwards, I again appeared be|fore him, and was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at his re+collecting me. I admired this inexplicable &s;ingula|rity of nature, which in &s;o &s;everely treating his intel|lectual faculties, had &s;till pre&s;erved to him a happy memory. Is not this another problem for meta|phy&s;ics to re&s;olve?</P>
<P>Near this city, is to be &s;een part of an aqueduct erected to convey on a level with the Alcazar, the
<PB N="60" REF="56">
water from a &s;pring &s;even or eight leagues from To|ledo. This is one of tho&s;e works, equally u&s;eful and magnificent, by which the Romans have marked their re&s;idence in &s;everal places in Spain; nor is this the only Roman monument of which the remains are found in the environs of Toledo. Near a con|vent of the Minimes, are the ruins of a circus; and not far from thence, may be di&s;cerned the traces of an old Roman road.</P>
<P>Thus the Romans, the Arabians, the Goths, and the Spaniards of the time of <HI>Charles</HI> V. by turns embelli&s;hed and improved Toledo. We cannot &s;ay &s;o much for the pre&s;ent race. Hou&s;es out of re|pair, fine edifices going to ruin, few or no manufac|tures, a population con&s;iderably reduced, and the mo&s;t barren environs are all that now offer them|&s;elves to the &s;ight of the travellers, drawn thither by the reputation of that famous city. Under the late reign, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful efforts were made, to recover it from the univer&s;al decay into which it is fallen. We have &s;een that the archbi&s;hop has rebuilt part of the Alcazar, and e&s;tabli&s;hed there &s;ome manufactures of &s;ilk. The blades of Toledo were formerly fa|mous for their temper and &s;olidity. <HI>Charles</HI> III. erected a very &s;pacious edifice for making them; and the experiments already made, &s;eem to promi&s;e that the modern citizens of Toledo, will not, in this re&s;pect, be long inferior to their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="57"><HI>Twi&s;s</HI> &s;ays, that all the &s;word, hanger, and dagger-blades for the Spani&s;h army, are made in this city, but that they are far from being &s;o well tempered, as in former times; a true old Toledo &s;word-blade, &s;ells even in Spain for &s;ix or &s;even guineas, and can be purcha&s;ed only by chance. There are daggers that have been made here, which will &s;trike through a crown-piece. The &s;teel is &s;till excellent, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> and &s;o perfectly tempered, that at thru&s;t|ing at a target, the &s;words will bend like whalebone, and yet cut through a helmet, without turning their edge.</P>
<P><HI>Peyron</HI> adds, that the &s;ecret of hardening them, has again been recovered, and that experiments have been made with blades lately fabricated here, which &s;eem to ju&s;tify this a&s;&s;ertion. When one of the&s;e has undergone the operation of tempering, if it is in the lea&s;t notched by &s;triking with it &s;everal blows on an iron head-piece, it is rejected. All &s;word-blades made for the &s;oldiers, have the king's name engraven on one &s;ide, and &s;ome device on the other, &s;uch as, <HI>'No me &s;aques &s;in ragon, na me embaines &s;in honor.'</HI> 'Draw me not without rea&s;on, &s;heath me not without honour.'</P>
<Q><L>Virgil &s;ays, <HI>'At Chalybes nudi ferrum, &amp;c.'</HI></L>

<P><PB N="62" REF="58">It is likewi&s;e remarked by <HI>Diodorus Siculas,</HI> that the Celtiberians gave &s;uch temper to their &s;teel, that no helmet could re&s;i&s;t their &s;troke.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this city would &s;carce par|don us, were we to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence their <HI>Cigar|rales:</HI> The&s;e are little country hou&s;es, re&s;embling tho&s;e in the environs of Mar&s;eilles, except that they are le&s;s ornamented, and not &s;o numerous.

In the barren part of Ca&s;tille, they are delightful retreats, offering in the heat of the dog-days, coolne&s;s and repo&s;e, amid&s;t the &s;hade of orchards. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to ar|rive at them, except by cro&s;&s;ing parched and un|&s;haded meadows, or climing &s;teep and rugged precipices.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Province of Old Ca&s;tille.</HEAD>
<P>THE name of Old Ca&s;tille was given to this pro|vince, as being recovered from the Moors, &s;ooner than New Ca&s;tille. On the &s;outh it is bounded by New Ca&s;tille; on the we&s;t by Leon; on the north by A&s;turia and Bi&s;cay; and on the ea&s;t by Navarre and Arragon. Its figure is irregular, and con&s;e|quently its dimen&s;ions very different. Its greate&s;t length from Valladolid to Tarracona, is about 112 Engli&s;h miles, and its greate&s;t breadth about 180. The principal rivers are the Duoro and the Ebro. The &s;ources of all the rivers are in this province, which is mountainous, and not near &s;o fertile as New Ca&s;tille. The mo&s;t fruitful part, is a tract lying north near Medina. The wine produced here is ex|cellent; and its plains are covered with cattle, par|ticularly &s;heep, the wool of which is the be&s;t in all Spain. It was formerly only a country, &s;ubject to the kings of Leon; but in 1016, was erected into a kingdom. The mo&s;t remarkable cities, which claim
<PB N="64" REF="60">
the attention of travellers, are Burgos its ancient capital, Valladolid, and Segovia: of the&s;e we &s;hall treat in their turn.</P>
<P>Burgos, the capital of Old Ca&s;tille, is very agree|ably &s;ituated; the greate&s;t part of it, is on the right of the Arlaneon, over which there are three bridges. This river de&s;cribes the arch of a circle round Bur|gos, and on the other &s;ide is a hill, upon which there &s;till remains &s;ome ruins of an old fort. The Arla|neon embelli&s;hes and fertili&s;es all the environs; it renders flouri&s;hing the plantations, which &s;erve as public walks, waters the verdant meadows, and wa&s;hes the walls of two remarkable edifices, &s;ituated below the city: the fir&s;t is a convent of nuns, the abbe&s;s of which has con&s;iderable privileges; and is the be&s;t endowed in Spain. The other is the royal ho&s;pital, remarkable for the extreme cleanline&s;s pre|&s;erved in it, and the healthine&s;s of its &s;ituation. The mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations might take example from the Spaniards, with re&s;pect to their charitable founda|tions.</P>
<P>There is nothing remarkable in Burgos, except its cathedral, one of the mo&s;t magnificent and be&s;t pre|&s;erved of the ancient gothic edifices, now exi&s;ting in Europe. Its form is exactly the &s;ame as that of York Min&s;ter, which may be &s;aid to be the crite|rion, according to which the beauties and defects
<PB N="65" REF="61">
of every Gothic church are to be e&s;timated. We are &s;truck (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) with the re&s;emblance between the&s;e two buildings; both were embelli&s;hed with a profu&s;ion of &s;tatues; mo&s;t of tho&s;e at York were de&s;troyed in the fir&s;t emotions of Iconocla&s;tic zeal; tho&s;e of Burgos are &s;till in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the homages of the country, and con&s;equently entire. The foliage-work, arches, pillar, and battlements, are executed in the mo&s;t elaborate and fini&s;hed man|ner, of that &s;tile which has u&s;ually been called <HI>Go|thic.</HI> Of late this appellation has been exploded, and that of <HI>Arabic</HI> &s;ub&s;tituted for it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) I &s;ee &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt of the propriety of this &s;econd epithet. The churches of our ance&s;tors &s;hoot up into &s;pires, towers, pinnacles, &s;illagree-work, and no &s;uch thing as a cupola &s;eems ever to have been attempted; the mo&s;ques and other buildings of the Arabians, are rounded into domes, and coved roofs, with now and then a &s;lender &s;quare minaret, terminating in a ball or pine-apple; the Arabic walls &s;hine with painted tiles, mo&s;aics, and &s;tucco, none of which ever appear in our ancient edifices.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e differential marks, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that our old &s;tructures have been new named, and Mahometani&s;ed, without &s;ufficient proof of their Arabic origin. At the &s;ame time
<PB N="66" REF="62">
it mu&s;t be acknowledged that it is difficult to find them a more &s;atisfactory and genuine pedigree.</P>
<P>The be&s;t age of that &s;tile of con&s;truction began in England, in the reign of <HI>Henry III.</HI> for till then we built in the clum&s;y manner called Saxon, de&s;ti|tute of every recommendation but &s;olidity; the new ta&s;te came, in all probability, from France, introduced by &s;ome Provencals that followed the Queen. If we &s;uppo&s;e it imported into that king|dom by tho&s;e that returned from the cru&s;ades, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e &s;et it down as an Ea&s;tern invention. The que&s;tion is what part of the Ea&s;t it came from, and whether it was the &s;ame as that employed by the Arabians. If there were clear proofs of its be|ing a branch of the Arabic architecture, it would &s;till appear extraordinary, that its very fir&s;t intro|duction into Chri&s;tendom &s;hould be attended with &s;o great a variation from the models it was meant to imitate; and that any prince, or learned prie&s;t, that thought it worthy of being employed in his country, &s;hould &s;et about new fa&s;hioning it in all its points.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons have &s;u&s;pected it to have been the manner practi&s;ed by the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians, and not adopted by the Arabs; who might di&s;dain to have any thing &s;imilar in their places of wor&s;hip with tho&s;e of a conquered people. Others have
<PB N="67" REF="63">
been of opinion that it comes originally from Per|&s;ia, or further Ea&s;t; and &s;ome again maintain it to be an European invention, or at lea&s;t a barbarous mode of building, brought by &s;ome great genius to the elegant proportion we behold in our cathe|drals.</P>
<P>The civdad of Valladolid, anciently called <HI>Pindia,</HI> is a large, beautiful, and populous city, &s;ituated in a &s;pacious and delightful plain, watered by the <HI>Pi&s;u|erga.</HI> It is one of the mo&s;t &s;tately cities in Spain, having long, broad, fine &s;treets, with large and lofty hou&s;es, &s;plendid palaces, &s;pacious and elegant &s;quares, piazzas, and fountains, 70 convents, &s;ix ho&s;pitals for the &s;ick, for infants, and for lunatics, and 20,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity has more than 2,000 &s;tudents. In the year 1346, this &s;eminary was in&s;tituted, and, A. D. 1784 to 1785, there entered, and were ma|triculated 2000 &s;tudents.</P>
<P>The king's palace, rather elegant than grand, is &s;till pre&s;erved; but all the palaces of the great nobi|lity are going to decay.</P>
<P>In the royal palace <HI>Philips II.</HI> and <HI>III.</HI> were born; and here <HI>Charles V.</HI> received the news that his vic|torious
<PB N="68" REF="64">
troops had taken Rome, and made the Pope his pri&s;oner; and from hence he ordered prayers to be offered up in all the churches of Spain, for the de|liverance of the Sovereign Pontiff. In this city, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, likewi&s;e, kept their court, till <HI>Philip IV.</HI> removed it to Madrid.</P>
<P>As we have mentioned <HI>Charles V.</HI> we &s;hall add a &s;hort quotation from the Abb&eacute; <HI>de la Porte</HI> &mdash; he &s;ays, on vi&s;iting the mona&s;tery of <HI>St Ju&s;t,</HI> at no great di&s;tance, he was &s;hewn by one of the monks the place where that Emperor had lodged, "There, (&s;aid he &s;neeringly) is the melancholy &s;olitude where that monarch, become imbecile and devout, pa&s;&s;ed his days in winding up clocks, in teazing the Friars, in giving him&s;elf the di&s;cipline, in daubing the walls of his cell with &s;craps on prede&s;tination and grace, in &s;tunning him&s;elf with reflecting on the abandon|ment of his crown, and in repenting. There he performed the farce of his own burial, put him&s;elf in a coffin, &s;ung for him&s;elf the <HI>de profundis,</HI> and &s;hewed all the follies of a di&s;tempered brain."</P>
<P>The large field, called <HI>El Campo Grande,</HI> is with|in the walls, and round it are 15 churches. On this &s;pot many thou&s;ands of heretics have been burnt alive by order of the Inqui&s;ition; but none of the&s;e execrable executions have taken place for many years.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="65">All the public walks are ornamented with trees, &s;ome of which are delightfully &s;ituated on the banks of the Pi&s;guera. The country round this city is a perfect garden, watered by the Norias. It pro|duces white wine of a good quality, excellent mad|der, &s;ome &s;ilk, and a few olives.</P>
<P>Valladolid is not wholly without manufactures; &s;ome &s;tuffs and coar&s;e cloths are made there, from the wool of the &s;heep kept in the neighbourhood. There are al&s;o gold and &s;ilver&s;miths; and one &s;treet is entirely inhabited by jewellers.</P>
<P>This city, though fallen from its ancient &s;plendor, on the fini&s;hing of the projected canal may recover it again.</P>
<P>This canal begins at Segovia; 16 leagues north of Madrid; from Segovia, quitting the Ere&s;ma, it cro&s;&s;es the Pi&s;uerga, near Valladolid, and proceeds to Reino&s;a. At Reino&s;a is the communication with the canal of Arragon, which unites the Medi|terranean to the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>They have already completed 20 leagues of it, which has co&s;t near &pound;400,000 which is about &pound;4,318 per mile. It is nine feet deep, 20 feet wide at bot|tom, and 56 at top; and, when perfected, which may be in le&s;s than 20 years, the world will,
<PB N="70" REF="66">
perhaps, have nothing of the kind to be compared with it, either in point of workman&s;hip, extent, or utility.</P>
<P>Segovia is a city of great antiquity, and &s;till con&s;iderable. It &s;tands high between two hills, be|ing large, populous, and hand&s;ome, having excel|lent manufactures of cloth and paper; and export|ing al&s;o a very fine &s;ort of wool. In Segovia, the fir&s;t object to attract the eye is the aqueduct, a mo&s;t amazing fabric of antiquity, carried from one mountain to another, to the length of 3000 paces, and &s;upported by two rows of 76 lofty arches: it pa&s;&s;es through the &s;uburbs, and conveys water to the whole city.</P>
<P>Antiquaries have not agreed upon the time of its erection. The Romans were certainly the builders of it, but no in&s;cription remains &s;ufficiently legible to lead to the knowledge of the preci&s;e period of their empire, in which it was con&s;tructed. It is likely to remain in its pre&s;ent &s;tate as long as Segovia exi&s;ts; for the &s;ituation of that city, on a dry rock, renders this &s;upply indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>The principal buildings in this city are the ca|thedral and the Alcazar.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="67">The cathedral is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t churches in Spain, in the late&s;t Gothic manner. The in&s;ide is maje&s;tic, and remarkably clear of the embara&s;s|ments of altars and chapels, &s;o common throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>The Alcazar, or palace, formerly the re&s;idence of the Gothic kings, &s;tands in one of the fine&s;t po&s;i|tions po&s;&s;ible, on a rock, ri&s;ing above the open country; a very pretty river wa&s;hes the foot of the precipice, and the city lies admirably well on the brow of the hill; the declivity is woody, and the banks charmingly rural; the &s;nowy mountains, and dark fore&s;ts of St. Ildefon&s;o compo&s;e an awful back-ground to the picture. Towards the town there is a large court before the great tower, which, having been the pri&s;on of <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> is &s;o well de|&s;cribed by <HI>Le Sage,</HI> that the &s;ubject requires no far|ther explanation. The re&s;t of the buildings form an antique palace, which has &s;eldom been inhabited by any but pri&s;oners, &s;ince the reign of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who were much attached to this &s;itua|tion. There are &s;ome magnificent halls in it, with much gilding in the ceilings, in a &s;emi-barbarous ta&s;te. All the kings of Spain are &s;eated in &s;tate along the cornice of the great &s;aloon. The royal apartments are now occupied by a college of young gentlemen cadets, educated at the king's expence, in all the &s;ciences requi&s;ite for forming an engineer.
<PB N="72" REF="68">
The grand ma&s;ter of the ordnance re&s;ides at Segovia, which is the head e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Spani&s;h ar|tillery.</P>
<P>Another court of the palace is allotted as a pri&s;on to Algerine captains of &s;hips. Their crews work in the ar&s;enal of Carthagena. Mo&s;t of their time is &s;pent in conver&s;ation, walking up and down a long gallery, &s;moaking, and playing at che&s;s, except when they go down, at &s;tated hours, to fetch water for their own u&s;e. Confinement apart, their lives pa&s;s in ca&s;e and tranquillity.</P>
<P>The mint is &s;ituated at the bottom of the city, upon the &s;mall river Ere&s;ma. The whole machi|nery for coining is moved by water-wheels, by means of which the metal is weighed, cut, beat|en, &s;tamped, and milled, as it were, in a moment. This is the mo&s;t ancient of the three mints in Spain; the other two are at Seville and Madrid.</P>
<P>The head attire of the married women of this province has &s;omething very &s;ingular in its appear|ance; it con&s;i&s;ts of a black perriwig, faced all round with the wool of a black lamb, ending behind in two long plaited tre&s;&s;es, that reach down to their rumps. Previous to their nuptials, they are obliged to make up this elegant kind of helmet, which ren|ders their natural ugline&s;s &s;till more horrible. They

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of Leon, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall now proceed to &s;peak of the remain|ing provinces, on the northern part of this king|dom; the&s;e are, Leon, Bi&s;cay, Navarre, A&s;turia, and Gallicia, the la&s;t four lie on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which forms part of the Bay of Bi&s;cay. The principal &s;ea-port in this bay is Bilboa. In the province or kingdom of Leon, is the city of Salamanca, famous for its univer&s;ity. Be&s;ides the&s;e two towns, there are few others of any celebrity. Before, however, we &s;peak of the&s;e cities, we &s;hall, as we have already done, give &s;ome general view of each province, cla&s;&s;ing whatever may be intere&s;ting under its re&s;pective territory.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Leon is bounded on the north by A&s;turias, on the we&s;t by Gallicia and Portugal, on the &s;outh by E&s;tramadura, and on the Ea&s;t by Old Ca&s;tille. Its extent, from north to &s;outh, is near 200 miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about 100. The &s;oil produces all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, parti|cularly the di&s;tricts of Vierzo and Lede&s;ma. The
<PB N="76" REF="72">
wine likewi&s;e is tolerably good; and in this pro|vince are mines of turquois. "All the way from Leon, the ancient capital of this province, to Sala|manca, (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) the country is &s;o flat and open, that the Moori&s;h hor&s;e, when they invaded Spain, mu&s;t have met with nothing to impede their progre&s;s; becau&s;e in &s;uch exten&s;ive plains, an op|pre&s;&s;ed people, di&s;pirited and di&s;armed, could have little inclination to make re&s;i&s;tance; and, had it not been for a more hardy race, inhabiting the moun|tains of the north, the whole penin&s;ula might at this moment have been numbered among the fol|lowers of Mahomet. The principal river is the Douro, dividing the province into two nearly equal parts, and after pa&s;&s;ing through Portugal, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Leon, the capital of the province, was built by the Romans, in the time of the Emperor Galba, and called <HI>Legio Septima Germanica,</HI> from whence the name Leon is derived. It lies at the end of a large plain, bounded by the mountains of the A&s;tu|rias. The cathedral is famous, not only for its beauty, but for having been the burial-place of &s;e|veral Saints, 37 Kings of Spain, and one Emperor. The city was formerly much larger, richer, and more populous, than at pre&s;ent. It was the fir&s;t city of any con&s;equence, that was retaken from the
<PB N="77" REF="73">
Moors, and the &s;eat of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of Spain.</P>
<P>All the churches of this city, like tho&s;e of Arra|gon, are crowded with pillars, which are nearly hid with prepo&s;terous ornaments, &s;uch as vines, cherubs, angels, and birds, covered entirely with gold.</P>
<P>This city, de&s;titute of commerce, is &s;upported by the church. Beggars are to be &s;een in every &s;treet, who are fed by the convents and at the bi&s;hop's palace. Here they get their breakfa&s;t, and here they dine. Be&s;ides food they receive, every day at one, of the convents, the men a farthing, and the women and children half as much. On this provi&s;ion they live, marry, and perpetuate a mi&s;erable race. An <HI>ho&s;pi|cio,</HI> or general workhou&s;e, is nearly fini&s;hed to re|ceive them; but, if alms continue to be thus di&s;|tributed, the &s;ame number of wretches will in time occupy the place of tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;ent into con|finement.</P>
<P>The &s;urrounding country is bold and beautiful, but ill cultivated. This city is watered by two little &s;treams, which unite below the city. The&s;e, in &s;ummer, might be called brooks, in winter they are torrents.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="74">With the rolling &s;tones hurried down from the mountains, by the impetuous raging of the&s;e tor|rents, on the melting of the &s;now, a great part of the wall is built; which forms a valuable collection for the naturali&s;t, who wi&s;hes without labour, to inve&s;tigate the nature of the country. Among the&s;e are found lime&s;tone, &s;chi&s;t, and grit. All the&s;e prove, by their extraneous fo&s;&s;ils, that the hills from whence they come, were in a &s;tate of di&s;&s;olu|tion, and covered by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Salamanca, termed by the Spaniards, the mother of virtues, &s;ciences, and arts, is &s;ituated on little hills, and in a plain, watered by the river Tormes. It lies 35 leagues north-we&s;t of Madrid. It is an ex|ten&s;ive, rich, and populous city, abounding in all the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t beautiful part of this city is the great &s;quare, built about 30 years ago. The hou&s;es are of three &s;tories, and all of equal height and exact &s;ym|metry, with iron balconies, and a &s;tone ballu&s;trade at the top of them; the lower part is arched, which forms a piazza all round the &s;quare, of 293 feet to each &s;ide. Over &s;ome of the arches are medal|lions, with bad bu&s;ts of the Kings of Spain, and of &s;everal eminent men, in &s;tone bas-reliefs, among which are tho&s;e of Fernando Cortes, Francis Pizarro, Davila, and Cid Ruy.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="75">The piazza is not more to be admired for its beauty in the day, than for the protection it affords by night; becau&s;e, in this city, they have an exe|crable cu&s;tom, both offen&s;ive to the no&s;trils, and de&s;tructive to the cloaths, &s;imilar to that for which the inhabitants of the Old Town, in Edinburgh, have been de&s;ervedly reproached.</P>
<P>The river Tormes has a bridge of 25 arches over it, in this city, built by the Romans, and yet en|tire. There are al&s;o the remains of an old Roman cau&s;eway, leading from this city to Lerida, and from thence to Seville; there is an in&s;cription to be met with, denoting it to have been repaired by the Emperor <HI>Adrian.</HI></P>
<P>Of all the public edifices, the cathedral is the mo&s;t worthy of attention. The foundation of this ancient &s;tructure was laid A. D. 1513, but it was not fini&s;hed till 1734. The whole is beautiful, but the mo&s;t &s;triking part of this church, and of many public buildings in this city, is the &s;culpture, which merits admiration, not only for the ta&s;te therein di&s;played, but for its excellent pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The church of the Dominicans comes little &s;hort of the cathedral in point of &s;culpture. It has a re|pre&s;entation of <HI>St. Stephen</HI> &s;toned, with a crucifix above it, all as large as life, and not apparently in|jured
<PB N="80" REF="76">
by the weather. Indeed, in both the&s;e edi|fices, the carvings are in &s;ome mea&s;ure protected, not from a driving rain, but from its perpendicular de&s;cent, becau&s;e they &s;ink back as much as the thickne&s;s of the wall will permit, which is at lea&s;t &s;ix feet; and are &s;urrounded by mouldings, project|ing con&s;iderably beyond the wall. The precaution without doubt was prudent; yet &s;ome of the orna|ments, in bas-relief, pre&s;erve their &s;harpe&s;t angles, even when expo&s;ed to the full force of the de&s;tructive elements. This circum&s;tance may be readily ac|counted for, when we con&s;ider that &s;tone is a grit, which, when fir&s;t taken from the quarry, is &s;oft, but upon being expo&s;ed to the air acquires hardne&s;s. Hence it is peculiarly valuable, both to the architect and the &s;culptor; and to the&s;e properties we may attribute the beautiful monuments of art abound|ing in Salamanca.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to de&s;cribe the convents and public &s;eminaries of this once famous city; yet to pa&s;s them all in &s;ilence would be inexcu&s;able: we &s;hall briefly therefore mention &s;uch as merit at|tention.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e may certainly be reckoned the old college. Here the quadrangle is &s;mall, yet elegant; and the cloi&s;ter, with its 24 columns, one of the prettie&s;t in Salamanca: the apartments are com|modious,
<PB N="81" REF="77">
and tho&s;e of the regent are in a &s;uperior &s;tile.</P>
<P>The college of the Archbi&s;hop is built upon a larger &s;cale, more light and airy, and having four galleries, of 130 feet, with 32 columns, &s;upported by as many, which form the cloi&s;ter, it may be called magnificent.</P>
<P>Cuenca college is remarkable at pre&s;ent for its neatne&s;s and &s;implicity; but the portico, when fini&s;hed, will place it among the mo&s;t elegant build|ings of this city.</P>
<P>The college of Oviedo, with the churches of the Augu&s;tines and the Carmelites, de&s;erve attention.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e colleges and convents it were endle&s;s to enumerate the trea&s;ures and rich jewels de&s;igned for the &s;ervice of the altar. Whatever is mo&s;t va|luable, the product of Europe, A&s;ia, Africa, and America, is here collected; and the be&s;t workmen in every country have exerted all their ta&s;te and &s;kill, each in his &s;everal branch, to &s;hew the per|fection of his art. The ornaments and dre&s;&s;es of the prie&s;ts are both rich and beautiful; but the mo&s;t co&s;tly piece of furniture, in mo&s;t convents, is the <HI>cu&s;todia,</HI> that is the depo&s;itory of the Ho&s;t; or, ac|cording to the ideas of a Catholic, the throne of the
<PB N="82" REF="78">
Mo&s;t High, when, upon &s;olemn fe&s;tivals, he appears to command the adoration of mankind. It is not uncommon to expend 6000 ounces of &s;ilver upon one of the&s;e, be&s;ides gold and precious &s;tones; yet in mo&s;t of them, the workman&s;hip &s;urpa&s;&s;es the value of the materials.</P>
<P>In the year 1030, there was not a &s;ingle convent in Salamanca; and in 1480, previous to the di&s;co|very of America, they had only &s;ix for men, and three for women; but now there are 39. In 1518, they counted 11,000 virgins. At pre&s;ent, the per|&s;ons under vows are happily reduced to 1519.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are no more than 3000, yet they have 27 pari&s;h churches, with 15 chapels; and the clergy, including tho&s;e belonging to the cathedral, and tho&s;e of <HI>St. Mark,</HI> amount in the whole, to 580.</P>
<P>In a city where the convents and clergy are &s;o numerous, it may be well expected, that beggars will abound; and agreeable to this idea it is &s;een, that by the ample provi&s;ion here made for lazine&s;s, every &s;treet &s;warms with vagabonds; not merely with tho&s;e who are proper objects of compa&s;&s;ion, but with wretches, who, if compelled to work, would be found abundantly able to maintain them|&s;elves. There is, indeed, an ho&s;picio, or general
<PB N="83" REF="79">
work-hou&s;e, for their reception; but as the funds are limited, and do not amount to &pound;1,600 a year, it can &s;upport only 450 paupers. Should, how|ever, the government be inclined to increa&s;e the&s;e funds, it will make no great difference; becau&s;e the numbers both in the work-hou&s;e and the &s;treets, will always bear proportion to the food di&s;tributed. This truth can &s;carcely be inculcated too often; but we &s;hall defer our ob&s;ervations on it, till we come to treat of Cadiz.</P>
<P>Among the various implements in the ho&s;picio, there is an admirable one for weaving tape, both cheap and &s;imple in its con&s;truction, and &s;o expe|ditious in its work, that a little child weaves near 50 yards, and a woman more than 120 in a day.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity of Salamanca, was founded in the year 1200, by <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> IX. This &s;eminary &s;oon ro&s;e into importance, and became eminent in Europe by acquaintance with Arabian authors, and through them with the Greeks. Its profe&s;&s;ors tran&s;lated <HI>Aricena,</HI> who took the lead in medicine; and <HI>Averroes,</HI> who had be&s;towed much time in &s;tudying <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> but not &s;atisfied with copying from the Arabs, they laboured much them&s;elves, and became ju&s;tly famous in their day for their knowledge in juri&s;prudence, and for the progre&s;s in all the &s;ci|ences then cultivated in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="80">The &s;tudents were formerly reckoned about 16,000, but they are now much reduced; and in 1785, the number of matriculars was not quite 2000. In a curious edict of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. for the regulation of mendicity, we find a clau&s;e, permitting &s;tudents to beg, provided they have a licence from the rector; but in the pre&s;ent day, they appear to be in a more reputable condition; and few, if any, take advantage of this privilege.</P>
<P>The library is &s;pacious, and tolerably well fur|ni&s;hed with modern books; yet the bulk is tra&s;h, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;chola&s;tic divinity.</P>
<P>There is in this univer&s;ity an Iri&s;h college; three|&s;core &s;tudents are received in it at a time, and when they are &s;ent back to Ireland, the &s;ame num|ber from thence are admitted, to be like them, trained up for the mini&s;try. Their cour&s;e of edu|cation requires eight years. They are expected to come well founded in the languages; and of the time allotted to them in Spain, four years are given up to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, the remainder to divinity.</P>
<P>The mode of giving lectures, is, perhaps, pecu|liar to them&s;elves, but worthy to be followed in our univer&s;ities. The &s;tudents have que&s;tions pro|po&s;ed for their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion twice every day, and on
<PB N="85" REF="81">
the&s;e they are informed what books to read; then, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ubject to admit of a di&s;pute, it is carried on by two of them, under the direction of a moderate, who gives a&s;&s;i&s;tance when it is wanted, and guides them to the truth. When this mode of proceeding is not admi&s;&s;ible, the tutors, in&s;tead of giving formal lectures, employ them&s;elves in the examination of their pupils, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of in|&s;truction is thus greatly expedited.</P>
<P>The &s;tudents are dre&s;&s;ed in black, like prie&s;ts, and have their crowns &s;horn.</P>
<P>The lower cla&s;s of people wear large hats un|cocked, &s;ome black and &s;ome white, &s;lit &s;leeves, broad leather belts, and &s;andals made of cords.</P>
<P>About two leagues from this city is a fore&s;t of ilex, &s;tretching ea&s;t and we&s;t near 40 leagues. The acorns here are of the kind de&s;cribed by <HI>Ho|race,</HI> as the origin of war among the rude inhabi|tants of an infant world. Not au&s;tere, like tho&s;e of oak, or of the common ilex, but &s;weet and pala|table, like the che&s;nut; they are food, not merely for the &s;wine, but for the pea&s;ants, and yield con&s;i|derable profits.</P>
<P>The accommodation for travellers through this province are very indifferent, perhaps &s;ome of the
<PB N="86" REF="82">
wor&s;t throughout Spain; in the villages they are execrable. Heavy and ince&s;&s;ant rain, &s;ays <HI>Town|&s;end,</HI> compelled us to have recour&s;e for &s;helter to a mi&s;erable village, between Salamanca and Avila, called Malpartido.</P>
<P>The po&s;ada had only one bed for the u&s;e of the whole family; and as that was occupied by a lad, &s;on to the good woman of the hou&s;e, then dying of a putrid fever, we had a mo&s;t uncomfortable pro&s;|pect for the night. Be&s;ides the bed-chamber, they had as u&s;ual, a kitchen, a room of about ten feet &s;quare, with an elevated hearth in the centre of it, over which a little opening in the roof afforded a vent for the &s;moak. Around the hearth was a wide bench, which by day &s;upplied the place of chairs, and by night &s;erved the purpo&s;e of a bed. Upon this they de&s;igned to &s;catter &s;traw for me, leaving my guide to mea&s;ure his length on the bare boards at the other end of this magnificent apartment. A pa&s;s, however, from Count <HI>Campomanes,</HI> fortunately procured me a lodging in the village. Having had the curio&s;ity to mea&s;ure the room of another po&s;ada in this province, which, like mo&s;t of tho&s;e in Spain, &s;erved the double purpo&s;e of bed-chamber and parlour, I found it to be twelve feet by ten; yet, in the&s;e contracted limits were contained, a bed, the tre&s;&s;els for another, a chair, with two large che&s;ts for the king's tobacco, for barley, linen, and
<PB N="87" REF="83">
all the trea&s;ures of the family. The kitchen was nearly of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions: yet in this po&s;ada were 35 hor&s;es, mules, and a&s;&s;es, with their riders and drivers, who all found lodging for the night.</P>
<P>No country can &s;uffer more than Spain for want of a rich tenantry. Excepting a few provinces, the lands are commonly in admini&s;tration; and hence exten&s;ive di&s;tricts yield only a contemptible revenue to their lord; and di&s;tricts that of about &s;ix &s;quare leagues, that once could boa&s;t of more than 100 towns, are now reduced to a tenth part of that number.</P>
<P>Avila is celebrated among the Catholics, as having been the birth-place of <HI>St. Tere&s;a:</HI> in this city are two convents, one built upon the &s;pot where &s;he was born, the other is the one in which &s;he took the veil.</P>
<P>The provinces Bi&s;cay and Navarre, are bounded to the we&s;t by the A&s;turias, to the north by the &s;ea, which is here called the Bay of Bi&s;cay, and to the &s;outh by Old Ca&s;tille. Its extent from north to &s;outh, is about 100 miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about 120. The air here is mild and temperate, as in the other provinces, but the &s;oil uneven and &s;tony. Bi&s;cay, which joins the Pyrenees, &s;eems to be an exten&s;ive continuation of the&s;e mountains to
<PB N="88" REF="84">
the borders of Ca&s;tille; notwith&s;tanding its being very mountainous, few parts of Spain, or indeed of any part of Europe, are &s;o well inhabited as this province, and Navarre. Hou&s;es and cottages may be di&s;cerned in great numbers on the highe&s;t moun|tains, and in many of the vallies, the villages and hamlets are within &s;ight of each other. Many of the hills produce a light &s;ort of wine, partaking of the qualities of champagne, and which, if tran&s;ported to England, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> would be liked equally well. It is plea&s;ing in many parts of Bi&s;cay, to &s;ee vineyards and corn fields hanging reciprocally over each other on the &s;loping &s;ides of the mountains. For 30 leagues, the di&s;tance be|tween the Beda&s;&s;oa which divides the Frontiers from France, and Vittoria, not a quarter of an hour pa&s;&s;es, but the traveller di&s;covers &s;ome village or hamlet.</P>
<P>The tops of all the&s;e mountains, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are crowded with fore&s;ts, or covered with pa&s;tures; the acclivities cultivated as far as their nature will allow, and the deep vallies thronged with villages, hamlets, iron-works, orchards, and gardens. The timber of the mountains, and the iron melted in the forges, employ a great number of hands, and give life and &s;pirit to the whole province. The little towns are full of good hou&s;es, built by tho&s;e who&s;e indu&s;try and enterprizes have been rewarded
<PB N="89" REF="85">
with &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e manufactories and undertak|ings diffu&s;e opulence among the middle cla&s;s of men, and enable them to indulge the patriotic va|nity of &s;ettling comfortably in their native ham|lets.</P>
<P>Bi&s;cay is the country of the ancient Cantabri, &s;o imperfectly &s;ubdued by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and &s;o &s;lightly an|nexed to the Roman empire. Their mountains have in all ages afforded them temptations and op|portunities of withdrawing them&s;elves from every yoke that has been attempted to be impo&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides corn and wine, the Bi&s;cayans rai&s;e a great deal of very fine flax. The &s;ea-coa&s;t abounds &s;o with oranges and lemons, that they are &s;old ex|tremely cheap. Fruit is plentiful throughout the province, the upper parts of the mountains being well wooded; and every one being at liberty to go and cut down as much timber as he thinks proper; but that it may not become &s;carce, they have a cu&s;tom once a year for all the inhabitants to go into the woods, from which they have cut down any timber, and then each man plants two young trees, which he brings from the nur&s;ery in his garden. When the trees are all planted, they dance jovially round a large ca&s;k of wine, which, after having emptied, they &s;eparate and return to their re&s;pec|tive
<PB N="90" REF="86">
habitations. The per&s;on who in&s;tituted this cu&s;tom, has certainly been a great benefactor to his country. The lo&s;tie&s;t and wilde&s;t parts of the mountains abound with the be&s;t &s;ort of Spani&s;h che&s;nuts.</P>
<P>The &s;ea yields plenty of all kinds of fi&s;h, and at Bilboa they have a kind called angullas, which are reckoned a mo&s;t choice dainty. This fi&s;h is as white as milk, and &s;o very &s;mall, that a per&s;on may put two or three dozen of them in his mouth at once. The Bi&s;cayans fry them in oil, and &s;queeze the juice of lemon over them, when they eat them, They are &s;o plentiful, that the poore&s;t people may purcha&s;e them. Boats are ea&s;ily loaded with them by the fi&s;hermen, all along the river Orduna, below Bilboa, down to the &s;ea, which is at the di&s;tance of four or five miles.</P>
<P>The principal rivers are the Beda&s;&s;oa, and the Nervio, which falls into the &s;ea two miles below Bilboa. The ancients called this latter river Cha|lybs, and its water is excellent for tempering &s;teel. The greate&s;t riches in this province, lie in the bo&s;om of the earth, in the iron mines, from which are made large quantities of arms, particularly &s;word-blades, e&s;teemed the be&s;t in Europe; a great deal of iron is likewi&s;e exported in bars. Here are al&s;o mines of lead, and other more valuable metals,
<PB N="91" REF="87">
with which, and the other productions of the coun|try, they carry on a con&s;iderable trade with Hol|land, France, and England.</P>
<P>Bilboa, the capital of the province, lies in a plain, environed by high mountains. This city is plea|&s;antly &s;ituated, enjoys a good air, &s;tands in a fruit|ful country, is well built, and carries on a very con|&s;iderable traffic in iron, wool, &s;affron, and che&s;nuts. It is &s;aid to contain about 20,000 inhabitants. The merchants here are reputed to be very rich. The tide comes clo&s;e to the town, and the harbour is one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t frequented on the north|ern coa&s;ts of Spain.</P>
<P>There are two other &s;ea-ports in this province, <HI>S. Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> which merit the tra|vellers attention; the former plea&s;antly &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, on the Bay of Bi&s;cay, about four or five leagues to the we&s;t of the French fron|tiers. The harbour is large and &s;afe, and the town fortified, but appears to be a place of le&s;s &s;trength than the Spaniards imagined, having been taken from them after a month's &s;iege by the French, in 1719. The &s;treets are long and &s;pacious, and the hou&s;es well built. Their trade is very flouri&s;hing, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in iron and &s;teel, &s;aid to be the fine&s;t in Europe. There is al&s;o a great deal of fine wool exported from hence, the growth of Old Ca&s;|tille.

Some Spani&s;h men of war lie about a quarter of a league to the ea&s;tward of this place at Port-Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Fontarabia is the la&s;t town in Spain, on the &s;ide of France. It is &s;ituated on a penin&s;ula in the Bay if Bi&s;cay, near the mouth of the river Bida&s;&s;oa, which &s;eparates the two kingdoms. It was for|merly looked upon as impregnable by the Spaniards, but was taken by the French after a &s;hort &s;iege, in the &s;ame year that <HI>S. Seba&s;tian</HI> was taken. This is the only town honoured with the title of a city, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop in this divi&s;ion of the province, Bi&s;cay being divided into three divi&s;ions, and it is generally con&s;idered to be the key of Spain on that &s;ide of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Vittoria, or Victoria, the capital of another di|vi&s;ion of this province, is mo&s;t delightfully &s;ituated in a fine valley, about 14 leagues &s;outh of Bilboa. What renders this town very attracting to the eye of a &s;tranger, is the trees planted in all the prin|cipal &s;treets. It is chiefly inhabited by merchants and per&s;ons of rank, who have been drawn hither by the beauty of the town, and its delightful &s;itua|tion. It is &s;aid to have been built by <HI>Sancho,</HI> King of Navarre, in memory of his victory over the Moors of Alava, from which circum&s;tance it was named Victoria.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="89">The three provinces of Bi&s;cay, are the a&s;ylum of liberty and indu&s;try, and this is the great cau&s;e of their common pro&s;perity. In cro&s;&s;ing Bi&s;cay, we perceive their pre&s;ence has given animation to every object; nothing can be more delightful than the hills; nothing can be more chearful than the cultivated vallies. What a difference (&s;ays <HI>Bour|goanne</HI>) in the a&s;pect of this country, and that of the neighbouring province! I am far from wi&s;hing to throw ridicule on the Ca&s;tillians, who&s;e virtues I e&s;teem; but they are &s;ilent and melancholy, they bear in their au&s;tere and &s;allow vi&s;ages, the marks of la&s;&s;itude and poverty. The Bi&s;cayans have a different complexion, and quite another air of countenance and character. Free, lively, and ho&s;|pitable; they &s;eem to enjoy their happine&s;s, and wi&s;h to communicate it to tho&s;e who come among them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bi&s;cayans, who are &s;o different in their language and appearance from the Ca&s;tillians, are not le&s;s &s;o in the con&s;titution of their country. Their province is con&s;idered, in many re&s;pects, as beyond the Spani&s;h frontiers. Except a few re|&s;trictions, all merchandize enters, and is never ex|amined, but at the interior limits. The province has other privileges, of which the people are very jealous, but &s;o precarious a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is liberty, that the&s;e have recently been more than once

attacked. The mo&s;t moderate government, &s;uffers with regret, the &s;hackles with which liberty con|fines its authority. If the king be in want of a certain number of &s;oldiers or &s;ailors, he notifies his wi&s;hes to the province, and the people find the mo&s;t ea&s;y means of furni&s;hing their contingency. The taxes which they pay, have the name and form of free gifts. The monarch, by his mini&s;ter of fi|nances, requires a certain &s;um; the demand is di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed by the &s;tates, and, as it may be imagined, is always acquie&s;ced in. They then levy the &s;um upon the different cities and communities. There is one advantage derived from this mode of levying; the impo&s;t being paid from the city grants, indi|viduals are not expo&s;ed to &s;eizure or con&s;traint. It therefore &s;eems in the fir&s;t point of view, that Bi&s;cay taxes it&s;elf; and for want of the reality, the inhabitants cheri&s;h the &s;hadow; to which, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, they have made real &s;acrifices. The free commerce of Spani&s;h America, might be extended to their ports, if the Bi&s;cayans would allow the nece&s;&s;ary duties to be there paid; but they look upon cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers as the crea|tures of de&s;poti&s;m, and their jealou&s;y rejects the proffered benefits of their &s;overeign. They can therefore make no commercial expedition to Ame|rica, without preparing for it in a neighbouring port, and the mo&s;t indu&s;trious people of Spain, the mo&s;t experienced in navigation, and the be&s;t &s;itu|ated
<PB N="95" REF="91">
for &s;uch a commerce, &s;acrifice a part of the&s;e advantages to that of pre&s;erving &s;ome &s;mall re|mains of liberty. Thus before the war, which gave independence to Briti&s;h America, all the inhabitants of one of the provinces engaged them|&s;elves, by an oath, not to eat lamb, in order to in|crea&s;e the growth of wool, with the intention of rendering u&s;ele&s;s the manufactures of the mother country.</P>
<P>Bi&s;cay is remarkable for its roads, cultivation, and privileges, but more particularly for the in|du&s;try of its inhabitants. This is chiefly exerci&s;ed upon iron, the principal production of the pro|vince. In order to improve this manufacture, the Bi&s;cayans have recour&s;e to foreign corre&s;pondence, public lectures, and travelling. At Bergara, there is a patriotic &s;chool, in which metallurgy is taught by &s;ome able profe&s;&s;ors. They have already &s;ent &s;tudents into Sweden and Germany, where they have acquired &s;uch knowledge in the mines, and in the &s;hops of the manufactures, as has been very u&s;eful to their country. The inhabitants, &s;eparated by their &s;ituation, language, and privileges, weak as they are, and confined within narrow limits, are called by nature and policy to feel the &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m, and are obedient to the call. This noble &s;entiment produced the &s;chool of Bergara, where the nobility of the country are brought up, at the
<PB N="96" REF="92">
expence of the &s;tates; and the &s;ame &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m has lately given new employment to the indu&s;try of the Bi&s;cayans, by digging the port of Deva.</P>
<P>Their privileges, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> are very ex|ten&s;ive, and they watch over them with a jealous eye. They have no bi&s;hops in the province, and &s;tyle the King only Lord of Bi&s;cay. In the year 1477, when <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Ca&s;tille, entered Bi&s;cay with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pampeluna</HI> in his &s;uite, the people ro&s;e in a tumultuous manner, and re|pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, that it was contrary to their laws and con&s;titution, to admit a bi&s;hop into their province, and the King was obliged to &s;end him back; they even went &s;o far as to dig up the earth the holy man had trod upon, and burnt it.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;cayans are &s;tout, brave, and choleric, to a proverb. The be&s;t &s;ailors in Spain belong to the ports of Bi&s;cay, and its mountains produce a very valuable race of &s;oldiers. The men are well-built and active, like all mountaineers. "The people of Bi&s;cay and Navarre (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) are in general as well-limbed as any of the petty nations living on the Apennines; yet in no part of the&s;e mountains are there &s;o many hand&s;ome women as in Bi&s;cay: almo&s;t every <HI>po&s;ada</HI> here offers at lea&s;t one beautiful face.
<PB N="97" REF="93">
The &s;ex, however, of this province, have the repu|tation of being the mo&s;t arrant coquettes. Be&s;ides my own ob&s;ervations, I have been told by Bi&s;cayans, them&s;elves, in the jollity of conver&s;ation, that al|mo&s;t the women will ogle, and whi&s;per, and &s;mile, and flatter, and &s;queeze your hand, to draw pre&s;ents from you, if po&s;&s;ible, without intending to make the lea&s;t return.</P>
<P>Many of the Bi&s;cayan women, of the lower cla&s;s, while very young, go to &s;ervice in the neighbouring provinces, where their neatne&s;s, and &s;implicity of their general dre&s;s, particularly of their head-dre&s;s, renders them di&s;tingui&s;hable at the fir&s;t glance. Numbers of them are to be met with at Bayonne, and in the <HI>Pays de Bigorre.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity that the&s;e females are under of learning more than one lan|guage, is far from impairing their beauty, as no new language can be learned without acquiring new ideas; and the more ideas a woman has the more agreeable &s;he will be. But the Bi&s;cayans turn all their talents, as well natural as acquired, to no other vices but coquetry; and the more agreeable they know them&s;elves to be, the more they expect from every man who covets their acquaintance; ever al|luring, ever kindling hope, and for ever di&s;appoint|ing.</P>
<P>It is a general cu&s;tom in the &s;outhern provinces
<PB N="98" REF="94">
of France, to employ female &s;ervants in the inns, as well as in private hou&s;es, and this draws a great number of young women from Bi&s;cay into the dif|ferent parts of Ga&s;cony and Guienne, where they are certain of being preferred to the natives. The <HI>filles Ga&s;connes</HI> are in general &s;hort and clum&s;y, with broad, tawny, and unmeaning faces; but the <HI>filles Ba&s;quoi&s;es,</HI> or Bi&s;cayan girls, are almo&s;t all of a good &s;ize, and well-&s;haped, with lively black eyes, fair complexions, and a &s;martne&s;s about them, very attracting. Then, the manners of the <HI>Ga&s;connes</HI> are coar&s;e and vulgar, and they do not &s;cruple to throw them&s;elves into the power of every one who will give them the &s;malle&s;t trifle; but the <HI>Ba&s;quires</HI> are &s;hy and artful, and will go no farther than wheed|ling and cajoling, &s;eeking only to &s;crape together a few hundred livres, that they may return to their own country and marry.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the men, it is &s;aid in Spain, that they will rather &s;teal than beg; not as being re|markable for thieving, but that they &s;corn begging. They have a tradition in Bi&s;cay, that one of their kings declared them all <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> and this is the rea&s;on that they will not degrade them&s;elves by a&s;k|ing alms. It is &s;aid there are more natives of Bi&s;cay than of any other province at Madrid, and that no Bi&s;cayan goes there who is not certain to find employment. This is owing to a prevailing opinion
<PB N="99" REF="95">
that the Bi&s;cayans are more active and intelligent than the re&s;t of the Spaniards: be&s;ides, like the Scotch in England, and the Savoyards in France, they &s;tand by each other, and promote the intere&s;t of their courtrymen more &s;edulou&s;ly than is practi&s;ed by the inhabitants of the other provinces in Spain. In one re&s;pect, however, they differ from the Scotch, and the Savoyards; for as &s;oon as they have acquired a little property at Madrid, they retire to their own dear mountains, where they build them&s;elves comfortable habitations, and live the remainder of their days in ea&s;e and comfort; but the Savoyards, when once &s;ettled in France, think no more of the we&s;tern &s;ide of Mount Cenis, except they be porters, chimney-&s;weepers, and marmote-&s;hewers. Nor is the ca&s;e much different with the Scotch, who, when they have once got a footing in any other country, e&s;pecially in England, will &s;ubmit to any thing, rather than return back to their own country.</P>
<P>This continual return of the Bi&s;cayans to the place of their nativity, is the rea&s;on that one &s;ees, even on the highe&s;t mountains, &s;o many hou&s;es well-built, with panes of gla&s;s to the windows, and neat window-&s;hutters, painted yellow or green; a &s;ight which does not occur in the other provinces of Spain.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="96">"The mo&s;t &s;ingular thing in their dre&s;s (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) is the coverings of their legs; they wrap a piece of coar&s;e grey or black woollen cloth round them, and fa&s;ten it with many turns of tape; it an|&s;wers preci&s;ely to the idea I have of <HI>Malvolio's</HI> cro&s;s-gartering in the Twelfth-night. The garb of the women, who are beautiful as angels, tall, light, and merry, is neat and pa&s;toral; their hair falls in long plaits down their backs; and a veil or handkerchief twi&s;ted round in a coquetti&s;h manner, &s;erves them for a very becoming head-dre&s;s; on Sundays they generally wear white, tied with ro&s;e-coloured knots.</P>
<P>Their language is called aboriginal, being un|mixed with either Latin, French, or Spani&s;h. It is &s;o totally different from the Ca&s;tillian, that &s;carce any of the pea&s;ants are to be met who under&s;tand one word of Spani&s;h.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Navarre, which, by way of di&s;|tinction from Lower Navarre, belonging to the French, is called Upper Navarre, borders to the we&s;t on Old Ca&s;tille and Bi&s;cay; and to the &s;outh on Arragon; to the ea&s;t it is bounded by Arragon and the Pyrennees, which divide it from the French Na|varre; and al&s;o by the &s;ame mountains towards the north. Its extent, from north to &s;outh, is about 80 miles, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t is &s;omething more than

70. The name of this province is modern, being entirely unknown to the ancients. It is watered by three rivers, all falling into the Ebro. Here are two main roads, leading over the Pyrenean moun|tains into France; the one from Pampaluna, along the valley of Batan, to Bayonne; the other that of Roncevaux which is the be&s;t, from Pampeluna, by the way of Taraffa, to S. Jean de Port.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of this province, lying among the Pyrenean mountains, its chief wealth con&s;i&s;ts in graziery. The mountains abound in game of all kinds, as boars, &s;tags, roe-bucks, wild-fowls, &amp;c. The mo&s;t remarkable of its vallies are Roncal or Roncevaux, where <HI>Charles the Great</HI> lo&s;t a battle again&s;t the Spaniards. The King of Spain receives no revenue from this country, all the impo&s;ts and duties being, by compact, to be employed in the &s;ervices. Navarre, from the year 718 to 1512, had its peculiar kings, of different families; but in the la&s;t mentioned year was reduced by <HI>Ferdinand the Catholic,</HI> under the frivolous pretence that its mo|narch had been declared an enemy to the church, and excommunicated by the Pope.</P>
<P>Pampeluna is the town of mo&s;t note, and capital of the province. It is &s;ituated in a plain, near the Pyrenees, on the river Arga, about ten leagues to the South of Fontarabia. This city was formerly called
<PB N="102" REF="99">
<HI>Pompeiopolis,</HI> as having been built by <HI>Pompey.</HI> It is a large city, &s;urrounded by a wall, and defended by two ca&s;tles, one within the city, and the other without. The fortifications of the city are incon&s;i|derable, but the ca&s;tle without is &s;ituated on a high rock, and well fortified. Pampeluna is at pre&s;ent a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and the re&s;idence of the Viceroy. It contains, likewi&s;e a univer&s;ity, founded in 1608. What is more remarkable in this &s;pacious town is, a &s;pacious &s;quare, in which the bull-fights are held.</P>
<P>There are two other towns in this province, Ollita and Taffala, in both of which are palaces belonging to the ancient kings of Navarre. They are hand|&s;ome towns, well fortified, and &s;ituated in fine val|lies. The latter contains likewi&s;e a univer&s;ity. The city of Tudala, on the river Ebro, is, from its delightful &s;ituation, the re&s;idence of many per&s;ons of quality.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> A&s;turias and Gallicia.</HEAD>
<P>THE principality of the A&s;turias borders to the we&s;t on Gallicia, to the north on the &s;ea, to the ea&s;t on Bi&s;cay, and to the &s;outh on Old Ca&s;tille. Its ex|tent, from north to &s;outh, is about 18 leagues, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t about 45. It is &s;aid to take its name from the river A&s;ta or A&s;tura. The air of this province is much colder than any other part of Spain, occa&s;ioned by its high mountains and north|erly &s;ituation. Towards the &s;outh it is &s;eparated from Leon and Old Ca&s;tille by high mountains, covered with woods, &s;o that the country is thinly peopled; yet the &s;oil produces a great deal of grain, plenty of fruit, and excellent wine. Its hor&s;es were, of old, famous, and much &s;ought after, on account of their &s;pirit and goodne&s;s. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;tronge&s;t and &s;wifte&s;t in Spain. This coun|try, being naturally defended by high mountains, held out for a long time again&s;t the Romans, and was never entirely conquered by the Moors.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="101">The nobility of this province value them|&s;elves on their de&s;cent from the old Goths, and on their blood not being adulterated either with the Moors or the Jews. For after the unfortunate battle which <HI>Roderic,</HI> King of the Goths, fought with the Moors, near Xeres, the Gothic prince re|treated, with a con&s;iderable number of his nobility, into the mountains of A&s;turias, and there collected a &s;mall army; but finding him&s;elf unable to face the enemy in the field, he betook him&s;elf, with 1000 brave Goths, retired into a large cave in the mount|ains of Au&s;ena, and, on the approach of the Moors, &s;allied forth, and finally routed them. This de|feat, and bold &s;tand made by the Goths is, to this day, &s;o celebrated in Spain, that all the inhabitants of this mountain are looked upon as true Goths, and enjoy particular privileges; and, though they are but pea&s;ants, and go in great numbers from this mountain into the other provinces of Spain to find work, yet they di&s;dain to be called by any other title than that of Goths. Both great and &s;mall give them&s;elves the appellation of <HI>Illu&s;tre Goths,</HI> or <HI>Illu&s;|tres Montagnes;</HI> and, amid&s;t their poverty, look up|on it as ignominious, to intermarry with great and rich families of any other race. They are likewi&s;e &s;o much e&s;teemed, that other families frequently give con&s;iderable &s;ums to many among&s;t them, but the greate&s;t honour of this di&s;trict ari&s;es from its belonging to the hereditary Prince of Spain, who

<P>Oviedo, anciently <HI>Brigetum,</HI> the capital of all A&s;turia, and the only place which bears the name of <HI>Civdad,</HI> is &s;eated on a plain, in a kind of elevation, between the little rivers Ove and Deva; the fir&s;t of which has given the name of Ovetum to the city, from whence comes Ovedo. The town is well-built, but not con&s;iderable either for its trade or its riches. Its population is e&s;timated at between 7 and 8,000 inhabitants. The cathedral boa&s;ts a va&s;t number of relics, which were brought hither from all parts of Spain, by way of &s;ecuring them again&s;t the Moors. The hou&s;es about the church of <HI>S.

<P>This town, like mo&s;t other large cities in Spain, contains an <HI>ho&s;picio,</HI> or general workhou&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this refuge for the poor, and for their children, the Bi&s;hop cau&s;es money to be di&s;tributed every morning at his gates. In addition to all this, the canons &s;catter plentifully their alms as they walk
<PB N="106" REF="103">
the &s;treets; and the convents admini&s;ter daily bread and broth to tho&s;e who will apply. When &s;ick, the poor have, be&s;ides, a commodious ho&s;pital ready to receive them.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all that has been done, (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) beggars cloathed in rags, and covered with vermin, &s;warm in every &s;treet." Is it not therefore evident they have done too much, increa&s;ing both the numbers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, by the very means which have been employed to relieve their wants.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the &s;implicity of manners in this di&s;tant province. Poli&s;hed nations would be offended at the freedom with which they &s;peak of things, which, in the more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety mu&s;t not even be hinted at; yet &s;uch language nei|ther gives di&s;gu&s;t nor tends to excite the pa&s;&s;ions. On the other hand, familiarities, &s;uch as in other countries would be e&s;teemed innocent, are here highly of|fen&s;ive.</P>
<P>They wear no paint, no powder, no curls, nor any cap, they have nothing but a bit of ribbon bound round the head. In this &s;implicity of dre&s;s youth and beauty enjoy their triumph; but old wo|men, for want of borrowed charms, have nothing which can plea&s;e the eye. They meet with atten|tion
<PB N="107" REF="104">
however from the gentlemen, nor do they ap|pear in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e attentions.</P>
<P>In this province oxen &s;upply the place of hor&s;es, and con&s;equently beef is cheap. No di&s;tinction in price is made between the prime and the coar&s;e pieces, nor between fat meat and lean, becau&s;e the prices are fixed by the magi&s;trate, without re&s;pect to quality. The con&s;equence is, that the meat is never &s;o good as it would be, were the market free. Beef, in this province, is under three-halfpence, mutton &s;omething more than two-pence per lb. and bread is little more than a penny for the pound.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance between the A&s;turias and many parts of England is very &s;triking. The a&s;pect of the country is the &s;ame, as to verdure, inclo&s;ures, live hedges, and woods; there is a &s;imilar mixture of woodlands, arable, and rich pa&s;tures; there are the &s;ame kind of trees, crops, fruit and cattle.</P>
<P>Both &s;uffer by humidity in winter, and both en|joy a temperate climate, with this difference, that with re&s;pect to humidity and heat, the &s;cale prepon|derates on the &s;ide of the A&s;turias. The atmo&s;phere of this province is at times &s;o charged with vapour, that for many months together they &s;eldom &s;ee the &s;un. This happens generally in the &s;pring months, May, June, and July; but then, to balance this,
<PB N="108" REF="105">
in Augu&s;t and September, they as &s;eldom &s;ee a cloud.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the relaxing humidity of the climate, the common food of the inhabitants contributes much to the prevalence of the many di&s;ea&s;es which infe&s;t this country. They eat little fle&s;h, they drink little wine. Their u&s;ual diet is India corn, with beans, peas, che&s;nuts, apples, pears, melons and cucum|bers; and even their bread, made of Indian corn, has neither barm nor leaven, but is unfermented. Their common drink is water.</P>
<P>Agues, fevers, and even pleuri&s;ies, often terminate here in &s;cabies, and this frequently gives place to them, returning however when the fever cea&s;es. In adults it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hands and arms, with the legs and thighs; covering them with a filthy cru&s;t. In wet weather the itching be|comes more trouble&s;ome, and towards midnight is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>There are no fewer than 20 ho&s;pitals in the A&s;tu|rias for the lepro&s;y. It appears in different forms. Some patients are covered over with a white dry &s;curf, and look like millers; in others the &s;kin is al|mo&s;t black, full of wrinkles, and covered with a loath&s;ome cru&s;t; others have one leg and thigh enormou&s;ly &s;welled, and full of ulcers, &s;ending
<PB N="109" REF="106">
forth a mo&s;t abominable &s;mell. Some patients, in|&s;tead of the great leg, have a mo&s;t enormous &s;welling of one hand, or el&s;e have the features of the face &s;woln to &s;uch a degree as &s;carce to retain the human form; others again have carbuncles, big as hazle nuts, all over the &s;urface of their body.</P>
<P>Although &s;ubject to &s;uch a variety of di&s;ea&s;es, there are few countries which can produce more ex|amples of longevity. Many of the inhabitants live to the age of 100, &s;ome of them to 110, and others &s;till longer. If we con&s;ider the temperature of the climate, ari&s;ing from its humidity, together with the cooling winds from the Atlantic, and from the &s;nowy mountains, we mu&s;t naturally expect to find in&s;tances of advanced age, with the prevalence of chronical complaints, and of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as are &s;eldom mortal: in warmer and in drier climates nature comes &s;ooner to maturity, is &s;ubject to more acute di&s;ea&s;es; and like combu&s;tibles, when burning with a vivid flame, is rapidly con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of people of fa&s;hion in this country are generally built round a court, with corridors; &s;omething like many of our great old fa&s;hioned inns.</P>
<P>The ground-floor is generally occupied wholly by &s;ervants, except one corner, which is made u&s;e of
<PB N="110" REF="107">
as a chapel. The bed-chambers contain, &s;ome two, &s;ome three, and others four beds; for in Spain, even in re&s;pectable families, &s;everal gentlemen will occupy one chamber.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom reconciles them to this, and by the prac|tice of Scotland, France, and Spain, we may &s;ee clearly that other nations can &s;ubmit to that which is mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting to an Engli&s;hman; and we may further ob&s;erve, even in our own cottages, that the olfactory nerves may be reduced to &s;uch a degree of torpid in&s;en&s;ibility, as to be happy and contented in the mid&s;t of filth and na&s;tine&s;s.</P>
<P>The walls are white-limed, and the floors &s;moothed with the adze, but none of them are ever planed, nor have the chambers any ceilings to them. The beds likewi&s;e have no curtains. They have large halls in their hou&s;es, re&s;embling tho&s;e in our old Engli&s;h man&s;ions; and the &s;tile of living re&s;embles the old Briti&s;h ho&s;pitality; the long oak table, &s;urrounded by &s;trong oak benches, being every day very plentifully covered.</P>
<P>Agriculture is at a very low ebb in this province; nor are the implements made u&s;e of for the purpo&s;es of agriculture worthy of imitation. The cart-wheel has no &s;pokes, but con&s;i&s;ts of a wooden ring, com|po&s;ed of four quadrants, bi&s;ected by a plank, of
<PB N="111" REF="108">
from eight to ten inches wide, which receives the axle-tree, and, being fa&s;tened to the wheel turns, round with it. The farmers, not &s;atisfied with the friction ari&s;ing from a wooden axle-tree, of eight inches diameter, revolving without grea&s;e, &s;ix two wooden pins, which confine it in its place, &s;o near together, that they bind hard again&s;t it; and this they do for the &s;ake of the noi&s;e ari&s;ing from the friction, and which is con&s;idered as exciting the oxen to labour, and thereby precluding the nece&s;&s;ity of either &s;peaking to them, or pricking them with goads. This mu&s;ic, which re&s;embles the &s;ound of a po&s;tboys's horn, is heard from morning to night, in every part of the A&s;turias, and at a di&s;tance is not unplea&s;ant even to a &s;tranger; but to the pea|&s;ant, is the never-failing &s;ource of calm enjoy|ments.</P>
<P>The province of Gallicia, which was formerly a kingdom, is bounded on the &s;outh by Portugal, on the north and we&s;t by the &s;ea, being joined to the ea&s;t by A&s;turia and Leon. It receives its name from the ancient Gallazi, the mo&s;t powerful and numerous of the &s;everal nations who inhabited it. Its extent from north and &s;outh is nearly 40 leagues; and almo&s;t as many in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This is the mo&s;t maritime of all the Spani&s;h provinces, and enjoys accordingly the greate&s;t number of &s;ea-ports, among&s;t which Corunna and Ferrol, are the
<PB N="112" REF="109">
mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Cape Fini&s;terre, one of its pro|montories, the <HI>Promontorium Artabrum &amp; Celticum</HI> of the ancients, lies towards the we&s;t, and is well-known to all navigators. The coa&s;t enjoys a temperate air, but in the inland parts it is &s;ome|what colder and very damp. This country is &s;o mountainous as to admit of few levels, and, the &s;ea-coa&s;t excepted, is but thinly inhabited in re&s;pect of the other provinces. It has no le&s;s than 70 rivers and &s;maller &s;treams, the principal of which is the Minho.</P>
<P>This province produces little corn, but makes up for that deficiency in wine, flax, and lemons. It has al&s;o very fine pa&s;tures. The &s;ea abounds in excel|lent fi&s;h, particularly &s;ardines and &s;almon, and a particular kind, called bezugos. Its fore&s;ts al&s;o af|ford good &s;hip-timber. The univer&s;al poverty of the inhabitants obliges great number of them to &s;eek a living in the neighbouring provinces, where they let them&s;elves out to the mo&s;t &s;ervile and laborious employments. For this humble indu&s;try they are de&s;pi&s;ed by the other Spaniards.</P>
<P>Gallicia was rai&s;ed to a monarchy in the year 1060, by <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Ca&s;tille and Leon; and <HI>Fer|dinand the Catholic,</HI> quelled the mutinous temper of the Gallicians, particularly of the nobility, who, for a long time, had been wanting in due regard to
<PB N="113" REF="110">
the King's Governor. This province contains 64 cities and towns, but few of the latter are any ways con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>St. Jago de Compo&s;tella, the capital of Gallicia, is &s;ituated in a fine plain, &s;urrounded with little ri&s;ing hills, and watered with a great many &s;mall &s;treams. It lies 30 miles &s;outh of Corunna, and 40 to the ea&s;t of Cape Fini&s;terre. The town con|tains about 2000 hou&s;es. It is a rich, flouri&s;hing city, better accommodated with provi&s;ions and the luxuries of life, than mo&s;t towns in Spain, from its vicinity to the &s;ea. In this town are to be &s;een fine piazzas, with &s;everal mona&s;teries of both &s;exes, and beautiful churches, among&s;t which the cathedral is particularly worthy of notice, as in it is kept the pretended body of the Apo&s;tle <HI>James the younger,</HI> the titular &s;aint and patron of all Spain, which, towards the clo&s;e of the ninth century, they af|firm to have been di&s;covered by a divine revelation. The rage for pilgrimage is much abated; but there are people living, who remember when it was the fa&s;hion for all young men of &s;pirit, both in Italy and France, before they married, to go as pilgrims to St. Jago; and even now it is not uncommon to &s;ee &s;ome few old men, and many companies of young ones, come to this place, on a pilgrimage, from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of Europe. The &s;ee of the archbi&s;hop is one of the riche&s;t in Spain, having
<PB N="114" REF="111">
a revenue of 70,000 crowns <HI>per annum,</HI> and the chap|ter as much more.</P>
<P>It was from this city that the military order of <HI>St. James</HI> had its origin, in 1170, under the reign of <HI>Ferdinand II.</HI> King of Leon. The knights wear a medal, upon which there is a red &s;word, at the button-hole of their coats. This order has 87 commanderies in the kingdoms of Ca&s;tille and Le|on, which annually produce 2,72,000 ducats.</P>
<P>About 14 leagues &s;outh-ea&s;t of Compo&s;tella, lies Oren&s;e, famous for its mineral baths. Some are only of &s;uch a moderate heat that per&s;ons may bathe in them, and others are &s;o very hot that eggs may be dre&s;&s;ed in them; but they are all very much re&s;orted to, and are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s great vir|tue in the removal of different di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e baths appear to have been known in the time of the Romans, and had the appellation of <HI>aquae ca|lidae.</HI> The town is &s;ituated at the foot of a mountain, on the river Minho; and, what is very remarkable, in that part which lies near the mountain, the air is extremely cold, and the win|ter of great length; whil&s;t the other, which lies on the &s;ide of the plain, enjoys all the plea&s;ures of the &s;pring, and the autumnal fruits, on ac|count of the &s;prings, which warm the air with their exhalations. On the out&s;ide of one of the
<PB N="115" REF="112">
gates is a noble arch, &s;o very lofty that a man of war might pa&s;s under it, with all its &s;ails &s;tand|ing. The fields, in the environs of this town, are very rural, and well cultivated, and, among other delicious fruits, produce grapes that make mo&s;t de|licious wine.</P>
<P>The manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants of this province appear to differ very little from tho&s;e in the adjoining province, which we have already de&s;cribed. "The inhabitant of Gallicio (&s;ays <HI>Peyron</HI>) may be compared to the native of Au|vergne; he quits his country, and is employed in the re&s;t of Spain, much in the &s;ame manner as per&s;ons of the &s;ame cla&s;s, from Auvergne and Li|mo&s;in are in France; that is, in &s;weeping chimnies, cleaning &s;hoes, &amp;c."</P>
<P>The climate appears, likewi&s;e, to re&s;emble that of the A&s;turias, being very humid; nor are in|&s;tances of longevity wanting in this province. The curate of the pari&s;h of <HI>S. Juan de Poyo,</HI> A. D. 1724, is &s;aid to have admini&s;tered the &s;acrament to 13 per&s;ons, who&s;e ages, together, made 1499, the younge&s;t of them being 110, and the olde&s;t 127. But, in Villa de Fosfinares, one <HI>Juan de Outeyro</HI> a poor labourer, died in the year 1726, aged more than 146 years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Kingdoms of Murcia and Granada.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now traver&s;ed the provinces on the northern coa&s;t of Spain, we &s;hall proceed to tho&s;e which lie on the Mediterranean, beginning fir&s;t with the kingdom of Murcia, in which is &s;ituated Carthagena, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the &s;ea-ports.</P>
<P>This kingdom is the lea&s;t of tho&s;e which com|po&s;e the monarchy of Spain; it is but 25 leagues in length, and about 23 in breadth. Its principal river is the Segura, which receives its &s;ource in New Ca&s;tille, and, after pa&s;&s;ing through this pro|vince and Valencia, falls into the Mediterranean &s;ea. The air is accounted healthy and pure, and the country produces wine and corn, which are both good, but, being mountainous, not in any great quantity, &s;o that its chief commodities are fine fruits, &s;uch as oranges, lemons, &amp;c &s;ugar, honey; &s;ilk, and grain, &s;uch as rice, peas, &amp;c. Its principal produce appears to be &s;ilk. The Moors, when they conquered Spain, are &s;aid to have
<PB N="117" REF="114">
brought thither the mulberry-tree, and to have taught the Spaniards the manner of cultivating it, as al&s;o how to prepare and weave the &s;ilk. The &s;oil of Murcia is &s;o favourable to this tree, that it more ea&s;ily grows there than in any other part of Spain. The little kingdom of Murcia is &s;aid to contain 355,500 mulberry trees, and to produce annually, 250,000 lbs. of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Every kind of fruit produced in Spain is found in Murcia. It &s;upplies Ca&s;tille, England, and France, with oranges, lemons, figs, &amp;c. The mountains are covered with &s;hrubs, reeds, and odoriferous, as well as medicinal, plants. The two principal cities of which we mean to &s;peak, are Murcia and Carthagena.</P>
<P>Murcia. Several volumes (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) have been written upon the antiquities of this city. In the earlie&s;t ages it is &s;aid to have been called Tadmir, that is, productive of palm-trees. But <HI>Ca&s;calis</HI> maintains it never had any other name than that of Murcia. The&s;e di&s;putes are of little con|&s;equence; its antiquity is &s;ufficiently proved by in&s;criptions, &s;ome of which are quoted by <HI>Appian,</HI> in his de&s;cription of Spain; and the re&s;t &s;till remain in Murcia.</P>
<P>In its origin Murcia was, like every other city
<PB N="118" REF="115">
near Carthagena, only a &s;mall village. The latter eclip&s;ed them all till it was conquered by <HI>Scipio.</HI> The Romans no &s;ooner came to the village of Murcia, and ob&s;erved its agreeable &s;ituation, the natural ca&s;cades of the river, and the banks covered with myrtle, (where this &s;hrub &s;till flouri&s;hes more than in any other part of Spain) than they re&s;olved to con&s;ecrate it to their <HI>Venus Myrtia,</HI> who delighted in myrtle, waters, and fountains: they added an <HI>a</HI> only to the name, which was <HI>Murci.</HI></P>
<P>It was in the fields of Murcia that <HI>Scipio,</HI> return|ed from his conque&s;t, celebrated the ob&s;equies of his father and uncle. This celebration con&s;i&s;ted in games and combats of Gladiators, and according to <HI>Livy,</HI> it was not &s;laves, who were forced to combat, but brave champions, who voluntarily en|tered the li&s;ts, to give proofs of their valour. Mur|cia remained 616 years under the dominion of the Romans.</P>
<P>It was then taken, di&s;mantled, and &s;acked, by the Goths, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it 310 years. The Moors, in their turn, came to be&s;iege it, and the inha|bitants went out of the city to give them battle. The two armies met in a field, &s;till called <HI>Sangore|na,</HI> from the bloody battle that en&s;ued, in which the Murcians fought with &s;uch gallantry that mo&s;t of them remained dead upon the field. In this
<PB N="119" REF="116">
extremity the Governor ordered all the women to be clad in armour, and drawn out on the ramparts, whil&s;t, in the character of an amba&s;&s;ador, he went to the Moori&s;h General to capitulate. The Moors, believing the city to be full of &s;oldiers, granted him very advantageous terms; but what was their a&s;toni&s;hment, when, upon entering the gates, they found only an army of women! At length, after 527 years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Moors lo&s;t it, in 1241; and it has, ever &s;ince, remained under the dominion of Spain.</P>
<P>Murcia &s;tands in a plain, which, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is 25 leagues and a half in length. The Se|gura runs by the &s;ide of the city. This river is decorated with a fine &s;tone bridge, and has a magnificent quay.</P>
<P>"I was exceedingly &s;truck (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) with the bridge over the Segura, magnificent in it&s;elf, and delightful for the pro&s;pect it commands of the river, the city, the vale, and the di&s;tant mountains, all in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing points of view."</P>
<P>The entrance to Murcia is by a &s;trait and &s;pacious avenue, well planted, and well water|ed; to the right and to the left of which, the
<PB N="120" REF="117">
water, in abundance produces the mo&s;t luxuriant crops.</P>
<P>This city is divided into 11 pari&s;hes, with a ca|thedral; and contains, by the la&s;t return to govern|ment, 15000 families. There are nine convents for nuns, and ten for friars.</P>
<P>The principal front of the cathedral is beautiful, but overcharged with ornaments. The three prin|cipal doors are of reddi&s;h marble, and of the Co|rinthian order; they are ornamented with 32 &s;tatues, as large as life. The Arabian &s;culpture, which ornaments the pillars, is well executed, and in a good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of the cathedral is &s;pacious. The beauty, lightne&s;s, and elegance of Gothic archi|tecture are found throughout.</P>
<P>The altar of the cathedral is of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, and the &s;teps which lead to it are of the &s;ame metal.</P>
<P>Among the convents, that of the Cordeliers is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed. It has a good library, but badly managed, in which are the portraits of many great men, who have rendered them&s;elves famous by arms, letters, and the art of govern|ment. The Moori&s;h palace &s;tood formerly upon
<PB N="121" REF="118">
the ground on which the canvent of the Domi|nicans is built.</P>
<P>Murcia is &s;urrounded by public walks, which are mo&s;t delightful. This city, although con&s;ider|able, and well peopled, has not one &s;ingle inn; the only lodging to be had in it is as wretched as tho&s;e found upon the great roads in Spain, generally kept by Gitanos, or Gip&s;ies.</P>
<P>The environs of Murcia exceed any thing of the kind to be met with in Spain. The &s;oil is a rich loam, well watered; and the wide expan&s;e ap|pears like a well cultivated garden. Oranges and lemons, olives and mulberries abound; and the whole valley &s;warms with &s;uch multitudes of men, all active and u&s;efully employed, that they re&s;emble bees, when collecting honey, or returning loaded to the hive. Being dre&s;&s;ed in white, they are the more con&s;picuous. They have only a linen wai&s;t|coat, and &s;hort trow&s;ers.</P>
<P>Carthagena is announced at a di&s;tance by vil|lages, farms, country-hou&s;es, and plea&s;ant walks. The principal founders of this city, were <HI>Teucer</HI> and <HI>A&s;drubal;</HI> but a large city called <HI>Conte&s;ta,</HI> from the name of <HI>Te&s;ta,</HI> King of Spain, is &s;aid to have &s;tood upon the &s;ame ground, 1412 years before <HI>Chri&s;t. Teucer</HI> came next, and began to embelli&s;h and for|tify
<PB N="122" REF="119">
this city; at length, <HI>A&s;drubal</HI> finding its &s;itua|tion delightful, added to its magnificence, and made it the rival of Carthage.</P>
<P>Carthagena remained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;cendants of <HI>A&s;drubal,</HI> until the year 208 before <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> when it was conquered by <HI>Publius Scipio,</HI> and <HI>Caius Loelius.</HI> It was then governed by <HI>Mago,</HI> the la&s;t Carthaginian chief. <HI>Livy</HI> tells us, that when <HI>Scipio</HI> arrived in Spain, Carthagena was, after Rome, one of the riche&s;t cities in the world; full of arms, and full of &s;oldiers. Notwith&s;tanding its great re&s;ources, <HI>Scipio</HI> took it, and delivered it up to be pillaged. He brought away with him 64 mi|litary banners, 276 gold cups, and 18,000 marks of &s;ilver, be&s;ides ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame metal; 40,000 mea&s;ures of wheat, and 160,000 mea&s;ures of oats; in a word, he acquired &s;uch immen&s;e trea&s;ures, that the hi&s;torian &s;ays, the city it&s;elf was the lea&s;t the Romans gained by the expedition. <HI>Ut minimum omnium inter tantas opes bellicas Carthago ip&s;a fuerit.</HI></P>
<P>It was after this conque&s;t, that <HI>Scipio</HI> &s;et the great example of temperance and genero&s;ity, &s;o much celebrated in that and the &s;ucceeding ages. A young female captive of noble extraction, who&s;e beauty attracted the eyes and admiration of the whole camp, being brought before him, <HI>Scipio,</HI> when he was informed &s;he had been promi&s;ed in
<PB N="123" REF="120">
marriage by <HI>Lucius,</HI> Prince of the Celtiberians, and that the two lovers had a great affection for each other, &s;ent for the young prince, and not only re|&s;tored him the lady, but forced him to take as a marriage portion, the gold her friends had brought as a ran&s;om; and further offered him at the &s;ame time, the friend&s;hip of the Roman people.</P>
<P>Carthagena was a long time the Indies of the Romans; and there are &s;till &s;ilver mines in the en|virons. The lead mines in the village of Los Alumbres are very rich; amethy&s;ts and precious &s;tones are found in its vicinity; and not far from Hellin, there is a very con&s;iderable mine of &s;ulphur.</P>
<P>The country round Carthagena, was formerly called Campo Spartaio, and the appellation of Spartaria, was al&s;o given to this city, from the great quantities of Spartum, or Spani&s;h broom, found in the plains and the mountains.</P>
<P>Carthagena was totally de&s;troyed in the wars of <HI>Atanagilda,</HI> with <HI>Agila,</HI> King of the Goths in Spain: &s;everal antique &s;tones with in&s;criptions, have been found among the ruins. One of the&s;e is now in a garden, in the town of E&s;pinardo, near Murcia. It has one &s;ide the &s;tern of a &s;hip, and on the other the figure of <HI>Pallas,</HI> holding an olive branch; at
<PB N="124" REF="121">
her feet are the cornucopia, and the caduceus of <HI>Mercury. Ca&s;calis,</HI> for what rea&s;on we know not, attributes this monument to <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and &s;up|po&s;es it to have been erected by him, at the time when he formed the de&s;ign of &s;ubjugating the world and his country.</P>
<P>On the land &s;ide, Carthagena is defended by a mountain, formed by three hills: in the middle of the city is a high hill, with a fort, now almo&s;t in ruins. The harbour is &s;pacious, and &s;o deep, that &s;hips may moor clo&s;e to the land. It is a ba&s;on, hollowed by nature, which &s;eems to have &s;heltered it from the winds by &s;everal hills, placed round it at equal di&s;tances; &s;o that from the mole, nothing but the entrance of the harbour, and the ba&s;on, are to be &s;een. No port in the world can be compared with this, for &s;afety and regularity.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal is very large, and furni&s;hed with every thing that can facilitate the building, and fitting out of a &s;hip. Every requi&s;ite is in &s;uch rea|dine&s;s, that a &s;hip of the line may, in three days, be got ready for &s;ea. At the plea&s;ure of the builder, the water fills the magnificent ba&s;ons, which &s;erve as &s;tocks, and the &s;hip &s;lides of her&s;elf into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Carthagena occupies the declivity of a hill, with
<PB N="125" REF="122">
a little intermediate &s;pace between that and the harbour. The city is protected from the &s;outh and the we&s;t by high mountains and barren rocks; but to the north and the ea&s;t it is open, and com|municates with an exten&s;ive valley.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are wide, and the hou&s;es are commo|dious. They have generally flat roofs, which, in a climate like this, admini&s;ters to the comfort of the inhabitants, affording them a cool retreat, where, after &s;un-&s;et, they may a&s;&s;emble to enjoy the re|fre&s;hing breeze; and the rainy &s;ea&s;on being of &s;hort duration, the&s;e are &s;ufficient to protect the in|terior of their man&s;ions from humidity.</P>
<P>The cathedral, a mi&s;erable pile, is now degraded, and the Bi&s;hop's &s;ee being removed to Murcia, it is become a pari&s;h church. Of the convents, not one is worthy of notice.</P>
<P>There have been here 2,000 criminals, chiefly &s;mugglers, who, being condemned to work in chains, are called <HI>pre&s;idiarios.</HI> They are employed in the mo&s;t &s;ervile labours, &s;ome for five years, others for &s;even; and at the expiration of the&s;e terms, like our convicts upon the Thames, are turned loo&s;e upon the public, not corrected nor trained to in|du&s;try, but vitiated by the &s;ociety of thieves.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="123">In the dock-yard, we omitted to ob&s;erve a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance, viz. that the ma&s;ts and timber are floated in water, without the lea&s;t apprehen|&s;ion of their &s;uffering by the worms; becau&s;e, as they never open their &s;luices, till the water is be|come putrid, the evaporation, proceeding with ra|pidity, leaves a &s;trong brine, in which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble the worm &s;hould live; and in the north of Spain, where the evaporation is not &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, they bury their ma&s;ts in &s;and, and by pins prevent their floating when they are covered by the tide.</P>
<P>In this city are made great quantities of the <HI>e&s;parto</HI> ropes and cables, &s;ome of them &s;pun like hemp, and others platted. The&s;e cables float on the water, and therefore are not liable to be cut by the rocks on a foul coa&s;t. This ru&s;h makes good mats for the pea&s;ants hou&s;es, and of late years, it has been &s;pun into fine thread, for the purpo&s;e of making cloth. We have remarked, that this ru&s;h is the natural and peculiar production of all the high and uncultivated mountains of the &s;outh; and here we cannot help admiring the tran&s;cendant goodne&s;s of Providence, in giving abundantly to man, in the&s;e dry and elevated regions, where neither hemp nor flax will grow, materials proper for his clothing, and the exerci&s;e of his indu&s;try.</P>

<P>Want of fidelity to matrimonial vows, &s;ays the above writer, is equally prevalent at Carthagena, as in the other provinces of Spain.

This he occa&s;ioned him|&s;elf, by going home an hour before his u&s;ual time, to the no &s;mall vexation of his wife and her cortego, who&s;e precipitate retreat, and unexpected arrival in his own hou&s;e, occa&s;ioned the like confu&s;ion there; and thus, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and &s;imilar operations, was literally fulfilled the prediction he made in the morning.</P>
<P>We have already traced this corruption of morals
<PB N="128" REF="125">
to one grand &s;ource, the celibacy of the clergy; in addition to this, we may venture to a&s;&s;ign another cau&s;e, the want of admonition from the pulpit, be|cau&s;e the &s;ecular clergy &s;eldom or ever preach. The monks, indeed, de&s;cant on the virtues of their favourite &s;aint, but they &s;eldom appear &s;olicitous to improve the morals of the people.</P>
<P>Such has been the poverty of Spain, in point of pulpit orators, that they have no author to recom|mend worthy of being noticed; and if a preacher of more than moderate abilities appears, he is ad|mired as a prodigy, and wor&s;hipped as a God.</P>
<P>Such, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> was a famous capuchin, who vi&s;ited Carthagena, during my re&s;idence in that city; and every evening preached in the great &s;quare to more than 10,000 people.

of the ancient Boetica, and was inhabited by the Ba&s;tula Sexitani, &amp;c. Its extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is about 65 leagues, but its breadth varies, being in &s;ome places &s;carce five leagues, and in others at lea&s;t 20.</P>
<P>This province is inter&s;ected in every direction by very lofty mountains, which form delightful vallies.

<P>Whil&s;t this province was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Moors, it was one of the be&s;t cultivated in the world; the number of its inhabitants was immen&s;e, and the vallies and mountains were covered with luxuriant plantations of vines and fruit-trees. Each Moor had his allotment of as much ground as &s;uf|ficed for his habitation, the maintenance of his fa|mily, and the provender for his hor&s;e, which every man was obliged to keep. The&s;e &s;mall freeholds formed the general appearance of the country, be|fore the inroads and ravages of the Chri&s;tians had driven them into cities, mountains difficult of acce&s;s, or quite away to the coa&s;t of Barbary. The &s;ingle city of Granada, contained 80,000 families, and frequently &s;ent out armies of 30,000 infantry, and 10,000 hor&s;e. An Arabian author &s;ays, that the kings had a con&s;tant &s;upply of 100,000 hor&s;es for

their own u&s;e, and for mounting their cavalry in time of war, and more than once had mu&s;tered 200,000 &s;oldiers in actual pay, for the purpo&s;e of making war upon the Ca&s;tillians. But its pre&s;ent &s;tate is widely different. Depopulation is a terrible &s;courge to a country. In many parts of Granada, the lands have no other ornament, than the plants with which nature has covered them. It is &s;till, however, one of the mo&s;t fertile provinces in Spain, and produces wine, oil, hemp, flax, &s;ugar, cinna|mon, oranges, pomegranites, almonds, figs, citrons, lemons, and rai&s;ins, in great abundance. The mul|berry-tree is cultivated here with &s;ucce&s;s, and the filk it produces, is &s;aid to be finer than that of the kingdom of Valencia. Here are al&s;o great quanti|ties of honey and wax. Several towns in the moun|tains near Antequerra, make &s;alt, which the &s;un prepares from water conveyed into pans. Of the galls, which are found in this country in large quan|tities, a dye is made for leather. This province likewi&s;e produces great plenty of dates, from which con&s;iderable advantage is derived, as al&s;o from the acorns, which far exceed the fine&s;t nuts.</P>
<P>This province fir&s;t became a di&s;tinct kingdom in the 13th century, when the Moori&s;h king <HI>Abenhud,</HI> who re&s;ided at Cordova, having in the year 1236, lo&s;t his wife and crown, in a battle again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, his &s;ubjects retired to Granada, and cho&s;e
<PB N="131" REF="130">
a new king, who made that city his capital and place of re&s;idence. This kingdom, which was the la&s;t of the Moori&s;h, contained 32 large towns, and 97 &s;maller, and continued from the year 1236, to 1492, when <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Catholic reduced it, and annexed it to the crown of Ca&s;tille. The princi|pal cities we &s;hall notice, are Granada and Ma|laga.</P>
<P>Granada is &s;aid to have been one of the large&s;t cities in Spain. It is &s;ituated at the foot of the <HI>Sierra Nevada,</HI> or the &s;nowy mountain, and &s;tands upon two hills, &s;eparated by the Darro. The Xenil runs under the walls, and the&s;e two rivers are formed by the melting of the &s;now, with which the mountain is con&s;tantly covered. The Darro is &s;aid to carry with it &s;mall particles of gold, and its name derived from <HI>dat aurum,</HI> may be alledged as a proof. The Xenil, in like manner, rolls with its &s;treams little pieces of &s;ilver. When <HI>Charles V.</HI> came to Granada, in 1526, with the Empre&s;s <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> the city pre&s;ented him with a crown made of gold, ga|thered from the Darro.</P>
<P>Several authors give to Granada the title of il|lu&s;trious and famous, and &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that it is &s;till the greate&s;t city in Spain. The country round it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, but extremely neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="131">The Moors are &s;aid to regret nothing but Gra|nada, of all the lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;tained in Spain. They mention it in all their evening prayers, and &s;upplicate Heaven to re&s;tore it to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The la&s;t Moori&s;h amba&s;&s;ador who came into Spain, obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the King to vi&s;it Granada; and, on entering the Alhambra, or Moori&s;h palace, he &s;hed tears, and could not refrain from exclaim|ing, that the folly of his ance&s;tors had deprived them and their po&s;terity of this delightful country. The date of the foundation of Granada is &s;aid to be 2801 years before Chri&s;t. In the time of the Ro|mans it was a municipal colony.</P>
<P>The Moors have left more monuments in Grana|da than in any other city in Spain. From the great number of in&s;criptions, and the fine edifices of the Alhambra, and the generalif, or hou&s;e of plea&s;ure, it might be imagined the&s;e people intended Granada as the great depo&s;itory of their religion, manners, cu&s;toms, and magnificence. There is not a wall which does not bear &s;ome marks of their power; but, notwith&s;tanding, the reign of the Moors in Spain is buried in confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity. The ignorance of the Spaniards, their &s;uper&s;tition, and hatred of the Moors, have much contributed to this ob&s;curity; they either ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, or &s;uf|fered time to efface every thing bearing the marks of Mahometani&s;m; and it may be &s;aid that chance

<P>The royal palace of the Alhambra, in this city, is one of the mo&s;t entire, as well as the mo&s;t magni|ficent, of any edifices, which the Moors erected in Spain. It was built in 1280, by the &s;econd Moor|i&s;h King of Granada; and, in 1492, in the reign of their eighteenth king, was taken by the Spaniards, under the command of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> as has been al|ready mentioned. It is &s;ituated on a hill, which is a&s;cended on a road, bordered with hedges of impe|rial myrtle, and rows of elms. On this hill, within the walls of the Alhambra, the Emperor <HI>Charles V.</HI> began a new palace, in 1568, but it was never fini&s;hed:&mdash;the &s;hell of it remains.</P>
<P>The Alhambra is a ma&s;s of many hou&s;es and towns, walled round, and built of large &s;tones, of different dimen&s;ions. Almo&s;t all the rooms have &s;tucco walls and cielings, &s;ome carved, &s;ome paint|ed, and &s;ome gilt, and all over-loaded with various Arabic &s;entences, &s;uch as, 'There is no other God but God;' which is repeated an infinite number of times. All the floors are either marble or tiled; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e in particular is paved with two &s;labs of white
<PB N="134" REF="133">
marble, each upwards of 13 feet long, and about half as broad. Some of the walls are encru&s;ted with a kind of coar&s;e Mo&s;aic, compo&s;ed of pieces of different coloured tiles, repre&s;enting &s;tars and &s;oliages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cortile, on entering the palace, is an oblong &s;quare, with a fountain at each angle; and in the middle is a canal of running water, deep and wide enough to &s;wim in. Round this cortile are &s;everal baths, the walls, floor, and cieling of which are of white marble. In tho&s;e parts of the Alham|bra, where bricks have been employed in the build|ing, the mortar between the bricks is as thick as the bricks them&s;elves. Almo&s;t all the columns are of white marble, and u&s;ually eight times their dia|meter, (which is one foot) in length.</P>
<P>The court mo&s;t to be admired of the Alhambra, is that called the <HI>Court of the Lions;</HI> it is orna|mented with 60 elegant columns, of an architec|ture which bears no re&s;emblance to any of the known orders, and might he called the Arabic or|der. "Architecture, (remarks <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) like all other arts, owes its origin to nature. The Goths, a northern people, inhabited caves. The Arabs and Saracens &s;pread over the country, lived under tents: hence that difference in the architecture of the&s;e nations. The Goths had flat cielings; tho&s;e of the
<PB N="135" REF="134">
Arabs were terminated in a point, as may be &s;een in mo&s;t of the apartments of the Alhambra."</P>
<P>But to return to this celebrated &s;quare; it is paved with white marble, and at the extremities are two fine Mo&s;aic cupolas, painted in gold colour and azure, and &s;upported by &s;everal groups of co|lumns. Portraits of &s;everal of the Moori&s;h Kings are pre&s;erved, under a kind of vaulted ceiling, at one end of the court. Near this place is a cro&s;s painted upon the wall, to indicate the place where the fir&s;t ma&s;s was &s;ung in the ca&s;tle of the Alham|bra, after it was taken by <HI>Ferdinand.</HI></P>
<P>This magnificent court is &s;urrounded by ba&s;ons of white marble, which form a kind of ca&s;cade or|namented with <HI>jets d'&eacute;au;</HI> but its principal monu|ment, and that from which it takes its name, is an alaba&s;ter cup, &s;ix feet in diameter, &s;upported by 12 lions, &s;aid to have been made in imitation of the brazen &s;ea of <HI>Solomon's</HI> temple. The cup is of one &s;ingle piece, ornamented with Arabic figures, and bears an in&s;cription of 24 ver&s;es, compo&s;ed in that language. The lions &s;pout water out of their mouths.</P>
<P>We next entered into the &s;aloon of <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> which is a &s;mall octangular room; a whi&s;per at one cor|ner is di&s;tinctly heard from the oppo&s;ite corner, but from no other place. The bathing-room is entirely
<PB N="136" REF="135">
of marble and coloured tiles, and in the mid&s;t is a fountain, which formerly &s;upplied the baths with water. Here are, be&s;ides, a great number of fountains, di&s;tributed in various rooms, which &s;till play.</P>
<P>In one of the rooms are two Roman &s;tatues of two nymphs, of white marble, as large as life, with cornucopias; and over a door is a very fine oval marble <HI>bas-relief,</HI> repre&s;enting <HI>Leda</HI> with the &s;wan, who&s;e neck is twi&s;ted round hers, and is be|&s;ides in a very indecent po&s;ture.</P>
<P>We afterwards walked through the gardens, which abound with orange and lemon-trees, pome|granates, myrtles, &amp;c. At the end is another pa|lace, called <HI>Ginaraliph,</HI> or the hou&s;e of love and plea&s;ure, &s;ituated on a more elevated &s;tation than the Alhambra; from the balconies is one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in Europe, over the whole fertile plain of Granada, bounded by the &s;nowy mount|ains. Clo&s;e to the entrance of this palace are two exceeding large cypre&s;s trees, which are near 500 years old, and are called cypre&s;&s;es of the Sultana Queen, as &s;he was di&s;covered, under them, in fami|liar conver&s;ation with <HI>Abencerrage.</HI> In one room the walls are covered with the three following in|&s;criptions, repeated hundreds of times, in Arabic,
<PB N="137" REF="136">
"God alone conquers,"&mdash;"Glory be to God."&mdash; "God is my hope."</P>
<P>In the gardens are two jars, or pitchers, of blue and white earthen ware, each &s;even feet high, and five in diameter, with various in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>"In examining this abode of magnificence, (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) the ob&s;erver is every moment a&s;toni&s;hed at the new and intere&s;ting mixture of architecture and poetry. The palace of the Alhambra may be called a collection of fugitive pieces; and, whatever duration the&s;e may have; time, with which every thing pa&s;&s;es away, has too much contributed to con|firm to them that title."</P>
<P>The city is divided into four wards, the principal of which, called Granada, lies in the plain, and in the vallies, between the two mountains. Here the nobility, clergy, merchants, and mo&s;t wealthy of the citizens re&s;ide. Its public and private build|ings are very hand&s;ome, and the &s;treets arched for the convenience of &s;upplying the hou&s;es with water, by the means of conduits.</P>
<P>The king's tribunal is held in a large and &s;tately edifice, and oppo&s;ite to it is the <HI>Alcaxeria,</HI> a va&s;t building, where the merchants have their warehou&s;es. In the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> are held the bull-&s;ights. Mo&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="137">
of the &s;mall hou&s;es are Moori&s;h built, or coar&s;e imi|tations of that manner; the modern ma&s;ons decora|ting their walls with uncouth copies of Saracenic Mo&s;aics. "From top to bottom, (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) they &s;eem to be nothing but rows of large windows, divided by narrow brick pila&s;ters."</P>
<P>The out&s;ides of the churches are painted in a the|atrical ta&s;te, and their in&s;ides &s;et off with a profu&s;ion of marble, brought from the neighbouring moun|tains. The dark green is the mo&s;t valuable. Ta|bles of an extraordinary &s;ize have been lately cut of that marble. There are al&s;o many hand&s;ome brown marbles and alaba&s;ters, diver&s;ified with an infinite number of &s;hades and tints. One whole &s;treet of artificers is employed in making little boxes, bracelets, necklaces, and other nick-nacks, which they retail cheap enough. It is u&s;ual in gen|tlemens' hou&s;es to frame fine &s;pecimens of marble and hang them up in the apartments, by way of or|nament.</P>
<P>The cathedral, which, in point of architecture, &s;tands very high in the opinion of the Granadines, is an a&s;&s;emblage of three churches. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> repo&s;e before the altar, under a large marble monument, full of figures and grote&s;ques, in a to|lerable good &s;tyle. Over the great door is the em|blem
<PB N="139" REF="138">
of the united monarchies, a bundle of arrows, together, clinched in the talons of an eagle.</P>
<P>The Alameda along the banks of the Xenil, is as plea&s;ant a walk as any in Spain. This and another drive beyond the river, are the chief re&s;ort of peo|ple both on foot or in coaches: and the beauty of Granada is no where more &s;triking, than from the&s;e points of view.</P>
<P>The environs of this town are delightful, even in the depth of winter. Every one allows, that in &s;ummer, Granada is a delicious abode, never too hot nor too cool, refre&s;hed by numberle&s;s &s;treams, and perfumed by all the &s;weets wafted from the gardens, &s;cattered over the declivities of the neighbouring hills. Nothing can be more agreeable, though at Chri&s;tmas, than the walks along the heights of the Alhambra. A great concour&s;e of people is always &s;een &s;itting there on the gra&s;s, ba&s;king in the &s;un, and diverting them&s;elves as at a fair. Venders of cakes, toys, and liquors, call their wares through the crowd. The women come dre&s;&s;ed out in all their finery; black &s;ilk petticoats and veils. In that dre&s;s, every woman has &s;omething &s;ingularly alluring. Here, indeed, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> the &s;ex is hand&s;ome in any dre&s;s; their complexions are fairer, their &s;kins clearer, and their cheeks glowing with a brighter tinge, than in any of the faces along

the coa&s;t. The di&s;tance of Granada from the &s;ea-ports, has probably pre&s;erved it from the general in|fection of that odious di&s;ea&s;e, which rages with &s;uch violence in all the&s;e trading towns. The &s;ur|pri&s;ing purity of the air, mu&s;t al&s;o greatly contri|bute towards the fre&s;hne&s;s of their looks. In many hou&s;es, a current of water pa&s;&s;es in an uncovered channel, through bed-chambers where people &s;leep, winter and &s;ummer, without its having the lea&s;t bad effect upon their health. Fruit and butchers' meat remain in the Alhambra an unu&s;ual length of time, without taint or putrefaction.</P>
<P>The city does not contain more than 50,000 in|habitants; of which number, 18,000 only are u&s;e|ful working hands; the &s;urplus is made up of law|yers, clergymen, children, and beggars. There are not le&s;s than 1000 &s;turdy, able-bodied ra&s;|cals, who live by arms, and conventual donation.</P>
<P>Here is an academy, as in all the great towns in Spain, for painting, &s;culpture, and architecture; conducted at the king's expence, and free for every one.</P>
<P>As for the manufactures, they are on the decay, receiving but little encouragement from local &s;itua|tion, and depre&s;&s;ed and ruined for want of proper political management. It is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak of

manufactures in Granada, without recalling to mind the expul&s;ion of the Moors. It is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged they were numerous; and that in con|&s;equence of their indu&s;try and frugality, they had acquired opulence and power. <HI>Philip III.</HI> in the year 1609, bani&s;hed 140,000 from the kingdom of Valencia, and 600,000 from Seville, Murcia, and Granada. If to the&s;e we add the numbers who pe|ri&s;hed by famine and the &s;word, we &s;hall be inclined to &s;tate the lo&s;s to Spain, at 1,000,000 of its mo&s;t active &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This lo&s;s, added to the previous expul&s;ion of 800,000 Jews, with all their wealth, in the reign of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> was under &s;uch a go|vernment as that of Spain, irreparable.</P>
<P>The Moors are acknowledged by the be&s;t Spani&s;h writers, to have excelled in agriculture, particularly in watering their lands, in the cultivation of mul|berry-trees, the &s;ugar cane, rice, and cotton; in their peculiar breed of hor&s;es, and in the manufac|tures of &s;ilk, paper, and gunpowder, fir&s;t brought into Europe by them.

and manufactures felt the &s;evere&s;t &s;hock. The &s;udden departure of this multitude, left a va|cuity, which it was not ea&s;y to fill up; more e&s;peci|ally by a nation, which, having for the &s;pace of &s;even centuries been trained to war, had learnt in that long interval, to look down with contempt upon all who were engaged in the mechanic arts, and more e&s;pecially to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e occupations in which their antagoni&s;ts excelled.</P>
<P>Numerous privileges and immunities enjoyed by the <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> or Knights, have contributed very much to confirm hereditary prejudices to the de|triment of trade. Till the year 1784, their per&s;ons and goods were free from arre&s;t. They are not &s;ent to the common gaols, but either confined in ca&s;tles or in their own hou&s;e on their parole of honour. They are not hanged, but &s;trangled. They are ex|empted from various taxes, to which others are li|able. None but the royal family can be quartered on them. To conclude, the noble female conveys all the&s;e privileges to her hu&s;band and children, in the &s;ame manner as the elde&s;t daughter of the titular nobility tran&s;mits the title of her ance&s;|tors.</P>
<P>The proportion of Hidalgos in this province, is not con&s;iderable, for out of 653,000 inhabitants, only about 2000 are nobles; but in the kingdom of
<PB N="143" REF="143">
Leon, where there is not one third of that popula|tion, the knights amount to 22,000.</P>
<P>The manners of the inhabitants are nearly the &s;ame as in the other inland cities. The morning is employed in bu&s;ine&s;s by tho&s;e who have any thing to do, or in vi&s;its to the ladies. They dine early, and eat after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion, with the &s;opa, the olla, and various kinds of meat, &s;tewed in their lit|tle pitchers, except at one or two of the principal hou&s;es, where the French cookery prevails. After dinner they go to the fie&s;ta, in the evening to the pa&s;eo, or public walk. When the evening clo&s;es, they a&s;&s;embly at the Tertulia, where they generally amu&s;e them&s;elves with cards.</P>
<P>Their morals are much like the re&s;t of Spain; the monks are exceedingly debauched, and the women do not want admirers.</P>
<P>Malaga is a &s;mall, but very ancient city. The Phoenicians built it &s;everal centuries before <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and called it <HI>Malacha,</HI> on account of the great quan|tities of &s;alt fi&s;h &s;old there. <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> give it the name of <HI>Malaca;</HI> and the latter adds, that it belonged to the allies of the Romans. <HI>Antoninus,</HI> in his Itinerary, de&s;cribes a road from Ca&s;telon to Malaca, and another from Malaca to Gades or Cadiz. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;peaks of it as a Carthaginian co|lony,
<PB N="144" REF="144">
very commercial and famous for its &s;alted provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>After having been built by the Phoenicians, it pa&s;|&s;ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the dominion of the Cartha|ginians, Romans, Goths, and Moors. The fir&s;t &s;overeign who &s;wayed the &s;ceptre there, and made it the &s;eat of empire, was <HI>Haly Abenhamith.</HI> When this monarch had e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;overeignty over the kingdoms of Granada and Murcia, he marched at the head of his victorious troops to Cordova, where having &s;lain the u&s;urper <HI>Zuleman,</HI> he took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the vacant throne, and left the united em|pire to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It was not till the year 1487, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> recovered Malaga from the dominion of the Moors. At that period, it mu&s;t have been a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength, and two &s;trong towers, with their communicating walls, appear to have been the chief dependance of the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>The town is &s;ituated in a valley of no great extent, on the &s;ide of a deep ravin, which in &s;ummer con|tains no water, but in winter affords a pa&s;&s;age to a con&s;iderable river. A Moori&s;h ca&s;tle on the &s;harp point of a rock, commands every part of it. <HI>Bour|goanne</HI> gives it the appellation of a hand&s;ome city, and that the Mole is &s;upported by a magnificent
<PB N="145" REF="145">
quay. <HI>Town&s;end's</HI> de&s;cription of the city is, that the hou&s;es are high, the &s;treets contracted, and that many of them are not more than eight feet wide, others not even &s;o wide, and that they are all badly paved, and dirty even to a proverb.</P>
<P>Of the buildings, whether public or private, the only one worthy of the lea&s;t attention, is the cathe|dral, a very &s;tupendous pile, begun by <HI>Philip II.</HI> while married to <HI>Mary,</HI> Queen of England. Their united arms are &s;till to be be &s;een over the door. It is a&s;&s;ured by &s;ome travellers, who have mea&s;ured both churches, that this cathedral is as large as that of <HI>St. Paul's</HI> in London.</P>
<P>The convents, though numerous, are few of them remarkable, either for architecture, or for any mo|numents of art. The bi&s;hopric is a very con&s;ider|able one, being e&s;timated to bring in near &pound;17,000 &s;terling a year.</P>
<P>There are about 14 foreign hou&s;es, &s;ays <HI>Swinburne,</HI> &s;ettled in trade at Malaga, who export 5000 butts of wine a year, of which the price runs from 10 to 30 pounds a butt. Till within the&s;e la&s;t 20 years, the quantity &s;ent off was double, but no difference being made in England, on the duties between old and new wine, the exporter grew carele&s;s in the quality of the wine &s;ent, and the demand of it &s;ell one half.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="146"><HI>Town&s;end,</HI> on the other hand, &s;ays, that one mer|chant, whom he names <HI>Martinis,</HI> exported 5000 butts a year, and other merchants in the &s;ame pro|portion to their u&s;ual &s;ales. The other exports are fruit, oil, and fi&s;h. Their fi&s;h are anchovies, of which, in years of great abundance, they have &s;old 10,000 barrels, of two quintals each. It is com|puted there are from 800 to 1000 ve&s;&s;els, which en|ter the port of Malaga every year; of the&s;e one tenth only are Spani&s;h.</P>
<P>The chief dependance of this country, is on the vines. The&s;e are cultivated with much labour, and at a great expence: when it is con&s;idered that the&s;e vineyards are always on the declivity of hills, in|clined towards the &s;corching &s;un, it may be readily conceived, that the labour is &s;evere; and that the people, who, with unremitted application, perform this ta&s;k, cannot de&s;erve the character of drones. The pea&s;ants of no country upon earth, are more pa|tient of heat, hunger, and thir&s;t, or capable of greater exertions, than this very people, who have been accu&s;ed of indolence. In the di&s;trict of Ma|laga, it is computed there are 14,000 vine pre&s;&s;es, chiefly employed in making the rich wines, which if white, from the nature of the country round Ma|laga being high, rugged, and pointed, is called mountain; if red, from the colour, <HI>vino tinto,</HI> known to us by the name of tent.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="147">For the purpo&s;e of making the&s;e wines fuller in the body, and &s;weeter than they would otherwi&s;e be, the grapes are left to be very ripe; then, being cut, they are expo&s;ed to the &s;un to evaporate their moi&s;|ture, after which they are pre&s;&s;ed, and put into ve&s;&s;els, with a due proportion of in&s;pi&s;&s;ated vinous &s;yrup.</P>
<P>Murders and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, with every &s;pecies of violence and exce&s;s, mu&s;t, without the &s;trenuous ex|ertions of the magi&s;trate, and the &s;trict execution of the laws, be frequent in a country, where, whenever the wind blows over land, all the pa&s;&s;ions are in|flamed, and in &s;ome per&s;ons, almo&s;t to frenzy. Yet here ju&s;tice, when mo&s;t awakened, pur&s;ues offenders with a tardy &s;tep, &s;low in its approach, and uncer|tain in its vengeance. In&s;tances are cited of crimi|nals, who have died forgotten in their pri&s;ons, and of others, who, whil&s;t under &s;entence of death, have married, had numerous offsprings, and been brought forth to execution, when all recollection of their crimes had been long &s;ince obliterated.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;ultry regions, where the overwhelming heat of the &s;un is &s;ucceeded by the refre&s;hing coolne&s;s of the evening, wander abroad; and when the light is gone, all the young people bathe for hours in the &s;ea. The &s;exes, how|ever, do not bathe promi&s;cuou&s;ly, but at &s;ome di&s;|tance
<PB N="148" REF="148">
from each other. At &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, to prevent intru&s;ion, the &s;pot where the ladies are, is guarded by centinels with loaded mu&s;kets, and &s;hould a gen|tleman attempt to &s;wim round to them, it mu&s;t be at the hazard of his life. Whenever, therefore, a young per&s;on is determined to intrude, he goes in di&s;gui&s;e as the female attendant of &s;ome frail fair, and in that character pa&s;&s;es unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom of bathing every night, is practi&s;ed not &s;o much for plea&s;ure as for health, being intend|ed to obviate the inconvenience ari&s;ing from the exce&s;&s;ive heat. Yet, notwith&s;tanding, the di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from relaxed fibres, are very prevalent: (for not to mention tho&s;e which ari&s;e from irritability of nerves, the con&s;equence of debility,) tertian and putrid fevers rage with &s;uch violence, that more than 3000 per&s;ons died, (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) in the year he was there, be&s;ides multitudes in the city and its environs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of the Province or Kingdom of Cordova, and Andalu&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>THIS ancient kingdom is one of the &s;malle&s;t in Spain, it has been by &s;ome writers comprehended under Andalu&s;ia, which in former times compri&s;ed Granada, Cordova, and Seville; but the province of Cordova, which was the ea&s;tern part of Andalu&s;ia, having been by later writers &s;poken of &s;eparately, we &s;hall follow that divi&s;ion, and include only the kingdom of Seville, under the general name of Andalu&s;ia, of which, in the ancient divi&s;ion, it formed the we&s;tern part.</P>
<P>In the province of Cordova, there appears little in its modern &s;tate to attract attention, bu&s;ides its capital; it is &s;ituated in a plain of great extent, bounded on the &s;outh by &s;welling hills, cultivated to their very &s;ummits, and on the north by a chain of rugged mountains, the continuation of the Sierra Morena. Through the mid&s;t of the plain, runs the Guadalquivir, and the whole country being well wooded, well watered, and well cultivated, can|not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed either in riches or beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="150">This city, anciently called <HI>Corduba,</HI> was illu&s;tri|ous, &s;o far back as the time of the Romans. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays, it was founded by <HI>Marcellus,</HI> and was the fir&s;t Roman colony e&s;tabli&s;hed in Spain. All who have written on Cordova, have called it the mother of men of genius. In the fir&s;t ages after the founda|tion of this city, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a univer&s;ity, in which all the &s;ciences were cultivated. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays, the ancient books of the <HI>Turdetani,</HI> their poverty and their laws, all written in ver&s;e, were here pre&s;erved. It had the honour of giving birth to the two <HI>Sene|ca's,</HI> and to <HI>Lucan</HI> the poet.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Abdoulraman,</HI> after &s;ubduing the &s;outh of Spain, had e&s;tabli&s;hed here the &s;eat of his domi|nion. A. D. 759, the &s;ciences, with arts and arms, which were every where el&s;e abandoned, took up their re&s;idence, and flouri&s;hed in this city. It was within the walls of this city, that the 30 philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians, who compo&s;ed, and put in order the works of <HI>Avicenna</HI> were formed.</P>
<P>This city (&s;ays <HI>Peyron</HI>) has pre&s;erved nothing of its ancient grandeur, except a va&s;t enclo&s;ure, filled with hou&s;es half in ruins, and the famous mo&s;que built by <HI>Abdoulraman,</HI> in the eighth century. This monument is really worthy the attention of the cu|rious. After the conque&s;t of Cordova, it was con|verted into a cathedral, and not more than half of it
<PB N="151" REF="151">
now exi&s;ts; but &s;uch as it is, nothing would equal its magnificence, were the height proportioned to its extent.</P>
<P>The roof is &s;u&s;tained by a great number of co|umns, placed in &s;uch an irregular manner, as to make it very difficult to count them. They are reckoned to be above 800; <HI>Town&s;end</HI> &s;ays he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e there were many more. Some de&s;criptions of this church, reckon 29 ai&s;les, others only 19, but the whole is &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, as renders it very difficult to give any tolerable idea of this build|ing. It is &s;aid to have been a temple of <HI>Janus</HI> be|fore the time of the Moors, which is very probable, from &s;ome of the columns having Corinthian capi|tals. The columns are each of a &s;ingle piece, &s;ome of marble, &s;ome of ja&s;per, of granite, of porphyry, of alaba&s;ter, of verde antico, &amp;c. The &s;quare be|fore this church is very beautiful, being planted with 80 large orange trees; in the mid&s;t is a pond full of tench, and on each &s;ide a fountain continually playing; the&s;e are environed with cypre&s;s and palm trees.</P>
<P>A bridge of 16 arches, defended by a large Moor|i&s;h tower, leads from the &s;outh into Cordova, and near the end of the bridge, &s;tands the above mo&s;que, converted into a cathedral. The walls of the
<PB N="152" REF="152">
town are in many places ju&s;t as the Romans left them.</P>
<P>This city contains 32,000 inhabitants, 14 pari&s;hes, and 44 convents. Few of the public or private buildings are con&s;picuous for their architecture. The great &s;quare is large and regular, and &s;urrounded by porticos. The bi&s;hop's palace is &s;eated on the &s;ide of the river, and his gardens are open to the public.</P>
<P>The ancient palace of the Moors has been con|verted into &s;tables, in which 100 Andalu&s;ian hor&s;es are generally kept. Their genealogy is carefully pre&s;erved, and the name and age of each written over the place in which he &s;tands; and as the hor&s;es are very &s;pirited, their hinder feet are fa&s;tened to iron rings, fixed to a &s;taple in the ground. The mares are kept in the environs, and in the proper &s;ea&s;on, the hor&s;es are taken to them.</P>
<P>Cordova is the greate&s;t market for hor&s;es in all Spain; it is here that the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated Andalu&s;ian hor&s;es are to be &s;een, which it is death to export; they are all long tailed and entire, very few geldings being &s;een in Spain. Mates are only kept for breeding and treading out the corn: the&s;e are allowed to be exported. They are fed with wheat &s;traw, which is preferable to hay,
<PB N="153" REF="153">
by rea&s;on of its juicy delicacy; &s;ometimes barley is given to them.</P>
<P>"This city (&s;ay <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) is the mo&s;t agreeable of any in Spain for a place of re&s;idence:&mdash;Here are about 30 noble families, who alternately &s;pend the evenings at each other's hou&s;es. They live in great &s;plendor, and have equipages much more magnificent than in any other part of Spain: here are 14 or 15 coaches, chariots, or phaetons, which were lately made in London, and as many more procured from Paris. All the&s;e (&s;ays the above writer) I had an opportunity of &s;eeing drawn by four and &s;ix long-tailed beautiful prancing &s;tone-hor&s;es, as it was then Whit&s;untide-fair; the foot|men were all dre&s;&s;ed in gold and &s;ilver laced live|ries. At a ball to which I was invited, the Engli&s;h country dances con&s;i&s;ted of near 30 couple; the refre&s;hments were, chocolate, lemonade, ice-creams, cakes, and various kinds of wines and <HI>liqueurs.</HI> The &s;aloon we danced in, very large, hung with crim|&s;on dama&s;k, enriched with &s;everal of the St. Ilde|fon&s;o looking-gla&s;&s;es; the ceiling of white &s;tucco, with gilt foliages; and the whole of the&s;e elegant decorations executed in the French ta&s;te. Among the company much more freedom might be ob|&s;erved than at any grand ball in England, and none of that ob&s;tinate &s;hyne&s;s and re&s;erve, &s;o peculiarly chara&s;teri&s;tic of the Briti&s;h nation. Mo&s;t of the
<PB N="154" REF="154">
furniture in the&s;e palaces was Engli&s;h, as chairs, ta|bles, carpets, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Upon the borders of this province, on the <HI>Sierra Morena,</HI> or chain of mountains, &s;eparating Anda|lu&s;ia from New Ca&s;tille, and called <HI>Morena,</HI> from its brown colour, is the new colony of <HI>La Carolina,</HI> planted a few years &s;ince by the king, in a very ex|ten&s;ive tract of woody mountainous country. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were Germans; but, from eating un|whole&s;ome herbs, and drinking too freely of &s;pirits, above half of them died; and now the inhabitants are a mixture of Germans, French, Savoyards and Spaniards.</P>
<P>They talk of 10,000 families being already &s;ettled here. Every new comer, on application, receives a lot of land, a hou&s;e, two cows, one a&s;s, five &s;heep, as many goats, &s;ix hens with a cock, one pregnant &s;ow, a plough, and a pick-axe, with other emolu|ments of inferior value. They begin with 50 <HI>fane|gas</HI> of land, of 10,000 &s;quare feet each; and, when they have cultivated the&s;e, they receive 50 more, free of all rent for the fir&s;t ten years; and, after that period, &s;ubject only to the royal tythes.</P>
<P><HI>La Carolina,</HI> the capital of all the colonies, &s;tands on a fine hill, towering over the whole &s;ettlement. For the &s;ake of thus overlooking the re&s;t of the plan|tations,
<PB N="155" REF="155">
they have placed it in a &s;pot deficient in wood and water; and reduced them&s;elves to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of digging an incredible number of wells, for the purpo&s;es of drinking, and watering their gardens. The whole town was new from the foundations, for there was not a cottage there ten years &s;ince. The &s;treets are wide, and drawn in &s;traight lines, but the ground is not &s;ufficiently le|velled; the hou&s;es are upon one uniform plan, with|out the lea&s;t decoration. All the flat on the crown of the hill is laid out in kitchen-gardens, and planted with avenues of elms, to &s;erve hereafter as public walks.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the town has been built and peopled in le&s;s than ten years, we cannot but ad|mire the energy and zeal of <HI>Olavid&eacute;,</HI> the founder, who conceived the idea of introducing agriculture and arts in the de&s;art mountains of the Sierra, where rapine and violence had for ages e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion. "This colony, however, (&s;ays <HI>Town|&s;end</HI>) is far from pro&s;pering; which has been ge|nerally attributed to the want of a market for the &s;urplus of their produce."</P>
<P>The &s;ame remarks have been made by <HI>Swin|burne,</HI> who &s;ays, there does not &s;eem to be an outlet from this &s;ettlement, in ca&s;e their manufac|tures &s;hould arrive at any perfection, for it is ex|tremely
<PB N="156" REF="156">
remote from the &s;ea, and many days jour|ney by land from the great cities in Spain, where the con&s;umption of their commodities might be ex|pected to turn to any account.</P>
<P>Andalu&s;ia is bounded by that long chain of mountains, called <HI>Sierra Morena,</HI> on the north; by Murcia and Granada on the ea&s;t; by Granada, the Streights of Gibraltar, and the Atlantic on the &s;outh; and by Portugal, from which it is &s;eparated from the Guadiana on the we&s;t; its extent, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is about 90 leagues; but its breadth varies very much, being in &s;ome places not above 30. It has the advantage of near 70 leagues of &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The name of Andalu&s;ia, which it owes to the Vandals who &s;ettled here in the fifth century, is de|rived from <HI>Vandalenhaus,</HI> and from thence, by cor|ruption, came Andalu&s;ia. In former times it was called <HI>Tarte&s;&s;is</HI> and <HI>Boetica.</HI> The Moors took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this province in the eighth century. The river Guadalquavir, by the ancients called <HI>Boetis</HI> and <HI>Tarte&s;&s;us,</HI> traver&s;es the whole country, and the Guadiana, as we have before remarked, &s;eparates it, to the we&s;t, from the Portugue&s;e Algarve. Of the other &s;maller rivers, &s;ome run directly into the &s;ea; as the Odier and the Tinto, the water of which lat|ter river cannot be drank, being noxious even to
<PB N="157" REF="157">
herbs and the roots of trees, and having neither fi&s;h nor any living creature in it; and the Guadalate, or river of oblivion. Others fall into the Guadalquivir, as the Guadiamar, and the Xenil, which ri&s;es in Granada, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Andalu&s;ia is reckoned the fine&s;t province in all Spain, abounding in exqui&s;ite fruits of all kinds; honey, excellent wines, grain, &s;ilk, &s;ugar, fine oil, numerous herds of cattle, particularly hor&s;es, me|tals, cinnabar, and a certain &s;pecies of quick&s;ilver. The heat in &s;ummer is very great, but the inhabi|tants generally deep in the day-time, and travel, and follow their occupations in the night.</P>
<P>The principal cities in this province are Seville, Cadiz, and Gibraltar.</P>
<P>Seville, the capital of Andalu&s;ia, &s;tands on the banks of the Guadalquavir, in the mid&s;t of a rich and, to the eye, a boundle&s;s plain. It is &s;urround|ed by a wall of more than a league in circumference, with 126 towns. The ancient name of this city was <HI>Hi&s;palis,</HI> which name was pre&s;erved to it by the Latins. The Goths, from <HI>Hi&s;palis,</HI> made <HI>Hi&s;|palia,</HI> But the Arabians, who came after them, not pronouncing the <HI>p,</HI> called it <HI>Ixbilla,</HI> of which the Ca&s;tillians have made Seville. <HI>Arias Montano</HI> derives the name Hi&s;palis, from the Phoenician word <HI>Spala,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="158">
or <HI>Spila,</HI> which, in that language, &s;ignifies plain, or field of verdure. The Romans granted it the privileges of a Roman colony, and called it <HI>Julia Ro|mula,</HI> or little Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Hercules</HI> is &s;aid to have been the founder of Se|ville; and the opinion is &s;o general, that it is current among the people, by long tradition; it is even in|&s;cribed on the gates of the city.</P>
<P>There &s;till remain in Seville &s;everal &s;tatues of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> be&s;ides that &s;upported by two antique columns at the Alameda. Of the 43 <HI>Hercu|les,</HI> mentioned in hi&s;tory or fable, two came into Spain; one was a Lybian, the other from Thebes. The latter came to Cadiz with the Argonauts, and went thence to Gibraltar, where he founded a city, which he called Heraclea. This <HI>Hercules</HI> came about 1000 years after the other, &s;o famous for his 12 labours, his &s;trength, and his courage. It re|mains to be known which of the two founded Se|ville.</P>
<P>Under the Roman government this city was em|belli&s;hed with many magnificent buildings, the very ruins of which have long &s;ince di&s;appeared. The Gothic kings made this city their re&s;idence, before they removed their court to Toledo. In the gene|ral confu&s;ion en&s;uing upon the downfal of the king|dom
<PB N="159" REF="159">
of Cordova, in 1027, Seville became an inde|pendent &s;overeignty.</P>
<P><HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the third King of Ca&s;tille, after a year's reign, forced Seville to open its gates to him, and acknowledge his &s;way. Three hundred thou&s;and Moors are &s;aid to have left the city upon the capitu|lation, and to have carried their arms and indu&s;try to &s;uch countries as were obedient to the law of Mahomet. It is difficult to conceive how Seville could continue to be a great and populous city after &s;uch an emigration; yet we find it in a few years enlarged, adorned with new buildings, the chief of which was the cathedral, and long enjoying the rank of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Spain.</P>
<P>Its mo&s;t brilliant epocha, was &s;oon after the di&s;co|very of America, when all the trea&s;ures from that quarter of the globe were poured into Europe, and Seville made the magazine of its valuable produc|tions. The Sovereign frequently honoured this city with his pre&s;ence; merchants from all parts flocked hither to open hou&s;es of commerce, or to provide them&s;elves with goods for foreign markets; the &s;ai|lors and adventurers of the Indian fleets rendez|vou&s;ed here, and with wanton prodigality lavi&s;hed the wealth which they had acquired in America. Then, indeed, was the time when the Spaniard cried out in the fulne&s;s of his heart. <HI>He that has not &s;een
<PB N="160" REF="160">
Seville, has not &s;een the wonder of the World.</HI> Its court was then the mo&s;t &s;plendid in Europe; its &s;treets were thronged with an immen&s;e concour&s;e of people; its river was crowded with &s;hips, and its keys covered with bales of precious merchandize. Great were the buildings begun, and &s;till greater the projects for future ones. Its pro&s;perity &s;eemed proof again&s;t the ficklene&s;s of fortune, when the danger and embarra&s;&s;ments in the navigation of the Guadalquiver, occa&s;ioned it to fall from the highe&s;t pitch of grandeur, to &s;olitude and poverty. From the &s;uperior excellence of the Port of Cadiz, the Galeons were ordered to be &s;tationed there in fu|ture.</P>
<P>The &s;hape of Seville is circular, without any great ri&s;ing in its whole extent. The walls &s;eem of Moori&s;h con&s;truction, or of the ages following the di&s;&s;olution of the Saracenic empire. The ditch in many places is filled up. The circuit of the walls is not more than &s;ix miles. The &s;uburb of Triana, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, is as large as many towns, but remarkable for nothing but its gloomy gothic ca&s;tle, where, in 1481, the inqui&s;ition formed its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment in Spain.</P>
<P>Seville, (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) is the large&s;t city in the king|dom of Spain, and is &s;ituated in the middle of a plain, as level as any part of Holland. The river
<PB N="161" REF="161">
Guadalquiver divides it into two unequal parts; that on the &s;outh &s;ide is called Triana: the&s;e parts are joined together by a mean and &s;habby bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of planks laid on ten boats, forming the &s;egment of a circle, according as the tide runs.</P>
<P>There were at the time I was there, (&s;ays the above writer) 14 Dutch ve&s;&s;els lying near the bridge, wait|ing for their cargoes of wool, which is a very dan|gerous commodity; for if proper care be not taken to air it frequently, by opening the hatches of the ve&s;&s;el, it takes fire; a Dutch ve&s;&s;el was by this means burnt down to the water's edge, a &s;hort time before my arrival: this happened in the river, &s;o that the crew &s;aved their lives; but if &s;uch an accident &s;hould happen at &s;ea, the con&s;equence is evident. This river is neither broad nor rapid, but very deep.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are narrow, and &s;ome of them &s;o con|tracted, that both walls may be touched at the &s;ame time. Few are wide enough for carriages; and many through which coaches pa&s;s, &s;hew, by the deep furrows in the walls, that one have touched, and often both at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This city is &s;aid to contain 80,000 inhabitants, and is divided into 30 pari&s;hes. It has 84 convents, with 24 ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="162">Of the public edifices, the cathedral is the fir&s;t to demand attention; it is a building of &s;ingular magnificence, but chiefly admired for its tower, the work of <HI>Guever,</HI> a Moor. It was originally built only 250 feet high, but was afterwards rai&s;ed 100 more, and is therefore at pre&s;ent 350 feet. It has no &s;teps, nor are they required; becau&s;e the inclined plain is &s;o ea&s;y of a&s;cent, that a hor&s;e might trot from the bottom to the top; and at the &s;ame time it is &s;o broad, that two hor&s;emen might ride abrea&s;t. On the top of this tower is the Giralda, or large brazen image, 14 feet height, which, with its palm-branch, weighs near one ton and a half, yet turns with the &s;lighte&s;t variation of the wind. The effect of this tower ri&s;ing above every edifice in Seville, is extremely noble.</P>
<P>The Moors erected this tower about the year 1000. Tradition relates, that to form a &s;olid foun|dation for it, the Moors made a deep hole, into which they ca&s;t all the marble and &s;tone monuments of the Romans that could be found. When repairs have been nece&s;&s;ary, and the ground has been opened near the bottom, many broken ornaments and in|&s;criptions have been di&s;covered. For &s;ome purpo&s;e, unknown to po&s;terity, the architect has made the &s;olid ma&s;onry in the upper half, ju&s;t as thick again as that in the lower, though on the out&s;ide it is all the way of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="163">The dimen&s;ions of the cathedral are 420 feet, by 263, and the height is 126. It was built A. D. 1401. This cathedral receives light by four&s;core windows, with painted gla&s;s, the work of <HI>Arnao,</HI> of Flanders, each of which co&s;t 1000 ducats.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ures of this church are ine&s;timable; one altar is wholly &s;ilver, with all its ornaments, as are the images, large as life, of <HI>S. I&s;idore,</HI> and <HI>S. Leander,</HI> and a tabernacle for the ho&s;t, more than 12 feet high, adorned with 48 columns; yet the value of the&s;e is trifling, when compared with the gold and precious &s;tones depo&s;ited by the piety of Catholics, during the period in which all the wealth of the newly di&s;covered world flowed into this city. The profu|&s;ion of gold, &s;ilver, and gems, would be more &s;trik|ing, were not the attention occupied and lo&s;t in ad|miration of innumerable pictures which were the works of tho&s;e Spani&s;h ma&s;ters, who flouri&s;hed immediately after the arrival of the art in Seville.</P>
<P>To the cathedral belongs a library of 20,000 vo|lumes, collected by <HI>Hernando,</HI> &s;on to <HI>Chri&s;topher Colon,</HI> the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of America.</P>
<P>The new organ in this church, contains 5300 pipes, with 110 &s;tops, which are &s;aid to be 50 more than in the famous one of Harlaem; yet &s;o capacious are the bellows, that when filled, they &s;upply the
<PB N="164" REF="164">
organ 15 minutes. The mode of filling them with air is &s;ingular; a man walks backwards and forwards along an inclined plain of about 15 feet in length, which is ballanced in the middle on its axis. Pa&s;|&s;ing ten times along the inclined plain, fills the bel|lows.</P>
<P>In the cathedral are 82 altars, at which are &s;aid daily 500 ma&s;&s;es. The annual con&s;umption is 1500 arrobas of wine, 800 of oil, and 1000 of wax. The archbi&s;hop has a revenue of nearly &pound;33,000 a year. There are be&s;ides eleven dignitaries, who, on high fe&s;tivals, wear the mitre, amply provided for.</P>
<P>Many of the convents are remarkable for the beauty of their architecture; but in Seville, the eye covets only pictures, and amid&s;t the profu&s;ion of the&s;e, it overlooks works, which in other &s;ituations, would rivet the attention, and every where fixes on the pencil of <HI>Murillo.</HI> His mo&s;t famous perform|ances are in the ho&s;pital de la Caridad, and, &s;uited to the in&s;titution, expre&s;s &s;ome act of charity. The church of the Capuchins is al&s;o richly furni&s;hed with his works. Eleven of his pictures are to be &s;een in a chapel, called De la vera Cruz, belonging to the Franci&s;cans. But the mo&s;t ma&s;terly of all his works, (&s;ays <HI>Town&s;end</HI>) is in the refectory of an ho&s;pital, de&s;igned for the reception of &s;uperannuated prie&s;ts.
<PB N="165" REF="165">
It repre&s;ents an angel holding a ba&s;ket to the infant <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who, &s;tanding on his mother's lap, takes bread from it to feed three venerable prie&s;ts. No repre|&s;entation ever approached nearer to real life, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee more expre&s;&s;ion than glows upon that canva&s;s. This great painter was born in the year 1618, and died in 1682. His name &s;tands high in Europe, but to form an adequate idea of his ex|cellence, every convent &s;hould be vi&s;ited, where he depo&s;ited the monuments of his &s;uperior &s;kill. In exactne&s;s of imitation, he has been equalled; in the <HI>clair ob&s;cur,</HI> and in reflected lights, he was &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Vela&s;quez;</HI> but not one of all the Spani&s;h arti&s;ts have gone beyond him in tenderne&s;s and &s;oft|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Murillo, Vala&s;quez,</HI> and <HI>De Valdes,</HI> three of the be&s;t Spani&s;h painters, were all born in or near Se|ville; no wonder, therefore, that &s;o many of their paintings are to be found in this royal city.</P>
<P>The Alcazar, or palace of the Moori&s;h kings, is an irregular building, but commodious and plea&s;ant|ly &s;ituated, compri&s;ing many large and well propor|tioned rooms. The modern part of this palace, has the celebrated motto of <HI>Charles V, Plus ultra,</HI> in&s;erted in every room, together with the Imperial Eagle. <HI>Charles</HI> was fond and vain of this motto.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="166">The garden is &s;ingular, and having obtained its pri&s;tine form, is meant to &s;erve as a model of the Moori&s;h ta&s;te. It is laid out in alleys, with clipped myrtle hedges, and in the middle of the parterres are &s;ingle trees, cut into the form of warriors, with &s;piked clubs. The whole of this plea&s;ure garden, with the palace and the court-yard, is &s;urrounded by a &s;trong rampart, communicating with, but much higher than, the city wall; and beyond this is an orange grove of con&s;iderable extent. For the winter, and for the &s;pring, there cannot be a more de|lightful re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Of the convents, that which is upon the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive &s;cale, belongs to the Franci&s;cans. It con|tains 15 cloi&s;ters, many of which are elegant and &s;pacious, with apartments for 200 monks. Their annual expenditure is about &pound;4000.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity was founded in the year 1502, and &s;oon ro&s;e into con&s;ideration. The name of <HI>Arias Montanus,</HI> who lies buried at the convent of <HI>S. Jago,</HI> is alone &s;ufficient to give celebrity to this &s;eminary. His tran&s;lation of the holy &s;criptures, will be va|lued by the learned, as long as the &s;criptures them|&s;elves &s;hall be the object of veneration to mankind. The number of under graduates here, is about 500.</P>
<P>The Spaniards look upon this city and its envi|rons,
<PB N="167" REF="167">
as a perfect paradi&s;e, e&s;pecially in fine even|ings, which they are &s;eldom without, when all the people of fa&s;hion repair to the neighbouring fields in their coaches, to breathe the fragrant air, per|fumed with a variety of &s;weet flowers and blo&s;&s;oms, that nature produces in almo&s;t every &s;ea&s;on. The olives are the be&s;t in Europe, and are here in prodigious quantities: there is a grove of them, not far from the city, twenty miles in circum|ference.</P>
<P>The <HI>Almeida,</HI> or Mall, is about three furlongs in length, divided into four &s;hady walks, by five rows of trees; it is, be&s;ides, embelli&s;hed with fountains and &s;eats, and &s;mall canals of water run|ning along the border of each row of trees. This Mall is further remarkable for having two very high columns of granite, taken from a temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> which exi&s;ted here in times of very remote antiquity; on the top of one is placed a &s;tatue of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and on the other that of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> At the other end are two modern columns, with a lion on the top of each.</P>
<P>Between the hours of &s;ix and eight in the evening the Spani&s;h ladies re&s;ort hither in their carriages; and, from ten to midnight, they return again to walk, e&s;pecially on Sundays, attended by their <HI>corlejos.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="168">The royal tobacco manufacture is &s;ituated ju&s;t without the walls, it was built in 1757, wholly of white &s;tone. The building is a &s;quare of 240 feet, and of two &s;tories in height: the chief front has 29 windows, and the others nearly the &s;ame num|ber. Fifteen hundred men are con&s;tantly employ|ed in this manufacture of &s;ugars and &s;nuff, and 190 hor&s;es alternately turn 80 mills for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The whole fabric co&s;t nearly half a million &s;ter|ling. The net revenue amounts to one million &s;terling, it being the only manufacture in the kingdom.</P>
<P>There is but one door by which it can be entered, to prevent labourers from &s;muggling the tobacco, which &s;ome of them, neverthele&s;s, found means to do by a very uncommon method, which was di&s;co|vered by their being obliged to be cured of the in|flammation happening to the part where they had concealed it. The fir&s;t three or four days of their coming to work, the volatile parts of the tobacco and &s;nuff affect them &s;o much as to cau&s;e them to &s;tagger and reel as if they were intoxicated.</P>
<P>The leaves of the tobacco are imported from Cu|ba and the Brazils; the be&s;t &s;nuff is called <HI>Grance.</HI> Eight &s;hillings a pound is the current price of the &s;nuff in Seville. It is made by grinding and mix|ing the tobacco with the red earth of Almazar|ron,

a kind of ochre. The exce&s;&s;ive adulteration of this earth, practi&s;ed of late years by the Directors, has occa&s;ioned a great falling off in the exportation of this commodity; and, unle&s;s they alter their me|thod, the trade will &s;oon be confined to Spain and its dominions.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al u&s;e of &s;nuff and tobacco in almo&s;t all countries, and the va&s;t &s;ums of money gained by its commerce and manufactures, is wonderful, when we con&s;ider how few years have elap&s;ed &s;ince its fir&s;t introduction, compared with other articles of commerce. <HI>Sir Walter Raliegh</HI> was the fir&s;t per&s;on, we are told, that &s;moaked it, and this while he was in America; and it is related, whil&s;t he was lighting his pipe, having &s;ent out his black &s;ervant for &s;omething to drink, the poor fellow on his return finding the &s;moke i&s;&s;ue from his ma&s;|ter's mouth in volumes, conceived him to be on fire, and in&s;tantly threw the contents of the pot in his face, in order to extingui&s;h it.</P>
<P>The &s;ilk manufacture was formerly con&s;iderable at Seville. When <HI>Ferdinand III.</HI> in the year 1248, entered the city, he found, as it is &s;aid, 16,000 looms, which employed 130,000 per&s;ons; and &s;uch was the population of the city, that the Moors who left it, when it was &s;urrendered to the Chri&s;tians, were 400,000, be&s;ides multitudes who died during
<PB N="170" REF="171">
a 16 months' &s;iege, and many who remained after their fellow-citizens were gone. On the fir&s;t di&s;|covery of America they once more reckoned 16,000 looms, but &s;ome heavy taxes impo&s;ed by <HI>Philip II.</HI> during the latter end of his reign, and the &s;ub&s;e|quent expul&s;ion of the Moors, gave a &s;hock to com|merce it has not yet recovered.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of Seville is a curious monument of antiquity, the amphitheatre of <HI>Italica.</HI> It is an oval of 291 feet by 204. Italica is the city where <HI>Trajan, Adrian,</HI> and <HI>Theodo&s;ius the Great</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been born. Of the ancient colony of Italica, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been compo&s;ed by <HI>Scipio,</HI> of his veteran &s;oldiers, &s;carce any ve&s;tiges remain. It is &s;aid, the Moors de&s;troyed it, not to have a rival &s;o near Seville. The amphitheatre is now more like Stonehenge than a regular Roman edifice.</P>
<P>About four leagues from this city is a &s;mall tower, called <HI>La Torre de Quatro Abitas,</HI> which may be &s;haken by a per&s;on who a&s;cends it, to &s;uch a degree as to &s;pill liquids out of a gla&s;s; and <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> from whom this extract is made, farther &s;ays, he has been a&s;&s;ured, that all along the coa&s;ts of Spain are watch-towers, from mile to mile, with lights and guards at night, &s;o that from Cadiz to Barcelona, and from Bilboa to Ferrol, the whole kingdom may,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
by the&s;e means, be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively alarmed in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The country round the city, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, lies &s;o low that it is frequently overflowed; and upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the water has been eight feet high even in their habitations. The &s;oil is rich, and being at the &s;ame time very deep, its fertility is a&s;toni&s;hing. The produce is corn, legu|minous plants, hemp, flax, lemons, oranges, and liquorice. The quantity of liquorice exported an|nually from Spain, is &s;aid to amount nearly to 200 tons, a con&s;iderable part of which is purcha&s;ed by the porter-brewers in London. The importation of this produce from Spain has increa&s;ed very rapid|ly within the&s;e few years. From being only three tons in the year 1785, it became 60 tons in the year 1788, into the port of London only, and 183 tons including the outports. From which circum&s;tance we may collect, that London has taught the country brewers the u&s;e of this innocent drug in making porter.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of vapours and <HI>mia&s;mata</HI> from &s;tanding waters, and frequent floods, the inhabi|tants of Seville and its neighourhood are &s;ubject to tertian and putrid fevers, and to hy&s;terical di&s;orders. The&s;e di&s;orders may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by the quantity of melons and cucumbers con&s;umed by them all the year, in con&s;equence of which they
<PB N="172" REF="173">
are likewi&s;e infe&s;ted with worms, accompanied with epilep&s;ies. There are other di&s;ea&s;es, which origi|nate in heat. Whenever they have the <HI>Solano</HI> wind, that is, whenever the wind blows from Africa, they become liable to pleuri&s;ies; but what is chiefly complained of by the phy&s;icians and magi&s;trates is, an irritability of nerves, influencing the morals in a variety of ways.</P>
<P>A. D. 1731, the con&s;umption of fle&s;h in Seville was 1,792,271 lbs. of which the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had 8,11,091 lbs. free from taxes.</P>
<P>Cadiz, or, as the Engli&s;h generally pronounce is Cales, was not le&s;s famous in antiquity, than when it became the &s;taple of general commerce from Spain to the Indies.</P>
<P>The Phoenicians had no &s;ooner landed in Spain than they founded a city, which they named <HI>Gadez</HI> (or enclo&s;ure) upon that tongue of land which the Greeks believed to be the we&s;tern extremity of the world.</P>
<P>This place became very powerful under the em|pire of the Romans. They embelli&s;hed it with &s;e|veral temples; and, if the ancients may be believ|ed, the ceremonies and dogmas of religion had there a more &s;ublime meaning than in the re&s;t of the
<PB N="173" REF="174">
world. Altars were dedicated to the year, the month, to commerce, and, what is &s;till more &s;ur|prizing, Gadez contained the &s;tatue and temple of Poverty. The temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> built by the Phoenicians, in this city, was the mo&s;t famous; it was here he vanqui&s;hed the triple Geryon. The great antiquity of the temple gave ri&s;e to fa|bulous tales. Among the numerous columns with which it was decorated, were two of bra&s;s, upon which unknown characters were engraved. According to the Roman hi&s;torians it was near this place <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> found the &s;tatue of <HI>Alexander,</HI> which in&s;pired his ambition with &s;uch bitter complaints. No &s;acrifice of animals was made in this temple: nothing but incen&s;e was burned within the walls; and, by an in&s;titution not remarkable for politene&s;s, and difficult to be explained, women and &s;wine were forbidden to enter it. The prie&s;t who offered up the &s;acrifice was to be cha&s;te, to have his head &s;haved, his feet bare, and his robe tucked up. Some authors pretend that there was no &s;tatue in the temple, not even that of the divinity to which it was dedicated. By <HI>Hercules</HI> the Phoeni|cians meant to indicate the almighty power of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>It is recorded by &s;ome old French writers that, during the time of the Romans, 'their great riches
<PB N="174" REF="175">
had introduced &s;uch luxury, that the girls of Gades, were &s;ought after in all public rejoicings, as well for their &s;kill in playing on different in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, <HI>que pour leur humeur, qui avoit quelque cho&s;e de plus que de l'enjouement.'</HI></P>
<P>The &s;mall penin&s;ula on which Cadiz is &s;ituated embraces a very con&s;iderable extent of the &s;ea; and, with its two extreme points, called <HI>Los Puntales,</HI> forms a noble bay, the work of nature, which is about three leagues long, and two broad. Its en|trance is in breadth a &s;hort league. The two points appear contrived expre&s;sly to defend the bay.</P>
<P>Cadiz occupies the whole &s;urface of the we&s;tern extremity of the i&s;le of Leon. This i&s;land bears re&s;emblance to a pear with a long &s;talk; and is in length, from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t, about &s;ix leagues. The north-we&s;t end, where the town &s;tands, is &s;carcely half a league in breadth. At the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the ancient bridge of Sua|co, thrown over a deep channel or river, affords a communication between the i&s;land and the conti|nent.</P>
<P>The i&s;land, with the continent oppo&s;ite to it, forms a bay four leagues in lenght, and in mo&s;t places
<PB N="175" REF="176">
two in breadth, except about the centre of the bay, where are two points of land which approach &s;o near as to command the pa&s;&s;age. One of the&s;e points is on the i&s;land and the other on the conti|nent. Within the&s;e points of land is the harbour. Two forts are erected on them, Fort Puntal and Fort Matagorda, which mu&s;t be taken before an ene|my can enter the harbour; the&s;e two forts are well fortified, and render the harbour perfectly &s;ecure. During the time of the ebb a great part of the har|bour is dry.</P>
<P>The bay is &s;o &s;pacious, that there are moorings for the different ve&s;&s;els, according to their various de&s;tinations.</P>
<P>Cadiz is &s;urrounded with walls, which contribute more to its embelli&s;hment than to its defence.</P>
<P>Cadiz contains &s;everal regular &s;quares, the &s;treets are broad, &s;traight, and at pre&s;ent almo&s;t all paved with a large white and &s;mooth &s;tone, in which care has been taken to cut it in &s;uch a manner as to pre|vent the hor&s;es and mules from &s;lipping.</P>
<P>The &s;warms of rats that run about the &s;treets in the night are incredible; whole droves of them pa&s;s and repa&s;s continually, which makes walking late in the &s;treets extremely trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177">The hou&s;es are very high, with each a ve&s;tibule, which being left open till night, &s;erves pa&s;&s;engers to retire to: this cu&s;tom, which prevails throughout Spain, renders the&s;e places exceedingly offen&s;ive. In the middle of the hou&s;e is a court like a deep well, under which is generally a ci&s;tern, the breed|ing place of gnats and mo&s;quitos; the ground-floors are warehou&s;es, the fir&s;t &s;tories compting hou&s;es or kitchens, and the principal apartments up two pair of &s;tairs. The roofs are flat, covered with an im|penetrable cement, and few are without a <HI>mirador</HI> or turret, for the purpo&s;e of commanding a view of the &s;ea. Round the parapet wall are placed rows of &s;quare pillars, intended either for ornament, agreeable to &s;ome traditional mode of decoration, or to fix awnings to; that &s;uch as &s;it there for the benefit of the &s;ea breeze may be &s;heltered from the rays of the &s;un: but the mo&s;t common u&s;e made of them, is to fa&s;ten ropes for drying linen upon. High above all the&s;e pinnacles, which gives Cadiz a mo&s;t &s;ingular appearance, &s;tands the tower of &s;ignals: here flags are hung out on the fir&s;t &s;ight of a &s;ail, marking the &s;ize of the &s;hip, the nation it belongs to, and, if a Spani&s;h Indiaman, the port of the Indies it come from.</P>
<P>The public walk or alameda is plea&s;ant in the evening: it is cu&s;tomary to walk here till midnight. Among the re&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s,</HI> I ob&s;erved &s;everal ladies
<PB N="177" REF="178">
who had fixed glow-worms by threads to their hair, which had a luminous and plea&s;ing effect. The alameda is planted with double rows of white elms; &s;eats of &s;tone are fixed on each &s;ides: it is parted from the coach-road by iron rails, and commands a fine view of the ocean. This walk is as much re&s;orted to by ladies of ea&s;y virtue as our St. James's park, and is the only place in Spain where &s;uch bare-faced licentiou&s;ne&s;s and libertini&s;m is to be &s;een.</P>
<P>At the extremity of this walk, we&s;tward, is a large e&s;planade, the only airing place in this city: it turns round mo&s;t of the we&s;t and &s;outh &s;ides of the i&s;land, but the buildings are &s;traggling and ugly.</P>
<P>They reckon now in Cadiz not more than 70,000 inhabitants; but, about ten years &s;ince, it is &s;aid to have contained near 90,000, be&s;ides 20,000 that entered daily from the &s;ea and the adjacent country.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed buildings are the two cathedrals, the one ancient, the other not yet fini&s;hed. The former is chiefly worthy of notice for &s;ome good pictures and its trea&s;ures, con&s;i&s;ting of gems, &s;ilver candle&s;ticks and lamps, both nu|merous and bulky; and three cu&s;todias or taber|nacles,
<PB N="178" REF="179">
one of which con&s;tructed of the fine&s;t &s;ilver, and weighs more than half a ton; another is mo&s;tly of &s;olid gold.</P>
<P>The new cathedral is an immen&s;e pile, with large and lofty domes, and many pillars well proportion|ed; yet the whole appears heavy and di&s;gu&s;ting. This is attributed to its being loaded with a very projecting cornice, which in a rotunda of large di|men&s;ions would not be void of elegance, but is by no means &s;uitable to an edifice abounding with angles. All who view this building are &s;truck with the ab&s;urdity of this prepo&s;terous ornament. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, however, that the waves may &s;oon wipe away this di&s;grace to ta&s;te, as they have al|ready begun their deva&s;tations on that &s;ide, and not more than ten feet are interpo&s;ed between the build|ing and the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In the convents are &s;ome good pictures, more particularly in the cloi&s;ter of the Augu&s;tine friars; and in that of the Capuchins, are &s;ome mo&s;t worthy of attention, by <HI>Murillo.</HI></P>
<P>Of the three ho&s;pitals, two are remarkable for their neatne&s;s; the third de&s;erves mo&s;t commenda|tion for its general utility. It is called the Royal or Military Ho&s;pital, becau&s;e de&s;igned for &s;oldiers; it has four&s;core &s;tudents maintained and educated
<PB N="179" REF="180">
at the King's expence. One of the two di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for neatne&s;s is &s;et apart for women; the other, de&s;igned for men, is elegant. All the wards are paved with marble, in checkers of black and white; and, in&s;tead of white walls, wain&s;coting, or &s;tucco, the &s;ides are covered with Dutch tiles.</P>
<P>In this ho&s;pital are generally about 6000 pa|tients, and out of the&s;e they annually lo&s;e one tenth.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a retreat for widows, founded by a Turkey merchant, &s;ettled at Cadiz, who died A. D. 1756, aged 104. In this ho&s;pital 47 widows have each two good rooms, with a weekly allow|ance of &s;ix reals. But the mo&s;t intere&s;ting e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in Cadiz, and the be&s;t conducted of the kind in Spain, is the <HI>ho&s;picio,</HI> or general hou&s;e of indu&s;try. In it are received the poor of every nation unable to maintain them&s;elves; and in the fir&s;t place, orphans, de&s;erted children, and the aged, who are pa&s;&s;ed the capability of labour, the blind, the lame, idiots, and mad people, but e&s;pe|cially prie&s;ts when aged and reduced to poverty. Even &s;trangers pa&s;&s;ing through the city, with per|mi&s;&s;ion of the governor, may be entertained here for two days.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">Neatne&s;s univer&s;ally prevails, and all who are here received are clean, well cloathed, and have plenty of the be&s;t provi&s;ions. The young people are taught to read, to write, to ca&s;t accounts; and &s;uch as manife&s;t abilities, are not only in&s;tructed in the principles of geometry, but, if they are &s;o inclined, are taught to draw. The boys are trained to weav|ing, and to various crafts; the girls &s;pin wool, flax and cotton; they knit, make lace, or are employed in plain work.</P>
<P>To encourage indu&s;try an account is kept of what every individual earns, out of which he is made debtor to the hou&s;e for about three reals a day, and the overplus given to him, when he can make it appear he is able to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf without their future aid. I examined the accounts of many, &s;ays <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> who cleared for them&s;elves more than half a crown a week, and were looking out for &s;et|tlements, that they might marry, and gather the fruits of their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the hou&s;e is a &s;pacious &s;hop, for the accommodation of all who are willing to work, wherein are provided proper implements and raw materials, and the moment any one has completed his work, he receives the price of his labour with|out any deduction; being at liberty not only to
<PB N="181" REF="182">
lodge where he plea&s;es, but to &s;pend his gains ac|cording to his own fancy.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e many, who would work, are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly confined at home, where from poverty they are unable to procure either wheels or wool, the governors provide both, and pay them without any deduction for their work. <HI>Town&s;end</HI> in&s;tances three children employed by them, the elde&s;t nine years of age, who by &s;pinning gained &s;ix reals, that is more than 14 pence a day, and maintained a pa|ralytic father.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with the&s;e exertions they have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;chools, in the di&s;tant quarters of the city, and, providing ma&s;ters in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, freely admit all who are de&s;irous of being taught.</P>
<P>The management is ve&s;ted in 12 directors, who are pre&s;ided over by the governor of the city, for the time being, with power to fill up of them&s;elves any vacancy which may happen in their body.</P>
<P>The &s;ource of their revenue are from voluntary contributions, legacies, a tax on all wheat brought into the city, and from the produce of labour in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">The agreeable and amiable qualities of the fair &s;ex renders a re&s;idence at Cadiz delightful, the ladies po&s;&s;e&s;s to a very uncommon degree the plea&s;|ing exterior of the Andalu&s;ians, modified by the &s;ociety of &s;trangers, and by that general de&s;ire to plea&s;e, which the refinements of &s;ociety and a con|cour&s;e of admirers maintain in continual activity. Plea&s;ures are not much varied at Cadiz. During &s;ome years there was a French comedy. The only theatre at pre&s;ent is the national one, which rivals tho&s;e of the capital, and &s;ometimes is enriched by their lo&s;&s;es. The &s;ituation of the city, but of a middling extent for a population of 80,000 inha|bitants, and which the &s;ea almo&s;t &s;urrounds, renders the plea&s;ures of public walks but very few. At a quarter of a league from the land-gate, &s;terility again appears, and continues for &s;everal leagues round, if a few kitchen-gardens and &s;ome orchards, in the vicinity of the i&s;le of Leon, be excepted, where waterings &s;upply the want of moi&s;ture in the &s;andy dryne&s;s of the &s;oil. The bull-fights are ex|hibited in the hotte&s;t months of the year; this being one of the few cities in Spain where they have not been bani&s;hed, and it is not that in which the people are lea&s;t delighted with them.</P>
<P>They have an Italian Opera, and a French Thea|tre, upon a very grand &s;cale, &s;upported by the vo|luntary &s;ub&s;criptions of the French merchants.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">The end of the carnival at Cadiz differs very little from the beginning; no public balls or ma&s;|querades being allowed; the only marks of the fe&s;|tivity of Shrove-tide, the la&s;t day of the carnival, were pail-fulls of water which the women in the balconies poured upon the men in &s;louched hats and cloaks that pa&s;&s;ed within their reach. There were, however, many a&s;&s;emblies and balls of a lower cla&s;s, where the fandango was danced <HI>a la ley,</HI> that is in all the perfection it is capable of. Among the gip&s;ies there is another dance called the <HI>Man|guindoy,</HI> &s;o la&s;civious and indecent that it is pro|hibited under &s;evere penalties; the turns are &s;imple, like that of the fandango, being little more than a return of the &s;ame &s;et of notes; this, as well as the fandango, is &s;aid to have been imported from the Havannah, being both of negro breed. On the coa&s;t of Africa it is likewi&s;e &s;aid they exhibit a variety of &s;trange dances, pretty &s;imilar to the&s;e. From whatever country the fandango may have ori|ginally come, it is now &s;o thoroughly naturalized in Spain, that every Spaniard may be &s;aid to have been born with it in his head and his heels. Towards the clo&s;e of the great balls, given heretofore in the theatre, when all the company appeared drooping with fatigue, it was a con&s;tant trick of the fiddlers to &s;trike up this dance. In an in&s;tant every one &s;tarted up, and the whole hou&s;e re&s;ounded with the
<PB N="184" REF="185">
uproar of clapping hands, footing, jumping, and &s;napping of fingers.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t commercial city in Spain, the fir&s;t marine department, and the centre of all the traffic to America and the We&s;t Indies. Cadiz, &s;ays the author of the <HI>Voyageur Fran&ccedil;ais,</HI> in his ac|count of the trade of this city, is the place where the Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, and Italian merchants &s;end their goods to be exported to America in Spa|ni&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which are divided into three cla&s;&s;es; the fleet, <HI>(flota,)</HI> the regi&s;ter &s;hips, and the galleons. The <HI>flota</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of three men of war, and 14 or 15 merchant &s;hips, who&s;e burthen is from 400 to 1000 tons. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are laden with the be&s;t European productions; &s;ilk, &s;tuffs, linen, velvet, ribbonds, laces, gla&s;s, paper, hardware, watches, clocks, &s;hoes, &s;tockings, books, prints, pictures, iron uten&s;ils, wine, fruit, &amp;c. &s;o that every nation is in|tere&s;ted in the lading. Spain hardly contributes any thing but wine, which with the freight, broker, age, and taxes to the King, are all the advantages &s;he derives from this commerce. The fleet &s;ails from Cadiz to La Vera Cruz, the ve&s;&s;els which compo&s;e it are not allowed to part company, nor to put in, nor break bulk any where on the voy|age. It takes in return gold, &s;ilver, jewels, cochi|neal, indigo, tobacco, &s;ugar, coton, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">The regi&s;ter &s;hips are equipped by, and &s;ail for the account of &s;ome private merchants of Seville and Cadiz. When they think the Americans are in want of certain goods, they pre&s;ent a petition to the council of the Indies, and de&s;ire leave to &s;end each of them a ve&s;&s;el of 300 tons, for which leave they pay a certain &s;um; and, be&s;ides, are obliged to make con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to different officers; and though they only obtain leave to &s;end ve&s;&s;els of 300 tons, they generally &s;end tho&s;e of at lea&s;t double that burthen.</P>
<P>The galleon fleet is compo&s;ed of eight &s;hips of the line, chiefly de&s;tined to furni&s;h Peru with war|like &s;tores, but they are al&s;o filled with various merchandi&s;e for the account of private per&s;ons. Twelve other ve&s;&s;els, &s;ail under their convoy. This fleet may only trade on the coa&s;ts of the South Sea, and the other is limited to Mexico.</P>
<P>The whole trade of Cadiz engages about 1000 ve&s;&s;els, of which nearly one-tenth are Spani&s;h.</P>
<P>The wines mo&s;t remarkable in Cadiz, are Sherry and Pacaretti, both from Xeres and its vicinity. The former is &s;old for 48 pounds a ton, the latter for 56; when they come to England, they pay in the out ports exci&s;e and cu&s;toms, near 30 pounds a
<PB N="186" REF="187">
ton, but in the port of London near three pounds more.</P>
<P>The people who mo&s;t abound at Cadiz are, fir&s;t the Iri&s;h, and next the Flemings, Genoe&s;e, and Germans. The Engli&s;h and Dutch are not numer|ous. There are many Frenchmen, but more among the workmen of every kind, and retail dealers, than among the merchants. It appears, however, that the commerce carried on by foreigners in this city, is very much on the decline. This is attributed chiefly to the exten&s;ion of the commerce of the Spani&s;h Indies, formerly confined to this city, and to &s;everal other ports of the kingdom of Spain.</P>
<P>The manufactures of this city are very incon&s;i|derable: that of &s;alt is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting branch of indu&s;try. The &s;alt-pits encompa&s;s a great part of the bay from Puntal to Port St. Mary. The &s;alt manufactures &s;ell what remains to them after fur|ni&s;hing the King's magazines, more or le&s;s dear according to circum&s;tances. The nations who purcha&s;e it are Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Eng|land, and particularly Portugal. The fi&s;hermen from St. Malo, Dieppe, and Granville, &s;ometimes go to the Bay of Cadiz to take in cargoes of &s;alt for Newfoundland; and when the &s;alt-pits in France fail, the French take large quantities of it for home con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">Every commercial nation has a con&s;ul re&s;ident at Cadiz; tho&s;e of England are the only ones not al|lowed to have any concern in trade.</P>
<P>The &s;tir in this city is prodigious during the la&s;t months of the &s;tay of the flota. The packers po&s;&s;e&s;s the art of pre&s;&s;ing goods in great perfection; but as the freight is paid according to the cubic palms of each bale, they are apt to &s;queeze down the cloths and linen &s;o very clo&s;e and hard, as &s;ometimes to ren|der them unfit for u&s;e. The exportation of French luxuries in dre&s;s is enormous; Lyons furni&s;hes mo&s;t of them; England &s;ends out bale good; and the North, linens.</P>
<P>At about four leagues from Cadiz is Chiclana, a hand&s;ome village, where the merchants of Cadiz have their country hou&s;es. The&s;e they have em|belli&s;hed and &s;urrounded with that verdure of which they are deprived in their town re&s;idence. The citizens of Cadiz carry thither, and enjoy, for a time, all the luxuries of the capital; dinners, &s;up|pers, balls, concerts, all the di&s;play of opulence, and every ornament of the toilette; this village is, if we may &s;o expre&s;s it, a theatre opened by luxury and ta&s;te; in which the polite and amiable di&s;play their charms, &s;mooth the brows of the calculators who accompany them, and generou&s;ly be&s;towing
<PB N="188" REF="189">
unnumbered plea&s;ures, oblige them to confe&s;s that there are things more precious than gold.</P>
<P>GIBRALTAR. This town, which has been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h &s;ince the year 1704, is &s;eated at the foot of the famous mount Calpe, generally known by the name of one of Hercules's pillars, the other being mount Abyle, directly oppo&s;ite to it on the African coa&s;t. Mount Calpe is a high and &s;teep rock, &s;tanding by it&s;elf and joined to the Spani&s;h continent by means of a low neck of land, about two hundred fathoms broad. The town of Gibral|tar is built on a &s;lip of land, which runs out into the Mediterranean &s;ea, and forms a bay called the bay of Gibraltar. The mountain, or rock which defends it on the land &s;ide is half a league high, and &s;o &s;teep that there is no a&s;cending it by a body of troops if they met with oppo&s;ition. Its perpendicular height above the level of the &s;ea, is fourteen hundred feet. Many apes and monkies inhabit its caverns and pre|cipices, and are frequently &s;hot; it is thought that the&s;e animals are not produced in any other part of Europe. The birds called &s;olitary &s;parrows, are al&s;o found here.</P>
<P>In blowing up the rock in various places, many pieces of bones, teeth, &amp;c. are daily found incorpora|ted with the &s;tones. On the we&s;t &s;ide of this moun|tain, is the cave called S. Michaels, eleven hundred
<PB N="189" REF="190">
and ten feet above the horizon. It contains many pillars of various &s;izes, from the thickne&s;s of a goo&s;e's quill to two feet in diameter, formed by the drop|pings of water, which have petrified in falling. The water is perpetually dripping from the roof, and forms an infinite number of <HI>&s;talactitae,</HI> continually increa&s;ing in bulk, which will probably, in proce&s;s of time, fill the whole cavern. At the end of this cave is a hole, about &s;ix feet in diameter, of which the depth is uncertain. The &s;ignal hou&s;e, built on the highe&s;t part of the mountain, commands a pro&s;pect of the town, the bay, the &s;traits. Mount Abyle, or Ape's hill, on the African &s;hore, the city of Ceuta, and great part of the Barbary coa&s;t; the town of S. Roque and Algeziras, and the &s;nowy Alpuxarra mountains. At night an infinitely greater number of &s;tars maybe di&s;covered from hence by the naked eye than from below, becau&s;e in this elevated &s;itua|tion the atmo&s;phere is much more pure and thin.</P>
<P>Gibraltar is not &s;o con&s;iderable for extent or beauty, as for its &s;trength or &s;ituation, which renders it the key of Spain. It is accordingly provided with all the artillery, &s;tores, and forces nece&s;&s;ary for its defence. Seven regiments generally are in garri&s;on here, and &s;ix hundred men are always on guard at a time. The di&s;cipline ob&s;erved here is very &s;trict, and the officers always appear in their regimentals. There are 340 guns mounted on the fortifications,
<PB N="190" REF="191">
and there is room for 100 more; tho&s;e of the grand battery are of bronze, and the re&s;t of iron, they are all fired in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on the king's birth-day; this performance takes up half an hour. At &s;un-ri&s;e, &s;un-&s;et, and at nine in the evening a gun is daily fired.</P>
<P>In the year 1704, the united fleets of England and Holland, after a cannonading of only a few hours, took it by &s;urrender; and though the Spaniards endeavoured to recover it the following year, by a formal &s;iege, and afterwards by a block|ade, they mi&s;carried in both; and at the Treaty of Utrecht the Engli&s;h were confirmed in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. In the year 1727 the Spaniards again attempted Gibraltar, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before. A fre&s;h attempt was likewi&s;e made on the &s;ide of the town during the late war, by the means of floating batteries, which likewi&s;e failed. This la&s;t attempt would have proved &s;uc|ce&s;sful, had it not been for the &s;tratagem of firing red hot balls on them from the garri&s;on, which &s;et fire to the greate&s;t part of the new invented batteries, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h lines are a fortification, running acro&s;s the i&s;thmus which &s;eparates Gibraltar from the continent. A regiment of infantry, &s;everal batteries, and a fort at each end, defend this

barrier of the Spani&s;h monarchy. It is about half an hour's ride from the land-gate of the Engli&s;h garri&s;on.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t extraordinary fortre&s;s and mountain has been &s;o often de&s;cribed by particular hi&s;tories, prints, and drawings, that we have given a view of it.</P>
<P>The views publi&s;hed by <HI>Major Mac&eacute;</HI> are exact, and convey a very good idea of the four different faces of the mountain. Since the time of their pub|lication <HI>General Boyd</HI> has completed the roads up the hill in every nece&s;&s;ary direction: a carriage may now go up to the &s;ignal-hou&s;e, which be|fore &s;eemed a place where none but goats could climb up.</P>
<P>The &s;trait to which this town gives name is about eight leagues in length and five in breadth. There is a &s;trong current &s;etting into this &s;trait from the Atlantic, which will carry a ve&s;&s;el ten miles an hour, and requires a very &s;trong gale to &s;tem it.</P>
<P>The town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one &s;treet, which is tolerably broad and well paved; the other &s;treets are crooked, narrow, and dirty: it contains an Engli&s;h church, a Roman Catholic one for the Spaniards and Portugue&s;e, who inhabit this town,
<PB N="192" REF="194">
to the number of 300, and are mo&s;tly &s;hopkeepers, and for about 700 Genoe&s;e, chiefly mariners; and a &s;ynagogue for the Jews, who amount nearly to the number of 600. The number of the Engli&s;h may be about 2000, exclu&s;ive of the military: be&s;ides the&s;e, there are a few hundred Moors, who continually pa&s;s and repa&s;s to and from the Barbary coa&s;t, trafficking in cattle, fowls, fi&s;h, fruits, and other provi&s;ions, as nothing is to be had from Spain, which neither Jews nor Moors are ever &s;uffered to enter.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall theatre here, where the per|formances are well got up; the actors are mili|tary gentlemen, and the actre&s;&s;es &s;uch by profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>All European coin are current here, but con&s;i|derably under the value; a guinea pa&s;&s;ing for no more than 19 &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, and five Spani&s;h reals for not more than three.</P>
<P>No per&s;on is allowed to go out of the Engli&s;h territory, either by land or &s;ea, without a pa&s;s from the Governor, who grants the inhabitants one an|nually. No ve&s;&s;els, nor even boats, are &s;uffered to land their people in any of the Spani&s;h po&s;ts, till after they have performed a quarantine of three or four days. Here are taverns, coffee-hou&s;es, billiard-tables,
<PB N="193" REF="195">
&s;hops, &amp;c. as in England. The Gover|nor's garden is open to the public, and much re|&s;orted to on Sunday evenings.</P>
<P>The province of Andalu&s;ia, watered throughout its whole extent by the Guadalquivir, if properly cultivated, would produce corn &s;ufficient not only for its own con&s;umption but for exportation. Yet the wheat annually imported is little le&s;s than one million and an half of fanegas; the fanega being generally one cwt. but at Cadiz &s;omething le&s;s. Nearly one half of this quantity, in the year 1787, came from Africa, and the remainder, except about 85,000 fanegas, imported from America, was fur|ni&s;hed by Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia. In Cadiz, to prevent a &s;carcity of corn, and to make a profit by the &s;ale of it, the city has e&s;tabli&s;hed a public granary, from which the bakers are &s;upplied at a given price, and according to that the magi&s;trates regulate the a&s;&s;ize of bread.</P>
<P>The country between Cadiz and Alge&s;iras, which lies on the bay of Gibraltar, is one of the mo&s;t de|&s;ert of tho&s;e not quite uncultivated. "For ten leagues (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) I cro&s;&s;ed the duchy of Medina-Sidonia, which, in this di&s;trict, con&s;i&s;ted of corn-fields and pa&s;tures. In no part of them was the ve&s;tige of a human habitation. The great pro|prietor &s;eems to reign there like the lion in the fo|re&s;ts,

On &s;eeing them free from the yoke and bridle, wan|dering over an immen&s;e region, unbounded to the eye by barrier or enclo&s;ure, we were ready to ima|gine our&s;elves in the fir&s;t ages of the world, when animals in a &s;tate of independence divided with man the dominion of the earth, found every where their own property, and were not that of any per|&s;on. This province has been divided into great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as far back as the conque&s;t of it by the Moors. The principal Ca&s;tillian noblemen who then accompanied the conquering kings obtained enormous grants in perpetuity, according to the fatal cu&s;tom introduced into almo&s;t the whole of the monarchy. The extinction of males in the great families encrea&s;ed the inconvenience. Rich heire&s;|&s;es carry with them their opulent portions into fa|milies not le&s;s opulent, &s;o that this ab&s;urd &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is become, if we may &s;o expre&s;s it, a va&s;t tontine, which will &s;ooner or later make the greate&s;t part of Spain the inheritance of a few families, who &s;hall &s;urvive the re&s;t."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Con&s;titution and Government.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now gone through the different pro|vinces and cities, and given an account of their ancient and pre&s;ent &s;tate, their manners, cu&s;toms, trade, manufactures, and other local circum&s;tances,
<PB N="196" REF="199">
we &s;hall proceed to treat of the kingdom in gene|ral, as to its con&s;titution, government, laws, reve|nues, forces, literature, religion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to its con&s;titution. Spain, from Gothic times to that of <HI>Pelagius</HI> was an elective kingdom; and, for two centuries after him, the throne was filled by the &s;uffrages of the &s;tates, who departed, however, in no in&s;tance from the royal family; but from <HI>Ramir I.</HI> to <HI>Alphon&s;o V.</HI> all the concern the &s;tates had in the creation of a new king was to acknowledge him as a lawful and worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and &s;ince the latter, there appears not the lea&s;t trace of an election, the crown always, of cour&s;e, without any form or ceremony, devolving to the neare&s;t in blood. The kings of Spain have &s;ometimes limited the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to certain families, ranks, and per&s;ons; of which the fir&s;t in&s;tance was <HI>Philip III.</HI> in the year 1619; and the &s;econd, <HI>Philip V.</HI> in 1713. Females here are al&s;o capable of inheriting the crown, on failure of the male line. In ca&s;e of a total extinction of the royal family, it is an uncontroverted per&s;ua&s;ion, that the right of electing a king would revert to the people. If the next heir be incapable of government, and e&s;pe|cially if, on the decea&s;e of the king, affairs are in confu&s;ion, the &s;tates are empowered to chu&s;e five per&s;ons to take the admini&s;tration upon them,
<PB N="197" REF="200">
among whom the queen-mother is to hold the chief place.</P>
<P>The King's title at large runs thus: <HI>Ferdinand, by the Grace of God, King of</HI> Ca&s;tille, Leon, Arragon, <HI>the two</HI> Sicilies, Jeru&s;alem, Navarre, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Gallicia, Majorca, Seville, <HI>Cerdena,</HI> Cor|dova, Cor&s;ica, Murcia, Jaen, <HI>the</HI> Algarves <HI>of</HI> Al|ge&s;iras, Gibraltar, <HI>the</HI> Canary I&s;lands, <HI>the</HI> Ea&s;t <HI>and</HI> We&s;t Indies, <HI>the I&s;lands and Continent of the Ocean, Archduke of</HI> Au&s;tria, <HI>Duke of</HI> Burgundy, Brabant, <HI>and</HI> Milan, <HI>of</HI> Hab&s;burg, Flanders, Tirol, <HI>and</HI> Bar|celona, <HI>Lord of</HI> Bi&s;cay, <HI>and</HI> Molina, &amp;c. The &s;hort title is <HI>Rey Catholico de E&s;panna.</HI> This title of Catholic King, though before a&s;&s;umed by &s;ome kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> and other &s;overeigns, was, in 1500, &s;olemnly conferred on <HI>Ferdinand V.</HI> by Pope <HI>Alex|ander VI.</HI> Since the year 1308, the Hereditary Prince is &s;tyled Prince of the <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> but becomes &s;o always by creation. The other royal children are called Infantes.</P>
<P>The King's power is unlimited, and the &s;tates of the kingdom con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, the ancient no|bility, and the deputies of the towns. Since the beginning of the 17th century, or the time of <HI>Philip III.</HI> the <HI>Cortes</HI> or <HI>Dyets</HI> have been di&s;|continued, no other a&s;&s;embly than conventions of the deputies, or agents of the towns, having been
<PB N="198" REF="201">
thought nece&s;&s;ary; in which are &s;ettled the nece&s;|&s;ary taxes and impo&s;ts, without any infringements on the privileges of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics and nobility, whom unque&s;tionably the King &s;ummoned to tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies when the public good required it.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Spain, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> &s;ufficiently proves how great an influence the Cortes had for|merly in the mo&s;t important affairs of government. The&s;e for a long time have not been a&s;&s;embled, except for the &s;ake of form. And the &s;overeigns without violence, or formally rejecting their inter|vention, have found means to elude their authority. They promulgate from the throne ordinances, under the name of <HI>Pragmatiques,</HI> the preambles of which gives us to under&s;tand, that they claim the &s;ame authority as if they had been publi&s;hed in the a&s;|&s;embly of the Cortes; which are never convoked except at the acce&s;&s;ion of a new &s;overeign to the throne, to admini&s;ter to him an oath in the name of the nation, and to &s;wear to him fidelity.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion letters of convocation are &s;ent to all the grandees, to all per&s;ons bearing titles of Ca&s;tille, (an honorary di&s;tinction,) to all the pre|lates, and to every city which has a right to &s;end deputies to the Cortes. The fir&s;t two cla&s;&s;es repre|&s;ent the nobility, the bi&s;hops &s;it in the name of the clergy, and the cities, which depute one of their
<PB N="199" REF="202">
magi&s;trates, repre&s;ent the people. Except on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the Cortes of the whole kingdom have not been a&s;&s;embled, &s;ince <HI>Philip V.</HI> convoked them to give their approbation to the Pragmatic Sanction, for changing the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>They are &s;till con&s;ulted for form's &s;ake, in cer|tain ca&s;es; but then the members of which they are compo&s;ed, corre&s;pond with each other, without a&s;&s;embling. A faint image of them, however, re|mains in an a&s;&s;embly, which con&s;tantly re&s;ides at Madrid, under the name of <HI>Diputados de los Reynos,</HI> or Deputies of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>At their breaking up, when convoked by <HI>Philip V.</HI> it was agreed that they &s;hould be repre&s;ented by a permanent committee, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hould be to watch over the admini&s;tration of that part of the taxes, known by the name of <HI>Millones,</HI> and which had been granted under <HI>Philip VI.</HI> with the formal con&s;ent of the Cortes, upon certain conditions, which that monarch &s;wore to ob&s;erve. They re|tained the admini&s;tration of the&s;e impo&s;ts till the year 1718, when Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> who&s;e ardent and impetuous genius was irritated at &s;uch &s;hackles, transferred the admini&s;tration of it into the hands of the Sovereign. From that time the a&s;&s;embly of de|puties of the kingdom have held no more of the &s;tate revenues, than the &s;mall portion nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="200" REF="203">
pay the &s;alaries, and defray the expences of the members. The&s;e deputies are only eight in num|ber, and are cho&s;en according to the ancient divi|&s;ion of the provinces of the crown of Ca&s;tille, and tho&s;e of the crown of Arragon.</P>
<P>The&s;e two parts of the monarchy differ from each other, with re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration, form, and collection of taxes; a di&s;tinction which had its origin at the time when Ca&s;tille and Arragon were united by the marriage of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand, the Catholic,</HI> and which &s;ince that time has undergone but few alterations. All the provinces of Ca&s;tille unite to name &s;ix; Catalonia and Majorca, one; and the regencies of Valencia and Arragon elect the eighth. The&s;e deputies &s;it &s;ix years, at the expi|ration of which a new election takes place. As a relict of their ancient rights, they &s;till retain the privilege of being, by virtue of their places, mem|bers of the council of finance, by which the &s;ove|reign communicates to the nation the nece&s;&s;ity of levying any new tax; and the approbation they are &s;uppo&s;ed to give to the royal re&s;olution, is a &s;hadow of the con&s;ent of the Cortes, without which taxes could not formerly be either levied or augmented. The provinces of Bi&s;cay and Navarre, which have a&s;&s;emblies, and particular privileges, &s;end al&s;o on &s;ome occa&s;ions, deputies to the throne, but they do not make a part of the body of deputies of the
<PB N="201" REF="204">
kingdom, and their con&s;tituents fix, at plea&s;ure, the object and duration of their temporary mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From this &s;ketch of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, we may perceive how little the Sovereign authority is limited in Spain. How feeble mu&s;t that rampart of liberty be, which is only formed of a &s;mall num|ber of citizens, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but of little real power, under the controul of government, from whom they expect favours and preferments, and who, after all, repre&s;ent only the people, the mo&s;t numerous, but the lea&s;t re&s;pected part of the nation! The will of the monarch is al&s;o carried into execution by &s;everal other permament bodies, under the name of councils, who are the interpreters and keepers of the law. But before we treat of the&s;e it will be pro|per to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the mini&s;ters who are con&s;tantly near the per&s;on of the Monarch, and with whom alone he at pre&s;ent &s;hares the weight of royalty. Their authority was formerly counter-balanced by the council of &s;tate, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and forms the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed body in the mo|narchy; but which, &s;ince the admini&s;tration of Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> has not been permitted to a&s;|&s;emble, and exerci&s;e its functions. The place of coun&s;ellor of &s;tate is, therefore, now, only honorary, with a con&s;iderable &s;alary annexed to it, and fur|ni&s;hes the Sovereign with the means of rewarding tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects who have de&s;erved well of the
<PB N="202" REF="205">
&s;tate, in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed employments. The want of this a&s;&s;embly of the coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, is now &s;upplied by the Sovereign's uniting the mi|ni&s;ters of the &s;ix principal departments into a com|mittee.</P>
<P>For the admini&s;tration of the kingdom is divided into &s;ix grand departments. The mini&s;ter of fo|reign affairs is, in many re&s;pects, the directing mini&s;ter, and receives, as a mark of di&s;tinction, the title of Secretary of State. The mini&s;ter of war has but a very circum&s;cribed authority. He is pre&s;ident of the council of war, which is rather a tribunal than a board of admini&s;tration. The in|&s;pectors of the different regiments, draw up a &s;tate|ment of whatever relates to the corps of which they have the direction, and the mini&s;ter at war has only to pre&s;ent the memorials they give in to the king.</P>
<P>The marine mini&s;ter has no a&s;&s;ociates. The chiefs of the three departments, and the in&s;pectors of the marine, are named by the King, on the repre|&s;entation of the mini&s;ter; the marine ordinances prepared by him, require only the &s;anction of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of finances who &s;hould properly be un|der the in&s;pection of the &s;uperintendant-general of that department, were &s;ome time &s;ince united, and
<PB N="203" REF="206">
will probably be &s;o continued. This mini&s;ter is be&s;ides, pre&s;ident of the council of finance.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of the Indies has the mo&s;t exten&s;ive department in all the monarchy, for in him is cen|tered the civil, military, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and financial government of Spani&s;h America; and it may be &s;aid, that in the whole political world there is no mini&s;ter who&s;e department comprehends &s;o many different objects. Had <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> committed to one &s;ingle mini&s;ter the government of the whole Roman Empire, his power would only have extended to a &s;mall part of modern Europe, the coa&s;ts of Africa, and &s;ome provinces of A&s;ia; for the Roman Em|pire, at the time it was mo&s;t exten&s;ive, was not to be compared to that immen&s;e country, which from the north of California, &s;tretches to the &s;traits of Magellan, and forms the dominions of the Spani&s;h monarch in America, and the department of the mini&s;ter of the Indies.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of <HI>Favour and Ju&s;tice,</HI> has his de|partment in the judiciary and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; but his authority is controuled by the great cham|ber of the council of Ca&s;tille, of which we &s;hall treat hereafter; and with re&s;pect to the nomination to benefices, by the intervention of the King's con|fe&s;&s;or. The latter, however, depends upon the will
<PB N="204" REF="207">
of the monarch, and the confidence with which he honours the director of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ix offices are u&s;ually filled by &s;ix different per&s;ons; but, until the year 1776, the &s;ame mini&s;|ter held tho&s;e of the marine and Indies, which are &s;o connected that the good of the nation will per|haps require them to be again united.</P>
<P>The &s;tability of mini&s;ters is one of the mo&s;t re|markable peculiarities of the court of Spain. The monarch who, in di&s;po&s;ing of the&s;e eminent places, con&s;ults public opinion, has hitherto had the &s;ingu|lar happine&s;s of his approbation never having been di&s;honoured by the event. For which rea&s;on his mini&s;ters, without abandoning them&s;elves to indo|lence, ardently labour to ju&s;tify his confidence, and lo&s;e not that time, which is to them &s;o precious, in watching the latent &s;prings of court intrigues, in order to di&s;concert their &s;ecret machinations. They have the courage to form va&s;t projects, know|ing that they are certain to find a con&s;tant &s;upport in the benevolence of the monarch. There is no|thing to divert them from an attention to the duties of their office. Plea&s;ures do not abound at the Spani&s;h court; there are no theatrical repre&s;enta|tions of any kind; the amu&s;ement of the Sovereign and the princes is confined to the chace. This, though a great inconvenience to the idlers about
<PB N="205" REF="208">
the court, is of un&s;peakable advantage to public affairs. Mini&s;ters may there dedicate the whole of their time to bu&s;ine&s;s and audiences. The &s;imple and regular life that they lead is greatly to be ad|mired: walking is almo&s;t the only amu&s;ement they permit them&s;elves. Their principal &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ts of their clerks, who habitually eat at their tables. This reciprocal con&s;traint has &s;ome inconveniences, but there re&s;ults from it a greater union between the heads and the &s;ubalterns in office, and more unanimity in the conduct of affairs. Tho&s;e who di&s;patch them under the eye of the mini&s;ter, are not, in fact, merely clerks; they may rather be compared to the principles of our offices. To be appointed to the&s;e places, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have given proofs of talents in &s;ome confidential employ|ments. There are no doubt abu&s;es in the public offices of the court of Spain, as well as in all others; but in general, corruption is very rare, and per&s;ons in office are polite and obliging. With re&s;pect to the mini&s;ters them&s;elves, nothing le&s;s than the e&s;teem of the nation, and the love of public good, can make them amends for &s;o entirely renouncing the greater part of the plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme royal council of Ca&s;tille, holds the fir&s;t rank among the councils and tribunals of the kingdom: it is at once a council of admini&s;tration, which has the in&s;pection of all the interior opera|tions
<PB N="206" REF="209">
of govonment, and a &s;overeign tribunal, that has exclu&s;ive cognizances of certain cau&s;es, and in certain ca&s;es receives appeals from the other tribu|nals. The olde&s;t members of this council, form what is called, in Spain, the <HI>Camara,</HI> which is pro|perly the privy council of the monarch; and, at the &s;ame time, a &s;overeign tribunal for certain cau&s;es, &s;uch as all which relate to the right of patronage; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons of the royal family; and all conte&s;ts relative to the rights of cities; <HI>civdades,</HI> which differ from <HI>villa,</HI> the former having a par|ticular juri&s;diction, and being repre&s;ented in the Cortes of the kingdom. Madrid, for example, is only a <HI>villa,</HI> yet is repre&s;ented in the Cortes, like the <HI>civdades.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Camara</HI> is al&s;o the council which i&s;&s;ues all acts or patents of royal favour. All places in the magi&s;tracy, and all con&s;i&s;torial benefices, are con|ferred by its means. It recommends to his Ma|je&s;ty, through the medium of his mini&s;ter of favour and ju&s;tice, three per&s;ons to fill them, and the King chu&s;es one of the three.</P>
<P>No place in the magi&s;tracy is venal in Spain. This, like all human in&s;titutions, has its advantage and inconvenience. If it leaves a greater opening to caprice, favour, and intrigue, it prevents the tribunals from being di&s;honoured by incapacity and
<PB N="207" REF="210">
ignorance, and dimini&s;hes the temptation to &s;ell that ju&s;tice of which the right of di&s;pen&s;ing it had been previou&s;ly purcha&s;ed. It is true, that the integrity of magi&s;trates, frequently without fortune, mu&s;t appear &s;u&s;picious, and that their moderate fees &s;eem but a weak barrier again&s;t corruption. How|ever, notwith&s;tanding the declamations of di&s;&s;atis|fied clients, iniquitous and partial judges are not more common in Spain than in other countries.</P>
<P>There is a kind of gradation in the Spani&s;h ma|gi&s;tracy, of which the degrees are ea&s;ily traced. All the members of the <HI>Camara</HI> are ancient coun|&s;ellors of Ca&s;tille; the&s;e &s;eldom obtain their places without having been pre&s;idents in &s;ome inferior tribunals. In the &s;ame manner from among the Advocates, Corregidors, or <HI>Alcaldes Mayores,</HI> the latter are cho&s;en. It may here not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome account of the different &s;pecies of <HI>Alcaldes,</HI> which are frequently confounded by foreigners; &s;o much &s;o, as if, in England, a &s;heriff's officer was to be taken for a ju&s;tice of the peace, or <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there are two cla&s;&s;es of &s;imple <HI>Alcaldes</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in the cities, boroughs, and villages. The <HI>Alcalde ordinario</HI> judges in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, when there is no Corregidor; but, in places where there is one, he has cognizance of civil cau&s;es in concurrence with him, whil&s;t the latter acts only in
<PB N="208" REF="211">
matters of police. The <HI>Alcalde pedanco,</HI> taken from the lower cla&s;s of people, has no other functions but tho&s;e of arre&s;ting delinquents, and executing the orders of the Corregidor, or <HI>Alcalde Mayor.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;imple <HI>Alcaldes</HI> are differently appointed, according to the places in which they re&s;ide. The <HI>Alcaldes Mayores,</HI> or <HI>Corregidors,</HI> which have both the &s;ame meaning, are all named by the King upon the pre&s;entation of the <HI>Camara.</HI> This inferior degree of magi&s;tracy was formerly under very im|proper regulations: the place of Corregidor being be&s;towed on per&s;ons of &s;mall fortune, who fre|quently expended their whole property in &s;oliciting the promotion. After having &s;ucceeded, they held their places three years, when their office expired, and they were again obliged to have recour&s;e to new &s;olicitations. How could it be expected that men, &s;carcely e&s;caped from want, and upon the brink of relap&s;ing into their former indigence, would not be tempted to in&s;ure to them&s;elves re|&s;ources at the expence of tho&s;e over whom they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tran&s;ient authority? It was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the &s;ubjects of the King from their rapa|city, and the magi&s;trates from temptation. Men virtuous, from an innate love of virtue, and who re&s;olve firmly not to commit evil, though they can perpetrate it to their advantage, and with impu|nity, are rare in every country; and the Corregidors
<PB N="209" REF="212">
but too frequently confirmed this melancholy truth. It was, therefore, determined that they &s;hould con|tinue in office &s;ix years in&s;tead of three, that there &s;hould be three cla&s;&s;es of them, and that they &s;hould pa&s;s from one cla&s;s to another, after having well di&s;charged the duties of their fir&s;t place; that their emoluments &s;hould be increa&s;ed at every re|moval; and that, having thus gone through the three cla&s;&s;es to the &s;atisfaction of his Maje&s;ty, they &s;hould have what is called in Spain the honours of <HI>Togado,</HI> that is, the title and prerogatives annexed to the place of coun&s;ellor of the &s;uperior tribunals, whether their acknowledged merit was rewarded by one of the&s;e places, or that they &s;till continued to occupy the po&s;t of Corregidor of the fir&s;t cla&s;s.</P>
<P>It now remains to &s;hew how ju&s;tice is admini|&s;tered in Madrid, as well as in the re&s;t of the king|dom. The Roman or civil law may be &s;aid, &s;trictly &s;peaking, to have here no force. This, by &s;ome old ordinances of the king's of Ca&s;tille, is even forbidden, under &s;evere penalties, to be &s;o much as quoted. The&s;e laws, however, which for &s;o long a time were the object of a blind admira|tion, and again&s;t which it is now become the cu&s;|tom to declaim with virulence, are frequently con|&s;ulted in practice. The Spaniards ob&s;erve a ju&s;t medium between the two extremes. They do not adopt the civil law implicitly, and look upon all
<PB N="210" REF="213">
its deci&s;ions as infallible; but their lawyers derive from it knowledge and authorities; being convinced that, in the mid&s;t of a number of laws contradictory to each other, many are to be found dictated by rea&s;on, and applicable to every legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>The only authentic laws, according to which ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered, are regi&s;tered in the Codes, publi&s;hed by the ancient kings; &s;uch as are the <HI>Ley de las &s;iete partidas,</HI> the <HI>Ordenamiento-Real,</HI> the <HI>Fuero-Juzgo,</HI> and <HI>Fuero-Real.</HI> The principal Code, that which is in con&s;tant u&s;e, is called <HI>Recopilacion.</HI> It is a collection of various and di&s;tinct edicts of the monarchs of Spain, from the earlie&s;t ages to the pre&s;ent reign. A new edition is given from time to time, in which all the laws, publi&s;hed &s;ince the la&s;t, are in&s;erted; for it is not till after they are thus regi&s;tered, that certain edicts acquire the force of law.</P>
<P>The canon law is the received code in Spain, in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. But it mu&s;t not be ima|gined that the court of Madrid pays implicit obe|dience to the orders of the holy &s;ee. There is no catholic kingdom in which more &s;ucce&s;sful efforts have been made to lighten this yoke.</P>
<P>There &s;till exi&s;ts in Spain, very great abu&s;e ari&s;|ing from religion, ill under&s;tood; this is the ex|treme
<PB N="211" REF="214">
riches of the monks and clergy. Next to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical principalities of Germany, the riche&s;t catholic prelacies are found in Spain. The archbi&s;hoprics of Toledo, Seville, St. Jago, Valen|cia, and Sarago&s;&s;a, have larger revenues than any in France. There are mona&s;teries, the property of which extends to the greate&s;t part of the di&s;trict in which they are &s;ituated, and the&s;e religious founda|tions, while they depopulate and impoveri&s;h the neighbouring country, increa&s;e poverty and idle|ne&s;s by indi&s;criminate charity.</P>
<P>The government, however, which becomes more and more enlightened, is endeavouring to le&s;&s;en the con&s;equence of the&s;e evils. In the fir&s;t place, the wi&s;e choice of prelates prevents in them that di&s;|play of offen&s;ive luxury, which, by irritating indi|gence, dimini&s;hes the re&s;pect due to religion. Their con&s;tant re&s;idence in their dioce&s;e, makes them expend their revenues in the country by which they are paid. All the prelates there employ a great part of their income in alms. When we come to treat of taxes, it will be &s;een that they pay con&s;iderable contributions.</P>
<P>In Spain there is but one religious in&s;titution, which philo&s;ophy mourns to &s;ee that nation &s;ub|jected to; it may be ea&s;ily perceived, that by this is meant the Holy Office, that tribunal to which

every odious epithet has been given, and which has &s;till, in Spain, two powerful &s;upporters, policy and religion.</P>
<P>Its defenders alledge, that the authority of the Sovereign find, in the Holy Office, a means of making it&s;elf re&s;pected, &s;ince, by chaining the con|&s;ciences of the &s;ubjects, it provides another &s;ecurity for their obedience. They a&s;&s;ert, that religion gains by it the pre&s;ervation of its unity and purity, and attribute to the inqui&s;ition the tranquillity which Spain has, in this re&s;pect, con&s;tantly enjoy|ed, whil&s;t the re&s;t of Europe has been a prey to all the bitterne&s;s of religious quarrels, and the turbu|lent zeal of innovators.</P>
<P>The antagoni&s;ts of the inqui&s;ition maintain, on the contrary, that it has fed &s;uper&s;tition and fanati|ci&s;m, and kept the mind in a &s;ervile &s;ubjection, fit only to repre&s;s tho&s;e vigorous efforts of genius by which great works of every kind are produced; that, while it contracts the heart by fear, it prevents the &s;weet effu&s;ions of confidence and friend&s;hip, de&s;troys the mo&s;t intimate connexions which con|&s;titute their charms, and, for two whole centuries, has condemned Spain to ignorance and barbari&s;m.</P>
<P>The&s;e are no doubt very &s;erious accu&s;ations. But an account of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this tribunal, will
<PB N="213" REF="216">
&s;hew how far they are well founded. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Holy Office was cotemporary with the religious wars, with all the outrages which fa|natici&s;m has produced in mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Chri&s;tendom. But, &s;ince that period, manners are happily become more civilized; and, if the primi|tive con&s;titution of the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition has not been changed, the rigours of it have at lea&s;t been &s;oftened, and are become le&s;s frequent. <HI>Auto de f&eacute;s</HI> are not the &s;ame pompous &s;olemnities as for|merly, when, by their apparatus, under pretence of honouring religion, they in&s;ulted humanity; when the whole nation ran to them as to a triumph; when the &s;overeign and all his court were pre&s;ent, believing they thus performed a mo&s;t meritorious act in the eyes of the Deity, and there enjoyed the torments of tho&s;e victims delivered up to the exe|cutioner, and the maledictions of the people.</P>
<P>The forms of the procedure excepted, the in|qui&s;ition may at pre&s;ent be e&s;teemed as a model of equity and mildne&s;s. It takes every po&s;&s;ible means of verifying the depo&s;itions it receives. Let it not be &s;aid, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> that the re&s;entment of a &s;ecret enemy is &s;ufficient to provoke its rigours. It condemns not upon the evidence of one accu&s;er, nor without di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the proofs of the accu&s;ations. Serious and repeated crimes are nece&s;&s;ary to incur its cen&s;ures; which, with a little circum&s;pection
<PB N="214" REF="217">
in words and conduct re&s;pecting religion, are ea&s;ily to be e&s;caped, and men may live as unmole&s;ted in Spain, as in any other country in Europe. The indi&s;creet zeal of &s;ome of the commi&s;&s;aries, indeed, di&s;turbs the quiet of the inhabitants in &s;ome cities, by entering their hou&s;es to confi&s;cate pictures too licentious, or books that are prohi|bited; but this zeal is repre&s;&s;ed either by the court or the Grand Inqui&s;itor, who in the pre&s;ent and late reign has always been a learned and prudent prelate.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, &s;ome French merchants at Cadiz, having received a con&s;ignment of leather from one of their manufactories, were much alarm|ed at &s;eeing the officers of the inqui&s;ition enter their hou&s;es. They de&s;ired to &s;ee the leather that was ju&s;t arrived, and having ob&s;erved that it bore the image of the <HI>Holy Virgin,</HI> which was the mark of the manufacture, exclaimed again&s;t the profanation. They remarked that the leather being intended to make &s;hoes, the image of the mother of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ran the hazard of being trodden under foot, and there|fore confi&s;cated it. The affair was referred to the &s;u|preme tribunal of Madrid. The merchants, much alarmed, had recour&s;e to the court, by the medium of their Amba&s;&s;ador. The con&s;equence of which was, that the officers of the inqui&s;ition were enjoined not to mole&s;t &s;trangers on &s;uch trifling pretences; and the
<PB N="215" REF="218">
merchants recovered their leather without further trouble.</P>
<P>On other occa&s;ions, &s;till more recent, the mi|ni&s;ter and the Grand Inqui&s;itor have protected the inhabitants again&s;t the cavils of the &s;ubalterns of the Holy Office. In a city of Andalu&s;ia they attempted to give di&s;turbance to a French hou&s;e, becau&s;e they were prote&s;tants; and, when it was ob&s;erved to them, that the Engli&s;h and other Northern nations were tolerated in Spain, though they were heretics, it was an&s;wered that the catholic religion was the only one e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. The cau&s;e, how|ever, of this per&s;ecuted hou&s;e was no &s;ooner brought before the court than it was gained.</P>
<P>In fine, tho' we &s;hould admit that bigotry is more prevalent in the capital than in the provinces, no great inconveniences can ari&s;e from it, becau&s;e the &s;entences of the provincial tribunals have no force until they have received the &s;anction of that of Ma|drid. Be&s;ides the court &s;crutinizes more &s;trictly than ever the proceedings of the inqui&s;ition, and certainly not with an intention of increa&s;ing its &s;everity.</P>
<P>The Holy Office, to this day, receives a certain tax from each ve&s;&s;el that arrives in any of the ports of Spain, in con&s;equence of the examination it is
<PB N="216" REF="219">
authorized to make, in order to &s;ee that the ve&s;&s;el contains nothing that may be offen&s;ive to religion. The &s;earch has been for a long time neglected, but the duty is &s;till paid.</P>
<P>Before we quit this &s;ubject we &s;hall take notice of another political body, which many &s;trangers confound with the inqui&s;ition, but which has no other relation with it than the common epithet.</P>
<P>This is the holy Thermandad, much &s;poken of in Spani&s;h novels; it is no more than a confrater|nity, in different parts of the kingdom of Ca&s;tille, to watch over the &s;afety of the country, by ap|prehending tho&s;e who di&s;turb the public peace. It is &s;ubordinate to the council of Ca&s;tille, who do not permit its Juri&s;diction to extend to cities.</P>
<P>Having now taking a general view of the con&s;ti|tution, government, and interior admini&s;tration of the Spani&s;h monarchy, both in civil and religious matters, we proceed to treat of its finances and population, or rather of the cau&s;es of its depo|pulation.</P>

<PB N="217" REF="220">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> On the Finances, Population, and General State of the Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P>THE finances of Spain may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es; and the&s;e compo&s;e mo&s;t of the revenues of the King: <HI>General rents</HI> and <HI>provincial rents.</HI></P>
<P>The general rents ari&s;e from duties paid at the frontiers upon merchandize entering or going out of the kingdom. This duty has been increa&s;ed by degrees, in many of the provinces, to 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon every article of importation or exportation. It varies however in different provinces, and in &s;ome is not more than four or five <HI>per cent. ad valo|rem.</HI> There are, be&s;ides, &s;everal articles, &s;uch as cocoa, chocolate, &s;ugar, and paper, which pay par|ticular duties.</P>
<P>The whole produce of the general rents when they were farmed, did not amount to more than about &pound;270,000. A few years after they, were put into commi&s;&s;ion they produced &pound;400,000, and in 1776, they produced &pound;580,000.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="221">There are &s;ome other duties which may be in|cluded in the general rents, although differently collected; and their produce does not enter the &s;ame che&s;t; &s;uch are the duties of the office of health, fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed at Cadiz, and &s;ince extended to the other &s;ea-ports in Spain.</P>
<P>Secondly, The duties of the <HI>Grand Admiral</HI> which were appropriated to the trea&s;ury by <HI>Ferdinand V.</HI> in 1748, and two other duties, one under the name of <HI>Lanzas,</HI> the other of <HI>medias annatas,</HI> or half the fir&s;t fruits. The fir&s;t is an annual contribution of nearly &pound;40, paid by all the grandees of Spain, and by every citizen honored with the title of Ca&s;tille. The half of the fir&s;t fruits is paid at each de&s;cent of the above titles, and amounts to about &pound;250. It is al&s;o levied upon all employments, to the amount of half the fir&s;t year's income, upon entering into office.</P>
<P>The produce from the &s;ale of &s;alt makes a &s;e|parate article in the finances of Spain. This is exclu&s;ively &s;old for the King's account, the &s;ame as in France, yet the revenue from &s;alt is not con|&s;iderable, and &s;carcely exceeds 4,000,000 livres, which is not the tenth part of what it produces in France, though the population of this latter country is not more than double that of Spain.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="222">There is &s;till a greater difference between the profits ari&s;ing to the&s;e two kingdoms from the &s;ale of tobacco, which is &s;old exclu&s;ively for the account of the Sovereign. In Spain, the produce of this article is calculated at 20,000,000 of livres, whereas in France, previous to the late revolution, it produced near &s;even times as much.</P>
<P>The prohibitory laws on this article in Spain are very &s;evere, and in certain ca&s;es makes the puni&s;h|ment of &s;elling it death. This, like all other laws which are too &s;evere, is &s;eldom enforced. Great quantities of tobacco are &s;muggled into Spain, and tho&s;e who vend it, at the exorbitant price of a guinea a pound, to gratify the inclinations which mankind always have for whatever is prohibited, are con&s;ider|able gainers by this illegal traffic.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o other articles &s;old exclu&s;ively for the King's account. The&s;e are brandy, lead, gunpowder, cards, Spani&s;h wax, and &s;tamped pa|per.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t reprehen&s;ible part of the Spani&s;h taxes, however, is the &s;econd cla&s;s; the provincial rents: a &s;pecies of impo&s;ts which, falling upon the nece&s;|&s;ary articles of life, is a burden to the people, and one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles to indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="223">The provincial rents are, fir&s;t, the produce of a duty upon wine, oil, meat, vinegar, candles, &amp;c. This was fir&s;t levied under <HI>Philip II.</HI> in 1590, who, being overwhelmed by the ruinous enterprizes to which his ambition had impelled him, propo&s;ed it to the Cortes, upon conditions, mo&s;t of which have been violated. This grant has been renewed every &s;ix years, and had different augmentations, called the &s;ervices of the <HI>Millones,</HI> becau&s;e it was for a certain number of millions of ducats that it was made.</P>
<P>Secondly, a duty of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> on every thing &s;old or bartered, whether u&s;ed in manufactures or hu&s;bandry, to be paid every time the property is transferred. This tax was fir&s;t granted by the Cor|tes in 1342. It was then but five <HI>per cent.</HI> In 1349, it received the increa&s;e of five <HI>per cent.</HI> more, and was made perpetual. In the 16th cen|tury it received four additions, each an hundredth part, whence it acquired the name of <HI>Cientos.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two duties united ought therefore to amount to 14 <HI>per cent.</HI> but they vary in different cities and provinces, according to particular privileges, grant|ed by the &s;overeign, which in &s;ome places have en|tirely &s;uper&s;eded them, and they are no where le|vied to their utmo&s;t extent; which, however, does
<PB N="221" REF="224">
not prevent their being very burthen&s;ome to indu&s;|try and commerce.</P>
<P>The <HI>tercias reales</HI> are another impo&s;t, collected with the provincial rents; the&s;e are two-ninths, which the Court of Rome, in 1274, permitted the kings of Spain to receive upon all the tenths of their kingdom. They are paid in kind from the produce of the earth, and afterwards &s;old for the king's account. This impo&s;t, with two or three others, collected under the &s;ame denomination, is not very productive; but would be &s;u&s;ceptible of con&s;iderable augmentation were government in col|lecting it, not to tru&s;t to the unfaithful &s;tatement of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices.</P>
<P>The duties of entry into Madrid al&s;o, form an|other &s;ource of revenue to the crown; the&s;e are at pre&s;ent farmed out to the community of <HI>Gremios,</HI> or five united companies of Madrid, at 7,000,0000 and a half of reals.</P>
<P>All the&s;e interior contributions, which relate only to the provinces of the crown of Ca&s;tille, produce about 1,400,000 pounds. The provinces of the crown of Arragon have another form of taxation, having no provincial rents, &s;uch as tho&s;e above|de&s;cribed. They pay one general contribution, which each city, borough, and community, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
<PB N="222" REF="225">
on its inhabitants. As &s;ome of the&s;e provinces were the la&s;t to hold out again&s;t <HI>Philip V.</HI> this form of taxation was intended as a puni&s;hment; but his intention has been defeated, as, in fact, they are better treated than the re&s;t of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Catalonia, which, more than any other province, excited the Monarch's indignation, was &s;ubjected to a regi&s;ter, in which all the lands were under|valued, and taxed at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> on their annual rents; but they &s;carce pay more than one <HI>per cent.</HI> To this regi&s;ter was added, a tax upon indu&s;try; but this, not being arbitrarily a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, is not bur|then&s;ome, and neither of them are prejudicial to agriculture or indu&s;try, in Catalonia.</P>
<P>The&s;e provinces are, however, &s;ubject to the tax called <HI>tercias real&egrave;s,</HI> and obliged to take at a fixed price the &s;alt, tobacco, lead, &amp;c. which are &s;old for the King's account. They are al&s;o equally &s;ubject to the bull of the cru&s;ade. The primitive object of this bull was to grant indulgences to tho&s;e Spaniards who &s;hould contribute to &s;upport the war again&s;t the infidels. Until the reign of <HI>Ferdi|nand VI.</HI> this grant of the court of Rome was to be renewed every five years, the inconvenience of which <HI>Philip V.</HI> was very &s;en&s;ible, on three dif|ferent occa&s;ions when his di&s;putes with the Holy See, prevented a renewal of the bull. It was not
<PB N="223" REF="226">
till 1753, that, by compact with the court of Rome, this bull was made perpetual, &s;ince which time it has been a con&s;tant &s;ource of revenue to the trea|&s;ury. The price of it is &s;even-pence or &s;even-pence-halfpenny. No catholic in Spain can di&s;pen&s;e with purcha&s;ing it, without having his orthodoxy &s;u&s;|pected. Provided with this bull, be&s;ides the other indulgences annexed to it, &s;uch as a remi&s;&s;ion from certain &s;ins, he has the liberty of eating meat, with the con&s;ent of his phy&s;ician and confe&s;&s;or; as al&s;o to eat eggs and milk on fa&s;t-days, and in Lent.</P>
<P>For this bull the nobles pay according to <HI>Town|&s;end,</HI> about &s;ix &s;hilling and four-pence: the com|mons about one third of that &s;um, in Arragon, but le&s;s in the provinces of Ca&s;tille. "No confe&s;&s;or (he adds) will grant ab&s;olution to any one who has not this bull." <HI>Town&s;end</HI> &s;ays, the produce of this tax is reckoned at above &pound;200,000 <HI>per annum,</HI> but <HI>Bourgoanne</HI> does not e&s;timate it at quite &s;o much.</P>
<P>The clergy are not exempt from this tax; nor is this the only one they pay. In the fir&s;t place they are in part &s;ubject to that of <HI>millones;</HI> but to this it is nece&s;&s;ary the Pope &s;hould con&s;ent, every &s;ix years, by a brief. Be&s;ides, as in mo&s;t ca&s;es, fact differs from right, the clergy pay next to nothing of the
<PB N="224" REF="227">
<HI>millones,</HI> which tax falls upon the body of the people.</P>
<P>There is another impo&s;t, called <HI>&s;ub&s;idio,</HI> to which the clergy are liable. This is one <HI>per cent.</HI> granted by the Pope to the King's of Spain, upon all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical lands, for the wars again&s;t the infidels.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t contribution levied upon them, is the <HI>e&s;cu&s;ado,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in the right, granted by the Holy See to the kings of Spain, to appro+priate to them&s;elves the mo&s;t advantageous tenth of each pari&s;h throughout the whole kingdom. In every pari&s;h the King choo&s;es the be&s;t farm, whether for olives, corn, or wine, of which he takes the tythes both in Ca&s;tille and Arragon. The clergy formerly agreed with him for this. Afterwards it was farmed by the <HI>gremios,</HI> or five united companies of merchants at Madrid, for 12,000,000 of reals; but in the year 1778, the clergy had the grant for one third le&s;s. Mo&s;t of them accepted the offer, but they who thought them&s;elves too poor to ven|ture, refu&s;ed, and the&s;e farms are let to the <HI>gremios,</HI> at 4,000,000. The <HI>gremios</HI> have been accu&s;ed of this bargain, to purcha&s;e corn in all the country villages, when it is cheap, to lodge it in their gra|naries, and then &s;elling it out at a high price, to &s;tarve the people, and enrich them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="228">It may be imagined that Spani&s;h America is one great &s;ource of revenue to the royal trea&s;ury; but hitherto its produce has been but trifling. For a long time the expences of the admini&s;tration of the&s;e immen&s;e colonies, were not defrayed by the revenues they produced: and it is only &s;ince the admini&s;tration of M. de Galvez that Mexico has yielded a &s;urplus, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the farm of tobacco. The Indian revenue in America is &s;aid to amount to near 4,000,000 and an half &s;ter|ling.</P>
<P>"All the&s;e duties and contributions (&s;ays <HI>Bour|goanne</HI>) of which we have given a &s;ummary ac|account, amounted in 1776, to no more than 110,000,000 of livres, or about 4,000,000 and an half &s;terling, and the expenditure was then exceed|ed by the receipts." This, according to <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> appears to have been the ca&s;e ten years after; for in the year 1786, the Mini&s;ter of the Finance, in his circular letter, &s;ent through all the provinces, urged the collectors to double diligence in collecting the taxes, becau&s;e the expences of government were 40,000,000 of reals more than the revenue. Since that &s;hort period the revenue is increa&s;ed, and the la&s;t &s;tatement of Mr. <HI>Eden,</HI> our Amba&s;&s;ador, is 500,000,000 of reals, or 5,000,000 Briti&s;h, and that now they have a &s;urplus of revenue to di&s;charge former debts.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="229">Though the debts of this kingdom are not &s;o great as tho&s;e of France or England, yet they amount to a very con&s;iderable &s;um, and are of va|rious kinds; &s;ome ancient, and &s;ome more recent. The former date their origin from the revolt of the Belgic provinces, in 1566, and a conflict of more than 43 years, during which, contracting a debt of 200,000,000 of dollars, Spain brought on &s;uch a derangement in her finances, that &s;he has ever &s;ince been in a crippled &s;tate, when &s;he has found her&s;elf engaged in a war. The country, exhau&s;ted by this long conte&s;t, cried univer&s;ally for peace, and <HI>Philip III.</HI> in 1609, although he would not ac|knowledge the &s;overeignty of the new republic, con&s;ented to a truce; but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, having other views, provoked ho&s;tilities, carried on a very ex|pen&s;ive war, and, before he con&s;ented to the peace of Mun&s;ter, and to the independency of the United Provinces, in 1646, di&s;covered that he had doubled the debt; which, therefore, amounted to about 60,000,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>The principal creditors, the Genoe&s;e, and other foreign merchants; to whom, as &s;ecurity for pay|ment of the principal, with intere&s;t, government a&s;&s;igned certain portions of the revenue, denominated <HI>Juros;</HI> becau&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed, like other property, ei|ther by de&s;cent or transfer.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="230">The&s;e Genoe&s;e, and other foreign merchants, being, after the expul&s;ion of the Jews, the chief farmers of the revenue, were accu&s;ed of innume|rable frauds again&s;t the public; and this, both with the connivance and participation of the clerks and comptrollers of the trea&s;ury. When their evil practices were brought to light, they &s;old their <HI>juros</HI> to the natives; yet frauds continued, and thus admini&s;tered, the intere&s;t of the debt &s;wallowed up the whole of the revenue.</P>
<P>In order therefore to redeem the&s;e <HI>juros,</HI> the tax called <HI>millones,</HI> already &s;poken of, was granted by the Cortes; yet the deficit continued: In con&s;e|quence of this, many who&s;e ance&s;tors had purcha&s;ed <HI>juros</HI> were happy to &s;ell them at a lo&s;s of 90 <HI>per cent.</HI> whil&s;t the Genoe&s;e and &s;trangers, &s;till farmers of the revenue, being purcha&s;ers, paid them back for rent, to government, at par.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s of public debts are tho&s;e con|tracted by the Emperor <HI>Charles V.</HI> in his ra&s;h war. The&s;e amounted, according to the Abb&eacute; <HI>Raynal,</HI> to near 42,000,000 &s;terling. But the intere&s;t of this being then more than the whole revenue, the &s;tate, in the year 1688, became bankrupt.</P>
<P>At the death of <HI>Charles II.</HI> and the acce&s;&s;ion of a new family, public credit was re&s;tored; and, in le&s;s
<PB N="228" REF="231">
than half a century, <HI>Philip V.</HI> availing him&s;elf of this reviving confidence, contracted fre&s;h engage|ments, to the amount of near 7,000,000 &s;ter|ling. At his death, <HI>Ferdinand VI.</HI> his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, an equitable and pious prince, terrified at &s;o enormous a burden, and he&s;itating between the fear of making the &s;tate &s;upport it, and the &s;cruple of depriving the creditors of their right, a&s;&s;embled a junto, compo&s;ed of mini&s;ters, bi&s;hops, and lawyers, and propo&s;ed to them the following que&s;tion; <HI>Is a king obliged to pay the debts of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors?</HI> Will it be believed that it was decided in the negative, under pretence that the &s;tate was a patrimony, of which the &s;overeign had but the temporary u&s;e, and that he was an&s;werable for no engagements but his own? This deci&s;ion, equally contrary to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and policy, quieted the con&s;cience of the monarch, and legalized in his eyes that which was a real bankruptcy. The payment of the debts of Spain was entirely &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P><HI>Ferdinand VI.</HI> carried his incon&s;iderate economy &s;till further; wholly employed in making &s;avings, he &s;uffered every branch of admini&s;tration to lan|gui&s;h; the army, fortre&s;&s;es, and colonies were neglected. When <HI>Charles III.</HI> a&s;cended the throne, in 1759, he found in the royal coffers upwards of 165,000,000 of livres. The new &s;overeign, more delicate in his &s;cruples than his predece&s;&s;or, thought
<PB N="229" REF="232">
it incumbent on him to repair the fatal omi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ferdinand VI.</HI> In 1761, he paid &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> of the capital due from <HI>Philip V.</HI> but, beginning with his own &s;ubjects, he put off foreigners until all the Spani&s;h debts &s;hould be di&s;charged. This was act|ing towards his &s;ubjects as a good father might to|wards his children, but it was perhaps de&s;troying all the &s;ources of future foreign credit. In modern times, when war co&s;ts more money than men, when great enterprizes require frequently prodigious &s;ums, what &s;tate can &s;upply its own wants? Spain continued for five years to pay &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> in dimi|nution of her capital debt. In 1767 the dividend was reduced to four <HI>per cent.</HI> and in 1769 the expences of the &s;tate were &s;o increa&s;ed as to nece&s;&s;i|tate a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of further dividends; an interrup|tion which gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the credit of government. They are &s;till received in payment of fir&s;t-fruits, but, except in this, and one or two other ca&s;es, the claims of <HI>Philip V.</HI> are almo&s;t of no value; they bear no intere&s;t, and the entire liquidi|tion of them, if ever it &s;hould take place, can on|ly be con&s;idered as very di&s;tant.</P>
<P>It is not but the Spani&s;h government perceives the inconvenience of depriving the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e claims of their rights. But the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate have not hitherto permitted it to adopt proper mea&s;ures. In 1783 government endeavoured
<PB N="230" REF="233">
with this view, to open a loan of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">80,000,000 of reals. One of the conditions of the loan was, that the claims upon <HI>Philip V.</HI> &s;hould be received, to the amount of a third of the &s;ub&s;cription. This, how|ever, did not rai&s;e the value of the claims &s;o much as was expected; the credit of &s;tates re&s;embles the human body, an in&s;tant may de&s;troy either, but much time is required to give them &s;trength and maturity. The loan, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be of|fered upon advantageous terms, tempted but few per&s;ons to &s;ub&s;cribe. Foreigners, who would have been glad to have made advantage of their claims, were deterred by the con&s;ideration that they mu&s;t ri&s;k a capital double the &s;um they wi&s;hed to recover. The loan, in fact, recalled to their minds the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h nation is in general &s;u&s;picious, and does not re&s;emble tho&s;e which the &s;pirit of &s;tock-jobbing keeps in continual fermentation. Far from being tempted by foreign &s;peculations, for the &s;ake of greater gain, it confines its confidence to the company of merchants at Madrid, known by the name of <HI>Gremios,</HI> of which we have already had oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak. The trea&s;ure of the <HI>Gremios</HI> is a kind of public bank, in which individuals may place their money at the moderate intere&s;t of two and a half and three <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="234">The foundation of this confidence ari&s;es from the &s;upport given by government to the <HI>Gremios,</HI> and from the regularity ob&s;erved by this &s;ociety in paying the intere&s;t of the capital in their hands. The government, which has frequently had recour&s;e to them in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, has long con&s;idered this bank as the chief pillar of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Admini&s;tration has however lately perceived that it could do without them. During the late war in America, Spain being obliged to i&s;&s;ue paper cur|rency, at different periods, to the amount of be|tween four and five millions &s;terling, notwith&s;tand|ing the high intere&s;t it bore, and its being deemed lawful payment in all money tran&s;actions, the&s;e bills were for a long time received with repugnance; and the paper money i&s;&s;ued by government was de|preciated 24 <HI>per cent.</HI> when <HI>M. Cabarrus,</HI> by the in&s;titution of a national bank, called the bank of <HI>S. Charles,</HI> re&s;tored the public credit, and &s;aved the country.</P>
<P>This bank is too &s;ingular in its hi&s;tory to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. The principal object pro|po&s;ed was to e&s;tabli&s;h a capital, which &s;hould di&s;|count, at four <HI>per cent. per annum,</HI> all bills drawn upon Madrid. This re&s;ource was moderate, Ma|drid not being properly a commercial city. It was further held out, that the profits of the <HI>realgiro,</HI> a
<PB N="232" REF="235">
particular &s;pecies of bank, from which the court takes the money it has occa&s;ion to &s;end abroad for the payment of amba&s;&s;adors, envoys, con&s;uls, &amp;c. or for other purpo&s;es, &s;hould be given to the na|tional bank. This likewi&s;e was but a weak re|&s;ource; the <HI>realgiro</HI> not paying more than two or three millions of livres annually.</P>
<P>But the chief &s;ource of profit which <HI>M. Cabarrus</HI> propo&s;ed to open to the national bank, was the victualling and furni&s;hing of the army and na|vy: for this they were to be allowed ten <HI>per cent.</HI> commi&s;&s;ion for their trouble, be&s;ides four <HI>per cent. per annum,</HI> on all the money they &s;hould advance. Be&s;ides this, they were to have the exclu&s;ive privilege of exporting &s;pecie, collecting from the merchant four <HI>per cent.</HI> and three for the u&s;e of the bank. No entail was to be valid again&s;t the de|mands of the bank. Such were the advantages held forth to &s;ub&s;cribers.</P>
<P>Its fir&s;t in&s;titution was to con&s;i&s;t of 150,000 &s;hares, at 2000 reals each, con&s;tituting a capital of 3,000,000 &s;terling, with liberty to add, annually, 3000 &s;hares, for 30 years, in order that there might not be one citizen of the Spani&s;h empire excluded from this be|neficial enterprize.</P>
<P>To create a confidence in the public, the directors
<PB N="233" REF="236">
were not to enter into any &s;peculation, except where the King &s;hould give them a commi&s;&s;ion for foreign and di&s;tant commerce, or to favour the agriculture and manufactures of the kingdom; and to remove all occa&s;ions of jealou&s;y, they were to have no mo|nopoly; they were to receive at <HI>par,</HI> and there|by to procure a circulation for the government paper.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had property to purcha&s;e &s;hares were not excluded from the profits which the&s;e &s;hares might produce, and, according to the pro&s;pectus, they &s;eemed to be very promi&s;ing. Be&s;ides the idle money to which an advantageous opening was to be given, it was hoped that great part of that in the hands of the <HI>Gremios,</HI> which was at &s;uch a very low intere&s;t, would be removed from their coffers to tho&s;e of the national bank. The &s;urplus of the grants from cities and communities was al&s;o reck|oned upon. The&s;e, were in the admini&s;tration of the council of Ca&s;tille, whence the national bank was to take them, and make &s;uch u&s;e of them as &s;hould be mo&s;t advantageous to the per&s;ons con|cerned. In Spain there are magazines of grain in mo&s;t of the cities, boroughs, and villages, and of the&s;e there are upwards of 5000. Their &s;urplus is converted into money. This al&s;o was an u&s;ele&s;s capital, which the bank might employ. Hence it appears that great advantages were promi&s;ed to every
<PB N="234" REF="237">
cla&s;s of citizens. It is not therefore a&s;toni&s;hing that the mini&s;ter adopted the project.</P>
<P>This bank met with rough u&s;age in its begin|ning, but the indefatigable application of its pro|jector, &s;upported by the good &s;en&s;e of Count <HI>Flo|rida Blanca,</HI> overcame all difficulties, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it on a firm foundation. The fir&s;t year the bank divided nine and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> and the &s;econd year a &s;imilar dividend was made, be&s;ides an in|ve&s;tment of 21,000,000 of reals, amounting to nearly as much more, in the New Philippine Com|pany.</P>
<P>In May, 1785, the bank made a propo&s;al, the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of which will furni&s;h a new employment to its funds. This was to undertake the completion of the canal which begins at the foot of the moun|tains of Guadarama, and terminates at the Guadal|quavir, after cro&s;&s;ing the centre of Spain. It has offered to &s;uperintend the work, receiving ten <HI>per cent.</HI> commi&s;&s;ion, and four <HI>per cent. per annum,</HI> for all the money they &s;hould expend. This propo&s;al has been accepted by government, which will fur|ni&s;h the bank with another means of augmenting its profits, and rendering it&s;elf advantageous to Spain, without endangering the funds.</P>
<P>"The placing money in this bank, (&s;ays <HI>Bour|goanne</HI>)
<PB N="235" REF="238">
I deem, with impartial judges, &s;afe and advantageous. Not that the great dividends with which it hath began are always to be expected. The exportation of pia&s;tres will not in future be &s;o beneficial as it was immediately after the peace; but &s;o long as the bank pre&s;erves that exclu&s;ive pri|vilege, and government &s;hall confide to it the vic|tualling, and other &s;upplies for the army and navy, the principal &s;ource of its profits, the &s;ub&s;cribers may reckon upon an intere&s;t, of from five to &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>It may here be proper to &s;peak of the quantity of money circulating in Spain, the amount of which is very difficult to come at, as great part of that &s;truck in the Indies pa&s;&s;es clande&s;tinely into Eu|rope. It is, therefore, only from loo&s;e calculation, and the opinions of &s;ome well-informed merchants, &s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne,</HI> that I have e&s;timated it at 80,000,000 of double pia&s;tres, or about 16,500,000 &s;terling. It will, perhaps, be thought extraordi|nary, that Spain, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the gold and &s;ilver mines in the world, and annually coining 30,000,000 of pia&s;tres, &s;hould be reduced to &s;o moderate a &s;um of circulating money, e&s;pecially when it is recollected, that in the reign of <HI>Charles V.</HI> it contained almo&s;t all the gold and &s;ilver in Eu|rope; and, what is &s;till more valuable, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the productions of its &s;oil and indu&s;try, the
<PB N="236" REF="239">
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without the aid of any other nation.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a century has this kingdom fallen from &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;plendour. To what is this &s;o rapid and total a revolution to be attributed? To the abundance of the precious metals, which have increa&s;ed the price of manufactures, and the wages of workmen; to the great depopulation, occa&s;ioned by the numerous emigrations to America; the great de&s;truction of men in the long wars, at a di&s;tance from the frontiers; and the expul&s;ion of the Moors and the Jews. It may al&s;o be more particularly attributed to the ruinous wars, undertaken by <HI>Philip II.</HI> again&s;t the Low Countries; and which, from the year 1567 to the truce in 1612, co&s;t up|wards of 200,000,000 of pia&s;tres. But every thing announces, that Spain is ri&s;ing from her own a&s;hes, and will &s;oon be indu&s;triou&s;ly employed in culti|vating her &s;oil, and animating her manufactures. Weary of pur&s;uing a pa&s;&s;ive commerce, &s;he will &s;oon cea&s;e to le&s;&s;en her current coin, by paying foreign indu&s;try, and &s;ending every year the greate&s;t part of her money into foreign countries, for fo|reign produces.</P>
<P>The population of Spain, in 1787, appears to have been 10,268,150 &s;ouls. Such are the la&s;t re|turns to government. In the year 1770, the po|pulation,
<PB N="237" REF="240">
by the &s;ame authority, was &s;tated to be 9,307,803. From thence it would &s;eem that, in 17 years, the population had increa&s;ed nearly 1,000,000 of inhabitants. In like manner, the number of &s;ouls in 1723, were 7,625,000, from whence it might be inferred, &s;ince that period &s;he had advanced in population more than 2,500,000. But, according to <HI>U&s;tariz,</HI> the returns to Govern|ment are not always ju&s;t; and the people, to le&s;&s;en their contributions of men and money, conceal their numbers, and make fal&s;e returns. This, however, is no conclu&s;ive argument again&s;t the increa&s;ed population of Spain. For it is rea&s;onable to infer, that the people have concealed their num|bers, in the &s;ame proportion, in each of the returns.</P>
<P>Now, if from the number above &s;tated as the population of 1787, we deduct 358,264, the&s;e being out of the penin&s;ula, and inhabiting either the i&s;lands or the coa&s;ts of Africa, we &s;hall have for the remainder 9,909,886; and, if we allow the area of Spain to be 148,448 &s;quare miles, we &s;hall find 67 per&s;ons nearly to a &s;quare mile. This, if compared with Ru&s;&s;ia, is re&s;pectable; if with France, below mediocrity. In the former, they reckon five to a &s;quare mile; in the latter, 157. England comes in between France and Spain; but Spain, if properly cultivated, and well-governed,
<PB N="238" REF="241">
might be the fir&s;t in Europe; not excepting Hol|land, which to its wi&s;e and equitable laws, is in|debted for a population amounting to 272 on a &s;quare mile. <HI>Bernardo Ward,</HI> who was in the em|ployment of the Spani&s;h government, admits that 18,000 &s;quare leagues, of the riche&s;t land, are left uncultivated, and that 2,000,000 of the people are unemployed.</P>
<P>All are agreed, that Spain in more di&s;tant periods was much better peopled than at pre&s;ent. It may be u&s;eful, therefore, to trace the circum&s;tances which have contributed to depre&s;s this once-power|ful nation, and de&s;olate, at lea&s;t, comparatively, one of the riche&s;t countries in Europe.</P>
<P>In the year 1347, the plague broke out with more than common violence, at Almeria, and for three years ravaged Spain to &s;uch an extent, that many cities were left almo&s;t without inhabitants; and, through the whole penin&s;ula, it reduced the population to one-third of what it was previous to that event. Sub&s;equent to this cruel misfortune, Spain has been repeatedly laid wa&s;te by pe&s;tilential fevers, introduced from Africa, or dating their origin from &s;ome preceding famine. In 1649, more than 200,000 peri&s;hed in the &s;outhern pro|vinces. Such a va&s;t extent of territory as this pe|nin&s;ula contains, having no communication either
<PB N="239" REF="242">
by roads or canals, divided formerly into a multi|tude of independent kingdoms, and, at a &s;ub&s;e|quent period, into provinces, each exacting heavy duties on the introduction of grain into them, mu&s;t often have felt di&s;tre&s;s for want of bread. In fact, one province has been reduced to the extremity of famine, whil&s;t others have been ruined by abun|dance. In 1642, wheat &s;old in Seville as high as 15 &s;hillings and three-pence the bu&s;hel, and the year following &s;o low as 16 pence. It was not till the year 1752, that corn was permitted to pa&s;s from one province to another. The con&s;equence of famine, as is well known, is pe&s;tilence. The ordinary diet of the pea&s;ants predi&s;po&s;es them to receive infection, and the practice of the phy|&s;icians in pre&s;cribing vene&s;ection indi&s;criminately to all their patients, does but increa&s;e the ma|lady.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances concurring, few countries have &s;u&s;tained &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, by epidemic di&s;ea&s;es and pe&s;tilential fevers.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of depopulation is, that for more than &s;even centuries, from the year 714 to 1492, Spain was harra&s;&s;ed by ince&s;&s;ant &s;truggles, and the heart of that divided country, contending for dominion. The&s;e &s;truggles did not cea&s;e till the marriage of <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> united the crown of Arragon and
<PB N="240" REF="243">
Ca&s;tille, and the conque&s;t of Granada put a period to the empire of the Moors.</P>
<P>In 1493, <HI>Columbus</HI> opened a new channel for Spa|ni&s;h ambition, and gave beginning to endle&s;s emi|grations, by the di&s;covery of America. Previous to this period the nobility re&s;ided mo&s;tly on their e&s;tates, and, when not engaged in war, gave them|&s;elves up to the arrangement of their dome&s;tic con|cerns. Without accumulating trea&s;ures, many were able to conduct 5 or 6000 &s;oldiers into the field; but when they had &s;een the gold and &s;ilver of Peru and Mexico, they became re&s;tle&s;s and im|patient to obtain employment in tho&s;e countries, and neglected the flower, yet more certain means of obtaining wealth, by the improvement of their lands. The people likewi&s;e emigrated in &s;uch numbers to America, that the maritime provinces &s;uffered very e&s;&s;entially by their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Emigrations, if regular, and in due proportion, do not weaken the parent &s;tate, but when &s;ud|den, and carried beyond certain bounds, tend to impoveri&s;h and depopulate a country. The former may be ob&s;erved in the Highlands of Scot|land, in Switzerland, and many parts of Germany: the latter was vi&s;ible on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of Ame|rica, and has ever &s;ince been &s;everely felt.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="244">From the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Charles I.</HI> of Spain, but the <HI>Vth</HI> of Germany, in 1506, Spain was engaged in war, with &s;hort intervals, for two centuries more, there|by, exhau&s;ting the trea&s;ures of America, and wa&s;t|ing the blood of its mo&s;t adventurous &s;ubjects in Italy, Germany, Flanders, Portugal, and France, only to gratify the ambition of its &s;overeigns, and extend the bounds of their unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>The immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Charles,</HI> having Spain, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Milan, Franche Compt&eacute;, and 17 provinces in the Low Countries, be&s;ides Portugal, and boundle&s;s territories in North and South America; &s;uch an immen&s;e and di&s;|per&s;ed empire, weak in proportion to its extent, perpetually con&s;umed both men and money, without the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;olidly uniting &s;uch di&s;tant and di&s;|cordant provinces, under one command.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e, however, u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned for the depopulation of Spain, as if it were the only one, is the expul&s;ion of the Moors. To this may be added the previous expul&s;ion of the Jews, to the number of 800,000, who were bani&s;hed by <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> in gratitude to Heaven for the conque&s;t of Granada.</P>
<P>Con&s;equent to the expul&s;ion of the Moors, their depredations along the whole extent of the coa&s;t
<PB N="142" REF="245">
wa&s;hed by the waters of the Mediterranean, render|ed the mo&s;t fertile parts of Spain un&s;afe, and the produce precarious. For the la&s;t century the num|ber of Spani&s;h captives at Algiers has u&s;ually been about 30,000, and their ran&s;om, reckoned one with another, &pound;150 at which it has been e&s;timat|ed, amounts to 4,000,000 and an half &s;terling. With &s;uch premiums for the ran&s;om of their cap|tives, the&s;e pirates found ample &s;upplies for the equipment of their gallies.</P>
<P>No country ever invented a more ruinous &s;y&s;tem of finance, or one le&s;s friendly to manufactures and commerce. The tax of 14 <HI>per cent.</HI> on all com|modities, both on the raw materials, and on the &s;ame when manufactured, as often as the property changes hands, rated, not according to the prime co&s;t, but the &s;elling price, is almo&s;t &s;ufficient of it|&s;elf, to occa&s;ion a general &s;tagnation. This effect is vi&s;ible in Ca&s;tille, whil&s;t in Catalonia, and in the province of Arragon, where <HI>Philip V.</HI> exchanged this oppre&s;&s;ive tax for <HI>the equivalent,</HI> indu&s;try pre|vails and manufactures flouri&s;h. The <HI>millones</HI> like|wi&s;e being a tax on provi&s;ions, tends to enhance the price of labour, and thereby indirectly forms an ob|&s;tacle to foreign commerce.</P>
<P>Convents al&s;o are by no means favourable to po|pulation. The&s;e in Spain are 8932; containing
<PB N="243" REF="246">
near 100,000 monks and nuns; but the per&s;ons bound to celibacy by vows are little &s;hort of 200,000. The univer&s;ity of Toledo, in a memorial delivered to <HI>Philip III.</HI> in the beginning of the 17th century, complains, that not one tenth of the u&s;ual marriages took place; and particularly &s;tates, that, whil&s;t commerce flouri&s;hed, it had been u&s;ually &s;aid, he who has a trade has the be&s;t benefice; but that now all parents, dreading the poverty and wretched|ne&s;s attached to trade, were inclined to breed up their children nuns, monks, and pari&s;h prie&s;ts, or expo&s;ed them to peri&s;h in their infancy. Some of the be&s;t Spani&s;h writers on political economy, (&s;ays <HI>Count Campomanes,</HI> in his <HI>Education Populaire</HI>) have declared again&s;t multiplying convents; and the cortes, with the con&s;ent of <HI>Philip IV.</HI> determined, in the la&s;t century, that no more &s;hould be built; but as general opinion is more powerful than law, this re&s;olution of the cortes was never carried into effect.</P>
<P>"Numerous fe&s;tivals (remarks the above writer) contribute to depopulate a country. <HI>Benedict XIV.</HI> le&s;&s;ened the number in his temporal e&s;tates, and recommended a &s;imilar reduction to his clergy. In con&s;equence of this they have now only 93 gene|ral fe&s;tivals, not including the &s;pecial fe&s;tivals of each pari&s;h, and of the religious hou&s;es, which in every city &s;well the number of unproductive
<PB N="244" REF="247">
days. If to the&s;e are added, the bull-fea&s;ts, and the Mondays, claimed by all cla&s;&s;es of working-people for their diver&s;ion, the number of days in which work is done will be reduced very con&s;ider|ably; be&s;ides this, a fre&s;h reduction mu&s;t be made from their time, becau&s;e the working hours are &s;el|dom more than &s;ix.</P>
<P>Prevalence of pa&s;ture al&s;o tends to depopulate a country. The &s;ame quantity of land, which in wild pa&s;ture would require the labour of one family, when tilled, gives employment to 20 or even twice that number. In Spain, ever &s;ince the year 1350, when the plague carried off two-thirds of the inha|bitants, the laws of the <HI>Me&s;ta</HI> have &s;et the plough|man and the &s;hepherd at variance, and prevented each from deriving the lea&s;t advantage from the other, &s;o that 5,000,000 &s;heep, under the &s;anction of a peculiar code, not only fail to enrich the lands on which they feed, but effectually prevent its cul|tivation. Independent of the <HI>Merino</HI> flock, many of the great landlords have &s;uffered villages to go to ruin, and let their e&s;tates to graziers.</P>
<P>The want of yeomenry and &s;ub&s;tantial tenants is another ob&s;tacle to population. The di&s;tracted and divided &s;tate of the country, during the domi|nion of the Moors, made it nece&s;&s;ary for the pea|&s;ants to &s;eek refuge in the cities, or a&s;&s;ociate in
<PB N="245" REF="248">
villages for their mutual defence. For this rea&s;on, independent farms, detached and di&s;tant from a town, are &s;eldom or ever &s;een in the &s;outhern pro|vinces of Spain. In the year 1347, when the plague had &s;pread de&s;olation through the country, many towns and villages were &s;uffered to go to ruin and decay. To this event has been attributed the exten&s;ive territories of innumerable towns, many of which are from ten to 15 miles diameter, and therefore too far di&s;tant from the habitation of the farmer to admit of cultivation. Adjoining to the village may be ob&s;erved vines, olives, figs, and grain. All beyond is de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Previous to the recovery of the &s;outhern domi|nion from the Moors, many of the nobility could bring into the field 5 or 6000 va&s;&s;als. But then, as mo&s;t of the&s;e were little le&s;s than independent &s;overeigns, the prince was obliged to court and al|lure them to his &s;tandard, by the hope of making conque&s;ts for them&s;elves. Hence they acquired towns, cities, and villages, with exten&s;ive di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>In &s;ucceeding periods, the great nobility, taking advantage of the minority of the &s;overeign, extort|ed con&s;iderable grants from the king's deme&s;ne, in addition to tho&s;e they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, all which they tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. By intermarriages, many of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have been united; three
<PB N="246" REF="249">
great lords, the <HI>Dukes of O&s;una, Alba,</HI> and <HI>Medina-Coeli,</HI> cover almo&s;t the whole province of Andalu&s;ia; and the la&s;t of the&s;e claims, by inheritance, the greate&s;t part of Catalonia.</P>
<P>Such va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, pa&s;&s;ing by entail, are not friendly to population, more e&s;pecially as the pro|prietor never re&s;ides upon his e&s;tates, and, being frequently in embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, is little able to make improvements for his heirs.</P>
<P>The national prejudice again&s;t the &s;ettlement of &s;trangers in Spain may likewi&s;e be added among the de&s;olating cau&s;es. In 1622 &s;trangers were al|lowed to be naturalized, and either to take farms or practi&s;e their mechanic arts, provided they did not &s;ettle within 20 leagues of the coa&s;t. In 1772, this privilege was extended to merchants, who were permitted to &s;ettle in any of the ports. For want of intercour&s;e with other nations, all the arts, &s;ci|ences and manufactures, appear to be at lea&s;t a century behind the re&s;t of Europe. In the year 1655, an author of high reputation, in his di&s;cour&s;e on the population of Spain, a&s;&s;erted, that 120,000 &s;trangers &s;pread them&s;elves over the country, and by their indu&s;try carried out of the kingdom, an|nually, near 1,000,000 &s;terling. He therefore re|commends alms to be given to &s;trangers, but not employment, and relates the hi&s;tory of a Spani&s;h
<PB N="247" REF="250">
farrier, as an example to be followed. This man went to Paris, to work at his trade, but, being threatened with death, if he attempted to exerci&s;e his art in that metropolis, he retired to Bour|deaux, hoping there to find a more ho&s;pitable re|ception; but in that place they cut off one of his arms, that he might no longer work, and rob the French farrier of his bread.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution too is a powerful cau&s;e of depopula|tion. It were endle&s;s to enumerate the advantages a community derives from toleration. As without an e&s;tabli&s;hed religion the poor would be neglected, and in danger of lo&s;ing all knowledge of the Deity; &s;o without a toleration, according to <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> there could be no competition, and therefore little &s;cope for emulation, without which, zeal, he &s;ays, would langui&s;h, and morals decay.</P>
<P>The gold and &s;ilver of America, &s;ay the Spa|ni&s;h writers of eminence, in&s;tead of animating the country, and promoting indu&s;try, have had an op|po&s;ite effect, and produced in the end, weakne&s;s, poverty, and depopulation. The wealth ari&s;ing from indu&s;try, re&s;embles the copious, yet tranquil &s;tream, which, pa&s;&s;ing &s;ilently along, enriches the whole extent of country through which it flows; but the trea&s;ures of the new world, like a &s;welling torrent, were &s;een, were heard, were felt, and
<PB N="248" REF="251">
were admired; yet their fir&s;t operation was de&s;o|lating and laying wa&s;te the &s;pot on which they fell. The price of labour, provi&s;ions, and manufactures, bore proportion to the quantity of circulating ca&s;h. The con&s;equence of which was, that all the manu|factures went to ruin and decay; every thing was imported from abroad, and, till the pre&s;ent century, Spain purcha&s;ed all her men of war, with ma&s;ts and cordage from Holland, rigging from France, ammu|nition from England, and even her gallies from the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P>Among other cau&s;es of depopulation, <HI>Count Cam|pomanes</HI> reckons, likewi&s;e, corporations. In Spain the&s;e are injurious to a degree &s;carce to be con|ceived. In all the trading companies, or <HI>Gremios,</HI> religious fraternities are formed, who make laws, &s;it in judgment on offenders, and in many ca&s;es claim exemption from the common tribunals of the country.</P>
<P>The&s;e corporations, which are e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities, bani&s;h by their oppre&s;&s;ive laws, all the me|chanic arts from towns and villages. In the cities they limit the numbers in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and go &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ign the di&s;tance between &s;hop and &s;hop, under pretence that two &s;hops vend|ing the &s;ame commodity, mu&s;t not be &s;o near as to
<PB N="249" REF="252">
interfere with each other: in other cities they a&s;|&s;emble all the mechanics of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion in one &s;treet, particularly &s;ilver&s;miths, the pretext for which then is, that the magi&s;trate may more ea&s;ily in&s;pect their work, and &s;ee that the various articles in which they traffic are of a proper &s;tandard.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es the various <HI>Gremios</HI> bear hard up|on each other. The carpenter mu&s;t not employ his indu&s;try on any other wood but deal, nor mu&s;t he invade the province of the turner. The turner mu&s;t work only in wood, and not pre&s;ume to touch either ivory or metals. The wheeler mu&s;t not, however qualified, extend his art beyond the ap|pointed bounds, &s;o as to encroach on the coach-maker, who is equally re&s;trained from making or mending either cart or waggon-wheel. The barber may &s;have, draw teeth, or bleed, but he mu&s;t not make wigs. It is the &s;ame with &s;hop-keepers as with mechanics, they mu&s;t confine them&s;elves to their proper articles; and, under no pretence, may the manufacturers open magazines to &s;ell by retail.</P>
<P>The incorporated fraternities in the kingdoms of Ca&s;tille and Arragon, are 25,581, and their ex|pences amount to near 12,000,000 of reals. This
<PB N="250" REF="253">
revenue is not con&s;umed, as with us, in fea&s;ting, but in procuring ma&s;&s;es either for departed &s;pirits, or for the benefit of the fraternity, in which each indivi|dual has an equal intere&s;t. For this rea&s;on the&s;e communities enjoy the protection of the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal courts, to which, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, they fre|quently appeal.</P>
<P>The chartered corporations claim their privileges by royal grant, and on this plea re&s;i&s;t a reformation, not con&s;idering, as <HI>Campomanes</HI> remarks, the e&s;&s;en|tial condition of the&s;e grants, that nothing therein contained, &s;hall be to the <HI>prejudice of others,</HI> or in|jurious to the citizens at large.</P>
<P>Similar to the former cau&s;es, as checking ma|nufactures, and thereby dimini&s;hing the population of a country, may be reckoned &s;umptuary laws. <HI>Baron Monte&s;quieu</HI> him&s;elf applies this remark to Spain, and facts certainly vindicate the ju&s;tice of his ob&s;ervations; for, had their dre&s;s been left to the whim and caprice of the inhabitants, the more delicate manufactures, which are now lo&s;t, would, by the certainty of a ready market, have been re|tained among them.</P>
<P>With &s;o many &s;ub&s;i&s;ting cau&s;es of depopulation, in vain did <HI>Philip IV.</HI> in 1623, offer a premium
<PB N="251" REF="254">
for marriage. In vain did he grant all the privi|leges of nobility to all new married men for four years. In vain did he deprive the nobles of their privileges, if unmarried at the age of 25; and offer all the exemptions belonging to nobility for life to the father of &s;ix children.</P>
<P>Should, however, the people take advantage of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is to a&s;&s;ert their freedom; &s;hould they, happy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one of the riche&s;t coun|tries upon earth, contract the bounds of their un|wieldy empire, and confine their views within the limits of their own penin&s;ula, cheri&s;h indu&s;|try, aboli&s;h their mona&s;tic orders, le&s;&s;en the num|ber of their fe&s;tivals, e&s;tabli&s;h an agrarian law, and &s;trike off the fetters by which their com|merce has been bound; we may venture to affirm that no country, of the &s;ame extent, would be more populous, more wealthy, or more power|ful, than Spain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Army, Military Orders, and Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spani&s;h infantry con&s;i&s;ts of 44 regiments, of two battalions each, without including tho&s;e of the Spani&s;h and Walloon guards, each containing 4,200 men, in &s;ix battalions. Of the&s;e 44 re|giments, 35 are Spani&s;h, two Italian, three Fle|mi&s;h, and four Swi&s;s. White or blue is the colour of their regimentals, except one Spani&s;h and three Iri&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed in red.</P>
<P>The&s;e 88 battalions, each of which ought to contain 684 men, would make the Spani&s;h infantry amount to about 60,000 men complete, which is very far from being the ca&s;e; and it has been a&s;|&s;erted, though perhaps without foundation, that Spain would find it difficult to bring into the field 30,000 effective men. It is however certain, that her infantry is not adequate to the great extent of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;ince garri&s;ons mu&s;t be left in Afri|ca, as well as &s;everal parts of her colonies. In 1776, it appears, that Spain had no le&s;s than 32
<PB N="253" REF="256">
battalions out of Europe, and, in 1782, 36 in Ame|rica alone.</P>
<P>The means of recruiting in Spain are very con|fined. The Spani&s;h people in general have a pecu|liar di&s;like to enli&s;t in the infantry. Every regi|ment finds it difficult to procure men, and they are obliged to beat up in tho&s;e places where mo&s;t dupes and libertines are a&s;&s;embled; thus tho&s;e who di&s;turb its repo&s;e are appointed to its defence. The &s;oldiers of the French regiments, impelled by their incon&s;tancy, take advantage of the neck of the Pyrenees, to go and engage them&s;elves to Spani&s;h recruiters. Foreign regiments in the &s;ervice of Spain, are particularly recruited at the expence of the French regiments. Thus all the inconvenience of the proximity of the re&s;pective garri&s;ons is on the &s;ide of France, and the court of Madrid is by no means de&s;irous of a cartel for exchanging de|&s;erters. It was thought &s;ufficient, in 1761, that each &s;hould agree to return the arms, hor&s;es, and baggage, of the &s;oldiers pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;ervice to the other.</P>
<P>Another mode of recruiting the Spani&s;h army, is that of the <HI>quintas,</HI> a kind of drawing of militia, different from that of France, though it is there in u&s;e, both for recruiting the army and the provincial regiments. The ordinance of 1705, enacts, "that
<PB N="254" REF="257">
for recruiting the regulars, lots &s;hall be drawn in each village, to chu&s;e one per&s;on our of five; but then the drawing of the militia is to be &s;u&s;pended." This is, no doubt, the etymology of the word <HI>quintas.</HI> As it frequently happens, the word remains, when the thing is changed. The <HI>quintas</HI> at pre&s;ent do not require &s;o great a number; and as the people have on &s;ome occa&s;ions murmured at this mode of recruiting, government re&s;orts to this expedient only in the la&s;t extremity. She had not recour&s;e to it in the la&s;t war, and the regiments employed at Mi|norca and Gibraltar, were compleated at the ex|pence of tho&s;e not in actual &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the 44 regiments of regular infantry, Spain has 42 of militia, di&s;tributed in the provinces of the crown of Ca&s;tille. The&s;e regiments are a&s;|&s;embled only for one month in the year, in the prin|cipal place of which they bear the name; and then the officers and &s;oldiers are paid; at all other times, they are di&s;per&s;ed in the villages, and follow their re&s;pective occupations. The&s;e regiments, which all con&s;i&s;t of one &s;ingle battalion of 720 men, except that of Majorca, which has two, mu&s;t always be complete. As &s;oon as a &s;oldier of the militia dies, de&s;erts, or is di&s;charged, lots are drawn in the vil|lage whence he was taken, to replace him.</P>
<P>The regiments of militia have a particular in|&s;pector.
<PB N="255" REF="258">
Their colonels are cho&s;en, as in England, from among the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed gentry of the di&s;trict; and their authority is very exten&s;ive over the men. They have the power of inflicting pu|ni&s;hments, and there is no appeal from their &s;en|tences, but to the King, through the medium of a council of war. Few &s;tates in Europe have &s;o well regulated a militia. The grenadiers of the&s;e regi|ments, are in time of war, united to the regular troops, and enjoy among their fellow ctizens, a re|putation, which their whole conduct, during the la&s;t war, ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h &s;oldiers have long been ju&s;tly re|nowned for their firm and per&s;evering courage, and the re&s;olution with which they &s;upport labour, fa|tigue, and hunger. Of the officers, it has been &s;aid, but with what foundation we do not pretend to de|termine, that their troops were not &s;o well com|manded as they ought to be. Spani&s;h officers, how|ever, have not the &s;ame means of forming them|&s;elves with the French. Mo&s;t of their garri&s;ons are &s;olitary and ill-provided, without re&s;ource either for in&s;truction or innocent plea&s;ures; the officers have not the privilege of the <HI>&s;eme&s;tres,</HI> or leave of ab&s;ence for &s;ix months every year, or every &s;econd year, as in France; neither can they but &s;eldom obtain leave of ab&s;ence to regulate their private affairs. This unvaried and in&s;ipid life, in the end ab&s;orbs the fa|culties,
<PB N="256" REF="259">
and de&s;troys activity, or diverts the mind to improper objects. It has, be&s;ides, the inconvenience of rendering the &s;ervice le&s;s de&s;irable, and keeping from it tho&s;e to whom a &s;maller fortune, or liberal education offer other re&s;ources.</P>
<P>The cavalry con&s;i&s;ts of 14 regiments, not includ|ing the brigade of carbiniers, rai&s;ed in 1730.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e regiments, &s;ix are in blue, four in red, three in white, and one in green.</P>
<P>The dragoons form eight regiments, of which one is in blue, one in red, and &s;ix in yellow. Each re|giment of cavalry is compo&s;ed of four &s;quadrons, which &s;hould contain 150 men. Were the regi|ments compleat, Spain would have an army of 13,000 hor&s;e. In time of peace, the 600 men, of which each regiment ought to be compo&s;ed, is re|duced to 480, and of this number, there are 80 men di&s;mounted.</P>
<P>This arrangement was made in 1768. The re&s;ult is, that the cavalry is le&s;s agreeable than it would otherwi&s;e be to the Spaniards, becau&s;e the new re|cruits remain three or four years on foot, waiting their turn to have &s;pare hor&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e defects, the Spani&s;h cavalry may be reckoned among the fine&s;t in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="260">The cavalry in Spain is not &s;o ea&s;ily mounted as it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, from the great celebrity of the Spani&s;h hor&s;es. The breed is &s;aid to be degenerated; this is attributed to the little care that has been taken to cro&s;s it, and particularly to the great num|ber of mules bred from &s;ome of the fine&s;t Spani&s;h mares.</P>
<P>Nature, which has &s;o liberally be&s;towed on Spain all the nece&s;&s;aries and luxuries of life, has been equally lavi&s;h in be&s;towing all the materials of which war compo&s;es the means of de&s;truction; &s;he has given iron in abundance, copper, lead, and &s;alt-petre; this country, therefore, need not be indebted to any other for the &s;upply of its artillery with the&s;e de&s;tructive trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h artillery is collected into one regi|ment, compo&s;ed of five battalions, without includ|ing the cadets. The corps of engineers are &s;epa|rated from the artillery. It con&s;i&s;ts of ten direc|tors, ten colonels, 20 lieutenant-colonels, 30 cap|tains, 40 lieutenants, and as many &s;ub-lieutenants; in all 150 officers.</P>
<P>According to &s;ome late regulations, no per&s;on can become an officer, without having been a cadet. The military &s;chool fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed at Avila, and &s;ince removed to <HI>Port S. Mary,</HI> is not &s;o much in|tended
<PB N="258" REF="261">
to in&s;truct &s;tudents in the fir&s;t elements of tactics, as to cultivate the di&s;po&s;itions of officers, who have the noble emulation of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves in the military profe&s;&s;ion. Nothing is omitted in this academy, which may conduce to that end; and it is perhaps the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the kind in Europe.</P>
<P>The kings of Spain have no more forgotten the declining years of military men, than their youth. There is a corps of invalids in Spain, as well for of|ficers as for &s;oldiers; but the 46 companies of which it is compo&s;ed, are di&s;tributed at Madrid, and in the provinces where they perform an ea&s;y duty. Tho&s;e incapable of all &s;ervice, form another corps of 26 companies.</P>
<P>The uniforms in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, &s;ays <HI>(Swin|burne,)</HI> are ugly and ill made; the &s;oldiers abomina|bly na&s;ty in their cloaths, and their black grea&s;y hair &s;eldom dre&s;t. Till very lately, they were commonly in rags, and often mounted guard with half a coat, and almo&s;t bare breeched; but now they are ra|ther better clad, and kept in a &s;omewhat more de|cent trim.</P>
<P>The pay of a &s;oldier is five quartos and an half, and 21 ounces of bread a day. After 15 years &s;er|vice, he has an increa&s;e of five reals a month; after
<PB N="259" REF="262">
20, 9 reals; and after 25, he may retire and receive a pezzetta per diem, and be cloathed, as if he was &s;till in actual &s;ervice. The pezzetta is four reals, a real is about three-pence Engli&s;h, and a quarto not quite a halfpenny. If the &s;oldier remains 30 years in the army, he is allowed the rank and pay of a &s;u|baltern officer. Every 40 months he receives new regimentals, two &s;hirts, two &s;tocks, one pair of &s;hoes, two pair of &s;tockings, a cap, and a hat.</P>
<P>The rank of any officer may be known at fir&s;t &s;ight, by a particular badge of di&s;tinction. A cap|tain-general's dre&s;s-uniform is blue, embroidered with gold down the &s;eams, and three rows of em|broidery on the &s;leeves: a lieutenant-general's has nothing on the &s;eams, and but two rows on the cuffs; a mari&s;cal de campo, but one: a brigadier has red cuffs, with one row of &s;ilver embroidery on his coat: a colonel has three narrow bindings on his &s;leeve, of the colour of his regimental button; a lieutenant-colonel, two; and a major, one; the mark of a captain is two epauletts; of a lieutenant, one on his right &s;houlder; and of an en&s;ign, one on the left.</P>
<P>The pay of a lieutenant is two pezzettas and a half per diem; that of an en&s;ign, two. As every thing is trebled in price &s;ince their pay was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, it is become in&s;ufficient for the maintenance
<PB N="260" REF="263">
of the officers. In the guards, all &s;ubalterns mu&s;t live upon their own fortune, till they get a company, which they may perhaps wait 30 years for.</P>
<P>In Spain there is no order of knighthood de&s;tined for the reward of military officers. The late &s;ove|reign impo&s;ed on him&s;elf a law, to confer on none but the&s;e, the four military orders. There are be|&s;ides the&s;e, other means of rewarding the old &s;er|vants of the crown, by pen&s;ions or employments ana|logous to their profe&s;&s;ion. His beneficence al&s;o ex|tends to their widows.</P>
<P>The place of commandant-general of a province, is an opening to general officers, but obliges them to an almo&s;t perpetual re&s;idence; for in Spain, bi&s;hops, intendants, governors and commanders re|&s;ide where they are employed, although the re&s;idence of the Sovereign and the capital have the &s;ame temptations for ambition and di&s;&s;ipation, as in other countries.</P>
<P>All the commandants of provinces, have the title of Captain-general, which, however, mu&s;t not be confounded with that of the fir&s;t military rank. They commonly receive, but from an abu&s;e, the title of Viceroy al&s;o, which properly belongs to none
<PB N="261" REF="264">
but the commandant, and tho&s;e of the principal provinces of Spani&s;h America.</P>
<P>We &s;hall in this place take occa&s;ion to give &s;ome account of the military orders in Spain, mo&s;t of which were created by the kings of Spain, during their continual wars again&s;t the Moors. Many of them are become extinct, which it may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to notice, before we &s;peak of tho&s;e which at pre&s;ent exi&s;t. Of the&s;e former are:</P>
<P>The order of the <HI>Green Oak,</HI> founded by <HI>Ximenes;</HI> that of the <HI>Fleur de lys,</HI> by <HI>Sancho IV.</HI> King of Na|varre; and the order of the <HI>Holy Saviour,</HI> by <HI>Al|phon&s;o VII.</HI> King of Arragon; the&s;e &s;hort lived or|ders are &s;carce worth remembering. But the order of the <HI>Flambeau</HI> is more de&s;erving notice, having been in&s;tituted in 1150, by <HI>Berenzer,</HI> la&s;t Count of Barcelona, in favour of the women of Torto&s;a, as a recompen&s;e of the valour they had &s;hewed the year before, in defence of their city again&s;t the Moors. The order no longer exi&s;ts, but the women of Tor|to&s;a &s;till enjoy &s;everal privileges granted at that time to their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The other non-exi&s;ting orders, are tho&s;e of <HI>Trux|illo;</HI> of <HI>S. Mary of Spain,</HI> of the <HI>Scarf;</HI> this order, perhaps, gave ri&s;e to all our blue, red, and green ribbons. It was founded by <HI>Alphon&s;o XII.</HI> in 1332,
<PB N="262" REF="265">
who gave it as a di&s;tingui&s;hing badge, a ribbon of the breadth of three fingers, which the knights wore over the right &s;houlder. Ten years military &s;ervice were a qualification to be admitted.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e in&s;tituted in 1383, the order of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and, what is &s;ingular, proofs of nobility were required as a qualification to be admitted. The di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the order, was a folded little en&s;ign, hung to the mantle by means of a chain.</P>
<P>The order of <HI>Burgundy</HI> is al&s;o reckoned among tho&s;e which have exi&s;ted in Spain, having been in|&s;tituted by <HI>Charles V.</HI> after his expedition to Tunis, in memory of that conque&s;t. The in&s;ignia of the order was a cro&s;s of Burgundy, compo&s;ed of two knotty &s;taffs, above which was the word <HI>Barbaria.</HI> Spain &s;till bears the cro&s;s in her flag.</P>
<P>Among the exi&s;ting orders of Spain, are tho&s;e of <HI>Alcantara, Calatrava, Santiago, Monte&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> and that of <HI>Charles III.</HI> The order of <HI>Alcan|tara</HI> was called the Noble; that of <HI>Calatrava,</HI> the Gallant, and that of <HI>Santiago,</HI> the Rich.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t four of the&s;e orders were founded at the time of the cru&s;ades; the king is grand-ma&s;ter of them all. The fir&s;t three are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a red ribbon, and the la&s;t by a green one. The&s;e four
<PB N="263" REF="266">
orders have commanderies, which are conferred by the King. They were for a long time given to every cla&s;s of per&s;ons who could bring the requi&s;ite proofs. The&s;e orders have each lands in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, to the amount of 200,000 ducats, and upwards, of annual rent.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing order in Spain, is that of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> founded by <HI>Philip the Good,</HI> Duke of Burgundy, and which the court of Vienna con|tinues to confer, in concurrence with that of Madrid; although the former had renounced this prerogative, by the treaty, which terminated the great quarrel between <HI>Philip V.</HI> and the <HI>Archduke.</HI> The collar of the order con&s;i&s;ts of an alternate range of gold flints and &s;teels, with &s;parks of fire on all &s;ides, and a Golden Fleece pendent from it with this motto, <HI>Autre n'aurai. Charles the Fifth,</HI> in&s;tead of the col|lar, permitted the knights to wear only a &s;carlet rib|bon. The number of knights of this order is very limited in Spain, and it is the order, which of all tho&s;e in Europe, has be&s;t pre&s;erved its ancient &s;plen|dor.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the order of <HI>Charles III.</HI> this mo|narch having pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf an irrevocable law, to be&s;tow the other orders on none but military men, an honourable di&s;tinction was wanting for the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects. This he &s;upplied in 1771, by

creating a fifth order. It is compo&s;ed of two cla&s;&s;es, that of the great cro&s;&s;es, and the &s;imple knights. The great cro&s;&s;es wear the great ribbon of the order, &s;ky blue, edged with white. Their number &s;hould be limited to 60. This order is confined to the mo&s;t eminent per&s;onages of the kingdom, &s;uch as the mini&s;ters and &s;ome general officers, di&s;tingui&s;hed ei|ther by their zeal or &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The &s;imple knights were 200 in number, each en|joying a pen&s;ion of about &pound;40. This le&s;&s;er order has &s;ince been be&s;towed on &s;ome per&s;ons in France, not reckoned in the original number.</P>
<P>Proofs of nobility are nece&s;&s;ary to this latter order, as well as to the four military orders. It is true, nobility in mo&s;t of the provinces in Spain, is not difficult to e&s;tabli&s;h. It is &s;ufficient, that he who a&s;|pires to this di&s;tinction, proves him&s;elf and his an|ce&s;tors to have lived nobly, without having exerci&s;ed any of the profe&s;&s;ions, few in number, which law and prejudice reckon vile; he is then reputed a gen|tleman by de&s;cent, <HI>hidalgo;</HI> for in Spain, nobility by creation, is unknown. Some humouri&s;ts have ob&s;erved, that there are whole provinces of which the inhabitants are gentlemen; nor is this any great ex|aggeration.</P>

all the Bi&s;cayans, and all the A&s;turians believe they are de&s;cended from the ancient Goths, who took re|fuge in the mountains of A&s;turia, and are reputed noble, on account of this honourable origin. But there cannot be a more ridiculous ab&s;urdity than to &s;uppo&s;e, that two or 300,000 men, &s;ettled &s;ome years ago in a &s;mall province, were all noble. If all men mea&s;ured five feet eight inches high, the words giant and dwarf would be obliterated from the dic|tionary. Nobility nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es a more nu|merous cla&s;s who are ignoble. Thus there are in Bi&s;cay and A&s;turia, di&s;tingui&s;hed families in the opi|nion of the public, who have made a great figure in the di&s;trict wherein they re&s;ide, either by their opu|lence or the places they have held, and whatever may be the pretentions of ob&s;cure neighbouring fa|milies, the former affect a pre-eminence, which the&s;e acknowledge by their homages; &s;o that if by chance they arrive at &s;ome employment of con&s;equence, they are le&s;s in&s;olent and vain, than mo&s;t up&s;tarts in other countries. This may be particularly remarked in the lower ranks of the A&s;turians and Bi&s;cayans. They have in their appearance &s;omething more haughty, and are le&s;s humble in their homages. They are not awed either by titles or riches. A man in place, is in their eyes a fortunate man, who has won in the royal lottery, in which they all have a ticket, and may win in their turn; and this pre|judice, (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) ridiculous as it may

&s;eem, keeps them again&s;t meanne&s;s and degrading crimes.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the navy of Spain, which is divided into three departments, tho&s;e of Ferrol, Carthagena, and Cadiz.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t has real inconveniences, from the un|healthine&s;s of the climate, the frequent rains which retard the operations in the port, and its being &s;o &s;i|tuated, that no ve&s;&s;el can &s;ail from it, but with a par|ticular wind.</P>
<P>The department of Carthagena has many advan|tages over that of Ferrol. The &s;afety of its harbour is known by an old proverb among &s;eamen, who &s;ay, 'there are but three good ports for ve&s;&s;els, the months of June and July, and the harbour of Car|thagena.' This &s;afety extends to the ar&s;enals and dock-yards, which, being in a narrow place, may, ac|cording to the expre&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h &s;ailors, be locked by a &s;ingle key. Carthagena, therefore, is the port where the greate&s;t number of &s;hips are built, caulked, and careened.</P>
<P>The department of Cadiz is, however, the mo&s;t important of the three, on account of its favourable &s;ituation for the departure of the fleets.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="270">The Spani&s;h navy is governed much in the &s;ame manner as that of France. In&s;tead of vice-admirals, there are captains-general. Immediately after the captains-general, rank the lieutenants-general, who are at pre&s;ent 17 in number, and the commodores 15. In the Spani&s;h navy, there is likewi&s;e an intermedi|ate rank between the&s;e and captains of ve&s;&s;els; that of brigadier. The&s;e are 40 in number. Of cap|tains of &s;hips there are 150; and of tho&s;e of fri|gates 152.</P>
<P>To acquire rank in the Spani&s;h navy, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to have pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>garde marine.</HI> This corps was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1717; it con&s;i&s;ts of three companies, each containing 92 cadets, for who&s;e in&s;truction there is an academy, compo&s;ed of a di|rector and eight profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The officers of the navy are, with re&s;pect to mi|litary rewards, upon a footing with tho&s;e of the army. The vice-royalties, governments of pro|vinces, or places in America, are indi&s;criminately given to general officers of the army and tho&s;e of the navy. But the officers of the Spani&s;h navy have many other means of enriching them&s;elves, which render the king's favours le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;ailors are cla&s;&s;ed as in France, and divided into three departments. The regi&s;ter of the cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="268" REF="271">
make the whole amount to 50,000. Spain has al&s;o, for the &s;ervice of her &s;hips of war, a marine infan|try, compo&s;ed of 12 battalions, con&s;i&s;ting of 168 men each, which form a corps of about 12,000 men.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a particular corps of artil|lery, of 2,595 men, for whom there are theoretical and practical &s;chools in each of the three depart|ments.</P>
<P>Spain has al&s;o a &s;ociety of pilots, with &s;chools of pilotage.</P>
<P>In 1764, the Spani&s;h navy con&s;i&s;ted of only 37 &s;hips of the line, and about 30 frigates. In 1770 there were 51 &s;hips, of from 58 to 112 guns. Their number has &s;ince increa&s;ed. Since the year 1776, according to <HI>Town&s;end,</HI> their navy has been more than doubled. In the &s;ummer of 1790, their fleet of ob&s;ervation con&s;i&s;ted of 28 &s;hips of the line, among which were four &s;hips of 112 guns; be&s;ides the&s;e, they had &s;ix &s;hips of the line &s;tationed in the Mediterra|nean, and a &s;trong fleet in America.</P>
<P>"It is a que&s;tion worthy of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion (&s;ays the above writer) whether Spain ought to aim at being di&s;tingui&s;hed as a naval power. Should &s;he adhere to the coloni&s;ing &s;y&s;tem, a powerful navy will be
<PB N="269" REF="272">
needful to protect her commeroe, and &s;ecure her monopolies; but then it &s;hould be enquired, if the proportion of trade obtained, beyond what &s;he would enjoy if the&s;e di&s;tant provinces were free, pays the expence of arming in times of peace, or indemnifies her for all the commercial wars &s;he may be engaged in, to &s;upport her trade.</P>
<P>The three divi&s;ions, in Europe, of the navy of Spain, are not the only places where &s;hips of war are built. There are dock-yards in the Havannah, and a fund of 700,000 pia&s;tres was &s;ome time &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed to carry on the works.</P>
<P>Spain and her colonies might furni&s;h her navy with all the &s;hip-timber nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. There are great quantities in the mountains of A&s;tu|ria and Navarre; and particularly in the Pyrenees on the &s;ide of Arragon and Catalonia, there is a &s;pecies of pine more &s;olid and durable than oak. The plain of Cuba contains many cedars, although it has been thought exhau&s;ted by the quantities drawn from the country adjacent to the coa&s;t. In tho&s;e of Cumana there is timber, likewi&s;e, fit for &s;hip-building. But Spain has not derived all the advantages &s;he might have done from the&s;e re&s;ources, and con&s;tantly depends on the northern &s;tates, at lea&s;t for a &s;upply of ma&s;ts. From the account given to the public by the bank of <HI>S. Charles,</HI> for
<PB N="270" REF="273">
the year 1785, it appears, that upwards of 8,500,000 reals were paid, that year, for ma&s;ts alone, im|ported from the North. They are &s;till nearer the time of being independent of other powers for the hemp nece&s;&s;ary for their navy. This they received for many years from the North; but at pre&s;ent, mo&s;t of the cordage, cables, and &s;ail-cloth, u&s;ed in Spain, are made from hemp grown in the country.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have al&s;o adopted, from the Eng|li&s;h, the method of &s;heathing the bottom of their men of war with copper; but, for want of know|ing how to prepare the copper from Mexico, they have hitherto imported all their &s;heets of that metal from Trie&s;te and Sweden.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances prove, that Spain po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es within her&s;elf every thing nece&s;&s;ary to her navy; and that, after having long neglected the&s;e benefactions of nature, &s;he now makes &s;ucce&s;sful efforts to render it independent of other nations.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIII.</HI> The Bull-fights.</HEAD>
<P>THE bull-fights principally &s;eem to be &s;ome remains of barbari&s;m in the Spaniards, but at the &s;ame time they are more &s;u&s;ceptible of apology. The&s;e combats, to which the Spani&s;h nation has the &s;tronge&s;t attachment, though highly repugnant to the delicacy of the re&s;t of Europe, are con&s;idered by the Spaniards as means of pre&s;erving in the na|tion the energy by which it is characteri&s;ed. "For my part (&s;ays <HI>Bourgoanne</HI>) though I wi&s;h to re&s;pect a ta&s;te by no means in uni&s;on with my own, I have never been able to comprehend what relation there is to &s;trength and courage in a &s;pectacle where tho&s;e pre&s;ent are expo&s;ed to no danger, and in which the actors prove, by the rarity of accidents, that the ha|zards they run, are not of a nature to excite much concern." "Whatever may be &s;aid to the contrary, (&s;ays the above writer) accidents, are very rare. The cavaliers, who are thrown, &s;ometimes receive contu&s;ions, but, during almo&s;t four years that I was
<PB N="272" REF="275">
pre&s;ent at their bull-fights, I knew but one that died of his wounds. A prie&s;t, however, provided with the <HI>viaticum,</HI> and holy oils, is always pre&s;ent, in a kind of latticed box, a precaution, notwith|&s;tanding its inutility, that has been kept up merely by the force of cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The price of admi&s;&s;ion varies very much, accord|ing as the places are covered or expo&s;ed, in the &s;un or in the &s;hade. A box for the day, which will con|veniently accommodate eight or ten people in the &s;hade, will co&s;t &pound;3. 12<HI>s.</HI> but in the &s;un only half that &s;um; and, between both, &pound;2. 8<HI>s.</HI> Fa&s;hionable people take a box. A &s;eat, if covered, in the &s;hade, and in the front bench, co&s;ts 7<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> for the day; but a back &s;eat in the&s;e covered benches, on the &s;unny &s;ide of the theatre, is not quite half that &s;um. The cheape&s;t &s;eat for the day, expo&s;ed to all the inclemency of the weather, to rain, if it &s;hould rain, and to the overwhelming heat of the &s;ummer's &s;un, is &s;omething more than 1<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tated expences are enormous. At Madrid they are calculated at from three to &pound;400; the per|&s;ons who fight the bulls receiving from three to &pound;15 each. The average receipts are &s;tated at near &pound;700. The balance forms the principal funds for the &s;upport of the General Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="276">Bull-fights are mo&s;tly given in &s;ummer, becau&s;e &s;pectators may then remain in the open air; and in that &s;ea&s;on of the year the bulls are more vigorous. There are 20 benches round the circle, and that only which is mo&s;t elevated is covered. The boxes are in the upper part of the edifice. In &s;ome cities, as in Valladolid, where there are no particular places &s;et apart for the combat, the great &s;quare is con|verted into a theatre for the purpo&s;e. The balco|nies of the different &s;tories are continued acro&s;s the ends of the &s;treets which there terminate. The &s;ight of the people, of every cla&s;s, a&s;&s;embled round the &s;quare, impatiently expecting the &s;ignal of battle, and exhibiting in their countenance every &s;ign of joy, has in it &s;omething intere&s;ting, if not plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The exhibition begins by a kind of proce&s;&s;ion round the &s;quare, in which the champions make their appearance, as well tho&s;e on hor&s;eback as tho&s;e on foot; after them come two alguazils, gravely advancing, in wigs and black robes, who go to the governor for an order to begin. The &s;ignal is immediately given. The animal, until then &s;hut up in a kind of cabin, the door of which opens into the circle, is let out.</P>
<P>The bull, on his appearance, is received and &s;tunned with the cries and &s;houts of the people.
<PB N="274" REF="277">
He has fir&s;t to combat with the hor&s;emen <HI>(Picador|res)</HI> who, cloathed after the ancient manner of the Spaniards, wait for him, with long lances. This exerci&s;e, which requires addre&s;s, &s;trength and courage, has nothing in it degrading. Formerly the fir&s;t nobility did not di&s;dain to take a part in it; at pre&s;ent even &s;ome <HI>hidalgos</HI> &s;olicit the honor of fighting on hor&s;eback, and are &s;ometimes previou&s;ly pre&s;ented to the people, under the au&s;pices of a pa|tron, who is generally one of the principal per&s;ons of the court. The bull, without being provoked, frequently attacks them, which, when it happens, gives the &s;pectators a high opinion of his courage. But if the animal is pacific, di&s;concerted, and cow|ardly, runs round the circle, avoiding his per&s;ecu|tors; murmurs and hi&s;&s;ings re&s;ound throughout the theatre: all tho&s;e within who&s;e reach he pa&s;&s;es, load him with blows and execrations. It &s;eems as if he were a common enemy, who had a great crime to expiate, or a victim who&s;e &s;acrifice is of con&s;e|quence to all the people. If nothing can rouze his courage, he is judged unworthy of being tormented by men, and the repeated cries of <HI>petros, petros,</HI> bring on him new enemies.</P>
<P>Great dogs are then let loo&s;e upon him, who &s;eize him by the neck and ears. The animal now finds the u&s;e of his natural weapons. The dogs, thrown up in the air, fall &s;tunned, and &s;ometimes
<PB N="275" REF="278">
lacerated, upon the ground; but they ri&s;e, renew the combat, and commonly overpower their adver|&s;ary, who thus peri&s;hes ignobly. If he pre&s;ents him&s;elf with a good grace, the fir&s;t act of the tra|gedy belongs to the combatants on hor&s;eback; this is the mo&s;t animated, but the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting part of the whole. The animal then falls furiou&s;ly upon the innocent hor&s;e, and generally gores his &s;ides, and throws him and his rider on the ground.</P>
<P>The latter then is in imminent danger, until the combatants on foot, called <HI>chulos,</HI> come to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and provoke the bull, by &s;haking before him &s;tuffs of different colours. But it is not with|out danger to them&s;elves that they &s;ave the di&s;|mounted hor&s;eman. The bull &s;ometimes pur&s;ues them, and they then have need of their utmo&s;t agi|lity. They frequently e&s;cape him by letting fall the &s;tuff, which is their only weapon, and upon which the fury of the deceived animal exhau&s;ts him|&s;elf. But it &s;ometimes happens he is not thus to be impo&s;ed upon; and the champion has no other re&s;ource than leaping over the barrier, &s;ix feet high, which forms the interior of the circle. In &s;ome places there are two barriers, but where there is but one, the bull makes efforts to leap it, which he &s;ometimes accompli&s;hes. The alarm of the neare&s;t &s;pectators may ea&s;ily be imagined, and their preci|pitation in retiring, and crowding upon the upper
<PB N="276" REF="279">
benches, becomes more fatal to them than the fury of the animal; who, finding him&s;elf hampered in the narrow and uneven &s;pace, rather thinks of &s;a|ving him&s;elf than &s;atisfying his vengeance. Except in the&s;e ca&s;es, which are rare, the bull returns to the charge.</P>
<P>When it has been judged he is &s;ufficiently tor|mented by the combatants on hor&s;eback, the&s;e withdraw, and leave him to the champions on foot, called <HI>banderillos,</HI> who meet him, and, the moment he attacks them, &s;tick into him, two by two, a <HI>banderilla,</HI> ornamented with little &s;treamers of &s;tain|ed paper. The fury of the bull is redoubled; he roars, and his vain efforts render more acute the darts which have been lodged in him. This la&s;t torment gives a fine opportunity for the di&s;play of the agility of his new adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>When the vigour of the bull appears almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted, and the blood gu&s;hes from every wound, the Pre&s;ident then gives the &s;ignal for his death, which is announced by the &s;ound of drums and trumpets. The <HI>matador</HI> advances, and is &s;een alone in the circle. In one hand he holds a long knife, in the other a kind of flag, which he waves before his adver&s;ary. Thus together they &s;top, and ob|&s;erve each other. The impetuo&s;ity of the bull is &s;everal times avoided by the agility of the <HI>matador,</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="280">
and the plea&s;ure of the &s;pectators rendered more lively by their &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Sometimes the animal re|mains immoveable, he &s;crapes the ground with his feet, and &s;eems to meditate vengeance. The bull in this &s;ituation, and the <HI>matador,</HI> who di&s;covers his intention, and carefully ob&s;erves his &s;lighte&s;t mo|tion, form a picture, which an able pencil might not di&s;dain to delineate. At length the <HI>matador</HI> gives the fatal blow; and, if the animal immediately falls, the triumph of the conqueror is celebrated by a thou&s;and exclamations; but if the blow be not deci&s;ive, their murmurs are not le&s;s numerous. The <HI>matador,</HI> who&s;e addre&s;s was about to be extol|led to the &s;kies, is con&s;idered as a clum&s;y butcher. He in&s;tantly endeavours to recover from his di&s;grace, and di&s;arm the &s;everity of his judges. At la&s;t he gives a better directed blow. The animal vomits &s;treams of blood, and, &s;truggling with death, &s;tag|gers and falls, while his conqueror becomes intoxi|cated with the applau&s;e of the people. The bull is then tied by the horns, and ignominiou&s;ly dragged from the circle he has ju&s;t honoured, leaving no|thing but the traces of his blood, and the remem|brance of his exploit, which is &s;oon effaced by the appearance of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. On each of the days dedicated to the&s;e fea&s;ts are &s;acrificed, at lea&s;t at Madrid, &s;ix bulls in the morning, and 12 in the af|ternoon. The names of the combatants of each are previou&s;ly announced in the public prints.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281">The day on which the&s;e bull-fights are celebrated is a day of rejoicing for the whole di&s;trict, and for ten or 12 leagues round. The arti&s;t who can &s;carce provide for his exi&s;tence, has always a &s;ur|plus to expend on this &s;pectacle. "Whatever they may have been in former times (&s;ays <HI>Swinburne</HI>) they are certainly but a poor exhibition at pre&s;ent, though the crowds of people a&s;&s;embled in a circle, and agitated in a mo&s;t tumultuous manner, form an intere&s;ting and curious &s;pectacle. None of the royal family ever appear at the&s;e favourite amu&s;e|ments of the Spani&s;h nation; the nobility no longer pique them&s;elves in the&s;e rough exerci&s;es; and the fair conde&s;cend to yield up their hearts and per&s;ons to tho&s;e that have given no proofs of their prowe&s;s, but in combats of a &s;ofter nature.</P>
<P>The reigning Monarch, who endeavours to poli&s;h the manners of his &s;ubjects, has confined the num|ber of bull-fights to tho&s;e of which the produce &s;erves to the &s;upport of &s;ome charitable in&s;titution. The combats, by this means rendered le&s;s frequent, will perhaps lo&s;e, by degrees, a part of their attrac|tion, till circum&s;tances &s;hall permit them to be en|tirely aboli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE KINGDOM OF PORTUGAL, <HI>From BARETTI, FIELDING, and others.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Country, Climate, Mountains, Rivers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country was formerly called Lu&s;itania, but its boundaries then were very different from what they are at pre&s;ent. The name of Portugal is by &s;ome thought to &s;ignify <HI>Portus Gallus,</HI> or <HI>Portus Gallorum,</HI> from the great number of French who came to the city of Porto, on the river Douro, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Moors. Others, with more probability, derive it from a town on the river Douro, by the ancients called Cale, but by the moderns changed to Gaya. Oppo&s;ite to this place &s;ome of the inhabitants afterwards built a new town with a harbour, and gave it the name of Portucale, or the harbour of Cale, which by un|interrupted
<PB N="280" REF="283">
pro&s;perity, proved the origin of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing city of Porto; and from hence the whole country has received the name of Por|tugal.</P>
<P>This kingdom, which is the mo&s;t we&s;tern part of Europe, is bounded on the &s;outh and we&s;t by the Atlantic ocean; and on the north and ea&s;t by Spain. Its length, from Valencia, the mo&s;t northern town, to Sagnes, the mo&s;t &s;outhern, near Cape S. Vincent, is about 300 miles; and its greate&s;t breadth, from Peniche, a &s;ea-port, in E&s;tremadura, to Salva|terra, on the frontiers of Spain, is about 100 miles.</P>
<P>The ancient inhabitants of this country were the <HI>Turdetani.</HI> The Carthaginians and Romans &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Lu&s;itania, as it was then called; the latter being driven out by the Suevi, who did not enjoy it long, they being, in their turn, con|quered by the Goths, who kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country and Spain, till they were driven out by the Moors. It was afterwards taken from them by the Chri&s;tians, of Gothic extraction.</P>
<P>The climate of Portugal is much more temperate than that of Spain, although with &s;ome variation in the different provinces. The northern parts expe|rience a kind of painful cold in winter, chiefly owing to the heavy rains which fall in that &s;ea&s;on.
<PB N="281" REF="284">
In the &s;outhern parts of Portugal the &s;ummer heats are very violent. Both winter and &s;ummer, how|ever, are very &s;upportable; cooling &s;ea-breezes re|fre&s;hing the air, during the latter &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;pring is extremely delightful.</P>
<P>This country is in many parts mountainous. From the mountains i&s;&s;ue &s;everal &s;treams, and &s;mall rivers, which fertilize the vallies and fields; and either join the greater rivers in their cour&s;e, or di&s;|charge them&s;elves &s;eparately into the &s;ea. The large&s;t and principal of the&s;e are the following:</P>
<P>The Minho, having its &s;ource in Gallicia, and emptying it&s;elf into the We&s;tern or Atlantic ocean, not far from the town of Caminha.</P>
<P>The Lima, by the ancients called al&s;o <HI>Lethe,</HI> or the <HI>River of Forgetfulne&s;s.</HI> The <HI>Turduli</HI> and <HI>Celtae,</HI> after lo&s;ing their general, &s;ettled on the banks of this river, as if they had totally forgot their own country. This al&s;o takes its &s;ource in Gallicia, fall|ing into the &s;ea, below Viana.</P>
<P>The Douro, at the mouth of which &s;tands the city of Oporto, &s;o famous for its red wine. The &s;ource of this river is in Old Ca&s;tille. The waters of it are &s;aid formerly to have contained &s;o much

<P>The Tagus has its &s;ource in the frontiers of Arra|gon. This is the large&s;t and principal river in the whole kingdom. In Portugal it is joined by &s;everal rivers, widening greatly towards its mouth, &s;o as to form &s;everal i&s;lands, and a con&s;iderable harbour at Li&s;bon, a little beyond which it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea. In &s;ome places it overflows, and in|crea&s;es the fertilty of the adjacent country. This river al&s;o affords gold.</P>
<P>The Guadiana, in Latin the Anas, ri&s;es in New Ca&s;tille, and, entering Bagadoz in Portugal, lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ea, near Ayrmonte and Ca&s;tro Maxim. Its name &s;ignifies the river Anas, Guadi, in the Moori&s;h tongue, denoting a river.</P>
<P>All the&s;e rivers abound in fi&s;h, and the three principal, the Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadia|na, divide the kingdom into three parts.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable mountains are the <HI>Sierra d' E&s;trella,</HI> and the rocky mountain of Cintra. The former, called by the ancients, <HI>Mons Herminius,</HI> lies between the provinces of Beires and Tralos Montes: on the top of this mountain are two large lakes, one of which is &s;aid to be unfathomable,

and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a communication with the &s;ea, from wrecks of &s;hips having been found in it, and from its water being always rough and agitated when the adjoining ocean is &s;o. Cinta, called by the ancients <HI>Promontorium Lunae,</HI> or the Mountain of the Moon, is &s;ituated upon a point of land, five leagues to the we&s;tward of Li&s;bon, and called by the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, the Rock of Li&s;bon. On this promontory is a mona&s;tery, hewn out of the &s;olid rock. "When we came in view of this mountain, (&s;ays <HI>Barretti</HI>) I was told by one of the &s;ailors, it was the cu&s;tom to duck every per&s;on in the &s;ea, on his fir&s;t &s;ight of this rock, except he paid for|feit for &s;ome other to undergo the operation in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>On the highe&s;t pinnacle of this mountain the ancients built a temple, dedicated to the Moon, under the appellation of Cynthia, from whence comes the modern appellation of Cintra: and there is certainly not a &s;pot on the globe where a&s;trono|mical ob&s;ervations might be made to more advan|tage; whether we con&s;ider the great height, and &s;erenity of the atmo&s;phere, or the exten&s;ive horizon, joined to the mo&s;t commanding and unbounded pro&s;pect of the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>Upon this mountain are the remains of a palace belonging to the Moori&s;h kings. There are &s;till
<PB N="284" REF="287">
three of its halls to be &s;een. The ceilings are di|vided into &s;mall compartments, having animals painted on them. One ceiling contains nothing but &s;wans, another nothing but &s;tags, and the third nothing but magpies. Neither are the attitudes varied. Each &s;wan has a golden chain round his neck. Every &s;tag &s;upports a coat of arms on his back; and the magpies have the words <HI>per ben</HI> writ|ten over them. Upon the adjacent hills are a great number of villas belonging to the Portugue&s;e nobles, and the Engli&s;h merchants. Not far from the ba&s;e of the mountain, is a &s;pot of ground of about three miles in length, and one in breadth, entirely planted with oranges and lemons, who&s;e flowers, when they are in bloom, perfume a va&s;t tract of country. It is called the valley of Collares, and compared to the garden of Eden from its luxuriance.</P>
<P>The mountains of Portugal are &s;ome of the mo&s;t barren on the continent, except towards the ba&s;e, where they are in general well planted with vine-yards, which yield great quantities of excellent wine. Some mineral &s;prings have been di&s;covered in this country, but they are not made any u&s;e of, except|ing the baths of Caldas in E&s;tremadura, which are famed for their virtues in venereal ca&s;es. Though the&s;e baths are in &s;o much repute, the accommoda|tions to be met with at them, are but very indiffer|ent. They lie 15 leagues north of Li&s;bon.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="288">Although the &s;oil be very fruitful, &s;o much is a|griculture neglected here, that above half the coun|try lies wa&s;te; and the inhabitants are &s;upplied with a great part of their corn by importation. Portugal, however, abounds in excellent wine and oil; the greate&s;t part of the oil is made in the province of Alentejo. Olive trees thrive better near the &s;ea, than up in the country. Here is al&s;o great plenty of fine honey, and con&s;equently of wax. The be&s;t honey, which is found in the fields, is almo&s;t of a white co|lour, and of a mo&s;t agreeable flavour; and the wild honey here is more agreeable to the ta&s;te, than that of other countries. Portugal al&s;o produces abun|dance of lemons, pomegranates, oranges, figs, rai|&s;ins, almonds, che&s;nuts, and other fine fruits. It has likewi&s;e variety of &s;ea and river fi&s;h, and large quan|tities of &s;alt. Their &s;weet oranges are &s;aid to be &s;ome of the be&s;t in Europe. As Portugal is not without excellent pa&s;tures, the graziery in &s;ome places is very con&s;iderable, and an uncommon number of &s;heep and cattle may occa&s;ionally be &s;een; but in ge|neral it is at &s;o low an ebb, that the greate&s;t part of their oxen come from Spain. Their hor&s;es are not large, but very fleet. The Portugue&s;e, however, breed more a&s;&s;es than hor&s;es, the latter being clan|de&s;tinely imported from Spain. There is &s;carce any country where more marmalade is made, both of the white and red &s;ort, as likewi&s;e great quantities of odo|riferous waters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Cities.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole kingdom contains &s;ix provinces, 19 civdades or cities, and 527 villas or &s;maller towns. The number of inhabitants may be pretty nearly computed, and is calculated at 2,000,000 of people. Of its cities we &s;hall notice Li&s;bon and Operto, which are the two principal ones.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon, the metropolis of the kingdom, extends from ea&s;t to we&s;t along the river Tagus, near its in|flux into the &s;ea; re&s;embling an amphitheatre, and containing within its circuit &s;even mountains. The length of the whole city, is indeed, little &s;hort of two miles, and its breadth is incon&s;iderable. The val|lies of the&s;e mountains, form &s;treets of above a mile in length; but mo&s;t of them are very narrow, ill paved, and dirty; and many of them al&s;o &s;teep and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Though Li&s;bon, (&s;ays <HI>Fielding</HI>) in his account of this city, is &s;aid to be built on the &s;ame number of hills as ancient Rome; yet the&s;e do not all appear from the water; on the contrary, one &s;ees from

thence one va&s;t high hill and rock, with buildings ari&s;ing one above another, and that in &s;o &s;teep, and almo&s;t perpendicular a manner, that they all &s;eem to have but one foundation.</P>
<P>As the hou&s;es, churches, convents, &amp;c. are large, and all built with white &s;tone, they look very beau|tiful at a di&s;tance; but as you approach nearer, all idea of beauty vani&s;hes. While &s;urveying the pro&s;|pect of this city, which bears &s;o little re&s;emblance to any in England, a reflection occurred to me, that if a man was &s;uddenly to be removed from Palmyra hither, and &s;hould take a view of no other city, in how glorious a light would the ancient architecture appear to him? and what de&s;olation and de&s;truction of arts and &s;ciences would he conclude had happened between the &s;everal aeras of the&s;e cities?</P>
<P>All the &s;treets (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) laid out and built &s;ince the earthquake, in 1755, are &s;trait, regular, and mo&s;tly &s;pacious, running at right angles to each other; but the hou&s;es are in general too high in pro|portion to the width of the &s;treets; for which rea|&s;on, the falling of the hou&s;es upon the fir&s;t great &s;hock of any future earthquake, mu&s;t inevitably bury under their ruins, tho&s;e who &s;hall be able to e&s;cape into the &s;treets.</P>
<P>To form &s;ome connected idea of its &s;ituation,
<PB N="288" REF="292">
imagine an extent of &s;hore upon a &s;pacious river, capable of receiving every kind of &s;hipping, and pouring its waters immediately into the Atlantic, with regard to its local &s;ituation, far preferable to every other on the continent of Europe, for the mo&s;t extended traffic with the whole continent of America.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon, (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) is pretty nearly in the &s;ame ruinous &s;tate it was in after the earthquake in 1755. There are many new buildings carrying on, but the &s;treets are yet, in various places, &s;topped up with the ruins occa&s;ioned by that calamity. This city is built on &s;even &s;teep hills, and the &s;treets are very badly paved with &s;mall &s;harp &s;tones, which renders walk|ing almo&s;t impracticable; and at night, as there is no kind of light in the&s;e &s;treets, it would not be pru|dent for a &s;tranger to walk out alone. The hou&s;es are generally two &s;tories high, &s;ometimes three, with no other chimney but that of the kitchen; they are built of a kind of half marble, with iron balconies, and wooden latices to the ground floor, but they are not remarkable for architecture.</P>
<P>The new &s;treets are built on the &s;pot where the royal palace &s;tood before it was demoli&s;hed by the earthquake. On each &s;ide of the&s;e new &s;treets, is a foot-path, elevated &s;omewhat above the pavement, and defended from carriages by &s;tone po&s;ts. The&s;e
<PB N="889" REF="293">
hou&s;es are four and five &s;tories high. The exchange is fini&s;hed, and is near the river, with porticos under which the merchants a&s;&s;emble. This building forms one &s;ide of an intended &s;quare, in the mid&s;t of which is to be placed an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of the late king. The pede&s;tal is of a &s;ingle &s;tone, and required 80 yoke of oxen to drag it from the quarry, about two miles di&s;tant from the &s;pot where it now is.</P>
<P>The King's palace &s;tands on the river, and is both &s;pacious and convenient. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of it is a large &s;quare for the bull fights; and not far from it are the naval magazines. The ar&s;enal is a very large building: near it &s;tands the fi&s;h market, which is &s;uperior to tho&s;e in Holland. It is plentifully &s;upplied with fi&s;h, mo&s;t of them unknown in Eng|land; but with neither &s;almon nor cod: the former of which the inhabitants procure from Oporto, by men employed for the purpo&s;e, who perform the journey in four days on foot, taking the &s;horte&s;t route, without regarding the common roads, and deliver each fi&s;h at Li&s;bon for a moidore. The John-dory is to be met with larger here, than in the we&s;tern coa&s;t of England; as likewi&s;e are red mul|lets. The conger eels are very large, and the &s;cates will &s;ometimes mea&s;ure &s;even feet from the head, to the extremity of the tail. Near this market are al&s;o &s;old vegetables, fruits, tortoi&s;es, monkies, parrots, and Brazil birds.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="294">The churches of Li&s;bon are in general very fine; but that belonging to the Patriarchate is of a&s;toni&s;h|ing magnificence. The very ornaments and plate in it containing the trea&s;ure of &s;everal Bra&s;il fleets. The pomp a&s;&s;umed by the Patriarch on fe&s;tivals, &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es even that of the Pope, if we except only the college of cardinals.</P>
<P>The convents and colleges are fifty in number; 32 for monks, and 18 for nuns. The garden of the convent <HI>Das Nece&s;&s;idades,</HI> immediately under the hill of <HI>Buenos Aynes,</HI> is a very fine one, and is open to the decent part of the public. In one of the &s;ub|urbs of Li&s;bon, is a convent, over the door of which the arms of England and Portugal are hewn in &s;tone, party per pale, the lion and unicorn for &s;upporters, with the royal crown on the top. One of the&s;e con|vents is called the Engli&s;h nunnery, becau&s;e no per|&s;on is admitted into it, who is not born of Engli&s;h parents. Any lady left de&s;titute in England, and willing to devote her&s;elf to cha&s;tity and retirement, need not fear the approaches of real want for the re|mainder of her life, if &s;he once gets admittance here. The number of the nuns amounts to 22 or 23, and it is the chief anxiety of this little community, to keep the number complete, le&s;t government &s;hould in|troduce any Portugue&s;e among them, which might de&s;troy the harmony of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="295">The King allows them &s;uch a &s;um as furni&s;hes them all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The minute &s;uper|fluities, called by the French <HI>douceurs,</HI> &s;o indi&s;pen&s;a|ble to render exi&s;tence comfortable, are left to their own indu&s;try. The&s;e they procure, partly by work, and partly by trifling pre&s;ents often returned with li|berality.</P>
<P>Whoever can &s;peak Engli&s;h, be he catholic or prote&s;tant, has a kind of right to vi&s;it them at any hour of the day, and all their vi&s;itors are treated by them with &s;uch endearing kindne&s;s, that their parla|tory is &s;carce ever empty.</P>
<P>Nuns in all countries are &s;oft and obliging &s;peak|ers, but the&s;e (&s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI>) are the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t obliging that ever I met with. Not a &s;yllable i&s;|&s;ued from their lips, that was not dictated by mo|de&s;ty and meekne&s;s, humility and benevolence. Their virtue is to all appearance, without the lea&s;t alloy; but were they in reality different from what they appear, &s;till the &s;trong appearance of their innocence and goodne&s;s is irre&s;i&s;tibly attracting.</P>
<P><HI>Baretti</HI> relates an anecdote of the abbe&s;s of this nunnery, Lady <HI>Hill,</HI> which de&s;erves to be recorded, as &s;hewing what fidelity to an onerous engagement was found in a female brea&s;t. This lady took the veil here, from her circum&s;tances, perhaps, not per|mitting
<PB N="292" REF="296">
her to make a more agreeable choice. Soon after a large e&s;tate in Ireland devolved to her, as next of kin by the death of a relation who died in|te&s;tate.</P>
<P>To get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this e&s;tate, without her going to Ireland, was thought difficult, and &s;ubject to much inconvenience. Her ca&s;e, therefore, was repre&s;ented to the Patriarch, who alone had the power to di&s;|pen&s;e with her vow of con&s;tant confinement; and the Patriarch, by no means a rigid bigot, upon a &s;imple promi&s;e of returning, gave her leave to &s;e|cularize her dre&s;s and depart. She did &s;o, went to Ireland, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, and found her|&s;elf at once in a condition to live at ea&s;e and even in &s;plendour in her native country.</P>
<P>The temptation of &s;taying where &s;he was, it mu&s;t be allowed, was almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible, e&s;pecially when it is added, that &s;he was hand&s;ome and not yet 23. However, if &s;he was tempted, &s;he was tempted in vain; for &s;he &s;old the e&s;tate as &s;peedily as &s;he could, and faithful to her vow and her promi&s;e, ha&s;|tened back to the nunnery with the money, which &s;he laid out in &s;uch a manner, as contributed much to the ea&s;e and convenience of her beloved commu|nity. This was done by a woman! Would any friar in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, have behaved &s;o no|bly, and returned to his le&s;s heavy fetters, after &s;o
<PB N="293" REF="297">
lucky an e&s;cape? Her companions, &s;truck with ad|miration as well as gratitude, cho&s;e her immediately for their &s;uperior, and never after cea&s;ed to pay her the veneration &s;o indi&s;putably due to her un&s;haken virtue.</P>
<P>There is a theatre in this city for Italian operas; the principal female &s;inger in which, (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>)) appeared daily on the &s;tage, bedecked with jewels to the amount of 3 or 4,000 pounds. The other the|atre is for Portugue&s;e plays; there are four rows of boxes, and 27 boxes in each row. The Italian hou&s;e is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize. The &s;eats in the pit are appropriated &s;olely to the men. The admittance money to the opera is &s;omething more than half-a-crown.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h factory have two long rooms here, in which they a&s;&s;emble twice a week during the winter, to dance and play at cards. Any Briti&s;h &s;tranger who does not intend to re&s;ide &s;ix months in Li&s;bon, is ad|mitted gratis to the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies; but the &s;ub&s;crip|tion for re&s;idents is &s;even moidores for each room. The&s;e &s;ocieties have &s;ince been united, and a large room is built for that purpo&s;e. During the winter, there are four grand balls with &s;uppers, to which many of the Portugue&s;e nobility are invited.</P>

<P>It is very difficult to a&s;certain the number of inha|bitants in Li&s;bon: the different foreign factories not being numbered with the natives. The Engli&s;h factory alone, is computed at 600 &s;ouls. The Dutch and German factories con&s;i&s;t al&s;o of a very great number of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Previous to the earthquake, the atte&s;tations &s;ent to Rome in order to procure <HI>bulls,</HI> a&s;&s;igned 600,000 inhabitants to the metropolis. The earthquake, which happened on the fir&s;t of November 1755, is &s;aid by &s;ome, to have de&s;troyed 15,000 per&s;ons, by others 24,000, by others 70,000; indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate this lo&s;s with exactne&s;s. Li&s;bon may certainly be cla&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent among the fir&s;t cities for &s;ize and populou&s;ne&s;s, and po&s;&s;ibly may be ranked as the fourth, the other three being London, Paris, and Naples.</P>
<P>The King had two palaces in Li&s;bon, and they were both de&s;troyed. Yet none of the royal family peri&s;hed. They were going from Li&s;bon to Belem, and at the time were in a part of the road where there
<PB N="295" REF="299">
was no hou&s;e near. Had they remained a quarter of an hour longer in Li&s;bon, or arrived a quarter of an hour &s;ooner in Belem, it is probable they would have peri&s;hed, as the royal palace at Belem was likewi&s;e de&s;troyed. King, Queen, Prince&s;&s;es, and all their attendants were obliged to encamp in the neighbouring fields; and the Briti&s;h envoy, who was there at the time, wrote over to the mini&s;try, that five days after the earthquake, he went to Belem to pay his re&s;pects to them, but that the Queen &s;ent him word &s;he could not receive him, as &s;he was in a tent, and in no condition to be &s;een. Imagine what the mi&s;ery of the people mu&s;t have been, when even the royal family &s;uffered &s;o much.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we forget to mention the univer&s;al con|flagration that followed the earthquake. This mi&s;|fortune fell out at ten o'clock in the forenoon, that is, when all the kitchen fires were lighted again&s;t din|ner time, and all the churches illuminated in honour of the day. The fires in the kitchens, and the lights in the churches, rolled again&s;t the combu&s;tible mat|ters that were in their way, and the ruined town was pre&s;ently in flames. Li&s;bon is furni&s;hed with water by the means of aqueducts; but the aqueducts were broken by the concu&s;&s;ion, &s;o that little or no water was to be had. Yet had it been ever &s;o plentiful, the town would not have e&s;caped the conflagration, becau&s;e every one ran away to the fields, and other
<PB N="296" REF="300">
open &s;paces; and thus more lo&s;s was occa&s;ioned by the fire, than by the earthquake; as it con&s;umed every thing the people had in their hou&s;es, which might in a great mea&s;ure have been dug out of the ruins, if it had not been con&s;umed by the fire. What a &s;pectacle for &s;o many hundred thou&s;and peo|ple, to &s;ee all their hou&s;es in flames at once!</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h factory has a burying-ground in one of the &s;kirts of the city, planted with walks of cy|pre&s;s-trees, under which are the graves, "where, (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) I had the mortification to &s;ee many marble monuments with long, pompous, flattering in&s;criptions, erected to the memory of &s;ome of the merchants, their wives, and their children; whil&s;t the great author of Tom Jones is interred in this burying-ground, without even a &s;tone to indicate that 'Here lies <HI>Henry Fielding.</HI>"</P>
<P>The trade and navigation of this city are &s;o very con&s;iderable, that the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which lies on the Tagus, is the chief &s;ource of the King's European revenues. This is the grand magazine of all the goods which the Portugue&s;e bring from their foreign colonies. The harbour is very large, deep, &s;ecure, and convenient. It has two entrances, that on the north, called the <HI>corredor,</HI> lies between the &s;and-bank, the rock of Cachopos, and Fort <HI>St. Ju|lian.</HI> The &s;outhern entrance, which is much broader
<PB N="297" REF="301">
and more convenient, is between Cachopos and Fort <HI>S. Lawrence.</HI></P>
<P>The Tagus is navigable but a little way above Li&s;bon, occa&s;ioned by its running between inacce&s;|&s;ible rocks; and its current is broken by many rapid cataracts. A company of Dutchmen, in the reign of <HI>Charles II.</HI> offered to cut roads over the rocks, and to make dykes and &s;luices, which would facilitate the pa&s;&s;age of boats from Li&s;bon quite to Madrid, provided the revenue was given them, which amount|ed from taxes levied on goods thus to be conveyed by water.</P>
<P>Several councils were in con&s;equence held at Madrid and Li&s;bon; the conclu&s;ion of their delibe|rations was, 'If God had been willing to have this river navigable, he did not want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man to render it &s;o; becau&s;e he was able to pro|duce that great effect by a &s;ingle <HI>fiat.</HI> This as he had not done, it followed that he did not think proper to do it &s;o; that it would be contradicting his providence to endeavour to rectify what he ap|peared to have left imperfect, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf.'</P>
<P>Thus vani&s;hed this u&s;eful project, in con&s;equence of the philo&s;ophical determination of the&s;e coun|cils.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="302">A &s;imilar mode of rea&s;oning &s;eems to be adopted by the people of Minorca, who never prune a tree, the vine excepted, thinking it irreligious, in &s;ome degree, to pre&s;ume to direct its growth; and if any &s;tranger &s;hould expre&s;s his wonder that they for|bear this u&s;eful practice, and inform them of the advantages attending it in other countries, their an|&s;wer is&mdash;<HI>'God knows be&s;t how a tree &s;hould grow.'</HI></P>
<P>This city is walled round, having 77 towers on the walls, and 36 gates. In the centre of this ca|pital, on one of the mountains, &s;tands a citadel which commands the whole place, and has caverns in it, where four regiments of foot are con&s;tantly quartered. Clo&s;e by the &s;ea, at the di&s;tance of about 12 miles from the city, both the entrances to the harbour are defended by two forts. The river here is not above two miles over, though it widens by degrees towards Li&s;bon, where it is at lea&s;t ten miles broad. Between Li&s;bon and the&s;e forts &s;tands another fort, called Fort Belem, or Bellei&s;le, which commands the entrance into the city, and where all the &s;hips coming up the Tagus, mu&s;t give an ac|count of them&s;elves. The pro&s;pect at the entrance of the Tagus, from the &s;ea, cannot be exceeded. The buildings on the &s;hore, near Belem, which is the royal re&s;idence, appear, many of them, to be of noble con&s;truction; they are all white on the out&s;ide, with lattices and window-&s;hutters painted
<PB N="299" REF="303">
green, which have a fine effect from the river. Many of the hou&s;es have gardens and terraces, orna|mented with va&s;es, &s;tatues, turrets, and obeli&s;ks, and with &s;o many trees round them, that the <HI>coup d'aeil</HI> is rendered one of the grande&s;t and mo&s;t picture&s;que imaginable.</P>
<P>About 15 leagues to the north-we&s;t of the mouth of the harbour, are the Burlings, as they are called in the charts. They con&s;i&s;t of abundance of little rocky i&s;lands, a little di&s;tant from the &s;hore, three of them only &s;hewing them&s;elves above water.</P>
<P>Here the Portugue&s;e maintain a kind of garri&s;on, if we may allow it that name. It con&s;i&s;ts of male|factors, who are bani&s;hed hither for a term, for di|vers &s;mall offences. A policy which they may have copied from the Egyptians, as we may read in <HI>Diodorus Siculus.</HI> That wi&s;e people, to prevent the corruption of good manners by evil communication, built a town on the Red Sea, whither they tran&s;port|ed a great number of their criminals, having fir&s;t &s;et an indelible mark on them, to prevent their returning and mixing with the &s;ober part of the citizens.</P>
<P>At this place, called by <HI>Fielding,</HI> the ca&s;tle of Bellei&s;le, we were &s;aluted with a gun, which was a &s;ignal to pa&s;s no farther till we had complied
<PB N="300" REF="304">
with certain ceremonies, which the laws of this country require to be ob&s;erved by all &s;hips which arrive in this port. We were obliged then to ca&s;t anchor, and expect the arrival of the officers of the cu&s;toms, without who&s;e pa&s;sport no &s;hip mu&s;t proceed farther than this place.</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e we received a vi&s;it from one of tho&s;e magi&s;trates of health before-mentioned. He refu&s;ed to come on board the &s;hip, till every per&s;on in her had been drawn up on deck and per&s;onally viewed by him. "This occa&s;ioned &s;ome delay on my part (&s;ays <HI>Fielding</HI>) as it was not the work of a minute, to lift me from the cabin to the deck. The captain thought my particular ca&s;e might have been excu&s;ed from this ceremony, and that it would be abundantly &s;ufficient if the magi&s;trate, who was obliged afterwards to vi&s;it the cabin, &s;urveyed me there. But this did not &s;atisfy the magi&s;trate's &s;trict regard to his duty. When he was told of my lamene&s;s, he called out with a voice of authority &mdash;'Let him be brought up;' and his orders were pre&s;ently complied with. He was indeed a per&s;on of great dignity, as well as of mo&s;t exact fidelity in the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t. Both which are the more admirable, as his &s;alary is le&s;s than &pound;30 Engli&s;h <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>Before a &s;hip has been vi&s;ited by one of the&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="305">
magi&s;trates, no per&s;on can lawfully go on board her, nor can any one depart from her. This I &s;aw exemplified in a remarkable in&s;tance. A young lad, one of our pa&s;&s;engers, was here met by his fa|ther, who, on the fir&s;t news of the captain's arrival, came from Li&s;bon to Bellei&s;le in a boat, being ea|ger to embrace a &s;on whom he had not &s;een for many years. But when he came along-&s;ide our &s;hip, neither did the father dare a&s;cend, nor the &s;on de&s;cend, as the magi&s;trate of health had not yet been on board.</P>
<P>Some of my readers will perhaps admire the great caution of this policy, &s;o nicely calculated for the pre&s;ervation of this country from all pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers. Others will as probably regard it as too exact and formal to be con&s;tantly per&s;i&s;ted in, in &s;ea&s;ons of the utmo&s;t &s;afety, as well as in times of danger. I will not decide either way; but will content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that I never yet &s;aw or heard of a place where a traveller had &s;o much trouble given him at his landing as here. The only u&s;e of which, as all &s;uch matters begin and end in form only, is to put it into the power of low and mean fellows, to be either rudely officious or gro&s;sly corrupt, as they &s;hall &s;ee occa&s;ion to pre|fer the gratification of their pride or their ava|rice.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="306">Of this kind likewi&s;e is that power which is lodged with other officers here, of taking away every grain of &s;nuff, and every leaf of tobacco, brought from other countries, though only for the temporary u&s;e of the per&s;on during his re&s;idence here. This is executed with great in&s;olence; and, as it is in the hands of the dregs of the people, very &s;candalou&s;ly; for, under pretence of &s;earching for tobacco and &s;nuff, they are &s;ure to &s;teal whatever they can find; in&s;omuch that when they come on board, our &s;ailors addre&s;&s;ed us in the Covent Gar|den language, "Pray Gentlemen and Ladies take care of your &s;words and watches." Indeed I never &s;aw any thing equal to the contempt and hatred which our hone&s;t tars every moment expre&s;&s;ed for the&s;e Portugue&s;e officers.</P>
<P>At Bellei&s;le lies buried <HI>Catherine of Arragon,</HI> wi|dow of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> elde&s;t &s;on of our <HI>Henry VII.</HI> afterwards married to, and divorced from our <HI>Henry VIII.</HI> Clo&s;e by the church where her re|mains are depo&s;ited, is a large convent of Gerony|mites, one of the mo&s;t beautiful piles of building in all Portugal.</P>
<P>Having undergone the in&s;pection of the ma|gi&s;trate of health, I &s;ent my man to be&s;peak a good dinner, and then to bring a Li&s;bon chai&s;e with him to the &s;ea-&s;hore. At his return, after
<PB N="303" REF="307">
keeping me waiting full three hours on the deck, he told me, there was a new law lately made, that no pa&s;&s;enger &s;hould &s;et his foot on &s;hore without a &s;pecial order from the Providore; and that he him|&s;elf would have been &s;ent to pri&s;on for di&s;obeying it, had he not been protected as the &s;ervant of the captain. He informed me, likewi&s;e, that the captain had been very indu&s;trious to get this order, but that it was then the Providore's hour of &s;leep, a time when no man, except the King him&s;elf, dur&s;t di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>To avoid prolixity, though in a part of my nar|rative which may be more agreeable to my reader than it was to me, the Providore having at la&s;t fini&s;hed his nap, di&s;patched this ab&s;urd matter of form, and gave me leave to come, or rather be car|ried, on &s;hore.</P>
<P>What it was that fir&s;t gave the hint of this &s;trange law it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s. Po&s;&s;ibly in the infancy of their defection, and before their govern|ment could be formed, they were willing to guard again&s;t the bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;urprize; of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of which bare po&s;&s;ibility the Trojan hor&s;e will for ever remain on record, as a great and memo|rable example. Now the Portugue&s;e have no walls to &s;ecure them, and a ve&s;&s;el of two or 300 tons will contain a much larger body of troops
<PB N="304" REF="308">
than could be concealed in that famous machine, though <HI>Virgil</HI> tells us, &s;omewhat hyperbolically, that it was as big as a mountain.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e derive the origin of this city from <HI>Eli&s;a,</HI> a great grand&s;on of <HI>Noah,</HI> who is &s;aid to have been its fir&s;t founder, and that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was its re&s;torer. Though this is not very probable, yet it is certain the city was anciently called <HI>Uly&s;&s;aea,</HI> or <HI>Uly&s;&s;ipolis;</HI> and hence was changed in time to <HI>Oli&s;ipo.</HI> The Romans, as appears from &s;ome an|cient in&s;criptions, gave it the name of <HI>Felicitas Julia;</HI> but the Goths called it <HI>Oli&s;ipona,</HI> which the Moors altered to <HI>Oli&s;ibona;</HI> whence, in proce&s;s of time, was formed Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more di&s;gu&s;ting to a &s;tranger than the filth of the &s;treets in this metropolis of Portugal. In fact, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) the &s;treets are never cleaned, although there is an e&s;tabli&s;hed contract for &s;cavengers. This filth would be much more noi&s;ome than it actually is, were not every thing that can be eat up by &s;tarving dogs, quickly devoured by &s;warms of the&s;e animals, who live abroad and belong to no one. A fine northern breeze, which &s;prings up about noon, refre&s;hes the parched inhabitants of at lea&s;t all the higher parts of the city, and carries off the bane|ful effluvia, thrown even &s;ometimes, during the
<PB N="305" REF="309">
day, from the windows of the different hou&s;es; yet, after all, it is impo&s;&s;ible to walk the city without the olfactory nerves being continually &s;a|luted with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations: ac|cordingly no per&s;ons, who can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, ever walk the &s;treets, both on account of the vio|lent heat and the great di&s;tance, the city being &s;o exceedingly &s;pread in all directions; &s;o that it is a common ob&s;ervation of the natives, that, except per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t condition, no per&s;on is to be met with on foot, during &s;ome hours of the violent heat, but dogs and Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>Another &s;ingular circum&s;tance, very &s;triking to a &s;tranger rambling about this city, is the great number of negroes. Many of the&s;e unhappy wretches are natives of Africa, others born either in Portugal or in its ultramarine dominions. No &s;hips arrive from that quarter of the globe without &s;ome, and, when in Portugal, they are allowed to marry, not only among them&s;elves, but al&s;o with tho&s;e of a different colour. The&s;e cro&s;s-marriages (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) have filled the country with different breeds of human mon&s;ters. A black and a white produce a <HI>mulatto.</HI> Then a mulatto joins with a black or a white, and two other crea|tures are engendered, called <HI>me&s;tices.</HI> Then the white me&s;tices join with the black me&s;tices, or with two real blacks, whites or mulattos; and all
<PB N="306" REF="310">
branch out into &s;o many and various kinds, that it becomes very difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them by pecu|liar names, though they are ea&s;ily to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their peculiar hues.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a degree has the original race of the Portugue&s;e been depraved, that, to be a <HI>Blanco,</HI> that is, a perfect white, is become a title of ho|nour: &s;o that, when a Portugue&s;e &s;ays he is a <HI>Blanco,</HI> it is not to be under&s;tood that he is a white, but that he is a man of honour, a per&s;on of family and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e mongrel mixtures may be added the Jewi&s;h. Portugal abounds with Jews who per&s;on|ate Chri&s;tians, and often intermarry with the Por|tugue&s;e and Negroes. The&s;e &s;trange combinations have filled Li&s;bon with &s;uch a variety of uncouth faces, as to make the traveller doubt if he is really in Europe; and, in a few centuries, not a drop of Portugue&s;e blood will be left in the country, but the whole will be corrupted between Jews and Negroes.</P>
<P>To obviate one of the&s;e evils, both of which might ea&s;ily be removed by a &s;ecular tribunal, the Inqui&s;ition is always on the watch to find out the Jews; who, if di&s;covered, are certain to meet with no mercy from the holy fathers. Let a man
<PB N="307" REF="311">
but avow him&s;elf a Jew, and to be thrown in|to the flames will be his puni&s;hment. This in|ce&s;&s;ant diligence to detect the Jews makes them redouble their arts to conceal them&s;elves; and it is from this circum&s;tance that numbers of per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, and of all ages and &s;ituations in life, when they walk about the city, carry with them long ro&s;aries, and may be &s;een continually muttering <HI>Pater-no&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Ave Marias;</HI> that, if Jews, they may be thought Chri&s;tians; or, if Chri&s;tians, that they may not be looked upon as Jews.</P>
<P>To judge from the capital, the indu&s;try of this nation is not great; almo&s;t all the linen, woollen, and &s;ilk goods, to be met with in the different &s;hops, are of foreign importation, although they have in their own country, mo&s;t of the raw mate|rials. Their &s;teel, copper, and bra&s;s work is likewi&s;e imported from abroad, as are even their &s;hoes, except &s;uch as are made by foreigners. French tailors and hair-dre&s;&s;ers &s;warm in Li&s;bon, as they do in London. Statuaries, architects, and engravers, here never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any of the lea&s;t ce|lebrity. As for painters, they can boa&s;t of only one, <HI>Alonzo Sanches Coello,</HI> a di&s;ciple of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and a favourite of <HI>Philip II.</HI> who u&s;ed to call him <HI>Titian the Second.</HI> He is more known in Italy than Portugal.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="312">The di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation to the organs of the ear in this city, by the creaking of the cart-wheels is inexpre&s;&s;ible. They are here made out of two boards, nailed together, and clum&s;ily cut, in a circular form. Yet this painful noi&s;e might be obviated, if the carmen would grea&s;e the axletrees: to this they object, &s;aying the devil would then do mi&s;chief to their oxen, and that this noi&s;e frightens him away.</P>
<P>Among the charitable in&s;titutions worthy of being noticed are the Mi&s;ericordia and All Saints ho&s;pitals. The former has a magnificent church, and is under the direction of the principal nobility. The &s;tewards are cho&s;en annually; the expence of &s;erving that office, to tho&s;e who would acquire fame, amounts to 4 or 5000l. &s;terling a year. The funds of this ho&s;pital are applied to the relief of &s;uch per&s;ons as are reduced to indigence, and a&s;hamed to &s;olicit alms. They are likewi&s;e appro|priated to the portioning of young women, to the relief of pri&s;oners under confinement for debt, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in compounding with their creditors, that they may obtain their freedom. Prie&s;ts are al&s;o appointed by tho&s;e who have the direction of this charity, to attend and admini&s;ter con&s;olation to &s;uch criminals as are under &s;entence of death. In &s;hort, they &s;uccour and relieve all per&s;ons who
<PB N="309" REF="313">
not abandoned them&s;elves to vice, when labouring under &s;ickne&s;s or penury.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital of All Saints is one of the large&s;t and be&s;t endowed in Europe. Here they receive and admini&s;ter relief to per&s;ons of all nations and religions. The &s;ick, the lame, the lunatic, the foundling; all find an a&s;ylum in this ho&s;pital; and, when di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, have money given them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, till they are otherwi&s;e provided for.</P>
<P>The country about Li&s;bon is agreeably diver&s;ified with groves of orange and lemon trees, intermixed with olives and vineyards. The roads are bordered with aloes, which make an uncommon appearance to a native of a colder climate, when in flower; the &s;tem being then 12 or 14 feet high. The&s;e aloes blow every &s;ixth or &s;eventh year. What <HI>Brydone</HI> &s;ays of tho&s;e in Sicily is likewi&s;e ju&s;t in re&s;pect of the&s;e: 'As the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the plant is carried in|to the &s;tem and flowers, the leaves begin to decay as &s;oon as they have done blowing, and numerous young plants are produced round the roots of the old ones, which wither and die.'</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the roads in the environs are paved with large &s;tones. Near the city, in the valley of Alcan|tara, is &s;ituated the celebrated aqueduct, which joins two hills, and &s;upplies the city with water.
<PB N="310" REF="314">
This aqueduct runs tran&s;ver&s;ely over a valley a quar|ter of a mile in breadth. The &s;pace between the two center pillars is &s;o wide and lofty that a 50 gun &s;hip might pa&s;s through with all her &s;ails &s;pread. This building is an erection of the year 1748, and fortunately received little or no damage from the earthquake in 1755. The whole of this immen&s;e fabric is built of white marble.</P>
<P>The palace at Belem, about five miles from Li&s;|bon, where the court u&s;ually re&s;ide, is a very mean wooden edifice, (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) and has nothing wor|thy of remark, either on the out&s;ide or in the in&s;ide. There is not &s;o much as a &s;ingle picture from any of the Italian &s;chools in the whole king|dom of Portugal. What few pictures there were formerly in Li&s;bon, were de&s;troyed by the earth|quake. Nor are there any &s;tatues in Portugal, ex|cept two groupes in the royal gardens of this palace, expo&s;ed to the air very injudiciou&s;ly.&mdash; The&s;e groupes are of two figures each, as large as life, and of white marble. One is the daughter giving &s;uck to her father, and the other is a wo|man fainting and reclining in the arms of another woman. They are indeed perfectly beautiful, and in good pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Near the palace at Belem is a pillar erected, with an in&s;cription, importing that to be the &s;pot where
<PB N="311" REF="315">
the late Duke of <HI>Aveiro's</HI> palace &s;tood; he was exe|cuted for having <HI>&s;hot at the King,</HI> in 1759, and the palace was era&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal magnificent mona&s;teries in the environs of Li&s;bon, of which it may be proper to give &s;ome general account. The fir&s;t that we &s;hall notice is the royal convent at Mafoa. This pile of buildings contains 37 windows in front, and is near|ly a &s;quare of 728 feet. The church and the royal apartments take up one half of it, and the convent, the other. The whole of the chief front is as noble as art can make it. The gate in the middle has on each &s;ide an in&s;ulated column, of a kind of granite, little inferior to the Egyp|tian. Each column is cut out of a &s;ingle block, and is about three fathoms in circumference. But, what is mo&s;t &s;triking, is the a&s;cent to the church&punc; This is by a grand flight of &s;emicircular &s;tairs, which projects 152 feet into the &s;quare, before the building. Each corner of the chief front &s;upports a dome, in the form of a pavillion. The&s;e domes, viewed at a proper di&s;tance, have a fine effect, and contra&s;t &s;urprizingly well with the cupola and the four belfries belonging to the church. The roof of the apartments and the church, exclu&s;ive of the pa|villion, the cupola, and the belfries, is laid out in a kind of terrace, commanding an exten&s;ive pro|&s;pect. The belfries contain 160 bells, of various
<PB N="312" REF="316">
&s;izes, which, by the means of clock-work, ring a great number of curious chimes or carillons. The profu&s;ion of gold, &s;ilver, jewels, and precious marbles is incredible. There are &s;everal altars in this church, each as rich as money and workman&s;hip can make them. One altar alone is &s;aid to have co&s;t from 50, to 60,000l.</P>
<P>There are two large court-yards in this convent, &s;urrounded (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) by the fine&s;t porticos I ever &s;aw, even much &s;uperior to tho&s;e at Venice; and which &s;upport &s;everal apartments de&s;tined for the officers of &s;tate, when the court is there. The&s;e apartments, as well as tho&s;e of their Maje&s;ties, form a long range of rooms, communicating with that part of the building allotted to the friars. This con&s;i&s;ts of three dormitories, a refectory, an in|firmary, a kitchen, a library, &amp;c. One of the&s;e dormitories may be about 300 common paces in length, and wide enough for ten per&s;ons to walk abrea&s;t. The cells on each &s;ide are, in number, about 600; not low and narrow as in other con|vents, but &s;pacious and lofty, &s;o that they might each be termed a chamber fit for a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man prelate to inhabit. The friars are not &s;o numerous as the cells; there are of them only 300 be&s;ides 150 lay-brothers. The furniture of- each cell con&s;i&s;ts of a narrow, uncovered bed, a table, a few chairs, and a &s;helf for books. The lay-friars have no &s;helves,
<PB N="313" REF="317">
few of them being able to read. The refectory is a noble &s;ight. The table that runs through it admits of 150 people on each &s;ide; yet there is &s;ufficient &s;pace for another, at which the King &s;ometimes dines with his grandees.</P>
<P>As I entered the refectory, (adds <HI>Baretti</HI>) a little before dinner, the cloth was laid, and I could not help remarking that, between every two friars, there was a jug, containing about two bottles of wine. The&s;e jugs were all alike, of white earthen ware, with the King's arms engraved upon them. Clo&s;e to each mug was likewi&s;e placed a trencher of Brazil wood, with half a dozen figs, a couple of bunches of grapes, and two lemons. The re&s;t of the dinner con&s;i&s;ted of three good di&s;hes, <HI>gras</HI> or <HI>maigre,</HI> accord|ing to the day. To every friar a pound of bread is al&s;o allotted, with liberty to call for more. When the 300 <HI>padres</HI> are at dinner, the 150 lay-brothers wait behind them with the greate&s;t re&s;pect. It is the King who furni&s;hes them with this food, which makes them all look &s;o florid and &s;o jolly. Such faces (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) I never &s;aw in my life, not even in the pictures of <HI>Paul Verone&s;e,</HI> who delighted in painting hand&s;ome friars. The maintenance of this religious e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;aid to co&s;t the King about 25,000l. a year. The &s;malle&s;t part of the e&s;tabli&s;hment is the infirmary. But it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that tho&s;e friars who are become old or in|valids,
<PB N="314" REF="318">
valids, are &s;ent to &s;ome other convents, and young and healthy ones are &s;ub&s;tituted in their room.</P>
<P>Their library occupies a very large hall, be&s;ides another chamber of con&s;iderable dimen&s;ions. The hall contains about 70,000 volumes, and the cham|ber about 10,000. Among&s;t the&s;e latter are all the Portugue&s;e books that could po&s;&s;ibly be collected. There is &s;carce a family of any note in the kingdom who cannot boa&s;t of an hi&s;torian. Hence, it is &s;aid, ari&s;es, that noble elevation of mind, which makes the Portugue&s;e look with the greate&s;t di&s;|dain upon all other nations, and de&s;pi&s;e every thing that is not Portugue&s;e. In this chamber there are books of devotion, and lives of &s;aints, out of number. <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> alone, has above 100 vo|lumes on the&s;e &s;helves, each relating his exploits in a different manner. No <HI>Alexander,</HI> no <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> no <HI>King of Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> was ever honoured with &s;o much biography as <HI>S. Anthony.</HI></P>
<P>According to the opinion of the friars, the le&s;&s;er library is much more valuable than the other. In one re&s;pect they are right, as duplicates of books in the larger library are to be purcha&s;ed, but tho&s;e in the le&s;s, being books written in the Portugue&s;e language, are become very &s;carce &s;ince the earth|quake. However, the lo&s;s will not be very &s;everely felt, there being few writers in that language of
<PB N="315" REF="319">
any celebrity. The large library is a very good one. Be&s;ides a very capital collection of books in the ancient languages, it contains &s;ome valuable manu&s;cripts, in Hebrew and Arabic, and &s;ome of the friars are men of letters.</P>
<P>Here is a park of very con&s;iderable extent, but far from being embelli&s;hed by that verdure &s;o con|&s;picuous in our Engli&s;h ones, it having very much the appearance of a parched and rocky de&s;art, thinly &s;cattered with trees.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tone of this building was laid in 1717; and though above 6000 workmen were employed for more than 20 years, and a con&s;iderable number are &s;till occupied upon it, the building is not yet completed.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of its erection was owing to a vow made by the Archduche&s;s, who was married to <HI>John V.</HI> On approaching the coa&s;t of Portugal, the mountains of Mafra were the fir&s;t land &s;he &s;aw, and the fir&s;t favour &s;he &s;olicited of her royal con&s;ort was, that he would erect a convent on them to the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> and <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> to who&s;e joint protection &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf indebted for having landed &s;afe in Portugal.</P>
<P>About four leagues from Li&s;bon, is &s;ituated the
<PB N="316" REF="320">
convent of <HI>Odivelas,</HI> where it is &s;aid 300 beautiful nuns formed a &s;eraglio for the late monarch: each of them had one or more lovers, and were the mo&s;t attracting mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Portugue&s;e nobility. At pre&s;ent few of them are living, and tho&s;e that remain are grown old and ugly; &s;o that this place is no longer that &s;cene of debauchery it was formerly. A French writer, &s;peaking of this convent, &s;ays, that the fa|mous <HI>Portugue&s;e Letters,</HI> afterwards tran&s;lated into French, came from this tender, gallant, and volup|tuous mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>"I bought in this convent (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) &s;everal work-bags, made of the fibres of aloe-leaves. They co&s;t about a crown; and, when &s;oiled, are cleaned by being wa&s;hed in lemon-juice and water. Laces, gloves, reins for hor&s;es, &amp;c. are made of the &s;ame materials.</P>
<P>Near this mona&s;tery is another royal convent, in which are 130 monks, who are all noble, and have each a &s;ervant, which with the cooks and gardeners, amount to above 300 per&s;ons: &s;o that it is not to be wondered at, that it is as difficult to procure an egg or an onion for many miles round, as it would be if one travelled by land from Peter&s;burg to Pekin; for this great gulph &s;wallows up every thing. The revenue of this convent amounts to about 24,000l. a year. In the library are <HI>Ba&s;kerville's Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Foulis's
<PB N="317" REF="321">
Homer,</HI> both which were pre&s;ented to the &s;ociety by the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Rivers.</HI> The kitchen is very large, and the chimney &s;tands in the centre, the funnel of which is 34 feet long, 13 broad, and is &s;upported by eight iron pillars. Under this funnel are a great number of cauldrons of different kinds&punc; a &s;mall rivulet is made to run through the kitchen, in which are &s;even cooks con&s;tantly employed. The vaults under the convent are filled with various kinds of wines; and in their &s;tables are &s;everal hun|dred mules, for the&s;e worthy fathers to ride upon." "This convent, (adds <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) is the mo&s;t magnifi|cent and riche&s;t I have &s;een; and its inhabitants compo&s;e the mo&s;t agreeable body of eccle&s;ia&s;tics that are any where to be met with."</P>
<P>Oporto, the other city we propo&s;ed to treat of, and its &s;uburb, Villanova, are each built on a hill, with the Douro between them: a &s;ituation much re&s;embling Newca&s;tle-upon-Tyne, and its &s;uburb, Gate&s;head. There is no bridge over the Douro, becau&s;e, when the &s;now melts upon the mountains, this river overflows its banks, and lays the lower part of the city under water, &s;ometimes as much as 12 or 14 feet, running at the amazing rate of 16 miles an hour, and carrying all the ve&s;&s;els to &s;ea, many of which are lo&s;t on the &s;ands, or beat to pieces again&s;t the &s;hores.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="322">This city was originally called Portucale, or Por|to de Cale. It is about three miles di&s;tant from the mouth of the river Douro, which here forms a good harbour, though difficult of acce&s;s, from the rocks and &s;ands forming a bar, which can only be pa&s;&s;ed at high water. There is a fine quay, which runs along the banks of the river where the &s;hipping lie, &s;o that the merchants may &s;ee the ve&s;&s;els load and unload from their windows.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o an ar&s;enal, and dock-yards for building and equipping &s;hips of the line. Al|though the &s;ituation of this place is naturally &s;trong and inacce&s;&s;ible by &s;ea, yet for its defence, on the land-&s;ide, it has only &s;ome ruinous towers, and a &s;mall fort with four ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>"To walk about this city, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) is rather a violent exerci&s;e, not one &s;treet in it be|ing upon a level, except that where mo&s;t part of the Engli&s;h inhabit; all the others con&s;i&s;t of a&s;cents and de&s;cents, &s;ome of them &s;o very &s;teep as to make it difficult for any &s;ort of wheel-carriage to get along; for which rea&s;on litters, carried between a couple of &s;tout mules are a much &s;afer conveyance. The &s;treets are all paved with broad &s;tones, as are tho&s;e in Florence.</P>
<P>The boats on the river have an awning like the
<PB N="319" REF="323">
Venetian gondolas, and are rowed by men &s;tanding forward, after the &s;ame manner as they row at Venice, and &s;ometimes by one man with a &s;ingle oar.</P>
<P>The merchants a&s;&s;emble daily in the chief &s;treet to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s; and are protected from the &s;un by &s;ail cloths, hung acro&s;s them from the oppo|&s;ite hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This city, which for opulence, populou&s;ne&s;s, beauty and commerce, is the next in the kingdom to Li&s;bon, contains about 30,000 inhabitants. It has four &s;uburbs and &s;even pari&s;h churches, includ|ing the cathedral, one <HI>ca&s;a da Mi&s;ericordia,</HI> &s;ome ho&s;|pitals, and 12 convents, be&s;ides four others without the walls. The mo&s;t magnificent building is a convent of the <HI>Augu&s;tins,</HI> in which there is a beautiful gal|lery of very great extent: the church belonging to it, is of a circular form, and very richly ornamented. The church of <HI>S. Franci&s;co</HI> is full of wooden or|naments, profu&s;ely carved and entirely gilt, which has a very di&s;gu&s;ting effect. I ob&s;erved (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) many letters hanging by threads from the wall, di|rected to the mo&s;t glorious <HI>S. Francis.</HI> As they were all open, I took the liberty of reading &s;ome, and found they were only complimentary cards, and letters of thanks, for cures which the writers
<PB N="320" REF="324">
thought they had received by means of that Saint's intere&s;t with the <HI>Virgin Mary, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The chief article of commerce in this city, is wine. Twenty-thou&s;and pipes are annually ex|ported. The co&s;t is about 10 or 12 pounds each pipe. Eighty-thou&s;and are the u&s;ual annual pro|duce, &s;o that three-fourths are con&s;umed in the country. The merchants here have very &s;pacious wine-vaults, &s;ome of which are capable of hold|ing 6 or 7,000 pipes. The inhabitants of half the &s;hops in the city, are coopers, who &s;ell their ca&s;ks at about a moidore each. Thirty Engli&s;h families re|&s;ide here, who are chiefly concerned in this com|merce. The factory maintains the clergyman, who performs &s;ervice on Sundays at each hou&s;e alter|nately. They have al&s;o a burying ground in a field near the town. A Briti&s;h con&s;ul likewi&s;e re&s;ides here. It does not appear that the Engli&s;h mer|chants in this city, any more than tho&s;e at Li&s;bon and Cadiz, a&s;&s;ociate much with the people of the country. They are repre&s;ented by <HI>Co&s;tigan,</HI> to be a worthy, friendly, and ho&s;pitable &s;et of people; as attentive to their counting-rooms and bu&s;ine&s;s every day before dinner, as they are to dre&s;&s;ing, cards, and other amu&s;ements in the evening: many of them have been 20 or 30 years re&s;ident in Oporto, yet know but few words of the language; if they take a trip to any part of the adjacent country on a holiday,
<PB N="321" REF="325">
it is in parties of plea&s;ure with the ladies, to &s;ome &s;pot they have fixed upon, where they &s;end a good dinner before hand; there they dance, eat and drink heartily, without any communication with the in|habitants, who, by their manners and appearance, (adds the above writer) are no great objects of at|traction to the generality of Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>The two cities of Li&s;bon and Oporto may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the two eyes of Portugal, for here centre the whole riches of the country, and all their trade with foreign nations, and their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Bra&s;ils; upon which la&s;t e&s;pecially depends their whole exi&s;tence as a people, and the chief &s;upport of the throne. A &s;en&s;ible Portugue&s;e writer, who&s;e manu&s;cript performances are in the hands of his friends, but which he dares not offer for publica|tion, compares not unaptly, their whole kingdom, to one of that &s;ort of &s;piders which has a large body, containing all the &s;ub&s;tance (the capital) with very long, thin, feeble legs, reaching to a great di&s;tance, but which are of no &s;ort of u&s;e to it, and which it is hardly able to move.</P>
<P>Were any of us di&s;po&s;ed to e&s;timate our felicity according to the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of our living, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) in &s;peaking of this city, we have as much rea&s;on to congratulate our&s;elves on our arri|val here, as we have hitherto had to deem our&s;elves
<PB N="322" REF="326">
unfortunate in our journey through the country. Chri&s;tmas pies, fat turkeys, fine &s;urloins, jellies, and creams of all kinds, and every other delicacy, are to be met with in abundance. The foreign merchants, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, who are by far the mo&s;t numerous, not only live in afflu|ence them&s;elves, and much better than the &s;ame per&s;ons would do in London; but the na|tives follow their example, and live much in the &s;ame manner; they mix and communicate more with the foreigners here, than their countrymen do with tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed at Li&s;bon, where, as being the court, it was more natural to expect a di&s;po&s;ition to urbanity and mutual intercour&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>EMANUEL de Farca,</HI> a Portugue&s;e writer, in de|&s;cribing the character of his countrymen, &s;ays, 'the nobility think them&s;elves gods, and require a &s;ort of adoration; the gentry a&s;pire to equal them, and the common people di&s;dain to be thought infe|rior
<PB N="323" REF="327">
to either?' In their per&s;ons, the Portugue&s;e bear great re&s;emblance to the Spaniards, except that the latter are more robu&s;t, of a larger &s;ize, and make better &s;oldiers than tho&s;e of Portugal. As to the ladies, their complexions are in general of an olive ca&s;t; their features are delicate, and their vi&s;age thin. Their hair is black and &s;hining, and their eyes of uncommon lu&s;tre; nor are they deficient in vivacity. They have likewi&s;e the repute of being generous, charitable, and mode&s;t.</P>
<P>In another place, de&s;cribing their per&s;ons, (<HI>Baretti</HI> &s;ays) they are in general much fairer than one would expect in &s;o hot a latitude, from which it may be &s;een very clearly, they do not expo&s;e them&s;elves much to the &s;un. Almo&s;t all of them have open and ingenuous countenances. A good contra&s;t to their men, who&s;e &s;kins are rather &s;warthy, and who&s;e looks are rather &s;ullen and grave, even when they attempt to &s;mile, which they do very frequently. The &s;alutation of men to ladies, con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;hort and quick genuflexion. But this compliment the ladies &s;carcely return with a nod, e&s;pecially to their inferiors. The gentlemen embrace each other with great re&s;pect, and ki&s;s each other's left &s;houlder.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, (remarks <HI>Baretti</HI>) are of a di&s;po&s;i|tion much more amorous than the Engli&s;h. Love is the predominant pa&s;&s;ion on the Tagus, as liberty
<PB N="324" REF="328">
is on the Thames. But this generally happens to people of warm climates. In the northern regions, much cloathing as well as firing is nece&s;&s;ary to make life pa&s;s comfortably; and where cloathing and fir|ing are wanting, a con&s;iderable portion of time mu&s;t be employed in procuring them. This is the rea&s;on that in England there are multitudes of people who have never been in love, even once in their lives. In Portugal they are &s;laves to the god of love, almo&s;t from the hour of their birth, to that of their death: and <HI>Camoens</HI> very ju&s;tly &s;aid,
<Q>'Fair <HI>Venus</HI> cheri&s;hes the Portugue&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>In their devotion, the difference between them and the Engli&s;h is &s;triking. We &s;it or &s;tand with a compo&s;ed look, &s;ing our p&s;alms and anthems with an even tone, and &s;carce any one, not of the &s;ect of methodi&s;ts, who may be called the Lu&s;itanic part of of the Briti&s;h nation, betrays the lea&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m whatever. The Portugue&s;e, on the contrary, are devout to a degree of phrenzy. They are almo&s;t all the time upon their knees, they rai&s;e their eyes wi&s;t|fully towards Heaven, &s;ing loud, utter mo&s;t fervent ejaculations, and repeatedly beat their brea&s;ts with their hands. The re&s;pect they pay their friars is a&s;toni&s;hing. Men, women, and children will eagerly get up, run to them, and humbly ki&s;s their hands, their &s;leeves, the hem of their gar|ments, or the beads that hang from their wai&s;ts.
<PB N="325" REF="329">
When they die, they mu&s;t be buried in a habit, bought of &s;ome friar, whe&s;e &s;anctity was in great repute. As a proof of this, <HI>Baretti</HI> mentions an impudent Portugue&s;e friar he met with at Venice, who called all the Italians heretics, becau&s;e they would give him nothing for his old thread-bare cloak, which in Portugal he could have &s;old for 40 or 50 crowns.</P>
<P>But this devotion of the Portugue&s;e, does not in the lea&s;t interfere with their love of the other &s;ex, or their love of dancing, of which they are pa&s;&s;io|nately fond. Their dances are not of the cold, in|&s;ipid, Frenchified kind, but &s;uch as are calculated to fill the mind with de&s;ire, and the heart with joy.</P>
<P>Thus live the Portugue&s;e in an uninterrupted round of devotion and plea&s;ure. They are neither gluttons nor drunkards, although their country wants neither food nor drink. Their beef and veal are not &s;o good as in England, but their pork, mut|ton and lamb are excellent; and &s;o are their chick|ens, fowls, ducks, turkies, and game. As for fi&s;h, the Li&s;bon market is perhaps the mo&s;t plentifully and mo&s;t variou&s;ly &s;upplied of any in Europe, and all their fruit and garden-&s;tuff is &s;uperlatively good. How abundant mu&s;t be their fruit, may ea&s;ily be conceived, when <HI>Twi&s;s</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that from a &s;ingle orange-tree, in a garden belonging to one of the
<PB N="326" REF="330">
Engli&s;h merchants near Oporto, no le&s;s than 16,000 oranges had been gathered in one &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The poorer &s;ort of people &s;eldom are able to pro|cure fle&s;h, but the better kind keep good tables, and have French cooks. To keep a table, however, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) mu&s;t require a con&s;iderable income in Li&s;bon, if it co&s;ts proportionably in a family, to what it does in an inn. The table (he adds) at his <HI>auherge,</HI> which was far from being &s;umptuous, co&s;t him up|wards of a guinea each day.</P>
<P>Of the manners of living of people of fa&s;hion, he pretends to know but little. The inferior cla&s;&s;es &s;eem to like a good hou&s;e if they can get one. As to hou&s;ehold furniture, they have no very refined ideas. A hard mattra&s;s in a corner, or a mat, or their own cloaths, an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the be&s;t down beds; this makes them generally look dirty. Almo&s;t any thing will &s;upply the place of victuals; and water is excellent for quenching thir&s;t, e&s;pecially &s;uch good water as they have in Li&s;bon. In general they are healthy, full of &s;pirits, and live long, if we may judge of the great number of old people we &s;ee in their metropolis. <HI>Co&s;tigan,</HI> in his remarks on the lower cla&s;s of people among the Portugue&s;e, &s;ays that 'The benefits of foreign trade, and of the fine and exten&s;ive countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Portugal in Africa; the Ea&s;t, and South America have never yet reached the
<PB N="327" REF="331">
Portugue&s;e pea&s;ant, any farther than by enabling the in|habitants of the two capitals, Oporto and Li&s;bon, to pay &s;ome little advance on the provi&s;ions he brings to market. The only foreign luxury he is yet acquant|ed with, is tobacco; and when his feeble pul&s;e can reach it, he purcha&s;es a dried Newfoundland cod-fi&s;h; a regale, however, he can &s;eldom a&s;pire to. A piece of bread, made of Indian corn, and a &s;alted pilchard, or a head of garlic to give that bread a flavour, compo&s;e his &s;tanding di&s;h, and if he can get a bit of the hog, the ox, or the calf he him&s;elf fattens, to fea&s;t his wretched family at Chri&s;tmas or Ea&s;ter, he has reached the pinnacle of happine&s;s in this world; and indeed, whatever he were to po&s;|&s;e&s;s beyond this habitual penury, would quickly be taken from him; or rather he would willingly part with it to &s;ome of the numerous gho&s;tly comforters, with which his country &s;warms, in order to attain happine&s;s in another &s;tate of exi&s;tence, under their guidance and direction. This he is made to believe is only to be procured by faithfully paying his tithes, by charitable donations to &s;uch a convent, or to the &s;hrine and officiating prie&s;ts of any altar that happens more particularly to be the object of his adoration. If any misfortune has befallen him, he fancies he has been deficient in &s;omething e&s;&s;ential; his zeal and donations are therefore redoubled. Should he have been &s;ucce&s;sful, the &s;ame effects are produced through effu&s;ions of gratitude. If he has
<PB N="328" REF="332">
money to procure admi&s;&s;ion into a convent for his &s;on or his daughter, this rai&s;es the credit of his family for ever; and nothing is wanting to give him a kind of apotheo&s;is in all the convents and country round, but to bequeath at his death what little money he can mu&s;ter, to be divided among the prie&s;ts, that they may procure a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age for his &s;oul; through the ordeal fire of purgatory, to the enjoyment of tho&s;e finely painted &s;cenes, which, like a di&s;tant gau|dy picture, have been long held out to his fond ima|gination.'</P>
<P>Such (according to the above writer) is the &s;tate of the Portugue&s;e pea&s;antry. We &s;u&s;pect, however, the picture to be too highly coloured; at lea&s;t that part which regards the artifices of the prie&s;ts, and that the real cau&s;e of their poverty and wretchedne&s;s, is the want of internal commerce and manufactures. Whether catholics or prote&s;tants, of whatever &s;ort or denomination, the lower order of prie&s;ts in every country, find &s;ome &s;pecious pretexts for picking the pockets of that cla&s;s of people he is de&s;cribing; but the quantum they obtain from each individual, is &s;eldom of much moment, when compared with their relative income.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men among the common people, is a large cloak and &s;louched hat; under the cloak they commonly wear a dagger, though that treach|erous

Wine is &s;el|dom wanted, but when a&s;ked for, is brought in &s;mall quantities from the adjoining tavern; but they drink abundance of fine cold water, and at night the &s;malle&s;t bit of cold meat, or a pilchard, with plenty of excellent lettuce or other &s;allad, tempered with oil and vinegar, which make almo&s;t the univer&s;al &s;auce for every thing, and good bread, &s;erve for &s;up|per.

The epicurians and refiners in the plea&s;ure of eating, drink the water &s;lowly, in order to pro|tract the delightful &s;en&s;ation that cold water rai&s;es in the palate, when mixed with the &s;weetmeat it has ju&s;t before been &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with, and which the Portugue&s;e a&s;&s;ert, very far exceeds the re|li&s;h of the fine&s;t wine that can be drank.

The Governor's lady was the only woman at table, and had more the appearance of his grand-daughter, than his wife; &s;he was wrapped up in her long baize cloak, but her hair was done up prettily with flowers and topaz combs, and a few diamond &s;prigs, without any cap. The Governor was al&s;o in his cloak. He took his place at the lady's right-hand, and the re&s;t of the company, which was numerous, &s;eated them&s;elves according to their ranks; the Carving knight, a po&s;t of honour, &s;till exi&s;ting at court, and in &s;ome families in Portugal, at the lower end of the table, &s;erved the company round, who were &s;tiff and ceremonious; neither was the aid of the chearing gla&s;s called in, to exhilarate the gue&s;ts, but it &s;eemed as if the water, of which they took great draughts, produced the &s;ame effect. One of the principal gue&s;ts in particular, &s;willed down a
<PB N="335" REF="340">
three-pint tumbler full of the cry&s;tal liquor at a draught. At la&s;t the Governor called for a wine-gla&s;s, into which was poured a thimble-full of that liquor. One of the gue&s;ts, however, a prie&s;t, who &s;eemed to be a wag, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) called for wine repeatedly, on which the lady began to rally him, and told him he drank like a <HI>Mauregato,</HI> or an Engli&s;hman; here the Governor calling for another gla&s;s of wine, drank to the King of England's health, putting the gla&s;s to his lips, but did not ta&s;te the liquor either time. The <HI>Maurigatos</HI> are a fraternity of carriers of goods through many of the interior provinces of Spain; they are the <HI>Har|rieros Yangue&s;es</HI> of <HI>Don Quixotte,</HI> and remarkable for their fidelity with regard to any tru&s;t committed to their care, and for never admitting per&s;ons of equivocal character into their &s;ociety. As &s;oon as the dinner was over, a folding door opened that was behind the lady, and the company pa&s;&s;ed into the next apartment, where the de&s;&s;ert, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;weetmeats and fruits, was &s;et out on a much &s;maller table; the company took their &s;eats, and were not crouded; for above half of them had di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked why &s;o great a part of the company, who were officers, retired immediately after dinner, and did not come in to the de&s;&s;ert? To an&s;wer that que&s;tion it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="336" REF="341">
there are numbers of books in Portugal, containing regulations for the di&s;ciplining, cloathing, and eco|nomy of the troops; but there is one, above all others, written many years ago, intitled <HI>The Per|fect Portugue&s;e Captain,</HI> which book is &s;till held in high e&s;teem by the nobility and principal per&s;ons of the army, as well as by the different orders of monks and friars; it contains indeed little or no|thing concerning the military duty of an officer, but, on the other hand, it is quite the mirror of po|litene&s;s and decorum. It teaches the officer how many plaits he is to have in his &s;hirt, and how many curls in his wig; the exact breadth of the lace on his coat; how he is to bow and kneel, when he comes into a room, as they did to the lady of the Go|vernor: it explains to the officer, after the mo&s;t diffu&s;e and edifying manner, all his duty as a Ca|tholic chri&s;tian; the nature of all the &s;acraments, and how he is to receive them; compares his kneel|ing at the altar, to eat the Deity, to the honour of &s;itting down at table to dine with his general; and it is particularly careful in directing the &s;ubaltern and captain how they are to behave in the &s;olemn act; tells them, they are to keep their eyes mode&s;t|ly fixed on the plate or di&s;h immediately before them; that they are to tuck one end of the napkin under their chin, and to place the other under the plate they eat off; that they are to hold the &s;poon or knife in the right hand, and the fork in the left;

with many other directions of equal importance; as &s;oon as dinner is over, and the de&s;&s;ert &s;erved, and before the general &s;hall eat his &s;weetmeat, every &s;ubaltern who &s;hall happen to be at table, mu&s;t ri&s;e up and retire; and this was the true rea&s;on why &s;o many officers did not come into the de&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>This humiliating di&s;tinction towards &s;ubalterns, has its ri&s;e from their commi&s;&s;ion never being &s;igned by the King, till the reform under Count <HI>de Lippe,</HI> in 1763, and from their having been taken, as they &s;till continue to be, for the mo&s;t part, from the menial &s;ervants of the nobility.</P>
<P>To give &s;ome further in&s;ight into the characters and manners of people of fa&s;hion in Portugal, we &s;hall relate a &s;ub&s;equent vi&s;it to the epi&s;copal palace at Elva, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) where we were u&s;hered into a large &s;aloon, tolerably well furni&s;hed, and hung with crim&s;on dama&s;k, in which were &s;ome part of the com|pany not already a&s;&s;embled. This bi&s;hop boa&s;ted that he &s;prung from a noble family, of Engli&s;h ex|traction; but, as to his per&s;onal character, he was one of the mo&s;t intriguing, mi&s;chievous eccle&s;ia&s;tics any where to be met with; and, though his deli|cacy pretended to be &s;candalized at a per&s;on of the fair &s;ex coming to vi&s;it him from Li&s;bon; yet he kept a couple of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in the hou&s;e with him, under the denomination of nieces, to whom we were then going to be introduced. After &s;ome
<PB N="338" REF="343">
time the Bi&s;hop made his appearance, preceded by three eccle&s;ia&s;tics and his two nieces: the company paid their re&s;pects, and we were pre&s;ented, and re|ceived with great cordiality; &s;alvers of dry &s;weet|meats, and gla&s;&s;es of water were then offered to the company, after which &s;ome bad tea and coffee were handed about; the&s;e being removed, the card-tables were placed. It fell to the lot of my friend who accompanied me, an Engli&s;h nobleman, to be part|ner with one of the nieces, again&s;t the governor, who had ju&s;t then come in, and the bi&s;hop. During the cour&s;e of play he felt &s;ome gentle &s;queezes on his toe, to which at la&s;t he thought it time to corre&s;pond, but would not venture to make the &s;malle&s;t motion till he could a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf they proceeded from the lady, and not perhaps acci|dentally from one of the two gentlemen on his right or left; by ca&s;ting his eyes unperceived under the table, when the &s;econd rubber was about to begin, he &s;aw the lady's feet very well &s;tretched out towards his own, and had no more doubt of the part he was to act; and the play then went on both under the table and over it. My opponents, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) were an officer and a judge, dre&s;&s;ed in his gown, with a large cro&s;s at his brea&s;t. Much of our time was &s;pent in their abu&s;ing each other's play; and, during their altercation, I ob&s;erved they gave each other the lie direct, repeatedly, without the lea&s;t appearance of offence on either
<PB N="339" REF="344">
&s;ide, or any emotion of &s;urprize among the &s;pec|tators, who were numerous. Upon mentioning to an old French general in their &s;ervice, the dumb intrigue carried on by my friend, under the table at the bi&s;hop's, and a&s;king, if all the women of quality in the country were of &s;uch facility of addre&s;s in matters of gallantry, he laughed at the recital, but told us, that gallantry, in Portugal, required great &s;kill, patience and addre&s;s. It was dangerous, but by no means on the part of the ladies, who, of them&s;elves, were the be&s;t and kinde&s;t creatures ima|ginable, but on account of the jealous eyes of male and female Argu&s;es; for the mothers well know this to be the be&s;t &s;ecurity they could have for their daugh|ters' virtue. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, when the merci|le&s;s &s;word was once un&s;heathed, it &s;eldom returned to the &s;cabbard without doing mi&s;chief. Intrigue here, he ob&s;erved, was as different from the &s;ame thing in Paris or London, as the two greate&s;t oppo&s;ites in nature, and mu&s;t be as differently managed."</P>
<P>The family of a Portugue&s;e, like that of a Spani&s;h nobleman, always contains a &s;warm of u&s;ele&s;s clients and dependants. When a per&s;on is once attached to a Portugue&s;e family, it is con&s;idered, as a kind of obligation, to feed and &s;upport them, from father to &s;on, or by his intere&s;t to provide them &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;hments in the world, and to marry off their
<PB N="340" REF="345">
daughters to the be&s;t advantage. This number of male and female attendants, collected under one roof, in the great families, occa&s;ions the whole to be one continued &s;cene of private gallantry and intrigue. The general rendezvous is every morning in the cha|pel, where there are daily four or five ma&s;&s;es cele|brated by the family chaplains; the language and intercour&s;e of the lovers is unintelligible to all but the parties immediately concerned; it is a to&s;s of the head; an eye ca&s;t up or thrown down, to the right or left; the fixing of a bouquet, or the pin|ning of a flower or a ribband of &s;uch a colour to &s;uch a part of the head or brea&s;t; nay, the very throw of the long cloak over the &s;houlders; and the particular manner of doing &s;o, will convey the hie|roglyphic of their wi&s;hes, their intentions, and a&s;|&s;ignations. Indeed it could hardly be otherwi&s;e where a number of idle and healthy young men and women are a&s;&s;embled under the &s;ame roof, without any other moral or religious principle of re&s;traint, but the fear of being di&s;covered; and, &s;timu|lated the more by the difficulties oppo&s;ed to the gratification of their de&s;ires, they will quickly counterfeit the appearance of every virtue to accom|pli&s;h their ends.</P>
<P>The following anecdote, from <HI>Co&s;tigan,</HI> related by a French officer in the &s;ervice of Portugal, Ma|jor General <HI>de Valer&eacute;,</HI> may &s;erve as a confirmation
<PB N="341" REF="346">
of the underhand intrigues in the families of the Portugue&s;e nobility. This officer, although a fa|vourite with Mar&s;hal <HI>de Saxe,</HI> had been obliged, by a variety of adventures, in the early part of his life, to offer his &s;ervices to in&s;pect the education of the &s;on and heir of a Portugue&s;e nobleman of high rank, with a view to make his way either in the army or to &s;ome civil employment. "But I &s;oon found, (&s;aid the general) that my only channel was by marrying one of the favourite maids of her excellency, the mother of my pupil, and that then I &s;hould be quickly provided for; as for teach|ing the &s;on any thing, that was entirely out of the que&s;tion; his mother would never permit him to apply, and his whole time, in the morning, was &s;pent in conver&s;ing or playing at cards with the lacquies in the &s;tables; and, in the afternoon, he dre&s;&s;ed in his uniform, rode about the city, went to the bull-fea&s;ts, or did whatever he liked be&s;t. I was perfectly idle, and wi&s;hed, by almo&s;t any means, for a commi&s;&s;ion in the army. I had &s;craped a par|ticular acquaintance with one of the grave&s;t of the lady's attendants, called the <HI>Dya,</HI> or &s;ub-governe&s;s, a very hand&s;ome woman, and &s;till in her prime; &s;he &s;mattered a little French, and, under pretence of improving it, I was frequently admitted to her conver&s;ation. We &s;oon came into the practice of the family, and commenced a piece of gallantry, which was carried as far as either &s;he or I could de&s;ire.
<PB N="342" REF="347">
She told me, after we were become very intimate, that &s;he had a very great regard and friend&s;hip for me, and that if I would agree to marry her daugh|ter, a very fine young girl, and al&s;o an attendant in the family, &s;he would undertake to get me a cap|tain's commi&s;&s;ion. I had already &s;een her daugh|ter, and, except the circum&s;tance of her being &s;o, had no objection; and this I propo&s;ed to her, when &s;he next talked on the &s;ubject; &s;he an&s;wered me by &s;aying, &s;he did not apprehend I was inclined to be &s;o &s;queami&s;h; that I was one who was di&s;|po&s;ed to drown my&s;elf in very little water, and that, &s;urely, if <HI>&s;he</HI> had no objection, <HI>I</HI> ought to have none, to become as intimate with her daugh|ter, as I had been with her&s;elf; that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for her daughter's knowing any thing of our connexion, which might be carried on in the &s;ame manner after marriage as before, without cau&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion. I temporized with this wo|man, and begged time to advi&s;e with my relations; in this &s;he acquie&s;ced, provided I continued to be her gallant; and, during this time, the effects of another piece of gallantry, between her daughter and my friend the &s;ecretary, became too vi&s;ible to be any longer concealed, which got me out of the &s;crape. Such another propo&s;al being afterwards made me, by the mother of my young pupil, in favour of another young per&s;on of her attendants, I
<PB N="343" REF="348">
married her, and got my&s;elf out of this ba&s;e dome&s;|tic &s;ort of life.</P>
<P>Another &s;ingular cu&s;tom in the great families of Portugal is the putting &s;ervants almo&s;t on a level with the heads of the family. The Portugue&s;e no|bility and gentry are &s;hocked at the improper and &s;evere di&s;tance at which the Engli&s;h keep their &s;ervants, treating them more like &s;laves than hum|ble friends and attendants; whereas they think, that by gentle and familiar treatment, they bid fairer for conciliating their affections, and en&s;uring their fidelity. A glaring in&s;tance of this &s;ort (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) I was eye-witne&s;s to, at a grand enter|tainment, given by a Portugue&s;e nobleman. After tea, coffee, and &s;weetmeats had been &s;erved in abundance to a very large company, a con&s;iderable part of it &s;tood up to dance country-dances, while others retired to other apartments, where card-ta|bles were placed; and, at a large one, the elde&s;t &s;on of the family held a faro-bank, which &s;oon drew to it people enough, willing to try their fortunes, among whom I was one. We continued playing for &s;ome time, when, looking round, to my &s;urprize I &s;aw three or four of the dome&s;tics, who had &s;erved us the tea and coffee, &s;eated familiarly among us, punting at the bank, and conver&s;ing with the banker and gentlemen upon the mo&s;t equal footing, and treated by them with the utmo&s;t civility and complai&s;ance,
<PB N="344" REF="349">
calling them by their chri&s;tian names, always pre|ceded by <HI>Senhor,</HI> or Mr. in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e nobility is divided into three cla&s;&s;es. When the <HI>ecuyer,</HI> on hor&s;eback, rides be|fore the carriage, the Li&s;bon etiquette denotes it to belong to the firk rank; the <HI>ecuyer</HI> riding on one &s;ide marks the &s;econd rank; and, when he rides be|hind, he belongs to the third cla&s;s of nobility. It is al&s;o cu&s;tomary for gentlemen to &s;it uncovered in their carriages; but a &s;ervant, returning in one, is obliged to &s;it covered, by which means the per|&s;ons &s;itting in other carriages, which meet or pa&s;s it, are betrayed into no improper &s;alutations.</P>
<P>A drunkard is held in contempt and dete&s;tation in Portugal, and the very appellation of drunkard, &s;eriou&s;ly applied, is reckoned equal to the bittere&s;t term of reproach that can be be&s;towed in the Engli&s;h language: on the contrary, nothing is more common, among friends and acquaintances, in con|ver&s;ation, than to give and receive the lie recipro|cally, in &s;erious as well as jocular di&s;cour&s;e, without any offence being taken. Such are the oppo&s;ite cu&s;toms of different nations, even in our limited continent of Europe. To this we &s;hall &s;ubjoin an anecdote, &s;omewhat to the purpo&s;e, which happened during the war in 1762. Major <HI>Luttrell,</HI> of gene|ral <HI>Burgoyne</HI>'s light dragoons, which were then
<PB N="345" REF="350">
&s;erving in Portugal, &s;eeing &s;ome fine Spani&s;h hor&s;es in the troop of an officer in the Portugue&s;e &s;ervice, who was then rai&s;ing a regiment, took a fancy to one of them, and was de&s;irous of purcha&s;ing it. They accordingly made a bargain before witne&s;&s;es, and it was agreed he &s;hould have the hor&s;e the &s;ame evening, for 60 moidores: Before evening came the captain changed his mind, and &s;ent the major word he could not let him have the hor&s;e, unle&s;s he advanced con&s;iderably beyond the price. Major <HI>Luttrell,</HI> provoked at &s;uch a breach of promi&s;e, went with his interpreter to the captain, telling him be|forehand, that, though he could not &s;peak the lan|guage of the country, yet he under&s;tood it well enough to know if he interpreted faithfully what he &s;hould tell him in Engli&s;h, and &s;wearing, if he did not, that he would in&s;tantly run him through the body. When they came to the captain, major <HI>Luttrell</HI> a&s;ked him if he had not agreed, in the fore|noon, to &s;ell him &s;uch a hor&s;e at &s;uch a price? To which the other readily an&s;wered in the affirmative. He then a&s;ked him why he now receded from his bargain? The captain an&s;wered, He receded from it becau&s;e the hor&s;e was too cheap; and, that he would not part with him unle&s;s he gave him 80, in&s;tead of 60 moidores. Major <HI>Luttrell</HI> now order|ed his interpreter to tell the captain that, by his infamous behaviour, he had &s;hewn him&s;elf to be a liar, a ra&s;cal, and a &s;coundrel. The captain, at
<PB N="346" REF="351">
this, &s;hrugged his &s;houlders, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry the gentleman &s;hould take offence, where none was intended; but that he would part with his hor&s;e on no other terms. On finding this, the major de|&s;ired the interpreter to acquaint the captain, that in France or England, if one officer be&s;towed on ano|ther &s;uch epithets as he had done on him, the officer &s;o gro&s;sly in&s;ulted, mu&s;t, and certainly would, di|rectly call the other out, and fight him.</P>
<P>The captain, &s;till pre&s;erving his <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> replied to the interpreter very deliberately, that what the gentleman &s;aid might be very true, for any thing he knew to the contrary, but that he &s;aw no good rea|&s;on for preferring the practice of foreigners, in this in&s;tance, to that of his own country; if he con|&s;idered him&s;elf &s;o affronted, he &s;hould never be &s;uch a fool or a madman as, by calling out his antagoni&s;t, to offer him an equal chance of taking his life, while he knew of a &s;afer and more certain method of obtaining &s;atisfaction, adequate to the affront re|ceived. In other words, by &s;tabbing him una|wares, or by hiring a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to do &s;o. Such is the point of honour in this country.</P>
<P>Beggars in Portugal are very numerous. "It is impo&s;&s;ible, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) to conceive how I was teized by them. There are always &s;ome come about you with a &s;impering look. They hope you have had

'Well, here is &s;omething for the little babe.' 'But pray, good Sir, give me &s;omething for my dear mother; for my younger &s;i&s;ter; for my cou&s;in; for my niece.' There is no end of their languid coquetry, e&s;pecially if the wenches be &s;omewhat young and &s;prightly. At Peagones one of them came in whil&s;t I was at dinner, and fir&s;t a&s;ked as u&s;ual for &s;ome pin-money;&punc; then for a loaf of bread; then for a bit of the pa&s;try; then for a wing of a fowl; then for a &s;lice of chee&s;e; and then for a bunch of grapes.

In &s;having me, I was told many things by him, of which he &s;up|po&s;ed me ignorant; as, that in Portugal the wea|ther was very hot; that there were figs and grapes in abundance; and likewi&s;e plenty of fi&s;h, the &s;ea being &s;o very near.

The chance that the Portugue&s;e have to conquer Spain is next to impo&s;&s;ible; and people will always hate tho&s;e whom they mu&s;t &s;ometimes fight again&s;t, without any hopes of getting the better of them.

One wore horns on his head, and another had a tail hanging behind him. One had tied his cloak round his wai&s;t petticoat-wi&s;e, and another had &s;tockings of different colours. Some wore the <HI>Golilla</HI> after the Spani&s;h manner, and others large breeches, after the Swi&s;s mode. Some &s;hook the ca&s;tanets, others played on the guitar.

Several &s;tooped down in a row that others might jump over them; and &s;everal ran round the &s;quare throwing their hands and legs about like madmen. Two of them came under the window of the inn, and rai&s;ed up their long &s;ticks, on which they had fa&s;tened wooden parrots, ill &s;haped and ill painted, then, laughing mo&s;t immode|rately, cried out, <HI>Montu, montu.</HI> Many &s;hewed their humour, by pulling off their hats to me, and bowing to the ground, with a mock re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>This buffoonery, or low wit, is extended to their poetry, they are mo&s;t unmerciful poet-ta&s;ters, and make ver&s;es on every occa&s;ion, the mo&s;t trifling, as well as the mo&s;t important; and all in the &s;ame bad &s;tyle, all equally bomba&s;tic, extravagant, and gigan|tic. But on occa&s;ion of a marriage, or the anni|ver&s;ary of a birth-day, the complimentary ver&s;es are held indi&s;pen&s;able; above all the glozers are what may be deemed the mo&s;t ludicrous and extraordi|nary.

<P>It is u&s;ual for the Portugue&s;e nobility, to give en|tertainments of this kind at their villas in the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="352" REF="357">
of the capital. A de&s;cription of the &s;plen|dour with which they are accompanied, may not be unentertaining, as their magnificence exceeds any thing to be &s;een in this country. The one we are going to relate, was given by the Marquis <HI>de Pancor|va,</HI> on the marriage of his daughter. Such quan|tities of ancient plate, chairs, tables, uten&s;ils, and &s;uch numbers of &s;ervants, borrowed and collected from all his friends and acquaintances, at &s;uch an ex|orbitant expence, for one moment, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) from whom the account is taken, are only to be ex|emplified in the family of a Portugue&s;e nobleman. The card of invitation we received on the occa|&s;ion, was to dine with him at his country-hou&s;e, on the other &s;ide of the Tagus, and reque&s;ted us to be at the water-&s;ide at 11 o'clock next forenoon, where there would be a barge in waiting to receive us; and tho' we were punctual, we found every thing there ready, and the family embarked, and a dozen other barges full of nobility, with &s;treamers and colours flying, &s;carlet or crim&s;on awnings, &s;urrounded with gold fringes and &s;ilk curtains. The rowers of each barge were dre&s;&s;ed in different uniforms. One barge was rowed by 20 oars, and three men to each, ri&s;ing up and &s;itting down at every &s;troke; the whole &s;etting off in cadence on a &s;ignal given, each having a band of mu&s;ic on board. A &s;cene which reminded us of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> going to meet <HI>Anthony.</HI> We had three leagues to go, and our rowers, &s;tout men from the
<PB N="353" REF="358">
province, exerted all their &s;trength; but the tide being far from favourable, it was two o'clock before we arrived at the &s;cene of action. A very large villa &s;tood upon the beach, &s;urrounded by dwarf|firs, and &s;and-hills. Dinner was already &s;erved in the &s;econd &s;aloon, into which we were u&s;hered. The table con&s;i&s;ted of 50 covers, with a couple of &s;ervants behind each chair. The ladies were much fewer in number than the gentlemen. The enter|tainment con&s;i&s;ted of three regular &s;ervices, and the whole in old heavy ma&s;&s;ive plate. Many of the &s;er|vants were in uniform, others perfectly well dre&s;&s;ed, with fine lace ruffles, and the collar and cro&s;s of the order of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hanging on their brea&s;ts. Dur|ing dinner, &s;everal pieces of <HI>Perez's</HI> mu&s;ic were played, and there were &s;ome charming <HI>arias</HI> by the be&s;t voices from the patriarchal church. The &s;ame mu&s;ic continued at the de&s;&s;ert, in the adjoining &s;a|loon to which we removed: one half of the &s;ervants attending us thither, whil&s;t the other and graver part &s;at down to dinner at the table we left.</P>
<P>The windows of the apartment where the de&s;&s;ert was &s;erved, were numerous, &s;pacious, and open to the bottom, &s;o that the floor was on a level with the ground without, on which there now appeared a company of ma&s;ks, dre&s;&s;ed as &s;hepherds and &s;hep|herde&s;&s;es, with flowers and garlands, and dancing in a variety of figures to the mu&s;ic, which accompanied
<PB N="354" REF="359">
them. When they cea&s;ed, two men, and as many women, danced the Spani&s;h Fandango, in the mid&s;t of which, and to the time of the mu&s;ic, one of the men contrived to give a wheel into the &s;aloon, and placed a crown of myrtles, beautifully interwoven with flowers, and two billing-doves &s;u&s;pended over it on the head of the bride, while one of the women did the &s;ame on the bridegroom; this feat, which in reality, is a very nimble performance, drew a hundred <HI>viva's</HI> from the company; the poets be|came more and more vociferous with their <HI>motes</HI> and their <HI>glozas,</HI> and the whole company &s;eemed di&s;|&s;olved in joy and &s;atisfaction. At la&s;t about &s;un-&s;et, coffee appeared, and in an hour after, the whole company were embarked in their barges for Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The drollery and facetiou&s;ne&s;s of the watermen, who were in dire wrath with their &s;aint for not giv|ing them a wind, was now a new &s;ubject for mirth. The barges had &s;eparated to the right and left in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;pacious ba&s;on to Li&s;bon, the better to enjoy the effects of the mu&s;ic. Our barge had taken the right of all, and the tide coming full in, as we ap|proached the city, where the current is extremely rapid, we were carried a con&s;iderable way above it, our &s;tout Algarve rowers pulling &s;trong again&s;t the tide to very little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="360">"I wi&s;h <HI>S. Anthony</HI> would &s;end us a breeze from tho&s;e hills to the north, (&s;aid one of the rowers) as he often does.

The <HI>re&s;pon&s;io</HI> is a &s;ort of prayer in bad Latin, which the prie&s;ts teach the people to addre&s;s to <HI>S.

<P>"Hand my go&s;&s;ip from the prow," &s;aid a faceti|ous fellow near me, "and I will talk to him." This man, named <HI>Ivo,</HI> was the e&s;tabli&s;hed wit and oracle of the whole crew. Upon this, they handed him a board about two feet long, and five or &s;ix inches broad; at the lower end was fixed a &s;mall box for re|ceiving alms, and about it was painted the figure of the &s;aint, with the child <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in his arms. <HI>Ivo</HI> &s;at the &s;aint down before them, the rowers tugged away, and we offered them wine, which they refu&s;ed, but drank plenty of water which they had brought with them in their kegs. <HI>Ivo</HI> then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> 'You know go&s;&s;ip,' &s;aid he, 'for <HI>S.

After &s;ome ribaldry with the other rowers, <HI>Ivo</HI> took up the board, and &s;haking it, found the alms box empty. Oh, Oh! now I under&s;tand him, (exclaimed <HI>Ivo</HI>) now I know the rea&s;on we cannot get a wind, my go&s;&s;ip will do nothing, not even for our lady her&s;elf, without an alms! Do pa&s;s him about among the noble company of Fidal|go's, and let every one give him &s;omething, as &s;oon as he hears the money chinking in his box, we &s;hall have a wind directly. When the alms were col|lected, <HI>Ivo</HI> &s;et the &s;aint down again before him. By and by, as I was become familiar to <HI>Ivo,</HI> I a&s;ked him where was the wind he had been &s;o long promi&s;ing us! He a&s;&s;ured me it would come, for that although his go&s;&s;ip was &s;ometimes &s;low, he never failed him. Soon afterwards, &s;ome of the rowers &s;aid <HI>S.

Do you hear go&s;&s;ip, (&s;aid <HI>Ivo</HI>) what my comrades are &s;aying of you; though they &s;peak truth, and you richly de&s;erve it all? No wind appearing, <HI>Ivo</HI> began to call <HI>S.

belly full of &s;alt water; he called him a fool, a drunkard, a thief, a cuckold, a <HI>(cabrao)</HI> pimp of his own wife, and told him he would break his horns for him, if he did not mind his bu&s;ine&s;s better.</P>
<P>Our men pulled away for an hour longer, without the lea&s;t &s;ign of any wind; at la&s;t, <HI>Ivo</HI> &s;tarting up in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, drew his &s;harp pointed knife, and pre&s;enting it to the face of the painting of <HI>S.

<P>Soon after this, we came nearly oppo&s;ite to a &s;ort of a valley, at the upper end of the city, from whence we had a breeze. Oh! you will con&s;ent then after all, will you, you old cuckold, after we have almo&s;t broken the bones of our arms with rowing: now you come with your &s;nivelling wind when we do not want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;cene &s;hifted, the Eternal Father was &s;een again de&s;cending, with great wrath.

Chri&s;topher</HI> &s;aid, he re|ally did not know where to find <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> at pre|&s;ent, but believed that he was with his father and mother, at Heliopolis, in Egypt. The devil &s;aid, he had not time to go &s;o far that night; but, to the be&s;t of his remembrance, he thought the little boy he had with him very much re&s;embled <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> when he &s;aw him, about 700 years &s;ince, going into the temple at Jeru&s;alem. The Saint a&s;&s;ured him that he was not <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and the little boy him&s;elf de|clared that, &s;o far from being <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he was only the &s;on of a poor Carpenter, at Nazareth, who, with the &s;weat of his brow, was &s;carce able to earn enough to purcha&s;e a couple of pilchards, and a bit of brown bread, for him&s;elf and his mother.</P>
<P>After this <HI>S. Chri&s;topher</HI> and the devil had a long conver&s;ation upon the nature of the Trinity, which concluded with the devil's telling the &s;aint it was
<PB N="362" REF="367">
&s;uch an intricate, contradictory piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, that he owned he could not comprehend a &s;yllable of it. Upon this the &s;aint tells the devil, he mu&s;t be a great blockhead, and a mo&s;t egregious a&s;s, for that nothing was more plain and &s;elf-evident; and that he would make it appear &s;o to him in an in&s;tant. On this he took up with his left hand the &s;kirt of his garment, and, with his right, making a fold of part of it, &s;aid, here is one; then, making another fold, here are two; afterwards, making a third; he a&s;ked him, if that was not three? and the other an&s;wering in the affirmative, the &s;aint dropped the folds, and &s;tretched out all that part of his garment between his hands in one piece, without any folds; and the devil, after &s;o palpable a demon&s;tration, acknowledged he clearly under&s;tood the Trinity.</P>
<P>This matter being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the little boy begged <HI>S. Chri&s;topher</HI> to carry him on his &s;houlders over a deep and rapid river, that ran near them; to this the &s;aint con&s;ented, though the devil cautioned him how he meddled with the boy, of whom he &s;till had his doubts who he really was. However, the &s;aint took him up, but, before he got to the middle of the river, was ready to &s;ink under his burden, and began to call out, at which the devil laughed heartily, and a&s;ked him why he would not follow his advice? The boy &s;aid to the devil, while on his &s;houlders, in the water, 'If <HI>Atlas</HI> had found the
<PB N="363" REF="368">
weight of the poles &s;uch a load that he could hardly bear it, no wonder, <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> that, though a giant, you &s;hould find me much heavier, who created not only the world, but the &s;un, the moon, and all the planetary &s;y&s;tem.' On the boy's &s;aying this, the &s;aint found him&s;elf relieved, and, &s;etting him down on the other &s;ide, fell upon his knees to wor&s;hip him; and then, making the &s;ign of the cro&s;s over the water, on the devil, the <HI>Prince of Darkne&s;s</HI> im|mediately vani&s;hed into flame and &s;moke, leaving a &s;trong &s;ulphureous &s;mell behind him.</P>
<P>The piece concluded with a &s;cene of &s;ome nuns in conver&s;ation with their gallants, at the parlour grate of a convent. After many bomba&s;t declara|tions of their pa&s;&s;ion, inter&s;per&s;ed with <HI>double en|tendres,</HI> the ladies de&s;ire the gentlemen to entertain them with a dance, which they do, by dancing &s;ome ob&s;cene dances, practi&s;ed only by the blacks, and this part of the entertainment meets with great applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The after-piece to this comedy was equally lu|dicrous. The &s;cene lay in a cobler's &s;hop, who was at work, with his wife near him, rather hand&s;ome than otherwi&s;e; and two friars, who ca&s;ting a leer|ing look at his wife, but were at the &s;ame time engaged in a deep di&s;pute with the cobler. One of the friars in&s;i&s;ted there could exi&s;t matter without
<PB N="364" REF="369">
form, while the other was as &s;trenuous in &s;upport|ing a contrary opinion, to which the cobler &s;eemed al&s;o inclined; whil&s;t his wife very prudently em|braced both opinions. In the mean time a young buck enters the &s;hop, and de&s;ires the cobler to mend the &s;trap of his &s;hoe-buckle. On this the cobler calls to his wife to know what money was in the hou&s;e? &s;he replies a piece-of-eight and &s;even reals. The cobler then turns to the buck, and a&s;ks him if he was not a&s;hamed to de&s;ire him to work for him, when he heard he had &s;o much money in the hou&s;e? and bids him get his &s;trap mended where he plea&s;ed, for he would work for no man while he was &s;o rich. The di&s;pute between matter and form &s;till went on, (in Portugue&s;e the words <HI>materia</HI> and <HI>forma</HI> &s;ignify matter and form; and the word <HI>forma</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ignifies a &s;hoemaker's la&s;t) the party who in&s;i&s;ted matter could exi&s;t without form, not producing one good rea&s;on in &s;upport of his argument, and being very ob&s;tinate, the cob|ler, on perceiving this, &s;aid, he would &s;oon con|vince him: &s;o, ri&s;ing from his tripod in a rage, and taking up his la&s;t or <HI>forma,</HI> he threw it with &s;uch force at his antagoni&s;t, as made a large cut on his forehead. 'Now, (&s;aid the cobler, exulting) after what my <HI>forma</HI> has done, I'll an&s;wer for it, there will be produced matter in abundance.' This turn of wit rai&s;ed great applau&s;e in the hou&s;e, after which the cobler, the friars, the buck, and the
<PB N="363" REF="370">
cobler's wife, being each provided with a leather, began beating one another round the &s;tage, to the great diver&s;ion of the &s;pectators; and this is the manner that the after-pieces in this country gene|rally end.</P>
<P>The manner of travelling in this country is &s;imi|lar to that in Spain, except that they have not &s;o many carriages, and go more by water, their towns lying more on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and the mouths of the great river, ri&s;ing in Spain, emptying them&s;elves here. Mules, or litters are mo&s;tly u&s;ed in travel|ling; their hor&s;es, which are very fiery and active, &s;erving only for &s;hort vi&s;its, or in cavalcades. The&s;e latter, not being &s;o &s;trong and &s;ure-footed, and con&s;equently le&s;s able to climb the mountains than the mules, is the rea&s;on that they are &s;carcely ever made u&s;e of in travelling.</P>
<P>No per&s;on in Li&s;bon is allowed to have hor&s;es to his carriage, except the royal family, foreign mini&s;ters, and a few others. Every one makes u&s;e of mules. Portugal is &s;aid not to abound in hor&s;es, and tho&s;e which the Portugue&s;e have, they are obliged to &s;muggle from Spain, the exportation of which are forbidden under very &s;evere penalties. There being no regular conveyances of carriages between the two kingdoms of Spain and Portugal for travellers, tho&s;e who do not choo&s;e to ride upon
<PB N="366" REF="371">
mules or to walk, are obliged to hire 2-wheel chai&s;es. The&s;e carriages are near, tolerably well hung, and drawn by mules, but travel&s;o very &s;low, that a per&s;on u&s;ed to the rapid mode of conveyance, by our mail-coaches and po&s;t-coaches, has need of all his patience to &s;upport the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the journey.</P>
<P>"In all the great towns and villages on the road to Oporto, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) although there are no car|riages to be met with, there are mi&s;erable little a&s;&s;es, con&s;tantly to be hired, which fly like lightning to the next town, where fre&s;h ones are to be had; but were you to beat them to death, they would not go one &s;tep further. This mode of travelling how|ever is not dear, being at the rate of two-pence each Portugue&s;e league, or not quite three farthings Engli&s;h per mile.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Commerce, Manufactures, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Portugue&s;e carry on a very exten&s;ive trade, from which they derive but little advantage, being obliged to vend not only their own products, but
<PB N="367" REF="372">
all the merchandize and riches brought home to them from their &s;ettlements in other parts of the globe, to the Europeans who trade with them, e&s;pe|cially the Engli&s;h; for their grain and manufactured goods of all kinds, with which they &s;upply Portu|gal, both for its home con&s;umption and its &s;ettle|ments abroad. The merchandize which the Por|tugue&s;e furni&s;h foreigners with, are, &s;ea-&s;alt, oil, wine, lemons, Seville and China oranges, figs, rai&s;ins, almonds, che&s;nuts, and other fruits, toge|ther with wool, &s;ilk, and other materials for manu|factures; but their chief commodities con&s;i&s;t of imports from their own colonies, particularly from Brazil; &s;uch as &s;ugars, tobacco, cocoa-nuts, ivory, ebony, Brazil-wood, hides, &s;pices, drugs, gold, pearls, diamonds, and other valuable gems.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e &s;hipping frequent but little the other countries of Europe or the Levant; their voyages lying rather to the coa&s;ts of Africa, particu|larly to the gold-coa&s;ts, whence they carry Negroes to the Brazils; they meet there al&s;o with &s;ome gold and ivory. They trade likewi&s;e to their Ea&s;t India colonies of Goa, Diu, and Macao; but this traffic, once &s;o very important, is now much upon the decline. Brazil, however, continues a very plenti|ful trea&s;ure to them. All foreigners are excluded from any commerce with Brazil; the Portugue&s;e, however, carry on a very con&s;iderable clande&s;tine
<PB N="368" REF="373">
traffic with the Spaniards, which con&s;i&s;ts principally in an exchange of gold and &s;ilver, by which each king is defrauded of his fifth. From Brazil, the Portugue&s;e bring not only &s;ugar and tobacco, but likewi&s;e gold and diamonds. Of the quantity of gold annually brought into Li&s;bon from thence, &s;ome conjecture may be made from the amount of the King's fifth, which, one year with another, is near 300,000l. con&s;equently the annual produce of gold in Brazil, may be e&s;timated at 2,000,000 &s;terling. The fleet, which &s;ails every year to Bra|zil, goes and returns in &s;even or eight months; and when homeward bound, is convoyed by &s;ome men of war. Ships from Africa or the Ea&s;t Indies come al&s;o in company with it.</P>
<P>The neglect of agriculture has been taken notice of already; and the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made of all arts and manufactures, although this country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the fine&s;t materials of all kinds, but the&s;e are di&s;po&s;ed of rough to foreigners. The Portu|gue&s;e, indeed, make a little linen, and different kinds of &s;traw-work, and candy different kinds of fruits, particularly oranges. They have likewi&s;e &s;ome coar&s;e &s;ilk and woollen manufactures; but the&s;e are trifling articles, and &s;upport but a very &s;mall part of the nation. It al&s;o very much concerns all foreigners trading to Portugal, and par|ticularly the Engli&s;h, that the Portugue&s;e do not
<PB N="369" REF="374">
apply them&s;elves to manufactures, and they are therefore very indu&s;trious (&s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI>) to pre|vent it; of which the manufactury for looking-gla&s;s &s;et up &s;ome few years &s;ince at Li&s;bon was a memorable in&s;tance.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Baretti,</HI> the only articles that the Portugue&s;e export to any very con&s;iderable amount, are oranges, lemons, and wine, which England takes from them in large quantities; but &s;till the balance of trade is very much in favour of the Engli&s;h, from the great demand for their manufac|tures in Portugal.</P>
<P>This branch of commerce the French and Dutch have long been endeavouring to get from the Engli&s;h. But their endeavours are not likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful. One rea&s;on is, that the Engli&s;h are more powerful at &s;ea than either the French or the Dutch, and there is &s;omething in &s;uperior &s;trength which will carry almo&s;t any point, among nations as well as among individuals. The other is, that neither the French or Dutch could purcha&s;e from the Portugue&s;e tho&s;e large quantities of fruit and wine which the Engli&s;h take in part of payment for what they furni&s;h. If the Portugue&s;e &s;hould be inclined to purcha&s;e the manufactures they re|ceive from England, either from the French or the Dutch; the Engli&s;h, without commencing ho&s;tili|ties,
<PB N="370" REF="375">
have only to provide them&s;elves el&s;ewhere with wine and fruit, and the Portugue&s;e are half-ru|ined. It is therefore probable that the commerce between Portugal and England will continue in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, as long as the inhabitants of this lat|ter country &s;hall continue fond of the bottle and the bowl; unle&s;s &s;ome &s;ingular revolution &s;hould happen in the government of the country of the former. And, according to <HI>Co&s;tigan,</HI> &s;ome &s;uch revolution &s;eems fa&s;t approaching; "for (&s;ays he) to my certain knowledge, the <HI>Prince of A&s;turias</HI> (who is now on the throne of Spain) has &s;aid, more than once, that he con&s;iders Portugal as a province wre&s;ted from him, which he will make it his bu&s;i|ne&s;s to re-unite to his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions." No doubt the project would be as ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed as the conque&s;t would be important, were not England to interfere, which does not &s;eem to enter at all into the calculation of the above writer.</P>
<P>Tobacco is not allowed to be cultivated in any part of Portugal under pain of death. All kinds of it, as well as &s;nuff, excepting tho&s;e which come from the Brazils, are &s;trictly prohibited. The tobacco is of two &s;orts, the one is dry leaves, the price of which is 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per pound; the other, rolled up in pieces of an inch thick, and five or &s;ix inches long. This &s;ort is very black, wet, and &s;tinking, and &s;ells at about half the
<PB N="371" REF="376">
price of the other. The &s;nuff is of the fine du&s;t, known in England by the name of Brazil &s;nuff.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual method of reckoning in Portugal is by reis and cru&s;ados; the fir&s;t is their &s;malle&s;t bra&s;s coin, 3000 of which are equal to a pound &s;terling; the other is a &s;ilver coin, of about two &s;hillings and eight-pence value. Their bra&s;s coins, as well as their &s;ilver ones, are of differ|ent degrees of value; &s;ome are &s;ingle reis, others reis and a half; and &s;ome are for five and ten reis. They have al&s;o &s;ilver coins, from 20 to 500 reis, be&s;ides which, they &s;tamp the number 600 on the Spani&s;h pieces of eight, to &s;ignify they may be taken for 600 reis. Their gold coins are, the moidore, valued at 4000 reis, the half moidore, quarter moidore, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Hi&s;tory, Con&s;titution, Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now give the leading traits in the Portu|gue&s;e hi&s;tory, from the time that the Moors made a
<PB N="372" REF="377">
conque&s;t of it in the eighth century, who divided it, like Spain, into a number of &s;mall principalities. In the 12th century, the Moors were driven from thence by <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> one of their counts, who was proclaimed king, by the name of <HI>Alphon&s;o I.</HI> It was not, however, till the 15th century, under <HI>John II.</HI> that the Portugue&s;e became powerful, and acquired any territories in the Indian &s;eas. This monarch projected the pa&s;&s;age round the Cape of Good Hope, to the Ea&s;t Indies, and built the ca&s;tle of Minas on the coa&s;t of Guinea. His predece&s;&s;or, <HI>Alphon&s;o V.</HI> had before taken &s;everal very &s;trong places on the African coa&s;t. <HI>John II.</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Emanuel,</HI> who married <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> daughter of <HI>Fer|dinand</HI> the Catholic: it was under him that Portugal arrived at the highe&s;t pitch of its glory. The Por|tugue&s;e were then &s;ole ma&s;ters of the commerce be|tween India and Europe, which had before been carried on by the Venetians, and other maritime &s;tates in the Mediterranean, through Egypt, and by the channel of the Red Sea. In making their fre|quent voyages into the Indian &s;eas, the Portugue&s;e, by chance, di&s;covered the Brazils in America, and &s;everal rich countries on the coa&s;t of Africa; from all which, flowed &s;uch immen&s;e trea&s;ures into Por|tugal, during this reign, as to give this period of their hi&s;tory the appellation of the golden age. <HI>Emanuel</HI> died in the beginning of the 16th century, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on, <HI>John III.</HI> who&s;e reign
<PB N="373" REF="378">
was fortunate and pro&s;perous. This monarch ap|plied his endeavours to re&s;tore arts and &s;ciences in Portugal, and to people tho&s;e colonies, which had been &s;o lately di&s;covered in A&s;ia, Africa, and Ame|rica. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, not &s;atisfied with the immen&s;e territories he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, undertook an expedition into Africa again&s;t the Moors, under pretence of rou&s;ing the courage of his &s;ubjects, and reviving that military di&s;cipline, which was almo&s;t lo&s;t &s;ight of, by a long continuance of peace and plenty. The opportunity &s;eemed favourable, the Moors having at that time ju&s;t depo&s;ed their &s;overeign. The i&s;&s;ue, however, proved di&s;a&s;trous. The Portugue&s;e advancing too far into the country, were &s;urrounded by a more nu|merous army of the Moors, and totally defeated. The king, and mo&s;t of the nobility who attended him, were &s;lain, and all the re&s;t either cut to pieces, or taken pri&s;oners. This blow the Portugue&s;e never recovered, but &s;oon after, fell under the dominion of Spain. This happened under <HI>Philip</HI> the Second's reign, who claimed the kingdom in right of his mo|ther, and &s;ent the <HI>Duke of Alva</HI> at the head of an ar|my to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> having thus united Portugal to Spain, the Portugue&s;e became great &s;ufferers by the union. For <HI>Philip</HI> being at that time endeavouring to re|duce his rebellious &s;ubjects in the Netherlands to their allegiance, thought nothing would &s;o much
<PB N="374" REF="379">
contribute to it, as prohibiting their carrying on any commerce, either with Spain or Portugal; but this prohibition turned out very contrary to his expec|tations; for the Dutch being excluded from trading with Spain and Portugal, from whence they u&s;ed to bring &s;pices and other valuable merchandi&s;e, fitted out &s;trong fleets them&s;elves; which they not only &s;ent to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, in &s;earch of the&s;e commodities, but likewi&s;e drove the Portugue&s;e from &s;ome of their be&s;t &s;ettlements in India, and different parts of A&s;ia, as well as from others that they had in the Brazils, and on the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>This exa&s;perated the Portugue&s;e &s;o much, that they would gladly have &s;haken off the Spani&s;h yoke; but <HI>Philip II.</HI> maintained his dominion over them, as did <HI>Philip III. Philip IV.</HI> al&s;o &s;ucceeded peace|ably to the united kingdoms, which he enjoyed about 19 years; but the Spaniards having been weak|ened by a long and expen&s;ive war with France, and the revolt of the Catalonians, the Portugue&s;e had a fair opportunity of delivering their country from the Spani&s;h yoke, which they embraced; and as the Duke of Braganza was the next in blood to their former princes, they made him an offer of the crown, of which he did not &s;eem very ambitious; but while revolving on the one hand, the danger of the enterprize; and on the other, the glory that
<PB N="375" REF="380">
would accrue to his country, and to his family in particular, if he &s;ucceeded; the court of Spain hav|ing &s;ome information of the de&s;ign, <HI>Philip</HI> &s;um|moned the Duke, and others of the Portugue&s;e no|bility, to attend him to the Catalonian war. The Duke &s;aw the &s;nare, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf as well as he could, pretending his finances were low; a re|mittance of 20,000 pi&s;toles were immediately &s;ent him, with a promi&s;e of accommodating him with more. Things being thus brought to a cri&s;is, the Duke con&s;ulted his Dutche&s;s on the occa&s;ion: &s;he was of the family of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> a prince&s;s of great &s;pirit, and is &s;aid to have an&s;wered him thus: 'Sir, if you go to Spain, you run the ri&s;k of your life; you do the &s;ame in attempting the crown of Portugal; but if you mu&s;t die, it is better to die a king than a duke:' and this it &s;eems, determined his choice. The whole kingdom of Portugal, and all their foreign &s;ettlements, unanimou&s;ly acknowledged him for their &s;overeign, except Ceuta, in which was a Spani&s;h governor. Thus was this &s;urpri&s;ing re|volution effected in an in&s;tant, without having co&s;t the lives of more than three people, one of which was the Viceroy, who, having in the commotion, concealed him&s;elf in his library, under a parcel of books, was betrayed by an old female &s;ervant, drag|ged forth, and put to death by the people: though it afterwards co&s;t a great deal of blood and trea&s;ure to maintain it. It was undertaken on the fir&s;t of
<PB N="376" REF="381">
December 1640, when in the &s;ervice of the church, for that day are the following words from St. Paul's Epi&s;tle to the Romans, ch. 13. v. ii. <HI>And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of &s;leep; for now is our &s;alvation nearer than when we believed.</HI> The&s;e words the Portugue&s;e did then, and have ever &s;ince regarded as an oracle from Hea|ven, declaring in their favour. Thus did this prince a&s;cend the throne of Portugal, and was proclaimed by the name of <HI>John IV.</HI> It was thought very &s;trange, that this de&s;ign &s;hould have been commu|nicated to above 200 per&s;ons, and a whole year taken up in preparation for its execution, and yet not be di&s;covered by the court of Spain, till it was too late to prevent it. The new King, however, had not been long upon the throne, before a plot was formed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>We will here enumerate the &s;everal countries, ter|ritories, and i&s;lands, &s;ubject to the crown of Portu|gal, which are, fir&s;t, the country of Brazil in Ame|rica: this is a va&s;t tract of land, extending along the &s;ea-coa&s;ts of South-America. It is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all their foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and yields great quantities of gold, tobacco, &s;ugar, cotton, gin|ger, indigo, hides, &amp;c. In Africa they have the fortre&s;s Ma&s;agan in the kingdom of Morocco, part of the Guinea coa&s;t; Angola on the coa&s;t of Con|go, with &s;ome i&s;lands on the Caffra coa&s;t; Zan|guebar,
<PB N="377" REF="382">
Mozambic, and Quiloa, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa. In the Atlantic ocean, they have the we&s;tern i&s;lands of the Azores, Madeira, and the i&s;lands of Cape Verde, and &s;ome others. In A&s;ia they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s Goa, Diu, Daman, and Chaul on the Indian coa&s;t, with a large extent of country, and the i&s;land of Macao on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of China, which, though under the government of the Chine&s;e, is inhabited chiefly by the Portugue&s;e. And here we cannot help remarking, what a noble empire the Portugue&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in A&s;ia and Africa, about 150 years ago. They were then ma&s;ters of Ormus and the Per&s;ian gulph; of all the coa&s;t of India, Siam, and Malacca; of the &s;ea-coa&s;ts on the i&s;lands of Su|matra, Java, and Ceylon; of the i&s;lands of Moluc|ca and Banda, where only the fine &s;pices are to be met with. They had e&s;tabli&s;hed their religion in the i&s;lands of Japan, where they made &s;uch a num|ber of pro&s;elytes, that the &s;overeigns, apprehen&s;ive of a general revolt, totally extirpated them, as well as their religion. They had al&s;o planted their religion throughout the va&s;t empire of China, and might have maintained it there, had not the je&s;uits inter|fered. There are now, indeed, no remains of it in either of the&s;e places, and the Dutch have expelled them from all their valuable &s;ettlements on the continent, and in the i&s;lands of A&s;ia, except Goa, and two or three more incon&s;iderable places. But they were &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the trade of the&s;e
<PB N="378" REF="383">
countries, and had &s;uch numerous &s;ettlements, that we find their language, with &s;ome corruption, &s;till prevailing in tho&s;e parts, and a mixed breed of Por|tugue&s;e and Indian, who imitate the Portugue&s;e in their religion, habits and cu&s;toms. On the ea&s;t|ern and we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa, their religion and language are al&s;o every where to be met with; though they have now very little power in that quar|ter of the globe.</P>
<P>The government of Portugal is an unlimited mo|narchy, but with re&s;pect to the impo&s;ition of new taxes, the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and other im|portant concerns, the con&s;ent of the &s;tates, which con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, principal nobility, and com|mons, is nece&s;&s;ary. The clergy are repre&s;ented, as in Spain, by the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; the prin|cipal nobility are the dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, counts, vi&s;|counts, and barons; and the repre&s;entatives of the commons, con&s;i&s;t of the procurators, or agents of the cities and towns. Among the commonalty, are al&s;o reckoned the lower nobility, and the ma&s;ter|&s;hips of the orders of knighthood. This a&s;&s;embly never meets, but by proclamation from the King, in which they are &s;tyled <HI>Cortes.</HI> The la&s;t was held in the year 1697. Although the crown of Portugal is hereditary, yet the con&s;ent of the &s;everal &s;tates is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of brother's children. The crown devolves to the female line, but this
<PB N="379" REF="384">
right is forfeited, if they marry out of the kingdom. In the year 1641, it was confirmed by a manife&s;to of the &s;tates, that in ca&s;es relating to &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the <HI>jus repre&s;entationis</HI> &s;hould be admitted.</P>
<P>The nobility are very numerous, and many of them of the blood-royal, being de&s;cended from na|tural &s;ons of the royal family. They were formerly more con&s;iderable than at pre&s;ent, although &s;o much of the ancient cu&s;tom, by which the King conferred a maintenance on the nobility, &s;till remains, that he a&s;&s;igns them a pen&s;ion from a certain fund, to enable them to maintain their dignity; and this is a memo|rial of the ancient <HI>moradias,</HI> as it was called, or at|tendance &s;alary. For &s;uch of the nobility as become impoveri&s;hed or di&s;abled in the king's &s;ervice, there is likewi&s;e a public foundation at Belem, not far from Li&s;bon, where they have every thing provided for them in a very decent manner. All tho&s;e who are grandees, and &s;tiled Dons, like tho&s;e of Spain, con&s;i&s;t of three cla&s;&s;es, and receive from the royal trea&s;ury, a pen&s;ion &s;ufficient to &s;upport their re&s;pec|tive dignities. The inferior nobility or gentry are termed <HI>Fidalgos;</HI> and are incapable of bearing the title of don, unle&s;s by permi&s;&s;ion from the king. The <HI>Macos Fidalgos,</HI> or gentlemen born, are ac|counted of higher rank than citizens, who acquire the title of <HI>Cavallero Fidalgo,</HI> without being enobled by it.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="385">The King's elde&s;t &s;on is &s;tiled <HI>Prince of Brazil;</HI> the other children and brothers being called In|fants.

<P>The principal order of knighthood in this king|dom, is the order of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in&s;tituted by <HI>King Dennis,</HI> &s;oon after the abolition of the Knights Templars, and confirmed in the year 1319, by <HI>Pope John XXII.</HI> The in&s;ignia of this is a red cro&s;s within a white one. The &s;eat of the order is at the city of Thomar. It has 454 Commanders. Concerning the origin of the order of <HI>S. James,</HI> writers differ, but it is &s;aid to have been rai&s;ed about the year 1030, from the fraternity of &s;ome other orders; and to have received the confirma|tion of <HI>Pope Alexander III.</HI> The badge of this or|der is a red &s;word, in the &s;hape of a cro&s;s, re|&s;embling the handles of ancient &s;words. To this order belong 47 &s;mall towns, and places, and 150 commanderies, be&s;ides the &s;plendid convent of <HI>Santos o Novo,</HI> to the we&s;t of Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The third order in Portugal, that of Aviz, is &s;aid to have been in&s;tituted &s;o early as the year 1147, by <HI>King Alphon&s;o Henriques.</HI> The &s;eat of
<PB N="381" REF="386">
this order is at Aviz, in the province of Alentejo. Its commanderies are only 49 in number, and the badge belonging to it, a green cro&s;s, in the form of a lily. The&s;e three orders are all religious, with li|berty of marriage to the knights. The Kings of Portugal are perpetual Grand Ma&s;ters. The Knights of Malta have likewi&s;e 23 commanderies here.</P>
<P>All the principal affairs of the kingdom are tran&s;acted in the council of &s;tate, who have the di&s;po&s;al of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical and temporal po&s;ts and offices, not immediately dependent on &s;ome other board or tribunal; but even the&s;e, at la&s;t, come before the council of &s;tate; particularly the nomi|nation of the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, viceroys, captains general, governors of provinces, &amp;c. is determined in this council. Peace and war, em|ba&s;&s;ies, alliances, &amp;c. are likewi&s;e canva&s;&s;ed in it. The council is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t in&s;tituted by <HI>Queen Catharine,</HI> during the minority of <HI>King Seba&s;|tian.</HI> In the year 1732, it con&s;i&s;ted of five eccle&s;i|a&s;tics and an equal number of lay officers. The &s;ecretary of &s;tate is al&s;o a member of it, and is a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by the official mayor and others.</P>
<P>The council of the palace is the highe&s;t tribunal to which cau&s;es may be brought from inferior courts by appeal. It nominates to all offices be|longing
<PB N="382" REF="387">
to the law, decides di&s;putes of juri&s;diction between the lay and &s;piritual courts, examines the briefs of the Pope's Nuncios, and, be&s;ides a great variety of other bu&s;ine&s;s, draws up all laws, orders, edicts, confirmations, privileges, grants, &amp;c. This court con&s;i&s;ts of a pre&s;ident, and &s;everal coun|&s;ellors, who&s;e number is not limited.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;a da Supplicaca</HI> is the fir&s;t and highe&s;t tribunal of ju&s;tice, being without appeal in civil or criminal ca&s;es. For the inferior admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice each of the &s;ix provinces of which the kingdom con&s;i&s;ts, is divided into judicial di&s;tricts, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of towns and villages. The&s;e again are &s;ub-divided into inferior juri&s;dictions. There is al&s;o another divi&s;ion of them. All juri&s;|dictions are either <HI>Correicoens,</HI> or <HI>Ouvidorias.</HI> The former belong to the crown, the latter to the <HI>Donatorios,</HI> who are partly eccle&s;ia&s;tics and partly laymen. The judge, whom the crown appoints for its di&s;trict, is &s;tiled Corregidor, and the donatorian is &s;tiled Ouvidor. The Roman law, with the glo&s;&s;aries, is recognized in Portugal; be&s;ides which there are royal edicts, and the ca|non law, and Pope's mandates.</P>

&s;entences are obtained in favour of that party which can mu&s;ter the mo&s;t powerful <HI>Empenhos,</HI> pre&s;erving only the exterior forms and appearance of ju&s;tice; and the&s;e, for evident rea&s;ons, are duly executed. In criminal proce&s;&s;es, when the truth is even come at, and &s;entence duly pa&s;&s;ed, it is &s;eldom or ever put in execution, unle&s;s indeed when a culprit is declared innocent; for then, with a &s;mall <HI>Empenho,</HI> he commonly obtains his liberty; and even when capitally convicted, he can, by the &s;ame means, obtain an eternal pro|rogation of the execution of the &s;entence.</P>
<P>"An <HI>Empenho</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) is the act whereby a per&s;on in habits of friend&s;hip or intimate ac|quaintance with another, inve&s;ted with power or authority, interpo&s;es earne&s;tly with him in fa|vour of a third per&s;on, in order to procure for him &s;ome &s;pecial favour, he does not always de|&s;erve; or to avert from him the impo&s;ition of tho&s;e pains and penalties to which he becomes liable by law."</P>
<P>We will here give an example on this head, which may enable our readers to form &s;ome idea of what the point of honour is to be held in this country. Two cou&s;ins-german, both men of &s;ome property, one a widower, living upon his e&s;tate, with a maiden &s;i&s;ter to take care of
<PB N="384" REF="389">
his family, the other an officer in a regiment of infantry; entertained a mo&s;t violent jealou&s;y of each other, on account of a lady to whom they both made preten&s;ions; this jealou&s;y aro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch of frantic rage, on the part of the widower, that he went out one day well armed, and accom|panied by &s;ervants, and meeting his cou&s;in the of|ficer, ordered him to be &s;eized, and in his pre&s;ence, hor&s;e-whipped by a negro &s;lave he brought with him for the purpo&s;e; the officer being without arms, and unprovided for &s;uch an attack, after re|ceiving the &s;tripes, laid hold of his own beard, and told him he &s;hould certainly pay him for &s;uch an atrocious in&s;ult; the widower, who perfectly un|der&s;tood the meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion, left this part of the country for above three years, retiring into the kingdom of Gallicia, after which, thinking his cou&s;in's pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be in &s;ome degree cooled, he returned to his e&s;tate, never venturing, however, abroad, but in the &s;ame litter with his &s;i&s;ter, not &s;uppo&s;ing any cavalier would be rude enough to attack him in the company of a lady; in the mean while, the officer, from the time he was hor&s;e-whip|ped, never appeared more in the regiment, never went to ma&s;s, nor &s;haved his beard, having &s;olemnly &s;worn to do neither of the three till he had taken, what is here reckoned &s;atisfaction, for &s;uch an af|front; he continued all the whole time &s;kulking about the country, di&s;gui&s;ed like a hermit, and hav|ing
<PB N="385" REF="390">
found his cou&s;in was returned, he got together &s;ome companions, and way-laid him near his hou&s;e, as he was returning to it one evening with his &s;i&s;ter in the litter, which he &s;topped, and telling the lady he had &s;ome little bu&s;ine&s;s with her brother, mo&s;t politely de&s;ired &s;he would alight; he then took a pi&s;tol from his &s;leeve, and applied to his cou&s;ins forehead, and after di&s;charging the contents, drag|ged him out of the litter, and di&s;charged another through his heart, as he lay weltering in his blood: this being done, he a&s;ked a thou&s;and pardons of the lady, for having &s;o far incommoded her, and begged to know where &s;he wi&s;hed to be con|ducted? She &s;ignified a de&s;ire to retire to a con|vent about ten miles from where the cata&s;trophe happened, where &s;he had an only &s;i&s;ter, a nun; and the officer, like a gallant cavalier, conducted and lodged her &s;afely with her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>This done, he returned to his regiment, re|ported him&s;elf fit for duty, and dre&s;&s;ed and ap|peared on the parade as u&s;ual; and the rumour of this cowardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination getting wind, he readily acknowledged it, and what was more a&s;toni&s;hing, all the nobility and officers in the neighbourhood ju&s;tified the action, &s;aying, it was the lea&s;t a man of rank and credit could do to retrieve his reputa|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="391">Mean time, the whole proce&s;s of the murder, with the examination of the witne&s;&s;es, to which the civil magi&s;trate of the di&s;trict is by law enjoined to proceed, within a limited time after notice of the &s;ame, was remitted to the commanding officer of the regiment; on whom it was incumbent, as the delinquent was of the army, to order his being tried by a court-martial, agreeable to the articles of war. This was accordingly done, and &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed on him, which would have been put in immediate execution, had it not been for the &s;trong and numberle&s;s <HI>Empenhos</HI> his relations made for him at court, whereby the King changed his &s;entence, ordering him to be broke at the head of his regiment, his uniform to be &s;tripped from his back, his &s;a&s;h cut in two, his &s;word to be broken before him, and he him&s;elf to be bani&s;hed for ten years to the kingdom of Angola, in Africa. The fir&s;t part of his &s;entence was executed, and he was kept in pri&s;on to be tran&s;ported by the fir&s;t oppor|tunity; but &s;trange to relate, the pre&s;ent Queen, on the change of admini&s;tration, not only pardoned every thing, but ordered him to be re&s;tored to his po&s;t in the regiment.</P>
<P>The revenues of the crown amount to about 3,500,000 &s;terling. There ari&s;e from the hereditary e&s;tates of the hou&s;e of Braganza, from the royal de|me&s;nes, and from the cu&s;toms and duties on goods,
<PB N="387" REF="392">
which are exce&s;&s;ive. Foreign merchandize like|wi&s;e pays 23 percent, on importation, and fi&s;h from Newfoundland, 25 per cent. Fi&s;h taken in the ad|joining &s;eas and rivers, pays 27 per cent. and the tax upon lands and hou&s;es, when &s;old, is 10 per cent. The King likewi&s;e draws a con&s;iderable revenue from the &s;everal orders of knighthood, of which, as it is ob&s;erved, he is grand ma&s;ter. His revenue has al&s;o been greatly increa&s;ed by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the je&s;uits, and other religious orders. By the &s;ale of indulgencies, a large &s;um is annually levied. This privilege the pope renews to the King every three years, by a &s;pecial bull, including three others, namely, a bull for the living, a bull for the dead, and a bull of compo&s;ition, by virtue of which, the payment of certain part of an iniquitous gain, ren|ders the re&s;t legal. The monopoly of Brazil &s;nuff produces a con&s;iderable revenue. In 1755, this ar|ticle was farmed for 3,000,000 of cru&s;ados. We have already ob&s;erved that the King has likewi&s;e one fifth of all the gold brought from Brazil, e&s;timated one year with another, at 300,000l. To this may be added, the farm of the Brazil diamonds. No wonder, therefore, his revenue is &s;o very ample, con|&s;idering the extent of the country.</P>
<P>The military force in Portugal, con&s;i&s;ts of 38 re|giments of foot, each of 820 men, including officers; and 12 regiments of cavalry, of 400 hor&s;e to each.
<PB N="388" REF="393">
The hor&s;es are of different &s;izes and colours, and make a very uncouth appearance. In their troops are a great number of Briti&s;h officers, who are mo&s;tly Prote&s;tants and Scotchmen. It appears from <HI>Baret|ti,</HI> that &s;ince the war in 1762, there has been a con|&s;iderable reform in the Portugue&s;e army, and that their &s;oldiers, which before were &s;ome of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t beggarly looking troops in Europe, are now in general picked men, and as well di&s;ciplined as the Pru&s;&s;ians them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>S. Anthony</HI> of Padua was formerly (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) the generali&s;&s;imo of the Portugue&s;e army; his appoint|ments were 300,000 reis, or about 87l. a year; but lately the Count <HI>de La Lippe,</HI> &s;upplied the Saint's place, who, it appears, has introduced a con&s;ider|able reform into the army. This officer (&s;ays <HI>Twi&s;s</HI>) was formerly governor of Almeida, and the whole province of Beira, and is in every re&s;pect, worthy of the high dignity to which he is rai&s;ed. He has been in the Portugue&s;e &s;ervice ever &s;ince the year 1763. The Briti&s;h officers here have the &s;ame pay as in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, which is double that of the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>The mode of recruiting the army in Portugal, (&s;ays <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI>) is &s;imilar to that in Spain, and totally different from that which is practi&s;ed in England. Each of the provinces, as we have already ob&s;erved,
<PB N="389" REF="394">
is divided into di&s;tricts, and the civil magi&s;trate of every di&s;trict, is obliged to furni&s;h the number of recruits allotted him, when called upon by govern|ment; and &s;uch recruits mu&s;t be the &s;ons of merchants, trade&s;men, pea&s;ants, labourers, &amp;c. &amp;c. inhabitants of that di&s;trict; and the father, brother, &s;ome rela|tion, or other &s;ufficient per&s;on, is made re&s;pon&s;ible for each recruit, that he &s;hall behave well, and not de&s;ert his colours; and if he does, that per&s;on is obliged to find another to &s;erve in his place, for whom he mu&s;t al&s;o be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>They have even required this pledge of re&s;pon&s;i|bility from <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> the titular &s;aint of Li&s;bon, whom their bigotry has appointed captain in one of their regiments, and for who&s;e &s;ecurity, the Queen of Angels, for &s;o they &s;tile the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> is made re&s;pon&s;ible. <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI> has tran&s;cribed a curious me|morial, &s;igned by the commanding officer of the re|giment, and bearing date &s;o late in the pre&s;ent cen|tury, as the year 1777, which was pre&s;ented to the prime mini&s;ter, praying that <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> who had been a captain in his regiment ever &s;ince the year 1688, and had con&s;tantly done his duty with the greate&s;t alacrity at the head of his company, upon all occa&s;ions, both in peace and war, might be ap|pointed aggregate-major of the &s;aid regiment. 'I do certify (&s;ays the Major) that having carefully examined all the papers and regi&s;ters of the regi|ment

&s;ince its fir&s;t formation, there is not any note of bad behaviour or irregularity committed by <HI>S.

Anthony</HI> had at different times performed in the regiment, in con&s;equence of his having a place in it: among others, he had re&s;tored a favourite lap-dog to the commanding officer's lady, which had been &s;tolen from her, and which &s;he had de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing again, till her Father Director advi&s;ed her to importune <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> which &s;he had no &s;ooner done, than the dog was brought back to her! He al&s;o &s;aved a poor &s;oldier, who called upon him when drowning, as he pa&s;&s;ed a deep river, by miraculou&s;ly throwing a rope in his way! Another had recovered from the &s;mall-pox, by thinking on <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> and this after the rattle was in his throat, and he had been given over by the &s;urgeon-major of the regi|ment! In &s;hort, another certificate related, that a drummer of the regiment being in bed with his wife, and their child &s;leeping between them, when he waked in the morning, found a large &s;nake, which had crept in under the door of the hut, in bed with them, &s;ucking his wife's brea&s;t, while &s;he was fa&s;t a&s;leep, with its tail in the mouth of the child, who was &s;ucking at it very contentedly: at &s;ight of &s;uch an extraordinary appearance, the drummer imme|diately invoked the captain of the regiment, <HI>S. An|thony,</HI> who in&s;pired him with pre&s;ence of mind and
<PB N="392" REF="397">
courage, &s;ufficient to &s;eize at once, the head and tail of the &s;erpent; by this time, overloaded with the quantity of milk he had &s;ucked, and &s;etting a foot upon each, &s;ecured him from doing them any mi&s;chief, till, with his hanger, which lay at his bed's-head, he cut the animal's head off, and mangled it &s;o, as to prevent it from hurting them. Thus the man, wife and child, had a miraculous e&s;cape.</P>

which, by <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> and <HI>Newton,</HI> had been driven from other parts of Europe; and at their univer&s;i|ties, the mind (he &s;ays) is ob&s;cured with the ab&s;truce di&s;qui&s;ition of &s;chola&s;tic learning. According to him, <HI>Gallileo, De&s;cartes, Ga&s;&s;endi</HI> and <HI>Newton,</HI> are in Portugal, the names of athei&s;ts and heretics, not to be mentioned, but with marks of execration; and la&s;tly he affirms, that the profe&s;&s;or of anatomy in a Portugue&s;e univer&s;ity, is allowed only two &s;heep a year for demon&s;trating his lectures. If this be go|ing too far, let us hear what a Portugue&s;e him&s;elf, <HI>D'Olivaira</HI> &s;ays. In the preface to the fir&s;t volume of his memoirs, he u&s;es the&s;e remarkable words: 'In our country we live in ignorance without know|ing it; but in going out of Portugal, our eyes &s;eem &s;uddenly to open, and we immediately &s;ee that igno|rance, in which we were involved. The ignorance I &s;peak of (&s;ays he) is evident: foreigners allow us un|der&s;tanding, docility, morals, di&s;cernment, and a genius for comprehending what is commendable and good; but our conceit, our gravity, our confined manner of living, which deprives us of all freedom of thought, expo&s;es us to ju&s;t cen&s;ures, and give ri&s;e to tho&s;e hateful opinions which other nations en|tertain of us. The main &s;ource of our ignorance, and a mi&s;erable cau&s;e of offence to all nations, is the cu&s;tom in Portugal, of prohibiting &s;uch numbers of books.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="400"><HI>Baretti,</HI> in mentioning the &s;tate of literature in this country, ob&s;erves, that few of their writers ever had a name, even before the earthquake committed that ravage on their literature. <HI>O&s;&s;orio,</HI> the Latin hi&s;torian, was certainly a name of &s;ome con&s;idera|tion in the literary world; and the fame of <HI>Camoens,</HI> the Portugue&s;e Epic Poet, has travelled beyond Alcenteja and E&s;tramadura. Yet the works of the&s;e two, their mo&s;t celebrated authors, are more com|mended than read. One of their &s;acred writers, (adds <HI>Baretti</HI>) called <HI>Vieira,</HI> is in high e&s;teem with the Portugue&s;e; I opened one of his volumes in the library of the royal convent at Mafra, and chance directed my eyes to a &s;ermon, where the perfec|tions of the circular figure were pompou&s;ly enume|rated; after which the <HI>Lu&s;itanian Cicero,</HI> as he is &s;tyled by the Portugue&s;e, proceeds to tell his audi|ence that <HI>if the Supreme Being were to &s;hew him&s;elf under any geometrical figure, it would be the circular one, in preference to the triangular, the &s;quare, the pentagonal, the duodecagonal, or any other known to the geometricians.</HI> Such is the di&s;play of literature, by an author in high repute with the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>They have a tran&s;lation of the operas of <HI>Meta&s;ta|&s;io,</HI> to which by way of embelli&s;hment, the tran&s;la|tor has added &s;cenes of his own, in which, when the heroes of the opera go out, their place is &s;up|plied by the &s;ervants, chamber-maid, and nur&s;es of
<PB N="396" REF="401">
the principal characters, who are introduced, hold|ing dialogues together. <HI>Achilles</HI> has his running footman, <HI>Semiramis</HI> her dry-nur&s;e; and <HI>Deidamia</HI> has a little prating hu&s;&s;ey of a cook-maid, who bids the Negro-boy carry chocolate to his mi&s;tre&s;s. Such is the dramatic ta&s;te in Portugal; of which we have already given &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;pecimens, under the article of amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, however, have a dictionary of their own language, which is much commended both by them&s;elves and by foreigners. But it does not appear to have been the work of a native. It is &s;aid to be a compilation of Father <HI>Bluteau,</HI> a French Je&s;uit. It is printed in eight or nine large quarto volumes.</P>
<P>"In a medical treati&s;e, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) that I met with in the royal library, I read of a remedy for &s;ore eyes, not a little curious. <HI>'The per&s;on thus afflicted,</HI> (remarks the Portugue&s;e Phy&s;ician) <HI>mu&s;t not read, nor fix his eyes upon any thing that is white.'</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;colas Nece&s;&s;idades,</HI> the principal &s;eminary in Li&s;bon, is a Philippine convent; and, of cour&s;e, the profe&s;&s;ors are Philippine friars. The Je&s;uits were formerly indulged with the exclu&s;ive privi|lege of in&s;tructing the Portugue&s;e youth at Li&s;bon; but, &s;oon after their expul&s;ion, this honour was
<PB N="397" REF="402">
conferred on the Philippines. "It is a certain fact, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) that the Je&s;uits, in Italy, endeavoured to &s;ubvert all literature." His arguments in favour of this po&s;ition are, that, before this order was in&s;tituted, there were in that country &s;o many eminent writers, in various branches of &s;cience, from <HI>Dante</HI> to <HI>Ga|lileo,</HI> as few countries could boa&s;t. "But, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) the Je&s;uits had no &s;ooner got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;chools, under pretext of in&s;tructing our youth <HI>gratis,</HI> than there was an almo&s;t total ce&s;&s;ation of hi&s;torians, politicians, philo&s;ophers, and poets. They began by di&s;couraging an application to the Greek language, a&s;&s;erting that it was totally unnece&s;&s;ary. Afterwards, by means of their voluminous Latin grammars, they rendered the &s;tudy of this language, next to impo&s;&s;ible; as it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to learn any thing by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;omething equal|ly unknown to us. They even contaminated our language, by inundating it with &s;uch a deluge of equivocal wit, as to make us the ridicule of tho&s;e nations of whom we were before the admiration.</P>
<P>In Portugal, to have &s;ub&s;tituted the Philippians for the Je&s;uits, has not added much to the literary fame of the country. It is however intended to put the &s;eminaries in the capital on a more re&s;pectable footing than they are at pre&s;ent. A univer&s;ity is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed at Li&s;bon, into which &s;ome Coim|bra profe&s;&s;ors are to be incorporated, and the an|cient
<PB N="398" REF="403">
one in that city to be totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Per|haps the time is fa&s;t approaching, when the Por|tugue&s;e will likewi&s;e emerge from ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition, and put them&s;elves on a level, at lea&s;t, with &s;ome of the Catholic nations.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Chri&s;tianity was propagated here by the <HI>Apo&s;tles James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> &s;o early as the fir&s;t century, which the Portugue&s;e a&s;&s;ert, cannot be proved. But it is certain, as appears from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that it was received all over Spain, to which Portugal was then annexed, in the &s;econd century; and in the third, new pari&s;hes were formed. In &s;ucceeding times the Moors and Jews, who had been much increa&s;ing, lived intermingled with the Chri&s;tians; and, not|with&s;tanding the &s;evere per&s;ecutions, under <HI>John II.</HI> whereby they were forced, externally, to acknow|ledge the Romi&s;h church, and though all exerci&s;e of the Jewi&s;h religion be &s;till prohibited by the
<PB N="399" REF="404">
fundamental laws of the kingdom, yet there are great numbers of &s;ecret Jews among the Portugue&s;e, even at pre&s;ent, and tho&s;e too even among the nobility, bi&s;hops, prebends, monks, and nuns; and the very inqui&s;itors them&s;elves. Many, unable to conceal them&s;elves, e&s;cape into Holland, and there openly profe&s;s Judai&s;m. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country, however, is the Roman Catholic: and the inqui&s;ition, which was introduced by <HI>King John III.</HI> and has &s;ince been &s;et up throughout all the Portugue&s;e dominions, Brazil excepted, is very active in detecting here&s;ies and heretics; and no le&s;s rigorous in puni&s;hing them. Of the inqui&s;itions in Portugal there are four high courts, at Li&s;bon, Co|imbra, Evora, and Goa in the Ea&s;t Indies, each of which is independent, though with &s;ome &s;ubordi|nation to the &s;upreme council of inqui&s;ition. Im|pious and inhuman as this tribunal is, yet its fe&s;ti|val, or &s;olemn burnings, called <HI>auto da f&eacute;,</HI> or 'the act of faith,' afford the highe&s;t delight to the bigot|ed Portugue&s;e, who, whil&s;t their fellow-creatures, the &s;uppo&s;ed heretics, are burning in flames, &s;hout <HI>Que grande clemencia! Bente abencoado &s;ea o &s;anto officio! i. e.</HI> 'O what great goodne&s;s! Prai&s;ed be the holy office!' Even the principal nobility deem it an honour to lead the condemned criminals, like mean &s;ervants, to the &s;take. <HI>King John IV.</HI> how|ever, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, curtailed the power of the holy office, commanding that all its &s;entences
<PB N="400" REF="405">
&s;hould be laid before the parliament; and that the accu&s;ed &s;hould be allowed coun&s;el for their de|fence. He likewi&s;e further enacted, that only bla&s;|phemy, &s;odomy, polygamy, here&s;y, &s;orcery, Pagan cu&s;toms, and the conver&s;ion of the Jews, are to come under their cognizance. To be a <HI>Chri&s;tam Velho, i. e.</HI> an ancient Chri&s;tian, or of an ancient Chri&s;tian race, is accounted, in Portugal, a very great pre|eminence, and far above a <HI>Chri&s;tam-novo,</HI> or newly converted Chri&s;tian; or a <HI>temparte de Chri&s;tam novo,</HI> a half new converted Chri&s;tian, by which la&s;t are to be under&s;tood, tho&s;e who&s;e new converted ance&s;tors married ancient Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>No &s;overeigns have &s;hewn them&s;elves more zealous for the Catholic religion than the Kings of Spain and Portugal, who have &s;uffered the inqui&s;ition to ravage their territories for &s;uch a number of years. Nor are the people le&s;s devout than their &s;ove|reigns. It is not unu&s;ual even for the fair &s;ex to re&s;ort to the churches &s;even or eight times a day, though this has been &s;ugge&s;ted to ari&s;e from an in|clination to gallantry and rambling abroad, they being never &s;uffered to leave their hou&s;es but to go to their devotions. The Portugue&s;e are, in general, great admirers of the external pomp and &s;plendour of church wor&s;hip. In the holy week they practi&s;e great &s;everities upon them&s;elves; &s;ome will procure them&s;elves to be fa&s;tened to a cro&s;s, in their &s;hirts,
<PB N="401" REF="406">
with their arms extended, in imitation of our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour, uttering all the time the mo&s;t di&s;mal groans and lamentations. Others will walk bare|footed, over rocks and mountains, to &s;ome di&s;tant &s;hrine, in order to perform their devotions. Dur|ing Lent, in tho&s;e parts of Portugal which are at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, they eat only the entrails of bea&s;ts. At this holy &s;ea&s;on, friars and prie&s;ts may be &s;een in all the great &s;treets and &s;quares, preach|ing to the people, but applying to their pa&s;&s;ions rather than to their under&s;tandings. The preacher frequently beats his brea&s;t, and weeps, in the mid&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the people follow his example.</P>
<P>Solemn proce&s;&s;ions are very frequent in Portu|gal, but the mo&s;t con&s;iderable one is on Good Friday, when all the religious orders attend with the members of the &s;everal tribunals and councils, and &s;omtimes even the king him&s;elf, followed by his whole court, with wax torches in their hands; and the &s;ervants of the nobility, and people of di&s;|tinction, following their ma&s;ters with lighted flam|beaux. Upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion every thing wears a mournful appearance, the guards, who likewi&s;e at|tend, have their arms covered with black, as are the drums, which beat a dead march, in the &s;ame manner that they do at the funeral of a general. The trumpets, and other mu&s;ical in&s;truments, &s;ound
<PB N="402" REF="407">
mo&s;t di&s;mally; and all the &s;tandards and cro&s;&s;es are covered with black crape. True penitents, in the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions, la&s;h and cut them&s;elves unmer|cifully, hoping to implore the protection of Heaven by this holy violence; whil&s;t others are no le&s;s &s;e|vere upon them&s;elves, to &s;hew their pa&s;&s;ion for their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who &s;tand in balconies to &s;ee the pro|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such are the religious ceremonies of the Portu|gue&s;e, on days of fa&s;ting and humiliation; but on their fe&s;tivals the &s;cene is very different; then all the trea&s;ures of their churches are expo&s;ed to pub|lic view. The balconies and windows are hung with tape&s;try, and the ladies, dre&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t mag|nificent attire, are permitted to view the proce&s;&s;ion of the images, without any lattices before them. The images, together with the relics and trea&s;ures of the churches, are on the&s;e occa&s;ions accompa|nied by the nobility, in their habits of gala, pre|ceded by mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>The&s;e fe&s;tivals are generally concluded by &s;ome comedy, wretchedly acted, containing a repre|&s;entation of the life and actions of &s;ome of their &s;aints, taken from their legends; and from the familiarity with which not only the &s;aints, but even our Saviour is treated, &s;eem calculated rather to ridicule than promote Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="408">The following anecdote will &s;hew the extreme bigotry that reigns among the mo&s;t exalted ranks of people in this country, and which could not be carried to a greater height even in the capital of the Papal dominions. Some thieves, during the reign of the pre&s;ent Queen, having broken into a country church, about four leagues from Li&s;bon, and, rummaging in the dark for plate, and other plunder, among the altars, happened to overturn or break open a pix, containing &s;everal con&s;ecrated wafers; which were found next morn|ing, &s;trewed on the ground, near the altar; and, to add to the misfortune, &s;ome of them were &s;till mi&s;&s;ing. When the&s;e circum&s;tances were reported to the Queen, they threw her into the deepe&s;t af|fliction; &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up, and was invi&s;ible for three days; after which, &s;he &s;aid, all the mis|fortunes of her late father's reign, and the judg|ments with which God had vi&s;ited him, &s;uch as earthquakes, the expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits, and the war which followed, were, all together, no|thing, when compared to the grievous in&s;ult, of|fered to the body of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf; and which it became her duty to apologize for, after the mo&s;t &s;ignal manner po&s;&s;ible; and, after holding a con&s;ultation with the grave&s;t and mo&s;t orthodox divines, the whole court were ordered into deep mourning for nine days, at the end of which there was a general proce&s;&s;ion to the dif|ferent
<PB N="404" REF="409">
churches, in which the Queen her&s;elf, and the court walked in proce&s;&s;ion, and which was called the proce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>di&s;aggravation,</HI> and, by performing of which, they conceived, they &s;hould appea&s;e the wrath of the Deity, who had &s;uffered &s;uch a gro&s;s affront, by a few wafers be|ing thrown about and lo&s;t; as if there were any connexion between the Omnipotent Creator of the univer&s;e and a wafer.</P>
<P>What a crowd of reflexions does not &s;uch flagrant and inveterate folly pre&s;ent to the con&s;ideration of every &s;en&s;ible and &s;erious per&s;on! Here we plainly &s;ee into what a train of gro&s;s, ludicrous, and im|pious &s;ituations, this belief of the real pre&s;ence mu&s;t continually bring them; for ever led a&s;tray by the in&s;olent and bla&s;phemous opinion, that the Deity re&s;embles a cruel and &s;u&s;picious tyrant, they think to appea&s;e every &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult offered him, by &s;lavi&s;h and over-weening humiliations, in order to anticipate the effects of that vengeance he was ju&s;t about to wreak upon them.</P>
<P>The number of convents in Portugal is &s;aid to be no fewer than 900; and mo&s;t of them are very rich. The mo&s;t remarkable and wealthy is the convent of the Ci&s;tercians at Alcobaca.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, <HI>John V.</HI> at a
<PB N="405" REF="410">
very great expence, procured a patriarch, obtain|ing, in 1716, the Pope's licence to rai&s;e his court-chapel at Li&s;bon to a patriarchate; and, in the year following, the new patriarch, who al&s;o retained the title of fir&s;t court-chaplain, was in&s;talled, with very great &s;olemnity. In 1739, the Pope further granted, that the patriarch &s;hould always be a cardi|nal, and of the royal family. The patriarchal church at Li&s;bon was erected into a palatinate, and the fourth part of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in Portugal a&s;&s;igned for the &s;upport of the new canons. Next are three archbi&s;hops, who rank with mar|qui&s;&s;es; and of them, the fir&s;t is the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Braganza,</HI> who is primate of the kingdom. The bi&s;hops hold the rank of counts. Exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e in Europe, the Portugue&s;e have al&s;o archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, in the other three parts of the world.</P>
<P>The King, be&s;ides the nomination of all bi&s;hops, receives one fourth of their revenue, but this is ge|nerally given away in pen&s;ions. The Pope confirms the bi&s;hops, publi&s;hes his bulls in the kingdom, with|out any previous con&s;ent of the King, and, by his legate, governs the clergy; who with re&s;pect to taxes and contributions, depend upon him. He has al&s;o the gift of many &s;mall prebends. The &s;ums ari&s;ing to the legates, from the&s;e prerogatives are thought to exceed the revenues of the crown, and the nuncios &s;eldom fail of realizing immen&s;e for|tunes before they return to Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="411">The pomp and &s;plendour with which the &s;ove|reigns of Portugal attend high ma&s;s on gala days, is extremely magnificent and &s;uperb. I was pre&s;ent (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) at a grand gala, in&s;tituted to comme|morate the narrow e&s;cape of the late king, who had very near been treacherou&s;ly murdered by the duke <HI>Aveiros,</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates. Two coaches full of prie&s;ts, led the proce&s;&s;ion. Fifty of the patriarch's &s;ervants, two and two, came next, dre&s;&s;ed in blue liveries, trimmed with crim&s;on &s;ilk lace, all unco|vered, their hair well powdered, and wearing large cloaks reaching to the ground. Then followed &s;even carriages, belonging to his excellence. The two fir&s;t were occupied by his eminence's eccle&s;ia&s;|tical officers. In the third, was the Patriarch him|&s;elf. Excepting the Pope, there is no eccle&s;ia&s;tic in the whole world, &s;urrounded with &s;o much pomp, as the patriarch of Portugal. Two prie&s;ts walked by the &s;ide of his carriage, each carrying in their hands an umbrella, fringed with gold. The patri|arch's coach was lined both within and without with blue velvet, and gilt and painted with great ta&s;te and elegance. His &s;tate carriage followed after, &s;o very rich and fine (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) that queen <HI>Semiramis</HI> would not have thought it unworthy of her. The three other coaches were likewi&s;e filled with his attendants. Each of the four fir&s;t were drawn by &s;ix pied hor&s;es; that is, hor&s;es &s;treaked with black and white, which are not &s;o uncommon in Portugal,
<PB N="407" REF="412">
as they are in other countries. They all galloped, but their galloping was &s;o clo&s;e and &s;hort, that the attendants on foot could keep up with it, though they walked with great &s;lowne&s;s and &s;olemnity. The three next carriages, had each &s;ix very fine mules. The patriarch was dre&s;&s;ed in his pontificate.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this noble proce&s;&s;ion was advancing to|wards the cathedral, 20 other carriages, each drawn by &s;ix mules, made their appearance, filled with the dignitaries of the Li&s;bon cathedral.</P>
<P>The King then came in a coach and &s;ix, the hor&s;es black and white, like the patriarch's, &s;urrounded with his body guards. The queen followed imme|diately after, with her daughters, all in one coach, with four more coaches, each drawn by &s;ix hor&s;es. Her maje&s;ty was &s;urrounded by a troop of her own hor&s;e guards. She and the prince&s;&s;es were mo&s;t magnificently dre&s;&s;ed, wearing very large hoops, their heads, necks, brea&s;ts, arms, wai&s;ts, and feet, glittering with jewels.</P>
<P>In the pew, they all knelt, except the queen, who &s;at down, and began to read and ki&s;s the leaves of her book. As &s;he did this repeatedly every in&s;tant, I a&s;ked the meaning of it (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) and was told, that her maje&s;ty always ki&s;&s;ed the name of <HI>God,</HI> the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and all &s;aints and angels in every book &s;he read: a cu&s;tom, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that of
<PB N="408" REF="413">
Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> who u&s;ed always to bow, when the name of <HI>God</HI> was mentioned.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they entered the church, the pa|triarch quitting his throne, went to the altar, and ce|lebrated a high ma&s;s, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his dignitaries and canons, with the ceremonies ob&s;erved by the cardi|nals to the pope, when his holine&s;s officiates in the mo&s;t &s;olemn functions. During the ma&s;s, the royal band played and &s;ung mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly. The ceremo|ny la&s;ted a full hour, and was followed by the patri|archial benediction; after which, the company broke up, and went home, tired and fatigued with the ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat, which, as the &s;un &s;hone very bright, was quite intolerable.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the cathedral, was a batal|lion of foot guards, who were not allowed to fire upon this occa&s;ion, as is the cu&s;tom in &s;ome other catholic countries, le&s;t the hor&s;es and mules might be frightened, and trample upon the people. I was al&s;o much plea&s;ed (adds <HI>Baretti</HI>) to hear &s;everal of the officers repeatedly order the hor&s;eguards to keep clo&s;e together, and ride gently that no per&s;on might be hurt. This is a degree of attention in the mili|tary of Portugal, which travellers will not find in all countries, and as connected with the government, ought to be put in counterpoi&s;e to the calumnies heaped upon the whole nation by <HI>Co&s;tigan</HI> in his letters.</P>
