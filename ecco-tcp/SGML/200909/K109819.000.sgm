<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am &s;en&s;ible that this Performance will come into the World much more imperfect than I at fir&s;t thought it would. But I have la|bour'd under &s;o many Difficulties in the compiling of it, that when but a few of them are mentioned, I hope for a candid and favourable Judgment.</P>
<P>AFTER I had collected in private what Materials I could, I was then obliged to go publickly in Que&s;t of more. Upon this I publi&s;h'd an <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> de&s;iring the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch as had ancient Writings, or Deeds, or any other Things that might contribute to the helping of the Work.</P>
<P>THIS immediately, occa&s;ioned the following Reflecti|ons, that it might be of dangerous Con&s;equence to &s;hew ancient Writings, that He was but a Curate that under|took the Work, that his Abilities therefore of Pocket and
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
Mind mu&s;t be va&s;tly unequal to &s;uch a Task; in &s;hort, above 12 Months before the Publication of it, &s;ome have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s, (&s;o great has been their Ill-nature and Prejudice) as to take all Ways and Methods of decry|ing it; by Print, by Manu&s;cript, le&s;&s;ening it in all Com|panies to hinder it's Publication, and &s;peaking as freely of of it, as if they were acquainted with every Line of it's Compo&s;ition, and by a Prophetick Spirit knew it to be as they talk'd of it.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e Means I am certain I have been hindred of many Materials.</P>
<P>BUT there are two grand Di&s;appointments I met with in the Compiling of this Performance, which mu&s;t not be untaken Notice of. The One is my not being &s;o happy as to &s;ee Dr. <HI>Elli&s;on</HI>'s Collection of the Antiquities of this Town. A few indeed were &s;ent me, but having the &s;ame Copy from Mr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> they were of no Service; and excepting the&s;e I &s;aw no more. 'Tis to be hoped, as the Dr. mu&s;t have made a large Collection, having been about it, as is &s;aid, for many Years; that the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them will oblige the Town with the Publication of Them, and cure the Imperfections of the pre&s;ent Performance.</P>
<P>THE other Di&s;appointment is the not Meeting with tho&s;e large Collections of Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> taken No|tice of by Bi&s;hop <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> in his <HI>Engli&s;h Hi&s;torical Library.</HI> I endeavoured after a Sight of them, but they were then either lo&s;t, or &s;o mi&s;laid, that there was no coming at them.</P>
<P>AND if I add to all this, an Illne&s;s of many Months, and which it plea&s;es God &s;till to continue, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author did live but few Months after he wrote this Preface, dying <HI>Feb. 16. 1732.</HI></NOTE> which too fre|quently obliges me to tru&s;t the Copies of others, and de|pend upon them, I hope a few Errours and Failings will fall gently to my Share.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">HOWEVER in the mid&s;t of all this Malice and Ill-nature and the&s;e Di&s;appointments, there were &s;ome &s;o communicative, and generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ting, as to give all the Help they could. They are the Gentlemen following.</P>

<ITEM>CHRSTOPHER HUNTER of <HI>Durham,</HI> M. D. who has obliged me in the kinde&s;t Manner, with &s;everal curious Manu&s;cripts which are acknowledged in their proper Pla|ces.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Rev. Mr. SMITH of <HI>Mel&s;onby,</HI> who &s;ent me a Book of antient Deeds and Charters copy'd from one in <HI>&V;niver|&s;ity College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> relating to &s;ome Lands in this Town.</ITEM>
<ITEM>JOHN THORNTON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Nether-witton,</HI> who o|bliged me with a Sight of &s;ome ancient Writings, parti|cularly the Will of his famous Ance&s;tor <HI>Roger de Thornton.</HI></ITEM>

<HEAD>THE Ancient <HI>and</HI> Pre&s;ent STATE OF <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Some Account of the Roman Walls in the Country of the <HI>OTTADINI;</HI> particularly the Walls of <HI>HADRIAN</HI> and <HI>SEVERUS,</HI> which went through this TOWN. The mo&s;t ancient Name of this TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was about an hundred Years after the Landing of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in <HI>this I&s;land,</HI> when the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> a popu|lous and warlike Nation of the <HI>Britains,</HI> who&s;e Coun|try extended from the North of <HI>Humber</HI> to the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> containing the pre&s;ent Counties of <HI>York&s;hire, Dur|ham, Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> were fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Britains</HI> behaved them&s;elves in the War with great Courage and Re&s;o|lution, 'till at la&s;t, in the Reign of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> the great|e&s;t Part of them were conquered. After this in the Reign of <HI>Titus, Julius A|gricola,</HI> the Lieutenant of <HI>Britain,</HI> who was at lea&s;t equally Famous for his Conque&s;ts over the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the <HI>Britains,</HI> as for his many Victories over them in Battle, did in the third Year of his Lieutenancy make a Di&s;covery of other Parts of this I&s;land, which were not brought under the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke. Upon which he marched Northward into the Country of the <HI>Ottadini,</HI> which extends from the North of <HI>Tyne</HI> to the River <HI>Taus,</HI> wa|&s;ting and de&s;troying all before him, 'till he came to the <HI>Tay</HI> it &s;elf. And now according to &s;ome was the fir&s;t Wall made in <HI>Britain:</HI> But it was not pro|perly
<PB N="2" REF="13">
a Wall, it was only a Line of Garri&s;ons placed upon that Slip of Land between <HI>Edinburgh-Frith</HI> and <HI>Dun-Britain-Frith,</HI> for the Security of what they had already gain'd; and if the Valour of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Army, and the Renown of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name could have &s;uffer'd it, there was no Need of a further Search after the Bounds and Limits of <HI>Britain.</HI> The <HI>Friths</HI> above-mentioned, called then <HI>Glota</HI> and <HI>Bodotria,</HI> might have been very &s;ufficient, being the Arms of two oppo&s;ite Seas, and only &s;eparated by a &s;mall Space of Land, which was well fortified with the <HI>Roman</HI> Garri&s;ons; &s;o that the <HI>Romans</HI> were Lords of the whole South, and had ca&s;t the Enemy as it were into another I&s;land <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Tacit. in vit. Agricol.</NOTE>. But what could ever bound the Roman Glory, and limit their ne|ver &s;atisfied Ambition? It was not enough that they had intirely &s;ecured them|&s;elves for any Attempts of the <HI>Caledonians,</HI> but <HI>They</HI> al&s;o were to be &s;ubdued. This was effected in the 8th Year of <HI>Agricola</HI>'s Lieutenancy in the reign of <HI>Domitian.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER after this, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> that further Part of the I&s;land was left to the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">The inha|bitants went naked, had no Hou&s;es to live in, nei|ther did they Till the Ground. As one writeth, <HI>de praeda &amp; venatione, Frondibu&s;&abque; Arborum vi|vant, degent in Tentoriis Nudi &amp; &s;ine calceis.</HI> Grey ex Xiphilin'.</NOTE> <HI>Barbarians,</HI> as neither Plea&s;ant nor Fruitful; but this nether Part was fairly reduc'd to a <HI>Roman</HI> Province; which was not governed by Con&s;ular, or Pro|con&s;ular Deputies; but was counted Prae&s;idial, and appropriate to the <HI>Cae|&s;ars,</HI> as being a Province annex'd to the Empire, after the Divi&s;ion of Pro|vinces made by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and having <HI>Propraetors</HI> of its own.</P>
<P><HI>HADRIAN,</HI> who was made Emperor about the Year of our Lord 117, made the &s;econd Wall. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> He drew a Wall, &s;ays <HI>Spartian,</HI> of eighty Miles in Length, to divide the Barbarians from the <HI>Romans;</HI> which one may gather, from what follows in <HI>Spartian,</HI> to have been in the Fa&s;hion of a <HI>Mural Hedge</HI> of large Stakes, fix'd deep in the Ground, and fa&s;tned together with Wattles. The &s;ame Authority from the Scotch Hi&s;torian who wrote the <HI>Rota Temporum,</HI> tells us, that <HI>Hadrian</HI> did fir&s;t of all draw a Wall of a prodigious Bigne&s;s, made of Turf (of that Height that it look'd like a Mountain, and with a deep Ditch before it) From the Mouth of the <HI>Tyne</HI> to the River <HI>Eske,</HI> i. e. from the <HI>German</HI> to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ocean. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been done about the Year 123.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Third Wall was built by <HI>Lollius Urbicus,</HI> Lieutenant of Britain, un|der <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> about the Year 144, who by his great Succe&s;s removed back the Bounds to where <HI>Julius Agricola</HI> had &s;et them, and rai&s;ed a Wall there.</P>
<P>THE <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Fourth Wall was that of <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">This Empe|ror died at <HI>York</HI> about the Year <HI>211,</HI> Feb. 4th.</NOTE> <HI>Severus,</HI> which was built about the Year of Chri&s;t 210, which extended from Sea to Sea, quite cro&s;s the I&s;land. This was a Wall of Stone, built much about the &s;ame Place where the Wall of <HI>Hadrian</HI> was. It had it's Beginning at <HI>Bulne&s;s</HI> on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, and cro&s;&s;ing the I&s;land, went as far as <HI>Walls-End,</HI> a Village about 3 Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>A <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> Fifth Wall was built between the two Arms or Bo&s;oms of the Seas for many Miles together, that where the Waters did not defend them, the Wall might be a Security again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the Enemy. This Wall was made by <HI>Carau&s;ius,</HI> Governour of <HI>Britain,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> and &s;tood in the &s;ame Place where <HI>Lollius Urbicus</HI> had built his.</P>
<P>THIS being fini&s;hed, the <HI>Romans</HI> left the <HI>Britains</HI> to their own Valour and Conduct, being called away for the Defence of <HI>Gaul;</HI> But no &s;ooner were they gone, than their Enemies returned, and &s;lew all before them: Up|on this they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;ollicite the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> which was granted them. For <HI>Valentinian</HI> &s;ent three Companies under the Conduct of <HI>Gallio</HI> of <HI>Ravenua,</HI> who routed the Enemy and relieved the Province. After this <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Cambd. p. 86. <HI>ex Gild'.</HI></NOTE> they made a Wall of Stone (not rai&s;ed at the pub|lick and private Co&s;ts, as the other was) with the Help of the poor Natives, built after the u&s;ual Manner, quite cro&s;s the Country from one Sea to ano|ther, by tho&s;e Cities which were perhaps built there for fear of the Enemy: They exhorted them to be couragious, and left them Patterns to make their Weapons by. Upon the Southren Shore of <HI>Britain</HI> al&s;o, where their Ships
<PB N="3" REF="14">
lay, (becau&s;e the barbarous Enemy might enter there) they built <HI>Turrets</HI> at &s;ome Di&s;tance from one another, that lookt a long Way to the Sea. And &s;o the <HI>Romans</HI> intending never to return more, about the Four Hundred Seventy Sixth Year from the coming of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> took their la&s;t Farewell.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t Wall, according to <HI>Bede,</HI> was eight Foot broad and twelve Foot high, and &s;tood in the Place where the Walls of <HI>Hadrian</HI> and <HI>Severus</HI> had &s;tood. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Cambd.</NOTE> It had great Number of Towers or little <HI>Ca&s;tles,</HI> a Mile one from another, called now <HI>Ca&s;tle&s;teeds;</HI> and on the In&s;ide a Sort of <HI>fortified little Towns</HI> call'd <HI>Che&s;ters.</HI> The Inhabitants tell you there was al&s;o a <HI>Brazen Trum|pet</HI> or <HI>Pipe,</HI> (whereof they now and then find Pieces) &s;o artificially laid in the Wall between each <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> and Tower, that upon the Apprehen&s;ion of Dan|ger at any &s;ingle Place, by the &s;ounding of it, Notice might be given to the next, then to the Third, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>THESE are all the Walls of the <HI>Romans;</HI> and that three of them went through this Town is &s;omething more than probable. For <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall was in the Place of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s, and the la&s;t Wall mentioned, in the Place of <HI>Severus</HI>'s, and that la&s;t Wall went through this Town. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is &s;o &s;ure of this, that he declares, <HI>'Tis mo&s;t certain that the Rampier, and afterward the Wall pa&s;&s;ed through this Town; and that at</HI> Pandon-Gate <HI>there &s;till remains, as 'tis Thought, one of the little</HI> Turrets <HI>of that very Wall.</HI> There is indeed to this very Day a Part of that <HI>Turret</HI> in being, above <HI>Pandon-Gate,</HI> which, as the &s;ame Authority ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, is different from the Re&s;t both in Fa&s;hon and Ma&s;onry, and undoubtedly carrys along with it a very great Age.</P>
<P>NEAR this <HI>Turret</HI> is the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> a very ancient Place, which our Hi|&s;torian <HI>Grey</HI> &s;ays po&s;itively, <HI>Was a Part of the Picts-Wall;</HI> and indeed the very Name of it &s;peaks as much. For the Word <HI>Wall</HI> upon the <HI>Knoll,</HI> which &s;ignifies an <HI>Hill</HI> or <HI>Eminence,</HI> cannot be under&s;tood of any other than the <HI>Ro|man-Wall;</HI> Becau&s;e it had this Name from very ancient Times, long before the Building of the <HI>Town-Wall,</HI> to which it almo&s;t adjoins.</P>
<P>A little above this Place is a <HI>Tower,</HI> commonly call'd the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Wall-knoll Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Carpenters-Tower.</HI> This was one of the <HI>Roman-Towers,</HI> as was very Vi&s;ible, before the taking down of the Upper-part of it. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Lib. de rebus Novo|ca&s;t'.</NOTE> For it was of the &s;ame Size, Model, and Stone with the Tower of <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">This Village is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>John Ro|gers,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who has tur|ned the inner Part of the Tower into Modern Rooms, but left the Walls of it &s;till intire.</NOTE> <HI>Rutche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which was undoub|tedly one of the <HI>Roman Towers,</HI> by the <HI>Picts-Wall.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t al&s;o not be omitted, that there is an ancient Tradition among the Inhabitants of this Town, that the <HI>Roman-Wall</HI> went through the <HI>We&s;t-Gate,</HI> and the <HI>Vicar's Garden,</HI> along that Ground where St. <HI>Nicholas-Church</HI> now &s;tands, along <HI>Nether-Dean-Bridge,</HI> by the <HI>Wall-Knoll, Sally-Port,</HI> and &s;o on to <HI>Walls-End.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to the&s;e Rea&s;ons and Authorities let us add what <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Hollin&s;. De|&s;crip. of <HI>Brit. p. 128.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hollin&s;head</HI> &s;ays, where he gives an Account of the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Roman-Wall.</HI> It begins he &s;ays at <HI>Bolne&s;s upon Burgh,</HI> and &s;o he brings it from Place to Place, 'till he brings it to <HI>Rutche&s;ter,</HI> then to <HI>Heddon,</HI> then to <HI>Wallbottle,</HI> then to <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">A &s;mall Vil|lage about <HI>3</HI> Miles <HI>We&s;t</HI> from <HI>Newca|&s;tle,</HI> belonging to <HI>John Ro|gers, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></NOTE> <HI>Denton,</HI> and to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where it is thought St. <HI>Nicholas Church &s;tandeth</HI> on the &s;ame.</P>
<P>TO this I &s;hall add the Authority of a Manu&s;cript, I am obliged to a very worthy <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">John-Mil|bank, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></NOTE> Gentleman for; <HI>Hadrian</HI> built a Wall of Turff or Sods, from the Sea-Side beyond <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> unto <HI>Tinmouth.</HI> It was demoli&s;hed after he was gone, and after him <HI>Severus</HI> built near the &s;ame a Wall of Stone, and made Towers and Watching Places at every Miles End, and a Pa&s;&s;age all along by the Help of an <HI>Horn,</HI> or &s;uch an In&s;trument, that they might &s;peak through the Wall, and tell where the Enemy was. This ended at the River of <HI>Tyne</HI> near <HI>Walls-End.</HI> This Authority goes on, I my &s;elf have &s;een it at <HI>Thirlwall,</HI> and it cometh by <HI>Portgate,</HI> near <HI>Stanchebank,</HI> by <HI>Halton,</HI> near the <HI>Long-Lane,</HI> where both the <HI>Walls</HI> are Apparent; as al&s;o at <HI>Denton,</HI> over <HI>Bonwell-Hill,</HI> down to

It is therefore not pre&s;uma|ble that the <HI>Romans</HI> would have begun or end|ed the Wall but at the Side of the &s;aid River, &s;eeing all to the Ea&s;t|ward of this Place, the Ri|ver was the Continuation of the <HI>Prae|tentura</HI> or Fence, from hindring the northerly In|cur&s;ions. The fir&s;t Track is half a Mile South from <HI>Wall&s;end,</HI> near <HI>Cou|&s;ins</HI>'s Hou&s;e, beginning a little to the Ea&s;t of it, at the Side of the River <HI>Tyne;</HI> and here certainly the 1&s;t Station of <HI>Segedunum</HI> was originally placed. For <HI>162</HI> Paces a &s;aint Track of the Wall appears running North twelve Degrees and a half We&s;terly; then forms an Angle, Pointing &s;outh we&s;terly for <HI>135</HI> Paces to the above|mention'd Man&s;ion of <HI>Cou&s;ins</HI>'s Hou&s;e. About <HI>131</HI> Paces We&s;t of this, the <HI>Fo&s;&s;a</HI> begins to appear pretty di&s;tinct, mea&s;uring about <HI>20</HI> Foot in Breadth, and a little beyond it, is the Foundation of the Stone Wall, from hence it pa&s;&s;es by a few Hou&s;es called the Bee-Hou&s;es, next through a &s;mall Village called <HI>Walker:</HI> Here the <HI>Fo&s;ta</HI> is <HI>40</HI> Foot broad, beyond which the Foundation of the <HI>Stone-Wall</HI> appears plain, then it a&s;cends the <HI>Byker-Hill,</HI> run|ing betwixt the Village of <HI>Byker</HI> and the Windmill, thence going down the Hill, pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Euesburn,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing the Rivulet there; then I found it a&s;cend the high Ground to the We&s;tward of it, pa&s;&s;ing by the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e and through the Garden to the <HI>Red-Barnes;</HI> from thence it is vi&s;ible through the Fields, going Streight to the <HI>Sally-Port Gate</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle.

<P>THUS I think it very clear that the&s;e <HI>Roman-Walls</HI> went through this Town. Let us now &s;ee what this Town was in the&s;e ancient Times. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">p. 779</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> gives his Opinion thus: <HI>Gate&s;ide</HI> is commonly believed to be of grea|ter Antiquity than <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> it &s;elf. And if I &s;hould &s;ay further, that this and <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> (for they &s;eem formerly to have been only one Town parted by the River) were that Frontier-Garri&s;on, which in the Times of the later Emperors was called <HI>Gabro&s;entum,</HI> and defended by the <HI>&s;econd Cohort of</HI> the <HI>Thraces;</HI> and that it retained it's old Name in a due Sen&s;e and Signification, notwith&s;tanding <HI>this Newca&s;tle</HI> has changed it's Name once or twice, I hope it will be no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth. For <HI>Gaffr</HI> is u&s;ed by the <HI>Britains</HI> for a <HI>Goat,</HI> and <HI>Hen,</HI> in Compo&s;ition for <HI>Pen,</HI> which &s;ignifies an <HI>Head:</HI> And in this very Sen&s;e and Meaning it is plainly called <HI>Caprae Caput,</HI> or <HI>Goats-Head</HI> by our old Latin Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>THUS far this learned Antiquary. But notwith&s;tanding this his Judgment, and that no tollerable Rea&s;on can be brought again&s;t the two Places having been but one; yet &s;ome will &s;till have it, that <HI>Gate&s;ide,</HI> exclu&s;ive of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> is the ancient <HI>Gabro&s;entum,</HI> becau&s;e of it's Name. For my Part I cannot help being of Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI>'s Opinion, and for this, among other Rea&s;ons; that if the Name of <HI>Caprae Caput</HI> di&s;covers the <HI>Gabro&s;entum,</HI> then it is more probable that the principal Part of it lay on the North-&s;ide of the River than on the South: Becau&s;e <HI>Gabro&s;entum</HI> was one of the&s;e <HI>Frontier Garri&s;ons,</HI> which lay <HI>ad Lineam Valli,</HI> within the very Range of the Wall. For all the&s;e Garri&s;ons <HI>ad Lineam Valli,</HI> were placed on the &s;ame Side of the River with the Wall it &s;elf, con&s;equently <HI>Gate&s;ide</HI> could but at mo&s;t have been a Part of <HI>Gabro&s;entum,</HI> and the meane&s;t Part of it too; a Sort of Suburbs to it, as it actually was to this Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward the Sixth,</HI> as &s;hall be &s;hown hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT if this is not allowed, (and yet it mu&s;t be allowed, if <HI>Gate&s;ide</HI> has it's Name from the <HI>Gabro&s;entum</HI>) yet mo&s;t certainly it was a <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Chap.</HI> of the upper Parts of the Town.</NOTE> <HI>garri&s;on'd Fort</HI> in the&s;e very Times. For &s;till there is the Remains of a <HI>Roman Turret,</HI> and the under Part of one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Towers to be &s;een, and the Name of <HI>Pandon</HI> is no &s;mall Corroboration of the Truth of it, as may be &s;een in our Account of that Place.</P>
<P>THUS I think whatever is boa&s;ted of the Antiquity of <HI>Gate&s;ide,</HI> it plainly appears, that if <HI>Caprae Caput,</HI> or <HI>Gate&s;ide</HI> Points out the ancient <HI>Gabro&s;entum, Newca&s;tle</HI> mu&s;t be her elder Si&s;ter; fora&s;much as a Town mu&s;t be earlier than it's Suburbs. And if it does not <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> is by Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> called the old <HI>Gabrocentum</HI> where the 2d Cohort of the <HI>Thracians</HI> lay; but according to the Cour&s;e of the Forts in the <HI>Notitia Imperii, Gabrocentum</HI> is the &s;eventeenth Station on the Wall; if therefore we follow the <HI>Noticia</HI> &s;trictly, <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> would rather &s;eem to be the <HI>Pons-Aelii,</HI> the 2d Station on the Wall, where the <HI>Cohort</HI> of the <HI>Cornovii</HI> lay. In this I have the concurring Opinion of the learned and judicious Antiquary Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> of <HI>Durham. Gord. Itin. Septent. pag.</HI> 71. The ancient <HI>Orrhea,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> has been thought by &s;ome to have been the Original of this Town, but for what Rea&s;on I know not.</P></NOTE> Point it out, it will then be a certain Con|clu&s;ion, that there is an indi&s;putable Account of <HI>this Town</HI> in the&s;e very Times of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which was &s;ome Hundreds of Years before <HI>Caprae Ca|put,</HI> or <HI>Gate&s;ide</HI> is mentioned by the mo&s;t early of our Latin Hi&s;torians.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of this TOWN, after the Time of the <HI>ROMANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AFTER the Departure of the <HI>Romans,</HI> it &s;eems to have chan|ged it's Name, as I &s;hall &s;hew immediately; and probably by the latter Part of it's after Name <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> it was a Place of Defence, or <HI>Garri&s;on'd Fort,</HI> during the Times of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI> This Name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> it retain|ed 'till after the Conque&s;t. Thus we are told from <HI>Simeon Dunelmen&s;is,</HI> a Monk of the Church of <HI>Durham,</HI> that <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> was anciently called <HI>Monkche&s;ter, civitas Monachorum,</HI> or the Town of the Monks, not becau&s;e it belong'd to the Monks, but becau&s;e the Monks of tho&s;e Parts dwelt there.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ex Collect. Mr. <HI>J. Dou|glas.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>SOME, are of Opinion, that <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> got it's Name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> becau&s;e the Monks in Time of Danger came for Protection to it, and not from their inhabiting it. This is quite contrary to the Authority above-mentioned, and all others that I have met with. Mr. <HI>Eachard</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>England</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> was &s;o called from certain Monks who <HI>lived there</HI> in great
<PB N="6" REF="17">
Au&s;terity and Retirement; and the <HI>Mona&s;ticon</HI> gives us the following Account. In the Year 1074, there was a certain Man in the Province of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> a Presbyter and Prior of the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Winchele&s;cumbe,</HI> who was a Monk, who&s;e Name was <HI>Aldwin:</HI> This Man preferr'd a voluntary Poverty and Con|tempt of the World to all it's Honours and Riches; and having learned from the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> that that Land was formerly famous for Mul|titudes of Monks and religious Men, who tho' in the Fle&s;h, lived not accor|ding to the Fle&s;h, but whil&s;t they were on Earth, had their Conver&s;ation in Heaven: He de&s;ired greatly to vi&s;it the Mona&s;teries of the&s;e Places, (tho' He knew they were for&s;aken and left de&s;olate) and there to lead a poor Life in Imitation of them. Coming therefore as far as the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> he made known his Purpo&s;e to certain of the Brethren; upon which, two of them a&s;&s;ociated with him; one of them was named <HI>Elfwie,</HI> who was a Dea|con, and after that a Prie&s;t; The other's Name was <HI>Renifrid;</HI> he was igno|rant of Letters. The&s;e the <HI>Abbot</HI> gave leave to accompany him, but not 'till he had &s;et <HI>Aldwin</HI> over them, and committed to him the Care of their Souls. After this, they &s;et forward on their Journey a Foot, having an A&s;s to carry their Books, Nece&s;&s;aries, and their Sacerdotal Ve&s;tments, to celebrate divine Service in. At length they came to <HI>York,</HI> de&s;iring of <HI>Hugh,</HI> the Son of <HI>Bal|drick,</HI> who was then Sheriff, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><P>Ut eis du|cem itineris inveniret u&s;|que locum qui Monkce|&s;ter, i. e.

Walcher</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> hearing of this, &s;ent for them, and gave them the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Jarray,</HI> which at that Time was unroof'd, and had &s;carce any Thing remaining of it's ancient Grandeur.</P>
<P>AND now how long it had been in this de&s;olate Condition we may gather from <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mag. Brit. Nov. &amp; An|tiq. ex <HI>Hol|biu&s;.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Holling&s;head.</HI> By the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> &s;ays he, the Churches and Mona&s;teries throughout <HI>Northumberland</HI> were &s;o wai&s;ted and ruined, that a Man could &s;carcely find a Church &s;tanding at this Time in all that Country; and as for tho&s;e that remained, they were all covered with Broom or Thatch: And as for any <HI>Abby</HI> or <HI>Mona&s;tery</HI> there was not one left in all the Country; neither did any Man, for the Space of <HI>Two hundred Years,</HI> take Care for the repairing or building up of any Thing in Decay; &s;o that the People of this County knew not what a Monk meant. And if they &s;aw any, they wonder|ed at the Strangene&s;s of the Sight. One Place there was in this County, fa|mous for being the Habitation of Monks, from whence it was called <HI>Monk|che&s;ter,</HI> but that al&s;o was &s;o ruinated and de&s;troy'd, that when the Monks of <HI>Mercia</HI> (the Monks mentioned before) came to it, they found no Token or Remnant of any Religions Per&s;ons who had had an Habitation there; all was defaced and gone.</P>
<P>NOW with re&s;pect to <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> this &s;eems to be punctually true. For as <HI>Holling&s;head</HI> ob&s;erves that it was about 200 Years from the Ruin of the Mo|na&s;teries to this Time after the Conque&s;t <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Anno 1074</NOTE>; &s;o it mu&s;t be taken Notice of, that the <HI>Danes,</HI> in the Year <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hollin.</NOTE> 875, which was the 4th of the Reign of King <HI>Alured,</HI> divided them&s;elves. So that King <HI>Haldon</HI> with one Part there|of went into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and lay in the Winter Sea&s;on near <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">He &s;at down with his Men at <HI>Tames|mouth,</HI> which is be|tween <HI>Gate|&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Whickham. Sim. Dunel'.</HI></NOTE> to the River of <HI>Tyne,</HI> where he divided the Country among&s;t his Men, and remained there for the Space of two Years, and oftentimes fetched thither Booties and Preys out of the Country of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears then from this, that the Mona&s;teries of <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> had been in Ruins about 200 Years, that is to &s;ay, from the Year 875 to the Year 1074, the Time of the Coming of the <HI>Mercian</HI> Monk.</P>
<P>LET us now &s;ee if we can form any probable Conjecture when it was fir&s;t inhabited by <HI>Monks,</HI> and got the Name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter.</HI> And this I imagine happen'd towards the later End of the 7th Century. For in the Year 635, the Mona&s;tical Life was brought in among the <HI>Northumbers</HI> by <HI>Aidan,</HI> who was

<P>After this, the See of <HI>Hexam,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Wars, lay neglected for above <HI>63</HI> years together.

flouri&s;hed in this whole Kingdom. This Account <HI>Holling&s;head</HI> gives in the following Words: Great Numbers of Per&s;ons daily offered them&s;elves to be baptized, in&s;omuch that within the Space of 7 Days (as is left in Writing) <HI>Aidan</HI> chri&s;tned 15 Thou&s;and Per&s;ons, of the which no &s;mall Part for&s;aking the World, betook them&s;elves to a Solitary kind of Life. Thus by continual Preaching the Go&s;pel in that Country, it came to pa&s;s in the End, that the Faith was generally received of all the People; and &s;uch Zeal to advance the Chri&s;tian Religion daily increa&s;ed among&s;t them, that no where could be found greater. Hereupon were no &s;mall Number of Churches built in all Pla|ces abroad in tho&s;e Parts by Procurement of King <HI>O&s;wold,</HI> all Men liberally con&s;enting (according to the rated Sub&s;tance) to be Contributors towards the Charges. By this Means the Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers</HI> flouri&s;h'd, as well in Fame of Increa&s;e of Religion, as al&s;o in civil Policy and prudent Ordinances.</P>
<P>When now it is con&s;idered that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion went on &s;o Brisk|ly throughout the whole Kingdom of the <HI>Northumbers;</HI> it is rational to &s;up|po&s;e that this Place, as it was not only convenient for the mona&s;tical Life as to Retirement, but al&s;o a Security to it too, (being at that Time a garri&s;on'd Fort) was certainly as early inhabited by the Monks as the abovementioned Time; and be&s;ides if we con&s;ider the Veneration it is mention'd with by many Hi&s;torians for the &s;evere rigid Lives of it's Monks; how it was the mo&s;t emi|nent Place in the North, for the mona&s;tical Life, &s;o very famous on that ac|count, as to change it's former Name to that of <HI>Monkche&s;ter:</HI> There can &s;carce be allowed it a later Time to arrive at &s;uch a Pitch of Eminency and Glory. Before the Name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> I imagine, from it's being a Place of For|tification, that it had the Name of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as <HI>Weremuth</HI> was the original Name of that Place, but was afterwards called <HI>Monkweremuth,</HI> from the Monks inha|biting there. It &s;eems all along to have been a Place of Defence and Fortifi|cation. It was the Ancient <HI>Gabro&s;entum,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Cambden;</HI> or as o|thers more ju&s;tly imagine the <HI>Pons Aelii</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> was a garri&s;on'd Fort, 'till inhabited by the Monks; and was &s;uch from the Time of the Monks 'till the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> continued 'till the Building of the Ca&s;tle, and after that, from the Building of it, it got the Name of <HI>New-ca&s;tle:</HI> The Oc|ca&s;ion of which was this. <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> having entred with his Army into the Confines of <HI>England,</HI> came with it into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and wai&s;ted and plundered the whole Country as far as the River <HI>Tyne;</HI> the Con|queror being all the while in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and al&s;o his Son <HI>Robert Curtois.</HI> But no &s;ooner were the King and his Son come into <HI>England,</HI> than <HI>Robert</HI> was &s;ent with an Army again&s;t <HI>Malcolme</HI> to drive him out of the Country. The <HI>Scots</HI> being appriz'd of this, retir'd into their own Country, and <HI>Robert</HI> with his Army encamp'd upon the Banks of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> where he built the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> to de|fend the&s;e Northern Parts from the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Scots,</HI> for the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mag.

<P>AFTER this the Town grew more populous, and increas'd in Trade and Wealth; had great Privileges granted them by the Kings, built Churches, Mona&s;teries, Walls, Bridges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as &s;hall be &s;een in the following Treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the <HI>WALLS</HI> of this TOWN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_NEW CASTLE</HI> is &s;eated on the Northern Bank of the Ri|ver <HI>Tyne;</HI> and is bounded on the Ea&s;t by the Land of <HI>By|ker;</HI> on the We&s;t by the Lands belonging formerly to the <HI>Prior of Tinemouth;</HI> on the North by the Lands of <HI>Kenton,</HI> and <HI>Coxlodge,</HI> and on the South by the County of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>IT is &s;urrounded with a <HI>Stone-Wall,</HI> which at the Time it was built, and for many Ages after, was undoubtedly of very great Strength. This has &s;everal Gates belonging to it, <HI>Round Towers,</HI> and <HI>Square Turrets,</HI> which &s;hall by and by be con&s;idered. On the Out-&s;ide of it is a Ditch or Trench, and on the In&s;ide it is ramper'd with Earth.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Grey.</NOTE>THE Cau&s;e of Building this great Wall was the often Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Scots</HI> into this Place and Country; they continually infe&s;ted it and the rich Mona&s;teries in the&s;e Northern Parts; the religious Hou&s;es of this Town, and the adiacent Places being above Forty.</P>
<P>SOME are of Opinion, that the Walls were begun in the Reign of <HI>King Henry the Third.</HI> But the Author ju&s;t now mentioned, imagines Them to have been earlier. King <HI>John,</HI> he &s;ays, gave great Priviledges to this Town, and probably the <HI>New-gate,</HI> and Walls thereabout, were built in his Time; the North Part of the Wall being the olde&s;t, and of another Fa&s;hion than the other Walls.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, the &s;ame Author &s;ays, the We&s;t part of the Wall was built; but I am rather inclined to believe, that that Part of the Wall was not built 'till the Reign of <HI>Edward the 1&s;t.</HI> The Wall from
<PB N="11" REF="22">
the Time it was begun, went on but &s;lowly 'till this Reign, when an Acci|dent hapned, which revived the former Fears of the Towns-Men, and put them in Mind of the neglected Wall, which, 'till that Time had got no far|ther than <HI>Ever-Tower,</HI> as appears by the old Part of the Wall, ending there|abouts. The Accident was this, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cambden.</NOTE> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, a very <HI>rich Burgher</HI> being carried off a Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Scots,</HI> out of the Middle of the Town, fir&s;t paid a round Ran&s;om him&s;elf, and afterwards began the 1&s;t For|tifications of the Place.</P>
<P>IT is true, that this Accident was the Occa&s;ion of carrying on the Wall; but Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> is mi&s;taken in &s;aying it occa&s;ioned the Beginning of it. For it was begun &s;ome Years before the Reign of <HI>Edward the 1&s;t.</HI> For from <HI>New|gate</HI> to the <HI>Ever-Tower</HI> as has ju&s;t now been ob&s;erved, is a Work older, and va&s;tly different from what the Wall is from <HI>Ever-Tower</HI> towards the <HI>We&s;t-gate.</HI> This Wall, leading to the <HI>We&s;t-gate,</HI> was it which was begun in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, for in this Reign it was, (when Leave was granted to the preaching Friers to break out that <HI>Little Gate</HI> which now leads into the <HI>Wardens-Clo&s;e,</HI> then their Garden, that this Wall was called the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vid. Dur|ham-Tower <HI>and</HI> Black-Friers.</NOTE> <HI>New-Wall;</HI> and &s;urely a New-Wall, will imply that there was an Old one before, was the thing it&s;elf not &s;till a Matter of Fact as it really is to any Ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>HOW long the Walls were a Building, or who they were in particular that contributed towards the Building of them, is a Matter pretty much in the Dark. However, 'tis <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Gardiner, chap. 4.</HI></P>
<P>This Au|thor, who&s;e Name was <HI>Ralph Gar|diner,</HI> liv'd at <HI>Chirton,</HI> a Village Ea&s;t of <HI>Newca|&s;tle,</HI> near the Town of <HI>Shields,</HI> which Village is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Rob^t Law|&s;on</HI> and <HI>Ed|ward Col|lingwood.</HI> E&s;qrs. He was a bitter Enemy to this Town, and did all the Mi&s;chief to it that lay in his Power, as appears in every Page of his Book. In which are Numbers of Fal&s;ities.</P></NOTE> &s;uppo&s;ed, that King <HI>Edward the 1&s;t,</HI> was a Contri|butor to them. The Names of &s;ome of the Round-Towers al&s;o give us &s;ome Light, which to this Day do &s;eemingly bear the Names of their ancient Foun|ders, which may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure occa&s;ion a Gue&s;s at the Time of their Buil|ding.</P>
<P>THE Town, after the compleating of the Walls, was divided into 24 <HI>Wards,</HI> according to the Number of the Gates, and round Towers in the Wall, which Towers and Gates were wont be defended in Times of Ho&s;tili|ty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> by the particular Wards appropriated to them.</P>
<P>THE 1&s;t Gate I &s;hall begin with is the <HI>Clo&s;e-gate,</HI> which is &s;o called, be|cau&s;e it &s;tands in a narrow Street called the Clo&s;e, it had in Ward, from the <HI>Clo&s;e-gate</HI> upon the <HI>South-rawe,</HI> &s;o going Ea&s;tward unto the <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> but nothing of <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> then going We&s;tward upon the North unto the <HI>Clo&s;e-gate.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Clo&s;e-gate</HI> there are Stairs leading up to a <HI>Round-Tower</HI> called the <HI>White-Fryer-Tower.</HI> This Tower had in Ward, from the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Javil-grippe,</HI> with all that dwell upon the <HI>High-Stairs</HI> in the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> unto and with the We&s;t-&s;ide of the&s;e <HI>Stairs</HI> that lead unto the <HI>South-Po&s;tern</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> with all <HI>Javil-grippe</HI> Ea&s;tward, and from the <HI>Javil-grippe</HI> to the South-rawe of the Clo&s;e, and with all the <HI>Bridge-End.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tower, with the Wall leading to the <HI>little Gate,</HI> (commonly called the <HI>Po&s;tern-gate,</HI> but originally the Gate of the <HI>White-Fryers,</HI> or <HI>White-Fryer-gate</HI>) were together with the Gate it&s;elf, probably built by the <HI>White-Fryers;</HI> for the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were &s;ituated in the South-we&s;t-end of the Street of <HI>We&s;t-gate,</HI> in the &s;ame Grounds were are now the Hou&s;es of Mr. <HI>Ander&s;on, George Grey,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and others. And as it is rea&s;onable to believe, that what|ever <HI>Religious Hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Nobleman,</HI> built a Tower or Piece of the Wall, that it would be built chiefly for their own Security; &s;o the Buildings now mentioned, being &s;o &s;ituated as I have ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, are a Proof that the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were the Founders. And if it be con&s;idered that the <HI>White-Fryers</HI> were <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> White-Fryers.</NOTE> founded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, in who&s;e Reign the above-mentioned Accident happened, which occa&s;ioned a fre&s;h Beginning of Building of the Wall; it will appear &s;till more probable, that the&s;e <HI>Fryers</HI> were the Builders. It may indeed be &s;aid, that as they were &s;ounded in this
<PB N="12" REF="23">
Reign, it can't be imagin'd they had &s;ufficient Riches for &s;uch an Un|dertaking. This is readily granted, but when it is con&s;idered, that the&s;e <HI>Fry|ers</HI> were newly founded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, that they were the fir&s;t of that Order that had been in this Place, that they were <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or original|ly coming from Mount <HI>Carmel</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that the Prayers of all Mona&s;te|ries were thought more particularly available for the Souls in Purgatory; it will follow I think rationally, that they were more able <HI>then</HI> to do &s;uch a Thing by getting the Contributions of others, than they could have been of them&s;elves 200 Years after. The Name given to the&s;e Walls is al&s;o another Argument; it is more probable, that the <HI>White-Fryer-Tower,</HI> the <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Gate</HI> now mentioned, were &s;o called, (as other Towers were) from their Foun|ders, than from their bare Situation. For the Walls behind the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> are not called after their Name, becau&s;e they were not built by them, but by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, as &s;hall be &s;hewn below.</P>
<P>THIS Tower is now the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Hall</HI> of the Company of Ma|&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> in mentioning the Ports or Gates of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> &s;ays, there were be|&s;ides <HI>The&s;e, Po&s;tern-Gates</HI> belonging to the <HI>Religious Hou&s;es;</HI> I have met with no more than three, and this <HI>White-Friers-gate</HI> is undoubtedly one of them. It &s;eems to be much of the &s;ame Kind with that which leads into the <HI>Warden's-Clo&s;e.</HI> It has been an Out-let to the Fryers, that they might walk to the <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>neighbouring Fields;</HI> and that it might be of U&s;e and Service to the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> in Times of Ho&s;tility with the <HI>Scots.</HI> I imagine it was out at this Gate, that the <HI>Town&s;men</HI> made that famous Sally, mention'd by <HI>Grey,</HI> who &s;ays, that in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">See a more perfect Ac|count in the Year of the Mayors, <HI>1342.</HI></NOTE> Three hundred valiant Men i&s;&s;ued out of the Town through a <HI>Po&s;tern-gate,</HI> and came &s;uddenly in the Night up|on a great Army of the <HI>Scots,</HI> which lay in the We&s;t Part of the Town, and rai&s;ed the Army, put them to flight, and took Earl <HI>Murray</HI> Pri&s;oner in his Tent, and others.</P>
<P>THE next Round Tower to <HI>White-Fryer-gate</HI> is <HI>Denton-Tower,</HI> or <HI>Nevil-Tower,</HI> which had in Ward all the <HI>Hairy-Hugh,</HI> on the South Side of the <HI>White-Fryers,</HI> with all the Hou&s;es &s;tanding there, upon the <HI>Burn-bank,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Fryer-Kirk,</HI> and a Burne, unto the Stone Bridge in <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> with all <HI>Bailiff-gate,</HI> upward that &s;ame Rawe unto <HI>Denton-Chare,</HI> with <HI>Denton-Chare.</HI></P>
<P>WHY it was called <HI>Denton-Tower,</HI> I can give no Rea&s;on, unle&s;s it was from it's having in Ward the Lane called <HI>Denton-Chare;</HI> but it has the Name of <HI>Nevil-Tower,</HI> from the <HI>Nevil</HI> Family of <HI>Raby</HI> who built it, which Family was honoured with the Title of <HI>Earl</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d, <HI>Ralph Nevil</HI> Lord of <HI>Raby,</HI> being created <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> in the 21&s;t of that Reign: His Hou&s;e in <HI>We&s;t-gate,</HI> called <HI>We&s;tmoreland-place,</HI> which &s;hall be con|&s;idered when we treat of that Street, had this Tower built behind it for it's Security and Defence. The Tower is now the Hall of the <HI>Wallers, Brick-layers</HI> and <HI>Plai&s;terers,</HI> and was repair'd by them <HI>Anno Dom'</HI> 1711, <HI>Richard Flet|cher,</HI> and <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> Wardens.</P>
<P>THE next Round Tower is <HI>We&s;t-&s;pittle-Tower,</HI> which had in Ward the <HI>Side</HI> upon the We&s;t Rawe under the Ca&s;tle Moat, from the <HI>Ca&s;tle-gate,</HI> &s;o down|ward on that Rawe, to and with a great Wa&s;te belonging to <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> oppo&s;ite to a Corner Shop of a Chauntery in St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Kirk,</HI> next the Pant; al&s;o from that Pant upwards upon the Ea&s;t-Rawe in the <HI>Side,</HI> with the <HI>South Kirk-Style</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> by the Ea&s;t-Side of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Tower has it's Name from St. <HI>Mary the Virgin's Ho&s;pital,</HI> which was otherwi&s;e called <HI>We&s;t-&s;pittle,</HI> to which it almo&s;t adjoins; it mu&s;t have been built by the Ma&s;ter and Brethren of that Ho&s;pital for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that the other two Towers before-mentioned were built by their &s;uppo&s;ed Founders.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="24">THE Tower next to this has the Name of <HI>Stank-Tower.</HI> It had in Ward all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Now called</HI> Back-rawe.</NOTE> <HI>Gallowgate;</HI> oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Yates,</HI> &s;o going Northward, from the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Gallowgate,</HI> upwards that &s;ame Rawe, unto the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Den|ton-Chare,</HI> with the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> with all the Hou&s;es oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> down to St. <HI>Nicholas Pant,</HI> as their Doors open towards the <HI>Iron-market,</HI> or towards the Pant, or towards St. <HI>Nicholas Kirk-Yard.</HI></P>

<P>A little beyond this Tower, oppo&s;ite to the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Black-Friers</HI> is a <HI>little Gate</HI> in the Wall, which I imagine to be one of tho&s;e which <HI>Grey</HI> calls <HI>Po&s;tern-Gates.</HI> It leads into the <HI>Warden</HI>'s-<HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> and was made in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t. The <HI>Black Fryers</HI> petition'd the King, he being then at <HI>Durham,</HI> that they might have a Pa&s;&s;age though his <HI>New Wall</HI> into their Garden, which was accordingly granted. The original Grant is &s;till in Being, with the King's Seal at it, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Jo&s;hua Douglas,</HI> who obliged me with the following Copy of it.</P>

<P>THIS Gate of all the others is not only the &s;tronge&s;t, but al&s;o the mo&s;t ancient.

<P><HI>PILGRIM-STREET-GATE</HI> had it's Name from the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> who were wont to lodge in that Street, and go out of that Gate when they came to vi&s;it the Shrine of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>Ge&s;munde;</HI> to which Place with great Confluence and Devotion they came from all Parts of this Land in the&s;e Times of Super&s;tition.

<PB N="16" REF="27">
of them Magi&s;trates of <HI>Newca&s;tle:</HI> and as this appears probable from the Name, &s;o it is al&s;o equally probable that the Founder of this Tower had his Hou&s;e &s;omewhere at the Head of <HI>Pilgrim&s;treet,</HI> nigh his own Tower, as <HI>Ne|vel</HI>'s Tower was behind his Hou&s;e; and that the Field called vulgarly <HI>Carling Croft,</HI> had it's Name of <HI>Carliol Croft,</HI> being at that Time of Day the Property of this Founder. The la&s;t Mayor of this Town of that Name, before the Completion of the Walls, was <HI>Nicholas de Carliol</HI> in the 2d Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, &s;o that this Tower could not be much later in Building, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it's Antiquity imaginable; but it is rather probable it was built a good while earlier.

<P>But the learned Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> upon this Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Bede</HI> is of another Opi|nion. He &s;ays, it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Walton,</HI> but this, he adds, can't be true.

<P>THIS Tower commonly called the <HI>Carpenters</HI> Tower, becau&s;e the Com|pany of Carpenters or Ship-wrights meet in it, was one of the Towers of the <HI>Old Romans.</HI> This Company in the Year 1716, built upon the under Part of it a very grand and &s;tately <HI>Square-Tower,</HI> adorn'd at the Top Cor|ners with 4 <HI>fair Turrets</HI> built in the form of a Lanthorn.</P>
<P><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Lib. de Reb. Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE>BUT before the taking down the Top of the old Tower, it was much of the &s;ame Size, Model, and Stone with the Tower of <HI>Routche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> which was certainly one of the Towers belonging to the <HI>Picts-Wall.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is under it an ancient Po&s;tern-gate, which leads into the Field called the <HI>Garth-Heads,</HI> the mo&s;t part of which was la&s;t Year enclo&s;ed and turned into Garden-ground, by <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Owner of it.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Sandgate,</HI> which is &s;o called becau&s;e, it was built upon the Sand, or the River-&s;ide, is a Wall, having many little Gates in it, extending it&s;elf as far as the <HI>Merchant</HI>'s Hall, along the Street called the <HI>Key-&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be forgot what is mentioned in the Manu&s;cript of Mr. <HI>John Milbank,</HI> that between every one of the&s;e Towers, there were for the mo&s;t Part 2 <HI>Watch-Towers</HI> made &s;quare, with the Effigies of Men cut in Stone up|on the Tops of them, as tho' they were <HI>watching,</HI> and they were called <HI>Gar|ret,</HI> which had Square Holes over the Walls to through Sones down.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e Walls were fini&s;hed is not exactly found. <HI>Grey</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Grey 7.</NOTE> &s;eems to think they were fini&s;hed &s;ome little Time before the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th.</P>
<P>BUT this I imagine is a Date too late for the fini&s;hing of them; for <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th, in the 4th Year of his Reign, <HI>Aug.</HI> 16, granted at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Port-tefract,</HI> that all Fines, Redemptions, Amerciaments, I&s;&s;ues, Forfeitures and Profits, as well of Pleas as that of Ju&s;tices of the Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be received by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Burge&s;&s;es</HI> of this <HI>Town</HI> and their <HI>Officers,</HI> for &s;upporting, amending, and repairing the <HI>Walls, Bridges</HI> and <HI>Gates of the Town.</HI> The Walls then in this Reign mu&s;t have been compleated, fora&s;much as they then probably wan|ted Repairs.</P>
<P>BUT further had <HI>Grey</HI> remembered his own Story above-mention'd, of the 300 <HI>valiant Men,</HI> that i&s;&s;ued out at the <HI>White-fryer-gate,</HI> and put the <HI>Scotti&s;h Army</HI> to flight, he would &s;urely have concluded that the Walls were fini&s;hed before that Accident, which hapned in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. Certain|ly the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Army, which is &s;aid to have been a great one, would not have
<PB N="18" REF="29">
lodged without the Town if they could have lodged in it, and what &s;hould hinder their lodging in it, but the Walls of the Town well guarded? I con|clude therefore that the Walls of the Town at the late&s;t were compleated in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, before the Year 1342 for it was in this Year that this Tran&s;action hapned.</P>
<P>AFTER they were fini&s;hed, it <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Grey 27.</NOTE> was famous for being a Bullwark again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> all the Power of <HI>Scotland</HI> could never win it, but of late, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Time of the Civil Wars, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it was &s;tormed, and our Churches and Hou&s;es defaced, and the Ornaments of both taken away.</P>
<P>IT is now going fa&s;t into Ruins, &s;everal of the <HI>Turrets</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>round Towers</HI> being fallen; but the Towers which &s;tand, together with &s;ome lit|tle Parts of the Wall adjoining to them, are kept in good Repair by their re&s;pective Companies.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Dominicans</HI> commonly called <HI>Black-Fryers, Preaching-Fryers,</HI> and <HI>Ja|cobine Fryers,</HI> came over into <HI>England</HI> in the Year of our Lord <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Fuller C. Hi&s;t.</NOTE> 1221, or as others &s;ay, 1217, and had their fir&s;t Re&s;idence in <HI>Oxford,</HI> they were a <HI>Prior</HI> and 12 <HI>Brethren;</HI> their Prior's Name was <HI>Gilbert de Fraxineto;</HI> the Name of the Order was taken from St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> born at <HI>Cologona</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> Of this Order were no &s;ewer than four&s;core famous Engli&s;h Writers.</P>
<P><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">De reb. Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE>This Mona&s;tery was founded by Sir <HI>Peter Scott,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Mayor of <HI>Newca&s;tle, Anno</HI> 1251, and Sir <HI>Nicholas Scott</HI> his Son, who was one of the 4 Bailiffs of the Town, 1254, 1257, and <HI>Capital Bailiff,</HI> 1269; but the Site of it was given by 3 Si&s;ters, who&s;e Names have long &s;ince been ingratefully buried in Oblivion.</P>
<P>WHEN was the particular Time of it's Building, I have met with no Ac|count; but it is not difficult to give a probable Gue&s;s; the Order it&s;elf of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> or <HI>Black-Fryes</HI> came into <HI>England,</HI> as is mentioned above, in the Year 1221; con&s;equently it mu&s;t have been founded after that Time: And that it mu&s;t have been founded &s;ome Years before the Year 1280, is plain to a Demon&s;tration. For in that Year, which was the Eight of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> had Licence from the King to break a Door through this <HI>New Wall,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Town Wall.</NOTE> into their Garden; which proves them a regular &s;ettled Body at that Time; and therefore that their Priory was built &s;ome Years before that Licence.</P>

<P>IT has been a very &s;tately and Beautiful Building, as appears by the pre&s;ent Remains of it.

This Mona&s;tery was dependant upon the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d, the Brethren of this Mona&s;tery had Li|cen&s;e granted them for the Building of a <HI>Drawbridge,</HI> beyond the <HI>New Ditch</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>WHO were the <HI>Priors</HI> of this Mona&s;tery, what eminent Men belonged to them, or what Things were tran&s;acted by them from their Beginning 'till their Di&s;&s;olution, were Things undoubtedly pre&s;erved among them&s;elves whil&s;t they were a Body; but, after their Surrender, were either de&s;troy'd, or have not yet come to Light.</P>
<P>ONE of the Priors of this Mona&s;tery was one <HI>Richard Mar&s;hall.</HI> I take this Gentleman to have been the la&s;t <HI>Prior</HI> of this Mona&s;tery, for in the 28th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, a Grant of a Tenement, nigh the White-Cro&s;s, (&s;igned by Fryer <HI>Richard Mar&s;hal,</HI> Dr. and Prior; and Fryer <HI>David Simp&s;on,</HI> and Fryer <HI>John Sowrby</HI>) was given to <HI>Anthony God&s;ave,</HI> upon his paying to the &s;aid Pri|ory or Mona&s;tery 9 <HI>s.</HI> per Ann.

He pays the &s;ame Rent to the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which the Tenement pay'd to the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>ABOUT 2 Years after the Signing of this Deed, in <HI>January</HI> the 30th of this Reign this Mona&s;tery &s;urrendered; it con&s;i&s;ted of a <HI>Prior,</HI> and <HI>Twelve Fryers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. II <HI>The</HI> VICARAGE.</HEAD>
<P>IN coming back by the narrow Lane which led to the <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> we face a little Street called <HI>Fennel Street,</HI> which leads into <HI>We&s;tgate;</HI> a Street more retired than any other in this Town; there being no Artificers or Me|chanicks in this Street, nor any Market. It is chiefly inhabited by the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Gentry;</HI> and indeed it &s;eems all along to have been inhabited by &s;uch more than by others. In &s;ome Writings above 400 Years old, we meet with the Names of &s;ome <HI>Clergy-men</HI> who lived in this Street, <HI>viz. Robertus de Gonwerton, Thomas Abelot, &amp;c.</HI> not to mention tho&s;e who belonged to the Mona&s;teries and Ho&s;pitals; and <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that the Men who lived in this Street in his Time, had Employment for both Town and Country, he &s;ays al&s;o that in old Time the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> had his Hou&s;e in this Street.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent &s;everal of the Hou&s;es in it, are large and beautiful; &s;uch are the Hou&s;es of the Lady <HI>Clavering,</HI> of <HI>Utrick Whitfield,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Thomas Ord,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Abraham Dixon,</HI> &amp;c. in the Upper Part of it; and of <HI>George Grey,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and others adjoining to him in the lower Parts of it.</P>
<P>ON the North Side of this Street, a little above St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church, is the <HI>Vicarage</HI> Hou&s;e, the Dwelling of the <HI>Vicars</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> It &s;tands, at lea&s;t e|qually plea&s;ant with the other Hou&s;es in this Place, being &s;ituated in the mid|dle of Fields and Gardens, and more retir'd, being at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Street.</P>
<P>WHO it was that built this Hou&s;e, I have not been able to learn; but 'tis not improbable that it was the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who has been al|ways famous for it's Genero&s;ity to it's Clergy; as the Vicarage it&s;elf in par|ticular mu&s;t always acknowledge. It is at pre&s;ent more beautiful and conve|nient than it was wont to be, having been repair'd and enlarged in the Year 1694, by the Rev. and Worthy Dr. <HI>Elli&s;on,</HI> the then <HI>Vicar.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Hall</HI> belonging to this Hou&s;e, built in a very grand and &s;tate|ly Manner, according to the Ho&s;pitality of the Times it was built in. In particular, it was the Place where the <HI>Vicars</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> were wont to en|tertain the inferiour Officers of Churches, the <HI>Clarks, Sextons, &amp;c.</HI> at the Sea&s;on of <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> If I am not very much mi&s;taken, there are many &s;till living, who remember this laudable Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Garden</HI> belonging to this Hou&s;e, tho' beneath &s;ome others in this Street for Art and Curio&s;ity, and Beauty of Flowers; yet in this it glories above all the others, that the <HI>Roman-Wall,</HI> which was undoubtedly one of the great Works of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed through the middle of it.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>Of St.</HI> JOHN's CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Church is &s;ituated almo&s;t clo&s;e to the Vicarage. It is dedicated to St. <HI>John the Bapti&s;t;</HI> but who was the Founder I never met with: I am inclinable to believe it was founded by the <HI>Towns-people,</HI> notwith&s;tanding a Conjecture of an <HI>Anonymous Gentleman,</HI> which is, that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was the Builder of this Church. But this I think is impo&s;&s;ible; for the earlie&s;t he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived, is about the Year 1430, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, when <HI>John Rhodes,</HI> who was perhaps his Father, was Mayor; whereas it is certain this Church was built at lea&s;t an Hundred Years before. For the Grant of <HI>Adam</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> to the the Prie&s;t of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr's <HI>Chan|tery</HI> in this Church, bears Date the 26th of <HI>March,</HI> 1319, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d; con&s;equently then the Church mu&s;t have been in being at this Time, and &s;o could not have been built by <HI>Robert Rhodes.</HI> Nay, in a Charter dated 1287, belonging to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Mel&s;omby,</HI> to whom I have been obliged for a Sight of a great many Writings, I meet with the&s;e Words, <HI>Venellum quo itur ad Eccle&s;iam Sancti Joannis.</HI> So that this Church was &s;till earlier in Being, <HI>viz.</HI> in the 15th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t. However, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>Steeple</HI> of this Church was either built, or at lea&s;t beautified by him, as al&s;o the <HI>South-Cro&s;s</HI> of the Church; for his <HI>Coat of Arms,</HI> as al&s;o the&s;e Words, <HI>Orate pro Anima Roberti Rhodes,</HI> are upon both of them; which indeed makes it &s;omewhat probable.</P>
<P>THIS Church, as <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, was commended by an <HI>Arch-Prelate</HI> of this Kingdom, becau&s;e it re&s;embleth much a <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Churches were u&s;ually built in form of the Cro&s;s, to repre&s;ent and comme|morate the Cro&s;s on which our Lord died.</NOTE> <HI>Cro&s;s;</HI> which indeed it does more than any other in this Town.</P>
<P>THERE were three <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Chanteries con&s;i&s;ted of Salaries al|lowed to one or more Prie&s;ts to &s;ay daily Ma&s;&s;es for the Souls of their decea&s;ed Founders, and their Friends.

<P>WHEN this Prie&s;t of the Chantry dyed, another was to be cho&s;en (after the Decea&s;e of the Benefactor <HI>Adam</HI>) by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Bailiffs</HI> of this Town for the Time being, together with four of the mo&s;t di&s;creet, and judicious Men of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>John</HI> elected for that Purpo&s;e.

If he was taken with a Fit of Sickne&s;s, he was obliged to provide another at his own Expence to wait upon the Altar. They had a Power al&s;o of turning him out, and putting another in his Stead, if any Scan|dalous Crime was proved upon him.</P>
<P>THIS Writing was &s;ealed by the Seal of the Benefactor, and the <HI>Common Seal of the Town of Newca&s;tle;</HI> and Witne&s;&s;ed, by <HI>Richard de Emelden,</HI> then Mayor, <HI>Thomas de Fri&s;mari&s;co, Richard de Acton, William de Burneton, Gilbert de Hankyn,</HI> Bailiffs of the Town, Sir <HI>Nicholas Scot,</HI> Knight, <HI>Nicholas de Car|leol, Thomas de Carleol, Peter Graper,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE yearly Value of this Chantry was 4 <HI>l.</HI> 3 <HI>s.</HI> which was rai&s;ed out of certain Tenements in the <HI>Sandhill</HI> and <HI>We&s;tgate.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Chantry belonging to this Church, was that of <HI>our Lady,</HI> founded by <HI>Edward Scott,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d; the yearly Value of which was 4 <HI>l.</HI> 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> which aro&s;e out of Tenements in the <HI>Sandhill</HI> and <HI>We&s;tgate.</HI></P>
<P>THE 3d Chantry was that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> founded by <HI>John Dalton, William Atkin&s;hawe,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Accliffe,</HI> Clerks; the yearly Value of which was 5 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> which aro&s;e out of Tenements in <HI>We&s;tgate, Side,</HI> without <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> and a Clo&s;e without <HI>We&s;tgate.</HI></P>
<P>I have been told, that the <HI>Painted Gla&s;s</HI> on one of the South Windows of the Quire of this Church, had on it the Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> It does indeed &s;till re&s;emble &s;ome &s;uch Thing, but, if the Knowledge of it was need|ful, it might be Queried whether it ever was any &s;uch Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>THERE is another Thing at the Top of this Quire, which tho' little known, is yet of greater Certainty; and that is, the <HI>Funnel,</HI> or <HI>Wood Box,</HI> in the Form of a <HI>Spout,</HI> which hangs from the Top of this Quire. This was a Conveyance for an Artificial <HI>Dove,</HI> on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> in the Times of Popery, to repre&s;ent the <HI>De&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> That there were &s;uch Things in Churches, tho' in none that I know of in this Town, but this; is Matter of Fact.

<P>THERE was formerly an <HI>Organ</HI> in this Church. This appears from the la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament of Mr. <HI>John Wilkin&s;on,</HI> Merchant of this Town, who was one of the Ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Mr. <HI>John Wilkin&s;on</HI> Merchant, to whom I am obliged for a Sight of this Will.

<P>I have not been able to collect more of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Curates</HI> of this Pa|ri&s;h, than the&s;e following.</P>
<P><HI>ROBERT Urguart,</HI> who &s;uffered in the Beginning of the <HI>Civil-Wars.</HI> He afterwards went beyond the Seas, turn'd <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and dyed in a Convent.</P>
<P><HI>JOHN Shaw.</HI> He was the Son of a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> born at <HI>Bedlington,</HI> was fir&s;t of <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>College;</HI> from whence he removed to that of <HI>Brazen-No&s;e</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI> In the Year 1645, he was both in&s;tituted and inducted to the Re|ctory of <HI>Whalton,</HI> but not permitted to enjoy it. However, with much ado he afterwards got the Church of <HI>Bolton</HI> in <HI>Craven</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire:</HI> Which being but half the Value of <HI>Whalton,</HI> they allowed him to keep it.</P>
<P>IN 1661 he returned to <HI>Whalton;</HI> was made Preacher al&s;o of the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>John</HI>'s in <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> twice cho&s;en a Member of the <HI>Convocati|on</HI> for <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> and if I mi&s;take not, &s;erved once for the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Arch|deacoury</HI> of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> He was a Man of good Learning and of an un|blameable Life, a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of the Orders of the Church: Somewhat warm in his Temper; equally zealous again&s;t <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Presbytery,</HI> with it's Brood of Sectaries; as appears by his Writings: The <HI>Gout</HI> confin'd him to his Hou&s;e, and at la&s;t to his Bed, &s;ome Years before his Death. He bore his Affliction with Chri&s;tian Fortitude; being patient, re&s;ign'd, and chearful un|der it; more &s;olicitous for God's Church than for him&s;elf, and died in a good old Age, in the Year 1689. I had almo&s;t omitted to &s;ay, that he was impri|&s;oned no le&s;s than <HI>four Years by the Rebels.</HI></P>

<P>OPPOSITE to St. <HI>John</HI>'s, on the other Side of the Street, is the Ho&s;|pital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which contains two Foundations, an Old one,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Lib.

The old one mu&s;t have been founded, not many Years after the <HI>Nunnery</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> which was founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t: For in a Char|ter granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, to the <HI>Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> there is mention made of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in this Town, as may be &s;een in our Account of <HI>the&s;e Nuns.</HI> But this Conjecture will be more confirm'd, if it be con&s;ider'd that a Charity was be&s;tow'd on <HI>this Ho&s;pital</HI> by the Lord <HI>Walter de Bolbeck,</HI> (as is mention'd below) who,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gib. Camb. p. 855.</NOTE> as we are told, in a Charter dated the fir&s;t Year of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> convey'd &s;ome Lands to the Church of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> If this was the &s;ame <HI>Walter</HI> with him below, and there appears nothing to the con|trary; then it is a &s;trong Rea&s;on, that <HI>this Ho&s;pital</HI> was founded in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t's Reign.

<P>WE learn al&s;o from the &s;ame Charter, that the Founder devoted him&s;elf to God and Religion, as he him&s;elf &s;ays, (according to the Way of that Age) I render my &s;elf to God, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and the Brethren of the &s;ame Ho&s;pital there &s;erving God; to do Works of Ho&s;pitality to the Poor,

<P>SOME of the Witne&s;&s;es to this Foundation Charter, were <HI>Gilbert,</HI> Par&s;on of <HI>Eland, Richard,</HI> Par&s;on of <HI>Standfordham, Waldon</HI> Par&s;on of <HI>Newburne, Eu&s;ta|chius,</HI> Par&s;on of <HI>Benton.</HI></P>
<P>THE particular Time when it was founded can't be exactly learned; there being no Date at the Charter. But it is probable from a Charter of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Fir&s;t, that it was founded &s;ome little while before he began to Reign; for when he confirms the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Sciatis me dedi&s;le &amp; conce&s;&s;i&s;&s;e Domino &amp; Sanctae Ma|riae &amp; San|ctimoniali|bus de <HI>Novo Ca&s;tello,</HI> pro &s;alute Ani|mae meae &amp; antece&s;&s;o|rum meo|rum, <HI>Aselack Burgeum me|um de Novo Ca&s;tello,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>WE meet al&s;o with an Account of a Third Foundation belonging to this <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> which Account is this. The <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> of our <HI>Lady,</HI> called <HI>We&s;tgate Spittle,</HI> was founded by the Inhabitants of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> for a <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Chaplain</HI> to &s;ay Divine Service for 6 <HI>Bede Folks</HI> in the <HI>Alms-hou&s;e,</HI> and to lodge <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>way-faring People,</HI> and to <HI>bury</HI> &s;uch as hapned to die there, and to di&s;tribute yearly <HI>Nine Chaldron</HI> of <HI>Coals</HI> among poor People. The yearly Value of this was 33 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s. De Rebus Novoca&s;t'.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the founding of this <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> and <HI>Chapel,</HI> there were &s;everal Dona|tions and Charities be&s;towed upon it, as had been before upon the old one; &s;ome of the <HI>Benefactors</HI> of both which, and Ma&s;ters among a large Number which might be mentioned, are the&s;e following.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Grammar-School</HI> of this Town, which is now at <HI>We&s;t-&s;pittle,</HI> was ori|ginally founded by <HI>Thomas Hor&s;ly,</HI> who was <HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1525.

<P><PB N="34" REF="45">BUT in the Year 1559 it was removed from St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Church-yard, (from that Hou&s;e which is on the North Side of the Church, over that Place where the <HI>Privy</HI> now is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

<HEAD>Sect. V. EARL <HI>of</HI> WESTMORELAND<HI>'s Hou&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NEXT to St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, on the &s;ame Side of this Street, is a very old Buil|ding, which was lately the Dwelling-hou&s;e of Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> K^t. <HI>Recorder of this Town,</HI> now the Property and Dwelling-hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark,</HI> Jun^r. It has the Magnificence and Grandure of Antiquity in it's Looks, but what it has been formerly I could never find out. <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, That in this Street the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> had his Hou&s;e, which indeed is true. It was built by the Baron of <HI>Bywell</HI> and <HI>Bolbeck,</HI> about the 9th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. Much about the &s;ame Time he built a Hou&s;e within the Bounds of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> for the Defence of it, as may be &s;een in our Account of the <HI>Ca&s;tle.</HI> This Hou&s;e in <HI>We&s;tgate</HI> was called <HI>Bolbeck-Hall;</HI> but afterwards, upon it's Founder's being created <HI>Earl,</HI> which was in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, in the Year 1398, when <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Lord of <HI>Raby</HI> was created <HI>Earl Mar|&s;hall,</HI> it got the Name of <HI>We&s;tmoreland-Place</HI> in <HI>We&s;gate.</HI> Some have conje|ctured, that Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s Hou&s;e, above-mentioned, was part of it, and
<PB N="36" REF="47">
indeed it looks much liker a Part of &s;uch a Building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. We&s;tmor|land<HI>'s hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> than any other Thing remaining thereabouts. I am &s;ure much more &s;o than the Hou&s;e which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been it, which I am told was the Hou&s;e oppo&s;ite to the We&s;t End of <HI>Denton-Chair,</HI> which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cowling</HI> lately lived in, and which belongs to Mr. <HI>Ord.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, be this as it will, whether it was this Hou&s;e now mention|ed, or whether <HI>We&s;tmoreland-Place</HI> reached from this Hou&s;e to Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s, including it, which &s;ome have conjectured; yet this is certain, that it mu&s;t have been hereabouts: for <HI>Nevil Tower</HI> is directly behind this Piece of Ground we are &s;peaking of, which is a &s;ure Token this mu&s;t be the very Place, becau&s;e, whoever in the Town built a Tower at their own Expence, it was generally nigh them for their own Security. Thus the <HI>White-Fryers;</HI> the Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Ho&s;pital; the Brethren of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> &amp;c. Built their Towers over again&s;t their <HI>Mona&s;teries,</HI> for their own Safe-guard and Se|curity. But what I think puts it out of Di&s;pute, that Sir <HI>Robert Shafto</HI>'s Hou&s;e was no Part of it, is that in the Eleventh of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> upon the Attainder of <HI>Charles,</HI> Earl of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> this Hou&s;e where Mr. <HI>Cow|ling</HI> lived, was in Charge, which the other never was, before the Auditors; and in the Third of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, was &s;old to the Citizens of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Lib. de re|bus Novo|ca&s;t.</NOTE>IT was afterwards in the Tenure of <HI>James Bertram,</HI> and after that in the Tenure of <HI>Robert Bertram.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this Hou&s;e, is a Chair or Lane, called <HI>Denton</HI>-Chair, which leads into the <HI>Groat-Market, Middle-&s;treet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS Street is continued 'till you come to the Street leading We&s;tward to the <HI>Po&s;tern,</HI> and Ea&s;tward to the <HI>Back-raw:</HI> From thence the Street changes it's Name, and is called <HI>Tuthill,</HI> 'till you come to the <HI>Tuthill Stairs,</HI> which lead into the <HI>Clo&s;e.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sect. VI. BAILIFF GATE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the Ea&s;t-Side of this Street, is a Street facing the We&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> called <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> which is &s;aid to have got it's Name from the Coming of the <HI>Fellons,</HI> of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> along that Street at|tended by the County Bailiffs. They came, as is &s;aid, to the <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> then down an old Way, clo&s;e by the Out-&s;ide of the <HI>Town-Wall,</HI> and &s;o in at the <HI>White-Fryer Gate,</HI> from whence they went along <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> and &s;o were conveyed in at the <HI>Po&s;tern-Gate,</HI> on the We&s;t-Side of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> oppo&s;ite to this Street of <HI>Bailiff Gate.</HI> This is only Traditional, and has been therefore deny'd by the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle. Grey</HI>'s Account is, That at this Gate the Pri&s;oners were brought in, who were taken in Times of Ho&s;tility with <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and carry'd from thence privately into the Ca&s;tle, where the Goal for the County is now.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Author al&s;o tells us, that this Street of <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> formerly belonged to the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> and County of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> But I imagine, had this been true, the <HI>King</HI> would long ago have had his Right. The Town of

<HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> indeed has &s;ometimes been made unea&s;y about that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bailiff-gate.</NOTE> but &s;till had it &s;urer fixed to her, as her undoubted property.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1649, the Year after the King was beheaded, there was a Sur|vey taken of <HI>Bailiff Gate,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the Year following, <HI>April</HI> 25th, 1650, an Order was &s;ent down for an|nulling and vacating the Survey made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was as follows;</P>

<P>WHEREAS <HI>the Mayor, Burge&s;&s;es, and other the Inhabitants of the Town of</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, did prefer their Petition unto this Committee, complaining, that certain Per&s;ons employed for the Common Wealth, have returned a Survey to their Tru&s;tees, for Sale of the late King's Lands, of and concerning di|vers Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments within the &s;aid Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and Precincts thereof, to the Value of <HI>2000 l. 3 s. 4 d. per Annum,</HI> for which they have paid only a Fee Farm Rent to the Crown; and in which the Petitioners declare, they had an indoubted Inheritance: Further complaining, that the Premi&s;&s;es in Que&s;tion, were <HI>not in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown,</HI> Anno <HI>1635,</HI> neither was there returned any &s;pecial Matter in the Survey, whereby to entitle the late King to the &s;ame: The Petitioners being the <HI>undoubted Proprietors and Owners of the Things in Que&s;tion.</HI> And whereas upon reading of the &s;aid Petition, and the Certificate of the Tru&s;tees and Survey, made in pur&s;uance of an Order of this Com|mittee, grounded upon the &s;aid Petition, and the hearing of this Cau&s;e this Day be|fore the Committee, concerning the Premi&s;&s;es in Que&s;tion, in the Pre&s;ence of Council for the Common Wealth, as al&s;o the Council in behalf of the &s;aid Town: The Coun|cil in behalf of the Common Wealth did acknowledge, <HI>that the &s;aid Survey was returned without any ju&s;t Grounds:</HI> And fora&s;much as <HI>the Council for the &s;aid Town of</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>were ready to produce their Charters and Evidences,</HI> whereby to make it evidently appear, that the Inheritance of the Premi&s;&s;es in Que|&s;tion, <HI>have been for 300 Years and upwards in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Petitioners and their Predece&s;&s;ors.</HI> It is therefore this Day order'd by the Committee, that the Original Survey returned of divers Me&s;&s;uages, Lands and Tenements, and Here|ditaments, within the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and Precincts thereof, held by the &s;aid Town, now remaining with the Tru&s;tees, Surveyor, and Regi&s;ter, for Sale of the &s;aid Lands, <HI>be annull'd and void;</HI> and is hereby vacated, and that no fur|ther Sale, or other Proceedings he had, or made thereupon; and that an Entrance of this Order be made upon the &s;aid Survey, and a Memorandum be made thereupon: That the &s;aid Survey is vacated, to the Intent that the <HI>Mayor, Burge&s;&s;es,</HI> and o|ther Inhabitants of the &s;aid Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> may not for the Future be que&s;ti|oned or mole&s;ted concerning the Premi&s;&s;es mentioned in the &s;aid Survey; and the Tran&s;cript of this Order be likewi&s;e entred with the &s;aid Tru&s;tees, and Contracters for Sales of the &s;aid Lands.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> NEWGATE-STREET. Of the upper and higher Parts of this Street, towards the <HI>North.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE old Part of <HI>Newgate,</HI> together with that Part of the <HI>Wall,</HI> leading as far as <HI>Ever-Tower,</HI> being vi&s;ibly older than the other Towers, and the Re&s;t of the Wall; is a &s;ure Sign that when the Walls were began, this Part of the Town was then inhabited.</P>
<P>IT is probable that hereabouts was the ancient <HI>Monkche|&s;ter,</HI> where the <HI>Monks</HI> and religious Men inhabited. This appears from a Place in this Street, <HI>viz. That Row of Hou&s;es</HI> which &s;tands almo&s;t in the Middle of the Street, called to this Day the <HI>Huck&s;ter</HI>'s <HI>Booths:</HI> For the People who dwelt in the&s;e Hou&s;es, were <HI>Huck&s;ters,</HI> and &s;upplied the Religious Hou&s;es with Provi&s;ions. There is a Tradition &s;till among the Inha|bitants of this Part of the Town, That in old Times there were many Mar|kets between the <HI>Newgate</HI> and the <HI>White-Cro&s;s;</HI> nay, &s;ome of them, according to the Tradition they have received, will Point out the <HI>very Ground</HI> where &s;uch and &s;uch <HI>Markets</HI> were.</P>
<P>NOW this, I think, is a &s;ufficient Proof that the&s;e Upper Parts of the Town were fir&s;t inhabited by the <HI>Monks,</HI> the Lower Parts, as far as the <HI>Ca|&s;tle Yard,</HI> were the Habitations of the <HI>Town's People:</HI> The <HI>Ca&s;tellum,</HI> or For|tification having been thereabouts, from the Beginning of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s Wall, as we are inform'd, by a <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P>Mr. <HI>Hor&s;e|ly</HI> of <HI>Mor|peth,</HI> who dy'd a few Months ago, a little before the publi&s;hing of his <HI>Roma|na Britannia,</HI> the Book re|ferr'd to.</P>

Britt. 132.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>late ingenious Author.</HI> He &s;ays there mu&s;t have been a <HI>Station in this Town,</HI> for the&s;e Rea&s;ons: If we con&s;ider the Importance of this Place, it's Di&s;tance from the fir&s;t Station at the End of the Wall, and the Turns the Wall makes, (e&s;pecially at the Ea&s;t Side of the Town) in Or|der to it's pa&s;&s;ing through the Heart of it; we can &s;carce Que&s;tion but there has been a Station here: And it's old Name of <HI>Monk-Che&s;ter</HI> &s;eems to put it out of Doubt. The former Part of the Name is taken from the Settlement of the <HI>Monks</HI> in this Place, and the latter Part from the Word <HI>Ca&s;tra,</HI> which is a pretty &s;ure Mark of a Station: Be&s;ides the Name <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> (given fir&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="51">
to the Ca&s;tle it &s;elf, and then to the Town) has been thought to imply (as in other In&s;tances) that there was an old <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Vid. Chap. <HI>of the</HI> Ca&s;tle.</NOTE> Ca&s;tle or Fort there before, and near the Place where the <HI>new One</HI> was erected. And as this <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> was built by <HI>Robert,</HI> Son of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, the <HI>old Ca&s;tle</HI> mu&s;t have been undoubtedly <HI>Roman.</HI> And &s;ome Years ago, a Coin of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> was found near the Ca&s;tle, as I was told by the Per&s;on himfelf that found it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame learned Author goes on thus: The next Thing is to determine the Boundaries and Situation of this Station, which I per&s;uade my &s;elf may be done. I hinted before that there was a Traditionary Account of the Walls pa&s;&s;ing through St. <HI>George</HI>'s Porch, near the North We&s;t Corner of St. <HI>Ni|cholas</HI> Church. But it is certain that the Line of the Wall lies a little to the North of this End of the Church, and I think has not touched this Porch, tho' it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture, that the Wall which has pa&s;&s;ed through this Porch, mu&s;t have been the Ea&s;t Rampart of the Station; for the Suppo&s;ition will reconcile the&s;e &s;eemingly differing Accounts: And if a Line be erected Perpendicular to that of <HI>Severius</HI>'s Wall, &s;o as to pa&s;s thro' that Porch, and be continued along the Brow of the Hill, at the Head of the Side, 'till it meet the Line of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s <HI>Vallum,</HI> near the Ea&s;t End of <HI>Balygate,</HI> and not far from the Ca&s;tle. This Line &s;eems to an&s;wer &s;o well in Re&s;pects, that I cannot much Doubt it's having been the Ea&s;tern Limits of the ancient Station: For this brings the Station near to the Ca&s;tle, which probably has been built a little more to the South Ea&s;t, in order to bring it nearer to the Top of a Steep Hill. And fixing the Ea&s;tern Boundary of the Station here, leaves a Plain and Level Area for the Station it &s;elf, and with|out it, a De&s;cent towards the South and the River, for the Town to &s;tand upon, which might extend it &s;elf to the Bridge, &s;uppo&s;ing the ancient Bridge to be near the &s;ame Place where the pre&s;ent one &s;tands: From which Bridge the ancient Town and Station might probably take the Name of <HI>Pons-Aelii</HI> This Ea&s;tern Boundary of the Station mu&s;t at that Time have been near|er the River, than it is now now; &s;ince 'tis certain, that the River formerly flowed farther up towards this Part of the Town. The Po&s;ition of the Ea|&s;tern Rampart of the Station being thus determined, the other Boundaries may be al&s;o defined; for the Di&s;tance here between the Lines of the Walls &s;eems to be about &s;ix Chains; and it is not much to be que&s;tioned, but the two Walls here, (as in other Ca&s;es they frequently did) have fallen in with the Northern and Southern Ramparts of the Station; &s;o that the&s;e &s;ix Chains have been the Breadth of the Station. And if we &s;uppo&s;e the Station to have been of a middle Size, we mu&s;t make it a Square, and allow &s;ix Chains for the length of it. If at this Di&s;tance another Line be drawn equal and Parallel to the former, and between the Lines of the Wall, it will be the We&s;tern Boun|dary of the Station, as the two re&s;pective Parts of the two Walls make the Northern and Southern Limits. And upon this Suppo&s;ition, a Line drawn from the Foot of the <HI>Fle&s;h-market</HI> to <HI>Baily-gate,</HI> near the ea&s;t End of it, will be the Ea&s;tern Limits of the ancient Station. That Part of the <HI>Vallum</HI> which reaches from <HI>Baily-gate</HI> to Mr. <HI>Ord</HI>'s Hou&s;e, will be the Southern Limit; and a Line drawn from hence, to that Part of the Line of <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall, which is about thirty Yards Ea&s;t from the End of <HI>Ro&s;emary-lane,</HI> mu&s;t be the We|&s;tern Boundary, and the Part of <HI>Severus</HI>'s Wall included between this and the Foot of the <HI>Fle&s;h-market,</HI> remains for the Line of the Northern Rampart.</P>

<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">De Reb. Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by one of the Kings of <HI>Scotland.

Indeed, that <HI>David,</HI> who dy'd in the Year 1153, was a great Benefactor to <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Religious Hou&s;es,</HI> and he is &s;aid in particular to have founded in this Town <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Collier Ec|cle&s;.</NOTE> two <HI>Religious Hou&s;es,</HI> but there is not a Word of his being the Founder of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, which in all Probability would as &s;oon have been taken Notice of, and handed down to Po&s;terity, had it been true; as the Building of two <HI>Religious Hou&s;es.</HI> But be&s;ides, if St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s be the olde&s;t Church in this Town, and this I think ought to be allowed for the Rea&s;ons already given, as al&s;o from the con&s;tant Tradition of it's being &s;o, then it is undoubtedly older than St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s, and if &s;o, it mu&s;t have been built before the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t; for St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s was built in that Reign, at late&s;t; and therefore it will follow, that this Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s was built before <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> was born.</P>
<P>I am therefore rather inclinable to believe, that it was founded by the <HI>Town's People,</HI> and the <HI>Religious Hou&s;es,</HI> which at that Time of Day were chiefly in tho&s;e higher Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>THERE were three <HI>Chanteries</HI> belonging to this Church; one of which was dedicated to our <HI>Lady,</HI> which was of the Yearly Value of 6 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> No Deed of Foundation is &s;hewed, but however it mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been founded in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t; for in the latter End of that Reign, in a Charter which one <HI>Roger Amyas</HI> granted to one <HI>Stephen</HI>&mdash;, it is order|ed, that he &s;hall have &s;uch a particular <HI>Booth</HI> for the Term of 30 Years: Pro|vided he pay &s;o much to the <HI>Tyne Bridge,</HI> and to the <HI>Altar</HI> of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s in <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>IT had a Hou&s;e of <HI>Seven Shillings</HI> per Annum belonging to it; it abutted on the North, next to the <HI>New-gate</HI> and on the Ea&s;t on the <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> on the We&s;t on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church-yard, and on the South on a Tenement, which in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> belonged to <HI>Robert Hallyman.</HI></P>

<P>I Had the Curio&s;ity lately to &s;earch among the Old Writings in your Ve&s;try, for that famous <HI>Indulgence,</HI> which is &s;aid to have been <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vid. Grey. p. 12.</NOTE> granted to your Church by the Pope for <HI>Nine thou&s;and Years to come;</HI> but found no &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53">THERE is however another Indulgence which di&s;covers a Piece of Anti|quity, relating to your Church, which I chu&s;ed to acquaint you with in this Manner, that the ancient Name of a Part of your Church, now worn out of the Memories of our <HI>Towns-men,</HI> and almo&s;t intirely lo&s;t, might again be brought to light.</P>
<P>THIS Indulgence was granted in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, in the Year 1392, an Age in which Indulgencies were common, and when they were of Particular Service towards the Building or repairing of Chur|ches. For at that Time of Day, when the Building, or repairing, or adorn|ing of a Church was requi&s;ite, an Indulgence was granted for &s;uch a Term of Years or Days, to all &s;uch as would be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Things afore&s;aid; by which Means many Churches have been built, repair'd and beautified, and accordingly this Indulgence of yours was granted partly for the &s;ame End, that the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s might be kept in &s;ufficient Repair: For it promi|&s;es an Indulgence or Pardon for <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Qui ad re|parationem, &s;eu orna|mentum &s;ive emendatio|nem Eccle|&s;iae Sancti Andreae vil|lae Novoca|&s;tri &s;uper Tynam, lin. 5^0 Indul. &mdash; Quadraginta dies Indul|gentiae con|cedimus.</NOTE> 40 Days to every one, who &s;hall con|tribute towards the repairing or beautifying of the Church of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> and then follows the Antiquity de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>THAT whoever <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ac Capellae Sanctae Tri|nitatis in parte Aqui|lonari eju&s;|dem Eccle|&s;iae aurum argentum, &amp;c. Lin. 6^0 Indulg'.</NOTE> offers or &s;ends, or Cau&s;es to be &s;ent to the <HI>Chapel of the Holy Trinity in the Northern Part of the &s;ame Church,</HI> either Gold, Silver, Ve&s;t|ments, Books, Chalices, or any other Ornaments, which are wanting to the afore&s;aid <HI>Chapel,</HI> or <HI>Altar,</HI> or Image of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> which is in the &s;ame Chapel. &mdash; Or who &s;hall fall down upon their Knees before the <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> afore&s;aid, and pray for the Health of Sir <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> Kn^t as long as he lives, and for his Soul after his Decea&s;e, and for the Soul of the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, who&s;e Body lies buried in the &s;ame <HI>Chapel</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> &s;hall, as often as they perform tho&s;e Things, or any of the Things before-mention'd, have the Benefit of a <HI>Forty Days Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P>NOW from this it is ob&s;ervable, that that wa&s;te Place in the <HI>Northern I&s;le,</HI> which opens into the Quire mu&s;t be the <HI>Chapel</HI> here &s;poken of. For there lies the Body of Sir <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> which is &s;aid in the Indulgence to be buried in the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Et pro Anima Do|minae Mariae &s;pon&s;ae &s;uae cu|jus Corpus in eadem Capel|la &s;anctae Tri|nitatis Qute&s;|cit. <HI>Lin. 9. Indulg.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Chapel of the Holy Trinity;</HI> as al&s;o the Body of Sir <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf. The Building it&s;elf is after the Manner of Chapels, which were added to pari&s;h Chur|ches; and it is &s;till ob&s;ervable, that at the Top of the North Window in the Chapel there &s;eems to be a Picture of the Holy Trinity, repre&s;ented according to the Super&s;tition of the&s;e Times by the face of <HI>an old Man, our Saviour upon the Cro&s;s,</HI> and the Figure of a <HI>Dove;</HI> it having been always Cu&s;tomary in the&s;e Times, not only to have the <HI>Image of the Saint</HI> &s;et up to whom the Church was dedicated, but al&s;o to adorn the Windows with it.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, that Sir <HI>Adam de Athol</HI> him&s;elf was the Founder of this Chapel, and my Rea&s;ons for it are the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, It was cu&s;tomary formerly for People of better Figure, to build a &s;mall Chapel, at a convenient Part of their pari&s;h Church, that they might have a convenient Place to Wor&s;hip God in, or that it might be a burial Place for them and their Families. Now it is evident, that this Chapel of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> is &s;uch a one. For if you &s;uppo&s;e the Chapel away, the Church it|&s;elf will appear exactly uniform; which &s;hews the <HI>Chapel</HI> has been added to the Church; and as Sir <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Lady</HI> are buried in it, is pretty clear that They were the Founders. It may al&s;o be pre&s;umed, that <HI>He</HI> built it, be|cau&s;e it &s;eems to have been built when Sir <HI>Adam</HI> liv'd: For it is &s;aid in the Indulgence to want Books, Chalices, Ve&s;tments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which implies it, at that Time, to have been <HI>a new Chapel.</HI> And be&s;ides, Indulgences were gran|ted towards the adorning of Churches or Chapels, immediately after they were built. This Chapel was therefore built a little before the granting of this In|dulgence, which was when Sir <HI>Adam</HI> was living. And as his Wife was then
<PB N="43" REF="54">
dead and buried in this Chapel; &s;o &s;he &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t that was buried in it, and con&s;equently her Husband mu&s;t have built it.</P>
<P>BUT my la&s;t Rea&s;on, I think, makes it amount to a Demon&s;tration. It may be ob&s;erved in all Indulgences of this Kind, that it was not only requir'd of the People to offer Church Ornaments, but al&s;o to put up Prayers for the Founder. Thus for In&s;tance; in an Indulgence granted in the Reign of King <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI> for the Repairing and Maintaining of the Church and Convent at <HI>Kirby Belers</HI> in the County of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> it was not only required that Money &s;hould be given, but that they &s;hould al&s;o &s;ay a <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Stavely <HI>Ch.

<P>NOW from hence it is plain, that Sir <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Lady</HI> mu&s;t have been the Founder and Foundre&s;s of this Chapel, becau&s;e they alone are men|tioned in this Indulgence, and Prayers were to be put up for them, as they were for Sir <HI>Roger</HI> and his Lady ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>THUS I think I have found out the ancient Name of your Chapel, and who was the Founder it. It may perhaps be &s;omewhat Satisfactory to tho&s;e who are curious in tho&s;e Things, may retrieve the antient Name of your Cha|pel, and e&s;tabli&s;h the de&s;erved Remembrance of it's Founder. But be this as it will; as I have only the&s;e Things in View in making the&s;e Ob&s;ervations; &s;o I hope you'll be &s;o good as to accept of them, and allow them a Place a|mong the Parchments of your Church.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE Indulgence on which the&s;e Ob&s;ervations are founded are granted by <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Candida ca&s;a,</HI> which is in <HI>Gallaway</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is dated at <HI>York</HI> 1392, the 12th Year of his Con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>THE 3d <HI>Chantery</HI> belonging to this Church was dedicated to St. <HI>Thomas.</HI> This I learn from an Account I have met with of a Hou&s;e in this Street, which is &s;aid to have belonged to the <HI>Chantery</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>IT bounder'd on the We&s;t by St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church end, and on the North by a <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> which in the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Richard Atkin&s;on,</HI> and on the Ea&s;t by the <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> and on the South again&s;t the <HI>Church-Style.</HI> It was valued at ten Shillings per Annum.</P>
<P>THAT there was &s;uch a Chantery in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s (notwith&s;tanding the two former are &s;uppo&s;ed to be all belonging to this Church) is further evident, becau&s;e I meet al&s;o with an Account which &s;ays, that the Chantery of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, had an Orchard belonging to it, which paid a yearly Rent of Three Shillings and Four Pence to it; but where it &s;tood is not men|tioned. It was occupied by Sir <HI>Robert Brandlin.</HI></P>
<P>THAT there were Lands belonging to the Chantery of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in this Church, which were &s;ituated in this Street, is certain. But where to fix them at this Time of Day is pretty Difficult. But wherever they were &s;itua|ted,
<PB N="44" REF="55">
there was an Hou&s;e &s;ituated near them, which paid to the <HI>Priory</HI> of <HI>Hex|ham</HI> Six Shillings per Annum.</P>
<P>THIS is mention'd when <HI>Rowland</HI> was Prior, in the Year 1490, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">De Reb. Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE></P>
<P>I meet with no account of the Lands belonging to the Chantery of the <HI>Tri|nity,</HI> except that of an Hou&s;e, &s;ituated in a Place called <HI>le Cow-garth</HI> in this <HI>Newgate-&s;treet,</HI> which paid one Shilling per Annum to this Chantery, and a Tenement in <HI>We&s;tgate</HI> which paid 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>THE Altar of this Church is very pretty and decent, it was beautified a few Years ago at the Charge of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>THERE is at the <HI>We&s;t-end</HI> of this Church a <HI>Beautiful</HI> Gallery, which was built in the Year 1711, at the Charge of the Pari&s;h. In the Year 1726, the <HI>Old Porch</HI> was taken down, and the pre&s;ent one built,

<P>ON the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this Street, near the <HI>New-gate,</HI> is a Tenement which was given by Mrs. <HI>Alice Belay&s;ys</HI> to <HI>Univer&s;ity-College</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI> The Site of it is thus de&s;crib'd; <HI>Situatum e&s;t infra praedictam villam juxta Novam Portam eju&s;dem villae in quo quidem Tenement'</HI> Thomas Gray Lid&s;ter <HI>modo inha|bitat, (viz.)

<P>OPPOSITE to St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church is a Lane, which leads to <HI>Pilgrim|&s;treet</HI> Gate, called the <HI>High-fryer-chare,</HI> becau&s;e of a Fryer which was in it, and becau&s;e it is higher up in the Town than the other Fryer Chare.</P>
<P>IN coming down this Street Southward from the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, on the Right-hand, is an ancient Street called <HI>Darn-crook;</HI> in which Street were &s;ome Wa&s;tes and Hou&s;e belonging to the Nuns of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> as there were in almo&s;t every Street in the Town. Oppo&s;ite to this Place, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this Street of <HI>Newgate</HI> is a little running Water which goes into <HI>Lorkburne.</HI> This little <HI>Bourn</HI> is taken Notice of in the Account of the Ward belonging to <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> and is called there, <HI>a Bourn be&s;ide Lam-place, that runneth towards Lorkburne.</HI> To this Bourn it is, that the Pri&s;oners belonging to <HI>Newgate,</HI> have Liberty to walk during the Time they are not confin'd to the Goal.</P>
<P>FROM thence, going &s;till Southward, the Street changes it's Name from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Huxter</HI>'s <HI>-Booths;</HI> for thereabouts it was that the <HI>Huxters</HI> lived, as has been ob&s;erved above, who &s;upply'd the <HI>Religious-hou&s;es,</HI> and the other Peo|ple of this Part of the Town with Provi&s;ions. A Part of the&s;e Hou&s;es are &s;till to be &s;een, they &s;tand by them&s;elves almo&s;t in the <HI>middle of the Street,</HI> nigh the <HI>White-cro&s;s. Grey</HI> &s;ays, That this Part of the Town was in his Time called the <HI>Huxters-Booths;</HI> that is, as I under&s;tand him, from the <HI>Bourn</HI> above|mentioned, to tho&s;e Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the <HI>Booths</HI> was a great Gate that led into the <HI>Black-fryers.</HI> It was &s;ituated between the Hou&s;e of <HI>William Wilkin&s;on,</HI> Smith, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Elizabeth Bell,</HI> Widow. The Place now is the Entrance of a Garden be|longing to Mr. <HI>Nicholas Baily</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> This I think is evident from a Grant of a Tenement from the <HI>Black-fryers,</HI> now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Tho. Mar|&s;hall,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="59">
of this Town; wherein in de&s;cribing the Situation of the Tenement, are the&s;e Words; <HI>Sicut jacet in villa antedicta prope crucem vulgariter vocatam</HI> Whytt|cro&s;s <HI>inter magnam portam praedictorum Fratrum e Regione praedictae crucis ex parte Boreali,</HI> &amp;c. The Tenement de&s;cribed is the Hou&s;e lately rebuilt by Mr. <HI>Mar|&s;hall</HI> afore&s;aid. Since this Conjecture from the Writing above-mentioned, I have met with the Manu&s;cript of Mr. <HI>Milbank,</HI> which very much corroborates it. The Words are the&s;e; the Gate-way to this Hou&s;e was from the White|cro&s;s, and was called when our Author liv'd, <HI>Wind</HI>'s <HI>-hole.</HI> The way was a narrow Lane to the Fryery, which in his Time was joining to Mr. <HI>Brandling</HI>'s Ground, whereupon there was, (and &s;till is) a Mill.</P>

There is a Tradition that this was a Cell of the <HI>Nuns</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> tho' we cannot readily Quote any Authority for it.</P>
<P>THE Tradition mention'd by the&s;e Gentlemen appears &s;omewhat probable, for in the Charter before-metioned the <HI>Nuns</HI> of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> received two Shillings annually from this Cell.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o not improbable but St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Ho&s;pital in <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> was al&s;o a Cell to this Nunnery: It appearing plainly from the Charter above, that St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s was dependant on it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61">AND it's &s;aid in <HI>Leland,</HI> that the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> was given to the U&s;e of <HI>the&s;e Nuns.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lel. Vol. 1. p. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT appears al&s;o from the Charter ju&s;t above-mentioned, that among the other Things confirmed to this <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> the Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> was one. I may be ask'd therefore where this Church was Situated. In an&s;wer to this I dare venture to &s;ay, that there never was any &s;uch Church in this Town; I mean a Pari&s;h Church: And therefore it mu&s;t have been the Church or <HI>Chapel</HI> belonging to this Ho&s;pital; and con&s;equently mu&s;t have been &s;eated where the Ho&s;pital was. And this appears to be the rather true, becau&s;e we have no other mention made of their <HI>Chapel,</HI> and becau&s;e when it is mention'd in the Charter it is &s;aid to be given them, that they may &s;erve God in it.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1355, <HI>Thomas Hatfield,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> confirmed to the Nuns of this Hou&s;e, the Abbe&s;s they had elected; her Name was <HI>Alice Davill.</HI> She had been not duly elected, and therefore he made the Election void; but however, as &s;he was a Per&s;on the <HI>Convent</HI> very much approv'd of, the Bi&s;hop of his &s;pecial Favour order'd her to pre&s;ide over them.</P>

<P>OPPOSITE to this <HI>Nunnery,</HI> on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Street, is an <HI>an|cient Building</HI> with a large <HI>Gate,</HI> which has formerly been a Piece of &s;tately Workman&s;hip. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">De rebus Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE> This Sir <HI>Robert Shaftoe,</HI> Recorder of this Town, was of Opinion, was the Hou&s;e of the Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and was cal|led the <HI>Earls Inn.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Divi&s;ion of this Street.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING now got as far as the End of the broad Part of this Street, we have the Breadth of it divided into <HI>Three Streets.</HI> The fir&s;t <HI>Street,</HI> or that on the Right Hand, is called the <HI>Meal-market,</HI> the <HI>Oatmeal-market,</HI> or <HI>Groat-mar|ket,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Oatmeal,</HI> which is &s;old there every Day of the Week, but more e&s;pecially on the <HI>Saturday</HI>'s. What Name it had formerly, or whether it ever had any other, I cannot &s;ay; but this is certain, that it has re|tained it's pre&s;ent Name above <HI>two hundred Years.</HI></P>
<P>AT the Upper-end of this Street, or the North-end of it, is the <HI>Po&s;t-hou&s;e</HI> of this Town, which is adorned with a pretty <HI>Area</HI> of a <HI>Quadrangular Figure,</HI> together with a good Garden: It belongs to Mr. <HI>James Bell,</HI> the pre&s;ent Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>AS you de&s;cend from this End of the Street, you turn the Corner of this Hou&s;e upon the Right Hand, into a Lane called the <HI>Pudding-chare,</HI> or as I have &s;een it in &s;ome ancient Writings <HI>Budding-chare,</HI> which leads into <HI>We&s;t|gate.</HI> There were three Hou&s;es in this Lane which paid an Annual Rent to the Chantry of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church; one paid 20 <HI>d. per Ann.</HI> another 2 <HI>d.</HI> and the third 4 <HI>d.</HI> The Lane called <HI>Ro&s;emary-lane,</HI> which turns upon the Right Hand as you go down this Chare into <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> was former|ly called St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Chare;</HI> becau&s;e it led from the <HI>Pudding-chare</HI> to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church.</P>
<P>IN this Lane there is a <HI>Wa&s;te,</HI> which belong'd to the Nuns of St. <HI>Bartholo|mew,</HI> boundering on the We&s;t on the Common Gutter, and on the North on the Chantery Lands.</P>
<P>THIS Wa&s;te is the Ground where are now the Gardens of Mr. <HI>James Bell,</HI> Po&s;t-ma&s;ter, and the old Hou&s;es on the North of the&s;e Gardens, now the Property of Mr. <HI>Ralph Trotter,</HI> are the <HI>Chantery Lands</HI> here mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="64">OVER again&s;t the South-end of this Lane, which &s;o leads to St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church, is an ancient Alms-hou&s;e, in which live &s;even poor People, who have a &s;mall Allowance at Chri&s;tmas from the Town.</P>
<P>HAVING pa&s;t the Ea&s;t-end of the <HI>Pudding-chare,</HI> we go Southward, which leads into the Body of the <HI>Meal-market,</HI> afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>THERE is little in this Street worth taking Notice of; the Hou&s;es ge|nerally are very ancient and mean, the few good ones are one which was built the la&s;t Year by Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> of this Town, Cooper, an ancient Inhabitant in this Street; and another the Hou&s;e below it, which belongs to Mr. <HI>William Harri&s;on,</HI> Dyer, which was formerly the Dwelling-hou&s;e of <HI>Timothy Rob&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Alderman of this Town, and &s;ometime Mayor; and &s;ome few others.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a Hou&s;e in this Street belonging to one <HI>William Penrith,</HI> who&s;e Site is now lo&s;t, paid an annual Rent to the Chante|ry of our Lady in the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Long-benton.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom.

But where the Site of it is he does not &s;ay.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the lower end of this Street is a large open, where is a <HI>Mar|ket</HI> every Saturday for <HI>Wool,</HI> below this again a Lane leading into <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> called <HI>Denton-chare.</HI></P>
<P>PASSING by the Ea&s;t-end of this Chare, we come to the ancient <HI>Iron-Mar|ket,</HI> which was oppo&s;ite to St. <HI>Nicholas Church,</HI> in that Piece of Ground lead|ing to the Side, from the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark,</HI> and from below the Shop of the late Mr. <HI>John Kellot,</HI> Smith.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Street which the broad Street of the <HI>Big-market</HI> is divided in|to is the <HI>Middle-&s;treet,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e it &s;tands in the Middle of the Streets in this Part of the Town; for it has on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it the <HI>Fle&s;h-market</HI> and <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet,</HI> and on the We&s;t, the <HI>Oatmeal-Market,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tgate.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Street bore anciently three Names, the upper Part of it was called <HI>Skinner-gate,</HI> the lower Part of it <HI>Spurrier-gate</HI> and <HI>Sadler-gate.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Street as it was in <HI>Grey</HI>'s Time, where all Sorts of Artificers have Shops and Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>WE come now to the 3d Street, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Fle&s;h-market,</HI> at the upper-end of which is the <HI>Upper-dean-bridge,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e of the two Bridges which cro&s;s this Dean or Rivulet, which runs into <HI>Lorkburne,</HI> this is that which is the higher or upper one.</P>
<P>HAVING pa&s;&s;ed by the We&s;t-end of this Bridge we go Southward into the <HI>Fle&s;h-market.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> tells us, <Q>that when the Good-men of this Town began to trade and venture beyond the Seas, they built many Ships, and procured a Char|ter from the Kings of <HI>England</HI> to carry Fells beyond Seas, and to bring in foreign Commodities. The Staple was then at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> called <HI>Commune totius Europae Emporium.</HI> The <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Merchant Adventurers</HI> was the fir&s;t Charter that was granted by any King to any Town.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AFTER this Grant this Town flouri&s;hed in trading, built many fair Hou&s;es in the <HI>Fle&s;h-market,</HI> then called <HI>Cloth-market.</HI> The Merchants had
<PB N="54" REF="65">
their Shops and Ware-hou&s;es there, in the Back-parts of their Hou&s;es: The River of <HI>Tyne</HI> flowed and ebbed, where Boats came up with Commodities; which Trade of Merchandizes continued many Years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN this Street the Mayors, Aldermen, and riche&s;t Men of the Town lived.</Q></P>
<P>PART of the pre&s;ent <HI>Fle&s;h-market</HI> was called the <HI>Cloth-market,</HI> and part of it the <HI>Fle&s;h-market</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;h-market.</HI> An Anonymous Authority &s;ays, that in <HI>Pil|grim-&s;treet</HI> was the Market for <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> that came up to the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge.</HI> But this in my Opinion is a Mi&s;take. For in the Ward belonging to <HI>Mor|den-Tower,</HI> part of it is over the <HI>Fle&s;h-&s;hambles</HI> from the North We&s;t Church Stile of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> unto the <HI>Fi&s;h-&s;hambles.</HI> Con&s;equently the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> that came up to the <HI>Nether-dean-bridge</HI> mu&s;t have been &s;old in the <HI>Fle&s;h-market,</HI> not in <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet.</HI> The Shops of this Street are at pre&s;ent the Shops of Artificers, and the Hou&s;es either chiefly Coffee-hou&s;es or Taverns, or Ale-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome ancient Writings belonging to that worthy Gentleman <HI>The Rev. Mr.</HI> Smith <HI>of</HI> Mel&s;onby, I find that &s;everal Hou&s;es in this Street paid an an|nual Rent to <HI>Univer&s;ity College</HI> in <HI>Oxford;</HI> one of them in particular nigh the Church Yard paid 6 <HI>s.</HI> in the Year 1304, and &s;o did many Hou&s;es in the o|ther Streets of this Town to the &s;ame <HI>College.</HI> Several of the&s;e were the Gift of the Lady <HI>Ann Bella&s;ys</HI> to this College, <HI>An.</HI> 1444.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fle&s;h-market</HI> in this Street, which is held every Saturday, is a very great Market, not only as it &s;upplies the Town in a great Mea&s;ure, but as it al&s;o furni&s;hes the Country for &s;everal Miles round.

<P>THE Provi&s;ion al&s;o for <HI>Ships,</HI> is got from this Market. And this indeed mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable, when there will be &s;ometimes 3 or 4 hundred Sail in at a Time.</P>
<P>THERE are 2 <HI>Fairs</HI> kept in this Market every Year for 8 Days together, the one begins upon <HI>Lammas</HI> Day, or the Fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which <HI>Grey</HI> calls <HI>a remarkable Time of the Year,</HI> but why he calls it &s;o, he gives no Account. This Fair is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure of an ancient &s;tanding. For we meet with &s;ome Account of it in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> mentioned in a Charter of another of our Kings. The Words are the&s;e, <HI>In&s;uper cum Dicti Burgen&s;es per Chartam praefati Joannis Regis habeant in dicto Burgo unam feriam &s;ingulis annis per duos dies duraturam,</HI> viz. <HI>in vigilia &amp; in die Sancti Petri ad Vincula, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>NOW from this it appears that King <HI>John</HI> granted to the Town of <HI>New|ca&s;tle, Lammas</HI> Fair, which he order'd &s;hould be held on the Eve of St. <HI>Peter ad Vincula,</HI> and upon the Day it &s;elf. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Blount in Verb.</NOTE> I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Grey</HI> calls it a remark|able Time of the Year, as well becau&s;e it is called <HI>Lammas</HI> Day as becau&s;e it is called St. <HI>Peter advincula.</HI> As it is <HI>Lammas</HI> Day, it is a remarkable Time of the Year, for it is called <HI>Lambmas</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Lambs</HI> were not then fit to eat, they were grown too big: <HI>aliter</HI> from the <HI>Sax.</HI> III <HI>asmaesse <HI>q. d. Loaf|mas,</HI></HI> becau&s;e on that Day the Engli&s;h made an Offering of Bread made with <HI>new Wheat.</HI> On this Day it was, that Tenants that held Lands of the Cathe|dral Church of <HI>York</HI> (which is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter ad Vincula</HI>) were bound by their Tenure to bring a <HI>Live Lamb</HI> into the Church at <HI>High-ma&s;s</HI> on that Day.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o a remarkable Time, as it is St. <HI>Peter ad vincula,</HI> and as it is called the <HI>Gule</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> from the Latin <HI>Gula,</HI> a Throat. The Rea&s;on is &s;et down in <HI>Durand</HI>'s <HI>Rationale</HI> (<HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 19.) who &s;ays, that one <HI>Quirinus,</HI> a <HI>Tribune,</HI> hav|ing a Daughter that had a Di&s;ea&s;e in her Throat, went to <HI>Alexander,</HI> then Pope
<PB N="55" REF="66">
of <HI>Rome,</HI> the 6th from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and de&s;ired of him to borrow, or to &s;ee the <HI>Chains,</HI> that St. <HI>Peter</HI> was chained with under <HI>Nero;</HI> which being obtained, the &s;aid Daughter ki&s;&s;ing the Chains, was cured of her De&s;ea&s;e, and <HI>Quirinus</HI> with his Family baptized. <HI>Tunc dictus</HI> Alexander <HI>Papa hoc Fe&s;tum in Calendis augu&s;ti celebrandum in&s;tituit, &amp; in honorem beati</HI> Petri <HI>Eccle&s;iam in Urbe Fabrica|vit, ubi vincula ip&s;a repo&s;uit, &amp; ad Vincula nominavit, &amp; in calendis augu&s;ti dedi|cavit. In qua, Fe&s;tivitate Populus illic ip&s;a vincula hodie O&s;culatur.</HI> So that this Day being before called only the Calends of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> was upon this Occa&s;ion termed indifferently either St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Day <HI>ad Vincula,</HI> from the In&s;trument that wrought the Miracle; or the Gule of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> from that Part of the Virgin whereon the Miracle was wrought. <HI>Blount in verb.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this Fair granted by King <HI>John,</HI> it was by a &s;ucceeding King, or|dered to begin at the &s;ame Time, and to continue 28 Days. When it was reduced to the Time above-mentioned I have not met with.</P>
<P>THE other Fair held in this Market is at St. <HI>Luke&s;mas,</HI> it was granted to the Town in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th. During the Time of the&s;e Fairs there is a Court of <HI>Pye-powder.</HI> All the Privileges and Power that a Court Leet can have, is granted to this Court. <HI>Grey</HI> 17.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the South-end of this was a large <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> with a lead Ci&s;tern at the Top of it to hold the Water, called the <HI>New-water;</HI> which was pulled down about 3 Years ago. Beyond this, at the End of this Street is the <HI>Cor|diners Meeting-hou&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>Steeple</HI> of this Church is in Height 64 Yards, one Foot, three Quar|ters. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, as to it's Model, to be the mo&s;t curious in the whole Kingdom: It is adorned with 13 <HI>Pinacles,</HI> and a large and beautiful <HI>Lanthorn,</HI> which &s;tands upon two very bold Arches of Stone, and at the Top of the &s;aid <HI>Lanthorn</HI> &s;tands the tall <HI>Spire,</HI> by much the large&s;t belonging to the <HI>Stee|ple.</HI> On the Corners of the old <HI>Tower,</HI> upon which &s;tands the &s;aid beautiful Structure, are four <HI>Images,</HI> one at each Corner, cut at length in Stone. 'Tis &s;aid that <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> the Poet, made the following Lines upon it.</P>

<P>IT is &s;aid, and indeed confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was more probably the Builder of this <HI>Steeple</HI> than any other Per&s;on: His Name being at the Bottom of the <HI>Bel&s;ry.</HI></P>
<Q>Orate pro anima <HI>Roberti Rhodes.</HI></Q>
<P>BUT who this <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was, is more uncertain. <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that <HI>Ro|bert de Rhodes</HI> was the Lord Prior of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th Days. And an <HI>Anoymous Authority</HI> &s;eems to &s;ugge&s;t, that this <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was one of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI>'s Ju&s;tices; becau&s;e in a Regi&s;ter at <HI>Durham,</HI> there is mention made of <HI>Robert Rhodes, ab Anno</HI> 1486, <HI>ad An'</HI> 1537, and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife.</P>
<P>BUT neither of the&s;e &s;eem to me to be the true one. I am rather inclina|ble to believe, that one <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who lived in this Town in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th was the true Per&s;on. We meet with this Gentleman's Name in an Inqui&s;ition that was taken at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the 25th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, 1447; for two of the Gentlemen pre&s;ent were <HI>Roger Thorn|ton,</HI> the Son of the famous Benefactor of that Name, and <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> and they were al&s;o fir&s;t mentioned after the Mayor.</P>
<P><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Lib. de Reb. 11.</NOTE>IN the Year 1451, we meet again with the &s;ame Per&s;on, who together with the &s;aid <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> by an In&s;trument bearing the &s;ame Date, con|veyed &s;ome Hou&s;es for the U&s;e of a <HI>Chantery Prie&s;t</HI> to pray for the Soul of
<PB N="58" REF="69">
<HI>William John&s;on.</HI> We have al&s;o a further Account of this Gentleman in the Year 1500, for an In&s;trument bearing that Date informs us, that the <HI>Mayor</HI> and Inhabitants of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> gave a Tenement to a Prie&s;t to live in, who was to pray for the Soul of <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, at the Altar of St. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, and <HI>John</HI> the Evangeli&s;t in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church.</P>
<P>NOW when it is con&s;idered that this <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> I am &s;peaking of, was &s;o great a Man in this Town, that he lived in the &s;ame Reign in which <HI>Grey</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Lanthorne</HI> to have been built, namely in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6th, and that he was &s;o commemorated by the <HI>Mayor</HI> and Inhabitants af|ter his Decea&s;e, I dare &s;ay it will appear much more probable that he was the Builder than either of the others.</P>
<P>THERE might indeed be, and probably there was a <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> Prior of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6th, but I never met with any Bene|factions of the Priors of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> to the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> They were on the contrary mortal Enemies to this Place, and always jealous of it's encrea&s;|ing Glory. As to the other <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> one of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s <HI>Ju&s;tices,</HI> he was alive in the Year 1537, which was the 29th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, and &s;o comes too late to build a Steeple in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th. I have been told by a worthy Gentleman, and one who is curious in the&s;e Things, that this <HI>Robert Rhodes,</HI> &s;o taken Notice of by this Town, was <HI>E&s;cheator.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a traditional Story of this Building I am now treating of, which may not be improper to be here taken Notice of. In the Time of the Civil Wars, when the <HI>Scots</HI> had be&s;ieg'd the Town for &s;everal Weeks, and were &s;till as far as at fir&s;t from taking it, the General &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the May|or or of the Town, and demanded the Keys, and the Delivering up of the Town, or he would immediately demoli&s;h the <HI>Steeple</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Mayor and Aldermen upon hearing this, immediately ordered a certain Number of the chiefe&s;t of the Scotti&s;h Pri&s;oners to be carried up to the Top of the old <HI>Tower,</HI> the Place below the <HI>Lanthorne,</HI> and there confined; after this they returned the <HI>General</HI> an An&s;wer to this Purpo&s;e, That they would upon no Terms de|liver up the Town, but would to the la&s;t Moment defend it: That the <HI>Steeple</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was indeed a beautiful and magnificent Piece of Architecture, and one of the great Ornaments of their Town; but yet &s;hould be blown into Attoms before ran&s;om'd at &s;uch a Rate: That however, if it was to fall, it &s;hould not fall alone; that the &s;ame Moment he de&s;troyed the beautiful Structure, he &s;hould Bath his Hands in the Blood of his Countrymen; who were placed there on Purpo&s;e either to pre&s;erve it from Ruin, or to die along with it. This Me&s;&s;age had the de&s;ired Effect. The Men were there kept Pri&s;oners during the whole Time of the Siege, and not &s;o much as one Gun fired again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THERE were only five Bells originally belonging to this Church, but of late Years the Number is encreas'd to Eight. The great Bell, call'd the com|mon Bell, was &s;ent to <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> to be new ca&s;t in the Year 1615, it weighed 3129 lb. They are very large ones, have a bold and noble Sound, and yet exceedingly &s;weet and Harmonious. The three latter Bells were given to this Church by the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1723, <HI>William Elli&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mayor, and <HI>Robert Sowersby,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sheriff, the <HI>Steeple</HI> was repaired at the Expence of the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>AT the North Door of this Church, it is ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>large Flagg</HI> which is the fir&s;t Step into the Church, is cut all along the Surface with <HI>un|even Lines,</HI> in Imitation of the Waves of the Sea. This is a &s;ilent Remem|brancer of the <HI>Saint</HI> the Church is dedicated to; for St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Myra,</HI> who lived in the Time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, is &s;o famous among &s;ome for his Miracles and Apparitions by Sea, that he has merited the Title of the <HI>Patron of the Sailors.</HI></P>

This Gentleman died about the 6th or 7th of the Reign now mentioned, as is clearly gathered from the Authority above; and the Letters in which this Chantery is mentioned bear Date the 6th of this Reign: and therefore it is a Mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e this Chantery founded in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, which was almo&s;t an hundred Years after.</P>
<P>THE Prie&s;ts &s;et a-part to attend this Altar, were every Day to pray for his Soul, and the others above-mentioned; and by an Order from the Then <HI>Ri|chard,</HI> Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> the Chaplains for the Time being, were obli|ged on the <HI>Anniver&s;ary Day</HI> of his Death, every Year for Ever, to celebrate his Memory with a <HI>Solemn tolling of the Bells,</HI> and <HI>devoutly &s;inging by Note</HI> in the <HI>Evening of the Anniver&s;ary,</HI> and on the <HI>Anniver&s;ary it&s;elf,</HI> and &s;olemnly to &s;ing Ma&s;s for the Soul of <HI>Richard</HI> him&s;elf, and the Souls above-mentioned, and the Souls of all the Faithful departed. And after Ma&s;s, one of the Chaplains was to di&s;tribute among <HI>an hundred and &s;ixty poor People,</HI> the Sum of Six Shillings and Eight-pence, and this annually for ever. This, together with &s;everal o|ther Things, was ordered by <HI>Richard,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the 3d Year of his Con&s;ecration, <HI>Anno</HI> 1335, which was, with all other Things mentioned in the Charter, confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, in the 10th Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>THUS then it appears that this Chantery is of a much older Date than the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth. But this is not all; <HI>Richard de Emeldon,</HI> was but a &s;econd Founder of this Chantery: It boa&s;ts &s;till an higher Antiquity, and is &s;aid to have been founded by <HI>Laurence</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> who was Prior of <HI>Durham</HI> in the Year 1149, which, by the way, is a further Proof of our Conjecture of this Church's being founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, or in that Reign at late&s;t.</P>

<P>IN this North Part of the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was a Shrine of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who in the 4th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th was Lieutenant of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and being commanded by the King to levy tho&s;e Monies which were then extorted from the Country to carry on the War of <HI>Britany;</HI> the Vulgar conceiving him to be the Cau&s;e of that Task, tumultuou&s;ly murdered him at <HI>Cockledge,</HI> near <HI>Threske,</HI> eighteen Miles north of <HI>York,</HI> upon the Day of St. <HI>Vitalis</HI> the Martyr; whereupon he was buried at <HI>Beverley,</HI> where he hath a &s;tately Monument, but much defaced. This is Shrine at pre&s;ent much more &s;o, being no where to be met with; bul <HI>Grey</HI> tells us, that in this Part of the Church there was &s;uch a Monument in his Time, that was made in Memory of him in his own Country; he having a Hou&s;e in this Town and Pari&s;h, and that Part of the In&s;cription upon it was, <HI>Orate pro anima Hemici Percy</HI> 4 <HI>Northumbriae qui per Rebbelium Manus occabuit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Milbank</HI> Manu&s;cript &s;ays it was in the north Corner of the Church: That it was a Monument of Wood; on which was painted an <HI>old Man,</HI> our <HI>Saviour</HI> on his right Hand, and the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> on his Left. There came a Labil from her Mouth, but what it was this Authority had forgot; but that from our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s was <HI>Quae&s;o Patri &s;ac, qued rog it mea Mater.</HI></P>
<P>THEN followed &s;ome Latin Ver&s;es, done in the rhiming Way of the Monks, but they are &s;o dark and ob&s;cure, that little can be made of them. the Manu&s;cript goes on; When Mr. <HI>William Selby</HI> was buried, this Monu|ment was removed out of that Corner, and Sir <HI>George Selby</HI> did &s;et his mag|nificent Tomb there. Alter that it was placed again&s;t the Wall, next to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Tomb, and &s;o continued 'till Mr. <HI>Lane. Hod&s;hon</HI> got leave of Vicar <HI>Nailor</HI> to remove it and place his Father. Where it is now I know not.</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Vicarage</HI> is reckoned 150 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and the Corporation makes an annual Addition of 90 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to it, which was granted by this generous and worthy Body, that the Vicar might live in a more plentiful and ho&s;pitable Manner than he could otherwi&s;e do.

<P>IN the Year 1724, the upper Clerk of this Church dy'd (for it had been the Cu&s;tom to have two) Upon which it was thought more beneficial to the Pari&s;h to have an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the <HI>Curate,</HI> which was accordingly done in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> the &s;ame Year.

<P>THIS Situation is al&s;o confirmed by the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manu&s;cript which &s;ays, that this Fryery was near to <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet-gate,</HI> and that there is a little Lane be|tween it and the Walls, wherein there is an <HI>Alms-hou&s;e;</HI> but now both the Fryery and it are converted to private U&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>JOHN Scotus</HI> alias <HI>Duns,</HI> or <HI>Duns Scotus;</HI> there was much Controver&s;y whether he was an Engli&s;h-Man, a Scot, or an Iri&s;h-Man. He was a Man of a mean Fortune, of a Wit made for Learning, and wonderful Subtle and Sharp. When he had &s;tudied &s;ome Years with great Advantage at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he returned into <HI>Northumberland,</HI> his native Country, as &s;ome will have it, and took upon him the Habit of St. <HI>Francis</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> Being afterwards &s;ent to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he again fell to his Studies with great Vehemency, 'till he ar|rived to be Doctor and Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity. Thus he 1&s;t expounded the Ma&s;ter of Sentences at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and afterwards, in the Year 1304, being ap|pointed Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Paris,</HI> by the General of the Order, in the Chapter in <HI>Toulou&s;e,</HI> he there taught a Cour&s;e of Divinity.

All the followers of <HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> af|firm'd, that &s;he was; <HI>Scotus</HI> and his Adherents po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted the contrary. Here it was that he gained the Title of Dr. <HI>Subtilis;</HI> he publi&s;h'd a Lecture on <HI>Gene&s;is. Commentaries on the Go&s;pels</HI> in 4 Books. Several Books on the Epi|&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Sermons of Saints, and of Particular Times. Two or three Pieces on the Ma&s;ter of Sentences. Quodlibets.

<P>HE dy'd mi&s;erably, 1309, being taken with an Apoplectick Fit, and too ha&s;tily buried: For, Nature having too late wrought through the Di&s;temper, he vainly mourn'd for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, 'till, at la&s;t, beating his Head again&s;t the Tomb-&s;tone, he da&s;h'd out his Brains, and &s;o expir'd.

<P>THE Authority above &s;ays al&s;o, that it is a Princely Hou&s;e, and indeed it is no le&s;s than very &s;tately and magnificent; being &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;o of any Hou&s;e in the whole Kingdom, within a walled Town.

<P>BUT this Hou&s;e is not more remarkable or memorable, upon any Account, than for it's having been the Lodgings of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, whil&s;t he was Pri&s;oner at this Town.</P>

For</HI> Hugh <HI>&s;ignifies a</HI> Steep-Hill, <HI>or</HI> Bank, <HI>and</HI> Painter <HI>is a Term made u&s;e of by the</HI> Sailors <HI>for a</HI> Rope, <HI>which they fa&s;ten the Boat with. This Street therefore was called the</HI> Painter-Hugh, <HI>becau&s;e it was the</HI> Hugh <HI>which the</HI> Painters <HI>were made fa&s;t to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ONE</HI> William Porter <HI>had a Hou&s;e at the End of this Street, which he granted to</HI> John de Chambers, <HI>a Burge&s;s of this Town, in the Reign of King</HI> Edward <HI>the Third,</HI> Anno <HI>1361, on Condition that he paid to the</HI> Priore&s;s <HI>and Convent of</HI> Lambly, <HI>eighteen Shillings</HI> per Annum.</P>
<P><HI>THE other Lane or Street, on the Ea&s;t of this Street, is</HI> Silver-&s;treet, <HI>clo&s;e by the North-&s;ide of</HI> All-hallows Church-yard; <HI>it leads into</HI> Pandon. <HI>It is &s;aid, but very improbably, to have got it's Name of</HI> Silver-&s;treet, <HI>becau&s;e of the</HI> Fi&s;h-market, <HI>which was kept a little below it, at the</HI> Stock-Bridge. <HI>It was anciently called</HI> All-Hallowgate, <HI>for</HI> All-Hallowgate <HI>is &s;aid to be</HI> Ex parte Boreali Eccle&s;iae omnium Sanctorum; <HI>it was al&s;o called</HI> Temple-gate. <HI>Mr.</HI> Nicholas Lamb, <HI>who&s;e Hou&s;e is in this Street, finds it called</HI> Jewgate, <HI>in his Writings; but when, or for what Rea&s;on it bore that Name, I know not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE come now to the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> All-Hallows, <HI>which &s;tands a little below</HI> Silver-&s;treet, <HI>and on the &s;ame Side of the Street with it,</HI> viz. <HI>at the very Bot|tom of this</HI> Pilgrim-&s;treet.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IV. <HI>Of</HI> ALL-HALLOWS CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>WHO this Church was founded by, I have met with no Account, nor any of the Time it was built in; only this is certain, it mu&s;t have been built before the Year 1286, but how long before, I know not. For in that Year I meet with an Account of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> P. 245.</NOTE> the <HI>Church-yard</HI> of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> which is a plain Proof that the Church was then in Being.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> is of Opinion that it was dedicated to <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> or <HI>All-Saints,</HI> from the ancient Name of that Part of the <HI>Town Pampedon,</HI> which he &s;ays was &s;o called from <GAP DESC="foreign">; imagining, I &s;uppo&s;e, that it was &s;o cal|led
<PB N="89" REF="100">
of the <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All-Hallows <HI>Church.</HI></NOTE> (who inhabited this Part of the Town) after the <HI>Temple</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> which was dedicated to <HI>all the Gods.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Church is &s;eated upon a Hill, which is much about the &s;ame Height with the Situation of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>Gate&s;head,</HI> and upon the &s;ame Line with it.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;o long as St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> being only 55 Yards, one Foot, a Quar|ter long; but it is broader, as being 25 Yards, two Foot broad. The <HI>Steeple</HI> is but or a mean Height, being a Square Tower, with only one <HI>Spire</HI> ari&s;ing from it. The Bells belonging to this Church were founded in the Year 1696. They were ca&s;t out of the Metal of that famous <HI>Statue</HI> of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, which &s;tood on the <HI>Sand-Hill.</HI> They were founded in the Ground belonging to St. <HI>Au&s;tin Fryers,</HI> in that Part of it, which is in the Back-&s;ide of the <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> of the <HI>Holy Je&s;us.</HI> Their Sound is not &s;o Melodious as the o|thers in this Town, but the Note is exceedingly exact, and more tuneful than the others.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> did to this <HI>Steeple,</HI> his Name is under the Bel|fry of it, as at St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> In one of the Regi&s;ters belonging to this Church of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> we have the following Account. About the <HI>Round</HI> where the Bells are drawn up into the Bell-hou&s;e in the <HI>Steeple,</HI> there is written, <HI>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</HI> His <HI>Arms</HI> are al&s;o without, at the Ea&s;t-end of the Church, on the <HI>Brea&s;t</HI> of an <HI>Angel;</HI> which, as I take it, is a <HI>Tyger,</HI> or <HI>Grey-hound</HI> on a <HI>Chief,</HI> and <HI>three Annulets</HI> on the <HI>E&s;cutcheon.</HI> The like is in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In St. <HI>John</HI>'s al&s;o, on the Out-&s;ide of the <HI>South Porch,</HI> over-again&s;t the <HI>Alms-hou&s;e,</HI> there is on a Square, <HI>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</HI> I have al&s;o &s;een the &s;ame in <HI>Tinmouth Ca&s;tle</HI> in a <HI>Round,</HI> on the North-&s;ide, after you are within the Gate, upon the <HI>Wall;</HI> which be-like was in &s;ome Part of that great <HI>Church,</HI> when it was a <HI>Cell</HI> of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s.</P>
<P>UPON the Ea&s;t-end of the <HI>Chancel,</HI> in the South-ea&s;t Window, there was the Picture of our Saviour at large, but in the Time of the <HI>Rebellion</HI> it was wholly taken away.</P>
<P>NEXT to it, as you go up the South-&s;ide; there was the Picture of a <HI>Boy</HI> &s;tanding upon chequer'd Pavement, as it &s;eemed, and on the Gla&s;s under him,
<Q><L>Like as the <HI>Jamen</HI> moi&s;t and cold,</L>
<L>Is full of Tempe&s;t Day by Day,</L>
<L>So is one Child of ten Years old,</L>
<L>Hath no Under&s;tanding, but all on Play.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Authority adds, I &s;uppo&s;e the re&s;t of the Months were al&s;o in this Window in former Times, but I have &s;een it only; and it was taken a|way al&s;o in the Time of the Rebellion.</P>
<P>IN the Window above the South Door, which leads into the Quire, to|wards the Porch, were the Pictures of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI>'s Children, <HI>Two Men</HI> and <HI>Three Women</HI> Kneeling at Altars. There remain now only <HI>Two</HI> of the Women.</P>
<P>THERE are higher up this I&s;le, in the Windows towards the Porch &s;ome Characters, one is like an (I) with an (S) through it, and other <HI>Three Chara|cters,</HI> which are the Merchants <HI>Skin-mark,</HI> for they are but a little Different from the <HI>Skin-mark,</HI> which is upon the Stone of <HI>Chri&s;topher Elmer.</HI> It is a Token that &s;ome Merchant was a Benefactor to the Church, and perhaps &s;ome Part of the South Wall of the Church: I take it to be the <HI>Skin-mark</HI> of <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> for the very &s;ame is in the <HI>Chantery</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> over-again&s;t his Tomb.</P>
<P>TRADITION &s;ays, that from the We&s;t-end of the Ve&s;try to the Porch, the old South Wall was taken away, and rebuilt further into the Church-yard
<PB N="90" REF="101">
by <HI>Roger de Thornton.</HI> That the old Wall was farther into the Church than the Wall now is, is plain from the Piece of it now remaining, which is on the Ea&s;t-end of the <HI>Ve&s;try;</HI> and I think the Pictures in the Windows a|bove-mentioned, is a good Confirmation of the Truth of the Tradition of the Builder. In that Window next the Porch Door, but one, there have been the Pictures of the <HI>Twelve Apo&s;tles.</HI> There are now only remaining St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> the Le&s;s, St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Philip,</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> Major, and another.</P>
<P>THERE are three Galleries in this Church, one on the We&s;t-end, and, another on the Ea&s;t-end of the Nave, and the other in the North-I&s;le. That on the We&s;t-end was built in the Year 1712. The <HI>Organ</HI> which was plac'd in the middle of it was built at the &s;ame Time. It is a very long Gallery, and by much the mo&s;t beautiful in the Church. On the North-end of it are the Seats of the Children belonging to the <HI>Charity-School.</HI> The Gallery on the We&s;t-end, is called the <HI>Butchers Gallery.</HI></P>
<P>THE other Gallery on the North-I&s;le is the <HI>Sailors Gallery.</HI> It is &s;aid in a Memorandum made at the Bottom of it, to have been <HI>built and fini&s;hed by the</HI> Trinity-hou&s;e <HI>in</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>in the Year</HI> 1618, John Holbourne <HI>then Ma&s;ter.</HI> It was beautified in the Year 1720, <HI>Robert Bailiff</HI> being then Ma|&s;ter, with three or four Devices on the South-&s;ide of it. One Pannel has the Picture of <HI>St.</HI> Paul<HI>'s Shipwreck;</HI> another, our <HI>Saviour's being a&s;leep in the Storm;</HI> then there is the Arms of the <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e;</HI> another Draught is that of our Saviour's taking <HI>Peter by the Hand when he was &s;inking in the Waves;</HI> and the other is that of <HI>Jonah vomited up upon the dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Chancel</HI> of this Church &s;tands upon a large <HI>Vault,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>pretty long Entrance, arched at the Top,</HI> and of a <HI>pretty large Square Room, with a curious Pillar in it,</HI> which is the grand Support of eight large <HI>Stone Arches.</HI> The Entrance into this <HI>vault</HI> is in the <HI>Church-yard,</HI> on the <HI>North-&s;ide</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AS you enter into the <HI>Chancel</HI> from the <HI>Nave</HI> of the Church, you have on the left Hand of you, an <HI>old Pair of Stairs,</HI> to which are adjoining the <HI>Stairs</HI> of the <HI>Butchers Gallery:</HI> The&s;e <HI>Stairs</HI> formerly led into the &s;ame Place, but then it was into a <HI>Gallery</HI> different from what the <HI>Butchers Gallery</HI> is now. They led into a <HI>Loft</HI> or <HI>Gallery</HI> called the <HI>Rood Loft.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Rood</HI> was an Image of our Saviour upon the Cro&s;s, made generally of <HI>Wood,</HI> and placed on a <HI>Loft</HI> made for that Purpo&s;e, ju&s;t over the Pa&s;&s;age out of the <HI>Church</HI> into the <HI>Chancel;</HI> out of this My&s;tery, they &s;ay, that the <HI>Church</HI> repre&s;ents the <HI>Church Militant,</HI> and the <HI>Chancel</HI> the <HI>Church Triumphant;</HI> and who will pa&s;s out of the Former into the Latter, mu&s;t go under the <HI>Rood Loft,</HI> that is, they mu&s;t go under the <HI>Cro&s;s, and &s;uffer Affliction.</HI> This <HI>Image</HI> was wont to have the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> on one Side of it, and St. <HI>John</HI> on the o|ther. <HI>Stavely, C. Hi&s;t. P.</HI> 199.</P>
<P>A few Years ago the <HI>Chancel</HI> was beautifyed. It is pannel'd round with Wain&s;cot. The Table is a large curious <HI>Marble Stone,</HI> which was given to the Church for that U&s;e by an unknown Hand. On the large Pannel, im|mediately above the <HI>Altar,</HI> is this Figure; <Q>I. _H. S.</Q> or, <HI>Je&s;us Hominum Salvator:</HI> Above that again is the Picture of a <HI>Dove,</HI> cu|riou&s;ly carved in <HI>Wood;</HI> and above that again, in a <HI>Golden Glory,</HI> is the great Name of God <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifies his mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;elf Exi&s;tence: <HI>He was, and is, and is to come.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is to point out, by way of Emblem, the Per&s;ons of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> God the Father, by the Word <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> he having order'd <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when
<PB N="91" REF="102">

<P>ON the Top of the Ea&s;t-end of the Altar, above the Things now menti|oned, are the Repre&s;entations of <HI>Three large Candles,</HI> which are an Emblem of the <HI>Light of the</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vid.

He conjectures it to be the burial Place of <HI>Robert Rhodes;</HI> becau&s;e of the Words <HI>Promotor Eccle&s;iarum,</HI> lib. <HI>All-Hall'.</HI> The Words <HI>Promotor Eccle&s;iarum</HI> are not now to be found. How|ever, had they been there &s;till, I think they are but a weak Argument to prove that <HI>Robert Rhodes</HI> was buried here, when it is con&s;idered that he founded a Chantery in St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that his own Soul, and his Wife's might be prayed for. For People were generally buried in the &s;ame Church, and near the very Place, where they erected a Chantery or an Altar.</P>
<P>BUT whoever it is, this I think may be &s;afely concluded from the Gran|deur of the <HI>Grave Stone,</HI> that he was &s;ome wealthy Per&s;on; and from his be|ing <HI>Promotor Eccle&s;iarum,</HI> that he was al&s;o Religious.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Effigies</HI> is very Tall, and is &s;urrounded with very curious Pictures of the Saints, and &s;ome other Things; but the Bra&s;s is now tearing off, and going very fa&s;t into Ruin. It is a pity it &s;hould not have more care taken of it, as it is an Ornament to the Church, and the Monument of it's Benefactor. The <HI>Promoters</HI> of <HI>Churches</HI> &s;hould be always remember'd with the mo&s;t grate|ful Re&s;pect, that they may be &s;hining Lights to the mo&s;t di&s;tant Ages.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the Monuments of this Church with an Epitaph, &s;aid to have been made upon <HI>Robert Wallas,</HI> formerly Clerk of this Church.</P>
<Q><L>Here lies <HI>Robin Wallas,</HI></L>
<L>The King of good Fellows;</L>
<L>Clark of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI></L>
<L>And a Maker of Bellows:</L>

<P>THERE are 41 Boys taught to read, write, and ca&s;t Accounts, by <HI>John Davenport,</HI> the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter: And 17 Girls are taught to read, knit, &s;ew, make, and mend their own Cloaths, by <HI>Hannah John&s;on,</HI> the pre&s;ent Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE Children have Coats and Caps once a Year, and Shoes, Stock|ings, Shirts, and Bands twice a Year: And at their leaving the School, they have Forty Shillings each to put them out Apprentice, or equip them for Services, and each of them a Bible, with the Common-Prayer, a Whole Duty of Man, and <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Catechi&s;m.</P>
<P>THE Magi&s;trates of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> gave a Room, wherein the Girls are taught, and contributed towards Building a Gallery in <HI>All-Saints</HI> Church for the Chil|dren, and likewi&s;e gave Ground, whereon to build a School for the Boys, and a Hou&s;e for the Ma&s;ter: The Charge of which was defrayed out of &s;e|veral Legacies left to the School.</P>
<P>TWO Hundred Thirty Four Boys and Girls have been in all put out &s;ince the School was &s;et up.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1728, &s;ome Gentlemen of this Pari&s;h founded a Lecture by Sub&s;cription, for the In&s;truction of the People in the <HI>Rubrick</HI> and <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church. It was &s;ettled upon <HI>Henry Bourne,</HI> the Curate of this Church, and was opened on <HI>Low-Sunday</HI> the &s;aid Year. It is held every other Sunday in the Summer at 6-o'Clock in the Evening, and continues from <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> 'till the Sunday after <HI>Holy-Cro&s;s,</HI> or the 14th of <HI>September.</HI></P>

It was formerly the Cu&s;tom to have two Clerks for this Church. But in the Year 1708, it was thought more convenient for the Pari&s;h, and le&s;s Burthen&s;ome to the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> (who had one of the large&s;t Cures in the Kingdom to manage) to have an A&s;&s;i&s;tant; accordingly <HI>Abraham Wil|cox,</HI> M.

<P>THERE are other two Clergymen belonging to this Church, which are Lecturers, and paid by the Town; the one for Preaching in the Morning has 100 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and the other for Preaching in the Afternoon 100 <HI>l. per An|num.</HI></P>

<P>THERE are Prayers at this Church every Day at 10-o'Clock in the Mor|ning, and 4 in the Afternoon. The Sacrament is admini&s;tred at this Church every &s;econd Sunday in the Month. It was formerly u&s;ual for the Town to pre&s;ent this Church, at the <HI>High Fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter,</HI> with twenty one Gallons of Wine.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the <HI>We&s;t Stairs</HI> of this Church is an <HI>Alms-Hou&s;e,</HI> which was in good Repair, as we are informed by the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manu&s;cript, about 100 Years ago, at which Time the <HI>Church-Wardens</HI> allowed them 20 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> for Coals for four Women. It is now in very bad Repair, and go|ing fa&s;t into Ruins. At pre&s;ent the People in it, are allowed eight Chaldron of Coals <HI>per Annum,</HI> and three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter by the Church-wardens.</P>
<P>ON the <HI>South-&s;ide</HI> of this Church are two Pair of Stairs; tho&s;e oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Quire-Door</HI> lead into a narrow Street called the <HI>Dog-bank;</HI> but former|ly, as appears by &s;ome ancient Writings, <HI>Silver-&s;treet:</HI> The other Pair lead into the <HI>Butcher-Bank,</HI> which is a narrow Street, and a great De&s;cent. It is mo&s;tly inhabited by <HI>Butchers,</HI> who have their Shops and Hou&s;es there. In this are many narrow Lanes called <HI>Chares,</HI> which lead into the <HI>Key-&s;ide.</HI> This leads into the Street called the <HI>Side,</HI> and into the <HI>Sand-hill.</HI> It was called formerly <HI>All-Hallows Bank.</HI></P>

<P>_IN order now to go regularly down into the lower Parts of the Town, let us &s;et off from the South-&s;ide of the Steeple of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which leads dire|ctly to the Top of the Street called the <HI>Side.</HI> Whil&s;t I am here I can't help ob&s;erving, that were the Hou|&s;es belonging to Mr. <HI>Partis,</HI> &amp;c. which are &s;ituated from the Porch Door of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to the &s;aid Street, taken away, the Belfry and Steeple would look much more grand and magnificent; and whereas this <HI>Great Ornament</HI> of the Town is now almo&s;t hid as a Traveller comes up this Street, it would then be wholly expos'd, and &s;trike the Beholders with Awe and Wonder.</P>
<P>AFTER you have cro&s;&s;ed the upper Part of this Street, there is a Pa&s;&s;age leading to <HI>Bailiff-Gate,</HI> which has a Turn upon the Left-hand, that goes into the <HI>Ca&s;tle-yard,</HI> the Place where is &s;ituated the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> of this Town.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="121">BEFORE the Conque&s;t the old <HI>Round Tower</HI> was probably in Being, and was the <HI>old Ca&s;tle,</HI> or <HI>Fort</HI> of <HI>Monkche&s;ter;</HI> and after the Conque&s;t, when the other Ca&s;tle was built, it was called, (to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the <HI>old Ca&s;tle</HI>) the <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which in a &s;mall Time after gave Name to the whole Place. Some|thing to this Purpo&s;e are the&s;e two or three Words about it, in the Manu|&s;cript of <HI>John Milbank,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>That this new Ca&s;tle may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the old one.</HI> The U&s;e of this Tower, as the &s;ame Authority informs us, was made to &s;ecure the <HI>Pa&s;s</HI> to the <HI>Bridge</HI> in former Times.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>new Ca&s;tle</HI> was built by <HI>Robert Curthois,</HI> the Son of <HI>William</HI> the Con|queror in the Year 1080 as has been before ob&s;erved. But notwith&s;tanding this, and that it gives a new Name to the Place, yet whatever Priviledges be|longed to <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> (for &s;o the Town was then called) continued with it, nor did the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> impair them in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">De reb.

<P>THE fir&s;t Account we meet with of it after it was built, is of it's being be|&s;ieged by <HI>William Rufus.</HI> For <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> having oppo&s;ed him, he came down and laid Siege to the Ca&s;tle, and con|quer'd <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> upon which <HI>Robert</HI> fled, and ab&s;conded in <HI>Bamburgh-Ca&s;tle;</HI> but was afterwards taken by the King's Party, and carried Pri&s;oner to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG &s;everal Rents and Revenues ari&s;ing to this Ca&s;tle, the following were &s;ome.</P>

She married into the Family of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>D' Arcy,</HI> and transferr'd this Manour of <HI>Hadde&s;ton</HI> and divers others into that Family. Lord <HI>D' Arcy</HI> abovementioned, dy'd po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this Manour at <HI>Nor|ton</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> 30th <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. In the 1&s;t of <HI>Hen. IV.

This Family is &s;o named from <HI>Lomley</HI> a Town &s;ituated on the Bank of the River <HI>Were,</HI> where their Seat was. They are de&s;cended from <HI>Liulph,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Nobility in the Time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, who married <HI>Algitha</HI> the Daugh|ter of <HI>Aldred,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Sir <HI>George Lumley,</HI> Knight, he that married the Grand-daughter of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> of this Town, was in great repute in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, being High Sheriff in the 2d of that Reign; in the 6th, Knight of the Shire; in the Year <HI>8,</HI> High Sheriff again, in which Office he continued three Years more.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Che&s;ter on the Street,</HI> &s;ays, he &s;uppo&s;es it to have been the <HI>Condercum,</HI> where <HI>upon the Line of the Wall,</HI> the fir&s;t Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the A&s;tures kept Garri&s;on in the <HI>Roman</HI> Times, as the <HI>Notitia</HI> tells us. And this he conje&s;tures, becau&s;e in the <HI>Saxon, Che&s;tre</HI> is called <HI>Concester,</HI> and becau&s;e it is but a few Miles from the Wall. But others are of Opinion, that <HI>Benwall,</HI> a Village about two Miles We&s;t of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> was the ancient <HI>Condercum,</HI> becau&s;e of the Antiquity of the Place, and its Nearne&s;s to the Wall; the <HI>Notitia</HI> de&s;cribed the <HI>Condercum,</HI> as upon the <HI>Line of the Wall.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed &s;eems rather probable.

<P>In this Village were lately found &s;everal <HI>Mens</HI> with <HI>Coins</HI> in them, which were mo&s;t of them broken and &s;quander'd about by the ignorant Diggers; but one of them being pre&s;erved, was given to the Library at <HI>Dur|ham,</HI> where it remains very intire.</P>

This Manour is now the Property of <HI>Robert Law&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Chirton.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Crawlington,</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Heaton</HI> is a &s;mall Village di&s;tant from <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> about a Mile and a Half Ea&s;tward. It has been handed down by Tradition to the pre&s;ent Day, that it was a Place of Retreat for King <HI>John</HI> when he came into this Country, and there are &s;till to be &s;een the Ruines of an <HI>ancient Building,</HI> now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which carries the Name of <HI>King</HI> John<HI>'s Palace.</HI> Whatever Truth there may be in this Tradition, this is certain, that there is in the &s;aid <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s Ground on the <HI>North-&s;ide</HI> of this old Building, the Remains of a Fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture, was built for the Safety and Security of this Hou&s;e, and con|&s;equently this Hou&s;e mu&s;t have been of &s;ome great Di&s;tinction. And when it is further con&s;idered, that this Village of <HI>Heaton</HI> is a Part of the <HI>Barony of</HI> Robert de <HI>Gaugy,</HI> it may not be improbable to conclude, that this ancient Building has in &s;ome Mea&s;ure been what Tradition &s;ays it was. For <HI>Robert de Gaugy</HI> was a great Man in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and was entru&s;ted by him (as has ju&s;t now been ob&s;erved) with the Government of divers Ca&s;tles at Times, to defend them again&s;t the <HI>rebellious Barons,</HI> which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage; for in the 3d of <HI>Henry III.</HI> it was certified, that the Barony of this <HI>Robert</HI> in this Coun|ty, con&s;i&s;ted of this and the other Manours, which he held of the King by the Service of <HI>Three Knights Fees.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Robert</HI> therefore might have had his own Hou&s;e here upon this Part of his Barony; and as he was &s;o faithful a &s;ervant to King <HI>John,</HI> and entru&s;ted by him with Matters of &s;uch great Concern, it is not impro|bable but when the King came to the&s;e Parts, he lodged at this Hou&s;e; and this perhaps was the Rea&s;on of its getting the Name it hears at this Day.</P>
<P>This is its ancient Grandeur; its pre&s;ent is, the Hou&s;e and Family of the worthy Gentleman above mentioned; it was built in the Year <HI>1713,</HI> it is a beautiful Hou&s;e, and &s;o &s;ituated, that on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> it overlooks the <HI>Town-Moor, Fenham,</HI> and Part of the Lands of the Prior of <HI>Tinmouth;</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> it faces the <HI>Sheilds Road;</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> it has a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect to the Windings of the <HI>Ou&s;e-Burn,</HI> of its Woods and Banks, and of the Villages &s;ituated on it. On the South it faces the River <HI>Tine.</HI> Its Conveniencies and Beauties a|bout it, are on the We&s;t-&s;ide a <HI>Fi&s;h-Pond, Groves, Wilderne&s;s, Gardens, Avenues,</HI> and Numbers of Plan|tations. On the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> a very large and beauteous Quadrangle, who&s;e Walls are &s;haded with the choice&s;t Fruit-Trees, and who&s;e <HI>Area</HI> is adorn'd with Variety of <HI>Knots</HI> and <HI>Flowers.</HI> In this <HI>Area,</HI> at a due Di&s;tance, are two <HI>Images</HI> tall as the Life, which declare the Hand of a curious <HI>Statuary.</HI> On the <HI>North</HI> are Gardens and Plantations, and on the <HI>South</HI> an <HI>Area</HI> Adorned with Images and a plea&s;ing Gravel-Walk, be&s;et with Trees and bordered with Flowers.</P>
<P>This Gentleman the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was elde&s;t Son to <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was born at <HI>Hardriding,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Haltwhi&s;tle,</HI> the ancient Man&s;ion-hou&s;e of the Family of the <HI>Ridleys;</HI> where is &s;till to be &s;een above one of the old Doors, the Date of the Year of its Building, which was earlier than the Conque&s;t, and the initial Letters of the Name of the Builder, <HI>N.

<P>This <HI>Nicholas</HI> was of the younger Branch of the <HI>Ridleys</HI> of <HI>Wilmotes-Wike;</HI> the Seat as Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> &s;ays, of the <HI>wor&s;hipful Family of the Ridleys,</HI> which is a pretty large <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Tine,</HI> and very ancient, as appears from &s;everal Things about it.</P>
<P>A little above this, upon the Banks of the <HI>Tine,</HI> is the E&s;tate of Mr. <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> the younger Son of the &s;aid Gentleman.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Senior, was <HI>twice Mayor of</HI> Newca&s;tle, in the Year <HI>1688,</HI> and in the Year <HI>1706,</HI> and was e&s;teemed a Man of great Honour and Integrity, and an excellent Magi&s;trare. By his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament, dated 7th <HI>December 1710,</HI> he gave and bequeathed to the Poor of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Haltwhi&s;tle 40</HI> s. <HI>per annum,</HI> out of a little Farm or Tenement called <HI>Waggtail</HI>-Hall. He al&s;o gave a Rent-Charge of 4 <HI>l.</HI> and <HI>10 s. per an|num</HI> to the Poor of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> and <HI>50 l.</HI> to the Poor of the City of <HI>Carli&s;le.</HI> Which &s;aid Charities he order'd to be di&s;tributed every Year to the more aged and infirm, eight Days before <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> He left al&s;o <HI>20 l.</HI> to the Poor of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Hexham.</HI> He died <HI>January</HI> 22d <HI>1710,</HI> and hes buried in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in this Town, at the Entrance into the <HI>Chancel</HI> from the Body of the Church.</P>
<P>Of this younger Branch was <HI>John Ridley</HI> of <HI>Hardriding,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was <HI>Major</HI> of a Regiment in the Army of the right Honourable <HI>William</HI> Marquis of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> for the Service of King <HI>Charles I.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Gentlemen of this Family already mentioned, we &s;hall only take Notice of the two Per&s;ons following.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and then Bi&s;hop of <HI>London.</HI> He was born here, and being edu|cated in Grammar at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and in academical Learning in both <HI>Univer&s;ities,</HI> where he took his Doctor's Degree, was fir&s;t made Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pembroke-Hall</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> then Chaplain to King <HI>Edward VI.</HI> and at length Bi&s;hop.

<P>This <HI>Robert</HI> being con&s;tituted Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Fore&s;ts in <HI>Derby, Cumberland,</HI> this County, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had free Warren granted him in all his Deme&s;ne Lands here, and divers others of his Manours in this County. <HI>36 Hen.

of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Garth;</HI> as in other Parts of the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>AN Inqui&s;ition in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I. &s;ays, that the ancient <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> be|longing to the King, &s;ituated within the Walls of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> be|longs to the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and is &s;urrounded with a great Stone-Wall. That below the Ca&s;tle there is a great <HI>Hall,</HI> where the County of <HI>Northumberland</HI> holds their A&s;&s;izes. There is al&s;o a great <HI>Tower,</HI> full of Chinks, under which are two Vaults, which are the Places where the Pri|&s;oners of the County of <HI>Northumberland</HI> are kept, which are within the Circuit of the Ca&s;tle it&s;elf.</P>
<P>AND that there is in Being the exterior Wall of the Ca&s;tle, which begins North of the Ca&s;tle, about &s;ix Yards from the <HI>Great Gate,</HI> which leads into the <HI>Ca&s;tle-yard;</HI> and &s;o goes on ea&s;tward and &s;outhward by the Back of &s;ome Hou&s;es in the <HI>Side.</HI> Then it goes we&s;tward by the Back of &s;ome Hou&s;es in the <HI>Sand-hill;</HI> then it cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Ca&s;tle-&s;tairs,</HI> which lead to the Street called the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> and from thence behind the Hou&s;es, even to the upper <HI>Pinion-Ga|vel</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>James Clavering</HI> Alderman, which is about nine Yards di&s;tant from the long Stairs, where the &s;aid ancient Wall, on account of its Decay, does no farther appear; but yet the Bounds and Limits of the Ca&s;tle go through the middle Part of a Hou&s;e, extending it&s;elf even to the Channel in the long Stairs. Then it goes along the Channel upwards on the Out&s;ide of the new Wall, which was built to enclo&s;e the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">The high and great Heap, <HI>viz.</HI> the Dunghill on the We&s;t|&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, was taken away by Sir <HI>John Marley</HI> Mayor, and his Adhe|rents, to ram|part the Town-Walls again&s;t the Parliament and Com|monwealth,</NOTE> Dunghill. From thence it goes to the Corner of the Hou&s;e of  <GAP DESC="blank">  and thence by the Back-part of the Hou&s;e of  <GAP DESC="blank">  where the ancient outward Wall begins. This ancient outward Wall of the Ca&s;tle contains by Mea&s;ure three Acres of Ground and one Rood.</P>
<P>IN the 18th of this King's Reign, another Inqui&s;ition was held at <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> about the Ca&s;tle, wherein Complaint was made of the <HI>Dunghill</HI> men|tioned in the Bounds of the Ca&s;tle, that it had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a Bigne&s;s, that it was in Length 98 Yards, the Depth of it was 10 Yards, and the Breadth of it 32 Yards; which being &s;uch a prodigious Weight upon the Wall on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle (which Wall was in Length 40 Yards, in Height 10 Yards, in Breadth 2 Yards) that a great Part of it is intirely thrown down and &s;ubverted to the great Detriment of the Strength of the Ca&s;tle. The Damage was computed at 120 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>IT was al&s;o by this &s;ame Inqui&s;ition complained of, that the great &s;quare Tower was full of Chinks and Crannies; and that one Third of it was almo&s;t taken away: That all the Lead and Covering which it had of old was im|bezled and carried of, in&s;omuch that the Pri&s;oners of the County of <HI>Northum|berland</HI> were mo&s;t mi&s;erably lodged, by rea&s;on of the Showers of Rain falling upon them. They computed the Charge of repairing it would be 809 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 0 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been a Building of great Strength, and no little Beauty; the va&s;t Thickne&s;s of the Walls &s;peaks the one, and the Ruines of &s;ome curious Workman&s;hip &s;peaks the other. The grand Entrance into the Ca&s;tle was at the Gate facing the South, which leads up a Pair of Stairs (which &s;till &s;hew the Magnificence of the Builder) to a very &s;tately Door of curious Ma&s;onry. The Room this leads into, has its Floor broken down clo&s;e to the Ca&s;tle-Wall, as indeed all the other Floors are to the Top of the Ca&s;tle; &s;o that ex|cepting the Floor above the County-Goal, there is not one left, tho' there have been five Divi&s;ions or Stories of the Ca&s;tle be&s;ides this. This floored Room which I was told was lately flagg'd by the Order of <HI>William Elli&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Alderman, when he was la&s;t Mayor in the Year 1723, &s;eems to me without any Doubt, to have been the <HI>common Hall</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, becau&s;e on the North-&s;ide of the &s;ame Room there is an Entrance by a De&s;cent of &s;ome Steps into a Room, where is the large&s;t Fire-place I &s;aw in the Ca&s;tle, which plainly &s;peaks it to have been the Kitchen. At the End of this there are &s;e|veral
<PB N="120" REF="131">
Stairs, which lead into a Place under the Kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the Bottom of the Ca&s;tle. This I take to have been a Cel|lar, as I do al&s;o that little <HI>dark Place</HI> on the right Hand coming up again, to have been a Sort of a Pauntry.</P>
<P>THE Door I mentioned ju&s;t now on the Ea&s;t of the Ca&s;tle, which leads to the fir&s;t broken down Floor, is becau&s;e of it's Grandeur and Beauty, an Argument that this Room has been the mo&s;t &s;tately one in the whole Ca&s;tle; another Rea&s;on for it's being &s;o, is becau&s;e of the Windows which gave Light into it. Tho&s;e of them that face the Ea&s;t are the mo&s;t beautiful of the whole Ca&s;tle; be&s;ides, on the South of this Room there is an Entrance into a Sort of a Parlour or withdrawing-Room, which has a Fire Place in it; which has been a Piece of curious Workman&s;hip, as is vi&s;ible to this Day; and this Place has no Communication with any Part of the Ca&s;tle but this Room. On the North-&s;ide of this Room, is a Door leading into an Apartment, where &s;tands a Well of a con&s;iderable Depth, it was 18 Yards before we touch'd the Surface of the Water; which &s;eems to have been placed there on purpo&s;e for the more immediate Service of <HI>this Room:</HI> There are &s;ome little Ba&s;ons on the Top of the <HI>Well,</HI> with Pipes leading from them, which conveyed Water to different Appartments of the Ca&s;tle; This is plain from what may be ob&s;er|ved in the <HI>County Goal,</HI> at the Bottom of the Ca&s;tle; the round &s;tone Pillar in it, having an Hollow in the Middle, of a Foot wide, with a lead Spout in the Side of it.</P>
<P>IN the Inqui&s;ition made in the 9th of <HI>Edward</HI> 3d abovementioned, among other Things that were complained of for being neglected, one was <HI>Capella Do|mini Regis infra Ca&s;trum.</HI> This Chapel I have been told, &s;tood on that Part of the Ca&s;tle Yard, where the Moot-hall is; but upon Searching, I found it in the Ca&s;tle it&s;elf according to the Account of it ju&s;t now mentioned. The Door of it is at the Bottom of the South Wall of the Ca&s;tle, adjoining to the Stairs which lead into the State Chamber. It has been a Work of great Beau|ty and Ornament, and is &s;till in the mid&s;t of Du&s;t and Darkne&s;s, by far the mo&s;t beautiful Place in the whole Building; the In&s;ide of it being curiou&s;ly adorned with Arches and Pillars. It is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve the different Parts of it, the <HI>Entrance,</HI> the <HI>Body of it,</HI> and the <HI>Chancel;</HI> on the left Side of the En|trance you go into a dark little Room, which undoubtedly was the Ve&s;try. The full Length of it is 15 Yards, the Breadth of it is 6 Yards and half. It had 3 or 4 Windows towards the Ea&s;t, which are now all filled up, nor is there any Light but what comes in at a little Cranny in the Wall.</P>

And as he goes on, the Con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle, when that Office is &s;ettled, may ap|point the learned Stewards to keep Courts, and then the Officers for the &s;aid Ca&s;tle will be compleat. Be&s;ides the Rents above-mentioned, a great Num|ber of Hou&s;es, Yards, and Gardens paid to it.</P>
<P>IN the 17th of <HI>James</HI> I. 1619, a Grant was made of the Scite and De|me&s;nes of the Ca&s;tle to <HI>Alexander Stephen&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was &s;ucceeded by one <HI>Patrick Black,</HI> who died, and left it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Wife. After that one <HI>James Langton,</HI> Gent. claimed <HI>Patrick Black</HI>'s Right, but by Virtue of what is not known.</P>

<P><PB N="121" REF="132">IT is reported, that underneath that Hou&s;e which was anciently the Coun|ty Goal, is a <HI>Vault</HI> which leads to the Ca&s;tle. There is indeed a large Door &s;till to be &s;een, which perhaps was the Entrance into it; and Mr. <HI>George Grey,</HI> the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Hou&s;e, told me that it was certainly &s;o, be|cau&s;e he had put down thro' his own Floor a Bailiff's Rod to the very End, and could find no Bottom.</P>
<P>A Manu&s;cript I have often had Occa&s;ion to mention gives us the following Account of the Ca&s;tle-Yard.</P>
<P>THE Way thro' the Yard begins at the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Yate,</HI> and when I was young, there was no Hou&s;es in it but the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Thomas Southern,</HI> and the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Green;</HI> the&s;e Hou&s;es were near the Gate before you came into the Ca|&s;tle-yard; and there was in the Garth a Hou&s;e, wherein the <HI>Goaler</HI> of the Ca|&s;tle dwelt, and a Hou&s;e wherein <HI>William Robin&s;on</HI> dwelt, who was Deputy Herrald under <HI>Norroy, King at Arms.</HI> This Man wrote in a Book the Arms of all the Mayors of this Town, from <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> until his Time. And when I was Chamberlain of the Town, which was about the Time of Sir <HI>Nicholas Cole</HI>'s being Mayor in the Year 1640, it was then in the Town's Chamber; when <HI>Trollop</HI> built the <HI>Town-Court,</HI> he borrow'd it, but would ne|ver re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Hou&s;es at that Time; but &s;ince then Mr. <HI>Bulmer,</HI> he took a Garth behind his Hou&s;e in the <HI>Side,</HI> and built a Stable in it, and had a Garden in it; and al&s;o <HI>George Hayroy</HI> took from thence to the <HI>Moat-hall,</HI> and built Hou&s;es upon it: He was a Butcher, but not a Freeman, and the&s;e took their Lands and Hou&s;es of <HI>Alexander Stephen&s;on,</HI> a Scotti&s;h Man, who came in with King <HI>James,</HI> for he begg'd the Ca&s;tle of the King. He was one of his Clo&s;e-Stool. This Man began to build the Ca&s;tle-Gate, but it was fini&s;hed by one <HI>John Pickle,</HI> who made it in the Fa&s;hion it is now, and kept a Tavern in it; and then one <HI>Jordan</HI> a Scot&s;man and <HI>Sword-Kipper,</HI> built the Hou&s;e on the South-&s;ide of the Gate, and lived in it; and <HI>Thomas Reed,</HI> a Scotch Pedlar, took a Shop in the North-&s;ide of the Gate.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent there are a good many Shops and Hou&s;es belonging to it, in and about it.</P>

<P>_THIS Street is from the Head of it, to the <HI>Stairs</HI> on the left Hand, a very great de&s;cent, and lies narrow, untill you come to the middle of it, from which Place it opens in a &s;pacious Breadth, and &s;o continues to the <HI>Sandhill.</HI> It is from the one end to the other fill'd with Shops of <HI>Merchants, Gold&s;miths, Milliners, Uphol|&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c. The Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this Street, from the Upper Part of it to <HI>All-hallow Pant,</HI> was called <HI>Cordiner,</HI> or <HI>Cordwainer Rawe.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE the middle of the Street are Stairs leading up to the Ca&s;tle-yard, which was the Ea&s;tern-Po&s;tern of the Ca&s;tle, and after called the Wa&s;te of <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> as appears from the Account of <HI>Gunner Tower;</HI> and our Towns-man, <HI>Grey,</HI> &s;ays, that in the Middle of this Street is an antient <HI>Stone-Hou&s;e,</HI> an Appendix to the Ca&s;tle, which in former Times belonged to the Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> before the Ca&s;tle was built, or at lea&s;t coetany with the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>ON the other Side of this Street, oppo&s;ite to the Wa&s;te now mentioned, is a <HI>Corner Shop,</HI> which formerly belong'd to a Chantery in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Church. On the &s;ame Side of this Street, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to this Ea&s;tern-Po&s;tern of the Ca&s;tle, is a &s;hort narrow Lane, (which formerly &s;eems to have gone by the Name of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Vide Gun|ner-Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Swinburn-place</HI>) which leads by Stairs into a dark narrow Lane which faces the <HI>Painter Heugh</HI> that leads into <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet.</HI> On the North|end of this Lane there was a Place called <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vide Gun|ner-Tower.</NOTE> <HI>Pencher Place,</HI> perhaps the whole Lane was called &s;o.

<P>WE come now to the <HI>Cale-Cro&s;s,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e of the <HI>Cale</HI> or <HI>Broth</HI> which was &s;old there in former Times.

<P>THIS Building, as to its Form and Model, is of great Beauty, and withal very &s;umptuous. That Part of it, which is the <HI>Court</HI> it&s;elf, is a very &s;tately <HI>Hall,</HI> who&s;e lofty Cicling is adorn'd with various Painting, and its Floor laid with checker'd Marble. On the <HI>Ea&s;t end</HI> of it is a Dial, and the Entrance into the <HI>Merchants Court.</HI> On the We&s;t are the <HI>Benches,</HI> where the Magi|&s;trates &s;it, rai&s;ed con&s;iderably above the Floor of the <HI>Court,</HI> above which are the Pictures of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. large as the Life. On the North a Gallery for Spectators; and on the South the Windows, which are very pretty, particularly that Window which is a <HI>Katharine-Wheel,</HI> in which is a large Sun-dial of painted Gla&s;s, with this Motto, <HI>Eheu Fugaces!</HI> Under this is a large <HI>Balcony,</HI> which overlooks the River. Here it is that the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Sheriff</HI> keep their Courts, and the Judges at <HI>Lammas</HI> hold the A&s;&s;ize. Here is kept the <HI>Guilds,</HI> the Court of <HI>Admiralty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ON the North-&s;ide of this <HI>Hall</HI> is a magnificent Entrance into a Pa&s;&s;age, which leads into a large Room called the <HI>Town's Chamber.</HI> Here it is that the <HI>Mayor</HI> tran&s;acts the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Town. Here the Common Council is held, where the <HI>Mayor</HI> &s;its on a Bench di&s;tingui&s;hable from the others, the Aldermen on each Side of him, the Common Council below upon Chairs placed on each Side the Room, and &s;eparated from the Benches, as the Court it&s;elf is &s;eparated from the Benches there. And here upon the Days of <HI>Rejoicing,</HI> the <HI>State Holidays,</HI> the Mayor not long ago entertained the <HI>Ma|gi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Burge&s;&s;es</HI> with a Banquet of Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which they were wont to come from the <HI>Mayor</HI>'s <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> with great Pomp and Solemnity.

<P><PB N="126" REF="137">BEFORE I leave this Street, I mu&s;t by no Means omit the Effigies of King <HI>James</HI> II. which &s;tood here, as I have been told, on that Side of the Bull-ring next the Court-&s;tairs. By the Account I have had (for I never &s;aw the Statue it&s;elf, nor the Picture of it) it mu&s;t have been a very curious Work. The King's Picture on Hor&s;eback was ca&s;t in <HI>Copper</HI> large as the Life; the Hor&s;e &s;tood upon his Hind-Feet, rai&s;ed upon a Pede&s;tal of <HI>white Marble,</HI> which was &s;urrounded with <HI>Iron-Pales.</HI> It co&s;t the Town 1700 <HI>l.</HI> and was confe&s;s'd the mo&s;t beautiful and curious of its Kind that was in the whole Kingdom. Certainly it was a great Ornament to the Town, and 'tis therefore great Pity it is not &s;till in Being, tho' it was the Statue of an un|fortunate King. But there is no Bounds to the heady Proceedings of a fu|rious Mob; it drives all before it, without either Rea&s;on or Reflection, and bears no Regard to Things either Civil or religious. Such a one I am told was this, that pull'd down the <HI>noble Statue;</HI> a few Soldiers, as drunk with Loyalty as with Liquor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bu&s;y hot-headed Genius of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> having provided Ropes for that Purpo&s;e, pull'd it down, dragg'd it from thence to the <HI>Key,</HI> and threw it into the <HI>River.</HI> This was in the Year 1688; it was afterwards taken up again, and Part of it ca&s;t into a Set of Bells, which now belong to <HI>All-Hallows</HI> in this Town.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>The</HI> CLOSE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the Ea&s;t of this Street is the Entrance to the <HI>Key-&s;ide,</HI> which &s;hall be &s;poken hereafter. On the <HI>We&s;t</HI> is the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> to which as you go along, you pa&s;s by the <HI>North-&s;ide of the Chapel of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>the Martyr;</HI> and on the other Side oppo&s;ite to this <HI>Chapel,</HI> an ancient Hou&s;e which is &s;aid to be built by <HI>Richard de Emmeldon,</HI> Mayor of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> for three Prie&s;ts to pray for his Soul. I take it to be nigh tho&s;e Stairs which lead up to the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> the ancient outward Fortification.</P>
<P>FROM hence going on &s;till We&s;tward, you cro&s;s over the North-end of the <HI>Tine-bridge,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;s into the Street called the <HI>Clo&s;s.</HI> It an&s;wers its Name exactly well, for it is but narrow and clo&s;e too. It was formerly that Part of the Town where the principal Inhabitants liv'd, Sir <HI>John Marly,</HI> Sir <HI>William Blacket,</HI> Sir <HI>Mark Milbank;</HI> and the Hou&s;es of many other Gentle|men of Figure are &s;till remembred by the ancient Inhabitants. And indeed however the Street it&s;elf may be, however mean the Fronts of the Hou&s;es are, within they &s;peak Magnificence and Grandeur, the Rooms being very large and &s;tately, and for the mo&s;t Part adorn'd with curious <HI>Carving.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Hou&s;e was in this Street; it was that Hou&s;e which has at its Entrance a <HI>great Gate,</HI> be&s;ides which there is a large round Ball of Stone, the Hou&s;e on this Side Mr. <HI>Thorp Stewart</HI>'s. In the lower Part of this Building, towards the Water, are very manife&s;t Tokens of its Antiquity</P>
<P>OF late Years the&s;e Hou&s;es have been for&s;aken, and their wealthier Inha|bitants have cho&s;en the higher Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>ON the right Hand as you enter the Street from the <HI>Tine-Bridge,</HI> are Stairs which lead into the <HI>Ca&s;tle-yard,</HI> which were the <HI>Southern Po&s;tern</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, and are called the <HI>Ca&s;tle-&s;tairs.</HI> On the &s;ame Side a little further along, are <HI>other Stairs,</HI> which are called the <HI>Long Stairs,</HI> which lead up to the <HI>Bailiff-Gate, Backraw, Ca&s;tle-yard, Side,</HI> &amp;c. almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to which is a &s;mall

<HI>Key,</HI> called <HI>Javel-Gripp.</HI> Somewhat further along are <HI>other Stairs</HI> on the &s;ame Side of the Street, leading to <HI>We&s;t-gate,</HI> which are called <HI>Tudhill-Stairs.</HI> Perhaps it is not ami&s;s to tell you what I have been &s;omewhere inform'd of, that the pro|per Name of it &s;hould be <HI>Tout-hill,</HI> from the touting or winding of a Horn upon it, when an Enemy was at Hand. What makes me the more incline|able to believe this Tradition to be true, is, that Cornage was paid to the Ca&s;tle, as may be &s;een in our Account of it. Now <HI>Cornage</HI> comes from the Word <HI>Cornagium,</HI> (from <HI>Cornu</HI> a Horn) and was a Kind of grand Serjeanty: The Service of which Tenure was to blow a Horn, when any Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Scots</HI> was perceived; and by this many Men held their Land Northward, a|bout the <HI>Picts Wall. Cambd. Britan.</HI> 609 Pag. and <HI>Littleton,</HI> Fol. 35.</P>
<P>ALMOST oppo&s;ite to the&s;e Stairs is the Hou&s;e of the Mayors of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> where they re&s;ide during the Year of their Mayoralty. It is a Build|ing grand and &s;tately; and con&s;idering the Place it &s;tands in, is very orna|mental. As the Mayors of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> have &s;uch continual Bu&s;ine&s;s at Court, tho' the Situation is not &s;o plea&s;ing as that of the upper Part of the Town, it is yet more advantageous, as it is nigher the Court.</P>
<P>BEYOND this Hou&s;e a little Way, &s;till going on We&s;tward, is the Gate belonging to this Street, called the <HI>Clo&s;e-Gate.</HI> The Town-wall de&s;cends from the <HI>We&s;t-Friar Tower,</HI> down a dangerous Pair of Stairs, upon a very &s;teep Bank, to this Gate, from which it goes Southward to the Water-&s;ide, where is an old Tower, now the Hall of the Sail-makers.</P>
<P>WITHOUT this <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> Gate is a Way to the <HI>Forth,</HI> a Place of Recreation.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> were many Hou&s;es, which pay an annual Rent to the Ma&s;ter and Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the Virgin.</P>
<P>THIS Street is commemorated in many ancient Writings for a Mill, which (in ancient Times, long before the&s;e were drawn) was wont to &s;tand upon the <HI>Hoga,</HI> that is, upon the <HI>Bank</HI> without the <HI>Clo&s;e-Gate.</HI> In a Grant from the Ma&s;ter and Brethren of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>We&s;t-gate,</HI> it is permitted to the Parties concern'd, that they have <HI>quandam placeam terrae in Vico quoe voca|tur</HI> le Clo&s;s, <HI>&s;icut &s;e extendit in longitudine de Hoga, ubi</HI> antiquum molidinum <HI>&s;olebat &s;tare, u&s;que ad aquam</HI> Tinae, &amp; <HI>quantum de</HI> Tina <HI>acquirere poterit.</HI></P>

<P>IN coming into the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> we cro&s;s'd the End of the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>The Bridge is of great Antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the Times of the</HI> Romans. <HI>There mu&s;t have been a Communication between this and the other Side of the River; and therefore there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for it.

And it is the common Opinion, that there has been a military Way from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> this Way tends towards the Place where the Bridge now is. There mu&s;t then have been a Bridge in the <HI>Roman</HI> Times over the River <HI>Tine,</HI> near the Place where the pre&s;ent Bridge &s;tands.</P></NOTE> <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge, let us now return and con&s;ider it a little. It has been a Query, whether the Bridge was originally of Wood or Stone; but I think it is altogether need|le&s;s; all the Bridges in <HI>England</HI> were originally of Wood. In the Reign of
<PB N="128" REF="139">
<HI>Richard</HI> I. <HI>Philip</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> &s;ent to the Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Gate-Side</HI> a Grant of <HI>Fore&s;tage,</HI> in which are the&s;e Words: <HI>And it &s;hall be lawful for every Bur|ge&s;s to give Wood to whom&s;oever he will, to be &s;pent about the River of</HI> Tine, <HI>without any Licence.</HI> This I imagine has been for the building of Keys, and e&s;pecially for the repairing of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s Part of the Bridge, which is a fur|ther Proof, that this Bridge, which was the original one, was <HI>Wood.</HI> But what I think puts it beyond Di&s;pute, is, that according to <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> it was burnt in the Year 1248, together with a great Part of the Town.</P>
<P>AFTER this Misfortune hapned, the Town, who repairs two Thirds of the Bridge, and the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas Ruthall,</HI> Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Dur|ham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry VII.</HI> built or re|pair'd the third Part of the Bridge o|ver the River <HI>Tine,</HI> to|ward the South. <HI>Good|win.</HI></NOTE> Bi&s;hop the other, laid out their Endeavours to rai&s;e up another Bridge of <HI>Stone.</HI> Accordingly the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> &s;ent out Indul|gences, and the Town procured other Bi&s;hops to do the &s;ame, to all tho&s;e that would a&s;&s;i&s;t either with Money or Labour in the erecting of it. By which Means they got &s;uch a Sum as was &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>THE Archdeacon of <HI>Northumberland</HI> wrote to the Clergy of his Archdea|conry, and de&s;ired them to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Work of the <HI>Bridge</HI> as much as they could, telling them, their venerable Father the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> by his Letters Patents, had commanded them without any Let or Delay, to go about the Affair of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and that they were to prefer the Epi&s;copal Indulgences to others. And what aro&s;e from them was to be given to the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Bridge,</HI> who was then <HI>Laurentius,</HI> for the U&s;e of the Bridge. <HI>Lib. Cart.</HI></P>
<P>IN like Manner the Official of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> promi&s;ed an Indulgence of 10 Days to any one, that would a&s;&s;i&s;t the repairing of <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge.</P>
<P><HI>WALTER</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> on the 8th of the Ides of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1277, granted an <HI>Indulgence of</HI> 20 <HI>Days</HI> to all that be&s;towed Part of the Sub&s;tance GOD had given them, to the repairing of the <HI>Tine</HI>-Bridge, or would a&s;&s;i&s;t the repairing of it, by working at it with their own Hands.</P>
<P>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that <HI>William</HI> St. <HI>Barbara</HI> &s;ent the following Indul|gence; but that can't be, for he liv'd a great while before the Bridge was built.

<P>THE pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter is the Rev. Dr. <HI>Thomlin&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Chapel was lately beautified and Pewed, and on Sunday the 10th of <HI>September</HI> 1732, (the whole Body of the Magi&s;trates coming to it with the u&s;ual Solemnities and Formalities) was &s;et apart by the Corporation for a Chapel of Ea&s;e to the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Sermon in the Morning was preached by the Rev.

<P>A little beyond this is a large and &s;trong Building, which <HI>Grey</HI> informs us, was built a little before the Writing of his Hi&s;tory, upon an Arch of the Bridge, and u&s;ed for a <HI>Magazine</HI> for the Town. Under this are the Shops of <HI>Francis Rud&s;ton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Alderman, and Mr. <HI>William Sorsby.</HI> There is very vi&s;ible above this Gate-way, the Remains of a Port Cullice. After the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> the Picture of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, was &s;et up on the South &s;ide of this Buil|ding, with this Motto under it, <HI>Adventus Regis, Solamen Gregis; The coming of the King, is the Comfort of the People.</HI> It was wont to look exceedingly beautiful, and in coming along the Bridge from the South, was a very wor|thy and con&s;picuous Ornament to the Town; but of late it is pretty much ob&s;cur'd with Du&s;t, if not defac'd with the Weather, through the Want of being put into a little Order and Regularity.</P>
<P>ON the North-&s;ide of this Building is an Account of it's being repair'd in the Year 1713. <HI>Henry Reay,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mayor; <HI>Jo&s;eph Green,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sheriff.</P>
<P>AFTER you come from under the Gateway of the <HI>Magazine,</HI> there is an <HI>open</HI> on the Bridge on either Side. Over the one of the&s;e it was that &s;urpri|zing Accident happened to Mr. <HI>Ander&s;on,</HI> a Merchant and Alderman this
<PB N="132" REF="143">
Town: As he was looking over the Bridge talking with a Friend, he finger'd a Ring he had on (as People frequently do when they are thoughtful) which before he was aware, fell into the River, and was given entirely over for lo&s;t. Sometime after one of his Servants having bought a Salmon in the Market, found the very Ring in the Belly of the Fi&s;h, and re&s;tored it to his Ma&s;ter. <HI>Herodotus</HI> gives the like Account in the 3d Book of <HI>Polycrates</HI> King of <HI>Samos,</HI> who was at that Time e&s;teem'd one of the Favourites of Fortune, which as my Authority ob&s;erves, may &s;atisfy us of the Truth of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s &s;aying, <HI>There is no new Thing under the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was Mayor of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and was Ance&s;tor of the pre&s;ent Mr. <HI>Abraham Ander&s;on</HI> Merchant, on the <HI>Sandhill.</HI> The &s;aid <HI>Fran|cis Ander&s;on</HI> made his E&s;tate to his Son <HI>Henry Ander&s;on,</HI> who was the Father of the &s;aid <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Grandfather. The E&s;tate and Ring have been in the Family ever &s;ince, and are now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid <HI>Abraham.</HI> I my &s;elf &s;aw this <HI>Ring</HI> about 4 Months ago. The Impre&s;&s;ion the Seal gives is that of <HI>Soloman</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Sheba.</HI> On the In&s;ide of the Ring, ju&s;t under the Signet, is the Picture of a <HI>Salmon,</HI> in Commemoration of the Fi&s;h and the Tran&s;action, on the one Side of which is the Letter <HI>F,</HI> and on the other the Letter <HI>R,</HI> in Commemoration of the <HI>Per&s;on.</HI> It is a Curio&s;ity &s;o great, that not only the whole Kingdom can't &s;how the like of it; but the whole World be&s;ide, nay the World it&s;elf never, that we know of, had the like Tran&s;action but once before, <HI>viz.</HI> that before-mentioned. The Gentleman therefore who has this valuable Jewel in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, ought to have the ut|mo&s;t Care of it upon many Accounts, and as none of the lea&s;t, that it is a Credit to his Family, as well as to the Town.</P>
<P>A little further, about the middle of the Bridge is a large old Tower, which they call the Tower of the Bridge, where leud and di&s;orderly Per&s;ons are kept 'till they are examined by the Mayor, and brought to due Puni&s;hment, ex|cept the Crime be of a very gro&s;s Nature, and then are removed to <HI>Newgate</HI> and there continue 'till the A&s;&s;izes. Beyond this a little is the <HI>Blue-Stone,</HI> which gives the Name of the <HI>Blue-Stone</HI> to that Part of the Bridge. Here is the Bounds of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Southwards. Beyond this, the other Part of the Bridge belongs to the County Palatine of <HI>Durham,</HI> and is repaired by the <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> At the End of the Bridge, which leads into <HI>Gate&s;ide,</HI> is another <HI>Tower,</HI> where has been a <HI>Draw-bridge.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Street is chiefly inhabited by &s;uch as have their Living by Shipping, &s;uch as Merchants, <HI>Ho&s;tmen, Brewars,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of</HI> Pandon <HI>or</HI> Pampedon.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING done with what was anciently called <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> we come now to de&s;cribe the ancient Town of <HI>Pampedon,</HI> which was a Town of it&s;elf di&s;tinct from <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> but was united to it in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>Vide anno</HI> 1299. There is &s;ome Doubt about the Rea&s;on of the Name, &s;ome imagining it came from <HI>Pandana,</HI> one of the Gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was &s;o called, <HI>quia &s;emper paterit,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>it &s;tood always open.</HI> But I dare &s;ay, this could ne|ver give Name to the Town of <HI>Pandon,</HI> which being in all Probability a <HI>Roman</HI> Place of Defence, was rather obliged to be always &s;hut. Others imagine it came from <HI>Pandara,</HI> a <HI>Scotti&s;h Virgin Saint;</HI> but for what Rea&s;on they know be&s;t. For my Part I never &s;aw one yet; and perhaps for good Rea&s;on. For if I mi&s;take not, this Town had the Name of <HI>Pandon,</HI> before there ever was <HI>a Saint in that Kingdom.</HI> I am therefore in|clinable to believe, that it got its Name from the <HI>Romans</HI> who lived in it, who, as <HI>Grey</HI> agrees, called it <HI>Pampedon</HI> or <HI>Pantheon,</HI> becau&s;e perhaps &s;ome Building was erected here in this Place, in Imitation of the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> (this Wall being the utmo&s;t Confines of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire) which was built in Honour of all the Gods. And as this Wall was the utmo&s;t Bounds of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> therefore there might be &s;uch a <HI>Temple</HI> in this Place, to remind the <HI>Romans</HI> of the nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the Gods, to pre&s;erve the Bounds of the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> The late <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Rom.

But with this I cannot agree; the <HI>Deen</HI> could not have that Weight with it, as to give Name to the whole Place; or &s;hould that be allowed, how is the former Part of the Name accounted for? It retains therefore (as <HI>Grey</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves) its Name, without much Alteration, &s;ince the <HI>Romans</HI> re&s;ided in it. After the Departure of the Ro|mans, as the &s;ame Authority gives out, the Kings of <HI>Northumberland</HI> kept their Re&s;idence in it, and had their Hou&s;e now called <HI>Pandon-Hall.</HI> It was a &s;afe Bulwark, having the <HI>Picls Wall</HI> on the North-&s;ide, and the River <HI>Time</HI> on the South. This Place of <HI>Pandon</HI> is of &s;uch Antiquity, that if a Man would expre&s;s an ancient Thing, it is a common <HI>Proverb, As old as</HI> Pandon-<HI>Gate.</HI> Thus far this Author.</P>

<P>BUT to treat of &s;ome Particulars of this ancient Town, we &s;hall begin then at the <HI>Manour-Chare,</HI> which leads from <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet</HI> to St. <HI>Au&s;tin Fryers.</HI> This Chare which leads from <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us Ho&s;pital,</HI> and from thence to the Head of the <HI>Broad-Chare,</HI> was in ancient Times called <HI>Cowgate.</HI> This is plain from an ancient Writing in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Tho|mas Waters,</HI> in <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet,</HI> dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 20, in the 5th Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, where are the&s;e Words, de&s;cribing the Situation of the Hou&s;e he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent: <HI>Prout jacet in vico Peregrinorum infra villam Novica&s;tri &s;uper Tynam inter Tenementum nuper Laurentii de Acton ex parte Boreali, &amp; Tenementum nuper Thomae Clerk, ex parte Au&s;trali, &amp; extendit in Longitudine a via Regia ante, u&s;que vicum quondam vocatum</HI> Cowgate, <HI>modo vocatum</HI> Au&s;tyn-Chare, <HI>retro.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th it had the Name of <HI>Au&s;tyn-Chare,</HI> as appears al|&s;o from this Writing: Now it has the Name of <HI>Manour-Chare</HI> which &s;ome imagine to be given from the Word Minor or Minorites, or Franci&s;cans; but unle&s;s they can prove that the <HI>Fryery</HI> of the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> was &s;ituated here, they never can prove that the Chare was &s;o called from them; and this is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to be done. For we have already &s;hewn that the <HI>Minorites</HI> or <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> had their Hou&s;e in another Part of the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>High-Fryar-Chare;</HI> this is al&s;o clearly proved from the &s;everal Writings of the Com|pany of Taylors, that this Place was formerly called <HI>Cowgate,</HI> and afterwards called the <HI>Frear-Chare,</HI> or St. <HI>Au&s;tin Frear-Chare.</HI> The&s;e Writings of theirs al&s;o mention an Alms-hou&s;e, which went by the Name of <HI>Ward</HI>'s Alms-hou&s;e, &s;ituated in this Chare, I &s;uppo&s;ed it was &s;ituated at the Bottom of Mr. <HI>Wa|ter</HI>'s Garden, for I have heard &s;ome old People &s;ay, they remember thereabouts the Ruins of an Alms-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Cowgate</HI> the ancient Name of the Street, is &s;till continued in one Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Foot of <HI>Silver-&s;treet,</HI> to the Head of the <HI>Broad-Chare.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING come down this Lane from <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet,</HI> we come to three different Ways; that on the Right leads down into <HI>Pandon;</HI> that on the Front leads into the <HI>Town</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;pital;</HI> and that on the Left, into St. <HI>Au&s;tin-Fryers,</HI> and <HI>Carliol-Croft.</HI></P>

<P>THE left-hand Pa&s;&s;age has &s;till the Remains of a large Gate, which has been one of the Gates leading to St. <HI>Au&s;tin-Fryers,</HI> which, (having pa&s;t this Gate) is a little above upon the Right Hand. There is &s;till a compleat Quadrangle, to be &s;een, the South-&s;ide of which has undoubtedly been the Chapel. This &s;eems to have been the ancient Building, for <HI>Grey</HI> &s;eems to
<PB N="136" REF="147">
&s;peak of &s;ome &s;umptuous Additions that were made to it. In &s;ucceeding A|ges, &s;ays he, it was inlarged and beautified with &s;tately Buildings, Cloy&s;ters, and a Fair Church. The Kings of <HI>England</HI> &s;ince the Conque&s;t, kept Hou&s;e in it, whence they came with an Army Royal again&s;t <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;ince the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Mona&s;teries, made a Magazine and Store-hou&s;e for the North Parts. Now of late that Princely Fabrick is demoli&s;hed, and laid level with the Ground. The Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Luxury and Idolatry of the&s;e Hou|&s;es brought a &s;udden Ruin upon them&s;elves and Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Authority tells us al&s;o, that there was an antient Religious Hou&s;e founded by the Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and that &s;everal of them were bu|ried here; but it cannot be true that they built any Thing for the St. <HI>Au|&s;tin</HI> Fryers, for they came not into <HI>England</HI> 'till long after the Conque&s;t, in the Year 1252. Then it was that <HI>Lanfrank</HI> of <HI>Milan,</HI> the fir&s;t General of the <HI>Eremites</HI> of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> &s;ent &s;ome of them into <HI>England</HI> to &s;eek a Dwelling for them&s;elves. The <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> Fryers held their fir&s;t Hou&s;e given them in <HI>Wales,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Wood-hou&s;e</HI> which before had belonged to the Family of the noble Family of the <HI>Turburvills.</HI> Afterward <HI>Humphry Bohun,</HI> Earl of <HI>Here|ford</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1253, gave them a Hou&s;e and beau|tiful Church, remarkable for a Spire of wonderful Workman&s;hip, in <HI>Lon|don;</HI> which is now partly a Meeting-hou&s;e for the German Prote&s;tants who have &s;ettled in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1377, the <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> Fryers obtained Leave to eat Fle&s;h, upon Condi|tion that they &s;hould keep the Fa&s;t of the Fryers Minors before Chri&s;tmas. <HI>Stephen. ad. Vol.</HI> 2d. 221.</P>
<P>WHAT Year this Hou&s;e was founded in, or this Order came to this Hou&s;e, I have no where met with, but the <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> are &s;aid to have been founded by the Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">De rebus Novoca&s;t'.</NOTE> the Baron of <HI>Werk,</HI> which I am inclinable to believe very true, for in the 11th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, 1317. I find mention made of &s;ome Lands in <HI>Cowgate,</HI> belonging to the Brethren of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> which were given them by <HI>William Ro&s;s</HI> who was Baron of <HI>Werk.</HI> How much earlier than this King's Reign this Mona&s;tery was founded, I have not been able to learn. But it's probable it was &s;ometime in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, and this I think is out of Di&s;pute now, for &s;ince this Conjecture of my own, I received a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wearing,</HI> of <HI>Bampton</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> with the following <HI>Account.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, in the 19th Year of his Reign, gave Leave to one <HI>John de Capella,</HI> to give and a&s;&s;ign a Me&s;&s;uage of his in <HI>Penrith,</HI> to the Prior and Fryers of the Order of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Hou&s;e is now turned partly into a Work-hou&s;e, for the Employment of the Poor; Part of it is turned into a Hou&s;e of Correction, a Dunghill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is the Charity-School of the Pari&s;h of <HI>All Hallows,</HI> which was built <HI>Anno</HI> 1723, and an Hou&s;e for the Ma&s;ter to live in, which was built the &s;ame Year.</P>
<P>THE Bells of <HI>All Hallows</HI> were ca&s;t in this Place, which &s;ince the Decay of the <HI>Mona&s;tery,</HI> was called rhe <HI>Artillery-yard,</HI> from the Town&s;mens perform|ing there the Exerci&s;e of the <HI>Pike</HI> and <HI>Gun.</HI></P>

<P>HAVING thus done with what relates to the Pa&s;&s;age above mentioned on the <HI>left Hand,</HI> let us enter that on the <HI>Front.</HI> And this is what the People call the <HI>Town's Ho&s;pital,</HI> but its true Name is <HI>Je&s;us Ho&s;pital,</HI> for it was dedicated to the <HI>Holy Je&s;us.</HI> You a&s;cend to it by Stairs from the high Street, and then enter into a <HI>plea&s;ing Field,</HI> on the North-&s;ide of which is the <HI>&s;aid Ho&s;pital.</HI> It is three Story high, and the Under-&s;tory is adorned with Piazza's, which are about 60 Yards in Length, and make a very agreeable Walk. About the Middle of the Piazza's is the Entrance into the &s;econd and third Stories; and over again&s;t this Entrance is a Fountain (very much beautified) for the U&s;e of the <HI>Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>new Ho&s;pital,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Town's Ho&s;pital</HI> in the Manours, dedicated to the <HI>Holy Je&s;us,</HI> was founded, erected, and endowed, at the Charge of this <HI>Corporation</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Anno 1681, T.

<P>ON the Ea&s;t of this &s;ame Field is the Hall of the <HI>Barber-Surgeons,</HI> which was rebuilt by them in the Year 1730.</P>
<P>IT is a very beautiful one, and not a little &s;umptuous; it &s;tands upon tall <HI>Piazza's,</HI> under which is a very &s;pacious Walk. There is before it a fine Square, divided into four Areas or Gra&s;s-Plats, &s;urrounded with Gravel-Walks, each of which is adorned with a Statue. The Fir&s;t of the two next the

<P>ON the other two Gra&s;s-Platts are the Figures of <HI>Medicus Pergameus</HI> or <HI>Galen,</HI> and <HI>Medicus Spagyricus</HI> or <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> which were erected 1712, <HI>Robert Golightly</HI> and <HI>William Handby</HI> Stewards. I am inform'd by one of this Com|pany, that in a little Time, the Wall at the Foot of the Garden will be taken away, and in&s;tead thereof will be Iron-Rails. It will &s;hew the Hall and Gardens to &s;ome Advantage, but be rather too great an Ornament for &s;uch a dirty Part of the Town.</P>
<P>THERE are be&s;ides this Square two other Gardens for Herbs, which to|gether with the <HI>Hall</HI> and <HI>Garden</HI> we have been &s;peaking of, are attended by a Gardner, who lives there for that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>WE now turn to the right Hand, and de&s;cend the Chair towards <HI>Pan|don,</HI> and pa&s;s by Mr. <HI>Waters</HI>'s Garden, at the End of which was <HI>Ward</HI>'s Alms-hou&s;e, above mentioned, of which I have lately met with the following Account from the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manu&s;cript. <Q>The chief <HI>Alms-hou&s;e</HI> in the Town is the <HI>Ward</HI>'s, near the <HI>Manour;</HI> the <HI>Mills</HI> at <HI>Pandon-gate</HI> &s;hould give them, as I remember, 20 <HI>s. per annum,</HI> to buy them <HI>Coals;</HI> but old Mr. <HI>Brandling</HI> pulled off the Lead, on purpo&s;e to expel the poor People, which he did. The <HI>Mills</HI> are now fallen into one <HI>Homers</HI>'s Hand, and &s;o is lo&s;t for ever. I have &s;een the Writings, and know it.</Q> Below this is a narrow Pa&s;&s;age which leads into the <HI>Carliol Croft.</HI> Below this again is a Place, which was formerly called the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> as &s;ays Tradition. It was &s;o called, becau&s;e in former Times, when the Tide flow'd up to the <HI>Stock-bridge,</HI> there was thereabout a <HI>Hill of Sand,</HI> which at the Tide's leav|ing of it, appeared like an I&s;land. They call it at pre&s;ent <HI>Alvey</HI>'s I&s;land, be|cau&s;e it belong'd to one of that Name. It is the very Place, on which &s;tands the <HI>Hou&s;e, Cellars,</HI> and <HI>Malting</HI> of Mr. <HI>George Hink&s;ter,</HI> which are bounded on the We&s;t, North and South by the King's Street, and on the Ea&s;t by a wa&s;te Piece of Ground, of the Lady <HI>Goldsburgh,</HI> which was formerly called <HI>the Stones.</HI></P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the South Front of this Hou&s;e was the ancient Building, <HI>viz. Pandon-hall,</HI> above mentioned, but now rebuilt in &s;ome Mea&s;ure. There are &s;till remaining many ancient Walls and Parts of this Building; it was of con|&s;iderable Bigne&s;s, having been according to Tradition, on its North-front in Length from the <HI>Stockbridge</HI> to <HI>Cowgate;</HI> and on its We&s;t-front in Length from its <HI>North-we&s;t Corner,</HI> beyond that Lane that leads into <HI>Blyth's Nook.</HI></P>
<P>IT is of great Antiquity, being built in the Times of the <HI>Heptarchy;</HI> for it was the Hou&s;e of the Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who liv'd in it, for which Rea&s;on it was call'd <HI>Pandon-hall.</HI></P>

<P>FROM hence we go Ea&s;tward unto <HI>Pandon-Bridge,</HI> which is called the <HI>Stock-Bridge.</HI> It was undoubtedly of Wood in ancient Times, tho' we meet with an Account of its being Stone, when <HI>Thomas de Carliol</HI> was Mayor, which was in <HI>Edward</HI> I. Time at late&s;t. To this Place it was that the <HI>Fi&s;hermen</HI> brought up their Fi&s;h, and &s;old them here, as <HI>Grey</HI> ob&s;erves from Tradition. But to confirm this beyond the Force of Tradition; it mu&s;t cer|tainly have been true, that the <HI>Fi&s;h-market</HI> was here, becau&s;e the Street you go into when you have pa&s;t <HI>Pandon-Bridge,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Fi&s;her-gate.</HI> Now this is plain from an ancient Writing, which was drawn when <HI>Henry le Scot</HI> was Mayor of this Town, about the Year 1287. I &s;hall give my Au|thority at large, becau&s;e there depends upon it &s;ome other Things be&s;ides this.</P>
<P>THE Writing is a Conveyance of &s;ome Land which is thus de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><HI>QUAE extendit in longitudine &agrave; communi via &s;uper le Wall-Knoll, in au&s;tralem. Partem dom&ucirc;s Fratrum de monte Carmel, u&s;que ad communem viam quae &s;olebat du|cere ver&s;us</HI> Fi&s;hergate, <HI>i. e.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH Land extends it&s;elf from the Street of the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> to the South-&s;ide of the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> even to the High-way, which formerly led to <HI>Fi&s;hergate.</HI></P>
<P>NOW it is certain, this Mona&s;tery was at the Top of the <HI>Wall-Knoll;</HI> the Remains of it are &s;till in Being, and &s;hall be by and by further con&s;ider'd. It is al&s;o certain from this ancient Writing, that a Way led from the <HI>South-&s;ide</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Mona&s;tery</HI> to <HI>Fi&s;hergate;</HI> therefore this Street mu&s;t be <HI>Fi&s;hergate,</HI> becau&s;e the common Way here &s;poken of could lead to no other Place. I take this common Way to have been tho&s;e <HI>Stairs</HI> be&s;ide Mr. <HI>Green</HI>'s Hou&s;e at the <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> which lead up to the <HI>Gardens</HI> there, and which, were it not a <HI>Wall,</HI> would lead directly from this Street to the Remains of this <HI>Mo|na&s;tery.</HI></P>
<P>AS we go along from the <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> we meet two Streets, one on the left Hand, and the other on the right. That on the left Hand is called the <HI>Wall-Knoll,</HI> which, as it is a very great A&s;cent and high Hill from <HI>Fi&s;hergate,</HI> &s;o it &s;eems to me to have this Name from the <HI>Roman Wall</HI> going along it; for the Word <HI>Knoll</HI> &s;ignifies an <HI>Hill</HI> or <HI>Eminence,</HI> as I gather from the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Note in <HI>Cambden</HI> upon <HI>Sevenoke</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> who &s;ays, On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it &s;tandeth <HI>Knowll,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it is &s;eated upon a <HI>Hill.</HI> And <HI>Grey</HI> &s;ays al&s;o po&s;itively, that it was Part of the <HI>Picts</HI> Wall.</P>

<P>IT is &s;aid by <HI>Dugdale</HI> in his Baron. <HI>Lumley,</HI> that the <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> he is there &s;peaking of, was the Founder of the Hou&s;e of the <HI>White Fryars</HI> in <HI>New|ca&s;tle.</HI> But this <HI>Roger</HI> can &s;carce be the Founder of it, for I have proved him to be the younger <HI>Roger;</HI> and it was taken Notice of above, that <HI>Roger</HI> the Elder left Two Fother of Lead to it when he died, &s;o that if either of them be the Founder, it mu&s;t be the Elder, rather than the Younger that <HI>Dugdale</HI> &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>BUT I believe it will be a difficult Matter, upon Examination, to prove either the Father or the Son the Founder of it, for it boa&s;ts a greater Anti|quity: For this <HI>Domus Fratrum de Monte Carmel,</HI> is mentioned in an ancient Writing which was drawn when <HI>Henry le Scot</HI> was Mayor, about the Year 1287, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t, as is &s;aid above, and therefore it mu&s;t at that Time have been in being; but the Elder of them was not Mayor of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> 'till 114 Years after this; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be the Founder, and therefore much le&s;s his Son. They might, and probably they
<PB N="142" REF="153">
both of them were <HI>great Benefactors,</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Founders</HI> to it, and &s;o have been e&s;teemed each of them <HI>Founders</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THEY &s;urrender'd at the &s;ame Time with the Re&s;t: Sometime after they &s;urrender'd, King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th made a pre&s;ent of this <HI>Priory</HI> and its Re|venues, together with &s;ome other Lands belonging to other religious Hou&s;es, lying in <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Gre&s;ham,</HI> Alderman of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Richard Billing ford,</HI> Gent. who 21&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> 2d <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th, conveyed them to <HI>William Dent,</HI> of this Town, Gentleman.

<HEAD>Sect. VIII. <HI>Of</HI> CROSSWELL-GATE, BYKER-CHARE.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE when we went from <HI>Fi&s;hergate-&s;treet,</HI> we met two Streets, that on the Left Hand we have already treated of: The other, I imagine, is that which formerly went by the Name of <HI>Cro&s;swell-gate,</HI> which is often mentioned in ancient Writings. It is reported that the Dwelling-hou&s;e of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> was in this Street. Whatever Truth is in this, it is certain, that many Hou&s;es in this Street pay an Annual Rent to the Lord <HI>Scarborough</HI> to this Day, into who&s;e Family the Grand-daughter of <HI>Roger Thornton</HI> was mar|ryed. There are in this Street &s;everal <HI>Lanes</HI> or <HI>Allies,</HI> the fir&s;t we meet with in going along from <HI>Fi&s;hergate,</HI> is a Place called, at pre&s;ent, <HI>Blyth</HI>'s <HI>Nook:</HI> It is built over <HI>Pandon Burne.</HI> The next is a narrow Lane leading to the <HI>Burne Bank,</HI> a Place by which <HI>Pandon Burne</HI> runs into the <HI>Tyne.</HI> It lies very low, and before the Heightning of the Ground with Balla&s;t, and the Building of the <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Key,</HI> was often of great Hazard to the Inhabitants; once in particular a mo&s;t melancholy accident happen'd in this Place, in the Year 1320, the 13th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Tyne</HI> over-flowed &s;o much, that 120 <HI>Laymen,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> be&s;ides Women, were drowned; and as <HI>Grey</HI> &s;ays, 140 Hou&s;es were de&s;troyed. <HI>Compleat Hi&s;t. Eng. Vol. 1&s;t. P. 235.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND this again is a Chare called <HI>Byker Chare,</HI> which &s;eems by the a|ged Look of &s;everal of the Buildings, tho&s;e e&s;pecially at the <HI>North-end</HI> of the Chare, where is the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Henry Atkin&s;on,</HI> Hoa&s;tman, to be of great Antiquity: Perhaps it got the Name of <HI>Byker-Chare,</HI> from one <HI>Robert

de Byker</HI> and <HI>Laderine,</HI> his Wife, who had Lands in <HI>Pandon, &amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Anno</HI> 1299.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. IX. COWGATE, TRINITY-HOUSE, BROAD-CHARE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Pandon-Hall,</HI> we went Ea&s;tward into <HI>Pandon;</HI> it remains now, that we go Southward from the &s;ame Place. Leaving then <HI>Silver-&s;treet</HI> on the Right Hand, we come into <HI>Cowgate,</HI> which has been a Part of the Town where &s;ome eminent Men have lived in; &s;uch as <HI>Gilbert de Cowgate, Walter de Cowgate,</HI> &amp;c. who were Men of Fortune and E&s;tate. Going forward, we pa&s;s by <HI>Blythe Nook</HI> on the Left Hand, and the <HI>Dog-Bank</HI> on the Right, and then we come to the <HI>Broad Chare;</HI> a little below the En|trance of which, is the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e;</HI> which according to &s;ome was a <HI>Mo|na&s;try,</HI> dedicated to the <HI>Holy Trinity.</HI> This Order of the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e</HI> was founded by St. <HI>John de Matha</HI> and St. <HI>John de Valois,</HI> in the Year 1198, in the Popedom of <HI>Innocent</HI> III. The End of its In&s;titution was the Redemp|tion of Captives. In the Year 1224, a Mona&s;try was founded for this Order in <HI>Kent.</HI> What Time this Mona&s;try of the <HI>Trinity</HI> (if there was &s;uch a one) was founded in this Town, we are intirely in the Dark: Only it was &s;aid by &s;ome, that <HI>Laurentius</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> was its Founder. If this be true, it is not improbable but it was <HI>Laurentius Acton,</HI> who was Mayor of this Town in 1435 and 1436, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WE are al&s;o equally at a lo&s;s as to its Situation: For Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his Collection of Records, <HI>P.</HI> 146, &s;ays, It was on the <HI>Wall-knoll,</HI> in <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> and that they &s;urrender'd <HI>January</HI> 10th, 30th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th. If it was here, I know of no Place to fix it in, but where the <HI>Carmelites</HI> were, and this could never be. I am therefore inclinable to believe, that this Mona&s;try means that of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and through a Mi&s;take is called that of the <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>BUT be that as it will, it is certain that this Place called the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e,</HI> was no <HI>Religious Hou&s;e:</HI> For it is &s;aid in our Account below, to have been called of old Time <HI>Dalton</HI>'s <HI>Place.</HI> And be&s;ides, had it been this <HI>Religious Hou&s;e,</HI> the Mariners could not have got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it 'till its Suppre&s;&s;ion, which was on the 10th of <HI>January,</HI> 30th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th; whereas it was conveyed to them the 20th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, as the following Account te&s;ti|fies.</P>
<P>A Writing in the Cu&s;tody of the Brethren of the <HI>Trinity-Hou&s;e,</HI> dated the 4th Day of <HI>January,</HI> the 20th of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, which gives an Account of a Me&s;&s;uage and Garden, which was convey'd by one <HI>Ralph Heb|borne,</HI> of <HI>Hebborne,</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the Fraternity of the Mariners. It is the Place where is now the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e,</HI> which was in old Time called <HI>Dalton</HI>'s <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;ame Writing it is order'd, that the afore&s;aid Me&s;&s;uage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall be repair'd for Ever by the common Pur&s;e of the Brotherhood; that in &s;ome convenient Part of it &s;hould be an <HI>Hall</HI> for the <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> to meet in, at all
<PB N="144" REF="155">
Times convenient, for the ob&s;erving of their Rules, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that in the Re|&s;idue of the &s;ame, there &s;hould be certain Lodgings order'd for &s;uch of the &s;aid <HI>Fellow&s;hip,</HI> as afterwards &s;hould fall into Poverty, or be not able to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves: Tho&s;e they held during the Term of their Lives, and then were &s;ucceeded by others in the like nece&s;&s;itous Circum&s;tances. It was al&s;o order|ed in this Writing, that within the &s;aid Me&s;&s;uage, there &s;hould be a Chappel and a Prie&s;t, to &s;ing and &s;ay Ma&s;s, and other Divine Service therein, as &s;hould be appointed by the Aldermen, and Wardens of the &s;aid <HI>Fraternity,</HI> for the Time being. That the Prie&s;t and the &s;aid poor Per&s;ons &s;o admitted, &s;hould pray for the good E&s;tate of the &s;aid <HI>Ralph Hebborne,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>John Hebborne, George Hebborne,</HI> and for the Ma&s;ters Souls, and for the good E&s;tate of the &s;aid <HI>Fellow&s;hip,</HI> and for the Souls of &s;uch of the &s;ame <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> as be depar|ted, or hereafter &s;hould depart to the Mercy of God; and al&s;o for the Souls of <HI>John Dalton,</HI> &s;ometime Owner of the &s;aid Me&s;&s;uage, his Ance&s;tors Souls, and all Chri&s;tian Souls.</P>
<P>ONE Part of this Writing was to be put in a Che&s;t, belonging to the <HI>Fellow&s;hip,</HI> and kept by them; the other was to be kept in a Che&s;t for that purpo&s;e, in the Ve&s;try of <HI>All-Hallows</HI> in this Town, in the Cu&s;tody of the Church-Wardens, for the Time being, for Ever.</P>
<P>THIS was further confirm'd to the <HI>Fraternity</HI> of the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e,</HI> by <HI>Tho|mas Hebborne,</HI> Son of the &s;aid <HI>Ralph Hebborne,</HI> on the 9th of <HI>September,</HI> in the 16th of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, upon the Conditions following, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> &s;hould pay to the &s;aid <HI>Thomas Hebborne,</HI> his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns, within the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> on the Vigil of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Month of <HI>June, a Pottle of Wine,</HI> if it be demanded yearly, for Evermore. That the &s;aid <HI>Thomas Hebborne</HI> &s;hould be made a Brother of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> and Partaker of all Ma&s;&s;es, good Prayers and Suffrage, which &s;hould afterwards be celebrated, &s;aid and done by the Chaplain and Prie&s;t of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> within the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e,</HI> and at the <HI>Trinity</HI> Altar within the Church of <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> for Evermore; with &s;uch Ob&s;equies and Funeral Ce|remonies, as u&s;ually were done at the Burial of any Brother of the &s;ame <HI>Fra|ternity,</HI> if the &s;aid <HI>Thomas</HI> departs within this Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> The Prie&s;t of the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e</HI> at this Time, was one Sir <HI>Robert Elli&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>TO this Writing was annex'd the Seal of the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the Names of the Mayor, Sheriff, and Aldermen.</P>
<P><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">On <HI>Oct.</HI> the 5th, <HI>28 Hen. 8.</HI> Light-hou&s;es were permitted to be built by the <HI>Trinity-hou&s;e,</HI> to found, edify, make and build <HI>two Towers;</HI> that is to &s;ay, one on the North Part of <HI>Shields,</HI> in the Entrance of the Har|bour, and a|nother upon the Hill.</NOTE>KING <HI>James</HI> the 1&s;t, in the third Year of his Reign, granted to the <HI>Ma|&s;ter, Pylots,</HI> and <HI>Seamen</HI> of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> a Charter.</P>
<P>SEVENTEENTH of <HI>October</HI> 1664, King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, granted them an|other Charter.</P>
<P>AND a Third was granted them 26th of <HI>July</HI> 1687, by King <HI>James</HI> the 2d.</P>
<P>IN a Manu&s;cript I have frequently mentioned, it is &s;aid that the <HI>Trinity Hou&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Broad Chare,</HI> was held by the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Mariners</HI> of this Town of the <HI>Ander&s;ons,</HI> by giving them a red Ro&s;e at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> which <HI>Bartram Ander&s;on</HI> turned to Wine, and then &s;old it to Sir <HI>Ralph Jeni&s;on,</HI> and it adds, how they agree I know not. It is at pre&s;ent a very pretty Building, con&s;i&s;t|ing of a hand&s;ome Square, very Mona&s;tick in it's A&s;pect, having it's Appart|ments or Lodgings for the Inhabitants, a very neat <HI>Chappel,</HI> and a magnificent <HI>Hall.</HI> It maintains 14 Per&s;ons, allowing every one a <HI>Chamber,</HI> eight Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month, <HI>Coals</HI> and <HI>Cloathing.</HI> There are al&s;o 15 <HI>extra</HI> Per&s;ons, which have allowed them, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s.</P>
<P>LEAVING this Hou&s;e of the <HI>Marriners,</HI> we go down the <HI>Broad Chare,</HI> without any Thing remarkable, 'till you come to the <HI>Key-&s;ide;</HI> about the Middle of it is a <HI>Square,</HI> which goes by the Name of <HI>Stony-hill,</HI> nigh it a Lane, called <HI>Spicer-lane,</HI> which al&s;o leads on to the <HI>Key.</HI></P>

<P>_WITHOUT the <HI>Clo&s;e-Gate</HI> is a pretty long Street, with Hou&s;es on each Side; which goes as far as a <HI>Dike</HI> called <HI>Skinner-Bourne,</HI> where are of late Years a Factory belonging to Mr. <HI>Thomlin&s;on,</HI> a Pot-Hou&s;e to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Blenkin&s;op</HI> and <HI>Ralph Harl,</HI> and a Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e to Mr. <HI>Dagney,</HI> and Company; from thence Northward at the Top of the Hill is the Place called the <HI>Forth,</HI> anciently called the <HI>Frith,</HI> which lies without the Walls of the Town, and abutts on the South on a certain little Clo&s;e called <HI>Goo&s;e-green-Clo&s;e,</HI> then it extends it|&s;elf to a Clo&s;e called <HI>Dove-cote-Clo&s;e,</HI> and from thence We&s;tward by the fur|the&s;t Ditch of the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> which lies contiguous to the Corner of the Hedge, which is next to the Common Way which leads into the <HI>Forth.</HI> Then by and over the Common Way to the little Rivulet or Syke of Water in the Bottom of the Valley, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing the Syke, you go upwards to the Clo&s;e called <HI>Goo&s;e-green-Clo&s;e.</HI> The Forth contains 11 Acres of Ground. It was &s;urveyed by Order of the Parliament, in the Year 1649, and valued at 12 l. per Annum.</P>
<P>IT was valued Tythe-free. The Town pay'd 4 l. per Annum to the King for it.</P>
<P>HOW it comes to be called <HI>Forth</HI> or <HI>Frith,</HI> I can only conjecture. The Word <NOTE N="&s;" PLACE="marg">Blount Law Dictio|nary in verb. <HI>Frith.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Forth</HI> or <HI>Frith,</HI> as it is anciently called, comes from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Frith,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Peace.</HI> For the Engli&s;h <HI>Saxons</HI> held &s;everal Woods to be &s;acred, and made them <HI>Sanctuaries.</HI> From this Definition of the Word, it may be no improbable Conjecture that the ancient <HI>Saxons</HI> inhabiting about the Parts of the Wall where the Town now is, gave the Name of <HI>Frith</HI> to
<PB N="146" REF="157">
this Place, as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier Shades and darker Re|ce&s;&s;es, the awful Excitors of Heathen Super&s;tition, than other Places about the Town were.</P>
<P>IN the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. a Licence was granted to the Town&s;men of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> bearing Date <HI>Dec.</HI> 23d of his Reign to dig Coals and Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this Place called the <HI>Forth.</HI> And here it was as &s;ome think, or rather as others, in the <HI>Ca&s;tle Lea&s;es</HI> that the fir&s;t <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Coals were wrought.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to have been all along a Place of Plea&s;ure and Recreation. For it was an ancient Cu&s;tom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of this Town, accompanied with great Numbers of the Burge&s;&s;es, to go every Year at the Fea&s;ts of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Whit&s;untide</HI> to the <HI>Forth,</HI> with the Maces, Sword and Cap of Maintenance carried before them. Undoubtedly the va&s;t Concour&s;e of both young and old at this Place at the&s;e Sea&s;ons of the Year, rather than at any other about this Town, is the remains of this ancient Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>AFTER the building of the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> it is &s;aid (but without any ju&s;t Autho|rity) that the <HI>Forth</HI> was anciently a <HI>Fort</HI> belonging to the <HI>Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year  <GAP DESC="blank"> , Part of it was turned into a pretty large Bowling-Green; which was adorn'd with a broad Gravel Walk and a double Row of Trees around it. It is at pre&s;ent a mighty pretty Place, exceeding by much any Common Place of Plea&s;ure about the Town. On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it, you have a Pro&s;pect of Part of the Town's Wall, through which is the Common Pa&s;&s;age to and from this Place under a &s;hady Walk of Trees; on the We&s;t you View the Grounds of the Village of <HI>El&s;wick,</HI> which have a gentle a&s;cent to the Village it&s;elf; a Place at the proper Sea&s;on of the Year much frequen|ted by the Town's People, for its plea&s;ing Walk and rural Entertainment.</P>
<P>FROM this Quarter we view al&s;o as we do from the South, the Banks of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> together with their Villages. On the North is an Hou&s;e of Accommodation.</P>
<P><HI>GREY</HI> &s;ays that it was given to the Town&s;men for their Services, by <HI>Edward</HI> III. Whereas it &s;eems to have been theirs in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III.

<P>FROM hence we proceed to the We&s;t-gate, which gives Name to a little Village within the Bounds of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> from whence &s;till going on by the Out-&s;ide of the Town's Wall, we come to the <HI>Warden's-clo&s;e.</HI> It &s;eems to be called the <HI>Warden's-clo&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e it belong'd to the Wardens of the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth.</HI> For <HI>Grey</HI> tells us he had his Hou&s;e, Garden, and Fi&s;h-Pond, &amp;c. here.

<P>THIS Place was formerly the Inheritance of divers Per&s;ons, Owners there|of, who were accu&s;tomed from ancient Time, to take the fore Crop thereof yearly, at or before <HI>Lammas-Day,</HI> and after that, by an ancient Cu&s;tom, all the Burge&s;&s;es of this Town u&s;ed to put in their Kine, and u&s;ed the &s;ame in pa|&s;turing of them 'till <HI>Lady-day</HI> in <HI>Lent</HI> yearly, and then to lay the &s;ame for Meadow again 'till <HI>Lammas.</HI></P>

<PB N="149" REF="160">
had an Immemorial Right to the Town-Moor, in the Days of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and this is proved from his Charter above-mentioned; then it is very impro|bable that <HI>Adamarus de Athol,</HI> of <HI>Ge&s;munde,</HI> &s;hould be the Donor of it. For this <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">De reb. Novica&s;t. p. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Adam</HI> was High Sheriff of the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in the Fifth of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and was living in the Year of our Lord 1392, as appears by an Indulgence of 40 Days granted to the Church of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, which was in the Proceedings upon a Di&s;pute, about 30 Years after, relating to the <HI>Town-Moor.</HI> It is declared, that the <HI>Town-Moor</HI> had belonged to the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> immemorially, or Time out of Mind: But how can it be &s;aid to be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town for &s;o long a Time, when he him&s;elf, who gave it, lived thirty Years after this Declaration? And if he did &s;o; no doubt but &s;everal others liv'd &s;o long too. Either then the Town was not at the Time of this Di&s;pute immemorially in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Ground, or this <HI>Adamarus de Athol,</HI> was not the Donor of it. Again, had he been the Donor of it, he mu&s;t have been 120 Years old at his Death; that is to &s;ay, he liv'd thirty Years after this Di&s;pute, and Ninety before to make it immemorial; (which is the lea&s;t Time that can be allow'd to make any Thing &s;o) &s;o that the&s;e two put together will make that Number of Years at his Death. It is not indeed in this Age of the World impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to live &s;o long, but yet it is highly improbable. There are few come to this Age, and when they do, they are look'd upon as &s;o many great Exceptions to the general Rule of the Ages of Men; and then their Ages &s;tand upon Record to &s;uccceed|ing Generations; and no doubt, had this been true of <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> it wou'd at lea&s;t have been mention'd upon his <HI>Tomb-Stone,</HI> but we find no &s;uch Thing. Nay, &s;hould we allow, for the Sake of making him the Donor, that he really lived 120 Years; yet after all, this grand Ab&s;urdity would fol|low, that if the <HI>Town,</HI> when this Di&s;pute happen'd, had had it immemorially; he mu&s;t have made a Pre&s;ent of it on the very Day he was born.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e Rea&s;ons therefore it's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be the Donor of it, but &s;ome of his <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> of the &s;ame Name might: And this is the rather to be imagin'd, becau&s;e Tradition &s;ays, it was <HI>Adam de Athol,</HI> of <HI>Je&s;umund,</HI> hand|ing down the Name to this Day. As then he was of the &s;ame Name, and undoubtedly a great Benefactor to this Town, &s;o the good Deeds of &s;ome of his Ance&s;tors might have been a&s;cribed to him through Mi&s;take, and &s;o be handed down to this pre&s;ent Day. There was one <HI>Adam de Je&s;umuthia,</HI> or <HI>Ge&s;mund,</HI> who order'd that one <HI>Good-Plank,</HI> or <HI>Six-Shillings,</HI> &s;hould be given annually (as may be &s;een in the Account of the <HI>Tyne-Bridge</HI>) for the Repara|tion of the <HI>Bridge.</HI> Perhaps it was him, for the Bridge was burnt in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. in the Year 1248, and immediately they &s;et about the Repair of it, and this <HI>Adam</HI> was one of the Benefactors to it. If then Tra|dition &s;ays true, that <HI>Adam de Je&s;mund</HI> was the Donor of the <HI>Town-Moor</HI> to the Town, this is probably the very Man, and whether he gave it before the Burning of the <HI>Bridge,</HI> or at the Time of his Benefaction to the <HI>Bridge;</HI> yet in the Thirty fir&s;t of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it would undoubtedly have been the Town's immemorially, which is a good pre&s;umptive Proof of this Conjun|cture, that this was the very Man. Be this as it will, it is certain that it had been the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Time out of Mind in the Thirty fir&s;t Year of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and was then confirm'd to them, as has been ob&s;erved above; in our Account of the <HI>Ca&s;tle Lea&s;es.</HI></P>

His Body was buried nigh the High-Altar, on the North &s;ide of the Chancel, in St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Chapel.</P>
<P>HE was a great Benefactor to this Ho&s;pital, as appears from his Charity and Genero&s;ity in the fir&s;t Year of his Ma&s;ter&s;hip. For whereas <HI>Laurentius Acton</HI> had the &s;aid Ho&s;pital in perpetuum, for him&s;elf, his Heirs and A&s;&s;igns, this worthy Man paid for his own Right 40 Marks to the &s;aid <HI>Laurentius,</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Laurentius</HI> had the fir&s;t Fruits belonging to the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, which yearly amounted to the Sum of 200 Marks.</P>
<P>ONE <HI>Richard Sperman</HI> had an annual Pen&s;ion from the &s;aid Ho&s;pital of 8 Marks, which Pen&s;ion the abovementioned Gentleman in the 2d Year of his Ma&s;ter&s;hip bought out for the &s;aid Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>HE al&s;o the &s;ame Year freed the &s;aid Ho&s;pital from an annual Pen&s;ion, which was payable to <HI>Hugo de Mitford.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Ma&s;ter of this Ho&s;pital, in this &s;ame Year following, built in the &s;aid Ho&s;pital a Con&s;i&s;tory, a Stable, and a Bier, and made in the Quire two New Windows facing the South of the &s;aid Chapel, be&s;ides a Number of other good and generous Charities which he be&s;towed upon this Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163">THE &s;ame Gentleman proves judicially in the King's Court, that the Mayor and Commonalty of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> did a&s;&s;ign, pre&s;ent, and in|duct the Ma&s;ter of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital. He was Ma&s;ter of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital about five Years.</P>

<P>IN the Year 1569, 15th <HI>February,</HI> the Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> granted the next Pre&s;entation of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Maid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enes,</HI> to <HI>Henry Ander&s;on, Robert Mitford,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;topher Mitford.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Account of <HI>Ficket-Tower,</HI> there is Mention made of a <HI>Great Cro&s;s,</HI> &s;tanding within <HI>Maudlin-Barras;</HI> and in the <HI>Milbank</HI> Manu&s;cript it is &s;aid, <HI>At the End of the</HI> Barras<HI>-Bridge before the Chapel &s;tood a &s;tately Cro&s;s firm and compleat,</HI> and <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">This <HI>Pigg</HI> was a Rebel, a very great <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> a Monument of his whim&s;i|cal Head is that <HI>Stone-Pillar,</HI> a lit|tle North of the three <HI>Mile Bridge,</HI> which every de&s;ervedly to this Day, bears the Title of <HI>Pig</HI>'s Folly.</NOTE> <HI>John Pigg</HI> in the Time of the Rebellion took it down, and called it Idolatry, and thought to make his own U&s;e of it; but it was broke by &s;ome who hated it &s;hould be prophaned.

<P>LEAVING St. <HI>Mary Magdalens,</HI> we go forward to the End of this Street, which together with the End of the Street leading from <HI>Newgate,</HI> meets at the <HI>Barras-Bridge.</HI></P>
<P>HOW it comes by the Name of <HI>Barras-Bridge, Grey</HI> gives us no Account. Others have imagined it to be &s;o called, from a Per&s;on of that Name, who was its Builder or Benefactor. This Conjecture in my Opinion is a grand Mi&s;take; for we have ju&s;t now mentioned the <HI>Maudlin-Barras,</HI> and therefore the Word <HI>Barras</HI> mu&s;t imply &s;omething el&s;e. The Manu&s;cript above men|tioned &s;peaking of the Antiquity of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Church, gives this as a Rea&s;on of its being the olde&s;t in Town, becau&s;e it is next the <HI>Barras,</HI> which hath been the ancient <HI>Barracado</HI> of the Town. So then according to this Ac|count, it got its Name from the Word <HI>Barracado.</HI> This al&s;o in my Opinion is a Mi&s;take. For the Word <HI>Barrows</HI> (for &s;o it &s;hould be &s;pell'd) &s;ignifies the &s;ame as <HI>Tinnuli,</HI> Hillocks, and &s;ometimes <HI>Graves</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres:</HI> And when it is con&s;idered, that the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> was founded for the Reception of <HI>Leprous Folks,</HI> it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the <HI>Maudlin-Borrows</HI> are the <HI>Tombs</HI> or <HI>Burial-Places</HI> of tho&s;e that died of the <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> in that <HI>Ho&s;pi|tal;</HI> and &s;ince the Burial-place it &s;elf was nigh to the Bridge, the Bridge got thence the Name of the <HI>Barrows-Bridge.</HI> The <HI>Barras</HI> mentioned in the Ac|count of <HI>Ficket-Tower</HI> are the &s;ame Thing; nothing el&s;e but the Burial-place of the <HI>Franci&s;can Friars.</HI></P>
<P>THE Place of the <HI>Maudlin Barrows</HI> I take to be the &s;ick Man's Clo&s;e; for as after the abating of the Lepro&s;y, this Ho&s;pital was obliged to take the Poor of the Town in during the Time of the Pe&s;tilence; &s;o I que&s;tion not, but tho&s;e that died were buried in the ancient Burial-place or Barrows of the Ho&s;pital. And &s;ince we are certain they were buried in the <HI>&s;ick Man</HI>'s <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> we may
<PB N="153" REF="164">
be therefore almo&s;t certain, that the <HI>&s;ick Man</HI>'s <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> was the <HI>Barrows</HI> of this <HI>Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Barrows-Mill</HI> belong'd to the <HI>black Friars;</HI> and in the Year 1558, paid a Rent to the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> of 2 <HI>s. per annum. Lib. Cart. p.</HI> 43.</P>
<P>THE Chapel on the other Side the <HI>Barrows-Bridge</HI> was dedicated to St. <HI>James</HI> the Apo&s;tle, and was anciently called St. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> An|drew <HI>Tower.</HI></NOTE> <HI>James</HI>'s Kirk. I &s;uppo&s;e it was a <HI>Chapel</HI> of Ea&s;e to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> for <HI>Je&s;mond</HI> and <HI>Sandiford,</HI> and other Out-parts of that Pari&s;h.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Sect. VI.</HI> Of the Suburbs of <HI>PANDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Suburbs out of <HI>Pandon-Gate</HI> are but very few Hou&s;es; but there are <HI>Gardens</HI> all the Way up the Cau&s;eway; two of them are tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Simp&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Charles Atkin&s;on.</HI> This Way was within the&s;e four Years the plea&s;ante&s;t Entrance into the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> having Gardens on each Side, be&s;et with <HI>Trees</HI> of &s;o large a Size and Shade, that they covered the Street it&s;elf in &s;everal Places. The&s;e were cut down for a little unpo&s;&s;e&s;t Money, and the greate&s;t Beauty of the Street lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE are in this Street two or three Pa&s;&s;ages, leading to different Places, which it may not be ami&s;s to mention. After you are out of <HI>Pandon-gate,</HI> there is one on the left Hand leading to <HI>Pandon-Dean,</HI> a very <HI>Romantick Place,</HI> full of Hills and Vales, through which runs <HI>Pandon-Burn.</HI> It is a very entertaining Walk in the Summer to <HI>Magdalen</HI>-Well. A little above this is another very narrow Pa&s;&s;age on the right Hand, bordering upon Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI>'s Garden, which leads to a Place called the <HI>Garth-Heads,</HI> which was a Place of Plea&s;ure and Recreation; but of late it was taken in, and made a <HI>common Gar|den</HI> of, by <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Proprietor of it.</P>
<P>HAVING pa&s;t this Lane, we proceed till we come to the Top of this great A&s;cent (for &s;uch indeed is this Street) and there we meet with two Ways; the one leads to the <HI>Shield-Field,</HI> the Property of Mr. <HI>Charles Clark</HI> of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> which has been already mentioned; and the other to <HI>Ow&s;e-Burn,</HI> which is at pre&s;ent a large Village, occa&s;ioned by the Coal-works of <HI>Richard Ridley</HI> and <HI>Matthew White,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;qs</ABBR> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT takes its Name from the Burn that runs through it. The Banks of this Burn are in many Places terribly high, in all Places beautifully Roman|tick.</P>
<P>BEFORE we come to the Suburbs of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> we mu&s;t not omit to men|tion the <HI>Keelmens Ho&s;pital;</HI> it is &s;ituated &s;ome Di&s;tance Ea&s;t of the <HI>Town's Wall,</HI> between the <HI>Carpenters Tower</HI> and <HI>Sandgate.</HI> It is a &s;quare Building, done in the Form of <HI>Mona&s;teries</HI> and <HI>Colleges,</HI> having its low Walk round it, in Imitation of <HI>Cloy&s;ters.</HI> The Area in the Middle of it, is about 83 Foot broad, and about 97&frac12; Foot long. There are upwards of fifty Chambers in it. Who it was built by, may be learned from the In&s;cription above the En|trance of it, which is as follows: <HI>The Keelmens Ho&s;pital, built at their own Charge,</HI> Anno Domini 1701, Matthew White, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governour, Mr.</HI> Edward Grey, <HI>Mr.</HI> Edward Carr, <HI>Stewards of the Hoa&s;tmens Company for the Time be|ing,
<PB N="154" REF="165">
and Tru&s;tees for this Ho&s;pital.</HI> I have been told, that Dr. <HI>Moor,</HI> one of the late Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ely,</HI> upon going down the River in the Town's Barge with the Magi&s;trates, ob&s;erved it, and made Enquiry after it. And being told, that it was built by the <HI>Keelmen</HI> them&s;elves (every one allowing towards it a <HI>Penny a Tide</HI>) he &s;aid, that he had heard of, and &s;een many Ho&s;pitals, the Works of <HI>rich Men;</HI> but that was the fir&s;t he ever &s;aw or heard of, which had been built by the Poor. 'Tis a great Pity that the De&s;ign of its Building is not throughly an&s;wer'd; but there are &s;ome Mi&s;creants, who would rather &s;tarve in Sickne&s;s or old Age, than not guzzle a Penny in their Health and Youth.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. VI. <HI>Of the</HI> Suburbs <HI>of</HI> SANDGATE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Suburbs of <HI>Sandgate</HI> (excepting &s;ome Hou&s;es nigh the Walls of the Town) we are informed e&s;cap'd the Fury of the Civil Wars. This Street has it's Name from it's Situation, which is upon the Sand. For this whole Street as well as the <HI>Sandhill,</HI> and all the lower Parts of the Town in ancient Times was the Common Sand or Shore of the River.</P>
<P>THIS Street has in it a va&s;t Number of narrow Lanes on each Side of it, which are crouded with Hou&s;es. It is chiefly inhabited by People that work upon the <HI>Water,</HI> particularly the <HI>Keelmen.</HI> The Number of Souls in this Street and the Lanes belonging to it, is computed to &s;everal Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of this Street is an open Place called the <HI>Squirrel,</HI> from a little Brook of that Name, which runs through it into the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which was the ancient Bounds of the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> From this, as far as the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Cook,</HI> Shipwright, is the Street of <HI>Sandgate,</HI> then we enter St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Street, (&s;o called from the neighbouring Chapel) which leads us on to the <HI>Ropery,</HI> which is a long and plea&s;ant Walk, giving an agreeable Pro&s;pect of the River, and a great Part of the Town and Neighbouring Places. What this Ropery was formerly, <HI>Grey</HI> gives us the be&s;t Account. Below Ea&s;t, &s;ays he, is the Balla&s;t-Hill, where Women upon their Heads car|ried Balla&s;t, which was taken forth of the &s;mall Ships which came empty for Coals; which Place was the fir&s;t Balla&s;t Shore out of the Town; &s;ince which Time, the Trade increa&s;ing, there are many Balla&s;t Shores below the Water, on both Sides of the River; much the &s;ame Account is given of this, in the Manu&s;cript &s;o frequently mentioned; the Hoa&s;tmen got Leave at fir&s;t to lead Coals above the <HI>Bourn,</HI> and that occa&s;ioned their Delivery of Balla&s;t upon the <HI>Lime-Kiln</HI> Road, and the Women bore the Balla&s;t upon their Heads, and made the Balla&s;t-Hills; for the Town had procured all that Shore of the Lords of <HI>Byker</HI> for that U&s;e, and to build Lime-Kilns upon.</P>
<P>ON the North of this Ropery &s;tands the Chapel of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> which is a a Chapel of Ea&s;t to the Church of <HI>All-hallows,</HI> which tho' pretty large is yet much too little for the Pari&s;h, it being perhaps one of the large&s;t Pari&s;hes in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHEN it was originally built I have met with nothing that gives any Ac|count. after the Reformation it was neglected and came into Decay; but the Town in the Year 1682. repair'd it, and &s;ettled a Lecturer there, to preach in the Morning, and to expound the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> every Sunday Afternoon; which the Town allow'd 30 <HI>l.</HI> per Annum for; at the Opening of it, after it was repaired, the Rev. Mr. <HI>March,</HI> then Vicar of the Town, preached the fir&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="166">
Sermon, in it, which was Printed, and Intitled, <HI>Th'</HI> Encaenia <HI>of St.</HI> Ann<HI>'s Cha|pel in</HI> Sandgate.</P>
<P>IT has at pre&s;ent two Lecturers, which are paid by the Town, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clayton,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Maddi&s;on;</HI> to the former the Town pays 40 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and to the latter 50 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>BELOW this to the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e-bridge are the Hou&s;es of Ship-Wrights, and Ma&s;ter-Builders, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Thomas Wallas,</HI> Mr. <HI>Roger Durham,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Lattany,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cuthbert Pre&s;ton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;e-bridge,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e of the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;es</HI> which are al|mo&s;t contiguous to it, was originally a Wood-Bridge, as the Bridge higher up the <HI>Bourn</HI> was, 'till within the&s;e 6 or 7 Years; but in the Year 1669, when <HI>Ralph Jeni&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was Mayor, it was made of Stone by <HI>Thomas Wrang|ham,</HI> Ship-Wright, on Account of Lands which the Town let him; The Pa&s;&s;age however over it was very difficult and uneven 'till the Year 1729, When <HI>Stephen Coul&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was Mayor, it was made level and commodious both for Hor&s;e and Foot.</P>
<P>ON the other Side of the Bridge are the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;es,</HI> which in <HI>Grey</HI>'s Time &s;erved mo&s;t Part of the Kingdom with Window-Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>SOMETIME in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> came over to <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the <HI>Henzels, Tyzacks</HI> and <HI>Tytorys.</HI> The Rea&s;on of their coming hither was the Per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants in their own Country, of who&s;e Per|&s;ua&s;ion they were. They were by Occupation Gla&s;s-makers. At their fir&s;t coming to this Town they wrought in their Trade at the Clo&s;e-gate, after that they removed into <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> from whence they removed again and &s;ettled upon the River Side at the Place called from their abiding in it the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;es.</HI> De&s;ervedly therefore have &s;o many of the&s;e Families been named <HI>Peregrines</HI> from the Latin Word <HI>Peregrinus</HI> which &s;ignifies a Pilgrim or a Stranger.</P>
<P>HAVING at la&s;t &s;ettled here they became very numerous, and generally married into each others Families to pre&s;erve the three Names of <HI>Henzel, Ty|zack</HI> and <HI>Tytory.</HI> But the latter of them within this Few Years became ex|tinct. There are of the <HI>Tyzacks</HI> &s;everal remaining; but the <HI>Henzels</HI> are mo&s;t numerous.</P>
<P>AS you go from the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, you come now to the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;es,</HI> a large Village, and pa&s;s by the We&s;tern Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, then to the Crown-Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, then to the middle Bottle-hou&s;e, then to the middle Broad-hou&s;e, then to the ca&s;tern Gla&s;s-hou&s;e. Nigh this la&s;t is the Hou&s;e of the late Mr. <HI>Peregrine Henzel,</HI> the principal Per&s;on then remaining of his Family, and one of the Chief Owners of the&s;e Works.</P>
<P>FROM hence we pa&s;s over the Grounds of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> to a Place con&s;i|&s;ting of &s;everal Hou&s;es, which from a Chapel here &s;ituated, dedicated to St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> is called St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, or Mu&s;hroom-Gla&s;s-hou&s;e; there is al&s;o here a Bottle Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, now held under the Town by Mrs. <HI>Middle|ton,</HI> of which <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is an Owner.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Chapel, or Chantery as it is called, is &s;aid to have been built by one of the Earls of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> No Doubt that Prayers might be put up for his Soul, and the Souls of his Family.</P>
<P>AT the Reformation it had Fate of many Chapels of the like Kind; to have its Revenues di&s;po&s;ed of, and it&s;elf left to fall into Ruins.</P>
<P>IT was dependant upon the Priory of St. <HI>John</HI>'s of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It was gran|ted

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable in this Place when the Coal Trade is brisk, that all other Bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o too; and when it is otherwi&s;e, through the Contracts of the Coal Owners, or of the Ma&s;ters, that there is a certain Deadne&s;s in all Tra|fick. It is the Money ari&s;ing from the Coal Trade, that almo&s;t entirely Cir|culates in this great Town and adjacent Country.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Fleetwood Precio&s;um Chronicon 118. p.</NOTE> &s;ome, that Sea Coal has not been in U&s;e above 150 Years, at lea&s;t not in <HI>London;</HI> and that when we meet with Coals in old Accounts, it is meant of Charcoal. I can &s;carce be of this Opinion, if it was but for what the &s;aid Authority him&s;elf acknowledgeth, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Carbo Ma|rinus,</HI> or Sea Coal, is mentioned in <HI>Matthew Paris.</HI> And in the 1&s;t of <HI>Edward</HI> III. there is mention made <HI>de Carbonibus marithnis,</HI> of Sea Coals and the Mea|&s;ure of them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, nigh this Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Coals were work'd very early, in a Charter of King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. dated <HI>Dec.</HI> 1, 23d of that King's Reign, Licence was granted to the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to dig Coals in the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Field</HI> and the <HI>Frith.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Year 1421, the 9th of <HI>Hen.</HI> V. Two-pence per Chaldron being paid to the King for all Coals &s;old at the Port of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to People not enfran|chi&s;ed; it was enacted that the Keels &s;hould be of the Burthen of 20 Chal|drons, and no more, according to Cu&s;tom; &s;ome being of the Burthen of 22, and &s;ome of 24 Chaldrons built, to defraud the King of his Cu&s;toms, and that the Keels &s;hould be &s;ealed by the King's Officers. <HI>De. reb.</HI> 39.</P>

<P>THIS Place is generally computed to vend upwards of 300,000 Chaldrons a-Year.

Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> thinks it a Place of equal Antiquity with <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> becau&s;e of it's ancient Name <HI>Gabro&s;entum;</HI> but I have already proved it more rational to believe it to have been only it's Suburbs.</P>
<P>THERE was an ancient Mona&s;try here in the Time of <HI>Bede;</HI> which was the Mona&s;try of <HI>Utanus,</HI> it was where Mr. <HI>Riddle</HI>'s Hou&s;e, or <HI>Gate&s;head</HI> Hou&s;e is as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>ON the 14 of <HI>May,</HI> 1080, <HI>Walter</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham</HI> was murdered at this Place. The Occa&s;ion of it was, this <HI>Walter</HI> attending more wordly Affairs than the Charge of his Flock, gave him&s;elf altogether to Temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s, wherein he wholly occupied him&s;elf. He bought of the King the Earldom of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and then making him&s;elf a &s;ecular Judge, took upon him to &s;it in the Court, and to determine all Cau&s;es at his Plea&s;ure, dealing withal very corruptly, and taking &s;till the Cour&s;e that might be mo&s;t for his own
<PB N="167" REF="178">
Gain. Hereupon he greatly enriched his own Coffers, but purcha&s;ed unto him|&s;elf extreme Hatred among&s;t the Common People, which was his De&s;truction in the End. There was a certain Gentleman, of great Account, named <HI>Leul|fus,</HI> that married <HI>Algitha,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Aldred,</HI> &s;ometime Earl of <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI> from whom the Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> that now liveth is lineally de&s;cend|ed. This <HI>Leulfus,</HI> to the end he might live near the Church in his latter Time, and for very Devotion, came to <HI>Durham</HI> to dwell there, and kept Company very much with the Bi&s;hop, who loved him entirely, for many good Parts he &s;aw in him, as namely, his Wi&s;dom in di&s;cerning, his Equity in deciding, and his Di&s;cretion in ordering and handling &s;uch Cau&s;es as he committed unto him; in which Re&s;pect al&s;o he u&s;ed him very familiarly, employed him often, and gave him what Countenance he could. Now, you &s;hall under&s;tand, that unto the &s;ame Bi&s;hop belonged two Men, unto whom for the mo&s;t Part he committed the ordering of all his Affairs; <HI>Leofwyn</HI> or <HI>Leobwyn</HI> his Chaplain, whom he tru&s;ted with all Hou&s;hold-Matters, and <HI>Gil|bert,</HI> a Kin&s;man of his own, that dealt in his Cau&s;es of Temporal Govern|ment. In their Offices they behaved them&s;elves &s;o, as the Bi&s;hop had Cau&s;e to commend their Diligence, but to blame their Ra&s;hne&s;s and Wilfulne&s;s in many Things, which notwith&s;tanding he bore withal, either becau&s;e their Indu&s;try and Care of his Affairs, &s;o blinded his Eyes, as he could not e&s;py their Misbehaviour otherwi&s;e, or el&s;e being loath to dete&s;t them whom he had once advanced. The&s;e Men, and e&s;pecially <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> did greatly envy the Credit that <HI>Leulfus</HI> had gotten with the Bi&s;hop, and every where oppo&s;ed them&s;elves again&s;t him, not only in Words, traducing his Actions, but in Deeds al&s;o, thwarting and cro&s;&s;ing his Endeavours, whereby it came to pa&s;s, that many Jars fell out between them. One Day among&s;t the re&s;t, a Court being held in the Pre&s;ence of the Bi&s;hop, <HI>Leofwyn</HI> or <HI>Leobwyn</HI> (for &s;o al&s;o I find him called) according to his wonted Manner, gave <HI>Leulfus</HI> ill Speeches, which he not enduring to bear, as heretofore he had done <HI>(furor fit &s;aepius lae|&s;a patientia)</HI> an&s;wered this &s;awcy Chaplain &s;omewhat more roundly than he had been accu&s;tomed. Whereupon he ro&s;e &s;traight from the Court in great Indignation (<HI>Leofwyn</HI> I mean) and calling <HI>Gilbert</HI> a&s;ide, with little ado per|&s;uaded him to carry a certain Number of armed Men to the Hou&s;e where <HI>Leulfus</HI> lay, and in a Night to kill him; which indeed he performed with great Cruelty, murdering not only the innocent Gentleman him&s;elf, but al&s;o his Servants and whole Hou&s;hold. The News of this horrible and outragi|ous Cruelty coming unto the Ears of the Bi&s;hop, amazed him very much, and &s;u&s;pecting it was done by the Advice of <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> turning about unto him: <HI>O</HI> Leofwyn, &s;aith he, <HI>thou ha&s;t already &s;lain me by thy Tongue.</HI> So not doubting it would breed much Danger unto him, he got into his Ca&s;tle, and pre&s;ently di&s;patched Me&s;&s;engers unto the Friends and Kindred of <HI>Leulfus</HI> that was &s;lain, prote&s;ting, that the Fact was committed without his Knowledge; that he was marvellous &s;orry for it; and if any Man &s;u&s;pected him, would be ready to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to any Order of Law, whereby he might clear him|&s;elf. Herewith they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied; but for Conclu&s;ion of a firm Peace among&s;t them, it was thought fit they &s;hould meet and con&s;ider of the Matter. They met at a Place called <HI>Goats-Head;</HI> the Bi&s;hop for his better Safe-guard betook him&s;elf unto the Church with his Company; the People (whereof an infinite Number were gathered together) abode without. Me&s;|&s;ages a while pa&s;t between them; but the more the Matter was debated (be|ing very odious of it&s;elf) the more the People were incen&s;ed. At la&s;t it was told them, how not only <HI>Leofwyn,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Gilbert</HI> had been harboured in the Bi&s;hop's Hou&s;e, and afforded Countenance by him &s;ince the Murder; which being once heard (and it was true enough) they all cried out, it was mani|fe&s;t that the Bi&s;hop was the Author of this Fact. It is furthermore delivered by <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> that the Bi&s;hop not only before this, among&s;t many intol|lerable Exactions laid upon the Country by him, had commanded the Sum of 400 <HI>l.</HI> to be levied at this Time. That being al&s;o remembred, while as all the People &s;tood in a murmuring, doubting what Cour&s;e to take, one of &s;ome &s;pecial Regard among&s;t them &s;lept up, u&s;ing the&s;e Words, <HI>Short read, Good read, &s;lay ye the Bi&s;hop.</HI> Hereupon, without more ado, they ran all unto the
<PB N="168" REF="179">
Church, killed &s;o many of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s Retinue as they found without Doors, and with horrible Noi&s;e and Outcries, bid him and his Company to come out unto them. Too late then he repented, that he had committed him&s;elf unto the Fury of a di&s;contented Multitude, with whom he knew him&s;elf before that Time nothing gracious. But to make the be&s;t of a bad Match, and to try all Means of ridding him&s;elf from the Danger imminent, he per&s;uaded his Kin&s;man <HI>Gilbert,</HI> there pre&s;ent, to go forth unto them, if happily his Death (which doubtle&s;s he had de&s;erved) might &s;atisfy their Fury, and purcha&s;e Safety unto his Lord and Ma&s;ter. <HI>Gilbert</HI> was content, and i&s;&s;uing out, with divers of the Bi&s;hop's Company, were all &s;lain, except only two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> Servants unto the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (all the re&s;t were <HI>Normans</HI>). They being not yet &s;atisfied, he be&s;ought <HI>Leofwyn</HI> (who&s;e Life he knew well was principally &s;ought) to go out al&s;o. But he utterly refu&s;ed &s;o to do. The Bi&s;hop there|fore going unto the Church-door, entreated them not to take his Life from him, prote&s;ting him&s;elf to be utterly guiltle&s;s of the Blood of <HI>Leulfus;</HI> and &s;hewed them at large, how dangerous it would be to them in particular, and what Inconvenience would follow to the whole Country in general, if they &s;hould defile their Hands in &s;hedding his Blood, an unarmed Prie&s;t, a &s;acred and con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop, their Ruler, their Governor, their Magi&s;trate. Hoping, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That his very Countenance, his Gravity, his Age, and the Sight of his Per&s;on might move them to Compa&s;&s;ion (for he was indeed a very reve|rend Man to &s;ee to, very tall of Stature, Head and Beard as white as Snow, his Face fre&s;h and well coloured, and every Way very per&s;onable, he went out, carrying a green Branch in his Hand, that &s;o he might te&s;tify his De&s;ire of Peace. When he &s;aw that all this availed not, and the People ran furiou&s;ly upon him, he ca&s;t his Gown over his own Head, in like Sort as we read <HI>Ju|lius Cae&s;ar</HI> did in the like Ca&s;e, and permitting him&s;elf to their Fury, with in|numerable Wounds was pitifully ma&s;&s;acred, together with all his People and Retinue, to the Number of an hundred; only <HI>Leofwyn</HI> yet remained within the Church, and being often called, would not come forth; &s;o they &s;et the Church on Fire. Not enduring the Fire, he leaped out of a Window, and was immediately hewn into a thou&s;and Pieces. The Monks of <HI>Yarrow</HI> came and fetched away the Bi&s;hop's Body (which they found &s;tark naked) and could hardly know it for the Multitude of Wounds; they carried it to their Mona&s;tery, from whence it was conveyed to <HI>Durham,</HI> and there buried on the South-&s;ide of the Chapter-hou&s;e, but &s;ecretly, for Fear of the Murderers, that roved up and down the Town, and once a&s;&s;aulted the Ca&s;tle. When they found that they could not prevail there, they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves, and for the mo&s;t Part came to evil and unhappy Ends. The King in the mean Time hearing of this Tumult, &s;ent his Brother <HI>Odo</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bayan,</HI> with many of his Nobles, and a great Army, to take Puni&s;hment of this Murder, which while they &s;ought to revenge, they brought the whole Country to De&s;olation. Tho&s;e that were guilty prevented the Danger toward them by Flight, &s;o as few of them could be taken; of the re&s;t that &s;tayed at Home, &s;ome were unju&s;tly executed, and the re&s;t compelled to ran&s;om them&s;elves to their utter impoveri&s;hing and undoing. The chiefe&s;t Doer in this Outrage, was one <HI>Eadul&s;us,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Rus,</HI> de&s;cended of the Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who (as &s;ome &s;ay) &s;lew the Bi&s;hop with his own Hands, and afterwards by the ju&s;t Judgment of God, was him&s;elf &s;lain by a Woman, and his Body, tho' once buried in the Church of <HI>Godworth,</HI> was taken up by the Command|ment of <HI>Turgo&s;t,</HI> Prior of <HI>Durham,</HI> and forbidden Chri&s;tian Burial. At this Time <HI>Odo</HI> took away from the Church of <HI>Durham</HI> certain Ornaments of great Value, among&s;t which is e&s;pecially remembred a certain Cro&s;ier of ine&s;timable Price. In this Bi&s;hop's Days, and by his Endeavour, &s;ecular Clerks were di&s;|placed, and the Church of <HI>Durham</HI> repleni&s;hed with Monks, the Pope, the King, and the Archbi&s;hop allowing this Alteration, <HI>Goodwyn, Fol.</HI> 637.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS this Church was new built, and placed where it now &s;tands: For, according to Tradition, it &s;tood before in the Field below where Brick-Kilns now are.</P>

<P>Know ye, that we have granted, and by his pre&s;ent Deed have granted to our Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Gate&s;heved,</HI> full Liberty of Fore&s;tage, yielding in every half Year, from <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI> to the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Martin;</HI> for a Wheye or Ox, the which goes to Gra&s;s, 2 <HI>d.</HI> and for a Hor&s;e 2 <HI>d.</HI> and for every Hog 1 <HI>d.</HI> in re|&s;pect of all Things that they have to proper and nece&s;&s;ary U&s;es; &s;aving the&s;e prohibited. Neither &s;hall it be lawful for any Fore&s;ter within the Meats that are appointed within our Fore&s;t and Burrough to Tax Lands upon any Burge&s;s, or upon any Manner of Thing of the &s;aid Borough, or upon any Oxen, or any other their Cattle, or by any Ways to hinder them, either of their Wood, Tim|ber, or any other Things. And if any Suit or Trouble &s;hall be between the Fore&s;ters and Burge&s;&s;es, it &s;hall be determined in the &s;aid Burrough, if it may be; if not, then in our Pre&s;ence it &s;hall be determined. And the Cattle of any Burge&s;s &s;hall not be carried out of the &s;aid Burrough, but there &s;hall be reple|vied, if the &s;ame may be replevied. To the &s;ame Burge&s;&s;es it &s;hall be lawful to have Herbage, and lying Turfs and Bruery to their own proper U&s;es, where|&s;oever they are accu&s;tomed to have the &s;ame, &s;o that they &s;ell us Part thereof. And if any Burge&s;s do dig Turfs for his Chimney, not having Oxen; if for the Leading of Turfs they &s;hall be forced to have Oxen, neverthele&s;s in giving for all or every Ox, which they &s;hall need 2 <HI>d.</HI> of Fore&s;tage, they &s;hall be freed. And it &s;hall be lawful for every Burge&s;s to give Wood to whom&s;oever he will,
<PB N="172" REF="183">
to be &s;pent about the River of <HI>Tyne,</HI> without any Licence; but not to &s;ell any without Licence of the Fore&s;ters. And no Fore&s;ter &s;hall di&s;turb any Mer|chandize that cometh within the &s;aid Meat. And every Burge&s;s of <HI>Gate&s;heved</HI> &s;hall have of his Burgage the &s;ame Liberty, which the Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> have of their Burgages. And whither&s;oever the Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Gate&s;heved,</HI> or their Cattle, &s;hall come within our Land, in the Peace of God and Ble&s;&s;ed St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> they &s;hall pa&s;s, that no Man to them &s;hall do any Injury, or any De|mand or Exaction of them &s;hall require. We do grant al&s;o to the &s;ame Bur|ge&s;&s;es, that they &s;hall have Common of Pa&s;ture and like Parts of Feeding to all their Hou&s;es, and all Commodities which they ought to have of <HI>Subtwell Meadows,</HI> as they were wont to have; as in Deeds of good Memory of our Predece&s;&s;ors rea&s;onably is contain'd.</P>
<P>IN the 7th of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. the Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> peti|tioned the King, that the Town of <HI>Gate&s;heved</HI> in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> ad|joining to their Corporation, only the River of <HI>Tyne</HI> between, being popu|lous, and without Government, and often committing many Outrages in their Town, and then got over the Water into the Town of <HI>Gate&s;heved</HI> unpuni&s;hed; and that often they ca&s;t Rubbi&s;h into the River; and al&s;o that the Bridge went to Decay very much, which belonged to that Town; humbly be&s;eech|ing, That his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to incorporate that Town with them, under their Government, with all its Members, and Salt-mea|dows, and Park; and that it might be quite taken from the County of <HI>Dur|ham,</HI> and all the People therein to become &s;ubordinate to their Laws.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON it was enacted, the whole Town of <HI>Gate&s;heved,</HI> with the Salt-Meadows, the whole Water and Bridge, with all the Liberties there|unto belonging (except the Common which &s;hould remain to the Inhabi|tants) &s;hould be incorporated with <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and disjoined from the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> as <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> was from <HI>Northumberland</HI> by Charter, <HI>Gardener,</HI> p. 169.</P>
<P>FIRST <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as Bi&s;hop <HI>Tun&s;tal</HI> was created Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> he petitioned her Maje&s;ty, to re&s;tore <HI>Gate&s;heved</HI> to the County of <HI>Durham</HI> again, and that the &s;aid Act 7th <HI>Edward</HI> VI. might be repealed; and it was repealed accordingly, and enacted, that the Town of <HI>Gate&s;heved</HI> &s;hould be free from the Corporation of <HI>Newca&s;tle, &amp;c. Gardener,</HI> p. 175.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ame Side of the <HI>Tyne,</HI> a little below, are the Fields called the <HI>Salt-Meadows.</HI></P>
<P>IN going down the Water, we meet with &s;everal Staiths, &s;uch are the Staith of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Matthew White,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e Bridge; the Staiths of <HI>Richard Ridley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Keys, of <HI>Walter Blacket,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>John Wilkin&s;on;</HI> of <HI>Francis Rud&s;ton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and of <HI>Edward Wortley Montague,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> We meet al&s;o with &s;everal Keys, &s;uch are <HI>Winkemley, Bill-Key, Willington-Key, Hebbourn-Key,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE meet al&s;o with &s;everal Villages, &s;uch are <HI>Dents-Hole,</HI> St. <HI>Anthon</HI>'s, <HI>Snowdon</HI>'s <HI>Hole, Howdon Panns, Jarroiv,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Hoa&s;tmen renewed their Charter, they had Licence to &s;end Coals above the Bill, and Mr. <HI>Coal</HI> procured a Shore at <HI>Friar-Goo&s;e,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hen|ry Chapman</HI> procured a Shore upon <HI>Hewith</HI>-Grounds; and Mr. <HI>Robert Brand|ling</HI> with much ado got Leave to build a Shore upon his own Ground at <HI>Fel|lin.</HI> In the mean time, the Tenants of the Dean and Chapter at <HI>Durham,</HI> took Liberty to throw their A&s;hes into the River, which did much Damage to the Bar. Upon this Mr. <HI>Leonard Carr,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cuthbert Bewick</HI> com|plained, and the Town cau&s;ed them to lay them upon the Land, of which they have made mighty Heaps.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="184">WHEN King <HI>James</HI> I. came to the Crown, he was plea&s;ed to be bounti|ful to his Countrymen; among&s;t the re&s;t, Sir <HI>Henry Gibb</HI> being one of his Officers, he be&s;towed upon him the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Jarrow</HI> and he would have procured a Shore there to ca&s;t Balla&s;t; but altho' he had the Favour of the King, yet the Town u&s;ed &s;uch Means, and gave &s;uch Rea&s;ons to his Maje&s;ty and the Council, that they found it detrimental to the Town, and e&s;pe|cially to the River, &s;o that he was utterly hindred and di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>BUT after the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Thomas Bonner,</HI> and <HI>Robert Elli|&s;on</HI> got in to be Magi&s;trates; and the&s;e Men having gotten Wealth and Increa&s;e by the Rebellion, did purcha&s;e <HI>Jarrow;</HI> and what could not be done before in a lawful Time, they did bring to pa&s;s at this unlawful Juncture, building a Shore, and ca&s;ting Balla&s;t, to the great Detriment of the River: And hav|ing the Town at Command, Mr. <HI>Bonner</HI> bought St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s, and <HI>Robert Elli&s;on</HI> bought <HI>Hebbourn,</HI> and there they both built Shores, and got the Allowance of the Common Council, when they were beyond Re&s;i&s;ting: And &s;ince that, Mr. <HI>Carr,</HI> a Man that de&s;erved well of his pre&s;ent Maje|&s;ty [<HI>CHARLES</HI> II.] and the Town, hath procured, that his Brother <HI>Elli&s;on</HI> (for old <HI>Elli&s;on</HI>'s Son married his Si&s;ter) &s;hould have Liberty to e|rect his Shore to a great Length, which in Time will utterly overthrow our Navigation; for they will damn out the In-draught, which maketh Rivers far off the Sea be walled out; it will go by, and not come in: And &s;ome ancient and di&s;creet Ma&s;ters of Ships have &s;aid, <HI>They have not left a Birth to &s;ave their Ships in, when any Land-&s;tood or Storm happens in the River.</HI> Mil|bank.</P>
<P>THE next Place <HI>Jarrow,</HI> or <HI>Girwy,</HI> as it was anciently called, which is a &s;mall Village on the South Side of <HI>Tyne,</HI> about 4 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Newca|&s;tle,</HI> famous for a Mona&s;tery of learned Men, but more &s;o for the Birth, Life, and Death of <HI>venerable BEDE;</HI> &s;o named for his &s;ingular Sanctity, who was born of mean Parents, and at &s;even Years of Age deliver'd to the holy Abbot St. <HI>Benedict</HI> to be educated in his Rule, and being come to Age he profe&s;&s;ed a Mona&s;tick Life in the Abbies of <HI>Weremouth,</HI> and <HI>Girwy,</HI> where he became by his con&s;tant Application to his Studies, &s;o compleat a Scholar, that few in that Age, (which bred many very learned Men) were to compare to him, for he was perfectly knowing in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and no le&s;s perfect in Poetry, Rhetorick, Logick, Phy&s;icks, Metaphy&s;ikcs, A&s;tronomy, Arithmetick, all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Calculations, Mu&s;ick, Geometry, Co&s;mogra|phy, Hi&s;tory, Philo&s;ophy, and Divinity. In &s;hort, he had an exact Know|ledge of all commendable Sciences, in&s;omuch that <HI>William of Malmsbury</HI> thus de&s;cribes him. He was a Man that may more worthily be admired than com|mended; for he was born in an extream Corner of the World, yet the Light of his Learning &s;pread over all Parts of the Earth, he continued a mo&s;t dili|gent Learner 'till he was thirty Years of Age, after which being ordained Prie&s;t, he betook him&s;elf to Teaching and Writing. All the Hours he had to &s;pare from the Mona&s;tical Exceri&s;es of Prayer, and Singing in the Choirs by Day and Night (in which he was con&s;tant and very devout) he mo&s;t dili|gently &s;pent in his Studies, &s;o that his Life was a continual Intercour&s;e be|tween Devotion and Study, he never repairing to his Study 'till he had been at Prayers, nor ever went to Prayers but from his Studies, by which continual Application he penetrated into all Sciences. In his continual Deportment he was &s;o grave and &s;erious, that the Title of <HI>Venerable</HI> was be&s;towed on him while he lived, and ever continued to him after his Death. It appears from Hi&s;tory that he had at one Time tho&s;e great Lights of the Church, <HI>Alcuinus,</HI> Preceptor to the Emperor <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> and <HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Clemens,</HI> the Foun|ders of the Univer&s;ities of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Pavia</HI> for his Scholars.</P>
<P>THIS Character is fully verified by the Books of all Sorts of Learning writ by him. At the End of his Works he gives us a mode&s;t account of his own
<PB N="174" REF="185">
Life, together with a Catalogue of his Principal Works. <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hunting|ton</HI> gives us al&s;o a large Catalogue of his Writings, too long to be &s;et down here: Yet we cannot omit &s;ome of the Principal Works, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>AN incredible Number of Treati&s;es upon all Parts of the Old and New Te&s;tament, many of which are &s;till to be found in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE an hundred Homilies, and many Pieces of Divinity and Devotion.</P>
<P>A Small Book of the Holy-Land.</P>
<P>A Chronicle from the Creation.</P>
<P>A Book of the Writers of the Church.</P>
<P>A Martyrology.</P>
<P>AN Epitome of the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>OF the Scituation and wonderful Things of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lives of many holy Men and Abbots, with many others of all Sorts of Learning.</P>
<P>THIS mo&s;t excellent Per&s;on, being grown old in the Study of Learning, and all Chri&s;tian Virtues, grew weak and decripit for a Time, and at length on the Tue&s;day before <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> his Di&s;temper grew &s;o heavy upon him, that Nature yielded to it, and he died on <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> Day, in the &s;eventy &s;econd Year of his Age; But others &s;ay the Ninetieth, <HI>Anno</HI> 734, and was buried in his Mona&s;tery, but afterwards his Body was tran&s;lated to <HI>Durham. Magn' Brit' vol 3d,</HI> p. 750.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be admired that he &s;hould become &s;o learned in his Mona&s;tery, for in former Ages the greater Mona&s;teries were like Univer&s;ities, wherein not only Humanity, but all the Liberal Sciences, Philo&s;ophy, and Divinity were taught; in the Year 697, he received Deacons Orders from the Hands of <HI>John</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hexham</HI> afterwards called St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Beverley,</HI> and in the Year 706 he was ordained Prie&s;t by the &s;ame Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>AMONG the &s;everal Ways of accounting for his Epithet of <HI>Venerable,</HI> it has always been e&s;teemed the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, though perhaps not the mo&s;t true Account, of what is &s;aid to have happened after his Death, <HI>viz.</HI> that one of his Scholars de&s;igning to make his Epitaph in Hexameter Ver&s;e, which began thus, <HI>Hac &s;unt in Fo&s;&s;a,</HI> and was willing to make it end <HI>Presbiteri o&s;&s;a;</HI> But it would not do, at la&s;t being tired out he fell a&s;leep, and in the Morning to his great Surprize he found it &s;tand thus,

<P>NOW the great Churches when the &s;aving Light of the Go&s;pel began to Shine abroad in the World (for it is not impertinent to note thus much) were called <HI>Ba&s;ilicae,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Ba&s;ilicae</HI> of the Gentiles, namely tho&s;e &s;tate|ly Buildings where the Magi&s;trates held the Courts of Ju&s;tice, were converted to Churches by the Chri&s;tians; whence <HI>Au&s;onius, Ba&s;ilica olim negotiis plena, nunc votis,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Ba&s;ilica</HI> full of Bu&s;ine&s;s heretofore, but now of De|votion or el&s;e, becau&s;e they were built in an oblong Form as the <HI>Ba&s;ilicae</HI> were.</P>

<P>I have, &s;ays he, in his Letter to the Royal Society, with much Trouble, got into my Hands a Piece of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquity, which was but a very few Years ago di&s;covered upon the South-bank of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> near <HI>Sheilds,</HI> in the Bi&s;hoprick; it is a very large and fair <HI>Roman</HI> Altar, of one intire Stone; but after all my Co&s;t and Pains, I am very &s;orry to find the In&s;cription very ill defaced, and much of it is not legible, and I believe it has been al&s;o much mi&s;handled by tho&s;e who have endeavoured to read it; whereas if the Remain|der of the Letters had been exactly mea&s;ured, and the Face blacked, and light|ly wa&s;hed off again, as in Prints, &s;ome Things more might have been &s;pelled.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of the Stone it&s;elf, it is of a coar&s;e Rag, the &s;ame with that of the Pyramids at <HI>Burrow-Briggs;</HI> it is four Foot high, and was a&s;cended to by Steps, which appeareth in all the Sides; but the Front has two Square-holes near the Bottom, which let in the Irons that joined it to the Steps.</P>
<P>I have carefully de&s;igned it on all its Sides, and given the Plan of the Top al&s;o, which if you plea&s;e, we will &s;urvey in Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Back-&s;ide, oppo&s;ite to the In&s;cription, on which is engraven in Ba&s;s-Relief, a Flower-Pot, furni&s;hed I &s;uppo&s;e, with what be&s;t plea&s;ed the
<PB N="177" REF="188">
Stone-Cutter; for the&s;e Men needed not be more curious than the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, who were wont to make U&s;e of Herbs next Hand, to adorn the Altars, and therefore <HI>Verbenae</HI> is put for any Kind of Herb; yet if we will have it re&s;emble any Thing with us, I think it is mo&s;t like, if not truly <HI>Nym|phaea,</HI> a known and common River Plant.</P>
<P N="2">2. ONE of the Sides; which is &s;omewhat narrower than the Front or Back, On this are engraved in Ba&s;s-Relief, the cutting Knife <HI>(Cece&s;pita)</HI> and the Ax <HI>(&s;ecuris);</HI> the Knife is exactly the &s;ame with that on the other Altar, formerly by me mentioned in the Philo&s;ophical Collections of Mr. <HI>Hook;</HI> but the Ax is different, for here it is headed with a long and crooked Point, and there the Head of the Ax is divided into three Points.</P>
<P N="3">3. The other Side, on which are engraved after the &s;ame Manner, an Eure <HI>(Urceolus)</HI> and a Ladle which &s;erves for a <HI>Sympullum.</HI> This I call rather a Laddle than a Mallet, it being perfectly Di&s;h-wife, and hollow in the Middle, altho' <HI>Cambden</HI> is of another Opinion in that elegant Sculpt of the <HI>Cumberland</HI> Altar; and the very &s;ame Uten&s;il I have &s;een and noted on the <HI>Ickley</HI> Altar, which is yet extant at <HI>Middleton-Grange,</HI> near that Town; but the Stone which <HI>Cambden</HI> &s;ays &s;upports a Pair of Stairs there (as at this Day it does in the very Road) is but an ill Copy of it, and not the Original.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Plan of the Top, which is cut in the Figure of a Ba&s;on (<HI>Di&s;ons</HI> or <HI>Lana</HI>) with <HI>An&s;ae</HI> on each Side, con&s;i&s;ting of a Pair of Links of a Chain, which re&s;t upon, and fall over two Rowles; and this was the Hearth.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Front, which hath an In&s;cription in nine Lines in <HI>Roman</HI> Letters, each Letter a little more than two Inches deep of our Mea&s;ure, now remain|ing as in the prefixed Sculpture, Fig. 5. which I would read thus: <HI>Dis, De|abu&s;que Matribus, pro Salute M. Aurelii Antonii Augu&s;ti Imperatoris votum &s;ol|vit lubens merito ob reditum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deae Matres</HI> are well interpreted by <HI>Seldon.</HI> It is much his Safety and Return both vowed, &s;hould be &s;o &s;eparated in the In&s;cription; but I have not <HI>Gruter</HI> by me, to compare this with the like. <HI>Caracalla</HI> &s;ay the Hi&s;to|rians, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ziphilinus, Herodianus, &amp;c.</NOTE> after his Father's Death at <HI>York,</HI> took upon him the Command of the Army alone, and the whole Empire; he went alone again&s;t the Enemy, who were the <HI>Caledonii,</HI> inhabiting beyond the Wall which his Father had built, he made Peace with them, received their Ho&s;tages, &s;lighted their fortified Places, and returned. And this &s;eems to be confirmed by the In&s;cription; for undoubtedly, upon this la&s;t Expedition alone, without his Brother <HI>Gera</HI> and Mother, was this Altar erected to him alone, at a Place about two Sta|tions on this Side the Wall; &s;o that the Vow might be as well under&s;tood of his Return from this Expedition, as for his Sa&s;ety and Return to <HI>Rome,</HI> which methinks &s;hould be true, or his Mother and Brother <HI>Geta</HI> would &s;carce have been left out, at lea&s;t &s;o early, for yet the Army declared for them both, according to their Father's Will.</P>
<P>FURTHER, it &s;eems al&s;o to have been erected by tho&s;e who flattered him, and who were afterwards killed by him; and for this Rea&s;on, the Per|&s;ons who dedicated it, &s;eem to me to be Purpo&s;ely defaced, the &s;ixth and &s;eventh Lines of the In&s;cription being de&s;ignedly cut away by the Hollowne&s;s of them, and there not being the lea&s;t Sign of any Letter remaining. And this I &s;up|po&s;e might be Part of their Di&s;grace, as it was u&s;ual to deface and break the Statues and Monuments of Per&s;ons executed, of which this Mon&s;ter made &s;trange Havock; and &s;ince worn In&s;criptions admit of various Readings, be|cau&s;e &s;ome Letters are worn out, and &s;ome more legible, whereby unpreju|diced People may conceive them diver&s;ly; I will therefore tell you another reading, Part of the&s;e two fir&s;t Lines, which I do not di&s;allow, but that it will agree well enough with the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Severus,</HI> tho' his <HI>Apotheo&s;is,</HI> or &s;o|lemn

<P>SOUTH <HI>Shields</HI> is more famous for making Salt than North <HI>Shields,</HI> there being much the greater Number of Salt Pans; it is al&s;o a pretty large Town, and has a Church which going to decay, is about to be rebuilt.

<P>UNDER the <HI>Saxon</HI> Heptarchy this Place was called <HI>Tunaceltep,</HI> not as <HI>Bede</HI> affirms, from the Abbot <HI>Tunna,</HI> a mere romantick Story, which, if we recommend to the Reader, it mu&s;t be only for his Diver&s;ion, and not for any Truth in it, but from it's Situation on the River <HI>Tyne.</HI> Here was anciently

a little Mona&s;tery, which was frequently plundered by the <HI>Danes,</HI> while the <HI>Saxons</HI> ruled. <HI>Magn. Britan. p.</HI> 693.</P>
<P>AFTER the Decea&s;e of <HI>O&s;wyn,</HI> tho&s;e that had killed him brought his Bo|dy to the Mouth of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> and there buried it in the Oratory of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, in the Year 631.</P>
<P>IN this Place a Number of illu&s;trious Per&s;ons had gathered together, who in a regular Order attended divine Wor&s;hip; who thereby acquired &s;uch Ho|nour and E&s;teem, that when any one died of more than ordinary Reputation, who&s;e Funeral was to be &s;olemnized with more than common Honour, he was u&s;ually buried here.</P>
<P>THIS Mona&s;tery was de&s;troyed by <HI>Hinguar</HI> and <HI>Hubba.</HI> The Monks through Fear of Per&s;ecution, fled to a certain little Church of their own, which St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> had dedicated; but the <HI>Danes</HI> finding them out, burnt it and all that were in it.</P>
<P>AFTER that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had given to <HI>Robert Mowbray</HI> the County of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the Earl &s;hewed a deal of Re&s;pect to St. <HI>O&s;wyn,</HI> and the Church he was buried in (for the Church was founded within the Precincts of his Ca&s;tle). He gifted it with a Number of Lands, and placed in it Monks which came from St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and yet it is &s;aid by &s;ome that <HI>To&s;ti</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> laid the Foundation of this Mona&s;tery; but it's much more probable it was the former, becau&s;e he brought the Monks from St. <HI>Albans;</HI> but it will appear a great deal more likely when we come to the following Grant or Charter of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> for making of it a Cell to <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><P>Willielmus Rex Anglo|rum T.

<P>THIS Mona&s;tery being afterwards fortified, and turned into a &s;trong Hold, was called <HI>Tinmouth</HI>-Ca&s;tle; which Name it &s;till bears, and as &s;uch, glories both of its Stateline&s;s and Strength; (for as an ancient Author &s;peaks) it is inacce&s;&s;ibly &s;eated upon a very high Rock towards the Ocean on the Ea&s;t and North, and el&s;ewhere, &s;o well mounted, that a &s;lender Garri&s;on may make it good.

<P>JOHN of <HI>Whetham&s;tede,</HI> thirty third Abbot of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> was &s;o called from the Place of his Birth, a Village near St. <HI>Albans;</HI> but the Name of his Fa|mily was <HI>Bo&s;tock;</HI> he was a Monk of the Priory of <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> and gave, after he came to be Abbot, a Chalice of pure Gold, and of great Weight, to that Priory; his Character can't be better drawn up, than in <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Mona&s;ti|con, from whence we have this Account:
<Q><L>Contegit i&s;te lapis venerabilis o&s;&s;a <HI>Joannis</HI></L>

That is: <HI>This Stone covers the Bones of the Venerable</HI> John Wetham&s;tede, <HI>who was Abbot here in his Time, mo&s;t learned, a Lover of learned Men, and kind to them.</HI> He did not connive at any Faults in the Clergy; he was as zealous as <HI>Phineas</HI> again&s;t lewd Per&s;ons, and as <HI>John</HI> again&s;t Adulterers, and even as <HI>Pe|ter</HI> again&s;t Simoniacks.

He is recorded to have left behind him Ten thou&s;and Marks clear. Do you the Convent of St. <HI>Albans</HI> hourly pray for the Soul of him that loved you.</P>
<P>THIS famous Mona&s;tery, which was of the <HI>Benedictines</HI> Order, and con|&s;i&s;ted of a Prior and fifteen Monks, was &s;uppre&s;s'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 12th, in the 30th <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. It was valued at 397 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. converted the Ca&s;tle into a Defence and Fortification again&s;t foreign Inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE Ruins of the Mona&s;tery are &s;till to be &s;een in the Ca&s;tle, near which al&s;o was the Pari&s;h-Church; but that being gone much to Decay, and the Pari&s;hioners in the late Civil Wars being often debarred of the Liberty of a free Re&s;ort to it, another was begun to be re-built in the Year 1659; and be|ing afterwards fini&s;hed, was con&s;ecrated by Bi&s;hop <HI>Co&s;ins</HI> in the Year 1668. In the former Church we may &s;uppo&s;e it was, where <HI>Malcom</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> &s;lain with his Son <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by <HI>Robert Mowbray</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was buried.

<PB N="181" REF="192">
<HI>William</HI> did not pro&s;ecute his Revenge further, as he might have done with Succe&s;s, but e&s;tabli&s;hed his Son on his Throne, notwith&s;tanding the Endea|vours and De&s;ign of his Uncle <HI>Donald</HI> to deprive him of it, which he had done, had not King <HI>William</HI> aided him to obtain it.</P>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> was born in this Town, and is &s;aid to have been the Vicar of it, but afterwards became a <HI>Benedictine Monk</HI> in the Abbey of St. <HI>Albans;</HI> he was a mo&s;t virtuous Per&s;on, and excellently learned, entirely ad|dicted to the Study of the Holy Scriptures, and of &s;acred Hi&s;tory. He ga|thered the Lives and Actions of the Saints of <HI>England, Wales, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with great Judgment and indefatigable Labour, which Work he en|tituled, <HI>Sanctilogium &s;ervorum Dei,</HI> i. e. <HI>The &s;acred Hi&s;tory of the Servants of GOD.</HI> Nor did he de&s;erve le&s;s Commendation for his Expo&s;itions of the Holy Scripture, in which he not only explains the literal Sen&s;e, but the mo|ral, allegorical, and tropological; his Commentaries were upon all the Books from <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Kings</HI> inclu&s;ive. He wrote al&s;o other Books, as <HI>Church-Le&s;&s;ons, The Golden Hi&s;tory,</HI> and a <HI>Supplement</HI> to the &s;ame, an <HI>Appendix</HI> to his <HI>Martyrology,</HI> &amp;c. He flouri&s;hed about the Year 1366.</P>
<P>THE Church has perhaps been a Building of as much Art and Curio&s;ity, as any one in the whole Kingdom; nay, when we behold it at pre&s;ent, in the Mid&s;t of Ruins, we are &s;truck with Aw, and the utmo&s;t Veneration; whether it is a Reflection on the exten&s;ive Charity of ancient Days, the &s;ur|prizing Finene&s;s of the Ma&s;onry, or whether there is &s;omething naturally moving in tho&s;e ancient Remains; but &s;o it is, that it never fails to command a &s;olemn Aw, and a &s;ilent Commi&s;eration.</P>
<P><HI>TINMOUTH</HI> at pre&s;ent is a pretty large Village, and is much re&s;orted to in the Summer-Sea&s;on, it having the Prior's Haven in it, which is a mo&s;t convenient retired Place for Bathing.</P>

King</HI> John <HI>of</HI> Scotland <HI>having in Contempt of King</HI> Edward <HI>di&s;&s;ei&s;ed</HI> Magdulph <HI>Earl of</HI> Fife, <HI>and impri&s;on'd him;</HI> Magdulph <HI>complain'd to King</HI> Edward, <HI>who order'd King</HI> John <HI>to appear before him; but upon this Summons he appeared not. Upon this the King &s;ent out a &s;econd Writ, ordering him to appear before him</HI> 15 <HI>Days after</HI> Michaelmas, <HI>which was obey'd. Being come before him, he &s;eem'd not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the King's Su|periority, as he had been before; which was judged a Contempt and Di&s;obedience, and that three of his principal Ca&s;tles in</HI> Scotland <HI>&s;hould be &s;eized. But before the Pronunciation of the Sentence, He came before the King and his Council, and made Supplication to the King with his own Mouth; the King receiving this, with the Advice of his Council, and the Con&s;ent of</HI> Magdulph, <HI>granted his Prayer, and gave him Day untill his Parliament af|ter Ea&s;ter. But that Parliament was not holden that Day; however the Suit between the King of</HI> Scots <HI>and,</HI> Magdulph <HI>was continued, and prorogued to the next Parliament, which was &s;ummoned to be holden at St.</HI> Ed|mund<HI>'s</HI>-Bury, <HI>on the Fea&s;t of St.</HI> Martin <HI>in the Winter, in the year</HI> 1295.</P>
<P><HI>The Day being come, the King was pre&s;ent, and</HI> Magdulph <HI>&s;trenuou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted his Plea. But the King of</HI> Scot|land <HI>in&s;tead of appearing in Per&s;on, &s;ent the Abbot of</HI> Abirbrothock, <HI>and other Noblemen of that Kingdom, with not only frivolous excu&s;es, but to demand Satisfaction of King</HI> Edward <HI>for many and great Injuries, Oppre&s;&s;ions, and Grievances, &s;u&s;tained by the</HI> Scots <HI>from his Subjects. King</HI> Edward <HI>'s An&s;wer was, That for certain Cau|&s;es he was coming toward the</HI> North Parts, <HI>and that the King of</HI> Scots <HI>&s;hould then have &s;ufficient Recompence to his own Content. And then appointed him a Day to meet him at</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>upon</HI> Tyne, <HI>viz. The 1&s;t day of</HI> March <HI>next following, and ordered the Abbot and tho&s;e with him, to give Notice to their King that he &s;hould then per&s;onally appear. In the mean Time the King had certain Intelligence that the King of</HI> Scots <HI>with his Pre|lates, Earls, Barons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>had entred into a Confederacy with</HI> France; <HI>&s;o that the King of</HI> England <HI>upon this Account al&s;o, toward the Time appointed prepared for his Journey to</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>and &s;ent before him the Abbot of</HI> Newmin&s;ter <HI>and</HI> Wellebeck <HI>to the King of</HI> Scots, <HI>to give him Notice of the Adjournment and Time of his coming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the 1&s;t of</HI> March, 1296, <HI>the King was at</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>and &s;taid there many Days, expecting the King of</HI> Scots; <HI>he came not; the King of</HI> England <HI>removed nearer to</HI> Scotland, <HI>and came to</HI> Bamburgh, <HI>where he al&s;o &s;ummon'd him and expected him: He neither came, nor &s;ent to excu&s;e him&s;elf, but returned the Homage and Fealty for Him&s;elf and all his Kingdom to King</HI> Edward, <HI>by an In&s;trument or Writing, and defied him. After this he &s;ummon'd him again, but he would not appear; nay in&s;tead of that they proceed to Arms, enter</HI> England, <HI>plunder, burn, wa&s;te, kill and de&s;troy wherever they come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To obviate the&s;e In&s;olencies, and cha&s;ti&s;e them according to their De&s;erts, King</HI> Edward <HI>entred</HI> Scotland <HI>on Wedne&s;day in</HI> Ea&s;ter <HI>Week, be&s;ieged and took</HI> Berwick Ca&s;tle <HI>with a great Slaughter of the</HI> Scots; <HI>from thence he &s;ent Part of his Army to reduce the Ca&s;tle of</HI> Dunbarr, <HI>lately revolted, which was done, by the Death and De&s;truction of a great many</HI> Scots. <HI>Ten thou&s;ands,</HI> &s;ays my Author, <HI>&s;even Barons, an hundred Knights, and thirty one E&s;quires were taken in the Ca&s;tle; the Army coming to relieve it, Twenty two thou&s;and of them were &s;lain.

He order'd them to meet him &s;ome few Days after at</HI> Brechin, <HI>where they &s;ubmitted to his Mercy and Favour, without making any Terms or Conditions whatever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This done, King</HI> Edward <HI>cau&s;ed the Stone u&s;ed by the Kings of</HI> Scotland <HI>as a Throne, to be brought to</HI> We&s;t|min&s;ter, <HI>appointed</HI> John Warren <HI>Earl of</HI> Surrey <HI>and</HI> Su&s;&s;ex, <HI>Governour of</HI> Scotland, Hugh de Cre&s;&s;ingham, <HI>Trea&s;urer, and</HI> William Ormsby, <HI>Ju&s;ticiary, &s;ent King</HI> John Baliol <HI>to the Tower of</HI> London, <HI>where he was decently attended; and the Noblemen of</HI> Scotland, <HI>which he brought into</HI> England, <HI>were forbidden to pa&s;s the River</HI> Trent, <HI>under forfeiture of their Heads.</HI> Brady.

<ITEM><HI>Tho. Fleaminge</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> en|ter'd <HI>North|umberland,</HI> exerci&s;ing all Manner of Ho&s;tility, and wa&s;ting and Ravaging all before him, for about <HI>40</HI> Miles in length, 'till he came to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> which he re&s;olved to Be&s;iege, and &s;o &s;at down with all his Forces before it: The Captain of the Ca&s;tle was the Lord <HI>John Nevil</HI> of <HI>Hornby,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Conduct and Bra|very who re&s;olving to give the young King of <HI>Scotland</HI> a Ta&s;te of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Valour, as &s;oon as might be, com|manded <HI>200</HI> Lances to make a Sally very early next Morning. The&s;e da&s;hing &s;uddenly with great Fury into the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Hoa&s;t, on that Part where the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> was (who, as they &s;ay, was chief General for the Time, the King him&s;elf keeping private) took the Earl him&s;elf naked in Bed, dragg'd him away naked out of his Tent;
<PB N="197" REF="208">
and &s;o having &s;lain &s;everal of his Men, and won much Booty, they return'd all &s;afe into the Town with great Joy, and delivered the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> Pri&s;oner to their Captain. The Earl was a chief Prince of the Blood in <HI>Scotland,</HI> next of Quality to Prince <HI>Robert Stuart</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southerland;</HI> but for Valour and Conduct he yielded to None. This daring Enterprize having alarmed the whole Camp, the <HI>Scots</HI> ran like Madmen to the Barriers of the Town, and began a fierce A&s;&s;ault, which they continued a great while with much Pertinency. But they gain'd little and lo&s;t much. For there were many good Men of War within, who defended them&s;elves with much Re&s;olution and Di&s;cretion, &s;o that the <HI>Scots</HI> were at la&s;t fain to leave off their attac, and the Hopes of &s;uddenly revenging their Di&s;honour in that Place. Wherefore that bold and lucky Attempt of the Be&s;ieged being thus well back'd by a vigorous Defence, was &s;ufficient to per&s;uade King <HI>David</HI> and his Council, that to dally about <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> was dangerous, whereupon about Noon they decamp'd and went for <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Lord <HI>Nevil</HI> had &s;een for certain the Departure of the <HI>Scots,</HI> he gue&s;s'd their De&s;ign. Upon which he mounted a very &s;wift Gelding, and coa&s;ting wide of the <HI>Scots,</HI> rode Po&s;t Day and Night; 'till on the 5th Night he rode more than <HI>200</HI> Miles to <HI>Chert&s;ey</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> where at that Time King <HI>Edward</HI> lay, to whom he exactly related all he knew of the <HI>Scots,</HI> whereupon the <HI>King</HI> made all the Ha&s;te he could Northward.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the <HI>Scots</HI> a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Durham</HI> with all the Fury imaginable; for they were even &s;tark mad for the former Affront they had received at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> when they lo&s;t the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> &s;o di&s;honourably. They rear'd their Engines to ca&s;t Stones, and other Devices they had, whereby to approach the Walls under the Shelter of certain Machines, re&s;embling the ancient <HI>Te&s;tudo</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or the <HI>Syno&s;pi&s;mus</HI> of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and withall they had other Engines running upon Wheels, wherein on Lofts as high as the <HI>Walls</HI> at lea&s;t, there were <HI>Cro&s;s-Bows</HI> and others, who kept the Be&s;ieged from the Defences. So that after the A&s;&s;ault had been continual|ly renewed with all the Vigour imaginable, and on the other Hand maintained with incredible Ob&s;tinacy for <HI>6</HI> or <HI>7</HI> Days, the <HI>Scots</HI> entred the City by Force; at which Time King <HI>David</HI> in revenge of all his Lo&s;&s;es for &s;o many years preceding, e&s;pecially being urged beyond his Nature by the importunate In&s;tigations of his <HI>French</HI> Auxiliaries then with him, commanded his Captains to put all to Fire and Sword. There were Men, Women, and Children, old and young, Men of the Church, as <HI>Monks, Prie&s;ts, Canons,</HI> and others, holy and prophane, all without Pity or Di&s;tinction put to Death, neither <HI>Churches, Mona&s;teries,</HI> nor <HI>Shrines,</HI> no not that of St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> him|&s;elf (after it had repo&s;ed there for more than <HI>300</HI> years) could reconcile the incens'd Mind of the Soldiers to Pi|ty; not &s;o much as one Soul was left alive within the Place. So implacable and unmerciful is the Sword of War when &s;harpen'd with unchri&s;tian Cruelty.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Army got back to its own Country, the King of <HI>England</HI> was upon their Heels; but there were certain <HI>Noblemen</HI> on both Parts, who earne&s;tly labour'd to compo&s;e the Matters between the two <HI>Kings,</HI> which at la&s;t took &s;uch Effect, that a Truce was concluded for two years. <HI>Barns. Hi&s;t, Ed. III.</HI> p. <HI>254.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The following Letter I am obliged to Mr. Alderman <HI>REAY</HI> of this Town for.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PUr&s;uant to your Reque&s;t and my Promi&s;e I've been with Mr. <HI>Harle,</HI> and have met with the Pa&s;&s;age you mentioned relating to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the 119th Page of the fir&s;t Vol. of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luyt's Engli&s;h Voya|ges,</HI> &amp;c. printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1599, Fol. by which it appears that the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted K. <HI>Edw.</HI> III. with 17 Ships and 314 Men again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> a mo&s;t authentic and convincing Proof of the great Naval Strength of that Town in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>Another earlier In&s;tance of its being a Town famous for Trade in <HI>Edward</HI> II<HI>'s</HI> Time, is to be found in p. 142. and 143 of the &s;aid Vol. where we meet with an Order of the King and Council for the Sta|ple to be holden at a certain Place. This Order (relating to the Exportation of Wool) is directed to the Collectors of Cu&s;tom for Wool and Woolen Fells in the Port of <HI>London.</HI> The Title of it runs thus, <HI>De Stapula tenenda in certo loco ordinatio, Anno</HI> 13, Edwardi <HI>&s;ecundi;</HI> and the Order it&s;elf thus, <HI>Rex col|lectoribus cu&s;tumae canarum &amp; pellium canutarum in portu</HI> London <HI>&s;alutem,</HI> ending with the&s;e Words; <HI>Te&s;te Rege apud</HI> Doveram <HI>decimo octavo die</HI> Junii <HI>per ip&s;um Regem &amp; con&s;ilium;</HI> and immediately after is &s;ubjoin'd as follows; <HI>Et po&s;tmodum per breve de privato &s;igillo eodem modo mandatum e&s;t collectoribus Cu&s;tu|mae praedictae in Portubus &s;ub&s;criptis, videlicet.</HI>

<P>It would be as fatiguing as 'tis unnece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;cribe at length the &s;aid Order, which mu&s;t there|fore be omitted as well as the long Roll of the Engli&s;h Fleet contain'd in the 118, 119 and 120 Pages of the &s;aid Book; I &s;hall only tell you that the Account of the Fleet is thus in&s;crib'd.</P>
<P><HI>The Roll of the huge Fleet of</HI> Edward III. <HI>before</HI> Calice, <HI>extant in the King's great Wardrobe in</HI> London, <HI>whereby the wonderful Strength of</HI> England <HI>by Sea in tho&s;e Days may appear.</HI></P>
<P>This Li&s;t is divided into the South and North Fleet, the Beginning and End of both which I'll give you in the Author's own Words.

<ITEM>Sum of the <HI>North</HI> Fleet Mariners 4521</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I cannot leave this Li&s;t, without ob&s;erving to the great Honour of that loyal and brave Town, that <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> is not exceeded in its Number of Ships by any one of all the 33 Ports nam'd in the &s;aid En|rolment of the North Fleet. <HI>Yarmouth</HI> alone excepted. And how can it po&s;&s;ibly detract from the Glory of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to be then out-done by <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> when (which is very &s;urprizing) that &s;ame great <HI>Yar|mouth,</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> fitted out a va&s;tly greater Number both of Men and Ships, than <HI>London</HI> it&s;elf, the great Metropolis of the Kingdom, furni&s;h'd his Grace with for the memorable Siege of <HI>Calais,</HI> where he (I mean King <HI>Edward</HI> III.) and his Son the Black Prince acquir'd &s;uch Renown to the Engli&s;h, as will render them&s;elves and the Engli&s;h Nation famous to &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more I mu&s;t take Notice of before I conclude, which is, that the aforemention|ed Fleet Roll has no Date. I think it was about the Year 1347, when the Engli&s;h laid Siege to Calais, tho' I can't certainly tell, not having an Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory by me at pre&s;ent. This is all I can find upon a cur&s;ory View of the Book that has any Relation to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> begging Leave, in the mean Time, to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>The A&s;&s;i&s;es came to con&s;ider and know, if <HI>Peter Graper,</HI> Mayor, of the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne, John</HI> de <HI>Emeldon, Hugh</HI> de <HI>Angerton, Hugh</HI> de <HI>Carlel,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> de <HI>Acton</HI> Bailiffs of the &s;aid Town of <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> had unju&s;tly di&s;&s;ei&s;ed <HI>John</HI> Prior of <HI>Durham</HI> from his free Tenement in the &s;aid Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> after Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is enquired why they di&s;&s;ei&s;ed him from thirteen Marks and ten Shillings, the Rent with the Appurtenances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Peter</HI> and the others did not come; And the Sheriff declared, that the fore&s;aid <HI>Hugh</HI> de <HI>Angerton,</HI> and <HI>Hugh</HI> de <HI>Carlel</HI> are dead: And the fore&s;aid <HI>Peter</HI> is attached by <HI>Henry Gla&s;&s;en Wright,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging;</HI> and the fore&s;aid <HI>John</HI> de <HI>Emeldon</HI> by <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging</HI> and <HI>Thomas Stele;</HI> and the fore&s;aid <HI>Wiliam</HI> by <HI>Thomas</HI> de <HI>Newbigging</HI> and <HI>Henry Gla&s;&s;en Wright:</HI> Therefore they are in Mercy, and let the afore&s;aid A&s;&s;i&s;e be taken again&s;t them by Default, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And upon this the afore&s;aid Prior by his Attorney &s;ays, That our Lord the King now reigning, by his Charter, becau&s;e he heard from the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e whom he credits; That our Lord <HI>Edward,</HI> lately King of <HI>England,</HI> his Father, had in his Life, by Word of Mouth, granted to the Monks dwelling in the I&s;land of <HI>Farneland</HI> near <HI>Bamburgh,</HI> which I&s;land is a Cell of the Priory of <HI>Durham,</HI> ten Quarters of Corn and two Tuns of Wine, to be received every Year by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> as an Alms of his &s;aid Fa|ther for ever. And that this Grant was not duly put in Execution in the Life-time of his &s;aid Father, nor con|firmed by any of his Letters. Our pre&s;ent Lord the King for the Health of the Soul of his Father, being willing to fulfil and continue his Will in this Part, hath granted to the afore&s;aid Monks as a Compen&s;ation of the afore|&s;aid Corn and Wine, thirteen Marks and ten Shillings, to be received every year at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Michael</HI> by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of the &s;aid Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne</HI> then being, from the Fee of the &s;aid Town, namely, Five Marks for every Tun of Wine, and five Shillings for every Quarter of Corn, to be paid to the &s;aid Monks and their Succe&s;&s;ors dwelling in the fore&s;aid I&s;land as his Alms for ever; and he produces in Court the fore&s;aid Charter of our pre&s;ent Lord the King, which te&s;tifies this, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he prays A&s;&s;i&s;e: Let an A&s;&s;i&s;e therefore be taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By a Recognition of the afore&s;aid A&s;&s;i&s;e, they &s;ay upon their Oath, that the afore&s;aid Prior was &s;ei&s;ed of the fore&s;aid Rent with the Appurtenances, 'till the fore&s;aid <HI>Peter</HI> and others di&s;&s;ei&s;ed him, to the Lo&s;s of the &s;aid Prior forty one Pounds, thirteen Shillings and four Pence. It follows therefore that the afore&s;aid Prior may thence re|cover his Sei&s;ine again&s;t tho&s;e by a Sight of the Recognition of the A&s;&s;i&s;e afore&s;aid; and his Lo&s;&s;es afore&s;aid; and the &s;aid <HI>Peter</HI> and others are in the Injury. And let not the Sheriff be omitted becau&s;e of the Liberty of the afore|&s;aid Town becau&s;e that otherwi&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Original of Extempore Prayer, never to be forgotten, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Directory</HI> may boa&s;t of.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her excellent Mini&s;try endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h the Church of <HI>England</HI> upon the be&s;t Foundations, and &s;en&s;ible of the Attempts again&s;t her Liturgy, fir&s;t at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Franc|fort,</HI> and all rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions to convince the <HI>Puritans, Rome</HI> offers openly to abet that Separation, in a Way &s;o plau&s;ible, that had not Heaven detected the fir&s;t Agent, the <HI>Anabapti&s;m</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> mu&s;t have rooted in <HI>Eng|land</HI> under &s;o gifted a Teacher as <HI>Faithful Cummin,</HI> a noted <HI>Dominican,</HI> who&s;e Hi&s;tory I tran&s;cribe from <HI>Scrype</HI>'s Life of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Parker,</HI> pag. <HI>230</HI> and <HI>244.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In this Year came one of the&s;e Di&s;&s;enting Preachers, in Appearance (but in Truth a <HI>Dominican</HI> Friar) to <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> to the <HI>Maidenhead</HI> Inn there, with divers others his Followers; where, as Gue&s;ts, they be&s;pa e a Dinner: Divers others re&s;orted hither, enquiring for this Man, who&s;e Name was <HI>Faithful Cummin.</HI> The&s;e were his Congregation. Being thus met in the Room they had taken up, <HI>Cummin</HI> exerci&s;ed extemporary Prayer for about two Hours, groaning and weeping much. The Exerci&s;e being over, mo&s;t of the Company departed; &s;ome few carried and partook with the Exerci&s;er of the Dinner provided.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of this Meeting <HI>John Clark&s;on,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop's Chaplain, being informed, acquainted his Grace, and be the Queen and Council. Before whom at length this Man was convened the next Year, as a Sower of Sedition among the Queen's Subjects: Here the Archbi&s;hop examined him; he acknowledged he was ordained by Cardi|nal <HI>Pole,</HI> but &s;aid that he was fallen off from <HI>Rome,</HI> and that he was a Preacher of the Go&s;pel; but that he had no Licence to preach from any of the Bi&s;hops, &s;ince the Reformation. And when the Archbi&s;hop asked him, if he had no &s;uch Licence, how any could be a&s;&s;ured that he was not of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church? He would prove that by his Prayers and Sermons, wherein he had &s;poken again&s;t <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Pope,</HI> as much as any of the Clergy. And he pretented, that it was Licence enough to preach, to have the Spirit which he &s;aid he had. When the Archbi&s;hop again demanded, whether that could be the Spirit, that complied not with the Or|ders
<PB N="226" REF="237">
of the Church, lately purged and clean&s;ed from Idolatry? He replied, he endeavoured to make the Church purer than it was. This Man had a Congregation, that followed him; which he termed Men of tender Con|&s;ciences: And with them he prayed and preached, and admini&s;tred the Sacrament. When he preached in pub|lick, he would be ab&s;ent till the Divine Service were over (for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy he could not away with) and then he could come into the Church and preach.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After his former Examination, and giving Bail for his farther Appearance, he found Opportunity to e&s;cape beyond Sea; telling his Congregation, that he was warned of God to travel abroad, to in&s;truct Prote&s;tants in the other Parts of the World, and would come again to them: Leaving the&s;e as his la&s;t Words to them, That &s;piritual Prayer was the chief Te&s;timony of a true Prote&s;tant; and that the Set Form of Prayer was but the Ma&s;s tran&s;lated; and &s;o praying with them, and getting Money from them to bear his Expences, in many Tears he parted from them; and was afterwards &s;een in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and upon de|claring his Services to the Pope, who, after commending him, gave him a Reward of Two Thou&s;and Ducati.</Q> This is more amply related in the Fir&s;t Part of <HI>Foxes and Firebrands,</HI> pag. <HI>13.</HI></P>

<P>King <HI>James</HI> at his going into <HI>Scotland</HI> this Year, gave Directions for repairing and orderly adorning his Chapel, and Officers &s;ent out of <HI>England</HI> with Nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;ome Portraits and Pictures of the Apo&s;tles carved for the Pews and Stalls; but the People exclaim at the Sights, that &s;uch Images were to be &s;et up; the Organs were come before, and after comes the Ma&s;s. The King was angry at their Ignorance, and &s;ent them word to di&s;tingui&s;h be|twixt Pictures intended for Ornament and Decoration, and Images erected for Wor&s;hip and Adoration.

<ITEM><HI>Robert Elli&s;on</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>On the 15th of <HI>January,</HI> this year, in a di&s;mal &s;nowy Sea&s;on, the <HI>Scots,</HI> contrary to all Faith and Loyalty, pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Berwick,</HI> ac|company'd by a &s;elect Committee of their own, and there met another from <HI>England,</HI> who were to conduct and &s;upply them in the mo&s;t loving Manner: Upon their Conjunction, was framed the General Committee of both Kingdoms, and in Effect became a united Camp-Parliament. Before the Advance of the Army by a Trumpeter, they &s;ent a Letter to Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Commanders and Gentlemen of <HI>Northumber|land,</HI> at <HI>Alnwick;</HI> in which they in&s;i&s;ted upon the Solemn League and Covenant, and declared their well-weighed Re&s;olutions, to prevent that imminent Danger, not only of Corruption, but of Ruin, which they &s;aw evidently in|tended to the true Prote&s;tant Religion, by the Popi&s;h and Prelatical Faction; and to re&s;cue his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Honour from the Coun&s;els of tho&s;e, who&s;e Ends are little better than Popery and Tyranny. Therefore, they expected the Concurrence of them, and all others; and if they met with any Oppo&s;ition, the Law of Nature, and their own Rea&s;on, would tell them what they are to expect. With this Letter they &s;ent al&s;o a Copy of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Declaration, to give it the greater Force and Authority among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>The brave Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham,</HI> after a &s;erious Con&s;ultation with the Officers and Gentry, how mo&s;t to in|commode the Enemy's March, returned a &s;harp An&s;wer; in which he and the re&s;t declare. That, without the Sight of that Letter, they could not have believed that the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation, or the pre&s;ent prevailing Party in that Nation, would have attempted an Inva&s;ion of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o contrary to the Laws of God, of Nations, and of both Kingdoms, but e&s;pecially to the late Act of Pacification; &s;o oppo&s;ite to their Allegiance and Gratitude to his Ma|je&s;ty, to that neighbourly Love they pretend, to that di&s;creet Care they &s;hould have of their own Safety. They declare, that no Order of Committees what&s;oever, of Men, or Angels, could give Power to make War again&s;t their natural Sovereign, upon the empty Pretence of namele&s;s evil Coun&s;ellors; and for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Agents, they could not believe them any Commi&s;&s;ioners lawfully authorized by the Two Hou&s;es of Parliament, or yet by the Hou&s;e of Commons, whence &s;o many Members were expell'd by partial Voting, &s;o many bani&s;hed by &s;editious Tumults, &s;o many voluntarily ab&s;ent out of Con&s;cience; where De&s;peration, Want of Opportunity to depart, or Fear of certain Plunder, were the chief Bonds which held the little Remnant together from Di&s;&s;ipation , where the venerable Name of <HI>Parliament</HI> was made a State to countenance the pernicious Coun&s;els and Acts of a clo&s;e Committee.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Scots,</HI> they declare, that no Covenant what&s;oever could ju&s;tify &s;uch Proceedings, begun without any Nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;o much as Provocation. After an&s;wering their Preten&s;ions, they de&s;ire them to con&s;ider, that there mu&s;t be an Account given to God of all the Blood which &s;hould be &s;hed in this Quarrel: And &s;ince their In&s;ults
<PB N="233" REF="244">
were &s;uch, that a vanqui&s;hed Nation could &s;carce endure, from their Conquerors, they could not think they were grown &s;o &s;ame, as to de&s;ert ther Religion, Laws, Liberties, and E&s;tates, upon Command of Foreigners; and to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be made Beggars, and Slaves, without Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The&s;e Paper-Skirmi&s;hes had no other Effect, than to gain &s;ome little Time for Sir <HI>Thomas Glenham</HI> to draw his Forces and Artillery to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> for <HI>Alnwick</HI> was not tenable; be&s;ides, he found &s;everal of the Gentlemen of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;uch as were allied to the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wark,</HI> either for fear of the <HI>Scotch,</HI> or Affection to their Cau&s;e, were very backward in oppo&s;ing the Enemy. The <HI>Scotch</HI> marched after him by &s;low and difficult Marches, by Rea&s;on of the Snow and Floods, and on the 3d of <HI>February</HI> &s;ummoned the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> but finding they were not able to take the Place, after three Weeks Stay, and &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes, they pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Tyne</HI> on the 28th of <HI>February,</HI> and on the 4th of <HI>March</HI> entred <HI>Sunderland.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> Ge|neral for the King in the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Parts, having reinforced his Army to about <HI>14,000</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot, attended &s;o near the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, and &s;o intercepted their Supplies, that &s;ometimes they had neither Meat nor Drink, and were never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of above twenty-four Hours Provi&s;ion; but they coloured over their nece&s;&s;ity by keeping a &s;o|lemn Fa&s;t; and pre&s;&s;ing on towards <HI>Durham</HI> for better Quarters, to &s;top their advancing, on the Twenty-third of <HI>March</HI> the Marquis drew up his Army at <HI>Hilton,</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> of the River <HI>Were;</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> were drawn up on <HI>Whitburn Lizard,</HI> a Hill <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> from them, adjoining to the Sea: So the Armies faced each other, and skir|mi&s;hed in Parties; the Field-Word given by the Marquis being prophetically enough, <HI>Now or Never;</HI> and by the <HI>Scots,</HI> in their a&s;&s;uming Way, <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts is with us.</HI> The Marquis not being able to force the <HI>Scots</HI> to a Battle, retreated towards his Quarters at <HI>Durham,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> followed &s;lowly, but could make no con&s;ide|rable Advance, till the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Parliament Forces, by a new Diver&s;ion, gave them Op|portunity to de&s;cend into <HI>York&s;hire. Echard.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Year, after the City of <HI>York</HI> had &s;urrender'd to the Parliament, the three Armies thought &s;it to &s;eparate; the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Army was order'd to march <HI>Northwards,</HI> and joining with the Earl of <HI>Calander,</HI> who had enter'd <HI>England</HI> with <HI>10,000 Scots,</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> on the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> the Siege la&s;ted above two Months, and proved one of the mo&s;t re&s;olute in the Kingdom; all Sorts of Policy of Peace and War; by Treaty, by Mines, by A&s;&s;aults, having been u&s;ed to little Effect, the Inhabitants re&s;olving (if po&s;&s;ible) never to fall into the Hands of the <HI>Scots.</HI> But on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 19th of <HI>October</HI> the whole <HI>Scotch</HI> Army furiou&s;ly &s;et upon the Town, and having made three Breaches, after a tedious and bloody Storm, they at la&s;t ma&s;ter'd it. Sir <HI>John Marley,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Cole,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Barker,</HI> got into the Ca&s;tle, where being forced by Nece&s;&s;ity, they came to a Capitulation, and &s;urrender'd on the 27th of the &s;ame Month. The Town being taken by A&s;&s;ault, was &s;ufficiently plunder'd; but the Surrendry proved of great Importance to the City of <HI>London,</HI> where the poorer Sort of People, for the two la&s;t Years, were almo&s;t &s;tarved for want of Fewel, Coals having been ri&s;en to the Price of <HI>4 l.</HI> a Chaldron; a Price never known before that Time. <HI>Echard.</HI></P>
<P>In this Year the round Tower under the <HI>Moot-Hall,</HI> towards the <HI>Sand-Hill,</HI> called the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> which was the old Ca&s;tle of <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> was by Sir <HI>John Marley</HI> made u&s;e of to &s;ecure the River and Key-&s;ide again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the other Ca&s;tle he put into good Repair, which was very ruinous: On the former he laid great Guns, for the U&s;e above-mentioned; and on the latter he laid great Ordnance, to beat off tho&s;e Guns which the <HI>Scots</HI> had laid upon the Banks of <HI>Gate&s;head</HI> again&s;t the Town. And this he managed bravely for a long time; for the <HI>Scots</HI> began the siege about <HI>July,</HI> and it was the 19th of <HI>October</HI> before they could take it; which they did by Storm, upon the Day after St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Day; and it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the <HI>White Fryer Tower</HI> and <HI>Sand|gate,</HI> where the Colliers of <HI>El&s;wick</HI> and <HI>Benwell</HI> were employed under one <HI>John Osbourn</HI> (a fal&s;e rebellious <HI>Scot</HI>) to undermine the Walls; which they did, and blew them up, and &s;o got and plunder'd the Town. And no marvel, for they were accounted <HI>30,000</HI> Men, and the Town&s;men were but, in all, <HI>1500</HI> Men, wearied with continual Watch and Duty, tho' Men of great Courage, and &s;ought it gallantly to the la&s;t; for the <HI>Newgate</HI> Ward, which was under Capt. <HI>Cuthbert Carr,</HI> was taken by the Enemy, who entered at the a&s;ore&s;aid Places, and en|compa&s;&s;ed them before and behind; and <HI>Pilgrim-&s;treet</HI> Gate was maintained by Capt. <HI>George Errington,</HI> Lieu|tenant <HI>William Rob&s;on,</HI> and En&s;ign <HI>Thomas Swan,</HI> who &s;ought and killed very many, they them&s;elves not having one hurt, until they were encompa&s;&s;ed by the Enemy before and behind: And even then they would not parley with the <HI>Scots</HI> who fought again&s;t them without, but did capitulate with Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Sinclair,</HI> who loved and honoured them, and kept his Agreement &s;o well with them, that not one of them was robbed of his Cloaths or Money, nor were any of his Men &s;uffered to give any evil Word; and it was the great Ble&s;&s;ing of God, that, in all that Time, there was not one Man &s;lain, nor hurt, altho' that Company con&s;i&s;ted of Nine&s;core Men, all Trade&s;Men, and there were divers Sallies made out at that Gate; for it was the longe&s;t of all the Gates of the Town, it being barrocaded and &s;hut up. And after they had &s;urrender'd, and the Enemy was called over at that Breach, they dur&s;t not approach, but &s;hot at their Friends that called them, and would not believe that the Town was taken.

<HEAD>The <HI>COMMITTEE</HI>'S <HI>DECLARATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Committees of both Kingdoms, after many Meetings and &s;erious Debates among&s;t them&s;elves, and the hearing of &s;undry Per&s;ons well experienced in the Collieries and Coal-Works about the Town of</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>and having taken into their &s;erious Con&s;ideration &s;undry Propo&s;itions for the Good of tho&s;e Works, and the driving on of that Trade for the Benefit of the Parliament, and the Pay of the Army, have at length concluded and agreed among&s;t them&s;elves, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious Delinquents and Ma|lignants, late Coal-Owners in the Town of</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>&s;hould be wholly excluded from intermeddling with any Shares or Parts of Collieries, or Intere&s;t in any Coals what&s;omever, that formerly they have laid Claim unto, and that the re&s;t of the &s;aid Delinquents de&s;erve not to have any Benefit of the &s;aid Coals or Col|lieries: But in regard the Delinquents and Malignants belonging to tho&s;e Collieries were very many in Number, they did not conceive it for the Service of the Parliament, or the Army, to put them all out at once, and &s;o to hazard the retarding of the pre&s;ent &s;etting on of the Works, and ruining of the &s;ame, in regard they were furni&s;hed with Materials and Uten&s;ils, and had Things ready at hand, and did be&s;t know where to find Workmen, which Strangers would have had Difficulty to find, and could not po&s;&s;ibly on the &s;udden &s;ufficiently provide them&s;elves to &s;et on the Works; and having made Trial to lett &s;ome Delin|quents Collieries, and, for this Purpo&s;e, having treated with &s;ome well-affected Per&s;ons what Profit might be rai&s;ed, and how they might be lett for the mo&s;t Benefit to the Parliament, were con&s;train'd for the pre&s;ent rather to make U&s;e of tho&s;e Delinquents in working their own Collieries as Tenants and Servants to the Parliament, than to engage our Friends upon Incertainties, and hazard their Lo&s;s, as our own Hindrance in &s;etting forward the Works, for the U&s;e and Benefit of the Parliament. Wherefore the Com|mittees of both Kingdoms, &s;eeing the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;patching away the Ships that every Day call upon us for their Lading, and lie at Charges in Expectation of getting Coals for their Money, have thought fit to make the following Declaration to all, but &s;uch as are expected as before-mentioned, and who&s;e Names are hereafter written.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> That for the pre&s;ent Time there be allowed, on the behalf of the re&s;t of the late Coal-Owners, <HI>10 s.</HI> Sterling upon every Chaldron of Ship-Coals, for de&s;raying the Charges in the Works under-ground, Carri|age thereof to the Staiths, and from thence in Keels to the Ships, paying the Town-Dues, as was formerly paid <HI>(viz.) 3 d.</HI> for the Town, and <HI>3 d.</HI> for the Garri&s;on <HI>per</HI> Chalder, and the u&s;ual and accu&s;tomed Rents for the Pits; and as a competent Con&s;ideration for the Support of the &s;aid late Owners them&s;elves, and this Allowance is made, as well for the Coals at the Staiths and Pits ready wrought, as tho&s;e to be wrought, the &s;aid Owners, Collieries and Workmen, being always obliged to &s;et on Foot with all Dili|gence, and maintain their Coal-Works, make ready their Keels, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries &s;it for the &s;ame; and the Coal-Workers who are to receive the Benefit of Payment, as above&s;aid, for their Work out of the Coals already above ground, are obliged to continue in working the &s;aid Coals at the ordinary Rate and Conditions, as was formerly accu&s;tomed, And what&s;oover more Price the &s;aid Chalders of Coals (being &s;old to Merchant&s; or Ma&s;ters of &s;hips) &s;hall yield above the &s;aid <HI>10 s. per</HI> Chalder, together with what Cu&s;tom and impo&s;t is or &s;hall be put upon the &s;ame; and the old Cu&s;tom of <HI>1 s.</HI> upon the Chalder for|merly paid by the Owners to his Maje&s;ty, to be employed for the Pay and Maintenance of the Army, upon Account, to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> or their Committes.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> That the Coal&s; already wrought above-ground, either at Pits or Staiths, Belonging to Friends, have like Allowance of <HI>10 s.</HI> upon the Chalder, they paying the &s;aid Town's Duties <HI>(viz.) 3 d.</HI> to the Town,
<PB N="235" REF="246">
and <HI>3 d.</HI> to the Garri&s;on <HI>per</HI> Chalder.

<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> It is thought fit that the Price of Coals be <HI>15 s. per</HI> Chalder, with the A&s;&s;e&s;s of <HI>4 s.</HI> upon the Chal|der, and the ancient <HI>12 d,</HI> to the King, is <HI>20 s.</HI> for every Chalder to Merchant or Skipper, for all Coals vended in this Port of <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> and for tho&s;e exported, to pay the &s;ame Rate, and &s;uch further Cu&s;|tom as is ordained by the Book of Cu&s;tom-Rates.</P>

<CELL><HI>Henry Rawling.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>In this year, when King <HI>Charles I.</HI> by his ill Succe&s;s, was reduced to the lowe&s;t Ebb, he, upon &s;ome A&s;&s;urances of Protection from the <HI>Scots,</HI> then be&s;ieging <HI>Newark,</HI> repaired to their Army, and immediately gave Orders to the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> to &s;ur|render <HI>Newark,</HI> which might have held out &s;everal Months longer; which done, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, before they could have received any Orders from the Parliament, with uncommon Expedition, marched with him to <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> where they arrived May the <HI>13th.</HI> About the Middle of <HI>July</HI> the Parliament &s;ent their Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> of the Peers, and Sir <HI>Walter Earl,</HI> Sir <HI>John Hippi&s;ley, Robert Goodwin,</HI> and <HI>Luke Robin&s;on,</HI> E&s;qrs. for the Commons, with <HI>10</HI> Propo&s;itions for his Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;ent to, [<HI>See</HI> Ru&s;hworth.] Demands of &s;uch a horrid and de&s;tructive Nature, as would, if granted, have render'd the King and his Me|mory inglorious and de&s;picable both at home and abroad. The King perceiving all Things tending to his Ruin, he &s;eemed to hearken mo&s;t to his old fal&s;e Friend <HI>William Murray</HI> of the Bed-Chamber, who privately propo&s;ed an E&s;cape, and offered to make his Way, and to have a &s;hip in Readine&s;s to tran&s;port his Maje&s;ty beyond Sea. The Project appeared plau&s;ible, and the King had di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf for it, but was di&s;covered in the Attempt. Whether he was faithful to his Maje&s;ty in this Point, is uncertain, &s;ince Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> was concerned in it; but Bi&s;hop <HI>Guthry</HI> &s;ays it was divulged before the &s;et Time, &s;o that there was no Di&s;cour&s;e throughout the Army but of <HI>Murray</HI>'s Plot to carry away the King. Thereupon a Guard of Soldiers was immediately planted at his Cham|ber, Door, both within and without; by which his Maje&s;ty was not only deprived of Liberty, but al&s;o of Quiet and Retirement; and having an Antipathy again&s;t Tobacco, was much di&s;turbed by their bold and continual &s;moaking in his Pre&s;ence: A military Pre&s;age of the &s;ame heatheni&s;h Barbarity at going to the Block before <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his Maje&s;ty's Entry into <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> he was care&s;&s;ed with Bonfires and Ringing of Bells, Drums and Trumpets, and Peals of Ordnance; but guarded by <HI>300</HI> of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, the&s;e near him bare-headed. He lodged at General <HI>Levin</HI>'s Quarters, who proclaims that Papi&s;ts or Delinquents &s;hould not come near his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And that altho' his Maje&s;ty was pre&s;ent, yet all Men what&s;oever &s;hould yield Obedience to the Ordinance of Parliament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Army are now, they imagine, Ma&s;ters of all, by their Power of the King's Per&s;on, and levy into|lerable Taxes and A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments upon all <HI>Northern</HI> Counties, which very cour&s;ely re&s;ent them, and complain to the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ters,</HI> not without &s;ome Ri&s;ing of the People &s;tanding upon their Guard: And all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Hor&s; formerly &s;ent into <HI>Scotland</HI> are return'd into <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> which makes the Hou&s;e of Common debate and vote, That this Kingdom had no further Need of the Army of our Brethren the <HI>Scots</HI> in this Kingdom, and that the Sum of <HI>100,000 l.</HI> &s;hould be advanced and paid to that Army as followeth, <HI>viz, 50,000 l.</HI> thereof after their &s;urrendring of <HI>Newca&s;tle, Carli&s;le,</HI> and other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them in <HI>England,</HI> and the other <HI>50,000 l.</HI> after they are advanced into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Order &s;hall be taken for Payment of their Arrears.</P>
<P>And forthwith Mr. <HI>Alexander Hender&s;on,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Apo&s;tolick: Mini&s;ter, and one of their Commi&s;&s;ioners, was &s;ent from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to di&s;pute with the King, and to convince him to the Covenant; where, after several Di&s;cour&s;e and Meetings, the King is plea&s;ed to de&s;cend so low as to argue Rea&s;ons by Wri|tings, which continued &s;everal Encounters by Papers till the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> concerning Church-Matters, by Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rity of the Fathers, and Practice of the Church, which <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> would avoid, by Texts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and from thence, his own Opinion &s;hould guide him beyond all univer&s;al Con&s;ent or Practice of the Primitive Church which were erroneous, which was not contradicted by orthodox learned Men in the Times of the fir&s;t Practice, as is easily percieved: That the&s;e De&s;ections were, &s;ome of them ju&s;tly called Rebellions, which <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> mentions. And la&s;tly, that alleit he never e&s;teem'd any Authority equal to the Scripture, yet he thanks the numerous Con|&s;ent of the Fathers, and the univer&s;al Practice of the Primitive Church, to be the be&s;t and Authentical Inter|preters of God's Word, and consequently the pure&s;t Judges between him and <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> until better may be &s;ound;

<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> now in &s;ome Jealou&s;y how mightily the King complies with his Parliament, and that they &s;hould not be able, perhaps, to effect their De&s;igns by Force, endeavour it by Fraud and Cunning, by in&s;inuating to the Parliament, that their Con&s;cience bears them Witne&s;s, of their con&s;tant Endeavours to pre&s;erve the Union of both Kingdoms; yet never more than &s;ince the King's coming to their Army, by effecting &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages from his Ma|je&s;ty as might be a &s;ure Ground of Peace to his People, and Happine&s;s to him&s;elf. And although we have not as yet prevailed over his Principles, deeply rooted in him, as to obtain the utmo&s;t of our De&s;ires, which we hope in a &s;hort Time to effect; and we hope that accordingly the Parliament will be plea&s;ed to &s;end their Propo&s;itions of Peace to him, upon who&s;e An&s;wer we &s;hall clearly know how to proceed in the intendedPacification, and to &s;atisfy the Parliament in disbanding our Armies, delivering up the Garri&s;ons Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by us, and retiring home for the Good of both Kingdoms.</P>

<P>THE Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of this Town, did mo&s;t freely and unanimou&s;ly joyne in a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, for &s;peedy and impartial Ju&s;tice upon the great Incendiaries be|twixt the&s;e two Kingdoms, and the chief Promoters of this Election, who have already confe&s;s'd them|&s;elves guilty of all the Blood which hath been &s;hed by this unnatural Warr, who have been twice con|quered by Us, and this we ground upon our <HI>Solemn League and Covenant,</HI> to which we have always ad|hered, and by which all Delinquents ought to be brought to condign Puni&s;hment, without Exception; though our Treaties have, upon what Grounds wee know not, nor are not yet &s;atisfyed, admitted of a Per&s;onal Treaty with the Cheife of Them, as if, after twice conquered, he or his Party was &s;en&s;ible there|of, and of whom, as wee yet hear of, any Conviction of Con&s;cience or Judgment, but only for an Op|portunity to cut the Throats of Us and all others, that have ingaged again&s;t them in this Nation; and be|ing &s;o unhappy that wee could not by any Means obtain their Judgment thereof, or Intentions thereupon, it hath added many &s;ad Fears and Thoughts to our former Perplexities, and even a&s;ton&s;hed Us to con&s;i|der how our Bondage and Ruine is by this Treaty, &s;ince our Petition, &s;o ju&s;t, rational, and in Pro&s;ecution of our Covenant, and their own Proceedings, &s;hould appear unworthy of the lea&s;t Re&s;pects or Con&s;ide|ration; and therefore. Wee mu&s;t &s;till endeavour to keep our fir&s;t Integrity without Spott and Blemi&s;h, for if wee would never bow the Knee to <HI>Baal</HI> at the King's Command, wee will never do it at the Par|liament's; and if they act again&s;t the Truth repo&s;ed in them by the People, the People are bound in Con|&s;cience and Duty to act again&s;t them, <HI>Salus Populi</HI> being <HI>Suprema Lex.</HI> The Lord direct Us for his Glory, and the Good of the poor Commons of <HI>England,</HI> who are like to be bought and &s;old, becau&s;e they are ignorant of their own Freedom and Birth-right, which they are willing to &s;ell for a Mea&s;e of Pottage, &s;o they may injoy a &s;lavi&s;h Peace, though it hath co&s;t much precious Blood in the Time of their Pro&s;ecution of this unnatural War for the Pre&s;ervation of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Reverend and Honoured</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did purpo&s;ely delay my An&s;wer to your la&s;t of the 22d pa&s;t, till at my la&s;t Vi&s;itation I had enquired after, and examined the Reparation of the Chappel of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> within the Vicarage of <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> the Re&s;ult whereof is, 1. The &s;aid Chappel is not a Chappel of Ea&s;e, but a Parochial Chappel, which the Mo|ther-Church is not bound to repair, but belongs to them&s;elves: You know very well the Epi&s;copal Sentence at the Dedication of &s;uch Chappels, the Body whereof lies upon the Pari&s;hioners of the Chappel, and the Chancel upon the Impropriators or Appropriators. 2. That by Order of Mr. <HI>George Willoughby,</HI> Tenant to the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> for his Part of the Tythes, Mr. <HI>Carr</HI> Alderman of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> his Sub-Tenant, hath configned 10. <HI>l.</HI> about the 8th In&s;tant into the Hands of Capt. <HI>Fenwick</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Mu&s;grave</HI> Cu|rate of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> for the Repair of the &s;ame; and I am confident the Dean and Chapter will be as forward to follow that Example. 3. You were mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nformed concerning the Obligation of the poor Vicar of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> to repair the Chappel, upon a Suppo&s;ition that the Benefit of the Mortuaries, and of the Burials there, belongs to him, which you &s;ay are 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for each Burial, whereof the Vicar receives but 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> but the Burthen of repairing the Chappels would, 'tis &s;iad, &s;urcharge the Vicarage in Value thrice over.</P>
<P>Having no more to trouble you withal at this Time, but to commend my &s;elf to your good Prayers, I remain,</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>CASE</HI> touching the Chancel of the Church of <HI>South Gosforth,</HI> and &s;ome Proceedings concerning the &s;ame, truly Stated.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is clear Law, that when no Per&s;on or Per&s;ons appear who are liable to the Repair of either Church or Chancol; that in &s;uch Ca&s;e the Tythes or other Profits within that Pari&s;h are to be &s;eque&s;ter'd for the &s;aid Repaire, after Notice given to the Parties concerned in &s;uch Profits. <HI>Con&s;titut.

<P><HI>De Facto,</HI> Notice was frequently given to the Lord Bi&s;hop and Dean and Chapter of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who are Impropriators of the Tythan within the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gosforth,</HI> and to their Farmers likewi&s;e, who &s;hould have appeared and &s;howed &s;omething in Di&s;charge of the <HI>Onus Reparandi;</HI> for <HI>Gosforth</HI> Church is neither Chap|pel of Ea&s;e, non-Parochial Chappel within the Rectory of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> as the Ca&s;e was mi&s;tated to Dr. <HI>Exton;</HI> 1. Becau&s;e <HI>Gosforth</HI> is reputed and taken to be a Church and Pari&s;h di&s;tinct 2. The Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is no Rectory, but a Vicarage; and in Ca&s;t two Churches Parochial be united, as probably the&s;e may be, the Reparation &s;hall be &s;everall as before, <HI>Hob.</HI> 67. 3. The Ca&s;e was mi&s;tated to Dr. <HI>Exton</HI> in a ma|terial and e&s;&s;ential Part thereof, being put, of an Impropriator who repairs a Mother-Church; for, fir&s;t, <HI>non Con&s;ent,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Gosforth</HI> Church that St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is the Mother-Church, but rather the contrary, as above. Secondly; it is notorious that the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and Chapter of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> have refu&s;ed to repair the Chancel of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and particularly to allow the late Dean's Accounts, who <HI>de facto</HI> once repaired it; &s;o that the Ca&s;e put to Dr. <HI>Exton</HI> differing e&s;&s;entially from this, his Opinion, which is allowed to be good Law, cannot reach this.</P>
<P>The Impropriators of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gosforth</HI> may be &s;oon &s;atisfied, tho' it was once denied them, from the Authorities formerly &s;ent, that Impropriators, as well as the Par&s;on <HI>de Communi Jure,</HI> ought to repair the Chancel, unle&s;s they can prove contrary by Cu&s;tom or Compo&s;ition.</P>

<P>UPON reading of your Paper which you &s;ent inclo&s;ed to my Lord our Bi&s;hop, touching the Repairs of <HI>Gosforth</HI> Chappel, I pre&s;ently ob&s;erved that the Authorities therein quoted are indeed very clear and full, as to the repairing of the Mother-Church, but reach not at all to Chappels, the Burthen whereof I have always been told did lie wholly upon the Inhabitants within each &s;uch Chapplery, the Par&s;on or Impropriators being no Way liable thereunto. However, for my better Satisfaction, I wrote to a Friend of mine in <HI>London,</HI> and reque&s;ted him to con&s;ult &s;ome able Civilian about it, and &s;end me down his Opi|nion. The Quaere which I &s;ent up was expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e very Words:</P>
<P><Q>Whether an Impropriator be obliged, of common Right, to repair and uphold the Chancels, not only of the Mother-Church, but of all the Chappels likewi&s;e within the Rectory; and whether the Di|&s;tinction of Chappels Parochial and Chappels of Ea&s;e make any Difference in the Ca&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>The Per&s;on con&s;ulted was Dr. <HI>Exton,</HI> Chancellor to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Opinion, under his own Hand, I here &s;end you inclo&s;ed, hoping it will give you Satisfaction; or if not, that you will plea&s;e to let me know, that &s;o we may con&s;ider what is further to be done.</P>
<P>With my true Re&s;pects and Service to your &s;elf and your Lady, craving the Continuance of your good Prayers, I remain ever,</P>

<HEAD>Dr. <HI>EXTON</HI>'S Opinion, mention'd above.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE Law is certain, that where there is a Mother-Church and a Chappel of Ea&s;e, or a Parochial Chappel, which makes no Difference, if the Mother-Church be out of Repair, tho&s;e Inhabitants within the Chappelries &s;hall contribute towards the Repair of that Church: But <HI>e contra</HI> neither the Im|propriator nor Pari&s;hioners of the Mother-Church &s;hall at all contribute towards the Repairs of tho&s;e Chappels: Except either they have done it, and &s;o &s;uffer'd a Cu&s;tom to grow upon them, or there be &s;ome Re&s;ervation &s;o to do it in the Foundation of tho&s;e Chappels.
