<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN an author pretends to write a treati&s;e on any particular &s;ubject, he ought to have lei&s;ure &s;ufficient to examine and thoroughly con&s;ider every thing that has an intimate connex|ion with it; but, as the Writer of this has no &s;uch lei&s;ure, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him to declare that he profe&s;&s;es no other knowledge of the &s;ubject, in que&s;tion, than what has occurred to him occa|&s;ionally in con&s;ulting the law-books on other points; and, there|fore,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
he offers this little Tract to his readers, not as a complete and regular &s;y&s;tem, but rather as a ground-work for future enqui|ries upon the &s;ubject, by Writers who are ble&s;&s;ed with more lei&s;ure and abilities for &s;uch re&s;earches than him&s;elf; and who may, perhaps, be hereby induced either to build upon the &s;ame founda|tion, or to e&s;tabli&s;h a better in its room.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT TRACT CONCERNING THE Doctrine of <Q>Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of <Q>Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi,</Q> if admitted in an unlimited and general &s;en&s;e, is capable of being wre&s;ted to the mo&s;t arbitrary purpo&s;es, and may &s;eem to au|thorize the mo&s;t dangerous and oppre&s;|&s;ive preten&s;ions and claims on the pro|perty of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As <HI>a general doctrine,</HI> therefore, it is <HI>unrea&s;onable;</HI> and, con&s;equently, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental principles
<PB N="2" REF="9">
of the <HI>common law;</HI> for which rea&s;on I never could e&s;teem the <HI>Nullum Tempus</HI> doctrine as <HI>a maxim</HI> of the common law; and I have &s;ince found that my opinion of it was in &s;ome degree right, and that the doctrine is &s;o far from being <HI>a general maxim,</HI> that it ought never to be menti|oned without its peculiar <HI>exceptions,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould do injury, by being applied to improper ca&s;es, and be mi&s;taken for <HI>a maxim,</HI> to the perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice: for the true and proper <HI>maxims</HI> of the com|mon law demand the utmo&s;t deference when they are cited, their authority be|ing unque&s;tionable; becau&s;e <Q>Contra negantem principia <HI>(vel maxima)</HI> non e&s;t di&s;putandum.</Q> (Co. Lit. 343. Doc|tor &amp; Student, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> c. 8. p. 27.)</P>
<P>This maxim may indeed &s;eem appli|cable to my&s;elf, for denying that the authority and weight of <HI>a maxim</HI> is due to the doctrine of <HI>Nullum Tempus, &amp;c.</HI> But I hope to be able, in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
this work, to obviate any &s;uch imputa|tion, and to prove <HI>that it really is not a general maxim.</HI> In order to &s;et this point in a clear light, it will be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to take a &s;hort view of tho&s;e par|ticular <HI>rights of the crown,</HI> which, <HI>in law,</HI> are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed <HI>unalienable,</HI> and which I apprehend to be as follows.</P>
<P>The king is inve&s;ted, by his office, with a kind of <HI>limited property</HI> in the per|&s;ons of all his <HI>free &s;ubjects,</HI> by which he is enabled, and, indeed, bound in duty to claim, and <HI>free</HI> them whenever their per&s;ons are unlawfully &s;eized, impri&s;on|ed, or otherwi&s;e detained at home or a|broad, under pretence of right of &s;er|vice, whereby their <HI>per&s;ons</HI> are claimed as <HI>private property,</HI> acquired by purcha&s;e, cu&s;tom, or any other mode of acqui&s;i|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Query. How far may this hold good &s;ince the ma|king of the Habeas Corpus act, which &s;uppo&s;es that a man may be tran&s;ported again&s;t his will if he has &s;ign|ed a written contract? Sect. 13. This &s;ection, howe|ver, gives no authority for &s;uch a forcible tran&s;porta|tion; it only informs us, that the act does NOT <HI>"extend to give benefit" in &s;uch ca&s;e;</HI> but the common law, we may pre&s;ume, will or ought to <HI>"give benefit"</HI> in this, as in every other ca&s;e, of <HI>violence</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>"Lex &s;emper dabit remedium:"</HI> and I have al|ready &s;hewn that the right of the Crown is <HI>unalienable</HI> in this kind <HI>of property,</HI> for the maintainance of <HI>freedom.</HI></NOTE> what&s;oever. For no claims of this
<PB N="4" REF="11">
kind, upon a <HI>freeman,</HI> are to be favour|ed in law, or can po&s;&s;ibly be accounted valid, becau&s;e the maxim a&s;&s;ures us that <HI>"Liber homo"</HI> is <HI>"res qua&s;i &s;acra," "which may not be &s;old:"</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Item qua&s;i res &s;acra ut <HI>liber homo</HI> qui vendi non pote&s;t, c&ugrave;m <HI>libertas</HI> non recipiat ae&s;timationem,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Bracton, lib. 2, p. 14.</NOTE> &s;o that there can be no ju&s;t claim of property <HI>in the per&s;on of a freeman,</HI> except the <HI>official right</HI> and <HI>claim of property</HI> ve&s;ted in the king; and, as this is <HI>limited</HI> by the laws for the benefit and <HI>freedom of the &s;ubject,</HI> it is, for that very rea&s;on, <HI>unalienable from the crown.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">Other <HI>unalienable rights of the Crown</HI> are tho&s;e which form the public revenue, and belong to the king's exchequer, all which are included by this author in the term <HI>"Res fi&s;calis,"</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Et e&s;t res qua&s;i &s;acra, <HI>Res fi&s;calis,</HI> quae dari non pote&s;t, nec vendi, nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a rege regnante&mdash;</Q></NOTE> and which he al&s;o e&s;teems <HI>"res qua&s;i &s;acra."</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">To this rule, about <HI>Res fi&s;calis,</HI> there are &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary exceptions which will hereafter be mentioned.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal other rights, which are inherent in the Crown, <HI>for the public good,</HI> and cannot therefore be di&s;|po&s;ed of, or alienated, viz. &s;uch as <HI>Peace, Ju&s;tice,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; <Q>et quae faciunt ip&s;am coronam, et communem utilitatem re|&s;piciunt, &s;icut e&s;t <HI>Pax</HI> et <HI>Ju&s;titia,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>To all &s;uch things we may &s;afely apply the doctrine of <Q>Nullum tempus occurrit regi.</Q>&mdash; The &s;ame is likewi&s;e applica|ble to a few other things, even of an inferior or &s;econd cla&s;s; I mean &s;uch as
<PB N="6" REF="13">
are neverthele&s;s &s;o far <HI>alienable,</HI> that they may lawfully, without damage to the king or his &s;ubjects, be transferred, <HI>for a time,</HI> to other per&s;ons. &mdash; <Q>Sunt et aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam propter privile|gium regis, et ita communem non re|&s;piciunt utilitatem, quin dari po&s;&s;unt et ad alium transferri, quia, &s;i transfe|rantur, tran&s;latio nulli erit damno&s;a, nec ip&s;i regi &s;ive principi, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;The things, ranked in this cla&s;s of <HI>Royal Pro|perty,</HI> are, <HI>&s;ea-wrecks, trea&s;ures found, great fi&s;h,</HI> as <HI>whales, &s;turgeons,</HI> and other <HI>royal fi&s;h.</HI> And who&s;oever pretends to have a right to enjoy the profits ari&s;ing from the&s;e particular things, mu&s;t be a|ble to produce a &s;pecial <HI>warrant</HI> for that purpo&s;e; becau&s;e <HI>pre&s;cription,</HI> even of a very long time, is not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the preten&s;ion: <Q>Diuturnitas enim tem|poris, <HI>in hoc ca&s;u,</HI> injuriam <HI>non minuit, &s;ed auget, nec in primo ca&s;u,</HI> NEC IN ISTO, CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA REGEM,
<PB N="7" REF="14">
nec incumbit ei probatio quia ad ip|&s;um pertineant, cum con&s;tare debeat &s;ingulis, quod huju&s;modi de jure gen|tium pertineant ad coronam.</Q></P>
<P>But, with re&s;pect to things of a third cla&s;s, as <HI>crown-manors, lands, tenements,</HI> &amp;c. the ca&s;e is widely different, for the doctrine of <HI>Nullum tempus,</HI> &amp;c. affects them not at all! And I am a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;o many gentlemen, learned in the law, who&s;e attention has lately been em|ployed upon this point, &s;hould have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to provide, by a &s;pe|cial act of parliament, again&s;t this doc|trine, when <HI>the common law of England,</HI> that ought always to be preferred, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>When common law and &s;tatute law concur, the common law &s;hall be preferred.</Q> 4. Co. 71.</NOTE> has already &s;ufficiently guarded us again&s;t the tyrannical con&s;truction of the phra&s;e, which, like a mere bug-bear, is formi|dable only whil&s;t mi&s;under&s;tood, though it has rai&s;ed an epidemical panic, of which
<PB N="8" REF="15">
the late act is a proof. &mdash; <Q>Sunt etiam <HI>aliae res</HI> quae pertinent ad coronam, quae <HI>non &s;unt ita &s;acrae,</HI> quin transfer|ri po&s;&s;unt, &s;icut &s;unt, FUNDI, TERRAE, <HI>et</HI> TENEMENTA, <HI>et</HI> HUJUSMODI per quos corona regis roboratur, et in qui|bus CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA RE|GEM, <HI>&s;icut contra quamlibet privatam per&s;onam.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus we are a&s;&s;ured, by the authority of an ancient and unexceptionable writer, that <HI>crown-lands</HI> are exactly upon <HI>the &s;ame footing</HI> as <HI>private freeholds,</HI> with re&s;pect to <HI>time</HI> or <HI>pre&s;cription,</HI> which is the ve|ry rever&s;e of the <HI>Nullum tempus</HI> doctrine, lately adopted by the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Now, it is a maxim in law, that a quiet and uninterrupted <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> for &s;ixty years creates a proper title. <Q>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io pacifica <HI>POUR ANNS 60</HI> facit jus.</Q> (Prin. Leg. et Aeq. p. 81. See al&s;o Jenk. cent. 26.) And, therefore, as we have be|fore &s;hewn, that <HI>Crown manors, lands,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="16">
and <HI>tenements,</HI> are exactly upon the &s;ame footing with re&s;pect to <HI>time</HI> or pre&s;cription <HI>as private freeholds,</HI> we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily conclude that the king entirely lo&s;es his title to alienated lands, if there are better proofs of &s;uch a <HI>peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> on the one &s;ide, than of <HI>a continued claim</HI> on the other; in which ca&s;e the lands mu&s;t become wholly and entirely the property of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. And, even when <HI>alien|ated crown lands</HI> are claimed within any &s;horter term than &s;ixty years, the king <HI>may not &s;eize,</HI> for it is a maxim, <Q>That the <HI>king can di&s;&s;eize no man,</HI> nor be di&s;&s;eized;</Q> (Doctor &amp; Student);<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Item pro maximo habetur in legibus Angliae, quod <HI>nullus pote&s;t dominum regem di&s;&s;ei&s;ire,</HI> NEC DOMI|NUS REX ALIQUEM DISSEISIRE POTERIT, ita quod liberum tenementum per talem di&s;&s;ei&s;inam transfere|tur de rege ad alium, NEC E CONTRA.</Q> Chap. 8.</NOTE> and, even though the king <HI>cannot be di&s;&s;eized,</HI> yet this is not to be con&s;trued &s;o as to annul that intere&s;t, which private per&s;ons acquire, <HI>by time,</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of alie|nated
<PB N="10" REF="17">
lands, for that is &s;ufficiently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by an act of 1 Edw. III. c. 12. which ordains, with re&s;pect to <Q>lands and tenements holden of the king in chief, and <HI>ALIENED WITHOUT LICENCE</HI></Q>&mdash; that the <Q>king &s;hall <HI>NOT HOLD THEM AS FORFEIT</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;e, but</Q>&mdash;<Q>there &s;hall be a rea&s;onable fine taken in Chancery by <HI>DUE PROCESS.</HI></Q> Here is no limited time for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o that the act is as ef|ficacious for tho&s;e who have been <HI>in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion only</HI> 3 <HI>years,</HI> as for tho&s;e who have held 20 <HI>times</HI> 3 <HI>years</HI> as above. See al&s;o 9 Edw. III. c. 2. 21 Jac. c. 25. 8. Hen. VI. c. 9. &sect; 7. and 31 Eliz. c. 11.</P>
<P>By the two la&s;t mentioned acts a peace|able and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>for</HI> 3 <HI>years</HI> creates a right that will ju&s;tify "<HI>keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> WITH FORCE:" but as the king is not ex|pre&s;&s;ly named, I conceive that &s;o &s;hort a time doth not bar his title to any <HI>rea&s;on|able fines,</HI> not prohibited by 12 Char. II.

<HEAD>PART II. Concerning &s;ome Precautions and Conditions nece&s;&s;ary to be ob|&s;erved in the granting of Crown Lands, Tenements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE crown is limited, as well in the mode of <HI>granting,</HI> as in the con|ditions to <HI>be granted;</HI> in&s;omuch that when any grant or lea&s;e is made <HI>contrary to the rules pre&s;cribed by law,</HI> the &s;ame is there|by rendered <HI>null and void.</HI> I &s;hall not pretend to &s;peak of all the particular pre|cautions and conditions nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved on the&s;e occa&s;ions, but only &s;ome few of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, which, I apprehend, have not been &s;o much re|garded <HI>of late</HI> as they ought.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="21">The legi&s;lature hath agreed, and laid it down as a rule, that all the ancient and <HI>military tenures of lands, and</HI> <Q>even <HI>SOCCAGE IN CAPITE,</HI> of the king, and the con&s;equents upon the &s;ame, have been much more burthen&s;ome, grievous, and <HI>PREJUDICIAL,</HI> to the kingdom, than they have been <HI>BENEFICIAL</HI> to the king.</Q> (See Preamble to 12 Cha.

<P>I have, indeed, heard of a foreign i&s;land being granted to a noble lord upon &s;ome &s;uch <HI>antiquated conditions,</HI> whereby he is &s;aid to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as <HI>lord para|mount,</HI> with a peculiar uncon&s;titutional authority; but this, I am willing to pre|&s;ume, is merely report; and, even if it were true, the grant would be innocent enough, becau&s;e it is <HI>null and void in it|&s;elf,</HI> as the king has had no right &s;ince
<PB N="15" REF="22">
