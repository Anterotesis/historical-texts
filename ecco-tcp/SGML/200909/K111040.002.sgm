<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. <HI>PILKINGTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO being entered on a new Scene, I proceed: I got as far as
<HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; but, as it was Winter, the Stage Coach &s;et out but once a
Week, namely on <HI>Mon|day</HI>; and as I did not land till
<HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> I had near a Week to &s;tay at an Inn, an Expence my poor
Pocket could not well afford. But Providence &s;ent me a timely Relief; for as
I was &s;itting with my Land|lady, by her Kitchen Fire, a Gentleman came in,
who knew me; he was going to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Wind proving contrary, 
<PB N="2" REF="9"> he was a Fellow Pri&s;oner, as I may call it, with me; and a
very agreeable one he proved, for he never permitted me to pay a Farthing. My
Landlady, who was really a Gentlewoman, and he, and I, di|verted away the Time
with Ombre, Read|ing, and Pratling, very tolerably: And as the Gentleman knew
my Misfortunes, and had known all my Family, he very gene|rou&s;ly, and not
without many Apologies, gave me three Guineas; a very &s;ea&s;onable
A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Thus we may &s;ee, that 
<Q> 
<L>Each good the virtuous Soul it&s;elf denies,</L> 
<L>The watchful Care of Providence &s;upplies.</L></Q> By this I
was enabled to travel. I learned with great Plea&s;ure, that a Member of
Par|liament and two Gentlemen of the Law, had taken Places in the Coach, and
hoped for an agreeable Journey; but &s;adly di&s;|appointed I was, for
certainly three &s;uch Brutes I never &s;aw; they affronted me every Moment,
becau&s;e I was born in <HI>Ire|land</HI>; and I believe they had not the
Cho|lick, for they made them&s;elves very ea&s;y: <PB N="3" REF="10"> But the
wor&s;t Circum&s;tance of all was, that they u&s;ed to &s;it up drinking all
Night, and forced me to pay my Club for their Wine, though I never even &s;aw
it.</P>
<P>They were great <HI>Walpolians,</HI> and many a Trick in the
Elections did they relate before me, taking it for granted that I was a Fool:
At la&s;t, they very civilly de|manded of me, what Bu&s;ine&s;s I had to
<HI>Lon|don?</HI> So, re&s;olving to divert my&s;elf, I told them, I was going
there in hopes Sir <HI>Robert</HI> would marry me; this made them very merry,
they laughed at my Folly, and I at theirs. At length we picked up a
<HI>Welch</HI> Par&s;on, of whom I had the Ho|nour of making a Conque&s;t,
which afford|ed us great Entertainment, for about fifty Miles. I always
permitted him to pay my Club; but, like a true Levite, he began to offer a
little more of his Civility than I was willing to accept of; &s;o, finding that
would not do, he made me a Pre&s;ent of a Ginger-bread-nut, curiou&s;ly wrapt
up in white Paper, and after making me give him a Promi&s;e to write to him, he
left us.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">As my Fellow-Travellers had ob&s;erved his
amorous Behaviour, and &s;aw him de|liver his Pre&s;ent, they earne&s;tly
reque&s;ted to know what it was; &s;o to oblige them, I &s;hewed it. When we
came to <HI>St. Al|bans,</HI> we were met by a Gentleman in a Coach and Six,
whom they &s;tiled the great Mr. <HI>Mid&mdash;ton,</HI> of
<HI>Chirk-Ca&s;tle</HI> in <HI>Denbigh|&s;hire,</HI> who was related to them
all; &s;o they went into his Coach, and I got two Fe|male Companions. However,
we all baited at the &s;ame Inn at <HI>Barnet,</HI> and this prodigious Man
in&s;i&s;ted on having the Ladies for his Gue&s;ts; and, laying hold of my
Hand, he &s;wore that little <HI>Hibernian</HI> Nymph &s;hould dine with him;
&s;o up Stairs we all went, where he entertained us with an Account of his
ample E&s;tate, &s;aying, it was much larger than the Duke of
<HI>Bedford</HI>'s; but how unworthy he was to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, the Sequel
will &s;hew.</P>
<P>My Adventures with the <HI>Welch</HI> Par&s;on made him laugh very
heartily; and he in|&s;i&s;ted on my keeping my Promi&s;e in writ|ing to him,
a&s;&s;uring me he would take care <PB N="5" REF="12"> the Letter &s;hould go
&s;afe. So, by way of Amu&s;ement, I &s;cribbled as follows: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q> 
<L>Your Ginger-bread, unbroken,</L> 
<L>Remains a true Love Token.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Am a&s;&s;ured, by your honourable Coun|trymen, that you
pa&s;s for a Wit in <HI>Wales</HI>; it is therefore my &s;incere Advice to you,
never to quit it, le&s;t the re&s;t of the World &s;hould be malicious enough
to re|fu&s;e you your due Prai&s;e. As for the Favour you offered to me, why
you offer|ed it like a Prie&s;t, and I refu&s;ed it like a Fool; if you write
to me, direct, To the Right Honourable the Lady <HI>W&mdash;lp&mdash;le,</HI>
in <HI>Downing-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> I will en|deavour to prevail on
my Spou&s;e elect to &s;end you a Fiddle and a Hog&s;head of good
<HI>October,</HI> to entertain your Pari&s;hioners every <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="13">Mr. <HI>Mid&mdash;ton</HI> &s;aid, he thought I

<L>The dreadful Reck'ning! and we &s;mil'd no more.</L></Q> For
our Grandee made us pay our Club! 'tis true, indeed, he writ &s;omething to
make me amends, which was this: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Charmer,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you will leave a Line for me at <HI>Brownjohn</HI>'s
Coffee-Hou&s;e in <HI>Or|mond Street,</HI> and give me a Direction where to
find you, you &s;hall find a Friend in</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>J. M&mdash;n.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>But really I never did, &s;o we parted, and I never &s;aw him
more. The Sample he had given of the Narrowne&s;s of his Heart was &s;ufficient
to di&s;gu&s;t me; and tho' I am not fond of making national Reflections, yet I
would of all things <PB N="7" REF="14"> never tru&s;t a <HI>Welchman,</HI>
le&s;t, as <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> &s;ays of the <HI>Welch</HI> Fairy, he &s;hould
trans|form me into a Piece of toa&s;ted Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>At length I got to <HI>London,</HI> where, after having paid all
Demands, I had three Guineas left, with which the next Day I took a Lodging in
<HI>Berry-Street, St. James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I wrote to <HI>Ireland</HI> to no purpo&s;e it &s;eemed; for I
never got any An&s;wer; &s;o in a very &s;hort Time I was in great
Di&s;|tre&s;s, and knew not what to do. Having heard Mr. <HI>Ed&mdash;d
W&mdash;p&mdash;le</HI> was a very humane Gentleman, I wrote to him, and he
&s;ent me a Letter in return, wherein he promi&s;ed to wait on me the next
Evening, and accordingly came; nay, and &s;ate with me three Hours; at the End
of which Time he told me, he did not know how he could po&s;&s;ibly be of any
Service to me. I told him I had &s;ome Poems, which I intended to print by
Sub|&s;cription, and if he would do me the Ho|nour of promoting it, it was all
the Fa|vour I de&s;ired.&mdash;He an&s;wered, if he undertook it, he &s;hould
certainly neglect <PB N="8" REF="15"> it; but however he would give me &s;ome
Money; &s;o he pulled out his Pur&s;e, and took out five Guineas: Would not any
Per&s;on have then thought them&s;elves &s;ure of them? but according to the
old Pro|verb, <HI>Many a thing falls out between the Lip and the Cup</HI>; the
Gentleman took a &s;econd Thought, and put the Guineas in his Pur&s;e again,
a&s;&s;uring me, it was not convenient for him to part with them.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I believe he is a Bea&s;t without a Heart; for this
is his con&s;tant An&s;wer to every Per&s;on, as I have fre|quently ob&s;erved,
when tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e for Friends and Companions wanted but the
&s;malle&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. So he 
<Q> 
<L>For Poets open Table kept,</L> 
<L>But ne'er con&s;ider'd where they &s;lept;</L> 
<L>Him&s;elf, as rich as fifty Jews,</L> 
<L>Was ea&s;y, tho' they wanted Shoes.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On this I aro&s;e, and told him, as I perceived it was not in his
Inclination to do <PB N="9" REF="16"> me any Service, I would no longer take up
his important Time, and civilly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dod&s;ley</HI> ventured to print THE TRIAL OF CONSTANCY,
by which I got about five Guineas, and a much greater Happine&s;s, the Favour
and Friend&s;hip of the POET LAUREAT. I was advi&s;ed to enclo&s;e one of them
to him, which I did, in as genteel a Letter as I knew how to write: The good
Gentleman came to vi&s;it me, and did me every Act of Friend&s;hip in his
Power; it is to his un|wearied Zeal in my Behalf, that I owe that I yet live to
thank him; for, 
<Q> 
<L>Had I not been by him &s;upply'd,</L> 
<L>I mu&s;t a thou&s;and Times have dy'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here omit, that when the Poem was publi&s;hed, I
enclo&s;ed two of them to Mr. <HI>W&mdash;lp&mdash;le,</HI> who wrote me a
Letter of Thanks, and that was all: <HI>Mem.</HI> he owes me Two Shillings.</P>
<P>As I wanted to make Intere&s;t with the Great, I took a Lodging in
<HI>St. James</HI>'s <PB N="10" REF="17"> <HI>Street,</HI> exactly oppo&s;ite
to <HI>White</HI>'s Choco|late-hou&s;e, where happening to &s;ee Capt.
<HI>Meade</HI> go in, I wrote over to him, and he was &s;o kind to give me an
Invitation to his Hou&s;e, which was within a &s;mall Mile from
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> a delightful Walk through <HI>Bu&s;hy-Park</HI> leading
to it: This &s;aved me a great deal of Expence: for as the Parliament was now
broke up, <HI>London</HI> was quite empty, and Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> being gone
to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> I could not, 'till the Return of Winter, hope to gain
any Sub|&s;cribers, &s;o I went into the Country with great Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Captain had a very &s;weet Dwelling, a pretty Wife, and four
lovely Children. We went to Church the following <HI>Sunday:</HI> Dr.
<HI>Hales</HI> was Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, and it was cu&s;tomary with him,
whenever he &s;aw a Stranger in his Congregation, to pay them a Vi&s;it; &s;o,
after Evening Prayer, we were honoured with his Company. Capt. <HI>Meade</HI>
told him, I was his Si&s;ter Par&s;on and Si&s;ter Writer; a merry Sort of an
Introduction. The Doctor a&s;ked me, what I wrote? and the Captain an|&s;wered 
<PB N="11" REF="18"> for me, that I was going to pub|li&s;h a Volume of Poems
by Sub&s;cription. I told the Doctor, my Writings might amu&s;e, but his made
the World the wi&s;er and the better, as I had had the Plea&s;ure of reading
them. I turned the Di&s;cour&s;e to Natural Philo&s;phy, on which the Doctor
gave us an Invitation to a Cour&s;e of Ex|periments the next Day. Tho' nothing
I then &s;aw was new to me, yet his Reflec|tions on every Object were, as by
them he demon&s;trated the Divinity; and, wrapt in holy Exta&s;y, he &s;oared
above this little terrene Spot, and, like a true High Prie&s;t, led his
Auditors up to the Holie&s;t of Holies.</P>
<P>After this &s;acred Banquet, with which my Soul was &s;o elevated,
that I could not avoid paying him my Acknowledgments in, I believe, an
enthu&s;ia&s;tic Strain, we walked into the Garden, where we were entertained
with &s;ome fine Fruit, Cream, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a rural Collation.</P>
<P>The Doctor a&s;ked me, if I had any printed Propo&s;als for my
Poems, to which he promi&s;ed not only to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf, but al&s;o
to u&s;e his Intere&s;t for me; I told <PB N="12" REF="19"> him I had, and that
I would give him &s;ome when I came to Prayers the next Morning.</P>
<P>But I could not &s;leep all Night, &s;o at Day-break I aro&s;e,
and walked into <HI>Bu&s;hy-Park</HI>; I &s;at down by the Side of a fine
Ca&s;cade, and li&s;tened to the tunefully-fall|ling Waters &s;o long, that
methought they became vocal, and uttered articulate Sounds; 'till, lulled by
them, I fell in|&s;en&s;ibly a&s;leep, when &s;uddenly I imagined the
Water-Nymph, to whom this Spring belonged, aro&s;e before me with a lovely
Countenance, and a tran&s;parent azure Robe, and putting a Paper into my Hand,
di&s;appeared. I thought I read it; and as I pre&s;ently awoke, I remembered
all the Lines; &s;o, having a Pencil and Sheet of Paper in my Pocket, I wrote
them down.

<P>After this plea&s;ing Reverie, I returned home, and had
&s;ufficient Time to tran&s;|cribe the Lines fair, and dre&s;s my&s;elf ere the
Bell rung for Morning Prayer. As we were coming out of Church, I gave the Poem
and &s;ome Propo&s;als, made up in a Pacquet, to the Doctor; who came in the
Evening to vi&s;it us, and brought an|other Clergyman with him, who was the
Mini&s;ter of <HI>Henley upon Thames</HI>; they both &s;ub&s;cribed to me, and
took a good many of the Propo&s;als, which they di&s;po&s;ed of to Per&s;ons of
Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">So having got a little Money, and Capt.

returned to <HI>St. James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>My good Friend Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was my fir&s;t Vi&s;itor: He
had got about four Gui|neas for me; and told me, he was a&s;&s;ured, by a

<P>This met with a very favourable Recep|tion, and Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI> &s;hewed it to all the <PB N="21" REF="28"> Noblemen at
<HI>White</HI>'s, as a Means to engage them to &s;ub&s;cribe to me, which, to
oblige him, many of them did; and, to make it public, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>
in&s;erted it in a Pam|phlet of his own called the <HI>Egoti&s;t,</HI> or
<HI>Colley upon Cibber.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day a plea&s;ant droll Gentleman, who was &s;o old that
he had been Page to King <HI>James</HI> when he was Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
in&s;i&s;ted on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s introducing him to me, which accordingly
he did. This Gentleman, who was a Colonel in the fir&s;t Regiment of Foot
Guards, had by Nature all that Education gives to others; neither had his Years
in the lea&s;t depre&s;t the Vi|vacity or Gallantry of his Spirit. He &s;aid a
thou&s;and witty Things in half an Hour, and at la&s;t, with as great Gravity
as his comic Face would admit of, &s;aid, that he wi&s;hed I would take him
into Keep|ing. I an&s;wered, I had really never &s;een any Per&s;on with whom I
was better enter|tained, and, therefore, if he would make over all his real and
per&s;onal E&s;tate to me, and di&s;po&s;e of his Regiment, and give me the
Money, I would keep him&mdash;<PB N="22" REF="29"> out of it. He &s;wore a good
Oath, he be|lieved me, and liked me for my Sinceri|ty.&mdash;I could relate a
Number of plea&s;ant Stories of this old Gentleman; but as his Wit generally
bordered on Indecen|cy, and &s;ometimes on Prophanene&s;s, they are not proper
for a female Pen.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed to hire me to write Love Let|ters to him, which, as a
Proof of his being a young Man, he &s;hewed at <HI>White</HI>'s; Lord
<HI>W&mdash;m&mdash;th</HI> was curious to &s;ee the Writer; upon which he
brought his Lord&s;hip, and Lord <HI>Aug&mdash;&s;tus F&mdash;tz
R&mdash;y,</HI> &s;ince dead, to vi&s;it me. They bantered me on my Ta&s;te, in
writing &s;o many fine Things to an old Fellow, when &s;o many young ones,
them&s;elves in particular, would be proud of them&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured their
Lord&s;hips, I would oblige them on the &s;ame Terms I did the Colonel, who
always paid me hand|&s;omely for my Compliments.</P>
<P>This turned all their Raillery on the Co|lonel, who with great
good Humour con|fe&s;&s;ed the Truth. 
<Q REND="inline">"Why Colonel, &s;aid Lord <HI>F&mdash;z
R&mdash;y,</HI> you told us you &s;up|ported <PB N="23" REF="30"> this
Lady."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, returned he, but you know I am an old
Lyar."</Q></P>
<P>The Noblemen in&s;i&s;ted on my telling them how much a piece the
Colonel gave me for writing Billetdoux to him. The Colonel an&s;wered, that his
Money had been fatal to my Family; for that he had lent my Uncle Colonel
<HI>Mead</HI> twenty Guineas one Night at the Groom Porters, who died the next
Morning of an Apoplectic Fit; and &s;o, &s;aid he, 
<Q REND="inline">"out of pure Af|fection to my dear little one
here, I am very cautious how I give her any; be|&s;ides, added he, very archly,
I could not be convinced of the Sincerity of her Pa&s;&s;ion for me, if &s;he
made any De|mands on my Pocket."</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>W&mdash;m&mdash;th</HI> a&s;ked me, how I approved of
this Doctrine? I an&s;wered, the Colonel, had &s;o genteel and witty a manner
of excu&s;ing his Avarice, that &s;hould he ever grow generous, we &s;hould
lo&s;e a thou&s;and Plea&s;antries.</P>
<P>Each of the Noblemen gave me a Guinea, by way of Sub&s;cription to
my Poems; they pre&s;&s;ed hard on the Colonel <PB N="24" REF="31"> for his
Contribution, which, for the Rea|&s;ons afore&s;aid, he ab&s;olutely
refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This gave Occa&s;ion to the following Lines; which, le&s;t the
Colonel &s;hould not communicate, I inclo&s;ed to Lord
<HI>F&mdash;z-R&mdash;y.</HI>

<L>And tho&s;e, as you &s;ay, never ought to be &s;old,</L>
<L>For Love's too divine, to be barter'd for Gold.</L>
<L>Since this is your Maxim, I beg a Re|ceipt,</L>
<L>To know, how without it a Lover can eat.</L>
<L>For tho' the fine Heroes, we read in Ro|mances,</L>
<L>Sub&s;i&s;ted whole Weeks upon amorous Fancies;</L>

<L>Who neither can ki&s;s, nor write Ver&s;es, in

<P><PB N="26" REF="33">Lord <HI>A&mdash;&s;tus</HI> did not fail to

<P>The next Day, as I was &s;prinkling &s;ome Flower-pots, which
&s;tood on very broad Leads, under the Dining-room Window, Colonel
<HI>D&mdash;nc&mdash;be,</HI> the Duke of <HI>B&mdash;lt&mdash;n,</HI> and the

acquainted with any of them, except the Colonel, I &s;ent over to him the&s;e
Lines: 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L>YOUR ro&s;y Wine</L>
<L>Looks bright and fine;</L>
<L>But yet it does not chear me:</L>
<L>The Cau&s;e I gue&s;s,</L>
<L>Is &s;urely this,</L>
<L>The Bottle is not near me.</L>
</LG> 
<LG>
<L>You &s;hew that Sight,</L>
<L>To give Delight,</L>
<L>If I may truly judge ye:</L>
<L>But would ye move</L>
<L>My Wit, or Love,</L>
<L>I beg, Sir, I may pledge ye.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34">Lord <HI>W&mdash;nch&mdash;ea</HI> bid the
Colonel &s;end me all the Wine in the Hou&s;e: 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! (&s;aid the Colonel) that might in|jure her
Health, but I will &s;end her one Bottle of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to chear her
Spirits."</Q> Accordingly the Waiter brought it; the Noblemen all gathered to
the Window, &s;o he filled me out a Gla&s;s, which, mak|ing them a low
Reverence, I drank, and retired.</P>
<P>But the Colonel, re&s;olving to have Share, quickly followed his
Bottle; he came in a de&s;perate ill Temper; cur&s;ed the K&mdash;g, D&mdash;
of <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;d,</HI> the whole M&mdash;y, and me into the Bargain. I
a&s;ked him, whether giving me a Bottle of Wine had grieved him &s;o much? He
&s;aid, No; but that he had been fifty Years in the Army, and was but
Lieute|nant-Colonel; and that the D&mdash; of <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;d</HI> had
put a young Fellow over his Head. He pulled down his Stocking, and &s;hewed me
where he had been &s;hot through the Leg at the Siege of <HI>Li&s;le</HI>; then
he opened his Bo&s;om, on <PB N="28" REF="35"> which he had &s;everal
honourable Scars, and &s;wore heartily, that, were it not in a Time of War, he
would throw up his Commi&s;&s;ion. I could not but agree, that his Re&s;entment
had but too ju&s;t a Foun|dation; 
<Q REND="inline">"But, dear Sir, I had no hand in all this."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No; (&s;aid he) but I did not know any Per&s;on,
to whom I could &s;peak my Mind freely, or who would bear my Peevi&s;hne&s;s,
but you."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, (&s;aid I) an you were as pee|vi&s;h
as an Emperor, I'll bear it all, &s;ince you plea&s;e to be&s;tow it on
me.&mdash;But I believe we had as good drink our <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and we will
new model the Government according to our Fancies."</Q> He &s;at very
pen&s;ive, &s;aid his Head aked, then ro&s;e in a &s;urly Sort of a manner, and
went over to <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Whether any thing he had met with there plea&s;ed him, I know not,
but about Nine at Night, as I &s;at writing, I heard his Voice on the Stairs,
crying, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poke after me, my Lord, poke after me."</Q> So I
bid my Maid, light the Colonel up: He brought with him his Grace of 
<PB N="29" REF="36"> <HI>M&mdash;lb&mdash;gh,</HI> a lovely Gentleman; he
pre&s;ented him to me, by his Title, which was honoured by his wearing it. The
D&mdash; &s;aluted me; but what &s;hall I now &s;ay! I think my boa&s;ted
Con&s;tancy of Mind quite for&s;ook me; I trembled at his Touch, and, though I
knew not why, was more di&s;ordered at Sight of him, than ever I had been
before in my Life. The Colonel a&s;ked me, what was the Matter? I &s;aid, I
believed I had drank too much Tea, which, joined to the unex|pected Honour he
had now conferred on me, put me into a little Flutter.</P>
<P>His Grace laid hold of my Hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it, &s;aying, it
was the &s;weete&s;t Thing in Nature, to put a Lady into a little Hurry of
Spirits, 
<Q REND="inline">"and &s;o, &s;aid he, Colonel, I &s;hall meet you
at <HI>White</HI>'s, either to-night or to-morrow Morn|ing; for I have a mind
to have a little Chat with this Lady alone."</Q> The Colonel knew his Duty too
well to di&s;obey a <HI>M&mdash;lb&mdash;gh,</HI> and left us, wi&s;hing his
Grace Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">Now, indeed, for the fir&s;t Time, I was
afraid of my&s;elf; but was infinitely more &s;o, when his Grace told me, he
had learned from the Colonel, that I was in &s;ome Di&s;tre&s;s, and, opening
his Pocket-Book, pre&s;ented me with a Bank Note on Sir <HI>Francis Child</HI>
for Fifty Pounds.</P>
<P>This was the Ordeal, or fiery Trial; Youth, Beauty, Nobility of
Birth, and un&s;ought Genero&s;ity, attacking at once the mo&s;t de&s;olate
Per&s;on in the World. His Grace, I believe, gue&s;&s;ed at my
Ap|prehen&s;ions, by the Concern which was but too vi&s;ible in my Countenance,
and generou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured me, that he was above making any hard Conditions,
that I might look up with Chearfulne&s;s, and not rivet my Eyes to the Floor,
but con&s;ider him as a &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted Friend.</P>
<P>This quite revived me, and gave me an unu&s;ual Flow of Spirits,
which highly plea&s;ed my illu&s;trious Benefactor: He de|&s;ired I would write
&s;omething merry to the Colonel, who, at his Departure, charged me not to
wrong his Bed. So to plea&s;e his Grace, and al&s;o to convince him I 
<PB N="31" REF="38"> could write, I gave him, in about ten Minutes, the
following Lines. 
<Q> 
<LG>
<L><HI>STREPHON</HI> to-night his <HI>Chloe</HI> told,</L>
<L>He had the Head-ach, and grew old;</L>
<L>Tho' well &s;he knew her artful Swain</L>
<L>But counterfeited Age and Pain,</L>
<L>To hide his cold declining Pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>His Want of Love and Inclination;</L>
<L>For <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Face, &s;o often &s;een,</L>
<L>Put her poor <HI>Strephon</HI> in the Spleen;</L>
<L>Nor could her Wit, or Neatne&s;s plea&s;e him,</L>
<L>Or all her Smiles or Prattle rai&s;e him:</L>

<L>His painful Ab&s;ence to bemoan.</L>

<L>Con&s;ider I have <HI>Sp&mdash;n&mdash;r</HI> &s;een,</L>
<L>And quickly lay a&s;ide your Spleen;</L>
<L>Or, by the God of Ver&s;e, I vow,</L>

<L>No City Knight &s;hall boa&s;t a Pair</L>
<L>More large, more branching, or more fair:</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="39">Their Horns are gilt, but yours &s;hall

</LG>

<L>So, Sir, no more of your Deception,</L>
<L>For I am ble&s;t with quick Perception;</L>

<L>Then lay a&s;ide this little Art,</L>
<L>I have, and I will keep your Heart.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>His Grace was very well plea&s;ed with my Gaity, and undertook to
deliver the Letter him&s;elf; &s;o we parted, each of us, I believe,
&s;atisfied with our&s;elves, and our own Conduct.</P>
<P>I know at lea&s;t I was; for upon calling my Heart to account for
the Trouble it had given me, I found by the Symptoms, there was &s;omething
very like Love had &s;eized it.</P>
<P>The Colonel came in the Morning, and brought with him Mr.
<HI>Tr&mdash;v&mdash;r,</HI> Brother to the D&mdash;&s;s of
<HI>M&mdash;lb&mdash;gh,</HI> whom he introduced to me, and then merrily
a&s;ked me, if I was going to re|ward his con&s;tant tender Flame, with a 
<PB N="33" REF="40"> great &s;taring Pair of Horns? I told him he de&s;erved
them for his ill Temper; but, however, as he made me full amends by the Honour
of making me known to &s;o great and good a Man as he had recom|mended me to, I
would take &s;ome Time to con&s;ider of the Matter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tr&mdash;v&mdash;r</HI> de&s;ired to know which of the
<HI>Sp&mdash;n&mdash;r</HI>'s it was, I threatned the Colonel with? I told him,
I wrote any thing by way of Amu&s;ement; but either of them would &s;erve my
Turn.</P>
<P>The Colonel called me a merry Madcap; Mr.
<HI>Tr&mdash;v&mdash;r</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, he was at my Service, and would
horni&s;y the Colonel whenever I plea&s;ed. I told him, I was ob|liged to him
for his kind Offer, and would certainly apply to him, if I found my&s;elf in
any Di&s;tre&s;s; and in the mean Time, I hoped, as an earne&s;t of his future
Favour, he would be &s;o kind as to &s;ub&s;cribe to my Poems, which
accordingly he did.</P>
<P>My Readers may now imagine, I was in a fair Way of growing rich;
but, in|deed, it was far otherwi&s;e, as I paid a Gui|nea a Week for my

and, in return for my Ea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid every thing of me which they thought
could injure, or expo&s;e me; that being naturally liberal, and, till I
heartily &s;uffered for my Folly, no very great Oeconomi&s;t, I rather ran out
than &s;aved.</P>
<P>And, as I have thrown &s;ome Sort of Reflection on the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave to be equally free with my own Country
Folks. Take Notice, I except the Nobility and Gentry of each Kingdom, who, I
real|ly believe, in Honour, Valour, or Genero|&s;ity of Spirit, are not be
matched in any Part of the habitable Globe. Yet, partial as I may be to my
native Country, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;eem to have
different Characteri&s;tics: The lower Part of the People of <HI>England</HI>
are blunt and hone&s;t; the lower Part of the People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> civil
and deceitful: Nor did I ever &s;uffer in <HI>England,</HI> either in point of
Fortune or <PB N="35" REF="42"> Reputation, but either by the Thefts, or the
Tongues of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>My Landlady came up one Morning very chearful, and told me her
Daughter's Hu&s;band, Dr. <HI>T&mdash;rn&mdash;ll,</HI> who had not been to
&s;ee her for two Years, on account of &s;ome Difference they had, told her he
would, as he was to preach at <HI>St. James</HI>'s Chapel next Day, (being one
of the Chap|lains to his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>) take up
his Lodging in her Hou&s;e that Night. I congratulated hereupon it; but
ob&s;erving by her Looks that &s;he was under &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, I a&s;ked
her the Cau&s;e of it; after &s;ome He&s;itation, and a Number of Apologies,
&s;he told me, &s;he had no Accommodation for him, but by giving him her own
Bed, and begged I would, for a Night, give her leave to &s;leep with me and my
Maid, to which I readily con|&s;ented; but recollecting what a mi&s;erable Bed
&s;he had, in a dark Clo&s;et, very unfit for a Gentleman to lie in, I told
her, I would, with great Plea&s;ure, leave my A|partment for the Doctor, which
was, as may be pre&s;umed by the Price, a genteel <PB N="36" REF="43"> one, and
for a Night take up my Re&s;i|dence with her. She &s;eemed overjoyed at the
Propo&s;al, and as I had &s;ome little Trifle to buy, I went out, and did not
return till about Six in the Evening; &s;o not meeting any body in the Way
below Stairs, I went up to my own Apartment, where I found the Doctor reading,
and the old Gentle|woman fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I begged pardon for my Intru&s;ion, and the old Dame told him how
much he was indebted to my Complai&s;ance in quitting my Apartment to oblige
him with it. I could have wi&s;hed, &s;he had been &s;ilent in this particular;
for as &s;he had not apprized him of it before, he was too polite to &s;uffer
it, nor could any Entreaties of mine prevail on him to accept my Offer.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after, being gone down Stairs, he &s;ent his
Compliments up, and begged I would lend him a Book to amu&s;e him|&s;elf till
Bed-time, &s;o being willing to cul|tivate the good Opinion he &s;eemed to have
conceived of me, I &s;ent him my own Po|ems in Manu&s;cript, which, pardon my
Vanity, did not fail to confirm it.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44">The next Day, which was <HI>Sunday,</HI> as
&s;oon as Afternoon Service was over, he very kindly paid me a Vi&s;it, and
&s;eemed &s;o well plea&s;ed with my Prattle, that it was Midnight before
either of us thought of Repo&s;e: But I do a&s;&s;ure my Readers his
Mother-in-law kept us Company.</P>
<P>He entertained me with an Account of whatever he had met with
curious in his Travels: His Remarks on every Subject were delivered with
Mode&s;ty and Judgment, in a flowing and elegant Style. He was &s;o kind to
promi&s;e me the Favour of taking a Di&s;h of Coffee with me in the Morning,
which produced a merry Adventure.</P>
<P>The Noblemen at <HI>White</HI>'s, having heard that I was married
to a Clergyman, and &s;eeing one walking to and fro in my Din|ing-room,
&s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t be the very identical Par&s;on, and that he was come to
make up Matters with me; &s;o none of them would venture over, le&s;t it
&s;hould incur his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t me; but Colonel
<HI>D&mdash;nc&mdash;be,</HI> who&s;e Curio&s;ity was up, re|&s;olved at a
Di&s;tance to reconnoitre the <PB N="38" REF="45"> Ground, and bring them a
faithful Account of the Enemy's Situation, for &s;o he &s;tiled the
Par&s;on.</P>
<P>There was a very grand Milliner's Shop next Door to my Lodging,
from whence I received a Me&s;&s;age, that a Lady, ju&s;t come from
<HI>Ireland,</HI> de&s;ired to &s;peak with me; upon which I immediately went,
full of Hope to receive &s;ome Account of my Children: I there found the
Colonel, who told me, he was the Lady; and, with his u&s;ual Gaity, added, that
if I que&s;tioned his Sex, I need but permit him to be my Bedfellow for a Week,
and I &s;hould never know any thing to the contrary.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, I really believed him; in|a&s;much as I had known a
Gentleman, young enough to be his Grand&s;on, who had lived with me in all the
peacable Innocence of a Man of Three&s;core, like a civil carele&s;s Hu&s;band,
as he was.</P>
<P>As the Colonel was acquainted with my Hi&s;tory, he laughed
heartily, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t be &s;ome damned Par&s;on, for nobody
(&s;aid he) but one belonging to <PB N="39" REF="46"> the Church could have had
half that Continency. But, my dear little one, (for that was the Name he always
called me), I have &s;ome News to tell you; I de&s;ire you may bru&s;h up your
Counte|nance, your Fire, and your&s;elf, becau&s;e you are likely to have
&s;ome very grand Vi&s;itors to-morrow; no le&s;s than Mr.
<HI>St&mdash;h&mdash;e,</HI> the Earl of <HI>W&mdash;nch&mdash;ea,</HI> and his
Brother Mr. <HI>F&mdash;ch.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Colonel then told me the Rea&s;on of his &s;ending for me in
that manner was, that he had ob&s;erved a Pa&s;on walking in my Room; and
a&s;ked, who it was? I told him, it was Dr. <HI>T&mdash;bull,</HI> no way
re|lated to me.</P>
<P>As this Adventure with the Clergyman afforded great Matter of
Diver&s;ion at <HI>White</HI>'s, I cannot help here relating ano|ther. I was in
very great Di&s;tre&s;s, and was advi&s;ed to apply to the then Lord
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> now, by the Grace of God, Lord Archbi&s;hop of
<HI>Canterbury</HI>; I &s;ay, by the Grace of God, becau&s;e I be|lieve he
never was yet excelled by any of the primitive Bi&s;hops; a Per&s;on, in whom 
<PB N="40" REF="47"> the Beauty of Holine&s;s fully appears. I went to his
Hou&s;e, in <HI>Ken&s;ington-&s;quare,</HI> and, to my infinite Surprize, had
free Ac|ce&s;s to his Grace, without even a Que&s;tion being a&s;ked: I
pre&s;ented him with the fol|lowing Lines.</P>
<P>This Poem was written ju&s;t at the Begin|ning of the Rebellion,
in which his Grace, like a true Son of the Church militant, had nobly taken up
Arms in the Defence of Liberty, Property, and the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion.</P>
<P>Having been obliged to the Right Ho|nourable <HI>Henry
Pelham,</HI> I thought it not improper to include two &s;uch great and eminent
Per&s;ons in one Poem, which was as follows: 
<Q> 
<LG>

<L>AS God, who now does, as in Times of old,</L>

</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I told the Servant, when I delivered them, it was not a Petition:
He &s;aid, if it were, his Grace never refu&s;ed one; and &s;hewed me into a
hand&s;ome Drawing-Room. In a few Minutes, his Grace en|tered, with a &s;weet
and placid Air; but looked &s;o young, that I never once ima|gined him to be
the Archbi&s;hop, having joined the a&s;&s;ociate Idea of Wrinkles, Ava|rice,
and Pride, to that Title,&mdash;in which I found my&s;elf, happily for once,
mi&s;ta|ken. As it was early in the Morning, he <PB N="45" REF="52"> &s;aid, he
was &s;ure I had not breakfa&s;ted, and bid one of the Servants bring &s;ome
Tea, and de&s;ire his Cou&s;in to come, and keep the Lady Company: As it was
near half an Hour before I &s;aw her, his Grace a&s;ked me, who I was? I
an&s;wered, which was Truth, I was a Gentleman's Daugh|ter, of the Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI>; that I had, when I was very young, been married to a
Clergyman; that I had three Children living. His Grace, taking it for granted,
that I was a Widow, which Mi&s;take it was, by no Means, my Intere&s;t to clear
up, demanded of me, what I had to &s;up|port us? I an&s;wered, Nothing but
Po|etry. He &s;aid, that was a Pity; becau&s;e, let it be ever &s;o excellent,
Genius was &s;el|dom rewarded, or encouraged; I very gayly repeated the Dean's
Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>What Hope of Cu&s;tom in the Fair,</L> 
<L>When not a Soul demands the Ware?</L> 
<L>When you have nothing to produce,</L> 
<L>For private Life, or public U&s;e.</L> 
<BIBL>Swift's Rhap&s;ody.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="46" REF="53"> His
Grace could not avoid &s;miling, as he plainly perceived by the Chearfulne&s;s,
and Freedom of my Behaviour, and by my only &s;aying, Sir, to him, that I was
igno|rant of his Dignity. But the Entrance of his Relation, a well-bred Lady,
of about fifty Years of Age, who, as his Grace is a Batchelor, managed his
dome&s;tic Affairs, threw me into inconceivable Confu&s;ion, as I then plainly
perceived I had been very familiarly chatting with &s;o great a Man.</P>
<P>I made my Apology in the be&s;t Man|ner I could; and, as he was
truly &s;en&s;ible that I neither intended or meant Di&s;re|&s;pect to him, he
ea&s;ily pardoned me: But, as we drank Tea, &s;aid, he wi&s;hed my Mi&s;take
had but continued a little longer, that he might have had the Plea&s;ure of
hearing me unawed and uncontrolled. I own I was quite aba&s;hed at &s;o odd a
Cir|cum&s;tance, for while I imagined his Grace to be perhaps a Chaplain to the
Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> I &s;aid any thing without Re&s;erve; but,
of a &s;udden, found my Spirits fail, which brought <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s
Lines into my Mind: 
<Q><PB N="47" REF="54"> 
<L>And what have Kings, that Privates have not too,</L> 
<L>Save Ceremony, general Ceremony?</L> 
<L>And what are thou, thou Idol Ceremony?</L> 
<L>What kind of God art thou, that &s;uffere&s;t more</L> 
<L>Of mortal Griefs, than do thy Wor&s;hip|pers;</L> 
<L>What are thy Rents? What are thy Comings in?</L> 
<L>Oh Ceremony! &s;hew me but thy Worth:</L> 
<L>What is thy Soul of Adoration?</L> 
<L>Art thou aught el&s;e, but Place, Degree, and Form;</L> 
<L>Creating Fear and Awe in other Men?</L> 
<L>Wherein thou art le&s;s happy, being fear'd,</L> 
<L>Than they in fearing thee.</L></Q> His Grace was &s;o humane,
to make me a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent at my Departure, and a&s;&s;ured me, he would
always be a Friend to me.</P>
<P>However, I did not make a &s;econd Ap|plication to him, 'till
&s;uch Time as the Royal Bounty is to be petitioned for, <PB N="48" REF="55">
is at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> though it is not di&s;tributed 'till
<HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> As I knew, at that Sea&s;on of the Year, it was
impo&s;&s;ible for me to be at <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> e'er his Grace would be
at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> I waited at the Door of the Robing-Room, 'till I
was almo&s;t frozen, holding a Petition, inclo&s;ed in a Letter, in my Hand; a
Gentleman, who is Door-keeper to the Hou&s;e of Lords, taking Compa&s;&s;ion on
me, told me, I had better come into the Lobby, an Offer I readily accepted of,
and &s;at down in a Window: There were &s;everal Noblemen, mo&s;t of whom knew
me by Sight, walking in it, as the Hou&s;e was not yet met. The fir&s;t Prelate
who entered, was the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> a venerable Gentleman,
who&s;e graceful grey Hairs the Hand of Time had &s;ilvered: As he pa&s;t by, I
made him a Courte&s;y, on which he &s;topt, and, with great Civility, a&s;ked
me if that Letter was for him; I an&s;wered, it was for his Grace of
<HI>York</HI>; on which, he very kindly wi&s;hed me Succe&s;s. His Grace next
entered, and with his wonted Goodne&s;s a&s;ked me, where I had been? Adding,
that it had <PB N="49" REF="56"> been a great Lo&s;s to me, that he did not
know where to find me; and accepting of my Letter, &s;aid, he hoped I had there
given him a proper Direction; &s;o bowing, as fa&s;t as I courte&s;ied, he went
to take his Seat at the Right Hand of that Power he had &s;o nobly &s;upported;
and, no doubt, will, at the la&s;t great Day, having truly approved him&s;elf
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s faithful Soldier and Champion, fighting under the &s;acred
Banners of the Captain of his Salvation, hear tho&s;e comfortable Words,
<HI>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy
Lord.</HI></P>
<P>As the Earl of <HI>Ch&mdash;&s;ter&mdash;ld</HI> heard every Word
his Grace &s;poke to me, he made him&s;elf very merry at <HI>White</HI>'s,
telling Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and Colonel <HI>D&mdash;nc&mdash;be,</HI> that I
was true to the Gown, and delivered a Billet-doux to the hand&s;ome&s;t,
polite&s;t, and brave&s;t Prelate in <HI>Europe</HI>; that I had given him a
Direction where to find me, and highly applauded my Choice.</P>
<P>But no Virtue is above the Reach of a little plea&s;ant Raillery;
and as &s;ome of the Noblemen demanded an Explanation <PB N="50" REF="57"> of
this Affair, I with my u&s;ual Sincerity, told them the Truth; on which they
all agreed in prai&s;ing his Beneficence and Af|fability, and the hand&s;ome
Manner in which he be&s;towed his Bounties.</P>
<P>I hope, if the&s;e <HI>Memoirs</HI> &s;hould ever fall into his
Grace's Hands, who is an uni|ver&s;al Reader, he will pardon me for u&s;ing his
Name, which I &s;hall never do, but with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect and
Gratitude.</P>
<P>As I had imagined his Grace to be Lord High Almoner, I
addre&s;&s;ed him as &s;uch, and waited on him again at
<HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>; his Grace told me, the B&mdash;p of
<HI>S&mdash;y</HI> had been &s;o kind to accept of my Petition, and that I
mu&s;t wait on him the next Morning, at his Hou&s;e in the <HI>Temple:</HI> So
accordingly, I went, in full Spirits, imagining, on the Recommenda|tion of &s;o
excellent a Per&s;on, I &s;hould both have a civil Reception, and al&s;o my
De&s;ire an&s;wered.</P>
<P>It &s;nowed very fa&s;t, and I knocked &s;e|veral Times, e'er I
could gain Admi&s;|&s;ion; at length, an old Porter ventured to turn the
unoiled Hinges a little, which <PB N="51" REF="58"> grated very har&s;hly, and
&s;eemed to par|take of the Spirit of their unho&s;pitable Ma&s;ter, who,
according to my Country|man's Bull, opened the Door to keep the People out, for
this was fully verified here; he a&s;ked me, what I knocked &s;o often for? and
being, I &s;uppo&s;e, doubtful that I might &s;teal one of the Oak Chairs in
the Hall, &s;hut it again in my Face; the Inclemency of the Air, and the
Vexa|tion of my Mind, made me give a thun|dering Rap, the Door was once more
opened, and I a&s;&s;ured the Porter, if he would be &s;o kind as to deliver
that Letter for me to his Lord, to whom I was re|commended by his Grace of
<HI>York,</HI> I would give him Half a Crown, which Promi&s;e of a Perqui&s;ite
&s;oftened him into Con&s;ent, for, as Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q> 
<L>This Rea&s;on with all is prevailing.</L></Q></P>
<P>He took the Letter into the Parlour, when pre&s;ently an old Man,
with a mo&s;t unprelatical Countenance, for it was full of Carbunckles, and
Knobs, and Flames of <PB N="52" REF="59"> Fire, came out, with my Letter in his
Hand, and, with an imperious Voice, de|manded of me, whether I wrote it? As the
Times were full of Violence and Blood, it being, as I ob&s;erved, at the
Beginning of the late Rebellion, I &s;tood confounded, and knew not what
An&s;wer to make; which he ob&s;erving, a&s;ked me, was my Name <HI>Meade?</HI>
To which, an|&s;wering in the affirmative, he cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Yow are a Foreigner, and we have Beggars enow of
our own:"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord, returned I, I was born in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> which is not a foreign Country, but equally a Part of his
Maje&s;ty's Dominions with <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, &s;aid he very politely, you lye; but as you
&s;ay yow are in Di&s;tre&s;s, there's Half a Crown for yow:"</Q> I thanked his
Lord&s;hip, and turning to the Porter told him, as I had given him &s;ome
Trouble, I hoped he would accept of that Part of the Royal Bounty, which had
been promi&s;ed to me; his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to tell me, I was a
&s;aucy, proud, impertinent Per&s;on; which, <PB N="53" REF="60"> having
neither any farther Hopes or Fears about him, I little regarded.</P>
<P>All the Way Home, as cold as it was, and as much vexed as I was at
the old Br&mdash;te's Behaviour, I could not avoid laughing at his odd Figure,
&s;o much re|&s;embling that of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Friar, where 
<Q>His great Belly &s;waggered in State before him, and his little
gouty Legs came limping after; oh, he is a huge Tun of Divinity! and were he
any way given to Holine&s;s, I would &s;wear by his Face; my Oath &s;hould be,
By this Fire; but he is indeed, but for the Fire in his Face, the Son of utter
Dark|ne&s;s; oh! he is a perpetual Triumph, an everla&s;ting Bon&s;ire!</Q></P>
<P>Then again I thought of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>G&mdash;d d&mdash;n me, they bid us reform and repent;</L> 
<L>But, Z&mdash;ds, by their Looks, they never keep
<HI>Lent.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">I hope the Reader will pardon me, for
in&s;erting Oaths, as I have &s;o great an Au|thority to quote for them.</P>
<P>As the Parliament did not &s;it during the Holydays, I waited on
his Grace of <HI>York,</HI> who immediately gave me Audience: He a&s;ked me,
what Succe&s;s I had with the Lord Almoner; and as I had &s;ped mar|vellous
ill-favouredly, I related every Cir|cum&s;tance, as near as I could remember of
our Conver&s;ation; One, in particu|lar, which I before omitted, and was, that
he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Would the Lord Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI>
&s;peak to yow, Woman?"</Q> His Grace &s;miled, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"It was the fir&s;t Time he ever learned it was
beneath the Dignity of a Bi&s;hop to &s;peak, even to a Beggar; as Humliity was
their be&s;t Orna|ment:&mdash;Well, What more?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Not much, my Lord, only he demanded, If I knew no
other Per&s;on, be&s;ides your Grace, to recommend me to him? And as I really
was convinced, I had brought him my Credentials from the highe&s;t, I did not

<P>And &s;ince, from the Great, I have di|gre&s;&s;ed to the Vulgar;
I cannot forget Dr. <HI>Ow&mdash;ns,</HI> whom, at the End of my Fir&s;t
Volume, I promi&s;ed to record, and &s;corn to deal in Lyes, as he did. This
pious Divine, who was an intimate Ac|quaintance of my Father's, gave him&s;elf
the Trouble of coming to my Landlord, Mr. <HI>R&mdash;ly,</HI> an Officer of
Mace, in <HI>Mi|chael's-Lane,</HI> a little while after I was parted from my
Hu&s;band, together with his Curate, Mr. <HI>R&mdash;b&mdash;n&s;&mdash;n,</HI>
and, with great Humanity, in&s;i&s;ted on his turning me out of the Hou&s;e,
otherwi&s;e they would pre&s;ent it: Tne Landlord a&s;ked, what I had done?
They an&s;wered, I was an ex|communicated Per&s;on,&mdash;(a Lye;) that I had
run away from my Hu&s;band, (another Lye;)&mdash;that &s;ince I had left him, I
had &s;even Ba&s;tards,&mdash;which was pretty quick, as we had been but
&s;even Months a&s;under,&mdash;<PB N="77" REF="84"> (another Lye;)&mdash;but
when a Churchman is in for it, he will out-lye the Devil; at length, the&s;e
Par&s;ons de&s;cended &s;o low, as to threaten to inform, that my Landlord's
Wife was a <HI>Roman,</HI> which I believe, was another Lye; but, whether true,
or fal&s;e, it was very unbecoming their Characters, either as Gentlemen, or
Chri&s;tians, to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But I was to be in&s;ulted at any Rate; for the Clergy hang
together; and if &s;ome did, it would be no great Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>For when a &s;winging Sin is to be com|mitted, there is nothing
like a Gown and a Ca&s;&s;ock to cover it.</P>
<P>But once more to return to <HI>Albion.</HI> I had laid out a
Couple of Guineas on a little curious Picture, which I bought to &s;ell again,
but was advi&s;ed to pre&s;ent it to the Lord Almoner, who, they &s;aid, had a
Ta&s;te for Painting? He generou&s;ly ac|ceepted of my Favour, but neither made
me any Return from his own Bounty, nor his Maje&s;ty's; &s;o I had no great
Rea&s;on to &s;ay, he de&s;erved the Character of an hone&s;t Man.</P>

de&s;ired I might come and breakfa&s;t with him next Morn|ing, and begin.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I waited on him, and wonderfully was he delighted
with my Account of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>; he had the Patience to li&s;ten to me
three Hours, without ever once interrupting me; a mo&s;t uncommon In&s;tance of
good Breeding, e&s;|pecially from a Per&s;on of his Years, who 
<PB N="85" REF="92"> u&s;ually dictate to the Company, and en|gro&s;s all the
Talk to them&s;elves: For, as Dr. <HI>Young</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q> 
<L>A Dearth of Words a Woman need not fear;</L> 
<L>But 'tis a Ta&s;k, indeed, to learn to hear!</L> 
<L>In that the Skill of Conver&s;ation lies,</L> 
<L>'Tis that mu&s;t prove you both polite and wi&s;e.</L></Q> And
I do a&s;&s;ure my Readers, the Gentle|man neither yawned, &s;cratched his
Head, beat Tatoo with his Foot, nor u&s;ed any &s;uch ambiguous Giving-out, to
note that he was weary.</P>
<P>So far from it, that tho' he was engaged to dine with the Duke of
<HI>Gr&mdash;ft&mdash;n,</HI> he had forgot it, 'till his Ser|vant came in, to
dre&s;s him; he &s;trictly charged me to come to him the next Morning, and
&s;et my Spout a going, for &s;o he merrily called my Mouth.</P>
<P>I obeyed his mo&s;t kind Command; and, by way of Introduction,
told him a <PB N="86" REF="93"> Story Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> related to me, which
was as follows:</P>
<P>A Gentleman met a Friend in the Street, whom he had not &s;een for
&s;ome Years; he began to give him an Account of what had befallen him, &s;ince
their Se|paration from each other; a Care happened to intervene, upon which,
they took diffe|rent Streets; &s;even Years pa&s;t, and it &s;o befel, they met
ju&s;t in the &s;ame Place, when, without the lea&s;t Ceremony, he proceeded in
his Story, "And, as I was telling you, &s;aid he," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I was going to proceed, when Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> interrupted me. I
was, &s;aid he, at the Duke of <HI>R&mdash;chm&mdash;nd</HI>'s la&s;t. Sum|mer,
when his Daughter, a mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed young Lady, and a very early
Ri|&s;er, &s;at reading in a beautiful Portico, about Six in the Morning; I
acco&s;ted the fair Creature, and a&s;ked her the Subject of her Contemplation?
So in a mo&s;t ele|gant, and agreeable Stile, &s;he related to me Part of a
very entertaining Novel, &s;he held in her Hand, and, I believe, in bet|ter
Words than the Author wrote it. A <PB N="87" REF="94"> Summons to Breakfa&s;t
broke off her mo&s;t agreeable Narration.</P>
<P>The next Morning I &s;aw the Charmer in the &s;ame Portico, who
took up the Story at the very Word &s;he had broke off, and concluded it.</P>
<P>As <HI>Ireland</HI> is now graced with this illu&s;|trious Fair
One, in whom Virtue, Beauty, Mode&s;ty, Ta&s;te, and every Excellence unite, I
hope for her Pardon, for pre&s;u|ming to mention her.</P>
<P>And tho', as &s;he will &s;oon &s;ee her no|ble Father was a
beneficent Patron to me; I hate Flattery &s;o much, that I would not, on that
Account, pay her a Compliment beyond what was due to her elevated Sta|tion, did
not her &s;uperior Virtues command it.</P>
<P>Never yet were &s;een a more tender, or a more lovely Pair than
the Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> with their bloom|ing Progeny,
like new-blown Ro&s;es, &s;mi|ling around them; an In&s;tance, Wedlock may be
happy, even among the Great, when mutual Love, and mutual Honour join. 
<Q><PB N="88" REF="95"> 
<L>Here Love his golden Shafts employs, here lights</L> 
<L>His con&s;tant Lamp, and waves his pur|ple Wings;</L> 
<L>Reigns here, and revels!</L></Q></P>
<P>And, it is with infinite Plea&s;ure I learn, that Lord and Lady
<HI>Kildare</HI> are as great an Example in conjugal Fidelity, Piety, and
Genero&s;ity, as their noble Parents.</P>
<P>This Digre&s;&s;ion, I am certain, will be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I went on with my Story to Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who, at la&s;t, in
flowing Spirits, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Z&mdash;ds! write it out, ju&s;t as you re|late
it, and, I'll engage it will fell."</Q></P>
<P>Every Poem, as I occa&s;ionally introdu|ced them, he made me give
him a Copy of, and communicated them to the Earl of <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI>
who po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on it, that I mu&s;t under&s;tand <HI>Greek,</HI>
and <HI>Latin,</HI> otherwi&s;e I never could write <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o
well. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;aid, he had not enquired, but that he would that
Mo|ment: And, accordingly, came, and told <PB N="89" REF="96"> me, what my Lord
had &s;aid; I a&s;&s;ured him, I was ignorant of every Language, except my
Mother-tongue; but that if he would be &s;o kind to pre&s;ent my Re&s;pects to
his Lord&s;hip, and let him know, that Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> had taught me
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I was certain, he would allow, I had an excel|lent Tutor;
to which his Lord&s;hip readily acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>But, alas! though my Honours were very great, my Profits were very
&s;mall. The di&s;mal Return of Summer, for &s;o it was to me, robbed me of
every Friend; and, as I could not take up with mean Company, I was as
&s;olitary in <HI>London</HI> as the Pelican in the Wilderne&s;s. I acquainted
Dr. <HI>T&mdash;rnbull</HI> with my melancholy Situ|ation, and prevailed on him
to write to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> to remit to me what was due, on the
Agreement between us. About ten Days after, the Po&s;t-man brought a Letter,
marked from <HI>Dublin,</HI> to the Doctor; he happened to be at
<HI>Ken|&s;ington,</HI> &s;o I paid for it; and knowing he had no Acquaintance

Sub&s;cribers al&s;o, with full Power to do to them what he plea&s;ed: And,
truly Mr. Par&s;on, &s;o do I; but if nei|ther the Lord Lieutenant, nor any of
the principal Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction in this Kingdom, who have honoured me
with their Regard, &s;hould be willing to bear an In&s;ult from you, how can
you help your|&s;elf? Why, Man, we are in a Prote&s;tant Country, and di&s;dain
to be Prie&s;t-ridden.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf unable to pay &s;o high a Rent as I &s;tood at, I
di&s;charged my <PB N="96" REF="103"> Lodging and Servant, and went to board
and lodge at a very genteel Hou&s;e in <HI>Green-&s;treet,
Gro&s;venor-Square</HI>; my Land|lord was Valet de Chambre to the Earl of
<HI>Stair,</HI> and his Wife a top Laundre&s;s, which, in <HI>London,</HI> is a
very profitable Employment.</P>
<P>As &s;he wa&s;hed for &s;everal Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, &s;he
u&s;ed, on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> to in|vite the Head-Servants of Noblemen's
Fa|milies to Dinner, at which, I never took Umbrage; for you are &s;ure from
them to learn every Circum&s;tance relating to their Lords and Ladies; and many
entertaining Stories of their particular Humours and Gallantries, did I learn;
&s;o true is it, that either good or evil Fame proceeds from our Dome&s;tics;
and no Wonder, as they have a better Opportunity than the re&s;t of the World,
to watch our unguarded Hours, and comment on our Frailties.</P>
<P>Among&s;t others, Sir <HI>John Ligonier</HI>'s Gentleman, as they
&s;tiled him, which Name, his generous Ma&s;ter &s;oon after en|titled him to,
by giving him a Commi&s;|&s;ion, dined with us; he looked very at|tentively 
<PB N="97" REF="104"> at me, and put me into Confu|&s;ion, by telling my
Landlady, &s;he had, to his Knowledge, a Gentlewoman Lodger.</P>
<P>After Dinner, my Landlord brought in a large Bowl of Punch, Pipes
and Tobacco, upon which I made my <HI>Exit.</HI></P>
<P>I had not long been in my Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, which opened into a
very &s;weet Garden, when Mr. <HI>Parkin&s;on,</HI> for &s;o was this Per&s;on
called, followed me. He told me, he hated Drink and Tobacco, and would be
infinitely obliged to me for a Di&s;h of Tea, which, as my Curio&s;ity was
rai&s;ed by the Words he had let drop at Din|ner, I readily con&s;ented to give
him.</P>
<P>He had, he told me, frequently &s;een me in
<HI>Stephen's-Green,</HI> and was in <HI>Dublin</HI> at the Time of my
Separation from my Hu&s;band, and that Numbers of People la|mented my hard
Fate. I told him I had not found it &s;o, for that I could not even get what
was due to me from thence, nor an An&s;wer to any Letter I ever wrote.</P>
<P>He then a&s;ked me, how I got any Sup|port; e&s;pecially, as he
had learned from the Family, that I lived very retired; I in|genuou&s;ly 
<PB N="98" REF="105"> told him, I had no other For|tune than my Pen, and, at
his Reque&s;t, &s;hewed him &s;ome of my Writings; he told me his Ma&s;ter
delighted in Poetry, and was one of the mo&s;t generous Gentle|men living, and
that he was certain, if I applied to him, he would be a Friend to me: I was
ea&s;ily prevailed on to write to him, to beg he would do me the Honour of
&s;ub&s;cribing to me, and &s;ent him &s;uch of my Rhymes as I my&s;elf had the
be&s;t Opinion of. The General wrote me a very polite An&s;wer, and, as he
lived but a few Doors from my Lodging, gave me, the next Evening, the Honour of
a Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>This Gentleman is &s;o univer&s;ally known, beloved, honoured, and
e&s;teemed, that I dare not attempt his Character, being a&s;|&s;ured my be&s;t
Painting would fall infi|nitely &s;hort of the excellent Original. Nor was I at
all &s;urprized that he &s;hould be a Fa|vourite of the Fair, who was adorned
with Honour, Genero&s;ity, Valour, and yet even Female Softne&s;s, and
Complacency, added to the Charms of a mo&s;t graceful and maje&s;tic
Per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106">And if in an advanced Age he &s;hone &s;o
brightly, what mu&s;t he have done in his fir&s;t Bloom, when 
<Q> 
<L>His kindling Cheeks, with purple Beau|ties glow'd,</L> 
<L>His lovely &s;parkling Eyes &s;hot martial Fires;</L> 
<L>Dreadful as <HI>Mars,</HI> and as his <HI>Venus</HI>
charming.</L></Q> I dare &s;ay, half the Ladies would have cried out with
<HI>Phoedra.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>O God-like Form! O Exta&s;y, and Tran&s;|port!</L></Q></P>
<P>This worthy Gentleman &s;ub&s;cribed to me for Twelve Books, and
al&s;o engaged the late Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and &s;everal other <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Noblemen, to
do me the &s;ame Ho|nour.</P>
<P>So the Almighty rai&s;ed me Friends, even in a &s;trange Land; and
proved my Hu&s;band, tho' a Prie&s;t, no Prophet, who <PB N="100" REF="107">
declared I &s;hould &s;tarve; to which, indeed, his be&s;t Endeavours have not
been wanting.</P>
<P>But, he &s;hould have remembered the Words of holy <HI>David: I
have been young, and now am old, yet never &s;aw I the Righ|teous Man
for&s;aken, nor his Seed begging their Bread.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Father had, by his many good Works, entailed a
Ble&s;&s;ing on my hone&s;t Endeavours; and as Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> u&s;ed to
&s;ay, when I wrote any thing that plea&s;ed him, 
<Q REND="inline">"The Gift of the great God to you, pre&s;erves
you;"</Q> which, as I never &s;old, nor pro&s;tituted it to unworthy Ends, I
humbly hope his Mercy will afford to me, as long as I have any Being.</P>
<P>This timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance enabled me not only to live, but to
pur&s;ue my writing, which no Per&s;on can ever do well, while their Minds are,
like <HI>Martha</HI>'s, troubled with many Things.</P>
<P>A few Days after this, a very genteel pretty Woman, took a Lodging
in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with me: She was with Child, and her Hu&s;band was, as
&s;he &s;aid, a Lawyer, and was gone the Circuit; &s;o <PB N="101" REF="108">
finding the City not agree with her, &s;he moved to better Air. As &s;he had
very good Furniture, my Landlady made no Scruple to accept of her without
farther Enquiry; and I was well plea&s;ed to think, I &s;hould have an
agreeable Companion.</P>
<P>Her Manner of Life greatly &s;urprized me; for, in two Months
Time, &s;he never once went abroad, nor did any human Creature come to vi&s;it
her.</P>
<P>At length, about two o'Clock one Morning, a Gentleman came, who,
&s;he &s;he &s;aid, was her Hu&s;band; &s;he let him in her&s;elf, and he left
her early in the Morning, &s;o that none of the Family &s;aw him; he repeated
his nocturnal Vi&s;its &s;eve|ral Times, after the &s;ame Manner, in the Dead
&s;till, and Middle of the Night, which appeared to me rather to wear the Face
of an Amour, than lawful Matri|mony.</P>
<P>At length, the Gentleman failed in his Attendance, and the Lady
&s;aid, he was gone into the Country. 
<Q><PB N="102" REF="109"> 
<L>The Nightly Knocking at the Door did cea&s;e,</L> 
<L>The noi&s;ele&s;s Hammer ru&s;ted there in Peace.</L></Q> Some
Weeks pa&s;t over without either a Me&s;&s;age, or a Letter, coming from the
&s;uppo&s;ed Hu&s;band, upon which &s;he fell into a deep Melancholy; which,
though &s;he &s;eemed to attribute to her Apprehen|&s;ion of the approaching
Hour, I could ea|&s;ily perceive had &s;ome more &s;ecret and latent
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>And as in my Life I had never &s;een a more retired, or mode&s;t
Per&s;on, I had the utmo&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion for her, and judged, if &s;he was
among the Number of the Unfor|tunate, &s;ome uncommon Villainy had been
practi&s;ed again&s;t her.</P>
<P>As we were very intimate, I frequently &s;urprized her in Tears;
and, at la&s;t, I ventured to beg her to acquaint me with the Cau&s;e of her
Affliction, a&s;&s;uring her, it was not an impertinent Female Curio&s;ity
which urged me on, but a real De&s;ire to <PB N="103" REF="110"> be
&s;erviceable to her, which, perhaps, by &s;ome Means or other, Providence
might point out.</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into Tears, and fondly em|bracing me, told me, &s;he
wanted a Friend to unbo&s;om her&s;elf to, and added, that if I would be her
Bedfellow that Night, &s;he would relate to me her unhappy Story.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hed for Night came, and my fair Friend kept her
Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I am, &s;aid &s;he, the Daughter of an emi|nent Merchant, who by
his extraordinary good Nature, in being Surety for others, ho&s;pitable Spirit,
and very great Lo&s;&s;es at Sea, was obliged to live in a more narrow
Compa&s;s than &s;uited the Genero&s;ity of his Mind; my Mother dying when I
was but twelve Years of Age, my Father made me Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e,
which he &s;aid would teach me to be an Oeconomi&s;t, and to know how to govern
one of my own. When I was about fourteen Years of Age, a wealthy Packer, a very
hand&s;ome Man, courted me; my Father ingenuou&s;ly told him, he could give him
but five hun|dred <PB N="104" REF="111"> Pounds, with which, if he was
&s;atis|fied, and, that I had no Objection to it, he &s;hould be very glad to
have him for a Son-in-law.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H&mdash;rn&mdash;l,</HI> for &s;o was he called,
a&s;&s;ured him he would gladly take me without a Portion, but my Father
in&s;i&s;ted on his Acceptance of it, as it would help to furni&s;h a
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whatever may be thought at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, the&s;e who
conver&s;e with the Traders of <HI>London,</HI> will find, they neither want
Sen&s;e nor Politene&s;s; and I liked Mr. <HI>H&mdash;l</HI> &s;o well, that I
was very glad of being &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>My Hu&s;band took a Hou&s;e commo|dious for his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
for four Years, during which Time I had four Children, we lived in great
Harmony.</P>
<P>But, in the mean Time, I had the Mi&s;|fortune of lo&s;ing my dear
Father, who le&s;t the little Remainder of his Fortune, as a Portion for my
younger Si&s;ter, and ap|pointed my Hu&s;band to be her Guardian.</P>
<P>One Day he told me, he was afraid he &s;hould not be able to keep
&s;uch good <PB N="105" REF="112"> Hours as he had done, being cho&s;en a
Member of the Philo&s;ophic Club; in which were many Gentlemen of
Di&s;tinc|tion, who&s;e Acquaintance it was greatly his Intere&s;t to
cultivate, and to whom it was an Honour to be known, &s;o he hoped it would not
give me any Unea&s;ine&s;s: I an&s;wered, he had always been &s;o indulgent to
me, I mu&s;t be ungrateful, indeed, to take Offence, or be unea&s;y at any
thing he was plea&s;ed to do; he &s;eemed tran&s;|ported with my An&s;wer,
ki&s;&s;ed me, and &s;aid, I was the be&s;t Wife living. Little did I think
what Villainy he was perpetra|ting again&s;t me.</P>
<P>He now &s;tayed out &s;everal Nights en|tirely, and, if he came at
all, it was not 'till Four or Five in the Morning, which, being unacquainted
with Jealou&s;y, gave me no other Concern, than the Fear that Irre|gularities
might prejudice his Health; but I have often been &s;urprized at his coming
Home &s;o &s;ober, and that he did not ap|pear drow&s;y, after &s;uch long
watching.</P>
<P>One Morning, in particular, he no &s;ooner entered, but he called
for his Ri|ding <PB N="106" REF="113"> Dre&s;s, and told me, he was going with
a Gentleman into the Country, for a few Days; &s;o giving me his Pur&s;e, in
which were forty Guineas, he de&s;ired I would carefully ob&s;erve his
Bu&s;ine&s;s, in which I was now a pretty good Proficient.</P>
<P>Three Months Time elap&s;ed, and, tho' I wrote to him, according
to his own Di|rection, I never received an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I was now filled with the mo&s;t gloomy Apprehen&s;ions; one Time
concluding he had been murdered; a thou&s;and Fears pre&s;ented them&s;elves to
my Imagination, 'till lo&s;t and bewildered, I could fix on nothing: My Friends
per&s;uaded me to ad|verti&s;e him, which accordingly I did.</P>
<P>Some Days after, a very well dre&s;t young Gentleman de&s;ired to
&s;ee me; I &s;hewed him into the Parlour, where he demanded of me, whether I
was Mr. <HI>H&mdash;l</HI>'s Wife? I &s;aid, yes; upon which, to my great
Surprize, he a&s;ked me, could I prove it? I a&s;&s;ured him I could: 
<Q REND="inline">"That is all I want, Madam:"</Q> I begged he would
explain tho&s;e dark Speeches, ina&s;much as they quite terrified 
<PB N="107" REF="114"> me: 
<Q REND="inline">"Madam, &s;aid he, my Name is
<HI>L&mdash;ck&mdash;y,</HI> I have a good E&s;tate, and am newly called to the
Bar; your Hu&s;|band has inveigled away my Si&s;ter, and married her; &s;he is
under Age, and has fifteen thou&s;and Pounds to her Fortune; &s;he &s;hall
prove her Marriage; and, if you do not prove your prior one, what can the World
think of you?"</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at this Account, that I fainted
away;&mdash;the Gentleman called the Servants to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
&s;tayed by me 'till I came to my&s;elf; the Agonies I felt, are only known to
tho&s;e who have truly and tenderly loved: dread|ful Alternative! either to
pro&s;ecute a be|loved Hu&s;band to Death, or be my&s;elf deemed an infamous
Woman?</P>
<P>Here the poor Creature had &s;o renewed her own Angui&s;h, and
&s;o awakened all my Woes, that our Eyes &s;treamed &s;ocial, and mingled their
&s;ympathetic Waters; 'till, in&s;en&s;ibly, the dewy-feathered Sleep clo&s;ed
up our Eye-lids.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115">I longed as much for the next Night, as the
<HI>Sultan,</HI> in <HI>The Arabian Nights En|tertainment,</HI> did to hear the
charming <HI>Sche|razade</HI>'s fine Stories; at length it came, and the Lady
proceeded.</P>
<P>I begged a Day or two to con&s;ider on &s;o important an Affair,
and al&s;o to con|&s;ult with my Friends, what was mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable for me
to do, and then I would return a po&s;itive An&s;wer; &s;o, having an Uncle in
<HI>Bond-&s;treet,</HI> I &s;ent my Hou&s;hold Furniture there: Dear Madam,
&s;aid I, what did you do with your Children? Oh, returned &s;he, I never had
one that lived above a few Days. That, &s;aid I, was happy. I think &s;o now,
&s;aid &s;he, though I did not then. I told my Uncle all my mournful Story, who
advi&s;ed me, bv all Means, to vindicate my&s;elf, and not fall a Prey to &s;o
con&s;ummate a Villain.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed with my Uncle, who was a Widower; my Si&s;ter married,
and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;</HI> would not pay her her For|tune, as &s;he had not
a&s;ked his Con&s;ent: <PB N="109" REF="116"> My Uncle would not permit either
a Let|ter, or a Me&s;&s;age to be delivered to me, but kept me a perfect
Pri&s;oner; how|ever, there was a young Lady in the Neighbourhood, whom he had
&s;ome In|clination to marry, and whom he fre|quently brought, as a Companion,
to re|lieve my &s;olitary Hours.</P>
<P>One Evening &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my coming to drink Tea with her,
my Uncle urged me to it; I went. Judge of my Surprize! when I found there my
Hu&s;band's Mother and Si&s;ter all drowned in Tears; they told me, he was
confined in <HI>Newgate,</HI>&mdash;had taken the Pri&s;on-Fever, and declared
he could not die in Peace, unle&s;s he &s;aw me.</P>
<P>I loved too well to refu&s;e his Reque&s;t, upon which they
immediately hurried me into a Coach; and there indeed he was; the Lawyer had
arraigned him for his Life, and he mu&s;t take his Trial.</P>
<P>He looked &s;o dejected, and &s;eemed &s;o &s;incerely penitent,
and I, alas! &s;o &s;incerely loved him, that I even con&s;ented to &s;tay with
him in his Confinement; he acknow|ledged <PB N="110" REF="117"> his Fault; but
very artfully in&s;inu|ated, that it did not proceed from any Change in his
Affection, but that his Cir|cum&s;tances were &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that he
had no other Means to retrieve them; that his Death could be of no Service to
me;&mdash;that I knew my&s;elf to be his lawful Wife; that he would always
&s;upport me; in &s;hort, he u&s;ed every tender and prevailing Argument to
keep me from appearing again&s;t him, and, Heaven knows, I had no Inclination
to do it.</P>
<P>When his Trial-Day came, his &s;econd Wife fully proved her
Marriage to him; but, like the real Mother, I cho&s;e to give her all, &s;ooner
than divide him, &s;o &s;he triumphed over me; and, as I had given up the
Cau&s;e, none of my Friends would give me any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I am now in the
odde&s;t Situation imaginable; even a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s to my own Hu&s;band;
for, upon no other Terms, would he give me any Relief; nor do I know whether to
&s;tile my&s;elf innocent or guilty for my Conde|&s;cen&s;ion to him.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">As my Tenderne&s;s for him made me appear in
a bad Light to the World, ever ready to cen&s;ure even our be&s;t Actions; I
dare not in my pre&s;ent Condition, let any Per&s;on, who knows me, &s;ee me,
le&s;t they &s;hould think of me wor&s;e than I de&s;erve&mdash;I have had no
Supply from him for a con&s;iderable Time; he has prohibited my writing to him
at his Hou&s;e; and now, dear Madam, advi&s;e me what to do.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o peculiarly un|happy in this poor
Creature's Fate, that it might puzzle a wi&s;er Head than mine to comply with
her Reque&s;t; I con&s;idered it every way without being able to form any
Scheme for her Relief.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he told me, he kept an Of|fice on
<HI>Ludgate-Hill,</HI> (where he was always to be found at Nine) in the
Morning, as his &s;econd Wife was too fine a Lady to bear one in the Hou&s;e;
&s;he imagined, if I could &s;ee him, I might work on his Compa&s;&s;ion; I
readily con&s;ented to do any thing which might be &s;erviceable to her, and
ri&s;ing early next Morning, &s;he <PB N="112" REF="119"> gave me a Letter to
him, which I pro|mi&s;ed not to deliver, but into his own Hand.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I &s;et out on my Emba&s;&s;y, and found the
Gentleman, &s;uch as &s;he had de&s;cribed him, a polite, hand&s;ome Man, of
above thirty Years of Age; he was alone, and received me very civilly: I
pre&s;ented the Letter, but &s;eemed ignorant of the Contents; I could ea&s;ily
perceive he was much di&s;turbed; however, with a marvellous A&s;&s;urance, he
&s;aid, he could not give Charity to every Body; that he had often
a&s;&s;i&s;ted that unfortunate Per&s;on; that &s;he ought to work for her
Bread, as many of her Betters did, and a Number of &s;uch inhuman Speeches,
common on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions. I told him her pre&s;ent Condi|tions did not
enable her to perform any but Needle-work, and that he who put her into it
&s;hould &s;upport her; he a&s;ked me what I meant? Nothing but Honesty; if a
Man gets a Child he ought to take care of it. What, &s;aid he, would you have
me father a Ba&s;tard? She could not, <PB N="113" REF="120"> I am &s;ure, have
One by you; and would not, I am convinced, have One by any Body el&s;e. He bade
me explain my&s;elf; I told him, he perfectly under&s;tood me, and therefore it
was not nece&s;&s;ary; but that if he plea&s;ed, I would tell Mrs.
<HI>H&mdash;l</HI> the &s;econd, of his Midnight Vi&s;its to his Wife. The
Wretch &s;eemed confounded, and &s;eeing I knew him &s;o well, thought he had
be&s;t be quiet, e&s;pecially as a Gen|tleman came in, before whom he did not
care to be expo&s;ed; &s;o he called me to the Stairca&s;e, and putting a
Couple of Guineas into my Hand, &s;aid aloud, Madam, I &s;hall take care, and
mind your Directions; I begged he would, and &s;o we parted: But, I am well
convinced, it was Fear, not Love, that made him &s;end her even that
Trifle.</P>
<P>This unhappy Lady died a few Hours after &s;he was brought to Bed,
the Infant al&s;o died; and I hope, though her Hu&s;|band, by her Lenity, once
e&s;caped a Hal|ter, ju&s;tly due to him, he has, by this Time, inherited it,
for I would have &s;uch Offenders &s;o cut off.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121">I grew &s;o melancholy at the Lo&s;s of my
Companion, that I did not even care for writing, but amu&s;ed my&s;elf entirely
with reading; and my not having a Li|brary of my own, made me a con&s;tant
Cu&s;tomer to a Shop in the Neighbour|hood, where they hired out Books by the
Quarter; this brought me into an Ac|quaintance with the Per&s;ons who kept it,
&s;en&s;ible, well-bred People: One Day I received a Letter from Mrs.
<HI>Ryves,</HI> for that was their Name, that &s;he had &s;ome very agreeable
Friends with her, and that they wanted a Hand at Quadrille, &s;o &s;he hoped I
would be of their Party; I was very glad of any Recreation, and as they lived
but in <HI>Brook-Street,</HI> directly went. I was &s;hewn into a Parlour,
where &s;at an old Man, whom I knew to be a <HI>Grub-Street</HI> Writer, and a
young Gentleman in a very plain Dre&s;s, whom I al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be in
the &s;ame Cla&s;s; they were playing Crib|bage for a Farthing a Game, and,
in&s;tead of Counters, &s;cored with Chalk; they had al&s;o an Ale-hou&s;e Pot,
with &s;ome Porter <PB N="115" REF="122"> in it, &s;tanding by them, and the
Room &s;melled &s;trong of Tobacco; from the&s;e Appearances, I conceived a
very con|temptible Opinion of the Company, and would have retired, had I known
how to do it civilly; but, as at my Entrance, I had told Mrs. <HI>Ryves,</HI> I
was entirely di&s;|engaged that Evening, I could by no means get off; and could
only hope for &s;ome little Amu&s;ement, by hearing what tho&s;e Underlings in
Arts and Sciences might have to &s;ay; 
<Q> 
<L>For ev'ry Object of Creation</L> 
<L>May furni&s;h Hints for Contemplation.</L></Q> The Scene,
however, was changed, the di&s;agreeable Part of the Decoration re|moved, and a
Quadrille Table introduced.</P>
<P>The younger Gentleman propo&s;ed our playing for Nothing: 
<Q REND="inline">"P&s;haw, &s;aid I, then we &s;hall all
cheat;"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I would no more do that, &s;aid he, than give a
Vote again&s;t my Country."</Q>&mdash;This &s;urpri|zed me; told him, I hoped,
as he ex|pressed &s;uch a Spirit of Patrioti&s;m, he had <PB N="116" REF="123">
a Seat in the Hou&s;e: He &s;aid, he had the Honour of repre&s;enting the
ancient City of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; that his Father was Ad|miral
<HI>Rocke,</HI> and that he was married to the Si&s;ter of the Lord
<HI>Guilford Dudley,</HI> a Lady unmatched in Wit, and Beauty: I told him, I
was glad to find one Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, who was not a&s;hamed to do
Ju&s;tice to the Merits of his Lady: 
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould be a Scoundrel, &s;aid he to refu&s;e

Friends had de&s;tined her; an Obligation never to be forgot by a grateful
Spirit."</Q> This Gentleman had &s;uch an uncommon generous way of think|ing,
that, in&s;tead of minding the Game, I was quite attentive to him, which he
ob|&s;erving, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Take away the Cards, they are only fit to amu&s;e

<P>I was very glad of this;&mdash;the old Scrib|bler walked into the

and Mrs. <HI>Ryves</HI> went to get us &s;ome Chat-in&s;piring Liquor, Green
Tea.</P>
<P>I told Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> if I had been any way wanting in
Re&s;pect to him, I hoped he would attribute it to my Ignorance of his Station,
and the Company, and Situa|tion I found him in.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured me, I had committed no Offence, nor did he believe
it was in my Nature: But, &s;aid he, as you have re|marked on the Company, you
mu&s;t know my Wife and Lord <HI>S&mdash;thw&mdash;ll</HI>'s Si&s;ters went
this Morning to <HI>Greenwich:</HI> I had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s which prevented
my waiting on them; when that was over, I went to <HI>Mount-Street
Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> in order to pick up &s;ome Company to dine with me, and
finding none, I a&s;ked the old Man, who refu&s;ed me, as Mrs. <HI>Ryves</HI>
had engaged him; I told him, I would go dine with him;&mdash;as I had, in the
Shop, read your Apology for the Mini&s;ter, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to hear
it was the Product of a Lady's Pen; when I &s;eemed to que&s;tion 
<PB N="118" REF="125"> it, they propo&s;ed &s;ending for you, which being very
agreeable to me, was imme|diately done; &s;o, Madam, this is the Hi&s;|tory of
the Day.</P>
<P>I thanked the Gentleman, for his Com|plai&s;ance in relating
it.</P>
<P>The Tea put him into &s;uch high Spirits, that he, finding me a
Sort of a Politician, told me many entertaining Stories about Sir
<HI>Rob&mdash;t W&mdash;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s
various Schemes to have always the Majority of the Hou&s;e on his Side; of
which, as many as I can re|collect that were humorous, I pre&s;ent my Readers
with.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t was this: One Sir <HI>Cl&mdash;dy
M&mdash;cd&mdash;l,</HI> a <HI>Scots</HI> Baronet, without a Foot of E&s;tate,
was returned duly elected, for what Shire I have forgot; however, he came to
<HI>London,</HI> took a Hackney-Coach, and drove to Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI>'s;
the Servants &s;aid, he was engaged; but Sir <HI>Cl&mdash;dy</HI> in&s;i&s;ted
on his carrying up his Name, and, le&s;t he &s;hould forget it, he jumped out
of the Coach, and, running up Stairs after him, delivered his Emba&s;&s;y 
<PB N="119" REF="126"> him&s;elf. Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI> welcomed him, and,
like a Courtier, told him, he &s;hould be glad to &s;erve him: 
<Q REND="inline">"Nay, nay, Mon, returned he, I came na here for
Com|pliments; I ha ne Siller to get a Lodg|ing, &s;o I'll e'en &s;tay here till
you give me &s;ome:"</Q> So Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI> cho&s;e to give him his
Pur&s;e, rather than be plagued with his Impertinence.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>P&mdash;rb&mdash;h,</HI> a Pen|&s;ioner, told Sir
<HI>Rob&mdash;t,</HI> he was always at a Lo&s;s how to vote, ina&s;much as he
did not under&s;tand the Debates,&mdash;and was &s;o near &s;ighted, that when
the Hou&s;e divided, he knew not of which Side to go:&mdash;Sir
<HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI> bade him always follow the Bi|&s;hops. It happened, on the
Convention Scheme, three or four of the Bi&s;hops ro&s;e, and the Earl &s;eeing
them move, he, ac|cording to his Ma&s;ter's Direction, followed them, and voted
point-blank again&s;t his his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> &s;eeing how much I was plea&s;ed,
proceeded:</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="127">A <HI>Scots</HI> Peer, who was al&s;o a
Pen|&s;ioner, and a remarkable fat Man, came one Morning, according to
Cu&s;tom, to Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI>'s Levee, and, without the lea&s;t
Ceremony, laid hold of his Ribbon; Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t</HI> could not readily
di&s;engage him|&s;elf, and the Nobleman lugged him to the Window, in which,
&s;ou&s;ing him|&s;elf down, he happened to have an E&s;cape, which carried
with it &s;o loud a Report, that it threw the whole Company into Laughter.</P>
<P>Very well, my Lord, &s;aid the Mini&s;ter, pray what have you
farther to &s;ay?</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, this it is, Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t,</HI> I owe
Fifteen Hundred Pounds, and by G&mdash;d, if you don't give it to me, I'll go
to|morrow to the Hou&s;e, and vote ac|cording to Con&s;cience."</Q> 'Tis to be
pre&s;umed his Demand was complied with in private, though laughed at in
public, as he always voted with Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rocke</HI> finding me attentive, pro|ceeded: The late Duke

<HI>Ch&mdash;ch&mdash;ll</HI>'s lying with his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fe.</P>
<P>As I had never heard the Story, I beg|ged he would relate it: Why,
&s;aid he Sir <HI>R-b-rt</HI> went out very early one Morning to the Hou&s;e,
but having forgot &s;ome Paper of Importance to the dirty Work of the
Day,&mdash;he returned Home for it, and pa&s;&s;ing through his Wife's
Apartment to his Clo&s;et, what &s;hould he &s;ee, but his &s;erene Spou&s;e

jumped out of Bed, and be&s;ought Mercy, from, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, his

<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> &s;eeing me &s;o well diverted with this

<HI>Wh&mdash;rt&mdash;n,</HI>&mdash;you are to know, he had an Intrigue with
Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;,</HI> now C&mdash;te&s;s of <HI>B&mdash;</HI>; one Morning,
as they were in Bed together, he recollected that he had promi&s;ed to write a
Letter to a Friend&mdash;&s;o he called for a Pen, Ink, and Paper; but being at
a Lo&s;s for a Writing-De&s;k, made the Lady turn up her Po&s;te&mdash;s, and
dated his Letter from &s;weet <HI>P&mdash;ggy P&mdash;lt&mdash;y</HI>'s

<P>Here entered our kind Ho&s;t, and brought us in a Paper called the
<HI>Champion,</HI> in which was a very humorous Piece of Advice to all who went
to C&mdash;t, to wear Shields on their Bu&mdash;s; this was &s;o <HI>Mal</HI> 
<PB N="124" REF="131"> <HI>&agrave; propos</HI> that it rai&s;ed out Mirth:
Said Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> his M&mdash;'s own was in Dan|ger the other Night; As
how, Sir? Why, &s;aid he, Sir <HI>Rob&mdash;t,</HI> not chu&s;ing to hurt the
Kingdom by the K&mdash;'s u&s;ing foreign Commodities, when we had &s;o much
cheaper and better at Home, recom|mended to him Mi&s;s
<HI>Sk&mdash;rr&mdash;t,</HI> as an Hand-Maiden; his M&mdash; liked her &s;o
well, that he invited her to &s;up with him in the C&mdash;te&s;s of
<HI>Y&mdash;h</HI>'s Apart|ment, where growing a little more fond of his young
Mi&s;tre&s;s than the old One could bear, &s;he aro&s;e, and as the K&mdash;
leaned over the Table, drew the Chair from under him, and let M&mdash; come
&s;ou&s;e to the Ground: Oh, what a Falling-off was there! He, all enraged,
ro&s;e again, kicked fir&s;t the C&mdash;&s;s, next his Hat, and retired to his
Apartment, marvelou&s;ly di&s;tempered with Choler.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;urely Sir <HI>R&mdash;t</HI> was a mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary Servant, that would even Sir <HI>Pandarus</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI>

&s;u&s;pect a Man of his Reverence and Station, for the mo&s;t vile and
&s;ervile of all Employments!</P>
<P>Oh &s;y, &s;aid he, don't di&s;grace &s;o noble an Occupation. I
a&s;&s;ure you, the Knight's Complai&s;ance to the General proved the Means of
&s;aving his own Life; for, on the Exci&s;e Scheme, the People were &s;o
incen&s;ed, that they determined to put him to Death, and yet make it &s;eem
Chance Medley: Accordingly, as he was going down to St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s
<HI>Steps,</HI> into our il|lu&s;trious S&mdash;te-Hou&s;e! one Man pu&s;hed
him &s;o hard that he tumbled on his Face, and a Number of Per&s;ons determined
to run over him, and trample him to Death; but the General, who was with him,
drew his Sword, and &s;wore the fir&s;t who ad|vanced &s;hould die on Point of
<HI>Fox.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133">No body ventured to encounter a

<P>Ah! &s;aid I, that was God's Mercy, and ten Thou&s;and Pities!
Faith, &s;aid he, and &s;o it was.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rooke</HI> now began to be a little in|qui&s;itive, who I

<P>I do this to convince him I &s;corn to rob any of his

Proverb, '<HI>Tis but proper to &s;et the Saddle on the right Hor&s;e,</HI> or

<P>But to return.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">Mr. <HI>Rooke</HI> a&s;ked me, if I was

<P>I told Mr. <HI>Rooke,</HI> I was going to pub|li&s;h a Book by

<P>I never was more &s;hocked than at his untimely Fate; Heavens! all

<P><PB N="133" REF="140">I have ob&s;erved, if my Life had any

me bled, and ordered me to go to Bed; I did not &s;ee him till next Morning, by

Children, but of what Kind I knew not, it was fled, like the Remembrance of a
Gue&s;t which tarrieth <PB N="135" REF="142"> but a Day. I might have as well
have endeavoured to find out the Path which the light Bird had with his Wings
beat in the buxom Air, or the Track of a Ship, when with it's crooked Keel, it
divides the briny Waves which immediately unite again; or &s;eize old
<HI>Time,</HI> and bid him bring me back one Moment pa&s;t, as hope to
recollect what, was for ever lo&s;t in Oblivion.</P>
<P>Indeed I have frequently had the&s;e &s;u|pernatural Sollicitings,
or a Kind of Indi|cation of whatever was to befal me before it happened: Nay,
what is more &s;urpri|zing, I have read a Hi&s;tory, to me quite new, and it
has occurred to me, that I my&s;elf had been &s;ome way principally concerned
in the mo&s;t material Tran&s;actions of it, tho' they were pa&s;t a thou&s;and
Years.</P>
<P>Had I lived in the Days of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> I believe I
&s;hould have been of his Opi|nion, and have imagined, 
<Q>

<L>And here and there th' unbody'd Spirit flies.</L></Q> 
<PB N="136" REF="143"> Nay, I &s;hould have been afraid to kill a Woodcock,
le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;inherit the Soul of my Grand-dame.</P>
<P>If my Reader thinks me whim&s;ical, let him judge by the
Event.</P>
<P>A Woman, (in who&s;e Garden I had once walked in <HI>Ireland)</HI>
the fir&s;t Day I was able to &s;it up, and very weak I was after &s;o long
Sickne&s;s, even while my kind Phy&s;ician was rubbing my Temples with
<HI>Hungary</HI> Water to recover me out of a fainting Fit, ru&s;hed into the
Room, and, without the lea&s;t Ceremony, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know what that Villain has done?"</Q> As I
neither knew her, nor who &s;he &s;poke of, I was quite &s;tartled, and a&s;ked
her, who &s;he talked about, or what &s;he meant? 
<Q REND="inline">"That Villain <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> &s;ays &s;he,
who has &s;old your two younger Children for Slaves to <HI>New York:</HI>"</Q>
This was &s;uch a mon&s;trous Crime I could &s;carce give any Credit to it;
for, even admit|ting what he had &s;o cruelly charged me with in Regard to his
Bed, was Truth, how had their helple&s;s Innocence offended 
<PB N="137" REF="144"> him? I ob&s;erved to the Doctor, my Ra|vings were
ominous, and portended &s;ome dire Calamity.</P>
<P>The Doctor, apprehending this Shock might make me relap&s;e,
begged of the Per&s;on who gave it, to retire; which, after &s;everal
A&s;&s;everations, that what &s;he &s;aid was Fact, as indeed it was, and that
&s;he had brought it out in that Manner to ha&s;te me, if po&s;&s;ible, to
prevent their un|happy Fate, &s;he did.</P>
<P>As the Doctor was not only a Man of excellent Under&s;tanding, but
al&s;o of great Humanity, I told him, as he had been &s;o kind to admini&s;ter
to the Health of my Body, he mu&s;t now, if po&s;&s;ible, admini&s;ter to a
Mind di&s;ea&s;ed; and as it was impo&s;|&s;ible for him to pre&s;cribe
Remedies with|out knowing the Di&s;temper, and it's Ori|ginal, I gave him my
Story in a few Words, and he advi&s;ed me to write to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the
Rulers, and Bi&s;hops, which I did that very Night; and, pro|videntially, the
Letters were delivered Time enough to prevent the Children being &s;old to
Slavery&mdash;the Affair was <PB N="138" REF="145"> enquired into, and Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> was obliged to refund to the Ma&s;ter of the Kid-Ship, the
Golden Earne&s;t he had received as the Price of the Innocent.</P>
<P>What to me was mo&s;t &s;urprizing, was, that Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Mother was one of the Contrivers of this infernal Plot;
Grand|mothers being u&s;ually more indulgent to their Grandchildren than even
their Mo|thers; but as &s;he who would have made a Prey of them is not long
&s;ince dead, even of the Di&s;ea&s;e that <HI>Herod, Peter the Cruel,</HI> and
other malignant Wretches fell by, I can only bid her adieu, and chari|tably
hope &s;he has e&s;caped the Judgment of the next World, as it fell on her in
this.</P>
<P>The&s;e Facts are &s;o publickly known, that for the Evidence of
them I could pro|duce even a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, were it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And yet, who that beheld this Man, clad in holy Ve&s;ture at the

could believe him capable of all Manner of Crimes;

<L>But the plain Devil, and di&s;&s;embling Looks</L>
<L>To back his Cau&s;e.</L>

his Back, and let the World, for once &s;ee what the In&s;ide of a wicked

<P>As I received no Account from <HI>Ireland,</HI> I knew not what to
think; &s;ometimes I flattered my&s;elf that the Woman had be|lied him; at
other Times, reflecting on his intolerable Barbarity to the poor Crea|tures,
whom Di&s;tre&s;s alone made me leave immured within his inho&s;pitable Walls,
too rough a Cradle for my pretty Ones! my very Heart died within me, and I am
as well a&s;&s;ured, as that I live, that it was not the Fear of God, but the
Fear of a Halter, hindered him from embruing his own Hands in their vital
Blood.</P>
<P>But, enough of the Wretch, who, if he can di&s;prove me, ought to
do it; he attributes his Silence to Contempt of me, but it is well known he
neither wants Wit, nor Words, nor Impudence to bring him off: It is &s;trong
Conviction, with Proof as full and evident as Day again&s;t him, ties up his
guilty Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="148">At length, I thought of writing to
<HI>W&mdash;r&s;&mdash;le,</HI> as I had learned he was in <HI>Dublin:</HI> He
wrote me Word, that the Children were all well; that he had given an
Apprentice-Fee with my Daughter to a Milliner, and had taken my younge&s;t Son
to him&s;elf; that old Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and my Mother were dead, and my
la&s;t Child, which, being but an Infant, I could not carry to <HI>London</HI>
with me; that he had got a famous o&s;&s;ified Man, and was going to carry him
to <HI>Paris</HI> for a Shew, to which Place he earne&s;tly invited me to
accompany him.</P>
<P>I hoped, by this Letter, that Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had been
wronged, with re|gard to the Children under his Care; and tho' &s;ome humane
Tears fell for the Lo&s;s of my Mother and my Child, yet, con|&s;idering how
de&s;olate they both were, I en|vied rather than deplored their Fate.</P>
<P>The Child, here mentioned, was that which Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>
di&s;claimed, and advi&s;ed me to leave upon the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>And now I do a&s;&s;ure my Readers I was al&s;o &s;incerely
&s;orry for the Death of old <PB N="142" REF="149"> Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI>
ina&s;much as he always treated me with a fatherly Tenderne&s;s, was
exce&s;&s;ively fond of my Children, was a Man of a great uncultivated Genius;
and, tho' I have mentioned his keeping an Alehou&s;e, I did not mean it in any
Di&s;|re&s;pect to his Memory; for he was the Son of a Gentleman, tho', by
various Mi&s;|fortunes, he was reduced to take up &s;o low an Occupation; but
nothing can be ju&s;tly deemed &s;candalous which is not di&s;hone&s;t. And, I
am well convinced, had he lived, he never would have con&s;ented to the
in|human Barbarity of his Son. 
<Q> 
<L>Adieu, and take thy Prai&s;e with thee to Heav'n!</L></Q></P>
<P>So many melancholy Incidents had be|fallen me in this &s;olitary
Place, that I de|termined to change my Lodging; and was recommended by a
Stationer's Wife to a &s;ingle Gentlewoman who kept a Milliner's Shop in
<HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI>; &s;he was a jolly likely Dame, of about Forty, very
gay; we liked each other &s;o well, that we &s;oon <PB N="143" REF="150"> made
a Bargain, and, for a few Days, I was very well plea&s;ed with the Change, as
the Variety of that bu&s;y Part of <HI>London</HI> amu&s;ed my Mind: But I
&s;oon found that I was got into very bad Hands, and that my new Landlady was
neither better nor wor&s;e than a mercenary Town Jilt; who being pretty well
known her&s;elf, and con&s;equently de&s;pi&s;ed, wanted &s;omething new to
produce to her Cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>I think I never &s;aw any Per&s;on in my Life who did not
po&s;&s;e&s;s one good Quality, except this Creature; for Woman is a Term too
gentle for her, who had not even Decency to hide her Shame.</P>
<P>To give my Reader a Ta&s;te of her Cleanline&s;s: She told me
her&s;elf &s;he had not combed her Head for three Years, which, I believe, was
true, becau&s;e &s;he was not Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Comb, except when &s;he made
free with mine, than which no|thing could be more offen&s;ive to me, &s;o that
her Hair, tho' naturally fine, being quite matted on a filthy Hair-cap,
&s;eemed to be a Compo&s;ition of raw Silk and Mo&s;s, &s;uch as I remember to

<P>I really, 'till I &s;aw this Wretch, ima|gined the Dean had only
mu&s;tered up all the dirty Ideas in the World in one Piece, on Purpo&s;e to
affront the Fair Sex, as he u&s;ed humorou&s;ly to &s;tile old Beggar-women,
and Cinder-Pickers.</P>
<P>This makes me digre&s;s to relate a Com|pliment of his to &s;ome
Ladies, who &s;upped with him, of which I had the Honour to be One: The Dean
was giving us an Ac|count of &s;ome Woman, who, he told us, was the
na&s;tie&s;t, filthie&s;t, mo&s;t &s;tinking old <PB N="145" REF="152">
B&mdash;ch that ever was yet &s;een, except the Company, Ladies! except the
Company! for that you know is but civil. We all bowed; could we do le&s;s?</P>
<P>From the Time I had the Misfortune of being her Tenant, &s;he
invited every Per&s;on &s;he had any Acquaintance with to &s;ee me, as tho' I
had been &s;ome outlandi&s;h Mon&s;ter, or wonderful Curio&s;ity. Among&s;t the
re&s;t, &s;he prevailed on the now L&mdash;d Ch&mdash;f J&mdash;&s;t&mdash;ce
<HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> then a Stu|dent in <HI>Grays-Inn,</HI> a fine Gentleman,
po|etically turned, and &s;omewhat too much upon the effeminate or delicate
Order to bear whatever was not quite refined, to venture into her Dining-Room,
where I &s;at &s;cribbling; I was for retiring, but that was not permitted: The
Gentleman, who was dre&s;&s;ed in black Velvet, and had the Air of a Per&s;on
of Di&s;tinction, &s;aid, he hoped as his Vi&s;it was intended entirely to me,
I would not be &s;o unkind as to refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I did not know how I was enti|tled to &s;uch an Honour;
but &s;ince he was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow it on me, I &s;hould with Gratitude
accept of it. My Ho&s;te&s;s, for <PB N="146" REF="153"> that Name, by her
Bulk, far above the common Size of Females, &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;erve,
prudently left the Stranger and I to our&s;elves, under Pretence that &s;he
mu&s;t at|tend her Shop. Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> &s;eeing my Table covered with
written Papers, told me, my Room re&s;embled that of a Law|yer, and a&s;ked me
Leave to read my Contemplations; to which I agreeing, he had the Complai&s;ance
to &s;eem entertained; when, to my un&s;peakable Confu&s;ion, the Brute
returned, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"What will you treat the Lady with?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Any thing &s;he chu&s;es,"</Q> returned he, and
&s;eemed as much confounded as I was: 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Madam, what do you like?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No|thing at pre&s;ent, Sir, but what I have
ordered, &s;ome Coffee;"</Q> as it was but Five o'Clock in the Afternoon, and
as the Gentleman was remarkable for Sobriety, he approved of my Ta&s;te: He
offered to pay for it; 
<Q REND="inline">"I told him, I did not &s;ell it, and that he
could not more highly ag|grieve me."</Q></P>
<P>My Landlady &s;ent it up, but did not think proper to partake of
our Repa&s;t, of <PB N="147" REF="154"> which I was very glad; he looked on me
with Eyes of great Compa&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially as he ob&s;erved the Tears
&s;pringing from mine, for indeed I was quite &s;hocked; he a&s;ked me how I
became acquainted with a Per&s;on &s;o very unlike my&s;elf? I told him, I was
a Stranger, and knew very little of her: as he gave Credit to my Words, he
advi&s;ed me to quit her Hou&s;e, a&s;&s;uring me &s;he was a Procure&s;s, and,
as he &s;aid, kept a Shop only to di&s;gui&s;e her real Occupation.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce fini&s;hed his friendly Cau|tion, when Madam
entered again with two very large Lob&s;ters in one Hand, and a Bottle of Wine
in the other, &s;he laid a very foul Table Cloth, dre&s;&s;ed her Fi&s;h, and
invited us to partake; which we refu&s;ing, &s;he eat them all her&s;elf, drank
the Bottle of Wine, and very mode&s;tly de&s;ired the Gentleman to pay for
them, to which he acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>This Scene made us laugh heartily, for &s;he fed with &s;uch keen
Di&s;patch, and drank &s;o often, that &s;he &s;eemed like a &s;tarved Pierot,
devouring all before her.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="155">Her Rage of Hunger being now, as we hoped,
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;he once more left us; and Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e</HI> &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"I hope you are now convinced, Madam, that, at
lea&s;t, your Reputation will be un|done, if you continue here:"</Q> I
an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">"It was but too true; but that, at pre|&s;ent, I
&s;aw no Method of Relief, as &s;he owed me Money, which &s;he never was
ba&s;hful in borrowing, by which means I was ill provided to remove, and had
agreed to take it out in Board and Lodging."</Q></P>
<P>Here Madam once more ru&s;hed in, when, to my great Surprize!
&s;he a&s;ked Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> would he give her a roa&s;ted Fowl and
Sau&s;ages for Supper? He told her, after &s;o plentiful a Meal as &s;he had
ju&s;t made, he was &s;ure &s;he did but je&s;t: She affirmed &s;he was in
earne&s;t, and that if he would not, there was a Gentleman below that
would.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> who had a Mind to hold more Talk with me,
a&s;ked me, what Part of the Hou&s;e belonged to me? She an&s;wered, with
matchle&s;s Impudence, a <PB N="149" REF="156"> very good Bed-chamber, which
&s;he &s;up|po&s;ed, we &s;hould have no Objection to, as we liked each other
&s;o well.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed not to take the Meaning of her Speech; and not having
the lea&s;t Appre|hen&s;ion of any Incivility being offered to me by a Per&s;on
of good Breeding, and Humanity; I told the Gentleman, he &s;hould be very
welcome, if he plea&s;ed to walk into it,&mdash;as it was on the &s;ame Floor;
he &s;aid, I did him great Honour, and that he would wait on me.</P>
<P>However, to avoid the evil Comments which wicked Per&s;ons,
judging others by them&s;elves, are ever ready to make, I left the Door wide
open, to the no &s;mall Mor|tification of my Landlady, and her new Gue&s;t, as
they were obliged to pa&s;s by it.</P>
<P>And what &s;hould he be but &s;ome drunken Swabber or Boat&s;wain!
who&s;e Tarpaulin Compliments, of which we heard every Word di&s;tinctly, for
&s;ome time, diverted us; 'till, at la&s;t, their Talk became &s;o
of|fen&s;ive, that as I had left the Door open in Point of Decency, I was now
on the &s;ame Account obliged to &s;hut it.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="157">The Gentleman once more urged the
Nece&s;&s;ity of my Departure from this vil|lainous Woman; a&s;&s;uring me, if
I would but change my Lodging, and &s;end a Line to him, with a Direction,
where to find me, he would do every thing in his Power to &s;erve
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Merit, as he was plea&s;e to term it.</P>
<P>And that nothing might be wanting to enable me to do it, he, in a
very polite Manner, obliged me to accept of two Guineas, as a Sub&s;cription to
my Wri|tings.</P>
<P>This ingenious Gentleman entertained me with the Recital of
&s;everal beautiful poetical Compo&s;itions of his own, and finding I was not
quite ta&s;tele&s;s, but, at lea&s;t, endeavoured to give them due Prai&s;e, he
&s;tayed with me 'till Ten o'Clock, no un&s;ea&s;onable Hour, as it was in the
Month of <HI>June</HI>; when, either being hungry him&s;elf, or willing to
entertain me, he in&s;i&s;ted on my Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end to the <HI>Devil
Tavern</HI> for &s;ome Supper, a Meal I never chu&s;e, but, in Complai&s;ance
to my Benefactor, and al&s;o as a Means of en|gaging <PB N="151" REF="158"> his
further Conver&s;ation, which was truly elegant, I, with &s;ome Reluc|tance,
&s;ubmitted to. Our one Maid be|ing gone for the other Bowl of Punch for the
Sailor, the Gentleman went and be|&s;poke it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could not, in his Ab&s;ence, but reflect how much the unhappy
Part of Women di&s;appoint even their own Ends; for when they throw off the
Appearance of Mode&s;ty, and &s;hew the mercenary Pro&s;ti|tute unveiled, no
Man of common Under|&s;tanding can have the lea&s;t Regard for them; Mr.
<HI>Addi&s;on</HI> ob&s;erves of &s;ome Wo|man, who kept a noted Hou&s;e of

<L>On ev'ry Thorn delightful Wi&s;dom grows,</L> 
<L>In ev'ry Rill a &s;weet In&s;truction flows.</L></Q> How happy
&s;hould I think my&s;elf!</P>
<P>My Readers will, I hope, acknow|ledge I deal candidly with them,
when I not only acquaint them with my Actions, but reveal to them even the
inmo&s;t Re|ce&s;&s;es of my Soul as freely as to Heaven.</P>
<P>At length, remembering that Nature requires a Time of Re&s;t, I
thought it but meet to indulge the plea&s;ing Heavi|ne&s;s: or, in plainer
Language, I went to Bed, and enjoyed the Honey-dew of Sleep, 'till it was very
late in the Day.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Maid had, on purpo&s;e to mortify her Mi&s;tre&s;s,
told her how genteely Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e</HI> had entertained me; which, though
&s;he her&s;elf had been guilty of &s;uch foul Intemperance, and &s;wini&s;h
Gluttony, rai&s;ed her Indignation to &s;uch a Height, <PB N="156" REF="163">
that &s;he downright affronted me, telling me, I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s with her
Gallant: Why, &s;aid I, &s;ure you had him all to your|&s;elf, I did not
interfere; for I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he meant hone&s;t Tar, but, it &s;eems, I was
mi&s;taken, for it was Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> whom &s;he had &s;o politely
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and whom now &s;he had called a hundred Scrubs; a&s;|&s;uring
me, &s;he could never make any thing of him, and really I believed her; and by
what I then &s;aw of her Temper, I am certain, had &s;he known he had made me a
Pre&s;ent, I &s;hould not have e&s;caped with|out a good Beating.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, at la&s;t, I warrant I had a better Chap than
your fine Beau; (this was &s;peaking pretty plain) my Man gave me a Crown, and
Victuals, and Liquor enough: Now, be &s;incere, what did that Mr.
<HI>Maiden</HI> give you? For what, &s;aid I, I have nothing to &s;ell; you who
keep a Shop, and are in the way of Trade, may ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;e of five
Shillings Worth of Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="164">The Wretch knew not what An&s;wer to make to
me; to acknowledge her&s;elf a Pro&s;titute, as I did not &s;eem to think her
one, was too vile, even for her, and to have given but the mo&s;t remote Hint,
that &s;he &s;u&s;pected any evil Corre&s;pondence between Mr.
<HI>E&mdash;e</HI> and me, laid her ab&s;olutely at our Mercy.</P>
<P>However, &s;he turned off the Di&s;cour&s;e with what Mr.
<HI>Addi&s;on</HI> terms a Hor&s;e-Laugh, an excellent Expedient to &s;upply
the Lack of Brains, and which whoever can &s;ecure on their Side, are &s;ure of
Victory; for who can &s;tand it, let it be ever &s;o in|judiciou&s;ly
be&s;towed?</P>
<P>This I have very lately experienced, when one
<HI>W&mdash;dw&mdash;rd,</HI> a Player, got the Laugh again&s;t me, who never
vied with his &s;uperior Excellence, only by &s;aying, 
<Q> 
<L>What, &s;hall a Tumbler &s;et me thus adrift,</L> 
<L>I the Succe&s;&s;or of immortal <HI>Swift?</HI></L></Q> Oh
that his Words had been true! that he had bequeathed to me the precious Legacy
of his Wit and Learning 
<Q><PB N="158" REF="165"> 
<L>Or that, when all &s;ublim'd, he ro&s;e to Heaven,</L> 
<L>I had inherited his &s;acred Mantle;</L> 
<L>Then mid&s;t the Prophets might I, in Strains</L> 
<L>Such as delight the Ear of God, pour forth Unfetter'd
Harmony.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to de&s;cend to this terrene Spot: I dre&s;t, and wandered
forth in que&s;t of a new Lodging; not well knowing this Part of the Town, I
pa&s;t through a very clean Court, all inhabited by Jewellers, and ju&s;t
oppo&s;ite to the End of it &s;aw on the Window of what they in <HI>London</HI>
call a Twi&s;t Shop, a Bill up to let the fir&s;t Floor. The Woman of the
Hou&s;e &s;hewed me the Apartment; the Furniture was not only new but rich, and
I concluded the Price would be too high for me; but, to my great Surpri&s;e,
the Woman of the Hou&s;e agreed, not only to furni&s;h me with Linen, but
al&s;o with Plate and China for Five Shillings a Week; there was but one
In|convenience, which was, that there was no Pa&s;&s;age into the Hou&s;e, but
through the <PB N="159" REF="166"> Shop, to which, if they did not object, I
had no Cau&s;e. It &s;o fortuned that the Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s
Woman, whom I had known at the Laundre&s;s's before-men|tioned, came in, and
gave me &s;o high a Character, that we agreed on my taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of my new Apartment the next Day.</P>
<P>I went from this to a Friend's to Dinner, and did not return Home
till Ten at Night; but never in my Life was I more highly provoked; for lo! my
Land|lady and &s;ome Fellow or other were in my Bed; the Maid never apprized me
of it, being willing to expo&s;e her brutal Mi&s;|tre&s;s to the utmo&s;t, but
&s;hewed me into the Chamber.</P>
<P>I am certain, I was infinitely more a&s;hamed than &s;he was, for
&s;he called to me to &s;it down on the Bed &s;ide; but I ha&s;tened out, and,
as I could not take up with her Bed, I was obliged to &s;it up all Night.</P>
<P>Pretty &s;oon in the Morning, a Woman came to &s;ee me; &s;he and
I packed up my Clothes, called a Porter, and made him carry them to my new
Abode, and, as I <PB N="160" REF="167"> hoped never to &s;ee the Wretch again,
I did not bid her Adieu.</P>
<P>My Landlord was a Ma&s;ter-Taylor, in very good Circum&s;tances,
and his Wife a very &s;ober mode&s;t Woman.</P>
<P>I pa&s;t a Week over very calmly, when remembering my Promi&s;e to
Mr. <HI>E&mdash;e,</HI> I wrote a Line to him, but, as I did not know what
Street I was in, I enquired of my Landlady, who with very great Re|luctance,
told me, it was <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> I was extremely concerned at this Piece of
Information, which &s;he ob&s;erved, and, a&s;|&s;ured me, I might enquire into
her own, and her Hu&s;band's Character; that they had kept their Lodgings
empty, &s;ooner than let them to any idle Per&s;on, though they could have had
a good Price for them; and a great deal more to the &s;ame effect; all which,
though I did mo&s;t &s;ted|fa&s;tly believe, yet I held it no proper Place for
me, of all Per&s;ons in the World, to re&s;ide in.</P>
<P>Women who&s;e Characters are unble|mi&s;hed, or, who have their
Hu&s;bands <PB N="161" REF="168"> with them as Guardians to it, may do a
thou&s;and Things, which tho&s;e who have fallen on evil Days, and evil
Tongues, in Prudence mu&s;t avoid.</P>
<P>I did not directly tell my Landlady that I mu&s;t leave her, being
re&s;olved, if po&s;|&s;ible, not to remove till I could find a Place where I
could be fixed.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I once more took my Way to <HI>St. James</HI>'s, and
called upon my old Landlady there: Her fir&s;t Floor was let, but the &s;econd
being tolerably genteel, we, as we had always been on very friend-Terms, &s;oon
made a Bargain for it, and I was to enter on it as &s;oon as my Week for the
other was up. The very Air of <HI>St. James</HI>'s always plea&s;ed me, and
indeed I received &s;o many Favours from the Nobili|ty, that I had ju&s;t
Cau&s;e to prefer it to any other Part of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This happened to be &s;ome public Fe&s;ti|val, which, as I did not
recollect, I &s;at with the good old Gentlewoman till Even|ing, when on my
return Home, there was a large Bonfire, and a great Crowd at the 
<PB N="162" REF="169"> Temple-Gate; I &s;topped a little, being &s;tar|tled,
and not well knowing how to pa&s;s by, when an old Gentleman very well dre&s;t,
a&s;k|ed me where I was going? I told him, which was Truth, I had mi&s;taken my
Way, being a Stranger: He &s;aid, if I'd let him know where I lived, he would
wait on me Home; I was almo&s;t a&s;hamed to do it, yet, con&s;idering they
were creditable Peo|ple where I lodged, I ventured to inform him. My Landlord
happened to be his Taylor, &s;o he readily conducted me to his Hou&s;e; the
People &s;aluted him, and ask|ed him for his Lady and Family: Why, &s;aid he,
this is one of them, &s;he is a near Relation to my Wife. I was &s;urprized at
this new Kindred, and could not tell whether the old Gentleman &s;poke Truth or
not, though I could not recollect I had ever &s;een him be|fore: yet, as the
Landlord treated him with the highe&s;t Re&s;pect, I thought it not con|venient
to contradict him, &s;o I invited him in, and wondered where this would
end!</P>
<P>My Landlady lighted us up to my Din|ing-room; he told her, I had
dined at his <PB N="163" REF="170"> Hou&s;e, and that after &s;o long a Walk I
mu&s;t needs be dry, and therefore de&s;ired her to get him a Bottle of Wine,
and a Plate of <HI>Scotch</HI> Collops from &s;ome particular Tavern he
directed her to.</P>
<P>As I found the old Gentleman did not &s;tick at telling one Lye, I
concluded all he &s;aid was fal&s;e, as it really was.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner departed, but he a&s;ked me, whether he was not an
able Politician? I &s;aid, he was a merry Gentleman, and I hoped as I had the
Honour of being his Cou&s;in, he would let me know who he was, le&s;t I
&s;hould be asked any cro&s;s Que&s;tions, and our Accounts &s;hould vary.</P>
<P>He told me his Name, and where he lived; that he had a
con&s;iderable E&s;tate, and al&s;o a good Employment under the Government, all
of which did not make him happy, becau&s;e Heaven had not ble&s;&s;ed him with
a Child.</P>
<P>He then asked me who I was? for he &s;aid, he was &s;ure I had had
a good Edu|cation. As I had no rea&s;on to doubt of his Sincerity, I told him
my Story, with which he &s;eemed much affected; and in <PB N="164" REF="171">
Conclu&s;ion, I a&s;&s;ured him, I was more un|happy in having Children, from
whom, in all probability, I was for ever &s;eparated, than he could be, who
never had one.</P>
<P>Here my Landlady brought in Supper, to which he invited her to
&s;tay; our Con|ver&s;ation turned on general Topics; it grew pretty late, when
to my great A&s;toni&s;h|ment, the Gentleman &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Cou&s;in, I think you told me, you wanted Mo|ney,
I have a good deal of your's in my Hands, though not much about me at
pre&s;ent; however, here are a couple of Guineas, when you want Fifty you know
where to come."</Q> Would I did, thought I, but it was no time for me to
refu&s;e them.</P>
<P>When he went away, I knew not what to think of this odd Adventure,
&s;ometimes I fancied it was a Dream, and dreaded to wake le&s;t the Gold
&s;hould vani&s;h; then I began to flatter my&s;elf, that perhaps &s;ome
Relation had left me a Legacy; but hav|ing never &s;ince my Di&s;tre&s;s,
received the &s;malle&s;t Favour from one of them, I could hardly hope they
&s;hould now feel any com|punctuous <PB N="165" REF="172"> Vi&s;itings of
Nature, who were all to me, remor&s;ele&s;s as the Sea.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the more I thought, the more I was perplexed, and
could only humbly hope, that the protecting Hand of him who 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Doth the Raven feed,</L> 
<L>Yea, providentially catereth for the Spar|row,</L> 
<L>A&s;&s;i&s;ted me to live for &s;ome good End,</L> 
<L>Be&s;t to his Wi&s;dom known.</L></Q> So recommending my&s;elf
to his paternal Care, who had Compa&s;&s;ion on my Sor|rows, I went to my
Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Early next Morning the Woman of the Hou&s;e told me, there was a
Lady wait|ing for me in the Dining-room; &s;o I aro&s;e, and who &s;hould it
be, but my late odious Landlady!</P>
<P>My Reader may judge how welcome &s;he was. She told me there was a
Gentle|woman waiting for me at her Hou&s;e, who had Bu&s;ine&s;s of the
utmo&s;t Con&s;equence, and very much to my Advantage to im|part 
<PB N="166" REF="173"> to me: Though I &s;carce gave Credit to her, yet
Curio&s;ity made me accompany her Home, where I beheld a marvellous
ill-favoured old Woman; her Chin, which had on it a comely black Beard,
almo&s;t met her No&s;e, there not being a Tooth in the Way to bar their Union.
I am &s;ure, had <HI>Don Quixote</HI> &s;een her, he would have endeavoured to
di&s;enchant her Mu&s;tachio's. Her Eyes were black and fierce, her Back nobly
prominent, her Dre&s;s tawdry, and take her for all in all, I hope I never
&s;hall look upon her Like again. I was doubtful whether it was not a Man in
Woman's Clothes; but if it were a Crea|ture of the Feminine Gender, I concluded
it mu&s;t be a Witch, and that the Study of the Black Art had made her &s;o
hairy about the Face, that &s;he had need of a Barber. But to proceed: She
acco&s;ted me very ci|villy, in a deep <HI>Connaught</HI> Brogue, told me &s;he
knew all my good Family, and lived in the &s;ame Pari&s;h with me in
<HI>Dublin</HI>; I &s;oon grew tired of her ful&s;ome Flattery to me and them,
and de&s;ired to know her Commands; &s;he told me my Lord
<HI>G&mdash;l|w&mdash;y</HI> <PB N="167" REF="174"> had a great Regard for my
Fa|ther, and was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing me,&mdash;and would be a Friend to
me: and if I would dine with her next Day, he would meet me: I now began to
gue&s;s at my Lady's Occupation, and gave her a point blank Denial; not but
that I &s;hould have been glad to &s;ee his Lord&s;hip, as I knew he had a
Regard for my Father; but a Woman mu&s;t appear in a comtemptible Light, when
introduced to a Nobleman by one of the Devil's Agents. So I left Madam to her
Meditations, and departed, to her no &s;mall Di&s;comfort, for it was a gol|den
Guinea out of her Way; as it &s;eems, my Lord's Price was two, one of which he
pre&s;ented to Madam Procure&s;s, and the other to the Lady who granted him a
Fa|vour.</P>
<P>This infernal Emba&s;&s;adre&s;s had taken on her the Name of
<HI>Cunningham,</HI> being, as &s;he &s;aid, ruined by a Gentleman of that
Name, who had recommended her to &s;e|veral of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Noblemen,
as a very nece&s;&s;ary Per&s;on. Oh how dete&s;table it is 
<PB N="168" REF="175"> to feed a Maw, or clothe a Back by &s;uch a filthy
Vice!</P>
<P>Well, at the appointed Time, I re|turned to <HI>St. James</HI>'s,
and the fir&s;t Day I was there, I was honoured with a Letter from Lord
<HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y,</HI> as follows; 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought I had had the Honour of be|ing known to you, but
find I have been impo&s;ed upon; if you will permit me to pay my Re&s;pects to
you this Evening, I will unfold this My&s;tery to you, and am very
&s;incerely,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient Servant, G.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I returned my Compliments to his Lord|&s;hip, and gladly excepted
of the Honour of his Company.</P>
<P>About Six he came, and related to me the Trick Mrs.
<HI>Cunningham</HI> had put on <PB N="169" REF="176"> him; he told me, he had
employed her to find me out, having a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee a Per&s;on he had
&s;o often heard of, both at <HI>White</HI>'s and in <HI>Ireland</HI>; that the
Appoint|ment was made, and a Lady introduced to him, whom by his De&s;cription
of her, I knew to be the odious Mrs. <HI>Smith,</HI> my &s;hocking
Landlady;&mdash;he &s;aid he was much di&s;appointed when he &s;aw her, but the
Lady was very kind; nay, &s;o kind that he could not re&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>As you &s;tood at your Window this Morning, Colonel
<HI>D&mdash;ne&mdash;be</HI> a&s;ked me, knowing I was one of the
Commi&s;|&s;ioners of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whether I knew you? I an&s;wered,
no:&mdash;Why, &s;aid he, that is a little <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Mu&s;e, a
Phy&s;ician's Daugh|ter, and a Par&s;on's Wife, an eloped one I have been told,
but &s;he won't confe&s;s that; on this I a&s;ked your Name, the Colonel &s;aid
it was <HI>Pilkington,</HI> but you were u&s;ually called Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI>;
I then found I had been deceived, and wrote immediately to you.</P>
<P>I told his Lord&s;hip, I had the Honour of having many
Repre&s;entatives, which <PB N="170" REF="177"> had been of very great
Di&s;advantage to my Character, ina&s;much as they were pretty liberal of their
Favours, which were placed to my Account, though I knew nothing of the Matter:
My Lord &s;aid, that was hard; but he hoped, now he had found the real Mrs.
<HI>Pilkington,</HI> &s;he would not be inexorable. To turn off this Sort of
Di&s;|cour&s;e, I talked of public Affairs, which put my Lord in the Head of
making me pacquet Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Th&mdash;mp&s;&mdash;n,</HI> then
Candidate in the Election for the City of <HI>Y&mdash;rk,</HI> with old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rhymes, after the Manner of Mother <HI>Shipton</HI>'s
Pro|phecies, to inform him of the Defeat he was to meet with in that Year. I
had the good Fortune to divert him with my co|mical Stuff &s;o well, that he
left me a Task, which was to tran&s;late a <HI>French Chan&s;on &agrave;
boire</HI>; he gave me a couple of Guineas, and promi&s;ing to be a frequent
Vi&s;itor, he took his Leave.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure my Readers, I was very glad to be retained as his
Lord&s;hip's Mu&s;e and Secretary,&mdash;an Employment both of Honour and
Profit.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178">I continued in Favour &s;ome Time; and we
bantered half the Nobility, either about their Love-Intrigues or Parliamentary
Af|fairs, all of which were well known to his Lord&s;hip, who honoured me with
his Con|fidence and In&s;truction.</P>
<P>But as all Happine&s;s fades away, an un|fore&s;een Accident
bla&s;ted mine.</P>
<P>My Lord was &s;eized with a Fever, which confined him &s;ome Days;
the fir&s;t Time he was able to go Abroad, he wrote me Word he would pa&s;s the
Evening with me. About his appointed Hour, &s;omebody tapped at the Dining-room
Door, which I opened; when, in&s;tead of my Lord, en|tered Colonel
<HI>D&mdash;nc&mdash;be</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sp&mdash;nc&mdash;r,</HI> whom the
Colonel pre|&s;ented to me, and made his <HI>Exit.</HI></P>
<P>This Nobleman was no more like his Brother than I to
<HI>Hercules,</HI>&mdash;for the fir&s;t Thing he did was to double-lock the
Door, put the Key in his Pocket, and by main Strength oblige me to &s;it on his
Knee. I told him I expected Lord <HI>G&mdash;l|w&mdash;y,</HI> but that had no
Effect, for he &s;wore he &s;hould not have Admittance; he 
<PB N="172" REF="179"> &s;aid he was as well entitled to a Lady's Favour as any
Lord: It was to no Purpo&s;e for me to a&s;&s;ure him, my Lord never a&s;ked
any but what were con&s;i&s;tent with Ho|nour: He gave no Credit to my Words,
and &s;eeing he had &s;et me weeping, he &s;aid, my Lord was very happy in my
Love, but that he was not worthy of it, being an Incon&s;tant; but as for me,
added he, I do not come to pay you one Vi&s;it, but to make you mine for ever,
to rai&s;e &s;uch Me|rit above Di&s;tre&s;s, and to make you as happy as I
can.</P>
<P>Sir, returned I, your Goodne&s;s de&s;erves my Acknowledgment, but
your Meaning &s;eems doubtful; on what Terms am I to receive tho&s;e
Advantages? On the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;weete&s;t in the World, &s;aid he, give
me your Love in return, it is all I wi&s;h; and running on with Lord
<HI>Ha&s;tings</HI>'s Speech in his Midnight Vi&s;it to poor <HI>Jane
Shore,</HI> he cried, 
<Q> 
<L>Be kind, my charming Mi&s;tre&s;s, to my Wi&s;hes,</L> 
<L>And &s;atisfy my panting Heart with Beauty!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">It was in vain for me to remon&s;trate that
he had a fine young Lady of his own; that I was not worth the Pains he took;
that I was not hand&s;ome: He &s;aid, I plea&s;ed him, and that to him was
Beauty, which he was re&s;olutely determined to po&s;&s;e&s;s, if not by
Con&s;ent, he would make u&s;e of Force.</P>
<P>And truly the Gentleman would &s;oon have convinced me he was the
&s;tronger, had not Lord <HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y</HI> knocked at the Door; he
&s;wore I &s;hould not open it: My Lord called to me, and &s;aid he would break
the Door open. I begged of Mr. <HI>Sp&mdash;nc&mdash;r</HI> to permit me to let
him in, and that if he would &s;tay a Moment, I would frame &s;ome hand&s;ome
Excu&s;e to di&s;|mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>He gave me the Key and went into the Bed-chamber; I opened the
Door for Lord <HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y,</HI> who brought with him the Earl of
<HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x,</HI> a fine Gentleman; Lord <HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y</HI>
was either very angry, or affected to appear &s;o; and really I knew not what
Apology to <PB N="174" REF="181"> make, only to &s;ay I had been a&s;leep. The
Noblemen &s;eated them&s;elves, to the no &s;mall Vexation of Mr.
<HI>Sp&mdash;nc&mdash;r.</HI> Lord <HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y</HI> asked me who was
in the Bed-chamber? I &s;aid, Nobody;&mdash;well, Madam, &s;aid he, I know you
are a Lady of Veracity, but for once I pre&s;ume to doubt it; &s;o &s;aying, he
made to the Door, which &s;tood open, and Mr. <HI>Sp&mdash;nc&mdash;r</HI>
clapped it in his Face, doubled-locked it within-&s;ide, and to my great
Happine&s;s, went out of another Door down Stairs; this I was very glad of,
be|ing apprehen&s;ive of a Quarrel.&mdash;Lord <HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y</HI> was
in a violent Pa&s;|&s;ion, and in&s;i&s;ted on my telling him what Fellow, as
he called him, affronted him? So to &s;atisfy him, I very ingenuou&s;ly told
him the whole Story, to the infinite Mirth of Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x,</HI>
who, I thought, would have died with Laughter, for among&s;t other Accidents, I
had, in the Fray, lo&s;t a little <HI>Paris</HI> Cap I wore, and as my Hair was
very thick, never mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>But whatever I could &s;ay, would by no Means pacify Lord
<HI>G&mdash;lw&mdash;y</HI>; he <PB N="175" REF="182"> called me twenty
ungrateful Devils and Jilts, and I know not what, which &s;ur|prized me the
more, as I never in my Life imagined he loved me, and con&s;equently could not
form any Idea of his being jea|lous; but I &s;uppo&s;e, his Pride was piqued at
being locked out, which was the real Cau&s;e of his Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x</HI> in vain pleaded my Cau&s;e, till
at la&s;t, an odd Whim of his turned our Tragedy to a Farce.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x,</HI> it &s;eems, liked an
<HI>Italian</HI> Singer, on whom Lord <HI>R&mdash;y|m&mdash;d,</HI> a very
&s;mall Gentleman, with a Mind in Proportion to his diminutive Fi|gure, had
wrote a very &s;tupid Satire; he begged of me to write a Love-Letter to him,
for he was, it &s;eems, a Man of Gal|lantry, and his An&s;wer I was to
commu|nicate at <HI>White</HI>'s.</P>
<P>As I was a perfect Stranger to his Cha|racter, the Nobleman
dictated a fine En|comium on his Learning, Wit, Poetry, Beauty,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all of which united, had, it &s;eems, made a Conque&s;t of me,
unheard, un&s;een, and made me extremely ambitious <PB N="176" REF="183"> of
being known to &s;o accompli&s;hed a No|bleman; we al&s;o gave him &s;ome
Poetry, and a Direction where to find his mo&s;t enamoured Nymph. This done,
the Letter was di&s;|patched away to <HI>Bond-&s;treet,</HI> and the
Me&s;&s;enger brought Word I &s;hould have an An&s;wer in the Morning.</P>
<P>I know whoever reads this, may very po&s;&s;ibly cen&s;ure me; but
all who are de|pendant on the Favours of the Great, mu&s;t comply with their
Whim&s;ies; it is enough, if we are &s;o con&s;cientious as not to be made a
Slave to their Vices, as <HI>R&mdash;b&mdash;t N&mdash;g&mdash;t,</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> civilly asked me to be.</P>
<P>Now, as I have mentioned this Fellow, for &s;uch is the Term his
Behaviour to me merits, who am in this, in the &s;ame Mind with
<HI>Pope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mean a Fellow of T. C.
D.</NOTE>, That 
<Q> 
<L>Worth makes the Man, and want of it the Fellow;</L> 
<L>The re&s;t is all but Leather and Prunella.</L></Q> I hope my
Reader will allow me to give them a &s;hort Sketch of him, with Regard 
<PB N="177" REF="184"> to me, and al&s;o, of the Mortification I had the
Happine&s;s of giving him.</P>
<P>My Father attended his fir&s;t Wife, Lady <HI>E&mdash;ll&mdash;a
P&mdash;k&mdash;t,</HI> and, I had, I believe, pa&s;&s;ed twenty Evenings in
his Company in <HI>Dublin</HI>; he had publi&s;hed a Poem, written by the Rev.
Mr. <HI>Sterling,</HI> called <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> as his own, and another on
his Conver&s;ion from <HI>Popery,</HI> in&s;cribed to <HI>W&mdash;m
P&mdash;y,</HI> now Earl of <HI>B&mdash;h,</HI> to who&s;e Piety he was
indebted for his being drawn out of Error. This gave me a fine Opportunity of
paying him a Com|pliment, which I &s;ent to <HI>White</HI>'s; he &s;ent me Word
he would wait on me that Eve|ning; accordingly he came.</P>
<P>After his fir&s;t Salutation, he very po|litely a&s;ked me, if I
could help him to a W&mdash;, telling me, he had married an ugly old Devil for
Money, whom he hated, and wanted a Girl to take into Keeping, which he depended
on my Skill to chu&s;e for him: I thanked him for the honourable Employment he
recommended to me, but a&s;&s;ured him, it was not in my Power to &s;erve him,
as I never conver&s;ed <PB N="178" REF="185"> with Women. He told me, he would
not be a Friend to me on any other Terms; I &s;aid, I was &s;orry for it, &s;o
making him a Reverence, I left the Room. He &s;tayed in it &s;ome Time, hoping,
I &s;uppo&s;e, I was gone of his Errand, but finding I did not return, he went
away; but to do him Ju&s;tice, he left Half a Gui|nea on the Table, as a
Recompence for the Affront he had given me.</P>
<P>He wanted, it &s;eems, to be admitted as a Member of the Club at
<HI>White</HI>'s; their Way of Election is by ballotting, and one black Bean is
&s;ufficient to overturn any Man's Preten&s;ion to that Honour. I told my Story
&s;o effectually, that they all con|cluded him unfit for Society, and as many
Friends as he imagined he had among&s;t three hundred Nobles, and, as va&s;t a
For|tune as his Wife had brought him, he had but one white Bean in the whole
Draught.</P>
<P>However, I return him Thanks for his Ten and Sixpence, to &s;hew
my Gratitude.</P>
<P>But, to return to my little Lord <HI>R&mdash;ym&mdash;d.</HI>
Early next Morning, as I was drinking Tea, his Valet de Chambre 
<PB N="179" REF="186"> &s;aid he mu&s;t &s;peak to me. I de&s;ired he might
come in; he was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who, contrary to the re&s;t of his
Country, was as boori&s;h as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Farmer; he threw down a
Letter on the Table, 
<Q REND="inline">"Dere, my Lord &s;end a you dat;"</Q> I opened it,
and read as follows: 
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your Stile you ought to be a Gen|tlewoman; but I have met
with Things of this Kind, which did not an|&s;wer Expectation; I have &s;ent my
Man to &s;ee you, whom I always tru&s;t, and &s;o may you; if he likes you, and
you will come where I appoint, (for I never venture to vi&s;it any Woman) I
will meet you.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, 
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your's, R&mdash;YM&mdash;D.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="187">While I was peru&s;ing this gallant
Epi&s;tle, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> looked &s;harp about; he even opened the
Corner Cup|board; then he demanded of me what did I want with his Lorde? I
could not re&s;i&s;t my Inclination to laugh, at which he grew choleric, and
&s;wore, Garzoon, he &s;hould never come; which, I being quite ea&s;y about, he
went away muttering &s;ome|thing.</P>
<P>I &s;ent his Letter, which was wrote in a very bad Hand, and
almo&s;t every Word mi&s;-&s;pelt, to Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x,</HI> who
&s;hewed it to the Company at <HI>White</HI>'s, on whom it took the &s;ame
Effect it had done on me, for they all laughed heartily at
<HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI> a Nick-name Lord <HI>M&mdash;x</HI> had be&s;towed on
him.</P>
<P>The&s;e two merry Noblemen, who had &s;et me on this Scheme, would
fain have prevailed on me to &s;end another Letter to <HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI>
but I told them, I did not approve of a Man, governed by his Man, and one who
&s;eemed to be a Coward into the Bargain; Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x</HI> then
<PB N="181" REF="188"> me, Lord <HI>R&mdash;ym&mdash;d</HI> had &s;ome Rea&s;on
to be fearful how he made an A&s;&s;ignation, as he had once the Misfortune to
be taken in by a Billet-doux; and, when he went to the appointed Place,
in&s;tead of a fine Lady, found a Couple of &s;turdy Fellows, who gave him a
very good Cudgelling.</P>
<P>This put me in mind of a merry Story told me in <HI>London,</HI>
of Col. <HI>C&mdash;nn&mdash;m,</HI> who took Delight in paying his
Addre&s;&s;es to young Ladies, merely for Amu&s;ement; and no &s;ooner did he
perceive he had gained their Affection, but he de&s;pi&s;ed his Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>As the Noblemen knew him, I related one Story to them, out of
many, of a plea&s;ant Revenge a for&s;aken Nymph took on him.</P>
<P>This Lady was of exceeding good Birth, very well accompli&s;hed,
and of unblemi&s;hed Reputation, but not of Fortune equal to his; however, he
&s;eemed &s;o fond, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that would be no Ob&s;tacle, and
intirely devoted her&s;elf to the Plea&s;ure of loving him; which he no
&s;ooner perceived, but he grew cold, civil, and re&s;pectful, 
<PB N="182" REF="189"> and at la&s;t went to <HI>London,</HI> without &s;o much
as bidding her Farewel.</P>
<P>Her Step-father, Brigadier <HI>V&mdash;&s;&mdash;y,</HI> having
&s;ome Call there, took his Lady and her Children with him, where, though
Mi&s;s <HI>A&mdash;t,</HI> for that was the Lady's Name, frequently &s;aw the
Colonel at Court, he never took the lea&s;t Notice of her, but &s;eemed as
never acquainted: This, as we may pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently grieved her, &s;he
made her Complaint to a Female Confidante, a Lady of Quality, and a Wo|man of
Spirit; between them they con|trived, at lea&s;t, to give his Vanity a
terri|ble Mortification.</P>
<P>They wrote to him a Letter, as from a married Dutche&s;s, who was
fallen in Love with him at Court; the Chairman had Di|rections to wait for his
An&s;wer, but they took Care that he &s;hould not be able to gue&s;s who &s;ent
it;&mdash;all that the Colonel could di&s;cover was, that it was given to him
in the Street, and he was ordered to leave the An&s;wer at a Mercer's, where it
would be &s;afe delivered to the Per&s;on who wrote the Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190">This Secrecy made him quite &s;ure he had
gained the Heart of &s;ome high-born Fair; he failed not to &s;end a
pa&s;&s;ionate and tender Return for &s;o great an Honour as the unknown
Charmer had done him. The Ladies received it, and were glad to find the Gudgeon
&s;wallow the Bait &s;o gree|dily. Next Night he took care to dre&s;s him&s;elf
with the utmo&s;t Magnificence; and, as he is really a graceful Per&s;on, he
made no doubt but the Lady would, by &s;ome favourable Glance, di&s;cover
her&s;elf to him; to this End, he went to Court, and &s;trictly examined the
Countenance of every Lady of Quality there to no Purpo&s;e, which only made him
&s;uppo&s;e the Lady extremely di&s;creet, and careful of her Re|putation.</P>
<P>His imaginary Mi&s;tre&s;s made &s;everal Appointments with him,
then &s;ent him Word, her Lord was come to Town, or &s;ome Apology, 'till at
la&s;t, tired with their Sport, they re&s;olved to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>To this End, he received a Letter, that the Lady could not find
out any Place where &s;he could, without Danger of Di&s;|covery, 
<PB N="184" REF="191"> meet him, except at his own Hou&s;e, but begged, that he
might not let any of his Servants be in the Way; that &s;he would come in a
Chair, exactly at Ten, one &s;mall Tap at the Door being the Signal for
Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Never did Knight-Errant propo&s;e to him&s;elf more Glory in the
fini&s;hing of an Adventure, than did our happy Colonel at his near approaching
Bli&s;s; he had framed to him&s;elf an Idea of a perfect Beauty, kind, tender,
and formed for Love; his An&s;wer was all Rapture, and Acknow|ledgment.</P>
<P>His Apartments were filled with Wax Lights, him&s;elf curled,
perfumed, and dre&s;&s;ed to &s;uch Advantage; who could re|&s;i&s;t that
beheld him? He punctually o|beyed the Ladies Commands, in di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing all
the Servants, with Orders not to appear, and waited the happy Minute, with the
Impatience of a real Lover; every Moment he looked at his Watch, and thought
the Hours, Ages.</P>
<P>At length the long wi&s;hed for Signal was given, he flew to
receive the Fair-one, <PB N="185" REF="192"> when a Porter delivered a Band-box
into his Hand, and, without &s;peaking a Word to him vani&s;hed. Never was any
Man in greater Confu&s;ion than he, at opening it; he there found, not only all
his own &s;oft Epi&s;|tles, but al&s;o a little Doll in a Chair, with a Letter
in her Hand, directed to him, the Purport of which, was, to let him know he was
a conceited Coxcomb, to &s;uppo&s;e any Woman of Quality had the lea&s;t
Re|gard for him, and, that the Lady who held that, was a Mi&s;tre&s;s good
enough for him.</P>
<P>The Noblemen thanked me for my Narration, and wi&s;hed the Trick
had been put on <HI>Jack-a-Dandy,</HI> &s;uch a Lady being a much more
&s;uitable Match for him than the Colonel; however, we all agreed, that this
was no Tax on the Gentleman's Un|der&s;tanding, 
<Q> 
<L>Since, let a Man be ne'er &s;o wi&s;e,</L> 
<L>He may be caught, with &s;ober Lyes.</L></Q> And, that his
Appearance might captivate a Lady, without any Miracle.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>M&mdash;dd&mdash;x</HI> did me the Honour to
&s;ub&s;cribe, and, a&s;&s;ured me, he would pre|vail <PB N="186" REF="193"> on
as many of his Friends as he could, to do me the &s;ame Favour.</P>
<P>Next Day Colonel <HI>Duncombe</HI> asked me, did I know &s;uch a
Gentleman of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as <HI>L&mdash;ft&mdash;s H&mdash;e,</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; I &s;aid I did, particularly well, as my Brother and he
were in&s;eparable Companions in the Col|lege; he told me, there was a Parcel
of Letters freed by the Earl <HI>Thomond,</HI> then ju&s;t dead, lying for him
at <HI>White</HI>'s, and, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee him, to learn
&s;ome Account of the Particulars of Lord <HI>Thomond</HI>'s Death, with whom
he had for many Years a &s;trict Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>As I had learned by Accident where Mr. <HI>H&mdash;e</HI> lived, I
wrote to let him know what the Colonel &s;aid; he &s;ent me a Letter of Thanks,
and, that he would do him&s;elf the Honour of meeting the Colonel the next
Evening at my Apart|ment.</P>
<P>It &s;o fortuned that my kind Benefactor Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> came
over with the Colonel, and a little after came Mr. <HI>H&mdash;e</HI>; his
Politene&s;s, and the many plea&s;ing Inci|dents of our younger Days, gave me 
<PB N="187" REF="194"> infinite Delight, as it was a Proof that I was not an
Impo&s;tor, and convinced the Auditors I had once been in E&s;teem, even in my
own Country.</P>
<P>After a good deal of agreeable Chat, wherein Mr.
<HI>H&mdash;e</HI> took an Opportunity of mentioning his having, when he was in
the College, &s;pent his whole Year's Al|lowance in making one grand Ball; and
that, as on this Occa&s;ion, he was in Di&s;|grace with his own Father, he
quartered him&s;elf on mine, prai&s;ing his elegant man|ner of living, and the
kind Reception he always received from him, which as he &s;aid, he mu&s;t ever
acknowledge to his Family; Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;aid, he hoped, as I was the
only de&s;olate Per&s;on belonging to it, he would be &s;o good as to
a&s;&s;i&s;t me. He a&s;ked, how it was in his Power? Why, returned he, this
poor Lady is obliged to publi&s;h her Writings by Sub&s;cription, and I dare
&s;ay, a Gentleman of her own Coun|try, who has &s;o fine a Fortune, and knows
her &s;o many Years, will, at lea&s;t, be as kind as Strangers have been to
her: With|out <PB N="188" REF="195"> doubt, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>H&mdash;e,</HI>
it is the Duty of every Gentleman to do it; &s;o ri&s;ing, he told me, he was
very &s;orry he was under an Engagement to the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI>
but that he would take ano|ther Opportunity of paying his Re&s;pects to me;
which &s;ame Opportunity, as he never found in <HI>London,</HI> I hope he will
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and have &s;uch a Dependance on his Honour, that I am
certain, he will keep it, in being my Friend.</P>
<P>As I had the Honour of being once a kind of a Favourite to
Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> I judged him a very proper Per&s;on, both as he had
been a Printer, and was al&s;o a Man of con&s;iderable Intere&s;t, to apply to,
both to increa&s;e my Sub&s;cription, and to put me into a Method of getting my
Wri|tings printed as cheap as I could; to this end, I wrote him a very
re&s;pectful Letter, but received no An&s;wer; I followed it with a Second,
&s;till he was &s;ilent; at length, I found a Method to make him &s;peak to me,
for, recollecting the be&s;t Part of a very &s;evere Satyr Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had <PB N="189" REF="196"> wrote on him, I let him know I
had it, on which he invited me to his Hou&s;e, re|ceived me very kindly,
apologized for his Silence, being ill of the Gout, which had hindered him from
an&s;wering me; and a&s;|&s;ured me, as &s;oon as he was able to go abroad, he
would pre&s;ent me as a Compa|nion to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
who had promi&s;ed to take one of his Recom|mendation, and who, he &s;aid,
being in the Decline of Life, and having no Children, would, he was certain, if
I had the good Fortune to plea&s;e her, remember me in her Will; but unhappily
for me the Al|derman died a few Days after, nor did the Dutche&s;s long
&s;urvive him.</P>
<P>So vani&s;hed my Hopes.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this Di&s;appointment, which &s;en&s;ibly
affected me, my Landlady told me, there was an ugly &s;quinting old Fellow, who
&s;aid he had Bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence, and mu&s;t &s;peak to
me; I bid her &s;hew him up, and found he an&s;wered her De&s;cription; he
a&s;ked me, was my Name <HI>Meade?</HI> I &s;aid, yes; why 
<PB N="190" REF="197"> then, &s;aid he, I am come to inform you, that there is
a Legacy of five hundred Pounds left you by one Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> who died
la&s;t Week at <HI>St. Edmond&s;bury,</HI> but the Lady I was ordered to
inquire for is Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Wife; are you the Per&s;on? I told him
the Direction was very right, but that I neither was related to, nor even
ac|quainted with any Per&s;on of the Name of <HI>Clark,</HI> from whom I had
the &s;malle&s;t Rea|&s;on to hope for &s;uch a Favour: Nay, Madam, returned
he, as you have changed your Name, why may not he? Upon this, he &s;hewed me a
Letter, to my Fancy au|thentic, wherein I was de&s;ired, if living, to wait on
Coun&s;ellor <HI>Clark</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Street</HI> in the
<HI>Strand,</HI> who had Orders to pay me the Money, on Proof I was Mrs.
<HI>Pil|kington.</HI></P>
<P>I knew not what to make of all this; I was in hopes the fickle
Godde&s;s, who is well repre&s;ented &s;tanding on a Wheel, was, for once, in a
good Humour with me, and was re&s;olved to make me amends for her former
Caprice, or, to &s;peak more &s;eriou&s;ly, that the Supreme Almighty Being,
that Power, who 
<Q><PB N="191" REF="198"> 
<L>Builds Life on Death, on Change Du|ration founds,</L> 
<L>And gives th' eternal Wheels to know their Rounds,</L></Q> had
taken Compa&s;&s;ion on my Sufferings.</P>
<P>While I was lo&s;t in mu&s;ing on this odd Adventure, the old
Fellow asked me very gaily, if I would give him my Company to
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and take a Dinner with him? I told him I never went abroad
with Per|&s;ons I did not know, e&s;pecially Men; he told me, he was very
capable of being &s;er|viceable to me, and that it was al&s;o in my Power to be
&s;o to him; in what, Sir? Why, I have received from <HI>Ireland,</HI> from
your Hu&s;band, the Life of Alderman <HI>Barber,</HI> wherein there is an
Account of the Amours of <HI>Cadenus</HI> and <HI>Vane&s;&s;a,</HI> to which
the Alderman was privy, and related them to Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n:</HI> Now I have
been informed you have &s;ome Letters of the Dean's, which may embelli&s;h the
Work; and al&s;o a true Character of the Alderman, written by his Chaplain; I
will make you <PB N="192" REF="199"> a hand&s;ome Con&s;ideration for them, if
you will give them to me to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e &s;urprized me almo&s;t as much as the fir&s;t;
I therefore begged he would not hold me any longer in Su&s;pence, but let me
know who I conver&s;ed with? He an&s;wered his Name was <HI>Edmund Curl,</HI>
upon which, in &s;pite of Vexation, and the Di&s;appointment of my new-born
Hope, I could not forbear laughing at the fine Scheme he had laid, to trick me
out of any valuable Manu&s;cripts I might po&s;&s;ibly po&s;|&s;e&s;s; &s;o
making him a Courte&s;y, I &s;aid, Farewel, Legacy!</P>
<P>I &s;hould not trouble the Reader with this Story, but that I have
been charged with writing the Life of the Alderman; and, as I &s;hall an&s;wer
it to God, I never even &s;aw it in my Life, not but Curio&s;ity would have
engaged me to read it, e&s;pe|cially as I heard it was very well wrote; but at
the Time it was publi&s;hed, I was a Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI>
and really had not a Crown to &s;pare for a Book.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> &s;wore heartily, that his Letter, with
regard to the Legacy, was <PB N="193" REF="200"> genuine, I went the next Day
to Coun|&s;ellor <HI>Clark</HI>; there was indeed an old Gen|tleman of his name
newly dead, at <HI>St. Ed|monsbury,</HI> who had Children and Grand|children,
Heirs at Law, &s;ufficient to in|herit his Fortune, and, as it happened, he
died inte&s;tate.</P>
<P>However I comforted my&s;elf that Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> had not made a
Fool of me, as he has done of many a better Writer, and &s;e|cured me a
Pri&s;oner in his poetical Garret, which the ingenious Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>
charm|ingly ridicules.</P>
<P>But oh the di&s;mal Summer (which ever was attended with Want and
all it's gloomy Train, not only to me, but many Per&s;ons who &s;eem in good
Circum&s;tances) left me quite de&s;olate, and obliged me to take a cheaper
Lodging, which I did in the Hou&s;e of one Mrs. <HI>Trifoli</HI> in
<HI>Duke-&s;treet, St. James</HI>'s, a mo&s;t extraordinary painted up,
bedizened-out old Woman, who&s;e Hu&s;band was a <HI>German</HI> Quack, not
then in <HI>England,</HI> from which, it &s;eems his Wife had obliged him to
fly, for robbing her of a Deed of Settlement he had made to 
<PB N="194" REF="201"> her at Marriage; but to &s;ay the Truth, I think that
was a Ble&s;&s;ing to the poor Man, for &s;he was a very Devil incarnate,
un|merciful and cruel to the la&s;t Degree: I dare &s;ay, &s;he never in her
Life gave even a Cup of Water or a Mor&s;el of Bread, to keep a poor Creature
from &s;tarving!</P>
<P>Her Cu&s;tom was to live upon her Lodgers, even when &s;he knew
they were de&s;olately poor, ina&s;much, that if one of them &s;ent but for a
Pint of Small-Beer, &s;he would intercept it in the Way, and drink half of it;
but indeed &s;he was very civil, for &s;he always &s;ent them Word &s;he drank
their Healths, and &s;o &s;he did in reality, by depriving them of the Means of
pre|&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Being &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this avaritious Wretch, I was
advi&s;ed to apply to Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> who was a Man of Ta&s;te, and had
&s;ixty thou&s;and Pounds left him, to give in &s;uch Charities as he thought
proper. Ac|cordingly I wrote him a moving Tale of my Di&s;tre&s;s, which had
&s;o good an Effect, that he &s;ent me Word he would wait on me him&s;elf the
next Day, but not keeping his Word, I addre&s;t him in the following Lines:

<P><PB N="197" REF="204">I &s;ent the&s;e Rhymes to the Doctor, and,
in return, was de&s;ired to come to his Hou&s;e in <HI>Ormond-&s;treet,</HI> at
Four o'Clock that Afternoon.</P>
<P>Now were my Hopes high rai&s;ed, high as the Spring Tide, to which
the Ebb quickly &s;ucceeds, as it did with me; I fancied, vainly fancied! at
lea&s;t ten Guineas in my Pocket, and had, like the Man with his Basket of
Gla&s;&s;es, turned them into Trade, and purcha&s;ed in my Mind an ea&s;y
Sub&s;i&s;tence for Life; but I was a little mi&s;|taken in the Matter, as the
Sequel will &s;hew. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf very neatly, and waited on the
Doctor; when I knocked at his Door, a Footman with his Mouth very full, and a
Bone in his Hand, opened it, and in an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Accent, demanded my
Bu&s;ine&s;s? I told him I wanted to &s;peak to the Doctor: 
<Q REND="inline">"By my own Shoul, &s;aid he, my Mai&s;hter will
not be &s;poke to by Nobody!"</Q> Well then, Friend, if you plea&s;e to let him
know Mrs. <HI>Meade</HI> is here, I believe he will &s;peak to me: 
<Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;htri&s;h <HI>Maide,</HI> replied he, Arah,
are you vanting Charity, and taakes up my Mai&s;hter's Name to claim 
<PB N="198" REF="205"> Kin with him; well, &s;tay there, I'll tell him."</Q> So
he went into a back Par|lour, but was quite confounded, when the Doctor
in&s;tantly came out, and gave him a &s;evere Reprimand for letting me &s;tand
in the Hall; and I am very certain, had I thought it worth my While to have
ac|quainted the Docter with his In&s;olence, he would have been di&s;charged. A
proper Caution to Livery-wearing Fellows to &s;peak with Civility to every
Body.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;hewed me into a hand&s;ome Street-parlour, adorned
with &s;everal Curio|&s;ities, of which here needs no Account: He asked me for
Sir <HI>John Meade,</HI> whom, becau&s;e he remembered, he expected I &s;hould,
though he died two Years before I was born; when I told him &s;o, he &s;eemed
di&s;plea&s;ed: And really I remember that good Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> in his
plea&s;ant Way, &s;colded me once for not remembering King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
though my Father was born in the Reign of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>As my An&s;wers to the Doctor, with re|lation to the whole Family
of the <HI>Meades,</HI> were &s;ufficient to convince him I was not an 
<PB N="199" REF="206"> Impo&s;tor, he asked me how he could &s;erve me? I told
him I had &s;ome Poems to publi&s;h, but for Want of a little Money to pay for
the Printing of them, I could not proceed: 
<Q REND="inline">"Poems, returned he; why, did you ever know any
Per&s;on get Mo|ney by Poetry?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">Yes, Sir, &s;everal; Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in
particular:"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh Lud, Lud, (&s;aid he, grinning horribly, and
&s;quinting hideou&s;ly) what Vanity thou ha&s;t! can you write like him?"</Q>
I was quite aba&s;hed, and really knew not what to &s;ay for &s;ome Moments,
for my Reader may ea&s;ily perceive, I could not but be &s;en&s;ible I had made
a fooli&s;h Speech, un|aware to my&s;elf; however, upon Recollec|tion, I
a&s;&s;ured him, I did not pre&s;ume to put my&s;elf in any Degree of
Compari&s;on with &s;o ju&s;tly an admired Writer, but that perhaps, on Account
of my Sex, I might find a little Favour,</P>
<P>Well &s;aid he, there are a Couple of Gui|neas for you: This,
though far &s;hort of my Expectations, was a little pre&s;ent Relief, and as
the Gentleman was under no Obliga|tion <PB N="200" REF="207"> to reward or
encourage me, I very gratefully accepted of them, and yet 
<Q>

<L>A willing Stranger at a Great Man's Gate!</L></Q></P>
<P>And here gentle Reader, give me Leave to tre&s;pa&s;s a Moment on
your Patience, to make one Remark, which is, that, among&s;t all the Per&s;ons
who are celebrated for be|ing charitable, I never met one really &s;o; and the
mo&s;t humane and beneficent are tho&s;e who&s;e Characters have been &s;o
at|tacked for their Humanity, that at la&s;t they have even been a&s;hamed of
well-doing.</P>
<P>I remember Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> told me, he &s;aw a Beggar attack at
Bi&s;hop, who charitably from his Abundance, &s;pared him a Half|penny, and
&s;aid, God ble&s;s you; pre&s;ently after he attacked Brigadier
<HI>Groves,</HI> who threw Half a Crown to him, and bade G&mdash;d d&mdash;m
him; which, &s;aid he, do you think the Beggar prayed for at Night?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="208">But as I have mentioned Dr. <HI>Meade,</HI>
who was &s;o much in Love with Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> for &s;aying, 
<Q>

<HI>Ha&mdash;s,</HI> to whom the Doctor advi&s;ed me to apply, as an Encourager
of Arts. I travelled down to <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> to wait upon him; it &s;nowed
violently, in&s;omuch that I, who had only a Chintz Gown on, was wet to the

I had &s;ent up a Compliment, which, as he did not de&s;erve, I &s;hall not do
him the Ho|nour to in&s;ert, invited me into his Lodge, where, after about two
Hours Attendance, I was at length permitted to enter to his Supreme Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ty; but &s;ure the Pope him|&s;elf,
in all his pontifical Robes, never was half &s;o proud. I was conducted by an
E&s;|cort thro' &s;ix or &s;even Rooms, one of which was entirely
wain&s;cotted, if I may &s;o term it, with China; but like the Idol to whom 
<PB N="202" REF="209"> a &s;tately Temple was con&s;ecrated, which a Traveller,
attracted by it's outward Mag|nificence, thought to find an adorable Deity in,

very well convinced never &s;aw me, for he did not even vouch&s;afe to turn his
Eyes off a Paper he was writing, to &s;ee who came in, till at la&s;t a
Beggar-Woman entered, with a &s;ore eyed Child; the In|&s;ide of who&s;e
Eyelids he very charitably tore out with a Beard of Corn, under which cruel
Operation the Girl fainted, but he &s;aid that was good for her: It may be
&s;o, for by two-headed <HI>Janus,</HI> Nature has fra|med &s;trange Doctors in
her Time.

a&s;ked me what I wanted? if I had bad Eyes he &s;aid he would bru&s;h them up
for Charity; but as they happened to be tolerably good, I excu&s;ed my&s;elf,
by tel|ling him I had brought him that Letter; and indeed I was quick-&s;ighted
enough to find out, that his Honour (as the Beggar-woman called him) was a
conceited, ridi|culous, imperious old Fool.&mdash;He then con&s;idered my

to him, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Poor Creature! I &s;up|po&s;e you want Charity;

like a Three-penny Shovel-groat; and was only con|&s;trained by the
Con&s;ideration, that I had never a Shilling in my Pocket, and that, little as
it was, I could eat for it.</P>
<P>I have here done with the Great Sir <HI>H&mdash;ns

Dr. <HI>Meade.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211">I had forgot to tell my Readers, that
re|juicing at my Succe&s;s, when I returned from his Hou&s;e I threw the two
Guineas up, and had the Misfortune to lo&s;e one in a Chink of the Room; the
Board my Land|lady would never permit me to remove, le&s;t, as &s;he &s;aid, I
&s;hould &s;poil her Floor. This trivial Accident gave me a great deal of
Unea&s;ine&s;s, as it put me out of Power of paying, and quitting her according
to my Intention.</P>
<P>However, as I was obliged to live by my Wits, which indeed were

<HI>P&mdash;p</HI> Lord <HI>H&mdash;k,</HI> then newly created L&mdash;d

I &s;ent all round, like the Bi&s;hop's Pa&s;toral Letter; it was, as
<HI>Swift</HI> &s;ays, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;In another Reign,</L> 
<L>Change but the Name, 'twill do again.</L></Q> I wrote a fire
new one for him&s;elf, which was really paying him a higher Compliment 
<PB N="205" REF="212"> than he de&s;erved, as my Readers may per|ceive
hereafter. I had compleated the Poem, and &s;ent it to him; he de&s;ired me to
come to him on <HI>Sunday,</HI> that being his only lei&s;ure Time.&mdash;</P>
<P>Accordingly, I waited on him at Eight o'Clock on <HI>Sunday</HI>
Morning; the Hou&s;e had rather the Appearance of De&s;olation and Poverty,
than that of the L&mdash;d Ch&mdash;ll&mdash;r of <HI>Br&mdash;n:</HI> He had
Complai|&s;ance enough to &s;end his Mace-Bearer to keep me Company, till
&s;uch time as a Pair of Folding-doors flew open, and my Lord appeared in his
Robes, ready to go to Church; he bowed down to the Ground to me, and a&s;ked me
if I would drink a Di&s;h of Chocolate with him? which you may not doubt I
accepted of; and was &s;urprized to find my&s;elf, though &s;unk in the mo&s;t
abject Poverty, &s;itting with &s;o great a Man!</P>
<P>So, for my Labour, I got a Di&s;h of 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem. Chocolate,</HI> a Word u&s;ed by
a very emi|nent Comedian, one Mr. <HI>Foote,</HI> for Satire.</NOTE>Chocolate,
which I now return, with the <PB N="206" REF="213"> utmo&s;t Humility, to his
L&mdash;d&mdash;p again.</P>
<P>So, my Lord went to Church, where I al&s;o went; I there &s;aw
Doctor <HI>Meade,</HI> who, perceiving his Lord&s;hip made me a low Bow, made
one four times as low; and I could very hardly refrain laughing at them both,
and thinking 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;That all this World's a Stage, and</L> 
<L>All the Men and Women merely Actors;</L></Q> And that 
<Q> 
<L>If ev'ry ju&s;t Man, that now pines with Want,</L>

<P>Well, I could find no Remedy for the Con&s;umption of my Pur&s;e,
nor borrow, to linger out the Di&s;ea&s;e, any where, but from the Pawnbroker;
but he was always cha|ritable.</P>
<P>However, I concealed my Di&s;tre&s;s with the utmo&s;t Care from
my Landlady; called every Morning for the Teakettle, though I had no
Tea;&mdash;then I &s;aid I was enga|ged to dine abroad, and took a &s;olitary
Walk to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby,</HI>&mdash;and ranged the &s;olemn I&s;les
alone, envying tho&s;e who re&s;ted in Peace from their Labours; till, at
la&s;t, having been three Days and three Nights without Food of any kind,
Heaven pardon me! a melancholy Thought came into my Head, that it was better to
die at once, than die daily; and that, as I could <PB N="208" REF="215"> not
Fardles bear, it was be&s;t to make my own <HI>Quietus,</HI> and no longer
&s;trive to keep up a frail and feveri&s;h Being: And here, indeed, I own, I
had been unmindful of the Crown which Virtue gives, 
<Q> 
<L>After this mortal Coil, to her true Ser|vants.</L></Q>
De&s;pair vanqui&s;hed me quite; nay, &s;o art|ful was the Enemy, as even to
per&s;uade me, I had a Right to di&s;po&s;e of my own Life, e&s;pecially when
there did not &s;eem, even a Po&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;erving it. Filled with
gloomy Ideas, I took my u&s;ual Walk, and took notice of the Corner, between
the Monuments of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Rowe,</HI> where I wi&s;hed to
be interred, and that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Lines, 
<Q>

<L>An Heap of Du&s;t alone remains of me,</L> 
<L>'Tis all I am, 'tis all the Proud &s;hall be.</L></Q> 
<PB N="209" REF="216"> might be my Epitaph. I really found room for Meditation,
even to Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In this Temper I went into <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> and
&s;eated my&s;elf by <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>'s Pond; the Moon, apparent Queen,
un|veiled her peerle&s;s Light, and I waited in the &s;ilent Shade, re&s;olved
to execute my dreadful Purpo&s;e, as &s;oon as I could do it without
Ob&s;ervation, when a young Lady, and an old one, both very well dre&s;&s;ed,
&s;eated them&s;elves by me; they, in an ele|gant Stile began to prai&s;e the
&s;weet and &s;olemn Beauties of the Moon-light Scene, the Winds gently
whi&s;pered through the fragrant Lime-trees, ju&s;t then in full Flower; and,
indeed, though they were not vernal Airs, they might have di&s;&s;ipated all
Angui&s;h, but De&s;pair: Finding, that not|with&s;tanding my Taciturnity, the
Ladies would enter into Conver&s;ation with me, I could not, in Point of good
Breeding, re|fu&s;e to return them An&s;wers, with as much Politene&s;s, as I
was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, till at length, we were &s;o plea&s;ed with each other,
that Time in&s;en&s;ibly flying, we found we were locked into the
<HI>Park</HI>; but the Ladies, <PB N="210" REF="217"> who&s;e Garden opened
into it, in&s;i&s;ted on my accompanying them to Supper.</P>
<P>We were let in at a Back-door, by a Servant in Livery, to a very
genteel Hou&s;e, where, on a Sopha, &s;at a very hand&s;ome Man in a Gold
Brocade Night-Gown, to whom the young Lady pre&s;ented me, and &s;aid, he was
her Spou&s;e; the Cloth was ready laid, and a cold Supper on the Table: I would
very fain have pre|vailed on the Lady to permit me to go through her Hou&s;e
home, for I could ea|&s;ily perceive the Gentleman's Civility was quite forced,
and, that he was impatient to revenge on his Wife the Liberty &s;he had taken
of inviting a Stranger in; which in|deed, I believe, &s;he did on no other
Ac|count, but, that &s;he thought Decency would prevent him from giving her a
Beating, of which, it &s;eems, he was very liberal, though he was but a Footman
when the Lady married him, and threw her&s;elf, and twenty thou&s;and Pounds
away upon him, as I afterwards learned.</P>
<P>But, as the late Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> ob|&s;erved, when he
was told a Maid of Ho|nour, <PB N="211" REF="218"> who was very hand&s;ome, was
in Love with him, notwith&s;tanding he was an old Hump-back'd Man, but one of
in|finite Wit, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Faith, it may be &s;o, Women have &s;trange
Fancies!"</Q></P>
<P>I, though foodle&s;s, never &s;pent three Hours more
di&s;agreeably, e&s;pecially, as this Hou&s;e brought back to my Mind, the Fear
and Terror I always felt in Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s, to which, if my Father,
Mother, or any Friend came, it threw me into Agonies, being well a&s;&s;ured,
they would never de|part without receiving &s;ome gro&s;s Affront, &s;uch as
the two following Stories, trivial as they are, may &s;erve to
illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>One <HI>Alhallow</HI>'s Eve, a Night of Plea|&s;ure and Di&s;port
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> among the young Maidens and Batchelors, my Brother and
Si&s;ter, who had invited &s;ome Per&s;ons, agreeable to their own Age, to
celebrate it with them, very fairly begged of us, old Folks, to go abroad; to
oblige them, and my&s;elf al&s;o, I begged of Doctor <HI>Delany,</HI> who dined
with us, and my Father and Mother, to come home with me, and try 
<PB N="212" REF="219"> if we could not be as chearful as they: I no &s;ooner
propo&s;ed the Scheme than they all agreed to it. As my Father was no
Supper-Man, I had ordered a Cu&s;tard to be made for him, and having a
barn&s;table Oven, it was put into it to bake.</P>
<P>While we were amu&s;ing our&s;elves in a|greeable Chat, entered
Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> like the De&s;cription of Winter, 
<Q> 
<L>Striding the gloomy Bla&s;t!</L></Q> and ob&s;erving a Smoak,
occa&s;ioned by the lighting of the Oven, he de&s;cended to ex|amine the
Contents thereof, found the Cu&s;tard, eat mo&s;t part of it, and &s;ent the
Remainder out of Doors, telling us to our Faces, we &s;hould not liquor our
Chops at his Expence; though, <HI>memorandum,</HI> my dear Father always &s;ent
his Supper and Wine before him, whenever he vouch&s;afed us the Honour of a
Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd In&s;tance of my Spou&s;e's Good-nature, was, that
though he had no le&s;s than thirteen Hens, he, knowing I liked a new-laid Egg
for my Supper, watched <PB N="213" REF="220"> the Hen-roo&s;t clo&s;e, and
every Egg was in a Ba&s;ket &s;ent to the Widow <HI>W&mdash;rr&mdash;n,</HI>
covered with a Dama&s;k Napkin, of which &s;he got no le&s;s than eighteen
given to me by Brigadier <HI>Meade</HI>: At length, one Even|ing, when my
Hu&s;band was abroad, my Brother and Si&s;ter came to vi&s;it me; when the
Clock &s;truck Ten, I concluded Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> would not come home to
Supper, and I had the Impudence to eat two Eggs; they were &s;carce down when
he came in, my Brother had &s;ent for a Bottle of Wine, and invited his
Reverence to drink a Gla&s;s, but 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem.</HI> He &s;ays, in one of his
Letters, that the Nobility &s;corned me, and my vile In&s;inuations and
Impudence.</NOTE>he &s;corned us and our vile In&s;inuations; and as he always
kept an exact Reckoning for his Poultry, he very magi&s;terially or|dered his
Eggs to be got ready; this was a Thunder-clap to me; however, as it was in vain
to attempt to hide my Guilt, I was forced to confe&s;s the horrid Fact; upon
which he &s;tood agha&s;t, as though he had &s;een Church-yards yawn, and Hell
it&s;elf breathe forth Contagion to the World.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221">What, &s;aid he, did you eat my black Hen's
Egg? Could not any other &s;atisfy your dirty Guts? I wi&s;h the Devil was in
the Egg, and that it had choaked you.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, he had preferred his chari|table Wi&s;h too late;
and, le&s;t it &s;hould take any Effect, I drank a Gla&s;s of my Bro|ther's
Wine, that I might dige&s;t all toge|ther.</P>
<P>Oh, let the World judge how happy I was! But to return.</P>
<P>Though my <HI>Park</HI> Adventure had di|verted the Execution of
my &s;ad Scheme for one Evening, yet, as it had brought me no Relief, I &s;till
kept my Purpo&s;e, and re&s;olved to fulfil it the next: To this End, I came
and &s;at in the &s;ame Place; I made &s;everal Attempts to throw my&s;elf in,
and &s;till, when I came near the Water, the Fear of &s;omething after Death
puzzled the Will; I examined my Heart &s;trictly, to know what gro&s;s Offence
I had ever committed, that it &s;hould 
<Q> 
<L>Plea&s;e Heav'n to try me with Afflictions,</L>

<L><PB N="215" REF="222">Give to Captivity me and my utmo&s;t

filled the Widow's Eyes with Tears, I &s;hould not wonder at it. Quite lo&s;t
in the&s;e melancholy Reflec|tions, I was waked as from a Dream, by a very well
dre&s;&s;ed Gentleman, who tapped me on the Shoulder, and &s;aid, Lord, can
this be Mrs. <HI>Pilkington?</HI> I looked at him earne&s;tly, and recollecting
I had &s;een his Face before, an&s;wered, it was all the Re|mains of her that
was Mrs. <HI>Pilkington.</HI> May I pre&s;ume, Madam, to a&s;k, on what
Intention you are &s;itting her? I fancy he perceived by my Looks the
Di&s;order of my Soul, which, I believe, was &s;trongly pictured there. I
begged he would leave me to my&s;elf&mdash;But he in&s;i&s;ted on my going
along with him to the <HI>Royal Vineyard,</HI> which was not far off&mdash;it
was in vain to refu&s;e him, he would take no Denial. When we were got about
half way, I very &s;e|riou&s;ly demanded of him, who he was? He an&s;wered, he
was Capt. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had <PB N="216" REF="223"> once the Honour of
&s;eeing me at my Uncle <HI>Van Lewen</HI>'s in <HI>Cork,</HI> and who &s;hould
think him&s;elf very happy, if it was any way in his power to &s;erve me. We
got a cold Fowl and &s;ome Ham, of which I eat a little, and took a Gla&s;s or
two of <HI>Cham|paigne,</HI> and I found it revive me very much. We then fell
into Di&s;cour&s;e, and I very &s;incerely related to him my unhappy Situation,
and the Peril his Appearance had delivered me from. My Story affected him &s;o
much, that it drew Tears from him.</P>
<P>After we had regaled our&s;elves, it grow|ing late, we left the
<HI>Park,</HI> and he was &s;o kind to &s;ee me to my Lodging; where, putting a
couple of Guineas into my Hand, we parted, and he promi&s;ed to &s;ee me next
Morning; but I &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, when Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> comes to this part of my
Story, he will wi&s;h the Gentleman had been buried, &s;ooner than he &s;hould
do him &s;o ill an Office, as that of &s;aving my Life; but I, among other
things, was born to let the World &s;ee, what the In&s;ide of a Prie&s;t is
made of; 
<Q><PB N="217" REF="224"> 
<L>Prompt, or to &s;tab, or &s;aint, to &s;ave, or damn;</L> 
<L>Heav'n's <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> who fight for any God, or Man!</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> Take notice, I always except the good and
valuable part of the Clergy, whom nobody more highly re&s;pects and honours
than I &s;incerely do; for when they po&s;&s;e&s;s, like <HI>Berkley,</HI>
every Virtue under Heaven, who can refu&s;e it?</P>
<P>I once more began to believe my&s;elf un|der the Favour and
Protection of the Al|mighty; as his Hand, though to me in|vi&s;ible, vi&s;ibly
led me through various Mazes, perplexed with Error; and deter|mined, whatever
Sufferings he was plea&s;ed to inflict, to bear them with Re&s;ignation, and
never permit them to triumph over a Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>And a &s;evere and cruel Trial of my Con&s;tancy I quickly
experienced; there was a young Woman, who lodged in the Gar|ret, whom I not
only to the utmo&s;t of my Power &s;upported, as &s;he was my Country-woman, 
<PB N="218" REF="225"> and in great Di&s;tre&s;s, but al&s;o as &s;he &s;aid
&s;he was related to the Lord <HI>Power&s;court</HI>; her Maiden Name, as &s;he
told me, was <HI>Craggs</HI>; his Lord&s;hip may better know whether this was
true or fal&s;e, than I can pre&s;ume to do; however, I had often made her a
Confidante to my Di&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he as con&s;tantly revealed to my
in|exorable Landlady; who one Day, pre|tending great Compa&s;&s;ion, told me
what a Snake I harboured in my Bo&s;om, and &s;aid, as &s;he had learned from
her, that I had &s;e|veral valuable Things in Pawn, &s;he would relea&s;e them,
and keep them in her own Hands, till &s;uch time as I could pay her the Trifle
I owed her. I thought this a kind Offer, and with great Acknowledg|ment
accepted of it: Oh! what a Fool was I, to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch a <HI>Jew</HI> of
any Remor&s;e? I gave her a Line to the Pawnbroker, em|powering her to receive
whatever he had of mine, and out of my two Guineas paid her one. She laid out
two Guineas, took the Goods into her own Hands, and, e'er &s;he came Home, took
out a Writ again&s;t me, for the Money &s;he had paid for them.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="226">This was on a <HI>Friday</HI>; it rained
exce&s;|ce&s;&s;ively all Day, to which I attributed both her &s;taying, and
the extreme Low|ne&s;s and Dejection of Spirit I laboured un|der: I called to
Mrs. <HI>Craggs</HI> to bear me Company; but, as &s;he had told my Chri|&s;tian
Name to my Landlady, in order to have me properly arre&s;ted, &s;he did not
think convenient to come to me.</P>
<P>At length the old Beldam returned, and, in a merry way, a&s;ked
me, Did not I think &s;he had run away with my things? I an&s;wered,
no&mdash;they were not worth her while. She complained of being very dry; upon
which I was weak enough to treat her with &s;ome Porter.</P>
<P>My Reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, I was at this time employed
in writing a Tragedy, called, <HI>The Roman Father,</HI> from the Story of
<HI>Virginius</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> two Acts of which I had fini&s;hed;
but, as at the &s;ame time there were two bad Plays wrote on that Subject, I
did not think pro|per to go on with it; it was lying on my Window; and after
&s;ome Chat with the <PB N="220" REF="227"> old Woman, being very much
depre&s;&s;ed in Spirit, I went to Bed.</P>
<P>Early next Morning, to my no &s;mall Surprize, entered a Couple of
ill-favoured Fellows, the Sight of whom &s;truck Terror to my Soul. I demanded
their Bu&s;ine&s;s; one of them an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">"Get up, you <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;t Bitch, and
come along with us."</Q> The other, who had employed him&s;elf in looking over
my Papers, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Whore, here is
&s;omething a|bout &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Father, that's the Pope, and be damn'd
to you, is it?"</Q> I was for &s;ome time quite &s;peechle&s;s, but, when I
recovered Strength enough to &s;peak, I begged of them to leave the Room, till
I put on my Clothes; but my Landlady coming in at that in&s;tant, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"You're damn'd mode&s;t;&mdash;don't quit the
Place:"</Q> The Fellows, who had more Decency than &s;he, looked out at the
Window, while I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, in which Time my Agony was inconceivable;
they called a Coach, and thru&s;ting me into it, conveyed me to the Hou&s;e of
an Officer of Mace at <HI>Cha|ring-cro&s;s</HI>; as I happened to have a
Gui|nea <PB N="221" REF="228"> in my Pocket, I called for a Room and a Pint of
Wine, and then con&s;idered, if I had one Friend I could apply to: My dear Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI> was out of Town, as were likewi&s;e mo&s;t of the Nobility;
however, I &s;aw young Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> go by the Window, and &s;ent to him,
but like all the World, when he heard my Condition, he would not come near me.
My whole Debt was Forty Shillings; O, what could I do but give my Tears Vent!
which was my only Relief; and next Day, after paying twenty Shillings, I was
conveyed to the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea</HI> Pri&s;on. I &s;at within&s;ide of the
Lodge for &s;ome Minutes quite &s;tupified; till at length a Man came, and
a&s;ked me, if I was a Pri&s;oner, which, it &s;eems, he did not be|fore know;
I told him I was, upon which he brought me into a Room, where a Par|cel of
Wretches &s;eized me, and &s;ung a long Song about Garni&s;h, and were going to
pull my Clothes off, till a Servant, who had &s;een me before, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"For God's &s;ake don't u&s;e Dr. <HI>Meade</HI>'s
Wife ill:"</Q> Upon this a mo&s;t ugly Woman came up, and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"G&mdash;d d&mdash;n you, you B&mdash;h, do you 
<PB N="222" REF="229"> pretend to be Dr. <HI>Meade</HI>'s Wife?&mdash;I am his
Wife."</Q> I begged to be heard, which was granted; I told her my Name was
<HI>Meade,</HI> and my Hu&s;band a Clergy|man in <HI>Ireland.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, that's a different Ca&s;e, &s;aid &s;he,
going off."</Q> They were kind enough to take my Word for &s;ome Drink; and a
good decent Woman &s;aid, &s;he would accept of me for a Chum, as they call it.
She brought me into a little dirty Apartment, where, without examin|ing any
thing, I in De&s;pair threw my&s;elf down on a Bed I &s;aw there, and
re&s;olved never to ri&s;e again. Three Days and Nights pa&s;t, during which
Time I never ta&s;ted Food of any &s;ort. At length the Companion of my
Mi&s;ery pre&s;&s;ed me to take a little Refre&s;hment, which I was
per|&s;uaded do; and &s;eeing &s;o many People in my own Condition, at length
reconciled me to think of making my&s;elf as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible; and leave
my&s;elf to the Di&s;po&s;i|tion of Divine Providence. One Morning a Friend
came to vi&s;it me, by whom I &s;ent a Letter to Dr. <HI>M&mdash;de,</HI>
telling him my Di&s;tre&s;s, and, among other Things, the&s;e Lines: 
<Q><PB N="223" REF="230"> 
<L>CAN, alas! the plaintive Pray'r,</L>

<L>Sympathize while I impart</L> 
<L>Such Affliction, as before</L> 
<L>Never haple&s;s Woman bore.</L></Q></P>
<P>I made no doubt but I &s;hould be re|lieved, and waited
impatiently for the An|&s;wer, which was as follows:

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have &s;o many Applications for Cha|rity, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible for me to re|lieve all; tho&s;e from your Country alone are very
numerous: The Family of the <HI>Meades</HI> there are very rich, and &s;hould

<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Your humble Servant, <HI>R.

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231">I kept the Original of this by me, with a
Re&s;olution, when I &s;hould the&s;e unlucky Deeds relate, not to omit it.
This was &s;oon gone, I had many to &s;atisfy: I then wrote to <HI>Henry
Furne&s;e,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who in a polite manner &s;ent me a Guinea,
which doubled the Obligation; 
<Q> 
<L>For, oh! believe me, 'tis a dreadful Task,</L> 
<L>To generous Minds, to be compell'd to ask;</L> 
<L>More dreadful &s;till to have a Suit deny'd,</L> 
<L>Or take a niggard Alms, giv'n with Con|tempt and
Pride.</L></Q> I was by this &s;upported till my dear Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> came
to Town, who was no &s;ooner acquainted with my Misfortune, than he &s;ent me a
Guinea all changed into Six-pences, le&s;t it &s;hould tempt &s;ome one to pick
my Pocket; this was an In&s;tance of &s;ingular Humanity; but he has often
&s;aid, when he did good to People in Di&s;tre&s;s, it was only to ea&s;e his
own Mind, which would other|wi&s;e have been on the Rack: Oh, Heavens! what
innate Goodne&s;s mu&s;t dwell in that Brea&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232">Seeing the Woman, that accu&s;ed me for
being the Doctor's Wife, lying dead drunk in the Puddle, I a&s;ked my
Companion, who &s;he was? Madam, I'll tell you, &s;aid &s;he: She was a Servant
to Dr. <HI>M&mdash;de,</HI> who had a Child by her, and &s;upported her in his
Hou&s;e for &s;ome time; at length they parted, and he was to allow her five
Guineas a Week: But the Doctor marry|ing his pre&s;ent Lady, began to be
remi&s;s in his Payments, which enraged Madam to &s;uch a Degree, that,
forgetting Decency, &s;he went to his Hou&s;e, and, in Pre&s;ence of all his
Servants, abu&s;ed and expo&s;ed him to the utmo&s;t of her power.</P>
<P>Upon this the Doctor &s;tepped into his Chariot, and ordered it to
drive to her Lodging, where finding &s;he was indebted to her Landlord, one Mr.
<HI>Brad&s;t&mdash;t,</HI> famous for being a Spy for the D&mdash; of
<HI>C&mdash;,</HI> he de&s;ired him to arre&s;t, and put her in Jail. This
artful Fellow al|ledged, it would be very expen&s;ive; but the Doctor having
Charity-money enough to &s;upply &s;uch Exigencies, &s;aid, he valued not the
Expence, &s;o &s;he was &s;ecured. Upon <PB N="226" REF="233"> this the poor
Wretch was arre&s;ted, and thrown into Jail; and from time to time
<HI>Brad&s;t&mdash;t</HI> got three hundred Pounds of the Doctor for keeping
her there; till at length the Doctor growing weary of the Expence, con&s;ented
to her Relea&s;ement; but &s;he had &s;o entirely devoted her&s;elf to
drinking, that &s;he died a few Days after &s;he obtained her Liberty.</P>
<P>And &s;o let this be booked among other of his good Works, &s;uch
as combing the Ladies Heads, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think it is a great Pity that every cha|ritably di&s;po&s;ed
Per&s;on is not his own Al|moner, &s;ince it is a thou&s;and to one, whe|ther
that which was intended to help the Di&s;tre&s;t and Innocent, is not applied
to the Service of LUXURY and VICE! I am &s;ure, to my own Knowledge, in
&s;everal In&s;tances it has been &s;o by the D-ct-r, who has many Affairs of
the &s;ame Nature on his Hands; and, to quote his favourite Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Now, in &s;uch Exigencies, not to need,</L> 
<L>Upon my Word, you mu&s;t be rich indeed,</L> 
<L><PB N="227" REF="234">A noble Superfluity it craves,</L> 
<L>Not for your&s;elf, but for your Whores and
Knaves!</L></Q></P>
<P>I remember, twenty Years ago, to have heard Dr. <HI>Delany</HI>
&s;ay from the Pulpit, it was a glorious thing for a Man to be his own
EXECUTOR: I dare &s;ay, he never preached but what he practi&s;ed; and, ex|cept
that eternal Trea&s;ure, which he has wi&s;ely laid up in &s;tore, where
neither Moth nor Ru&s;t can corrupt, nor Thieves break thro' and &s;teal:
Whenever he comes to pay his Mortal Debt&mdash;which Hour be far
away!&mdash;all he will have left on this &s;ide of a ble&s;&s;ed and glorious
Immortality, will be a Shower of Orphans and of Wi|dows Tears, to bedew the
con&s;ecrated Earth, where his honoured Remains &s;hall re&s;t in Peace, till
&s;ummoned to partake of that Bli&s;s, prepared by the Almighty be|fore all
Worlds, for Souls like his.</P>
<P>As I have frequently ob&s;erved to my Readers, that I was glad to
run away from &s;uch a di&s;agreeable Theme as my Misfor|tunes, I hope for
their Pardon, though I <PB N="228" REF="235"> am obliged to return to them
again, and give them an Account even of &s;o di&s;mal a Place as a Jail.</P>
<P>Our Head-Turnkey happened to have been a Servant to Alderman
<HI>Barber</HI>; and, like <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> I found Favour in the Sight of my
Keeper, as he had &s;een me in better Days. 
<Q> 
<L>For, <HI>Certes,</HI> I had look'd on better Days,</L> 
<L>And had with holy Bell been knoll'd to Church,</L> 
<L>And &s;at at good Men's Fea&s;ts, and wip'd the Eye</L> 
<L>Of Drops, which &s;acred Pity had en|gender'd.</L></Q> This
Man took great Compa&s;&s;ion on me, and as on every <HI>Friday,</HI> which is
Court-day, the Pri&s;oners are all locked up in their re|&s;pective Apartments,
le&s;t, when the Gates are thrown open for the Admi&s;&s;ion of the Judge and
Lawyers, any of them &s;hould make their E&s;cape: I was always indul|ged in
the Liberty of hearing the Trials, which, as a Court of Judicature was a 
<PB N="229" REF="236"> Scene I had never before beheld, greatly amu&s;ed
me.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I quickly perceived Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> was
not mi&s;taken, when he &s;aid the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Excellence of a
Lawyer was Tautology.</P>
<P>Yet this was but a tran&s;itory Relaxation, once in a Week; the
Horror of my Con|dition returned with double Violence the Moment I heard the
Key turn for my Con|finement.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> &s;hould alledge, that I have been
&s;evere on him in my Writings; let him but con&s;ider, the Extremity that he
drove a worthy Gentleman's Daughter to, nurtured in Ea&s;e and Plenty: and if
he does not acquit me, I am &s;ure the re&s;t of the World will.</P>
<P>We had a &s;ort of a Chappel belonging to the Jail, where Dr.
<HI>Friend,</HI> a Clergy|man, Brother to Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> the Phy&s;ician,
obliged us with Divine Service every <HI>Sun|day:</HI> This Gentleman was
him&s;elf a Pri|&s;oner in the <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> and, after all the
Grandeur he had once lived in, was now &s;o low reduced, as even to be beholden
<PB N="230" REF="237"> to &s;uch an unfortunate Creature as I for Sixpence;
which, unfortunate as I was, I could not refu&s;e to &s;o fine an Orator, a
G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntleman! and, by all Accounts,
only undone by boundle&s;s Genero&s;ity and Ho&s;|pital<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Day I heard him preach I was charmed with his
Elocution, but the re&s;t of the Congregation, mad and drunk, bade him hold his
Tongue;&mdash;he indeed, like <HI>Orpheus,</HI> played to Wolves and Bears; nor
were they half &s;o obliging to him, as the Storms were to <HI>Arion</HI>;
neither could he, though uttering dulcet and harmonious Sounds, make the rude
Crowd grow civil with his Song.</P>
<P>This fine Gentleman I often invited to my lonely
Man&s;ion&mdash;he was not a lit|tle &s;urpri&s;ed to hear my mournful
Story;&mdash;and indeed it &s;omewhat alleviated my Sorrow to find &s;uch a
Companion:&mdash;Poor Gentleman! Death has relea&s;ed him; I am &s;ure I
&s;hould have done it, had the Almighty given me a Power equal to my
Inclination to &s;erve him.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">However I may prai&s;e God that I was, under
him, the happy In&s;trument of Good to Numbers of my wretched
Fellow-crea|tures, &s;ince by one pathetic Memorial I wrote for them, the
&s;orrowful Sighing of the Pri&s;oners reached the Hearts of the Le|gi&s;lative
Powers, and obtained an Act of Grace for them.</P>
<P>But as it was now near <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and the Act was not
to take Place till the <HI>June</HI> following, I u&s;ed my utmo&s;t Endeavours
to procure my own Liberty; for, oh! what anxious Moments mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed
between that dreadful Interval of Time? On a &s;e|cond Application to Mr.
<HI>Cibber,</HI> he u&s;ed all his Power with the Great for me, and, as he had
been u&s;ed to move their Pa&s;&s;ions, did it effectually on my Behalf,
in&s;omuch than no le&s;s than &s;ixteen Dukes contributed a Guinea a-piece
towards my Enlargement.</P>
<P>When I read over the&s;e Words, <HI>Di&s;charge from your
Cu&s;tody the Body of,</HI> &amp;c. as I was by nine Weeks Confinement,
Sickne&s;s, and Fa&s;ting, rendered quite weak, the joy|ful Surpri&s;e made me
faint away &s;everal Times, and indeed, my kind Benefactor 
<PB N="232" REF="239"> had like to have fru&s;trated his own gene|rous De&s;ign
of pre&s;erving me.</P>
<P>However, after all Debts, Extortions, and Dues were paid, I had
ju&s;t thirteen Shillings left, with which Sum I was once more permitted to
breathe the open Air&mdash;and go where I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I got as far as <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> I found my
Head turn quite giddy, and my Legs fail me, in&s;omuch that I went into a
Jeweller's Shop, who perceiving my weak Condition, permitted me to &s;it down
in it; I begged of him to let &s;ome of his Servants call a Coach for me, which
he civilly complied with; when I was got into it, I was at a Lo&s;s where to
bid the Coachman drive me; till at la&s;t recollecting, that all my Writings,
All, the little all! which might make my fu|ture Fortune, were in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. <HI>Trifoli,</HI> the Woman who had ca&s;t me into
Mi&s;ery un&s;peakable, which, not to teize my Readers, I have &s;lightly
pa&s;&s;ed over: for what Entertainment can it po&s;&s;ibly give to the
curious, learned, or polite Reader to hear from me what every 
<PB N="233" REF="240"> Per&s;on, who has ever been in a Jail, can relate as
well as I.</P>
<P>Well, I was carried to her Hou&s;e, where, as I told her, I did
not know where to lodge that Night; &s;he kindly accepted of me for a
Bedfellow, but a very bad one I found, for &s;he, as my Spirits were quite
fatigued, no &s;ooner found I was fa&s;t a&s;leep, but &s;he picked my
Pocket.</P>
<P>When I awoke in the Morning, &s;he asked me to give her &s;ome
Tea, on which taking up my Pocket to give her Money to go for it, I found I had
none; when I complained of this U&s;age, &s;he told me &s;he was too charitable
to permit me to &s;leep with her, and now this was her Reward; &s;o &s;he
in&s;i&s;ted on my turning out of her Doors, and truly I knew not where to 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Inform my unacquainted Feet</L> 
<L>Thro' the blind Mazes of a tangled World;</L></Q> So I went
dirty, as I came out of Jail, to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>; for I ought before to
have ob&s;erved, that this Wretch not only &s;ecured my Per&s;on, but my
Clothes al&s;o, in&s;omuch that I had not a Shift to change me, till, 
<PB N="234" REF="241"> out of what Charity was &s;ent me, I bought a &s;econd
one in the Jail.</P>
<P>However, he received me with as much Regard and Kindne&s;s, as
though I had been ever &s;o well dre&s;t; but he charged me not to give him
Thanks for any Thing he had done to &s;erve me, but to prai&s;e God, who, as he
&s;aid, had given me Me|rit; 
<Q REND="inline">"For, Child, &s;aid he, were you &s;tupid,
in&s;en&s;ible, or wicked, I &s;hould never have had the &s;malle&s;t
Compa&s;&s;ion for you."</Q></P>
<P>He asked me what I now intended to do? I a&s;&s;ured him I did not
know; for that I neither had a Lodging, nor, what was yet wor&s;e, a Shilling
to get one; 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;aid he, I have a little Money in Store
for you; I told your melancholy Story to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and he
gave me Five Guineas for you; there they are."</Q></P>
<P>This was a Lottery Prize to one in my unhappy Situation; I could
not, though prohibited, forbear the warme&s;t Expre&s;|&s;ions of Gratitude,

<P>My dear old Friend was plea&s;ed with my Sen&s;e of his Goodne&s;s
to me; only he told <PB N="237" REF="244"> me, my Lines were more proper to be
ad|dre&s;&s;ed to an Archbi&s;hop than to him, who had nothing to boa&s;t of
more than a little common Humanity.</P>
<P>Well, being now free,&mdash;and with five Guineas in my Pocket, in
flowing Circum|&s;tances, I began to con&s;ider, in what Man|ner I &s;hould
improve them; &s;o I wrote to his Grace of <HI>M&mdash;h,</HI> who, like Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> knows not how to give one Guinea by way of Relief, he
immediately &s;ent me Ten, &s;ealed up in a very genteel Letter, with his
be&s;t Wi&s;hes and Compli|ments to me: who was now &s;o rich as I?</P>
<P>But, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q> 
<L>There is a Tide in the Affairs of Men,</L> 
<L>Which taken at the Height, is pro&s;pe|rous;</L> 
<L>But, &s;lighted, the Re&s;idue of their Lives</L> 
<L>Is bound in Shallows and in Mi&s;cry.</L></Q> So I ju&s;t then
heard a Clergyman was in <HI>England,</HI> who was a near and intimate Friend
of my Father's; him I addre&s;&s;ed, and was ordered to go to Mr.
<HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> <PB N="238" REF="245"> a Printer, in
<HI>Sali&s;bury-court,</HI> for an An|&s;wer to my Letter.</P>
<P>As I had never formed any great Idea of a 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mem.</HI> Not our pre&s;ent Set of
Printers, who are many of them Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons in good
Cir|cum&s;tances, prrticularly my own.</NOTE>Printer, by tho&s;e I had &s;een
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I was very negligent of my Dre&s;s, any more than making
my&s;elf clean; but was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, when I was directed to a
Hou&s;e of a very grand outward Ap|pearance, and had it been a Palace, the
beneficent Ma&s;ter de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>I met a very civil Reception from him; and he not only made me
break|fa&s;t, but al&s;o dine with him, and his agree|able Wife and Children.
After Dinner he called me into his Study, and &s;hewed me an Order he had
received to pay me twelve Guineas, which he immediately took out of his
E&s;crutore, and put it into my Hand; but when I went to tell them over, I
found I had fourteen, and &s;uppo|&s;ing the Gentleman had made a Mi&s;take, I
was for returning two of them; but he, <PB N="239" REF="246"> with a
Sweetne&s;s and Mode&s;ty almo&s;t pe|culiar to him&s;elf, &s;aid, he hoped I
would not take it ill, that he had pre&s;umed to add a Trifle to the Bounty of
my Friend.</P>
<P>I really was confounded, till, recollecting that I had read
<HI>Pamela,</HI> and been told it was written by one Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI>
I a&s;ked him, whether he was not the Au|thor of it? He &s;aid, he was the
Editor: I told him, my Surprize was now over, as I found he had only given to
the incompa|rable <HI>Pamela</HI> the Virtues of his own worthy Heart.</P>
<P>When he reads the&s;e Lines, as read them I am certain he will,
even for the Writer's &s;ake, let him reflect, that, at lea&s;t, his Bread was
not &s;cattered on the Water; but that though I have no other Way of &s;hewing
my Gratitude for his boundle&s;s and repeated Acts of Humanity to me, and my
Children, but Words, mere Words; yet, if every Word of mine could charm down
Ble&s;&s;ings on him, 
<Q> 
<L>Then never &s;hou'd Misfortune cro&s;s his Foot;</L> 
<L><PB N="240" REF="247">But Peace &s;hou'd be within his Walls
and Plenty,</L> 
<L>Health, and Happine&s;s his con&s;tant
At|tendants.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, that I might, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid the Mi&s;ery of
extreme Want, I re|&s;olved to turn my Stock into Trade; and, after long
Con&s;ideration, thought nothing would &s;uit my Inclination &s;o well as a
Pamphlet-Shop, nor no Place was &s;o pro|per for my Purpo&s;e as <HI>St.
James</HI>'s-<HI>Street,</HI> where I &s;hould be in the Center of my noble
Benefactors; to this end, I walked through it, and finding one to be let, which
an&s;wered my Purpo&s;e, I directly agreed to give the Landlord twenty-one
Pounds a Year, for a Shop, Parlour, and Kitchen; but the Landlord in&s;i&s;ted
upon my paying a Quarter's Rent before-hand, which, though a little hard upon
me, as I not only had the Shop to &s;tock, but Fur|niture of all Kinds to buy,
I complied with.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="248">So, Reader, here was a new Scene, and I, for
the fir&s;t of my Family, took my Place behind a Counter.</P>
<P>Having met with a very great Bargain of Prints, which were &s;old
under Di&s;tre&s;s, and having &s;ome Knowledge in that Way, I re&s;olved
al&s;o to deal in them; &s;o, having decorated out my Windows with them to the
be&s;t Advantage, early on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning I entered on my new
Employ.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on who entered was Lord
<HI>P&mdash;&s;t&mdash;n,</HI> dre&s;s'd <HI>&agrave; la mode de Paris,</HI>
with long &s;loped double Ruffles, &s;uch as the La|dies wear; he took down the
Print of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Monument, and, though it was marked Price
Eighteen-pence, he bade me a Groat for it, which, as it had co&s;t me a
Shilling, I could by no means take; &s;o he went away very much di&s;plea&s;ed,
and truly, I began to be out of Conceit with my Occupation.</P>
<P>As my dear Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> had made me a pre&s;ent of fifty of
his la&s;t An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> I &s;at down to read it, and found it
&s;o full of Spirit and Humour, that ju&s;t as it had thrown me into a hearty
Fit of <PB N="242" REF="249"> Laughter, a Clergyman entered, who a&s;ked me,
what I had got new? I told him <HI>my pre&s;ent Situation</HI>: He looked
earne&s;tly on me, and &s;aid, he was very &s;ure of that; 
<Q REND="inline">"But, Madam, &s;aid he, all are not born to be
happy in this World, however they may merit it, which plainly demon|&s;trates a
future State, where Rewards and Puni&s;hments will be impartially
di&s;|tributed; but why &s;hould I tell this to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI> who
may better in|&s;truct her Teacher?"</Q></P>
<P>I begged of the Gentleman to inform me, where I had had the Honour
of &s;eeing him? He told me, he was Son to Colonel <HI>Stuart,</HI> who lived
next Door to my Father, before I was married, and when he him&s;elf was in the
College: I then recollected, that he u&s;ed every Day to &s;end me &s;ome
poetical Prai&s;e, and as I never before had an Op|portunity of thanking him
for his elegant Compliments, I took it now.</P>
<P>As he was de&s;irous of giving me Han&s;el, as they call it, I
recommended Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Letter to him, as a Cure for the Spleen, a
Di&s;temper mo&s;t &s;tudious and learned Per|&s;ons <PB N="243" REF="250"> are
apt to fall into; he took the Gho&s;t's Word for the Excellence of the
Performance, and gave me a Guinea; I was going to give him Change, but he would
not accept of it; &s;o, promi&s;ing to be a con&s;tant Cu&s;tomer for whatever
I &s;old, and wi&s;hing me all Succe&s;s, he de|parted. <HI>Mem.</HI> The
Clergyman infinitely more generous than the Peer.</P>
<P>As my Obligations to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> were ever pre&s;ent to my
Mind, I wrote to him the following kind of Paraphra&s;e on an Ode of
<HI>Horace:</HI>

<P><PB N="245" REF="252">I &s;ent the&s;e Lines to my dear Gentleman,
who pre&s;ently came to me, as I was once more in his Neighbourhood,&mdash;and
in his chearful way, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Faith, Child, you have prai&s;ed me &s;o, that, I
think, it is the lea&s;t I can do to make you eat for a
Fortnight;"</Q>&mdash;&s;o he gave me three Guineas.</P>
<P>As my Mind was now a little at Peace, I began to think of my dear
Children, whom nothing but my Incapacity of doing them Service, and a
Suppo&s;ition that their Father took proper Care of them, could ever divert my
Thoughts from, even a Moment; &s;o &s;trong is maternal Love, at lea&s;t, if
every Mother loves like me: For, really, and I hope it is a pardonable
Frail|ty, my very Life is trea&s;ured in him, whom I may properly &s;tile my
only Child, and were he to die I &s;hould not long &s;ur|vive him.</P>
<P>I know not of what impenetrable Stuff his Father's Heart was made
of, that could let &s;uch a Son, not only want the Advan|tages of Education,
which had it not been <PB N="246" REF="253"> in his Power to pay for it, it was
in his own Power to be&s;tow on him, &s;o far as in&s;tructing him in the
Knowledge of <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> which <HI>Cato</HI> would not
permit his Son to be indebted to a Slave for;&mdash;and yet <HI>Cato</HI> was,
at lea&s;t, as good, and a much greater Man than the Par&s;on; &s;urely this he
might have done:&mdash;No; on the contrary, he cho&s;e to expo&s;e him, at Nine
Years of Age, to every Calamity in Life; and that he did not turn Thief or
Pickpocket, was due to God's re&s;training Grace, and providential Care of
him.</P>
<P>And here, I mu&s;t, in Vindication of my Child, declare, he never
was undutiful or di&s;re&s;pectful to me, as his Father has fal&s;ly and
cruelly reported; he is, like all Per|&s;ons of his Age, &s;o full of Mirth and
over|flowing Spirits, that, I am certain, the Dulne&s;s his Father brings, as
an Excu&s;e for taking him from School, never was his Fault;</P>
<P>For he is&mdash; 
<Q><PB N="247" REF="254"> 
<L>All my Mirth, my Exerci&s;e, my Matter,</L> 
<L>He makes my <HI>July</HI>'s Days &s;hort as
<HI>De|cember,</HI></L> 
<L>And, with his varying Playfulne&s;s, kills in me</L> 
<L>Thoughts which would thick my Blood.</L></Q> Though, I am
&s;ure, only that he has too much Re&s;pect for his Father, to throw any
Reflection on him; yet he might properly &s;ay, 
<Q>He let me feed with his Hinds, debar'd me of a Place in his
Love, and, as much as was in him, mined my Gentility by ba&s;e Education.</Q>
And I may &s;ay, with Truth, the Boy is gentle, though 
<Q> 
<L>Never &s;chool'd, learn'd; full of noble Device,</L> 
<L>And of all Sorts enchantingly belov'd.</L> 
<BIBL>Shake&s;pear, As you like it.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="255">But to return. I wrote to <HI>Ireland</HI>
to my elde&s;t Son, who, either through Fear of his Father's Anger, or an
ill-natur'd Spirit derived from him, did not think me worth an An&s;wer;
however, he &s;hewed the Letter to his Si&s;ter, who, in her low Stile, &s;ent
me an affectionate Letter. Before it reached me, I heard Mr.
<HI>Ar&mdash;e</HI> was come to <HI>London,</HI> and having been told my Child
was bound Apprentice to him, I did not doubt but I &s;hould find him with him,
&s;o I went to wait on him; he received me very politely, and told me, my Son
had left him, and was gone to <HI>Scotland:</HI> When I demanded, how they came
to part? He &s;aid, he had pawned &s;ome of his Mu&s;ic Books, and that he had
complained to his Father of him, who a&s;ked what they might be worth? It is to
be pre&s;umed that they were valued to the utmo&s;t they co&s;t; upon which Mr.
<HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> ever tender, &s;aid he was glad to hear that the Theft, as
he termed it, amounted to Death, intreating Mr. <HI>Ar&mdash;e</HI> to
pro&s;ecute the Child, for &s;uch he then was, and declaring that no|thing in
the World would give him greater Satis|faction <PB N="249" REF="256"> than to
hear that the Dog was hang'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ar&mdash;e</HI> &s;aid, Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s
In|humanity quite &s;hocked him,&mdash;&s;o he corrected the Boy very
&s;everely, upon which he ran away from him; that he had &s;ince received a
Letter from him, which he &s;hewed to me, and from thence I got a Direction
where to write to him. I was, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, infinitely di&s;turbed at
this Account of my Son; I wrote to him that very Night, and informed him of
what Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> had &s;aid; I begged of him to come to me, and that
as his Ma&s;ter had highly commended his mu&s;ical Talents, I hoped, by Mr.
<HI>Cibber</HI>'s Intere&s;t, to get him engaged at one of the Theatres.</P>
<P>About ten Days after, having ju&s;t paid my Rent, and bought
&s;ome Shop-Goods, on which I had laid out every Penny I was worth;&mdash;as I
had &s;tuck up on my Shop Window, <HI>Letters written here on any Subject,
except the Law, Price Twelve-pence; Petitions al&s;o drawn at the &s;ame
Rate.</HI> Mem. <HI>Ready Money, no Tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="257">A Man came in, very badly dre&s;t, with a
grea&s;y Leather Apron before him; he looked over &s;ome Prints, when the
Po&s;t|man brought me a large Pacquet, marked <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; as I had no
Money, I was in terrible Confu&s;ion, e&s;pecially as the Fellow cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, Mi&s;tre&s;s, don't keep me waiting;"</Q> I
&s;aid, I mu&s;t &s;end out for Change: Oh, &s;aid he, I never go without it;
where's your Piece? Upon this, the Leather-apron'd Gentleman, for &s;uch he
was, drew out a Handful of Gold, and throwing down a Guinea, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"There, take your Money;"</Q> and what was yet
more &s;urprizing, he in&s;i&s;ted on my taking the Change, for he determined,
he &s;aid, to have me his Debtor.</P>
<P>Upon this I began to have a very different Opinion of my new
Cu&s;tomer than what his fir&s;t Appearance gave me, and therefore civilly
entreated his Permi&s;&s;ion to peru&s;e my Letter, to which he agreeing, I had
not read above ten Lines when I bur&s;t into Tears, &s;o the Gentleman
in&s;i&s;ted on my laying it a&s;ide while he &s;tayed, telling me, 
<PB N="251" REF="258"> I mu&s;t &s;o far oblige him as to write a Love-Letter
for him.</P>
<P>Upon this I invited him into the Parlour, and told him, he mu&s;t
make me his Confi|dant: He &s;aid, he had never mentioned Love to the Lady;
that, as to her Per&s;on, &s;he was very agreeable, but that her Mind far
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed it: So, having my In&s;truc|tions, I quickly fini&s;hed my
Ta&s;k greatly to his Satisfaction, in&s;omuch that he pro|te&s;ted I mu&s;t
give him Leave to &s;end for a Fla&s;k of <HI>Champaigne</HI> to rai&s;e my
Spirits, which, indeed, were greatly oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>By the time he had drank a Gla&s;s or two, he began to talk of
<HI>Homer, Horace, Milton,</HI> and all the Poets; &s;ung an <HI>Italian</HI>
Song; and &s;oon convinced me, that Dre&s;s was put on merely to di&s;gui&s;e a
fine Gen|tleman, which it was no way in his Power to do; I told him &s;o, and
a&s;ked him, why he walked in Ma&s;querade?</P>
<P>He &s;miled at my Que&s;tion, but a&s;&s;ured me, he was neither
better or wor&s;e than a Hou&s;e-Painter, and that his Name was <HI>Tom
Bru&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="259">This put me in Mind of an Adventure I once
had in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when one of the fine&s;t Gentlemen in it came to
vi&s;it me in a Grazier's Coat, and told me his Name was <HI>Tom Long,</HI> the
Carrier, though he hap|pened to be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Baronet, with a large
E&s;tate, and a great Employment.</P>
<P>But I have been a Lady of Adventure, and almo&s;t every Day of my
Life produces &s;ome new one: I am &s;ure, I ought to thank my loving Hu&s;band
for the Opportunity he has afforded me of &s;eeing the World from the Palace to

re&s;ted contented with my humble Situation, and, in&s;tead of u&s;ing a Pen,
been employed with a Needle, to work for the little ones we might, by this
time, have had.</P>
<P>Now, after all my &s;trange Vici&s;&s;itudes of good and evil
Fortune, I &s;incerely de|clare, that were I to have my Wi&s;h, tho' I &s;hould
not now in the Decline of Life be able to &s;truggle through Misfortunes, as in

put me to School to, when the good old Man was dead, would have taught for me
nothing) would <PB N="255" REF="262"> he permit me to go School, becau&s;e one
Day a Boy threw a Stone at me, and I throwing another at him, happened to break
a Pane of Gla&s;s in an Alehou&s;e Window, for which the People followed me
home, and made my Father pay a Groat for it.</P>
<P>Upon this I received a mo&s;t inhuman Correction from him,
which was repeated every Morning and Night for &s;ix Days to|gether; he
&s;tripped off all my Clothes, though in the Depth of Winter, and locked them
up, leaving me without any Covering but my Shirt in the dark Back Kitchen,
which, as you may remember, was in the Winter overflowed with Water, charging
the Servants not to give me a Mor&s;el of Food; and that I am alive is due to
God's Providence, who, I hope, pre&s;erved me to be a Comfort to you.</P>
<P>However the Servants, though they had but a Groat a Day
allowed them to live upon, u&s;ed to give me Share of their Bread and
Butter-Milk, and, when my Father was abroad, would permit me to warm my Body at
the Kitchen Fire; nay, and as my Father &s;aid, it was too much Indulgence 
<PB N="256" REF="263"> for me to &s;leep with his Footman, the poor Fellow
u&s;ed to let me lie down in the Day, where I &s;pent mo&s;t of my Time, and
was neither allowed Pen, Ink, or Book to a|mu&s;e me.</P>
<P>I will in &s;ome time give you a full Hi&s;|tory; but, at
pre&s;ent, &s;hall confine my|&s;elf to Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI>'s Affair. I
lived with him &s;ome time before I was bound Ap|prentice, in which I was
u&s;ed very well; but as &s;oon as that was done the Scene was changed. Mrs.
<HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> who was prodi|giou&s;ly fond of Gin, u&s;ed to take &s;o
much of it, that &s;he &s;eldom knew what &s;he did, and would often per&s;uade
her Husband to believe well or ill of me, ju&s;t as &s;he was drunk or &s;ober:
It was in one of the&s;e Fits &s;he was when <HI>Tommy L&mdash;e</HI> landed,
who is really a worthle&s;s conceited Fellow; and becau&s;e he thought I did
not &s;ufficiently admire his fine &s;inging, u&s;ed, by way of Fun, to &s;et
Mrs. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> on to abu&s;e me and Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> who is
really a good-natured Man. I was di&s;charged from fetching Half-quarterns to
my Mi&s;tre&s;s; and there being an old Box in the Garret, in which 
<PB N="257" REF="264"> Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> kept &s;ome Mu&s;ick-Books, &s;he
went up to examine it, and &s;aid there were &s;ome of them &s;tole: He, who
did not know what number of Books there was in it, &s;aid, there was none gone;
upon which, without the lea&s;t Ceremony, &s;he &s;truck him in the Face,
&s;wearing by the great God, if he did not correct me, &s;he would do it
her&s;elf. I, who was not far off, and heard this Di&s;cour&s;e, made the
be&s;t of my way out of the Hou&s;e; which Mrs. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> taking as a
Proof of Guilt, and a villai|nous Maid &s;he had joining with her, &s;he
&s;earched the Hou&s;e, and &s;wore &s;he had lo&s;t many things, as Bra&s;s
Candle&s;ticks, Bottles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all this poor Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI>
was obliged to agree to for Quietne&s;s &s;ake. When I had &s;taid a Day away,
I wrote to him, telling him, I was &s;urprized at his Su&s;pi|cions of me, and
that I was willing to re|turn: He came directly with the Me&s;&s;en|ger, and
brought me home. I &s;tayed there till Night, when Mr. <HI>L&mdash;e</HI>
com|ing in, and hearing I was there, called for his Hor&s;ewhip, and Mr.
<HI>A&mdash;e,</HI> his Wife, and <HI>L&mdash;e</HI> were beating me for three 
<PB N="258" REF="265"> Hours, to make me confe&s;s what I had done with the
Books, &s;wearing they would cut me to Death, if I did not own. I was forced
one time to &s;ay that I &s;old them; another, that I gave them away, to get a
little Re&s;pite; &s;o, when they had made me confe&s;s to what they plea&s;ed,
I was put to Bed, and locked in, in order to be &s;ent to <HI>Newgate</HI> next
Day.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed all Night, never &s;lept, and all the next Day did
not eat a Mor&s;el. In the Evening they were rehear&s;ing <HI>Comus,</HI> when
I &s;hot back the Lock of my Pri&s;on, and finding the other Door open, I took
off my Shoes, and crept down &s;tairs, got to the Street, and run five Streets
Length in my Stockings: What Advantage the Maid might make of finding the Door
open and me gone I know not, as Mrs. <HI>A&mdash;e</HI> &s;aid &s;he had lo&s;t
&s;ome of her Jewels, Things the poor Woman never had in her Life; and &s;o far
I was from a Thought of taking any thing of theirs, that I did not take my Hat,
a Shirt, or any thing el&s;e with me. Now all the Rea&s;on I can ever devi&s;e
for her u&s;ing me &s;o, was, I believe, <PB N="259" REF="266"> becau&s;e I
once &s;aw her and <HI>L&mdash;e</HI> toying on the Bed together. So now, my

</LETTER></P>
<P>This Account of my poor Child's Suf|ferings threw me into what
they call <HI>An Hi&s;terick Cholick,</HI> under which I langui&s;hed many
Days; but my Hour was not yet come, nor had my Sorrows reached their Summit.
But of that in due place.</P>
<P>But to return to my Seat behind the Counter, where I was tolerably
content with my Situation, except for the Concern I felt for my Children, from
whom I could &s;eldom di&s;engage my Thoughts, although the &s;ad Remembrance
grieves my <PB N="260" REF="267"> Soul. I mu&s;t proceed: I went to indulge a
plea&s;ing Fit of Melancholy into <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>Where breathing Paint, and &s;peaking Marbles &s;hew</L> 
<L>What Worthies form the hallow'd Mold below.</L></Q> I wandered
through the Cloy&s;ters, reading the In&s;criptions till it grew du&s;ki&s;h. I
ha&s;tened to the great Gate, but was infi|nitely &s;hocked to find I was
locked into the &s;olitary Man&s;ions of the Dead: I called a|loud to no
purpo&s;e, except to fright my&s;elf with my own Voice, reverborated through 
<Q> 
<L>Long &s;ounding I&s;les, and intermingled Graves.</L></Q> 'Tis
&s;carce in the power of Imagination to paint the Horror which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, e&s;|pecially as, by the Glimp&s;es of the Moon, the
Statues, which had before been Subjects of Amu&s;ement to me, now looked
dread|ful, when each Mole-hill Ant &s;welled to a huge <HI>Olympus</HI>; I knew
not what to do, <PB N="261" REF="268"> but, if po&s;&s;ible, take Sanctuary at
the Altar.</P>
<P>I went up to the Iron Wicket, which opens into that part of the
Abbey where Divine Service is performed, and to my un&s;peakable Happine&s;s,
pulled it open: I thought to &s;it down in one of the Pews till Morning, till,
recollecting the Church was full of Rats, my Terrors were again re|newed, and I
had Inclination to go into the I&s;les, yet, how &s;trong a Pa&s;&s;ion is
Fear? the very Look of them terrified me; till, at length gathering Courage,
even from De|&s;pair, I went to the Communion Table, took off from thence a
Carpet, which co|vered it, and thinking I could no where be &s;o &s;ecure from
tho&s;e Vermin as in the Pulpit, I, with great Difficulty, dragged it up, where
finding al&s;o a Velvet Cu&s;hion, I &s;eated my&s;elf, and laid the Cu&s;hion
un|der my Head, wrapping even my Face up with the Carpet.</P>
<P>I endeavoured all in my Power, by the Force of Rea&s;on and
Religion, to conquer the Terrors which &s;eized me; I reflected that God was
every where, and able to <PB N="262" REF="269"> defend me; that he was not
&s;low to hear, nor impotent to &s;ave; and al&s;o that the Church was
peculiarly under his Care, as con&s;ecrated to Acts of Holine&s;s, and both
relying on his Providence, and commit|ting to his Protection, I found my Mind
as tranquil and compo&s;ed, as if I had been at home in my Bed, and fell into a
deep Sleep: And here, tho' I may be thought whim&s;ical or &s;uper&s;titious
for it, I cannot avoid relating my Dream, produced, no doubt, by the &s;ame Set
of Ideas which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my waking Thoughts, and &s;till held their
place in Sleep.</P>
<P>I imagined my&s;elf to be exactly where I was, and that &s;uddenly
the Graves gave up their mighty dead, who walked in mar|tial Array before me; I
thought, by &s;ome &s;ecret intuitive Knowledge, I became ac|quainted not only
with their Names, but al&s;o with their A&s;pects. Many crowned Heads and
&s;ceptered Hands &s;talked by me in venerable Maje&s;ty: <HI>Henry</HI> V.
clad in Armour, drew in a particular manner my Attention, in&s;omuch that I
could not for|bear ble&s;&s;ing him; I thought he &s;miled, 
<PB N="263" REF="270"> and, with a placid Air, returned my Salu|tation, and
&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have been Great, if, when I had
conquered <HI>France,</HI> I had not married the perfidious Daugh|ter of it,
who at the Age of Thirty-four poi&s;oned me. This Crime of hers has been truly
vi&s;ited on all our unhappy Race, who are now quite extinct."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, Thanks, Gracious Monarch. He di&s;appeared, and two
Per&s;ons &s;truggling for a Diadem next approached. Death, De&s;olation, and
Ruin were &s;pread around them, till at length, a &s;urly-looking Fel|low
de&s;troyed them both, and all their Friends.</P>
<P>I mourned at this &s;ad Scene, when, lo! a Hero appeared, who held
in one Hand red Ro&s;es and white, &s;o blended that they looked lovely to the
Eye; he &s;eemed once or twice to &s;mell to them, when in&s;tantly the Flowers
faded and died, while in their Place, appeared a large Bag of Money.</P>
<P>Next came a &s;quat, &s;quare-faced King, who held in his
right-hand four bloody Heads, one of whom I thought I knew to 
<PB N="264" REF="271"> be that of <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> and the other that of
the Marquis of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;weetly blooming Youth, who&s;e Por|trait was ju&s;t at my
Back in the Pulpit, ap|peared and vani&s;hed like my Dream, out of which I
&s;tartled by the Chimes; finding the Bell tolled Four, and knowing the early
Service did not begin till Six, I once more endeavoured to compo&s;e my&s;elf
to Re&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t rea&s;&s;ume my Dream ju&s;t where it broke off, as it
really occurred to me. A lovely Lady made her Entrance, holding <HI>Plato</HI>
in one Hand, and the Bible in the other; two Men, by Force, put a Crown on her
Head, at which &s;he &s;eemed ter|rified, when immediately came a Woman with a
Countenance like <HI>Maegara,</HI> attended by a Train of Fellows, with Cords,
Axes, and Hatchets, Wheels, and other Imple|ments of Death and Torture, waited
on again by Per&s;ons, who, by their holy Ve&s;tments, I hoped would be, at
lea&s;t hu|mane; but alas! in&s;tead of comforting the lovely Lady, they forced
the above-&s;aid Fury, who &s;eemed for once inclined to pity 
<PB N="265" REF="272"> her, to permit tho&s;e &s;avage and inhuman Butchers to
cut off the lovelie&s;t, the mo&s;t learned Head that ever, from the prime
Creation, adorned a Woman.</P>
<P>But to the un&s;peakable Happine&s;s of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
this dete&s;table Wretch told me, as I thought, that <HI>Philip</HI> of
<HI>Spain</HI> poi|&s;oned her, in Hopes of marrying her Si&s;ter
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> then a Pri&s;oner in the Tower.</P>
<P>I was tired with the&s;e &s;hadowy crowned Heads pa&s;&s;ing by
me, like tho&s;e in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and wi&s;hed to &s;ee the &s;weetly
in&s;pired, Lau|rel-wreathed Poets advance; my Wi&s;h was immediately
gratified, and a merry old Fellow appeared, who was, as it were in Je&s;t,
la&s;hing a whole Swarm of Friars: 
<Q> 
<L>Piec'd, patch'd, and pye-bal'd, lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey
Brothers,</L> 
<L>Bare-headed, &s;leevele&s;s &s;ome, and &s;hirtle&s;s
others.</L> 
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q> And though the Blows were dealt pretty
&s;mart, they affected to &s;mile at them.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="273">Next appeared a Queen, to whom a Gentleman,
with a &s;weet but melancholy Countenance, humbly pre&s;ented a Volume of
inimitable Poetry, as he was the Prince of Poets in his Time: His
<HI>Gloriana</HI> re|ceived it graciou&s;ly, and putting her Hand in her Pocket
gave him a large Bag; I &s;up|po&s;ed it had been filled with Gold, but the
Poet opening it, found nothing in it but Grains, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h as they feed the Hogs with, of which he put a large
Handful into his Mouth, and in&s;tantly dropped down.</P>
<P>The Concern I felt for him awaked me; the Bell tolling for Morning
Prayer, and the Sexton mi&s;&s;ing the Carpet, and &s;uppo|&s;ing the Church
had been robbed, was al|mo&s;t be&s;ide him&s;elf, till I called to him, and
bade him not be frighted, there was nothing gone; the Man &s;tared at me, I
begged him to come and help me down, for I found my&s;elf &s;o weak I could
&s;carce move.</P>
<P>I then told him by what odd Accident I came there: He &s;eemed
amazed that I out|lived it, and &s;wore heartily he would not have been in my
Place for all the World. <PB N="297" REF="274"> I begged of him to get
&s;omebody to call me a Chair; he went him&s;elf for one, and with great
Good-nature, brought from his own Hou&s;e a &s;mall Phial, with &s;ome
Cherry-brandy in it, and a Tea-cup in his Pocket; I am &s;ure I wanted a
Cordial, and there|fore took a little of it, though not with|out obliging him
to accept of Payment for it.</P>
<P>When I returned Home, my Servant, who had &s;at up for me all
Night, was amazed to &s;ee me &s;o pale and dirty, for the old Carpet had
&s;ufficiently &s;oiled my Apparel; but, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould conceive a bad
Opinion of me, I told her where I had been, and went to Bed; I &s;lept for two
Hours, and awoke extremely ill, notwith|&s;tanding which I cleaned my&s;elf,
and went into my Shop.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman, but very gravely dre&s;t, was my fir&s;t
Cu&s;tomer; he a&s;ked me the Price of an old Print in the Window, and &s;eemed
&s;urprized at my a&s;king Half a Crown for it, a&s;&s;uring me it was not
worth a Groat; I &s;aid, I was &s;ure he was too good a Judge not to know the
Value of <PB N="268" REF="275"> any Print taken out of <HI>Montfaucon</HI>'s
An|tiquities: He &s;aid, he wondered why, &s;ince I knew the Value of the
Author, I &s;hould be &s;o ta&s;tele&s;s as to cut one of them out of the Work,
which in many Places &s;erved to illu&s;trate it, particularly in the Medals: I
a&s;&s;ured him I had not done it, but had bought them among&s;t a Number of
others. The Gentleman perceiving I &s;poke very faintly, &s;aid, he believed I
was not well; I a&s;&s;ured him I was &s;o ill, it was with in|finite
Difficulty I &s;poke at all; he demanded of me, who was my Phy&s;ician? I
&s;aid, I had none &s;ince my dear Father died, who was one of the Faculty:
Then, Madam, &s;aid he, allow me to have that Honour; &s;o feeling my Pul&s;e,
he ordered me to be bled, which greatly relieved my poor Head, which, with the
Agitation of Spirit I had &s;uffered over Night, aked ready to &s;plit. As this
Gentleman gave me his Attendance as long as I had the lea&s;t Complaint, I
&s;hould, I think, be highly ungrateful not to acknowledge my Obligation to Dr.
<HI>Law&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">And indeed, I mu&s;t here &s;ay, I never met
with more learned, more generous, or more humane Gentlemen than Phy&s;icians;
yet as no general Rule is without an Excep|tion, Dr.
<HI>W&mdash;lk&mdash;r</HI> refu&s;ed me a Sub|&s;cription, altho' every other
Phy&s;ician had, on my dear Father's Account, relieved his unhappy Family; but
he alledged it would di&s;oblige Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>; I know not but it
might; yet how he came to fear him more than the re&s;t of the World did, that
I know not, but any Excu&s;e will &s;erve a Man to &s;ave five Shillings;
perhaps he could not &s;pare them, as it is more than probable, were he &s;ee'd
according to his Skill, he might not be worth a &s;ingle <HI>Marvedi</HI>; and
for many Rea&s;ons, he ought not to be &s;evere on any Woman's Cha|racter, let
him amend the Females of his own Family fir&s;t, a Ta&s;k, I fear he will never
be able to perform.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o give the &s;ame Advice to Dr. <HI>O&mdash;ns,</HI>
who&s;e two Si&s;ters took a &s;olitary Walk over <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Bridge</HI>
every Evening, perhaps to &s;ay their Prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="277">But to return to <HI>Albion.</HI> I had one
Even|ing been invited abroad, and at my Return, my Servant told me there had
been two very fine Gentlemen to vi&s;it me, who would not leave their Names,
but &s;aid they would come the next Morning. Accord|ingly they did; one of whom
I knew to be Lieutenant <HI>Southwel,</HI> &s;ince dead, and the other the
L&mdash;d V&mdash;t <HI>D&mdash;le</HI>; Mr. <HI>Southwel,</HI> who had been
many Years acquainted with me, &s;eemed rejoiced to &s;ee me, but my Lord
looked on me with the utmo&s;t Contempt, nay, with &s;uch an Air, as I had
never before met with from any Gentleman, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Prithee, come away, I thought you were to take me
to a Girl of Sixteen;"</Q> though, <HI>mem.</HI> he was at that time married to
his pre&s;ent Lady, who is, by all Accounts, a very great Beauty: I a&s;&s;ured
his Lord&s;hip I had been once Sixteen, but as it happened &s;ix|teen Years had
rolled over &s;ince that bloom|ing Sea&s;on, and that, to my great
Morti|fication, I could not arre&s;t old Father <HI>Time:</HI> Mr.
<HI>Southwel</HI> very politely &s;aid, I &s;hould be always young; but my Lord
<PB N="271" REF="278"> urging his Departure, he whi&s;pered me, that he would
come and pa&s;s the Evening with me.</P>
<P>He kept his Word, and gave me a long Detail of the Calamities he
had &s;uffered on Board a Man-of-War, where, becau&s;e &s;ome &s;aucy Fellow
called him a <HI>Ba&s;tard,</HI> and he in Return, broke his Head, the Captain
confined him &s;ixteen Weeks to his Cabin; but learning that he was very ill,
he per|mitted him to come upon Deck; he was &s;upported by two Men, weak, cold,
and trembling, as he a&s;&s;ured me, and ready to faint, &s;o that he was
obliged to &s;it down; upon which the Captain demanded how he dare to &s;it
down in his Pre&s;ence, or to wear his Hat? &s;o he fir&s;t knocked it off, and
then threw it into the Sea.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indignities, &s;aid he, &s;o highly provoked me, that I
retired to my Cabin, re&s;olved, if ever I &s;et my foot on Shore, to call the
Captain to an Account for them. Accordingly, as &s;oon as we were on
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, I challenged him, for which Of|fence I was mulcted
eighteen Months pay; &s;o here is the Hi&s;tory of poor <HI>Dick</HI> for
you.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="279">I was &s;en&s;ibly touched with his
Narra|tion, and could not help reflecting how ter|ribly it mu&s;t be to
Gentlemen of Family and Education, to bear with In&s;ults from Wretches &s;o
far beneath them, as tho&s;e Marine Commanders frequently are, who are perhaps
advanced for being abject, and no &s;ooner are they advanced, but they be|come
in&s;olent Tyrants.</P>
<P>And indeed, I believe this is eternally the Ca&s;e; for it is a
con&s;tant Remark, that the wor&s;t Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, are tho&s;e
who have been Servants them&s;elves; they know what Frauds they have committed
when in the like Situation, and con&s;e|quently pry into &s;uch low Affairs, as
Per|&s;ons of genteel Birth, and generous Educa|tion could never think of, and
even if they were informed of them, would chu&s;e to overlook.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> then told me, Lord <HI>D&mdash;le</HI> had
abu&s;ed me all Day, tho' for what Cau&s;e I know not; but, with blunt
<HI>Ben,</HI> in <HI>Love for Love,</HI> I merrily told my Sea Officer, that as
for my Lord's Love or Liking, I valued it not of a Rope's <PB N="273" REF="280"> End, and that, mayhap, I liked him as little as he did me.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t forced him to drink a Pint of Wine with me, and would
have al&s;o forced Half a Guinea on him, but his Spirit would not admit of
that.</P>
<P>I was &s;o highly provoked at Lord <HI>D&mdash;le</HI>'s
In&s;olence and Pride, &s;o lit|tle becoming the Character of a Nobleman, that
I could not forbear writing &s;ome Lines on &s;o proper a Subject for Satire,
which Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> had &s;natched from me, and directly carried to his
Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>I went next Morning to wait on Ad|miral <HI>An&s;on,</HI> with a
Petition from the Si&s;ter of his Valet de Chambre, who hap|pened to be the
fir&s;t Man &s;hot in his fir&s;t Sea Engagement, to whom, be&s;ide a Part of
the Prize then taken, there was &s;even Years Wages due. I was &s;hewn into the
Back Parlour of a &s;mall Hou&s;e in <HI>Hanover-Square.</HI> It was well
adorned with Books in Gla&s;s Ca&s;es, even from the Ceiling to the Floor; and
on this Occa&s;ion, as I had a thou&s;and Pounds worth of Jewels left with me
by Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> who&s;e Father kept a <PB N="274" REF="281"> Shop in
<HI>Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, Dublin,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e off for him, knowing how
much Dre&s;s com|mands Re&s;pect, I put a pair of Diamond Ear-rings into my
Ears, tied on a Diamond Solitaire, and as for Lace, and every other
Appurtenance to &s;uit tho&s;e Ornaments, I had them of my own.</P>
<P>My glittering Appearance, and being in a Chair, &s;oon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ought the Admiral down in a rich
Undre&s;s, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, by the Account delivered of me, I mu&s;t be a

he begged my Pardon for his <HI>Di&s;habille:</HI> I turned, and &s;aid, I was
glad for once to &s;ee Learning and Valour &s;o happily united.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner did he find that I had only a Petition to deliver,
but his Coun|tenance changed to the &s;evere, and he told me, he believed
People thought he had brought Home the Wealth of the <HI>Indies,</HI> whereas
he had not a &s;ingle Shilling to com|mand, no more than the meane&s;t Sailor
aboard, the Money being all, as he &s;aid, paid into the Trea&s;ury, from
whence no <PB N="275" REF="282"> Man, without the utmo&s;t Difficulty, could
extract one &s;ingle Farthing of it; and hav|ing the Word of &s;o great a Man,

Lives, when even their very Admirals are not rewarded!</P>
<P>However, as I told the Admiral the Woman was actually &s;tarving,
he gave me a Guinea for her.</P>
<P>When I returned Home, I found in my Shop Lord <HI>D&mdash;le,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Skeffington,</HI> &s;ince dead, and another Gentleman waiting for me;
Lord <HI>D&mdash;le</HI> a&s;ked what he had done, to provoke me to write with
&s;o much Bitterne&s;s again&s;t him? Nay, my Lord, what had I done to
di&s;oblige you, or occa&s;ion your be&s;towing on me &s;uch gro&s;s Abu&s;e,
as Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> a&s;&s;ured me you did? My Lord &s;aid, upon his
Honour it was fal&s;e, and taking me by the Hand, a&s;&s;ured me he would be a
Friend to me, provided I gave him no more of my Pen; but as from that Hour to
this, he never did me any kind of Service, I think the Obligation void on my
Side, and there|fore <PB N="276" REF="283"> pre&s;ent my Readers with the

<L>To &s;um up all the black Detail,</L>
<L>I'd name the Scoundrel <HI>D&mdash;le.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>And now, my L&mdash;d, as I believe I am the fir&s;t Poet who ever
celebrated the illu&s;trious Name of <HI>St. L&mdash;dg&mdash;r,</HI> which
Name, by your &s;uppo&s;ed noble, and right-well remembered Father's Account,
you are as much intitled to, as I am to that of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> I hope
you will, according to your true Nobility, give me a hand|&s;ome Reward for
this extraordinary Pane|gyric!</P>
<P>And here I cannot avoid relating, that I believe, the true Cau&s;e
of his L&mdash;d&mdash;p's Aver&s;ion to me, was this: A little Time after I
was &s;eparated from my Hu&s;|band, as it was quite the Mode to attack me, he
employed one of his infernal Agents to inform me, he &s;hould be glad to drink
a Di&s;h of Tea with me; I told the Wretch I did not know his
L&mdash;d&mdash;p, and there|fore hoped he would excu&s;e me.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="285">But the <HI>Harridan,</HI> being re&s;olved
not to lo&s;e her Reward, told my L&mdash;d I would meet him &s;omewhere,
indeed I do not know the Place, and introduced to him a great, lu&s;ty,
ma&s;culine Woman, dre&s;&s;ed in a Calimanco Cap and Cloak, or long
Riding-hood. I believe his L&mdash;d&mdash;p wondered that &s;uch a Creature
had made any Noi&s;e in the World; &s;o telling her, he was &s;orry he had
given her the Trouble of coming there, he gave her a Guinea, and ha&s;tly
departed.</P>
<P>A few Nights after this, <HI>W&mdash;r&s;d&mdash;le</HI> had
<HI>The Cure for a Scold,</HI> altered from <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Taming
of a Shrew,</HI> into a Ballad Opera, by Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> played for his
own Benefit; I wrote a flaming Pro|logue to it, in Honour of my fair
Coun|trywomen, and <HI>W&mdash;r&s;d&mdash;le</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on my going to
&s;ee it, a&s;&s;uring me, he would have a Lettice &s;ecured entirely for me,
or any Friends I &s;hould plea&s;e to bring, and would him&s;elf take care of
placing me, and al&s;o guarding me &s;afe out, for really I was very much
afraid of receiving &s;ome In&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286">On the&s;e Promi&s;es I ventured to go; when
behold! the Lettice was full; but that was no Matter, the Ladies, though my
in|timate Friends, quickly decamped, and Mrs. <HI>Dub&mdash;g,</HI> the
Fidler's Wife, de|clared &s;he had like to faint at the Sight of the <HI>odious
Creature!</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gr&mdash;n</HI> al&s;o took to his Heels, &s;o
I had indeed the whole Lettice for me and my Company, which were two young
Mi&s;&s;es, Daughters to my Landlady.</P>
<P>My <HI>Gorgon</HI> Face, in&s;tead of turning my Enemies into
Stone, clapped Wings to their Feet, and made them fly down Stairs, like &s;o
many feathered <HI>Mercuries,</HI> Par&s;on and all, tho' he was bulky, and
tip&s;y, and dull, and &s;o forth; tho' indeed, tho&s;e Qualities might make
him de&s;cend with the greater Velocity, and give him a natural Alacrity in
&s;inking.</P>
<P>However, by their precipitant Flight, I got the front Row.</P>
<P>When the Play began, I forgot to keep up my Fan, and two Gentlemen
of Di&s;|tinction in the Pit bowed to me; pre|&s;ently after the Orange Girl
came up, and <PB N="280" REF="287"> &s;aid a Gentleman de&s;ired I would accept
of half a Dozen Oranges; I a&s;ked who it was? and &s;he &s;hewed me a Per&s;on
dre&s;&s;ed in Scarlet, trimmed with Black; as I did not know him, I told her
it was a Mi&s;take, and a young Girl, who followed her in, &s;aid, that was
L&mdash;d <HI>D&mdash;le,</HI> and that the Compliment was intended for her;
but the Orange Girl, calling her very fami|liarly by her Name, which was
<HI>Nancy Raymond,</HI> &s;wore to the contrary; for, &s;aid &s;he, you know
how you u&s;ed my L&mdash;d. They talked to one another in the vulgar Tongue,
being exceedingly well known to each other, having both followed the &s;ame
Occupation of Orange and Oy&s;ter Selling, and both came up Stairs into the
World.</P>
<P>To compo&s;e the Animo&s;ity, I bought &s;ome Fruit, and though I
really paid for it, I doubt not but his L&mdash;d&mdash;p did al&s;o.</P>
<P>When the Play was over, to which I mo&s;t heartily repented that I
went, <HI>W&mdash;r&s;|d&mdash;le</HI> came to put me into a Chair, &s;aid he
would &s;up with me, and kept his Word.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="288">I related to him the Play-Hou&s;e
Adven|ture, and asked him what kind of a Man L&mdash;d <HI>D&mdash;le</HI> was?
He told me, he was both a very loo&s;e, and a very unge|nerous Man, Qualities
which no way re|commended him to me; &s;o being honoured with a &s;econd
Me&s;&s;age from him, I, with an ab&s;olute, <HI>Sir, not I,</HI>
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me back the cloudy Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>But to return:</P>
<P>The next Day a mo&s;t ugly, &s;quinting, mean looking Fellow,
who&s;e good Clothes made his Awkwardne&s;s but the more con|&s;picuous, came
in to buy &s;ome Prints; his Mind was portrayed in his Countenance, where
Impudence and Ignorance &s;eemed to vie for Pre-eminence; however, he &s;poke
to me with great Civility, and perceiving, by his Accent, that he was an
<HI>Hibernian,</HI> I a&s;ked him, how long he had been in <HI>London?</HI>
Curio&s;ity lead me into a great deal of Chat with him, and as he knew every
great Family in <HI>Ireland,</HI> their Ser|vants at lea&s;t, he was able to
give me a good deal of Intelligence: I then enquired, whether Bu&s;ine&s;s or
Plea&s;ure had brought <PB N="282" REF="289"> him to <HI>London?</HI> He
&s;aid, both; and pull|ing out his Pocket-Book, told me, he would &s;urprize
me; I cannot &s;ay indeed but he did; for he &s;hewed me Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s
Head, engraven in Vellum, not in &s;ize much larger than a &s;mall Locket,
&s;uch as they wear in Rings, yet &s;o extremely like the Original, that there
was no Occa&s;ion to write the Name under it: Several more Pieces of the &s;ame
curious Work he &s;hewed to me, and &s;aid, he hoped to make his Fortune by
them in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I was afraid he would be di&s;appointed, as Painting
and Statuary were the Ta&s;te of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility; be&s;ide,
this is Work more &s;uited to a Wo|man than a Man; if I could do it, it might
turn to Account to me. Upon which, of his own Accord, he begged I would pa&s;s
his Works for mine, and that he would give me a third part of the Profit
ari&s;ing from the Sale of them: he gave me to un|der&s;tand he very well knew
who I was, and that our united Intere&s;t might be &s;er|viceable to each
other, an Offer I did not reject.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290">As he had many fine Mantlings cut, he could
very quickly in&s;ert the Arms, &s;o I de&s;ired he would fini&s;h one for
General <HI>Ch&mdash;h&mdash;l</HI>; he obeyed me, and I wait|ed on the old
Gentleman with it, and a few complimentary Lines, which I have now forgot. I
&s;ent in my Pre&s;ents, and the General de&s;ired I might be &s;hewn in: He
was in a very magnificent Drawing|room, adorned with Stucco Work, the
op|po&s;ite Door opened into a Garden, full blown;&mdash;the General was
&s;eated on a rich Sopha, at a Table adorned with Dre&s;|&s;ing-plate. He
de&s;ired I might &s;it down on a Sopha, oppo&s;ite to him, and ordered his
Servant to remove the Table; there were &s;everal Va&s;es filled with Flowers,
&s;weetly &s;melling round the Chamber; and, for my part, I rather imagined I
was in &s;ome <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Palace, than a Hou&s;e in
<HI>Gro&s;|venor-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>He thanked me for my Pre&s;ent, 
<Q REND="inline">"But, Madam, &s;aid he, it is to me quite
u&s;e|le&s;s, as all my Hou&s;e is Stucco Work; however, if you'll be &s;o kind
as to come up &s;tairs with me, we may perhaps find <PB N="284" REF="291">
&s;ome Place, where a Nail may be driven without Injury."</Q></P>
<P>As the old Gentleman doubted I might po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;take his
Meaning, he was go|ing to explain him&s;elf; upon which I took up the Picture,
and in very great Confu&s;ion made the be&s;t Speed out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not walked above twenty Yards, when one of the General's
Footmen over|took me, who told me, his Ma&s;ter was afraid I might fall in a
Fever, if I walked in the Heat of &s;o warm a Day, and there|fore de&s;ired I
would accept of a Guinea to pay my Chair; I took it, and returned my
Compliments.</P>
<P>As there was &s;omething humorous in the General's Behaviour, I
addre&s;&s;ed him the next Day in the following Lines:

<P>I never received any An&s;wer to the&s;e Lines, but in a very

<P>I gave the young Man both his Coat of Arms and the Guinea; &s;o we

<P>A very fine young Gentleman undertook to deliver my Pre&s;ent to
the Earl, and a Servant &s;hewed me into a Parlour. In a few Minutes the
Gentleman returned, and &s;aid my Lord de&s;ired to &s;ee me; &s;o he handed me
up into a full Levee of Stars, and different coloured Ribbons. As I had never
before been in &s;o augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly, I was ready to die with Shame,
e&s;pecially as there was not one of my own Sex to keep me in Countenance. My
Lord in a mo&s;t polite manner thanked me for the Honour, as he termed it, I
had done him; and the Noblemen, after his Example, &s;eemed to contend who
&s;hould prai&s;e me mo&s;t; to which I could make no other Re|turn than
Courte&s;ies and Blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>At length, the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> &s;aid there was a Defect in
the placing the Swords, which go through the Veldt Mar&s;hal's Arms, 
<PB N="289" REF="296"> which he would willingly have altered; and brought me
out a Print of the Noblemen's Arms, who held the &s;ame Dignity in
<HI>France,</HI> as a Pattern; I told his Lord&s;hip I could ea&s;ily alter it:

<Q REND="inline">"Pray then do, Madam, returned he, for I admire
your Work &s;o much, that I would willingly have it quite compleat."</Q>
Accordingly, it was fini&s;hed, and the next Morning I waited on his Excellency
with it, when, to my great Surprize, I had no Admi&s;&s;ion to him, but a
Footman brought down five Guineas to me.</P>
<P>I was not a little &s;urprized at this &s;udden Alteration in his
Lord&s;hip's Mind. But what had the Fool, who did the Work, done? truly told
Major <HI>Elliot&s;on,</HI> that I made a Hand of his Performances; he told my
Lord,&mdash;who vexed at being im|po&s;ed upon, &s;ent me the Trifle
above|mentioned, which was not, by any means, a Payment for the Labour and
Curio&s;ity of the Work, and what, from a Per&s;on of his Station, I &s;hould
not have thought an extraordinary Reward even for the Lines.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="297">So, finding the Folly of the Man, I would
not undertake to di&s;po&s;e of any more cut Vellum, but left him to make his
mo&s;t of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould never have thought this Fellow worth &s;peaking of,
only that my Hu&s;band has &s;aid he was my G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">llant, not that I owe any Reverence or Honour to him, or re|gard
what he can &s;ay, any more than the idle Wind, but that I would not have
&s;uch an Imputation laid on my Under&s;tanding, to &s;ay I made Choice of a
low-born, ugly, illiterate Scoundrel. No, no; Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> may re&s;t
a&s;&s;ured, that if I would have done him the Honour to exalt his Horn like
that of an Unicorn, it &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have been to me a
<HI>Cornu-Copia.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! poor I, have been for many Years a <HI>Noun
Sub&s;tantive,</HI> obliged to &s;tand alone, which, prai&s;e to the eternal
Goodne&s;s! I have done, notwith&s;tanding the various Efforts of my Enemies to
de&s;troy me, many of whom I have lived to triumph over, though they
encompa&s;&s;ed me on every Side, like &s;o many Bulls of <HI>Ba&s;an:</HI> and
though they &s;hould now kick up their <PB N="291" REF="298"> Heels, like &s;o
many wild A&s;&s;es in the Valley of <HI>Geohron</HI>; though the Dunces
&s;hould make Songs of me, and though 
<Q> 
<L>Envy &s;hou'd my faire&s;t Deeds belie,</L></Q> I think it
would not afflict me, but that I &s;hould be able to convince them I had, at
lea&s;t, Patience, Hope, and Charity, &s;uffi|cient to make them a&s;hamed of
the Injuries they have been weak and wicked enough to offer.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e I would now fairly challenge my mo&s;t malicious Foes to
an&s;wer from the Tribunal of their own Con&s;cience, what Provocation I ever
gave them to u&s;e me ill?</P>
<P>Whom have I defrauded or belyed? Nay, indeed, of whom have I
&s;poke half the Evil which it was in my Power to do? There are few Characters
immaculate, and had I an Inclination to retaliate Injuries, I am, I believe,
able enough to do it.</P>
<P>And &s;ometimes one has &s;o &s;trong an In|clination to it, that
it is hard to re&s;i&s;t, e&s;|pecially when a Lady of Quality, (that is

pre&s;umed to beg &s;he would do me the Honour of being a Sub|&s;criber to me,
a Privilege I thought a long Acquaintance might have entitled me to take, order
my Maid to be kicked; and as I am really a&s;hamed to u&s;e her Lady|&s;hip's
Words on the Occa&s;ion, being much too indecent for a Repetition, methinks
&s;he might have &s;pared them, e&s;pecially to one who knew her too!

<L>When &s;he was a Maid, if &s;he e'er was a Maid;</L> 
<L>When afraid of a Man, if &s;he e'er was afraid.</L></Q></P>

&s;omewhat har&s;h and uncouth in them, while her Sentiments are great and
virtuous; her Diction natural, ea&s;y, flow|ing, and harmonious.</P>
<P>Love &s;he wrote upon with Warmth, but then it was &s;uch as
Angels might &s;hare in without injuring their original Purity. Her Elegy on
her Hu&s;band's Daughter, is a Proof of the Excellency and Tenderne&s;s of her
own Heart, rarely met with in a Step-mother; nor could I ever read it without
Tears, a Proof it was wrote from her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="302">And dear <HI>Orinda!</HI> gentle Shade!
&s;weet Poet! Honour of thy Sex! Oh, if thou ha&s;t Power to do it, in&s;pire

<P>I cannot, except my own Country-woman, Mrs. <HI>Grier&s;on,</HI>
find out another female Writer, who&s;e Works are worth reading; &s;he indeed
had a happy and well-improved Genius. I remember &s;he wrote a very fine Poem
on Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkley's Ber|mudian</HI> Scheme; the Plan of it was this: She
&s;uppo&s;es that the Night before St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uffered, an Angel
appeared to comfort him with the future Pro&s;pect of the Church, 
<PB N="296" REF="303"> and the Growth of Chri&s;tianity; the Angel informs him
that in &s;uch a Year there &s;hall be born in the We&s;tern I&s;land a great
Apo&s;tle, who &s;hall be known by this Token: 
<Q> 
<L>'Tis he from Words fir&s;t rids Philo&s;ophy,</L> 
<L>And lays the dull material Sy&s;tem by,</L> 
<L>Affrights the daring Libertine to find</L> 
<L>Naught round him, but the pure, all-holy Mind;</L> 
<L>The blu&s;hing Sinner from his Covert draws</L> 
<L>Of Matters various Forms, and Motions Laws,</L> 
<L>His only Fortre&s;s from the Athei&s;t takes,</L> 
<L>And his atomic World at once unmakes.</L></Q> I am &s;orry
that I cannot recollect any more of this Poem, or that the Prophecy con|tained
in it of the Bi&s;hop's converting the <HI>Indians</HI> was, by the Avarice of
&s;ome in Power, fru&s;trated; for &s;urely he was well fitted for that holy
Mi&s;&s;ion, having Learn|ing and Innocence in Perfection. Nor do I at all
doubt that had this true Emba&s;&s;ador <PB N="297" REF="304"> of
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> been enabled to pur&s;ue the &s;acred Purpo&s;e of his Soul,
but the Power of working Miracles would have been added to his other heavenly
Gifts.</P>
<P>I have been accu&s;ed of writing bitterly again&s;t the Clergy; I
never did, but when they forgot their own High Calling; one B&mdash; in
particular, &s;ays,

<P>Lord, 'tis a &s;trange Thing that all B&mdash; will needs be
Authors! now would they avoid manife&s;ting their Dulne&s;s, we the illiterate
might conclude they were Men of profound Erudition, and that on that Account,
they were advanced to their high Stations: but the Devil owes &s;ome of them a
Shame, and is, when they do his Work, an excellent Payma&s;ter; yet it is
&s;trange, this &s;ame Dulne&s;s is not confined to them, it de&s;cends to
their Sons, witne&s;s our celebrated Comedy, <HI>The Su&s;picious Husband,</HI>
which, but for it's neither hav|ing one Character well drawn, any Plot, any
thing like a Sentiment, and wrote too in a gallimawfry Stile, might be a good
Performance; but as long as it is &s;tamped with a Name, it pa&s;&s;es current,
tho' Ster|ling No-Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>But, my L&mdash;d B&mdash;, tho' I have di|gre&s;&s;ed from you,
yet &s;ee my Love! I re|turn again: Ah, it was well I did not, even from
Scripture, pick up an un&s;avory Si|mile; I am much offended that you &s;hould 
<PB N="303" REF="310"> &s;ay, when I was la&s;t at Shrift with your Holine&s;s,
that we had no better Accom|modation for our Fea&s;t of Love, but a Carpet,
whereas I in&s;i&s;t on it, that the Pe|nance you enjoyned me, was as ea&s;y as
a Down-bed could make it; &s;o here I inva|lidate your Evidence in one Point,
and the re&s;t of your Accu&s;ation naturally falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>But being now tired at laughing at you, I'll tell you an
<HI>Arabian</HI> Tale. There was a really generous Man, who built a fine
Pa|vilion, to which were an Hundred Open|ings; as the Poor had free acce&s;s to
it, they were relieved by him at every Opening and Avenue; they ble&s;&s;ed his
Goodne&s;s, and his Fame flew far.</P>
<P>There was in his Neighbourhood the Son of an old Mi&s;er, who was
left im|men&s;ely rich; he was of a &s;ordid Temper, yet emulous of Prai&s;e,
&s;o he built &s;uch an|other Pavilion, and in like Manner di&s;|tributed Alms;
it &s;o fortuned, that one old Man attacked him &s;even times in the &s;ame
Morning at &s;even of the Entrances, he met him again at the eighth, and
a&s;ked <PB N="304" REF="311"> for an Alms, at this he lo&s;t all Patience, and
cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Did not I &s;even times re|lieve you?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ah, quoth the poor Man, Lord ble&s;s my Lord
<HI>Aboulca&s;em,</HI> I have walked three hundred times round his Pavilion,
been three hundred times relieved, and yet I am certain he does not know my
Face.</Q></P>
<P>So, to apply the Story, God ble&s;s my dear loved Lord
<HI>Kingsborough,</HI> who gives Hundreds without blowing a Trumpet be|fore his
good Deeds, or defaming the Cha|racters of tho&s;e whom his Bounty
ble&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I have often been &s;urprized at one of our C&mdash;s, which, to
&s;hew my Charity, I will in&s;ert. 
<Q>O Lord, who alone worke&s;t great Mar|vels! &s;end down upon our
B&mdash; and C&mdash; the healthful Spirit of thy Grace.</Q>
<HI>Marvellous</HI> would it be indeed, if they had either <HI>Health,
Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Grace</HI>; no Doubt but the learned Compilers of the
Liturgy had their own Rea&s;ons for this &s;upernatural Invocation; but why
nothing le&s;s than a <PB N="305" REF="312"> Miracle &s;hould ble&s;s the&s;e,
any more than any other Order of Men, I leave to &s;ome future Commentators,
and hope they will oblige us with Annotations on this extra|ordinary
Ejaculation.</P>
<P>I would not incur the Cen&s;ure of the Cl&mdash; &s;o far as to
give a Hint that they are not <HI>&s;ound:</HI> No, no, many of them are; but
then it is &s;o &s;ound as things that are hollow, Impiety hath made a Fea&s;t
of them, and now that their Bones are mar|rowle&s;s, their Blood is cold, and
Specula|tion dwells not in their Eyes; they hate us Youth. Gorbellied K&mdash;,
Bacon fed! ah, would we had the &s;haking of their Bags! I knew one of them,
who, without the lea&s;t Study, wrote the following two elegant and learned
Lines: 
<Q> 
<L>Yon &s;lanting Mountains glow with blue Marine,</L> 
<L>And yon cornuted Moons two Horns give &s;hine.</L></Q> I know
the Gentlemen had too much Mo|de&s;ty and Diffidence of their own &s;uperior 
<PB N="306" REF="313"> Talents to give their Works to the Pre&s;s; but I hope,
as they are charitable, they won't be di&s;plea&s;ed, as they are above mak|ing
Money of their Performances, that I &s;hould, &s;ince they, though but little,
&s;erve to &s;well my Volume, and, no doubt, will edify my Readers. I think I
have nothing to boa&s;t of as a Writer, but a great Memory, for if I could not
have retained <HI>Shake&s;pear, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. and the great Authors I
have la&s;t mentioned, to give a Ta&s;te of their Wit, when I was my&s;elf at a
Lo&s;s, I do not know how I could ever have com|pa&s;&s;ed three Volumes of
Memoirs.</P>
<P>Indeed if I had printed all the Poetry that has been &s;ent me for
that purpo&s;e, &s;ince I came to this Kingdom, it would have proved as odd a
Medley, as any thing ever yet exhibited to publick View. I &s;uppo&s;e every
one who fancied they had Wit, had a mind to &s;ee how it would look in Print,
but I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed. Though the learned Mr. <HI>Timothy
Ticklepitcher</HI> pre&s;|&s;ed very hard for a Place, it would be a &s;trong
Proof of my Vanity, to in&s;ert his anti &s;ublime Compliments to me.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="314">Another poetical Gentleman wrote me a long
Letter in a Text Hand, which put me into a Palpitation of the Heart, as I was
about that time threatened, (for certain &s;can|dalous Truths I have been

<HI>John Fal&s;taff</HI> did Secu|rity: When I, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>

there is not an Halfpenny Paper can peep its Head out, but pre&s;ently my Name
mu&s;t be dragged in by Head and Shoulders to grace it. But to the Letter:
Having recovered my Spirits, I read it over; and found a great many
Compli|ments, with a Promi&s;e, that the profound Author would wait on me at
Four o'Clock. I never thought of it till the time appointed, when 
<Q>

always &s;u&s;pect Fal&s;hood to lurk un|der a full Peruke. He ju&s;t came in
with a huge fat Man, as fat as Butter, with him, but would not &s;tay, for
which Rea&s;on I will not print his fond Letter, &s;o I think I am even with
him. If I were any way given to be proud, I think I have a great deal of

<P>I believe the&s;e Wretches would be very proud of being

Emperor <HI>Julian,</HI> vulgarly call|ed the <HI>Apo&s;tate,</HI> will neither

he did the <HI>Galileans,</HI> unle&s;s they preach Sedition, and then they
come under the Penalty of the Law.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Julian!</HI> the Chri&s;tians murdered him, for not
permitting them to murder each other. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Younger,
preaching old St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Funeral Ser|mon, forty Years after the
Death of <HI>Julian,</HI> when one would have thought Re&s;entment might be
al&s;o dead, (if he had any Cau&s;e for it) has the&s;e remarkable Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"And now, &s;ays he, here lies my Uncle dead, who
delivered you from the Per&s;ecution of that old Bull-burning Tyrant
<HI>Julian</HI>: Now, who had a greater Hand in his Death than my Uncle? For
once, when he and his Captain of the Archers came in to hear Ma&s;s, had he not
&s;uddenly gone away, my Uncle would have kicked him."</Q> The Tran&s;lator
&s;ays, he had more Difficulty with this Pa&s;&s;age than all the re&s;t of the
Work; for he would fain have had the Kicking intended for the Captain of the
Archers, not being able to conceive, that the Emperor of the World 
<PB N="314" REF="321"> &s;hould be afraid that an old Prie&s;t &s;hould kick
him.</P>
<P>But the old Prie&s;t prophe&s;ied that &s;uch a Day this
Apo&s;tate &s;hould die, and truly he took e&s;pecial Care that his Prophecy
&s;hould be fulfilled, by hiring one of the Emperor's own Soldiers to put him
to Death.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay &s;omething more; why &s;hould I not; nay, out it
mu&s;t: I believe, if my favourite Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> had not behaved
him&s;elf with more good Manners than our modern <HI>New Lighters,</HI> he
would not have <HI>almo&s;t</HI> per&s;uaded his Auditors to be Chri|&s;tians;
how noble is his An&s;wer on the Oc|ca&s;ion?</P>
<P>But he was as remarkably a fine Gentle|man, as he was a Saint, a
Martyr, and a Chri&s;tian; like Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> who&s;e preaching goes
even to the dividing of the Blood and Spirit. And let me here, dear Sir, beg
you will fulfil a Promi&s;e you gave me many Years ago, that you would at|tend
my la&s;t Moments; if I &s;end to you, will you refu&s;e to chear a dying

univer&s;ally recei|ved, <PB N="315" REF="322"> that Half the World are ca&s;t
into De&s;|pair.</P>
<P>The&s;e poor Enthu&s;ia&s;ts u&s;ed, in <HI>London,</HI> to
&s;teal every thing they could lay their Hands on from me, in&s;omuch that at
la&s;t they &s;tole my one Pair of Shoes; and yet they brought Scripture
Authority for Theft, for they &s;aid the Children of <HI>I&s;rael borrowed
Jewels of Gold and Silver</HI> of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> which they ran away
with, <HI>and they &s;poiled the</HI> Egyptians. I remember I once menti|oned
this Pa&s;&s;age to Dr. <HI>Delany,</HI> who under&s;tanding <HI>Hebrew</HI>
perfectly, turned over to it to there, where it is very differ|rently related:
For the <HI>Egyptians</HI> finding &s;o many Plagues brought on them, and
particularly the Lepro&s;y, with which the&s;e People were all infected,
ordered them to depart, but they declared they would not go, unle&s;s their
Hire was paid to them, and al&s;o &s;o many Changes of Apparel, and Jewels of
Gold, given to &s;upport them in their Pilgrimage; how they behaved
them|&s;elves in the Wilderne&s;s, is &s;o well &s;et forth in the <HI>Old
Te&s;tament,</HI> that it would puzzle a wi&s;er Head than mine to know how
they <PB N="316" REF="323"> became the peculiar Favourites of an im|partial and
unprejudiced Deity.</P>
<P>Indeed it were to be wi&s;hed, that ei|ther this learned and
excellent Divine, or &s;ome other of equal Abilities, if &s;uch may be found,
would oblige the World with a new Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Old
Te&s;tament,</HI> &s;ince, as we now have it, it &s;eems filled with
Incon|gruities, Indecencies, and &s;hocking Ab&s;ur|dities, &s;uch as the Holy
Spirit could never have dictated, <HI>who&s;e Body is Light, and who&s;e Shadow
Truth.</HI></P>
<P>I beg pardon for this rambling Digre&s;|&s;ion, and hope the
Divines will not cen&s;ure me for it, as I only pre&s;ume to give them Hints,
which their &s;uperior Knowledge may improve upon, 
<Q> 
<L>And ju&s;tify the Ways of God to Man.</L></Q></P>
<P>For I intend not this Addre&s;s to the ig|norant Part of the
Clergy, who would many of them be more fit to till the Earth, than plant or
water the Go&s;pel, but to the learn|ed, ju&s;t, and pious, that they may
remove Scruples from weak Minds, <HI>rai&s;e up tho&s;e</HI> 
<PB N="317" REF="324"> <HI>that are fallen, and finally, beat down Satan under
our Feet,</HI> which God of his infinite Mercy enable them to do, through the
Me|rits and Mediation of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But once more to return to my Shop. One Afternoon two young
Gentlemen came into it, one of whom a&s;ked me for &s;ome Tea; I told him, I
did not &s;ell any, but that there was a Coffee-Hou&s;e next Door, where he
might be &s;upplied: He a&s;ked me, would not I give a Di&s;h of Tea to a
Friend, and Relation? I &s;aid, yes, with Plea&s;ure: Why then, &s;aid he, this
Gentleman is Dean <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ade</HI>'s
Son, of <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> and my Name
is <HI>Bl&mdash;nd&mdash;n</HI>; as his Father was married to Brigadier
<HI>Meade's</HI> Widow, I gave them an Invitation into the Parlour, and ordered
&s;ome Tea to be got ready. I was really very glad to &s;ee any Per&s;on from
<HI>Ireland,</HI> particularly tho&s;e I was allied to, nor could I conceive
that they came in that manner only to in&s;ult a Woman, who never of|fended
either of them; indeed, as for the Dean's Son, I mu&s;t acquit him, for he did
not affront me, but I took it ill he &s;hould bring with him a Fellow he knew
de&s;igned it.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="325">There was nothing gro&s;s, indecent,
abu|&s;ive, or unmannerly, which this Wretch did not, without the lea&s;t
Provocation, &s;ay to me, till, at length, though I am not really of a
pa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;po&s;ition, I lo&s;t all Pa|tience, and thinking my&s;elf
very much his Betters, I a&s;ked him, whether his Father continued to &s;ell
Butter-milk to the Poor at a Penny a Quart, with his own Hand, in a hard
Sea&s;on, when every other Per&s;on gave their's away.</P>
<P>Upon this he very politely threatened to kick me, but as he was
then at a great Di|&s;tance from his own Dunghill, and I am &s;ure I give
<HI>Ca&s;tle-Bl&mdash;nd&mdash;n</HI> its proper Title when I &s;tile it one, I
was not in the lea&s;t intimidated, and only bade him go &s;hew his Slaves how
choleric he was, and

<P>And here excu&s;e me, Sir, if I give your Picture to the World.
When you make Love, if any but the leaden-darted <HI>Cupid</HI> ever touched
your unworthy, groveling, ba&s;e Heart, your Argument is that of a

<P>Could not you have taken your ancient Father, the old Stick
picker's Advice, and have coaxed the Girl, and have given her a Cherry-coloured
Top-knot? but you 
<Q> 
<L>Were like the haughty, hot-brain'd <HI>Spa|niard,</HI></L> 
<L>In&s;tead of Love, you brought a Poignard.</L></Q></P>
<P>And filthy as your rotten Leg, and more corrupted Soul, mu&s;t
have been every thing you could produce; for thou art the Quinte&s;&s;ence of
Filth, and I am weary of writing, when every thing ba&s;e, every thing low,
every thing in&s;olent is the Theme, and all compri&s;ed in pretty Ma&s;ter
<HI>Jacky Bl&mdash;nd&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>As I have mentioned an Attempt to write a Play, which 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Is a bold Pretence</L> 
<L>To Learning, Genius, Wit, and Eloquence.</L></Q> 
<PB N="320" REF="327"> I pre&s;ent my Readers with an Act of it, and would,
with great Plea&s;ure, fini&s;h it, but that I am certain our pre&s;ent Manager
would never permit it to be played, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ly becau&s;e it was mine; for &s;ince his Prejudice again&s;t me,

</TEXT></Q>
<P>One Day, as I was in my Shop, a Gen|tleman, very richly
dre&s;&s;ed, told me, he had a Letter for me; I received it very
re&s;pectfully, but could not help &s;miling, when I found it was the Letter I
wrote for <HI>Tom Bru&s;h,</HI> neatly copied and directed to me, and that,
le&s;t it &s;hould mi&s;carry, he had brought it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;aid it was a very genteel Piece of Gal|lantry, and quite now.
He told me he <PB N="241" REF="348"> was going to his Seat in the County of
<HI>Sur|rey</HI> the next Day, and gave me a very kind Invitation to pa&s;s the
Remainder of the Summer there, but as he was a young, gay, &s;ingle Gentleman,
I did not hold it convenient.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, &s;aid he, do you never go to the Opera? No, really,
Sir; not but that I love Mu&s;ic, but it happens to be too expen&s;ive an
Entertainment for me: Well then, Madam, returned he, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on
having the Honour of treating you to it; on which, he downright forced a
Cou|ple of Guineas on me, and making me promi&s;e to corre&s;pond with him till
his Re|turn to <HI>London,</HI> we parted.</P>
<P>Unfortunately I lo&s;t his Direction, and &s;o had it not in my
Power to keep my Word.</P>
<P>And I do a&s;&s;ure my Readers, I did not go to the Opera,
wi&s;ely con&s;idering that two Pound two, would be of infinitely more Service
to me, than it could po&s;&s;ibly be to Mr. <HI>Heydeigger.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! before the Return of Winter, I had neither Shop, nor
almo&s;t an Habi|tation. <PB N="342" REF="349"> By what &s;trange Rever&s;e of
For|tune I was again reduced to the utmo&s;t Calamity, and by what unexpected

to get it into the Com|pa&s;s of this Volume, be the Subject of a Third.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be highly ungrateful not to ac|knowledge the Favour and
Bounty of the whole Body of the Nobility, Clergy, and Gentry of this Kingdom,
who&s;e Goodne&s;s, as it is my highe&s;t Pride to own, &s;o it &s;hall ever be

<P>I ought to have premi&s;ed, that ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed this

<P><HI>W&mdash;&s;d&mdash;le</HI> came in the Evening, told me that

<P><PB N="348" REF="355">By this I found Mr.

&s;mall Re|ward that had received the Poem before from another Hand, would they
not have laughed at me!</P>
<P>I waited on Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> who told me he had given my Poem
to his Excellency with the&s;e Words: 
<Q REND="inline">"That if he had not thought it beautiful, he would
not have ta|ken the Liberty of pre&s;enting it to him."</Q></P>

be&s;t rewarded."</Q></P>
<P>The next Day Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> attacked his Excellency again,
and a&s;ked him how he liked the Lines? Upon which he &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh I had forgot, there's two Guineas for her, but
don't put them into your Sil|ver Pocket, le&s;t you &s;hould make a Mi&s;take

this Bounty, I return my Acknowledgements to Him.</P>
<P>My dear Lord <HI>King&s;borough,</HI> I never &s;hould have

<P>Ju&s;t as I was writing about <HI>W&mdash;r&s;d&mdash;le,</HI> a

<HI>Scholar,</HI> as he tells us, him&s;elf, &s;tar|ving in a Garret; Pray, Mr.

you mean; if he can write &s;o much better than I, let him give the World a
Proof of his Abilities; but it &s;eems, he is di&s;contented that I have not
&s;ufficiently ex|po&s;ed him: Why, let him have but a little Patience, and my
Life on't he &s;hall have no Cau&s;e of Complaint on that Head, but I cannot
break in on the Order of Time &s;o far as to give the World a &s;econd Act of
him, yet</P>
<P>Unity of Time and Place, you know, Mr. Critick, mu&s;t be
ob&s;erved, otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t renounce the Stagyrite.</P>
<P>If you intend your Performance for a Satire on me, truly your
Words are &s;o clerkly couched, that I cannot find any Sting in them.&mdash;You
&s;ay I admired the Dean for being a Brute.&mdash;<HI>N. B.</HI> You lye; and
none but a Villain would call him one. I admired his Charity, Wit, Sen&s;e,
Ta&s;te, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to &s;ay he had Pa&s;&s;ions, which ob|&s;cured
for a while his &s;hining and uncom|mon Excellencies, is no more than &s;aying
he was human, and con&s;equently liable to Error.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="358">Then you a&s;k me, how I dare mention Mr.
<HI>Pope?</HI> Why truly, like <HI>Drawcan&s;ir,</HI> all this I can do,
becau&s;e I dare.&mdash;I never refu&s;ed doing Ju&s;tice to his poetical
Merits; but all your Art can never per|&s;uade the World, that he was not an
en|vious Defamer of other Men's good Parts, and intolerably vain of his own.
How does he boa&s;t of his Acquaintance with the Great, even to childi&s;h
Folly? The late Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> could not divert him|&s;elf with
pruning a Tree in his Garden, but pre&s;ently we are told of it in the&s;e
high|&s;ounding unharmonious Words: 
<Q> 
<L>And he, who&s;e Thunder &s;torm'd th'<HI>Iberian</HI>
Lines,</L> 
<L>Now forms my Quincunx, and now prues my Vines.</L></Q> Why,
one would have thought he had hired the Earl for a Gardener.</P>
<P>And as for his Gratitude, let that appear by his Poem, called
<HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> wherein he abu&s;es the late Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI> for his
Munificence to Writers, whereof take the following Sample: 
<Q><PB N="352" REF="359"> 
<L>His Wealth Lord <HI>Timon</HI> gloriou&s;ly con|founds,</L> 
<L>Ask'd for a Groat, he gives an hundred Pounds;</L> 
<L>Or, if three Ladies like a luckle&s;s Play,</L> 
<L>Takes the whole Hou&s;e upon the Author's Day.</L></Q> Was
this any Defect in his Grace's Charac|ter, e&s;pecialy in a poetical Eye? No,
&s;urely: but I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was angry, as he was not a
Dramatick Writer, that his Grace &s;hould be&s;tow any Favour on them.</P>
<P>He then proceeds to ridicule his Grace's Library, and the Grandeur
and Magnifi|cence of his Improvements.

<P>Now to criticize on your wonderful Work: In the fir&s;t Place, you
&s;ay all my Characters are well drawn, ea&s;y, natural and picture&s;que; and
yet after this high Compliment, that I even made a dull Story entertaining by
the Force of a &s;park|ling Wit, and retentive Memory; why, pre&s;ently after I
dwindle, by the Force of your Pen, into a mere Dunce: And &s;o though you
promi&s;ed us a Parallel, you give us a Contra&s;t; you are a very witty
Fellow, I a&s;&s;ure you, and deal much in <PB N="356" REF="363"> the
Surprizing. And &s;o you do not like my Poetry, there was no Thought of
plea&s;ing you when it was writ; but go to my Trea&s;urer, tell him I order him

<P>Hey-day, the Devil rides on a Fiddle|&s;tick! fre&s;h News
arrived! all my Letters to <HI>W&mdash;r&s;d&mdash;le</HI> to be publi&s;hed;
oh terrible! well; I hope he will publi&s;h every Poem that was inclo&s;ed in
them, that I may come by my own again? let him return to me three Operas,
twenty-five Odes, the Let|ters I wrote for him, the Poem which begins, 
<Q> 
<L>To di&s;tant Climes, while fond <HI>Cleora</HI> flies.</L></Q>
And then he has my full Leave to publi&s;h every Letter of mine that he thinks
will &s;erve his Purpo&s;e; but remember that if you and he &s;hould &s;it
down, and out of your own Loggerheads write Non&s;en&s;e, and offer it to the
World as mine, I enter my <HI>Caveat,</HI> and will not adopt the &s;purious
I&s;&s;ue. So here I quit ye, and upon mature <PB N="357" REF="364">
Deliberation, am &s;orry I wa&s;ted &s;o much Time, Paper, and Ink, on &s;o
contemptible a Subject as either of ye.</P>
<P>My Lord, I beg Pardon for &s;o long di|gre&s;&s;ing from my
darling Theme, but it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me not to <HI>be&s;tow
tho&s;e Libellers a La&s;h</HI>;

<P>And though it is not in reality worth while to pur&s;ue
Gra&s;hoppers, who die in a Sea&s;on, yet while their Noi&s;e offends me, I
cannot forbear it.</P>
<P>And, now my Lord, and oh! (&s;ince you permit me to call you by
that tender Name) my Friend, and let me add, my Guardian Angel; for &s;urely,
very excellent has thy Favour been to me, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of Kindred,
as you generou&s;ly bid me name my Wi&s;h to you, and obtain it; and as I,
broken with the Storms of Fortune, for I may truly &s;ay with Holy
<HI>David,</HI> to my Creator, 
<Q><PB N="358" REF="365">Even from my Youth up, thy Terrors have I
&s;uffered with a troubled Mind, and thou ha&s;t vexed me with all thy
Storms.</Q> Have little to hope for on this Side Di&s;&s;o|lution, and have no
other Concern about parting with a Life, which has been but a continual Scene
of Sorrow, except that of leaving my Son unprovided for: Let your Favour extend
to him, as your Station and Virtue mu&s;t ever give you a powerful In|tere&s;t;
u&s;e a Portion of it to get him &s;ome little Employment, or Place, which may
give him Bread, when I no more want it.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf he will not be entirely unworthy of your
Goodne&s;s, as he is of a generous, humane, and grateful Di&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg your Lord&s;hip's Pardon for prai&s;ing my Son, which
indeed, I &s;hould not do, but that both his Father and Mr. <HI>A&mdash;e,</HI>
endeavoured all in their Power to injure his Character; the latter of whom is
&s;ince convinced he wronged him.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="366">And here I mu&s;t apologize for &s;o long
deferring the Publication of this Second Volume; and as no Rea&s;on is &s;o
good as the true one, take it as follows:</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I took a Hou&s;e near
<HI>Bow-Bridge,</HI> as well for the Plea&s;ure of a fine Art, as to keep
retired from bu&s;y Tongues; but, finding it was highly inconvenient to be at
&s;uch a Di&s;tance from Printers, Stationers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I took a
Fir&s;t-Floor in <HI>Abbey-Street,</HI> and having my own Furniture, &s;ent it
there, with Orders to the Men to put up the Beds, which accordingly was done:
When I came in the Evening to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my new Habitation,
be|hold all my Furniture was torn down, and lying in Heaps in the Pa&s;&s;age;
when I demanded the Cau&s;e of this, I was told, the Reverend Dr. <HI>J&mdash;n
V&mdash;ey,</HI> who, it &s;eems, lodged in the Hou&s;e, had, by his own
&s;pecial Authority, commanded the Goods &s;hould be thrown into the Street,
but the Landlord knowing him&s;elf liable to be called to an Account for what
he had <PB N="360" REF="367"> received, did not chu&s;e to obey him in that
Article.</P>
<P>Well, as my Hou&s;e was empty, I knew not where I, or my Child
could &s;leep that Night, but, as I was not ill-beloved in the Neighbourhood I
left, I went back to it, where a good Woman gave me part of her Bed, and her
Hu&s;band, my Son, and two little Children of theirs, lay together.</P>
<P>Early next Morning, my Son took a Lodging for me in
<HI>Big-butter-lane</HI>; my Goods, damaged as they were, were carried there,
but, wot you well, the Par&s;on fol|lowed them! Dr. <HI>V&mdash;ey,</HI> I
mean, told the People I was a very bad Woman, and they were again left in the
Pa&s;&s;age; &s;o when I came, there was no Entrance for me, and I was obliged
to return to the Place from whence I came. <HI>Mem.</HI> I was forty Shillings
out of Pocket by this pious Divine, I wi&s;h he would pay me.</P>
<P>Next Day my Son took a Lodging for me in <HI>Gol en-lane,</HI>
where the Woman no &s;ooner under&s;tood I was Dr. <HI>Van Lewin</HI>'s
Daughter, who, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;aved her Life, but &s;he gladly accepted of
me for a Lodger; <PB N="361" REF="368"> but what with the Vexation of my Mind,
and the Cold I had got, I fell into a violent Fever, and was for many Weeks
confined to my Bed, till, by the Care and Skill of Dr. <HI>Ould,</HI> I was
once more enabled to pur|&s;ue my Work; and, as I am much indebted to his
Humanity, I take this Opportunity of acknowledging it.</P>
<P>And now do I expect an Army of Cri|tics to attack my poor Work,
and to &s;ave them the Trouble, I will even do it my|&s;elf, altho' I own the
Task to be a little un|grateful. But, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,</HI>
notwith|&s;tanding the Regard and Affection which I really have for you, I
mu&s;t tell you what the World &s;ays of you; but however, I will give you fair
Play, and allow you to make the be&s;t Defence you can for your|&s;elf:
Suppo&s;e you and I enter into a Dia|logue, I being the Accu&s;er, begin:
Ma|dam, your Story has nothing in it, either new or entertaining; the
Occurrences are common, trivial, and &s;uch as happen every Day; your Vanity is
intolerable, your Stile borrowed from <HI>Milton, Shake&s;pear</HI> 
<PB N="362" REF="369"> and <HI>Swift,</HI> whom you pretend to de&s;cribe,
though you never knew him; you tell us a Story of his Beef being
over-roa&s;ted, and another of a mangy Dog; fine Themes truly! for my Part, I
wonder you ever got a Shilling for your curious Performance; I am &s;ure it is
a Proof of the Stupidity of the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> who, tho' they have &s;till
done you the Honour to adverti&s;e in every Paper, that you were not a Dunce,
proved them&s;elves to be little better for taking &s;o much Notice of you.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> Hold, hold, you charge me &s;o fa&s;t you do
not give me Leave to reply; to your fir&s;t Article I plead guilty; my Story is
dull enough, it was therefore I &s;trove to embelli&s;h it with &s;uch poetical
Ornaments, as I could beg, borrow, or &s;teal: I have known a Gentleman write a
<HI>Latin</HI> Poem, and every Line of it was borrowed from the Cla&s;&s;icks,
yet this was e&s;teemed a Beauty in him; why then &s;hould it be deemed a Fault
in your humble Servant? Had I not an equal Right to make free with <HI>Milton,
Swift,</HI> and <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> as he had with <HI>Vir|gil</HI> and
<HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> O lud, lud! why the be&s;t Part of your fir&s;t
Volume, is that which you wrote from your&s;elf, without the&s;e
Auxiliaries.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> Oh, upon my Word you com|pliment now.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="370"><HI>I.</HI> Truly, I did not intend it, but
we would rather have &s;ome of your own Stuff.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> Why I mu&s;t bring you a Simile from what I do
not much deal in, that is, Needle-work; do not Ladies buy coar&s;e Canva&s;s,
and work thereon Fruits, Flowers, Trees, all Summer, and all Autumn's Pride?
and &s;hould we &s;ay the Canvas would have been better without the Arti&s;t's
curi|ous Embroidery; the &s;ame will hold in Painting.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> O come, do not think to put us off at this Rate, you
give us Quotation on Quotation; why, we know the Works of other Writers, and
expected &s;omething en|tirely new from your &s;uperior Pen.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> I am &s;orry it is not in my Power to oblige
you, but Kings and Prophets, who lived before me, have declared, there was
nothing new under the Sun.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> But you &s;hew no Reverence, either to Ermin, Crape or
Lawn.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> O I really do, when the Wearers de&s;erve them;
but I hope you would not have me pay Homage to the Things them|&s;elves? Why
then, I may go and kneel down to all the Goods in the Shops, becau&s;e as the
Author of <HI>The Tale of a Tub,</HI> &s;ays, in them we live, move, and have
our Be|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="371"><HI>I.</HI> But have you no farther Regard
to Station? Is your licentious Pen to la&s;h all Orders and Degrees of People?
are you to indulge your laughing, and la&s;hing Hu|mour, at every Bodies
Expence.</P>
<P><HI>My&s;elf.</HI> Why, &s;ure I have a Right to it; have they not
laughed and la&s;hed me round? This is but a Retaliation, they were the fir&s;t
Aggre&s;&s;ors; no Per&s;on who did not de&s;erve a Stripe, ever got one from
me: Is Station a Privilege for doing every Thing Evil with Impunity? If &s;o,
let <HI>Satan</HI> on his burning Throne be honoured!</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Well, upon my Word, Mrs. <HI>Pil|kington,</HI> I am
weary of your Arguments; you &s;eem re&s;olved to get the better of me, and
<HI>that</HI> my Readers may always be a&s;&s;ured I will do, when I am both
Plaintiff and Defendant.</P>
<P>And I a&s;&s;ure my Readers, that if my Third Volume is not filled
with more &s;ur|prizing Events, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">finitely more enter|taining than either of the foregoing, I will for
ever quit my Magic Art, and 
<Q> 
<L>Deeper than did ever Plummet &s;ound,</L> 
<L>I'll drown my Book.</L>
