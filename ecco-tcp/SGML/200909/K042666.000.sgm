<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Large and elegant bridge, forming a way over a broad and rapid river, is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the noble&s;t pieces of mechani&s;m that man is capable of performing. And the u&s;efulne&s;s of an art which, at the &s;ame time that it con|nects di&s;tant &s;hores by a way over the deep and rapid waters, al&s;o allows tho&s;e waters and their navigation to pa&s;s &s;mooth and uninterrupted, renders all probable attempts to advance the theory or practice of it, highly de&s;erving the encouragement of the public.</P>
<P>This little book is offered as an attempt towards the per|fection of the theory of this art, in which the properties, di|men&s;ions, proportions, and other relations of the various parts of a bridge, are &s;trictly demon&s;trated, and clearly illu&s;trated by various examples. It is divided into five &s;ections: the <HI>1&s;t</HI> treats on the projects of bridges, containing a regular detail of the various circum&s;tances and con&s;iderations that are cog|nizable in &s;uch projects: The <HI>2d</HI> treats on arches, demon|&s;trating their various properties, with the relations between their intrados and extrados, and clearly di&s;tingui&s;hes the mo&s;t preferable curves to be u&s;ed in a bridge; the fir&s;t two or three propo&s;itions being in&s;tituted after the manner of two or three done by Mr. Emer&s;on in his Fluxions and Mechanics: The <HI>3d</HI> &s;ection treats on the piers, demon&s;trating their thick|ne&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting any kind of an arch, &s;pringing at any height, and that both when part of the pier is &s;uppo&s;ed to be immer&s;ed in water, and when otherwi&s;e: The <HI>4th</HI> de|mon&s;trates the force of the water again&s;t the end or face of the pier, con&s;idered as of different forms; with the be&s;t form for dividing the &s;tream, &amp;c. and to it is added a table &s;hewing the &s;everal heights of the fall of the water under the arches, ari&s;ing from its velocity and the ob&s;truction of the piers; as it was compo&s;ed by Tho. Wright, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Auckland, in the county of Durham, who informs me it is part of a word on which he has &s;pent much time, and with which he intends to favour the public: And the <HI>5th</HI> and la&s;t &s;ection contains a dictionary of the mo&s;t material terms peculiar to the &s;ubject;
<PB N="iv" REF="3">in which many practical ob&s;ervations and directions are given, which could not be &s;o regularly nor properly introduced into the former &s;ections. The whole, it is pre&s;umed, containing full directions for con&s;tituting and adapting to one another, the &s;everal e&s;&s;ential parts of a bridge, &s;o as to make it the &s;tronge&s;t; and the mo&s;t convenient, both for the pa&s;&s;age over and under it, that the &s;ituation and other circum&s;tances will po&s;&s;ibly admit: not indeed for the actual methods of di&s;po&s;ing the &s;tones, making of mortar, or the external ornaments, &amp;c. tho&s;e things I do not de&s;cend to, but leave to the di&s;cretion of the practical architect, as being no part of the plan of my un|dertaking; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on al&s;o I have given no views of bridges, but only prints of &s;uch parts or figures as are ne|ce&s;&s;ary in explaining the elementary parts of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As my profe&s;&s;ion is not that of an architect, very probably I &s;hould never have turned my thoughts to this &s;ubject, &s;o as to addre&s;s the public upon it, had it not been from the occa&s;ion of an accident in that part of the country in which I re&s;ide, viz. the fall of Newca&s;tle and other bridges on the river Tyne on the <HI>17th</HI> of november <HI>1771,</HI> occa&s;ioned by a high flood which ro&s;e about <HI>9</HI> feet higher at Newca&s;tle than the u&s;ual &s;pring tides do.&mdash;And this occa&s;ion having furni&s;hed me with many opportunities of hearing and &s;eeing very ab&s;urd things advanced on the &s;ubject in general, I thought the demon&s;trations of the relations of the e&s;&s;ential parts of a bridge, would not be unac|ceptable to tho&s;e architects and others who may be capable of perceiving the force of them, and who&s;e ignorance may not have prejudiced them again&s;t things which they do not un|der&s;tand.</P>
<P>In the <HI>4th</HI> &s;ection there is one thing forgotten to be re|marked, viz. That in determining the be&s;t form of the end of the pier to be a right-lined triangle, the water was &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trike every part of it with the &s;ame velocity: had the vari|ably increa&s;ed velocity been u&s;ed, the form of the ends would come out a little curved; but as the increa&s;e of the velocity in the be&s;t bridges is very &s;mall, the difference in them is quite imperceptable.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRINCIPLES OF STONE BRIDGES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Projects of Bridges, with the De&s;ign; E&s;timate, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a bridge is deemed nece&s;&s;ary to be built over a river, the fir&s;t con&s;ideration is the place of it; or what particular &s;ituation will contain a maximum of the advantages over the di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>In agitating this mo&s;t important que&s;tion, e|very circum&s;tance, certain and probable, attend|ing or likely to attend the bridge, &s;hould be &s;eparately, minutely, and impartially &s;tated and examined; and the advantage or di&s;advantage of it rated at a value proportioned to it: then the difference between the whole advantages and
<PB N="2" REF="5">di&s;advantages, will be the neat value of that particular &s;ituation for which the calculation is made. And by doing the &s;ame for any other &s;ituations, all their neat values will be found, and of con&s;equence the mo&s;t preferable &s;ituation among them.&mdash;Or, in a competition between two place, if each one's advantage over the other be e&s;timated or valued in every circum|&s;tance attending them, the &s;ums of their advan|tages will &s;hew whether of them is the better. And the &s;ame being done for this and a third, and &s;o on, the be&s;t &s;ituation of all will be ob|tained.</P>
<P>In this e&s;timation, a great number of particu|lars mu&s;t be included; and nothing omitted that can be found to make a part of the con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, the &s;ituation of the town or place for the convenience of which the bridge is chiefly to be made, will naturally produce a particular of the fir&s;t con&s;equence; and a great many others ought to be &s;acrificed to it. If po&s;&s;ible, the bridge &s;hould be placed where there can conveniently be opened and made pa&s;&s;ages or &s;treets from the ends of it in every direction, and e&s;pecially one as nearly in the direction of the bridge it&s;elf as po&s;&s;ible, tending towards the body of the town, without narrows or crooked windings, and ea&s;ily communicating with the chief &s;treets, thoroughfares, &amp;c.&mdash;And here
<PB N="3" REF="6">every per&s;on, in judging of this, &s;hould dive&s;t him&s;elf of all partial regards or attachments what|ever; think and determine for the good of the whole only, and for po&s;terity as well as the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>The banks or declivities towards the river are al&s;o of particular concern, as they affect the conveniency of the pa&s;&s;age to and from the bridge, or determine the height of it, upon which in a great mea&s;ure depends the expence.</P>
<P>The breadth of the river, the navigation upon it, and the quantity of water to be pa&s;&s;ed, or the velocity and depth of the &s;tream, from al&s;o con&s;iderations of great moment; as they deter|mine the bridge to be higher or lower, longer or &s;horter. However, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, a wide part of the river ought rather to be cho&s;en than a narrow one, e&s;pecially if it is &s;ubject to great tides or floods; for, the increa&s;ed velocity of the &s;tream in the narrow part, being again aug|mented by the farther contraction of the breadth, by the piers of the bridge, will both incommode the navigation through the arches, and under|mine the piers and endanger the whole bridge.</P>
<P>The nature of the bed of the river is al&s;o of great concern, it having a great influence on the expence; as upon it, and the depth and velocity
<PB N="4" REF="7">of the &s;tream, depend the manner of laying the foundations, and building the piers.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief and capital articles of con|&s;ideration, and which will branch them&s;elves out into other dependent ones, and &s;o lead to the required e&s;timate of the whole.</P>
<P>HAVING re&s;olved on the place, the next con|&s;iderations are the form, the e&s;timate of the ex|pence, and the manner of execution.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the form; &s;trength, utility, and beauty ought to be regarded and united; the chief part of which lies in the arches. The form of the arches will depend on their height and &s;pan; and the height on that of the water, the navigation, and the adjacent banks. They ought to be made &s;o high, as that they may ea&s;ily tran&s;mit the water at its greate&s;t height either from tides or floods; and their height and figure ought al&s;o to be &s;uch as will ea&s;ily allow of a convenient pa&s;&s;age of the craft through them. This and the di&s;po&s;ition of it above, &s;o as to ren|der the pa&s;&s;age over it al&s;o convenient, make up its utility.&mdash;Having fixed the heights of the arches, their &s;pans are &s;till nece&s;&s;ary for de|termining their figure. Their &s;pans will be known by dividing the whole breadth of the river into a convenient number of arches and piers, allowing at lea&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary thickne&s;s of
<PB N="5" REF="8">the piers out of the whole. In fixing on the number of arches, take always an odd number, and rather take few and large ones than many and &s;maller, if convenient: For thus you will have not only fewer foundations and piers to make, with fewer arches and centers, which will produce great &s;avings in the expence, but the arches them&s;elves will al&s;o require much le&s;s ma|terials and workman&s;hip, and allow of more and better pa&s;&s;age for the water and craft through them; and will appear at the &s;ame time more noble and beautiful, e&s;pecially if con&s;tructed in elliptical, or in cycloidal forms: for the truth of which it may be &s;ufficient to refer to that noble and elegant bridge lately built at Blackfriars, London, by Mr. Mylne. And here I can't help remarking that the Gentleman who, a few years &s;ince in a pamphlet on the Principles of Bridges, cen&s;ured Mr. Mylne and Mr. Muller concerning elliptic arches, has very much expo&s;ed him&s;elf, and ab&s;urdly critici&s;es them through his own want of mathematical knowledge, which he &s;ome|where in the &s;ame pamphlet affects to de&s;pi&s;e. He brings to my mind an expre&s;&s;ion of (I think) Mr. Henry Fielding &s;omewhere in his works, That a per&s;on does not &s;peak the wor&s;e on a &s;ubject for knowing &s;omething about it. I do not however make this remark through any par|ticular di&s;re&s;pect for this Gentleman, concerning whom I know nothing farther, any more than I do about the other two Gentlemen, but only to
<PB N="6" REF="9">prevent others from being prejudiced and mi&s;led by the authority of his <HI>ip&s;e dixit.</HI>&mdash;If the top of the bridge be a &s;treight horizontal line, let the arches be made all of a &s;ize; if it be a little lower at the ends than the middle, the arches mu&s;t pro|portionally decrea&s;e from the middle towards the ends; but if higher at the ends than the middle, let them increa&s;e towards the ends. A choice of the mo&s;t convenient arches is to be made from the 4th and 5th propo&s;itions, where their &s;everal properties, &amp;c. are demon&s;trated and pointed out; Among them, the elliptic, cycloi|dal, and equilibrial arch in prop. 5, will gene|rally claim the preference, both on account of their &s;trength, beauty, and cheapne&s;s or &s;aving in materials and labour: Other particulars al&s;o concerning them may be &s;een under the word ARCH in the Dictionary in the la&s;t &s;ection, And as the choice of the arch is of &s;o great moment, let no per&s;on, either through ignorance or indo|lence, prefer a wor&s;e arch becau&s;e it may &s;eem to him ea&s;ier to con&s;truct; for he would very ill de&s;erve the name or employment of an Archi|tect, who is incapable of rendering the exact con&s;truction of the&s;e curves ea&s;y and familiar to him&s;elf; but if, by chance, a Bridge-builder &s;hould be employed who is incapable of doing that, he ought at lea&s;t to be endowed with &s;uch a &s;hare of hone&s;ty as to procure &s;ome per&s;on to go through the calculations which he cannot make for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">Next find what thickne&s;s at the key&s;tone or top will be nece&s;&s;ary for the arches. For which &s;ee the word KEYSTONE in the Dictionary in the la&s;t &s;ection.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained all the parts of the arches, with the height of the piers, the nece&s;|&s;ary thickne&s;s of the piers them&s;elves are next to be computed by prop. 10.</P>
<P>This done, the chief and material requi&s;ites are found; the elevation and plans of the de&s;ign can then be drawn, and the calculations of the expence form thence made, including the foun|dations, with &s;uch ornamental or accidental ap|pendages as &s;hall be thought fit; which I &s;hall leave to the di&s;cretion of the Practical Architect, as being no part of the plan of my undertaking, together with the practical methods of carrying the de&s;ign into execution. I &s;hall however, in the Dictionary in the la&s;t &s;ection, not only de|&s;cribe the terms, parts, machines, &amp;c. but al&s;o &s;peak of their dimen&s;ions, properties, and any thing el&s;e material belonging to them; and to which therefore I from hence refer for more ex|plicit information in each particular article, as well as to the&s;e immediately following propo&s;i|tions, in which the theory of the arches, piers, &amp;c. are fully and &s;trictly demon&s;trated.</P>

</FIGURE> however a &s;treight ho|rizontal line IK might be u&s;ed in&s;tead of it, if the materials of which the arch is built, could
<PB N="23" REF="26">be &s;o cho&s;en, as that they might increa&s;e in their &s;pecific gravity from DK towards CI, continually as the cube of the &s;ecant of the arch from D. And this again perhaps would be quite impracticable: But if a circular arch and a right line at the top were <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> required, the proportion of DK to the radius DQ may be found &s;o as the arch may be <HI>nearly</HI> in equilibrium thus:</P>
<P>When KI is a right line, then KR in the figure to the example, mu&s;t be nothing; or ra|ther when the curve cro&s;&s;es the horizontal line, then KR is equal to nothing; put its value then, as found above, equal to o, and we &s;hall have <GAP DESC="math">, and from this equation, by a&s;&s;uming one of the quantities, <HI>a, y,</HI> the corre&s;ponding value of the other may be found for the point where the curve cro&s;&s;es the horizontal line; &s;o from hence the general value of <HI>a</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">. Now this va|lue of <HI>a</HI> or DK evidently becomes &equals; 0 when the arch con&s;i&s;ts of the whole &s;emi-circle; but
<PB N="24" REF="27">when the arch is le&s;s than the &s;emicircle, <HI>a</HI> will have a finite value, and between 60 and 120 de|grees many arches of equilibration of a certain thickne&s;s at top may be found. Thus, if the half arch DC contain 30 degrees; then its &s;ine <HI>y</HI> or PC is &equals; &frac12;<HI>r;</HI> which being &s;ub&s;tituted for it in the above general value of <HI>a,</HI> we have <HI>a</HI> &equals; 7&radic;3&minus;6/37 &times; 3\2 <HI>r,</HI> or &equals; &frac14;<HI>r</HI> extremely near; that is, DK is &equals; &frac14; of DQ or &frac14; of 2PC the &s;pan when the curve cuts the horizontal line directly above the point in the circle which an|&s;wers to 30 degrees. And if DC were an arch of 45 degrees; then <HI>y</HI> &equals; <HI>r</HI>&radic;1/2, and <HI>a</HI> &equals; 3&radic;2&minus;2/14 &times; <HI>r</HI> &equals; 16<HI>r</HI>/100, or 1/9 of the &s;pan nearly.

<PB N="25" REF="28">but a very incon&s;iderable decrea&s;e, and may be very well neglected.&mdash;In the fir&s;t two ca&s;es, the thickne&s;s at the top would be too much; but in the latter one, when the whole arch is 120 degrees, the thickne&s;s is ju&s;t about that which the be&s;t architects now allow; and in greater arches the thickne&s;s would become too little.

And then the re&s;t will be as above.</P>
<P>Now the value of <HI>Q</HI> will be found by writing in this equation &s;ome particular corre&s;pondent known values of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>y:</HI> thus when P arrives at Q, then <HI>x</HI> &equals; DQ &equals; <HI>r,</HI> and <HI>y</HI> &equals; QA &equals; <HI>h;</HI> the&s;e being &s;ub&s;tituted for them, we have <GAP DESC="math">,
<PB N="41" REF="46">and con&s;e|quently <GAP DESC="math">. Wherefore the general value of <HI>y</HI> is thus, <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>Hence, when <HI>Q</HI>^&frac12; is &equals; <HI>a,</HI> the curve DC is the catenary; and in general the ordinate is every|where to the corre&s;ponding ordinate of the cate|nary who&s;e ten&s;ion at the vertex is <HI>a,</HI> as <HI>h</HI> is to <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>If <HI>x</HI> were de&s;ired in terms of <HI>y,</HI> it would be thus. Put <HI>A</HI> &equals; the hyp. log. of <HI>a,</HI> and <GAP DESC="math">; then <GAP DESC="math">: Again, put <HI>N</HI> &equals; the number who&s;e hyp. log. is <HI>Dy</HI> &plus; <HI>A;</HI> then <GAP DESC="math">; and hence <GAP DESC="math">, or <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>x</HI> &equals; KP &equals; <HI>N</HI>^2&plus;<HI>a</HI>^2/2<HI>N.</HI></P>
<P>By taking AQ &equals; <HI>h</HI> &equals; 50, and DQ &equals; <HI>r</HI> &equals; 40, al&s;o DK &equals; <HI>a</HI> &equals; 6. Then the hyp. log.
<PB N="42" REF="47">of <GAP DESC="math"> is &equals; the hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math"> the hyp. log. of 15&middot;26784 &equals; 2&middot;7257487; by which dividing <HI>h</HI> &equals; 50, the quo|tient is 18&middot;343584. So that the ordinate <HI>y</HI> will be con&s;tantly in that ca&s;e equal to 18&middot;343584 &times; the hyp. log. of <GAP DESC="math">. Al&s;o 1/18&middot;343584 &equals; .05451497 is &equals; <HI>D,</HI> and <HI>A</HI> &equals; hyp. log. of 6 &equals; 1&middot;7917594; then <HI>N</HI> &equals; the number who&s;e hyp. log. is 1&middot;7917594 &plus; .05451497<HI>y.</HI> And then by a&s;&s;uming &s;everal values of one of the letters <HI>x, y,</HI> the corre&s;ponding values of the other will be found from one of the two equa|tions above.</P>
<P>And in this manner were calculated the num|bers in the following table; from which the curve being con&s;tructed, it will be as appears in the figure to the example.&mdash;And thus we have an arch in equilibrium in all its parts, and its top a &s;treight line, as is generally required in mo&s;t bridges; or at lea&s;t they are &s;o near a ho|rizontal line, that their difference from it will cau&s;e no &s;en&s;ible ill con&s;equence. It is al&s;o both both of a graceful figure, and of a convenient form for the pa&s;&s;age through it. So that there can be no good rea&s;on for neglecting to u&s;e it in works of any con&s;equence.</P>

<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of this propo&s;ition, the &s;ections of the arch and pier are u&s;ed for their &s;olidities, as being evidently in the &s;ame pro|portion, or in that of their weights, &s;ince they are of the &s;ame length, viz. the breadth of the bridge.</P>
<P>By the above rules, together with tho&s;e in the four preceding propo&s;itions, the nece&s;&s;ary thick|ne&s;s of a pier may be found, &s;o that it &s;hall <HI>ju&s;t</HI> balance the &s;pread or &s;hoot of the arch, independent of any other arch on the other &s;ide of the pier. But the weight of the pier ought a little to preponderate again&s;t or exceed in ef|fect the &s;hoot of the arch; and therefore the thickne&s;s ought to be taken a little more than what will be found by the&s;e rules; unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the pointed projections of the piers again&s;t the &s;tream, beyond the common breadth of the bridge, will be a &s;ufficient addi|tion to the pier, to give it the nece&s;&s;ary pre|ponderancy. &mdash;But there is one very material thing, on account of which the thickne&s;s of the piers may be much dimini&s;hed; viz. by the
<PB N="59" REF="64">&s;tones of the wall above the vou&s;&s;oirs being bonded in with tho&s;e of the pier and with one another, the pier will carry part of their weight; which will not only dimini&s;h the weight of the whole arch and wall, but will al&s;o both add the &s;ame to the weight of the pier, and lengthen the lever EG, by moving the center of gravity a little nearer to L; but then al&s;o M will be a little nearer to Q, &s;o that AM will be longer, and the effects of the change of the centers of gravity may be &s;uppo&s;ed nearly to balance each other.&mdash;In the foregoing propo|&s;itions I have con&s;idered circular arches only, as it will make no difference of any con&s;equence, to &s;uppo&s;e the arches of any other curve of the &s;ame &s;pan and pitch.

<P>ABUTMENT, or BUTMENT, which &s;ee in its place below.</P>
<P>ARCH, and opening of a bridge, through or under which the water, &amp;c. pa&s;&s;es, and which is &s;upported by piers or by butments.</P>
<P>Arches are denominated circular, elliptical, cycloidal, catenarian, &amp;c. according to the figure of the curve of them. There are al&s;o other denominations of circular arches according to the different parts of a circle: So, a &s;emicircular arch is half the circle; a &s;cheme or &s;keen arch is a &s;egment le&s;s than the &s;emicircle; and arches of the third and fourth point, or gothic arches, con&s;i&s;t of two circular arcs, excentric and meet|ing in an angle at top, each being 1-3d or 1-4th, &amp;c. of the whole circle.</P>
<P>The chief properties of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable arches, with regard to the extrados they re|quire, &amp;c. may be learned from the &s;econd &s;ec|tion. It there appears that none, but the arch
<PB N="79" REF="85">of equilibration in the example to prop. 5, can admit of a horizontal line at top; that this arch is not only of a graceful but of a convenient form, as it may be made higher or lower at plea&s;ure with the &s;ame opening; that it, but no other, with a horizontal top, can be equally &s;trong in all its parts, and therefore ought to be u&s;ed in all works of much con&s;equence. All the other arches require tops that are curved either upward or downward, &s;ome more and &s;ome le&s;s: Of the&s;e the elliptical arch &s;eems to be the fitte&s;t to be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of the equilibrial one with any tolerable degree of propriety; it is in general al&s;o the be&s;t form for mo&s;t bridges, as it can be made of any height to the &s;ame &s;pan, or of any &s;pan to the &s;ame height, while at the &s;ame time its hanches are &s;ufficiently ele|vated above the water, even when it is pretty flat at top; which is a property of which the other curves are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame de|gree; and this property is the more valuable, becau&s;e it is remarked that after an arch is built and the centering &s;truck, it &s;ettles more about the hanches than the other parts, by which other curves are reduced near to a &s;treight line at the hanches. Elliptical arches al&s;o look bolder, are really &s;tronger, and require le&s;s ma|terials and labour than the others. Of the other curves, the cycloidal arch is next in quality to the elliptical one, for all the above properties. And, la&s;tly, the circle. As to the others, the
<PB N="80" REF="86">parabola, hyperbola, and catenary, they may not at all be admitted in bridges of &s;everal arches; but may in &s;ome ca&s;es be u&s;ed for a bridge of one &s;ingle arch which is to ri&s;e very high, becau&s;e then not much loaded at the hanches. We may hence al&s;o perceive the fal|&s;ity of tho&s;e arguments which a&s;&s;ert, that be|cau&s;e the catenarian curve &s;upports it&s;elf equally in all its parts, it will therefore be&s;t &s;upport any additional weight laid upon it: for the additional building made to rai&s;e the bridge to a horizontal line, or nearly &s;uch, by pre&s;&s;ing more in one part than another, mu&s;t force tho&s;e parts down, and the whole mu&s;t fall. Whereas other curves will not &s;upport them&s;elves at all without &s;ome additional parts built above them, to balance them, or to reduce their parts to an equilibrium.</P>
<P>ARCHIVOLT, the curve or line formed by the upper &s;ides of the vou&s;&s;oirs or arch &s;tones. It is parallel to the intrados or under&s;ide of the arch when the vou&s;&s;oirs are all of the &s;ame length; otherwi&s;e not.</P>
<P>By the archivolt is al&s;o &s;ometimes under&s;tood the whole &s;et of vou&s;&s;oirs.</P>
<P>BANQUET, the rai&s;ed foot path at the &s;ides of the bridge next the parapet. This ought to be allowed in all bridges of any con&s;iderable
<PB N="81" REF="87">&s;ize: it &s;hould be rai&s;ed about a foot above the middle or hor&s;e pa&s;&s;age, made 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. feet broad according to the &s;ize of the bridge, and paved with large &s;tones who&s;e length is equal to the breadth of the walk.</P>
<P>BATTARDEAU, or <HI>Coffer-dam,</HI> a ca&s;e of pi|ling, &amp;c. without a bottom, fixed in the bed of the river, water-tight or nearly &s;o, by which to lay the bottom dry for a &s;pace large enough to build the pier on. When it is fixed, its &s;ides reaching above the level of the water, the water is pumped out of it, or drawn off by engines, &amp;c. till the &s;pace be dry; and it is kept &s;o by the &s;ame means, if there are leaks which cannot be &s;topped, till the pier is built up in it; and then the materials of it are drawn up again.</P>
<P>Battardeaux are made in various manners, either by a &s;ingle inclo&s;ure, or by a double one, with clay or chalk rammed in between the two, to prevent the water from coming through the &s;ides. And the&s;e inclo&s;ures are al&s;o made either with piles only, driven clo&s;e by one another, and &s;ometimes notched or dove-tailed into each other; or with piles grooved in the &s;ides, driven in at a di&s;tance from one another, and boards let down between them in the grooves.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88">The method of building in battardeaux can|not well be u&s;ed where the river is either deep or rapid. It al&s;o requires a very good natural bottom of &s;olid earth or clay; for, although the &s;ides be made water-tight, if the bottom or bed of the river be of a loo&s;e con&s;i&s;tence, the water will ooze up through it in too great abundance to be evacuated by the engines.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to remark that the &s;ides mu&s;t be made very &s;trong, and well propt or braced in the in&s;ide, to prevent the ambient water from pre&s;&s;ing the &s;ides in, and forcing its way into the battardeau.</P>
<P>BRIDGE, a work of carpentry or ma&s;onry, built over a river, canal, &amp;c. for the conve|niency of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A &s;tone bridge is an edifice forming a way over a river, &amp;c. &s;upported by one arch or by &s;everal arches, and the&s;e again &s;upported by proper piers or butments.</P>
<P>A &s;tately bridge over a large river is one of the mo&s;t noble and &s;triking pieces of art. To behold huge and bold arches, compo&s;ed of an immen&s;e quantity of &s;mall materials, as &s;tones, bricks, &amp;c. &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and united together that
<PB N="83" REF="89">they &s;eem to form but one &s;olid compact body, affording a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age for men and carriages over large waters, which with their navigation pa&s;s free and ea&s;y under them at the &s;ame time, is a &s;ight truly &s;urprizing and affecting indeed.</P>
<P>To the ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary parts of a bridge already mentioned, viz. the arches, piers, and abutments, may be added the paving at top, the parapet wall, either with or without a ba|lu&s;trade, &amp;c. al&s;o the banquet or rai&s;ed foot way on each &s;ide, leaving a &s;ufficient breadth in the middle for hor&s;es and carriages. The breadth of a bridge for a great city &s;hould be &s;uch as to allow an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age for three carriages and two hor&s;emen a-brea&s;t in the middle way, and for three foot pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;ame manner on each banquet. And for other le&s;s bridges a le&s;s breadth.</P>
<P>As a bridge is made for a way or pa&s;&s;age over a river, &amp;c. &s;o it ought to be made of &s;uch a height as will be quite convenient for that pa&s;&s;age; but yet &s;o as to be con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t and concerns of the river it&s;elf, ea&s;ily admitting through its arches the craft that navi|gate upon it, and all the water even at high tides and floods. The neglect of this precept has been the ruin of many bridges, and parti|cularly that at Newca&s;tle, over the river Tyne, on the 17th of november 1771. So that in de|termining
<PB N="84" REF="90">its height, the conveniencies both of the pa&s;&s;age over it and under it &s;hould be con|&s;idered, and the height made to an&s;wer the be&s;t for them both, ob&s;erving to make the <HI>convenient</HI> give place to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> when their intere&s;ts are oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>Bridges are generally placed in a direction perpendicular to the &s;tream in a direct line, to give free pa&s;&s;age to the water, &amp;c. But &s;ome think they &s;hould be made not in a &s;treight line, but convex towards the &s;tream, the better to re&s;i&s;t floods, &amp;c. And &s;ome &s;uch bridges have been made.</P>
<P>Again, a bridge &s;hould not be made in too narrow a part of a navigable river, or one &s;ub|ject to tides or floods: becau&s;e the breadth be|ing &s;till more contracted by the piers, will in|crea&s;e the depth, velocity, and fall of the water under the arches, and endanger the whole bridge and navigation.</P>
<P>The number of arches of a bridge are gene|rally made odd; either that the middle of the &s;tream or chief current may flow freely without the interruption of a pier; or that the two halves of the bridge, by gradually ri&s;ing from the ends to the middle, may there meet in the highe&s;t and large&s;t arch; or el&s;e, for the &s;ake of grace, that by being open in the middle, the eye in
<PB N="85" REF="91">viewing it may look directly through there, as one always expects to do in looking at it, and without which opening one generally feels a di&s;appointment in viewing it.</P>
<P>If the bridge be equally high throughout, the arches, being all of a height, are made all of a &s;ize; which cau&s;es a great &s;aving of centering. If the bridge be higher in the middle than at the ends, let the arches decrea&s;e from the middle to|wards each end, but &s;o as that each half have the arches exactly alike, and that they decrea&s;e in &s;pan, proportionally to their height, &s;o as to be always the &s;ame kind of figure, and &s;imilar parts of that figure: thus, if one be a &s;emicircle, let the re&s;t be &s;emicircles al&s;o, but proportionally le&s;s; if one be a &s;egment of a circle, let the re&s;t be &s;imilar &s;egments of other circles; and &s;o for other figures. The arches being equal at equal di&s;tances on both &s;ides of the middle, is not only for the &s;trength and beauty of the bridge, but that the centering of the one half may &s;erve for the other al&s;o. But if the bridge be higher at the ends than in the middle, the arches ought to increa&s;e in &s;pan and pitch from the middle towards the ends.</P>
<P>When the middle and ends are of different heights, their difference however ought not to be great in proportion to the length, that the a&s;cent may be ea&s;y; and then al&s;o it is more
<PB N="86" REF="92">beautiful to make the top one continued curve than two inclined &s;treight lines from the ends towards the middle.</P>
<P>Bridges &s;hould rather be of few and large arches than of many and &s;mall ones, if the height and &s;ituation will po&s;&s;ibly allow of it; for this will leave more free pa&s;&s;age for the water and navigation, and be a great &s;aving in materials and labour, as there will be fewer piers and centers, and the arches them&s;elves will require le&s;s materials.</P>
<P>For the fabric of a bridge, and the proper e&s;timation of the expence, &amp;c. there are gene|rally nece&s;&s;ary three plans, three &s;ections, and an elevation. The three plans are &s;o many horizontal &s;ections, viz. the fir&s;t a plan of the foundation under the piers, with the particular circum&s;tances attending it, whether of gratings, planks, piles, &amp;c. the &s;econd is the plan of the piers and arches, &amp;c. and the third is the plan of the &s;uper&s;tructure, with the paved road and banquet. The three &s;ections are vertical ones; the fir&s;t of them a longitudinal &s;ection from end to end and through the middle of the breadth; the &s;econd a tran&s;ver&s;e one, or acro&s;s it, and through the &s;ummit of an arch; and the third al&s;o acro&s;s, and taken upon a pier. The eleva|tion is an orthographic projection of one &s;ide or face of the bridge, or its appearance as viewed
<PB N="87" REF="93">at an infinite di&s;tance, and &s;hews the exterior a&s;pect of the materials, and the manner in which they are worked and decorated.</P>
<P>Other ob&s;ervations are to be &s;een in the fir&s;t &s;ection.</P>
<P>BUTMENTS, or <HI>abutments,</HI> the extremities of a bridge, by which it joins to or abuts upon the land or &s;ides of the river, &amp;c. The&s;e mu&s;t be made very &s;ecure, quite immovable, and more than barely &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the drift of its adjacent arch. So that if there are not rocks or very &s;olid banks to rai&s;e them again&s;t, they mu&s;t be well reinforced with proper walls or returns, &amp;c. The thickne&s;s of them that will be barely &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the &s;hoot of the arch, may be calculated as that of a pier by prop. 10.</P>
<P>When the foundation of a butment is rai&s;ed again&s;t a &s;loping bank of rock, gravel, or good &s;olid earth, it will produce a &s;aving of materials and labour, to carry the work on by returns at different heights, like &s;teps of &s;tairs.</P>
<P>CAISSON, a kind of <HI>che&s;t,</HI> or flat-bottomed boat, in which a pier is built, then &s;unk to the bed of the river, and the &s;ides loo&s;ened and taken off from the bottom, by a contrivance for that purpo&s;e; the bottom of it being left
<PB N="88" REF="94">under the pier as a foundation. It is evident therefore that the bottoms of cai&s;&s;ons mu&s;t be made very &s;trong and fit for the foundations of the piers. The cai&s;&s;on is kept a-float till the pier be built to about the height of low-water mark; and for that purpo&s;e its &s;ides mu&s;t either be made of more than that height at fir&s;t, or el&s;e gradually rai&s;ed to it as it &s;inks by the weight of the work, &s;o as always to keep its top above water. And therefore the &s;ides mu&s;t be made very &s;trong, and kept a&s;under by cro&s;s timbers within, le&s;t the great pre&s;&s;ure of the ambient water cru&s;h the &s;ides in, and &s;o not only endanger the work, but al&s;o drown the men who work within it. The cai&s;&s;on is made of the &s;hape of the pier, but &s;ome feet wider on every &s;ide to make room for the men to work: the whole of the &s;ides are of two pieces, both joined to the bottom quite around, and to each other at the &s;alient angle, &s;o as to be di&s;engaged from the bottom and from each other when the pier is rai&s;ed to the de&s;ired height, and &s;unk. It is al&s;o convenient to have a little &s;luice made in the bottom, occa&s;ionally to open and &s;hut, to &s;ink the cai&s;&s;on and pier &s;ometimes by, before it be fini&s;hed, to try if it bottom level and rightly; for by opening the &s;luice, the water will ru&s;h in and fill it to the height of the exterior water, and the weight of the work already built will &s;ink it; then by &s;hutting the &s;luice again, and pumping out the
<PB N="89" REF="95">water, it will be made to float again, and the re&s;t of the work may be completed: but it mu&s;t not be &s;unk but when the &s;ides are high enough to reach above the &s;urface of the water, otherwi&s;e it cannot be rai&s;ed and laid dry again. Mr. Labelye tells us that the cai&s;&s;ons in which he built &s;ome of the piers of We&s;tmin&s;ter bridge, contained above 150 load of fir timber of 40 cubic feet each, and was of more tonnage or capacity than a 40 gun &s;hip of war.</P>
<P>CENTERS, are the timber frames erected in the &s;paces of the arches to turn them on, by building on them the vou&s;&s;oirs of the arch. As the center &s;erves as a foundation for the arch to be built on, when the arch is completed, that foundation is &s;truck from under it, to make way for the water and navigation, and then the arch will &s;tand of it&s;elf from its curved fi|gure. A center mu&s;t therefore be con&s;tructed of the exact figure of the intended arch, convex as the arch is concave, to receive it on as a mould. If the form be circular, the curve is &s;truck from a central point by a radius: if it be elliptical, it ought to be &s;truck with a dou|bled cord, pa&s;&s;ing over two pins or nails fixed in the focu&s;&s;es, as the mathematicians de&s;cribe their ellip&s;es; and not by &s;triking different pieces or arcs of circles from &s;everal centers; for the&s;e will form no ellip&s;e at all, but an irregular mi&s;|&s;hapen curve made up of broken pieces of dif|ferent
<PB N="90" REF="96">circular arcs: but if the arch be of any other form, the &s;everal ab&s;ci&s;&s;as and ordinates ought to be calculated, then their corre&s;ponding lengths, transferred to the centering, will give &s;o many points of the curve, and exactly by which points bending a bow of pliable matter, the curve may be drawn by it.</P>
<P>The centers are con&s;tructed of beams, &amp;c. of timber firmly pinned and bound together, into one entire compact frame, covered &s;mooth at top with planks or boards to place the vou&s;&s;oirs on, the whole &s;upported by offsets in the &s;ides of the piers, and by piles driven into the bed of the river, and capable of being rai&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed by wedges, contrived for that purpo&s;e, and for taking them down when the arch is completed. They ought al&s;o to be con&s;tructed of a &s;trength more than &s;ufficient to bear the weight of the arch.</P>
<P>In taking the center down; fir&s;t let it down a little, all in a piece, by ea&s;ing &s;ome of the wedges; there let it re&s;t a few hours or days to try if the arch make any efforts to fall, or any joints open, or &s;tones cru&s;h or crack, &amp;c. that the damage may be repaired before the center is entirely removed, which is not to be done till the arch cea&s;es to make any vi&s;ible efforts.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="97">In &s;ome bridges the centering makes a very con&s;iderable part of the expence, and therefore all means of &s;aving in this article ought to be clo&s;ely attended to; &s;uch as making few arches, and as nearly alike or &s;imilar as po&s;&s;ible, that the centering of one arch may &s;erve for others, and at lea&s;t that the &s;ame center may be u&s;ed for both of each pair of equal arches on both &s;ides of the middle.</P>
<P>CHEST, the &s;ame as <HI>Cai&s;&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>COFFERDAM, the &s;ame as <HI>Battardeau.</HI></P>
<P>DRIFT, <HI>Shoot,</HI> or <HI>Thru&s;t</HI> of an arch, is the pu&s;h or force which it exerts in the direction of the length of the bridge. This force ari&s;es from the perpendicular gravitation of the &s;tones of the arch, which, being kept from de&s;cending by the form of the arch and the re&s;i&s;tance of the pier, exert their force in a lateral or hori|zontal direction. This force is computed in prop. 10, where the thickne&s;s of the pier is de|termined that is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;i&s;t it; and is greater the lower the arch is, <HI>coeteris paribus.</HI></P>
<P>ELEVATION, the orthographic projection of the front of a bridge on the vertical plane pa|rallel to its length. This is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the form and dimen&s;ions of the arches and other
<PB N="92" REF="98">parts as to height and breadth, and therefore has a plain &s;cale annexed to it to mea&s;ure the parts by. It al&s;o &s;hews the manner of working up and decorating the fronts of the bridge.</P>
<P>EXTRADOS, the exterior curvature or line of an arch. In the propo&s;itions of the &s;econd &s;ection it is the outer or upper line of the wall above the arch; but it often means only the upper or exterior curve of the vou&s;&s;oirs.</P>
<P>FOUNDATIONS, the bottoms of the piers, &amp;c. or the ba&s;es on which they are built. The&s;e bottoms are always to be made with projections, greater or le&s;s according to the &s;paces on which they are built. And according to the nature of the ground, depth and velocity of water, &amp;c. the foundations are laid and the piers built after different manners, either in cai&s;&s;ons, in battar|deaux, on &s;tilts with &s;terlings, &amp;c. for the par|ticular methods of doing which, &s;ee each under its re&s;pective term.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious and &s;imple method of lay|ing the foundations and rai&s;ing the piers up to water-mark, is to turn the river out of its cour&s;e above the place of the bridge, into a new channel cut for it near the place where it makes an elbow or turn; then the piers are built on dry ground, and the water turned into its old cour&s;e again, the new one being &s;ecurely banked
<PB N="93" REF="99">up. This is certainly the be&s;t method, when the new channel can be ea&s;ily and conveniently made; but which however is &s;eldom or never the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Another method is to lay only the &s;pace of each pier dry till it be built, by &s;urrounding it with piles and planks driven down into the bed of the river, &s;o clo&s;e together as to exclude the water from coming in; then the water is pumped out of the inclo&s;ed &s;pace, the pier built in it, and la&s;tly the piles and planks drawn up. This is coffer-dam work, but evidently cannot be practi&s;ed if the bottom be of a loo&s;e con|&s;i&s;tence admitting the water to ooze and &s;pring up through it.</P>
<P>When neither the whole nor part of the river can be ea&s;ily laid dry as above, other methods are to be u&s;ed; &s;uch as to build either in cai&s;|&s;ons or on &s;tilts, both which methods are de|&s;cribed under their proper words; or yet by another method, which hath, though &s;eldom, been &s;ometimes u&s;ed, without laying the bottom dry, and which is thus: the pier is built upon &s;trong rafts or gratings of timber well bound together, and buoyed up on the &s;urface of the water by &s;trong cables, fixed to other flotes or machines, till the pier is built; the whole is then gently let down to the bottom, which mu&s;t be made level for the purpo&s;e. But of
<PB N="94" REF="100">the&s;e methods, that of building in cai&s;&s;ons is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>But before the pier can be built in any man|ner, the ground at the bottom mu&s;t be well &s;ecured, and made quite good and &s;afe if it be not &s;o naturally. The &s;pace mu&s;t be bored into to try the con&s;i&s;tence of the ground; and if a good bottom of &s;tone, or firm gravel, clay, &amp;c. be met with within a moderate depth below the bed of the river, the loo&s;e &s;and, &amp;c. mu&s;t be removed and digged out to it, and the foun|dation laid on the firm bottom on a &s;trong gra|ting or ba&s;e of timber made much broader every way than the pier, that there may be the greater ba&s;e to pre&s;s on, to prevent its being &s;unk. But if a &s;olid bottom cannot be found at a conve|nient depth to dig to, the &s;pace mu&s;t then be driven full of &s;trong piles, who&s;e tops mu&s;t be &s;awed off level &s;ome feet below the bed of the water, the &s;and having been previou&s;ly digged out for that purpo&s;e; and then the foundation on a grating of timber laid on their tops as before. Or, when the bottom is not good, if it be made level, and a &s;trong grating of tim|ber, two, three, or four times as large as the ba&s;e of the pier be made, it will form a good ba&s;e to bulid on, its great &s;ize preventing it from &s;inking. In driving the piles, begin at the mid|dle, and proceed outwards all the way to the borders or margin: the rea&s;on of which is, that
<PB N="95" REF="101">if the outer ones were driven fir&s;t, the earth of the inner &s;pace would be thereby &s;o jammed together, as not to allow the inner piles to be driven. And be&s;ides the piles immediately under the piers, it is al&s;o very prudent to drive in a &s;ingle, double, or triple row of them around and clo&s;e to the frame of the foundation, cutting them off a little above it, to &s;ecure it from &s;lipping a&s;ide out of its place, and to bind the ground under the pier the firmer. For, as the &s;afety of the whole bridge depends on the foun|dation, too much care cannot be u&s;ed to have the bottom made quite &s;ecure.</P>
<P>JETTEE, the border made around the &s;tilts under a pier, being the &s;ame with <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>IMPOST, is the part of the pier on which the feet of the arches &s;tand, or from which whey &s;pring.</P>
<P>KEYSTONE, the middle vou&s;&s;oir, or the arch &s;tone in the top or immediately over the center of the arch. The length of the key&s;tone, or thickne&s;s of the archivolt at top, is allowed to be about 1-15th or 1-16th of the &s;pan, by the be&s;t architects.</P>
<P>ORTHOGRAPHY, the elevation of a bridge, or front view as &s;een at an infinite di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102">PARAPET, the brea&s;t wall made on the top of a bridge to prevent pa&s;&s;engers from falling over. In good bridges, to build the parapet but a little part of its height clo&s;e or &s;olid, and upon that a balu&s;trade to above a man's height, has an elegant effect.</P>
<P>PIERS, the walls built for the &s;upport of the arches, and from which they &s;pring as their ba&s;es.</P>
<P>They ought to be built of large blocks of &s;tone, &s;olid throughout, and cramped together with iron, which will make the whole as one &s;olid &s;tone. Their faces or ends, from the ba&s;e up to high-water mark, ought to project &s;harp out with a &s;alient angle, to divide the &s;tream. Or, perhaps, the bottom of the pier &s;hould be built flat or &s;quare up to about half the height of low-water mark, to allow a lodgment again&s;t it for the &s;and and mud, to cover the founda|tion; le&s;t, by being left bare, the water &s;hould in time undermine and &s;o ruin or injure it. The be&s;t form of the projection for dividing the &s;tream, is the triangle; and the longer it is, or the more acute the &s;alient angle, the better it will divide it, and the le&s;s will the force of the water be again&s;t the pier; but it may be &s;uffi|cient to make that angle a right one, as it will make the work &s;tronger, and in that ca&s;e the
<PB N="97" REF="103">perpendicular projection will be equal to half the breadth or thickne&s;s of the pier. In rivers on which large heavy craft navigate and pa&s;s the arches, it may perhaps be better to make the ends &s;emicircular; for although it does not di|vide the water &s;o well as the triangle, it will both better turn off and bear the &s;hock of the craft.</P>
<P>The thickne&s;s of the piers ought to be &s;uch as will make them of weight or &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport their interjacent arch independent of any other arches. And then if the middle of the pier be run up to its full height, the centering may be &s;truck to be u&s;ed in another arch before the hanches are filled up. The whole theory of the piers may be &s;een in the third &s;ection.</P>
<P>They ought to be made with a broad bottom on the foundation, and gradually dimini&s;hed in thickne&s;s by offsets up to low-water mark.</P>
<P>The methods of laying their foundations, and building them up to the &s;urface of the water, are given under the word FOUNDATION.</P>
<P>PILES, are timbers driven into the bed of the river for various purpo&s;es, and are either round, &s;quare, or flat like planks. They may be of any wood which will not rot under water, but oak and fir are mo&s;tly u&s;ed, e&s;pecially the latter, on account of its length, &s;treightne&s;s, and
<PB N="98" REF="104">cheapne&s;s. They are &s;hod with a pointed iron at the bottom, the better to penetrate into the ground; and are bound with a &s;trong iron band or ring at top, to prevent them from being &s;plit by the violent &s;trokes of the ram by which they are driven down.</P>
<P>Piles are either u&s;ed to build the foundations on, or are driven about the pier as a border of defence, or to &s;upport the centers on; and in this ca&s;e, when the centering is removed, they mu&s;t either be drawn up or &s;awed off very low under water; but it is perhaps better to &s;aw them off and leave them &s;ticking in the bot|tom, le&s;t the drawing of them out &s;hould loo&s;en the ground about the foundation of the pier. Tho&s;e to build on, are either &s;uch as are cut off by the bottom of the water, or rather a few feet within the bed of the river; or el&s;e &s;uch as are cut off at low-water mark, and then they are called &s;tilts. Tho&s;e to form borders of defence, are rows driven in clo&s;e by the frame of a foundation, to keep it firm; or el&s;e they are to form a ca&s;e or jettee about &s;tilts, to keep within it the &s;tones that are thrown in to fill it up; in this ca&s;e, the piles are grooved, driven at a little di&s;tance from each other, and plank piles let into the grooves between them, and driven down al&s;o, till the whole &s;pace is &s;ur|rounded. Be&s;ides u&s;ing this for &s;tilts, it is al&s;o &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urround a &s;tone pier
<PB N="99" REF="105">with a &s;terling or jettee, and fill it up with &s;tones to &s;ecure an injured pier from being &s;till more damaged, and the whole bridge ruined. The piles to &s;upport the centers may al&s;o &s;erve as a border of piling to &s;ecure the foundation, cutting them off low enough after the center is removed.</P>
<P>PILE DRIVER, and engine for driving down the piles. It con&s;i&s;ts of a large ram of iron &s;liding perpendicularly down between two guide po&s;ts; which being lift up to the top of them, and there let fall from a great height, comes down upon the top of the pile with a violent blow. It is worked either with men or hor&s;es, and either with or without wheel-work. That which was u&s;ed at the building of We&s;tmin&s;ter bridge, is perhaps the be&s;t ever invented.</P>
<P>PITCH, of an arch, the perpendicular height from the &s;pring or impo&s;t to the key&s;tone.</P>
<P>PLAN, of any part, as of the foundations, or piers, or &s;uper&s;tructure, is the orthographic projection of it on a plane paralled to the ho|rizon.</P>
<P>PUSH, of any arch, the &s;ame as drift, &s;hoot, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106">SALIENT ANGLE, of a pier, the projection of the end again&s;t the &s;tream, to divide it. The right-lined angle be&s;t divides the &s;tream, and the more acute the better for that purpo&s;e; but the right angle is generally u&s;ed as making the be&s;t ma&s;onry. A &s;emicircular end, though it does not divide the &s;tream &s;o well, is &s;ometimes better in large navigable rivers, as it carries the craft the better off, or bears their &s;hocks the better.</P>
<P>SHOOT, of an arch, the &s;ame as drift.</P>
<P>SPRINGERS, are the fir&s;t or lowe&s;t &s;tones of an arch, being tho&s;e at its feet bearing im|mediately on the impo&s;t.</P>
<P>STERLINGS, or Jettees, a kind of ca&s;e made about a pier of &s;tilts, &amp;c. to &s;ecure it, and is particularly de&s;cribed under the next word <HI>Stilts.</HI></P>
<P>STILTS, a &s;et of piles driven into the &s;pace intended for the pier, who&s;e tops being &s;awed level of about low-water mark, the pier is then rai&s;ed on them. This method was formerly u&s;ed when the bottom of the river could not be laid dry; and the&s;e &s;tilts were &s;urrounded, at a few feet di&s;tance, by a row of piles and planks, &amp;c. clo&s;e to them like a coffer-dam, and called a &s;terling or jettee; after which loo&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="107">&s;tones, &amp;c. are thrown or poured down into the &s;pace till it be filled up to the top, by that means forming a kind of pier of rub|ble or loo&s;e work, and which is kept together by the &s;ides or &s;terlings: this is then paved level at the top, and the arches turned upon it. This method was formerly much u&s;ed, mo&s;t of the large old bridges in England being e|rected that way, &s;uch as London bridge, New|ca&s;tle bridge, Roche&s;ter bridge, &amp;c. But the inconveniencies attending it are &s;o great, that it is now quite exploded and di&s;u&s;ed: for, be|cau&s;e of the loo&s;e compo&s;ition of the piers, they mu&s;t be made very large or broad, or el&s;e the arch would pu&s;h them over and ru&s;h down as &s;oon as the center was drawn; which great breadth of piers and &s;terlings &s;o much contracts the pa&s;&s;age of the water, as not only very much incommodes the navigation through the arch, from the fall and quick motion of the water, but from the &s;ame cau&s;e al&s;o the bridge it&s;elf is in much danger, e&s;pecially in time of floods, when the water is too much for the pa&s;&s;age. Add to this that be&s;ides the danger there is of the pier bur&s;ting out the &s;terlings, they are al&s;o &s;ubject to much decay and damage by the velocity of the water and the craft pa&s;&s;ing through the arches.</P>
<P>THRUST, the &s;ame as drift, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="108">VOUSSOIRS, the &s;tones which immediately form the arch, their under &s;ides con&s;tituting the intrados. The middle one, or key&s;tone, ought to be about 1-15th or 1-16th of the &s;pan, as has been ob&s;erved; and the re&s;t &s;hould in|crea&s;e in &s;ize all the way down to the impo&s;t; the more they increa&s;e the better, as they will the better bear the great weight which re&s;ts upon them without being cru&s;hed, and al&s;o will bind the firmer together. Their joints &s;hould al&s;o be cut perpendicular to the curve of the intrados.</P>
