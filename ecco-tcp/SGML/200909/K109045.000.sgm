<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the following Tract is to prove that the plea of <HI>&s;udden Anger</HI> can|not remove the imputation and guilt of <HI>Murder,</HI> when a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> is <HI>wil|fully</HI> given <HI>with a weapon:</HI></P>
<P>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Man&s;laughter</HI> in Rencounters, and in &s;udden Affrays and Duels, is <HI>indi&s;|criminate,</HI> and without foundation in Law:</P>
<P>And that <HI>impunity</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es of <HI>volun|tary Man&s;laughter</HI> is one of the principal cau&s;es of the <HI>continuance</HI> and pre&s;ent <HI>in|crea&s;e</HI> of the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> and <HI>di&s;graceful</HI> practice of Duelling.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al Benevolence, including <HI>gentle|ne&s;s, patience</HI> and an unaffected <HI>placa|bility</HI> in our behaviour, even towards tho&s;e
<PB N="iv" REF="5">men who injure and affront us, is manife&s;tly required of all men, who profe&s;s the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Chri&s;tian world, this mo&s;t obvious doctrine of the <HI>go&s;pel of peace,</HI> is too commonly either mi&s;|under&s;tood, or el&s;e ab&s;olutely rejected, though the <HI>temporal</HI> as well as the <HI>eternal happi|ne&s;s</HI> of mankind, greatly depends upon a con&s;cientious and proper ob&s;ervation of it. For a man cannot be a true Chri&s;tian with|out ob&s;erving this doctrine; and yet, &s;o generally received is the oppo&s;ite and contra|dictory doctrine, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of revenging every per&s;onal affront with &s;word and pi&s;tol, for the &s;ake of, what is fal&s;ely called, <HI>honour,</HI> that a true Chri&s;tian is rarely to be with! Nay, we are fallen into &s;uch gro&s;s depravity, that the writer of a late publication on <HI><Q>the principles of penal law,</Q></HI> has ventured to a&s;&s;ert, (tho' he is in other re&s;pects, as I am informed, a &s;en&s;ible and ingenious young gentleman) that <Q>the judge condemns the duelli&s;t, whil&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="6">he &s;carcely knows how in his own heart to di&s;approve his behaviour.</Q> (p. 224.) So that one would &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;tianity to be almo&s;t entirely extinct among&s;t us, if its principles are &s;o little regarded, <HI>even in our courts of ju&s;tice,</HI> where they ought to be held <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred.</HI> My readers, perhaps, will &s;tart at &s;uch an idea in the&s;e enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go farther, and venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the Europeans not only cea&s;e to be Chri&s;tians, but will no longer de&s;erve the name even of <HI>men,</HI> if they per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the mo&s;t indi&s;|pen&s;ible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing de&s;erves to be e&s;teemed <HI>human</HI> that is <HI>unrea&s;onable;</HI> and the de|pravity, of which I complain, is not only incompatible with the laws of God, but ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>common &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Let us view the character of the <HI>mo|dern man of honour</HI> (fal&s;ely &s;o called)
<PB N="vi" REF="7">who thinks it incon&s;i&s;tent with his reputa|tion, to pa&s;s over a per&s;onal affront with that Chri&s;tian &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which the go&s;pel requires of all men, without exception.</P>
<P>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <HI>honour</HI> obliges him, whenever he re|ceives an affront, to <HI>call out</HI> his adver&s;ary, or <HI>to accept his challenge,</HI> le&s;t his <HI>courage</HI> &s;hould be que&s;tioned; and therefore in &s;uch ca&s;e, the one mu&s;t give, and the other take, what is commonly called <HI>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</HI> But let us examine this per|ver&s;ion of words. The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to both parties is the ri&s;k both of <HI>body</HI> and <HI>&s;oul,</HI> in the perpetration of a mo&s;t <HI>di&s;honourable, ba&s;e,</HI> and <HI>cowardly felony;</HI> which cannot, therefore, be <HI>gentleman-like,</HI> whatever the <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of it may be. And 1&s;t. It is <HI>Felony;</HI> becau&s;e no man can give, or accept, a challenge, without being guilty of <HI>Wilful Murder,</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antagoni&s;t; which I hope is proved in the cour&s;e of the
<PB N="vii" REF="8">following tract. 2ndly. It is <HI>di&s;honour|able,</HI> becau&s;e it is an open violation of the indi&s;pen&s;ible principles enjoined in the two great commandments of the &s;upreme Law, viz. the <HI>love of God,</HI> and the <HI>love of our neighbour:</HI> for, in this re&s;pect, the offender is upon the &s;ame footing as culprits for <HI>bur|glary, theft,</HI> or any other felony; the <Q><HI>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</HI></Q> being equally applicable to all of them; and the common law of England e&s;teems no man qualified to be a member of &s;ociety, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <HI>di&s;honourable;</HI> and to u&s;e a &s;till more humi|liating term of the &s;ame import, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve&mdash;3dly, that it is al&s;o <HI>ba&s;e;</HI> becau&s;e it affords the mo&s;t apparent proof of a <HI>little Soul<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nec Chri&s;tiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, &s;ed et philo&s;ophi, qui dixerunt <HI>pu&s;illi e&s;&s;e animi contume|liam ferre non po&s;&s;e,</HI> ut alibi o&s;tendimus,</Q> &s;ays the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</NOTE>;</HI> being, <HI>in reality,</HI> a <HI>brutal</HI> revenge;
<PB N="viii" REF="9"><HI>brutal</HI> becau&s;e <HI>unrea&s;onable;</HI> (for how can <HI>Honour</HI> be vindicated or retrieved by the commi&s;&s;ion of a <HI>notorious Felony?</HI>) and what is <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;graceful to human nature, and therefore is truly <HI>ba&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it is <HI>cowardly</HI> (that is, when it cannot be imputed to <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Folly</HI>) becau&s;e a man &s;ubmits to it contrary to the light of his own rea&s;on, <HI>for fear</HI> his <HI>courage</HI> &s;hould be called in que&s;tion; and yet <HI>he has not courage enough</HI> to with&s;tand the bar|barous prejudices of a depraved world, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;ome temporal inconveniencies: and the <HI>&s;lavi&s;h Fear</HI> which he entertains of the&s;e (for <HI>cowards</HI> always dread the pre|&s;ent evil mo&s;t) deprives him of that <HI>rea&s;on|able fear,</HI> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, becau&s;e he thinks it at a di&s;tance, though, he knows, it mu&s;t inevit|ably follow!&mdash;I condemn no man in parti|cular; God forbid! I &s;peak of the que&s;tion
<PB N="ix" REF="10">only in general: inveterate prejudices and cu&s;toms may perhaps afford &s;ome excu&s;e in particular ca&s;es to &s;ome <HI>individuals,</HI> who have <HI>ignorantly</HI> yielded thereto: but as <HI>ignorance</HI> is di&s;graceful to <HI>humanity,</HI> I &s;incerely wi&s;h that all per&s;ons may enter into as careful an examination of this que&s;tion as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but al&s;o be prevented from attempting to defend what is pa&s;t, and thereby afford the be&s;t proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</P>
<P>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul|gence which our Engli&s;h courts of ju&s;tice, for about two centuries back, have &s;hewn to per&s;ons <HI>convicted of killing in &s;udden affrays and rencounters,</HI> through a fal&s;e idea of mercy due to human failty, in ca&s;es
<PB N="x" REF="11">of <HI>&s;udden provocation;</HI> without pre&s;erving the proper di&s;tinction of tho&s;e ca&s;es wherein homicide, in <HI>&s;udden anger,</HI> is really excu|&s;able by the laws of God, and of this king|dom; and the <HI>improper precedents,</HI> which have ari&s;en from this <HI>indi&s;criminate and corrupt practice,</HI> have &s;o mi&s;led the more modern writers on <HI>Crown Law,</HI> that even the greate&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doc|trines on the &s;ubject of Man&s;laughter, which are ab&s;olutely incompatible with the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions</HI> to be ob|&s;erved between <HI>wilful murder</HI> and <HI>man|&s;laughter,</HI> which they them&s;elves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of the&s;e ju&s;t <HI>di&s;tinctions,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences ari&s;ing therefrom, (and not on my own pre&s;umption) that this cen&s;ure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon|&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="12">But as my readers might &s;eem to give too much credit to an incon&s;iderable per&s;on like my&s;elf, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is propo&s;ed,) to ri&s;que any lo&s;s of time in the peru&s;al of the argu|ments and proofs at large, on which my vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to &s;tate the &s;ubject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre|fatory addre&s;s, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much lo&s;s of time, whether the matter is of &s;uf|ficient con&s;equence to merit any more of their attention.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <Q>No man can give or accept a challenge to fight <HI>with weapons,</HI> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <HI>wilful murder</HI> if he <HI>kills</HI> his antag|oni&s;t.</Q> And the intention of the follow|ing tract is to &s;hew, that the writers on Crown Law have no ju&s;t warrant for ad|mitting
<PB N="xii" REF="13">the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <HI>&s;udden affrays</HI> and <HI>rencountres, viz.</HI> that <HI>the voluntary killing</HI> of a man on a <HI>&s;udden provocation</HI> is only to be e&s;teemed <HI>Man&s;laughter,</HI> and, as &s;uch, is intitled to the benefit of Clergy. And they have al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>an a&s;&s;ault</HI> is a &s;ufficient provocation to ju&s;tify a <HI>volun|tary man&s;laughter.</HI></P>
<P>Now, certain it is; that &s;ome allow|ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <HI>&s;udden provocation,</HI> in con&s;idera|tion of the extreme frailty of human na|ture; provided that there are no circum|&s;tances of <HI>malice</HI> in the ca&s;e. As if (for in&s;tance) a man, <HI>in &s;udden anger,</HI> &s;hould &s;trike another, merely <HI>with his fi&s;t,</HI> or a &s;mall <HI>cane,</HI> or <HI>&s;tick,</HI> meaning only to cor|rect, and &s;hould <HI>accidentally kill;</HI> this would be, properly, <HI>man&s;laughter;</HI> which, though it is deemed <HI>Felony</HI> (as the act of &s;triking, or beating another per&s;on is, in
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">it&s;elf, <HI>unlawful</HI>), is neverthele&s;s <HI>pardona|ble</HI> both by the laws of God and man. But when two per&s;ons fight with <HI>dangerous weapons,</HI> an <HI>intention of killing</HI> is <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;ed</HI> by the <HI>weapons;</HI> and <HI>&s;uch inten|tion</HI> renders the man&s;laughter <HI>voluntary,</HI> which is the &s;ame thing as <HI>wilful;</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>"malice prepen&s;ed"</HI> (which excludes the benefit of clergy) is nece&s;&s;arily <HI>implied,</HI> though the &s;udden anger be but a moment before the fatal &s;troke; for <HI>"malice prepen&s;ed"</HI> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <Q>That is (&s;ays he) <HI>volun|tary,</HI> and of &s;et purpo&s;e, though done <HI>upon a &s;udden occa&s;ion:</HI> for if it be <HI>voluntary</HI> the law implieth <HI>malice.</HI> <BIBL><HI>3</HI> In&s;t. <HI>c.xiii. p. 62.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And yet the &s;ame great lawyer in p. <HI>55,</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>voluntary man&s;laughter</HI> upon <HI>&s;ome &s;udden falling out,</HI> as di&s;tinct from <HI>murder;</HI> which cannot, in rea&s;on, be true; for if the <HI>killing be voluntary,</HI> the evil
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">and <HI>malicious intention</HI> is nece&s;&s;arily in|cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <HI>the hand,</HI> or a <HI>&s;mall cane</HI> or <HI>&s;tick,</HI> which I have before mentioned as pardonable ca&s;es, when the <HI>killing</HI> is not intended; for a <HI>voluntary &s;triking,</HI> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death en&s;ues; but a <HI>vo|luntary killing</HI> is &s;o far from being &s;o, that the law, according to Lord Coke's own rule, <HI>implieth malice;</HI> and, con&s;equently, the &s;ame mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, be e&s;teemed <HI>Murder,</HI> and not merely <HI>Man&s;laughter;</HI> becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary marks, whereby <HI>man&s;laughter</HI> ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, are ab&s;olutely wanting therein: for <HI>man&s;laughter</HI> mu&s;t be "without <HI>malice</HI> expre&s;s or implied" (<HI>1</HI> Hale <HI>466. 4</HI> Black&s;tone <HI>191</HI>) "<HI>Murder</HI> being aggravated" (&s;ays Lord Hale) <Q>with ma|lice pre&s;umed or <HI>implied,</HI> but man&s;laghter not.</Q> And yet all the&s;e great and excellent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the &s;ame error of treating the <HI>voluntary branch</HI> of
<PB N="xv" REF="16">killing, as bare <HI>Homicide,</HI> or <HI>man&s;laugh|ter;</HI> whereas, all the older writers agree, that <HI>killing</HI> is pardonable only in ca&s;es <HI>of inevitable nece&s;&s;ity</HI> (Bracton, lib. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>120.</HI> b. Fleta lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>23.</HI>) And the learned Judge Staunford &s;ays <Q>That the whole matter con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>inevitable ne|ce&s;&s;ity;</HI> without which the <HI>killing</HI> is by <HI>no means excu&s;able</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">There is but one ca&s;e of <HI>voluntary Killing,</HI> wherein the plea of <HI>&s;udden Anger</HI> and atrocious provocation may &s;eem entitled to &s;ome indulgence and con&s;ideration: See Note in p. 46.</NOTE> (n'e&s;t a&s;cun voi ex|cu&s;able.</Q> P.C. lib. <HI>i.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI>)</P>
<P>Now, the ab&s;urd and depraved notions of <HI>honour,</HI> and <HI>gentleman-like &s;atisfaction,</HI> of which I complain, could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, if every conqueror in a duel, who kills his antagoni&s;t, was &s;ure of being <HI>hanged up</HI> as an ignominious <HI>felon,</HI> for his own <HI>gen|tleman-like &s;atisfaction;</HI> and therefore I apprehend, that the diabolical practice of &s;ettling private differences with &s;word and
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">pi&s;tol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of puni&s;hment due to <HI>voluntary man&s;laugh|ter,</HI> through the mi&s;taken conce&s;&s;ions of the Writers on Crown Law, and the fal&s;e mercy of Juries, in con&s;ideration of <HI>&s;udden anger;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>impunity</HI> fo&s;ters vice and depravity; but more e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of <HI>wilful man&s;laughter,</HI> impunity ought to be e&s;teemed the bane of &s;ociety; as <HI>the guilt of blood</HI> is thereby thrown upon a whole nation or country; for it is a &s;upreme law, that <Q>who&s;o &s;heddeth <HI>man's blood,</HI> by <HI>man</HI> &s;hall <HI>his blood</HI> be &s;hed. Gen. <HI>ix. 6.</HI> For <HI>blood</HI> it defileth the <HI>Land:</HI> and the <HI>Land</HI> cannot be clean&s;ed of <HI>the Blood that</HI> is &s;hed therein, but <HI>by the Blood of him that &s;hed it.</HI></Q> <HI>(Num. xxxv. 33.)</HI> And I hope I have proved by incontrovert|able extracts from the laws of God, that the &s;aid judgment is inevitably incurred by all <HI>voluntary killing,</HI> except in the legal pro|&s;ecution of ju&s;tice, and in the nece&s;&s;ary de|fence of our lives and properties; &s;o that <HI>no
<PB N="xvii" REF="18">man</HI> has any legal or ju&s;t right to pardon or re|mit the puni&s;hment due to <HI>murder,</HI> or <HI>volun|tary man&s;laughter</HI> (which are the &s;ame crime, and equally <HI>unpardonable</HI> in this world); for &s;uch an indulgence is not only a manife&s;t &s;in again&s;t Almighty God, but al&s;o again&s;t the community at large, or <HI>country;</HI> <Q>for <HI>Blood</HI> it defileth the <HI>land;</HI> and the <HI>land</HI> cannot be clean&s;ed of <HI>the blood</HI> that is &s;hed therein, but <HI>by the blood of him that &s;hed it.</HI></Q> Numb. <HI>xxxv. 33.</HI> This is not a ceremonial law, but a law of morality, founded in <HI>divine Ju&s;tice,</HI> which mu&s;t, there|fore, be ever binding. Now as <Q>the <HI>Land cannot be clean&s;ed, &amp;c. but by<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>man&s;laughter,</HI> &s;o that even <HI>the king him&s;elf</HI> is ab&s;olutely re&s;trained from it. See an act of the 2 Edw. III. whereby it is ordained, that a charter of pardon <Q>&s;hall not be granted, but only where the king may do it by his oath; that is to &s;ay, where a man &s;layeth an|other in <HI>his own defence,</HI> or <HI>by misfortune.</HI></Q> See al&s;o a Note in p. 48. on the further limitation of Royal Pre|rogative by a &s;ub&s;equent Statute of 13 Ric. 2. (2 Stat. c. 1.) rendering it obnoxious to <HI>the wrath of God!</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">the blood of him who &s;hed it,</HI></Q> the <HI>Land</HI> is &s;urely entitled to that expiation, as a matter of <HI>indi&s;pen&s;ible Right,</HI> which, when with|held or withdrawn by <HI>Charters of Pardon</HI> to the guilty, is a manife&s;t <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> to the <HI>land,</HI> i.e. to the whole Country or Kingdom; which opens to us the true ground and rea&s;on why the Royal Prerogative is &s;o &s;trictly and expre&s;sly limited in this point; for <Q><HI>Non pote&s;t Rex gratiam facere cum injuri&acirc; et damno aliorum:</HI></Q> This is an ancient and con&s;tant rule "of Law." <HI>(3 In&s;t. p. 236.)</HI> and an <HI>injury, wrong,</HI> or <HI>da|mage</HI> is &s;urely <HI>mo&s;t intolerable,</HI> when it is liable to affect the whole <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> by r&egrave;ndering it obnoxious to <HI>the wrath of God!</HI></P>
<P>I may probably be charged with an unpar|donable temerity for pre&s;uming to cen&s;ure the writings of &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned men that this nation, perhaps, ever produced; and I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="xix" REF="20">the ri&s;k and ill con&s;equences to my&s;elf, in ca&s;e I am mi&s;taken; but a &s;incere per&s;ua&s;ion of being in the right, (ari&s;ing from a laborious re&s;earch and careful examination of the mo&s;t cele|brated and approved writers on Crown Law) obliges me to prefer, what I conceive to be <HI>truth,</HI> before the authority of the greate&s;t names.</P>
<P>And even, though I &s;hould not have &s;uc|ceeded according to my own conceptions of the &s;ubject, yet, I tru&s;t, that my impartial readers will pardon any <HI>involuntary errors,</HI> that they find in the performance, e&s;pecially if they &s;ee no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect any want of uprightne&s;s in the intention of it: and, at all events, I hope, that the attempt may, at lea&s;t, be con&s;idered as a proof, that I am not afraid of difficulties and labour, nor of the ri&s;k of per&s;onal inconveniences, when I un|dertake any point with a view of &s;erving my country, or mankind in general.</P>

The mi&s;chief done is irreparable, and the outrage is con&s;idered as flowing rather from <HI>brutal rage</HI> or <HI>diabolical malignity, than from human frailty.</HI> And it is to <HI>human frailty,</HI> and to that alone, the Law indulgeth in every ca&s;e of felonious Homicide.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance which he gives by way of illu&s;tration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale, vol. i. p. 473. <Q>If <HI>A.</HI> come into the wood of <HI>B.</HI> and pull his hedges, or cut his wood, and <HI>B.</HI> beat him, whereof he dies, this is <HI>man&s;laughter,</HI> becau&s;e, though it was not lawful for <HI>A.</HI> to cut the wood, it was not lawful for <HI>B.</HI> to beat him, but either to bring him to a Ju&s;tice
<PB N="11" REF="31">of Peace, or puni&s;h him otherwi&s;e according to law.</Q> But here Lord Hale is not &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct in &s;tating the ca&s;e; becau&s;e circum&s;tances are wanting, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the determination of &s;uch a ca&s;e, whether it ought to be e&s;teemed <HI>man&s;laughter</HI> or <HI>murder.</HI> The accurate Judge Fo&s;ter was &s;en&s;ible of this want of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances,</HI> and therefore adds, <Q>But it mu&s;t be under&s;tood (&s;ays he) that he beat him, <HI>not with a mi&s;chievous intention,</HI> but meerly to cha&s;ti&s;e him for the tre&s;pa&s;s, and to deter him from committing the like. For if he had knocked his brains out with <HI>a bill or hedge&s;take,</HI> or had given him <HI>an out|rageous beating</HI> with an ordinary cud|gel beyond the bounds of a <HI>&s;udden re&s;entment,</HI> whereof he had died, <HI>It had been Murder.</HI> For the&s;e circum|&s;tances are &s;ome of the genuine &s;ymp|toms of the <HI>Mala Mens,</HI> the heart
<PB N="12" REF="32">bent upon mi&s;chief, which, as I have already &s;hewn, enter into the true notion <HI>of Malice</HI> in the legal &s;en&s;e of the word.</Q> P. 291.</P>
<P>The next in&s;tance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his hor&s;e's tail. Which was (&s;ays he) <Q><HI>held to be murder.</HI></Q> <Q>For it was a deliberate act, <HI>and &s;avoured of cruelty.</HI></Q> But the third in&s;tance, viz. that of Sted|man the &s;oldier killing a woman <HI>with a &s;word</HI> (which Judge Fo&s;ter mentions as a ca&s;e that <HI>was held clearly to be no more than man&s;laughter</HI>) was, mo&s;t cer|tainly, <HI>wilful murder:</HI> for tho' it appeared that the woman had &s;truck the &s;oldier on the face with an iron patten; yet &s;he afterwards fled from him, and he <Q><HI>pur|&s;uing</HI> her, <HI>&s;tabbed her in the back.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now if &s;uch a ca&s;e of <HI>wilful killing</HI> is to be e&s;teemed only man&s;laughter, it
<PB N="13" REF="33">entirely perverts the ju&s;t arguments already quoted from the &s;ame author concerning the ca&s;es wherein <HI>human frailty</HI> de&s;erves to be <HI>indulged!</HI> May I not u&s;e his own words again&s;t him? That "the&s;e circum&s;tances" (the pur|&s;uing, and &s;tabbing the woman in the back) <Q>are &s;ome of the genuine &s;ymp|toms of the <HI>mala mens,</HI> the <HI>heart bent upon mi&s;chief.</HI></Q> Whereas, if he had <HI>&s;truck her</HI> merely with his fi&s;t, or with a &s;mall &s;tick <HI>not likely</HI> to kill, and had unluckily, and again&s;t his <HI>intention, killed,</HI> it had been but <HI>man&s;laughter.</HI> For this is the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction for which I contend <HI>in all ca&s;es of killing</HI> where the <HI>&s;triking</HI> (not the killing) is <HI>voluntary:</HI> and I cannot &s;o well expre&s;s my meaning as in the words of Judge Fo&s;ter him&s;elf, though that &s;en&s;ible and acute rea&s;oner is afterwards mi&s;led from the truth of his own doctrine, by
<PB N="14" REF="34">paying too much regard (I mean an <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> regard) to the practice of the Courts, which, in this point, has frequently been erroneous.</P>
<P>In page 290, after the 1&s;t &s;ection (already quoted) concerning the cir|cum&s;tances, which <Q>are not a provo|cation &s;ufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder,</Q> he adds, <Q>This rule will, I conceive (&s;ays he) govern every ca&s;e where the Party Killing upon &s;uch provocation <HI>maketh u&s;e of a deadly weapon,</HI> or otherwi&s;e <HI>manife&s;teth an intention to kill,</HI> or to do &s;ome &s;ome great bodily harm. But if he had given the other a box on the ear, or had &s;truck him with a &s;tick or other weapon <HI>not likely to kill,</HI> and <HI>had unluckily and again&s;t his intention</HI> killed, it had been but <HI>man&s;laughter.</HI> The difference between the ca&s;es is plainly this. In the for|mer,
<PB N="15" REF="35"><HI>the malitia, the wicked vindictive di&s;po&s;ition</HI> already mentioned, <HI>evidently appeareth:</HI> in the latter it is <HI>as evidently wanting.</HI> The Party, in the fir&s;t tran&s;|port of his pa&s;&s;ion, intended to cha&s;|ti&s;e for a piece of in&s;olence which few &s;pirits can bear. In this ca&s;e the benignity of the law interpo&s;eth in favour of human frailty; in the other its ju&s;tice regardeth and <HI>puni&s;heth the apparent malignity of the heart.</HI></Q> P. 290 and 291.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the &s;ame author, in p. 296, endeavours to excu&s;e killing in <HI>&s;udden rencounters,</HI> without pre&s;erving this nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction concerning <HI>"the u&s;e of a deadly weapon,"</HI> and <Q><HI>the intention to kill.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>To what I have offered (&s;ays he) with regard to <HI>&s;udden rencounters,</HI> let me add, that the blood, already too
<PB N="16" REF="36">much heated, kindleth afre&s;h at every pa&s;s or blow. And in the tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions, in which <HI>meer in&s;tinct &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> hath no incon&s;ider|able &s;hare, the voice of rea&s;on is not heard.

<PB N="71" REF="91">Man of <HI>true Courage</HI> may retreat <HI>with honour</HI> from the A&s;&s;ault of an Enemy; &s;o that Military Men are liable to be <HI>unju&s;tly</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed, whenever they act <HI>rea|&s;onably</HI> in ca&s;es either of in&s;ult, or a&s;|&s;ault!</P>
<P>Yet, at the &s;ame time, it ought to be remembered, that tho&s;e men who &s;ub|mit to <HI>the Slavi&s;h Yoke</HI> of other Men's depraved opinions or unrea&s;onable cu&s;|toms (in contradiction to that <HI>natural Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Good and Evil,</HI> which they inherit, in common with the re&s;t of Mankind, from our fir&s;t Parents), can|not <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be deemed <HI>Men of Honour;</HI> and, con&s;equently, are unworthy of <HI>Rank</HI> in the honourable Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms. And though &s;uch men may &s;upport an outward <HI>appearance</HI> of <HI>Cour|age</HI> in the eye of the world, by <HI>daring</HI> to violate the Laws of God and Man in <HI>private</HI> Quarrels, yet that very act af|fords
<PB N="72" REF="92">the mo&s;t manife&s;t token of the Want of <HI>real</HI> and <HI>&s;teady Courage:</HI> for unle&s;s the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that depraved cu&s;tom can be attributed to <HI>incon&s;idera|tion, or</HI> to <HI>the want of Knowledge,</HI> it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Duelli&s;t had not &s;ufficient Courage</HI> to a&s;|&s;ert his <HI>natural Right</HI> of Acting agreea|ble to the Dictates of his <HI>own rea&s;on and con&s;cience;</HI> and was <HI>unable to face the Terrors</HI> of <HI>an</HI> adver&s;e Fortune <HI>in a good Cau&s;e;</HI> and therefore, like a wretched <HI>Coward,</HI> he yielded him&s;elf a pri&s;oner and &s;lave to the fa&s;hionable Depravity!</P>
<P>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: &s;ometimes Pa&s;&s;ion and fal&s;e Pride, but more frequently in|con&s;ideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hint|ed) occa&s;ion the ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and conformity to tho&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>unrea&s;ona|ble
<PB N="73" REF="93">notions of Honour,</HI> which almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;o much blame <HI>the Military Gentlemen,</HI> for this unnatural depravity, as I do <HI>the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Law;</HI> who ought to have &s;et them a better exam|ple, and yet, have rather contributed to <HI>the ignorance of the times,</HI> by the many <HI>gro&s;s perver&s;ions</HI> of <HI>our Law,</HI> which they have admitted into the Books. Gen|tlemen of the Army are not obliged, in|deed, to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law, but they mu&s;t not forget that they are <HI>Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Soldiers;</HI> and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of <HI>Men,</HI> (viz. that of thinking for them&s;elves, and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their <HI>own Con&s;cience,</HI> as Members of the Commu|nity), they are unfit for <HI>Briti&s;h Soldiers,</HI> of whom the <HI>Law</HI> requires an acknow|ledgement of <HI>her &s;upremacy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="94">For the Law will not excu&s;e an <HI>un|lawful Act</HI> by a Soldier, even though he commits it by <HI>the expre&s;s Command</HI> of the highe&s;t military Authority in the Kingdom: and much le&s;s is the Sol|dier obliged to conform him&s;elf <HI>impli|citly</HI> to the mere opinions and fal&s;e No|tions of Honour, which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted.&mdash;Even in publick military Service, or warlike Expeditions by <HI>National authority,</HI> the Law manife&s;tly requires the Soldier <HI>to think for him&s;elf;</HI> and to con&s;ider, be|fore he acts in any war, whether the &s;ame be <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> for, if it be otherwi&s;e, the Common Law of this Kingdom will <HI>impute</HI> to him <HI>the Guilt</HI> of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>

<P>Men of <HI>true honour,</HI> therefore, at the &s;ame time that they are &s;en&s;ible of their duty as <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Subjects</HI> to their King, mu&s;t be mindful that they are <HI>&s;ubject al&s;o to the empire of rea&s;on,</HI> and are bound thereby, in common with all mankind, to maintain the <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>natural freedom</HI> of Human Nature: and
