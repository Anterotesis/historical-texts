<HEAD>TO MR. BEARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great plea&s;ure I embrace this opportunity to
acknowledge the favours I have received from you. Among others I would mention
in particular the warmth with which you e&s;pou&s;ed this piece in its
pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tage; but that I am afraid it would be thought a
compliment to your good na|ture, too much at the expence of your
judge|ment.</P>
<P>If this Opera is con&s;idered merely as a piece of Dramatic
writing, it will certainly be found to have very little merit: in that light no
one can think more indifferently of it than I do my&s;elf; but I believe I may
venture to a&s;&s;ert, on your opinion, that &s;ome of the &s;ongs are
tollerable; that the mu&s;ic is more plea&s;ing than has hitherto appeared in
any compo&s;ition of this kind; and the words better adapted, con&s;idering the
na|ture of the airs, which are not common bal|lads, than could be expected,
&s;uppo&s;ing any degree of poetry to be pre&s;erved in the ver|&s;ification.
More than this few people expect, in an Opera, and if &s;ome of the &s;everer
cri|tics &s;hould be inclined to blame your indul|gence to one of the fir&s;t
attempts of a young writer, I am per&s;uaded the Public in ge|neral <PB REF="3"> will applaud your endeavour to pro|vide them with &s;omething new, in
a &s;pecies of entertainment, in which the performers at your Theatre &s;o
eminently excel.</P>
<P>You may perceive Sir, that I yield a punc|tual ob&s;ervance to the
injunctions you laid upon me, when I threatened you with this addre&s;s, and
make it rather a preface than a dedication: And yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I can
hardly reconcile tho&s;e formalities which ren|der it indelicate to pay
prai&s;es where all the world allows them to be due; nor can I ea&s;ily
conceive why a man &s;hould be &s;o &s;tudious to de&s;erve, what he does not
de&s;ire: But &s;ince you will not allow me to offer any panegy|ric to you, I
mu&s;t ha&s;ten to be&s;tow one upon my&s;elf, and let the public know (which
was my chief de&s;ign in this intro|duction) that I have the honor to be,</P>

<P>It is the only character, my dear, in which I could hope to lie
