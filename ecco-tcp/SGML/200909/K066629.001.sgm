<P>THE following Lectures upon the Catechi&s;m of the Church of England, have little pretence to expect attention from the genera|lity of readers, who are furni&s;hed with many better helps. But as they were compo&s;ed for your u&s;e; and as &s;everal of you, at different times, have de&s;ired copies of them; they may, aided by your partiality, perhaps meet with a more favou|rable
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
reception among you. They acco&s;t you with the familiarity of an old acquaintance; and hope to get admittance, and whi&s;per a few &s;erious truths, when wi&s;er in&s;truc|tors are neglected.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, in &s;ome de|gree, to give them a better form, than that plain one, in which you knew them. I have abridged them al&s;o, as I would not tre&s;pa&s;s too much upon your hours of lei&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;hould be &s;orry to fatigue your patience as a friend, though I have been &s;ometimes, per|haps, obliged to do it as a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the evidences of our religion, and the great doctrines of Chri&s;ti|anity,
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
it hath been my chief en|deavour to engage your attention. If the mind be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e leading truths, it re|quires only a &s;lighter le&s;&s;on on mo|rals. Faith, we know, was the great point in preaching the go&s;|pel; and he who &s;eriou&s;ly believes it, cannot well fail of being a good Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e Lectures, to &s;hew you, that &s;carce any of the great truths of the go&s;pel were &s;o wholly new, but that &s;ome notices of them, or at lea&s;t re&s;emblances, maybe traced even among the heathen nations&mdash; among tho&s;e, which were more poli&s;hed e&s;pecially; and perhaps
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
among all, if we were more inti|mately acquainted with them: and as this &s;hews either a great har|mony between rea&s;on and revela|tion; or, that the&s;e preparatory notices originated immediately from the Deity; it always appeared to me an argument, that carried great conviction. If we even &s;up|po&s;e, the&s;e notices to have been wholly of Jewi&s;h origin, &s;till the unforced adoption of them, &s;hews &s;trongly their agreement with rea|&s;on; and therefore oppo&s;es &s;trong|ly the endeavours of tho&s;e, who labour to &s;et rea&s;on and revelation at variance.</P>
<P>In this light, a late very ingeni|ous, and di&s;tingui&s;hed writer, &s;eems
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
to build a part of his theory upon fal&s;e ground; when he tells us, that from the New Te&s;tament <HI>may be extracted a &s;y&s;tem of religion, en|tirely new, both with regard to the object, and the doctrines of it; and totally unlike every thing, which had ever before entered into the mind of man.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jenyns's Inter. Evid. p. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>In pre&s;&s;ing moral rules, I have &s;ometimes rather cho&s;en a quota|tion from Horace, than a text from &s;cripture. In one &s;en&s;e, he is better authority than an apo&s;tle. If his uninlightened mind had &s;uch ju&s;t and noble &s;entiments, what may be expected from a Chri&s;tian?</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8">It was &s;ome inducement to me, Gentlemen, in publi&s;hing there papers, to leave in your memory a te&s;timony of that earne&s;tne&s;s, with which I always wi&s;hed to pre&s;s upon you the great truths of religion, and virtue. The&s;e, with|out any di&s;paragement to human li|terature, ought certainly to be the fir&s;t objects of education. Where one mi&s;carries for want of learn|ing, numbers mi&s;carry for want of principles.</P>
<P>I have, with great &s;atisfaction, &s;een many of you, as you came forward in life, filling your &s;everal &s;tations, with propriety and cre|dit: and it is one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of my retirement, to

think, I &s;hall daily &s;ee many more. A few mortifications too I have had. But there is &s;ome ground, at lea&s;t, to hope, that where good principles have been early incul|cated, they may, &s;ooner or later, revive: and &s;hould the&s;e lectures contribute, in any degree, to that purpo&s;e, they will have an&s;wered one of my principal ends.</P>
<P>That the&s;e, or any other means, may enable you to &s;ee your real, and mo&s;t important intere&s;ts in life, and to pur&s;ue them &s;teadily, is, with great affection, and ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, the con&s;tant wi&s;h of</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Hi&s;tory of the catechi&s;m&mdash;general contents of it&mdash;bapti&s;mal vow&mdash; u&s;e of &s;pon&s;ors&mdash;name given in bapti&s;m&mdash;&s;ub&s;tance of the vow&mdash;re|nunciation of &s;in&mdash;faith&mdash;obedience &mdash;connection between them&mdash;St. Paul's Doctrine with regard to faith, explained&mdash;promi&s;es made, on God's part, upon our keeping the vow&mdash; divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11">IT was among the earlie&s;t cares of the fir&s;t promoters of the reforma|tion, to provide a catechi&s;m for the in|&s;truction of youth. But the &s;ame cau|tion, with regard to the prejudices of men, was nece&s;&s;arily to be u&s;ed in this matter, as had been u&s;ed in all the other religious tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times. At fir&s;t, it was thought &s;ufficient to begin with &s;uch common things, as were ac|knowledged both by papi&s;ts and pro|te&s;tants. The fir&s;t catechi&s;m therefore con&s;i&s;ted &s;imply of the creed, the ten commandments, and the Lord's prayer: and it was no ea&s;y matter to bring even the&s;e into general u&s;e. They were re|ceived by the people, in the mid&s;t of that profound ignorance, which then reigned, as a &s;pecies of incanta|tion; and it was long before the gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="12">
of vulgar conception was even en|lightened enough to apprehend, that the creed, the ten commandments, and the Lord's prayer, meant &s;imply to di|rect their faith, their practice, and their devotion.</P>
<P>This was all the progre&s;s, that was made in catechetical in&s;truction from the beginning of the reformation, till &s;o late a period as the year 1549. About that time a farther attempt was made by archbi&s;hop Cranmer, as it is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed. He ventured to add a few cautious explanatory pa&s;&s;ages; which was all the prejudices of men would yet bear. The great prudence indeed, of that wi&s;e and good man, appeared in nothing more, than in the ea&s;y movements, with which he in|troduced every change.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13">In the year 1553, a farther attempt was hazarded. A catechi&s;m was publi&s;h|ed by authority, in which not only the creed, the ten commandments, and the Lord's prayer were more fully expound|ed; but a brief explanation al&s;o of the &s;acraments was added. This bold work, however, was not ventured in the engli&s;h tongue; but was publi&s;hed in latin, for the u&s;e of &s;chools. Arch|bi&s;hop Wake,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the dedication to his commentary on the church catechi&s;m.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e authority I chief|ly follow, &s;uppo&s;es this catechi&s;m to be the fir&s;t model of that, which is now in u&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the matter re&s;ted, till the reign of Elizabeth. In the mean time, the violent mea&s;ures of her predece&s;&s;or, had tended greatly to open an inqui&s;itive temper in the age; and to aboli&s;h its
<PB N="6" REF="14">
prejudices. Men began to have &s;ome notion of thinking for them&s;elves; and it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that extreme caution, which had hi|therto been ob&s;erved, in addre&s;&s;ing them on religious &s;ubjects. The catechi&s;m therefore was now improved on a more liberal plan; and having undergone &s;e|veral reviews, was at length publi&s;hed by authority, nearly in its pre&s;ent form, in the year 1563. It ought to be men|tioned, that the per&s;on principally con|cerned in this work, was Nowel, dean of St. Paul's.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort hi&s;tory of the cate|chi&s;m, the various forms it underwent, and the care and caution employed in compo&s;ing it, we need not wonder at finding it, what it really appears to be, a very accurate, judicious, and compre|hen&s;ive
<PB N="7" REF="15">
&s;ummary of the principles, and doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>It begins with a recital of our bap|ti&s;mal vow, as a kind of preface to the whole. It then lays down the great chri&s;tian principle of faith; and leaving all my&s;terious inquiries, in which this &s;ubject is involved, it pa&s;&s;es on to the rules of practice. Having briefly re|cited the&s;e, it concludes with a &s;imple, and very intelligible explanation of bap|ti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>The catechi&s;m then begins very pro|perly, with a recital of our bapti&s;mal vow, as the be&s;t preface to that belief, and tho&s;e rules of practice, in which that vow engaged us.&mdash;But before we examine the vow it&s;elf, two appendages of it require explanation&mdash;the u&s;e of &s;pon&s;ors&mdash;and the addition of a name.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">With regard to the &s;pon&s;or, the church probably imitates the appoint|ment of the legal guardian, making the be&s;t provi&s;ion it can, for the pious edu|cation of orphans, and de&s;erted chil|dren. The temporal and the &s;piritual guardian may equally betray their tru&s;t: both are culpable: both accountable: but &s;urely the latter breaks the more &s;acred engagement.</P>
<P>As to promi&s;ing and vowing in the name of another, (which &s;eems to carry &s;o har&s;h a &s;ound) the &s;pon&s;or only en|gages for the child, as any one would en|gage for another, in a matter, which is manife&s;tly for his advantage: and on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the child hereafter will &s;ee it to be &s;o&mdash;that is, he promi&s;es, as he takes it for granted, the child it|&s;elf would have promi&s;ed, if it had been able.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17">With regard to the name, it is no part of the &s;acrament; nor pretends to &s;criptural authority. It re&s;ts merely on ancient u&s;age. A cu&s;tom had ge|nerally obtained, of giving a new name, upon adopting a new member into a fa|mily. We find it common among the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews: nay, we read that even God him&s;elf, when he received Abraham into covenant, giving an early &s;anction to this u&s;age, changed his name to Abraham. In imitation of this common practice, the old chri&s;tians gave bapti&s;mal names to their children, which were intended to point out their heavenly adoption, as their &s;urnames di&s;tingui&s;hed their temporal alliance.</P>
<P>From con&s;idering the u&s;e of &s;pon&s;ors, and of the name, in bapti&s;m, we pro|ceed next to the vow it&s;elf, which is thus
<PB N="10" REF="18">
expre&s;&s;ed. <Q>My godfathers did pro|mi&s;e three things in my name: 1&s;t, That I &s;hould renounce the devil, and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h. 2dly, That I &s;hould believe all the articles of the chri&s;tian faith; and 3dly, That I &s;hould keep God's holy will, and commandments, and walk in the &s;ame all the days of my life.</Q></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, we promi&s;e to <Q>renounce the devil, and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h.</Q> <Q>The devil, the world, and the fle&s;h,</Q> is a comprehen&s;ive mode of ex|pre&s;&s;ing every &s;pecies of &s;in, however di&s;tingui&s;hed; and from whatever &s;ource derived: all which we not only en|gage
<PB N="11" REF="19">
to renounce as far as we are able; but al&s;o to take pains in tracing the la|byrinths of our own hearts; and in re|moving the glo&s;&s;es of &s;elf-deceit. With|out this, all renunciation of &s;in is pre|tence.</P>
<P>Being thus injoined to renounce our gro&s;s, habitual &s;ins, and tho&s;e bad in|clinations, which lead us into them; we are required next to <Q>believe all the articles of the chri&s;tian faith.</Q> This is a natural progre&s;&s;ion. When we are thoroughly convinced of the malignity of &s;in, we in cour&s;e wi&s;h to avoid the ill con&s;equences of it; and are prepared to give a fair hearing to the evidence of religion. There is a clo&s;e connection between vice, and infidelity. They mu|tually &s;upport each other. The &s;ame connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a well di&s;|po&s;ed mind, and the truths of religion:
<PB N="12" REF="20">
and faith perhaps is not &s;o involuntary an act, as many of our modern philo&s;o|phers would per&s;uade us.</P>
<P>After <Q>believing the articles of the chri&s;tian faith,</Q> we are la&s;tly injoined to <Q>keep God's holy will and com|mandments.</Q> Here too is the &s;ame natural progre&s;&s;ion. As the renuncia|tion of &s;in prepares the way for faith, &s;o does faith lead directly to obedi|ence. They &s;eem related to each other, as the mean and the end. "The end of the commandment," &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <Q>is charity, out of a pure heart, and good con&s;cience, and faith unfeigned.</Q> Faith, (which is the act of believing upon rational evidence,) is the great fountain, from which all chri&s;tian vir|tues &s;pring. No man will obey a law, till he hath informed him&s;elf whether it be properly authorized: or, in other
<PB N="13" REF="21">
words, till he believe in the juri&s;diction that enacted it.&mdash;If our faith in Chri&s;t doth not lead us to obey him; it is what the &s;criptures call a dead faith, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;aving one.</P>
<P>To this in&s;eparable connection be|tween faith and obedience, St. Paul's doctrine may be objected, where he &s;eems to lay the whole &s;tre&s;s on faith, in oppo&s;ition to works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Rom.</HI> iii. 28. <HI>and indeed great part of the epi&s;tle.</HI></NOTE>.&mdash;But it is plain, that St Paul's argument requires him to mean by faith, the whole &s;y&s;tem of the chri&s;tian religion, (which is indeed the meaning of the word in many other parts of &s;cripture;) and by works, which he &s;ets in oppo&s;ition to it, the moral law. So that, in fact, the apo|&s;tle's argument relates not to the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion; but tends only to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;uperiority of chri&s;tianity. The
<PB N="14" REF="22">
moral law, argues the apo&s;tle, which claimed on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of works, makes no provi&s;ion for the deficiences of man. Chri&s;tianity alone, by open|ing a door of mercy, gave him hopes of that &s;alvation, which the other could not pretend to give.</P>
<P>Upon renouncing &s;in, believing the articles of the chri&s;tian faith, and keep|ing God's holy commandments, as far as &s;inful man can keep them, we are intitled by promi&s;e to all the privileges of the go&s;pel. We <Q>become members of Chri&s;t, children of God, and in|heritors of the kingdom of heaven.</Q> We are redeemed through the merits of Chri&s;t; pardoned through the mercies of God; and rewarded with a ble&s;&s;ed immortality.</P>
<P>This account of our bapti&s;mal vow concludes with a que&s;tion, leading us to
<PB N="15" REF="23">
acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving this vow; and to declare our belief, that our only hope of keeping it re&s;ts upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered our bapti&s;mal vow, or the prefatorial part, we come now to the body it&s;elf of the catechi&s;m; which naturally divides into the two great bran|ches of the vow, faith, and obedience&mdash; the fir&s;t as contained in the creed; the &s;econd in the commandments.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Hi&s;tory of creeds&mdash;three creeds e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in our church&mdash;the apo&s;tles creed &mdash;analy&s;is of it&mdash;authenticity of &s;crip|ture proved&mdash;from a chain of the earlie&s;t writers, mentioning, and quot|ing them&mdash;from the enemies of chri&s;|tianity acknowledging their exi&s;tence &mdash; from the rejection of forged go&s;|pels and epi&s;tles&mdash;from their various tran&s;lations&mdash;from reading them in public a&s;&s;emblies&mdash;from their internal evidence&mdash;argument again&s;t their a|dulteration, from the jealou&s;ies of different &s;ects&mdash;objections an&s;wered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25">WHEN the purity of the chri&s;tian religion became mingled with human inventions; and &s;ectaries, in&s;tead of judging from the whole tenor of the go&s;pel, built their narrow &s;y&s;tems upon detached parts&mdash;then it was that diffe|rent churches thought it nece&s;&s;ary to frame creeds, with an intention to di&s;|tingui&s;h articles of faith from matters of opinion: and the primary idea of a creed was merely to bring the&s;e articles together, from various parts of &s;crip|ture, into one point of view.</P>
<P>But as corruption advanced, and dif|ferent churches began to found different &s;y&s;tems on the &s;ame articles; then each church thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed a &s;tep further; and to inlarge its creed by explanations; with a view to &s;hew, in what &s;en&s;e it received each article;
<PB N="20" REF="26">
or, in other words, to draw a line be|tween it&s;elf, and &s;uch churches, as it thought held un&s;criptural tenets.&mdash; Hence, we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that many of the&s;e creeds were as ab&s;urd, as the various opinions, which gave them birth: and hence the creeds, even of the pure&s;t churches, became clogged with explanatory clau&s;es; which if they had their u&s;e in &s;ome ca&s;es, produced mi&s;chief in others.&mdash;This is the &s;hort hi&s;tory of creeds.</P>
<P>In our church, three of the&s;e ancient creeds are retained&mdash;that authenticated by the council of Nice&mdash;the Athena&s;ian &mdash;and that which is commonly, tho improperly, called the Apo&s;tles-creed. As to the Athena&s;ian creed, it has given great offence to many well-meaning per|&s;ons, by the damnatory clau&s;es with which it is guarded; though, in fact,
<PB N="21" REF="27">
the&s;e make no part of the creed it&s;elf; but re&s;t &s;olely with the author of it. The apo&s;tles creed, however, is charge|able with nothing of this kind: it hath &s;tood the te&s;t of ages; and (unle&s;s in one or two ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages) hath been ever thought unexceptionable.</P>
<P>This creed was compo&s;ed before any of the &s;ubtilties of the doctrine of the tri|nity were introduced; which tend more to create animo&s;ity among&s;t men, than to amend their hearts. In it we &s;imply declare our belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy-gho&s;t&mdash;in the &s;cripture ac|count of the life, and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t&mdash;in the redemption of the world from &s;in&mdash;in the re&s;urrection of the dead &mdash;and in the eternity of a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>But before we enter upon the exami|nation of the&s;e points, as we &s;hall have
<PB N="22" REF="28">
frequent occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of it, to appeal to the New Te&s;tament, it &s;eems natural, fir&s;t to prove the au|thenticity of the &s;everal books of which it is compo&s;ed. I &s;hall ju&s;t therefore touch the heads of argument, made u&s;e of in this proof.</P>
<P>A &s;eries of chri&s;tian writers, Irenaeus, Ju&s;tin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement, Origen, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The reader will find the&s;e proofs at large, in Whit|by's general introduction to the go&s;pels and epi&s;tles; and in Jenkins's rea&s;onab. of chri&s;tianity, vol. <HI>ii.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI> He will find likewi&s;e proofs in favour of St. Mat|thew's go&s;pel, the epi&s;tles to the Hebrews, and &s;ome other parts of &s;cripture, which were not at fir&s;t &s;o univer&s;ally received.</HI></P></NOTE> and others, who lived in the ages &s;ucceeding tho&s;e of the apo&s;tles, and who&s;e writings are &s;till extant, agree in declaring tho&s;e books, which compo&s;e the canon of &s;cripture, as now &s;ettled,
<PB N="23" REF="29">
to have de&s;cended regularly from the apo&s;tolic times.</P>
<P>The very originals indeed of &s;ome of them appear to have been pre&s;erved, till the third century; for Tertullian, who dyed at the clo&s;e of the &s;econd, &s;eems to appeal to them, as then exi&s;t|ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Percurre eccle&s;ias apo&s;tolicas, apud quas ip&s;ae au|thenticae literae eorum recitantur, &s;onantes vocem, &amp; reprae&s;entantes faciem uniu&s;cuju&s;q.</HI></P>
<BIBL><HI>De Prae&s;crip. c. <HI>36.</HI></HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e early ages the authenticity of &s;cripture was univer&s;ally acknowledged, both by friends and enemies. Cel&s;us, Julian, and all the eminent anti-chri|&s;tians of tho&s;e days, no more di&s;puted the authenticity of &s;cripture, than we do that of the koran. Their objections to the one, and our objections to the
<PB N="24" REF="30">
other, run in a different channel. On this head no di&s;putes were ever heard of; nor any interruption in the regular chain of evidence.</P>
<P>When indeed could a forgery have been introduced? In whatever age we &s;uppo&s;e it to have been attempted, we cannot imagine the chri&s;tians of that age would have been &s;upine in examining a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence: and as the &s;criptures &s;till hold their credit, we may fairly conclude, that either no &s;uch attempt was ever made; or that, if it was made, it was wholly inefficacious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, many go&s;pels and epi&s;tles appeared in different ages of the church; and tho &s;ome of them had a very evan|gelical ca&s;t, and were writings of intrin|&s;ic value, yet they were rejected by all
<PB N="25" REF="31">
chri&s;tians, only becau&s;e they could not produce proofs of their authenticity.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e common marks of authenticity, the &s;cripture hath others peculiar to it&s;elf. It was tran&s;lated into all languages: it was every where di&s;per&s;ed: it was carefully pre|&s;erved in churches, and other public places: it was read not only in private; but univer&s;ally in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people: its friends had the highe&s;t ve|neration for it, as it contained the char|ter of all their hopes; and its enemies held it in the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion, as it combated all their worldly &s;chemes, and preten&s;ions. Nay to &s;uch a degree of rancour were its adver&s;aries animated, that they often endeavoured to de&s;troy it utterly; which it is not probable they would have attempted, if they could have &s;hewn it to have been &s;pu|rious:
<PB N="26" REF="32">
this would certainly have been a more liberal, as well as a more effectual mode of rejection.</P>
<P>To the external evidence, in proof of the authenticity of &s;cripture, may be added no little degree of &s;trength from its internal evidence. The &s;implicity of the writers, and of the writings cor|re&s;pond. There is the &s;ame agreement between the &s;everal parts of each book, and the general &s;cheme of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>An appeal al&s;o is often made to ex|traordinary gifts, which, in tho&s;e early times, were exerci&s;ed in the church: and &s;urely no impo&s;tor would have been forward in making &s;uch an appeal, if no &s;uch gifts had been known.</P>
<P>Different per&s;ons likewi&s;e, who were then alive, are mentioned; which afford|ed
<PB N="27" REF="33">
a very unnece&s;&s;ary hint for a detec|tion, if no &s;uch per&s;ons had exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>In many of St. Paul's epi&s;tles al&s;o a variety of rites, and cu&s;toms are al|luded to, as then in u&s;e, which in the next age, after the de&s;truction of Jeru|&s;alem, are known to have been totally aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But tho the &s;cripture could not be forged, might it not have been adulte|rated?</P>
<P>This &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible from the va|riety of &s;ects, which &s;prang up in the earlie&s;t times of chri&s;tianity. As the&s;e, in general, per&s;ecuted each other, they would undoubtedly have joined in cla|mour again&s;t any one &s;ect, which had ventured to receive a portion of &s;crip|ture
<PB N="28" REF="34">
as genuine, which was not univer|&s;ally acknowledged.</P>
<P>Objections, though of no great force, have been made to &s;cripture, from the di&s;agreement found among the ancient copies of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>But this di&s;agreement con&s;i&s;ts, in ge|neral, of mere grammatical niceties. In one copy, a particle is added, which is omitted in another. Of this &s;ort are the greater part of the various readings of the New Te&s;tament: and it could not well be otherwi&s;e. Inaccu|racies of this kind are unavoidable; and may indeed argue inattention in the tran&s;criber; but are &s;urely no argument again&s;t the authenticity of the book.</P>
<P>The objector argues with more weight, when he alledges, what he calls,
<PB N="29" REF="35">
the contradictions of &s;cripture. One of the &s;acred writers tells us, that our Saviour ordered his di&s;ciples, when they preached, to take &s;taves: another, that he ordered them to take none. This affirms, that at the re&s;urrection two angels were &s;een; that mentions on|ly one. And he who will be at the pains of comparing attentively all the evangelical accounts, mu&s;t be obliged to acknowledge, they are far from being perfectly harmonious.&mdash;Now, where we find &s;uch manife&s;t contradictions, what are we to &s;ay? Is there any dependence upon books, in which they are found?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this objection, it might perhaps be no difficult matter to &s;hew, that the&s;e contradictions do not really exi&s;t; and that the pa&s;&s;ages, which are imagined to contain them, may be re|conciled. But giving the objection its
<PB N="30" REF="36">
force, it has no tendency to overthrow the veracity of the &s;acred writings: it rather indeed concludes in favour of them; ina&s;much as it &s;hews, there was no collu&s;ion among the writers. Such little variations affect neither the doc|trine, nor the hi&s;tory. The doctrine is clearly con&s;i&s;tent throughout; and the hi&s;tory is evidently, in all its material circum&s;tances, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But where is your in&s;piration then? If the &s;pirit of God directs, it will direct even the minute&s;t truth.</P>
<P>If it only pre&s;erve from error in mat|ters of importance, it is &s;urely &s;ufficient. To &s;uppo&s;e more, would be to conceive very gro&s;ly of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h the authenticity of &s;cripture, we might

re&s;t the proof of the &s;everal articles of our creed on its &s;ole authority. But as it is one of the various pleas of &s;cepti|ci&s;m to &s;et rea&s;on and &s;cripture at vari|ance, it will perhaps be more &s;atisfac|tory to carry our rea&s;on along with us in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e proofs; and re&s;t them, as we may do in all ca&s;es, except where our rea&s;on is incapable, on rational evidence, as well as on &s;criptu|ral authority. Both rea&s;on, and &s;crip|ture have their origin from the &s;ame great being; and therefore there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t, &s;o much harmony between them, as that one can never contradict the other.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being of a God proved&mdash;from the cre|ation of the world, implying de&s;ign in the whole, and all its parts&mdash;from the uniformity ob&s;erved in the pre|&s;ervation of it&mdash;from the univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind, whether we &s;up|po&s;e it founded on tradition; or con|&s;ider it as the re&s;ult of men's own rea|&s;oning&mdash;athei&s;tical objections from individuals profe&s;&s;ing athei&s;m&mdash;from the apparent inju&s;tice of God's go|vernment&mdash;the&s;e objections an&s;wered &mdash;for ju&s;t notions of the deity, re|cour&s;e mu&s;t be had to &s;cripture.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="35" REF="39">THE creed begins with a profe&s;&s;ion of our belief in "God the Fa|ther almighty, maker of heaven and earth."</P>
<P>The being of a God is one of tho&s;e truths, which &s;carce require proof. A proof &s;eems rather an injury, as it &s;up|po&s;es doubt. However, as young minds, though not &s;ceptical, are unin|formed, it may not be improper to &s;e|lect out of the variety of arguments, which evince this great truth, two or three of the mo&s;t &s;imple.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a deity, we prove from the light of nature. For his at|tributes, at lea&s;t in any perfection, we mu&s;t look into &s;cripture.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="40">A few plain and &s;imple arguments drawn from the creation of the world&mdash; the pre&s;ervation of it&mdash;and the general con&s;ent of mankind, &s;trike us with more conviction, than all the &s;ubtil|ties of metaphy&s;ical deduction.</P>
<P>We prove the being of a God fir&s;t from the creation of the world.</P>
<P>The world mu&s;t have been produced either by de&s;ign, or by chance. No other mode of origin can be &s;uppo&s;ed. Let us &s;ee then with which of the&s;e cha|racters it is impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic of the works of de&s;ign, is a relation of parts, in order to produce an end.&mdash;The characteri&s;tic of the works of chance is ju&s;t the rever&s;e.&mdash; When we &s;ee &s;tones, an&s;wering each other, laid in the form of a regular building, we
<PB N="37" REF="41">
immediately &s;ay, they were put together by de&s;ign: but when we &s;ee them thrown about in a di&s;orderly heap, we &s;ay as confidently, they have been thrown &s;o by chance.</P>
<P>Now, in the world, and all its ap|pendages, there is plainly this appear|ance of de&s;ign. One part relates to ano|ther; and the whole together produces an end. The &s;un, for in&s;tance, is con|nected with the earth, by warming it into a proper heat, for the production of its fruits; and furni&s;hing it with rain and dew. The earth again is connec|ted with all the vegetables, which it produces, by providing them with pro|per &s;oils, and juices for their nouri&s;h|ment. The&s;e again are connected with animals, by &s;upplying them with food. And the whole together produces the
<PB N="38" REF="42">
great end of &s;u&s;taining the lives of in|numerable creatures.</P>
<P>Nor is de&s;ign &s;hewn only in the grand fabric of the world, and all its relative appendages; it is equally &s;hewn in every part. It is &s;een in every animal, adap|ted in all its peculiarities to its proper mode of life. It is &s;een in every vege|table, furni&s;hed with parts exactly &s;uited to its &s;ituation. In the lea&s;t, as well as in the greate&s;t of nature's productions, it is every where apparent. The little creeper upon the wall, extending its te|nacious fibres, draws nouri&s;hment from the crannies of the &s;tones; and flouri&s;hes where no other plant could live.</P>
<P>If then the world, and every part of it, are thus marked with the characters of de&s;ign, there can be no difficulty in acknowledging the author of &s;uch de&s;ign
<PB N="39" REF="43">
&mdash;of &s;uch amazing contrivance, and variety, to be a being of infinite wi&s;dom and power. We call a man ingenious, who makes even a common globe, with all the parts of the earth delineated up|on it. What &s;hall we &s;ay then of the author of the great original it&s;elf, in all its grandeur, and furni&s;hed with all its various inhabitants?</P>
<P>The argument drawn from the pre|&s;ervation of the world, is indeed rather the la&s;t argument advanced a &s;tep far|ther.</P>
<P>If chance could be &s;uppo&s;ed to pro|duce a regular form, yet it is certainly beyond the highe&s;t degree of credulity, to &s;uppo&s;e, it could continue this regu|larity for any time. But we find it has been continued: we find, that near 6000 years have made no change in the
<PB N="40" REF="44">
order and harmony of the world. The &s;un's action upon the earth hath ever been regular. The production of trees, plants, and herbs, hath ever been uni|form. Every &s;eed produces now the &s;ame fruit it ever did. Every &s;pecies of animal life is &s;till the &s;ame. Could chance continue this regular arrange|ment? Could any thing continue it but the hand of an omnipotent God?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we &s;ee this great truth, the be|ing of a God, witne&s;&s;ed by the general con&s;ent of mankind. This general con&s;ent mu&s;t ari&s;e either from tradition, or it mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of men's own rea|&s;oning. Upon either &s;uppo&s;ition, it is an argument equally &s;trong. If the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition be allowed, it will be diffi|cult to a&s;&s;ign any &s;ource of this tradi|tion, but God him&s;elf. If the &s;econd, it can &s;carce be &s;uppo&s;ed, that all
<PB N="41" REF="45">
mankind, in different parts of the world, &s;hould agree in the belief of a thing, which never exi&s;ted. For tho doubts have ari&s;en concerning this ge|neral belief; yet it is now pretty well a&s;certained, from the accounts of tra|vellers, that no nation hath yet been di&s;covered, among whom &s;ome traces of religious wor&s;hip have not been found.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o, &s;ays the objector; yet &s;till we find &s;ingle per&s;ons, even in civilized countries, and &s;ome of them men of enlarged capacities, who have not only had their doubts on this &s;ubject; but have proclaimed aloud their di&s;belief of a divine being?</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, that it is more than pro|bable, no man's infidelity on this head was ever thoroughly &s;ettled. Bad men,
<PB N="42" REF="46">
rather endeavour to convince them|&s;elves, than are really convinced.&mdash;But even on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that a few &s;uch per&s;ons could be found,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>One of the mo&s;t remarkable anecdotes of athei&s;m is related of a per&s;on at Rome, who, it is &s;aid, was condemned for his infidelity; but had his life repeatedly offered, if he would acknowledge a deity. He re|fu&s;ed, and &s;uffered death with con&s;tancy. Man|deville, and Voltaire both glory in this hero, as de&s;troying the whole te&s;timony of martyrs. If the fact be true, (tho' I know not on what evidence it re&s;ts) one would &s;u&s;pect his under&s;tanding was injured; as the whole hi&s;tory of mankind perhaps affords not another &s;uch in&s;tance.</HI></P></NOTE> what is their te&s;timony again&s;t &s;o great a majority, as the re&s;t of mankind? The light of the &s;un is univer&s;ally acknowledged, though it happens, that now and then, a man may be born blind.</P>
<P>But &s;ince, it &s;eems, there are diffi|culties in &s;uppo&s;ing a divine creator and pre&s;erver of the world, what &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="43" REF="47">
of things does the athei&s;t &s;uppo&s;e at|tended with fewer? He &s;ees the world produced before him. He &s;ees it hath been created; and is pre&s;erved. Some account of this matter mu&s;t be given. If ours di&s;plea&s;e him; let us have his.</P>
<P>The experiment hath been tried. We have had many athei&s;tical creeds; none of which hath &s;tood the te&s;t of be|ing handed down with any degree of credit into future times.</P>
<P>The athei&s;t's great argument indeed again&s;t a deity, is levelled at the ap|parent inju&s;tice of his government. It was an objection of ancient date; and might have had its weight in heathen times: but it is one of the ble&s;&s;ings, which attends chri&s;tianity, that it &s;atisfies all our doubts on this head; and gives us a rational, and ea&s;y &s;olution of this
<PB N="44" REF="48">
poignant objection. What if we ob|&s;erve an inaccurate di&s;tribution of the things of this world? What if virtue be depre&s;&s;ed, and vice triumphant? It is nothing, &s;ays the voice of religion, to him, who believes this life to be an in|con&s;iderable part of his being; a point only in the expan&s;e of eternity: who believes he is &s;ent into this world, mere|ly to prepare him&s;elf for a better. This world, he knows, is intended neither for reward, nor puni&s;hment. Happine&s;s unque&s;tionably attends virtue even here; and mi&s;ery, vice: but it is not the hap|pine&s;s of a &s;plendid &s;tation; but of a peaceful mind: nor is it the mi&s;ery of low circum&s;tances, but of a guilty con|&s;cience. The things of this world are not, in their own nature, connected either with happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Attended &s;ometimes by one, and &s;ometimes by the other, they are merely the means of
<PB N="45" REF="49">
trial. One man is tempted with riches, and another with poverty; but God intends neither an elevated, nor a de|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation as the ultimate com|pletion of his will.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if worldly pro&s;perity even was the indication of God's favour, yet good men may have failings, and im|prudencies enough about them to de|&s;erve misfortune; and bad men virtues, which may de&s;erve &s;ucce&s;s. Why &s;hould imprudence, tho joined with virtue, partake of its reward? Or the generous purpo&s;e &s;hare in the puni&s;hment, tho connected with vice?</P>
<P>Thus then we &s;ee the being of a God is the univer&s;al creed of nature. But tho nature could inve&s;tigate the &s;imple truth, &s;he could not pre&s;erve it from error. Nature merely takes her notions
<PB N="46" REF="50">
from what &s;he &s;ees, and what &s;he hears; and hath ever moulded her gods in the likene&s;s of things in heaven, and things on earth. Hence every part of the cre|ation, animate, and inanimate, hath, by turns, been an object of wor&s;hip. And even the mo&s;t refined nations, we know, had gro&s;s conceptions on this head. The wi&s;e&s;t of them indeed, by ob&s;erv|ing the wonders of creation, could cloath the Deity with wi&s;dom and power: but they could go no farther. The virtues of their heroes afforded them the highe&s;t ideas of perfection: and with the&s;e they arrayed their gods; mixing al&s;o with their virtues, &s;uch vices, as are found in the characters of the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>For ju&s;t notions of the Deity, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e then to revelation alone. Revelation removes all the&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="51">
ab&s;urdities. It di&s;pels the clouds of ignorance; and unveils the divine ma|je&s;ty, as far as it can be the object of human contemplation. The lax notions of libertini&s;m, on one hand, which make the deity an inob&s;ervant governor; and the glooming ideas of &s;uper&s;tition, on the other, which &s;uppo&s;e him to be a dark, malignant being, are equally ex|po&s;ed. Here we are informed of the omni&s;cience, and omnipre&s;ence of God. Here we learn, that his wi&s;dom and power are equalled by his goodne&s;s; and that his mercy is over all his works. In &s;hort, we learn from revelation, that we are in the hands of a being, who&s;e knowledge we cannot evade, and who&s;e power we cannot re&s;i&s;t; who is merciful and good to all his creatures; and will be ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and re|ward tho&s;e, who endeavour to conform
<PB N="48" REF="52">
them&s;elves to his will: but who&s;e ju&s;tice, at the &s;ame time, accompanying his mercy, will puni&s;h the bold, and carele&s;s &s;inner in proportion to his guilt.</P>

<P>Pliny's <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 10.</NOTE> te&s;timony is more large. It is contained in a letter, written to the emperor Trajan, de&s;iring his in&s;truc|tions with regard to chri&s;tians. He blames their ob&s;tinacy in refu&s;ing to &s;acrifice to the Roman deities&mdash;but from their own confe&s;&s;ion can draw nothing, but that they a&s;&s;emble, on a certain day, before &s;un ri&s;e,&mdash;that they pay divine honours to Chri&s;t as a God,&mdash;that they

bind them&s;elves by a &s;acrament not to &s;teal, nor to commit adultery, nor to de|ceive&mdash;and that, after the perfor|mance of the&s;e rites, they join in one common meal. Nay he examined, he &s;ays, two of them by torture: yet &s;till he finds nothing obnoxious in their beha|viour, except their ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;titions. He thinks, however, the matter &s;hould be inquired into: for chri&s;tianity had brought religion into great di&s;u&s;e. The markets were crouded with victims; and &s;carce a purcha&s;er came near them.</P>
<P>The&s;e writers afford us &s;ufficient te&s;|timony, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t lived, at the time we a&s;&s;ert; and that he was the author of a new religion. They had opportunities of being well informed; could have no intere&s;t in fal&s;ifying; were no converts to the new &s;ect; but

talk of Chri&s;t, only as they would of any &s;ingular per&s;on, whom they had oc|ca&s;ion to mention. Their te&s;timony therefore is beyond cavil.</P>

<P>Upon examining the grand &s;cripture evidence on this head, we find the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s laid upon miracles and prophecies; both of which are direct appeals to God, by a claim to &s;uperna|tural power <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The heathen had the &s;ame idea of a miracle, and a&s;cribed every thing he &s;aw, which was contrary to the common order of nature, to &s;ome miraculous power.

very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the fa|vourers of Je&s;us would rea&s;on, after his death, in a manner like this: and it is beyond credibility, that any of them would have continued his di&s;ciples, had they found him fal&s;ifying in this point. But we know they did continue his di&s;|ciples after this. We know al&s;o, that many pro&s;elytes, convinced by this very event, embraced the chri&s;tian religion. &mdash;We have all the rea&s;on in the world therefore to believe, that they were fully &s;atisfied.

<P>Again, with regard to prophecy, we ob&s;erve, that the writers of the old te&s;tament &s;eem, in various parts, to
<PB N="59" REF="62">
characterize &s;ome extraordinary per&s;on, who was in proce&s;s of time to make his appearance in the world. The marks are peculiar, and can neither be mi&s;taken nor mi&s;applied. "He was to be born of a virgin&mdash;he was to turn the hearts of the di&s;obedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t &mdash; though dignifyed with the characters of a prince, he was to be a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief&mdash;tho de&s;cribed to be with|out &s;in, he was to be numbered with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors&mdash;his hands and his feet were to be pierced&mdash;he was to be made an offering for &s;in&mdash;and was never to &s;ee corruption."&mdash;The&s;e prophecies were publi&s;hed many hundred years before the birth of Chri&s;t; and had been all along in the hands, not only of the Jews, but of all men of letters. The old te&s;tament had been early tran&s;lated
<PB N="60" REF="63">
into the greek language; and received into the polite&s;t libraries of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>With the&s;e ideas, let us open the new te&s;tament, and it is obvious, that no picture can be more like its original, than the&s;e prophecies of Chri&s;t in one te&s;tament, are to his hi&s;tory in the other. Here we &s;ee that extraordinary virgin-birth unravelled.&mdash; Here we &s;ee a life &s;pent in turning the hearts of the di&s;o|bedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t.&mdash; Here we find the prince of his people, a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief.&mdash;Here we &s;ee the Lord of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s numbered with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors&mdash; we &s;ee his hands and his feet pierced&mdash; we &s;ee him made an offering for &s;in&mdash; and we &s;ee realized that extraordinary idea of death without corruption.</P>
<P>It were an ea&s;y matter to carry this compari&s;on through a more minute de|tail
<PB N="61" REF="64">
of circum&s;tances: but I mean only to trace the outlines of this great re&s;em|blance. To compleat the picture would be a copious work.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e predictions, which related immediately to the life and death of Chri&s;t; there were many others, which de&s;erve notice. Among the&s;e, the two great leading prophecies, were tho&s;e of the calling of the Gentiles, and of the di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews.</P>
<P>The calling of the Gentiles was one of the earlie&s;t prophecies of the old te&s;tament. The Jews were di&s;tingui&s;hed in appearance, as the favourite peo|ple of God; and they were &s;ufficiently elated upon that di&s;tinction. But if they had attended clo&s;ely to their prophets, they might have di&s;covered, that all the prophecies, which de&s;cribed the happy
<PB N="62" REF="65">
&s;tate of the church, had evidently a more di&s;tant pro&s;pect, than to them. Tho&s;e early promi&s;es, in particular, which were repeated to the patriarchs, were not merely confined to their po&s;te|rity; but included "all the nations of the earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Gen.</HI> 12, iii. 18, xviii. 22, xviii. 26, iv.</NOTE>&mdash;And when the later pro|phets, as the great event approached, &s;poke a plainer, and a more intelligible language, the whole nation might have under&s;tood, as Simeon, and &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t intelligible of them did under&s;tand, that "a light was &s;prung up to lighten the Gentiles."</P>
<P>The prophecy of the di&s;per&s;ion of the jewi&s;h nation is al&s;o very antient, being attributed by Mo&s;es to the patriarch Jacob. "The &s;ceptre &s;hall not depart from Judah, until Shiloh come." What|ever may be the preci&s;e meaning of the word &s;ceptre in the original; and though
<PB N="63" REF="66">
it may not perhaps properly &s;ignify that idea of regal power, which it conveys to our ears; yet it certainly means &s;ome badge of authority, that implies a form|ed and &s;ettled government. And as to the word Shiloh, all commentators, jewi&s;h as well as chri&s;tian, explain it to mean the Me&s;&s;iah.&mdash;The &s;en&s;e therefore of the prophecy is plainly this&mdash;that the Jews &s;hould continue in the form of a &s;ociety, till the time of the Me&s;&s;iah. Accordingly we find, that, &s;oon after Chri&s;t's death, the &s;ceptre did depart from Judah: the Jews lo&s;t all form of a political &s;ociety; and are a &s;ingular in|&s;tance of a people, &s;cattered over the whole earth, pre&s;erved to this day &s;e|parate from all other people, and yet without a &s;ettlement any where.</P>
<P>Our Saviour's prophecy of the growth of his church, is likewi&s;e among the
<PB N="64" REF="67">
more remarkable predictions. He told his di&s;ciples, that "his religion was like a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which was the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds; but when it grew up, it &s;hould become a great tree, and the fowls of the air &s;hould lodge in the branches of it." He told them al&s;o, that "the gates of hell &s;hould never prevail again&s;t it."</P>
<P>The jewi&s;h religion was continually inforced by the idea of a jealous God, watching over it, and threatening judg|ments from heaven upon every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. The divine authority was &s;tamped openly upon it. The people trembled, and wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>When the impo&s;tor Mahomet &s;et up for a reformer, he could not indeed in|force his religion by divine judgments; but he did it by temporal. He drew
<PB N="65" REF="68">
his &s;word, and held it to the brea&s;ts of his oppo&s;ers; while he promi&s;ed to the obedient a full gratification of their pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>But in the chri&s;tian religion, nothing of this kind appeared. No temporal judgments threatened on one hand: no &s;en&s;ual indulgences allured on the other. A few de&s;ponding ignorant mechanics, the di&s;ciples of a per&s;on crucified as a common malefactor, were all the parade, with which this religion was u&s;hered in|to the world; and all the human a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, which it had to boa&s;t.&mdash;And yet this religion, which oppo&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices, and was oppo&s;ed by the greate&s;t princes, made its way in a few years, from a remote corner, through the whole Roman empire.&mdash; Thus was our Saviour's prophecy, in op|po&s;ition to all human calculation, exact|ly
<PB N="66" REF="69">
fulfilled. The lea&s;t of all &s;eeds be|came a &s;preading tree; and a church was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which could not be de|&s;troyed by all the powers of hell.</P>
<P>But although the church of Chri&s;t could not be de&s;troyed, it was corrup|ted; and in a cour&s;e of years fell from its genuine purity. This corrupt &s;tate of it&mdash;the delu&s;ions of popery&mdash;the ef|forts of reformation, and various other circum&s;tances relating to it, are not un|rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to be held forth, in the prophetic parts of the new te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>But I forbear to dwell upon prophe|phecies, which are not obvious enough to carry general conviction; tho many of them have been well explained by tho&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bp. Newton's di&s;&s;ertations; and Bp. Hurd's &s;ermons on prophecy.</HI></NOTE>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Objections to miracles, and prophe|cies&mdash;marks of di&s;tinction between true and fal&s;e miracles&mdash;between true and fal&s;e prophecies.&mdash;The truth of religion founded upon the combined force of its whole evidence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">AGAINST the evidence ari&s;ing from miracles, and prophecy, we are well aware of what the dei&s;t objects&mdash; that fal&s;e miracles have been wrought by impo&s;tors; and fallacious prophe|cies given out by oracles&mdash;and that we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the miracles, and pro|phecies of the bible to be better found|ed; or in any degree, a more re&s;pecta|ble criterion of truth.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, that a very palpable di&s;tinction may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the true miracle mu&s;t fall un|der the examination of men's natural &s;en&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Le&s;ley's &s;hort method with dei&s;ts.</HI></NOTE>. When a prie&s;t di&s;plays a phial full of blood, which &s;ometimes congeals, and &s;ometimes liquifies, he has no right to our credit, unle&s;s he &s;ubmit his phial to our examination. But when
<PB N="72" REF="73">
a man is rai&s;ed from the dead; when a man is cured of blindne&s;s; when two or three thou&s;and people are fed by a pittance, there can be no deception: our &s;en&s;es, which are the only compe|tent judges, have the means of judging.</P>
<P>Secondly, the true miracle mu&s;t be performed before credible witne&s;&s;es. A bu&s;ine&s;s huddled up in a cloi&s;ter, be|fore a few intere&s;ted monks, is not pro|perly atte&s;ted. But when an action is performed before the publick eye, as mo&s;t of the miracles of Chri&s;t were; or before witne&s;&s;es, who have totally ex|culpated them&s;elves of having any end, but that of truth, we have all the at|te&s;tation we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the true miracle mu&s;t have an elevated end in view. When we hear of a miracle abetting the intere&s;t of &s;ome
<PB N="73" REF="74">
little corrupt &s;ociety, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the Almighty concerned in &s;uch an e|vent. But the miracles of the go&s;pel had other ends. They were employed to u&s;her in an event, on which depended the &s;alvation of mankind.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the true miracle mu&s;t be handed down by authentic records, which, take their ri&s;e at the time, when the miracle was performed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Le&s;ley's &s;hort method with dei&s;ts.</HI></NOTE> A vague tradition, or an undated, legendary tale, is no record. But the chri&s;tian may with great propriety appeal to the &s;crip|tures, which he fir&s;t proves were writ|ten at the time, when the events they relate, were performed.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the torture of que&s;tion tends greatly to authenticate the real miracle. The fal&s;e one abhors inquiry. At the reformation detections were abundant.
<PB N="74" REF="75">
But after the mo&s;t rigorous que&s;tion, the go&s;pel-miracles have maintained their credit through the &s;pace of &s;even|teen hundred years.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out a few topics of di&s;tinction between true, and fal&s;e miracles; it is as ea&s;y to point them out between true, and fal&s;e prophe|cies.&mdash;The true prophecy, like the true miracle, has a more elevated end, and a more enlarged plan.</P>
<P>When we meet with a prophecy, the avowed end of which is to &s;atisfy &s;ome trivial curio&s;ity, or abet the de&s;igns of &s;ome ambitious leader, &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t needs take the alarm. This was evi|dently the character of the ancient ora|cles. However directed, whether by bad men, or bad &s;pirits, they certainly &s;poke as they were paid, or intimidated.
<PB N="75" REF="76">
But in the prophecies of the bible we find a different &s;tyle. Marked neither by intere&s;ted views, nor by &s;ervile com|pliances, they advance uniformly the &s;ame great end, which its miracles al&s;o propo&s;ed, the &s;alvation of a ruined world.</P>
<P>Secondly, neither men, nor evil &s;pi|rits ever gave an in&s;tance of the power of foretelling future events upon any enlarged plan. What were the deci&s;ions of oracles, but quibling an&s;wers to &s;ome pre&s;ent que&s;tion? Or opinions, to which human fore&s;ight was equal? Or at be&s;t the predictions of events confined to &s;ome &s;hort &s;pan of time? When did any oracle foretel an event a thou&s;and years before its completion? Or from which of them do we find a &s;eries of prophecy i&s;&s;uing through dif|ferent ages, the whole concurring in
<PB N="76" REF="77">
one point, and yet in every particular exactly fulfilled?</P>
<P>Thus much in an&s;wer to the particu|lar objections of the dei&s;t; but let me farther add, (as a caution again&s;t his arts,) that we mean not to ground the truth of our religion upon detached parts, even upon miracles, and prophecies con|&s;idered alone: but upon the whole &s;cheme, and combined force of its evi|dence. In this way we judge of every thing el&s;e; and when we judge other|wi&s;e, we &s;hall probably make a fal&s;e e&s;ti|mate. Who would judge of a building from a column; or of a country from a field? And yet in this partial view, the dei&s;t chiefly forms his cavils; and imagines, he has gained a complete vic|tory, when he tells us, that the mi|racles of the go&s;pel are marked with the &s;ame characters, as the &s;orceries of
<PB N="77" REF="78">
evil &s;pirits; and its prophecies are ju&s;t as incredible as the divinations of ora|cles. We &s;hould recommend it to him therefore to inlarge his views; and ex|amine the whole chain of evidence from the earlie&s;t accounts of time.</P>
<P>Let him fir&s;t con&s;ider that remarkable promi&s;e of "brui&s;ing the &s;erpent's head," which was given as &s;oon as the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion was committed. This was the fir&s;t dawn of hope, which God vouch|&s;afed to a guilty world: and though the figurative language, under which it is couched, was dubious and ob&s;cure; yet its meaning, though not fully un|der&s;tood, was ea&s;ily conceived to con|tain &s;ome promi&s;e of victory over the adver&s;ary of mankind.</P>
<P>In a few ages after, its meaning was more opened; and the hopes of an in|fant-world,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
thus rai&s;ed, were increa&s;ed by a very remarkable promi&s;e, that in the i&s;&s;ue of one of the patriarchs, "all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed." And what is &s;till more remarkable, the promi&s;e was repeated three &s;everal times. &mdash;Here, not only a victory over an enemy was announced; but a &s;tate of happine&s;s in &s;ome &s;hape was declared.</P>
<P>Let him next trace the&s;e hopes &s;till increa&s;ing, and opening more and more through every age. In the patri|archal hi&s;tory, the &s;acrifice of I&s;aac, the deliverance from Egypt, the promi&s;ed land, and a variety of other incidents, have much more dignity, and meaning, when we con&s;ider them, not barely as hi&s;tory; but as typical events leading the mind forward in the contemplation of &s;ome great &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">Still more will he find the&s;e hopes excited by the types and ceremonies of the jewi&s;h law, which &s;eem to have had little meaning, if they had no conceal|ed one; and by the &s;acrifices, which prevailed over the greate&s;t part of the known world&mdash;all pointing &s;trongly at a particular mode of &s;alvation, through a mediator, an atonement, and an offer|ing for &s;in.</P>
<P>When he has examined the&s;e &s;ilent notices, let him next &s;urvey the pro|phetic writers of the old te&s;tament.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="91" REF="91">WE have now &s;hewn upon what foundation we believe the &s;e|cond article of our creed, let us next con&s;ider the remaining articles&mdash;the hi&s;|tory of Chri&s;t, as delivered in &s;cripture, and the benefits which he procured for us&mdash;the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit&mdash; the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins&mdash;and everla&s;t|ing life.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, we believe, that Chri&s;t was "conceived of the Holy Gho&s;t, and born of the virgin Mary." The manner of this miraculous conception we inquire not into. It is a point not only beyond the limits of human inqui|ry; but to us at lea&s;t a point very un|important. We believe ju&s;t the &s;crip|ture account of it, and a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that if it had concerned us, it would have been more plainly revealed.&mdash;One
<PB N="92" REF="92">
thing, however, we may ob&s;erve on this head, that nothing is &s;aid in &s;cripture of paying divine honours to the virgin Mary. Tho&s;e rites are totally of popi&s;h origin.</P>
<P>We farther believe, that Chri&s;t "&s;uf|fered under Pontius Pilate, was cruci|fied, dead, and buried; and that he de|&s;cended into hell,"&mdash;that is, we de|clare our belief of the &s;cripture-account of the circum&s;tances and the reality of Chri&s;t's death.</P>
<P>To make an action clear, it is nece&s;|&s;ary, fir&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h its date. This is u&s;ually done by ranging it under the magi&s;trate who then pre&s;ided, the time of who&s;e government is always regi&s;ter|ed in &s;ome public record.&mdash;Thus we believe that Chri&s;t's death happened when Pontius Pilate was governor of
<PB N="93" REF="93">
Judea. We believe al&s;o, with regard to the manner of his death, that he was crucified; that he died as really as any mortal ever did; and that he was bu|ried in the tomb of Jo&s;eph of Arima|thea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>I&s;aiah foretold he &s;hould "make his grave with the rich." And St. Matthew tells us, that <GAP DESC="foreign">.</HI></P>

<P>The "de&s;cent into hell" is undoubt|edly a more ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ion than might be wi&s;hed in a creed, and was not indeed added till many ages after the creed was fir&s;t compo&s;ed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bingham's Antiquities, vol. <HI>iii.</HI> c. <HI>3.</HI></HI></NOTE>. But as creeds are human compo&s;itions, we be|lieve this, and every other difficulty, only as con&s;i&s;tent with &s;cripture. Now the &s;en&s;e which &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to &s;cripture, is, that his &s;oul remained till
<PB N="94" REF="94">
his re&s;urrection in that place (whatever that place is) where the &s;pirits of the ble&s;&s;ed re&s;t: and the expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to have been added, only that we may the more &s;trongly expre&s;s our belief of the reality of his death. This we do, when we expre&s;s our belief of the &s;epa|ration of his &s;oul and body. "He was buried,"&mdash;and "de&s;cended into hell." The fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion relates to his body, which was laid in the grave; the &s;econd to his &s;oul, which pa&s;&s;ed into the place of departed &s;pirits.</P>
<P>We farther believe, that "on the third day he ro&s;e again from the dead." The re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead is a point of the utmo&s;t import|ance to chri&s;tians. On the certainty of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection depend all hopes of our own. On this article, therefore, we &s;hall be more large.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">And, in the fir&s;t place, what is there in it that need &s;hock our rea&s;on? It was a wonderful event: But is not nature full of wonderful events? When we &s;eriou&s;ly weigh the matter, is it le&s;s &s;trange, that a grain of corn thrown into the ground &s;hould die, and ri&s;e again with new vegetation, than that a human body, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, &s;hould a&s;&s;ume new life? The common|ne&s;s of the former makes it familiar to us, but not in any degree le&s;s unac|countable. Are we at all more ac|quainted with the manner in which grain germinates, than with the manner in which a body is rai&s;ed from the dead? And is it not obviou&s;ly &s;triking, that the &s;ame power which can effect the one, may effect the other al&s;o?&mdash;But analogy, though it tend to convince, is no proof. Let us proceed then to mat|ter of fact.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="96">That the body was dead, and &s;afely lodged in the tomb, and afterwards conveyed out of it, was agreed on, both by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed, and by tho&s;e who favoured the re&s;urrection. In the circum&s;tances of the latter fact, they differ widely.</P>
<P>The di&s;ciples tell their &s;tory&mdash;a very plain and &s;imple one&mdash;that, &s;carce ex|pecting the event, notwith&s;tanding their ma&s;ter had him&s;elf foretold it, they were &s;urpri&s;ed with an account, that the bo|dy was gone&mdash;that they found after|wards, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment, that their ma&s;ter was again alive&mdash;that they had been &s;everal times with him; and appealed for the truth of what they &s;aid to great numbers, who, as well as them|&s;elves, had &s;een him after his re&s;urrec|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="97">The chief prie&s;ts, on the other &s;ide, declared the whole to be a forgery; a&s;|&s;erting, that the plain matter of fact was, the di&s;ciples came by night, and &s;tole the body away, while the &s;oldiers &s;lept.</P>
<P>Such a tale, un&s;upported by evidence, would be li&s;tened to in no court of ju&s;|tice. It has not even the air of proba|bility. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the di&s;ciples, who had fled with terror when they might have re&s;cued their ma&s;ter's life; would venture, in the face of an armed guard, to carry off his dead bo|dy?&mdash;Or is it more probable, that they found the whole guard a&s;leep; when we know, that the vigilance of centi|nels is &s;ecured by the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;ci|pline?&mdash;Be&s;ides, what advantage could ari&s;e from &s;uch an attempt? If they mi&s;carried, it was certain ruin, both to them and their cau&s;e. If they &s;uc|ceeded,
<PB N="98" REF="98">
it is difficult to &s;ay what u&s;e they could make of their &s;ucce&s;s. Un|le&s;s they could have produced their dead body alive, the &s;econd error would be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. Their ma&s;ter's prophecy of his own re&s;urrection was an unhappy circum&s;tance; yet &s;till it was wrapped in a veil of ob&s;curity. But if his di&s;ciples endeavoured to prove its completion, it was their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to look well to the event. A de|tection would be &s;uch a comment up|on their ma&s;ter's text, as would never be forgotten.&mdash;When a cau&s;e depends on fal&s;ehood, every body knows, the le&s;s it is moved the better.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e of the other &s;ide. Ob&s;curity there was wanted. If the chief prie&s;ts had any proof, why did they not produce it? Why were not the di&s;ciples taken up, and examined
<PB N="99" REF="99">
upon the fact? They never ab&s;cond|ed. Why were they not judicially tried? Why was not the trial made public? And why were not authentic memorials of the fraud handed down to po&s;terity; as authentic memorials were of the fact, recorded at the very time, and place, where it happened? Chri&s;|tianity never wanted enemies to propa|gate its di&s;paragement.&mdash;But nothing of this kind was done. No proof was at|tempted&mdash;except indeed the te&s;timony of men a&s;leep. The di&s;ciples were ne|ver que&s;tioned upon the fact; and the chief prie&s;ts re&s;ted &s;atisfied with &s;pread|ing an incon&s;i&s;tent rumour among the people, impre&s;&s;ed merely by their own authority.</P>
<P>Whatever records of heathen origin remain, evince the truth of the re&s;ur|rection. One is very remarkable.

<P>Having &s;een what was of old object|ed to the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, it may be proper al&s;o to &s;ee the objections of modern di&s;believers.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="102">And, fir&s;t, we have the &s;tale objec|tion, that nothing is more common a|mong the propagators of every new re|ligion, than to delude their ignorant pro&s;elytes with idle &s;tories.

And can we &s;uppo&s;e better of the re&s;urrec|tion of Chri&s;t, than that it was one of tho&s;e pious frauds, intended merely to impo&s;e upon the people, and advance the credit of the new &s;ect?</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t as ea&s;ily &s;aid, as that his di&s;ciples &s;tole him away, while the guard &s;lept. Both are a&s;&s;ertions without proof. But this objection, I tru&s;t, we have already an&s;wered, when we en|deavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h certain topics of
<PB N="103" REF="103">
di&s;tinction, between true and fal&s;e mi|racles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page</HI> 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Others have objected Chri&s;t's partial di&s;covery of him&s;elf, after his re&s;urrec|tion. If he had boldly &s;hewn him|&s;elf to the chief prie&s;ts; or publickly to all the people; we might have had a more rational foundation for our belief. But as he had only for his witne&s;&s;es, upon this occa&s;ion, a few of his cho&s;en companions, the thing has certainly a more &s;ecret appearance than might be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>This in&s;inuation is founded upon a pa&s;&s;age in the acts of the apo&s;tles, in which it is &s;aid, that "God &s;hewed him openly, not to all the people, but unto witne&s;&s;es cho&s;en before of God." The que&s;tion is, what is meant by wit|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="104" REF="104">
cho&s;en before of God? Certainly nothing more than per&s;ons expre&s;ly, and by particular de&s;ignation intend|ed to be the witne&s;&s;es of this event. Others might &s;ee him, if they plea&s;ed; but the&s;e were not the people, to whom God &s;hewed him openly: this particular de&s;ignation was confined to the "cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es."&mdash;And is there any thing more in this, than we &s;ee daily in all legal proceedings? Does not every body wi&s;h to have the fact, about which he is concerned, authenti|cated by indubitable records; or by living te&s;timony, if it can be had? Do we not procure the hands of witne&s;&s;es, appointed to this purpo&s;e, in all our deeds and writings?&mdash;Let us not, how|ever, an&s;wer the objection by an arbi|trary explanation of the text: but let us compare this explanation with the matter of fact.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="105">On the morning of the re&s;urrection, the apo&s;tles, who ran to the &s;epulchre to make them&s;elves acquainted with what they had heard, received a me&s;|&s;age from their ma&s;ter, injoining them, to meet him in Galilee. It does not appear, that this me&s;&s;age was conveyed with any &s;ecrecy: it is rather probable it was not; and that the di&s;ciples told it to as many as they met. The wo|men, it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, told it "to the eleven, and all the re&s;t." Who the re&s;t were, does not appear: but it is plain from the &s;equel, that the thing was ge|nerally known; and that as many as cho&s;e either to &s;atisfy their faith, or gratify their curio&s;ity, repaired for that purpo&s;e to Galilee. And thus we find St. Peter making a di&s;tinction between the voluntary and the cho&s;en witne&s;s&mdash; between tho&s;e "who had companied with the apo&s;tles all the time, that the Lord
<PB N="106" REF="106">
Je&s;us went in and out among them, from his bapti&s;m till his a&s;cen&s;ion," and tho&s;e who "were ordained to be the wit|ne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> i. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>St. Paul goes farther, and in expre&s;s words tells us, that Chri&s;t was &s;een <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv.</NOTE> "after his re&s;urrection of above five hundred brethren at once:" and it is probable, from the expre&s;&s;ion, "at once," that he was &s;een, at different times, by many more.</P>
<P>If then Chri&s;t thus appeared in Ga|lilee to as many as cho&s;e to &s;ee him; or even if he appeared only to five hun|dred people, of whom St. Paul tells us, the greate&s;t part were &s;till alive, when he wrote his epi&s;tle, there can &s;urely be no rea&s;onable cau&s;e of offence at his appearing, be&s;ides the&s;e, to a few of his
<PB N="107" REF="107">
cho&s;en companions, who attended by expre&s;s appointment, as per&s;ons de&s;ign|ed to record the event.</P>
<P>In fact, if the &s;ame method be pur|&s;ued in this inquiry, which is u&s;ual in all others, the evidence of the&s;e cho&s;en companions is all that is nece&s;&s;ary. Here are twelve men produced (in ge|neral three or four men are thought &s;uf|ficient) on who&s;e evidence the fact de|pends. Are they competent witne&s;&s;es? Have they tho&s;e marks about them, which characteri&s;e men of integrity? Can they be challenged on any one ground of rational exception? If not, their evidence is as &s;trictly legal, as full, and as &s;atisfactory, as any rea&s;on|able man can require.&mdash;But in this great cau&s;e, we &s;ee the evidence is car|ried &s;till farther. Here are five hun|dred per&s;ons waiting without, ready to
<PB N="108" REF="108">
add their te&s;timony, if any one &s;hould require it, to what has already been more than legally proved. So that the argument even addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to that ab&s;urd di&s;tinction, which we often find in the cavils of infidelity, between rem certam, and rem certi&s;&s;imam.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, then, we may af|firm boldly, that this great event of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is founded upon evidence equal to the importance of it. If we expect &s;till more, our an&s;wer is upon record: "If ye believe not Mo|&s;es and the prophets," God's ordinary means of &s;alvation, "neither will ye be per&s;uaded, though one ro&s;e from the dead."&mdash;There mu&s;t be bounds in all human evidence; and he who will be|lieve noting, unle&s;s he have every po&s;|&s;ible mode of proof, mu&s;t be an infidel in almo&s;t every tran&s;action of life.
<PB N="109" REF="109">
With &s;uch per&s;ons there is no rea&s;on|ing. They who are not &s;atisfied, be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t did not appear in open pa|rade at Jeru&s;alem; would farther have a&s;ked, if he had appeared in the manner they expected, why did he not appear to every nation upon earth? Or perhaps, why he did not &s;hew him&s;elf to every individual?</P>
<P>To the&s;e objections may be added a &s;cruple, taken from a pa&s;&s;age of &s;crip|ture, in which it is &s;aid that "Chri&s;t &s;hould lye three days, and three nights in the heart of the earth:" whereas, in fact, he only lay two nights, one whole day, and a part of two others.</P>
<P>But no figure in &s;peech is more com|mon than that of putting a part for the whole. In the Hebrew language per|haps this licence is more admi&s;&s;able,
<PB N="110" REF="110">
than in any other. A day and a night complete one whole day; and as our Sa|viour lay in the ground a part of every one of the&s;e three portions of time, he might be &s;aid, by an ea&s;y liberty of &s;peech, to have lain the whole.</P>

to explore unbeaten regions, hath often been tempted, beyond its limits, into fruitle&s;s inquiries; &s;crutinizing the time of this event; and &s;ettling with vain preci&s;ion, the circum&s;tances of it. All curio&s;ity of this kind is idle at lea&s;t; if not pre&s;umptuous. When the Al|mighty hath thrown a veil over any part of his di&s;pen&s;ation, it is the folly of man to endeavour to draw it a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Let us then leave all fruitle&s;s inquiries about this great event; and employ our thoughts chiefly upon &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces of it, as mo&s;t concern us.&mdash;Let us animate our hopes with the &s;oothing reflection, that we have our &s;entence, in a manner, in our own power,&mdash;that the &s;ame gracious go&s;pel, which directs our lives, &s;hall direct the judgment we re|ceive,&mdash;that the &s;ame gracious per&s;on,

<P>But le&s;t our hopes &s;hould be too buoyant, let us con&s;ider, on the other hand, what an awful detail again&s;t us will then appear. The &s;ubject of that grand enquiry will be all our tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions of known duty&mdash;all our omi&s;&s;ions of knowing better&mdash;our &s;ecret intenti|ons&mdash;our indulged evil-thoughts&mdash;the bad motives, which often accompany our mo&s;t plau&s;ible actions&mdash;and, we are told, even our idle words.&mdash;"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."&mdash;Then &s;hall it be known, whether we have an|&s;wered the great ends of life?&mdash;Whe|ther we have made this world &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to a better?&mdash;Whether we have

prepared our&s;elves for a &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s in heaven, by endeavouring to com|municate happine&s;s to our fellow-crea|tures upon earth? Whether we have re&s;trained our appetites, and pa&s;&s;ions; and reduced them within the bounds of rea&s;on and religion? Or, whether we have given our&s;elves up to plea&s;ure, gain, or ambition; and formed &s;uch at|tachments to this world, as fit us for nothing el&s;e; and leave us no hopes ei|ther of gaining, or of enjoying a better? It will be happy for us, if on all the&s;e heads of inquiry, we can an&s;wer with|out di&s;may.&mdash;Worldly di&s;tinctions, we know, will then be of no avail.

<P>We believe, farther, in "the Holy Gho&s;t;" that is, we believe every thing which the &s;criptures tell us of the Holy Spirit of God.&mdash;We inquire not into the nature of its union with the God|head. We take it for granted, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, have &s;ome kind of union, and
<PB N="122" REF="121">
&s;ome kind of di&s;tinction; becau&s;e both this union and this di&s;tinction are plain|ly pointed out in &s;cripture; but how they exi&s;t, we inquire not; concluding here, as in other points of difficulty, that if a clearer information had been nece&s;&s;ary, it would have been afforded.</P>
<P>With regard to the operations of the Holy Spirit of God, (be&s;ides which, little more on this head is revealed) we believe, that it directed the apo&s;tles, and enabled them to propagate the go|&s;pel&mdash;and that it will a&s;&s;i&s;t all good men in the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of a pious life.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture-doctrine, with regard to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we receive from the Holy Spirit of God, (which is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of this article) is briefly this.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="122">Our be&s;t endeavours are in&s;ufficient. We are unprofitable &s;ervants, after all; and cannot plea&s;e God, unle&s;s &s;ancti|fied, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Holy Spirit. Hence the life of a good man hath been &s;ometimes called a &s;tanding miracle; &s;omething beyond the common cour&s;e of nature. To attain any degree of goodne&s;s, we mu&s;t be &s;upernaturally a&s;|&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, we are a&s;&s;ured of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if we &s;trive to obtain it by fervent prayer, and a pious life. If we tru&s;t in our&s;elves, we &s;hall fail. If we tru&s;t in God, without doing all we can our&s;elves, we &s;hall fail likewi&s;e. And if we continue ob&s;tinate in our perver&s;ene&s;s, we may at length totally incapacitate our&s;elves from being the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="123">And indeed what is there in all this, which common life does not daily illu&s;|trate? Is any thing more common, than for the intellect of one man to a&s;|&s;i&s;t that of another? Is not the whole &s;cheme of education an infu&s;ion of knowledge and virtue not our own? Is it not evident too, that nothing of this kind can be communicated without ap|plication on the part of the learner? Are not the efforts of the teacher in a manner nece&s;&s;arily proportioned to this application? If the learner becomes lan|guid in his pur&s;uits, are not the endea|vours of the teacher of cour&s;e di&s;couraged? And will they not at length wholly fail, if it be found in the end they an&s;wer no purpo&s;e?&mdash;In a manner analogous to this, the Holy Spirit of God co-operates with the endeavours of man. Our en|deavours are nece&s;&s;ary to obtain God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and the more earne&s;tly the&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="124">
endeavours are exerted, the mea&s;ure of this grace will of cour&s;e be greater. But, on the other hand, if the&s;e endea|vours langui&s;h, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven will le&s;&s;en in proportion; and if we be|have with ob&s;tinate perver&s;ene&s;s, it will by degrees wholly fail. It will not al|ways &s;trive with man; but will leave him a melancholy prey to his own vi|cious inclinations.</P>
<P>As to the manner, in which this &s;pi|ritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance is conveyed, we make no inquiry. We can as little compre|hend it, as we can the action of our &s;ouls upon our bodies. We are &s;en&s;i|ble, that our &s;ouls do act upon our bo|dies; and it is a belief equally con&s;o|nant to rea&s;on, that the divine influence may act upon our &s;ouls. The advocate for natural religion need not be remind|ed, that among the heathens, a divine

influence was a received opinion. The prie&s;ts of every oracle were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;pired by their gods; and the he|roes of antiquity were univer&s;ally be|lieved to act under the influence of a &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance; by which it was conceived they performed actions be|yond human power <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Non haec humanis opibus, non arte magi&s;tra: Major agit Deus, atque opera ad majora remittit.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="131" REF="128">WE believe, farther, in the "holy catholic church," and the "communion of &s;aints."</P>
<P>"I believe in the holy catholic church," is certainly a very ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ion to a prote&s;tant; as it is very capable of a popi&s;h con&s;truction, implying our tru&s;t in the infallibility of the church; where|as we attribute infallibility to no church upon earth. The mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e, therefore, in which it can be con&s;idered as a prote&s;tant article of belief, is this, that we call no particular &s;ociety of chri&s;tians a holy catholic church; but believe, that all true and &s;incere chri&s;|tians, of whatever communion, or par|ticular opinion, &s;hall be the objects of God's mercy. The patriarchal cove|nant was confined to a few. The jewi&s;h church &s;tood al&s;o on a very narrow ba|&s;is. But the chri&s;tian church, we be|lieve,
<PB N="132" REF="129">
is truly catholic: its gracious of|fers are made to all mankind; and God through Chri&s;t will take out of every nation &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The "communion of &s;aints," is an expre&s;&s;ion equally ob&s;cure: and what|ever might have been the original mean|ing of it, it certainly does not re&s;olve it&s;elf into a very obvious one to us. If we &s;ay, we mean by it, that good chri&s;|tians living together on earth, &s;hould exerci&s;e all offices of charity among them&s;elves, no one will contradict the article; but many perhaps may a&s;k, Why is it made an article of faith? It relates not &s;o much to faith, as to prac|tice: and the ten commandments might ju&s;t as well be introduced as articles of our belief.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="130">To this I can only &s;ugge&s;t, that it may have a place among the articles of our creed, as a te&s;t of our enlarged ideas of chri&s;tianity, and as oppo&s;ed to the narrow-mindedne&s;s of &s;ome chri&s;tians, who harbour very uncharitable opinions again&s;t all who are not of their own church; and &s;cruple not to &s;hew their opinions by uncharitable actions. The papi&s;ts particularly deny &s;alvation to any but tho&s;e of their own communion, and per&s;ecute tho&s;e of other per&s;ua&s;ions where they have the power.&mdash;In oppo|&s;ition to this, we profe&s;s our belief of the great chri&s;tian law of charity. We believe we ought to think charitably of good chri&s;tians of all denominations; and ought to practi&s;e a free and unre|&s;trained communion of charitable of|fices towards them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="131">In this light the &s;econd part of the article depends upon the fir&s;t. By the "holy catholic church," we mean all &s;incere chri&s;tians, of whatever church, or peculiarity of opinion; and by "the communion of &s;aints," a kind and cha|ritable behaviour towards them.</P>
<P>Though it is probable this was not the original meaning of the article, yet as the reformers of the liturgy did not think it proper to make an alteration, we are led to &s;eek &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as ap|pears mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with &s;cripture.&mdash; We are a&s;&s;ured, that this article, as well as the "de&s;cent into hell," is not of the &s;ame antiquity as the re&s;t of the creed. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bingham's Antiq. vol. <HI>iv.</HI> chap. <HI>3.</HI></HI></NOTE></P>
<P>We profe&s;s our belief farther in the "forgivene&s;s of &s;ins."&mdash;The &s;cripture-doctrine
<PB N="135" REF="132">
of &s;in, and of the guilt, which ari&s;es from it, is this.</P>
<P>Man was originally created in a &s;tate of innocence, yet liable to fall. Had he per&s;evered in his obedience, he might have enjoyed that happine&s;s, which is the con&s;equence of perfect virtue. But when this happy &s;tate was lo&s;t, his pa&s;|&s;ions and appetites became di&s;ordered, and prone to evil. Since that time we have all been, more or le&s;s, involved in &s;in, and are all therefore, in the &s;crip|ture-language, "under the cur&s;e;" that is, we are naturally in a &s;tate of un|pardoned guilt.</P>
<P>In this mournful exigence, what was to be done? In a &s;tate of nature, it is true, we might be &s;orry for our &s;ins. Nature too might dictate repentance. But &s;orrow and repentance, though they
<PB N="136" REF="133">
may put us on our guard for the fu|ture, can make no atonement for &s;ins already committed. A re&s;olution to run no more into debt may make us cautious; but can never di&s;charge a debt already contracted. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Thus Mr. Jenyns expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thing:</HI> <Q>The puni&s;hment of vice is a debt due to ju&s;tice, which cannot be remitted without compen&s;ation: repen|tance can be no compen&s;ation. It may change a wicked man's di&s;po&s;itions, and prevent his offending for the future; but can lay no claim to pardon for what is pa&s;t. If any one by profligacy and extra|vagance contracts a debt, repentance may make him wi&s;er, and hinder him from running into far|ther di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but can never pay off his old bonds, for which he mu&s;t be ever accountable, unle&s;s they are di&s;charged by him&s;elf, or &s;ome other in his &s;tead.

<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s of nature, Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world. He threw a light upon the gloom that &s;urrounded us.&mdash; He &s;hewed us, that in this world we
<PB N="137" REF="134">
were lo&s;t&mdash;that the law of nature could not &s;ave us&mdash;that the tenor of that law was perfect obedience, with which we could not comply&mdash;but that God, thro his mediation, offered us a method of regaining happine&s;s&mdash;that he came to make that atonement for us, which we could not make for our&s;elves&mdash;and to redeem us from that guilt, which would otherwi&s;e overwhelm us&mdash;that faith and obedience were, on our parts, the con|ditions required in this gracious cove|nant&mdash;and that God promi&s;ed us, on his, the pardon of our &s;ins, and ever|la&s;ting life&mdash;that we were fir&s;t therefore to be made holy through the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and then we might expect &s;al|vation through his death: "Us, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, would he quicken. Chri&s;t would redeem us from the cur&s;e of the law. By grace we &s;hould be &s;aved through faith; and
<PB N="138" REF="135">
that not of our&s;elves: it was the gift of God. Not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t"</P>
<P>This doctrine is generally called the &s;atisfaction or the atonement of Chri&s;t, and has given more offence to the dei&s;t than almo&s;t any part of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme. "Could not God, he cries, forgive us freely, and &s;ave us without an expedient which &s;ounds &s;o har&s;hly in our ears? The Son of God comes down upon earth, and &s;uffers death&mdash; for what? Why to take upon him&s;elf the &s;ins of man; and, in the &s;cripture-phra&s;e, to nail them to his cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This is &s;urely unbecoming language. How can any one pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that we may be forgiven freely, unle&s;s he can perfectly &s;can, and thoroughly under&s;tand, God's whole &s;cheme of mo|ral
<PB N="139" REF="136">
government? What do we know of the nature of unatoned &s;in and guilt? or of the immutable laws of eternal ju&s;|tice? Can the dei&s;t give us any account of the&s;e things? Or can he reconcile &s;in and ju&s;tice in &s;o &s;atisfactory a manner, even to human rea&s;on, as the &s;cripture does, in the account it gives us of the fall of man, and of his re&s;toration through Chri&s;t? Nothing is more ea&s;y than to cavil; nothing more difficult than to form a con&s;i&s;tent plan in oppo&s;ition to the truth.</P>
<P>Again, how can the dei&s;t talk of the redemption of the world by Chri&s;t, as an expedient that &s;ounds &s;o har&s;hly in our ears? It is true, it is an a&s;toni&s;h|ing event, and, in all its greatne&s;s, wholly new and unparallelled: but yet, when God has revealed it to us, our rea|&s;on totally clo&s;es with it. We are recon|ciled
<PB N="140" REF="137">
to it by ob&s;erving it analogous to God's whole &s;cheme of moral govern|ment; and to the u&s;e of &s;acrifices, which every where prevailed in the world.</P>
<P>What is the whole &s;tate of infancy and youth, from one end to the other, but a continued &s;cene of preventing, and of re&s;cuing from evils, at the expence of pains, and care, and &s;uffering, in the ma&s;ter, the friend, the parent, or who|ever acts the part of the kind media|tor?&mdash;How many, again, after they are advanced in life, do we daily &s;ee brought into &s;uch circum&s;tances, that, without the friendly mediation of their fellow-creatures, they would be totally ruined? Some, through the means of others, are relieved from painful di&s;|orders, under which they might have langui&s;hed to the end of life. Others, again, through their follies and exce&s;|&s;es
<PB N="141" REF="138">
have brought their affairs into &s;uch a &s;tate of ruin, as could never be re|deemed, unle&s;s their friends, by an ex|pen&s;ive mediation, &s;hould interfere.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances, and many others, that might be drawn from the circle and commerce of human life, and ma|ny, in which innocence &s;uffers for guilt, &s;hows at lea&s;t, that the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t for mankind, and the redemp|tion of the world through tho&s;e &s;uffer|ings, are analogous to that &s;tated order of things, and ordinary cour&s;e of moral government, which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. If our rea&s;on be not &s;hocked in one ca&s;e, why &s;hould it be &s;o in the other?&mdash;Let us then take in the whole &s;cheme of things, and not garble it as we plea&s;e. Let us bold|ly and athei&s;tically call God's whole plan of moral government a &s;cheme of

<P>The dei&s;t may be farther a&s;ked, What he thinks of the origin of &s;acri|fices? A &s;acrifice is a rite &s;o apparent|ly ab&s;urd, that one would hardly ima|gine any one could pre&s;cribe it to him|&s;elf: and yet we know, that all nations, however remote, and unconnected with each other, joined in it with one con|&s;ent.&mdash;Let us pre&s;s the dei&s;t a little up|on this head.

and &s;o continued, as a type of that great &s;acrifice, which was afterwards to be offered for the &s;ins of men?&mdash;A type, we know, is intended as an intro|duction to the thing typified: and men through all ages, from father to &s;on, have acquie&s;ced in a practice, without knowing from whence they had it, that they might &s;ilently fulfil, though with|out intending it, the &s;ecret purpo&s;es of heaven; which meant by this rite to in|troduce gradually the idea of that great &s;acrifice which was to be made for the &s;ins of the world; and which, however late it became vi&s;ible, was &s;lain in effect "from the foundation of the world," and be|gan unque&s;tionably to operate for the good of man, from the in&s;tant of the fall. Sacrifices might perhaps then be, what the Lord's &s;upper now is, a &s;ort partaking of the body and blood of Chri&s;t. And what is &s;till more remark|able,
<PB N="145" REF="142">
the type became univer&s;ally abo|li&s;hed, wherever it became fulfilled.</P>
<P>Does the unbeliever acquie&s;ce in this account of the origin of &s;acrifice? Or, will he rather re&s;olve it into &s;ome gene|ral deduction of human rea&s;on, and at|tribute it to the mere invention of man?</P>
<P>Be it &s;o. On this ground let us fol|low him: and on this ground he mu&s;t at lea&s;t allow, that the u&s;e of &s;acrifice proves all mankind to have had, from nature, an idea, that they &s;tood in need of other merits, be&s;ides their own, to re|deem them from &s;in&mdash;that the light of rea&s;on pointed the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome a|tonement to make up their own defi|ciences&mdash;and that offering the life of an innocent creature for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, came the neare&s;t of any thing, they could conceive, to the idea of &s;uch an atonement.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="143">Thus this great article of our faith, though &s;o offen&s;ive to many of the ad|vocates for rea&s;on, appears both &s;imilar to God's moral government, and agree|able to the general &s;en&s;e of mankind. God is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and for ever: and a connection, a unifor|mity, and analogy run through all his works, if it was in our power to trace them with accuracy, and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the unbeliever &s;till inquires farther; and cannot acquie&s;ce without a plain account of the manner, in which the death of Chri&s;t &s;atisfies God for the &s;ins of the world, we mu&s;t here be con&s;train|ed to leave him. In &s;uch inquiries he will rarely meet with &s;atisfaction. But let him be con&s;i&s;tent. Let him be an uni|ver&s;al &s;ceptic. Let him doubt a future &s;tate. Let him doubt the immortality of his &s;oul. Let him doubt even his own ex|i&s;tence: for which of the&s;e things can
<PB N="147" REF="144">
he explain?&mdash;If we think ju&s;tly, we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between what is, and what is not, capable of proof. Let us try the truth of &s;cripture by every me|thod, that human rea&s;on can invent: but let us not imagine, that human rea&s;on can comprehend the whole &s;y&s;tem of the Chri&s;tian religion. We enter freely into a rational proof of the being of a God: but we do not pre&s;ume to comprehend his attributes. What relates to man in the &s;cheme of our redemption is very clear. God's part indeed is beyond our comprehen&s;ion. But with this we have little to do. What is it to us, in what manner God performs this gracious work? Our concern lies nearer home. God has of|fered us the pardon of our &s;ins, and everla&s;ting life through the merits of Chri&s;t. But if, in the nicene&s;s of our ca&s;ui&s;try, we reject this offer,&mdash;we may
<PB N="148" REF="145">
have rea&s;on to repent&mdash;if we reject it through negligence, we certainly &s;hall.</P>
<P>That we may have a more complete view of the danger of &s;in, (the cau&s;e of our mi&s;ery, and of our Saviour's death) I &s;hall conclude this article with enume|rating its &s;everal kinds.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t I &s;hall mention the lighte&s;t in this catalogue, &s;ins of ignorance. A man may commit a &s;in without know|ing it. He may have his doubts, at the time of acting, without the means of &s;olving them. His ignorance does not alter the nature of the action in it&s;elf; though it mitigates the guilt in him. Such &s;ins indeed, one would hope, are &s;mall of|fences in the eyes of a merciful God: &mdash;and yet St. Paul heavily bewails his having per&s;ecuted the church of Chri&s;t, notwith&s;tanding he did it ignorantly.
<PB N="149" REF="146">
But St. Paul had few &s;ins to repent of, but tho&s;e of ignorance.</P>
<P>Sins of negligence are more involved in guilt. Not to u&s;e the opportunities we have, argues great coolne&s;s in religi|on; and great inattention to our duty. &mdash;And on this head we &s;hould be much upon our guard: for many &s;ins, which may perhaps appear to be tho&s;e of igno|rance only, may in fact be charged upon our own negligence, and want of atten|tion to tho&s;e means of knowing better, which God hath afforded us.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e we may rank &s;ins of &s;urprize; into which we are commonly betrayed by &s;ome &s;udden temptation. Sins of this kind &s;hould be &s;incerely re|pented of, and manfully with&s;tood.&mdash;If through our indulgence we &s;uffer them to get ground upon us, they are no lon|ger
<PB N="150" REF="147">
&s;ins of &s;urprize: they change their name; and mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed under the head of habitual &s;ins.</P>
<P>Habitual &s;ins are &s;tained with a very high degree of guilt. When we thus become the &s;laves of vice, our minds are tainted, and the &s;en&s;e of religion is lo&s;t. Even &s;maller &s;ins, when their fibres are thus woven into our nature, attain enormous growth. Of this al&s;o we may be a&s;&s;ured, that when we have thus lo&s;t the command of our&s;elves, we may proceed any length.&mdash;If a proper temptation ari&s;es, what is there to check us?&mdash;We may be carried to the la&s;t de|gree of wickedne&s;s; to which the &s;crip|tures give the name of pre&s;umptuous &s;ins.</P>
<P>By pre&s;umptuous &s;ins are meant tho&s;e black crimes; which have no want of
<PB N="151" REF="148">
knowledge to excu&s;e&mdash;no &s;udden temp|tation to extenuate; but are acted with deliberate contrivance; in open defiance of law, con&s;cience, and religion; and attended with all tho&s;e horrid circum|&s;tances, which &s;hew the la&s;t depravity of human nature.</P>
<P>From the guilt of every kind of &s;in let us guard with all our care. In pre|&s;umptuous &s;ins none of us, I &s;hould hope, can well be involved. The mind yet unhardened, &s;tarts with horror at &s;uch black tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Let us then always endeavour to keep alive this quick &s;en&s;ibility; and pre&s;erve our&s;elves at lea&s;t from habitual &s;ins: for the&s;e are what fir&s;t corrupt us. If we are not intangled in the&s;e, we may hope, that all our &s;ins of negligence and &s;urprize, if we guard again&s;t them as well as hu|man frailty will permit, may find for|givene&s;s

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="155" REF="151">WE believe farther "in the re&s;ur|rection of the body."&mdash;This article pre&s;umes our belief in the im|mortality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>What that principle of life is, which we call the &s;oul; how it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from mere animal life; how it is con|nected with the body; and in what &s;tate it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, when its bodily functions cea&s;e; are among tho&s;e indi&s;&s;oluble que&s;tions, with which nature every where abounds. But notwith&s;tanding the dif|ficulties, which attend the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e que&s;tions, the truth it&s;elf hath in all ages of the world been the popular creed. Men believed their &s;ouls were immortal from their own feelings, &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with an expectation of immor|tality&mdash;from ob&s;erving the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of the &s;oul, capable, even after the
<PB N="156" REF="152">
body had attained its full &s;trength, of &s;till higher improvements both in know|ledge, and in habits of virtue&mdash;from the analogy of all nature, dying and re|viving in every part&mdash;from their &s;ituati|on here &s;o apparently incomplete in it|&s;elf; and from a variety of other topics, which the rea&s;on of man was able to &s;ugge&s;t.&mdash;But though nature could ob|&s;curely &s;ugge&s;t this great truth; yet Chri&s;tianity alone threw a clear light upon it, and impre&s;&s;ed it with a full degree of conviction upon our minds.</P>
<P>But the article before us proceeds a &s;tep farther. It not only implies the immortality of the &s;oul; but a&s;&s;erts the re&s;urrection of the body.&mdash;Nor was this doctrine wholly new to nature. In its con|ceptions of a future life, we always find the &s;oul in an imbodied &s;tate. It was airy indeed and bloodle&s;s; but &s;till it
<PB N="157" REF="153">
had the parts of a human body, and could perform all its operations.</P>
<P>In the&s;e particulars the &s;cripture does not gratify our curio&s;ity. From various pa&s;&s;ages we are led to believe, that the body &s;hall certainly ri&s;e again: but in what manner, or of what &s;ub&s;tance, we pretend not to examine. We learn "that it is &s;own in corruption, and rai&s;ed in incorruption, that it is &s;own in di&s;honour, and rai&s;ed in glory; that it is &s;own a natural body, and rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body:" from all which we ga|ther, that whatever &s;amene&s;s our bodies may have, they will hereafter take a more &s;piritualized nature; and will not be &s;ubject to tho&s;e infirmities, to which they were &s;ubject on earth. Farther on this head, it behoves us not to inquire.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="154">In&s;tead, therefore, of entering into any metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions of iden|tity, or any other curious points, in which this deep &s;ubject might engage us, all which, as they are founded up|on uncertainty, mu&s;t end in doubt, it is better to draw this doctrine, as well as all others, into practical u&s;e: and the u&s;e we ought to make of it is, to pay that regard to our bodies, which is due to them&mdash;not vainly to adorn&mdash;not luxuriou&s;ly to pamper them; but to keep them as much as po&s;&s;ible from the pollu|tions of the world; and to lay them down in the grave undefiled, there to be &s;ealed up in expectation of a ble&s;&s;ed re&s;ur|rection.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we believe "in the life ever|la&s;ting;" in which article we expre&s;s our faith in the eternity of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="155">This article is nearly related to the la&s;t, and is involved in the &s;ame ob&s;cu|rity. In what the reward of the virtu|ous will con&s;i&s;t, after death, our rea&s;on gives us no information. Conjecture indeed it will, in a matter which &s;o nearly concerns us; and it hath conjec|tured in all ages: but information it hath none, except from the word of God; and even there, our limited ca|pacities can receive it only in general and figurative expre&s;&s;ions. We are told, "there will then reign fulne&s;s of joy, and plea&s;ures for evermore&mdash;that the righteous &s;hall have an inheritance in|corruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away&mdash;where they &s;hall &s;hine forth, as the &s;un, in the pre&s;ence of their father&mdash; where error, and &s;in, and mi&s;ery &s;hall be no more&mdash;where &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled an innumerable company of angels, the general a&s;&s;embly of the church, the &s;pi|rits
<PB N="160" REF="156">
of ju&s;t men made perfect&mdash;that they &s;hall neither hunger, nor thir&s;t any more&mdash;that all tears &s;hall be wiped from their eyes&mdash;that there &s;hall be neither death, nor &s;orrow, nor pain."</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, though we cannot collect the en|tire nature of a future &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s, yet we can ea&s;ily gather a few cir|cum&s;tances, which mu&s;t of cour&s;e at|tend it; as, that it will be very great&mdash; that it will la&s;t for ever&mdash;that it will be of a nature entirely different from the happine&s;s of this world&mdash;that, as in this world, our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites pre|vail; in the next, rea&s;on and virtue will have the &s;uperiority &mdash; "hunger and thir&s;t, tears and &s;orrow," we read, "will be no more"&mdash;that is, all unea&s;y pa&s;|&s;ions and appetites will then be annihi|lated&mdash;all vain fears will be then re|moved
<PB N="161" REF="157">
&mdash;all anxious and intruding cares &mdash;and we &s;hall feel our&s;elves compleat and perfect; and our happine&s;s, not de|pendent, as here, upon a thou&s;and pre|carious circum&s;tances, both within and without our&s;elves, but con&s;i&s;tent, uni|form, and &s;table.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we pretend not to inquire in what the puni&s;hment of the wicked con&s;i&s;ts. In the &s;cripture we find many expre&s;&s;ions, from which we gather, that it will be very great. It is there called, "an everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels&mdash; where the worm dieth not, and the fire is never quenched&mdash;where &s;hall be weep|ing, and gna&s;hing of teeth&mdash;where the wicked &s;hall drink of the wrath of God, poured without mixture, into the cup of his indignation&mdash;where they &s;hall have no re&s;t, neither by day nor night."</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="158">Though it becomes us certainly to put our interpretations with the greate&s;t caution and humility upon &s;uch pa&s;&s;a|ges as the&s;e; yet "the worm that ne|ver dieth," and "the fire that is never quenched," are &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, and hardly to be evaded by any refinements of verbal critici&s;m. Let the dei&s;t brave|ly argue down his fears, by demon|&s;trating the ab&s;urdity of con&s;uming a &s;pirit in material fire. Let him fully explain the nature of future puni&s;h|ment; and convince us, that where it cannot reform, it mu&s;t be unju&s;t.&mdash;But let us, with more mode&s;ty, lay our hands humbly upon our brea&s;ts, confe&s;s our ignorance; revere the appointments of God, whatever they may be; and prepare to meet them with holy hope, and trembling joy, and awful &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to his righteous will.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="159">To the unenlightened heathen the eternity of future puni&s;hments ap|peared no &s;uch unrea&s;onable doctrine. Their &s;tate of the damned was of eter|nal duration. A vulture for ever tore tho&s;e entrails, which were for ever re|newed.

<P>Of one thing, however, we may be well a&s;&s;ured, (which may &s;et us entirely at re&s;t in all our enquiries on this deep &s;ubject,) that every thing will, in the end, be right&mdash;that a ju&s;t and merciful God mu&s;t act agreeably to ju&s;tice and mercy&mdash;and that the fir&s;t of the&s;e at|tributes

will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be tempered with the latter.</P>
<P>From the doctrine of future rewards and puni&s;hments, the great and mo&s;t convincing practical truth which ari&s;es, is, that we cannot exert too much pains in qualifying our&s;elves for the happine&s;s of a future world. As this happine&s;s will la&s;t for ever, how beneficial will be the exchange&mdash;this world, "which is but for a moment, for that everla&s;ting weight of glory, which fadeth not away."</P>

<P>The ten commandments&mdash;not a com|pleat rule of duty&mdash;divi&s;ion of them, and &s;hort commentary upon them&mdash; our duty to God&mdash;belief&mdash;fear&mdash;love &mdash;objections to the goodne&s;s of God &mdash;mea&s;ures of the love of God.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="167" REF="162">HAVING con&s;idered the articles of our faith, we proceed to the rules of our practice. The&s;e, we know, are of &s;uch importance, that, let our faith be what it will, unle&s;s it influence our lives, it is of no value. At the &s;ame time, if it be what it ought to be, it will certainly have this influence.</P>
<P>On this head, the ten commandments are fir&s;t placed before us; from which the compo&s;ers of the catechi&s;m, as well as many other divines, have drawn a com|pleat &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tian duties. But this is perhaps rather too much. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>In the fourth volume of bi&s;hop Warburton's com|mentary on Pope's works, in the &s;econd &s;atyr of Dr. Donne, are the&s;e lines:</HI>

A ju&s;t ridicule on tho&s;e practical commentators, as they are called, who include all moral and religious duties within them.</Q></P>
<PB N="167" REF="162"></NOTE> Both
<PB N="168" REF="163">
Mo&s;es, in the law, and Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel, &s;eem to have inlarged greatly on morals: and each of them, e&s;pecial|ly the latter, to have added many prac|tical rules, which do not obviou&s;ly fall under any of the commandments.</P>
<P>But though we cannot call the deca|logue a compleat rule of duty, we ac|cept it with the utmo&s;t reverence, as the fir&s;t great written law that ever God communicated to man. We con&s;ider it as an eternal monument, in&s;cribed by
<PB N="169" REF="164">
the finger of God him&s;elf, with a few &s;trong, indelible characters; not defin|ing the minutiae of morals; but injoin|ing tho&s;e great duties only, which have the mo&s;t particular influence upon the happine&s;s of &s;ociety; and prohibiting tho&s;e enormous crimes, which are the greate&s;t &s;ources of its di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The ten commandments are divided into two parts, from their being origi|nally written upon two tables. From hence one table is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain our duty to God; the other, our duty to man. But this &s;eems to be an un|authorized divi&s;ion; and hath a tenden|cy to a verbal mi&s;take; as if &s;ome du|ties were owing to God; and others to man: whereas in fact we know that all duties are equally owing to God.&mdash;How|ever, if we avoid this mi&s;conception, the divi&s;ion into our duty to God, and
<PB N="170" REF="165">
our duty to man, may be a convenient one.&mdash;The four fir&s;t commandments are contained in the fir&s;t table: the remain|ing &s;ix in the &s;econd.</P>
<P>At the head of them &s;tands a prohi|bition to acknowledge more than one God.</P>
<P>The &s;econd commandment bears a near relation to the fir&s;t. The former forbids polythei&s;m; the latter idola|try: and with this belief, and prac|tice, which generally accompanied each other, all the nations of the earth were tainted, when the&s;e commandments were given: e&s;pecially tho&s;e nations, by whom the Jews were &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>The third commandment injoins re|verence to God's name. This is a &s;trong religious re&s;traint in private life;
<PB N="171" REF="166">
and as a &s;olemn oath is the &s;tricte&s;t ob|ligation among men, nothing can be of greater &s;ervice to &s;ociety, than to hold it in general re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The fourth commands the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath; as one of the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving a &s;en&s;e of God, and of re|ligion in the minds of men.</P>
<P>The &s;econd table begins with injoin|ing obedience to parents; a duty in a peculiar manner adapted to the jewi&s;h &s;tate, before any regular government was erected. The temporal promi&s;e, which guards it, and which can relate only to the jews, may either mean a promi&s;e of long life to each individual, who ob&s;erved the precept: or, of &s;ta|bility to the whole nation upon the ge|neral ob&s;ervance of it: which is per|haps a better interpretation.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="167">The five next commandments are prohibitions of the mo&s;t capital crimes, which pollute the heart of man, and in|jure the peace of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them forbids murder, which is the greate&s;t injury that one man can do another; as of all crimes the damage in this is the mo&s;t irrepar|able.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh commandment forbids adultery. The black infidelity, and injury which accompany this crime; the confu&s;ion in families, which often &s;uc|ceeds it; and the general tendency it hath to de&s;troy all the dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s of &s;ociety, &s;tain it with a very high degree of guilt.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of our property is the object of the eighth commandment.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="168">The &s;ecurity of our characters, is the object of the ninth.</P>
<P>The tenth re&s;trains us not only from the actual commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in; but from tho&s;e bad inclinations, which give it birth.</P>
<P>After the commandments follows a commentary upon them, intitled, "our duty to God," and "our duty to our neighbour." the latter of which might more properly be intitled, "Our duty to our neighbour, and our&s;elves."&mdash; The&s;e &s;eem intended as an explanation of the commandments upon Chri&s;tian principles; with the addition of other duties, which do not properly fall un|der any of them. On the&s;e we &s;hall be more large.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="169">The fir&s;t part of our duty to God, is, "to believe in him;" which is the foundation of all religion, and there|fore offers it&s;elf fir&s;t to our con&s;iderati|on. But this great point hath been al|ready con&s;idered. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See page</HI> 93.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next branch of our duty to God, is to fear him. The fear of God is impre&s;&s;ed equally upon the righteous man, and the &s;inner. But the fear of the &s;inner con&s;i&s;ts only in the dread of puni&s;hment. It is the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of guilt; and is not that fear, which we con&s;ider as a duty. The fear of God here meant, con&s;i&s;ts in that re|verential awe, that con&s;tant apprehen|&s;ion of his pre&s;ence, which &s;ecures us from offending him.&mdash;When we are be|fore our &s;uperiors, we naturally feel a re&s;pect, which prevents our doing any

If a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence hath &s;uch an influ|ence over us, as to check the bad ten|dency of our thoughts, words, and ac|tions; we may properly be &s;aid to be impre&s;&s;ed with the fear of God.&mdash;If not, we neglect one of the be&s;t means of checking vice, which the whole circle of religious re&s;traint affords.</P>
<P>Some people go a &s;tep farther; and &s;ay, that as every degree of light beha|viour, though &s;hort of an indecency, is improper before our &s;uperiors; &s;o is it likewi&s;e in the pre&s;ence of almighty God, who is &s;o much &s;uperior to every thing, that can be called great on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="171">But this is the language of &s;uper&s;ti|tion. Mirth, within the bounds of in|nocence, cannot be offen&s;ive to God. He is offended only with vice. Vice, in the lowe&s;t degree, is hateful to him: but a formal, &s;et behaviour, can be ne|ce&s;&s;ary only to pre&s;erve human di&s;tinc|tions.</P>
<P>The next duty to God is that of love, which is founded upon his good|ne&s;s to his creatures. Even this world, mixed as it is with evil, exhibits various marks of the goodne&s;s of the Deity. Mo&s;t men indeed place their affections too much upon it, and rate it at too high a value: but in the opinion even of wi&s;e men, it de&s;erves &s;ome e&s;tima|tion. The acqui&s;ition of knowledge, in all its branches; the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety; the contemplation of the won|derful works of God, and all the beau|teous
<PB N="177" REF="172">
&s;cenes of nature; nay, even the low inclnations of animal life, when indulg|ed with &s;obriety and moderation, fur|ni&s;h various modes of plea&s;ure and en|joyment.</P>
<P>Let this world however go for little. In contemplating a future life, the en|joyments of this are lo&s;t. It is in the contemplation of futurity, that the chri&s;tian views the goodne&s;s of God in the fulle&s;t light. When he &s;ees the Deity engaging him&s;elf by covenant to make our &s;hort abode here a prepara|tion for our eternal happine&s;s hereafter &mdash;when he is a&s;&s;ured, that this happi|ne&s;s is not only eternal, but of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t perfect kind&mdash;when he &s;ees God, as a father, opening all his &s;tores of love and kindne&s;s, to bring back to him&s;elf a race of creatures fal|len from their original perfection, and
<PB N="178" REF="173">
totally lo&s;t through their own folly, perver&s;ene&s;s, and wickedne&s;s; then it is that the evils of life &s;eem as atoms in the &s;un-beam; the divine nature ap|pears overflowing with goodne&s;s to man|kind, and calls forth every exertion of our gratitude and love.</P>
<P>That the enjoyments of a future &s;tate, in whatever tho&s;e enjoyments con&s;i&s;t, are the gift of God, is &s;ufficiently ob|vious: but with regard to the govern|ment of this world, there is often among men a &s;ort of infidelity, which a&s;cribes all events to their own prudence and in|du&s;try. Things appear to run in a &s;tated cour&s;e; and the finger of God, which acts un&s;een, is never &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And, no doubt, our own indu&s;try and prudence have a great &s;hare in pro|curing for us the ble&s;&s;ings of life. God
<PB N="179" REF="174">
hath annexed them as the reward of &s;uch exertions. But can we &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch exertions will be of any &s;ervice to us, unle&s;s the providence of God throw opportunities in our way? All the means of worldly happine&s;s are &s;urely no other than the means of his government. Mo&s;es &s;aw among the jews a kind of infidelity like this, when he forbad the people to &s;ay in their hearts, "My power, and the might of my hands hath gotten me this wealth:" whereas, he adds, they ought to remem|ber, "That it is the Lord who giveth power to get wealth."</P>
<P>Others again have objected to the goodne&s;s of God, his permi&s;&s;ion of evil. A good God, &s;ay they, would have prevented it; and have placed his creatures in a &s;ituation beyond the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of life.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="175">With regard to man, there &s;eems to be no great difficulty in this matter. It is enough, &s;urely, that God has put the means of comfort in our power.

<P>The mi&s;ery of the brute creation is indeed more unaccountable. But have we not the mode&s;ty to &s;uppo&s;e, that this difficulty may be owing to our igno|rance? And that on the &s;trength of what we know of the wi&s;dom of God,
<PB N="181" REF="176">
we may venture to tru&s;t him for tho&s;e parts which we cannot comprehend?</P>
<P>One truth, after all, is very apparent, that if we &s;hould argue our&s;elves into athei&s;m by the untractablene&s;s of the&s;e &s;ubjects, we &s;hould be &s;o far from get|ting rid of our difficulties, that, if we rea&s;on ju&s;tly, ten thou&s;and greater would ari&s;e, either from con&s;idering the world under no ruler, or under one of our own imagining.</P>
<P>There remains one farther con&s;idera|tion with regard to the love of God, and that is, the mea&s;ure of it. We are told we ought to love him "with all our heart, with all our &s;oul, and with all our &s;trength." The&s;e are &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and &s;eem to imply a greater warmth of affection, than many people may perhaps find they can exert. The

affections of &s;ome are naturally cool, and little excited by any objects. The guilty per&s;on is he, who&s;e affections are warm in every thing but religion.&mdash;The obvious meaning therefore of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is, that whether our affections are cool or warm, we &s;hould make God our chief good&mdash;that we &s;hould &s;et our affections more upon him, than upon any thing el&s;e&mdash;and that, for his &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of his laws, we &s;hould be ready to re&s;ign every thing we have, and even life it&s;elf. So that the words &s;eem nearly of the &s;ame import with tho&s;e of the apo&s;tle, "Set your affec|tions on things above, and not on things on the earth."</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="185" REF="179">OUR next duty to God, is, to wor|&s;hip him, to give him thanks, to put our whole tru&s;t in him, and to call upon him.</P>
<P>We have here the duty of prayer re|commended to us: but I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion, in treating of the Lord's prayer, to &s;peak more fully hereafter on this &s;ubject. What I &s;hall &s;ay at pre&s;ent, &s;hall be confined to the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>The jewi&s;h &s;abbath was in&s;tituted to commemorate the creation of the world, and the redemption from Egypt. The&s;e great events, which it held out, im|pre&s;&s;ed upon the people a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of God's power; their dependence up|on him; and the propriety of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="180">The great event held out by the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, is the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. And for this rea&s;on the chri&s;|tian hath changed his &s;abbath from the &s;eventh day of the week to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>There is another di&s;tinction between the jewi&s;h and the chri&s;tian &s;abbath. The former was ob&s;erved with that cere|monial &s;trictne&s;s which ran through the whole jewi&s;h law. The more liberal &s;pirit of the go&s;pel hath freed the chri&s;|tian &s;abbath from the&s;e ob&s;ervances; and retains only its moral ends, public wor&s;hip, and in&s;truction. By the&s;e ends therefore our &s;abbath is regulated; and nothing profanes it, but what oppo&s;es them.&mdash;On the head of public wor&s;hip much might be &s;aid.</P>
<P>It is a te&s;timony of that reverence which is due to the &s;upreme being.
<PB N="187" REF="181">
The general &s;en&s;e of mankind con&s;iders it as &s;uch. The heathen nations al|ways approached their gods in public a&s;&s;emblies. The re&s;pect of a public re&s;ort, on &s;olemn occa&s;ions, is paid even to earthly princes.&mdash;If it tends there|fore in any degree to impre&s;s an idea of reverence, it is certainly due on all oc|ca&s;ions, where the Almighty is con|cerned.</P>
<P>An attendance al&s;o on the public &s;er|vice of the church is giving a public te&s;timony of our faith. It is that te&s;t, which &s;ociety demands of all its mem|bers. By the laws of the community it is exacted; and it tends undoubt|edly to create a confidence among men.</P>
<P>The&s;e public a&s;&s;emblies are al&s;o a kind of connecting bond among chri&s;|tians. Every part of the &s;ervice points
<PB N="188" REF="182">
out that love, and union, which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t among them. It places them in the light of children of one common parent; joining, with one con&s;ent, in begging ble&s;&s;ings, which concern them all.</P>
<P>Public wor&s;hip al&s;o is particularly accommodated to deprecate national ca|lamities, and implore national ble&s;&s;ings; as clo&s;et devotion is more the vehicle of our private reque&s;ts. It is common|ly al&s;o e&s;teemed the mo&s;t animated &s;pe|cies of devotion, as the zeal of one may be &s;uppo&s;ed to excite the zeal of ano|ther.&mdash;In the generality indeed of our cold, unanimated a&s;&s;emblies, little of this is &s;een: but if we were pre|&s;ent at an a&s;&s;embly, where every mem|ber was really in earne&s;t, we mu&s;t be much unacquainted with the &s;pirit of
<PB N="189" REF="183">
devotion, if we did not, in &s;ome de|gree, catch the flame.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o particularly remember, that great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon this &s;pecies of devotion in &s;cripture; where we read frequently of a&s;&s;emblies meeting to prai&s;e God on the fir&s;t day of the week. &mdash;Nor is it perhaps unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that public devotion draws God's favour, in a peculiar manner, upon our prayers. "Where two or three are ga|thered together," &s;ays Chri&s;t, "there am I in the mid&s;t of them."</P>
<P>Secondly, the &s;abbath is the great mean of in&s;truction. If people of edu|cation in this inlightened age, think in|&s;truction of le&s;s con&s;equence to them, yet at lea&s;t they mu&s;t think it of great u&s;e to the vulgar. It is a common opi|nion, and the better for being &s;o, that
<PB N="190" REF="184">
were it not for the &s;abbath, religion it|&s;elf would be lo&s;t. And if people of &s;uperior &s;tations do not give the ob&s;erv|ance of it their &s;anction, it will not long have credit among the vulgar.</P>
<P>Since therefore the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath is founded upon &s;o many wi&s;e and ju&s;t rea&s;ons, what have they to an|&s;wer for, who not only neglect this in|&s;titution them&s;elves, but bring it by their example into contempt with o|thers? I &s;peak not to tho&s;e who make it a day of common diver&s;ion; who, laying a&s;ide all decency, and breaking through all civil and religious regula|tions, &s;pend it in the mo&s;t licentious a|mu&s;ements: &s;uch people are pa&s;t all re|proof: but I &s;peak to tho&s;e, who in other things profe&s;s them&s;elves to be &s;erious people; and, one might hope, would act
<PB N="191" REF="185">
right, when they were convinced what was &s;o.</P>
<P>But our prayers, whether in public, or in private, are only an idle parade, unle&s;s we put our tru&s;t in God.</P>
<P>By putting our tru&s;t in God, is meant depending upon him, as our happine&s;s, and our refuge.</P>
<P>Human nature is always endeavour|ing either to remove pain; or, if ea&s;e be obtained, to acquire happine&s;s. And tho&s;e things are certainly the mo&s;t eli|gible, which in the&s;e re&s;pects are the mo&s;t effectual. The world, it is true, makes us flattering promi&s;es: but who can &s;ay that it will keep them? We con|&s;i&s;t of two parts, a body, and a &s;oul. Both of the&s;e want the means of hap|pine&s;s, as well as the removal of evil.
<PB N="192" REF="186">
But the world cannot even afford them to the body. Its means of happine&s;s, to tho&s;e who depend upon them as &s;uch, are, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, un&s;atisfy|ing. Even, at be&s;t, they will fail us in in the end. While pain, di&s;ea&s;es, and death, &s;hew us, that the world can af|ford no refuge again&s;t bodily di&s;tre&s;s. And if it cannot afford the means of happine&s;s, and of &s;ecurity, to the body, how much le&s;s can we &s;uppo&s;e it able to afford them to the &s;oul?</P>
<P>Nothing then, we &s;ee, in this world, is a &s;ufficient foundation for tru&s;t: nor indeed can any thing be, but almighty God, who affords us the only means of happine&s;s, and is our only real refuge in di&s;tre&s;s. On him, the more we tru&s;t, the greater we &s;hall feel our &s;ecurity; and that man who has, on ju&s;t religious motives, confirmed in him&s;elf this tru&s;t,
<PB N="193" REF="187">
wants nothing el&s;e to &s;ecure his happi|ne&s;s. The world may wear what a&s;pect it will: it is not on it that he depends. As far as prudence goes, he endeavours to avoid the evils of life: but when they fall to his &s;hare (as &s;ooner or later we mu&s;t all &s;hare them) he re&s;igns him&s;elf into the hands of that God who made him, and who knows be&s;t how to di&s;po&s;e of him. On him he thorough|ly depends, and with him he has a con&s;tant intercour&s;e by prayer; tru&s;t|ing, that whatever happens is agreeable to that ju&s;t government, which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed; and that, of con&s;equence, it mu&s;t be be&s;t.</P>
<P>We are injoined next "to honour God's holy name."</P>
<P>The name of God is accompanied with &s;uch ideas of greatne&s;s and reve|rence,
<PB N="194" REF="188">
that it &s;hould never pa&s;s our lips without &s;ugge&s;ting tho&s;e ideas. Indeed it &s;hould never be mentioned, but with a kind of awful he&s;itation, and on the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ions; either in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, or, when we invoke God in prayer, or when we &s;wear by his name.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t light we are here particu|larly injoined to honour the name of God. A &s;olemn oath is an appeal to God him&s;elf; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The poets rule in the drama, is exactly what ought to be the Chri&s;tian's in the u&s;e of oaths:</HI>
<Q><L>Nec Deus interfit, ni&s;i dignus vindice nodus</L>
<L>Inciderit.</L></Q></P></NOTE> and is intitled to our utmo&s;t re&s;pect, were it only in a political light; as in all human concerns it is the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;t of veracity; and has been approved as &s;uch by the wi&s;dom of all nations.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="189">Some religioni&s;ts have di&s;approved the u&s;e of oaths, under the idea of pro|phanene&s;s. The language of the &s;acred writers conveys a different idea. One of them &s;ays, "An oath for confirma|tion is an end of all &s;trife:" another, "I take God for record upon my &s;oul:" and a third, "God is my witne&s;s."</P>
<P>To the u&s;e of oaths others have ob|jected, that they are nugatory. The good man will &s;peak the truth without an oath; and the bad man, cannot be held by one. And this would be true, if mankind were divided into good and bad: but as they are generally of a mixed character, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that many would venture a &s;imple fal&s;|hood; who would yet be &s;tartled at the idea of perjury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>They who attend our courts of ju&s;tice, often &s;ee in|&s;tances among the common people of their a&s;&s;erting round|ly
<PB N="196" REF="190">what they will either refu&s;e to &s;wear; or when &s;worn, will not a&s;&s;ert.</HI></P>
<PB N="195" REF="189"></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="190">As an oath therefore taken in a &s;o|lemn manner, and on a proper occa&s;ion, may be con&s;idered as one of the highe&s;t acts of religion; &s;o perjury, or fal&s;e &s;wearing, is certainly one of the highe&s;t acts of impiety; and the greate&s;t di&s;|honour we can po&s;&s;ibly &s;hew to the name of God. It is, in effect, either denying our belief in a God, or his power to pu|ni&s;h. Other crimes wi&s;h to e&s;cape the notice of heaven: this is daring the Al|mighty to his face.</P>
<P>After perjury, the name of God is mo&s;t di&s;honoured by the horrid practice of cur&s;ing. Its effects in &s;ociety it is true, are not &s;o mi&s;chievous as tho&s;e of perjury; nor is it &s;o deliberate an act;
<PB N="197" REF="191">
but yet it conveys a &s;till more horrid idea. Indeed if there be one wicked practice more peculiarly diabolical, than another; it is this: for no employment can be conceived more &s;uitable to infernal &s;pirits, than that of &s;pending their rage and impotence in cur&s;es, and execrati|ons. If this &s;hocking vice were not &s;o dreadfully familiar to our ears, it could not fail to &s;trike us with the utmo&s;t hor|ror.</P>
<P>We next con&s;ider common &s;wearing; a &s;in &s;o univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, that one would imagine &s;ome great advantage, in the way either of plea&s;ure or profit, attended it. The wages of iniquity af|ford &s;ome temptation: but to commit &s;in without any wages, is a &s;trange &s;pe|cies of infatuation&mdash;May we then a&s;k the common &s;wearer, what the advan|tages are, which ari&s;e from this prac|tice?</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="192">It will be difficult to point out one. &mdash;Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that it adds &s;trength to an affirmation. But if a man commonly &s;trengthen his affirmations in this way, we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the practice will tend rather to le&s;&s;en, than confirm, his credit. It &s;hews plain|ly what he him&s;elf thinks of his own ve|racity. We never prop a building, till it becomes ruinous.</P>
<P>Some forward youth may think, that an oath adds an air and &s;pirit to his di&s;|cour&s;e; that it is manly and important; and gives him con&s;equence. We may whi&s;per one &s;ecret in his ear, which he may be a&s;&s;ured is a truth&mdash;The&s;e airs of manline&s;s give him con&s;equence with tho&s;e only, who&s;e commendation is di&s;|grace: others he only convinces, at how early an age he wi&s;hes to be thought profligate.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="193">Perhaps he may imagine, that an oath gives force, and terror to his threat|nings.&mdash; In this he may be right; and the more horribly wicked he grows, the greater object of terror he may make him&s;elf. On this plan, the devil af|fords him a complete pattern for imita|tion.</P>
<P>Paltry as the&s;e apologies are, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, the practice of common &s;wear|ing has little more to &s;ay for it&s;elf.&mdash; Tho&s;e however, who can argue in fa|vour of this &s;in, I &s;hould fear, there is little chance to reclaim.&mdash;But it is pro|bable, that the greater part of &s;uch as are addicted to it, act rather from habit, than principle. To deter &s;uch per&s;ons from indulging &s;o pernicious a habit, and to &s;hew them, that it is worth their while to be at &s;ome pains to conquer it,
<PB N="200" REF="194">
let us now &s;ee what arguments may be produced on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, common &s;wearing leads to perjury. He who is addicted to &s;wear on every trifling occa&s;ion, cannot but often, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, unavoidably, give the &s;anction of an oath to an un|truth. And though I &s;hould hope &s;uch perjury is not a &s;in of &s;o heinous a na|ture, as what, in judicial matters, is called wilful, and corrupt; yet it is certainly &s;tained with a very great de|gree of guilt.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, common &s;wearing is a large &s;tride towards wilful and corrupt perjury; in as much as it makes a &s;olemn oath to be received with le&s;s reverence. If nobody dared to take an oath, but on proper occa&s;ions, an oath would be re|ceived
<PB N="201" REF="195">
with re&s;pect: but when we are accu&s;tomed to hear &s;wearing the common language of our &s;treets, it is no wonder, that people make light of oaths on every occa&s;ion; and that judicial, commerci|al, qualifying, and official oaths, are all treated with &s;o much indifference.</P>
<P>Thirdly, common &s;wearing may be con&s;idered as an act of great irreverence to God; and as &s;uch, implying al&s;o a great indifference to religion. If it would di&s;grace a chief magi&s;trate to &s;uf|fer appeals on every trifling, or ludi|crous occa&s;ion; we may at lea&s;t think it as di&s;re&s;pectful to the Almighty.&mdash;If we lo&s;e our reverence for God, it is im|po&s;&s;ible we can retain it for his laws. You &s;carce remember a common &s;wear|er, who was in other re&s;pects an exact chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="196">But above all, we &s;hould be deterred from common &s;wearing by the po&s;itive command of our Saviour, which is founded unque&s;tionably upon the wick|edne&s;s of the practice: "You have heard," &s;aith Chri&s;t, "that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf: but I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, neither by the earth for it is his foot&s;tool: but let your communication" (that is, your ordinary conver&s;ation) "be yea, yea, nay, nay; for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e cometh of evil."&mdash;St James al&s;o, with great empha&s;is pre&s;&s;ing his ma&s;ter's words, &s;ays, "Above all things, my brethren, &s;wear not; neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay, le&s;t you fall into condemnation.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="197">I &s;hall ju&s;t add, before I conclude this &s;ubject, that two things are to be avoided, which are very nearly allied to &s;wearing.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, the u&s;e of light exclama|tions, and invocations upon God, on every trivial occa&s;ion. We cannot have much reverence for God him&s;elf, when we treat his name in &s;o familiar a man|ner; and may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that we are indulging a practice, which mu&s;t weaken impre&s;&s;ions, that ought to be pre&s;erved as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Secondly, &s;uch light expre&s;&s;ions, and wanton phra&s;es, as &s;ound like &s;wearing are to be avoided; and are often therefore indulged by &s;illy peo|ple, for the &s;ake of the &s;ound; who think (if they think at all) that they add to their di&s;cour&s;e the &s;pirit of &s;wear|ing

<HEAD>LECTURE XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Honour due to God's word&mdash;books of &s;cripture&mdash;patriarchal hi&s;tory&mdash;jewi&s;h hi&s;tory&mdash;prophetic writings&mdash;poeti|cal, and moral&mdash;new te&s;tament&mdash;hi&s;|tory of Chri&s;t, and the early age of the church&mdash;epi&s;tles, and revelations &mdash;u&s;e and application of &s;cripture&mdash; what it is to &s;erve God truly&mdash;what it is to &s;erve him all the days of our life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="207" REF="200">AS we are injoined to honour God's holy name, &s;o are we injoined al&s;o "to honour his holy word."</P>
<P>By God's holy word we mean both the old te&s;tament and the new. The con|nection between them is &s;o clo&s;e, that no man can pay a regard to the one, without paying it al&s;o to the other. The new te&s;tament is not only of the &s;ame texture with the old; but the very &s;ame web, as it were, only more unfolded.</P>
<P>The books of the old te&s;tament open with the earlie&s;t accounts of time, ear|lier than any human records reach; and yet, in many in&s;tances, they are &s;trength|ened by human records. The heathen mythology is often grounded upon rem|nants of the &s;acred &s;tory; and many of
<PB N="208" REF="201">
the bible-events are recorded, however imperfectly, in prophane hi&s;tory. The very face of nature bears witne&s;s to the deluge.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of the patriarchs is ex|hibited a mo&s;t beautiful picture of the &s;implicity of ancient manners; and of genuine nature, unadorned indeed by &s;cience, but impre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly with a &s;en&s;e of religion. This gives an air of greatne&s;s and dignity, to all the &s;enti|ments and actions of the&s;e exalted cha|racters.</P>
<P>The patriarchal hi&s;tory is followed by the jewi&s;h. Here we have the prin|cipal events of that peculiar nation; which lived under a theocracy, and was &s;et apart to pre&s;erve, and propagate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the &s;ubject very learnedly treated in one of the fir&s;t chapters of Jenkins's rea&s;onablene&s;s of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></NOTE> the
<PB N="209" REF="202">
knowledge of the true God through tho&s;e ages of ignorance, antecedent to Chri&s;t. Here too we find tho&s;e types, and repre&s;entations, which the apo&s;tle to the Hebrews calls the &s;hadows of good things to come.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e books, which contain the legi&s;lation, and hi&s;tory of the Jews, &s;uc|ceed the prophetic writings. As the time of the promi&s;e drew &s;till nearer, the notices of its approach became &s;tronger. The kingdom of the Me&s;|&s;iah, which was but ob&s;curely, &s;ha|dowed by the ceremonies of the Jewi&s;h law, was marked in &s;tronger lines by the prophets, and proclaimed in more intelligible language. The of|fice of the Me&s;&s;iah, his mini&s;try, his life, his actions, his death, and his re|&s;urrection, are all very di&s;tinctly held out. It is true, the Jews, explaining
<PB N="210" REF="203">
the warm figures of the prophetic lan|guage too literally, and applying to a temporal dominion tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, which were intended only as de&s;criptive of a &s;piritual, were offended at the meanne&s;s of Chri&s;t's appearance on earth; and would not own him for that Me&s;|&s;iah, whom their prophets had foretold; though the&s;e very prophets, when they u&s;ed a le&s;s figurative language, had de|&s;cribed him, as he really was, a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief.</P>
<P>To the&s;e books are added &s;everal others, poetical and moral, which ad|mini&s;ter much in&s;truction, and matter of meditation to devout minds.</P>
<P>The new te&s;tament contains fir&s;t the &s;imple hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t, as recorded in the four go&s;pels. In this hi&s;tory al&s;o are delivered tho&s;e excellent in&s;tructions,
<PB N="211" REF="204">
which our Saviour occa&s;ionally gave his di&s;ciples; the precepts and the example blended together.</P>
<P>To the go&s;pels &s;ucceeds an account of the lives and actions of &s;ome of the principal apo&s;tles; together with the early &s;tate of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tles of &s;everal of the Apo&s;tles, particularly of St. Paul, to &s;ome of the new e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, make another part. Our &s;aviour had promi&s;ed to en|dow his di&s;ciples with power from on high to complete the great work of publi&s;hing the go&s;pel: and in the epi&s;tles that work is completed. The truths and doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion are here &s;till more unfolded, and infor|ced: as the great &s;cheme of our re|demption, was now fini&s;hed by the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="205">The &s;acred volume is concluded with the revelations of St. John; which are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a prophetic de&s;crip|tion of the future &s;tate of the church. Some of the&s;e prophecies, it is thought on very good grounds, are already fulfil|led; and others, which now, as &s;ublime de&s;criptions only, amu&s;e the imaginati|on, will probably, in the future ages of the church, be the objects of the under|&s;tanding al&s;o.</P>
<P>Such is the word of God, which we are injoined to honour. And this ho|nour, we may be a&s;&s;ured, is be&s;t &s;hewn by applying the&s;e holy writings to the u&s;es for which God intended them. We &s;hould take the bible into our hands, as we &s;hould approach a divine in&s;tructor, with a habit of mind&mdash;not to cavil&mdash;not to create objections&mdash;not to quote wantonly&mdash;not to apply to ludi|crous
<PB N="213" REF="206">
purpo&s;es (all which is certainly di&s;honouring it) but with a pious incli|nation to improve our hearts, by learning from it the duties of chri&s;tianity&mdash;by learning from it, how to live, and how to die.</P>
<P>This divine book furni&s;hes a great va|riety of matter for our meditation. It is profitable, we are told, for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and in&s;truction. When we find in it moral rules laid down for our conduct, we &s;hould com|pare our actions with tho&s;e rules: and where motives are a&s;&s;igned, we &s;hould try our hearts by the&s;e too, and exa|mine, whether they are right in the &s;ight of God. When it in&s;tructs us to have our conver&s;ation in heaven, and to &s;et our affections on things above, we ought to examine our&s;elves, whether heaven, or the world is more the object
<PB N="214" REF="207">
of our de&s;ires. When the mercies of the go&s;pel are recited, they &s;hould rai&s;e our joy, our love, and thankfulne&s;s: and when we read the denunciations of God's wrath again&s;t &s;in, our minds &s;hould re|ceive with reverence the awful impre&s;&s;i|on. When the good actions of holy men are recorded, we &s;hould con&s;ider them as recorded for our example; and when their frailties are recited, the&s;e &s;hould teach us diffidence, and humili|ty. In &s;hort, our fears, our hopes, our faith, our joy, our love, and gratitude have all &s;ufficient objects to engage them. It &s;hould be our great endeavour to transfu&s;e the &s;pirit of this holy book into our lives; and he who can do this the be&s;t, may be a&s;&s;ured, that he ho|nours it the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The la&s;t part of our duty to God is,
<PB N="215" REF="208">
"to &s;erve him truly all the days of our life."</P>
<P>"To &s;erve God truly all the days of our life" implies two things: fir&s;t, the mode of this &s;ervice; and &s;econdly, the term of it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;erve God truly. We mu&s;t not re&s;t &s;atisfied with the out|ward action: but mu&s;t take care that every action be founded on a proper motive. It is the motive alone that makes an action acceptable to God. The hypocrite "may fa&s;t twice in the week, and give alms of all that he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es:" nay he may fa&s;t the whole week, if he be able; and give all he has in alms; but if his fa&s;ts, and his alms are intended as matter of o&s;tentation only, neither the one, nor the other, is that true &s;ervice which God requires. God
<PB N="216" REF="209">
requires the heart: He requires that an earne&s;t de&s;ire of acting agreeably to his will, &s;hould be the general &s;pring of our actions: and this will give even an indifferent action a value in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>As we are injoined to &s;erve God truly, &s;o are we injoined to &s;erve him "all the days of our life." As far as human frailties will permit, we &s;hould per&s;e|vere in a con&s;tant tenor of obedience. That lax behaviour, which in&s;tead of making a &s;teady progre&s;s, is continual|ly relap&s;ing into former errors, and run|ning the &s;ame round of &s;inning, and re|penting, is rather the life of an irre&s;o|lute &s;inner, than of a pious chri&s;tian. Human errors, and frailties, we know, God will not treat with too &s;evere an eye: but he who, in the general tenor of his life, does not keep advancing to|wards chri&s;tian perfection; but &s;uffers
<PB N="217" REF="210">
him&s;elf, at intervals, entirely to lo&s;e &s;ight of his calling, cannot be really &s;erious in his profe&s;&s;ion: he is at a great di&s;|tance from &s;erving God truly all the days of his life; and has no &s;criptural ground to hope much from the mercy of God.</P>
<P>That man, whether placed in high e&s;tate, or low, has reached the &s;ummit of human happine&s;s, who is truly &s;eri|ous in the &s;ervice of his great ma&s;ter. The things of this world may engage, but cannot engro&s;s, his attention: its &s;orrows, and its joys may affect, but cannot di&s;concert, him. No man, he knows, can faithfully &s;erve two ma&s;|ters. He hath hired him&s;elf to one&mdash; that great ma&s;ter, who&s;e commands he reveres, who&s;e favour he &s;eeks, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure alone is the real object of his fears; and who&s;e rewards alone are the
<PB N="218" REF="211">
real objects of his hope. Every thing el&s;e is, trivial in his &s;ight. The world may &s;ooth; or it may threaten him: he per&s;everes &s;teadily in the &s;ervice of his God; and in that per&s;everance feels his happine&s;s every day the more e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Duties to man divided into general and particular&mdash;general duties con&s;idered &mdash;loving our neighbour as our&s;elves &mdash;the phra&s;e explained&mdash;the nature of chri&s;tian benevolence&mdash;of private friend&s;hip, and love to our country &mdash;doing to others, as we would have them do to us&mdash;the rule properly guarded&mdash;the happine&s;s derived to in|dividuals, and &s;ociety from the ob|&s;ervance of the two rules, of loving our neighbour as our&s;elves; and doing to others, as we would have them do to us.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="221" REF="213">HAVING con&s;idered tho&s;e duties, which we owe immediately to God, we next con&s;ider tho&s;e, which have a more immediate connection with man. The&s;e, as di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;um|mary before us, may be divided into general, and particular duties&mdash;&s;uch as concern to mankind in general; and &s;uch as ari&s;e from particular relations.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider, fir&s;t, &s;uch as are ge|neral. "We mu&s;t love our neighbour as our&s;elves"&mdash;and, "Do to others, as we would have them do to us." The&s;e two rules may not improperly be called an appendix to the law. Upon every emergence a law in point may not be ready: it may not indeed exi&s;t. In many ca&s;es we mu&s;t be more at liberty. What law, for in&s;tance, can direct all
<PB N="222" REF="214">
tho&s;e little namele&s;s offices of friendly intercour&s;e between man and man, which pre&s;erve the peace of &s;ociety; and form the greate&s;t part of its hap|pine&s;s? What law again can direct our gratitude? or can enter into all tho&s;e minute di&s;tinctions, which make the circum&s;tances of one man different from tho&s;e of another? We are here therefore injoined to make appeals to our own feelings in many ca&s;es not taken notice of by law.&mdash;The former of the&s;e great rules regards our affections; the latter, our actions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, "we mu&s;t love our neighbour as our&s;elves." The meaning of the word neighbour, our Saviour &s;ettled in the parable of the good Samaritan; from which it appears, that all mankind are to be e&s;teemed our neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="215">The mode al&s;o of this affection is defined. "We mu&s;t love our neigh|bour, as our&s;elves." How then do we love our&s;elves? Self-love, we know, is a &s;teady principle, prompting us, at all times, to avoid pain, and pur&s;ue hap|pine&s;s. For though men are often the voluntary authors of their own mi|&s;ery; yet they act under a blind belief, that the pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, in a vicious action, may overbalance the pernicious con&s;equences. Their own happine&s;s is always intended.&mdash;If therefore the love we owe our neighbour, mu&s;t be mea&s;ur|ed by the love we bear our&s;elves, it mu&s;t be a &s;teady principle prompting us at all times to relieve his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and promote his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, that love is involuntary&mdash;that we like, and di&s;like from humour, prejudice, and caprice:
<PB N="224" REF="216">
how then is an affection, &s;o little in our power, pre&s;cribed as a duty?</P>
<P>This is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. A general, ab&s;tracted benevolence, which is ready to do good to all, and which delights in the good of all, may exi&s;t without any of that particular attachment to the in|dividual, which is u&s;ually called love: and this is the temper, which chri&s;tianity would encourage&mdash;an affection to the whole &s;pecies; and particularly a com|pa&s;&s;ion to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed part of it. The good Samaritan would have relieved any man in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, in which he found the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed traveller. To that man he had no particular attach|ment. He had never before &s;een him.</P>
<P>Here a que&s;tion may ari&s;e about pri|vate friend&s;hip, and love to our coun|try;
<PB N="225" REF="217">
on both which points the &s;cripture is &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It may be &s;o: it was our Saviour's de&s;ign to enlarge our affections, rather than contract them. He, who was &s;o well acquainted with human nature, certainly knew, that if univer&s;al bene|volence were attained, all the inferior degrees of affection to relations, friends, and country, would follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, religion &s;eems to have no more bu&s;ine&s;s to recommed friend&s;hip, or patrioti&s;m, than it has to recommend marriage, or celibacy; a country life, or a town-life. They are modes of af|fection, which circum&s;tances may make &s;uitable to one man, and un&s;uitable to another; and therefore cannot be of ge|neral moral obligation. One may con|ceive a man to change his abode &s;o fre|quently,
<PB N="226" REF="218">
and &s;o remotely, as to have neither country, nor friend.</P>
<P>The regulation of our affections leads naturally to the regulation of our acti|ons. "We mu&s;t do to others, as we would have them do to us."</P>
<P>Are we then to be the dupes of any extravagant claim, that may be made upon us?</P>
<P>By no means. This is a perver&s;ion of the rule. We are required only to do to others, what we could rea&s;onably expect they &s;hould do to us. Hence all unrea&s;onable claims are excluded. With this re&s;triction the rule before us is truly admirable; and &s;hould be ever in our minds, when we have intercour&s;e with others. Scarce any ca&s;e can occur, in which it will not direct us right.
<PB N="227" REF="219">
Our practice is not here confounded by nice di&s;tinctions, or &s;ubtil points of morality: we are referred at once to our own brea&s;ts. Our own feelings are the criterion. We have only to a&s;k our|&s;elves, whether the action in di&s;pute be &s;uch, as we &s;hould think might rea&s;on|ably be done to our&s;elves? An an&s;wer to this que&s;tion will &s;olve the mo&s;t dif|ficult ca&s;e between us, and our neigh|bour. And indeed if we attend &s;uffici|ently to this rule, we &s;hall &s;carce need any other.</P>
<P>From the exertion of univer&s;al bene|volence, inculcated in the&s;e two rules; every happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e, of which men are capable, either as individuals, or as members of &s;ociety. The fir&s;t, which regulates our affections, leads di|rectly to our own happine&s;s. If we love others, as we love our&s;elves, we mu&s;t of
<PB N="228" REF="220">
cour&s;e dive&s;t our minds of all tho&s;e vile affections, which are the great &s;ources of our mi&s;ery: and when envy, malice, revenge, and other bad inclinations are rooted out, the kind and friendly affec|tions will of cour&s;e take place: at lea&s;t, the ground is well prepared for their re|ception.</P>
<P>As the ob&s;ervance of the fir&s;t rule leads directly to our own happine&s;s; the ob&s;ervance of the &s;econd leads directly to the happine&s;s of others. The mi&s;|chiefs, which di&s;tre&s;s &s;ociety, ari&s;e chiefly from violence and fraud. Both the&s;e will be driven out, through the prevalence of this principle; for who would him&s;elf wi&s;h to be the object of either?</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="221">The &s;igns which accompany this di|vine temper, are a general obliging be|haviour in our ordinary conver&s;ation; and a gentlene&s;s of manners to all men, whether they are &s;uperiors, equals, or inferiors: a generous candour to|wards their faults; and a readine&s;s to bear with their little infirmities, pre|judices, and humours. All this will be the natural overflowing of a bene|volent heart. And though we do not &s;ay, that whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an obliging civility of manners, mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, al&s;o have a benevolent heart; (for an obliging behaviour is &s;ometimes natu|ral, and &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umed) yet it may not be improper for tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to attain this great principle, to begin with a gentlene&s;s of behaviour; as an excellent mean to &s;often the heart, and render it &s;u&s;ceptible of benign impre&s;|&s;ions. Such a behaviour may, per|haps,
<PB N="230" REF="222">
be more a&s;&s;i&s;tant to us, in at|taining the principle it&s;elf, than at &s;ight appears.</P>
