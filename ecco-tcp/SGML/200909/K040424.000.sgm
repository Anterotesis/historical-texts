<P>IN drawing up this Report, according to the plan laid down by the Board of Agriculture, we have endeavoured to be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, except in tho&s;e articles which are in a great mea&s;ure peculiar to this di&s;trict, &s;ome of which, we have rea&s;on to think, may be adopted with advantage in others.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, in an undertaking of this kind, to de&s;cribe all the minutiae of practice, or to notice every local improvement; but we hope that the mo&s;t prominent features of the Agriculture of Northum|berland, as exi&s;ting in <HI>1795,</HI> will be found faith|fully recorded in the following &s;heets.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 3.&mdash;<HI>Climate.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>The Climate</HI>&mdash;in regard to temperature, is &s;ubject to great variation; upon the mountains, &s;now will often continue for &s;everal months, (and may frequently be &s;een there of a con&s;iderable depth) when there is none in the lower di&s;tricts. The weather is very incon&s;tant, but mo&s;t|ly
<PB N="3" REF="11">runs in extremes. In the Spring months, the cold, piercing, ea&s;terly winds are mo&s;t prevalent; and our longe&s;t droughts are always accompanied by them: in &s;ome places they have acquired the name of <HI>&s;ea-pines,</HI> from the &s;low progre&s;s vegetation makes whenever they con|tinue for a few weeks. Rain is of little u&s;e while they prevail, from the great cold which always attends them.</P>
<P>The mild we&s;tern and &s;outhern breezes rarely take place before June; they are certain harbingers of rain and vigorous vegetation, and are the mo&s;t prevailing winds through the Summer and Autumn: In the latter &s;ea&s;on, they often blow with tempe&s;tuous fury, da&s;h out the corn, and di&s;appoint the ju&s;t hopes of the indu&s;trious farmer.</P>
<P>Our greate&s;t falls of &s;now, or rain, are from the &s;outh, or &s;outh-ea&s;t; and whenever we have a very high <HI>we&s;t wind,</HI> it is a certain &s;ign that a great quantity of rain is falling to the we&s;tward, in Cumberland and Roxburgh|&s;hire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. 4.</HI>&mdash;Soil and Surface.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A &s;trong fertile clayey loam</HI>&mdash;occupies the level tract of country along the coa&s;t, and reaches as far up in general as the great po&s;t road. It is well adapted to the culture of wheat, pul&s;e, clover, and grazing.</P>
<P><HI>Sandy, gravelly, and dry loam</HI>&mdash;or what is here more generally under&s;tood by turnip &s;oil, is found on the banks of the Tyne, from Newburn to Haltwhi&s;tle; on the Co|quet, about and above Rothbury; on the Aln, from its mouth to Alnwick; and down Tweed-&s;ide: But the greate&s;t quantity of this kind of &s;oil is found in the vales of Breami&s;h, Till, and Beaumont. The hills &s;urrounding the Cheviot mountains are mo&s;tly a dry, channelly, &s;harp-pointed, gravelly loam.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"><HI>Moi&s;t Loams</HI>&mdash;on a wet, cold, clayey bottom, occupy a large portion of this county, being un&s;afe for &s;heep, and unfit for turnips; they are principally employed in grow|ing grain, rearing young cattle, and feeding ewes and lambs. This &s;oil prevails mo&s;t in the middle and &s;outh|ea&s;t parts of the county.</P>
<P><HI>Black Peat Earth</HI>&mdash;is the prevailing &s;oil in mo&s;t of the mountainous di&s;tricts, and is found in many places through the lower parts of the county.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of this county, in re&s;pect to &s;urface, is mark|ed with great variety; along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, it is nearly level; towards the middle, the &s;urface is more diver&s;ified, and thrown into large &s;welling ridges, formed by the principal rivers:&mdash;The&s;e parts are well inclo&s;ed; in &s;ome places enriched with wood and recent plantations, but the general appearance is de&s;titute of tho&s;e ornaments:&mdash; The we&s;tern part (except a few intervening vales) is an exten&s;ive &s;cene of open, mountainous di&s;trict, where the hand of Cultivation is rarely to be traced.</P>
<P>Of the mountainous di&s;tricts, tho&s;e around Cheviot are the mo&s;t valuable; being in general fine green hills, thrown (by &s;ome of tho&s;e convul&s;ive changes which this globe has at &s;ome time experienced) into numberle&s;s variety of forms; the verdant, &s;wift-&s;loping &s;ides of which, inclo&s;e and &s;helter many deep, narrow glens: through the whole of this di&s;trict no mineral or other kind of &s;tone is found, except brown, red, and grey whin&s;tone: &mdash;they extend from the head of Coquet, down to Allen|ton; from thence northward to Prendwick, Branton, Il|derton, Wooler, Kirknewton, and Mindrim, and occupy at lea&s;t an area of 90000 acres.</P>
<P>The other mountainous di&s;tricts lie chiefly on the we&s;tern part of the county, &s;ome of which adjoin the county of Durham; but the large&s;t portion extends from the Ro|man Wall to the river Coquet (with a few intervening
<PB N="5" REF="13">inclo&s;ed vales) and to the moors north of Rothbury.&mdash; They are not marked by any &s;triking irregularities of &s;ur|face, being in general exten&s;ive, open, &s;olitary wa&s;tes, growing little el&s;e but heath, and affording a hard &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence to the flocks that depa&s;ture them.</P>

<P>To the coal-owners the winning and working the&s;e collieries are very expen&s;ive, and frequently attended with con&s;iderable ri&s;que; for tho' very large fortunes have been made in the bu&s;ine&s;s, yet many have been lo&s;t; the unexpected alteration of the &s;trata, from dykes and other troubles; the frequent and dreadful explo&s;ions from in|flammable air; the great depth of the &s;hafts, and increa&s;|ing quantities of water to be rai&s;ed from them, baffle the mo&s;t experienced arti&s;ts, and overcome the amazing pow|ers of the fire-engine, which of late years has received many improvements, and been made to perform what was thought ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible at its fir&s;t introduction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were informed that there was only one fire-engine in the neighbourhood of Newea&s;tle, about 50 years &s;ince,&mdash;that it rai&s;ed the water only 40 yards, which, at that time, was thought a wonderful performance; at pre&s;ent water is rai&s;ed, and probably in greater abundance, 160 yards, and upwards.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e powerful machines are now applied to the pur|po&s;es of drawing coals, which bu&s;ine&s;s was formerly uni|ver&s;ally performed by hor&s;es; frequently 8 to a &s;haft, where great quantities were drawn and di&s;patch was ne|ce&s;&s;ary; but by the invention and application of the draw|ing machines, a great many hor&s;es were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
<PB N="10" REF="18">the collieries; which has con&s;iderably reduced the con|&s;umption of oats in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Many of the collieries are &s;ituated at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the river, to which the coals are conveyed from the pits in a peculiar kind of carriage, called a <HI>New-ca&s;tle coalwaggon; (pl.</HI> 1, <HI>fig.</HI> 1.) it has 4 &s;mall wheels, about 34 inches diameter, <HI>fixed to the axles,</HI> with which they turn round, and move on a road (called the waggon-way) made on purpo&s;e <HI>with wood,</HI> which is formed by long pieces of wood (RA, rails) about 4 inches &s;quare, laid length-ways, upon &s;leepers of wood (SSS) and the thickne&s;s of the rail above the plane of the re&s;t of the road, and at the exact di&s;tance of the waggon wheels from each other, as it is upon tho&s;e rails the wheels run.</P>
<P>A new waggon-way (including timber, levelling, gravel|ing, and workman&s;hip) will co&s;t about 5s. per yard, or 440l. per mile; and the expence of keeping it in repair is generally about 1&frac12;d. per chaldron on a quantity of 15000 chaldrons annually, or 93l. 15s. 0d. per mile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that a waggon-way might be &s;ub&s;titu|ted in lieu of turnpike roads, for the conveyance of heavy goods; but we pre&s;ume, that the expence of fir&s;t making, laying out in nearly a level line, or &s;o as to have little or no a&s;cent, and keep|ing in repair, would greatly overbalance the additional weight to be drawn by one hor&s;e; as the wood rots and wa&s;tes nearly as much by a &s;mall quantity of carriage pa&s;&s;ing along it, as a larger.</NOTE></P>

But the 10th, 13th, and 14th, are all workable &s;eams, and will afford con&s;iderable quan|tities of coal; the aggregate of the three making nearly 9&frac12; feet thick; &s;o that the total thickne&s;s of the workable &s;eams in this colliery amount to 22 feet.</P>

<P>But there are &s;ome rea&s;ons to think, that a thickne&s;s of &s;eam equal to 6 yards will not be obtained over an ex|tent of 200 &s;quare miles; probably not more on an aver|age than 4 yards; in which ca&s;e, the coal will be exhau&s;t|ed in 550 years: and if the aggregate thickne&s;s of the &s;eams to be obtained &s;hould prove only three yards, then little more than 400 years will be the term of continu|ance; but it is probable, that before the half of that time be elap&s;ed, the price to the con&s;umer will be con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, from the increa&s;ed expence of ob|taining them, and the increa&s;ed length of carriage from the pits to the river. This la&s;t, we pre&s;ume, may be re|duced in &s;ome &s;ituations, by adopting canals in&s;tead of waggon-ways, which we have often wondered have never yet been attempted.</P>
<P>From the above inve&s;tigation it appears, that Mr Williams's apprehen&s;ions are not &s;o chimerical at have been repre&s;ented; how far it may be right for the legi&s;|lature to interfere, we leave to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e more conver&s;ant in political &s;peculations.</P>
<P>Of the coal found all thro' Bambro' Ward, I&s;land&s;hire, and tho&s;e parts of Glendale Ward ea&s;t of the river Till, the &s;eams are very thin, mo&s;tly from 1 to 3 feet thick, and of a very inferior quality, yielding a great quantity of a&s;hes, and neither caking in the fire, nor burning to a cinder: they are u&s;ed only for home-con&s;umption, and for burning lime; for the latter purpo&s;e they are well adapted, by their property of neither caking nor burning to a cinder; and it luckily happens, that thro' all this di&s;|trict, the coal and lime are generally found together; a circum&s;tance which greatly facilitates and le&s;&s;ens the ex|pence of burning lime.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28">If a line be drawn from Alemouth to a little we&s;t of Bywell on the river Tyne, very little of this kind of coal and lime&s;tone will be found to the ea&s;t of it; and from this line to the &s;ea coa&s;t, no lime&s;tone whatever ap|pears, except a &s;mall patch of a different lime&s;tone that puts in at Whitley, near Tynemouth, and runs from thence in a &s;outh-we&s;terly direction thro' the county of Durham, &amp;c. In this &s;pace, betwixt the&s;e two ranges of lime&s;tone, lie the caking coals of &s;uperior quality above de|&s;cribed, and the &s;ame breadth of coal may be traced thro' the county of Durham, &s;tretching in the &s;ame direction, and bounded on the ea&s;t and we&s;t, in a &s;imilar manner, by &s;tretches of lime&s;tone of different kinds.</P>
<P>It would be a curious inve&s;tigation to trace the&s;e mi|nerals thro' the different counties acro&s;s the i&s;land, and &s;how where the &s;trata of each &s;pecies ri&s;e to the &s;urface; and the deviations cau&s;ed in them by cro&s;s veins or dykes, &amp;c.; we believe it will be found that very little or no coal lies to the ea&s;t of this line, and that no chalk lies to the we&s;t.</P>

<P>The mines which produce lead ore are very fluctuating, and uncertain in point of profit to the adventurers; but tend to a general good, by giving employment to a numer|ous cla&s;s of indu&s;trious workmen, who, being &s;ituated in a climate improper for the production of grain, are oblig|ed to receive the greate&s;t part of their provi&s;ions from the more fertile di&s;tricts of the county, and by tho&s;e means encourage its agriculture.</P>

<P>The Tyne and Tweed are the mo&s;t eminent for their navigation, the tide flowing up the former 16 miles, and up the latter eight or ten; the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a &s;mall di&s;tance from their mouths; of the&s;e the Blyth and Aln are of the mo&s;t im|portance, from the convenience which the fir&s;t affords to its neighbourhood, for the exportation of con&s;iderable quantities of coals; and both of them for corn, &amp;c. and the importation of timber, iron, and other u&s;eful articles.</P>

<P>ESTATES vary in their annual value from 20l. to up|wards of 20000l. a year;&mdash;one in particular is upwards of 40000l.&mdash;Small e&s;tates from 20l. to 200l. a year, are found in the &s;outhern and middle parts of the county, but very rarely in the northern.</P>
<P>There are probably few parts of the kingdom where e&s;tates have made &s;uch rapid improvements as in this county; there being &s;everal in&s;tances of the value being
<PB N="25" REF="33">more than trebled within the la&s;t 40 years. Many cau|&s;es have certainly been aiding to produce this great ef|fect; but the principal one is attributed to letting large farms, and lea&s;es for 21 years; by which means the te|nants of capital were encouraged to make tho&s;e great ex|ertions, from which &s;uch advantages have re&s;ulted, not only to them&s;elves and proprietors of the land, but to the community at large, from the very increa&s;ed produce, and &s;uperiority of its quality.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual mode of letting farms is to fix a rent, under certain conditions and covenants, 6 or 12 months before the expiration of the lea&s;e; but upon one of the large&s;t e&s;tates in the county,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Tankerville's.</NOTE> the tenants have an offer of their farms 2&frac12; <HI>or</HI> 3 <HI>years</HI> before the expiration of the lea&s;e, which is a mutual benefit to both landlord and tenant; and is attended with &s;o many advantages, that it is in a fair way of being generally adopted.</P>
<P>On &s;ome e&s;tates the practice of letting farms by <HI>&s;ecret propo&s;als</HI> is &s;till in u&s;e: this is a dark and my&s;terious mode, which frequently defeats the end it is intended to accompli&s;h, and in&s;tead, of obtaining an <HI>exce&s;&s;ive high rent,</HI> the prize has been often gained at a <HI>very inferior value;</HI> and, in the language of the turf, (where only one has en|tered the li&s;ts) "by walking the cour&s;e:" and we have known &s;ome of the fir&s;t farmers in the county forego their farms, rather than &s;ubmit to contend in the dark. Upon mo&s;t e&s;tates it is generally &s;tipulated, that a certain portion of the be&s;t old grazing, lands, on each farm, &s;hall be kept in gra&s;s during the whole term.</P>
<P>The quantity of land to be in ploughing is mo&s;tly limit|ed to a certain number of acres; and at the expiration of the term, where the tenant quits on the 12th of May, he is allowed to have a crop of corn from off two-thirds of the arable lands; this is called the <HI>way-going crop:</HI> the

<P>For &s;owing <HI>beans</HI> or <HI>pea&s;e</HI> at wide intervals, viz. from 27 to 30 inches, I u&s;e a drill with only one wheel and one cylinder, which a man wheels before him in the fur|row, or (what I find much better) it may be fixed in the body of a &s;mall plough, (drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e) with one &s;tilt that pa&s;&s;es between the wheel and the &s;eed-box, (<HI>fig.</HI> 5, <HI>pl.</HI> 1.)

With the &s;ame &s;mall plough and drill I have &s;own both wheat and barley, at different

<P>It is fixed to the plough by two pieces of iron going from the ends of the drill; one to the beam at B, and the other to the &s;tilt at C, and moving round, on bolts, allow the wheel W to fall and ri&s;e with every accidental hollow or eminence.</P>

<P><HI>Thre&s;hing Machines&mdash;</HI> are now becoming general in the northern parts of the country; they are all upon the prin|ciple of the flax mill; which principle was fir&s;t introduced into this county for thre&s;hing corn, by Mr Edward Greg|&s;on, near 32 years &s;ince; the machine he u&s;ed was work|ed by a man, who could thre&s;h with it 12 bu&s;hels of wheat in a day; but being hard work, and Mr Greg&s;on dying &s;oon after, it was neglected. Mr Wm Menzie, who was &s;er|vant with Mr Greg&s;on at the time, &s;ays "that his ma&s;ter took the idea from a &s;mall flax mill which a Scotchman travelled the country with, for the purpo&s;e of &s;wingling the flax which the farmers grew for their own u&s;e: this portable flax mill was carried in a cart from one farm|hou&s;e to another, being a cylinder of 5 or 5&frac12; feet diame|ter, and 18 inches wide; the &s;witchers were driven by his foot, with a crank like a cutler's wheel; and that the thre&s;hing machine Mr Greg&s;on had, was made at that time, and exactly the &s;ame as the &s;aid flax mill."&mdash;Mr Tho. Greg&s;on thinks that his brother Edward had &s;een &s;ome|thing of a &s;imilar nature in Scotland, probably the &s;ame which Mr D. Meldrum gives an account of, about the &s;ame time, in a letter to Mr William Charge of Clea&s;by, in the county of York, which he de&s;cribes as being the &s;ame as the flax mill; that it thre&s;hed 150 bu&s;hels of
<PB N="47" REF="58">oats a day, which dropped through a &s;kreen into a win|nowing machine, that dre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Mr Oxley erected a thre&s;hing machine at Flodden, moved by hor&s;es, in which the corn was fed-in betwixt two <HI>fluted rollers,</HI> and &s;truck by &s;witch|ers, placed as tho&s;e are in the pre&s;ent machines; only they are <HI>hung on hinges.</HI> Tho&s;e in u&s;e now, are <HI>fixed</HI> as were tho&s;e of Mr Greg&s;on's. The complaint of Mr Oxley's machine was, that it did not thre&s;h common oats clean, probably for want of velocity; for it is found in the machines now u&s;ed, that if the &s;witchers move with a velocity of 1500 feet per minute, they will not thre&s;h clean; and experience has proved, that to thre&s;h com|mon oats clean, requires a velocity of 2500 feet per minute.</P>
<P>Mr Ilderton erected two thre&s;hing machines, one at Ilderton and another at Hawkhill, worked by hor&s;es, the principle of which was to rub the grain out by pro|jecting pieces of wood, (on the circumference of a large cylinder) rubbing again&s;t &s;everal <HI>fluted rollers:</HI> he u&s;ed it many years, but it was frequently nece&s;&s;ary to put the &s;traw twice thro' before it was perfectly clean.</P>
<P>We were informed by the late Sir Francis Kinlock, Bart. of Gilmerton, Scotland, that while he was at|tempting to perfect Mr Ilderton's machine, he &s;aw a port|able flax mill, made for the u&s;e of poor families, worked by a man. It &s;truck him that it would thre&s;h corn, and he got one made, with the addition of two &s;mooth rollers for taking in the corn; the work being too hard for a man, he &s;ent it to Mr Mickle's mill, to have it tried by water: &s;oon after, Mr Mickle's &s;on built a thre&s;hing mill at Kilbogie; and after ten or twelve had been erected in the neighbourhood, by other workmen, he applied to Mr Kinlock to take out a patent, who told him that he did not look upon it as an original invention, and that a pat|ent
<PB N="48" REF="59">would not be of any u&s;e. Some time after this, Mr Mickle took out a patent (for England only) in his own name, for the purpo&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e of &s;ecuring to him&s;elf his own combination of wheels, &amp;c. for movement of the various parts, as the leading principle of the machine had been applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;e at lea&s;t 20 years before.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Mickle is a very ingenious mechanic and tho' it appears he has not the merit of being the original inventor, yet he has added many u&s;eful improvements.</NOTE></P>
<P>At their fir&s;t introduction into this county, the corn and &s;traw were thrown out together upon the floor, and cau&s;ed great confu&s;ion: to remedy this, a &s;kreen was added, thro' which the grain dropped into a winnowing machine, and from off the &s;kreen the &s;traw was taken by a man: but a <HI>circular rake,</HI> invented about eight years &s;ince,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By Mr Balley, who fir&s;t applied it to his machine at Chil|lingham.</NOTE> performs the operation much better; and at the &s;ame time &s;aves a con&s;iderable expence. This rake is now added to all tho&s;e that have been lately erected; and only cau&s;es an addition to the machinery of one light wheel. The&s;e machines are moved both by water and by hor&s;es; two, four, and even &s;ix of the latter are &s;ometimes employed; the former is certainly the be&s;t power where it can be obtained.</P>
<P>From a review of the whole, it appears that the princi|ple of the flax mill had been applied by different per&s;ons at different times, for the purpo&s;e of thre&s;hing corn; and &s;ince its being more generally u&s;ed, different per&s;ons have invented and u&s;ed various combinations of wheels and other contrivances to effect the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and render the machine more perfect.</P>
<P>The &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful combinations and contri|vances are certainly the be&s;t: but who&s;e are entitled to
<PB N="49" REF="60">this appellation we do not pretend to determine; the public mu&s;t judge for them&s;elves.&mdash;The combination we &s;hall offer is different to any we have &s;een, for which rea&s;on, and being that where the fir&s;t circular rake was applied, we &s;hall give</P>

<P><HI>The Winnowing Machine</HI> is in univer&s;al u&s;e here; we believe very little, if any corn is dre&s;&s;ed by any other means: They were fir&s;t made by a farmer of a mechanical genius called ROGERS, who lived at Cavers near Hawick, and who&s;e grand&s;on, now a carpenter there, &s;till makes them, perhaps of as u&s;eful a form as any other per&s;on, and at as low rates as from 2l. 8s. to 3l.</P>
<P>Old Rogers, we are told by his de&s;cendant, happen|ed in the year 1733 to &s;ee a machine, thrown out of the way as u&s;ele&s;s, in an old granary at Leith, of which he took &s;uch notice, that, on his return home, he &s;et about making one, the utility of which &s;oon recommended it to many principal farmers: in a few years they were u|niver&s;ally u&s;ed, and are now become &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, where large quantities of corn are to be dre&s;&s;ed, that it would be attended with con&s;iderable inconvenience to do without them; of &s;uch great utility has been the &s;u|perior di&s;cernment of this ingenious and unnoticed in|dividual!</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Mr Rogers &s;ays, he believes the machine his grandfather &s;aw at Leith, was brought from Holland: An anonymous remarker, who &s;igns him&s;elf a Scotch Far|mer, &s;tates "that it was fir&s;t introduced by the late cele|brated Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, along with the bar|ley mill, from Holland, in the year 1711;" and we have &s;omewhere read or heard, that the Dutch brought it
<PB N="55" REF="67">from the Chine&s;e, which is corroborated by the informa|tion we lately received from the Honourable Mr Doug|la&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;on of the Earl of Selkirk.</NOTE> who was &s;hewn (when on his travels in France) by the late Duke de Rochefoucalt, a &s;et of Chine&s;e drawings, repre&s;enting the culture of rice in all its &s;tages, from the fir&s;t planting to its being prepared for &s;ale, and that the la&s;t drawing was a repre&s;entation of the <HI>dre&s;&s;ing</HI> or <HI>win|nowing,</HI> which was performed by a <HI>machine exactly &s;imilar to that we now u&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A pair of pruning &s;hears,</HI> repre&s;ented in fig. 1, pl. 5, have been particularly recommended by Mr Tweddell, of Threepwood, to the Pre&s;ident of the Board, as being &s;u|perior to any other implement for the purpo&s;e of cutting hedges.&mdash;They con&s;i&s;t of a &s;trong &s;harp kni&s;e 6 inches long, moving betwixt two &s;quare-edged cheeks; the up|per handle is 2 feet 6 inches long, and the other 2 feet 3 inches.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VI.</HI> INCLOSURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE parts of this county capable of cultivation are in
<PB N="56" REF="68">general well inclo&s;ed by live hedges; the only exception is a &s;mall part of the vales of Breami&s;h, Till, and Glen: but even here, the advantage of having well-fenced fields is &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o much de&s;ired by the tenants, that we hope, in eight or ten years, the whole of this valuable di&s;trict will be inclo&s;ed by proper fences.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of inclo&s;ures varies with the &s;ize of farms. In &s;ome parts, from two to &s;ix or eight acres; in the nor|thern parts, where the farms are large, the fields are from 20 to 100 acres.</P>
<P><HI>The fences</HI> mo&s;t generally u&s;ed for new inclo&s;ures, are earth mounds; at the ba&s;e of which, and on the edge of the ditch out of which they are rai&s;ed, are planted the quicks, generally upon a turned &s;od &s;ix inches high; which we think too low, as we always find the quicks grow much better when planted three &s;ods high, with the thickne&s;s of two &s;urface &s;ods laid under their roots. This in mo&s;t ca&s;es doubles, and in thin &s;oil trebles, the &s;urface &s;oil, and forms a thick bed of the be&s;t earth for the roots of the quicks to grow in, as will be more clearly &s;een in the annexed &s;ketch of &s;uch a &s;ence, fig. 2, pl. 5, where AB is the ditch, 4&frac12; feet wide at top; BCD the mound; the ba&s;e BD, &s;ix feet wide; and height CD, four feet.

<P>The quicks &s;hould never be planted nearer each other than nine inches, and upon good land a foot. Quicks four or five years old, with &s;trong clean &s;tems, are always to be preferred to tho&s;e that are younger and &s;maller.</P>

<P><HI>Gates</HI> are made of various forms, but agree nearly in &s;ize, being generally 8&frac12; feet wide, and from 4&frac14; to 5 feet high, with 5 &s;trong bars about 3&frac12; inches deep, and a weaker one about 1 inch &s;quare, placed between the two lowe&s;t bars.&mdash;The lighter a gate is, e&s;pecially in the fore|part, the better, provided it be &s;ufficiently &s;trong; for this rea&s;on the top bar &s;hould be con&s;iderably &s;tronger than the re&s;t, as it is the mo&s;t liable to be broken, e&s;pe|cially where hor&s;es are kept, if not made &s;o high that they cannot ea&s;ily get their necks over it.

<P>Having &s;et the po&s;t perpendicular, let a plumb-line,

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 1.&mdash;<HI>Tillage.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE arable lands of this county being under various &s;y&s;tems, and directed by various opinions, the manage|ment of the tillage mu&s;t differ con&s;iderably.&mdash;In the oper|ation of ploughing, it is generally agreed that the breadth of the furrow &s;hould be about 9 inches, and the depth from 4 to 6 or 7 inches.</P>
<P>It was formerly the general practice not to plough the lands intended for fallow till after Spring &s;eed-time, (and very often delayed till May, or even June) but now the fallows are ploughed before Winter, to meliorate by the fro&s;t.&mdash;In the middle of April or beginning of May, tho&s;e that are intended for <HI>turnips</HI> or <HI>potatoes</HI> are harrow|ed
<PB N="60" REF="73">and ploughed <HI>acro&s;s,</HI> and, where nece&s;&s;ary, rolled with a heavy roller; the &s;ame operations are repeated two, or three, or more times, until it is thought &s;ufficiently fine and clean for &s;owing or planting.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are intended to be naked &s;allow for wheat, receive three, four, of five ploughings through the Sum|mer; but are &s;eldom harrowed, it being thought an ad|vantage to wheat to have the land cloddy.</P>
<P>On tho&s;e fallows where quickens or couch gra&s;s, &amp;c. are found, every exertion is u&s;ed to extirpate them, by harrowing, gathering and burning, or leading off, &s;o long as the &s;malle&s;t remains are vi&s;ible. The lime and manure are mo&s;tly laid on before the la&s;t ploughing.</P>
<P>For barley, it is the general cu&s;tom to plough only once; but the be&s;t cultivators &s;eldom &s;ow this grain with|out giving two or three ploughings, e&s;pecially when the land is to be &s;own with clover and gra&s;s feeds.</P>
<P>Every other &s;pecies of grain is &s;own after one plough|ing, except when beans or pea&s;e are to be drilled.</P>
<P><HI>Trench Ploughing,</HI> is practi&s;ed by a few; it is an excel|len mode for breaking up gra&s;s lands, and is performed by two ploughs following each other in the &s;ame furrow; the fir&s;t plough paring off the &s;urface, from 1 to 1&frac12; inches thick, and turning it into the bottom of the la&s;t-made furrow: While the &s;econd plough, going 3 or 4 inches deeper, turns upon it a &s;od of friable earth, which being de&s;titute of tough fibrous roots, harrows to a &s;ine mould with little difficulty.</P>
<P>This practice entirely obviates the objections to drilling upon clover lea, and the additional expence will not be more than 4s. per acre, which, put in competition with the advantages to be derived from it, will leave a con&s;ider|able balance in favour of the practice: in breaking up old &s;wards, on clayey lands, the expence is almo&s;t &s;aved in the harrowing; on &s;uch &s;oils it will be found of great
<PB N="61" REF="74">&s;ervice, if they are <HI>thus ploughed</HI> in Autumn, they may be ea&s;ily drilled with beans or pea&s;e in the Spring, and the &s;ub&s;equent hoeings performed with facility; operations that would be very difficult to perform, when ploughed in the manner u&s;ually practi&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>The Ridges</HI> are of various forms and &s;izes.&mdash;On the deep &s;oiled lands, that were u&s;ed as arable &s;ome centuries &s;ince, the ridges are mo&s;tly very high, broad, and crook|ed;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a dangerous experiment to attempt to level and &s;traight|en ridges of this de&s;cription too &s;uddenly; we have &s;een much mi&s;chief done by it.</NOTE> upon lands that have been lately brought into cul|tivation, they are &s;traight, nearly flat, and in general a|bout twelve or fifteen feet broad; on dry lands, they are quite flat, and alternately gathered and &s;plit. A breadth of fifteen feet an&s;wers be&s;t for &s;owing broad-ca&s;t at two ca&s;ts.</P>
<P>A few years &s;ince, the ploughing, and various other purpo&s;es, for which draughts are wanted upon a farm, were performed by hor&s;es, which in ploughing or harrow|ing are always yoked double, and driven with cords by the ploughman, and in general plough an acre a day; but in the &s;ea&s;on of &s;owing turnips, one and a half, or even two acres, are frequently ploughed, on <HI>fine light &s;oils.</HI> But &s;ince the great advance in the price of hor&s;es, oxen have been more u&s;ed, e&s;pecially for the purpo&s;es of ploughing, and carting <HI>about home.</HI></P>
<P>They are harne&s;&s;ed both with yokes and collars. Where three or four are u&s;ed, a boy is allowed to drive; when two,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Two oxen are &s;ound very &s;ufficient for ploughing light fal|low lands in Summer; but for almo&s;t every other purpo&s;e, 3 or 4 are u&s;ed.</NOTE> the man that holds the plough drives with cords.

On &s;uch other &s;oils as were found improper for this root, the naked fallows &s;till prevail, with an almo&s;t univer&s;al opinion, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the fertility of the land; yet there are &s;ome few who dare to doubt this long-e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine, and pre&s;ume to think, that na|ked fallows might be di&s;pen&s;ed with in <HI>many &s;ituations,</HI> by cultivating leguminous crops, <HI>drilled at wide intervals,</HI> to admit being <HI>ploughed,</HI> or <HI>hor&s;e-hoed</HI> between: to which, if <HI>proper hand-hoeings</HI> be added, the land will be as well pre|pared for wheat, as if it had been a compleat naked fallow.</P>
<P>This is not advanced on &s;peculation or theory; in&s;tan|ces can be produced, where no naked fallows have been made on fields of &s;trong loam for 12 years, yet they are as clear of quickens, couch-gra&s;s, or other pernicious weeds, as any fields in the di&s;trict, that have been under naked fallow two or three times in the &s;ame period.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, previous to the adop|tion of this &s;y&s;tem, the land was cleared of quicken, or couch-gra&s;s, by a complete &s;ummer fallowing.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whether fallowing is or is not nece&s;&s;ary, has been much agitated of late years; &s;o much &s;o, that the diffe|rent parti&s;ans have obtained the appellation of <HI>"fallow|e&s;ts,"</HI> and <HI>"antifallowe&s;ts:"</HI> It happens to be one of tho&s;e &s;ubjects which can never be determined by rea&s;oning, o|pinions, or bold a&s;&s;ertions; <HI>fair experiments</HI> only can re&s;olve it; and whatever may be the re&s;ults of &s;uch ex|periments,
<PB N="63" REF="76">it may be ju&s;tly concluded, they will be the &s;ame in &s;imilar &s;oils, climates, and &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Tho' we are diffident in giving a decided opinion up|on &s;o important a &s;ubject, yet from ob&s;ervations made on the above facts, we cannot help being inclined to think, that the quantity of maked fallow might be very much reduced, and in another century will probably be totally aboli&s;hed, if no fortuitous circum&s;tances ari&s;e to check the exertions and &s;pirit for improvement, which have been &s;o prevalent of late years, and &s;o generally dif|fu&s;ed thro' this di&s;trict.</P>

<P><HI>Steeping</HI> in chamberlye, and powdering with quick lime immediately after, to make it &s;ufficiently dry for &s;owing, is generally practi&s;ed; the &s;mut is &s;eldom &s;een where this is properly performed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a practice of 40 years, the Me&s;&s;rs Culley have only had one in&s;tance of &s;mut in their crops of wheat, and this was where the &s;eed had not been &s;teeped; and for a number of years they have not grown le&s;s than from four hundred to &s;ix hundred acres yearly.</NOTE> and &s;ome go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that it will cure &s;mutty &s;eed;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A field at Chillingham was &s;own in 1795 with wheat, in which were <HI>a few balls of &s;mut;</HI> one-third of the &s;eed was &s;teep|ed in chamberlye and limed; one-third &s;teeped in chamberlye, dried and not limed; the remainder was &s;own without either &s;teeping or liming, in the harve&s;t of 1796; the whole had a few &s;traggling heads of &s;mut, but appeared to be mo&s;t in that which was un&s;teeped.&mdash;Mr Thomp&s;on, of Chillingham Barns, made a &s;i|milar experiment, and had &s;mut equally alike in the pickled and unpickled, but the <HI>head ridges were con&s;iderably the wor&s;t;</HI> from hence it appears that &s;teeping in chamberlye is not a prevent|ive in all ca&s;es.&mdash;It may be proper to remark, that there are more complaints of &s;mut this year, than any other we remember; in &s;ome places even barley was very much affected.&mdash;We believe, that on examination, the &s;tamina will always be found adhering to the balls of &s;mut, from which a &s;u&s;picion ari&s;es, that the cau&s;e may be ow|ing to &s;ome defect in tho&s;e parts, probably from injuries re|ceived by in&s;ects, weather, &amp;c. as we frequently find the &s;ame ear bearing the mo&s;t perfect grains along with grains of &s;mut.&mdash; The &s;ame experiment was repeated in 1796, and intended to be continued for &s;ome years.</NOTE>&mdash; it is done by throwing the
<PB N="68" REF="81">wheat into a ve&s;&s;el full of chamberlye, &s;tirring it about with a &s;trong &s;tick, and &s;kimming off the light grains as they appear on the &s;urface; when this is done, the liquor is let off, (by a plug or cock at the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el) and the wheat taken out and mixed with quick lime; after this, the &s;ooner it is &s;own the better, becau&s;e it is apt to heat and &s;poil if &s;uffered to continue in the &s;acks, or in large heaps; but if dried and &s;pread thin on a gra|nary floor, will keep &s;everal days.</P>

<P><HI>The varieties,</HI>&mdash;are the Green Top, the Red Top, and the White Top; which la&s;t, is by far the mo&s;t general

<P>There is a &s;mall hard white kind, preferred by &s;ome on account (it is &s;aid) of &s;tanding the winter better than mo&s;t others, but it does not grow near &s;o large a quantity upon an acre.</P>
<P>At their fir&s;t introduction they were &s;own broad-ca&s;t, and hoed by gardeners and other men, at extrava|gant wages. The late ingenious Mr Ilderton, about twenty-&s;even years &s;ince, had the merit of fir&s;t reducing the price of hoeing, by teaching boys, girls, and women, to perform the work equally as well, if not better, than men. The mode he took was &s;imple and ingenious: By a light plough, without a mould-board, he divided the field into &s;mall &s;quares of equal magnitude, and directed the boys and girls to leave a certain number of plants in each &s;quare. In a &s;hort time they became accurate, re|gular, and expert hoers; and in a few years all the tur|nips of the country were hoed by women and boys, at half the expence, and better than by men.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent mode of drilling turnips was fir&s;t introdu|ced into this county about the year 1780; the advantages with which it is attended have &s;o far recommended the practice, that very few are now &s;own broad-ca&s;t;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The broad-ca&s;t culture of turnips in the northern parts of the county, for many years previous to this, was not inferior to any we ever &s;aw; and in re&s;pect to <HI>accurate, regular, clean hoeing,</HI> &s;uperior to what we ever ob&s;erved in <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk,</HI> or other turnip di&s;tricts, which we have frequently examined.</NOTE> and as we think it is an operation that may be &s;erviceable in o|ther di&s;tricts, we &s;hall be more particular in de&s;cribing the manner of performing it.</P>

<P>The next operation is &s;preading the dung; which is performed by a cart going down every third or fifth fur|row, and laying the dung in &s;mall heaps; women and boys follow with &s;mall three-pronged forks, and &s;pread it evenly in the bottom of three or five furrows, that is, the one where the dung is dropped from the cart, and tho&s;e on each &s;ide of it: this done, the ploughman &s;plits the one-bout ridges before rai&s;ed, and covers up the dung ex|actly in the middle; but before the &s;eed can be &s;own, the&s;e la&s;t formed one-bout ridges require to be flattened at the top, by a &s;mall roller that flattens two ridges at once. Upon the top, and exactly in the middle of the&s;e flattened ridges, the &s;eed is depo&s;ited by one or two drill machines, tied to the roller by a rope &s;ix or &s;even feet long; at which di&s;tance they follow the roller, each ma|chine being guided by a man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See fig. 3, pl. 2.</NOTE> When fini&s;hed, the work appears in this form:

<P>When the plants have four leaves, we begin to hoe; and as they have &s;o much room &s;ideways, we leave them only eight or nine inches di&s;tance from one another in the rows or drills. The hoers go &s;ideways, and pull the &s;ur|plus plants, weeds, &amp;c. into the hollow intervals between the one-bout ridges, and the turnips are left as regular as if they were planted. This work is performed by women and children, with the greate&s;t care and exactne&s;s, at the expence of four &s;hillings per acre.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the plants are recovered, which will be in eight or ten days, a &s;mall plough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See fig. 3, pl. 1.</NOTE> (five inches wide at the bottom behind, and eleven inches at top) drawn by one hor&s;e, takes the earth from the turnip rows, and with the &s;oil covers the weeds, &amp;c. which the hoers had pulled into the hollow intervals between the ridges. A &s;econd hoeing takes place, when the plants are &s;trong enough, and otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary; and a few days after, the &s;oil or earth before ploughed from the turnip rows, into the hol|low intervals, is now equally divided and laid up to each drill or ridge again, by the &s;ame &s;mall plough and one hor&s;e, or with a double mould-board plough.&mdash;This fi|ni&s;hes the bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s the land has been very wild and out of condition, and requires more hoeing and ploughing between the drills.</P>
<P>If the drills are made in the &s;ame directions of the rid|ges at the next ploughing for corn, the &s;urface will be ir|regular, and the dung unequally di&s;tributed. To avoid this, on dry level lands, the drills are made diagonally a|cro&s;s the field; but where the ridges are high, it is be&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="99">to make the drills <HI>directly acro&s;s</HI> the ridges, and draw a plough down the furrows to take off the water.</P>

<HEAD><HI>HISTORY</HI> OF DRILLED TURNIPS.</HEAD>
<P>TO trace u&s;eful di&s;coveries from their origin, through their various &s;tages of improvement, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es both u&s;eful and entertaining; and teaches us not to de&s;pair, though our fir&s;t attempts may be un&s;ucce&s;sful; but rather hope, that by per&s;everance, and varying modes and cir|cum&s;tances, we &s;hall at la&s;t attain the object &s;ought for. The method of cultivating turnips, de&s;cribed above, is an encouraging in&s;tance of this ob&s;ervation:&mdash;as we find that Mr Tull fir&s;t cultivated turnips at three feet di&s;tance;&mdash;for in his E&s;&s;ay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegeta|tion, under the article Turnips, page 96, he &s;ays, "When I drilled upon the level<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is impo&s;&s;ible to hoe-plough them &s;o well when planted upon the level, as when they are planted upon ridges; for if we plough deep near to the row, the earth will come over on the left &s;ide of the plough, and bury the young turnips; but when they &s;tand on ridges, the earth will almo&s;t all fall down on the right &s;ide into the furrow, in the middle of the interval."</NOTE> at three feet intervals, a trial was made between tho&s;e turnips, and a field of the next neighbour's, &s;own broad-ca&s;t at the &s;ame time, whereof
<PB N="87" REF="102">the hand-hoeing co&s;t ten &s;hillings per acre, and had not quite half the crop of the drilled; both being mea&s;ured by the bu&s;hel, on purpo&s;e to find the difference.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"And I have &s;ince found that turnips on the &s;ame land plant|ed on ridges, with &s;ix foot intervals, make a crop double to tho&s;e that are planted on the level, or even on ridges with three feet intervals."</NOTE></P>
<P>"Drilled turnips, by being no where but in the rows, may be more ea&s;ily &s;een that tho&s;e which come up at ran|dom; and may therefore be &s;ooner &s;ingled out by the hand-hoe, which is another advantage, becau&s;e the &s;oon|er<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"The &s;ooner they are made &s;ingle the better; but yet when they are not very thick, they may &s;tand till we have the be&s;t con|venience of &s;ingling them without much damage; but when they come up extraordinary thick, it will be much more difficult to make them &s;ingle, if they are neglected at their very fir&s;t coming into rough leaf."</NOTE> they are &s;ingled out the better they will thrive. <HI>Page</HI> 98.</P>
<P>"We need not be very exact in the number or di&s;|tance<NOTE PLACE="foot" N="&Dagger;">"The di&s;tance need not be regular; for when a turnip has &s;ix inches of room on one &s;ide, and eighteen on the other, it is almo&s;t as well as if there was one foot on each &s;ide."</NOTE> we &s;et them out at; we contrive to leave the ma&s;|ter turnips (when there is &s;o much difference in them) and &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;uch when near one another, and leave the more &s;pace before and behind them; but if there be three ma&s;|ter turnips together, we take out the middlemo&s;t. <HI>Page</HI> 100.</P>
<P>"Dung and tillage together will always attain the ne|ce&s;&s;ary degree of pulverization in le&s;s time than plough|ing can do alone; therefore dung is more u&s;eful for tur|nips, becau&s;e they have commonly le&s;s time to grow than other plants. <HI>Page</HI> 102.</P>
<P>"I have had great crops of turnips in rows three feet a&s;under, and much greater than I could ever obtain from
<PB N="88" REF="103">rows thirty inches a&s;under. But one rea&s;on why I like &s;ix foot rows better is, that the large&s;t turnips are be&s;t for oxen; and are pulled up and loaded with the lea&s;t expence.&mdash;I find that the lea&s;t competent number will <HI>(cateris paribus)</HI> always be the large&s;t. <HI>Preface, page</HI> ix.</P>
<P>"Several lands of turnips, drilled on the level of three foot rows, ploughed and doubly dunged, and al&s;o hor&s;e-hoed, did not produce near &s;o good a crop of turnips as &s;ix foot rows adjoining, hor&s;e-hoed, though no dung had been thereon for many years.</P>
<P>"There was no other difference, than that the three foot rows did not admit the hoe-plough to rai&s;e half the ar|tificial po&s;ture as the &s;ix foot rows did. The dung plough|ed into the narrow intervals before drilling, could oper|ate no farther with any great effect, than the hoe-plough could turn it up, and help it in its pulverization."</P>
<P>From the&s;e extracts it appears, that Mr Tull cultivated turnips in rows, not only on the level, but on the tops, of two and a half and three feet ridges, and both hor&s;e and hand-hoed, as at pre&s;ent; but whether he put dung in the bottom of tho&s;e ridges is not &s;o clear, from the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, "the dung ploughed into the narrow intervals before drilling." It is unfortunate that this ingenious gentleman, to &s;upport a whim&s;ical theory, &s;hould not al|low that dung was of any other u&s;e in vegetation, than in pulverizing the &s;oil; though he is obliged to admit, that for cabbages, turnips, carrots, and potatoes, it will make the crops greater, and the cattle will like them never the wor&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>But his di&s;ciples entertained ju&s;ter notions of the pro|perties and value of dung to neglect it, as will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>We are informed by a gentleman who went to direct the management of an e&s;tate in Dumfries&s;hire, in 1769,
<PB N="89" REF="104">that Mr Craik, of Arbigland, near Dumfries, had then drilled turnips betwixt twenty and thirty years; by tak|ing the medium, his fir&s;t beginning would be about 1745. The mode he pur&s;ued was as follows:&mdash;In the Autumn, as &s;oon as the corn crop was off, he ploughed his land in|to two-bout ridges, in which &s;tate it continued all winter; next &s;pring the&s;e ridges were ploughed, and harrowed until &s;ufficiently pulverized, and at la&s;t &s;plit to make a hollow furrow for depo&s;iting the dung, which was cover|ed in by the plough going twice about, making a ridge near four feet wide; then this two-bout ridge was har|rowed, a &s;ingle-wheel drill, turning round a hollow cylin|der of tin with holes in it, depo&s;ited the &s;eed directly over the dung: the drill had a &s;mall roller behind to cover in the &s;eed, and was drawn by one hor&s;e. When the plants were ready for hoeing, they were &s;et out at ten or twelve inches di&s;tance one from another, in the rows; and the intervals ploughed between through the Summer, as oft|en as nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From this place it is probable that the practice had tra|velled into Cumberland; for in the year 1755, Philip Howard, E&s;q. of Corby, fir&s;t cultivated turnips in that county, in drills with four feet intervals; finding the di&s;|tance too wide, he reduced it to two feet, and continued it for ten years before it was followed by the farmers, who now pur&s;ue the &s;ame mode with little variation, except that they make the di&s;tance of the intervals about twenty-&s;even inches. The one-bout ridges, in which the dung is depo&s;ited, are here called <HI>&s;titches,</HI> and are flattened at the top by drawing a piece of wood over them, in|&s;tead of a roller or a harrow.</P>
<P>About the year 1756, or 1757, Mr Pringle, formerly a &s;urgeon in the army, who had an e&s;tate near Cold&s;tream, in Berwick&s;hire, was the fir&s;t per&s;on in that neighbour|hood who cultivated turnips in this manner: His drills
<PB N="90" REF="105">were at three feet and a half di&s;tance. Mr Cox, a &s;erjeant, whom Mr Pringle brought home with him for a &s;ervant, &s;ays, that his ma&s;ter took his hints from Mr Tull's book, and that he al&s;o drilled all his corn crops, until he had overcome the annual weeds.</P>
<P>Mr William Daw&s;on, who was well acquainted with the turnip culture in England, having been purpo&s;ely &s;ent to re&s;ide in tho&s;e di&s;tricts for &s;ix or &s;even years where the be&s;t cultivation was pur&s;ued, with an intention not only of &s;eeing, but of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the manual ope|rations, and of every minutia in the practice, was convinc|ed of the &s;uperiority of Mr Pringle's mode over every o|ther he had &s;een, either in Norfolk or el&s;ewhere; and in 1762, when he entered to Frogden Farm, near Kel&s;o, in Roxburgh&s;hire, he immediately adopted the practice up|on a large &s;cale, to the amount of 100 acres yearly. He began by drilling at three feet di&s;tance; but a few years after, trying various widths of intervals, he re|duced it to two feet and a half, which he &s;till con|tinues. As far as we have been able to obtain informa|tion, he was the fir&s;t that u&s;ed <HI>a roller for flattening the</HI> tops of the one-bout ridges.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that Mr Pringle pur&s;ued this mode for &s;everal years, yet none of his neigh|bours followed the example; but no &s;ooner did Mr Daw|&s;on (an actual farmer) adopt the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, than it was immediately followed, not only by &s;everal farmers in his vicinity, but by tho&s;e very farmers adjoining Mr Pringle, who&s;e crops they had &s;een for ten or twelve years &s;o much &s;uperior to their own. It is al&s;o de&s;erving of notice, that when Mr Daw&s;on &s;ettled at Frogden, the whole of that di&s;trict was under the mo&s;t wretched &s;y&s;tem of cultivation, and the farmers unacquainted with the value of turnips, artificial gra&s;&s;es, and lime. At fir&s;t his practice met with many opponents, and was ridiculed by the old, the ignor|ant
<PB N="91" REF="106">ant, and the prejudiced; but his &s;uperior crops and pro|fits &s;oon made converts: The practice in a few years be|came general; and this di&s;trict is now among&s;t the be&s;t cultivated in the kingdom, the land trebled in value, and the a&s;pect of the country greatly improved. It is a plea&s;ing reflection, that the example and exertions of one man has been capable of producing &s;o great, &s;o la&s;ting, and ine&s;timable benefits; and it is more than probable, that this mode of cultivating turnips would have died a|way with Mr Pringle, and the practice been lo&s;t to this di&s;trict, had it not been for the di&s;cernment and intelli|gence of this individual.</P>
<P>We remember &s;eeing, about twenty-five years &s;ince, turnips cultivated in this manner, by Mr Chri&s;topher Ben|&s;on, of Stain&s;by, near Ripley, in York&s;hire, an ingenious gentleman, and great advocate for drilling, and who had drilled all his corn crops for many years: His nephew, Mr Donkin, informs us, that he had cultivated turnips in this manner, more than twenty years before this, which will be prior to the year 1750.</P>
<P>In Mr Ben&s;on's practice de&s;cribed by him&s;elf, in Dr Hunter's Georgical E&s;&s;ays, page 379, the &s;eed is drilled <HI>upon the dung,</HI> and that and the &s;eed covered together, by harrowing acro&s;s the ridges:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His nephew &s;ays "the dung and &s;eed were covered in by a double mould-board plough &s;et wide, and then harrowed."</NOTE> In this paper he very properly &s;ums up the advantages of this mode of cultivat|ing turnips; he ob&s;erves, "the &s;eed being placed upon the moi&s;t dung, will vegetate early in all circum&s;tances of the weather; and the manure being well covered, will be &s;ecured from evaporation in the hote&s;t &s;ea&s;ons: The turnips being placed immediately over the manure, have a ready pa&s;&s;age by means of their tap roots, into rich bed of nutriment, which will accelerate their growth, and in|crea&s;e their &s;ize. As the crop grows upon ridges, with a
<PB N="92" REF="107">trench on each &s;ide, it is obvious that the turnips will re|main dry in the wette&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, a circum&s;tance of the ut|mo&s;t utility: To tho&s;e advantages we may add, the <HI>doub|ling of the &s;oil,</HI> which I con&s;ider as an important article in all &s;ituations where the <HI>&s;taple of the land happens to be thin."</HI></P>
<P>From a review of the whole it appears, that the pre|&s;ent mode of cultivating turnips, by drilling in rows at two feet and two feet and a half di&s;tance, had occurred to different people in different parts, who all, at fir&s;t, began according to Mr Tull's directions, with the addition of dung put in the bottom of the ridge; and after trying various width of intervals, found that the be&s;t and mo&s;t convenient di&s;tance was from twenty-four to thirty inches; but it is very clear that <HI>Mr Tull is the root from whence this excellent practice fir&s;t originated.</HI></P>
<P>This mode of cultivating turnips, is now &s;preading far and wide, with great rapidity; be&s;ides this county, it is al&s;o the general practice of Roxburgh&s;hire and Berwick|&s;hire, and has been lately adopted by the be&s;t cultivators in various di&s;tricts of Scotland, as well as different parts of England; among&s;t which the county of Norfolk will par|ticularly pro&s;it by it, as a fir&s;t-rate cultivator who holds a large farm in that county, has procured the proper appara|tus from hence, and &s;ent his &s;on to be in&s;tructed in the different operations; it has al&s;o found its way into Dor|&s;et&s;hire; we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s by the ingenious Mr Bo&s;well of Piddletown; and to the farmers of Devon&s;hire, it has been particularly recommended, as the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem known, by the cele|brated Mr Mar&s;hall, who has minutely examined, and is well acquainted with the agriculture of the greate&s;t part of the kingdom.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman has publi&s;hed the Rural Economy of Nor-folk, York&s;hire, Midland Counties, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, the We&s;t of England, &amp;c.</NOTE>&mdash;And the Pre&s;ident of the Board adds,

We find, that where corn is drilled, and the intervals hoed, it pulverizes the &s;oil, and makes the fine&s;t preparation for gra&s;s &s;eeds of all others: where this is properly done, and harrowed once acro&s;s, after the &s;eeds are &s;own, they &s;eldom or never mi&s;s; long experience having proved, that nothing requires a finer tilth than clover and gra&s;s &s;eeds:&mdash;Upon the be&s;t &s;oils, the clover and ray-gra&s;s mixed, are generally ready to depa&s;ture with fat &s;heep by the beginning of April, and from May, through the Summer, will carry &s;ix or eight &s;heep per acre, according to the luxuriance of the crop and fertility of the &s;oil; the &s;econd and remaining years, they are depa&s;tured by the &s;tore flock. The&s;e pa&s;tures are frequently mown when the ray-gra&s;s begins to flow|er, which not only increa&s;es the bottom gra&s;s, but a quantity of excellent hay is obtained, of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>When the clovers are not depa&s;tured, but kept for hay, they are generally mown about the latter end of June; the average produce about 2 tons per acre. The &s;econd crop is rarely cut for hay, but depa&s;tured by cattle or &s;heep, chiefly the latter: When cattle are put into a fre&s;h clover "fog," e&s;pecially in wet weather, they &s;ometimes hove, by the &s;udden fermentation of the clover; to pre|vent this inconvenience, cattle are put upon it in the mid|dle of the day, when it is free from dew or any moi&s;ture, they being fir&s;t filled with natural gra&s;s, which hinders them from eating &s;o greedily, as if put on hungry; if the clover once pa&s;s, they &s;eldom take any harm after|wards:
<PB N="99" REF="114">by u&s;ing this precaution, we have not had any cattle hoven, for &s;everal years.&mdash;When very much &s;welled, an in&s;trument is u&s;ed, (&s;imilar to that u&s;ed by &s;ur|geons in tapping for the drop&s;y) it is &s;o contrived, that after being thru&s;t in between the hip and rib, (on the near &s;ide) one part pulls out, while a tube remains in the ori|fice, thro' which an amazing quantity of fetid air e&s;capes, and relieves the animal; but they are very apt to hove again afterwards.</P>
<P>We have heard of hoven cattle being relieved, by giv|ing them an egg &s;hell full of tar.</P>
<P>The practice of keeping hor&s;es in the hou&s;e, &s;heds, or fold-yards, all Summer, upon <HI>cut clover, tares, &amp;c.</HI> was introduced into this county, about the year 1770; it is now generally adopted by the be&s;t farmers, who find their hor&s;es thrive better; are cheaper kept than depa&s;|turing at large; and al&s;o, that a quantity of manure is gained by this means, which otherwi&s;e would have been in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t, or of very little u&s;e; as the dung of hor&s;es, when dropped in pa&s;tures, is mo&s;tly de&s;troyed by in&s;ects, in the Summer &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;An acre of good clo|ver u&s;ed in this manner, will keep from 2 to 3 hor&s;es, from the beginning of June till the end of October, a|bout 20 weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Saintfoin, Lucern, and Chicory,</HI> have been tried on a &s;mall &s;cale, but do not &s;eem to come into general u&s;e; the crops of clover being thought more valuable.</P>
<P>In order to draw any fair comparative value between the produce of old gra&s;s lands and artificial gra&s;&s;es, the &s;oil and &s;ituation ought to be exactly alike, and experi|ments accurately conducted; for want of &s;uch data, no ju&s;t conclu&s;ions can be made; but we believe, that gener|al ob&s;ervation and experience have e&s;tabli&s;hed an opinion, that the &s;ame lands which in a &s;tate of old gra&s;s carried 3 &s;heep an acre, will, for the fir&s;t year of clover and ray|gra&s;s,

<P>For the purpo&s;e of drawing it together to be put into pikes, or ricklets, it is either cocked, or put into large

<P>The profit of grazing, like all other &s;peculations, varies with circum&s;tances; but we believe we may venture to a|verage it at 3l. or 3l. 10s. for keeping on gra&s;s from May-day to Michaelmas. Cows, in general, leave more than oxen, in proportion to their weight; but they are &s;ubject to di&s;orders of the udder, that frequently reduce the profit, and deter many people from grazing them.</P>
<P>Some few graziers follow the old cu&s;tom of keeping on|ly one kind of &s;tock upon the &s;ame ground; whil&s;t others, we think with more propriety, intermix with oxen and cows, a few &s;heep, and two or three colts in each pa&s;ture; which both turn to good account, and do little injury to the grazing cattle: In &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;heep are a real benefit, by eating down and de&s;troying the ragwort <HI>(Senecio

<P><HI>Sheep,</HI> that have been wintered upon turnips, are put to the earlie&s;t gra&s;s that can be obtained; the clovers and ray-gra&s;s are generally ready in April; the old gra&s;s lands not before May: In both &s;ituations they are continued till &s;horn, and &s;old off, from the latter end of May, thro' all June and part of July, from 2l. to 2l. 15s. each. In 1797 the prices were from 2l. 10s. to 3l. 10s each: The draft ewes, or &s;hearling wethers intended for turnips next Winter, &s;ucceed them, and thus a regular rotation is kept up. Of late years, &s;ome farmers have &s;old their &s;hearling wethers in July, (when only 15 months old) to the butch|ers, for as high prices, as from 30 to 35 &s;hillings each. In 1796, they &s;old from 40 to 45 &s;hillings each; and in 1797, as high as 50 &s;hillings, after &s;hearing a fleece worth 6 &s;hillings.</P>
<P>A large portion of the lands of this county being liable to the rot, and un&s;afe for a breeding flock, the occupiers of &s;uch &s;ituations, venture ewes for fat lambs for one year; the&s;e are bought in the Autumn, put to tup early, (&s;ome in Augu&s;t) the lambs &s;old in May, June, and July; after which the ewes are fatted, and &s;old in October and Nov|ember.&mdash;Such lambs as are early, and go off in May, oft|en &s;ell for 20 &s;hillings each; but the others average at a|bout 12s. 6d.

<P>Mr Hay of Le&s;bury, and Mr Wat&s;on of Waren, not having &s;o ready a market for the great quantities of bran, pollard and oat-chimmings, which their exten&s;ive manu|factures of flour and oat-meal produce, have applied it to feeding different kinds of &s;tock; they both agree that for feeding pigs, it is of little value; one of the gentlemen &s;ays, that from &s;ome experiments he had read, he was in|duced to enter largely on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and per&s;evered in it, till he lo&s;t upwards of a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><HI>For Hor&s;es</HI>&mdash;they both think it very valuable along with hay or &s;traw, in&s;tead of corn; Mr Wat&s;on allows his hor&s;es 6 bu&s;hels of bran, or 4 bu&s;hels of pollard, and 2 of
<PB N="105" REF="120">oat &s;eeds per week, the average price of which is about 5 &s;hillings; the hor&s;es are in high condition, and &s;leek as ravens, but not more &s;o than tho&s;e that have 2&frac15; bu&s;hels of oats per week, the price of which at 2s. per bu&s;hel is equal to the value of the bran.</P>
<P><HI>For Cattle</HI>&mdash;Mr Hay &s;ays, that "in the beginning of October, I tie up my cattle in &s;heds, and place before every bea&s;t a crib for bran, and another for turnips, and to each give a peck of <HI>pollard,</HI> morning and evening, with <HI>full allowance of turnips,</HI> well clean&s;ed and topped; I fre|quently mix oat &s;heeling &s;eeds and oat du&s;t, which makes them fonder of the pollard, if &s;tale or old kept. Three months &s;tall-feeding in this way is equal to 6 months in the u&s;ual way."</P>
<P>In order to form &s;ome idea of the utility of the above mode, we mu&s;t e&s;timate the expence of the pollard, in ad|dition to the full allowance of turnips: pollard being a finer kind of bran, is &s;old for 2d. a bu&s;hel more; of cour&s;e when bran is 10d. per bu&s;hel, pollard will be 1s. and al|lowing that an ox will fatten as much in 10 weeks with the above keeping, as he will in 20 by the common mode, the account will &s;tand thus:</P>

<P>THE <HI>commons</HI>&mdash;in this county capable of being convert|ed into profitable tillage land are now very trifling, the greate&s;t part having been inclo&s;ed within the la&s;t thirty years; the whole amounting to near 120,000 acres. Of this, the commons belonging to the manors of Hexham|&s;hire and Allendale contain 50,000 acres, a great part (35,000) of which are high, expo&s;ed, heathy mountains. The&s;e are to be converted into &s;tinted pa&s;tures, not being thought capable of any other improvement.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ed value of &s;uch inclo&s;ed commons, depends (as we have &s;tated in our Report of Cumberland) entirely upon the &s;y&s;tem of cultivation pur&s;ued. Upon Bulbeck-common there are lands which, in a &s;tate of common, were not worth more than 1s. an acre, a part of which has been in tillage twenty-five years, and grown three white crops &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, betwixt one fallowing and another. This land is now dear enough at 4s. an acre; while Mr Hop|per's of Black-Hedley, is worth 10s. or 12s. His &s;y&s;tem is, when fir&s;t broke up from heath, to pare and burn, and plough in the autumn; next &s;pring plough acro&s;s, lime and &s;ow oats; then fallow and lime, 75 bu&s;hels per acre, and &s;ow turnips; after which, oats and gra&s;s &s;eeds, four pounds red clover, five pounds white, and one bu&s;hel of ray gra&s;s, and continue in gra&s;s &s;ix or &s;even years; then to plough for oats&mdash;turnips&mdash;oats&mdash;and &s;ow up with gra&s;s &s;eeds as before. There are in&s;tances, where the increa&s;ed value is in the ratio of twelve to one, or even more; but
<PB N="111" REF="126">the&s;e are, where the commons were of no value to the proprietor, which is in general the ca&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;tinted common of Holy I&s;land was divided in 1790, the allotments that were gotten for a right, which never let for more than 2l. are now let for 14l. or 15l. per ann. and in a few years will be worth upwards of 20l.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>The extent of wa&s;te lands</HI>&mdash;or open mountainous di&s;|tricts, incapable of affording profit by cultivating with the plough, is very great, as we have before &s;tated; con&s;i|derable quantities of which are private property, and of cour&s;e may be depa&s;tured by &s;heep or other &s;tock to the greate&s;t advantage; of tho&s;e that are common, it would certainly be be&s;t for every man to know his own &s;hare.</P>

<P>DRAINING&mdash;is one of tho&s;e improvements that has lately made its way into Northumberland, and is now mo&s;tly practi&s;ed in the middle and northern parts of the county; the theory is pretty well under&s;tood in tho&s;e di&s;|tricts, and the practice is becoming more prevalent every year. Hollow drains are generally u&s;ed, filled with &s;tones, where they can be got; where the&s;e cannot be obtained,

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2</HI>&mdash;Paring and Burning.</HEAD>
<P>Paring and Burning is not much practi&s;ed in the ea&s;tern and northern parts of the county; in the midland and &s;outhern parts it is mo&s;t prevalent, but even there it is confined to old &s;wards, and coar&s;e, rough, ru&s;hey and heathy lands; for the fir&s;t breaking-up of &s;uch ground, it is certainly very convenient, and preferable to any other mode we have ever &s;een; but tho' we are fully con|vinced of its beneficial effects in &s;uch &s;ituations, yet we have our doubts whether it could be u&s;ed with advantage upon lands that have lain a few years in gra&s;s, and that would produce good crops of grain <HI>immediately on being ploughed out,</HI> which is not the ca&s;e with coar&s;e, rough, heathy lands, or even very old &s;wards on rich fertile &s;oils; it being found that crops on the latter, are frequently very much injured by <HI>"leaping"</HI> for two or three years; which paring and burning entirely obviates, and en&s;ures full crops to the farmer; who need not be under any ap|prehen&s;ion of his &s;oil being ruined by it, provided he pur&s;ues the following cour&s;e:&mdash;

<ITEM>2. Oats.&mdash;</ITEM>

&s;own up with clover and gra&s;s &s;eeds, and depa&s;tured with &s;heep for three or four years, and afterwards (if not intended to lie in gra&s;s) continue it in the rotation mentioned page 64: It is the <HI>injudicious cropping,</HI> more than the ill effects derived from paring and burning, that has been the chief cau&s;e of bringing &s;uch an odium on this practice, which is certain|ly an excellent one in <HI>&s;ome &s;ituations,</HI> and <HI>properly conducted;</HI> but like the fermented juice of the grape, may be too oft|en repeated and improperly applied.</P>
<P>The popular clamour again&s;t this practice, "that it <HI>de|&s;troys the &s;oil,</HI>" we can by no means admit; and are inclin|ed
<PB N="113" REF="128">to believe, that not a &s;ingle atom of &s;oil is ab&s;tracted, though the bulk of the &s;od or turf be dimini&s;hed: this ari&s;es from the burning of the roots or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, which, by this proce&s;s afford a con&s;iderable portion of Alkaline Salts, phlogi&s;tic or carbonic matter, and pro|bably other principles friendly to vegetation; as we find tho&s;e a&s;hes produce abundant crops of turnips, which fatten, &s;tock much quicker than tho&s;e after any other dre&s;&s;ing or manure we have ever &s;een, and the &s;uc|ceeding crops of corn are &s;o very luxuriant, as to tempt the <HI>injudicious cultivator</HI> to pur&s;ue it too far; and for the &s;ake of temporary gain, may be &s;aid to rip it up, as the boy did with his goo&s;e that layed golden eggs.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 3.&mdash;<HI>Manuring.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In &s;ome parts of this county, where the turnip culture is carried to &s;uch extent, every exertion of ingenuity is practi&s;ed to rai&s;e a large portion of <HI>Farm Yard Dung:</HI> for without this valuable article, it is well known that good turnip crops are not to be expected, and the farmers of &s;trong &s;oils are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the advantage of dung to their crops, not to u&s;e every endeavour to increa&s;e its quantity.</P>
<P>The farmers of turnip &s;oils, in order to have their dung &s;ufficiently rotted, lead it out of the fold yard in the win|ter, make it up in large dunghills in order to increa&s;e the putrefactive proce&s;s, and prepare it for that &s;tate of di&s;&s;o|lution, by which its component parts are ready to be a&s;&s;imilated into new bodies; and in which &s;tate only, is can be of u&s;e in vegetation.</P>
<P>Upon the hill-farms around Cheviot, we have been oft|en &s;urprized, to &s;ee at the doors of the &s;hepherds' hou&s;es, &s;uch immen&s;e dunghills, the accumulation of unnumber|ed years, probably centuries: to avoid this increa&s;ing nui&s;ance, many of them have <HI>ingeniou&s;ly contrived</HI> to build
<PB N="114" REF="129">their hou&s;es near a <HI>"Burn &s;ide"</HI> for the <HI>convenience</HI> of having it <HI>taken away by every flood:</HI> notwith&s;tanding they have lands adjoining, upon which, if this manure was pro|perly applied, the greate&s;t improvements would en&s;ue, and con&s;iderable quantities of excellent hay be produced, for the &s;upport of the flocks in winter &s;torms, in which &s;ea&s;ons they are very often under the nece&s;&s;ity of pur|cha&s;ing hay in the Lowlands, and of having it conveyed on hor&s;e-back to the top of the&s;e hills in the deepe&s;t &s;nows, at a very great expence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were glad to &s;ee Mr Smith, Mr Mar&s;hall, and a few o|thers, departing from this trait of barbari&s;m, and applying their manure in a very proper manner.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Lime</HI>&mdash;is found in many parts of this county, of an ex|cellent quality. In Bambro' Ward, where it has been long u&s;ed, many intelligent farmers begin to doubt of its efficacy, and the propriety of continuing to lay it upon their <HI>old tillage lands.</HI> Upon the dry &s;oils in Glendale Ward, where it has not been u&s;ed much above 40 years,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr James Hall of Thornington, was the fir&s;t per&s;on that ever carried a cart load of lime acro&s;s the river Till, for laying upon land: The fir&s;t year he prevailed upon his father to allow him to lead 10 cart load, which had &s;o wonderful an effect, that the quantity was increa&s;ed next year, and in a few years after, the u&s;e of it became general.</NOTE> its effects are more con&s;picuous, e&s;pecially upon &s;uch lands as have been &s;eldom or never limed. In its natural &s;tate, the &s;oil of this di&s;trict is dry, duffy, light, full of fibrous, roots, and when in fallow, on pa&s;&s;ing over it, you &s;ink to the ancles; after being &s;ufficiently limed, the fibrous roots di&s;appear, the &s;oil becomes den&s;er, firm to the tread, retentive of moi&s;ture, and produces better and more abun|dant crops of grain than before: when laid to gra&s;s, the effects of the lime appear to an inch, by the &s;uperior ver|dure
<PB N="115" REF="130">which takes place as far as it has gone.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About twelve years &s;ince, when looking over the farm of Thornington, with Mr James Hall, (the late tenant) we were &s;ur|pri&s;ed with the &s;udden alteration in the verdure of the land, which took place immediately at the junction of two ridges, one &s;ide was a fine dark green, <HI>caten very bare,</HI> and covered with a thick mat of <HI>white clover and ray-gra&s;s;</HI> the other was a dingy brown, principally compo&s;ed of <HI>fine bent,</HI> and <HI>&s;heep's fe&s;que,</HI> and in a great mea&s;ure <HI>neglected by the &s;heep:</HI> An explanation was de&s;ired for &s;o great a contra&s;t, and Mr Hall informed us, that when this parcel of land was la&s;t in fallow, the part which was <HI>eaten &s;o bare,</HI> and looked &s;o green, was <HI>well limed;</HI> the other, which the &s;heep neg|lected, had <HI>never been limed.</HI>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and repeatedly copied by writers on Agricul|ture and Botany, that <HI>"&s;heep prefer the "Fe&s;tuca Ovina" to all other plants:"</HI> In the above in&s;tance, it was quite the contrary; from which, and from other ob&s;ervations we have made, we are inclined to believe, that the idea has probably originated more in conjecture than experiment. It has al&s;o been remarked by bo|tanical writers, that &s;heep refu&s;e to eat ragwort, <HI>(Senecio Ja|cobaea:")</HI> The fact in, they are &s;o very fond of it, they will not allow a plant to flower wherever they depa&s;ture.</P></NOTE> Many of the&s;e dry &s;oils, after being limed, grow white clover na|turally; where not limed, it &s;eldom appears; but they cover principally with <HI>agro&s;tis capillaris</HI> (fine bent,) which is &s;eldom eaten by any kind of &s;tock, if they can get o|ther food: When land has been &s;ufficiently limed, this plant di&s;appears; and wherever it is found, it may be &s;afely concluded, that the &s;oil on which it grows has not had its due quantity of lime.</P>
<P>About &s;even years &s;ince Mr George Reed, of South-Middleton near Wooler, cleared from broom, 30 or 40 acres of light, dry, channelly &s;oil, that had <HI>never been limed,</HI> which was &s;own with rye; the rye &s;tubble was ploughed in the Autumn, and the wor&s;t part of it limed at the rate of 100 bu&s;hels per acre; next Summer the whole was drilled with turnips (dunged &amp;c. as de&s;cribed page 89) which came up all alike, and continued to do e|qually well for three or four weeks; but little or no rain falling in that period, and the weather continuing droughty, tho&s;e turnips upon the land which had <HI>no lime,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="131">died away; whil&s;t tho&s;e upon that part which <HI>was limed</HI> were di&s;cernible <HI>to an inch,</HI> flouri&s;hed with unabated vigour, and produced an excellent crop, (for &s;uch land) worth at lea&s;t 4l 10s. an acre; many &s;imilar in&s;tances might be produced, but this is the mo&s;t &s;triking we re|collect to have noted.</P>
<P><HI>The made of burning lime,</HI> in this county, is mo&s;tly in draw-kilns, of the form of an inverted cone, with two or three eyes or mouths for drawing out the lime, and ad|mitting air: The&s;e kilns are kept burning and drawing perpetually. Some of the large &s;ale kilns will afford 40 or 50 cart load a day: A cart load of coals is reckoned to burn two cart loads of lime.</P>
<P><HI>The Price,</HI> at the kilns, is from 3s. to 4s. 6d. for 25 upheaped bu&s;hels.</P>
<P><HI>The Quantity,</HI> laid upon an acre, is from 75 to 150 bu&s;hels.</P>
<P><HI>The general practice of u&s;ing lime,</HI> is to lay it up in heaps of three or four cart loads each; and as &s;oon as the clods are fallen, &s;lacked, or reduced to the &s;tate of quick-lime, it is &s;pread evenly upon the land, and harrowed and ploughed in as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after: &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of laying it up in heaps of 3 or 4 cart loads each, it is laid upon the land in the clod &s;tate, in little heaps of about a bu&s;hel each, which are covered with earth until &s;ufficient|ly flacked or fallen, and then &s;pread abroad.</P>
<P>In either mode, or in whatever manner lime is applied, it certainly has the greate&s;t effect, when both it and the &s;oil are in the mo&s;t pulverized &s;tate.</P>
<P>Upon the turnip &s;oils where very large quantities of lime are u&s;ed, it would be extremely difficult to get a &s;ufficiency in the early part of Summer, previous to the turnip &s;ea&s;on; in &s;uch &s;ituations, it is u&s;ual to lead as much as po&s;&s;ible thro' the Summer and Autumn, which
<PB N="117" REF="132">is laid up in very large heaps (from 50 to 150 loads each) and before Winter covered with &s;ods, or thatched with &s;traw, to prevent the rain from penetrating it: If well &s;e|cured, it is found in a very quick &s;tate, in the Spring, &s;ome|times a great portion of it remaining un&s;lacked.</P>
<P>The opinions re&s;pecting the good or ill effects of lime, are exceedingly various; &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that it can never be u&s;ed in too large a quantity; whil&s;t others contend, it is of no u&s;e whatever: Our own practice authorizes us to &s;ay, that upon &s;ome &s;oils, the application of lime, (or calca|reous earth in &s;ome other form) in con&s;iderable quantities, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to bring them to their mo&s;t fertile &s;tate, and to prepare them for the action of other manures; whil&s;t upon other &s;oils, lime produces no &s;en|&s;ible effect, and if u&s;ed in large quantities, will prove very detrimental.&mdash;Thus may one of the mo&s;t valuable appli|cations we know, for the improvement of many &s;oils, be condemned, by tho&s;e who draw <HI>po&s;itive conclu&s;ions,</HI> from <HI>partial ob&s;ervations of facts.</HI> The practice of paring and burning, we believe, owes the opprobrium, which &s;ome have thrown upon it, to <HI>a &s;imilar mode of rea&s;oning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stone Marl,</HI> has formerly been u&s;ed in con&s;iderable quantities, near Tweed&s;ide, but the more immediate effects of lime have entirely &s;et a&s;ide the u&s;e of &s;tone marl.</P>
<P><HI>Shell Marl</HI> is u&s;ed with great advantage, at the rate of 20 or 30 cart loads an acre, on the farms of Wark, Sun|nylaws, and Learmouth.</P>
<P><HI>Sea Wrack, Sea Ware, or Marine Plants</HI>&mdash;driven a|&s;hore by the tide, are u&s;ed with great effect, wherever they can be had. Of the&s;e the <HI>fucus ve&s;iculo&s;us,</HI> and its rela|tives <HI>F. &s;erratus and inflatus,</HI> (Skeir Ware) are not held in much e&s;timation, and when u&s;ed, require to be laid up in large heaps to putrify. If laid upon the land, as the others
<PB N="118" REF="133">are, when taken immediately from the &s;hore, they dry, and turn to a black coriaceous &s;ub&s;tane. The <HI>fucus digitatus</HI> (Wa&s;&s;els) is the great favourite, and another &s;pecies called <HI>May-weed,</HI> which we cannot point out by its Linnaean name, not having had an opportunity of &s;eeing it, but from the de&s;criptions we have heard, &s;u&s;pect it to be the young plants of the <HI>fucus digitatus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coal A&s;hes</HI>&mdash;are chiefly u&s;ed in the vicinity of the prin|cipal towns, as a dre&s;&s;ing for gra&s;s land; for this purpo&s;e they are found of con&s;iderable benefit, e&s;pecially upon &s;trong, coar&s;e, and wet lands.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 1.&mdash;<HI>Cattle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE different kinds of cattle bred in this county are the &s;hort horned&mdash;the Devon&s;hire&mdash;the long-horned&mdash;and the wild cattle.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;hort horned kind</HI> have been long e&s;tabli&s;hed over the whole county, the other kinds are found only in the hands of a few individuals, who have introduced them with a laudable view of comparing their merits with the e&s;tabli&s;hed breed of the country.&mdash;They differ from the o|ther breeds, in the &s;hortne&s;s of their horns, and in being wider and thicker in their form, con&s;equently feed to the mo&s;t weight; in affording the greate&s;t quantity of tal|low when fatted, in having very thin hides, and much le&s;s hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probably from the thinne&s;s of their hides and hair, that they are accounted tenderer than mo&s;t other breeds.</NOTE> upon them than any other breed (the Alderneys excepted); but the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference con&s;i&s;ts in the quantity of milk they give beyond mo&s;t other breeds: there being in&s;tances of cows giving 36 quarts of milk per day, and of 48 firkins of butter being made from a dairy of 12 cows: but the more general quantity is 3 fir|kins per cow in a &s;ea&s;on, and 24 quarts of milk per day:
<PB N="122" REF="137">Their colour is much varied, but they mo&s;tly are an agreeable mixture of red and white. From their being in many places called the Dutch breed, it is probable they were originally brought from the Continent.</P>
<P>They have been much improved of late years, by the exertions and attention of enterpri&s;ing breeders; who have already improved them &s;o far, as to be &s;old fat to the butchers at 3&frac12; years old. The weight of the carca&s;e is in general from 60 to 80 &s;tone, (14 lb. to the &s;tone) but there are in&s;tances of individuals attaining much greater weight.</P>
<P>Sir H. Grey bred and fed two &s;even-years old oxen that weighed 152 &s;tone 9 lb. the four quarters only; and a &s;payed heifer, 132 &s;tone, 6 lb. ditto. Mr Smith of Tog&s;tone, a cow, 127 &s;tone 11 lb. ditto.</P>
<P>But large &s;ize is not now con&s;idered as an excellence: Quick &s;eeders, that lay their &s;at upon the mo&s;t valuable parts, and have the lea&s;t offal in the coar&s;e parts, are the kind which every enlightened breeder wi&s;hes to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of.</P>
<P><HI>The long Horns</HI> have been introduced from the improv|ed &s;tocks of the Midland counties, at different times and by different breeders; but have in mo&s;t in&s;tances given way again to the improved breed of &s;hort horns.</P>
<P><HI>The Devon&s;hire breed</HI> is only in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Walter Trevelyan, E&s;q. of Nether Witton, who introduced them about three years &s;ince; their offspring has not yet got to a proper age to form a judgment of their comparative merits.</P>
<P><HI>The Wild Cattle</HI>&mdash;are only found in Chillingham Park, belonging to the Earl of Tankerville; and as it is probable they are the only remains of the <HI>true and genuine</HI> breed of

<PB N="123" REF="139">that &s;pecies of cattle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are no &s;trangers that there may be found in two or three different Parks of the kingdom, breeds of cattle which pa&s;s under the denomination of Wild Cattle; but are inclined to believe that they have been contaminated by cro&s;&s;ing, and that tho&s;e in Chillingham Park are the only remains, which an&s;wer the de&s;crip|tion given by <HI>Boethius,</HI> of this &s;pecies of cattle.</NOTE> we &s;hall be more particular in our de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Their colour is invariably white, muzzle black; the whole of the in&s;ide of the ear, and about one third of the out&s;ide from the tip, downwards, red; horns white, with black tips, very fine, and bent upwards. Some of the bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and an half, or two inches long. The weight of the oxen is from 35 to 45 &s;tone, and the cows from 25 to 35 &s;tone, the four quarters; 14 lb. to the &s;tone. The beef is fine|ly marbled, and of excellent flavour.</P>
<P>From the nature of their pa&s;ture, and the frequent agitation they are put into, by the curio&s;ity of &s;trangers, it cannot be expected they &s;hould get very fat; yet the &s;ix years old oxen are generally very good beef. From whence it may be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed, that in proper &s;itua|tions, they would feed well.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t appearance of any per&s;on they &s;et off in full gallop; and, at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred yards, make a wheel round, and come boldly up again, to&s;ting their heads in a menacing manner; on a &s;udden they make a full &s;top, at the di&s;tance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of their &s;urprize; but upon the lea&s;t motion being made, they all again turn round, and gallop off again with equal &s;peed, but not to the &s;ame di&s;tance: forming a &s;horter circle, and again returning with a bolder, and more threatening a&s;pect than before; they approach much nearer, probably within thirty yards, when they make another &s;tand, and again gallop off: this they do &s;everal times, &s;hortening their
<PB N="124" REF="140">in&s;tance, and advancing nearer; till they come within a few yards, when mo&s;t people think it prudent to leave them, not chu&s;ing to provoke them further, as it is pro|bable, that in a few turns more they would make an at|tack.</P>
<P>The mode of killing them was, perhaps, the only mo|dern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting. On notice been given, that a wild bull would be killed upon a certain day, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted, and armed with guns, &amp;c. &s;ometimes to the number of an hundred hor&s;e, and four or five hundred foot, who &s;tood upon walls or got into trees, while the hor&s;emen rode off the bull from the re&s;t of the herd, un|til he &s;tood at bay; when a mark&s;man di&s;mounted and &s;hot. At &s;ome of the&s;e huntings, twenty or thirty &s;hots have been fired before he was &s;ubdued: on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, the bleeding victim grew de&s;perately furious, from the &s;marting of his wounds, and the &s;houts of &s;avage joy that were echoing from every &s;ide: from the number of accidents that happened, this dangerous mode has been &s;eldom practi&s;ed of late years; the park-keeper alone generally &s;hooting them with a rifled gun, at one &s;hot.&mdash;When the cows calve, they hide their calves, for a week or ten days, in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation, and go and &s;uckle them two or three times a day. If any per&s;on come near the calves, they clap their heads clo&s;e to the ground, and lie like a hare in form, to hide them&s;elves. This is a proof of their native wildne&s;s, and is corroborated by the following circum&s;tance, that happened to the writer of this narrative, who found a hidden calf, two days old, very lean, and very weak; on &s;troking its head, it got up, pawed two or three times like an old bull, bellowed very loud, retired a few &s;teps, and bolted at his legs with all its force; it then began to paw again, bellowed, &s;tep|ped back, and bolted as before: but knowing its inten|tion,
<PB N="125" REF="141">and &s;tepping a&s;ide, it mi&s;&s;ed me, fell, and was &s;o very weak, that it could not ri&s;e, though it made &s;everal efforts; but it had done enough, the whole herd were alarmed, and coming to its re&s;cue, obliged me to retire; for the dams will allow no per&s;on to touch their calves without attacking them with impetuous ferocity.</P>
<P>When any one happens to be wounded, or grown weak and feeble through age or &s;ickne&s;s, the re&s;t of the herd &s;et upon it, and gore it to death.</P>
<P><HI>Dairy.</HI>&mdash;This county cannot boa&s;t of its dairies; tho&s;e who live in the vicinity of Newca&s;tle, and other populous places, make a hand&s;ome return by the &s;ale of milk, fre&s;h butter, &amp;c. but upon mo&s;t of the large farms in this coun|ty, dairies are not held in much e&s;timation.</P>
<P><HI>Breeding young cattle</HI>&mdash;is practi&s;ed in almo&s;t every part of the county. Upon the large farms, cows are kept more for this purpo&s;e than the profit of dairying: there are in|&s;tances of 50 or 60 calves being brought up in one &s;ea&s;on, by one farmer, who did not milk more than fifteen cows. Calves are certainly be&s;t reared with milk, but where &s;uch numbers are bred, many different things have been mixed with, or &s;ub&s;tituted for, this nutritive and natural diet; oats and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an meal, oil cake, lint&s;eed, boiled turnips, &amp;c. are u&s;ed, and have their various advocates; but lint|&s;eed is mo&s;t approved; eggs are excellent for mixing in the calf's food; when cheap in the Spring, perhaps they cannot be better employed. In the Summer the calves are turned to gra&s;s, and in the fir&s;t Winter get turnips and &s;traw. After being a year old, they are kept in Sum|mer on coar&s;e pa&s;ture; and in Winter on &s;traw only.</P>
<P><HI>Hiring Bulls</HI>&mdash;for the &s;ea&s;on, is practi&s;ed in this coun|ty; as high as 50 guineas have been paid for a bull of the &s;hort-horned breed, for one &s;ea&s;on, and from 3 to 5 guineas given, for &s;erving a cow; but the more common premium is a guinea.</P>

<P>In this county there are three di&s;tinct breeds.&mdash;The Cheviot &s;heep, the Heath &s;heep, and the long-wooled &s;heep.</P>
<P><HI>The Cheviot &s;heep</HI>&mdash;are hornle&s;s, the faces and legs in general white.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many of the Cheviot &s;heep have dark faces, and were more &s;o formerly. We were informed by Mr Chi&s;holm, Mr Readhead, Mr Mar&s;hall, &amp;c. that the&s;e dark-faced ones grew equally as fine wool. were as hardy, and equally as good thrivers as the white-faced ones; but that the people to whom they &s;old their &s;heep, and e&s;pecially tups, preferred white faces; for which rea|&s;on, they have endeavoured to get quit of black faces.</NOTE> The <HI>be&s;t breeds</HI> have a &s;ine open coun|tenance, with lively prominent eyes; body long, fore quarters wanting depth in the brea&s;t, and breadth both there and on the chine; fine clean &s;mall boned legs; thin pelts, weight of carca&s;e when fat, from 12 to 18 lb. per quarter; fleeces from 2&frac12; to 3&frac12; lb each, and &s;old in 1792, for 11d. per lb. The wool is not all &s;ine, there being in a fleece of 3 lb. weight, only 2 lb. of &s;ine wool, worth one &s;hilling per lb. (when the whole fleece &s;ells at 10d. per lb.) and one pound of coar&s;e, worth only 6 d. per lb.</P>
<P>They are bred only upon the hilly di&s;tricts in the north|we&s;t part of the county, and do not extend much farther &s;outh than Reedwater.</P>

<P>The &s;hape of this breed of &s;heep has been much im|proved of late years; but all tho&s;e who have been aiding in making &s;uch improvements, readily acknowledge,
<PB N="128" REF="146">there is &s;till much to be done; e&s;pecially to the fore quar|ter, which they all agree is very defective; but we hope it will not long remain &s;o, as we think we &s;ee a &s;pirit of in|ve&s;tigation ari&s;ing among&s;t the&s;e breeders, that in a few years will remedy not only this defect, but will di&s;cover others, which at pre&s;ent they are not willing to admit. But as knowledge is progre&s;&s;ive, we cannot expect the perfection of this breed of &s;heep can be obtained at once; it mu&s;t proceed by &s;low gradations, as every other im|provement hath done; it is a great point gained, that we admit defects, and are de&s;irous to amend them.</P>
<P>That breed of &s;heep which brings the mo&s;t profit to the farmer, will always be pur&s;ued by him, whatever his &s;ituation; but that object, we pre&s;ume, is not to be ob|tained in this di&s;trict from <HI>fine wool alone.</HI> Perfect moun|tain &s;heep &s;hould be <HI>active, hardy, well formed,</HI> and <HI>quick &s;eeders:</HI> the&s;e qualities will always recommend them to the grazier, who will never purcha&s;e a &s;low feeding ani|mal, while he can get one of a different &s;ort, though at a con&s;iderable advanced price. But if to the&s;e qualities, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ale of a mountain farmer's &s;tock, can be added a <HI>fleece of fine wool,</HI> a breed of &s;heep would then be obtained, the propere&s;t for a hilly di&s;trict of any we have yet &s;een. There is little doubt but this may be accompli&s;h|ed by <HI>proper &s;election;</HI> and probably the <HI>be&s;t kind</HI> of Cheviot &s;heep, from their hardine&s;s, and producing a portion of fine wool, are the propere&s;t &s;tock for laying the founda|tion of &s;o de&s;irable an improvement.</P>

<P><HI>The Mode of Management</HI>&mdash;among&s;t the &s;heep farmers of the&s;e hills, is to divide their flock into different parcels, viz. lambs, hogs, gimmers, ewes, and wethers, and each parcel kept on &s;uch pa&s;turage as is thought mo&s;t proper for them. Every parcel is attended by a &s;hepherd, who is bound to return the number of &s;heep delivered to him, either alive, or in his account of dead &s;heep, which are in
<PB N="130" REF="148">general &s;old at different prices, according to their good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The ewes are 2&frac12; years old before they are put to the tup; and are kept till five or &s;ix years old: the lo&s;s of lambs is &s;ometimes very con&s;iderable, not only on being dropped, but al&s;o from other di&s;orders, as the <HI>"milk-ill,"</HI> which attacks them from 3 to 7 days old, the <HI>"quarter-ill,"</HI> &amp;c. which Mr Chi&s;holm of Clennel e&s;timates at not le&s;s than 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> taking one year with another.

<P><HI>The Heath Sheep</HI>&mdash;have large &s;piral horns, black faces and legs, a fierce wild-looking eye, and &s;hort firm carca&s;&s;es (weighing from 12 to 16 lb. per quarter) covered with long, open, coar&s;e &s;hagged wool.

We have before &s;tated that the finene&s;s of wool is not a proper criterion, by which the merits of a breed of &s;heep are to be determined; it can only be done by fair experiment, in which all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e are included; but we do not find that this has ever been done by either party, and tho' it is only opinion a|gain&s;t opinion, yet both parties are &s;o po&s;itive, that they are ready to quarrel with any per&s;on who happens to ex|pre&s;s an opinion of his own: we &s;hall therefore content our&s;elves with &s;tating, that the que&s;tion can only be pro|perly decided by a parcel of each kind of ewes (&s;uppo&s;e 100) being depa&s;tured and kept in every re&s;pect equally alike, upon &s;ome of tho&s;e high, expo&s;ed &s;ituations, the height of which is much more elevated, and the herbage much coar&s;er than the Cheviot pa&s;tures; and almo&s;t to|tally covered with <HI>Heath or Hather (Erica Vulgaris.)</HI> And at the end of <HI>five, &s;ix, or &s;even years,</HI> that breed which has brought the greate&s;t number of &s;heep to mar|ket, and made the mo&s;t profit, will de&s;ervedly be deemed the <HI>hardie&s;t, be&s;t,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t eligible,</HI> for &s;uch &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Until &s;ome experiment of this kind determine the matter; we hope, we &s;hall not give offence to either party by &s;tating, that we have &s;een the heath &s;heep bred with advantage upon higher and coar&s;er pa&s;tures than <HI>Common Burn,</HI> or tho&s;e others around Cheviot, which are deemed improper for a breeding flock of the Cheviot kind; and that it may probably turn out, that each breed is particu|larly adapted to particular &s;ituations, the one to <HI>coar&s;e expo&s;|ed
<PB N="132" REF="151">mountains,</HI> where the luxury of green herbage is thinly &s;cattered, or rarely to be found: the other, to <HI>hilly pa&s;tures,</HI> where con&s;iderable portions of verdant &s;urface predomin|ate, &s;uch as characterize the pa&s;toral di&s;tricts around Cheviot.</P>
<P><HI>The long-woolled &s;heep,</HI>&mdash;which formerly occupied the lower di&s;trict of this county, were called <HI>Muggs,</HI> probably from their faces being covered with a muff of wool, clo&s;e to their eyes. The&s;e being a &s;low feeding tribe, have given way to the Di&s;hley breed, which were fir&s;t intro|duced into this county in the year 1766,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Me&s;&s;rs Culley.</NOTE> and by their &s;uperior merit have &s;o far made their way again&s;t every prejudice and oppo&s;ition, that it is probable in a few years there will be a difficulty in finding a flock that is not more or le&s;s related to the Di&s;hley blood.</P>
<P><HI>The improved breed of long-woolled &s;heep</HI>&mdash;are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from other long-woolled kinds by their fine lively eyes, clean heads, &s;traight broad flat backs, round barrel-like bodies, very fine &s;mall bones, thin pelts; and that &s;in|gular property of making fat at an early age, perhaps more than any thing el&s;e, gives them a &s;uperiority over the other breed in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The weight of the carca&s;e in general is, ewes three or four years old, from 18 to 26 lb. per quarter; the wool upon an average, 7&frac12;lb. a fleece; the length from 6 to 14 inches; &s;old in 1792, at 10d. per lb.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t approved mode of management of this breed of &s;heep is as follows: The ewes generally lamb in March, when we give them a few turnips to increa&s;e their milk. The latter end of June or beginning of July the lambs are weaned, and &s;ent to middling pa&s;ture; but a good pa&s;ture would certainly be a more eligible practice. The ewes are milked two or three times to ea&s;e their udders, and &s;uch
<PB REF="152">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="133" REF="153">as are not intended to be continued for breeding, are cul|led or draughted out, and put to clover: when this fails, they get turnips, and are &s;old about Chri&s;tmas to the butchers, very fat; the price from 34 to 40s. each; fre|quently mea&s;uring four or five inches thick of fat on the &s;ides, and two or three inches down the back, all the way from head to tail. And though this breed be not emi|nent for much tallow, yet ewes under &s;uch circum&s;tances have been known to produce from eighteen to twenty-four pounds of tallow each.</P>
<P>The lambs, after being weaned, take the name of Hogs. They are generally put to turnips the beginning of Novem|ber, and continue at them till the middle of April or be|ginning of May; when the wether hogs are put upon good pa&s;ture, or &s;econd year's clover. The &s;econd Win|ter they have turnips until the clovers are &s;ufficiently grown to receive them, which is generally about the middle of April: they are clipped or &s;horn about the middle of May, when we begin to &s;ell them, and are mo&s;t|ly all &s;old by the middle or end of June. Morpeth is our be&s;t market, where the two &s;hear wethers are generally &s;old for from forty to fifty &s;hillings a head; in 1797, they &s;old for 3l. per head on an average. At this age they are equally fat as the ewes before de&s;cribed:</P>
<P>Of late years it has been cu&s;tomary to fell the &s;hearling wethers, in June or July, to the butchers, fatter than mo&s;t other breeds will be at two or three years old; the weight of the&s;e &s;hearling wethers is from 18 to 21 lb. per quarter.</P>
<P>We generally reckon one third of the ewes to have twin lambs. They are put to the tup, &s;o as to have lambs at two years old, and kept for breeding until three or four years old, except &s;uch as are of particular good forms, or have other valuable properties: the&s;e we keep as long as ever they will breed. Such as are defective in
<PB N="134" REF="154">&s;hape, &s;u&s;pected of being &s;low feeders, or other unprofit|able qualities, we never put to the tup, or attempt to breed from them.</P>
<P><HI>Letting Tups</HI>&mdash;to &s;erve ewes for the &s;ea&s;on, has been a practice in this county for near 30 years, and is becoming more prevalent daily; the prices vary from five to one hundred guineas, for the u&s;e of one &s;heep; and ewes are frequently taken in to be &s;erved by a favourite ram, at as high rates as from 3 to 5 guineas each. The number of ewes to be &s;erved by a &s;hearing tup, is generally &s;tipulat|ed not to exceed 80, and for an aged &s;heep 120.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t introduction of this breed of &s;heep, a great prejudice was rai&s;ed again&s;t them, and clamorous outcries made, that their adoption would be the ruin of the country, and no means were left untried to depreciate their value: but every ob&s;tacle has been overcome by their &s;uperior merit, which &s;eems now to be univer&s;ally acknowledged, as may be judged from the following cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>In October 1795, Mr Thomp&s;on of Chillingham Barns, having quitted a farm, he adverti&s;ed to &s;ell by auction, 500 ewes, in lots of 5 each.

<P><HI>Breeding Sheep</HI>&mdash;of the long-woolled kind, to be &s;old to
<PB N="135" REF="155">graziers to fatten, is practi&s;ed by the occupiers of &s;uch farms as do not afford a &s;ufficiency of turnips, or &s;uch as do not produce any: tho&s;e who are in the latter predica|ment, either take turnips for wintering their hogs, or put them upon good old gra&s;s pa&s;tures. The wethers are generally &s;old in September and October, being then &s;hearlings, for, from 22s. to 26s. each; and the ewes three and a half years old, from 18s. to 24s. each; in 1796, they were as high as 2l. each.</P>
<P>There are few or no &s;heep bred in tho&s;e parts of the county, called Ca&s;tle-Ward, Bedlington&s;hire, and the &s;outh ea&s;t corner of Morpeth Ward.</P>
<P>The modern maxims of breeding were introduced in|to this county by one of Mr Bakewell's fir&s;t di&s;ciples, up|wards of 30 years &s;ince; previous to which, <HI>"big bones"</HI> and <HI>"large &s;ize"</HI> were looked upon as the principal cri|teria of excellence, and a &s;acred adherence to the rule of never breeding within the canonical degree of relation|&s;hip; but tho&s;e prejudices are at this period, in a great mea&s;ure, done away; and the principal farmers of this di&s;trict may now be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the mo&s;t &s;cientific breeders in the kingdom, who have pur&s;ued it with an ardour and unremitting attention that have not failed of &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It is this knowledge of breeding, and the nice di&s;crimination of &s;electing proper &s;tock for grazing, added to their improved mode of cultivation, that gives them a celebrity of character, for their exten&s;ive knowledge in rural affairs, and that has for &s;ome years back made this di&s;trict <HI>a School for Agriculture,</HI> where pu|pils from various parts have come to be in&s;tructed.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Salving</HI>&mdash;was formerly univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, and it was thought the &s;heep could not do well without it. In the lower di&s;tricts it is now almo&s;t totally di&s;u&s;ed; and &s;ome of the hill farmers have laid it a&s;ide, and find their flocks do equally well as before; and the wool &s;ells for a much better price than when it is &s;alved; but it is of le&s;s weight,
<PB N="136" REF="156">as may be naturally expected, from the want of near &frac34; of a pound of &s;alve upon each fleece.</P>
<P>This &s;alve is compo&s;ed of 12 lb. of butter, and 4 quarts of tar, mixed well together while warm, which quantity &s;erves 24 &s;heep, the number a man will &s;alve in a day.</P>
<P><HI>Milking.</HI>&mdash;It u&s;ed to be a general practice through all this county to milk ewes after the lambs were weaned, for &s;ix, eight, or ten weeks; from this milk great quantities of chee&s;e were made, and &s;old for about 3d. per pound. When kept to three or four years old, it is exceedingly pungent, and on that account &s;ome people prefer it to chee&s;e of a much better quality.</P>
<P>To milk ewes two or three times after the lambs are weaned is a u&s;eful practice; but when continued to eight or ten weeks, it becomes very detrimental, keeps the ewes lean, and ill prepared for meeting the &s;everities of Winter.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom has been long di&s;u&s;ed by the intelligent farmers in the lower di&s;tricts; and we are glad to &s;ind it much laid a&s;ide by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable hill farmers. The profit of milking ewes for &s;ix or eight weeks is e&s;ti|mated at 8d. per ewe; and it is generally agreed they are decrea&s;ed in value, at lea&s;t 1s. 6d. per head; of cour&s;e there is a lo&s;s of about 1s. per head by milking. In one in|&s;tance of milking long-woolled ewes, la&s;t Summer, there was a lo&s;s of at lea&s;t 3s. per head.</P>

<P>The be&s;t draught hor&s;es u&s;ed in this county are brought from Clyde&s;dale, in Scotland; they are in general from 15&frac12; to 16 hands high; &s;trong, hardy, remarkable good and true pullers; a re&s;tive hor&s;e being rarely found a|mong them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e bred in the county are of various &s;orts, de&s;cend|ed from &s;tallions of different kinds, from the full blood

<P>Mr Atkin&s;on's of Yevering, eat per week, 13 &s;tones of hay, 2 bu&s;hels of potatoes, and 16 gallons of oats.</P>
<P>Mr Job&s;on's of Newtown, 5 years old working oxen, with a full allowance of hay, had, each ox, 6 quarts of oats per day.</P>

<P>The conclu&s;ions to be drawn from the above &s;tatement are &s;o obvious as to need little elucidation; but we can|not help remarking, how &s;trong the force of prejudice mu&s;t be, to continue the u&s;e of 5 hor&s;es, and heavy, clum&s;y, unwieldy <HI>wheel ploughs,</HI> where a &s;imple <HI>&s;wing plough,</HI> and 2 hor&s;es yoked double, and driven by the holder, would do the &s;ame quantity of work, equally well, and at one third the expence!</P>
<P>But before any proper conclu&s;ions can be drawn whe|ther <HI>ox teams</HI> or <HI>hor&s;es</HI> are the mo&s;t eligible, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, whether the quantity of land em|ployed in &s;upporting tho&s;e animals be u&s;ed in the mo&s;t profitable mode to the community, as well as the occupier.</P>
<P>With the latter, the fir&s;t que&s;tion for con&s;ideration is, whether 8 oxen u&s;ed in the team, or in grazing, will pay him the mo&s;t money?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e 8 oxen, at <HI>three years old,</HI> were put to the plough, and plough 6 acres per week; which, at 3s. 4d.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If to this 3s. 4d. be added 1s. 8d. the wages for the plough|man and driver, it will make 5s. the u&s;ual price for ploughing an acre in this di&s;trict.</NOTE> per acre, is 20 &s;hillings; and if they work 48 weeks in a year, then their whole earnings (after deducting 6l. for
<PB N="142" REF="162">expences of harne&s;s, &s;hoeing, &amp;c.) will be 42l.: but if they plough only 5 <HI>acres per week,</HI> (which is probably nearer the truth), then their whole earnings will be on|ly 34l.</P>
<P>The &s;ame oxen put to graze, to pay the &s;ame money, &s;hould improve in value 5l. 5s. each, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e; and 4l. 5s. in the latter: but we are inclined to believe, there are few &s;ituations, if the cattle are of a good quick feeding kind, where they would not pay <HI>con&s;iderably more.</HI></P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the community, the account will be nearly as follows:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>From the above &s;tatements, we find that an ox for &s;ummering and wintering, requires</CELL>

<P>Hence it appears, that a team of 6 oxen requires 10 acres more land to maintain them than a team of 2 hor&s;es, which will do the &s;ame work: and of cour&s;e, the produce which might be derived from this 10 acres, is lo&s;t to the community: &s;uppo&s;e it be one half in gra&s;s, and the other half in ploughing, then we &s;hall have,

<P>From this view of the &s;ubject, it appears, that if oxen were univer&s;ally u&s;ed for the draught, in the room of hor&s;es, there would be a con&s;iderable defalcation in the &s;upply of the markets, both in corn and animal food.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this county it is e&s;timated that there are capable of cul|tivation, 800000 acres; and allowing &frac13; of this to be in tillage, that is 266666 acres; and that every 50 acres in tillage will require a team to manage it properly; of cour&s;e there will be at lea&s;t 5333 teams, but for the &s;ake of round numbers call it 5000 teams.

Some &s;imilar ca&s;es appear on the po&s;t road, which we hope will be remedied in the next application to Parliament for a new act.</P>
<P>The town&s;hip roads are in &s;ome places good, but by far the greate&s;t-part are de&s;erving of a different appellation; the cau&s;e of this deficiency is in mo&s;t ca&s;es to be attributed to the neglect and manner of performing the &s;tatute-work.</P>
<P>One mode of remedying this neglect, would be to ap|point a &s;urveyor, with a &s;mall &s;alary, who &s;hould be em|powered to collect the compo&s;ition due for &s;tatute-work,
<PB N="150" REF="170">and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mploy th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> money for repairing the road where <HI>mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for the <HI>public in general,</HI> without having regard to the convenience or influence of individuals.</P>
<P>A book &s;hould be kept by the &s;urveyor, and yearly ex|amined, &s;ettled, and &s;igned by a committee of inhabitants, before it went to the magi&s;trates. We know from expe|rience, that by this means the road would be much bet|ter made, and in near double the quantity: for when a farmer &s;ends his cart to perform &s;tatute-duty, it &s;eldom carries more than half a load, and the &s;ervants practi&s;e every manoeuvre to put off time, and do as little as po&s;&s;i|ble which would not be the ca&s;e with hired carts, as every inhabitant would be ready to report any mal-practices.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 2&mdash;<HI>Canals.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In this county there are no Canals; and notwith&s;tand|ing heir manife&s;t utility to a di&s;trict like this, where &s;uch immen&s;e quantities of heavy articles are to be conveyed; yet we believe, no attempt was ever made, or even &s;o much as a canal projected, in any part of the county before 1792, when &s;ome gentlemen on Tweed&s;ide had it in con|templation to make a navigable canal, from the collieries and lime works near Berwick, to Kel&s;o in Scotland, and from thence up the Tweed and Tiviot; but a &s;urvey be|ing made by Mr Whitworth, it was dropt, probably on account of the great expence.</P>
<P>The next public notice we can trace, was given by Mr Dodd, in 1794, of a canal from Newca&s;tle to Carli&s;le, or M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ryport, in Cumberland, to join the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;eas. This was to pa&s;s on the <HI>&s;outh &s;ide</HI> of Tyne: but Mr Chap|man propo&s;ed a line to pa&s;s on the <HI>north &s;ide</HI> of Tyne, the peculiarity of which was, that it &s;hould come from Hay|don-Bridge, to the <HI>upper parts</HI> of Newca&s;tle, upon <HI>one level without a lock,</HI> and the goods conveyed from thence
<PB N="151" REF="171">to the river, either by a kind of &s;tair-ca&s;e of locks, or in waggons on an inclined plane. By this propo&s;al, the principal &s;upporters of the grand canal were divided into-two parties; the con&s;equence of which was, that the money to compleat the great de&s;ign of uniting the two &s;eas, could not be rai&s;ed, and of cour&s;e it was given up; one on the north &s;ide, propo&s;ed <HI>to &s;top</HI> at <HI>Haydon-Bridge,</HI> and another on the &s;outh &s;ide at <HI>Hexham.</HI> The &s;ub&s;criptions for defraying the expence of the north line, we were informed were filled; and application was made to Parliament in 1797, to obtain an Act for making a canal on the north &s;ide, but it met with &s;o &s;trong an oppo&s;ition from the land owners, that it was thought pro|per to withdraw it.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;cribers for a canal on the &s;outh of the river &s;till per&s;evere in their endeavours to accompli&s;h the line to Hexham, or Haydon-Bridge; and we have not heard that any oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ure is intended by the pro|prietors of lands, through which it is to pa&s;s.</P>

<P>Hexham has been long famed for its manufacture of gloves, which employs about 300 hands.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>manufactures of Woollens,</HI> two or three e&s;&s;ays have been lately made at Alnwick, Mitford, and Acklington; and a cotton Mill has been lately erected at Nether-Witton; all of which, from pre&s;ent appearances, we hope are doing well.</P>
<P>There is one &s;pecies of manufacture carried on in this di&s;trict, with an agricultural production of &s;mall value, viz. that of &s;traw, which is not only made u&s;e of as a covering for the heads of the wives and daughters of the humble cottager, but has al&s;o lately been converted into orna|ments that might accompany the riche&s;t and mo&s;t &s;plen|did dre&s;s, which the palace or the drawing-room ex|hibits; and, for the honour of the plough, has not only been converted into buttons for the men, but al&s;o into rings and ear-rings for the ladies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XVI.</HI> OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In our journey through this county, wherever we en|quired what was the chief ob&s;tacle to improvement? the an&s;wer was univer&s;ally, <HI>"Tithes!"</HI>&mdash;An impo&s;ition &s;o preg|nant with mi&s;chief, and &s;o often the &s;ource of violent di&s;|&s;en&s;ions betwixt the clergy and their pari&s;hioners, &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible be removed, either by purcha&s;e, commutation, or any other means, by which a <HI>fair equivalent</HI> &s;hall be rendered for them: for &s;o long as they exi&s;t, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to expect that agricultural improvements will be car|ried on to the extent of which they are capable. In our Survey of Cumberland, we have &s;hewn the great uncer|tainty of employing money in &s;peculations of improving land; and that the tithes, in &s;uch ca&s;es, are a large por|tion of a man's capital in trade, and not a tenth of he natural produce of the earth, which &s;ome have thought was all that was intended by the original impo&s;ers, who no doubt meant them for a good purpo&s;e; but if through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, a change of manners, of &s;entiments,
<PB N="158" REF="178">and of cultivation, has taken place, and the ill effects of tithes be univer&s;ally felt, and acknowledged to le&s;&s;on the quantity of food obtainable from a con&s;iderable portion of this kingdom, a change in the mode of paying tithes would al&s;o be de&s;irable; for the proprietors of &s;uch lands are not only lo&s;ers, but the community at large. It is &s;ur|prizing that a grievance of &s;uch magnitude &s;hould have &s;o long evaded the revi&s;ion and regulation of the legi&s;la|ture; and that it &s;hould be always &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the clergy, there being no wi&s;h to take any thing from them, but to render a <HI>fair equivalent</HI> for what is their due; and which there would be little difficulty in doing, not|with&s;tanding the many objections that have been invent|ed, to perplex this mo&s;t intere&s;ting que&s;tion.</P>

<P><HI>Crows</HI>&mdash;of late years, have become a very great nui|&s;ance, not only for rooting up wheat, and other grain, in a &s;prouting &s;tate; but clover and protatoes, corn &s;tacks, and young plantations, are greatly injured by them. La&s;t Spring, a collection of &s;ixpence a plough was made by a few farmers in Glendale Ward, for pulling down their ne&s;ts. Many thou&s;ands were de&s;troyed by this means; and we hope the practice will be continued until they are found le&s;s pernicious.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Review of &s;ome particular parts.</HEAD>
<P>IN taking a review of the foregoing report, we find, that the minerals are of great importance to this county. In re&s;pect to the coals, it appears, that they are not inex|hau&s;tible, and in two or three centuries will probably be &s;o far wrought out, that the metropolis will have to be &s;upplied from other di&s;tricts with this nece&s;&s;ary article, of a very inferior quality, and at a much higher price.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking parts in a view of the Agriculture, are
<PB N="162" REF="182">the great extent of farms: lea&s;es for 21 years, and the opulence, intelligence, and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of the farm|ers: but the mo&s;t prominent feature, is keeping a due balance betwixt the arable and gra&s;s lands, &s;o as always to have a large breeding live &s;tock, e&s;pecially of &s;heep.&mdash;Va|rious &s;y&s;tems of hu&s;bandry have been tried, and the boa&s;t|ed one of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat, has been pur&s;ued till the crops have evidently declined, particularly the turnips and clover; and the only means of re&s;toring &s;uch lands, has been by adopting the &s;y&s;tem of three years arable, and three years gra&s;s, <HI>depa&s;tured with &s;heep,</HI> and a &s;mall proportion of cattle: by this mode, nature has time to prepare a &s;ufficient lea-clod, which being turned up for the turnip fallow, will en&s;ure a vigorous crop of tur|nips, as it is well known they always flouri&s;h upon fre&s;h land, or where they find the remains of a lea-clod to vegetate in. It is from this circum&s;tance, and the pecu|liar and excellent mode of cultivating them, that &s;uch great crops are produced, with not more than 10 <HI>or</HI> 12 <HI>cart loads</HI> of dung per acre: crops that are &s;eldom worth le&s;s than 4, 5, or 6l. per acre, for the purpo&s;es of feeding cattle and &s;heep, have in &s;ome in&s;tances been &s;old for 7 and 8l. per acre. This mode of cultivating turnips in drills, is al&s;o of great importance, being much &s;uperior to the broad-ca&s;t culture, not only for the turnip crop, but for every other crop that &s;ucceeds them.</P>
<P>The proportion betwixt the quantities in arable and gra&s;s, varies according to the quality of the &s;oil, and other circum&s;tances; but in mo&s;t &s;ituations it is u&s;ual to keep a certain portion of the be&s;t and riche&s;t old grazing lands, con&s;tantly in gra&s;s, as a "corps de re&s;erve," in ca&s;e the artificial gra&s;&s;es fail; and on &s;trong clayey &s;oils, for depa&s;|turing a portion of the &s;tore flock upon in winter; for this purpo&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary upon &s;uch &s;oils, to have a much larger portion of old gra&s;s land, than upon dry loams;
<PB N="163" REF="183">and which is generally eaten lightly in the latter part of Summer, that there may be a good aftermath, again&s;t the time the artificial gra&s;&s;es fail.</P>
<P>It is this union of &s;tock and tillage, and pur&s;uing the &s;y&s;tem mentioned in page 64, that enables the farmers to pay &s;uch high rents; and which keeps the land always in a <HI>due &s;tate of fertility,</HI> to produce the mo&s;t profitable crops;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a certain &s;tate of fertility nece&s;&s;ary for producing maximum crops of grain; land may be too rich as well as too poor, for growing corn: we have frequently &s;een crops of wheat rendered of little or no value, by the injudicious application of a few cart loads of manure per acre more than was nece&s;&s;ary; upon lands made too rich, corn is very apt to lodge; which not only in|jures the crop of grain, but entirely de&s;troys the clover and arti|ficial gra&s;&s;es &s;own along with it.</NOTE> and at the &s;ame time is managed and kept clear of weeds at the lea&s;t expence. The portion that is kept in gra&s;s for three years, breeds and fattens &s;uch a number of &s;heep, as leave a con&s;iderable profit, probably equal, if not more than the arable crops: the yearly profits of a &s;heep, being e&s;timated at not le&s;s than from 20 to 30s. 6 or 8 of which, an acre of clover will fatten, and an acre of turnips about double the number.</P>
<P>But this &s;y&s;tem are obtained the principal advantages of folding, without any of its inconveniences; for if on an average The 1&s;t year's clover &amp; gra&s;s carry 7 &s;heep per acre for

for 20 weeks, which is after the rate of 540 &s;heep per acre for one week <HI>once in &s;ix years;</HI> at the &s;ame time that the &s;heep are leaving, on an average, a profit of 25 &s;hillings a year each.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="184">By this means, and the lime and manure laid on the fallow turnips, or drilled beans: the lands are kept in the highe&s;t &s;tate of fertility, for producing all kinds of grain and green crops; and the profits from the &s;heep, we pre&s;ume, are much greater, than could be obtained from the <HI>"folding-breeds;"</HI> by the mode of folding practi&s;ed in Norfolk, and &s;ome other parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>It our farms were &s;tocked with tho&s;e breeds of &s;heep, &s;o much extolled for their folding properties, and managed under the folding &s;y&s;tem, we are clearly of opinion, (from having examined the various breeds,) that a very great diminution of rental would take place in a few years. But when the Northumbrian farmers are informed that the profits of a Norfolk &s;heep in "lamb, wool, and fold|ing, are only from 10 to 13 &s;hillings per year,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Su&s;&s;olk report, by A. Young, E&s;q.</NOTE> we need not be apprehen&s;ive that they will adopt this prac|tice, the remnant of a barbarous age; when the country was, for the mo&s;t part, in open townfields with appendant common; but which, we hope, will give way to a more enlightened &s;y&s;tem; though this prejudice for Folding-&s;heep, like many others, will probably require a &s;eries of years totally to extirpate it: the misfortune is, that tho&s;e who know the lea&s;t about &s;tock, are generally the mo&s;t bigotted for retaining the original breeds of the country; and the loude&s;t to rai&s;e a clamour, again&s;t innovation and attempts at improvement.</P>
<P>It will be proper to ob&s;erve, that the &s;heep &s;tock of this di&s;trict has been &s;o much improved within the la&s;t 30 years, that they can now be &s;old fatter at 15 months old, than they u&s;ed to be at more than double that age; yet we find that the &s;ame childi&s;h arguments were u&s;ed at that time, again&s;t changing the "e&s;tabli&s;hed breed of the country," as are u&s;ed by &s;ome people at this day, in fa|vour of the wor&s;t breed of &s;heep in the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="185">This improvement in the &s;heep &s;tock, has been accom|pli&s;hed by the practice of hiring tups, at no incon&s;iderable prices; and which is now become &s;o prevalent, and &s;o many competitors have entered the li&s;ts, that we hope the &s;pirit of emulation will not &s;lacken, and that we &s;hall &s;ee additional improvements every year.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a &s;hort review of the mo&s;t &s;triking features of the agricultural practice of this di&s;trict, we &s;hall next proceed to offer a few hints on the</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Means of Improvement.</HEAD>
<P>To tho&s;e few who practi&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of taking two white crops to a fallow, and of continuing their land in tillage for nine, twelve, or more years, and of &s;owing it up with common hay-&s;eeds, white clover, &amp;c. and letting it continue as many years in gra&s;s, as it con|tinued in tillage; we would recommend the &s;y&s;tem in the article <HI>Rotation of crops,</HI> (page 64.)</P>
<P><HI>Of drilling beans and pea&s;e;</HI>&mdash;we have before expre&s;&s;ed our &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;o excellent a practice &s;hould be neg|lected in all that exten&s;ive di&s;trict along the &s;ea coa&s;t, where they are &s;o much cultivated; we hope that the good &s;en&s;e and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of the wealthy farmers of this di&s;trict will no longer be &s;wayed by old cu&s;toms, but will be ready to make a fair experiment, of a &s;y&s;tem which has been practi&s;ed on &s;imilar &s;oils with &s;ucce&s;s, and may, in all probability, be equally beneficial on theirs. The difference betwixt a naked fallow, and a crop of beans, is too &s;triking to need any elucidation.</P>
<P><HI>Watered Meadows.</HI>&mdash;There are many parts of this county capable of deriving great benefits from this prac|tice, e&s;pecially where the waters are unmixed with vitriolic impurities, derived from their connection with coal mines, or &s;trata of aluminous earth. We have al&s;o our &s;u&s;|picions
<PB N="166" REF="186">of &s;uch waters as are &s;trongly tinctured by infu|&s;ions of peat-mo&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Draining</HI>&mdash;is al&s;o another operation from which great advantages are to re&s;ult; but they &s;hould be <HI>hollow drains,</HI> executed with judgment and well &s;ecured: and not <HI>&s;urface drains,</HI> a foot wide, and &s;ix or eight inches deep; &s;uch are mere <HI>temporary reliefs</HI> to a tenant, but no <HI>permanent im|provement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the live &s;tock</HI> of this county, there is certainly great improvement to be made, and like many other branches of &s;cience, the more we inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject, the more we are convinced of its unlimited improvements: but im|provements of this kind are not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;pread as tho&s;e of cultivation. If a farmer &s;ees any modes of practice more beneficial than tho&s;e he knew before, he can readily adopt them; or if he di&s;covers and &s;elects a new variety of any &s;pecies of grain, more productive and more valuable than any hitherto known, it multiplies &s;o fa&s;t, that it is readily di&s;&s;eminated; but <HI>improved breeds of &s;tock</HI> are not &s;o readily diffu&s;ed; they are much flower in their propa|gation, and much more ea&s;ily contaminated, and are only to be pre&s;erved by <HI>attention</HI> and <HI>judgment:</HI> when <HI>the&s;e</HI> be|come general, we may hope that improved breeds of &s;tock will prevail over the whole county; this period is proba|bly more di&s;tant than a true patriot would wi&s;h, but in the mean time we hope, that tho&s;e who are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of improved breeds of &s;tock, will not &s;lacken in their pur|&s;uits; that by their example, the knowledge and practice of breeding may, by degrees, be better under&s;tood, and a &s;pirit of emulation more generally diffu&s;ed. When we con&s;ider and reflect how &s;low that mo&s;t valuable breed of &s;heep (now be&s;t known by the appellation of the <HI>Di&s;hley breed</HI>) has &s;pread, and how very &s;mall a part of this i&s;land they &s;till cover, one would be almo&s;t led to think that the breeders were not ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and
<PB N="167" REF="187">feeling&mdash;Mr Bakewell has been employed above 40 years in the important ta&s;k of improving this breed of &s;heep, to a degree of perfection unknown at any former period; yet it is a very few years &s;ince many of his near neighbours pur&s;ued a very different, and le&s;s lucrative &s;pecies. To this day, we are pretty well informed, that more than half the large fertile county of Lincoln continue to breed a &s;low feeding, unprofitable kind, though adjoining the county of Leice&s;ter: which is the more to be regretted, becau&s;e that county certainly produces more &s;heep than any other in the i&s;land, and perhaps we do not hazard too much if we a&s;&s;ert it as our opinion, that it &s;ends more mutton to market than any two counties in the kingdom. However, we flatter our&s;elves, that the labours of the Board of Agriculture will have a happy tendency towards opening men's eyes, and convincing them of the propriety of not only cultivating the ground in a more ma&s;terly manner, but of &s;tocking their pa&s;tures with the mo&s;t profitable animals.</P>
<P><HI>Public Farms</HI>&mdash;in every county, conducted by proper per&s;ons, would tend more towards forwarding the perfec|tion of Agriculture in all its branches, than any other mea&s;ure that has ever been &s;ugge&s;ted; and as the gentle|men of large landed property would be the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ed in the re&s;ults of &s;uch an in&s;titution, they certainly ought to be the guardians and &s;upporters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The principal expence would be at its fir&s;t in&s;titution; when once got into a proper &s;y&s;tem, it would require little, if any further aid.</P>
<P>If e&s;tates of 500l. a year, and upwards, were only to contribute 10l. per thou&s;and, yearly rent, it would, in this county, rai&s;e a &s;um &s;ufficient for &s;etting forward the un|dertaking. We &s;uppo&s;e the farms to contain from 700 to 1000 acres, of various &s;orts of land, &s;ome mountain pa&s;|tures, and an opportunity of converting a part of it into
<PB N="168" REF="188">watered meadows. We know &s;ituations of this &s;ort that might be rented for five or &s;ix hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>A farm of this kind would not only be a &s;chool, where youth might be in&s;tructed in agriculture; but even experi|enced farmers might often vi&s;it it with advantage, to learn, the re&s;ults of new experiments, and adopt tho&s;e that pro|mi&s;ed to be u&s;eful &mdash;It would be ea&s;y to enlarge on this &s;ubject, and &s;ugge&s;t many u&s;eful appendants to &s;uch an in&s;titution, &s;hould the gentlemen of landed property ever think of carrying a &s;cheme of this kind into execution.</P>

<P><HI>The &s;oil</HI> is various, but may be cla&s;&s;ed under four diffe|rent heads.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Fertile clays,</HI> or rather <HI>rich &s;trong loams,</HI> occupy but a &s;mall portion of this county: formerly this kind of &s;oil was generally employed in grazing, or the dairy; but &s;ince the introduction of growing wheat, it has been con|verted into tillage, and produces excellent crops of grain.</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>Dry Loams,</HI> including the various degrees from the rich brown loam, to the light &s;andy &s;oils. This is the mo&s;t prevalent, occupying a greater portion of the county than any other; not only the lower di&s;tricts, but the fteep &s;ides of the mountains, are in general of this &s;oil; and in many places, even their &s;ummits are covered with a dry &s;ound earth, producing green &s;ward, with little
<PB N="174" REF="194">heath: we &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t one half of the lower, or cul|tivatable di&s;trict, is of this valuable &s;oil, excellently adapt|ed to the culture of turnips, artificial gra&s;&s;es, the various &s;pecies of grain, and of breeding and feeding the mo&s;t improved kinds of &s;tock, particularly &s;heep, it being per|fectly &s;ound, or &s;afe from the rot.</P>
<P N="3">3d. <HI>Wet Loam,</HI> generally on a clay bottom. The fer|tility of this &s;oil is various, depending on the thickne&s;s of the &s;taple, and the nature of the clay below: it is danger|ous for &s;heep, but may be applied with advantage to keep|ing cows for the dairy, breeding young cattle and hor&s;es, and to the culture of wheat, oats, clover, and ray gra&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4th. <HI>Black Peat earth,</HI> is mo&s;t prevalent on the moun|tainous di&s;tricts, particularly tho&s;e adjoining Northumber|land and Durham: it is al&s;o found on moors or com|mons, in the lower parts of the county; in &s;ome places only a few inches thick, upon a white &s;and, well known, by tho&s;e who&s;e lot it has been to cultivate it, to be an ungrateful and unprofitable &s;oil.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;urface</HI> is beautifully diver&s;ified with level plains, and ri&s;ing eminences; deep &s;eque&s;tered vales, and &s;tupen|dous mountains; open, braky, heathy commons, and ir|regular inclo&s;ures, in &s;ome parts enriched with tufted groves and ri&s;ing plantations; the whole watered with innumerable &s;treams and exten&s;ive lakes, abounding with fi&s;h of various denominations, which, with plenty of game, add to the recreation and luxury of the inhabitants.&mdash;It naturally divides into two di&s;tricts; the <HI>mountainous,</HI> incapa|ble of being improved by the plough; and the <HI>cultivatable,</HI> or all &s;uch parts as have been, or can be improved by tillage.</P>
<P>The mountainous di&s;tricts are &s;eparated into two divi|&s;ions, one of which bounds the ea&s;t &s;ide of the county, and is the <HI>highe&s;t part</HI> of that ridge of mountains, that divide the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern coa&s;ts of the i&s;land, from Derby&s;hire in England, to Linlithgow in Scotland. Cro&s;s-fell,
<PB N="175" REF="195">Hart&s;ide-fell, Gelt&s;dale-fore&s;t, and Spadeadam-wa&s;te, are the names of that portion of the ridge which pa&s;&s;es through this county. The&s;e mountains are compo&s;ed of &s;trata of different kinds of &s;tone, and are rich in coal, lime, and lead-ore; but are no way remarkable for any &s;triking irregularities of &s;urface.</P>
<P>The other divi&s;ion of mountainous di&s;trict occupies the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the county, known by the names of Skiddaw, Saddle-back, Helvellin, Wreyno&s;e, Hardknot, Sca-fell, &amp;c. &amp;c. remarkable for their &s;teep, broken, rocky &s;ides, and romantic &s;hapes; and are in ge|neral one ma&s;s of that kind of &s;tone, which produces the beautiful blue &s;late, &s;o much and &s;o de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed for covering the roofs of hou&s;es. They are de&s;titute of coal, lime, or metallic ores; but in &s;ome mea&s;ure repay this defect, by affording &s;uch valuable &s;lates; and produc|ing that &s;ingular mineral &s;ub&s;tance, <HI>blacklead,</HI> which is found in Borrowdale, and, it is &s;aid, no where el&s;e in the &s;outhern part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The height, ruggedne&s;s, &s;teepne&s;s of the &s;ides, (in &s;ome places ornamented with wood and projecting rocks) the varied forms, &s;ublime a&s;&s;emblage, and picture&s;que beauty of the&s;e mountains, and the lakes they environ, form &s;cenes that few other places, if any, in the i&s;land can equal; and have at different times exerci&s;ed the pens of many de&s;criptive writers:&mdash;it comes only within our province to remark, that this kind of &s;laty &s;tone appears to be very friendly to vegetation: the &s;oil which covers the &s;teep &s;ides of the&s;e mountains, and found in con&s;iderable depth at their ba&s;es, is in great part decayed &s;late; and the mo&s;t fertile &s;oils in the vales, we &s;u&s;pect, have a large portion of this &s;laty matter in their compo&s;ition; this is the ca&s;e in the vale of Ke&s;wick, and particularly at Mill-beck, and along the we&s;tern ba&s;e of Skiddaw.</P>

<P>By far the greate&s;t part of this county is held under lords of manors, by that &s;pecies of va&s;&s;alage, called <HI>cu&s;tom|ary tenure;</HI> &s;ubject to the payment of &s;ines and heriots, on alienation, death of the lord, or death of tenant, and the payment of certain annual rents, and performance of various &s;ervices, called <HI>Boon-days;</HI> &s;uch as getting and lead|ing the lord's peats, ploughing and harrowing his land, reaping his corn, haymaking, carrying letters, &amp;c. &amp;c. whenever &s;ummoned by the lord.</P>
<P>We cannot pretend to be accurate, but believe, that two-thirds of the county are held by this kind of tenure, prin|cipally in tho&s;e &s;mall tenements de&s;cribed in the la&s;t chap|ter. &mdash;The remaining part is mo&s;tly freehold, which has increa&s;ed with the inclo&s;ure of commons, and &s;ometimes whole pari&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or manors, have been enfranchi&s;ed on the&s;e occa&s;ions.

<P>The&s;e hou&s;es have, for the mo&s;t part, a kitchen and a parlour in front, a toofall, back-kitchen, and milk-hou&s;e behind, with four or five lodging rooms above; the front contains five middle &s;ized &s;a&s;h-windows, two below &s;tairs, and three above.</P>
<P>Where farms are &s;o very &s;mall, no great extent of farm-offices

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. <HI>INCLOSURES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE mountainous di&s;tricts are all open, and mo&s;t pro|bably will long remain &s;o: the cultivatable parts are a mixture of old inclo&s;ures and commons, inter&s;per&s;ed through every part of the county.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of inclo&s;ures, in general, is in proportion to the &s;ize of farms: the ancient fields are &s;mall and irregu|lar; the fences of various con&s;tructions; walls, earth mounds, thorns, hazle, and other bru&s;h-wood, all lend their aid in a greater or le&s;s degree; and, in two or three places, we ob&s;erved large tracts totally inclo&s;ed by whin-fences,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ulex Europeans.</HI>&mdash;Furze.&mdash;Gor&s;e.&mdash;Whins.</NOTE> which have a very ragged, &s;lovenly, and un|couth appearance, from the numberle&s;s gaps where the whins have been de&s;troyed by fro&s;t, an accident to which this plant is very liable; nothing but the greate&s;t nece&s;|&s;ity can ju&s;tify the u&s;e of whin-fences.</P>
<P>The fields of tho&s;e commons that have been divided within the la&s;t thirty years, are laid out in &s;traight lines, and mo&s;tly inclo&s;ed by quick fences, which in general have done very well.</P>
<P><HI>The advantages</HI> that ari&s;e from inclo&s;ing, <HI>in re&s;pect to in|crea&s;e of produce or value,</HI> mu&s;t entirely depend upon the modes of management, pur&s;ued after the inclo&s;ing takes place. From the abundant crops produced by land, which has never grown grain before, the occupier vainly
<PB N="186" REF="206">thinks, that it will always continue to do &s;o; and the de|ception is &s;till increa&s;ed, by the &s;timulating effects of lime; but alas! after having got nine or ten crops, the golden pro&s;pect vani&s;hed the farther they proceed, the more they are convinced of their error; and growing corn having become a lo&s;ing trade, the land is left to gra&s;s: but what can it produce? already exhau&s;ted by repeated corn crops, and over dozes of lime, it remains a &s;pectacle of the bad effects of &s;uch culture, and a warning to others to avoid the &s;ame cour&s;e: even under this treatment, the increa&s;ed value is in the ratio of three or four to one; had the&s;e lands been continued in tillage only three years at one time; the fir&s;t year oats; &s;econd, fallow, turnips, or rape: the third, wheat or oats, or (if the &s;oil &s;uited) bar|ley, &s;own up with clover and ray-gra&s;s, and depa&s;tured with &s;heep for three, four, or five years, according to circum&s;tances and &s;ituations, we will venture to &s;ay, the land would have gone on improving, from rotation to ro|tation; would have been more pro&s;itable, and put on a very different a&s;pect to what it does at pre&s;ent, and have been worth double the rent it now lets for.</P>
<P><HI>The advantages</HI> ari&s;ing from inclo&s;ing of commons, in re&s;pect to the <HI>improvement of &s;tock,</HI> is obvious; while in a &s;tate of common, every one turns on what he plea&s;es; and there is generally double the quantity of &s;tock that there ought to be. The con&s;equence is, they make no improvement; <HI>they barely exi&s;t;</HI> the yearly pro&s;its how &s;mall! Should an enlightened breeder wi&s;h to improve his &s;heep, how is he to effect it, while his ewes mix pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly with his neighbour's &s;locks? If he had the be&s;t tup in the kingdom, can he be &s;ure that one of his ewes would be tupped by him, while there are probably not le&s;s than a &s;core of his neighbour's to conte&s;t the female with him? On the other hand, if the common were in|clo&s;ed, every one would &s;tint with that &s;pecies of &s;tock
<PB N="187" REF="207">for which his allotment was be&s;t adapted, and in &s;uch numbers as would in&s;ure profit: when he can confine his ewes within his own inclo&s;ure, he can make whatever ex|periment he plea&s;es, by putting a few, or many ewes, to any particular tup, without any fear or apprehen&s;ion of having a &s;purious breed, by the interference of his neigh|bour's: he is al&s;o enabled to keep his flock from many di&s;|orders: few commons but have &s;ome tracts of land liable to the rot: how are they to be prevented from depa&s;tur|ing upon it? or if the &s;cab, or other infectious di&s;orders, have taken place among&s;t any flock on the common, how is he to avoid it?</P>
<P>To the que&s;tion put by the Board, "has inclo&s;ing com|mons decrea&s;ed population?"&mdash;We an&s;wer, that we can|not conceive, how inclo&s;ing of commons can decrea&s;e po|pulation: unle&s;s an increa&s;e of corn and cattle, an increa&s;|ed demand for labourers and mechanics of various de|nominations, tend to decrea&s;e mankind; the contrary po&s;ition mu&s;t certainly hold good in an eminent degree.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 4.</HI>&mdash;Crops commonly cultivated.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wheat</HI> is a modern production here; a general opinion u&s;ed to prevail, that wheat could not be grown in many parts of this county. We were informed that it is not much more than 40 years, &s;ince Summer fallows for wheat were fir&s;t u&s;ed; and it is not twenty years &s;ince Lord Munca&s;ter introduced Summer fallows, and the cul|ture of wheat, in the neighbourhood of Ravengla&s;s, where it is now grown in great abundance, as well as all along the coa&s;t to Scotland, and in the neighbourhood of Car|li&s;le. The wheat that is &s;own after turnips or clover, is trifling, the main &s;upply is from Summer fallows; they generally &s;ow two bu&s;hels and a half per acre, in Septem|ber or October, as the &s;ea&s;on &s;uits, and they reap from &s;ixteen to thirty bu&s;he's per acre.</P>
<P><HI>Barley</HI> and <HI>Oats,</HI> being the grains from which the bread of the inhabitants is made, were probably the fir&s;t, and only corn, grown in this county for many centuries; <HI>bigg</HI> or <HI>bear,</HI> with four rows of grains on the ear, was the kind of barley formerly cultivated; but lately, the common early &s;ort, with two rows, has been introduced. They &s;ow two and a half bu&s;hels per acre, in April or May, and reap twenty-one bu&s;hels on an average.</P>
<P><HI>The Common Oat,</HI> was the only variety grown in this county, and is now by far the mo&s;t prevalent; but of late
<PB N="191" REF="211">years, a few enterpri&s;ing individuals have introduced the early varieties of this grain, with great advantage; they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common oat by the name of <HI>layland oat,</HI> and are the Dutch or Frie&s;land oat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La&s;t year Mr Falder, near Roes Ca&s;tle, introduced the oat, known on the ea&s;t borders by the name of <HI>Church's Oat,</HI> (a vari|ety, and perhaps the be&s;t variety known, of the Poland oat) and which will, no doubt, an&s;wer well on all the be&s;t rich &s;oils in the county.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>The quantity &s;own,</HI>&mdash;is from four to &s;ix bu&s;hels per acre.</P>
<P><HI>The time of &s;owing,</HI>&mdash;March or April.</P>
<P><HI>The Produce</HI>&mdash;from 15 to 40 bu&s;hels per acre; but the average of the county was &s;tated to us, to be only 20 bu&s;hels per acre.</P>
<P><HI>Pea&s;e.</HI>&mdash;In a climate where &s;o much rain falls, and where the harve&s;t is &s;o precarious, the culture of pea&s;e would be attended with &s;o many chances of lo&s;s, and &s;o few of gain, that we were not &s;urpri&s;ed to find them &s;o generally neglected. The difficulty of harve&s;ting them, has probably fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, of building their &s;tacks in the <HI>cloughs</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Where the main &s;tem divides into branches.</NOTE> of trees, and afterwards in &s;lender high pyramids round the boles of tall trees, to prevent them from blowing over: by this method, they can al&s;o lead and &s;tack them, in a damper or moi&s;ter &s;tate; and as they do not come near the ground by five or &s;ix feet, they are &s;eldom troubled with mice. The greate&s;t diame|ter of the &s;tacks is not more than &s;ix or &s;even feet; the height of many twelve or fifteen; if the tree has not a &s;ufficiency of convenient branches to bear the bottom, they nail a &s;tick or two acro&s;s, to form a ba&s;e. When fini&s;hed, they have a very &s;ingular appearance.</P>
<P><HI>Turnips,</HI> were fir&s;t cultivated in this county, to any ef|fect, for the u&s;e of cattle, by Philip Howard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Cor|by
<PB N="192" REF="212">in the year 1755: his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay was drilled at four feet di&s;tance; the crop amazingly good; the weight on an average, 10 lb. each turnip; &s;ome weighed 25 lb; he afterwards continued to grow them at two feet, and two and a half feet di&s;tance, with con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s, for eight or ten years, before any farmer followed the example; at la&s;t, Mr Collins, of Wetherall, made a trial, and &s;uc|ceeded; others &s;oon followed him</P>
<P>It is, therefore, about thirty years &s;ince a few farm|ers fir&s;t began to cultivate turnips; and con&s;idering with what tardine&s;s new modes of practice generally make their way among&s;t that u&s;eful cla&s;s of &s;ociety, it is no wonder that the growing of turnips &s;hould, in a great mea&s;ure, be &s;till confined to the vicinity where their cultivation originated, and we &s;uppo&s;e, by the mode of practice, that from this &s;ource may be traced the various patches of turnips we ob&s;erved at Netherby, Burgh, Dalton, and a few other places.</P>
<P>The land, after being made &s;ufficiently fine by repeated ploughings and harrowings, is &s;et up in one-bout ridges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Provincially <HI>"&s;titches."</HI></NOTE> at 30 inches di&s;tance; the dung is put in the bottom of the hollow intervals, and covered with earth by the plough; the top of the one-bout ridge is flattened by trailing a piece of wood over it, and on the <HI>flattened top</HI> the turnip &s;eed is &s;own by a drill, which a man pu&s;hes be|fore him like a wheel-barrow.</P>
<P>The drilled turnips are hoed, and &s;et out a about eight or nine inches di&s;tance in the rows, which are ploughed between by a &s;mall plough.</P>
<P>Hoeing broad-ca&s;t turnips is not under&s;tood; if any are &s;own this way, they go unhoed; and if too thick, are
<PB N="193" REF="213">hand-weeded. Me&s;&s;. William&s;on and Monkhou&s;e paid 20s. per acre this year, (1793) for hand-weeding their broad-ca&s;t turnips.</P>
<P>The value of this excellent vegetable is not &s;ufficiently under&s;tood in this county, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t have made a more rapid progre&s;s. Probably this may be owing to its being applied to feeding their <HI>own breed of &s;heep.</HI> We &s;aw &s;everal acres of turnips this year, that were &s;old for, from 3l. to 3l. 10s. per acre, which a Northumberland grazier would have thought worth five or &s;ix pounds an acre, for feeding the <HI>improved</HI> breed of long-woolled &s;heep.</P>
<P><HI>Potatoes</HI> are cultivated in one-bout ridges, by almo&s;t every farmer, not only for the u&s;e of their own families, but for &s;ale, where the &s;ituation is not too di&s;tant from a good market. It is only upon the e&s;tate of Sir James Graham, at Netherby, that they are applied to feeding cattle and &s;wine: and by Lord Munca&s;ter, to feeding cattle, who al&s;o gives them to his hor&s;es; Mr Lamb and Mr Blalock favoured us with the following particulars:</P>
<P>Mr Blalock feeds cows, and &s;ays, that 120 bu&s;hels of potatoes, with 16 &s;tones of oatmeal, will fatten a cow in three months, equally well as turnips, of 3 or 4l. value.</P>
<P>The &s;mall farmers apply potatoes to feeding &s;wine: thirty bu&s;hels of potatoes and ten of corn, made in|to meal, will fatten a &s;wine of eighteen or twenty &s;tones weight, equal to corn of 1l. 15s. value. The potatoes are <HI>boiled,</HI> and meal mixed with them.</P>

<P>The land on which the&s;e potatoes are grown, is a mo&s;t excellent turnip &s;oil, and would produce turnips, almo&s;t any year, worth 5l. per acre for feeding cattle or &s;heep.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr D&mdash;a&s;ks, "how can turnips be worth 5l. per acre, for feeding cattle and &s;heep?"&mdash;We reply, nothing is more com|mon; they are &s;requently &s;old for much more.</NOTE> From the above &s;tatement it appears, that an acre of po|tatoes is of le&s;s value, than an acre of turnips for feeding cattle. Mr Lamb has been long convinced of this, and &s;ays, that the practice of applying potatoes to feeding cattle and &s;wine, is every year lo&s;ing ground, and the cul|ture of turnips, which was pretty general here twenty years &s;ince, (but gave way to potatoes) is now, in its turn, regaining the &s;ituation it &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erves.</P>

<P><HI>Artificial Gra&s;&s;es,</HI> are here confined to a &s;mall number &mdash;red clover, <HI>(trifolium praten&s;e)</HI> white clover <HI>(trifolium repens)</HI> common hay-feeds, with a little rib gra&s;s <HI>(plan|tago lanceolata)</HI> and ray-gra&s;s, <HI>(lolium perenne.)</HI></P>
<P>We were informed, that in 1752, no per&s;on in the county had thought of &s;owing a field down with clover, or even hay-&s;eeds; and that Philip Howard, E&s;q. of Cor|by, was the fir&s;t who &s;owed a field with clover, and taught his countrymen the u&s;e of artificial gra&s;&s;es; yet it is but a few that have benefited by his laudable exertions.</P>
<P><HI>Red Clover,</HI> is principally &s;own where the turnip culture, and &s;ummer-fallowing for wheat, are practi&s;ed, and the land continues only two years in gra&s;s: it is generally mown the fir&s;t year, and depa&s;tured the &s;econd. The great objection to growing this valuable gra&s;s, is the <HI>hov|ing</HI> of cattle, which may be obviated by depa&s;turing it with &s;heep, or by a little caution in having the cattle pretty full, before they are turned into it, and to take care to put them to it on a dry day. Some object to it, becau&s;e they have taken a fancy that it impoveri&s;hes the &s;oil. Old Ellis &s;ays, <HI>"Clover is the mother of corn."</HI> We believe that, could the Cumberland farmers be induced to make an experiment, they would be of the &s;ame opinion, and would find their profits &s;o &s;uperior to what they are at pre&s;ent, that they would become converts to the cau&s;e. We hope we do not exaggerate when we &s;ay, that the profits of red clover for two years, would be double to that derived from the &s;ame quantity of ground &s;own with
<PB N="197" REF="217">white clover, rib gra&s;s, and hay-&s;eeds; and that the pro|fits of the &s;ucceeding crop of corn would be nearly in the &s;ame ratio.</P>
<P><HI>White Clover,</HI> has many advocates, and is certainly a valuable plant, where land is intended to continue in gra&s;s for a few years, which is generally the ca&s;e here; and by tho&s;e who &s;ow any kind of gra&s;s &s;eeds, it is in great repute; it is &s;eldom or never &s;own alone, but ac|companied by what is here called <HI>common hay-&s;eeds,</HI> which are generally harmle&s;s, from the heat they mo&s;tly get in the &s;tacks, and their vegetative powers thereby de&s;troyed: where that is not the ca&s;e, we fear more weeds than u&s;e|ful plants would be the produce; for when it is con&s;ider|ed, that of the u&s;eful plants which compo&s;e a good mea|dow, &s;carce two of them flower and ripen at the &s;ame period; and as the time of mowing is governed more by the weather, or other circum&s;tances, than the collection of u&s;eful &s;eeds, it may happen, that not one valuable plant may then have its &s;eeds in that &s;tate of perfection, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the reproduction of its &s;pecies; at the &s;ame time it is probable, that you may obtain the &s;eeds of many plants, which you would wi&s;h to avoid.</P>
<P><HI>Rib Gra&s;s,</HI> is &s;own in &s;ome places where land is intend|ed to continue in gra&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Ray-gra&s;s,</HI> has here but few advocates; a general pre|judice again&s;t this plant &s;eems to have taken place, we think <HI>unju&s;tly,</HI> for we are convinced, from long experi|ence, that under proper management, it is a valuable gra&s;s; it grows in all &s;oils, and in all &s;ituations; early in the Spring, and late in Autumn; and even thro' Win|ter, on dry &s;oils and in open weather: the only rea&s;on|able objection we know of, is the great propen&s;ity it hath to run to &s;eed; but this may be ea&s;ily obviated, by eating it bare with cattle, or by mowing the pa&s;ture ju&s;t before
<PB N="198" REF="218">it begins to flower, which increa&s;es the eatage, by the quantity of bottom gra&s;s it &s;ends forth after the opera|tion.</P>
<P>It is the propere&s;t gra&s;s we know, to &s;ow along with red or white clover; and we would beg leave to recom|mend it, in&s;tead of <HI>common hay-&s;eeds,</HI> &s;o univer&s;ally &s;own in this county, with clover, both red and white.</P>

<P>The hay harve&s;t is here in the months of July and Augu&s;t; the modes of management various, according to the nature of the gra&s;s, weather, and notions of the farm|er: we do not find any thing peculiarly excellent in their practice; the only &s;ingularity is, that the occupiers of &s;mall farms, in &s;ome parts of the county, put the whole of their hay into barns; the larger farmers &s;tack their's at the door.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 4&mdash;<HI>Feeding.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t general &s;y&s;tem of grazing is,&mdash;on the riche&s;t grounds, <HI>cattle with a few &s;heep;</HI> on the le&s;s luxuriant, <HI>&s;heep only.</HI></P>
<P>The kinds of cattle u&s;ually fatted are the native coun|try breed, and Scotch cattle, both Kyloes and the Gal|loway kind. Of the&s;e, they &s;ind the Kyloes the quicke&s;t feeders, the Galloway next, and their own country breed of long horns the &s;lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>The pro&s;its of grazing cattle depend much on the &s;kill of the buyer, in <HI>&s;electing</HI> the <HI>quicke&s;t feeders;</HI> and, when fat, in &s;elling them for their <HI>full value;</HI> al&s;o, not unfre|quently, on the &s;tate of markets.</P>
<P>The be&s;t grazing lands we &s;aw were at Pap Ca&s;tle, near Cockermouth, let at 3l per acre; and the holm lands on both &s;ides the Eden, near Carli&s;le, let at 2l. 10s. per acre, for the purpo&s;es of <HI>grazing only.</HI> Mr Teal&s;on, of the
<PB N="199" REF="219">former place, buys in oxen and heifers in October, keeps them all Winter upon the pa&s;tures out of which his fat &s;tock has been recently &s;old, and gives them a little hay in bad weather. After keeping them near twelve months, they leave, on an average, <HI>a profit of</HI> 5l <HI>each;</HI> their weight, from fifty to &s;ixty &s;tone. But this interligent gentleman was candid enough to confe&s;s, that he thought &s;heep, mixed among&s;t cattle, a more profitable &s;y&s;tem; and we were glad to find this mode practi&s;ed by all the be&s;t gra|ziers in the county.</P>
<P><HI>Of Sheep-grazing,</HI> there are two branches; fir&s;t, feed|ing wethers; and, &s;econdly, ewes for fat lambs: they are both bought in the Autumn, are kept on gra&s;s the whole time, and get no other food, except hay in &s;tormy wea|ther.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER X.</HI> WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county is far from being well wooded. The Irthing, Eden, and Caldew, are the only rivers,
<PB N="201" REF="221">who&s;e banks produce any quantity of <HI>natural wood;</HI> and of the&s;e, the banks of the Caldew &s;eem to have the larg|e&s;t proportion of old oak-timber. Of the value of the oak-timber proper for the purpo&s;es of &s;hip-building, we could obtain no &s;atisfactory information, but &s;u&s;pect, from what we &s;aw, it is of &s;mall extent: we fear, the oak is not &s;uffered to attain a &s;ufficient age for this purpo&s;e; as we &s;aw a wood near We&s;t Ward (now felling) of upwards of two hundred acres, that was little more than thirty years old, the whole cut away, without leaving any to &s;tand for &s;hip timber.</P>
<P>Of late years, many plantations have been made near gentlement's &s;eats, which &s;hew, by their vigorous growth, how well adapted the greate&s;t part of this county is for the production of wood. From the nakedne&s;s of the country along the coa&s;t, one would naturally conclude, that the &s;ituation was inimical to that production; but Lord Munca&s;ter's exten&s;ive and thriving plantations near Ravengla&s;s &s;hew, that the nakedne&s;s of the land is owing to other cau&s;es.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If a cu&s;tomary tenant plants wood, he cannot cut it without leave of the lord; in &s;ome ca&s;es, the lord claims it as his own, which &s;ufficiently explains why the occupiers do not plant wood.</NOTE></P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. <HI>WASTES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>extent of wa&s;le lands,</HI> in this county, is very great: &mdash;Of mountainous pa&s;ture, 342,000 acres, which we &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="222">not capable of improvement from the plough; yet many parts of the&s;e di&s;tricts might be applied to planting, with con&s;iderable advantage, and would probably in this way, make a better return, than if the &s;oil had been in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to admit of being converted into tillage. We were glad to &s;ee a large plantation of larches thriving exceedingly well, on the &s;teep edge of the we&s;t &s;ide of Skiddaw, lately planted by Mr Story. We hope the ex|ample will be &s;peedily and exten&s;ively followed, by every propriertor of &s;imilar &s;ituations; but, unfortunately, the greate&s;t part of the&s;e di&s;tricts is in a &s;tate of common, and no improvement of this kind can take place while they continue in that &s;ituation: of cour&s;e, the fir&s;t &s;tep to improvement is a divi&s;ion, and for every proprietor to know his own part If this cannot be done, the only means of improvement then left is, to convert them from unlimited commons to &s;tinted pa&s;tures.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent value per acre, of the&s;e mountainous di&s;|tricts, may be nearly e&s;timated from the following data:</P>
<P>Mr Greenhow, of Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">keld, takes pa&s;turage for his &s;heep on Skiddaw fore&s;t for a year, at 5s. per &s;core, which is three-pence per &s;heep; and &s;uppo&s;ing an acre keeps a &s;heep, then will three-pence an acre be the yearly value of the&s;e mountains. They can &s;carce be in a le&s;s produc|tive &s;tate; an acre of wood, if it only grew broom-&s;ticks, would pay much better.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Commons,</HI> in the le&s;s elevated parts of the county, there are many, with large tracts of excellent &s;oil, capa|ble of being improved by judicious culture, proper drain|ing, and improved breeds of &s;heep, to many times their pre&s;ent value; which is certainly very &s;mall, probably not more than from one to two &s;hillings per acre. In a coun|ty like this, that does not rai&s;e corn &s;ufficient for the con|&s;umption of its inhabitants, and where it is always one-fourth or one-fifth dearer than in an adjoining county, it
<PB N="203" REF="223">is lamentable to &s;ee &s;uch exten&s;ive tracts of <HI>good corn land</HI> lying wa&s;te, of no value to its owners, and of no benefit to the community. In&s;tead of the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of grain, large quantities might be yearly exported; and in&s;tead of the ill formed, poor, &s;tarved, meagre animals that depa&s;|ture the commons at pre&s;ent, an abundant &s;upply of good fat mutton would be had to <HI>grace</HI> the markets of the county, and al&s;o to &s;end off large &s;upplies to Newca&s;tle, Liverpool, Manche&s;ter, and other populous manufactur|ing places.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay, what would be the increa&s;ed value of &s;uch land, under proper management; we think we cannot be wrong in &s;tating, that it would be at lea&s;t from &s;ix to eight times the value to the proprietors.&mdash;But of what advantage would it be to the public?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 1.&mdash;<HI>Draining.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DRAINING, is one of tho&s;e improvements which has been introduced of late years into the northern counties; and where it is done with judgment, is, in many &s;itua|tions, of the greate&s;t con&s;equence.&mdash;Cumberland has not been behind its neigbours in adopting this beneficial mea|&s;ure: we were glad to ob&s;erve, in many places, great ad|vantages gained, both by hollow and &s;urface drains; &s;ome done with great art, by one or more hollow drains run|ning in the direction of the outbur&s;t of water, and cut deep enough to get through the bed of &s;and or gravel in which the water runs, and by that means arre&s;t the &s;ource, which drowns the land below it; but the like intelligence has not in all places prevailed, for we often &s;aw the drains running in parallel directions, <HI>perpendicular to the &s;ource,</HI> and at &s;uch di&s;tances, as the drainer thought the nature of the &s;oil required; this is more particularly the ca&s;e, where &s;urface drains are u&s;ed. The hollow drains are
<PB N="205" REF="225">filled with &s;tones when they can be got, otherwi&s;e with &s;ods.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI>&mdash;Paring and Burning.</HEAD>
<P>This operation is &s;eldom performed in this county, ex|cept on heathy, or coar&s;e grounds: the expence about 15s. per acre.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 3.&mdash;<HI>Manuring.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Farm-yard dung,</HI> is here, as in mo&s;t other places, the chief re&s;ource of the farmer: where turnips are grown, it is wholly applied to their culture; where they are not grown, it is u&s;ed for the various purpo&s;es of dre&s;&s;ing gra&s;s land, and for the barley and wheat crops.</P>
<P><HI>Lime,</HI> is found in great abundance in many parts of this county, and of an excellent quality. The quantity laid upon an acre varies from &s;ixty to an hundred and fifty bu&s;hels; we found it a general opinion, that lime did lit|tle good to land that had been long accu&s;tomed to it; and that tho&s;e who had u&s;ed the large quantity of 150 bu&s;hels per acre, found their lands greatly exhau&s;ted, and were now fully convinced of their error in continuing it &s;o long, e&s;pecially in &s;uch large quantities. We have had many opportunities of ob&s;erving the abu&s;e of lime, which, mo&s;t probably, is one of the be&s;t manures known, for particular &s;oils and &s;ituations, and under peculiar circum|&s;tances, and proper re&s;trictions; yet, like many other good things, a &s;uperabundance may be prejudical; or rather, we are &s;en&s;ible, that too often repeated, and in large quantities, it becomes hurtful.</P>
<P>Lime is mo&s;tly laid on, while the land is in a &s;tate of fallow; but in &s;ome places, we found it laid upon the gra&s;s land, <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> years before they intended to plough it out. We doubt the propriety of the latter mode.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="226"><HI>Tangle, or Sea-Weed,</HI> is u&s;ed along the coa&s;t, wherever it can be got; the quantity per acre is fifty or &s;ixty cart-loads. This is known to be a valuable manure, either for corn, turnips, or gra&s;s, wherever it can be had.</P>
<P><HI>Slake or Mud,</HI> left by the tide, is u&s;ed in the neighbour|hood of Ravengla&s;s, with good effect, on the gra&s;s lands, fifty or &s;ixty cart-loads per acre.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> are al&s;o u&s;ed in the neighbourhood of Raven|gla&s;s, for manure, after the rate of five or &s;ix cart-loads per acre; they are got on the &s;ands adjoining the coa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Sea Sand.</HI>&mdash;An accidental experiment of Lord Munca&s;|ter's &s;hewed its utility in de&s;troying mo&s;s, but it is not u&s;ed as a manure.</P>
<P><HI>Compo&s;t.</HI>&mdash;It &s;eems a general practice through every part of the county, to make a compo&s;t of lime and earth, in the proportion of one cart-load of lime, to four or five of earth; they u&s;e it as a top-dre&s;&s;ing to their gra&s;s lands, and find it very beneficial.</P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 4.&mdash;<HI>Weeding.</HI></HEAD>
<P>All kinds of grain are &s;own broad-ca&s;t; the only weeding it gets is by hand: hoeing a crop of corn, we be|lieve, was never once practi&s;ed in the county. Turnips and potatoes are the only crops in which weeds are de|&s;troyed by hoeing.</P>

<P>The only attempts we &s;aw of this &s;pecies of improve|ment, that had the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a watered meadow laid out by art, was at Bleatarn (about &s;ix miles ea&s;t of Carli&s;le,) belonging to Mr Richard&s;on of Rickerby, to whom his country is highly indebted, for the &s;pirited ex|ample he has &s;et in many other improvements.

It is unfortu|nate, that the fir&s;t attempt &s;hould have been made in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, in a county &s;o pregnant with favourable &s;ituations, and the water of &s;uch an excellent quality, uncontaminated with mineral particles, or infu&s;ions that are &s;u&s;pected to be inimical to vegetation.</P>

<P>The be&s;t mode of improving peat earth, being a de&s;i|deratum of great con&s;equence, the more facts that can be collected upon this head, the more light will be thrown on the &s;ubject, and the more likely we &s;hall be to obtain the object &s;ought for.</P>
<P>At Bleatarn, Mr Richard&s;on has made great improve|ment, on a poor black moory &s;oil, growing very &s;hort heath, in its original &s;tate, not worth &s;ixpence per acre. He ploughs in Autumn, and lets it lie till the Autumn following; then ploughs acro&s;s; and the next Summer makes a complete fallow, which he limes, after the rate of one hundred and fifty bu&s;hels per acre; and in April or May following &s;ows it with gra&s;s-&s;eeds (without corn) in the following proportion per acre: white clover, 8 lb.; red, 4 lb.; rib-gra&s;s, 4 lb.; ray-gra&s;s, 1&frac12; bu&s;hels; and common hay-&s;eeds, 6 bu&s;hels.</P>
<P>Another mode is to plough up in the Winter, and leave it in that &s;tate thro' the Summer, to rot, until next Spring, when it is ploughed acro&s;s, and made &s;ufficiently fine by repeated harrowings, ploughings, and burning of the &s;ods, to &s;ow with turnips in June: to the above quantity of lime is added 30 &s;ingle-hor&s;e cart loads of dung. On a part of the fallow this year, we &s;aw &s;ome drilled turnips,
<PB N="208" REF="228">worth 3l. an acre: in addition to the lime, they had fifty &s;ingle-hor&s;e cart-loads of dung per acre: but as dung is rarely to be procured for improvements of this kind, we think, that a crop of rape might be got for Spring &s;eed, without dung, which would certainly be better than a naked fallow, as in the fir&s;t mode. The lands that have been laid down two years, were full of gra&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From many ob&s;ervations made on &s;imilar improvements, we have always found the fir&s;t and &s;econd years gra&s;s by far the mo&s;t valuable; after this they decline in value, and in a few years re|turn to their original heath, if not prevented by ploughing.</NOTE> and excellent pa&s;ture for &s;heep; but to make them thus pro|ductive, they are loaded with the following expences, which, according to Mr Richard&s;on's e&s;timate, including the various ploughings, harrowings, lime, dung, gra&s;s-&s;eeds, intere&s;t of money, &amp;c. amount to 11l. 11s. 6d. per acre: from which taking the value of the turnips 3l. leaves 8l. 11s. 6d. the expence per acre, on the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Near Naward Ca&s;tle, Mr Ram&s;hay has made great ex|ertions in reclaiming peat-mo&s;s, <HI>by throwing it up with a &s;pade,</HI> into round ridges &s;even yards wide; the top being from twelve to eighteen inches higher than the furrow, which is cut deep enough to act as an open drain. In this &s;tate it lies all Winter: In the Spring following, he covers it nearly an inch thick, with a compo&s;t, formed of five loads of earth, to one of lime; and upon this dre&s;&s;|ing, &s;ows,

Where the land is dry enough, they plough; and, to the above quantity of gra&s;s-&s;eeds, add a few pounds of white clover.</P>
<P>Mr Ram&s;hay u&s;es few hollow drains. Tho&s;e that re|quire to be three or four feet deep, he &s;lopes off at the

<P>Mr Ram&s;hay informed us, the expences of making the&s;e improvements amounted to 10l. an acre; of cour&s;e, both this and Mr Richard&s;on's, to pay common intere&s;t for the money expended, ought to let at 10s. an acre for a term of 21 years.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 1.&mdash;<HI>Cattle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Cattle,</HI> are a &s;mall breed of long horns, with a few exceptions of the Galloway breed intermixed, particularly along the coa&s;t from Whitehaven to Carlifle.</P>
<P><HI>This breed of long-horns</HI> is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any pe|culiar good qualities, which is not to be wondered at, when it is con&s;idered that, probably at this time, there is not one per&s;on in the county that pays any attention to its improvement. Twenty years ago Mr Hazle, of Dale|main, had made &s;ome progre&s;s in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and gain|ed a very u&s;eful breed of long-horned cattle; but his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors neglected them, and the labours of the good old man are totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="230">The long-horned, and the Galloway polled cattle, are probably the be&s;t adapted to this county of any other; but the kind of long-horns that occupy it at pre&s;ent, may certainly be much improved, by paying proper attention, to breed always from the be&s;t males and females that can be &s;elected. This end would be the readie&s;t attained, by getting good bulls and heifers from the midland counties, where the long-horned breed are brought to great per|fection.</P>
<P><HI>The Dairies</HI> are &s;mall, and mo&s;tly employed in making butter, of an <HI>excellent quality.</HI> Tho&s;e that are &s;ituated in the vicinity of towns, &s;ell it weekly, by the pound, to &s;upply the con&s;umption of the inhabitants. In other &s;ituations, it is put into firkins of 56 lb each, and &s;ent to di&s;tant markets.</P>
<P>The average quantity of butter from one cow, is generally e&s;timated from one to two firkins: &s;ome cows will give twelve quarts of milk at a meal, and make &s;even pounds of butter per week; but the mo&s;t general average is, &s;even or eight quarts of milk at a meal, and from 3 to 5 pounds of butter per week, through the Summer.</P>
<P>Skimmed milk <HI>chee&s;e,</HI> is the principal kind made here, and chiefly con&s;umed at home.</P>
<P>On tho&s;e farms that have a right of common, the gra&s;s lands are employed through the Summer in growing hay, depa&s;turing their cows, and &s;ometimes young cattle; but the latter are more generally &s;ummered on the commons, and in Autumn brought into the old inclo&s;ures, till the approach of Winter, when all the cattle are hou&s;ed.</P>

<P><HI>The &s;heep</HI> bred in this county are only of <HI>two kinds,</HI>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="211" REF="232">and the&s;e two are probably &s;omething related; one of them is peculiar to that high, expo&s;ed, rocky, mountain|ous di&s;trict, at the head of the Duddon and E&s;k rivers, more particularly known by the names of Hardknot, Sealefell, Wryno&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Of this breed of &s;heep, (commonly called <HI>Herdwicks,</HI>) the ewes and wethers are all polled or hornle&s;s, and al&s;o many of the tups; their faces and legs &s;peckled; but a great portion of white, with a few black &s;pots on tho&s;e parts, are accounted marks of the pure&s;t breed, as are al&s;o the hornle&s;s tups; they have &s;ine, &s;mall, clean legs. We were told that the lambs, when dropt, are well covered; the wool is &s;hort, and form as thick matted fleece, much finer than that of the black-faced heath &s;heep; with which variety they &s;eem to have been cro&s;&s;ed, as we &s;u&s;|pect, from &s;ome of the rams having &s;piral horns, and from &s;ome <HI>kemps</HI> or <HI>hairs</HI> being intermixed among&s;t &s;ome fleeces of the wool: they are a lively little animal, well adapted to &s;eek their food among&s;t the&s;e rocky mountains, in many places &s;tony and bare; and where covered, the &s;oil is thin, but the herbage mo&s;tly green, though heath is found on their &s;ummits. They have no hay in Win|ter, and &s;upport them&s;elves in the deepe&s;t &s;nows, by &s;cratching down to the heath, or other herbage; indeed it &s;eldom happens, but that &s;ome parts of the mountains are blown bare, which the &s;heep find out. They do not face the coming &s;torm as reported, but, like other &s;heep, turn their backs on it; and, in &s;uch weather, they gener|ally gather together, and keep &s;tirring about; by which means they tread down the &s;now, keep above it, and are rarely over-blown.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s per cent per ann. is of <HI>hogs</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Provincial term for &s;heep, from &s;ix months old, till being fir&s;t &s;horn.</NOTE> from 5 to 10.&mdash; Ditto ditto of old &s;heep&mdash;2 to 5.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="233">The ewes are kept as long as they will breed lambs, and are often from ten to fifteen years of age before they are &s;old: the wethers go off at four and a half years old. Both ewes and wethers are &s;old from the&s;e mountains, and killed without being put on any better pa&s;ture: we &s;aw a carca&s;e of one of the wethers at Ravengla&s;s, very good mutton, which weighed 11 lb. a quarter, and had 10 or 12 lb. of tallow. The ewes weigh from 6 to 8 lb. a quar|ter; the fleece weighs 2 lb. and &s;oid la&s;t year at 6d. per lb. which we think much below its value.</P>
<P>The mountains on which the&s;e &s;heep are bred, happen not to be common, but belong to Lord Munca&s;ter; as do al&s;o the &s;tock that depa&s;ture them, which have, time im|memorial, been farmed out to <HI>herds,</HI> at a yearly &s;um. From this circum&s;tance, the&s;e farms (three or four in number) have obtained the name of <HI>Herdwicks;</HI> that is, the di&s;trict of the <HI>herds;</HI> and the &s;heep, the appellation of <HI>Herdwick &s;heep.</HI> They have obtained &s;uch a character for <HI>hardine&s;s</HI> of <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> that Mr Ty&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were told by Lord Munca&s;ter's agent, that the family of Ty&s;ons have lived in this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot above four hundred years.</NOTE> who farms the principal flock, &s;ells a number of tups every year into va|rious parts of the county, to <HI>improve the hardine&s;s of other &s;locks;</HI> the price is often as high as two guineas and a half.</P>
<P>The &s;heep, through the whole of this county (except the <HI>Herdwicks)</HI> have been de&s;cended from the <HI>black-faced, coar&s;e-woolled, heath &s;heep;</HI> but by cro&s;&s;ing with &s;ome o|ther kind, (probably the <HI>Herdwicks)</HI> many of them have acquired a large portion of <HI>white</HI> on their <HI>faces</HI> and <HI>legs;</HI> &s;ome have tho&s;e parts &s;peckled, and others totally black; they are in general horned, high &s;houldered, narrow back|ed, flat &s;ided, &s;trong boned, and many with thick, rough, hairy legs. The <HI>wool</HI> is coar&s;e and long, but falls &s;hort in

<P><HI>The management of &s;heep,</HI> over all this county, is very &s;imilar; through the Summer the whole flock is depa&s;|tured on the commons, and range at large without any per&s;on to look after them: in November, the whole are gathered together and &s;alved;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;alve is compo&s;ed of butter and tar, in the proportion of &s;ixteen pounds of the former to four quarts of the latter. This quantity will &s;alve forty &s;heep.</NOTE> the old &s;heep are turned again upon the common, but the hogs are kept in the old inclo&s;ures; &s;ome part of which has been kept uneat|en, to &s;upport them through the Winter: on the approach of &s;now, the old &s;heep are brought to the inclo&s;ures, or to &s;ome part of the common adjoining, and are daily fod|dered with hay, while the &s;torm continues. Tho&s;e who have not a &s;u&s;&s;iciency of inclo&s;ed ground for wintering their hogs, take wintering for them, in tho&s;e parts of the low country where they do not breed &s;heep; the price, 2s. per head, to have hay in bad weather.</P>
<P>In E&s;kdale and Mitredale, they formerly kept their hogs in the hou&s;e all Winter on hay, and drove them to water once a day; but this practice is now laid a&s;ide, and they winter them upon the inclo&s;ed grounds, which are previou&s;ly kept fre&s;h for that purpo&s;e. They give no hay to their &s;heep here, which are a good deal of the <HI>Herd|wick blood.</HI></P>

<P>We have no he&s;itation in &s;aying, that the breeds may be improved, for there are few places where they have been more neglected. At Penruddock we ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;ingularly rough legged, ill-formed &s;heep; on a&s;king an old farmer, from whence they had that breed, or where they got their tups? He innocently replied, <HI>Lord, Sir! they are &s;ik as God &s;et upon the land, we never change any!</HI> The latter pare of this &s;imple &s;tatement we readily believe; but that God <HI>&s;et upon the land</HI> &s;uch ill-formed, unpro&s;ita|ble animals, we cannot &s;o readily a&s;&s;ent to; and rather think, they have acquired their pre&s;ent ill-form, and bad properties, by the indolence and ignorance of the owners. We wi&s;h we could avoid adding, that the &s;ame practice which guides the men of Penruddock, is too prevalent in every part of the county</P>
<P>We found, in general, that the &s;heep breeders here, like tho&s;e in mo&s;t other countries, are very much attach|ed to their own breed. As they have never tried any o|ther, they cannot be admitted as proper judges, of the comparative merit of different kinds of &s;heep; but &s;up|po&s;ing, for the pre&s;ent, their own breed to be well adapt|ed to their &s;ituation, why not improve them, by &s;electing the be&s;t males and females, and rear a better offspring of their own kind? or, by hiring, or buying, &s;ome of Mr Ty&s;on's BEST FORMED and FINEST WOOLLED Herd-wick tups, in&s;tead of getting tups from Kentmore in We&s;tmoreland, which appeared (from what we &s;aw) to have nothing to recommend them, (in our opinion) but <HI>&s;ize and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;ene&s;s.</HI> The &s;hape of the&s;e &s;heep is, in every re&s;|pect, the rever&s;e of what it ought to be; the back nar|row,

<P>Within the la&s;t three years, a few long-woolled &s;heep have been introduced into this county, from the York|&s;hire Wolds, by Lord Munca&s;ter; from Northumberland, by Mr Blacklock, of Corby; Mr Richard&s;on, of Rickaby; Mr Porter, Carli&s;le; Mr Falder, near Roes Ca&s;tle; Mr Lamb, Netherby; and probably a few others:&mdash;and &s;ince our vi&s;iting this county in 1793, to the above names we are happy to add tho&s;e of Mr Graham, of Barrock Lodge; Mr Lo&s;h, of Wood&s;ide; Mr Stalker, of Lambsknow, &amp;c.; who have not only hired tups at con&s;iderable prices, but even purcha&s;ed ewes at as high prices, as from 4l. to 5l. each.</P>

<P><HI>The Commerce</HI> of this county con&s;i&s;ts, principally, in the exportation of coals from Whitehaven, Workington, and Maryport, to Ireland, &amp;c. The number of ve&s;&s;els employed in this trade amounts to upwards of 300, from 60 to 120 tons burden. This lucrative trade has ari&s;en to its pre&s;ent importance, within the la&s;t hundred years; it originated at Whitehaven, from the exertions of Lord Lon&s;dale's ance&s;tors, to whom the coal in that neigh|bourhood principally belongs.</P>
<P>Mr Curwen is the principal coal-owner at Workington, and Mr Senhou&s;e at Maryport. At all tho&s;e places, coal cannot be wrought fa&s;t enough to &s;upply the demand; ve&s;&s;els have frequently to wait &s;ix or eight weeks before
<PB N="223" REF="244">they can get a loading; a certain &s;ign of an increa&s;ing trade.</P>
<P>"We have not been able to a&s;certain at what period navigation was advanced in Cumberland. A &s;urvey was taken by commi&s;&s;ion from the crown, in the year 1566, of the trade and &s;hipping of this county, <HI>(inter alia;)</HI> Whitehaven was then &s;o far from promi&s;ing it would ever arrive at its pre&s;ent wealthy and flouri&s;hing &s;tate, that it con&s;i&s;ted only of <HI>&s;ix cottages,</HI> &s;cattered on the beach, and hidden in the creek from the eye of an enemy, and to this dejected port one &s;mall bark only belonged, of nine or ten tons burthen. Nay, it is not more incredible than true, that there was at that time only one ve&s;&s;el ap|pertaining to the whole county, that was of ten tons bur|then. The whole exports of this exten&s;ive county, were nothing but a &s;mall quantity of <HI>herrings and cod fi&s;h;</HI> and the inhabitants knew &s;o little of the luxuries and enjoy|ments of life, that the whole of this great coa&s;t receiv|ed no other <HI>imports</HI> than a little &s;alt.</P>
<P>About the year 1582, the Earl of Lincoln being Lord High Admiral, cau&s;ed an account to be taken of the &s;hips and mariners within this county; when all the ve&s;&s;els a|mounted only to twelve, and not one carried eighty tons. The number of mariners and fi&s;hermen were 198, of whom many had never navigated a ve&s;&s;el &s;uperior to an open boat.</P>
<P>In 1607, <HI>Workington</HI> was the chief haven, and the place from whence certain criminals, &s;entenced to bani&s;h|ment, were exported to Ireland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchin&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Cumberland.</NOTE>"</P>
<P><HI>Maryport,</HI> in the year 1752, con&s;i&s;ted of only one farm-hou&s;e; in that year another hou&s;e was built. It is now a neat, well built, middle-&s;ized market-town, with a &s;mall and good harbour, inclo&s;ed by two piers; and in
<PB N="224" REF="245">1793, contained 3445 inhabitants, which increa&s;e about 100 yearly. The ground upon which the town is built, belonged to Humphry Senhou&s;e, E&s;q. To encourage &s;et|tlers, he &s;old off hou&s;e and yard &s;teads, re&s;erving a ground rent. The land around it lets for 2 or 3l. an acre, which would not have been worth more than 1l. had things re|mained as they were in 1752.</P>
<P>The quantity of coals exported from the&s;e ports, taken on an average of 11 years, (from 1781 to 1792) is as fol|lows:

<P>The duty on coals exported from the&s;e ports, is 1s. 2d. per chaldron to Ireland, and 5s. to foreign ports.</P>
<P>Butter, bacon, and hams of an excellent quality, form a part of the commerce of this county. The article of butter, is &s;aid to amount to 30000l. per ann: the whole chiefly for the London market; to which place, al&s;o, con|&s;iderable quantities of fre&s;h &s;almon are &s;ent from Carli&s;le.</P>

<P><PB N="225" REF="246">Whether the coal trade and manufactures have occa|&s;ioned any improvements in the agriculture of the county, is doubtful; but they certainly have encouraged it, by making a very increa&s;ed demand for its produce.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XVI.</HI> OBSTACLES TO HAPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE great ob&s;tacle to improvement, &s;eems to ari&s;e, from a laudable anxiety, in the cu&s;tomary tenants, to have their little patrimony de&s;cend to their children. The&s;e &s;mall properties (loaded with fines, heriots, and boon|days,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tenures, page 178.</NOTE> joined to the nece&s;&s;ary expence of bringing up and educating a numerous family) can only be handed down, from father to &s;on, by the utmo&s;t thrift, hard labour, and penurious living; and every little &s;aving being hoarded up, for the payment of the <HI>eventful &s;ine,</HI> leaves nothing for the expences of travelling, to &s;ee improved modes of culture and to gain a knowledge of the management and profits of different breeds of &s;tock; and be convinced, by ocular proofs, that their own &s;ituations are capable of producing &s;imilar advantages. And even &s;hould they be half inclin|ed to adopt a new practice, prudence whi&s;pers, that, &s;hould the experiment fail, it would require the &s;avings of many years to make good the deficiency.</P>
<P>The <HI>cu&s;tomary tenure</HI> is allowed, on all hands, to be a great grievance and check to improvement. Would not this be be&s;t done away on the divi&s;ion of commons, as was the ca&s;e at Brampton, &amp;c. where Lord Carli&s;le had 1-2th for his con&s;ent as lord of the &s;oil, and for enfranchi&s;ing the allotments. There are other lords who a&s;k 1-4th
<PB N="227" REF="248">for their con&s;ent and enfranchi&s;ing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The portion given to the lords of manors, for their con&s;ent as lord of the &s;oil, in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom, is one-&s;ixteenth. The part to be allowed for enfranchi&s;ing will depend on the na|ture of the tenure.</NOTE> The yearly value of the various cu&s;toms, fines, &amp;c. might be ea&s;i&s;y &s;ettled by commi&s;&s;ioners; and twenty-five years purcha&s;e, on <HI>this value,</HI> be the price of enfranchi&s;ement, which might be allowed out of the allotment, upon the divi&s;ion of a common; or paid in money, at the option of the tenant.</P>
<P>On the&s;e terms, neither party would have rea&s;on to complain; but where a tenant cannot enfranchi&s;e, under forty years purcha&s;e, it would be a humane act of the legi|&s;lature to relieve the&s;e bondagers, by law; or laudable in the Board of Agriculture, to induce &s;uch lords of manors, to accept a fair equivalent for the&s;e dregs of va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P><HI>Letting no Lea&s;es,</HI> or lea&s;es for five or &s;even years, is another great ob&s;tacle to improvement. To &s;uch propri|etors of land we would beg leave to hint, that no tenant will ever make improvements under the uncertainties of a <HI>&s;hort lea&s;e,</HI> much le&s;s where there is <HI>none.</HI> A tenant may be well convinced, that by proper culture, draining, im|proved breeds of &s;tock, &amp;c. he could make his farm, in a few years, worth <HI>one third</HI> more than it is at pre&s;ent; but this cannot be done without laying out money: &s;uppo&s;e 100l. and &s;uppo&s;e, by this means, the increa&s;ed yearly value of his crop is 20l. Now it is clear, it will be &s;ix years before he can be repaid the principal and intere&s;t of the &s;um expended. Should his lea&s;e expire in the fifth year, he would be a lo&s;er; and &s;hould he have no lea&s;e, he might be turned off his farm at the end of the &s;econd year. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the chance of lo&s;s is much greater than the pro&s;pect of gain. By rea|&s;oning in this manner, he concludes, that it is &s;afer to have his 100l. at intere&s;t at 5 per cent. than ri&s;k it in
<PB N="228" REF="249">improving his farm under &s;uch uncertainties; and that it will be the &s;ure&s;t game, to take <HI>every advantage</HI> of the farm in his power.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if his lea&s;e had been for twenty|one years, he would have fore&s;een, that, by laying out his 100l. he would gain 200l. and, as "the hope of re|ward &s;weetens labour," he would have doubled his exer|tions, and gone on from improvement to improvement; and at the expiration of his term, his landlord would have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing his tenant had acquired a com|petency, his farm increa&s;ed in value, and the community benefited by the increa&s;ed produce. We have heard, it is true, &s;ome arguments urged in favour of letting <HI>no lea&s;es;</HI> &s;uch as would have been u&s;ed by a feudal lord, and which, we are per&s;uaded, cannot long be held by liberal and benevolent minds, enlightened by &s;cience, or anxious to promote the true intere&s;ts of their country.</P>
<P><HI>The payment of Tithes in kind,</HI> is univer&s;ally agreed to be a material ob&s;tacle to the advancement of agriculture: according to the pre&s;ent mode of collecting tithes, it is not a tenth of the <HI>natural produce</HI> of the land, but a tenth of the <HI>capital employed in trade.</HI> If a man employs 100l. in trade, he receives his profits, without any deduction; but if he &s;hould lay out this 100l. on a &s;peculation of im|proving a piece of land, (&s;ay, draining a bog) he finds, if his &s;cheme &s;ucceeds, that the produce is not all his own; the tithe owner comes, and takes away <HI>one tenth,</HI> (which is probably <HI>all the profit,</HI> after deducting common intere&s;t for the money expended;) and this, from off land that never afforded any tithe &s;ince the creation, nor <HI>ever would have done,</HI> had not this &s;pirited improver laid out his 100l. on improving this bog, rather than employing it in trade, where he could have received at lea&s;t 10 per cent. for his money. The bog would then have continu|ed unprofitable, and the tithe owner would have received
<PB N="229" REF="250"><HI>no injury;</HI> for neither he, nor any of his predece&s;&s;ors, had ever reaped any advantage from it.&mdash;This ob&s;tacle certainly might be removed, by giving a fair equivalent for tithes.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is a reform in the culture of the arable lands. To tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to take two, three, four, five, &amp;c. white crops in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, we would recommend, to continue their lands in til|lage <HI>no more</HI> than <HI>three years at one time;</HI> and in the &s;e|cond year to fallow for turnips, or wheat, according as the &s;oil &s;uits; after turnips, barley, or wheat; and on the barley or wheat, &s;ow red clover, white clover, and ray-gra&s;s;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the&s;e may be added, hop-medic, and rib-gra&s;s, accord|ing to circum&s;tances.</NOTE> and continue in gra&s;s, two, three or more years, (according to &s;ituation and circum&s;tances.) Where nece&s;&s;ity urges, the clover may be mown for hay the fir&s;t year; but would recommend to depa&s;ture it as much as po&s;&s;ible with &s;heep, which of all other &s;tock are the mo&s;t profitable, and the mo&s;t improving for land that has been exhau&s;ted by tillage.</P>
<P>It would probably be right, in mo&s;t &s;ituations, to have one-third or one-fourth of the farm in old gra&s;s, for the purpo&s;es of the dairy, and the &s;heep &s;tock in Winter; and we would ob&s;erve, that where land is worth 40s. per acre in gra&s;s, it would be a dangerous experiment to plough it up, in &s;uch a climate as Cumberland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We know that in &s;ome parts of the kingdom, lands are let at higher rents, for the <HI>purpo&s;es of tillage only;</HI> but then, their &s;oil, climate, and &s;ituation, are peculiarly good; and it is a que&s;tion, whether, if the&s;e lands had been in old gra&s;s, they would not have been worth more for grazing, than they are at pre&s;ent for growing corn;
<PB N="231" REF="252">probably as good as the land at Pap Ca&s;tle, let at 3l. an acre, for grazing only,</P>
<P><HI>The live Stock</HI> next offers it&s;elf for con&s;ideration. Of the propere&s;t breed of hor&s;es, and horned cattle, we have before given our &s;entiments: it only remains to &s;ugge&s;t, what improvements may be made in the &s;heep; of which there ought to be at lea&s;t two, if not three, di&s;tinct breeds; that is,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT Britain had long availed her&s;elf of her natur|ally fortunate po&s;ition for commerce, which, encouraged by every means that the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature could devi&s;e, had been carried to an extent hitherto unequalled in the univer&s;e; and the indu&s;try of her inhabitants, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the fo&s;tering hand of government, had brought many branches of manufactures to the highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection; while the cultivation of her fields was left to the feeble exertions of the hu&s;bandman, aided, only by bounties on the rai&s;ing of flax, and on the exportation of corn. It was re&s;erved for our days, to behold a Board, compo&s;ed of the fir&s;t officers of the &s;tate, and of per&s;ons equally re&s;pectable for high rank, di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and independent fortune, e&s;tabli&s;hed to fix the attention of a great nation on the improvement of its &s;oil, and to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ancient and mo&s;t important of all arts, that of providing food for man.</P>
<P>The eyes of all Europe are already turned to this Board, which, it is believed, is the fir&s;t national e&s;tabli&s;hment, on a great &s;cale, that ever exi&s;ted in any country in favour of agriculture, and the advantages of which now appear &s;o obvious that it is a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that &s;uch an in&s;titution was not &s;ooner erected.</P>
<P>At the time of the landing of the Romans on this i&s;land, corn was rai&s;ed only on the coa&s;ts, and even &s;o late as the expedition of Severus, tillage was altogether unknown in tho&s;e parts which lay between his wall and that of An|toninus. But, under the dominion of that wonderful
<PB N="242" REF="262">people, it &s;oon came to be con&s;idered as the granary of the we&s;tern Empire, and immen&s;e quantities of corn were annually exported for the u&s;e of the armies in Germany and in Gaul; and in the year 359, when there happened to be an extraordinary demand upon the continent, Julian ordered eight: hundred &s;hips to be built, larger than the common barks, and &s;ent them to Britain for grain. It is not po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the capacity of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, but it is probable, from privileges that were granted to tho&s;e who built &s;hips above a certain &s;ize, that many of them would contain more than ten thou&s;and Roman mo|dia, or upwards of three hundred Engli&s;h quarters.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the change of manners, it is not to be ex|pected, that the days of ancient Rome will be revived, when the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed citizens united the culture of the liberal arts with the tillage of their fields, and when the highe&s;t Officers of the State, having left the helm of government, did not di&s;dain to lay hold of the &s;tilts of the plough. When, however, we contemplate the rapid pro|gre&s;s which agriculture made in this i&s;land, in the rude days of that &s;uper&s;titious people, who were governed in their time of &s;owing by the age of the Moon, and the &s;etting of the Pleiades, what may not be hoped for from the &s;pirit of an enlightened nation, fully excited and directed to its pro|per objects by the newly e&s;tabli&s;hed Board, under who&s;e au&s;pices, were but the ravages of war to cea&s;e for a century, Great Britain would attain to an incredible degree of wealth and cultivation? Enjoying a &s;oil of great original fertility, and a climate favourable to the growth of mo&s;t branches of the vegetable kingdom, its craggy mountains and verdant hills would be cloathed with lofty timber, or bleat with innumerable &s;locks, its meadows would rear the &s;tately bullock, and its fruitful plains would wave with the riche&s;t crops of every grain that the influence of a Briti&s;h &s;un can pour into the lap of plenty. The per&s;e|vering
<PB N="243" REF="263">hand of indu&s;try would even teach trees and plants to flouri&s;h that at pre&s;ent are &s;ickly and droop, and can hardly exi&s;t through the &s;everity of an inclement winter. In a few centuries more, others might be cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s, which, if directly tran&s;planted to our climate, would immediately peri&s;h When peaches were fir&s;t rai&s;ed in Italy, all the world was &s;urpri&s;ed that they could be brought to perfection out of Per&s;ia. What would Cae&s;ar and Diodorus Siculus &s;ay, were they told that the mo&s;t e&s;teemed wines of Europe are produced in Gaul, Germany, and Hungary, where they imagined that vines would not grow? Or Strabo, if he knew that figs can be propagated in the north of Scotland? Or Lucullus, that cherries will grow almo&s;t any where, which in his time were known only in Cera&s;us, and the milder climates of Europe?</P>
<P>Trees and plants, being altogether pa&s;&s;ive, accommo|date them&s;elves very &s;lowly to a change of climate; but the idea has been already<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No apology is due to the author of J.

<HEAD>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS BY THE BISHOP OF LANDAFF.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Extent of the County.</HEAD>
<P>THE county of We&s;tmoreland was &s;urveyed in 1768, and a map of it, upon a &s;cale of an inch to a mile, was engraved by Thomas Jeffreys, geographer to his Maje&s;ty, in 1770. It appears, from this map, that the greate&s;t breadth of the county, from its &s;outhern boundary, near Burton, to its northern one, near Penrith in Cumberland, is thirty-two miles, and that its greate&s;t length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is forty miles.</P>
<P>I covered this map very exactly with fine writing paper, except the E&s;tuary near Millthrope and Windermere lake; I then cut out a &s;lip of the paper of an inch in breadth, and of ten inches in length, and weighed it accurately; from another part of the &s;ame paper I cut another &s;lip, two inches in breadth and five in length, and found it to be preci&s;ely of the &s;ame weight as the fir&s;t &s;lip; and hence, as the &s;urfaces of the two &s;lips were equal, we may collect that the paper was of an uniform thickne&s;s. The area of each of the&s;e &s;lips was ten &s;quare inches, and con&s;equent|ly covered a &s;pace on the map equal to ten &s;quare miles; I then weighed the whole of the paper which had covered the map, and by comparing the weight of the whole with the weight of what had covered ten &s;quare miles, I found
<PB N="246" REF="265">the number of &s;quare miles in the whole to be 844; now there are 640 &s;tatute acres in a &s;quare mile, and con&s;e|quently 540,100 acres in the whole county.</P>

<P><HI>Templeman,</HI> in his &s;urvey of the globe, makes the area of the county of We&s;tmoreland equal to 633 &s;quare miles, and con&s;equently, according to him, it contains 405,120 acres.

<HEAD>Proportion between the Cultivated and Wa&s;te Lands in the County.</HEAD>
<P>In 1689, when a bounty was fir&s;t granted on the expor|tation of corn, one-third part of the land in England and Wales, or about eleven millions of acres, was &s;uppo&s;ed to lie in uncultivated commons; if this was then a ju&s;t pro|portion between the cultivated and wa&s;te parts of the kingdom, we may &s;afely conclude, that much above one-third part of We&s;tmoreland was then wa&s;te land; as it is evident, from a bare view of the county, that few, if any counties in England, have, in proportion to their whole extent, &s;o much uncultivated land as this has. The many inclo&s;ures which have taken place, during the
<PB N="247" REF="266">la&s;t hundred years, have le&s;&s;ened in &s;ome degree, the wa&s;te land of the whole kingdom; but no inclo&s;ures of much con&s;equence have taken place in We&s;tmoreland. In&s;tead of one-third, I am di&s;po&s;ed to conjecture that three-fourth parts of We&s;tmoreland con&s;i&s;t of uncultivated land: I will &s;tate my rea&s;ons for this conjecture, being as &s;en&s;ible as any per&s;on can be of the objections which may be made to it; but in a matter where there are no <HI>data</HI> to proceed upon, a conjectural argument may be allowed.</P>
<P>It appears, by the return made by the over&s;eers of the poor to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the &s;um rai&s;ed by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in all the pari&s;hes and town&s;hips of the county, at a medium of three years, ending in 1785, amounted to 5,757l.. The town of Kendall, including Kirkland, is the only large town in the county; it is found, by an actu|al &s;urvey made this year, to contain 8089 inhabitants, hav|ing experienced an increa&s;e of 518 inhabitants &s;ince the year 1784; of the pre&s;ent number 143, or about one fifty-&s;ixth part of the whole, are <HI>paupers</HI> living in the workhou&s;e. The poor rates of this town amounted, ac|cording to the &s;ame return, to 1125l. a year; this &s;um being &s;ubducted from the annual amount of all the poor rates in the county, leaves 4632l. for the &s;um rai&s;ed from all the e&s;tates in the county, exclu&s;ive of Kendall. From particular inquiries in various pari&s;hes, I am of opinion, that the poor rates do not, in this county, exceed a &s;hil|ling in the pound in the actual rental of all the lands; but a &s;hilling in the pound (&s;uppo&s;ing the &s;um annually rai&s;ed to be 4632l.) will give a rental of 92, 640l. All the land in We&s;tmoreland, which can either be ploughed or mown for hay, is worth at lea&s;t a rent of a pound a &s;tatute acre on an average; and hence it may be inferred, that 100,000 acres of &s;uch land, or le&s;s than one-fourth part of the whole, would yield a rental equal to, if not exceed|ing, the rental of the county. The high inclo&s;ed rough
<PB N="248" REF="267">pa&s;tures are let from one to five &s;hillings an acre. But whether the uncultivated land in We&s;tmoreland be equal to three-fourths, or one half of the whole, it cannot be que&s;tioned, that there is &s;o much of it, as to render its improvement a matter not only of individual concern, but of national importance.</P>

<HEAD>Improvement of Wa&s;te Lands.</HEAD>
<P>The uncultivated lands in We&s;tmoreland are of various &s;orts, with re&s;pect to &s;oil and &s;ituation, and capable of different &s;orts of improvement. Some of them con&s;i&s;t of exten&s;ive commons in low &s;ituations, and are of an excel|lent &s;oil; the&s;e might be improved by inclo&s;ures, without any ri&s;k of lo&s;s by the undertaking. Others con&s;titute exten&s;ive mountainous di&s;tricts, called by the natives <HI>fells</HI> and <HI>moors;</HI> the &s;oil of the&s;e is, generally &s;peaking, an hazel mould. In its natural &s;tate, it produces little el&s;e than a coar&s;e benty gra&s;s, heath, and fern; or, in the language of the country, <HI>ling</HI> and <HI>brackens.</HI> Many of the&s;e fells are, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, of &s;o little value, that the liberty of keeping ten &s;heep on them may be hired for &s;ixpence a-year. Suppo&s;ing &s;ix acres to be &s;ufficient for the main|tenance of ten &s;heep, the rent of &s;uch land is a penny an acre; and the price of the fee &s;imple of it, at twenty-four years purcha&s;e, two &s;hillings. Whil&s;t there is an acre of &s;uch wa&s;te, improveable land in Great Britain, it may be hoped that, when the legi&s;lature &s;hall turn its attention to the &s;ubject, no inhabitant of the i&s;land will be driven by di&s;tre&s;s, to &s;eek a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in Africa or America.</P>
<P>Above forty years ago an experiment was tried in Spain, with re&s;pect to the cultivation of wa&s;te lands. Several thou&s;ands of poor and vagabond people were &s;ettled on them at the expence of the government. If this experiment has &s;ucceeded (which may be ea&s;ily known,) &s;o far, as that the land has been made produc|tive,
<PB N="249" REF="268">that the &s;ettlers have been increa&s;ed, and that the government has been reimbur&s;ed the whole or a princi|pal part of its expence, it may induce other governments to adopt the &s;ame or a &s;imilar plan. The giving a cot|tage, and a few acres of land, under a &s;mall re&s;erved rent, and perhaps under other u&s;eful re&s;trictions, to a poor man, is certainly a good way of improving the land. When a man has lands of his own, he and his family will exert in its cultivation, a quantity of labour which would not otherwi&s;e be brought into exi&s;tence. The value of this, otherwi&s;e non-exi&s;ting labour is, in one re&s;pect, nothing; it ought not to be reckoned as a part of the expence attending the improvement of the land; and, on that account, many thou&s;ands of acres of land might be brought into cultivation, which would not, in any o|ther way, pay the expence of improvement. The man|ner of improving moor-land, by paring, burning, liming, &amp;c. is well under&s;tood by &s;ome few individuals, and the advantage re&s;ulting from it a&s;certained, by what has been recently practi&s;ed in &s;ome parts of the county on private e&s;tates.</P>
<P>There are many barren mountains in this county which do not admit improvement by paring and burning, and which are incapable of being profitably converted either into arable or good pa&s;ture land: yet the highe&s;t and mo&s;t craggy parts, two acres of which do not afford &s;u&s;|tenance for &s;ix months in the year to one &s;heep, might, with a great pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, be planted with larches; I &s;ay with a great pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, for I do not &s;peak with certainty, not knowing whether there are in Great Britain any plantations of larch made on &s;uch expo&s;ed and rocky &s;ituations as are here &s;poken of: But, on the other hand, it is known, that the larch grows in Italy on higher mountains than any that we have in this i&s;land; and not only that it grows in Italy, where the climate is
<PB N="250" REF="269">le&s;s &s;evere than in Great Britain, but that it grows in the north of Ru&s;&s;ia, where it is much more &s;evere; for at Archangel, in the latitude of 64&deg;, &s;hips are built of larch growing in that climate.</P>
<P>It may be of u&s;e to &s;tate the probable profit which would attend planting the land in que&s;tion with larch. A thou&s;and acres of this &s;ort of land might be inclo&s;ed with a circular wall &s;ix feet in height, (where the &s;tones can be ea&s;ily gotten, as they may in mo&s;t parts,) after the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings an acre, or 300l for the whole; five hundred larches, two feet in height, (&s;o as to enable them to re&s;i&s;t the long gra&s;s,) might be planted on each acre for fourteen &s;hillings; hence a plantation of 500.000 larches might be made for 1000l. Now 1000l. improv|ed at compound intere&s;t, at the rate of 4l. per cent. would, in &s;ixty years, amount to the &s;um of 10 519l.; this is the accumulated lo&s;s attending the inclo&s;ing and planting 1000 acres of rocky land in &s;ixty years. The rent of 1000 acres, at one penny an acre, is 4l. 3s. 4d. a-year; in eight years the larches would be out of all dan|ger from &s;heep, &s;o that the lo&s;s of rent ought only to be e&s;timated for eight years; but 4l. 3s. 4d. a year, though improved after the &s;ame rate of compound intere&s;t, would not amount to 40l. in eight years; &s;ay, however, that it would amount to 81l. which is allowing more than two pence an acre for the annual rent of the land, then would the whole expence attending the plantation in &s;ix|ty years be 10,600l. If the amount of 81l for 52 years, be taken into con&s;ideration, the expence of the plantation in 60 years will be 11,222l. I have here &s;uppo&s;ed &s;heep to be &s;hut out of the plantation for eight years; if it &s;hould be found, that &s;heep will not crop the larch, and from more than one ob&s;ervation, I have rea&s;on to believe that they will not, they need not be &s;hut out at all; nor, on di&s;tricts, where nothing but &s;heep are depa&s;tured, need
<PB N="251" REF="270">any fence be made. I know the advocates for clo&s;e plant|ing, in&s;tead of 500, would require 5000 larches for each acre; I am not convinced of the utility of &s;uch clo&s;e planting, except where it is intended to nur&s;e up oaks, or other kinds of wood; but if that mode &s;hould be adopt|ed, the thinnings, after twenty years growth, would pay the expence of it. At the expiration of &s;ixty years, &s;up|po&s;e that only 250 larches remained on each acre, or that one half had peri&s;hed; the probable value of them may be thus e&s;timated. From a great many experiments made by my&s;elf and collected from others, I find the annual in|crea&s;e in circumference of the larch, at &s;ix feet from the ground, to be one inch and one half on an average of &s;everal years; and this inference has been drawn from the actual admea&s;urement of larches in different parts of England and Scotland, and of different ages, from ten years old to fifty. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the larches would mea&s;ure, one with another, ninety inches in circumfer|ence, at &s;ix feet from the ground. A larch which mea|&s;ures ninety inches, at &s;ix feet from the ground, would mea&s;ure above &s;eventy feet from the ground; but &s;uppo&s;ing &s;eventy inches to be the circumference at twenty feet, and the length of the tree to be forty feet, neglecting the remaining top; then will its &s;olid content be eighty-five cubic feet, and the value of the tree, at nine|pence a foot, above three guineas. But as the trees are &s;uppo&s;ed to be planted in an high, bleak, barren &s;ituation, their annual increa&s;e may not be &s;o great as is here &s;up|po&s;ed; in&s;tead of being worth, at &s;ixty years after plant|ing, three guineas a piece, admit that they are worth on|ly ten &s;hillings each, then would the whole plantation be worth 125,000l. and deducting the whole expence, 10,600l. as before e&s;timated, there would remain a profit of 114,400l. The pre&s;ent value of 114,400l. to be re|ceived &s;ixty years hence, is above 10,000l. (intere&s;t of
<PB N="252" REF="271">money at 4l. per cent.) Ten thou&s;and pounds at 4l. per cent, purcha&s;es an income of 400l a year: by planting then, a barren e&s;tate, of a thou&s;and acres, is improved from 4l. 3s. 4d. to 400l. a year, reckoning the value of a rever&s;ion as a pre&s;ent certainty. Sixty years is a great part of the life of a man; but it ought to be con&s;idered as nothing in the exi&s;tence of a nation, or even of a family, which is a little nation. The wa&s;te lands in this and o|ther counties, are a public trea&s;ure in the hands of private per&s;ons; all of them ought to be converted into arable, meadow, or pa&s;ture land, which are capable of admitting, with profit, that kind of improvement. and &s;uch of them as will not pay for that mode of improvement, ought to be covered with wood; the high parts, and e&s;|pecially the &s;heltered dells in the high parts, with larch, and the lower with oak, a&s;h, &amp;c. When a &s;pirit of ag|ricultural improvement is fully excited, the individuals to whom &s;uch uncultivated lands belong, will be prompt|ed, by an attention to their own intere&s;t, to forward every judicious plan which may be propo&s;ed, for rendering them more u&s;eful to the proprietors and to the commu|nity; their pre&s;ent application to the Summer-mainten|ance of a few mi&s;erable &s;heep, ought not to be per&s;evered in, if any other u&s;e can be made of them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Coppices.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;ome parts of We&s;tmoreland, con&s;iderable portions of land are covered with coppices, con&s;i&s;ting principally of oak, a&s;h, alder, birch, and hazel. The&s;e underwoods are u&s;ually cut down every &s;ixteenth year: The u&s;es to which they are applied are chiefly two&mdash;hoops and char|coal The hoops are &s;old in the wood at 5l. a thou&s;and; they are generally manufactured in the country, and &s;ent by &s;ea to Liverpool; the charcoal is &s;ent to the iron fur|naces in the neighbourhood. The value of a &s;tatute acre
<PB N="253" REF="272">of coppice-wood, of &s;ixteen years growth, is variable from 10l. to 15l.; and if it con&s;i&s;ts altogether of oak, its price may amount to twenty guineas; 6l. for the charcoal, and 15l. for the bark; it being the cu&s;tom here to peel the bolls, and all the branches of the oak, which are equal to the thickne&s;s of a man's thumb.</P>
<P>It is an extraordinary thing, to &s;ee any trees left to &s;tand for timber in the&s;e underwoods, the high price of bark being a temptation to cut the whole down. Fine &s;ap|lings, from nine to twelve inches in circumference, at five feet from the ground, and with bark as &s;plendid as poli&s;h|ed &s;ilver, are felled by the unfeeling proprietor, with as little regret as if they were thorns or briars. Of late, in|deed, &s;ome few owners of underwoods have left &s;tandards, and if they con&s;ult their intere&s;t, the practice will become general. As this is a point denied by many proprietors of coppices, it may be of u&s;e to explain the principles on which the ob&s;ervation is founded.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a &s;tatute acre of underwood to be, in the &s;pring of 1794, &s;ixteen years old, and that the whole is then cut down and &s;old for 14l.; this &s;um will, in &s;ixty-four years, (reckoning compound intere&s;t at 4 per cent.) amount to 172l. In 1810 another fall of underwood, of the &s;ame value, will be made; the 14l. then ari&s;ing, im|proved for forty-eight years, in the &s;ame way, will pro|duce 91l. In 1826 another 14l will ari&s;e from another fall of the underwood; this &s;um, improved for thirty-two years, will amount to 49l. In 1842, another fall will produce 14l. which, in &s;ixteen years, will become 26l. And la&s;tly, in 1858, or in &s;ixty-four years from 1794, a|nother fall will produce 14l. The amount of the value of the five falls, thus e&s;timated and improved, will be 352l. Let us now calculate the profit which would re|&s;ult, in the &s;ame time, from the &s;ame acre of underwood, if it was managed in a different way. In&s;tead of cutting
<PB N="254" REF="273">the whole down in 1794, let us &s;uppo&s;e that 150 of the be&s;t young oaks are left to &s;tand for timber; the then value of the&s;e, at 2d. a tree, is 25s. this being &s;ubducted from 14l. the value of the whole coppice, leaves 12l. 15s. This &s;um, improved as before, will amount, in &s;ixty-four years, to 156l. (&s;hillings and pence in the&s;e calculations being neglected.) The next fall in 1810 ought not to be valued at more than 10l. as 150 trees, then of thirty two years growth, will do &s;ome injury to the underwood: 10l. in forty-eight years will amount to 65l. The next fall in 1826 may be valued at 8l. and at that time &s;eventy five trees &s;hould be taken down; the&s;e trees will then be forty-eight years old, and worth 15s. a tree, or 56l. in the whole; this added to 8l. the value of the then under|wood, makes 64l. which, in thirty-two years, will pro|duce 224l Without e&s;timating the underwood in 1842, and in 1858, at any thing, or the value of the pa&s;turage for thirty-two years at any thing, let us &s;uppo&s;e the &s;e|venty-five remaining trees to be cut down in 1858, being then eighty years old, and that they would, one with a|nother, be worth 4l. a-piece, or 300l. in the whole: The &s;um of the profits, thus ari&s;ing, is 745l. or more than double the other amount.</P>
<P>It is a general opinion in this, and, I believe, in other countries, that it is more profitable to fell oak wood at fifty or &s;ixty years growth, than to let it &s;tand for navy-timber to eighty or one hundred. According to the price which is now paid for that commodity, either by the Navy-Board, or the Ea&s;t India Company, I believe the opinion to be founded in truth. The following ob&s;ervations contain the rea&s;on for this belief.</P>
<P>If profit is con&s;idered, every tree of every kind ought to be cut down and &s;old, when the annual increa&s;e in value of the tree, by its growth, is le&s;s than the annual intere&s;t of the money it would &s;ell for:&mdash;this being ad|mitted,
<PB N="255" REF="274">we have only to inquire into the annual increa&s;e in the value of oaks of different ages.</P>
<P>In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, for 1759, there are &s;ome u&s;eful tables re&s;pecting the growth of trees, by Mr Mar&s;ham; from the&s;e tables the two following inferences may be drawn:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is highly profitable to let young thriving oaks, which are not worth above 30s. a tree, continue &s;tanding.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it is not profitable to let oaks of 80 or 100 years growth, continue &s;tanding.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Three oaks, marked in the tables, No. 8, 11,&mdash;12, in April 1743, before they began to &s;hoot, contained eleven and one half feet of wood, and were altogether worth, at eighteen pence a foot, bark included, 17s. 3d. The &s;ame trees, &s;ixteen years afterwards, contained thirty-four and one half feet, and were worth 2l. 11s. 9d. Now, if 17s. and 3d. had been improved at the rate of 7 per cent. at compound intere&s;t for &s;ixteen years, it would not have amounted to 2l. 11s. 9d.; and of con&s;equence the pro|prietor, by letting &s;uch, oaks &s;tand, improves his property in as high a degree, as if he put out his money to intere&s;t at near &s;even and a half per cent.</P>
<P>Three oaks, No. 2, &mdash;3, &mdash;5, in 1743, contained 100&frac12; feet of timber, and were worth 7l. 10s. 9d. The &s;ame trees, &s;ixteen years afterwards, contained 132&frac12; feet, and were worth 9l. 18s. 6d. Now, 7l. 10s. 9d. the value of the trees in 1743, improved, at the low rate of intere&s;t of 2l. per cent. would, in &s;ixteen years, amount to a &s;um exceeding 9l. 18s. 6d. The proprietor, then, by letting &s;uch trees &s;tand, does not improve his property at the rate of 2l. per cent.</P>
<P>The oak, No. 1, in the third table, was worth 1l. 2s. 6d. in 1757, it gained in one year one foot, or 1s. 6d. in va|lue; if it had been worth 30s. and had gained one foot,
<PB N="256" REF="275">there would have been no pro&s;it in letting it &s;tand, as the intere&s;t of 30s. at 5 per cent would have produced 1s. 6d. in the year; and it is for this rea&s;on that I have fixed upon 30s. as the value of trees which &s;hould be cut down; if they are cut &s;ooner or later, the proprietor will be a lo&s;er. It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that great preci&s;ion can attend this ob&s;ervation; &s;ince particular &s;oils, or the greater or le&s;s thriving condition of the wood, may render it u&s;eful to cut down trees before they are worth 30s. or to let them &s;tand a while longer. It ought to be remarked al&s;o, that large trees &s;ell for more per foot than &s;mall ones do, yet the u&s;ual increa&s;e of price, is not a compen&s;ation to the proprietor, for let|ting his timber &s;tand to a great age. This may be made out from the following experiment:</P>
<P>On the 27th October 1792, I mea&s;ured, at &s;ix feet from the ground, the circumference of a very fine oak, of eighty-two years growth, from the time of its being planted, and found it to be 107 inches: On the &s;ame day of the month, in 1793, it mea&s;ured 108 inches.&mdash;There is not one oak in fifty (at the age of this) which gains an inch in circumference, in one year. The length of the boll of this tree was about eighteen feet; it con|tained about eighty-four feet of timber, and was worth, at 3s, a foot, 12l. 12s. It gained in one year very little more than a foot and one half of timber, or 4s. 6d. in value; but the intere&s;t of 12l 12s. at 4l. per cent. a|mounts, in one year, to above twice the value of the in|crea&s;e, even of this tree, which is a &s;ingularly thriving one.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular on this &s;ubject from a public con&s;ideration. Many men are alarmed le&s;t our po&s;terity &s;hould experience a &s;carcity of oak timber for the u&s;e of the navy; and various means of increa&s;ing its quantity have been recommended with great judgment.
<PB N="257" REF="276">In addition to the&s;e means, the making a much greater than the ordinary increa&s;e of price on timber of a large &s;cantling, might be not improperly &s;ubmitted to the con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e who are concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s. If the Navy-board would give 8l. or 9l. a load for timber trees containing 100 cubic feet or upwards, in&s;tead of 4l. or 5l. every man in the kingdom would have a rea&s;onable motive for letting his timber &s;tand till it became of a &s;ize &s;it for the u&s;e of the navy; whereas, according to the pre&s;ent price, it is every man's intere&s;t to cut it down &s;ooner.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Amble&s;ide there is found a &s;tratum of gray lime&s;tone, which, though it contains a little clay, might be as &s;erviceable as the pure&s;t &s;ort for agricultural purpo&s;es; but, unfortunately for the im|provement of this part of the county, coal is &s;o dear, that very little of this lime&s;tone is burned. The lime which is u&s;ed in the culture of the lands being either fetched from Kendall, or brought up Windermere lake, at a great expence. As there is great plenty of coppice wood in the di&s;trict here &s;poken of, it may be u&s;eful for the far|mers and land-owners to con&s;ider, whether the burning of lime with fagots in a flame-kiln, as is practi&s;ed in Suf|fex, may not be a more beneficial application of the un|derwoods than the converting them into charcoal. Even the &s;pray-wood, here called <HI>chats,</HI> which is too &s;mall to be made into charcoal, and which is now &s;old for &s;ixpence a cart, or more generally left on the ground, might be made into fagots, and mixed with wood of a larger &s;ize, &s;o that no part of the coppice would be lo&s;t. In Suffex they u&s;e 600 fagots, cut in the Winter, and weighing, when dry in the Spring, thirty-&s;ix pounds each, for the burning of 480 Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels of lime.</P>
<P>May I be permitted to hazard another conjecture, re|&s;pecting the u&s;e to which coppices might be applied,
<PB N="258" REF="277">without injuring either the quantity or the quality of the charcoal obtained from them? Pit coal yields, by di&s;tilla|tion, about a twenty-fourth part of its weight, of a thick tenacious oil, re&s;embling tar. All &s;orts of wood yield a &s;imilar oil by the &s;ame proce&s;s: I do not know whether the oil from wood be of an inferior, or of a &s;uperior quality to that from pit coal; but I &s;u&s;pect it to be fitter for cordage, &amp;c. In the ordinary way of making char|coal, the whole of this oil is di&s;per&s;ed in the form of &s;moke; may it not de&s;erve to be inquired, whether this oil might not be &s;aved with profit? The proce&s;s which is u&s;ed in America, for extracting tar from the pine tree, is little different from that by which charcoal is made in England. Whether the quantity of oil which might be obtained from a pit of wood, when converted into char|coal, would exceed in value the expence of procuring it, can only be decided by experiment. The reader may form &s;ome gue&s;s at the quantity, from the following &s;tate|ment: The black part of guiacum wood yields a tenth, the &s;appy part a thirteenth part of its weight, of thick black oil. Sa&s;&s;afras wood, oak, a&s;h, alder, birch, &amp;c. give by di&s;tillation, (and making charcoal is a &s;pecies of di&s;tillation) from a twenty-fourth, to a twelfth part of their re&s;pective weights, of this oil. The difference in quantity ari&s;es from a diver&s;ity in the texture, age, and dryne&s;s of the woods. I &s;uppo&s;e that a cord of coppice wood would weigh a ton, and that four cords would make one dozen of &s;acks of charcoal, and that wood of this &s;ort would yield a twentieth part of its weight of oil; on the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions there is di&s;&s;ipated in making one dozen of charcoal, 448 lbs. of oil, or one ton in every five dozen.</P>

<P>The county in general is &s;o mountainous and hilly, that a great proportion of it mu&s;t for ever remain undi&s;|turbed by the plough. Between the&s;e mountains there are &s;everal very plea&s;ant and fertile vallies, that want only trees and hedge-rows to be truly beautiful. The mo&s;t prevailing &s;oil in We&s;tmoreland, is a dry gravelly mould; &s;and and hazel mould appear in various parts, but chiefly in the E. and N.; clay is found on a few farms towards the Eden and Ea&s;tern mountains, and a heavy moi&s;t &s;oil on others in the N. parts of the county.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI>&mdash;Farm Hou&s;es, Offices, and Repairs.</HEAD>
<P>The lands of the <HI>&s;tate&s;men</HI> and farmers in this county lie &s;o intermixed that their habitations and offices, which are often built together in little &s;traggling villages, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be very inconvenient for farming purpo&s;es; but convenience has been little &s;tudied even on tho&s;e farms who&s;e fields lie unmixed. The principal &s;tructure is a barn, which, at the &s;ame time that it has a &s;table and cow-hou&s;e underneath, is frequently large enough to contain the whole crop of both corn and hay, &s;o that it is rare to &s;ee a &s;tack of either. The&s;e barns are often twenty yards in length, five in width, and five yards in height in the &s;ide walls. The expence of bringing all the materials from a moderate di&s;tance, and of building a barn of &s;uch dimen&s;ions with a &s;lated roof, may be about &s;eventy guineas. The hou&s;es are generally covered with &s;lates, which are found in &s;everal parts of the county.
<PB N="264" REF="283">The &s;lates are not nailed on boards, but hung with oak pegs on laths, and plai&s;tered in the in&s;ide of the roof. A few hou&s;es are &s;till thatched with wheat &s;traw, which is &s;old from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 8d. a threave of twenty-four &s;heaves.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. 1.</HI>&mdash;Size of Farms&mdash;Character of Farmers.</HEAD>
<P>FARMS in general are &s;o &s;mall, that it is rare to meet with one of 100l. a year of rent, though there are &s;ome of even 200l. or 250l. a year.</P>
<P>It might be u&s;eful to know what proportion of the lands in the county is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that numerous and re|&s;pectable Yeomanry already mentioned as occupying &s;mall e&s;tates of their own from 10l. or 20l. to 50l. a year. The&s;e men, in contradi&s;tinction to farmers, or tho&s;e who hire the land they occupy, are u&s;ually denominated <HI>&s;tate&s;|men.</HI> They live poorly, and labour hard; and &s;ome of them, particularly in the vicinity of Kendall, in the in|tervals
<PB N="265" REF="284">of labour from agricultural avocations, bu&s;y them|&s;elves in weaving &s;tuffs for the manufacturers of that town. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their independence renders them impatient of oppre&s;&s;ion or in&s;ult, but they are gen|tle and obliging when treated by their &s;uperiors with kindne&s;s and re&s;pect. This cla&s;s of men is daily decrea&s;|ing. The turnpike roads have brought the manners of the capital to this extremity of the kingdom. The &s;implicity of ancient times is gone. Finer clothes, bet|ter dwellings, and more expen&s;ive viands, are now &s;ought after by all. This change of manners, combined with other circum&s;tances which have taken place within the la&s;t forty years, has compelled many a <HI>&s;tate&s;man</HI> to &s;ell his property, and reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of work|ing as a labourer in tho&s;e fields, which perhap he and his ance&s;tors had for many generations cultivated as their own. It is difficult to contemplate this change without regret; but con&s;idering the matter on the &s;cale of national utility, it may be que&s;tioned whether the agriculture of the county will not be improved as the landed property of it becomes le&s;s divided.</P>
<P>It is painful to one, who has in his compo&s;ition the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of knight errantry, to behold the beautiful &s;ervant maids of this county toiling in the &s;evere labours of the field. They drive the harrows, or the ploughs, when they are drawn by three or four hor&s;es; nay, it is not uncommon to &s;ee, &s;weating at the dung-cart, a girl, who&s;e elegant features, and delicate nicely-proportioned limbs, &s;eemingly but ill accord with &s;uch rough employ|ment.</P>
<P>A judgment of the refinement and civilization of a people has been often formed from their treatment of the fair &s;ex, and in this re&s;pect France was formerly held up to the world as a model. Unfortunately the man|ners of nations are too often painted by tho&s;e who have
<PB N="266" REF="285">been conver&s;ant only with per&s;ons in what may be called high life; but were it allowable to apply this rule even to France, and to look for &s;pecimens into the lower or|ders of &s;ociety, (and it is there &s;urely that the mo&s;t faith|ful repre&s;entatives of national character or manners are to be met with) it would be found that the women, even in the boa&s;ted days of her monarchy, were doomed to the &s;evere&s;t labour, to load the dung-cart, to &s;aw the wood, and to thre&s;h the corn.</P>
<P>The common people of both &s;exes wear, e&s;pecially in the winter &s;ea&s;on, in&s;tead of &s;hoes, <HI>cloggs,</HI> which differ from &s;hoes in this, that the bottom part is made of wood. The wood is generally either birch, alder, or &s;ycamore; it is about an inch in thickne&s;s, and a rim of iron is nailed round the bottom of it. A pair of <HI>cloggs</HI> co&s;ts 3s. 6d.; they keep the feet warm and dry, and, with good care, will la&s;t a twelvemonth.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. 2.&mdash;<HI>Rent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The rent of the land varies with its &s;ituation and fer|tility. In all &s;ituations, and of all qualities, it has encrea&s;|ed greatly in its value within the&s;e few years. This may be owing partly to the advance in the price of its produc|tions, and partly to improvements in the art of farming. At Shap, Amble&s;ide, and in Troutbeck, the be&s;t hay-meadows are let at about 50s. the cu&s;tomary acre. Near towns the rent of the be&s;t fields to be mowed may be, at a medium, rather above 3l. per acre. At Kirkby-Stephen and Appleby they are not quite &s;o valuable. Near Ken|dall, Burton, and Milthrope, &s;ome fields are let at 4l.; and at Kirkby-Lond&s;dale there are a few which fetch above 5l. Lands of inferior kinds may be hired for pa&s;|ture at all varieties of price. In Raven&s;tondale, where no tithes are paid, and where the land derives no part of its value from its &s;ituation, there are between 2000 and 3000
<PB N="267" REF="286">acres inclo&s;ed; four fifths of the&s;e are let from 4s. to 11s. the &s;tatute-acre, and the remaining fifth from 20s. to 40s.</P>
<P>In the bottom of We&s;tmoreland a farm of an hundred acres of inclo&s;ed land may be hired upon lea&s;e for 150l. A farm containing much coar&s;e pa&s;ture-land may be had for 20s. or 24s. per acre. It is not always known whe|ther the&s;e coar&s;e pa&s;tures have been mea&s;ured, they be|ing &s;ometimes e&s;timated by the number of cattle they can maintain.</P>

<P>IT has long been known what angle the &s;ail ought to form with the keel to make the &s;hip move in the water with the greate&s;t velocity; but, to the pre&s;ent day, was re&s;erved the di&s;covery of the angles which the compo|nent parts of the plough ought to form with one another, and with the line of draught, in order that that in&s;tru|ment might meet with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;i&s;tance in the performance of its operation.

<P><HI>Ploughs.</HI>&mdash;The ploughs of We&s;tmoreland are light, and,
<PB N="269" REF="288">although not neatly con&s;tructed, they are perhaps not ill &s;uited to the &s;oil they are de&s;tined to cultivate; &s;ome of them have a wheel at the extremity of the beam, which, it is imagined, &s;erves to keep the furrow of an equal depth.

The turnwri&s;t plough has been intro|duced into the county by the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, and may be of great &s;ervice in ploughing the &s;ides of the hills, which are very numerous and &s;teep in the arable lands.</P>
<P><HI>Carts.</HI>&mdash;The carts are of various de&s;criptions and &s;izes.

There is &s;carcely a farming waggon to be met with in the county; it being a general opinion that four hor&s;es in four &s;eparate carts will draw a greater weight than if they were yoked together in a waggon.</P>

<P><HI>Cour&s;e of Crops.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a field of gra&s;s is overgrown with mo&s;s, which commonly happens in &s;even or ten years, it is broken up with the plough in the beginning of March, and &s;own about the fir&s;t of April with oats, at the rate of &s;even and one-half Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels upon the cu&s;tomary acre of 6,760 &s;quare yards. The crop is reaped about the middle of September, and &s;ixty bu&s;hels are reckoned a tolerably good return.</P>
<P><HI>Second Crop.</HI>&mdash;The land is ploughed for the &s;econd crop as &s;oon after Candlemas as the weather will permit, and eighty or a hundred cart-loads of &s;table-yard dung are laid upon the acre. It is ploughed again in April, and &s;own with four bu&s;hels of barley or bigg: The har|ve&s;t is earlier than that of the oats, and fifty-four bu&s;hels are reckoned a good crop. Some farmers plough three times for barley, but it is the general practice that is here de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="290"><HI>Third Crop.</HI>&mdash;After the barley the land is ploughed in April, and eight bu&s;hels of oats per acre are immediately &s;own upon it. The harve&s;t is commonly in September, and the crop is u&s;ually as good as the fir&s;t was.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t ordinary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops, though it is &s;ometimes broken through by taking two crops of oats before the barley, which, in that ca&s;e, is followed by another of oats. The land is then left to it&s;elf, and the fir&s;t year it produces a light crop of hay of bad quality. In the third year the crop is at the be&s;t with regard to both quantity and quality. In &s;even or in ten years it is again mo&s;&s;ed over, and is again ploughed up to undergo a &s;imilar treatment.</P>
<P><HI>Exceptions</HI>&mdash;1&s;t. To this general mode of management there are &s;everal exceptions, which perhaps it would be improper to omit. From Kirkby-Steven to Brough and Appleby, and from that town to Temple-Sowerby, the &s;oil is a deep &s;and, which, by cultivation, becomes more compact, and more retentive of moi&s;ture. The fields of gra&s;s, mo&s;s over &s;ooner or later, according to the quality of the &s;oil; &s;ome, where the &s;oil is thinne&s;t, and the &s;ub|jacent &s;tratum the poore&s;t, it is judged nece&s;&s;ary to break up after an interval of only four or &s;ix years. In this part of the county there are particular farms, where, after the &s;econd crop, which is oats generally inferior to the fir&s;t, the land is &s;ummer fallowed, planted with potatoes, or &s;own with turnips, which la&s;t are given to the wintering &s;tock of cattle and &s;heep. Dung is always laid upon the fields de&s;igned for turnips and potatoes, and the remain|der upon the fallow, which is likewi&s;e invariably and al|ways &s;ucce&s;sfully limed at the rate of &s;eventy-five Win|che&s;ter bu&s;hels per acre. What is &s;o fallowed is &s;own, in the middle of September, with two and one-half bu&s;hels of rye per acre. The crop is reaped before a year goes round, and thirty bu&s;hels are reckoned a good return.
<PB N="272" REF="291">In the month of May, gra&s;s-&s;eeds are &s;own among&s;t the rye, but are never covered either by the harrow or the roller. Tho&s;e fields which were turnips and potatoes are &s;own with barley or oats, and gra&s;s-&s;eeds, in the follow|ing quantities to an acre: eight pounds narrow-leafed red clover &s;eed, which is preferred to the common broad-leaf|ed clover, becau&s;e it remains longer in the ground; four pounds white clover, four pounds hop clover, four pounds of rib-gra&s;s, and from five to ten bu&s;hels of hay &s;eeds &s;haken from the crop of the former year. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t chiefly of <HI>Bent</HI> gra&s;s, which &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of rye-gra&s;s, of the great <HI>Poa,</HI> or oat gra&s;s, and <HI>Dark</HI> gra&s;s, or Flanders hay-&s;eeds. The fir&s;t year, whether it be hayed or pa&s;tured, the crop is far more valuable than that of any natural gra&s;s in the neighbourhood upon &s;oil of an equal quality; and the cattle, e&s;pecially the hor&s;es, uniformly prefer the&s;e artificial gra&s;&s;es to tho&s;e which the land produces of its own accord.</P>
<P><HI>Exception 2d.</HI>&mdash;In the immediate neighbourhood of Kendall, where the &s;oil is gravelly or &s;andy, it is not un|u&s;ual to take potatoes for the &s;econd crop, and barley for the third; the land is then &s;ometimes left to it&s;elf, but for the mo&s;t part the barley is followed by a crop of oats. A great many potatoes are grown and con&s;umed in the county. The price, at the time of taking them up, is commonly 1s. 4d. per Winche&s;ter bu&s;hel; in the Winter and Spring it often ri&s;es to 2s. The produce is variable, from 250 to 350 Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels per &s;tatute acre. They are cultivated in various ways, but chiefly by the plough. The inhabitants think that potatoes from fre&s;h ground are of the be&s;t quality, but the product is u&s;ually the greate&s;t from an oat &s;tubble. Sometimes the farmer grows the potatoes at his own ri&s;k; at others he manures the land with 100 cart-loads of dung per cu&s;tomary acre, ploughs it once, and lets it in this &s;tate at 2s. the perch
<PB N="273" REF="292">to the manufacturers and labourers of Kendall, who fur|ni&s;h the plants and the re&s;t of the labour. The price they pay is high, but reckoning little for the work they be&s;tow upon it, which is conducive to their health, they are often well &s;atisfied with their crop which is &s;ometimes very great, the land being well adapted for the cultiva|tion of this root.</P>
<P><HI>Exception 3d.</HI>&mdash;From Millthrope to Burton, and from Burton by Farlton to Kirkby Lon&s;dale, both the farms and inclo&s;ures appear to be &s;omewhat larger than in mo&s;t other parts of the county, and it is not quite &s;o rare to &s;ee a few acres of wheat. The land de&s;igned for this crop is &s;ummer-fallowed after the fir&s;t or &s;econd year from the ley, and is well manured with dung or lime, or with both. It is &s;own in September, with wheat &s;oaked in brine, or wa&s;hed with chamberlye, and dried with lime, at the rate of four bu&s;hels per cu&s;tomary acre. Forty-five bu&s;hels are reckoned a good crop; and the harve&s;t may be ten days earlier than it is in the northern parts of the county. If the land is again manured, it is &s;own with barley after the wheat; if not manured, it is &s;own with oats.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 1.</HI>&mdash;Natural Meadows, and Pa&s;ture.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY occupier of land, whether <HI>&s;tate&s;man</HI> or <HI>farmer,</HI> having it in his power to keep any number of cattle, through the months of Summer, upon <HI>joi&s;ted</HI> fields where they may be kept at a cheap rate, or upon commons where they may be kept almo&s;t for nothing, it is a princi|pal object with him, to provide for them plenty of Win|ter food. Hence his attention is chiefly directed to his crop of hay. It has been already &s;tated, that the quan|tity of land, at pre&s;ent under culture, does not exceed one-fourth part of the whole county, or 135,000 acres. Had all the arable land in the county been cropped with corn three years out of twelve, there would have been preci&s;ely one-fourth part of the whole in tillage; but there are many pa&s;tures of an inferior &s;ort, which are very &s;eldom ploughed, and in the high parts there is a much &s;maller proportion of the land in corn than there is in the low parts. In the very exten&s;ive manor of Ra|ven&s;tondale, although there are between 2000 and 3000 acres inclo&s;ed, there are not &s;ixty acres of corn; and it is probable that there are not in the county more than 20,000 acres under crops of corn in one year. The re|maining 115,000 acres are cut for hay, or depa&s;tured with fattening bea&s;ts and ri&s;ing &s;tock, or with cows ap|plied to the purpo&s;es of the dairy. From &s;uch an in|&s;pection of the county as was had with a view to the
<PB N="275" REF="294">framing of this Report, the proportions u&s;ed for the&s;e different purpo&s;es cannot be even gue&s;&s;ed at; but that for hay is perhaps the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. A prejudice again&s;t the artificial gra&s;&s;es prevails &s;o generally over all the county, that it may be almo&s;t literally &s;aid, they are never &s;own. When the land has produced a few crops of corn, and it is judged that the mo&s;s is quite de&s;troyed, it is left to it&s;elf; and &s;uch is the humidity of the climate, and &s;o &s;trong is the vegetation of weeds and natural gra&s;&s;es, that the very fir&s;t crop has, by actual experiment, been found to produce 120 &s;tones of hay per acre, weighed from the field. As every per&s;on who expects to have occa&s;ion for hay, hires a field to &s;upply him with that commodity, it is not often that hay is &s;old in large quantities; and it is &s;till &s;eldomer that the quantity rai&s;ed upon an acre is ex|actly a&s;certained. When &s;old, it may bring from 4d. to 6d. a &s;tone in Winter and Spring, or from 4s. to 5s. a cubic yard. A cubic yard in the lower part of a well-pre&s;&s;ed mow may contain twelve &s;tones of hay, and has been known to &s;ell as high as 7s. or 8s. In the &s;outhern and in the ea&s;tern parts of the county, much attention is paid to the making of compo&s;t dung-hills, which, with the dung that remains after manuring for the barley crop, are always laid upon the hay grounds, and are thought con&s;iderably to retard the progre&s;s of the mo&s;s. At Ken|dall and other places, where dung can be purcha&s;ed, they are manured after the fir&s;t crop, and every third year while they continue in gra&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>Fattening Cattle.</HI>&mdash;The young cattle are kept on the lands of inferior quality in Summer, and have &s;traw and a little hay given them in Winter. When three years old, if barren, they are either fattened in the pa&s;tures, or &s;old to the graziers of York&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire from 5l. to 8l. a piece; if with calf, from 7l. 10s. to 10l.</P>
<P>Ten thou&s;and Scotch cattle are annually &s;old at Brough-hill fair in the end of September. Though numbers of the&s;e are carried off by drovers to the &s;outh of England, and many are brought by graziers from other counties, great quantities remain in We&s;tmoreland. They are wintered on the coar&s;e pa&s;tures, and in the &s;traw yard; in May following the young ones are &s;ent to the com|mons; and tho&s;e of an age proper for feeding are put upon the be&s;t grounds, and are ready for the &s;hambles in October.</P>
<P>Heifers are <HI>joi&s;ted</HI> upon tolerably good pa&s;ture from 10th May to Michaelmas, at from 1l. 1s. to 1l. 7s. a head. Hor&s;es are grazed among fattening cattle for 3s. 6d. a week. Young hor&s;es are kept from Michaelmas to 5th

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER X.</HI> WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>AT Whinfield Fore&s;t, and at Lowther-hall, the &s;eat of the Right Honourable the Earl of Lon&s;dale, there are
<PB N="278" REF="297">very exten&s;ive plantations, where many of the trees have grown to an uncommon &s;ize. Several of the oaks at Lowther-hall, have been valued at fixty pounds a piece. There are many &s;maller plantations, and various clumps of trees throughout the county, where the wood &s;prings with a degree of vigour, hardly to be expected in &s;uch bleak and expo&s;ed &s;ituations as many of them are planted in.</P>
<P>On the divi&s;ion of Kendall common, part of a very high and rocky hill, not being capable of any other im|provement, was planted with Scotch fir, larch, oak, a&s;h, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which are very thriving.</P>
<P>The banks of the lakes are likewi&s;e adorned with very beautiful coppices.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of Landaff has planted, on &s;ome high ground near Amble&s;ide, above an hundred acres with oak, a&s;h, elm, beech, &s;ycamore, Scotch fir, and larch. He is doubtful whether the climate be not too cold for any &s;ort of wood, except the fir and larch; the other kinds, after &s;even years growth, are alive, but &s;tunted; they &s;hoot a little in the Spring, but that &s;hoot peri&s;hes, as to its greate&s;t part, in the Winter.

<P>THE Wa&s;tes in this county are very exten&s;ive and valuable. They are depa&s;tured chiefly with &s;tocks of
<PB N="279" REF="298">&s;heep, which are managed in nearly the &s;ame way, whether the ground be in common, or in &s;everalty.</P>
<P>In Winter, all the &s;heep are brought down to the in|clo&s;ed fields, except the wedders, which, being thought able to endure the &s;everity of any &s;torm or fall of &s;now, are left to &s;hift for them&s;elves upon the wa&s;tes, where they remain till they are four years and a half old, when they are &s;old from 9s. to 13s. a head. Having dropped their lambs, the ewes, in the end of April, are &s;ent back to the wa&s;tes, where the whole flock pa&s;tures indi&s;crim|inately without an attendant. The lambs are &s;ometimes &s;uffered to wean them&s;elves; at others, the teats of the ewe are fa&s;tened up to her udder by a plai&s;ter of coar&s;e paper and pitch. The value of the wool, and the ex|pence of &s;alving, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e mentioned, &s;ect. 2.&mdash;chap. 13.</P>
<P><HI>Scotch Sheep.</HI>&mdash;Great numbers of Scotch hogs and din|monds are annually bought at Stag&s;hawbank fair in the month of June, and grazed on the wa&s;tes of this county. On &s;ome they are found to an&s;wer very badly; on o|thers they thrive well, and are ready for the grazier a year earlier than tho&s;e of the native breed. There is here a &s;trong prejudice in favour of the&s;e coar&s;e-woolled &s;heep, which there is every rea&s;on to believe is ill found|ed, the &s;ort now known under the name of the <HI>Cheviot</HI> breed being equally hardy, and much more profitable from the &s;uperior value of their fleece.</P>
<P><HI>Black Cattle.</HI>&mdash;In addition to all the&s;e &s;heep, numerous herds of black cattle are likewi&s;e to be &s;een upon the commons. A few of the&s;e are of the breed of the coun|ty, and the re&s;t are Scotch, either bought at Brough-hill fair in the end of September, and wintered on the low grounds and in the &s;traw-yard, or purcha&s;ed in the Spring from drovers, who fetch them from Galloway and Dumbarton. In Autumn, they are either &s;old to the
<PB N="280" REF="299">&s;outh-country drovers, or wintered and fattened in the county.</P>
<P><HI>Ponies.</HI>&mdash;A few ponies of the Scotch breed are reared upon the commons; but the practice not being general, it need not be dilated upon.</P>
<P><HI>Gee&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Great numbers of gee&s;e are bred upon the commons, and &s;old to the York&s;hire drovers at about 1s. 4d. a head.</P>
<P>It is generally under&s;tood that no per&s;on &s;hall &s;end to graze on any common more &s;tock than he can winter upon his e&s;tate or farm, in right of which he has a title to pa&s;turage on that common. This regulation, however, is little attended to, and the commons are almo&s;t always over&s;tocked to &s;uch a degree, that many per&s;ons do not think it worth while to avail them&s;elves of their right of commonage.</P>
<P>On &s;tinted pa&s;tures, it is very ordinary to hire out the right of keeping both cattle and &s;heep. A Summer's gra&s;s for an ox, or for ten &s;heep, on Fore&s;t Hall, and Mo&s;ley common, is let at 4s.; on a part of Troutbeck common, where no &s;heep are allowed to feed, an ox may be kept for 3s. 6d. and on another part of the &s;ame com|mon, <HI>an ox or ten &s;heep may remain all the year for &s;ix|pence.</HI></P>

<PB N="282" REF="301">avocation. In tho&s;e parts of We&s;tmoreland where &s;ummer-fallowing is not practi&s;ed, the land de&s;igned for barley and potatoes always receives the &s;table yard dung at the rate of 60, 80, or 100 &s;ingle-hor&s;e cart-loads an acre; and in Autumn, what remains is laid upon the hay-grounds, at a rate per acre con&s;iderably le&s;s.</P>
<P>On &s;ome few farms in the neighbourhood of Appleby, where &s;ummer-fallow and crops of turnips may almo&s;t be &s;aid to enter into the general cour&s;e, the dung is car|ried in Winter from the yard to the fields, and laid down in a heap, which is turned over two or three times, with a view to accelerate putrefaction. Twenty cart-loads per acre are laid upon the turnip land and the fallow, and its operation is always a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the addition of &s;eventy-five Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels of lime. Dung is &s;old at Ken|dall and at Milthrope for 1s. a cart load.</P>
<P><HI>Lime.</HI>&mdash;In mo&s;t parts of We&s;tmoreland, lime&s;tone is &s;ound in inexhau&s;tible plenty; but coals to burn it mu&s;t be carried from &s;uch a di&s;tance, that its application to the purpo&s;es of agriculture has not yet become general. When, by the projected canal to Kendall, coals &s;hall be brought into the heart of the county, its u&s;e mu&s;t &s;oon become univer&s;al.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes laid upon the land when it is in tillage, but for the mo&s;t part it is &s;pread upon the &s;urface of gra&s;s fields; and it has been found to &s;weeten &s;uch as are coar&s;e and benty amazingly.</P>
<P>In whatever way it is applied, and in whatever quan|tity, varying from 75 to 480 Winche&s;ter bu&s;hels an acre, it is always attended with wonderful effect. The price at the kilns is 3d. or 4d. a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P><HI>Compo&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;Much attention is paid to the making of compo&s;t dung hills in many parts of We&s;tmoreland. They are mo&s;t commonly &s;pread upon gra&s;s, and experi|ence has &s;hewn, that they at once improve its quality, and
<PB N="283" REF="302">check for years the progre&s;s of the mo&s;s. One hundred cart-loads of earth, rakings of the roads, mud, or rotten leaves, and fifty of dung, carefully mixed with 300 Win|che&s;ter bu&s;hels of lime, are laid upon three acres with great advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Marl.</HI>&mdash;This valuable manure was &s;carcely known in We&s;tmoreland, till about three years ago, when a &s;pecies of rock marl was di&s;covered on Bolton Common.

As a heifer of three years old can be &s;old for as much as an ox would fetch at four, it is rare to &s;ee a oullock of the country breed; but to judge from tho&s;e of all ages in the pa&s;tures at Lowther-hall, they are ex|cellent feeders, and po&s;&s;e&s;s, in an eminent degree, the very de&s;irable property of laying the fat upon their backs and other valuable parts.

<P><HI>Dairy</HI>&mdash;There are few counties in England, in which there is no great manufacturing town, where more milch cows are kept in proportion to its &s;ize, and where the produce of the dairy forms a greater part of the profits of the farmer. It may be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that he is particular in the choice of his cows, and that they are remarkable for giving a great quantity of milk. Neither &s;uppo&s;ition, however, is founded in truth. The farmer keeps ju&s;t &s;uch cows as he has bred, and they by no means yield &s;o much milk as would be expected from tho&s;e of the Dutch, or even the Scotch breed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ayr&s;hire breed is reckoned the be&s;t for milch cows in Scotland, particularly in the neighbourhood of Dunlop.

Farmers in the country ge|nerally e&s;timate the expence of keeping a milch cow at five pounds a-year, and the produce at eight pounds. Cows in the country are kept for the &s;ake of making but|ter, of which great quantitles, of an excellent quality, are &s;ent yearly to the London market in firkins of 56 lbs net, at from 30s. to 35s. each. In the immediate neighbour|hood of Kendall, the dairy turns out to better account by &s;elling the new milk, which is contracted for all the year at 1&frac12;d. a quart, being the &s;ame price which the London cow-keepers receive. The &s;kimmed milk is &s;old at one third part of that rate. The ordinary price of a good milch cow may be about ten pounds.</P>

<P>The breed of &s;heep, kept on the mountains and com|mons of We&s;tmoreland, is either native or a cro&s;s with Scotch rams. No attempt has yet been made to im|prove either the carca&s;e or the fleece. They are horned, dark or grey faced, thick pelted, with coar&s;e, &s;trong, hairy wool. The whole &s;tock upon a farm is herded to|gether, which is different from the practice in tho&s;e counties where &s;heep farming is thought to be the be&s;t under&s;tood.</P>
<P><HI>Wintering</HI>&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;tore-ma&s;ters who have not upon their own farms pa&s;tures &s;ufficient for the wintering of their young &s;heep, &s;end them to the low grounds from the 1&s;t November to 6th April, and pay 2s. a-head for tho&s;e that return. They are &s;o &s;ubject to the <HI>Black water (Sickne&s;s, or Middling-ill)</HI> that, at an average, ten out of an hundred die before Chri&s;tmas. After that, being very hardy, they &s;eldom die, and never of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Price.</HI>&mdash;The wedders are &s;old in October, when four years and a half old, from 9s. to 13s. each; the barren ewes at Lammas, from 8s. to 10s.; and the old ewes about 6s. to be wintered in the inclo&s;ed grounds, and fattened with their lambs the en&s;uing Summer.</P>
<P><HI>Salving.</HI>&mdash;In October, or the beginning of November, the whole flock is &s;alved &s;o heavily, that a gallon of tar and 16 lbs. of butter are expended upon thirty-five &s;heep. A man may be hired for this work at 1s. 8d. a-day, in which time he will not &s;alve above ten or a dozen; or he will undertake to &s;alve them at 2d. a-head. The whole expence is about &s;ixpence a-piece. It has been repeatedly tried to &s;ub&s;titute tobacco-liquor for the butter and tar, but it is generally imagined that the wool is better for the &s;heep having been &s;alved. Near Kirkby&s;teven, this
<PB N="287" REF="306">operation is performed with oil and tallow, at an expence of 4d a head.</P>
<P><HI>Wool.</HI>&mdash;The wool is worth, on an average of years in time of peace, 5d a pound. Part of it is &s;old to the ma|nufacturers of Kendall, and part of it to tho&s;e at Bradford, and other places in York&s;hire. The ewes are &s;aid to bear the be&s;t wool; and on an average of a flock fix fleeces weigh a &s;tone.</P>
<P><HI>Silverdale Breed.</HI>&mdash;Silverdale, a &s;mall di&s;trict in the neighbourhood of Millthrope, gives its name to the breed of &s;heep in this part of the county. The &s;oil is good, and on a lime&s;tone &s;tratum, and a branch of the &s;ea is nearly contiguous to it. They are horned, white faced, and clo&s;e woolled. They are &s;aid to be native, and are much &s;uperior to the common &s;ort, in regard both to fleece and carca&s;e. At the &s;ale of a farmer's &s;tock, in October 1793, the lambs of this breed brought 10s. 7d. a-piece, the dinmonds 17s. 1d. and the ewes at the age of three years and a half, 17s. 6d. or 17s. 8d. In the town&s;hips of Burton and Holme, where this breed is kept, five &s;heep at an average yield a &s;tone of wool, which is worth 8d. a pound. At a medium of the whole pari&s;h of Burton for eight years, from 1772 to 1779 in|clu&s;ive, it required &s;ix fleeces to weigh a &s;tone.</P>
<P>It is not unu&s;ual for the proprietor to be owner of the &s;heep upon the farm. In this ca&s;e the farmer is to be con&s;idered as little better than a &s;hepherd. The flock is valued at the time of his entry, and again at his removal, and the difference between the&s;e valuations is &s;ettled in money.</P>
<P><HI>Experiments.</HI>&mdash;1&s;t, Twenty Lincoln&s;hire <HI>Mugg</HI> ewes, that had been tupped by a ram of Mr Bakewell's breed, were brought into We&s;tmoreland in the month of De|cember 1789, and lambed in February 1790. The&s;e <HI>Mugg</HI> ewes were tupped in 1790 by a common We&s;tmore|land
<PB N="288" REF="307">ram, and the dinmonds produced by this cro&s;s have turned out the be&s;t &s;heep in the county, and weigh from 18 lbs. to 20 lbs. a quarter, and are thought to be &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the fir&s;t breed.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Six of the lambs produced from the tup of Mr Bakewell's breed and the <HI>Mugg</HI> ewes, were rams. Four of the&s;e rams were put to ewes of the common breed in the county, and the lambs &s;prung from this cro&s;s are much of the &s;ame &s;ize as the ordinary breed; but they are broader on the back, and finer in the wool. As the experiment has not yet been long tried, it mu&s;t be left to time to &s;how what the re&s;ult will be.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The lambs produced by the Lincoln&s;hire ewes, and their own lambs of February 1790, are not &s;o &s;trong as the&s;e lambs of 1790, which the &s;hepherd is di&s;po&s;ed to attribute to a &s;carcity of food in the Spring, rather than to any defect in the breed.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Thirty of this breed were left un&s;alved in 1791; they were in good condition, and had no &s;cab. The&s;e &s;ame were again left un&s;alved in 1792, and broke out in &s;cab early in 1793. It mu&s;t be remarked, that the &s;heep at the time of &s;alving in 1792 were not in &s;uch condition as in 1791; &s;o that it does not appear, from this experi|ment, that there is any nece&s;&s;ity for &s;alving &s;heep in good condition.</P>

Perhaps there may not be any thing peculiar in the mode of making hams in this county: but it is believed that a detail of the proce&s;s may be entered here without impropriety.</P>
<P>The hams are fir&s;t rubbed very hard, generally with bay &s;alt; by &s;ome they are covered clo&s;e up, by others they are left on a &s;tone bench to allow the brine to run off.

Having lain about a week, either on a &s;tone-bench, or in hog&s;heads among&s;t the brine, they are hung up by &s;ome in the chimney amid&s;t the &s;moke, whether of peats or coals; by others, in places where no &s;moke ever reaches them.

<P>In 1792, neat hams of 16 or 18 lbs. weight were &s;old as high as 5&frac12;d. per pound when green; when cured, in 1793, they were &s;old at 7&frac12;d. a-pound. It has been found by experiment that hams lo&s;e twenty per cent. of their weight in the curing.</P>

<P>LABOUR is dearer in We&s;tmoreland than it is in al|mo&s;t any of the counties either to the north or &s;outh of it. This probably is owing to the great number of &s;mall land|holders, or <HI>&s;tate&s;men</HI> above-mentioned, who doing the work upon their own e&s;tates, with their own hands and tho&s;e of their families, are perhaps di&s;inclined to labour for other people.</P>
<P><HI>Servants by the year.</HI>&mdash;A hind may be hired by the year at twenty pounds, a hou&s;e, a garden, and a patch of ground to grow potatoes; and an unmarried man at from ten to twelve guineas a-year, and board and wa&s;h|ing.</P>
<P><HI>By the day.</HI>&mdash;The wages of an ordinary labourer are from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 8d. a-day; he begins to work be|tween &s;ix and &s;even, re&s;ts an hour at dinner, and leaves it off between &s;ix and &s;even in the evening.&mdash;The la|bourers on the highway from Shap to Kendall receive
<PB N="292" REF="311">1s. 9d. a day for nine months in the year, and 1s. 6d. a-day for the other three months.</P>
<P><HI>By the month.</HI>&mdash;On the large farms, in the &s;ea&s;ons of hay and harve&s;t, it is not unu&s;ual to hire labourers by the month of four weeks, at the rate of 1l. 12s. 6d. and victuals. They breakfa&s;t on milk-pottage, and bread and chee&s;e, receive a pint of good beer in the forenoon, and another in the afternoon; they dine on meat boiled, ba|ked, or roa&s;ted, and potatoes or pudding; &s;up on cold meat, and have plenty of common beer to drink through the day. They begin in the morning as &s;oon as the corn is dry, re&s;t none but while at meals, and continue as late as they can &s;ee to work. Four men may cut, tie, and &s;took a cu&s;tomary acre in a day, leaving a &s;tubble from nine to fourteen inches in length.</P>
<P><HI>Cutting of corn per acre.</HI>&mdash;When done by the piece, the cutting of an acre by the &s;ickle, the &s;cythe not being u&s;ed in the reaping of any &s;ort of grain, may co&s;t 9s. and if the crop be very heavy, 10s. or even 10s. 6d.</P>
<P><HI>Cutting of hay per acre.</HI>&mdash;The price of mowing a cu&s;|tomary acre of gra&s;s varies from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. and a man u&s;ually mows an acre in a day.</P>
<P><HI>Per. day.</HI>&mdash;When hired by the day, a mower's wages may vary from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 10d. and victuals.</P>

At Millthrope a few are hired all the year at 1s. 10d. a-day, wet or dry. When they do their work by the piece, and furni&s;h every thing, they are paid 2s. or 2s. 6d. a &s;quare yard for a wall of two feet in thickne&s;s built with lime; if materials are furni&s;h|ed to their hand, they are paid 8d. or 10d. a-yard.

<P><HI>Thre&s;her.</HI>&mdash;A farmer's own &s;ervants generally thre&s;h out the corn. When per&s;ons are hired for this purpo&s;e, they receive about 1s. for thre&s;hing a load of &s;even and a half bu&s;hels of oats, and 1s. 3d. for that of barley; and from 4d. to 8d. a boll of rye, con&s;i&s;ting of two Winche&s;|ter bu&s;hels.</P>
<P><HI>Miller.</HI>&mdash;Farmers commonly have their meal made from oats of their own growing. The miller receives 4d. a|load for drying the oats. If they are good in quality, a load of &s;even and a half bu&s;hels will yield 176 pounds of meal, be&s;ides paying the miller his toll for grinding, which is gue&s;&s;ed to be about four per cent. Wheat is made into flour for 4d. a-bu&s;hel. Numberle&s;s &s;treams rendering the precarious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of windmills unnece&s;&s;ary, there is but one in the county, and it is employed in grinding bark for the tanners at Kendall.</P>

<P>It is not unu&s;ual to hear people exclaim again&s;t the en|crea&s;e of luxury, and the alteration that has taken place in the mode of living in their time. The labourer lives as well now as the farmer did forty or fifty years ago; the farmer as well as the man of &s;mall landed property; and &s;o on: And is this in any re&s;pect to be regretted, or is it not much better for them all? But per&s;ons generally cry out mo&s;t loudly again&s;t the rank immediately be|neath them, without recollecting that their own mode has been changed in nearly the &s;ame proportion as the one which they are &s;o ready to condemn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spencer's Travels.</NOTE></P>
<P>Fifty years ago the price of butcher-meat at Martinmas was from 1&frac14;d. to 2d. a pound in Burton market, and eighty bea&s;ts were &s;ometimes &s;laughtered in a day, and bought to be &s;alted for winter provi&s;ions. From that time, except a few at Chri&s;tmas and at Ea&s;ter, no cattle were killed
<PB N="295" REF="314">there till they were fattened upon the pa&s;tures in &s;um|mer. Farmers, in tho&s;e days, &s;eldom eat any butcher-meat; they lived on bread and butter, and what other little matters the farm afforded. Now labourers gene|rally breakfa&s;t on that very ancient food pottage, with the help of a little chee&s;e and bread; they dine on but|cher-meat and potatoes, or pudding; and &s;up on pota|toes, or pottage, or bread and chee&s;e.</P>
<P>The bread generally eaten in the county is made from oat-meal. Water and oat-meal are kneaded together in|to a pa&s;te without any leaven; this pa&s;te is rolled into a circular cake of about twenty inches in diameter, and is placed upon a thin flat plate of iron, called a <HI>girdle,</HI> un|der which a fire is put, and the cake thus baked goes by the name of <HI>clap</HI>-bread, and is to be &s;een at almo&s;t every table in the county. This very particular de&s;cription of baking cakes may appear too minute, or altogether un|nece&s;&s;ary, and it owes its place here to the reque&s;t of &s;ome per&s;ons of rank who wi&s;hed to &s;ee it recorded &s;omewhere. The meal is mo&s;tly ground to &s;uch a degree of finene&s;s that a mea&s;ure of &s;ixteen quarts will weigh &s;ixteen pounds. Farmers, labourers, and manufacturers u&s;ually have fif|teen cakes made from &s;ixteen pounds of meal, and as many baked in a day as will &s;erve their families for a month. Such of the gentry as eat this &s;ort of bread, mo&s;t of them now eating bread made from wheat, have it baked much more frequently, and al&s;o much thinner. A labouring man will eat &s;ixteen pounds of meal made into bread in a fortnight; the price of &s;ixteen pounds of meal is variable from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.; the medium is 2s. which gives 1s. a-week for each labourer for bread; his cottage and his fuel co&s;t at lea&s;t as much more. His wages for three-quarters of a-year are 9s. a-week, and 8 s. a-week for the other quarter; but making allowance for broken days, 8s. a-week may be con&s;idered as the full amount of
<PB N="296" REF="315">the price of his labour; and indeed a good labourer may be hired by the year at that rate. Hence there will re|main 6 s. a-week for the labour of the man, for the re|mainder of his own &s;u&s;tenance, the &s;u&s;tenance of his fa|mily, and the cloathing of them all.</P>
<P>The difference in the price of provi&s;ions in a county &s;o &s;mall as We&s;tmoreland, cannot be very great. They are, however, &s;omewhat cheaper in the north and ca&s;t parts than they are in the &s;outh parts, which are more within the reach of the markets of Lanca&s;ter and Liver|pool. Beef in Kendall market, in the month of Octo|ber 1793, was &s;old at 3d. or 4d. a-pound, and a choice cut at 4&frac12;d.; in &s;pring it often ri&s;es to 6d. a-pound. Mutton, which in &s;pring often ri&s;es to 7d. a-pound, was &s;old at 3d. 3&frac12;d. or 4d. Pork was &s;old at 3d. or 4d. As all the bull calves are carried to market, veal is for the mo&s;t part cheaper than the other kinds of butcher meat, and yet in &s;pring it is &s;ometimes &s;old as high as 5d. a-pound. Potatoes brought 1s. 4d. a bu&s;hel, or 5s. 6d. or 6s. a-load; in &s;pring they are often &s;old at nearly the double of the&s;e prices. Oat-meal is bought in &s;ome places by a mea&s;ure of &s;ixteen quarts, at a price which fluctuates from 1 s. 4d. to 2 s. 6d.; in others by a peck of 20 quarts, which in &s;ummer 1793 was worth 3s. Butter was &s;old from 7d. to 9d. a-pound; in winter the price &s;eldom ri&s;es above 11d.; a &s;tone of 16 lbs. of 20 ounces, co&s;ts 11s. 6d. and a firkin of 56 lbs. neat, from 30s. to 35s. Chee&s;e in the country co&s;ts 3d. a pound, and new milk 1d. a-quart, which in Kendall is contracted for all the year at 1&frac12; d.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 1.</HI>&mdash;Arable Lands.</HEAD>
<P>CLOVER. In many counties of England the land is &s;own with gra&s;s &s;eeds, and left to lie for &s;ome years with a view to refre&s;h and enable it to bear crops of corn; but in We&s;tmoreland it is ploughed and &s;own with corn in or|der to prepare it for gra&s;s. When it hath been cropped for three years, and it is judged that the &s;oil is &s;ufficient|ly
<PB N="303" REF="322">reduced, and that the mo&s;s is quite de&s;troyed, the land is left to it&s;elf to gra&s;s over. The fir&s;t crop of hay is ne|ver either weighty or good in quality; the &s;econd is ge|nerally very &s;uperior in both the&s;e re&s;pects to the fir&s;t, and &s;o favourable are the climate and the &s;oil to the growth of gra&s;s, that the third crop is often &s;o abundant as to be let for two or three pounds per acre, and of a quality &s;o excellent, that in &s;everal places cattle are fat|tened upon it in Winter for the markets of Lanca&s;ter and Liverpool. But even the&s;e be&s;t crops are far inferior in point of value to tho&s;e that would be produced by the &s;ame fields, were their natural aptitude to grow gra&s;s di|rected to the production of clover and rye-gra&s;s. The prejudice that prevails almo&s;t univer&s;ally in We&s;tmore|land again&s;t the&s;e artificial plants is a great ob&s;tacle to the improvement of the hu&s;bandry of the county, and mu&s;t be overcome before the arable lands can be brought to that degree of cultivation of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that hay made of clover and rye-gra&s;s is much coar&s;er than that which is made of the natural gra&s;&s;es; and that the&s;e artificial plants giving place to the natural ones, peri&s;h at the end of two or three years, and there|fore ought never to be &s;own at all.</P>
<P>The opinion is conceived to be ill founded which holds that hay made of &s;own gra&s;&s;es is bad in quality; long ex|perience and continued practice having &s;hown that hor&s;es are very fond of &s;uch hay, and that when even fed upon it alone they are able to do a great deal of hard work. It can hardly be &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted that hay made of the tra&s;h produced &s;pontaneou&s;ly by the land the two fir&s;t years after it has been cropped with corn is better than hay made of clover and rye-gra&s;s. The artificial gra&s;&s;es &s;el|dom or never peri&s;h at once at the end of either the &s;e|cond or third year: they di&s;appear gradually, making room for the natural herbage to occupy their place, which
<PB N="304" REF="323">it is imagined it would be found upon trial to do with much more profit to the farmer than would have accrued to him by managing his lands in the ordinary way; for the &s;uperior value of the hay the fir&s;t two years would far more than reimbur&s;e him for the expence of the gra&s;s &s;eeds, and he might &s;till have his favourite natural hay after the&s;e had died entirely out.</P>
<P>This is &s;tated upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the field was to be allowed to lie eight or ten years in gra&s;s, as is the cu&s;|tom at pre&s;ent. If it were to be broken up at the end of the fir&s;t or &s;econd year, it would be &s;ound in good con|dition for bearing a crop of corn, the roots of clover, it is well known, being a great improver of the &s;oil: but this way of cropping the lands will enter with more propriety into that part where an alteration of the pre&s;ent cour&s;e will be &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the year 1792, Mr Smith at Henridding in the pari&s;h of Burton, &s;owed a clo&s;e containing exactly two acres and a half Lanca&s;hire mea&s;ure, with 48 lbs. of red clover &s;eed among&s;t a crop of barley, for which the land had been &s;lightly manured after fallow wheat. This field is in Lanca&s;hire, but being &s;ituated within an hundred yards of the county of We&s;tmoreland, it may be mentioned here without impropriety, and it is &s;elected merely becau&s;e the particulars re&s;pecting it are better known to the writer of this Report than tho&s;e in regard to any field of clover in the county that was the object of his &s;urvey. It was mown in the month of July 1793, and it then yielded a crop of twenty-two &s;ingle-hor&s;e cart-loads of hay. It was mown a &s;econd time in September, and produced eighteen of the &s;ame cart-loads. It was depa&s;tured with nine &s;heep from the time the la&s;t crop was carried off till the beginning of November, and the foggage was then tol|erably good. Let the mo&s;t &s;trenuous advocates for natural gra&s;s, &s;ay whether they ever had a crop &s;o valu|able!</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="324">Where the land is intended to be depa&s;tured, the ar|gument will apply with treble force; and the decided pre|ference given by cattle of all kinds to the green herbage of the artificial, over that of the natural gra&s;s, ought to remove every doubt from the minds even of tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the pre&s;ent practice.</P>
<P>In front of Carus Wil&s;on, E&s;q.'s new hou&s;e near Kirk|by Lon&s;dale, there lies a field of &s;ixteen acres, which was &s;own with gra&s;s &s;eeds among&s;t a crop of barley in the year 1792. It was depa&s;tured in 1793, and maintained <HI>three times</HI> more &s;tock than he would have expected it to main|tain, had it been left to it&s;elf in the ordinary way. Far|mers, the mo&s;t prejudiced again&s;t &s;own gra&s;&s;es, &s;aw and confe&s;&s;ed the force of the experiment; and, it is not to be doubted, will follow an example which tends &s;o materially to promote their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The cultivation of clover is perhaps the greate&s;t im|provement in the art of farming which has been di&s;co|vered in modern times; and it is equally matter of regret and of &s;urpri&s;e, that what is at once &s;o ea&s;y and &s;o profit|able is not yet become univer&s;al, and it furni&s;hes a &s;trong in&s;tance of the difficulty with which old habits and pre|judices are rooted out, even when &s;elf-intere&s;t is concern|ed in their extirpation.</P>
<P><HI>Turnips.</HI>&mdash;The climate and &s;oil of the vallies of We&s;t|moreland are well &s;uited to the cultivation of turnips, which mu&s;t be carried on to a con&s;iderable extent before the agriculture of the county can be improved in any material degree. Experience has &s;hown that this crop, and the mode of hu&s;bandry u&s;ually connected with it, are able, not only to fertili&s;e particular farms, but even to, improve whole counties. The mo&s;t profitable and the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome way of di&s;po&s;ing of this crop is to fatten &s;heep with it. A cu&s;tomary acre of turnips, if the crop
<PB N="306" REF="325">is good, will feed twenty-five &s;heep weighing &s;ixteen pounds a quarter, from 1&s;t November to 1&s;t April; even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;heep made no advance in the&s;e five months, the very encrea&s;e of the price of the mutton from 4d. to 5&frac12;d. or 6d. a pound, would bring a profit to the farmer as con&s;iderable as it is ea&s;ily calculated. When to this there is added the value of what they would gain in point of weight, the profit, it is hoped, will appear to be &s;o great as to make the de&s;ire to grow turnips irre&s;i&s;tible, and quickly to increa&s;e the quantity an hundred-fold beyond what it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Where the land is very dry the &s;heep may be penned upon a &s;mall part of the field of turnips, and &s;hifted to another as tho&s;e in the fir&s;t part are eaten up; but if there is a field of gra&s;s near at hand, the &s;uperior im|provement of the &s;heep will pay for the labour of car|rying the turnips to be eaten on that field where they will lie dry and clean, and where the turnips will be le&s;s trampled on and abu&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Rotation of Crops.</HI>&mdash;It is the general opinion of farmers in We&s;tmoreland, that their lands are better &s;uited for gra&s;s than for bearing crops of corn, and they are plough|ed for three or four years, not with an expectation that the corn will be more profitable than the gra&s;s, but in order to renovate them for gra&s;s, and to de&s;troy the mo&s;s, which in a few years over-runs all their ley grounds: but there are &s;ome who are per&s;uaded, that the neat profits of the three or four years the lands are under crop, u&s;ually exceed the profits of any other three or four years, while the &s;ame lands lie in gra&s;s, and they think that their fer|tility for the production of either gra&s;s or corn would be injured by ploughing for a longer term, or after &s;horter intervals of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether the lands under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem are mo&s;t profitable to the farmer when they are in corn or in gra&s;s,
<PB N="307" REF="326">it is not nece&s;&s;ary now to enquire, becau&s;e, with all due deference to the general practice and opinion of a whole county, it is pre&s;umed that a mode of hu&s;bandry and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops may be pointed out, which upon trial would be found far more profitable than tho&s;e at pre&s;ent followed.</P>
<P>The uniting what may be called the Clover and the Turnip Hu&s;bandry is the be&s;t method hitherto di&s;covered of keeping dry lands in a &s;tate of continual fertility, and for this the light and friable &s;oil of the vallies of We&s;t|moreland is well calculated. In&s;tead of the common ro|tation of oats, barley, and oats again, and then leaving the land to gra&s;s over of it&s;elf, the following cour&s;e of crops might be introduced with advantage, both to the public and the individual. When an old clo&s;e of good land is broken up it &s;hould be &s;own with oats, as is done at pre&s;ent; after the oats it &s;hould be manured and &s;own with turnips in drills thirty inches a&s;under, &s;o as to admit of being hor&s;e-hoed; next with barley or oats, and always with gra&s;s &s;eeds at the rate of about &s;ixteen pounds of clover, and a Winche&s;ter bu&s;hel of rye-gra&s;s to the &s;tatute acre. If it is intended to pa&s;ture the field, the gra&s;s &s;eeds can hardly be &s;own too thick; if it is to be made into hay, the quantity of &s;eeds above-mentioned will be found am|ply &s;ufficient. The fir&s;t year's crop of gra&s;s may be mown twice, or after the fir&s;t cutting it may be eaten by fattening cattle; or it may be eaten by &s;heep till the be|ginning of June, &s;aved after that and mown in Augu&s;t, and it will &s;till produce a valuable crop of foggage or af|ter-math. It &s;hould be depa&s;tured with cattle or &s;heep the &s;econd year, and the third year likewi&s;e, if it &s;hall be thought proper to keep the field &s;o long in gra&s;s.</P>
<P>This cour&s;e would pre&s;erve the land in a &s;tate of per|petual <HI>health and vigour,</HI> did it not, taking plea&s;ure in va|riety, di&s;like a too frequent repetition of the &s;ame crops.
<PB N="308" REF="327">After &s;ome rounds it will be proper to encrea&s;e the quan|tity of clover &s;eed, and at la&s;t to bring it &s;eldomer into &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for if too often &s;own it will be rejected entire|ly. When this is apprehended the cour&s;e may be varied or lengthened by the introduction of a crop of pea&s;e, or of drilled beans where the land is deep and moi&s;t, and wheat after either of the&s;e, or after a clean Summer-fallow, or by leaving the land &s;ome years longer in gra&s;s than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>When it &s;hall be proved and known that potatoes are a cheap and nouri&s;hing food for hor&s;es, the demand for that valuable root will become nearly as unbounded as that for turnips is; and even although they exhau&s;t the land, they may then be introduced into the cour&s;e with much advantage to the farmer.</P>
<P>It is not pretended that the rotation of crops here re|commended would &s;uit all the arable lands of We&s;tmore|land; but it is believed that, on a very large proportion of them, it might be followed with a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. The cold, wet, &s;tiff &s;oils &s;hould be Summer-fallowed in|&s;tead of being cropped with turnips; wheat &s;hould be &s;own after the fallow, and clover, or oats, and then clo|ver after the wheat; but it is impo&s;&s;ible, and were it po&s;&s;ible it would be improper, in a work of this general nature, to mention how all the varieties of &s;oil &s;hould be treated; and to de&s;cend to the minutiae of ploughing and &s;owing, and ten thou&s;and little matters that continually de|mand the farmer's attention, and that are always varying with the weather. In the&s;e his own ingenuity mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and there all his ingenuity will be nece&s;&s;ary; for his art, though apparently ea&s;y, is attended with a thou&s;and difficulties.</P>

<P>There is room for great improvement in the manage|ment of &s;heep, as well upon private e&s;tates as upon the
<PB N="309" REF="328">commons; but while the&s;e la&s;t continue in their pre&s;ent deplorable &s;tate, it would be in vain to attempt any altera|tion upon their &s;tocks. The ca&s;e, however, is different with &s;tore farms properly &s;o called, where the breed or treatment of the &s;heep differs very little from that of tho&s;e upon commons, although there can be no rea&s;onable doubt of their being well adapted to the keeping a far more profitable &s;ort than is to be found there at pre&s;ent. There is no weight whatever in the argument which has been often u&s;ed again&s;t the introduction of &s;uch a breed from the &s;carcity of food and the coldne&s;s of the climate, the Briti&s;h Wool Society having proved that <Q>the fine&s;t breeds of Spain or of England will thrive on the wil|de&s;t of the Cheviot hills, and that very fine-woolled breeds may be propagated on the mo&s;t mountainous di|&s;tricts of Scotland.</Q> There are numbers of &s;heep at the Feroe i&s;lands, which lie in latitude 63, and even in Iceland, part of which is beyond the Arctic circle; they are to be found in great abundance on every farm; and there nature &s;ports in a great &s;uperfluity of horns, as if the &s;canty pittance of food which the animal can pick up in that bleak and frozen climate were more than &s;uffi|cient for the &s;upport of the carca&s;e and the fleece.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive and valuable commons of We&s;tmore|land loudly demand the interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature in a country that boa&s;ts of attention to its intere&s;t. Some immediate alteration in their &s;tate, whether by divi&s;ion or by &s;ale, cannot be too eagerly pur&s;ued, nor too &s;trongly inculcated; nor can it be too generally made known, that there are many wealthy people living near &s;ome of the be&s;t commons in the county, (which is a point of great importance) who do not think it worth while to avail them&s;elves of their right of pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on &s;ees the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome material change with regard to the commons; and now that thinking men

But it cannot be expected that any mea&s;ure however wi&s;e, or any propo|&s;al however advantageous, can meet with univer&s;al appro|bation. It will probably be reprobated by &s;ome who&s;e prejudices it will alarm, and with who&s;e little intere&s;ts it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to cla&s;h. Till &s;omething of greater con|&s;equence be accompli&s;hed, the reduction of the &s;tint, where &s;uch is already e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a moderate &s;tint upon commons that are perfectly free, ought not to be delayed one hour; for at pre&s;ent they are of little, if of any u&s;e, either to tho&s;e having a right of commonage, or to the nation at large.</P>
<P>A general inclo&s;ure-bill for the whole kingdom would &s;ave the expence of &s;eparate applications to parliament for the divi&s;ion of particular commons, but there are many barren and rocky commons that would not be in any wi&s;e benefited by inclo&s;ure; and although the in|tere&s;ts of a few individuals ought to give way to tho&s;e of the community, there are numerous in&s;tances where both would be injured by the operation of &s;uch a bill; for it would at once be ruinous to many proprietors to be oblig|ed to inclo&s;e each his &s;hare, often at an expence greater not only than the value of that &s;hare, but in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces greater than the value of the fee-&s;imple of that farm or e&s;tate in right of which he claims, and prejudicial to the public, by interrupting the &s;heep-walks upon the mountainous di&s;tricts, which ought to be as free and open as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The principal part of the &s;tock kept upon the com|mons con&s;i&s;ts of &s;heep, either of the breed of the county, or brought from Scotland. The ewes are wintered in
<PB N="311" REF="330">the inclo&s;ures, and &s;ent back to the commons in April; the wedder hoggrels are always wintered the fir&s;t year on the low grounds at the expence of 2s. a head, are &s;ent back to the commons about the &s;ame time with the ewes, and remain there till they are &s;old to the grazier. They may fetch at an average 11s. a piece; add to this the value of the wool, and 15s. may be about the &s;um received for every wedder &s;heep that arrives at the age of four years and a half.</P>
<P>Scotch hogs are bought at about 8s. 6d. a piece, and are kept two years upon the commons, when they may be worth 10s. 6d or 11s.; add to this the price of three fleeces of wool, and the whole &s;um received for every &s;heep delivered may be about 14s.; from this &s;ubtract the original price, two years intere&s;t of the money, expence of herding for the fir&s;t two months, of thrice wa&s;hing and clipping, of twice &s;alving, the value of the ri&s;k of bad payment from the drover or grazier, the lo&s;s by &s;traying, and, what is often much more con&s;iderable, by death, and &s;ay what profit remains.</P>
<P>It has been computed that one third of all the &s;heep in We&s;tmoreland died in 1792. Great calamities are often exaggerated, though no doubt the lo&s;s mu&s;t have been prodigious when it was e&s;timated &s;o high.</P>
<P>Twenty &s;hillings are reckoned an ordinary profit for keeping a Scotch bea&s;t a year; &s;ubtract from this the price of wintering on the low grounds and in the &s;traw-yard, intere&s;t of the co&s;t, value of the ri&s;k of drovers, lo&s;s by death from fatigue e&s;timated at 2&frac12; per cent, by di&s;ea&s;e, and now and then by one tumbling into a peat|mo&s;s, and &s;ay what advantage ari&s;es from this adven|ture.</P>
<P>Seven &s;hillings and &s;ixpence are thought an ordinary profit for keeping a little Scotch bea&s;t on a common from May to October; make the &s;ame deductions as in the for|mer
<PB N="312" REF="331">article, with the exception of the value of the Win|ter's keeping, and &s;ee how little remains for the rent of the land.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to place this matter in a more &s;triking point of view than by repeating, that on &s;everal commons the liberty of keeping an ox, or ten &s;heep, for a whole year, may be hired for <HI>&s;ixpence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Improvement of Wa&s;tes by Liming.</HI>&mdash;Great portions of many of the&s;e might be improved at a &s;mall expence by the application of lime, which is found in mo&s;t parts of the county, and might be cultivated with the certainty of great advantage. When ploughed, great care ought to be taken to adopt a proper &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops, and to lay the lands down with gra&s;s &s;eeds in a very few years; becau&s;e, when exhau&s;ted by over-cropping, they are reduced to a wor&s;e &s;tate than they were in before, and there is no way yet di&s;covered of preparing lands for a repetition of a hearty do&s;e of lime.</P>
<P><HI>By Paring and Burning.</HI>&mdash; Many of the level moory parts might be converted into arable lands by paring and burning, which are well under&s;tood by &s;everal per&s;ons in the county, and have been practi&s;ed with more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s on &s;ome private e&s;tates.</P>
<P><HI>By Planting.</HI>&mdash; There are many thou&s;ands of acres ut|terly incapable of cultivation by the plough; and, in the paper prefixed, the Bi&s;hop of Landaff has &s;hown, in a manner equally ingenious and novel, with what advan|tage the&s;e might be covered with wood. It is well known that trees flouri&s;h with the greate&s;t vigour on &s;oils far more barren, and in climates much colder, than that of We&s;tmoreland. There are &s;tately oaks at Niagara, which, though not in a high latitude, experience a degree of cold in Winter far beyond what is ever felt in this coun|try. On the we&s;tern coa&s;t of America, in latitude 61&deg;, the very &s;ummits of the hills are covered with wood, and
<PB N="313" REF="332">there is plenty of trees at Norton's Sound in latitude 64&deg; 55&Prime;; and timber for the u&s;e of &s;hips in the Briti&s;h navy has been cut even at Kamt&s;chatka, the very end of the earth, where the &s;oil is barren in the extreme, and covered with Summer &s;now, and where the Winters are rigorous beyond the conception of an inhabitant of Europe.</P>
<P>That We&s;tmoreland has been a wooded county, is evident from trees found in mo&s;&s;es on the highe&s;t hills; and &s;tatutes and regulations made long after the Conque&s;t, &s;ince which time the climate has not been changed for the wor&s;e, are full of the mention of fore&s;ts, and chaces, and parks, and ma&s;tage, and pannage, and vert, and veni&s;on, and greenhue, and regarders, and fore&s;ters, and verderors, and an hundred other names and titles re&s;pecting the pre|&s;ervation of the woods and the game.</P>
<P>The valuable plantations at Lowther-hall, the &s;eat of the Earl of Lon&s;dale, &s;how how well calculated the &s;oil and climate of We&s;tmoreland &s;till are for the growth of timber, which, it cannot be que&s;tioned, would thrive over all the county as well now as it did five hundred years ago. The profits of planting are &s;o di&s;tant, and &s;o few per&s;ons, looking eighty or an hundred years beyond the pre&s;ent day, are willing to &s;acrifice a paltry intere&s;t for the &s;ake of a remote po&s;terity, that perhaps it may be nece&s;&s;ary for Government to encourage by premiums what in the end would turn out &s;o greatly to the advantage of the com|munity. The&s;e might be di&s;tributed with much propri|ety by the Board of Agriculture, who&s;e income &s;eems to be far too moderate for the &s;upport of &s;o important an e&s;tabli&s;hment, the objects of who&s;e &s;uperintendence are innumerable, and the field of who&s;e operations is exten|&s;ive as the i&s;land it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To the north of Shap lies a very exten&s;ive common called the Scars, where between two and three thou&s;and
<PB N="314" REF="333">acres of level white land, in a &s;tate of nature, offend the eye of every traveller, and cry aloud for improvement, the means of which it contains in immen&s;e quantities of lime|&s;tone upon its very &s;urface. It is more than twenty years &s;ince an act of parliament was obtained for a divi&s;ion of this common, and that it has not been carried into execu|tion is the more to be regretted, as, in the opinion of very judicious per&s;ons in the neighbourhood, a large portion of it might be ea&s;ily made as valuable as the little clo&s;es of Shap, which are let from 30s. to 40s. an acre.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh of Shap lies another common called the Fells, which is, in general, incapable of cultivation by the plough, but it is not ill &s;uited to the maintenance of &s;heep; and the remains of the celebrated <HI>Shap-thorn,</HI> near the road to Orton, &s;how that plantations would &s;ucceed even on tho&s;e places of it which are mo&s;t expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Near the mouth of the river Kent there is a mar&s;h of con&s;iderable extent, common to Haver&s;ham and Mill|thrope, and, like all the other commons in We&s;tmoreland, greatly over&s;tocked. It would not be difficult to bank off the &s;ea from this mar&s;h, and to convert it into corn fields; but if this were thought not advi&s;eable, its value might be in&s;tantly more than doubled by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a moderate &s;tint, or &s;till farther increa&s;ed by a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Part of Cro&s;by common might be ea&s;ily converted into arable and good pa&s;ture land, and two clumps of trees, of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, prove that its wor&s;t parts might be planted with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From Cro&s;by and Meaburn, a dry level common ex|tends to within three miles of Appleby. It is covered with heath, and is capable of various modes of improve|ment.</P>
<P>The commons of Knock, Newbigging, Kirkby-Thore, and Marton, lie contiguous, and form a tract of &s;everal thou&s;ands of acres, dry, &s;oft, and improveable. A great
<PB N="315" REF="334">part of the&s;e is covered with &s;trong brackens, and is &s;u|perior in quality to the &s;oil of many farms in the neigh|bourhood, and well &s;uited to the cultivation of turnips and clover.</P>
<P>This &s;pecimen of the commons in We&s;tmoreland will, it is hoped, be deemed &s;ufficient; for it would be tedious and painful to enumerate them all. It is difficult to be|hold the de&s;olate &s;tate in which they lie, without &s;urpri&s;e at the nation having &s;o long delayed taking mea&s;ures for their improvement. The wa&s;tes and commons in this county, and throughout England in general, have been elegantly called <HI>a public trea&s;ure in the hands of private per&s;ons;</HI> it is to be hoped that the time is not very di&s;|tant when this important trea&s;ure &s;hall be opened, and its contents &s;hall prove equally beneficial to the individual, and to the public at large.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to look forward without emotion to that day when the&s;e neglected wa&s;tes &s;hall have received that degree of improvement of which they are &s;u&s;cepti|ble; when they &s;hall wave with valuable crops of corn, bleat with profitable flocks, or be clothed with &s;tately tim|ber; when every little rill &s;hall be turned out of its na|tural cour&s;e to fertili&s;e the neighbouring plain; and when there may be &s;een in every corner the indu&s;trious hu&s;|bandman, at once enriching him&s;elf and advantaging the community in a manner the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial!</P>
<P>Contemplating the matter in this view, who but mu&s;t exclaim, what a noble field for exertion! What a &s;ource of national wealth yet in &s;tore! <Q>More certain than the profits of commerce, more permanent than tho&s;e of manufactures!</Q></P>
<P>Such are the reflections and ob&s;ervations that occurred in a Survey of the &s;tate of the &s;tock and hu&s;bandry in the county of We&s;tmoreland, made in the months of October and November 1793, at the reque&s;t of the newly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
<PB N="316" REF="335">Board of Agriculture. What &s;ucce&s;s has attended the attempt to place this important matter in a ju&s;t light, o|thers will judge; but it will be doing no more than ju&s;|tice to admit, that no pains have been &s;pared in the exe|cution of this ta&s;k, which others might have performed with more ability, but not with greater alacrity or zeal.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conclude this Report without men|tioning to the Board the very flattering manner in which the per&s;on commi&s;&s;ioned by them to make this Survey, was received by all ranks and de&s;criptions of per&s;ons in the county of We&s;tmoreland. Every po&s;&s;ible aid was given by the two re&s;pectable Members of the Board re&s;i|dent in the county. The other individuals who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him are too numerous to be di&s;criminated; but the wri|ter of this paper will ever remember their very polite at|tention with gratitude, and his &s;hort re&s;idence in that part of the kingdom with peculiar feelings of plea&s;ure and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>What gratitude is due to HIM, who fir&s;t called the at|tention of the nation to its mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, and who&s;e unremitted efforts are directed to promote the good of his country! How well does He de&s;erve, and what a &s;ure road has He cho&s;en to immortal fame, that will &s;ur|vive the ravages of time, and &s;mile at the fleeting celebrity of martial atchievements!</P>

<P>TO the note, page 68, the reader is de&s;ired to add,&mdash; The re&s;ult of this experiment was, that, in the harve&s;t of 1797, &s;uch parts of the wheat, the &s;eed of which was pickled and limed, as well as that which was pickled and not limed, was nearly free from &s;mut; but that which was neither pickled nor limed, had &s;mutted ears in a|bundance, at lea&s;t a hundred times more than the other: it may be proper to ob&s;erve, the &s;eed was purpo&s;ely taken with a few balls of &s;mut in it.&mdash;This experiment is deci&s;ively in favour of &s;teeping in chamberlye.</P>
<P>The following addition is al&s;o de&s;ired to be made, (at the bottom of page 69.) to the paragraph on drilling, ending, "on moi&s;t &s;oils."&mdash;We have lately found it mo&s;t convenient to yoke two hor&s;es to the drill, one going in each furrow, and to drill &s;even rows upon a ridge, of 80 to 84 inches wide, when the intervals are 10&frac12; or 11 inches; and 90 inches wide, when the intervals are 12 inches.</P>
<P>With the hor&s;es yoked in this manner in a five-row drill, ten rows may be &s;own upon ridges 10&frac34; feet wide, leaving a &s;pace on the top of the ridge, about 14 inches wide, for one of the hor&s;es to travel on; this is &s;uppo&s;ing the intervals 12 inches wide; but, if the intervals be 10&frac12; inches, then the ridges may be 9&frac34; feet wide.&mdash;A light harrow is fixed to the drill, to cover in the &s;eed.</P>
