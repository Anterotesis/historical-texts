<HEAD><HI>CHAP IV.</HI> Of the Provinces of Zealand, Utrecht, and Frie&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>ZEALAND con&s;i&s;ts entirely of i&s;lands, formed by the outlets of the Scheld; it is bounded on the north by the province of Holland, ea&s;t by Brabant, &s;outh by Flanders, and we&s;t by the North Sea; its name &s;ufficiently indicates its po&s;ition. It is &s;aid, that the&s;e i&s;lands formerly joined, and were &s;eparated from the continent only by a &s;mall channel, like that which &s;eparates the i&s;land of Angle&s;ea from Wales: this pro|vince extends thirty miles in length, and twenty in breadth: its population is by no means con&s;iderable; the number of inhabitants are e&s;timated at ninety thou&s;and. The harbours in general are good, and very conveniently &s;ituated for commerce.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts are defended from the violence of the &s;ea by &s;and-hills, and on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide by large dykes, which have a breadth of 25 German ells at bottom, and are &s;o wide at top, that
<PB N="4" REF="5">
two carriages may pa&s;s a-brea&s;t; their height is al&s;o proportionable to their thickne&s;s; notwith&s;tanding which, in high tides and &s;tormy weather, the waves force a pa&s;&s;age, and even flow over them in many places.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction of the&s;e dykes is calculated to have co&s;t 17 millions of florins. The annual repairs of them alone, are &s;uppo&s;ed to ab&s;orb all the profits of the lands. If placed in a &s;traight line, they would form a length of forty miles.</P>
<P>Though the inhabitants of the other provinces and foreigners complain of the atmo&s;phere being thick and heavy, yet no people enjoy a more confirmed &s;tate of health, or look better, than the natives who are born and bred up here. The &s;oil, too, is very fruitful, and famed for its excellent wheat, as likewi&s;e for its mad|der, the cultivation of which furni&s;hes great employ|ment to the inhabitants of Zealand. It abounds al&s;o in good fruits, and its rich pa&s;tures are covered with flocks of fine &s;heep. The &s;ea &s;upplies them with plenty of fi&s;h, particularly with oy&s;ters, lob&s;ters, and mu&s;cles, all of uncommon &s;ize and goodne&s;s. Fuel is very &s;carce here; but this is in &s;ome mea&s;ure remedi|ed by the quantities of coal imported from England and Scotland.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are reckoned the mo&s;t wealthy in all the Netherlands, in a great mea&s;ure owing to their traffic by &s;ea; and for this indeed they have every con|venience
<PB N="5" REF="6">
that can be de&s;ired. Their numerous pri|vateers in time of war, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have brought great wealth into the country.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this province is extremely rich, but not applied to pa&s;turage. There is much corn, which ap|pears to be fine and clean; and al&s;o &s;ome large fields of madder, which is a particular article of culture in this country; it grows on flat lands, formed into re|gular oblongs by &s;mall trenches, and in rows about a foot a&s;under. It is an odd &s;traggling plant; they keep it very clean by repeated hoeing and weeding, for &s;carce a &s;ingle weed is to be &s;een in a large field; it lyes three years in the ground, unle&s;s the growth is very quick, and then it comes up in two; the root is its valuable part, which, when dry, makes a very fine dye. It is e&s;teemed a more profitable plant than any other article of hu&s;bandry; but the ground mu&s;t be picked for it, as it will grow only on certain kinds of &s;oil. The great point is, to find out land that is both dry and fertile; for no &s;oil can be too rich for it. Great quantities are exported from Zealand to Lon|don, as the growth does not &s;ucceed well in this coun|try, notwith&s;tanding the great endeavours that have been u&s;ed to cultivate it.</P>
<P>An acre of madder growing near Middleburgh, will produce, one time with another, from three to four hundred florins, if it is in the ground for three years; but then the expences of the management of it, run
<PB N="6" REF="7">
very high, and &s;everal con&s;iderable buildings are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for manufacturing it: but it is notwith&s;tanding e&s;teemed a more profitable article than either corn or gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Middleburg, which is the capital of the province of Zealand, is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in the United Provinces; it is very large and well built; the &s;treets are broad, regular, well paved, and kept &s;o very clean and neat, that they are frequently &s;trewed over with &s;and, and it is cu&s;tomary here for the women to walk about in &s;lippers; the public edifices are &s;triking, and &s;ome of them very magnificent. Here are twenty churches, among which that called the New Church, is mo&s;t admired for its beauty; it has a very hand&s;ome cupola over it, and there is great merit in the archi|tecture. Merchant ve&s;&s;els come into the center of the city, by means of a canal, a mile and a half long from the &s;ea: &s;o that Middleburg enjoys a very great commerce, particularly in Spani&s;h and French wines, which are reckoned the &s;taple of the place.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of this place are painted of different colours, &s;ome red, &s;ome white, &s;ome green, and &s;ome blue. And every year, as in North Holland, they are all fre&s;h painted. In the &s;ummer, it is u&s;ual for the maids to get up every morning at 6 o'clock to wa&s;h the out&s;ide of the windows, by &s;quirting water again&s;t them, which they throw up from pails as high
<PB N="7" REF="8">
as the &s;econd floor; and it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee a range of indu&s;trious wenches through a whole &s;treet, &s;triving who can &s;quirt the highe&s;t and the furthe&s;t.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hing, the town of next notice in this province, was famous &s;ome years &s;ince for the immen&s;e contra|band trade that was carried on with this country in teas and brandies; and to which the commutation-act was a death blow. Several of the Dutch men of war are laid up here, and its harbour is capable of hold|ing 50 or 60 &s;ail of the line. It lyes three miles from Middleburg, to which there is a paved road lined with trees.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Middleburg frequently make ex|cur&s;ions to this place, to which there are &s;tage-coaches going and coming at certain hours of the day. The town is but a &s;mall one, merely &s;urrounding the har|bour, over which there is a bridge of boats, that ri&s;es and falls with the tide.</P>
<P>This was one of the cautionary towns which the States-general put into the hands of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for defraying the expences of this nation, in defending them again&s;t the king of Spain. It was afterwards re|&s;tored to them by king <HI>James,</HI> when under his difficul|ties, for a very &s;mall part of the &s;um which remained due by them to England. This is one of the three places which <HI>Charles</HI> V. advi&s;ed his &s;on <HI>Philip</HI> II. to
<PB N="8" REF="9">
pre&s;erve with great care. The Zealanders are in ge|neral very much attached to the <HI>Orange</HI> family.</P>
<P>The women in the I&s;land of Walcheren are clad for the mo&s;t part in red cloth, and wear &s;traw hats. When any one dies there, if it is a man, they lay a great bun|dle at his door; if a child, a little one; if a male, it is put on the right &s;ide; if it is a female, on the left. When a woman is brought to bed, they give notice of what &s;ex the child is to the neighbourhood, by tying a piece of lawn to the knocker of the door, made up in the &s;hape of a puppet, and repre&s;enting the &s;ex of the new-born child.</P>
<P>The province of Utrecht is almo&s;t entirely envi|roned by tho&s;e of Holland and Guelderland. It is e&s;teemed one of the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t healthful of the United Netherlands; for here we may be &s;aid to tread on firm ground, whereas the maritime provinces are nothing but bogs, rendered habitable by incredible labour and indu&s;try. It is about five and twenty miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth.</P>
<P>Utrecht, the capital of this province, &s;tands in a de|lightful fine corn country, on the river Rhine, which here divides into two branches; it lyes about twenty-five miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Am&s;terdam, and as far north-ea&s;t from Rotterdam. The origin of this city has never been traced out, nor the preci&s;e epoch of its
<PB N="9" REF="10">
being built; it is known, however, to have taken its ri&s;e from one of tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es which the Romans built, when they conquered this country, as winter-quarters for their legions; but whether by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> or by <HI>Dru&s;us,</HI> is uncertain. It is rather conjec|tured to have been begun by <HI>Dru&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e the ca&s;tle of Utrecht went formerly by the name of <HI>Antonia,</HI> who was the wife of <HI>Dru&s;us.</HI> This is one of the fir&s;t cities in the United Provinces; and as it &s;tands in an healthful air, is much re&s;orted to by per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction, who have fine hou&s;es here: it is &s;pacious and very populous. The chief &s;treets, which are regular and well built, are cut through with two canals, called the New Gracht and the Vaert, which run through the whole city, having no fewer than thirty-five bridges over them. Utrecht is larger than the Hague, and next to it is the principal re&s;idence of the nobility and people of fa&s;hion who live on their fortunes.</P>
<P>The cathedral is in ruins, nor are there any public buildings that de&s;erve notice. The &s;teeple however of this church is one of the highe&s;t in Holland, and from the top of it may be &s;een an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over five of the &s;even provinces, and a great way further towards Cleve in Germany. In a clear day more than fifty walled towns may be &s;een, not above a day's journey from this city. Among other pious curio&s;i|ties, they &s;hew in one of the churches a &s;hift without any &s;eam, &s;aid to have been worn by the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">One of the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ights here, is what they call their Mall, &s;imilar to the Mall in St. James's Park, as it formerly &s;tood, about half as long, and half its breath, and con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome parrallel walks, regularly planted with lime trees: but that in the middle is properly the mall, with a ring at the end, and enclo&s;ed with wooden kirbs to keep in the ball, it being the ground for a Dutch game. Here the be&s;t company in Utrecht parade backward and forwards, e&s;pecially on Sunday evenings in the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Utrecht being on the &s;ide of two hills, with a valley between, one canal runs we&s;t into the city in this val|ley, and low hou&s;es are built on each bank, &s;o as that their tops are on a level with the &s;treets on both &s;ides above; and there is an arched way under one of the &s;treets, by which carts pa&s;s to this canal, as if going into a vault. The &s;ides of the canal above the hou&s;es on its banks, are defended by a parapet wall.</P>
<P>The environs of this city are very plea&s;ant, being full of gardens, orchards, canals, and walks; but the &s;oil is too &s;andy for the rich verdure of meadows, and therefore there are arable lands very near the city.</P>
<P>The fortifications are not &s;trong, by which means, in 1672, the French took it without firing a gun. They kept it in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion near a couple of years, and were preparing to build a citadel here,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
when the Germans coming to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dutch, they were obliged to retire; but not without having fir&s;t levied a heavy contribution on the in|habitants, to the amount of 200,000 pounds. In this city the peace in 1713 was concluded between France, England, Portugal, Pru&s;&s;ia, Savoy, and Hol|land; and here the union of the &s;even provinces was begun in 1579.</P>
<P>Their univer&s;ity, which was at fir&s;t only a public &s;chool, and founded in 1636, is now in a very flouri&s;h|ing &s;ituation. It is very much frequented by Ger|mans, and by &s;ome Engli&s;h, who come here for the &s;ake of education and degrees, which are to be obtain|ed here &s;ooner than in England. The &s;tudents wear their ordinary dre&s;s, and board in the town; there being &s;carce any endowed colleges in Holland, where they live together in &s;ocieties as they do in our Eng|li&s;h univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Utrecht is the village of Zey&s;t, which &s;trangers generally vi&s;it on account of the neatne&s;s of the place, and the great harmony in which the inhabitants live together, who are a &s;ociety of people termed Moravians, that form a &s;eparate community from the re&s;t of their neighbours. This &s;ect, which made a great noi&s;e in Europe &s;ome years ago, had its origin in Moravia, as far back as the fifteenth century, under the title of <HI>Unitas Fratrum,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="13">
or the United Brethren. In the &s;ixteenth century they had upwards of 200 places of wor&s;hip; but not being permitted to exerci&s;e the function of their reli|gion openly in Moravia and Bohemia, where were their principal e&s;tabli&s;hments, they took refuge in the territories of the Count <HI>de Zinzendorf,</HI> who openly e&s;pou&s;ed their cau&s;e, and their &s;ect has now expanded it&s;elf in all parts of Europe, and even in Africa and America.</P>
<P>The brethren have adopted the Aug&s;burg con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith in their &s;ynods. Any mini&s;ter, whether he be a Lutheran, a Calvini&s;t, or a Moravian, may ad|mini&s;ter the &s;acrament among them, without &s;epara|ting him&s;elf from the particular &s;ect to which he be|longs.</P>
<P>Their &s;ervice does not la&s;t above three quarters of an hour. They &s;ing Lutheran hymns, read one or more chapters of the Bible, and preach. Their church mu&s;ic is the organ, the violin, and the French horn. When the clergymen admini&s;ter the &s;acra|ment, they are dre&s;&s;ed in long white garments, tied round with red ribbon, and a violet coloured cap on their head. They keep tho&s;e fe&s;tivals ob&s;erved in the prote&s;tant church, be&s;ides &s;ome few of their own.</P>
<P>They bury their dead in tombs made on pur|po&s;e, and on Ea&s;ter Sunday at &s;un-ri&s;e, they go in
<PB N="13" REF="14">
proce&s;&s;ion to their burying grounds, which are not, as in other places, di&s;tingui&s;hed to the &s;ight, but places of repo&s;e ornamented and cultivated like plea&s;ant gardens.</P>
<P>What they call their communities, are hand&s;ome buildings, inhabited only by them&s;elves. One of them <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. re&s;ided in during his &s;tay in the province of Utrecht. They are divided into diffe|rent cla&s;&s;es, which they call choirs. Their cla&s;&s;es are, the unmarried men, the unmarried women, the married per&s;ons, the widowers, and the widows.&mdash; The&s;e latter are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a white ribbon; the unmarried women wear a pale red, and the girls a deep coloured red; the married women a blue. Each cla&s;s has its habitation apart, under in&s;pectors of their own &s;ex, except the married people, who live by them&s;elves. The &s;uperiors of the&s;e commu|nities can inflict no puni&s;hment be&s;ides excomunica|tion and expul&s;ion from the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The finances of the &s;ociety con&s;i&s;t in a volunta|ry contribution every three months. Every mem|ber contributes only what he thinks proper, without any que&s;tion being a&s;ked him; yet this confidence is not abu&s;ed, for the fund of the &s;ociety is very great. And here let it be ob&s;erved, that the term <HI>Brethren</HI> is not a mere name; they perform very &s;cru|pulou&s;ly all the duties of brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">This &s;ect is compo&s;ed chiefly of arti&s;ts; yet tho&s;e who are in a much more elevated &s;tation, frequently become members of it; but every thing is &s;o well regulated, that the rich are not to in&s;ult over the poor. Equality is the grand principle which regulates all their actions. The &s;tronge&s;t arm a&s;&s;i&s;ts the weake&s;t. The mo&s;t indu&s;trious admini&s;ters with his talents to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e towards whom Heaven has been le&s;s bountiful. Violence and oppre&s;&s;ion do not &s;natch away the &s;ub&s;tance of the unfortunate, the widows, and the orphans.</P>
<P>A brother of the unity can only marry a &s;i&s;ter of the unity, el&s;e he renounces the &s;ociety. He has not even the liberty to marry whom he plea&s;es of the &s;ociety. He mu&s;t take the wife they give him. An American woman &s;ometimes marries a German, and both are ordered off for A&s;ia, or &s;ome other place. In other re&s;pects, they conform in their mar|riages to the cu&s;toms of the country where they live. It is con&s;idered as a kind of di&s;grace to live &s;ingle.</P>
<P>Amersfort, the &s;econd town of the province, fifteen miles north-ea&s;t of Utrecht, &s;tands in a fruitful coun|try abounding in corn and pa&s;ture-ground. At this port are &s;hipped all the goods brought out of Ger|many by the He&s;&s;ian waggons, which are con&s;ign|ed to Am&s;terdam. But what is mo&s;t remarkable
<PB N="15" REF="16">
in this neighbourhood, there is a hunting &s;eat of the late king <HI>William,</HI> abounding in game, which &s;tands in a fore&s;t, near ten miles in length and five in breadth.</P>
<P>Frie&s;land is &s;o called from the Fri&s;ons, an ancient martial people who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the territory of the United Provinces, and even &s;ome parts of Germany. It is bounded by the German ocean on the north; by Groningen on the ea&s;t; Overy&s;&s;el on the &s;outh; and the Zuyder-&s;ea on the we&s;t. Its ex|tent is about forty miles from north to &s;outh, and twen|ty-five from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>Frie&s;land, in its air and &s;oil, very much re&s;embles Holland, e&s;pecially in the north-we&s;t part, which is lower than the &s;ea, and is particularly remarkable for its fine pa&s;tures; in which, be&s;ides excellent oxen, cows and &s;heep, are numerous breeds of large hor&s;es, which are in very great e&s;teem, and are exported to Germany, and other countries. In the more elevated parts, are good corn lands, and the wheat produced in them is very much admired for the finene&s;s of the ears, and its white flour. The Frie&s;land peas have likewi&s;e an agreeable ta&s;te, &s;uperior to mo&s;t others.</P>
<P>Their be&s;t and almo&s;t their only firing is turf, which burns as white, and gives as good a heat as wood: the&s;e turf meadows, it is &s;aid, being mixed with a bitu|minous
<PB N="16" REF="17">
matter, have taken fire at different times, and burnt up the country for &s;everal leagues.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, for want of &s;and-hills along the &s;ea coa&s;t, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring them|&s;elves again&s;t the &s;ea by dykes. When the&s;e dykes were repaired at the expence of the proprietors of e&s;tates bordering upon them, they were built very low, and frequently &s;uffered to go &s;o much to decay, as to be unable to with&s;tand the impetuo&s;ity of the waves driven again&s;t them by a north-we&s;t wind; and from the breaches that have been made, the whole country has been frequently laid under water, and great numbers of per&s;ons peri&s;hed, not to mention the lo&s;s of their cattle. In order to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, when under the&s;e cala|mities, the inhabitants rai&s;ed &s;everal eminences from twenty to twenty-five feet high, and of con&s;iderable circumference, to which, unle&s;s they were intercepted by the rapidity of the inundations, they betook them|&s;elves with their cattle and hou&s;ehold furniture, and remained there till the flood had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>The&s;e eminences at fir&s;t were called Waerd, or Werd, afterwards Terp. In proce&s;s of time, hou&s;es, or rather whole villages and towns, were built on the&s;e mounts, and hence it is, that the names of many places in Frie&s;land end in Werd and Terp. The&s;e dykes however, are now con&s;tructed at the public expence,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
and being con&s;equently made higher and wider, the eruptions of the &s;ea are le&s;s frequent.</P>
<P>In the number of the canals with which it is inter|&s;ected, Frei&s;land may vie with Holland. The&s;e ca|nals, as in Holland, &s;erve not only for carrying the &s;uperfluous waters into the &s;ea, but for the facility of commerce.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;till retain that &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for liberty which di&s;tingui&s;hed their ance&s;tors, together with their old cu&s;toms and manners of living, even to the ancient Fri&s;on dialect and accent; which make their language as unintelligible to the re&s;t of the Dutch, as the Welch language is in England.</P>
<P>The people of this province are, for the mo&s;t part, martially inclined, and chu&s;e to follow the camp rather than apply them&s;elves to trade. Their nobility and gentry, in particular, are very aver&s;e to marry into the families of merchants or mechanics, and delight in dre&s;s and magnificent equipage more than their &s;outhern neighbours. In their fa&s;hions the better cla&s;s of peo|ple follow the French; but in their ho&s;pitality and convivial mode of living, the Germans. The lower cla&s;s dre&s;s as do the pea&s;ants in Guelderland.</P>
<P>Frie&s;land, however, is not without &s;ome manufactures, and is more particularly famous for its linen ones,

<P>Though the majority of the inhabitants are Calvi|ni&s;ts, yet there are a great many Catholics, and &s;till more of the Mennonites in this province: this is the le&s;s to be wondered at, as <HI>Menno Simon,</HI> from whom they derive their name, fir&s;t propagated his doctrines in this province.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Provinces of Overy&s;&s;el, Groningen, Guelder|land, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE province of Overy&s;&s;el is bounded by Gro|ningen on the north, by Mun&s;ter on the ea&s;t, by Guelderland on the &s;outh, and by the Zuyder-&s;ea on the we&s;t; it extends near &s;ixty miles in length, and forty in breadth. Till the year 1540, it made part of the province of Utrecht, and in ancient times it com|po&s;ed part of Frie&s;land. This country is by no means peopled in proportion to its extent. The &s;oil is for the mo&s;t part mar&s;hy, and yields nothing but turf, but along the Y&s;&s;el there is &s;ome very good corn land, and &s;ome pa&s;ture ground, but it falls far &s;hort of the rich|ne&s;s of the pa&s;tures in the other provinces; and in&s;tead of being the property of particular per&s;ons, belongs in common to the inhabitants of the neare&s;t villages; it is
<PB N="20" REF="21">
al&s;o a fine &s;porting country. The climate re&s;embles that of We&s;tphalia very much, on which it borders; and like that part of Germany, it has very exten&s;ive commons, which produce little or nothing.</P>
<P>The nobility of this province are more numerous than any other; and a nobleman, in order to be admit|ted into the a&s;&s;embly of his cla&s;s, mu&s;t not only prove his de&s;cent, and that he is of the Calvini&s;t religion, but likewi&s;e &s;hew that he is twenty-four years of age, and that he has an e&s;tate in the province &s;ufficient to qualify him to be &s;ummoned to the a&s;&s;embly, that is to &s;ay, of 25,000 guilders. Any nobleman likewi&s;e, who is in the army, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e qualifications, is capable of being a member of the regency, provided he be not below the rank of captain; but when mili|tary affairs come into con&s;ideration, he mu&s;t quit the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The principal towns in this province are Deventer, Campen, and Zwoll.</P>
<P>The country about Deventer is rich and well culti|vated, but there are &s;ome mar&s;h lands and &s;andytracks in it. The city carries a tolerable appearance of trade though nothing in compari&s;on of what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when it was a Han&s;e Town. There are many peo|ple of fortune here, who make it their re&s;idence, which renders the town chearful, and the more agreeable to
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;trangers; but the public buildings have nothing in them de&s;erving notice; though &s;trangers are &s;hewn an uncommon old tower of great antiquity, called the Tower of Nuremberg, built with brick and &s;tone, the walls of which are near twenty feet thick; a remark|able fortification before the invention of that de&s;truc|tive compound with &s;alt-petre. In this city is brewed an excellent beer, of which great quantities are export|ed; and the Deventer cakes are celebrated all over the&s;e provinces.</P>
<P>Zwoll was anciently a Han&s;e Town: this was the birth-place of the celebrated <HI>Thomas &agrave; Kempis.</HI> It is a very con&s;iderable city, and lies between two rivers, a branch of one of which runs through the town. The &s;treets are regular, and well built, and there are &s;eve|ral public edifices that will catch the attention of a &s;tranger; the fortifications are its greate&s;t ornament, from being planted all round with trees; it is al&s;o a very &s;trong place, being &s;urrounded both with a wall and ramparts, &s;trengthened by large and good ba&s;tions, and &s;everal outworks; exclu&s;ive of three forts near the Y&s;&s;el to the &s;outh-we&s;t, which communicate with each other, and with the town by &s;trong lines. The view of erecting the&s;e forts in ca&s;e of a &s;iege, was to &s;ecure to the town the means of receiving reinforce|ments from Gelderland. Without the Kampen, Saen, and Die&s;er gates, are very hand&s;ome &s;uburbs.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">Campen has nothing to recommend it but a wooden bridge over the Y&s;&s;el, of a very curious &s;tructure, being 723 feet in breadth, and 20 broad, and built on piles, which are at &s;o great a di&s;tance from each other, that the bridge &s;eems &s;u&s;pended in the air. Though, ac|cording to the modern &s;y&s;tem of fortification, this town may not be ranked among the fortre&s;&s;es, yet on an emergency, they can lay all the country round under water.</P>

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of GRONINGEN</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded on the north by the German ocean, on the ea&s;t by Emden, and on the &s;outh by Overy&s;&s;el. It extends thirty miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about twenty from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P>In air and &s;oil it bears a very near affinity with Frie&s;land. The land for the mo&s;t part lyes low, and abounds in fine pa&s;tures, though there is &s;ome arable land which, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> &s;eemed well managed; for the crops were clean, and the fallows well tilled. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the province, towards Drenthe, the ground is heathy, &s;andy, and inter&s;per&s;ed with fore&s;ts. The whole country is exceedingly well peopled. The peo|ple &s;eem remarkably chearful and happy. This hap|pine&s;s and content among the lower cla&s;&s;es makes travelling very agreeable; for nothing is &s;o mi&s;e|rably irk&s;ome as moving through a country who&s;e inhabitants are oppre&s;&s;ed with poverty and rags.&mdash;
<PB N="23" REF="24">
The&s;e great di&s;tinctions are owing to variations of government: arbitrary power &s;preads nothing but po|verty and mi&s;ery, while a free government makes all the people happy who live under it. All the parts of Holland are much more heavily taxed than any coun|try in Europe where arbitrary power reigns; that is, a given number of people pay more to the &s;tate, and yet the individuals are le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed and more wealthy.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olute power impoveri&s;hes &s;o heavily, that the people have nothing to pay; the money torn from them by irregularity and private oppre&s;&s;ion amounts to infinitely more than all the wealth which goes into the monarch's coffers. The king tyrannizes over the nobility; the nobility over the gentry; the gentry over the trade&s;men; and all of them combine to fleece and oppre&s;s the countrymen. In &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem from whence can property come? Nothing can exi&s;t with &s;ecurity but e&s;tates in land; for labour, indu&s;try, and ingenuity can only create an income &s;ufficient to pay heavy taxes. As wealth, therefore, is &s;o much the idol and pur&s;uit of all the monarchs in Europe, it is &s;trange that &s;ome &s;cheming head has not fallen upon the means of qualifying the effects of arbitrary power for an in|crea&s;e of their &s;ubjects wealth.</P>
<P>The great objects that a traveller, e&s;pecially one who propo&s;es to publi&s;h the re&s;ult of his travels, ought to attend to, are tho&s;e which have the greate&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="25">
probability of being u&s;eful to his country. It is on this principle we occa&s;ionally enter into their mode of agri|culture, as well as their police and other circum&s;tances, and it is for the &s;ame rea&s;on we &s;hall extract the fol|lowing conver&s;ation with a farmer on the ea&s;tern part of this province, from <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> on the manage|ment of his land.</P>
<P>This man's farm con&s;i&s;ted of 160 acres, in which were included pa&s;ture and arable land, as well as mar&s;h and a &s;andy wa&s;te, be&s;ides an exten&s;ive right of common, for which he paid after the rate of &s;ix florins an acre. In walking over a piece of poor &s;andy ground with him, I enquired whether he could not improve that &s;oil; he an&s;wered, it was already very valuable, for the fallow year yielded him, without any tillage, a great crop of fern. This appeared &s;trange; that plant being repre&s;ented in England as a pernicious weed; but he explained him&s;elf by &s;aying, that this fern &s;erved him in the mo&s;t ample manner for littering down his cattle in their winter &s;talls; by which means this piece of &s;andy land yielded a very large quantity of manure for his better lands, and at the &s;ame time furni&s;hed better litter for his cattle than &s;traw, which they wanted in feeding. Upon being told that our farmers kept their cattle in the field during the win|ter as well as the &s;ummer, he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;aid all the cattle in his country, both old and young, and of all &s;orts, were regularly kept in hou&s;e through
<PB N="25" REF="26">
the winter. Upon my ob&s;erving, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> that this mu&s;t prove an expen&s;ive management, he replied, No: but that if it was &s;o, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; fir&s;t for the good of the cattle, which he a&s;&s;erted would be &s;o pinched by the fro&s;t in winter, that twice the quantity of food would be in&s;ufficient to keep them in heart; and &s;uch bea&s;ts as were very tender, he thought, would not out-live the winter in the fields. But, &s;ays the old man, how is your dung rai&s;ed, if the cattle in England are kept all the winter in the fields? By keeping our cattle hou&s;ed, &s;ays he, we not only pre|&s;erve them in good health, but al&s;o rai&s;e a large quan|tity of manure, with which we improve tho&s;e fields that will probably pay the be&s;t for it. We very com|monly, &s;aid he, feed the cattle with hay, turneps, and winter cabbage, and litter them down at the &s;ame time with &s;traw; but tho&s;e among us who have fern on our lands, give the &s;traw to our cattle of inferior value, and litter all &s;orts with fern, which we find an improvement of the mo&s;t valuable kind; for it en|ables us to &s;ub&s;titute &s;traw as food; in&s;tead of hay, to great part of our &s;tock.</P>
<P>Another material point is the value of dung; we find from experience, that fern makes better manure than &s;traw, and that two loads of dung made with fern, are equal in value to three made with &s;traw. Fern manure will likewi&s;e la&s;t much longer in the &s;oil than &s;traw. This information, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> I con&s;idered
<PB N="26" REF="27">
as very valuable; for I remember, that in England a great deal of fern grows on very exten&s;ive com|mons, and that no u&s;e whatever is made of it; being left to rot in the commons and warrens, as if it was impo&s;&s;ible to turn it to any account.</P>
<P>This very intelligent farmer a&s;&s;ured me he was the more attentive to this application of his fern, becau&s;e he found the goodne&s;s of his crops depended entirely on the quantities of &s;uch manure; and that he &s;hould not be able to make any advantage of his farm, if he neglected rai&s;ing as much dung as po&s;&s;ible in winter. He not only made u&s;e of his fern for this purpo&s;e, but he likewi&s;e procured a va&s;t quantity of ru&s;hes nd flags to the amount of &s;everal waggon loads, from a mar&s;hy bit of land he had, which was &s;o much overflowed, that no cattle could get at it, ex|cept for about two months in the height of &s;ummer. The&s;e he applies to the &s;ame u&s;e as his fern, that is, for littering down his cattle, in which he finds an equal advantage. Another circum&s;tance he made me ac|quainted with, which it may not be ami&s;s to mention, was a method he had in the management of his dung; when he litters his cattle down with fern or ru&s;hes, he &s;trewed &s;and among it, in pretty large quantities. This, he &s;aid, would increa&s;e the quantity of manure, and al&s;o the quality of it, by ab&s;orbing all the urine, and that it was not of the lea&s;t prejudice to the cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">His management of &s;heep is exactly on the &s;ame plan; for, in&s;tead of folding them in the fields, as is the cu&s;tom in England, he all the winter folds them near his barn, and litters them down in the &s;ame manner as he does his cows. The old man ob&s;erving me very attentive to his conver&s;ation, ex|tended his walk to &s;hew me his crops, which &s;eemed to be very good; he had fields of mo&s;t &s;orts of com|mon grain, and one or two of buck wheat, which he &s;aid was very profitable. The only peculiar one, not known in the fields of England, was carrots; he had a long field of them, in which he had a great number of women and children weeding. This be &s;aid was the mo&s;t profitable crop on his farm.</P>
<P>Groningen, the capital of this province, is very hand&s;ome, and a remarkably regular built city; the &s;treets cro&s;s each other at right angles; having nume|rous hou&s;es, that make a very good appearance; and the public buildings add much to the beauty of the place. It is &s;urrounded with a fortification, which the inhabitants reckon very &s;trong, principally be|cau&s;e the out-works were planned by <HI>Cohorn.</HI> St. Martin's church is worth &s;eeing; they have a remark|able organ in it, which is &s;hewn to &s;trangers; and they conduct them to the top of the &s;teeple, from whence there is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over the adjacent country, and well worth viewing, from its being a country chiefly of rich land, inter&s;ected with canals. The great &s;quare is remarkably hand&s;ome, regularly
<PB N="28" REF="29">
laid out, and well-built. Here al&s;o, though Gronin|gen is an inland place, is a beautiful harbour for &s;hips, well fenced with quays, whereon is a good ap|pearance of bu&s;ine&s;s. The canal that brings up the&s;e &s;hips is a very noble one. There being other canals which branch every way from hence, the town car|ries on a good trade with all the neighbouring coun|tries, and pretty far into Germany. Upon the whole, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> I have not, &s;ince my arrival in Hol|land, &s;een a place that plea&s;ed me better.</P>

<HEAD>The PROVINCE of GUELDERLAND</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded by the Zuyder-&s;ea to the north, by Bra|bant on the &s;outh, by Mun&s;ter on the ea&s;t, and the Province of Holland on the we&s;t. Its extent is about fifty miles from north to &s;outh, and nearly as much from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This Province is u&s;ually &s;ub|divided into three le&s;&s;er di&s;tricts; the Veluve, the Betuwe, or ancient Batavia, and the county of Zutphen. The air of this province is for the mo&s;t part better than in any of the re&s;t; and the &s;oil in general good; though the middle part of the Veluve con&s;i&s;ts of &s;and|hills, heath and furze. The county of Zutphen is al&s;o heathy, but there is &s;uch a plenty of apples, pears, and cherries, as to &s;upply all the other provinces with their fruits. Though this province has precedence of all the others, becau&s;e it was decorated with the title of Duchy at the time of the Union, yet it is at pre&s;ent one of the lea&s;t important of any of them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">It bears great re&s;emblance to that part of Germany with which it lyes contiguous, except in the &s;tate of &s;lavery and mi&s;ery of the pea&s;ants. In no part of the United Netherlands do we &s;ee the pea&s;ants groaning under the weight of their burthens, and earning a mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with the &s;weat of their brows. The pea&s;ants in Holland are always at their ea&s;e, and oftentimes rich. They frequently do not deign to reap their own corn, but leave this ta&s;k to &s;ome inferior Germans, who come into the&s;e provinces ready to undertake any work.</P>
<P>The republican pea&s;ant is well cloathed, his dre&s;s or|namented with little gold or &s;ilver buttons to his coat and wai&s;tcoat, all the way down, placed clo&s;e to each other, like tho&s;e on the garment of a Romi&s;h prie&s;t, with immen&s;e &s;ilver buttons on the wai&s;tband of his trow&s;ers, enormous &s;ilver buckles to his &s;hoes, and a large &s;ilver watch to &s;hew the hour; he has al&s;o a gold button or cla&s;p at his neck before, and garter buckles of the &s;ame metal. Many of them drive about in their cabriolets, and the height of their plea&s;ure is to go full trot at the ri&s;k of the unfor|tunate foot pa&s;&s;engers who happen to be in their way, to whom they pay no regard.</P>
<P>The female pea&s;ants, who&s;e ta&s;te of dre&s;s is dif|ferent in different provinces, deck them&s;elves out with bits of gold in their hair, and a kind of gold temple &s;prings that pre&s;s the temples from behind,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
as our temple &s;pectacles do from before, and wear a gold or diamond cro&s;s hung round the neck, and pen|dant on their bo&s;om.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e ornaments their dre&s;s appears ridicu|lous, and without ta&s;te; for dre&s;s ever appears ridicu|lous when it is not &s;uitable to the &s;tation of the wearer. With all the&s;e appearances of &s;plendor their repa&s;ts are economical in the extreme. Some of their pea&s;ants even eat their meals without any drink, and wait till they have their tea, before they take any thing to quench their thir&s;t.</P>
<P>Nimeguen is a large and con&s;iderable city, &s;trongly fortified, being con&s;idered as one of the keys of the United Provinces, and is the capital of that of Guel|derland. It is built in the form of a cre&s;cent, on five &s;mall hills, by the river &s;ide, and is very popu|lous, having &s;everal manufactures that are flouri&s;h|ing. In St. Stephen's church is a very fine monument of <HI>Catharine</HI> of Bourbon, wife to <HI>Adolph</HI> VII. duke of Guelder. The Stadthou&s;e is a con&s;iderable edifice, but has nothing elegant in it. From the old ca&s;tle, there is a very beautiful pro&s;pect of the adjacent country.&mdash; Within this ca&s;tle are mo&s;t delightful walks planted with &s;everal rows of lime trees. This place is much noted for that famous treaty of peace negociated be|tween France and the Confederates in 1678 and 1679, called the treaty of Nimeguen, and of which Sir
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<HI>William Temple</HI> has left &s;o excellent an account. In 1702, Mar&s;hal <HI>Bouflers</HI> formed a de&s;ign of &s;eizing this place, as being at that time de&s;titute of a garri&s;on; but the Dutch general, the Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> made &s;uch expedition to its relief, that the Mar&s;hal's &s;cheme was fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>Arnheim is another fine city extremely well-built, with &s;everal beautiful &s;treets, and delightfully &s;itu|ated on the banks of the Rhine, about ten miles to the north of Nimeguen. It lyes at the foot of the Veluve hills, about two miles from the place where the Y&s;&s;el and the Rhine divide their &s;treams. Over the latter of the&s;e rivers, it has a bridge of boats leading to the Veluve, and before the Rhine gate is a commodious harbour of a quadrangular form. The fortifications on the land &s;ide were con&s;iderably enlarged in 1702, by that &s;kilful engineer General <HI>Cohorn,</HI> who al&s;o inclo&s;ed within a &s;trong line an emi|nence to the we&s;t of the town, which, in ca&s;e of a &s;iege, might have been a great annoyance to it, but is now capable of containing a &s;mall camp for its de|fence. The walls are delightfully planted with lime trees, and may be walked round with ea&s;e in an hour and an half.</P>
<P>It is made the winter re&s;idence of many per&s;ons of fortune and di&s;tinction, who &s;pend the &s;ummer on their e&s;tates in the Veluve. The place is lively,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
having a greater air of chearfulne&s;s and ea&s;e than mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are to be met with in Holland. I here was treated well, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> and &s;erved with a table that almo&s;t de&s;erved the epithet of elegant, and yet the expence was not extravagant.</P>
<P>From this place, &s;ays he, I made an excur&s;ion to &s;ee Loo, the famous favourite &s;eat of King <HI>William.</HI> The whole is a vile country, all heaths and fore&s;ts, and in the mid&s;t of which &s;tands the palace; it contains nothing to attract the admiration of an Engli&s;hman, who has &s;een the fine buildings of his own country. The gardens are what the Dutch mo&s;t admire; but the&s;e are quite in the old &s;tyle, with water-works, ba&s;ons, and regular ca&s;cades; but they &s;hew you the &s;hady walks with a kind of exultation, as if none &s;uch were to be met with anywhere el&s;e. They are indeed very well planted, and the trees are very large, but all is clipt and regular. This was the &s;eat where King <HI>William</HI> u&s;ed always to retire, when the affairs of &s;tate would permit him; the whole country round abounding in game. We&s;t of Loo lyes Adel Lake, noted for its inexhau&s;tible breed of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Zutphen is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of drained fens, but is yet reckoned by the inhabitants to have a very whole&s;ome air; it is a large well-built town, and &s;trong|ly fortified; the public buildings are hand&s;ome and de|&s;erve notice, particularly a bridge over the Berkel.
<PB N="33" REF="34">
The old church is a fine building, and the &s;teeple very high; all the towns in Holland have their Stadthou&s;es, as well as Am&s;terdam; but many of them are very mean edifices, like our town halls in Engli&s;h corpora|tion towns, which are generally heaps of rubbi&s;h. This of Zutphen, however, de&s;erves notice. The ruins of a palace are &s;till to be &s;een here, which, according to the tradition of the place, belonged to the ancient Counts of Zutphen; and near it there is a high brick tower of a pyramidal form, one of the greate&s;t orna|ments to the city. The mona&s;teries which were for|merly here, are part of them demoli&s;hed, and the re&s;t converted into ho&s;pitals or other &s;ecular u&s;es. There are &s;everal plea&s;ant walks, particularly on the ram|parts, which, like all the others in this country, are planted with trees. The &s;uburbs for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;t of little plea&s;ure-hou&s;es with &s;mall gardens, elegantly laid out in the Dutch ta&s;te. It was formrely a Han&s;e-town. Like mo&s;t of the towns in this province, it was taken by the French in 1672. Mo&s;t of the coun|try of Zutphen, and a great part of Guelderland, con|&s;i&s;t either of mar&s;hes, heaths, or but half improved lands: indeed the people are very unequally di&s;tri|buted; the province of Holland is full of cities and towns, and every inch cultivated; but the&s;e parts being much more out of the way of trade, are not &s;o thronged with people.</P>

This fortre&s;s is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, in the middle of an exten&s;ive mar&s;h, through which there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of approaching the place, if there were not cau&s;eways made through the mar&s;h, and the&s;e are &s;trongly fortified by redoubts. The town is five miles in circumference, and &s;eated on the confluence of the three rivers, Domel, Aa, and Dre&s;e; from this place pa&s;&s;age-boats go regular|ly to Rotterdam, as our boats go from London to Grave&s;end; the ditches round this place are filled by the waters of the rivers, which contribute much to its &s;trength; and forms &s;everal very fine canals, which run through the heart of the city; over the&s;e there are fifty &s;tone bridges. Ten good &s;treets center in the principal &s;quare, which has a fine effect; but this &s;quare being &s;urrounded by timber buildings, gives it a mean appearance.</P>
<P>As to public buildings, the church of St. <HI>John</HI> is a very noble one; but the clock, which is &s;hewn with much o&s;tentation, has nothing in it very &s;triking. The Stadthou&s;e is a hand&s;ome edifice, rai&s;ed on the plan of that of Am&s;terdam, but on a much &s;maller &s;cale. Here are &s;everal very flouri&s;hing manufactures, particularly in the linen and woollen way; and &s;ome of knives, and other hardware, and al&s;o of needles. The linen trade is not &s;o flouri&s;hing as formerly, but even this has no rea&s;on to complain. The country

for &s;ome miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of this town, has many exten&s;ive tracks of wa&s;te land, which would an&s;wer the expence of cultivation, but the inhabitants do not in general &s;eem attentive to this bu&s;ine&s;s, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;ucce&s;s that &s;ome individuals have met with, who have attempted it.</P>
<P>Breda de&s;erves the traveller's attention; it is large, populous, and well built; and one of the &s;tronge&s;t towns in Holland; the fortifications are very regular, and kept in excellent repair; the &s;ituation of the place is low; for the &s;ea can be let into the ditches, and from thence over mo&s;t of the country, which mu&s;t render an army's acce&s;s to it very difficult. The whole barony and town comprehending 17 villages, belong to the Prince of Orange, who is the &s;overeign, and has a ca&s;tle, which was rebuilt here by the late king <HI>William;</HI> the river Mer&s;k running round like a moat; and a &s;mall park with &s;ome fine gardens.</P>
<P>The great church is a magnificent &s;tructure, and adorned with &s;everal beautiful monuments, two of which are of black and white marble, and of &s;uch cu|rious workman&s;hip, that &s;culptors have come from Rome, on purpo&s;e to view them. That of <HI>Angle|bert</HI> II. count of Na&s;&s;au, who died in 1504, is reckon|ed inimitable, being a perfect copy of nature, and adorned with &s;tatues and in&s;criptions, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. The &s;pire of this church is very hand&s;ome,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
and 362 feet high; but &s;carce any of the other public buildings are worth notice.</P>
<P>The environs of this city are very plea&s;ant. At the di&s;tance of about a couple of miles from this town, at different angles, are three delightful woods, which are cut through in all parts into walks and vi&s;tas, particu|larly the Lie&s;bo&s;ch, which is the fine&s;t of the three.</P>
<P>In 1667, the treaty, &s;o often mentioned in hi&s;tory, be|tween England, France and Holland was concluded in this place, under the mediation of the King of Sweden. This place is likewi&s;e famous for the treaty nego|tiated here, to re&s;tore <HI>Charles</HI> II. to his throne, and for the manife&s;to that was i&s;&s;ued hence to his &s;ubjects in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Bergen-op-zoom has long been celebrated as a &s;trong fortre&s;s; its wall, which is about four miles in circumference, is defended by five ba&s;tions and ten horn works. The adjacent country can al&s;o be laid under water; and as long as Zealand continues clear of enemies, any &s;upplies or reinforcements may be thrown into it, by means of the Scheld. The city is large, and the &s;treets regular; the church and the palace were fine buildings before the &s;iege, in 1747. The large &s;quare is very hand&s;ome, but the fortifica|tions are the principal objects in it. The Dukes of <HI>Parma</HI> and <HI>Spinola</HI> found this place too &s;trong, not|with&s;tanding

the great force they brought again&s;t it, which occa&s;ioned the title of the Virgin Fortre&s;s to be given to it, as being impregnable; for &s;uch it was con|&s;idered, till Mar&s;hal <HI>Lovendahl</HI> came before it, who took it in 1747, after a two months &s;iege, by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;tands in the mid&s;t of mar&s;hes; &s;o that every ad|vantage of &s;ituation is united with tho&s;e of <HI>Cohorn,</HI> who was long employed to con&s;truct whatever works he thought nece&s;&s;ary, to make it as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ible. A canal keeps open the communication with the &s;ea; and to defend this canal, there are redoubts, forts, pa|li&s;adoes, &amp;c. without number, and a village &s;trongly fortified in the mid&s;t. In &s;hort, no expence has been &s;pared to render it impregnable; and it is the ge|neral opinion in Holland, that it really is &s;o; and that the French would never have taken it with their cannon, had they not loaded them with golden balls.</P>
<P>There is a curious tower in this city, which gradu|ally grows wider towards the top. The lea&s;t breath of wind will put it in motion, &s;o that it appears to be tumbling down; it formerly terminated by an arrow built in the &s;ame direction; but this the Count de <HI>Auvergne</HI> pulled down, at the reque&s;t of the inhabi|tants. They would gladly have &s;een the whole tower demoli&s;hed, which he would not con&s;ent to, but made a platform on the top, which he &s;urrounded with a

balu&s;trade. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on in this place in anchovies, which are got out of the Scheld.</P>
<P>The States-General keep a large garri&s;on in this city, and the governor is always a per&s;on of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed reputation.</P>
<P>Mae&s;tricht is one of the mo&s;t ancient and remark|able cities in the Netherlands; it lyes on the Mae&s;e, by which it is divided into two parts, joined to each other by a grand &s;tone bridge. <HI>Pollnitz</HI> re|lates, that a young French nobleman of high rank, once leaped over this bridge, on hor&s;eback, into the Mae&s;e, as a proof of his love for his mi&s;tre&s;s. He was, it &s;eems, urging the warmth of his pa&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t one day riding by the &s;ide of her carriage; when &s;he told him there was not a word of truth in what he &s;aid, and that &s;he would venture a wager he did not love her enough to leap his hor&s;e into the river; he accepted the wager, and won it, at the ri&s;k of his life; for he was &s;o fortunate to keep his feet firm in the &s;tir|rups, and his hor&s;e carried him &s;afe to &s;hore. But after he had taken this dangerous leap, reflecting on her capricious humour, he broke off his court&s;hip, which was the lea&s;t &s;he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The circumference of Mae&s;tricht is about four miles; and the fortifications, which are in the modern way, may be reckoned among the be&s;t in Europe.
<PB N="40" REF="41">
The great market place and other &s;quares, are very beautiful; the &s;treets broad, and the buildings in ge|neral make a hand&s;ome appearance.</P>
<P>The town-hou&s;e is a magnificent &s;tructure, all of free &s;tone, and has one of the fine&s;t towers or &s;teeples in the low countries. It has al&s;o a good library, both of printed books and manu&s;cripts, and other curio&s;i|ties, worth a traveller's attention: as for the neigh|bouring country, it abounds with game; and there is &s;carce a town in Europe where provi&s;ions in general, and all the conveniencies of life, may be had cheaper than at Mae&s;tricht; it is a plea&s;ant voyage down the river here from Liege. Mae&s;tricht is not only one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es belonging to the republic, but likewi&s;e one of the principal keys on the Mae&s;e. Some defects having been ob&s;erved in the outworks, <HI>William</HI> IV. about four weeks before his death, took a &s;urvey of them, and a plan was formed for their re|moval. Its cloth manufactory, which was formerly &s;o con&s;iderable, is now gone to decay.</P>
<P>The &s;overeignty of the town belongs jointly to the States-general, and the Bi&s;hop of Liege; but the for|mer alone garri&s;on it, and are likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ole power over the convents and eccle&s;ia&s;tics in general; by virtue of which, they grant privileges and immunities of all kinds. In other re&s;pects the town is under the joint government of the States and the
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Bi&s;hop; and the town&s;men are divided into two de|partments, each electing half the magi&s;tracy, which con&s;i&s;ts of an equal number of Calvini&s;ts, Brabanters, and Papi&s;ts; the latter are natives of the Bi&s;hopric of Liege.</P>
<P>About two mu&s;ket &s;hots from this place, &s;tands the St. Peter&s;burg, being much higher than the town; and having been very detrimental to it in a former &s;iege, in 1701, the States-general cau&s;ed a very &s;trong fort to be built on it, under the name of St. Pe|ter's fort: this fort lying within the territory of Liege, the Bi&s;hop complained loudly of their procedure; but in 1717, the affair was accommodated. On the hill is an excellent horizontal quarry, with an entrance to it clo&s;e by the Mae&s;e, &s;o that carts go in and unload at the banks of the river. Within this quarry are long horizontal pa&s;&s;ages, &s;upported by innumerable &s;quare pillars, which are every where twenty feet high, and in many places more: it has &s;everal vent-holes, cut in it, as al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall re&s;ervoirs of water, and in war time, it is a &s;afe retreat for the country people, who being acquainted with all its meandrings, &s;ecure their cattle and valuable effects in this &s;ubterranean repo&s;i|tory, which affords convenient room for 40,000 men. <HI>Ellis,</HI> who went into the quarry, &s;ays it is more won|derful than has been de&s;cribed; it is three leagues or nine miles in length, and one league or three miles broad; and capable of &s;heltering 100,000 men; that its exce&s;&s;ive coldne&s;s co&s;t him a fit of the ague, and
<PB N="42" REF="43">
that the &s;tone dug from it, is like our kettling &s;tone. A &s;tranger who &s;hould vi&s;it it without an experienced guide, would be in danger not only of bewildering him&s;elf, or of &s;tumbling again&s;t the corners of the pil|lars, but likewi&s;e of being &s;uddenly &s;hot by villains lurking in it. The upper part of the hill is good corn land, and on the &s;ide towards the Mae&s;e &s;tands the mona&s;tery of Slavante.</P>
<P>This city revolted from Spain about the year 1570, and was be&s;ieged by the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> in 1579' when after a very brave defence, it was &s;ur|prized in the night, and the inhabitants were treated with great &s;everity. It was taken by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in 1632, after an ob&s;tinate &s;iege of above two months, and from that time it continued in the hands of the Dutch, till 1673; when it was taken by the French king in per&s;on, after thirteen days open trenches.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht in 1676, by <HI>William</HI> prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterwards King of England, is very me|morable. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of 8,000 men, and the be&s;iegers were 30,000, who carried on their attacks with &s;uch intrepidity for three weeks, that it was ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed the place would at la&s;t be taken. During this &s;iege, the Engli&s;h gave &s;ignal proofs of their valour; but Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> advancing to the relief of the city with a &s;uperior force, and the rein|forcements
<PB N="43" REF="44">
which had been promi&s;ed him from Ger|many not arriving, the prince was obliged to ri&s;e from before the place, after fifty-two days open trenches, and the lo&s;s of 8,000 men. This city however did not continue long in the hands of the French, being re&s;tored to the &s;tates of Holland by the treaty of Ni|meguen, in 1678; in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it has ever &s;ince remained.</P>
<P>Sluys, termed in Flanders <HI>l' Eclu&s;e,</HI> is the large&s;t town in all that part of the country, belonging to the States general; it is of con&s;iderable circumference, but the greate&s;t part is taken up with gardens and bleach|ing grounds; it is a place of great con&s;equence, being &s;trongly fortified, and the mo&s;t commodious part in Flanders: exclu&s;ive of its &s;trong fortifications, the country round it to the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t, may be laid under water; but the north &s;ide being higher, it has a double wall on that part; being fenced by the Zwin a mora&s;s, which every flood is under water. Zwin is the name of the bay on which this city &s;tands; at its mouth, it is called the hor&s;e-market, from the &s;up|po&s;ed re&s;emblance its roaring bears in &s;tormy weather, to the noi&s;e of a market filled with tho&s;e animals. All the efforts of an enemy cannot hinder its communica|tion with the &s;ea, by which it can receive all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies and reinforcements; its air however is &s;o un|healthy, an inconvenience common to it, with all the
<PB N="44" REF="45">
towns in this part of Flanders, that the garri&s;on is changed every year.</P>
<P>There is an old canal between Sluys and Bruges; but &s;ince the Dutch have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sluys, and con&s;equently able whenever they plea&s;e to ob&s;truct the communication of Bruges with the &s;ea, a navigable canal has been cut between that city and O&s;tend.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of their <HI>MANNERS</HI> and <HI>CUSTOMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE climate in all countries has &s;uch an effect upon the inhabitants, that &s;ome &s;triking and di&s;tingui&s;hing marks will be found in their characters in all ages. <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who was &s;o accurate an ob&s;er|ver of men and manners, has given many &s;triking touches of character in his accounts of the ancient Germans, Gauls and Belgi, that are almo&s;t as appli|cable to the pre&s;ent French, Germans and Dutch, as they were to tho&s;e ancient nations; although the in|va&s;ions of the northern kingdoms, on the de&s;truction of the Roman Empire, made &s;uch a total change in all the provinces of the empire, in arts, manners, languages, opinions, and other circum&s;tances. In a word, a new people appeared in Italy, France, Eng|land, Germany and Holland; nothing therefore can
<PB N="45" REF="46">
be a greater proof of the influence of climate on the inhabitants of a country, than to find the pre&s;ent people of tho&s;e countries bear, in many particulars, a &s;triking re&s;emblance to the ancient inhabitants.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;trong national characters, which form the great di&s;tinction between different nations, are not the objects to expatiate on; &s;ince their being &s;o &s;trong, is alone a &s;ufficient proof that the authors of preceding ages have given us as ju&s;t accounts as any in the pre&s;ent can do. Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> has given us as judicious and &s;atisfactory an account of the Dutch in the la&s;t ages, as can be met with in any nation. Indeed, that writer was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a truer philo&s;ophic &s;pirit, than mo&s;t of the authors of his age and country. All his works are equal proofs of penetration, integrity and reflexion.</P>
<P>If we form an idea of the Dutch in the la&s;t age from his writings, and tho&s;e of &s;ome other authors of credit, we &s;hall find a people emerging from a mo&s;t con&s;ummate national frugality, and beginning to enjoy the wealth they had been heaping together for two centuries; but in that gradual change even lux|ury was par&s;imonious; it made none of tho&s;e gigantic &s;trides with which it overwhelms monarchies; its ap|proaches were proportioned to the equality of a re|publican government.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">In the pre&s;ent age, the Dutch are very much chang|ed; luxury has made as great a progre&s;s as it can make in any country that is not under a monar|chical government, and in which the landed e&s;tates are not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Holland is one of tho&s;e countries which contains no per&s;ons of large landed property. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the people are engaged in &s;ome trade or lucrative profe&s;&s;ion; they hardly know what a landed intere&s;t means; &s;o that the number of idle per&s;ons who are rich, con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of peo|ple in office, the military and foreigners. Hence ari&s;es that moderate degree of luxury found in the principal cities, particularly the Hague, which is the great place of di&s;&s;ipation. In London and Paris there is an immen&s;e expence lavi&s;hed upon every art and every means of enjoyment. In the&s;e cities may be &s;een co&s;tly operas, &s;plendid theatres, academies, exhibitions, and &s;uch a variety of diver&s;ions as would puzzle an inhabitant to name them all. Every day rears new temples of plea&s;ure, each more co&s;tly than the former; but at the Hague it is the very rever&s;e. They are expen&s;ive in concerts and private a&s;&s;em|blies; but even in the&s;e, the cities above mentioned far exceed them. There is more expence lavi&s;hed in concerts at London in one &s;pring, than at the Hague in a couple of years.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">In their edifices, the people of large fortune in Holland are expen&s;ive, but not magnificent; they build great hou&s;es with immen&s;e apartments; but com|pared with the rooms of our Engli&s;h palaces, they are but barns; and more deficient in the article of fitting up and fini&s;hing, than can well be conceived. In the palaces of London and tho&s;e which ornament our counties, there is to be found every exertion of ta&s;te and magnificence. In Holland, the furniture is what would be called hand&s;ome in England, but not to be named with that which ornaments the hou&s;es of our nobility, and rich gentry. Here however let it be ob&s;erved, that the national cleanline&s;s of the Dutch, though by no means carried to that exce&s;s which the common people delight in, renders their apartments much more plea&s;ing than tho&s;e in Italy and France, which are ornamented in the mo&s;t &s;uperb ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Thus we find in the above articles, there is no com|pari&s;on in point of expence, between Holland and the great kingdoms of Europe; it mu&s;t not however be taken for granted, that every thing is conducted in Holland in a mean &s;tyle, or in the manner of the la&s;t age: on the contrary, they are all in a much more ele|gant ta&s;te; great improvements have been made in all. A plainne&s;s and &s;implicity were found in all the&s;e, and a humility; but now a de&s;ire of making a figure is prevalent among them, which &s;hews they
<PB N="48" REF="49">
want nothing but the wealth, to equal the greate&s;t ex|ertions of our riche&s;t nobles.</P>
<P>The principal expence of the Dutch is their table; for in their entertainments, their tables are &s;pread in a mo&s;t elegant and plenteous manner, and their wines are much more numerous than is common in France or England, with per&s;ons of equal or even of &s;uperior fortune. Four cour&s;es, and a rich de&s;ert, are often &s;een at the tables of per&s;ons who&s;e income does not exceed 4,000l. a-year; and their cour&s;es are not like ours, of eight or ten di&s;hes only, but of twenty-five or thirty. Plate is more common at the Hague than might be imagined; for many of their rich nobility, and others retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, or from office, eat off very &s;u|perb &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The number of their dome&s;tics is not in general equal to tho&s;e of per&s;ons of the &s;ame fortune, in France or England. In the latter country, we have within the&s;e few years, di&s;continued the abominable cu&s;tom of &s;uffering them to receive vails; but in France, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> the cu&s;tom &s;till continues, and in Holland I have fee'd, &s;ays he, no le&s;s than &s;even attendants at a &s;ingle dinner.</P>
<P>They make great fea&s;ts in Holland on certain oc|ca&s;ions, &s;uch as weddings, the birth of a &s;on and heir, the arrival of a &s;on or friend from the Ea&s;t-Indies, &amp;c. in which they exhau&s;t every &s;pecies of luxury their
<PB N="49" REF="50">
fortunes will allow them to indulge in. I was pre&s;ent, &s;ays the above author, at one of the&s;e fea&s;ts at Am&s;ter|dam, where there were eight tables four times covered, and each cour&s;e above a hundred di&s;hes.</P>
<P>In England, people of large fortune divide their time between London and the country; their hou&s;e in London and their &s;eat in the country, form a per|fect contra&s;t; yet great expence is lavi&s;hed on them both. Great improvements are made in rural beau|ties; the whole neighbourhood is ornamented; pri|vate roads are con&s;tructed at great expence; but in Holland the country &s;eats are all &s;nug compact boxes, with &s;carce any appearance of territory about them, re&s;embling very much in that re&s;pect, the hou&s;es our London citizens have erected twenty miles round the capital. They are neat and &s;mall, with gardens of no extent, but with much clipt regularity; every thing is in the ta&s;te of England fifty years ago, but not quite &s;o expen&s;ive. Their gardens, too, have many fountains in them, which are as prepo&s;terous in their cold, damp country, as they are agreeable in the &s;ultry climes of Spain or Italy.</P>
<P>Relative to their youth, the Dutch have followed the French, though with &s;ome variations. Their edu|cation con&s;i&s;ts in their colleges, and &s;ub&s;equent tra|velling under a German tutor: on their return home, they either get &s;ome honourable and lucrative po&s;t,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
or enter into the army, or live at home upon their in|come; the&s;e are their young nobility, or per&s;ons of large independent fortune; but the inferior ranks of people are very fond of &s;ending their children to &s;ome of their own univer&s;ities, though it &s;hould be but for a year or two; rather to boa&s;t of it than for any real ad|vantage. The number of per&s;ons in compting hou&s;es, who have had what they call a learned education, is very great; but then it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that there is not that variety of di&s;&s;ipation and expence, at their univer&s;ities, which are the di&s;grace and bane of tho&s;e of Oxford and Cambridge: a young man may, though de&s;igned for trade, be ventured to Leyden or Utrecht, without the danger of its giving him &s;uch a reli&s;h for literature, as to induce him afterwards to think of any other books be&s;ides his journal and ledger; but a mer|chant in this country, who de&s;igns his &s;on for trade, had better hang him than &s;end him to one of our univer|&s;ities; he acquires &s;uch a ta&s;te for extravagance, as to be ever after totally unfit for the prudence and econo|my of commerce: nor is this all; for the morals of the youth at the Dutch univer&s;ity, are much purer than tho&s;e at the Engli&s;h ones; which <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, are little better than the &s;eminaries of vice.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing, &s;ays he, that a new &s;y&s;tem of edu|cation is not introduced into England, for the educa|tion of &s;uch youth as are not intended to be fine gen|tlemen;
<PB N="51" REF="52">
for the &s;ons of the&s;e parents who wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve the morals of their children, as well as their Latin and Greek; the pre&s;ent method is diametrically oppo&s;ite to it. The principal &s;chool in this kingdom is in the capital, and the boys are lodged at private hou&s;es; and this, &s;ays he, is an early introduction into all the vice of London; in&s;tead of this, a &s;chool &s;hould be in as &s;olitary a place as po&s;&s;ible; never in a town, or even in a great village, but in a retired &s;pot, to keep boys from the mi&s;chiefs which the capital every moment pre&s;ents to their youth and inexperience; the &s;ame rule &s;hould be followed at college: in&s;tead of crowding them together, and forming a great town, they &s;hould be &s;ingle, and in the country; this would be taking from their eyes con&s;tant examples of extra|vagance and expence, which all the neighbouring col|lege mu&s;t exhibit. Youth &s;hould &s;pend their time in &s;tudy and recreation; but what recreation proper for them does a town yield? Do not the adjacent fields, commons, or fore&s;ts, exhibit a much better &s;cene of amu&s;ement to brace their &s;trength, confirm their health, and keep them active and lively?</P>
<P>For young men, whether educated at college or in private, Holland abounds in numerous ma&s;ters, who teach the French, and other living languages; and the polite exerci&s;es, &s;uch as dancing, fencing, and mu&s;ic; all which are ea&s;ily learned at the Hague, and their other cities; and they are generally fond of the&s;e

accompli&s;hments. Their daughters are mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly educated in every polite embelli&s;hment, even with more care than our own are in England; con&s;e|quently all the women of any fa&s;hion, affect very much the manners of the French.</P>
<P>It is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that in this trading republic, who&s;e people have &s;o long been famous for their frugality and mode&s;ty, a knowledge and acquain|tance with all tho&s;e embelli&s;hments of life which luxu|ry has &s;pread through Europe, is wanting. On the contrary, though the Dutch are very much changed, their frugality is &s;till more national than in other coun|tries; but it is confined to the lower cla&s;&s;es, or to peo|ple of &s;mall fortune; but among tho&s;e of higher rank, and tho&s;e who are rich, there are &s;carce any people who &s;pend their money more freely, in order to pa&s;s the time agreeably, and enjoy whatever their rank and fortune entitle them to. Large and well furni&s;hed hou&s;es are everywhere to be met with; al&s;o plentiful and elegant tables; numerous &s;ervants; equipages, as in other countries; rich dre&s;&s;es, and &s;ome public di|ver&s;ions; and in the education of their children, no expence is ever &s;pared.</P>
<P>With regard to the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the Dutch, I &s;hall not, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> pretend to analy&s;e them. It is an invidious ta&s;k even for travellers who have long re&s;ided in a country, and much more &s;o for
<PB N="53" REF="54">
one who makes only a &s;hort &s;tay. I &s;hall therefore only remark, that I ob&s;erved a great variety of charac|ters, at which I was not &s;urpri&s;ed; for the va&s;t number of foreigners of all nations and ranks, who are re&s;ident in Holland, mu&s;t certainly very much take off from the appearance of a uniformity of national character. However, the Dutch are certainly a valuable people, and in general po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as many good qualities as their neighbours. They are friendly and &s;in|cere; and the better ranks have a politene&s;s and unaf|fected ea&s;e, which render them very agreeable. No|where are there to be found more learned men, or &s;uch as have &s;een more of the world, than in Holland. Li|terature is much cultivated there, and the pre&s;&s;es of the country are continually teeming with editions of all the capital books printed in France, Germany, Italy, or England; and though this is often done with views of exportation and trade, yet it &s;erves to &s;pread a general knowledge and ta&s;te for literature and the &s;ciences. Such are <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI>'s remarks on the genius of this people, who&s;e writings breathe much more the air of a gentleman than tho&s;e of mo&s;t of our modern tra|vellers; but the&s;e remarks &s;eem more applicable to the higher ranks of people, than to the &s;ubjects at large. With re&s;pect to the lower cla&s;s, when their pa&s;&s;ions are once worked up, there &s;eems to have been in all ages a &s;anguinary ferociou&s;ne&s;s of character among them, which knows no bounds in its cruelties. For example, among other horrors which hi&s;tory has
<PB N="54" REF="55">
traced back, was the murder of <HI>Woleferd</HI> de <HI>Bor&s;elen,</HI> whom the populace of Delft tore to pieces in 1299, under the reign of count <HI>John,</HI> one of their la&s;t counts of Holland. Next, the ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Barend Provis,</HI> Burgoma&s;ter of Utrecht, in the time of the bi&s;hop of Zwedere, whom the people had the barbarity to hack to pieces whil&s;t he was in bed, without paying any re&s;pect to the holy &s;acraments, which were profaned in the hands of the prie&s;t who was admini&s;tering them to him. Afterwards the ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Nicholas van Ruiven,</HI> high bailiff of Haerlem, in 1492; who was torn to pieces alive in the Hotel-de-Ville, and whom his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had the cold-hearted cruelty to cut in pieces and pack up in a ba&s;ket, which they &s;ent to his widow with this horrible in&s;cription: <HI>Mrs. Ruivan, eat the&s;e limbs. Witne&s;s the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the</HI> De Witts <HI>in</HI> 1672, <HI>who&s;e remains were thrown about the &s;treets with the utmo&s;t indifference for &s;everal hours after.</HI> It is only in the&s;e provinces, &s;ays &s;ome French writer, that the common people have the courage to tear the human heart in pieces and eat it. At the &s;iege of Leyden, a &s;ailor devoured the heart of a Spaniard; part of one of the <HI>De Witts</HI> was al&s;o bit off; and if hi&s;|tory does not mi&s;inform us, the heart of Admiral <HI>Co|ligne</HI> was likewi&s;e eat up by the people; add to this, the ri&s;ks which &s;o many brave citizens have run; the in&s;ults they have met with for having &s;erved their country, and the di&s;turbances which are &s;o frequent|ly made before the magi&s;trates' hou&s;es; and likewi&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="56">
before tho&s;e of foreigners of di&s;tinction, if any trifling boon which they think proper to &s;olicit is refu&s;ed them: nor &s;hould the inhumanity with which they treat their pickpockets be omitted, whom the lower cla&s;s of people treat with &s;uch a barbarous &s;everity, if ever they happen to get hold of them, that it is very &s;eldom a pickpocket e&s;capes alive out of their hands; or if he &s;hould, the mi&s;erable wretches generally die of their wounds. All the&s;e incidents and marks of cruelty, at &s;uch di&s;tant intervals from each other, demon&s;trate an invariable and indelible character, which nothing can root out.</P>
<P>This ferociou&s;ne&s;s &s;eems the more &s;urpri&s;ing, when contra&s;ted with that phlegm which predominates in their temperament. A people, from who&s;e appear|ance we might &s;uppo&s;e them grave, tranquil, and even dull, could never be &s;u&s;pected to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much ira&s;ci|bility; but anger a&s;&s;umes force and energy, in propor|tion to its concentration, by its re-action on the &s;prings of the machine. Almo&s;t every author a&s;&s;erts, that the Dutch are laborious; but it is rather by per&s;everance, than activity. This may be &s;een in the watermen, who pull gently, hang on their oars a long time, rub through the day in this employ, and return to it the next with alacrity; and without complaining of their profe&s;&s;ion; &s;low and &s;ure; nor does this &s;low|ne&s;s prevent their arriving at perfection. Philo&s;o|phers pretend to &s;ay, it is their hot drinks, &s;uch as tea
<PB N="56" REF="57">
and coffee, which has weakened the nerves of the Dutch. The lower cla&s;s of people, however, who live at a di&s;tance from great towns, are a plain, civil, kind of people, and will readily hear rea&s;on, if &s;uffi|cient time be given them for that purpo&s;e. As a proof of their hone&s;ty, &s;hould a &s;tranger give them a &s;hilling for what is worth but a groat, they would re|turn him the change, and a&s;k him Why he could be &s;uch a &s;impleton? Their food is chiefly roots, herbs, or milk; and they &s;eem to have no further views than to &s;upply them&s;elves with what nature requires, and make &s;ome &s;mall addition to their &s;tock. It may pro|bably be owing to their diet that their &s;trength and vi|gour is not an&s;werable to their bulk; for they are in general tall and apparently &s;trong built, but very un|wieldy and awkward in their motions, both women as well as men. The &s;eamen are a much rougher kind of people; &s;urly and ill-mannered, which is mi&s;taken for pride, but proceeds from their conver&s;ing with the winds and waves: &s;ailors being a &s;et of people that &s;eldom chu&s;e to u&s;e more words than are nece&s;&s;a|ry. As for the mechanics and the lower order of mer|chants, their wits are much &s;harper than either of the above cla&s;&s;es; and like the Scots <HI>Aubergi&s;te</HI> at Mid|dleburg, exert all their &s;kill, to take advantage of the folly and ignorance of tho&s;e they deal with. This anecdote is as follows; and the editor of this work was pre&s;ent when it took place.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">A Frenchman went to the hou&s;e of a Scots landlady and called for &s;ome coffee, the price of which in Hol|land is a penny a di&s;h; he drank three.&mdash;What had he to pay? Not under&s;tanding Dutch, nor his ho&s;te&s;s French, as &s;he pretended; he takes from his pocket &s;ome double-dutchee pieces, of the value of twopence each, and began to count them into her hand; one, two, three; looking her in the face all the time, and then &s;topped;&mdash;our landlady not content, nodded, and pointed to him to go on; he did, but more &s;lowly than before, as with greater reluctance; &s;topping at every interval, as much as to &s;ay. Is not that enough? She nodding at him to go on; when he came to eight or nine, his patience was exhau&s;ted; at which &s;he roars out with great impetuo&s;ity, for &s;he then could &s;peak French: <HI>Croyez vous que je &s;erai contente avec &ccedil;a?</HI> And thus made him give her two or three more. Being a&s;ked by an Engli&s;h gentleman pre&s;ent, when the Frenchman was gone, how &s;he could in con|&s;cience take near half-a crown for three di&s;h&eacute;s of cof|fee, value only threepence? She replied, with a &s;igni|ficant &s;mile&mdash;as he had never been in Middleburg be|fore, it was proper to make him pay his footing.</P>
<P>The members of the &s;tates will &s;ometimes employ their money in commerce, by keeping hou&s;es and &s;ervants for that purpo&s;e; but the generality of them live upon the pen&s;ions of their offices, and the rents of their land or hou&s;es; and it is &s;eldom that the&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="59">
families get great e&s;tates, though they are continual|ly in the magi&s;tracy, the &s;alaries of their office being very incon&s;iderable. The nobility, as has been ob|&s;erved, are not numerous in Holland; many of their families having been extingui&s;hed in the wars with Spain: and it does not appear, that there is any power lodged in the States-general or the Stadt|holder to create fre&s;h nobles. They affect rather the garb of the neighbouring courts, than the popular air of their own country. They look upon it &s;o di&s;honourable to marry beneath their rank, that they will &s;carce &s;ubmit to it, to patch up a broken for|tune. Frugality, all ranks of people po&s;&s;e&s;s more or le&s;s. This enables them to bear the heavy bur|thens that are laid upon them. And from hence proceeds the beauty and &s;trength of their towns, the magnificence of their canals, and public buildings, their plea&s;ant &s;haded walks, to all which a Dutchman contributes with as much alacrity as people in other countries expend their property in the embelli&s;hment of their private e&s;tates.</P>
<P>Certainly nothing adds more to the beauty of their cities, as well as of the country in general, than the plantations of trees, for the public u&s;e and plea&s;ure. In England things of this &s;ort are often done, but more for private gratifications than the general delight of the people; &s;o that the lower cla&s;&s;es are more apt to crowd to gardens, where they pay their mo|ney,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
wa&s;te their time, and &s;ometimes debauch them|&s;elves with exce&s;&s;es. We may ob&s;erve, however, to the honour of Great-Britain, that within the&s;e thirty years, great inprovements have been made in many parts of the kingdom. Works of this nature, for the public recreation, are worthy of the be&s;t citizens, the mo&s;t zealous patriots, and the greate&s;t princes.</P>
<P>The accuracy of the Dutch in ca&s;ting up their ex|pences is &s;o ju&s;t, that no per&s;on engages in any thing he is not prepared for. And it is very un|u&s;ual to hear of any public or private building not being fini&s;hed by the time it was agreed on. Their charity is rather national, than directed to the com|mon objects of compa&s;&s;ion; ho&s;pitals they have out of number; but there are none perhaps more ad|mired by all foreigners than the one e&s;tabli&s;hed at Enchuy&s;en for aged &s;eamen, which is &s;o contrived as that tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed their lives in the dangers and hard&s;hips of a &s;ea-faring life, &s;hould enjoy in this retreat every &s;atisfaction and convenience which old age is capable of.</P>
<P>The Dutch, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed for the number and economy of their u&s;eful charities, which &s;eem to exceed tho&s;e of England, not in extent; for in beneficence the Engli&s;h have hardly any bounds, as if they meant in good earne&s;t to cover a multitude of &s;ins; but in regard to di&s;cipline and whole&s;ome &s;eve|rity,
<PB N="60" REF="61">
we have not &s;upported it &s;o well as the Dutch, who make all their poor perform &s;ome u&s;eful labour. It does not, indeed, &s;eem po&s;&s;ible to engage the lowe&s;t &s;ort of people of any nation to work from a &s;en&s;e of duty. If they are left to their choice, or the materials of labour with-held from them, it cannot be expected that they will work; but, if the make and con&s;titution of man render labour nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;upport, it fol|lows, that he who can work and will not work, &s;hall not have food given him. Charities founded on prin|ciples not con&s;i&s;tent with this rule, in&s;tead of drawing down ble&s;&s;ings, produce calamities, as is often experi|enced.</P>
<P>All pa&s;&s;ions, that of avarice excepted, run in gene|ral lower and cooler here, than in other countries. Quarrels are very rare, revenge &s;eldom heard of, nor is jealou&s;y &s;carce ever known. Their tempers and di&s;po&s;itions are not airy enough for joy, or &s;trains of humour; nor warm enough for love. This is in|deed, &s;ometimes talked of by young per&s;ons, as a thing they have heard of, but never felt; and as a di&s;|cour&s;e that becomes, rather than affects, them. Some writers account for this indifference to the &s;ex as proceeding from the heavine&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, which renders them le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of more refined pa&s;&s;ions; others con&s;ider it as the clo&s;e application which every man gives to his own concerns. This uncommon a&s;&s;iduity is remarkable in every thing they
<PB N="61" REF="62">
undertake. There are in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have be&s;towed between twenty and thirty years in making and fini&s;hing a globe; others a &s;till longer time in the mere inlaying of a table. Nor is it to be conceived how much this a&s;&s;iduity of application, in never giving over what they have once taken in hand, may have contributed to the atchieving of tho&s;e wonderful ac|tions which they have performed: not committing that fault which people of a more volatile di&s;po&s;ition are apt to run into, the leaving of one pur&s;uit to follow another. This con&s;tancy of employment and cold|ne&s;s of complexion, and perhaps the nature of their food al&s;o, may contribute to their being but little given to gallantry. The &s;ame cau&s;es may here have had the &s;ame effect among the married women, who have the whole management of their dome&s;tic con|cerns, and who are generally of a very irreproach|able character; cha&s;tity being hereditary and ha|bitual to them. The men place &s;uch confidence in their wives as to make them acquainted with all their private affairs, and &s;eldom undertake any thing without their knowledge and approbation. Another writer, &s;peaking of the middling ranks of life, &s;ays, that the women have the reputation of being very faithful to their hu&s;bands, though they do not &s;eem to pay much regard to cha&s;tity before marriage. Some of them have good complexions, though not very beautiful; and their teeth are in general bad. Their children, for the mo&s;t part, till they
<PB N="62" REF="63">
arrive at the age of eight or ten years, are weak and &s;ickly; and indeed the women &s;eem &s;o ince&s;&s;antly employed in cleaning their hou&s;es and other offices, of which &s;ome are in common with their hu&s;|bands; that they do not appear to afford them&s;elves re&s;t enough to breed children, or at lea&s;t give &s;uf|ficent attention to them, after they have brought them forth. The women in this country &s;eldom breed after the age of thirty. As the men are remarkable for the many breeches they wear, &s;o are the women for wearing one pair; they u&s;e pots with live coals of wood or turf, which they &s;et in boxes bored full of holes, and put between their legs, to warm them in cold weather; this is not only apt to make them old from the wai&s;t downward, before the time ordained by nature, but the &s;mell of the coals is offen&s;ive: and they have a proverbial &s;aying in Holland, that the dirtie&s;t piece of furniture in the hou&s;e of a Dutch|man is his wife.</P>
<P>Whether it be the remains of any jealou&s;y which they have retained &s;ince the time of the Spani&s;h government, or the mere effect of prudence, I could not help ob&s;erving, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> that many of them will not mention their wives in company, nor do they &s;eem plea&s;ed that others &s;hould &s;peak of them, though in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms. It might be pre&s;umed, that where the laws are &s;o favourable to the women, as to give them at lea&s;t an equal
<PB N="63" REF="64">
&s;hare of dominion with their hu&s;bands, that conver|&s;ation &s;hould be more free; this conduct, however, may be imputed to that incommunicative manner of life, in which the lower and middle &s;orts of the peo|ple are bred up.</P>
<P>As a proof of the extraordinary neatne&s;s of the Dutch, which is fully expatiated on, under the article of North Holland, as well as the a&s;cendency which wo|men have over their hu&s;bands, Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> re|lates, that being at the hou&s;e of one of the burgo|ma&s;ters of Am&s;terdam, whil&s;t he was amba&s;&s;ador in Holland, and having a &s;evere cold, he ob&s;erved every time he &s;pit, that a clever hand&s;ome wench, who &s;tood in the room, with a clean cloth in her hand, pre&s;ently wiped it up and rubbed the board clean. Sir <HI>William</HI> expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the trouble he gave, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e told him, if his wife had been at home, he would not have come off &s;o well; for that &s;he would probably have turned him out of the hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding he was an amba&s;&s;ador; adding, that there were two rooms in his hou&s;e which he dur&s;t never go into, and he believed they were never opened but twice a year to be cleaned. Sir <HI>William</HI> remarking that the wives of Am&s;terdam gene|rally governed their hu&s;bands, and that this &s;eemed part of their con&s;titution; the burgoma&s;ter replied, It was true, and that all a man could hope for was an ea&s;y governe&s;s. This occa&s;ioning many plea&s;ant
<PB N="64" REF="65">
&s;tories to be told concerning the extragavant neat|ne&s;s of the Dutch ladies in their hou&s;es, the &s;ecre|tary of Am&s;terdam who was pre&s;ent, pointed to a hou&s;e oppo&s;ite, where he &s;aid one of their magi&s;trates went to pay a vi&s;it to the mi&s;tre&s;s, a &s;trapping North Holland la&s;s, happening to open the door to him, and ob&s;erving as he was coming in, that his &s;hoes were not very clean, the wench took him by both arms, threw him on her back, and carrying him through two rooms &s;et him down at the bottom of the &s;tairs, and then pulling off his &s;hoes and putting a pair of &s;lippers on him, &s;he told him, without hav|ing &s;aid a word to him before, that he might walk up to her mi&s;tre&s;s who was in her chamber.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their dre&s;s, the trade&s;men, mer|chants and higher cla&s;s of people, dre&s;s very much after the manner of the Engli&s;h and French, as will be hereafter noticed; with this difference, that their cloaths do not vary according to the &s;ea&s;ons as in France, any more than the furniture of their hou&s;es, which are covered with carpets in mid&s;t of &s;ummer as in winter. The dre&s;s of the lower cla&s;s of people to an Engli&s;hman appears clum&s;y and awkward, though it is admirably well adapted to the coldne&s;s and moi&s;|ture of their climates. Their coats have neither &s;hapes nor plaits, and their long pockets are fixed as high up as their ribs; they are al&s;o remarkable for wearing very large breeches. But the dre&s;s of the
<PB N="65" REF="66">
women appears &s;till more &s;ingular; their cloaths coming only half way down their legs; head-dre&s;s they have &s;carce any, but content them&s;elves with tying up their hair, and wearing three black knots on their head, and &s;ometimes a hood. Their ladies of plea&s;ure who frequent the Spill-hou&s;es, are generally dre&s;&s;ed in a coat and jacket, very much re&s;embling the riding habits worn in England. Their burgoma&s;|ters like our coun&s;ellors, u&s;ually dre&s;s in black, full trimmed, with a flowing wig.</P>
<P>As to diet, that of the hu&s;handman or boors, con|&s;i&s;ts, as we have already &s;aid, chiefly of roots, herbs, &s;our-milk, and pul&s;e; in towns, the common people fare &s;omething better. About November, the coun|try people purcha&s;e an ox, or &s;ometimes more than one, according to the largene&s;s of the family; this they &s;alt, and afterwards &s;moak-dry it to eat, with bread, butter, and &s;allad. Pickled herrings, Bologna &s;au&s;ages, and other &s;avory di&s;hes, are much admired by the Dutch; when they have fre&s;h fi&s;h, it is gene|rally eaten with oiled butter, which tho&s;e who are ac|cu&s;tomed to it, prefer to good melted butter: they have &s;everal other methods of dre&s;&s;ing their fi&s;h, to which a little u&s;e will reconcile an Engli&s;h palate; &s;lounders they dry gradually, and eat them with &s;alt, without any further dre&s;&s;ing. Their butter and chee&s;e are e&s;teemed very good, of which the common people are &s;o very greedy, that they &s;eldom travel without a
<PB N="66" REF="67">
butter-box in their pocket; this box is made in the &s;hape of a churn, and will hold about half a pound of butter. As they travel on their canals, a pea&s;ant with his roll and butter-box, and half-a-pint of gin, makes a very comfortable meal; and &s;o extravagantly fond are the Dutch of this article of diet, that they will &s;ometimes eat it by &s;poonfuls; but the Dutch do not now feed upon that &s;imple diet they were accu&s;tomed to formerly; and the di&s;hes of every neighbouring nation are to be met with in Holland. The table|d'h&ocirc;tes in the fir&s;t repute at Am&s;terdam, and the Hague more particularly, are furni&s;hed with a profu|&s;ion of eatables and delicacies, fit for the table of a nobleman. Among the higher cla&s;s of citizens they carry their luxury to a great pitch. In the article of poultry alone, it is cu&s;tomary in the month of March, to give a guinea for a green goo&s;e, which at that &s;ea|&s;on of the year in Holland, is very &s;carce. The method to rear them is by keeping them in a large barn, in the middle of which they have a pond and a large fire.</P>
<P>In liquors they have very much the advantage of us; for they have not only good beer, but al&s;o wine and brandy, equally good and in great plenty; their geneva al&s;o, to which the common people are known to be no enemy, is equally good and cheap. Sir <HI>Wil|liam Temple</HI> ob&s;erves, that it is nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e people &s;hould tipple, as well for the improvement of their un|der&s;tanding,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
as the pre&s;ervation of their health. For though exce&s;s of liquor may clog the parts of tho&s;e who live in better climates, and are of a warmer con|&s;titution; yet it benefits tho&s;e who are of a cold con|&s;titution and live in a heavy atmo&s;phere; and perhaps may be even nece&s;&s;ary to thaw the frozen and inac|tive &s;pirits of the brain. Yet the magi&s;trates and per|&s;ons of high office, are &s;eldom addicted to this vice. As for the merchants and trade&s;men, with whom it is not unu&s;ual, they never drink in the morning; and will not even offer a &s;tranger any liquor in a morning, but excu&s;e them&s;elves on account of the time of day.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ions of the Dutch are bowls, billiards, che&s;s and tennis; games of chance they &s;eldom play at. Angling in &s;ummer, and &s;hooting wild fowl in winter, make another part of their recreation. In winter when their canals are frozen, &s;kaiting and being drawn along in &s;ledges, is an amu&s;ement of which they are very fond; it is incredible with what rapidity &s;ome of them will move with their &s;kaits, &s;o that no running hor&s;e can keep pace with them; the women as well as men are accu&s;tomed to this exerci&s;e in Holland, and will frequently &s;kait with their goods on their heads, 20 miles to market, and return in the evening. Their &s;ledges are either drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, or pu&s;hed along by a per&s;on with &s;kaits on. When the &s;now is on the ground, and the &s;treets frozen, the young per&s;ons of rank in the republic, appear abroad
<PB N="68" REF="69">
in magnificent &s;ledges. Every gentleman drives his own hor&s;e, which is covered with a rich &s;kin, and the hor&s;e likewi&s;e is adorned with a fine tuft of feathers, and the gentleman and lady, for there is generally a lady in the &s;ledge, behind whom the gentleman &s;its, wrapped up in furs. The &s;ledges are of various &s;hapes, finely painted, gilt, and varni&s;hed, and the hor&s;e's har|ne&s;s very rich and glittering. Numbers of the&s;e are frequently &s;een in Am&s;terdam making a very long train, and which appear a very beautiful &s;ight; we have given a plate of &s;uch <HI>traineaus</HI> in our de&s;cription of Vienna. In &s;ummer, multitudes of people may be &s;een walking on the banks of the&s;e canals, which are &s;haded by trees, or on the &s;ea &s;hore, or in the public gardens. But at the end of every walk is the tavern, where they do not fail to meet with a thou&s;and little amu&s;ements, and agreeable entertainments; &s;uch as cool &s;ummer-hou&s;es, and grottos; excellent wines, and other liquors, with fruits and cakes; to which are added mu&s;ical in&s;truments of all kinds; nor are the&s;e plea&s;ures dear; ordinary workmen may in|dulge them&s;elves in the&s;e recreations, whil&s;t in other countries it is ob&s;erved, that this cla&s;s of people ge|nerally wants bread to eat. Nor are the &s;ame di&s;|tinctions kept up in Holland between the wealthy tra|ders and the mechanics, as in other countries. They conver&s;e very much on a level, and it is not very ea&s;y to know the man from the ma&s;ter, or the maid from the mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;uch liberties do they allow to their &s;er|vants, who may not be &s;truck or corrected by them;
<PB N="69" REF="70">
but the di&s;pute mu&s;t be &s;ettled before a magi&s;trate, it not being proper that any one &s;hould be judge in his own cau&s;e. They will &s;ometimes take a boat and go with all their family to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, in order to eat river-fi&s;h at &s;ome tavern in the country. Nor &s;hould it be forgotten, that the drinking of tea has long been univer&s;al among all &s;orts of people, and not e&s;teemed one of the wor&s;t of their entertainments.</P>
<P>The Dutch, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> are &s;o well convinced that much diver&s;ion not only creates expence, but likewi&s;e calls the mind from bu&s;ine&s;s and dome&s;tic duties, that in Am&s;terdam they permit no public &s;hews within the walls of their city. After &s;even in the evening, every per&s;on that pa&s;&s;es the gates pays one &s;tiver; and a coach five &s;tivers, &s;o that di|ver&s;ions are taxed with this impo&s;t. It is not how|ever, very con&s;iderable, for the people have not a great pa&s;&s;ion for theatrical entertainments, which are not permitted on Sundays. They have a theatre at Am&s;terdam, where Dutch plays are performed, but it is a poor one. The amu&s;ements in which the Dutch have the greate&s;t pretence to delicacy, is that of gar|dening; almo&s;t every merchant has his little garden fitted up with great neatne&s;s and expence, in which there is generally a &s;mall &s;ummer-hou&s;e, &s;ituated on the borders of &s;ome beautiful canal, where he goes the latter part of the week to regale him&s;elf with his pipe, and enjoy the picture&s;que views of his garden, and the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
moving &s;cenes which the canal affords him, till the Monday following. In the great commercial towns of Holland, there are clubs on a &s;imilar footing with tho&s;e in England, in which the members mu&s;t be bal|loted for, and where they meet every evening to take their tea, to &s;moak, and talk over the topics of the day. Any &s;tranger is admitted into the&s;e &s;ocieties, on being pre&s;ented by one of the members. Nor mu&s;t we omit a very ridiculous cu&s;tom kept up among the middling and lower cla&s;s of people&mdash;that of weighing them&s;elves. In all the fairs it is cu&s;tomary for the Dutch to have them&s;elves weighed, as it is with the lower cla&s;s of people, with us, to purcha&s;e fairings. There are per&s;ons who attend with weigh|ing &s;cales in the markets and fairs, to weigh people, for which they charge a doit each per&s;on. From whence &s;o ab&s;urd a cu&s;tom could have had its ri&s;e, is not ea&s;y to conceive; unle&s;s it is, that they e&s;teem their con|&s;equence in proportion to their weight. The Dutch are, in general, large, unweildy people, partaking of the moi&s;ture of their climate; the better cla&s;s of elderly women add a hoop to their dre&s;s to increa&s;e that bulk; it is a bell-hoop that inclo&s;es them all round equally; whereas, &s;ervant-maids who wear hoops occa&s;ionally, wear &s;uch hoops only as &s;pread their hips; this with the cu&s;tomary que&s;tion to &s;trangers, at the fir&s;t inter|view; of "How old are you?"&mdash;"How much do you weigh?" And the circum&s;tance of weighing &s;cales, at markets and fairs, would naturally lead a &s;tranger
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="71" REF="73">
to &s;uppo&s;e, as I ob&s;erved, that they e&s;timate their con|&s;equence in proportion to their increa&s;e of weight.</P>
<P>It is not unplea&s;ant to &s;ee an Am&s;terdam girl going to a tea-hou&s;e without the city, with her gallant. Figure to your&s;elf a large, bouncing wench, &s;quare built, with her arms dangling by her &s;ide, trimming up her head, and taking pains to di&s;tort her figure; &s;he turns in her toes to walk, as &s;he thinks, genteelly. On her little head is a plain mu&s;lin cap, that &s;carce covers her ears; and a black &s;ilk hat &s;tuck on behind, on the crown of her head; a mu&s;lin handkerchief hermetical|ly clo&s;ed with a pin before, and cro&s;&s;ed and pinned under the arm; on her neck, above the handkerchief, hangs a gold or gilt bead-necklace; her rump is en|clo&s;ed in a hoop that gives her a barrel form below; and a pair of &s;tays that rolls her into the form of a &s;maller tub, above; her upper garment is a &s;hort &s;triped, cotton bedgown, laced before, that drops ju&s;t below her hips, and a red or green &s;tuff petticoat, &s;trutting a foot and a half on each &s;ide the wai&s;t; the whole forming a bulky contra&s;t to her little head; this petticoat is &s;hort enough to expo&s;e a very thick leg and large foot, which &s;carce enters a &s;mall black &s;hoe, with red heels, and fa&s;tened on by an enormous buckle on the toe. Her gallant, with his hair rolled up above his ears; his large hat right up and down, three quar|ters of a yard from corner to corner; coat buttoned tight over the brea&s;t, &s;trutting before her with his
<PB N="72" REF="74">
hands in his pockets, leaves her to follow him all the way on the road; and when they have got there, he funks her with tobacco, though in a &s;ultry hot evening.</P>
<P>The ordinary mode of travelling in Holland, is in Trech&s;chuyts drawn by one hor&s;e, and which are in &s;hape much like a city-barge in London, only more &s;imple and le&s;s ornamented. They move at the rate of three miles an hour, for which the fare does not amount above a penny a mile. The only &s;tops they make, are at certain little towns, where they &s;top to regale, and from which they expect to take in fre&s;h pa&s;&s;engers. The&s;e boats hold about fifteen pa&s;&s;engers in the cabin, or covered room, with convenience; but the mi&s;chief is, the ma&s;ter or &s;kipper, will crowd it with twenty, or even five-and-twenty, on account of the profit of the fares; and indeed if he could &s;tow them as clo&s;e, he would &s;tuff it as full as a barrel of herrings. Some per&s;ons, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> who pretend to give an exact account of Holland, &s;ay, that travelling in the&s;e boats is the mo&s;t agreeable thing in the world. In re&s;pect to cheapne&s;s it is &s;o. We are told likewi&s;e, &s;ays he, the pa&s;&s;engers may talk, knit, &s;ew, read, and do whatever they like, which is mo&s;t undoubtedly true; they perform all their agreeable functions, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as they are performed in an Engli&s;h &s;tage-coach, in which &s;ix are crammed, all perhaps great fat, or corpulent wretches, that are made only to be a
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="75">
<HEAD>A TRECHSCHYT</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="73" REF="76">
plague to the next on the &s;eat. I can conceive that a &s;tage-coach half full, and with none but agreeable company in it, may prove a very plea&s;ant conveyance, but what are the&s;e boa&s;ted trech&s;chuyts, when there is a dozen Dutch boors in them; who &s;etting at nought, the cleanline&s;s of their country, will &s;pit clo&s;e at your feet, whatever be your rank, will &s;hew as little idea of civility or even humanity, as the mo&s;t drunken hack|ney-coachman at London, and will continue &s;moak|ing, though a foreign lady &s;hould be pre&s;ent, unaccu&s;|tomed to this practice, and faint with &s;uffocation. The better cla&s;s of people who travel in them, generally be&s;peak the cabin or roof, as it is called, to them&s;elves; and pay a price accordingly, in which ca&s;e no other per&s;on is admitted on the journey. But what can be expected from a conveyance, that carries per&s;ons at the rate of a penny a mile? If travelling is very cheap, very low, very vulgar people will travel. At Lon|don there are &s;tages that go five or &s;ix miles for a &s;hill|ing. What can be more dete&s;table? The cheapne&s;s induces all the blackguards who were born to u&s;e their feet, not coaches, to become pa&s;&s;engers; and a gentleman, or any man that has two ideas in his head, is offended at the lowne&s;s of the company he meets in them. Nothing can be more &s;elf-evident, than that every thing which is cheap, is made or managed with a peculiar view to tho&s;e that are poor, and will in ge|neral &s;uit them only. It may be &s;aid that men of edu|cation, genius, and &s;cience, are often poor; but what
<PB N="74" REF="77">
then? Is a per&s;on to be pe&s;tered with the company of half a dozen of Dutch boors, becau&s;e it is probable, a man of genius may now and then honour it with his pre&s;ence? But to do ju&s;tice to the&s;e boats, if the fare was more, they would be a mo&s;t agreeable mode of travelling; they are well built; the cabin a good room; with windows &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that a traveller has a plea&s;ing view of the country. The&s;e boats in gene|ral &s;et off every hour or every two hours, on the ring|ing of a bell, and &s;o very punctual are the &s;kippers, that they will not wait an in&s;tant for a pa&s;&s;enger, who is not at the water-&s;ide by the time the bell has done ringing. Tho&s;e who travel with much baggage in the&s;e trech&s;chuyts are liable to great impo&s;ition; the &s;kip|per will charge as much for a &s;mall trunk, as for a large one; and the porters who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to carry the baggage from one boat to another, will frequently de|mand three or four times as much as they ought to have, again&s;t which impo&s;ition there is no remedy. A pa&s;|&s;enger mu&s;t employ the porters belonging to the boat, or none. In tho&s;e parts of Holland in which there are no canals, the u&s;ual mode of travelling is in light, open waggons; coaches may be had in all the capital cities, but then being obliged to be drawn by four hor&s;es, travelling charges come high. They have likewi&s;e two or four wheel carriages drawn by two hor&s;es; the bodies of which very much re&s;emble the wor&s;t of our old-fa&s;hioned one-hor&s;e chai&s;es: the pace they travel is about that of a higler's cart; though
<PB N="75" REF="78">
they are fine beautiful black hor&s;es, 17 hands high, coal-black, without a di&s;coloured &s;peck, with very long cre&s;ted necks, or fore-hands, heavy, but &s;tately; the&s;e will trot 10 miles an hour, and are called va&s;t-trotters; and they will &s;ell in Holland for 220l. the pair. It may be ea&s;ily imagined in a low country like Holland, where the &s;oil is either very loomy or very &s;andy, which it is in the upper parts of Holland, that the roads cannot be very good, except in &s;ome particular parts, where they have within the&s;e few years made paved roads. Carriages like our Engli&s;h po&s;t-chai&s;es, they have none, either in Holland, or on any part of the conti|nent. A traveller in Holland is &s;ure to meet with good beds, and clean linen; and in the hotels, with civil treatment and rea&s;onable charges; that is, they will not take advantage of a &s;tranger, making a bar|gain before-hand; but in the le&s;&s;er public-hou&s;es, are frequently guilty of very gro&s;s impo&s;itions upon &s;trangers, particularly tho&s;e foreigners who keep inns in the &s;eaport towns, and who are the refu&s;e of the&s;e countries and France. Whenever they have an oppor|tunity to fleece a traveller, they &s;hew him no mercy; and if a per&s;on attempts to di&s;pute their bill, they are affronted, and in&s;tantly increa&s;e it; this frequently hap|pens even in the fir&s;t hotels. Complaint being made that a bill is three or four &s;hillings overcharged, it is in&s;tantly returned with an additional two &s;hillings, or eighteen-pence, which is pretended was forgot; the re&s;t of the charges remaining as before. In this country it is
<PB N="76" REF="79">
always the cu&s;tom for a per&s;on to pay for his pa&s;&s;age, before he has well begun his journey; for as &s;oon as the pa&s;&s;engers are &s;et down in the boat, a fellow comes round with a hat and collects the money, &s;o that if any accident &s;hould happen to prevent their reaching their places of de&s;tination, (which &s;ometimes is the ca&s;e in pa&s;&s;age-boats, by their running on &s;ome &s;and-bank,) the traveller is obliged to be at the expence of a fre&s;h conveyance. When any per&s;on takes one of the&s;e pa&s;&s;age boats on his own account, either to cro&s;s the Zuyder-&s;ea, or to go from Rotterdam into Flanders, or to the Brill, it is not unfrequent with them to extort a guinea extraordinary, for a bed in the cabin, after they have made their agreement; in &s;hort, there is no country where &s;trangers, unaccu&s;tomed to their man|ners and travelling with baggage, is liable to more im|po&s;ition than in Holland, to which they are encou|raged, as the magi&s;trates almo&s;t always take their parts, much more than tho&s;e of other countries do. There is a mean however, which every traveller &s;hould remember in Holland or el&s;ewhere, to be neither too economical or litigious, nor too profane or negligent. <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> has a very good remark on this head, in the account of the treatment he met with, at a little inn in North Holland. I &s;topped, &s;ays he, at an inn, where I met with indifferent accommodations; the landlord &s;hewed me on my fir&s;t coming, into a kind of a com|mon room, where there were many &s;orts of gue&s;ts; I told him I mu&s;t have a room to my&s;elf, he replied
<PB N="77" REF="80">
in Engli&s;h, that he had none; upon which I ordered the be&s;t &s;upper his town would afford; a bottle of claret, and another of white wine, on condition that I had a room; this brought him to his be&s;t behaviour, and I was accommodated to my wi&s;h. This is one in&s;tance in a thou&s;and, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> in which travel|lers receive a treatment in proportion to the money they &s;pend; nor &s;hould tho&s;e who are apt to be too economical, condemn the inns and landlords of a country, when they mind only keeping their money in their pockets. But whenever a tour is in contem|plation, either at home or abroad, it is &s;urely never worth while to &s;ave fifty or three&s;core pounds in five hundred, and thereby render a long journey di&s;agre|able: this is a remark which every traveller &s;hould continually bear in mind, and not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be put out of temper on his journey by trifling impo|&s;itions, which are perpetually occurring; and in le&s;|&s;er inns nowhere more than in Holland.</P>
<P>Marriage, in this country, is con&s;idered as a civil contract; it is the magi&s;trate who publi&s;hes the banns, and joins the parties; and there are many per&s;ons who con&s;ider the mini&s;ter's ble&s;&s;ing as no longer nece&s;&s;ary. The ceremony of marriage is made as &s;imple as po&s;&s;i|ble; the only di&s;tinction is wealth. When a couple therefore pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the magi&s;trate to be joined together in holy matrimony, he gives them a paper divided into different cla&s;&s;es of riches, in which
<PB N="78" REF="81">
each couple names the column they chu&s;e. There are five of the&s;e columns, the fir&s;t are for tho&s;e who are im|men&s;ely rich, the &s;econd for tho&s;e who are very rich, the third for tho&s;e who are le&s;s rich, the fourth for tho&s;e who are &s;till le&s;s &s;o, and the fifth and the la&s;t cla&s;s for tho&s;e who are poor. The column being fixed on, the tax is in proportion to the wealth of the parties, who &s;eldom fail in&s;cribing their names in a column above their real &s;ituation. There is likewi&s;e an addi|tional tax to be paid, for coming to the town-hou&s;e in a carriage.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ions for the burials in Holland are &s;imi+lar to tho&s;e in England. They u&s;ually inter their corp&s;es as in Scotland, about the middle of the day, with a long train of coaches following the hear&s;e. In Holland there is a particular per&s;on in every pari&s;h who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to go round and give notice to the friends of the decea&s;ed, of his death, and invite them to the funeral; they are called <HI>Bidders.</HI> This man, ac|companied with the footman of the family, goes, dre&s;&s;ed in black, with a cloak, a large hat, and di&s;|&s;hevelled hair, and gets a deal of money by this means; the greater &s;igns of grief he &s;hews, the more money he collects. They likewi&s;e give notice of the day of baptizing any child, to the friends and acquain|tances of the parents, who are to be invited to the bapti&s;mal fe&s;tival, and in this &s;ervice they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="79" REF="82">
by a large white cravat, with gloves of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not, however, omit the &s;ingular cu&s;toms which takes place at the burial of the <HI>bourgeois.</HI>&mdash;The per&s;ons who have e&s;corted the corp&s;e to the burial ground, return back to the hou&s;e of the de|cea&s;ed, in order to pay their compliments to the widow, or the hu&s;band, or the children. The&s;e by cu&s;tom, are obliged to give drink to &s;ixty or an hun|dred people, which is the number that generally at|tends a funeral. After having drank two or three gla&s;&s;es, every one returns home, except the intimate friends of the decea&s;ed, to whom an elegant enter|tainment is &s;erved up, at which it would be very in|decorous for the widow or widower not to be pre|&s;ent, and even to do the honours of the table. All the gue&s;ts of cour&s;e, do their utmo&s;t to con&s;ole the afflicted party, the gla&s;s goes circling round, bumper after bumper, the fumes of the wine mount to the brain, and from drinking they fall to &s;inging and dancing till the next morning day-light; and it is not infrequent to &s;ee a widow, at their entertainments, all in tears, and dancing with the greate&s;t glee imagin|able. The ancient laws of Overy&s;&s;el forbid the cu&s;tom of drinking at burials.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of their Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of Holland was rai&s;ed chiefly on the ruins of Antwerp, once the mi&s;tre&s;s of the com|mercial world, till the fiery zeal of prie&s;ts and the in&s;olence of military authority, trampled equally upon ju&s;tice and humanity, and la&s;tly upon commerce, the &s;upport of nations. Towards the &s;ixteenth century, the Portugue&s;e al&s;o, from being the greate&s;t traders to the ea&s;t, began to decline in their commerce; which gave the more room to this new colony of merchants, who had many of the requi&s;ites, to carry trade to its highe&s;t pitch, though their country does not produce a &s;ingle material for building &s;hips.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider things as they &s;tand; Am&s;terdam is a prodigious magazine of timber, corn, wine, and many other commodities of foreign, European produc|tions. The inhabitants excel in dying, &s;ugar-baking, bleaching of linen and wax, manufacturing of paper and &s;ail-cloth, with no incon&s;iderable quantity of &s;ilk and wool. Their whale-fi&s;hery generally pro|duces great riches, and their Ea&s;t-India trade is of the highe&s;t importance to them, both in Europe and
<PB N="81" REF="84">
A&s;ia; the article of &s;pices only, is a mine of gold, which they have pre&s;erved with more care and a&s;&s;i|duity, than if it had been really &s;uch. Here are al&s;o great repo&s;itories of gold and &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, and choice drugs from different parts of the world. In regard to the balance of trade between Great Britain and the United Provinces, the linens, flax, &s;ail-cloth, tiles, juniper berries, &amp;c. which this nation takes of the Dutch, much exceed in value, the lead, tin, tobacco, and coals which they take of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> from whom we give this extract, that their herring fi&s;hery is a &s;ource of riches to them. Per&s;ons of every age and deno|mination delight in this &s;ort of food; there is hardly a family in the United Provinces but con&s;umes a bar|rel. The quantities which they &s;end into foreign markets, and convert into money is very great. One would imagine that the happy &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould have rendered this trade unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Such is the conci&s;e account which this writer, di&s;tingui&s;hed for his commercial, as well as literary abilities, gives of their trade. But as this is an object of much re&s;earch, it may not be ami&s;s to dilate a little more on this &s;ubject, by making &s;ome extracts from another writer, <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> the principal bent of who&s;e travels was to lay before his readers &s;uch accounts of
<PB N="82" REF="85">
the agriculture, manufactures and commerce of the countries he had pa&s;&s;ed through, as had never before been pre&s;ented to the public. Navigation, the fi&s;heries, commerce, and manufactures, &s;ays <HI>De Witt,</HI> are the four columns o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tate, and the&s;e <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> &s;eems to have treated with brevity, accuracy and judgment. He divides the Dutch commerce of Europe into the different countries to which they trade.</P>
<P>The country with which he begins, is the Baltic: be|fore the act of navigation, (made in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time,) took place in England, the commerce of the Baltic employed near 1,200 Dutch &s;hips annually, which for the mo&s;t part went half loaded, and returned wholly &s;o. Norway alone employed three hundred &s;hips every year. This act having re&s;trained the carrying trade of the Dutch to the commodities produced in Holland, their commerce to the north at once &s;uf|fered a great diminution, and the increa&s;e of our marine augmented in England the con&s;umption of the commodities of the north, proper for the con&s;truc|tion of &s;hips, which weakened the commerce of the Dutch in the north &s;ea, by the competition of the Eng|li&s;h. The number of &s;hips we now &s;end to Peter&s;|burgh, is more than double that of the Dutch. The principal trade which the Dutch have at pre&s;ent in the Baltic is with Dantzick, from whence they bring amazing quantities of corn, and in return, &s;upply Po|land through that city with more commodities than
<PB N="83" REF="86">
any other nation in Europe, particularly Ea&s;t-India goods, wines, brandy, and all &s;orts of manufacture.</P>
<P>The trade of very con&s;iderable tracks in the north of Germany centers at Hamburgh, but the central and &s;outhern parts of the empire are &s;upplied in a great degree by the Dutch: they have al&s;o a large trade with Bremen and Embden, for the &s;upply of the in|terior country; but the commerce of the Rhine is mo&s;t con&s;iderable. This navigation goes far into Switzerland, and by means of the Mo&s;elle, the Maine and the Necker, a prodigious extent of populous country, with many great town, are connected and trade immediately to Holland. The indu&s;trious ci|ty of Nuremberg &s;ends a variety of manufactures, par|ticularly toys, of which in England there is a va&s;t con|&s;umption, and which are called Dutch toys, becau&s;e we have them from Holland.</P>
<P>By means of the navigation of the Rhine, the Dutch &s;erve the four electorates of the Rhine, Sarbruck, Deux-Ponts, Baden, Wirtemberg, the Bri&s;gau, Spire|back, Al&s;ace, almo&s;t all Switzerland and the greate&s;t part of Lorraine, with all &s;orts of &s;piceries, drugs, oils, rice, whalebone, tin, copper, bra&s;s wire, &s;ugar, tea, cof|fee, the wines of France and Spain, brandies, dried fruit, and dried &s;alted fi&s;h, &amp;c. Of mo&s;t of the&s;e com|modities there is an immen&s;e con&s;umption through all this extent of country. Holland maintains, by
<PB N="84" REF="87">
her commerce, that of Frankfort, which is only a grand magazine &s;ubordinate to tho&s;e of Holland; &s;o that almo&s;t all the connexions, all the corre&s;pondence and commerce of that city, which extend them&s;elves far into Germany, are nothing but a commerce at &s;econd-hand, of which that of Holland is the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Dutch al&s;o furni&s;h a variety of different arti|cles to the Au&s;trian Provinces, particularly wine, Ea&s;t-India goods, and the produce of Italy and the Le|vant. The commerce of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Provinces is one of the mo&s;t advantageous branches of that of Holland. The admini&s;tration of the Au&s;trian Netherlands has made &s;everal efforts from time to time, for drawing their commerce out of the hands of the Dutch; but the&s;e attempts are yet too weak, for giving a &s;en&s;ible decrea&s;e to the Dutch trade: though they have laid heavy duties on the importation of herrings from Holland, and taken every precaution for having all the Spani&s;h wool that is wanted, imported at O&s;tend, which the manufactures of Verviers and Aix-la-chap|pelle draw at pre&s;ent from Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam.</P>
<P>Holland formerly carried on a very con&s;iderable trade with England; this has declined very much &s;ince 1651, the epoch of the act of navigation in England. The Dutch take of England tobacco, tin, woollen goods, jewels, hardware, corn, lead, &amp;c. from Scotland and Ireland &s;alt-beef and &s;almon, butter,
<PB N="85" REF="88">
tallow, hides, coals, &amp;c. This commerce is almo&s;t entirely in favour of England. The exports from Holland being nearly reduced to &s;pices.</P>
<P>The commerce of Holland with France has always been very con&s;iderable, and of great importance to both nations, particularly to the French; from the prodigious quantity of merchandize the Dutch draw out of that kingdom for their own u&s;e, and for ex|portation. It may al&s;o be truly &s;aid, that this com|merce is of great con&s;equence to the Dutch, not only for their home-con&s;umption, but by lo&s;ing this trade, they would lo&s;e the benefit of their exporta|tion to France; and in their importations, the bene|fit of their a&s;&s;ortments for the north, a branch of freight and navigation very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>The interior con&s;umption of Holland founded on luxury takes many commodities imported from France. For although economy reigns among the Dutch, the con&s;umption in their tables and their dre&s;s is infinitely increa&s;ed. And this importation from France fur|ni&s;hes a rich re-exportation. It was e&s;timated before the la&s;t war, that the returns from America to France, in &s;ugar, coffee, indigo, and cotton, amounted to be|tween &s;ix and &s;even millions &s;terling. Near hall tho&s;e commodities is &s;ent into Holland either on account of the Dutch, or to be &s;old on commi&s;&s;ion: all this rich part of the commerce of France is employed in
<PB N="86" REF="89">
re-exportation; for Holland draws from her own co|lonies as much as is nece&s;&s;ary for her own con&s;ump|tion in all the&s;e articles.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e importation from France is made entirely by Dutch &s;hips; thus, in leaving to the advantages of commerce, the uncertainty which ac|companies the re&s;ult of buying and &s;elling, we ought to calculate a very great &s;um, by which the riches of the republic are increa&s;ed, with a phy&s;ical certainty; that is in the freight, importation and exportation, the cu&s;toms, loading and unloading in the ports of Holland, the duties of &s;towage, &amp;c. and the commi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The French have made great efforts to get the trade of the north into their own hands. But this com|merce demands very con&s;iderable &s;ums to be advanced for a long time on very moderate profits, whil&s;t the intere&s;t paid for money in the commerce of France is always reckoned at &s;ix per cent. Few of the French merchants have funds &s;ufficient to wait the return for &s;o little profit: They are u&s;ed to trade on &s;mall capitals, and make their greater operations on their credit, rather than on their capital; but in the com|merce of the north, nothing can be done by credit, e&s;pecially in Ru&s;&s;ia, where they mu&s;t give a year's credit in &s;elling, and, in buying, pay a year before-hand, in order to trade to the be&s;t advantage. There
<PB N="87" REF="90">
are but few merchants in France able to &s;u&s;tain &s;o long a credit, &s;o as to do Holland any mi&s;chief by competition.</P>
<P>The Dutch have al&s;o a very great trade to Italy; it is a capital market for their merchandize of the Indies, of America, and of their fi&s;heries; and for almo&s;t all the merchandize which they import from Germany, and the north. This trade is principally carried on at the ports of Genoa, Leghorn, Venice, Naples and Me&s;&s;ina; the&s;e five places being the maga|zines of all the merchandize, which the re&s;t of Italy furni&s;hes to foreign countries, and of that which they receive in return.</P>
<P>Of the commerce of freight, tho&s;e of banking, commi&s;&s;ion, and in&s;urance, are the be&s;t branches of the Dutch trade, but particularly tho&s;e of freight and commi&s;&s;ion, which are always &s;ure, and accompanied with no ri&s;ks; but the&s;e branches have their &s;ource in the aggregate of all the other branches of commerce in the &s;tate, &s;o that their increa&s;e and decrea&s;e vary according as the general trade in the &s;tate is more or le&s;s flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Since the act of navigation in England, we may ob&s;erve a decrea&s;e in the commerce of Holland.&mdash; They are not the importers or exporters of our manu|factures to other countries.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">The Dutch Ea&s;t India company, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> is without exception the mo&s;t con&s;iderable trading e&s;ta|bli&s;hment that ever appeared in the world: The con|que&s;ts of the Portugue&s;e in the Indies were atchieved under the command and power of the crown, and were extended to an amazing degree; but with all the regal attention of the Portugue&s;e, they never equalled the dominion which the Dutch have gained under the direction of a private trading company.</P>
<P>We are not to wonder at the &s;uperiority of this company over all others; for &s;ucceeding to mo&s;t of the Portugue&s;e acqui&s;itions, on the downfal of their power in the Ea&s;t, they laid &s;uch a foundation of future power for them&s;elves, that no other company ever had &s;uch au&s;picious beginnings.</P>
<P>Their acqui&s;itions were &s;o exten&s;ive and &s;o very important, that the company found it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep up a very &s;tronge force by &s;ea and land in the Indies; this has given ri&s;e to the very mag|nificent de&s;criptions we have had of the great armies, navies, and &s;tate of the governor-general at Batavia: &s;ome of the&s;e circum&s;tances are exaggerated, but many of them appear to be true. The number of i&s;lands, &s;ome of them the large&s;t in the world, which are in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or in their power, make it nece&s;|&s;ary, that great fleets and con&s;iderable land-forces &s;hould be in readine&s;s at Batavia, and other &s;ettle|ments,
<PB N="89" REF="92">
in order to protect and defend &s;uch numerous coa&s;ts and countries.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other country in the Indies, this Ea&s;t India company has been long on the decline; this has been principally owing to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;o many others; the Engli&s;h have robbed them more than any other country. France had for a few years a company that flouri&s;hed &s;o much, as to prevent all importation from Holland, except &s;pices; and even exported a great quantity of ea&s;tern merchandize to Spain, Germany and Italy; Denmark and Sweden have between them &s;upplied their re&s;pective inhabitants; &s;o that the Dutch company has not the benefit of the markets &s;he once totally &s;upplied.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t age, there was no place comparable to Holland for numbers of flouri&s;hing manufactures. In the principal cities of the province of Holland, were found the fine&s;t and riche&s;t fabrics of all &s;orts of &s;tuffs; of &s;ilk, in every variation of gold, &s;ilver, &amp;c. of wool, and linen of all &s;orts; colours and dies, the fine&s;t and mo&s;t rare; ribbons and laces of gold, &s;ilver, and &s;ilk; velvets, gauzes, flowered, and plain, tape&s;tries; lea|thers gilt, &amp;c. All the&s;e manufactures exi&s;t at pre|&s;ent, but with le&s;s eclat than formerly; they are, e&s;pe|cially in tho&s;e of wool, &s;ilk, gold, and &s;ilver, rivalled by
<PB N="90" REF="93">
the competition of Genoa, Venice, France, and Eng|land.</P>
<P>The cloth manufactures of Leyden, and Utrecht, &s;upport their reputation; the &s;uperfines are as good and as fine as tho&s;e in foreign manufactures; and the blacks of Utrecht are always &s;uperior; the camlets of Leyden equal tho&s;e of Bru&s;&s;els. There is a difference between the&s;e fabrics and tho&s;e of France; <HI>Verviers</HI> and <HI>Aix-la-chapelle,</HI> of nine or ten per cent, which in foreign markets is an immen&s;e di&s;advantage to the ma|nufactures of Holland; this di&s;advantage to them is in common with tho&s;e in England, in the &s;ame kind of goods.</P>
<P>The manufactures of linen in the provinces of Gro|ningen, Frie&s;land and Overy&s;&s;el, are always equally &s;upported. The fabrics of France, Flanders, and Germany, make none that approach them. The linens which are called Dutch, are di&s;tingui&s;hed as much by the whitene&s;s, the finene&s;s, the grain, the equality, and the goodne&s;s, as by being mea&s;ured by the ell or manner of folding; the mo&s;t famous whiten|ing grounds in Europe, are at Haerlem; they give their linens the lu&s;tre and fine white, that di&s;tingui&s;hes them; they al&s;o enable the Dutch merchants to appro|priate to them&s;elves foreign manufactures, which they buy in We&s;tphalia, Flanders, and Brabant; and which being whitened at Haerlem, are produced in com|merce
<PB N="91" REF="94">
under the name of Dutch linens; for this whitening adds a new price to the linen, when it is of good fabric; they take care in this whitening, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any regulation, not to give the linens an artificial length, as is done in the whitening grounds of Flanders.</P>
<P>The manufactures of a paper are in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate; it is &s;urpri&s;ing they have been able to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves, &s;ince they have been multiplied &s;o much in France, and in the Au&s;trian provinces, where the price of labour is low, which is a great advantage in a manufacture that employs a great number of hands.</P>
<P>But the manufacture of all others the mo&s;t impor|tant, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary, is the con&s;truction of &s;hips. The timber-yard of the Admiralty and of the India Company are immen&s;e; but they are not comparable to tho&s;e of the village of Sardam, which <HI>Peter</HI> the Great cho&s;e as the fir&s;t &s;chool of Europe, for the con&s;truction of all &s;orts of naval buildings; and where he remained a long time un|known, in the quality of a &s;imple workman, for the in&s;truction of him&s;elf, and for rai&s;ing a marine in his va&s;t empire.</P>
<P>The manufacture of coloured linens and printed cottons, has lo&s;t prodigiou&s;ly its former advantages. They have been too much multiplied in countries where labour is at a low price, as in France, Switzer|land,
<PB N="92" REF="95">
and the Au&s;trian Low Countries. This is a com|petition, which it is impo&s;&s;ible Holland &s;hould &s;tand again&s;t.</P>
<P>The city of Am&s;terdam po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a manufacture which is &s;heltered from the effects of competition; at lea&s;t &s;he has only that of London to fear, who to the pre&s;ent time has been very weak in it; and that of Antwerp and London, is &s;carce any thing: it is the cutting of diamonds. Am&s;terdam is the only city that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in any very high degree of perfection, this art; and al&s;o that of reducing into &s;mall diamonds, tho&s;e large ones that are degraded by black &s;pots and flaws. This art is &s;upported by the merchants of Am&s;terdam, who give very much into the commerce of rough diamonds, both in the Ea&s;t Indies and Bra&s;il; by which they fix the art among them: for in|dependent of the diamonds brought from the Ea&s;t In|dies, they purcha&s;e the rough ones from London and Li&s;bon; and if a per&s;on buys rough diamonds in any other country, he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending them to Am&s;terdam to be cut; on her &s;ide Am&s;ter|dam has not much to fear, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> from the de&s;ertion of the workmen, who could not find work el&s;ewhere. This trade is an object, every year, of many millions of florins.</P>
<P>Book&s;elling was heretofore in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate; we &s;till &s;ee in Holland great fortunes, which
<PB N="93" REF="96">
have no other &s;ource but this branch of commerce; and the editions of <HI>Elzevir</HI> &s;hew, that the art of print|ing has been carried on there to the highe&s;t degree of perfection. This branch of commerce is at pre&s;ent very much fallen; it neverthele&s;s maintains a great number of printing-hou&s;es, e&s;pecially at Am&s;terdam, Leyden, and the Hague; and a foundry of characters at Haerlem, which is renowned, and merits its re|putation.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority gained by the book&s;ellers of France, has re&s;trained tho&s;e of Holland very much. The Dutch book&s;ellers have many di&s;advantages. Paper is dearer than in France, and they have fewer oppor|tunities of procuring good manu&s;cripts than the French book&s;ellers; they are likewi&s;e more liable to receive prejudices from counterfeit editions. The re|cour&s;e of this trade in Holland, is in the fairs of Leip&s;ic, of which books make the principal riches. Leip&s;ic is an immen&s;e magazine of books: all the book&s;ellers in Europe trade there in per&s;on, or by commi&s;&s;ion, if we except tho&s;e of France and England, who having a great con&s;umption, attend little to the commerce at Leip&s;ic; book&s;ellers there, &s;ometimes get a &s;ale for intire editions; they make exchanges and many &s;ales, for which they get credit from one fair to another, that is to &s;ay for &s;ix months. There is perhaps no branch of commerce which is executed in a manner &s;o &s;imple, &s;o ea&s;y, and with &s;o much good faith.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">But before we quit the &s;ubject of Dutch com|merce, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that there are two ideas re&s;pecting it in England, both of which are erroneous. Some per&s;ons imagine that the commerce of the Dutch is &s;unk to &s;uch a degree, that her decline is &s;wift, and foretels at no very di&s;tant period, the de&s;olution of the &s;tate, or at lea&s;t its &s;ubjection to &s;ome neighbouring power; others, on the contrary, who have heated their imagination with the ideas of the great commerce they once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, will not readily allow the declen&s;ion it has experienced; but con&s;ider the republic equal in wealth and power, to what it was the beginning of the la&s;t century. Few per&s;ons make due allowances for changes, nor will they willingly &s;teer a mean cour&s;e, when extremes are &s;o much more dazzling and brilliant. The truth is, the Dutch &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s a very con&s;iderable commerce; it is however much inferior to that of England. Within the&s;e la&s;t thirty years, the trade of England has increa&s;ed very much, and that of Holland has been on the decline; the other powers of Europe have likewi&s;e increa&s;ed their commerce; France indeed, has not, except in a few branches; but the Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Ru&s;&s;ians, are all very much ad|vanced in their trade, and at the expence of the Dutch: were this quite general, the Dutch common|wealth would &s;oon &s;ink into inanity. This declen&s;ion of commerce has not altogether ari&s;en from the ri&s;e in the manufactures; but from the &s;pirit in every
<PB N="95" REF="98">
country of &s;upplying it&s;elf. When kingdoms and &s;tates are bent upon becoming trading nations, they do not enquire into the prices of labour in Holland, but take every mea&s;ure for &s;upplying them&s;elves with tho&s;e manufactures and products, formerly taken of foreigners.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e general cau&s;es which have, and &s;till continue, to operate towards the decline of the Dutch commerce; that nation is in the exclu|&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome branches, which will continue them in a great trade, whatever oppo&s;ition they may meet with. Fir&s;t, the &s;pice-trade, which is totally theirs, without any competition, and amounts to be|tween one and two millions &s;terling <HI>per annum.</HI> This is the only in&s;tance of a monopoly we meet with in the world. Spice is generally &s;old all over the world, and yet the profits of an ab&s;olute and complete monopoly do not amount to two millions a year; &s;ome writers value it at no more than one million. Monopolies have in their very vitals, the principles of decay; prices mu&s;t and ever will be &s;o rai&s;ed, that the con&s;umption will generally decline, and the va&s;t expence of pre|&s;erving it will reduce the profit to a much &s;maller &s;um than could have been imagined.</P>
<P>The herring-fi&s;hery is another mo&s;t important article, of which the Dutch have &s;o great a &s;hare, that it not only brings in immen&s;e &s;ums to the republic, but al&s;o breeds
<PB N="96" REF="99">
them an infinite number of excellent &s;ailors; and the &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to the whale fi&s;hery, in which they carry on a great trade.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Charles</HI> V. was emperor of Germany, he was king of Spain, and &s;overeign of the Low Countries, not only of the United Provinces, but of the ten others; tho&s;e now known by the names of Au&s;trian Brabant, and French Flanders; and retiring from his &s;o|vereignty, not only the empire, but the&s;e countries devolved on his &s;on <HI>Philip</HI> II. who was married to <HI>Mary</HI> of England. This monarch, being a Spaniard by birth, and having a great deal of the haughtine&s;s of that nation in his compo&s;ition, endeavoured to govern them by laws and maxims, entirely Spani&s;h, employed none but Spaniards in his councils; quitted the Low Countries to re&s;ide in Spain; continued the Spani&s;h and Italian forces in pay, and in&s;i&s;ted on &s;upplies to maintain them. Thus he &s;oon lo&s;t the affection of his Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects; and thinking it beneath him to attend to the grievances and di&s;contents of &s;o incon&s;iderable a people, or to be limited by their ancient forms of government, it creat|ed in them &s;uch a di&s;like to his per&s;on and admini&s;tra|tion, as made them ripe for a revolt. But the wor&s;t of

<PB N="97" REF="101">
all, was his introducing a &s;pecies of inqui&s;ition which the &s;pirit of the Flemings could not brook; ju&s;t having adopted the prote&s;tant doctrines: determining therefore to get rid of the tyranny of this prince, aggravated by his appointing the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> governor; a man in his nature, a much greater tyrant than his ma&s;ter; they aro&s;e one and all in oppo&s;ition to his mea&s;ures; placing the prince of <HI>Orange</HI> at their head, and meeting with &s;uccour from France and England by &s;ea, &s;ome of the&s;e provinces, now the United States of Holland, carried their point, and became independent of Spain. This was in the year 1579; the only misfortune they had, was the death of their hero and protector the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who in the year 1584, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his palace at Delft, by <HI>Balthazar Gerhard,</HI> a Burgun|dian; he &s;hot him with a pi&s;tol as he was going down the &s;tairs to his carriage. The other ten provinces re|mained with the duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to whom <HI>Philip</HI> gave them, as a marriage portion, with his daughter <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> By the treaty of Vienna, 1725, &s;even provinces were annexed to the German Empire, and the other three by exchange, in 1748, were ve&s;ted in France.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the cities in Holland are con&s;tituted on a plan &s;omewhat &s;imilar to Am&s;terdam, and governed by a regency, &s;ending deputies to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates; which deputies are obliged to vote in that a&s;&s;embly, according to the in&s;tructions given them by the regency. As the members of the regency
<PB N="98" REF="102">
hold their places for life, and likewi&s;e elect each other, it plainly marks the government of the re|public to be ari&s;tocratical. It is not, however, true that they always hold their places for life; there be|ing in&s;tances of their being removed. Sometimes al|terations have been made in ca&s;es of gro&s;s mi&s;con|duct; &s;ometimes by the Stadtholder, in pur&s;uance of the unanimous re&s;olution of the provincial &s;tate; and &s;ometimes, as in the unhappy di&s;turbances which took place in Holland about four years &s;ince, by an arm|ed force, which a&s;&s;embled tumultuou&s;ly for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>And it was by this means that the Stadtholder was deprived of &s;ome of his functions in the &s;tate, and driven from the republic. The majority of the lower cla&s;s of people in Holland have always been &s;trongly attached to the Stadtholder's party. It is chiefly the higher cla&s;s of traders, with their adherents, which compo&s;ed the party of patriots. The&s;e people, who in their &s;phere of life corre&s;pond with many of our ju&s;tices in the counties round London, and con|&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons who have acquired wealthy fortunes by commerce, when once they can become members of the regency in any town in Holland, would, if there was no Stadtholder, acquire a patronage and con&s;equence equal to that of our fir&s;t nobility, which makes all men of this de&s;cription in the pro|vince of Holland very aver&s;e to the office of Stadt|holder.
<PB N="99" REF="103">
In the other provinces where the people chu&s;e the regents, the oppo&s;ition to the Stadtholder is very incon&s;iderable. The body of the people who are then the electors, being very much attached to that office.</P>
<P>By a late regulation which has taken place in the Dutch government, on account of the la&s;t di&s;turb|ances, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> has a power of mak|ing &s;uch alterations as he may think proper, in the mode of electing the regencies of tho&s;e cities in the province of Holland, which &s;ends deputies to the &s;tates-general. That is, the regents in&s;tead of being elected by each other &s;hall be cho&s;en by the burghers, which was the ancient cu&s;tom, and which &s;eems much more rational and ju&s;t. This regulation has taken place in con&s;equence of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march|ing a large army into Holland, to demand reparation for the affront offered to his &s;i&s;ter, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was &s;topped in her journey to the Hague, where &s;he was going to mediate between her hu&s;band and the &s;tates-general, during the time of his being &s;u&s;pended, and very indignantly treated, and kept pri&s;oner &s;everal days, by the per&s;ons who &s;topped her in her journey. The &s;tates at fir&s;t at|tempted to ju&s;tify the conduct of their officers in this bu&s;ine&s;s, as a matter which the circum&s;tances of the times rendered expedient; but the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> marching to the gates of Am&s;terdam, after having
<PB N="100" REF="104">
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Utrecht, which the patriots deem|ed their &s;trong fort, and which was evacuated without the firing of a gun; the regency of Am&s;terdam and the &s;tates of Holland, who were the principal fomen|ters of the di&s;turbances, thought proper to lower in their demands, and con&s;ent to the &s;atisfaction requir|ed, which was, that the &s;enators, in the different cities, who had been the principal in&s;truments in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;hould be depo&s;ed, and the Prince's friends re|&s;tored to their offices in the &s;tate; and further, that a committee of the &s;tate &s;hould wait on the Prince&s;s to apologize for the indignities that had been offered to her. In con&s;equence of which, the Prince's friends being re&s;tored to their offices in the &s;tate, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> re-a&s;&s;umed his function, and things now continue to go on in their former channel.</P>
<P>Thus much &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, before we enter upon the government of the United Provinces, which aro&s;e to &s;uch grandeur in the cour&s;e of fifty years, as to rival the mo&s;t formidable powers in Europe, and even to di&s;pute the dominion of the &s;ea with England, who had rai&s;ed them from ob&s;curity, and enabled them to engro&s;s almo&s;t every valuable branch of commerce.</P>
<P>We will now proceed to their government. The United Provinces are a confederacy of many inde|pendent &s;tates; for not only every province is &s;ove|reign
<PB N="101" REF="105">
and independent of any other power; but there are, in each province, &s;everal le&s;&s;er republics, independent of each other, which are not bound by the degrees of the &s;tates of the province till &s;uch acts are ratified by each particular city or republic, which &s;ends deputies to the provincial a&s;&s;embly. The &s;everal republics according to the ancient rank &s;tands thus: Gelderland, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Frie&s;|land, Overy&s;&s;el, and the city and territory of Gro|ningen; and the country of Drenthe is al&s;o under their protection. The collective body of deputies of the United Provinces, who are inve&s;ted with the conduct of public affairs, bear the title of the A&s;&s;em|bly of the States-General of the United Provinces. Affairs of daily occurrence, or little moment, and &s;uch as admit of no delay, are determined by them without their being particularly empowered to do &s;o, or even &s;o much as previou&s;ly acquainting the pro|vinces; but in matters of importance they are obliged to refer to their re&s;pective provinces for in&s;tructions how to proceed.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> relates, that during his emba&s;&s;y in Holland, he had the good fortune to prevail with the States-general to ratify their treaties within the &s;pace of five days, without pa&s;&s;ing the e&s;&s;ential forms of their government, in having recour&s;e to the provinces, who mu&s;t likewi&s;e have had the con&s;ent of the &s;everal ci|ties. And he a&s;&s;ures us, that the deputies by con|cluding
<PB N="102" REF="106">
the&s;e alliances without commi&s;&s;ion from their principals might have lo&s;t their heads, if the treaties had not been approved. But the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing this expedition being apparent, they were &s;o far from being cen&s;ured, that they even gained great applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The deputies of Holland are allowed by their pro|vinces after the rate of four florins a-day, and tho&s;e of the other &s;tates, &s;ix. The place where this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly is held, is the palace of the old Counts of Holland at the Hague. Each province may &s;end what number of deputies it plea&s;es, the charge attend|ing it being its own; but all together are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only of one vote, the number of votes being always equal to that of the provinces, that is to &s;ay &s;even. But notwith&s;tanding this, the number of deputies &s;ent frequently amounts to forty or fifty. In this a&s;&s;em|bly of the States-general no ceremonials of precedence are ob&s;erved, every province alternately &s;ucceeding to the pre&s;ident&s;hip in its week. They &s;it al&s;o through|out the whole year, without adjournment. The Stadt|holder may come into their a&s;&s;embly to lay before them any overtures on public concerns, but he has no &s;eat in it.</P>
<P>Their power too is &s;o far limited, that without the unanimous con&s;ent of all the provinces, they neither make war nor peace, levy troops, impo&s;e taxes, or conclude alliances with foreign powers; and if they
<PB N="103" REF="107">
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the legi&s;lative authority, the laws they enact are only binding in tho&s;e provinces that gave their con&s;ent to them. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e limitations, the power of the States-general is &s;till very con&s;iderable: war and peace is made in their name, and it is they that &s;end and receive amba&s;&s;adors and other foreign mini&s;ters. The commander in chief for the time being, and other military officers take an oath of fidelity to them, and in war-time, &s;ome of their members or of the council of &s;tate, follow the army, &s;it in the council of war, and &s;o far repre&s;ent the uni|ted Maje&s;ty of the &s;even provinces, that, without their con&s;ent nothing of any importance can be under|taken. In time of war, the &s;tates likewi&s;e grant li|cences and protections, lay duties on goods imported or exported, and pardon de&s;erters. The States al&s;o confer divers commi&s;&s;ions on the members of their a&s;|&s;emblies. The title a&s;&s;umed by them is that of <HI>Hogen mogen,</HI> high and mighty Lords, and in public ad|dre&s;&s;es, they are &s;tyled their High Mightine&s;&s;es.&mdash; Their arms are ruby, a lion rampart holding in one paw a &s;word, and in the other a bundle of &s;even arrows; beneath the &s;hield, which is &s;urmounted with a ducal coronet, is the following motto, <HI>Concordia res parvae cre&s;cunt.</HI> Concord makes &s;mall things great.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of Holland are compo&s;ed of the de|puties of the nobility, and of eighteen cities, or great towns, making in all, nineteen voices, of which the nobility and gentry have only one.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="108">The nobility who are not numerous in Holland, being &s;uch as were created before they became a republic, are called <HI>Graafs,</HI> or Counts: they are repre&s;ented in the provincial &s;tate by eight or nine of their own number, and when one of them dies, they elect another to &s;uccced him; but the&s;e altogether have only one voice, equal to the &s;malle&s;t of the abovemen|tioned towns. They are very con&s;iderable, however, in the government, as they po&s;&s;e&s;s many of the be&s;t po&s;ts both civil and military; and as they vote fir&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly, they influence the towns very much, who give their voices afterwards. The&s;e nobles are called the Eque&s;trian Order.</P>
<P>The grand pen&s;ioner of Holland, who &s;its with them, delivers their vote and a&s;&s;i&s;ts in all their de|liberations, previous to the general a&s;&s;embly. He is always a per&s;on of great credit, and &s;eldom removed, though, by their con&s;titution, he ought not to remain in that po&s;t more than five years. His place is be|hind all the deputies, or repre&s;entatives; being, in fact, but the &s;ervant of the province, though he frequently influences the re&s;t of the deputies, for he propo&s;es all matters that are to be debated by the &s;tates, collects their opinions, and dige&s;ts their re&s;olutions, like the &s;peaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons in England, and &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umes a power of delaying and po&s;tponing the mo&s;t important affairs, though a majority of the
<PB N="105" REF="109">
a&s;&s;embly are for the que&s;tion, pretending it will be of bad con&s;equence to the province.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entatives of the cities are elected from the magi&s;tracy and &s;enate of each town, and their num|ber is more or le&s;s, according to the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e they repre&s;ent, though they have all but one voice, and are paid by the towns who &s;end them.</P>
<P>The council of &s;tate, the admiralty, and the trea|&s;ury, are &s;ubordinate to the States-general, and very nearly re&s;emble the &s;ame councils e&s;tabli&s;hed when the&s;e provinces were &s;ubject to their &s;everal princes, or united under the hou&s;es of Burgundy or Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The Stadtholder&s;hip, which was originally elective, was in 1747 made hereditary in the hou&s;e of Orange, and like the crown of England, to de&s;cend to the fe|male line, in default of male i&s;&s;ue. Many per&s;ons were of opinion that it would be politic to offer the &s;overeignty of the United Provinces to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but he cho&s;e rather to decline it. The high and indelible obligations which the Dutch owe to <HI>Wil|liam</HI> the Great, and the renowned patrioti&s;m and fide|lity of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Orange through every &s;ucceeding generation, have ever thrown the choice on this family, as a kind of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their having made the Stadtholder|&s;hip hereditary in the family of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="110">
the people of Am&s;terdam, and of the province of Holland in general, the lowe&s;t cla&s;s excepted, are by no means reconciled to that high po&s;t being made perpetual and hereditary in the republic; they con|ceive a Stadtholder to be an office nece&s;&s;ary only in time of war, or when the country is threatened with an inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The office of Stadtholder is not a barren title de&s;|titute of any emoluments; on the contrary, he has wherewithal to &s;upport a very brilliant court.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to find out exactly what his ap|pointments amount to. The prince is paid by every province for being Stadtholder; he is paid for being captain-general. He pre&s;ides in the councils of &s;tate, at the head of the different admiralties, and in all the courts of ju&s;tice, except in the grand council of Holland: and he is paid for part of the&s;e honorary pre&s;idencies; for example, as pre&s;ident of the council of &s;tate, he receives twenty-five thou&s;and florins; he is likewi&s;e paid for being governor of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India companies. He is grand fore&s;ter of &s;ome of the provinces, which forms a tribunal and &s;eparate judicature in each province, and this charge is not without &s;ome advantage: the amount of all the&s;e different charges is very difficult to be a&s;certained; but it is in general computed at three hundred thou|&s;and florins, or nearly fifteen thou&s;and pounds a-year.
<PB N="107" REF="111">
In time of war they mount much higher. He is fur|ther intitled to a tenth of the prizes taken in war|time, which he has generou&s;ly given up to be divided among the &s;hip's crew. To the&s;e con&s;iderable ap|pointments, he adds an immen&s;e patrimony, which renders him the riche&s;t prince in Europe.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Stadtholder has a court equal to that of the mo&s;t &s;overeign prince; he however, confor|mable to the characteri&s;tic of the nation, takes very little &s;tate upon him; he con&s;tantly attends the pa|rade every morning; and if any foreigner or reputa|ble merchant is introduced to him, will take him by the hand, and invite him to dine with him. The prince has the command of all their forces, by &s;ea and land; as admiral and captain-general, he has in con&s;equence the di&s;po&s;al of all military commands. The con&s;titution has likewi&s;e inve&s;ted him with the power of pardoning criminals; and it is a&s;&s;erted, that when there is no Stadtholder, that indulgence is not ve&s;ted in the States-general. The &s;oldiers are like|wi&s;e obliged to take an oath of fidelity to him after having taken one to the States; but the Stadtholder has no power of rai&s;ing troops but by their order. Previous to <HI>Cardinal Richlieu</HI>'s time, the Stadt|holders had only the title of Excellency given them. It was he who fir&s;t ordered the French mini&s;ter, at the Hague, to addre&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with the title of Highne&s;s, in order to carry &s;ome favourite
<PB N="108" REF="112">
point; which title has been continued to every &s;uc|ceeding prince, as well by the Dutch as by foreigners.</P>
<P>It is a common ob&s;ervation, that if the ancient &s;overeigns of the&s;e countries had impo&s;ed half the taxes the people groan under at pre&s;ent, they would never have borne it, but now their governors con&s;i&s;t|ing of the principal men in every great town and province, have &s;uch an influence over the whole, that it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility for the common people to form them&s;elves into a body, &s;o as to en|danger the &s;tate. Their &s;overeigns are always on the &s;pot, and &s;hould the mob prevail in one city or pro|vince, if they do not meet with the like &s;ucce&s;s in the re&s;t of the provinces, they mu&s;t expect to be very &s;oon reduced to &s;ubjection. So that a re|bellion, or what others denominate a noble &s;truggle for their liberties, is almo&s;t impracticable by the &s;ub|jects of Holland, be their oppre&s;&s;ion ever &s;o great. Holland being indeed a country which depends en|tirely upon trade, navigation, and manufactures, and in all which their governors are &s;ome way or other intere&s;ted, they mu&s;t naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to pro|mote them to the utmo&s;t of their power; con&s;equent|ly, that part of its &s;ubjects which is concerned in the&s;e, which it mu&s;t be admitted are by far the greater number, is &s;ure to meet with all manner of en|couragement.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="113">If we con&s;ider a government of &s;o complex a nature as that of the United Provinces, in which &s;uch a variety of intere&s;ts and inclinations is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it in full force and efficacy; we &s;hall wonder how it has la&s;ted &s;o long, rather than be &s;urprized that of late years it has tottered, and been in danger of &s;ubver&s;ion. It is no mean entertain|ment to trace this republic to its origin. Hi&s;torians &s;eem to agree, that the people of which it is com|po&s;ed, &s;o early as the Roman time, when the com|mon-wealth gave laws to great part of the world, were, in the highe&s;t degree, impatient of any encroach|ments on their liberty. The vigilance, &s;obriety and indu&s;try of the Dutch, &s;upported their revolt again&s;t the crown of Spain, and after many years &s;pent in laborious trials of their own con&s;tancy, they formed at length that plan of government which now exi&s;ts. How long it will la&s;t, is hard to &s;ay; the foundation of it does not appear very &s;table. A hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand. Whil&s;t the&s;e people are not agreed concerning their fir&s;t magi&s;trate, they will never inve&s;t him with power &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the various exigencies to which the &s;tate is &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It &s;eems evident from their late conduct, from the pre&s;ent condition of that &s;tate, and from the nature of their con&s;titution, that they are in no happy or &s;ecure &s;ituation. Hence they require the help of a fir&s;t magi&s;trate, who&s;e power, though limited, &s;hall be
<PB N="110" REF="114">
&s;ufficient to &s;upport him as the umpire of all their in|terior conte&s;ts, and who by a proper direction of their &s;trength, may re&s;tore them to a real independency.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> remarks, more than a century ago, that the Dutch had pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of their trade; and from the events of the la&s;t fifty years, nothing is more evident than the declen&s;ion of their power. In the middle of the la&s;t century they were a match at &s;ea for the combined fleets of France and England; but in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive war, their navy was much &s;unk; and in that of 1741, their maritime force was not to be compared to that of England. At pre|&s;ent it is quite &s;unk, if we con&s;ider it as a navy, which, when put in competition with that of England, was called a maritime power. That they have a fleet, can|not be denied, but their &s;hips are very few in number, in bad order, and &s;carcely have they any force ready for real &s;ervice; &s;o we may &s;afely &s;peak of it as an annihi|lated marine. It is true, they have a great number of &s;ailors, but the&s;e alone do not con&s;titute a force at &s;ea: &s;hips regularly built in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and kept in excellent order, &s;tores, magazines, yards, docks, timber, and an hundred other articles, all different from what trade employs, are nece&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t be kept regu|larly, or a powerful fleet will never be con&s;tituted. The marine of England co&s;ts an immen&s;e annual &s;um, and yet the be&s;t judges of it a&s;&s;ert, we are much
<PB N="111" REF="115">
too &s;paring of our expences on that head; but in Holland the expence of the navy is &s;o retrenched and curtailed, that it is hardly an object in the finances.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their laws, tho&s;e learned civilians <HI>Grotius, Noodt, Huber, Vinnius,</HI> &amp;c. have done their utmo&s;t to improve upon the ancient civil laws of nations. The pre&s;ident <HI>Schorer</HI> took a wi&s;er cour&s;e, he has proved that the Roman laws, which are the ba&s;is of the civil laws of tho&s;e provinces, have no con|nection with the phy&s;ical and moral circum&s;tances, the manners, habits, commerce, and character of the people of the pre&s;ent day. Yet there is le&s;s rea&s;on to complain here of the Roman law, than of the forms which the lawyers oblige their clients to undergo, and which incur expences and delays to which there is no end. The judges here decide very impartially, and as far as the weakne&s;s of human under&s;tanding will permit, with great integrity. Be|&s;ides the Roman law, they place great confidence in the light of rea&s;on, ju&s;ter far than all written laws; they al&s;o follow the municipal laws of the towns and provinces, and the ordinances of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Although it is no &s;mall &s;um that is requi&s;ite to de|fend a cau&s;e in any of the different courts of ju&s;tice, yet there is a very good regulation. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who are poor, can obtain from the judges the privi|lege
<PB N="112" REF="116">
of pleading for nothing, and the younge&s;t advo|cate is generally pitched upon to plead their cau&s;e. But what renders this in&s;titution &s;till more commen|dable, is that this privilege extends to &s;trangers as well as to natives.</P>
<P>The &s;heriffs are the ordinary judges of the inhabi|tants; an appeal lyes from their &s;entence to the courts of ju&s;tice, e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of the pro|vince. And although the decrees of the&s;e latter are without appeal, yet by an addre&s;s to the &s;tates of the province, a revi&s;ion of their decrees may be obtained, which is done by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed under the authority of the &s;tates for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The criminal code of the&s;e provinces is very &s;evere. The party accu&s;ed, whether guilty or innocent, un|dergoes two examinations, one called the ordinary, and the other the extraordinary; except the accu&s;ed be immediately convicted and own his guilt, the extra|ordinary one takes place.</P>
<P>The grand bailiff, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to pro&s;ecute, que&s;tions the pri&s;oner in the pre&s;ence of the magi|&s;trates. If there are &s;trong proofs of guilt, and he re|fu&s;es to confe&s;s, the judges order the preparatory que&s;|tion, which is commonly put in their pre&s;ence. When a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt has been forced from the pri&s;o|ner by torturing him, the definitive que&s;tion is put to
<PB N="113" REF="117">
him, which the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him men|tions. But if he will make no confe&s;&s;ion, notwith|&s;tanding his being tortured, his trial continues, but he cannot be put to death. When the trial goes on in the u&s;ual manner, both parties plead one again&s;t the other, according to forms pre&s;cribed by the &s;tate. The pri&s;oner's cau&s;e is pleaded by an advocate; and it is by &s;uch cau&s;es as the&s;e that the young lawyers ri&s;e into fame. The judges hear both parties, examine the evidence, and determine accordingly. This trial may be re-heard in any of the &s;uperior tribunals, at the reque&s;t of the per&s;on convicted; but then it mu&s;t be done at his expence, being looked upon only as a civil action, though death may be the re&s;ult of the verdict; yet this is a &s;entence very &s;eldom pronounced. The judges are very much inclined to &s;hew lenity, and al|ways mitigate the puni&s;hment where the criminal has not been guilty of murder. If the criminals are rob|bers or coiners, again&s;t which the law has decreed the puni&s;hment of death; they are expo&s;ed on a gallows with a rope about their neck, and whipped or mark|ed, and then confined for life, or for a limited time; which puni&s;hment the Burgoma&s;ters often remit, when they vi&s;it the pri&s;ons.</P>
<P>By the laws of the country, no per&s;on can be im|pri&s;oned but one again&s;t whom &s;ome crime has been alledged; as &s;oon as convicted, impri&s;onment cea&s;es; whipping, bani&s;hment, or branding, are the only pu|ni&s;hments
<PB N="114" REF="118">
that can be inflicted; yet the judges are not &s;uppo&s;ed to tran&s;gre&s;s this law, when they doom a per&s;on to perpetual impri&s;onment, who&s;e crimes me|rited death: as in the&s;e ca&s;es, impri&s;onment is a fa|vour which the judges are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;hew a cri|minal.</P>
<P>The pri&s;ons where the&s;e criminals are confined, are called ra&s;p-hou&s;es, which are noticed under the arti|cle of Am&s;terdam; they are there employed in &s;awing Brazil wood, if they have &s;trength; if not, they are put to &s;ome other work. The ordinary ta&s;k is to &s;aw three hundred pounds of wood a-week; the &s;aws are taken away from the pri&s;oners every evening, le&s;t they &s;hould do &s;ome mi&s;chief with them. By a privilege granted to the hou&s;es of correction, no per&s;on is allowed to have this wood &s;awed el&s;ewhere on his own account.</P>
<P>What is very &s;ingular, if a per&s;on is attacked by another who endeavours to murder him, it is not per|mitted here for the per&s;on &s;o attacked to kill the other, though in his own defence; except he has behind him a wall or canal which he cannot &s;wim over, or &s;ome other ob&s;tacle which prevents making his e&s;cape. Some years &s;ince, an officer was beheaded at the Hague by this very law, having killed another in his own de|fence, who had fir&s;t attacked him, with an intent to murder him.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="119">Notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the laws again&s;t mur|derers, the common weapon of attack in Holland is a large pointed ca&s;e-knife, called a &s;nicker-&s;nee, which the lower cla&s;s of people carry about with them, and u&s;e as familiarly in the &s;kirmi&s;hes with each other, as the common people in England do their fi&s;ts. Having however learned the art of handling the&s;e weapons, in which, as in all others, there con&s;i&s;ts a &s;cience; it is very rare that they kill one another. There is how|ever a very &s;evere penalty denounced again&s;t any one who makes an a&s;&s;ault on another with the&s;e weapons, though it is &s;eldom inforced with that rigour which &s;uch a law &s;eems to demand.</P>
<P>No citizen can be taken up or impri&s;oned for any trivial crime, on giving bail to the &s;heriff. The high bailiff cannot even oblige any citizen to appear before him, without &s;ending a formal &s;ummons, much le&s;s can he impri&s;on him without leave of the Burgoma&s;ters, except it be for &s;ome very heinous offence; &s;uch as murder, &s;etting fire to a hou&s;e, or the like, and even then there are certain forms which he mu&s;t comply with. To take up a citizen, he mu&s;t go him&s;elf, with two or three other magi&s;trates, to his hou&s;e. A citi|zen's habitation is a &s;acred a&s;ylum, which cannot be violated under pretence of making any &s;earch. The officers of ju&s;tice have only the privilege of entering taverns and public-hou&s;es. A citizen mu&s;t be &s;um|moned three times before he is obliged to appear.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120">For a very trifling &s;um any per&s;on whatever, may purcha&s;e the right of a citizen; he likewi&s;e acquires it, by being married to the widow and daughter of one. A man however enjoys none of the privileges of a citizen, till he has been made one a twelvemonth; and even then he mu&s;t have occupied or had an apartment du|ring that time, in the city where he in&s;cribed his name. It is &s;trictly &s;peaking, only the &s;on of a new-made citi|zen, who can be elected into the magi&s;tracy, which opens a door to &s;trangers for their children; they &s;eldom however get elected, except they ally them|&s;elves with &s;ome of the principal families in the magi|&s;tracy.</P>
<P>There is an old cu&s;tom in Holland, which had its ri&s;e &s;o long ago, as during the time when the Dutch were &s;haking off the Spani&s;h yoke, and which is con|tinued to the pre&s;ent time, though the nece&s;&s;ity of it no longer remains; and this is, that the magi&s;trates are authori&s;ed by a particular law to &s;end away &s;u&s;|pected inhabitants without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on, or ever allowing them to be heard in their own defence. The &s;tates, however, have decreed that &s;uch a right &s;hall only be exerci&s;ed in ca&s;es of great emergency; and have even offered to receive any petition on that head; but having no power to act further than as mediators, not arbitrators, the bani&s;hed citizen &s;till remains expo&s;ed to the envy and malignity of the per&s;on who had pro&s;ecuted him. This abu&s;ive
<PB N="117" REF="121">
privilege does not extend to all the provinces; it is more particularly in Holland, where its baneful in|fluence is felt.</P>
<P>The laws re&s;pecting bankrupts bear &s;ome analogy to tho&s;e of our own; and from the great facility with which traders in Holland get relieved from their in|cumbrances, it is &s;aid, there are many people in that country, who&s;e object in &s;etting out in trade, is to em|bezzle their creditors effects, and then make their for|tune, by declaring them&s;elves bankrupts. When a per&s;on cannot pay his debts in Holland, he carries an inventory of his effects, with the &s;tate of his affairs, to certain commi&s;&s;ioners, delegated by the magi&s;trates, to examine and arrange all the concerns re&s;pecting bankrupts. There, as in England, the le&s;&s;er number is obliged to follow the greater. Three-fourths of the creditors, and two-thirds of the debt; or three-fourths of the debt, and two-thirds of the creditors, are required to make a man a bankrupt. A failure being declared, the debtor has &s;ix weeks allowed him to arrange his affairs, after which time he mu&s;t keep at home, if he will not run the ri&s;k of being arre&s;ted. Though a per&s;on &s;hould have contracted. debts in different countries, yet he becomes liable to them in Holland; but the difficulty of recovering them increa&s;es in proportion to the di&s;tance, provided the debts have not been contracted by bills of ex|change. The expences which a per&s;on mu&s;t make

him&s;elf liable to, before he can arre&s;t a citizen, are very con&s;iderable, and are &s;till much more &s;o, if the creditor &s;hould live at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance. When a per&s;on fails in Holland, if there is no &s;ur|mi&s;e of fraud, it is &s;aid to be cu&s;tomary for the &s;tates to allow a certain &s;um to the bankrupt, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in launching out again in the world; and that without intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The amount to which taxes are carried in Holland, forms a very remarkable criterion of government. Are we to e&s;teem the countries where taxes are low as the mo&s;t free and happy; or tho&s;e where they are the highe&s;t? It is amazing that this que&s;tion cannot be an&s;wered in the manner which the fir&s;t con&s;ideration of it dictates; which is, that the lower the taxes are, the more free and happy are the people. But this is not all; taxes run higher in &s;ome of the free &s;tates of Europe, than in any of the ab&s;olute monarchies: of this, Holland is a &s;trong in&s;tance; for in that country a given number of people pay double what the &s;ame number of people u&s;ed to do in France; and in Eng|land, though the people are not &s;o high taxed as in Holland, yet they pay more than they u&s;ed to do in France; this &s;hews evidently that taxes are not incon|&s;i&s;tent with liberty: and yet arbitrary power is not able to &s;queeze out of the people, &s;o much as a free government gets with ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="123">The imports in Holland are divided into three ca|pital branches; the duties upon exportation and im|portation; and the duties on valuation, which under that denomination is not a u&s;ele&s;s title, but an ad|ditional duty upon exportation and importation. This is the fir&s;t branch of taxes, and the only one which is paid alike by all the inhabitants of the &s;even provinces; and this import is laid on by the direct order of the States-general, and its produce carried into the trea&s;ury belonging to the republic. The two other principal branches con&s;i&s;t in duties upon weights in the provinces and cities; in duties upon con&s;ump|tion, and in others per&s;onal and real. The whole of the&s;e taxes are e&s;timated at 120 million of florins. The manner in which the taxes are collected, renders them liable to great fraud; but whenever it is di&s;co|vered, there are very heavy puni&s;hments inflicted, of fine, impri&s;onment, and corporal cha&s;ti&s;ement. Hol|land is perhaps the only country in which a traveller can go in and come out, and not be mole&s;ted by tho&s;e harpies of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, who exerci&s;e their power with &s;uch tyranny in other &s;tates. The ex|pences in collecting the taxes are &s;o great, that they con&s;ume nearly half of what is collected.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the duty on merchandi&s;e imported or export|ed, almo&s;t every article of home-con&s;umption pays an exci&s;e to the amount, in many of them, of one third of their value, &s;uch as bread, beer, wine, turf; e&s;pecially
<PB N="120" REF="124">
in the province of Holland; &s;ervants, hor&s;es, coaches, chai&s;es; plea&s;ure-yachts pay taxes, as well as fruits; and there is likewi&s;e a tax on horned cattle.</P>
<P>Every family pays a &s;um of money in proportion to their circum&s;tances, even for the privilege of drinking tea, or coffee. The proprietors of e&s;tates and hou&s;es likewi&s;e pay an annual tax for them, according to their &s;uppo&s;ed value, which generally amounts to two and an half per cent. When the &s;tate is pre&s;&s;ed for mo|ney, this tax is doubled, and &s;ometimes trebled, which becomes very burthen&s;ome to the renters. All pub|lic &s;ales, legacies, collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, as well as tho&s;e in a right line, are &s;ubject to a tax of from five to thirty per cent. Marriages and funerals likewi&s;e pay a very heavy duty, in proportion to the opulence of the parties to be wedded or interred; the&s;e two taxes &s;eem very curiou&s;ly regulated. When the parties pre|&s;ent them&s;elves for marriage, which in this country takes place before a civil magi&s;trate, a tariff is pre|&s;ented to them, con&s;i&s;ting of a number of columns of different cla&s;&s;es of riches; in which every per&s;on is free to &s;et their name down in what column they think proper, and the tax is proportionate to the property which they rate them&s;elves worth.</P>
<P>The tax on funerals is upon a &s;imilar &s;cale. Tho&s;e who are interred before two o'clock in the afternoon, pay &s;carce any duty; but after that hour has &s;truck,
<PB N="121" REF="125">
there is a duty of 25 florins; at half pa&s;t two, it amounts to 50 florins; if the time exceeds three o'clock before the corp&s;e is brought to be interred, it is 100 florins; at half pa&s;t three, 200 florins; and &s;o it continues augmenting proportionably every half hour. It is u&s;ual likewi&s;e to pay the bearers of the corp&s;e from thirty &s;ous to fourteen florins each, ac|cording to the rank of the per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e taxes, as well as tho&s;e on lands, hou&s;es, car|riages, public &s;ales, legacies, &amp;c. are very proper ob|jects of taxation, as they do not attack the indu&s;try of the people; they fall only upon wealth and &s;uperfluity, and might be imitated with great advantage by the other nations of Europe.</P>
<P>But with regard to the exci&s;e laid on the con&s;ump|tion of nece&s;&s;aries, though it is le&s;s burthen&s;ome in the commercial cities than el&s;ewhere; it is neverthele&s;s very de&s;tructive, e&s;pecially in cities, where the com|merce con&s;i&s;ts of buying and &s;elling. The&s;e exci&s;es evidently render the nece&s;&s;aries of life much dearer to the people, and con&s;equently increa&s;e the prices of la|bour; and from thence another bad con&s;equence ari&s;es, that all the works required in the navigation and &s;hipping become dear; and the maintenance of the crews likewi&s;e in proportion dearer, by which the nation lo&s;es the advantage of a low freight.

<P>AND fir&s;t with re&s;pect to the army, which though perhaps of le&s;s importance to the &s;tate than their navy, has in mo&s;t countries the precedence. The Dutch &s;tand in need of a con&s;iderable military force for their defence, notwith&s;tanding which, it has not hitherto been put on a proper e&s;tabli&s;hment. Every province keeps on foot as many &s;oldiers as it can conveniently maintain; but the Swi&s;s regiments are paid by the States-general. In times of peace, the forces of the republic &s;eldom exceed 40,000 men, and their number is very often le&s;s. On the peace of We&s;tphalia, in 1648, the army was reduced to thirty thou&s;and; in 1713, it was 40,000; and in 1717, thirty-two thou&s;and. After the treaty of Aix-la-chapelle in
<PB N="123" REF="127">
1748, the reduction was made gradually; fir&s;t, the greate&s;t part of the hired troops were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, then the new rai&s;ed regiments. The number of men in each company of the national, Scotch, and Swi&s;s re|giments was al&s;o con&s;iderably reduced. In 1752, &s;ome further reductions were introduced, which made the &s;tanding army very low; but in lieu thereof, a better di&s;cipline was introduced among the troops. Perhaps the time may come, when it &s;hall be perceived, adds <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> of how little &s;ervice new rai&s;ed regiments are, and how detrimental it is to a &s;tate to di&s;band veteran troops, how great &s;oever may be the &s;avings it is attended with.</P>
<P>In time of war, the republic takes into its pay &s;ome of the regiments belonging to the German princes. The chief command of the army is ve&s;ted in the Stadtholder, as captain-general; but the executive part, particularly in war-time, is filled by the field mar&s;hal general. The expences attending the military e&s;tab|li&s;hment amount to about ten millions of guilders annually.</P>
<P>The pay of a common &s;oldier in the Dutch &s;ervice, is four &s;tivers, or four pence &s;terling a-day, cloaths deducted, for which one &s;tiver is taken off; &s;o that their full pay is three &s;hillings a-week, or thirty-five &s;tivers, with &s;ome &s;mall allowance of bread. The captains are likewi&s;e allowed twelve hundred florins
<PB N="124" REF="128">
a-year, for cloathing their company, with which they are obliged to furni&s;h their men with a new &s;uit of cloaths every year. The uniform of the Dutch regiments is blue, &s;imilar to that of the Pru&s;&s;ians, with this diffe|rence, that the cloth in the Dutch regiments is of a quality &s;uperior to that with which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;oldiers are clad. The &s;erjeants of the guards have &s;ilver-laced regimentals. The Dutch are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the He&s;&s;ians and Swi&s;s by white breeches. They make a fine figure on the parade, their hair being dre&s;&s;ed very neat, in the manner of the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, and their cloaths not quite &s;o &s;hort. They perform their exerci&s;e with great exactne&s;s, and are examined every fourth day, in order to &s;ee if their arms are kept in proper order, and little faults are puni&s;hed in the ranks by a certain number of blows on the back with the major's cane; they wheel out of the rank on their heel at the word of command to receive the puni&s;hment, and then wheel into the rank again. The invalids have pen&s;ions nearly equal to the half pay of a private &s;oldier in England; amounting to 84 florins a-year. The Dutch &s;eldom puni&s;h any of their &s;oldiers with death; de&s;ertion in this country, different from all other &s;tates, being only puni&s;hed by making the de&s;erter work on &s;ome of the public works. It &s;hould be mentioned however that there is no other country that pays their troops &s;o liberally as the Dutch; &s;o that a &s;oldier is &s;ure not to benefit him&s;elf by de&s;ert|ing from this &s;ervice to enter into any other. There
<PB N="125" REF="129">
are three Scotch regiments in the Dutch &s;ervice, mo&s;t of the officers of which are from Scotland. In our late war with the Dutch, they were incorporated with the national regiments.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers of the States-general cannot be quar|tered in any of the cities belonging to the different provinces without their permi&s;&s;ion, which was the chief rea&s;on of their lo&s;ing &s;o many towns in the French inva&s;ion of 1672; for while the magi&s;trates of the different cities were deliberating whether they &s;hould receive the &s;oldiers under the orders of the States-general, the French took advantage of their di&s;&s;en|tions, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;ome very important places, without the delay of a formal &s;iege. The forces of the republic are, for the mo&s;t part, quar|tered in the conquered country, or what is called the <HI>Generalit&eacute;</HI> lands, and not in any of the &s;even provinces, except at the Hague. Mo&s;t of the capital cities in the Dutch Netherlands have re&s;pective militias of their own. Am&s;terdam, in particular, has a body of two or three thou&s;and troops in its pay, who regularly mount guard, and to whom the defence of the city is intru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The naval force of the republic made formerly a great figure, and in &s;ome of their wars the Dutch have had no le&s;s than an hundred &s;ail of the line in commi&s;&s;ion; but the u&s;ual number kept up in time of peace is not
<PB N="126" REF="130">
more than thirty; and tho&s;e are not always properly equipped for &s;ervice. It is however very certain that the different admiralties can, in a very &s;hort time, equip fifty or &s;ixty &s;ail of the line. The &s;hips in commi&s;&s;ion, in time of peace, are generally employed to cruize in the Mediterranean, in order to protect their trade again&s;t the cor&s;airs, or el&s;e as convoys to the home|ward bound Ea&s;t-Indiamen.</P>
<P>The admiralty colleges, which from the heavy charges attending the employing &s;o many clerks and other &s;uperior officers, corre&s;ponding with our lords of the admiralty, are looked on as a burthen to the &s;tate; provide for the &s;afety of the &s;ea and rivers, and likewi&s;e for the &s;hipping in general; equip men of war, and appoint convoys for merchant-&s;hips. The number and rank of the&s;e colleges, are as follows: Fir&s;t, the college of Rotterdam; &s;econdly, that of Am&s;terdam; thirdly, that of Zealand or Middleburg; fourthly, that of We&s;t Frie&s;land or North Holland, and, la&s;tly, that of Frie&s;land. Each of the&s;e colleges extends to that part of the navy a&s;&s;igned to it, and the&s;e &s;everal expenditures gave ri&s;e more particularly to the duties on exportation, which are accordingly levied by the admiralty colleges. In time of war, and in ca&s;es of extraordinary naval equipments, heavier duties are laid on the &s;everal imports and exports, as likewi&s;e on all &s;hips coming in or going out of the different ports, exclu&s;ive of large contributions from
<PB N="127" REF="131">
every province. The Stadtholder of the United Netherlands is likewi&s;e high admiral of the naval force of the republic. He &s;its al&s;o as pre&s;ident in the ad|miralty colleges, and &s;ometimes even i&s;&s;ues orders for the conduct of the fleet or particular &s;hips. When a fleet is fitted out for &s;ea, the vice-admiral, general, or any other commanding officer, u&s;ually divides it into the van, center, and rear.</P>
<P>The deputies of the different colleges have 1000 florins a-year appointment, be&s;ides their apartments; and when they are in employ, an additional four florins a-day, be&s;ides the expences of their journies to and from the different &s;ea-ports.</P>
<P>When the States-general have re&s;olved to equip a &s;leet, the council of &s;tate &s;ends orders to the different colleges to fit out their re&s;pective quota of &s;hips. If the different colleges of admiralty have not wherewithal to fit out a fleet, the re&s;pective pro|vinces make good the deficiency, or give the admiralty leave to borrow the &s;um that is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is incumbent on the &s;everal colleges to a&s;&s;ign the complement of men requi&s;ite for each &s;hip, after which the captain u&s;es his utmo&s;t diligence to procure as good hands as po&s;&s;ible to man them, and undertakes to provide provi&s;ions and all other nece&s;|&s;aries for his &s;hip's crew. The college for this al|lows
<PB N="128" REF="132">
him a fixed &s;um per day for each man. This occa&s;ions great emulation among the captains, and is one of the be&s;t means po&s;&s;ible to get a &s;hip well and &s;peedily manned. There is not a &s;et of people who fare harder than the &s;ubaltern officers in the Dutch navy, &s;uch as lieutenants, &amp;c. their appoint+ments are very &s;lender, and they have no more than the ratios of two forema&s;t men. The lieutenants of men-of-war in the Dutch &s;ervice are appointed by the different colleges, according to a plurality of voices.</P>
<P>In time of war, the States-general give permi&s;&s;ion to their &s;ubjects to fit out armed &s;hips, to crui&s;e again&s;t the enemy; but they mu&s;t be&s;ides have a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion either from &s;ome of the admiralty col|leges, or from the States, otherwi&s;e they are con&s;idered as pirates.</P>
<P>The neglect of their marine is a mo&s;t impolitic conduct in the Dutch; for a trading power to rely more on its land-forces than on its navy, is &s;uch an in&s;atuation, that nothing but a very favourable com|plexion of affairs among its neighbours, can prevent extreme ill con&s;equences from en&s;uing. The Dutch army has generally proved in&s;ufficient for their defence, in a land-war, whereas their fleet have more than once brought them off in triumph, and concluded their quarrels to their advantage.</P>

<P>AT the time of the reformation, the inhabitants of the United Provinces declared for Lutherani&s;m, adhering only to the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion; but in 1562 a different &s;y&s;tem of articles, corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e of Geneva, was drawn up for the Netherland churches. And in 1583, the States of the United Pro|vinces unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the Calvini&s;t doc|trine alone &s;hould be &s;upported, without tolerating the exerci&s;e of any other religion; but the la&s;t clau&s;e never obtained the force of a law. In 1571, the Calvini&s;t doctrine, as &s;et forth by the &s;ynod of Dort, received the &s;anction of the &s;tates of each province, notwith&s;tanding which, the Jews are more numerous than the Chri&s;tians; who, agreeable to that rational maxim of dominion over the con&s;cience belonging to God alone, enjoy liberty of con&s;cience and the free exerci&s;e of their religion; provided they do not oppo&s;e that of the &s;tate, and attempt to di&s;charge &s;ub|jects from their obedience to the civil power. The Calvini&s;ts alone, however, are admitted to any &s;hare in the government. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons here con&s;i&s;t of four orders; of pro&s;e&s;&s;ors of divinity at the
<PB N="130" REF="134">
univer&s;ities, of beneficed mini&s;ters, of elders, and dea|cons. All matters re&s;pecting religion are canva&s;&s;ed in different a&s;&s;emblies, called con&s;i&s;tories, cla&s;&s;es, and &s;ynods. In every pari&s;h there is a con&s;i&s;tory, com|po&s;ed of the mini&s;ters, elders, and deacons, in which are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all matters more particularly relating to that pari&s;h. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved here, that the pari&s;hes in Holland are not like tho&s;e in England, comprehending a &s;mall di&s;trict with only one mini&s;ter, but there are &s;everal belonging to one church. The cla&s;&s;es are meetings &s;imilar to our archdeacon's vi&s;ita|tion. The &s;ynods &s;eem to have great affinity with our hou&s;es of convocation.</P>
<P>In the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government there is no dignity or rank higher than that of mini&s;ter of a pari&s;h. The mini&s;ters are likewi&s;e independent of each other. They have no other di&s;tinction among them than that of longe&s;t &s;tanding. When they have been mini&s;ters &s;ixty years, they are generally declared approved; and pre&s;erve their appointments during life, though they no longer perform the duties of their office, Their large&s;t &s;tipends do not amount, according to &s;ome writers, to more than two thou&s;and florins, or about a hundred pounds a year, others make them a hundred and fifty; this &s;alary is paid them by the magi&s;trates. As to tythes and church-lands, the &s;tates took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e when they fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed their independence, and have retained them ever &s;ince;
<PB N="131" REF="135">
&s;o that the Dutch clergy depend entirely on their magi&s;trates; and if they di&s;approve the doctrines of their mini&s;ter, or di&s;like his preaching, it is &s;aid, as a &s;ignal to get rid of him, they &s;end him a pair of &s;hoes and a &s;taff, by which he is to under&s;tand that it is their plea&s;ure he &s;hould quit their territories: and he is not permitted to offer any exculpation of him&s;elf. None of the clergy in Holland are permitted, as with us, to hold a plurality of benefices. The profe&s;&s;ors are indeed allowed the privilege of having church preferment. The widows of the clergy likewi&s;e enjoy a pen&s;ion for their life, be&s;ides one year of their hu&s;band's &s;tipend.</P>
<P>To be elected a mini&s;ter or clergyman in the Dutch church, it is nece&s;&s;ary to undergo two examinations in one of the&s;e &s;ynods. The fir&s;t is, to obtain that rank in their church which corre&s;ponds with that of deacon of England; and which gives an authority to preach, but not to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments. When there is a vacancy in any church, the con|&s;i&s;tory de&s;ires permi&s;&s;ion of the province or city to which it belongs to appoint another mini&s;ter. They then proceed to the election of one, in the &s;ame man|ner as the fellows of colleges in our univer&s;ities fill up their vacant fellow&s;hips, by plurality of voices. This election of a new mini&s;ter by the con&s;i&s;tory mu&s;t afterwards be approved by the magi&s;trates of the town or di&s;trict, or el&s;e the con&s;i&s;tory mu&s;t be obliged to proceed to a fre&s;h election.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">The duties of a pari&s;h prie&s;t in Holland are &s;imilar to tho&s;e in England, except that in Holland they are forced to preach two or three times a-week. The minutiae of their functions are more attended to in Holland, &s;uch as catechi&s;ing in their churches, exami|ning into the lives and characters of their pari&s;hioners, and vi&s;iting their &s;ick.</P>
<P>The elders in Holland are per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by their years, their morals, and rank in life, who are elected generally from among the magi&s;trates, to in|&s;pect into the affairs of the church, and vi&s;it the different pari&s;hes. They are removable every two years.</P>
<P>The deacons are elected and removable in like manner. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to collect and di&s;tribute the charities to the poor. The collections for the poor are made by them while the mini&s;ter is preaching, at which time they go round the church with a pur&s;e, and a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> fa&s;tened to the end of a &s;taff, in order to make contributions. And what is very &s;ingular, all tho&s;e places of wor&s;hip which are not of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, are obliged to give part of the money they collect for their own poor, to the poor of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Perhaps there is no country in the world where there is &s;o much money collected in charity, as in Holland. Every city and every &s;ect has its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment apart, where both the old and the young
<PB N="133" REF="137">
are received and taken care of. The revenue of the abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and convents, which were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed at the reformation, have ever &s;ince been employed for this purpo&s;e. In &s;ome cities they likewi&s;e levy particular taxes for the&s;e in&s;titutions. No children are received in any of the&s;e charities above fifteen years old. They have ma&s;ters who teach them to read and write, and they are afterwards in&s;tructed in &s;ome branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The old people admittde into the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be fifty years old. Each in&s;titution has its different rules and cu&s;toms. In many of the&s;e charities they are ad|mitted without any expence. In others a &s;um of money is previou&s;ly required.</P>
<P>The Dutch churches are &s;eldom without organs, and no part of their &s;ervice &s;eems to delight them &s;o much as &s;inging p&s;alms. The p&s;alms to be &s;ung in the cour&s;e of the &s;ervice, are u&s;ually written down on &s;lates hung up in different parts of the church. The Dutch are not very &s;trict in their ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath, after the duties of the day are over; but will follow their recreations in the evening more than the Pre&s;byterians in this country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their marriages, before they take place in Holland, there is a &s;olemn contract made between the parties in pre&s;ence of their friends, by which their choice is &s;o far determined that there is
<PB N="134" REF="138">
no receding from it; and after this ceremony has been gone through, they make no &s;cruple of living together as man and wife, and the woman is frequently preg|nant before the marriage has been &s;olemnized in a church. There are in &s;ome towns commi&s;&s;aries cho&s;en from the principal citizens, who take down the names of the per&s;ons who wi&s;h to be married, in order to &s;ee if they have the con&s;ent of their friends; after which they deliver the names of tho&s;e who are to be married, to the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, if approved, who publi&s;hes the banns three times in the church, before or after &s;ermon, according to the cu&s;tom of the place. It is &s;aid, if a parent or guardian refu&s;es his con&s;ent, without ju&s;t cau&s;e being &s;hewn, that the commi&s;&s;aries will not only permit the marriage to take place, but al&s;o oblige the parents or guardians to ad|vance a &s;um &s;ufficient for the maintenance, or &s;etting up in bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch per&s;ons, according to their &s;tation in life and circum&s;tances. As for tho&s;e who are not of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, it is the cu&s;tom to pub|li&s;h their banns before the town hall, in the pre&s;ence of two &s;enators, though this is &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ed with, and their marriages are &s;uffered to be &s;olemnized when the banns have been publi&s;hed in their re&s;pec|tive places of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Though the Dutch women in their bloom are very hand&s;ome, yet applying them&s;elves after marriage to all &s;orts of drudgery, their beauty u&s;ually goes off by

five-and-twenty. If the hu&s;band be a trade&s;man, his wife manages every thing in the &s;hop, and her man, as &s;he calls her hu&s;band, has very little to do within doors, and can &s;carce indeed be called ma&s;ter of his family. His very children in&s;ult him, e&s;pecially if favourites of his wife, and from his &s;ervants he has but little re&s;pect.</P>
<P>At the burials of the Calvini&s;ts there is no funeral &s;ervice read, nor any bell rung to give notice of the interment. In &s;ome places both men and women attend their friends to the grave, in others, the women are prohibited. The time of mourning for a parent, a hu&s;band, or a wife, is a year and &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>The Catholics and Lutherans in Holland lay great &s;tre&s;s in tolling a bell at the death and burial of their friends, and having them interred in con&s;ecrated ground for which the government makes them pay very dear. Indeed, there are no rites, how &s;uper&s;titious &s;oever, the Dutch will not tolerate, if they are paid for it.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholic churches in the United Provin|ces are about three hundred and fifty, and the pro|portion of them is &s;till greater in the <HI>Generalit&eacute;</HI> lands. The Papi&s;ts in this country are admitted to military employment; but no per&s;on of that &s;ect, is ever created field mar&s;hall. They are computed at one-third of the inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="140">The Lutherans are likewi&s;e permitted the free ex|erci&s;e of their religion in the towns; and their places of wor&s;hip, in the external appearance, look like churches; but an edict of 1655 prohibits them from having any churches in the country, though in &s;ome p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aces they are connived at. They are, however, ren|dered incapable of all po&s;ts and employments.</P>
<P>The Quakers, at pre&s;ent, in this country are dwindled to a very &s;mall number; but the Moravians form a very con&s;iderable body of people. The American Chri&s;tians likewi&s;e enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion. The many other &s;ects, which have no &s;ettled congregations, we pa&s;s over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The Jews have been permitted the public exerci&s;e of their religion, ever &s;ince the year 1619, and have many privileges in common with the re&s;t of the inha|bitants, except, that they are excluded from mo&s;t trades. It is u&s;ual to divide them into Portugue&s;e and Germans, the former of whom came from Portugal in great numbers in 1530, and 1550, and were very kindly received here.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tate of learning in Holland, it cannot be expected that a nation &s;o ab&s;orbed in commerce as the Dutch, &s;hould be&s;tow much time or attention on works of literature. This country has, notwith&s;tanding, pro|duced eminent men in the commonwealth of learning.
<PB N="137" REF="141">
&s;uch as <HI>Grotius, Spino&s;a, Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> who was afterwards canon of Wind&s;or, <HI>Van Swieten, Meur&s;ius, Era&s;mus, Helvetius,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> who is &s;aid to have acquired above two millions of florins by his profe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides the above-mentioned illu&s;trious literary characters who were born in the country, there have been many other eminent men invited there, who have made it their place of re&s;idence. There are no le&s;s than five univer&s;ities in the United Provinces, Leyden, Utrecht, Harderwyck, Franecker, and Groningen; with two Gymna&s;iums, one at Am&s;terdam, and another at Deventer; be&s;ides &s;everal grammar-&s;chools of note; and in Haerlem, there is an academy of &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Dutch writers are generally cen&s;ured for an in|temperance of learning. Mo&s;t of them load their writings with &s;uch numerous extracts and quotations, that if any per&s;on was to &s;elect the original ideas of the author, there would probably often be found not more than a few lines in a large volume.</P>
<P>Extracts are certainly u&s;eful in works of juri&s;pru|dence and medicine, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader, and enable him to have recour&s;e to authors from whom they are taken. But in the belles-lettres they only &s;erve to load the &s;entences, and to divert the attention of the reader from the original idea. It is in the&s;e provinces that politics have been mo&s;t learnedly treated of. The mo&s;t eminent civilians have been Dutchmen, or
<PB N="138" REF="142">
&s;uch as have been invited from other countries to pre&s;ide in their &s;eats of learning. The ornamental parts of learning have never been cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s. They have neither poets nor orators. At lea&s;t they have none that would be e&s;teemed as &s;uch in other countries.</P>
<P>In the fine arts, the Dutch have chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in painting and engraving, though they are not without &s;kilful &s;tatuaries. Their &s;chool of painting, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> de&s;erves to be viewed, in order to have an idea of the height to which the mechani&s;m of the art may be carried. Their fini&s;h is much more perfect than that of the Italians. But as they only &s;ervilely copy an ungraceful nature, one of their pictures never makes us wi&s;h to &s;ee it again. Their ab&s;urd want of ta&s;te makes them de&s;pi&s;e all that be|long to the Italian &s;chool. The antique with them is a term of ridicule. And if an arti&s;t were to work there on tho&s;e ideas, he would die with hunger.</P>
<P><HI>Rubens,</HI> to whom nature by mi&s;take gave birth in their neighbourhood, is not reli&s;hed by the Dutch, and the proof of it is that no young painter imitates him. If they value his pictures, it is becau&s;e they &s;ell well: and if &s;ome of his pictures &s;till remain among them it is becau&s;e travellers will not give &s;ix times more for them than they are worth.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143">The languages of the United Provinces is a dialect of the High German, but more corrupt and clowni&s;h. The people of fa&s;hion u&s;ually &s;peak French. Their Lord's prayer runs thus: <HI>On&s;e Vader, die in de hemel nzyn: uwen naam worde gehey light: uw'koningkryk kome; uwe wille ge&s;chid&egrave; gelyek in den hemmel zoo ook op den arden, ons dagelicks broot geef ons heeden, ende vergeeft on&s;e &s;chulden gelyk ook wy vergeeven on&s;e &s;chaldenaaren: ende in leid ons niel in ver&s;oekinge maer verlo&s;t on van den boo&s;en.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P>THIS empire con&s;i&s;ts of European, A&s;iatic, and African po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and is thought to be the large&s;t in the world. Some affirm it is 2,000 miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and 1,750 from north to &s;outh. Turkey in Europe is divided by the moun+tains of the Ca&s;tagnas into north and &s;outh.</P>
<P>It was part of the ancient Chri&s;tian empire of the ea&s;t, and is bounded on the ea&s;t by Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and A&s;ia; on the north by Croatia, Sclavonia, and Tran&s;ylvania; on the we&s;t by the gulf of Venice; and on the &s;outh by the Mediterranean &s;ea. This part of Turkey comprehends ancient Greece, to the &s;outh, in which are &s;even large provinces, Albania,

Epirus, Macedonia, Janna or The&s;&s;aly, Livadia, the Morea, and the i&s;lands of the Archipelago. The northern part contains Walachia, Moldavia, Be&s;&s;arabia, Croatia, Bo&s;nia, Dalmatia, Servia, Bulgaria, and Ro|mania or Romelia, formerly Thrace. Turkey in A&s;ia comprehends five large parts, Natolia, Georgia, Turcomania, Diarbeck, Suri&s;tan and Syria; &s;ome writers reckon Arabia and Armenia; but the&s;e coun|tries are almo&s;t wholly independent of the Grand Signor. In Africa they po&s;&s;e&s;s Egypt, and a &s;mall part of Aby&s;&s;inia and Barbary. There are al&s;o other countries in A&s;ia and Europe, which they are not ma&s;ters of alone, but conjunctly with other princes.</P>
<P>It is proper, in this place, to add, likewi&s;e, the nations who are or were allied in a particular manner to the Porte, without being entirely &s;ubject to it. The&s;e are the Tartars of the Crimea and the cantons of Barbary. The Precopite Tartars, inhabitants of the Cher&s;on|ne&s;us, now called the Crimea, or Little Tartary, and who are likewi&s;e called Nogayan Tartars, are a people dependent on the Ottoman Porte; but they rather de&s;erve the title of allies, &s;avs <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> for there exi&s;ts between them and the Porte a reciprocal convention, that if the male line of the Ottoman emperors fails, the Khan of Crimea &s;hall &s;ucceed to the empire, and in the &s;ame manner the Ottoman monarch &s;hall inherit the Crimea. This convention was the cau&s;e of that &s;trict union which has always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
<PB N="142" REF="147">
them. The Grand Signor does not treat de&s;potically with them as he does with his other &s;ubjects, and as he had in former times begun to do even with them. When he &s;ends any order to the Khan, he does not make u&s;e of a <HI>Firman</HI> or ab&s;olute mandate, but written letters, expre&s;&s;ing his will and plea&s;ure, which, how|ever, are always complied with.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e people are not under any obligation to pay tribute, they very often &s;end pre&s;ents to the Sultan and the Grand Vizier. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Crimea is very different to what it was &s;ome years ago: for in the la&s;t war between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians, the latter conquered the whole country. At the peace, however, every thing was nearly re&s;tored to its former &s;tate. A principal article of the peace was the independence of the Crimea, and the free election of the Khans. But of the two chief candi|dates on the death of the reigning Khan, one was partially &s;upported by the Porte, of which the Ru&s;|&s;ians complained, as an infraction of the article of independence. The memorials of the court of Peter&s;|burgh were not li&s;tened to; upon which the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;upported vigorou&s;ly the party of the other competitor, who&s;e name is <HI>Sahib Guerai.</HI> The enemies of <HI>Guerai</HI> were overpowered, he was elected Khan, and Ru&s;&s;ia actually reigned in the prince &s;he had protected. All the fortre&s;&s;es were in the power of the Ru&s;&s;ians, Caffa, the principal town in the Crimea, not excepted; the
<PB N="143" REF="148">
Black &s;ea is full of Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els, and every effort of the Turks to drive them out has been ineffectual.</P>
<P>The country comprized under the name of Little Tartary, contains be&s;ides the Crimea, the Cuban, a part of Circa&s;&s;ia, and all the lands which &s;eparate the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia from the Black &s;ea. In this latter di&s;trict lyes the important fortre&s;s of Oczakow, at the influx of the Dnieper, into the Black &s;ea, which was lately taken from the Turks by the Ru&s;&s;ians, and which the empre&s;s &s;tipulated to be ceded to her as the ba&s;is of a treaty of peace concluded with the Turks, together with the territory &s;urrounding it, from the Bog to the Dnie&s;ter; inhabited, but only in the vallies and by the &s;ides of the rivers, by the Tar|tars, called Nogayan Tartars, and &s;ubject to the Khan of the Crimea. The&s;e Tartars are even more nume|rous than tho&s;e in the Crimea. This country is like|wi&s;e &s;ometimes called Oczakow Tartary. But of the&s;e countries we &s;hall afterwards &s;peak more fully.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli are almo&s;t on the &s;ame footing with the Porte as the Crimea. The&s;e barbarians often receive orders from the Porte, which they do not attend to, when they cla&s;h with the re&s;pective intere&s;ts of each &s;tate. They are, however, obliged to join the Ottoman fleet with all their mari|time forces in time of war. The &s;ame compact obliges the Porte to &s;upport them with all its forces again&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="149">
any enemy who &s;hall attack them. They do not pay any tribute, but &s;end pre&s;ents every three years, like the Crim Tartars, to the Grand Signor, and he, in return, &s;ends them &s;ome armed &s;loops and frigates pro|perly equipped for &s;ea, except being manned. The&s;e &s;tates, therefore, are more properly con&s;idered as allies than &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The Turks are of Tartarian or Scythian extraction. This appellation having been fir&s;t given them, in the middle ages, as a proper name, it being a general title of honour to all the nations comprehended under the two principal branches of Tartar and Mongul: nor do even the Turks appropriate it peculiarly to them|&s;elves, both the Monguls and the Tartars, properly &s;o called, e&s;teeming it a mark of honour due to them; the word <HI>Tur,</HI> as an adjective, meaning &s;ublime and pre-eminent, and as an appellation, a governor. <HI>Turci,</HI> therefore, may import both the governor of a hord (<HI>Ki</HI> among the Tartars &s;ignifying a hord or company) as well as the hord it&s;elf. The Scythian or Tartarian nation, to which, as we have before ob&s;erved, the name of Turks has been peculiarly given, dwelt between the Black and Ca&s;pian &s;eas, and became fir&s;t known in the &s;eventh century, when <HI>Heraclius,</HI> emperor of the Ea&s;t, took them into his &s;ervice, under whom they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves &s;o much, that the Ara|bian and Saracen caliphs not only had particular bodies of them for their guards, but their armies
<PB N="145" REF="150">
were likewi&s;e filled with them. Thus they gradually got the power into their own hands, and &s;et up and dethroned caliphs at their plea&s;ure. This happened about the ninth century. By this &s;trict union of the Turks with the Saracens or Arabs, the former were brought to embrace the Mahometan religion; &s;o that they are now become intermixed, and have jointly extended their conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now enter into a detail of Turkey in Europe. Nature has ble&s;&s;ed the inhabitants of Tur|key beyond mea&s;ure. Its &s;oil is luxuriant without dre&s;&s;ing. Its air is &s;alubrious. The &s;ea&s;ons are regu|lar and plea&s;ant, and the waters are &s;o pure and de|lightful, as to invite them to frequent bathings in all parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> in her de&s;cription of the beautiful climate of this country, that every thing in nature which has remarkable advantages attending it, &s;hould likewi&s;e have certain di&s;advantages to counterbalance them, &s;o as to reduce the portion of happine&s;s to a level for mankind. This beautiful enchanting country, the climate, the objects, the &s;itua|tion of it, make an earthly paradi&s;e; but the plague&mdash; the earthquakes&mdash;&s;ubjects that would make the rational part of mankind fly it for ever, render it terrifying to every mind. If things and per&s;ons may be com|pared, is it not like a beautiful woman, hand&s;omer than
<PB N="146" REF="151">
mo&s;t of her &s;ex, with accompli&s;hments equal to her beauty, whom the world, her very inmates envy, but yet whom the ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that &s;urround her communicate a horror to her be&s;t admirers, and frighten them from her bewitching charms?</P>
<P>Though the air of Turkey is &s;o very healthy in it&s;elf, pe&s;tilence is brought there from Egypt, and has more than once &s;wept away one fifth of the inhabitants of Con&s;tantinople; yet from the prevalence of cu&s;tom, and the Turki&s;h doctrine of fatality, they give them|&s;elves very little concern about it.</P>
<P>The provinces, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> are univer&s;ally fruit|ful, though with &s;ome difference, in&s;omuch that both agriculture and graziery turn to great profit in this country. Great quantities of excellent grain and fruits are exported every year into foreign &s;tates; but of this we &s;hall &s;peak more at large in the &s;eparate de&s;cription of each country. All the nece&s;&s;aries of life are equally good and cheap in Turkey.</P>
<P>The mountains in the different countries of this empire, are the mo&s;t celebrated of any in the world, and many of them at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t fruitful, Mount Athos lyes on a penin&s;ula, running into the AEgean &s;ea; the mountains Pindus and Olympus cele|brated in Grecian fable, &s;eparate The&s;&s;aly from Epirus. Parna&s;&s;us, &s;o famous for being con&s;ecrated to the
<PB N="147" REF="152">
mu&s;es, is well known. Mount Hemus is likewi&s;e often mentioned by the poets; but mo&s;t of the other mountains have changed their names; &s;uch as the mountains Suha, Wito&s;ka, Staras, Plamina, and many others. Even the mo&s;t celebrated mountains above-mentioned have had modern names given them by the barbarians in their neighbourhood. But of the&s;e mountains we &s;hall treat more particularly when we come to the re&s;pective countries in which they are &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The principal &s;eas in this quarter of the globe are the Black &s;ea; the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> or &s;ea of A&s;oph; the &s;ea of Marmora, which &s;eparates Europe from A&s;ia; the Archipelago, and the Ionian &s;ea. The Black &s;ea, formerly called the Euxine &s;ea, lyes between Europe and A&s;ia; it is bounded on the north by Tartary; on the ea&s;t, by Mingrelia, Circa&s;&s;ia, and Georgia; on the &s;outh by Natolia; and on the we&s;t by Romania, Bulgaria, and Be&s;&s;arabia; thus reaching from the Crimea to within twenty miles of Con&s;tantinople, to which and the White &s;ea, it is joined by a very narrow &s;trait. It is about 150 miles acro&s;s from the Crimea, but wider in &s;ome places, and 780 miles in length, and has &s;ome good harbours; and &s;everal currents, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the Danube, Bori&s;thenes, Tanais, and &s;everal other le&s;s con&s;iderable rivers which throw them&s;elves into it, run quite acro&s;s it. The&s;e currents occa&s;ion &s;hips to be to&s;&s;ed backwards and forwards, and often|times,
<PB N="148" REF="153">
by the violence of the &s;torms, to be da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks.</P>
<P>About the mouth of the Euxine &s;ea, where the pa&s;|&s;age is narrowe&s;t, about twenty miles from Con&s;tanti|nople, lyes a rock in the &s;hape of an i&s;land, about fifty or &s;ixty yards from the &s;hore. Here formerly &s;tood a pillar of white marble, called Pompey's pillar, be|cau&s;e, according to the received opinion, <HI>Pompey</HI> erected it after he had conquered <HI>Mithridates,</HI> as a la&s;ting memorial of his victory. Near this rock are &s;everal le&s;&s;er rocks, of which the ancients have related &s;uch a number of fabulous &s;tories, a&s;&s;erting they floated on the water, at the mouth of the Bo&s;phorus. Near the&s;e rocks, the &s;ea appears to be black all round the horizon. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had that name given to it by the Turks, from its being very dangerous to &s;ail acro&s;s. The Turks call the &s;ea <HI>Mauro-thala&s;&s;a.</HI> The Turki&s;h word <HI>Mauro</HI> &s;ignifies, likewi&s;e, &s;ad and lamentable, as well as black. Per|haps al&s;o it may receive its name from the black clouds, which ri&s;e up here more frequently than in other places; for the waters of this &s;ea are not blacker than tho&s;e of any other. But violent &s;torms very often come on &s;o &s;uddenly, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be guarded again&s;t them, and the&s;e will &s;ometimes ri&s;e up in&s;tantaneou&s;ly in the fine&s;t weather. Lady <HI>C.</HI> who traver&s;ed this &s;ea from the Crimea to Con&s;tanti|nople, relates, that there is a large rock on the Euro|pean
<PB N="149" REF="154">
&s;hore, near the &s;pot on which Pompey's pillar &s;tands, but &s;o far di&s;tant from it, that unle&s;s a map or pilot directs the mariner how to &s;teer, he mu&s;t infallibly take it for the entrance of the Bo&s;phorus or canal of Con&s;tantinople. Several hundred Turki&s;h boats are wrecked upon it yearly.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott</HI> &s;ays, that when he was at Con&s;tantinople, &s;eventy &s;ail of &s;hips loaded with corn, were ca&s;t away in one night, by mi&s;&s;ing the mouth of the &s;traits; which brought on &s;uch a &s;carcity of corn within the city, as nearly to have occa&s;ioned a very &s;erious in&s;urrection. This event, however, he attributes more to a &s;pecies of abu&s;e and iniquity, which will &s;carce appear credible, than to the dangers of the &s;ea. For, &s;ays the baron, two light-hou&s;es very lofty, and placed at the mouth of the Black &s;ea, on the head-lands in Europe and A&s;ia, have been erected to point out to &s;ailors the entrance into the &s;traits. The oil they con&s;ume is furni&s;hed by government, and per&s;ons are appointed to light them up and keep them in order. Yet this &s;ame government permits the fabrication of charcoal all over the coa&s;t; though it is ea&s;y to perceive that under this pretence, the inhabitants frequently kindle fires, which, in bad weather, deceive and mi&s;|lead the mariner. Nay further, the keepers of the towers frequently hide the lights, &s;ays the baron, to procure &s;hipwrecks, which they very well know how to turn to their advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="155">From the Crimea to Con&s;tantinople it is u&s;ually a pa&s;&s;age of two days, or a little more; but I have told my company, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> "I expect to be &s;even.

<P>The Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, or canal of Con&s;tanti|nople, as it is generally called, begins at the point of Scutari, nearly oppo&s;ite to Con&s;tantinople, and extends to Pompey's pillar. It is about twenty miles in length, and a mile and a quarter in breadth, where it is narrowe&s;t. This canal or channel is formed by the body of water which runs from the Black &s;ea, into the &s;ea of Marmora or White &s;ea, which name it after|wards obtains, till it reaches the Dardanelles, where

it again runs in a very narrow channel, into the Archipelago. There is a very &s;trong current, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> at the entrance of the canal from the Black Sea. It appears, however, that the&s;e currents are more &s;en&s;ibly &s;elt at the &s;traits of the Dardanelles. The &s;urplus of waters which the Black &s;ea receives, and which cannot be evaporated, pouring into the Mediterranean, through the canal, or Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, and the Propontis, another name given by the ancients to the &s;ea of Marmora, occa&s;ions, likewi&s;e, at the Dardanelles, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> currents &s;o violent, that frequently &s;hips can &s;carcely &s;tem them with all their &s;ails &s;et.</P>
<P>It does not appear, however, that the current is in the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome in the canal, as part of what are called the &s;uburbs of Con&s;tantinople &s;tand, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in A&s;ia. Nothing, &s;ays Lady <HI>Mary Wortley Montague,</HI> can be plea&s;anter than the canal, and the Turks are &s;o well acquainted with its beauties, that all their plea&s;ure &s;eats are built on its banks, where they have at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pects in Europe and A&s;ia; &s;o that there are near one another &s;ome hundreds of magnificent palaces. For an extent of twenty miles, as far as Pompey's pillar, the A&s;iatic &s;ide is covered with fruit trees, villages, and the mo&s;t delightful land&s;capes in nature; the canal winding all along in a &s;erpentine figure from the Euxine &s;ea. On the European &s;ide, &s;tands

Con&s;tantinople &s;ituated on &s;even hills, with a great number of &s;eraglios, fine gardens and plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, called by the Turks, Kio&s;hs; &s;o that both the&s;e &s;hores make a mo&s;t enchanting and delightful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;phorus takes a &s;udden turn at Bouyukdere, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> who approached it from the Black &s;ea: "but my pen will but feebly repeat what Mr. <HI>Gibbon</HI> in his account of the &s;ingular &s;ituation of Con&s;tanti|nople, has de&s;cribed, in language maje&s;tic as the &s;ubject de&s;erves. But I am certain no language can amu&s;e or plea&s;e, in compari&s;on with the view which the borders of this famed &s;traits compo&s;e; rocks, ver|dure, ancient ca&s;tles built on the &s;ummit of the hills by the Genoe&s;e, who once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; the modern kio&s;hs, or &s;ummer-hou&s;es, with blinds all round, mi|narets and large plantane trees ri&s;ing promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the vallies, large meadows, multitudes of people, and boats &s;warming on the &s;hore and on the water; and what is particular, nothing to be &s;een like a formal French garden. The Turks having &s;o great a re&s;pect for natural beauties, that if they mu&s;t build a hou&s;e where a tree &s;tands, they leave a large hole for the tree to pa&s;s through and increa&s;e in &s;ize, conceiving the branches of it to be the prettie&s;t orna|ment for the top of their hou&s;e; in truth, contra&s;t a chimney to a beautiful foliage, and judge if they are right or wrong.

ma&s;ts of which are intermingled with the trees, and a graceful confu&s;ion and variety, make this living pic|ture the mo&s;t picture&s;que &s;cene I ever beheld."</P>
<P>The &s;ea of Marmora, Propontis, or the White &s;ea, for it has all the&s;e different names, extends from Con|&s;tantinople to Gallipoli. It is called White &s;ea in oppo&s;ition to the Euxine, or Black &s;ea, and it derives its name of Marmora from &s;ome i&s;lands &s;o called in the middle of it. This &s;ea of Marmora is properly a large gulph, communicating both with the Black &s;ea, by the canal of Con&s;tantinople, and with the Archi|pelago by the Helle&s;pont or Dardenelles. It is 120 miles in length and 50 broad. There is &s;carce any part of the world, except Holland, that can &s;hew within &s;o &s;mall a circumference &s;o many large cities, as are to be &s;een round this plea&s;ant &s;ea. The famous Chizico, the celebrated Nice, the plea&s;ant Apamia, the charming Nicomedia, the unfortunate Chalcedon, and &s;everal other cities which A&s;ia could formerly &s;hew on the banks of the Propontis, are &s;ufficient marks that in this quarter of the globe nothing was wanting to render the &s;ea-&s;hores beautiful.</P>
<P>In the Propontis there are &s;everal i&s;lands which give name to the whole &s;ea. The principal one Marmora, is about ten leagues in circumference. The <HI>Caloyers,</HI> or Greek monks have here &s;everal con|vents or hermitages. There are al&s;o three others
<PB N="154" REF="160">
which go by the &s;ame name, and which lye at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other. The&s;e i&s;lands abound in cattle, corn, wine, fruits, cotton, &amp;c. They have al&s;o great quantities of fi&s;h. Nearer to Con&s;tanti|nople lyes another clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands. Were the&s;e i&s;lands in the hands of the Chri&s;tians, they would be &s;o many gardens of paradi&s;e; but being ex|po&s;ed to the ravages of the Turks, who go there on parties of plea&s;ure, and frequently plunder the gar|dens and vineyards of the Greeks, when elevated with liquor, they lye almo&s;t wholly uncultivated.</P>
<P>From the &s;traits of the Bo&s;phorus to tho&s;e of the Helle&s;pont, is a di&s;tance of about 50 leagues, the la&s;t twelve of which are tho&s;e of the Helle&s;pont, dividing as does the Bo&s;phorus, Europe from A&s;ia. The inter|mediate &s;pace between the two, is the little &s;ea of of Marmora, where the waters have con&s;iderable breadth, and contains the i&s;le of Marmora (exceeding high ground) &s;o called from the quarries of marble contained in it, and lying about twelve leagues from the &s;traits. Its ancient name was Procone&s;us. The &s;ea of Marmora and the Black &s;ea, have been called the two brea&s;ts of Con&s;tantinople; for let whatever wind blow, it is always furni&s;hed, by one or other of the&s;e &s;eas, with abundance of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the narrowe&s;t part of the Helle&s;pont, next the Archipelago, where the &s;trait is not more than half
<PB N="155" REF="161">
a mile wide, (called the Dardanelles, &s;o called from <HI>Dardanus,</HI> formerly a king of that country) two ca&s;tles are erected on each &s;hore, where every &s;hip that pa&s;&s;es from the Archipelago is examined, and they thus become a key to Con&s;tantinople. On a rock in the middle of the Helle&s;pont &s;tands a town, in which the Turks have &s;ome &s;mall cannon. The Turks u&s;e it as a watch-tower, and it is a good &s;ea-mark to &s;teer by. In the middle of this rock is a &s;pring of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>This famous &s;trait is &s;aid to have received its name from <HI>Helle,</HI> daughter of <HI>Athamas</HI> king of Thebes, who with her brother <HI>Phrixus,</HI> endeavouring to e&s;cape from the treachery of their mother-in-law <HI>Ino,</HI> peri&s;hed in the&s;e waters.</P>
<P><HI>Chandler,</HI> in &s;ailing through the Dardanelles towards Con&s;tantinople &s;ays, we now &s;aw a level and exten|&s;ive plain, the &s;cene as we conceived, of the battle of the Iliad, with barrows of heroes. The narrowne&s;s of the Helle&s;pont, the &s;moothne&s;s of the water, and the rippling of the current reminded me of the Thames. <HI>Xerxes</HI> but &s;lightly degraded it, when he called it a &s;alt river. He cro&s;&s;ed it 3000 years ago, with an army almo&s;t innumerable over a bridge of 700 boats. The Turks cro&s;&s;ed it &s;ince with more &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Helle&s;pont was the &s;trait acro&s;s which <HI>Leander</HI> tried to &s;wim; and they have a town on the A&s;iatic
<PB N="156" REF="162">
coa&s;t, that &s;till bears his name. When Lady <HI>Miller</HI> &s;aw the &s;hort di&s;tance between the two &s;hores, &s;he &s;aw nothing impo&s;&s;ible in the &s;tory of <HI>Leander,</HI> or any thing wonderful in <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s bridge of boats. It is &s;o narrow a gut, &s;ays &s;he, that 'tis not &s;urpri&s;ing a young man &s;hould attempt to &s;wim acro&s;s it, or an ambitious king to pa&s;s his army over it. But then being &s;o &s;ubject to &s;torms, 'tis no wonder the lover peri&s;hed, and the bridge was broken. The months of July and Augu&s;t are mo&s;t unfavourable for pa&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The Helle&s;pont, <HI>Xerxes, Leander,</HI> and <HI>Hero!</HI> &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani.</HI> What a contra&s;t of ideas do not the&s;e names excite in us!&mdash;How much is the fate of <HI>Leander</HI> to be envied!&mdash;<HI>Xerxes,</HI> thy greatne&s;s was but &s;moke; for tor|mented by ambition, thou had&s;t no enjoyment of any thing; but <HI>Leander</HI> was loved, his pa&s;&s;ion con&s;tituted his happine&s;s!&mdash;The&s;e ideas pre&s;ent them&s;elves &s;o naturally on our pa&s;&s;age through this celebrated &s;trait, that, for the moment, we feel love &s;uperior to ambition.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of Turkey in Europe are the Danube, which runs into the Black &s;ea by different <HI>em|bouchures;</HI> the Dnei&s;ter on the we&s;tern borders of Oczakow Tartary, running a little above the Danube into the Black &s;ea, and the Dnieper, on the ea&s;tern borders of the &s;ame country, which likewi&s;e falls into the Black &s;ea at Oczakow. There are al&s;o the Don
<PB N="157" REF="163">
running into the &s;ea of A&s;oph, and the Save, which empties it&s;elf into the Danube below Belgrade. The cour&s;e of the&s;e rivers has been treated of already, when we &s;poke of Ru&s;&s;ia and Hungary. There are al&s;o many other &s;maller rivers which have been celebrated by the poets and hi&s;torians, particularly in Natolia and the Morea, of which we &s;hall take occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter, when de&s;cribing Greece.</P>
<P>The lakes are not very remarkable, nor are they mentioned with any degree of accuracy either by ancient or modern writers. The principal ones are tho&s;e in Albania, communicating with each other. The large&s;t called Lago di Scutari, remarkable for a town, in one of its i&s;lands, which was formerly the &s;eat of the kings of Illyricum. In the Morea are likewi&s;e the Stymphalis, well known for the many ravenous birds that frequented it; and the Phineus, which was the &s;ource of the river Styx, who&s;e waters were of &s;uch remarkable coldne&s;s as to freeze tho&s;e per&s;ons to death who drank of them. They al&s;o cor|rode iron and copper; for which very &s;ingular virtues, the ancient poets feigned this river to be the river of hell.</P>
<P>The principal cities of this empire, are Con&s;tanti|nople, Adrianople, Smyrna, and Belgrade. Belgrade we have de&s;cribed when &s;peaking of Hungary. The other three we &s;hall de&s;cribe in their turns.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="164">The province in which the two great cities of Con&s;tantinople and Adrianople &s;tands, is the ancient Thrace, of which &s;uch frequent mention is made by the Greek and Latin hi&s;torians. What is very re|markable, is, that though &s;o near each other, the&s;e are the two principal cities in the whole Turki&s;h empire, and the only cities of any celebrity in European Tur|key. This province was anciently divided into twenty nations, who according to Pliny, were afterwards made tributary to the Macedonians. It was conquered by the Romans under <HI>Caius Stribonius Curio,</HI> the pro|con&s;ul, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the ea&s;tern emperors, till it fell under the dominion of the Turks, about four hun|dred years &s;ince.</P>
<P>The country is for the mo&s;t part level, though in|ter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome large and remarkable mountains; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is Mount Hoemus, dividing the province to the north from Bulgaria. The next in &s;ize is Rhodope, celebrated by the ancient poets for the cata&s;trophe of <HI>Orpheus.</HI> Hoemus and Rhodope, the former of which will be more fully noticed in our account of Bulgaria, are two long ridges of mountains, extending from the frontiers of Macedonia to the Black &s;ea.</P>
<P>The only river of any note is the Mantza, anciently the Haebrus, which ri&s;es at the foot of mount Rhodope,
<PB N="159" REF="165">
on the borders of Macedonia, and running ea&s;tward by Philippopoli and Adrianople, turns to the &s;outh|ward, and runs into the Aegean &s;ea.</P>

<P>CONSTANTINOPLE is doubtle&s;s one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t celebrated cities of Europe. Its &s;ituation at the ea&s;tern extremity of Romania, is the mo&s;t agreeable and advantageous that can be imagined. The &s;trait which &s;eparates it from A&s;ia is nearly as broad as the Thames at Grave&s;end. The city &s;tands on more ground than that of London, and the inha|bitants are computed at a million and a half, including tho&s;e of the &s;uburbs of Galata, Pera, and Scutari.</P>
<P>Its original name was Byzantium, and it was built by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> king of Sparta. The emperor <HI>Severus</HI> de|moli&s;hed it, to puni&s;h the rebellion of the inhabitants. But <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great rebuilt it, and called it after his own name. In the year 330 it was con&s;ecrated by him for the &s;eat of the Roman empire, a more eligible &s;ituation than its ancient capital, Rome. After the divi&s;ion of the empire, it became the &s;eat of the ea&s;tern emperors, from whom in 1209, it was taken by the Venetians and French, but recovered by the Paloeologi fifty years after, and fell into the hands of
<PB N="160" REF="166">
the Turks on Whit&s;unday, 1453, who have kept it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Byzantium, in its pri&s;tine &s;tate, con&s;i&s;ted of no more than that triangular &s;pot, of which the pre&s;ent &s;eraglio forms one of its angles, and who&s;e two &s;ides are wa&s;hed by the harbour and the &s;ea of Marmora. So that was <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> alive at this day, he would not know the place. Con&s;tantinople, in its pre&s;ent form, is one of the fine&s;t cities in the world for its &s;ituation and its port. It is frequently called the Porte by way of eminence. The pro&s;pect from it is noble. It abounds with antiquities. The mo&s;que of St. Sophia, once a Chri&s;tian church, is thought to exceed, in grandeur and architecture, St. Peter's at Rome. The city it&s;elf is built in a triangular form, with the &s;e|raglio &s;tanding on the point of the angles, from whence there is a delightful pro&s;pect of the coa&s;t of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, which is not to be equalled. It &s;tands, like ancient Rome, on &s;even hills, and by an expre&s;s order, in&s;cribed on a &s;tone-pillar, was called New Rome; but &s;o little of the ancient city remains, that <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> as I have ob&s;erved, would &s;carce know it again. Though ancient Byzantium was reckoned the mo&s;t delightful, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t convenient place for trade in the whole world; yet of the pre&s;ent Con&s;tantinople, it may be &s;aid, that nothing can exceed it in point of &s;ituation and neighbourhood.</P>

<P><PB N="161" REF="168">The harbour is an arm of the &s;ea, running from the canal of the Black &s;ea, and wa&s;hing one &s;ide of that triangular piece of ground on which Byzantium &s;tood. To form a better idea of this de&s;cription we mu&s;t refer the reader to the plan annexed. This harbour is about three miles long and one broad, capacious enough to hold 1200 &s;ail of &s;hips, and &s;o deep, that &s;hips of great burden may unload at the very quays. It is nece&s;&s;ary only to throw out a plank to get on &s;hore. The harbour is in the form of a cre&s;cent, north of the city, and a &s;mall river of fre&s;h water empties it&s;elf into it at the upper end. Here the fre&s;h water is dammed up for convenience, and formed into &s;quare ba&s;ons to imitate tho&s;e of Marly. The noble&s;t view of this metropolis is either taken from the middle of the harbour, or from the &s;uburbs of Galata on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide. From hence, as the city &s;tanding upon ground ri&s;ing gradually from the water's edge, a con|&s;iderable way back, and the hou&s;es being &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that one does not ob&s;truct the &s;ight of another, the whole forms a circular and magnificent amphitheatre, &s;o as that the whole may be &s;een at one view; and when the &s;un &s;hines upon it, the multitude of glittering domes and gilded &s;pires &s;een, intermixed with groves of cypre&s;s and ever-greens, exhibits a &s;ight un|paralleled in any part of the globe.</P>
<P>The &s;eraglio, as we have ob&s;erved, &s;tands on the point of the triangle, which runs out between the
<PB N="162" REF="169">
White &s;ea and the harbour; and underneath this palace, on the declivity of the hill, are the gardens. At the other angle on the White &s;ea, &s;tands the ca&s;tle of the &s;even towers, built before the city came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Turks, and u&s;ed as a pri&s;on for &s;tate-criminals. On the third angle, at the extremity of the harbour, are the ruins of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s palace.</P>
<P>The harbour of Con&s;tantinople, &s;ays <HI>Sertini,</HI> is about two miles in circumference, and the city about twelve. The number of gates that we reckoned up, in making the tour of the walls, including tho&s;e which go into the &s;eraglio and into the gardens, amounted to twenty-five.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething more of this harbour, &s;o worthy admiration. Its entrance being placed between the White and Black &s;ea, who&s;e &s;treams are oppo&s;ite each other, when the wind prevents &s;hips from coming to the city by one of the&s;e channels, it &s;erves to bring them down by the other. For there are but two &s;orts of wind that blow here, the north and the &s;outh. When the north wind blows, nothing can be brought from the White &s;ea to Con&s;tanti|nople, becau&s;e ve&s;&s;els cannot get into the canal or Bo&s;phorus; but then &s;hips coming down the canal from the Euxine or Black &s;ea, having a fair wind, can get up to the city, and furni&s;h it with provi&s;ion and what|ever el&s;e is wanting. On the contrary, when the
<PB N="163" REF="170">
wind is in the &s;outh, nothing can be brought from the Black &s;ea, but any &s;hip may &s;ail up the canal from the White &s;ea, &s;o that the&s;e two winds may be con&s;idered the two keys of Con&s;tantinople, which open and &s;hut up the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The air in &s;ummer would be very hot and &s;uffi|cating, were it not for a breeze which comes every afternoon from the mouth of the harbour; yet the city is &s;o very healthy, that no di&s;ea&s;es are known here be&s;ides the plague; but it is very &s;ubject to earth|quakes, two of which are &s;ometimes felt in a day.</P>
<P>This city is of uncommon extent, having twenty-five gates, &s;ix of which are on the land &s;ide, and nine|teen towards the &s;ea. There is a double wall on the land &s;ide, each of which has a large trench belonging to it. The cannon and the port-holes are near two-hundred and fifty in all. The inner wall is at lea&s;t eighteen feet high, &s;o that it &s;erves to defend the outer|mo&s;t wall: both of them are built up in &s;ome places with free-&s;tone, and in others with brick.</P>
<P>This double wall is &s;aid to have been built under the reign of the younger <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> by <HI>Cyrus</HI> the go|vernor, with which the people were &s;o plea&s;ed, that they gave public demon&s;trations of their joy, and made ver&s;es in its commendation, which were &s;ung about the &s;treets. They &s;aid <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> had indeed erected the
<PB N="164" REF="171">
city, but that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had enlarged and adorned it. They even went &s;o far as to propo&s;e changing its name into that of Cyrople. At this, <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> was &s;o jealous, that he ordered <HI>Cyrus</HI> to be confined in a mona&s;tery, where he died of grief.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of the architecture of the&s;e walls and tow|ers, &s;ays Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> is exactly like that of Warwick and Berkeley ca&s;tles; but many of the &s;quare towers which &s;erve as gateways, are mouldering away under the negligence of the Turks; mo&s;t of whom believe in an ancient prophecy, which announces that the time is near, when the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia is to make her public and triumphal entry through one of the&s;e towers, as Empre&s;s of Greece, into Con&s;tantinople. Many of the Turks have even made up their minds, and already taken mea&s;ures to tran&s;port them&s;elves acro&s;s the Bo&s;phorus into A&s;ia; nay, &s;ome go &s;o very far, as to point to the very identical gateway, through which the empre&s;s is to proceed. To &s;ome nations it would be very agreeable, that the Turki&s;h empire were driven from a &s;ituation, which &s;eems by nature formed as an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;age for trading nations, which the inactivity of the Turks has too long ob&s;tructed. And it is to be wi&s;hed by all tho&s;e who bear any re&s;pect to the be&s;t monuments of &s;culpture, that Athens, and all it yet contains, might not by Mahometan ignorance be entirely de&s;troyed; at pre&s;ent, ruins that would adorn a virtuo&s;o's cabinet, are daily burnt into lime
<PB N="165" REF="172">
by the Turks, and pieces of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip &s;tuck into a wall or a fountain.</P>
<P>Situated at the ea&s;tern extremity of Europe, near the Black &s;ea, it is only &s;eparated from A&s;ia by the Bo&s;phorus of Thrace, which channel forms a com|munication, as has been before remarked, between the two &s;eas, and di&s;charges, on the &s;outh &s;ide, that &s;urplus of waters which the Black &s;ea pours into it from the north. As the current runs fir&s;t into the harbour, and circulates round it, before it rejoins the &s;tream into the White &s;ea, the port of Con&s;tantinople is continually clean&s;ing it&s;elf, from all the rubbi&s;h and filth with which it is daily encumbered.</P>
<P>If ambition, de&s;irous of univer&s;al dominion, had con&s;ulted a map of the world, to di&s;cover the mo&s;t proper &s;ituation for the capital of its empire, that of Con&s;tantinople, without doubt, had been preferred. Placed between two &s;eas, this city would be, at once, the centre of agriculture, commerce, arts, and &s;ciences; did not the infatuated hand of de&s;poti&s;m break every in&s;trument of culture and indu&s;try for twenty leagues round. Con&s;tantinople, inclo&s;ed within the circle of its ancient walls, pre&s;ents the traveller with nothing on the land &s;ide, but an appearance of di&s;&s;olution; while towards the &s;ea, a thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els in the centre of an immen&s;e amphitheatre are continually arriving from all nations, to bring that tribute which the whole world
<PB N="166" REF="173">
owes to its metropolis. Ancient Byzantium, the walls of which &s;erve at pre&s;ent for the boundaries to the &s;eraglio of the Grand Signor, placed on the extremity of the cape, which forms and &s;huts in the port, pre&s;ents to the eye a fore&s;t of cypre&s;s-trees, the tops of which, &s;ur|mounted by an infinite number of cupolas, covered with lead, and ornamented with gilded globes, form a pyramid with the tower of the Divan which ri&s;es above them. This group, &s;trongly &s;haded, &s;eems to detach it&s;elf from the re&s;t of the picture, which pre&s;ents no other variety, but that of &s;ome &s;cattered edifices, that heavily overpower the objects by which they are &s;ur|rounded. The port, from the headland of the &s;eraglio to the fre&s;h waters, the name given to that river which falls into the &s;ea at the bottom of the port, extends above two thou&s;and fathoms farther in length than the other &s;ides of that triangle by which Con&s;tantinople is bounded.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore are the immen&s;e &s;uburbs which inclo&s;e the city of Galata, and the&s;e pre&s;ent a picture, the richne&s;s of which is &s;till farther increa&s;|ed and diver&s;ified, by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive villages which unite and blend them&s;elves on the edge of the Bo&s;pho|rus, for &s;ix leagues towards the Black &s;ea. This chain of buildings, continued on the coa&s;t of A&s;ia, rejoins at Scrutari; which city being only a little more than a mile from the entrance of the port, to which it is oppo&s;ite, is as it were another &s;uburb to Con&s;tantinople,
<PB N="167" REF="174">
and affords it a mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect. The boats which ince&s;&s;antly traver&s;e the &s;pace that lyes between the two cities &s;eem to unite Europe with A&s;ia. In the morning other boats convey the villagers of the Bo&s;|phorus to the labour of the capital, by which they are maintained, and bring them back to their hou&s;es in the evening. An infinite number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els are likewi&s;e employed for the convenience of the inhabi|tants; and if we add, the tran&s;ports, pa&s;&s;ing and re|pa&s;&s;ing, and carrying tho&s;e provi&s;ions to the capital, which the Black &s;ea and the Archipelago daily furni&s;h, together with the activity of foreign commerce, pour|ing in perpetual &s;upplies for elegance and luxury, we &s;hall have &s;ome &s;mall idea of the motion which con|&s;tantly agitates this bu&s;y &s;cene.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I give you an adequate idea, &s;ays <HI>Sertini,</HI> of the prodigious quantity of different kinds of ve&s;&s;els which are to be &s;een in the harbour of Con&s;tantinople? The number of per&s;ons continually going from Con|&s;tantinople to Galata and other places, is &s;o great, that the harbour has more the appearance of a high road crowded with pa&s;&s;engers, than of a &s;ea; the boats mo&s;t frequently made u&s;e of, are &s;o light that they are only to be kept in a proper equilibrium, when &s;ailing, by the watermen &s;kilfully humouring their oars, and the po&s;ition of their bodies, to the motion of the wind.</P>
<P>But though nothing can plea&s;e the eye more than the external appearance of Con&s;tantinople, the charm
<PB N="168" REF="175">
is immediately di&s;&s;olved on entering the city. The narrowne&s;s of the greater part of the &s;treets, where the over-hanging roofs of the hou&s;es &s;carcely leave a pa&s;&s;age for the light; the flinty pavement of which no care is taken; and the want of every kind of cleanline&s;s are, &s;ays baron <HI>Tott,</HI> among the &s;malle&s;t faults of this capital.</P>
<P>The number of hou&s;es in this city mu&s;t needs be prodi|gious, &s;ince one fire alone has been known to burn down 30,000 in a day, without greatly changing the a&s;pect of the city. They compute about 3770 &s;treets in the city, &s;mall and great, but they are &s;eldom or ever clean. To add to the inconvenience of being narrow and dirty, they are likewi&s;e &s;lippery, as they in general run along &s;ome declivity, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are low, being built only of wood and plai&s;ter, yet crowd|ed with inhabitants. The be&s;t hou&s;es &s;tand in places which are lea&s;t &s;ubject to any great concour&s;e of people, and where the city is mo&s;t thinly inhabited; and the fine&s;t buildings are without the city near the harbour. The &s;treet called Adrianople is the longe&s;t and broad|e&s;t. There is no order, no architecture, no dignity, to be found in the hou&s;es, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci;</HI> the mo&s;ques or churches alone merit the attention of &s;trangers, and of the&s;e there are 934, great and &s;mall. Ten of them are called royal mo&s;ques and are truly &s;uperb. But after viewing that of St. Sophia, which we &s;hall here|after particularly notice, there is little to be &s;een in the re&s;t; for they are all built on one plan; however,
<PB N="169" REF="176">
their &s;ituations are delightful, and not incumbered with &s;urrounding buildings as in other cities, and on that account they attract the notice of pa&s;&s;engers. St. Sophia is nearly oppo&s;ite the great gate of the &s;eraglio, from whence the Ottoman court takes the name of the Sublime Porte.</P>
<P>There are a great number of large &s;quares in Con|&s;tantinople, but only two of them kept in good order; the re&s;t are filthy and quite neglected. The principal and the mo&s;t beautiful, is the &s;quare of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> in the centre of which are two &s;uperb, marble pyramids; one ornamented with hieroglyphics, the other plain; the ba&s;es of the&s;e pyramids re&s;t upon four large, marble globes, which repo&s;e upon fine &s;quare pede&s;tals. In the &s;ame &s;quare, are the remains of a noble column, in the form of a &s;erpent, made of bra&s;s; which the Turks when they took Con&s;tantinople, mi&s;taking for gold, began to demoli&s;h, but were prevented by their officers, on finding it to be merely ba&s;e metal.</P>
<P>The &s;quare which <HI>Habe&s;ci</HI> calls the &s;quare of Sultana <HI>Achmet,</HI> is called by the Turks <HI>Atmeiden,</HI> or a place of hor&s;es, and by the ancients the hippodrome or circus. In the time of the ea&s;tern emperors this was the place where the hor&s;e-races were held, and on extraordinary occa&s;ions, public &s;hews were exhibited. The cu&s;tom of exerci&s;ing hor&s;es in this place &s;till continues. Feats of activity are likewi&s;e di&s;played by the Turks here,
<PB N="170" REF="177">
in throwing the <HI>Gerit</HI> or dart on full gallop. Its di|men&s;ions are &s;till the &s;ame as formerly, 400 paces long and 100 broad, forming an oblong &s;quare, flanked on three of the &s;ides with hou&s;es, and on the fourth with the walls of the mo&s;que of Sultan <HI>Achmet.</HI> Between friends, &s;ays Lady <HI>Montague,</HI> our &s;quares would make a pitiful figure compared with this, as our cathedral of St. Paul's would with the mo&s;que of St. Sophia. The account which Lady <HI>M</HI>&mdash; gives of the column and pillar, &s;eems &s;o much more accurate, and more to be depended on than that of <HI>Habe&s;ci;</HI> that we &s;hall take the liberty to notice it. In the mid&s;t of the hippo|drome is a brazen column of three &s;erpents twi&s;ted together, with their mouths gaping&mdash;'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ays &s;he, to learn why &s;o odd a pillar was erected; the Greeks can give nothing but fabulous legends, when they are a&s;ked the meaning of it, and there is no &s;ign of its ever having had any in&s;cription. At the upper end is an obeli&s;k of porphyry, probably brought from Egypt, the hieroglyphics all very entire, which by many per&s;ons are con&s;idered as &s;o many ancient puns. It is placed upon four little brazen pillars, a pede&s;tal of &s;quare free &s;tone, full of figures in bas-relief on two &s;ides; one &s;quare repre&s;enting a battle, another an a&s;&s;embly. The others have in&s;criptions in Greek and Latin.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed this obeli&s;k was built in the time of the emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> From the in&s;criptions it ap|pears,
<PB N="171" REF="178">
that the emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> cau&s;ed it to be &s;et up again, after it had lain a long time on the ground, and the engines which were made u&s;e of in rai&s;ing it, are repre&s;ented in bas-relief. The obeli&s;k is de&s;cribed to be of granite or Thebaic marble, compo&s;ed on one &s;ingle &s;haft about fifty feet high, and terminating in a point.</P>
<P>The Turks, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> inform travellers that this bra&s;s &s;erpentine pillar was erected by the Emperor <HI>Leo,</HI> as a charm again&s;t the malignity of tho&s;e dreadful &s;er|pents, which at that time infe&s;ted the city and neigh|hood. Others imagine, that by the three &s;erpents, are &s;ymbolically repre&s;ented the three parts of the world; for the fourth was not then di&s;covered, and that the union of them into one, repre&s;ented the union of three parts of the world, which at that time was but one body, by the union of the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern empires.</P>
<P>In the great &s;treet which runs from the gate of Adri|anople to the &s;eraglio, there is another column without any &s;culpture, but yet much richer than any of the former, becau&s;e it is of porphyry. At pre&s;ent it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h it from common marble, it being very much di&s;coloured by a fire that many years &s;ince burnt down the hou&s;es &s;urrounding it. This pillar, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> has been defaced by different conflagrations, and has been bound with &s;even rings of iron, by the Emperor <HI>Manuel,</HI> as an in&s;cription
<PB N="172" REF="179">
upon its &s;ummit denotes.&mdash;<HI>Habe&s;ci</HI> &s;ays, it is of a &s;ur|pri&s;ing height, and the chief material is bitumen, but badly put together; yet it appears, &s;ays he, to have been purpo&s;ely con&s;tructed in that rude manner: upon the whole, this column is a great my&s;tery, for no per&s;on can explain its meaning. The Turks hold it in venera|tion, and different &s;ultans have occa&s;ionally alighted from their hor&s;es, and de&s;cended into the &s;ubterranean chambers under it, to view its curio&s;ities. The Chri&s;tians, likewi&s;e, venerate this column, and pretend that there may &s;till be &s;een in the cavern, tho&s;e ba&s;kets which our Saviour ordered to be filled with the frag|ments of loaves and fi&s;hes, after he had fed the multi|tude in the de&s;ert. The Mu&s;&s;ulmen do not deny this; but they add, that in the &s;aid cavern there are, in a &s;mall box, made of a &s;ingle brilliant, &s;ome drops of the &s;eed of Mahomet, and that whoever touches this box is &s;ure to have children.</P>
<P>There &s;tood another pillar in this city called the Hi&s;to|rical pillar, now no more. It dropped down, &s;ays Lady <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, about two years before I came into this part of the world. It was a column in honour of <HI>Arcadius,</HI> and being almo&s;t the only ve&s;tige of antiquity in that famous city of the world, we &s;hall relate <HI>Chi&s;hull</HI>'s ac|count of it, who &s;aw it. This lofty and a&s;piring pillar, &s;ays he, is of the Doric order, and built with wonder|ful regularity and exactne&s;s of architecture, bearing on the ba&s;is, and on the whole &s;haft from top to bot|tom,
<PB N="173" REF="180">
various warlike figures of men in arms, chariots, gallies, and other ornaments, which in a &s;piral manner encircle the whole pillar; every figure being &s;o well proportioned to the di&s;tance, from whence it is &s;een, that tho&s;e at the top, the middle, and the bottom, ap|pear to the eye exactly of the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>
<P>It is called the Hi&s;torical Column, becau&s;e all the remarkable events during the reign of <HI>Arcadius,</HI> were repre&s;ented on its different &s;ides, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of <HI>Trajan</HI> are repre&s;ented on his pillar at Rome. But this latter is only 123 feet in height, whereas the for|mer was 147 feet high, according to <HI>Gyllius</HI>'s account, who hath given &s;o accurate a de&s;cription of Con&s;tantinople. It is a pity that &s;o remarkable a monument, &s;hould have been &s;uffered to have peri&s;hed by the negligence of the Turks, to which it was probably more owing than to the barbarous hand of time. <HI>Spon</HI> and <HI>Wheeler</HI> mention their having di&s;covered in the hou&s;e of a private Turk|i&s;h nobleman a column of the Emperor <HI>Marcian.</HI> It is entirely of &s;potted marble, about fifteen feet high, and its capital, of the Corinthian order. Upon its top is a &s;quare hollow &s;tone, adorned with four eagles at the four corners, in which the heart of that prince is &s;up|po&s;ed to be depo&s;ited. Two ver&s;es at the foot of the column acquaint the reader al&s;o, that the body of <HI>Marcian</HI> lyes beneath the column.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="181">The &s;quare of Sultan <HI>Bajazet</HI> is not quite &s;o large as the former, but it is delightfully &s;ituated on one of the &s;even hills on which Con&s;tantinople is built. This &s;quare is ornamented with &s;ome &s;tately buildings, par|ticularly with the mo&s;que of Sultan <HI>Bajazet,</HI> and the old &s;eraglio; which was formerly the palace of the emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the <HI>great,</HI> and of &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The hou&s;e of the <HI>Aga,</HI> or commander in chief of the Jani&s;&s;aries &s;tands upon the a&s;cent to the &s;quare, and on this ac|count is much frequented by per&s;ons of rank; fairs are likewi&s;e kept here, which makes it the re&s;ort of mer|chants and traders.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Kom-capi,</HI> or &s;and gate, there is a &s;mall mo&s;que, formerly a Chri&s;tian church; every Chri&s;tian is prohibited entering the &s;treet in which it is &s;ituated, under pain of death; and the rea&s;on given for this by the Turks is, that the prophet occa&s;ionally &s;hews him|&s;elf in this mo&s;que in all his glory, and delivers his &s;pecial orders to his faithful di&s;ciples. There are Mu&s;|&s;ulmen, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> above the common &s;ort, who a&s;&s;ur|ed me very &s;incerely, that they had had the happine&s;s to &s;ee the &s;acred prophet; but that the &s;plendour of the rays with which he was &s;urrounded, deprived them for a &s;hort time of their &s;ight.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed the gate of the &s;eraglio, which leads to the fir&s;t court, on the left-hand, there is a large building, which was formerly the private church of the

patriarch St. <HI>John</HI> of Chry&s;o&s;tom; but at pre&s;ent u&s;ed as a repo&s;itory for the arms and banners taken from the enemy in the time of war. In the gallery of the &s;econd floor is the tomb of the holy patriarch, and his effigy in &s;tone; from the tomb i&s;&s;ues a &s;pring of water, which the &s;uper&s;titious e&s;teem as a remedy for all di&s;ea&s;es. The Chri&s;tians make u&s;e of it, and pay the Turks very dear for this medicine. Near this tomb is a large chamber, which is always kept &s;hut, and is &s;aid to be full of the bodies of &s;aints; the Turks keep a lamp con|&s;tantly burning in it. It was upon the &s;quare before this church, that the Empre&s;s <HI>Eudoxia</HI> cau&s;ed her &s;tatue to be erected, that &s;he might be held in veneration by the people; which occa&s;ioned the ruin of St. <HI>John</HI> of Chry&s;o&s;tom.</P>

<P>Many other curio&s;ities were di&s;per&s;ed in differ|ent parts of this city, but the Sultans <HI>O&s;man, Mahomed,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> took them to adorn the &s;ide of their &s;eraglio, where they are hid from public view.</P>

The <HI>Bazars</HI> contain two rows of &s;hops, all &s;upported by arches, and which receive their light from the cupolas at the top; they are &s;hut every night with iron gates, and guards are placed within. Each
<PB N="177" REF="184">
<HI>Bazar</HI> has an <HI>aga</HI> or &s;uperintendant, who lets the &s;hops at a high price, but which is paid with chearfulne&s;s, on account of the &s;afety of the effects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Khans</HI> are a different kind of buildings, which &s;erve for the re&s;idence of foreign merchants, and as warehou&s;es for their commodities. They very much re&s;emble the convents of friars in Chri&s;tian countries, having cloi&s;ters open to an interior quadrangle, in which each merchant has a little chamber to &s;leep in, a kitchen, and one or more rooms for his merchan|dize. There are likewi&s;e large vaults under the&s;e cloi&s;ters, to which the merchandize may be removed in ca&s;e of fire; but it was never known to be nece&s;&s;ary; for as the whole building is of &s;tone, &s;up|ported on arches, and every nece&s;&s;ary precaution taken, no in&s;tance can be given of any damage hap|pening, from either fire or thieves, to the effects lodged in a <HI>Khan.</HI></P>
<P>A merchant has only to apply to the &s;uperintendant, and he will a&s;&s;ign him a lodging, on paying down a quarter, or half a pia&s;ter, which is about four &s;hillings, be&s;ides two or three a&s;pers a-day, whil&s;t he remains there. An a&s;per is &s;omething more than a half-penny, &s;o that the demand is not very exorbitant. The noble&s;t Khan is that called <HI>Valide Khan;</HI> it was built by a dowager empre&s;s. Here foreigners always find accommodations on very ea&s;y terms; and a quilt
<PB N="178" REF="185">
or two, a carpet, and &s;ome cu&s;hions, are all the furni|ture requi&s;ite. The revenue ari&s;ing from the&s;e khans, is u&s;ually applied to &s;ome pious or charitable in&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome khans appropriated entirely to tra|vellers, where they are not only lodged <HI>gratis,</HI> but are al&s;o furni&s;hed with rice and fle&s;h, if they will ac|cept it, which is &s;eldom taken, provi&s;ions being &s;o exceedingly rea&s;onable in this metropolis.</P>
<P>The new &s;eraglio, mo&s;t of the mo&s;ques, the bazars, and the khans, are the only &s;tone buildings. All the private hou&s;es are built with wood; they are painted on the out&s;ide with different colours, which gives them an air of gaiety, and the novelty of the &s;ight cannot but be plea&s;ing to &s;trangers. Though the hou&s;es are built only of wood and plai&s;ter, as has been ob&s;erved before, they are very convenient and richly furni&s;hed; mo&s;t of them command fine pro&s;pects to|wards the &s;ea. There are no carriages for the tran&s;por|tation of goods in this city; porters are the general vehicles made u&s;e of, except for timber, which is carried on the backs of hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are extremely clean and well dre&s;&s;ed, e&s;pecially the Turks, in gay colours, and the cleane&s;t turbans: each per&s;on here is di&s;tingui&s;hed by his
<PB N="179" REF="186">
dre&s;s; and the variety of different &s;haped turbans denote the &s;ituations of the different wearers.</P>
<P>The ladies wear robes of green, red, yellow, and blue, covering their under dre&s;s entirely, which is very rich; they wear a large wrapping piece of mu&s;lin over their head, as low as their eye brows, and another on their chin, reaching, &s;ays Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> to the top of their no&s;e, &s;o that their eyes only are uncovered; they walk very much about the &s;treet, contrary to the received opinion hitherto of their never &s;tirring from their hou&s;es, and the boats on the canals are full of them.</P>
<P>The market-places and large &s;treets in the city of Con&s;tantinople, &s;ays his lord&s;hip, are almo&s;t covered with &s;heds; the merchandize is &s;et forth in the neate&s;t manner, but the du&s;t among &s;uch a number of people being confined, is exceeding trouble&s;ome. The quan|tity of boats in the canal is very great; the boats them|&s;elves, adds his lord&s;hip, are the be&s;t built he ever &s;aw, and the rowers mo&s;t incomparable.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Pera and Con&s;tantinople, likewi&s;e, remarks Lady <HI>Craven,</HI> are &s;o narrow, that few of them admit a carriage; the windows of every &s;tory project over tho&s;e under them; &s;o that at the upper &s;tory, people may &s;ometimes &s;hake hands acro&s;s the &s;treet. No Turk makes a vi&s;it, if it be only four doors from
<PB N="180" REF="187">
his own hou&s;e, but on hor&s;eback; and on my arrival here, &s;ays her lady&s;hip, I &s;aw one who landed in a boat, and had a fine grey hor&s;e led by four men, that went a long way round, which he mounted gravely, to alight from in a few moments.</P>
<P>The ravages made by fires at Con&s;tantinople are not to be wondered at, when it is con&s;idered, that wooden hou&s;es are de&s;troyed in a few minutes, and that the flames meet with no interruption from party walls. Sometimes the communication has been &s;o rapid, that all efforts to &s;top the deva&s;tation have been fruitle&s;s. In the reign of Sultan <HI>Mahmud,</HI> 12,000 hou&s;es were de&s;troyed by one fire; and the &s;ultan finding every effort to prevent the &s;preading of the flames un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, at la&s;t cried out, that he was convinced the fire came from Heaven, and ordered the workmen who were endeavouring to &s;top it, to de&s;i&s;t. But the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance concerning fires in this city is, that after the de&s;truction of four or five thou|&s;and hou&s;es, the whole is rebuilt again in twenty or thirty days, and no appearance remains of the calamity.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal cau&s;es of the frequent fires in this place. Very few of them happen by accident, though the hou&s;es are of wood; but it is this circum|&s;tance which is the great temptation to &s;etting them on fire wilfully.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188">The principal incendiaries are the Jani&s;&s;aries. When they are di&s;contented with the admini&s;tration, but more particularly when they di&s;like the Grand Vizir, they &s;et fire to different parts of the city at once, and repeat this villany till they oblige the Grand Signor to remove his prime mini&s;ter: fires from this cau&s;e, have even been the &s;ignal for depo&s;ing the &s;ultans, when their wi&s;hes were not gratified. Upon the break|ing out of a war, they will likewi&s;e &s;et fire to the city, or &s;uburbs, that they may pillage a booty &s;ufficient to defray the expences of the campaign. Before they marched again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians in the la&s;t war, they &s;et fire to three different quarters of Galata, and rai&s;ed a con|&s;iderable &s;um of money, at the expence of the poor &s;ufferers. Yet &s;uch was the weakne&s;s and timidity of the government, that no example was made, though undoubted evidence was given of the fact.</P>
<P>The &s;laves, when they can place a confidence in each other, and can get together &s;ecretly in any num|ber, &s;et fire to particular quarters, to revenge them|&s;elves on their ma&s;ters, and for the &s;ake of plunder. La&s;tly, the timber merchants, and ironmongers, who&s;e fortunes depend on frequent fires, are &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of employing private agents to promote the&s;e diabolical practices.</P>
<P>To effect their purpo&s;e, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> they com|monly u&s;e <HI>coundaks;</HI> the&s;e con&s;i&s;t of a &s;mall bundle of
<PB N="182" REF="189">
&s;plinters of pine wood, in the middle of which is a piece of <HI>amadoue,</HI> a kind of combu&s;tible fungus like tinder, wrapped up in cotton, and dipped in &s;ulphur. The&s;e <HI>coundaks</HI> they &s;ecretly place behind any door they find open, or put it within &s;ide of a window, and having &s;et it on fire, make off. No more is nece&s;&s;ary, he adds, to cau&s;e the mo&s;t terrible ravages in a city, where the hou&s;es being built of timber and painted with oil of a&s;pic, are ea&s;ily reduced to a&s;hes by the fir&s;t villain who makes the attempt.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>M.</HI> mentions their extraordinary way of war|ming them&s;elves, as another cau&s;e of frequent fire, which is neither by chimnies nor &s;toves, but by a cer|tain machine called a <HI>tendour,</HI> about two feet high, in the form of a table, covered with a fine carpet or embroidery. This is made of wood, and they put into it a &s;mall quantity of hot a&s;hes, and &s;it with their legs under the carpet. At this table they work, read, and very often &s;leep; and if they chance to dream, and kick down the tendour, the hot a&s;hes will then &s;et the hou&s;e on fire. Mo&s;t families, &s;ays her lady&s;hip, have had their hou&s;es burnt down once or twice; and when fires of this &s;ort happen, the owners &s;eem not at all concerned at their misfortune; but put their goods into a bark, and &s;ee their hou&s;es burn with great compo&s;ure; their per&s;ons being very &s;eldom endangered, having no &s;tairs to de&s;cend.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190">The vizir and all the great officers of the Porte are obliged to ha&s;ten on the fir&s;t notice, to any place where a fire breaks out, in order to give &s;uch directions as may be thought nece&s;&s;ary; and if it increa&s;es to any alarming degree, the Grand Signor him&s;elf never fails to attend. The means of his conveyance are always at hand; hor&s;es &s;tand &s;addled, and boats are kept in readine&s;s both by day and night for this purpo&s;e. The great officers, likewi&s;e, take the &s;ame precautions, and are frequently awaked out of their &s;leep to attend on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Certain watchmen are appointed at the different quarters, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to give notice of any fire, on the appearance of which, they run through their di&s;trict, beat the pavement with great &s;taves, headed with iron, and awake the inhabitants by the cry of <HI>yanjenvar!</HI> (there is a fire!) and tell in what part of the city it is. There is likewi&s;e a watchman placed in a very lofty tower, built in the palace of the Aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries which commands a pro&s;pect of Con&s;tantino|ple, and another in a tower of Galata, who&s;e vigilance is employed on the &s;ame object. From the&s;e towers an alarm is given by beating on great drums, which is pre&s;ently &s;pread a long way round, and brings together great numbers, but too deeply intere&s;ted in the acci|dent, and who often arrive too late at their &s;everal &s;hops to prevent their being either burnt or plundered.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="191">Baron <HI>Tott</HI> mentions a conflagration, which, during his re&s;idence, de&s;troyed the palace of the Grand Vizir, and above two-thirds of this prodigious city. The fire broke out near the &s;ea, and the walls of the &s;eraglio. The wind which blew from the north, drove the flame along the walls, and about &s;even o'clock they reached the palace of the Vizir. The Grand Signor had gone thither, but neither his orders, nor the endeavour made to &s;ave this immen&s;e edifice could pre&s;erve it; and the embers it afforded, by giving a fre&s;h activity to the flames, continued to extend the fire with great rapidity. It was, neverthele&s;s, hoped, that when it reached the mo&s;que of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> that ma&s;&s;y building would have proved its boundary; every ex|ertion was therefore made in that quarter, and the pro&s;pect of being able to put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of the flames became probable, when the lead of the Cu|pola, melted by the flaming atmo&s;phere, &s;treaming down the &s;toney gutters, on the guards and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, formed an open field for the fury of the fire.</P>
<P>From that moment all hopes of re&s;training it were given up, and it was &s;uffered to de&s;troy every thing, quite up to the walls, near the &s;ea, on the other &s;ide of the hill. The con&s;ternation now became general, yet it &s;eemed &s;ome con&s;olation, to &s;uppo&s;e it had reached its utmo&s;t limits; when the wind &s;uddenly changing to the ea&s;t, and blowing &s;trong, took this line of fire of more than 1,200 fathoms in length, cro&s;&s;ways; and
<PB N="185" REF="192">
driving it towards the centre of the city, divided it into thirteen branches, the roots of which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively uniting, pre&s;ently rendered Con&s;tantinople, one con|tinued dreadful &s;heet of flame.</P>
<P>A whole regiment of Jani&s;&s;aries, employed to pull down the hou&s;es at the end of one of the branches where the fire &s;pread, was hemmed in on every &s;ide, and peri&s;hed by the rapid advances of the flames. The cries of the&s;e unhappy wretches, with tho&s;e of the women and children, who underwent the &s;ame fate, the noi&s;e of the falling buildings, the crackling of pieces of timber, driven into the atmo&s;phere by the violence of the fire, the tumult of the inhabitants, whom the conflagration threatened on every &s;ide, and who to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the mi&s;eries of want, hazarded their lives to pre&s;erve &s;ome part of their property, all concurred to form a &s;cene of horror which no lan|guage can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The environs of Con&s;tantinople are delightful. Gala|ta is the principal &s;uburb, and Pera is properly &s;peak|ing the &s;uburb of Galata. The&s;e are the places in which the Chri&s;tians have fixed their re&s;idence. All the foreign mini&s;ters inhabit Pera; it &s;tands upon an a&s;cent from which there is a di&s;tinct view of the greate&s;t part of the city. The &s;treets of Pera are &s;o full of Euro|peans, as to give it the appearance of a capital town in &s;ome Chri&s;tian country. The canal, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="193">
which &s;eparates this fine country from Natolia in A&s;ia, is about twice the breadth of the Thames at London; and the oppo&s;ite &s;hore pre&s;ents the &s;ame chain of villages that commence with Scutari, which is oppo&s;ite the &s;e|raglio; and preci&s;ely on the point of land is the tower of <HI>Leander,</HI> as it is called, which is at pre&s;ent a light-hou&s;e for &s;hips coming in, and going out of the canal, and on the coa&s;t of the Black &s;ea. This tower, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> which the Europeans call the tower of <HI>Leander,</HI> and the Turks the tower of the Virgin, lyes between Scutari and the &s;eraglio, but nearer to the coa&s;t of A&s;ia than that of Europe. It is a very &s;trong place, well fortified, and &s;erves to defend the pa&s;s between the Black and White &s;eas. Why it &s;hould be called <HI>Leander</HI>'s tower, does not appear, &s;ince it was not there, but at the Dardanelles, where <HI>Leander</HI> &s;wam over to &s;ee his mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Hero.</HI></P>
<P>The name which the Europeans give it, would make us believe that they &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been formerly the habitation of <HI>Hero,</HI> but we mu&s;t be very cautious in the&s;e kind of conjectures, to avoid being exceedingly ab&s;urd. Some travellers have placed a Pompey's pillar at the mouth of the Black &s;ea, which was never vi&s;ited by that illu&s;trious Roman. They have called by the &s;ame name another column at Alexandria, which he certainly never erected: and, to return to Con&s;tan|tinople, there is to be &s;een near the Euxine &s;ea, an ancient tower, &s;till remaining among the ruins of &s;everal others of the &s;ame kind, which, built in a line,
<PB N="187" REF="194">
at proper di&s;tances from each other, were formerly u&s;ed to repeat &s;ignals on the approach of the ve&s;&s;els of the Co&s;&s;acks, who had made them&s;elves dreaded by their piracies on the Black &s;ea. This de&s;olate tower wanted a name, in that country of ignorance and barbari&s;m; and our Europeans, who have the oppo&s;ite folly of &s;eeming to know and explain every thing, have called it the tower of <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>
<P>Scutari, though &s;ituated in A&s;ia, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the canal, is generally con&s;idered as making part of the &s;uburbs of this immen&s;e city. It is the rendezvous of the merchants and caravans which come to Con|&s;tantinople from Armenia and Per&s;ia, and is the only con&s;iderable town on the A&s;iatic &s;ide of the Bo&s;phorus.</P>
<P>There is a way from the city of Con&s;tantinople to the &s;uburbs of Galata and Pera by land, in making the tour of the harbour, but then there is the &s;mall river to cro&s;s, which we have noticed before, at the upper end. In going this way, the road lyes over a &s;pacious plain, called the <HI>Ocmeidan,</HI> where the Turks exerci&s;e them&s;elves with their bows and arrows, and where they go in proce&s;&s;ion at the commencement of a war, to implore &s;ucce&s;s on their arms. Near the water-&s;ide is their great ar&s;enal, where the principal officers belonging their marine re&s;ide. The inhabitants of Galata are chiefly &s;upported by the taverns and pub|lic-hou&s;es with which this town abounds, and where
<PB N="188" REF="195">
wine is drunk as cu&s;tomarily as in other cities, &s;trangers not being here under the lea&s;t re&s;traint, either in their mode of living or of wor&s;hip. Even the Turks them|&s;elves will &s;ometimes come here in order to carou&s;e. The private hou&s;es in Pera are much more &s;plendid than tho&s;e within the walls of Con&s;tantinople, and chief|ly tenanted by the Greeks of high rank, as well as by the foreign amba&s;&s;adors. Two of the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors, we &s;hould have ob&s;erved, are privileged to re&s;ide within the walls of the city; tho&s;e from the Emperor and the King of Poland; &s;o that nece&s;&s;ity as well as choice obliges the re&s;t to re&s;ide here. Pera being up|on a prominence overlooks, as it were, Tophana, which is &s;ituated under Pera on the canal oppo&s;ite the &s;eraglio. The hou&s;es of Galata, Pera, and Tophana, are &s;o &s;itua|ted, from their being one higher than the other, that they form a kind of amphitheatre, which commands a plea&s;ant view of the city of Con&s;tantinople, the harbour, and the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In the burial place of the Dervi&s;es at Pera, is the tomb of the famous Count de <HI>Bonneval,</HI> who&s;e debts and extravagances obliged him to leave France, and turn Mahometan. The in&s;cription mentions him <HI>to have been a per&s;on highly e&s;teemed by the Franks, who be&s;ides having had the good fortune to embrace the only true religion, had likewi&s;e the additional happine&s;s to die on the anniver&s;ary of the Prophet.</HI> A proof, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> that the Turki&s;h <HI>beaux e&s;prits</HI> may very ju&s;tly put in their claim for the honour of founding an academy of in&s;criptions.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="196">To avoid being circumci&s;ed, this celebrated charac|ter, in the French annals, had recour&s;e to artifice. He never went to public prayers, not even on Fridays, but kept an Iman in his hou&s;e, whom he u&s;ed to term his father confe&s;&s;or. He dined frequently with the foreign amba&s;&s;adors, where he partook of every thing that was brought to table, without exception; but at home he eat no pork, not drank any wine, and kept the fa&s;t of Ramazan very rigorou&s;ly. He had a French cook in his &s;ervice, and any foreigner of his acquaint|ance, that cho&s;e to dine with him, had only to &s;ay <HI>Pilau,</HI> and a cover was laid for him. To &s;hew what a &s;ingular kind of man he was, we will mention &s;ome <HI>traits</HI> of humour in him, which &s;eem rather puerile, but which will help to form &s;ome idea of the eccentricity of his character. In his <HI>&s;alle &agrave; manger,</HI> there was a prodigious quantity of birds, among other kinds a great many parrots. As &s;oon as the company were a&s;&s;embled, and began to talk, the birds immediately &s;et up their notes, and the parrots in particular, accom|panied them with a noi&s;e that perfectly &s;tunned every one; and this harmonious mu&s;ic u&s;ed to delight the count beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Afterwards, before the din|ner was &s;erved up, he had a very large di&s;h brought to him, full of bits and &s;craps of meat. On a &s;ignal given, all the cats in the neighbourhood were col|lected together, to the number of above three hun|dred; he then threw out the&s;e &s;craps of meat to them, which the cats, in contending for, u&s;ed to fight and
<PB N="190" REF="197">
&s;cratch, and tear one another to pieces. This &s;kirmi&s;h among the cats plea&s;ed him very much. Among them there was one very &s;mall and entirely white, but which, contrary to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom of cats, was very dirty and filthy. The count called this, the king's &s;on.</P>
<P>This extraordinary man was always &s;inging, <HI>Joui&s;&s;ons du pre&s;ent, l'avenir e&s;t des &s;ots, &amp;c.</HI> i. e. <HI>Let us enjoy the time pre&s;ent, and leave futurity to fools.</HI> Ambition was the rock he &s;pilt upon, and made him commit faults which he could never after retrieve. One evening while there was a concert at the amba&s;&s;ador's, he was &s;een in tears. As our fir&s;t ideas, like our fir&s;t habits, pre&s;ent them&s;elves again to our imagination as old age comes upon us, and the pre&s;ent moment no lon|ger occupies our thoughts, &s;o it was with the count; he began at la&s;t to grow tired of his &s;ituation, and to regret his country and his religion. He accordingly wrote to his friends to obtain his pardon. Mea&s;ures were, in con&s;equence, concerted to procure him his liberty, and the Pope was already di&s;po&s;ed to receive this prodigal &s;on again into the bo&s;om of the church, whom nece&s;&s;ity had obliged to abjure his religion. But fate, which &s;o often counteracts the be&s;t concerted plans of mortals, did not permit him to enjoy this happine&s;s: for the gout, to which he was &s;ubject, attacked him afre&s;h in his &s;tomach, and he died. A prie&s;t had been &s;ent to him in di&s;gui&s;e, but the Turks
<PB N="191" REF="198">
finding out who he was, would not &s;uffer him to re|main in the hou&s;e. He died in a kind of tran&s;port, &s;aying, <HI>Quand les cochons &s;ont &s;ortis de l'etable, il faut en fermer la porte;</HI> i. e. <HI>When the pigs have quitted their &s;ty, the door &s;hould be &s;hut.</HI> Which &s;hews, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> that his thoughts were turned towards Chri&s;tianity, for it is well known the Turks do not like this animal, and never keep any of them. He was made a Ba&s;haw of two tails, and had an income from the Porte of 12,000 pia&s;tres a-year.</P>
<P>Tophana, which is the remaining part of the &s;uburbs, has its name from being the foundery of cannon, and artillery, for the Turki&s;h empire, which are all ca&s;t here.</P>
<P>Including the&s;e &s;uburbs, Con&s;tantinople is about thirty miles in circumference; but within the walls it is not calculated to be more than eleven or twelve, exclu&s;ive of the &s;eraglio, which makes an additional three or four miles. There is al&s;o another &s;eraglio, two miles in circumference, called the old &s;eraglio, and which is the re&s;idence of the &s;ultanas belonging to former emperors.</P>
<P>The unequal heights of this city, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> make it &s;eem as large again as it is, though one of the large&s;t cities in the world, &s;hewing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cypre&s;s trees, palaces, mo&s;ques, and
<PB N="192" REF="199">
public buildings, rai&s;ed one above another, with as much beauty and appearance of &s;ymmetry as ever was &s;een in a cabinet adorned by the mo&s;t &s;kilful hands, where jars &s;hew them&s;elves above jars, mixed with cani&s;ters, babies, and candle&s;ticks. This is a very odd compari&s;on, but it gives me, &s;ays her lady&s;hip, an exact idea of the place.</P>
<P>Nothing can be imagined more delightful than the approach to Con&s;tantinople by water. One is in the mid&s;t of three large arms of the &s;ea, of which one comes from the north-ea&s;t, another runs to the north|we&s;t, and the third, formed of the other two, throws it&s;elf into the White &s;ea. The&s;e three arms of the &s;ea wa&s;h as far as one can &s;ee, fields which terminate in little hills, covered with gardens, and villas; and the nearer the&s;e channels approach the city, the more hou&s;es &s;tand upon them, which &s;eem to be rai&s;ed one above the other. Among the&s;e hou&s;es, the fronts of which are painted after various manners, is to be &s;een an incredible number of large domes, cupolas, and minarets, or circular turrets gilt, which overlook the re&s;t of the buildings.</P>
<P>The verdant foliage of the cypre&s;&s;es and other large trees, which are in mo&s;t of the gardens, add very much to the delicious pro&s;pect. The many &s;hips which lye in the harbour, make a &s;pacious circle of trees, who&s;e leaves &s;eem &s;tripped off on purpo&s;e to
<PB N="193" REF="200">
give the &s;pectator a full view of all the beauties that lye behind them. And the prodigious multitude of <HI>Caicks,</HI> gondolas, and other &s;maller wherries, to the number of above 16,000, &s;ome with &s;ails, others with oars, &s;ome on parties of plea&s;ure, and the re&s;t for the nece&s;&s;ary intercour&s;e of the inhabitants; continually repre&s;ents a &s;ort of &s;ea-fight.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, let a per&s;on ca&s;t his eyes in whatever direction, when in the middle of the harbour of this great city, and he will not cea&s;e to admire how much nature has contributed towards the beauty and orna|ment of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>No wonder, therefore, <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> could &s;o ea&s;ily give up the plea&s;ures of Rome, to transfer the &s;eat of his empire to Byzantium, and call it by his own name. There is not in the univer&s;e a city more proper to be the &s;eat of an emperor of the world. It overlooks at once, two of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable di&s;tricts, and in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, orders may be di&s;|patched from Europe, in which it is &s;ituated, into A&s;ia, that &s;eems to approach it &s;o near, in order to be &s;ubject to its laws. And &s;hould art and nature combine to form a &s;ituation where beauty and plenty might meet, they would never &s;ucceed better than in making Con&s;tantinople what it is.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="201">The land produces all kinds of delicious fruits, which can either plea&s;e the eye or gratify the ta&s;te, nor is any thing wanting that conduces either to the comforts and conveniencies, or to the luxuries of life. The water both fre&s;h and &s;alt furni&s;hes every thing that can be required from that u&s;eful element. The air is admirable, and the continual chirping of an infinite number of birds on the trees, in the gar|dens, and upon the cottages, &s;eem to proclaim this climate to be the fine&s;t in the world. The amphi|bious creatures, which live &s;ometimes in the water, &s;ometimes on the land, and &s;ometimes in the air, are very numerous, which would induce one to believe, that the&s;e three elements are here in the highe&s;t de|gree of perfection and temperature.</P>
<P>This prodigality of nature in her gifts, made the Emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> &s;ay, it was better to abandon all the re&s;t of the world to live at Con&s;tantinople, than leave &s;o plea&s;ant a country depopulated, which had been the fate of &s;everal other great cities. On this idea he changed its name into that of the Everla&s;ting city. However, the&s;e were not the only names it has received, having had almo&s;t as many names as ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of the &s;even towers, which joins the&s;e walls, is the fir&s;t building on the land&s;ide, and forms one of the angles of Con&s;tantinople, that catches the eye in approaching it by the Propontis or White &s;ea.
<PB N="195" REF="202">
It was formerly one of the gates of the city, and con|&s;i&s;ted of four large turrets. The ancients called it the gilded gate, either becau&s;e the decorations with which it was adorned, were really gilt, or becau&s;e the public entries were generally made through this gate.</P>
<P>To the four ancient towers of this gate <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. added three new ones, in order to make it &s;trong enough to keep the trea&s;ures of the empire. It is built of free-&s;tone, and environed with a wall and &s;everal &s;maller towers, &s;ome of which in the year 1754 fell into ruins. It is at pre&s;ent u&s;ed as a &s;tate pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The beautiful remains of this gate are &s;till admira|ble, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> though &s;uffered by the Turks to be almo&s;t concealed by a dead wall, and the &s;hade of the neighbouring trees. It is a regular and carved arch of white marble, &s;upported by two beautiful pillars, adorned in the pila&s;ters with a &s;culpture, repre&s;enting &s;everal military atchievements, and flanked on each &s;ide the pillars with twelve tablets of carved work, extremely well performed, containing many poetical &s;tories. Among the re&s;t is that of Hercules and the Nemaean lion; the bea&s;t prodigious and terrible, but confe&s;&s;ing its conqueror by an agreeable po&s;ture; Luna and Endymion; a winged pega&s;us managed by &s;ome of the mu&s;es; a portraiture of the known com|bat of whirlbats, and an imperial figure, crowned by two cele&s;tial machines.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203">This city excels in fine mo&s;ques. The mo&s;t re|markable is that of St. <HI>Sophia.</HI> It was built by the Emperor <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> and afterwards enlarged and beauti|fied by <HI>Ju&s;tinian.</HI> The dedication of it, was to the Divine Wi&s;dom, and for that rea&s;on, it was called <HI>Sophia,</HI> a title which the Turks &s;till retain. This church, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> which is &s;quare without, and round within, is alone worth the trouble of a jour|ney to Con&s;tantinople, to have a view of it. The &s;ituation is very advantageous, being upon an emi|nence, in the fine&s;t part of the town, from whence there is a gradual de&s;cent to the &s;ea. It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;pa|cious court, enriched all round with fair and regular cloi&s;ters formed by pillars, &s;ome of who&s;e &s;hafts are carved with white marble, &s;ome with &s;erpentine &s;tone, and &s;ome with porphyry; but all the capitals are of the modern Turki&s;h figure. Next is the body of the mo&s;que covered outwardly with domes, and &s;upported inwardly with four ma&s;&s;y pillars, from the tops of which ri&s;es a regular cupola, forming the roof of the whole mo&s;que. This dome is not to equalled in the world. It re&s;embles that of St. Peter's at Rome, only of a much greater circumference, and is &s;aid to be one hundred and thirteen feet in diameter, built upon arches, &s;u&s;tained by va&s;t pillars of marble, of which the pavement and &s;tairca&s;e are likewi&s;e marble. It has two rows of galleries by pillars of parti-coloured marble, and the whole roof is of Mo&s;aic work; its
<PB N="197" REF="204">
compo&s;ition a kind of pa&s;te, with which counterfeit jewels are made.</P>
<P>A portico or piazza, thirty-&s;ix feet in breadth, &s;upported by marble columns, extends the whole length of the front: this in the time of the Greek emperors &s;erved for a ve&s;tibulum. This piazza has a communication with the church by nine large fold|ing doors, the leaves of which are bra&s;s, and adorned with bas-reliefs extremely magnificent. The church was painted after the Mo&s;aic manner, with cro&s;&s;es and images of our Saviour, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and other &s;aints, which appear &s;till, though the Turks have defaced the heads of them, &s;uffering no images in their mo&s;ques. There is a tomb in this church, which they imagine to be that of <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> On the day of their <HI>Bairam</HI> or pa&s;&s;over, there are generally above 40,000 per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled in it; at which time there are above &s;even thou&s;and lamps lighted up in the church, be&s;ides above three thou&s;and in the minarets.</P>
<P>The minarets have the appearance of pillars, and are little hollow towers, four or five feet in diameter, ri&s;ing of an equal thickne&s;s from the corner of the mo&s;que, as high as the cupolas, where a gallery, pro|jecting about twenty or thirty inches, communicates with the winding &s;tairca&s;e, leading there by a &s;mall door, always directed ea&s;tward towards Mecca; the
<PB N="198" REF="205">
minaret, then dimini&s;hing about a quarter of its thick|ne&s;s, continues to ri&s;e a fifth or &s;ixth part higher, and ends in a pointed top, covered with lead, and termi|nated by a kind of cre&s;cent; the two extremities of which, curved like &s;pirals, and brought near together, commonly enclo&s;e the name of God cut in metal.</P>
<P>The floor of this and indeed of all the mo&s;ques, is fine marble, and covered with mat, the Mahometans being expre&s;sly enjoined to take off their &s;lippers when they enter them, agreeable to our text of &s;cripture, "Take thy &s;hoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy ground."</P>
<P>Different &s;ultans have built &s;mall chapels round this mo&s;que of St. Sophia, which &s;erve as tombs for them&s;elves and their families; in the&s;e oratories lamps are continually burning, and per&s;ons paid to pray for the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed. The&s;e per&s;ons live there, le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e time in going and returning. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, in order to counter-balance this &s;uper&s;tition, that the cu&s;tom of giving con&s;iderable &s;ums daily to the poor at this mo&s;que, at certain hours, is meritorious and exemplary.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other mo&s;ques, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> which claim the admiration of &s;trangers: the mo&s;que of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> which exceeds that of St. Sophia in dimen&s;ions, and is built of very fine marble brought
<PB N="199" REF="206">
from the ruins of Troy and Chalcedon. The mau|&s;oleum of its founder and his &s;ultana, are placed in one of the chapels; the coffin is covered with fine em|broidery, repre&s;enting the town of Mecca, and at the head is placed his turban, decked with a tuft of herons feathers, and enriched with precious &s;tones. The whole chapel is al&s;o illuminated with an immen&s;e number of lamps, and tapers, kept con&s;tantly burning. Secondly, that of Sultan <HI>Bajazet,</HI> which though le&s;s in circumference than the former, is more to be ad|mired for its ornaments and workman&s;hip. In this mo&s;que on great fe&s;tivals, the Turks are accu&s;tomed to di&s;play the name of the Grand Signor, or &s;ome be|&s;ieged town on the walls with parti-coloured lamps.</P>
<P>At the fe&s;tival of the great <HI>Beiram,</HI> the Grand Sig|nor goes in proce&s;&s;ion to this mo&s;que. The cavalcade which i&s;&s;ues from the &s;eraglio on this occa&s;ion, is one of the fine&s;t &s;ights in Europe, &s;ays Lord <HI>Baltimore;</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts of vizirs, ba&s;haws, and all the great civil and military officers of the empire, who go to pay their re&s;pects to the &s;ultan. They begin to i&s;&s;ue forth from the &s;eraglio at four o'clock in the morning, and the proce&s;&s;ion continues till nine. When the Grand Signor appears, there is a deep &s;ilence every where. The Jani&s;&s;aries line the &s;treet, from the palace to the mo&s;que; they are without arms, and &s;tand with their arms acro&s;s, bowing them&s;elves down only to the Grand Signor and the vizirs, who return their &s;alute.
<PB N="200" REF="207">
I a&s;ked a captain of the Jani&s;&s;aries, &s;ays his lord&s;hip, why they had no arms? "Arms!" &s;aid he, "you infidel; they are for our enemies: we govern our &s;ubjects by the law."</P>
<P>That of Sultan <HI>Solyman,</HI> &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> is an exact &s;quare, with four fine towers in the angles; in the mid&s;t is a noble cupola, &s;upported with beautiful mar|ble pillars; two le&s;&s;er at the ends, &s;upported in the &s;ame manner; the pavement and gallery round the mo&s;que of marble; under the great cupola is a foun|tain adorned with &s;uch fine coloured pillars, that I can hardly think them natural marble; on one &s;ide is the pulpit of white marble, and on the other a little gallery for the Grand Signor. A fine &s;tairca&s;e leads to it, built with gilded lattices. At the upper end is a &s;ort of altar, where the name of God is written; and, before it, &s;tand two candle&s;ticks, as high as a man, with wax candles as thick as three flambeaux. The pavement is &s;pread with fine carpets, and the mo&s;que illuminated with a profu&s;ion of lamps. The court leading to it is very &s;pacious, with galleries of mar|ble with green columns, covered with twenty-eight leaded cupolas on two &s;ides, and a fine fountain in the middle.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription, &s;ays her lady&s;hip, may &s;erve for all the mo&s;ques in Con&s;tantinople. The model is
<PB N="201" REF="208">
exactly the &s;ame, differing only in &s;ize and the thick|ne&s;s of the materials.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing by a mo&s;que, &s;ays <HI>Sertini,</HI> which the pre&s;ent &s;ultan is building, we &s;aw in one of the angles a public fountain, very elegantly decorated, with a great number of beautiful marble columns from Seravezza and Arabia. This fountain is &s;urround|ed with an iron grate or bars, in the in&s;ide of which are a great number of &s;ilver embo&s;&s;ed goblets, and a Turk who &s;tands there to fill them with water for any per&s;on who may wi&s;h to quench his thir&s;t. This &s;er|vice is performed <HI>gratis</HI> to every one, for &s;uch was the will of the founder. The Turks, &s;ays the above author, are naturally inclined to the&s;e acts of public beneficence: there are even &s;ome who will leave lega|cies, as we have before remarked, for the maintenance of cats and dogs; others again, who will lay out their money in purcha&s;ing birds, merely to give them their liberty, by letting them fly.</P>
<P>About &s;ix miles from this city are &s;ome famous aqueducts, built by <HI>Valentinian,</HI> and repaired after|wards by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent. The mo&s;t remark|able of the&s;e forms three great and lofty fabrics, that are built over &s;o many vallies, between the hills, in order, to convey the water from one hill to another, till it reaches the city. The&s;e vallies being very deep,
<PB N="202" REF="209">
and no arch being &s;ufficient to rai&s;e a &s;tructure high enough, one bridge is, as it were, erected upon the back of another, arch over arch, till the top of the bridge is on a level with the mountain, a hill from which the water flows. On this upper bridge, is a canal to convey the &s;tream, and on each &s;ide of the bridge is a colonade, through which foot pa&s;&s;engers can pa&s;s and repa&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e aqueducts which &s;upply Con&s;tantinople with water, often &s;erve for a boundary to the excur&s;ion of the Turks; but it will ea&s;ily be imagined, it is neither to admire the architecture, nor judge of the &s;alubrity of the waters that they go there in crowds. They take great care to carry wine, and every thing with them on which they chu&s;e to regale; and take their po&s;t in &s;ome ruined kio&s;ks, which the emperors built at the &s;ame time with the edifices, intended to collect the rain water, and convey it to the capital.</P>
<P>The&s;e aqueducts, which the Turks have been obliged to &s;ub&s;titute for the ancient ci&s;terns, are &s;o ill-con&s;tructed, that a compari&s;on between them and tho&s;e of the Greeks, mu&s;t make the latter appear a work of great merit. Yet this edifice, built in the time of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> is no ways remarkable, either for the boldne&s;s or the lightne&s;s of its con&s;truction; and &s;till le&s;s &s;o for true ta&s;te. The architect &s;eems to have &s;tudied only to deceive the eye by a number of ma&s;&s;es, which appear as if hanging in the air, re&s;embling in|vented

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Police and the Slaves.</HEAD>
<P>THE guard of the city con&s;i&s;ts of a body of Jani&s;|&s;aries, with their colonel at every gate. In all the frequented parts there is al&s;o another corps, and in each of the &s;treets another party of two or three men, and a patrole, continually going their rounds day and night. The&s;e men are armed only with cudgels, but they manage them &s;o &s;kilfully, as to be dreaded as much as if they had fire-arms. In almo&s;t all the &s;treets, there are likewi&s;e gates which cut off the communication with other &s;treets. Such is the man|ner in which this immen&s;e city is guarded, where murders &s;eldom happen, and where malefactors are almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly di&s;covered on their commi&s;&s;ion of any crime.</P>
<P>If a robbery or an a&s;&s;ault is committed here, all the inhabitants of that &s;treet are doomed to bear a part of the puni&s;hment&mdash;&s;uch is the invariable law. From whence it follows, that every inhabitant exerts him&s;elf &s;trenuou&s;ly in driving out any per&s;on, who begins a di&s;pute, from the &s;treet where he lives. They are al&s;o
<PB N="204" REF="211">
careful that no thief or pickpocket introduces him&s;elf among them; and being all re&s;pon&s;ible for each other, it is very difficult that any crime can be committed with impunity.</P>
<P>This law &s;eems rather &s;evere, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, is very much &s;o: for in&s;tance, if a dead body is thrown up on the &s;ea &s;hore, which has been &s;trangled or mur|dered, the inhabitants of the village neare&s;t to the place where &s;uch dead body is thrown up, are obliged to pay a certain fine, if they do not di&s;cover the parents of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Each quarter has its tribunal where ju&s;tice is ad|mini&s;tered, in which a <HI>Cadi</HI> or judge, attended by his clerks, &s;its the whole day, to hear complaints and ad|mini&s;ter ju&s;tice, which is brought the more &s;peedily to an i&s;&s;ue, becau&s;e the payment of the expences imme|diately follows.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable officers of the civil police is the <HI>Stambo-Effendi,</HI> who&s;e power is &s;imilar, if not &s;uperior to the lord-mayor of London, or the lieu|tenant of police at Paris. This po&s;t is con&s;idered as the fir&s;t &s;tep of a profe&s;&s;or of the law, to tho&s;e great offices of the &s;tate, which are in the nomination of the Grand Signor, without any re&s;pect to &s;eniority of rank. This per&s;on has the in&s;pection of all &s;aleable commo|dities, and particularly of the provi&s;ions of the capital.
<PB N="205" REF="212">
It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to procure an abundance of what|ever is requi&s;ite for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants; and if any particular article begins to get &s;carce, he endeavours to make an equal di&s;tribution of it, accord|ing to circum&s;tances. This po&s;t is always filled by &s;ome per&s;on of con&s;ummate prudence and integrity. It is highly lucrative, as there is not a &s;ingle article or nece&s;&s;ary of life con&s;umed in Con&s;tantinople, from which he does not draw &s;ome revenue.</P>
<P>He fixes the prices of all kinds of commodities, proclaims them publicly, and takes care, either by him&s;elf or his officers, that the weights and mea&s;ures are ju&s;t and hone&s;t. He generally goes round the city once a-month, or oftener, on hor&s;eback, preceded by four Jani&s;&s;aries, dre&s;&s;ed in their habits of cere|mony, with their &s;taves in their hands, with one of his attendants by his &s;ide, holding the &s;cales, whil&s;t another carries the weights, a third the hammer; and the re&s;t who accompany him are provided with cudgels and other weapons, to puni&s;h tho&s;e who are found guilty.</P>
<P>This troop is always preceded by per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e, who unexpectedly &s;eize on the bread of &s;ome &s;hop, or the weights and &s;cales of &s;ome fruit-&s;eller, or vender of any other commodity, that may convict a fraudulent dealer.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="213">The bread is then brought to the magi&s;trate, and put into the &s;cale again&s;t the weights it ought to weigh, whil&s;t the baker, already &s;eized, and in the pre|&s;ence of the judge, is waiting the &s;entence which is to acquit or condemn him to the ba&s;tinado, if not to &s;ome more &s;evere puni&s;hment; &s;uch as having his ear nailed to his &s;hop, or even to be hanged, according to the caprice of his judge. But what is mo&s;t remark|able, is, that the real baker, the proprietor of the oven, he who&s;e knavery &s;hould be puni&s;hed, is not con|cerned in this affair; he quietly pre&s;erves the daily profits of the fal&s;e weight, which incurs puni&s;hment, and leaves to one of his journeymen or the foreman of his &s;hop, all the danger and trouble of this &s;hame|ful practice; who for double pay agrees to per&s;onate his ma&s;ter; and this advantageous po&s;t is immediately &s;olicited by &s;ome other, when the fir&s;t gets hanged; for &s;uch a trifle di&s;courages no one. Puni&s;hments of this &s;ort, however, are by no means &s;o frequently inflicted as they merit.</P>
<P>To the&s;e precautions, intended to in&s;ure hone&s;ty in the &s;ale of provi&s;ions, the government adds the right of fixing the price. But things are not paid the le&s;s for on that account. The multitude is ea&s;ily deceived; they think they have obtained their end, when to remedy the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, the vizir commands them to be &s;old at a lower price; and going out <HI>incognito,</HI> perhaps, orders &s;ome baker's
<PB N="207" REF="214">
journeyman to be hanged. No one enquires on what evidence the wretch was put to death, but every one thinks the bread better.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;ingular &s;o great a contempt for humanity &s;hould be accompanied by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd benevo|lence towards animals the lea&s;t u&s;eful to &s;ociety? While government enforces the mo&s;t rigorous mono|poly of the corn con&s;umed in the capital, by an ex|action ruinous to the cultivator, and a di&s;tribution le&s;s burthen&s;ome to the baker than the con&s;umer, it allows &s;o much per cent. in favour of turtle doves. A cloud of the&s;e birds, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> con&s;tantly alight on tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els which cro&s;s the port of Con|&s;tantinople uncovered, in order to carry the commo|dity to the magazines, or the mills. The boatmen never oppo&s;e their greedine&s;s. This permi&s;&s;ion to feed on the grain, collects them together in great numbers, and familiari&s;es them &s;o much, that I have &s;een them &s;tanding on the &s;houlders of the rowers, watching for a vacant &s;pot where they might fill their crops in their turn.</P>
<P>The Turks are great lovers of order. He who brings his provi&s;ions to market fir&s;t, has the privilege of vending them before tho&s;e who come after him; but then he is not to exact more than a fixed price for them. If he &s;ells any kind of provi&s;ions what|ever, dearer than the price put upon them by the
<PB N="208" REF="215">
proper officer appointed for that purpo&s;e, he is liable to be puni&s;hed. This puni&s;hment is of three kinds, according to the nature of the offence; hanging, the ba&s;tinado, or &s;ome pecuniary fine. The ba&s;tinado is inflicted on the &s;oles of the feet.</P>
<P>The Divan is a tribunal open to every one; to &s;tran|gers as well as natives. A grand council is always held once a-week, on Tue&s;day evening, in the &s;eraglio of the Grand Signor, who is pre&s;ent, without &s;hewing him&s;elf, at a latticed window above the place where the grand vizir &s;its, which is oppo&s;ite the door of the council-room where every one enters. In this man|ner he can hear the debates and the orders given by the grand vizir, and the re&s;t of the mini&s;ters, without being &s;een.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no monarch &s;o acce&s;&s;ible as the Grand Signor. All his &s;ubjects indi&s;criminately, Mahometans, Chri&s;tians, and Jews, may pre&s;ent him a petition every Friday as he goes publickly to the mo&s;que. The form u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, is &s;ingu|lar, and merits being de&s;cribed: Tho&s;e who imagine them&s;elves aggrieved, and determine on preferring a complaint immediately to the &s;ultan, range them&s;elves in a line in the &s;quare fronting the great gate of the &s;eraglio.

<P>In their courts of judicature, there have &s;ometimes been bold and re&s;olute pleaders, who &s;eeing or &s;u|&s;pecting &s;ome prevarication in the judges, have had courage to cry out in open court, <HI>Ha&s;&s;ir yakarum,</HI> "I will light up the match."</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the grand vizir are the two chief ju&s;tices of Romania and Natolia, and the re&s;t of the judges, according to their re&s;pective rank; but the&s;e are not &s;eated. No advocate is employed in any &s;uit; every one pleads his own cau&s;e. When a memorial is pre&s;ented to the grand vizir, if the reque&s;t it con|tains be granted, he &s;igns it with his name; but if it is refu&s;ed, he tears the memorial in pieces, and there the matter ends. All cau&s;es are decided very expe|ditiou&s;ly, becau&s;e in general they depend upon <HI>viva voce</HI> evidence; but if any cau&s;e &s;hould be at all in|tricate, the grand vizir refers the in&s;pection of it to &s;ome officer under him, and directs him to make his report upon it within a limited time.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">Every thing relative to religion and the morals of the people, the grand vizir leaves to the deci&s;ion of the two chief ju&s;tices without appeal. Mondays and Fridays are vacation days; but on all other days the divan is open either at the &s;eraglio, or at the grand vizir's. Nothing is more a&s;toni&s;hing, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> than to &s;ee a grand vizir, who has, oftentimes, had &s;carce any education, direct &s;o va&s;t an empire as the Ottoman, and govern it perfectly well.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>C.</HI> relates, that while &s;he was at Con&s;tanti|nople, the captain pacha introduced a lion into the divan, which he had taught to follow him about like a dog; but the mini&s;ters were &s;o terrified, that &s;ome of them jumped out of the windows, and one of them was very near breaking his neck in flying down &s;tairs; and the high admiral and his lion were left to &s;ettle the councils of the day together.</P>
<P>Great mi&s;repre&s;entations having been made re|&s;pecting the &s;tate of &s;lavery in the Ottoman empire, we &s;hall take this opportunity, though it does not come immediately under the article of police, of removing an odium from a condition of life, which by the de|grading appellation given to it, has induced men to believe that &s;laves in general lead a life of &s;orrow, pain, and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="218">The &s;laves who &s;uffer hard&s;hips in Turkey, are either criminals &s;ent to the gallies, or pri&s;oners taken at &s;ea by the Ottoman cor&s;airs; the government &s;ends out two or three zebecks in a year, more to keep up an ancient cu&s;tom than with the view of taking pri&s;oners. The commanders have &s;trict orders to attack none but Malte&s;e ve&s;&s;els; and if they take any of the inhabitants of that i&s;land, they are brought in triumph to Con&s;tantinople, amid&s;t the acclamma|tions of the Turks, and are &s;ent on board the row gallies to hard labour, being chained to the oars. The number of galley-&s;laves is likewi&s;e increa&s;ed, by tho&s;e &s;ent annually from the &s;tates of Barbary to the Grand Signor, among&s;t whom there are &s;ubjects of almo&s;t every European nation; but the major part of them are Neapolitans, Genoe&s;e, and Spaniards. Among tho&s;e &s;ent by the Tuni&s;ians a few years &s;ince, was a grandee of Spain, who was known at Con&s;tan|tinople by his dignity of deportment and &s;olemn gravity; for &s;ome private rea&s;ons, his friends would not ran&s;om him, and no foreign protection could &s;ave him from the gallies, where he worked &s;everal years; however, on a peace with Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;ome per&s;ons found means to intere&s;t Prince <HI>Repnin</HI> in his favour, and he was relea&s;ed; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed the change of air, and a different mode of life, hurt his con&s;titution, for he died at an inn on the road as he was returning to Spain.

and other Greek &s;ettlements, in their infancy. The &s;ervitude of the&s;e is not &s;evere, for the merchants clothe them well, and feed them with the be&s;t provi|&s;ions that they may &s;ell them, to the greate&s;t advantage. A hand&s;ome girl is &s;old to &s;ome Turki&s;h lord, who treats her according to her beauty and good behavi|our; &s;he may or may not chance to be his concubine, and by good fortune &s;he may be his wife. As to the boys they are &s;old to ma&s;ters, who in&s;truct them in &s;uch accompli&s;hments as are proper for young Turki&s;h gentlemen; they are genteelly cloathed, well fed, and &s;leep upon excellent beds; their whole &s;ervice con|&s;i&s;ts in waiting in the antichambers to carry in pipes, coffee, &s;weetmeats, &amp;c. to their ma&s;ters, and in taking care to keep the apartments and the wardrobe in order. If they are faithful and good mu&s;&s;ulmen, they generally marry their ma&s;ter's daughter. By this channel they ri&s;e in the &s;tate, e&s;pecially if they are di&s;tingui&s;hed for per&s;onal valour; and at this pre&s;ent time, mo&s;t of the ba&s;haws of provinces, and great officers of the Porte, have originally been &s;laves.</P>
<P>A third &s;ort of &s;laves in Turkey, are pri&s;oners taken in time of war. In the late war with Ru&s;&s;ia, all the pri&s;oners taken by the Turks were &s;old as &s;laves. They took a great quantity from different countries, who were all confounded under the name of Ru&s;&s;ians, becau&s;e they were not mu&s;&s;ulmen. One of the articles of the peace &s;tipulated, that all the pri&s;oners of war
<PB N="213" REF="220">
&s;hould be relea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The individuals among the Turks, who had bought great numbers of Ru&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners, were very much embarra&s;&s;ed by this article, but they relied on the difficulty of their being di&s;covered by the Ru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador, as they were concealed in their hou&s;es, and di&s;per&s;ed all over the Turki&s;h empire.</P>
<P>An intrepid little man, however, a Georgian by birth, named <HI>Sergio,</HI> undertook the difficult ta&s;k of being agent for the Ru&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners at Con&s;tanti|nople. Armed with the <HI>Firman</HI> of the Grand Signor, he went about in &s;earch of Ru&s;&s;ian &s;laves, and took away by force even tho&s;e who had embraced the Mahometan religion. Among&s;t the re&s;t was a Ru&s;&s;ian girl, who had been taken pri&s;oner during the war, and having been brought to Con&s;tantinople, was &s;old to a &s;cherif of the race of Emirs, who had married her. The hu&s;band enraged at the preten&s;ions of <HI>Sergio,</HI> turned him out of doors, and was on the point of caning him; but the undaunted <HI>Sergio</HI> in&s;tantly repaired to the vizir, to whom he &s;hewed the Grand Signor's man|date, which allowed no exceptions of religion or &s;itua|tion; the vizir was very much perplexed, but at length replied, if the woman per&s;i&s;ted in being a Mahometan, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to recover her; but if &s;he would voluntarily turn Chri&s;tian again, the Emir mu&s;t give her up. Her hu&s;band was very rich and very fond of her; he therefore made no doubt &s;he would
<PB N="214" REF="221">
remain firm in the Mahometan faith. This confi|dence made him readily obey the &s;ummons of the vizir to attend him at the divan, and bring his wife with him, to an&s;wer the claim of <HI>Sergio.</HI> Being come before him, the vizir a&s;ked her if &s;he would remain a Maho|metan, or return back to her old religion; &s;he replied, &s;he would live and die a Chri&s;tian. The vizir on this, decreed that <HI>Sergio</HI> &s;hould take away the woman: the hu&s;band was quite di&s;tracted, and the more &s;o as his wife was with child. As his la&s;t re&s;ource, he in&s;i&s;ted the child &s;hould not be removed out of the Ottoman empire, "For it is mine, &s;aid he, and belongs to the &s;acred family of Mahomet, wearing green turbans." <HI>Sergio</HI> had the courage to reply in full divan&mdash;"If the child is born with a green rag upon his head, it will be a certain proof that it is a de&s;cendant from Mahomet; if not, Mahomet has nothing to do with it, and it belongs to Chri&s;t." There was no &s;tanding the force of this argument, and the woman was given up, and &s;ent to her Ru&s;&s;ian friends.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sergio</HI> made all the Turks tremble, and they dreaded him much more than they did Prince <HI>Repnin;</HI> though before he arrived at Con&s;tantinople, they thought of nothing le&s;s, than that he was coming to &s;wallow up the city, and enforce every article of the peace with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="222">Their apprehen&s;ions of his excellency aro&s;e from an extraordinary incident that happpened at Adria|nople. By the preliminary articles of peace, it was agreed, that the Ru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador, who &s;hould be &s;ent to Con&s;tantinople to conclude the definitive treaty of peace, &s;hould have a certain number of troops in his &s;uite, and that they &s;hould be allowed to pa&s;s through the towns and cities of the Ottoman empire &s;word in hand. In con&s;equence of this &s;tipu|lation, Prince <HI>Repnin</HI> and his attendants, marched into Adrianople in this manner: it &s;truck the Jani&s;&s;aries that this was the etiquette of conquerors; they con|&s;idered it as a national affront, and flew to arms; the Ru&s;&s;ians were not to be intimidated, and fought their way through the Jani&s;&s;aries, though greatly inferior in numbers; &s;everal of them were killed in the &s;kir|mi&s;h, and two or three of the Ru&s;&s;ians; after which the prince continued his journey to Con&s;tantinople, but &s;ent a courier to inform the Porte of what had happened. The vizir was in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and hardly knew how to impart this humiliating in|telligence to the Grand Signor; at length, however, a &s;ecret council was held, the re&s;ult of which was, that the vizir and the aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries &s;et off private|ly for Daud Bacha, a plea&s;ant village, where it is u&s;ual for the foreign amba&s;&s;adors extraordinary, to &s;top a little, in order to adju&s;t the formalities of their en|trance into Con&s;tantinople, as it is only a few miles di&s;tant. But the negociation could not be kept &s;ecret;
<PB N="216" REF="223">
the Jani&s;&s;aries at Adrianople had contrived to &s;end information of the in&s;ult, as they termed it, to the Jani&s;&s;aries at Con&s;tantinople, who vowed vengeance again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, if the prince &s;hould attempt to enter the capital &s;word in hand. The arrangement of this delicate affair took up &s;everal days. In the end, a medium was re&s;olved upon, which &s;atisfied both parties. The Porte, however, i&s;&s;ued &s;trict orders that no per&s;on &s;hould be in the &s;treets when the amba&s;&s;a|dor make his entry, intending thereby to avoid the expo&s;ure of the imbecillity of government in &s;uffering &s;uch an article to be in&s;erted in the preliminaries; and the meanne&s;s of evading it in part by the following modification: It had been &s;ettled between the prince and the vizir, that the former, in con&s;ideration of a few pur&s;es &s;hould enter the city with his &s;word only half drawn out of his &s;cabbard, and that his &s;oldiers &s;hould ob&s;erve the &s;ame formality with their &s;abres.</P>
<P>In this manner the proce&s;&s;ion, which was very &s;plendid, pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of Con&s;tantinople, crowded with people of all ranks, notwith&s;tanding the prohibition. As for the Jani&s;&s;aries, they were &s;atis|fied with having humbled the pride of the Ru&s;&s;ians; and the amba&s;&s;ador, like mo&s;t other amba&s;&s;adors, made the glory of his nation give way to his private intere&s;t. This entry likewi&s;e changed the &s;entiments of the Turks re&s;pecting him; for when they &s;aw him in the mid&s;t of his &s;plendid and numerous retinue, and upon

I &s;aw forty-three women lodged very mi&s;erably in three chambers, with only &s;traw to lye on; to whom his excellency allowed only the &s;ixteenth part of a pia&s;tre, or five paras a-day; for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The con&s;equence was, that the greater part of the&s;e poor women &s;tole away to the Turks, and eighty-one per&s;ons of his excellen|cy's retinue de&s;erted from him, and embraced the Ma|hometan religion.</P>
<P>However, &s;uch was the dread of the Turki&s;h govern|ment, le&s;t any fre&s;h mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;hould happen between the two courts, that when Prince <HI>Repnin</HI> was on the point of returning home, the Porte, adds <HI>H.</HI>

offered to re&s;tore him all the Ru&s;&s;ians who had quitted his &s;ervice, which was an infraction of their laws; for having embraced the Mahometan religion, they were become Turki&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The number of black and white &s;laves brought yearly to Con&s;tantinople, is &s;aid to amount to near 20,000. None but Turks are allowed to purcha&s;e any, under the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties. The &s;lave|market is in the middle of the city. It forms a quad|rangle, &s;urrounded with apartments for white &s;laves, and in the area underneath, &s;it the black ones almo&s;t naked. The white female &s;laves are dre&s;&s;ed up in very gaudy colours when they are expo&s;ed for &s;ale, and &s;ome of them fetch a great price, and are very proud of it. They are by no means unhappy; from being next to &s;avages they are well fed, well dre&s;&s;ed, and treated with great urbanity. They are taught a variety of things, get into good families, women as well as men, and oftentimes acquire great riches.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their being in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, many &s;ituations in life, &s;ays Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> are much more &s;o.

<P>It may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome idea here of the Georgian and Circa&s;&s;ian &s;laves, who&s;e beauty is &s;o much celebrated.

The&s;e Tartars carry over to the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the Black &s;ea, the &s;laves they have taken, and &s;ell them to the Turki&s;h merchants, who come thither at certain times.

She replied with vulgar &s;implici|ty, &s;he believed it was, becau&s;e &s;he felt a certain pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, which &s;he u&s;ually experienced about break of day.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Court, Seraglio, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult to form a ju&s;t idea of the Ottoman empire, without being previou&s;ly made acquainted with what is meant by the SERAGLIO and the PORTE; they having both &s;o intimate a connexion with the go|vernment, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand them thoroughly, to comprehend the &s;y&s;tem of Turki&s;h policy.</P>
<P>When the Turks &s;peak of the &s;eraglio, they do not mean the apartments in which the Grand Signor's women are confined, as we are &s;o apt to limit the meaning of the word, but the whole inclo&s;ure of the palace in which the Ottoman monarch re&s;ides, toge|ther with his hou&s;ehold; that is to &s;ay, all the officers, guards, women, and &s;laves employed in his immediate &s;ervice. The extent of this va&s;t inclo&s;ure might very well &s;uffice for a moderate town; it entirely occupies the ground upon which the ancient city of <HI>Byzantium</HI> &s;tood, that is to &s;ay, one of the &s;even hills on which Con&s;tantinople is built. Its circumference is very near &s;ix Engli&s;h miles; there are nine courts within it, mo&s;t of them large quadrangles; the buildings have never been exactly numbered, as no per&s;on is per|mitted to take down an exact account of them; but
<PB N="223" REF="230">
the number is almo&s;t incredible, and they are mo&s;t part of brick; but the kitchens and what is called the trea|&s;ury are very &s;uperb, and built of &s;tone or marble: the whole is covered with lead, and the domes and turrets are ornamented with gilt cre&s;cents. The arch which &s;urrounds the &s;eraglio, is thirty feet high, with battlements, embra&s;ures, and towers, in the &s;tyle of ancient fortifications. It is called the new &s;eraglio, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the old one, built by <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> It is &s;ituated oppo&s;ite to Scutari, except one part, which is at the very entrance of the harbour, and faces the ar&s;enal at Pera. On this &s;ide, at a &s;mall di&s;tance upon, the &s;ea &s;hore, there is a <HI>Kio&s;ch,</HI> or &s;ummer-hou&s;e, for the recreation of the Grand Signor iti &s;ultry weather. It is an irregular building, of about &s;ixty feet in cir|cumference, and twenty in height, con&s;i&s;ting of one large &s;aloon, very magnificently furni&s;hed, and having a &s;eat of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, &s;o placed, that the monarch can have a view from both &s;ides of the hall, as well as from the door.</P>
<P>There are nine gates to the &s;eraglio, but only two of them can be called magnificent; the fir&s;t is the en|trance from the &s;quare of St. Sophia; this gate is very &s;uperb, and will be frequently mentioned hereafter, as it is from this <HI>Porte</HI> or gate, that the Ottoman court takes the name of the Porte, or the Sublime Porte, in all public tran&s;actions and records. On one &s;ide of this gate may be &s;een the pyramids of heads
<PB N="224" REF="231">
that have been cut off, with labels denoting the crimes of the owners, fa&s;tened upon the &s;culls. The &s;econd gate leads to the fir&s;t interior court, and is &s;upported by marble pillars, but it is not &s;o &s;tately and magnificent as the fir&s;t. The re&s;t are not worth notice, except a little gate on the &s;ide next Scutari, through which the grand vizirs are let out privately, when they are &s;ent into exile, and at &s;uch times they have generally a large barge ready to convey them away without being &s;een.</P>
<P>A per&s;on may walk all round the wall that &s;urrounds the &s;eraglio. In that part which rather leans over the &s;ea, facing the ar&s;enal, there are two chambers with three latticed windows, where the Grand Signor frequently places him&s;elf, and hears what the pa&s;&s;engers &s;ay as they go along, without being &s;een.</P>
<P>There is an Arabic in&s;cription over the great gate in gold and azure, &s;ignifying that that gate, and the palace of the &s;eraglio, were built by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. The guards who do duty here have no other arms but a &s;mall &s;taff, which they carry in their hands. Even the Jani&s;&s;aries them&s;elves are &s;eldom &s;een with any offen&s;ive weapons, and ridicule the Franks for wearing &s;words as part of their dre&s;s, a&s;king them if they mean to attack the dogs with them, by which they are &s;ometimes pur&s;ued in troops, and forced to draw in their defence. This circum&s;tance is attri|buted to the novelty of their dre&s;s. But to return to
<PB N="225" REF="232">
the &s;eraglio; through this gate we enter the fir&s;t court, which is open to every one. Here &s;tands the in|firmary, in which people are &s;o well attended and taken care of, that they will frequently, it is &s;aid, counterfeit &s;ickne&s;s to get admittance. They have, likewi&s;e, the privilege of drinking wine in all the Turki&s;h ho&s;pitals, and this is another inducement: wine being con&s;idered by the Turks as a kind of medicine.</P>
<P>On the left &s;ide of this court &s;tands an old building with a cupola, that was formerly a Greek church, in which their armour and trophies are depo&s;ited. In this &s;quare are al&s;o the mint, and apartments on both &s;ides, for the inferior &s;ervants of the &s;eraglio. The &s;econd court, into which any per&s;on may enter, is occupied by the court of the Divan. The walls are paved with marble, and there are &s;everal large gra&s;s plats in it, &s;urrounded with trees and fountains in the middle. All round this court there is a piazza of no great height, but not ill built, &s;upported by a great number of marble pillars. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide is the <HI>A&s;na</HI> or trea&s;ury, and the &s;tables, in which are &s;ome of the fine&s;t hor&s;es in the world, kept purpo&s;ely for the Grand Signor's own riding. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any thing more &s;plendid and brilliant than the bridles, &s;addles, hou&s;ing, and other furniture, with which the hor&s;es are equipped on any public occa|&s;ion, being enriched with precious &s;tones and reful|gent
<PB N="226" REF="233">
with gold, &s;ilver, and other ornaments. But neither the trea&s;ury or &s;tables, where this rich furni|ture is depo&s;ited, have any thing very magnificent in their architecture.</P>
<P>The kitchens are al&s;o on the left hand of this court, which contain &s;everal large hand&s;ome buildings, with cupolas over them, but with no chimnies, holes being made in the cupola to let out the &s;moke; for the hearth is always in the middle of the room, as u&s;ed to be the cu&s;tom in our great halls, and is &s;till &s;o in our colleges and inns of court.</P>
<P>No per&s;on but the Grand Signor, is allowed to ride through the &s;econd court; and there is &s;uch an univer&s;al &s;ilence ob&s;erved through the palace, that notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e number of people who re&s;ort to it, there is not the lea&s;t appearance of noi&s;e and bu&s;tle, but every thing is as hu&s;hed and &s;till as if no per&s;on lived in the &s;eraglio; and the conver&s;ing by &s;igns, contributes to this not a little; for if any per&s;on wi&s;hes to advance him&s;elf at court, he mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf to &s;uch &s;ort of conver&s;ation, and which the Grand Signor is &s;aid to under&s;tand extremely well.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the upper court is the divan, in which the councils of &s;tate are held, and where ju&s;tice is likewi&s;e admini&s;tered. And beyond this court no &s;trangers are admitted, except amba&s;&s;adors, who pa&s;s
<PB N="227" REF="234">
on to the hall of audience where the Grand Signor's throne is erected, and which is encircled with pearls and precious &s;tones. This room is very magnificently furni&s;hed; its roof and &s;ides glitter with gold and azure, be&s;ides being adorned with very fine paintings, after the Per&s;ian manner.</P>
<P>Some travellers, it is &s;aid, have found means of vi&s;iting the more interior parts of the &s;eraglio, and among others, one who attended a clock-maker that had been ordered to repair &s;ome of the curious clocks which had been pre&s;ented to the Grand Signor. They were conducted by a black eunuch into the hall of the haram, where there was an Engli&s;h clock out of order. The whole hall, &s;ays this traveller, was lined with China tiles, and the cieling of the cupola adorned with azure and gold. In the middle of the hall was a fountain, the ba&s;on of which was of fine green marble, having the appearance of Ja&s;per.</P>
<P>The&s;e artificial fountains are very frequent in the Turki&s;h apartments, and &s;erve for the ablutions which precede their prayers, as well as to entertain the eye; e&s;pecially in the harams of the women, who never go into their mo&s;ques without having the Alcoran pre|viou&s;ly read to them, in &s;uch places as the&s;e, which &s;erve as &s;o many chapels. The&s;e halls have large windows, which are not only glazed, but they have, likewi&s;e, bars or lattices before them, and &s;ophas all
<PB N="228" REF="235">
round the room, or elevated wide &s;eats covered with rich carpets, where the ladies &s;it and amu&s;e them&s;elves with viewing the gardens, and enjoy the refre&s;hing breezes which are occa&s;ionally wa&s;ted into them from the Propontis.</P>
<P>From this hall, our traveller was conducted through &s;everal little rooms, like the cells of monks, only ex|celling them very much in the richne&s;s of the furniture; particularly in one, where there was a fine pendulum that wanted putting to rights. The clock &s;tood on a ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver table before a looking gla&s;s, the frame of which was &s;ilver, gilt, and curiou&s;ly carved, and embel|li&s;hed with foilage in bas-relief. Two lofty &s;tands of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver &s;tood on each end of a rich &s;opha, which had a covering of plain green &s;ilk, under which, on its being uncovered, there appeared a very rich brocade with a gold ground, the cu&s;hions being of green velvet very richly worked. This chamber was adorned more than the hall, with paintings and orna|ments; but the lowe&s;t part of the window frames were higher than the talle&s;t man could reach; the gla&s;s was likewi&s;e painted, but without any living creature re|pre&s;ented upon it. On his return back he was led through &s;everal fine halls and chambers, the floors of which were covered with rich Per&s;ian carpets, and the rooms ornamented with fine &s;ophas and gilded cielings. The gardens he went through, were full of groves of cypre&s;s trees and different kinds of evergreens,
<PB N="229" REF="236">
planted without any order or regularity. About twenty yards from the &s;tairca&s;e, leading into the gar|dens, was a pillar of granite marble. It con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;ingle &s;haft, larger in circumference, and about one third higher than <HI>Marcian</HI>'s pillar, and &s;tood upon a &s;quare pede&s;tal, adorned with &s;ome mutilated fe&s;|toons and Latin in&s;criptions; but they were &s;o defaced, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any thing upon them but the name of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> it being dangerous to &s;top long enough to copy any of the in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The&s;e gardens, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> are wild and unculti|vated, affording nothing plea&s;ing to the eye, but what nature has furni&s;hed them with; an admirable &s;ituation ri&s;ing into convenient a&s;cents, and capable of infinite improvement, if they were in the hands of any Chri&s;|tian prince. The whole plat of ground, called the gardens of the &s;eraglio, is &s;o covered with cypre&s;s and other trees, as to re&s;emble a grove, through which &s;hady walks are cut, where plea&s;ure-hou&s;es of various &s;orts are &s;een; the mo&s;t eminent and remarkable of which is that called the Blue Kio&s;h, fronting the town of Scutari.</P>
<P>In the &s;ides of one of the kio&s;hs are three orbicular &s;tones of fine porphyry, the middlemo&s;t of which is curiou&s;ly poli&s;hed, and &s;erves to reflect the pro&s;pect of the &s;eraglio and adjoining city, like a looking-gla&s;s. At the farther end of the&s;e gardens are the entire
<PB N="230" REF="237">
walls of an ancient Chri&s;tian church, and near it the Grand Signor's aviary, where are kept the hens of Grand Cairo, that are remarkable for having blue gills and feathers, curiou&s;ly coloured with grey circles, and in the centre of each circle a &s;pot of black.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above buildings, there are many others in which the inferior officers re&s;ide, and where all the provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;eraglio are depo|&s;ited; particularly on the left hand of the entrance quite down to the water &s;ide, there are prodigious piles of wood, which &s;ome thou&s;ands of <HI>Baltagis</HI> or wood cleavers are continually employed in cutting into billets, and carrying to the different apartments. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide is a large &s;quare, where tho&s;e who are intended for military employments are taught their exerci&s;es, at which the &s;ultan is &s;ometimes pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The number of per&s;ons inhabiting this immen&s;e pile of building, is in proportion to its &s;ize. On the be&s;t authority, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> that of per&s;onal knowledge, I can &s;ay that nearly 10,000 per&s;ons con&s;tantly re&s;ide in it. The grooms and tho&s;e who con&s;titute the corps of guards, make the major part of that number.</P>

<P>This is the number of per&s;ons who u&s;ually re&s;ide in the &s;eraglio, except that of the women, which is increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed according to the ta&s;te of the reigning &s;ultan.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions in the &s;eraglio are dre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch of the agliam-oglams as are brought up to cookery. They begin their bu&s;ine&s;s early in the morning, for the Grand Signor ri&s;ing early, there mu&s;t always be &s;omething ready for his breakfa&s;t. His dinner hour is ten o'clock in the morning, and he &s;ups at &s;ix in the afternoon, both &s;ummer and winter. His manner of &s;itting down to table, is with his legs acro&s;s, after
<PB N="232" REF="239">
the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, with a rich embroidered napkin &s;pread before him. He carves for him&s;elf, but u&s;es neither knife nor fork, his meat being &s;o tender and delicately dre&s;&s;ed, that he ea&s;ily pulls it in pieces with his fingers. He makes u&s;e of two wooden &s;poons; with one he takes his &s;oups, and with the other his &s;yrups. Dinner or &s;upper over, he wa&s;hes his hands in a gold ba&s;on &s;et with precious &s;tones. He &s;carce ever &s;peaks at table, except to &s;ome favourite aga, to whom he &s;ometimes throws a loaf as a mark of favour.</P>
<P>The queen and &s;ultanas are &s;erved at the &s;ame time, but in copper di&s;hes, except the &s;ultan be with them. Their food may truly be &s;aid to come from far. Their &s;herbet is made of &s;now water, brought to Con&s;tanti|nople at a very great expence, and kept under ground. Their only chee&s;e is Parme&s;an furni&s;hed from Venice. The bread is made of wheat brought from Bur&s;a, reckoned very white and &s;avoury; the re&s;t comes from Greece. Their rice, lentils, and other pul&s;e, are the produce of Egypt. Great quantities of &s;ugar are u&s;ed in &s;herbets, but they eat very little &s;pice except pepper. The honey &s;erved up at the &s;ultan's table comes from Chio, but the re&s;t from Walachia and Moldavia. Their oil is had from Greece, but that which the Grand Signor eats comes from Candia and Zant. Their butter comes from the borders of the Black &s;ea and the Crimea. They eat &s;carce any butter or milk, except it be in clouted cream. Very little fi&s;h is eaten at Con&s;tan|tinople
<PB N="233" REF="240">
by the Turks, though the &s;ea yields great plenty, and therefore the Chri&s;tians purcha&s;e it very cheap. The &s;eraglio is plentifully &s;upplied with fruit from the &s;ultan's garden; and as large pre&s;ents are frequently made to him, a great deal of it is &s;old, and the money given to the Grand Signor for his pocket-money. The uten&s;ils of the &s;ultan's kitchens are of bra&s;s, but kept &s;o clean and bright as to do the eye good.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the individuals who com|po&s;e this immen&s;e hou&s;ehold are mo&s;t of them born of Chri&s;tian parents, who have been made captives in time of war, or &s;tolen at a very early age in time of peace. It being a maxim with the Ottoman empire, to be &s;erved only by per&s;ons who are unacquainted with their native country, their parents, or their reli|gion; they being the more likely to be attached to the prince, by whom they are protected and well taken care of.</P>
<P>When one of the&s;e children is pre&s;ented to the &s;eraglio, they fir&s;t examine very minutely if he has any corporeal defect; if &s;o, he is not accepted, though his countenance &s;hould &s;peak very much in his favour; the Mahometans believing that a brave mind can|not exi&s;t in a body materially deformed. But on the contrary, if they meet with &s;uch a per&s;on as they wi&s;h for, they write down his name, and the country he comes from, in a regi&s;ter which remains in the
<PB N="234" REF="241">
chancery of the private trea&s;ury of the Grand Signor, and give the trea&s;urer an order to pay him his daily pen&s;ion, which is four a&s;pers a-day. He is then &s;ent to be educated in one of the old &s;eraglios, either of Pera or Con&s;tantinople. Here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that there is a &s;eraglio at Pera, to which the Grand Signor goes two or three times a-year to &s;pend the day; and it is chiefly in this edifice, that tho&s;e &s;laves who are de&s;tined for his per&s;onal &s;ervice are brought up. Tho&s;e that remain in the &s;eraglio of Con&s;tantinople for their education, are principally tho&s;e who are rai&s;ed to po&s;ts and dignities of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, after having gone through the u&s;ual exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>Such was the cu&s;tom when the Turki&s;h conque&s;ts furni&s;hed a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e children as &s;ub&s;titutes to tho&s;e who were promoted to other em|ployments. But as at pre&s;ent the Chri&s;tians are more careful to guard their children from the rapacious hands of the Turki&s;h emi&s;&s;aries, this &s;ource for &s;laves has failed, and they are obliged to confine their an|cient cu&s;tom of furni&s;hing the &s;eraglio with Chri&s;tian &s;laves to pages only. Tho&s;e Chri&s;tian princes who formerly pre&s;ented a certain number of boys and girls, as an annual tribute for the &s;ervice of the Grand Signor, have refu&s;ed to pay this tribute any longer. Prince <HI>Heraclius,</HI> who governs Georgia &s;o admirably, &s;hook off this inhuman tribute during the late war
<PB N="235" REF="242">
between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians; and &s;ince that time, none but the pages are children of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>We will now relate the manner in which the &s;e|raglio is guarded; it being well known that it is watched very &s;trictly. The whole circuit is confined to the care of the <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> or gardeners, who form the fir&s;t guard: the &s;econd is compo&s;ed of the <HI>Baltagis,</HI> or of tho&s;e who are employed in furni&s;hing the firing for the &s;eraglio, the&s;e are armed with an axe; to them &s;ucceed the guard of the white eunuchs; and the fourth and la&s;t corps are the black eunuchs, who are neare&s;t the per&s;on of the monarch.</P>
<P>The number of 3,500 per&s;ons which are employed for the &s;ervice of the &s;tables, will at fir&s;t &s;eem very great; but if the great quantity of hor&s;es to be taken care of is con&s;idered, our &s;urprize will in&s;tantly vani&s;h. The&s;e hor&s;es, which belong particularly to the monarch, and which no other per&s;on mu&s;t mount, are in num|ber 3,000, which number can neither be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed: &s;uch being the law or cu&s;tom. Whenever a good hor&s;e is pre&s;ented for the per&s;onal &s;ervice of the Grand Signor, and is accepted, they part with that which is of the lea&s;t value: and when a hor&s;e dies or lo&s;es any of his good qualities, he is parted with, and another immediately purcha&s;ed in his room; by this means the fixed number of three thou&s;and is always kept up. The&s;e hor&s;es are all procured either from
<PB N="236" REF="243">
Arabia or Egypt, as being in much greater e&s;timation than tho&s;e in Natolia or Romania.</P>
<P>In order to in&s;ure the be&s;t hor&s;es for the &s;ervice of the Grand Signor, there is an old law enjoining, under pain of death, that all per&s;ons who bring any hor&s;es to Con&s;tantinople, with a view to di&s;po&s;e of them, &s;hall fir&s;t make an offer of &s;uch hor&s;es to the equeries of the &s;eraglio.</P>
<P>All the hor&s;es are divided into three &s;eparate &s;tables; the fir&s;t contains 1,800, the &s;econd 700, and the third 500. There are al&s;o 400 mules in another &s;table, kept for tran&s;porting the &s;ultan's baggage and that of his &s;uite, when he goes into the country. Such a number of mules is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as there are no waggons in Turkey.</P>
<P>To the number of hor&s;es which more particularly belong to the Grand Signor, mu&s;t be added tho&s;e that belong to the principal officers of the &s;eraglio, which are very numerous. The <HI>Ki&s;lar-Aga,</HI> or chief of the black eunuchs, has 300 for his own private u&s;e, and the re&s;t of the mini&s;ters in proportion. Even the pages have each of them no le&s;s than three hor&s;es. We may therefore reckon, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> without the lea&s;t exaggeration, that there are 6000 hor&s;es in the Grand Signor's &s;tables.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="244">This number, it is true, would not require 3,500 per&s;ons to look after them; but as the&s;e men are obli|ged to go and come different ways, and have like|wi&s;e to take care of them&s;elves, as well as their hor&s;es, &s;uch a number &s;eems indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The environs of this place, &s;ays <HI>Se&s;tini,</HI> are very mountainous, and the vallies full of pa&s;tures for the hor&s;es and mules of the Grand Signor's &s;tables. The&s;e hor&s;es, which come chiefly from Arabia, are &s;ome of the fine&s;t that the world can produce. The grooms for the mo&s;t part are Tartars, Bulgarians, or Arabians. They live under tents during the time that the mules and hor&s;es are ordered to remain out at gra&s;s, which gives a very picture&s;que view to the country round.</P>
<P>The day that the&s;e hor&s;es are fir&s;t brought to gra&s;s, the groom ob&s;erves &s;ome kind of ceremony on entering the pa&s;tures, at the conclu&s;ion of which, one of their hor&s;es has all his hair &s;haved off, and is even <HI>&eacute;corch&eacute;;</HI> the hor&s;e which comes in la&s;t, always undergoes this ceremony, which they do with a view to avert what they call the <HI>evil looks,</HI> and every other misfortune that may befall the&s;e animals. This &s;uper&s;tition, though equally &s;ingular as it is ridiculous, may be traced back to the mo&s;t remote antiquity.</P>
<P>The neatne&s;s of the&s;e grooms round their tents is &s;o great, that little &s;quare buildings on the borders of the
<PB N="238" REF="245">
canal, at different di&s;tances, are appropriated for privies, &s;o con&s;tructed, that the water may carry every thing away with it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bo&s;tangis,</HI> who form the fir&s;t exterior guard of the &s;eraglio, have their chief, who is called <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;haw;</HI> he is in general &s;uperintendant, not only of the imperial gardens that are in the city of Con&s;tanti|nople, but likewi&s;e of all the other buildings, fountains, gardens, and delicious places de&s;tined for the Grand Signor's amu&s;ement. The juri&s;diction of the Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;haw extends to the mouth of the Black &s;ea; and having under his in&s;pection all the villages on the coa&s;t of Con&s;tantinople and the Bo&s;phorus, he draws very great revenues from his office. When the &s;ultan goes upon the water, it is the Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;haw who has the conducting of the barge; he is &s;eated behind the &s;ultan, and guides the helm according to his orders; having an opportunity by this means to conver&s;e freely with the Grand Signor, he is particularly e&s;teemed and re|&s;pected. The Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> cau&s;ed the heads of three Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;haws to be cut off, becau&s;e the barge had been agitated too much by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;haw lives without the walls of the &s;eraglio; his habitation, however, communicates with the &s;eraglio it&s;elf. It is in the palace of this mini&s;ter that the torture is applied to malefactors, or &s;uch as are &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o. Among all the people who com|po&s;e
<PB N="239" REF="246">
the &s;eraglio, the Bo&s;tangis are the proude&s;t, rude&s;t, and mo&s;t cruel.</P>
<P>To the Bo&s;tangis &s;ucceed the <HI>Baltajir,</HI> or cleavers and carriers of wood to the different apartments of the &s;eraglio. This cla&s;s forms the &s;econd guard; they wear the &s;ame uniform with the others, except, that the Baltagis have a little blue collar, di&s;tingui&s;hing them from the Bo&s;tangis, by its very long point which de&s;cends to their brea&s;ts: and they both wear a large &s;carlet cap above half a yard high. The&s;e wood clea|vers are very expert in the exerci&s;e of running, leaping, and boxing; and above all, are very &s;kilful in throwing the lance, and in all other bodily exerci&s;es that have a tendency to make them robu&s;t and active.</P>
<P>The cooks and confectioners are likewi&s;e taken from this corps. The former wear a very fanta&s;tical cap made of &s;hining hair, forming a point turned backwards. The latter wear a cap of camels hair, in the &s;hape of a &s;ugar loaf, and of a dark yellow colour. The butchers were likewi&s;e formerly taken from this corps, and wear the &s;ame kind of cap with the con|fectioners. There are al&s;o a great number of dome&s;tics in livery, who wear a &s;hort dre&s;s made of gold &s;tuff, with a cap of gilt metal, ornamented with a large plume of feathers, which originally belonged to this corps; as were the menial &s;ervants of the officers be|longing to the &s;eraglio. But Chri&s;tian &s;laves being
<PB N="240" REF="247">
now grown very &s;carce, the Turks are obliged to be &s;erved in all the above-mentioned offices, by poor people, who obtain their places for a livelihood.</P>
<P>Of all the oriental nations, none give way to their &s;en&s;ual inclinations &s;o much as tho&s;e who profe&s;s the Mahometan religion. This accounts for the &s;ultans having their women guarded always by eunuchs; for love and jealou&s;y are their &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. All the Turks of rank and fa&s;hion adopt a &s;imilar cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>In the &s;eraglio, the white eunuchs form a kind of body-guard to the &s;ultan: and the black ones to the women of the Haram. The chief of the white eunuchs has command over all the pages and white eunuchs of the court: three very con&s;iderable officers, the Grand Chamberlain, the principal <HI>Major Domo,</HI> and the go|vernor of the pages are dependent upon him. There are al&s;o inferior officers belonging to the white eunuchs. From the white eunuchs are &s;elected &s;ome of the curates of the royal mo&s;ques, who are very glad of the&s;e ap|pointments, which generally yield very fine incomes; one mo&s;que in particular produces an hundred ducats a-day.</P>
<P>The black eunuchs are employed chiefly to guard the women; formerly they were imperfectly ca&s;trated much in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>ca&s;trati</HI> of Italy. But Sultan Mu&s;tapha, predece&s;&s;or to the reigning emperor,
<PB N="241" REF="248">
having entertained &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, ordered that from that time all the black eunuchs &s;hould be entirely cut, which method is &s;till followed. Their chief is called the <HI>Ki&s;lar-Aga,</HI> that is, the Aga of the women of the &s;eraglio, as he has the general &s;uperintendance of the Haram, which is that part of the &s;eraglio where the women are kept. Be&s;ides the income he draws from the royal mo&s;ques, he has a thou&s;and ways of ama&s;&s;ing immence riches. The blacke&s;t of the eunuchs are brought from Africa.</P>
<P>All the pages of the &s;eraglio are the &s;ons of Chri&s;|tians made &s;laves in time of war. The incur&s;ions of Turki&s;h robbers in the neighbourhood of Circa&s;&s;ia and other Chri&s;tian countries, afford means of &s;upplying the &s;eraglio, even in time of peace with &s;uch children. The city of <HI>Ake&s;ka</HI> was the rendezvous of the&s;e robbers; its &s;ituation in the vicinity of Georgia was very con|venient for them; as they could a&s;&s;emble two or three thou&s;and hor&s;emen, and make unexpected irruptions into Georgia, and carry off the inhabitants, and every thing they could lay their hands on: they afterwards brought tho&s;e &s;laves that were fitte&s;t for the &s;eraglio to Con&s;tantinople, and the re&s;t were &s;old at Zo&s;erum, from whence they were di&s;per&s;ed all over the Turki&s;h empire. But &s;ince Prince <HI>Heraclius</HI> has refu&s;ed the accu&s;tomed inhuman tribute already mentioned, and put a &s;top to the irruptions of the Turki&s;h banditti and the Tartars, the Georgian &s;laves are &s;eldom to be met
<PB N="242" REF="249">
with, and it is with the utmo&s;t difficulty that the u&s;ual number of pages can be kept up.</P>
<P>When one of the&s;e Chri&s;tian children is fir&s;t ad|mitted into the &s;ervice of the &s;eraglio, he is put under the direction of the chief of the white eunuchs, who places him either in the great or little &s;chool. In the great chamber or &s;chool, there are u&s;ually 600 chil|dren, and in the le&s;&s;er 300. The&s;e children are brought up under a very rigid di&s;cipline, and taught fir&s;t of all, mode&s;ty and politene&s;s. They are then in&s;tructed in the Mahometan religion, and in the Arabian and Per&s;ian languages, in order to enable them to &s;peak the Turki&s;h with greater propriety, and as it is &s;poken in the &s;eraglio. Their cloathing is very neat, and their diet good and whole&s;ome. They lye in large chambers, and have &s;eparate beds placed in rows; between every third or fourth bed, there lyes a white eunuch; the&s;e eunuchs watch them very clo&s;ely to keep them from unnatural vices, which the people in the &s;eraglio are very much given to. When the&s;e youths are old enough to bear the fatigues of &s;trong bodily exerci&s;e, no pains are &s;pared to render them robu&s;t, active, and valiant. They are likewi&s;e in&s;truct|ed in the mechanic as well as liberal arts.</P>
<P>From the&s;e chambers they take the brave&s;t and mo&s;t capable, to employ them about the per&s;on of the Grand Signor: they afterwards di&s;tribute the re&s;t,
<PB N="243" REF="250">
according to their capacity, either in the &s;ervice of the trea&s;ury of the &s;eraglio, or in the repo&s;itory for drugs and cordials, which are carefully prepared for the u&s;e of the Grand Signor and his women. From the &s;ervice of the trea&s;ury and this repo&s;itory, are taken tho&s;e who are e&s;teemed mo&s;t worthy to be promoted to more important charges in the &s;eraglio. By virtue of their employments, they are admitted to the pre|&s;ence chamber, and to the private apartments of the &s;eraglio, &s;o that they can &s;ee and &s;peak to the Grand Signor almo&s;t at any time.</P>
<P>In the room of him who quits the &s;eraglio entirely, another is appointed from the body of the pages. Such is the order of rotation to the offices of the &s;e|raglio, and the gradations of &s;ervices through which they pa&s;s before they quit it, that it &s;eldom happens any officer leaves the palace before he is turned of forty; a time of life when he may be &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t capable of conducting the weighty affairs of &s;tate, with which he may be entru&s;ted. Mo&s;t commonly on leaving the &s;eraglio, they are rai&s;ed to the dignity of ba&s;haws, or agas of the Jani&s;&s;aries, or generals of the cavalry, and &s;ometimes in&s;tantly appointed grand vizirs. It is plea&s;ing to &s;ee them take leave of their friends and acquaintances in the &s;eraglio, adds <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> as the ceremonies they u&s;e on &s;uch occa&s;ions demon|&s;trate a very refined ta&s;te, and nothing further would
<PB N="244" REF="251">
be wanting to convince a bye-&s;tander that the Turks were a mo&s;t polite people.</P>
<P>Contrary to the ideas of all other civilized nations, the Turks &s;et little value on the &s;ciences; they al|ways prefer men of valour to men ver&s;ed in the &s;ciences, for any high office: yet, notwith&s;tanding their &s;light opinion of the &s;ciences, they cultivate &s;ome of them in the &s;chools. They teach the youth of the &s;eraglio to read and write; they then make them learn Arabic, as their books of religion and the laws of their empire are written in that language. It is not till they have perfectly learnt the Arabic, that they are taught the Per&s;ian language, which being melodious and &s;prightly, corrects the har&s;hne&s;s of the Turki&s;h. They then teach them arithmetic, and by &s;uffering their reading Per&s;ian novels and romances, replete with gallantry and lively animated expre&s;&s;ions, the youth acquires a gay and &s;prightly turn of mind. Be|&s;ides the&s;e &s;tudies, &s;ome of them apply them&s;elves to learning the Alcoran by heart, others tran&s;late valu|able books from the Arabic and Per&s;ian into the Turki&s;h language, and each youth makes his remarks and annotations on them for the in&s;truction of the ignorant: many apply them&s;elves to the Per&s;ian and Arabic poetry, and &s;ucceed admirably well. The &s;tudy of mu&s;ic, likewi&s;e, occupies a good part of the time allotted for the in&s;truction of the&s;e young men: mo&s;t certainly the Turki&s;h mu&s;ic is barbarous with
<PB N="245" REF="252">
re&s;pect to the terrible noi&s;e it makes; but it is al&s;o certain that it has its &s;oftne&s;s, and harmony which may very well be reli&s;hed. Except the above-men|tioned &s;ciences, and a &s;light knowledge of medicine and a&s;tronomy, the Turks are, in general, extremely ignorant.</P>
<P>That nothing may be wanting to the &s;plendour and o&s;tentation of the Ottoman court, there are a number of mutes and dwarfs kept. Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, who, in other courts, &s;erve only to amu&s;e the prince, at the Turki&s;h court are employed, not only for the amu&s;ement of the &s;ultan, but to in&s;truct the pages in an art which is not practi&s;ed in other countries. This art con&s;i&s;ts in making them&s;elves under&s;tood by &s;igns, out of re&s;pect to the Grand Signor, that he may not be di&s;turbed by the &s;ound of their voices. There are in the &s;eraglio 140 of the&s;e mutes, who being born deaf, cannot expre&s;s them&s;elves but by &s;igns. At night they lye in the great chamber of the pages, and are in the &s;chools in the day, where they teach the young Chri&s;tian &s;laves to comprehend very long di&s;cour&s;es on different &s;ubjects in this manner. Two or three of the olde&s;t of the&s;e mutes are admitted to the cham|ber of the &s;ultan for his amu&s;ement. The dwarfs are employed in the &s;ame manner. If a dwarf happens to be a mute, he is very much prized; and if an eunuch, likewi&s;e, he is con&s;idered as a prodigy, and no pains
<PB N="246" REF="253">
or expence &s;pared to procure &s;uch a rarity. We will now &s;peak of the women.</P>
<P>All the women in the &s;eraglio are for the &s;ervice of the Grand Signor. No per&s;ons whatever are per|mitted to introduce them&s;elves into the fir&s;t gate that encompa&s;&s;es the haram, that is, the apartments in which the women are &s;hut up. It is &s;ituated in a very remote part of the inclo&s;ure of the &s;eraglio, and looks upon the &s;ea of Marmora. No per&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee the&s;e women, except the &s;ultan and the eunuchs. If any of them goes out of the &s;eraglio, on an excur|&s;ion into the country, with the Grand Signor, the journey is made either in a barge or in a clo&s;e car|riage; and there is a kind of covered way made with linen curtains from the door of their apartment to the place of embarking, or getting into the carriage. All the&s;e women have the &s;ame origin as the pages, and the &s;ame means which are employed to procure the boy &s;laves, are u&s;ed to &s;upply the haram with women. The hand&s;ome&s;t only, or tho&s;e who give hopes of being &s;uch, are received into the &s;eraglio, who mu&s;t all be virgins. They, like the pages, are divided into two chambers, and their manual employment con&s;i&s;ts in learning to &s;ew and embroider. With re&s;pect to their mental and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, they are taught only mu&s;ic, dancing, voluptuous attitudes, and &s;uch other allurements, as decency forbids expatiating upon, by which, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> they endeavour to excite
<PB N="247" REF="254">
the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;ultan. The number of women kept in the &s;eraglio, depends on the plea&s;ure of the Grand Signor. Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> had near 2,000, Sultan <HI>Mahmud</HI> had but 300; and the pre&s;ent emperor has nearly 1,600.</P>
<P>The&s;e two chambers have windows, but they look only on the gardens of the &s;eraglio. Among &s;uch a great number of women, there is not a &s;ingle &s;ervant; and the method in which they wait on one another is not a little peculiar: the la&s;t entered waits upon the one who entered before her, and likewi&s;e upon her|&s;elf, &s;o that &s;he who is at the head of the li&s;t, is &s;erved, without having any one to wait upon, and &s;he who entered la&s;t, has no one to wait upon her. They all &s;leep in &s;eparate beds, and between every fifth, there is a preceptre&s;s &s;tationed to &s;uperintend their conduct. Their head governe&s;s is called <HI>Katon Kiaia,</HI> or the governe&s;s of the noble young ladies. If there is a &s;ultana mother, &s;he forms her court from their cham|ber, having liberty to take as many young ladies as &s;he thinks proper.</P>
<P>The Grand Signor very frequently permits them to walk in the gardens of the &s;eraglio. On &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions all the workmen are ordered to retire, and black eunuchs are placed in every corner, with drawn &s;abres, and others ordered to walk round the gardens, to prevent any per&s;on from looking at them. Should
<PB N="248" REF="255">
any one be found in the gardens at this time, either through ignorance or inadvertence, he is in&s;tantly put to death, and his head brought to the feet of the Grand Signor, who rewards the eunuchs very liberally for their vigilance. Sometimes the Grand Signor him&s;elf goes into the gardens when the ladies are there, and it is then, that by dancing, &s;inging, enticing atti|tudes, and other alluring ge&s;tures, they practi&s;e all their little arts to endeavour to en&s;nare his affec|tions.</P>
<P>It is generally imagined the Grand Signor may take to his bed all the ladies of the &s;eraglio whenever he is &s;o inclined; this is a vulgar error; it was &s;o in former times, but the immen&s;e pre&s;ents which it is u&s;ual to give to tho&s;e ladies who are &s;o favoured by the Grand Signors, determined them to make regula|tions, that have been adopted by all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in which the number, time, and etiquette of cohabi|ting with them is limited. It is true the &s;ultan can, if he plea&s;es, break through the&s;e rules, but he &s;eldom does, e&s;pecially, as be&s;ides the immen&s;e expence in pre&s;ents, it may likewi&s;e co&s;t the lives of tho&s;e girls whom the prince is &s;o partial to. In the reign of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> above 150 women were poi&s;oned, who, by their allurements, had enticed the Grand Signor to be connected with them, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed etiquette. The &s;ultan is not permitted to take a vir|gin to his embraces, except upon &s;ome extraordinary
<PB N="249" REF="256">
fe&s;tival, or great rejoicings. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, if he wi&s;hes a fre&s;h companion for his bed, he goes into the ladies apartment, who are ranged in files by their governe&s;&s;es, and intimates the one he wi&s;hes to have: the ceremony of the handkerchief, which the &s;ultan is &s;aid to throw to the favoured fair, is an idle tale, without any foundation. When the Grand Signor has fixed on the lady he has de&s;tined to be the new partner of his affections, all the others follow her to the bath, wa&s;hing and perfuming her, and after having dre&s;&s;ed her very &s;uperbly, conduct her &s;inging, dan|cing, and rejoicing to the Grand Signor's bed-cham|ber, who, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, is generally already in bed to receive her. As &s;oon as the new-elected fa|vourite enters the chamber, introduced by the prin|cipal eunuch upon guard, &s;he kneels down, and when the &s;ultan calls her, gets into bed at the foot, except the &s;ultan &s;hould order her, as a &s;pecial favour, to approach at the &s;ide. After a certain time, on a &s;ignal given by the &s;ultan, the governe&s;s of the ladies enters the apartment with her &s;uite, and conducts her back to the women's apartment: if, by good fortune, &s;he becomes pregnant and is delivered of a boy, &s;he has the appellation of <HI>A&s;aki Sultane&s;s,</HI> or &s;ultana-mother. On the birth of the fir&s;t &s;on, &s;he has the honour of being crowned, and the liberty of forming her court. Eunuchs are al&s;o a&s;&s;igned her for her guard. No other ladies, though delivered of boys, except the fir&s;t, are either crowned or entertained with any extraor|dinary
<PB N="250" REF="257">
magnificence; they have, however, &s;eparate e&s;tabli&s;hments, with very hand&s;ome appointments.</P>
<P><HI>Thevenot</HI> &s;ays, that in the Grand Signor's bed cham|ber, there are large wax tapers burning all night, and Moori&s;h women &s;itting by them. And that on the&s;e nights he &s;leeps in a chamber belonging to the haram, or women's apartments. And, in the morning, on his ri&s;ing, changes all his dre&s;s and leaves them to her he &s;lept with, be&s;ides whatever money was in his pockets; and that on his returning to his own apart|ments, he &s;ends immediately a pre&s;ent of jewels, money, and magnificent dre&s;&s;es of greater or le&s;s value, according as he was captivated with her charms.</P>
<P>After the death of the &s;ultan, the mother of the male children are &s;hut up in the old &s;eraglio, from whence they can never come out, unle&s;s one of their &s;ons a&s;cend the throne. The old &s;eraglio was the palace of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great: it is &s;ituated nearly in the centre of Con&s;tantinople; there the&s;e &s;ultanas are confined, as al&s;o tho&s;e ladies of the new &s;eraglio who are indi&s;po&s;ed. Tho&s;e who are brought to bed of girls, are allowed the privilege of marrying, when the &s;ultan dies, of which they generally avail them|&s;elves, to &s;ome of the principal per&s;ons of the empire, who are very glad to have them for their riches, and the connexions and patronage which they generally have in the &s;eraglio.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="258">Lady <HI>M.</HI> mentions a favourite &s;ultana, who on being pre&s;ented with an ab&s;olute order to leave the &s;eraglio, and chu&s;e her&s;elf a hu&s;band among the great men of the Porte, at the decea&s;e of the &s;ultan, threw her&s;elf at the feet of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and begged him to poignard her, rather than u&s;e his brother's widow with that contempt. She repre&s;ented to him, in agonies of &s;orrow, that &s;he was privileged from this misfortune, by having brought five princes into the Ottoman family; but all the boys being dead, and only one girl &s;urviving, this excu&s;e was not received, and &s;he was compelled to make her choice. She cho&s;e Bekir-Effendi, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, a Turki&s;h nobleman above four&s;core years old, to convince the world, that &s;he firmly intended to keep the vow &s;he had made of never &s;uffering a &s;econd hu&s;band to ap|proach her bed; and him &s;he cho&s;e as a mark of her gratitude, &s;ince it was he that had pre&s;ented her, at the age of ten years, to her late lord. But &s;he never permitted him to pay her one vi&s;it, though &s;he had been fifteen years in his hou&s;e when lady <HI>M.</HI> vi&s;ited her, and &s;he was then but thirty-&s;ix, but pa&s;&s;ed her time in uninterrupted mourning, with a con&s;tancy very little known in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e ladies who have been connected with the decea&s;ed &s;ultan, but borne no children, are &s;hut up for life in the old &s;eraglio; tho&s;e with whom he has
<PB N="252" REF="259">
had no intercour&s;e, remain in their apartments for the new Grand Signor.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> in his remarks on the Ottoman empire, &s;ays, that the daughters and &s;i&s;ters of the Grand Signor, when married to the vizirs and great men of the em|pire, dwell in their &s;eparate palaces; but that all the male children, who are born to them, are in&s;tantly &s;mothered by the per&s;on who delivers the mother. This, &s;ays he, is the mo&s;t public of all their laws, and that which is lea&s;t infringed. No attempt is made to conceal the&s;e horrible a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; a de&s;picable fear is the cau&s;e of them, more than the intere&s;t of the throne.</P>
<P>The daughters, who alone e&s;cape this murderous law, only pre&s;erve the title of &s;ultana, by adding to it that of <HI>hanum,</HI> common to all women of tolerable fortune; and their children of both &s;exes, whom the&s;e prince&s;&s;es may pre&s;erve, now enter into the general cla&s;s of the people, and are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any title. Born of a grand-daughter of the emperor, the influence of paternal notice, no longer reaches them: the great grandfather has lo&s;t &s;ight of them in the ob|&s;curity of their birth.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, before we fini&s;h this account of the &s;eraglio, that unnatural vices reign in it to exce&s;s, not only among the pages, but al&s;o
<PB N="253" REF="260">
among the ladies. The violent exce&s;&s;es of the pages, and their &s;hameful amours with tho&s;e who are placed about the per&s;ons of the monarch, might lead to very dangerous con&s;equences, if fire and &s;word were not employed to re&s;tore tranquillity. But notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t vigilance of the eunuchs and their gover|nors, the&s;e vices are not to be entirely eradicated. Indeed, how can it be expected, when it is well known, &s;ays <HI>Habe&s;ci,</HI> that almo&s;t all the &s;ultans have them&s;elves been guilty of &s;uch crimes. Sultan <HI>Amurath</HI> was &s;o enamoured of a young Armenian, that he made him his &s;word-bearer. <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. paid &s;uch public homage to a young Greek, that all the court noticed it; he was declared chief favourite, with great cere|mony, and became de&s;pot of the empire. We could produce examples more modern and very recent, but tho&s;e already mentioned &s;ufficiently prove the contagion is ancient, and deeply rooted, and that it can never be extirpated. It is too general among the Mahometans.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t indecent practices are al&s;o very common in the apartments of the ladies. Nor is it to be won|dered at, in girls well fed, leading an idle undi&s;turbed life, and who&s;e chief employ is to prepare them&s;elves for &s;en&s;ual delights. Notwith&s;tanding the fatal doom that awaits them on di&s;covery, the violence of their pa&s;&s;ion hurries them precipitately to their ruin. Alas! how many of the&s;e unhappy girls are thrown,

tied together, in guilty couples, from the &s;eraglio into the &s;ea! In the reign of <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> III. &s;ome hun|dreds thus fell victims to their incontinence; and not a year pa&s;&s;es even at pre&s;ent, though their governe&s;&s;es are ever on the watch, without &s;ome &s;uch &s;acrifice, &s;o &s;hocking to humanity!</P>

<P>HAVING now given as full and de&s;criptive an account of the &s;eraglio and its interior regula|tions, as is to be met with; it remains, only to &s;peak of the pomp and &s;plendour with which the &s;ultan gives audiences to the amba&s;&s;adors of foriegn powers, and of the grandeur and magnificence which attend him on other public occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Turks take care that no amba&s;&s;ador &s;hall be admitted to their audiences, but at certain times, when the Grand Signor is prepared to di&s;play all the pomp and &s;plendour of the court. For this rea&s;on, they are commonly appointed on the days of paying the mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment. The formalities of &s;uch audiences merit a detail, and we &s;hall fix on one given to a Venetian amba&s;&s;ador, as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of the mini&s;|ters of other nations.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="262">The reader &s;hould be apprized that the Ottoman court retains all the ancient oriental magnificence, in its numerous train, &s;umptuous apparel, co&s;tly jewels, and luxury, &s;o often de&s;cribed by other writers; and that it is fond of di&s;playing every external appearance of grandeur that can impre&s;s the minds of its &s;ubjects or &s;trangers with awe, &s;urprize, and terror. A hint nece&s;&s;ary to be given to reconcile to the reader that great and unbecoming haughtine&s;s &s;o vi&s;ible in &s;ome part of their conduct on the&s;e public occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>On the day appointed for the royal audience, the amba&s;&s;ador with his dragoman and &s;ecretary, embarks on board a very &s;uperb galley, from the ar&s;enal at Galata, belonging to the Grand Signor; its chief orna|ments, and the entire out&s;ide of which, are of pure ma&s;&s;ive gold. Upon their landing, the amba&s;&s;ador and all his train, (for he is preceded not only by all his hou&s;hold, but by all the Venetian &s;ubjects either at Pera or Con&s;tantinople,) are received by the <HI>Chiaus Bachi,</HI> or commanding officers of the police, who conduct them to a building on the &s;hore near at hand, to which the Grand Signor occa&s;ionally re&s;orts to enjoy the cool &s;ea breezes; here refre&s;hments are provided, and &s;ome time is &s;pent, while the order of the entry is adju&s;ted. The proce&s;&s;ion then moves on &s;lowly, in the following manner:</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="263">Fir&s;t, three hundred Jani&s;&s;aries on foot, dre&s;&s;ed in their habits of ceremony, the chief article of which con&s;i&s;ts of long bonnets of white cloth, which de&s;cend a con&s;iderable length over their &s;houlders; their head cook clo&s;es the rear, habited in a black pellice, covered with &s;ilver chains, to which are &s;u&s;pended in miniature, and likewi&s;e in &s;ilver, all the uten&s;ils of a kitchen. He is followed by &s;ixty chiaus on hor&s;eback, headed by their officer. After them thirty-&s;ix &s;laves belonging to the amba&s;&s;ador, dre&s;&s;ed in his liveries, with their chief. Next to them, the amba&s;&s;ador's ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, his hor&s;e led by &s;ix grooms in rich liveries. Then the major-domo, and another officer on hor&s;eback, at the head of fifty-&s;ix hor&s;emen be|longing to the amba&s;&s;ador, covered with liveries &s;till more &s;uperb than the former. Next, his excellency's chief page on hor&s;eback, followed by ten other lads who are lingui&s;ts, and &s;ix dragomen or interpreters on hor&s;eback. A colonel of the Jani&s;&s;aries &s;urrounded by &s;ix chiocadars leads up the &s;econd divi&s;ion of this pro|ce&s;&s;ion. La&s;t of all, follows the amba&s;&s;ador in a robe of purple velvet, embroidered with gold flowers, wearing a ducal cap, and mounted on a &s;tately hor&s;e, richly capari&s;oned, and &s;ent to him by the Grand Sig|nor: on each &s;ide of the amba&s;&s;ador's hor&s;e, &s;ix &s;laves in rich liveries. Three noble Venetians, two &s;ecre|taries of emba&s;&s;y, and two others follow his excellency, and after them, all the Venetians on hor&s;eback. This proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es on in this order to the &s;eraglio, and
<PB N="257" REF="264">
la&s;ts two hours from the time of the amba&s;&s;ador's landing.</P>
<P>Having entered the Sublime Porte, in the fir&s;t &s;quare an immen&s;e number of guards are drawn up, through the middle of which, as they fall back, his excellency pa&s;&s;es on hor&s;eback to the gate of the &s;econd &s;quare, where he alights; no per&s;on, except the &s;overeign, being permitted to pa&s;s that gate on hor&s;eback. There he is met by the dragoman of the Porte, and after a few minutes pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd &s;quare, his excellency a&s;cends the flight of &s;teps lead|ing to the divan chamber, preceded by the <HI>Chiaus Bachi,</HI> and the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, very richly dre&s;&s;ed, and both carrying &s;ilver maces, which they &s;trike again&s;t the ground like walking &s;ticks. The grand vizir being already &s;eated on his &s;opha to re|ceive petitions and memorials.</P>
<P>The divan chamber re&s;embles We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, but is neither &s;o long nor &s;o lofty: the breadth ap|pears nearly the &s;ame. It is badly lighted by a large dome in the centre, and at the upper end are the tribunals of the grand vizir, exactly in the &s;ame po&s;i|tion, and rai&s;ed in the &s;ame manner above the hall, as the pa&s;&s;age between the courts of chancery and king's bench, leading to our hou&s;e of commons. Behind the vizir's &s;opha, and no great height above his head, is a &s;mall window, grated with iron bars double gilt, within
<PB N="258" REF="265">
which the Grand Signor is &s;eated; he cannot be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, but it is known when he is there, by the bril|liancy of the large diamonds in his turban. In one angle, at a di&s;tance from the vizir, but at the &s;ame end of the hall, are &s;eated on &s;ophas, the two chief-ju&s;tices of the Ottoman empire; their heads covered with large turbans, the one white, the other green. From an opening in the wall at the left angle, there is an en|trance into a &s;econd hall, which &s;eems united with the fir&s;t; and in this there are a great number of other high officers of &s;tate &s;eated on &s;ophas according to their rank.</P>
<P>But the poor amba&s;&s;ador has a great deal to &s;uffer in the divan chamber before he proceeds any further. The audience of an amba&s;&s;ador is the time of all others cho&s;en to pre&s;ent, publicly, a great number of peti|tions and memorials to the vizir, purpo&s;ely to &s;hew his authority. While this bu&s;ine&s;s goes forward, the vizir &s;ends the dragoman to his excellency, with com|plimentary me&s;&s;ages to fill up the time. The next trial of his patience is, i&s;&s;uing the money for payment of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment for &s;ix months. And as a proof of their o&s;tentation, it will often happen that the day of giving audience to an amba&s;&s;ador cannot be put off till it is due; in which ca&s;e, to the great joy of the military, it mu&s;t be paid in advance, for they will not omit this di&s;play of their riches. It may indeed, happen the &s;ix months are expired, and then the payment is put off to the day of audience.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="266">The money is all brought into the divan chamber in bags called pur&s;es, and flung upon the ground without any order. The grand vizir orders one of them to be opened and counted <HI>pro forma.</HI> The fir&s;t troops to be paid are the Jani&s;&s;aries, of whom not le&s;s than 20,000 are a&s;&s;embled in the outward courts, before the Sublime Porte, upon occa&s;ion of the audi|ence of an amba&s;&s;ador, as impatient to receive their pay as to have the order given to receive what they call the <HI>Mini&s;ters;</HI> being a kind of rice &s;oup, given to them on &s;uch days, by the Grand Signor. The colo|nel of the olde&s;t regiment of the Jani&s;&s;aries appears fir&s;t, at the door of the divan chamber, when he is called in, and as many bags as will pay him and his men, are flung out of the door down the &s;teps, upon which he retires bowing all the way, and con&s;tantly facing the tribunal, &s;o that he walks out backwards. The colonel of every regiment does the &s;ame; but before the &s;econd enters, the money belonging to the fir&s;t mu&s;t be cleared away, which is done by throwing the bags through an aperture like a window into the &s;quare below; where the Jani&s;&s;aries of his regiment count the money again, and then carry it off to their quarters as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; he who can carry away mo&s;t being mo&s;t e&s;teemed by his officers. This ab&s;urd ceremony la&s;ts three hours, and it requires the patience of a Stoic to &s;it it out.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">When this bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed, three tables are co|vered for dinner, one before the vizir, another before the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> and a third before the <HI>Ni&s;&s;angi.</HI> The amba&s;&s;ador alone dines at the vizir's table, and his &s;uite at the other two. This repa&s;t is very &s;hort, though the number and variety of the di&s;hes are inconceivable. The&s;e are all &s;erved up in green china, and one at a time according to the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, but then they are re|moved every two of three minutes; the &s;ervants, how|ever, who attend, u&s;e equal di&s;patch in laying the be&s;t parts on the plates of their gue&s;ts, who, if they like what is &s;erved on their plates, may let the next di&s;h pa&s;s without exchanging it. After dinner the amba&s;&s;ador re|turns to his &s;eat, and the <HI>Reis-Effendi</HI> pre&s;ents to the vizir his memorial requiring an audience of the Grand Signor. The vizir reads and &s;igns it, then wraps it up in a piece of embroidered &s;ilk, and &s;eals it; over this cover he puts a &s;heet of white paper and a private mark; and then delivers it to the <HI>Chiaus Bachi,</HI> who carries it to the Grand Signor. Upon the return of that officer with the &s;ultan's an&s;wer, the vizir quits his &s;opha, and goes to the door of the divan chamber to receive it. He touches it with his forehead, as an act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; then returns to his place, opens and reads it, after which he gives orders that the amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould be conducted through the &s;econd hall, where the other great officers are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged, as before mentioned, and where the <HI>Chiaus Bachi</HI> attend with the pre&s;ents brought by the amba&s;&s;ador for the Grand Signor;
<PB N="261" REF="268">
from thence he proceeds to an open &s;aloon, the door of which opens into the Grand Signor's apartments. Here his excellency and his attendants put on their caftans. As &s;oon as the proper officers have opened this door, the amba&s;&s;ador is introduced by the grand vizir and the aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries, &s;upported on each &s;ide by two <HI>capici-bachis.</HI> In this manner his excel|lency and his train enter the pre&s;ence-chamber, where the Grand Signor is &s;eated on his throne, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;opha rai&s;ed &s;everal feet from the ground, and placed in the upper corner of the room, on the right hand; with upright cu&s;hions to &s;upport his back and arms, if he chu&s;es it; the&s;e cu&s;hions are richly em|broidered, and adorned with pearls and other jewels; the canopy over the throne is extremely magnificent; made of crim&s;on &s;atin, lined with white &s;atin, and faced with plated gold, inter&s;per&s;ed with brilliant diamonds and pearls. But nothing can exceed the &s;plendour of the &s;ultan's dre&s;s, his turban and caftan being al|mo&s;t covered with jewels: the amba&s;&s;ador then bows to the Grand Signor, and addre&s;&s;es him in a &s;hort harangue, in the Venetian language, the purport of which is to a&s;&s;ure his &s;ublime highne&s;s, that the re|public of Venice ardently de&s;ires to cultivate an eternal friend&s;hip with his highne&s;s and all his &s;ubjects. His credentials are then delivered to the grand vizir, who places them on the throne. Upon this the &s;ultan &s;peaks a few words to the vizir, charging him to de|liver an an&s;wer on his part to the amba&s;&s;ador, that he
<PB N="262" REF="269">
will grant peace, friend&s;hip, and protection to him and his countrymen throughout the empire. The amba&s;&s;ador then makes his bow and retires.</P>
<P>As the amba&s;&s;ador and his train reach the &s;econd court, where their hor&s;es are left, before the vizir can get ready with his immen&s;e &s;uite, his excellency is obliged to wait &s;ome time before this parade is adju&s;|ted; for, upon this occa&s;ion, the vizir and all the other great officers of the &s;eraglio go before the am|ba&s;&s;ador to conduct him out of the Porte on his return; after which they &s;eparate, the amba&s;&s;ador and his train proceeding towards Pera, and the vizir at|tended by the other officers going to his own hou&s;e. The proce&s;&s;ion, therefore, from the &s;econd &s;quare of the &s;eraglio to the &s;treet, though &s;hort, is very magnifi|cent.&mdash;Such was the etiquette attending the reception of an amba&s;&s;ador from the republic of Venice.</P>
<P>A remarkable political axiom in the Turki&s;h laws re&s;pecting their impri&s;oning the foreign mini&s;ters, has been totally overlooked by all writers upon their &s;y&s;tem of government, which we think it right to notice: perhaps they were ignorant of the fact. The Ottoman court con&s;iders every amba&s;&s;ador as having two di&s;tinct characters, the one repre&s;entative, the other per&s;onal. In the exerci&s;e of the fir&s;t, they view him as repre&s;enting his &s;overeign, and in this light treat him with great re&s;pect, and even allow that he
<PB N="263" REF="270">
may a&s;&s;ume the tone of a ma&s;ter, and &s;tate his demands to the Grand Signor, complaining of any infringe|ment of treaties, or acts of inju&s;tice committed by the Turks again&s;t the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate he repre&s;ents, and even to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;atisfaction in the mo&s;t peremp|tory terms.</P>
<P>But if he offers to threaten them with an approach|ing war, or proceeds nearly to a declaration of it, before he leaves their dominions, they &s;ay he has a per&s;onal character, which is that of ho&s;tage given by way of a&s;&s;urance and &s;ecurity to the court to which he is &s;ent, and where he re&s;ides, that he will not violate the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them; and in this capa|city they make him re&s;pon&s;ible for the rupture with which he threatens them; and ju&s;tify their di&s;regard to the univer&s;al law of nations, which declares the per&s;ons of amba&s;&s;adors to be &s;acred, even in time of war.</P>
<P>Though there is no di&s;tinction of title between the foreign mini&s;ters re&s;iding at Con&s;tantinople, yet greater honours are &s;hewn to &s;ome than to others. As &s;oon as the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador arrives on the Turki&s;h frontiers, he and all his &s;uite are maintained at the expence of the Grand Signor till his return, be his &s;tay ever &s;o long. The &s;ame conduct was ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to Prince <HI>Repnin,</HI> amba&s;&s;ador-extraordi|nary from Ru&s;&s;ia; but this was upon a very particular
<PB N="264" REF="271">
occa&s;ion, namely, to negociate a peace, and is no pre|cedent for other mini&s;ters from the &s;ame court. The Imperial amba&s;&s;ador, likewi&s;e, brings very rich pre|&s;ents to the Grand Signor, who &s;ends back to the em|peror pre&s;ents &s;till more valuable by his amba&s;&s;ador at Vienna; whereas the amba&s;&s;adors of France, Eng|land, and Holland, make very con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to the &s;ultan, who makes no acknowledgments what|ever in return. The&s;e pre&s;ents the Grand Signor lays a kind of claim to from tho&s;e powers for the per|mi&s;&s;ion granted them to &s;end mini&s;ters to re&s;ide at his court, and for the protection and privileges allowed to their trading &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>There is a peculiar di&s;tinction &s;hewn the Venetian amba&s;&s;ador, be&s;ides that of a public entry, namely, to fire a number of mortars on St. Mark's day, ac|cording to the age of the doge, and to keep the fe&s;tival with as much noi&s;e and mirth as his people &s;hall think proper. This is never permitted to the amba&s;&s;ador of any crowned head, even on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the birth-days, marriages, or coronations of their re&s;pec|tive princes.</P>
<P>The homage they pay the emperor of Germany is very great; and in ca&s;es where they have had rea&s;on to complain of the conduct of the Imperial mini&s;ter at Con&s;tantinople, they have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their complaints,
<PB N="265" REF="272">
and quietly &s;ubmitted to the violation of their mo&s;t &s;acred rights.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of this kind occurred during the late war between the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Turks, of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, that it merits an ample recital of all its cir|cum&s;tances. The ceremony of expo&s;ing the &s;acred &s;tandard of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> by carrying it in grand proce&s;|&s;ion through the principal &s;treets of Con&s;tantinople, previou&s;ly to its being tran&s;ported to the camp, is a &s;olemnity held in the highe&s;t veneration by the Turks, and &s;o &s;acred, that they will not permit any per&s;on of what ever rank or religion, be&s;ides Mu&s;&s;ulmen to &s;ee it; on which account, three days before the day of the proce&s;&s;ion, heralds are &s;ent into every &s;treet of Con|&s;tantinople, to proclaim, that on &s;uch a day the &s;tand|ard of <HI>Mahomet</HI> will be carried through the city, on its way to the army, and that no per&s;on who are not Mahometans are to be in the &s;treets, through which it pa&s;&s;es, or even looking into them, from any of the hou&s;es, on pain of death. Notwith&s;tanding this public prohibition, the Imperial mini&s;ter, unmindful of his public character, which &s;hould have made him more delicate than a private individual on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, was per&s;uaded to gratify the curio&s;ity of his wife and two daughters, who were determined to &s;ee this grand proce&s;&s;ion. For this purpo&s;e he hired a chamber in the hou&s;e of a <HI>moulah</HI> or lawyer, the price of which was fixed at fifty pia&s;tres; two days before the &s;olem|nity
<PB N="266" REF="273">
was to take place, the mini&s;ter found out a more convenient apartment, at an inferior price, which he immediately took, and relinqui&s;hed the fir&s;t. The moulah in vain repre&s;ented that Europeans generally kept their word, but more e&s;pecially mini&s;ters in pub|lic characters; he was refu&s;ed every kind of &s;atisfaction, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with taunts, the mini&s;ter well knowing that no tribunal would dare to proceed again&s;t him; and that though the order of <HI>moulahs</HI> have the mo&s;t powerful intere&s;t with the government, yet their dread of offending his royal ma&s;ter was &s;uperior to every other con&s;ideration. The moulah &s;ubmitted in ap|pearance, without murmuring, but &s;ecretly vowed vengeance, and only waited a proper opportunity to gratify this darling pa&s;&s;ion in the brea&s;t of a Turk.</P>
<P>In the very moment that the holy &s;tandard was pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treet in which the amba&s;&s;ador, his lady, and two daughters had taken a chamber, and as it approached the hou&s;e, from a window of which, half opened, they were looking at the &s;plendid &s;hew, the moulah &s;et up a loud cry, that the holy &s;tandard was profaned by the eyes of infidels, who were view|ing it through the latticed window of &s;uch a hou&s;e. The multitude, which was immen&s;e, as all ranks of people attend &s;uch a &s;olemnity, in&s;tantly took the alarm, and a party, con&s;i&s;ting of near three hundred enraged Jani&s;&s;aries, detached them&s;elves from the proce&s;&s;ion, and broke open the door of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="267" REF="274">
determined to &s;acrifice to the prophet, tho&s;e daring infidels, who had profaned his holy &s;tandard. The imprudent mini&s;ter in vain repre&s;ented to them, that he was the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador; he was in&s;tantly knocked down, and the inner doors being forced, they found the amba&s;&s;adre&s;s, whom they &s;tripped of her jewels and cloaths, and nothing but her age protected her from further in&s;ults. As for the young ladies, they had fallen &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor in a &s;woon, from which they were only recovered by the extreme torture of having their ear-rings torn from them with &s;uch violence, that part of their ears went with them; they were likewi&s;e &s;tripped to their &s;hifts, and what they &s;uffered be&s;ides, no mortal can tell: it was reported that &s;ome of the Jani&s;&s;aries had compa&s;&s;ion on their youth and beauty, and the wretched &s;ituation to which they were reduced, while another party were deaf to all entreaties: be this as it may, after they had plundered them, they retired, and in the evening this deplorable family were &s;ecretly conveyed to Galata.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the grand vizir received information of the horrid outrage committed on the per&s;on of the amba&s;&s;ador and the ladies, he communicated it to the Grand Signor, who conde&s;cended to &s;end him compli|ments of condolence and excu&s;e in his own name, ac|companied with a rich pelice, which is a di&s;tingui&s;hing token of peace in Turkey; and as his &s;ublime highne&s;s knew the mini&s;ter loved money, a very hand&s;ome &s;um
<PB N="268" REF="275">
was &s;ent to him privately, and &s;eparate pur&s;es to the ladies, be&s;ides jewels far &s;uperior to tho&s;e the Ja|ni&s;&s;aries had taken from them. Having received &s;uch ample indemnifications, the whole family &s;eemed per|fectly &s;atisfied; and the young ladies related the ad|venture to their Chri&s;tian friends, in a manner that did no great credit to their mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Had the piece fini&s;hed with this act, all would have been well; but, unfortunately, the Divan thought &s;omething was due to public decorum, and that an ex|ample of &s;everity was requi&s;ite in point of policy, that other foreign mini&s;ters might be a&s;&s;ured of the &s;afety of their per&s;on and property. The &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch was, therefore, made to di&s;cover the individuals guilty of the&s;e per&s;onal in&s;ults and indignities to the amba&s;&s;ador and the ladies, without effect: but the heads of 300 per&s;ons, Jani&s;&s;aries, and others concerned in the riot, were cut off, and information &s;ent to the amba&s;&s;ador of this bloody execution, with a reque&s;t to know, if that would &s;atisfy him? To which he replied, &s;o far as re|&s;pected his own per&s;on and family, he was &s;atisfied; but that having &s;ent di&s;patches to Vienna on the &s;ubject, he could &s;ay no more till they arrived. The courier, impatiently expected by both &s;ides, at length arrived, and brought &s;uch an an&s;wer as might be expected from &s;o di&s;cerning a prince as the emperor. It contained no complaints again&s;t the Porte, but an order of recall to the mini&s;ter, couched in &s;uch terms that &s;truck
<PB N="269" REF="276">
him to the heart, for he in&s;tantly fell &s;ick, and either died by his own hands, or a natural death, in a few days. His wife and daughters &s;oon after returned privately to Vienna, where the &s;tory of the young ladies had arrived long before them, and was repre&s;ent|ed in &s;uch a light to the Empre&s;s Dowager, then living, and ab&s;orbed in devout exerci&s;es, that they were ordered to retire to a convent for the remainder of their life.</P>
<P><HI>Baron Tott</HI> relates a &s;ingular trait of the late empe|ror, which accords little with that immen&s;e &s;tate and &s;plendour with which the Turki&s;h emperors receive amba&s;&s;adors from foreign powers. This prince, &s;ays he, violent and ha&s;ty in his temper, but weak, im|patient, and curious to exce&s;s, exhibited to us, on our return from the &s;eraglio, when Mr. <HI>De Vergennes</HI> had his audience as amba&s;&s;ador, a very &s;ingular &s;cene. We &s;aw him di&s;gui&s;ed like a profe&s;&s;or of the law, ac|compained by two of his officers, who appeared as footmen; he had &s;topped in a &s;treet to &s;ee us go by, and as we pa&s;&s;ed on into the Acmeidan or Hippodrome, we pre&s;ently perceived he had overtaken us, and was running by our &s;ide, but &s;lackening his pace when he came up to the amba&s;&s;ador, he accompanied him to the end of that &s;quare, and then beginning to run again, he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet in front of the proce&s;&s;ion, and entering one of the gates of the &s;eraglio, went out of it again near the &s;ea, to meet us when we were to
<PB N="270" REF="277">
take water. There he remained till our departure, and then returned again to his palace; and we &s;aw no more of him.</P>
<P>I remarked, adds the baron, during the whole time this prince kept us company in the Hippodrome, where we were &s;urrounded by numbers, whom curio&s;ity had drawn together, no one gave the lea&s;t &s;ign or intima|tion which could di&s;cover him, though every one knew him and trembled at his pre&s;ence: but depoti&s;m tyrannizes over every thing, and forces its &s;laves to di&s;&s;emble even the very fear it in&s;pires.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the canal, nearly adjoining to Scutari, is a very magnificent kio&s;h or plea&s;ure-hou&s;e of the Grand Signor's, &s;ituated at Chalcedon, a town of ancient note of which, but little remains are to be &s;een. It had formerly two very celebrated temples, dedicated, one to <HI>Apollo,</HI> the other to <HI>Venus.</HI> When Chalcedon was an eminent city, Scutari was an ignoble village; but by the contrary events of fate, the former is now reduced to nothing, and Scutari is a fair and &s;pacious city. Its canal, among other names, had that of <HI>Fretum Chalcedonium.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this kio&s;h is very plea&s;ant; it is in the centre, and on the highe&s;t &s;pot of a very fine garden. Mo&s;t of the walks are &s;haded with trees, and there are &s;everal noble parterres of very con|&s;iderable
<PB N="271" REF="278">
length. They all end at the kio&s;h, from whence there is a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>It was the natural beauty of this place that inclined <HI>Soliman</HI> II. to build this kio&s;h, where he might retire occa&s;ionally with &s;ome of the ladies of the &s;eraglio. And for this purpo&s;e he had a &s;tately &s;opha built in a place a little higher than the re&s;t, furni&s;hed with quilts, cu&s;hions, and rich carpets, and &s;urrounded with marble balu&s;trades. This &s;opha is a &s;quare and placed in the middle of a large ba&s;on of the &s;ame form, which is in&s;en&s;ibly filled with a great many ca&s;cades, &s;o high as to be fit to bathe in.</P>
<P><HI>Soliman,</HI> who took as much plea&s;ure in the delights of <HI>Venus,</HI> as he did in tho&s;e of <HI>Mars,</HI> had this place enriched with all the voluptuous ornaments, which the &s;kill of Mahometan arti&s;ts could invent, and often cro&s;&s;ed over from his &s;eraglio at Con&s;tantinople, that he might indulge him&s;elf more freely in tho&s;e extra|vagant plea&s;ures to which his inclinations prompted him.</P>
<P>From Lady <HI>C.</HI>'s late account of Con&s;tantinople and its environs, it &s;hould &s;eem the&s;e kio&s;hs are no longer the reigning ta&s;te. The &s;ultans, &s;ays &s;he, formerly built different palaces or plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, on the bor|ders of the canal, which are now for&s;aken. There is one on the A&s;iatic &s;ide, in the mid&s;t of a fine garden,
<PB N="272" REF="279">
falling to ruin very fa&s;t: there are, however, &s;ome very magnificent looking-gla&s;&s;es and furniture &s;till re|maining in it, and what &s;eems very ab&s;urd, the&s;e are not removed, but &s;uffered to fall and peri&s;h as it may plea&s;e the wind and rain. No one being permitted to touch or remove any thing, the Porte and the public are equally lo&s;ers; the garden, large enough to make a beautiful park, is left quite wild, and as no per&s;on goes into it, one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;pots on that coa&s;t, ju&s;t facing the &s;eraglio, is lo&s;t to every one. This is the ca&s;e with every royal re&s;idence, which when aban|doned by the caprice of the &s;overeign, is neither de|moli&s;hed nor even unfurni&s;hed, but &s;uffered to con|tinue in the &s;ame manner as if it was inhabited.</P>
<P>That we may enable our readers to form &s;ome idea of the &s;plendour of the country &s;eats of the great men of the Ottoman empire, we &s;hall give Lady <HI>M.</HI>'s de&s;cription of one on the banks of the canal, belonging to a Grand Vizir, who married a &s;ultana, daughter of the reigning &s;ultan. It is &s;ituated, &s;ays &s;he, on one of the mo&s;t delightful parts of the canal, with a fine wood on the &s;ide of a hill behind it. The extent of it is prodigious; the guardian a&s;&s;ured me there are near eight hundred rooms in it; it is certain the num|ber is very large; and the whole adorned with a pro|fu&s;ion of marble, gilding, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite painting of fruit and flowers. The windows are all &s;a&s;hed with the fine&s;t chry&s;taline gla&s;s brought from
<PB N="273" REF="280">
England, and here is all the magnificence that can be &s;uppo&s;ed in a palace founded by a vain luxurious young man, with the wealth of a va&s;t empire at his command.</P>
<P>But no part of this palace is more to be admired, than the apartments de&s;tined for the bagnios. There are two built exactly in the &s;ame manner, an&s;wering to one another; the bath, fountains, and pavements, are all of white marble, the roofs gilt, and the walls covered with Japan china. Adjoining to them are two rooms, the uppermo&s;t of which is divided into a &s;opha, and in the four corners are falls of water from the very roof, from &s;hell to &s;hell of white marble, to the lower end of the room, where it falls into a large ba&s;on, &s;urrounded with pipes that throw up the water as high as the room. The walls are in the nature of lattices, and on the out&s;ide of them, there are vines and woodbines planted, that form a kind of green tape&s;try, and give an agreeable ob&s;curity to tho&s;e delightful chambers. I &s;hould go on, &s;ays &s;he, and let you into &s;ome of the other apartments, all worthy of being de&s;cribed; but it is harder to de&s;cribe a Turki&s;h palace than any other, being built entirely irregular. There is nothing that can be called front or wings; and though &s;uch a confu&s;ion is plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, yet it would be very unintelligible in de&s;cription. Suffice it, therefore, only to add, that the chamber, de&s;tined for the &s;ultan, when he vi&s;its his daughter, is
<PB N="274" REF="281">
wain&s;coted with mother of pearl, fa&s;tened with emeralds like nails. There are others of mother of pearl and olive wood inlaid, and &s;everal of Japan china. The galleries which are numerous and very large, are adorn|ed with jars of flowers, and porcelane di&s;hes of fruit of all &s;orts, &s;o well done in pla&s;ter, and coloured in &s;o lively a manner, that it has an enchanting effect. The garden is &s;uitable to the hou&s;e, where harbours, foun|tains and walks are thrown together in an agreeable confu&s;ion. There is no ornament wanting, but that of &s;tatues. Thus it may be &s;een, that tho&s;e people are not &s;o unpoli&s;hed as they are repre&s;ented. It is true their magnificence is of a different ta&s;te from that of Europeans, and perhaps of a better. One is apt &s;ometimes to think they have a right notion of life. They con&s;ume it in mu&s;ic, gardens, wine, and delicate eating, while we are tormenting our brains with &s;ome &s;cheme of politics, or &s;tudying &s;ome &s;cience, to which we can never attain, or if we do, cannot per&s;uade other people to &s;et that value upon it we do our&s;elves. It is certain what we feel and &s;ee is properly, if any thing is properly, our own; but the good of fame, the folly of prai&s;e, are hardly purcha&s;ed, and when obtained, poor recompence for lo&s;s of time and health. We die and grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labours; con&s;idering then, what &s;hort-lived weak ani|mals men are, is there any &s;tudy &s;o beneficial, as the &s;tudy of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure?</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">The Grand Signor's dre&s;s differs very little from that of other per&s;ons, except in length and richne&s;s. His turban is like that of the ba&s;haws, except only that he wears plumes and breeches, which they do not. He &s;leeps upon velvet mattre&s;&s;es, or &s;uch as are made of gold cloth, covered in &s;ummer with &s;heets, embroi|red with &s;ilk, and in winter with furs. When he &s;leeps in his own apartments, two old women keep watch in his chamber to light him, if he chu&s;es to count his beads at the hours of prayer, which are twelve at night, and two hours before day-break. The women's dre&s;s is much like that of the men's, for they wear breeches and bu&s;kins, and &s;leep in them, wearing thin ones in &s;ummer, and thick ones in winter.</P>
<P>When he goes to the mo&s;que on Fridays, he is ac|companied through the city by all the ba&s;haws and grandees, be&s;ides a large retinue of &s;ervants who walk by his &s;ide. The people, as he goes along, follow him with repeated acclamations of health and happi|ne&s;s, which he returns by a nod. If he goes abroad by water, he is carried in his barge covered with crim|&s;on velvet, richly embroidered, under which he &s;its, his officers &s;tanding all round him. If by land, he is always on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>It appears even at other times his retinue is very &s;plendid. I went, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> to &s;ee the Grand Signor, in his pa&s;&s;age to the mo&s;que. He was pre|ceded

After them came the aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries, in a robe of purple velvet, lined with &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, his hor&s;e led by two &s;laves richly dre&s;&s;ed. Next him the <HI>Ki&s;lar-Aga,</HI> (this is the chief guardian of the ladies of the &s;eraglio) in a deep yellow cloth, which &s;uited very well to his black face, and lined with &s;ables.

Six more hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned, were led for him; and two of his principal courtiers bore, one his gold, and the other, his &s;ilver coffee-pot on a &s;taff; another car|ried a &s;ilver &s;tool for him to &s;it on.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of Adrianople.</HEAD>
<P>THIS city is 144 miles from Con&s;tantinople, and was anciently called Ore&s;tes, but now receives its name from the Emperor <HI>Adrian;</HI> it was the fir&s;t European &s;eat of the Turki&s;h empire, and has been the favourite re&s;idence of many &s;ultans. Its &s;ituation is very fine, and the country round it very beautiful; but the air is extremely bad, and the &s;eraglio it&s;elf is not free from the ill effects of it. The town, gardens included, is eight miles in compa&s;s. The river Maritza, an|ciently the Hebrus, on which the city is &s;ituated at the place where it receives the Tun&s;a and the Harda, is dried up every &s;ummer, which contributes very much to make it unwhole&s;ome. In winter it is a large and &s;pacious river, but with a &s;low &s;tream. There are two noble bridges over it. The city which is fair and compact, ri&s;es gently from the banks of this river; the exchange is very &s;pacious, being above half a mile in length; the roof arched, and kept extremely neat. It holds three hundred and &s;ixty-five &s;hops, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of rich goods, expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the &s;ame manner as at Exeter-'change, in London, but the pavement is kept much neater, and the &s;hops are all &s;o clean, that they &s;eem ju&s;t painted. Idle people of all &s;orts, walk here for their diver&s;ion, and amu&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="278" REF="285">
with drinking coffee or &s;herbet, which is cried about as oranges and &s;weetmeats are in our play-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Near it is the <HI>Sher&s;ki,</HI> a &s;treet of a mile in length, full of &s;hops of all kinds of fine merchandize, but exce&s;&s;ive dear, nothing being manufactured here. It is cover|ed on the top with boards to keep out the rain, and that merchants may meet conveniently in all weathers. The Be&s;i&s;ten near it, is another exchange, built upon pillars, where all kinds of hor&s;e furniture are &s;old; and glittering every where with gold, rich embroidery, and jewels, it makes a very agreeable &s;hew.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of our accounts of Turkey, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> it is ob&s;erved, that their hou&s;es are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable pieces of building in the world. On the contrary, &s;ays &s;he, the manner of building here appears to me very agreeable and peculiarly adapted to the country. 'Tis true they are not at all &s;olicitous in this city to beautify the out&s;ides of their hou&s;es, and they are generally built with wood, which is the cau&s;e of many inconveniencies, but this is not to be charged to the ill ta&s;te of the people, but to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment. Every hou&s;e, at the death of its ma&s;ter, is at the Grand Signor's di&s;po&s;al, and therefore no man cares to enter into any great expence, which he is not &s;ure his family will be the better for. All their de&s;ign is to build a commodious hou&s;e, that will la&s;t their lives, and they are very indifferent if it falls
<PB N="279" REF="286">
down the year after. Every hou&s;e, great and &s;mall, is divided into two di&s;tinct parts, joining together only by a narrow pa&s;&s;age. The fir&s;t hou&s;e has a large court before it, and open galleries all round it, which to many people will appear very agreeable. The gallery leads to all the chambers, which are commonly large, and with two rows of windows, the fir&s;t being of painted gla&s;s; they &s;eldom build above two &s;tories, each of which has galleries. The &s;tairs are broad, and not often above thirty &s;teps. This is the hou&s;e be|longing to the lord, and the adjoining one is called the haram, that is, the ladies apartment; it has al&s;o a gallery running round it towards the garden, to which all the windows are turned, and the &s;ame number of chambers as the other, but more gay and &s;plendid, both in painting and furniture. The &s;econd row of windows is very low, with grates like tho&s;e of convents, the rooms are all &s;pread with Per&s;ia carpets, and rai&s;ed at one end of them, about two feet. This is the &s;opha which is laid with a richer &s;ort of carpeting, and all round it a &s;ort of couch rai&s;ed half a foot, covered with rich &s;ilk, according to the fancy or magnificence of the owner. Some are of &s;carlet cloth, with a gold fringe; round about this are placed, &s;tanding again&s;t the wall, two rows of cu&s;hions, the fir&s;t very large, and the re&s;t little ones; and here the Turks di&s;play their greate&s;t magnificence. They are generally bro|cade, or embroidery of gold wire upon white &s;atin. Nothing can look more gay and &s;plendid. The&s;e &s;eats
<PB N="280" REF="287">
are al&s;o &s;o convenient and ea&s;y, that a per&s;on accu&s;|tomed to them will never endure chairs again whil&s;t he lives. The rooms are low, which &s;ome people think no fault, and the cieling is always of wood, generally inlaid or painted with flowers. They open in many places with folding doors, and &s;erve for cabinets, more conveniently than ours. Between the windows are little arches to &s;et pots of perfume, or ba&s;kets of flowers. But what is mo&s;t plea&s;ing, is the fa&s;hion of having marble fountains in the lower part of the room, which throw up &s;everal &s;pouts of water, giving at the &s;ame time an agreeable coolne&s;s, and a plea&s;ant da&s;hing found in falling from one ba&s;on to another. Some of the&s;e are very magnificent. Each hou&s;e has a bagnio, which con&s;i&s;ts generally in two or three little rooms leaded at the top, paved with marble, with ba&s;ons, cocks of water, and all conveniences for either hot or cold water.</P>
<P>The harams, or women's apartments, are always built backwards, removed from the &s;ight, and have no other pro&s;pect than the gardens, which are inclo&s;ed with very high walls. There is none of our parterres in them; but they are planted with high trees, which give an agreeable &s;hade, and a very plea&s;ing view. In the mid&s;t of the garden is the kio&s;h, that is, a large room, commonly beautified with a fine fountain in the mid&s;t. It is rai&s;ed nine or ten &s;teps, and inclo&s;ed with gilded lattices, round which vines, je&s;&s;amines,
<PB N="281" REF="288">
and honey&s;uckles make a &s;ort of green wall. Large trees are planted round this place, which is the &s;cene of their greate&s;t plea&s;ures, and where the ladies &s;pend mo&s;t of their hours, employed by their mu&s;ic or em|broidery. In the public gardens there are public kio&s;hs, where people go that are not &s;o well accom|modated at home, and drink their coffee, &s;herbet, &amp;c. Neither are they ignorant of a more durable manner of building; their mo&s;ques are all of free &s;tone, and the public khans or inns, are extremely magnificent; many of them taking up a large &s;quare, built round with &s;hops under &s;tone arches, where poor artificers are lodged gratis. They have always a mo&s;que joining to them, and the body of the khan is a mo&s;t noble hall capable of holding three or four hundred per&s;ons; the court extremely &s;pacious, and &s;urrounded by cloi&s;ters, that give it the air of our colleges; and this, no doubt, is a more rea&s;onable piece of charity, than the founding of convents.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t beauty of this city, and as &s;ome think of the whole empire, is the mo&s;que of Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> the &s;econd, built by him out of materials brought chiefly from the ruins of Famagu&s;ta in the i&s;land of Cyprus. Yet the area not being &s;quare, nor &s;upported with &s;uch rich or corre&s;pondent pillars, four only excepted, that adorn the front, I e&s;teem it, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> inferior to the two noble mo&s;ques of <HI>Solyman</HI> and <HI>Achmet,</HI> at Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="289">It is &s;ituated very advantageou&s;ly in the mid&s;t of the city, and in the highe&s;t part of it, making a very noble &s;hew. The fir&s;t court has four gates, the inner|mo&s;t, three. They are both of them &s;urrounded with cloi&s;ters, with marble pillars of the Ionic order, finely poli&s;hed, and of very lively colours, the whole pave|ment is of white marble, and the roof of the cloi&s;ters, divided into &s;everal cupolas or domes, headed with gilt balls on the top. In the mid&s;t of each court are fine fountains of white marble, and before the great gate of the mo&s;que, a portico with green marble pillars, which has five gates, the body of the mo&s;que being one prodigious dome. It has two rows of marble galleries on pillars, with marble balu&s;trades, the pave|ment is al&s;o covered with Per&s;ian carpets. It is no &s;mall addition to its beauty, that it is not divided into pews, and encumbered with forms and benches like our churches; nor are the pillars, which are mo&s;t of them red and white marble, disfigured by the little tawdry images and pictures, that give Roman Catholic churches the air of toy &s;hops. The walls &s;eem to be inlaid with &s;uch very lively colours, in &s;mall flowers, as to give them at fir&s;t &s;ight the appearance of precious &s;tones. In the mid&s;t, hangs a va&s;t lamp of &s;ilver, gilt; with at lea&s;t two thou&s;and of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize. This mu&s;t look very glorious when they are all lighted; but being at night, no women are &s;uffered to enter.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="290">Under the large lamp is a great pulpit of carved wood, gilt, and ju&s;t by, a fountain to wa&s;h, which is an e&s;&s;ential part of their devotion. In one corner is a little gallery enclo&s;ed with gilded lattices for the Grand Signor. At the upper end of a large niche, very like an altar, rai&s;ed on two &s;teps, and covered with gold brocade, are two &s;ilver gilt candle&s;ticks, the heighth of a man, and in them white wax-candles as thick as a man's wri&s;t.</P>
<P>This mo&s;que is adorned with four regular and beau|tiful minarets, each of which has 244 &s;tairs leading into the uppermo&s;t balcony. Each minaret has three bal|conies, that imitate the capitals of pillars, between which the whole body of the column is regularly channelled. One of them is remarkable for having three &s;tairca&s;es winding one within another, &s;o that three prie&s;ts may a&s;cend to each of the balconies without meeting one another. It is from the&s;e balconies that the Imans call the people to prayers. From the up|permo&s;t of them, &s;ays <HI>Chi&s;hull,</HI> we had an opportunity of viewing the &s;everal parts and precincts of the city, the plat of the &s;eraglio, the cour&s;e of the rivers, and the face of the country below, with the bu&s;y cares of the &s;everal mortals wandering about like &s;o many ants on that &s;pot of earth then &s;ubject to our eye.</P>
<P>Adjoining to one of the&s;e mo&s;ques is a mad-hou&s;e, a noble building of a circular figure, covered with a
<PB N="284" REF="291">
regular cupola, and having a large area in the middle, with a ci&s;tern of water; but conveniently divided all round into chambers made arch-ways, and opening on one &s;ide into the area. Here the madmen are kept, who are all furni&s;hed with clean mats, and tied clo&s;e down to the pavement by an iron chain fa&s;tened about their necks for greater &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>For &s;ome miles round this city, the whole ground is laid out in gardens, and the banks of the rivers are &s;et with rows of fruit trees, under which the better cla&s;s of people divert them&s;elves every evening, not with walking, that not being one of their pa&s;times; but a &s;et party of them chu&s;e a green &s;pot, where the &s;hade is very thick, and they &s;pread a carpet, on which they fit drinking their coffee, and are generally at|tended by &s;ome &s;lave who has a fine voice, or plays on &s;ome in&s;trument. Every twenty paces one of the&s;e little companies may be &s;een, li&s;tening to the da&s;hing of the river; and this ta&s;te is &s;o univer&s;al that the very gardeners are not without it. I have often &s;een them and their children, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> &s;itting on the banks of the river and playing on a rural in&s;trument, per|fectly an&s;wering the de&s;cription of the ancient fi&s;tula, being compo&s;ed of unequal reeds, with a &s;imple but agreeable &s;oftne&s;s in the &s;ound. There is not a &s;ingle in&s;trument of mu&s;ic, &s;he adds, among the Greek or Roman &s;tatues, that is not to be found in the hands of the people of this country. The young lads generally
<PB N="285" REF="292">
divert them&s;elves with making garlands for their favourite lambs, which they paint and adorn with flowers; and who are lying at their feet all the time they are &s;inging or playing. Such are the ancient amu&s;ements here, and which are as natural to them as cudgel-playing and foot-ball to our Briti&s;h &s;wains: the &s;oftne&s;s and warmth of the climate forbidding all rough exerci&s;es, which were never &s;o much as heard of among&s;t them; and naturally in&s;piring a lazine&s;s and aver&s;ion to labour, which the great plenty indulges. The&s;e gardeners are the only happy race of country people in Turkey. They furni&s;h all the city with fruits and herbs, and &s;eem to live very ea&s;ily. They are mo&s;t of them Greeks, and have little hou&s;es in the mid&s;t of their gardens, where their wives and daughters take a liberty not permitted in the city, that of going unveiled. The&s;e wenches are very neat and hand|&s;ome, and pa&s;s their time at their looms under the trees.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who vi&s;it this province of Turkey, <HI>Theo|critus</HI> will no longer be looked upon as romantic: he has only given a plain image of the way of life among the pea&s;ants of his country, who, before oppre&s;&s;ion had reduced them to want, were probably employed as the better &s;ort of them are now. Had he been born a Briton, his Idyllium would have been filled with de&s;criptions of thre&s;hing and churning; both which are unknown here, the corn being all trodden out by oxen, and butter unheard of.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="293">Many of the cu&s;toms, and much of the dre&s;s, re|corded in the writings of <HI>Homer,</HI> will &s;till be found retained by the inhabitants of this country. The prin|ce&s;&s;es and great ladies pa&s;s their time at their looms, embroidering veils and robes, &s;urrounded by their maids, who are always very numerous, in the &s;ame man|ner as we find <HI>Andromache</HI> and <HI>Helen</HI> de&s;cribed. The de&s;cription of the belt of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> exactly re&s;embles tho&s;e that are now worn by the great men in Turkey, fa&s;tened before with broad golden cla&s;ps, and em|broidered round with rich work. The &s;nowy veil that <HI>Helen</HI> threw over her face is &s;till fa&s;hionable. Their manner of dancing is certainly the &s;ame that <HI>Diana</HI> is &s;aid to have danced on the banks of the Eurotas. The great lady &s;till leads the dance, and is followed by a troop of young girls, imitating her &s;teps; and if &s;he &s;ings, make up the chorus.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>M.</HI> tells us, &s;he paid a vi&s;it here to the kahya's lady, an officer equal in rank to the grand vizir. I was met at the door, &s;ays &s;he, by two black eunuchs, who led me through a long gallery, between two ranks of beautiful young girls, with their hair finely plaited, almo&s;t hanging to their feet, and dre&s;&s;ed in fine light dama&s;ks, brocaded with &s;ilver. I was &s;orry that de|cency did not permit me to con&s;ider them nearer. But that thought was lo&s;t upon my entrance into a large room or rather pavillion, built round with gilded fa&s;hes, which were mo&s;t of them thrown up, and the

trees planted over them gave an agreeable &s;hade, which hindered the &s;un from being trouble&s;ome. The je&s;&s;amines and honey-&s;uckles that twi&s;ted round their trunks, &s;hed a &s;oft perfume, increa&s;ed by a white marble fountain playing &s;weet water in the lower part of the room, which fell into three or four ba&s;ons with a plea&s;ing &s;ound. The roof was painted with all &s;orts of flowers, falling out of gilded ba&s;kets, that &s;eemed tumbling down. On a &s;ofa, rai&s;ed three &s;teps and covered with fine Per&s;ian carpets, &s;at the kahya's lady, leaning on cu&s;hions of white &s;atin embroidered; and at her feet &s;at two young girls about twelve years old, lovely as angels, dre&s;&s;ed perfectly rich, and almo&s;t covered with jewels. But they were hardly &s;een near the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> for this was her name, &s;o much did her beauty efface every thing I have &s;een, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> nay all that has been called lovely either in England or Germany. I mu&s;t own I never &s;aw any thing &s;o gloriou&s;ly beautiful, nor can I recollect a face that would have been taken notice of near her's. She &s;tood up to receive me, &s;aluting me after their fa&s;hion, put|ting her hand to her heart with a &s;weetne&s;s full of maje&s;ty, that no court-breeding could ever give. She ordered cu&s;hions to be given me, and took care to place me in the corner, which is the place of honour. I was &s;o &s;truck with admiration, that I could not for &s;ome time &s;peak to her, being wholly taken up in gazing. That &s;urprizing harmony of features! that charming re&s;ult of the whole! that exact proportion
<PB N="288" REF="296">
of body! that lovely bloom of complexion, un&s;ullied by art! the unutterable enchantment of her &s;mile;&mdash; But her eyes!&mdash;large and black, with all the &s;oft lan|gui&s;hment of the blue! every turn of her face di&s;co|vering &s;ome new grace!</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;urprize being over, I vainly endeavoured by nicely examining her face to find out &s;ome imper|fection, and was clearly convinced of the error of that vulgar notion, that a face exactly proportioned, and perfectly beautiful, would not be agreeable; nature having done for her with more &s;ucce&s;s, what <HI>Apelles</HI> is &s;aid to have e&s;&s;ayed by a collection of the mo&s;t exact features to form a perfect face. Add to all this, a behaviour &s;o full of grace and &s;weetne&s;s, &s;uch ea&s;y motions with an air &s;o maje&s;tic, yet free from &s;tiffne&s;s and affectation, that could &s;he have been &s;uddenly tran&s;ported upon the mo&s;t polite throne of Europe, nobody would think her other than born and bred to be a queen, though educated in a country we call bar|barous. To &s;ay all in a word, our mo&s;t celebrated Engli&s;h beauties would vani&s;h near her.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ed in a caftan of gold brocade, flowered with &s;ilver, very well fitted to her &s;hape, and &s;hew|ing to admiration the beauty of her bo&s;om, only &s;haded by thin gauzes. Her drawers were pale pink, her wai&s;tcoat green and &s;ilver, her &s;lippers white &s;atin, finely embroidered; her lovely arms adorned with
<PB N="289" REF="297">
bracelets of diamonds, and her broad girdle &s;et round with diamonds; upon her head a rich Turki&s;h hand|kerchief of pink and &s;ilver, her own fine black hair hanging a great length, in various tre&s;&s;es, and on one &s;ide of her head &s;ome bodkins of jewels.</P>
<P>Her fair maids were ranged below the &s;opha, to the number of twenty, very much re&s;embling the pictures of the ancient nymphs. I did not think all nature could have furni&s;hed &s;uch a &s;cene of beauty. She made them a &s;ign to play and dance. Four of them immediately began to play &s;ome &s;oft airs on in|&s;truments, between a lute and a guitar, which they accompanied with their voices, while the others danced by turns. Nothing could be more artful or more proper to rai&s;e <HI>certain ideas.</HI> The tunes &s;o &s;oft;&mdash; the motions &s;o langui&s;hing! accompanied with pau&s;es and dying eyes!&mdash;half falling and then recovering them&s;elves in &s;o artful a manner, that the colde&s;t and mo&s;t rigid prude upon earth, could not have looked upon them without thinking of a &s;omething not to be &s;poken of.</P>
<P>When the dance was over, four fair &s;laves came into the room, with &s;ilver cen&s;ors in their hands, and perfumed the air with amber, aloes wood, and other &s;cents. After this they &s;erved me coffee upon their knees, in the fine&s;t japan china, with <HI>&s;oucoups</HI> of &s;ilver gilt. The lovely <HI>Fatima</HI> entertaining me all this while
<PB N="290" REF="298">
in the mo&s;t polite and agreeable manner. When I took my leave, two maids brought in a fine ba&s;ket of embroidered handkerchiefs; &s;he begged I would wear the riche&s;t for her &s;ake, and gave the others to my woman and interprete&s;s. I retired through the &s;ame ceremonies as before, and could not help thinking I had been &s;ome time in Mahomet's paradi&s;e; &s;o much was I charmed with what I had &s;een.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription of Lady <HI>M.</HI>'s reception by the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> may &s;erve to give &s;ome faint idea of the beauty, &s;plendour, and elegance that reign in the harams of the Turki&s;h officers of &s;tate, not only in Adrianople, but throughout the ea&s;t. Beauty in general, adds Lady <HI>M.</HI> is more common here than with us. It is even &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee a young woman that is not very hand&s;ome. They have naturally the mo&s;t beautiful complexions in the world, and generally large black eyes. They generally &s;hape their eye-brows, and both Greeks and Turks have the cu&s;tom of putting round their eye-brows a black tincture, that at a di&s;|tance or by candle-light, adds very much to the black|ne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>The ladies in this city have in reality more liberty than we have. No woman, of what rank &s;oever, is permitted to go into the &s;treet without two murlins, one that covers her face, all but her eyes; and another that hides the whole dre&s;s of her head, and hangs half
<PB N="291" REF="299">
way down her back. Their &s;hapes are al&s;o wholly concealed by a thing they call a <HI>Ferig&eacute;e,</HI> which no woman of any &s;ort appears without; this has &s;trait &s;leeves, that reach to the fingers ends, and it laps all round them not unlike a winding &s;heet, reaching to the feet. In winter it is of cloth, and in &s;ummer of plain &s;tuff or &s;ilk. In this dre&s;s there is no di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the great lady from her &s;lave. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t jealous hu&s;band to know his wife, when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a wo|man in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>This perpetual ma&s;querade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of di&s;|covery. The mo&s;t u&s;ual method of intrigue is, to &s;end an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a Jew's &s;hop, which are as notoriou&s;ly convenient as our hou&s;es in London, where they &s;ell India goods; and yet even tho&s;e who don't make u&s;e of them, do not &s;cruple to go to buy pennyworths, and tumble over rich goods, which are chiefly to be found among that &s;ort of people. The great ladies &s;eldom let their gallants know who they are; and it is &s;o difficult to find it out, that they can very &s;eldom gue&s;s at her name, whom they have corre&s;ponded with for half a-year together. It may ea&s;ily be imagined the number of faithful wives is very &s;mall in a country where they have nothing to fear from a lover's indi&s;cretion; neither have they much to apprehend from the re&s;ent|ment
<PB N="292" REF="300">
of their hu&s;bands: tho&s;e ladies that are rich, having all the money in their own hands.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the rich trade&s;men in this city are Jews. That people have incredible power in this country. They have many privileges above all the natural Turks them&s;elves, and have formed a very con&s;iderable commonwealth here, being judged by their own laws. They have drawn the whole trade of the empire into their hands, partly by the firm union among them&s;elves, and partly by the idle temper and want of indu&s;try in the Turks. Every ba&s;&s;a has his Jew, who is his <HI>"homme d'affaires;"</HI> he is let into all his &s;ecrets, and does all his bu&s;ine&s;s. No bargain is made, no bribe received, no merchandize di&s;po&s;ed of, but what pa&s;&s;es through their hands. They are many of them im|men&s;ely rich, but they take care to make little public &s;hew of it; though they live in their hou&s;es in the utmo&s;t luxury and magnificence.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es are not put here to any laborious work, nor are they at all fit for it. They are beautiful and full of &s;pirit, but generally little, and not &s;o &s;trong as the breed of colder countries; very gentle, however, with all their vivacity, and al&s;o &s;wift and &s;ure-footed. The bea&s;ts de&s;tined to the plough are buffaloes. The&s;e are larger and more clum&s;y than an ox; they have &s;hort thick black horns clo&s;e to their heads, which grow turning backwards. It is &s;aid this horn looks
<PB N="293" REF="301">
very beautiful when it is well poli&s;hed. They are all black, with very &s;hort hair on their hides, and have extremely little white eyes, that make them look like devils. The country people dye their tails, and the hair of their forehead red, by way of ornament.</P>
<P>They carry all their burdens on camels. The&s;e animals are much higher and far &s;wifter than the fleete&s;t hor&s;e, but very ill &s;haped, and di&s;proportioned. They are never thoroughly tamed; the drivers take care to tie them one to another with &s;trong ropes, fifty in a &s;tring led by an a&s;s, on which the driver rides. There are &s;ometimes three hundred of them in one caravan. They carry the third part more than a hor&s;e; but 'tis a particular art to load them, becau&s;e of the hunch on their backs.</P>
<P>The &s;eraglio is built in a flat verdant plain, at the foot of the city, between the Hebrus and the Tun&s;a; but more immediately on the banks of the latter. It is &s;urrounded almo&s;t on all &s;ides with a thick grove of beech and elm, which forms the re&s;emblance of a park from within the walls of the &s;eraglio, and from the city affords a very beautiful pro&s;pect, the whole coun|try round being very bare of wood. A &s;quare wall enclo&s;es the fabric, which is truly mean, and of a con|fu&s;ed intricate figure; but, as it is commonly &s;aid, well contrived for convenience. The walls are plain free &s;tone, and the covering lead. Nothing can be more
<PB N="294" REF="302">
grateful to the eye, than the &s;ight of this level verdant &s;ituation; and yet on account of its lowne&s;s and too near approach to the rivers, no &s;ituation can be more unwhole&s;ome. It &s;eems to &s;tand on the very &s;pot where <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> gave that famous defeat to <HI>Licinius.</HI></P>
<P>Philippopolis is a pretty large town near this city, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground in the way to Con&s;tanti|nople from the lower part of Germany. The country from hence to Adrianople is the fine&s;t in the world. Vines grow wild on all the hills, and the perpetual &s;pring they enjoy makes every thing gay and flouri&s;h|ing. This town was fir&s;t founded by <HI>Philip</HI> father of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, from whom it received al&s;o its name. In 1360 the Turks made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it. The neighbouring country abounds remark|ably in rice. The flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the &s;ciences and <HI>beaux arts,</HI> among the Greeks, has been chiefly owing to the Thracians; but at pre&s;ent there is &s;carce a per&s;on of any eminence in literature through all Romania.</P>
<P>In this town there is a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians that call them&s;elves Paulines. They &s;hew an old church, where they &s;ay St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and he is their favourite &s;aint, after the &s;ame manner that St. <HI>Peter</HI> is at Rome; neither do they forget to give him the preference over the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the People, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in this great empire is very di&s;proportionate to the extent and good|ne&s;s of the country; and may be attributed to three cau&s;es: pe&s;tilence, polygamy, and war. This accounts for &s;uch large tracks of fine &s;oil lying wa&s;te; though the avarice of the governors is likewi&s;e in part culpable for this de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, owing to the tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ion of the ba&s;haws of the provinces, the people removed their per&s;ons and effects to the capital in &s;uch numbers that it was impo&s;&s;ible to find room for them and the old inhabitants: the divan, therefore, publi&s;hed an order, that all tho&s;e families who had not been e&s;tab|li&s;hed twenty years in the city &s;hould leave it, and guards were placed at the gates, to prevent the arrival of any more &s;ubjects from the provinces.</P>
<P>The inhabitants con&s;i&s;t of various nations, of Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Servians, Bo&s;nians, Bulgarians, Walachians, and Tartars, with no &s;mall number of Jews, e&s;pecially at Con&s;tantinople and in Sclavonia.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="304">The Turks are &s;tigmatized among the Chri&s;tians as a &s;lothful, &s;tupid, and inhuman people; but they by no means are &s;o wicked and dreadful, as the French and other writers have thought proper to repre&s;ent them. Turkey is not without men of talents, probity, and honour; and there are many very benevolent, liberal, ingenious, and enlightened characters to be found in every part of the empire. No people are more punctual in their dealings than the Turks. In compa&s;&s;ion and love towards our neighbour, they excel all the re&s;t of mankind. One &s;triking mark of their charity, is their building khans or public inns, called by the A&s;iatics <HI>caravan&s;eras,</HI> for the accommodation of travellers, which are to be met with in almo&s;t every little village. In the&s;e every traveller of whatever religion or country he be, may continue three days <HI>gratis;</HI> and in many of them he is, likewi&s;e, found in victuals. The Turks are very fond of erecting the&s;e buildings, con&s;idering it to be a work of charity, and which will be acceptable to God.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame laudable view they &s;earch out the be&s;t &s;prings, and dig wells, which, in tho&s;e countries, are a luxury to the wearied traveller. In their de|meanour the Turks are rather hypocondriac; they are grave, &s;edate, and pa&s;&s;ive; but when their minds are agitated by pa&s;&s;ion, they are furious, raging, and ungovernable: in matters of religion, tenacious, &s;uper|&s;titious, and moro&s;e. The morals of the A&s;iatic
<PB N="297" REF="305">
Turks are &s;aid to be far preferable to tho&s;e of the European. They are more ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, and if there be any vices among them, tho&s;e of avarice and inhumanity reign chiefly among their great men.</P>
<P>Not only the caravan&s;eras, and wells, or ci&s;terns, but likewi&s;e the roads and bridges in Turkey are kept in repair by the labour and indu&s;try of private indi|viduals, who con&s;ider it a work of charity which will be highly accepted by Heaven, to provide for the entertainment and comfort of the weary traveller; even tho&s;e who live by their daily labour, and have nothing el&s;e to contribute, will &s;pend part of their time gratuitou&s;ly in this employment; and it is &s;aid in the ea&s;tern part of the empire, that the ho&s;pitable natives, like <HI>Abraham</HI> of old, will invite &s;trangers as they pa&s;s through their towns to their tents and hou&s;es, and contend for the honour of entertaining them.</P>
<P>Piety, &s;ays <HI>Pey&s;onnell,</HI> and not &s;uper&s;tition, as <HI>Tott</HI> affirms, has multiplied the <HI>Namas-Giahs,</HI> and the foun|tains have been con&s;tructed by humanity and charity. Tho&s;e who founded the latter, very ju&s;tly e&s;teemed it a highly meritorious action to relieve the thir&s;ty pa&s;|&s;enger in the &s;treets, or the parched traveller on the roads, and to &s;upply them witth the means of making tho&s;e ablutions which mu&s;t infallibly precede their prayers. Many have even carried their benevolence
<PB N="298" REF="306">
&s;o far as to a&s;&s;ign &s;ums of money for furni&s;hing &s;now during the &s;ummer, that tho&s;e who drink at the&s;e fountains, may render the water more cool and re|fre&s;hing.</P>
<P>To the &s;laves and &s;ervants who are about them they behave very commendably, and frequently much bet|ter than the Chri&s;tians do to theirs. In the fir&s;t years of their &s;ervitude the&s;e people &s;uffer mo&s;t, e&s;pecially if they are young; as the Turks endeavour partly by fair means, and partly by threats, to bring them over to their own religion; but the&s;e trials being over, cap|tivity is nowhere more tolerable than in Turkey; in&s;omuch that if a &s;ervant under&s;tands any art or trade, the only thing he can want is his freedom, being &s;up|plied with every other thing he can wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>As there is a great mixture of inhabitants throughout the empire, &s;o is there more particularly in the capital. If Con&s;tantinople had no other inhabitants than Turks, it would not be half &s;o populous as it is. The Greeks, Armenians, and Jews form a con&s;iderable body of its citizens. The Greeks are the mo&s;t nume|rous; and though they have lo&s;t the confidence of the Turki&s;h government as a nation, they &s;till pre&s;erve as individuals an influence greater than that of any other Chri&s;tian &s;ubjects of the Ottoman empire. The governments of Moldavia and Walachia are always be&s;towed on Greeks, where they exerci&s;e a &s;overeign
<PB N="299" REF="307">
authority almo&s;t independent of the Porte. There are at Con&s;tantinople many de&s;cendants from the an|cient families of Greece; who have pre&s;erved their pedigrees entire, but they bear no other marks of their antiquity than the names of the illu&s;trious per&s;ons from whom they de&s;cend, and a few u&s;ele&s;s privileges which they enjoy in con&s;equence of their noble birth. Almo&s;t all the great and opulent Creeks live at Fanari, a &s;uburb at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Con&s;tantinople, but which joins the chain of buildings continued on from the walls of that city, in the &s;ame manner as Newington and Vauxhall are adjoining to London.</P>
<P>The dragomen of the Porte, and of all the towns on the frontiers, are Greeks. The Turks place a great confidence in the&s;e men, knowing their family con|nexions, and that all their hope of life are centered in Turkey.</P>
<P>Great numbers of Greeks, likewi&s;e, embrace the eccle&s;ia&s;tical life, and by means of patronage at the Porte, obtain benefices in the Greek church and the dignities of bi&s;hops and patriarchs. Other Greeks &s;hut them&s;elves up in the numerous mona&s;teries throughout Turkey. Such are the re&s;ources of the better &s;ort. As to the common people, they are engaged in com|merce and the mechanic arts; the &s;ea &s;ervice al&s;o employs great numbers, and many of them work in the ar&s;enal. In general they are very poor; and as
<PB N="300" REF="308">
they de&s;pi&s;e the Armenians and all other Chri&s;tians, not of their own church and nation, they have a great number of enemies.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve in this place, that there are about forty ancient Greek families re&s;iding in Con&s;tantinople, called <HI>Mot&s;ellemin,</HI> that is, Remit|ters. They are the de&s;cendants of the malcontents, who, at the fall of the Greek empire, betrayed their country and their &s;overeign, by joining with the Turks, who laid &s;iege to the city, and putting it into their hands, from which circum&s;tance they have derived their name. They enjoy to this pre&s;ent time, the privilege of wearing yellow &s;lippers and red drawers like the Turks, and are exempt from the annual tribute paid by other Chri&s;tians &s;ubjects of the Ottoman em|pire. Trifling immunities, &s;ays <HI>Hahe&s;ci,</HI> for &s;o great a crime! They are, however, univer&s;ally dete&s;ted, and are obliged to live &s;ecluded from &s;ociety; for if they attempt to mix in company, they are immediately reproached with the treachery of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The Greeks, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> who are the ancient inha|bitants of the country, live intermixed with the Turks, and in &s;everal places, particularly in the i&s;lands, out|number them. In Con&s;tantinople alone, it is com|puted there are no le&s;s then four hundred thou&s;and. They are accu&s;tomed to &s;ervitude, and prefer living under the Turki&s;h exactions, to the &s;piritual tyranny of
<PB N="301" REF="309">
the Pope; but they mu&s;t be very cautious of not giving even the lea&s;t colour for &s;u&s;picion of their holding corre&s;pondence with the enemies of the Porte, or of meditating a &s;edition. It is u&s;ual, for greater &s;ecu|rity in ca&s;e of war with the Chri&s;tian powers, to di&s;arm them. All Greeks from the age of fourteen, pay annually, at the beginning of the Turki&s;h fea&s;t of Bayram, a capitation tax, which amounts to about a ducat, and receive a note of it. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed higher; a deacon paying two ducats and an Archimandrite four; but the bi&s;hops, archbi&s;hops, and patriarchs pay large &s;ums, generally as much as the arbitrary avarice of the grand vizir and ba&s;haws &s;hall think proper to require. The taxes on merchants are e&s;timated according to the value of the commodi|ties they import. The Turks every where lay hold of all opportunities to extort money from the Greeks, but e&s;pecially from the clergy. In return for this tribute they enjoy the protection of the Ottoman Porte, and are maintained in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their properties, in&s;omuch that no Turk is to in&s;ult them, take any thing from them, or intrude them&s;elves into their hou&s;es again&s;t their will; and in ca&s;e of any &s;uch injuries, they are certain of expeditious ju&s;tice again&s;t the delinquents. The Greek women are exempt from all taxes, as are likewi&s;e great numbers of other Greeks who &s;erve in the navy, or el&s;ewhere. It &s;ometimes happens, indeed, that a Greek girl of di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty, is taken away, and carried to the &s;eraglio;
<PB N="302" REF="310">
but it is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;tian women in general, are forced away from their parents to be brought up in Mahometani&s;m: when any thing of this kind is done, it mu&s;t be in provinces remote from Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>The Armenians, another people &s;ubject to the Turks, contribute greatly to the population of the capital. Their number in the city and its environs is computed at 60,000. The major part are merchants, and in general they are very rich. Mo&s;t of the bankers are Armenians. They are &s;ectaries following the doctrine of <HI>Eutyches,</HI> who denied the exi&s;tence of two natures in Chri&s;t, the divine and human; maintaining that the fir&s;t only exi&s;ted under the appearance of the latter. They have their patriarch at Con&s;tantinople, a nume|rous prie&s;thood and &s;everal churches: a great part of them profe&s;s the Roman Catholic religion; the&s;e have no churches, but re&s;ort to the chapels of the foreign amba&s;&s;adors. The Armenians, in general, bear a very good character; they are pious, faithful, hone&s;t, and polite to every one; but the Turks will not employ them in any &s;ervice whatever; yet they avail them&s;elves of their opulence by extorting money from them under various pretences.</P>
<P>The Jews come next under our con&s;ideration. Their number in and about Con&s;tantinople is a&s;toni&s;hing; they reckon 40,000 families, which on a moderate
<PB N="303" REF="311">
Calculation make 200,000 per&s;ons. They are &s;ubject to a kind of ari&s;tocratical government among them|&s;elves; and it &s;eldomor ever happens that they appeal from the &s;entences of their own judges to the Turki&s;h tribunal. They po&s;&s;e&s;s great riches, and live as much at their ea&s;e, as they can do in a Chri&s;tian country; for the Turks e&s;teem them much more than they do Chri&s;|tians. There is not a &s;ingle branch of art or commerce which they do not carry on. Every Turki&s;h family, as well in Con&s;tantinople as Adrianople, who are of any note, have Jews familiar in their family. One may judge from this, of the number and quality of their protectors&mdash;a circum&s;tance which makes them haughty and in&s;olent to the Greeks and other Chri&s;|tians. All the inferior officers in the cu&s;toms, are Jews. The factor to the Aga of the Jani&s;&s;aries is a Jew, and perhaps the mo&s;t con&s;iderable one in the city. They are not permitted to purcha&s;e lands, which is the only privilege refu&s;ed them. Their intercour&s;e with the Turks of rank gives them a knowledge of their private affairs, and of their &s;ecrets, which they turn to no &s;mall account as pimps and &s;pies. A fo|reign amba&s;&s;ador may know more of the &s;tate of the Turki&s;h cabinet, by gratifying the avarice of a Jew, that being his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, than from any other channel whatever.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect; to the external con&s;titution of the Turks, they are generally robu&s;t and well &s;haped, of
<PB N="304" REF="312">
a good mien, and gracious countenance, and patient under hard&s;hips; this renders them fit for war, to which they inure them&s;elves from their youth. Per|&s;ons of rank &s;eldom train up their children to any other profe&s;&s;ion, from an idea, that no glory is com|parable to that acquired in war. It &s;eldom happens that any Turk is lame or crooked; <HI>Le Brun</HI> remarks, that one may meet with more crippled ill-&s;haped people in one town of Europe, than in all the Grand Signor's empire. They almo&s;t all arrive to a great age, for which this very natural rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned, that they never eat any thing but what is good and whole&s;ome, without attending like Chri&s;tians to the delicacy and variety of di&s;hes, which is often very prejudicial to the &s;tomach and the more noble parts. Hence it is, that they are &s;eldom indi&s;po&s;ed, and &s;carce ever troubled with tho&s;e di&s;orders &s;o common among us, &s;uch as the gravel, &s;tone, gout, &amp;c. This is owing in part to their baths as well as to the temperance of their diet. The women are no le&s;s well &s;haped than the men. Lady <HI>M.</HI> has remarked that they have naturally the mo&s;t beautiful complexions in the world.</P>
<P>They generally &s;hape their eye-brows with a black tincture, and dye their nails of a ro&s;e colour. Baron <HI>Tott</HI> &s;ays, that the drug &s;o much u&s;ed in A&s;ia for this purpo&s;e is a black impalpable powder, &s;o volatile as to &s;pread it&s;elf like a fine down, upon a &s;mall bra&s;s

The method of u&s;ing it is to take out the wire, to which the cork &s;erves for a handle, without its touching the edges of the bottle, which would rub off the powder, and apply its extremity to the interior corner of the eye, re&s;ting upon it the two eyelids, and drawing it &s;oftly towards the temples, in order to leave within the eyelids two black &s;treaks, which give to fine eyes a har&s;hne&s;s they do not naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which the Turks take for an air of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>What will appear much more extraordinary, is, that the men them&s;elves, and even old men, are guilty of this coquetry. The u&s;e of the <HI>Surma,</HI> is almo&s;t general. It is true, they pretend it &s;trengthens the &s;ight, but it is more certain that its effect is not very plea&s;ing. Every thing in this country which can contribute to pre&s;erve beauty, or &s;upply the want of it, is eagerly &s;ought after.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of tinging the eyebrows and eyela&s;hes is not &s;o frequent among the common people, and &s;eems to belong more peculiarly to opulence, and a kind of inactivity nece&s;&s;ary for this &s;pecies of beauty; for it is certain that this impalpable powder, placed &s;o carefully on the edge of the eyelids, would &s;pread it&s;elf very di&s;agreeably on any profu&s;e per&s;piration. Yet the lower rank of people, who&s;e labour impo&s;e daily a tax on wealthy idlene&s;s, have al&s;o their peculiar decora|tion:
<PB N="306" REF="314">
it con&s;i&s;ts, as in mo&s;t uncultivated nations, in covering their arms and legs, and &s;ometimes their brea&s;ts, with figures drawn by punctures, and which, before they are indented, are rubbed over with &s;ome colour that &s;inks, and is retained. The blue colour produced by gunpowder is the mo&s;t common, and prejudice furni&s;hes mo&s;t of the &s;ubject matter for this &s;trange ornament. The names of Je&s;us and Mahomet di&s;tingui&s;h the Chri&s;tians and the Turks, who are fellow-labourers; and gallantry comes in forks &s;hare in the embelli&s;hment. Amorous ver&s;es are often to be &s;een mixed with pa&s;&s;ages of the Koran; but the &s;pecies of gallantry intended, is not always &s;o preci&s;ely a&s;cer|tained as that it may not be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians are not more &s;ickle in their manner of decorating their per&s;ons, than the Turks are con|&s;tant to their peculiar mode of dre&s;s. They do not &s;o much as know what it is to make any alteration in their fa&s;hions. That kind of dre&s;s which was worn many centuries ago is &s;till in u&s;e among them.

<PB N="307" REF="315">
though their dre&s;s to a &s;tranger may appear uniform. The Greeks wear a kind of turban of black lamb's &s;kin, narrower on the crown than that of the Arme|nians, with black drawers and black &s;lippers. The Armenians, on the contrary, wear purple drawers and red &s;lippers. The Turks wear yellow &s;lippers; and Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who forbid any Chri&s;tians to wear the &s;ame under pain of death, ordered, likewi&s;e, that they &s;hould wear red &s;lippers; but the haughty Greeks, re&s;olving to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Arme|nians, pre&s;ented a petition to that monarch, that they might be allowed to wear black, which was granted on con&s;ideration of a pretty large &s;um paid into the emperor's private trea&s;ury. The Jews wear drawers and &s;lippers of a &s;ky blue colour; their turban is entirely different from that of the Chri&s;tians, and they have two bunches of hair hanging down by the &s;ides of their ears. The&s;e people are very fond of appearing what they are, le&s;t they &s;hould be mi&s;taken for Chri&s;tians. But there are &s;ome privileged per&s;ons both Greeks and Jews, who are allowed to wear yellow &s;lippers, and &s;carlet drawers, the &s;ame as the Turks; &s;uch as the dragomen or interpreters, and the <HI>Mot&s;ellemins,</HI> tho&s;e Greeks we have already noticed, and who are likewi&s;e exempted from any annual tribute. As the city of Con&s;tantinople is crowded with inhabitants, it is very ea&s;y for the Greeks and others to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves in the Turki&s;h dre&s;s, to avoid paying it; but if the former are di&s;covered, their heads are &s;truck

<P>To &s;hew how rigorous they are in enforcing this law, the reigning Grand Signor was walking one day in di&s;gui&s;e through the &s;uburbs of Fanari, attended only by two favourite dome&s;tics, a black and white eunuch, when he met a young man who wore three peli&s;&s;es one above another, and who had, likewi&s;e, a very rich pipe in his mouth, and to add to this luxury, he had on yellow &s;lippers; the &s;ultan imagined he mu&s;t either be &s;ome dragoman, or the &s;on of &s;ome bey, or at lea&s;t &s;ome privileged Greek; curio&s;ity in|duced him to order an enquiry to be made, and it was found that he was only the &s;on of a Greek butcher at Fanari, upon which be ordered his attendants to put him in&s;tantly to death upon the &s;pot. Such is the &s;trictne&s;s with which laws and ordinances are enforced in that empire. Stern people contend, it is the lea&s;t cruelty never to pardon the infringement of any law which has once been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But to return to their dre&s;s; they wear their drawers next to their &s;kin, and over the drawers is their &s;hirt; next to that, the doliman, a kind of ca&s;&s;ock reaching down to their heels with &s;trait &s;leeves which they but|ton on the wri&s;t. In &s;ummer this doliman is made of
<PB N="309" REF="317">
callico, or &s;triped mu&s;lin; and in winter of &s;atin, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;tuff, which is u&s;ually quilted. They then girt them&s;elves about the wai&s;t with a &s;ilk &s;carf, or leathern belt, which is about three inches broad, and fa&s;tened by a gold or &s;ilver buckle. At their belts they gene|rally hang a couple of daggers, the handles of which are inlaid with gold and &s;ilver, and &s;ometimes with precious &s;tones. <HI>Bi&s;ani</HI> mentions a pacha having one that co&s;t ten thou&s;and guineas. Over the doliman they wear a ferig&eacute;e or night-gown, which, in winter, tho&s;e who are rich enough, have lined with valuable furs. This ferig&eacute;e is very much like our loo&s;e great coats, only longer; it reaching to the heels; it has al&s;o very large and long &s;leeves, and being thrown loo&s;ely over the doliman, &s;erves in&s;tead of a cloak. The lower part of the body is not only covered with the drawers and the &s;hirt, but the men wear over the&s;e, a pair of red cloth breeches, which come down to their heels like trow&s;ers, and at the bottom are fa&s;tened to leathern pumps, of a yellow colour, which they call <HI>Me&s;tes.</HI> The <HI>Papouches</HI> are of the &s;ame colour, and made very much like our &s;lippers.

or &s;ilk &s;tuff many ells long, and by the fa&s;hion of it, the rank and quality of any per&s;on is known. No one, but a Turk, is allowed to wear a white turban. This part of their dre&s;s they never take off but when they retire to re&s;t. The privilege of wearing a green tur|ban is only granted to tho&s;e per&s;ons who can prove them&s;elves de&s;cended from their prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The&s;e are called <HI>Scheriffs</HI> or <HI>Emirs,</HI> which &s;ignify nobles, and there are great numbers of them: becau&s;e, if the daughter of an Emir is married to a Turk who is not &s;o, and has a &s;on, he is an Emir by his mother's &s;ide, and enjoys the &s;ame privileges as if he was de|&s;cended from the male line. The women who are of this de&s;cent are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a piece of green &s;tuff, fa&s;tened to their <HI>Talpock</HI> or head dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The attire of the ladies of Con&s;tantinople, has a &s;ingular air of grandeur and magnificence in it, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the dre&s;&s;es of the women of other countries, and much more becoming.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the dre&s;s is a pair of drawers, very full, that reach to the &s;hoes, and conceal the legs more mode&s;tly than petticoats. Mine, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> in a de&s;cription of part of her own Turki&s;h dre&s;s, were of a thin ro&s;e-coloured dama&s;k, brocaded with &s;ilver flowers. Over this hangs a &s;hift of a fine white &s;ilk gauze, edged with embroidery. This &s;hift has wide &s;leeves hanging half way down the arm, and is clo&s;ed
<PB N="311" REF="319">
at the neck with a diamond button; but the &s;hape and colour of the bo&s;om is very well to be di&s;tingui&s;hed through it. The antery is a wai&s;tcoat made clo&s;e to the &s;hape, of white and gold dama&s;k, with very long &s;leeve sfalling back, and fringed with deep gold fringe; this generally has a diamond or pearl button. The caftan of the &s;ame &s;tuff with the drawers, is a robe exactly fitted to the &s;hape, and reaching to the feet, with very long &s;trait falling &s;leeves. Over this is the girdle of about four fingers broad, which all that can afford it, have entirely of diamonds, or other precious &s;tones; tho&s;e who will not be at the expence, have it of exqui&s;ite embroidery, on &s;atin; but it mu&s;t be fa&s;tened before with a cla&s;p of diamonds. The <HI>curd&eacute;e</HI> is a loo&s;e robe they throw off, or put on, according to the weather, being of a rich brocade, (mine, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> is green and gold) either lined with ermine or &s;ables; the &s;leeves reach very little below the &s;houlders. The head dre&s;s is compo&s;ed of a cap called a talpock, which is in winter of fine velvet, embroidered with pearls or diamonds; and in &s;ummer of a light &s;hining &s;ilver &s;tuff. This is fixed on one &s;ide of the head, hanging a little way down with a gold ta&s;&s;el, and bound on, either with a circle of diamonds, (as I have &s;een &s;everal) or a rich embroidered handkerchief. On the other &s;ide of the head, the hair is laid flat, and here the ladies are at liberty to &s;hew their fancies; &s;ome putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers, and in &s;hort, what they plea&s;e; but the mo&s;t general fa&s;hion is a
<PB N="312" REF="320">
large bouquet of jewels, made like natural flowers, that is the buds of pearls, the ro&s;es of different coloured rubies; the je&s;&s;amines of diamonds, the jonquils of topazes, &amp;c. &s;o well &s;et and enamelled 'tis hard to imagine any thing of that kind &s;o beautiful. The hair hangs at its full length behind, divided into tre&s;&s;es, braided with pearl or ribband, which is always in great quantity. I never &s;aw in my life, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> &s;o many fine heads of hair. In one lady's, I have counted a hundred and ten of the tre&s;&s;es, all natural; but it mu&s;t be owned that every kind of beauty is more com|mon here than with us.</P>
<P>The head dre&s;s of the Turki&s;h ladies, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> is &s;o contrived, that they can put it on and take it off without undoing it, and it will &s;erve them for &s;everal days together; after which they give it a different fa&s;hion, according to the &s;everal ta&s;tes and the fancies of the wearers. This head dre&s;s is &s;o heavy, on ac|count of its largene&s;s, that it is a perfect burthen to them in &s;ummer. There are &s;ome of the Turki&s;h ladies, who only wear a fur cap on their heads, others again wear a large round platine after the fa&s;hion of the Jewi&s;h women, except that it leans on the fore|head, ri&s;es up behind, and has on each &s;ide, a feather fa&s;tened to it, and large plumes of black feathers hang from the ears, which dangle down on their bo&s;oms. Others again encircle their heads with a cap made up of a great many handkerchiefs of different colours,
<PB N="313" REF="321">
worked in gold and &s;ilver, to which they fa&s;ten all &s;orts of trinkets, compo&s;ed, as Lady <HI>M.</HI> has remarked, in the &s;hape of no&s;egays, and which are made of wrought gold, and &s;et round with precious &s;tones, while others wear only natural flowers, &s;uch as pinks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Craven</HI> de&s;cribes the dre&s;s in which the Turki&s;h ladies walk about the &s;treets, as con&s;i&s;ting of a large loo&s;e robe of dark green cloth, covering them from the neck to the ground, over that, a large piece of mu&s;lin, which wraps over the &s;houlders and the arms, and another that goes over the head and eyes; &s;uch coverings, &s;ays &s;he, confound all &s;hape and air &s;o much, as to give them the appearance of walking mummies; and men or women, prince&s;&s;es or &s;laves, may be equally concealed under them.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of one of the &s;ultanas that Lady <HI>M.</HI> went to vi&s;it, apppears to have been &s;o &s;urprizingly rich, that the particulars of it, we believe, will not be un|intere&s;ting. She wore a ve&s;t called <HI>Dualma,</HI> which differs from a ca&s;tan by longer &s;leeves, and folding over at the bottom. It was of purple cloth, fitted to her &s;hape; and thick &s;et, on each &s;ide down to her feet, and, likewi&s;e, round the &s;leeves with pearls of the very be&s;t water, of the &s;ame &s;ize as their buttons com|monly are, that is about the bigne&s;s of a pea, and for the&s;e buttons there are large loops of diamonds, in the form of tho&s;e gold loops &s;o common on birth-day coats.
<PB N="314" REF="322">
This habit was tied at the wai&s;t with two large ta&s;&s;els of &s;maller pearls, and embroidered round the arms with diamonds. Her &s;hift was fa&s;tened at the bottom with a great diamond, &s;haped like a lozenge, her gir|dle as broad as the broade&s;t Engli&s;h ribband, entirely covered with diamonds. Round her neck &s;he wore three chains which reached to her knees; one of large pearl, at the bottom of which hung a fine coloured emerald, as big as a Turkey egg; another con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred emeralds, clo&s;e joined together of the mo&s;t lively green, perfectly matched, every one as large as a half-crown piece, and as thick as three crown pieces; and another of &s;mall emeralds, perfectly round. But her ear-rings eclip&s;ed all the re&s;t. They were two diamonds, &s;haped exactly like pears, as large as a big hazle nut. Round her talpock, &s;he had four &s;trings of pearls very large, the white&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in the world, at lea&s;t enough to make four necklaces, fa&s;tened with two ro&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of a large ruby for the middle &s;tone, and round them twenty drops of clean diamonds to each. Be&s;ides this, her head dre&s;s was covered with bodkins of emeralds and diamonds. She wore large diamond bracelets, and had five rings on her fingers, except Lord <HI>Camelford</HI>'s, the large&s;t I ever &s;aw in my life. 'Tis for jewellers to compute the value of the&s;e things, but according to the common e&s;timation of jewels, her whole dre&s;s mu&s;t have been worth an hundred thou&s;and pounds. This I am &s;ure, that no European queen has half the quantity, and the
<PB N="315" REF="323">
Empre&s;s of Germany's jewels, though very fine, would look extremely mean near her's. This is the &s;ultana who threw her&s;elf at the &s;ultan's feet, on being ordered by him at his coming to the throne, to leave the &s;e|raglio, and chu&s;e her&s;elf a hu&s;band among the great men of the Porte; and reque&s;ted him in agonies of &s;orrow rather to poniard her than treat his brother's widow with that contempt.</P>
<P>Though the Turks are &s;o &s;umptuous in their dre&s;s, yet they are not in general &s;o expen&s;ive in their diet; and if Europeans are &s;o ab&s;urd as to hurt their con|&s;titutions by their luxurious mode of living, it is not &s;o with the Turks, who for the mo&s;t part are &s;atisfied with a &s;lender bill of fare, and carry, as it were, their kitchen along with them. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual food, which they call pilau, is rice, boil'd up with the broth of a fowl, or &s;ome other meat. This is &s;uffered to boil till all the liquor is evaporated, and the rice becomes perfectly dry. If they have no meat (according to <HI>Le Brun</HI>) they boil up their rice with butter and water; &s;ometimes they put curds into it, and add a little &s;affron in order to colour it; at other times they put honey into their rice. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual method is to &s;ea&s;on it with a great deal of pepper, in order to give it a reli&s;h. Tho&s;e who can afford it, put a fowl in it, or a piece of beef or mutton, which by this means eats very tender.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="324">Their table is the ground, or el&s;e a &s;mall table rai&s;ed about a foot from it, round which they all &s;it cro&s;s-legged like &s;o many taylors. Their table-cloth is a large piece of Spani&s;h leather, which they call the <HI>Sofra,</HI> and in&s;tead of a napkin, they make u&s;e of a long piece of blue linen, which goes all round the table. When they are &s;eated, the u&s;ual grace before dinner is, <HI>Bi&s;millah,</HI> that is, in the name of God. When they have dined, their grace is equally &s;hort, and &s;imilar to the &s;norte&s;t of ours: for they only &s;ay <HI>Hamah dilah,</HI> i. e. God be prai&s;ed: and immediately wa&s;h their hands.</P>
<P>If they have any other di&s;h, be&s;ides their boiled rice, which among the common &s;ort of people &s;eldom happens, then this is &s;erved up la&s;t, as is the cu&s;tom at the tables of people of fa&s;hion; and it is eaten with wooden &s;poons. Fowls are &s;erved up whole in the <HI>pilau,</HI> and pulled to pieces by one of the company: as to beef and mutton, whether it is roa&s;ted or boiled, it is always cut into &s;mall pieces before it is &s;erved up. The Turks &s;eldom drink at their meals; but when dinner is over, a large jug of water is placed on the table, of which every one drinks as he likes, and then grace is &s;aid. Among people of quality, in|&s;tead of a table they have a kind of large rai&s;ed di&s;h with a little brim, which they call a <HI>Sime.</HI> This they put on the <HI>So&s;ra,</HI> and upon this <HI>Sime,</HI> tho&s;e di&s;hes that contain the victuals are placed one after another; for

<P>They make their bread fre&s;h every day, and, in order to have it exceedingly light, put into it a great quantity of leaven. It is generally very coar&s;e and not unlike our &s;ea-bi&s;cuits in &s;hape and &s;ize, only a little thicker. The common people make it &s;erve for a plate to put their meat on, and thus eat both at once.</P>
<P>They have a way of roa&s;ting their meat which gives it a very delicate ta&s;te; this is by cutting it into &s;mall pieces and putting them upon a thin &s;pit, with a &s;lice of onion between each piece; for the onions of this country have incomparably a more delicious ta&s;te than tho&s;e that grow in more northern climes. The Greeks frequently eat them as we do chee&s;e or butter at the conclu&s;ion of their meals. In all the parts of Turkey that I travelled through, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> I fur|ni&s;hed my&s;elf with the&s;e onions when I could meet with them, and found that eating them with a little bread and &s;alt made a very dainty repa&s;t. This makes me no longer wonder, he adds, that the Egyptians &s;hould have laid out &s;uch large &s;ums on this vegetable, during the building of their pyramids, as hi&s;torians informed us they did.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="326">Oil is likewi&s;e an ingredient which they very fre|quently u&s;e as a &s;auce to mo&s;t of their meats, without its being in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive. For the oil in this country is very clear, &s;weet, and plea&s;ant to the palate; &s;o that with a little &s;alt it maybe eaten upon bread in|&s;tead of butter. A little juice of lemon or a few drops of vinegar put into &s;ome oil, and mixed up with a little pepper and &s;alt, make an excellent &s;auce for many kinds of fi&s;h; and this in time becomes &s;o palatable, that a per&s;on, who is a little u&s;ed to it, can do very well without butter, were it ever &s;o good. For, in &s;hort, cu&s;tom is &s;econd nature, and in general, what is agree|able, and plea&s;ing, in the u&s;e of different kinds of food, con&s;i&s;ts only in this. Tho&s;e things to which we have been u&s;ed from our childhood, &s;eem natural to us as long as we live; and each country has &s;omething pecu|liar to it&s;elf, which it knows not how to part with, merely from the force of habit. I have often ob&s;erved, adds <HI>Le Brun,</HI> who was a Dutchman, that the Greek women in Con&s;tantinople married to our merchants, would never eat any of the chee&s;e and butter &s;ent them from Holland, though it was generally &s;ome of the be&s;t of the kind, but would prefer eating olives and blanched beans, though they were half rotten, in the &s;ame manner as the Italians eat &s;mall artichokes with pepper and vinegar. The Turks, likewi&s;e, roa&s;t artichokes upon a gridiron with a little oil, pepper, and &s;alt put between the leaves, which give them a very great reli&s;h, and take off that flabby ta&s;te which they have, when boiled, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is our manner of dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="319" REF="327">
them. The Turks have, likewi&s;e, another method of dre&s;&s;ing them, and that is by cutting them into quarters and frying them. The common people live very much upon raw cucumbers and melons, for a great part of the year; which they eat without any kind of previous preparation; and in&s;tead of bread, they eat cakes, made of meal, which they bake upon the hearth, and carry along with them when they travel. Their diet, in &s;hort, like their fa&s;hions, never alters from one century to another; and though no people are more extravagant in their dre&s;s, there are none more temperate in their food than the Turks.</P>
<P>The dinner which is &s;erved up to the Grand Signor, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> is pre&s;ented by the gentleman &s;ewer, in a large di&s;h all at once. He &s;its at table after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, and has a rich embroidered napkin put before him to pre&s;erve his cloaths, and another is tied round his arm with which he wipes his hands. The di&s;hes and plates are all either china or <HI>Terra|&s;igillata,</HI> which is &s;aid to be good again&s;t poi&s;on.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who pretend he is &s;erved in gold plate; but this &s;eems rather improbable, as the Turks look upon it to be a &s;in to eat off gold or &s;ilver, which is the rea&s;on they u&s;e wooden &s;poons.</P>

<P>But it is time we &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of their liquors. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual drink is water, coffee, and &s;herbet. Their coffee, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> is made, and &s;erved up in their coffee-hou&s;es, in a manner rather different from the cu&s;tom of other countries. Water is always kept boiling, and if any per&s;on calls for coffee, &s;ome of it is put into a &s;mall coffee-pot with a certain portion of coffee, and boiled up two or three times, beating it all the while again&s;t the &s;ides of the coffee-pot with a &s;mall &s;tick or two, and in&s;tead of letting it &s;ettle, they pour it out of the coffee-pot backwards and forwards a great many times, and then bring it without milk or &s;ugar in very &s;mall china cups, without handles. In order to form &s;ome judg|ment of the great con&s;umption of this article of luxury in Con&s;tantinople, there is one particular place where there are no le&s;s than 300 per&s;ons continually em|ployed in roa&s;ting and peeling coffee, and it is cal|culated, that in the different coffee-hou&s;es, there are 1,000 <HI>oques</HI> of coffee u&s;ed every day, each <HI>oque</HI> is 42 ounces. This liquor they hold to be good again&s;t the head-ach, and to keep down vapours from ri&s;ing to the brain; it likewi&s;e comforts the &s;tomach, and helps dige&s;tion; they even conceit it to be a general panacea, and good again&s;t all kinds of di&s;orders. Every per|&s;on, whether rich or poor, drinks at lea&s;t two or three

di&s;hes every day. To infu&s;e any thing in it, they imagine makes it le&s;s whole&s;ome, and takes off from its virtues.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h coffee-hou&s;es are generally built like their <HI>kio&s;hs,</HI> admitting the air on all &s;ides, which makes them exceedingly cool. They are the rendezvous of the indolent in every &s;tation of life. The vizir, the captain pacha, and the &s;ultan him&s;elf, frequently go there in di&s;gui&s;e to hear what is &s;aid of them; for the conduct and mo&s;t minute actions of the people in power, are equally the topic of conver&s;ation, and &s;crutinized with as much rigour in Turkey, as in any other countries.</P>
<P>Their other liquor is &s;herbet, which is their u&s;ual drink; this is made either of honey and water, with the juice of lemon, and a little ro&s;e-water to give it an agreeable perfume; or el&s;e of lemon, water, and &s;ugar. This liquor is very plea&s;ant, and a per&s;on may make a kind of pa&s;te or cake from the different ingredients, to take with him on his journey, which requires only a little fre&s;h water poured upon it, to make a very agreeable and refre&s;hing liquor.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important and re&s;pectful of the ceremo|nies in waiting upon a Turki&s;h nobleman, is the pre&s;enting of &s;herbet, which is always followed by an a&s;per&s;ion of ro&s;e-water and perfumes of aloes. This
<PB N="322" REF="331">
&s;herbet, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> &s;o much talked of in Europe, and &s;o little known, is made of con&s;erved fruits di&s;|&s;olved in water, but with &s;o much mu&s;k as almo&s;t to de&s;troy the ta&s;te of the liquor. Thus the va&s;e once filled, &s;uffices for the vi&s;its of the week. I u&s;ed it very &s;paringly, &s;ays he, as I likewi&s;e did the con&s;erves brought with the coffee, and in the &s;erving of which, they never change the &s;poon. The &s;ame ceremony was repeated in the anti-chamber in favour of my lacquey, who was far from practi&s;ing my ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s on this occa&s;ion: his appetite le&s;s delicate, refu&s;ed no|thing; he ate whatever they gave him; ginger, com|fits, and con&s;erves; and &s;wallowed at a &s;ingle draft all the &s;herbet.</P>
<P>This &s;obriety of the Turks does not &s;uit the genius of the northern nations, who love plenty of wine and &s;trong liquors, as well as good eating. A &s;ack of rice every year, with a few jars of butter, and &s;ome dried fruits are &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for a very numerous family. And it is to this temperance, chiefly, that the people of the ea&s;t are indebted for their healthy and robu&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Turks are likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ionately fond of &s;weet-meats, and all kind of perfumes; which they have in much greater perfection, than in the &s;outhern parts of France, and Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="332">We &s;hall conclude this account of their mode of living, as to their diet, with Lady <HI>M.</HI>'s dinner at the widowed &s;ultana's, who&s;e profu&s;ion of jewels we have already noticed. She gave me a dinner, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> of fifty di&s;hes of meat, which, after their fa&s;hion, were &s;erved up one after the other, and was extremely tedious. But the magnificence of her table was cor|re&s;pondent to her dre&s;s. The knives were of gold and the hafts &s;et with diamonds. But the piece of luxury which grieved my eyes, was the table-cloth and napkins; the&s;e were all tiffany embroidered with gold, in the fine&s;t manner, in natural flowers. It was with the utmo&s;t regret I made u&s;e of the&s;e co&s;tly nap|kins, which were as finely wrought as the fine&s;t hand|kerchiefs that ever came out of this country. It is needle&s;s to mention, they were entirely &s;poiled before dinner was over. The &s;herbet, which is the liquor they drink at meals, was &s;erved in china bowls; but the covers and &s;alvers were ma&s;&s;ive gold. After dinner, water was brought in gold ba&s;ons, and towels of the &s;ame kind with the napkins, which I very unwillingly wiped my hands upon; and coffee was &s;erved in china, with gold <HI>&s;oucoups</HI> or &s;aucers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week, &s;he adds, their cookery plea&s;ed me extremely, but after that, I began to grow weary of their table; but I attribute this to cu&s;tom, and am very much inclined to believe that an Indian, who had never ta&s;ted of either, would prefer their cookery to
<PB N="324" REF="333">
ours. Their &s;auces are very high, all the roa&s;ts very much done. They u&s;e a great deal of very rich &s;pice. The &s;oup is &s;erved for the la&s;t di&s;h; and they have at lea&s;t as great a variety of ragouts as we have. The entertainment always concludes with coffee and per|fumes, at the tables of the &s;ultanas; and after this cere|mony, they command their &s;laves to dance, and play on their guitars.</P>
<P>The luxury of the ba&s;haws and great men of the Porte, in regard to the furniture of their hou&s;es is exce&s;&s;ive. Baron <HI>Tott</HI>'s de&s;cription of the chamber in which he and his lady &s;lept at a country villa be|longing to one of the Grand Signor's dragomen, where he went for a few days on a vi&s;it, will &s;erve to give &s;ome faint idea of the general magnificence of the apartments of their great men, added to what we have already extracted from Lady <HI>M.</HI> re&s;pecting the palaces of the &s;ultanas in Adrianople. The time for taking our repo&s;e was now come, and we were conducted, &s;ays he, into another large room, in the middle of which was a kind of bed without bed&s;tead or curtains; though the coverlid and pillows exceeded in magnificence the richne&s;s of the &s;opha, which, likewi&s;e, ornamented the apartment. Fifteen mattre&s;&s;es of quilted cotton about three inches thick, placed one upon another, formed the ground-work, and were covered by a &s;heet of Indian linen, &s;ewed on the la&s;t mattre&s;s. A coverlet of green &s;atin, adorned with gold embroidery in em|bo&s;&s;ed
<PB N="325" REF="334">
work, was in like manner fa&s;tened to the &s;heet, the ends of which turned in, were &s;ewed down alter|nately. Two large pillows of crim&s;on &s;atin overlaid with the like embroidery, in which there was no want of gold or &s;pangles, re&s;ted on two cu&s;hions of the &s;opha, brought near to &s;erve for a back, and intended to &s;upport our heads. A &s;mall octagonal tower inlaid with ebony and mother of pearl, &s;tood by the &s;ide of the bed, and &s;erved for a table; upon it was placed a large &s;ilver candle&s;tick, which held a yellow wax can|dle two inches thick, and three feet high, the wick of which, nearly as thick as one's finger, produced a very di&s;agreeable &s;moke. Three china &s;alvers, filled with con&s;erves of ro&s;es, flowers of orange, and lemon peel, with a little golden &s;patula, the handle of tortoi&s;e&s;hell, to &s;erve for a &s;poon, and cry&s;tal ve&s;&s;el full of water, &s;urrounded this ob&s;cure luminary, which was intended to burn all night: a precaution not to be neglected in a country where there is &s;o much rea&s;on to fear the ravages of fire. Such were our accommodations at the dragoman's; and I could not but expect to pa&s;s a very indifferent night. The taking of the pillows entirely away would not have been a bad re&s;ource, if we had had any bol&s;ter, and the expedient of turning the other &s;ide upwards only &s;erved to &s;hew they were embroi|dered on both &s;ides. We at la&s;t determined to lay our handkerchiefs over them, but this did not prevent our being &s;en&s;ible of the embo&s;&s;ed ornaments under|neath. It will readily be &s;uppo&s;ed we were no &s;lug|gards;
<PB N="326" REF="335">
and indeed it was with no &s;mall &s;atisfaction we &s;aw the morning appear, re&s;olving to procure more commodious pillows the night following.</P>
<P>In their cu&s;toms, adds the baron, they &s;eem as fond of imitating us, (the French) as the French are of imitating the Engli&s;h. I have &s;een a Greek lady at Con&s;tantinople, take olives up with her fingers at din|ner, and afterwards put them on a fork, to eat them after the French fa&s;hion. If the drinking of healths be no longer the mode with the French, it is not the le&s;s agreeable to find this ancient practice &s;till remain|ing in other countries. Our Greeks did not omit this ceremony, and the men even performed it &s;tanding, with their heads uncovered: and what may appear le&s;s refined, the &s;ame tumbler of wine &s;erved the whole circle of gue&s;ts. After dinner, in which there was more profu&s;ion than elegance, the company &s;eated them&s;elves upon a &s;opha, in the &s;ame room in which it had been &s;erved up. Pipes &s;ucceeded coffee; they began a conver&s;ation on the fa&s;hions, which concluded in &s;candal, and in this too I found their imitation of French manners very perfect. In the mean time the young girls amu&s;ed them&s;elves with a &s;wing, hung at the other end of the room, which &s;ome &s;laves put in motion; the women, likewi&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of partaking in this amu&s;ement, and were placed in the machine, and their places when vacant, were &s;upplied by our gentlemen with long beards. The games of back|gammon,
<PB N="327" REF="336">
che&s;s, and panguelo, a kind of berlan, con|cluded the diver&s;ions of the day.</P>
<P>This Greek, as well as all tho&s;e who are &s;ufficiently opulent to imitate the Turks, was accu&s;tomed to &s;leep after dinner on his &s;opha, while a woman by driving away the flies with a great fan made of feathers, ren|dered the air he breathed cool, and refre&s;hing; other &s;laves, on their knees at his feet, rubbed them gently with their hands. This A&s;iatic luxury would, no doubt, permit &s;u&s;picion to go greater lengths, with re&s;pect to the&s;e particulars; and his ill u&s;age of the &s;laves for the mo&s;t trifling offences, &s;hould convince us that where the facility of gratifying our de&s;ires is unbounded, all &s;en&s;e of delicacy and feeling is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Turks have &s;eldom any chimnies in their hou&s;es, but they have &s;omething far better and more agreeable to warm them&s;elves by in winter; this is a chafing-di&s;h placed under a table covered with a large quilted counterpane: tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of warm|ing them&s;elves put this counterpane upon their knees, and by that means a very agreeable warmth is com|municated to all parts of the body. In the hou&s;es of the Turki&s;h nobles, a &s;mall covering of &s;ilk or &s;atin brocaded in gold or &s;ilver, is thrown over the large one, worked by &s;ome of the ladies of the family.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="337">The middle rank of people among the Turks, have no other chamber to &s;leep in, than that which &s;erves them to live in during the day. A &s;lave comes about the time that the family u&s;ually retires to re&s;t, and &s;preads a mattre&s;s for each per&s;on, over which he puts a quilt for a covering, and a pillow to re&s;t the head upon. The Turks do not undre&s;s them&s;elves, as we do; but &s;leep in their drawers and wai&s;tcoats. In the morning the &s;lave comes again, rolls up the mattre&s;&s;es and quilts in a bundle, and carries them to the clo&s;et from whence he took them.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual mode of &s;alutation among the Turks is, a little inclination of the head without taking off the turban; and laying the right hand to the brea&s;t. Their u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion on this occa&s;ion is, <HI>Peace be with you;</HI> to which the reply is nearly &s;imilar, <HI>Peace be with you, and the mercy of God.</HI> It appears from &s;cripture, this was the ancient manner of &s;alutation, and is a very grave one. When it is a per&s;on of di&s;tinction whom they &s;alute, they bow &s;o low as to take up the hem of his garment, and ki&s;s it.</P>
<P>Among other things in which the Turks differ from us, is the place of honour; they look upon the left hand to be more honourable than the right, becau&s;e it is the &s;ide on which the &s;word is worn, and con&s;equently a per&s;on has the command of his arms who walks on the right hand. No Europeans, however, as we have
<PB N="329" REF="338">
ob&s;erved before, wear &s;words in Turkey, nor do even the Jani&s;&s;aries them&s;elves ever wear their &s;abres, except they are going on actual &s;ervice. Another particular in which the Turks differ very much from the Chri&s;tians, is the &s;having of their heads and letting their beards and whi&s;kers grow to a great length; and the larger and longer they are, the more a man is e&s;teemed. They even &s;wear by their beard, and look upon it as a great affront to touch any per&s;on's beard, though it &s;hould be in &s;aluting him, which is a com|mon cu&s;tom among them. As &s;trange as we may think it to &s;ee them with their long beards, they think it equally &s;o to &s;ee us with our long tails and perukes. They have a &s;aying, that the Devil ne&s;tles in a large head of hair; and it is for this rea&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Le Brun,</HI> that they leave on their heads, only a &s;mall tuft of hair.</P>
<P>The Turks, likewi&s;e, make great u&s;e of hot baths, both for the &s;ake of their health and for cleanline&s;s: there is &s;carce a village in Turkey which has not its hot bath. The frequent u&s;e of them, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> opens the pores to &s;uch a degree as to render them vi&s;ible. It is equally certain that &s;o violent a dilatation of the fibres, by altering the &s;hape, brings on decrepitude before old age. Lady <HI>M.</HI> in her de&s;cription of the natural hot baths at Sophia near Adrianople, &s;ays they are built of &s;tone in the &s;hape of a dome, with no win|dows but in the roof, which give light enough. There
<PB N="330" REF="339">
were five of the&s;e domes joining together, the outer|mo&s;t being le&s;s than the re&s;t, and &s;erving only as a hall, where the portre&s;s &s;tood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten &s;hillings. The next room is a very large one, paved with marble, and all round it are two rai&s;ed &s;ophas of marble one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room falling fir&s;t into marble ba&s;ons, and then running on the floor in little chan|nels made for that purpo&s;e, which carried the &s;treams into the next room &s;omething le&s;s than this, with the &s;ame &s;ort of marble &s;ophas; but &s;o hot with &s;teams of &s;ulphur, proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tay there with one's cloaths on. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers plea&s;ed to have. I was in my travelling habit, a riding dre&s;s, and it mu&s;t certainly appear very extraordinary to them; yet there was not one of them &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;ur|prize or impertinent curio&s;ity, but received me with all the obliging civility po&s;&s;ible. I know no European court where the ladies would have behaved them&s;elves in &s;o polite a manner to &s;uch a &s;tranger. I believe upon the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet none of tho&s;e di&s;dainful &s;miles and &s;atirical whi&s;pers, that never fail in our a&s;&s;emblies, when any body appears that is not dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the fa&s;hion. They repeated over and over to me <HI>"Uzelle, pek uzelle,"</HI>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="331" REF="341">
which is nothing but "charming, very charming."&mdash; The fir&s;t &s;ophas were covered with cu&s;hions and rich carpets, on which &s;at the ladies; and on the &s;econd their &s;laves behind them, but without any di&s;tinction of rank by their dre&s;s, all being in the &s;tate of nature, that is in plain Engli&s;h &s;tark naked, without any beauty or defect concealed. Yet there was not the lea&s;t wanton &s;mile or immode&s;t ge&s;ture among them. They walked and moved with the &s;ame maje&s;tic grace, with which <HI>Milton</HI> de&s;cribes our general mother to have walked. There were many among&s;t them, as finely proportioned as any godde&s;s ever was drawn by <HI>Guido</HI> or by <HI>Titian</HI>&mdash;mo&s;t of their &s;kins delicately white, glo&s;|&s;ed with the water and decorated by their beautiful hair, divided into many tre&s;&s;es, hanging on their &s;houlders, and braided either with pearl or ribbon, perfectly repre&s;enting the figure of the Graces.</P>
<P>I was here convinced of the truth of a reflection I have often made&mdash;that if it were the fa&s;hion to go naked, the face would be hardly ob&s;erved. I per|ceived that the ladies of the mo&s;t delicate &s;kins and fine&s;t &s;hapes, had the greate&s;t &s;hare of my admiration, though their faces were &s;ometimes le&s;s beautiful than tho&s;e of their companions. To tell you the truth, I had wickedne&s;s enough to wi&s;h &s;ecretly that Mr. &mdash; the painter, could have been there invi&s;ible. It would have very much improved his art to &s;ee &s;o many fine women naked in different po&s;tures, &s;ome in conver&s;ation, &s;ome
<PB N="332" REF="342">
working, others drinking coffee or &s;herbet, and many lying negligently on their cu&s;hions, while their &s;laves, generally young girls of &s;eventeen or eighteen, were employed in braiding their hair in &s;everal pretty fancies. In &s;hort 'tis the woman's coffee-hou&s;e, where the news of the town is told and &s;candal invented. They generally take this diver&s;ion once a-week, and &s;tay there at lea&s;t four or five hours.</P>
<P>All the men who go into the&s;e baths, either &s;have them&s;elves clean from hair, or extirpate it by a pre|paration, and go into the water naked, except a napkin round their wai&s;t. After they have been &s;ome time in them, one of the &s;laves comes and &s;tretches their legs and arms, bending them backwards and forwards &s;everal times to make the joints &s;upple. He then carries him to another place where are &s;everal cocks of hot water, with which he wa&s;hes him all over with &s;oap and water, and then rubs him thoroughly dry with a camblet bag or &s;ome &s;uch coar&s;e &s;tuff. The&s;e bags are &s;quare, and &s;erve to clean&s;e the body from all manner of filth. They an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of fle&s;h bru&s;hes, u&s;ed by the ancients, which were of metal, and every per&s;on is at liberty to bring his own rubbing cloth. But the Turks who are not very &s;crupulous in drinking after one another out of the &s;ame gla&s;s, and eating off the &s;ame plate, or even in wearing the cloaths of one who died of the plague, make no &s;cruple
<PB N="333" REF="343">
of being rubbed with the &s;ame cloth which another has u&s;ed, provided it be only rinced once or twice.</P>
<P>The obligation which their religion impo&s;es on them to bathe frequently, has occa&s;ioned all their nobles, and great men, to build baths in their own hou&s;es; and they are &s;o expert in the management of them, that the &s;ame fire not only heats their baths, but &s;erves al&s;o to dre&s;s their victuals.</P>
<P>The Mahometans are &s;o extremely particular in their ablutions, that left any accidental dirt upon their bodies &s;hould pollute them, they not only wa&s;h them&s;elves thoroughly in the ordinary bath, but clean&s;e every part of their bodies thoroughly.</P>
<P>Even wa&s;te paper is held in great veneration among the Mahometans; they never putting it to any &s;ordid u&s;e, nor even do they tread on it, le&s;t any part of it &s;hould contain tho&s;e letters with which the name of God is written. If they find a piece in the &s;treet, they take it up, ki&s;s it, and even put it very re&s;pect|fully in &s;ome hole of a wall. This re&s;pect that they have for paper proceeds from the veneration they have for the Alcoran, which when they carry about them, they never &s;uffer to de&s;cend lower than their girdle.</P>
<P>The cleanline&s;s &s;o &s;trongly recommended by the laws of their holy religion, has made them erect nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="334" REF="344">
hou&s;es in different parts of the city, and e&s;peci|cially round about the mo&s;ques, which in their lan|guage they call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dophano</HI> or places of &s;hame.

their morals mo&s;t worthy of imitation is their extreme re&s;ignation to the will of God; they have no word in the Turki&s;h langui&s;h to expre&s;s bla&s;phemy, &s;uch is their veneration for the Deity; and they never &s;peak of un|dertaking any thing without &s;aying "if it plea&s;e God."</P>
<P>U&s;ury is looked upon as a great &s;in, and never practi&s;ed. They are guilty, however, of great extor|tion upon the Franks, but then it is generally through the in&s;tigation of the Jews and Chri&s;tians, who envy one another, and &s;eek each other's ruin.</P>
<P>They are ever loyal to their prince, whom they highly reverence, and to whom they pay implicit obe|dience; are never known to betray him, but ready to die for him whenever he commands it, and never quarrel or fight among them&s;elves, owing to that wi&s;e precept of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> commanding the Turks to ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of wine.</P>
<P>The Turks never engrave any thing upon their &s;eals but the name and age of the per&s;on who is to wear them; their religion forbidding them either to engrave any figure or even to keep any by them. The form of their cornelians is different from ours; they general|ly wear the rings on their fingers cut in the &s;hape of a &s;quare.</P>

<P>The manner of living of a Turk, &s;ufficiently wealthy to have nothing to do, is to go out every day, and take his &s;eat in the &s;hop of a dealer of tobacco. There, under the pretence of trying the different &s;orts, he &s;moaks &s;everal pipes without paying any thing; and be&s;ides enjoys the pro&s;pect of the pa&s;&s;engers; who on their part, admire the indolent gravity of the Turk, and the re&s;pectful demeanour of two or three &s;ervants who &s;tand by his &s;ide, with their hands cro&s;&s;ed before them. In this po&s;ition, the fir&s;t liver-&s;eller who pa&s;&s;es, &s;tops, and brags of his ability to bring together all the cats in the neighbourhood, cracks a &s;ew jokes to divert his excellency, and obtains permi&s;&s;ion to begin his operations. The pa&s;&s;engers gather round; by &s;ome art of his, the cats a&s;&s;emble, in a twinkling; at the watch|word the &s;houlders of the dealer are covered with them, they hang about his cloaths, and he makes ha&s;te to fea&s;t his friends for their alacrity. The important per&s;onage for who&s;e diver&s;ion the &s;cene is intended, pays the performance; and the European, who does not under&s;tand the language, or under&s;tands it but ill, and does not live among the Turks to &s;tudy their

genius and manners, believes he has &s;een an act of charity, publi&s;hes it as &s;uch, and only propagates an error, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> who &s;eems to view every action of the Turks with an evil eye.</P>
<P>As a proof of their exce&s;&s;ive indolence, Lady <HI>C.</HI> mentions having &s;een a Turk lying on cu&s;hions, &s;triking &s;lowly an iron, which he was &s;haping into a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, his pipe in his mouth all the time: nay, what is more, among the higher order of the Turks there is an invention which &s;aves them the trouble of holding the pipe, two &s;mall wheels are fixed on each &s;ide the bowl of the pipe, and thus the &s;moaker has only to puff away, or let the pipe re&s;t upon his under lip, while he moves his hand as he plea&s;es. Perhaps it is fortunate for Europe that the Turks are idle and ignorant; the immen&s;e power this empire might have, were it peopled by the indu&s;trious and the ambitious, would make it the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. At pre&s;ent it only &s;erves as a dead wall to intercept the commerce and battles which other powers might create with one another.</P>
<P>The quiet and pa&s;&s;ive Turk will &s;it a whole day by the &s;ide of a canal, looking at kites flying or children's boats. I &s;aw one, &s;ays Lady <HI>C.</HI> who was enjoying the &s;hade of an immen&s;e plantane tree, his eyes fixed on a kind of bottle, diverted by the noi&s;e and motion of it, while the &s;tream kept it in motion. How the
<PB N="338" REF="348">
bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, under &s;uch indolence can go on, &s;eems extraordinary: the cabinet is compo&s;ed general|ly of ignorant mercenaries; the Vizir was only a water-carrier to the high-admiral, the high admiral him&s;elf only a &s;ervant in Algiers:&mdash;This was in the year 1776. Places are obtained at the Porte by intrigue; each placeman, each &s;ultane&s;s has her creatures to provide for, and their plots to promote them. Ver|&s;ailles has not more intricate intrigue than the Porte; is it to be then wondered at, that the Turk is a prede&s;|tinarian in mo&s;t things, &s;ince it is neither birth nor abi|lities that give him place or power, nor is there gene|rally any vi&s;ible or ju&s;t rea&s;on why heads are &s;truck off?</P>
<P>The populace at Con&s;tantinople are more in&s;olent than in other countries; &s;o much &s;o, that it is by no means &s;afe for a &s;tranger to walk the &s;treets unaccom|panied by a Jani&s;&s;ary. A Greek lady, &s;ays <HI>Bi&s;ani,</HI> return|ing home through a great crowd of Turks that were a&s;&s;embled together on &s;ome occa&s;ion, one of them &s;aid, in the hearing of her interpreter, Oh! how I &s;hould like to blow out the brains of that infidel! At another time a Turk having met a poor Greek as he was walk|ing out, &s;topped him, and &s;aid this day I promi&s;ed to offer up to God and his prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> the head of an in&s;idel, and immediately &s;hot him dead. He kept out of the way for a few days, but having in the mean time obtained his pardon from the relations of the de|cea&s;ed, by means of a &s;um of money, appeared again
<PB N="339" REF="349">
with more in&s;olence than ever. When we were at the Dardanelles, adds this author, one of my friends walk|ing by him&s;elf on the &s;ea-&s;hore, was knocked down by a party of Turks without the lea&s;t provocation, merely as they &s;aid, for the &s;ake of buffetting a Chri&s;tian. Such is the character of the common people, who always carry their zeal for religion to great lengths.</P>
<P>The fury of the Turks, however, rarely breaks out in ha&s;ty violence; they never fight duels, but they a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate; and it is in this manner all their quarrels terminate, for they &s;eldom if ever come to an accom|modation. The offended party publickly &s;harpens his knife or prepares his fire-arms; &s;ome friends en|deavour to appea&s;e, others to excite and encourage him to the murder; but no means are taken to pre|vent the crime threatened by the&s;e preparations. Its commi&s;&s;ion however mu&s;t be preceded by intoxication. Wine in&s;pires the Turk with the courage nece&s;&s;ary for the gratification of his revenge; having worked him&s;elf up to the proper pitch, he &s;allies forth from the tavern, and from that time the offender has no hopes of &s;afety, but from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of his antagoni&s;t. If the murder be effected, and the guards who never have any other arms but &s;taves, pur&s;ue the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, he will then give proofs of real courage, and defend him|&s;elf like a lion; guilt &s;eems to have ennobled him; and if he be overpowered, the threats of his comrades terrify the relations of the decea&s;ed into an accommodation,
<PB N="340" REF="350">
which leaves the criminal in full enjoyment of the high e&s;teem he has acquired by this heroic action. This is no exaggeration: Such a one has killed this or that man is never &s;aid, but by way of panegyric; he who has killed ten, is the hero of his quarter; there is no merry-making without him; his friend&s;hip is e&s;teemed a &s;afeguard.</P>
<P>It is therefore only &s;ome hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, among the Turks, &s;ome Chri&s;tians or Jews who furni&s;h examples of public puni&s;hment, as an atonement for the crimes they have committed. In this ca&s;e, the culprit is brought to the Porte, and there receives his &s;entence, the execution of which, is attended with no &s;olemn parade; they may even be &s;een &s;ometimes pu&s;hing through the crowd, and talking all the way with him, who is to execute them. The criminals only have their hands tied, and the hangman holds them by their girdle; then is the time to negociate with the friends of the decea&s;ed, and to endeavour to bring about the accommodation. There have been bargains of this kind broken off merely through the avarice of the per|&s;on condemned. Such a&s;&s;ertions &s;eem beyond the bounds of probability; but if they be true, it is doubt|le&s;s, becau&s;e under de&s;potic governments, riches are of much importance, life of but little.</P>
<P>Nothing is wanting to complete the barbarity of the Turks, &s;ays Baron <HI>Tott,</HI> but to imitate the late cu&s;tom
<PB N="341" REF="351">
of the French, in extending the puni&s;hment of a crime, &s;o as to load with infamy tho&s;e innocent per&s;ons who have the misfortune of being related to the criminal. But they, on the contrary, engrave on his tomb-&s;tone the name of the decea&s;ed, and the puni&s;hment he &s;uf|fered. I have known, continued he, a European very ill received by a Grecian lady of con&s;equence, who&s;e hu&s;band had been hanged for &s;ome intrigue at court; becau&s;e he thought proper to lament her mi&s;|fortune, and dwelt particularly on the kind of death the decea&s;ed had &s;uffered. What kind of death would you wi&s;h him to have died? cried the lady in a rage: know, &s;ir, that no per&s;on of my family ever died like a Baccal. A baccal is a retail grocer; they commonly die in their beds; it is this low &s;tation of life which is u&s;ually oppo&s;ed by the Turks to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. The European was thunder&s;truck, and left her, wi&s;hing each of her relations a like reputable end.</P>
<P>Murder is never pur&s;ued by the king's-officers as with us. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the next relations to re|venge the dead per&s;on; and if they like better to com|pound the matter for money (as they generally do) there is no more &s;aid about it. It is natural to &s;up|po&s;e that this de&s;ect in their government, &s;hould make &s;uch tragedies very frequent; on the contrary, they are extremely rare; and proves that the people are not cruel by nature. I do not think, &s;ays Lady <HI>M.</HI> they de&s;erve, in general, the barbarous character we
<PB N="342" REF="352">
give them. I am well acquainted with a Chri&s;tian woman of quality, who made it her choice to live with a Turki&s;h hu&s;band. She was a Spaniard, and at Na|ples with her family; coming from thence in a felucca, accompanied by her brother, &s;he was attacked by the Turki&s;h admiral, boarded and taken. The &s;ame ac|cident happened to her that happened to the fair <HI>Lucretia</HI> &s;o many years before her. But &s;he was too good a Chri&s;tian to kill her&s;elf as the heatheni&s;h Roman did. The admiral was &s;o much charmed with the beauty and long &s;uffering of the fair captive, that, as his fir&s;t compliment, he gave immediately liberty to her brother and attendants, who made ha&s;te to Spain, and in a few months &s;ent the &s;um of four thou&s;and pounds, as a ran&s;om for his &s;i&s;ter. The Turk took the money, which he pre&s;ented to her, and told her &s;he was at her liberty. But the lady very di&s;creetly weigh|ed the different treatment &s;he was likely to find in her native country. Her relations (as the kinde&s;t thing they could do for her in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances) would certainly confine her to a nunnery for the re&s;t of her days. Her infidel lover was very hand&s;ome, very tender, very fond of her, and lavi&s;hed at her feet all the Turki&s;h magnificence. She an&s;wered him very re&s;olutely, that her liberty was not &s;o precious to her as her honour; and as he could no way re&s;tore that, but by marrying her, &s;he reque&s;ted him to accept the ran|&s;om as her portion, and let her have the &s;atisfaction of knowing that no man could boa&s;t of her favours
<PB N="343" REF="353">
without being her hu&s;band. The admiral tran&s;ported at this liberal propo&s;al, &s;ent back the money to her relations, &s;aying he was too happy in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to need a reward to keep her. He con&s;equently married her, took no other wife, and the lady as &s;he her&s;elf declared, never had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to repent the choice &s;he had made. It may be &s;aid that &s;he fell in love with her ravi&s;her; it is, however, more candid to pre&s;ume that &s;he acted wholly on motives of honour, though &s;he might naturally be &s;truck with his gene|ro&s;ity&mdash;a principle found among the Turks of rank.</P>
<P>It is a degree of genero&s;ity to tell the truth, and it is very rare that any Turk will a&s;&s;ert a &s;olemn fal&s;e|hood. I don't &s;peak of the lower &s;ort, for as there is a great deal of ignorance, &s;o there is very little virtue among them; and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are much cheaper than in Chri&s;tian countries; &s;uch wretches not being puni&s;hed (even when they are publicly detected) with the rigour they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>In order to avoid the effects of debauchery among the common people, the taverns are &s;hut up on their &s;olemn fe&s;tivals. The &s;eal of police is affixed to the door of every tavern; but a little wicket is contrived underneath, which affords an entrance, and requires only a little &s;tooping to evade the law, and get drunk unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="354">The three days of the Bayram, occa&s;ion &s;ome &s;oli|citude on the part of government, to prevent the di&s;orders which may ari&s;e from intoxication. The Ramazan, which precedes the holidays, is the lunar month, appointed for a fa&s;t, and the time when it happens annually, advances eleven days. The time of ab&s;tinence, which <HI>Mahomet</HI> has copied from the Lent of Chri&s;tians, con&s;i&s;ts among the Turks, as that did in the primitive church, in taking no nouri&s;hment while the &s;un is above the horizon. It is therefore ea&s;y to perceive, that the Ramazans, which fall near the winter &s;ol&s;tice, are much le&s;s difficult to ob&s;erve than tho&s;e which happen in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, from the exce&s;&s;ive heat and length of the days which accompany this &s;ea&s;on of fa&s;ting. But the cla&s;s of labouring people &s;eems alone to bear all the rigour of the Rama|zan. Deprived during the day of a gla&s;s of water to quench their thir&s;t, or even refre&s;h their lips, the &s;etting of the &s;un only brings them a frugal repa&s;t and &s;hort repo&s;e, to be &s;hortly interrupted by the hour of prayer, and quick return of day.</P>
<P>This fa&s;t wears a quite different appearance among per&s;ons of fortune; it is only luxury &s;leeping in the arms of hypocri&s;y, and awaking merely to give it&s;elf up to good cheer, mu&s;ic, and whatever can recompence &s;en&s;uality for the unea&s;ine&s;s of ab&s;tinence.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="355">Obliged to wait the time pre&s;cribed by law, and anxious to &s;ee it arrive, a Turk, during the Ramazan, is perpetually counting the hours and minutes, &s;ur|rounded by all the clocks and watches he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. It is then that Geneva receives the greater part of that tribute which its indu&s;try impo&s;es on the Turks. But the mo&s;t regular watch is not &s;ufficient to deter|mine the moment of the ending of the fa&s;t. It is an|nounced by the criers of the mo&s;ques placed in the galleries, the minarets, who ob&s;erve there the di&s;ap|pearance of the &s;un, and he of Sancta Sophia gives the fir&s;t &s;ignal. At that in&s;tant the impatience of the Turks knows no bounds, and they in&s;tantly &s;eize on their pipes, this being the fir&s;t of their wants.</P>
<P>Yet if the Turks wait till the &s;un di&s;appears before they allow them&s;elves any nouri&s;hment, they take no le&s;s care to a&s;certain the commencement of their new moon, when the Ramazan begins. They have in general but little confidence in a&s;tronomical calcula|tions, except as the commencement of a fe&s;tival. It is al&s;o remarked, that the moon dedicated to ab&s;tinence has commonly but twenty-eight days, and the per&s;ons appointed to ob&s;erve this planet always perceive a little of the late&s;t, the fir&s;t ray of light of the Ramazan moon; but, to make amends, are far le&s;s &s;crupulous in announcing the appearance of that which begins the Bayram, and is u&s;hered in by a di&s;charge of artillery from all the different batteries.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="356">The &s;ea&s;on of the Bayram is al&s;o a &s;ea&s;on of luxury; every individual procures, gives, or receives new dre&s;&s;es. It is likewi&s;e the time for parties of plea&s;ure of all kinds, which u&s;ually produce di&s;orders and op|pre&s;&s;ion on the part of the Turks; who, new cloathed and well armed, are &s;pread in every village for three or four leagues round Con&s;tantinople, and think they may commit every extravagance with impunity, and exact what they plea&s;e from the unfortunate Greeks.</P>
<P>There are no theatres, no ma&s;querades, nor any public amu&s;ements at Con&s;tantinople, except the <HI>Donalma,</HI> or rejoicings on the birth of the Grand Sig|nor's children. Fourteen days fe&s;tivity are allowed when the fir&s;t child is born, whether prince or prince&s;s; and &s;even for the re&s;t. All the bezars, khans, and other public buildings, are illuminated, not excepting the mo&s;ques, upon who&s;e turrets lamps are placed, and kept burning all night. The &s;treets are, likewi&s;e, illuminated, and the &s;hops kept open, to di&s;play every rare and &s;plendid commodity, not for &s;ale but for ornament; no trade being &s;uffered during the&s;e public rejoicings. The common people are every where in perpetual motion, running up and down the &s;treets, and entering the hou&s;es of per&s;ons of rank, who &s;it upon &s;ophas in an outer apartment, finely illuminated, to receive all kinds of vi&s;itors, who may freely &s;eat them&s;elves on the &s;ophas of the fir&s;t officers of &s;tate, even upon that, on which the grand vizir him&s;elf

is &s;eated; who is obliged to offer refre&s;hments at his own expence to all comers, in honour of the emperor, who may po&s;&s;ibly be one of his gue&s;ts in di&s;gui&s;e. This circum&s;tance, and their knowing if he is not pre|&s;ent, that he is well informed of every thing that pa&s;&s;es, makes the Turki&s;h nobility, and particularly the great officers of &s;tate, exert their utmo&s;t efforts to di&s;play the greate&s;t magnificence and ho&s;pitality po&s;&s;ible on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; for their fortune often depends on the expence they put them&s;elves to, in honour of this fe&s;tival; &s;ome of them having been promoted on ac|count of their liberality, and others turned out of their office, and di&s;graced, for their penuriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>An infinite number of little troops of dancers and &s;ingers di&s;tribute them&s;elves in all parts of the city, and are well paid for contributing to the public joy. No per&s;on can be taken up for any crime during the <HI>Donalma,</HI> and pri&s;oners are &s;et at liberty, provided they can find &s;ecurity for returning to their pri&s;ons when the rejoicings are over. In a word, it is a per|fect carnival, and more &s;plendid than that of Venice. But the per&s;ons who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves mo&s;t on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are the foreign mini&s;ters, who do it at the expence of their &s;overeigns, and at the &s;ame time gain the good will of the Grand Signor. Prince <HI>Repnin,</HI> amba&s;&s;ador from Ru&s;&s;ia, was too great a poli|tician to be &s;paring of expence during the <HI>Donalma</HI> that happened in his time. On the contrary, &s;ays
