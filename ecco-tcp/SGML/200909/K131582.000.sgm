<HEAD>INFORMATION FOR CHARLES HUTTON, Shipma&s;ter in Cul|ro&s;s, Su&s;pender, AGAINST WILLIAM PALMER of Great Yarmouth, in the County of Norfolk, and DAVID MACLAREN, Merchant in Leith, his Attorney, Chargers.</HEAD>
<P>LORD ESKGROVE is to report to your Lord&s;hips a que&s;tion with regard to the property of a ve&s;&s;el captured by a French privateer, and purcha&s;ed from the captor by the &s;u&s;pender. The circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e are &s;omewhat &s;ingular, and are as follow.</P>
<P>In May 1782, the &s;u&s;pender &s;ailed from the frith of Forth to Gottenburg, in a ve&s;&s;el of which he him&s;elf was owner. He ar|rived in &s;afety at Gottenburg, where he took in a cargo of timber and iron; but on his voyage home had the misfortune to be taken by a French privateer, the Fearnought of Dunkirk, Jo&s;eve Ma|gray commander. The &s;u&s;pender was taken upon the 10th July 1782; and Captain Magray having put part of his crew into the &s;u&s;pender's ve&s;&s;el, &s;ent her into a port in France or Holland. The &s;u&s;pender and his crew were kept pri&s;oners aboard the French pri|vateer.</P>
<P>Captain Magray having in this manner di&s;po&s;ed of his prize, continued his crui&s;e; and upon the 20th July he gave chace to a
<PB N="2" REF="2">ve&s;&s;el, the crew of which, upon his approach, took to their long|boat, and made their e&s;cape. Upon boarding the ve&s;&s;el, Captain Magray found that there was not a &s;ingle per&s;on in her: but a variety of circum&s;tances, independent of the flight of the crew, put it beyond all doubt that &s;he was a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, and as &s;uch Captain Magray &s;eized her as lawful prize.</P>
<P>Upon examining the prize he had thus made, Captain Magray found that &s;he was of no great value. She was in balla&s;t, had no cargo whatever on board, and did not &s;eem to be a ve&s;&s;el of much value. Had &s;he been more valuable than &s;he was, Captain Magray could not have &s;pared a &s;ufficient number of hands to carry her into port: he therefore took her in tow, and carried her along with him. This however proved trouble&s;ome; and after having kept her in company for &s;ome days, Captain Magray took a re&s;olution to &s;ink her, that he might be more fully at liberty to proceed in his crui&s;e. After he had formed this re&s;o|lution, and when he was about to put it in execution, it occur|red to the French captain, that perhaps the &s;u&s;pender and his pri|&s;oners might give him &s;omething for the ve&s;&s;el, as thereby they would recover their liberty &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e they could ex|pect to do. The &s;u&s;pender, as might be expected, very readily li&s;tened to the propo&s;ition, and by the terms of the bargain it was at length &s;ettled, that the &s;u&s;pender &s;hould pay 150 guineas, as the price of the ve&s;&s;el; and in &s;ecurity of that &s;um one of the &s;u&s;|pender's crew offered to go as a ho&s;tage.</P>
<P>This agreement was reduced into writing, and is conceived in the following terms:</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of this agreement, which the &s;u&s;pender con&s;i|&s;idered
<PB N="3" REF="3">as in every re&s;pect to be fair, legal, and proper, he got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el, and brought her home to Scotland. Up|on examining into her condition, he found that &s;he was in bad order, and &s;tood greatly in need of repairs. He thereupon, in the full belief that &s;he was his ab&s;olute property, pro|ceeded to give her a thorough repair, and then made one voyage in her to Gottenburg. Upon his return, the ve&s;&s;el was arre&s;ted at the in&s;tance of the charger, Mr Palmer, who alledged, that he was the original owner of the ve&s;&s;el, and in&s;i&s;ted that in that cha|racter he was intitled to reclaim her, the property not having been properly ve&s;ted in the French captor, or legally tran&s;mitted to the &s;u&s;pender by the tran&s;action above mentioned. The charger there|upon brought an action before the high court of admiralty, again&s;t the &s;u&s;pender, concluding, <Q>That it &s;hould be found and declared by &s;entence and decreet of the judge of the &s;aid high court of ad|miralty, that the brigantine or ve&s;&s;el formerly called <HI>the Peggie of Yarmouth,</HI> now <HI>the Peggie of Culro&s;s,</HI> was, and is &s;till, the property of the pur&s;uer and Nathaniel Palmer, and ought to be delivered up to them: And, further, the &s;aid Charles Hutton ought and &s;hould be decerned and ordained to make payment to the pur&s;uer, or his attorney, for his behoof, of the &s;um of L. 300 Sterling of profits and freights earned by him while he has been in the illegal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;aid brigantine, as al&s;o of the &s;um of L. 50 Sterling of expences of proce&s;s,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Defences were given in upon the part of the &s;u&s;pender; on ad|vi&s;ing which, with an&s;wers, the judge of the high court of admi|ralty pronounced the following interlocutor. <Q>Finds,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 6.1782.</NOTE> That the property of the &s;hip in di&s;pute mu&s;t be held to have remained with the pur&s;uer; therefore repels the defences, and ordains the brigantine or ve&s;&s;el libelled, with her float-boat, furni|ture, and apparelling, to be forthwith re&s;tored and delivered up by the defender to the pur&s;uer, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by him as he &s;hall think proper; and decerns and ordains the fore&s;aid brigantine or ve&s;&s;el libelled, with her float-boat, furniture, and apparelling, to be forthwith re&s;tored and delivered by the &s;aid Charles Hutton to the &s;aid pur&s;uer.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender offered a reclaiming petition; upon advi&s;ing which, with an&s;wers, the judge pronounced the following inter|locutor. <Q>Having con&s;idered the foregoing petition, and the an&s;wers made thereto, refu&s;es the de&s;ire of the &s;aid petition, and ad|heres to the former interlocutor and decreet of date 6th December
<PB N="4" REF="4">la&s;t; ordains the defender, again&s;t the 2d February next, to give in to court a particular account of the debur&s;ements made, and the profits gained by him, on the voyage or voyages made by the &s;hip libelled, during the time he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; with certification.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender offered a bill of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, which was pa&s;&s;ed of con&s;ent. The charger afterwards applied by petition to the court, for a remit to di&s;cu&s;s the rea&s;ons &s;ummarily upon the bill; and the court did accordingly remit <Q>to Lord E&s;kgrove Ordinary, before whom the bill of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was pre&s;ented, to call and hear parties thereon, and to di&s;cu&s;s the rea&s;ons thereof &s;um|marily, and to do therein as he &s;hall &s;ee ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this remit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1.1783.</NOTE> parties were heard in his Lord|&s;hip's pre&s;ence, when he appointed both parties to give in memo|rials; and upon advi&s;ing the&s;e memorials, his Lord&s;hip pronoun|ced the following interlocutor.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11.1783.</NOTE> <Q>The Lord Ordinary having con&s;idered this memorial, with the memorial for Captain Charles Hutton, and cau&s;ed call the cau&s;e, makes avi&s;andum to the whole Lords with the whole cau&s;e; and appoints the parties to prepare informations, and lodge the &s;ame in the Lords boxes again&s;t the 22d day of April next.</Q></P>
<P>In obedience to this appointment, this information is humbly offered upon the part of the &s;u&s;pender.</P>
<P>The charger Mr Palmer claims the ve&s;&s;el now in que&s;tion upon two &s;eparate grounds, 1<HI>mo,</HI> He contends, That by the capture, the property of the ve&s;&s;el was not ve&s;ted in the captor, &s;o as to intitle him to transfer the &s;ame to the &s;u&s;pender by the tran&s;action above mentioned; 2<HI>do,</HI> The charger maintains, That the pre&s;ent ca&s;e falls under an act pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, in|titled, <Q>An act to prohibit the ran&s;oming of &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els cap|tured from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and of the merchandi&s;e or goods on board &s;uch &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els;</Q> and that on that account it was unlawful and improper in the &s;u&s;pender to enter into this tran&s;action with the captor.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the fir&s;t of the&s;e points, a general que&s;tion oc|curs, at what time the property of goods taken from an enemy ve&s;ts in the captor? With regard to this general que&s;tion, which, from its nature, mu&s;t ever be arbitrary, the writers on the law of nations have di&s;&s;ered widely in opinion; and the practice of dif|ferent &s;tates has been equally various. Thus much is plain, that
<PB N="5" REF="5">the only purpo&s;e of fixing any rule, is to a&s;certain and determine the intere&s;t of the original owner and of the recaptor, where &s;hips or goods &s;eized by an enemy, happen to be retaken. It is only in this ca&s;e that it is of importance to e&s;tabli&s;h any rule; for where the thing taken remains with the enemy, the original owner, from whom it was &s;eized as lawful prize, has no claim. The only right that remains with him is a right to follow, and to recover, if he can, the &s;hip, or other &s;ubject, which was &s;eized by the enemy. If he &s;ucceed in this, the &s;ubject returns to him, and again becomes his property; but if he fail, if it be retained by the enemy till the conclu&s;ion of the war, his right is gone for ever, and never can a|gain revive. Between, therefore, the &s;ubjects of &s;tates engaged in a war, the general rule is, that <HI>quae ab ho&s;tibus captae &s;tatim capien|tium fiunt.</HI> The moment a prize is made, the property ve&s;ts in the captor; and all that remains with the original owner is the chance of retaking what has thus been &s;eized by the enemy. When therefore the prize remains with the enemy, there is no room for any doubt, or for any nice di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as to the time when the property ve&s;ts in the captor; for if it be lawful to &s;eize the goods of an enemy, tho&s;e goods mu&s;t of cour&s;e remain the property of the captor, where the enemy is not &s;o fortunate as to retake them. But on the other hand, in the ca&s;e of a recap|ture, it is of importance to a&s;certain what effect the capture by the enemy is to have. If the &s;imple act of &s;eizing a &s;hip dive&s;t the original owner, and ve&s;t the property in the captor, it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow, that where the &s;hip is retaken, the recaptor is in|titled to con&s;ider it as the property of the enemy, and as &s;uch to in&s;i&s;t that it &s;hall remain with him as a lawful prize, to the exclu|&s;ion of the original owner.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain therefore, in &s;uch ca&s;es, the intere&s;t of the origi|nal owner, and of the recaptor, it became nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h regulations with regard to the effects of a capture, and how far it ought to dive&s;t the original owner, and to ve&s;t the property in the captor. Upon this point, there is an equal diver&s;ity in the opinions of lawyers, as in the practice of different nations. With regard to the Roman law, it has been a matter of much doubt, and of much controver&s;y, what rule truly obtained by that law. Upon the one hand, it has been maintained by many eminent writers, that the property of moveables was not ve&s;ted in the captor till they were brought <HI>infra prae&s;idia.</HI> On the other
<PB N="6" REF="6">hand, it has been maintained with equal confidence, that the &s;ingle act of &s;eizing them in&s;tantly transferred the property to the captor. This opinion Voet lays down in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms. His words are: <Q>Et quamvis Hugoni Grotio, de jure belli, liber 3. cap. 9. num. 16. alii&s;que placeat, praedam per ho&s;tes captam tum demum eorum fieri propriam naturali ratione, cum intra prae&s;idia ho&s;tium delata fuit; Arg. L. t. 44. ff. De acquir. rer. do|min. l. 8. &sect; ult. ff. familiae erci&s;c. l. inii 5. &sect; 1. ff. h. t.; verius tamen, etiam ante per &s;olam occupationem dominium praedae ho|&s;tibus acquiri; cum naturali ratione dominia rerum a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ione coeperint; et uti coelo, mari, terra capta &s;tatim capienti cedunt, ita quoque bello capta, quae &s;uperioribus in eo comparantur a Paulo in l. 1. &sect; 1. ff. De acquir. vel. amit. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;. Ade&s;t certe in ho&s;te capiente naturalis apprehen&s;io, ade&s;t animus acquirendi, ade&s;t ju&s;ta acquirendi cau&s;a in belli jure, adeo|que concurrunt ea omnia quae ad dominium acquirendum &s;unt nece&s;&s;aria, etiam antequam res captae intra prae&s;idia deductae fuerint. Et &s;ane ni ita &s;tatuas, dominiumque ho&s;tibus ne|ges donec intra prae&s;idia res delatae fuerint, dicendum foret id quod unus militum manipulus occupavit, per alium mani|pulum &s;ocium et amicum, &s;ed numero&s;iorem, po&s;&s;e iterum au|ferri, qua&s;i id nondum manipuli primo capientis, &s;ed adhuc ho&s;tium res e&s;&s;et; quod utique ab&s;urdum e&s;t. Nec repugnat d. l. 5. &sect; 1. ff. h. t. cum tantum dicat civem per ho&s;tes captum li|berum manere quamdiu intra prae&s;idia delatus non e&s;t, quod ita favore libertatis ut multa alia inductum ad res trahendum non e&s;t;</Q> lib. 49. tit. 15. De captiv. &sect; 3.</P>
<P>But although Grotius was of opinion, that by the Roman law <HI>deductio intra prae&s;idia</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to transfer the property to the captor; yet he is equally clear, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary now among the modern nations in Europe. With regard to &s;hips particularly, he lays it down in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;s terms, that <Q>recentiori jure gentium inter Europeos popu|los introductum videmus, ut talia capta cen&s;eantur, ubi <HI>per ho|ras viginti quatuor</HI> in pote&s;tate ho&s;tium fuerint.</Q></P>
<P>This rule has been followed by mo&s;t of the writers on the law of nations, and has been adopted in many of the &s;tates of Eu|rope. It mu&s;t however be admitted, that it has not been appro|ved of by all the writers on the law of nations. Bynkershoeck, in particular, has laboured with much ingenuity, and with much
<PB N="7" REF="7">learning, to &s;how that it was ab&s;urd to make the right of the captor depend upon the number of hours the ve&s;&s;el was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and though he admits the difficulty of e&s;tabli&s;hing any general rule, he &s;eems to be of opinion, that &s;o long as the original owner has a rea&s;onable <HI>&s;pes recuperandi,</HI> the property &s;hould not be held to be ve&s;ted in the captor: and in the ca&s;e of a &s;hip ta|ken <HI>at &s;ea,</HI> he inclines to think that this <HI>&s;pes recuperandi</HI> &s;hould be held to continue till the ve&s;&s;el be once brought into &s;ome place of &s;afety, without di&s;tingui&s;hing whether &s;he was a longer or &s;horter &s;pace in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the captor.</P>
<P>But however much tho&s;e ingenious and &s;peculative authors may have differed upon this general point, in this they all agree, that it is in the power of every particular &s;tate to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch regula|tions with regard to this matter, as &s;hall appear to be mo&s;t pro|per and be&s;t adapted to promote the intere&s;t of that &s;tate. Ac|cordingly, in almo&s;t all the maritim nations in Europe, this point has been fixed by &s;ome particular enactment or regulation. In Scot|land, it does not appear that ever any &s;tatute was pa&s;&s;ed with regard to this point; but it appears, that at a very early period the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ve&s;&s;el taken as prize, for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, was held &s;ufficient to ve&s;t the property in the captor. This plainly ap|pears from the following pa&s;&s;age in Balfour's practicks, where, treating of an &s;hip taken by enemies, and recovered by ane friend, it is &s;aid, <Q>giff it happens ony &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el to be taken be the enemies, and thereafter, within the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, to be recour&s;it and taken again be any of our Sovereign Lord's leiges, the &s;aid &s;hip, with all the guides and geir contenit in her, aucht and &s;hould be re&s;tored to the owners; but gif the &s;aid &s;hip was in the enemies hands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be the &s;pace of twenty-fours, and thereafter is recovered by any &s;ub|ject or friend, the &s;amen is ju&s;t and lawful prize, with all the guides and gair contenit in her, and fall pertain to him quha recoverit her out of the enemies handes.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;imilar regulation was e&s;tabli&s;hed in France by the following ordinance of Lewis XIV. <Q>Si aucune navire de nos &s;ujets e&s;t repri&s;e &s;ur nos ennemies, apr&egrave;s qu'il aura demueur&eacute; entre leurs mains pendant vingt-quatre heures, la pri&s;e en &s;era bonne. Et &s;i elle e&s;t faite avant les vingt-quatre heures, il &s;era re&s;titu&egrave; au proprietaire avec tout ce qui e&s;toit dedans, &agrave; la re&s;erve du tiers, qui &s;era donn&eacute; au navire qui aura fait la recour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">In England, for more than a century pa&s;t, this matter has been regulated by &s;pecial &s;tatute. In the beginning of every war it has been cu&s;tomary to pa&s;s an act, commonly called the prize-act, for determining all que&s;tions as to the legality of prizes, and particularly for a&s;certaining, in the ca&s;e of a recapture, the rights and intere&s;ts of the original owner and of the recap|tor. Thus, by the 5th of William and Mary, it is provi|ded, <Q>That if any &s;hip, ve&s;&s;el, or boat, taken as prize, or any goods therein, &s;hall appear and be proved in the court of admiralty, to be belonging to any of their Maje&s;ties &s;ubjects of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or any of the dominions and territories thereunto belonging, remaining and continuing under their Maje&s;ties protection and obedience, which were be|fore taken or &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ubjects of the French King, or any of their Maje&s;ties enemies, and afterwards again &s;urpri&s;ed and retaken by any of their Maje&s;ties &s;hips of war, or any private man of war, or other &s;hip, ve&s;&s;el, or boat, under their Maje&s;ties protection or obedience; that then &s;uch &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, boats, and goods, and every &s;uch part and parts thereof as a|fore&s;aid, belonging to &s;uch their Maje&s;ties &s;ubjects, &s;hall be adjudged to be re&s;tored, and &s;hall be by decree of the &s;aid court of admiralty accordingly re&s;tored to &s;uch former owner or owners, or proprietors, he or they paying for, and in lieu of, &s;alvage, if taken by one of their Maje&s;ties &s;hips of war, an eighth part of the true value of the &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, boats, and goods re&s;pectively &s;o to be re&s;tored; which &s;alvage &s;hall be an|&s;wered and paid to the captains, officers, and &s;eamen, in the &s;aid man of war, to be divided in &s;uch manner as before in this act is directed touching the &s;hare of prizes belonging to the captains, officers, and &s;eamen, where prizes are taken by any of their Maje&s;ties &s;hips of war; and if taken by a privateer, or other &s;hip, ve&s;&s;el, or boat, after having been in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the enemy twenty-four hours, an eighth part of the true value of the &s;aid &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, boats, and goods; and if a|bove twenty-four hours, and under forty-eight, a fifth part thereof; and if above forty-eight hours, and under ninety-&s;ix, a third part thereof; and if above ninety-&s;ix hours, a moiety thereof: all which payments to be made to any pri|vateer, or other &s;hip, ve&s;&s;el, or boat, &s;hall be without any de|ductions: And if &s;uch &s;hip &s;o retaken &s;hall appear to have been,
<PB N="9" REF="9">after the taking by the enemy, by them &s;et forth as a man of war, the former owners and proprietors, to whom the &s;ame &s;hall be re&s;tored, &s;hall be adjudged to pay, and &s;hall pay, for &s;al|vage, the full moiety of the true value of the &s;aid &s;hip &s;o taken and re&s;tored, without deduction, as afore&s;aid, any law, cu&s;tom, or u&s;age, to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>Acts containing &s;imilar regulations have &s;ince been repeatedly pa&s;&s;ed by the parliament of Great Britain, upon occa&s;ion of the different wars in which this nation has &s;ince been engaged.</P>
<P>Such being the rules adopted by different &s;tates, the &s;u&s;pender, were the que&s;tion to turn upon that point, would maintain with confidence, that the charger is mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that, <HI>till con|demnation,</HI> the property remains in the original owner, and till then is not transferred to the captor. Even Bynkershoeck does not carry the matter that length; and, &s;o far as the &s;u&s;pender can learn, no nation in Europe now follows that rule. It is indeed true, that it appears that anciently, before the matter was regu|lated by act of parliament, the court of admiralty in England, in &s;ome in&s;tances, held, that the property was not changed till con|demnation. The charger has quoted a very re&s;pectable autho|rity to &s;how that &s;uch was the <HI>ancient</HI> practice in the court of ad|miralty in England. But it is obvious, that this ancient practice cannot in any &s;hape &s;upport the plea of the charger. For a cen|tury pa&s;t, the matter has been regulated by &s;pecial acts of par|liament, and put upon a footing altogether different. If therefore the ancient practice were at all to be attended to, it is the law and the practice of Scotland, not that of England, which your Lord|&s;hips would think your&s;elves bound to regard. The &s;u&s;pender has &s;hown, that in Scotland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a prize for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours was &s;ufficient to ve&s;t the property in the cap|tor, to the exclu&s;ion of the original owner, in the ca&s;e of a recap|ture. But in truth, now that the matter is regulated by Briti&s;h &s;tatutes, they mu&s;t have effect in every ca&s;e to which they apply, without regard to what was the ancient practice, either in Eng|land or in Scotland.</P>
<P>The form of condemning prizes in courts of admiralty has been adopted in almo&s;t every nation in Europe, and has been introdu|ced for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;alutary purpo&s;es, to prevent neutral &s;hips from being &s;eized as prizes, and detained as &s;uch. To pre|vent this, it has been made a general rule, That every prize, whe|ther
<PB N="10" REF="10">taken by a &s;hip of war or by a privateer, &s;hall be tried in a court of admiralty, where the owner has an opportunity of &s;how|ing that the ve&s;&s;el is not a lawful prize, becau&s;e &s;he does not be|long to the enemy, but to a neutral or a friendly &s;tate. This is the only purpo&s;e of condemnation; and it has no effect whatever upon the rights of parties, where the ve&s;&s;el truly belonged to the enemy. That in the ca&s;e of a recapture the circum&s;tance of the prize being condemned or not condemned has no effect upon the right of the original owner, is plain to demon&s;tration; and, with|out going further, mu&s;t be evident from attending to the practice of Great Britain and of France. By the prize-act, the original owner, in the ca&s;e of recapture, is intitled to get back his &s;hip up|on paying the &s;alvage, without any di&s;tinction, or without any inquiry whether &s;he has been condemned or not. In <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, the Briti&s;h owner is intitled to have his &s;hip re&s;tored, if &s;he be retaken at any time during the war. If the ve&s;&s;el be carried into France, condemned there in a court of admiralty, then &s;old to a French merchant, and then &s;ail, and be re-retaken, the Briti&s;h owner is intitled to recover his ve&s;&s;el, upon paying the &s;tated &s;alvage, in the &s;ame manner that he would be intitled to recover her, had &s;he been retaken <HI>before</HI> condemnation, or even before &s;he was car|ried into the French port.</P>
<P>In like manner, it has been &s;hown, that by an ordinance of the King of France, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a French &s;hip, taken by an ene|my for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, transfers the property, &s;o as to exclude the original owner altogether in the ca&s;e of a recap|ture; and yet by the laws of France condemnation of prizes in a court of admiralty is as &s;trictly enjoined as it is in Great Britain. This &s;ufficiently &s;hows that the regulations as to the condemnation of prizes, introduced for the protection of &s;hips belonging to neu|tral or to friendly powers, have no influence whatever, in the ca&s;e of a lawful prize, upon the right and intere&s;t of the original owner in the ca&s;e of a recapture.</P>
<P>In judging therefore of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion upon the principles of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, it &s;eems to be evident, that where a Briti&s;h &s;hip is taken by an enemy, nothing more remains with the owner than a right to retake her, or a chance of her being reta|ken, in which ca&s;e the recaptor is obliged to re&s;tore her to the o|riginal owner, upon payment of the &s;alvage fixed by act of par|liament.
<PB N="11" REF="11">But if the ve&s;&s;el be never retaken, if &s;he remain in the hands of the enemy till a peace, it is of no con&s;equence to the Briti&s;h owner whether the ve&s;&s;el was condemned in France or not. Suppo&s;ing the French captor had neglected that form, that cir|cum&s;tance would not intitle the Briti&s;h owner, upon the conclu|&s;ion of the war, to in&s;i&s;t that the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be re&s;tored to him, becau&s;e &s;he had not been condemned in a court of admiralty. The plain an&s;wer to that demand would be, that although the French captor had acted irregularly, and had di&s;regarded the laws of his own country, in not bringing his prize before the court of ad|miralty; yet that circum&s;tance could never intitle the Briti&s;h owner to in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution of the ve&s;&s;el, which, from his own &s;tatement of the ca&s;e, from the terms of his own claim, plainly appeared to be a lawful prize.</P>
<P>This leads the &s;u&s;pender to ob&s;erve, that the charger has fallen into a mi&s;take in &s;uppo&s;ing that every irregularity upon the part of the captor is to have an effect upon the right of the original owner, and to intitle him to in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution, becau&s;e every form may not have been &s;trictly complied with upon the part of the captor. There are many ca&s;es in which the captor will have no right to the prize, and yet the original owner will have no title to in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution. For example, no &s;hip be|longing to any private individual is intitled to &s;eize the ve&s;&s;els, even of a declared enemy, unle&s;s authori&s;ed to do &s;o by letters of marque i&s;&s;ued for that purpo&s;e. Accordingly, if a Briti&s;h &s;hip, during a war with France, &s;eize and bring into port a French ve&s;&s;el, the captor, if not furni&s;hed with letters of marque, can|not appropriate the prize to him&s;elf, and has no claim to any &s;hare of it: but the owners of the French ve&s;&s;el have no right to in&s;i&s;t, that &s;he &s;hall be re&s;tored to them, upon this footing, that &s;he was <HI>illegally</HI> &s;eized. The French owners could not avail them&s;elves of that circum&s;tance, and the ve&s;&s;el would be con&s;idered as a droit of admiralty, and as &s;uch would be detained.</P>
<P>In like manner, were a Briti&s;h privateer furni&s;hed with letters of marque again&s;t France only, to take a Spani&s;h prize, the own|ers of the privateer would have no right to that prize: but, on the other hand, the original owners would have no title to in&s;i&s;t, that it &s;hould be re&s;tored to them, becau&s;e it had been &s;eized with|out authority; and becau&s;e the commander of the Briti&s;h priva|teer had acted illegally in making the &s;eizure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">Many other ca&s;es of the &s;ame kind may be figured; but the &s;u&s;pender &s;hall &s;atisfy him&s;elf with mentioning one other ca&s;e. With us, in the ca&s;e of prizes, whether taken by &s;hips of war or by privateers, it is required, that every prize &s;hall be condemned in the court of admiralty before &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed of. The rea&s;on of this regulation has already been explained. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that, with|out attending to this regulation, the captain of a man of war, or of a privateer, &s;hould adverti&s;e a prize for &s;ale, and actually &s;ell her without u&s;ing the form of a condemnation; in that ca&s;e, he no doubt does an illegal and an unwarrantable thing, and the pur|cha&s;er runs a manife&s;t ri&s;k; for notwith&s;tanding that &s;ale, it mu&s;t at any time be competent to the owners of the prize to &s;how, that &s;he was not a lawful prize; that &s;he did not belong to the &s;ubjects of France, or of any other power at war with Great Britain; but that in truth &s;he was the property of the &s;ubjects of a neutral or of a friendly power. In that ca&s;e, there is not a doubt that the owners would at any time be intitled to reclaim the ve&s;&s;el; and that the purcha&s;e, though made <HI>bona fide,</HI> could not warrant the purcha&s;er to with-hold her from them. But, on the other hand, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition that the ve&s;&s;el, did in truth belong to the enemy, and was in fact a lawful prize: it is not obvious, upon what principle of &s;ound &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on the original owners could reclaim her, merely becau&s;e the form of trying her in a court of admiralty had not been complied with. The very terms of their claim mu&s;t &s;how that the prize was a lawful prize, and therefore they could not in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution in this &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, any more than they could do in the ca&s;e of a prize taken by a privateer not provided with letters of marque, or in any other ca&s;e where the forms in|troduced for the protection of neutral ve&s;&s;els had not been com|plied with.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this farther, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that a French privateer takes a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, carries her into port, and there &s;ells her to the &s;ubject of a neutral &s;tate, a Ru&s;&s;ian, or a Swede, for in&s;tance. After making the purcha&s;e, and paying the price, the neutral pur|cha&s;er &s;ails to a Briti&s;h port, con&s;idering the ve&s;&s;el as his undoubt|ed property; could it, in that ca&s;e, be maintained, that the Bri|ti&s;h owner is intitled to &s;eize that ve&s;&s;el, and to claim her as his property, becau&s;e the purcha&s;er could not &s;how that &s;he had been tried and condemned in a court of admiralty in France? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it would be an undoubted good an&s;wer, upon the part of
<PB N="13" REF="13">the purcha&s;er, that the very facts on which the original owner founded his claim &s;howed to demon&s;tration that he had no title to in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution of a prize lawfully made by an enemy with whom he was at open war; and that, &s;o far as he was concern|ed, it was altogether immaterial whether the forms of a trial and condemnation in a court of admiralty had been complied with or not.</P>
<P>In a word then, there cannot be a doubt that the purcha&s;e of a <HI>lawful prize,</HI> though made before condemnation, mu&s;t &s;tand good, and no law has &s;aid that the want of condemnation can ever have the effect to intitle the original owner to evict the ve&s;&s;el from the purcha&s;er, merely becau&s;e that form had been omitted. A per&s;on purcha&s;ing before condemnation, runs a certain degree of ri&s;k. He runs the hazard of the ve&s;&s;el proving to be neutral, in which ca&s;e &s;he may be claimed by the owner. That is the only ri&s;k which a per&s;on who purcha&s;es, even before condemnation, runs.</P>
<P>After all that has been &s;aid, however, the pre&s;ent ca&s;e does not &s;eem to turn upon the general que&s;tion, when the property of a prize is &s;uppo&s;ed to ve&s;t in the captor, or what is to be the effect of a recapture, &s;o far as concerns the intere&s;t of the original owner, and of the recaptor? Had the &s;u&s;pender recaptured this ve&s;&s;el, there could not have been room for a moment's doubt in the ca&s;e. By &s;pecial act of parliament, by the terms of the prize-act, the charger would have been intitled to in&s;i&s;t for re&s;titution of the ve&s;&s;el, upon payment of the &s;alvage fixed and a&s;certained by that &s;tatute. But here there is no recapture, and the &s;tatute does not apply. It is a &s;pecial ca&s;e, which mu&s;t be judged of upon its own circum|&s;tances, which are extremely peculiar. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances have already been explained, and &s;hall not now be repeated. The &s;u&s;|pender &s;ubmits, that under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, the tran&s;action he entered into with the commander of the French privateer, was a fair, a proper, and a rational tran&s;|action, prohibited by no principle of material ju&s;tice, nor by any po&s;itive law which the &s;u&s;pender knows of. In entering into the tran&s;action, the &s;u&s;pender did not conceive that he was doing an injury to any human being, and he did not under&s;tand that he was counteracting the laws of his country in any particu|lar. If the &s;u&s;pender had not made the purcha&s;e, the ve&s;&s;el would have been in&s;tantly &s;unk. It is a certain fact that the French com|mander had formed that re&s;olution, and was preparing to put it
<PB N="14" REF="14">in execution, when this agreement was entered into; and had it not been for that circum&s;tance, would infallibly have carried his intentions into execution. That he had it in his power to do &s;o, can|not be di&s;puted; and that he might have done it with propriety, is equally clear. In the &s;ituation in which he &s;tood, he had no alterna|tive but to fink the ve&s;&s;el, or to return into port with her; for the charger him&s;elf admits, that the commander of the French privateer had weakened him&s;elf &s;o much, by &s;ending the &s;u&s;pender's ve&s;&s;el into port, that he could not with any &s;afety to him&s;elf &s;pare a &s;ufficient number of hands to carry the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion into port.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;uppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of &s;elling the ve&s;&s;el to the &s;u&s;|pender, Captain Magray had actually &s;unk her, agreeably to his original intentions, could the charger in that ca&s;e have had any claim again&s;t the Captain, or the owners of the French privateer, for damages? The &s;u&s;pender believes, that the charger will not &s;eriou&s;ly pretend to maintain, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e he could have followed Captain Magray to France, and complained that he had acted illegally in &s;inking the ve&s;&s;el. He might, with rea&s;on, have &s;aid, that in the circum&s;tances in which he &s;tood, he could not act otherwi&s;e with any propriety. He would have been in|titled to &s;ay to the charger, Mr Palmer, <Q>how are you injured, or what right have you, a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, to complain of my conduct? Were you the &s;ubject of a neutral power, and could you &s;how that I had wilfully &s;unk your ve&s;&s;el, knowing her to be a neutral &s;hip, you might have rea&s;on to complain of my conduct, and to demand damages from me. But that not being the ca&s;e, as your ve&s;&s;el was a lawful prize, what earthly rea&s;on can you have to complain of me for di&s;po&s;ing of that prize in the way which, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, to me appeared to be the mo&s;t pro|per and advantageous to my&s;elf, to my employers, and to my country.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender maintains, That upon the plain principles of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, the French captain would have been intitled to hold this language, and could not have been &s;ubjected in da|mages to the charger, had he actually &s;unk the ve&s;&s;el, as he once intended to have done, and as every body knows, is often done in &s;uch ca&s;es. But if this be once admitted, it mu&s;t &s;eem extra|ordinary to maintain, that he could not &s;ell a ve&s;&s;el which he might with impunity have &s;unk or de&s;troyed. So far as the in|tere&s;t of the charger may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be concerned, it was cer|tainly
<PB N="15" REF="15">the &s;ame whether the &s;hip was &s;unk or &s;old to the &s;u&s;pend|er. The charger &s;uffered equally in both ca&s;es, and can have no more rea&s;on to complain in the one than in the other.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that in place of &s;elling the ve&s;&s;el to the &s;u&s;|pender, the French captor had happened to meet at &s;ea with a ve&s;&s;el belonging to &s;ome neutral power, a Ru&s;&s;ian for example, and had &s;aid to the commander of the Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;el, here is a prize I have taken, which the crew have abandoned, I find &s;he is an incumbrance to me, and I am going to &s;ink her; but if you will pay me &s;ome con&s;ideration for her, you may have her. If the Ru&s;&s;ian had agreed to this propo&s;al, had paid the price, received the ve&s;&s;el, and afterwards, at the di|&s;tance perhaps of years, &s;ent her upon a voyage to Great Britain, the &s;u&s;pender de&s;ires to know, if, in that ca&s;e, there be any prin|ciple of ju&s;tice or of rea&s;on on which the courts of admiralty of Great Britain could proceed to &s;eize this ve&s;&s;el, to take her from the foreigner, who had purcha&s;ed her fairly, and ordain her to be delivered up to the chargers? The &s;u&s;pender humbly apprehends, that no court of admiralty could pronounce &s;uch a decree. Upon the part of the foreign purcha&s;er, it would be a good an&s;wer to the charger's claim to &s;ay, that the very terms of that claim plainly &s;howed, that the ve&s;&s;el was a <HI>lawful prize,</HI> that &s;he was lawfully taken by the enemy, and therefore that he had no rea&s;on to complain, and indeed no intere&s;t to inquire in what manner the ve&s;&s;el was afterwards di&s;po&s;ed of; and that to him it was im|material whether &s;he was &s;unk or blown up, or &s;old to a purcha|&s;er.</P>
<P>If, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the charger could &s;ay that the ve&s;&s;el was not lawfully &s;eized; that &s;he did not belong to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, but to a &s;ubject of Denmark, or of Ru&s;&s;ia, or of &s;ome other neu|tral power, then there might be rea&s;on to &s;ay that the purcha&s;e made by the &s;u&s;pender could not give him a right to the ve&s;&s;el, to the ex|clu&s;ion of the <HI>neutral</HI> owner, the &s;ubject of a power who had no concern in the war, and who&s;e ve&s;&s;el therefore was not liable to be &s;eized. But what is the ca&s;e here, or what is it that intitles Mr Palmer of Yarmouth, in the county of Norfolk, to complain that he has &s;uffered any inju&s;tice, or &s;u&s;tained any injury? Will he pretend to &s;ay that his &s;hip was not lawfully &s;eized? Will he pre|tend to maintain, that he is intitled to take her from the &s;u&s;pend|er, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;inking her, the French captor &s;old her to the &s;u&s;pender, at a ju&s;t and equal price?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">The charger has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion was not a lawful &s;ubject of commerce, becau&s;e, during a &s;tate of war, commerce is not under&s;tood to take place between the &s;ub|jects of the ho&s;tile nations; and therefore that every purcha&s;e, and every contract, entered into in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is illegal and void.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender, however, mu&s;t be pardoned to di&s;pute the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of this general propo&s;ition. That war is an ob&s;truction to commerce, no man can deny; but that it renders void in all cir|cum&s;tances, and in all ca&s;es, every tran&s;action between the &s;ub|jects of the ho&s;tile &s;tates, the &s;u&s;pender cannot admit. Every body knows, that according to the pre&s;ent practice, commerce is carried on to a certain degree, and in a certain manner, even be|tween nations engaged in an open war. Of this many ex|amples, and many in&s;tances, might be given. If the &s;u&s;pender, upon the capture of his own ve&s;&s;el, had &s;ent a power of attorney, authori&s;ing any per&s;on in France to purcha&s;e for his behoof, either the ve&s;&s;el it&s;elf, or any part of the cargo, when expo&s;ed to &s;ale, he cannot believe that there would have been any thing unlawful, any thing improper, in that tran&s;action; and if the ve&s;&s;el had been &s;ent home, or the cargo purcha&s;ed for his behoof had been &s;hipped on board a neutral ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ent home to any port in Great Britain, the &s;u&s;pender knows of no law by which he could have been prevented from availing him&s;elf of that tran&s;action: as he might have ran&s;omed her at &s;ea when taken, &s;o he might have purcha&s;ed her after &s;he was carried into port.</P>
<P>In like manner, if the &s;u&s;pender had been carried into the port of Dunkirk, if his &s;hip and cargo had been condemned there, and there expo&s;ed to &s;ale, he knows of no law which could have prevented him from appearing as an offerer at that &s;ale, and purcha&s;ing either the &s;hip or the cargo.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o, if a &s;ubject of Great Britain had happened to be at Dunkirk at the time of the &s;ale, he would have been at full li|berty to have purcha&s;ed either the &s;hip, or any part of the cargo, and might either have &s;ent them home to Britain, or &s;old them again, as he thought mo&s;t for his own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender &s;hall put another ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion at &s;ea, in the manner he did, the ve&s;&s;el had been carried into a French port, tried there, regu|larly condemned, and then expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and that at that &s;ale the &s;u&s;pender had been the highe&s;t offerer, and either remained there till the conclu&s;ion of the war, or obtained the relea&s;e of him|&s;elf
<PB N="17" REF="17">and his crew, and then returned to Great Britain in the ve&s;&s;el he had thus purcha&s;ed. In either of tho&s;e ca&s;es the &s;u&s;pender &s;ubmits, without any argument, that there is no principle of ju|&s;tice, and no law which he knows of, on which the contract could have been challenged. The charger admits, that if the purcha&s;e had been made by the &s;ubject of a neutral &s;tate, it would have been effectual, and mu&s;t for ever have excluded his claim. But the &s;u&s;pender owns, that he cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on for the di&s;tinction, or any &s;olid principle on which it can be maintained, that a Briti&s;h &s;ubject may not lawfully enter into tran&s;actions of this nature. The argument maintained upon the part of the charger, if there be any thing at all in it, mu&s;t go farther than he has thought it prudent to pu&s;h it. He admits, that the &s;ub|ject of a neutral &s;tate may lawfully purcha&s;e prize-goods, but not the &s;ubjects of that &s;tate from which they are taken. But unle&s;s he go a little farther, the rule for which he contends could have no force or effect whatever. For example, were a cargo of Briti&s;h prize-goods expo&s;ed to &s;ale at Dunkirk or Bourdeaux, the charger admits that they might be lawfully purcha&s;ed by the &s;ubject of a neutral power, &s;o as to exclude the claim of the ori|ginal owner. Suppo&s;ing then they were purcha&s;ed by a neutral merchant, he might, the next hour, or the next day, &s;ell them a|gain upon the &s;pot to a Briti&s;h merchant. The charger has not &s;aid that this tran&s;action could be voided as illegal; but unle&s;s he could maintain the illegality of it, the di&s;tinction for which he contends would be attended with no effect, becau&s;e the Briti&s;h merchant, if prohibited to purcha&s;e directly, might do it at &s;e|cond hand, by the intervention of a neutral per&s;on.</P>
<P>But it is needle&s;s to detain your Lord&s;hips longer upon this point. The di&s;tinction for which the charger contends, &s;eems, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to be founded neither in the &s;ound principles of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, nor on any po&s;itive law which the &s;u&s;|pender knows of.</P>
<P>Without farther argument, therefore, the &s;u&s;pender, upon this branch of the cau&s;e, &s;ubmits, that there is nothing either in the general principles of the public law of nations, or of material ju|&s;tice, on which his claim to the ve&s;&s;el can be &s;et a&s;ide; and that, con&s;idered in either of tho&s;e views, his plea mu&s;t appear well founded. It only now remains to inquire, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, How far the pre&s;ent ca&s;e falls under the &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="18">&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, prohibiting the ran&s;oming of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els taken by the enemy.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of that &s;tatute is well known. It had long been a matter of di&s;pute among&s;t &s;peculative men, whether the practice of ran&s;oming ve&s;&s;els taken by the enemy was beneficial or preju|dicial to the commerce of this country. On the one hand, it was maintained, that by the practice of ran&s;oming, the merchants of this country were gainers, becau&s;e it enabled them, upon paying a &s;um, in general much under the value of the &s;hip and cargo, to carry on their commerce to advantage, and to fulfil the en|gagements they had come under to furni&s;h goods at a certain time and place. On the other hand, it was maintained, that by the practice of ran&s;oming the enemy were enabled to take many more prizes, a circum&s;tance which overbalanced all the advantages ari|&s;ing from the practice. In all our former wars, the arguments in favour of ran&s;oming prevailed. The practice was encouraged, and effect was uniformly given to the ran&s;oming contracts. The &s;ame practice prevailed during the whole cour&s;e of this la&s;t tedious war, till 1782, when the &s;ubject became matter of deliberate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in parliament, and when the arguments again&s;t ran&s;oming ap|peared to be be&s;t founded; and accordingly the act now in que|&s;tion was pa&s;&s;ed, which proceeds upon a narrative, <Q>That the practice of ran&s;oming is found by experience to be liable to great abu&s;es, and there is rea&s;on to apprehend that, upon the whole, it operates more to the di&s;advantage than for the benefit of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</Q></P>
<P>To remedy this evil, it is provided, <Q>That from and after the 1&s;t June 1782 it &s;hall not be lawful for any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to ran&s;om, or enter into any contract or agreement for ran&s;oming, any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el belonging to any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, or any merchandi&s;e or goods on board the &s;ame, which &s;hall be captured by the &s;ubjects of any &s;tate at war with his Maje&s;ty, or by any power committing ho&s;tilities again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</Q></P>
<P>The more effectually to prevent this practice, it is further en|acted, <Q>That all contracts and agreements which &s;hall be entered into, and all bills, notes, and other &s;ecurities, which &s;hall be given by any per&s;on or per&s;ons for ran&s;om of any &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or of any merchandi&s;e or goods on board the &s;ame, con|trary
<PB N="19" REF="19">to this act, &s;hall be ab&s;olutely void in law, and of no ef|fect whatever.</Q></P>
<P>It is further enacted, <Q>That if any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hall, after the &s;aid 1&s;t day of June 1782, ran&s;om, or enter into any con|tract or agreement for ran&s;oming, any &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or any merchandi&s;e or goods on board the &s;ame, every per&s;on &s;o offending &s;hall, for every &s;uch offence, forfeit and lo&s;e the &s;um of L. 500, to be recovered, with full co&s;ts of &s;uit, by any per|&s;on or per&s;ons who &s;hall &s;ue for the &s;ame, by action of debt, in any of his Maje&s;ty's courts of record at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which action no e&s;&s;oin, protection, imparlance, or wager of law &s;hall be allowed.</Q></P>
<P>Such being the terms of the &s;tatute, it is plain that it extends no farther than voiding all ran&s;oming contracts or agreements entered into &s;ub&s;equent to the 1&s;t June 1782, and impo&s;ing a pe|nalty of L. 500 Sterling on every per&s;on who &s;hall enter into any &s;uch contract. It &s;tatutes nothing with regard to the property of the ran&s;omed ve&s;&s;el or goods; and therefore although the charger could &s;how that the &s;u&s;pender had acted in open violation of this &s;tatute, it could not aid his plea in the &s;malle&s;t degree. The only con&s;equence of the &s;uppo&s;ed violation of the &s;tatute would be, to found the &s;u&s;pender in a defence again&s;t Captain Magray, when pur&s;uing for implement of the contract; and it might farther &s;ub|ject the &s;u&s;pender to the penalty of L. 500 Sterling. This is the only effect the &s;tatute could have, allowing that the pre&s;ent ca&s;e fell under it; and that it was in force when the contract now in que&s;tion was entered into.</P>
<P>This leads the &s;u&s;pender to ob&s;erve, that, in point of fact, the &s;tatute was not in force when the contract now in que&s;tion was entered into upon the 25th July 1782. It is indeed true, that the act declares, that from and after the 1&s;t June 1782 it &s;hall not be lawful for any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to ran&s;om, &amp;c. But then it is equally true, that the act contains a clau&s;e of limitation, by which it is provided, <Q>That nothing herein contained &s;hall extend, or be con&s;trued to extend, to make void any contract or agreement which &s;hall be entered into, or any bill, note, or other &s;ecurity, which &s;hall be given by any ma&s;ter of a cap|tured &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or by any other per&s;on or per&s;ons on board, or belonging to the &s;ame, for ran&s;om thereof, or of any mer|chandi&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="20">or goods on board &s;aid &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or to inflict any penalty upon any ma&s;ter of any captured &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or any other per&s;on or per&s;ons on board belonging to the &s;ame, for ran&s;oming or entering into any contract or agreement for ran|&s;oming &s;uch &s;hip, or ve&s;&s;el, or merchandi&s;es, or goods on board the &s;ame, until after the expiration of two months after the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, for any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el &s;ailing from any foreign European port, or until after the expiration of four months from the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, for any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el &s;ail|ing from any foreign port out of Europe.</Q></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent ca&s;e falls directly under this clau&s;e. The &s;u&s;pender &s;ailed from the frith of Forth, in May 1782, to Gottenburg, be|fore this act had pa&s;&s;ed. He took in his cargo there; and on his return was taken on the 10th of July; and on the 25th of July, within the two months from the 1&s;t of June, entered into the contract now in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The charger has attempted to maintain, that the clau&s;e of limi|tation does not apply to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, becau&s;e his ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from a Briti&s;h and not from a foreign port. But this circum|&s;tance &s;eems to be of little moment. The cau&s;e of the limitation in the act was the evident hard&s;hip of &s;ubjecting per&s;ons to high penalties, who were ignorant of the regulations introduced by the act, and who thought they were doing a proper and a legal thing, which had been encouraged by all former laws, as beneficial to the trade and to the commerce of this country. In judging there|fore of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, your Lord&s;hips will take into your con&s;ideration the &s;ituation of the &s;u&s;pender, who entered into the contract, and will not inquire whether the hulk of the ve&s;&s;el, which was the &s;ubject of that contract, &s;ailed from a Briti&s;h or from a foreign port.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the French privateer had taken the ve&s;&s;el now in que|&s;tion before he had &s;ent the &s;u&s;pender's ve&s;&s;el into port, it mu&s;t be admitted, that it would have been lawful in the &s;u&s;pender to ran&s;om his own ve&s;&s;el, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;ailed from a foreign port; and therefore, under the authority of the clau&s;e of limitation in the act of parliament, he was intitled to ran&s;om her. In that &s;i|tuation, might not the commander of the French privateer have &s;aid, with great propriety, to the &s;u&s;pender, there is a cargo on board your ve&s;&s;el, which I wi&s;h to carry into France, and there|fore I will not ran&s;om her; but here is another prize, in which
<PB N="21" REF="21">there is no cargo, and which the crew have abandoned, I will therefore allow you to purcha&s;e her, if you incline to do &s;o. The &s;u&s;pender &s;ubmits, without any argument, that there is nothing in the act of parliament founded on by the charger to have prevented the &s;u&s;pender in the ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, to take this prize which the crew had abandoned, in&s;tead of his own ve&s;&s;el, which the captor wi&s;hed rather to detain. To all this it may be added, that, in no view of the ca&s;e, the &s;tatute can affect the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, be|cau&s;e the object of it certainly was to prevent the ma&s;ters and own|ers of ve&s;&s;els captured from <HI>ran&s;oming</HI> their own &s;hips; and not to prevent third parties from afterwards <HI>purcha&s;ing</HI> &s;uch ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender has detained your Lord&s;hips longer than perhaps was nece&s;&s;ary on this branch of the cau&s;e. He was led to do &s;o from this circum&s;tance, that from the proceedings in the court of admiralty, it appears that this &s;tatute was the chief ground on which judgement was given in that court in favour of the char|ger. But now that the terms of the &s;tatute have been explained, the &s;u&s;pender is advi&s;ed, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, upon any &s;olid prin|ciple, to maintain that it can have any influenee whatever in the deci&s;ion of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The charger has been at &s;ome pains to &s;how, that &s;uppo&s;ing his claim to the property of the &s;hip to be &s;u&s;tained, he would not be liable to defray either the expence incurred by the &s;u&s;pender, in repairing her, or to relieve the &s;u&s;pender from the obligation he came under to the commander of the French privateer.</P>
<P>Upon this point the &s;u&s;pender does not propo&s;e at pre&s;ent to trouble your Lord&s;hips with any argument. He declines doing it, for two rea&s;ons, 1&s;t, Becau&s;e he hopes he has &s;hown, to the full con|viction of your Lord&s;hips, that he has an undoubted right to the property of the ve&s;&s;el; 2d, That &s;hould the rever&s;e be found, he holds it to be &s;o clear that he is intitled to be indemnified, that it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble your Lord&s;hips with any ar|gument upon the point. Had it not been for the tran&s;action en|tered into between the &s;u&s;pender and the commander of the French privateer, the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion would in&s;tantly have been &s;unk. If therefore &s;he be now to be re&s;tored to the charger, he is by every principle of ju&s;tice bound to relieve the &s;u&s;pender of the con&s;equences of that tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Upon this head it may be proper to mention, that at the time when the charger arre&s;ted the ve&s;&s;el, the &s;u&s;pender was rai&s;ing
<PB N="22" REF="22">money, and taking the proper &s;teps to pay the &s;tipulated price, in order to relieve Ma&s;terton the ho&s;tage. He was advi&s;ed, however, upon the charger's entering his claim, to proceed no farther till the point of right as to the property of the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be de|cided, becau&s;e if the charger prevailed, it would then be incum|bent on him to fulfil the obligation the &s;u&s;pender had come un|der. In the mean time, an action was commenced in the court of admiralty, at the in&s;tance of Ma&s;terton, in which he concluded, That the &s;u&s;pender <Q>&s;hould be decerned and ordained, by &s;en|tence and decreet of the judge of our &s;aid high court of admi|ralty, in&s;tantly to make payment to the complainer James Ma|&s;terton, as attorney for, or having power from the complainer Peter Ma&s;terton, the fore&s;aid &s;um of 150 guineas Sterling, with the intere&s;t that may be due thereon, to the end that the &s;aid Peter Ma&s;terton may be thereby relieved from his impri&s;onment as a ho&s;tage.</Q></P>
<P>The charger has been plea&s;ed to in&s;inuate, that this action was brought by &s;ome collu&s;ion between Ma&s;terton and the &s;u&s;pender. But it is difficult to di&s;cover how this action could afford any aid to the &s;u&s;pender in the que&s;tion depending between him and the charger. That in fact there was no collu&s;ion, is mo&s;t certain. The action was rai&s;ed by a brother of Ma&s;terton's, in con&s;equence of a letter from him, dated, Dunkirk pri&s;on, 22d Augu&s;t 1782, before the charger had entered his claim to this ve&s;&s;el, and when there was no pro&s;pect that the pre&s;ent que&s;tion would ever have ari&s;en. That letter was produced by Ma&s;terton's brother, as his authority for carrying on the action again&s;t the &s;u&s;pender.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender, in the action at Ma&s;terton's in&s;tance again&s;t him, gave in defences, in which he acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of the pur&s;uer's title to in&s;i&s;t, that the obligation the &s;u&s;pender had come under to the commander of the French privateer &s;hould be implemented, in order that the pur&s;uer Ma&s;terton might obtain his liberation. But while the &s;u&s;pender acknowledged this in the mo&s;t explicit terms, and admitted, that the terms of the obliga|tion were as &s;tated by the pur&s;uer, (&s;o far as re&s;pected the price of the ve&s;&s;el), the &s;u&s;pender, in ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, &s;ubmitted, that it would be proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t procedure in the action at the in&s;tance of Ma&s;terton, till the deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion in the ca&s;e of Palmer, becau&s;e upon the event of that que&s;tion it would depend whether
<PB N="23" REF="23">the charger or the &s;u&s;pender would be obliged to fulfil that ob|ligation. The judge, however, of the high court of admiralty &s;aw the matter in a very different light from that in which it had been viewed by the parties, and was, of this date,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 6. 1782.</NOTE> plea&s;ed to pro|nounce the following interlocutor: <Q>Having advi&s;ed proce&s;s, de|fences, an&s;wers, and writs produced, and having con&s;idered that the pur&s;uer Peter Ma&s;terton agreed to become a ho&s;tage po&s;terior to the date of the &s;tatute prohibiting the ran&s;oming of &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els captured from his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, &amp;c. finds, That the pre&s;ent action, at his in&s;tance, cannot be &s;u&s;tained; therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;es the &s;ame, and decerns.</Q> To this interlo|cutor the judge afterwards adhered. Whether Ma&s;terton will be advi&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in this judgement, or whether it would ap|pear to your Lord&s;hips to be well founded, if brought under your review, the &s;u&s;pender cannot pretend to &s;ay. If he has given a ju&s;t interpretation of the &s;tatute, the admiral has proceeded upon a mi&s;take, in &s;uppo&s;ing that that &s;tatute applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But be that as it may, if the &s;u&s;pender prevail in the que&s;tion with Mr Palmer, he will never attempt to avail him&s;elf of the judgement of the admiral, a&s;&s;oilzieing him from the action at the in&s;tance of Ma&s;terton. If the &s;u&s;pender prevail in the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion, he mu&s;t con&s;ider him&s;elf as under a moral obliga|tion to relieve Ma&s;terton, by fulfilling his obligation to the commander of the French privateer. <HI>That</HI> the &s;u&s;pender will think him&s;elf bound to do by every rule of ju&s;tice, if he prevail in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. If, on the other hand, the charger &s;hould, contrary to the &s;u&s;pender's expectations, prevail, it would be e|qually incumbent upon him to fulfil that obligation, in con&s;e|quence of which alone his ve&s;&s;el has been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pender &s;hall not detain your Lord&s;hips longer. Upon con&s;idering the whole circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, he humbly hopes you will be of opinion, that his plea is founded upon the plain principles of common ju&s;tice, and that neither by the &s;tatute founded on by the charger, nor by any other law in this country, the tran&s;action now in que&s;tion can be con&s;idered as illegal or im|proper.</P>
