<HEAD>THE LIFE OF HUGH LATIMER, Bi&s;hop of Worcester.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>HUGH LATIMER was born at Thirke&s;&s;on in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, about the year 1470. His father was a yeoman of good reputation; had no land of his own, but rented a &s;mall farm, on which, in tho&s;e frugal times, he maintained a large family, &s;ix daughters, and a &s;on. Mr. Lari|mer, in one of his court &s;ermons in king Edward's time, inveighing again&s;t the op|pre&s;&s;ion then exerci&s;ed in the country by the nobility and gentry, and &s;peaking of the mo|deration
<PB N="2" REF="2">of landlords a few years before, and the plenty in which their tenants lived, tells his audience, in his familiar way, <Q>That upon a farm of four pounds a year at the utmo&s;t, his father tilled as much ground as kept half a dozen men; that he had it &s;tocked with an hundred &s;heep, and thirty cows; that he found the king a man and hor&s;e, him&s;elf remembering to have buckled on his father's harne&s;s, when he went to Black-heath; that he gave his daughters five pounds apiece at marriage; that he lived ho&s;pitably among his neighbours, and was not backward in his alms to the poor.</Q>&mdash;An entertaining picture of an old Engli&s;h yeoman!</P>
<P>We meet with nothing about Mr. Latimer worth relating, till we find him a ma&s;ter of arts, in prie&s;t's orders, at Cambridge. Here his youth had been wholly employed on the divinity of the times. He read the &s;chool|men and the &s;criptures with the &s;ame reve|rence, and held Thomas a Becket and the apo&s;tles in equal honour; in a word, he was a zealous papi&s;t.</P>
<P>Many of the reformed opinions, which were then fermenting in Germany, had by
<PB N="3" REF="3">this time di&s;covered them&s;elves in England. The legi&s;tature had not yet interfered; but the watchful prie&s;ts had taken the alarm, and the danger of the church was already become the popular cry. Mr. Latimer, among others, heard, with high indignation, the&s;e novel teachers: zeal wrought the &s;ame effect in him that intere&s;t did in the many; and while others were apprehen&s;ive that their temporals might be in danger, he was concerned for the &s;ouls of men. The la&s;t times, he thought, were now approaching: impiety was gaining ground apace: what lengths might not men be expected to run, when they began to que|&s;tion even the infallibility of the pope?</P>
<P>As his well-meant zeal was thus inflamed, it of cour&s;e broke out into all the effects of bigotry. He inveighed publicly and privately again&s;t the reformers. If any read lectures in the &s;chools &s;u&s;pected of their tenets, Mr. La|timer was &s;ure to be there to drive out the &s;cholars; and having an opportunity, when he commenced bachelor of divinity, to give an open te&s;timony of his di&s;like to their pro|ceedings, he made an oration again&s;t Me|lancthon, whom he treated with great &s;eve|rity for his impious innovations in religion.
<PB N="4" REF="4">His zeal was &s;o much taken notice of in the univer&s;ity, that he was elected into the office of cro&s;s-bearer in all public proce&s;&s;ions; an employment, which he accepted with reve|rence, and di&s;charged with becoming &s;olem|nity.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e in Cambridge, who at this time favoured the reformation, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was Thomas Bilney. He was a man of a mo&s;t holy life; and having long ob&s;erved the &s;candalous &s;tate of monkery in the nation, and the prevailing debauchery of the clergy, he was led to doubt, whether their principles might not be as corrupt as their practice; and whether the new opinions, then gaining ground, might not be more than plau&s;ible. Time increa&s;ed his &s;u&s;picions. He read Luther's writings, and approved them. He conver&s;ed with prote&s;tants, and found them men of temper and learning. He talked with papi&s;ts, and ob&s;erved a bitterne&s;s and rancour in their &s;tyle, which ill became a good cau&s;s. In few words, he began to &s;ee popery in a very di&s;agreeable light; and made no &s;cruple to own it.</P>
<P>It was Mr. Latimer's good fortune to be well acquainted with this religious per&s;on.
<PB N="5" REF="5">Mr. Bilney had long indeed conceived very fa|vourable &s;entiments of him. He had known his life in the univer&s;ity, a life &s;trictly moral and devout: he a&s;cribed his failings to the genius of his religion; and notwith&s;tanding his more than ordinary zeal in the profe&s;&s;ion of that re|ligion, he could not but ob&s;erve in him a ve|ry candid temper, prejudiced by no fini&s;ter views, and an hone&s;ty of heart, which gave him great hopes of his reformation.</P>
<P>Induced by the&s;e favourable appearances, Mr. Bilney failed not, as opportunities offered, to &s;ugge&s;t many things to him about corrup|tions in religion; and would frequently drop a hint, that in the Romi&s;h church in particular there were perhaps &s;ome things, which rather deviated from apo&s;tolic plainne&s;s. He would in&s;tance &s;ome of it's gro&s;&s;er tenets; and a&s;k, whether the &s;criptural authority alledged for them was wholly &s;ufficient? if not, whether tradition were a &s;afe vehicle for doctrines of &s;uch importance? Thus &s;tarting cavils, and infu&s;ing &s;u&s;picions, he prepared the way for his whole creed, which at length he opened; concluding with an earne&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, that Mr. Latimer would only endeavour to dive&s;t him&s;elf of his prejudices, and place the two
<PB N="6" REF="6">&s;ides of the que&s;tion before him, with an ho|ne&s;t heart for his guide.</P>
<P>How Mr. Latimer at fir&s;t received the&s;e free declarations, and by what &s;teps he attain|ed a &s;ettlement in his religious opinions, I meet with no account; this only I find in gene|ral, that Mr. Bilney's friend&s;hip toward him had its effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer no &s;ooner cea&s;ed from being a zealous papi&s;t, than he became (&s;uch was his con&s;titutional warmth) a zealous prote&s;tant. He had nothing of that neutral coolne&s;s in his temper, which the Athenian lawgiver di&s;cou|raged in a commonwealth. Accordingly we &s;oon find him very active in &s;upporting and propagating the reformed opinions. He en|deavoured with great a&s;&s;iduity to make con|verts, both in the town, and in the univer&s;i|ty; preaching in public, exhorting in private, and every where pre&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ity of a holy life, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e outward per|formances, which were then thought the e&s;&s;entials of religion.</P>
<P>A behaviour of this kind was immediately taken notice of. Cambridge was then the &s;eat of ignorance, bigotry, and &s;uper&s;tition: every new opinion was watched with the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="7">jealou&s;y; and Mr. Latimer &s;oon perceived how obnoxious he had already made him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarkable oppo&s;ition he met with from the popi&s;h party, was occa&s;ioned by a cour&s;e of &s;ermons he preached during the holidays of Chri&s;tmas, before the univer|&s;ity; in which he &s;poke his &s;entiments with great freedom upon many opinions and u&s;ages, maintained and practi&s;ed in the Romi&s;h Church. In the&s;e &s;ermons he &s;hewed the impiety of indulgences, the uncertainty of tradition, and the vanity of works of &s;uper|errogation: he inveighed again&s;t that multi|plicity of ceremonies with which true religion was incumbered; and the pride and u&s;urpa|tion of the Romi&s;h hierarchy: but what he mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon was, that great abu&s;e of locking up the &s;cripture in an unknown tongue; giving his rea&s;ons without any re|&s;erve, why it ought to be put in every one's hands.</P>
<P>Few of the tenets of popery were then que&s;tioned in England, but &s;uch as tended to a relaxation of morals. Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and other points, rather &s;peculative, &s;till held their dominion. Mr. Latimer therefore, chiefly
<PB N="8" REF="8">dwelt upon tho&s;e of immoral tendency. He &s;hewed what true religion was; that it was &s;eated in the heart; and that, in compani&s;on with it, external appointments were of no value.</P>
<P>Great was the outcry occa&s;ioned by the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es. Mr. Latimer was then a preacher of &s;ome eminence, and began to di&s;play a re|markable addre&s;s in adapting him&s;elf to the capacities of the people. The orthodox cler|gy ob&s;erving him thus followed, thought it high time to oppo&s;e him openly. This ta&s;k was undertaken by Dr. Buckenham, prior of the black friers, who appeared in the pulpit a few Sundays after, and with great pomp and prolixity, &s;hewed the dangerous tendency of Mr. Latimer's opinions: particularly he in|veighed again&s;t his heretical notions of having the &s;criptures in Engli&s;h, laying open the ill effects of &s;uch an innovation. If that here|&s;y, &s;aid he, &s;hould prevail, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee an end of every thing u&s;eful among us. The ploughman reading, that if he put his hand to the plough, and &s;hould happen to look back, he was unfit for the kingdom of God, would &s;oon lay a&s;ide his labour: the baker likewi&s;e reading, that a little leaven will cor|rupt
<PB N="9" REF="9">his lump, would give us very in&s;ipid bread: the &s;imple man likewi&s;e finding him|&s;elf commanded to pluck out his eyes&punc; in a few years we &s;hould have the nation full of blind beggars.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer could not help li&s;tening with a &s;ecret plea&s;ure to this ingenious rea&s;oning. Perhaps he had acted as prudently, if he had con&s;idered the prior's arguments as unan&s;wer|able; but he could not re&s;i&s;t the vivacity of his temper, which &s;trongly inclined him to expo&s;e this &s;olemn trifler.</P>
<P>The whole univer&s;ity met together on Sun|day, when it was known Mr. Latimer would preach&punc; That vein of plea&s;antry and hu|mour, which ran through all his words and actions would have here, it was imagined, full &s;cope: and, to &s;ay the truth, the preacher was not a little con&s;cious of his own &s;uperi|ority. To complete the &s;cene, ju&s;t before the &s;ermon began, prior Buckenham him&s;elf entered the church, with his coul about his &s;houlders; and &s;eated him&s;elf with an air of importance before the pulpit.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer, with great gravity, recapitu|lated the learned doctor's arguments, placed them in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and then rallied
<PB N="10" REF="10">them with &s;uch a flow of wit, and at the &s;ame time with &s;o much good humour, that, with|out the appearance of ill-nature, he made his adver&s;ary in the highe&s;t degree ridiculous. He then, with great addre&s;s, appealed to the people, de&s;canted upon the low e&s;teem in which their holy guides had always held their under&s;tandings; expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t offence at their being treated with &s;uch con|tempt, and wi&s;hed his hone&s;t countrymen might only have the u&s;e of the &s;cripture till they &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;uch ab&s;urd inter|preters. He concluded his di&s;cour&s;e with a few ob&s;ervations upon &s;cripture-metaphors. A figurative manner of &s;peech, he &s;aid, was common in all languages: repre&s;entations of this kind were in daily u&s;e, and generally un|der&s;tood. Thus for in&s;tance, &s;aid he, (ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to that part of the audience where the prior was &s;eated) when we &s;ee a fox painted preaching in a frier's hood, no|body imagines that a fox is meant, but that craft and hypocri&s;y are de&s;cribed, which are &s;o often found di&s;gui&s;ed in that garb.&mdash;Thus was a wi&s;e man led away by the impul&s;es of vanity, and highly delighted with the little glory of having made a dunce ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">But it is probable, Mr. Latimer thought this levity unbecoming: for when one Venetus, a foreigner, not long after attacked him again upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, and in manner the mo&s;t &s;currilous and provoking, we find him u&s;ing a graver &s;train. He an&s;wers like a &s;cho|lar, what is worth an&s;wering; and like a man of &s;en&s;e, leaves the ab&s;urd part to confute it|&s;elf. Whether he ridiculed however, or rea|&s;oned, with &s;o much of the &s;pirit of true oratory, con&s;idering the times, were his ha|rangues animated, that they &s;eldom failed of their intended effect: his raillery &s;hut up the prior within his mona&s;tery; and his argu|ments drove Venetus from the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages increa&s;ed the credit of the prote&s;tant party in Cambridge, of which Bilney and Latimer were at the head. The meekne&s;s, gravity, and unaffected piety of the former, and the cheerfulne&s;s, good humour, and eloquence of the latter, wrought much upon the junior &s;tudents.</P>
<P>The&s;e things greatly alarmed the orthodox clergy. Of this &s;ort were all the heads of colleges, and, indeed, the &s;enior part of the univer&s;ity. Frequent convocations were held; tutors were admoni&s;hed to have a &s;trict eye
<PB N="12" REF="12">over their pupils; and academical cen&s;ures of all kinds were inflicted.</P>
<P>But academical cen&s;ures were found in&s;uf|ficient. Mr. Latimer continued to preach, and here&s;y to &s;pread. The true &s;pirit of po|pery therefore began to exert it&s;elf, and to call aloud for the &s;ecular arm.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t was at that time bi&s;hop of Ely. To him, as their dioce&s;an, the heads of the popi&s;h party applied. But the bi&s;hop was not a man for their purpo&s;e: he was a papi&s;t in|deed, but moderate. He came to Cambridge however; examined the &s;tate of religion, and at their intreaty, preached again&s;t heretics: but he would do nothing farther. Only, in|deed, he &s;ilenced Mr. Latimer; which, as he had preached him&s;elf, was an in&s;tance of his prudence.</P>
<P>This gave no great check to the reformers. There happened at that time to be a prote|&s;tant prior in Cambridge, Dr. Barnes, of the Au&s;tin friers. His mona&s;tery was ex|empt from epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and being a great admirer of Mr. Latimer, he boldly licenced him to preach there. Hither his party followed him; and the late oppo&s;ition having greatly excited the curio&s;ity of the
<PB N="13" REF="13">people, the friers chapel was &s;oon unable to contain the crowds that attended. Among others, it is remarkable, that the bi&s;hop of Ely was often one of his hearers; and had the ingenuity to declare, that Mr. Latimer was one of the be&s;t preachers he had ever heard.</P>
<P>The credit to his cau&s;e which Mr. Latimer had thus gained by preaching, he maintained by a holy life. Mr. Bilney and he did not &s;a|tisfy them&s;elves with acting unexceptionably, but were daily giving in&s;tances of goodne&s;s, which malice could not &s;candalize, nor envy mi&s;interpret. They were always together concerting their &s;chemes. The place where they u&s;ed to walk, was long afterwards known by the name of the Heretics hill. Cambridge at the time was full of their good actions: their charities to the poor, and friendly vi&s;its to the &s;ick and unhappy, were then common topics.</P>
<P>But their good lives had no merit with their adver&s;aries. With them it mattered not what a man's life was, if his opinions were ortho|dox. They could give great allowances for the former; but the lea&s;t mi&s;take in the latter, was unpardonable. Such is the true &s;pirit of
<PB N="14" REF="14">bigotry and prie&s;tcraft; that phari&s;aical &s;pirit, which, inverting the tables of the law, places points of lea&s;t importance uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P>More of this &s;pirit never reigned than at this time in Cambridge. The popi&s;h party, among whom every &s;park of charity &s;eemed extingui&s;hed, were now inflamed to the utter|mo&s;t. The good actions of their adver&s;aries &s;erved only as fuel to increa&s;e the heat of per&s;ecution. Impotent them&s;elves, and find|ing their dioce&s;an either unable or unwilling to work their purpo&s;es, they determined at length upon an appeal to the higher powers. Here at lea&s;t, they expected countenance. Heavy complaints were accordingly carried to court of the increa&s;e of here&s;y; and formal depo&s;itions again&s;t the principal abettors of it.</P>
<P>But as a new &s;cene will here open, and dif|ferent characters make their appearance, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the times, and of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons then in action.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>PRote&s;tanti&s;m, which was now &s;preading it&s;elf apace in Germany, and many other parts of Europe, had yet met with no public countenance in England. There &s;uper&s;tition &s;till held its reign. The regular clergy, en|croaching more and more, had at length en|gro&s;&s;ed one third of the kingdom. A large &s;hare of temporal power was the con&s;equence of this wealth; and the gro&s;s ignorance of the times e&s;tabli&s;hed them as fully in a &s;piritual do|minion. From the days of Wicliff, who flou|ri&s;hed in the reign of Richard the &s;econd, many began to &s;peak with &s;ome freedom, and to think with more, of the prevailing cor|ruptions of popery. But &s;evere laws, pur|cha&s;ed of needy kings, and executed by cruel prie&s;ts, held the&s;e &s;ectaries in awe. The in|clinations of the people, however, through this whole period of time, ran &s;trong again&s;t the clergy; and Luther was more than a lit|tle obliged to Wicliff for his reception in England.</P>
<P>As &s;oon therefore as the opinions of the re|formers were introduced, they were warmly
<PB N="16" REF="16">e&s;pou&s;ed; the generality of the people were di&s;po&s;ed for them; and prote&s;tants in many places began to form parties. But in tho&s;e intolerant times when kings thought it incum|bent upon them to think for their Subjects, private opinion and the inclinations of the peo|ple were little con&s;ulted; rea&s;ons of &s;tate pre|vailed; and Henry the eighth, who then reigned in England, had yet his motives for holding fair with the court of Rome.</P>
<P>The great cau&s;e which at this time held the nation attentive, was the king's divorce; a &s;uit of Law one of the mo&s;t famous in hi|&s;tory. After cohabiting near twenty years with his brother's wife, this religious prince was &s;ud|denly &s;eized, upon the appearance of Ann Boleyn at court, with &s;cruples of con&s;cience about the legality of his marriage; and not only &s;choolmen and canoni&s;ts, but kings, popes, and emperors were intere&s;ted in this affair.</P>
<P>At that time one of the mo&s;t wily prelates held the &s;ee of Rome. He had intere&s;ts to manage with Charles the fifth, who was aver&s;e to the divorce. He had intere&s;ts likewi&s;e to manage with Henry. The&s;e cro&s;s circum&s;tan|ces called for all his &s;ubtility. And indeed he
<PB N="17" REF="17">&s;hewed him&s;elf a ma&s;ter of addre&s;s. He amu&s;|ed each in his turn, and meant hone&s;tly to nei|ther; perplexing affairs, palliating, explaining, and perplexing again, that he might thou|roughly deliberate before he cho&s;e his party. the emperor in the mean time was thorough|ly &s;atisfied with his conduct; and Henry thought him tardy indeed, but &s;till never doubt|ed his di&s;po&s;ition to &s;erve him. A legantine court was erected in England, and the affair went on with all the di&s;patch that two &s;olemn cardinals could make.</P>
<P>While the king thus expected an end of his bu&s;ine&s;s in a regular way, which of all things he de&s;ired, he was careful in ob&s;erving all forms of civility with the pope. The poor prote&s;tants in many in&s;tances felt the effects of his complai&s;ance. He even went &s;o far as to u&s;e his own princely pen again&s;t them; and, as the courtiers of his time u&s;ed to say, wrote incomparably well. No new laws indeed were enacted. The old ones again&s;t Wicliff's here&s;y were thought &s;ufficient. The&s;e &s;tatutes were revived, and the bi&s;hops in &s;everal parts of the kingdom took very effectual pains to make tho&s;e under their care acquainted with them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">The principal per&s;ons at this time con|cerned in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, were cardinal Wool&s;ey, Warham archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, and Tun&s;tal bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>Wool&s;ey had certainly as few virtues to qualify as many vices as mo&s;t men. Abili|ties indeed he had, the abilities of a &s;tate&s;|man; but his chief merit was a very artful application to his ma&s;ter's foibles, and the ad|dre&s;s to make him&s;elf thought u&s;eful: he could conde&s;cend even to &s;erve his plea&s;ures. Where his prince's humours did not inter|fere, the principal &s;prings of his conduct were ambition, pride, and avarice; all which vices he found the means to gratify in a man|ner unparalleled in Engli&s;h &s;tory. It was humourou&s;ly &s;aid, he held the church of England in commendam. As to matters of faith, he was ea&s;y, and was therefore indeed no zealot: in practice he &s;carce ob&s;erved de|cency; yet he was a great advocate for the reformation of the clergy; and contributed every way towards it, but by &s;etting a good example. He even went &s;o far as to counte|nance the prote&s;tants, becau&s;e he found that the be&s;t means of rou&s;ing the clergy to a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">Warham was now an old man. He had been the favourite of the la&s;t reign, and was practi&s;ed in all the artifices of Harry the &s;e|venth's policy; an able &s;tate&s;man, and an art|ful courtier. But he had out-lived his capa|city for bu&s;ine&s;s; had withdrawn him&s;elf from all court dependencies, and led at this time a very retired life; indulging a polite in|dolence among learned men, of whom he was a very great patron; him&s;elf a man of letters. The duties of his function, he thought, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in oppo&s;ing he|retics; and the &s;evere&s;t kind of oppo&s;ition he thought the be&s;t. In other re&s;pects he was a good man; would have been no di&s;grace to a better religion; and was an ornament to popery.</P>
<P>But of all the prelates of tho&s;e times, Cuth|bert Tun&s;tal, bi&s;hop of London, was mo&s;t de|&s;ervedly e&s;teemed. He was a papi&s;t only by profe&s;&s;ion; no way influenced by the &s;pirit of popery: but he was a good catholic, and had true notions of the genius of chri&s;tianity. He con&s;idered a good life as the end, and faith as the means; and never branded as an here|tic that per&s;on, however erroneous his opini|ons might be in points le&s;s fundamental, who

<PB N="20" REF="24">had &s;uch a belief in Chri&s;t, as made him live like a chri&s;tian. He was ju&s;t therefore the rever&s;e of Warham, and thought the per&s;ecu|tion of prote&s;tants one of the things mo&s;t fo|reign to his function. For parts and learning he was very eminent: his knowledge was ex|ten&s;ive, and his ta&s;te in letters &s;uperior to that of mo&s;t of his contemporaries. The great foible of which he &s;tands accu&s;ed in hi&s;tory, was the pliancy of his temper. Like mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops of tho&s;e times, he had been bred in a court; and was indeed too dextrous in the arts there practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of things, and &s;uch the per&s;ons in power, when complaints came from Cambridge of the daily increa&s;e of he|re&s;y. Tun&s;tal, with an air of &s;anctity, &s;hook his head, declaring it was &s;hameful indeed, very &s;hameful! Warham raged loud, and talked of nothing but fire and extirpation, root and branch. While the cardinal treated the whole as a je&s;t, attributing it to the envy of a few illiterate prie&s;ts again&s;t men of &s;u|perior merit.</P>
<P>But complaints from Cambridge increa&s;ing daily, and Warham of cour&s;e growing more importunate, the cardinal was at length obliged
<PB N="21" REF="25">to &s;hake off his indifference, and begin to act. He erected a court therefore, con&s;i&s;ting of bi&s;hops, divines, and canoni&s;ts. Tun&s;tal was made pre&s;ident; and Bilney, Latimer, and one or two more were called upon to an&s;wer for their conduit. Bilney was con&s;idered as the here&s;iarc, and again&s;t him chiefly, the rigour of the court was levelled. His examination was accordingly &s;evere: every witne&s;s was heard with &s;o much attention, and every de|po&s;ition enlarged upon with &s;o much bitter|ne&s;s, that Tun&s;tal de&s;paired of mixing any temper with the proceedings of his colleagues. The proce&s;s came to an end, and the criminal, declaring him&s;elf what they called an ob&s;ti|nate heretic, was found guilty. Here Tun|&s;tal had an opportunity to &s;hew the goodne&s;s of his heart. He could not interfere in Mr. Bilney's favour in a judicial way; but he la|boured to &s;ave him by all the means in his power. He fir&s;t &s;et his friends upon him, to per&s;uade him to recant; and when that would not do, he joined his intreaties to theirs, had patience with him day after day, and with all the tenderne&s;s of humanity, begged he would not oblige him, contrary to his inclinations, to treat him with &s;everity. The good bi&s;hop
<PB N="22" REF="26">in the end prevailed: Bilney could not with|&s;tand the winning rhetoric of Tun&s;tal, though he had with&s;tood all the menaces of the in|flamed Warham. He recanted, bore his fag|got, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As for Mr. Latimer and the re&s;t, they had ea&s;ier terms: Tun&s;tal omitted no opportuni|ties of &s;hewing mercy, and was dextrous in finding them; though it is probable, that among &s;o many voices, he would hardly have prevailed, if the cardinal had not countenanced his proceedings.</P>
<P>The heretics, upon their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, return|ed to Cambridge, where they were received with open arms by their friends. Amid&s;t this mutual joy, Bilney alone &s;eemed un|affected: he &s;hunned the fight of his acquaintance, and received their officious con|gratulations with confu&s;ion and blu&s;hes. Re|flection had now brought him to him&s;elf; and remor&s;e of con&s;cience had &s;eized him for what he had done. Re&s;tle&s;s nights, fright|ful dreams, and other effects of a mind that preys upon it&s;elf, in a &s;hort time di&s;turbed his rea&s;on; and it was feared he might have com|mitted &s;omething horrid, if tho&s;e about him had not clo&s;ely attended him. In the ago|nies
<PB N="23" REF="27">of his de&s;pair, his pathetic and eager accu&s;ations of his friends, of the bi&s;hop of London, and above all, of him&s;elf, were very affecting. Thus he continued for &s;ome time one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;pectacles that hu|man nature can exhibit. His pa&s;&s;ion having had its cour&s;e, at length &s;ub&s;ided; and by degrees gave place to a profound melan|choly. In this &s;tate he continued about three years, reading much, avoiding company, and in all re&s;pects ob&s;erving the &s;everity of an a&s;|cetic. During this time, and e&s;pecially to|wards the latter part of it, he would frequent|ly be throwing out ob&s;cure hints of his meditating &s;ome extraordinary de&s;ign. He would &s;ay, that he was now almo&s;t prepared &mdash; that he would &s;hortly go up to Jeru&s;a|lem&mdash; and that God mu&s;t be glorified in him. After keeping his friends awhile in &s;u&s;pen&s;e by this my&s;terious language, he told them at la&s;t, that he was fully determined to expiate his late &s;hameful abjuration by his death. What they could oppo&s;e, had no weight. He had taken his re&s;olution; and breaking at once from all his attachments in Cam|bridge, he &s;et out for Norfolk, which was the place of his nativity, and which, for that rea|&s;on,
<PB N="24" REF="28">he cho&s;e to make the &s;cene of his death. When he came there, he went about the country, confe&s;&s;ing his guilt in abjuring a faith, in which he was now determined to die. Popery, he told the people, was a mo&s;t diabolical religion; and exhorted them to beware of idolatry, and to tru&s;t no longer in the cowl of St. Francis, in prayers to &s;aints, in pilgrimages, penances, and indulgences; but rather to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to lead good lives, which was all that God re|quired of them.</P>
<P>The report of this very extraordinary preacher &s;oon reached the ears of the bi&s;hop of Norwich, who watched over tho&s;e parts with the zeal of an inqui&s;itor. Mr. Bilney was &s;oon apprehended, and &s;ecured in the county-gaol. While he lay there wai|ting the arrival of the writ for his execution, he gave very &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of a firm and collected mind. He began now to recover from that abject &s;tate of melancholy, which had for the&s;e la&s;t three years oppre&s;&s;ed him; and, like an hone&s;t man, who had long lived under a difficult debt, he began to re&s;ume his &s;pirits, when he thought him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to di&s;charge it. Some of his friends found
<PB N="25" REF="29">him eating a hearty &s;upper the night be|fore his execution, and expre&s;&s;ing their &s;ur|prize, he told them, he was but doing what they had daily examples of in common life: he was only keeping his cottage in repair, while he continued to inhabit it. The &s;ame compo&s;ure ran through his whole behaviour; and his conver&s;ation was that evening more agreeable than his friends almo&s;t ever remem|bered it. He dwelt much upon a pa&s;&s;age in I&s;aiah, which he &s;aid gave him much comfort. "Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; thou art mine. When thou walke&s;t in the fire, it &s;hall not burn thee: I am the Lord thy God." With equal con&s;tancy he went through his la&s;t trial. His death, which Mr. Fox relates at large, was as noble an in&s;tance of chri&s;tian courage, as tho&s;e times, fruitful of &s;uch examples, afforded. The popi&s;h party would have had it afterwards believed he died in their faith: and great pains were taken by many of them to propagate the &s;tory; parti|cularly by Sir Thomas Moore, who&s;e opinions in religion were as confined, as his &s;enti|ments upon all other &s;ubjects were enlarged: but Mr. Fox, bi&s;hop Burnet, and others, have &s;ufficiently refuted the many idle things which were &s;aid upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">The following account of him, Mr. Lati|mer hath left us in a letter to a friend.</P>
<P>"I have known Bilney, &s;ays he, a great while; and to tell you what I have always thought of him, I have known few &s;o ready to do every man good, after his power; noi&s;ome wittingly to none; and to|wards his enemy charitable, and reconcile|able. To be &s;hort, he was a very &s;imple, good &s;oul, nothing meet for this wretched world; who&s;e evil &s;tate he would lament and bewail, as much as any man that I ever knew. As for his &s;ingular learning, as well in the holy &s;criptures, as in other good let|ters, I will not now &s;peak of it. How he ordered, or mi&s;ordered him&s;elf in judgment, I cannot tell, nor will I meddle withal: but I cannot but wonder, if a man living &s;o mer|cifully, &s;o charitably, &s;o patiently, &s;o conti|nently, &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly, and &s;o virtuou&s;ly, &s;hould die an evil death."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Bilney's &s;ufferings, in&s;tead of check|ing the reformation at Cambridge, in|&s;pired the leaders of it with new courage; and illu&s;trated a common ob&s;ervation, that per&s;ecution is always an unadvi&s;ed mea&s;ure in oppo&s;ing religious innovations. Mr. Latimer began now to exert him&s;elf more than he had yet done; and &s;ucceeded to that credit with his party which Mr. Bilney had &s;o long &s;up|ported. Among other in&s;tances of his zeal and re&s;olution in this cau&s;e, he gave one, which was indeed very remarkable. He had the courage to write to the king again&s;t a pro|clamation then ju&s;t publi&s;hed, forbidding the u&s;e of the Bible in Engli&s;h, and other books on religious &s;ubjects. The affair was this.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the reformation had any footing in the kingdom, great care had been taken by the promoters of it to propagate among the people a variety of tracts, &s;ome on the points then in controver&s;y, others, and the greater part, on the corruptions of the clergy. The&s;e books were printed abroad, and &s;ent
<PB N="28" REF="32">over in great quantities. Among other works of this kind, a tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;ta|ment was di&s;per&s;ed. Great were the cla|mours of the orthodox again&s;t the&s;e malig|nant and pe&s;tiferous writings, as they were then called. But as the government did not interfere, the bi&s;hops could only u&s;e the au|thority of the laws then in force, in guarding each his dioce&s;e from the&s;e inva&s;ions of he|re&s;y. Epi&s;copal injunctions were accordingly publi&s;hed, and all po&s;&s;ible care was taken. But the laws then in force, did not intirely touch the ca&s;e: none of them were particu|larly pointed again&s;t. heretical books. Some|thing more therefore mu&s;t be obtained from the government.</P>
<P>It happened, that among other tracts then di&s;per&s;ed, there was one Written in a warmer language than ordinary. It was entitled, The Supplication of the Beggars, and contained a very &s;evere invective again&s;t. the regular clergy, who&s;e exorbitant exactions upon the people were there repre&s;ented as the chief &s;ource of all the poverty in the nation. This piece rou&s;ed the whole body of the clergy; and the cardinal being at their head, a &s;ucce&s;sful appli|cation was made to the king, who immediate|ly
<PB N="29" REF="33">i&s;&s;ued out a mo&s;t &s;evere proclamation again&s;t heretical books, commanding that all &s;uch books &s;hould be delivered up within fifteen days, and impowering the bi&s;hops to impri&s;on at plea&s;ure all per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of having them, till the party had purged him&s;elf, or abjured: it impowered the bi&s;hops likewi&s;e to &s;et an arbitrary fine upon all per&s;ons convict|ed. It farther forbad all appeals from eccle|&s;ia&s;tical courts; and obliged all civil officers, by oath, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to ex|tirpate here&s;y, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the bi&s;hops; ju&s;tices were to inquire, at their quarterly &s;e&s;&s;ions, in|to the &s;tate of religion in their counties; and &s;heriffs were to arre&s;t all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and deliver them to the bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The &s;word thus put into the hands of the bi&s;hops, was pre&s;ently un&s;heathed. The ef|fects of this proclamation, and in that reign proclamations had the force of law, were in|deed very dreadful. It would &s;urpri&s;e the good people of England at this day to hear, that many of their forefathers were then burnt for reading the Bible, and teaching their chil|dren the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer in Engli&s;h. Such things were then called here&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="34">On this occa&s;ion Mr. Latimer took upon him to write to the king. He had preached before him once or twice at Wind&s;or, and had been taken notice of by him in a more af|fable manner than that monarch u&s;ually in|dulged towards his &s;ubjects. But whatever hopes of preferment his &s;overeign's favour might have rai&s;ed in him, he cho&s;e to put all to the hazard, rather than to omit what he thought his duty. He was generally con&s;i|dered as one of the mo&s;t eminent of tho&s;e who favoured prote&s;tanti&s;m; and therefore thought it became him to be one of the mo&s;t forward in oppo&s;ing popery. His letter is the picture of an hone&s;t, &s;incere heart. It was chiefly intended to point out to the king the bad intention of the bi&s;hops in procuring the proclamation. The &s;ub&s;tance of it is as follows.</P>
<P>St. Augu&s;tin, in an epi&s;tle to Ca&s;ulanus, tells us, "That he who through fear, hideth the truth, provoketh the wrath of heaven, as a per&s;on who fears man more than God." And St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, to the &s;ame effect, gives it as his opinion, "That a per&s;on may betray the truth, as well by concealing it, as di&s;|gui&s;ing it." The&s;e &s;entences, great king, oc|curred
<PB N="31" REF="35">to me very lately; and have had &s;uch an effect upon me, that I mu&s;t either open my con&s;cience to your maje&s;ty, or rank my|&s;elf among &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e two holy fa|thers cen&s;ure.&mdash;The latter I cannot think of.</P>
<P>But, alas! there are men upon whom &s;uch &s;evere cen&s;ures have no effect: there are men, who, pretending to be guides and teachers in religion, not only conceal the truth, but pro|hibit others to &s;et it forth: blind guides, who &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven from men, and will neither enter in them&s;elves, neither &s;uffer them that would, to enter. And not content with ob&s;tructing the word of God to the utmo&s;t of their own authority, they have contrived by their &s;ubtil practices to draw in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance the civil power in almo&s;t all the &s;tates of chri&s;tendom. In this nation e&s;pe|cially, they have long impo&s;ed upon their &s;ub|jects by their delu&s;ions, and kept them in awe by their &s;piritual cen&s;ures; and when they &s;aw the truth likely to prevail, and gather &s;trength from their oppo&s;ition, they have at length ob|tained your maje&s;ty's proclamation in their fa|vour, and have got it declared trea&s;on to read the &s;cripture in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="36">Hear me, I be&s;eech your maje&s;ty, a few words, and let me intreat you to call to mind the example of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, their manner of life, their preaching, and whole behaviour; that comparing them with the &s;piritual guides of the&s;e days, your maje&s;ty may the better judge who are the true follow|ers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t it is evident, that &s;implicity of manners, and hearts &s;eque&s;tered from the world, were the &s;triking characteri&s;tics of the fir&s;t preachers of the go&s;pel, and of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf. Poverty in &s;pirit was then practi&s;ed as well as preached. Alas! it is &s;ince tho&s;e days that chri&s;tian teachers, ma&s;k|ing their worldly hearts under a pretence of voluntary poverty, and an exclu&s;ion from car|nal things, have wormed them&s;elves into more than regal wealth; and have wickedly kept what they have craftily obtained, by fomenting foreign or dome&s;tic &s;trife, in all places, as their purpo&s;es were be&s;t &s;erved; and by bla&s;phe|mou&s;ly dealing out even the puni&s;hments of heaven again&s;t all who had re&s;olution enough to make any &s;tand again&s;t their corruptions. By what arts they have evaded a late act of parliament again&s;t their encroachments, your
<PB N="33" REF="37">maje&s;ty well knows. &mdash; Think not, gracious &s;overeign, that I exceed the bounds of charity in what I &s;ay: I only offer to your maje&s;ty's con&s;ideration a rule, which was once pre|&s;cribed by a greater ma&s;ter, "By their fruits you &s;hall know them."</P>
<P>Another mark of the true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, is their being at all times expo&s;ed to per&s;ecution. It would be endle&s;s to quote all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in which this burden is univer&s;ally laid upon good chri&s;tians. Contempt and reproach is their common lot, and often the mo&s;t violent per&s;ecutions, even to death it&s;elf. Where-ever, therefore, the word of God is truly preached, you mu&s;t ex|pect to &s;ee per&s;ecution in one &s;hape or other. On the contrary, where-ever you &s;ee ea&s;e and luxury, and a quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of worldly plea|&s;ures, there the truth cannot po&s;&s;ibly be. For the world loveth only &s;uch as are worldly; and the favourers of the go&s;pel can expect no|thing in it from rea&s;on, and are promi&s;ed no|thing in it by &s;cripture, but vexation and trouble.&mdash;From this di&s;tinction again, your maje&s;ty, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the above-men|tioned rule, "By their fruits you &s;hall know them," will be able to judge, who are the
<PB N="34" REF="38">true followers of Chri&s;t: where-ever you ob|&s;erve per&s;ecution, there is more than a proba|bility that the truth lies on the per&s;ecuted &s;ide.</P>
<P>As for a notion, which has been infu&s;ed into your maje&s;ty, that the &s;criptures in the hands of the people might move them to re|bellion, your maje&s;ty may judge of the fal&s;e|hood of this likewi&s;e by the &s;ame rule: "By their fruit you &s;hall know them." How is it po&s;&s;ible, that a book, which inculcates obedience to magi&s;trates with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, can be the cau&s;e of &s;edition? The thing &s;peaks it&s;elf, and di&s;covers only how much their malice is at a lo&s;s for topics of in|vective.</P>
<P>When king David &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the young king of the Ammonites to con|dole with him upon the death of his father, your maje&s;ty may remember what unadvi&s;ed coun&s;el was given to that ra&s;h prince. His coun&s;ellors put it into his head, contrary to all rea&s;on, that David's me&s;&s;engers came only as &s;pies, and that David certainly meant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inva&s;ion. The young king, upon this, with|out farther ceremony, wantonly &s;haved the heads of the amba&s;&s;adors, and treated them with other in&s;tances of contempt. But the
<PB N="35" REF="39">following ver&s;es inform us, how the affair ended. The de&s;truction of the whole land, we read, was the con&s;equenee of the king's li&s;tening to imprudent coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Let not, great king, this fact find its parallel in Engli&s;h &s;tory. The amba&s;&s;adors of a great prince are now making &s;uit to you; the holy evangeli&s;ts, and apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t. Be upon your guard; and believe not the idle tales of tho&s;e who would per&s;uade you, that the&s;e me&s;&s;engers of peace are coming to foment &s;edition in your land. Would your maje&s;ty know the true cau&s;e of this confederacy, as I may well call it, again&s;t the word of God; examine the lives of tho&s;e who are the leaders of it, and con&s;ider whether there may not be &s;ome private rea&s;ons inducing &s;uch per&s;ons to keep a book in concealment, which cries out loudly again&s;t all kinds of vice. And if your maje&s;ty wants to know the &s;ource of rebel|lions, I think a much fairer one may be con|jectured at, than the u&s;e of an Engli&s;h Bible. For my own part, I have long been of opini|on, that a greater encouragement of all kinds of civil di&s;order could hardly have been in|vented, than the church-trade of pardons and indulgences: to which may be added the bad
<PB N="36" REF="40">examples of the clergy, and the little care they are generally thought to take in the di&s;charge of their duty.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who are now in que&s;tion about your maje&s;ty's late proclamation, I am credibly informed, there is not one among them, who hath not in every re&s;pect, demeaned him&s;elf as a peaceable and good &s;ubject; excepting only this one ca&s;e, in which they thought their religion and con&s;ciences concerned. In this particular, however, I excu&s;e them not: nor will I take upon me intirely to defend the books for which they &s;uffer; for indeed, ma|ny of them I have never read: only this your maje&s;ty mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, that it is impo&s;&s;ible the many inconveniences can fol|low from the&s;e books, and e&s;pecially from the &s;cripture, which they would per&s;uade man|kind, will follow.</P>
<P>Accept, gracious &s;overeign, without di&s;|plea&s;ure, what I have written. I thought it my duty to mention the&s;e things to your ma|je&s;ty. No per&s;onal quarrel, as God &s;hall judge me, have I with any man: I wanted only to induce your maje&s;ty to con&s;ider well what kind of per&s;ons you have about you, and the ends for which they coun&s;el: indeed, great
<PB N="37" REF="41">prince, many of them, or they are much &s;lan|dered, have very private ends. God grant your maje&s;ty may &s;ee through all the de&s;igns of evil men: and be in all things equal to the high office with which you are entru&s;ted!</P>
<P>He concludes his letter with the&s;e very emphatical words.</P>
<P>"Wherefore, gracious king, remember your&s;elf: have pity upon your own &s;oul; and think that the day is at hand, when you &s;hall give account of your office, and of the blood that hath been &s;hed by your &s;word. In the which day, that your grace may &s;tand &s;tedfa&s;tly, and not be a&s;hamed, but be clear and ready in your reckoning, and have your pardon &s;ealed with the blood of our Saviour Chri&s;t, which only &s;erveth at that day, is my daily prayer to him who &s;uffered death for our &s;ins. The Spirit of God pre&s;erve you!"</P>
<P>With &s;uch freedom did this true mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel addre&s;s his &s;overeign. But the influence of the popi&s;h party was then &s;o great, that his letter produced no effect. The king, however, no way di&s;plea&s;ed, received it not only with temper, but with great con|de&s;cen&s;ion, graciou&s;ly thanking him for his
<PB N="38" REF="42">well-intended advice. This monarch notwith|&s;tanding his many vices, would frequently in|dulge a very generous manner of thinking. He was him&s;elf generally open in his beha|viour; and was a great lover of &s;incerity in others. Plainne&s;s and hone&s;ty were com|monly &s;ure of his attention. And though no man was more impatient of controul, or na|turally more ha&s;ty upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, and violent than he was, yet he would often hear the truth, and the truth indeed &s;poken with great freedom, from tho&s;e, of who&s;e &s;incerity he was thoroughly convinced. I make the&s;e remarks chiefly becau&s;e Mr. Latimer was a per&s;on who&s;e plain and &s;imple manner had made a favourable impre&s;&s;ion upon him; which good opinion this letter contributed not a little to &s;trengthen.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE king's divorce was not yet brought to an i&s;&s;ue. The pope, terrified by an imperial army hovering over him, and yet afraid of the defection of England, was &s;till endeavouring, as was &s;aid, to hold the balance even between Charles V. and Henry. The legantine court therefore, under the influence of Rome, was not ha&s;ty in its determinations. But the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uit at length got the better of the king of England's patience. His incontroulable &s;pirit broke out; and find|ing him&s;elf duped by the pope, he di&s;claim|ed his authority in the affair, took it into his own hands, and had it determined within his own realm. Having gone thus far in defiance of the &s;ee of Rome, and finding his throne yet un&s;haken by any of its efforts, he was proceeding farther. But the pope beginning to temporize, a reconciliation was thought at hand. The imperial faction, however, once again prevailed; Henry's mea&s;ures were tra|ver&s;ed; and him&s;elf, in the per&s;on of his am|ba&s;&s;ador, treated with indignity.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44">Hitherto Henry was &s;ecretly inclined to a reconciliation with Rome; but his re&s;ent|ment of this u&s;age took &s;uch intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, that from this time he determined ab&s;olutely to throw off the papal yoke. Upon &s;uch &s;lender pivots, as even the pa&s;&s;ions of men, do the grand &s;chemes of providence often turn!</P>
<P>Soon after Henry had taken this re&s;olu|tion, the affair was brought into parliament; and the king's &s;upremacy was every where the popular topic.</P>
<P>The u&s;urpations of the pope had, be|fore this time, been the &s;ubject of a par|liamentary inquiry. Through many pre|ceeding reigns, the exactions of the holy &s;ee had been &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, that the legi&s;lature was often applied to for redre&s;s; and many laws, breathing a noble &s;pirit of freedom, had been enacted, by which the Roman power was much abridged. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t fa|mous were the &s;tatute again&s;t the pope's tax|gatherers, commonly called the &s;tature again&s;t provi&s;ors; and the &s;tatute of praemunire, pro|hibiting bulls and other in&s;truments from Rome. The word praemunire, which gave name to the &s;tatute, was one of the capital words in the writ, upon which it was executed.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="45">But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, and many other bold laws were enacted, no effect was pro|duced. They were promulged, and laid a&s;ide. The influence of the vatican was indeed yet too con&s;iderable to &s;uffer any very &s;pirited at|tacks upon its power.</P>
<P>Neglected however as the&s;e &s;tatutes were, they &s;erved as precedents for Henry's parlia|ment; which concurred intirely with the king's inclinations. Luther's exceptions were now growing popular: every year brought &s;omething to light, which prejudiced men more again&s;t the doctrine, or the di&s;cipline, or the prie&s;thood of the church of Rome. The parliament therefore wanted little inducement to turn their councils upon any thing which tended to reformation. Thus the king, with le&s;s difficulty than commonly attends &s;uch im|portant revolutions, got the pope's power abro|gated in England, and his own &s;upremacy e&s;tabli&s;hed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>The part which Mr. Latimer acted in this affair, was one of the fir&s;t things which brought him forward in life.</P>
<P>Whatever motives in earne&s;t influenced king Henry, he had always policy enough to pay an outward regard at lea&s;t to tho&s;e of con|&s;cience.
<PB N="42" REF="46">He took care therefore to re&s;olve his &s;cruples, before he gratified his pa&s;&s;ions. Thus he had the opinion of all the divines in Europe, before he ventured upon his divorce. And thus, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ert his &s;upremacy, till he had con&s;ulted with the able&s;t canoni&s;ts of his realm, and fully &s;atisfied him&s;elf, that what he did, was agreeable to the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who &s;erved him in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, was Dr. Butts, his phy&s;ician; who, from the &s;lender accounts pre&s;erved of him in hi&s;tory, appears to have been a per&s;on of great hone&s;ty, learning, and humanity. Mr. Fox calls him "a &s;ingular good man, and a &s;pecial favourer of good proceedings."</P>
<P>This gentleman being &s;ent to Cambridge up|on the occa&s;ion mentioned, began immediately to pay his court to the prote&s;tant party, from whom the king expected mo&s;t unanimity in his favour. Among the fir&s;t, he made his application to Mr. Latimer, as a per&s;on mo&s;t likely to &s;erve him; begging that he would collect the opinions of his friends in the ca&s;e, and do his utmo&s;t to bring over tho&s;e of mo&s;t eminence, who were &s;till inclined to the pa|pacy.
<PB N="43" REF="47">Mr. Latimer, who was a thorough friend to the cau&s;e he was to &s;olicit, under|took it with his u&s;ual zeal; and di&s;charged him&s;elf &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of the doctor, that when that gentleman returned to court, he took Mr. Latimer along with him; with a view, no doubt, to procure him &s;omething an&s;werable to his merit.</P>
<P>About this time a per&s;on was ri&s;ing into power, who became afterwards Mr. Latimer's chief friend and patron; the great lord Cromwell: a per&s;on in all re&s;pects &s;o formed for command, that we admire him, through hi&s;tory, as &s;omething more than human, as one of tho&s;e great in&s;truments, which provi|dence often rai&s;es up, and &s;eems to in&s;pire, for &s;ome grand purpo&s;e. His de&s;cent was mean, but his enterpri&s;ing genius &s;oon rai&s;ed him above the ob&s;curity of his birth. We fir&s;t find him abroad, leading a wild, romantic life in various capacities. In Holland he was a hackney writer; in Italy a foot &s;oldier. After &s;pending a very di&s;&s;ipated youth in this vague way, he returned home, and was taken into the &s;ervice of cardinal Wool&s;ey, who in a &s;hort time made him his &s;ecretary. Under this &s;agacious mini&s;ter he began to methodize
<PB N="44" REF="48">the large fund of knowledge he had been trea&s;uring up; and was &s;oon valued by the cardinal, who was by no means ill-&s;erved, as one of the able&s;t of his &s;ervants. The cardi|nal's fall was his ri&s;e: but he ro&s;e not, like mo&s;t favourites, by betraying, but by defend|ing his ma&s;ter. Wool&s;ey had arrived at the full meridian of his glory; that critical point, at which human grandeur begins to decline. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mini&s;ter was now at bay, pre&s;&s;ed hard by a parliamentary inquiry. The king had withdrawn his favour from him, and all his dependents (tho&s;e &s;ummer|flies of a great man's &s;un&s;hine) began to &s;hrink and die away. Cromwell alone, with a ge|nero&s;ity almo&s;t unparalleled in hi&s;tory, boldly maintained his cau&s;e; and pleaded for him &s;o forcibly before the commons, that if his ruin had not been a thing re&s;olved on, he bid fair to avert it. Wool&s;ey fell; but Cromwell's ge|nero&s;ity was rewarded. The king was plea&s;ed with his behaviour, marked his abilities, from that time favoured, and &s;oon employed him. His great talents quickly recommended him to the highe&s;t tru&s;ts; and his &s;overeign u&s;ed his &s;ervices almo&s;t implicitly.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="49">As this eminent per&s;on was a friend to the reformation, he encouraged of cour&s;e &s;uch churchmen, as were inclined towards it. Among others, Mr. Latimer was one of his favourites; to whom he took all opportuni|ties of &s;hewing his regard: and as Mr. Lati|mer had at this time no employment in Lon|don, his patron very &s;oon obtained a benefice for him.</P>
<P>This benefice was in Wilt&s;hire, whither Mr. Latimer re&s;olved, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to repair, and keep a con&s;tant re&s;idence. His friend Dr. Butts, &s;urpri&s;ed at his re&s;olution, did what he could to per&s;uade him from it. "He was de&s;erting, he told him, the faire&s;t appearances of making his fortune. The prime mini&s;ter, &s;ays he, intends this only as an earne&s;t of his future favours; and will cer|tainly in time, do great things for you. But it is the manner of courts to con&s;ider tho&s;e as provided for, who &s;eem to be &s;atisfied: and take my word for it, an ab&s;ent claimant &s;tands but a poor chance among rivals, who have the advantage of being pre&s;ent." Thus the old courtier advi&s;ed. But Mr. Latimer was not a man on whom &s;uch arguments had any weight. He had no other notion of making
<PB N="46" REF="50">his fortune, than that of putting him&s;elf in a way of being u&s;eful. Great and good, were with him words of the &s;ame meaning. And though he knew his friend's advice was well meant, yet he knew at the &s;ame time, that a man may as ea&s;ily be deceived by the kindne&s;s of his friend, as by the guile of his enemy. Be&s;ides, he was heartily tired of a court. He had yet &s;een little of the world; and was &s;hocked to be introduced at once to a place, where he &s;aw vice in every &s;hape triumphant: where factions raged: where all the arts of malice were practi&s;ed; where vanity and folly prevailed, debauchery of manners, di&s;&s;imula|tion, and irreligion: where he not only &s;aw the&s;e things, but what mo&s;t grieved him, where he found him&s;elf utterly unable to op|po&s;e them: for he had neither authority, nor, as he thought, talents, to reclaim the great. He left the court therefore, and en|tered immediately upon the duties of his pari&s;h; hoping to be of &s;ome u&s;e in the world, by faithfully exerting, in a private &s;ta|tion, &s;uch abilities as God had given him.</P>
<P>His behaviour was &s;uitable to his re&s;olutions. He thoroughly con&s;idered the office of a cler|gyman; and di&s;charged it in the mo&s;t con|&s;cientious
<PB N="47" REF="51">manner. Nor was he &s;atisfied with di&s;charging it in his own pari&s;h, but extended his labours throughout the county, where he ob&s;erved the pa&s;toral care mo&s;t neglected; having for this purpo&s;e obtained a general li|cence from the univer&s;ity of Cambridge.</P>
<P>His preaching, which was in a &s;train wholly different from the preaching of the times, &s;oon made him acceptable to the people; among whom, in a little time, he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in great credit. He was treated like|wi&s;e very civilly by the neighbouring gentry; and at Bri&s;tol, where he often preached, he was countenanced by the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The reputation he was thus daily gaining, pre&s;ently alarmed the orthodox clergy in tho&s;e parts. Their oppo&s;ition to him appeared fir&s;t on this occa&s;ion: the mayor of Bri&s;tol had appointed him to preach there on an Ea&s;ter-&s;unday. Public notice had been given, and all people were plea&s;ed: when &s;uddenly, there came out an order from the bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, prohibiting any one to preach there with|out his licence. The clergy of the place waited upon Mr. Latimer, informed him of the bi&s;hop's order, and, knowing that he had no &s;uch licence, "were extremely &s;orry
<PB N="48" REF="52">that they were by that means deprived of the plea&s;ure of hearing an excellent di&s;cour&s;e from him." Mr. Latimer received their civility with a &s;mile; for he had been apprized of the affair, and well knew, that the&s;e were the very per&s;ons who had written to the bi&s;hop again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Their oppo&s;ition to him became afterwards more public. Some of them a&s;cended the pulpit in their zeal, and inveighed again&s;t him there with great indecency of language. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t forward was one Hubberdin, an empty, impudent fellow, who could &s;ay no|thing of his own, but any thing that was put into his mouth. Through this in&s;trument, and others of the &s;ame kind, &s;uch liberties were taken with Mr. Latimer's character, that he thought it proper at length to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf; and accordingly called upon his maligners to accu&s;e him publicly before the mayor of Bri&s;tol. And with all men of candour he was ju&s;tified; for when that magi&s;trate convened both parties, and put the accu&s;ers upon pro|ducing legal proof of what they had &s;aid, nothing of that kind appeared; but the whole accu&s;ation was left to re&s;t upon the uncertain evidence of &s;ome hear-&s;ay information.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="53">His enemies, however, were not thus &s;ilenced. The party again&s;t him became daily &s;tronger and more inflamed. It con|&s;i&s;ted in general of the country prie&s;ts of tho&s;e parts, headed by &s;ome divines of more emi|nence.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;on, after mature deliberation, drew up articles again&s;t him, extracted chiefly from his &s;ermons; in which he was charged with &s;peaking lightly of the wor&s;hip of &s;aints; with &s;aying, that there was no material fire in hell; and that he would rather be in pur|gatory, than in Lollard's tower. The&s;e arti|cles, in the form of an accu&s;ation, were laid before &s;toke&s;ley bi&s;hop of London. This prelate immediately cited Mr. Latimer to ap|pear before him. But Mr. Latimer, in&s;tead of obeying the citation, appealed to his own ordinary; thinking him&s;elf wholly exempt from the juri&s;diction of any other bo&s;hop. Stoke&s;ley, upon this, making a private cau&s;e of it, was determined at any rate to get him in his power. He applied therefore to arch|bi&s;hop Warham, who&s;e zeal was nearly of a temper with his own malice. The arch|bi&s;hop, being ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, cited Mr. La|timer to appear forthwith in his own court;
<PB N="50" REF="54">where the bi&s;hop of London, and &s;ome other bi&s;hops were commi&s;&s;ioned to examine him. An archiepi&s;copal citation brought Mr. Lati|mer at once to a compliance. His friends would have had him leave the country; but their per&s;ua&s;ions were in vain. Before he &s;et out for London, he wrote the following letter to a friend.</P>
<P>"I marvel not a little, that my lord of London, having &s;o large a dioce&s;e committed to his care, and &s;o peopled as it is, can have lei&s;ure either to trouble me, or to trouble him&s;elf with me, &s;o poor a wretch, a &s;tranger to him, and nothing pertaining to his cure. Methinks it were more comely for my lord, if it were comely for me to &s;ay &s;o, to be a preacher him&s;elf, than to he a di&s;quieter of preachers. If it would plea&s;e his lord&s;hip to take &s;o great labour and pain, as to come and preach in my little bi&s;hopric at We&s;tking|ton, whether I were pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, I would thank his lord&s;hip heartily for helping to di&s;|charge me in my cure, as long as his predica|tion was fruitful, and to the edification of my pari&s;hioners. But he may do as he plea&s;eth: I pray God he may do as well as I would wi&s;h him to do: and as to my preaching, I tru&s;t in
<PB N="51" REF="55">God, my lord of London cannot ju&s;tly re|prove it, if it be taken as I &s;pake it; el&s;e it is not my preaching.</P>
<Q><L>Quem recitas meus e&s;t, &ocirc; Fidentine libellus;</L>
<L>Sed male cum recitas, incipit e&s;&s;e tuus.</L></Q>
<P>Either my lord of London will judge mine outward man, or mine inward man. If he will have to do only with mine outward man, how I have ordered my life, I tru&s;t I &s;hall plea&s;e both my Lord God, and al&s;o my lord of London; for I have taught but according to the &s;criptures, and the antient interpreters of &s;criptures; and with all diligence moved my auditors to faith and charity; and as for voluntary things, I reproved the abu&s;e, with|out condemning the things them&s;elves. But if my lord will needs invade my inward man, and break violently into my heart, I fear then, indeed, I may di&s;plea&s;e my lord of London. Finally; as you &s;ay, the matter is weighty, even as weighty as my life is worth, and ought to be well looked to; how to look well to it I know not, otherwi&s;e than to pray to my Lord God night and day, that as he hath boldened me to preach his truth, &s;o he will &s;trengthen me to &s;uffer for it. And I tru&s;t that God will
<PB N="52" REF="56">help me; which tru&s;t, if I had not, the ocean &s;ea &s;hould have divided my lord of London and me by this time."</P>
<P>In this chri&s;tian temper Mr. Latimer &s;et out for London. It was in the depth of win|ter, and he was at this time labouring under a &s;evere fit, both of the &s;tone and cholic. The&s;e things were hard upon him; but what mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him was, the thought of leaving his pari&s;h &s;o expo&s;ed, where the popi&s;h clergy would not fail to undo, in his ab&s;ence, what he had hitherto done.</P>
<P>When he arrived in London, he found a court of bi&s;hops and canoni&s;ts a&s;&s;embled to receive him; where, in&s;tead of being examin|ed, as he expected, about his &s;ermons, the following paper was offered to him, which he was ordered to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>"<HI>I believe,</HI> that there is a purgatory to purge the &s;ouls of the dead after this life&mdash;that the &s;ouls in purgatory are holpen with the ma&s;&s;es, prayers, and alms of the living&mdash;that the &s;aints do pray as mediators for us in heaven &mdash; that it is profitable for chri&s;tians to call upon the &s;aints, that they may pray as me|diators for as unto God &mdash; that pilgrimages and oblations done to the &s;epulchres and re|liques
<PB N="53" REF="57">of &s;aints, are meritorious &mdash; that they which have vowed perpetual cha&s;tity, may not break their vow, without the di&s;pen&s;ation of the pope &mdash; that the keys of binding and loo&s;ing delivered to Peter, do &s;till remain with the bi&s;hops of Rome his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, although they live wickedly; and are by no means; nor at any time committed to laymen &mdash; that men may merit at God's hand by fa&s;ting, prayer, and other works or piety &mdash; that they which are forbidden of the bi&s;hop to preach, as &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, ought to cea&s;e until they have purged them&s;elves before the &s;aid bi&s;hop &mdash;that the fa&s;t which is u&s;ed in Lent, and other fa&s;ts pre&s;cribed by the canons are to be ob&s;erved &mdash;that God, in every one of the &s;even &s;acra|ments, giveth grace to a man rightly receiving the &s;ame&mdash;that con&s;ecrations, &s;anctifyings, and ble&s;&s;ings, by cu&s;tom received into the church, are profitable&mdash;that it is laudable and profit|able that the venerable images of the crucifix, and other &s;aints, &s;hould be had in the church as a remembrance, and to the honour and wor&s;hip of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his &s;aints&mdash;that it is laudable and profitable to deck and clothe tho&s;e images, and to &s;et up burning lights be|fore them, to the honour of the &s;aid &s;aints."</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58">This paper being offered to Mr. Latimer, he read it over, and returned it again, refu&s;ing to &s;ign it. The archbi&s;hop, with a frown, begged he would con&s;ider what he did. "We intend not, &s;ays he, Mr. Latimer, to be hard upon you: we di&s;mi&s;s you for the pre&s;ent: take a copy of the articles; examine them carefully; and God grant, that at our next meeting, we may find each other in bet|ter temper."</P>
<P>At the next meeting, and at &s;everal &s;uc|ceeding ones, the &s;ame &s;cene was acted over again: both &s;ides continued inflexible.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops, however, being determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to make him comply, began to treat him with more &s;everity. Of one of the&s;e examinations he gives us the following ac|count.</P>
<P>"I was brought one, &s;ays he, to be examined in a chamber, where I was wont to be examin|ed; but at this time it was &s;omewhat altered. For whereas before there wae a fire in the chimney now the five was taken away, and an arras hanged over the chimney; and the table &s;tood near the chimney's end. There was among the&s;e bi&s;hops that examined me, one with whom I have been very familiar, and
<PB N="55" REF="59">whom I took for my great friend, an aged man, and he &s;at next the table-end. Then among other que&s;tons he put forth one, a very &s;ubtil and crafty one; and when I &s;hould make an|&s;wer," "I pray you, Mr. Latimer, &s;aid he, &s;peak out, I am very thick of hearing, and here be many that &s;it far off." "I marvelled at this, that I was bidden to &s;peak out, and began to mi&s;deem and gave an ear to the chimney; and there I heard a pen plainly &s;cratching behind the cloth. They had ap|pointed one there to write all my an&s;wers, that I &s;hould not &s;tart from them. God was my good Lord, and gave me an&s;wers, I could never el&s;e have e&s;caped them."</P>
<P>Thus the bi&s;hops continued to di&s;tre&s;s Mr. Latimer; three times every week they regularly &s;ent for him, with a view either to elicit &s;ome|thing from him by captious que&s;tions; or to teaze him at length into a compliance.</P>
<P>And indeed, at length, he was tired out. His &s;pirit could no longer bear the u&s;age he met with. Accordingly, when he was next &s;ummoned, in&s;tead of going him&s;elf, he &s;ent a letter to the archbi&s;hop, in which, with great freedom, he tells him, "That the treat|ment he had of late met with, had fretted
<PB N="56" REF="60">him into &s;uch a di&s;order, as rendered him unfit to attend them that day &mdash; that in the mean time, he could not help taking this op|portunity to expo&s;tulate with his grace, for detaining him &s;o long from the di&s;charge of his duty&mdash;that it &s;eemed to him mo&s;t unac|countable, that they, who never preached them&s;elves, &s;hould hinder others&mdash;that as for their examination of him, he really could not imagine what they aimed at; they pretended one thing in the beginning, and another in the progre&s;s&mdash;that if his &s;ermons were what gave offence, which he per&s;uaded him&s;elf were neither contrary to the truth, nor to any canon of the church, he was ready to an&s;wer what|ever might be thought exceptionable in them&mdash;that he wi&s;hed a little more regard might be had to the judgment of the people; and that a di&s;tinction might be made between the ordinances of God and man &mdash; that if &s;ome abu&s;es in religion did prevail (as was then commonly &s;uppo&s;ed) he thought preach|ing was the be&s;t means to di&s;countenance them&mdash;that he wi&s;hed all pa&s;tors might be obliged to perform their duty; but that, however, li|berty might be given to tho&s;e who were wil|ling&mdash;that as for the articles propo&s;ed to him,
<PB N="57" REF="61">he begged to be excu&s;ed from &s;ub&s;cribing them; while he lived he never would abet &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;and that, la&s;tly, he hoped the archbi&s;hop would excu&s;e what he had writ|ten&mdash;he knew his duty to his &s;uperiors, and would practi&s;e it; but in that ca&s;e, he thought a &s;tronger obligation laid upon him."</P>
<P>What particular effect this letter produced, we are not informed; the bi&s;hops how|ever &s;till continued their per&s;ecution. But by an unexpected accident their &s;chemes were &s;uddenly fru&s;trated. The king being informed of the ill u&s;age Mr. Latimer met with, mo&s;t probably by the lord Cromwell's means, interpo&s;ed in his behalf, and re&s;cu|ed him out of the hands of his enemies. Mr. Fox leaves it in doubt, whether he was not at length prevailed upon to &s;ub&s;cribe the bi&s;hops articles: but I think it pa&s;t di&s;|pute that he did not: for if he had, what occa&s;ion had the king to interpo&s;e?</P>
<P>The unfortunate Ann Boleyn was at that time the favourite wife of Henry. She had imbibed from her youth the principles of the reformation, and continued &s;till in|clined to it. Whether &s;he had been acquaint|ed with Mr. Latimer before &s;he met with
<PB N="58" REF="62">him now at court, does not appear: &s;he was extremely taken however with his &s;im|plicity, and apo&s;tolic appearance; and men|tioned him to her friends as a per&s;on, in her opinion, as well qualified as any &s;he had &s;een to forward the reformation. One of her friends, and as much her favourite as any, was the lord Cromwell, who failed not, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, to rai&s;e Mr. Latimer &s;till higher in her e&s;teem. In &s;hort, the queen and the mini&s;ter agreed in thinking, that he was a man endowed with too many public virtues to be &s;uffered to live ob&s;cure in a pri|vate &s;tation; and joined in an earne&s;t recom|mendation of him to the king for a bi&s;hopric. Such &s;uiters would have carried an harder point: nor indeed did the king want much &s;olicitation in his favour.</P>
<P>It happened that the &s;ees of Worce&s;ter and Sali&s;bury were at that time vacant by the deprivation of Ghinuccii, and Campegio, two Italian bi&s;hops, who fell under the king's di&s;|plea&s;ure upon his rupture with Rome. The former of the&s;e was offered to Mr. Latimer. As he had been at no pains to procure this promotion, he looked upon it as the work of providence, and accepted it without much
<PB N="59" REF="63">per&s;ua&s;ion. Indeed he had met with &s;o very rough a check already as a private clergy|man, and &s;aw before him &s;o hazardous a pro&s;pect in his old &s;tation, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary both for his own &s;afety, and for the &s;ake of being of more &s;ervice in the world, to &s;hroud him&s;elf under a little temporal power.</P>
<P>How he di&s;charged his new office may ea&s;ily be imagined. An hone&s;t con&s;cience, which was his rule of conduct in one &s;tation, might be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch in another. But we are not left to conjecture. All the hi&s;torians of the&s;e times, mention him as a per&s;on re|markably zealous in the di&s;charge of his duty. In overlooking the clergy of his dio|ce&s;e, which he thought the chief branch of the epi&s;copal office, exciting in them a zeal for religion, and obliging them at lea&s;t to a legal performance of their duty, he was un|commonly active, warm, and re&s;olute. With the &s;ame &s;pirit he pre&s;ided over his eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court; and either rooted out &s;uch crimes as were there cognizable, or prevent|ed their becoming exemplary, by forcing them into corners. In vi&s;iting he was fre|quent and ob&s;ervant; in ordaining &s;trict and wary; in preaching indefatigable; in re|proving and exhorting &s;evere and per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">Thus far he could act with authority: but in other things he found him&s;elf under diffi|culties. The ceremonies of the popi&s;h wor|&s;hip gave him great offence; and he neither dur&s;t, in times &s;o dangerous and un&s;ettled, lay them intirely a&s;ide; nor, on the other hand, was he willing intirely to retain them. In this dilemma his addre&s;s was admirable. He inquired into their origin; and when he found any of them, as &s;ome of them were, derived from a good meaning, he took care to inculcate the original meaning, though it|&s;elf a corruption, in the room of a more corrupt practice. Thus he put the people in mind, when holy bread and water were di|&s;tributed, that the&s;e elements which had long been thought endowed with a kind of magi|cal influence, were nothing more than ap|pendages to the two &s;acraments of the Lord's &s;upper, and bapti&s;m: the former, he &s;aid, reminded us of Chri&s;t's death, and the latter was only a &s;imple repre&s;entation of our being purified from &s;in. By thus reducing popery to its principles, he improved in &s;ome mea|&s;ure a bad &s;tock, by lopping from it a few fruitle&s;s excre&s;cences.</P>

<P>WHILE his endeavours to reform were thus confined within his own dioce&s;e, he was called upon to exert them in a more public manner; having received a &s;ummons to attend the parliament and convocation.</P>
<P>This &s;e&s;&s;ion, which was in the year 1536, was thought a cri&s;is by the prote&s;tant party. The renunciation of the pope's authority was a great &s;tep: a free inquiry into principles and practices, it was hoped, would follow; and a thorough reformation could not then, it was thought, be at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the papi&s;ts well knew the king's attachment to popery: and though they never imagined they &s;hould be able to clo&s;e up the breach, they were &s;anguine enough to believe they could ea&s;ily prevent its widening farther.</P>
<P>The&s;e oppo&s;ite hopes animated two power|ful parties; and indeed it is hard to &s;ay, whether the papi&s;ts or the prote&s;tants, during this reign, had the greater influence. Henry was governed intirely by his pa&s;&s;ions; and to the&s;e &s;ometimes one mini&s;ter, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="62" REF="66">another made the mo&s;t dextrous ad|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>At the head of the prote&s;tant party, was fir&s;t, the lord Cromwell, who&s;e favour with the king was now in its meridian; and who was the &s;oul of every thing that was done.</P>
<P>Next to him in power, was Cranmer arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury; to which dignity he had been promoted upon the death of War|ham, for his &s;ervices in the matter of the divorce. He was a &s;incere promoter of re|formation, and had abilities admirably adapt|ed to &s;uch a work. He was a calm, di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate man; had a &s;ound judgment, and a very exten&s;ive knowledge: but he had con|ver&s;ed little in the world; was very open to the attacks of malice and knavery, and was unacquainted with any methods but tho&s;e of gentlene&s;s and per&s;ua&s;ion, which indeed went a con&s;iderable way to promote his ends.</P>
<P>After him the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable man of the party; to whom were added the bi&s;hops of Ely, Ro|che&s;ter, Hereford, Sali&s;bury, and St. David's.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the popi&s;h party was headed by Lee, archbi&s;hop of York, Gar|diner,
<PB N="63" REF="67">Stoke&s;ly, and Tun&s;tal, bi&s;hops of Win|che&s;ter, London, and Durham.</P>
<P>Lee was con&s;iderable chiefly on account of the eminency of his &s;tation: Gardiner had the acute&s;t parts, Stoke&s;ley the mo&s;t zeal, and Tun&s;tal the be&s;t heart. But they were all a kind of court-barometers, and di&s;cern|ing men could judge of the temper of the times by their elevations and depre&s;&s;ions: yet Gardiner was a mo&s;t dextrous whi&s;perer, when he could get privately to his &s;overeign's ear; to which he had but too frequent ac|ce&s;s: though his abilities had not yet that &s;cope, which &s;ucceeding times allowed them.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;ons, thus di&s;po&s;ed, now met together in convocation. Their meeting was opened, in the u&s;ual form, by a &s;ermon, or rather an oration, &s;poken by the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, who&s;e eloquence was at this time every where famous. This ta&s;k was a&s;&s;igned him by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; who knew no man &s;o well qualified to lay before the clergy the corruptions of their order; and to rouze them, if po&s;&s;ible, into a &s;en&s;e of their duty. What he &s;aid, was to this effect.</P>
<P>"We are met together, it &s;eems, here, brethren, to con&s;ult the &s;ettlement of religion.
<PB N="64" REF="68">A very important tru&s;t is committed to us; and I hope each of us hath brought with him a re&s;olution to di&s;charge it properly. And, indeed, great need is there that &s;ome|thing &s;hould be done. Super&s;tition hath had a long reign among&s;t us; nor can I yet be|lieve its tyranny at an end, while I &s;ee our clergy &s;till immer&s;ed in the corruptions of their fore-fathers; while I &s;ee even mitred advocates, it becomes me to &s;peak plainly, &s;till e&s;pou&s;ing this cau&s;e. What an inunda|tion of folly, to give it the lighte&s;t appella|tion, is daily flowing from our pulpits? Is there an ab&s;urdity in the whole popi&s;h creed, is there a corruption in their whole ritual, which is not countenanced, even at this very day among&s;t us? Purgatory is &s;till believed; images are &s;till wor&s;hipped. And what is mo&s;t grievous, when external ob&s;ervances abound, men begin to lay a &s;tre&s;s upon them; and of cour&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of a good life is &s;uperceded.&mdash;Rouze your&s;elves, my bre|thren, rouze your&s;elves at the&s;e things. Con|&s;ider that an amendment of all the&s;e evils is looked for at our hands. If the prie&s;t is re|mi&s;s, what can be expected from the peo|ple? Imagine you hear, at the la&s;t day, the almighty Judge thus rebuking us. "A cry
<PB N="65" REF="69">again&s;t you cometh up into my ears; a cry again&s;t your avarice, your exactions, your tyranny. I commanded you with indu&s;try and pains-taking to feed my &s;heep: in&s;tead of which you do nothing but gluttonize from day to day, wallowing in indolence and plea&s;ure. I commanded you to preach my commandments, and &s;eek my glory: in&s;tead of which, you preach your own phanta&s;ies, and &s;eek your own profit. I commanded that all people &s;hould diligently &s;earch my word: in&s;tead of which, it is your care to &s;hut up the books of knowledge&mdash;Too much rea&s;on have you to fear, that reading the people may under&s;tand, and under&s;tand|ing they may learn to rebuke your &s;loth|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Since then, my brethren, the corruptions of the clergy are &s;o manife&s;t: and &s;ince &s;o &s;trict an account will be demanded of our conduct, let us at this time do &s;omething to &s;hew that we have the intere&s;t of religion at heart. Let us do &s;omething to wipe off prejudices, which I know have been con|ceived again&s;t &s;ome of us without-doors. And as our &s;tations in life add a dignity to our characters, &s;o let them in&s;pire us with
<PB N="66" REF="70">holine&s;s, and a zeal for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, in which alone con&s;i&s;ts the real dignity of a chri&s;tian bi&s;hop. All men know that we are here a&s;&s;embled, and with ardent looks expect the fruit of our con&s;ultation: Oh! my bre|thren, let us not di&s;appoint their hopes.</P>
<P>Lift up your heads therefore, my lords, look round, and examine what things want reformation in the church of England. Is it &s;o hard a matter to find out corruption and abu&s;es among us? What is done in the arches? Is there nothing there, that wants amendment? Is bu&s;ine&s;s &s;peedily di&s;patched? Or are &s;uiters intangled in forms, di&s;appointed, vexed, and rifled? Or if all things be well there, what think you of the bi&s;hops con|&s;i&s;tories? Is vice &s;ought out and corrected? or is it made a &s;hameful handle for bribery and extortion?</P>
<P>What think you, my brethren, of the ce|remonies of the church? Are they &s;imple and &s;ignificant? Or are they rather calcu|lated to offend weak con&s;ciences, and to en|courage &s;uper&s;tition among the vulgar?</P>
<P>Do you &s;ee nothing ami&s;s in that multipli|city of holidays, with which our calendar abounds? Is true religion, think you, more
<PB N="67" REF="71">promoted by them; or idlene&s;s and debau|chery?</P>
<P>What think you of images and relics, to which &s;o many painful pilgrimages are made from every corner of the kingdom? Do you ob&s;erve no prie&s;t-craft in the&s;e things, no gainful frauds, no profitable impo&s;itions?</P>
<P>What think you of our liturgy? Is it un|exceptionable in all its parts? or, if it was, is it defen&s;ible by &s;cripture that the offices of the church &s;hould be performed in an un|known tongue?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, my brethren, what think you of ma&s;&s;es, and of that beneficial commerce in this commodity, which has been carried on for &s;o many years?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the&s;e things, I beg of you, my lords, and if there be nothing to be correct|ed abroad, let each of us make one better. If there be nothing either abroad or at home that wants amendment, be chearful, my lords, and merry; and as we have nothing el&s;e to do, let us at lea&s;t rea&s;on the matter how we may grow richer: let us fall to &s;ome plea&s;ant conver&s;ation, and then go home with a full re&s;olution to live merrily here, for we have nothing to expect hereafter. Let us not &s;ay
<PB N="68" REF="72">with St. Peter, "Our end approacheth:" this is a melancholy note. But let us &s;ay with the evil &s;ervant, "My Lord delayeth his coming; and let us begin to beat our fellows, and eat and drink with the drunken." And what can be interpreted beating our fellows, if not allow|ing their corruptions? What can be interpret|ed eating and drinking with the drunken, if not &s;pending our lives in indolence and plea|&s;ure? But God will come on a day, when we look not for him; and in an hour, when we are not aware. He will call us to a &s;evere account, and all our worldly policy will end in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Let us then, my brethren, in time be wi&s;e: let us be wi&s;e, if not for others, at lea&s;t for our&s;elves. Let us wean our hearts from worldly things. Let us dive&s;t our&s;elves of each &s;elf-intere&s;ted thought; and let every man in this a&s;&s;embly re&s;olve to aim at no|thing in his coun&s;els, but the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of man."</P>
<P>With &s;uch language did the good bi&s;hop endeavour to work upon the a&s;&s;embly. But his &s;peech rather &s;hewed the goodne&s;s of his own heart, than wrought any change in the coun&s;els of his audience. For eloquence hath
<PB N="69" REF="73">&s;eldom influence but in que&s;tions of &s;udden determination.</P>
<P>The forms of their meeting were &s;carce &s;ettled, when the two parties began to at|tack each other with great bitterne&s;s. The papi&s;t was the aggre&s;&s;or. In the lower hou&s;e a bill was drawn up, the re&s;ult of much &s;e|cret caballing, which contained a catalogue of &s;ixty &s;even heretical opinions. Many of the&s;e were the tenets of Wicliffe: the re&s;t, of modern reformers. This bill was &s;ent up into the higher hou&s;e, where it met with many zealous advocates. Here it was agitat|ed with animo&s;ity enough on both &s;ides; each party re&s;olving in the fir&s;t conte&s;t, to make the other acquainted with its full &s;trength.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the debate which had now la&s;ted many days, each day growing warmer than the la&s;t, the lord Cromwell entered the hou&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the popi&s;h bi|&s;hops, required them in the king's name, to put an end to their oppo&s;ition. This me&s;&s;age in&s;tant|ly quenched the flame, and gave the reformers the fir&s;t intimation of the king's good inten|tions towards them.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74">Among other foreign prote&s;tants who were at this time entertained by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, there was a very ingenious Scot&s;man, who&s;e name was Ale&s;&s;e; a per&s;on, who had made him&s;elf very acceptable to the archbi&s;hop by his learning, and &s;olid judgment; and who was at all times, with|out any re&s;erve, con&s;ulted by the heads of the prote&s;tant party.</P>
<P>This learned man, Cromwell brought with him to the convocation-hou&s;e, where he &s;poke largely again&s;t the &s;acraments of the Roman church, and proved that two only were of go&s;pel in&s;titution. This &s;peech pro|duced a warm debate, and of long continu|ance, which was managed by the bi&s;hops of York and London, on the part of the pa|pi&s;ts; and of Canterbury and Hereford on that of the prote&s;tants; the latter retorting many things with great freedom again&s;t tra|dition and monkery, and the ignorance of the popi&s;h clergy.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult was, that four &s;acraments out of the &s;even were concluded to be in&s;igni|ficant.</P>
<P>But as the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter did not di|&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the debates of this con|vocation,
<PB N="71" REF="75">for debating was not his talent, it is be&s;ide my purpo&s;e to enter into a detail of the &s;everal tran&s;actions of it. I &s;hall only add, that an animated attempt was at this time made to get him and Cranmer &s;tigma|tized by &s;ome public cen&s;ure: but through their own and Cromwell's intere&s;t, they were too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to fear any open attack from their enemies.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t of what was now done, let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that no very ha&s;ty &s;teps were taken in favour of reformation: the cool heads, which managed that revolution, thought it &s;ufficient at this time to accu&s;tom the people to &s;ee religious matters brought into que&s;tion; and judged it more prudent, to loo&s;en prejudices by degrees, than to at|tempt, in a violent manner, to root them up.</P>
<P>When it was imagined, that the&s;e altera|tions were tolerably dige&s;ted, others, and the&s;e &s;till more &s;ubver&s;ive of popery, were, the &s;ame year, publi&s;hed in the king's name; the fir&s;t act of pure &s;upremacy, which this prince attempted. The articles, which con|tained the&s;e alterations, were drawn up, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, by the archbi&s;hop of
<PB N="72" REF="76">Canterbury; and if &s;o, it is more than pro|bable, that bi&s;hop Latimer had a hand in them. They were levelled chiefly again&s;t relics, images, pilgrimages, and &s;uperfluous holy-days.</P>
<P>In a few months after this, a &s;till more con&s;iderable advance was made. The Bible was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and recommend|ed to a general peru&s;al: the people were or|dered to be in&s;tructed in the principles of re|ligion in their mother-tongue; and the in|vocation of &s;aints was left as a thing in|different.</P>
<P>Thus reformation was daily gaining ground. The more glaring parts of the Romi&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition were now aboli&s;hed: a way was opened for free inquiry: men ventured to harbour doubts and &s;u&s;picions; and it was thought rational to bring the doctrines of the church to the te&s;t of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As for the papi&s;ts, they gave up every thing for lo&s;t. They had made their la&s;t effort by exciting the people to rebellion: exclaiming loudly again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries; which was indeed the mo&s;t unpopular act of tho&s;e times. But the flames which they had blown up, were now every where dying
<PB N="73" REF="77">away; the country enriched with the &s;poils of the prie&s;ts, grew plentiful and &s;atisfied; and men began to view the venerable ruins of an abbey, only as they contributed to enliven a land&s;cape.</P>
<P>In the mean while the bi&s;hop of Wor|ce&s;ter, highly &s;atisfied with the pro&s;pect of the times, repaired to his dioce&s;e; having made no longer &s;tay in London than was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He had no talents, and he knew that he had none, for &s;tate-affairs; and therefore he meddled not with them. The &s;ettlement of religion could not, he a&s;|&s;ured him&s;elf, be in abler hands, than in tho&s;e of the lord Cromwell: and while it was &s;o, he wi&s;ely judged it would be thought pre|&s;umption in him, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to know what men and times would bear, to concern him&s;elf with it. His talents were tho&s;e of a private &s;tation; and within that he was determined to confine them. If he be|haved in his dioce&s;e like a true chri&s;tian bi&s;hop, and did all in his power to root out &s;uper&s;tition, and encourage the practice of piety and virtue, he was &s;atisfied in his con|&s;cience, that he did all towards the &s;ettle|ment
<PB N="74" REF="78">of religion that could be expected from him. I make the&s;e remarks the rather, be|cau&s;e bi&s;hop Burnet &s;peaks in a very &s;light manner of his public character at this time; whereas it is certain, that he never de&s;ired to appear in any public character at all. His whole ambition was, to di&s;charge the pa&s;toral functions of a bi&s;hop, neither aiming to di&s;|play the abilities of the &s;tate&s;man, nor tho&s;e of the courtier. How very unqualified he was to &s;upport the latter of the&s;e characters, will &s;ufficiently appear from the following &s;tory.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom in tho&s;e days for the bi&s;hops, upon the coming in of the new year, to make pre&s;ents to the king: and ma|ny of them would pre&s;ent very liberally; pro|portioning their gifts to their expectances. Among the re&s;t, the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, be|ing at this time in town, waited upon the king with his offering: but, in&s;tead of a pur&s;e of gold, which was the common oblation, he pre&s;ented a New Te&s;tament, with a leaf doubled down, in a very con&s;picuous man|ner, to this pa&s;&s;age, "Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="79">The bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter being again &s;ettled in his dioce&s;e, went on, with his u&s;ual applica|tion, in the di&s;charge of his duty. But I meet with no particulars of his behaviour at this time, except only in one in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A gentleman of Warwick&s;hire, in a pur|cha&s;e, had done &s;ome hard things to a poor man in his neighbourhood: yet he had kept within the limits of the law; taking the ad|vantage of &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ion in a &s;tatute; having a brother, a ju&s;tice of peace, and enough acquainted with the law to do mi&s;chief, who had negotiated the affair for him. As the&s;e two brothers were men of great fortune in the country, and over-awed the neighbouring gentlemen, the poor man had nothing to do, but to &s;it quietly under his oppre&s;&s;ion. But while he was reconciling him&s;elf to what had happened, &s;ome of his friends put him upon applying, in the way of a complaint, to the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; who&s;e character, as the common patron of the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed, was every where much &s;poken of. The poor man approved the advice, and taking a journey to the bi&s;hop, acquainted him with the whole affair. The
<PB N="76" REF="80">bi&s;hop heard his &s;tory, pitied his ca&s;e, and &s;ent him home, with a promi&s;e of his pro|tection. Accordingly, he &s;oon after wrote to the ju&s;tice, who had been the chief agent in the affair, and endeavoured by proper argu|ments to rai&s;e in him a &s;en&s;e of the injury he had been guilty of: &s;peaking his mind very freely both of him, and his brother, yet treating them at the &s;ame time with proper civility. The two gentlemen were greatly in|cen&s;ed at this letter; and an&s;wered it in the &s;pirit of detected guilt: "They had done only what was right, and would abide by it: that as for the &s;ufferer, the law was open; and as for him, they could not but think he interfered very impertinently in an affair, which did not concern him." But in the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter they had not to do with a per&s;on, who was ea&s;ily &s;haken from an ho|ne&s;t purpo&s;e. He acquainted them in few words, "That if the cau&s;e of his complaint was not forthwith removed, he certainly would him&s;elf lay the whole affair before the king." And he had been, without doubt, as good as his word; but his adver&s;aries did not care to put him to a trial.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="81">Having now been about two years re&s;ident in his dioce&s;e, he was called up again to town in the year 1539, to attend the bu&s;ine&s;s of parliament: a parliament, which was pro|ductive of great events.&mdash; But as a new &s;pi|rit, had now infu&s;ed it&s;elf into the coun&s;els of tho&s;e times, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to trace it, from its fir&s;t efforts, into tho&s;e violent work|ings, and agitations, which it &s;oon produced.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>KING Henry VIII. made as little u&s;e of a good judgment, as any man ever did. He had no fixed principles; his whole reign was one continued rotation of violent pa&s;&s;ions: through the means of which &s;ecret &s;prings he was all his life a mere machine in the hands of his mini&s;ters; and he among them who could make the mo&s;t artful addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ion of the day, carried his point.</P>
<P>Gardiner was ju&s;t returned from Germany; having &s;ucce&s;sfully negotiated &s;ome commi&s;|&s;ions, which the king had greatly at heart. This introduced him with a good grace at court: where ob&s;erving, with his u&s;ual &s;aga|city, the temper and &s;ituation of men and things; and finding that room was left him to do mi&s;chief by the death of the queen, who exceedingly favoured the prote&s;tant in|tere&s;t, he collected every art he was ma&s;ter of; and with the &s;ubtilty of a bad &s;pirit, be&s;et the king, hoping, in &s;ome weak part, to infu&s;e his malice under the &s;emblance of &s;tate-policy.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="83">It was imagined by many at that time, and hath &s;ince that time been confirmed by cir|cum&s;tances, which came out afterwards, that Gardiner had begun thus early to entertain very ambitious de&s;igns, that he had been in treaty with the pope, and that for expected favours, he was under &s;ecret engagements with him to introduce popery again into England.</P>
<P>With this view, therefore, he took frequent occa&s;ions to alarm the king with apprehen|&s;ions of foreign and dome&s;tic danger. He would dwell upon the intrigues of the court of Rome, the power of the Emperor, the watchfulne&s;s of the Scots to take every ad|vantage; and above all, the &s;editious &s;pirit of his own &s;ubjects. He would then in&s;inuate, that &s;omething &s;hould be done in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e threathing dangers: and that, for his part, he knew nothing that could be more effectual, than for his maje&s;ty to &s;hew a zeal for the old religion. That, as for his throwing off the papal yoke, he &s;aid, it was a noble effort of his magnanimity; and was e&s;teemed &s;uch by all &s;ober men, for the ty|ranny of the court of Rome was become in|tolerable. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries was
<PB N="80" REF="84">likewi&s;e, in his opinion, wholly ju&s;tifiable; and his maje&s;ty well knew, that none of his coun&s;ellors had been more &s;anguine in that affair, than him&s;elf: but then he thought it was the part of wi&s;dom to con&s;ider the&s;e things only in a political light; and for him|&s;elf, he could not but greatly apprehend the bad con&s;equences of making any alterations in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. At lea&s;t, he would advi&s;e his maje&s;ty to &s;top where he was, and by &s;ome vigorous act to &s;hew the world, that he was not that patron of novel opinions, which he was generally e&s;teemed. By this means, he would make tho&s;e only his ene|mies, who were blind devotees to the papal power; and the&s;e were not one fourth part of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>By &s;uch infu&s;ions as the&s;e, which he knew very well how to dre&s;s into the form of argu|ments, and could render plau&s;ible by an art|ful di&s;play of the &s;ituation of Europe, and by &s;hewing how the intere&s;ts of courts and factions coincided intirely with his &s;chemes, the wily prelate &s;o wrought upon the fears, the ambition, or vanity of the king, for he could &s;hew his argument in all lights, that by degrees he drew attention, and at length
<PB N="81" REF="85">made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion, as he thought would &s;erve his purpo&s;e. Having gone thus far, he next began to propo&s;e expedients; and as the king was about to call a parliament at this time, to confirm and fini&s;h what he had done with relation to mona&s;teries, he per&s;uaded him to take this opportunity of doing &s;ome|thing in the bu&s;ine&s;s he had coun&s;elled. In the mean time, nothing of the&s;e de&s;igns tran|&s;pired; at lea&s;t, &s;o little, that the oppo&s;ite party could make no u&s;e of their intelligence; for of all the wicked mini&s;ters that have in|fe&s;ted the councils of princes, perhaps none was ever more deep and &s;ecret, than the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter.&mdash;This was the &s;tate of affairs, when the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter was called up to London, to attend the bu&s;ine&s;s of parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival in town, he was ac|cu&s;ed before the king of preaching a &s;editious &s;ermon. The &s;ermon was preached at court; and the preacher, according to his cu&s;tom, had been unque&s;tionably &s;evere enough again&s;t whatever he ob&s;erved ami&s;s. His accu&s;er, who is &s;aid to have been a per&s;on of great eminence about the king, was mo&s;t probably the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter: for this prelate
<PB N="82" REF="86">was known to make u&s;e of what arts he could to remove all tho&s;e from the national councils of tho&s;e times who were mo&s;t likely to thwart his mea&s;ures. The king had called together &s;everal of the bi&s;hops with a view to con&s;ult them upon &s;ome points of religion. When they had all given their opinions, and were about to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, if it was he, kneeled down before the king, and accu&s;ed the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter in the above-mentioned manner, &s;hewing how his &s;ermon, which he called a libel again&s;t the king and his mini&s;ters, tended to alienate the people from their prince. The bi&s;hop being called upon by the king, with &s;ome &s;ternne&s;s, to vindicate him&s;elf, was &s;o far from denying, or even palliating what he had &s;aid, that he boldly ju&s;tified it; and turning to the king with that noble unconcern which a good con|&s;cience in&s;pires, made this an&s;wer, "I never thought my&s;elf worthy, nor I never &s;ued to be a preacher before your grace; but I was called to it, and would be willing, if you mi&s;like me, to give place to my betters: for I grant there be a great many more worthy of the room than I am. And if it be your grace's plea&s;ure to allow them for preachers, I could be con|tent
<PB N="83" REF="87">to bear their books after them. But if your grace allow me for a preacher, I would de&s;ire you to give me leave to di&s;charge my con&s;cience, and to frame my doctrine accord|ing to my audience. I had been a very dolt indeed, to have preached &s;o at the borders of your realm, as I preach before your grace." The greatne&s;s of this an&s;wer baf|fled his accu&s;ers malice; the &s;everity of the king's countenance changed into a gracious &s;mile; and the bi&s;hop was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with that obliging freedom, which this monarch never u&s;ed, but to tho&s;e whom he e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>The parliament, which had been &s;ummon|ed to meet on the 28th of april, having now &s;at a week, and being ready to enter upon bu|&s;ine&s;s the lord chancellor, on the 5th of may, informed the lords from the king, that "his maje&s;ty had, with extreme unea&s;ine&s;s, ob|&s;erved the di&s;tracted condition of his &s;ubjects with regard to religion; that he had nothing &s;o much at heart, as to e&s;tabli&s;h an uniformity of opinion among&s;t them; and that he there|fore de&s;ired the lords would immediately ap|point a committee to examine the &s;everal opi|nions that prevailed, and to fix upon certain articles for a general agreement." It was the
<PB N="84" REF="88">manner, it &s;eems, of tho&s;e times, to u&s;e no ceremony in fixing a &s;tandard for men to think by; and to vary that &s;tandard with as little ceremony, as new modes of thinking prevailed. The parliament, therefore, with|out any difficulty, complied; and named for a committee, the lord Cromwell, the two archbi&s;hops, and the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter, Ely, Durham, Bath and Wells, Carli&s;le, and Bangor.</P>
<P>Men of &s;o oppo&s;ite a way of thinking, were not likely to agree. After eleven days there|fore &s;pent, in warm debates, nothing was con|cluded. This was no more than was expect|ed, and made room for the farce which fol|lowed.</P>
<P>On the twelfth day, the duke of Norfolk, according to the plan, which had been with|out doubt laid down, acquainted the lords, that "he found the committee had yet done nothing; that eleven days had been already &s;pent in wrangling, and that he &s;aw no po&s;&s;i|bility of coming to an agreement in that way. He begged leave, therefore, to offer to their lord&s;hips con&s;ideration, &s;ome articles which he him&s;elf had drawm up, and which he de&s;ired might be examined by a committee of the
<PB N="85" REF="89">whole hou&s;e." He then read the articles, which were the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the &s;acrament of the altar, after the con&s;ecration, there remained no &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine, but the natural body and blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. That vows of cha&s;tity ought to be ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the u&s;e of private ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be continued.</P>
<P N="4">4. That communion in both kinds was not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="5">5. That prie&s;ts might not marry.</P>
<P N="6">6. That auricular confe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be re|tained in the church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e articles was again&s;t the &s;acramentaries, as they were called, who de|nied tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. The &s;econd was de|&s;igned to keep the ejected clergy dependent on the pope; for Gardiner could not hope at this time to e&s;tabli&s;h them. The re&s;t were opinions of the greate&s;t weight in popery.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tant party began now plainly enough to &s;ee a concerted &s;cheme; and could trace it, without much difficulty, to its &s;ource. They re&s;olved, however to collect what &s;trength they were able, and at lea&s;t, to make
<PB N="86" REF="90">one &s;truggle. Each of them, therefore, did the utmo&s;t he could. But the noble &s;tand made by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury de|&s;erves particularly to be remembered. This prelate di&s;puted, in the military phra&s;e, every inch of ground; and with &s;uch force of rea|&s;on, that if rea&s;on had been his adver&s;aries weapon too, he had carried his point.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the fir&s;t article, indeed, he &s;aid no|thing; for at that time he held all the opinions of the Lutherans; among which, tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation was one. But again&s;t the &s;econd, he was extremely earne&s;t. It was very hard, he &s;aid, to force religious men from their hou&s;es, and not allow them that common intercour&s;e with the world, which the re&s;t of his maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects enjoyed: that the parliament had already ab&s;olved them from their vow of poverty; and he could &s;ee no rea&s;on why they &s;hould be ab&s;olved from one vow more than another: be&s;ides, he added, that, in his opinion, &s;uch a treatment of them was very impolitic; for while they continued in a &s;tate of coelibacy, they were &s;till in a capacity, if a fair occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, to re-enter their mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the third article, which enjoined the u&s;e of private ma&s;&s;es, he &s;aid it was a plain
<PB N="87" REF="91">condemnation of the king's proceedings again&s;t religious hou&s;es: for if ma&s;&s;es did benefit de|parted &s;ouls, it was &s;urely an unju&s;tifiable &s;tep to de&s;troy &s;o many noble foundations, which were dedicated to that only purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>With equal &s;pirit the archbi&s;hop oppo&s;ed the re&s;t of the articles; and like a wi&s;e &s;tate&s;|man, who knew the temper of the times, drew his arguments, when he could, from policy rather than religion. But all his elo|quence was ineffectual: the affair had been re&s;olved on in the cabinet; and the parliament was con&s;ulted only for form. The act there|fore pa&s;&s;ed without much oppo&s;ition; and was guarded with &s;uch penalties, as made it indeed ju&s;tly dreadful.</P>
<P>The act of the &s;ix articles, (for &s;o it was named) was no &s;ooner publi&s;hed, than it gave an univer&s;al alarm to all the favourers of refor|mation. The prote&s;tants every where cried out, "their pro&s;pect of happine&s;s was now over; they could not now expect a toleration: for they plainly &s;aw, that a &s;word was put into the hands of their enemies to de&s;troy them:" while both papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants joined in exclaiming, that, "it was difficult to &s;ay what the king intended: for it was neither &s;afe to
<PB N="88" REF="92">be of one profe&s;&s;ion nor the other: the act of &s;upremacy condemned the papi&s;t, and the act of the &s;ix articles, the prote&s;tant."</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter was among tho&s;e who fir&s;t took offence at the&s;e proceedings: and as he could not give his vote for the act, he thought it wrong to hold any office in a church, where &s;uch terms of communion were required. He re&s;igned his bi&s;hopric therefore, and retired into the country.</P>
<P>It is related of him, that when he came from the parliament hou&s;e to his lodgings, he threw off his robes, and leaping up, declared to tho&s;e who &s;tood about him, that, "he thought him&s;elf lighter, than ever he found him&s;elf before." The &s;tory is not unlikely, as it is much in character; a vein of plea&s;an|try and good-humour accompanying the mo&s;t &s;erious actions of his life.</P>
<P>In the mean time, vigilant emi&s;&s;aries were &s;ent abroad; articles of accu&s;ation were ga|thered up from all parts; and in London only, more than 500 per&s;ons, in a very &s;hort time, were impri&s;oned. Cromwell and Cranmer &s;aw with concern the mi&s;ery of the times, but could not prevent it: they &s;tood alone, and were be&s;ides enough engaged in &s;temming a
<PB N="89" REF="93">torrent, which ran &s;trong again&s;t them&s;elves. Cromwell, was almo&s;t borne down, though his enemies carried on their de&s;igns with great &s;ecre&s;y. As for Cranmer, more than one open attempt had been made again&s;t him; but his &s;overeign's favour &s;heltered him: and, indeed, king Henry's care for this excellent prelate, to the end of his reign, is almo&s;t the only &s;triking in&s;tance we have, either of his &s;teadine&s;s, or his good-nature.</P>
<P>During the heat of this per&s;ecution bi&s;hop Latimer re&s;ided in the country, where he thought of nothing, for the remainder of his days, but a &s;eque&s;tered life. He knew the &s;torm, which was up, could not &s;oon be ap|pea&s;ed; and he had no inclination to tru&s;t him&s;elf in it. But in the mid&s;t of his &s;ecurity, an unhappy accident carried him again into the tempe&s;tuous weather that was abroad. He received a brui&s;e by the fall of a tree, and the contu&s;ion was &s;o dangerous, that he was obliged to &s;eek out for better a&s;&s;i&s;tance than could be afforded him by the un&s;kilful &s;ur|geons of tho&s;e parts. With this view, he re|paired to London.</P>
<P>Here he found the pro&s;pect &s;till more glopmy: the popi&s;h party had now triumph|ed
<PB N="90" REF="94">over all their ob&s;tacles; and he had the mortification to &s;ee his great patron, the lord Cromwell, in the hands of his enemies.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;evere acts of that reign, the di&s;|&s;olution of mona&s;teries gave mo&s;t offence. The clamours of the expelled religious were &s;till loud and menacing; and the&s;e clamours were with great a&s;&s;iduity carried to the ears of the king, where they were repre&s;ented as the effects of a general &s;editious &s;pirit, capable of breaking out into any rebellious act. This indu&s;try in &s;hewing the king the odiou&s;ne&s;s of his government was u&s;ed to blacken Crom|well, who was the chief agent in the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of the religious hou&s;es; and had indeed been more in&s;trumental than any other man, in laying open the prie&s;tcraft, and detecting the impo&s;tures of the popi&s;h clergy, who were univer&s;ally incen&s;ed again&s;t him. The king li&s;tened with a cruel attention to the&s;e whi&s;pers again&s;t his mini&s;ter: and taking the hint, as it &s;hould &s;eem, from the Jewi&s;h law, he thought it no ill policy to make him the &s;cape-goat of his own offences.</P>
<P>Other cau&s;es, no doubt, con&s;pired in the ruin of this great patriot; and hi&s;torians gue&s;s at many: but the truth is, this affair, as well
<PB N="91" REF="95">as many others, which were directed by the dark coun&s;els of the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, are &s;till involved in the &s;ame ob&s;curity. It is cer|tain, however, that without even the form of a judicial trial, he was condemned to lo&s;e his head.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed this excellent &s;tate&s;man, than whom a greater man, perhaps, no times have produced. He had a high &s;en&s;e of public good; a noble, di&s;intere&s;ted, and generous heart. His parts were equal to any perplexity of government. Nor was his private cha|racter inferior to his public. He was pious and charitable in a great degree; humble, pa|tient of injury, and &s;uch an example of grati|titude as we &s;eldom meet with. His death was &s;uch a &s;tain upon the memory of tho&s;e times, that if there had been no other, it had been enough to mark them with infamy.</P>
<P>Upon Cromwell's fall, the per&s;ecution a|gain&s;t the prote&s;tants broke out in earne&s;t. The duke of Norfolk, and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who were the principal in&s;tru|ments in the rain of the late mini&s;ter, were now at the head of the popi&s;h party: and the authority of the former giving credit to the crafty coun&s;els of the latter, together they had
<PB N="92" REF="96">the management of all things in their hands. Under the direction of the&s;e zealots, the &s;word was pre&s;ently un&s;heathed; and &s;uch a &s;cene of blood was opened, as England had not yet &s;een.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer, among others, felt the lo&s;s of his great patron. Gardiner's emi&s;&s;aries &s;oon found him out in his concealment, for he was &s;till in London; and &s;omething that &s;omebody had &s;omewhere heard him &s;ay again&s;t the &s;ix articles being alledged again&s;t him, he was &s;ent to the tower. Into what particulars his accu|&s;ation was afterwards dige&s;ted, or whether into any, I meet with no account. It is ra|ther probable, that nothing formal was brought again&s;t him; for I do not find he was ever judicially examined. He &s;uffered, however, through one pretence or other, a cruel im|pri&s;onment during the remainder of king Henry's reign.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;pring of the year 1547, king Henry died; and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Ed|ward VI. This prince came a minor to the crown; and was left, by his father's will, in the hands of &s;ixteen governors. The&s;e were at fir&s;t equal in power, but dividing, as men commonly do in &s;uch circum&s;tances, into fac|tions, the earl of Hertford, &s;oon after created duke of Somer&s;et, being the king's uncle, was rai&s;ed above the re&s;t, with the title of Pro|tector of the kingdom. This revolution was matter of great joy to the prote&s;tant party; for the protector was generally known to be a favourer of reformation: He was be&s;ides a wi&s;e and an hone&s;t man; and his want of &s;pirit and re&s;olution was thought to be amply recompenced by his moderation and extreme popularity.</P>
<P>As for the young king, he is extolled in hi&s;tory as a miracle of human nature. But though we make allowances for the exagge|rated accounts of prote&s;tant writers, who&s;e gratitude may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have broken out
<PB N="94" REF="98">into high &s;trains of encomium, &s;uch an a&s;&s;em|blage of great and good qualities, will &s;till be left him, as have &s;eldom di&s;covered them|&s;elves in &s;o young a per&s;on, and much &s;el|domer in one, &s;ubject to the temptations of royalty. Among his other virtues, piety was con&s;picuous. With him the &s;ettlement of religion was an end; with his father it had been a mean. And as he had been bred up from his infancy, either among moderate men, or profe&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants, he had imbibed early prejudices in favour of the reformed doctrines. The protector, therefore, found no ob&s;tacle in his de&s;igns from the young king.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tant intere&s;t was &s;till farther &s;trengthened by the addition of archbi&s;hop Cranmer's coun&s;els; which had now all that weight which the protector's authority could give them.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Gardiner, Tun&s;tal, and Bonner, who was now bi&s;hop of London, &s;et them&s;elves at the head of the popi&s;h party, and oppo&s;ed the protector as much as they dur&s;t: not indeed openly and directly; for they pre&s;ently ob&s;erved the turning of the wind, and had &s;hifted their &s;ails with great nimblene&s;s; but thwarting the means rather
<PB N="95" REF="99">than the mea&s;ures, they oppo&s;ed him, with that plau&s;ible di&s;&s;imulation, which men, dex|trous in bu&s;ine&s;s, can ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ume. Their common language was, that, "however ne|ce&s;&s;ary the&s;e alterations were, they were cer|tainly at this time highly improper &mdash; that a minority was not a &s;ea&s;on for innovations&mdash;that it was enough to keep things quiet, till the king came of age, and that abu&s;es might then be inquired into, and remedies applied, with all that authority, which the full regal power could give."</P>
<P>Their oppo&s;ition, however, had little effect; and many changes in religion were projected, and &s;ome carried into execution, with as much di&s;patch as affairs of &s;uch importance would admit. The act of the &s;ix articles was repeal|ed, images were removed out of churches; the liturgy was amended; and all mini&s;ters were confined to their pari&s;h-churches. This la&s;t was an excellent means to prevent the &s;pread|ing both of popery and &s;edition: while &s;pe|cial licences were granted to approved men to preach where they plea&s;ed. And what recom|mended the&s;e changes to &s;ober men of all di|&s;tinctions, was, the great moderation, and &s;pirit of candour which accompanied them through|out.
<PB N="96" REF="100">Two acts of blood indeed &s;tand upon record: almo&s;t &s;hameful and indelible &s;tain upon the annals of that admini&s;tration!</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ection, we left Mr. Latimer in the tower, where he had now lived above &s;ix years, in the con&s;tant practice of every chri&s;tian virtue, that becomes a &s;uffer|ing &s;tate. Immediately, upon the change of the government, he, and all others who were impri&s;oned in the &s;ame cau&s;e, were &s;et at li|berty: and bi&s;hop Latimer, who&s;e old friends were now in power, was received by them, with every mark of affection.</P>
<P>Heath, who had &s;ucceeded him in the bi&s;hopric of Worce&s;ter, ob&s;erving his credit at court, and fearing le&s;t it &s;hould be thought proper to re-in&s;tate him, was in a great di|lemma, how to conduct him&s;elf. As he was a man of no principle, he had only to ob&s;erve the temper of the times, and to manage ac|cordingly. But unhappily he was as bad a courtier as a bi&s;hop. Making fal&s;e judgments therefore, and being drawn in by artful men, he applied to the papi&s;ts, in&s;tead of the pro|te&s;tants. His party, and his folly, for he was in every re&s;pect an in&s;ignificant man, laid him &s;o exceedingly open, that Mr. Latimer would
<PB N="97" REF="101">have found no difficulty in di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him. But he had other &s;entiments: age coming upon him, he thought him&s;elf now unequal to the weight of a bi&s;hopric, and had no in|clination to incumber him&s;elf with one. Perhaps too, he might think there was &s;ome|thing of hard&s;hip and inju&s;tice in the ca&s;e. Whatever were his rea&s;ons, it is certain he would make no &s;uit him&s;elf, nor &s;uffer his friends to make any, for his re&s;toration.</P>
<P>But the parliament, which was now &s;itting, having &s;ettled every thing of national concern, and applying it&s;elf to private bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ent up an addre&s;s to the protector, begging him to re&s;tore Mr. Latimer to the bi&s;hopric of Wor|ce&s;ter. The protector was very well inclined to gratify the commons, and propo&s;ed the re|&s;umption of his bi&s;hopric to Mr. Latimer, as a point he had very much at heart: but the other per&s;evered in his negative, alledging his great age, and the claim he had from thence to a private life.</P>
<P>The report of the parliament's interpo&s;ition reaching Heath's ears, terrified him to &s;uch a degree, that, taking it for granted his popery had been complained of, be immediately de|&s;erted his party, and became an orthodox pro|te&s;tant.
<PB N="98" REF="102">And thus &s;hewing a con&s;cientious regard for neither, he became contemptible to both parties.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer having rid him&s;elf intirely of all intreaty on this head, accepted an invita|tion from his friend archbi&s;hop Cranmer, and took up his re&s;idence at Lambeth; where he led a very retired life. I call it retired, be|cau&s;e he &s;aw little company, and never in|terfered in public affairs: though he had always as crouded a levee as a mini&s;ter of &s;tate. His chief employment was to hear the complaints, and to redre&s;s the injuries of poor people: and his character, for &s;ervices of this kind, was &s;o univer&s;ally known, that &s;trangers, from every part of England, would re&s;ort to him, vexed either by the delays of public courts and offices, which were &s;urely at that time exceedingly out of order; or hara&s;&s;ed by the oppre&s;&s;ions of the great. "I cannot go to my book, (&s;ays he, giving an account of the&s;e avocations) for poor folks that come unto me, de&s;iring that I will &s;peak, that their matters may be heard. Now and then I walk in my lord of Canterbury's garden, looking in my book: but I can do but little good at it; for I am no &s;ooner in the garden, and have
<PB N="99" REF="103">read a little while, but by and by cometh &s;ome one or other knocking at the gate. Anon, cometh my man, and &s;aith, Sir, there is one at the gate would &s;peak with you. When I come there, then it is &s;ome one or other that de&s;ireth me that I will &s;peak, that his matter may be heard; or that telleth me he hath lain this long time at great co&s;ts and charges, or that he cannot once have his matter come to an hearing."</P>
<P>And &s;ure, no one was better qualified to undertake the office of redre&s;&s;ing injuries: for his free reproofs, joined to the integrity of his life, had a great effect upon tho&s;e in the high|e&s;t &s;tations; while his own independence, and backwardne&s;s in a&s;king any favour for him|&s;elf, allowed him greater liberty in a&s;king for others.</P>
<P>In the&s;e employments he &s;pent more than two years; interfering as little as po&s;&s;ible, dur|ing that whole time, in any public tran&s;action: though no doubt, if he had plea&s;ed, he might have had great weight, at lea&s;t in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. But be&s;ides the di&s;tru&s;t he had of his own judgment, he was a man of &s;uch exact|ne&s;s in his principles and practice, that he could &s;carce have made tho&s;e allowances for men
<PB N="100" REF="104">and mea&s;ures, which prudent coun&s;ellors mu&s;t make in corrupt times; and was backward therefore in drawing upon him&s;elf &s;uch en|gagements, as might lead him, more or le&s;s, in|to a deviation from truth. I find him, how|ever, at this time engaged in a&s;&s;i&s;ting arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer to compo&s;e the homilies, which were &s;et forth by authority, in the fir&s;t year of king Edward. A u&s;eful work this was; intended to &s;upply the want of preach|ing, which was now at a very low ebb.</P>
<P>The clergy of the old per&s;ua&s;ion cho&s;e to have them&s;elves con&s;idered as a &s;ort of factors, who were to tran&s;act the &s;piritual bu&s;ine&s;s of the people: while the people, in the mean time, having paid their agents, had no further concern about their &s;alvation. Thus religion was turned into a trade; and the prie&s;ts having gotten the monopoly of it, maintained them|&s;elves in this monopoly by their preaching, in which they propo&s;ed no other end. Church-endowments, private ma&s;&s;es, and &s;uch gainful topics were in&s;i&s;ted on; and the&s;e things &s;u|per&s;eded faith and good morals.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al corruption in the prie&s;thood, was a melancholy pro&s;pect to all, who wi&s;hed well to reformation: and it was the more
<PB N="101" REF="105">melancholy, as it was an evil which could not in many years admit a cure. What &s;eemed be&s;t, however, was to keep the clergy, as much as po&s;&s;ible, out of the pulpits; and to this end the book of homilies was compo&s;ed, and put into the hands of all mini&s;ters of pari&s;hes, who were injoined by authority to read one every &s;unday, in&s;tead of preaching. In the&s;e homilies, the people were &s;hewn the in&s;ig|nificance of outward ob&s;ervances, and were taught to believe that their &s;alvation depend|ed upon them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Have had frequent occa&s;ion to mention Mr. Latimer as a preacher; as indeed he was of the mo&s;t eloquent and po|pular of the age, in which he lived; but at this time he appeared in that character in a more advantageous light than he had yet done; having been appointed, during the three fir&s;t years of king Edward, to preach the lent &s;ermons before the king. The choice of &s;uch a preacher was approved by all good men: great irregularities were known to pre|vail; and Mr. Latimer was acknowledged to be as fit a man as any in the nation to detect and cen&s;ure them.</P>
<P>The court of king Edward VI, and indeed the whole frame of his government, was in as great di&s;order as almo&s;t any court or any go|vernment could be, in the wor&s;t of times. The example of the young king was noble and in&s;tructive, and would by degrees, no doubt, have had its influence; but as he was now only a boy, and in the hands of others, he had little weight. Nor was the protector a man qualified to curb licentious &s;pirits. He
<PB N="103" REF="107">was of an ea&s;y nature, and though he wi&s;hed to &s;ee things in order, yet he could contribute little more than a good example to keep them &s;o. As the principal &s;prings were thus weak, it is no wonder if the inferior movements were irregular. A minority was thought the &s;ea&s;on for every one to make his claim; and &s;uch claims were made by all who had any preten&s;ions to court-favours, as equally &s;ur|pri&s;ed and &s;candalized all &s;ober ob&s;ervers. The &s;poils of an hundred and &s;ixty mona&s;te|ries, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying, had increa&s;ed the avarice of the courtiers. Having already pruned away all the &s;uperfluous parts, and much &s;uperfluity there was, from the re|venues of the church, they began now to lop off tho&s;e vital branches, which were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport. In&s;omuch, that there was &s;carce a benefice in the nation of any con|&s;iderable value, on which &s;ome greedy courtier was not pen&s;ioned. To this in&s;atiable avarice was added a licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners, be|yond the example of former times.</P>
<P>A court thus corrupt, produced its nece&s;&s;a|ry con&s;equence, corruption in every order of the &s;tate. Never was ju&s;tice wor&s;e admini|&s;tered: never were the di&s;pen&s;ers of it more
<PB N="104" REF="108">venal. The public offices too were equally corrupt, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the revenue, where mo&s;t &s;candalous depredations were made. Nor did the country retain its innocence. Here the gentry practi&s;ed tho&s;e arts of avarice and rapine which they had learned at court, and taught the people all tho&s;e vices, to which indigence gives birth, While the clergy, in|&s;tead of qualifying in &s;ome degree this cor|rupt ma&s;s, by a mixture of piety and devo|tion, incorporated with it, and even increa&s;ed its malignity by an addition of as bad, if not of wor&s;e ingredients.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of practical religion in the nation, when Mr. Latimer was called to the office of a court-preacher. As to his &s;er|mons, which are &s;till extant, they are far from being exact pieces of compo&s;ition. Elegant writing was then little known. Some polite &s;cholars there were, Cheek, A&s;cham, and a few others, who, from an acquaintance with cla&s;&s;ical learning, of which they were the re|&s;torers, began to think in a new manner, and could treat a &s;ubject with accuracy at lea&s;t, if not with elegance. But in general, the writers of that age, and e&s;pecially the church-men, were equally incorrect in their compo&s;ition, and &s;lovenly in their language. We mu&s;t not,
<PB N="105" REF="109">therefore, expect that Mr. Latimer's di&s;cour&s;es will &s;tand a critical inquiry: they are at be&s;t loo&s;e, incoherent pieces: yet his &s;implici|ty, and low familiarity, his humour, and gibing drollery, were well adapted to the times; and his oratory, according to the mode of elo|quence at that day, was exceeding popular. His manner of preaching too was very affect|ing: and no wonder; for he &s;poke imme|diately from his heart.</P>
<P>His abilities, however, as an orator, made only the inferior part of his character as a preacher. What particularly recommends him is, that noble and apo&s;tolic zeal, which he exerts in the cau&s;e of truth. And &s;ure no one had an higher &s;en&s;e of what became his office; was le&s;s influenced by any &s;ini&s;ter mo|tive, or dur&s;t with more freedom reprove vice, however dignified by worldly di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>It is in this light then, in which I would particularly recommend him; and &s;hall there|fore, in the following pages, give the reader &s;ome in&s;tances, in his own words, of that &s;pi|rit, with which he la&s;hed the courtly vices of his time.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t &s;ermon, which is addre&s;&s;ed chiefly to the king, he opens his commi&s;&s;ion: "The preacher, &s;ays he, cannot correct the king, if
<PB N="106" REF="110">he be a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, with the temporal &s;word, but with the &s;piritual; fearing no man, &s;et|ting God only before his eyes, under whom he is a mini&s;ter to root up vice. Let the preacher therefore, never fear to declare the me&s;&s;age of God. And if the king will not hear, then let the preacher admoni&s;h him, pray for him, and &s;o leave him unto God." He then pro|ceeds to point out to the king his duty, in &s;e|veral in&s;tances.</P>
<P>In his &s;econd &s;ermon, he la&s;hes the clergy. "It is a marvel, &s;ays he, if any mi&s;chief be in hand, if a prie&s;t be not at one end of it. &mdash; I will be a &s;uitor to your grace, to give your bi&s;hops charge ere they go home, upon their allegiance to look better to their flock. And if they be found negligent, out with them: I require it in God's behalf, make them quon|dams, all the pack of them; your maje&s;ty hath divers of your chaplains, well learned men, and of good knowledge, to put in their place: and yet you have &s;ome that are bad enough, hangers on of the court, I mean not the&s;e. But if your maje&s;ty's chaplains, and my lord protector's, be not able to furni&s;h their places, there is in this realm, thanks be to God, a great &s;ight of laymen, well-learned in the
<PB N="107" REF="111">&s;criptures, and of a virtuous and godly con|ver&s;tion, better learned than a great &s;ight of us the clergy. This I move of con&s;cience to your grace. And let them not only do the function of bi&s;hops, but live of the &s;ame: and not, as in many places, that one &s;hould have the name, and another the profit. What an enormity is this, for a man to &s;erve in a civility, and have the profit of a provo&s;t&s;hip, and a deanery, and a par&s;onage. But I will tell you what is like to come of it: it will bring the clergy &s;hortly into very &s;lavery.&mdash;But I fear one thing, that for &s;aving a little money, you will put chantry-prie&s;ts into be|nefices. Chri&s;t bought &s;ouls with his blood; and will you &s;ell them for gold arid &s;ilver? I would not have you do with chantry-prie&s;ts, as was done with abbots. For when their enormities were fir&s;t read in the parliament, they were &s;o abominable, that there was no|thing but, Down with them: but within a while after, the &s;ame abbots were made bi&s;hops, as there be &s;ome of them yet alive, to &s;ave their pen&s;ions. O Lord! think you that God is a fool, and &s;eeth it not?"</P>
<P>Afterwards, warning the king again&s;t flat|terers, he tells him that God &s;ays, If the king
<PB N="108" REF="112">&s;hall do his will, he &s;hall reign long, he and his children. "Wherefore, &s;ays he, I would have your grace remember this, and when any of the&s;e flatterers, and flibber-gibbers another day &s;hall come, and claw you by the back, and &s;ay, Sir, trouble not your&s;elf: what &s;hould you &s;tudy for? why &s;hould you do this or that? your grace may an&s;wer them thus, What, &s;irrah? I perceive you are weary of us. Doth not God &s;ay in &s;uch a place, that a king &s;hould fear God, that he may reign long? I perceive now, that thou art a traytor. Tell him this tale once, and I warrant you he will come no more to you."</P>
<P>He then &s;peaks of the delay of ju&s;tice, and the abu&s;es in the law. "I hear of many mat|ters, &s;ays he, before my lord protector, and my lord chancellor, that cannot be heard. I mu&s;t de&s;ire my lord protector's grace to hear me in this matter; and that your grace would likewi&s;e hear poor mens &s;uits your&s;elf. Put them to none other to be heard: let them not be delayed. The &s;aying is now, that money is heard every where: if a man be rich, he &s;hall &s;oon have an end of his matter. Others are fain to go home with tears, for any help they can obtain at any judge's hand. Hear mens &s;uits
<PB N="109" REF="113">your&s;elf, I require you, in God's behalf; and put them not to the hearing of the&s;e velvet-coats, and up&s;kips. Now a man can &s;carce know them from ancient knights of the coun|try.&mdash;A gentlewoman came to me, and told me, that a certain great man keepeth &s;ome lands of hers from her; and that in a whole year &s;he could but get one day for the hear|ing of her matter; and on that day the great man brought on his &s;ide, a &s;ight of lawyers for his coun&s;el, and that &s;he had but one man of the law; and the great man &s;o &s;hakes him, that he cannot tell what to do; &s;o that when the matter came to the point, the judge was a mean to the gentlewoman, that &s;he would let the great man have a quietne&s;s in her land. I be&s;eech your grace, that you will look to the&s;e matters. Hear them your&s;elf. View your judges; and hear poor mens cau&s;es. And you, proud judges, hearken what God &s;aith in his holy book: Hear the poor, &s;aith he, as well as the rich. Mark that &s;aying, thou proud judge. The devil will bring this &s;entence at the day of doom. Hell will be full of &s;uch judges, if they repent not and amend. They are wor&s;e than the wick|ed judge, Chri&s;t &s;peaketh of: for they will
<PB N="110" REF="114">neither hear men for God's &s;ake, nor fear of the world, nor importunity, nor any thing el&s;e. Yea, &s;ome of them will command them to ward, if they be importunate. I heard &s;ay, that when a &s;uitor came to one of them, he &s;aid, What fellow is it that giveth the&s;e folks coun&s;el to be &s;o importunate? He &s;hould be committed to ward. Marry, Sir, com|mit me then: it is even I that gave them that coun&s;el. And if you amend not, I will cau&s;e them to cry out upon you &s;till, even as long as I live."</P>
<P>In this third &s;ermon he la&s;hes the judges again. "Now-a-days, &s;ays he, the judges are afraid to hear a poor man again&s;t the rich: they will either pronounce again&s;t him, or drive off the &s;uit, that he &s;hall not be able to go through with it. But the greate&s;t man in the realm cannot &s;o hurt a judge as a poor widow; &s;uch a &s;hrewd turn can &s;he do him. The cries of the poor a&s;cend to heaven, and call down vengeance from God. &mdash; Cambi&s;es was a great emperor, &s;uch another as our ma&s;ter is: he had many lord pre&s;idents, lord deputies, and lieutenants under him. It chanc|ed he had under him, in one of his domini|ons, a briber, a gift-taker, a gratifier of rich men. The cry of a poor widow came to
<PB N="111" REF="115">the emperor's ears; upon which be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">layed the judge quick, and laid his &s;kin in the chair of judgment; that all judges, that &s;hould give judgment afterwards &s;hould &s;it in the &s;ame &s;kin. Surely it was a goodly &s;ign, the &s;ign of the judge's &s;kin: I pray God, we may once &s;ee the &s;ign of the &s;kin in England."</P>
<P>Before he concludes, he &s;peaks of the pro|gre&s;s of the reformation. "It was yet, he &s;aid, but a mingle-mangle, and a hotch-potch: I cannot tell what, &s;ays he, partly popery, and partly true religion mingled together. They &s;ay in my country, when they call their hogs to the &s;wine-trough, Come to thy mingle-mangle, come pur, come. Even &s;o do they make mingle-mangle of the go&s;pel. They can clatter and prate of it, but when all com|eth to all, they joined popery &s;o with it, that they marred all together." &mdash; In this &s;er|mon too he inveighs again&s;t deba&s;ing the coin, and &s;hews the bad con&s;equences of it. The pa&s;&s;age is quoted at length by Mr. Folkes, in his treati&s;e upon Engli&s;h coins.</P>
<P>In his fourth &s;ermon, he again taxes the bi&s;hops. "Thou &s;halt not, &s;ays he, addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to the king, be partaker of other mens &s;ins. So &s;aith St. Paul. And what is
<PB N="112" REF="116">it to be a partaker of other mens &s;ins, if it be not &s;o, to make unpreaching prelates, and to &s;uffer them to continue &s;till in their un|preaching prelacy. If the king &s;hould &s;uffer the&s;e things, and look through his fingers, and wink at them, &s;hould not the king be a par|taker of other mens &s;ins? And why? Is he not &s;upreme head of the church? What? Is the &s;upremacy a dignity, and nothing el&s;e? Is it not accountable? I think verily it will be a chargeable dignity, when account &s;hall be a&s;ked of it. &mdash; If the &s;alt is un&s;avoury, it is good for nothing. By this &s;alt is under&s;tood preachers. And if it is good for nothing, it &s;hould be ca&s;t out. Out with them then, ca&s;t them out of their office. What &s;hould they do with cures, that will not look to them?&mdash;Oh that a man might have the con|templation of hell; that the devil would al|low a man to look into it, and &s;ee its &s;tate, as he &s;hewed all the world, when he tempt|ed Chri&s;t in the wilderne&s;s. On yonder &s;ide, would the devil &s;ay, are puni&s;hed unpreaching prelates. I think verily a man might &s;ee as far as a kenning, as far as from Calais to Dover I warrant you, and &s;ee nothing but unpreach|ing prelates.&mdash;As for them, I never look to
<PB N="113" REF="117">have their good words as long as I live. Yet will I &s;peak of their wickedne&s;s, as long as I &s;hall be permitted to &s;peak. No preacher can pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence. It is the original root of all mi&s;chief. As for me, I owe them no other ill-will, but to pray God to amend them. I would have them do their duty. I owe them no other malice than this, and this is none at all."</P>
<P>In his fifth &s;ermon he again la&s;hes the judges, and patrons of livings. "If a judge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ys he, &s;hould ask me the way to hell, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">uld &s;hew him this way: fir&s;t let him be covetous man; then let him go a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rther, and take bribes, and la&s;tly, let him pervert judgment. Lo, here is the mother, and the daughter, and the daughter's daugh|ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Avarice is the mother; &s;he brings i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bribe-taking, and bribe-taking pervert|ing of judgment. There lacks a fourth thing to make up the me&s;s, which, &s;o God help <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, if I were judge, &s;hould be a Tyburn tippit. Were it the judge of the king's-bench, my lord chief judge of England, yea, were it my lord chancellor him&s;elf, to Tyburn with him.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one will &s;ay, peradventure, you &s;peak un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">mly &s;o to be again&s;t the officers, for taking
<PB N="114" REF="118">of rewards: you con&s;ider not the matter to the bottom. Their offices be bought for great &s;ums: now how &s;hould they receive their money again, but by bribing? you would not have them undone. Some of them give two hundred pounds, &s;ome five hun|dred, &s;ome two thou&s;and; and how can they gather up this money again, but by helping them&s;elves in their office?&mdash;And is it &s;o, trow ye? Are civil offices bought for money? Lord God! who would have thought it it! Oh! that your grace would &s;eek through your realm for men, meet for offices, yea, and give them liberally for their pains, rather than that they &s;hould give money for them. This buying of offices is a making of bribery: for he that buyeth, mu&s;t needs &s;ell. You &s;hould &s;eek out for offices wi&s;e men, and men of activity, that have &s;tomachs to do their bu&s;ine&s;s; not milk-&s;ops, nor white-livered knights; but fearers of God: for he that feareth God, will be no briber.&mdash;But perhaps you will &s;ay, we touch no bribes. No, marry; but my mi&s;tre&s;s, your wife, hath a fine finger; &s;he toucheth it for you; or el&s;e you have a &s;ervant, who will &s;ay, if you will offer my ma&s;ter a yoke of oxen, you will fare never
<PB N="115" REF="119">the wor&s;e: but I think my ma&s;ter will not take them: When he has offered them to the ma&s;ter, then comes another &s;ervant, and &s;ays, if you will carry them to the clerk of the kitchen, you will be remembered the bet|ter. This is a frierly fa&s;hion: they will re|ceive no money in their hands, but will have it put upon their &s;leeves."</P>
<P>Speaking of venal patrons, he cries but, "O Lord, in what ca&s;e are we! I marvel the ground gapes not, and devours us. Surely, if they u&s;ed their religion &s;o in Turkey, the Turk u&s;ed not to &s;uffer it in his common|wealth. Patrons are charged to &s;ee the office done, not to get lucre by his patron&s;hip. There was a patron in England, that had a benefice fallen into his hand, and a good brother of mine came unto him, and brought him thirty apples in a di&s;h, which he gave to his man to carry to his ma&s;ter. Having pre&s;ented them, he &s;aid, Sir, &s;uch a man hath &s;ent you a di&s;h of fruit, and de&s;ireth yon to be good to him for &s;uch a benefice. Tu&s;h, quoth he, this is no apple matter; I will have hone of his ap|ples: I have as good as the&s;e in my own orchard. The man came to the prie&s;t again, and told him what his ma&s;ter &s;aid.
<PB N="116" REF="120">Then, quoth the prie&s;t, de&s;ire but to prove one of them for my &s;ake: he &s;hall find them better than they look for. Upon this, he cut one of them, and found ten pieces of gold in it. Marry, quoth he, this is a good apple. The prie&s;t &s;tanding not far off, hearing what the gentleman &s;aid, cried out, they all grow on one tree, I warrant you, Sir, and have all one ta&s;te. Well, this is a good fellow; let him have the benefice, quoth the patron. Get you but a graft of this tree, and it will &s;erve you in better &s;tead, I warrant you, than all St. Paul's learning. But let patrons take heed; for they &s;hall an&s;wer for all the &s;ouls that peri&s;h through their default; and yet this is taken for a laughing matter.&mdash;I de&s;ire your maje&s;ty to remedy the&s;e matters; and &s;ee re|dre&s;s in this realm in your own per&s;on. Al|though, my lord protector, I doubt not, and the re&s;t of the council do, in the mean time, all that lieth in their power to redre&s;s things."</P>
<P>He begins his &s;ixth &s;ermon with taxing the fa&s;hionable vices of the age. He begins with duelling, and exclaims again&s;t the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the law in puni&s;hing it. "I do not know, &s;ays he, what you call chance-medley in the law: the law is not my &s;tudy. I am a &s;cho|lar
<PB N="117" REF="121">in &s;cripture, in God's book: I &s;tudy that; and I know what is murder in the &s;ight of God. I fall out with a man; he is angry with me, and I with him; and lacking op|portunity and place, we put it off for that time. In the mean &s;ea&s;on I prepare my weapon, and &s;harp it again&s;t another time. I &s;well and boil in my mind again&s;t my adver|&s;ary: I &s;eek him; we meddle together; it is my chance, by rea&s;on my weapon is better than his, and &s;o forth, to kill him: I give him his death &s;troke in my vengeance. This I call voluntary murder from &s;cripture: what it is in the law I cannot tell.&mdash;A &s;earcher in London, executing his office, di&s;plea&s;ed a mer|chant. They had words, and the merchant kills him. They that told me this tale, &s;ay, it is winked at: they look through their fin|gers, and will not &s;ee it. Whether it is taken up with a pardon or not, I know not; but this I am &s;ure of, that if you bear with &s;uch matters, the devil will bear you away to hell. &mdash; O Lord! what whoredom is u&s;ed now-a-days! It is marvel that the earth gapeth not, and &s;walloweth us up. God hath &s;uffered long of his great mercy; but he will puni&s;h &s;harply at length, if we do not repent.&mdash;There
<PB N="118" REF="122">are &s;uch dicing-hou&s;es al&s;o, they &s;ay, as have not been wont to be; where young gentlemen dice away their thrift, and where dicing is, there are other follies al&s;o. For the love of God let remedy be had. Men of England, in time pa&s;t, when they would ex|erci&s;e them&s;elves, were wont to go abroad in the fields a &s;hooting. The art of &s;hooting hath been in times pa&s;t much e&s;teemed in the realm, in which we excel all other na|tions. In my time, my poor father was as diligent to teach me to &s;hoot, as to learn me any other thing; and so I think other men did their children. He taught me how to, draw, how to lay my body in my bow, and to draw not with &s;trength of arm, as other na|tions do, but with &s;trength of body. But now we have taken up whoring in towns, in&s;tead of &s;hooting in fields. I de&s;ire you, my lords, even as you have the honour of God at heart, and intend to remove his indignation, let there be &s;ent forth &s;ome proclamation, &s;ome &s;harp proclamation, to the ju&s;tices of peace; for they do not their duty. Ju&s;tices now be no ju&s;tices."&mdash;In the following part of his di&s;|cour&s;es he ridicules an argument for the pope's &s;upremacy, made u&s;e of by cardinal Pool, in
<PB N="119" REF="123">his book again&s;t king Henry. "Je&s;us cometh, &s;aith he, to Simon's boat: now come the papi&s;ts, and they will make a my&s;tery of it: they will pick out the &s;upremacy of the bi&s;hop of Rome in Peter's boat. We may make alle|gories enough of every part of &s;cripture; but &s;urely, it mu&s;t needs be a &s;imple matter, that &s;tandeth on &s;o weak a ground. If you a&s;k, why to Simon's boat, rather than to any other? I will an&s;wer, as I find by experience in my|&s;elf, I came hither to-day from Lambeth in a wherry, and when I came to take my boat, the watermen came about me, as the manner is, and he would have me, and he would have me. I took one of them. Now you will a&s;k me, why I came in that boat rather than any other? Why, becau&s;e it was next me, and &s;tood more commodiou&s;ly for me. And &s;o did Chri&s;t by Simon's boat: it &s;tood nearer to him, or mayhap he &s;aw a better &s;eat in it.&mdash;It follow|eth in the text, that he taught &s;itting. Preach|ers, belike, were &s;itters in tho&s;e days. I would our preachers would preach either &s;it|ting or &s;tanding.&mdash; The text doth not tell us what he taught. If I were a papi&s;t now, I could tell you what he &s;aid; as pope Nicho|las and bi&s;hop Lanfrank did, who tell us that
<PB N="120" REF="124">Chri&s;t &s;aid thus. Peter, I do mean, by thus &s;itting in thy boat, that thou go to Rome, and be bi&s;hop there five and twenty years after mine a&s;cen&s;ion; and that all thy &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hall be rulers of the univer&s;al church after thee.&mdash;Well; it followeth in the text, launch out into the deep. Here Peter was made a great man, and all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors after him, &s;ay the papi&s;ts. And their argument is this, he &s;pake to Peter only, and in the &s;ingular number; therefore he gave him pre-eminence above the re&s;t. A goodly argument! I wene it to be a &s;yllogi&s;mus. Well; I will make a like argument. Our Saviour Chri&s;t &s;aid to Judas, when he was about to betray him, What thou do&s;t, do quickly. He &s;pake in the &s;ingular number to him; therefore he gave him pre-eminence.&mdash;Belike, he made him a cardinal; and it might full well be, for they have followed Judas ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>In this &s;ermon, likewi&s;e, he again attacks the clergy. "Chri&s;t tells us, &s;aith he, it be|hoved him to preach the go&s;pel, for therefore was he &s;ent. Is it a marvellous thing, that our unpreaching prelates can read this place, and yet preach &s;o little as they do? I marvel that they can go quietly to bed.&mdash;The devil hath &s;et up a &s;tate of unpreaching prelacy
<PB N="121" REF="125">the&s;e &s;even hundred years, and hath made unpreaching prelates. &mdash; I heard of a bi&s;hop of England, that went on a vi&s;ita|tion, and when he &s;hould have been rung in|to the town, as the cu&s;tom is, the great bell's clapper was fallen down. There was a great matter made of this, and the chief of the pa|ri&s;h were much blamed for it in the vi&s;itation; and the bi&s;hop was &s;omewhat quick with them. They made their an&s;wers, and ex|cu&s;ed them&s;elves as well as they could: it was a chance, they &s;aid; and it &s;hould be amend|ed as &s;hortly as it might be. Among them there was one wi&s;er than the re&s;t, who comes up to the bi&s;hop: "Why, my lord, &s;ays he, doth your lord&s;hip make &s;o great a matter of the bell that lacketh a clapper? Here is a bell, &s;aith he, and pointed to the pulpit, that hath lacked a clapper the&s;e twenty years." I war|rant you, this bi&s;hop was an unpreaching pre|late: he could find fault with the bell that wanted a clapper to ring him into town, but he could find no fault with the par&s;on that preach|ed not at his benefice. &mdash; I came once my&s;elf to a place, riding on a journey, and &s;ent word over-night into the town, that I would preach there in the morning, becau&s;e it was a holi|day. The church &s;tood in my way, and I took
<PB N="122" REF="126">my hor&s;e, and rode thither, thinking I &s;hould have found a great company at church. When I came there, the church-door was fa&s;t lock|ed. I tarried there half an hour and more: at la&s;t, one of the pari&s;h comes to me, and &s;ays, Sir, this is a bu&s;y day with us, we cannot hear you: it is Robin Hood's day: the pari&s;h are gone abroad to gather for Robin Hood; I pray you hinder them not. And &s;o I was fain to give place to Robin Hood. And all this cometh of unpreaching prelates: if the bi&s;hops had been preachers, there &s;hould never have been any &s;uch thing.&mdash;They upbraid the peo|ple with ignorance, when they were the cau&s;e of it them&s;elves."</P>
<P>He concludes his &s;ermon with an addre&s;s to the king. "I know no man, &s;aith he, that hath greater labour than the king. What is his labour? To &s;tudy God's book: to &s;ee that there be no unpreaching prelates in his realm, nor bribing judges; to &s;ee to all e&s;tates; to provide for the poor; to &s;ee that victuals are good and cheap. And is not this a labour, trow ye?&mdash;Chri&s;t teacheth us by his example, that he abhorreth all idlene&s;s; when he was a carpenter, he did the work of his calling; and when he was a preacher, he did the work
<PB N="123" REF="127">of that calling: he was no unpreaching pre|late,"</P>
<P>His &s;eventh &s;ermon was preached upon Good-friday, and is adapted to the day. It affords little opportunity, therefore, of dwelling upon the corruptions of the age. He begins with recapitulating the &s;ubjects of his former di&s;cour&s;es, "I have intreated, &s;ays he, of &s;uch matters as I thought fit for this auditory. I have had ado with many e&s;tates, even with the highe&s;t of all. I have intreated of the duty of kings, of the duty of magi&s;trates, and judges, and of the duty of prelates: and I think there is none of us, neither preacher nor hearer, but may be amended, and redre&s;s our lives. We may all &s;ay, yea, all the pack of us, we have &s;inned with our fathers, and done wickedly.&mdash;You that be of the court, and e&s;pe|cially the &s;worn chaplains, beware of a le&s;&s;on, which a great man taught me upon my fir&s;t coming to court. He told it me for good-will, and thought it well. You mu&s;t beware, &s;aid he, however you do, not to contrary the king: let him have his &s;ayings, and go with him. Marry, out upon this, coun&s;el: &s;hall I &s;ay, as he &s;aith? ay your con&s;cience, or el&s;e what a worm &s;hall you feel gnawing?
<PB N="124" REF="128">what remor&s;e &s;hall you have, when you re|member how you have &s;lacked your duty?"</P>
<P>In this &s;ermon he gives his opinion of the fathers. Having found fault with an inter|pretation, which Origen hath given of a pa&s;|&s;age of &s;cripture; "The&s;e doctors, &s;ays he, we have great cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for; but I would not have them always allowed. They have handled many points of our faith very godly; and we may have a great &s;tay upon them in many things: we might not well lack them. But yet, I would not have men to be &s;worn to them, and &s;o addict, as to take hand over head what&s;oever they &s;ay: it were a great inconvenience &s;o to do."</P>
<P>In his la&s;t &s;ermon, which he acquaints his audience, &s;hall be the la&s;t be will ever preach in that place, he touches upon all the parti|cular corruptions of the age. He begins it thus: "Take heed, and beware of covetou&s;|ne&s;s: take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s; take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s: take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s: and what if I &s;hould &s;ay nothing el&s;e the&s;e three or four hours, but the&s;e words?&mdash; Great complaints there are of it, and much crying out, and much preaching; but little amendment, that
<PB N="125" REF="129">I can &s;ee&mdash;Covetou&s;ne&s;s is the root of all evil. Then have at the root: out with your &s;words, ye preachers, and &s;trike at the root. Stand not ticking and toying at the branches, for new branches will &s;pring out again, but &s;trike at the root, and fear not the&s;e great men; the&s;e men of power; the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors of the needy; fear them not, but &s;trike at the root."</P>
<P>In this &s;ermon he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf fre|quently, and with great freedom to the king. "I come now, &s;ays he, rather as a &s;uiter to your maje&s;ty, than a preacher: for I come to take my la&s;t farewel in this place: and here I will a&s;k a petition. For the love of God take an order for marriages here in Eng|land. There is much adultery now-a-days, not only in the nobility, but among the in|ferior &s;ort. I could wi&s;h, therefore, that a law might be provided in this behalf, and that adulterers might be puni&s;hed with death. If the hu&s;band, or wife &s;hould become &s;uiter, they might be pardoned the fir&s;t time, but not the &s;econd.&mdash;And here I have another &s;uit to your maje&s;ty: when you come to age, be|ware what per&s;ons you have about you. For if you be &s;et on plea&s;ure, or di&s;po&s;ed to wan|tonne&s;s, you &s;hall have mini&s;ters enough to
<PB N="126" REF="130">be fartherers and in&s;trument&s;s of it.&mdash;Fear not foreign princes, and foreign powers. God &s;hall make you &s;trong enough: fear him; fear not them. Peradventure you &s;hall have that &s;hall move you, and &s;ay unto you; "oh, Sir, &s;uch a one is a mighty prince, and a king of great power: you cannot be without his friend&s;hip: agree with him in religion, or el&s;e you &s;hall have him your enemy." Well; fear them not; cleave to God; and he &s;hall defend you: though you &s;hould have that would turn with you, yea, even in their white rochets.&mdash;Beware, therefore, of two affections, fear, and love. And I require you, look to your office your&s;elf, and lay not all on the of|ficers backs. Receive bills of &s;upplication your&s;elf. I do not &s;ee you do now-a-days, as you were wont to do la&s;t year. Poor men put up bills every day, and never the nearer. Begin, therefore, doing of your office your|&s;elf, now when you are young; and &s;it once or twice in the week in council among your lords: it will cau&s;e things to have good &s;uc|ce&s;s, and matters will not be &s;o lingered from day to day."</P>
<P>With equal &s;pirit he taxes the inferior or|ders of men. "Ye noblemen, &s;ays he, I
<PB N="127" REF="131">wot not what rule ye keep, but for God's &s;ake, hear the complaints of the poor. Many complain again&s;t you, that ye lie in bed till eight, nine, or ten o'clock. I cannot tell what revel ye have over night, whether banquet|ing, dicing, carding, or how it is: but in the morning, when poor &s;uiters come to your hou&s;es, ye cannot be &s;poke with. They are kept &s;ometimes without your gates; or if they be let into the hall, or &s;ome outer chamber, out cometh one or other; Sir, you cannot &s;peak with my lord yet, he is a&s;leep. And thus poor &s;uiters are driven from day to day, that they cannot &s;peak with you. For God's love, look better to it; &s;peak with poor men, when they come to your hou&s;es, and di&s;patch poor &s;uiters. I went one day my&s;elf betimes in the morning to a great man's hou&s;e, to &s;peak with him of bu&s;ine&s;s. And methought, I was up betimes: but when I came thither, the great man was gone forth about &s;uch affairs as be|hoved him. Well, thought I, this is well: I like this. This man doth &s;omewhat regard his duty. I came too late for my own mat|ter, and lo&s;t my journey; but I was glad to be &s;o beguiled. For God's &s;ake, ye great men, follow this example: ri&s;e in the mornings:
<PB N="128" REF="132">be ready for &s;uiters that re&s;ort to you; and di&s;patch them out of hand.&mdash;In the city of Corinth, one had married his &s;tep-mother: he was a jolly fellow, a great rich man, belike an alderman of the city, and &s;o they winked at it, and would not meddle with the matter. But St. Paul hearing of it, wrote unto them, and in God's behalf, charged them to do away &s;uch abomination from among them: nor would he leave them, till he had excommu|nicated that wicked per&s;on. If ye now &s;hould excommunicate all &s;uch wicked per&s;ons, there would be much ado in England. But the magi&s;trates &s;hew favour to &s;uch, and will not &s;uffer them to be rooted out, or put to &s;hame. Oh! he is &s;uch a man's &s;ervant, we may not meddle with him. Oh! he is a gentleman, we may not put him to &s;hame. And &s;o lechery is u&s;ed throughout all England; and &s;uch le|chery as is u&s;ed in no other part of the world. And yet it is made a matter of &s;port, a laugh|ing matter, not to be heeded. But beware, ye magi&s;trates; for God's love beware of this leaven. I would wi&s;h that Mo&s;es's law might be re&s;tored for puni&s;hment of lechery.&mdash;Fear not man, but God. If there be a judg|ment between a poor man, and a great man,
<PB N="129" REF="133">what, mu&s;t there be a corruption of ju&s;tice? Oh! he is a great man, I dare not di&s;plea&s;e him. Fie upon thee! art thou a judge, and wilt be afraid to give right judgment? Fear him not, be he never &s;o great a man, but up|rightly do true ju&s;tice. Likewi&s;e &s;ome pa&s;tors go from their cure: they are afraid of the plague: they dare not come nigh any &s;ick body; but hire others, and they go away them&s;elves. Out upon thee: the wolf cometh upon thy flock to devour them, and when they have mo&s;t need of thee, thou runne&s;t away from them. The &s;oldier al&s;o, that &s;hould go to war, will draw back as much as he can. Oh! I &s;hall be &s;lain! Oh! &s;uch and &s;uch went, and never came back! &s;uch men went into Norfolk, and were &s;lain there. But if the king commandeth thee to go, thou art bound to go. Follow thy occupation: in &s;erving the king, thou &s;halt &s;erve God.</P>
<P>Ye bribers, that go &s;ecretly about taking bribes, have in your minds, when ye devi&s;e your &s;ecret fetches, how Elizeus's &s;ervant was &s;erved, and was openly known. For God's proverb will be true: there is nothing hid, that &s;hall not be revealed. He that took the &s;ilver ba&s;on and ewer for a bribe, think|eth
<PB N="130" REF="134">that it will never come out; but he may now know that I know it; and not only I, but there be many more that know it. It will never be merry in England, till we have the &s;kins of &s;uch. For what needeth bribing, where men do their bu&s;ine&s;s uprightly. I have to lay out for the king three thou&s;and pounds: well, when I have laid it out, and bring in mine account, I mu&s;t give three hundred marks to have my bills warranted. If I have done truly and uprightly, what need I give a penny to have my bills warranted? If I do bring in a true account, wherefore &s;hould one groat be given? Smell ye nothing in this? What need any bribes be given, except the bills be fal&s;e?&mdash;Well, &s;uch practice hath been in England; but beware, it will out one day.&mdash;And here now I would &s;peak to you, my ma&s;|ters minters, augmentationers, receivers, &s;ur|veyors, and auditors: ye are known well enough what ye were afore ye came to your offices, and what lands ye had then, and what ye have purcha&s;ed &s;ince, and what buildings ye make daily. Well: I doubt not but there be &s;ome good officers among you, but I will not &s;wear for all.&mdash; And for the love of God, let poor workmen be paid. They make their
<PB N="131" REF="135">moan, that they can get no money. The poor labourers, gun-makers, powder-men, bow-makers, arrow-makers, &s;miths, carpenters and other crafts cry for their wages. They be un|paid, &s;ome of them, three or four months, &s;ome of them half a year, yea, &s;ome of them put up bills this time twelve month for their money, and cannot be paid yet.&mdash; The fir&s;t lent I preached here, I preached of re&s;titu|tion: Re&s;titution, quoth &s;ome, what &s;hould he preach of re&s;titution? let him preach of contrition, and let re&s;titution alone: we can never make re&s;titution. Then &s;ay I, if thou wilt not make re&s;titution, thou &s;halt go to the devil. Now choo&s;e thee either re&s;titution, or damnation. There be two kinds of re&s;titu|tion, &s;ecret and open: and whether of the two be u&s;ed, if re&s;titution be made, it is well enough. At my fir&s;t preaching of re&s;titution, one man took remor&s;e of con&s;cience, and ac|knowledged to me, that he had deceived the king; and was willing to make re&s;titution: &s;o the fir&s;t lent, twenty pounds came to my hands for the king's u&s;e. I was promi&s;ed twenty pounds more the &s;ame lent, but it could not be made up, &s;o that it came not. Well, the next lent came three hundred and twenty
<PB N="132" REF="136">pounds more: I received it my&s;elf, and paid it to the king's council. There I was a&s;ked, what he was that had thus made re&s;titution? But &s;hould I have named him? nay, they &s;hould as &s;oon have had this we&s;and of mine. Well; now this lent came one hundred and eighty pounds more, which I have paid this pre&s;ent day to the king's council. And &s;o this man hath made a goodly re&s;titution. If every one who hath beguiled the king (&s;aid I to a certain nobleman, who is one of the king's council) &s;hould make re&s;titution after this &s;ort, it would cough up the king, I warrant you, twenty thou&s;and pounds. Yea, quoth the other, a whole hundred thou&s;and pounds. Alack, alack! make re&s;titution; for God's &s;ake make re&s;titution: you will cough in hell el&s;e, that all the devils will laugh at your coughing. There is no remedy: re&s;titution or hell. Now this is of &s;ecret re&s;titution. Some examples have been of open re&s;titution. I am not afraid to name one: it was ma&s;ter Sherington, an hone&s;t gentleman, and one that God loveth. He openly confe&s;&s;ed, that he had deceived the king, and made open re&s;titution. Oh, what an argument may he have again&s;t the devil!"</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="137">I will conclude the&s;e extracts, with his own apology for his free &s;peaking. "England, &s;ays he, cannot abide this geer; it cannot hear God's mini&s;ter, and his threatning again&s;t &s;in. Though the &s;ermon be never &s;o good, and never &s;o true, &s;trait, he is a &s;editious fellow, he maketh trouble and rebellion in the realm, he lacketh di&s;cretion. The Ninevites re|buked not Jonas, that he lacked di&s;cretion, or that he &s;pake out of time. But in England, if God's preacher be any thing quick, or &s;peak &s;harply, then he is a fooli&s;h fellow, and lack|eth di&s;cretion. Now-a-days, if they cannot reprove the doctrine, they will reprove the preacher: what! preach &s;uch things now! He &s;hould have re&s;pect to the time, and the &s;tate of things. It rejoiceth me, when my friends tell me, that people find fault with my di&s;cretion: for by likelihood, think I, the doctrine is true: for if they could find fault with the doctrine, they would not charge me with the lack of di&s;cretion, or the inconve|niency of the time. I will a&s;k you a que&s;tion: I pray you, when &s;hould Jonas have preached again&s;t the covetou&s;ne&s;s of Nineveh, if the co|vetous men &s;hould have appointed him his time? I know that preachers ought to have
<PB N="134" REF="138">di&s;cretion in their preaching; and that they ought to have a con&s;ideration, and re&s;pect to the place and the time, where and when they preach: and I &s;ay here what I would not &s;ay in the country for no good. But what then? Sin mu&s;t be rebuked: &s;in mu&s;t be plainly &s;po|ken again&s;t."</P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Latimer: &s;uperior to all cor|ruption him&s;elf, he kept in awe a licentious court. Nor will the reader take offence at my multiplying upon him &s;o many large quo|tations. I not only thought them very va|luable remains, but a very nece&s;&s;ary ornament likewi&s;e to this part of my hi&s;tory. For it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have given a true idea, in any words but his own, of that noble zeal in the cau&s;e of truth, which upon all occa&s;ions he exerted, and which makes &s;o principal a part of his character. Nor can we wonder at the effect of his preaching, when we con&s;ider its freedom. He charged vice &s;o home upon the con&s;ciences of the guilty, that he left no room for &s;elf-deceit, or mi&s;applica|tion: it being a more nece&s;&s;ary part, in his opinion, of the preacher's office, to rouze men into a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, than to di&s;cour&s;e them merely in the didactic &s;train; ina&s;much as mo&s;t men know more than they practi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Mr. Latimer was thus di&s;charg|ing the duty of a court preacher, a &s;lander pa&s;t upon him; which being taken up by a low hi&s;torian of tho&s;e times, hath found its way into the&s;e. The matter of it is, that, after the lord high admiral's attainder and execution, which happened about this time, Mr. Latimer publicly defended his death in a &s;ermon before the king; that he a&s;per&s;ed his character; and that he did it merely to pay a &s;ervile compliment to the protector. The fir&s;t part of the charge is true; but the &s;econd, and third are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>As for his a&s;per&s;ing the admiral's character, his character was &s;o bad, there was no room for a&s;per&s;ion. A more debauched per&s;on hath rarely infe&s;ted a court, than he was, during the la&s;t reign. But years growing upon him, and his appetite for plea&s;ure abating, his pa&s;&s;ions took a new cour&s;e, and from a voluptuous, he became an ambitious man. The pravity of his di&s;po&s;ition, however, continued the &s;ame, though the object of his pur&s;uit was altered. Having married the queen dowager of Eng|land,
<PB N="136" REF="140">he began to rai&s;e his expectations to great heights. But enlarging his views &s;till farther as he ro&s;e, and finding his marriage an incumbrance to him, he ea&s;ed him&s;elf of it, as is generally &s;u&s;pected, by unfair means. This was done to make way for the prince&s;s Elizabeth, to who&s;e bed he a&s;pired; and, by her means, to the crown. But being di&s;ap|pointed of this, he entered into cabals again&s;t his brother the protector, &s;et him&s;elf at the head of a party, and went &s;o far as even to coin money, and rai&s;e troops; threat|ning to take the king, and the govern|ment out of his brother's hands. For the&s;e trea&s;onable actions, and after frequent and fruitle&s;s admonitions from his brother, he was &s;entenced to lo&s;e his head: having been pro|&s;ecuted according to the u&s;ual, but inequitable practice of tho&s;e times, by a bill in parliament; though there was matter enough to have con|demned him in a fairer trial.</P>
<P>But though the lord Sudley paid only &s;o due a forfeit to the laws of his country, and had indeed been u&s;ed with much greater ten|derne&s;s, than his offences de&s;erved; yet his death occa&s;ioned great clamour, and was made u&s;e of by the lords of the oppo&s;ition (for he
<PB N="137" REF="141">left a very di&s;&s;atisfied party behind him) as a handle to rai&s;e a popular odium again&s;t the protector.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer had always a high e&s;teem for the protector: he thought him an hone&s;t and a good man; and of better intentions towards the public, than any of the lords at that time about the king. He was mortified therefore to &s;ee &s;o invidious and ba&s;e an oppo&s;ition thwarting the &s;chemes of &s;o public-&s;pirited a man; and endeavoured to le&s;&s;en the odium by &s;hewing the admiral's character in its true light, from &s;ome anecdotes not commonly known.</P>
<P>Since therefore Mr. Latimer's behaviour, in this in&s;tance, may be &s;o fairly accounted for; and &s;ince his whole character was &s;o contradictory to any &s;ini&s;ter practice, I per|&s;uade my&s;elf, that I have &s;aid enough to wipe this reproach from his memory. What could induce that man to flatter the great, who, for the &s;ake of truth, had voluntarily re&s;igned one of the highe&s;t offices in his profe&s;&s;ion; and which, when voluntarily offered to him again, he had refu&s;ed: a man too, who had taken all opportunities of inveighing again&s;t the vices of the greate&s;t per&s;onages with a freedom,
<PB N="138" REF="142">which in the &s;tricte&s;t times would have been admired? So improbable indeed the &s;lander is, that I &s;hould not have taken the pains I have taken to confute it, if it had not been credited, at lea&s;t recorded as credible, by &s;o great a man as our countryman John Milton; who, being a warm party-writer in the re|publican times of the Oliverian u&s;urpation, &s;uffers his zeal again&s;t epi&s;copacy, in more in|&s;tances than this, to bias his veracity, or at be&s;t, to impo&s;e upon his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But though the protector had thus tri|umphed over the wicked practices of his brother, he did not long &s;urvive him. The oppo&s;ition &s;oon revived under another, and a more formidable head, the duke of Northum|land.</P>
<P>This nobleman was the &s;on of that infamous Dudley, who, in the days of Henry VII. drew upon him&s;elf the odium of the nation by the invidious employment he held under that avaricious prince. When Henry VIII. came to the crown, he &s;acrificed the father to the re&s;entment of the people, and rai&s;ed the &s;on to be a peer of the realm. But during the reign of this prince, he never appeared of prime con&s;ideration in the public eye. In
<PB N="139" REF="143">king Edward's reign he &s;hewed him&s;elf with di&s;tinction enough. He was a man of unli|cenced plea&s;ure, and unbounded ambition, more debauched, if po&s;&s;ible, and more a&s;piring than even the lord Sudley; and by far more dangerous; ina&s;much as he was more artful than he, more deep, more &s;pecious, and more prudent. He was at the &s;ame time &s;o re&s;o|lute and daring, that nothing arduous or dan|gerous ever checked him. In a word, he had more mi&s;chievous de&s;igns, and better abilities to do mi&s;chief, than any man of his time, ex|cepting only the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>This per&s;on had long viewed the protector with an eye of jealou&s;y and hatred. He was agitating great &s;chemes for the agrandizement of his family, and knew that while the pro|tector lived, he could but little advance them. Re&s;olving therefore to rid him&s;elf of this ob|&s;tacle, he laid a train with equal malice and dexterity, which in the end effected his de|&s;ign. The protector, intangled in his con|trivances, lo&s;t his life, and left an open field for the machinations of his enemy.</P>
<P>From this time I meet with no accounts of Mr. Latimer, during the remainder of king Edward's reign. It &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that
<PB N="140" REF="144">upon this revolution at court, he retired into the country, and made u&s;e of the king's li|cence, as a general preacher, in tho&s;e parts, where he thought his labours might be mo&s;t u&s;eful: I &s;hall, however, for the &s;ake of con|nection, &s;ketch out the intervening hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, till we meet with Mr. Latimer again, in the order of them.</P>
<P>After the protector's death, the duke of Northumberland became all-powerful at court; and &s;oon began to execute the wicked projects he had planned. His fir&s;t &s;tep was to bring about a marriage between his &s;on Guilford Dudley, and the elde&s;t daughter of the hou&s;e of Suffolk, a hou&s;e nearly related to the crown.</P>
<P>About the time when this alliance was con|cluded, the king fell &s;ick; and his di&s;temper increa&s;ing, though the &s;ymptoms were not yet violent, the duke advi&s;ed the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Great objections were made to the prince&s;s Mary, on the account of her religion: and objections were made both to her and her &s;i&s;ter, on the account of their ille|gitimacy. But though they had an act of par|liament in their favour, by the duke's ma|nagement, they were both &s;et a&s;ide, and the
<PB N="141" REF="145">crown was &s;ettled upon his daughter-in-law, the lady Jane Grey; who, upon the king's death, which happened &s;oon after, was pro|claimed queen of England. The world ob|&s;erving how aptly the king's death coincided with the duke's de&s;igns, had little rea&s;on to doubt of its being a projected part of a regu|lar plan.</P>
<P>Thus far the duke &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h, and found a more general concurrence in the officers of &s;tate and judges, than he could have expected. But in the mid&s;t of this tranqui|lity a &s;udden &s;torm aro&s;e.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s Mary, of whom he fatally thought him&s;elf too &s;ecure, found adherents in many parts of the nation, mo&s;t of whom nothing but their great aver&s;ion to the duke's government, could have drawn to her party. Her power daily increa&s;ing, the duke led an army again&s;t her. But his efforts were vain. While his forces were continually dimini&s;h|ing by revolts, he was thunder-&s;truck with news from London, that the council had de|&s;erted him, and had proclaimed queen Mary. Thus for&s;aken of all his friends, like other di&s;appointed villains, he for&s;ook him&s;elf; and agonizing for &s;ome time under the pangs of
<PB N="142" REF="146">baffled guilt and ambition, he gave at la&s;t a temporary ca&s;e to his di&s;tracted thoughts, by &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to the queen's mercy: and if every &s;ervile compliance, even to the ab|juring the religion he had all his life profe&s;&s;ed, could have &s;aved him, he had been &s;aved. But his crimes exceeded forgivene&s;s. He was given up therefore to ju&s;tice, and ended his life up|on a &s;caffold.</P>
<P>With him fell his new creation, queen Jane, an incomparable lady, endowed with every virtue; unfortunate only in having been made the tool of a practi&s;ed villain.</P>
<P>Queen Mary having thus obtained the crown, began next to think of &s;ettling her government. Religion was her fir&s;t care. As to her own principles, they were well known; though &s;he had temporized under her father, with a good &s;hare of compliance, and had made promi&s;es too, upon her advancement to the crown, that &s;he would introduce no public change in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. But promi&s;es of this kind met with ea&s;y di&s;|pen&s;ations. She re&s;olved, therefore, as &s;oon as &s;he could, to re&s;tore popery, and reconcile the nation to the &s;ee of Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="147">Her chief mini&s;ters in this de&s;ign were Stephen Gardiner, now made lord chancellor, and Edmund Bonner, bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e per&s;ons hath already been often mentioned in a di&s;advantageous light. He was a man, indeed, formed by na|ture, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to do mi&s;chief. He had a bad heart, a clear head, quick parts, improved by long practice in the world, and a dark in&s;crutable mind, in which he trea&s;ured up every thing that pa&s;&s;ed by him; and lay|ing things together with wonderful &s;agacity, formed the deepe&s;t &s;chemes. The&s;e he could with great judgment adapt to circum&s;tances as they aro&s;e: and what cunning and di&s;&s;i|mulation could not effect, in which he ex|celled all men of his time, he went through with by a cool, and yet dauntle&s;s re&s;olution. He was naturally fierce and cruel; and this temper was inflamed by the u&s;age he had met with, which was indeed but indifferent, under king Edward: &s;o that he bent him&s;elf to per|&s;ecution in the full &s;pirit of retaliation.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of London had formerly main|tained an intere&s;t with Henry VIII. by means of the lowe&s;t adulation, to which that prince was very open: and though he went along
<PB N="144" REF="148">with the innovations of that reign, yet when queen Mary began to look among her friends, his &s;ufferings under king Edward were ac|cepted as an atonement. Hitherto he had acted in di&s;gui&s;e; but finding him&s;elf now free from all re&s;traint, the whole man ap|peared. And &s;ure the genius of popery had never a more proper &s;ubject to work on. He was a man of violent pa&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e of the &s;anguine kind: of little ob&s;ervation and know|ledge, and without any judgment; as if ju&s;t prepared for the infu&s;ions of blind zeal and prejudice.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the per&s;ons, from who&s;e coun|&s;els, (upon the pre&s;ent revolution of govern|ment) the &s;ettlement of religion was expect|ed. Bonner was indeed little more than an agent in the hands of Gardiner, who on many occa&s;ions cho&s;e rather to &s;it concealed, and work mi&s;chief by proxy. It &s;uited the dark|ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and he found in Bon|ner an in&s;trument intirely adapted to his pur|po&s;e; open ears, an impetuous temper, raging zeal, a hardened heart, and an ob&s;tinate per|&s;everance: &s;o that Gardiner had only to wind him up occa&s;ionally, and give him a proper di|rection; and the zealot moved with the regu|larity
<PB N="145" REF="149">of a machine, and with what impetuo&s;i|ty his director impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The introduction of popery being thus re|&s;olved on, the fir&s;t &s;tep which was taken was to prohibit all preaching throughout the king|dom; and to licence only &s;uch as were known to be popi&s;hly inclined.</P>
<P>The queen's de&s;igns being now every where apparent, the reformed clergy pre&s;ently took the alarm. They &s;aw their pari&s;hes about to be corrupted by Romi&s;h preachers, who &s;pread them&s;elves over the nation in great numbers; and thinking, in the primitive man|ner, that it was right to obey God rather than man, they re&s;olved to endure the wor&s;t for the &s;ake of their religion. Many of them, there|fore, preached with great freedom, in their accu&s;tomed manner, again&s;t the doctrines of popery. And, to &s;et them an example, arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer drew up a very free paper, by way of prote&s;tation again&s;t the ma&s;s; which got abroad before he publi&s;hed it. Upon this he was &s;ent for by the council; and being que&s;tioned about it, he boldly an&s;wered, "The paper was his, and he was only &s;orry, that he had not fixed it, as he intended, with his hand and &s;eal, upon St. Paul's gate." Mo&s;t
<PB N="146" REF="150">men wondered that he was &s;uffered to e&s;cape; but it was thought more prudent to begin with the inferior clergy. Accordingly, a &s;trict in|quiry was made after the more forward and popular preachers; and many of them were taken into cu&s;tody: &s;ome without any cau&s;e al|ledged; particularly Rogers and Bradford, who had u&s;ed their popularity in no in&s;tance, &s;ince the late change of government, but in re&s;cuing a popi&s;h prie&s;t from an inraged multitude. After the&s;e, others of more di&s;tinction were impri&s;oned; and in a little time the arch|bi&s;hop him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE this &s;evere inquiry was carrying on in London, Mr. Latimer was in the country, where he continued preaching in his u&s;ual manner, unaffected by the danger of the times. But he did not long enjoy this liberty. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who had pro&s;cribed him with the fir&s;t, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to cite him before the council. He had notice of this de&s;ign &s;ome hours before the me&s;&s;enger's arrival: but he made no u&s;e of the intelli|gence. Like other eminent reformers of that time, he cho&s;e rather to meet, than avoid a que&s;tion; thinking that he could not give a nobler te&s;timony to the uprightne&s;s of his con&s;cience, than by &s;hewing the world it was a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to him in whatever dan|gers it might involve him.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger therefore found him equip|ped for his journey: at which, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize, Mr. Latimer told him, "That he was as ready to attend him to London, thus called upon to an&s;wer for his faith, as he ever was to take any journey in his life: and that he doubted not but that God, who had already
<PB N="148" REF="152">enabled him to &s;tand before two princes, would enable him to &s;tand before a third." The me&s;&s;enger then acquainting him, that he had no orders to &s;eize his per&s;on, delivered a letter, and departed. From which it is plain, they cho&s;e rather to drive him out of the king|dom, than to bring him to any public que&s;tion. They well knew the firmne&s;s of his mind; and were afraid, as Mr. Fox ob&s;erves, "le&s;t his con&s;tancy &s;hould deface them in their pope|ry, and confirm the godly in the truth."</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer, however, opening the letter, and finding it to contain a citation from the council, re&s;olved to obey it. He &s;et out, therefore, immediately for London. As he pa&s;&s;ed through Smithfield, where heretics were u&s;ually burnt, he &s;aid chearfully, "This place hath long groaned for me." The next morning he waited upon the council; who having loaded him with many &s;evere re|proaches, &s;ent him to the tower.</P>
<P>This was but a repetition of a former part of his life: only he now met with har&s;her treat|ment, and had more frequent occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e his re&s;ignation; which virtue no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a larger mea&s;ure. Nay|even the u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="149" REF="153">did not now for&s;ake him; of which we have one in&s;tance &s;till remaining.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant leaving his apartment, Mr. Lati|mer called after him, and bid him tell his ma&s;ter, "That unle&s;s he took better care of him, he would certainly e&s;cape him." Upon this me&s;&s;age, the lieutenant, with &s;ome di&s;|compo&s;ure in his countenance, came to Mr. Latimer, and de&s;ired an explanation of what he had &s;aid to his &s;ervant. "Why, you ex|pect, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, replied Mr. Latimer, that I &s;hould be burned; but if you do not allow me a little fire, this fro&s;ty weather, I can tell you, I &s;hall fir&s;t be &s;tarved."</P>
<P>In the mean time the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and his friends held frequent councils on pub|lic affairs; and endeavoured to impo&s;e upon the world, by making it believe, that rea&s;on as well as power was on their &s;ide. With this view it was re&s;olved, that when the convoca|tion met, the argument between the papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants &s;hould be handled. But Gar|diner was a better politician, than to commit a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence to a fair debate. He had provided for the &s;ucce&s;s, therefore, by modelling a convocation to his mind; in which only &s;ix prote&s;tant divines got admittance. By
<PB N="150" REF="154">this junto, points of divinity and articles of faith were &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tants, as they very well might, were loud in their clamour again&s;t &s;uch ma|nife&s;t partiality; and made &s;o fair a repre&s;en|tation of the di&s;ingenuous treatment they had received, that Gardiner found his cau&s;e rather injured by what he had done, than promoted. He re&s;olved, therefore, to do &s;omething in the &s;ame way le&s;s liable to exception: and &s;oon after, it was given out, that the controver&s;y between the papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants &s;hould be finally determined in a &s;olemn di&s;putation to be held at Oxford, between the mo&s;t emi|nent divines on each &s;ide. And &s;o far the pa|pi&s;ts acted hone&s;tly: for Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, who were confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t eminent divines of their party, and were de|&s;igned for this employment by the expecta|tion of all men who wi&s;hed well to truth, were appointed to manage the di&s;pute on the part of the prote&s;tant. Accordingly, they were taken out of the tower, where they had all been impri&s;oned, and were &s;ent to Ox|ford.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e three, Ridley was generally e&s;teemed the mo&s;t eminent for parts and
<PB N="151" REF="155">learning; as indeed he was &s;uperior in the&s;e points to mo&s;t men of the age in which he lived. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e, in a great de|gree, all tho&s;e valuable qualities, which make a man amiable in &s;ociety. All the virtues of humanity were kneaded in his compo&s;ition. Through Cranmer's recommendation, in king Edward's time, he was promoted to the bi|&s;hopric of London, over which he pre&s;ided with that exemplary lu&s;tre, which piety and virtue add to eminence of &s;tation. In the be|ginning of queen Mary, he was involved with the fir&s;t in the troubles of the times, which no man endured with greater con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tant di&s;putants being thus ap|pointed, proper per&s;ons were next thought on to oppo&s;e them. At length it was deter|mined to a&s;&s;ign this office to Dr. We&s;ton, prolocutor of the convocation, and an a&s;&s;em|bly of divines cho&s;en out of both univer&s;ities. Letters therefore were di&s;patched to Oxford, to put all things in readine&s;s; and &s;oon after to Cambridge, where commi&s;&s;ioners were im|mediately appointed.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Latimer, and his companions were clo&s;ely confined at Oxford, in the common pri&s;on; deprived of every
<PB N="152" REF="156">comfort, but what their own brea&s;ts could ad|mini&s;ter. How free the di&s;putation was like|ly to be, they might ea&s;ily imagine, when they found them&s;elves denied the u&s;e even of books, and pen and ink. Their pri&s;on-hours, however, were not &s;pent in vain lamentations: their religion rai&s;ed them above all human &s;ufferings, and all mortal fears.</P>
<P>Their chief re&s;ource was in prayer, in which exerci&s;e they &s;pent great part of every day. Mr. Latimer particularly, would often continue kneeling, till he was not able to ri&s;e without help. The principal &s;ubject of his prayers was, that God would enable him to maintain the profe&s;&s;ion of his religion to the la&s;t; that God would again re&s;tore his go&s;pel to England, and pre&s;erve the prince&s;s Elizabeth to be a comfort to this land.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox has pre&s;erved a conference, after|wards put into writing, which was held at this time between bi&s;hop Ridley, and bi&s;hop La|timer. As it is worth the reader's notice, and may without any great interruption be in&s;ert|ed in this place, I &s;hall take &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages from it, as I &s;hall think worth pre&s;erving.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="157">The two bi&s;hops are repre&s;ented fitting in their pri&s;on, ruminating upon the &s;olemn preparations then making for their trial, of which probably they were now fir&s;t informed. Bi&s;hop Ridley fir&s;t broke &s;ilence. "The time, &s;aid he, is now come: we are now called upon either to deny our faith, or to &s;uffer death in its defence. You, Mr. Latimer, are an old &s;oldier of Chri&s;t, and have frequently with|&s;tood the fear of death; whereas I am raw in the &s;ervice, and unexperienced." With this preface he introduces a reque&s;t, that Mr. Lati|mer, whom he calls his father, would hear him propo&s;e &s;uch arguments as he thinks it mo&s;t likely his adver&s;aries would urge again&s;t him, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in providing him&s;elf with pro|per an&s;wers to them. To this Mr. Latimer, in his u&s;ual &s;train of good-humour, an&s;wered, that, "He fan&s;ied the good bi&s;hop was treat|ing him, as he remembered Mr. Bilney u&s;ed formerly to do, who, when he wanted to teach him, would always do it under colour of be|ing taught him&s;elf. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;ays he, my lord, I am determined for my&s;elf to give them very little trouble. I &s;hall ju&s;t offer them a plain account of my faith, and &s;hall &s;ay very little more: for I know any thing
<PB N="154" REF="158">more will be to no purpo&s;e. They talk of a free di&s;putation; but I am well a&s;&s;ured, their grand argument will be, as it was once their forefathers, "We have a law, and by our law ye ought to die." However, upon Mr. Rid|ley's pre&s;&s;ing his reque&s;t, they entered upon the examination he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>This part of their conference contains little of curious; only the common arguments a|gain&s;t the tenets of popery. When they had fini&s;hed this exerci&s;e, Ridley breaks out in this pathetic &s;train.</P>
<P>"Thus you &s;ee, good father, how I would prepare my&s;elf for my adver&s;ary; and how I would learn by practice to be expert in tho&s;e weapons, which I &s;hall pre&s;ently be obliged to wield. In Tine-dale, upon the borders of Scotland, the place of my nativity, I have known my countrymen watch night and day in arms; e&s;pecially when they had notice of any intended inroad from the Scots. And though by &s;uch bravery many of them lo&s;t their lives, yet they defended their country, died in a good cau&s;e, and intailed the love of the neighbourhood upon their po&s;terity. And &s;hall not we watch in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and in the defence of our religion, whereon de|pend
<PB N="155" REF="159">all our hopes of immortality? Shall we not go always armed? ever ready to receive a watchful foe? Let us then awake; and taking the cro&s;s upon our &s;houlders, let us follow our captain Chri&s;t, who by his own blood hath hallowed the way that leadeth to God.&mdash;Thus, good father, I have opened my heart freely unto you. And now, methinks, I &s;ee you ju&s;t about to lift up your eyes to heaven, in your accu&s;tomed manner, and turning your prophetical countenance upon me, thus to &s;peak. "Tru&s;t not, my &s;on, (I pray you vouch|&s;afe me the honour of this name, for in it I &s;hall think my&s;elf both honoured by you and loved) tru&s;t not, I &s;ay, my &s;on, to the&s;e word-weapons, but remember what our Lord &s;ays, "It &s;hall be given you in that &s;ame hour what you &s;hall &s;peak." Pray for me, O father, pray for me, that I may throw my whole care up|on God; and may tru&s;t in him only in my di&s;tre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"Of my prayers, replied the old bi&s;hop, you may be well a&s;&s;ured: nor do I doubt but I &s;hall have yours in return. And indeed, prayer and patience &s;hould be our great re&s;ources. For my&s;elf, had I the learning of St. Paul, I &s;hould think it ill laid out upon an elaborate
<PB N="156" REF="160">defence. Yet our ca&s;e, my lord, admits of comfort. Our enemies can do no more than God permits; and God is faithful; who will not &s;uffer us to be tempted above our &s;trength. Be at a point with them: &s;tand to that, and let them &s;ay and do what they plea&s;e. To u&s;e many words would be vain: yet it is requi&s;ite to give a rea&s;onable account of your faith, if they will quietly hear you. For other things, in a wicked judgment-hall, a man may keep &s;ilence after the example of Chri&s;t. As for their &s;ophi|&s;try, you know fal&s;ehood may often be di&s;|played in the colours of truth. But above all things, be upon your guard again&s;t the fear of death. This is the great argument you mu&s;t oppo&s;e.&mdash;Poor Shaxton! it is to be feared this argument had the greate&s;t weight in his recantation. But let us be &s;tedfa&s;t, and unmoveable; a&s;&s;uring our&s;elves, that we cannot be more happy, than by be|ing &s;uch Philippians, as not only believe in Chri&s;t, but dare &s;uffer for his &s;ake."&mdash;With &s;uch noble fortitude, and &s;uch exalted &s;entiments were the&s;e two great reformers of religion in&s;pired!</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t now leave them in their pri|son, and introduce a &s;cene of a different kind.</P>

<P>WE left the Cambridge commi&s;&s;ioners &s;etting out in great pomp for Oxford, where they arrived on the 13th of April, 1554. Here they were received with a profu&s;ion of academical compliments; conferring of de|grees, &s;peeches, fea&s;ts, and proce&s;&s;ions. Forms were then adju&s;ted; and a method in their proceedings agreed on by the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>In this commi&s;&s;ion were joined thirty-three per&s;ons. To run over a catalogue of their names, would be needle&s;s; as the greater part of them were men of no note. It is no breach of charity to &s;ay, they were only di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by different degrees of bi|gotry and ignorance.</P>
<P>Some among them were of more con&s;e|quence; We&s;ton, Smith, Tre&s;ham, and Ched&s;ey.</P>
<P>We&s;ton was a man of con&s;iderable learn|ing, which gave him great reputation with his party. In all points of divinity, his judg|ment was e&s;teemed deci&s;ive; and none was thought more worthy to pre&s;ide over the con|vocation. His religion, however, was only in
<PB N="158" REF="162">his head: it made no impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart. Yet he maintained a decent out&s;ide; and had the addre&s;s to pa&s;s off in the world a great &s;hare of &s;piritual pride for &s;anctity of manners: till having at length the misfor|tune to be taken in adultery, he was generally known. He was at this time, however, in the meridian of his credit.</P>
<P>Smith was a mere temporizer, and had all his life taken his creed from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. He had been bred a papi&s;t, and had written with &s;ome credit again&s;t prie&s;t's mar|riage. But when prote&s;tanti&s;m took the lead, he got him&s;elf recommended, through Cran|mer's means, to the reigning powers; and to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf the better, promi&s;ed to con|fute his own book. But before his treati&s;e was fini&s;hed, the times changed; and his faith changing with them, he was again taken no|tice of by the heads of the prevailing reli|gion; his pen recommending him, which was ea&s;y and elegant; while the &s;tory of his hav|ing agreed to confute his own book, which was indeed a fact, was imputed only to the malice of the adver&s;e party.</P>
<P>Tre&s;ham was an orthodox divine; but one of tho&s;e heavy mortals, who have great learn|ing,
<PB N="159" REF="163">and no &s;en&s;e. He was a bigot in the la&s;t degree. But the following &s;tory will give a ju&s;t idea of his character. When queen Mary began to think of re&s;toring the old religion at Oxford, Dr. Tre&s;ham, then &s;ub-dean of Chri&s;t-church, was among tho&s;e, who were tru&s;ted by her in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Calling together, therefore, the members of his college, he recommended popery to them in a &s;et ora|tion: and having talked over all the common-place arguments with &s;ufficient prolixity, he emphatically concluded with telling them, "That a parcel of very fine copes had been made to go to Wind&s;or; but that the queen had been &s;o gracious as to &s;end them to Chri&s;t-church; and that if they would go to ma&s;s, they &s;hould each have one: that upon that condition, he would, moreover, procure for them the lady-bell at Bampton, which would make Chri&s;t-church bells the &s;weete&s;t of any in England: and that la&s;tly, he would give them as fine a water-&s;prinkle, as eyes ever beheld."</P>
<P>But among them all, Ched&s;ey was by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. He was indeed a very able man. For parts and learning, few of his time went beyond him. But he too had a
<PB N="160" REF="164">ductile faith, which had been wholly guided by that of his &s;uperiors. He made atonement, however, for his tempori&s;ing under king Ed|ward, by his zeal in per&s;ecuting under queen Mary.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;ons, having now received all the civilities, which the zeal of Oxford could ex|pre&s;s, and having &s;ettled all previous puncti|lio's, proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s. Arraying them|&s;elves therefore in &s;carlet, they met at St. Mary's church; where &s;eating them&s;elves be|fore the altar, and placing the prolocutor in the mid&s;t, they &s;ent for the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The croud &s;oon made way for archbi&s;hop Cranmer, who was brought in by a guard of armed men. When the tumult was a little compo&s;ed, the prolocutor made a &s;hort ora|tion to his audience in prai&s;e of religious unity; and then turning to the archbi&s;hop, he re|minded him of the pious education he had received in an orthodox &s;eminary; of the emi|nent &s;tation he had held under a catholic king, and of his long attachment to popery. He then &s;poke with an affected concern of his &s;hameful apo&s;tacy; and of the &s;everal errors, which had crept into the church, while he pre&s;ided over it. La&s;tly, he acquainted
<PB N="161" REF="165">him with the de&s;ign of their pre&s;ent meeting; informing him, that the convocation, by her maje&s;ty's order, taking into con&s;ideration his apo&s;tacy, and that of his brethren, had com|mi&s;&s;ioned them to endeavour to bring them back to their mother church; that for this end certain articles had been drawn up, which the convocation had &s;igned, and which it was expected, that he too, and his brethren, would either &s;ub&s;cribe or confute.</P>
<P>The prolocutor then ordered the articles to be read aloud, which were the&s;e.</P>
<P>"The natural body of Chri&s;t is really in the &s;acrament after the words &s;poken by the prie&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;acrament, after the words of con|&s;ecration, no other &s;ub&s;tance does remain, than the &s;ub&s;tance of the body and blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the ma&s;s is a &s;acrifice propitiatory for the &s;ins of the quick and dead."</P>
<P>The articles being read, the archbi&s;hop, de&s;iring leave, read them over to him&s;elf three or four times; and then a&s;king a few perti|nent que&s;tions with regard to the import of &s;ome of the terms, with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s de|nied them all. "I am as great a friend, &s;aid
<PB N="162" REF="166">he, gentlemen, to unity, as any of you; but I can never think of making fal&s;ehood the bond of peace. The prolocutor, making no reply, ordered a copy of the articles to be de|livered to him; and fixed a day, on which he told him he expected, he would publicly maintain his negative.</P>
<P>Dr. Ridley was next brought in, who, with|out any he&s;itation, denied the articles. Upon which the prolocutor appointed him likewi&s;e a di&s;putation-day, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Latimer was brought in la&s;t, like a primitive martyr, in his pri&s;on attire. He had a cap upon his head, buttoned under his chin, a pair of &s;pectacles hanging at his brea&s;t, a New Te&s;tament under his arm, and a &s;taff in his hand. He was almo&s;t &s;pent with pre&s;|&s;ing through the croud; and the prolocutor ordering a chair to be brought for him, he walked up to it, and &s;aying, he was a very old man, &s;at down without any ceremony. The articles were then tendered to him; which he denied. The prolocutor, upon this, telling him, that he mu&s;t di&s;pute on the wedne&s;day following; the old bi&s;hop, with as much chearfulne&s;s, as he would have &s;hewn upon the mo&s;t ordinary occa&s;ion, &s;haking his pal&s;ied
<PB N="163" REF="167">head, an&s;wered, &s;miling, "Indeed, gentle|men, I am ju&s;t as well qualified to be made governor of Calais." He then complained, that he was very old, and very infirm; and &s;aid, that he had the u&s;e of no book but of that under his arm; which he had read &s;e|ven times over deliberately, without finding the lea&s;t mention made of the ma&s;s. In this &s;peech he gave great offence, by &s;aying, in his humourous way, alluding to tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion, that he could find neither the marrow-bones, nor the &s;inews of the ma&s;s in the New Te&s;tament. Upon which, the prolocutor cried out with &s;ome warmth, that he would make him find both: and when Mr. Latimer, re|collecting him&s;elf, was going to explain his meaning in that expre&s;&s;ion, he was not &s;uf|fered to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Thus the a&s;&s;embly broke up; having ob|&s;erved, upon the whole, more decency and good-manners, than was generally expected.</P>
<P>At length, the appointed day came for the archbi&s;hop's di&s;putation. You might have known &s;omething very uncommon was in agitation; for the whole univer&s;ity was in motion. Almo&s;t at day-break the &s;chools were thronged. About eight, the commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="164" REF="168">took their &s;eats; and pre&s;ently afterwards, the archbi&s;hop was brought in guarded.</P>
<P>But I will not delay the reader with the particulars of this day, nor of that, on which bi&s;hop Ridley di&s;puted. I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, for the &s;ake of truth, that the papi&s;ts do not &s;eem to have ju&s;tice done them by their prote&s;tant adver&s;aries. Let the&s;e put what glo&s;s upon the affair they plea&s;e, the papi&s;ts certainly had the better of the argument on both tho&s;e days. The ca&s;e was this, they drew their chief proofs, in favour of tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, from the fathers; many of whom, and fome of the more e&s;teemed writers among them, &s;peak on this &s;ubject in a language by no means evangelical. The two bi&s;hops ac|cordingly being thus pre&s;&s;ed by an authority, which they dur&s;t not reject, were not a little embarra&s;&s;ed. And indeed, how could a pro|te&s;tant divine defend &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as this from St. Chry&s;o&s;tom? "What a miracle is this! He who &s;its above with the Father, at the very &s;ame in&s;tant of time is handled with the hands of men?" or &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as this from the &s;ame writer, "That which is in the cup, is the &s;ame which flowed from the &s;ide of Chri&s;t?" or this from Theophilact. "Becau&s;e
<PB N="165" REF="169">we would abhor the eating of raw fle&s;h, and e&s;pecially human fle&s;h, therefore, it appear|eth as bread, though it is indeed fle&s;h?" or this from St. Au&s;tin, "Chri&s;t was carried in his own hands, when he &s;aid, this is my body?" or this from Ju&s;tin Martyr, "We are taught, that when this nouri&s;hing food is con&s;ecrated, it becomes the fle&s;h and blood of Chri&s;t?" or this from St. Ambro&s;e, "It is bread before it is con&s;ecrated, but when that ceremony hath pa&s;&s;ed upon it, of bread it be|comes the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t?" Of all the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, and many others of the &s;ame kind, the papi&s;ts, with not a little dexterity, made their avail. The two bi&s;hops, in the mean time, in&s;tead of di&s;avowing an in&s;ufficient authority, weakly defended a good cau&s;e; evading, and di&s;tingui&s;hing, after the manner of &s;chool|men. Ridley's defence indeed was ve|ry animated: for he had great quickne&s;s of parts as well as learning. Cranmer's was no way extraordinary: through his great mo|de&s;ty, he &s;eems to have been over-awed by his audience. And yet Ridley would have acted as wi&s;e a part, if he had taken his friend bi&s;hop Latimer's advice, and contented him|&s;elf with giving a rea&s;onable account of his
<PB N="166" REF="170">faith. I &s;hall only add, that the&s;e di&s;puta|tions were very tumultuous, and accompanied with great indecency both of language and behaviour on the part of the papi&s;t.</P>
<P>The day after the bi&s;hop of London di&s;|puted, bi&s;hop Latimer was called into the &s;chools. Of this day I &s;hall be more par|ticular.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners being now &s;eated, the audience formed, and the tumult of a croud in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ided, Dr. We&s;ton, the prolocutor, ri&s;ing up, acquainted his hear|ers, that the cau&s;e of their meeting was to de|fend the orthodox doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion; and to confute certain novel opinions, which had been lately propagated with great zeal in the nation! "And of you, father, &s;aid he, turning to the old bi&s;hop, I beg, if you have any thing to &s;ay, that you will be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible." This was &s;poken in Latin; upon which the bi&s;hop an&s;wered; "I hope, Sir, you will give me leave to &s;peak what I have to &s;peak in Engli&s;h: I have been very little conver&s;ant in the Latin tongue the&s;e twenty years!" The prolocutor con&s;ented; and the bi&s;hop, having thanked him, re|plied, "I will ju&s;t beg leave then, Sir, to pro|te&s;t my faith. Indeed, I am not able to di&s;|pute. I will prote&s;t my faith; and you may then do with me ju&s;t what you plea&s;e."</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172">Upon this he took a paper out of his poc|ket, and began to read his prote&s;tation. But he had not proceeded many minutes, when a murmur aro&s;e on every hand, increa&s;ing by degrees into a clamour; which the prolocutor was &s;o far from checking, that in a very inde|cent manner he patronized it, calling out, with &s;ome circum&s;tances of rudene&s;s, upon the bi&s;hop to de&s;i&s;t.&mdash;The old man, &s;ur|pri&s;ed with this &s;udden tumult of ill-manners, pau&s;ed in admiration at it: but pre&s;ently recovering him&s;elf, he turned to the prolo|cutor, and &s;aid, with &s;ome vehemence; "In my time I have &s;poken before two kings, and have been heard for &s;ome hours together, without interruption: here I cannot be per|mitted one quarter of an hour.&mdash;Dr. We&s;ton, I have frequently heard of you before: but I think I never &s;aw you till now. I perceive you have great wit, and great learning: God grant you may make a right u&s;e of the&s;e gifts!" Other things he &s;aid; but the&s;e are the principal. His &s;peech had its effect. The prolocutor took his paper, and &s;aid, he would read it him&s;elf. But whether he could not read it, or would not, he pre&s;ently laid it down, and called out to the bi&s;hop, "Since
<PB N="169" REF="173">you refu&s;e to di&s;pute, will you then &s;ub&s;cribe?" Upon his an&s;wering in the negative, We&s;ton artfully leads him by a train of familiar que|&s;tions into an argument; and when he thought he had rai&s;ed him to a proper pitch, he gave a &s;ign to Dr. Smith the opponent, to begin: who being prepared, immediately ri&s;es up, and in a pompous manner, prefaces the di&s;putation, and gives out the que&s;tion. When he had done, the old bi&s;hop gravely an&s;wered, "I am &s;orry, Sir, that this wor|&s;hipful audience mu&s;t be di&s;appointed in their expectation.&mdash;I have already &s;poken my mind."</P>
<P>The prolocutor ob&s;erving this, begins again in his artful manner to draw Mr. Latimer in|to an argument. Pray, &s;aid he, Sir, how long have you been in pri&s;on?&mdash;About nine months, Sir.&mdash;But I was impri&s;oned, &s;aid We&s;ton, &s;ix years.&mdash;I am heartily &s;orry for it, Sir.&mdash;I think you were once, Mr. Latimer, of our way of thinking.&mdash;I was, Sir.&mdash;I have heard too, that you have &s;aid ma&s;s in your time?&mdash;I have, Sir.&mdash;He then a&s;ked him, why he altered his opinion; and thus by de|grees, led him to an&s;wer the chief arguments brought from &s;cripture in favour of tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation.
<PB N="170" REF="174">They then began to ply him with the fathers: and fir&s;t, a pa&s;&s;age from Hillary was quoted. As he was about to an|&s;wer, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners called out to him, (on account of the populace mo&s;t pro|bably) "Mr. Latimer, &s;peak in Latin, &s;peak in Latin, I know you can do it, if you plea&s;e." But the bi&s;hop &s;aying he had the prolocutor's leave, went on in Engli&s;h, and told them, that, "As for the pa&s;&s;age from Hillary, which they had quoted, he really could not &s;ee that it made much for them; but he would an&s;wer them by another quotation from Melancthon, who &s;ays, that if the fathers had fore&s;een how much weight their authority was to have in this controver&s;y, they would have written with more caution."</P>
<P>But the opponent not being &s;atisfied with this, begs leave to reduce the words of Hil|lary into a &s;yllogi&s;tic argument, and begins thus: "Such as is the unity of our fle&s;h with Chri&s;t's fle&s;h, &s;uch, nay greater, is the unity of Chri&s;t with the Father.&mdash;But the unity of Chri&s;t's fle&s;h with our fle&s;h, is true and &s;ub|&s;tantial.&mdash;Therefore, the unity of Chri&s;t with the Father, is true and &s;ub&s;tantial.&mdash;Here he pau&s;ed, expecting that the bi&s;hop would deny
<PB N="171" REF="175">his major or his minor, as the logicians &s;peak. But in&s;tead of that, he an&s;wered gravely, "You may go on, Sir, if you plea&s;e; but, upon my word, I do not under&s;tand you."</P>
<P>The jargon of this learned doctor being &s;ilenced, others attacked him, but with equal &s;uccess. He an&s;wered their que&s;tions, as far as civility required, but none of them could engage him in any formal di&s;putation. And when proofs from the fathers were multiplied upon him, he at length told them plainly, "That &s;uch proofs had no weight with him: that the fathers, no doubt, were often de|ceived; and that he never depended upon them, but when they depended upon &s;crip|ture." "Then you are not of St. Chry&s;o&s;tom's faith, replied his antagoni&s;t, nor of St. Au&s;tin's?" "I have told you, &s;aid Mr. Lati|mer, I am not, except when they bring &s;crip|ture for. what they &s;ay."</P>
<P>Little more was &s;aid, when the prolocutor finding it was impo&s;&s;ible to urge him into a controver&s;y, ro&s;e up, and di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;em|bly, crying out to the populace, "Here you all &s;ee the weakne&s;s of here&s;y again&s;t the truth: here is a man who, adhering to his errors, hath given up the go&s;pel, and rejected
<PB N="172" REF="176">the fathers." The old bi&s;hop made no re|ply; but wrapping his gown about him, and taking up his New Te&s;tament, and his &s;taff, walked out as unconcerned, as he came in.</P>
<P>Thus he maintained to the la&s;t his re&s;olu|tion of not di&s;puting; a re&s;olution which he had not ha&s;tily taken. Mr. Addi&s;on (in his 465th &s;pectator) greatly admires his be|haviour on this occa&s;ion, though he does not a&s;&s;ign it to its true cau&s;e. "This venerable old man, &s;ays he, knowing how his abilities were impaired by age, and that it was impo&s;|&s;ible for him to recollect all tho&s;e rea&s;ons, which had directed him in the choice of his religion, left his companions, who were in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their parts and learning, to baffle and confound their antagoni&s;ts by the force of rea&s;on. As for him&s;elf, he only re|peated to his adver&s;aries the articles in which he firmly believed, and in the profe&s;&s;ion of which he was determined to die."&mdash;The truth is, he knew it would an&s;wer no end to be more explicit.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;olemn di&s;putations being thus at an end, nothing now remained but to pa&s;s &s;en|tence. On the friday following, therefore, the commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;eated in their accu&s;tomed
<PB N="173" REF="177">form, &s;ent for the three bi&s;hops to St. Mary's church: where, after &s;ome affected exhorta|tions to recant, the prolocutor fir&s;t excommu|nicated, and then condemned them. As &s;oon as the &s;entence was read, bi&s;hop Latimer lift|ing up his eyes, cried out, "I thank God mo&s;t heartily, that he hath prolonged my life to this end!" To which the prolocu|tor replied, "If you go to heaven in this faith, I am thoroughly per&s;uaded I &s;hall ne|ver get there."</P>
<P>The next day a grand proce&s;&s;ion was made, in which the ho&s;t, by way of triumph, was carried in &s;tate, under a canopy.</P>
<P>The&s;e eminent per&s;ons being thus con|victed of here&s;y, and delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, various were the opinions of men concerning them. Some thought the queen was inclined to mercy; and it was confidently reported, that the three bi&s;hops would be removed indeed from interfering publicly with religion; but that, very liberally pen&s;ioned, they &s;hould in other re&s;pects have no cau&s;e to complain: while &s;ome again as po&s;itively affirmed, their mea&s;ure would be very hard; as the queen, it was well known, would never forgive the hand
<PB N="174" REF="178">they had had in her mother's divorce, and the &s;eparation from the church of Rome. But the&s;e were only the popular conjec|tures of the time, none of them founded on truth: for the councils, which determin|ed the fates of the&s;e great men, had not yet birth.</P>

<P>QUEEN Mary, how zealous &s;oever in the cau&s;e of popery, was not yet at lei|&s;ure to attend the &s;ettlement of it. She had in general &s;chemed it; but had laid out no mea&s;ures. Civil affairs were at this time more her concern than eccle&s;ia&s;tical. The tower was full of &s;tate pri&s;oners, yet undi&s;|po&s;ed of; her title to the crown was not yet confirmed; nor her cabinet formed: a dan|gerous in&s;urrection had been moved in E&s;&s;ex; and a &s;editious &s;pirit was &s;till at work in many parts of the nation, particularly in the capi|tal, di&s;covering it&s;elf in riots and loud mur|murs. To the&s;e things the queen's marriage &s;ucceeded, as another ob&s;tacle to the imme|diate &s;ettlement of religion.</P>
<P>At length, however, an area was cleared for the &s;cene of blood about to be exhibited; and from this time, to the conclu&s;ion of the queen's reign, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery was the &s;ingle point in view; every national concern, in the mean time, both at home and abroad, being either made &s;ub&s;ervient to it, or neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180">The fir&s;t effort of the mini&s;try was to gain a parliamentary concurrence. King Edward's laws again&s;t popery were &s;till in force, and the nation of cour&s;e in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from Rome. But in tho&s;e days, when prero|gative ran high, the parliament was little more than an echo to the cabinet. The queen, therefore, found it an ea&s;y matter to arm her|&s;elf with what powers &s;he wanted. One act cancelled a whole reign; &s;tatutes again&s;t he|re&s;y were revived, and England was again prepared for the popi&s;h yoke.</P>
<P>An account of the&s;e happy events was pre|&s;ently di&s;patched to Rome, where it created the face of a jubilee. The pope laid a&s;ide his long-conceived di&s;plea&s;ure; accepted the penitent nation; and ea&s;ily con&s;ented to &s;end over cardinal Pool into England, to make up the breach, in quality of his legate.</P>
<P>Cardinal Pool, of the blood royal of Eng|land, was as much known in the world as any churchman of his time; and as generally e&s;teemed. He might have been at the head of the reformation under Henry VIII; but he cho&s;e rather to court the favours of the pope; with whom to ingratiate him&s;elf, he treated Henry, then beginning to innovate,
<PB N="177" REF="181">in a manner, which drew upon him a bill of attainder. But as Rome was the &s;ituation he cho&s;e, his exile was the le&s;s grievous. Here his influence was &s;o great, that he a&s;pired to the papacy: and he would have carried his point, if his hone&s;ty had permitted him to have en|gaged thoroughly in the intrigues of the con|clave. This di&s;appointment awaked his phi|lo&s;ophy, and he retired from the world into a mona&s;tery of Benedictines near Verona. Here he was contemplating the vanity of all earthly things, when he received a gracious letter from the queen of England, pre&s;&s;ing his return to his native country, with all a&s;|&s;urances of favour. Immediately his eyes were opened; and he found that, in&s;tead of &s;ound philo&s;ophy, he had been indulging only a reverie of melancholy. As &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, therefore, he &s;et out for England; where he was received in great form, and placed at the head of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. And, to do him ju&s;tice, he became his &s;tation. He was a great and a good man; moderate in his opini|ons, and prudent in his behaviour; and would certainly have prevented tho&s;e reproaches on his religion, which this reign occa&s;ioned, had his re&s;olution been equal to his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="182">The parliament having, with all ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s, done beyond what was expected towards the introduction of popery, and being now no longer wanted, was, at length di&s;&s;olved, about the beginning of the year 1555.</P>
<P>The cardinal immediately began to act. Calling a council therefore of bi&s;hops, he pro|po&s;ed to their con&s;ideration the &s;ettlement of religion. And when many things had been &s;aid on that &s;ubject, and &s;ome things agreed on, they fell next on the treatment of heretics. "For mv own part, &s;aid the cardinal, I think we &s;hould be content with the public re&s;tor|ation of religion; and in&s;tead of irritating our adver&s;aries by a rigorous execution of the re|vived &s;tatutes, I could wi&s;h that every bi&s;hop in his dioce&s;e would try the more winning ex|pedients of gentlene&s;s and per&s;ua&s;ion." He then urged the example of the emperor Charles V. who, by a &s;evere per&s;ecution of the Lutherans, involved him&s;elf in many dif|ficulties, and purcha&s;ed nothing but di&s;ho|nour.</P>
<P>To this the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter an&s;wered, "That, in his opinion, it was the &s;ame thing not to have a law, and not to execute one: that &s;ome blood mu&s;t be &s;hed: that he was not an advocate for a general ma&s;&s;acre: to
<PB N="179" REF="183">&s;hake the leaves, he &s;aid, was of little avail; he would have the ax laid to the root of the tree: the bi&s;hops, and mo&s;t forward preach|ers, ought certainly to die: the re&s;t were of no con&s;equence."</P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;at down, when the bi&s;hop of London, who always took his temper from Winche&s;ter, &s;tarting up, vehemently pro&s;e|cuted the &s;ame &s;ubject, and having &s;aid many things with great fiercene&s;s of language, con|cluded, with freely offering him&s;elf to be the mini&s;ter of the &s;evere&s;t mea&s;ures they could propo&s;e. "I cannot, &s;aid he, my lords, act canonically any where, but in my own dio|ce&s;e; and there I &s;hall de&s;ire no man's help or countenance. And for tho&s;e who are not in my juri&s;diction, let them only be &s;ent up to me, and lodged in any of my pri&s;ons, and when I have got them there, God do &s;o to Bonner, and more al&s;o, if one of them e&s;cape me."</P>
<P>Others &s;poke in the council, but all in the &s;ame violent &s;train. The re&s;ult was, a com|mi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued out by the cardinal, impow|ering Winche&s;ter, London, and other bi&s;hops, to try and examine heretics, agreeably to the laws which were now revived.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE rage of this per&s;ecution had now continued, yet unabated, near three quarters of a year. The archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, and the two bi&s;hops, Ridley and La|timer, were &s;till in pri&s;on, unmole&s;ted: and they who were acquainted with the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter's maxims, and knew that he had the direction of affairs, were &s;urpri&s;ed at this lenity, and at a lo&s;s for the rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this popular inquiry, it was given out, "That an over&s;ight had been committed in condemning the&s;e bi&s;hops, be|fore the &s;tatutes, on which they were con|demned, had been revived: that a commi&s;|&s;ion therefore from Rome was nece&s;&s;ary for a new trial: that this had been &s;ent for; but the delays of that court were notorious." And in part, this was fact, for they had in|deed been too ha&s;ty in condemning the three bi&s;hops. However, afterwards, the whole truth appeared, when it was found that the&s;e delays, which had been charged upon the court of Rome, were really occa&s;ioned by the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="186">It was the &s;ecret grief of that ambitious prelate, that there was one &s;till higher than him&s;elf, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The cardi|nal's hat on the head of Pool, and the pope's authority, had long been the objects of his envy. With all his &s;ubtilty and addre&s;s, there|fore, he was now &s;ecretly working the cardi|nal's ruin. He had his agents in Rome, who were throwing out hints in the conclave, that the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter wanted an a&s;&s;o|ciate of equal &s;pirit with him&s;elf; that the le|gate was not hearty in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and that his lenity to the prote&s;tants only too much &s;hewed his inclination towards them.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the time likewi&s;e fa|voured Gardiner's ambition. For he knew, that cardinal Carraffa, who had ju&s;t obtained the pontificate, had no friend&s;hip for Pool, with whom formerly he had &s;harp di&s;putes. The de&s;igning prelate, therefore, was in great hopes, that his &s;cheme would take effect; and when Pool was removed, he made no doubt but he had intere&s;t to &s;ucceed him.</P>
<P>But this was only an under part in his &s;cheme. He knew, and was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in knowing, that the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, upon the death of Cranmer, was intended for the legate.
<PB N="183" REF="187">This dignity his heart was &s;et on, of which he made him&s;elf &s;ure upon the removal of Pool. With this view he did what he could to delay the execution of Cranmer, till the legate was recalled, and his own head ready for the mitre.</P>
<P>The&s;e delays, however, at length grew no|torious, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome clamour among the warmer papi&s;ts: and Winche&s;ter finding him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed by the curio&s;ity of &s;ome, and the zeal of others, was obliged, in part at lea&s;t, to abandon his &s;cheme. It was his ori|ginal de&s;ign, as le&s;s liable to &s;u&s;picion, to have treated the three bi&s;hops in the &s;ame way. However now, to wipe off the offence that had been taken, he re&s;olved to give up Rid|ley and Latimer to their immediate fate; and to delay Cranmer's execution, by procuring a different form of proce&s;s again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The chief ob&s;tacle therefore being now re|moved, a commi&s;&s;ion &s;oon came from Rome, directed to the cardinal, who immediately named the bi&s;hops of Lincoln, Glouce&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, his commi&s;&s;ioners, to execute it.</P>
<P>The rumour of this commi&s;&s;ion &s;pread an univer&s;al alarm. For with regard to the fates of the&s;e eminent per&s;ons, the expectation of
<PB N="184" REF="188">men had now almo&s;t totally &s;ub&s;ided: and being renewed, held them doubly attentive; while the exulting papi&s;t on one &s;ide, and the de&s;ponding prote&s;tant on the other, &s;tood pre|pared to &s;ee in this &s;troke the completion of their hopes and fears.</P>
<P>Great were the preparations in the mean time at Oxford, to receive the commi&s;&s;ioners. For as this was the fir&s;t judicial act, &s;ince the re&s;toration of popery, in which the pope in|terfered, the utmo&s;t re&s;pect which the univer|&s;ity could pay, was deemed only a proper te&s;ti|mony of its zeal. The&s;e compliments being &s;ufficiently di&s;charged, on the 30th of &s;eptem|ber, 1555, the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;eating them|&s;elves in great &s;tate in the divinity-&s;chool, the two bi&s;hops were called before them. The bi&s;hop of London was fir&s;t que&s;tioned. Then bi&s;hop Latimer was brought in; to whom Lincoln, who was a polite and very eloquent man, &s;poke to this effect.</P>
<P>"This parchment, Mr. Latimer, contains a commi&s;&s;ion from my lord cardinal, under his holine&s;s, directed to me and the&s;e two reverend prelates, by which we are enjoin|ed to examine you upon &s;ome points of faith, in which your orthodoxy is doubted:
<PB N="185" REF="189">we are required to pre&s;s you to revoke your errors, if you &s;till hold the&s;e pernicious opini|ons; and to cut you off from the church, if you per&s;i&s;t, and give you up to the civil power.</P>
<P>Confider, Mr. Latimer, it is not more than twenty years, &s;ince the&s;e novel opinions got footing among&s;t us. Till then the au|thority of the church of Rome was univer|&s;ally acknowledged. By what means it was fir&s;t que&s;tioned in England; and on what un|ju&s;tifiable motives a &s;chi&s;m was occa&s;ioned, I might ea&s;ily &s;hew at large&mdash;but I &s;pare the dead. Let it &s;uffice, that the nation hav|ing long &s;ought re&s;t in a multiplicity of new inventions, and found none, hath again &s;ub|mitted it&s;elf to its mother-church; and by one unanimous act, the re&s;ult of penitence and con|trition, hath atoned for its apo&s;tacy. Why then &s;hould you oppo&s;e the unanimity of a whole people? Confe&s;s your fault, and unite your penitence with theirs. It hath been a common error, let it be a general humiliation. Among &s;uch numbers, the &s;hame of each in|dividual will be lo&s;t. Come then in peace, for we will kindly receive you into the bo&s;om of
<PB N="186" REF="190">that church, who&s;e authority, derived from the fir&s;t apo&s;tle, depends on &s;criptures, fa|thers, and councils; that church, within which there can be no error, and without which, there can be no &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Let me then, in the &s;pirit of charity, be|&s;eech you to accept this offered mercy. Let me even implore you not to reduce us to the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of cutting you off from the church; and leaving you to the vengeance of the civil power. Spare your&s;elf: accelerate not your death: con&s;ider the condition of your &s;oul: remember, it is the cau&s;e, not the death, that maketh the martyr. Hum|ble your&s;elf: captivate your under&s;tanding: &s;ubdue your rea&s;on: &s;ubmit your&s;elf to the determination of the church: and for God's &s;ake, force us not to do all we may do; but let us re&s;t in what we have done."</P>
<P>Here the bi&s;hop pau&s;ing, Mr. Latimer &s;tood up, and thanked him for his gentle treatment of him; but at the &s;ame time a&s;|&s;ured him, how vain it was to expect from him any acknowledgment of the pope. He did not believe, he &s;aid, that any &s;uch juri&s;|diction had been given to the &s;ee of Rome,
<PB N="187" REF="191">nor had the bi&s;hops of Rome behaved as if their power had been from God. He then quoted a popi&s;h book, which had lately been written, to &s;hew how gro&s;ly the papi&s;ts would mi&s;repre&s;ent &s;cripture: and concluded with &s;aying, that he thought the clergy had no|thing to do with temporal power, nor ought ever to be intru&s;ted with it: and that their commi&s;&s;ion from their ma&s;ter, in his opinion, extended no farther than to the di&s;charge of their pa&s;toral functions.</P>
<P>To this the bi&s;hop of Lincoln replied, "That he thought his &s;tile not quite &s;o de|cent as it might be; and that as to the book which he quoted, he knew nothing of it."</P>
<P>At this the old bi&s;hop &s;eemed to expre&s;s his &s;urprize, and told him, that although he did not know the author of it, yet it was written by a per&s;on of name, the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter.</P>
<P>This produced &s;ome mirth among the au|dience, as the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter &s;at then upon the bench. That prelate, finding him|&s;elf thus publicly challenged, ro&s;e up, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Latimer, paid him &s;ome compliments upon his learning, and then &s;poke in vindication of his book. But
<PB N="188" REF="192">his zeal carrying him too far, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln interrupting him, &s;aid, "We came not here, my lord, to di&s;pute with Mr. La|timer, but to take his an&s;wer to certain arti|cles, which &s;hall be propo&s;ed to him."</P>
<P>The&s;e articles were much the &s;ame as tho&s;e, on which he had been brought to di&s;pute the year before. They were accordingly read, and Mr. Latimer an&s;wered them all as he then did; at the &s;ame time prote&s;ting, which prote|&s;tation he begged might be regi&s;tered, that, not|with&s;tanding his an&s;wers to the pope's com|mi&s;&s;ioners, he by no means acknowledged the authority of the pope. The notaries having taken down his an&s;wers and prote&s;tation, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln told him, "That as far as he could, he would &s;hew lenity to him: that the an&s;wers which he had now given in, &s;hould not be prejudicial to him; but that he &s;hould be called upon the next morning, when he might make what alterations he plea&s;ed; and that he hoped in God, he would then find him in a better temper." To this the old bi&s;hop an&s;wered, "That he begged, they would do with him then ju&s;t what they plea&s;ed, and that he might not trouble them, nor they him another day; that as to his opi|nions,
<PB N="189" REF="193">he was fixed in them; and that any re&s;pite would be needle&s;s." The bi&s;hop, how|ever, told him, that he mu&s;t appear the next morning; and then di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next morning, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;itting in the &s;ame form, he was brought in: and when the tumult was com|po&s;ed, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln told him, that although he might ju&s;tly have proceeded to judgment again&s;t him the day before, e&s;pe|cially as he him&s;elf had required it; yet he could not help po&s;tponing it one day longer. "In hopes, &s;aid he, Sir, that you might rea|&s;on your&s;elf into a better way of thinking, and at length embrace, what we all &s;o much de&s;ire, that mercy, which our holy church now, for the la&s;t time, offereth to you."</P>
<P>"Alas! my lord, an&s;wered Mr. Latimer, your indulgence is to no purpo&s;e. When a man is convinced of a truth, even to deliberate is unlawful. I am fully re&s;olved again&s;t the church of Rome; and once for all, my an|&s;wer is, I never will embrace its communion. If you urge me farther, I will reply as St. Cy|prian did, on a like occa&s;ion. He &s;tood be|fore his judges, upon a charge of here&s;y: and being a&s;ked which were more probably of
<PB N="190" REF="194">the church of Chri&s;t, he and his party, who were every where de&s;pi&s;ed, or they, his judges, who were every where in e&s;teem; he an&s;wer|ed re&s;olutely, "That Chri&s;t had decided that point, when he mentioned it as a mark of his di&s;ciples, that they &s;hould take up their cro&s;s and follow him." If this then, my lords, be one of the characteri&s;tics of the Chri&s;tian church, whether &s;hall we denominate by that name, the church of Rome, which hath al|ways been a per&s;ecutor, or that &s;mall body of chri&s;tians, which is per&s;ecuted by it?"</P>
<P>"You mention, Sir, replied Lincoln, with a bad grace, your cau&s;e and St. Cyprian's to|gether: they are wholly different."</P>
<P>"No, my lord, an&s;wered the old bi&s;hop, his was the word of God, and &s;o is mine."</P>
<P>But the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, not caring to have this argument moved any farther, re|plied, "That he exceeded his commi&s;&s;ion in giving leave for any rea&s;oning or debates: that he had granted this indulgence, in hopes of its &s;ucce&s;s; but ob&s;erving a contrary effect, he would not, he &s;aid, tre&s;pa&s;s any longer upon the patience of his audience, by the&s;e unpro|fitable altercations." He proceeded, there|fore, immediately to take Mr. Latimer's final
<PB N="191" REF="195">an&s;wer to the articles; which he gave as he had done before; and accompanied with the &s;ame prote&s;tation.</P>
<P>The notaries having now clo&s;ed the books, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who through the whole of this cruel bu&s;ine&s;s, had acted with as much humanity, rather than decency, as was po&s;&s;i|ble, once more pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Latimer in a very pathetic manner to retract his opinion: but being an&s;wered by a &s;teady negative, he at length pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon him.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer then a&s;ked him, whether there laid any appeal from this judgment? "To whom, &s;aid the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, would you appeal?" "To the next general council, an&s;wered Mr. Latimer, that &s;hall be regular|ly a&s;&s;embled!" "It will be a long time, re|plied the bi&s;hop, before Europe will &s;ee &s;uch a council, as you mean." Having &s;aid this, he committed Mr. Latimer to the cu&s;tody of the mayor, and di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, likewi&s;e, &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed on the bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>The 16th of October, about a fortnight from this time, was fixed for their execu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="196">In the mean time, as it was feared this affair might occa&s;ion &s;ome di&s;turbance, the queen wrote to the lord Williams, of Thame, a po|pular nobleman in tho&s;e parts, and ordered him to arm a body of the militia, and repair immediately to Oxford.</P>
<P>The&s;e preparations, and what others were nece&s;&s;ary, being made, the la&s;t &s;cene of this tragedy was opened.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<PB N="193" REF="197">
<HEAD>SECTION XV.</HEAD>
<P>ON the north-&s;ide of the town, near Baliol-college, a &s;pot of ground was cho&s;en for the place of execution. Hither, on the &s;ix|teenth, the vice-chancellor of Oxford, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, appointed for that purpo&s;e, repaired early in the morning; and the lord Williams having drawn his guard round the place, the pri&s;oners were &s;ent for.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of London fir&s;t entered this dreadful circle, accompanied by the mayor: &s;oon after, bi&s;hop Latimer was brought in. The former was dre&s;&s;ed in his epi&s;copal ha|bit; the latter, as u&s;ual, in his pri&s;on-attire. This difference in their dre&s;s made a moving contra&s;t, and augmented the concern of the &s;pectators: the bi&s;hop of London &s;hewing what they had before been; bi&s;hop Latimer, what they were now reduced to.</P>
<P>While they &s;tood before the &s;take, about to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">epare them&s;elves for the fire, they were in|formed, they mu&s;t fir&s;t hear a &s;ermon: and &s;oon after, Dr. Smith, of whom mention hath already been made, a&s;cended a pulpit, pre|pared for that purpo&s;e, and preached on the&s;e
<PB N="194" REF="198">words of St. Paul, "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it pro|fiteth me nothing? In his di&s;cour&s;e he treat|ed the two bi&s;hops with great inhumanity; a&s;per&s;ing both their characters and tenets.</P>
<P>The &s;ermon being ended, the bi&s;hop of London was beginning to &s;ay &s;omething in defence of him&s;elf, when the vice-chancellor, &s;tarting up &s;uddenly from his &s;eat, ran to|wards him, and &s;topping his mouth with his hand, told him, "That if he was going to recant, he &s;hould have leave: but he &s;hould be permitted in nothing farther." The bi&s;hop thus checked, looking round, with a noble air, cried out, "We commit our cau&s;e then to almighty God."</P>
<P>Immediately an officer &s;tepped up, and ac|quainted them, "That at their lei&s;ure they might now make ready for the &s;take."</P>
<P>The attention of the &s;pectators at length bur&s;t into tears, when they &s;aw the&s;e two ve|nerable men now preparing for death. When they con&s;idered, as Mr. Fox ob&s;erves, their preferments, the places of honour they held in the commonwealth, the favour they &s;tood in with their princes, their great learning, and greater piety, they were overwhelmed
<PB N="195" REF="199">with &s;orrow to &s;ee &s;o much dignity, &s;o much honour, &s;o much e&s;timation, &s;o many godly virtues, the &s;tudy of &s;o many years, and &s;o much excellent learning, about to be con|&s;umed in one moment.</P>
<P>Mr. Latimer having thrown off the old gown which was wrapped about him, ap|peared in a &s;hroud, prepared for the purpo&s;e; and "whereas before, &s;ays Mr. Fox, he &s;eem|ed a withered and crooked old man, he now &s;tood bolt upright, as comely a father, as one might lightly behold."</P>
<P>Being thus ready, he recommended his &s;oul to God, and delivered him&s;elf to the ex|ecutioner; &s;aying to the bi&s;hop of London, "We &s;hall this day, my lord, light &s;uch a candle in England, as &s;hall never be extin|gui&s;hed."</P>
<P>But I will draw a veil over the conclu&s;ion of this &s;hocking &s;cene; and only add, that he went through his la&s;t &s;ufferings with that compo&s;ure, and firmne&s;s of mind, which no|thing but a &s;ound faith, and a good con&s;cience could produce.</P>
<P>Such was the life of Hugh Latimer, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; one of the leaders of that glo|rious army of martyrs, who introduced the
<PB N="196" REF="200">reformation in England. He had a happy temper; formed on the principles of chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy. Such was his chearfulne&s;s, that none of the accidents of life could di&s;compo&s;e him. Such was his fortitude, that not even the &s;evere&s;t trials could unman him. He had a collected &s;pirit, and on no occa&s;ion wanted a re&s;ource; he could retire within him&s;elf, and hold the world at defiance.</P>
<P>And as danger could not daunt, &s;o neither could ambition allure him. Though conver|&s;ant in courts, and intimate with princes, he pre&s;erved to the la&s;t, a rare in&s;tance mode|ration, his primeval plainne&s;s.</P>
<P>In his profe&s;&s;ion he was indefatigable: and that he might be&s;tow as much time as po&s;&s;ible on the active part of it, he allowed him&s;elf only tho&s;e hours for his private &s;tudies, when the bu&s;y world is at re&s;t; con&s;tantly ri&s;ing, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, by two in the morning.</P>
<P>How con&s;cientious he was in the di&s;charge of the public parts of his office, we have many examples. No man could per&s;uade more forcibly: no man could exert, on pro|per occa&s;ions, a more commanding &s;everity. The wicked, in whatever &s;tation, he rebuked with cen&s;orian dignity; and awed vice more
<PB N="197" REF="201">than the penal laws. He was not e&s;teemed a very learned man; for he cultivated only u&s;eful learning; and that, he thought, laid in a very narrow compa&s;s. He never engaged in worldly affairs, thinking that a clergyman ought to employ him&s;elf only in his profe&s;|&s;ion. Thus he lived rather a good, than what the world calls a great man. He had not tho&s;e commanding talents, which give &s;u|periority in bu&s;ine&s;s: but for hone&s;ty and &s;incerity of heart, for true &s;implicity of man|ners, for apo&s;tolic zeal in the cau&s;e of reli|gion, and for every virtue both of a public and private kind, that &s;hould adorn the life of a chri&s;tian, he was eminent and exemplary be|yond mo&s;t men of his own, or of any other time; well de&s;erving that evangelical com|mendation, "With the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, he had his conver&s;ation in the world."</P>
