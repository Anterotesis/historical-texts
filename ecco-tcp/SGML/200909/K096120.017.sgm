<HEAD>ECCLESIASTICAL TERRITORIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Papal Government.</HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to the canon law, the Pope is the &s;upreme, univer&s;al, and independent head of the church, and inve&s;ted with &s;overeignty over all Chri&s;tian communities, and every individual member thereof. He can pre&s;cribe laws to the whole world. What he does, is as if God him&s;elf had done it, he being god upon earth. All &s;overeigns mu&s;t pay homage to him. He may depo&s;e both di&s;obedient and ill-governing princes, and give their dominions to others.</P>
<P><HI>Cele&s;tin</HI> III. on the day after Ea&s;ter, in the year 1190, then in the 86th year of his age, had no &s;ooner placed the crown on the head of the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
VI. at Rome, than he kicked it off again, as a te&s;ti|mony of the power re&s;iding in the &s;overeign Pontiff, to make, and un-make Emperors at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He has a right to examine any per&s;on promoted to a kingdom, and may require an oath of allegiance from him. On the vacancy of a throne, the govern|ment devolves to him. He has the right, in all the &s;tates, to u&s;e both the temporal and &s;piritual &s;word. If a prince be remi&s;s in government, he may appoint him a colleague, or &s;ub&s;titute him another in his &s;tead. He can legitimate children born out of marriage, and thereby make them capable of &s;ucceeding to a crown, &amp;c. Such is the political &s;y&s;tem of the court of Rome; which, notwith&s;tanding its ab&s;urdity, impiety, and dan|ger, was no le&s;s impudently, than ambitiou&s;ly obtruded upon the world, and even for &s;ome ages, tyranni|cally put in practice. It is chiefly owing to the re|formation, that the&s;e corrupt maxims are, at pre&s;ent, treated by the rational part of Chri&s;tendom, with mockery and contempt, and that the Pope has lo&s;t great part of the formidable power he a&s;&s;umed. Pro|vidence, in the &s;ixteenth century, was plea&s;ed to bring about this reformation, in the per&s;on of <HI>Luther;</HI> a man who attempted, and performed, more than many emperors and kings could have compa&s;&s;ed; and, in|deed, neither equalled by any, from the apo&s;tles time, to his own, nor &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">However, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e countries, imme|diately &s;ubject to the Pope, his power is &s;till the mo&s;t ab&s;olute of all others. The authority of European monarchs, be&s;ides being limited by the fundamental laws, by the ordinances of their predece&s;&s;ors, by their coronation oath, is balanced by intermediate powers; &s;uch as the &s;tates-general, the fir&s;t bodies of the &s;tates, &amp;c. The grand &s;ignior, him&s;elf, depends as much on the Jani&s;&s;aries, as the Roman emperors depended on their army; and, the mufti, though appointed by him, and removable at plea&s;ure, is &s;o far the more formi|dable; as, if he contends with his &s;overeign, being always certain of carrying his point.</P>
<P>There is no law made, either by them&s;elves or their predece&s;&s;ors, from which the popes cannot derogate; they have only, for form's &s;ake, to declare the law, which they intend to annul; the want even of this form would not prevent the operation of a new law; it would &s;erve only to open a future pretext, or means of pleading again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Pope, remarks <HI>Puffendorf,</HI> does not, like other &s;overeigns, bind him&s;elf to any terms, on his enter|ing upon the government; and, indeed, it would be ab&s;urd for him, who is &s;aid to be guided by the Holy Gho&s;t, to be laid under any re&s;trictions.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">In mo&s;t other nations, it has been thought nece&s;&s;ary to make the crown hereditary, but this would not &s;uit the Papal government; for (as it will occa&s;ionally hap|pen in all governments) it would not have a good ap|pearance, to &s;ee the &s;upreme vicar of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> riding on a hobby-hor&s;e; or, to &s;ee the &s;upreme &s;piritual director of Chri&s;tendom, him&s;elf, going to &s;chool.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the &s;piritual forces belonging to his Holine&s;s are the cardinals; who are acknowledged princes of the church, and pretend to be next in dig|nity to crowned heads. They were, originally, no more than pari&s;h prie&s;ts of Rome, who&s;e number was, more or le&s;s, till it was fixed to &s;eventy-two, in allu|&s;ion to the di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> In ancient times, this name was common to the pre&s;byters and deacons of great churches in cities. But, in the eleventh century, the pre&s;byters, and deacons of the church of Rome, re&s;trained the appellation to them&s;elves; and, as the dignity of the Pope increa&s;ed, &s;o did theirs; the fir&s;t deacon of this affected grandeur appearing under Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> II. <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. gave them the red hat at the council of Lyons, in 1243. <HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. gave them the &s;carlet robes. From <HI>Urban</HI> VIII. the title of <HI>Eminenti&s;&s;imus;</HI> whereas, before they were only &s;tiled <HI>Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imus,</HI> in common with other bi&s;hops and prelates. The red hat is an emblem of their readi|ne&s;s to &s;hed their blood for the Catholic faith, though
<PB N="7" REF="9">
the cardinals make no great figure in the li&s;t of mar|tyrs. It is certain that, upon the whole, the &s;carlet ve&s;tment is very becoming; even the dead cardinals are painted with this colour, in order to &s;et off their cadaverous vi&s;ages.</P>
<P>The Pope holds a con&s;i&s;tory of cardinals on eccle|&s;ia&s;tical affairs; but they never intermeddle with his civil government. The Pope is cho&s;en from among the cardinals. Formerly, the bi&s;hop of Rome was cho&s;en by the clergy and people, and afterwards con|firmed by the Emperor; by whom al&s;o, he was &s;ome|times &s;u&s;pended for turbulent and &s;editious practices! <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. at the council of Ba&s;il, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> fixed their number at &s;eventy; which is &s;eldom complete. They are divided into three cla&s;&s;es: &s;ix cardinal bi&s;hops; fifty cardinal prie&s;ts; and fourteen cardinal deacons. The deans of the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es are called their chiefs. Each of the cardinal-prie&s;ts and deacons, bears the title of a church, in the city of Rome. The cardinals in&s;i&s;t on the precedence before the Electors of the Empire, and require to be treated on the &s;ame footing as crowned heads. The title of cardinal has no revenue annexed to it; but emba&s;&s;ies, protections of Roman Catholic nations, governments, arch|bi&s;hoprics, bi&s;hoprics, prelacies, and other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices, enable them to live in &s;tate, though not &s;uitably to the rank they a&s;&s;ume; more e&s;pecially
<PB N="8" REF="10">
when, being of mean extraction, they have no fortune of their own. The&s;e cardinals are from all nations; but the majority are always Italians, that the chair may not be removed from Rome, as it was once to Avignon, by <HI>Clement</HI> V.</P>
<P>The conclave is the theatre on which the cardinals chiefly endeavour to give proofs of their genius and addre&s;s: and many are the tran&s;actions there, which can hardly be thought to proceed from the in&s;pira|tion of the Holy Gho&s;t. The decea&s;e of the Pope is made known to the people of Rome, by tolling the great bell of the capitol, firing the cannon of the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and opening the pri&s;ons; and, to foreign cardinals, by circular letters from the Cardinal <HI>Cammerlingo;</HI> who invites them to the approaching cocnlave. Till &s;uch time as the conclave meet, the <HI>Cammerlingo</HI> acts as regent; is attended with the Pope's life-guard, and orders all things nece&s;&s;ary for the opening of the conclave, which is held in the gal|leries, and &s;ome of the antichambers of the Vatican, and con&s;i&s;ts of a number of &s;mall rooms, &s;eparated by wooden partitions, and di&s;tributed by lot, both among the cardinals then at Rome, and tho&s;e that are ab&s;ent. Each u&s;ually has two; one for him&s;elf, and one for his conclavi&s;ts, or two attendants. On the eleventh day, after the Pope's decea&s;e, all the cardinals in the city meet in the morning in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, where
<PB N="9" REF="11">
the ma&s;s <HI>&s;ancti &s;piritus</HI> is celebrated; and, after a &s;er|mon on the duties to be ob&s;erved, in the election of a Pope, they proceed two by two into the conclave, which is then &s;hut up by the governor and mar&s;hal, none being let out, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of illne&s;s, till a new Pope is elected; and the per&s;on &s;o let out, is not allowed to return. The governor of the conclave is always previou&s;ly cho&s;en by the cardinals; and, to|gether with the mar&s;hal, re&s;ides at the entrance of the Vatican. Without their expre&s;s licence, no per&s;on is &s;uffered to go in or out. Whil&s;t the cardinals &s;it in conclave, refre&s;hments are brought to them in ba&s;kets, or boxes, which are &s;earched, though not with much &s;trictne&s;s. Every conclave is &s;aid to &s;tand the apo&s;|tolic chamber, in two thou&s;and, or, according to &s;ome, in three thou&s;and crowns. Each cardinal orders his conclavi&s;t to write down, on a &s;lip of paper, the name of the per&s;on to whom he gives his &s;uffrage for being elected Pope. This is thrown into a chalice, on the altar of the chapel of the conclave, &s;o called from <HI>Sixtus</HI> IV. Two cardinals, appointed for that pur|po&s;e, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively read aloud the notes, marking the number of votes for every cardinal. He, who has two-thirds, is declared Pope, otherwi&s;e the &s;crutiny is repeated till this number is complete. If this manner of election does not take place, recour&s;e is had to another, called <HI>acce&s;&s;us,</HI> whereby the notes of the ormer &s;crutiny being &s;et a&s;ide, every cardinal mu&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="12">
give, in writing, his vote to another; and, if by this way two-thirds do not appear, there is &s;till another re|&s;ource, called <HI>in&s;piratio;</HI> in virtue of which, &s;uch of the cardinals, as are unanimous, come out of their cells, and call aloud to each other; <HI>&s;uch a one &s;hall be Pope! Such a one &s;hall be Pope!</HI> Upon which others, to avoid incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the new-elected Pope, join in the cry; and thus the election is car|ried. If this al&s;o fails, the &s;crutiny begins anew; and a conclave in this manner &s;ometimes proves a very tedious bu&s;ine&s;s. The Emperors, France and Spain, are allowed to exclude a per&s;on propo&s;ed for the popedom: but this prote&s;t mu&s;t be made before the complete declaration of the votes for &s;uch a per|&s;on. It is required, that the Pope be an Italian, and at lea&s;t fifty-five years of age; though the age, mo&s;t in|&s;i&s;ted upon, is between &s;ixty and &s;eventy. When the election is over, and the Pope has declared what name he will bear for the future, the chief of the cardinal-deacons proclaims him to the people; of which, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, great multitudes &s;tand expecting, in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s place. His coronation, with a triple crown, is generally performed eight days after.</P>
<P>The con&s;i&s;tory of cardinals is the Pope's high coun|cil. Its ordinary meeting is once a week, in the papal palace; but, the extraordinary depends on his Holine&s;s's plea&s;ure. Here are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all affairs,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
both &s;piritual and temporal, of the papal &s;ee; &s;uch as filling up vacant archbi&s;hoprics, bi&s;hoprics, prelacies, abbies, &amp;c. Every nation of the Roman church has a cardinal for its protector. The inferior colleges are called congregations, as the congregation of the &s;acred office or inqui&s;ition; the congregation <HI>de pro|paganda fide,</HI> and tho&s;e of religious ceremonies, and the examination of candidates for eccle&s;ia&s;tical bene|fices. The cardinals pre&s;ide in the&s;e congregations. The <HI>Rota Romano</HI> is a kind of &s;upreme court of judi|cature, or appeal in civil cau&s;es, where every Roman Catholic nation has one or two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Collations to eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, di&s;pen&s;ations, &amp;c. are made out in the <HI>datary</HI> (chancery) &s;o called from the u&s;ual &s;ignature <HI>Datum Romoe apud Sanctum Petrum,</HI> &amp;c. when the Pope is at the Vatican; but, if he is at the Quirinal palace, <HI>apud &s;anctam Mariam majorem.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;ulta takes cogni&s;ance of the complaints of the people again&s;t the governors, and of appeals from their &s;entences. All cities, tho&s;e excepted which have legates, &s;end their malefactors to Rome, where they are tried. In both criminal and civil proce&s;&s;es, a re|hearing may be obtained; and, after that, recour&s;e had to the Pope; by this, puni&s;hment falls only on &s;uch forlorn wretches as are de&s;titute of all kind of protection; and executions are as rare as crimes are frequent. Be&s;ides, the greate&s;t malefactors often
<PB N="12" REF="14">
e&s;cape by means of the a&s;ylums, who&s;e ancient privi|leges &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The corporal puni&s;hments are the &s;trapado, gallies, gibbet, and knocking down. The la&s;t is inflicted in this manner: the executioner &s;trikes the culprit on one of his temples with a club, &s;o that he drops down &s;en&s;ele&s;s, he then cuts his throat, and quarters his body, which is hung up on gibbets at the place of execution. This puni&s;hment may be le&s;s painful to the criminal than the wheel, but it is more &s;hocking to the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that it is now above a century &s;ince any per&s;on has been put to death by the inqui&s;ition. Every thing here is tran&s;acted in pri|vate, by &s;piritual and pecuniary penalties. None undergo public puni&s;hment, but bla&s;phemers, and tho&s;e picked out from among the refu&s;e of the people.</P>
<P>When a memorial, or petition is delivered to the Pope, and returned with <HI>Lectum,</HI> or read, written on it, this is anill omen; and indicates, that it has, in|deed, been read; but, at lea&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, will not be granted; the &s;oftening a denial in this manner has &s;ome affinity with the phra&s;e u&s;ed by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of France; <HI>Nous verrons,</HI> "We'll &s;ee!"</P>
<P>For preventing all di&s;orders and tumults, there is, at Rome, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> a corps of three hundred &s;birri,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
commanded by a captain, who is called <HI>Il Barigello;</HI> he is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by a chain and medal; and, when he has a mind to be known, he wears the chain about his neck. The high police, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> is in the department of Rome; who, with &s;ome a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, judges without appeal. The apo&s;tolic chamber allows him a thou&s;and &s;birri, according to this writer, five hun|dred fort watchmen, and three hundred &s;pies, who daily report to him what is doing in Rome. By the&s;e arrange|ments, the police has long &s;ince been on a very good footing at Rome; it has an eye to every thing, without &s;hewing it&s;elf, or being felt. The &s;birri are not in any great e&s;teem; they, however, keep the populace in awe, and that &s;uffices; people of credit &s;eldom having any thing to do with the police.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a police of health, to whom report is made of every creature dying at Rome, men, women, and bea&s;ts, down to the very cats. The office, in con|&s;ideration of a &s;ettled fee, has the bodies removed, and takes care that they are put under ground. The mo&s;t fle&s;hy parts of dead hor&s;es, who&s;e di&s;temper is not contagious, are left to <HI>fachini,</HI> or porters, who di&s;tribute them about as a dinner for cats; a creature of which the people of Rome are very fond; but, for whom the frugality of their tables does not provide a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. This di&s;tribution is really &s;omething en|tertaining; the <HI>fachino,</HI> attended by two ma&s;tiffs, has
<PB N="14" REF="16">
a large knife in his hand, and on one of his &s;houlders a &s;tick; from the two ends of which hang the &s;urloins of hor&s;es, which he keeps in balance, by alternately turning the &s;tick from one &s;houlder to the other: the cats, on hearing the di&s;tributors, in&s;tantly &s;hew them|&s;elves at the windows, in the gutters, and at the doors, according as their dinner is near, or at &s;ome di&s;tance. I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> five or &s;ix very fine &s;leek cats, regularly drawn up at the doors of &s;everal hou&s;es, waiting for, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively receiving, their allowance, without any quarrel, di&s;order, or confu&s;ion; tho&s;e of the following hou&s;es came out into the &s;treets; and the more bold ones came about the purveyor's legs, and tho&s;e of his dogs, who do not &s;eem di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e care&s;&s;es. This di&s;tribution is made daily, and at a &s;ettled rate.</P>
<P>The Pope, at certain times, performs ma&s;s him&s;elf at St <HI>Peter</HI>'s, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. I hap|pened lately, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to be at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, when there was &s;carcely any body there. While I lounged from chapel to chapel, looking at the &s;culpture and paintings, the Pope entered, with a very few at|tendants; when he came to the &s;tatue of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> he was not &s;atisfied with bowing, the u&s;ual mark of re&s;pect &s;hewn to that image; or with kneeling, which is performed by more zealous per&s;ons; or with ki&s;&s;ing the foot, which generally concludes the climax
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of devotion; he bowed, he knelt, he ki&s;&s;ed the foot, and then he rubbed the forehead, and temples, with every mark of humility, fervour and adoration, upon the &s;acred &s;tump; for it is no more, one half of the foot having been long &s;ince worn away by the lips of the pious; and if the example of his Holine&s;s is univer&s;ally imitated, nothing but a miracle can pre|vent the leg, thigh, and other parts from meeting the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>The manner in which the generality of &s;overeign princes pa&s;s their time is far from being amu&s;ing, or agreeable. Slaves to the tire&s;ome routine of etiquette, and martyrs to the oppre&s;&s;ive fatigue of pomp, they are con&s;trained to walk, every levee day, around the &s;ame dull circle, to gratify the vanity of fifty, or a hundred people, by whi&s;pering a &s;omething, or a no|thing, into the ears of each. They are obliged to wear a &s;miling countenance, even when their hearts are oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;adne&s;s. Be&s;ieged by the craving faces of tho&s;e who are more di&s;plea&s;ed at what is with|held than grateful for the favours that have been granted; and &s;urrounded by adepts in the art of &s;imu|lation, how can they be free from a&s;&s;umed attach|ments? And what ri&s;k do they run of placing their confidence, where they ought to have directed their indignation? If we add to all the&s;e inconveniences that they are precluded from tho&s;e delightful &s;en&s;a|tions
<PB N="16" REF="18">
ari&s;ing from di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, &s;weet equality, and the gay carele&s;s enjoyments of &s;ocial life? We mu&s;t acknowledge that all that is brilliant, in their exalted &s;tations, is not &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate for &s;uch re&s;traints, and &s;uch deprivations.</P>
<P>So far are we indeed from con&s;idering that condi|tion as enviable, great part of mankind are more apt to think it in&s;upportable; and are &s;urprized to find that tho&s;e unhappy men, whom fate has con|demned to &s;uffer the pains of royalty for life, are able to wait with patience for the natural period of their days. But, &s;trange as it may appear, hi&s;tory does not furni&s;h us with one in&s;tance, not even in Great Bri|tain, of a king who hanged, or drowned, or put him&s;elf to death in any violent manner. The &s;torms, to which people in their exalted &s;ituation are expo&s;ed, occa&s;ion &s;uch agitations, as prevent the &s;tag|nating &s;lime of taedium from gathering on their minds. That kings do not commit &s;uicide, therefore, is but a very &s;lender pre&s;umption of the happine&s;s of their condition; although it is a &s;trong proof that all the hurricanes of life are not &s;o un&s;upportable to the hu|man mind, as that in&s;ipid, fearle&s;s, hopele&s;s calm, which envelops men, who are devoid of mental en|joyments, and who&s;e &s;en&s;es are palled with &s;atiety.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">There are pa&s;&s;ions who&s;e indulgence is &s;o flatter|ing to the vanity of men, that they will gratify them, though per&s;uaded that their gratification will be at|tended with di&s;appointment and mi&s;ery. The love of power and &s;overeignty is of this cla&s;s. It has been a general belief, ever &s;ince the kingly office was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed among men, that cares and anxiety were the con&s;tant attendants on royalty. Yet this general con|viction never made a &s;ingle per&s;on decline an oppor|tunity of embarking on this &s;ea of troubles. Every new adventurer flatters him&s;elf that he &s;hall be guided by &s;ome happy &s;tar, undi&s;covered by former navi|gators; and tho&s;e, who after trial have relinqui&s;hed the voyage, like <HI>Charles</HI> V. <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> Queen of Swe|den, <HI>Amadoeus,</HI> and others, when they had quitted the helm, and were &s;afely arrived in port, are &s;aid to have langui&s;hed all the re&s;t of their lives, for that &s;ituation, which their own experience taught them was fraught with mi&s;ery.</P>

This appears the more wonderful when we re|flect that, over and above tho&s;e &s;ources of wearine&s;s and vexation, which the Pope has in common with other &s;overeigns, he has &s;ome which are peculiar to him&s;elf: &s;uch as the tire&s;ome religious functions he mu&s;t perform, the congenial &s;olitude of his meals, ex|clu&s;ive of the conver&s;ation and company of women; re&s;triction from the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delightful con|nexions in life, from the endearments of a parent, and the open acknwledgment of his own children; his mind oppre&s;&s;ed with the gloomy reflection that the man for whom he has the lea&s;t regard, perhaps his greate&s;t enemy, may be his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or; to which is added the pain of &s;eeing his influence, both &s;piritual and temporal, declining every day; and the mortification of knowing that all his ancient lofty pre|ten&s;ions are laughed at, by one half of the Roman Catholics, all the Prote&s;tants, and totally di&s;regarded by the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>All popes, however, remarks <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> have not been &s;laves to the trouble&s;ome ceremonials of their &s;tation. <HI>Leo</HI> X. and <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. found means to &s;hake the&s;e off. <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. though ranked by the Ro|mans among the &s;aints, during the greater part of his Pontificate, &s;muggled him&s;elf from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;olemnities. A cold, or a defluxion, often &s;tood him in good &s;tead, on the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible occa&s;ions.
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Ever invi&s;ible, he governed his dominions as God governs the world. His melancholy ca&s;t, and the au&s;terity of his temper, infecting all about him, &s;pread a gloom in which Rome was involved, during his Pontificate.</P>
<P><HI>Benedict</HI> XIV. had excluded the ceremonials of of|fice, from a little apartment he erected in the gardens of Monte Cavallo; here he generally retired after dinner to drink his coffee; and, with his mo&s;t inti|mate friends, and &s;ome &s;elect foreigners, would &s;acri-to mirth and humour, as if he had been only a private individual. His excur&s;ions into Rome were gene|rally on foot, with a large cane in his hand; and &s;o far from confining him&s;elf to tho&s;e &s;treets where &s;and is &s;trewed every day, through which the Pope is &s;up|po&s;ed to pa&s;s, he would go into little bye &s;treets, where pope was never before &s;een; he has even, more than once, &s;topped at the door of a public-hou&s;e, where people were making merry, and would &s;ay to his u&s;ual attendant, "I warrant you, Mon&s;ignor, there is rare wine here."</P>
<P>Of all the popes, the mo&s;t liberal in this way of thinking, was the famous <HI>Ganganelli.</HI> He re&s;trained the malevolence of bigots, removed ab&s;urd prejudices, and promoted &s;entiments of charity, and good-will to mankind, without excepting even heretics. His ene|mies,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
the Je&s;uits, with an intention to render him odious, gave him the name of the Prote&s;tant Pope. If they &s;uppo&s;ed this calumny would be credited, on account of that conduct of his, which they condemned, they at once paid the highe&s;t compliment to the Pope, and the prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>Among many anecdotes of <HI>Ganganelli's</HI> goodne&s;s of heart, the following is one. A Scotch pre&s;by|terian, having heated his brain by reading <HI>Fox</HI>'s book of Martyrs, and the history of the per&s;ecutions that were rai&s;ed again&s;t the prote&s;tants, was &s;eized with a dread that the &s;ame horrors were going to be re|newed. This terrible idea di&s;turbed his imagination, day and night; he thought of nothing but racks and &s;caffolds; and, on one occa&s;ion, dreamt there was a continued train of bonfires, all the way from Smith|field to St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> with a tar-barrel and a prote&s;tant in each. He communicated his anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s of mind to a worthy clergyman, who lived in the neighbourhood. This gentleman took great pains to quiet him, by proving that there was no danger of &s;uch an event as he dreaded. The&s;e rea&s;onings had a powerful effect, for a while; but were always ef|faced by a fre&s;h peru&s;al of the book of Martyrs. As &s;oon as the clergyman remarked this, he advi&s;ed his relations to remove that, and every other book, which treated of per&s;ecution and martyrdom, out of the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
poor man's reach. They did &s;o, and books of a le&s;s gloomy complexion were &s;ub&s;tituted in their place; but, as they all formed a &s;trong contra&s;t to the colour of his mind, he could not bear the peru&s;al of them; but betook him&s;elf entirely to the &s;tudy of the bible; which was the only book of his ancient library that had been left him; and &s;o &s;trong a hold had his former &s;tudies taken of his imagination, that he could bear peru&s;ing no part of the bible, except the Reve|lations of St. <HI>John;</HI> a great part of which he thought referred to the Pope of Rome, under the denomina|tion of the Whore of Babylon. This part of the &s;cripture he peru&s;ed, continually, with unabated ar|dour and delight. His friend, the clergyman, ob|&s;erving this, took occa&s;ion to tell him, that every part of the bible was no doubt mo&s;t &s;ublime, and in&s;truc|tive; but he wondered to &s;ee that he limited his &s;tudies entirely to the la&s;t book, and neglected all the re&s;t. To which the other replied, that he who was a divine, and a man of learning, might, with propriety, read the whole of the bible, from beginning to end; but that, for his part, he thought proper to confine him&s;elf to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages he could under&s;tand; and therefore, though he entertained a great veneration for the whole of the &s;acred &s;criptures, he gave a pre|ference to the Revelations. This reply &s;atisfied the clergyman; he did not think it expedient to que&s;tion him any farther, but took his leave; after having re|commended
<PB N="22" REF="24">
his relations to have a watchful eye over him. In the mean time this poor man's terrors daily augmented; and his &s;hattered frame would, in all probability, have &s;unk under the accumulated weight of &s;o much anxiety, had not a thought occurred to him which relieved his mind in an in&s;tant. This was no other than to go immediately to Rome, and con|vert the Pope. The moment he hit on this expedi|ent, he felt the &s;tronge&s;t impul&s;e to undertake the ta&s;k, and the fulle&s;t conviction that his labours would be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; it is no wonder therefore that his countenance threw off its former gloom, and his features brightened with the heart-felt thrillings of happine&s;s and &s;elf-applau&s;e. While his relations were congratulating each other, on this agreeable change, the exulting vi&s;ionary, without communicating his de|&s;ign to any one, &s;et out for London, took his pa&s;&s;age for Leghorn, and, in a &s;hort time after, arrived at Rome.</P>
<P>He directly applied to an eccle&s;ia&s;tic of his own country, of who&s;e obliging di&s;po&s;ition he had been previou&s;ly informed. He told this gentleman he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to have a conference with the Pope, on a bu&s;ine&s;s of importance; and which admitted no delay. It was not difficult to perceive the &s;tate of this poor man's mind; and the good natured eccle|&s;ia&s;tic endeavoured to &s;oothe and amu&s;e him, by
<PB N="23" REF="25">
putting off the conference to a di&s;tant day; in hopes that means might be fallen upon, during the interval, to prevail on him to return to his own country. A few days after, however, he happened to go to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, at the time his Holine&s;s was perform|ing &s;ome religious ceremony. At this &s;ight our im|petuous mi&s;&s;ionary felt all his pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with irre&s;i&s;tible ardour; he could no longer wait the ex|pected conference; but, bur&s;ting out with fiery in|dignation, he exclaimed, "O thou bea&s;t of nature, with &s;even heads and ten horns! thou mother of har|lots, arrayed in purple and &s;carlet, and decked with gold and precious &s;tones! throw away thy golden cup of abomination, and the filth of thy fornication." It may ea&s;ily be imagined the a&s;toni&s;hment and hub|bub that &s;uch an apo&s;trophe, from &s;uch a pious per|&s;on, mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned; he was immediately laid hold of, by the Swi&s;s halberdiers, and conveyed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>When it was known he was a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, &s;ome who under&s;tood Engli&s;h were ordered to attend his examination. The fir&s;t que&s;tion a&s;ked of him was, "What had brought him to Rome?" He an&s;wered, "To anoint the eyes of the &s;carlet whore with eye-&s;alve, that &s;he might &s;ee her wickedne&s;s." They a&s;ked him, "Who he meant by the &s;carlet whore?" He an&s;wered, "Who el&s;e could he mean, but her
<PB N="24" REF="26">
who &s;itteth upon &s;even mountains, who hath &s;educed the kings of the earth to commit fornication; and who hath gotten drunk with the blood of the &s;aints and mar|tyrs." Many more que&s;tions were a&s;ked, and &s;uch provoking an&s;wers returned, that &s;ome thought he af|fected madne&s;s, to give vent to his rancour and petu|lance with impunity; and they were for having him condemned to the gallies, to be taught more &s;en&s;e and better manners. But when they communicated their &s;entiments to <HI>Ganganelli,</HI> he &s;aid, with great good hu|mour, "That he had never heard of any per&s;on who&s;e under&s;tanding, or who&s;e morals, had been much im|proved in that &s;chool; that although the poor man's fir&s;t addre&s;s had been a little abrupt and rough, yet he could not but con&s;ider him&s;elf as obliged to him for his good intentions; and for undertaking &s;o long a journey, with a view of doing good." He afterwards gave orders that the man &s;hould be treated with gentlene&s;s, while he remained in confinement, and to put him on board the fir&s;t &s;hip, bound from Civita Vecchia to England, defraying the expence of his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>However humane and rea&s;onable this conduct may be thought by many, there were people who con|demned it as injudicious lenity, which might have a tendency to le&s;&s;en the dignity of the &s;acred office, and expo&s;e it to future in&s;ults. If &s;uch behaviour as this
<PB N="25" REF="27">
did not pa&s;s without blame, it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that few of <HI>Ganganelli</HI>'s actions e&s;caped uncen&s;ured; and many who loved the ea&s;y amiable di&s;po&s;ition of the man, were of opinion that the &s;pirit of the times required a different character in the Papal throne. This idea prevailed among the cardinals at the next election, and the conclave is &s;uppo&s;ed to have fixed on his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, from the &s;ame motive that the Roman &s;enate &s;ometimes cho&s;e a dictator, to enforce the an|cient di&s;cipline.</P>

<P>TRAVELLERS, remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> are too apt to form ha&s;ty, and, for the mo&s;t part, unfavour|able opinions of national characters. Finding the cu&s;|toms and &s;entiments of the inhabitants of foreign coun|tries, through which they pa&s;s, very different from their own, they are ready to con&s;ider them as erroneous; and conclude that tho&s;e who act, and think, in a man|ner &s;o oppo&s;ite to them&s;elves, mu&s;t be either knaves,
<PB N="26" REF="28">
fools, or both. In &s;uch ha&s;ty deci&s;ions they are often confirmed by the partial repre&s;entations of a few of their own countrymen; or of other foreigners who are e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome profe&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e countries; and who have an intere&s;t in giving bad impre&s;&s;ions of the people, among whom they re&s;ide.</P>
<P>That the Italians have a great &s;hare of natural &s;a|gacity, and acutene&s;s, is pretty generally allowed; but they are accu&s;ed of being deceitful, perfidious, and revengeful; and the frequent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and mur|ders, which happen in the great towns of Italy, are brought as proofs of this charge. I have not, &s;ays the above writer, remained a &s;ufficient length of time in this country, &s;uppo&s;ing I were, in all other re&s;pects, qualified to decide on the character of the inhabitants; but, from the opportunities I have had, my idea of the Italians is, that they are an ingenious, &s;ober peo|ple, with quick feelings, and therefore irritable; but, when unprovoked, of a mild and obliging di&s;po&s;ition; and le&s;s &s;ubject to avarice, envy, or repining at the narrowne&s;s of their own circum&s;tances, and the com|parative wealth of others, than mo&s;t nations. The murders, which occa&s;ionally happen, proceed from a deplorable want of police; and &s;ome very impo|litic cu&s;toms, which have, from various cau&s;es, crept among them; and would produce more frequent ex|amples of the &s;ame kind, if they prevailed to the &s;ame
<PB N="27" REF="29">
degree, in &s;ome other countries. But, however, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations which di&s;grace Italy, whatever may have been the ca&s;e formerly, are now entirely confined to the accidental &s;quabbles which occur among the rabble. No &s;uch thing has been known for many years pa&s;t, among people of condition, or the middle rank of ci|tizens; and, with regard to the &s;tabbings which hap|pen among the vulgar, they, almo&s;t always, proceed from an immediate impul&s;e of wrath; and are &s;eldom the effect of previous malice, or a premeditated plan of revenge. Whether the &s;tories we have of merce|nary bravos, men who formerly are &s;uppo&s;ed to have made it their profe&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, and live by the murders they committed, be founded in truth, is mere conjecture; but this is certain, that at pre&s;ent there is no &s;uch traffic going forward. That the horrid prac|tice of drawing the knife, and &s;tabbing each other, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the Italian vulgar, is owing to the &s;candalous impunity with which it is treated. The a&s;ylum, which churches and convents offer to crimi|minals, operates again&s;t the peace of &s;ociety; and tends to the encouragement of this &s;hocking cu&s;tom, in two different manners. Fir&s;t, by increa&s;ing the criminal's hope of e&s;caping; and &s;econdly, by dimi|ni&s;hing, in vulgar minds, the atrocity of the crime. When the populace &s;ee a murderer lodged within the &s;acred walls of a church, protected and fed by men who are revered on account of their profe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
and the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity of their lives, mu&s;t not this weaken the horror, which mankind naturally have for &s;uch a crime; and which it ought to be the aim of every government to augment?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are willing to admit that this la&s;t con&s;i|deration may have the effect a&s;cribed to it, on the minds of the vulgar, &s;till contend that the hopes of impunity can have little influence in keeping up the practice of &s;tabbing; becau&s;e, as has been already ob|&s;erved, the&s;e &s;tabbings are always in con&s;equence of accidental quarrels, and &s;udden bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, in which men have no con&s;ideration about their future &s;afety. In an&s;wer to this, it may be ob&s;erved, there are certain con&s;iderations, which never entirely leave their influence on the minds of men; even when they are in the height of pa&s;&s;ion. We every day &s;ee men who have the character of being of the mo&s;t ungovern|able tempers, who are apt to fly into violent fits of pa&s;&s;ion, upon the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions, yet, in the mid&s;t of all their rage, and when they &s;eem to be en|tirely blinded by fury, are &s;till capable of making di&s;|tinctions; which plainly evince they are not &s;o much blindfolded by anger, as they would &s;eem to be. When people are &s;ubject to violent fits of choler, and to an unre&s;trained licence of words and actions, only in the company of tho&s;e who, from their unfortunate &s;ituation in life, are obliged to bear &s;uch abu&s;e, it
<PB N="29" REF="31">
is a plain proof that con&s;iderations, which regard their own per&s;onal &s;afety, have &s;ome influence on their minds, in the mid&s;t of their fury, and in&s;truct them to be mad, <HI>certa ratione modoque.</HI> This is fre|quently unknown to tho&s;e choleric people them&s;elves, whil&s;t it is fully evident to every per&s;on around them. In what violent fits of pa&s;&s;ion do men indulge them|&s;elves, again&s;t their &s;laves and &s;ervants; imputing their rage to the ungovernable nature of their tem|pers; of which, however, they have the mo&s;t perfect command, on much greater provocations given them by their &s;uperiors, equals, or by any &s;et of people not obliged to bear their ill-humours? How often do we &s;ee men, agreeable, chearful, polite and good tem|pered in public; yet gloomy, peevi&s;h, and pa&s;&s;ionate to their wives and children? Should you happen to be witne&s;s to any in&s;tance of unprovoked rage, they will, probably, lament their misfortune, in having tempers more ungovernable than the re&s;t of mankind. But if a man, when provoked, does not &s;peak and act with the &s;ame degree of violence, without con&s;idering whether it comes from a &s;uperior, equal, or dependent, he plainly &s;hews he can govern his temper; and that his not doing it, on particular occa&s;ions, proceeds from the ba&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t de&s;picable of all motives.</P>
<P>I remember, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> when I was on the conti|nent, with the Engli&s;h army, having &s;een an officer
<PB N="30" REF="32">
beat a &s;oldier, very unmercifully, with his cane; I was then &s;tanding with &s;ome officers, all of whom &s;eemed to be filled with indignation at this mean ex|erci&s;e of power. When the per&s;on, who had per|formed the intrepid exploit, came to join the circle, he plainly perceived marks of di&s;approbation in every countenance; for which rea&s;on he thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to apologize for what he had done, "Nothing," &s;ays he, "provokes me &s;o much, as a fellow's looking &s;aucily when I &s;peak to him. I have told that man &s;o fifty times; and yet, on my reprimanding him ju&s;t now, for having one of the buttons of his wai&s;tcoat broken, he looked &s;aucily full in my face; which put me in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion that I could not help &s;triking him&mdash;However, I am &s;orry for it, becau&s;e he has the character of being an hone&s;t man, and has always done his duty as a &s;oldier very well." "How much," continued he, "are tho&s;e people to be envied, who have full command of their temper."</P>
<P>"No man can command it better than your&s;elf," &s;aid a gentleman who was there, in the foot-guards, and has &s;ince been made a General Officer.</P>
<P>"I often endeavour to do it," replied the choleric man, "but always find it out of my power. I have not philo&s;ophy enough to check the violence of my temper, when once I am provoked."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">"You certainly do your&s;elf inju&s;tice, Sir," &s;aid the officer, "no per&s;on &s;eeming to have his pa&s;&s;ions under better di&s;cipline. With your brother officers, I never &s;aw you, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, break through the rules of decorum, or allow your anger to over|come your politene&s;s to them."</P>
<P>"They never provoked me," &s;aid the pa&s;&s;ionate man.</P>
<P>"Never provoked you," rejoined the other, "yes, Sir, frequently, and in a much greater degree, than the poor &s;oldier has done. Do not I, at this moment, give you ten thou&s;and times more provocations than he, or any of the unfortunate men under your com|mand, whom you are &s;o apt to beat and abu&s;e, and yet you &s;eem perfectly ma&s;ter of your temper?"</P>
<P>There was no way left by which the choleric man could prove the contrary, except by knocking the other down; but this was a method of convincing his antagoni&s;t, which he did not think proper to u&s;e. A more intrepid man, in the &s;ame predicament, would, very probably, have had recour&s;e to that expedient; but, in general, mankind are able, even in the vio|lence of pa&s;&s;ion, to e&s;timate, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the ri&s;k they run; and the populace, of every country, are more readily kindled to that inferior degree of rage,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
which makes them lo&s;e their horror for the crime of murder; than to that higher pitch, which deprives them of all con&s;ideration for their per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>In England, and Germany, a man knows, that if he commits a murder, every per&s;on around him will, from that in&s;tant, become his enemy; and u&s;e every means to lay hold of him, and bring him to ju&s;tice. He knows he will be immediately carried to pri&s;on, and put to an ignominious death, amid&s;t the exe|crations of his countrymen. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, the populace of the&s;e countries hardly ever have recour&s;e to &s;tabbing, in their quarrels; however they may be inflamed with anger and rage. The lowe&s;t blackguard, in the &s;treets of London, will not draw a knife again&s;t an antagoni&s;t, far &s;uperior to to him&s;elf in &s;trength. He will fight him fairly with his fi&s;ts as long as he can, and bear the &s;evere&s;t drub|bing, rather than u&s;e a means of defence held in de|te&s;tation by his countrymen, and which would infal|libly bring him to the gallows.</P>
<P>The murders committed in Germany, or England, are therefore, comparatively, few in number, and hap|pen, generally, in con&s;equence of a pre-concerted plan, in which the murderers have taken mea&s;ures for their e&s;cape, or concealment. In Italy, remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> the ca&s;e is different; an Italian is not under
<PB N="33" REF="35">
the influence of &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion; he is not certain that execution mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of his committing a murder; he is therefore at le&s;s pains to re&s;train the wrath he feels kindling within his brea&s;t; and if hard pre&s;&s;ed, by the &s;uperior &s;trength of an enemy, he does not &s;cruple to extricate him&s;elf by the thru&s;t of a knife; he knows, if &s;ome of the &s;birri are not pre&s;ent, no other per&s;on will &s;eize him. The murderer therefore is pretty certain of getting to &s;ome church, or convent, where he will be protected, till he can compound the matter with the relations of the decea&s;ed; or e&s;cape to &s;ome other Italian &s;tate. Be|&s;ides, when any of the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins have not had the good fortune to get within the portico of a church, before he is &s;eized by the &s;birri, and when he is actu|ally carried to pri&s;on, it is not a very difficult mat|ter for his friends, or relations, to prevail, by their entreaties and tears, on &s;ome of the cardinals, or princes, to interfere in his favour, and endeavour to obtain his pardon.</P>
<P>Thefts, and crimes which are not capital, are pu|ni&s;hed at Rome, and &s;ome other countries in Italy, by impri&s;onment; or, what is called the cord. This la&s;t is performed in the &s;treet. The culprit's hands are bound behind by a cord, which runs on a pulley; he is then drawn up twenty or thirty feet from the ground; and, if lenity is intended, he is let down

&s;moothly, in the &s;ame manner he was drawn up. In this operation the whole weight of the criminal's body is &s;u&s;tained by his hands; and a &s;trong man can bear the puni&s;hment, inflicted in this manner, without fu|ture inconvenience; for the &s;trength of the mu&s;cles of his arms enables him to keep his hands pre&s;&s;ed on the middle of his back; and his body hangs in a kind of horizontal po&s;ition. But when they intend to be &s;evere, the criminal is allowed to fall from the greate&s;t height to which he had been rai&s;ed: and the fall is abruptly checked in the middle; by which means the hands and arms are immediately pulled above the head; both &s;houlders are di&s;located; and the body &s;wings, powerle&s;s, in a perpendicular line.</P>
<P>Breaking on the wheel is never u&s;ed in Rome, for any crime; but they &s;ometimes put in practice ano|ther mode of execution, which is much more &s;hock|ing, in appearance, than cruel, in reality; and what I have &s;lightly mentioned before. The criminal being &s;eated on a &s;caffold, the executioner, who &s;tands be|hind, &s;trikes him on the head, with a hammer of a particular con&s;truction, which deprives him at once of all &s;en&s;ation. When it is certain that he is completely dead, the executioner, with a large knife, cuts his throat from ear to ear. This la&s;t part of the cere|mony is thought to make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
minds of the &s;pectators, than the bloodle&s;s blow which deprives the criminal of life.</P>
<P>Executions are not frequent at Rome; there has been only one, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> during our re&s;idence in this city; and tho&s;e who are of the mo&s;t forgiving di&s;po&s;ition will acknowledge, that this criminal was not put to death till the mea&s;ure of his iniquity was &s;uffi|ciently full; he was condemned to be hanged for his fifth murder. An account of his execution, and the ceremonies which accompanied it, may &s;erve to throw &s;ome light on the &s;entiments and character of the people.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there was a proce&s;&s;ion of prie&s;ts; one of whom carried a crucifix, on a pole hung with black; they were followed by a number of people in long gowns, which covered them from head to foot, with holes immediately before the face, through which tho&s;e in di&s;gui&s;e could &s;ee every thing perfectly, while they could not be recognized by the &s;pectators. They are of the company <HI>della mi&s;ericordia;</HI> which is a &s;ociety of per&s;ons who, from motives of piety, think it a duty to vi&s;it criminals under &s;entence of death; endeavour to bring them to a proper &s;en&s;e of their guilt; a&s;&s;i&s;t them in making the be&s;t u&s;e of the &s;hort time they have to live, and who never for&s;ake them till the mo|ment of their execution. People of the fir&s;t rank are
<PB N="36" REF="38">
of this &s;ociety; and devoutly perform the mo&s;t la|borious functions of it. All of them carried lighted torches; and a few &s;hook tin boxes, into which the multitude put money, to defray the expence of ma&s;&s;es for the &s;oul of the criminal. This is con&s;idered, by many, as the mo&s;t meritorious kind of charity; and &s;ome, who&s;e circum&s;tances do not permit them to be|&s;tow much, confine all the expence they can afford in charity, to the &s;ingle article of purcha&s;ing ma&s;&s;es, to be &s;aid in behalf of tho&s;e who have died without leav|ing a farthing to &s;ave their &s;ouls. People are re|minded of this e&s;&s;ential kind of charity, not only by the preachers, but al&s;o by in&s;criptions upon the walls of particular churches and convents; and &s;ometimes the aid of the pencil is called in, to awaken the com|punction of the unfeeling, and hard-hearted. On the external walls, of &s;ome convents, immediately above the box into which you are directed to put your mo|ney, views of purgatory are painted in the mo&s;t flaming colours, where people are &s;een in all the agonies of burning, and rai&s;ing their indignant eyes to tho&s;e un|mindful relations and acquaintances, who, rather than part with a little money, allow them to remain in tho&s;e abodes of torment. As the Italians, in general, &s;eem to have more &s;en&s;ibility than any other people to be met with, and as there are &s;ome, who cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed totally in want of money, pa&s;s by tho&s;e pictures every day, without putting a farthing into the box, this
<PB N="37" REF="39">
&s;tingine&s;s mu&s;t be imputed to a lack of faith, rather than &s;en&s;ibility. Such unmindful pa&s;&s;engers are, probably, of the number of tho&s;e, who begin to &s;u&s;|pect that the money of the living can be of little u&s;e to the dead. Being ab&s;olutely certain that it gives them&s;elves much pain to part with it in this world, and doubtful whether it will have any efficacy in abridg|ing the pains of their friends in the other, they he&s;itate, for &s;ome time, between the two ri&s;ks; that of lo&s;ing their own money, and that of allowing their neigh|bour's &s;oul to continue in torture; and it would ap|pear that tho&s;e &s;ceptics generally decide the di&s;pute in favour of the money.</P>
<P>But in &s;uch a ca&s;e as that we have been de&s;cribing, where a poor wretch is going to be thru&s;t by violence out of this world, and &s;olicits a little money to pro|cure him a tolerable reception in the other, the pa&s;|&s;ions of the &s;pectators are too much agitated for cold rea&s;oning; and the mo&s;t niggardly &s;ceptic throws his mite into the boxes of the <HI>compagnia della mi&s;ericordia.</HI> Immediately after them came the malefactor him&s;elf, &s;eated in a cart, with a capuchin friar on each &s;ide of him. The hangman, with two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, dre&s;&s;ed in &s;carlet jackets, walked by the cart. This proce&s;&s;ion having moved &s;lowly round the gallows, which was erected in the piazza del popolo, the culprit de&s;cended from the cart, and was led to a hou&s;e in the neigbour|hood,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
attended by the two capuchins. He remained there above half an hour; was confe&s;&s;ed, and received ab&s;olution; after which he came out, exclaiming to the populace to join in prayer for his &s;oul, and walked with a hurried pace to the gallows; the hangman, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, having hold of his arms, they &s;upported him up a ladder; the unhappy man repeating prayers as fa&s;t as he could utter, till he was turned off. He was not left a moment to him&s;elf. The execu|tioner &s;tepped from the ladder, and &s;tood with a foot on each of his &s;houlders, &s;upporting him&s;elf in that &s;ituation, with his hands on the top of the gallows; the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, at the &s;ame time, pulling down the malefactor's legs, &s;o that he mu&s;t have died in an in|&s;tant. The executioner, in a &s;hort time, &s;lid to the ground, along the dead body, as a &s;ailor &s;lides down a rope. They then removed the cloth which covered his face, and twirled the body round with great rapi|dity, as if their intention had been to divert the mob; who did not, however, &s;hew any di&s;po&s;ition to be amu&s;ed in that manner. During the time appointed, by law, for the body to hang, all the members of the proce&s;&s;ion, with the whole apparatus of torches, cru|cifixes, and capuchins, went into a neighbouring church, and remained there, till a ma&s;s was &s;aid for the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed; and, when that was con|cluded, they returned in proce&s;&s;ion to the gallows; with a coffin covered with black cloth. On their
<PB N="39" REF="41">
approach, the executioner, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, ha&s;tily retired among the croud, and were no more allowed to come near the body. The condemned per&s;on hav|ing now paid the forfeit due to his crimes, was no longer con&s;idered as an object of hatred; his dead body was, therefore, re&s;cued from the contaminating touch of tho&s;e who are held by the populace in the greate&s;t abhorrence. Two per&s;ons in ma&s;ks, with long black gowns, mounted the ladder, and cut the rop; while others below, of the &s;ame fraternity, re|ceived the body, and put it carefully into the coffin. An old woman, with an exalted voice, then &s;aid, in Italian, "Now I hope that his &s;oul is in heaven;" and the multitude around &s;eemed all inclined to hope the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;erious and compa&s;&s;ionate manner, in which the Roman populace beheld this execution, forms a pre&s;umption of the gentlene&s;s of their di&s;po&s;itions. The crimes, of which this man had been guilty, mu&s;t naturally have rai&s;ed their indignation, and his pro|fe&s;&s;ion had a tendency to keep it up; for he was one of the &s;birri, all of whom are held in the mo&s;t perfect dete&s;tation, by the common people; yet the moment they &s;aw the object of their hatred, in the character of a poor condemned man, all their animo&s;ity cea&s;ed; no rancour was di&s;played, nor the lea&s;t in&s;ult offered, which could di&s;turb him in his la&s;t moments. They
<PB N="40" REF="42">
viewed him with the eyes of pity and forgivene&s;s, and joined with earne&s;tne&s;s in prayers for his future welfare.</P>
<P>The day of execution of any criminal at Rome, many of the nobility, in the dre&s;s of a friar, and ma&s;ked, &s;tand at the corners of the &s;treets, &s;ingly, with with a wooden plate, to receive the benevolence of pa&s;&s;engers, to pay for ma&s;&s;es for the &s;oul of the per|&s;on executed. The money &s;o collected will &s;ome|times amount to &pound;.40. This is depo&s;ited in the hands of the city-trea&s;urer, and is given away, by will, by the per&s;on who next forfeits his life to the &s;tate, to whom he plea&s;es; &s;o that the criminal, exe|cuted that day, has the di&s;po&s;al of the money col|lected on the day of execution preceding him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Manufactures, Revenue, Forces.</HEAD>
<P>ROME has &s;ome manufactures of &s;ilk, but the raw materials are not good; and, when worked up, they neither wear, nor look well; and yet are as dear as the be&s;t &s;ilks of foreign manufacture, This exor|bitant price is chiefly owing to the long credit which the Roman trade&s;men are obliged to give, the <HI>buona mancia,</HI> and the pre&s;ents required of them, by the &s;er|vants of the families who trade with them.</P>
<P>The only articles, which Rome exports, are arti|ficial flowers, pomatums, gloves &amp;c. but the&s;e con&s;ti|tute a commerce attended with con&s;iderable profit. Holland, Ireland, and Switzerland, &s;upply the city with linen; and England, with linen and cotton goods. There is very little ca&s;h in Rome; &s;o that payments are mo&s;tly made in paper; and here are &s;everal con&s;iderable banking hou&s;es, which keep the cour&s;e of exchange very high.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">The Pope's revenue mu&s;t be deemed very large; that, even of the countries of which he is &s;overeign, as a temporal prince, being very con&s;iderable. No per|&s;on in Rome, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> is to &s;ell any wine, or fruit, till the Pope and his nephews, with their de|pendents, have di&s;po&s;ed of what is con&s;igned to them from their deme&s;nes, and e&s;tates. The annual income of the Pope is computed at, nearly, one million &s;ter|ling. This revenue is under the management of the apo&s;tolic chamber; where the offices are &s;o lucra|tive, that &s;ome of the principal are &s;old for eighty, or one hundred thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>The revenues con&s;i&s;t in the produce of the unali|enated deme&s;nes of cu&s;toms, duties and taxes, on pro|vi&s;ions. Grain is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable article, and, apparently the mo&s;t beneficial to the &s;tate; but, in reality, the mo&s;t hurtful. Formerly Rome &s;upplied the city and territories of Genoa, and &s;ome parts of Tu&s;cany, with grain; but &s;ince the apo&s;tolic chamber, by virtue of an exclu&s;ive privilege, has a&s;&s;umed to it|&s;elf the purcha&s;e and &s;ale of grain; the demands of the Genoe&s;e have cea&s;ed; and both cultivation, and population, have been continually decrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The datary, where all collations for benefices are made out, is another great &s;ource of wealth; and, po&s;|&s;ibly, would be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, were not great
<PB N="43" REF="45">
part of its produce &s;wallowed up, under the appella|tion of <HI>drink-money,</HI> by a multitude of po&s;ts and em|ployments belonging to it.</P>
<P>To the revenues of the Pope mu&s;t likewi&s;e be added the produce of the &s;alt-pits at Cervia, which are very con&s;iderable; and that of the lottery, which is drawn eight times a year. This lottery is on the &s;ame plan as tho&s;e of Genoa, and the military &s;chool in France; and the people of Rome give into it, with all the pre|cipitation of hope, incited by pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, and the &s;pirit of calculation. In &s;hort, the lottery is, to this people, the locu&s;t which con&s;umes what the cat|terpillar has left.</P>
<P>By the&s;e revenues it was that <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. be&s;ides the ordinary expence of court and government, and even doubling tho&s;e expences, by undertakings worthy of ancient Rome, found means to accumulate, during the three fir&s;t years only of his pontificate, the three millions of gold, which he laid up in the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Angelo;</HI> which depo&s;it is &s;aid to have remained hi|therto untouched.</P>
<P>The military forces of the Pope make no great fi|gure, either by land or &s;ea. The places where any of the &s;oldiers are to be &s;een are, the ca&s;tle of St. <HI>An|gelo,</HI> Civita Vecchia, Urbino, Ferrara, and &s;ome &s;mall
<PB N="44" REF="46">
forts on the frontiers. His Swi&s;s guards are well cloathed and paid; yet their chief employment is to keep off the croud at public &s;olemnities. Foreigners, on all occa&s;ions, find them very civil; e&s;pecially if addre&s;&s;ed, in German, by the title of <HI>Land&s;man:</HI> but I remember, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> an Au&s;trian nobleman, of great rank, being pre&s;&s;ed by the croud, in return for his conde&s;cending compliment of <HI>Land&s;man,</HI> received this an&s;wer, <HI>Aye, to day, every bear-leader calls us coun|tryman.</HI></P>
<P>The Pope's gallies, which lie at Civita Vecchia, are of little con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Loretto,</HEAD>
<P>IS a &s;mall town, containing about &s;ix thou&s;and in|habitants, very plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a hill, three miles from the &s;ea, on the Adriatic gulph, and one hundred and forty-five ea&s;t of Rome. The walls of Loretto are about half an Italian mile in circum|ference, and yield a delightful pro&s;pect on one &s;ide of the &s;ea, and a beautiful vale, highly cultivated; and, on the other &s;ide of it, elegant &s;uburbs, which extend to Monte Real, along a &s;trait broad road. About &s;un-&s;et, in clear weather, the mountains of Croatia may be di&s;cerned, though they are a hundred and fifty miles di&s;tant from Loretto.</P>
<P>The town is but indifferently built; the principal &s;treet con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;mall &s;hops, in which are &s;old little el&s;e than beads for ro&s;aries, gold and &s;ilver or|naments for the &s;ame, worked in fillagree; &s;mall bra&s;s bells, much bought by the country people, as
<PB N="46" REF="48">
pre&s;ervatives again&s;t thunder and lightening; brown-paper caps to cure the head-ach; and broad ribbons, with the effigies of <HI>No&s;tra dama di Loretto,</HI> painted on them, to be worn by women in child-birth.</P>
<P>The holy chapel of Loretto, which has rendered this town &s;o famous through all the catholic part of Chi&s;tendom, was originally a &s;mall hou&s;e in Nazareth, inhabited by the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in which &s;he was &s;a|luted by the angel, and where &s;he bred our Saviour. According to the hi&s;tory of its adventures, it was in the month of May, 1291, tran&s;ported by angels, through the air, from Gallilee to Tor&s;ato, in Dal|matia; and, three years and a half after, into Italy; and on the 10th of December, in 1294, about mid|night, it was &s;et down in a wood, in the di&s;trict of Re|canati, about a thou&s;and paces from the &s;ea. If <HI>Tur&s;elini</HI> may be credited, on the alighting of this &s;a|cred hou&s;e, from its aerial journey, all the trees, and &s;hrubs in the wood, bowed with the greate&s;t reverence, and continued in that re&s;pectful po&s;ture, as long as the &s;acred chapel remained among them. Eight months after, it was again removed one thou&s;and paces nearer to Recanati; and at la&s;t, as it were with more mature deliberation, depo&s;ited in its pre&s;ent place. One can|not but be amazed at the credit given to &s;o ab&s;urd, and ridiculous a fable; and the more &s;o, as all catho|lic countries have been thereby voluntarily drawn into
<PB N="47" REF="49">
&s;uch onero&s;e contributions; it being notorious that, owing to the received chronology of this miraculous tran&s;migration, the &s;acred hou&s;e had been placed in Italy, and its fame much celebrated; even long before &s;ome papi&s;tical writers gave out they had &s;ought for it, and found it at Nazareth.</P>
<P>The &s;acred chapel &s;tands due ea&s;t and we&s;t, at the farther end of a large church of the mo&s;t durable &s;tone of I&s;tria; which has been built round it. This may be con&s;idered as the external covering, or a kind of great coat, to the <HI>ca&s;a &s;ancta;</HI> which has a &s;maller coat, of more precious materials and workman&s;hip, nearer its body. This internal covering, or ca&s;e, is of of the choice&s;t marble, and ornamented with bas re|liefs; the &s;ubjects of which are, the hi&s;tory of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, and other parts of the bible. The whole ca&s;e is about fifty feet long, thirty in breadth, and the &s;ame in height; but the real hou&s;e it&s;elf is no more than thirty-two feet in length, fourteen in breadth, and, at the &s;ides, about eighteen feet in height; the centre of the roof is four or five feet higher. The walls, of this little holy chapel, are compo&s;ed of pieces of a reddi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, of an ob|long &s;quare &s;hape, laid one upon another, in the man|ner of brick. At fir&s;t &s;ight, on a &s;uperficial view, the&s;e red-coloured oblong &s;ub&s;tances appear to be no|thing more than common Italian bricks; and, which
<PB N="48" REF="50">
is &s;till more extraordinary, on a &s;econd and third view, with all po&s;&s;ible attention, they &s;till have the &s;ame appearance. There is not, however, it is a&s;&s;ured, a &s;ingle particle of brick in their whole compo&s;ition; being entirely of a &s;tone, which, though it cannot now be found in Pale&s;tine, was formerly very common, particularly in the neighbourhood of Nazareth. There is a &s;mall interval between the walls of the an|cient hou&s;e, and the marble ca&s;e. The workmen, at fir&s;t intended them to be in contact, from an opinion, founded either upon gro&s;s ignorance, or infidelity, that the former &s;tood in need of &s;upport from the latter; the marble, &s;ay they, &s;tarted back of it&s;elf, from &s;uch impious familiarity; or el&s;e was thru&s;t back by the coyne&s;s of the virgin brick.</P>
<P>Above the door there is an in&s;cription; by which it appears, that any per&s;on, who enters with arms, is, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> excommunicated. There are al&s;o the &s;e|vere&s;t denunciations again&s;t tho&s;e, who carry away the &s;malle&s;t particle of the &s;tone and mortar belong|ing to this chapel. The per&s;on who attended us, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> took us a&s;ide, and told us, in a very &s;erious manner, that &s;trangers were apt &s;ecretly to break little pieces of &s;tone belonging to the <HI>&s;ancta ca&s;a,</HI> in hopes that &s;uch precious relics might bring them good for|tune; but he earne&s;tly entreated us not to do any &s;uch thing: for he knew a per&s;on at Venice, who had
<PB N="49" REF="51">
broken off a &s;mall corner of one of the &s;tones, and &s;lipt it into his breeches pocket unob&s;erved; but &s;o far from bringing him good fortune, it had burnt its way, like aqua-fortis, before he left the chapel; and &s;corched his thighs in &s;uch a terrible manner, that he was not able to &s;it on hor&s;eback for a month. Had it not been for the impre&s;&s;ions &s;uch &s;tories as the&s;e make, &s;o great was the eagerne&s;s of the multitude to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any portion of this little edifice, that the whole was in danger of being carried away; not by angels, but by piece-meal, in the pockets of the pilgrims.</P>
<P>The holy hou&s;e is divided, within, into two equal portions, by a kind of grate-work of &s;ilver. In the larger divi&s;ion, which may be con&s;idered as the main body of the hou&s;e, the walls are left bare, to &s;hew the true original fabric of Nazareth &s;tone. The&s;e &s;tones, which bear &s;uch a &s;trong re&s;emblance to bricks, are loo&s;e in many places. I took notice of this, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to a pilgrim; he &s;miled, &s;aying, "Be not afraid, my good &s;ir, the&s;e walls are more firm than the Apen|nines." At the lower, or entrance wall, there is a window; the &s;ame, they &s;ay, through which the angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> entered, at the annunciation. The architraves of this window are covered with &s;ilver. There are a great number of gold and &s;ilver lamps in this chapel; one of them is a pre&s;ent from the republic of Venice;
<PB N="50" REF="52">
it is of gold, and weighs thirty-&s;even pounds: &s;ome of the &s;ilver lamps weigh, from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and thirty pounds. At the upper end of the large&s;t room is an altar; but &s;o low, that from it may be &s;een the famous image which &s;tands over the chimney, in the &s;maller of the two divi&s;ions, which is called the &s;anctuary. Gold and &s;ilver an|gels, of con&s;iderable &s;ize, kneel around her; &s;ome offering hearts of gold, enriched with diamonds; and one, an infant of pure gold. The figure, of the vir|gin her&s;elf, by no means corre&s;ponds with the fine furniture of her hou&s;e; &s;he is a little woman, about four feet in height, with the features and complexion of a negro. Of all the &s;culptors that ever exhibited, a&s;&s;uredly St. <HI>Luke,</HI> by whom the friar is &s;aid to have been made, is the lea&s;t of a flatterer; and nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin's con|tempt for external beauty, than her being &s;atisfied with this repre&s;entation of her; e&s;pecially if her face, and per&s;on, really re&s;embled tho&s;e beautiful ideas of her, conveyed by the pencils of <HI>Raphael, Corregio,</HI> and <HI>Guido.</HI> The figure of the infant <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> is of a piece with that of the virgin; he holds a large globe in one hand, and the other is extended in the act of ble&s;&s;ing. Both figures have crowns on their heads, enriched with diamonds; the&s;e were pre&s;ents from <HI>Anne</HI> of Au&s;tria, Queen of France. Both arms of the virgin are enclo&s;ed within her robes, and no
<PB N="51" REF="53">
part but her face is to be &s;een; her dre&s;s is mo&s;t mag|nificent; but in a wretched bad ta&s;te. She has par|ticular clothes for the different fe&s;tivals held in ho|nour of her: and, what does not appear &s;o very de|cent, is dre&s;&s;ed, and undre&s;&s;ed, by the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall place behind the &s;anctuary, into which &s;trangers, of decent appearance, are &s;eldom re|fu&s;ed admittance. In this they &s;hew the chimney, and &s;ome other furniture, which they pretend be|longed to the virgin, when &s;he lived at Nazareth; particularly a little earthen porringer, out of which the infant u&s;ed to eat. The pilgrims bring ro&s;aries, little crucifixes, and <HI>agnus dei</HI>'s, which the obliging prie&s;t &s;hakes for half a minute in this di&s;h: after which, it is believed, they acquire the virtue of curing various di&s;ea&s;es, and prove an excellent preventative again&s;t all the temptations of <HI>Satan.</HI> The gown, which the image had on, when the chapel arrived from Nazareth, is of red camblet, and carefully kept in a gla&s;s &s;hrine.</P>
<P>Above a hundred ma&s;&s;es are daily &s;aid in this cha|pel; and in the church, in which it &s;tands. The mu&s;ic is remarkably fine. A certain number of the chaplains are eunuchs.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">The jewels and riches to be &s;een, at any one time, in the holy chapel, are of &s;mall value, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e in the trea&s;ury; which is a large room ad|joining the ve&s;try of the great church. In the pre&s;&s;es of this room are kept tho&s;e pre&s;ents, which royal, noble, and rich bigots, of all ranks, have, by oppre&s;&s;|ing their &s;ubjects, and injuring their families, &s;ent to this place. To enumerate every particular would fill volumes. They con&s;i&s;t of various uten&s;ils, and other things in &s;ilver and gold; as lamps, candle&s;ticks, goblets, crowns, and crucifixes; lambs, eagles, &s;aints, apo&s;tles, angels, virgins, and infants: then there are cameos, pearls, gems, and precious &s;tones of all kinds, and in great numbers. What is valued, above all the other jewels, is the miraculous pearl; wherein they a&s;&s;ert, that nature has given a faithful delineation of the virgin, &s;itting on a cloud, with the infant <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in her arms.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the&s;e pieces are occa&s;ionally melted down, by his Holine&s;s, for the u&s;e of the &s;tate: and al&s;o that the mo&s;t precious of the jewels are picked out, and &s;old for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; fal&s;e &s;tones being &s;ub&s;tituted in their room. This is an affair, however, entirely between the Virgin and the Pope; if &s;he does not complain, there is no other per&s;on, who has a right to do it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">Pilgrimages to Loretto are not &s;o frequent, with foreigners, or with per&s;ons of fortune and di&s;tinction, as formerly; nineteen, out of twenty, of tho&s;e who make this journey now, are poor people, who depend for their maintenance on the charity they receive on the road. To tho&s;e who are of &s;uch a rank in life, as precludes them from availing them&s;elves of the cha|ritable in&s;titutions for the maintenance of pilgrims, &s;uch journies are attended with expence, and incon|venience; and fathers and hu&s;bands, in moderate cir|cum&s;tances, are frequently brought into di&s;agreeable dilemmas, by the ra&s;h vow of going to Loretto; which their wives and daughters are apt to make, on any &s;uppo&s;ed deliverance from danger. To refu&s;e, is con&s;idered by the whole neighbourhood as cruel, and even impious; and to grant, is often highly di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing; and particularly to &s;uch hu&s;bands as, from af|fection, or any other motive, do not chu&s;e that their wives &s;hould be long out of their fight. But to the poor, who are maintained during their whole journey, and have nothing more than a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to ex|pect from their labour at home, Loretto is a party of plea&s;ure, as well as devotion; and by much the mo&s;t agreeable road they can take to heaven. It being a year of Jubilee, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> when we vi&s;ited this place, there was a far greater concour&s;e of pilgrims, of all ranks, than is u&s;ual. We &s;aw a few in their carriages, a greater number on hor&s;eback, or on
<PB N="54" REF="56">
mules; or what is &s;till more common, on a&s;&s;es. Great numbers of females come in this manner, with a male friend walking by them, as their guide and protector: but the greate&s;t number, of both &s;exes, are on foot. As we approached near Loretto, the road was crouded with them: they generally &s;et out before &s;un ri&s;e; and having repo&s;ed them&s;elves, during the heat of the day, continue their journey again in the even|ing. They &s;ing their matins, and their evening hymns, aloud. As many have fine voices, and delicate ears, their vocal concerts have a charming effect, at a little di&s;tance. During the &s;tillne&s;s of the morning, and the evening, we were &s;erenaded with this &s;olemn, religious mu&s;ic, for a con&s;iderable part of the road. The pil|grims on foot, as &s;oon as they enter the &s;uburbs, be|gin a hymn, in honour of the virgin; which they continue till they reach the church. The poorer &s;ort are received into an ho&s;pital, where they have bed and board for three days.</P>
<P>In the great church, which contains the holy cha|pel, are confe&s;&s;ionals, where the penitents, from every country of Europe, may be confe&s;&s;ed in their own language; prie&s;ts being always in waiting for that purpo&s;e; each of them has a long white rod in his hand, with which he touches tho&s;e, to whom he thinks proper to give ab&s;olution. They place them&s;elves on their knees in groupes, around the confe&s;&s;ional
<PB N="55" REF="57">
chair; and when the holy father has touched their heads with the expiatory rod, they retire, freed from the burthen of their &s;ins; and with renewed courage to begin a fre&s;h account.</P>
<P>In the &s;pacious area, before the church, there is an elegant marble fountain, &s;upplied with water from an adjoining hill, by an aqueduct. Few, even of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable towns of Italy, are without the u&s;eful ornament of a public fountain. The embel|li&s;hments of architecture and &s;culpture are employed, with great propriety, on &s;uch works as are continually in the people's view; the air is refre&s;hed, and the eye delighted, by the &s;treams of water they pour forth; a fight peculiarly agreeable in a warm climate. In this area there is al&s;o a &s;tatue of <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. in bronze. Over the portal of the church is a &s;tatue of the vir|gin; and above the middle gate is a Latin in&s;cription, importing, that within is the hou&s;e of the mother of God, in which the Word was made fle&s;h. The gates of the church are likewi&s;e of bronze, embelli&s;hed with bas reliefs, of admirable workman&s;hip; the &s;ub|jects taken partly from the Old, and partly from the New Te&s;tament, and divided into different com|partments.</P>
<P>As the gates of this church are &s;hut at noon, the pilgrims, who arrive after that hour, can get no nearer
<PB N="56" REF="58">
to the <HI>&s;ancta ca&s;a</HI> than the&s;e gates; which are, by this means, expo&s;ed to the fir&s;t violence of the holy ar|dour which was de&s;igned for the chapel it&s;elf. And all the &s;culpture on the gates, within reach of the mouths of the&s;e holy zealots, is, in &s;ome degree, ef|faced by their ki&s;&s;es. The murder of <HI>Abel</HI> happens to be in that part of the &s;culpture which is on a level with the lips of a per&s;on of ordinary &s;ize, when kneel|ing. Poor <HI>Abel!</HI> had he been placed a foot higher, or a foot lower, he might have remained in &s;ecurity for ages; but in the unlucky part that the &s;culptor has put him, his whole body has been, almo&s;t, entirely ki&s;&s;ed away by the pilgrims; whil&s;t his brother <HI>Cain</HI> &s;tands untouched, in his original attitude, frowning, and as fierce as ever.</P>
<P>Of the paintings to be &s;een here, there are two in the trea&s;ury very highly e&s;teemed. The &s;ubject of one of the&s;e is the Virgin's Nativity, by <HI>Annibal Ca|racci;</HI> and of the other, the Holy Family, by <HI>Raphael.</HI> There are likewi&s;e &s;ome others, which ornament the altars of the great church. The&s;e altars, or little chapels, of which this fabric contains a great number, are lined with marble, and embelli&s;hed by &s;culpture; but nothing within this church is &s;o intere&s;ting as the iron grates, before the chapels, which are made of the fetters, and chains, of the chri&s;tian &s;laves, freed from bondage by the glorious victory of Lepanto.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">The ideas that ru&s;h into one's mind, on hearing a a circum&s;tance of this kind, are affecting beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, To think of four thou&s;and of our fellow-creatures, torn from the &s;ervice of their country, and the arms of friend&s;hip, chained to oars, &s;ubjected con|tinually to the revilings of enemies, and every kind of ignominious treatment; and when their &s;ouls were &s;inking under the weight of &s;uch accumulated cala|mity, and brought to the very verge of de&s;pair&mdash;at once, in one ble&s;&s;ed moment, to be freed from &s;lavery, re&s;tored to the embraces of their friends, and enjoy with them all the raptures of victory&mdash;God! what a &s;cene! What a number of &s;cenes! For the imagina|tion, after glancing upon the whole, di&s;tingui&s;hes and &s;e|parates objects, and forms a thou&s;and groupes, of the mo&s;t pathetic kind; the fond recognition of old com|panions, brothers flying into each others arms, and the extacy of fathers, on the recovery of their lo&s;t &s;ons.</P>
<P>Such are the pictures that fancy repre&s;ents, when contemplating tho&s;e grates, &s;o truly ornamental of a chri&s;tian church; and &s;o perfectly congenial with a religion, requiring men to <HI>relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;et the captive free.</HI></P>
<P>About ten pilgrims arrive every year, on an aver|age, from England, at Loretto; where the people be|lieve, tho&s;e of the Roman Catholic religion keep up
<PB N="58" REF="60">
more &s;trictly to the principles of their faith, than tho&s;e of France, or Italy.</P>
<P>The people of Loretto, whatever rea&s;on they may have to depend on the invi&s;ible protection of the vir|gin, e&s;pecially as to what concerns the trea&s;ury con|&s;ecrated to her, do not think it advi&s;able to put her to the trial; for the window of the trea&s;ury is not only &s;trongly barred up, but the city is al&s;o fortified.</P>
<P>The&s;e fortifications are indeed a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t any &s;udden attack of pirates, but el&s;e of little importance; for, in many places, the hou&s;es &s;upply the place of walls.</P>
<P>Loretto is generally without a garri&s;on; &s;o that it &s;eems &s;trange the Turks have not made greater ef|forts, for getting into their hands the precious booty it contains, than they have hitherto done. The Ro|man Catholics indeed affirm, that in all the attempts which the Turks have made again&s;t Loretto, they have either been repelled by &s;ome extraordinary miracle, or mi&s;carried by a &s;uper-natural panic. But all the&s;e miracles have not prevented the inhabitants, upon the lea&s;t appearance of danger, from &s;ending away the trea&s;ure to Ancona, or &s;ome other place of &s;ecurity. Another rea&s;on why the Turks do not make any for|mal attempt upon this place, may, probably, be ow|ing
<PB N="59" REF="61">
to the &s;hallowne&s;s of the Adriatic, which has not a depth of water &s;ufficient for large &s;hips to approach the &s;hore. Be&s;ides, Loretto being three Italian miles from the &s;ea, and in an open country, no de&s;cent can be made with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, as not to alarm the whole neighbourhood, who are ready to &s;acrifice their lives in defence of the virgin, and would &s;oon be under arms. The burghers amount to above three hundred, and the inhabitants, in the town and &s;uburbs, are reckoned to exceed &s;even thou&s;and; and be&s;ides, a Turki&s;h &s;quadron is no &s;ooner known to be at &s;ea, than a &s;trong garri&s;on is immediately &s;ent here.</P>
<P>The only trade of Loretto con&s;i&s;ts of ro&s;aries, cru|cifixes, little Madonas, and medals, which are manu|factured here, and &s;old to pilgrims. There are great numbers of &s;hops full of the&s;e commodities, &s;ome of them at a high price; but infinitely the greater part adapted to the pur&s;es of the buyers, and &s;old for a mere trifle. The evident poverty of the&s;e manufac|turers, and traders, and of the inhabitants of this town in general, is a &s;ufficient proof that the reputation of our lady of Loretto is greatly on the decline.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Ancona.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tance from Loretto to Ancona is fifteen Italian miles; and the road lies through a charm|ing plain, inter&s;ected by the rivers Mu&s;one and Arpido. Here we cannot but ob&s;erve that in no other chain of mountains are &s;o many &s;ources of brooks, and rivers, to be found, as on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Apennines.</P>
<P>Ancona, at a di&s;tance, is one of the mo&s;t &s;triking pro&s;pects in Italy; it &s;tands both on the &s;ummit, and the brow of a hill. It has a mole, a fine citadel, and, in &s;hort, is a flouri&s;hing town. It is hardly to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> how beautiful the environs of An|cona are; the road is hilly, but the gradual wavings of the vineyards, and arable grounds, afford the mo&s;t plea&s;ing images of peace and plenty. The Adriatic, near the road, on one hand; and the Apennines, at the di&s;tance, perhaps, of thirty miles, on the other, &s;eem to beautify the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">This town is &s;aid to have been founded by the Sy|racu&s;ians, who fled from the tyranny of <HI>Diony&s;ius.</HI> The town originally was built on a hill; but the hou&s;es have been gradually extended, down the face of the eminence, towards the &s;ea. The cathedral &s;tands on the highe&s;t part; from whence there is a mo&s;t advantageous view of the town, the country, and the &s;ea. This church is &s;uppo&s;ed to be placed on the &s;pot where a temple, dedicated to <HI>Venus,</HI> formerly &s;tood; the &s;ame mentioned by <HI>Juvenal,</HI> when he &s;peaks of a large turbot caught on this coa&s;t, and pre|&s;ented to the Emperor <HI>Domitian.</HI></P>
<P>The a&s;cents and de&s;cents, and great inequality of ground, will prevent this from being a beautiful town; but it has much the appearance of becoming a rich one. Some of the nobility have the firmne&s;s, and good &s;en&s;e, to de&s;pi&s;e an ancient prejudice, and avowedly pro&s;ecute commmerce. New hou&s;es are daily building, and the &s;treets are animated with the daily bu&s;tle of trade. I met, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> with &s;everal Engli&s;h traders on the change; which &s;eemed crouded with &s;ea-faring men, and merchants, from Dalmatia, Greece, and many parts of Europe. There are great numbers of Jews e&s;tabli&s;hed in this city; and it is generally remarked, that tho&s;e places are in a thriving condition, to which they re&s;ort. They have a &s;yna|gogue here; and, although all religions are tolerated,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
theirs is the only foreign wor&s;hip, allowed to be pub|licly exerci&s;ed. The commerce of Ancona has in|crea&s;ed very rapidly of late years; and it is evident that the popes, who fir&s;t thought of making it a free-port, of encouraging manufactures, and building a mole to render the harbour more &s;afe, have injured Venice in a more &s;en&s;ible manner, than tho&s;e who thundered bulls again&s;t that republic; but it is much to be que&s;tioned whether the former, by their encou|ragements to commerce, have augmented their own &s;piritual importance, in the &s;ame proportion they have the temporal riches of their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Men who have received a liberal education, and have adopted liberal &s;entiments, previous to their en|gaging in any particular profe&s;&s;ion, will carry tho&s;e &s;entiments along with them through life; and perhaps there is no profe&s;&s;ion in which they can be exerci&s;ed with more advantage, and utility, than in that of a merchant. In this profe&s;&s;ion, a man of the character above de&s;cribed, while he is augmenting his own pri|vate fortune, will enjoy the agreeable reflection that he is likewi&s;e increa&s;ing the riches, and power of his country; and giving bread to thou&s;ands of his indu&s;|trious countrymen. Of all profe&s;&s;ions, his is, in its nature, the mo&s;t independent: the merchant does not, like the &s;oldier, receive wages from his &s;overeign; nor, like the lawyer and phy&s;ician, from his fellow-&s;ubjects.
<PB N="63" REF="65">
His wealth often flows from foreign &s;ources, and he is is under no obligation to tho&s;e from whom it is derived. The habit which he is in, of circulating millions, makes him lay le&s;s &s;tre&s;s on a few guineas, than the proprietors of the large&s;t e&s;tates; and we daily &s;ee, in countries where this pro&s;e&s;&s;ion is not con|&s;idered as degrading, the commercial parts of the in|habitants giving the mo&s;t exalted proofs of genero&s;ity, and public &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But in countries where no one, who has the &s;malle&s;t claim to the title of gentleman, can engage in com|merce, without being thought to have demeaned him|&s;elf, fewer examples of this nature will be found: and, in every country it mu&s;t be acknowledged that tho&s;e who have not had the advantage of a liberal educa|tion, who have been taught to con&s;ider money as the mo&s;t valuable of all things; and who are continually revolving in their minds, the various means of increa&s;|ing their &s;tock; it &s;wells in their imagination beyond its real worth; and, at length, by an inver&s;ion of the chri&s;tian precept, is con&s;idered as the one thing need|ful; to be &s;ought with the mo&s;t unremitting ardour, that all things may be added thereto.</P>
<P>In commercial towns, where all find employment, and are agitated by the bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s, the minds of the inhabitants are apt to be &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed with the affairs of this world, as almo&s;t to forget that
<PB N="64" REF="66">
there is another; and neither the true religion, nor fal&s;e ones, have &s;uch fa&s;t hold of their minds, as in places where there is more poverty and le&s;s worldly occupation. In the fir&s;t, they con&s;ider the remon|&s;trances of prie&s;ts and confe&s;&s;ors, as interruptions to bu&s;ine&s;s; and without daring to de&s;pi&s;e the ceremonies of religion, the hurried trader huddles them over as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, that he may return to occupations more congenial with the habit of his mind. The preach|ers may cry aloud, and proclaim the vanity of this world, and all it contains; but men, who have been trained to the pur&s;uit of money from their childhood, who have be&s;towed infinite pains to acquire it, and who derive all their importance from it, mu&s;t natu|rally have a partiality for this world, where riches procure &s;o many flattering di&s;tinctions; and a preju|dice again&s;t that, in which they procure none; but, in towns where there is little trade, and great num|bers of poor people, where they have much &s;pare time, and &s;mall comfort in this world, the clergy have an ea&s;ier ta&s;k, if they are tolerably a&s;&s;iduous, in turn|ing the attention of the inhabitants to the other. In Roman Catholic towns, of this de&s;cription, we &s;ee the people continually pacing up and down the &s;treets, with wax tapers in their hands. They li&s;ten, with fond attention, to all the prie&s;t relates concerning that invi&s;ible country, that land of promi&s;e, where their hopes are centered; they ruminate, with complacency,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
on the happy period, when they al&s;o &s;hall have their good things; they bear their pre&s;ent rage with pati|ence, in expectation of the white raiment,, and crowns of gold, which they are told await them; they lan|gui&s;h for the happine&s;s of being promoted to that lofty &s;ituation, from whence they may look down, with &s;corn, on tho&s;e to whom they now look up with envy; and where they &s;hall retaliate on their wealthy neigh|bours, who&s;e riches, at pre&s;ent, they imagine, in&s;ult their poverty.</P>
<P>This town being expo&s;ed, by the nature of its com|merce with Turkey, to the contagious di&s;ea&s;es which prevail in that country, <HI>Clement</HI> XII. as &s;oon as he determined to make it a free-port, erected a lazaretto. It advances a little way into the &s;ea; and is a very noble, as well as u&s;eful, edifice. He afterwards be|gan a work as nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;till more expen&s;ive; and that is the mole, built in the &s;ea, to &s;creen the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour from the winds; which fre|quently blow, from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Adriatic, with great violence. This was carried on with re|doubled &s;pirit by <HI>Benedict</HI> XIV. after his quarrel with Venice; has been continued by the &s;ucceeding popes, and is now almo&s;t fini&s;hed. This building was founded in the ruins of the ancient mole, rai&s;ed by the Emperor <HI>Trajan.</HI> The &s;tone of I&s;tria was u&s;ed at fir&s;t, till the exportation of it was prohibited, by the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
republic of Venice; who had no rea&s;on to wi&s;h well to this work. But a quarry of excellent &s;tone was after|wards found, near Ancona, as fit for the purpo&s;e; and a kind of &s;and, which, when mixed with lime, forms a compo&s;ition as hard as any &s;tone, is brought from the neighbourhood of Rome; and no other is u&s;ed for this building; which is above two thou&s;and feet in length, one hundred in breadth, and about &s;ixty in depth, from the &s;urface of the &s;ea. A &s;tupendous work, more analogous to the power and revenues of ancient, than modern Rome.</P>
<P>Near to this &s;tands the triumphal arch, as it is called, of <HI>Trajan.</HI> This is an honorary monument, erected in gratitude to the emperor, for the improve|ments he made in the harbour, at his own expence. Next to the <HI>Mai&s;on quarr&eacute;e,</HI> at Nimus, it is the mo&s;t beautiful, and mo&s;t entire monument extant, of Ro|man ta&s;te and magnificence. The fluted Corinthian pillars, on the two &s;ides, are of the fine&s;t propor|tions; and the Parian marble, of which they are compo&s;ed, in&s;tead of having acquired a black colour, like the ducal palace of Venice, and other buildings of marble, is pre&s;erved, by the &s;ea-vapour, as white and &s;hining, as if it were fre&s;h poli&s;hed from the rock.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Ancona, e&s;pecially the female &s;ex, &s;o far excel tho&s;e of the other parts of Italy, in
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;hape and complexion, that they &s;eem to be quite a different race of men. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the inhabitants beyond Senegallia, Fano, and Pe&s;aro, as far as Rincini. If it be true that the re&s;ort of young gentlemen to the univer&s;ities, and the numerous retinue of a court, greatly contribute to render Leip|&s;ick, Hall, and Dre&s;den, as it were the nur&s;eries of fine women; the &s;uperior beauty of the female &s;ex at Fano, Ancona, &amp;c. may likewi&s;e be attributed to the great number of &s;trangers, and pilgrims, continually travelling through tho&s;e cities.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the people of Ancona, according to <HI>Mi&s;&s;on,</HI> is very &s;ingular. He ob&s;erved, on their fe&s;|tivals, that the principal inhabitants wore black clothes, lined with green; blue &s;tockings; &s;hoes whitened with chalk, and tied with coloured ribbons; their wai&s;tcoats unbuttoned, and the cuffs of their &s;leeves embroidered; their &s;hirts fall, and hang over their finger's ends. The wives, and daughters, of the ordinary cla&s;s of citizens, wore head-dre&s;&s;es, with long fringes, hanging over their faces; the body of their gowns were of red and yellow &s;ilk, laced all over with broad &s;eams of gold, or &s;ilver lace, like a livery; their petticoats very &s;hort, and of a hundred different colours. The ladies of quality were dre&s;&s;ed after the French fa&s;hions, but looked &s;o very auk|ward,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
that they even made a more fanta&s;tical, and ri|diculous appearance, than the citizens.</P>
<P>About fifteen miles from Ancona lies Senegallia; another &s;ea-port, upon this coa&s;t. There is nothing remarkable in this town, except during the time of the great fair, which is held once a year; to which a great concour&s;e of merchants re&s;ort from Venice, and all towns, on both &s;ides of the Adriatic; al&s;o from Si|cily, and the Archipelago. England carries on a very profitable trade with this, and all the other towns of Romagnia; from which our merchants purcha&s;e great quantities of raw &s;ilk, and afterwards &s;ell it, when manufactured, to the inhabitants. They pro|vide them al&s;o with Engli&s;h cotton, and linen cloths, of every kind.</P>
<P>A few miles on this &s;ide Fano, in the road to Bo|logna, near the river Metro, is the &s;pot where <HI>Claudius Nero,</HI> the Roman con&s;ul, defeated <HI>A&s;drubal,</HI> the bro|ther of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> This was, perhaps, the mo&s;t im|portant victory the Romans ever gained; for, had <HI>A&s;drubal</HI> been victorious, or been able to effect a junction with his brother, the troops he brought from Spain would have become of triple value, as &s;oon as they were under the direction of <HI>Hannibal;</HI> and it is not improbable that, with &s;uch a reinforcement, that mo&s;t con&s;ummate general would have put an end to
<PB N="69" REF="71">
the Roman &s;tate; and the glory of Carthage would have begun, where that of Rome ended.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Senegallia to Fano is &s;ixteen miles. This town derives its name from a temple of fortune, which &s;tood here in the time of the Romans. All the towns of Italy, however religious they may be, are proud of their connexions with the&s;e cele|brated heathens. An image of the godde&s;s <HI>Fortune</HI> is erected on the fountain in the market-place; and the inhabitants &s;hew &s;ome ruins, which they pretend belong to the ancient temple of Fortune; but what cannot be di&s;puted are, the ruins of a triumphal arch, in white marble, erected in honour of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and which was greatly damaged by the artillery of Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the &s;econd, when he be&s;ieged this town, in the year 1463. The churches of this town are adorned with &s;ome excellent pictures; there is one, particularly, in the cathedral church, by <HI>Guercino,</HI> which is much admired. The &s;ubject is the marriage of <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> it con&s;i&s;ts of three principal figures; the High Prie&s;t, <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and the Virgin.</P>
<P>The other towns which we &s;hall ju&s;t &s;lightly touch upon, before we treat of Bologna and its territories, are, Pe&s;aro, Rimini, and Ravenna; which all lie on the coa&s;t of the Adriatic. Pe&s;aro lies about eighteen Italian miles from Fano. It is a very agreeable
<PB N="70" REF="72">
town; better built, and paved, than many on this coa&s;t. In the market-place there is a hand&s;ome foun|tain; and a &s;tatue of Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the eighth, in a &s;it|ting po&s;ture. In the churches of this town are &s;ome pictures by <HI>Baroccio,</HI> a painter, who&s;e works &s;ome e&s;teem very highly; and who is thought to have imi|tated the manner of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and the tints of <HI>Corregio,</HI> not without &s;ucce&s;s. He lived about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century; and his colours &s;eem to have improved by time; but the operation of &s;un and air, on pictures, bringing all the colours to a kind of uni|&s;on, occa&s;ions what is called harmony; and is thought an improvement on &s;ome pictures. This road, along the Adriatic coa&s;t, is extremely plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The Pe&s;aro figs are accounted the be&s;t in all Italy; and even preferred to tho&s;e of Sclavonia.</P>
<P>Rimini, the next &s;tage on the road to Bologna, was famous in antiquity; and &s;till contains &s;ome monu|ments, worthy the attention of the curious traveller. It is the ancient Ariminum; the fir&s;t town of which <HI>Coe&s;ar</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, after pa&s;&s;ing the Rubicon. In the market-place there is a kind of &s;tone pede&s;tal, with an in&s;cription; declaring, that on it <HI>Coe&s;ar</HI> had &s;tood, and harrangued his army. Rimini had formerly a good harbour; but it is now &s;o choaked with &s;and, as &s;carce to afford depth of water for pa&s;&s;age-boats.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">Between this town and Ravenna is the river of Pi&s;|catello, the famous Rubicon, which was the ancient boundary between Italy and Ci&s;alpine Gaul. No Roman, returning to Rome, could pa&s;s in arms be|yond this; without being deemed an enemy to his country. The &s;mall town of Ce&s;enate is &s;ituated near the brook; and the inhabitants value them&s;elves, not a little, upon their vicinity to &s;o celebrated a neigh|bour.</P>
<P>Ravenna, ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome learned men, to be founded by <HI>E&s;au,</HI> was, not only during the gran|deur of ancient Rome, but a con&s;iderable time after, famous for the Exarchs; of which it was the &s;eat. At one period it was the &s;eat of empire; for, after <HI>Attila</HI> had left Italy, <HI>Valentinian</HI> cho&s;e Ravenna, in prefer|ence to Rome, for his re&s;idence; that he might al|ways be ready to repel the Huns, and other barbari|ans, who poured from the banks of the Danube, and prevent their penetrating into Italy. The &s;ame rea|&s;on afterwards induced <HI>Theodoric,</HI> king of the O&s;tro|goths, to keep his court at this city of Ravenna; after he had defeated, and killed, <HI>Odoacer,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed the title of king of Rome. The ruins of his palace, and his tomb, now form part of the antiquities of this town; which is &s;ituated three miles from the Adriatic &s;ea; a hundred miles north-we&s;t from Ancona; and eighty &s;outh of Venice; being &s;urrounded by two &s;mall ri|vers.
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Its ancient &s;ituation is &s;aid to have been like that of Venice, upon certain i&s;lands, when it was one of the be&s;t harbours the Romans had on that coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The buildings are, in general, very indifferent; the magnificent churches, and palaces, it formerly con|tained, are verging fa&s;t to ruin; the trade is gone, and the town very thinly inhabited,</P>
<P>How &s;carce good &s;pring-water, fit for drinking was, anciently, at Ravenna, appears from <HI>Martial,</HI> who &s;ays, in his fifth book:
<Q><L><HI>Sit ci&s;terna mihi qu&agrave;m vinea malo Ravennoe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cum po&s;&s;im multo vendere pluris aquam.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>"Lodg'd at Ravenna, water &s;ells &s;o dear,</L>
<L>A ci&s;tern, to a vineyard, I prefer."</L></Q></P>
<P>And again,
<Q><L><HI>Callidus impo&s;uit nuper mihi caupo Ravennoe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cum peterem mixtum, vendidit ille merum.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>"By a Ravenna vintner once betray'd,</L>
<L>So much for wine and water mix'd I paid;</L>
<L>But when I thought the purchas'd liquor mine,</L>
<L>The ra&s;cal only fobb'd me off with wine."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">In pa&s;&s;ing through Ravenna, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> we experienced the truth of what is &s;aid concerning the badne&s;s, as well as &s;carcity, of water: it is boiled, in order to be rendered whole&s;ome; and is &s;o thick, from the number of <HI>animalculoe</HI> contained in it, as to require to be &s;trained; and, after all, it &s;tinks abo|minably. The wine is excellent; richer than Cy|prus. When we changed hor&s;es we ob&s;erved that the po&s;t-boys had brought water with them, to ex|change for an equal quantity of wine, which was done in our pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ravenna is now only a va&s;t &s;olitude, con&s;idering its &s;ize; though the &s;treets are large, &s;trait, and regu|lar, with &s;quares and fountains: and mo&s;t of its &s;acred edifices are &s;tately remains of its ancient &s;plendor. There are two ho&s;pitals in this town; the cleanline&s;s of which would be admired, even in Holland; &s;o that citizens, of all ranks, make them their refuge in time of &s;ickne&s;s; as being every way better attended, and provided for, than they can expect to be at their own hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e remains of its ancient &s;plendor, Ravenna is now only <HI>magni nominis umbra,</HI> the &s;hadow of a great name. It has neither commerce or manu|factures; the bulk of its inhabitants are idle nobles, who make the intere&s;t of the different princes of Eu|rope
<PB N="74" REF="76">
the only object of their &s;tudies. The great &s;quare, where they meet every evening, is geometri|cally divided between the two contending parties; one of which is careful never to &s;et its foot on the others ground; on only cro&s;&s;ing this &s;quare it may be &s;een, in time of any continental war, which &s;ide has the better; this is manife&s;t in the exultation of the victors, and the dejection of the lo&s;ing party. News is ex|pected there, with more impatience, than in the cabi|net of any one &s;overeign of Europe.</P>
<P>In a convent, belonging to the Benedictines, is a com|plete collection of medicaments for treating di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds; and every imaginable expedient for the con|venience of the &s;ick. Be&s;ides a well-furni&s;hed labo|ratory, and an excellent phy&s;ic garden; here are &s;ix large rooms on a floor. In the fir&s;t is a complete &s;et of pieces of anatomy; then all the in&s;truments con|trived for chirurgical operations; together with thread, needles, tents, bandages, &s;uitable to every operation; la&s;tly, a &s;torehou&s;e of beds, &s;heets, bed cloaths, couches, pillows, cut out, and prepared for the ready u&s;e of every kind of di&s;ea&s;e, with all po&s;&s;ible convenience to tho&s;e who attend the patients. The&s;e &s;tores are di&s;tributed in large pre&s;&s;es, which line the &s;ix rooms, and are of very neat workman&s;hip. For tho&s;e di&s;orders, which require riding, there is a mo&s;t ingenious inven|tion. It is a large dragon, &s;u&s;pended in the middle

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Bologna.</HEAD>
<P>BOLOGNA, on account of its extent, the number of its nobility, and other inhabitants, and the im|portance of its trade, is, next to Rome, the fine&s;t, and mo&s;t wealthy city in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. Its cir|cuit is between five and &s;ix Italian miles; but the length of it greatly exceeds the breadth, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to re&s;emble a &s;hip, the tower of A&s;inelli be|ing the ma&s;t. The number of inhabitants, in this city, is &s;aid to be ninety thou&s;and; but the whole di&s;|trict, which includes three hundred and eight cities, towns, and villages, contains three hundred and eighty thou&s;and inhabitants. The ancient name of this city was Fal&s;ina, from <HI>Fal&s;inus,</HI> a Tu&s;can king, who is &s;up|po&s;ed to have built it, five and twenty years before the foundation of Rome. The name of Bononia is, by &s;ome, derived from a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of <HI>Fal&s;inus,</HI> named
<PB N="76" REF="78">
<HI>Bonus;</HI> but others derive it from the <HI>Boji.</HI> This city had, for a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, retained a kind of li|berty, under the Emperor of Germany, till the year 1278; when it was re&s;igned, with re&s;erve of &s;ome pri|vileges, to Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> III. But, from inte&s;tine commotions, and wars with the neighbouring &s;tates, it continued in a fluctuating &s;tate till the pontificate of Pope <HI>Julius</HI> II. who, taking the advantage of the Ve|netian war, made him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of it; and annexed it to the papal dominions, by expelling the family of <HI>Bentivoglio</HI>'s; however, &s;ome of that family are the leading men of the city, even at pre&s;ent. On account of their voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it was, at fir&s;t, &s;tipulated, that the Bologne&s;e &s;hould have the privi|lege of keeping a nuncio at the court of Rome; that no citadel &s;hould be built; and that the effects of citi|zens &s;hould not be liable to confi&s;cation, on any pre|tence whatever. The&s;e conditions have been ob|&s;erved, with a degree of punctuality, and good faith, which many zealous prote&s;tants would not expect, in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>Bologna, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> retains the name of a repub|lic, &s;ends an amba&s;&s;ador to the Pope's court, and the word <HI>libertas</HI> is in&s;cribed on the arms, and coin of the &s;tate; with the flattering capitals S. P. Q. R. The civil government, and police of the town, is allowed to remain in the hands of the magi&s;trates, who are
<PB N="77" REF="79">
cho&s;en by the &s;enate, which formerly con&s;i&s;ted of forty members; but &s;ince the republic came under the protection, as it is called, of the Pope, he thought proper to add ten more; but the whole fifty &s;till re|tain the name of the <HI>Quaranta.</HI> Mankind, in general, are more alarmed by a change of name, in things which they have long regarded with veneration, than by a real change in the nature of the things them&s;elves. The Pope may have had &s;ome good political rea&s;on for augmenting the number of the council to fifty; but he could have none for calling them the council of fifty, if the people cho&s;e rather to call fifty men a&s;&s;embled together, the council of forty. One of the &s;enators pre&s;ides in the &s;enate, and is called the Gon|falonier; from his carrying the &s;tandard <HI>(Gonfalone)</HI> of the republic. He is chief magi&s;trate, is attended by guards, and is con&s;tantly at the palace, or near it, to be ready on any emergency; but he remains only two months in office, and the &s;enators take it by turns.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this appearance of independence, a cardinal legate, from Rome, governs this republic; he is appointed by the Pope, with a vice-legate, and other a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The orders, which the legate i&s;&s;ues, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be with the approbation of the &s;enate. The office, which is of higher dignity than any other, in the gift of the court of Rome, continues for three years; at the expiration of that time, his Holine&s;s either
<PB N="78" REF="80">
appoints a new legate, or continues the old one in of|fice, for three years longer.</P>
<P>This eccle&s;ia&s;tical viceroy lives in great magnifi|cence, and has a numerous &s;uit of pages, equeries, and halberdiers, who attend him in the city. When he goes into the country, he is accompanied by guards on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The Gonfalonier and magi&s;trates regulate all the u&s;ual matters, which regard the police; and decide in common cau&s;es, according to the laws, and ancient forms of the republic; but, in affairs of great import|ance, there is no doubt but the cardinal legate in|fluences deci&s;ions. This mu&s;t be mortifying to the &s;e|nators, and noble families; but is le&s;s felt by the peo|ple in general, who have every appearance of living under a mild, and beneficent government.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Bologna carry on a very con&s;i|derable trade in &s;ilks, and velvets; which are manu|factured here in great perfection. The country pro|duces immen&s;e quantities of oil, wine, flax and hemp; and furni&s;hes all Europe with &s;au&s;ages, macaroni, li|queur, and e&s;&s;ences. The people &s;eem to be indu&s;|trious, and to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their labour; the markets are mo&s;t plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions; fruit is to be had in great variety, and all
<PB N="79" REF="81">
excellent in its kind; the common white wine of the country is a light white wine, of an agreeable ta&s;te. Tho&s;e who are not plea&s;ed with the entertainment they meet with at the inns, in this city, it will be a difficult matter to plea&s;e; they mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a degree of &s;uch nicety, both in their palates and tem|pers, as will render them exceedingly trouble&s;ome to them&s;elves, and others; not only in their travels through Italy, but in their journey through life.</P>
<P>On his arrival at this town, the fir&s;t object which &s;trikes the eye of a &s;tranger is, a noble marble fountain, in the area before the Palazzo Publico. The prin|cipal figure is a &s;tatue of <HI>Neptune,</HI> eleven feet in height; one of his hands is &s;tretched out before him, in the other he holds a trident. The body and limbs are finely proportioned, the anatomy perfect, the charac|ter of the countenance &s;evere and maje&s;tic. This fi|gure of <HI>Neptune,</HI> as well as all the others of boys, dol|phins, and &s;yrens, which &s;urround it, are in bronze. The whole is the workman&s;hip of <HI>Giovanni di Bologna;</HI> and is highly e&s;teemed; yet there &s;eems to be an im|propriety in making water flow in &s;treams, from the brea&s;ts of &s;ea-nymphs, or &s;yrens.</P>
<P>There are a great number of palaces in this city. What is called the public palace is by far the mo&s;t &s;pacious; but not the mo&s;t elegant. In this the car|dinal
<PB N="80" REF="82">
legate is lodged. There are al&s;o apartments for the Gonfalonier; and halls, or chambers, for &s;ome of the courts of ju&s;tice. This building, though of a gloomy and irregular form without, contains &s;ome very magnificent apartments, and a few good pictures.</P>
<P>Over the entrance of this palace is a bronze &s;tatue of a pope. The tiara, and other parts of the papal uniform, are not &s;o favourable to the &s;culptor's ge|nius, as the naked &s;implicity in which <HI>Neptune</HI> ap|pears. A female traveller, however, not extrava|gantly fond of the fine arts, would rather be ob&s;erved admiring the &s;culptor's &s;kill in imitating the folds of the &s;acerdotal robes, than the anatomical accuracy in forming the maje&s;tic proportions of the &s;ea divinity.</P>
<P>Though the nobility of Bologna are not now very rich; many of their palaces are furni&s;hed in a magni|ficent ta&s;te, and contain pictures of great value. The palaces were built, and ornamented, when the propri|etors were richer; and when the fine&s;t works of ar|chitecture, and painting, could be procured on ea&s;ier terms, than at pre&s;ent. The galleries, and apart|ments, are &s;pacious and magnificent; yet there are circum&s;tances, in the mo&s;t &s;plendid, that mu&s;t hurt the eye of tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to that perfect ex|actne&s;s in fini&s;hing, which prevails in Engli&s;h hou&s;es. The gla&s;s of the windows, of &s;ome palaces, is divided
<PB N="81" REF="83">
into little &s;quare panes, which are joined together by lead; and the floors of all are very indifferently laid.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t precious ornaments of the palaces are the paintings, and particularly tho&s;e of the great ma&s;ters in the art, which this city has had the honour to produce. <HI>Raphael</HI> is generally allowed to have ex|celled all painters in the &s;ublimity of his ideas, the grouping of his figures, the beauty of his heads, the elegance of his forms, and the correctne&s;s of his out|lines; yet, in the opinion of &s;ome, he has oftener imi|tated tho&s;e noble ideas of beauty, tran&s;mitted to us by the Greek &s;culptors, than what he &s;aw, or could &s;ee in nature. Tho&s;e who hold this opinion a&s;&s;ert, that the be&s;t ma&s;ters of the Lombard &s;chool &s;tudied, with equal a&s;&s;iduity, the elegance of the antique &s;tatues, and the &s;implicity of nature; and, from this combined atten|tion to both, with geniu&s;es le&s;s &s;ublime, and not &s;o uni|ver&s;al as that of the Roman painters, they have pro|duced works equal, if not &s;uperior, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to his.</P>
<P>Next to Rome it&s;elf, there is, perhaps, no town in the world &s;o rich in paintings as Bologna. The churches and palaces, be&s;ides many admired pieces by other ma&s;ters, are full of the works of the great ma&s;ters, who were natives of this city. The Palazzo
<PB N="82" REF="84">
de Monti in particular, &s;hews the genius of the Italian nobility, for decorating their palaces with collections of painting, and other curio&s;ities; who often abridge them&s;elves of a great many of the conveniences of life, in order to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;omething which attracts the admiration of other people, and e&s;pecially of foreigners. The fir&s;t floor of this grand edifice, con|&s;i&s;ting of above thirty apartments, which are by far the be&s;t, is never, or at lea&s;t very &s;eldom inhabited; and then only for the reception of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;|tinction; the general u&s;e of them being to di&s;play an amazing collection of paintings and other curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>The profu&s;ion of paintings in this city, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> made me curious to know what price the <HI>Caracci,</HI> and their pupils, u&s;ed to put upon their works; which was nothing, when compared to what they bear at pre&s;ent. All the&s;e great painters, working from incli|nation, placed their whole ambition in the perfection of their art, and the judgment of po&s;terity. <HI>Guido</HI> was the only one, who&s;e happine&s;s it was to enjoy the reputation on which he rai&s;ed, without &s;carce know|ing it; a fortune that he did not keep. He had made great progre&s;s in his career, by having early entered on it; he had an a&s;toni&s;hing ea&s;e and readine&s;s, which in his latter days he unfortunately abu&s;ed; and the fortune he accumulated, he owed to the homage paid him on account of his admired talents by foreigners,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
and &s;overeigns. The vexations, enmities, and cro&s;&s;es, which embittered the lives of the&s;e famous men, and actually &s;hortened the days of mo&s;t of them, are facts corroborating the many in&s;tances, that eminent genius and reputation, &s;o far from being productive of hap|pine&s;s, very often proves a misfortune. The <HI>Caracci</HI> might have lived very happy as taylors, but then their names would never have been heard of.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t century, there was at Bologna a man of that calling, who was very famous for his knowledge of pictures, and his &s;kill in di&s;cerning their re&s;pective merits, and the &s;tiles of the different &s;chools and ma&s;ters. This taylor was a very great politician, and his &s;hop was the office of intelligence for all the news which the court of Ver&s;ailles wi&s;hed to have &s;pread in Italy; as a connoi&s;&s;eur in pictures, and a politician. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. allowed him a pen&s;ion; and &s;uch was his zeal for that monarch, that he actually died of the &s;hock he received on the news of the battle of Ramilies.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity of Bologna is one of the mo&s;t an|cient, and mo&s;t celebrated &s;eats of literature in Europe; and the academy for the arts and &s;ciences, founded by Count <HI>Mar&s;igli,</HI> at the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury, is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to engage &s;trangers to vi&s;it this city, if there were nothing more worthy of their curio&s;ity. Here is a mo&s;t valuable library, in three
<PB N="84" REF="86">
&s;pacious rooms, where any per&s;on may &s;tudy, and have the u&s;e of the books four hours every day; al&s;o, apartments for the &s;tudents of &s;culpture, painting, architecture, chemi&s;try, anatomy, a&s;tronomy, and every branch of natural philo&s;ophy. They are all ornamented with de&s;igns, models, in&s;truments, and every kind of apparatus, requi&s;ite for illu&s;trating tho&s;e &s;ciences. There are al&s;o profe&s;&s;ors, who regularly read lectures, and in&s;truct the &s;tudents in tho&s;e va|rious parts of knowledge. There is a hall full of models, in architecture and fortification; a valuable collection of medals, and another of natural curio&s;ities, and a complete collection of &s;pecimens, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tudy of <HI>materia medica,</HI> and every part of natural hi&s;|tory. A gallery of &s;tatues, con&s;i&s;ting of a few originals, and very fine ca&s;ts of the be&s;t &s;tatues in Italy.</P>
<P>Honorary premiums are di&s;tributed every year, among the arti&s;ts, for the be&s;t de&s;igns in painting, &s;culpture and architecture.</P>
<P>The anatomical theatre is adorned with &s;tatues of celebrated phy&s;icians; and, in the mu&s;eum which be|longs to it, are abundance of anatomical preparations; al&s;o, a complete &s;uite of anatomical figures, in wax. There are al&s;o models in wax of particular parts, and of &s;everal of the vi&s;cera of the human body, &s;epa|rately; yet, tho&s;e waxen models could not &s;tand in
<PB N="85" REF="87">
competition with the preparations of the real parts in Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI>'s mu&s;eum. If brought to that te&s;t, the Bologna wax-works, though admirable in their kind, would appear as the be&s;t ca&s;ts of the Vatican, <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Laocoon</HI> would; if placed be&s;ide the originals. Indeed, the real preparations to be &s;een here, are far inferior to tho&s;e of that great anatomi&s;t, who&s;e mu&s;eum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mo&s;t complete, and mo&s;t accurate collection of anatomical preparations, that ever was made by human &s;kill and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The principal church is that of St. <HI>Petronius,</HI> form|ing part of the large irregular &s;quare, in which the fountain, formerly mentioned, &s;tands. It is the large&s;t in Bologna. In the pavement of this church, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> drew his meridian line; and, within the walls of this &s;ame edifice, the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. was crowned. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances may intere&s;t the a&s;tronomer and the hi&s;torian; but, the &s;tatue of a &s;oldier, which &s;tands in one of the chapels, engages the attention of the pious Catholic. This man being at play, and in danger of lo&s;ing all his money, offered up a very fervent prayer to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> for a little better luck; to which &s;he, who never &s;hewed any favour to game&s;ters, turned a deaf ear. When he found that his bad fortune con|tinued, this furious wretch drew his &s;word, and wounded both the Virgin and the infant in her arms. He in&s;tantly, as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, fell to the ground,
<PB N="86" REF="88">
deprived of motion; he was carried to pri&s;on, and condemned to a painful and ignominious death. While he remained under confinement, he came to a proper &s;en&s;e of his wickedne&s;s; and, the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin was &s;o much &s;oftened by his repentance, that &s;he re&s;tored him the u&s;e of his limbs; and, the judges taking the hint, gave him a full pardon. As a &s;atis|factory proof of this memorable event, they &s;hew the identical &s;word with which the a&s;&s;ault was made.</P>
<P>In a dominican convent, &s;ituated on the top of a hill, about three miles from Bologna, is a portrait of the Virgin, by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> According to <HI>Sigoni,</HI> it was brought by a hermit from the church of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> at Con&s;tantinople, in the year 1160; and, &s;ince that time, its power has &s;everal times been manife&s;ted, &s;ay the inhabitants, to the great benefit of the country; on which account it is every year, in the month of May, brought into the city of Bologna, in a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, and carried through the principal &s;treets, attended by every inhabitant, who can afford to pur|cha&s;e a wax taper. During the proce&s;&s;ion, the bells continue ringing, the cannon are fired, and the troops under arms ob&s;erve the &s;ame ceremonies, when the picture pa&s;&s;es, as if it were the commander in chief. The common people imagine the picture is extremely fond of this annual vi&s;it to the town of Bologna; they are convinced, that, if it were not carried, it would
<PB N="87" REF="89">
de&s;cend from the frame, and walk the whole way on foot; but they do not de&s;ire to &s;ee the experiment made, becau&s;e it might di&s;oblige the virgin; and, &s;hould the picture once &s;et out to walk, there is no knowing where it would &s;top.</P>
<P>For the greater convenience of the pilgrims, an arched colonade has been built from the city to the top of the mountain; which, on account of its great length, maybe accounted the mo&s;t remarkable build|ing of that kind in Italy. In the contributions of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums for this colonade, all the trade&s;men &s;eemed to vie with each other in the erection of a per|petual monument of their zeal for the ble&s;&s;ed virgin; even the very lacqueys of the city, were at the expence of building fifteen of the arches. Every arch is about twelve feet wide, which is the breadth of the walk. The height is above &s;ixteen feet. This arcade does not run in a &s;trait line, but is now and then interrupted with &s;mall windings; however, in many parts of it, there are very long vi&s;tas, particularly at the grand portico near the city; from which, one has a view of ninety-three arches in a direct line. There are thirty-three flights of &s;teps to a&s;cend the acclivity of the mountain; three flights con&s;i&s;t of a few &s;teps, and the &s;pace between is level, and paved with flat &s;tones.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">The hou&s;es, in mo&s;t of the principal &s;treets, have before them a kind of portico, which &s;upports the &s;econd &s;tory. The&s;e mu&s;t be allowed to be very con|venient in windy or rainy weather, and in &s;hading the hou&s;es from the &s;un; but they deprive them of that ornament which they would receive from a fine front, or an elegant entrance. As the pillars of the&s;e por|ticos are very irregular, &s;ome being very high, others very low; &s;ome round, &s;ome &s;quare, others octangu|lar; &s;ome of &s;tone, and others again of wood; they are no very great ornaments to the city. The&s;e por|ticos, or galleries, &s;erve only for walking; and that part of the &s;treets where the carriages pa&s;s, is con&s;ide|rably lower. The roofs of the hou&s;es are of tiles, but flat, with a kind of parapet towards the &s;treets.</P>
<P>The tower degli A&s;inelli is, by &s;ome, but erro|neou&s;ly, &s;aid to be the highe&s;t in all Italy; for the cupola of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at Rome far exceeds it. The report of a hamper of gilt iron, hanging out of this tower, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to confe&s;&s;ors, is al&s;o without foun|dation. A monk, for divulging &s;ome particulars con|fe&s;&s;ed to him, having, as the &s;tory goes, been put into this hamper, and left to peri&s;h. This tower is &s;quare, and the &s;teps, by which it is a&s;cended, are of wood. It derives its name from <HI>Gerardo A&s;inelli;</HI> who built it at his own expence, in 1109. It is a common &s;aying here, that from the tower of <HI>A&s;inelli,</HI> one has a view
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of <HI>cento e cinque Citt&agrave;, i. e.</HI> a hundred and five cities. But this is no more than a pun upon the word <HI>Cento,</HI> the name of a &s;mall town near Bologna. A &s;imilar pun we hear in France, concerning the pro&s;pect from a mountain near the village of Trente, between Be|ziers and Narbonne, viz. <HI>Jai vu d'une montagne, Trente et deux villes; i. e.</HI> I have &s;een from the top of a mountain, two and thirty cities; but it means no more than that I have &s;een the village Trente, and two cities; Trente being the French word for thirty.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>A&s;inelli</HI> tower, is another, the inclination of which, on one &s;ide, is &s;uch, that a plumb line, let down from the top, falls &s;even feet from the wall at the bottom. This, however, is not the only leaning tower in Italy, as we have already remarked.</P>
<P>The Bologne&s;e ladies dre&s;s entirely in the French fa&s;hion. The women, of the middle cla&s;s, generally appear in a black gown, with a black &s;ilk veil over their heads; but the female &s;ex here, in general, enjoy greater freedom than in mo&s;t cities of Italy. We meet not a few per&s;ons walking the &s;treets with &s;pec|tacles on, who are yet &s;o far from labouring under any weakne&s;s of &s;ight, that they roll their eyes about, on all &s;ides, without once looking through their gla&s;&s;es. This fa&s;hion is of Spani&s;h origin, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;ign of greater gravity than ordinary, which has re|commended
<PB N="90" REF="92">
it to the generality of the monks and clergy.</P>
<P>The Bologne&s;e are famous for their vivacity and wit; and particularly for the &s;atyrical poignance of their je&s;ts. However, a &s;tranger no where meets with more civility than in this town. They are very a&s;&s;iduous al&s;o in their application to their &s;everal trades and manu|factures. The nuns of this city are very ingenious in making mo&s;t beautiful artificial flowers of &s;ilver, &s;ilk, mu&s;lin, enamel, i&s;ingla&s;s, &amp;c. And, though the be&s;t &s;ort of flowers are made only for pre&s;ents, yet abun|dance of them are to be met with in the &s;hops, where travellers may buy them at a moderate price. Fruits, of all kinds, are al&s;o imitated in wax, &s;o as &s;carcely to be di&s;cerned, at fir&s;t &s;ight, from the products of nature.</P>
<P>Formerly little dogs, of the Bologna breed, brought no incon&s;iderable &s;ums to this city; but, at pre&s;ent, the ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e animals is &s;o far ex|ploded, that even in Bologna it&s;elf, by the decrea&s;e of the breed, they are become &s;o &s;carce, that one of any tolerable beauty is valued at four or five guineas. It is &s;aid, the means u&s;ed for checking the growth of the&s;e creatures is, to rub their legs and backs, as &s;oon as they are brought forth, with &s;pirits of wine, and afterwards frequently to repeat the operation. If this be true,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
the effect mu&s;t ari&s;e from the heat of the liquor, which dries up the vital juices; and, po&s;&s;ibly, this recipe may be better grounded than the one publi&s;hed at Liep&s;ick, in 1670, among the <HI>Mi&s;cellanea curio&s;a medico phy&s;ica,</HI> viz. that if you anoint the back bone of a new-born infant, with the fat of rats, moles, and bats, it will never exceed the &s;tature of a &s;mall dwarf.</P>
<P>Many ingenious articles are here made of walnut-tree; for the country abounds with the&s;e trees. The quinces, which grow here, are al&s;o very large, and of an exqui&s;ite flavour. Bologna is likewi&s;e celebrated for its <HI>Theriaca,</HI> which is openly, and with no &s;mall &s;o|lemnity, prepared in the public laboratory; and, ano|ther alexipharmic highly e&s;teemed, which is called <HI>Electuario di Martino.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Republic of Lucca.</HEAD>
<P>THE republic of Lucca is not above thirty Italian miles in circumference; but the fertility of the &s;oil, and the mildne&s;s of the government, have been &s;uch attractive inducements, for &s;ettling here; that the inhabitants of the city, and the hundred and fifty vil|lages belonging to it, are computed to be, in number, one hundred and twenty thou&s;and; of which thirty thou&s;and are able to carry arms. Nothing, however, but foreign &s;upport can prevent Lucca from coming under the &s;ubjection of the great Duke of Tu&s;cany; who has already found means to &s;urround it, on all &s;ides, with his territories. Plau&s;ible pretences for a quarrel will frequently ari&s;e, not only from di&s;putes about limits, but from the ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of the Luc|que&s;e to acknowledge the family of the <HI>Medicis,</HI> great Dukes of Tu&s;cany; allowing them only the title of Dukes of Tu&s;cany. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, a univer&s;al concord and harmony is nece&s;&s;ary, for tran&s;mitting to
<PB N="93" REF="95">
po&s;terity the ble&s;&s;ings of their darling godde&s;s <HI>Liberty;</HI> who&s;e name they bear on their arms, and who&s;e image is not only impre&s;&s;ed on their coins, but al&s;o on the city gates; and on all the public buildings.</P>
<P>The city is three Italian miles in circumference, and is fortified with eleven ba&s;tions; which, with the other works, are planted with two hundred and eighty pieces of cannon. The ramparts are very plea&s;ant; being planted all round with four rows of trees, and in &s;ome parts with more. The country, in which this city &s;tands, is a delicious plain; terminated, on all &s;ides, by a chain of mountains. The &s;kill, and indu&s;-of the inhabitants, in their &s;ilk, and other manufactures, have gained this city the honourable epithet of <HI>indu&s;|du&s;trio&s;a,</HI> or, the indu&s;trious. The &s;mall kind of olives, which grow here, are excellent; and the oil, they produce, accounted the be&s;t in all Italy. The city, according to <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> contains about forty-four thou&s;and inhabitants; others, however, reckon not not more than half that number. They are much to be commended for their candour, politene&s;s, and chearfulne&s;s. Here are &s;een more young women in the &s;treets, &s;hops, churches, and &s;chools, than in any other part of Italy. Their police is very commend|able, and great attention is &s;hewn to &s;uppre&s;s luxury, &s;uperfluous magnificence, and &s;uch di&s;&s;ipations as of|ten prove &s;o de&s;tructive to families, where no &s;uch re|&s;traint
<PB N="94" REF="96">
takes place. On entering the city, travellers mu&s;t deliver up their fire-arms; but it is only inform|ing the guard, at what gate they intend to go out, when they leave the city, and they are &s;ure to find them there; they are likewi&s;e allowed to wear their &s;words, for three days; but, afterwards, mu&s;t have a particular licence, which generally is granted only to per&s;ons of high rank. No commoner, though he be one of the council, mu&s;t appear with a &s;word; and no &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Strangers never fail to be welcomed here with an evening &s;erenade; which is accompanied with an humble intimation, that they would be plea&s;ed to make &s;ome returns for &s;uch an honour. The hou&s;es are, generally, well built, and the &s;treets well paved, and broad; but mo&s;t of them irregular.</P>
<P>The palace of the republic is large, and &s;pacious; without any thing curious, unle&s;s it be an ar&s;enal, which makes a part of it; and has always arms in rea|dine&s;s for twenty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>On a monument in one of the churches is the following in&s;cription.</P>
<Q>Hic jacet corpus S. Ricardi, regis Anglioe.</Q>
<Q>"Here lies the body of S. Richard, king of England.</Q>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">But how the body, of any of the kings of England, came here, is what the hi&s;tory of the country does not mention.</P>
<P>Their council of &s;tate is compo&s;ed of a Doge, and nine &s;enators: who are all members of the great coun|cil, and are changed every two months, The&s;e coun|&s;ellors, who are called Elders, bear the title of Mo&s;t Excellent; and, whil&s;t in office, live in the republic palace, and their expences are defrayed at the charge of the &s;tate; but when they go abroad, on their own private concerns, it mu&s;t be <HI>incognito,</HI> and in a clo&s;e &s;edan, with the curtains drawn. A Doge is not ca|pable of being re-elected, till the expiration of &s;even years. The great council, above-mentioned, con&s;i&s;ts of one hundred and thirty of the nobility, and one hundred and ten commoners, who are changed every two years. The palace-guard is a corps of &s;eventy-five Swi&s;s; and the re&s;t of the republic's forces may con&s;i&s;t of about five hundred men. Its ordinary revenue is computed at about eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Grand Duchy of Tu&s;cany.</HEAD>
<P>THIS duchy borders on the Mediterranean; which, in the&s;e parts, receives its name from this duchy; al&s;o on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, the duchy of Modena, and the republic of Lucca. Some &s;mall detached parts, belonging to it, lie among the terri|tories of Modena, Lucca, and Genoa. The&s;e parcels excepted, its extent, from North to South, is one hun|dred and &s;ixteen Engli&s;h miles; and, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, about eighty miles. The population is e&s;ti|mated at a million of inhabitants.</P>
<P>The great variety of hills and vallies, ri&s;ing grounds and plains, renders the country very plea&s;ant. The &s;oil is kind and fertile; abounding in grain, lemons, oranges, and all other &s;orts of fruits; be&s;ides oil, and excellent wine. The pa&s;tures al&s;o are very rich. The oil, however, bears little proportion to the mul|titude of olive-trees, which are &s;ubject to a di&s;temper

&s;hewing it&s;elf in knots, and tubercles, occa&s;ioned by worms. Be&s;ides that wine, known in England by the name of Florence, and which is the ordinary drink of the inhabitants, they have a white fort; much better, extremely light, and delicate to the ta&s;te. The trees, mo&s;t common here, are the cypre&s;s and the pine; the latter produces a kind of almond, or kernel, very good to eat; when pounded in a mortar, and mixed with the pulp of the white codlin, it forms a pa&s;te, ex|ceedingly good to wa&s;h the hands with. The wood is very re&s;inous; and, if chipped, whil&s;t green, and boiled till one half of the water is con&s;umed, when u&s;ed as a bath, or fomentation, hot as it can be borne, proves excellent for &s;prains, wrenches, or any com|mon rheumatic pains in the limbs.</P>
<P>The vines, in this country, &s;ays <HI>Smollet,</HI> are not planted in rows, and proped with &s;ticks, as in France; but twine around the hedge-row trees, nearly covering them with their foliage and fruit. The branches of the vine are extended from tree to tree; exhibiting beautiful fe&s;toons of real leaves, tendrils, and &s;welling clu&s;ters, a foot long. By this economy, the ground of the enclo&s;ure is &s;pared for corn, gra&s;s, or any other production. Might not the &s;ame method be adapted in this country, with equal &s;ucce&s;s, in regard to hops? The trees, commonly planted for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;|taining the vines, are, maple, elm, and elder; with
<PB N="98" REF="101">
which la&s;t, the banks of the Arno abound. This ri|ver, which is very con&s;iderable, with re&s;pect to the quantity of water, would be a charming pa&s;toral &s;tream, if it was tran&s;parent; but it is always muddy, and di&s;coloured.</P>
<P>This duchy abounds in minerals; but the mines are not much worked, except in the i&s;land of Elba, remarkable for its fine iron ore. The air of &s;everal places, as of Pi&s;a, Volterra, Chiu&s;a, and Ma&s;&s;a, is un|healthy, on account of the many fens, and wild de&s;art places. In &s;ome parts manna is gathered from the a&s;h and elm. It oozes out on taking off the rind, and and con&s;equently is not a production of the air, but of the tree. The bees carry off a great deal of it; the remainder is applied, in Tu&s;cany, to medicinal u&s;es; and, in France, for giving a glo&s;s to cloth.</P>
<P>On the borders of the territory of Lucca, near Pi&s;a, are &s;ome hot &s;prings, which are in great vogue. There are others, in different parts of this duchy, the heat of which much exceeds that of boiling water. The famous Tetruchio water is, properly a brine, and celebrated for its virtues in a diarrhaea.</P>
<P>The principal river in this country is the Arno, which ri&s;es in the Apennine mountains, in the terri|tory of Florence, and falls into the &s;ea below Pi&s;a.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">The whole face of Tu&s;cany, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> is covered with farm-hou&s;es, and cottages; an object very rare in the dominions of the Pope, and the king of Naples; but the cottages here, and indeed through all Italy, are not, as in France and England, thatched huts, with walls of mud; they are built of &s;tone, or brick; and, to outward appearance, &s;hould contain richer inhabi|tants than, in fact, they do.</P>
<P>A &s;triking circum&s;tance, though a trivial one, offers it&s;elf, on fir&s;t entering the Grand Duke's territories; and this is the ingenious method of figuring their mile|&s;tones; which might be imitated to good effect in England, as time and weather have a tendency to obliterate the figures cut in coar&s;e &s;tone; and, what is wor&s;e, as idle boys, in all parts of the world, are apt to make it an amu&s;ement to deface the figures of mile|&s;tones, and de&s;troy, by that very practice, the u&s;e of them; the Florentines let into the figures a &s;mall &s;lip, or bar, of iron, which is fa&s;tened with &s;older, in the u&s;ual manner plumbers fix iron in &s;tone; by this means the figures on the &s;tones remain legible, almo&s;t for ever; (or, at lea&s;t, would do &s;o, if the iron were painted black, once in two or three years) and the dif|ficulty of breaking them to pieces di&s;courages the attempt.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the City of Florence.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of Florence lies in a fruitful valley, on the river Arno, one hundred and twenty miles north of Rome, in a mo&s;t delightful &s;ituation, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with beautifull hills on three &s;ides; full of vil|lages, country-&s;eats, gardens, groves, and woods of olives, ri&s;ing gradually, till they join the highe&s;t moun|tains of the Apennines; and towards the we&s;t is that rich valley, watered by the river Arno, which extends as far as Pi&s;a; abounding in corn, wine, oil, and all manner of delicious fruits.</P>
<P>The Florentines pride them&s;elves &s;o much on the beauty of their city, that they imagine nothing can equal it; and, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> it unque&s;tionably is a very beautiful city. Independent of the churches and pa|laces, &s;ome of which are very magnificent, the archi|tecture of the hou&s;es, in general, is in a good ta&s;te; the &s;treets are remarkably clean, and paved with large
<PB N="101" REF="104">
broad &s;tones, chi&s;&s;elled &s;o as to prevent the hor&s;es from &s;liding. This city is divided into two unequal parts, by the river Arno; over which there are no le&s;s than four bridges, in &s;ight of each other. That called the <HI>ponte della Trinita</HI> is uncommonly elegant. It is built entirely of white marble, and ornamented with four beautiful &s;tatues, repre&s;enting the four &s;ea|&s;ons. The quays, and buildings on each &s;ide, and the bridges, render that part of Florence, through which the river pa&s;&s;es, by far the fine&s;t. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e at Paris; and it happens, fortunately for the&s;e two cities, that the&s;e parts are, almo&s;t, con&s;tantly be|fore the eye, on account of the nece&s;&s;ity people are under of pa&s;&s;ing, and re-pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e bridges; where|as in London, who&s;e river, and bridges, are far &s;upe|rior to any in France, or Italy, people may live whole &s;ea&s;ons, attend all the public amu&s;ements, and drive every day, from one end of the town to the other, without ever &s;eeing the Thames, or the bridges, un|le&s;s they go on purpo&s;e. For this rea&s;on, when a fo|reigner is a&s;ked which he thinks the fine&s;t city, Paris or London? The moment Paris is mentioned, the Louvre, and that &s;triking part, which is &s;ituated be|tween Pont-royal and Pont-neuf, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to his imagination. He can recollect no part of London equal, in magnificence, to this; and ten to one, if he decides directly, it will be in favour of Paris; but, if he takes a little more time, and compares the two ca|pitals,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
&s;treet by &s;treet, &s;quare by &s;quare, and bridge by bridge, he will probably be of a different opinion. The number of inhabitants, in Florence, is calculated at eighty thou&s;and. The &s;treets, &s;quares, and fronts of the palaces, are adorned with a great number of &s;tatues; &s;ome of them by the be&s;t ma&s;ters. A ta&s;te for the arts mu&s;t be kept alive, independent, almo&s;t, of any other encouragement, in a city where &s;o many &s;pecimens are continually before the the eyes of the inhabitants. There are towns in Europe where &s;ta|tues, expo&s;ed night and day, within the reach of the common people, would run a greater ri&s;k of being disfigured, and mutilated; here they are as &s;afe as if they were &s;hut up in the Great Duke's gallery.</P>
<P>The number of &s;tatues, which ornament the &s;treets and &s;quares of Florence, amount, in all, to above one hundred and fifty; many of them of exqui&s;ite work|man&s;hip, and admired by tho&s;e of the be&s;t ta&s;te. Such a number of &s;tatues, without any drapery, continually expo&s;ed to the public eye, with the far greater num|ber of pictures, as well as &s;tatues, in the &s;ame ta&s;te, to be &s;een in the palaces, have produced, in both &s;exes, the mo&s;t perfect in&s;en&s;ibility to nudities.</P>
<P>Ladies, who have remained &s;ome time at Rome, or Florence, particularly tho&s;e who affect a ta&s;te for <HI>virt&ugrave;,</HI> acquire an intrepidity, and a cool minutene&s;s, in ex|amining
<PB N="103" REF="106">
and critici&s;ing naked figures, which is un|known to tho&s;e who have never pa&s;&s;ed the Alps. There is &s;omething in the figure of the god of gardens, which is apt to alarm the mode&s;ty of a novice; but there are female <HI>dilettant&iacute;,</HI> who think little of it.</P>
<P>Florence has been equally di&s;tingui&s;hed, by a &s;pirit for commerce, and the fine arts; two things which are not always united. Some of the Florentine mer|chants, formerly, were men of va&s;t wealth, and lived in a mo&s;t magnificent manner. One of them, about the middle of the fifteenth century, built that noble fabric, which, from the name of its founder, is called the <HI>Palazzo Pitti.</HI> The man was ruined by the pro|digious expence of the building; which was immedi|ately purcha&s;ed by the <HI>Medici</HI> family; and has conti|nued ever &s;ince to be the re&s;idence of the &s;overeigns. The gardens, belonging to this palace, are on the declivity of an eminence. On the &s;ummit there is a kind of fort, called Belvidere. From this, and from &s;ome of the higher walks, is &s;een a complete view of the city of Florence, and the beauteous vale of Arno, in the middle of which it &s;tands. The pro&s;pect is bounded, on every &s;ide, by an amphitheatre of fertile hills, adorned with country hou&s;es, and gardens.</P>
<P>The furniture of this palace is rich and curious; particularly &s;ome tables of Florentine work, which are
<PB N="104" REF="107">
much admired. The mo&s;t precious ornaments, how|ever, are the paintings. The walls of, what is called, the imperial chamber, are painted in fre&s;co, by various painters; the &s;ubjects are allegorical, and in honour of <HI>Lorenzo de Medicis;</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Magnificent. There is more fancy than ta&s;te di&s;|played in the paintings. The other principal rooms are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Heathen Deities; as Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Venus; and by paintings in fre&s;co, mo&s;tly by <HI>Pietro di Cortona.</HI> In the la&s;t men|tioned, the &s;ubjects are different from what is naturally expected from the name of the room; being repre&s;en|tations of the triumphs of Virtue over Love, or &s;ome memorable in&s;tance of continence. As the <HI>Medicis</HI> family have been more di&s;tingui&s;hed for the protection they afforded the arts, than for the virtues of conti|nence, and &s;elf-denial, it is probable the &s;ubject, as well as the execution, of the&s;e pieces, was left entirely to the painter.</P>
<P>In no part of Italy are there &s;o many villas, belong|ing to private per&s;ons, as in the neighbourhood of this city. The country, all around, is divided into &s;mall farms, with a neat farm, hou&s;e on each.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to curio&s;ities, worthy the attention of a traveller, Florence, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> exceeds every city in Italy; Rome, alone, excepted. It is generally
<PB N="105" REF="108">
&s;tiled, by the Italians, <HI>la bella,</HI> or, the beautiful; an epithet it probably owes to the cleanline&s;s of the &s;treets, and goodne&s;s of the pavement; the palaces here being neither &s;o many, nor &s;o &s;tately, as to put it on a level with Rome, Turin, or even Genoa. The &s;treets are for the mo&s;t part narrow and winding; and the former is too much the fault in the Cor&s;o, which is &s;aid to be two Italian miles in length; &s;o that, in &s;everal of the &s;treets, which are included in that quarter, there is not breadth enough for a car|riage to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>There are, however, &s;ome beautiful palaces in Flo|rence; and, as <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> pillars, and <HI>ru&s;tic</HI> work, owe their origin to this country, the architects always take care to give them a place in the great edifices, that are rai&s;ed in Tu&s;cany. The <HI>Palazzo Pitti,</HI> and that we have ju&s;t noticed, is built after this manner; which makes it look extremely &s;olid, and maje&s;tic. It is not unlike the Luxemburg, at Paris, built by <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medici;</HI> and for that rea&s;on, perhaps, the workmen fell into the Tu&s;can humour. I found, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> in the court of this palace, what I could not meet with any where in Rome. I mean an antique &s;tatue of <HI>Hercules,</HI> lifting up <HI>Antaeus</HI> from the earth. It was found in Rome, and brought here under the reign of <HI>Leo</HI> X. There are abundance of pictures in this palace, by the hands of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">But it is in the famous gallery of the old palace that, perhaps, the noble&s;t collections are to be met with, in any part of the world. The gallery it&s;elf is made in the &s;hape of an L, according to <HI>La&s;&s;el;</HI> but, if it mu&s;t needs be like a letter, remarks <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> it re&s;embles the Greek 11 mo&s;t. It is adorned with ad|mirable pieces of &s;culpture; as well modern as anci|ent. One of the mo&s;t in&s;tructing parts of it, in the eyes of many, is the &s;eries of Roman emperors from <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Gallienus;</HI> with a con&s;iderable num|ber of their empre&s;&s;es ranged oppo&s;ite to them. This &s;eries is almo&s;t complete; but, wherever the bu&s;t of an emperor is wanting, the place is filled up, by that of &s;ome other di&s;tingui&s;hed Roman. Such an honour is be&s;towed, with great propriety, on <HI>Seneca, Cicero,</HI> or <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the &s;on-in-law of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> But, on per|ceiving a head of <HI>Antinous,</HI> the favourite of <HI>Adrian,</HI> it was remarked, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> that this bu&s;t would not have been admitted, into &s;uch company, any where but in Florence. It ought, however, to be remem|bered, that the gallery is not an Egyptian court of ju|dicature; where princes are tried after death, for crimes committed during their life. If the vices of originals had excluded their portraits, what would have become of the &s;eries of Roman emperors; and, particularly, of the great <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar</HI> him&s;elf; of who&s;e intrigues, and debaucheries, hi&s;tory has given us &s;o flagrant a de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110">Amid&s;t the&s;e noble &s;pecimens of ancient art, &s;ome of the works of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> are not thought un|de&s;erving a place. His <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Faunus,</HI> of which the well-known &s;tory is told, have been, by &s;ome, preferred to the two antique figures repre&s;enting the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This &s;tory, to &s;uch of our readers as are unac|quainted with it, may, perhaps, not be unacceptable: it is related as follows. When <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>'s re|putation had ri&s;en to a great height, his adver&s;aries, envious of his fame, had no other way to le&s;&s;en it, than by comparing his works to the antique; and en|deavouring to &s;hew how far he fell &s;hort of the anci|ents. He took the re&s;olution of putting the &s;kill of his judges to the te&s;t, and made this <HI>Bacchus.</HI> When the work was perfected, he broke off the right hand, which holds a cup, and laid it by in his clo&s;et; the re&s;t of the figure he buried, and let it lie &s;ome time in the ground. At a proper opportunity the workmen were ordered to dig, as for other purpo&s;es, in another part of the ground; and to carry on their work &s;o, that they mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, come to the place where the &s;tatue was hid. They did &s;o, and found it; and, by direction, mentioned it in &s;uch a manner, that it might come to the ears of his adver&s;aries, who were not long in going to view the new di&s;covery; and, when they had clean&s;ed the earth from it, found a fine group
<PB N="108" REF="111">
of a <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Faunus,</HI> all entire, except one hand, which was wanting to the <HI>Bacchus.</HI> They in&s;tantly judged it to be a fine antique; the di&s;covery was &s;oon noi&s;ed about, and, among the re&s;t who flocked to &s;ee it, came <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> him&s;elf. He was not &s;o loud in its prai&s;es as the re&s;t were. "Well," &s;ays one of them, "you can make as good a one, no doubt." He laughed with them a little time; and at la&s;t a&s;ked them, "What will you &s;ay if I made this?" It may ea&s;ily be imagined how the que&s;tion was re|ceived. He then only de&s;ired their patience whil&s;t he &s;tepped home, which he did, and brought back with him the hand he had broken off; which, upon application, was found to tally <HI>exactly</HI> with the arm.</P>
<P>The beautiful head of <HI>Alexander</HI> is al&s;o univer&s;ally admired, by all the <HI>virtuo&s;i;</HI> though they differ in opi|nion, in regard to the circum&s;tances, in which the &s;culptor has intended to repre&s;ent that hero. Some imagine he is dying; Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> thinks he &s;ighs for new worlds to conquer; others, that he faints with pain and lo&s;s of blood, from the wounds he received at Oxydrace. Some think the features expre&s;s, not bodily pain, or languor; but &s;orrow, and remor&s;e, for having murdered his faithful friend <HI>Clitus.</HI></P>
<P>The famous bu&s;t of <HI>Alexander</HI> appeared to me, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> to expre&s;s more of the &s;entiment of in|dignation,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
and reproach, in the countenance, than of a &s;en&s;ation proceeding from bodily pain, though it is here &s;tyled <HI>Alexander dying;</HI> the features are ex|tremely hand&s;ome, and wonderfully intere&s;ting; and the whole character noble.</P>
<P>The unfini&s;hed bu&s;t of <HI>Marcus Brutus,</HI> by <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> admirably expre&s;&s;es the determined firmne&s;s of character which belonged, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to that vir|tuous Roman.</P>
<P>Among the bu&s;ts of the emperors and empre&s;&s;es, there are &s;ome which are very &s;carce, and almo&s;t &s;in|gular, in their kind; and I have generally ob&s;erved, at Rome, remarks <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> which is a great magazine of the&s;e antiquities; that the &s;ame heads, which are rare in medals, are al&s;o rare in marble; and, indeed, we may commonly a&s;&s;ign the &s;ame rea&s;on for both; which was, the &s;hortne&s;s of the emperors' reigns, that did not give the workmen time to make many of their figures; and, as the &s;hortne&s;s of their reigns was ge|nerally occa&s;ioned by the advancement of a rival, it is no wonder that no one worked on the figure of a decea&s;ed emperor, when his rival was on the throne. Among other antique figures, there is a fine one of <HI>Morpheus,</HI> in touch&s;tone. This god is repre&s;ented, by the ancient &s;tatuaries, under the figure of a boy a&s;leep, with a bundle of poppy in his hand. Tis probable, they
<PB N="110" REF="113">
cho&s;e to repre&s;ent the god of &s;leep, under the figure of a boy, contrary to all modern de&s;igners; becau&s;e, it is that age which has its repo&s;e the lea&s;t broken by cares and anxieties. <HI>Statius,</HI> in his celebrated invocation to &s;leep, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him under the &s;ame figure.</P>
<Q>Crimine quo merui, juvenis placidi&s;&s;ime Div&ucirc;m.

<P>I would mo&s;t willingly pay the tribute of my prai&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to that charming figure, known by the name of the <HI>Venus de Medicis.</HI> Yet, in the mid&s;t of all my admiration, I confe&s;s I do not think her equal to her brother <HI>Apollo</HI> in the Vatican. In that &s;ublime figure, to the mo&s;t perfect features and proportion, is joined an air, which &s;eems more than human. The <HI>Medicean Venus</HI> is, unque&s;tionably, a perfect model of female beauty; but, while <HI>Apollo</HI> appears more than a man, the <HI>Venus</HI> &s;eems preci&s;ely a beautiful woman.</P>
<P>This &s;tatue, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> &s;eems much le&s;s than the life, as being perfectly naked, and in company with others of a larger make; Lady <HI>Millar</HI> mea&s;ured it, and found it not more than four feet ten inches in height. The &s;oftne&s;s of the fle&s;h, the delicacy of the &s;hape, air, and po&s;ture, and the correctne&s;s of de&s;ign, in this &s;tatue, are inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="114">This <HI>chef d'oeuvre,</HI> or &s;tandard for female beauty, was found in the villa Adriana, among&s;t more than thirty-eight Greek &s;tatues of admirable workman&s;hip: the in|&s;cription on the pede&s;tal, importing her to have been formed by <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> an Athenian, &s;on of <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> has been evidently in&s;erted at the time her arms were &s;upplied.

<P>In the &s;ame room, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> are many other ex|cellent &s;tatues, be&s;ides a collection of admirable pic|tures, by the be&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>

&s;tatue, which divides the admiration of the amateurs with that in the Borghe&s;e villa at Rome. The excel|lence of the execution, is di&s;graced by the vilene&s;s of the &s;ubject. We are &s;urprized how the Greeks and Romans could take plea&s;ure in &s;uch unnatural figures; in this particular, their ta&s;te &s;eems to have been as depraved, as, in general, it was elegant and refined.</P>
<P>The large room, called the gallery of portraits, is not the lea&s;t curious in this va&s;t mu&s;eum. It contains the portraits, all executed by them&s;elves, of the mo&s;t eminent painters who have flouri&s;hed in Europe, during the three la&s;t centuries. They amount to above two hundred; tho&s;e of <HI>Rubens, Vandyke, Rembrandt,</HI> and <HI>Guido,</HI> were formerly the mo&s;t e&s;teemed; two have been &s;ince added, which vie with the fine&s;t in this collection&mdash;tho&s;e of <HI>Mengs</HI> and Sir <HI>Jo&s;hua Rey|nolds.</HI> The portrait of <HI>Raphael</HI> &s;eems to have been done when he was young; it is not equal to any of the above.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Millar</HI> mentions having &s;een in one of the rooms, a variety of &s;ummer and winter rings, worn by the ancient Romans, &s;ome of which were entire with the &s;tones &s;till in their &s;etting. The greater part were <HI>intaglios;</HI> but among them were &s;ome <HI>cameos.</HI> There were &s;everal which opened, and the cavity under the gem was &s;ufficiently large to receive as much matter
<PB N="113" REF="116">
as might be contained in the bowl of a tea-&s;poon; probably, the&s;e cavities were de&s;igned to hold poi&s;on. Some of the hoops of the&s;e rings were &s;o large, adds Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> to admit with ea&s;e four of my fingers.</P>
<P>The abb&eacute;, who was the late guardian of the&s;e pre|cious depots, and of the gallery, &s;tole and di&s;po&s;ed of antique idols, gems, &amp;c. and twenty-four pounds weight of pure gold, the ornaments of columns, &amp;c. of near the value of five thou&s;and pounds, to Jew brokers. He was taken, tried, and condemned to be hanged and embowelled; yet, after eight months im|pri&s;onment, humanely pardoned, but bani&s;hed the Grand Duke's territories; and is, at this time, &s;aid to &s;erve as a private &s;oldier in the Neapolitan troops.</P>
<P>The remarkable diamond, that u&s;ed to be &s;hewn here, has been removed from the Tribuna, to the Duke's private cabinet; but an exact model, made of yellowi&s;h gla&s;s, now &s;upplies the place of it. The original, according to <HI>Tavernier,</HI> weighs one hundred and forty carrats, and was the large&s;t diamond in Europe, till Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> brought from the Ea&s;t-Indies, a diamond which exceeded it, which was &s;old to the re|gent of France, and was the mo&s;t co&s;tly and &s;uperb jewel belonging to that crown. The &s;parks, which fell from it in cutting, produced him &s;ix thou&s;and pounds; and, when cut, be&s;ides its extraordinary weight of one
<PB N="114" REF="117">
hundred and forty-four carrats, was of a finer water than any diamond that could be produced; whereas, the Florentine diamond is of a yellowi&s;h water. The Great Duke, is &s;aid to have bought his of a Je&s;uit for 75,000 crowns; but, the father had an exorbitant profit, having given only a &s;ingle &s;ixpence for it, on the <HI>Piazza di Navona,</HI> when it was offered to &s;ale as a bit of cry&s;tal. Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> might have di&s;po&s;ed of his diamond to much greater advantage, had he not out|&s;tood his market with the King of Poland, who offered him 800,000 dollars; and the &s;tates of Saxony were to give &s;ecurity for the payment of that &s;um, by &s;e|veral payments, within a few years. Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon a million, or 225,000l. &s;terling; and the treaty broke off to his great mortification; for, when the King of Poland heard that the King of France had purcha&s;ed the diamond, he is &s;aid to have been di&s;&s;a|tisfied with him&s;elf, that he had not come into Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI>'s terms. Whil&s;t Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> had this diamond about him, he could hardly be &s;aid to be in &s;afety; and, not being able to find a proper purcha&s;er, he, at length, &s;old it to the Regent of France, who was de&s;irous of procuring it for the King; and, this famous diamond, to this day, goes by the appellation of <HI>le Regent.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> however, was obliged to take, by way of ex|change, &s;everal other jewels, at the Paris valuation; and, the bills which he received as ready money, being immediately after involved in the fate of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi
<PB N="115" REF="118">
bonds; it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, in&s;tead of the many mil|lions of French livres, which he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of, the mo&s;t he got for his famous diamond, was about 300,000 dollars, or about &s;ixty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>In a particular clo&s;et in the Tribuna, is &s;een a mo&s;t rich and admirable <HI>&s;tudiolo,</HI> or cabinet, with fourteen beautiful pillars; the &s;hafts of which are of <HI>lapis la|zuli;</HI> but, the pede&s;tals and capital, of &s;olid gold, en|riched with pearl and <HI>turquoi&s;e.</HI> This magnificent ca|binet, &s;erves for keeping gems and intaglios; the whole number of which, in their &s;everal a&s;&s;ortments, amount to three thou&s;and. The cabinet and its con|tents, are valued at &s;ixty thou&s;and crowns; or about one hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ortment of gold coins con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen hun|dred medals, and &s;ixteen <HI>medaillons.</HI> The large&s;t of the latter weighs a hundred and &s;ixteen louis-d'ors, and repre&s;ents the emperor <HI>John Paloeologus</HI> VII. who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Florence. The whole col|lection is compo&s;ed of fourteen thou&s;and antique medals, and eight thou&s;and modern.</P>
<P>The churches in Florence amount to above one hundred and fifty; and the convents to eighty-&s;even;
<PB N="116" REF="119">
be&s;ides twenty-two ho&s;pitals. Among &s;uch a multi|tude of religious edifices, and in a country like this, many of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contain things worth notice.</P>
<P>The cathedral of Florence is a great Gothic build|ing, incru&s;ted on the out&s;ide with marble; remarkable for nothing but its cupola, which is &s;aid to have been copied by the architect of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at Rome; and for its &s;ize, which is much greater than that of any other church in Chri&s;tendom. The bapti&s;tery, which &s;tands by it, was an ancient temple, &s;aid to be dedi|cated to <HI>Mars.</HI> There are &s;ome good &s;tatues of white marble, within; and one or two of bronze, on the out|&s;ide of the doors; but, it is chiefly celebrated for the embo&s;&s;ed work of its bra&s;s gates, which <HI>M. Angelo</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, de&s;erved to be made the gates of Paradi&s;e. It is in this place, that all the children born in the city are bapti&s;ed.</P>
<P>Near the cathedral, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful towers, or &s;teeples, in the world. It is &s;quare, and the out&s;ide is incru&s;ted with black, red, and white marble. This &s;tructure is much admired for its &s;ymmetry and &s;trength; the ornaments are well imagined, and the parts well di&s;po&s;ed. Its height is two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix Engli&s;h feet. There are four hundred
<PB N="117" REF="120">
and eight &s;teps in the a&s;cent, and a noble view of the city from the top of the edifice.</P>
<P>The chapel of St. <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> is, perhaps, the fine&s;t, and mo&s;t expen&s;ive habitation, that ever was rai&s;ed for the dead; it is encru&s;ted with precious &s;tones, and adorned by the workman&s;hip of the be&s;t modern &s;culptors. Some complain, that, after all, it has a gloomy appearance. There &s;eems to be no impropriety in that, con&s;idering what the building was intended for. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has remarked, that this chapel advanced &s;o very &s;lowly, that it was not im|po&s;&s;ible but all the family of the <HI>Medicis</HI> might be extinct, before their burial-place was fini&s;hed. This has actually happened; the <HI>Medicis</HI> family is extinct, and the chapel remains unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mercato nuovo,</HI> is properly the exchange of Florence; where, about noon, the principal mer|chants meet to do bu&s;ine&s;s, many of whom are of great families; for here, as in Genoa, commerce is not held to be in the lea&s;t derogatory to nobility. It is, indeed, the means of keeping up affluence and credit in families; whereas, in other parts, and e&s;pecially in Germany, many families are ruined, or, for a whole century or more, remain in ob&s;cu|rity. It is by commerce, that even the Ducal fa|mily has ri&s;en to that greatne&s;s, in which they have
<PB N="118" REF="121">
maintained them&s;elves above two hundred years. <HI>Co&s;mo de Medicis,</HI> who died in the year 1465, had warehou&s;es in the principal trading cities throughout the world; and met with &s;uch peculiar good fortune, that, in the cour&s;e of fifty-four years, he experienced no con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es, by the failure of other merchants.</P>
<P>The city is not fortified; but, on one &s;ide of the river Arno, there is a good citadel, with five ba&s;tions and two forts; but both in a very ruinous condition. It is &s;aid to be &s;ix miles in circumference. The city appears in its greate&s;t brilliancy at the hor&s;e-races, which are at the end of June.</P>
<P>A particular part of the city, noted for hou&s;es of ill fame, was a&s;&s;igned by <HI>Co&s;mo</HI> I. to the Jews for their particular quarter; and, an in&s;cription at the entrance of the &s;treet, ob&s;erves, that it was thought more advi&s;e|able to permit the Jews to remain in the neighbour|hood of Chri&s;tians; that, by their good example, they might be brought to the ea&s;y yoke of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than to|tally to expel them. The rea&s;on here a&s;&s;igned is &s;o ju&s;t and commendable, that it de&s;erves to be adopted in other parts, with regard to all &s;ectaries.</P>
<P>The environs of Florence are delightful; the plain, in which the city &s;tands, being &s;urrounded by charm|ing hills, well cultivated and adorned. But, though
<PB N="119" REF="122">
Florence be thus in a kind of ba&s;in, the warmth of the &s;outh, and &s;outh-ea&s;t winds is &s;o well tempered, by cooler ones, that people may &s;leep abroad without danger. The autumn here is generally wet; and this city is a bad re&s;idence, in winter, on account of the &s;outh-ea&s;t, or &s;irocco, and north winds, which blow often on the &s;ame day; and &s;ubject the inhabitants to inflammations in the brea&s;t and lungs. Florence therefore is be&s;t in &s;ummer, when the atmo&s;phere about it is e&s;teemed very &s;alubrious.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, remarks <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that few per&s;ons in Flo|rence are known to have the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, in per|fection. This &s;ome naturali&s;ts impute to the foggy moi&s;t air of the city; but, at this rate, mo&s;t of the in|habitants of Mantua, Venice, Leyden, Am&s;terdam, &amp;c. would have but little u&s;e of their eyes. It is ob&s;erv|able that places, near the &s;ea-coa&s;t only, are &s;ubject to &s;uch damp exhalations; whereas Florence &s;tands high, and on a dry &s;oil; and it is to the purity and &s;alubrity of the air, that the Florentines them&s;elves attri|bute the vivacity, and penetration by which they boa&s;t that their countrymen have made &s;uch improvements, in all the polite arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Without the city are two very fine palaces, called <HI>Poggio,</HI> or <HI>Villa Imperiale;</HI> and <HI>Pratolino;</HI> the former is but an Italian mile from the city, in a direct line
<PB N="120" REF="123">
from the <HI>Porta Romana,</HI> with a &s;tately avenue, con&s;i&s;t|ing of a double row of cypre&s;s and larch trees, lead|ing to it; with beautiful vineyards, convents, and villas, on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>Pratolino, the other ducal palace, is &s;ix Italian miles di&s;tant from Florence. The gardens are beautifully fine, with a variety of grand water-works; but the greate&s;t curio&s;ity is a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, fronting the pa|lace, which is intended to &s;ignify the Appennine mountain, and is the work of <HI>John de Bologna,</HI> who has made the &s;tatue appear like a mountain it&s;elf. The figure &s;its in an inclining po&s;ture, as looking into a ba&s;on or pond, ju&s;t below it; and, from its prodi|gious long beard, arms, and other parts, hang, what look like, icicles; the only repre&s;entation that &s;tone could give of water falling from it. The &s;tatue is compo&s;ed of &s;everal great &s;tones, which look very coar&s;e, near the eye, but have a noble effect at a di&s;|tance.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Cities of Leghorn, Pi&s;a, and Sienna.</HEAD>
<P>LEGHORN is a neat, well-built city, &s;ituated on a plain, almo&s;t level with the &s;ea; forty miles We&s;t of Florence; and one hundred and fifty North-we&s;t of Rome.</P>
<P>The great wealth of Tu&s;cany, and the true &s;ource of her power, has been this famous port of Leghorn; or <HI>Livorn,</HI> as the Italians call it; which was obtained from the Genoe&s;e, in exchange for Sarizana, an epi&s;co|pal city, near Lerici, by <HI>Co&s;mo</HI> I. Duke of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>The country about it was formerly a mora&s;s, or bog, who&s;e noxious &s;treams infected the air; but by the &s;kill of Sir <HI>Robert Dudley,</HI> afterwards created Duke of Northumberland, the &s;oil was rendered habitable; the air more healthy, and the port improved, &s;o as to become the be&s;t in Italy. By his advice, al&s;o, it was made a free-port; that is, the duties inward are very
<PB N="122" REF="126">
ea&s;y, and there are no duties on exportation; which have rendered it, for more than a century, the greate&s;t magazine of the Levant trade; and has drawn thither merchants from all parts, particularly Jews and Ar|menians; of whom many re&s;ide there, and have great privileges allowed them.</P>
<P>The number of Jews, at Leghorn, is computed at eighteen thou&s;and, and this city is called their para|di&s;e; for, except living by them&s;elves, in one particu|lar part of it, be reckoned a hard&s;hip, they enjoy all manner of freedom, without any ignominious mark of di&s;tinction. Their trade, which is already very great, is continually increa&s;ing; to the no &s;mall detriment of the chri&s;tian merchants. There is, indeed, an in|qui&s;ition at Leghorn, but without exerci&s;ing any power over the Jews; for it is limitted to the &s;piritual con|concerns of tho&s;e of its own communion. The &s;yna|gogue is large, and well contrived; with abundance of bra&s;s chandeliers in it. For the work which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be done, in their hou&s;es, on the &s;abbath days, the Jews buy young Moori&s;h girls; one of which, according to her age, and other circum&s;tances, may co&s;t forty, or fifty crowns.</P>
<P>Leghorn is &s;aid to contain forty thou&s;and inhabi|tants, including the Jews; but this calculation &s;eems exaggerated, for &s;o &s;mall a city. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets
<PB N="123" REF="127">
are broad and &s;trait. The grand place larger, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> than Lincoln's-inn Fields, makes a fine appearance; from which two vi&s;tas extend through both the city gates. The north part of this city is extremely well-built; and one quarter of it, on ac|count of its many canals, for cleanline&s;s and conve|nience of trade, is called Venice.</P>
<P><HI>Pollnitz</HI> ob&s;erves, that this city is well-built; the &s;treets broad, &s;trait, and light&s;ome, and that &s;everal have canals in them, after the manner of Dutch cities; and that the ports are magnificent. They have good ho&s;pitals for the poor and &s;ick, but none for tho&s;e who are lame, or pa&s;t labour; &s;o that they have a multitude of beggars. The public pro&s;titutes have particular quarters a&s;&s;igned them, and are under very &s;trict regulations. It is &s;aid they even maintain one of the gallies, out of the taxes impo&s;ed on their pro|fe&s;&s;ion. The Briti&s;h factors, who con&s;i&s;t of about forty families, con&s;tantly maintain a chaplain at Leg|horn; and as the harbour is never without Engli&s;h, Dutch, or Dani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, the Prote&s;tants have always an opportunity of baptizing their children, receiving the &s;acrament, and performing the other rites of their church.</P>
<P>On the quay, near the gallies, is a famous marble of the Grand Duke <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. with four Turki&s;h
<PB N="124" REF="128">
&s;laves, in bronze, chained to the pede&s;tal. It is &s;aid the&s;e &s;laves were a father and his three &s;ons; who at|tempted to run away with one of the Duke's gallies, but were overtaken and put to death.</P>
<P>The ramparts afford a very agreeable pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, and of many country &s;eats on the land-&s;ide. The city is al&s;o well fortified, having two forts to|wards the &s;ea, be&s;ides a citadel. The number of guns, in its &s;everal fortifications, are, at pre&s;ent, about three hundred, mo&s;t of them bra&s;s; and the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix hundred men.</P>
<P>On the left &s;ide of the harbour is a lazaretto; in&s;u|lated, on every &s;ide, and &s;urrounded by wide ditches of running water. Here curio&s;ity, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> led me into an accident, which might have been attended with bad con&s;equences. The general communication, with all places of the Levant, often brings hither ve&s;|&s;els actually infected, or &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o. The crews, when only &s;u&s;pected, are confined within the outward clo&s;e of the lazaretto; the inward area, or clo&s;e, is for tho&s;e actually infected; of all which circum&s;tances I was unacquainted when I went to vi|&s;it the lazaretto; which I did not reach without a great deal of trouble, through a labyrinth of ditches and fortifications. In the fir&s;t clo&s;e I met with people, &s;ome of whom bowed, and drew back, making &s;igns

to me, at the &s;ame time, not to come near them. I entered the clo&s;e-yard of the inner clo&s;e, without meeting with any repul&s;e; the wicket, which is al|mo&s;t always guarded, not happening to be &s;o then. As I was going up to the &s;econd wicket, I &s;aw a cen|tinel &s;tanding there, who called out to me to keep off; and, on &s;eeing me &s;till advancing, fell a &s;kipping, and making ge&s;ticulations like an ideot, or one out of his &s;en&s;es. On my offering him a <HI>buona mancia,</HI> his ge&s;|ticulations, were &s;till more extravagant than before; &s;o that, imagining he was really out of his mind, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to retire; and, being that evening at an a&s;&s;embly, in one of the principal fami|les at Leghorn, I related my di&s;appointment. The whole company &s;huddered at the relation; and I was given to under&s;tand, that if my clothes had in the lea&s;t touched the wicket, or tho&s;e of the centinel, I mu&s;t have been put in one of the cells, of the inner ward, and performed quarantine, along with the infected, of which it was the receptacle; and that had I broke loo&s;e from the centinel, and attempted to run away, his orders were to have fired at me, and to have hit me where he could. This is remarked by way of in|formation again&s;t precipitate curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Leghorn has, accidentally, done, what the greate&s;t reach of politics would have found difficult to have brought about; for it has almo&s;t depopulated Pi&s;a, if
<PB N="126" REF="131">
we compare it to what it was formerly; and it every day le&s;&s;ens the number of inhabitants, even of Florence. It is true &s;trangers pay little, or no taxes directly at Leghorn; but, out of every thing they buy, there goes a large gabel to goverment. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> &s;ays, when he was there, that the very ice-merchant paid above one thou&s;and pounds a year for his privilege, and the tobacco merchant ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This city is, in reality, the chief port on the Medi|terranean; and many of the inhabitants &s;peak Engli&s;h tolerably well. About noon the merchants meet, in a &s;treet adjoining to the &s;quare, to negociate their re|&s;pective concerns; at which time many people, of all nations, are to be &s;een there, as on the Royal Ex|change at London.</P>
<P>All degrees of people live here, not only well, but &s;plendidly; well, notwith&s;tanding the exactions of the Grand Duke; for none can buy lands, or hou&s;es here, but he mu&s;t pay eight per cent of their value to the Duke; none can hire, or build a hou&s;e, without paying the tenth penny; none can marry, or even commence a &s;uit in law, without giving a fee to the Duke; and none can bring &s;o much as an egg, or &s;allad to market, but the Grand Duke has &s;ome &s;hare in it.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132">Barks go daily from Leghorn to Pi&s;a, by a canal &s;ixteen miles long. This canal, be&s;ides the great con|venience it is of to trade, &s;erves as a drain to &s;everal mora&s;&s;es; in winter, indeed, it is &s;ometimes frozen. The pa&s;&s;age is only &s;ix &s;ous; but what makes it di&s;|agreeable is that the company is not always of the be&s;t &s;ort. The ve&s;&s;el is drawn along by men, and takes up &s;ix hours in the pa&s;&s;age. The way, by land, is along a continued plain, over &s;everal &s;tone bridges, acro&s;s the canal; which both fertilizes the &s;oil, and communicates a &s;alubrity to the air, by draining the mora&s;&s;es; however, Leghorn is, by no means, to be ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t healthy cities.</P>
<P>Pi&s;a, divided, like Florence, by the Arno, over which it has three bridges, is &s;ituated in a fine open country. A magnificent broad quay, on each &s;ide the river, the cathedral, bapti&s;tery, leaning tower, con|vents, churches, &amp;c. give it an air of grandeur, in defiance of poverty, and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>Though it is a large city, it has only fifteen thou|&s;and inhabitants; and no commerce or manufactories. It is intere&s;ting, however, to a &s;tranger, on account of the many learned men, and the good &s;ociety he will there find. The markets are well &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions and fruit, at a rea&s;onable rate; and hou&s;e rent is extremely cheap. It is to be preferred, for a win|ter
<PB N="228" REF="133">
re&s;idence, to mo&s;t cities in Italy, for the mildne&s;s of its air; but almo&s;t de&s;erted in &s;ummer, owing to the con&s;tant &s;tagnation of vapours.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome remarkable buildings in Pi&s;a; as the Duomo; the architect of which was <HI>Bu&s;chetto,</HI> a Greek; who began it, according to &s;ome accounts, in 1016; according to others, in 1063. It has many fine columns of porphyry, granite, ja&s;per, verd an|tique. &amp;c. taken from ancient buildings. The bronze gates are extremely curious.</P>
<P>The <HI>companile,</HI> or leaning tower, was fini&s;hed in 1174. It is about one hundred and fifty feet high; and near fifteen feet out of the perpendicular.</P>
<P>The bapti&s;tery is &s;aid to have been built 600 years. It is a large circular building, with a high cupola; all of white marble. Its echo is a&s;toni&s;hing; and, in du|ration, &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the Simonetti &s;eat, near Milan; but the &s;ound of the repercu&s;&s;ions is not &s;o clear.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity has an ob&s;ervatory, furni&s;hed with good Engli&s;h in&s;truments; a botanic garden, once very famous, but now much neglected; and a &s;mall mu&s;aeum, which is modern; and con&s;i&s;ts of birds, fi&s;hes, &s;hells, corals, and fo&s;&s;ils.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="134">The hot-baths are four miles out of the town; they are hand&s;ome, commodious, and the price of lodgings, and living, is regulated, at a moderate rate, by go|vernment.</P>
<P>This city was formerly a celebrated republic; who&s;e formidable fleets often &s;ignalized them&s;elves, again&s;t the Saracens, in the Levant, on the coa&s;t of Africa, and again&s;t the Genoe&s;e; but, falling under the power of the Florentines, after the declen&s;ion of their commerce, by the opening of Leghorn harbour, &s;carce the &s;hadow of its former grandeur now remains. The number of inhabitants, in the eleventh century, were one hundred and fifty thou&s;and. The chief cau&s;e, of the declen&s;ion of this city, was the lo&s;s of the immunities it enjoyed when a republic. Some bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> is &s;till carried on in it, on account of its being the place where the gallies are built, and the re&s;idence of the knights of the order of St. <HI>Stephen;</HI> who have a palace, and church, of their own, oppo&s;ite a very fine &s;quare, wherein &s;tands a magni|ficent marble &s;tatue of <HI>Co&s;mo</HI> I. The exchange is a &s;tately building, but little bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;acted in it.</P>
<P>Pi&s;a is remarkable for the impri&s;onment and death of Count <HI>Ugolino.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">In the civil wars, between the Gwelfs and Gibbe|lins, that de&s;olated all Italy, in the fourteenth century, there was &s;carce an eccle&s;ia&s;tic that did not take a de|cided part. The Gwelfs were for the Pope; the Gib|belins for the Emperor of Germany. Count <HI>Ugolino,</HI> who was a violent partizan, was, through the arti|fices of the archbi&s;hop of Pi&s;a, thrown into pri&s;on, with his two &s;ons, and there &s;tarved to death; the archbi&s;hop having thrown the keys into the river, and fled from the city, The puni&s;hment of the high prie&s;t is recorded by <HI>Dante,</HI> in his Canto of Hell. <HI>See the Plate.</HI></P>
<P>Between the cathedral and the bapti&s;tery is the fa|mous burying-ground, called <HI>campo &s;anto;</HI> from its being covered with earth brought from Jeru&s;alem. It is an oblong &s;quare, &s;urrounded by a very high wall, and always kept &s;hut. Within is a &s;pacious corridore, round the &s;pace, which is a noble walk for a contemplative philo&s;opher. The walls are painted in fre&s;co, by &s;ome eminent painters, with &s;ub|jects taken from the bible. Here are &s;ome deceptions, in per&s;pective, equally ingenious and plea&s;ing; parti|cularly the figures of certain animals, which exhibit the &s;ame appearance, from whatever different points of view they are &s;een. One divi&s;ion of the burying-ground con&s;i&s;ts of a particular compo&s;t; which, in nine days, con&s;umes the dead bodies to the bones; in

all probability, it is no other than common earth, mixed with quick-lime. At one corner of the cor|ridore there are pictures of three bodies, repre&s;ented in the three different &s;tages of putrefaction, which they undergo when laid in this compo&s;ition. At the end of the fir&s;t three days, the body is bloated and &s;welled, and the features are enlarged and di&s;torted to &s;uch a degree, as fills the &s;pectator with horror. At the &s;ixth day, the &s;welling is &s;ub&s;ided, and all the mu&s;cular fle&s;h hangs loo&s;ened from the bones: at the ninth, nothing but the &s;keleton remains.</P>
<P>Sienna, a pretty large city, lies upon three hills, which render the &s;treets very uneven; but this is com|pen&s;ated by the beauty of the pro&s;pects, and the great &s;alubrity of the air. It is about five miles in circuit&punc; the population amounts to about &s;ixteen, or &s;eventeen thou&s;and inhabitants. It is thought that at Sienna, the Italian language is &s;poken in its greate&s;t purity, and perfection; on which account many foreigners re&s;ide in it, till they have learnt the language.</P>
<P>Sienna, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> in the mid&s;t of hills, of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;hapes, excellently cultivated, is, per|haps, the mo&s;t de&s;irable place in Italy, for a &s;tranger to pa&s;s &s;ome time in; the climate being moderate, living rea&s;onable, &s;ociety good, and the language &s;poken in the greate&s;t purity. It is al&s;o within a mo|derate
<PB N="132" REF="138">
di&s;tance, both of Rome and Florence; the hou&s;es are built with brick, and the &s;treets are paved with it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Piccolimini,</HI> and <HI>Zondadari</HI> palaces are by much the be&s;t, all the others being but meanly built; al|though the many towers erected on private hou&s;es, on account of the feuds between the Gwelfs and Gib|belins, give the town a grand appearance at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sienna is particularly agreeable in the hot months, on account of its lofty &s;ituation, and fine air. It has produced many famous painters, architects, and poets; the nobility are as di&s;tingui&s;hed as any in Italy, and have a ca&s;&s;ino, or a&s;&s;embly of both &s;exes. The wo|men, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> are beautiful; and have more free|dom than in many other parts of Italy. The magi&s;|tracy con&s;i&s;ts of a governor, and &s;enate of nine per|&s;ons called <HI>Excel&s;i,</HI> who&s;e pre&s;ident is &s;tiled <HI>Capitaneo de populo.</HI> They flatter them&s;elves with retaining a kind of liberty in their election; but this is only an external &s;how; for the &s;enate can take no mea&s;ure, of any con&s;equence, without permi&s;&s;ion of the Grand Duke.</P>
<P>Of its curio&s;ities, there is nothing in this city &s;o extraordinary, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> as the cathedral; which a man may view with plea&s;ure, after he has &s;een St. <HI>Pe|ter</HI>'s

at Rome; though it is quite of another make, and can only be looked upon as one of the ma&s;ter|pieces of Gothic architecture. The materials are rich, the workman&s;hip mo&s;t elaborate, and the orna|ments exqui&s;itely nice, in the Gothic way. The very &s;pouts are loaded with ornaments; the windows are formed like &s;o many &s;cenes of per&s;pective, with a mul|titude of little pillars, retiring one behind another; the great columns are finely engraven with fruits and foliage, from the very top to the bottom; and the whole body of the church is chequered with different lays of white and black marble; the pavement curi|ou&s;ly cut out in de&s;igns and &s;cripture-&s;tories; and the front covered with &s;uch a variety of figures, and over-run with &s;o many little mazes and labyrinths of &s;culpture, that nothing in the world can make a pret|tier &s;hew, to tho&s;e who prefer fal&s;e beauties, and af|fected ornaments, to a noble and maje&s;tic &s;implicity. In this church are the bu&s;ts of one hundred and &s;e|venty popes, in plai&s;ter of Paris. Six who were na|tives of this city; and the twelve apo&s;tles are honoured with marble &s;tatues.</P>
<P>Near the cathedral is the archbi&s;hop's palace; and oppo&s;ite to it a large, and well-endowed ho&s;pital, founded by a &s;hoemaker. There is a figure of him, &s;uper&s;cribed <HI>&s;utor ultra crepidam,</HI> "The &s;hoemaker beyond his la&s;t." The univer&s;ity, which was founded
<PB N="134" REF="140">
by <HI>Charles</HI> V. is in a declining condition. The Ger|man &s;tudents enjoy particular privileges, granted to them by the &s;ame emperor.</P>
<P>The Franci&s;can church here abounds in fine paint|ing. In the convent-garden is an ever-green oak, &s;aid to have &s;prung from St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s &s;taff, which was here &s;tuck in the ground. <HI>Spon,</HI> in his travels through Greece, mentions a large wild cherry-tree near the old ca&s;tle at Smyrna, which is believed, by &s;uch of the inhabitants as are of the Greek church, to have been in&s;tantaneou&s;ly produced from the &s;taff of S. <HI>Polycarp.</HI> In like manner <HI>Hercules'</HI> club, which was an olive-tree, is &s;aid, by the ancients, to have taken root, and be|come a flouri&s;hing tree.</P>
<P>The territory of Sienna, and that part of Tu&s;cany, between Sienna and Florence, pre&s;ent the traveller, coming from Rome, with a new heaven, and a new earth. The towns, the villages, and the farms, be&s;ides their number, are better peopled than in the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;tate; the lands are better cultivated, the men more robu&s;t, and, in their whole carriage, &s;hew that chearfulne&s;s, alacrity and vigour, which accompany ca&s;e and plenty, and are not damped and extingui&s;hed by di&s;tre&s;s. In the very pea&s;ants are to be &s;een tho&s;e &s;ignificant phy&s;iognomies, which completely an|&s;wer the pictures of <HI>Dante, Boccace, Machiavel,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="135" REF="141">
To this improvement, and extent of cultivation, is certainly to be attributed the &s;erenity of the &s;ky, which is not clogged here with the fuliginous vapours, exhaled from the wa&s;tes of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate.</P>

<P>THAT &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which has long made the Tu&s;cans enamoured with poetry, &s;ays <HI>Ba|retti,</HI> has totally worn out the ferocity, for which they were &s;o remarkable, in the brutal times of the Guelfs and Gibbelines; and has brought them to be, perhaps, the mo&s;t gentle and amiable nation now extant. Tho&s;e times may well be called brutal, when we recollect what is recorded in the hi&s;tory of Pi&s;a, of Count <HI>Ugo|lino</HI> and his two &s;ons. This character of gentlene&s;s is, indeed, ea&s;ily to be perceived by any traveller, as &s;oon as he reaches the highe&s;t tops of the Appennines, where all &s;trangers are treated with the &s;ofte&s;t urbanity
<PB N="136" REF="142">
by tho&s;e mountaineers; who, to the &s;implicity natu|ral to all inhabitants of exten&s;ive ridges of hills, join the mo&s;t obliging expre&s;&s;ions, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manners. And a traveller mu&s;t be very peevi&s;h, and ill-humoured, who is not &s;atisfied with the ru&s;tic be|nevolence of the Tu&s;cans, as he goes de&s;cending to|wards Florence; where even the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers treat him with the greate&s;t civility; a&s;king the u&s;ual que&s;tions with their hats off, vi&s;iting his baggage with|out throwing every thing top&s;y-turvy, and mode&s;tly thanking him for any &s;mall coin, &s;lipped into their hands, as a reward for their di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The people here, &s;ays <HI>Howell,</HI> &s;eem, in general, to be more courteous, and of a higher comportment, than el&s;ewhere. They are allowed to be inimitable in making repartees, or telling &s;tories with a good grace.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are tall and well-made; the women re|markably hand&s;ome and very fair; they are extremely clean and well-dre&s;&s;ed; and, on Sundays and holi|days, their hair is nicely and becomingly adju&s;ted, and ornamented with a very &s;mall hat, elegantly trim|med, and worn ju&s;t above the left ear; and, on the other &s;ide, a mat of flowers is often interwoven, with &s;trings of pearl; they wear ear-rings of five, or &s;even drops of pearl &s;et in gold, and necklaces compo&s;ed of

&s;everal rows of the &s;ame. When at work, or when they bring their goods to market, their hair is con|fined by a &s;ilk net of crim&s;on, &s;carlet, or blue &s;ilk; and tied by two &s;trings, ornamented with ta&s;&s;els, which are frequently of gold or &s;ilver. They do not wear gowns, but a kind of jacket, without &s;leeves. They have no other covering for the upper part of the arm, but their &s;hift &s;leeves; which are tied with ribband. Their petticoats are generally of a &s;carlet colour, and above one ear they fix their little &s;traw hat; the whole of which dre&s;s gives them a more gay, &s;mart, coqueti&s;h air, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> than any country girls I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The Italians, in general, are the greate&s;t loungers in the world; and, while walking in the fields, or &s;tretched in the &s;hade, &s;eem to enjoy the &s;erenity, and genial warmth of their climate, with a degree of lux|urious indulgence, peculiar to them&s;elves. Without ever running into the daring exce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h, or di&s;playing the fri&s;ky vivacity of the French, or the invincible phlegm of the Germans; they di&s;cover a &s;pecies of &s;edate &s;en&s;ibility to every &s;ource of enjoy|ment; from which, perhaps, they derive a greater de|gree of happine&s;s, than any of the other. The fre|quent proce&s;&s;ions, and religious ceremonies, be&s;ides amu&s;ing and comforting them, &s;erve to fill up their time, and prevent that <HI>ennui,</HI> and tho&s;e immoral prac|tices, which are apt to accompany poverty and idle|ne&s;s.
<PB N="138" REF="144">
It is nece&s;&s;ary, for the quiet and happine&s;s of every community, that the populace be employed. Some politicians imagine that their whole time &s;hould be &s;pent in gainful indu&s;try. Others think, that though the riches of the &s;tate will not be augmented; yet the general happine&s;s, which is a more important object, will be promoted; by blending the occupation of in|du&s;try, with a con&s;iderable proportion of &s;uch &s;uper|&s;titious ceremonies, as awaken the future hopes, with|out lulling the pre&s;ent benevolence of the multitude.</P>
<P>In all the great cities of Italy, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> &s;everal &s;hops are &s;hut up, from twelve, to half after one; or longer, &s;o &s;acred is the ceremony of dining. Even &s;ervants in&s;i&s;t on this privilege, to a degree truly ri|diculous. An Engli&s;h gentleman, not apprized of this cu&s;tom upon his fir&s;t arrival in Italy, po&s;&s;ibly calls for his &s;ervant when the man is ju&s;t &s;et down to dine; but, if he calls twenty times, he receives no other an|&s;wer than that he is at dinner; <HI>(a Tavola &s;ignore)</HI> "At table, Sir;" which every Italian &s;ervant &s;uppo&s;es to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on that his ma&s;ter &s;hould wait, though the bu&s;ine&s;s were ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Society, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> &s;eems to be on an ea&s;y and agreeable footing in Florence. Be&s;ides the <HI>conver|&s;azioni,</HI> which they have here, as in other towns of Italy, a number of the nobility meet every day, at a
<PB N="139" REF="145">
hou&s;e called the <HI>Ca&s;ino.</HI> This &s;ociety is pretty much on the &s;ame footing with the clubs in London. The members are elected by ballot, meet at no particular hour, but go when it is convenient. They play at billiards, cards, and other games, or continue conver&s;|ing the whole evening, as they think proper. They are &s;erved with tea, coffee, lemonade, ices, or what other refre&s;hments they chu&s;e; and each per&s;on pays for what he calls for. There is one material differ|ence between this and the Engli&s;h clubs, viz. that wo|men, as well as men, are admitted members.</P>
<P>The company, of both &s;exes, behave with more frankne&s;s and familiarity to &s;trangers, as well as to each other, than is cu&s;tomary at public a&s;&s;emblies, in other parts of Italy.</P>
<P>The opera of Florence is a place where the people of quality pay, and receive vi&s;its, and conver&s;e as freely as at the <HI>Ca&s;ino.</HI> This occa&s;ions a continual pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing to, and from, the boxes, except in tho&s;e where there is a party of cards formed; it is then looked upon as a piece of ill-manners to di&s;turb the players. I was never more &s;urprized, &s;ays the above writer, than when it was propo&s;ed to me to make one of a whi&s;t party, in a box which &s;eemed to have been made for the purpo&s;e; with a little table in the middle. I hinted that it would be full as conve|nient
<PB N="140" REF="146">
to have the party &s;omewhere el&s;e; but I was told good mu&s;ic added greatly to the plea&s;ure of a whi&s;t party; that it increa&s;ed the joy of good fortune, and &s;oothed the affliction of bad. As I thought the peo|ple of this country better acquainted with the power of mu&s;ic than my&s;elf, I conte&s;ted the point no longer; but generally played two or three rubbers at whi&s;t, in the &s;tage-box, every opera night.</P>
<P>Hence it may be perceived that in this city, as in &s;ome other towns in Italy, little attention is paid to the mu&s;ic, by the company in the boxes; except at &s;ome new opera, or during &s;ome favourite air. But the dancers command a general attention; as &s;oon as they begin, conver&s;ation cea&s;es; even the card-players lay down their cards, and fix their eyes on the ballet. Yet the excellence of Italian dancing con&s;i&s;ts in feats of &s;trength, and a kind of jerking agility, more than in graceful movement. There is a continual conte&s;t among the performers who &s;hall &s;pring highe&s;t. None of the &s;prightly alluring gaiety, of the French comic-dancers, is to be &s;een here; nor of the graceful atti|tudes, and &s;mooth flowing motions, of the performers in the &s;erious opera at Paris,</P>
<P>On the evenings on which there is no opera, it is u&s;ual, for genteel company, to drive to a public walk, immediately without the city, where they remain till
<PB N="141" REF="147">
it begins to grow du&s;ki&s;h; &s;ome riding in coaches, and others walking. It is not cu&s;tomary to &s;ee mar|ried people together in their excur&s;ions; but the hu&s;|band in a coach with another lady, and the wife with another gentleman. When ladies walk, their foot|men go before; and, in their coaches, they are very polite, and often bow fir&s;t, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers. It is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee a large fellow fanning him&s;elf, and fine women riding a&s;tride; as al&s;o to &s;ee a &s;core of boys, coming from &s;chool, with books under their arms, and &s;words by their &s;ides. Per&s;ons of every profe&s;&s;ion, even to the valet, may wear a &s;word; but phy&s;icians are obliged to drive their chariots with a &s;ingle hor&s;e.</P>
<P>At all the hou&s;es of the nobles in Florence, is an empty ca&s;k hanging out, to denote they &s;ell wine by retail; this cu&s;tom &s;hocks an Engli&s;hman, as very de|rogatory to their dignity; and he cannot but &s;peak of it with &s;urprize. A Florentine cooly, and &s;en&s;ibly an|&s;wers, "Sir, your Duke of &mdash;, by the interpo&s;i|tion of his &s;teward, &s;ells a tree for ten &s;hillings; a Florentine Noble, by his porter at the door, &s;ells ten &s;hillings worth of wine; but our Noble appears no more in the &s;ale of his wine, than your Duke in the &s;ale of his tree: different countries have their differ|ent modes." The fact is, that great part of the rent of e&s;tates in Italy is paid in kind; which, joined with
<PB N="142" REF="148">
a certain exemption from the duty on wine, granted to nobles, has led them into this &s;eeming littlene&s;s.</P>
<P>I was at a mo&s;t elegant concert, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> during my &s;tay in Florence, given by the Lucche&s;e envoy. The cu&s;tom, on this occa&s;ion, is, to calculate the number of per&s;ons the room will hold, and to invite accord|ingly; but ladies only are invited. It is computed that cards &s;ent to twenty, or twenty-&s;ix ladies, will bring near four&s;core gentlemen; and the number, at this a&s;&s;embly, an&s;wered to that calculation. The greate&s;t di&s;proportion, between the number of ladies, at the Italian <HI>conver&s;azioni,</HI> and the London routs, is very &s;triking to an Engli&s;hman; but the phenomenon ad|mits of an ea&s;y &s;olution. No &s;ingle ladies vi&s;it in Italy; all, who are &s;een in the world, are married women. If a gentleman here has three &s;ons, and three daughters, two of the daughters are, mo&s;t pro|bably, in a convent, whil&s;t all the three &s;ons, at lea&s;t two of them, have nothing el&s;e to do, than frequent the &s;pectacles, and the <HI>conver&s;azioni.</HI></P>
<P>In Florence, adds <HI>Sharpe,</HI> the generality of ladies have their cici&s;beos; the fir&s;t is the cici&s;beo of dig|nity; the &s;econd is the cici&s;beo who picks up the glove, gives the fan, and pulls off, or puts on, the cloak, &amp;c. the third cici&s;beo is, by the wags, deemed the &s;ub&s;tantial cici&s;beo, or lover.&mdash;But God knows
<PB N="143" REF="149">
how the&s;e matters go, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe;</HI> for, in public, the ladies behave with &s;o much mode&s;ty, and with &s;o much decorum, that one would be tempted to treat &s;ome of the&s;e reports as mere calumny, were not the truth of them &s;o notorious; in fact, the univer&s;ality of the vice has, in a manner, dive&s;ted it of the ap|pearance of vice. In England a woman, who is pub|licly criminal, u&s;ually becomes profligate and aban|doned; here almo&s;t every woman, of however virtu|ous a di&s;po&s;ition, falls into the general cu&s;tom, and is equally criminal, with the woman of loo&s;e principles; &s;o that the di&s;tinction of good and bad, that is, of cha&s;te and di&s;&s;olute, is hardly known in Italy, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe;</HI> in a word, tis the mode, the <HI>etiquette,</HI> the <HI>bon ton</HI> of the fine people.</P>
<P><HI>Baretti</HI> is extremely enraged with the above writer, for the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms thrown out again&s;t his countrywo|men; <HI>Moore</HI> likewi&s;e endeavoured to palliate this &s;ingular cu&s;tom, of the Italian ladies having cici&s;beos to attend them every where, by ob&s;erving that the Italians, finding that the confinement of their wives, which was a plan they formerly adopted, was univer|&s;ally reprobated, and that any appearance of jealou&s;y likewi&s;e &s;ubjected them to ridicule; agreed that their wives &s;hould go with company, and attend public places; but always e&s;corted by a friend whom they could tru&s;t; and who, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould not be
<PB N="144" REF="150">
di&s;agreeable to the wife. This compromi&s;e could not fail of being acceptable to the women, who plainly perceived they mu&s;t be gainers by any alteration of the former &s;y&s;tem; and it &s;oon became univer&s;al all ovet Italy, for a woman to appear at public places, leaning on the arms of a man; who, from their fre|quent whi&s;pering together, was called her cici&s;beo. It was &s;tipulated at the &s;ame time, that the lady, while abroad under his care, &s;hould conver&s;e with no other man, but in his pre&s;ence, and with his approbation; he was to be her guardian, her friend, and her gentle|man-u&s;her.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom at pre&s;ent is, that this ob&s;equious gen|tleman vi&s;its the lady, every forenoon, at her toilet, where the plan for pa&s;&s;ing the evening is agreed upon; he di&s;appears before dinner, for it is u&s;ual, all over Italy, for the hu&s;band and wife to dine <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> ex|cept on great occa&s;ions; as when there is a public fea&s;t. After dinner the hu&s;band retires, and the cici&s;beo re|turns, and conducts the lady to the public walk, the <HI>conver&s;azioni,</HI> or the opera; he hands her about where|ever &s;he goes, pre&s;ents her coffee, &s;orts her cards, and attends, with the mo&s;t pointed a&s;&s;iduity, till the amu&s;e|ments of the evening are over; he accompanies her home, and delivers up his charge to the hu&s;band, who is then &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ume his functions.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151">From the nature of this connection, it could not be an ea&s;y matter to find a cici&s;beo, who would be equally agreeable to the hu&s;band and wife. At the beginning of the in&s;titution, the hu&s;bands, it is &s;aid, preferred the platonic &s;wains, who profe&s;&s;ed only the metaphy&s;ics of love; and who&s;e lectures, they ima|gined, might refine their wives ideas, and bring them to the &s;ame way of thinking; in many in&s;tances, no doubt, it would happen that the platonic admirer acted with le&s;s &s;eraphic ends; but the&s;e in&s;tances &s;erve only as proofs that the hu&s;bands were mi&s;taken in their men; for however ab&s;urd it may appear, in the eyes of &s;ome people, to imagine that the hu&s;bands believe it is only a platonic connection, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between their wives and the cici&s;beos; it is &s;till more ab&s;urd to believe, as &s;ome &s;trangers who have pa&s;&s;ed through this country &s;eem to have done, that this whole &s;y&s;tem of cici&s;bei&s;m was from the beginning, and is now, an univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of adultery, connived at by every Ita|lian hu&s;band. To get clear of one difficulty, tho&s;e gentlemen fall into another, much more inexplicable; by &s;uppo&s;ing that the men, who, of all the inhabitants of Europe, were the mo&s;t &s;crupulous, with regard to their wives cha&s;tity, &s;hould acquie&s;ce in, and, in a manner, become &s;ub&s;ervient to, their pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>The cici&s;beo, in many in&s;tances, is a poor relation, or a humble friend; who, not being in circum&s;tances
<PB N="146" REF="152">
to &s;upport an equipage, is happy to be admitted into all the &s;ocieties; and to be carried about to public di|ver&s;ions, as an appendage to the lady. There are numbers of the&s;e gentlemen who&s;e appearance, and bodily infirmities, carried the cleare&s;t refutation, with re&s;pect to them&s;elves per&s;onally, of the &s;candalous &s;tories of an improper connection between them and their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. The humble and timid air, which many of them betray in the pre&s;ence of the ladies, and the per&s;everance with which they continue their &s;er|vices, notwith&s;tanding the contemptuous &s;tile in which they are often treated, is equally unlike the haughti|ne&s;s natural to favoured lovers, and the indifference of men &s;atiated with enjoyment.</P>
<P>There are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, cici&s;beos of a very different &s;tamp; who&s;e figure and manners might be &s;uppo&s;ed more agreeable to the ladies they &s;erve, than to their lords. I once expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> that a particular per&s;on permitted one of this de&s;cription to attend his wife. I was told, by way of &s;olution of my difficulty, that the hu&s;band was poor, and the cici&s;beo rich. It is not in Italy alone where infamous connections of this kind take place.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o known in&s;tances where the characters of the ladies were &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, as not to be &s;haken, either in the opinion of their acquaintances, or hu&s;|bands;
<PB N="147" REF="153">
although their gallants were, in every re&s;pect, agreeable and accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But, whether the connection be &s;uppo&s;ed innocent, or criminal, mo&s;t Engli&s;hmen will be a&s;toni&s;hed how men can pa&s;s &s;o much of their time with women. This will appear le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, when they recollect that the Italian nobility dare not intermeddle with po|litics, can find no employment in the army or navy; and that there are no &s;uch amu&s;ements as hunting or drinking. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, if a man of fortune has no turn to gaming, what mu&s;t he do? Even an Engli&s;hman, in the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, might be driven to the company and conver&s;ation of women, to lighten the burden of time. The Italians have per&s;evered &s;o long in this expedient, that however ex|traordinary it may &s;eem, to tho&s;e who never tried it, there can be no doubt but they find it to &s;ucceed. They a&s;&s;ert that nothing &s;o effectually &s;oothes the cares, and beguiles the tediou&s;ne&s;s of life, as the com|pany of an agreeable woman; that, though the inti|macy &s;hould never exceed the limits of friend&s;hip, there is &s;omething more flattering, and more agreeable in it, than in male friend&s;hip; that they find the fe|male heart more &s;incere, le&s;s intere&s;ted, and warmer in its attachments; and that women, in general, have more delicacy than men. But it may be replied, that a man can enjoy all the&s;e advantages, to as great
<PB N="148" REF="154">
perfection, by an intimacy and friend&s;hip with his own wife, as with his neighbour's? <HI>"Non Mon&s;ieur, point,"</HI> No, Sir, by no means, an&s;wered a Frenchman, to whom this que&s;tion was once addre&s;&s;ed. <HI>"Et pour|quoi done? Parceque cela n'e&s;t pas permis."</HI> And why not&mdash;becau&s;e it is not the fa&s;hion? This does not &s;eem a very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, to &s;o pertinent a que&s;tion; it is, however, the only an&s;wer to be ob|tained all over Italy.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem is, however, unknown to the middle, and lower ranks; they pa&s;s their time in the exerci&s;e of their profe&s;&s;ions, and in the &s;ociety of their wives and children, as in other countries; and, in that &s;phere of life, jealou&s;y, which formed &s;o &s;trong a feature in the Italian character, is &s;till to be found as &s;trong as ever. He who attempts to vi&s;it the wife, or mi&s;tre&s;s of any of the trades-people, without their permi&s;&s;ion, is in no &s;mall danger of a <HI>coltellata.</HI> Is has often been a&s;&s;erted, that Italian women have remarkable powers of attracting their lovers. Tho&s;e powers, whatever they are, do not &s;eem to depend entirely on per&s;onal charms; as many of them retain their influence after their beauty is much in the vane: and they them&s;elves con&s;iderably advanced in years. I know, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> an Italian nobleman, of great fortune, who has been lately married to a very beautiful young woman, and
<PB N="149" REF="155">
yet continues his a&s;&s;iduity to his former mi&s;tre&s;s, now an old woman, as punctual as ever.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;atisfaction the Italians find in this kind of con&s;tancy, and in their friendly attachments to one woman; my friend, the marquis de <HI>F</HI>&mdash;, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> told me, when I &s;aw him at Paris, that he had tried it while he remained at Rome, and found it quite in|tolerable. A certain obliging eccle&s;ia&s;tic had taken the trouble, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of a lady of that city, to arrange matters between her and the marquis, who was put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the rights that were ever &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to a cici&s;beo. The woman dete&s;ted her hu&s;band, which had advanced mat|ters con&s;iderably; and her pa&s;&s;ion for the marquis was in proportion to her abhorrence of the other. In this &s;tate things had remained but a very &s;hort time, when the marquis called, one afternoon, to drive the Abb&eacute; out a little way into the country; but he hap|pened to have ju&s;t dined. The meals of this eccle&s;i|a&s;tic were generally oppre&s;&s;ive, for two or three hours after they were fini&s;hed; he therefore declined the in|vitation, &s;aying, by way of apology, <HI>Je &s;uis dans les horreurs de la dige&s;tion.</HI> "I am in all the horrors of dige&s;tion." He then enquired how the marquis's amour went on with the lady. <HI>Ah pour l'amour cela e&s;t a peu pr&egrave;s pa&s;&s;&eacute;,</HI> replied the marquis, <HI>&amp; nous &s;ommes actuellement dans les horreurs de l'amiti&ecirc;.</HI> "Oh! as for
<PB N="150" REF="156">
love, that is pa&s;t, &s;ays the marquis, and we are now in all the horrors of friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>The lower people in Italy, who have bread enough, &s;pend more than would ea&s;ily be credited in wine; though neither their abilities, nor the example of their betters, lead them into drunkenne&s;s. They have a notion that it is whole&s;ome, and therefore give it to their children at the brea&s;t. Some of the Florentine nobles allow their men-&s;ervants &s;even or eight &s;hillings a month, for this article only, rather than furni&s;h them with it, which they always &s;pend.</P>
<P>As to their table, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> I have often heard people, with a &s;neer, extol the Florentine &s;uppers; which, &s;ay they, con&s;i&s;t of a few &s;allad leaves, ga|thered by the gue&s;ts them&s;elves, from pots &s;tanding at the window, and garni&s;hed with a little wild endive. I have, however, dined at &s;ome hou&s;es in Florence; where, be&s;ides plenty and goodne&s;s, every thing was &s;erved up extremely neat; the wine excellent; and, what improved the reli&s;h of the whole, was that fe&s;ti|vity inherent in the Florentines. I mu&s;t further add, that, in the whole cour&s;e of my travels, I never found an inn, where we fared &s;o well, were &s;o well attended, and the bills &s;o rea&s;onable, as at Florence; an evi|dent proof of the plenty, and &s;uper-abundance of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="157">The palaces of the nobles in Florence are very large; indeed they are of &s;uch extent that, u&s;ually, only one floor is occupied at the &s;ame time. During winter they inhabit the upper apartments; and, in &s;ummer, re&s;ide entirely on the ground-floor; a mo&s;t agreeable piece of luxury in the northern parts of Italy, which are of &s;uch oppo&s;ite degrees of heat and cold, in the two &s;ea&s;ons.

<P>ON every twenty-fourth of June they have a hor&s;e, and chariot race in this city, in imitation of the ancients; and as a fe&s;tivity in honour of St. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, the tutelar &s;aint of Florence. It is exhibited in the great &s;quare, which is &s;urrounded by guards to keep off the mob. The hor&s;es &s;tart without riders; and run full two miles, through the &s;treets, from the gate called <HI>del prato,</HI> to that called <HI>&s;anta croce.</HI> The &s;treets are covered with &s;and on this occa&s;ion; and the hor&s;es have a round machine, &s;omething like a ball, hanging down their &s;ides by &s;trings, with &s;mall iron pricks in it, as &s;harp as the point of a lancet; &s;o that the fa&s;ter they run, the more they &s;pur them&s;elves. They &s;tart for a piece of velvet, of about thirty pounds value, and run with incredible &s;peed. Before the&s;e races begin, the principal nobility and gentry parade the &s;treets in their fine&s;t equipages. Their coaches are prodigiou&s;ly grand, finely carved, and
<PB N="154" REF="160">
richly gilt, with gla&s;s all around them. They go down on one &s;ide of the &s;treet, and up the other, for two hours; meeting and &s;aluting one another. The ladies make a mo&s;t brilliant, and charming appear|ance, as they are generally beautiful, and richly dre&s;&s;ed. When the hor&s;es are ready to &s;tart, notice is given, by &s;ound of trumpet, for the coaches to quit the &s;treet. Then the quality go into hou&s;es, mo&s;t of which have balconies covered with tape&s;try, &s;ome with fine dama&s;k, and others with velvet; which renders the &s;treet, from one end to the other, extremely plea|&s;ant and gay.</P>
<P>The carnival is al&s;o a time of great diver&s;ion among the Florentines, who are then generally ma&s;ked; and a&s;|&s;emble, in the afternoon, in the &s;quare of <HI>&s;anta croce,</HI> which is railed in, &s;ometimes, to the number of ten thou|&s;and ma&s;ks, and upwards, richly dre&s;&s;ed, in all kinds of characters; but no prie&s;t dares to be pre&s;ent, at the&s;e di|ver&s;ions, in ma&s;k, for fear of the inqui&s;ition. While the&s;e diver&s;ions pa&s;s within the rails, others are going forward on the out&s;ide, either in coaches or cars; &s;ome of which are full of mu&s;icians, who &s;it on benches, as in our orche&s;tra, dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t whim&s;ical grote&s;que manner; and play a variety of tunes, on different in&s;truments. The drivers, and even their hor&s;es, are all in ma&s;querade; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the gaiety of this carnival, which continues about
<PB N="155" REF="161">
three weeks, or a month; but Sundays are the greate&s;t days for the&s;e diver&s;ions, which end when Lent begins.</P>
<P>Corpus Chri&s;ti day is al&s;o a grand fe&s;tival at Flo|rence; when the clergy go, in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, to the cathedral. The different orders of monks are then dre&s;&s;ed in long &s;a&s;hes, and each per&s;on carries a lighted torch in his hand, through the &s;treets, which are &s;trewed with flowers, and leaves of ever-green. Above one thou&s;and of them walk two and two, in this proce&s;&s;ion, according to their &s;eniority; &s;ome of whom have &s;ilver candle&s;ticks, near five feet high, with large wax candles, lighted, carrying before them. The prie&s;ts follow next, in great numbers; then the clergy belonging to the cathedral; after the&s;e come the canons, who are chiefly of the nobility, &s;ome with purple and &s;carlet cloaks; others with fine pieces of camel &s;kins hanging loo&s;e on their &s;houlders. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by the dignified clergy; after whom follows the archbi&s;hop of Florence, under a magni|ficent canopy, with the ho&s;t in his hand, attended by the nobility and gentry, all bare headed, and each car|rying a lighted flambeau, with their &s;ervants by their &s;ide. The&s;e are followed by the guards, bare-headed, and they are &s;ucceeded by the magi&s;trates in their robes. This proce&s;&s;ion begins about &s;ix in the morn|ing, and continues pa&s;&s;ing by till noon, through &s;everal
<PB N="156" REF="162">
&s;treets, covered on the tops with canvas, to make an agreeable &s;hade.</P>
<P>It is but little more than three centuries &s;ince that part of Italy, which lies between the Tyrrhene &s;ea and the highe&s;t mountains of the Apennines, was divided into eight or nine &s;mall republican &s;tates; each &s;o jea|lous of the re&s;t, that they were continually making war upon each other, with as much fury as the paucity of their troops would admit.</P>
<P>Their di&s;&s;entions proved fatal to their liberty; be|ing all reduced under the the dominion of the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, except the little territory of Lucca. The Tu&s;cans, in that divided and republican &s;tate, were a mo&s;t ferocious and brutal people; but having lo&s;t that, which, in the common language of politicians, has long been honoured with the name of liberty, thought, as they enjoyed it by no means de&s;erving of that re&s;pectable appellation, the inclinations and man|ners of the Tu&s;cans underwent a happy change. Arts and literature were the only occupations in which, under their new form of government, they could find full employment for their bu&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s minds. They turned to them on a &s;udden; and with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that &s;oon forced mankind to look upon them, as the only people in Europe, fit to be their teacher.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="163">On &s;eeing literature and arts thus happily revived in Tu&s;cany, &s;everal of the greate&s;t, among the &s;ove|reigns of Europe, became &s;en&s;ible of their efficacy towards poli&s;hing the human &s;pecies; and were de&s;i|rous of having them introduced into their re&s;pective dominions.</P>
<P>To obtain this laudable end, &s;everal of the French monarchs invited many of the mo&s;t celebrated arti&s;ts, and men of letters from Florence, and other parts of Tu&s;cany, and encouraged them with &s;uch liberality, that in a little time they were able to produce a very remarkable change, in the manners of that nation; till then addicted to, almo&s;t, nothing but barbarous gallantry, and the de&s;tructive art of war. Thus Tu&s;|cany was the mi&s;tre&s;s of politene&s;s to France; and this little province may ju&s;tly boa&s;t of having produced, and nearly at one time, a greater number of extra|ordinary men, than any, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> of the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive European dominions.</P>
<P>The good effects produced in Tu&s;cany, by the cul|tivation of arts and literature, continue to this time. It is true the Tu&s;cans are inferior to their forefathers, in many re&s;pects, and particularly in the polite arts; but where is the modern nation who&s;e arti&s;ts can claim any equality with <HI>Michael Angelo, C. Lionardo, Donatello, Cellini,</HI> and other ingenious men of that
<PB N="158" REF="164">
age? Yet the Tu&s;cans are &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as much &s;kill and ta&s;te, in tho&s;e arts, as any other modern nations; as the accounts given, by almo&s;t all tra|vellers, of the elegance of their buildings, furni|ture, and general mode of living atte&s;t; add to this, the many Tu&s;can arti&s;ts to be met with, in the differ|ent capitals on the continent, and particularly in Lon|don. As to their academical accompli&s;hments, tho&s;e who have taken the trouble to read the writings of <HI>Gori, Cocchi, Lami, Perelli,</HI> and other modern Tu&s;can writers, mu&s;t allow that Florence is intitled to as much literary fame, as any town in Europe, of equal di|men&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among the general characteri&s;tics of the Floren|tines is their love of poetry, and their cu&s;tom of <HI>im|provi&s;are,</HI> or &s;inging ver&s;e <HI>ex tempore,</HI> to the guitar, or any other mu&s;ical in&s;truments.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e qualities in them are of very ancient date. The Tu&s;cans were &s;mitten by the charms of poetry, to a greater degree than any other people, as &s;oon as their language began to be turned towards ver&s;e. One of our novelli&s;ts, remarks the above writer, &s;ays that the common people of Florence u&s;ed to &s;ing the poem of <HI>Dante,</HI> about the &s;treets, during the life of that poet; whom we ju&s;tly con&s;ider as our fir&s;t poetic writer. It appears, be&s;ides, that the ancient
<PB N="159" REF="165">
odes, &s;ongs, &amp;c. collected by <HI>La&s;ca,</HI> were chiefly com|po&s;ed by people of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s in Tu&s;cany; &s;uch as &s;hoemakers, carpenters, coblers, barbers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of their literature, we &s;hall give a &s;triking anecdote of their ignorance and &s;uper|&s;tition; extracted from <HI>Sharpe,</HI> who avers it to be fact. Madame <HI>Minorbetti,</HI> a woman of di&s;tinction at Flo|rence, gave occa&s;ion, from her name, &s;ays this writer, to one of the mo&s;t ridiculous events that ever fell within my knowledge; and which would put to the blu&s;h &s;ome of the curious Greek etymologies we are enter|tained with in the po&s;thumous works of Dean <HI>Swift.</HI> He a&s;&s;erts, for the honour of Great Britain, that many of tho&s;e names, which we call Greek, are derived from the Engli&s;h language; and, by corruption, have at|tained the ca&s;t of the Greek language. For example, he &s;ays, "<HI>Andromache</HI> is a corruption of the Scotch name <HI>Andrew Mackay; Archimedes</HI> of Hark ye maids," &amp;c. &amp;c. It &s;eems a relation of Madame <HI>Minorbetti,</HI> in the agonies of death, was de&s;irous to have a famous relic in Florence, no le&s;s than an arm of our Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Becket,</HI> brought to his bed-&s;ide; from a per|&s;ua&s;ion he &s;hould be re&s;tored to health, by its mira|culous influence. The monk, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the arm is, rejected the petition; and pleaded the impo&s;|&s;ibility of carrying it beyond the precincts of the con|vent; the relations, on the other hand, urged that
<PB N="160" REF="166">
they were de&s;cended from the family of the <HI>Beckets,</HI> and, therefore that &s;uch u&s;age might be di&s;pen&s;ed with; the argument was admitted to be good, and the monk only demanded a proof of the con&s;anguinity; which was demon&s;trated in the following manner:&mdash;"A bi&s;hop," &s;aid they, "in England, is always called <HI>Mi|lor,</HI> (my Lord) which ea&s;ily, in Italian, is corrupted into <HI>Minor;</HI> then <HI>Becket</HI> as ea&s;ily degenerates into <HI>Betti;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Milor-Becket,</HI> naturally becomes <HI>Minor-betti."</HI> This notable argument was deemed &s;o valid, that the relic was brought out of the convent to the &s;ick man.</P>
<P>Among in&s;tances of foreign barbari&s;m, the Floren|tines make them&s;elves very merry with the behaviour of the confe&s;&s;or of <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> at the door of the Me|dicean library. This confe&s;&s;or, attended the young prince, when he went to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Tu&s;can dominions. Being the only per&s;on in the &s;uite, the cut of who&s;e garment promi&s;ed any &s;cholar&s;hip; the librarian, concluding he mu&s;t long to &s;ee one of the mo&s;t &s;pendid monuments, which the munificence of princes ever dedicated to literature, immediately waited on him, with a very re&s;pectful invitation. He received the compliment tolerably well, and a day was fixed. The director of the library had collected all the mo&s;t eminent <HI>literati</HI> in Florence; and the con|fe&s;&s;or, after partaking of a very elegant collation,
<PB N="161" REF="167">
moved towards the library, followed by this re&s;pect|able company. On coming to the door he &s;topped; and, after gazing about him for an in&s;tant, called out to the director, "Mr. Librarian, have you got the the book of the Seven Trumpets here?" The director &s;aid he had not; and the whole company, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, owned they had never heard of &s;uch a book. "Well then," &s;aid the confe&s;&s;or, turning back, "your whole library is not worth a pipe of tobacco." No time was lo&s;t to get an account of this book; which was found to be a collection of pious &s;tories, put into Spani&s;h, for the u&s;e of the lowe&s;t of the com|mon people in Spain.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing aeras of the republic, com|merce, banking, and indu&s;try were the nurture and &s;upport of the nobility. <HI>Co&s;mo de Medicis</HI> became the principal man in the &s;tate, becau&s;e he was the prin|cipal merchant and banker of Florence, if not of all Europe. <HI>Peter</HI> his &s;on, and <HI>Laurence</HI> his grand&s;on, continued commerce, and banking. All the public and private edifices of any celebrity were erected by merchants; and the greater part by per&s;ons in the woollen trade. To this manufacture the republic of Florence chiefly owed its grandeur. The names of the commercial hou&s;es, at the head of the paper, linen, wood, tile, chee&s;e, and coal trades, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="168">Commerce at Florence is now reduced to a very low ebb, in compari&s;on to what it was formerly. The woollen manufacture, in particular, &s;carce &s;upplies the common people; as to all the fine cloth, it is import|ed from England.</P>
<P>Of &s;ilk, Tu&s;cany produces an immen&s;e quantity; which, though of &s;uch &s;uperior quality, is exported raw. The regency, however, to keep &s;uch a valu|able commodity in the country, and thereby encou|rage indu&s;try, have prohibited its exportation. Ac|cordingly, former manufacturers are reviving, and new ones &s;etting up. All exports of this kind, &s;uch as &s;attins, dama&s;ks, velvets, are well executed, the colours fine, and the patterns elegant, and drawn with ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Jewellery, and porcelain, the manufactories of which have continued in Tu&s;cany from the ancient Etru&s;|cans, and Intagliatas, employ a con&s;iderable number of hands, though they can &s;carce be accounted branches of commerce.</P>
<P>Dying was formerly carried on to a very great ex|tent; as the territory of Tu&s;cany produces a plant &s;aid to be a good &s;ub&s;titute for indigo; and which might ea&s;ily be fown in &s;uch quantities, as to make a con&s;i|derable article of exportation.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="169">The wine all round Florence is in great reque&s;t all over Italy. It is both &s;tomachic and light; and thus unites the <HI>genero&s;um</HI> and <HI>lene,</HI> which was its great recommendation to the ancients.</P>
<P>Among the many excellent regulations, which owe either their origin or improvement to this country, we have omitted financing; the importance and ad|vantages of which mu&s;t be e&s;timated by the brilliant, and &s;olid fortunes gained by it; and not from the calamity of the countries, which have been the the|atre of its &s;peculations.</P>
<P>This &s;cience, with which the more northern coun|tries are little acquainted, was, for a long time, culti|vated by the Florentines; who managed it with all that dexterity, and addre&s;s, for which they were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in commerce. It was one of the principal re&s;ources in the la&s;t &s;truggles for liberty, in the years 1530, and 1531. Tho&s;e, who followed the fortunes of <HI>Catherine de Medicis</HI> into France, finding the country fallow, began tilling it with <HI>financing,</HI> which la&s;ted during part of the reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. The chief contractors were Florentines; either &s;uch as had quitted their country, or &s;till kept an e&s;tabli&s;hment at Florence; the very terms, in financing, be&s;peak the country from whence they originated; mo&s;t of them being borrowed from the Italian.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="170">The Grand Duke's ordinary income is computed at three millions of pia&s;ters a year. In 1753, it was re-re&s;olved that in future the entire military force, of this great duchy, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t only of three regiments of foot, and one of dragoons of five hundred men. In 1755, another regiment of dragoons was added, and the militia was formed into regiments; but the Great Duke is &s;aid, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, to be able to bring into the field 30,000 men; and to fit out twenty &s;hips of war, twelve gallies, and &s;ome cutters.</P>
<P>Of this duchy, the chief officer, at pre&s;ent, is a governor, appointed by the Great Duke. He re|&s;ides at Florence; where is al&s;o a council of regency, the military board, and other officers of &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Republic of Saint Marino.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;mall &s;tate, inclo&s;ed by Romagna and Urbino, is under the Popes protection; it has already la&s;ted near fourteen centuries, and is &s;aid to have its origin in the following manner. <HI>Marino,</HI> a Dalmatian by birth, and a ma&s;on by trade, betook him&s;elf to a lonely mountain here; where his au&s;tere and &s;olitary life gained him &s;uch a character for &s;anctity, that the prince&s;s of the country made him a pre&s;ent of the country, to di&s;po&s;e of it at his own di&s;cretion. This reputation quickly peopled it, and gave ri&s;e to the republic which calls it&s;elf after his name. So that the common wealth of Marino may boa&s;t, at lea&s;t, of a nobler origin than that of <HI>Rome;</HI> the one, at fir&s;t, having been an a&s;ylum for robbers and murderers; and the other the re&s;ort of per&s;ons eminent for their piety, and devotion. The be&s;t of their churches is dedicated to the &s;aint, and holds his a&s;hes. His &s;tatue &s;tands over the high altar, with
<PB N="166" REF="172">
the figure of a mountain in his hands; which is al&s;o the arms of the common wealth. They attribute to his protection the long duration of their &s;tate; and look on him as the greate&s;t &s;aint, next the ble&s;&s;ed virgin. In their &s;tatute-book, they have enacted a law again&s;t &s;uch as &s;peak di&s;repectfully of him; who are to be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame manner, as tho&s;e convicted of bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>The town, and republic of <HI>Saint Marino,</HI> &s;tands on the top of a very high, and craggy mountain. It is generally hid among the clouds. There is not a &s;pring, or fountain in the whole dominions; but they are always well provided with large ci&s;terns, and re&s;er|voirs of rain, and &s;now-water.</P>
<P>This mountain, and a few neighbouring hillocks that lie &s;cattered about the bottom of it, is the whole circuit of their dominions. They have, what they call, three ca&s;tles, three convents, and five churches; and reckon about five thou&s;and inhabitants in their community.</P>
<P>The people are divided into three cla&s;&s;es; nobles, citizens, and pea&s;ants. The council of &s;tate is formed from all three; twenty cho&s;en from each, who act for life. Every &s;ix months they elect two chiefs to pre&s;ide, called captains, who are inve&s;ted with &s;uch
<PB N="167" REF="173">
a power as the old Roman con&s;uls had; but the office is never to be continued to the &s;ame per&s;on's turn &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; the one is taken from the nobles, the other from the city, or country. There is no &s;uperiority between them, or di&s;tinction, but in the nobleman's taking the right hand. The third officer is the commi&s;&s;ary; who judges in all civil, and crimi|nal matters: he is allowed the fine which tho&s;e per|&s;ons are obliged to pay, who are found culpable be|fore him, by the council, or jury. Becau&s;e the many alliances, friend&s;hips and intermarriages, as well as the per&s;onal feuds, and animo&s;ities, that hap|pen, among &s;o &s;mall a people, might ob&s;truct the court of ju&s;tice, if one of their own number had the di&s;tri|bution of it, they have always a foreigner for this employ; whom they chu&s;e for three years, and main|tain out of the public &s;tock. He mu&s;t be a doctor of law, and a man of known integrity. He is joined in commi&s;&s;ion with the two captains, or chiefs; and acts &s;omething like the recorder of London, under the Lord Mayor.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician is the fourth man in the &s;tate, and is allowed 200 crowns a year. He is obliged to keep a hor&s;e, vi&s;it the &s;ick, and in&s;pect all the drugs that are imported. He mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, thirty-five years old; a doctor of the faculty, and eminent for his religion, and hone&s;ty; that his ra&s;hne&s;s or ignorance
<PB N="168" REF="174">
may not unpeople the commonwealth; and, that they may not long &s;uffer under a bad choice, he al&s;o is elected only for three years.</P>
<P>Another per&s;on, who makes no ordinary figure in the republic, is the &s;chool-ma&s;ter; and &s;carce any of the inhabitants are to be met with, who have not &s;ome tincture of learning.</P>
<P>No clergy are admitted into their government; and once a year, three young women are given in marriage, with a fortune of thirty-three crowns each.</P>
<P>No execution, &s;ays <HI>Northall,</HI> had ever been re|membered here by the per&s;on who gave me an ac|count of the place; though he was one of the nobles, and upwards of fifty years of age. So that, <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that the people are e&s;teemed very hone&s;t, and vigorous in the execution of ju&s;tice; and &s;eem to live more happy, and contented, among their rocks, and &s;nows, than the re&s;t of the Italians, in the plea&s;ante&s;t valleys of Italy. Nothing can be a greater in&s;tance of the love mankind have for liberty, and their aver&s;ion to arbitrary government, than to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;avage mountain covered with people, and the campagna of Rome, almo&s;t de&s;titute of inhabitants.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Country, Climate.</HEAD>
<P>THE Venetian territories, in Italy, are bounded by the country of the Gri&s;ons; by Trent, and the province of Tyrol, towards the North; by Carniola, and the gulph of Venice, to the Ea&s;t; by Mantua and Ferrara to the South; and by the Duchy of Milan to the We&s;t; being about 180 miles in extent, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; an hundred in breadth, toward the ea&s;t end, but &s;carce half that breadth towards the we&s;tern extremity. They are &s;ituated in
<PB N="170" REF="177">
thirteen degrees of Ea&s;t longitude, and forty-five degrees of North latitude.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands, on which the city of Venice &s;tands, were formerly &s;ubject to Padua; the Goths, and other northen people, invading Italy in the fifth century; the inhabitants of Padua, Aquileia, and other cities on the continent, fled thither for &s;helter, and formed a republic.</P>
<P>The Venetians &s;oon became very rich and power|ful, having by their indu&s;try engro&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the Levant trade; from Alexandria, and the ports of A&s;ia, they al&s;o brought all the rich merchandize of India, and the ea&s;tern nations; and di&s;tributed them all over Europe. They were then, in a manner, &s;overeigns of the Mediterranean, as well as the Adriatic &s;eas; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Morea, the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and the Levant; they &s;ubdued great part of Italy, North of the Po; and, in con|junction with the French, reduced the city of Con|&s;tantinople, and &s;everal other places on the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia, and Europe; but, upon the Portugue&s;e di&s;|covering the way to India by the cape of Good Hope, their trade, and con&s;equently their wealth, and power declined. They lo&s;t mo&s;t of the Grecian i&s;lands, and likewi&s;e their territories on the continent of Italy; but the latter they recovered. The Morea was taken
<PB N="171" REF="178">
from them in 1715, in a &s;ingle campaign. They, however, &s;till retain I&s;tria, Morlachia, the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Dalmatia, and the adjacent i&s;lands; be&s;ides the Paduan, Verone&s;e, and other territories in Italy; of all which we &s;hall treat in their proper order, begin|ning with tho&s;e in Italy.</P>
<P>Some writers have divided the Venetian territo|ries, exclu&s;ive of the i&s;lands of Corfu, and in the Mediteranean, into five provinces; the duchy of Venice, comprehending the capital, and its adjacent little i&s;lands, Venetian Lombardy, <HI>La Marca Trevigiana</HI> one of the riche&s;t &s;pots in Italy; the duchy of Friuli; and I&s;tria on the Adriatic. The Venetians are al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fiefs in the kingdom of the two Sicilies; and the general population is e&s;timated at near three million of inhabitants.</P>
<P>The principal i&s;lands, at pre&s;ent in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, are Corfu, Zant, and Cephalonia; the former of which is calculated to have about fifty thou&s;and inha|bitants. The other i&s;lands, in the Mediterranean, con|tain about as many more.</P>
<P>The Venetian territories in Italy, being part of ancient Lombardy, there cannot be a finer climate, nor better air; if we except tho&s;e parts adjoining to the &s;ea-coa&s;t. The only &s;ea, which belongs to the
<PB N="172" REF="179">
Venetians, is the Adriatic; or Venetian gulph, as it is otherwi&s;e termed; at the bottom of which lies the capital. The tide ebbs, and flows, regularly twice in four and twenty hours; ri&s;ing about four feet at high water. Nor, if we may credit <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> are they in the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive that the &s;ea will leave their coa&s;t, which &s;ome writers have a&s;&s;erted, and that Ve|nice would, in time, become united to the continent. There is no part of Italy where fi&s;h is &s;o abundant, as in the gulph of Venice.</P>
<P>The &s;ea, and neighbouring rivers, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> furni&s;h the Venetian tables, at the proper &s;ea&s;ons of the year, with no le&s;s than &s;eventy-&s;even different kinds of fi&s;h; &s;everal of which are peculiar to the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The principal rivers are, the Po, the Piava, the Adige, the Sila, and the Brenta; all which fall into the Adriatic. This country is al&s;o well watered with lakes; the principal of which are the lake <HI>de Garda,</HI> being about thirty-five miles in length, and twelve in breadth; and the I&s;co, fifteen miles in length, and three in breadth.</P>
<P>The country, in general, is level, and as fertile as any part of Italy; it abounds in arable and pa&s;ture land, in vineyards, and plantations of mulberries.
<PB N="173" REF="180">
The road, between Verona and Padua, is very plea|&s;ant, being planted with great quantities of white mul|berry-trees, in &s;quares; the leaves of which not only furni&s;h food for their &s;ilk worms; and the mulberries food for their poultry and hogs; but the branches, like|wi&s;e, &s;erve to &s;upport the vines; which hang like gar|lands, from tree to tree; and within the inclo&s;ures, are fields of corn; which, in the&s;e hot countries, ripen much better within the &s;hades of the mulberry trees, than if they were expo&s;ed to the &s;un.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o great quantities of cattle, of all kinds, which travellers remark are, in general, either grey or white; but that their hogs are u&s;ually black; and their fle&s;h much &s;weeter, and better ta&s;ted than in France or England; this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to their food, as they are fed chiefly with truffles, which are a delicious root; they are al&s;o fed with the hu&s;ks of grapes, newly pre&s;&s;ed, che&s;nuts, mulberries, &amp;c. The Padua &s;heep are &s;aid to afford wool little inferior to that of England; and there is no country where there is &s;uch plenty of fowls, and all manner of game, as in the territories of Venice.</P>
<P>The Venetian territories, &s;ays <HI>Beaufort,</HI> are, in general, equally fertile with the mo&s;t cultivated parts of Italy. In &s;ome parts agriculture is carried to its highe&s;t pitch of perfection. There are, however, &s;ome
<PB N="174" REF="181">
mar&s;hes, and uncultivated land, in the di&s;tricts of Verona, I&s;tria, Friuli, and e&s;pecially in Dalmatia; the greate&s;t part of which is little better than a de&s;ert. It is owing to this circum&s;tance, that a &s;carcity of corn is generally felt, every four or five years. In ordinary years, all kinds of corn grows in great abun|dance, e&s;pecially maize; which is the principal &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the common people. Wine, culinary herbs, and fruits are, almo&s;t always, produced in great abundance; with re&s;pect to corn, though the continent &s;carce furni&s;hes enough for its own con|&s;umption, I&s;tria, Dalmatia, and the Venetian Levant, grow &s;uch large quantities, that a great deal is ex|ported. Several of the di&s;tricts produce very fine hemp and flax. The i&s;lands of the Levant abound with Corinthian grapes. Albania produces to|bacco of the very be&s;t quality; a great deal is like|wi&s;e brought from Sclavonia, and from Turkey. The &s;ilk that is produced in Lombardy, likewi&s;e, helps to &s;upport all the manufactures of the country. The mines of Bergamo, and Bre&s;cia, are al&s;o a great &s;ource of wealth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Cities.</HEAD>
<P>VENICE, in Latin <HI>Venetia,</HI> or <HI>Venetioe,</HI> the capital, and &s;eat of the republic, makes a very grand appearance at a di&s;tance; as &s;eeming, from its being built on a multitude of little i&s;lands, to float upon the &s;ea; or rather, with its &s;tately buildings, and &s;teeples, to &s;eem as it were ri&s;ing out of it. The number of the&s;e i&s;lands &s;till remains uncertain; &s;ome reckoning &s;ixty, others &s;eventy-two, and others again, making them amount to one hundred and thirty-eight. But the latter enumeration mu&s;t comprehend all tho&s;e places, which have gradually been rai&s;ed in the <HI>La|guna,</HI> by driving piles in the ground for building on. This city &s;tands, at lea&s;t, four miles from any part of the <HI>terra firma;</HI> and is, perhaps, the mo&s;t impregnable town in Europe. The <HI>Laguna,</HI> or mar&s;hy land, ly|ing between the city and the continent; which is five miles in breadth, is too &s;hallow for large &s;hips; but, by the attention of the republic, is prevented from
<PB N="176" REF="183">
becoming part of the continent, and from being ever &s;o frozen, as to bear an army. The acce&s;s to Venice, towards the &s;ea, is al&s;o difficult; but the &s;afe, and navigable parts are indicated by piles; which, at the approach of an enemy's fleet, can cut away. Be&s;ides, as a con&s;iderable number of gallies, and men of war, may be fitted out very expeditiou&s;ly for &s;ea, from the dock, which contains &s;uch va&s;t quantities of naval &s;tores; it is evident that the city, being thus &s;ecure from any attack, either by land or water, mu&s;t be, in a manner, impregnable, though it has no fortifi|cations. The fi&s;h, which are caught even at the very doors of the hou&s;es, may be reputed a good pre&s;er|vative again&s;t famine. The &s;everal canals leading to the city, among the &s;and banks, and mar&s;hy &s;hallows are, though at a va&s;t expence, kept clear of the mud, and &s;lime the food brings with it. Some of the&s;e canals, however, being very narrow, the mud is not &s;o effectually carried off, as to prevent ill &s;mell in hot weather.</P>
<P>The grand canal, which may not improperly be called the grand &s;treet, runs &s;erpentine through the city. Many noble buildings are on each &s;ide of it. But, wanting a beauty which the towns in Holland have, a quay, or &s;pace between the hou&s;es, and the canals, it looks like a town, over flowed with wa|ter,

coming clo&s;e to the &s;ides of the foundations of the buildings.</P>
<P>This canal, which divides the city into two parts, is one thou&s;and three hundred paces long. The way of going up, and down the city, is in Gondolas; which indeed &s;trike the eye of a &s;tranger, at fir&s;t &s;ight, with a very gloomy appearance; being all of them lined either with black cloth, or &s;erge, and painted black. They will not carry above four or five per|&s;ons; and as the awning is &s;o low, that no one can conveniently &s;tand upright in the gondola; when a &s;trangers gets into one of them, it &s;eems as if he was creeping into a her&s;e, or tomb, hung with black. The left &s;ide is always accounted the place of honour; becau&s;e he, who &s;its on the right, mu&s;t face the rower, who intercepts the view, and often unavoidably &s;pla&s;hes him.</P>
<P>The gondolas glide very &s;wiftly along the canals, and the gondoliers avoid each other with &s;urprizing exactne&s;s, and celerity; they make u&s;e of the word <HI>Stacando,</HI> or <HI>Stali,</HI> to &s;ignify, to tho&s;e coming another way, to keep on the right hand; and <HI>premando,</HI> or <HI>premi,</HI> as a notice to pa&s;s on the left; &s;o that gondolas &s;eldom run each other down.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="186">There is no conveyance in this town, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> but by water; out of the door of your lodg|ing, you &s;tep into your gondola, in&s;tead of your coach. A gondola with two oars, at Venice, is as magnificent, as a coach and &s;ix hor&s;es, with a large equipage in another country. The motion of them is extremely agreeable; two gondoliers manage one &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that they will whip round a &s;harp corner of their watery &s;treets, with more agility than the be&s;t coachman in London can take a &s;hort turn there. He that governs the helm &s;tands in the mo&s;t graceful attitude imaginable.</P>
<P>One cannot be an hour, on the&s;e canals, without &s;eeing &s;everal of the Barcaroles &s;hifting them&s;elves; for it is a cu&s;tom among them to have always a dry &s;hirt, ready to put on, the moment they have landed their fare; and they would expect to die, if, by any accident, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering a damp &s;hirt to dry on their bodies. On the other hand, it is curious to ob&s;erve how little they dread damp &s;heets, throughout Italy; and the people at inns are &s;o little apprized of an objection to damp &s;heets, that, when de&s;ired to hang them before the fire, they reque&s;t you will feel how wet they are; being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that you mean they have not been wa&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="187">Over the &s;everal canals are laid four hundred and fifty (&s;ome &s;ay upwards of five hundred) bridges, great and &s;mall, and the better part of them &s;tone; the highe&s;t, and longe&s;t is the Rialto; which, in the mid&s;t of the city, cro&s;&s;es the great canal, at its nar|rowe&s;t part; where it is but forty paces broad. The bridge con&s;i&s;ts of only one &s;ingle arch, and a very noble one it is; who&s;e foundation takes up ninety feet, re&s;ting on twelve thou&s;and elm piles, and every where incru&s;tated with marble. It is &s;aid to have co&s;t the republic two hundred and fifty thou&s;and ducats. In the upper part of it, it is thirty-&s;even paces broad; with two rows of &s;hops, forming, as it were, three &s;treets, on its upper &s;urface; of which that in the middle is the broade&s;t. At each end, is an a&s;cent of fifty-&s;ix &s;teps.</P>
<P>The view from the Rialto is equally lively and magnificent; the objects, immediately under the eye, are the grand canal, covered with boats, and gondo|las, and flanked on each &s;ide with magnificent pa|laces, churches, and &s;pires; but this fine pro&s;pect, according to <HI>Moore,</HI> is almo&s;t the only one in Ve|nice; for, except the grand canal, and the canal Regio, all the others are narrow and mean; &s;ome of them have no quays; the water literally wa&s;hes the walls of the hou&s;es. In going along the&s;e wretched canals, there is no one agreeable object, to cheer
<PB N="180" REF="188">
the &s;ight; and the &s;mell, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, is over|powered with the &s;tench, that exales from the&s;e waters.</P>
<P>The city may indeed be every where traver&s;ed on foot; but the &s;treets are very narrow, and the pave|ment, which is a &s;mooth white &s;tone, is very &s;lippery in wet weather. They are always kept very neat; however, no carriage, not &s;o much as a chai&s;e ever pa&s;&s;ing through them. The many &s;mall bridges, with their &s;teps, are not a little dangerous to cro&s;s over, from the &s;lipperine&s;s of the pavement, and their hav|ing, in general, no fence on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>In allu&s;ion to the &s;lipperine&s;s of the pavement, there is a proverb, advi&s;ing per&s;ons, to beware of the four P's, at Venice; namely, <HI>Pietra bianca, Putana, Prete,</HI> and <HI>Pantalone; i. e.</HI> a white &s;tone, a whore, a prie&s;t, and the la&s;t P may denote either mounte|banks and jugglers, or the nobility them&s;elves; that being a nick-name, given them, by the vulgar.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Venice has been celebrated, in the following lines, by the famous poet <HI>Sannagario;</HI> for each of which, the republic made him a pre&s;ent of one hundred <HI>louis-d'ors.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="182" REF="190">"A. Pray old gentleman by whom was the city of Venice founded? S. By <HI>Jupiter.</HI> A. Who contriv|ed its ar&s;enal? S. <HI>Minerva.</HI> A.

To <HI>Mi|nerva.</HI> No wonder, therefore, it &s;o far excels other cities, &s;ince it owes its origin to &s;o many deities."</P>
<P>The view of Venice, at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the town, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> is mentioned by many travel|lers, in terms of the highe&s;t admiration. I had been &s;o often forwarned of the amazement, with which I &s;hould be &s;truck, at fir&s;t &s;ight of this city, that when I actually did &s;ee it, I felt little or no amazement at all. You will behold, &s;aid tho&s;e anticipators, magni|ficent palaces, churches, towns and &s;teeples, all &s;tand|ing in the middle of the &s;ea. This, continues the above writer, is unque&s;tionably an uncommon &s;cene; and there is no manner of doubt that a town, &s;ur|rounded by water, is a very fine &s;ight; but all the travellers that have exi&s;ted, &s;ince the days of <HI>Cain,</HI> will not convince me that a town &s;urrounded by land, is not a much finer. Can there be any compari&s;on between the dull monotony of a watry &s;urface, and
<PB N="183" REF="191">
the delightful variety of gardens, meadows, hills and woods?</P>
<P>If the &s;ituation of Venice renders it le&s;s agreeable than another city, to behold at a di&s;tance, it mu&s;t render it in a much &s;tronger degree, le&s;s agreeable to inhabit. For it &s;hould be recollected, that in&s;tead of walking, or riding in the fields, and enjoying the fragrance of herbs, and the melody of birds; a per|&s;on, who wi&s;hes to take the air here, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be paddled from morning to night, in a narrow boat, along dirty canals; or, if he does not like this, he has one re&s;ource more, which is that of walking in St. <HI>Mark's</HI> place. The&s;e are the di&s;advantages which Venice labours under, with regard to &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Venice is &s;aid to be built in the &s;ea; that is, it is built in the mid&s;t of &s;hallows, which &s;tretch &s;ome miles from the &s;hore, at the bottom of the Adriatic gulph. Though the&s;e &s;hallows, being now all covered with water, have the appearance of one great lake, yet they are called, in the plural, lakes; becau&s;e, formerly, as it is imagined, there were &s;everal. In &s;ailing on the Lagunae, and looking to the bottom, many large hol|lows are to be &s;een; which, at &s;ome former period, have, very po&s;&s;ibly, been di&s;tinct lakes; though now, being all covered with a common &s;urface of water, they form one large lake, of unequal depth. The in|tervals
<PB N="184" REF="192">
between the&s;e hollows, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, were little i&s;lands, and are now &s;hallows; which, at ebb, are all within reach of a pole.</P>
<P>The lake, in which Venice &s;tands, is a kind of &s;mall inner gulph, &s;eparated from the large gulph by &s;ome i&s;lands, at a few miles di&s;tance. The&s;e i&s;lands, in a great mea&s;ure, break the force of the Adriatic &s;torms, before they reach the Lagunae; yet, in very high winds, the navigation of the lake is dangerous to gondolas; and, &s;ometimes, the gondoliers do not tru&s;t them&s;elves even on the canals, within the city. This is not &s;o great an inconvenience, as may be at fir&s;t imagined; becau&s;e mo&s;t of the hou&s;es have one door opening upon a canal, and another communicating with the &s;treet; by means of which, and the bridges, the inhabitants can go to almo&s;t any part of the town, by land as well as by water.</P>
<P>The whole city is &s;aid to be &s;ix Italian miles in cir|cumference; and, to make the tour of it in a gondola, takes up rather more than two hours. It contains &s;eventy pari&s;h churches, be&s;ides others; fifty-four convents of monks; twenty-&s;ix nunneries; &s;eventeen rich ho&s;pitals, eighteen oratories; forty religious fra|ternities, with their chapels: among which are &s;ix called <HI>Scuole grand&iacute;;</HI> fifty-three &s;quares; one hundred and fifty-five marble, and twenty-three bra&s;s, &s;tatues.
<FIGURE>

The buildings, indeed, are all of &s;tone; but the greater part makes &s;o mean an appearance, that this city, in point of beauty or elegance, can by no means be com|pared with many others. St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s &s;quare is cer|tainly very magnificent; and &s;o are &s;everal palaces bordering on the grand canal; though mo&s;t of them are of Gothic architecture. In the churches and cha|pels, what is mo&s;t to be admired are the paintings; which are even thought to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of Rome. Here are al&s;o two academies for painting.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants has been, by &s;ome, com|puted at two hundred thou&s;and, including tho&s;e in the adjacent i&s;lands, and &s;uch as live on the water. Others, who do not include the i&s;landers and the ma|riners, think, that during the carnival, the whole num|ber of people, at Venice, &s;carce exceeds this number. The principal inhabitants are the nobility, <HI>citadini,</HI> or citizens; after whom may be reckoned the lawyers, notaries, phy&s;icians, wealthy merchants, gla&s;s-makers, and all handicraft&s;men, whether dwelling in the city, or the i&s;lands; together with the &s;ea-faring people, and the gondoliers.</P>
<P>Venice, from the fertility of its neighbourhood, and the facility of carriage, enjoys a con&s;tant plenty of all kinds of provi&s;ions. The &s;pring-water being very indifferent, in mo&s;t places, almo&s;t every hou&s;e has a
<PB N="186" REF="195">
ci&s;tern; into which the rain-water is conveyed, from the roof, and clarified, being filtrated through &s;and. Water is al&s;o brought from the river Brenta, and pre|&s;erved in the ci&s;terns.</P>
<P>From this general &s;ketch, we now proceed to a more particular de&s;cription. Venice is divided into &s;ix large parts, called <HI>Se&s;tierie;</HI> of which the three fir&s;t lie on the ea&s;t, and north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the great canal; which, as we have before ob&s;erved, divides the city into two main parts; and three others, on the we&s;t, and &s;outh &s;ide.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of St. <HI>Mark</HI> contains the <HI>Piazza di S. Marco;</HI> which is one of the large&s;t, and fine&s;t &s;quares in Europe. This is the only &s;pot that one can call <HI>terra firma,</HI> in the whole city. It is &s;ur|rounded with magnificent buildings; and divided into the le&s;&s;er, and greater &s;quares. On each &s;ide of the large &s;quare are, what they call, the <HI>procuraties;</HI> a pile of buildings, like our inns of court, and inhabited by lawyers; underneath which are piazzas, &s;upported by marble pillars; where are coffee-hou&s;es and taverns. At one end &s;tands the church of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> and, ad|joining to it, is the le&s;&s;er &s;quare; having, on one &s;ide, the ducal palace; and the new <HI>procuraties,</HI> on the other. The &s;ea wa&s;hes the quay of this &s;quare; which is built of large hewn &s;tones, with &s;everal &s;tairs; where
<PB N="187" REF="196">
the gondolas land very conveniently. At the end of this le&s;&s;er &s;quare, are erected two lofty pillars of gra|nite, or &s;peckled marble; which are &s;aid to have been originally brought from Egypt to Con&s;tantinople; and removed from thence to Venice, in the time of the Doge <HI>Seba&s;tiano Zani,</HI> about the year 1192. After they had lain a whole year on the ground, they were erected by <HI>N. Barratier;</HI> who de&s;ired no other recompence for his trouble, than that any per&s;on might have free liberty to play at any game of chance, between the&s;e two pillars; all kinds of gaming being, at that time, prohibited. This reque&s;t was complied with; but the &s;enate, at the &s;ame time, ordered that the execution of criminals &s;hould, in future, likewi&s;e take place on that &s;pot; and criminals, condemned to &s;uffer death publicly, are &s;till executed between the&s;e pillars. On the pillar, that &s;tands next to the ducal palace, is a bra&s;s lion, being St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s &s;ymbol, with its head to|wards the Ea&s;t, as an emblem of the republic's domi|nion over &s;everal places in the Levant. On the other &s;ide &s;tands a marble &s;tatue of S. <HI>Theodore;</HI> or, as others will have it, of St. <HI>George;</HI> who holds his &s;hield in the right, in&s;tead of the left hand; which either proceeds from the &s;culptor's mi&s;take; or, per|perhaps, it was copied from an intaglio. But the Ve|netians pretend it was done de&s;ignedly, to expre&s;s the ju&s;tice of the republic; which, &s;ay they, aims only at defending it&s;elf, without doing any hurt, or injury, to
<PB N="188" REF="197">
other powers, A noble Venetian would not pa&s;s be|tween the&s;e two pillars, upon any terms; becau&s;e, when the Doge <HI>Falieri,</HI> who was beheaded, in 1354, for trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate, came to Venice, after his election, he was obliged to land between the&s;e two pil|lars, from the water being remarkably high. On the canal, oppo&s;ite to the&s;e two pillars, a galley, com|pletely rigged and armed, is kept in readine&s;s for any emergency.</P>
<P>At the corner of the new procuratie, a little di&s;|ance from the church, &s;tands the &s;teeple of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> This is a quadrangular tower, about three hundred feet in height. It is not uncommon in Italy for the church and &s;teeple to be in this &s;tate of di&s;-union. This &s;hocked a clergyman of my acquaintance very much, &s;ays <HI>Moore;</HI> he mentioned it to me, among the errors and ab&s;urdities of the church of Rome. This gentleman was clearly of opinion that church and &s;teeple ought to be as in&s;eparable as man and wife; and that every church ought to con&s;ider its &s;teeple as mortar of its mortar, and &s;tone of its &s;tone. An old captain of a &s;hip, who was pre&s;ent, declared him&s;elf of the &s;ame way of thinking; and &s;wore, that a church, divorced from its &s;teeple, appeared to him as ridiculous as a &s;hip without a ma&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198">The a&s;cent, to the top of this tower, is by &s;teps; but &s;o contrived that a per&s;on may ride up and down on hor&s;e-back; which <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> king of Poland once did, without meeting with any accident. On the top of it is a &s;pire, with an angel &s;ixteen feet high, cut in wood, and gilt. This tower has a gallery, which is quiet open above, and affords a very fine pro&s;pect. While the gilding of the &s;pire is bright, it may be &s;een at &s;ea, upwards of thirty miles. Nay &s;ome give out, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that when the gilding was quite fre&s;h, it could plainly be di&s;cerned off <HI>Capo d' I&s;tria,</HI> at the di&s;tance of one hundred miles from Venice. What <HI>Sabelli</HI> further &s;ays, that the foundation of this tower is laid as deep in the earth, as it is high above the &s;urface of it, may be looked upon as one of tho&s;e ga&s;conades, not uncommon among the Venetians.</P>
<P>At the bottom of this tower is a &s;mall neat build|ing of marble, called the <HI>Loggietta,</HI> where &s;ome of the procurators of St. <HI>Mark</HI> con&s;tantly attend to do bu&s;ine&s;s. Some people are of opinion, that, parti|cularly when the grand council, or the &s;enate, are a&s;&s;embled, the&s;e procurators are placed there, as &s;tate-centinels, to give warning in ca&s;e of any appearance of di&s;content, or commotion, among the populace; which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;hew it&s;elf at this place, as there is no other in Venice, where a mob could a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="199">A few paces from the church are three large poles, like the ma&s;ts of a &s;hip, erected on bra&s;s pe|de&s;tals of curious workman&s;hip; on which en&s;igns, and flags are hung, on days of public rejoicing. The&s;e are in memory of the three kingdoms, Cyprus, Can|dia, and Negropont, which once belonged to this republic; the three crowns are &s;till kept in the ducal palace. Since the kingdoms are gone, re|marks <HI>Moore,</HI> the crowns and the poles &s;eem &s;carce worth pre&s;erving; they are, however, of the &s;ame value to Venice, that the title of king of France is to his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The patriarchal church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> though one of the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t expen&s;ive in the world, does not &s;trike the eye very much at fir&s;t; the architecture is of a mixed kind, mo&s;tly gothic, yet many of the pillars are of the Grecian order; the out&s;ide is in|cru&s;ted with marble; the in&s;ide, ceiling and floor, are all of the fine&s;t marble.</P>
<P>The front, which looks to the palace, has five bra&s;s gates, with hi&s;torical bas-relieves; over the principal gate are placed the four famous bronze hor&s;es, &s;aid to be the workman&s;hip of <HI>Lycippus;</HI> they were given to the Emperor <HI>Nero</HI> by <HI>Tiridates,</HI> king of Armenia; the fiery &s;pirit of their countenances, and their ami|mated attitudes, are perfectly agreeable to their ori|ginal
<PB N="191" REF="200">
de&s;tination of being harne&s;&s;ed to the chariot of the Sun. <HI>Nero</HI> placed them on the triumphal arch con&s;ecrated to him, and they are to be &s;een on the rever&s;e of &s;ome of his medals; they were removed from Rome, to Con&s;tantinople, placed in the Hip|podrome by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and remained there till the taking of Con&s;tantinople, by the French and Vene|tians, in the beginning of the thirteenth century; when they were carried to Venice, and placed in St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s church.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ury of St. <HI>Mark</HI> is very rich, in jewels and relics; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to apply to one of the procurators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> for permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee it. I &s;hall only mention, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> a few of the mo&s;t valuable effects kept here. Eight pillars from <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s temple, at Jeru&s;alem; a piece of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s veil, &s;ome of her hair, and a &s;mall portion of her milk; the knife u&s;ed by our Saviour, at his la&s;t &s;upper; one of the nails of the cro&s;s, and a few drops of his blood. After the&s;e, it would be impertinent to enumerate the bones, and other relics of &s;aints and martyrs; of which there is a plentiful &s;how in this church; it would be unpardonable, however, to omit mentioning the picture of the Virgin, by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> From this, compared with his other works, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> it is plain, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> was a much better Evangeli&s;t, than a painter; there are many very good
<PB N="192" REF="201">
painters, who would have made very bad &s;aints; and here is an in&s;tance of an excellent &s;aint, who was but an indifferent painter.</P>
<P>The mo&s;aic paintings, on the out&s;ide of this church, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> which are &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by no works of art, delights us no le&s;s, on entering, with its number|le&s;s rarities. The flooring fir&s;t catches the eye, being being entirely paved with precious &s;tones, of the &s;econd rank, in &s;mall &s;quares, not bigger than a playing card, and &s;ometimes le&s;s. By the &s;econd rank in gems, I mean cornelian, agate, ja&s;per, &s;er|pentine and verd-antique; on which we place our feet without remor&s;e; but not without a very odd &s;en&s;ation, when we find the ground undulated beneath them to repre&s;ent the waves of the &s;ea, and perpe|tuate marine ideas, which prevail in every thing at Venice.</P>
<P>Of this trea&s;ury it was &s;aid, during the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. of Spain, that there was in it enough to pay &s;ix king's ran&s;oms; when <HI>Pachecho,</HI> the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador hearing &s;o much &s;aid of it, a&s;ked in de|ri&s;ion, if the che&s;t, in which the trea&s;ure is contained, had any <HI>bottom?</HI> and, being an&s;wered, in the affirma|tive, he replied, there was this difference, between his ma&s;ter's trea&s;ures, and tho&s;e of the Venetian re|public,
<PB N="193" REF="202">
that the mines of Mexico and Peru, had no bottom.</P>
<P>The church trea&s;ury, this lady adds, is old fa&s;hion|ed, but very rich, in gold and jewels. In it is kept a very famous manu&s;cript, of the go&s;pel of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> pretended to be autographical; but the dampne&s;s of the place, where it lies, has &s;poiled it to &s;uch a de|gree, that no part of it is any longer legible; and it is not &s;o much as certain whether it be written in Latin, or Greek. In the pavement of the portico of St. <HI>Marks</HI> is a &s;mall mor&s;el of porhyry, frequently ki&s;&s;ed by the people, who hold it in the highe&s;t ve|neration; on this piece of marble, the Emperor <HI>Bar|baro&s;&s;a</HI> pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the Popes feet, in 1175, when his Holine&s;s gave him ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Venetians have not only dedicated their fa|mous cathedral to St. <HI>Mark;</HI> but he is con&s;idered &s;o much the tutelar Saint of this city, that it is fre|quently called St. Marco, in Italian, in&s;tead of Venice. Of this cu&s;tom of calling Venice St. Marco, Mrs. <HI>Piozzi</HI> relates a plea&s;ant anecdote, which we &s;hall here in&s;ert, leaving it, as &s;he does, to our readers to pa&s;s over, or not, as they may think proper.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="203">The procurator <HI>Tron,</HI> a noble Venetian, it &s;eems was at Padua, and had a fancy to drive on, that after|noon, to Vicenza; but, being particularly fond of a favourite pair of hor&s;es, which drew his chariot that day, would by no means venture if it happened to rain; and took the trouble to enquire of Abbate <HI>Toaldo</HI> a celebrated profe&s;&s;or there, "whether he thought &s;uch a thing likely to happen from the ap|pearance of the &s;ky? The profe&s;&s;or, not knowing why the que&s;tion was a&s;ked, &s;aid, he rather thought it would <HI>not</HI> rain within four hours at &s;oone&s;t." In con&s;equence of this information, our &s;enator orders his equipage directly, got into it, and bid the driver make ha&s;te to Vicenza; but before he was half way on his journey, &s;uch torrents of rain came down from a black cloud, which bur&s;t directly over their heads, that his hor&s;es were drenched in wet, and their mor|tified ma&s;ter turned immediately back to Padua, that they might &s;uffer no further inconvenience. To pa&s;s away the evening, which he did not mean to have &s;pent there, and to quiet his agitated &s;pirits, by thinking on &s;omething el&s;e; he walked under the portico, to a neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e, where &s;ate the Abbate <HI>Toaldo</HI> in company of a few friends; wholly uncon&s;cious that he had been the cau&s;e of vexing the Procurator; who, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, cried out, in a true Venetian &s;pirit of anger, and humour odly bleaded together, <HI>"Mi dica Signor
<PB N="195" REF="204">
Profe&s;&s;ore Toaldo, chi &egrave; il pi&ugrave; gran mincion de tutti i &s;anti in Paradi&s;o?" Pray tell me Doctor,</HI> we &s;hould &s;ay in Engli&s;h, <HI>who is the greate&s;t blockhead of all the Saints in Paradi&s;e?</HI> The Abb&eacute; looked a&s;toni&s;hed, but hear|ing the que&s;tion repeated in a more peevi&s;h accent, gravely replyed, <HI>"Eccellenza non &s;on fatto io per ri&s;|pondere a tale dimande."&mdash;"My Lord, I know not what reply to make to &s;uch a que&s;tion."</HI> "Why then," re|plies the Procurator, "I will tell you my&s;elf. It is St. <HI>Mark,</HI> who is the greate&s;t blockhead, for keep|ing &s;o many profe&s;&s;ors to &s;tudy the &s;tars, when, with all their a&s;tronomy, not one of them can tell whether it will rain or no."</P>
<P>The church of the <HI>Redemtore</HI> is a curious in&s;tance of the power of art; for though it is not to be ranked among the rich, and expen&s;ive churches, abounding neither in gold, or fine marbles, yet the &s;implicity and elegance of its &s;tructure &s;urprized us very much, the moment we entered the door; and convinced us how de&s;ervedly <HI>Palladio</HI> is admired, and how po&s;|&s;ible it is to enjoy the beauty of proportion and de|&s;ign, without having &s;tudied the rudiments of the art.</P>
<P>The ducal palace is an immen&s;e building, entirely of marble. The front is very magnificent, being beautified with a great number of marble pillars of different orders. Did the other three &s;ides but corre|&s;pond
<PB N="196" REF="205">
with the principal front, there would not be a finer building in all Europe. Be&s;ides the apartments of the Doge, there are al&s;o halls, and chambers for the &s;enate, and all the different councils, and tribunals. The principal entrance is by a &s;pacious &s;tair-ca&s;e, called the giants &s;tair-ca&s;e, on account of two colo&s;|&s;al &s;tatues of <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>Neptune,</HI> placed at the top; they are of white marble, and intended to repre&s;ent the naval and military power of the &s;tate. Their gi|gantic &s;ize might be proper enough formerly, but they would be ju&s;ter emblems of this republic in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, if their &s;tature were more moderate.</P>
<P>Under the portico, leading to this &s;tair-ca&s;e, may be perceived the gaping mouths of lions, to receive anonymous letters, informations of trea&s;onable prac|tices, and accu&s;ations of magi&s;trates for abu&s;es in office.</P>
<P>From the palace, is a covered bridge of communi|cation to a &s;tate-pri&s;on, on the other &s;ide of the ca|nal. Pri&s;oners pa&s;s to, and from, the courts over this bridge, which is called <HI>Ponte di &s;o&s;piri,</HI> or <HI>bridge of &s;ighs.</HI></P>
<P>The apartments, and halls of the ducal palace, are ornamented by the pencils of <HI>Titian, Paul Verone&s;e, Tintoret,</HI> and other great painters. The rape of <HI>Eu|ropa,</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="206">
and the &s;torming of <HI>Zara,</HI> both by <HI>Paul Vero|ne&s;e,</HI> are among the highly e&s;teemed pieces of that ma&s;ter. The foot of <HI>Europa</HI> is honoured with the particular admiration of the connoi&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P>Within the palace, there is a little ar&s;enal, which communicates with the hall of the great council. Here a great number of mu&s;kets are kept ready charged, with which the nobles may arm them&s;elves, on any &s;udden in&s;urrection, or other emergency.</P>
<P>The lower gallery, or the piazza under the pa|lace, is called the <HI>Broglio.</HI> In this the noble Vene|tians walk and conver&s;e; it is only here, and at council, where they have opportunities of meeting together; for they &s;eldom vi&s;it openly, or in a family way, at each others hou&s;es, and &s;ecret meetings would give umbrage to the &s;tate-inqui&s;itors; they chu&s;e therefore to tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s on this public walk. People of inferior rank &s;eldom remain on the <HI>Broglio,</HI> for any length of time, when the nobility are there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides St. Mark's place, there is not another &s;quare, or <HI>place,</HI> as the French with more propriety call them, in all Venice. To compen&s;ate, however, for there being but one, there is a greater variety of objects to be &s;een at this one, than in any half-dozen
<PB N="198" REF="207">
of &s;quares, or places, of London or Paris. This &s;quare, ob&s;erves Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is particularly agreeable to walk in by night; the lights in the coffee-hou&s;es, illuminating the piazza, render it extremely chearful; and the concour&s;e of people, re&s;orting hither, to breathe the cool air, is &s;o con&s;iderable as to fill the whole &s;quare. The little &s;treets, leading from it, are well furni&s;hed with elegant &s;hops; which make the mo&s;t brilliant appearance, from the curious arrange|ment of their articles; and appear far exceeding the <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> of the <HI>foire S. Germain</HI> at Paris. The &s;treet of the &s;ilver&s;miths makes a &s;plendid &s;hew, there being no other &s;ort of &s;hops in it. That of the milliners and mercers is like a parterre of flowers; the goods of the mo&s;t glaring colours being ingeniou&s;ly mixed, in &s;uch a manner in the windows, as to produce a &s;trik|ing effect. Other &s;treets con&s;i&s;t &s;olely of poulterers, and, &s;ome, of green-grocers' &s;hops; the&s;e la&s;t are decked out in &s;uch a manner as di&s;covers &s;urprizing ta&s;te in the common people.</P>
<P>In the evening, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> there generally is here &s;uch a mixture of Jews, Turks, and Chri&s;tians; law|yers, knaves, and pickpockets; mountebanks, old women, and phy&s;icians; women of quality with ma&s;ks; &s;trumpets barefaced; and, in &s;hort, &s;uch a jumble of &s;enators, citizens, gondoliers, and people of every character and condition; that our ideas are
<PB N="199" REF="208">
broken, and disjointed in the croud, in &s;uch a man|ner, that one can think, or reffect on nothing; yet, this being a &s;tate of mind which many people are fond of, the place never fails to be well attended; and, in fine weather, numbers pa&s;s a great part of the night there. Although &s;uch a heterogeneous mixture of people throng the place, both day and night, yet there is no riot or di&s;turbance. The Venetians are &s;o ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ee &s;trangers, as not to be the lea&s;t &s;ur|prized at their being dre&s;&s;ed in a fa&s;hion different from them&s;elves; nor inclined to e&s;teem them objects of ridicule, on account of their not &s;peaking the Ita|lian language. As it is the cu&s;tom for the ladies, as well as the gentlemen, to frequent the ca&s;&s;inos, and coffee-hou&s;es, in the place St. Mark, it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of either Vauxhall or Ranelagh.</P>
<P>It is not in St. Mark's place we are to look for the fine&s;t monuments of the art of <HI>Titian,</HI> or the genius of <HI>Palladio;</HI> for the&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to vi&s;it the churches and palaces; but, not pretending, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to be a competent judge of painting and architecture, I have no new remarks to make on the&s;e &s;ubjects; and I wi&s;h to avoid a hackneyed repetition of what has been &s;aid by others. I was, be&s;ides, long ago taught a le&s;&s;on, which will effectually prevent me from every affec|tation of this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209">Very early in life, &s;ays our author, I re&s;ided about a year in Paris; and happened, one day, to accom|pany five or &s;ix of our countrymen, to view the pic|tures in the Palais Royal. A gentleman, who af|fected an enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion for the fine arts, parti|cularly that of painting, and who had the greate&s;t de&s;ire to be thought a connoi&s;&s;eur, was of the party. He had read the lives of the painters, and had the <HI>Voyage Pittore&s;que de Paris</HI> by heart. From the moment we entered the rooms, he began to di&s;play all the refine|ments of his ta&s;te; he in&s;tructed us what to admire, and drew us away, with every &s;ign of di&s;gu&s;t, when we &s;topped a moment at an uncelebrated picture. We were afraid of appearing plea&s;ed with any thing we &s;aw, till he informed us whether or not it was worth looking at. He &s;hook his head at &s;ome, to&s;&s;ed up his no&s;e at others; commended a few, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on every piece as he went along, with the mo&s;t im|po&s;ing tone of &s;agacity. "Bad, that <HI>Caravaggio</HI> is too bad indeed, devoid of all grace;&mdash;but here's a <HI>Ca|racci</HI> that makes amends; how charming the grief of that <HI>Magdalen!</HI> The Virgin, you'll ob&s;erve, gentle|men, is only fainting, but the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is quite dead.

<P>We at length came to St. <HI>John,</HI> by <HI>Raphael;</HI> and here this man of ta&s;te &s;topped &s;hort, in an extacy of admiration.&mdash;One of the company had already pa&s;&s;ed it, without minding it, and was looking on another picture; on which the connoi&s;&s;eur bawled out&mdash;"Good God, Sir! what are you about?" The hone&s;t gentle|man &s;tarted, and &s;tared around, to know what crime he had been guilty of.</P>
<P>"Have you eyes in your head, Sir?" continued the connoi&s;&s;eur? "Don't you know St. <HI>John</HI> when you &s;ee him?"</P>
<P>"St. <HI>John!</HI>" replied the other in amazement. "Aye Sir, St. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, <HI>in propria per&s;ona.</HI></P>
<P>"I don't know what you mean, Sir," &s;aid the gen|tleman, peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P>"Don't you," rejoined the connoi&s;&s;eur; "Then "I'll endeavour to explain my&s;elf. I mean St. <HI>John</HI> in the wilderne&s;s, by the divine <HI>Raffaelle Sangio da Urbino;</HI> and there he &s;tands, by your &s;ide.&mdash;Pray, my dear Sir, will you be &s;o obliging to be&s;tow a little

<P>We &s;tood li&s;tening, in &s;ilent admiration, and began to imagine we pecreived all the perfections he enu|merated; when a per&s;on, in the Duke of <HI>Orlean</HI>'s &s;ervice, came and informed us, that the original, which he pre&s;umed was the picture we wi&s;hed to &s;ee, was in another room; the Duke having allowed a painter to copy it. <HI>That,</HI> which we had been looking at, was a very wretched daubing; done from the ori|ginal, by &s;ome ob&s;cure painter, and had been thrown, with other rubbi&s;h, into a corner; where the Swi&s;s had accidentally di&s;covered it, and had hung it up, merely by way of covering the vacant place on the wall, till the other &s;hould be re-placed.</P>
<P>How the connoi&s;&s;eur looked, on this trying occa|&s;ion, I cannot &s;ay. It would have been barbarous to have turned an eye upon him.&mdash;I &s;tepped into the next room, fully determined to be cautious in deciding on the merit of painting.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="212">Over again&s;t the ducal palace &s;tands the public li|brary of the republic. The poet <HI>Petrarch</HI> fir&s;t begun this collection, by giving his library to the &s;tate; upon condition that a decent edifice &s;hould be built, for its reception, at the public expence. After him, Cardi|nal <HI>Ba&s;&s;arion</HI> added his curious collection of Greek manu&s;cripts. Several other con&s;iderable additions have &s;ince been made to this library.</P>
<P>The paintings by <HI>Titian,</HI> and &s;everal other cele|brated ma&s;ters, together with &s;everal antiquities, and Greek and marble &s;tatue, which are to be &s;een here, merit particular notice. Among the latter, the mo&s;t &s;triking is the rape of <HI>Ganymede,</HI> by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the &s;hape of an eagle; which &s;ome take to be the work of <HI>Phidias.</HI> A <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> two gladiators, <HI>Leda, Paris,</HI> and &s;everal bu&s;ts of the Roman emperors, are al&s;o exqui&s;itely done.

<P>The ar&s;enal at Venice is a fortification, of between two and three miles in compa&s;s. On the ramparts are many little watch-towers, where centinels are &s;tationed. Like the ar&s;enal at Toulon, it is at once a dock-yard, and a repo&s;itory for military &s;tores. Here the Vene|tians build their &s;hips, ca&s;t their cannon, make their
<PB N="204" REF="213">
cables, &s;ails, anchors, &amp;c. The arms are arranged here, as in other places of the &s;ame kind, in large rooms, divided into narrow walks, by long walls of mu&s;kets, pikes, and halberts.</P>
<P>In one of the docks is kept the Bucentaur, or ve&s;&s;el the Doge is carried in, to e&s;pou&s;e the Adriatic. This ve&s;&s;el is kept under cover, and never taken out, but for the e&s;pou&s;als. It is formed for containing a very numerous company, is finely gilt and ornamented within; and loaded, on the out&s;ide, with emblematical figures in &s;culpture. This ve&s;&s;el may, po&s;&s;ibly, be ad|mired by land&s;men, but will not much charm a &s;ea|man's eye; being a heavy broad-bottomed machine, which draws little water; and, con&s;equently, may be ea&s;ily over&s;et in a gale of wind. Of this, how|ever, there is no great danger, as two precautions are taken to prevent &s;uch an accident; one of which &s;eems calculated to quiet the minds of believers; and the other to give confidence to the mo&s;t credulous. The fir&s;t is u&s;ed by the Patriarch; who, as &s;oon as the ve&s;&s;el is afloat, takes care to pour into the &s;ea &s;ome holy-water, which is believed to have the virtue of preventing, or allaying &s;torms. The &s;econd is en|tru&s;ted to the admiral; who has the di&s;cretionary power of po&s;tponing the marriage-ceremony, when the bride &s;eems in the &s;malle&s;t degree boi&s;terous.
<PB N="205" REF="214">
One of the virtues of the holy-water, that of allay|ing &s;torms, is, by this means, rendered &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>But, when the weather is quite favourable, the ceremony is performed every A&s;cen&s;ion-day. The &s;olemnity is announced in the morning, by the ring|ing of bells, and firing of cannon. About mid-day the Doge, attended by a numerous party of the &s;enate and clergy, goes on board the Bucentaur; the ve&s;&s;el is rowed a little way into the &s;ea, accompanied by the &s;plendid yachts of the foreign amba&s;&s;adors, the gondolas of the Venetian nobility, and an incredible number of barks and gallies of every kind. Hymns are &s;ung, and a band of mu&s;ic performs, while the Bu|centaur, and her attendants, &s;lowly move towards St. Lido, a &s;mall i&s;land, two miles from Venice. Prayers are then &s;aid; after which the Doge drops a ring, of no great value, into the &s;ea, pronouncing the&s;e words &mdash; <HI>De&s;pon&s;amus te, mare, in &s;ignum veri perpetuique dominii.</HI> He then returns, in the &s;ame &s;tate, inviting tho&s;e who accompany him in the galley to dinner.</P>
<P>This ve&s;&s;el, remarks Mr. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> is called the identical one, in which Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> performed the original ceremony, &s;o far back as the year 1171; and though, perhaps, not a whole plank, of that old galley, can be now remaining in this, &s;o often careened, re|paired,
<PB N="206" REF="215">
and adorned, &s;ince that time. I &s;ee nothing ridiculous, &s;he adds, in declaring that it is the &s;ame &s;hip; any more than in &s;aying that the oak, planted an acorn, thirty years ago, is the &s;ame tree I &s;aw &s;pring up then a little twig, which not even a moderate &s;ceptic will deny; though he takes &s;o much pains to per&s;uade plain folks out of their own exi&s;tence, by laughing us out of the dull notion, that he, who dies a withered old fellow at four&s;core, &s;hould ever be con&s;idered as the &s;ame per&s;on, whom his mother brought forth, a pretty little plump baby, eight years before.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the great number of palaces in this city; but we may, in general, ob|&s;erve that, with re&s;pect to architecture, tho&s;e built by <HI>Palladio,</HI> and other celebrated architects, are in a &s;tile quite different from the Roman, or the Florentine; both in the ornaments on the front, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the apartments within. The windows are, gene|rally, four &s;quares in height, arched at the top, and reaching quite to the floor; with balconies before them, through the lower part of the window; all the parts of which are made to open, from bottom to top, for letting in the air in hot weather. The middle of the front is, almo&s;t, entirely compo&s;ed of windows, for enlightening a long portico, or gallery, that pa&s;&s;es through the hou&s;e, in every &s;tory; and out of this
<PB N="207" REF="216">
gallery is the entrance into the apartments, on each hand. The mo&s;t magnificent are, generally, up two pair of &s;tairs; they have, &s;ometimes, a &s;tory of high apartments, and another of, what they call, mezzanine, or low ones, alternate; the former for &s;tate, the latter for the u&s;e of the family.</P>
<P>The floors, are, generally, of a red plai&s;ter; com|po&s;ed of pulverized marble and bricks, mixed with oil; it makes a beautiful appearance, and is very la&s;ting. The chambers of the grand floor are &s;eldom u&s;ed for any other purpo&s;e, than as lumber-rooms. Some|times, indeed, they are decorated with &s;tatues; or with arms and trophies, where the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e has been a military man; and, in &s;ome, the chambers are full of in&s;criptions, antique marbles, and other cu|rio&s;ities of the like kind.</P>
<P>The roofs of the hou&s;es, in Venice, are flat, and covered with tiles.</P>
<P>Venice, with a few alterations, remarks <HI>Sharpe,</HI> would be much more magnificent than it is at pre&s;ent: The windows, in&s;tead of &s;a&s;hes, are &s;till, as in other parts of Italy, made of &s;mall panes of gla&s;s, enclo&s;ed in lead; and, what has a &s;till meaner appearance, co|vered with iron grates, re&s;embling tho&s;e in pri&s;ons. The &s;hutters of their hou&s;es are plain deal boards,
<PB N="208" REF="217">
tacked together, without the lea&s;t form or decoration, and not painted, as in England; &s;o that when a pa|lace is &s;hut up, it has very much the re&s;emblance of a bridewell, or an ho&s;pital for lunatics. They like|wi&s;e lay on the roofs of their hou&s;es &s;uch heavy, clum&s;y tiles, as to offend the eye very much. Hou&s;e-rent is remarkably cheap, for &s;o large, and commercial a city; a hou&s;e of &s;eventy pounds a year, being equal to one of two hundred a year in other capitals.</P>
<P>The palaces are, in general, furni&s;hed with velvet and dama&s;k, fringed, or laced with gold. The doors, &s;kirting-boards, and wain&s;cotting, are painted in a mo&s;t elegant manner; with pale tints for the ground, and prettily ornamented with curious devices, fe&s;toons, fruits, &amp;c. They al&s;o paint in fre&s;co, on the walls, with much facility and ta&s;te. This is to be met with in the poore&s;t hou&s;es; and, where they do not go to the expence of painting the walls, their white-wa&s;h is of uncommon neatne&s;s: it is glo&s;&s;y, of a &s;oft colour, and never comes off.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome good pictures in the palaces, but not &s;uch capital collections as are to be &s;een at Rome, and Genoa. The Venetians, remarks Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> cover the walls of their palaces with pictures, and never think tho&s;e apartments properly furni&s;hed, un|til they have &s;uch as fill all the &s;paces from top to
<PB N="209" REF="218">
bottom, &s;o is completely to hide the hanging. This being their object, there are in all the collections ma|ny more bad pictures than good; and on entering a room, the number of paintings is &s;o great, that it is not till after &s;ome recollection one can di&s;criminate tho&s;e pictures, that merit attention, from among&s;t a chaos of glowing colours that &s;urround them; and which are frequently &s;o ill cla&s;&s;ed, that a picture which requires to be hung high, is, perhaps, the lowe&s;t in the room; whil&s;t another that cannot be &s;een too clo&s;e, perhaps, touches the cornice.</P>
<P><HI>Key&s;ler</HI> mentions the palace <HI>Grimaldi,</HI> as one of the mo&s;t elegant for its architecture, furniture, and curio&s;ities, both modern and antique. In the palace <HI>Barberigo</HI> is a weeping <HI>Magdalen,</HI> by <HI>Titian;</HI> for which the King of France is &s;aid to have offered forty thou&s;and crowns. This celebrated painter was de&s;|cended from a noble family, though in mean circum|&s;tances, and was born at Cadore, on the banks of the river Piave, in 1477 and died at Venice of the plague, in the year 1576 and the ninety-ninth of his age.</P>
<P>One of the &s;ingularities of this &s;ingular city, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> is its <HI>con&s;ervatories,</HI> or mu&s;ical &s;chools for in|&s;tructing young women in mu&s;ic: of the&s;e there are four; and, at each of them, they perform oratorios,
<PB N="210" REF="219">
and other pieces of &s;acred mu&s;ic, every Saturday, and and Sunday evening; and on other fe&s;tivals, in their convents. Indeed &s;uch is, and &s;uch has been, the rage for mu&s;ic throughout Italy, that improvements, in this &s;cience, have been equally encouraged by the &s;everal &s;tates, as improvements in policy or arts. Early as the 13th century, <HI>Guido Aretinus,</HI> a Benedictine Monk, having reformed the &s;cale of mu&s;ic, and invented a new method of notation, was invited, by Pope <HI>John,</HI> XX. to Rome; his improvements were patronized, and the Pope became his di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> in the church, when there was &s;ome very good mu&s;ic, both vocal and in&s;trumental; performed by the women of one of the&s;e charities. The gallery, having a lattice be|fore it, we could not di&s;tingui&s;h the performers; I therefore begged to be permitted to go into it, and &s;ee, as well as hear, the concert: my reque&s;t was granted; but when I entered, my eyes were &s;truck with the &s;ight of a dozen, or fourteen beldams, ugly and old; one blowing a french-horn; another &s;weat|ing at the ba&s;s-viol; another playing fir&s;t fiddle, and beating time with her foot, in the greate&s;t rage; others performing on ba&s;&s;oons, hautboys, and clarinets; the&s;e, with &s;everal young girls who formed the choir, and one who played upon the organ, compo&s;ed the concert; but, &s;uch a concert as I &s;hall never forget.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="220">About a mile from Venice, in the i&s;land of Mu|rano, are the great manufactories of looking-gla&s;&s;es. I &s;aw one very fine plate for a mirror, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> made in the pre&s;ence of the archduke, in a few mi|nutes. Though not &s;o large as &s;ome of the Paris ma|nufactory, yet it was much larger than I could have thought it in the power of human lungs to blow. In|&s;tead of being ca&s;t, as in France and England, the Murano mirrors are all blown in the manner of bot|tles. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee with what dexterity the the workman wields a long hollow cylinder of melted gla&s;s at the end of an iron tube; which, when he has extended as much as po&s;&s;ible, by blowing, and every other means his art &s;ugge&s;ts, he &s;lits with a &s;harp in|&s;trument; removing the two extremities from each other, and folding back the &s;ides: the cylinder now appears a large &s;heet of gla&s;s; which, being once more introduced into the furnace, is brought out a clear fini&s;hed plate.</P>
<P>This manufactory formerly &s;erved all Europe with looking-gla&s;&s;es; the quantity made here is &s;till con|&s;iderable; for although France and England, and &s;ome other countries, which &s;till get their mirrors from Venice, u&s;e a much greater quantity now, than for|merly; &s;o that, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Murano manufacturers have lo&s;t three-fourths of their cu&s;|tomers,
<PB N="212" REF="221">
they may &s;till retain half as much trade as ever they had.</P>
<P>It is &s;urprizing that, in&s;tead of blowing, they do not adopt the method of ca&s;ting; which is a much ea&s;ier proce&s;s, and, by which larger plates may be made. Be&s;ides mirrors, an infinite quantity of gla&s;s trinkets, (<HI>Margaritini,</HI> as they are called) of all &s;hapes and co|lours, are made here. Women, of the inferior ranks, wear them as ornaments, and ro&s;aries; they al&s;o mould this &s;ub&s;tance into many various, whim&s;ical forms, by way of ornamental furniture to hou&s;es and churches. In &s;hort, there are gla&s;s baubles enough made here, to bribe into &s;lavery half the inhabitants of the coa&s;t of Guinea.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the other Cities in Venetian Lombardy.</HEAD>
<P>PADUA, next in fame to Venice, may be com|pared to the &s;econd-rate cities in France, or England. Its &s;treets are lined with two rows of pi|azzas, be&s;ides &s;everal canals of clear running water,
<PB N="213" REF="222">
admirably contrived for the convenience of manu|facturers. Its &s;ituation is delightful; yet it is &s;o badly peopled, that, deprived of its mona&s;teries, pre|bends, &s;eminary, and what few &s;cholars its univer&s;ity &s;till draws thither, &s;carce a &s;oul would be left. The Paduans boa&s;t that the republic of Venice owes its origin, and ri&s;e, to their city; but it is now &s;ome centuries &s;ince Padua has been brought under the Venetian yoke; which has occa&s;ioned it to decline &s;o much, from its former &s;plendor, that at pre&s;ent, it &s;carce contains forty thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>The principal objects of curio&s;ity in this city are, the churches of St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> and St. <HI>Giu&s;tina; Il Salone;</HI> the buildings of the univer&s;ity, by <HI>Palladio;</HI> the bo|tanic and economical gardens; and the Mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>The church of St. Antonio, is a large Gothic building, begun in 1255, and fini&s;hed, in 1307; it has &s;ix domes, or cupolas, of which the two large&s;t compo&s;e the nave. It is extremely rich, and &s;o much ornamented, as to appear crowded with paint|ing and &s;culpture. There are four immen&s;e organs in it; and, even on common days, forty performers are employed in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The body of the Saint, is inclo&s;ed in a &s;arcopha|gus, under an altar in the middle of the chapel, and
<PB N="214" REF="223">
is &s;aid to emit a very agreeable and refre&s;hing &s;mell. Pious catholics believe this to be the natural effluvia of the &s;aint's body; while heretics a&s;&s;ert that the perfume (for a perfume there certainly is) proceeds from cer|tain bal&s;ams rubbed on the marble every morning, before the votaries come to pay their devotions.</P>
<P>The walls of this church are covered with votive offerings of ears, eyes, arms, legs, no&s;es, and every part almo&s;t of the human body; in token of cures performed by this &s;aint; for whatever part has been the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, a repre&s;entation of it is hung up in &s;ilver, or gold, according to the gratitude and wealth of the patient.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall di&s;tance from this church, is a place called the &s;chool of St. <HI>Antonio.</HI> Here many of his actions are painted in fre&s;co; &s;ome of them by <HI>Ti|tian.</HI> Many miracles, of a very extraordinary na|ture, are here recorded. There is one in particular, which, if often repeated, might endanger the peace of families. The &s;aint thought proper to loo&s;en the tongue of a new-born infant, and endue it with the faculty of &s;peech; on which the child, with an impru|dence natural to his age, declared, in an audible voice, before a large company, who was his <HI>real</HI> fa|ther. The miracles attributed to this celebrated &s;aint, greatly exceed in number, tho&s;e recorded by the
<PB N="215" REF="224">
Evangeli&s;ts of our Saviour; and, although it is not a&s;&s;erted that St. <HI>Antonio</HI> has not rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the dead, his admirers here record things of him, which are almo&s;t equivalent. When an im|pious Turk had &s;ecretly placed fire-works under the chapel, with an intention to blow it up, they affirm that St. <HI>Antonio</HI> hollowed three times from his marble coffin, which terrified the infidel, and di&s;covered the plot. The miracle is the more miraculous, as the &s;aint's tongue was cut out, and is actually pre&s;erved in a cry&s;tal ve&s;&s;el, and &s;hewn as a precious relic to all who have a curio&s;ity to &s;ee it. This difficulty was &s;tated as &s;eeming to bear a little again&s;t the au|thority of the miracle; and the ingenious per&s;on, to whom the objection was made, &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;ome|what nonplu&s;&s;ed; but, after recollecting him&s;elf, ob|&s;erved that this which &s;eemed an objection, was really a confirmation of the fact; for the &s;aint was not &s;aid to have &s;poken, but only to have hollowed, which a man can do without a tongue; but if his tongue had not been out, added he, there is no rea&s;on to doubt but that the &s;aint would have revealed the Turki&s;h plot in plain, articulate language.</P>
<P>In this Church is a monument of the famous Car|dinal <HI>Bembo,</HI> who was a man of great learning, and wrote very pure, cla&s;&s;ic Latin; it is &s;aid he was &s;o proud of his elegant, Latin &s;tile, that he would often
<PB N="216" REF="225">
&s;ay, he would not exchange it for the duchy of Man|tua. He is charged with having di&s;&s;uaded a friend from reading St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s epi&s;tles, and with never looking into the Bible, or breviary, for fear of cor|rupting the purity of his Latin &s;tile.</P>
<P>The next Church, in point of rank, but far &s;upe|rior in architecture, is that of St. <HI>Ju&s;tina,</HI> built from a de&s;ign of <HI>Palladio,</HI> and reckoned by many per&s;ons one of the mo&s;t elegant he ever gave; St. <HI>Ju&s;tina</HI> is &s;aid to have &s;uffered martyrdom, where the church was built, which was the rea&s;on of erecting it on that &s;pot. It would have been fortunate for the pictures in this church, if the &s;aint had &s;uffered on a piece of dryer ground; for they &s;eem con&s;iderably injured by the damps, which &s;urround the place where it now &s;tands. There is a wide area, in the front of the church, called the <HI>Prato della valle;</HI> where booths, and &s;hops, are erected for all kinds of merchandize, during the fairs. Part of this, which is never allowed to be profaned by the buyers and &s;ellers, is called <HI>Campo &s;anto;</HI> becau&s;e a great number of Chri&s;tian martyrs is &s;aid to have been put to death there.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Ju&s;tina</HI>'s church is adorned with many altars, embelli&s;hed with &s;culpture. The pavement is re|markably rich, being a kind of mo&s;aic work of marble, of various colours. Many other precious materials
<PB N="217" REF="226">
are wrought as ornaments to this church; but there is one &s;pecies of jewels, in which it abounds, more than, perhaps, any church in chri&s;tendom; which is the bones of martyrs. They have here a whole well full, belonging to tho&s;e who were executed in the <HI>Prato della valle;</HI> and what is of &s;till greater value, the Benedictines, to whom this church belongs, a&s;&s;ert, that they are al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bodies of the two Evangeli&s;ts, St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke.</HI> The Franci&s;cans, belonging to a convent at Venice, di&s;|pute the &s;econd of tho&s;e two great prizes; and de|clare that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the true body of St. <HI>Luke.</HI> The matter was referred to the Pope, who gave a deci&s;ion in favour of one of the bodies; but this does not prevent the proprietors of the other from &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their original claim; &s;o that there is no likelihood of the di&s;pute being finally de|termined, till the day of judgment.</P>
<P>The hall of the town-hou&s;e, in Padua; it is about three hundred Engli&s;h feet long, by one hundred in breadth. We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, which, like this, is &s;aid to be the large&s;t room, un&s;upported by pillars in Eu|rope, is only two hundred and &s;eventy feet in length, and &s;eventy-four in breadth. This immen&s;e hall is on the &s;econd floor, and ornamented with the bu&s;ts, and &s;tatues, of &s;ome eminent per&s;ons. The cenotaph
<PB N="218" REF="227">
of <HI>Livy,</HI> the hi&s;torian, who was a native of Padua, was erected here.</P>
<P>In this hall is to be &s;een a &s;tone, &s;uper&s;cribed with the following words:
<Q><HI>Lapis vituperii &amp; ce&s;&s;ionis bonorum.</HI></Q>
<Q>"The &s;tone of ignominy, and bankruptcy".</Q></P>
<P>Such as become bankrupt, and are unable to pay their debts, by &s;itting publickly three times, with their bare po&s;teriors on this &s;tone, and &s;wearing that it is not in their power to di&s;charge their debts, are cleared from any further pro&s;ecution from their cre|ditors.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity, formerly &s;o celebrated, is now like every thing el&s;e in this city, on the decline; the the|atre for anatomy could contain five or &s;ix hundred &s;tudents; but the voice of the profe&s;&s;or is like that of him who crieth in the wilderne&s;s. The licentious &s;pirit of the &s;tudents, which formerly was carried &s;uch unwarrantable lengths, and made it dangerous to walk in the &s;treets of this city at night, is now en|tirely extinct; it has gradually declined with the number of the &s;tudents. Whether the ardour for literature, for which the &s;tudents of this univer&s;ity
<PB N="219" REF="228">
were di&s;tingui&s;hed, has abated in the &s;ame proportion, we do not pretend to determine; but by far the greater number of young men, who now attend the univer&s;ity, are de&s;igned for the prie&s;thood, and apply to the &s;tudy of divinity as a &s;cience, for comprehend|ing and preaching the my&s;terious parts of which, a very &s;mall portion of learning has been ob&s;erved to &s;ucceed, better than a great deal.</P>
<P>There is a cloth-manufactory in this city, and it is &s;aid that the inhabitants of Venice, not excepting the nobles, wear no other cloth than what is made here. This particular manufactory, it therefore may be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ucceeds very well; but the exce&s;&s;ive number of beggars, with which this place &s;warms, is a &s;trong proof that trade and manufactures, in general, are by no means in a flouri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P>The air of Padua is reckoned very healthful. How|ever few cities have &s;o many apothecaries, in pro|portion to the number of inhabitants; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the&s;e venders of medicines are al&s;o confectioners. Great quantities of vipers are collected here; &s;ome of which are kept alive for va|rious u&s;es, and others dried and made into powder, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of great efficacy in medicine. They feed the fowls, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> with vipers, and meal at Naples; where they are al&s;o admini&s;tered
<PB N="220" REF="229">
to patients, as well as the broth made of the&s;e ani|mals. The be&s;t way of feeding fowls, is to cram them with a pa&s;te made with viper powder, and bar|ley meal, and then to give them milk to drink. Of the&s;e fowls the Neapolitans makes a jelly, and give it to con&s;umptive patients, and order them to continue drinking it for &s;ome weeks. This puts me in mind, adds the above writer, of Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> an Engli&s;h virtuo&s;o, who u&s;ed to fea&s;t his wife, who was a very beautiful lady, with capons, fattened with vipers fle&s;h; but he did not long enjoy his pampered idol, for &s;he died very young.</P>
<P>The territory of Padua is very &s;ubject to &s;torms; particularly tho&s;e which come from the &s;ea, and which are extremely violent.</P>
<P>For the honour of the mu&s;es, and the edification of the &s;tudents, it &s;eems the <HI>Donne libere,</HI> or <HI>Donne d&egrave;l mondo,</HI> as they are called, are publickly tolerated at Padua. The&s;e ladies have their re&s;pective dwellings appointed them, where they live together, &s;ix or eight in a cla&s;s, and offer them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the public. That &s;o commendable an in&s;titution may not be liable to any objection, it is the peculiar office of &s;everal phy&s;icians, frequently, and &s;trictly to examine the&s;e nymphs, that no bad con&s;equences may hap|pen to tho&s;e who conver&s;e with them. Of the&s;e
<PB N="221" REF="230">
public temples of <HI>Venus,</HI> there are two in the city of Padua; and, what &s;eems &s;omething out of character, one joins to a convent of monks, and the other to a nunnery.</P>
<P>The Jews have al&s;o their particular quarter al|lotted to them, at Padua, out of which they are not permitted to &s;tir.</P>
<P>Vicenza, about 18 miles di&s;tant from the above city, is charmingly &s;ituated, between two mountains, on a large plain: though but four miles round, it contains between thirty and forty thou&s;and inhabitants. The territory belonging to this city, on account of its fer|tility, is generally called the garden, and &s;hambles, of Venice. This city is the native place of <HI>Palladio;</HI> and the be&s;t works, of this celebrated architect con|&s;titute the chief ornament of the city. Though this city is of no very great extent, it is &s;uppo&s;ed there are in it above 60 churches, convents and ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Teatro Olympico</HI> is one of the fine&s;t &s;pecimens of modern architecture: it was begun early in 1588, the very year that <HI>Palladio</HI> died. The hou&s;e, in which the architect lived, was built by him&s;elf; and is no le&s;s mode&s;t than elegant. In the environs of this city may be &s;een the Marquis of <HI>Capra</HI>'s famous rotunda, copied by the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> at Chi&s;wick; and

which was built by <HI>Palladio.</HI> He was acce&s;&s;ary to the ruin of many great families at Vicenza, by draw|ing them into a ta&s;te for architecture. It is a&s;&s;erted there, that it was done from a motive of revenge, for having impri&s;oned his &s;on; who was an extravagant &s;pend thrift, during the father's ab&s;ence from Vicenza; who, on his return, gave them plans, and fal&s;e e&s;ti|mates, to induce them to begin, upon what he knew they could never fini&s;h.</P>
<P>The piazza, or great &s;quare of this city, makes a very noble appearance; being filled with elegant, and beautiful buildings, by this great architect.</P>
<P>There is in this city an academy, or literary &s;oci|ety, &s;tiled the <HI>Olympici;</HI> who&s;e de&s;ign is chiefly the im|provement of the Italian language. The academi|cians hold their meetings in the <HI>Teatro Olympico;</HI> which is &s;eldom u&s;ed as a theatre. The per&s;pective of the &s;tage, in this theatre, is admirable; and is de|corated with &s;tatues of the Roman emperors, and philo&s;ophers. The <HI>parterre,</HI> or pit, is likewi&s;e adorned with &s;everal &s;tatues; and the &s;eats are di&s;po&s;ed after the manner of the ancient amphitheatres.</P>
<P>In the <HI>campus martius,</HI> without the city, is a trium|phal arch, built from a de&s;ign of the above-mentioned
<PB N="223" REF="232">
<HI>Palladio,</HI> in imitation of the ancient &s;tructures of that kind.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t garden at Vicenza is that of the Count <HI>Valmanara;</HI> which, for its &s;ituation, hedges, vi&s;tas, ar|bours, and beautiful walks, may be reckoned one of the noble&s;t in Italy. A covered walk of cedar and orange trees, placed alternately, and above 200 paces in length, is particularly admired. On one &s;ide of it is a broad canal, well &s;tocked with fi&s;h; which, at the the &s;ound of a pipe, immediately appear in great num|bers, on the &s;urface, in order to be fed. Over the entrance into the garden is the following &s;ingular in|&s;cription, in Latin.</P>
<P>"If corrodoing cares have haply followed thee thus far, though they be loth to leave thee, di&s;pel and ba|ni&s;h them away. This place is more peculiarly dedi|cated to genial mirth and fe&s;tivity. Whoever &s;hall damage the&s;e cedars, or crop a flower, let him be ac|counted as a &s;acrilegious per&s;on, and be puni&s;hed; to appea&s;e <HI>Vertumnus</HI> and <HI>Pomona,</HI> to whom they are con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>"Native, friend, or &s;tranger, who de&s;ire&s;t to amu&s;e thy&s;elf with the rural charms of this place, thou maye&s;t &s;ecurely enter the&s;e gardens, de&s;igned for plea&s;ure and recreation. Here is no fierce dog, no frightful dra|gon,
<PB N="224" REF="233">
no deity with his threatening weapon; but every thing is here freely, and without danger, expo&s;ed to thy view. Such is the plea&s;ure of Count <HI>Leonardo Valmanara,</HI> owner of the gardens, who relies on thy mode&s;ty and good breeding, as &s;ufficient to protect the place from any outrage."</P>
<P>This country produces great plenty of excellent wine; particularly celebrated for its lenient qualities, in fits of the gout.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Vicenza are charged with being of a more vindictive temper, than the re&s;t of the Ita|lians; on which account they are commonly called <HI>Gli A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ini Vicentini,</HI> or, Vicentian a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. This is certain, that travellers, and e&s;pecially the Germans, who have the character of being hot and quarrel&s;ome, &s;hould be very careful, in every part of Italy, to avoid di&s;putes; and e&s;pecially with po&s;tillions, and per&s;ons of the lower cla&s;s; for the de&s;ire of revenge, in them, is &s;o predominant, that they have been known to fol|low a traveller &s;ix or &s;even &s;tages, to watch an oppor|tunity of gratifying this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Murder is looked upon in Italy in a very different light, to what it is in other countries. If a robbery has been committed, in any of the towns of Italy, and the populace is alarmed to &s;top the thief, there is always
<PB N="225" REF="234">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance at hand to pur&s;ue the criminal; but, on cry|ing after a murderer, no per&s;on offers to &s;tir; and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;aves him&s;elf by flying, unmole&s;ted, to a church or convent; where, to the great di&s;grace of the clergy, the villain receives all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he may e&s;cape the hands of the civil power.</P>
<P>The meane&s;t citizen of Vicenza, in &s;igning contracts, or other deeds, adds to his name the title of <HI>Comte Vicentino,</HI> or, Count of Vicenza; an empty piece of pride, which they derive from an an&s;wer, as is pre|tended, given by <HI>Charles</HI> V. who, when he was at Vi|cenza, to get rid of the importunate &s;olicitations of &s;everal of the rich citizens, to be made <HI>Counts,</HI> &s;aid, in je&s;t, <HI>Todos Contes;</HI> "I make you all counts."</P>
<P>Verona has been celebrated in the following di&s;tich:
<Q><L>Urbibus Italioe proe&s;tat Verona &s;uperbis</L>
<L>Aedibus, ingeniis, flumine, fonte, lacu.</L></Q>
<Q>"Verona &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the cities of Italy for &s;uperb buildings, the genius of its inhabitants, its rivers, its fountain, and its lake.</Q></P>
<P>However, as to beauty, it will not bear a compari|&s;on with many of the large cities, in the &s;outhern parts of Italy. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets of Verona are narrow,
<PB N="226" REF="235">
winding, and dirty; and the hou&s;es meanly built. The river Adige divides Verona into almo&s;t two equal parts; joined together by four &s;tone-bridges. The number of inhabitants is, at pre&s;ent, computed to be under 50,000; whereas, a century ago, they exceeded 70,000. The be&s;t &s;treet in the city is <HI>Il Cur&s;o;</HI> where the carnival amu&s;ements conclude, with foot-races.</P>
<P>In the town-hou&s;e the &s;tatues of &s;ix celebrated per|&s;ons, who were natives of Verona, are erected. The&s;e are the poets <HI>Catullus, Aemilius, Aemilius Marcus, Cor|nelius Nepos, Pliny</HI> the elder, and the architect <HI>Vitru|truvius,</HI> who lived in the reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>The chief magi&s;trates, by whom the Venetians go|vern this province, are the <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI> and the General. All civil affairs are under the direction of the former; and the latter has the care of the military. Both the&s;e continue in office no longer than 16 months.</P>
<P>Among the private buildings in this city, the palace of Count <HI>Maffei</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;plendid and magnificent. The great glory of Verona is in its ancient amphi|theatre; the arena and in&s;ide of which are perfect. It has 46 rows of &s;eats; and is calculated to hold near 24,000 people. When the Emperor was at Ve|rona,
<PB N="227" REF="236">
there were no le&s;s than 40,000 people crouded into it.</P>
<P>This celebrated amphitheatre, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;o many centuries, has, by the commendable care, and attention of the inhabitants, been kept in &s;uch good repair, that, in this re&s;pect, it is far preferable to, though not &s;o large as, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s theatre at Rome.</P>
<P>Near the amphitheatre is a mu&s;eum, or, collection of rarities and antiques; &s;ome of which are very cu|rious, and merit a particular examination. In this building is a kind of public room, for conver&s;ation and cards; where the people of fa&s;hion, in Verona, meet every evening. There is &s;carcely a &s;mall town in Italy, that has not &s;omething of this kind. Were a plan of this &s;ort adopted in &s;ome of the country towns in England, it might be productive of more &s;o|ciety, and rational amu&s;ement, than continually dining about, with country neighbours, and receiving vi&s;itors, &s;ome of whom are not very agreeable.</P>
<P>The chief commodities, that the Verone&s;e trade in, are phy&s;ical plants, oil, wine, with manufactures of linen, &s;ilk, and woollen. The goodne&s;s of the Ve|rona wine is mentioned by <HI>Pliny, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;io|dorus.</HI> The wines here have &s;omething of the flavour of the old Hungarian wines.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="237">The Verone&s;e women are well &s;haped, and of a fre&s;h complection; for which they are unque&s;tionably obliged to the goodne&s;s of the air. The neighbour|ing mountains con&s;tantly refre&s;h this city, during the heats of &s;ummer, with a cool evening breeze. And though the orange-trees are not expo&s;ed here, in winter, to the open air; yet the climate produces all kinds of fruits, and vegetables, in perfection.</P>
<P>Here are &s;ome magnificent gardens, belonging to a Signior <HI>Gazzuola.</HI> The owner was formerly a coun|&s;ellor, but procured the title of Count; and as <HI>Gazu|ola,</HI> in Italian, &s;ignifies a magpye, that bird is his coat of arms; with this motto, <HI>Loquendo, i. e.</HI> by &s;peak|ing. The&s;e delighful gardens he owes to his &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion. The former owner, who, it &s;eems, had many law-&s;uits on his hands, employed <HI>Gazzuola</HI> &s;o long to plead for him, that he had no other way of &s;atifying his demands, but by making over the hou&s;e and gardens to him. As &s;oon as <HI>Gazzuola</HI> had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he took down the arms of the former count, and put up his own, with the motto, <HI>loquendo,</HI> in&s;cribed under them; which, contrary to his intention, is in|terpreted as the means by which he acquired this property.</P>
<P>Lawyers, from time immemorial, have been looked upon in a very di&s;advantageous light. Even in <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>'s
<PB N="229" REF="238">
time they were become very contemptible at Rome; for they had departed from the dignity of their profe&s;&s;ion, and enriched them&s;elves, by chicanery and mal-practices; and the Emperor was, at la&s;t, obliged to dimini&s;h their number, and put a check to their avarice. In the time of <HI>Lewis,</HI> Emperor of Germany, it was &s;ound nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h a &s;olemn edict, to put a &s;top to their abu&s;es. However, no people, perhaps, ever &s;hewed a greater dete&s;tation for lawyers, than the ancient Germans. <HI>Lucius Florus</HI> relates, that no defeat was ever more bloody than that of <HI>Varius;</HI> nothing more &s;avage than the in&s;ults of the barbarians; e&s;pecially towards the pleaders of cau&s;es. Of &s;ome they plucked out the eyes, and cut off the hands of others; they &s;ewed up the mouth of one of them, having fir&s;t torn out his tongue; which a barbarian holding up in his hand, &s;arca&s;tically &s;aid, "Now cea&s;e to hi&s;s, viper."</P>
<P>The two other cities, that remain to be &s;poken of, in Venetian Lombardy, are Bre&s;cia and Bergamo.</P>
<P>Bre&s;cia, the capital of a province of the &s;ame name, is a hand&s;ome, large, and populous city, on the river Garza. The number of inhabitants are &s;aid to be 100,000; the figure of it is almo&s;t &s;quare; with the ca&s;tle at one corner. This city is remarkable for its iron-works; and the fire-arms, that are made here,
<PB N="230" REF="239">
are famous through all Italy. The theatre is &s;plen|did; the boxes much ornamented with gla&s;&s;es, paint|ings, front-cloth of velvet, or &s;ilk fringed; the &s;eats in the pit are roomy; every row of this, and of the boxes, is numbered.</P>
<P>The environs of this city, though not naturally fer|tile, have been converted into a garden, by force of indu&s;try, a judicious choice of manure, and the &s;kilful di&s;tribution of water, The people, of this city and province, are treated better by the Venetians, than the re&s;t of their &s;ubjects; for, having been formerly part of the Milane&s;e territory, and being a frontier province, if oppre&s;&s;ed, they might think of returning to their old ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Bergamo, the capital of another fertile and populous province, the inhabitants of which are very indu&s;|trious, is &s;ituated on a mountain, overlooking a plain, covered with trees, as far as the eye can reach. As you approach it, the appearance of the &s;uburbs, with the city ri&s;ing above, and the mountain crowned with the citadel, is very fine. It is not near &s;o populous as Bre&s;cia; many of the inhabitants quitting the town to &s;eek a livelihood at Milan, Genoa, and other places. Bergamo is the native country of <HI>Harlequin;</HI> and the people have a &s;ort of humorous repartee, and an arch manner which, with their peculiar jargon, gives them
<PB N="231" REF="240">
an air different from that of other Italians. The in|habitants are, many of them, troubled with large wens, or &s;wellings in their throats, occa&s;ioned, as it &s;aid, by their drinking &s;now-water.</P>
<P>The plain of Bergamo is divided into three parts, by the river; and that part which lies between the Bremba and the Adda, called the I&s;ola, is not natu|rally &s;o fertile as the other two; but the produce is much more con&s;iderable. It has twelve communities, or pari&s;hes, that vie with each other, in carrying cultivation to its utmo&s;t extent. They do every thing with the &s;pade, and reckon four acres a main|tenance for five per&s;ons; the whole exhibits a &s;ight more truly plea&s;ing, than all the pompous pageantry of churches and palaces.</P>
<P>The&s;e two latter cities are &s;uppo&s;ed, each, to con|tain 14, or 15,000 inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Character, Cu&s;toms, Manners, and Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>WERE I, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> to form an idea of the character of the Venetians, from what I have &s;een, I &s;hould paint them as a lively, ingenious people, extravagantly fond of public amu&s;ements, with an uncommon reli&s;h for humour; and yet more attached to the real enjoyments of life, than to tho&s;e which depend on o&s;tentation, and proceed from vanity.</P>
<P>The common people of Venice di&s;play &s;ome qualities, very rarely to be found in that &s;phere of life; being remarkably &s;ober, obliging to &s;trangers, and gentle in their intercour&s;e with each other.</P>
<P>The poor people live very well in the city of Ve|nice, which may be, in a great mea&s;ure, a&s;cribed to their ignorance of gin, and brandy. They love gaming, and are con&s;equently often needy; but go|vernment
<PB N="233" REF="242">
connives at it, and is rather plea&s;ed to have them &s;o. As for tho&s;e who by &s;ickne&s;s, or other ac|cidents, are reduced to poverty, there is an abund|ance of charitable foundations; however, the &s;warms of beggars are &s;urprizingly great. The trade of beg|ging, in all catholic countries, will nece&s;&s;arily pro&s;per &s;o long as that &s;pecies of charity, which is be&s;towed on beggars; continues to be inculcated by their preach|ers and confe&s;&s;ors, as the mo&s;t perfect of all moral duties.</P>
<P>The Venetians, in general, are tall and well made. Though equally robu&s;t, they are not &s;o corpulent as the Germans. The latter al&s;o are of fair com|plexion, with light grey, or blue, eyes; but the Ve|netians are, for the mo&s;t part, of a ruddy brown co|lour, with dark eyes. The women are of a fine &s;tile of countenance, with expre&s;&s;ive features, and a &s;kin of a rich carnation. They dre&s;s their hair in a fan|ciful manner, which becomes them very much. They are of an ea&s;y addre&s;s, and have no aver&s;ion to cultivate an acquaintance with tho&s;e &s;trangers, who are pre&s;ented to them by their relations, or come properly recommended.</P>
<P>Though the Venetian government is &s;till under the influence of jealou&s;y, that gloomy daemon is now en|tirely bani&s;hed from the bo&s;om of individuals. In|&s;tead
<PB N="234" REF="243">
of the confinement in which women were form|erly kept at Venice, they now enjoy a degree of freedom unknown even at Paris.</P>
<P>The hu&s;bands &s;eem at lea&s;t convinced, that the cha&s;tity of their wives is &s;afe&s;t under their own guar|dian&s;hip; and that when a women thinks her honour unworthy her own regard, it is &s;till more unworthy of his. This advantage, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, that when a hu&s;band believes his wife has adhered to her conjugal vow, he has the additional &s;atisfaction of knowing &s;he acts from a love to him, or from &s;ome honourable motive; whereas, formerly, a Venetian hu&s;band might think him&s;elf obliged to bars, and bolts, for his wife's cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>Could any man imagine that a woman, when cha&s;|tity was pre&s;erved by &s;uch means, was more re&s;pect|able than a pro&s;titute? The old plan of bolts and bars, without even &s;ecuring its object, mu&s;t have had &s;trong tendency to deba&s;e the minds of both hu&s;band and wife; for what man, who&s;e mind was not perfect|ly abject, could have plea&s;ure in the &s;ociety of a wife, who langui&s;hed to be in the arms of another? Of all the humble employments that ever the wretch|ed &s;ons of <HI>Adam</HI> &s;ubmitted to, that of watching a wife, from morning to night, and all night too, is the mo&s;t perfectly humiliating. Such ungenerous di&s;tru&s;t mu&s;t
<PB N="235" REF="244">
al&s;o have had the wont effect on the minds of the women, and made them view their gaolers with di&s;|gu&s;t, and horror; and we ought not to be &s;urprized if &s;ome preferred the common gondoliers of the lakes, and the vagrants of the &s;treets, to &s;uch hu&s;|bands.</P>
<P>Along with jealou&s;y, <HI>poi&s;on,</HI> and the <HI>&s;tiletto</HI> have been bani&s;hed from Venetian gallantry, and the in|nocent ma&s;k &s;ub&s;tituted in their places. According to the be&s;t information I have received, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> this &s;ame ma&s;k is a much more innocent matter than is generally imagined. In general, it is not intended to conceal the per&s;on who wears it; but only u&s;ed as an apology for his not being in full dre&s;s. With a ma&s;k &s;tuck in the hat, and a kind of black mantle, trimmed with lace of the &s;ame colour, over the &s;houlders, a man is &s;ufficiently dre&s;&s;ed for any a&s;&s;em|bly at Venice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who walk the &s;treets, or go to the play-hou&s;es, with ma&s;ks actually covering their faces, are either engaged in &s;ome love-intrigue, or would have the &s;pectators think &s;o; for this is a piece of affec|tation which prevails here, as well as el&s;ewhere; and tho&s;e <HI>refined</HI> gentlemen, who are fond of the repu|tation, though they &s;hrink from the cata&s;trophe of an intrigue, are no uncommon characters here. I be|lieve
<PB N="236" REF="245">
this the more readily, adds <HI>Moore,</HI> becau&s;e I daily &s;ee many feeble gentlemen tottering, about in ma&s;ks, for whom a ba&s;on of warm re&s;torative &s;oup &s;eems more expedient, than the mo&s;t beautiful wo|man in Venice.</P>
<P>One evening, at St. Mark's place, when a gentle|man of my acquaintance was letting me into the &s;e|cret of this curious piece of affectation he de&s;ired me to take notice of a Venetian nobleman of his acquaintance; who, with an air of my&s;tery, was conducting a female-ma&s;k into his <HI>Ca&s;&s;ino.</HI> My acquaintance knew him perfectly well, and a&s;&s;ured me he was the mo&s;t innocent creature with women, he had ever been acquainted with; when this gallant per&s;on perceived we were looking at him, his ma&s;k fell to the ground, as if by accident; and, after we had got a complete view of his countenance, he put it on with much hurry, and immediately ru&s;hed, with his partner, into the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ino.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;&s;inos</HI> are &s;mall hou&s;es of one, or two rooms on a floor, neatly fitted up, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> but never fine; tho&s;e I &s;aw, &s;he adds, were papered with India paper, and furni&s;hed with chintz. It is the fa&s;hion here, for every per&s;on of di&s;tinction to have one <HI>Ca&s;&s;ino,</HI> at lea&s;t, and very frequently more: they have little plea&s;ure in inhabiting their palaces,
<PB N="237" REF="246">
which are really uncomfortable; and by the &s;ituation, and dimen&s;ions, rendered extremely melancholy. A &s;ilent and &s;olitary magnificence reigns throughout; interrupted only by the hoar&s;e wa&s;hing of the &s;ea, again&s;t the walls; which cannot be very exhilarating to the &s;pirits. It was therefore, mo&s;t probably, in &s;earch of chearfulne&s;s, recreation, and &s;ociety, that <HI>Ca&s;&s;inos</HI> were originally re&s;orted to; the greater part of them are &s;ituated behind St. Mark's place. Here &s;mall <HI>Cotteries</HI> meet, play cards, generally &s;up to|gether, on &s;ome trifle, procured from the pa&s;try-cooks, and coffee-hou&s;es; and often pa&s;s the night in conver&s;ation, mu&s;ic, or in walking about the place of St. Mark.</P>
<P>The&s;e places, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> have the misfortune to labour under a very bad reputation; they are accu|&s;ed of being temples entirely con&s;ecrated to lawle&s;s love; and a thou&s;and &s;candalous tales are told to &s;trangers concerning them; tales, not believed indeed, by the Venetians them&s;elves; the proof of which is, that the <HI>Ca&s;&s;inos</HI> are allowed to exi&s;t; for it is ab&s;urd to imagine that men would &s;uffer their wives to enter &s;uch places, if they were not convinced that tho&s;e &s;tories were ill founded; nor can we believe, after all we have heard of the profligacy of Venetian man|ners, that women, even of indifferent reputations, would attend <HI>Ca&s;&s;inos</HI> in the open manner they do, if
<PB N="238" REF="247">
it were under&s;tood that more liberties were taken with them, there, than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The opening, before St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s church, is the only place in Venice, where a great number of people can a&s;&s;emble. It is the fa&s;hion to walk here a great part of the evening, to enjoy the mu&s;ic, and other amu&s;e|ments; and although there are coffee-hou&s;es, and Venetian manners permit ladies, as well as gentle|men, to frequent them; yet it was natural for the noble, and mo&s;t wealthy, to prefer little apartments of their own; where, without being expo&s;ed to in|tru&s;ion, they may entertain a few friends, in a more ea&s;y and unceremonious manner, than they could do at their palaces. In&s;tead of going home to a formal &s;upper, and returning afterwards to this place of amu&s;ement, they order coffee, lemonade, fruit, and other refre&s;hments to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ino.</HI></P>
<P>That the&s;e little apartments may be occa&s;ionally u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of intrigue, is not improbable; but that this is the ordinary and avowed purpo&s;e, for which they are frequented, is of all things the lea&s;t credible.</P>
<P>Some writers, who have de&s;cribed the manners of the Venetians, as more profligate than tho&s;e of other nations, a&s;&s;ert, at the &s;ame time, that the government
<PB N="239" REF="248">
encourages this profligacy, to relax and di&s;&s;ipate the the minds of the people, and prevent their planning, or attempting any thing again&s;t the con&s;titution. Were this the ca&s;e, it could not be denied, that the Venetian legi&s;lators di&s;play their patrioti&s;m in a very extraordinary manner; and have fallen upon as extra|ordinary means of rendering their people good &s;ub|jects. They fir&s;t erect a de&s;potic court to guard the public liberty; and, next, corrupt the morals of the people, to keep them from plotting again&s;t the &s;tate. This la&s;t piece of refinement, however, is no more than a conjecture of &s;ome theoretical poli|ticians, who are apt to take facts for granted, with|out &s;ufficient proof; and afterwards di&s;play their in|genuity in accounting for them. That the Venetians are more given to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, than the inhabi|tants of London, Paris, or Berlin, will not be diffi|cult to prove; but as the &s;tate-inqui&s;itors do not think proper, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical are not allowed, to interfere in affairs of gallantry; as a great number of &s;trangers a&s;&s;emble twice or thrice a year, at Ve|nice, merely for the &s;ake of amu&s;ement, and, above all, as it is the cu&s;tom to go about in ma&s;ks; an idea prevails, that the manners are more licentious here, than el&s;ewhere. This cu&s;tom of wearing a ma&s;k, by conveying the ideas of concealment, and di&s;gui&s;e, has contributed greatly to give &s;ome people an impre&s;&s;ion of Venetian profligacy.

<HI>Moore,</HI> it is not a piece of white, or black paper, with disjointed features, that I &s;u&s;pect; having often found the mo&s;t complete worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s concealed under a &s;mooth, &s;miling piece of human &s;kin.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of <HI>Cavalieri &s;erventi</HI> prevails univer|&s;ally here; this u&s;age would appear in a proper light, and take off a great part of the odium thrown upon the Italians, if the <HI>Cavalieri &s;erventi</HI> were called hu&s;bands: for the real hu&s;band, or beloved friend, of a Venetian lady, is the <HI>Cici&s;beo.</HI> The hu&s;band, married in church, is the choice of her friends, not by any means of the lady. It is from this ab&s;urd ty|ranny that the chu&s;ing of <HI>Cici&s;beos,</HI> and <HI>Cavalieri &s;er|venti,</HI> has taken its ri&s;e; and will never be relin|qui&s;hed in Italy, whil&s;t the &s;ame incongruous combi|nations con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Venetian ladies have a gay manner of dre&s;&s;ing their heads; which becomes them extremely when young, but appears ab&s;urd, when age has furrowed over their fine &s;kins, and brought them almo&s;t to the ground. I felt a &s;hock at the &s;ight of a tottering old pair, I &s;aw enter a coffee-hou&s;e, in the place St. Mark, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar;</HI> they were both &s;haking with the pal&s;y, bearing on each other, and &s;upporting them&s;elves by a crutch-&s;tick; though they were bent almo&s;t double, by the weight of years and infirmities,
<PB N="241" REF="250">
yet the lady's head was dre&s;&s;ed with great care; a little ro&s;e-coloured hat, nicely trimmed with blond, was &s;tuck ju&s;t above her right ear, and over her left, was a &s;mall knot of artificial flowers; her few grey hairs behind were tied with ribbon, but &s;o thinly &s;cattered over her forehead, that large patches of her &s;hrivelled &s;kin appeared between the parting curls. The <HI>Cavaliere</HI> was not dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;tile; all his elegance con&s;i&s;ted in an abundance of ivy flow|ing over his &s;houlders. Enquiring who this vene|rable couple were, I learnt that the gentleman had been the faithful <HI>Cavaliere</HI> of the &s;ame lady, above 40 years; that they had regularly frequented the place, St. Mark, and the coffee hou&s;es; and with the mo&s;t &s;teady con&s;tancy had loved each other, till age and di&s;ea&s;e were conducting them both, hand in hand, to the grave.</P>
<P>However, a forty years con&s;tancy is far from being univer&s;al at Venice; coquettes are to be found there, as well as el&s;ewhere. I have &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances of coquetry at four&s;core; a <HI>donna nobile,</HI> whom a catarrh and <HI>Satan</HI> had bound, lo! the&s;e eighteen years! was &s;u&s;taining her&s;elf on the arm of a bri&s;k cice&s;beo, about five and twenty.</P>
<P>By a late regulation, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> the par|titions which formed a kind of cells, in the lower end

of the coffee-hou&s;es, and into which two or three people might retire and fa&s;ten the door, are now taken away, and the rooms are quite open and pub|lic. At fir&s;t the &s;enate had determined to exclude the women entirely from entering them; but, on their remon&s;trating very violently again&s;t &s;uch a mea&s;ure, they were allowed the liberty of appearing publicly, but were ab&s;olutely forbidden to retire into any private room; and the little rooms were, without exception, ordered to be thrown into the large ones.</P>
<P>Another law was at the &s;ame time promulgated, that if any <HI>fille de joye</HI> is found walking the &s;treets about the place, St. Mark, &amp;c. for the fir&s;t offence, &s;he is to have her head completely &s;haved, and &s;uffer impri&s;onment for a time &s;pecified; and, for the &s;econd offence, her eye-brows are likewi&s;e to be &s;haved; &s;he is al&s;o to be branded between the eyes, and then ba|ni&s;hed the republic.</P>
<P>The courte&s;ans here, &s;ays <HI>Northall,</HI> are the mo&s;t in&s;inuating, and have the mo&s;t alluring arts of any, in all Italy.</P>

<P>From the following anecdote, by Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> one would imagine they looked upon the Engli&s;h as little better than Heathens. A woman of quality, &s;ays &s;he, neare whom I &s;ate at a very grand ball,
<PB N="246" REF="255">
enquired how I had pa&s;&s;ed the morning. I named &s;everal churches I had looked into, particularly that which they e&s;teem beyond the re&s;t, as a favourite work of <HI>Palladio,</HI> and called the <HI>Redentore.</HI> "You do very right," &s;ays &s;he, "to look at our churches, as you have none in England, I know&mdash;but, then you have &s;o many other fine things&mdash;&s;uch charming <HI>&s;teel buttons</HI> for example;" pre&s;&s;ing my hand, to &s;hew that &s;he meant no offence; for, added &s;he, <HI>chi pen&s;a d'una maniera; chi pen&s;a d'un altra.</HI> Different peo|ple have different ways of thinking.</P>
<P>There is a univer&s;al politene&s;s here, in every rank; the people expect a civil deportment from their nobles toward them, and they return it with much re&s;pect, and veneration; but &s;hould a noble a&s;&s;ume an in&s;olent, arrogant manner, towards his inferior, it would not be borne with. I was at fir&s;t, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> &s;urprized at the quick tran&s;ition, from the frothy compliments of tho&s;e who champ the bit of a de&s;potic government, and the &s;tyle of compliment in Venice. The highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, in this way, being <HI>gentil donna;</HI> which &s;ignifies, hone&s;t woman, or wo|man of honour; and, upon entering a &s;hop, the trade&s;man addre&s;&s;ing me to know what I would have, called me <HI>cara ella;</HI> dear &s;he, or dear ma'am; when at Rome, or Naples, &s;uch a man would have &s;tyled me <HI>Excellenza, Illu&s;tri&s;&s;ima.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="256">To try Venetian ladies, by Engli&s;h rules, would be wor&s;e than the tyranny complained of, when a native of India was condemned, on the Coventry act, for flitting his wife's no&s;e, which was a common practice in his own country. Here is no &s;truggle for female education, as with us; no re&s;ources in &s;tudy, no duties of family management; no bills of fare to be looked over in the morning, no account-book to be &s;ettled at noon; no nece&s;&s;ity of reading to &s;upply, without di&s;grace, the evening's chat; no laughing at the card-table; no tittering in the corner, if a <HI>lap&s;us linguoe</HI> has produced a mi&s;take, which malice never fails to record. A lady in Italy is certain of applau&s;e, let her take ever &s;o little pains to obtain it.</P>
<P>A cu&s;tom which prevails here of wearing little or no rouge, and increa&s;ing the native palene&s;s of their &s;kins, by &s;carce lightly wiping the white powder from their faces, is a method no Frenchwoman of quality would adopt; yet the Venetians are not be|hind hand, in art of gaining admirers; and they do not, like their painters, depend upon colouring to en&s;ure it.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a greater proof of the little con|&s;equence, which dre&s;s gives to a woman, than the re|flection we mu&s;t make on a Venetian lady's mode of appearance in her Zindalet; without which no

A &s;keleton wire upon the head, &s;uch as we u&s;e to make up hats; throwing loo&s;ely over it a large piece of black mode, or Per&s;ian, &s;o as to &s;hade the face like a curtain; the front being trimmed with a very deep black lace, or &s;oufflet gauze, infinitely becoming. The thin &s;ilk, that remains to be di&s;po&s;ed of, they roll back &s;o as to di&s;cover the bo&s;om; fa&s;ten it with a puff before, at the top of their &s;tomacher; and once more rolling it back from the &s;hape, tie it gracefully behind, and let it hang in two long ends.</P>
<P>The evening ornament is a &s;ilk hat, &s;haped like a man's, and of the &s;ame colour, with a white or work|ed lining at mo&s;t, and &s;ometimes <HI>one feather;</HI> a great black &s;ilk cloak lined with white, and perhaps a nar|row border down before, with a va&s;t heavy round handkerchief of black lace, which lies over neck and &s;houlders, and conceals &s;hape and all completely. Here is &s;urely little appearance of art, no craping, or frizzing the hair, which is flat at the top, all of one length, and hanging in long curls about the back or &s;ides, as it happens. No brown powder, and no rouge at all. Thus, without variety does a Vene|tian

lady contrive to delight the eye, and without much in&s;truction, to charm the ear.</P>
<P><HI>Key&s;ler</HI> &s;ays there is a particular college in&s;tituted at Venice, to who&s;e care the regulation of dre&s;s is committed, by the republic. None are exempted from the juri&s;diction of this college but noblemen's wives, the two fir&s;t years after their marriage, and &s;trangers. The former, however, are no farther in|dulged, than in wearing a pearl necklace, and a gold fringe at the bottom of their gowns; and in giving their gondoliers ribbons to wear on their caps. But here al&s;o, as in other countries, the women are con|nived at, in this re&s;pect, particularly the courte&s;ans; who readily find patrons, under who&s;e protection they tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t this &s;umptuary law, with impunity; though there is, &s;ometimes, an in&s;tance of one, or two, being fined, on that account.</P>
<P>All the <HI>nobili</HI> wear black; and the importation of foreign cloth is totally prohibited. We have already taken notice of the black lining of the gondolas; but this re&s;triction is limitted to tho&s;e belonging to the city of Venice: for the Venetian &s;ubjects, on the main land, are at full liberty, as to this article.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="259">The noble Venetians are even obliged to paint, and line their gondolas with black; in order to pre|vent the extravagant expences that would ari&s;e from an emulation to outvie each other, in the &s;plendor of the&s;e naval equipages. Foreigners are at liberty to &s;pend what money they plea&s;e in fine gondolas; but few &s;trangers &s;tay long enough in this city, to make u&s;e of this political indulgence: &s;o that the only per&s;ons, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves &s;plendidly in gon|dolas, are the foreign mini&s;ters who always make entries in them. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the gondolas are extremely gay, being decorated with the fine&s;t paint|ings, gildings, and &s;culpture.</P>
<P>Strangers are under le&s;s re&s;traint in this city, re|&s;pecting many particulars, than the native inhabitants. There are many, who, after having tried mo&s;t of the capitals of Europe, have preferred living at Venice; on account of the variety of amu&s;ements, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, and the perfect freedom allowed in every thing, except in blaming the mea|&s;ures of government. If a &s;tranger is &s;o imprudent to give his tongue liberties, in this re&s;pect, he will either receive a me&s;&s;age to leave the territories of the &s;tate, or one of the <HI>Sbirri</HI> will be &s;ent to accompany him to the Pope's, or the Emperor's dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="260">The hou&s;es are thought inconvenient, by many of the Engli&s;h; they are better calculated, however, for the climate of Italy, than if they were built according to the London model. The floors which, as we have before remarked, are of red plai&s;ter, with a brilliant glo&s;&s;y &s;urface, appear much more beautiful than wood; and are preferable, in ca&s;e of fire, who&s;e progre&s;s they are calculated to check.</P>
<P>The principal apartments being on the &s;econd floor, perhaps, is owing to their being farther removed from the moi&s;ture of the lakes; or, it may be, to their being better lighted, and more chearful. Though the inhabitants of Great Britain make u&s;e of their fir&s;t floors for their chief apartments, this does not form a complete demon&s;tration that the Venetians are in the wrong, for preferring the &s;econd. When an acute &s;en&s;ible people univer&s;ally follow one cu&s;tom, in a mere matter of conveniency, however ab&s;urd that cu&s;tom may appear, in the eyes of a &s;tranger, at fir&s;t fight, it will generally be found that there is &s;ome real advantage in it, which compen&s;ates all the appa|rent inconvenience. Of this travellers, who do not hurry, with too much rapidity, through the countries they vi&s;it, are very &s;en&s;ible; for, after having had time to weigh every circum&s;tance, they often &s;ee rea|&s;on to approve, what they had formerly condemned.

ta&s;te of beauty, or excellence of every kind. What, from a variety of cau&s;es, has become the &s;tandard in one country, is, &s;ometimes, ju&s;t the contrary in another. The &s;ame thing that makes a low-brimmed hat appear genteel, at one time, makes it ridiculous at another.</P>

<P>OF all the diver&s;ions, which this city affords to &s;trangers, the carnival is generally accounted the principal one. Young per&s;ons, who &s;eek for en|tertainment only in debauchery, and exorbitant licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, may, at this time, if not &s;atiate their de&s;ires, at lea&s;t tire them&s;elves. But the diver&s;ions at this, and other fe&s;tivals, e&s;pecially on A&s;cen&s;ion-day, are of &s;uch a nature, that, to take an habitual delight in &s;uch a di&s;&s;olute manner of living, a per&s;on mu&s;t have laid a&s;ide all regard to decency, and morality.</P>
<P>The <HI>courtezans,</HI> who tender their &s;ervices here, at this time, are the mo&s;t abandoned wretches, and
<PB N="253" REF="262">
lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of mode&s;ty and decorum; and, for the mo&s;t part, have been, for their debaucheries and vil|lanies, driven out of the neighbouring imperial domi|nions; often bearing, on their backs, marks of the pu|ni&s;hed, more than once &s;uffered, by the hands of the common hangman.</P>
<P>The Italians, in general, are exce&s;&s;ively fond of ma&s;querades; and go, generally, ma&s;ked, during the whole time of the carnival. The ma&s;querade dre&s;s, at Venice, con&s;i&s;ts only of a night-gown; or a cloak, with a ma&s;k on the face. The general u&s;e of ma&s;ks prevents a &s;tranger from making any acquaintance, at this &s;ea&s;on; and likewi&s;e from &s;eeing any curio&s;ities; for no per&s;on is permitted to go into a church, or convent, in any kind of di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger is &s;oon tired of the Ridotto at Venice; and, as the pur&s;es of mo&s;t travellers will not allow them to game very high, it would be imprudent in a foreigner to engage too far in this diver&s;ion; e&s;pecially as the cards are different from what he has been u&s;ed to. None but noble Venetians hold the <HI>Banco,</HI> or bank, as it is called, in the Ridotto-room. Clo&s;e by every banker &s;it two ladies in ma&s;ks; who are allowed to put him in mind of any mi&s;takes he may chance to com|mit, to his di&s;advantage. The bankers are unma&s;ked; but the punters keep them on. No ma&s;k is denied
<PB N="254" REF="263">
admittance into the Ridotto-room; &s;o that it may be well conceived what inconveniences one mu&s;t &s;uffer from &s;uch a croud.</P>
<P>The grand &s;cene of all the follies acted, during the carnival, is St. Mark's place; where mountebanks, buffoons, and others, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is to make a prey of the &s;imple vulgar, have their &s;tages, and exhibit their &s;hows. But the mo&s;t ridiculous figures, among the re&s;t, are the old women, or old men, who &s;it upon a table, and are con&s;ulted, like oracles, con|cerning future events, the &s;ucce&s;s of enterprizes, &amp;c. That, among &s;uch a multitude of people, this may be done, without confu&s;ion, and with the greater &s;ecrecy, the&s;e fortune-tellers make u&s;e of a long &s;peaking-trumpet; through which the con&s;ulter conveys his queries by a whi&s;per; whil&s;t the conjurer conveys his ear to the large opening; and inverts the trumpet, to re&s;olve the que&s;tions propo&s;ed. Amid&s;t the pity which naturally mu&s;t ari&s;e in the human brea&s;t, at any in&s;tance of weakne&s;s, or wickedne&s;s, that deba&s;e ra|tional creatures; a per&s;on can &s;carce forbear &s;miling to &s;ee poor &s;imple girls, coming up to the&s;e fortune-tellers, who&s;e looks and ge&s;tures betray their fear and confu&s;ion, to enquire about their fate, with regard to their amours, &amp;c. To rai&s;e the higher ideas of their abilities, the&s;e impo&s;tors are &s;ure to place on their table &s;ome paltry globes, or other a&s;tronomical in&s;tru|ments.
<PB N="255" REF="264">
Even eccle&s;ia&s;tics, both regular and &s;ecular, have been known, openly, to have recour&s;e to the&s;e fortune-tellers.</P>
<P>In the colonade, or cloi&s;ter, round St Mark's place, are &s;everal coffee-hou&s;es, as we have before ob&s;erved; but which are frequented mo&s;tly by foreigners. For|merly the company u&s;ed to fit and conver&s;e together at their ea&s;e, in the&s;e coffee-hou&s;es; but this cu&s;tom has been, for &s;ome time, prohibited. This was owing to a di&s;covery made during the carnival. The &s;on of the Imperial envoy had made u&s;e of this opportunity, when masked, to di&s;cour&s;e with &s;everal of the Vene|tian nobility; and, &s;ince that time, no benches or chairs have been allowed in the coffee-hou&s;es of this city.</P>
<P>It is not only during the carnival, but on &s;everal other occa&s;ions, that masks are allowed; namely, on the four days that the republic holds its grand fea&s;ts; at the <HI>Regata,</HI> or boat-races, and other entertainments for the diver&s;ion of foreign princes; at the nuptials of one of the nobles; on the election of the procurators of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> or on the public entry of a foreign am|ba&s;&s;ador, &amp;c. The&s;e opportunities, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> the Venetian ladies wait for with the mo&s;t eager impati|ence; but the hu&s;bands are no le&s;s on their guard to &s;ecure the honour of the marriage-bed. However,
<PB N="256" REF="265">
as the commerce between the &s;exes has undergone great alterations, &s;ince the beginning of this century, this is al&s;o the ca&s;e at Venice; where ladies of cha|racter not only receive male vi&s;itors in the morning, when in an undre&s;s, but accept of invitations to enter|tainments, in mixed companies; and even to treats at taverns. But there are parties where foreigners are &s;eldom, or ever, admitted; unle&s;s known to &s;ome of the principal per&s;ons of the company.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t Thur&s;day of the carnival, when licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s is carried to its greate&s;t height, bulls are baited in &s;everal &s;treets, and in St. Mark's place; but the&s;e may be &s;een at other times.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h &s;ailor gave no bad account of a car|nival, when he told his Mahometan friends, on his re|turn to Turkey, that the poor chri&s;tians were all di&s;|ordered in their &s;en&s;es; and nearly in a &s;tate of actual madne&s;s, while he remained among them; till one day, on a &s;udden, they luckly found out a certain grey powder that cured &s;uch &s;ymptoms; and, laying it on their heads one Wedne&s;day morning, the wits of all the inhabitants were re&s;tored in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; and the people grew &s;ober, quiet, compo&s;ed, and went about their bu&s;ine&s;s, ju&s;t like other folks, He meant the a&s;hes &s;trewed on the heads of Catholics during Lent,

<P>On A&s;cen&s;ion-day, in the afternoon, &s;everal hun|dred boats and gondolas may be &s;een rowing, for wagers, on the canal <HI>di Murano;</HI> and their dexterity in keeping clear of each other, tacking about, &amp;c. is very &s;urprizing. In mo&s;t of the gondolas, on this day, are ma&s;ks and mu&s;ic; and a univer&s;al emulation appears among them, who &s;hall divert them&s;elves mo&s;t.</P>
<P>When any foreign prince of di&s;tinction arrives at Venice, the republic generally entertains him with a <HI>regatta,</HI> or rowing matches of gondolas, on the great canal. The word <HI>regatta</HI> &s;eems to be derived from the <HI>aurigatio,</HI> or chariot-races of the <HI>Circen&s;ian</HI> games.</P>
<P>Formerly another diver&s;ion was exhibited at this &s;ea&s;on, on a bridge near St. <HI>Barnaby</HI>'s church; which was an engagement betwixt the <HI>Ca&s;tellani</HI> and <HI>Nicolati.</HI> During this mock battle, &s;everal per&s;ons, on both &s;ides, are thrown into the water. This bridge is &s;even common paces broad, eighteen long, and without any fence; and, when &s;uch an engage|ment was going to be exhibited, the water under it was made deeper than u&s;ual. The combatants were not allowed to &s;cratch or &s;eize one another, but only to &s;hew their &s;trength, and addre&s;s, with their
<PB N="258" REF="267">
arms and fi&s;ts. But this diver&s;ion has been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time, having once occa&s;ioned a dangerous tumult; when the populace a&s;&s;aulted, with &s;tones, the hou&s;es where the nobles were po&s;ted to view the battle, and encourage the combatants.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal &s;hows, that are annually ex|hibited during the carnival, <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> mentions one that is odd enough, and particular to the Venetians. A &s;et of arti&s;ans, by the &s;everal poles, which they lay acro&s;s each others &s;houlders, build them&s;elves up into a kind of pyramid; &s;o that you &s;ee a pile of men, in the air, of four or five rows, ri&s;ing one above another. The weight is &s;o equally di&s;tributed, that every man is very well able to bear his part of it; the &s;tories, if they may be &s;o called, growing le&s;s and le&s;s as they advance higher and higher. A little boy repre&s;ents the point of the pyramid; who, after a &s;hort &s;pace, leaps off, with a great deal of dexterity, into the arms of one that catches him at the bottom. In the &s;ame manner the whole building falls to pieces. (We have &s;een this exhibited at a place of entertainment in London). I have been the more particular in this, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e it explains the following ver&s;e of <HI>Claudian,</HI> which &s;hews that the Venetians are not the inventors of this trick.</P>

<P>The Italian plays, in general, remarks <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> are wretched performances, and tho&s;e of Venice are not at all better than the re&s;t. As the whole de&s;ign of the actors is to rai&s;e a laugh in the audience, to that pur|po&s;e they employ all manner of grimaces, po&s;tures, and di&s;tortions, which &s;ometimes border upon ob|&s;cenity.</P>
<P>The Italian opera may be very ju&s;tly reckoned among the principal diver&s;ions, both of the carnival and the A&s;cen&s;ion week. In this particular, the Ita|lians unque&s;tionably &s;urpa&s;s all other nations; and nothing but an in&s;upportable vanity can make the French bring their mu&s;ic in competition with that of Italy. The decorations of the theatre of Paris are indeed &s;carce to be exceeded, and the dances and in|terludes, between the acts, are excellent. But in the
<PB N="260" REF="269">
compo&s;ition of the opera, and the executive part, the French are much inferior to the Italians. Their airs, for the mo&s;t part, re&s;emble drinking &s;ongs, and have &s;o little variety, that the repetition of the &s;ame &s;ounds mu&s;t be tire&s;ome to a nice car. When a new opera is exhibited, if the French audience cannot make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the airs, &s;o as to be able to join with the performers, in &s;inging them on the &s;econd night, they are di&s;plea&s;ed with them. But in the Ita|lian theatre the ca&s;e is different; for though the latter have naturally a great fondne&s;s and genius for mu&s;ic; yet they are &s;en&s;ible it requires a much longer time to be able to imitate the fine airs of their &s;ingers.</P>
<P>Interludes, which con&s;i&s;t of drolleries of all kinds, accompanied with &s;uitable &s;ongs, are introduced be|tween the acts of the opera, on the Italian &s;tage, in order to divert the audience. Ballads and dances are al&s;o frequently exhibited, but the&s;e are not to be compared with the opera dances at Paris.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than &s;even <HI>theatres</HI> at Venice; two of the&s;e are commonly appropriated to the &s;erious operas, two to comic operas, and the other three to plays; but they are all open only during the carnival, which begins on St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and continues till Lent; and then they are all full every night. In Autumn, the hou&s;es are open for the comic operas and plays:
<PB N="261" REF="270">
and at the A&s;cen&s;ion there is a &s;erious opera. A trifle is paid at the door for admittance; this entitles a per&s;on to go into the pit, where he may look about, and determine what part of the hou&s;e he will &s;it in. There are rows of chairs towards the front, the &s;eats of which &s;old back, and are locked. Tho&s;e, who choo&s;e to occupy them, pay a little more money to the door-keeper, who immediately unlocks the &s;eat. Very decent people occupy the&s;e chairs; but the back part of the pit is filled with footmen and gondoliers, in their common working clothes. The nobility, and better &s;ort of citizens, have boxes re|tained for the year; but there is always a &s;ufficient number to be let to &s;trangers; the price of them varies every night, according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the piece to be acted.</P>
<P>A Venetian playhou&s;e has a di&s;mal appearance, in the eyes of people accu&s;tomed to the brilliancy of tho&s;e in London. Many of the boxes are &s;o dark, that the faces of the company in them can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed, at a little di&s;tance; even when they do not wear masks. The &s;tage, however, is well il|luminated, &s;o that the people in the boxes can &s;ee perfectly well, every thing that is tran&s;acted there; and when they chu&s;e to be &s;een them&s;elves, they order lights into the boxes. Between the acts, ladies may &s;ometimes be &s;een walking about with their <HI>cavalieri
<PB N="262" REF="271">
&s;erventi</HI> in the back part of the pit, when it is not crowded. As they are masked, they do not &s;cruple to reconnoitre the company with their &s;pying-gla&s;&s;es, from this place: when the play begins they return to their boxes. This continual moving about, from box to box, and between the boxes and the pit, mu&s;t create &s;ome confu&s;ion; and, no doubt, is di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e who attend merely on account of the piece. There mu&s;t be found &s;ome <HI>douceur,</HI> at lea&s;t, in the mid&s;t of all this ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion; which, in the opinion of the majority of the audience, overbalances the&s;e inconveniences.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic of the opera, here, is reckoned as fine as in any town in Italy. The dramatic and poetic part of the&s;e pieces is little regarded, provided the mu&s;ic receives the approbation of the critics. It is certainly happy for a man to have a ta&s;te for fine mu&s;ic, be|cau&s;e he has, by this means, one &s;ource of enjoyment more than tho&s;e, who&s;e auditory nerves are le&s;s deli|cately &s;trung. It is, however, equally ab&s;urd, to affect an exce&s;&s;ive delight in things, which nature has not framed us to enjoy; yet how many people may be &s;een doing painful penance in the opera-hou&s;e, at the Haymarket; and, in the mid&s;t of un&s;uppre&s;&s;ible yawnings, calling out, Charming! exqui&s;ite! bra|vi&s;&s;imo! &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="272">It is amazing what pains &s;ome people take to render them&s;elves ridiculous; and it is a matter of real curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve, in what various &s;hapes the little de&s;picable &s;pirit of affectation &s;hews it&s;elf among mankind.</P>
<P>I remember, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> a very hone&s;t gentle|man, who under&s;tood little or no French; but having picked up a few phra&s;es, he brought them forward on every occa&s;ion; and affected, among his neighbours in the country, the mo&s;t perfect knowledge, and the highe&s;t admiration of that language. When any per&s;on, in compliance with his ta&s;te, uttered a &s;entence in that tongue, though my good friend did not under|&s;tand a &s;yllable of it, yet he never failed to nod and &s;mile to the &s;peaker, with the mo&s;t knowing air ima|ginable. The par&s;on of the pari&s;h, at a country dinner, once addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e emphatic words: <HI>Mon&s;ieur, Je trouve ce plum pudding extr&eacute;mement bon!</HI> which happening not to be in my friends collection of phra&s;es, he did not comprehend. He nodded and &s;miled to the clergyman, however, in his u&s;ual intelli|gent manner; but a per&s;on who &s;at near him, being &s;truck with the &s;agacious and important tone in which the ob&s;ervation had been delivered, begged of my friend to explain it in Engli&s;h: on which, after &s;ome he&s;i|tation, he declared that the turn of the expre&s;&s;ion was &s;o genteel, and &s;o exqui&s;itely adapted to the French idiom, that it could not be rendered into Engli&s;h
<PB N="264" REF="273">
without lo&s;ing a great deal of the original beauty of the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>At the comic opera, continues <HI>Moore,</HI> I have &s;ometimes &s;een action alone excite the highe&s;t ap|plau&s;e, independent either of the poetry or the mu&s;ic. I &s;aw a duo performed by an old man and a young woman, &s;uppo&s;ed to be his daughter, in &s;uch a hu|mourous manner, as drew an univer&s;al encore from the &s;pectators; though the merit of the mu&s;ical part of the compo&s;ition was but very moderate.</P>
<P>The father informs his daughter, in a &s;ong, he had found an excellent match for her; who, be&s;ides being rich, very prudent, and not too young, was, a particular friend of his own; and, in per&s;on and di&s;|po&s;ition, not unlike him&s;elf: he concludes by telling her the ceremony &s;hall be performed next day. She thanks him in the gaye&s;t air po&s;&s;ible, for his obliging intentions, adding, that &s;he &s;hould have been glad to have &s;hewn her implicit obedience to his com|mands, had there been any chance of the man's being to her ta&s;te; but as, from the account given, there could be none, &s;he declares &s;he will not marry him the next day; and adds, with a very <HI>long</HI> quaver, that if &s;he were to live to <HI>all eternity,</HI> &s;he &s;hould con|tinue of the &s;ame opinion. The father, in a violent rage, tells her, in&s;tead of to-morrow, the marriage &s;hall take place that very day; to which &s;he replies,
<PB N="265" REF="274">
<HI>non:</HI> he rejoins, <HI>&s;i;</HI> &s;he, <HI>non, non;</HI> he, <HI>&s;i, &s;i;</HI> the daughter, <HI>non, non, non;</HI> the father, <HI>&s;i, &s;i, &s;i;</HI> and &s;o the &s;inging continued five or &s;ix minutes. There is certainly nothing marvellou&s;ly witty in this; and for a daughter to be of a different opinion from her father, in the choice of a hu&s;band, is not a very new dramatic incident. The duo, however, was encored, and performed a &s;econd time with more humour than the fir&s;t. The whole hou&s;e vociferates for it again; and it was &s;ung a third time in a manner equally plea|&s;ant, and yet perfectly different from any of the former two. I thought the hou&s;e would have been brought down about our ears, &s;o extravagant were the te&s;timonies of approbation. The two actors were now obliged to appear again, and &s;ing this duo a fourth time; which they executed in a &s;tyle &s;o new, &s;o natural, and &s;o exqui&s;itely droll, that the audi|ence now thought there had been &s;omething deficient in all their former performances, and that they had hit on the true comic only this la&s;t time. Some people began to call for it again; but the old man, now quite exhau&s;ted, begged for mercy; on which the point was given up. I never before, concludes <HI>Moore,</HI> had any idea, that &s;uch &s;trong comic powers could have been di&s;played in the warbling of a &s;ong.</P>
<P>The dancing is an e&s;&s;ential part of the entertain|ment at the opera here, as well as at London.
<PB N="266" REF="275">
There is certainly a much greater proportion of man|kind deaf to the delights of mu&s;ic, than blind to the beauties of fine dancing. During the &s;inging and recitative, the fingers often &s;ing, for a con&s;iderable time, without any one's minding them; but the mo|ment the ballet begins, private conver&s;ation, though pretty univer&s;al before, is immediately at an end, and the eyes of all the &s;pectators are fixed on the &s;tage. This, to be &s;ure, has always been the ca&s;e in London; and, in &s;pite of the pains &s;ome people take to conceal it, we all know the rea&s;on; but to find this &s;ame preference of dancing to mu&s;ic, in Italy, is worthy of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The comedies, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> that I &s;aw at Venice, or indeed in any other part of Italy, are very dif|ferent, and more lewd than tho&s;e of other countries. Their poets have no notion of genteel comedy, and fall into the mo&s;t filthy double meanings imaginable, when they have a mind to make their audience merry. There is no part generally &s;o wretched as that of the fine gentleman, e&s;pecially when he conver&s;es with his mi&s;tre&s;s; for then the whole dialogue is an in&s;ipid mixture of pedantry and romance. But it is no wonder that the poets of &s;o jealous and re&s;erved a nation fail in &s;uch conver&s;ation on the &s;tage, which they have no patterns of in nature. There are four &s;tanding characters, which enter into every piece that come on the &s;tage, the <HI>Doctor,
<PB N="267" REF="276">
Harlequin, Pantalone,</HI> and <HI>Coviello.</HI> The doctor's character comprehends the whole extent of a pedant, that with a deep voice, and a magi&s;terial air, breaks in upon conver&s;ation, and drives down all before him: every thing he &s;ays is backed with quo|tations out of <HI>Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Virgil,</HI> or any author that ri&s;es uppermo&s;t; and all an&s;wers from his companion are looked upon as impertinences or in|terruptions. <HI>Harlequin</HI>'s part is made up of blunders and ab&s;urdities: he is to mi&s;take one man for another, to forget his errands, to &s;tumble over queens, and to run his head again&s;t a po&s;t that &s;tands in his way. This all attended with &s;omething &s;o comical in the voice and ge&s;tures, that a man, who is &s;en&s;ible of the folly of the part, can hardly forbear being plea&s;ed with it. <HI>Pantalone</HI> is generally an old cully, and <HI>Coviello</HI> a &s;harper.</P>
<P><HI>Moore</HI> makes the &s;ame remarks. I had got, &s;ays this writer, I don't know how, the mo&s;t contemptuous opinion of the Italian drama. I had been told there was not a tolerable actor in Italy, and had been long taught to con&s;ider their comedy as the mo&s;t de&s;picable &s;tuff in the world, which could not amu&s;e, or even draw a &s;mile from, any per&s;on of ta&s;te. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, I vi&s;ited one of the playhou&s;es in this city. The piece was a comedy, and the mo&s;t entertaining character in it, was that of a man who
<PB N="268" REF="277">
&s;tuttered. In this defect, and in the &s;ingular gri|maces which accompanied it, con&s;i&s;ted a great part of the amu&s;ement. Di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;uch a pitiful &s;ub|&s;titution for wit and humour, I expre&s;&s;ed a contempt for an audience which could be entertained with &s;uch buffoonery, and who could take plea&s;ure in a na|tural infirmity. While we inwardly indulged &s;enti|ments of &s;elf-approbation, on account of the refine|ment and &s;uperiority of our ta&s;te, and &s;upported the dignity of tho&s;e &s;entiments by a di&s;dainful gravity of countenance; the &s;tutterer was giving a piece of in|formation to <HI>Harlequin,</HI> which greatly intere&s;ted him, and to which he li&s;tened with every mark of eager|ne&s;s. The unfortunate &s;peaker had ju&s;t arrived at the mo&s;t important part of his narrative, which was to acquaint the impatient li&s;tener where his mi&s;tre&s;s was concealed, when he unluckily &s;tumbled on a word of &s;ix or &s;even &s;yllables, which completely ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of his narration. He attempted it again and again, but always without &s;ucce&s;s. You may have ob&s;erved, that though many other words would explain his meaning equally well, you may as &s;oon make a &s;aint change his religion, as prevail on a &s;tut|terer to accept of another word in place of the one at which he has &s;tumbled. He adheres to his fir&s;t word to the la&s;t, and will &s;ooner expire with it in his throat, than give it up for any other you may offer. <HI>Harle|quin,</HI> on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, pre&s;ented his friend
<PB N="269" REF="278">
with a dozen, but he rejected them all with di&s;dain, and per&s;i&s;ted in his un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts on that which had fir&s;t come in his way. At length, making a de&s;perate effort, when all the &s;pectators were gaping in expectation of his &s;afe delivery, the cruel word came up with its broad &s;ide foremo&s;t, and &s;tuck directly acro&s;s the unhappy man's windpipe. He gaped, and panted, and croaked; his face flu&s;hed, and his eyes &s;eemed ready to &s;tart from his head. <HI>Harlequin</HI> unbuttoned the &s;tutterers wai&s;tcoat, and the neck of his &s;hirt; he fanned his face with his cap, and held a bottle of hart&s;horn to his no&s;e. At length, fearing his unhappy patient would expire before he could give the de&s;ired intelligence, in a fit of de&s;pair he pitched his head full in the dying man's &s;tomach, and the word bolted out at his mouth to the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e. This was performed in a manner &s;o perfectly droll, and the humorous ab&s;ur|dity of the expedient came &s;o unexpectedly upon me, that I immediately bur&s;t into a mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive fit of laughter, in which I was accompanied by the friends who were with me; and our laughter continued in &s;uch loud, violent, and repeated fits, that the at|tention of the audience being turned from the &s;tage to our box, occa&s;ioned a renewal of the mirth all over the playhou&s;e with greater vociferation than at fir&s;t. On return to our hotel, I was a&s;ked if I were as much convinced as ever, that a man mu&s;t be perfectly de|void
<PB N="270" REF="279">
of ta&s;te, who could conde&s;cend to laugh at an Italian comedy. When the theatres are open, all the world goes there, particularly in the &s;ea&s;on of the carnival, where the Barcaroles, or Gondoliers, make &s;o great a figure, that it is &s;aid of them, what <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> &s;aid of the trunk-maker in the <HI>Tatler,</HI> that what they cen&s;ure or applaud is generally condemned or approved by the public; in &s;hort, that it is the Barcaroles who decide the fate of an opera or play. The&s;e Barcaroles, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> are certainly &s;uch a body of &s;ober men, as in England we have no in&s;tance of, among the lower cla&s;s of people: in ma&s;querade time, however, they indulge the ta&s;te of gaming; and, doubtle&s;s, often play with the nobles, their ma&s;ters; but the brownne&s;s and coar&s;ene&s;s of their hands be|tray their occupation; be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to forbear making their boa&s;ts, or their com|plaints, of good and bad fortune; when their dialect and deportment never fail to di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>The number, as well as character of the&s;e people, renders their body very re&s;pectable: when one con|&s;iders that in all the great families every gentleman keeps a di&s;tinct gondola, rowed by two men, except &s;ome few, who have but one rower; it will be readily conceived, that the number of Barcaroles mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable. They are exceedingly proud of their &s;tation, and with &s;ome rea&s;on; for their pro|fe&s;&s;ion

leads them into the company of the greate&s;t men of the &s;tate; and it is the fa&s;hion to conver&s;e with them, to hear their wit and humour, and applaud every thing they &s;ay; be&s;ides, the pay of a Barcarole is about eighteen pence Engli&s;h, with liveries and little perqui&s;ites; which, in &s;o cheap a country, is a plentiful income to a &s;ober man; accordingly it is notorious, that all of them can afford to marry, and do marry.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this account of their amu&s;e|ments with the ceremony of a Venetian wedding, and the dre&s;s of the bride, as de&s;cribed by Lady <HI>Millar.</HI> The proce&s;&s;ion of the gondolas to the church was very fine; the gondoliers, dre&s;&s;ed in gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, made a mo&s;t brilliant contra&s;t with the black|ne&s;s of their boats. The pillars, and walls of the church, were covered with crim&s;on dama&s;k, fringed with gold; the altar richly adorned with lace and flowers, and the &s;teps up to it &s;pread over with Per|&s;ian carpets; and the whole church was illuminated with large wax tapers, though at noon day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the company were di&s;embarked from their gondolas, they formed them&s;elves into a regular proce&s;&s;ion; the ladies walked two and two: they were all dre&s;&s;ed in thin black &s;ilk gowns, (except the bride) with large hoops; the gowns are &s;trait-bodied, with
<PB N="272" REF="281">
very long trains, like the court-dre&s;&s;es worn at Ver|&s;ailles; their trains tucked up on one &s;ide of the hoop, with a prodigious large ta&s;&s;el of diamonds. Their &s;leeves were covered, up to the &s;houlders, with falls of the fine&s;t Bru&s;&s;els lace, a drawn tucker of the &s;ame round the bo&s;om, adorned with rows of the fine&s;t pearl, each as large as a moderate goo&s;eberry, till the rows de&s;cended below the top of the &s;tomacher; then two ropes of pearls, which came from the back of the neck, were caught up, at the left &s;ide of the &s;tomacher, and fini&s;hed in two fine ta&s;&s;els. Their heads were dre&s;&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly high, in a va&s;t number of buckles, and two long drop curls in the neck. A great num|ber of diamond pins, and &s;trings of pearl, adorned their heads, with large <HI>&s;ultanes,</HI> or feathers, on one &s;ide, and magnificent diamond ear-rings.</P>
<P>The bride was dre&s;&s;ed in cloth of &s;ilver, made in the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and decorated in the &s;ame manner, with the other ladies; but her bo&s;om was quite bare, and &s;he had a fine diamond neck-lace, and an enor|mous <HI>bouquet</HI> of natural flowers. Her hair was dre&s;&s;ed as high as the others, with this difference, that it was in curls behind as well as before; the&s;e curls had a &s;ingular appearance, but not near &s;o good an effect as the heads of the other ladies, who&s;e hair was plaited in large folds, and appeared much more graceful: her diamonds were very fine, and in great

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Con&s;titution and Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;upreme authority is lodged in the hands of the nobility, who are &s;aid to be in number near 2,000. On the birth of a nobleman's &s;on, his name is entered in the <HI>golden book,</HI> otherwi&s;e he forfeits his nobility. Every nobleman is indeed a member of the &s;enate; and, on this account, it is a received maxim that they are all equal in dignity. But the difference, notwith&s;tanding, between the intere&s;t and
<PB N="274" REF="284">
authority of families, is very con&s;iderable. Crowned heads, German, and other princes, have not thought it any degradation to be made nobles of Venice.</P>
<P>The head of the Republic is the Doge, or Duke; who, on the demi&s;e of the former, is cho&s;en in the fol|lowing manner; which is not a little complicated. All the noblemen, above thirty years of age, meet in the palace of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> where an equal number of balls, to the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, are put into an urn. Thirty of the&s;e are gilded, and the others &s;ilvered over. Every nobleman, in his turn, takes out a balls, and they who have drawn the thirty gilt balls, retire into a chamber to continue the election. The&s;e thirty electors draw from another urn, in which are twenty-one &s;ilvered, and nine gilded balls. They who draw the gilded balls, nominate forty other electors, which are again by lot reduced to twelve, who name five and twenty. The&s;e five and twenty draw lots a &s;econd time, to be reduced to nine, and of the&s;e nine, each choo&s;es five others, making in all forty-five; and from the&s;e forty-five, eleven are &s;e|parated again by lot, who choo&s;e forty-one others. The&s;e forty-one are then &s;hut up in a chamber of the ducal palace, and there remain till they have cho&s;en a new Doge. The re&s;ult of their determination is generally known in &s;ix or eight hours. To the due and legal election of a Doge, it is required, that out
<PB N="275" REF="285">
of the forty-one, he &s;hould have five and twenty votes. His election is followed by a kind of coro|nation; the ducal cap, the fore-part of which pro|jects as a mark of the unlimited power of the re|public, being placed, with great ceremony, on his head.</P>
<P>The Doge has been very ju&s;tly defined to be, in habit and &s;tate a king, in authority a coun&s;ellor, in the city a pri&s;oner, and out of it a private per&s;on. He is not &s;o much as to &s;tir from the city, without the council's permi&s;&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, his privileges con&s;i&s;t in the following leading particulars: 1. That the coin be &s;tamped with his name, but not with his image. 2. That all the credentials of the mini&s;ters of the repub|lics to foreign courts be made out in his name, but with|out his &s;ignature, or &s;eal. 3. That all di&s;patches from foreign courts be directed to him; which, however, he is not to open, but in pre&s;ence of &s;ome of the council. 4. That he is to act as the pre&s;ident of all a&s;&s;emblies. 5. That within Venice he is to have the &s;tate of a &s;overeign prince, and to be &s;tyled <HI>Sereni&s;|&s;ime.</HI> 6. That he is to uncover him&s;elf only before &s;overeigns, and princes of royal blood, and cardinals. 7. La&s;tly, That his family is not to be &s;ubject to any &s;umptuary laws. His yearly income is 12,000 ducats. Of this &s;um, he mu&s;t &s;pend one half on the four grand entertainments, which he is obliged to
<PB N="276" REF="286">
give every year; and, to live up to his dignity, he mu&s;t al&s;o &s;pend con&s;iderably of his own fortune.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;trictions laid upon him, are the fol|lowing: His &s;ons and brothers are excluded from all con&s;iderable offices, and incapable of being &s;ent on emba&s;&s;ies as long as he lives; and, without the &s;enate's con&s;ent, they are not to accept of a fief from a foreign prince, or a benefice from the Pope. Even the Doge him&s;elf is not to marry the &s;i&s;ter, or re|lation of a prince, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the great council. On his demi&s;e, his admini&s;tration is &s;trictly enquired into, and frequent opportunities taken of laying a heavy fine on his heirs for mal-admini&s;tra|tion. Even in his life-time, he is &s;ubject to the de|cree of the &s;tate inqui&s;ition; the pre&s;ident of which may, at all hours, go into his mo&s;t &s;ecret clo&s;ets, and &s;earch his bed, and all his writings, while the Doge dares not expre&s;s the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t, or re&s;ent|ment. In &s;tate affairs, he cannot do the lea&s;t thing, nor go out of the city, without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate; and, during his &s;tay on the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> he is looked on no more than a private gentleman. Under &s;uch di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances, if it were not a flagrant truth, that the human heart idolizes every thing which has a &s;plendid exterior, we &s;hould conclude, that the dignity of a Venetian Doge, would be rather avoided, than eagerly &s;ought after.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="287">In the grand council, all nobles, of the age of twenty-five years, may take their place, though &s;ome younger find means to obtain admittance. It u&s;ually meets on Sundays, and holidays, in the large hall of the ducal place; and, when all the nobility are pre|&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of near 2,000 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, or <HI>pregadi,</HI> are a committee of the grand council, by whom they are al&s;o cho&s;en. This &s;enate has the management of the mo&s;t &s;ecret and important &s;tate affairs; &s;uch as making alliances, declaring war, &s;ending amba&s;&s;adors, coining money, &s;itting up offices, impo&s;ing taxes, &amp;c. It con&s;i&s;ts of about 300 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The third council is called the <HI>collegium,</HI> and con|&s;i&s;ts of the Doge, his &s;ix coun&s;ellors, and one or two others. In this council, letters and in&s;truments re|lating to the &s;tate are read, amba&s;&s;adors are ad|mitted to audience, and other important affairs are tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>The procurators of St. <HI>Mark</HI> were, at fir&s;t, only appointed as commi&s;&s;ioners, to &s;uperintend the build|ing of the church; but in time, wills, guardian&s;hips, and making a proper provi&s;ion for the poor, fell under their juri&s;diction. This office is reckoned the more con&s;iderable, becau&s;e it is held for life. The procu|rators
<PB N="278" REF="288">
of St. <HI>Mark</HI> are, at pre&s;ent; but nine in number: when the &s;tate is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for money, the title may be acquired, by advancing a con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>The council often is a high penal court, which, in fact, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eventeen members; for, be&s;ides the ten noblemen cho&s;en annually by the grand council, from which number this court receives its name, the Doge pre&s;ides, and the &s;ix coun&s;ellors attached to the Doge a&s;&s;i&s;t, when they think proper, at all deliberations.</P>
<P>The council is &s;upreme in all crimes again&s;t the &s;tate. It is the duty of three chiefs, cho&s;en every month from this court, by lot, to open all letters ad|dre&s;&s;ed to it; to report the contents, and a&s;&s;emble the members, when they think proper. They have the power of &s;eizing accu&s;ed per&s;ons, examining them in pri&s;on, and taking their an&s;wers in writing, with the evidence again&s;t them; which being laid before the court, the&s;e chiefs appear as pro&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners, all this time, are kept in clo&s;e con|finement, deprived of the company of relations and friends, and not allowed to receive any advice by letters. They can have no coun&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, un|le&s;s
<PB N="279" REF="289">
one of the judges choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ume that office; in which ca&s;e he is permitted to manage their defence, and plead their cau&s;e; after which the court decides, by a majority of votes, acquitting the pri&s;oner, or condemning him to private or public execution, as they think proper; and if any per&s;ons murmur at the fate of their relations or friends, and talk of their innocence, and the inju&s;tice they have met with, the&s;e mal-contents are in great danger of meeting with the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>Out of this court the grand council of Venice, in the year 1501, thought proper to create the tribunal of &s;tate-inqui&s;itors, which is &s;till more de&s;potic and brief in its manner of proceeding.</P>
<P>This court con&s;i&s;ts of three members only, all taken from the council of ten; two litterally from the ten, and the third from the coun&s;ellors of the Doge, who al&s;o make part of that council.</P>
<P>The&s;e three per&s;ons have the power of deciding, without appeal, on the lives of every citizen belong|ing to the Venetian State; the highe&s;t of the nobility, even the Doge him&s;elf, not being excepted. They keep the keys of the boxes, into which anonymous informations are thrown. The informers, who ex|pect a recompence, cut off a little piece of their letter,
<PB N="280" REF="290">
which they afterwards &s;hew to the inqui&s;itor, when they claim a reward. To the&s;e three inqui&s;itors is given the right of employing &s;pies, con&s;idering &s;ecret intelligence, i&s;&s;uing orders to &s;eize all per&s;ons, who&s;e words or actions they think reprehen&s;ible, and afterwards trying them, when they think proper. If all the three are of one opinion, no farther ceremony is nece&s;&s;ary; they may order the pri&s;oner to be &s;trangled in pri&s;on, drowned in the canal Orfano, hanged privately in the night between the pillars, or executed publickly as they plea&s;e; and whatever their deci&s;ion be, no further inqui&s;ition can be made on the &s;ubject; but, if any one of the three differs from his brethren, the cau&s;e mu&s;t be carried before the full a&s;&s;embly of the council often. One would naturally imagine, that by tho&s;e the pri&s;oner might have a good chance of being acquitted; becau&s;e, the difference in opinion of the three inqui&s;itors &s;hews, that the ca&s;e is at lea&s;t dubious; and, in du|bious ca&s;es, this court is governed by maxims dif|ferent from that of others. It is a rule here to admit of &s;maller pre&s;umptions, in all crimes which affect the government, than in other ca&s;es; and the only dif|ference they make between a crime fully proved, and one more doubtful, is, that, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the execution is in broad day-light; but when there are doubts of the pri&s;oner's guilt, he is put to death pri|vately. The &s;tate inqui&s;itors have keys to every
<PB N="281" REF="291">
apartment of the ducal palace, and can, when they think proper, penetrate into the very bed-chamber of the Doge, open his cabinet, and examine his papers. Of cour&s;e they may command acce&s;s to the hou&s;e of every individual in the &s;tate. They con|tinue in office only one year, but are not re&s;pon&s;ible afterwards for their conduct, while they were in au|thority.</P>
<P>What would our modern patriots think, if they lived in the &s;ame city with three per&s;ons, who had the power of &s;hutting them up in a dungeon, and putting them to death when they plea&s;ed, and with|out being accountable for &s;o doing? If, from the characters of the inqui&s;itors of one year, a man had nothing to dread; &s;till he might fear, that a &s;et of a different character might be in authority the next; and although he were per&s;uaded, that the inqui&s;itors would always be cho&s;en from among men of the mo&s;t known integrity in the &s;tate, he might tremble at the malice of &s;ecret informers and enemies; a combi|nation of whom might impo&s;e on the under&s;tanding of upright judges, e&s;pecially where the accu&s;ed is ex|cluded from his friends, and denied coun&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his defence; for let him be never &s;o con&s;cious of innocence, he cannot be &s;ure of remaining un&s;u&s;|pected, or unaccu&s;ed; nor can he be certain, that he &s;hall not be put to the rack, to &s;upply a deficiency of
<PB N="282" REF="292">
evidence; and finally, though a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much firmne&s;s of character, as to feel no inquietude from any of their con&s;iderations on his own account, he might &s;till be under apprehen&s;ions for his children, and other connections, for whom &s;ome men feel more anxiety than for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If a nobleman declines an office to which he has been elected, he is obliged to pay a fine of 2,000 ducats, and is excluded from the great council, and likewi&s;e from the <HI>Broglio,</HI> for the &s;pace of two years. The <HI>nobili</HI> are not allowed to hold any lands or fiefs on the <HI>terra firma;</HI> but gardens and hou&s;es of plea|&s;ure are not included in this prohibition. A noble Venetian, who enters into holy orders, is excluded from the great council, and all public employments; and this law extends even to &s;uch as are made knights of Malta. None of the nobility mu&s;t take pre&s;ents, pen&s;ions, or receive any order of knighthood from foreign &s;tates. The relations of &s;uch Venetians, as are cardinals, are excluded from all deliberations in the council, re&s;pecting eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. No per&s;on enjoys more than one office at the &s;ame time, be it ever &s;o con&s;iderable. No one mu&s;t congratulate any per&s;on, in his obtaining a part in the govern|ment, except he is promoted to be Doge or Procu|rator of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> nor mu&s;t he &s;olicit any judge, but on criminal proce&s;&s;es. In the divi&s;ion of hereditary
<PB N="283" REF="293">
e&s;tates, the elde&s;t &s;on of a noble Venetian has no ad|vantage over his younger brothers; by which means &s;everal families are reduced to poverty; e&s;pecially as they are not allowed to mend their circum&s;tances by trade or commerce. It is hardly credible, what a mean appearance &s;everal per&s;ons among the nobility make in the &s;treets of Venice, by the &s;habbine&s;s of their dre&s;s, &amp;c. Many of them are not able to keep a &s;ervant; &s;o that they are obliged to buy their provi&s;ions, even in the market, and carry them home along the public &s;treets. When there are &s;everal brothers in a family, in order to prevent their falling thus into contempt by their poverty, only one of them marries. But by this practice, not only the increa&s;e of the nobility is hindered, but a great many &s;canda|lous cries are likewi&s;e propagated among the re&s;t of the brothers, which are committed at Venice in a mo&s;t flagrant manner, without &s;hame or concealment. Keeping a mi&s;tre&s;s is looked upon as an undoubted privilege belonging to a noble Venetian; and when one, by rea&s;on of his poverty, cannot keep a mi&s;tre&s;s for his own u&s;e alone, he enters into a co-partner&s;hip with three or four indigent per&s;ons, who all con|tribute to &s;upport her, and enjoy her company by turns.</P>
<P>Many people are &s;urprized, that in a government &s;o very jealous of its power as that of Venice, there
<PB N="284" REF="294">
is no military e&s;tabli&s;hment, within the city, to &s;upport the executive power, and repre&s;s any popular com|motion. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the jea|lou&s;y of the government, le&s;t a few rich and powerful nobles &s;hould corrupt the garri&s;on, and gain over the commander to any ambitious plan of their own, for the de&s;truction of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But although there is no formal garri&s;on, in a military uniform, there is a real effective force, &s;uf|ficient to &s;uppre&s;s any popular commotion, at the command of the &s;enate and council of ten. This force, be&s;ides the <HI>Sbirri,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of &s;tout fellows; who, without any di&s;tingui&s;hing dre&s;s, are kept in the pay of government, and are at the command of that council. There is al&s;o the whole body of the Gondoliers, the mo&s;t hardy and daring of the common Venetians. This body of men are greatly attached to the nobility, from whom they have mo&s;t of their employment, and with whom they ac|quire a certain degree of familiarity, by pa&s;&s;ing great part of their time, &s;hut up in boats, in their company, and by being privy to many of their love intrigues. Great numbers of the&s;e Gondoliers are in the &s;ervice of particular nobles; and there is no doubt that, in ca&s;e of any popular in&s;urrection, the whole would take the &s;ide of the nobility and &s;enate, again&s;t the people. In &s;hort, they may be con&s;idered as a kind of &s;tanding
<PB N="285" REF="295">
militia, ready to ri&s;e as &s;oon as the government re|quired their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there is the Grand Council it&s;elf; which, in ca&s;e of any violent commotion of the citizens and populace, could be armed directly, from the &s;mall ar&s;enal within the ducal palace; and would prove a very formidable force again&s;t an unarmed multitude; for the laws of Venice forbid, under pain of death, any citizen to carry fire-arms; a law which is very exactly executed by the &s;tate inqui&s;itors.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, the executive power of govern|ment is as irre&s;i&s;tible at Venice, as at Peter&s;burgh, or Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>There is, unque&s;tionably, much reflection and great depth of thought, in the formation of the political con&s;titution of Venice; but, remark &s;ome writers, it would be more admirable, if the council of ten, and &s;tate inqui&s;itors, had never formed any part of it. This in&s;titution, &s;ay they, de&s;troys the effect of all the re&s;t, and is wor&s;e than the fixed and permanent tyranny of one per&s;on; for that per&s;on's character, and maxims would be known; and, by endeavouring to conform them&s;elves to his way of thinking, people might have &s;ome chance of living unmole&s;ted; but, according to this plan, they have a free-thinker for
<PB N="286" REF="296">
their tyrant to-day, and a bigot to morrow. One year a &s;et of inqui&s;itors, who con&s;ider certain parts of conduct as innocent; which, in the &s;ight of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, may appear &s;tate-crimes; &s;o that men know not what they have to depend on. A uni|ver&s;al jealou&s;y mu&s;t therefore prevail, and pre|cautions will be u&s;ed to avoid the &s;u&s;picions of go|vernment, unknown in any other country. Ac|cordingly, we find, that the noble Venetians are afraid of having any intercour&s;e with foreign Am|ba&s;&s;adors, or with foreigners of any kind; they are even cautious of vi&s;iting at each others hou&s;es, and hardly ever have meetings together, except at the courts, or in the Broglio. The boa&s;ted &s;ecrecy of their public councils proceeds, in all probability, from the &s;ame principle of fear. If all conver&s;ation on public affairs were forbid, under pain of death, and if the members of the Briti&s;h parliament were liable to be &s;eized in the night, by general warrants, and hanged at Tyburn, or drowned in the Thames, at the plea&s;ure of the Secretaries of State, the world would know as little of what pa&s;&s;es in either hou&s;e of parliament, as they do of what is tran&s;acted in the &s;enate of Venice.</P>
<P>It is not &s;afe for a noble Venetian to acquire, in a high degree, the love and confidence of the common people. This excites the jealou&s;y of the inqui&s;itors,
<PB N="287" REF="297">
and proves a pretty certain means of excluding him from any of the high offices. A government which di&s;plays &s;o much di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion, when there is little or no ground, will not fail to &s;hew marks of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, when, in the general opinion, there is &s;ome rea&s;on to be circum&s;pect.</P>
<P>Though it is forbid the nobility and clergy, to hold any communication with &s;trangers upon politics, or affairs of &s;tate; yet, it is remarked, that the Gondoliers are exceeding ready to talk upon the&s;e, or any other &s;ubjects, with all who give them the &s;malle&s;t en|couragement. Tho&s;e, who are not in the immediate &s;ervice of any particular nobleman, are often retained by government, as &s;pies upon &s;trangers. It is &s;aid, that while the&s;e fellows row their gondolas, in &s;eeming inattention to the conver&s;ation, they are taking notice of every thing which is &s;aid, that they may report it to their employers, when they imagine it any way concerns the government. As &s;oon as a &s;tranger arrives, the Gondoliers, who brought him to Venice, repair to a certain office, and give informa|tion where they took him up, to what hou&s;e they conducted him, and any other particulars they may have picked up.</P>
<P>The citizens form a re&s;pectable body in the &s;tate; and, though they are excluded from the &s;enate, they
<PB N="288" REF="298">
may hold &s;ome very lucrative and important offices. By applying to the arts and &s;ciences, which are en|couraged at Venice, they have a fair chance of living agreeably, and laying up a competency for their families. Private property is no where better &s;ecured than at Venice; and though &s;he no longer enjoys the trade of A&s;ia, without competitors, yet her commerce is &s;till con&s;iderable, and many individuals acquire great wealth by trade. The manufactories e&s;tabli&s;hed here employ all the indu&s;trious poor; and prevent that &s;qualid beggary, that pilfering and robbery, one or other, or all of which, prevail in mo&s;t other countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Their &s;ubjects on the <HI>terra firma</HI> are not at all oppre&s;&s;ed; the &s;enate has found, that mild treatment and good u&s;age are the be&s;t policy, and more ef|fectual than armies, in preventing revolts. The <HI>Po|de&s;tas,</HI> therefore, are not allowed to abu&s;e their power, by treating the people with &s;everity or inju&s;tice. Tho&s;e governors know that any complaints produced again&s;t them, will be &s;crutinized by the &s;enate very carefully. This prevents many abu&s;es of power on their part, and makes the neighbouring prince, which formerly belonged to this &s;tate, regret the chance of war, which ravi&s;hed them from the equitable government of their ancient ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="299">The republic is extremely rigid in the ob&s;ervance of quarantine; and, con&s;idering that they border on tho&s;e countries, where the plague &s;o frequently rages, they cannot be too circum&s;pect. There is not the lea&s;t connivance ever practi&s;ed; all letters, to whom|&s;oever directed, are fir&s;t opened by the officers, and then &s;moaked before they are delivered. A few years &s;ince, a boy got on board one of the ve&s;&s;els, performing quarantine, and &s;tole &s;ome tobacco; he was pur&s;ued into Venice, and &s;hot dead in the &s;treets. There are many cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers in their boats, watching the ve&s;&s;els performing quarantine, night and day, who would certainly kill the fir&s;t man who &s;hould attempt to go on &s;hore before it was expired.</P>
<P>The republic is divided into eleven general go|vernments. No nobleman, indebted to the &s;tate, is permitted to vote in the &s;enate. Commerce, and all menial occupations, are forbidden them. If a noble|man is in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, he has generally &s;ome appointment given him by the &s;enate.</P>
<P>There is great opportunity for chicanery in the courts of law, as each province has its particular cu&s;toms and privileges.</P>
<P>The mode of pleading in their courts of law is very &s;ingular; and gives their lawyers more the appearance
<PB N="290" REF="300">
of a demoniac, than of a man endeavouring, by &s;ound rea&s;on, to convince the judges and the audience, of the ju&s;tice of his client's cau&s;e. Every advocate mounts into a &s;mall pulpit, where he opens his harangue with &s;ome gentlene&s;s, but does not long contain him&s;elf within tho&s;e limits; his voice &s;oon cracks; and, what is very remarkable, the beginning of mo&s;t &s;entences whil&s;t he is under agitation, or &s;eeming enthu&s;ia&s;m in pleading, is at a pitch above his na|tural voice, &s;o as to occa&s;ion a wonderful di&s;cord; then, if he means to be very emphatical, he &s;trikes the pulpit with his hands, five or &s;ix times together, as quick as thought; &s;tamping, at the &s;ame time, &s;o as to make the great room re&s;ound with this &s;pecies of oratory; at length, in the fury of his argument, he de&s;cends from the pulpit, runs about pleading on the floor, returns in a violent pa&s;&s;ion back again to the pulpit, thwarts it with his hands more than at fir&s;t, and continues in this rage, running up and down the pulpit &s;everal times, till he has fini&s;hed his harangue. His wig, all this while, &s;eems to be in continual danger of dropping from his head, and this not un|commonly happens.</P>
<P>This republic has now exi&s;ted above fourteen hund|red years; which is the more extraordinary, con|&s;idering the great number of enemies it has had; and the ruinous and expen&s;ive wars in which it has
<PB N="291" REF="301">

<P>In effect, the Emperor <HI>Maximilian, Louis</HI> XII. <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Spain; <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. King of England; the Pope; all the Princes of Italy; in &s;hort, the Grand Turk; all leagued together again&s;t it, which made it generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that its total downfall was at hand. However, its conduct was &s;o admirable, that after having lo&s;t a great part of its territories, which it could not defend in its fir&s;t mo|ment of attack, it recovered them &s;hortly after, and even put to &s;light the Emperor, who had advanced at the head of an army of 200,000 men, in full confi|dence to era&s;e the very foundations of its capital.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Revenue, Army, Navy, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE annual revenue of the republic is com|puted at twenty-&s;ix millions and a half of French livres, of which the capital alone furni&s;hes twelve millions. The expenditure is made to amount only to twenty-four millions; con&s;equently there is an annual &s;urplus of two millions of French livres. By a regulation made in the year 1786, half a million is allotted every year for defraying the national debt; the intere&s;t of which, at that time, amounted to five millions of livres. Three hundred thou&s;and livres are annually expended in pre&s;ents to the Grand Signior, and the piratical &s;tates of Barbary. In time of war, both the nobles and the other &s;ubjects, even the Doge, contribute proportionably to their income, towards defraying the public expences.</P>
<P>In the army, the republic makes little u&s;e of &s;uch of its &s;ubjects, as live under heavy oppre&s;&s;ions. The flower of its infantry con&s;i&s;ts of thirteen regiments of
<PB N="293" REF="303">
Dalmatians, men of great re&s;olution, but more expert in the u&s;e of the &s;word than of fire arms. The Swi&s;s al&s;o, on occa&s;ion, furni&s;h 6,000 men to be paid by the republic. Their army is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 30,000 men. Owing to the jealou&s;y of the &s;uperior officers, &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed foreigner is appointed commander in chief; but to him are joined two <HI>proveditori gene|rali,</HI> without who&s;e con&s;ent he can do nothing.</P>
<P>Each province has likewi&s;e its &s;eparate militia; and is, be&s;ides, obliged to furni&s;h a certain number of its inhabitants, to be exerci&s;ed in the manoeuvres of the artillery.</P>
<P>The naval force of the republic is al&s;o con&s;ider|able; amounting, according to public accounts, to fourteen men of war, twenty gallea&s;&s;es, and twenty-five galleys, commanded by a captain-general, who is always one of the principal nobility. Under him is the <HI>proveditore generale di mare,</HI> and other great officers.</P>
<P>In time of war, it is &s;aid, the Venetians can equip near thirty &s;hips of the line. In time of peace, there are 12 or 14,000 &s;ailors employed; which, in war time, may be increa&s;ed to 30,000, from the pro|vinces of Dogado and I&s;tria.</P>
<P>Venice formerly held the fir&s;t rank among the trading cities, or rather the trading nations of Eu|rope; and her declen&s;ion, from &s;o brilliant an honour,
<PB N="294" REF="304">
is chiefly owing to two cau&s;es; the di&s;covery of the Cape of Good Hope, and the prohibiting of the no|bility from commerce.</P>
<P>Before the di&s;covery of the Cape of Good Hope, &s;he was the &s;taple both of Europe and A&s;ia, the broker for all the various &s;orts of merchandize, within the commerce of tho&s;e two parts of the world; and likewi&s;e the bank of that opulence, by which it is carried on; in a word, with only the Pi&s;ans and Genoe&s;e, for competitors, &s;he &s;upplied all that Hol|land, England, and France do at pre&s;ent; allowing, however, for the increa&s;e produced by luxury.</P>
<P>This commerce made the greater figure, as it was carried on by the nobility, and the fir&s;t hou&s;es of the &s;tate; which, being governed by the &s;pirit of tho&s;e hou&s;es, had in its wars, conque&s;ts, and treaties, its principal eye on the pro&s;perity of trade.</P>
<P>What a difference between &s;uch a &s;pirit, and that of the chief &s;tates of Europe, at the very &s;ame time! Among them, trade was left to the Jews and Lombards; the &s;overeigns, and every petty lord of our northern counties, looking on it as no more than an expedient, which they daily made u&s;e of, by heavy impo&s;itions, to enrich their trea|&s;ury, and which they often drained by extraordinary burdens, of which hi&s;tory furni&s;hes too many in|&s;tances.
<PB N="295" REF="305">
The&s;e lo&s;&s;es, however, the Lombards and Jews made up by the enormous u&s;uries, which &s;ove|reigns u&s;ed to connive at, in hopes of coming in for a &s;hare. Hence the general contempt and dete&s;|tation for trade, or tho&s;e who followed it. Hence, likewi&s;e, the principles then laid down by the &s;chool|men, concerning u&s;ury; principles in which all the revolutions in the &s;everal branches of commerce have not yet made any change, in nations, who in other re&s;pects are not wanting in per&s;picacity. How very different were the ideas of tho&s;e dark ages, from tho&s;e which the author of the <HI>noble&s;&s;e commercante</HI> has placed in &s;o &s;trong a light! As the latter have gained ground in the re&s;t of Europe, they have declined at Venice; which now makes no le&s;s difference between a nobleman and trader, than a native of France does between a peer and a &s;hoeblack.</P>
<P>Towards the beginning of the fifteenth century, the plain old fa&s;hioned ideas being &s;uperceded by the chimera of military glory, the &s;y&s;tem of the re|public underwent a great change; &s;he a&s;pired to conque&s;ts without any regard to commerce; and this romantic nation alienated the nobility from trade, which had ever made their mo&s;t &s;olid greatne&s;s; and the republic was brought to the very brink of ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="306">She has, indeed, pre&s;erved part of the&s;e ambitious conque&s;ts, but it was by efforts which have quite ex|hau&s;ted her. Yet, it is &s;till that &s;ame trade which upholds the noble hou&s;es again&s;t the deba&s;ement they imagine inherent in commerce; the greater part of their money is either in trade or bank. Printing, originally &s;et up at Venice, by <HI>N. Jan&s;&s;on,</HI> a French|man, though not flouri&s;hing in that pro&s;perity, to which the abilities, indu&s;try, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of the <HI>Manutii,</HI> the <HI>Giuntii,</HI> the <HI>Giolitos,</HI> the <HI>Bevilacquas,</HI> &amp;c. rai&s;ed it, &s;till makes one of the chief branches of the trade of Venice. Several noble hou&s;es place their money in this trade clande&s;tinely, and with a view of lucre; di&s;tantly imitating the <HI>Societa Palatina,</HI> compo&s;ed of the principal noblemen of Milan, who formed and openly keep it up, for the good of litera|ture, and the improvement of the &s;ciences; motions which the highe&s;t nobility need not conceal.</P>
<P>By means of the &s;umptuary laws, the manufactures of the Venetian territory an&s;wer its con&s;umption; and, agreeable to the &s;pirit of the government, they are rather &s;olid than &s;howy: no country in Europe makes better velvets, or &s;ilk &s;tockings. Its looking-gla&s;&s;es and galloons, which were formerly vended all over Europe, now go only to the Levant. The reputation of its treacle is at its ancient height, which it owes to the apparatus and form with which
<PB N="297" REF="307">
it was compo&s;ed, and under the eye of the very Signiory it&s;elf. Pre&s;ents of this treacle are con|&s;idered of value by the Venetian Amba&s;&s;adors at the &s;everal courts of Europe. The wax, which Venice brings from Dalmatia, Greece, and all the Levant, employs many manufactories; where, after being whitened, it is made into candles, the very fine&s;t of which, is no more than about fifteen pence a pound. As to foreign commerce, there is &s;carce any thing done in it, except in fine linens and cali|coes from Switzerland; and cotton, and dying drugs from the Levant, which it &s;ends to Switzerland. This trade is chiefly in the hands of Swi&s;s hou&s;es, &s;ettled at Venice. There is not, indeed, a nation without &s;ome con&s;iderable hou&s;es here. The trade of the&s;e hou&s;es begin with the country from whence they came; but in a little time declining, either for want of &s;upport, or the difficulty of intercour&s;e, they give into the Venetian &s;chemes, and generally turn to banking.</P>
<P>The bank of Venice, called the bank of the Rialto, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> is a very &s;mall office, and the whole bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted by a few clerks, who &s;it in a &s;mall room, like an open booth, which faces the Ex|change. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the bank may aptly be compared to that of a banker in England, where merchants depo&s;it a large &s;um of money, and draw
<PB N="298" REF="308">
upon the &s;hop for their di&s;bur&s;ements. At Venice, every bill of exchange, above a hundred &s;ilver ducats, that is &s;o many times three &s;hillings and fourpence, mu&s;t be paid at the bank. This method, in &s;o large and commercial a city as London, would be very in|convenient; but here is very u&s;eful, as a transfer is fini&s;hed in half a minute, which &s;aves the trouble of weighing and examining the coin; a precaution ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in this country, where many of the &s;equins are light; be&s;ides, that no chicanery can be practi&s;ed in ca&s;e the receipt is lo&s;t, the transfer being a &s;ufficient proof of the payment. It may pre&s;umed too, that the republic has &s;ome private views in this ordinance, be&s;ides the benefit of the merchants; for &s;hould any &s;udden emergency of the &s;tates occur, they have a quantity of each in their hands for im|mediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;tate of religion, and the clergy, in the countries of the republic, the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion is that of the Roman Catholic; but Greeks, Americans, and Jews, are allowed the public exer|ci&s;e of their wor&s;hip; and Prote&s;tants, ob&s;erving privacy, remain unmole&s;ted. At the head of the church government, is the Patriarch of Venice; the chief eccle&s;ia&s;tic in the republic. He is always &s;elected from among the nobility, and cho&s;en by the &s;enate; and, though confirmed by the Pope, mu&s;t, in
<PB N="299" REF="309">
other re&s;pects, be independent of the papal chair. He is Primate of Dalmatia, and other provinces on the continent; his power and dignity, however, are but of little weight, having only the di&s;po&s;al of two benefices in the city of Venice, and being little re|garded by the clergy out of it; who depend immedi|ately on the &s;enate, or are cho&s;en by their re&s;pective congregations.</P>
<P>Though this republic has long maintained a &s;ort of independence from the court of Rome, having &s;hewn them&s;elves weary of the Je&s;uits, two hundred years before any other potentate di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them; while many of the Venetian populace followed them about, crying <HI>andate, andate, niente pigliate, emai ritornate; begone, begone, &s;teal nothing, never, never come back again;</HI> and, although there is a patriarch here, who is attentive to keep his clergy from ever meddling with, or even mentioning affairs of &s;tate, as in &s;uch a ca&s;e the republic would not &s;cruple puni&s;hing them as laymen; yet has Venice kept St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s boat from &s;inking more than once, when &s;he &s;aw the Pope's territories endangered, or his &s;overeignty in&s;ulted; nor is there any city more eminent for the decorum, with which divine &s;ervice is admini&s;tered, or the decent behaviour of individuals, when any &s;acred office is performing. She has ever behaved like a true chri&s;tian potentate, keeping her faith firm, and
<PB N="300" REF="310">
her honour &s;crupulou&s;ly clear, in all treaties and con|ventions with other &s;tates; fewer in&s;tances being given of Venetian fal&s;hood or treachery towards neighbour|ing nations, than of any other European power.</P>
<P>Venice, &s;ay &s;ome writers, is the paradi&s;e of Monks. They go ma&s;qued during the carnival, frequent the theatres, keep mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and do, in &s;hort, ju&s;t what they plea&s;e. Of all the catholic countries, there is none where eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline is more re|laxed. Several of the bi&s;hops have, in vain, at|tempted to reform the&s;e &s;candalous abu&s;es. It is, however, a&s;&s;erted, perhaps not without foundation, that government oppo&s;es &s;uch commendable projects, that the clergy may not, by the&s;e means, have too great influence over the minds of the people.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of Venetian Dalmatia.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fifteenth century, the Venetians reduced the whole kingdom of Dalmatia; though they have &s;ince been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Turks of a con&s;i|derable part. At pre&s;ent, the Hungarians, Venetians, Ragu&s;ans, and Turks, &s;hare it among them. That part of Dalmatia which belongs to the Venetians, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> abounds in ca&s;tles and fortified places, but few are of modern &s;tructure. It comprehends the province of Murlachia, part of the ancient Li|burnia; a country full of high mountains, extending from Zengh to Zara; being in length fifteen German miles, and in breadth between five and &s;ix. Some of the inhabitants of this part of Dalmatia are, indeed, under the protection of Hungary; others are de|&s;cendants of the Venetians; but there is hardly a place of any &s;trength in Dalmatia, which is not go|verned
<PB N="302" REF="312">
by the Murlachians. Dalmatians u&s;e the Sclavonian language and cu&s;toms, and profe&s;s the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>The rivers in Dalmatia have no long cour&s;e, but they are mo&s;tly navigable. The country is, as it were, entirely &s;trewed with mountains, but the&s;e not unfruitful; olives, vines, myrtles, and a great variety of palatable and whole&s;ome vegetables growing upon them, be&s;ides trea&s;ures of gold and &s;ilver ore within them. It has al&s;o many fertile plains; and, be&s;ides a &s;ufficiency of horned cattle, feeds largo flocks of &s;heep. The air is temperate and pure.</P>
<P>The principal towns, in this part of Dalmatia, are Zara, Sibenico, Spalatro, Trace, and Ragu&s;a; the latter, a kind of independent city, with a &s;mall terri|tory, under the protection of the republic of Venice.</P>
<P>Zara, the principal town in Venetian Dalmatia, is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the &s;ea, except a com|munication it has ea&s;tward with the continent, by means of a draw-bridge, commanded by a fort. It is reckoned one of the be&s;t fortifications in Dalmatia, and deemed almo&s;t impregnable. The citadel is divided from the town, by a very deep ditch, hewn out of the rock. The harbour, which is to the North, is capacious, &s;afe, and well guarded. The
<PB N="303" REF="313">
rain is carefully pre&s;erved in ci&s;terns, to &s;upply the want of fre&s;h water. In the ca&s;tle re&s;ides the go|vernor of Dalmatia; who&s;e office is only triennial. It was formerly only a bi&s;hop's &s;ee; but, in 1114, an archbi&s;hop was e&s;tabli&s;hed here. Near the church, which the Greeks call St. <HI>Helia,</HI> are two hand&s;ome fluted columns, of the Corinthian order; &s;uppo&s;ed to have been part of the temple of <HI>Juno.</HI> This place was heretofore much more con&s;iderable, than at pre&s;ent; the circumference of the walls being now but two miles, and the number of the inhabitants, not above 6,000. There are very fine paintings in the churches, done by the be&s;t ma&s;ters; and they pretend to have the body of St. <HI>Simeon,</HI> which was brought from Judea, and is kept in a &s;hrine, with a cry&s;tal before it.</P>
<P>Sibenico is likewi&s;e a very &s;trong town, on the gulph of Venice, twenty-five miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Zara; having four citadels, and a very large harbour. The cathedral of St. <HI>John,</HI> in the ca&s;tle, is a fine marble &s;tructure. Ever &s;ince the be|ginning of the fifteenth century, it has been under the dominion of the Venetians, though it has been no le&s;s than four times be&s;ieged by the Turks. This town, &s;ays <HI>Abbe Fortis,</HI> is famous for the number of men of letters it has produced.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="314">Spalatro is a rich, populous, and &s;trong town, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, thirty-&s;even miles South-ea&s;t of Se|benico, with a good harbour; and is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, who is primate of Dalmatia and Croatia. It is built upon the ruins of the ca&s;tle of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> and its walls make two-thirds of tho&s;e of the city; its temple likewi&s;e is the cathedral church. This place is the &s;taple where all merchandize, pa&s;&s;ing from Turkey into Italy, mu&s;t be tran&s;ported. Near the harbour, which is very large and deep, is erected a very large <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> for performing quarantine. Among the Roman antiquities to be &s;een here, <HI>Dio|cle&s;ian's</HI> palace is particularly worth viewing. This city, ever &s;ince the year 1420, has continued firm to the Venetians.</P>
<P>Trace is another &s;trong and populous town, on the coa&s;t of Dalmatia, belonging to the republic. It is &s;ituated in a &s;mall i&s;land, joined to the main land by a long bridge of wood; and to the i&s;le of Bua, by another of &s;tone. It lies fifteen miles ea&s;t of Spalatro. Nothing can be plea&s;anter than the &s;itua|ation of Trace: the north-&s;ide is covered with beauti|ful gardens; and, on the i&s;land of Bua, it has very very fine &s;uburbs. It is the re&s;idence of the Ve|netian Proveditor, who bears the title of Count. The harbour, which is formed by a bay, has depth of water enough for the large&s;t &s;hips; which ride
<PB N="305" REF="315">
there &s;heltered by two capes. It was an ancient Roman colony of the Emperor <HI>Claudius;</HI> and, &s;o early as the year 997, put it&s;elf under the protection of Venice; on which it has been continually de|pendent, ever &s;ince the year 1420; though not without many changes and di&s;a&s;trous revolutions.</P>
<P>Ragu&s;a is not very large in circumference, but it is, neverthele&s;s, well built; and is the &s;eat of a re|public, and of an archbi&s;hop's &s;ee. It extends to|wards the &s;ea; and both the city and harbour are defended by fort St. <HI>Lorenzo.</HI> Were the rock of of Chiroma, which lies in the &s;ea, and belongs to the Venetians, fortified, it would be impregnable. The air is whole&s;ome, but the &s;oil &s;o barren, that the in|habitants receive the greate&s;t part of their nece&s;&s;aries from the neighbouring Turki&s;h provinces. The cir|cumjacent i&s;lands are all fertile, plea&s;ant, well in|habited, and embelli&s;hed with fine towns, &s;tately palaces, and beautiful gardens. This city lies one hundred and two miles South-ea&s;t of Spolatro.</P>
<P>The government, of this city and &s;tate, is ari&s;to|cratic; and formed nearly after the model of that of Venice. It is in the hands of the nobility; who are, at pre&s;ent, greatly dimini&s;hed. The chief of the republic, who is &s;tiled rector, is changed every month, and elected by &s;crutiny, or lot. Du|ring
<PB N="306" REF="316">
his admini&s;tration, he lives in the palace, wears a ducal habit; namely, a long &s;ilk robe, with white &s;leeves, and his &s;alary is five ducats a month; but if he is one of the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> he receives a ducat per day. Next to him is the council of ten. In the great council all noblemen, above twenty years of age, are admitted; and, in this council al&s;o, are cho&s;en the per&s;ons who con&s;titute the board of the Pregadi. The&s;e la&s;t &s;uperintend all affairs, civil and military; di&s;po&s;e of all employments, and re|ceive and &s;end envoys. The revenues of the re|public are &s;aid to have amounted, formerly, to a ton of gold; but, being unable to defend it&s;elf, they have procured &s;everal protectors; the principal of whom is the Grand Signior. It is &s;aid, they pay tribute to the Turks out of fear; to the Venetians, out of hatred; and to the Pope, Emperor, Spain, and Naples, out of re&s;pect, and political views. The tribute to the Porte, with the expence of the annual emba&s;&s;y, is about 20,000 zequins. The Turks are very &s;erviceable to them; bringing hither all kinds of nece&s;&s;aries, e&s;pecially fire-arms and military &s;tores.</P>
<P>They keep &s;o watchful an eye over their freedom, that the gates of the city of Ragu&s;a are allowed to be open only a few hours in the day. They wholly profe&s;s the Catholic religion, but the Greek, Arme|nian, and Turki&s;h per&s;ua&s;ions, are tolerated among
<PB N="307" REF="317">
them for convenience. The language, chiefly in u&s;e among the Ragu&s;ans, is the Sclavonian; but the greater part of them &s;peak al&s;o the Italian. The citizens are, almo&s;t to a man, traders; and this place di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf by the finene&s;s of its manufactures. Silk is allowed to be worn here only by the rector, nobles, and doctors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Morlacchi.</HEAD>
<P>A Pretty full account of the &s;ingular cu&s;toms and manners of the Morlacchi, a race of people inhabiting the mountains of Venetian Dalmatia, and until the Abbe <HI>Fortis</HI> penetrate that country, but little known to the re&s;t of Europe, will, we flatter our&s;elves, not appear unintere&s;ting to our readers.</P>
<P>There is not only a great difference in dialect, dre&s;s, di&s;po&s;ition, and cu&s;toms, between the maritime and tran&s;alpine inhabitants of Dalmatia, &s;ays Abbe
<PB N="308" REF="318">
<HI>Fortis;</HI> but even a remarkable diver&s;ity, among the Morlacchi them&s;elves, in &s;everal di&s;tricts; derived, perhaps, from the different countries from whence they come. The inhabitants of Cotar are generally fair, with blue eyes, a broad face, and flat no&s;e; but tho&s;e of Vergoraz have dark coloured hair, a long face, tawny colour, and tall &s;tature. The qualities of their mind are al&s;o as different, as tho&s;e of the body; for, the Morlacchi of Cotar are generally mild, re|&s;pectful, and tractable; but tho&s;e of Vergoraz are &s;urly, proud, bold, and enterprizing. They have al&s;o a &s;trong inclination to theft; owing, in part, to their &s;ituation among barren and inacce&s;&s;ible moun|tains. Among the artful and bold &s;trokes of knavery, which they tell of one of the&s;e <HI>Vergozani,</HI> the fol|lowing is characteri&s;tic. The rogue was at a fair; and a countryman having bought a copper kettle, laid it down, together with his bundle, ju&s;t by his &s;ide; the Vergoroon, who &s;tood hard by, took up the kettle, while the pea&s;ant was talking to an ac|quaintance, and &s;et it on his head, without &s;tirring from his place; the other, having fini&s;hed his con|ference, turned about to take up his things, but the kettle was gone; and a&s;king him, who had it on his head, if he had not &s;een &s;omebody carry it off, he was an&s;wered: "Truly friend, I was not minding the&s;e things, but if you had put your kettle on your head, as you &s;ee I did, you would not have lo&s;t it."
<PB N="309" REF="319">
Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e mi&s;chievous tricks, which are frequent enough, a &s;tranger may travel &s;ecurely among them, and will be ho&s;pitably treated.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t danger is from the <HI>Haiduks,</HI> of whom great numbers have retreated among the woods, and caves, of tho&s;e dreadful mountains on the confines. They lead their life among wolves, wandering from one precipice to another, agitated by continual fears and &s;u&s;picions, expo&s;ed to the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;ons; and, often deprived of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, langui&s;h in the mo&s;t &s;olitary hideous caverns. Were &s;uch men to commit acts of violence, irritated by the con|&s;tant view of their mi&s;erable &s;ituation, it would be no wonder; yet they &s;eldom di&s;turb the tranquility of others, and prove always faithful guides to travellers. The chief objects of their rapine are oxen and &s;heep, to &s;upply them&s;elves with food and &s;hoes. It happens &s;ometimes, in their extreme nece&s;&s;ity, that the Hai|duks go in parties to the &s;hepherds cottages, and readily demand &s;omething to eat, which they immedi|ately take by force, if the lea&s;t he&s;itation is made; though they &s;eldom meet with a refu&s;al, or re&s;i&s;tance, as their re&s;olution and fury are well known to be equal to their wants, and the &s;avage life they lead. Four Haiduks are not afraid to a&s;&s;ault a caravan of fifteen or twenty Turks; and generally plunder and put them to flight. When a Haiduk happens to be

taken by the Panduri, they do not bind him as our &s;birri are u&s;ed to do, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis;</HI> but, untying the &s;trings of his breeches, they fall down on his heels, and prevent a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The morals of a Morlach, &s;ays the Abbe, at a di&s;|tance from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and garri&s;ons, are very dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the Italians. The &s;incerity, tru&s;t, and hone&s;ty, of tho&s;e poor people, not only in contracts, but in all the ordinary actions of their life, would be called &s;implicity and weakne&s;s among us. The Morlach, naturally ho&s;pitable and generous, opens his poor cottage to the &s;tranger, and &s;erves him, to the utmo&s;t of his power, without demanding, nay, often ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing, the lea&s;t recompence; and I have more than once, adds the Abbe, got a dinner from one of tho&s;e men, who knew nothing about me, had never before &s;een me, and could not expect ever to &s;ee me again.</P>
<P>The Morlacchi are extremely &s;en&s;ible of mild treatment; and, when they meet with it, are ready to perform every po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice, and to become cordial friends. Their ho&s;pitality is equally con&s;picuous among the poor, as among the more opulent. The rich prepares a roa&s;ted lamb, or &s;heep; and the poor, with equal cordiality, gives his turkey, milk, honey, or whatever el&s;e he has. Nor is their genero&s;ity con|fined
<PB N="311" REF="321">
to &s;trangers; but generally extends it&s;elf to all who are in want.</P>
<P>When a Morlach is on a journey, and comes to lodge at a friend's hou&s;e, the elde&s;t daughter of the family, or the new married bride, if there happens to be one, receives and ki&s;&s;es him when he alights from his hor&s;e, or at the door of the hou&s;e. But a fo|reigner is rarely favoured with the&s;e female civilities; on the contrary, the women, if they are young, hide them&s;elves, and keep out of his way. Perhaps more than one violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality has made them thus re&s;erved to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>While there is any thing to eat in the hou&s;e of tho&s;e villagers, the poor of the neighbourhood are welcome to partake of it; and hence it is, that no Morlach ever humbles him&s;elf to a&s;k alms of a pa&s;&s;enger. I, indeed, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> have often been forced to a&s;k &s;omething from poor &s;hepherds, but I always found them liberal; and many times, in travelling through the fields, in the heat of &s;ummer, I have met poor reapers, who, of their own accord, pre&s;ented me with their fla&s;ks to drink, and offered me a part of their ru&s;tic provi&s;ions, with an affecting cordiality.</P>
<P>The Morlacchi, in general, have little notion of dome&s;tic oeconomy; and readily con&s;ume, in a week,
<PB N="312" REF="322">
as much as would be &s;ufficient for &s;everal months, when any occa&s;ion of merriment pre&s;ents it&s;elf. Yet, the Morlach is a great economi&s;t, in the u&s;e of his wearing apparel; for, rather than &s;poil his new cap, he takes it off, let it rain ever &s;o hard, and goes bareheaded in the &s;torm. In the &s;ame manner he treats his &s;hoes, if the road be dirty, and they not very old. Nothing but an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility hinders a Morlach from being punctual; and if he cannot repay the money he borrowed, at the ap|pointed time, he carries a &s;mall pre&s;ent to his creditor, and reque&s;ts a longer term. Thus it happens, &s;ome|times, that from term to term, and pre&s;ent to pre|&s;ent, he pays double what he owed, without reflecting on it.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip, that among other nations is &s;o &s;ubject to change, on the &s;lighte&s;t motives, is la&s;ting among the Morlacchi. They have even made it a kind of religious point, and tie the &s;acred bond at the foot of the altar. The Sclavonian ritual contains a particular benediction, for the &s;olemn union of two male, or two female friends, in the pre&s;ence of the congregation. I was pre&s;ent, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> at the union of two young women, who were made <HI>Po&s;e&s;tre,</HI> in the church of Pene&s;&s;ich. The &s;atisfaction that &s;parkled in their eyes, when the ceremony was performed, gave a convincing proof, that delicacy of &s;entiments
<PB N="313" REF="323">
can lodge in minds not formed, or rather not cor|rupted, by that &s;ociety, which we call civilized. The male friends, thus united, are called <HI>Pobratimi;</HI> and the male &s;i&s;ters, <HI>Po&s;e&s;treme;</HI> which means half brothers and half &s;i&s;ters. The duties of the <HI>Pobratimi</HI> are to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, in every ca&s;e of need or danger; to revenge mutual wrongs, and the like. The enthu&s;ia&s;m is often carried &s;o far as to ri&s;k, and even to lo&s;e their life for the <HI>Pobratimi.</HI> If di&s;|cord happens to ari&s;e between two friends, it is mentioned all over the country, as a &s;candalous no|velty; and there have been &s;ome examples of it, of late years, to the great affliction of the old Morlac|chi; who attribute the depravation of their country|men, to their intercour&s;e with the Italians.</P>
<P>The natural vivacity, and enterprizing &s;pirit of the Morlacchi, qualify them to &s;ucceed in any kind of employment. In particular, they make excellent &s;oldiers; and, towards the end of the la&s;t century, performed &s;ignal &s;ervice under the brave Venetian General <HI>Dalfino;</HI> who conquered an important tract of country belonging to the Porte, chiefly by their means. They al&s;o become very expert in the di|rection of mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s; and ea&s;ily learn to read and write, even after they are grown up.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="324">Notwith&s;tanding their excellent di&s;po&s;ition to learn every art, the Morlacchi have the mo&s;t imperfect no|tions of hu&s;bandry; and are very un&s;kilful in the ma|nagement of their cattle, and in curing di&s;ea&s;es. They have a &s;ingular veneration for old cu&s;toms; and little care has hitherto been taken, either to remove their prejudices, or to teach them better methods. Their ploughs, and other rural uten&s;ils, &s;eem to be of the mo&s;t rude invention. They make chee&s;e, butter, and cream-chee&s;e too, in their way. The taylor's art is confined to ancient and unalterable patterns, which are always cut from the &s;ame kind of cloth; &s;o that any difference in the u&s;ual breadth would quite di&s;concert a Morlach taylor. They have &s;ome notions of dying, and their colours are not de&s;pi|cable. Their black is made of the bark of the a&s;h-tree, laid in warm water for eight days, with &s;ome iron dro&s;s, which they gather from the black&s;miths forges; they then make u&s;e of this water, when cold, to give the colour. They al&s;o extract a fine blue from the infu&s;ion of wood, dried in the &s;hade, in a lie of a&s;hes, well purified; they let this mixture boil &s;everal hours, and tinge the cloth in the water, when cold. <HI>Scodanus,</HI> by them called <HI>Rez,</HI> gives yellow and brown; they al&s;o obtain a yellow from the <HI>Evoni|mus,</HI> known there by the name of <HI>Puzzolina.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="325">Almo&s;t all the Morlach women are &s;kilful in works of embroidery, and knitting. Their embroidery is curious, and exactly the &s;ame on both &s;ides. They al&s;o make a &s;ort of knit, or net-work, very curious; which they chiefly u&s;e as a kind of bu&s;kin to their &s;lippers and brogues. They are in no want of looms to weave their &s;erge, and other coar&s;e cloth; but the women have not much time to apply to the&s;e things, their offices among the Morlacchi, not admitting &s;edentary labours.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of their villages they make earthern ware, very coar&s;e indeed, but very durable.</P>
<P>The Morlachs, whether they happen to be of the Roman, or of the Greek church, have very &s;ingular ideas about religion; and the ignorance of their teachers daily augments this mon&s;trous evil. They are as firmly per&s;uaded of the reality of witches, fairies, enchantments, nocturnal apparitions, and &s;or|cilage, as if they had &s;een a thou&s;and examples of them. Nor do they make the lea&s;t doubt about the exi&s;tence of Vampires; and attribute to them, as in Tran&s;ilvania, the &s;ucking the blood of infants. There|fore, when a man dies, &s;u&s;pected of becoming a Vampire, or <HI>Vutrodlach,</HI> as they call it, they cut his hams, and prick his whole body with pins; pretend|ing, that after this operation, he cannot walk about.
<PB N="316" REF="326">
There are even in&s;tances of Morlacchi, who, ima|gining they may po&s;&s;ibly thir&s;t for children's blood after death, intreat their heirs, and &s;ometimes oblige them, to promi&s;e to treat them as a vampire, when they die.</P>
<P>The bolde&s;t Haiduk would fly trembling from the apparition of a &s;pectre, gho&s;t, phantom, or &s;uch like goblins as the heated imagination of credulous and pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed people never fail to &s;ee. Nor are they a&s;hamed, when ridiculed for this terror; but an&s;wer much in the words of <HI>Pindar:</HI>&mdash;"Fear that proceeds from &s;pirits, cau&s;es even the &s;ons of the gods to fly." The women, as may be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, are a hundred times more timorous and vi&s;ionary than the men; and &s;ome of them, by frequently hearing them|&s;elves called witches, actually believe they are &s;o. The old witches are acquainted with many &s;pells; and one of the mo&s;t frequent is, to transfer the milk of other people's cows to their own.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t perfect di&s;cord reigns in Morlacchi, as it generally does in other parts, between the Latin and Greek communion, which their re&s;pective prie&s;ts fail not to foment, and tell a thou&s;and little &s;candalous &s;tories of each other. The churches of the Latins are poor, and &s;hamefully ill kept. I have &s;een, &s;ays the Abbe, the curate of a Morlach village, &s;itting on
<PB N="317" REF="327">
the ground in the church yard, to hear the confe&s;&s;ions of women, on their knees, by his &s;ide; a &s;trange picture indeed! but a proof of the innocent manners of the&s;e good people, who have the mo&s;t profound veneration for their &s;piritual pa&s;tors, and a total de|pendence on them; who, for their part, frequently make u&s;e of a di&s;cipline rather military, and correct the bodies of their offending flock with the cudgel. Perhaps this particular is carried to an abu&s;e, as well as that of public penance, which they pretend to inflict after the manner of the ancient church. Far|ther, through the &s;illy credulity of the&s;e poor moun|taineers, they draw illicit profits, by &s;elling certain &s;uper&s;titious &s;crolls, and other &s;candalous merchan|dize of that kind.</P>
<P>Innocence, and the natural liberty of pa&s;toral ages, &s;ays <HI>Fortis,</HI> are &s;till pre&s;erved among the Mor|lacchi. Pure cordiality of &s;entiment is not there re|&s;trained by other regards, and di&s;plays it&s;elf without any di&s;tinction of circum&s;tances. A hand&s;ome young Morlach girl, who meets a man of her di&s;trict, on the road, ki&s;&s;es him affectionately, without the lea&s;t immode&s;t thought; and, I have &s;een all the women and girls, all the young men and old, ki&s;&s;ing one another as they came into the church-yard on a holiday; &s;o that they looked as if they had been all belonging to one family. I have often ob&s;erved
<PB N="318" REF="328">
the &s;ame thing on the road; and, at the fairs, in the maritime towns, where the Morlacchi came to &s;ell their commodities. In times of fea&s;ting and merri|ment, &s;ome other little liberties are taken, which we &s;hould not reckon decent, but which are not minded among them; and when they are told of it, they an|&s;wer, it is only toying, and means nothing. From this toying, however, their amours often take their beginning, and frequently end &s;eriou&s;ly, when the two lovers are once agreed. For it very rarely happens, that a Morlacco carries off a girl again&s;t her will, or di&s;honours her; and were &s;uch attempts made, the young woman would, no doubt, be able to defend her&s;elf, the women in that country being generally very little le&s;s robu&s;t than the men. But the cu&s;tom is, for the woman her&s;elf to appoint the time and place of being carried off; and &s;he does &s;o, in order to extricate her&s;elf from other &s;uitors, from whom &s;he may have received &s;ome love-token; &s;uch as a bra&s;s ring, a little knife, or &s;uch like trifles.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Morlach women is different in dif|ferent parts of the country; but it appears every where &s;trange to an European. That of the unmar|ried women is the mo&s;t complex and whim&s;ical, in re&s;pect to the ornaments of the head; for, when married, they are not allowed to wear any thing el&s;e but a handkerchief, either white or coloured, tied
<PB N="319" REF="329">
about it. The girls wear a &s;carlet cap, to which they commonly hang a veil, falling down on their &s;houl|ders. The better &s;ort adorn their caps with &s;trings of &s;ilver coins; they have ear-rings of very curious work, and &s;mall &s;ilver chains, with the figures of half moons fa&s;tened to the end of them. The principal merit of the&s;e caps, which con&s;titute the good ta&s;te, as well as vanity of the Morlach young ladies, is to attend and fix the eyes of all who are near them, by the multitude of ornaments, and the noi&s;e they make, on the lea&s;t motion of their heads. In &s;ome di&s;tricts they fix tufts of various coloured feathers, re&s;embling two horns on their caps; at others, tremulous plumes of &s;pun-gla&s;s; and in others, artificial flowers, which they purcha&s;e in the &s;ea-port towns; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the variety of the&s;e capricious and barbarous ornaments, &s;ometimes a fancy, not inele|gant, is di&s;played. Their holiday &s;hifts are em|broidered with red &s;ilk, and &s;ometimes with gold, which they work them&s;elves, while they attend their flocks; and, it is &s;urprizing to &s;ee how nicely their work is executed. Both old and young women wear about their necks large &s;trings of round gla&s;s beads, of various &s;izes and colours; and many rings of bra&s;s, tin, or &s;ilver, on their fingers. Their bracelets are of leather, covered with wrought tin, or &s;ilver; and they embroider their &s;tomachers, or adorn them with beads, or &s;hells. But the u&s;e of &s;tays is unknown;
<PB N="320" REF="330">
nor do they put iron or whalebone in the &s;tomacher. A broad woollen girdle &s;urrounds their petticoat; which is commonly decked with &s;hells of a blue colour, and therefore called <HI>Modrina.</HI> Their gown, as well as petticoat, is a kind of &s;erge; and both reach near to the ancle; the gown is bordered with &s;carlet, and called <HI>Sadak.</HI> They u&s;e no <HI>Modrina</HI> in &s;ummer; and only wear the <HI>Sadak,</HI> without &s;leeves, over a linen petticoat, or &s;hift. The girls always wear red &s;tockings, and their &s;hoes are, like tho&s;e of the men, called <HI>Opanke.</HI> The &s;ole is of undre&s;&s;ed ox|hide, and the upper part, of &s;heep's &s;kin thongs knitted, which they call <HI>apute;</HI> and the&s;e they fa&s;ten above the ankles, &s;omething like the ancient co|thurnus.</P>
<P>The unmarried women, even of the riche&s;t fa|milies, are not permitted to wear any other &s;ort of &s;hoes; though, after marriage, they may, if they plea&s;e, lay a&s;ide the <HI>opanke,</HI> and u&s;e Turki&s;h &s;lippers. The girls keep their hair tre&s;&s;ed under their caps; but, when married, they let it fall di&s;hevelled on their brea&s;t; &s;ometimes they tie it under the chin; and always have medals, beads, or bored coins, in the Tartar or American mode, twi&s;ted among&s;t it. An unmarried woman, who falls under the imputation of want of cha&s;tity, runs the ri&s;k of having her red cap torn off publicly in church, by the curate, and her
<PB N="321" REF="331">
hair cut by &s;ome relation in token of infamy. Hence if any of them happen to fall into an illicit amour, they commonly, of their own accord, lay a&s;ide the badge of virginity, and remove into another part of the country.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more common among the Mor|lacchi, than marriages concluded between the the old people of the re&s;pective families; e&s;pecially where the parties live at a great di&s;tance, and nei|ther &s;ee, nor know each other; and the ordinary mo|tive of the&s;e alliances is, the ambition of being re|lated to a numerous and powerful family, famous for having produced valliant men. The father of the future bridegroom, or &s;ome other near relation, of mature age, goes to a&s;k the young woman, or rather a young woman of &s;uch a family, not having com|monly any determinate choice. Upon this all the girls
<PB N="322" REF="332">
in the hou&s;e are &s;hewn to him, and he chu&s;es which plea&s;es him be&s;t; though generally re&s;pecting the rights of &s;eniority. A denial, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, is very rare; nor does the father of the maid enquire much into the circum&s;tances of the family that a&s;ks her. Sometimes a daughter of the ma&s;ter is given in mar|riage to the &s;ervant, or tenant, as was u&s;ual in the pa|triarchal times. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, however, the Morlacchi girls enjoy a privilege, which ours would al&s;o wi&s;h to have; as, in ju&s;tice, they certainly ought. For he who acts by proxy, having obtained his &s;uit, is obliged to go and bring the bridegroom; and if, on &s;eeing each other, the young people are reciprocally content, then the marriage is concluded, but not otherwi&s;e. In &s;ome parts, it is the cu&s;tom for the bride to go and &s;ee the hou&s;e and family of her pro|po&s;ed hu&s;band, before &s;he gives a definitive an&s;wer; and if the place, or per&s;ons, are di&s;agreeable to her, &s;he is at liberty to break the contract. But if &s;he be contented, &s;he returns to her father's hou&s;e, e&s;corted by the bridegroom and neare&s;t relations. There the marriage day is fixed; on which the bridegroom comes to the bride's hou&s;e, attended by all his friends of greate&s;t note, who, on this occa&s;ion, are called <HI>Svati,</HI> and are all armed, and on hor&s;eback, in their holiday cloaths, with a peacock's feather in their cap, which is the di&s;tinctive ornament u&s;ed by tho&s;e who
<PB N="323" REF="333">
are invited to weddings. The company goes armed to repul&s;e any attack, or ambu&s;h, that might be in|tended to di&s;turb the fea&s;t. For in old times the&s;e encounters were not unfrequent, according to the records of many national heroic &s;ongs. In one of the&s;e is told the &s;tory of <HI>Janco Vojvod,</HI> of Sebigne, cotemporary with the famous <HI>George Ca&s;triolich,</HI> named <HI>Scanderberg,</HI> and betrothed to <HI>Jagna,</HI> of Teme&s;war; who&s;e brothers, being not his friends, when he came to conclude the marriage, engaged him in the punc|tilio of performing &s;everal feats, upon condition, that if he &s;ucceeded, he was to have the bride; if not, he was to lo&s;e his life. The&s;e were, as the &s;ong relates, that he was to pierce an apple, &s;tuck on the point of a &s;pear, with his dart, at a certain di&s;tance; then he was to &s;pring over nine hor&s;es, placed one be&s;ide another, at one leap; and, la&s;tly, to di&s;cover his future &s;pou&s;e, among nine young women, all covered with veils. <HI>Janco,</HI> it &s;eems, was a valiant &s;oldier, but not expert in &s;uch trials of &s;kill; however, his nephew undertook them in his place, and no ob|jection was made, as they &s;ay, is the cu&s;tom in a certain i&s;land, to hire one to fight for another at a boxing match. The expedient made u&s;e of by <HI>Ze|culo, Janco's</HI> nephew, to know the bride among the other nine young women, was &s;ingular, and merits a prolongation of our digre&s;&s;ion. He opened his mantle on the ground, threw a handful of gold rings
<PB N="324" REF="334">
on it, and then gallantly addre&s;&s;ed the ladies as fol|lows: "Lovely maid, who art de&s;tined to be <HI>Janco</HI>'s wife, do thou pick up the&s;e gold rings and wear them; but if any other dares to touch one of them, I will cut off her arm at a blow." The nine young women were very naturally afraid of the danger, and did not chu&s;e to advance; &s;o <HI>Janco</HI>'s bride collected the rings, and thus the nuptial games were fini&s;hed. When, upon trials of this nature, one of the parties found him&s;elf excluded, and another preferred, as he thought, unju&s;tly, he commonly had recour&s;e to arms for redre&s;s; and much blood was often &s;hed in tho&s;e combats; and many tombs of the ancient Sclavi are &s;till to be &s;een in the woods, and de&s;ert places of Mor|lacchi, whereon the&s;e feuds are engraved in coar&s;e bas-relief.</P>
<P>The bride is conducted to a church, veiled, and &s;urrounded by the <HI>Svati</HI> on hor&s;eback; and the &s;acred ceremony is performed amid&s;t the noi&s;e of mu&s;kets, pi&s;tols, barbarous &s;houts, and acclamations, which continue till &s;he returns to her father's hou&s;e, or to that of her hu&s;band, if not far off.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day's entertainment is &s;ometimes made at the bride's hou&s;e, but generally at the bridegroom's. The <HI>Domachin,</HI> or head of the hou&s;e, comes out to meet his daughter-in-law, and a child is handed to
<PB N="325" REF="335">
her, before &s;he alights, to care&s;s it; and if there happens to be none in the hou&s;e, the child is bor|rowed from one of the neighbours. When &s;he alights, &s;he kneels down, and ki&s;&s;es the thre&s;hold. Then the mother-in-law, or in her place &s;ome other female rela|tion, pre&s;ents a corn &s;ieve, full of different kinds of grain, nuts, almonds, and other &s;mall fruit, which the bride &s;catters upon the Svati, by handfuls, behind her back. The bride does not &s;it at the great table the fir&s;t day, but has one apart for her&s;elf. The bride|groom &s;its at table with the Svati; but in all that day, con&s;ecrated to the matrimonial union, he mu&s;t neither unloo&s;e, nor cut any thing whatever. The Knum, or Spon&s;or, carries his meat, and cuts his bread. The Domachin gives the toa&s;ts. Generally the Bukkara, a very large wooden cup, goes round, fir&s;t to the Saint, protector of the family; next to the pro&s;perity of the holy faith; and &s;ometimes, to a name the mo&s;t &s;ublime and venerable. The mo&s;t extravagant abun|dance reigns at their fea&s;ts; and each of the Svati contributes, by &s;ending a &s;hare of provi&s;ions. The dinner begins with fruit and chee&s;e, and the &s;oup comes la&s;t; ju&s;t contrary to our cu&s;tom. All &s;orts of dome&s;tic fowls, kid, lamb, and &s;ometimes veni&s;on, are heaped in prodigious quantities on their tables; but very rarely a Morlacco eats veal; and perhaps never, unle&s;s he has been per&s;uaded to do it out of his own country. This abhorrence to calves fle&s;h
<PB N="326" REF="336">
is very ancient among the Morlacchi. <HI>S. Jerome</HI> takes notice of it; and <HI>Tomeo Marnovich,</HI> a Bo&s;nian wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, of the la&s;t century, &s;ays, that the Dalmatians, uncorrupted by the vices of &s;trangers, ab&s;tained from calves fle&s;h, as an unclean food, even to his days. The women relations, if they are invited, never dine at table with the men; it being an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom for them to dine by them&s;elves. After dinner, they pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in dancing, &s;inging ancient &s;ongs, and in games of dexterity, or of art and fancy; and in the evening, at a convenient hour after &s;upper, the three ritual healths having fir&s;t gone round, the Knum accompanies the bridegroom to the matri|monial apartment; which commonly is the cellar, or the &s;table. If there happens to be any bed prepared, better than &s;traw, he leads them to it; and, having untied the bride's girdle, he cau&s;es them both to undre&s;s each other reciprocally. It is not long &s;ince the Knum was obliged to undre&s;s the bride entirely; but that cu&s;tom is now out of u&s;e; and, in&s;tead of it, he has the privilege of ki&s;&s;ing her as often as he plea&s;es, whenever he meets her. When they are both undre&s;&s;ed, the Knum retires, and &s;tands li&s;tening at the door, if there be a door. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to announce the con&s;ummation of the marriage, which he does by di&s;charging a pi&s;tol, and is an&s;wered by many of the company. The next day, the bride, without her veil, and virginal cap, dines at table with
<PB N="327" REF="337">
the Svati, and is forced to hear the coar&s;e equivocal je&s;ts of her indelicate, and, &s;ometimes, intoxicated company.</P>
<P>The&s;e nuptial fea&s;ts continue three, &s;ix, eight, or more days, according to the ability or prodigal di&s;|po&s;ition of the family where they are held. The new married wife gets no incon&s;iderable profit in the&s;e days of joy. And it u&s;ually amounts to much more than all the portion &s;he brings with her; which often con&s;i&s;ts of nothing but her own cloaths, and perhaps a cow; nay, it happens &s;ometimes, that the parents, in&s;tead of giving money with their daughter, get &s;omething from the bridegroom by way of price. The bride carries water every morning to wa&s;h the hands of her gue&s;ts, as long as the fea&s;ting la&s;ts; and each of them throws a &s;mall piece of money into the ba&s;on, after performing that function; which is a very rare one among them, excepting on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The brides are al&s;o permitted to rai&s;e other little con|tributions among the Svati, by hiding their &s;hoes, caps, knives, or &s;ome other part of their equipage; which they are obliged to ran&s;om by a piece of money, according as the company rates it. And, be&s;ides all the&s;e voluntary or extorted contributions, already mentioned, each gue&s;t mu&s;t give &s;ome pre&s;ent to the new married wife, at taking leave; and then &s;he al&s;o
<PB N="328" REF="338">
di&s;tributes &s;ome trifles in return, which commonly con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hirts, caps, handkerchiefs, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>The nuptial rites are almo&s;t preci&s;ely the &s;ame through all the country, inhabited by the Morlacchi; and tho&s;e in u&s;e among the pea&s;ants, and common people of the &s;ea coa&s;t of Dalmatia, I&s;tria, and the i&s;lands, differ but little from them. Yet, among the&s;e particular varieties, there is one of the i&s;land Zlarine, near Sebenico, remarkable enough; for there the principal gue&s;t, (who may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed drunk at that hour), mu&s;t, at one blow, with his naked broad &s;word, &s;trike the bride's crown of flowers off her head, when &s;he is ready to go to bed. And, in the i&s;land of Pago, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tom more comical, and le&s;s dangerous; but equally &s;avage and brutal, After the marriage contract is &s;ettled, and the bridegroom comes to conduct the bride to church, her father, or mother, in delivering her over to him, makes an exaggerated enumeration of her ill qualities; "Know, &s;ince thou wilt have her, that &s;he is good for nothing, ill-natured, ob&s;tinate, &amp;c." On which the bridegroom, affecting an angry look, turns to the young woman, with an "Ah! &s;ince it is &s;o, I will teach you better manners;" and then regales her with a blow or a kick, or &s;ome &s;imilar piece of gal|lantry, which is by no means figurative. And, it &s;eems in general, that the Morlach women, and
<PB N="329" REF="339">
perhaps the greate&s;t part of the Dalmatians, the in habitants of the cities excepted, do not di&s;like a beat|ing now and then, either from their hu&s;bands, or lovers.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Derni&s;h, the women are obliged, during the fir&s;t year after their marriage, to ki&s;s all their national acquaintance who come to the hou&s;e; but, after the fir&s;t year, they are di&s;pen&s;ed from that compliment; and, indeed, they become &s;o intolerably na&s;ty, that they are no longer fit to practi&s;e it. Perhaps, the mortifying manner, in which they are treated by their hu&s;bands and re|lations, is, at the &s;ame time, both the cau&s;e and effect of this &s;hameful neglect of their per&s;ons. When a Morlach hu&s;band mentions his wife, he always pre|mi&s;es, by your leave, or begging your pardon. And, when the hu&s;band has a bed&s;tead, the wife mu&s;t &s;leep on the floor near it.</P>
<P>The pregnancy and births, of the Morlacch women, would be thought very extraordinary among us, where the ladies &s;uffer &s;o much, notwith&s;tanding all the care and circum&s;pection u&s;ed before, and after labour. On the contrary, a Morlach woman neither changes her food, nor interrupts her daily fatigue, on account of her pregnancy; and is frequently de|livered in the fields, or on the road, by her&s;elf; and
<PB N="330" REF="340">
takes the infant, wa&s;hes it in the fir&s;t water &s;he finds, carries it home, and returns the day after to her u&s;ual labour, or to feed her flocks. The cu&s;tom of the nation is invariable in wa&s;hing the new born infants in cold water. The little creatures, thus carele&s;sly treated in their tendere&s;t moments, are afterwards wrapped in mi&s;erable rags, where they remain three or four months under the &s;ame ungentle treatment; and, when that term is elap&s;ed, they are &s;et at liberty, and left to crawl about the cottage, and before the door, till they learn to walk upright by them&s;elves; and, at the &s;ame time, acquire that &s;ingular degree of &s;trength, and health, with which the Morlacchi are endowed; and are able, without the lea&s;t inconveni|ence, to expo&s;e their naked brea&s;ts to the &s;evere&s;t fro&s;t and &s;now. The infants are allowed to &s;uck their mother's milk whil&s;t &s;he has any; or till &s;he is with child again; and, if that &s;hould not happen for three, four, or &s;ix years, they continue all that time to re|ceive nouri&s;hment from the brea&s;t. The prodigious length of the brea&s;ts of the Morlacch women is &s;ome|what exraordinary; for, it is very certain, that they can give the teat to their children over their &s;houlder, or under their arms. They let the boys run without breeches, in a &s;hirt that reaches only to the knee, till the age of thirteen or fourteen; following the cu&s;tom of the Bo&s;nians, &s;ubject to the Porte, where no capitation tax is paid for the boys, till they wear
<PB N="331" REF="341">
breeches; they being con&s;idered, before that time, as children not capable of labouring, or of earning their bread. On the occa&s;ion of births, and e&s;pecially of the fir&s;t, all the relations and friends &s;end pre&s;ents, of eatables, to the woman in childbed, or rather to the woman delivered; and the family makes a &s;upper of all the&s;e pre&s;ents together. The women do not enter the church till forty days after child-birth.</P>
<P>The Morlacchi pa&s;s their youth in the woods, attending their flocks and herds; and, in that life of quiet, and lei&s;ure, they often become dexterous in carving with a &s;imple knife; they make wooden cups, and whi&s;tles, adorned with fanciful bas-reliefs, which are not void of merit; and, at lea&s;t, &s;hews the genius of the people.</P>
<P>Milk, coagulated in various ways, is the ordinary nouri&s;hment of the Morlacchi; they &s;ometimes give it an agreeable acid by the infu&s;ion of vinegar, whereby the curd becomes extremely refre&s;hing; and the whey is their favourite common drink; nor is it at all unplea&s;ant to a &s;tranger's ta&s;te. When a gue&s;t arrives unexpectedly, their readie&s;t and be&s;t di&s;h is new chee&s;e, fried with butter They are not much accu&s;tomed to bread, baked after our manner, but they make cakes of millet, barley, Indian corn, and &s;ometimes of wheat; which they bake, or toa&s;t
<PB N="332" REF="342">
on the hearth every day, for pre&s;ent u&s;e; but wheaten bread is hardly ever &s;een in the cottages of the poor. They make a large provi&s;ion of cabbages, like tho&s;e u&s;ed in Germany; and roots, and all kinds of e&s;culent herbs, which they find in the woods, or in the fields, &s;erve them for a cheap and &s;alutary diet. But garlic, and &s;halots, are the food mo&s;t univer&s;ally plea&s;ing to that people, next to roa&s;t meat, which is their mo&s;t luxurious di&s;h. It is rea&s;onable to think, that the con&s;tant u&s;e of the&s;e plants, corrects, in part, the bad quality of their water, and contributes to keep them long, healthy, and robu&s;t. Nothing is more common in that country, than to &s;ee very old men &s;trong, active, and lively, to an extraordinary degree; and this, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> I am inclined to think, is partly owing to the garlic, and their regular vegetable diet.</P>
<P>A Morlach, in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, has no other bed than a coar&s;e blanket, made of goat's hair, and of Turki&s;h manufacture; very few of the riche&s;t people in the country have &s;uch a piece of luxurious furni|ture, as a bed after our fa&s;hion; and, there are not many, who have &s;o much as a bed&s;tead; which, how|ever, when they happen to get made in their rough manner, they &s;leep in between two great hair blankets, without &s;heets, or any other bedding. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants content them&s;elves with the
<PB N="333" REF="343">
bare ground, wrapt in the u&s;ual blanket, and only &s;ometimes a little &s;traw under it. But in &s;ummer they choo&s;e to &s;leep in the open air; perhaps, to be delivered from the dome&s;tic in&s;ects. Their hou&s;e|hold furniture con&s;i&s;ts of a few, and &s;imple articles; &s;uch as &s;hepherds and pea&s;ants, little advanced in arts, require. Their hou&s;es are not often covered with tiles or &s;lates; and, when they have any beams intended to &s;upport a &s;econd floor, the families ward|robe is placed on them; which, it may be imagined, is well provided, where there is &s;o much magnificence; yet, the ladies &s;leep on the floor, even in &s;uch noble hou&s;es. I have been lodged in one of them, &s;ays the Abbe, where &s;everal of the&s;e women were grind|ing corn till pa&s;t midnight; &s;creaming certain diaboli|cal &s;ongs, in the &s;ame place where I was laid to &s;leep; and where ten others were &s;tretched on the ground, and actually fa&s;t a&s;leep, notwith&s;tanding their frightful vociferation. The Morlacchi, who have little or no corre&s;pondence with &s;ea-towns, and are at a great di&s;tance from them, have &s;eldom any other hou&s;es, cottages covered with &s;traw, or zimble; for &s;o they call a kind of laths, u&s;ed in&s;tead of tiles. The ani|mals inhabit the &s;ame cottage, divided from the ma&s;ters, by a &s;light partition, made of twigs, and plai&s;tered with clay, and the dung of cattle; the walls of the cottage are either of the &s;ame materials,
<PB N="334" REF="344">
or of large &s;tones, laid one upon another, without cement.</P>
<P>The fire-place &s;tands in the middle of the cottage, and the &s;moke finds its way out at the door; there being rarely any other aperture. Hence, every thing within the&s;e wretched habitations is ornamented with black, and loath&s;ome with &s;moak; not excepting the milk, which forms a great part of their &s;u&s;tenance, and of which they are very liberal to &s;trangers. Their cloaths, per&s;ons, and every thing, in &s;hort, contract the &s;ame &s;moaky &s;mell. The whole family &s;its round this fire-place, in the cold &s;ea&s;on; and, when they have &s;upped, lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep in the &s;ame place where they &s;at at &s;upper; for, in every cottage they have not even benches to &s;it, and to lie upon. They burn butter in&s;tead of oil in their lamps; but, for the mo&s;t part, they u&s;e pieces of cleft fir, in lieu of candles; the &s;moke of which, &s;ometimes tinges their mu&s;tachoes curiou&s;ly. A very few rich Morlacchi have hou&s;es in the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, with &s;tools, and &s;ome few of our moveables; but, in ge|neral, the riche&s;t of them live but a &s;avage kind of life. Although they have no idea of cleanline&s;s in their habitations, yet, in one re&s;pect, they are nicer than we are; nor do they fail to reproach us on that account, and call us barbarous, and bea&s;tly; and, it is a real fact, that no man, nor woman, of that nation,
<PB N="335" REF="345">
let the di&s;order be ever &s;o &s;evere, or painful, was ever known to ea&s;e nature in the cottage; even dying per&s;ons are carried out to perform that operation in the open air; and, if a &s;tranger &s;hould, through igno|rance, or contempt, pollute their hou&s;e in that man|ner, even in the night, he would &s;carcely e&s;cape with his life, and certainly not without very ill treatment.</P>
<P>A Morlacco cloaths him&s;elf with great plainne&s;s and economy. The <HI>opanke</HI> &s;erve for &s;hoes, both in men and women; and under them they wear a &s;hort woollen &s;tocking, which reaches above the ankle, and joins to the breeches, whereby all the leg is covered. The breeches are of coar&s;e white &s;erge, and they draw them tight about the wai&s;t, like a pur&s;e, by means of a woollen &s;tring. Their &s;hirt is very &s;hort, and over it they wear a &s;hort doublet; and, in winter, they add a kind of &s;hort cloak, made of very coar&s;e red cloth. On their head, they wear a red cloth cap, and above it, a &s;ort of cylindrical turban. They &s;have their heads, leaving only a &s;mall tuft behind, like the Poles and Tartars. They bind their loins with a &s;trong reticular fillet of woollen yarn, and &s;ometimes of &s;ilk; and in this fillet, or bandage, and their breeches, they carry all their nece&s;&s;ary im|plements; &s;uch as one or two pi&s;tols &s;tuck in behind, and before; a very large knife, with the handle of bra&s;s, &s;et round with fal&s;e &s;tones. This knife is often made
<PB N="336" REF="346">
fa&s;t to a light bra&s;s chain, rolled about the bandages; and near it is placed a horn, with grea&s;e for their arms, or for them&s;elves. Next follows a little bag, with their tinder-box, and money, if they have any; and then their tobacco in a dried bladder. The to|bacco pipe is placed behind, the reed &s;tuck in below their &s;hirt, and the bowl appears without. No Mor|lacco ever goes out of doors without his gun upon his &s;houlders. The chiefs of the nation, however, are better dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Morlacchi have their ru&s;tic a&s;&s;emblies, e&s;|pecially in hou&s;es where there are &s;everal young women; and, in the&s;e, the memory of ancient na|tional &s;tories is perpetuated. A mu&s;ician always at|tends the&s;e meetings, and &s;ings the old <HI>Pi&s;me,</HI> or &s;ongs, accompanying them with an in&s;trument, called <HI>guzla,</HI> which has but one &s;tring, compo&s;ed of many hor&s;e hairs. The tune, to which the&s;e heroic &s;ongs are &s;ung, is extremely mournful, and monotonous; be&s;ides, they bring the &s;ound a little through the no&s;e, which agrees perfectly well with their in&s;trument; the ver&s;es, of the mo&s;t ancient traditional &s;ongs, are of ten &s;yl|lables, not rhymed. Their poetry does not want &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion; but the &s;malle&s;t ray of imagi|nation rarely appears in it; and the little that is at|tempted, is &s;eldom happy. Yet the&s;e &s;ongs have great effect on the minds of the hearers, who are at
<PB N="337" REF="347">
pains to get them by heart. A Morlacco will travel along the de&s;ert mountains &s;inging, e&s;pecially in the night time, the actions of ancient Sclavi kings, and barons, or &s;ome tragic event; and, if another happens to be travelling on a neighbouring mountain, he re|peats the &s;ame ver&s;e, when the other has &s;ung it; and this alternation continues, as long as they can hear each other. A loud and long howl, which is an Oh! barbarou&s;ly modulated, con&s;tantly precedes the ver&s;e; the words of which are pronounced rapidly, almo&s;t without any modulation, which is all re&s;erved for the la&s;t &s;yllable, and ends with another long howl, by way of trill, rai&s;ed louder and louder, while the breath la&s;ts.</P>
<P>Although the Morlacchi u&s;ually &s;ing their ancient &s;ong, yet other poetry is not altogether extingui&s;hed among them; and their mu&s;icians, after &s;ing|ing an ancient piece, accompanied with the <HI>guzla,</HI> &s;ometimes fini&s;h it with &s;ome extempore ver&s;es, in prai&s;e of the per&s;onage by whom they are temployed; and, &s;ome of them are capable of &s;ing|ing extempore during the whole entertainment; al|ways accompanying the voice with the <HI>guzla.</HI> There is al&s;o &s;ome written poetry among them, when the memory of a &s;ignal event happens to be pre&s;erved in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="348">Their games and diver&s;ions, almo&s;t all, con&s;i&s;t in trials of &s;trength or agility; &s;uch as leaping, running, or flinging a large heavy &s;tone. They dance to the &s;ound of the bagpipe, and the voice of their &s;ingers; a favourite dance, which they call <HI>kolo,</HI> or circle, which &s;oon turns into <HI>&s;kocci gofi;</HI> that is, high dancing. All the dancers, men and women, taking hold of each others hands, form a circle, and turn &s;lowly round, to the har&s;h notes of the in&s;trument. Then the circle changes its form, &s;ometimes into an elip&s;is, and &s;ometimes a &s;quare, according as the dance becomes more animated; and, at la&s;t, transforms it&s;elf into the mo&s;t violent &s;prings and leaps, in which the women al&s;o join, and the whole becomes wild confu&s;ion. The Morlacchi have an incredible tran|&s;port for this rude dance; for neither the fatigues of the day, nor a long journey, nor hunger it&s;elf, can detain them from it, or from continuing &s;everal hours, with very little intermi&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch a violent exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>It happens frequently enough, that inflammatory fevers are the immediate con&s;equences of the&s;e vio|lent dances ju&s;t mentioned; in which ca&s;e, and in all others of the like nature, the Morlacchi do not apply to the phy&s;ician; becau&s;e, happily for them there is none of that profe&s;&s;ion among them, but they cure them&s;elves after their own way. A large draught
<PB N="339" REF="349">
of a &s;pirituous liquor, which they call <HI>rakia,</HI> is commonly their fir&s;t medicinal portion; and, that, if it does not effectuate the cure, they repeat the do&s;e, together with a large infu&s;ion of pepper, or gunpowder. After this, they cover them&s;elves up, in winter; or lie down in the hotte&s;t rays of the &s;un, if in &s;ummer, <HI>to &s;weat the illne&s;s,</HI> as they expre&s;s it. Their cure for agues is more methodical; the fir&s;t and &s;econd day they take a gla&s;s of wine, in which, as much pepper as they can take up between their finger and thumb, has been infu&s;ed for &s;everal hours; and, the third or fourth day the do&s;e is doubled. Their remedy for ob&s;tructions is to lay a large flat &s;tone on the &s;ick per&s;on's belly; and, for the rheumati&s;m, they u&s;e a mo&s;t violent friction; which, at lea&s;t, renders the patient's back quite livid, and often &s;trips off the &s;kin. Sometimes they apply a red hot &s;tone, wrapt in red rags, for rheumatic pains; and, they are u&s;ed to drink a great quantity of vinegar, to recover their appetite, after a long &s;eries of fevers. But, the la&s;t remedy of all, which is taken only in de&s;perate ca&s;es, is &s;ugar, when they can find any; and, they put it into the mouths of dying per&s;ons, to make them pa&s;s into the other world with le&s;s bitterne&s;s. <HI>Cripte|mus,</HI> and <HI>Chamoephitis,</HI> are u&s;ed for articular pains; and, they frequently apply hor&s;e-leeches to the &s;welled, or aching parts. They apply a red ochrous earth, frequently found in the fields, as the be&s;t remedy for
<PB N="340" REF="350">
excoriations, or wounds. They are very dexterous in &s;etting di&s;located, or broken bones, without having &s;tudied o&s;teology, like our &s;urgeons; who, notwith|&s;tanding more frequently lame us, by the rules of art. They perform phlebotomy with an in&s;trument like that u&s;ed for hor&s;es; and yet, there is no example of any bad accident happening by that coar&s;e ope|ration.</P>
<P>The family weeps and howls over the dead, while they lie in the hou&s;e, and when they are carried out to be buried, much in the &s;ame manner as the wild Iri&s;h do with us. But the Morlacchi have &s;everal cu&s;toms peculiar to them&s;elves on the&s;e occa|&s;ions; &s;uch as whi&s;pering in the ear of the dead per&s;on, and giving expre&s;s commi&s;&s;ions for the other world. After this ceremony is fini&s;hed, the body is covered with a white cloth, and carried to church; where the lamentations begin again, and the prai&s;es of the de|cea&s;ed are &s;ung, by the relations, or others appointed for that purpo&s;e, weeping. After the corp&s;e is buried, the whole company, together with the curate, returns to the hou&s;e; where there is a &s;trange mixture of fea&s;t|ing and lamentation. The men let their beards grow a long time, in &s;ign of mourning: a cu&s;tom derived from the Jews, as is that of unleavened bread purifi|cations, and &s;everal others. Violet, or blue coloured caps, are al&s;o the mark of mourning. The women
<PB N="341" REF="351">
wear black, or blue handkerchiefs; and cover all the red of their garments with &s;omething black. During the fir&s;t year, the Morlach women go, every holiday, to renew their lamentations; &s;trewing flowers, and wet herbs, upon the grave. And, if nece&s;&s;arily de|tained from that vi&s;it, they, next time, make a formal excu&s;e to the dead, giving a minute account of the cau&s;e of their neglect. They al&s;o frequently a&s;k news about the other world, and propo&s;e many curious interrogations. All the&s;e ceremonies are &s;ung in a kind of ver&s;e, in a doleful tone; and, &s;ometimes, the girls accompany the women, in order to learn the&s;e funeral arts; and form, altogether, a concert truly di&s;mal.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Venetian I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the i&s;lands of the Quarnaro, which, be|tween great and &s;mall, are more than twenty in number, the i&s;land of Veglia is certainly the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, for the ancient date of its being in|habited; the number of people it contains; the &s;in|gularity of its &s;ituation; the amenity of the country; the variety and riches of its commodities; and, finally, for the productions of the fo&s;&s;il kingdom. The ancient Greek geographers knew it by the name of <HI>Curicta,</HI> which was al&s;o adapted by the Latins. Few con&s;iderable i&s;lands are &s;ituated &s;o near the main land as this; being divided from the coa&s;t of Li|burnia by a channel, &s;carcely a quarter of a mile broad. It is of an irregular figure; and has &s;everal promontories that &s;tretch far into the &s;ea. Its circuit is about ninety-five miles; the length of it is thirty; and its greate&s;t breadth about fourteen.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="353">The whole i&s;land contains about 15,000 inhabi|tants, of which 1,500 live in the capital. There are a great many cattle in this i&s;land; and particularly hor&s;es of that &s;mall, &s;trong, and &s;prightly breed, well known in Italy, and much u&s;ed for riding hor&s;es. The cattle and hor&s;es make an article of trade in this i&s;land, though not every year of equal importance. The oxen are &s;mall and weak; the number of &s;heep, on this i&s;land, may be about 50,000; but their wool is not in much e&s;teem. They have hardly corn enough for four months provi&s;ion; but, in recom|pence, they make about 24,000 barrels of wine, for exportation. Their wine is of excellent quality. The fire-wood &s;ent yearly to Venice, amounts to about 5,000 &s;equins. Salt-fi&s;h is al&s;o an article of &s;ome importance.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent capital, which bears the &s;ame name with the i&s;land, is &s;ituated on the very &s;pot where the ancient <HI>Curicta</HI> &s;tood; as appears by the many re|mains of columns and engraved &s;tone in the walls and &s;treets. It is ill-built, and full of rubbi&s;h, and ruined hou&s;es. In &s;ummer time, there is often a want of good water, to drink; and, the Scirocco wind pre|dominates.</P>
<P>The Doge of Venice cannot attend to petty com|plaints of the clergy; and the mini&s;ters, appointed
<PB N="344" REF="354">
for that purpo&s;e, are often more apt to profit bythe di&s;order, than to remove it radically. A prie&s;t, for example, accu&s;ed of defloration, has only to pay 50 <HI>paoli</HI> for a full acquittal, according to the law of the i&s;land. There goes a &s;tory of a prie&s;t, who, being come to pay his penalty, after he had laid down his 50 <HI>paoli,</HI> went on, counting out more; and, being a&s;ked why he did &s;o, an&s;wered, "I pay before|hand for the next defloration, of which I &s;hall be ac|cu&s;ed."</P>
<P>The Greek &s;uper&s;titions &s;ub&s;i&s;t almo&s;t all over the i&s;land; though there is no clergy of the Greek rite in it. In one of the principal villages, the prie&s;ts, who have the charge of collecting the tithes, and of guarding the church, are obliged to &s;leep under a lodge, open on all &s;ides, and contiguous to the &s;teeple, from St. <HI>George</HI>'s day to Michaelmas; that they may be ready, at any hour, to drive away the &s;torms of hail, by ringing of bells; and, if the &s;torm continues, it is their duty to go out into the open air, bare-headed, to conjure it. Perhaps, no where are the bells more frequently rung than here; and no &s;teeple is more frequently &s;truck with lightening.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the pea&s;ants, over all the i&s;land, is of a coar&s;e kind of cloth, of a black colour; and, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in a ca&s;&s;ock, and a pair of long and wide
<PB N="345" REF="355">
breeches, which reach down to the middle of the leg; a number of people, a&s;&s;embled together, in this mourning kind of habit, forms a melancholy &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>Of the I&s;land of Pago, the ancient geographers have left us no de&s;cription; though its form, extent, and rich produce de&s;erved it. This i&s;land is extended from north and &s;outh, over again&s;t maritime Croatia, or the mountain Morlacca. It is about fifty miles long; its breadth is unequal. One particular cir|cum&s;tance di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all the other i&s;lands of the Adriatic, which is a large internal &s;alt-water lake, fifteen miles long, from &s;outh to north, into which the &s;ea enters by a canal, not above a quarter of a mile broad.</P>
<P>The climate of the i&s;land of Pago is the &s;ame as that of the mountain Morlacca; in winter, dreadfully cold; in &s;ummer, &s;corching hot. The air is gene|rally darkened by the &s;alt mi&s;t, that is rai&s;ed by the colli&s;ion of the waves in the narrow channel of Mor|lacca, altogether flanked by &s;teep naked rocks. The lake it&s;elf is not calm in the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on, and &s;o far from being a harbour is tempe&s;tuous, and un&s;afe. The inhabitants of the city cannot go out of their hou&s;es during the violence of the wind; and are obliged to have the roofs defended, all round, by large &s;tones. Tho&s;e, who have been there in the
<PB N="346" REF="356">
winter time, &s;peak of it as a Siberia, quite covered with &s;now and ice; and always expo&s;ed to the cold north wind. I, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> who was there in the hot &s;ea&s;on, thought it equal to the mo&s;t &s;corching parts of the world. The naked rocks, which not only form the organization, but al&s;o the &s;uperficies of almo&s;t all the i&s;land; the narrowne&s;s of the vallies; the reverberation of the water of the lake, generally quite calm in &s;ummer, multiply the heat &s;o prodigi|ou&s;ly among tho&s;e &s;tones, that the vines, which are planted all round the lake, ripen the grapes by the beginning of Augu&s;t: and the few other products, that grow there, anticipate the u&s;ual time of maturity in the &s;ame manner. The meteors are exceedingly irregular in the &s;ummer time; &s;udden whirlwinds are frequent, and heavy &s;howers of rain; the la&s;t are hurtful to the inhabitants of one part of the i&s;land, and favourable to the cultivation of the oppo&s;ite end.</P>
<P>The banks of the interior marine lake are almo&s;t all cultivated with vines; and, particularly near the city of Pago, and the &s;alt pits, at the &s;outh end of the lake. The part of the i&s;land, under the juri&s;|diction of Pago, produces about forty thou&s;and bar|rels of good wine, and about two thou&s;and of <HI>Rakia,</HI> one year with another. The great quantity of &s;age, and other odoriferous plants, with which the i&s;land is covered, furni&s;hes excellent food for bees; and
<PB N="347" REF="357">
the honey forms no incon&s;iderable branch of trade. The &s;ame pa&s;ture, among tho&s;e barren rocks, main|tains a large number of &s;heep and goats; and the wool, which is very bad, and chee&s;e, make a &s;mall article for export. The northern part of the i&s;land is well &s;upplied with water, and has good pa&s;tures on the low grounds; by which means, its black cattle are larger, and better, than on any of the neighbouring i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of Dalmatia.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable product of the i&s;land is &s;alt. In the year 1774, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> they made eight hundred thou&s;and Venetian &s;tavios. Part of the &s;alt-works belongs to the government, and the re&s;t to private proprietors; they are meliorated every year; and, for that end, the public lend money to tho&s;e proprietors who want it; and who, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could not make the requi&s;ite improvements. The lagune, on which the &s;alt-works lie, is about four miles long, and half a mile broad.</P>
<P>Many ve&s;tiges of ancient habitation &s;till remain on the i&s;land of Pago, as well as of walled places; which either have been de&s;troyed by the incur&s;ions of ene|mies, or of time. Hi&s;torians &s;ay that the i&s;land was often abandoned by its inhabitants; and, indeed, it is rather to be wondered at, how men ever could re&s;olve to &s;ettle in &s;o wretched a country. The &s;mall number
<PB N="348" REF="358">
of inhabitants, after &s;o many years of peace and tran|quility, under the Venetian government, evidently proves how little the i&s;land is really habitable. The whole number &s;carce amounts to 3,500 inhabitants; which bears no proportion to the extent of ground, if the naked barren hills, that cover almo&s;t the whole, did not account for it. The greate&s;t part of this population lives in the city of Pago, which is &s;aid to contain about 3,000 inhabitants. The &s;mall capital of a de&s;art i&s;land cannot be expected to offer much to the eyes of the curious; and, be&s;ides, it is of recent foundation, having been built by the Venetians, in the year 1468. The plan is well under&s;tood, and the &s;treets are large and &s;trait, which generally is not the ca&s;e in the other cities of Dalmatia, Zara alone excepted.</P>
<P>The difficulty of acce&s;s to this city, and the ill ac|commodations, make it little frequented by &s;trangers. Hence the inhabitants are as wild and unpoli&s;hed, as if they were at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and the commerce of polite people. The gentry, who pretend to &s;hew their manners different from the vulgar, are truly grote&s;que figures, both in their dre&s;s, behaviour, and in&s;olent preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the people of Pago live by working in the &s;alt-pits, and have a comfortable &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence,
<PB N="349" REF="359">
regularly paid by government; it is there|fore a very important circum&s;tance for the inhabitants of this city to have a dry &s;ummer; and, hence the ignorant vulgar look upon rain as a mi&s;chief brought upon the country by force of witchcraft. In con&s;e|quence of this idea, they elect a friar to exerci&s;e the meteors, and keep the rain off the i&s;land. If, not|with&s;tanding the poor friar's endeavours, the &s;ummer happens to be rainy, he lo&s;es his reputation, and his bread; but, if two or three dry &s;ea&s;ons follow &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, he meets with great reverence and ad|vantage.</P>
<P>To conclude the account of this city; I found not here, &s;ays Abbe <HI>Fortis,</HI> a &s;ingle medal, nor in|&s;cription, nor M. S. nor a man of good &s;en&s;e, in all the i&s;land; every body is intere&s;ted in the &s;alt-pits; and whoever talks not of &s;alt, is not regarded.</P>

<P>Savoy may be reputed a nur&s;ery of heroes, being &s;eque&s;tered from all incentives to luxury and &s;oft|ne&s;s, on account of the lofty barren mountains, and enormous rocks, that overrun the greate&s;t part of it, and are known to produce only &s;ome mo&s;s and &s;hrubs. Box trees, indeed, grow in &s;uch plenty, that brooms are made of them. The vallies between the mountains yield &s;ome grain, but are rather more laid out for pa&s;ture: the indu&s;try of the inhabitants has made the be&s;t improvements, in the mountains them&s;elves, which the &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> could admit of.</P>
<P>There is &s;o much rocky and barren ground in Savoy, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> particularly towards mount Cenis, that the lea&s;t &s;pot of earth, capable of pro|ducing corn, or gra&s;s, does not lie uncultivated; and, all through the country, one or the other may be &s;een growing on the &s;lope of the rocks, wherever the pea&s;ant can find a little piece of flat &s;urface, with
<PB N="352" REF="364">
a depth of &s;oil &s;ufficient to admit of vegetation. Many of the&s;e pieces of land are not bigger, and many are le&s;s, than the hall of an old Engli&s;h country man&s;ion; but, in &s;ome places, they are numerous; and, by hanging one over the other, from the top to the bottom of the hill, make a very picture&s;que &s;cene. In a conver&s;ation I had with a monk, an inhabitant of this country, I turned my eyes towards two or three of the&s;e little patches of cultivated ground, en|compa&s;&s;ed with a mon&s;trous extent of barren rock; and, feeling &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for the &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;ery of the inhabitants, I opened my mouth to &s;ay &s;ome|thing on the &s;ubject; but he, imagining I meant a pa|negyric on the &s;tate of this agriculture, interrupted me with great eagerne&s;s, in a manner which &s;hews the providential and blind partiality, that almo&s;t every individual feels for his native country. <HI>Aye, God be prai&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we are not like other nations, dependent for our food upon a due cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons; for whether the rains or drought prevails, we are always a&s;&s;ured of our harve&s;t; we have &s;o many crops on the bottom, the middle, and the &s;ummits of the mountains, that when &s;ome fail, the others nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceed.</HI> To have en|deavoured to awake him out of his plea&s;ing dreams, and open his eyes, &s;ays <HI>Sharp,</HI> I mu&s;t have been a brute.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="365">Towards the barren parts of the mountains, every one of the pea&s;ants is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall quantity of ground, which he cultivates for the maintenance of his family; and there is hardly an in&s;tance of a man's labouring by the day in the&s;e parts. It is &s;up|po&s;ed, there are generally &s;ixty thou&s;and Savoyards ab&s;ent from home during the winter; for, tho&s;e who have no vineyards, as &s;oon as they have got in their little harve&s;t, and &s;own their &s;eed, &s;et out, &s;ome for France, &s;ome for Italy, and others for different parts, to procure a &s;mall pittance, which they bring home to their wives and children. Ju&s;t after harve&s;t, it is amazing to &s;ee the prodigious number of &s;mall &s;tacks of corn, &s;pread over the whole face of the country; in &s;ome places, like haycocks in a meadow; but this partition of the land into &s;uch an infinity of &s;mall farms, accounts for the appearance; be&s;ides, the pea|&s;ants make their &s;tacks &s;mall, from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that if they were larger, the corn in that climate would become di&s;coloured and mu&s;ty.</P>
<P>The wine, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> is not contemptible; and, in &s;ome parts of their vallies, there is &s;uch a good breed of cattle, that mo&s;t of the oxen in Piedmont, and the Milane&s;e, are &s;ent from Savoy. Mules al&s;o are bred for exportation: but all this is incon&s;i|derable in proportion to the greate&s;t part of the country, which is occupied by immen&s;e mountains.
<PB N="354" REF="366">
Some of the highe&s;t, are <HI>Les glacieres,</HI> or ice moun|tains; and <HI>les montagnes maudites,</HI> or the diabolical mountains, in Faucigny, the perpendicular height of the latter, twelve thou&s;and feet. Maurienne, in par|ticular, is remarkable for prodigious mountains, which make part of the Alps. The mo&s;t famous is mount Cenis; the road from Savoy to Piedmont being cut over it. On the Lanebourg &s;ide the height is about three miles along a &s;erpentine road; where the mules, carrying the pa&s;&s;engers and baggage, may be left to them&s;elves, without any apprehen&s;ion of danger; the&s;e creatures being very cautious and &s;ure-footed. On the top of the mountain &s;tands a hou&s;e, called <HI>La Ra|ma&s;&s;e;</HI> from whence, in winter-time, the de&s;cent to Lanebourg is performed on &s;ledges, within &s;even or eight minutes; though from Lanebourg, up the moun|tain to La Rama&s;&s;e, takes up a full hour. On the &s;ummit of the mountain, encompa&s;&s;ed by others &s;till higher, and perpetually covered with &s;now, is a plain, or, more properly, a valley; and in it a lake of about three miles in circumference. Here, among other fi&s;h, are trouts, of eighteen pounds weight and up|wards, of a mo&s;t delicious flavour. It is rented at near a hundred pounds &s;terling a year. In the middle it is &s;aid to be &s;carce fathomable.</P>
<P>The borders of this lake gave occa&s;ion to a plea|&s;ant reply made by <HI>Sherlock.</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e moun|tains, &s;aid he, with a young Frenchman, who was pa&s;|&s;ionately
<PB N="355" REF="367">
fond of the Italian mu&s;ic; when we arrived at our inn, on the middle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Alps, we went to take a walk, on the &s;ide of a &s;mall lake, &s;urrounded by a delightful wood; <HI>"Parbleu,"</HI> &s;aid he, "Nature is very ridiculous here"&mdash;"Ha," replied I, "this is &s;ome|thing new; I have often heard of the caprices of na|ture, but you are the fir&s;t who have found her ridi|culous."&mdash; "Li&s;ten," &s;aid he; (the wood re&s;ounded with the &s;ong of nightingales, and the lake was full of frogs that were croaking) "have you ever heard &s;uch a concert."&mdash;"Yes, I have heard &s;ome Frenchmen, and Italian women &s;ing together." He took the joke in good part, &s;ays <HI>Sherlock,</HI> and we laughed at the ri|diculou&s;ne&s;s of nature, and the opera-&s;ingers at Paris.</P>
<P>This lake receives a continual &s;upply from the ad|jacent &s;nowy mountains; and out of it flows a rivulet, by &s;ome called Semar, and by others St. Nicholas; which, falling precipitately down the mountains, runs into the river Dora, near Su&s;a. Clo&s;e by it, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> &s;tood a little palace, built in 1619, by Duke <HI>Victor Amadoeus,</HI> only for the entertainment of his bride, <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in her journey through France; on which occa&s;ion he al&s;o exhibited, on this lake, a &s;ea-fight.</P>
<P>At the inn called the Grande Croix, from a wooden cro&s;s near it, the boundary between Savoy and Pied|mont, there is another de&s;cent, from a plain, &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="356" REF="368">
with mountains, called <HI>La plaine de St. Ni|cholas.</HI> Here the de&s;cent begins to grow &s;o &s;tony and rugged, that the carriers of chairs, in which the tra|vellers ride, jump down, from one large &s;tone to ano|ther, as from &s;o many high &s;teps. Along this &s;teep de&s;cent, near Novale&s;e, in Piedmont, are three or four places, where the path, on the brink of the terri|ble precipices, is very narrow; and &s;o wa&s;hed away by the water, that half the chair hangs over the precipice; but the&s;e dangerous places extend not above a few paces. In this road to Novale&s;e are two very lofty cataracts; one of which mu&s;t be cro&s;&s;ed over. The higher mountains are perpetually covered with &s;now and ice; and tho&s;e who go in &s;earch of rock-cry&s;tal, or lay &s;prings for chamois, as on the very high mountain of <HI>Bon ai&s;e,</HI> near Lanebourg, often expo&s;e their lives to imminent danger. The&s;e chains of high mountains occa&s;ion the roads, in Savoy, to be very bad, di&s;agreeable, and dangerous; e&s;pecially as huge ma&s;&s;es of &s;now, or fragments of rock, roll fre|quently into them. The mountain of <HI>Plain jou,</HI> near Pa&s;&s;y, in Faucigny, in 1751 became a volcano.</P>
<P>Some men of learning, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> have thought the rock-cry&s;tal, which is found in great quantities on the&s;e mountains, to be generated from ice. Not only <HI>Seneca, Pliny,</HI> and St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> among the ancients; but al&s;o <HI>Cardan,</HI> and <HI>Pere Fournier,</HI> among the mo|derns, adopt this tran&s;mutation of ice; but, not to
<PB N="357" REF="369">
mention, &s;ays the &s;ame writer, that the like origin may, with equal rea&s;on, be a&s;cribed to the diamond, the chy&s;olite, the topaz, and other gems; the favourers of &s;uch an hypothe&s;is mu&s;t either not have known, or not have recollected, that cry&s;tal is a native of very hot countries; &s;uch as of the i&s;land Cyprus&punc; and &s;eve|ral of the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia; but, from this no|tion, it would follow, that large mountains of clear cry&s;tal might be found about Nova Zembla.</P>
<P>The perpendicular height of the above mountains, from the &s;urface of the lake of Geneva, is computed to be, at lea&s;t, 2,000 fathoms, or, above two Engli&s;h miles; and the &s;urface, of the lake of Geneva, is 426 fathoms above the level of the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>On the left-hand, between Fertiere and Novale&s;e, in the de&s;cent from mount Cenis&punc; is the mountain of Rochemelon; accounted the highe&s;t of all the Italian Alps. The a&s;cent up this mountain is a day's jour|ney; a &s;teep valley running between that and mount Cenis. At fir&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> I could &s;ee clearly up to its very &s;ummit; but, within le&s;s than half a quarter of an hour, it was quite involved in a cloud. The&s;e changes are &s;o frequent, that, after all the trouble of getting up this prodigious acclivity, one may happen to come there at an unlucky time, and be obliged to wait for fair weather to come down again; but, in a clear &s;ky, the toil mu&s;t be acknowledged to be well
<PB N="358" REF="370">
rewarded, by an a&s;toni&s;hing pro&s;pect over the Mila|ne&s;e, the Trevigiana, Venice, &amp;c. Some have ima|gined this to be the mountain, from whence <HI>Hannibal</HI> encouraged his army, by a view of the &s;plendor and fertility of Italy. A mu&s;quet, fired from the top of this mountain, makes but a very &s;aint report; like that of the breaking of a &s;tick, owing to the light|ne&s;s and thinne&s;s of the air. It is &s;aid that a &s;tatue of <HI>Jupiter</HI> formerly &s;tood upon the top of Rochemelon; perhaps it has been obliged to give way to one of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which is &s;et up there; ma&s;s is annually &s;aid at this place, on the 5th of Augu&s;t. Thou&s;ands of people repair thither, from the neighbouring countries, either out of devotion, or in compliance with an in|junction of the church; climbing over ice and &s;now, and &s;pending, at lea&s;t, one night upon the mountain.</P>
<P>The chief rivers in this country are, the Rhone, which flows out of the lake of Geneva; and, on that &s;ide, &s;eparates it from France. Into it run the follow|ing rivers: 2. The Arvo; which ri&s;es in Faucigny, has a mixture of gold in its &s;and, and, near Geneva, empties it&s;elf into the Rhone. 3. Les Su&s;&s;es; the &s;ources of which are in Genevois; and fall into the Rhone, not far fron Sei&s;el; the latter being increa&s;ed by the Seran. 4. The I&s;ere; which runs at the foot of mount I&s;eran; among others, it receives the river Arc, which likewi&s;e ri&s;es in the Alps. The Arc
<PB N="359" REF="371">
having a great many falls, is very rapid, and full of foam.</P>
<P>Of lakes, the chief are tho&s;e of Annecy, in Gene|vois; and 2. Bourget, in Savoy; which are properly &s;o called. The la&s;t, has a fi&s;h unknown in other coun|tries, called Lavarette; frequently weighing four or five pounds; and, as a delicacy, never fails bringing a good price at Chambery. Here are al&s;o &s;ome re|markable &s;prings; as the hot-bath at Aix. Not far from Bourget-lake is a &s;pring, which ri&s;es and falls with &s;ome noi&s;e, but not at &s;tated and regular times; after Ea&s;ter this alteration is often perceptible about &s;ix times in an hour; and, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, not above once or twice; it i&s;&s;ues from a rock, and is called <HI>la fontaine de merveille.</HI> Of a different kind are the &s;prings of this country, which &s;ometimes throw up more or le&s;s water; and ri&s;e, or fall, according to the alteration in the Rhone; but not by &s;uch &s;udden and frequent fluxes and re fluxes as in the <HI>fontaine de merveille.</HI></P>
<P>Chambery is the capital of Savoy; and &s;ituate on the river Lei&s;e, in a plea&s;ant valley, about one day's journey from Geneva. This town is not large, and its chief &s;trength is in it walls. It is the &s;eat of the high court of ju&s;tice, or parliament of Savoy; and the re&s;idence of the noble&s;&s;e. Here are no antiqui|ties
<PB N="360" REF="372">
to be &s;een, nor any thing curious. Abb&egrave; <HI>Richard</HI> has &s;aid more in favour of the architecture of the church than it merits. They &s;hew, with great vene|ration, a little chapel, in which the <HI>Sainte Suaire</HI> was depo&s;ited; &s;ince removed to Turin. Upon the wall hangs a long li&s;t of relics, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ixty different articles; &s;uch as St. <HI>John</HI>'s reed, that <HI>was &s;haken by the wind in the de&s;art;</HI> two nails of the <HI>real cro&s;s;</HI> fragments of &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles' garments. But, fortunately for the <HI>devots</HI> at Chambery, all their precious <HI>realities</HI> have been removed to Turin, and the li&s;t only remains. The old ca&s;tle was deemed im|pregnable, in bow and arrow time, but is now com|manded on every &s;ide. Two thou&s;and people were lodged within its walls in 1736, or 1737, at the mar|riage of the pre&s;ent King of Sardinia, with Madame of Lorrain. The palace is in ruins. There are a few &s;mall pictures in the church of the Jacobins, tolerably well executed. The public walk, admired by <HI>Lal&aacute;nde,</HI> does not an&s;wer his de&s;cription. Here are &s;everal fountains, &s;upplied with excellent water. The hou&s;es make a beggarly appearance, on the out&s;ide particu|larly, as the windows are of paper, and frequently in tatters. In this town there are no fewer than fifteen religious hou&s;es, male and female <HI>communaut&eacute;s,</HI> be|&s;ides one convent of Je&s;uits; who, though con&s;i&s;ting of no more than fourteen or fifteen in number, have a yearly revenue of thirty thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="373">I &s;hall conclude the account of Chambery, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> with an anecdote of a cobler's family. About a quarter of a league from Chambery, a fine <HI>chateau,</HI> ju&s;t built, attracts our notice. The ma&s;ter of it goes by the name of <HI>Jaques Mar,</HI> (for he has no title) and is the &s;on of a cobler. In childhood, leaving his country, he travelled into Spain. Being arrived at Madrid, he had the good fortune to recommend him|&s;elf as a <HI>marmiton</HI> in the Queen's kitchen; when, in proce&s;s of time, he was promoted to be <HI>chef de la cui|&s;inier;</HI> and, at length, <HI>Entrepreneur,</HI> or caterer; in which capacity he had a fixed monthly allowance, to provide victualling for all the royal hou&s;hold. In the mean time, a brother of <HI>Jaques Mar,</HI> who, to &s;eek his fortune in England, had quitted Chambery, died in London; having realized about ten thou&s;and livres a year, which he bequeathed to his brother. Fame, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> does not give &s;o accurate an account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this <HI>Mar,</HI> as of <HI>Jaques.</HI> All that could be learnt was, that he &s;erved a London merchant, who traded on the &s;eas; and that, at length, he became con&s;iderable, and carried on commerce upon his own account. The caterer <HI>Jaques</HI> planned and built the before-mentioned <HI>chateau,</HI> to which he retired, with a yearly income of about two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, at the age of forty-five. His cou&s;in-german continues the family-&s;tall, furni&s;h|ing to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;oles and heels of his neigh|bours,
<PB N="362" REF="374">
with as much humility as if there had been no <HI>chateau</HI> in the family.</P>
<P>At Aix, near this city, are &s;ome baths, famous for their medicinal qualities. Two of the &s;prings bur&s;t out of a rock, on the &s;ide of a &s;teep mountain, which are arched over like a grotto. The waters are exce&s;|&s;ive hot. Our guide, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> told us that a Geneva gentleman had but ju&s;t left the town, who was &s;o paralytic, when he entered, as to occa&s;ion his being helped out of his carriage, by five men; in &s;ix weeks after he had u&s;ed the baths, and drank the wa|ters, he got into his coach without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and is re|turned in perfect health to Geneva. One of the &s;prings brings down with it a kind of &s;tuff, or pa&s;te, in flakes; in colour and con&s;i&s;tence not unlike the white of an egg, a little hardened; which flames and burns, when applied to a lighted candle. Curio&s;ity led me to ta&s;te the water, of which, having drank a gla&s;s, with &s;everal flakes in it, I was, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;eized with a &s;ickne&s;s in the &s;tomach. It is u&s;ed in con&s;ump|tions, and all di&s;orders of the brea&s;t. I folded up in a paper &s;ome of the mo&s;t conden&s;ed flakes, and put them into my pocket-book to dry; but an hour or two after, there was not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige to be &s;een; nothing remained but an offen&s;ive &s;mell. The &s;tones, which receive the &s;pray, are covered over with a green coat re&s;embling vitriol; which is applied as an infallible remedy to corns. No doubt it may be endued with
<PB N="363" REF="375">
many &s;uperior virtues, though they have not yet been properly inve&s;tigated. There is another fountain, which &s;upplies a bath built for <HI>Madame Royale;</HI> the water of which is green; and &s;o tran&s;parent as to di&s;|cover the &s;ource, bubbling up through the gravel at the bottom. This water is &s;aid to have the extraor|dinary quality of re&s;toring, in a few hours, to their original fre&s;hne&s;s, all &s;orts of berbs and vegetables, though dried and withered.</P>
<P>Lanebourg is &s;ituated among the mountains, and particularly mount Cenis; which lies &s;o near it, to|wards the South and Ea&s;t, that from the end of No|vember, to the 17th of January, the inhabitants never &s;ee the &s;un; which on that day makes its fir&s;t appear|ance above the tops of the mountains. It is a large village, at the foot of mount Cenis, con&s;i&s;ting of be|tween two and three hundred hou&s;es; which enjoys a number of privileges, and is under excellent regula|tions; they are &s;o happy as to be free from the op|pre&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Seigneur Commandant,</HI> or any other petty tyrant. The only tax they are &s;ubject to is the <HI>Taille;</HI> which amounts nearly to the &s;eventh part of the pro|duce of their lands, and is paid to the king; they are at no other public expence, except the keeping the public roads and bridges pa&s;&s;able. They al&s;o make provi&s;ion for their <HI>cur&eacute;,</HI> and repair the church. They never let their land; as by &s;o doing it would not pro|duce
<PB N="364" REF="376">
them more than two and a half per cent. whereas, by cultivating their little property them&s;elves, they make it yield from ten to thirteen per cent. There are few Lanebourgians who po&s;&s;e&s;s more than twelve, and none more than forty pounds a year. They have but two prie&s;ts, in their village, and no convent. They are remarkably healthy, and long-lived; no phy&s;i|cian being permitted to live at Lanebourg. The &s;im|plicity of their manners, and the purity of their lives, is &s;uch, that it very rarely happens an illegitimate child is produced among&s;t them; but, when &s;uch an event does arrive, immediate marriage, or perpetual exile, mu&s;t en&s;ue. By the vigilance of the <HI>cur&eacute;</HI> and &s;yndics, no per&s;on has ever e&s;caped one or other of the&s;e or|dinances; and they generally prefer the former. Here then &s;ub&s;i&s;ts a community more free from &s;uper&s;tition, than the religion they profe&s;s admits. Content with the produce of their own labours, they are always chearful, always happy; their wants are bounded by the mere nece&s;&s;ary; their riches never reach beyond their means;&mdash;Thus do they defy the vice of avarice, and cha&s;e for ever from their pillow, the cares attend|ant on ambition.</P>
<P>Among the inhabitants of the mountains, in this part of the world, is a very &s;ingular cu&s;tom; as ab&s;urd as it is laughable; I do not know that any writers of travels have mentioned, as I had it on the veracity of
<PB N="365" REF="377">
a gentleman with whom I am acquainted; and who is a native of Savoy. He declares, that being one day on a vi&s;it at a gentleman's hou&s;e; the ma&s;ter of a ca|pital vineyard, where he &s;lept one night, on the moun|tains; two beautiful girls, the daughters of his friend, with a young lady their vi&s;itor, came into his chamber, ju&s;t as he had got out of his bed; and, before he could get any of his cloaths on; and, as they did not &s;hew any di&s;po&s;ition to retire, though he was naked, de|cency led him to jump into his bed again, and cover him&s;elf with the cloaths; thinking they might have &s;omething particular to &s;ay to him. They bur&s;t out a laughing, came up to the bed&s;ide, and attempted to &s;lip down the cloaths. Not being prepared for &s;uch a vi&s;it, and one of them having a rod in her hand, I was at a lo&s;s, &s;ays he, to know what they would be at. As they &s;trived to uncover me, I gathered the cloaths about me, and made all the re&s;i&s;tance I could: but, finding that ineffectual, I determined to laugh with them, and treat them in their own way. Accordingly I jumped out of bed, catched hold of one of them by her petticoats before; treated them in a manner I &s;hould have called rude, at any other time, made &s;ome attempts at indelicacies; and, though I u&s;ed not my tongue, I made good u&s;e of my hands.&mdash;It was a general romp.&mdash;They laughed immoderately; and when tired, fled from me, and thus I got rid of them. Having locked my door, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf; and, tell|ing
<PB N="366" REF="378">
my adventure to a friend that morning, he a&s;&s;ured me they were girls of good character; and their vi&s;it to me was merely a frolick, and de&s;igned to alarm me with the dread of the rod; that, when in bed, had I gathered the cloaths about me before, turned my back to them, and expo&s;ed my breech, they would not have given me a &s;ingle &s;troke; but would have run away laughing. That to frighten their male vi&s;itants with the dread of a whipping, was a cu&s;tomary frolick of unmarried girls of that country; that their whole en|joyment con&s;i&s;ted in the panic they occa&s;ioned, and they called it Alarming the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentleman informs me, that in the Alps there is a plant, which is &s;ought and gathered by moon-light; great quantities of which are tran&s;ported to Paris; but what the plant is, in its nature, he could not learn. That it is di&s;coverable only in moon-light, and then only in certain directions, when it has a bril|liancy peculiar to it&s;elf; and by which it is known. A &s;tep of the &s;earcher, much to the right or left, will lo&s;e him the &s;ight of it.</P>
<P>From Lanebourg to the &s;ummit of mount Cenis is a league, which the climbing of takes up a full hour; the two leagues, from thence to La Grande Croix, are rid in an hour and a half, being over very fine turf; here commences a declivity, of two leagues

more, to Novale&s;e; which is at the foot of mount Cenis, on the Italian &s;ide.</P>
<P>In winter, when the &s;now is on the ground, the plain on the top of mount Cenis is cro&s;&s;ed in a &s;ledge, drawn by a hor&s;e or mule. The de&s;cent, from La Grande Croix to Novale&s;e, mu&s;t, at all times, and even in winter, be made in chairs; the large &s;tones, the winding ways full of holes, and the dangerous pre|cipices, not admitting the u&s;e of &s;ledges. But the de&s;cent, from mount Cenis to Lanebourg, is performed in the&s;e machines; which go with &s;uch rapidity, as almo&s;t to take away the breath. The&s;e &s;ledges hold only two, the traveller, and the guide who &s;its forward &s;teering with a &s;tick. On each &s;ide he has an iron chain; which he drops like an anchor, either to &s;lacken the cour&s;e of the &s;ledge, or to &s;top it. This, like the carrying in chairs, is called <HI>rama&s;&s;ar les gens.</HI> Some travellers, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h and Germans, are &s;o delighted with this expeditious de&s;cent, that they ride up again for the enjoyment of that plea&s;ure a &s;econd time. This is the village where the carriages are taken to pieces to cro&s;s mount Cenis, and from whence travellers are conveyed up the mountains; as well as along the plain, and down the other &s;ide, in chairs. There are mules for tho&s;e who chu&s;e to ride; but the porters, of which there are an hundred kept always in readine&s;s for this employment, are &s;o accu&s;tomed to it,
<PB N="368" REF="381">
that they convey travellers up the mountaain, with le&s;s fatigue to them&s;elves; than tho&s;e not accu&s;tomed to climbing would experience, even in walking up. There are, from &s;ix to ten porters allotted to each chair, according to the weight of the per&s;on to be car|ried, who relieve each other by turns.</P>
<P>A corpulent Engli&s;hman, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,,</HI> who is &s;aid to have weighed five hundred and fifty pouunds, tra|velling here, was obliged to make u&s;e of twelve chairmen.</P>
<P>The chairs, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> are con&s;tructed in the mo&s;t &s;imple and portable manner imaginable. There are two &s;mall bars of wood for arms, and another bar behind, which ri&s;es a little higher than the wai&s;t; and which &s;erves as a &s;upport to the back of the per&s;on in the chair; the &s;eat is matted with bark of trees and ropes, mixed together; which yield to the weight of tho&s;e it conveys. The &s;eat is &s;o near the ground, that there is not the lea&s;t difficulty in &s;tepping out of the chair at plea&s;ure. There are no legs to the&s;e chairs; but, in their room, a board is tied on by ropes to the &s;eat, for the feet to re&s;t on, and the cords as much &s;hortened as can conveniently be; the legs and feet are well &s;upported, being &s;ufficiently rai&s;ed to clear them entirely of any &s;hock from rocky, or uneven ground.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="382">The&s;e chairs are fixed on poles, which appeared to me as long as tho&s;e commonly u&s;ed in Bath, or Lon|don. The chairmen are aided by &s;traps over their &s;houlders, in the manner of tho&s;e in England; and they u&s;e no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance to keep them from &s;lipping, than a few nails drove into the heels of their &s;hoes; and a packthread pa&s;&s;ed from one to the other of them.</P>
<P>Of all di&s;putable matters, between the chairmen and travellers, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> the Syndics are appointed by his Sardinian Maje&s;ty ab&s;olute judges. The&s;e Syndics are magi&s;trates; living, one at Lanebourg, on this &s;ide of the mountain; and the other at Nova|le&s;e, which is &s;ituated at the foot of the mountain, on the &s;ide towards Turin; they are poor men, and not above accepting a &s;mall pre&s;ent for drink; but in|ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power to compel both the mu|leteers, and the chairmen, to attend when any tra|veller arrives. I had an opportunity, when I tra|velled into Italy, &s;ays the above author, of &s;eeing this power exerted; for the chairmen were in the mid&s;t of their harve&s;t, gathering in the produce of their little farms; and would gladly have been excu&s;ed. The Syndic therefore rung the alarum-bell, which &s;ummons was immediately obeyed; and a &s;ufficient number of them &s;elected to tran&s;port me, and my company, the next morning. Their pay is fixed; it is about half-a-crown
<PB N="370" REF="383">
each; and the hire of each mule nearly as much; but, by the ordinance, no mule is obliged to carry above three hundred and fifty pounds weight; &s;o that, if the body of a carriage, or any parcel of lug|gage, &s;hould weigh more, it is in the brea&s;t of the mu|leteers to demand what &s;um they plea&s;e; a privilege they &s;eldom neglect to avail them&s;elves of; and &s;ome|times, with great extortion, to the amount of many guineas. Engli&s;hmen, who take their own coaches, &s;hould provide &s;uch a carriage as may be taken to pieces; which tho&s;e with a perch do not admit of. A man may travel po&s;t through the Alps, if he plea&s;es, but it is attended with &s;ome trouble; and, as I would not advi&s;e any one, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> to drive fa&s;t on the edges of tho&s;e precipices, I &s;hall forbear to enter into a detail on that &s;ubject. <HI>Martin</HI> likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, that this is, almo&s;t, the only road, where it is expedient to travel by vetturins; unle&s;s the &s;tate of a traveller's finances makes it nece&s;&s;ary. He adds, that there is one &s;edan chair at Su&s;a; which may generally be had, by &s;ending notice before-hand, on the other &s;ide of the mountain; and, lately, they have provided other co|vered chairs.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the mountains are &s;mall hou&s;es, which &s;erve the pea&s;ants, in winter, as magazines for their forage; and, in &s;ummer, as dairies; for they make butter and chee&s;e in them, during the three warm
<PB N="371" REF="384">
months. The plain is by no means <HI>&s;ans aucune ine|galit&eacute;,</HI> according to <HI>Lalande,</HI> for there is a great vari|ety of ground; and what is called the plain, is rather a valley, extending along between high mountains, with &s;everal different roads through it; &s;ome of which the mules take, others the porters. The gra&s;s is exceed|ingly thick, &s;hort, and full of flowers; &s;uch as amuran|thoides, or everla&s;tings; &s;ome yellow, others of a fine crim&s;on, and purple. The crowfoot kind is in great abundance, on this mountain; with a number of aromatic, and odoriferous plants. The fore&s;ts, on the &s;ides of mount Cenis, abound with the <HI>Chamois;</HI> a &s;pecies of wild goat, who&s;e fle&s;h is eatable. The pea|&s;ants &s;ell their &s;kins, from eight, to twelve livres each. The blood of the&s;e animals dried, and taken in wine, is e&s;teemed a &s;overeign remedy for the pleuri&s;y. The King of Sardinia is never without the medicine; it being allowed, by the Turin phy&s;icians, to be admi|rable, in many ca&s;es. The chamois are fleet, and ex|tremely &s;hy; concealing them&s;elves in the mo&s;t re|tired parts of the fore&s;t, and in the clefts of rocks, the mo&s;t difficult of acce&s;s. They are &s;o alert, that they bound from rock to rock, and will &s;tand, with all their four feet together, on the mo&s;t pointed of them. Their &s;mell is &s;o exqui&s;ite, that no man can approach them without their perceiving it, except again&s;t the wind; and they have the &s;en&s;e of hearing, in &s;uch perfection, tha it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to get within &s;hot
<PB N="372" REF="385">
of them. The only way of killing them is, by lying in wait behind the bu&s;hes, near their u&s;ual haunts, be|fore break of day, taking care the wind is in your fa|vour. No dog can catch them, not even a grey|hound; for they run directly to the precipices, as their &s;ecurity, near which they are always found; and which are &s;o exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed, and inter&s;ected, that a dog would break his neck, that &s;hould attempt to follow them for any time.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the inn, &s;ituated at the further extre|mity of the plain, is a &s;mall chapel, where tho&s;e, who happen to peri&s;h on the mountains, by cold, lighten|ing, or any other accident, are buried; provided that a ro&s;ary, or any other mark of their catholici&s;m, be found about them. Though this country lies &s;o high, it is not free from thunder; and often &s;uffers by thick clouds unexpectedly &s;ettling upon it, and remaining four, five, or &s;ix days.</P>
<P>They brought us, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> butter; the be&s;t, I think, I ever ta&s;ted; perhaps owing to the many aromatic herbs, the cows find on the plain. They a&s;&s;erted that, for nine months in the year, they keep the cows in their kitchens; in order to make butter for the Engli&s;h travellers.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="386">The de&s;cent from La Grande Croix, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is extremely rapid, for about three hundred yards; and re&s;embles, more than any thing, a broken &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;e; which occa&s;ions the porters to turn &s;o &s;uddenly, with its windings, that the per&s;on in the chair pa&s;&s;es clear over the &s;harp angles, cutting them, as it were, acro&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding the novelty of this manner of travelling, the &s;teepne&s;s of the road, and the velocity with which I de&s;cended, my porters running almo&s;t the whole way, I never once felt my|&s;elf &s;ufficiently frightened to lay hold of the arms of the chair, my attention was &s;o much engaged with the &s;ingularity, and variety of the pro&s;pect below.</P>
<P>In de&s;cending the mountain to Novale&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> one is &s;ometimes obliged to alight, from the&s;e &s;traw chairs. and walk forty or fifty paces; not &s;o much on account of the dangerous road, as from the narrowne&s;s and windings, of the defiles between the rocks, not admitting the u&s;e of the long poles, with which they carry the chairs; the chairmen then either put them under their arms, or carry them on their heads, as they are very light. One of the&s;e pa&s;&s;es is called <HI>les pas de diable, i. e.</HI> "The devil's &s;tride." The path, in &s;ome places, is &s;carce a foot broad; and, on each &s;ide, are very &s;teep precipices. Sometimes our chairmen happened to &s;tumble, and fell down, but it was when there was little danger; and, in &s;uch
<PB N="374" REF="387">
ca&s;es, it is the &s;afe&s;t way to throw them&s;elves on the ground. The&s;e chairmen have a very ea&s;y pace; and, the weather being exceedingly fine, I was ex|tremely well plea&s;ed with this day's expedition. In our cities of Germany, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> what a noi&s;e do the chairmen make, if they are to carry a per&s;on, of any bulk, but &s;ome hundred &s;teps; whil&s;t here our Lanebourg chairmen, without the lea&s;t panting, or re&s;ting, run directly up a mountain, who&s;e height is a good hour,s journey; and then, on the plain above us, and as &s;oon as they have fitted the chairs, which they di&s;patch in a few minutes, carry the company, for two hours together, over a very bad road, making only four pau&s;es, and tho&s;e very &s;hort ones; &s;uch is the effect of cu&s;tom, and a &s;imple diet, to which they al&s;o owe their uncommon longevity; many of them attaining to an hundred years of age. Their u&s;ual drink is milk; and they &s;eldom ta&s;te wine. In my inn at Chambery, I fell into di&s;cour&s;e with a Franci&s;|can, of &s;ome &s;en&s;e and learning, who&s;e con&s;cience would not allow him to be carried by men, as contrary to that equality among the human &s;pecies; which, as he &s;aid, was founded in nature, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, ought to be kept up. Accordingly he travelled on foot, in coming down the mountain to Lanebourg, but a&s;&s;ured me, that another time he &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with tho&s;e &s;cruples; the &s;teepne&s;s of the mountains being &s;uch, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty he could
<PB N="375" REF="388">
keep on his legs. Thus it was not without extreme toil, and danger of his life, that he performed this journey; which yet is much ea&s;ier than to de&s;cend on the other &s;ide of the mountain into Italy; where the rocks are more dangerous, and the road more en|cumbered with their fragments.</P>
<P>To give an idea of this precipice, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> it &s;uf|fices to &s;ay that the de&s;cent is not quite three leagues; and the a&s;cent takes up full five-and-twenty. We were amazed at the rapidity of the Arc, along which the way lies in a&s;cending; but, compared to the little Doria, along which you go down, it only creeps. The fall of the latter is one continual ca&s;cade; di&s;tri|buted by flights of twenty, thirty, fifty feet perpendi|cular height; down which the water precipitates it&s;elf like &s;urf, or very light froth; &s;o that, at &s;ome di&s;tance, it looks like the tran&s;parent clouds, &s;ailing along in a fine &s;ummer's &s;ky.</P>
<P>The road of the de&s;cent is a zig-zag, at very acute angles, contrived and laid out with admirable art, and on it our carriers trotted, as fa&s;t as the be&s;t chairmen in Paris. To &s;horten the way, they would &s;tride over the points of angles; and there we, and our carriages &s;ometimes hung over a precipice, two or three thou|&s;and perpendicular feet in depth. The very mules, when their riders are &s;o venturous, or when left to
<PB N="376" REF="389">
them&s;elves, take the &s;ame bold pace. This de&s;cent is, to travellers, like being driven into Italy by a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Winter is no impediment to travelling over mount Cenis, for the &s;now renders the whole road excellent; and in &s;ome of the rough craggy ways, much better than in &s;ummer; &s;o that there are continually people pa&s;&s;ing into Italy, through the Alps.</P>
<P>A traveller cannot advance far, in this mountainous country, before he perceives many of the natives, of both &s;exes, labouring under that &s;pecies of &s;welled throat, which the common people call a wen, or, the <HI>Deer's-neck;</HI> and the medical people, <HI>Bronchocele:</HI> near mount Cenis very few are exempt from it; and many of the&s;e &s;wellings are &s;o enormous, and of &s;o loath&s;ome an appearance, e&s;pecially in ugly, ragged, half-&s;tarved old women, that the very fight of them turns the &s;tomach. I do not learn, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> that this malady is ever mortal; not but that, &s;ometimes, the tumor compre&s;&s;es the windpipe &s;o much, as to ren|der re&s;piration very difficult; which, at the long-run, though in&s;en&s;ibly, may affect life. It is well known, that in whatever place the inhabitants drink &s;now-water, they are &s;ubject to this di&s;temper. This &s;wel|ling, however, never begins to form till towards two years of age.</P>
