<ITEM>I found the text to have no internal divisions at all, aside from 
a few inconsistently tagged embedded documents (e.g. songs).
Among the features around which it seemed possible to construct
a set of divisions, two stood out:
(1) a detailed table of contents, including section numbers,
section titles, and page numbers; and
(2) a series of numbers at the head of certain paragraphs, usually
accompanied by a marginal indication of topic. There were some
numbered sections without marginal headings, and some marginal
headings that did not correspond to a numbered section.
I chose to organize the book based on (2). I created a new DIV at
each numbered section (plus one at a point where the numbers skipped
one in sequence), and used the number plus the marginal material to
form a head for the div. Similar marginal material that appeared 
opposite the beginnings of paragraphs but did not correspond to
a numbered section was tagged as LABEL and placed at the beginning
of the paragraph in question. Similar material (as well as true
marginal notes) that appeared elsewhere than at a paragraph break
was left as NOTE PLACE="marg". This made for inconsistent treatment
of similar material, but did create a reasonable skeleton on which
to hang the book. And all of the decisions are reversible.

(Potentially, one could also use the table of contents, creating
IDs in the text corresponding to items in the table, and link
the table to the correct spot in the text. But I did not do this.)

* I found a song which was apportioned among speakers, but
the speeches had not been tagged, and the speaker names
had been left as NOTE. I supplied SP tags and re-tagged the
speakers as SPEAKER.

* I found a few odd letter designations at the end of stanzas,
tagged as NOTE. I changed them to MILESTONE, but am not sure
what they signify.

* Turned the account of 'fine shells' into a LIST.

* There are some sections devoted to maths that probably require
more careful attention than I had time to give them (which was 
virtually none).

* Finally, the book challenges our usual rules for text
capture by virtue of its use of very long and elaborate footnotes
(some of them running on for pages). The keyers captured these
using our usual rule for footnotes (i.e., inserted the entire
note in the text at the spot to which it applied, without any
internal page break tags). But this is not an altogether happy
solution, especially since some of the footnotes themselves
have multi-page footnotes, and some of *those* footnotes have  
notes. I could imagine only three solutions: (1) leave the
notes as keyed, using the usual guidelines; (2) violate the
usual guidelines to the extent of inserting PB tags in the notes,
though this does not offer any good way to handle the *return*
to originating page after the close of the note, except by
inserting a PB tag at the very end of the note; or (3) 
remove the long footnotes to a separate DIV, apart from the main
text, and link to them from the main text using REF tags.

First I added P tags to the first paragraph of the multi-paragraph
notes (this had been omitted) and the single-paragraph foot notes
as well. Then went through all of them inserting PB tags,
as in scheme (2) above. Scheme (3), though more radical, might
have been the better choice.

* Also added LG around stand-alone verse at end of volume.

<HEAD>A PREFACE By WAY of DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS book is not addre&s;&s;ed to you, in order to a&s;k your protection for its faults; or in hopes, that &s;uch valuable names at the head of it, may pre|&s;erve it. Things in print mu&s;t &s;tand by their own worth. But it is offered to you, to let the world &s;ee I had that confidence in the goodne&s;s of my de&s;ign in writing it, as to &s;ub|mit it to &s;uch great and impartial judges; and that I believe you will report your opinion in &s;uch a manner, as to procure me the e&s;teem of the virtuous; when you find that my principal intention in this piece, is to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of truth, liberty, and religion, and to advance u&s;eful learning, to the be&s;t of my abilities: &mdash; that I have the happine&s;s of mankind at heart, and attempt, in a hi|&s;torical manner, to encrea&s;e their know|ledge in general; and in particular, to lead them to a pious contemplation and acknow|ledgment of God's un&s;peakable wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s manife&s;ted in the works of the crea|tion; &mdash; &s;hew them the truth of the te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="v" REF="4">of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> concerning a divine providence, immortality, and a future &s;tate; and that as virtue advances and improves, human felicity augments, and becomes a &s;ure progno&s;tick of that fulne&s;s of bli&s;s, which men of goodne&s;s and integrity are to enjoy, without interruption, frailty, and infirmity, in an unchangeable and everla&s;ting life. This was my &s;cheme. The&s;e things I had princi|pally in view, when, to vindicate my cha|racter from mi&s;repre&s;entation and idle &s;tories, and to illu&s;trate my <HI>memoirs of &s;everal ladies of Great-Britain,</HI> I &s;at down to write a true hi&s;tory of my life and notions. You will &s;ee at once, gentlemen, that this is the la|bored part of my work. Were I able to write &s;o as to per&s;uade even a few to alter their way of living, and employ their time for the future, in forming and training up their moral powers to perfection, I &s;hould think my&s;elf more fortunate and glorious than the greate&s;t genius in the temple of Fame. Indeed, gentlemen, fame or name, in this world, is not the thing I think of. <HI>Non e&s;t mortale quod opto,</HI> I can &s;ay with <HI>Lactantius:</HI> and were it within my power to choo&s;e, &s;ure I am, that I would be for ever unknown. But that was impo&s;&s;ible. In ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, as before ob&s;erved, and that tradition might not hand me down, when I
<PB N="vi" REF="5">am gone, in that variety of bad and fooli&s;h characters, which a malice, that knows no|thing of me, whi&s;pers while I am living; it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould tell my own &s;tory. The relation was likewi&s;e requi&s;ite, to ren|der the memoirs before mentioned intelligi|ble. The volumes of that work, which are to be publi&s;hed, would be quite dark, and not &s;o grateful as intended, without a pre|vious account of the author's life.</P>
<P>This, gentlemen, is the truth of the ca&s;e, and as I &s;ay as little of my&s;elf, in my rela|tion, as I can; and as much for true religion and u&s;eful learning, as I was able, I hope, from your rectitude and judgment, that you will get me a fair hearing; and I call upon you as my patrons, and the friends to learn|ing and truth, for your approbation of my good and pious intentions, tho' you &s;hould not be able to &s;ay one word of any excel|lencies in my writings. This is all I a&s;k. As I wi&s;h well to your cau&s;e, the cau&s;e of virtue and letters, and have chiefly endeavoured, according to my abilities, to make my readers acquainted with the <HI>maje&s;ty of the Deity, and his kingdom,</HI> and <HI>the great|ne&s;s of his excellency,</HI> before whom all the in|habitants of the earth, all powers and prin|cipalities, are as nothing; I hope you will, in return, favour me with your be&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>As to &s;ome &s;trange things you will find in the following journal; and a life, in various
<PB N="vii" REF="6">particulars, quite contrary to the common cour&s;e of action, I can a&s;&s;ure you, gentle|men, in re&s;pect of the &s;trange things, that however wonderful they may appear to you, yet they are; exclu&s;ive of a few decorations and figures, (nece&s;&s;ary in all works), &s;trictly true: and as to the difference of my life, from that of the generality of men, let it only be con&s;idered, that I was born in Lon|don, and carried an infant to Ireland, where I learned the Iri&s;h language, and became inti|mately acquainted with its original inhabitants: &mdash; that I was not only a lover of books from the time I could &s;pell them to this hour; but read with an extraordinary plea&s;ure, before I was twenty, the works of &s;everal of the fathers, and all the old romances; which tinged my ideas with a certain piety and extravagance, that rendered my virtues as well as my im|perfections particularly mine: &mdash; that by hard mea&s;ure, I was compelled to be an ad|venturer, when very young, and had not a friend in the univer&s;e but what I could make by good fortune, and my own addre&s;s: &mdash; that my wandering life, wrong conduct, and the iniquity of my kind, with a pa&s;&s;ion for extraordinary things and places, brought me into &s;everal great di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and that I had quicker and more wonderful deliverances from them than people in tribulation gene|rally receive: &mdash; that the dull, the formal, and the vi&s;ionary, the hard-hone&s;t man, and
<PB N="viii" REF="7">the poor-liver, are a people I have had no connexion with; but have always kept com|pany with the polite, the generous, the live|ly, the rational, and the brighte&s;t freethinkers of this age: &mdash; that be&s;ide all this, I was in the days of my youth, one of the mo&s;t ac|tive men in the world, at every exerci&s;e; and to a degree of ra&s;hne&s;s, often venturous, when there was no nece&s;&s;ity for running any hazards: in diebus illis, I have de&s;cended head-foremo&s;t from a high cliff into the ocean, to &s;wim, when I could, and ought, to have gone off a rock not a yard from the &s;urface of the deep. &mdash; I have &s;wam near a mile and a half out in the &s;ea, to a &s;hip that lay off, went on board, got clothes from the mate of the ve&s;&s;el, and proceeded with them to the next port; while my companion I left on the beach concluded me drowned, and related my &s;ad fate in the town.&mdash;I have taken a cool thru&s;t over a bottle, without the lea&s;t animo&s;ity on either &s;ide; but both of us depending on our &s;kill in the &s;mall &s;word, for pre&s;ervation from mi&s;chief. &mdash; Such things as the&s;e I now call wrong, and mention them only as &s;amples of a ra&s;hne&s;s I was once &s;ubject to, as an opportunity happened to come in the way. Let all the&s;e things be taken into the account, and I imagine, gentlemen, that what may at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem &s;trange, and next to incredible, will, on con&s;idering the&s;e particulars, not
<PB N="ix" REF="8">long remain &s;o, in your opinion; though you may think the relator an odd man. As to that, I have nothing to &s;ay. And if oddne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in &s;pirit, free|dom of thought, and a zeal for the di|vine unity; in a ta&s;te for what is natural, antique, romantic, and wild; in honouring women, who are admirable for goodne&s;s, letters, and arts; and in thinking, after all the &s;cenes I have gone through, that every thing here is vanity; except that <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> which gives us a right to <HI>expect beyond the grave;</HI> and procures us, in this world, the direction of infinite wi&s;dom, the protection of infinite power, and the friend|&s;hip of infinite goodne&s;s; &mdash; then, may it be written on my &s;tone,&mdash;<HI>Here lies an odd man.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much, gentlemen, I thought proper to &s;ay to you, that by being acquainted with the particulars relative to the com|plexion, and de&s;ign of the author, you might the ea&s;ier and the better compre|hend the various things you will find in the work he dedicates to you.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I wi&s;h you all happine&s;s; that your heads may lack no ointment, and your garments be always white and odoriferous: but e&s;pecially, may you pre&s;s on, like true critics, towards perfection; and may bli&s;s, glory, and ho|nour, be your reward and your Por|tion.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT the Tran&s;actions of my Life, and the ob&s;ervations and reflec|tions I have made on men and things, by &s;ea and land, in va|rious parts of the world, might not be bu|ried in oblivion, and by length of time, be blotted out of the Memory of Men, it has been my wont, from the days of my youth to this time, to write down <HI>Memorandums</HI> of every thing I thought worth noticing, as men and matters, books and circum&s;tances, came in my way; and in hopes they may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to my fellow-mortals I publi&s;h them. Some plea&s;ing, and &s;ome
<PB N="2" REF="17">&s;urprizing things the Reader will find in them. He will meet with mi&s;cellany thoughts upon &s;everal &s;ubjects. He will read, if he plea&s;es, &s;ome tender &s;tories. But all the relations, the thoughts, the ob&s;erva|tions, are de&s;igned for the advancement of valuable Learning, and to promote what&s;o|ever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what|&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good re|port.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1. A Reflec|tion.</HEAD>
<P> About fifty years ago the Midwife wheeled me in, and much &s;ooner than half a Century hence, in all human probability, Death will wheel me out. When Heaven plea&s;es, I am &s;atisfied. Life and death are equally welcome, becau&s;e equally parts of my way to Eternity. My lot has been a &s;warthy one in this fir&s;t State, and I am in hopes I &s;hall exchange worlds to advantage. As God, without all peradventure, brought his moral creatures into being, in order to increa&s;e their Virtue, and provide &s;uitable happine&s;s for the Worthy, the mo&s;t unfor|tunate here may expect immutable felicity at la&s;t, if they have endeavoured, in propor|tion to what power they had, to render them&s;elves u&s;eful and valuable, by a &s;ince|rity and benevolence of temper, a di&s;inte|re&s;tedne&s;s,
<PB N="3" REF="18">a communicativene&s;s, and the practice of tho&s;e duties, to which we are obliged by the frame of our Nature, and by the Relations we bear to God, and to the &s;ubjects of his government.</P>
<P>For my part, I confe&s;s that, many have been the failings of my Life, and great the defects of my obedience. But in the mid&s;t of all my failings and imperfections, my Soul hath always &s;ympathi&s;ed with the af|flicted, and my heart hath ever aked for the mi&s;eries of others. My hand has often re|lieved, when I wanted the &s;hilling to com|fort my &s;elf, and when it hath not been in my power to relieve, I have grieved for the &s;canty Accommodations of others. Many trouble&s;ome and expen&s;ive offices I have un|dertaken to do good to Men, and ever &s;ocial and free have I been in my demeanour, ea&s;y and &s;mooth in my addre&s;s; and therefore, I tru&s;t that, whenever I am removed from this horizon, it will be from a dark and cloudy &s;tate, to that of joy, light, and full Revelation. This felicitates my every day, let what will happen from without. This &s;upports me under every Affliction, and ena|bles me to mentain a habit of &s;atisfaction and joy in the general cour&s;e of my Life.</P>

<HEAD>2. Went to the Univer|&s;ity in 1720</HEAD>
<P> The things of my Childhood are not worth &s;etting down, and therefore I com|mence my Life from the fir&s;t month of the
<PB N="4" REF="19">&s;eventeenth year of my Age, when I was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, and entred a pen&s;ioner, tho' I had a larger yearly allowance than any fellow-commoner of my College. I was re|&s;olved to read there, and determined to im|prove my natural faculties to the utmo&s;t of my power. Nature, I was &s;en&s;ible, had be|&s;towed no genius on me. This and under|&s;tanding are only the privilege of extraordi|nary per&s;ons; who receive from Heaven the happy conjunction of qualities, that they may execute great and noble de&s;igns, and acquire the highe&s;t pitch of excellence in the profe&s;&s;ion they turn to; if they will take the pains to perfect the united qualities by art, and carefully avoid running into <HI>caprice</HI> and <HI>paradox;</HI> the Rocks on which many a Genius has &s;plit. But then I had a tolerable &s;hare of natural under&s;tanding, and from my infancy was teachable, and always attentive to the directions of good &s;en&s;e. This I knew might ri&s;e with &s;ome labour, to a half merit, tho' it could never gain immor|tality upon any account: and this was enough for me. I wanted only to acquire &s;uch de|grees of perfections as lay within the &s;mall &s;phere nature had chalked out for me.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>3. A College-Life.</HEAD>
<P> To this purpo&s;e I devoted my college-life to books, and for five years that I re|&s;ided in the Univer&s;ity, conver&s;ed &s;o much with the dead that I had very little inter|cour&s;e with the living. So totally had letters
<PB N="5" REF="20">engaged my mind, that I was but little af|fected towards mo&s;t other things. Walking and Mu&s;ick were my favorite recreations, and almo&s;t the only ones I delighted in. I had hardly a thought at that time of the fooli&s;h choi&s;es and pur&s;uits of men; tho&s;e fatal choices and pur&s;uits, which are owing to fal&s;e judgments, and to a habit of acting precipitantly, without examining the fancies and appetites; and therefore, very rarely went into the plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions which men of fortune in a Univer&s;ity too com|monly indulge in. My relaxation, after &s;tudy, was my german-flute, and the con|ver&s;ation of &s;ome ingenious, &s;ober friend; ge|nerally, my private tutor, who was a bright and excellent man; and if the weather per|mitted, I walked out into the country &s;everal miles. At this exerci&s;e, I had often one or other with me; but for the mo&s;t part, was obliged to go alone. My dog and my gun however were diver&s;ion enough on the way, and they frequently led me into &s;cenes of entertainment, which la&s;ted longer than the day. Some of them you will find in this Journal. The hi&s;tory of the beautiful <HI>Harriot Noel</HI> you &s;hall have by and by. </P>

<HEAD>4. A Cour&s;e of Reading in a College.</HEAD>
<P>At pre&s;ent, my &s;cheme requires me to &s;et down the method I pur&s;ued in my Readings, and let my Reader know the i&s;&s;ue of my &s;tudies. &mdash; My time I devoted to Phi|lo&s;ophy,
<PB N="6" REF="21">Co&s;mography, Mathematicks, and the Languages, for four years, and the fifth I gave to Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><LABEL>Of Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay.</LABEL> The fir&s;t book I took into my hand,  after receiving my note of admi&s;&s;ion, was the e&s;&s;ay of that fine Genius, Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> and I was &s;o plea&s;ed with this clear and accurate writer, that I looked into nothing el&s;e, by read|ing it three times over, I had made a tho|rough acquaintance with my own under|&s;tanding. He taught me to examine my abilities, and enabled me to &s;ee what objects my mind was fitted to deal with. He led me into the &s;anctuary of vanity and ignorance, and &s;hewed me how greatly true knowledge depended on a right meaning of words, and a ju&s;t &s;ignificancy of expre&s;&s;ion. In &s;um, from the E&s;&s;ay my Under&s;tanding received very great benefits, and to it I owe what im|provement I have made in the rea&s;on given me. If I could, I would per&s;uade all young Gentlemen to read it over and over with great attention, and I am &s;ure they would find them&s;elves very richly rewarded for their pains in reading it. They would acquire that ju&s;tne&s;s and truth of under&s;tanding, which is the great perfection of rational Beings.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. Natural Philo&s;ophy.</HEAD>
<P> When I had done, for a time, with this admirable E&s;&s;ay, I then began to &s;tudy the fir&s;t principles of things, the &s;tructure of
<PB N="7" REF="22">the Univer&s;e, the contexture of human bo|dies, the properties of bea&s;ts, the virtues of plants, and the qualities of metals, and was quite charmed with the contemplation of the beautiful order, and wi&s;e final cau&s;es of na|ture in all her laws and productions. The &s;tudy had a delightful influence on the tem|per of my mind, and in&s;pired into it a love of order in my heart, and in my outward manners. It likewi&s;e led me to the great fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and in repeated views of har|mony, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in all the works of nature, rivited upon my mind a fixed conviction, that all is under the admini&s;tra|tion of a general Mind, as far remote from all malice as from all weakne&s;s, whether in re&s;pect of under&s;tanding or of power. This gave me a due affection towards the infinite|ly perfect Parent of Nature, and as I con|templated his glorious Works, I was ob|liged in tran&s;ports to confe&s;s, that he de|&s;erved our love and admiration. This did al&s;o &s;atisfy me, that whatever the order of the world produces, is in the main both ju&s;t and good, and of con&s;equence, that we ought in the be&s;t manner to &s;upport what|ever hard&s;hips are to be endured for virtue's &s;ake: that acquie&s;cence and complacency with re&s;pect to ill accidents, ill men and in|juries, ought to be our part under a perfect admini&s;tration; and with benignity and
<PB N="8" REF="23">con&s;tancy we mu&s;t ever act, if there be a &s;ettled per&s;ua&s;ion, that all things are framed and governed by a univer&s;al mind. &mdash; Such was the effect the &s;tudy of Natural Philo&s;o|phy had upon my Soul. It &s;et beyond all doubt before me the moral perfection of the Creator and Governor of the Univer&s;e. And if this Almighty God, I &s;aid, is perfect Wi&s;|dom and Virtue, does it not follow, that he mu&s;t approve and love tho&s;e who are at due pains to improve in wi&s;dom; &mdash; and what he loves and delights in, mu&s;t he not make happy? This is an evident truth. It renders the cau&s;e of virtue quite triumphant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. Moral Phi|lo&s;ophy.</HEAD>
<P> But upon Ethicks or Moral Philo&s;ophy I dwelt the longe&s;t. This is the proper food of the Soul, and what perfects her in all the virtues and qualifications of a gentleman. This Science I collected in the fir&s;t place from the antient &s;ages and philo&s;ophers, and &s;tudied all the moral writers of Greece and Rome. With great plea&s;ure I &s;aw, that the&s;e immortal authors had delineated as far as human rea&s;on can go, that cour&s;e of life which is mo&s;t according to the intention of nature, and mo&s;t happy; had &s;hewn that this univer&s;e, and human nature in parti|cular, was formed by the wi&s;dom and coun|&s;el of a Deity, and that from the con&s;titution of our nature various duties aro&s;e: &mdash; that &s;ince God is the original independent Being,
<PB N="9" REF="24">compleat in all po&s;&s;ible perfection, of bound|le&s;s power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; the Cre|ator, Contriver, and Governor of this world, to whom mankind are indebted for innu|merable benefits mo&s;t gratuitou&s;ly be&s;towed; we ought to manife&s;t the mo&s;t ardent love and veneration toward the Deity, and wor|&s;hip him with affections of Soul &s;uited to the pre-eminence and infinite grandeur of the original Cau&s;e of all; ought to obey him, as far as human weakne&s;s can go, and humbly &s;ubmit and re&s;ign our&s;elves and all our intere&s;ts to his will; continually confide in his goodne&s;s, and con&s;tantly imitate him as far as our weak nature is capable. This is due to that original mo&s;t gracious Power who formed us, and with a liberal hand &s;upplies us with all things conducive to &s;uch plea&s;ure and happine&s;s as our nature can re|ceive: &mdash; That in re&s;pect of mankind, our natural &s;en&s;e of right and wrong points out to us the duties to be performed towards others, and the kind affections implanted by nature, excites us to the di&s;charge of them: that by the law of our con&s;titution and na|ture, ju&s;tice and benevolence are pre&s;cribed; and aids and an intercour&s;e of mutual offices required, not only to &s;ecure our plea&s;ure and happine&s;s, but to pre&s;erve our&s;elves in &s;afety and in life: that the law of nature, or na|tural right, forbids every in&s;tance of inju&s;tice,
<PB N="10" REF="25">a violation of life, liberty, health, property; and the exerci&s;e of our honourable, kind powers, are not only a &s;pring of vigorous efforts to do good to others, and thereby &s;e|cure the common happine&s;s; but they really procure us a joy and peace, an inward ap|plau&s;e and external advantages; while in|ju&s;tice and malice, anger, hatred, envy, and revenge, are often matter of &s;hame and re|mor&s;e, and contain nothing joyful, nothing glorious: In the greate&s;t affluence, the &s;a|vage men are mi&s;erable: &mdash; that as to our|&s;elves, the voice of rea&s;on declares, that we ought to employ our abilities and opportu|nities in improving our minds to an exten|&s;ive knowledge of nature in the &s;ciences; and by diligent meditation and ob&s;ervation, acquire that prudence, ju&s;tice, temperance, and fortitude, which &s;hould con&s;tantly go|vern our lives: &mdash; That &s;olid prudence, which abhors ra&s;hne&s;s, incon&s;ideratene&s;s, a fooli&s;h &s;elf-confidence, and craft, and under a high &s;en&s;e of moral excellence, con&s;iders and does what is really advantageous in life: &mdash; That ju&s;tice, which con&s;tantly regards the common intere&s;t, and in &s;ub&s;erviency to it, gives to each one whatever is due to him upon any natural claim: &mdash; That temperance, which re&s;trains and regulates the lower ap|petites, and di&s;plays the grace and beauty of manners: &mdash; And that fortitude, which
<PB N="11" REF="26">repre&s;&s;es all vain and exce&s;&s;ive fears, gives us a &s;uperiority to all the external accidents of our mortal &s;tate, and &s;trengthens the &s;oul again&s;t all toils or dangers we may be ex|po&s;ed to in di&s;charge of our duty; as an early and painful death with virtue and ho|nour, is highly preferable to the longe&s;t ig|nominious life, and no advantages can be compared in point of happine&s;s with the approbation of God, and of our own hearts.</P>
<P>That if in this manner we live prepared for any honourable &s;ervices to God, our fel|lows, and our&s;elves, and practice <HI>piety</HI> to|ward God, <HI>good-will</HI> toward men, and im|mediately aim at our own perfection, then we may expect, notwith&s;tanding our being involved in manifold weakne&s;&s;es and di&s;|orders of &s;oul, that the divine goodne&s;s and clemency will have mercy on &s;uch as &s;in|cerely love him, and de&s;ire to &s;erve him with duty and gratitude; will be propitious and placable to the penitents, and all who exert their utmo&s;t endeavours in the pur|&s;uits of virtue: And &s;ince the perfection of virtue mu&s;t con&s;titute the &s;upreme felicity of man, our efforts to attain it, mu&s;t be effectual in obtaining compleat felicity, or at lea&s;t &s;ome lower degree of it.</P>

<HEAD>7. Of Revea|led Reli|gion.</HEAD>
<P> This beautiful, moral Philo&s;ophy I found &s;cattered in the wtitings of the old
<PB N="12" REF="27">thei&s;t philo&s;ophers, and with great pains re|duced the various le&s;&s;ons to a &s;y&s;tem of ac|tive and virtuous offices: but this I knew was what the majority of mankind were in|capable of doing; and if they could do it, I &s;aw it was far inferior to revelation. Every Sunday I appropriated to the &s;tudy of re|veled Religion, and perceived as I read the &s;acred records, that the Works of Plato, and Cicero, and Epictetus, and all the unin&s;pired &s;ages of antiquity, were but weak rules in re&s;pect of the divine oracles. It is the mercy and power of God in the triumphs of grace, that re&s;tores mankind from the bondage and ignorance of idolatry. To this the &s;inner owes the conver&s;ion of his &s;oul. It is the &s;tatutes of the Lord that rejoyce the heart, and enlighten the eyes. What are all the rea&s;onings of the philo&s;ophers to the melody of that heavenly voice which crys continu|ally, <HI>Come unto me all ye that travel and are heavy laden, and I will refre&s;h you.</HI> &mdash; And what could their le&s;&s;ons avail with|out tho&s;e expre&s;s promi&s;es of grace and &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the blood of the new covenant confirms to mankind? The philo&s;ophy of Greece and Rome was admi|rable for the times and men: but it ad|mits of no compari&s;on with the divine le&s;|&s;ons of our holy religion, and the charter of God's pardon granted to us by his ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="28">Son. Be&s;ide, the philo&s;ophers were in &s;ome degree dark and doubtful in re&s;pect of death and futurity; and in relation to this world, there is not a power in their di&s;|cour&s;es, to pre&s;erve us from being undone by allurements, in the mid&s;t of plenty, and to &s;ecure our peace again&s;t the ca&s;ualties of fortune, and the torments of di&s;appointments; to &s;ave us from the cares and &s;ollicitudes which attend upon large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and give us a mind capable of reli&s;hing the good things before us; to make us ea&s;y and &s;atisfied as to the pre&s;ent, and render us &s;ecure and void of fear as to the future. The&s;e things we learn from revelation, and are informed by the &s;acred records only, that if we are placed here in the mid&s;t of many fears and &s;orrows, and are often perplexed with evils in this world; yet they are &s;o many warnings not to &s;et up our re&s;t here, but to keep a &s;ted|fa&s;t eye upon the things <HI>which God has prepared for tho&s;e who love him.</HI> It is the go&s;pel informs us, there is another &s;cene prepared for the moral world, and that ju&s;tice only waits to &s;ee the full proof of the righteou&s;ne&s;s, or unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s of men: that that &s;cene will open with the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, and we &s;hall either receive glory and immor|tality, if we have obeyed the calls of grace
<PB REF="29">to virtue and holine&s;s; &mdash; or, be doomed to the mo&s;t dreadful mi&s;eries, if we reject the coun&s;el of God, and live quite thought|le&s;s of the great concerns of eternity. The&s;e con&s;iderations made me prefer reveled re|ligion, in the beginning of my rational life. The morality of the antient philo&s;ophers I admired. With delight I &s;tudied their wri|tings, and received, I gratefully confe&s;s, much improvement from them. But the reli|gion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord I declared for, and look on the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah as the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ble&s;&s;ing God could be|&s;tow, or man receive. God having rai&s;ed up his Son Je&s;us, &s;ent him to ble&s;s you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities. And would men but hear and obey this life-giving Redeemer, his Go&s;|pel would re&s;tore rea&s;on and religion to their rightful authority over mankind; and make all virtue, and true goodne&s;s, flouri&s;h in the earth.</P>

<HEAD>8. Of fal&s;e religion.</HEAD>
<P> But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that, by the reli|gion of the New Te&s;tament, I do not mean any of tho&s;e modern &s;chemes of religion, which di&s;cover the evident marks and &s;igna|tures of &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, or of knavery and impo&s;ture; tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems which even miracles cannot prove to be true, be|cau&s;e the pieties are ab&s;urd, incon&s;i&s;tent and contradictory. The notions that are not
<PB N="15" REF="30">characterized by the rea&s;on of things, and the moral fitne&s;s of actions, I con&s;idered as repugnant to the veracity, wi&s;dom, and good|ne&s;s of the Almighty, and concluded, that that only could be chri&s;tian religion, which beared the vi&s;ible marks and &s;ignatures of be|nevolence, &s;ocial happine&s;s, and moral fitne&s;s, and was brought down from heaven to in|&s;truct mankind in the wor&s;hip of One eter|nal mind, and bring them to repentance, and amendment of life. This was the reli|gion I found in my Bible.

<HEAD>10. Method of reading Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P> In reading hi&s;tory, (my la&s;t years prin|cipal employment, during my re&s;idence in college), I began with the be&s;t writers of an|tient hi&s;tory and ended with modern times, epochs, centuries, ages; the extent of em|pires,
<PB N="17" REF="32">kingdoms, common-wealths; their progre&s;s, revolutions, changes and declen|&s;ions; the number, order, and qualities of the Princes, that have reigned over tho&s;e &s;tates and kingdoms, their actions military and civil; the characters and actions of the great men that flouri&s;hed under them; and the laws, the arts, learning and manners, I carefully marked down, and ob&s;erved not only how the fir&s;t governments were form|ed, but what the progre&s;s was of indu&s;try and property, which may be called the ge|nerative principle of empire.</P>
<P>When I had done with antient Hi&s;tory, I &s;at down to the be&s;t modern &s;tories I could get, and read of di&s;tant nations before I be|gan to &s;tudy my country's con&s;titution, hi|&s;tory and laws. When I had fini&s;hed the hi&s;tories of France, and Spain, and Italy, and Germany, and many more, then I turn|ed to Great-Britain, and in the fir&s;t place took a view of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution and government, in the antient books of the common law, and &s;ome more modern wri|ters, who out of them have given an account of this government. From thence I pro|ceeded to our Hi&s;tory, and with it joined in every King's reign the laws then made. This gave me an in&s;ight into the rea&s;on of our &s;tatutes, and &s;hewed me the true ground up|on which they came to be made, and what
<PB N="18" REF="33">weight they ought to have. By this means, I read the hi&s;tory of my country with in|telligence, and was able to examine into the excellence or defects of its government, and to judge of the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of its or|ders and laws. By this method I did like|wi&s;e know enough of the law for an Engli&s;h gentleman, tho' quite ignorant of the chi|cane, or wrangling and captious part of the law, and was well acquainted with the true mea&s;ure of right and wrong.

It taught me to place merit where it only lies, not in birth, not in beauty, not in riches, not in external &s;hew and magnificence, not in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; but, in a firm adherence to truth and rectitude; in an untainted heart, that would not pollute or pro&s;titute its in|tegrity in any degree, to gain the highe&s;t worldly honours, or to ward off the greate&s;t worldly mi&s;ery. This is true magnanimity: And he alone can be truly happy, as well as truly great, who can look down with ge|nerous contempt upon every thing that would tempt him to recede in the &s;malle&s;t degree from the paths of rigid hone&s;ty, candour and veracity.</P>

<P>This is the great le&s;&s;on, that virtue alone is true honour, true freedom, and &s;olid, du|rable happine&s;s. It is indeed its own re|ward. There are no &s;atisfactions equal to, or comparable with virtuous, rational ex|erci&s;es; nor can virtuous di&s;po&s;itions, and well improved moral powers be rewarded, or receive happine&s;s &s;uited to their nature, but from their exerci&s;es and employments about proper objects. And as virtue gives plea&s;ure here in proportion to the improve|ments it makes, far beyond all that mere &s;en&s;e can yield, in the mo&s;t advantageous circum&s;tances of outward enjoyment; &s;o in a &s;tate to come, it &s;hall be &s;o placed as its improvements require, that is, be placed in cir|cum&s;tances that &s;hall afford it bu&s;ine&s;s or employment proportioned to its capacity, and by means thereof the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. &mdash; Such a ba&s;is for building moral in&s;truc|tions upon we find in hi&s;tory.

<P> The ca&s;e however is; that the gene|rality of mankind are too corrupt, to be go|verned by the great univer&s;al law of &s;ocial na|ture, and to gratify ambition, avarice, and the like, employ a cunning or power, to &s;eize the natural rights and properties of others: and there|fore, <HI>to natural virtue grounded on the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, in them&s;elves,</HI> the fir&s;t and principal mean of &s;ecuring the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, it was nece&s;&s;ary to add two other grand principles, <HI>civil government</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> and &s;o have three conducible means to &s;ocial happine&s;s. The&s;e three are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the being of a publick, and of
<PB N="23" REF="38">them, religion as I take it, is of the fir&s;t con&s;equence; for the choice few on|ly mind a <HI>natural Virtue,</HI> or benevolence flowing from the rea&s;on, nature, and fitne&s;s of things; and <HI>civil government</HI> cannot always &s;ecure the happine&s; of mankind in particular ca&s;es: but <HI>Religion,</HI> rightly under&s;tood, and fixed upon its true and proper foundation, might do the work, in conjunction with the other two principles, and &s;ecure the happine&s;s of Society. If mankind were brought to the <HI>belief</HI> and <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of <HI>one only true God,</HI> and to a <HI>&s;incere obedience to his Will,</HI> as we have it di&s;covered in <HI>Revelation,</HI> I think, appetite and pa&s;&s;ion would cea&s;e to invade by violence or fraud, or &s;et up for private intere&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the publick &s;tock or common good.

<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>To the plain and &s;atisfactory method of &s;eeking for the faith in the &s;acred books, there are many ad|ver&s;aries and many objections rai&s;ed. There are (&s;ays a great man) a very numerous body of Chri&s;tians who know no other guides but the living guides of the pre|&s;ent church; and acknowledge no other <HI>faith,</HI> for the faith <HI>once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> but that which is <HI>now</HI> delivered to them by their <HI>pre&s;ent rulers,</HI> as &s;uch.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h this point, the greater part of the&s;e lay down the <HI>infallibility</HI> of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> church, and of eve|ry man of the pa&s;t ages, through who&s;e mouth, or by who&s;e hands, the pre&s;ent <HI>traditions</HI> of <HI>faith</HI> have de|&s;cended to them. And this, indeed, would be a very good method, if that &s;ingle proof of <HI>infallibility</HI> could be proved. But this is a <HI>point</HI> &s;o gro&s;s, and &s;o utterly void of all proof, that a great body of the <HI>Chri&s;tian world,</HI> have broke loo&s;e from the power of this mon|&s;ter, and declared for the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> it&s;elf, as the only <HI>guide</HI> or <HI>rule of faith;</HI> the only <HI>deliverer</HI> of the <HI>faith</HI> to <HI>us</HI> of later ages.</P>
<P>When this comes however to be put in practice, too many of the &s;ame per&s;ons who &s;et the &s;criptures up as the only guide, turn round on a &s;udden, and let us know that they mean by it, not the&s;e &s;acred original writings them&s;elves, but the <HI>interpretations,</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> put upon them by our &s;piritual <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> to which we are bound to &s;ubmit, and put under an obligation

<PB N="29" REF="44">

to find <HI>that</HI> to be the <HI>truth</HI> which is taught by the&s;e leaders.</P>
<P>But to this we reply with rea&s;on, that though we ought to pay a regard of &s;erious attention to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to find out and di&s;pen&s;e the truth, and &s;hew the re&s;pect of a due examination of what they affirm; yet we mu&s;t not yield the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due only to <HI>infallibility.</HI> It is our glory not to &s;ubmit to the voice of any man. We mu&s;t re&s;erve <HI>that</HI> regard, for <HI>God,</HI> and for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in matters of <HI>faith</HI> once <HI>delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Others, again, of the reformed, tell us, that the &s;urer way of knowing what was <HI>delivered</HI> near eighteen hundred years ago, is to take the <HI>original</HI> faith from the <HI>Councils</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> grave and good men, who met and writ for the &s;ettling of the <HI>faith.</HI> &mdash; And to this we an&s;wer, that the&s;e wi&s;e and good men cannot give &s;o good an account of the <HI>faith</HI> contained in the <HI>original books</HI> as the <HI>books them&s;elves</HI> which contain it.</P>
<P>To give an example to the purpo&s;e. If we would know the doctrine of the Church of England at the reformation, it is not the writings of any particular di|vines, many years after that period, that we mu&s;t con|&s;ult; or any a&s;&s;embly of them; but the authentic acts, and declarations, and &s;ermons, made and recorded at the time; for many of the doctrines thought <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> at the <HI>reformation,</HI> have been &s;ince changed by gradual alterations; &mdash; by explainers u&s;ing their own &s;tile and manner of expre&s;&s;ion, and introducing their own &s;cheme of philo&s;ophy, and judgment in commenting, into the &s;cheme of doctrine to be explained. This produces great variation from what was once &s;ettled. What was once e&s;teemed fundamental is thereby altered. &mdash; Let this be applied to the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian writers, after the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were departed,

<PB N="30" REF="45">

and as their <HI>language</HI> and philo&s;ophy were <HI>various,</HI> and they differed from one another, great variations mu&s;t creep into the doctrines delivered by them.

<HEAD>13. The &s;tory of Harriot Noel.</HEAD>
<P> But it is time to tell my reader the &s;tory of the beautiful <HI>Harriot Noel,</HI> which I promi&s;ed in my third memorandum. &mdash;
<PB N="29" REF="44">On the glorious fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, before the bea&s;ts were rou&s;ed from their lodges, or the
<PB N="30" REF="45">birds had &s;oared upwards, to pour forth their morning harmony; while the mountains and the groves were over&s;hadowed by a dun ob&s;curity, and the dawn &s;till dappled the drow&s;y Ea&s;t with &s;pots of grey; in &s;hort, before the &s;un was up, or, with his au&s;pi|cious pre&s;ence, began to animate inferior na|ture, I left my chamber, and with my gun and dog, went out to wander over a plea&s;ant country. The different a&s;pects and the va|rious points of view were charming, as the light in fleecy rings encrea&s;ed; and when the whole flood of day de&s;cended, the <HI>im|belli&s;hed early &s;cene</HI> was a fine entertainment. Delighted with the beauties of this morn|ing, I climbed up the mountains, and tra|velled through many a valley. The game was plenty, and for full five hours, I journeyed onward, without knowing where I was going, or thinking of a return to college.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock however I began to grow very hungry, and was looking round to &s;ee if I could di&s;cover any proper habi|tation
<PB N="31" REF="46">to my purpo&s;e, when I ob&s;erved in a valley, at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;omething that looked like a man&s;ion. That way therefore I moved, and with no little difficulty, as I had a precipice to de&s;cend, or mu&s;t go a mile round, to arrive at the place I wanted: down therefore I marched, got a fall by the way that had like to have de&s;troyed me, and after all, found it to be a &s;hed for cat|tle. The bottom however was very beau|tiful, and the &s;ides of the hills &s;weetly cop&s;ed with little woods. The valley is &s;o divided, that the ri&s;ing &s;un gilds it on the right hand, and when declining, warms it on the left.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Veniens dextrum latus a&s;piciat Sol,</L>
<L>Laevum di&s;cedens curru fugiente vaporet.</L></Q>
<P>A pretty brook here likewi&s;e babbles along, and even <HI>Hebrus</HI> &s;trays not round <HI>Thrace</HI> with a purer and cooler &s;tream.</P>
<P>Fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus, ut nec Frigidior Thracam nec purior ambiat Hebrus.</P>
<P><LABEL>A Country Seat.</LABEL> In this &s;weet and delicious &s;olitude,  I crept on for &s;ome time, by the &s;ide of the mur|muring &s;tream, and followed as it winded through the vale, till I came to a little har|monick building, that had every charm and
<PB N="32" REF="47">proportion architecture could give it. It was &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground in a broad part of the fruitful valley, and &s;urrounded with a garden, that invited a pen&s;ive wan|derer to roam in its delightful retreats, and walks amazingly beautiful. Every &s;ide of this fine &s;pot was planted thick with under|wood, and kept &s;o low, as not to prevent a pro&s;pect to every plea&s;ing remote object.</P>
<P>Finding one of the garden doors left open, I entred immediately, and to &s;creen my &s;elf from the &s;corching beams of the &s;un, got into an imbowered way, that led me to a large fountain, in a ring or circu|lar opening, and from thence, by a gradual, ea&s;y, &s;hady a&s;cent, to a &s;emicircular amphi|theatre of ever-greens, that was quite charm|ing. In this were &s;everal &s;eats for ea&s;e, re|pa&s;t, or retirement; and at either end of it a rotunda or temple of the Ionick or|der. One of them was converted into a grotto or &s;hell-hou&s;e, in which a politene&s;s of fancy had produced and blended the greate&s;t beauties of nature and decoration. The other was a library, filled with the fine&s;t books, and a va&s;t variety of mathe|matical in&s;truments. Here I &s;aw Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> &s;itting, and &s;o intent at writing, that &s;he did not take any notice of me, as I &s;tood at the window, in a&s;toni&s;hment looking at the things before me, and e&s;pecially at the
<PB N="33" REF="48">amazing beauties of her face, and the &s;plen|dor of her eyes; as &s;he rai&s;ed them now and then from the paper &s;he writ on, to look in|to a Hebrew Bible, that lay open upon a &s;mall de&s;k before her. The whole &s;cene was &s;o very uncommon, and &s;o va&s;tly amaz|ing, that I thought my &s;elf for a while on &s;ome &s;pot of magic ground, and almo&s;t doubted the reality of what my eyes beheld; till Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> by accident, looked full at me, and then came forward to the open window, to know who I wanted.</P>
<P>Before I could an&s;wer, I found a venera|ble old gentleman &s;tanding by my &s;ide, and he &s;eemed much more &s;urprized at the &s;ight of me than his daughter was; for, as this young lady told me afterward, &s;he gue&s;&s;ed at once the whole affair; &s;eeing me with my gun and dog, in a &s;hooting dre&s;s; and knew it was a natural curio&s;ity brought me into the garden, and &s;toped me at the window, when I &s;aw her in &s;uch an attitude, and in &s;uch a place. &mdash; This I a&s;&s;ured them was the truth of my ca&s;e, with this &s;mall addition however, that I was ready to peri&s;h for want of &s;omething to eat; having been from four in the morning at hard exerci&s;e, and had not yet broke my fa&s;t.&mdash; If this be the ca&s;e, &s;ays the good old man, you are welcome, Sir, to Eden-Park, and you &s;hall &s;oon have the be&s;t breakfa&s;t our hou&s;e affords.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="49">Upon this Mr. <HI>Noel</HI> brought me into his hou&s;e, and the lovely <HI>Harriot</HI> made tea for me, and had &s;uch plenty of fine cream, and extraordinary bread and butter &s;et before me, that I breakfa&s;ted with uncommon plea&s;ure. The honour and happine&s;s of her company rendered the repa&s;t quite delightful. There was a civility &s;o very great in her manner, and a &s;ocial goodne&s;s &s;o charming in her talk and temper, that it was un&s;peakable delight to &s;it at table with her. She a&s;ked me a number of que&s;tions relating to things and books, and people, and there was &s;o much good &s;en&s;e in every inquiry, &s;o much good humour in her reflections and replications, that I was intirely charmed with her mind; and lo&s;t in admiration, when I contemplated the wonders of her face, and the beauties of her per&s;on.</P>
<P>When breakfa&s;t was over, it was time for me to depart, and I made half a dozen at|tempts to ri&s;e from my chair; but without her laying a ro&s;y finger on me, this illu&s;tri|ous maid had &s;o totally &s;ubdued my &s;oul, and deprived me of all motive power, that I &s;at like the renowned Prince of the Ma&s;&s;a|getes, who was &s;tiffened by inchantment in the apartment of the Prince&s;s <HI>Phedima,</HI> as we read in <HI>Amadis de Gaul.</HI> This Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> &s;aw very plain, and in compa&s;&s;ion to my misfortune, generou&s;ly threw in a hint
<PB REF="50">now and then, for a little farther conver&s;a|tion to colour my unrea&s;onable delay. But this could not have been of &s;ervice much longer, as the clock had &s;truck twelve, if the old gentleman, her father, had not re|turned to us, and told me, he in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;taying to dine with him; for he loved to take a gla&s;s after dinner with a facetious companion, and would be obliged to me for my company. At pre&s;ent (Mr. <HI>Noel</HI> continued) you will excu&s;e me, Sir, as bu|&s;ine&s;s engages me till we dine: but my daughter will chat the hours away with you, and &s;hew you the curio&s;ities of her library and grott. <HI>Harriot</HI> will &s;upply my place.</P>
<P>This was a delightful invitation indeed, and after returning my hearty thanks to the old gentleman for the favour he did me, I addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> when her father was gone, and we were walking back to the library in the garden, and told her in|genuou&s;ly, that tho' I could not be po&s;itive as to the &s;ituation of my &s;oul, whether I was in love with her or not, as I never had experienced the pa&s;&s;ion before, nor knew what it was to admire a woman; having lived till that morning in a &s;tate of indifference to her &s;ex; yet, I found very &s;trange emo|tions within me, and I was &s;ure I could not leave her without the mo&s;t lively and af|flicting inquietude. You will pardon, I
<PB N="36" REF="51">hope, Madam, this effu&s;ion of my heart, and &s;uffer me to demon&s;trate by a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and actions, that I honour you in a manner unutterable, and from this time, can imagine no happine&s;s but with you.</P>
<P><LABEL>A Conver|&s;ation with Mi&s;s Noel, in relation to the Lan|guage of Adam, and the Primae|vity of the Hebrew Tongue.</LABEL> Sir,  (this inimitable maid replied) you are an intire &s;tranger to me, and to declare a pa&s;&s;ion on a few hours acquaintance, mu&s;t be either to try my weakne&s;s, or becau&s;e you think a young woman is incapable of reli&s;h|ing any thing but &s;uch &s;tuff, when alone in conver&s;ation with a gentleman. I beg then I may hear no more of this, and as I am &s;ure you can talk upon many more rational &s;ubjects, reque&s;t your favor, to give me your opinion on &s;ome articles in this <HI>Hebrew Bible</HI> you &s;ee lying open on the table in this room. My father, Sir, among other things he has taken great pains to in&s;truct me in, for &s;e|veral years that I have lived with him in a kind of &s;olitary &s;tate, &s;ince the death of my mother, whom I lo&s;t when I was very young, has taught me to read and under|&s;tand this in&s;pired <HI>Hebrew</HI> book; and &s;ays we mu&s;t a&s;cribe <HI>primaevity</HI> and <HI>&s;acred prero|gatives</HI> to this language. For my part, I have &s;ome doubts as to this matter, which I dare not mention to my father. Tell me, if you plea&s;e, what you think of the thing.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="52">Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> (I an&s;wered) &s;ince it is your command, that I &s;hould be &s;ilent as to that <HI>flame</HI> your glorious eyes and under&s;tanding have lighted up in my &s;oul, like &s;ome &s;u|perior nature, before whom I am nothing, &s;ilent I will be, and tell you what I fancy on a &s;ubject I am certain you under&s;tand much better than I do. My knowledge of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is but &s;mall, tho' I have learned to read and under&s;tand the Old-Te&s;tament in the <HI>Ante-Babel</HI> language.</P>
<P>My opinion on your que&s;tion is, that the <HI>Biblical Hebrew</HI> was the language of Para|di&s;e, and continued to be &s;poken by all men down to, and at the time of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> writing the pentateuch, and long after. <HI>Abraham,</HI> tho' bred in <HI>Chaldea,</HI> could conver&s;e freely with the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> and the King of <HI>Gerar;</HI> nor do we find, that any variety of &s;peech interrupted the commerce of his &s;on <HI>I&s;aac</HI> with the &s;everal nations a|round, or that it ever &s;topt <HI>Jacob</HI> in his tra|vels. Nay, the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in their journey through the de&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> (after they had been &s;ome hundred years in <HI>Egypt</HI>) tho' joined by a mixt multitude, and meeting with divers kinds of people, had not cor|rupted their language, and were ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood, becau&s;e it was then the univer&s;al one. The &s;implicity and di&s;tinctne&s;s of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue pre&s;erved its purity &s;o long
<PB N="38" REF="53">and &s;o univer&s;ally. It could not well be de|generate till the knowledge of nature was lo&s;t, as its words con&s;i&s;t but of two or three letters, and are perfectly well &s;uited to con|vey &s;en&s;ible and &s;trong ideas. It was at the <HI>captivity</HI> 


<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P>The captivity began at <HI>Nebuzaradan</HI>'s taking and burning the city and temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and &s;ending <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> the la&s;t King, in chains, to <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar,</HI> who ordered his children to be butchered before his face, his eyes to be put out, and then thrown into a dungeon, where he died. This happened before our Lord 588 years; after the flood, 1766; of the world 3416.</P></NOTE>


, in the &s;pace of &s;eventy years, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> by tempori&s;ing with the ig|norant victors, &s;o far neglected the u&s;age of their own tongue, that none but the <HI>&s;cribes</HI> or learned men could under&s;tand <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s books.</P>
<P>This I confe&s;s (Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> &s;aid) is a plau|&s;ible account of the <HI>primaevity</HI> and <HI>pre-emi|nence</HI> of the <HI>&s;acred Hebrew,</HI> but I think it is not nece&s;&s;ary the account &s;hould be al|lowed as fact. As to its being the language in Paradi&s;e, this is not very probable, as a compa&s;s of 1800 years mu&s;t have changed the fir&s;t language very greatly by an in|crea&s;e of words, and new inflections, ap|plications, and con&s;tructions of them. The few fir&s;t inhabitants of the earth were oc|cupied in few things, and wanted not a
<PB N="41" REF="54">variety of words; but when their de&s;cendants invented arts and improved &s;ciences, they were obliged to coin new words and technical terms, and by extending and transferring their words to new &s;ubjects, and u&s;ing them figuratively, were forced to multiply the &s;en&s;es of tho&s;e already in u&s;e. The lan|guage to be &s;ure was thus gradually culti|vated, and every age improved it. All liv|ing languages are liable to &s;uch change. I therefore conclude, that the language which &s;erved the <HI>fir&s;t pair</HI> would not do for &s;uc|ceeding generations. It became va&s;tly more copious and exten&s;ive, when the numbers of mankind were great, and their language mu&s;t &s;erve conver&s;ation and the ends of life, and an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of intelligence and corre&s;pondence. New words and new terms of &s;peech, from time to time were nece&s;&s;ary, to give true ideas of the things, actions, offices, places, and times peculiar to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> Even Hutchin&s;on allows there was &s;ome coinage, &s;ome new words framed. We find in the lat|ter prophets words not to be met with in the <HI>Pentateuch:</HI> and from thence we may &s;up|po&s;e, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> u&s;ed words unknown to <HI>Nimrod</HI> and <HI>Heber:</HI> and that the men at <HI>Shinaar</HI>

<P>You force me to &s;mile, (the illu&s;trious Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> replyed) and oblige me to call you an odd compound of a man. Pray, Sir, let me have no more of tho&s;e romantic flights, and I will an&s;wer your que&s;tion as well as I can; but it mu&s;t be at &s;ome other time. There is more to be &s;aid on the mi|racle at <HI>Babel,</HI> and its effects, than I could di&s;patch between this and our hour of dining, and therefore, the remainder of our lei&s;ure till dinner, we will pa&s;s in a vi&s;it to my grotto, and in walking round the garden to the parlour we came from. To the grotto then we went, and to the be&s;t of my power I will give my reader a de&s;cription of this &s;plendid room.</P>
<P><LABEL>A De&s;crip|tion of Mi&s;s Noel's grotto.</LABEL> In one of the fine rotunda's I have men|tioned, at one end of the green amphitheatre very lately de&s;cribed, the &s;hining apartment was formed. Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI>'s hand had covered the floor with the mo&s;t beautiful <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> my eyes have ever beheld, and filled the arched roof with the riche&s;t fo&s;&s;il gems. The Mo&s;aic painting on the ground was wrought with &s;mall coloured &s;tones or peb|bles, and &s;harp pointed bits of gla&s;s, mea|&s;ured
<PB N="44" REF="59">and proportioned together, &s;o as to imitate in their a&s;&s;emblage the &s;trokes and colour of the objects, which they were in|tended to repre&s;ent, and they repre&s;ented by this lady's art, the <HI>Temple of Tranquillity,</HI> de&s;cribed by <HI>Volu&s;enus</HI> in his dream.</P>
<P><LABEL>The Tem|ple of Tranquility and a re|markable In&s;cription.</LABEL> At &s;ome di&s;tance the fine temple looks like a beautiful painted picture,  as do the birds, the bea&s;ts, the trees, in the fields about it, and the river which murmurs at the bot|tom of the ri&s;ing ground; Amnis lucidus &amp; vado&s;us in quo cernere erat varii generis pi&s;ces colludere. So wonderfully did this genius perform the piece, that fi&s;hes of ma|ny kinds &s;eem to take their pa&s;stime in the bright &s;tream. But above all, is the image of the philo&s;opher, at the entrance of the temple, va&s;tly fine. With pebbles and &s;craps of gla&s;s, all the beauties and graces are ex|pre&s;&s;ed, which the pencil of an able arti&s;t could be&s;tow on the picture of <HI>Democritus.</HI> You &s;ee him as <HI>Diogenes Ldertius</HI> has drawn him, with a philo&s;ophical joy in his coun|tenance, that &s;hews him &s;uperior to all events. <HI>Summum bonorum finem &s;tatuit e&s;&s;e laetitiam,</HI> non eam quae &s;it eadem voluptati, &s;ed <HI>eam per quam animus degit perturbationis expers;</HI> and with a finger, he points to the following golden in&s;cription on the portico of the temple:&mdash;
<Q><PB N="45" REF="60">Flagrans &s;it &s;tudium bene merendi de &s;eip&s;o, Et &s;eip&s;um perficiendi.</Q>
That is, <HI>By a rectitude of mind and life, &s;e|cure true happine&s;s and the applau&s;e of your own heart, and let it be the labour of your every day, to come as near perfection as it is po&s;&s;ible for human nature to get.</HI> This Mo&s;aic piece of painting is indeed an ad|mirable thing. It has a fine effect in this grotto, and is a noble monument of the ma&s;terly hand of Mi&s;s <HI>Noel.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was her fine genius le&s;s vi&s;ible in the &s;triking appearance of the extremely beau|tiful &s;hells and valuable curio&s;ities, all round the apartment. Her father &s;pared no co&s;t to procure her the fine&s;t things of the ocean and rivers from all parts of the world, and pebbles, &s;tones, and ores of the greate&s;t cu|rio&s;ity and worth. The&s;e were all di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as not only &s;hed a glo|rious lu&s;tre in the room, but &s;hewed the un|der&s;tanding of this young lady in natural knowledge.</P>
<P>In one part of the grot, were collected and arranged the &s;tony coverings of all the &s;hell-fi&s;h in the &s;ea, from the <HI>&s;triated patella</HI> and its &s;everal &s;pecies, to the <HI>pholades</HI> in all their &s;pecies: and of tho&s;e that live in the fre&s;h &s;treams, from the <HI>&s;uboval limpet</HI> or <HI>um|bonated patella</HI> and its &s;pecies, to the <HI>trian|gular,
<PB N="46" REF="61">and deeply &s;triated cardia.</HI> Even all the land-&s;hells were in this collection, from the <HI>pomatia</HI> to the <HI>round-mouthed turbo.</HI> The mo&s;t beautiful genera of the &s;ea-&s;hells, in|termixed with fo&s;&s;il corals of all the kinds; with animal &s;ub&s;tances become fo&s;&s;il; and with copper-ores; agates; pebbles, pieces of the fine&s;t marmora and alaba&s;tritae, and the mo&s;t elegant and beautiful marca&s;ites, and chry&s;tals, and &s;pars. The&s;e filled the greate&s;t part of the walls, and in cla&s;&s;es, here and there, were &s;cattered, as foils to rai&s;e the lu&s;tre of the others, the inferior &s;hells.</P>
<P>Among the &s;imple &s;ea-&s;hells, that is, tho&s;e of one &s;hell, without a hinge, I &s;aw &s;everal rare ones, that were neither in Mrs. <HI>O'Hara</HI>'s, nor in Mrs. <HI>Crafton</HI>'s grottos in <HI>Fingal,</HI> as I ob&s;erved to tho&s;e ladies 

<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><P>I had once a &s;weet little country hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of tho&s;e ladies, and u&s;ed to be often at their gardens and grottos. Mrs. <HI>Crafton</HI> had the fine&s;t &s;hells, but her grott was dull and regular, and had no appearance of nature in the formation. She was a pious, plain, refined lady, but had not a fancy equal to the operation required in a &s;hell-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The excellent, the polite, the well-bred, the good and unfortunate Mrs. <HI>O'Hara</HI> had a glorious fancy. She was a genius, and had an imagination that formed a grotto wild and charming as <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI>'s. Her fancy did likewi&s;e form the garden (in which the grotto &s;tood, near the margin of a flood) into a paradi&s;e of delights.

<PB N="47" REF="62">

Many a plea&s;ing, &s;olitary hour, have I pa&s;&s;ed in this charming place; and all at la&s;t I &s;aw in ruins; the garden in di&s;order &mdash; and every fine &s;hell torn from the grotto.</P>
<P>Such are the changes and chances of this fir&s;t &s;tate; changes wi&s;ely de&s;igned by providence as warnings not to &s;et up our re&s;t here: that we may turn our hearts from this world, and with all our might labour for that life which &s;hall never peri&s;h.</P>
<P>What ruined Mrs. <HI>O'Hara</HI>'s grotto deprived me of my little green and &s;hady retreat. <HI>Charles O'Hara,</HI> this lady's hu&s;band, a &s;trange man, from whom I rented my pretty farm, and to whom I had paid a fine to lower the rent, had mortgaged it, unknown to me, to the famous <HI>Damer,</HI> and that powerful man &s;wallowed all. All I had there was &s;eized for arrears of intere&s;t due of Mr. <HI>O'Hara,</HI> and as I was ever liable to di&s;train|ing, I took my leave of <HI>Fingall.</HI></P><PB N="46" REF="61"></NOTE>


. The &s;hells I mean are the following ones.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="62">
<LIST>
<HEAD>Fine &s;hells.</HEAD>
<ITEM><LABEL>1. The Sea Trumpet.</LABEL> The <HI>&s;ea-trumpet,</HI>  which is in its per|fect &s;tate, nine inches long, an inch and half diameter at its mouth or irregular lip, and the opening at the &s;mall end about half an inch. The &s;urface is a beautiful brown, prettily &s;potted with white, and the pipe has fourteen annular ridges that are a little ele|vated, and of a fine purple colour.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2. The Admi|ral.</LABEL> The <HI>admiral</HI> is va&s;tly beautiful, a <HI>vo|luta</HI> two inches and a half long, and an inch in diameter, at the head, from whence it decrea&s;es to a cone with an obtu&s;e point. The ground colour is the brighte&s;t, elegant yellow, finer than that of Sienna marble, and this ground &s;o variegated with the
<PB N="48" REF="63">brighte&s;t colours, that a little more than a third part of the ground is &s;een. Broad fa&s;ciae, the mo&s;t charmingly varied, &s;urround it, and the clavicle is the mo&s;t elegant of ob|jects in colours, brightne&s;s and irregularities. There is a punctuated line of variations that runs in the centre of the yellow fa&s;cia, and is wonderfully pretty. This beautiful Ea&s;t Indian &s;ells at a great price.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3. The Crown Imperial.</LABEL> The <HI>crown imperial</HI> is likewi&s;e ex|tremely beautiful. This voluta is four inches long, two in diameter at the top, and its head adorned with a charming &s;eries of fine tubercles, pointed at the extremities. The ground is a clear pale, and near the head and extremity of the &s;hell, two very beautiful zones run round. They are of the brighte&s;t yellow, and in a manner the mo&s;t elegant, are variegated with black and white purple. It is an Ea&s;t Indian.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>4. The He|brew Let|ter.</LABEL> The <HI>Hebrew letter,</HI> another voluta, is a fine curio&s;ity. It is two inches in length, and an inch and a quarter in diameter at the top. It is a regular conic figure, and its ex|erted clavicle has &s;everal volutions. The ground is like the white of a fine pearl, and the body all over variegated with irregular marks of black, which have a near re&s;em|blance of the Hebrew characters. This ele|gant &s;hell is an Ea&s;t Indian.</ITEM>
<PB N="49" REF="64">
<ITEM><LABEL>5. The white Voluta.</LABEL> The <HI>white voluta,</HI> with brown and blue and purple &s;pots. This very elegant &s;hell, who&s;e ground is a charming white, is found on the coa&s;t of Guinea, from five to &s;ix inches in length, and its diameter at the head often three inches. It tapers gradually, and at the extremity is a large obtu&s;e. Its variegations in its &s;pots are very beautiful, and its &s;pots are principally di&s;po&s;ed in many circles round the &s;hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>6. The But|terfly.</LABEL> The <HI>butterfly</HI> is a <HI>voluta</HI> the mo&s;t ele|gant of this beautiful genus. Its length is five inches in its perfection, and two and a half broad at the head. The body is an ob|tu&s;e cone: the clavicle is pointed, and in &s;e|veral volutions. The ground is the fine&s;t yellow, and beautifyed all over with &s;mall brown &s;pots, in regular and round &s;eries. The&s;e variegations are exceeding pretty, and as this rare Ea&s;t Indian &s;hell has be&s;ide the&s;e beauties three charming bands round the body, which are formed of large &s;pots of a deep brown, a pale brown, and white, and re&s;emble the &s;pots on the wings of butterflies, it is a beautiful &s;pecies indeed. The animal that inhabits this &s;hell is a <HI>limax.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>7. The Tulip Cylinder.</LABEL> The <HI>tulip cylinder</HI> is a very &s;carce and beautiful native of the Ea&s;t-Indies, and in its &s;tate of perfection and brightne&s;s of colour, of great value. Its form is cylindric, its length four inches, and its diameter two and
<PB N="50" REF="65">a half, at its grate&s;t increa&s;e. Its clavicle has many volutions, and terminates in an obtu&s;e point. The ground colour is white, and its variegations blue and brown. They are thrown into irregular clouds in the mo&s;t beautiful manner, and into &s;ome larger and &s;maller &s;pots. The limax inhabits this fine &s;hell.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I likewi&s;e &s;aw in this grotto the fine&s;t &s;pecies of the <HI>purpura,</HI> the <HI>dolia,</HI> and the <HI>porcellana.</HI> There was of the fir&s;t genus the <HI>thorny woodcock:</HI> &mdash; of the &s;econd, the <HI>harp &s;hell:</HI> &mdash; and of the third, the <HI>argus &s;hell.</HI> 
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>8. The thorny Woodcock.</LABEL> The <HI>thorny woodcock</HI> is ventrico&s;e, and approaches to an oval figure. Its length, full grown, is five inches; the clavicle &s;hort, but in volutions di&s;tinct; and its ro&s;trum from the mouth twice the length of the re&s;t of the &s;hell. This &s;nout and the body have four &s;eries of &s;pines, generally an inch and half long pointed at the ends, and &s;omewhat crooked. The &s;pines lie in regular, longitudinal &s;eries. The mouth is almo&s;t round, but the opening is continued in the form of a &s;lit up the ro&s;trum. The colour of this American, and extremely elegant &s;hell, is a tawny yellow, with a fine mixture of a lively brown, and by bleaching on the coa&s;ts, it gets many &s;pots of white.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>9. The Harp.</LABEL> The <HI>beautiful harp</HI> is a Chine&s;e; three inches and half long, and two and a half
<PB N="51" REF="66">in diameter. The &s;hell is tumid and in|flated, and at the head large&s;t. It has an oblong clavicle in &s;everal volutions, pointed at the extremity, and the other extreme is a &s;hort ro&s;trum. The whole &s;urface is orna|mented with elevated ribs, that are about twice as thick as a &s;traw, and as di&s;tant from each other as the thickne&s;s of four &s;traws. The colour is a fine deep brown, variegated with white and a paler brown, in a manner &s;urprizingly beautiful.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>10. The Argus.</LABEL> The extremely elegant <HI>argus</HI> is from the coa&s;t of Africa, and is &s;ometimes found in the Ea&s;t-Indies. Its length, in a &s;tate of perfection, is four inches and a half; its di|ameter three. It is oblong and gibbous, has a wide mouth, and lips &s;o continued beyond the verge, as to form at each extremity a broad and &s;hort beak. The colour is a fine pale yellow, and over the body are three brown fa&s;ciae: but the whole &s;urface, and the&s;e fa&s;ciae, are ornamented with multitudes of the mo&s;t beautiful round &s;pots, which re|&s;emble eyes in the wings of the fine&s;t but|terflies. The <HI>limax</HI> inhabits this charm|ing &s;hell. This creature is the &s;ea-&s;nail.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>11. The concha of Venus.</LABEL> The <HI>concha of Venus</HI> was the next &s;hell in this young lady's collection that en|gaged my attention. One of them was three inches long, and two and a half in diameter. The valves were convex, and in longitudinal
<PB N="52" REF="67">direction deeply &s;triated. The hinge at the prominent end was large and beautifully wrought, and the opening of the &s;hell was covered with the mo&s;t elegant wrinkled lips, of the mo&s;t beautiful red colour, finely in|termixed with white; the&s;e lips do not unite in the middle, but have &s;lender and beau|tiful &s;pines round about the truncated ends of the &s;hell. This <HI>&s;hell of Venus</HI> is an Ame|rican, and valued by the collectors at a high rate.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>12. The Ham|mer Oy&s;ter.</LABEL> But of all the curious &s;hells in this won|derful collection, the <HI>hammer oy&s;ter</HI> was what I wondered at mo&s;t; it is the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;hell in the world. It re&s;embles a pickax, with a very &s;hort handle and a long head. The body of the &s;hell is in the place of the han|dle of the in&s;trument, and is four inches and a half long, and one inch and a half in diameter. What an&s;wered to the head of the pickax was &s;even inches long, and three quarters of an inch in diameter. This head terminates at each end in a narrow obtu&s;e point, is uneven at the edges, irregular in its make, and lies cro&s;swi&s;e to the body: yet the valves &s;hut in the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t elegant manner. The edges are deeply fur|rowed and plated, and the lines run in ir|regular directions. The colour without is a fine mixture of brown and purple; and within, a pearly white, with a tinge of
<PB N="53" REF="68">purple. This rare &s;hell is an Ea&s;t-Indian, and whenever it appears at an auction is rated very high. I have known ten guineas given for a perfect one.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>With a large quantity of the&s;e mo&s;t beau|tiful &s;hells, which are rarely &s;een in any collections, and with all the family of the <HI>pectens,</HI> the <HI>cardiae,</HI> the <HI>&s;olens,</HI> the <HI>cylindri,</HI> the <HI>murexes,</HI> the <HI>turbines,</HI> the <HI>buccina,</HI> and every &s;pecies of the fine&s;t genera of &s;hells, Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> formed a <HI>grotto</HI> that exceeded every thing of the kind I believe in the world; all I am &s;ure that I have &s;een, ex|cept the late Mrs. <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s in <HI>Richmond|&s;hire;</HI> which I &s;hall give my Reader a de|&s;cription of, when I travel him up tho&s;e Engli&s;h Alpes. It was not only, that Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI>'s happy fancy had blended all the&s;e things in the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful di&s;po&s;ition over the walls of the rotunda; but her fine genius had produced a variety of grotts within her grotto, and falling wa|ters, and points of view. In one place, was the famous <HI>Atalanta,</HI> and her delightful cave: and in another part, the Godde&s;s and Uly&s;&s;es's &s;on appeared at the entrance of that grott, which under the appearance of a rural plainne&s;s had every thing could charm the eye: the roof was ornamented with &s;hell-work; the tape&s;try was a tender
<PB N="54" REF="69">vine; and limpid fountains &s;weetly purled round.</P>
<P><LABEL>An image of Epictetus and a re|markable Legend.</LABEL> But what above all the finely fancyed works in Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI>'s grotto plea&s;ed me,  was, a figure of the Philo&s;opher <HI>Epictetus,</HI> in the centre of the grott. He &s;at at the door of a cave, by the &s;ide of a falling water, and held a book of his philo&s;ophy in his hand, that was written in the manner of the an|tients, that is, on parchment rolled up clo&s;e together. He appeared in deep meditation, and as part of the book had been unwrap|ped and gradually extended, from his knee on the ground, one could read very plain, in large Greek characters, about fifty lines. The Engli&s;h of the le&s;&s;on was this.</P>

<P><LABEL>Old Mr. Noel's cha|racter.</LABEL> Such was Mi&s;s <HI>Noel's</HI> grotto,  and with her, if it had been in my power to choo&s;e, I had rather have pa&s;&s;ed in it, the day in talk|ing of the various fine &s;ubjects it contained, than go in to dinner; which a &s;ervant informed us was &s;erving up, ju&s;t as I had done reading the above recited philo&s;ophi|cal le&s;&s;on. Back then we returned to the parlour, and there found the old Gentleman. We &s;at down immediately to two very good di&s;hes, and when that was over, Mr. <HI>Noel</HI> and I drank a bottle of old Alicant. Tho' this Gentleman was upwards of eighty, yet years had not deprived him of rea&s;on and &s;pi|rits. He was lively and &s;en&s;ible, and &s;till a mo&s;t agreeable companion. He talked of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> as if he had lived there before the Aera of chri&s;tianity. The court of Augu&s;tus he was &s;o far from being a &s;tranger
<PB N="57" REF="72">to, that he de&s;cribed the principal per&s;ons in it; their actions, their plea&s;ures, and their caprices, as if he had been their contempo|rary.

<PB N="61" REF="76">we will con&s;ider the <HI>miracle</HI> at <HI>Babel,</HI> and enquire into the language of the world at that time.

<P>As to a <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>confe&s;&s;ions</HI> (Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> replyed), it appears to me to be a notion without any foundation to re&s;t on.

<P>All this (I &s;aid) is very ju&s;t, and gives me delight and &s;atisfaction.

<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> tradition (replied Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI>) is pre&s;erved in their <HI>Targum,</HI> and tells us, that the whole earth after the flood was of one <HI>&s;peech,</HI> or <HI>&s;ort of words,</HI> and when at their fir&s;t remove from <HI>Ararat,</HI> they came to <HI>Shinar,</HI> they con&s;ulted to build them a <HI>city,</HI>

No one knew what his fellow &s;aid: and they &s;lew one another, and cea&s;ed from building the city. Therefore he called the name of it <HI>Babel;</HI> becau&s;e there the Lord mingled together the tongues of all the inhabitants of the other. This you read in the <HI>Targum</HI> that was written before the days of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> affirm: or, if not &s;o early, yet it is a very antient book, and the <HI>doctor</HI> who compo&s;ed it mu&s;t certainly know the meaning of the word <HI>Shephah</HI> better than Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on.</HI> It appears upon the whole, that the argu|ment of this famous modern is without foundation.</P>
<P>It is indeed (I an&s;wered): But then I am not able to conceive how <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;ons conver&s;ed with &s;o many nations &mdash;or how the <HI>Hebrew</HI> that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> writ in was pre&s;erved. Illuminate me in the&s;e things,

<P>At pre&s;ent, all I can do more on the He|brew &s;ubject, is to ob&s;erve that, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue, I imagine the <HI>one prevailing language</HI> before the <HI>miracle</HI> at <HI>Babel,</HI> (which one language was afterwards called <HI>Hebrew)</HI> tho' <HI>divided</HI> and <HI>&s;wallowed</HI> as it were at the <HI>Tower,</HI> was kept without change in the line of <HI>Shem,</HI> and continued their tongue.

I likewi&s;e imagine, it mu&s;t be allowed, that this <HI>Hebrew</HI> conti|nued the <HI>vernacular tongue</HI> of the old <HI>Ca|naanites.</HI> It is otherwi&s;e unaccountable how the <HI>Hebrew</HI> was found to be the <HI>language</HI> of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> when the family of <HI>Abra|ham</HI> came among them again, after an ab|&s;ence of more than 200 years. If they had
<PB N="69" REF="84">had another tongue at the confu&s;ion, was it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Abraham,</HI> during his temporary &s;ojournments among them, and in the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of his peregrination, to per&s;uade &s;o many tribes to quit their <HI>dialect,</HI> and learn his language;&mdash; or, if his influence had been &s;o amazing, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, they would not return again to their old language, after he had left them, and his family was away from them more than 200 years? No, Sir. We cannot ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing. The language of the old <HI>Canaanites</HI> could not be a different one from the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> If you will look into <HI>Bochart</HI>

<P>This being the ca&s;e: the <HI>Phenician</HI> or <HI>Canaaniti&s;h</HI> tongue, being the &s;ame language that the line of <HI>Heber</HI> &s;poke, with this only difference, that by the latter it was retained in greater purity, being in the mouths of a few, and tran&s;mitted by in&s;truction; it fol|lows, that <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;ons could talk with all the&s;e tribes and communities; and as to the other nations he had commu|nication with, he might ea&s;ily conver&s;e with them, as he was a <HI>Syrian</HI> by birth, and to be &s;ure could talk the <HI>Aramiti&s;h</HI> dialect as well as <HI>Laban</HI> his brother. The <HI>Aramiti&s;h</HI> was the cu&s;tomary language of the line of <HI>Shem.</HI> It was their vulgar tongue. The <HI>language</HI> of the <HI>old world,</HI> that was &s;poken immediately before the <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> and was called <HI>Hebrew</HI> from <HI>Heber,</HI> they re&s;erved for <HI>&s;acred u&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> ended, and my amaze|ment was &s;o great, and my pa&s;&s;ion had ri&s;en &s;o high for &s;uch uncommon female intelli|gence, that I could not help &s;natching this beauty to my arms, and without thinking of what I did, impre&s;&s;ed on her balmy mouth half a dozen ki&s;&s;es. This was wrong, and gave very great offence: but &s;he was too
<PB N="71" REF="86">good to be implacable, and on my begging her pardon, and prote&s;ting it was not a wilful rudene&s;s, but the magic of her glo|rious eyes, and the bright powers of her mind, that had tran&s;ported me be&s;ide my &s;elf, &s;he was reconciled, and a&s;ked me, if I would play a game of cards? With delight I replyed, and immediately a pack was brought in. We &s;at down to cribbage, and had played a few games, when by accident Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> &s;aw the head of my german flute, which I always brought out with me in my walks, and carried in a long pocket within &s;ide my coat.

In a moment I an&s;wered, and tak|ing from my pocket book the following lines, I reached them to her, and told her I had the day before &s;et them to one of Lulli's airs, and in&s;tantly began to breathe the &s;ofte&s;t harmony I could make &mdash;</P>

<P>This &s;ong delighted the old gentleman to a great degree. He told me, he was charm|ed
<PB N="77" REF="92">with it, not only for the fine mu&s;ick I made of it, but the morality of it, and liked me &s;o much, that I was mo&s;t heartily wel|come to make his &s;olitary retreat my home, as often and as long as I plea&s;ed. And in|deed I did &s;o, and continued to behave in &s;uch a manner, that in two months time, I gained &s;o intirely his affections, and &s;o to|tally the heart of his admirable daughter, that I might have her in wedlock when I plea&s;ed, after the expiration of that current year, which was the young lady's reque&s;t, and be &s;ecured of his e&s;tate at his death; be&s;ide a large fortune to be immediately paid down; and this, tho' my father &s;hould re|fu&s;e to &s;ettle any thing on me, or Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> my wife. This was generous and charming as my heart could de&s;ire. I thought my &s;elf the happie&s;t of men. Every week I went to Eden-Park, one time or other, to &s;ee my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> and pay my re&s;pects to her worthy father. We were while I &s;tayed a mo&s;t happy family, and enjoyed &s;uch &s;atisfactions as few I believe have ex|perienced in this tempe&s;tuous hemi&s;phere. Mr. <HI>Noel</HI> was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of his daugh|ter, and he could not regard me more if I had been his own &s;on. I loved my <HI>Harriot</HI> with a fondne&s;s beyond de&s;cription, and that glorious girl had all the e&s;teem I could wi&s;h &s;he had for me. Our mutual felicity could
<PB N="78" REF="93">ri&s;e no higher till we gave our hands, as we had already plighted our hearts.</P>
<P>This world is a &s;eries of vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, and contains &s;o little &s;olid, la&s;ting felicity, as I have found it, that I cannot call <HI>life</HI> more than a <HI>deception;</HI> and, as <HI>Swift</HI> &s;ays it, he is the happie&s;t man, who is be&s;t deceived. When I thought my&s;elf within a fortnight of being married to Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> and thereby made as compleatly happy in every re&s;pect as it was po&s;&s;ible for a mortal man to be, the &s;mall pox &s;teps in, and in &s;even days time, reduced the fine&s;t human frame in the uni|ver&s;e to the mo&s;t hideous and offen&s;ive block. The mo&s;t amiable of human creatures mor|tifyed all over, and became a &s;pectacle the mo&s;t hideous and unbearable.&mdash;This broke her father's heart in a month's time, and the paradice I had in view, &s;unk into everla&s;ting night.</P>
<P><LABEL>Mi&s;s Noel's character.</LABEL> My heart,  upon this &s;ad accident, bled and mourned to an extreme degree. All the tender pa&s;&s;ions were up in my &s;oul, and with great difficulty could I keep my ruffled &s;pi|rits in tolerable decorum. I lo&s;t what I va|lued more than my life &mdash; more than repeat|ed millions of worlds, if it had been po&s;&s;ible to get them in exchange. This engaged, be|loved partner, was an honour to her &s;ex, and an ornament to human kind. She was one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable of wo|men;
<PB N="79" REF="94">and her life quite glorious for piety to God, compa&s;&s;ion to the nece&s;&s;itous and mi&s;erable, benevolence and good will to all, with every other grace and virtue. The&s;e &s;hined with a bright lu&s;tre in her whole de|portment, and rendered her beloved, and the delight of all that knew her. Sen&s;e and genius were in her united, and by &s;tudy, re|flexion, and application, &s;he improved the talents, in the happie&s;t manner. She had acquired a &s;uperiority in thinking, &s;peaking, writing, and acting, and in manners, her be|haviour, her language, her de&s;ign, her un|der&s;tanding, was inexpre&s;&s;ibly charming. Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> died in the 24th year of her age, the 29th of December, in the year 1724.</P>
<P><LABEL>A reflexion on the death of Mi&s;s Noel.</LABEL> This di&s;mal occurrence &s;at powerfully on my &s;pirits for &s;ome time,  and for near two months, I &s;carcely &s;poke a word to any one. I was &s;ilent, but not &s;ullen. As my tears and lamentations could not &s;ave her, &s;o I knew they could not fetch her back again. Death and the grave have neither eyes nor ears. The thing to be done upon &s;o me|lancholly an occa&s;ion, is to adore the Lord of infinite wi&s;dom, as he has a right to &s;trike our comforts dead, and &s;o improve the awful event, by labouring to render our whole temper and deportment chri&s;tian and divine, that we may able to live, while we do live, &s;uperior to the &s;trokes of fortune, and the
<PB N="80" REF="95">calamities of human life; and when God bids us die, (in whatever manner, and at whatever time it may be) have nothing to do but to die, and &s;o go enter into our ma|&s;ter's joy. This is wi&s;dom. This good we may extract from &s;uch doleful things. This was the effect my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI>'s death had on me, and when I &s;aw my&s;elf deprived of &s;o invaluable a thing in this world, I deter|mined to double my diligence in &s;o acting my part in it, that whenever I was to pa&s;s through the la&s;t extremity of nature, I might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a ble&s;&s;ing to another world, and by virtue of the &s;ublime excellencies of our holy religion, proceed to the abodes of immortality and immutable felicity.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could per&s;uade you, reader, to re&s;olve in the &s;ame manner. If you are young, and have not yet experienced life, believe me, all is <HI>vanity,</HI> di&s;appointment, wearine&s;s, and di&s;&s;atisfaction, and in the mid&s;t of troubles and uncertainties, we are ha&s;tening on to an unknown world, from whence we &s;hall never return again. Whe|ther our di&s;&s;olution be near, we know not; but this is certain, that <HI>death,</HI> that univer&s;al conqueror, is making after us apace, to &s;eize us as his captives; and therefore, <HI>tho' a man live many years, and rejoice in them all,</HI> (which is the ca&s;e of very few), <HI>yet let him remember the days of darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="96">And when death does come, our lot may be the mo&s;t racking pains and di&s;tempers, to fa&s;ten us down to our &s;ick-beds, till we re&s;ign our &s;pirits to &s;ome &s;trange region, our breath to the common air, and our bodies to the du&s;t from whence they were taken. Di&s;mal &s;i|tuation! If in the days of our health, we did not make our happine&s;s and moral worth corre&s;pond &mdash; did not labour, in the time of our &s;trength, to e&s;cape from <HI>wrong opinion</HI> and <HI>bad habit,</HI> and to render our minds <HI>&s;in|cere and incorrupt;</HI> if we did not wor&s;hip and love the <HI>&s;upreme mind,</HI> and adore his <HI>divine admini&s;tration,</HI> and all the <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> of his <HI>pro|vidence.</HI> If this was not our ca&s;e, before corruption begins to lay hold of us, deplora|ble mu&s;t we be, when torments come upon us, and we have only hopele&s;s wi&s;hes that we had been wi&s;er, as we de&s;cend in ago|nies to our <HI>&s;olitary retreat;</HI> to proceed from thence to judgment. Language cannot paint the horrors of &s;uch a condition. The an|gui&s;h of mind, and the torture of body, are a &s;cene of mi&s;ery beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Or if without torment, we lie down in &s;i|lence, and &s;ink into the land of forgetfulne&s;s, yet, &s;ince the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> is to rai&s;e us from the regions of darkne&s;s, and bring us to the &s;e&s;&s;ions of righteou&s;ne&s;s, where all our ac|tions are to be &s;trictly tried and examined, and every one &s;hall be judged according to

<HEAD>14. Left the Univer&s;ity, and went down to &s;ee my father in the coun|try, and had a very mi|&s;erable re|ception.</HEAD>
<P> Having thus lo&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Noel,</HI> and my good old friend, her worthy father, I left the univer&s;ity, and went down to the country, after five years and three months ab&s;ence, to &s;ee how things were po&s;ited at home, and pay my re&s;pects to my father; but I found them very little to my liking, and in a &s;hort time, returned to Dublin again. He
<PB N="83" REF="98">had lately married in his old age a young wife, who was one of the mo&s;t artful, fal&s;e, and in&s;olent of women, and to gratify her to the utmo&s;t of his power, had not only brought her nephew into his hou&s;e, but was ridiculou&s;ly fond of him, and lavi&s;hly gratifyed all his de&s;ires. Whatever this little brute (the &s;on of a drunken beggar, who had been a journey-man glover) was plea&s;ed, in wantonne&s;s, to call for, and that his years, then &s;ixteen, could require, my father's fortune in an in&s;tant produced; while &s;carcely one of my rational de|mands could be an&s;wered. Money, cloaths, &s;ervants, hor&s;es, dogs, and all things he could fan&s;y, were given him in abundance; and to plea&s;e the ba&s;e&s;t of women, and the mo&s;t cruel &s;tep-mother that ever the Devil in&s;pired to make the &s;on of another woman mi&s;erable, I was denied almo&s;t every thing. The fine allowance I had at the Univer&s;ity was taken from me. Even a hor&s;e to ride out to the neighbouring gentlemen, was re|fu&s;ed me, tho' my father had three &s;tables of extraordinary cattle; and till I purcha&s;ed one, was forced to walk it, where-ever I had a mind to vi&s;it. What is &s;till more incredi|ble (if any thing of &s;everity can be &s;o, when a mother-in-law is &s;overeign) I was not al|lowed to keep my hor&s;e even at gra&s;s on the land, tho' five hundred acres of freehold
<PB N="84" REF="99">e&s;tate &s;urrounded the man&s;ion, but obliged to graze it at a neighbouring farmer's. Nor was this all the hard mea&s;ure I received. I was ordered by my father to become the young man's preceptor; to &s;pend my pre|cious time in teaching this young&s;ter, and in labouring to make the little de&s;picable dunce a &s;cholar. All this was more than I could bear. My life became in&s;upportable, and I re&s;olved to range even the wilds of <HI>Africa,</HI> if nothing better offered, rather than live a mi&s;erable &s;lave under the cruel tyranny of tho&s;e unrelenting oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>My father however, by the way, was as fine a gentleman as ever lived, a man of ex|traordinary under&s;tanding, and a &s;cholar; likewi&s;e remarkably ju&s;t and good to all the world, except my &s;elf, after I left the Uni|ver&s;ity: and to do him all the ju&s;tice in my power, and vindicate him &s;o far as I am able, I mu&s;t not conceal, that great as the a&s;cendant was, which my mother-in-law had over him, and as much as he was hen|pecked by that low woman, who had been his &s;ervant maid, yet it was not to her only that my &s;ufferings were owing. Religion had a hand in my mi&s;ery. Fal&s;e religion was the &s;pring of that paternal re&s;entment I &s;uffered under.</P>

This work, on my coming home, was transferred from my &s;i&s;ter to me, and for about one week I perform|ed to the old gentleman's &s;atisfaction, as my voice was good, and my reading di&s;tinct and clear: but this office was far from being grateful to me, as I was become a &s;trict <HI>Unitarian,</HI> by the le&s;&s;ons I had received from my private tutor in college, and my own examinations of the vulgar faith. It went again&s;t my con&s;cience to u&s;e the trithei&s;tic form of prayer, and became at la&s;t &s;o un|ea&s;y to me, that I altered the prayers the fir&s;t Sunday morning, and made them more agreeable to <HI>&s;cripture</HI> as I conceived. My father at this was very highly enraged, and his pa&s;&s;ion aro&s;e to &s;o great a height, upon my defending my confe&s;&s;ion, and refu&s;ing to read the e&s;tabli&s;hed form, that he called me the mo&s;t impious and execrable of wretches, and with violence drove me from his pre|&s;ence. Soon after however he &s;ent me <HI>Lord Nottingham's Letter to Mr. Whi&s;ton,</HI> and de&s;ired I would come to him when I had carefully read it over. I did &s;o, and he a&s;ked me what I thought of the book. I an&s;wered, that I thought it a weak piece, and if he would hear me with patience, in relation to that in particular, and to the ca&s;e in general, perhaps he might think my re|ligion
<PB N="86" REF="101">a little better than at pre&s;ent he &s;up|po&s;ed it to be. I will hear you, he &s;aid: proceed. &mdash; Then I immediately began, and for a full hour repeated an apology I had prepared 

<NOTE N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><P>The Reader will find this apology in the appen|dix to this life.

<PB N="87" REF="102">I had projected, on &s;eeing how things went. I did not communicate my de|&s;ign to a &s;oul, nor take my leave of any one, but in the true &s;pirit of adventure, abandoned my father's dwelling, and &s;et out to try what fortune would produce in my favor. I had the world before me, and Providence my guide. As to my &s;ub&s;tance, it con&s;i&s;ted of a pur&s;e of gold, that con|tained fifty Spani&s;h pi&s;toles, and half a &s;core moidores; and I had one bank note for five hundred pounds, which my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> left me by her will, the morning &s;he &s;ick|ened; and it was all &s;he had of her own to leave to any one. With this I &s;et forward, and in five days time arrived from the We&s;tern extremity of Ireland at a village called Rings-end, that lies on the Bay of Dublin.

<HEAD>16. My depar|ture from Rings end, and what happened at &s;ea.</HEAD>
<P> The wind, in the afternoon, &s;eemed good and fair, and we were in hopes of get|ting to <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> the next day: but at mid|night, a tempe&s;t aro&s;e, which held in all the horrors of hurricane, thunder and light|ning, for two nights and a day, and left us no hope of e&s;cape. It was a dreadful &s;cene indeed, and looked as if the la&s;t fatal a&s;|&s;ault was making on the globe. As we had many pa&s;&s;engers, their cries were terri|ble, and affected me more than the fla&s;hing fires and the winds. For my part, I was well reconciled to the great change, but I confe&s;s that nature &s;hrunk at the frightful manner of my going off, which I expected every moment the &s;econd night. At la&s;t however, we got into <HI>Whitehaven.</HI> It plea&s;ed the great King of all the earth to bid the &s;torm, <HI>Have done.</HI></P>
<P>Four remarkable things I noticed while the tempe&s;t la&s;ted.
<LIST>
<LABEL>The ca&s;e of Dean Wha|ley.</LABEL>
<ITEM>One was, that the <HI>Dean</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="104">of <HI>Derry,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whaley,</HI> whom we had on board, (who had nineteen hundred a year from the church, for teaching the people to be Chri&s;tians) was va&s;tly more afraid than one young lady of the company, who ap|peared quite &s;erene. The Dean, tho' a fine Orator at land, was ridiculous in his fears at &s;ea. He &s;creamed as loud as any of the people: But this young lady behaved, like an angel in a &s;torm. She was calm and re&s;igned, and &s;at with the mate and me, the &s;econd night, di&s;cour&s;ing of the divine power, and the laws of nature, in &s;uch up|roars. By the way, neither mate, nor ma&s;ter, nor hand, could keep the deck. The &s;hip was left to the mercy of the winds and waves.</ITEM>
<LABEL>The Ca&s;e of Mi&s;s Mel|noth.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The &s;econd remarkable thing is,  that as this young lady went into naked bed in her cabbin, the fir&s;t night, before the tempe&s;t began to &s;tir, it was not many hours till a &s;ea &s;truck us upon the quarter, and drove in one of our quarter, and one of our &s;tern dead lights, where we &s;hipped great quantities of water, that put us under great apprehen&s;ions of foundering, and filled &s;o &s;uddenly the clo&s;e wooden bed in which Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> lay, that had not I chanced to be then leaning again&s;t the partition, and &s;natched her out, the moment I found my &s;elf all over wet, and half covered with the breaking &s;ea, &s;he mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed. I ran up on deck
<PB N="90" REF="105">with her in my arms, and laid her al|mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s and naked there: and as there was no &s;taying many minutes in that place, I threw my great coat over her, and then brought her down to my own birth, which I gave her, and got her dry cloaths from her trunk, and made her drink a large gla&s;s of brandy, which &s;aved her life. She got no cold, which I thought very &s;trange, but was hurt a little in the re|move. When all was over, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would never go into naked bed, on board &s;hip, again.</ITEM>
<LABEL>The ca&s;e of &s;ome offi|cers in the &s;torm.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The third particular is,  that there were &s;ome officers on board, mo&s;t mon&s;trou&s;ly wicked men, and when we were given over by the captain, and no hope he thought of being &s;aved, the&s;e warriors lamented like young children, and were the mo&s;t di&s;mal, di&s;turbing howlers on board: yet, when we got on land, they had done with <HI>O Lord, O Lord,</HI> and began again their ob&s;cene talk, and to damn them&s;elves at every word to the center of hell.</ITEM>
<LABEL>The ca&s;es of Gavan and Henley.</LABEL>
<ITEM>The fourth thing was this.  There was on board with us a young gentleman of my ac|quaintance, one <HI>Pierce Gavan,</HI> who had been a fellow-commoner in my time of Trinity, Dub|lin. The fir&s;t day of the &s;torm, he was carried over-board by a rolling &s;ea, and fairly lodged in the ocean, at above twenty yards di|&s;tance from the &s;hip; but the next tumbling
<PB N="91" REF="106">billow brought him back again. He was laid on the deck without any hurt. On the contrary, one <HI>Charles Henley,</HI> a young mer|chant, was beat over, and we never &s;aw him more.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><LABEL>Henley's character.</LABEL> <HI>Henley</HI> was not only a man of &s;en&s;e and prudence,  who had an hone&s;t mind, and a cultivated under&s;tanding, but by &s;earch and enquiries into the doctrines, in&s;titutions and motives of reveled religion, had the highe&s;t regard for the truths of genuine Chri&s;tianity, and cho&s;e the be&s;t means in his power to make him&s;elf acceptable to God.</P>
<P><LABEL>Gavan's character.</LABEL> <HI>Gavan,</HI>  on the contrary, had no &s;en&s;e of religion, nor did he ever think of the power and goodne&s;s of God. He was a mo&s;t pro|phane &s;wearer, drank exce&s;&s;ively, and had the heart to debauch every pretty woman he &s;aw, if it had been po&s;&s;ible for him to do &s;o much mi&s;chief. &mdash; Yet this man, who never reformed that I heard, and who&s;e impieties have &s;hocked even young fellows who were no &s;aints, was a&s;toni&s;hingly pre&s;erved; and <HI>Henley,</HI> who had the ju&s;te&s;t natural notions, and li&s;tened to Revelation, peri&s;hed mi&s;era|bly? How &s;hall we account for &s;uch things? By &s;aying, that the world that now is, and the world that is to come, are in the hands of God, and every tran&s;action in them is quite right, tho' the rea&s;on of the procedure may be beyond our view. We cannot judge certainly of the ends and purpo&s;es of Pro|vidence,
<PB N="92" REF="107">and therefore to pa&s;s judgment on the ways of God, is not only impious, but ridiculous to the la&s;t degree. This we know for certain, that whenever, or however, a good man falls, he falls into the hand of God, and &s;ince we mu&s;t all die, the difference as to time and manner, &s;ignifies very little, when there is an infinite wi&s;dom to di&s;tin|gui&s;h every ca&s;e, and an infinite goodne&s;s to compen&s;ate all our mi&s;eries. This is enough for a Chri&s;tian. Happy is the man, and for ever &s;afe, let what will happen, who acts a rational part, and has the fear and love of God in his thoughts. With plea&s;ure he looks into all the &s;cenes of futurity. When &s;torms and earthquakes threaten calamity, di&s;tre&s;s, and death, he maintains an inward peace.</P>

<HEAD>17. The pa&s;&s;en|gers land, and divide into &s;everal companies, May 10, 1725.</HEAD>
<P> When we had obtained the wi&s;hed for &s;hore, the pa&s;&s;engers all divided. The Dean and his lady, and &s;ome other ladies, went one way, to an inn recommended to them by a gentleman on board; the war|riors and Gavan marched to another hou&s;e; and the young lady, who&s;e life was by me pre&s;erved, and I, went to the Talbot, which the mate informed me had the be&s;t things and lodging, tho' the &s;malle&s;t inn of the town. This mate, Mr. <HI>Whitwell,</HI> de&s;erves to be particularly mentioned, as he was remark|able for good breeding, good &s;en&s;e, and a
<PB N="93" REF="108">con&s;iderable &s;hare of learning, tho' a &s;ailor; as remarkable this way, as the captain of the &s;hip was the other way, that is, for being the roughe&s;t and mo&s;t brutal old tar that ever commanded a ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<HEAD>18. The &s;tory of Whit|well, the mate of the Skinner and Jenkins.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Whitwell</HI> the mate, about thirty-&s;ix years of age at this time, told me,  he was the &s;on of a man who once had a great for|tune, and gave him a univer&s;ity education, but left an e&s;tate &s;o encumbered with debts, and ruined with mortgages, that its income was almo&s;t nothing, and therefore the &s;on &s;old the remains of it, and went to &s;ea with an Ea&s;t-India captain, in the 22d year of his age, and was &s;o fortunate abroad, that he not only acquired riches, in four years time that he trafficked about, between Batavia and the Gulph of Per&s;ia, but married a young Indian Lady, (the daughter of a Ra|jah, or petty Prince in the Mogul Empire) who was rich, wi&s;e, and beautiful, and made his life &s;o very happy, for three years that &s;he lived, that his &s;tate was a mere Paradi&s;e, and he &s;eemed a little &s;overeign. But this fleeting &s;cene was &s;oon over, and on his re|turn to England with all his wealth, their &s;hip was taken by the pirates of Madaga&s;car, who robbed him of all he had, and made him a mi&s;erable &s;lave for two years and up|wards. That he e&s;caped from them to the tawny generation of Arabs, who lived on
<PB N="94" REF="109">the mountains, the other &s;ide of this African i&s;land, and u&s;ed him with great humanity; their chief being very fond of him, and en|tertaining him in his mud-wall palace: he married there a pretty little yellow creature, niece to the poor ruler, and for twelve months was very far from being mi&s;erable with this partner, as they had a hand&s;ome cottage and &s;ome cattle, and this wife was good-humour it&s;elf, very &s;en&s;ible, and a re|ligious woman; her religion being half Ma|hometani&s;m and half Judai&s;m. But &s;he died at the years end, and her uncle, the Chief, not living a month after her, <HI>Whitwell</HI> came down from the mountains to the next &s;ea coa&s;t under the conduct of one of the Ara|bians, his friend, and meeting with a Eu|ropean &s;hip there, got at la&s;t to London. A little money he had left behind him in England, by way of re&s;erve, in ca&s;e of ac|cidents, if he ever &s;hould return to his own country, and with this he dre&s;t him&s;elf, got into bu&s;ine&s;s, and came at la&s;t to be mate of the Skinner and Jenkins. His de&s;tiny, he added, was untoward, but as he had thought, and read, and &s;een enough in his wide travels, to be convinced, the world, and every being, and every atom of it, were directed and governed by unerring wi&s;dom, he derived hopes and comforts from a due acknowledgment of God. There are more
<PB N="95" REF="110">born to mi&s;ery than to happine&s;s, in this life: but all may die to be for ever glorious and ble&s;&s;ed, if they plea&s;e. &mdash; This conclu&s;ion was ju&s;t and beautiful, and a life and &s;enti|ments &s;o uncommon I thought de&s;erved a memorial.</P>

<HEAD>19. An uncom|mon &s;cene of life.</HEAD>
<P> Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> and I continued at the Talbot for three weeks, and during that time, breakfa&s;ted, dined, and &s;upped together. Except the hours of &s;leep, we were rarely from each other. We walked out together every day, for hours conver&s;ed, &s;ometimes went to cards, and often &s;he &s;ung, delight|fully &s;ung, while on my flute I played. With the greate&s;t civility, and the mo&s;t exact good manners, we were as intimate as if we had been acquainted for ages, and we found a &s;atisfaction in each others company, as great as lovers generally experience: yet &s;o much as one &s;yllable of the pa&s;&s;ion was no mentioned: not the lea&s;t hint of love on either &s;ide was given, while we &s;tayed at Whitehaven; and I believe, neither of us had a thought of it. It was a friend&s;hip the mo&s;t pure and exalted, that commenced at my &s;aving her life, in the manner I have related, and by &s;ome &s;trange kind of magic, our notions and inclinations, tempers and &s;entiments, had acquired &s;uch a &s;amene&s;s in a few days, that we &s;eemed as two &s;piritual Socias, or duplicates of each others mind.
<PB N="96" REF="111"><HI>Body</HI> was quite out of the ca&s;e, tho' this lady had an extravagance of beauty. My &s;ole delight was that fine percepient, which &s;hed a lu&s;tre on her outward charms. How long this &s;tate would have la&s;ted, had we conti|nued more time together, and had the image of the late Mi&s;s <HI>Noel</HI> been more effaced, or worn out of the &s;en&s;ory of my head, I can|not &s;ay; but while it did la&s;t, there could be nothing more &s;trange. To &s;ee two young people of different &s;exes, in the highe&s;t &s;pi|rits and mo&s;t confirmed health, live together for twenty-one days, perfectly plea&s;ed with each other, intirely at their own di&s;po&s;al, and as to fortune, having abundantly enough between them both for a comfortable life; and yet, never utter one word, nor give a look, that could be con&s;trued a declaration of the pa&s;&s;ion, or a tendency towards a more intimate union; &mdash; to compleat that con|nexion which nature and providence requires of beings circum&s;tanced as we were; &mdash; this was very odd. Till the clock &s;truck twelve every night we &s;at up, and talked of a va&s;t variety of things, from the Bible down to the clouds of Ari&s;tophanes, and from the comedies and tragedies of Greece and Rome to the Minerva of Sanctius, and Hickes's northern The&s;aurus. In&s;tead of Venus or any of her court, our conver&s;ation would often be on the morals of Cicero, his aca|demicks,
<PB N="97" REF="112">and de finibus; on the Engli&s;h or the Roman hi&s;tory; Shake&s;pear's &s;cenes of nature, or maps of life; whether the OEdipus or the Electra of Sophocles was the be&s;t tra|gedy; and the &s;cenes in which Plautus and Terence mo&s;t excelled.

<P><LABEL>Mi&s;s Mel|moth's character.</LABEL> Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> had a memory a&s;toni&s;h|ing, and talked on every &s;ubject extreme|ly well. She remembred all &s;he had read. Her judgment was &s;trong, and her re|flections ever good. She told me her mo|ther was another Mrs. <HI>Dacier,</HI> and as her father was killed in a duel, when &s;he was very young, the widow <HI>Melmoth,</HI> in&s;tead of going into the world, continued to live at her country &s;eat, and diverted her&s;elf with teaching her daughter the languages of Greece and Rome, and in educating her heart and mind. This made this young lady a ma&s;ter of the Latin tongue and Greek, and enable her to acquire a knowledge &s;o various and fine, that it was &s;urpriz|ing to hear her expatiate and explain. She talked with &s;o much ea&s;e and good humour, and had a manner &s;o chearful and polite, that her di&s;cour&s;e was always entertaining, even tho' the &s;ubject happened to be, as it was one evening, the paulo
<PB N="98" REF="113">paulo po&s;t futurum of a Greek verb. The&s;e things however were not the only admirable ones in this character. So happily had her good mother formed and in&s;tructed her mind, that it appeared full of all the princi|ples of rational honour, and devoted to that truly God-like religion, which exalts the &s;oul to an affection rather than dread of the &s;u|preme Lord of all things, and to a conviction that his laws lead us both to happine&s;s here and hereafter. She thorowly under&s;tood the u&s;e and excellence of Revelation, and had extracted from the in&s;pired volumes ever|la&s;ting comfort and &s;ecurity under the appre|hen&s;ions of the divine Power and Maje&s;ty: but &s;he told me, &s;he could not think rites and outward performances were e&s;&s;ential to real religion. She con&s;idered what was ju&s;t and beautiful in the&s;e things as u&s;eful and a&s;&s;i&s;ting only to the devout mind.&mdash;In a word, this young lady was wi&s;e and good, humble and charitable.

<HEAD>21. A journey among the hills, in that part of Stainmore, which be|longs to We&s;tmor|land. 1725, June 8.</HEAD>
<P> Having thus lo&s;t my charming com|panion, I travelled into a va&s;t valley, en|clo&s;ed by mountains who&s;e tops were above the clouds, and &s;oon came into a country that is wilder than the Campagna of Rome, or the uncultivated vales of the Alps and Apennines. Warm with a cla&s;&s;ical enthu|&s;ia&s;m, I journeyed on, and with fancy's eye beheld the <HI>rural divinities,</HI> in tho&s;e &s;acred woods and groves, which &s;hade the &s;ides of many of the va&s;t &s;urrounding fells, and the &s;hores and promontories of many lovely lakes and bright running &s;treams. For &s;everal hours I travelled over mountains tremendous to behold, and through vales the fine&s;t in the world. Not a man or hou&s;e could I &s;ee in eight hours time, but towards five in the afternoon, there appeared at the foot of
<PB N="101" REF="116">a hill a &s;weetly &s;ituated cottage, that was half covered with trees, and &s;tood by the &s;ide of a large falling &s;tream: a vale extended to the &s;outh from the door, that was termi|nated with rocks, and precipices on preci|pices, in an amazing point of view, and through the flowery ground, the water was beautifully &s;een, as it winded to a deeper flood at the bottom of the vale. Half a dozen cows were grazing in view: and a few flocks of feeding &s;heep added to the beauties of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>To this hou&s;e I &s;ent my boy, to enquire who lived there, and to know, if for the night I could be entertained, as I knew not where el&s;e to go. <HI>O' Fin</HI> very quickly re|turned, and informed me, that one farmer <HI>Price</HI> was the owner of the place, but had gone in the morning to the next town, and that his wife &s;aid, I was welcome to what her hou&s;e afforded. In then I went, and was mo&s;t civilly received by an exceeding pretty woman, who told me her hu&s;band would &s;oon be at home, and be glad &s;he was &s;ure to &s;ee me at their lone place; for he was no &s;tranger to gentlemen and the world, tho' at pre&s;ent he rarely conver&s;ed with any one. She told me, their own &s;upper would be ready an hour hence, and in mean time would have me take a can of fine ale and a bit of bread. She brought me a cup
<PB N="102" REF="117">of extraordinary mault-drink and a cru&s;t, and while I was eating my bread, in came Mr. <HI>Price.</HI></P>

<HEAD>22. A &s;urpriz|ing meeting</HEAD>
<P> The man &s;eemed very greatly a&s;to|ni&s;hed at entering the room, and after he had looked with great earne&s;tne&s;s at me for a little while, he cryed out, Good Heaven! What do I &s;ee! <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> my cla&s;s-fellow, and my &s;econd &s;elf. My dear friend you are welcome, thrice welcome to this part of the world. All this &s;urprized me not a little, for I could not recollect at once a face that had been greatly altered by the &s;mall-pox: And it was not till I reflected on the name <HI>Price</HI> that I knew I was then in the hou&s;e of one of my &s;chool-fellows, with whom I had been mo&s;t intimate, and had played the part of <HI>Plump Jack</HI> in <HI>Henry the fourth,</HI> when he did <HI>Prince Henry.</HI> This was an unexpected meeting indeed: and con|&s;idering the place, and all the circum&s;tances belonging to the &s;cene, a thing more &s;trange and affecting never came in my way. Our plea&s;ure at this meeting was very great, and when the mo&s;t affectionate &s;alutations were over, my friend <HI>Price</HI> proceeded in the fol|lowing manner.</P>
<P>Often have I remembered you &s;ince we parted, and exclu&s;ive of the Greek and Engli&s;h plays we have acted together at <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s &s;chool, in which you acquired no
<PB N="103" REF="118">&s;mall applau&s;e, I have frequently thought of our frolick&s;ome rambles in vacation time, and the merry dancings we had at Mother Red-Cap's in Back-Lane; the hurling matches we have played at Dolphin's-Barn, and the cakes and ale we u&s;ed to have at the Organ-hou&s;e on Arbor-Hill. The&s;e things have often occurred to my mind: but little did I think we &s;hould ever meet again on <HI>Stainmore-hills.</HI> What &s;trange things does time produce! It has taken me from a town life to live on the mo&s;t &s;olitary part of the globe:&mdash; And it has brought you to journey where never man I believe ever thought of travelling before. So it is, (I replyed), and &s;tranger things, dear <HI>Jack,</HI> may happen yet before our eyes are clo&s;ed: why I journey this untravelled way, I will inform you by and by; when you have told me by what &s;trange means you came to dwell in this remote and &s;ilent vale. That you &s;hall know, (Mr. <HI>Price</HI> &s;aid) very &s;oon, as &s;oon as we have eaten a mor&s;el of &s;omething or other which my dear <HI>Martha</HI> has prepared again&s;t my return. Here it comes, a fowl, bacon and greens, and as fine I will an&s;wer as London market could yield. Let us &s;it down, my friend, and God ble&s;s us and our meat.</P>
<P>Down then we &s;at immediatly to our di&s;h, and mo&s;t excellent every thing was.
<PB N="104" REF="119">The &s;ocial goodne&s;s of this fond couple ad|ded greatly to the plea&s;ure of the meal, and with mirth and friend&s;hip we eat up our capon, our bacon, and our greens. When we had done, <HI>Price</HI> brought in pipes and tobacco, and a fre&s;h tankard of his admi|rable ale. Li&s;ten now (he &s;aid) to my &s;tory, and then I will hearken to yours.</P>

<HEAD>23. The &s;tory of Jack Price.</HEAD>
<P> When I left you at <HI>Sheridan</HI>'s &s;chool, my remove was from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> to become a rich uncle's heir, and I got by my Indian airing a hundred thou&s;and pounds. There I left the bones of my mother's bro|ther, after I had lived two years in that burning place, and from thence proceeded to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;pend what an hone&s;t, labo|rious man had long toiled to &s;ave. But I had not been above three months in the ca|pital of England, when it came into my head to pa&s;s &s;ome time in France, and with a girl I kept made ha&s;t to the French me|tropolis. There I lived at a grand rate, and took from the French Opera-hou&s;e another where. The <HI>Gaul</HI> and the <HI>Briton</HI> were both extreme fine girls, and agreed &s;o well toge|ther, that I kept them both in one hou&s;e. I thought my &s;elf &s;uperlatively happy in hav|ing &s;uch a brace of females, and &s;pared no co&s;t in procuring them all the finery and plea&s;ures that <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>London</HI> could yield. I had a furni&s;hed hou&s;e in both the&s;e cities,
<PB N="105" REF="120">and with an expen&s;ive equipage went back|wards and forwards. In four years time I &s;pent a great deal of money, and as I had lo&s;t large &s;ums at play, and the&s;e two whores agreed in the end to rob me, and retire with the money, where I &s;hould never di&s;cover them, I found my &s;elf in very mid|ling circum&s;tances, and had not &s;ix hun|dred pounds left in the fourth year from my uncle's death. How to di&s;po&s;e of this and my &s;elf was now the que&s;tion. What &s;hall I do, (was my deliberation) to &s;ecure bread and quiet? Many a thoughtful hour this gave me, and at length I determined to purcha&s;e a little annuity. But before this could be effected, I went down to <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> on an information I had received, that my two ladies were at <HI>Appleby</HI> with other names, and on my money appeared as women of for|tune. But this journey was to no purpo&s;e, and I was preparing to return to London, when my wife you &s;aw at the head of the table a while ago, came by chance in my way, and plea&s;ed me &s;o well with her good under&s;tanding, face and per&s;on, that I re|&s;olved to marry her, if &s;he would have me, and give her the management of my five hundred pounds on a farm, as &s;he was a farmer's daughter, and could manage one to good advantage. Her father was
<PB N="106" REF="121">lately dead, and this little mountain farm &s;he continued to occupy: therefore nothing could be more to my purpo&s;e, if I could pre|vail on her to make me her hu&s;band, and with &s;ome difficulty &s;he did, to my un&s;peak|able felicity. She had no money worth mentioning: but her hou&s;e was pretty and comfortable, and her land had grain and cattle; and as I threw into her lap my five hundred pounds, a little before we were married, to be by her di&s;po&s;ed of and ma|naged, according to her plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;oon made &s;ome good improvements and additions, and by her fine under&s;tanding, &s;weet tem|per, and every Chri&s;tian virtue, continues to render my life &s;o compleatly happy; &s;o joyous and delightful; that I would not change my partner and condition, for one of the fir&s;t quality and greate&s;t fortune. In her I have every thing I could wi&s;h for in a wife and a woman, and &s;he makes it the &s;ole &s;tudy and plea&s;ure of her life to crown my every day with the highe&s;t &s;atisfactions and comforts. Two years have I lived with her on the&s;e wild mountains, and in that time I have not had one dull or painful minute, but in thinking that I may lo&s;e her, and be the wretched &s;urvivor. That thought does &s;ometimes wound me. &mdash; In &s;um, my friend, we are the happie&s;t of wedded mor|tals, and on this &s;mall, remote farm, live
<PB N="107" REF="122">in a &s;tate of bli&s;s to be envyed. This proves that happine&s;s does not flow from riches on|ly: but that, where pure and perfect love, &s;trict virtue, and uncea&s;ing indu&s;try, are united in the conjugal &s;tate, they can make the Stainmore mountains a Paradice to mor|tals, in <HI>peace and little.</HI></P>
<P>But it is not only happine&s;s in this world that I have acquired by this admirable wo|man, but life eternal. You remember, my friend, what a wild and wicked one I was when a &s;chool-boy, and as <HI>Barbadoes</HI> of all parts of the globe is no place to improve a man's morals in, I returned from thence to <HI>Europe</HI> as debauched a &s;celerate as ever of|fended Heaven by bla&s;phemy and illegal gra|tifications. Even my lo&s;&s;es and approaching poverty were not capable of making any great change in me. When I was courting my wife, &s;he &s;oon di&s;cerned my impiety, and perceived that I had very little notion of hell and heaven, death and judgment. This &s;he made a principal objection again&s;t being concerned with me, and told me, &s;he could not venture into a married connexion with a man, who had no regard to the divine laws, and therefore, if &s;he could not make me a Chri&s;tian, in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;he would never be Mrs. <HI>Price.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="123">This from a plain, country girl, &s;urprized me not a little, and my a&s;toni&s;hment aro&s;e very high, when I heard her talk of religion, and the great end of both, a ble&s;&s;ed life after this. She &s;oon convinced me, that religion was the only means by which we can arrive at true happine&s;s, by which we can attain to the la&s;t perfection and dignity of our na|ture, and that the authority and word of God is the &s;ure&s;t foundation of religion. The &s;ub&s;tance of what &s;he &s;aid is as follows. I &s;hall never forget the le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>The plain <HI>declarations</HI> of our <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> re&s;tore the dictates of <HI>uncorrupted rea&s;on</HI> to their force and authority, and give us ju&s;t notions of God and of our &s;elves. They in&s;truct us in the nature of the Deity, di&s;cover to us his unity, holine&s;s, and purity, and afford certain means of obtaining eternal life. Revelation commands us to wor&s;hip <HI>One Supreme God,</HI> the <HI>Supreme Father</HI> of all things; and to do his will, by imitating his perfections, and practi&s;ing every thing re|commended by that <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> which he &s;ent the Me&s;&s;iah to revive and enforce: that by repentance, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and acts of devotion, we may obtain the Divine favor, and &s;hare in the glories of futurity: for, the <HI>Supreme Director,</HI> who&s;e <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> gives coun&s;el to his <HI>power,</HI> commanded us into exi&s;tence to conduct us to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and therefore, teaches us by his
<PB N="109" REF="124">Son to pray, to prai&s;e, and to repent, that we may be entitled to a nobler inheritance than this world knows, and obtain life and immortality, and all the joys and ble&s;&s;ings of the heavenly Canaan. This was the <HI>god|like</HI> de&s;ign of our <HI>Creator.</HI> That <HI>&s;uperior Agent,</HI> who acts not by arbitrary will, but by the maxims of unclouded rea&s;on, when he made us, and &s;tationed us in this part of his creation, had no glory of his own in view, but what was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t regard to the felicity of his rational &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It was this made the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;hew <HI>Felix</HI> the unalterable obligations to <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>equity;</HI> to <HI>temperance,</HI> or, a command over the appetites; and then, by di&s;playing the great and awful judgment to come, urge him to the practice of the&s;e, and all the other branches of morality; that by u&s;ing the means pre&s;cribed by God, and acting up to the conditions of &s;alvation, he might e&s;cape that dreadful puni&s;hment, which, in the rea&s;on and nature of things, is connected with vice, and which the good government of the rational world requires &s;hould be in|flicted on the wicked; and might, on the contrary, by that mercy offered to the world thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ecure tho&s;e <HI>immen&s;e re|wards,</HI> which are promi&s;ed to <HI>innocence</HI> and the <HI>te&s;timony of an upright heart.</HI> This <HI>faith
<PB N="110" REF="125">in Chri&s;t St. Paul</HI> placed before the <HI>Roman</HI> governor in the be&s;t light. He de&s;cribed the complexion and genius of the <HI>Chri&s;tian faith.</HI> He repre&s;ented it as reveling the <HI>wrath</HI> of God again&s;t all <HI>immorality;</HI> and as joining with rea&s;on and uncorrupted nature, enforc|ing the practice of every moral and &s;ocial duty.</P>
<P>What effect this di&s;cour&s;e had on <HI>Felix</HI> (<HI>Martha</HI> continued) in producing <HI>faith,</HI> that is, <HI>morality</HI> in an <HI>intelligent agent,</HI> we are told by the <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI> He <HI>trembled:</HI> but ini|quity and the world had taken &s;uch a hold of him, that he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject, and turned from a pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s to profit and the enjoyment of &s;in. He had done with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and &s;acrificed the hopes of eter|nity to the world and its delights.</P>
<P>But this (concluded <HI>Martha</HI>) will not I hope be your ca&s;e. As a <HI>judgment to come</HI> is an awful &s;ubject, you will ponder in time, and look into your own mind. As a man, a rea&s;onable and &s;ocial creature, de&s;igned for <HI>duty</HI> to a God above you, and to a world of <HI>fellow-creatures</HI> around you, you will con|&s;ider the rules of virtue and morality, and be no longer numbered with tho&s;e mi&s;erable mortals, who are doomed to condemnation upon their di&s;obedience. Tho&s;e rules lie open in a perfect go&s;pel, and the wicked can have nothing to plead for their behaviour.
<PB N="111" REF="126">They want no light to direct them. They want no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport them in doing their duty. They have a <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to bring them to <HI>life</HI> and <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> if they will but take notice of it; and if they will not walk in the light of God's law, this <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> mu&s;t be their <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Say then, Sir, (<HI>Martha</HI> proceeded) can you be prevailed on to think of religion in its native purity and &s;implicity, and by the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;o act with regard to virtue and piety, that when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come not only in the power, but in the wi&s;dom and the ju&s;tice of God, to judge the world, you may be &s;ecured from that mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, which is prepared for iniquity; and enjoy that eternal life, which is to be the portion of the righteous?</P>
<P>In this extraordinary manner did Martha Harrington di&s;cour&s;e me, and the effect of it was (Jack Price continued), that I be|came a thorow reform from that hour. My rational life from that happy day commenced, and I entred &s;eriou&s;ly into my own brea&s;t, to think in earne&s;t of that <HI>&s;olemn judgment</HI> to come. What <HI>Martha</HI> &s;aid was &s;o clear and &s;trong, that I had not a thought of reply|ing, but truth at once intirely &s;ubdued my heart, and I flew to the Son of God, to re|que&s;t his interce&s;&s;ion with the Father of the Univer&s;e for the pardon of all my crimes.
<PB N="112" REF="127">The dignity and end of my being has &s;ince been the &s;ubject of my meditations, and I live convinced, that every thing is contemp|tible that is incon&s;i&s;tent with duty and mo|rality. This renders even my plea&s;ures more agreeable. This gives eternal peace to my mind.</P>

<HEAD>24. A conver|&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P> Here <HI>Price</HI> ended his remarkable &s;tory, and according to our agreement, I began to relate what happened to me from the time we parted at &s;chool, and concluded with informing him, that I was going in &s;earch of <HI>Charles Turner,</HI> my near friend, when fortune brought me to his hou&s;e: that this gentleman lived &s;omewhere towards the confines of Cumberland and the North-riding of York&s;hire, but where the &s;pot was I could not tell, nor did I know well how to go on, as the country before me &s;eemed unpa&s;&s;able, on account of its mountains, precipices, and floods: I mu&s;t try however what can be done; not only in regard to this gentleman; but, becau&s;e I have rea|&s;on to think it may be very much to my advantage, as he is very rich, and the mo&s;t generous of men. If he is to be found, I know I &s;hall be welcome to &s;hare in his happine&s;s as long as I plea&s;e, nor will it be any weight to him. <HI>Price</HI> to this replyed, that I was mo&s;t heartily welcome to him as long as I plea&s;ed to
<PB N="113" REF="128">&s;tay, and that tho' he was far from being a rich man, yet he had every day enough for him&s;elf and one more; and his <HI>Martha</HI> he was &s;ure would be as well plea&s;ed with my com|pany, as if I had been his own brother, &s;ince &s;he knew I was his e&s;teemed friend. &mdash;In re&s;pect of the way, he &s;aid, he would enable me to find Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> if he could, but the country was difficult to travel, and he doubted very much if one could go to the extremity of <HI>Cumberland</HI> or <HI>York&s;hire</HI> over the hills; but we would try how|ever, and if it was po&s;&s;ible, find out Mr. <HI>Turner</HI>'s hou&s;e. Yet &s;olely with him I mu&s;t not &s;tay, if he could be &s;een. I mu&s;t live between both, till I got &s;ome Northern girl, and had a wife and habitation of my own; and there is (continued <HI>Price</HI>) not many miles from me, a &s;weet pretty la&s;s, the daughter of a gentleman-farmer, who is a very good man, and would, I believe, upon my recommendation, give you his girl, and a &s;um of money, to &s;it down on tho&s;e hills.&mdash;This is va&s;tly kind, <HI>Jack,</HI> I an|&s;wering, &s;aid, and what I &s;hall gratefully re|member &s;o long as I live. I may ride ma|ny a mile I am &s;ure, and be an adven|turer many a long day, before I meet with &s;uch offers again. Your &s;weetly &s;ituated hou&s;e and good things, with a fine nor|thern girl and money down, are benefits
<PB N="114" REF="129">not to be met with every day.&mdash;But at pre|&s;ent the object I mu&s;t pur&s;ue, is my uni|ver&s;ity friend, <HI>Charles Turner,</HI> and if you plea&s;e to do me the great favor of guiding me &s;o far as you can over this wild, un|inhabited land, after I have &s;tayed with you, for the fir&s;t time, two or three days, and promi&s;e to abide many more hereaf|ter, if it be in my power, we will &s;et out in que&s;t of what I want. As you will, my friend <HI>Price</HI> replyed: and for the pre|&s;ent, let us be gay. Here comes my belo|ved, with a little bowl of punch, and as &s;he &s;ings extremely well, and you have not forgot I fan&s;y our old &s;ong, we will have it over our nectar.

<HEAD>26. An account of Mrs. Price of Stanemore.</HEAD>
<P> In this happy manner did we pa&s;s the night in this wild and frightful part of the world, and for three &s;ucceeding even|ings and days, enjoyed as much true &s;a|tisfaction as it was po&s;&s;ible for mortals to feel. <HI>Price</HI> was an ingenious, chearful, en|tertaining man, and his wife had not on|ly &s;en&s;e more than ordinary, but was one of the be&s;t of women. I was prodigi|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed with her conver&s;ation. Tho' &s;he was no woman of letters, nor had any books in her hou&s;e except the <HI>Bible, Barrow</HI>'s and <HI>Wichcott</HI>'s &s;ermons, <HI>Howell</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World,</HI> and the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Eng|land,</HI> yet from the&s;e few, a great memo|ry, and an extraordinary conception of things, had collected a valuable knowledge, and &s;he talked with an ea&s;e and per&s;picuity that was wonderful. On religious &s;ubjects &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed me.</P>
<P><LABEL>The nature, end, and de&s;ign of chri&s;tiani|ty, con&s;i|dered in a conver&s;a|tion.</LABEL> As Sunday was one of the days I &s;tayed there,  and <HI>Price</HI> was obliged in the afternoon to be from home, I pa&s;&s;ed it in conver&s;ation with his wife. The day introduced religion,
<PB N="120" REF="135">and among other things, I a&s;ked her, which &s;he thought the be&s;t evidences of chri&s;tianity? The <HI>prophecies</HI> or the <HI>miracles?</HI></P>
<P>Neither: (Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> replyed). The <HI>prophecies</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> recorded in the old te&s;tament are a good proof of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, as it is plane from many in&s;tances in the new te&s;tament, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h converts</HI> of that generation under&s;tood them to relate to our Lord; which is a &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on for our believing them. Since they knew the true intent and meaning of them, and on account of their know|ing it, were converted; the <HI>prophecies</HI> for this rea&s;on &s;hould by us be regarded as <HI>divine te&s;timony</HI> in favor of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Then as to <HI>miracles,</HI> they are to be &s;ure a means of proving and &s;preading the chri&s;tian religion, as they &s;hew the <HI>divine mi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and rouze the mind to attend to the pow|er by which the&s;e mighty works were wrought. Thus <HI>miracle</HI> and <HI>prophecy</HI> &s;hew the <HI>teacher came from God.</HI> They contribute to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his kingdom, and have a tendency to produce that faith which puri|fies the heart, and brings forth the new birth.</P>
<P>But the greater evidence for the truth of our holy religion, appears to me to be that which converted the primitive chri&s;tians, to wit, the <HI>powerful influence</HI> which the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> has on the minds of tho&s;e who &s;tudy
<PB N="121" REF="136">it with &s;incerity, and the <HI>inward di&s;coveries</HI> Chri&s;t makes to the under&s;tanding of the faithful by his light and good &s;pirit. This exceeds the other evidences, if the heart be hone&s;t. The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is irre&s;i&s;tible, when the <HI>&s;pirit of God moves</HI> upon the minds of chri&s;tians. When the <HI>divine power,</HI> di&s;|pen&s;ed <HI>through Chri&s;t,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts and &s;trength|ens us to do good, and to e&s;chew evil, then chri&s;tianity appears a religion wor|thy of God, and in it&s;elf the mo&s;t rea|&s;onable. The compleat &s;alvation de&s;erves our ready acceptation. That religion mu&s;t charm a rea&s;onable world, which not only re&s;tores the wor&s;hip of the <HI>one true God,</HI> and exhibits, in a perfect plan, tho&s;e rules of moral rectitude, whereby the conduct of men &s;hould be governed, and their future happine&s;s &s;ecured; but, by its <HI>ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit,</HI> informs our judgments, influences our wills, rectifies and &s;ubdues our pa&s;&s;ions, turns the bia&s;s of our minds from the ob|jects and plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, and fixes them upon the <HI>&s;upreme good.</HI> Mo&s;t glorious &s;ure|ly is &s;uch a go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But does not this <HI>operation of the &s;pirit,</HI> (I &s;aid) which you make the principal evidence for chri&s;tianity, deba&s;e human na|ture, and make man too weak, too helple&s;s and depending a being? If <HI>voluntary good agency</HI> depends on <HI>&s;upernatural influence</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="137">and <HI>enlivening aid,</HI> does not this make us <HI>mere patients,</HI> and if we are not <HI>moral a|gents,</HI> that is, have not a power of chu&s;ing or refu&s;ing, of doing or avoiding, either <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evil,</HI> can there be any human virtue? Can we in &s;uch ca&s;e <HI>approve</HI> or <HI>di&s;approve</HI> our|&s;elves to God. To me it &s;eems that man was created to perform things <HI>natural, ratio|nal,</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> and has an ability to act within the reach of his agency, as his duty requires. I think the <HI>moral fit|ne&s;s of things</HI> is a <HI>rule</HI> of action to conduct our actions by, and that the great advantage of revelation con&s;i&s;ts in its heavenly moral le&s;|&s;ons, and the certainty of that <HI>future judg|ment</HI> and <HI>retribution,</HI> which has a power|ful influence upon a rational mind, and &s;trongly inclines a rea&s;onable being to <HI>&s;ave his &s;oul,</HI> by &s;o acting in this world, as to a|void everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, and en&s;ure the favor of God, and eternal happine&s;s in another world. This appears to me more con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>nature</HI> and the <HI>truth</HI> of <HI>things.</HI> It is more to the honour of hu|man nature, if I mi&s;take not, and gives more glory to God.</P>
<P>To this Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> an&s;wered, that as &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;hortne&s;s of her own under&s;tanding, and believed the fa|culties of the human mind in general were weak and deficient, &s;he could not &s;ee any thing unrea&s;onable in &s;uppo&s;ing the
<PB N="123" REF="138">thing formed depended on, and was &s;ubject to the Creator that made it. It cannot be ab|&s;urd &s;urely to &s;ay, that &s;o weak and helple&s;s a being as a man, depends intirely on God. Where in the nature of things can we fix a &s;tandard of certainty in under&s;tanding, and &s;tability in practice, but in the fountain of truth, and all perfection?</P>
<P>But to our better comprehending this mat|ter, let us take a view of primitive Chri&s;tian religion.&mdash;<HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is a divine in&s;titution, by which God declares him&s;elf reconciled to mankind for the <HI>&s;ake</HI> of his beloved &s;on, the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> on condition of <HI>repentance, amendment of life,</HI> and <HI>per&s;everance in a &s;tate of holine&s;s;</HI> and that we might be able to per|form the things required of us, he offers the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his good &s;pirit. This la&s;t offer, in a proper &s;en&s;e, is &s;alvation; <HI>for according to his mercy, he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t. By grace are ye &s;aved thro' faith, and that not of your&s;elves; it is the gift of God.</HI> We find, then, that there are two parts in the Chri&s;tian religion: one, <HI>external and hi&s;torical;</HI> the other, <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>expe|rimental.</HI> The fir&s;t comprehends what is no more to be repeated, tho' the effects are la&s;t|ing and permanent, to wit, the life and good works of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his miracles, death, and re|&s;urrection; which declare him <HI>&s;potle&s;s virtue,
<PB N="124" REF="139">perfect obedience,</HI> and the <HI>&s;on of God with power:</HI>&mdash;And in the &s;econd part, we have that &s;tanding experience of a <HI>divine help,</HI> which converts and &s;upports a &s;piritual life: It is true, both the parts have a near relation, and in conjunction produce the good ends of religion. The &s;econd is the effect of the fir&s;t. Redemption from the power of &s;in, &s;anctifi|cation, and ju&s;tification, are ble&s;&s;ings <HI>wrought in us</HI> by the <HI>good Spirit</HI> of him, who <HI>without us</HI> did many glorious things, <HI>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works:</HI> And, <HI>that they who live, &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him that died for them and ro&s;e again.</HI> But, it is in the &s;econd part, that the excellence of our holy religion con&s;i&s;ts. We have no ability of our&s;elves to take off our minds from the things that are evil, and engage them in the work of reli|gion and godline&s;s. This is the <HI>gift</HI> of God. It is a <HI>continued miracle</HI> that clean&s;es that pol|luted fountain the heart, and therefore I call this <HI>experience</HI> the principal evidence of the Chri&s;tian religion. It is the glory of chri&s;tianity, and renders it the perfection of all religions.</P>
<P>That chri&s;tianity (I replyed) is the per|fection of all religions, is granted, but that we have no ability to &s;ave our &s;ouls without a <HI>&s;upernatural operation</HI> on them, this is what I &s;till have &s;ome doubt of. A careful exami|nation
<PB N="125" REF="140">of the &s;ubject, produces &s;ome hard objections, and therefore, madam, I will lay my difficulties before you, that your fine na|tural under&s;tanding may remove them, if it be po&s;&s;ible. I will be &s;hort on the article, for many words would only darken it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, as to man's <HI>inabi|lity</HI> to live a religious life, and practice the precepts of the go&s;pel, it mu&s;t be the effect of the <HI>human compo&s;ition,</HI> or the effect of the agency of the <HI>&s;erpent.</HI> If the former, it is chargeable upon the author of the compo|&s;ition; &mdash;if the latter, upon the agent which acts upon it. Man could not be cul|pable, I think, for a bad life, in either ca&s;e. &mdash;If my nature be weakne&s;s it&s;elf&mdash;or the &s;erpent is &s;uperior to me&mdash;what good can be required of me? can the &s;upreme rea&s;on call for <HI>brick,</HI> where there are no materials to make it with? will you &s;ay, yes; becau&s;e he gives <HI>&s;upernatural ability</HI> to perform. But then, can this be called man's action? It is the action of the author by his mi&s;erable creature, man: and in &s;uch ca&s;e, may we not &s;ay, that tho' <HI>commands</HI> are given to <HI>man</HI> to obey revealed laws, yet the <HI>obedience</HI> is performed by <HI>God?</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, as man in his <HI>natural capacity,</HI> and all his <HI>natural powers,</HI> are the work of God, and as <HI>truly derived</HI> from him as any <HI>&s;upernatural powers</HI> can be, it follows,
<PB N="126" REF="141">I imagine, that a <HI>voluntary agent</HI>'s making a right u&s;e of the <HI>powers of his nature,</HI> is as <HI>valuable</HI> as his being <HI>compelled</HI> to act well and wi&s;ely by a &s;upernatural power. To a&s;&s;ert, then, &s;uch <HI>experiences</HI> or <HI>operations,</HI> to me &s;eems to <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ent</HI> the nature of a being excellently con&s;tituted to an&s;wer the good purpo&s;es he was created for. I am likewi&s;e, at pre&s;ent, of opinion, that <HI>depretiating our natural abilities,</HI> does not give &s;o much glory to God as you imagine.</P>
<P>To this Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> replyed, that by the <HI>operation</HI> of the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> &s;he did not mean that man was purely pa&s;&s;ive, and had no part in the working out his &s;alvation, but that God <HI>co-operates</HI> with <HI>man,</HI> and without de&s;troying the faculty of rea&s;on, improves it by con|vincing and enlightning the under&s;tanding, and by moving and inclining the will towards &s;uch objects as are acceptable to him&s;elf, and from tho&s;e that are contrary to his go&s;pel. The mind in this manner enlightned and af|fected, begins to act, and as the &s;pirit moves upon the &s;oul, the quickened man, under the divine direction, does all the good the &s;cripture commands him to do, and e&s;chews the evil he is ordered to avoid. By God thro' Chri&s;t, he practices the excellent virtues re|commended in the holy books, and for this rea&s;on, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which chri&s;tians bring forth, is called in &s;cripture, the right|eou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="127" REF="142">of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith. Chri&s;t is the efficient. We thro' him are made able to act. Notwith&s;tanding the weakne&s;s and incapacity of our nature, yet <HI>thro' faith in the power of God,</HI> which is given to all who believe in him, we are enabled to flee immorality and vice, and by a life of virtue and piety, to enjoy the plea&s;ure of a &s;weet reflexion, and the prai&s;es of unpolluted rea&s;on.</P>
<P>That this is the ca&s;e of man, the &s;acred writings declare in a thou&s;and places, and &s;et forth the exceeding greatne&s;s of God's power in this re&s;pect. The mini&s;try of the go&s;pel appears to have been ordained for this end, and the perfection of the chri&s;tian religion, to re&s;t on this particular thing. <HI>The Lord died for our &s;ins, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tifi|cation, that we through power received from him, (the power of his re&s;urrection) might be made righteous.</HI> And the apo&s;tle adds, <HI>I am not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for it is the power of God unto &s;alvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek, for therein is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God revealed from faith to faith.</HI> And that the promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t had reference not only to the great effu&s;ion of the Spirit at <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> which was a &s;olemn confirmation of the new and &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation of the
<PB N="128" REF="143">go&s;pel; but al&s;o to that in&s;truction which Chri&s;tians of every age were to receive from it continually, if they attended to it, is evi|dent from the promi&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,&mdash;I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another comforter,</HI> (the &s;pirit of truth) <HI>that he may abide with you for ever.</HI> This &s;pirit was to &s;upply the place of his per&s;onal pre&s;ence. It was to become a teacher and comforter to his di&s;ciples and followers to the end of time&mdash; to enlighten and incline their minds to piety and virtue&mdash;to enable them to do all things appertaining to life and godline&s;s, and to have a faith in God's power and all-&s;ufficiency. This is the glorious &s;pecific difference of Chri&s;tianity from all other religions. We have an inward in&s;tructor and &s;upporter al|ways abiding with us. And what can be a higher honor to mankind, or an act of greater love in God, than for him to interpo&s;e con|tinually, and by his holy Spirit re&s;tore the teachable and attentive to that purity and up|rightne&s;s in which he at fir&s;t created man? Glorious di&s;pen&s;ation! Here is a compleat reparation of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion. We are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and are made partakers of the divine nature. Surely this is the utmo&s;t that can be expected from religion. In &s;hort, (continued Mrs. <HI>Price</HI>) it is to me a mo&s;t amazing thing, to &s;ee men of &s;en&s;e di&s;claim this <HI>help,</HI> argue for
<PB N="129" REF="144"><HI>&s;elf-&s;ufficiency</HI> and <HI>independency,</HI> and receive only the <HI>outward appearance</HI> of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> in a literal, hi&s;torical, and formal pro|fe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity! This will never do the work. The <HI>outward appearance</HI> of the <HI>Son of God</HI> only puts us in a <HI>capacity of &s;alvation:</HI> it is the <HI>inward appearance</HI> by the power and virtue of the &s;pirit that mu&s;t <HI>&s;ave</HI> us. The <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> is <HI>repentance, forgivene&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> and <HI>amendment of manners;</HI> and the <HI>means</HI> of obtaining that end, is <HI>chri&s;tianity in the life, &s;pirit and power of it.</HI></P>
<P>You talk extremely well, madam, (I &s;aid) upon this &s;ubject, and have almo&s;t made me a convert to the notion of an <HI>inward appear|ance</HI> of the <HI>Son of God:</HI> but I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve to you, that as to what you have added, by way of explication and vin|dication of the <HI>operation</HI> of the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> to wit, that man has <HI>agency,</HI> and God <HI>co-operates</HI> with it, by which means the man is enabled to apply his agency to the performance of good; this does not &s;eem to me to make the matter quite plain. The virtue or goodne&s;s of an <HI>agent</HI> mu&s;t certainly ari&s;e from a right exerci&s;e of his own power, and how then can God's <HI>co-operating</HI> with him make him a better man? Can &s;uch <HI>co-operation</HI> add any thing to my virtue, if my goodne&s;s is to be rated in proportion to the exertion of my own will and agency. If I am not able to &s;ave a
<PB N="130" REF="145">man from drowning, tho' I pity him, and do my be&s;t to pre&s;erve his life; but God gives me &s;trength, or co-operates with me, and &s;o the man is &s;aved; can this add any thing to my virtue or goodne&s;s? It would be indeed an in&s;tance of God's goodne&s;s to the man; but as to my&s;elf, I did no more with the di|vine co-operation than I did without it. I made all the u&s;e I could of what power I had. This &s;eems to me a &s;trong objection again&s;t the <HI>inward appearance:</HI> nor is it all there is to object. If I &s;ee a man in a deep wet ditch, in a dangerous and mi&s;erable way, and am prompted by a natural affection, and the fit|ne&s;s of relieving, to exert a &s;ufficient &s;trength I have, to take the man out of his di&s;tre&s;s, and put him in a comfortable way; (which is a thing I really did once, and thereby &s;aved a u&s;eful life);&mdash;in this ca&s;e, there was good done by an <HI>agent,</HI> without any <HI>&s;upernatural co-operation</HI> at all: Many more in&s;tances might be produced: but from what has been &s;aid, is it not plain, that much good may be done without any interpo&s;ition;&mdash;and, with it, that no good can be added to the charac|ter of the agent?</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, perhaps, that the <HI>good di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the <HI>agent</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es, is <HI>&s;uper|natural operation,</HI> and without &s;uch operation, he could not make a right u&s;e of his ability. To this we reply, that if by <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> is

<PB N="134" REF="149">his heart, was only evil continually: and it re|pented the Lord, that he had made man on the earth, etc.</HI> 
And again;&mdash;<HI>The earth al&s;o was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence: and God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fle&s;h had corrupted his way on the earth. And God &s;aid unto Noah, the end of all fle&s;h is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence thro' them; and behold, I will de&s;troy them with the earth. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</HI>&mdash;The prophet Jeremiah does likewi&s;e affirm, <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares from P&s;alm 14 and 53. <HI>There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open &s;epulchre; with their tongues have they u&s;ed deceit; the poi&s;on of a&s;ps is under their lips: who&s;e mouth is full of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s.

<P>Then as to <HI>grace,</HI> or the <HI>operation of the Spirit,</HI> to cure this <HI>mi&s;erable condition of mankind, Peter &s;aid unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall re|ceive
<PB N="135" REF="150">the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, for the promi&s;e is unto you and your children, and to all that are afar off.</HI> This is a very exten&s;ive declaration both as to time and place. After <HI>Peter</HI> had told the people, <HI>the God of our fathers rai&s;ed up Je&s;us whom ye &s;lew, and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto I&s;rael, and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and we are his witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e things, and &s;o al&s;o is the Holy Gho&s;t, whom God hath given to them that obey him:</HI> the apo&s;tle adds, <HI>then they, (the Gentiles) were filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> All who obeyed, without di&s;tinction, had the Holy Gho&s;t given them, and it was a witne&s;s to them of the truth of Chri&s;t's divine mi&s;&s;ion, and the good effects of it, according to the promi&s;e of the Lord, to wit, <HI>he &s;hall te&s;tify of me.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> likewi&s;e tells us, <HI>if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his. And if Chri&s;t be in you, the body is dead becau&s;e of &s;in, but the &s;pirit is life, becau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s; but if the &s;pirit of him that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us from the dead, dwell in you, he that rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t from the dead, &s;hall al&s;o quicken your mortal bodies by his &s;pirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore brethren, we are debtors, not to the fle&s;h to live after the fle&s;h, for if ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die; but if ye thro' the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live. For
<PB N="136" REF="151">as many as are led by the &s;pirit of God, they are the &s;ons of God. For ye have not received the &s;pirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the &s;pirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father, the &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God.</HI>&mdash;Here we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of having the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and that tho&s;e who have it not, do not belong to him. They are none of his. We may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that it mortifies the deeds of the body, and quick|ens the &s;oul to a life of holine&s;s: the pa&s;&s;age likewi&s;e &s;hews, that the &s;pirit bears witne&s;s with our &s;pirits, and by an evidence peculiar to it&s;elf, gives us a certain &s;en&s;e, or under&s;tan|ding of it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, a great number of texts might be produced, to &s;hew not only the <HI>work</HI> and <HI>effect</HI> of the <HI>Divine &s;pirit</HI> upon our minds; but that, it is an <HI>evidence,</HI> the princi|pal evidence and ground of <HI>certainty</HI> to <HI>be|lievers,</HI> re&s;pecting the truth of chri&s;tianity. I will mention however only two or three more, and then &s;hall be glad to hear what you &s;ay to tho&s;e things.</P>
<P><HI>What man knoweth the &s;pirit of man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of man which is in him? even &s;o the things of God knoweth no man, but the &s;pirit of God. Now we have received not the &s;pirit of the world, but the &s;pirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely
<PB N="137" REF="152">given to us of God.&mdash;Ye have an unction from the Holy one, and ye know all things. The&s;e things have I written to you, concerning them that &s;educe you; but the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any teach you, but as the &s;ame anoin|ting teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye &s;hall abide in it.&mdash;Hereby we know that he abideth in us by his &s;pirit, which he hath given us. Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>What do you &s;ay to all this? do not the &s;acred pa&s;&s;ages I have repeated &s;eem to de|clare in the plane&s;t manner the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary iniquity</HI> of man; that this is to be cured only, and his nature rectified by the operation of the Divine &s;pirit; and that the <HI>effu&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> both as to <HI>in&s;truction</HI> and <HI>evidence,</HI> was not pe|culiar to the infancy of chri&s;tianity? This appears to my under&s;tanding. The very e&s;&s;ence of the chri&s;tian religion I think from the&s;e &s;criptures con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>ef|ficacy</HI> of the <HI>&s;piritual principle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The &s;tate of religion from the creation to this time.</HEAD>
<P>What you have &s;aid madam,  (I replied) &s;eems &s;trong indeed in defence of the <HI>weak|ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> and the <HI>operation</HI> of the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and I &s;hould be of your way of thinking as to the <HI>manife&s;tation</HI> of it, but that I imagine the thing may be explained in a different
<PB N="138" REF="153">manner. Let us review our religion, if you plea&s;e, and perhaps we may find, that a|nother account may be given of &s;anctification, and the renewing the mind into a &s;tate of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>When God called this world into being, his purpo&s;e was without all peradventure, that his rational creatures might enjoy the noble&s;t plea&s;ures, and by conforming their conduct to the fitne&s;s and relation of things, from a due regard to the authority of the fir&s;t cau&s;e, by whom this fitne&s;s and relation were wi&s;ely con&s;tituted, &s;ecure all the ble&s;s|ings of this life, and honour, and glory, and immortality, in &s;ome future &s;tate of exi&s;t|tence. This I think was the ca&s;e. True religion was to form and fix every good prin|ciple in the human mind, produce all righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the conver&s;ation, and thereby ren|der mankind the ble&s;&s;ed of the univer&s;al Father. They were to wor&s;hip the one true God; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all being, and the foun|tain of all good; to believe in him, and have their tru&s;t and dependence always on him; to be pure and peaceable, gentle and full of mercy, without partiality, without hypocri&s;y, and &s;o devoted to holine&s;s and obedience, to every virtue and every good work which the law of rea&s;on can require from men; that after a long life &s;pent in acting a part the mo&s;t honourable to God, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="154">advantageous to mankind, in <HI>obeying the dictates of rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>thereby imi|tating the example of God;</HI> they might be tran&s;lated to the regions of immortality and day, where the fir&s;t and great original di&s;|plays as it were face to face the perfections of the Deity, and from an all-perfect and holy being receive the va&s;t rewards he has prepa|red for tho&s;e, who, in this fir&s;t &s;tate, have been to all the purpo&s;es of life and religion, perfect as he is perfect. For the&s;e rea&s;ons did the &s;upreme director, the greate&s;t and the be&s;t Being in the univer&s;e, command the human race into exi&s;tence. He gave them faculties to conduct them here through various &s;cenes of happine&s;s to the realms of immortality and immutable felicity. It was a <HI>Godlike</HI> de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But it was not very long before this hu|man race became corrupt, and not only did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, but cea&s;ed to ap|prehend the <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e</HI> as <HI>one mo&s;t perfect mind.</HI> The natural notions of moral per|fection which rea&s;on and the light of nature &s;upply, they no longer minded, nor thought of what is fit and rea&s;onable to be done in every ca&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ions began to influence and direct their lives: ju&s;t and pure ideas of the Deity were lo&s;t, fal&s;e ones took place, and the mi&s;chief and its fatal con&s;equences became very great. It was a melancholy
<PB N="140" REF="155">&s;cene! The exalted notions of <HI>one glorious God,</HI> and of that true religion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the expectation of a future &s;tate, were no longer known, nor did the race ever think of approving them&s;elves in the eye of an <HI>all per|fect and holy being.</HI> Super&s;tition and iniquity prevailed, and the &s;pread of evil was wide.</P>
<P>God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth&mdash;the thoughts of his heart, evil continually, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as you have before quoted from the book of <HI>Gene&s;is;</HI> and be|cau&s;e the wickedne&s;s of the <HI>tenth generation</HI> was &s;o great, and men no longer endeavoured after tho&s;e perfections, which are natural and proper to rational minds;&mdash;no longer thought of conforming them&s;elves to the di|vine nature, or &s;trove to imitate the excel|lencies of it, tho' con&s;tituted to <HI>give glory</HI> to their <HI>Maker,</HI> and endued with a <HI>rea&s;on and under&s;tanding &s;ufficient</HI> to teach them the <HI>rule</HI> of <HI>duty,</HI> and guide their &s;teps in the ways of true religion; but again&s;t the light of their own minds, acted the mo&s;t impious and un|&s;ociable part; therefore God repented that he had made them, that is, he did what is the product of repentance in men, when they un|do, as far as it is in their power, what they repent of, and de&s;troyed his own work by that de&s;olating judgment, the <HI>flood.</HI> This &s;eems to be the truth of the ca&s;e. The words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> do not mean the <HI>&s;tate of hu|man
<PB N="141" REF="156">nature</HI> on account of the <HI>fall.</HI> They expre&s;s only the <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>tenth gene|ration</HI> as a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for the <HI>deluge</HI> at that time. There is not the lea&s;t ground for a&s;&s;erting from this pa&s;&s;age in the &s;acred hi&s;torian, that man was unable to do good by his natural powers, and that his crimes were a re&s;i&s;ting the act|ings of God upon his mind. The impiety of this generation was a mere abu&s;e of free will, and acting again&s;t the plain dictates of their own minds: therefore, when wilful op|pre&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;uality filled the earth, God de&s;troyed the world by an inundation. <HI>Noah</HI> only, who was a ju&s;t man, and perfect in his generation, with his family e&s;caped.</P>
<P>This terrible execution of an awful ven|geance on the guilty race, demon&s;trated to the &s;urvivors, and to all the ages to come, the great malignity of &s;in, and the uncontrolable &s;upremacy of the divine government. As the venerable Patriarch and his family failed over the bo&s;om of the boundle&s;s ocean of waters, and above the wrecks and ruins of this ter|re&s;trial world, they adored to be &s;ure with grateful hearts, the Almighty Father of vir|tue and goodne&s;s, who had &s;o wonderfully pre&s;erved them, and were convinced by the amazing, &s;triking evidence, that &s;in is the greate&s;t infamy and degradation of our rea|&s;onable nature; that it has an in&s;uperable re|pugnancy and irrever&s;ible contrariety, to our
<PB N="142" REF="157">true happine&s;s, and is infamous, pernicious, and ruinous, by the &s;entence of the Almighty. The dreadful event unan&s;werably evinced his con&s;tant actual cognizance of enormous faith and manners, and his unchangeable di&s;plea|&s;ure with them. This truth, which was learnt at fir&s;t, by the expul&s;ion from <HI>Para|di&s;e,</HI> and the &s;ad inheritance of <HI>Mortality,</HI> they &s;aw again republi&s;hed in the mo&s;t awful manner. This gave undoubtedly a very reli|gious turn to their minds, and they deter|mined to be &s;ure to adhere to tho&s;e excellent principles and practices, which had been, thro' God's goodne&s;s, their &s;ecurity in the ge|neral de&s;olation, and to flee the contrary ma|lignant ones which had procured that de&s;ola|tion on the re&s;t. In a degree &s;uitable to their nature and ability, they re&s;olved to imitate the perfections of God, and to employ the powers and faculties of rea&s;on in endeavour|ing to be ju&s;t, and righteous, and merciful. And as the amazing operation of God in the deluge called for their wonder and prai&s;e, we mu&s;t think their hearts glowed with the &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s to them, and that they ex|tolled his mercy and power in the &s;alvation they had received. So we are told by an in|&s;pired writer. <HI>Noah</HI> re&s;tored the antient rites of divine &s;ervice, and built an altar to the Lord. <HI>And the Lord &s;melled a &s;weet Savour, and &s;aid, Never any more will I cur&s;e the
<PB N="143" REF="158">ground for man's &s;ake, tho' the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;</HI> becau&s;e he will not hearken to the voice of rea&s;on, and with the greate&s;t ardor and contention of mind, labour to attain a conformity to the divine nature in the moral perfections of it; which is the true dignity of man, and the utmo&s;t excellence of human &s;ouls. <HI>Neither will I again &s;mite any more every living creature as I have done. While the earth remaineth, &s;eed|time and harve&s;t, and cold and heat, and &s;ummer and winter, and day and night &s;hall not cea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did God enter into a covenant with <HI>Noah,</HI> and his &s;ons, and their &s;eed; and as the late amazing occurrences mu&s;t incline the &s;pectators of the <HI>flood</HI> to piety and goodne&s;s; and the fathers of the po&s;tdiluvian world were careful to in&s;truct their children in the &s;everal parts of the &s;tupendous fact, and from the whole inculcate the Being and Perfections of God, his univer&s;al dominion and actual pro|vidence and government over all things, his love of virtue and goodne&s;s and infinite de|te&s;tation of all &s;in; to which we may add, that the imitation of God is not a new prin|ciple introduced into religion by revelation, but has its foundation in the rea&s;on and na|ture of things;&mdash;we may from hence conclude, that the ri&s;ing generation were per|&s;ons of con&s;picuous devotion, and followed
<PB N="144" REF="159">after the moral virtues, the holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and mercy which the light of nature di&s;co|vers. They were, I believe, mo&s;t excellent mortals for &s;ome time. They <HI>obeyed</HI> to be &s;ure <HI>every dictate</HI> of rea&s;on, and <HI>adored</HI> and <HI>prai&s;ed</HI> the <HI>invi&s;ible Deity;</HI> the <HI>Supreme im|mutable mind.</HI></P>
<P>But this beautiful &s;cene had an end, and man once more forgot his Maker and him|&s;elf. He pro&s;tituted the honor of both, by robbing God of the obedience due to him, and by &s;ubmitting him&s;elf a &s;lave to the ele|ments of the world. When he looked up to the heavens, and &s;aw the glory of the &s;un and &s;tars, in&s;tead of prai&s;ing the Lord of all, he fooli&s;hly &s;aid, The&s;e are thy Gods, O Man! A univer&s;al apo&s;tacy from the primi|tive religion prevailed. They began with the <HI>heavenly bodies,</HI> or <HI>&s;ydereal Gods,</HI> and pro|ceeded to <HI>heroes, brutes,</HI> and <HI>images,</HI> till the world was overflowed with an inundation of <HI>idolatry,</HI> and <HI>&s;uper&s;tition;</HI> even &s;uch <HI>&s;uper&s;ti|tion,</HI> as nouri&s;hed under the notion of <HI>Reli|gion,</HI> and plea&s;ing the Gods, the mo&s;t <HI>be&s;tial</HI> impurities, the mo&s;t inhuman and unnatural <HI>cruelties,</HI> and the mo&s;t unmanly and contemp|tible <HI>follies.</HI> Moral virtue and goodne&s;s were totally extingui&s;hed. When men had lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme Being, the <HI>Creator, Go|vernor,</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> of the world, they not only cea&s;ed to be righteous and holy, but became
<PB N="145" REF="160">nece&s;&s;arily vitious and corrupt in practice; for iniquity flows from corrupt religion, as the waters from the &s;pring.

<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> explanes this pa&s;&s;age of the Prophet. <Q>Every woman at Babylon, &s;ays the Hi&s;torian, was obliged, once in her life, to &s;it down openly in the temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> in order to pro&s;titute her &s;elf to &s;ome &s;tranger: They enter into the temple, and &s;it down crowned with garlands, &s;ome continually going out, and others coming in: The galleries where they &s;it are built in a &s;trait line, and open on every &s;ide, that all &s;trangers may have a free pa&s;&s;age to chu&s;e &s;uch women as they like be&s;t. Tho&s;e women who excel in beauty and &s;hape are &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but the deformed are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;itated to wait three or four years, before they can &s;atisfy the law. The men declared their choice by throwing money into the lap of the woman they mo&s;t admired, which &s;he was by no means to refu&s;e, but in&s;tantly retire with the man that acco&s;ted her, and fulfil the law. Wo|men of rank (for none were di&s;pen&s;ed with) might &s;it in covered chariots for the purpo&s;e, whil&s;t their &s;ervants waited at a di&s;tance till they had done. <BIBL>Herodot. l. 1. c. 196.198. and 199.</BIBL></Q></P>

<PB N="153" REF="168">judgment and condemnation; yet the father of the univer&s;e, in compa&s;&s;ion to mankind, &s;ent a divine teacher from heaven, <HI>Chri&s;t, the true Prophet that was to come into the world,</HI> and by his divinely reveled te&s;timony and authority, attempts to aboli&s;h the &s;uper&s;tition of men, reclaim their wickedne&s;s, and bring them back to the true &s;piritual wor&s;hip of God, and to that holine&s;s of life and manners which is agreeable to the uncorrupted light and dictates of nature.

Reve|lation thus explained is beautiful and u&s;eful to an extreme degree. It does not contra|dict, but &s;trengthens the obligations of natu|ral religion.</P>
<P>Your account, Sir, (Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> an&s;wered) of man and religion is different indeed from mine, and I mu&s;t allow your explications have rea&s;on in them: but &s;till they do not &s;atisfy me, nor can I part with my own opinion. Two things in particular to me appear very &s;trange in your &s;cheme. It &s;eems to take away the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the chri&s;|tain revelation, if natural religion, duly at|tended to, was perfect, and &s;ufficient for vir|tue and holine&s;s, and thereby to gain the favor of God. If rea&s;on alone can do the work, if men plea&s;e, then what need of the go&s;pel?&mdash;If men will con&s;ider, (and without con&s;ideration no &s;cheme can be of &s;ervice), they may as well turn their thoughts to the law of nature as to the law of grace, if there is no difference betwixt the rule of nature and the law of Chri&s;t, with regard to the know|ledge of God, the maker of heaven and earth, and the wor&s;hip due to him on that ac|count, and the practice of virtue and mora|lity.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="170">In the next place, if I under&s;tand you right, the grace of God is of no u&s;e at all in religion, as you account for &s;alvation. What is out of order within us, in the mind and its faculties, the will and its affections, and wants to be &s;et right in good thoughts and works, our own rea&s;on, in your notion of religion, is &s;ufficient to regulate, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the illumination of the holy &s;pirit of God, we may live in an uncorrupted &s;tate of piety and morality, and &s;o &s;ave our &s;ouls, if we plea&s;e. This is what I cannot believe. The grace of God in the go&s;pel is the glory and comfort of the chri&s;tian religion. A divine operation that renews and &s;anctifies the mind is an in|valuable ble&s;&s;ing, and in a manner inexpre&s;|&s;ibly charming, &s;atisfies me beyond he&s;itation, that the chri&s;tian religion is true, while it puts me in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good effects of it. The &s;pirit of God di&s;covers to me the &s;tate of my own mind, in all the circum&s;tances of a chri&s;tian life, &s;ets my follies, my neglects, and my failings, in order before me, which is the fir&s;t right &s;tep in or|der to the overcoming them; and then ob&s;er|ving the di&s;coveries I was not able to make my &s;elf, and having a &s;trong faith in the di|vine power and &s;ufficiency, I am enabled to gain victories my in&s;ufficient rea&s;on could ne|ver obtain. May this divine monitor then abide in my brea&s;t. It is by the heavenly a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="156" REF="171">of the holy &s;pirit only, as vouch&s;afed in the chri&s;tian di&s;penation, that I can &s;ecure for my&s;elf eternal life. The wi&s;e and prudent of this world may think as they plea&s;e of this matter, and produce rea&s;onings again&s;t it be|yond my power to an&s;wer; but for my part, I mu&s;t con&s;ider it as the <HI>principle</HI> of my <HI>&s;al|vation,</HI> and think I cannot be thankful e|nough for the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. It is to me a glorious in&s;tance of the great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>Madam, (I replyed) in relation to your fir&s;t objection, that I make no difference be|tween reveled and natural religion, for nature is as &s;ufficient as grace, in my account, I a&s;|&s;ure you that I think the revelation of the go&s;pel excels the be&s;t &s;cheme of natural reli|gion that could be propo&s;ed; in declaring the terms of reconcilement, in demon&s;trating the divine wrath again&s;t &s;in, in the method of &s;hewing mercy by the death of God's beloved Son, and the promi&s;e of free pardon on the condition of repentance and newne&s;s of life. This manner gives un&s;peakable comfort to repenting &s;inners. It gives the greate&s;t encou|ragement to engage them to the love of God and the practice of all his commandments; an encouragement that rea&s;on could not di&s;cover. To chri&s;tianity therefore the true preference is due. Tho' philo&s;ophy or the doctrine of rea&s;on may reform men, yet the chri&s;tian re|ligion
<PB N="157" REF="172">is a clearer and more powerful guide. It improves the light of rea&s;on by the &s;uper|natural evidence and declaration of God's will, and the means of man's redemption is a more efficacious motive and obligation to univer&s;al obedience than nature could ever with certainty propo&s;e. A revelation that has the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t evidence of being the divine will, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t ea&s;y and effectual method of in&s;truction, and be more noticed than the be&s;t human teaching: and this will of God being truly and faithfully committed to writing, and pre&s;erved uncor|rupt, mu&s;t always be the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t rule of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>manners.</HI> It is a rule ab&s;olutely free from all tho&s;e errors and &s;uper&s;titions, both of belief and practice, which no hu|man compo&s;ure was ever before free from, or, probably, would have been free from, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a revelation. Nor is this all. This is not the only &s;upe|rior excellence of our holy religion.</P>
<P>A Mediator and crucified Redeemer brought into the Chri&s;tian revelation, has a noble effect on a con&s;idering mind, and &s;hews the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation. The wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t rational heathens ever were for &s;acrifices and mediators, as the greatne&s;s of God was thereby declared, and that not only &s;in de&s;erved puni&s;hment, but mens lives to be forfeited by their breach of
<PB N="158" REF="173">the divine laws: and when a divine per&s;on, <HI>made man, like unto us,</HI> appears in&s;tead of all other mediators, <HI>by whom,</HI> as the in&s;trument of the means of &s;alvation, we are to offer up our prayers to the Only true God; and his voluntary dying in te&s;timony of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion and doctrine, is appointed to be in&s;tead of all other &s;acrifices, and to re|main a memorial that God requires no atone|ment of us, but <HI>repentance and newne&s;s of life;</HI> and the &s;potle&s;s virtues and obedience of this divine Redeemer, are to be a mo&s;t perfect and moving example for us to imi|tate;&mdash;this renders chri&s;tianity worthy of God, and makes it the perfection of religion. <HI>Great</HI> then are the <HI>advantages</HI> which the <HI>Re|velation</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> has <HI>above mere rea&s;on,</HI> darkened by the clouds of error and a gene|ral corruption. It is the mo&s;t perfect rule of life. It is the mo&s;t powerful means to promote a con&s;tant uniform practice of vir|tue and piety.

<P>With regard to the &s;econd objection, that I take away the grace of God, to pre|&s;erve the dignity of human nature, this is far from my intention. I do in|deed think, that as the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> was given for

<HEAD>28. My depar|ture from <HI>La&s;co</HI> in Stanemore, a farther de&s;cription of this wild and &s;olitary part of the world.</HEAD>
<P>The 13th of June 1725, I took my leave of my friend, <HI>John Price,</HI> and his ad|mirable wife, promi&s;ing to vi&s;it them again as
<PB N="164" REF="179">&s;oon as it was in my power,  and proceeded on my journey in que&s;t of Mr. <HI>Turner.</HI> I would not let <HI>Price</HI> go with me, on &s;econd thoughts, as many &s;ad accidents might happen in this rough and de&s;olate part of the world, and no relief in &s;uch ca&s;e to be found. If I fell, there was no one belonging to me to &s;hed a tear for me: but if a mi&s;chief &s;hould befall <HI>Jack Price,</HI> his wife would be mi&s;erable indeed, and I the maker of a breach in the &s;weete&s;t &s;y&s;tem of felicity that love and good &s;en&s;e had ever formed. This made me refu&s;e his re|peated offers to accompany me. All I would have was a boy and hor&s;e of his, to carry &s;ome provi&s;ions wet and dry, as there was no public hou&s;e to be found in a&s;cending tho&s;e tremendous hills, or in the deep vales through which I mu&s;t go; nor any hou&s;e that he knew of beyond his own.</P>
<P>With the ri&s;ing &s;un then I &s;et out, and was charmed for &s;everal hours with the air and views. The mountains, the rocky precipices, the woods and the waters, appear|ed in various &s;triking &s;ituations every mile I travelled on, and formed the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing points of view. Sometimes I was above the clouds, and then crept to inchanting vallies below. Here glins were &s;een that looked as if the mountains had been rent a&s;under to form the amazing &s;cenes: and there, fore&s;ts and falling &s;treams covered the &s;ides of the hills. Rivers in many places, in the mo&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="180">beautiful ca&s;cades, were tumbling along; and cataracts from the tops of mountains came roaring down. The whole was grand, won|derful, and fine. On the top of one of the mountains I pa&s;&s;ed over at noon; the air was piercing cold, on account of its great height, and &s;o &s;ubtle, that we breathed with difficulty, and were a little &s;ick. From hence I &s;aw &s;everal black &s;ubjacent clouds big with thunder, and the lightning within them rolled backwards and forwards, like &s;hining bodies of the brighte&s;t lu&s;tre. One of them went off in the grande&s;t horrors through the vale below, and had no more to do with the pike I was on than if it had been a &s;ummit in another planet. The &s;cene was prodigious fine. <HI>Sub pedibus ventos &amp; rauca tonitrua calcat.</HI></P>
<P>Till the evening, I rid and walked it, and in numberle&s;s windings round unpa&s;&s;able hills, and by the &s;ides of rivers it was im|po&s;&s;ible to cro&s;s, journeyed a great many miles: but no human creature, or any kind of hou&s;e, did I meet with in all the long way, and as I arrived at la&s;t at a beautiful lake, who&s;e banks the hand of nature had adorned with va&s;t old trees, I &s;at down by this water in the &s;hade to dine, on a neat's tongue I had got from good Mrs. <HI>Price;</HI> and was &s;o de|lighted with the &s;triking beauties and &s;tillne&s;s of the place, that I determined to pa&s;s the night in this &s;weet retreat. Nor was it one
<PB N="166" REF="181">night only, if I had my will, that I would have re&s;ted there. Often did I wi&s;h for a convenient little lodge by this &s;weet water &s;ide, and that with the numerous &s;wans, and other fowl that lived there, I might have &s;pent my time in peace below, till I was re|moved to the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eat of happine&s;s a|bove.</P>

But be it town or country, the main bu&s;ine&s;s, my good readers, &s;hould be to &s;ecure an inheritance in that eternal world, where the &s;anctified live with God and his Chri&s;t. <HI>Getting, keeping, multiplying money; dre&s;s, plea&s;ure, entry;</HI> are not only <HI>little things</HI> for &s;uch beings as we are: they are indeed &s;ad <HI>principal</HI> work for creatures that are <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away</HI> to an everla&s;ting &s;tate; there to lament their lo&s;t day, and talents mi&s;applied, in dread|ful agonies, in the habitations of darkne&s;s; &mdash;or, to remain for ever in the habitations of light, peace, and joy; if you have laboured to <HI>obtain,</HI> and improve in the graces and vir|tuous qualities which the go&s;pel recommends.

<P> The lake I have mentioned was the large&s;t I had &s;een in this wild part, being above a mile in length, and more than half a mile broad; and the water that filled it, bur&s;t with the greate&s;t impetuo&s;ity from the in&s;ide of a rocky mountain, that is very wonderful to behold. It is a va&s;t craggy precipice, that a&s;cends till it is almo&s;t out of &s;ight, and by its gloomy and tremendous air, &s;trikes the mind with a horror that has &s;ome|thing plea&s;ing in it. This amazing cliff &s;tands perpendicular at one end of the lake, at the di&s;tance of a few yards, and has an opening at the bottom, that is wide enough for two coaches to enter at once, if the place was dry. In the middle of it, there is a deep channel, down which the water ru&s;hes with a mighty &s;wiftne&s;s and force, and on either &s;ide, the &s;tone ri&s;es a yard above the impetuous &s;tream. The a&s;cent is ea&s;y, flat and plane. How far it goes, I know not, being afraid to a&s;cend more than forty yards; not only on account of the terrors common to the place, from the fall of &s;o much water with a &s;trange kind of roar, and the height of the arch which covers the torrent all the way; but becau&s;e as I went up, there was of a &s;udden, an encrea&s;e of noi&s;e &s;o very ter|rible, that my heart failed me, and a trem|bling

It was well I did; for I had not been many minutes out, before the water overflowed its channel, and filled the whole opening in ru&s;hing to the lake.

<PB N="170" REF="185">of water, by the divine appointment: and therefore, I imagine it is from thence the water of this mountain proceeds, and the great overflowing and terrifying &s;ound at cer|tain times. To this <HI>motion</HI> of the <HI>aby&s;s,</HI> by the divine power exerted on it, I a&s;cribe the <HI>earthquakes;</HI> and not to <HI>vapor,</HI> or <HI>electricity.</HI> As to electricity, which Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> makes the cau&s;e of the deplorable downfall of <HI>Li&s;|bon</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nov. 1. 1755.</NOTE>, in his book lately publi&s;hed, (called, The Philo&s;ophy of Earthquakes), there are many things to be objected again&s;t its being the origin of &s;uch calamities:&mdash;one objection is, and it is an in&s;uperable one, that electri|cal &s;hocks are ever momentary, by every ex|periment, but earthquakes are felt for &s;everal minutes. Another is, that many towns have been &s;wallowed up in earthquakes, tho' <HI>Li&s;|bon</HI> was only overthrown. Such was the ca&s;e of the city of <HI>Callao,</HI> within two leagues of <HI>Lima.</HI> Tho' <HI>Lima</HI> was only tumbled into ruins, October 28, 1746; yet <HI>Callao</HI> &s;unk downright, with all its inhabitants, and an unfathomable &s;ea now covers the fine&s;t port in <HI>Peru,</HI> as I have &s;een on the &s;pot.&mdash; In the earthquake at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> June 7, 1692, in which &s;everal thou&s;ands peri&s;hed, it is certain, that not only many hou&s;es, and a great number of people, were intirely &s;wal|lowed up; but that, at many of the gapings or openings of the earth, torrents of water that formed great rivers, i&s;&s;ued forth. This
<PB N="171" REF="186">I had from a man of veracity then on the &s;pot, who was an eye-witne&s;s of the&s;e things, and expected him&s;elf every minute to de&s;cend to the bowels of the earth, which heaved and &s;welled like a rolling &s;ea. Now to me the electrical &s;troke does not appear &s;ufficient to produce the&s;e things. The power of electricity, to be &s;ure is va&s;t and amazing. It may cau&s;e great tremors and undulations of the earth, and bring down all the build|ings of a great city: but as to &s;plitting the earth to great depths, and forcing up tor|rents of water, where there was no &s;ign of the fluid element before, I que&s;tion much if the vehemence of the elemental electric fire does this.&mdash;Be&s;ide, when mountains and cities &s;ink into the earth, and the deepe&s;t lakes are now &s;een to fill all the place where they once &s;tood, as has been the ca&s;e in many countries, where could the&s;e mighty waters come, but from the <HI>aby&s;s?</HI>&mdash;The great lake <HI>Oroquantur</HI> in <HI>Pegu,</HI> was once a va&s;t city. In <HI>Jamaica,</HI> there is a large deep lake where once a mountain &s;tood.&mdash;In an earthquake in <HI>China,</HI> in the province of <HI>Sanci,</HI> deluges of water bur&s;t out of the earth, Feb. 7, 1556, and inundated the country for 180 miles. Many more in&s;tances of this kind I might produce, exclu&s;ive of <HI>Sodom,</HI> the ground of which was inundated by an irruption of waters from beneath, (which now forms the <HI>dead &s;ea)</HI> after the
<PB N="172" REF="187">city was de&s;troyed by fire from above; that the land which had been defiled with the unnatural lu&s;ts of the inhabitants might be no more inhabited, but remain a la&s;ting mo|nument of the divine vengeance on &s;uch crimes, to the end of the world: and the u&s;e I would make of tho&s;e I have mentioned, is to &s;hew, that the&s;e mighty waters were from the furious concu&s;&s;ion of the aby&s;s that cau&s;ed the earthquakes. Electricity, I think, can never make &s;eas and va&s;t lakes to be where there were none before. <HI>Locherne,</HI> in the county of Fermanagh, in the province of <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is thirty three miles long, and fourteen broad, and as the old Iri&s;h chronicle informs us, was once a place where large and populous towns appeared, till for the great iniquity of the inhabitants, the people and their fair habitations were de|&s;troyed in an earthquake, and mighty waters from the earth covered the place, and formed this lake. Could the <HI>electrical &s;troke</HI> produce this &s;ea that was not to be found there before the de&s;truction? Is it not more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch va&s;t waters have been forced by a &s;upernatural commotion from the great aby&s;s, in the earthquake that de&s;troyed the towns which once &s;tood in this place?</P>
<P>To this then, (till I am better informed), I mu&s;t a&s;cribe &s;uch earthquakes as produce great rivers and lakes: and where no waters appear, I believe the earthquakes are cau&s;ed
<PB N="173" REF="188">by the immediate finger of God; either operating on the aby&s;s, tho' not &s;o as to make the water break out on the earth; or by di|recting the electrical violence or &s;troke; or otherwi&s;e acting on the ruined cities and &s;hattered places.</P>

<P>Various are the accounts that learned men have given of mu&s;cular motion, and ingenious are their rea&s;onings on the &s;ubject: but they are not &s;atisfactory, nor do they at all explain the thing, and account for it. What is a mu&s;cle?</P>
<P>It is to be &s;ure a bundle of &s;mall blood ve&s;&s;els, con&s;i&s;ting of arteries and their return|ing veins, laid one upon another in their pa|rallel plates, running thro' the whole length of the mu&s;cle; and at &s;mall intervals, the&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="196">blood ve&s;&s;els, or longitudinal, red, and fle&s;hy fibres, are contorted and bound about with &s;mall, tran&s;ver&s;e, and &s;piral ramifications and twinings of the nerves. This is a mu&s;cle: it has two ends, or tendons, fa&s;tened to two bones, one of which is fixed, and the other moveable; and by the contraction of the mu&s;cle, the moveable bone is drawn upon its <HI>fulcrum</HI> towards a fixed point. This is in|di&s;putable; and it is likewi&s;e certain, that the mu&s;cles are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in|to tho&s;e of voluntary, and tho&s;e of natural or nece&s;&s;ary motion: that the voluntary mu&s;cles have antagoni&s;ts, which act alter|nately in a contrary direction, that is, are contracted by the command of the will, while the others are &s;tretched, and again are extended, while the others are contracted: but the nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;cles have contracting and extending powers within them&s;elves, and need no antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>This being the true &s;tate of the mu&s;cles, the que&s;tion is, what cau&s;es that ela&s;ticity, &s;pring, or power of contraction and re&s;to|ration, which their nervous coats and fibres have, to recover them&s;elves again&s;t a given weight or force that &s;tretches them? The reply is, that many unan&s;werable rea&s;ons can be given to prove, that this contractive re&s;ti|tutive force does not depend on the mixture, efferve&s;cence, or rarefaction of any fluids,
<PB N="182" REF="197">humours, or liquors within the body; and there is one convincing experiment that &s;hews it.</P>
<P>Lay open the thorax of a dog, (as I have often done) and take a di&s;tinct view of that famous mu&s;cle, the heart, in its curious and wonderful motion, while the animal is &s;till alive. In <HI>dia&s;tole,</HI> the <HI>mu&s;cle</HI> is <HI>very red</HI> and <HI>florid, &s;oft</HI> and <HI>yielding</HI> to the touch, and thro' it the vital fluid glows and &s;hines; it appears in this &s;tate fully repleni&s;hed and di&s;tended with blood: but in <HI>&s;y&s;tole,</HI> as &s;oon as it begins to contract, and the blood ru&s;hes out by the compre&s;&s;ion of the contracting fibres, the <HI>heart lo&s;es its florid colour,</HI> and be|comes <HI>pale</HI> and <HI>livid, compact</HI> and <HI>&s;olid,</HI> and evinces that, during this &s;tate of it, the mu&s;|cle contracts inwardly into its own den&s;e &s;ub|&s;tance, and takes up le&s;s &s;pace than before, till it returns to its <HI>dia&s;tole:</HI> then the blood which flowed from it with velocity, during <HI>&s;y&s;tole</HI> thro' the <HI>coronary veins</HI> into the <HI>auri|cles,</HI> ru&s;hes back into it thro' the <HI>coronary ar|teries,</HI> re&s;tores the glowing florid colour, and inflates the mu&s;cle, in order to &s;train the nerves for the next contraction. It is plain from hence, that the heart has le&s;s blood and fluid in time of <HI>contraction,</HI> and that the <HI>con|traction</HI> is not cau&s;ed by the addition of ano|ther fluid from the nerves, as the learned have a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="198">And as to what they &s;ay of the longitudi|nal fibres being divided into innumerable lit|tle cells or bladders, which have communi|cations with the blood ve&s;&s;els and nerves, and that in the&s;e ve&s;icles, the blood and nervous fluid mix, ferment, and by rarefaction and expan&s;ion, &s;well and blow up the cells, and thereby inflate and di&s;tend the mu&s;cle, and increa&s;e its thickne&s;s, while its length is &s;hortned:&mdash;this is &s;o perplexed and un|rea&s;onable an hypothe&s;is, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed how men of &s;en&s;e ever came to think of &s;uch a doctrine. There is no &s;uch nervous fluid to be found, to cau&s;e this fermentation, rarefaction, etc; and if there was, expan&s;ive force mu&s;t lengthen as well as thicken, and the mu&s;cle could not be &s;hortned in length, and &s;welled in thickne&s;s. The natural ac|tion of the fluids upon the &s;olids is, to in|crea&s;e dimen&s;ions proportionably every way, that is, in the direction of the axis and con|jugate diameter equally. Be&s;ide, if there was <HI>expan&s;ion, circulation</HI> mu&s;t &s;top. The di&s;tention of the ve&s;icles, and the rapid exit of the rarifying fluid could not be at once.</P>
<P>The plain account of the matter is then, that <HI>mu&s;cular motion is performed by the ela&s;|ticity of the nervous fibrillae, contracting and re&s;toring them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;tretching force of the circulating blood.</HI> The <HI>contraction</HI> of the mu&s;cle &s;traitens and compre&s;&s;es the blood|ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="184" REF="199">and forces the blood with impetuo&s;ity thro' the heart; and this &s;queezing or pro|pelling force gives the fluid an impetus, that makes it return with violence upon the mu&s;|cle, in the cour&s;e of its circulation; then by force and impul&s;e, it &s;tretches the tran&s;ver&s;e and &s;piral nervous fibres, and &s;o extends the contracted mu&s;cle, that drove it by contrac|tion from it&s;elf. Upon this, the blood|ve&s;&s;els having obtained their due extent and capacity, the di&s;tending force of the blood of con&s;equence cea&s;es: but the moment it does, the contractive power of the nerves begins to act again, and re&s;tores them to a contracted den&s;e &s;tate, by a force exactly equal to that which extended them; till the returning propelled blood re-enters the mu&s;|cle, and &s;tretches it again, as before de&s;cribed. Such are the two wonderful counter-forces that produce the natural involuntary motion of the heart, and carry on the circulation of the blood. You &s;ee with your eyes, in the opened live dog, this <HI>alternate contraction and exten&s;ion;</HI> and as the <HI>&s;tretching</HI> power is but a con&s;equence of the <HI>contracting</HI> power, <HI>contraction</HI> is the <HI>&s;pring</HI> of this <HI>wonderful ac|tion,</HI> in which our will or free agency has no concern. And to what &s;hall we a&s;cribe this a&s;toni&s;hing operation, this amazing <HI>contrac|tive power,</HI> &s;o exactly as to time, and &s;o con|&s;tantly continued on the mu&s;cles of natural

<P>And if we turn our eyes from the mu&s;|cles of mere natural involuntary motion, (which performs by a contracting power, acting within them), to tho&s;e mu&s;cles which move the bones and members of our bodies, by the command of the will, how adorable is the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Almighty Author of nature, not only in providing the animal machine with <HI>antagoni&s;tical mu&s;cles,</HI> one of which is contracted, while the other is extended; but for &s;timulating, con|tracting, and compre&s;&s;ing the nervous ela&s;tic cords and blood-ve&s;&s;els, as our minds com|mand or determine! there is no po&s;&s;ibility of accounting for the directions at plea&s;ure of the antagoni&s;tic mu&s;cles, but by re&s;olving them into the <HI>continual pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>action</HI> of the fir&s;t cau&s;e.

<P>The conclu&s;ion of the matter is, that the plain argument for the exi&s;tence of a Deity, obvious to all, and carrying irre&s;i&s;tible con|viction with it, is from the evident contri|vance and fitne&s;s of things to one another, which we meet with through all the parts of the univer&s;e. There is no need of nice and &s;ubtile rea&s;oning in this matter: a manife&s;t contrivance immediately &s;ugge&s;ts a contriver. It &s;trikes like a &s;en&s;ation, and artful rea&s;on|ings again&s;t it may puzzle us, but it is with|out &s;haking our belief. No per&s;on, for ex|ample, who knows the principles of opticks, and the &s;truture of the eye, can believe that it is formed without &s;kill in that &s;cience; or that the ear was formed without the knowledge of &s;ounds.&mdash;This is a ju&s;t argument, and forces our a&s;&s;ent. But the
<PB N="189" REF="204">great <HI>Maclaurin</HI> &s;hould not have &s;topped here. The plain argument for the exi&s;tence of a Deity grows &s;tronger, when we add to it what is as evident as divine contrivance, to wit, the <HI>con&s;tant interpo&s;ition of God,</HI> to &s;up|port and move his creatures. Original con|trivance in the works of the creation is adora|ble. We are certain, demon&s;tratively cer|tain, that the heavens, the land, and the waters, and all the creatures in them con|tained, are the works of the living God: but it is the pre&s;ent performance that <HI>&s;trikes us like a &s;en&s;ation.</HI> With inexpre&s;&s;ible plea|&s;ure we &s;ee creating power with our eyes. Which ever way we turn them, we behold Almighty Power employed, and continually acting under the direction of infinite know|ledge.</P>
<P>Since things are &s;o, and all the works of nature, in the common voice of rea&s;on, de|clare the power and wi&s;dom of the Creator, and &s;peak his goodne&s;s in the innumerable mighty things he continually performs for our pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s, the contempla|tion of them &s;hould warm our hearts with the Glory of the Almighty, and make us continually prai&s;e and adore that Almighty providence, which formed and &s;u&s;tains not only the human race and this terre&s;trial globe, but numberle&s;s other worlds and their inha|bitants, that hang in infinite &s;pace.

<HEAD>36. Remarks on the de|luge.</HEAD>
<P> Many books have been written in re|lation to this affair, and while &s;ome contend for the overflowing of the whole earth to a very great height of waters&mdash;and &s;ome for a partial deluge only&mdash;others will not allow there was any at all. The divine au|thority of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> they di&s;regard. For my part, I believe the <HI>flood</HI> was <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and that all the high hills and mountains under the whole heaven, were covered. The cau&s;e was forty days heavy rain, and &s;uch an agi|tation of the aby&s;s, by the finger of God, as not only broke up the great deep, to pour out water at many places, but forced it out of &s;uch bottomle&s;s lochs as this I am &s;peak|ing of on the mountains top, and from va|rious <HI>&s;wallows</HI> in many places. This removes every objection from the ca&s;e of the deluge, and gives water enough in the &s;pace of 150 days, or five months of 30 days each, to over-top the highe&s;t mountains by 15 cubits, the height de&s;igned. The aby&s;s in &s;trong commotion, or violent uproar, by a power divine, could &s;hake the incumbent globe to pieces in a few minutes, and bury the whole ruins in the deep. To me, then, all the rea&s;oning again&s;t the deluge, or for a partial flood, appear &s;ad &s;tuff. Were this one loch in Stanemore to pour out torrents of water, down every &s;ide, for five months, by a di|vine force on part of the aby&s;s, as it might very ea&s;ily by &s;uch means do, the inundation
<PB N="194" REF="209">would cover a great part of this land; and if from every loch of the kind on the &s;ummits of mountains, the waters in like manner, with the greate&s;t violence, flowed from every &s;ide out of the aby&s;s, and that exclu&s;ive of the heavy rains, an earthquake &s;hould open &s;ome parts of the ground to let more water out of the great collection, and the &s;eas and oceans &s;urpa&s;s their natural bounds, by the winds forcing them over the earth, then would a univer&s;al flood very &s;oon prevail. There is water enough for the purpo&s;e, and as to the <HI>&s;upernatural a&s;cent of them, natural</HI> and <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> are nothing at all different with re&s;pect to God. They are di&s;tinctions merely in our conceptions of things. Regu|larly to move the &s;un or earth; and to &s;top its motion for a day;&mdash;to make the waters that covered the whole earth at the creation, de&s;cend into the &s;everal receptacles prepared for them; and at the deluge, to make them a&s;cend again to cover the whole earth, are the effect of one and the &s;ame Almighty Power; tho' we call one <HI>natural,</HI> and the other <HI>&s;upernatural.</HI> The one is the effect of no greater power than the other.

<PB N="199" REF="214">was broad and deep, and on an ea&s;y de&s;cent to it, was an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;tones, that ran in length about 100 feet, in breadth 30 feet, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling the <HI>giant's cau&s;eway,</HI> in the county of Antrim, and province of Ul&s;ter in Ireland; nine miles north ea&s;t from the pretty town of <HI>Colerain.</HI> The <HI>giants cau&s;eway,</HI> reader, is a prodigious pile of rocks, 80 feet broad, 20 feet above the re&s;t of the &s;trand, and that run from the bottom of a high hill above 200 yards into the ocean.</P>

It ri&s;es with great noi&s;e and vibration, and gu&s;hes out with a force &s;ufficient to turn many mills. The water is clear and cold, but to the ta&s;te unplea&s;ant, being &s;omething like a bad egg. I judged from the nature of its motion, that the water would take fire, and having lit my torch, &s;oon put it in a flame. The fire was fierce, and the water ran down the vale in a blaze. It was a river of fire for a con&s;iderable way, till it &s;unk under ground among &s;ome rocks, and thereby di&s;appeared. After it had burnt &s;ome time, I took &s;ome boughs from a tree, and tying them together, beat the &s;urface of the well for a few minutes, and the burning cea&s;ed. The water was not hot, as one might ex|pect, but cold as the colde&s;t &s;pring could be. There are a great number of &s;uch &s;prings in
<PB N="203" REF="218">the world, but this is the large&s;t I have read of, or &s;een. It differs from that of <HI>Bro&s;eley</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> within &s;ix miles of <HI>Bridge-north,</HI> in this re&s;pect, that <HI>Bro&s;eley</HI> well will not continue to burn for any time, unle&s;s the air be kept from it; to which purpo&s;e they have enclo&s;ed it in an iron ci&s;tern with a cover to it; and to experiment the boiling a piece of meat by the fire of this &s;pring, they clap the pot clo&s;e down when they cover is taken up, and then it burns as long as they will; mak|ing the large&s;t joint of meat fit to eat in half the time the &s;tronge&s;t culinary fire could do the work. As to the medicinal virtues of the &s;pring, in the mountains, I can only &s;ay, that as it has a copious &s;ulphur, and from thence flames like &s;pirit of wine, it is probable it might be as effectual in commu|nicating &s;anity in various ca&s;es, as the fa|mous burning &s;pring is in the palatinate of of <HI>Cracow</HI> of the le&s;&s;er <HI>Poland,</HI> mention'd in the <HI>Leip&s;ic acts,</HI> An. 1684. p. 326. And as to the extingui&s;hing this fire by beating it with twigs, it mu&s;t to be &s;ure be for the rea&s;on given by Mr. <HI>Denis,</HI> that as the inflam|mability of &s;uch &s;prings is to be a&s;cribed to &s;ulphur, and to its exhalations bur&s;ting out of the water; &s;o this floating flame, which is too &s;ubtle to heat the water, is &s;tifled, by in|volving the&s;e &s;pirits in the aqueous particles, by bru&s;hing the &s;urface with brooms.</P>
<P><HI>Conradus</HI> tells us, concerning the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="219">&s;pring, that at one time, when it was kindled by lightning, the people neglected to put it out, and the &s;tream proceeded on fire for al|mo&s;t three years, and reduced all the neigh|bouring wood to a&s;hes. It is really a won|derful &s;ight to &s;ee &s;uch a river of fire, and adorable mu&s;t be that power, who has cau&s;ed &s;uch things. To &s;ay that matter and motion circum&s;cribe and regulate &s;uch powers, is idle to the la&s;t degree. It is an inver&s;ion of rea&s;on. The very exi&s;tence of the water and &s;ulphur of this &s;pring, mu&s;t be by the power of the Creator con&s;tantly put forth upon it, which cau&s;es the parts to be what we call &s;uch things; and the motion of both mu&s;t be an <HI>im|pre&s;&s;ion;</HI> for motion is not e&s;&s;ential to matter. Nothing el&s;e could produce them, and a cau&s;e there mu&s;t be equal to the various and wonderful effects of both, a cau&s;e that is in|finite, wi&s;e, and powerful. The Deity is every where pre&s;ent, and every where active. His power is inde&s;inently working, gives ex|i&s;tence to the various creatures, and produces the mo&s;t noble phaenomena in nature. All we &s;ee, all we feel, fire and water, the uni|ver&s;al variety of inanimate and animate crea|tures, are only the effects of his creating power con&s;tantly repeated. The exi&s;tence of the whole world is a continual new crea|tion; and therefore it becomes the bounden duty of all rational creatures, to wor&s;hip this Almighty Power, as well for his works of
<PB N="205" REF="220">creation, as for the ways of his <HI>providence.</HI> Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty: and ju&s;t and righteous are thy ways, O King of &s;aints: who would not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name, becau&s;e thou only art <HI>holy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>39. Another loch on the top of a high moun|tain, and a &s;wallow in the bottom.</HEAD>
<P> From the burning fountain we pro|ceeded for half an hour in the &s;ame valley right onwards, and then turned to the left in a cour&s;e to the we&s;t, for about a mile, which brought us to the bottom of a &s;teep moun|tain, we mu&s;t a&s;cend, or go no farther. It was hard to get the hor&s;es over this, and no le&s;s difficult to de&s;cend with them to a deep bottom on the other &s;ide of the hill: but with great hazard to our&s;elves and the bea&s;ts, we came down in &s;afety. On the top of this mountain I &s;aw another large <HI>loch</HI> that was black as ink in appearance, tho' bright when taken up in a gla&s;s; which, (as before ob&s;erved) mu&s;t be owing I &s;uppo&s;e to its top communicating with the <HI>aby&s;s</HI> below; and in the bottom we de&s;cended to, there was a <HI>&s;wallow</HI> larger than the one I &s;aw before. I could make no di&s;covery as to its depth, either by line or &s;ound; nor did my lead touch any water. On the &s;loping way from the fir&s;t cha&s;m in day to the gulph, were &s;everal lateral chambers, that de&s;cended one yard in &s;ix; but tho' the bottom was hard, the horrors of the places hindered me from going far. I went to the
<PB N="206" REF="221">end of the fir&s;t, which was 67 yards, and having looked into the &s;econd, to which a narrow &s;hort pa&s;s leads the inquirer, I made what ha&s;te I could back; for the opening di&s;covers a &s;pace &s;o va&s;t, di&s;mal, and frightful, that it &s;trikes one to the heart. The bottom, as far as my light could enable me to di&s;tin|gui&s;h, was a continuance of &s;tone; but neither top nor &s;ides were to be &s;een. It is a horrible place.</P>

<HEAD>40. An amaz|ing arch thro' a mountain in a de|lightful &s;pot of ground.</HEAD>
<P> Leaving this bottom, we mounted ano|ther very high and dangerous hill, and from the top of it de&s;cended into twenty acres of as rich and beautiful ground as my eyes had ever &s;een. It was covered with flowers and aromatic herbs; and had, in the center of it, a little grove of beautiful trees; a|mong which were fruits of &s;everal kinds. A flowing &s;pring of the pure&s;t water was in the middle of this &s;weet little wood, and ran in pretty windings over the ground. It re|fre&s;hed and adorned the field, and it was beautiful to &s;ee the deer from the hills, and the goats come down from the cliffs, to drink at the&s;e &s;treams. The whole was &s;urrounded with precipices that a&s;cended above the clouds, and through one of the&s;e rocky mountains there was an opening that had a &s;tupendous appearance.</P>
<P>It was a va&s;t amazing arch, that had &s;ome re&s;emblance of the gothic i&s;le of a large cathedral church, and terminated in a view
<PB N="207" REF="222">of rocks hanging over rocks in a manner frightful to behold. It mea&s;ured an hun|dred yards in length, 40 in breadth, and I judged it to be fifty yards high. The pending rocks in view inclo&s;ed a &s;pace of four acres, as it appeared to me, and the bottom was &s;o very deep that it looked like night below. What line I had could not reach it, nor could I make any thing of the depth by &s;ound. It &s;eemed to me to be a va&s;t <HI>&s;wallow</HI> that went down to the <HI>aby&s;s.</HI> The whole was a &s;cene that har|rowed the &s;oul with horror.</P>

<HEAD>41. An extra|ordinary pa&s;&s;age thro' the mountains.</HEAD>
<P> By the &s;pring in the little grove I have mentioned, I &s;at down at 8 in the morning, to breakfa&s;t on &s;omething that one of my &s;quires produced from his &s;tore, while the other was looking for a pa&s;&s;age or way on|wards, between tho&s;e va&s;t precipices that &s;ur|rounded us. Two hours he wa&s;ted in an enquiry, and then returned, to let me know there was no pa&s;&s;age that he could find: the enclo&s;ed rocks were one continued chain of unpa&s;&s;able mountains. Here then I thought was my ne plus ultra. As the man af|firmed there was no getting beyond the va&s;t inclo&s;ing cliffs that walled in this charming &s;pot of earth, I imagined for &s;ome time, that I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity re|turn, and give over all thoughts of getting to the borders of <HI>Cumberland</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hop|rick</HI> that way. It &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="208" REF="223">proceed, and that was no &s;mall trouble to my mind. It was a great journey round, and if I did ride it, I knew not where to turn in on the confines of the country my friend lived on; for I had lo&s;t his directions, and had only a &s;mall remembrance of his dwelling &s;omewhere on the north edge of We&s;tmoreland or York&s;hire, or on the ad|joining borders of Cumberland, or the county of Durham. What to do I could not for &s;ome time tell: going back I did not at all like, and therefore, to avoid it if po&s;&s;ible, re&s;olved to pa&s;s the day in trying if I could find any way out, with|out climbing the mountain again that I had lately come down. Round then I walked, once, and to no manner of purpo&s;e, for I did not &s;ee any kind of pa&s;s; but the &s;econd time, as I marched on ob&s;erving the hill, I took notice of a large clump of great trees in an angle or deep corner, that &s;eemed to &s;tand very oddly, and in the mountain above them there appeared as I thought a di&s;tance or &s;pace that looked like an opening. I &s;oon found it was &s;o, and that at the back of this little wood, there lay a very narrow way, only broad enough for two hor&s;es a-brea&s;t: that it extended due we&s;t for more than a mile, and then we&s;t-north-we&s;t for a quarter of a mile, till it terminated in a plain that was &s;everal miles in circumference, and in|tirely &s;urrounded with hills. This I di&s;co|vered
<PB N="209" REF="224">in walking the pa&s;s by my&s;elf, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1725.</NOTE> and then returned to bring the hor&s;es and men, through this amazing way. It was quite dark, mere night all along; and the bottom very bad. It was likewi&s;e every dangerous. It was evident from the ground, that &s;tones had fallen from the tops of the hills; and &s;hould any de&s;cend from &s;o va&s;t a height on us, tho' even &s;mall ones, they would without all peradventure be immediate death.</P>

<HEAD>42. A reflexion on the com|pletion of every wi&s;h the moment it is formed.</HEAD>
<P> The plain we came into from the de|file, was above a mile over to the oppo&s;ite hills, and a-cro&s;s it was a walk of aged oaks, that &s;eemed, in &s;uch a place, as the avenue that leads to the <HI>fairy ca&s;tle of wi&s;hes.</HI> If &s;uch beings there are, as Dr. <HI>Fowler,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> hath in one of his books af|firmed, then here, I &s;aid, in this fine ro|mantic region, where all the charms of the field, the fore&s;t, the water, and the moun|tains, are united, may be their favorite man|&s;ion, and perhaps they will admit me into their <HI>fairy ca&s;tle:</HI> then commences their friend&s;hip, and when they have all breathed on me, it is but wi&s;hing for the future, and the completion of every de&s;ire is granted the moment it is formed. Would not this be compleat happine&s;s? what do you &s;ay, re|flexion?</P>
<P>No, (reflexion an&s;wered, as we rid up this avenue.) Imagination may form fine pictures
<PB N="210" REF="225">of felicity from an indulgence in every wi&s;h; but, &s;o blind are mankind to their own real happine&s;s, that it is oftner to the gratification than to the di&s;appointment of their wi&s;hes that all their mi&s;ery is owing. We often choo&s;e what is not con&s;onant to the welfare of our nature, and &s;trive to avoid tho&s;e inci|dents which are fated in the order of incon|trolable events for our good. Frequently do we labour to &s;ecure the things that deba&s;e us into &s;laves, and overwhelm us with cala|mity; but &s;eldom do we de&s;ire, rarely do we &s;trive to obtain tho&s;e objects, and acquire that &s;tation, which are mo&s;t likely to render humanity as perfect as it can be in this world, rational and godlike, and thereby crown our lives with true happine&s;s. Many a man has pur&s;ued a Venus, an e&s;tate, an honour, with much toil and wonderful activity, and when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fancyed ble&s;&s;ing, have been made very mi&s;erable mortals. The wi&s;hed for beauty has often made even the hu&s;band wretched. An aching &s;car is often covered with the laurel: and in re&s;pect of envied great fortunes, gaudy is the thing without, and within very often is mere bitterne&s;s. The wi&s;dom is, as to this world, not to get from the fairies a power of enjoying all that fancy may de&s;ire, if that was po&s;&s;ible; but, to act well and wi&s;ely, in the mo&s;t rea|&s;onable, lovely, and fair manner, and pro|po&s;e

This (continued <HI>reflexion),</HI> in re&s;pect of this life, were there no other, is preferable to the <HI>ca&s;tle of wi&s;hes,</HI> if we could find it at the end of this avenue 

<NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot"><P>In the 2d volume of Familiar Letters between the characters in David Simple, the reader will find an excellent &s;tory in relation to <HI>wi&s;hing,</HI> which the ingeni|ous female writer calls a fragment of a Fairy Tale. p. 225&mdash;275: and concludes it in the following &s;en&s;ible manner.&mdash;The good <HI>Fairy</HI> came often to vi&s;it me, and confirmed me in my re&s;olution, never again to be &s;o un|rea&s;onable, as to de&s;ire to have all my wi&s;hes compleated; for &s;he convinced me, that the &s;hort-&s;ighted eyes of mortals were not formed to &s;ee, whether the event of any of their own wi&s;hes would produce mo&s;t happine&s;s or mi&s;ery: and that our greate&s;t felicity, often ari&s;es from the very di&s;appointment of tho&s;e de&s;ires, the gratifica|tion of which, at the fir&s;t view, &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to our welfare.</P></NOTE>


.</P>
<P>But if another life is taken into the que|&s;tion, the argument grows &s;tronger again&s;t a power of enjoying all we could wi&s;h for.&mdash; As we are accountable creatures, and are pouring fa&s;t out of time into eternity, reli|gion undoubtedly ought to be the main bu&s;i|ne&s;s of mortals;&mdash;that religion, which is a living principle, &s;pring, or root of ac|tions
<PB N="212" REF="227">in the &s;oul; wrought there by the hand of him that made us; and which requireth us to honour and fear God as the &s;upreme Lord, to e&s;teem him as the chief good; and to exerci&s;e and expre&s;s that honour, that fear, and that e&s;teem, by all the means, and in all the ways, which rea&s;on and revelation ap|point for &s;uch exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion; that we may gain the love of the Almighty, and obtain the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eat of happine&s;s above: but &s;uch force hath the objects of &s;en&s;e upon the mind, that it is more than probable they would outweigh the di&s;tant hopes of religion, if wi&s;hing could bring in even a tenth part of what the vanity of man, and his &s;en&s;es would call for. It would be &s;o far from be|ing an advantage to mankind, if they could wi&s;h and have va&s;t fortunes, all the plea&s;ures, the pomps and honours of the world, that they would thereby be deprived of the ra|tional joys of life, and be influenced to think no more of the excellency and beauty of re|ligion, and the good con&s;equences of &s;erving God truly.

<P>Thus did <HI>reflexion</HI> entertain me, as I rid up this grand &s;hady walk, which looked like the avenue I had read of in the <HI>Tales</HI> of the <HI>Fairies,</HI> and brought me to a <HI>natural grotto,</HI> more beautiful than <HI>Aelian</HI>'s de&s;crip|tion of <HI>Atalanta's,</HI> or that in <HI>Homer,</HI> where <HI>Calyp&s;os</HI> lived. &mdash; It was a large cavern at the bottom of a marble mountain, and with|out, was covered round with ivy, that clung about &s;ome aged oaks, (on either &s;ide the en|trance) that &s;eemed coeval with the earth on which they grew. Abundance of large lau|rel trees, in clumps, adorned an exten&s;ive area before the door; and &s;affron, and hya|cinths, and flowers of many colours, covered in confu&s;ed &s;pots the carpet green. The beau|tiful ground refre&s;hed the &s;ight, and purified the air: and to enhance the beauties of the &s;pot, a clear and cold &s;tream gu&s;hed from a neighbouring rock; which watered the trees and plants, and &s;eemed to combat with the earth, whether of them mo&s;t contributed to their growth and pre&s;ervation. It was a

<P>The in&s;ide of this <HI>grotto</HI> was a beautiful green marble, extremely bright, and even ap|proaching to the appearance of the emerald.

The whole had a fine effect, and as the cave had been divided by art into &s;ix fine apart|ments, and had doors and chimnies mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly contrived, both the man&s;ion and its &s;ituation charmed me in a high degree. It was a beautiful habitation indeed. On ei|ther &s;ide of it were many cottages, pretty and clean, and as &s;heep were feeding on the field, &s;ome cows grazing, and various kinds of tame fowl before the doors, I concluded it was an inhabited place, before I &s;aw any one.</P>

Her hair was brown, bright and charming; and nature had &s;tamped upon her cheeks a colour, that exceeded the mo&s;t beautiful red of the fine&s;t flower. It was continually as the maiden blu&s;h of a mode&s;t innocence. She was dre&s;t in a fine woollen &s;tuff, made in the manner &s;hepherde&s;&s;es are painted, and on her head had a band or fillet like what the ladies now wear, with a bunch of artificial flowers in her hair.

<P>By this time, we reached the grotto door, and upon entring the fir&s;t apartment, I &s;aw another lady, dre&s;t in the &s;ame manner, and &s;eemed to be of the &s;ame age, that is, about &s;ix and twenty, as I was told. This was <HI>Azora</HI>'s companion and friend. She was a very pretty woman, tho' inferior to <HI>Azora</HI> in charms: but her mind was equally luminous and good. Neither &s;he nor <HI>Azora</HI> were learned women, that is, they under&s;tood no other language than the Engli&s;h tongue, and in that they had but a &s;mall collection of the be&s;t books; but tho&s;e few they had read
<PB N="219" REF="234">well, and they had capacities to think. In rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy, and mathematicks, they were excellent, and in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, di&s;covered in conver&s;ation the fine&s;t conceptions of the mo&s;t excellent things. <HI>Azora,</HI> of the two, was by much the be&s;t &s;peaker. Her voice was delightful, and her pronunciation ju&s;t; &s;trong, clear, and vari|ous. With un&s;peakable plea&s;ure did I li&s;ten to her, during three days that I happily pa&s;&s;ed with her and her companion, and received from both many valuable informations. I thought I under&s;tood algebra very well, but I was their inferior, and they in&s;tructed me; and on the fundamental points of religion, they not only out-talked me, but out-rea&s;oned me. It is very &s;trange, I confe&s;s. It is very true, however.</P>
<P><HI>Azora,</HI> in particular, had an amazing col|lection of the mo&s;t rational philo&s;ophical ideas, and &s;he delivered them in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing dre&s;s, with as much ea&s;e as &s;he breathed. She a&s;ked me, after I had fea&s;ted on an excellent &s;upper, how religion went on in the world; and what was the condition of that which came from &s;upernatural com|munication, as &s;he phra&s;ed it? and when I told her, that our excellent divines did all that was po&s;&s;ible for men to do, to turn the world from <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> of every kind to that

<P>What can be more unju&s;t and impious, <HI>(Azora</HI> continued) than for men to declame again&s;t a revelation which di&s;plays the pater|nal regard of God for his creatures, by doing more than was &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary for their hap|pine&s;s, as they had his <HI>original law</HI> of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> before he gave them the <HI>go&s;pel;</HI> and which en|ables us to extend our knowledge even as to tho&s;e things which we are by nature capable of knowing; which awakens us to duty, and advi&s;es us how to walk in the ways of pru|dence and &s;afety. To reject &s;uch an extra|ordinary method of &s;aving us, is &s;en&s;ele&s;s and culpable indeed.

The oppo&s;ition, in my opinion, is without ex|cu&s;e; as the external evidence of hi&s;tory, miracles, and prophecy for the go&s;pel, is in|conte&s;tably &s;trong, when fairly examined; mu&s;t appear with force to a mode&s;t, candid, impartial inquirer; and as the internal evi|dence for the &s;acred letters, their u&s;efulne&s;s and excellence, mu&s;t be obvious to every attentive capacity, that delights in the pur&s;uit of religion and virtue.

Her ideas of activity and pa&s;&s;ivity afforded me much in&s;truction, as did her notions of &s;pace, matter, and &s;pi|rit: and what is &s;till more extraordinary, &s;he had a fine conception of an <HI>electrical fluid,</HI> which is thought to be a di&s;covery made very lately, and made u&s;e of it to prove, not that it is the ultimate cau&s;e of effects, but that every thing is cau&s;ed and directed by an <HI>immaterial &s;pirit.</HI> An <HI>imma|terial &s;pirit</HI> was her favorite article, and it was to me a fine entertainment to hear her on that &s;ubject; from the one &s;upreme Spirit down to the &s;pirit of brute animals. &mdash; But to conclude our conver&s;ation on religion; I ob|&s;erved to <HI>Azora,</HI> that if things were &s;o, and the law of rea&s;on was &s;o perfect and &s;ufficient, then I could not &s;ee that there was any want at all of the <HI>religion of favor,</HI> &s;ince that of <HI>nature</HI> was enough to confirm us in rectitude and holine&s;s, if we would obey its directions; and to &s;hew us the way to the <HI>man&s;ions</HI> of <HI>angels.</HI> Why the <HI>law of grace</HI> at &s;o great an expence &mdash; if the <HI>rule of rea&s;on</HI> can make us good here, and for ever happy hereafter?</P>

<P>The &s;um of the whole is, the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI>  that word of truth and power, enters the hearts, and breaks the power of &s;in in the &s;oul.

<P>All this (I an&s;wered) is ju&s;t and fine,  and I have only to reque&s;t, for my farther in|&s;truction, that you will be plea&s;ed, madam, to explain your&s;elf a little more on the ar|ticles of a <HI>&s;in-offering</HI> and <HI>grace;</HI> for I have always thought there was a darkne&s;s &s;at upon the&s;e parts of reveled religion, and have often wi&s;hed for what I have not yet found, a head capable of giving me intire &s;atisfaction on tho&s;e points: but from what I have heard you &s;ay, I mu&s;t now &s;uppo&s;e that all my doubts, relative to the two &s;ubjects, you have the power to remove. &mdash; My power <HI>(A|zora</HI> returned) is no more than a plain un|der&s;tanding, that in this &s;till and peaceful re|gion, has been at liberty to think, without being corrupted by &s;ophi&s;try, &s;chool-non&s;en&s;e, or authority; and, as to giving &s;atisfaction on the heads you mention, or any other, it is not what I pretend to: but my opinion you &s;hall have &s;ince you a&s;k it; and in the following manner <HI>Azora</HI> proceeded.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Azora's ac|count of Chri&s;t be|ing a &s;in-offering.</HEAD>
<P>As to our <HI>Lord</HI>'s becoming a <HI>&s;in-offering,</HI> I conceive, in the fir&s;t place, that God or|dained
<PB N="236" REF="251">it, becau&s;e he &s;aw it <HI>needful,</HI> and <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary</HI> to an&s;wer <HI>many and great ends.</HI> It mu&s;t be right, and what in the rea&s;on and nature of things ought to be, though we were not able to comprehend the rea&s;ons that made it needful. It mu&s;t have been the pro|pere&s;t way to make up the breach between heaven and earth, &s;ince infinite wi&s;dom ap|pointed it.</P>
<P>In the next place, as the <HI>death of this great per&s;on</HI> not only gave the highe&s;t atte&s;tation to the truth of his doctrine, and confirmed every word he had preached; to the encourage|ment of &s;inners to repent, and the great con|&s;olation of &s;aints; but has afforded us &s;uch a noble <HI>pattern</HI> of <HI>obedience,</HI> as mu&s;t have an influence on intelligent beings, and excite them to <HI>practi&s;e obedience</HI> to all the com|mands of God, and perfect re&s;ignation to his will in every ca&s;e; which are &s;ome excellent rea&s;ons for Chri&s;t's dying; &s;o did Almighty God make this farther u&s;e of it, that he ap|pointed the <HI>blood of Chri&s;t</HI> (which was &s;hed to produce the <HI>e&s;&s;ence of &s;anctification</HI> in the &s;oul, to wit, <HI>devotedne&s;s, tru&s;t,</HI> and <HI>re|&s;ignation</HI> to the Almighty Father of the uni|ver&s;e; to be the <HI>blood of anew covenant, &s;hed for many for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> This &s;eems to me to take in the whole ca&s;e. Chri&s;t by <HI>obe|dience to the death</HI> (which happened in the natural cour&s;e of things) is held out to the
<PB N="237" REF="252">world a <HI>pattern</HI> of <HI>&s;elf-&s;acrifice</HI> in the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> &mdash; a <HI>&s;ample</HI> of that <HI>perfect religion &mdash; not my will, but thine be done:</HI> the glorious go&s;pel is thereby confirmed: and our <HI>redemption</HI> is effected by the <HI>blood of the Son of God.</HI> As <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> repeated to the people the laws and judgments of God, and received their con&s;ent to the divine commands; en|tered this covenant in his book, offered &s;a|crifices of prai&s;e and friend&s;hip, and then confirmed the covenant in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, by dividing the blood of the &s;acri|fices into parts; one part of which he <HI>&s;prink|led on the altar,</HI> to ratify God's part of the covenant: and with the other part <HI>&s;prinkled the people,</HI> that is, the twelve princes, the heads, or the twelve pillars, which repre|&s;ented the twelve tribes, and then awfully cried out with a &s;trong voice &mdash; <HI>Behold the blood of the covenant Jehovah has made with you:</HI> &s;o did the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Me|diator</HI> between God and all mankind, teach the people by his <HI>go&s;pel</HI> to <HI>rectify their notions,</HI> to <HI>regulate their affections,</HI> to <HI>direct their wor&s;hip;</HI> with the judgments that were to be the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience, the rewards prepared for tho&s;e who obey; and then de|clared, in relation to his death, <HI>This is my blood of the new covenant.</HI> The <HI>blood</HI> I mu&s;t &s;hed on the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> will &s;eal, ratify, and con|firm
<PB N="238" REF="253">a pardoning covenant, and by virtue thereof, upon repentance and conver&s;ion, the world <HI>is wa&s;hed clean through the blood of the Lamb.</HI> This, I think for my&s;elf, renders the thing very plain and ea&s;y. The death of the Son of God was taken into the plan of redemption, <HI>not to pacify God's anger;</HI> for God could be no otherwi&s;e plea&s;ed or delight|ed with the <HI>blood of his Son,</HI> than as his &s;hed|ding it was an act of the highe&s;t obedience, and a noble pattern to all the rational crea|tion; but <HI>his blood</HI> was made the <HI>&s;eal</HI> of a <HI>pardoning</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tifying covenant;</HI> and by the <HI>death of Chri&s;t,</HI> (the mo&s;t powerful means to prevent &s;in, and to draw &s;inners to obey the commands of heaven,) God de|mon&s;trated his love and mercy to mankind. I fancy I am clear. In this view of the mat|ter, I can &s;ee no difficulty in being ju&s;tified <HI>freely by the grace of God, thro' the redemp|tion which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> God is the &s;ole original and fountain of redemption. The <HI>Son,</HI> and his <HI>go&s;pel</HI> are the great in&s;tru|ments. <HI>Lo! I come to do thy will, O my God,</HI> the Son declares: and the <HI>Blood</HI> he <HI>&s;hed,</HI> the better to bring the human race to wi&s;dom, rectitude and happine&s;s, is appointed by our merciful, good, and gracious Father, to be the &s;eal and ratifcation of a new cove|nant. <HI>Moloch</HI> might want a cruel and bloody &s;acrifice to pacify him; but the <HI>Father</HI> of
<PB N="239" REF="254">the univer&s;e &s;ent his <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to <HI>deliver</HI> his <HI>commands,</HI> and made the death, which he fore&s;aw would happen by his Son's delivering &s;uch commands to impious men, to be a co|venant between <HI>Jehovah</HI> and the <HI>people,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould be con&s;idered as <HI>a propitiation for our &s;ins,</HI> and his <HI>death</HI> be an <HI>eternal me|morial</HI> of the Almighty's love, and abhor|rence of iniquity. There can no objection lie again&s;t this. To me this appears the mo&s;t rational and beautiful &s;cheme that infinite wi&s;dom could contrive. Mo&s;t glorious and good is our God. Mo&s;t happy may mortals be, if they plea&s;e. The virtuous obedience of our Lord hath obtained from God a right and power to aboli&s;h death. His <HI>blood</HI> hath confirmed the covenant of grace, and his go&s;pel hath brought life immortal into light.</P>

<HEAD>Azora's account of grace.</HEAD>
<P>As to the <HI>influence</HI> of the <HI>&s;pirit, (Azora</HI> continued) that there is &s;uch a <HI>living prin|ciple</HI> in the human &s;oul, cannot I think be denied, if revelation is to be believed; but the mode of influencing is not perhaps to be explained otherwi&s;e than by &s;aying, that our gracious and good Father makes now and then &s;ome friendly impre&s;&s;ions upon our minds, and by repre&s;enting in &s;everal lights the terrors and promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, ex|cites our hopes and fears. As I apprehend, we can go very little further. It is ea&s;y I think to prove from the &s;criptures, that as
<PB N="240" REF="255">the extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary for planting <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> at fir&s;t; &s;o is a &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t, tho' not in &s;o illu&s;trious a manner, &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to per|form the conditions of the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI> Tho' God has recalled the more vi&s;ible &s;igns of his pre|&s;ence, yet to be &s;ure he continues to influence &s;ome way or other. I cannot &s;uppo&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t has wholly withdrawn him&s;elf from the church. The <HI>renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> (St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays) was <HI>a promi&s;e made to them and to their children, and to tho&s;e that were afar off, even as many as God &s;hould call;</HI> and as human nature has the &s;ame weakne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ions, and extravagancies of former ages, there is as much need of a divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance now as in the time of the apo&s;tles: nay more need, I think, at pre&s;ent, as miracles are cea&s;ed. There mu&s;t be a weight of &s;uperna|tural power to pre&s;s within, as there are now no fla&s;hings from the &s;ky, or extraordinary appearances without, to prove the certainty of our religion, and make us con&s;ider its promi&s;es, threatenings, and rules: but the way this &s;upernatural principle acts, as before ob&s;erved, is hard to determine, any more than what I have &s;aid, and in&s;tead of wa&s;t|ing our time in enquiries how the thing is done, our bu&s;ine&s;s is to render our&s;elves ca|pable of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, by not grieving
<PB N="241" REF="256">this holy &s;pirit, le&s;t he depart from us; and re&s;olving with the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>to walk with a perfect heart, and to &s;et no wicked thing be|fore our eyes.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;trive to improve religious thoughts: we mu&s;t labour hard to obey the written rules: God will then give us the <HI>grace &s;ufficient for us.</HI> To our con|&s;iderable talent of natural power to do good, our Father will add the advantages of his his &s;pirit. If we de&s;ire to be good, he will make us good in conjunction with our own application and pains; by a gradual proce&s;s, and human methods. If <HI>nature</HI> gives her <HI>utmo&s;t actings,</HI> the <HI>author</HI> of <HI>nature</HI> will move, and direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t her where &s;he is weak. Both the grace and the providence of God may be likened to a little &s;pring concealed within a great machine: to the known given powers of the machine, the operations of it are a&s;cribed, and all its events imputed; yet it is the &s;mall &s;ecreted &s;pring that directs, draws, checks, and gives move|ment to every weight and wheel. The ca&s;e cannot be exactly alike, as a compound of matter and &s;pirit is different from a machine: but it may &s;ugge&s;t I imagine &s;ome imperfect idea of the affair: a very imperfect one, I confe&s;s, for if we were thinking ever &s;o long of the matter, <HI>grace</HI> after all would be what the apo&s;tle calls it, an <HI>un&s;peakable gift</HI> &mdash; A gift &s;urmounting our apprehen&s;ions as well as
<PB N="242" REF="257">it does our merit. The theory of it may be perhaps too excellent for us, and our part is, not to determine how, but with hone&s;t hearts to pray, that a ray from heaven may open, and &s;hine upon our under&s;tanding, clear it from prejudices and impo&s;tures, and render it teachable, con&s;iderative and firm; may in&s;pire good thoughts, excite good pur|po&s;es, and &s;ugge&s;t whole&s;ome coun&s;els and expedients. This the divine power may ea&s;ily do, without depriving us of free|will, or le&s;&s;ening our own moral agency. That power may extingui&s;h an imagination we &s;trive to get rid of: may remove an im|pediment we labour to be freed from: may foil a temptation we do our be&s;t to re&s;i&s;t. If we do all we can, and implore the divine aid, there is no doubt but the Almighty may give his free creatures &s;uch powers and di&s;po&s;itions, as will carry them innocently and &s;afely thro' the trial of this fir&s;t &s;tate. On &s;uch conditions, God, the Father of &s;pirits, the friend of men, the patron of righteou&s;ne&s;s and all virtue, will, without all peradven|ture, di&s;tribute his grace to every mortal in proportion to the mea&s;ures of nece&s;&s;ary duty.</P>

<HEAD>A reflec|tion on A|zora's di&s;|cour&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>Here <HI>Azora</HI> ended,  and I &s;at for &s;ome mi|nutes after in great admiration. Her fancy furni&s;hed ideas &s;o very fa&s;t, and &s;peaking was &s;o very ea&s;y to her, without one pang in
<PB N="243" REF="258">the delivery, or the lea&s;t he&s;itation for hours, as &s;he could, if &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;o long di&s;cour&s;e; her judgment was &s;o &s;trong, and her words &s;o proper and well placed, that &s;he appeared to me a prodigy in &s;peaking, and I could have li&s;tened to her with delight and amaze|ment the whole night. But exactly at ten o'clock, the old woman I mentioned before, who fir&s;t bid me welcome to <HI>Burcot Lodge,</HI> came into the chamber with candles, and <HI>Azora</HI> told me, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gladu&s;e, the old wo|man, con|ducts me to a bed in her cottage.</NOTE> that if I would follow <HI>Gla|du&s;e,</HI> &s;he would light me to bed. I did im|mediately, after wi&s;hing the ladies good night, and my guide brought me to her own cottage, which was next door to the grotto. She &s;hewed me into a &s;mall clean room, neatly and prettily furni&s;hed, and there I found a good bed. Down I lay as &s;oon as I could, being much fatigued, and as the &s;un was ri&s;ing, got up again, to write what I could remember to have heard <HI>Azora</HI> &s;ay. My memory from my childhood has been very extraordinary. I believe there are few living exceed me in this re&s;pect. The great|e&s;t part of what I read and hear, remains with me, as if the book was &s;till before me, or the &s;peaker going on. This enables me to write down, with much exactne&s;s, what I care to note, and I can do it for the mo&s;t part in the relater's or talker's own words, if I minute it in my &s;hort hand within twenty|four

The digging and laborious work was per|formed by many young women, who did it with great activity and under&s;tanding, and the nicer parts the&s;e ladies executed. I was a&s;toni&s;hed and delighted with their opera|tions of various kinds. It was beautiful to &s;ee with what exqui&s;ite &s;kill they u&s;ed the knife, managed graffs and cyons, directed the branches and twigs in po&s;ture on e&s;pa|liers, and rai&s;ed flowers. They had every thing in perfection in their kitchen garden and phy&s;ic garden. Their fruits, roots, and
<PB N="245" REF="260">herbs for the table, were mo&s;t excellent: their collection of herbs for medicine the mo&s;t valuable: and as the whole contrivance of the gardens was <HI>near nature,</HI> and beauti|ful in <HI>gra&s;s, gravel,</HI> and variety of <HI>ever|greens,</HI> I was led with delight thro' the whole, till I came into the green-hou&s;e.

She told me, among other matters, that there was only <HI>pike</HI> and <HI>perch</HI> in her pond, and that the rea&s;on of it was, becau&s;e &s;he loved <HI>pike</HI> above all fi&s;h, and as the <HI>jacks</HI> were <HI>fi&s;h</HI> of <HI>prey,</HI> no fi&s;h but the <HI>perch</HI> could live with them: The <HI>perch</HI> on account of the thorny fins on its back, e&s;capes the <HI>pike</HI>'s voracious appetite. She farther informed me, that the <HI>jacks</HI> in her <HI>pond</HI> were the fine&s;t in the world, as I would &s;ee at dinner, and that the rea&s;on of it was owing to the high feeding &s;he took care they had every day: be&s;ide the entrails of what fowl and &s;heep her people killed for her ta|ble and them&s;elves, the pike had blood and
<PB N="247" REF="262">bran mixed in plenty, and all the frogs &s;he could get from a neighbouring fen; for of them the <HI>jacks</HI> are mo&s;t fond. This made the fi&s;h extraordinary: and as the water was <HI>current</HI> thro' the pond, and the bottom of <HI>various depths</HI> from one foot, and two feet, to &s;ix feet, that the &s;pawn may have &s;hallow water to lie in, and the fry &s;hallow water to &s;wim in, as they both required, this was the rea&s;on, that one acre of water in &s;uch a man|ner, produced double the quantity of fi&s;h to what a pond of &s;till water, and a bottom all of one depth, could have. See (<HI>Azora</HI> con|tinued) what multitudes there are. They know me, as I feed them my&s;elf every day, and tamely come up, cruel tyrants as they are, to get their meat. Here &s;he called <HI>jack, jack,</HI> and throwing in a ba&s;ket of unfortunate frogs, it was wonderful to &s;ee how tho&s;e de|vouring mon&s;ters appeared, and voraciou&s;ly &s;wallowed the poor things.</P>

<HEAD>Morning prayer.</HEAD>
<P>O Chri&s;t,  our ble&s;&s;ed mediator, pray for us that our faith fail not, and thro' thy me|rits and interce&s;&s;ion, Lord Je&s;us, let our prayer be &s;et forth in the &s;ight of Almighty God as incen&s;e, and the lifting up of our hands as a morning &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Almighty and everla&s;ting God, thou pure and infinite Spirit, who art the great cau&s;e and author of nature, and ha&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the world by thy wi&s;dom, and &s;tretched out the heavens by thy di&s;cretion; upon whom depends the exi&s;tence of all things, and by who&s;e providence we have been pre&s;erved to this moment, and enjoyed many ble&s;&s;ings and unde&s;erved advantages; graciou&s;ly ac|cept, we be&s;eech thee, our grateful &s;en&s;e and acknowledgements of all thy beneficence to|wards us; accept, O Lord, our mo&s;t hearty and unfeigned thanks for all the in&s;tances of thy favor which we have experienced; that we have the u&s;e of our rea&s;on and un|der&s;tanding, in which many fail, and have had refre&s;hing &s;leep and quiet the pa&s;t night; for delivering us from evil, and giving us our
<PB N="249" REF="264">daily bread;&mdash;for all the nece&s;&s;aries, conve|niencies, and comforts, which thy liberal hand ha&s;t provided for us, to &s;weeten human life, and render it more agreeable than other|wi&s;e it could be in this day of our exerci&s;e, probation and trial. While we live, we will prai&s;e and magnify thy awful name, and join in a&s;cribing with the glorious and innumera|ble heavenly ho&s;t, honour, power, and thank&s;giving to the eternal God, who &s;its on the throne of &s;upremacy unrivalled in ma|je&s;ty and power.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially, O great and ble&s;&s;ed God, adored be thy goodne&s;s for &s;o loving the world, as to give thy only begotten Son, to the end, that all who believe in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life; for his humbling him&s;elf even to the death upon the cro&s;s, and &s;hedding his blood for the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins. Great and marvellous are thy works of mercy, O Lord God Almighty! who can utter all thy prai&s;e? Prai&s;e our God, all ye his &s;ervants, and ye that fear him, &s;mall and great. Amen; allelujah. Ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</P>
<P>O God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have mercy on us du&s;t and &s;in, weakne&s;s and imperfection, and enter not into &s;trict judgment with us, thine un|righteous
<PB N="250" REF="265">and unworthy &s;ervants. We con|fe&s;s with &s;hame and grief, that we have vio|lated thine holy laws, and abu&s;ed thy tender mercies: that we have followed too much the devices and de&s;ires of our own hearts, and in numberle&s;s in&s;tances have offended again&s;t a mo&s;t righteous governor, a mo&s;t tender and compa&s;&s;ionate Father, and a mo&s;t kind and bounteous benefactor. In thought, word, and deed, many have been our of|fences: and many are &s;till our imperfections. We have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and before thee, and have thereby de&s;erved thy ju&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure. But our hope and confidence is in thine infinite mercy, O God, and that ac|cording to thy promi&s;es declared unto man|kind in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord, thou wilt &s;pare them who confe&s;s their faults, and re&s;tore them that are penitent. We do ear|ne&s;tly repent, and are heartily &s;orry for all our misdoings. Thro' faith we offer up the Lamb that was &s;lain to the eternal God for the redemption of our &s;ouls; believing the worthine&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, oblation and atonement for the &s;ins of a repenting world, and therefore re&s;olving, with all our &s;trength, to imitate his &s;potle&s;s virtue, and perfect obedience. Pardon us, then, we be&s;eech thee, and blot out our iniquities. Deliver us, we pray, in the name of the
<PB N="251" REF="266">Lord Je&s;us, from the evil con&s;equences of all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and follies, and give us &s;uch powers and di&s;po&s;itions as will carry us innocently and &s;afely thro' all future trials.</P>
<P>Create in us, O God, pure hearts, and re|new right &s;pirits within us. Ca&s;t thy bright beams of light upon our &s;ouls, and irradiate our under&s;tandings with the rays of that wi&s;|dom which &s;itteth on the right hand of thy throne. Let thy holy &s;pirit enable us to act up to the dignity of our rea&s;onable nature, and &s;uitably to the high character, and glo|rious hopes of chri&s;tians: that we may &s;ub|ordinate the affairs and tran&s;actions of time to &s;erve the intere&s;t of our &s;ouls in eternity: that we may &s;hake off this vain world, and breathe after immortality and glory: that we may live in perfect reconciliation with the law of everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth, and goodne&s;s; and &s;o comply with thy nature, mind, and will, O eternal and &s;overeign &s;pi|rit, thou God mo&s;t wonderful in all perfec|tions, that we may fully an&s;wer the relation we &s;tand in to thee. Relieve and ea&s;e our con&s;ciences, O ble&s;&s;ed God, by the blood of &s;prinkling, according to our &s;everal condi|tions of body and mind; and &s;upply us with &s;uitable grace and &s;trength.</P>
<P>We be&s;eech thee, in the next place, Al|mighty Lord, to take us into thy protection this day, and &s;uffer no Being to injure us, no mis|fotune
<PB N="252" REF="267">to befal us, nor us to hurt our&s;elves by any error or mi&s;conduct of our own. Give us, O God, a clear conception of things, and in all dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;tretch forth the right hand of thy Maje&s;ty to help and de|fend us. From &s;ickne&s;s and pain, and from all evil and mi&s;chief, good Lord deliver us this day, and be propitious unto us, we be|&s;eech thee.</P>
<P>And while we remain in this world, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, &s;ecure us from every thing that is terrible and hurtful, and keep us in peace and &s;afety. From all &s;ad accidents and calamitous events, from all tormenting pains and grievous di&s;ea&s;es, good Lord deliver us; and ble&s;s us with &s;o much health and pro&s;perity, as will enable us to pa&s;s our time here in contentment and tranquil|lity.</P>
<P>And when the time of our di&s;&s;olution cometh, by the appointment of thy adorable wi&s;dom, O Father of mercies and the God of all comforts, grant us a decent and happy exit; without di&s;traction of mind or tor|ments of body: let thy &s;ervants depart in peace, and &s;uddenly die in the Lord.</P>
<P>We pray, likewi&s;e, for the happine&s;s of all mankind: that they may all know, and obey, and wor&s;hip thee, O Father, in &s;pirit and in truth, and that all who name the name of Chri&s;t, may depart from iniquity,
<PB N="253" REF="268">and live as becomes his holy go&s;pel. We be|&s;eech thee to help and comfort all who are in danger, nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ickne&s;s, and tribula|tion: that it may plea&s;e thee to &s;anctify their afflictions, and in thy good time to deliver them out of all their di&s;tre&s;&s;es.

<HEAD>A reflection on the reli|gion and piety of the inhabitants of Burcot-Hamlet.</HEAD>
<P>Thus ended the evening and morning of|fices of wor&s;hip at <HI>Burcot-Lodge,</HI>  and as I cannot &s;ufficiently prai&s;e, &s;o I could not enough admire the religion and piety of this congregation. The purity of their wor&s;hip was charming: and in the ladies and their people a devotion was manife&s;t, that looked more like that of heavenly &s;pirits, than of beings in an animal frame; who are warped with the cu&s;toms of the world, and perplexed with difficulties which ari&s;e from &s;en&s;ible objects. They appeared in high admiration of God, endeared to his righteous govern|ment, devoted to his holy laws, and power|fully drawn to imitate him in all his imitable perfections. Not one idle word, or carele&s;s look, did I hear or &s;ee, dur|ing the whole time of divine &s;ervice; but,
<PB N="261" REF="276">like creatures fixed unchangeably in the in|tere&s;t of religion and virtue, and delighted with the joys of piety, their hearts melted in every part of their devotions, and their brea&s;ts were filled with the mo&s;t grateful, tran&s;porting adorations and affections. So much beautiful religion I had not often &s;een in any a&s;&s;embly. They had a true &s;en&s;e in|deed of the love and goodne&s;s of God, and of the grace and charity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They had all been carefully in&s;tructed by a wi&s;e and excellent man, who was not long &s;ince removed from them by death; and his daughter, the admirable <HI>Azora,</HI> in conjunction with his niece, the amiable <HI>Antonia,</HI> took all po&s;&s;ible pains, &s;ince the decea&s;e of Mr. <HI>Burcot,</HI> to maintain the power of religion in their com|munity, and keep the people hearty and &s;teady in the principles and practice of it. This brings me again to the hi&s;tory of <HI>A|zora.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Continua|tion of the hi&s;tory of Azora.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Azora Burcot</HI> was the daughter of a gen|tleman who was one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very great fortune,  but by a fatal pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>grand operation,</HI> and an opinion of the po&s;|&s;ibility of finding the <HI>philo&s;opher's &s;tone,</HI> he wa&s;ted immen&s;e &s;ums in operations to di&s;|cover that <HI>preparation,</HI> which forces the <HI>faeces</HI> of infu&s;ed metals to retire immediately on its approach, and &s;o turns the re&s;t of the ma&s;s into pure gold; communicating the mallea|bility
<PB N="262" REF="277">and great ductility of that metal, and giving it true &s;pecific gravity, that is, to wa|ter, as eighteen and one half is to one. His love of that fine, antient art, called <HI>chi|mi&s;try,</HI> brought him into this misfortune. For improvement and plea&s;ure, he had been long engaged in various experiments, and at la&s;t, an <HI>adept</HI> came to his hou&s;e, who was a man of great &s;kill in the labours and operations of &s;pagyri&s;ts, and per&s;uaded him it was po&s;&s;ible to find the &s;tone; for he, the <HI>adept,</HI> had &s;een it with a <HI>brother,</HI> who had been &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover it, after much labor and operation.

Lully</HI> was a very learned man for the latter end of the 13th century, and writ &s;everal books in Latin; &mdash; <HI>Generales artium libri. &mdash; Libri logi|cales, phile&s;ophici et metaphi&s;ici. &mdash; Variarum artium libri. &mdash; Libri &s;pirituales praedicabiles</HI> &mdash; and the <HI>vade mecum Lulli;</HI> which is a Latin piece on the philo&s;o|phers &s;tone.</P>

gold again. This I have experimented. But the alchy|mi&s;ts &s;ay, gold may be reduced into a gum of &s;ub&s;tance like honey, without any corro&s;ive, and that gum &s;teeped in &s;pirit of wine acquires a ruby colour.

<P>Chymi&s;try, reader, is a fine and antient art. The analy&s;ing of &s;en&s;ible bodies by fire, to di&s;cover their real powers and virtues, is highly prai&s;e-worthy, and the &s;urpri&s;ing ex|periments we make, fill the mind of an in|quirer after truth, with the greate&s;t venera|tion for the wonderful author of nature: but more than this is a &s;ad romance that ends in empty pockets.

<P>When Mr. <HI>Burcot</HI> found he had almo&s;t ruined him&s;elf, and that he was no longer able to live as he had done, he laid his me|lancholy ca&s;e before his daughter <HI>Azora,</HI> and a&s;ked her advice, What he &s;hould do? To retire immediately, <HI>(Azora</HI> &s;aid) to this part of <HI>Stanemore,</HI> which was an unvalued part of his e&s;tate, and bring as many of his te|nants as he could per&s;uade to inhabit this fine tract of land: &mdash; to &s;ell what remained of his fortune, and with the money procure as many of the nece&s;&s;aries or comforts of liv|ing as could be had: to get in particular &s;ome young trade&s;men and their wives by offered rewards in this place; to build cottages for the people; and render the fine caverns in the rock as habitable and plea&s;ing for them|&s;elves as art could render them. Here, <HI>(A|zora</HI> told her father) we &s;hall live more hap|py than we could do, if &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune to make an appearance in the world. We &s;hall enjoy by indu&s;try and prudence every good thing that rational life can re|quire, and live &s;ecured from the &s;trokes of fortune, and the world's contempt. Stran|gers to vanity and the plea&s;ures of high life, in this delightful retreat, we &s;hall pa&s;s our hap|py
<PB N="267" REF="282">days as in a region of goodne&s;s, know|ledge, and joy; and the predominant bent of our hearts will be to wi&s;dom, and virtue, and to a&s;cend into the realms of perfect day. &mdash; Happy advice, (the father of <HI>Azora</HI> &s;aid), and the thing was immediately done. A colony was quickly e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and every thing was &s;ettled and ordered in the mo&s;t advantageous manner. Cattle, in&s;tru|ments, and grain to &s;ow the land were &s;ent in; cloaths and every material the little republic could want were provided, and every hand was as u&s;eful as we could wi&s;h. For four years <HI>(Azora</HI> continued to inform me), we lived in peace and tranquillity, and never once regretted the lo&s;s of our fortunes. We were happier far than when we had thou|&s;ands. Indu&s;try, knowledge, and religion, were our employment. The night to come of pain and death gave us no unea&s;ine&s;s. We lived as the chri&s;tians of the two fir&s;t centu|ries, and rather longed for than feared that event, which is to remove us to growing brightne&s;s for ever and ever. But a fever came in among us, and &s;wept away my fa|ther, and every man of our little republic: &s;everal women likewi&s;e peri&s;hed; but a hun|dred &s;ouls remained. Ninety-eight women, be&s;ides <HI>Antonia</HI> and <HI>Azora.</HI> The&s;e loved me too well <HI>(Azora</HI> continued) to abandon me; and as they were happily &s;ituated, and many of them had learned their hu&s;band's
<PB N="268" REF="283">trades, they agreed and &s;wore to &s;pend their lives with me here, and be as &s;erviceable as po&s;&s;ible, without admitting any men to live among us. They are &s;o in the highe&s;t degree: they are all u&s;eful and pious as I could wi&s;h them, and under the heavens there is not a happier &s;ociety of mortal.

<HEAD>A farther account of Azora</HEAD>
<P>Here <HI>Azora</HI> ended her relation,  and I wondered greatly at what I heard; nor did my admiration le&s;&s;en when I &s;aw how &s;he governed this community, and they em|ployed their time. Her great under&s;tanding enlightened and directed them, in the exe|cution of every thing &s;erviceable and inge|nious; and &s;he lived before their eyes an ex|ample of the greate&s;t indu&s;try, and the mo&s;t exalted piety. They, on the other hand, were as u&s;eful and religious as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;o heartily and faithfully di&s;charged &s;ocial duties, in every in&s;tance, that they &s;eemed as one great capacity and power at work, to promote every convenience and good. Some of them, as I have &s;aid, were at work in the gardens: others in the fields: various trades and occupations were going on within doors and without, and all were employed in ways that be&s;t &s;ub&s;erved the general welfare. In their behaviour, there was nothing wild, in|&s;olent, or arch, to be &s;een: no &s;wellings of vanity and pride: no pa&s;&s;ion to di&s;oblige: no
<PB N="269" REF="284">intention to offend: but, every one, di&s;creet and calm; good-humoured, and very civil; worthily &s;u&s;taining their various relations, and each attentive to her own incumbent duty. Their labours were but a diver&s;ion to them, and they lived in tranquillity and plenty. Their cloathing was coar&s;e, but very good, clean, and hand&s;ome. There was not one ragged or dirty per&s;on among them; nor any with bad &s;hoes and &s;tockings. In all re&s;pects, they &s;eemed a mo&s;t happy com|munity. <HI>Azora</HI> &s;tudied, to the utmo&s;t de|gree, the advantage and happine&s;s of the&s;e people: and they, in return, made their duty a vigorous and chearful &s;ervice. Mo&s;t of the conveniences and comforts of life they had within their own lit|tle territory; fle&s;h and fi&s;h, mutton, kid, and veni&s;on; corn for bread, every vege|table; malt-drink, meath, and cyder; all in great plenty, and mo&s;t excellent; wool and flax for clothing; good candles; and wood enough for firing. What things they wanted two of them rid for to the neare&s;t town, and not only purcha&s;ed &s;uch goods with the mo|ney they got by &s;ale of &s;everal commodities; e&s;pecially knit thread &s;tockings and gloves; but always at &s;uch times brought in &s;ome ca&s;h to their mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he gave part of it among the people, to buy them little things they fan&s;ied.</P>

<HEAD>Ten ex|traordinary country girls.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="270" REF="285">As to the ten young women I mentioned, who walked after <HI>Azora</HI> when fir&s;t I &s;aw her, they were the daughters of &s;ome wi|dows in this little republic, and by her cho&s;en, not only to be her attendants and upper &s;ervants, and to look after her dairy, her bees, her poultry; and her aviary; (which was the fine&s;t I have ever &s;een, for the variety of birds, and as it was turfed, to avoid the appearance of foulne&s;s on the floor, and &s;o large as to give the birds &s;ome freedom of flight); but, on account of their good un|der&s;tanding, in which they far excelled their fellows. The&s;e girls were carefully in&s;truct|ed by <HI>Azora</HI> and <HI>Antonia,</HI> and be&s;ide being taught the fine works of the needle, learned mu&s;ick, and the elements of the mathema|ticks from the ladies. The elde&s;t of the&s;e girls was but twenty, and the younge&s;t eigh|teen, and they all &s;urprized me very greatly with their quickne&s;s in an&s;wering very hard arithmetical que&s;tions. They could not only add, &s;ubtract, multiply, divide, find a fourth proportional, and extract roots of every kind, with exactne&s;s and readine&s;s, and apply them upon all common occa&s;ions; but, were per|fect in fractions vulgar and decimal. They had even gone as far in algebra as the re&s;o|lution of &s;imple equations.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="286">Finding them one morning at figures, I a&s;ked the younge&s;t of them, What was the number, that &frac23; of it with 4 over, amounted to the &s;ame as 7/12 of it with 9 over? She immediately tran&s;lated the que&s;tion from common language into algebra 2<HI>x</HI>/3 &plus; 4 &equals; 7<HI>x</HI>/12 &plus; 9: and quickly di&s;covered the unknown quantity <HI>x</HI> to be <HI>x</HI>&equals;60: Then &s;he took it in &s;inthetically, &frac23; of 60 &equals; 40 &plus; 4 &equals; 44: 7/12 of 60 &equals; 35 &plus; 9 &equals; 44. &mdash; <HI>(Sinthetically</HI> is tracing property from number: &mdash;<HI>Analetically</HI> is tracing number from property.) This made me wonder very greatly. I a&s;ked another of them, if &s;he bought 20 loaves for 16 pence, all of them two-penny, penny, and farthing ones &mdash; how many would &s;he have of each? She an&s;wered 5 two-penny loaves, 3 penny ones, and 12 farthing loaves; for the equations were <HI>x</HI> &plus; <HI>y</HI> &plus; <HI>z</HI> &equals; 20 and 8<HI>x</HI> &plus; 4<HI>y</HI> &equals; <HI>z</HI> &equals; 64.

<P>I a&s;ked a third, how many ways &s;he could pay 20 l. in pi&s;toles, guineas, and moidores, at 17 s. 21 s, and 27 s. the pi&s;tole, the guinea, and the moidore? &mdash; She replied in a very little time, 9 ways, to wit, 11 pi&s;toles, 5 gui|neas, and 4 moidores &mdash; 8 pi&s;toles, 1 guinea, 9 moidores&mdash; 8 pi&s;toles, 10 guineas, 2 moi|dores &mdash; 17 pi&s;toles, 4 guineas, 1 moidore &mdash; 2 pi&s;toles, 2 guineas, 12 moidores &mdash; 2 pi&s;toles,

<P>I a&s;ked another of the&s;e young women, if her lady gave her 297 guineas and 339 pi&s;toles, to pay 6 men a hundred pounds a-piece in gui|neas and pi&s;toles only, as was agreed, how could &s;he contrive to pay them, and di&s;patch the thing? I will tell you, &s;ir, (&s;he an&s;wered) very &s;oon. <HI>x</HI> repre&s;ents my guineas, and <HI>y</HI> my pi&s;toles, and 21<HI>x</HI> &plus; 17<HI>y</HI> &equals; 2000, of con&s;e|quence, x &equals; 2000 &minus; 17<HI>y</HI>/21 &equals; 95 &plus; 5 &minus; 17<HI>y</HI>/21; etc. and quickly di&s;covered, that the fir&s;t man &s;hould have 92 guineas and 4 pi&s;toles: &mdash; the &s;econd man, 75 guineas and 25 pi&s;toles: &mdash; the third, 58 guineas, 46 pi&s;toles &mdash; the fourth, 41 guineas and 67 pi&s;toles &mdash; the fifth, 24 gui|neas and 88 pi&s;toles: &mdash; and the &s;ixth man, 7 guineas and 109 pi&s;toles. This was admi|rable. But is there no other way I &s;aid of pay|ing 100 l. in guineas and pi&s;toles, be&s;ides the &s;ix ways you have mentioned? There is no other way: (the fine girl an&s;wered). If a &s;e|venth man was to be paid 100 l. in the&s;e two kinds of money, he mu&s;t be paid in one of the&s;e &s;ix methods. This was true. I was charmed with what I had heard.</P>

<HEAD>An ob&s;er|vation re|lative to the under|&s;tanding of women.</HEAD>
<P>By the way, I ob&s;erve, exclu&s;ive of the&s;e two ladies, that I have &s;een many of the
<PB N="274" REF="289">&s;ex who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for accuracy and comprehen&s;ivene&s;s, not only in the &s;cience, where known and required qualities are de|noted by letters, but in other fine parts of learning. I have little right to pretend to any thing extraordinary in under&s;tanding, as my genius is &s;low, and &s;uch as is common in the lower cla&s;&s;es of men of letters; yet, my application has been very great: my whole life has been &s;pent in reading and think|ing: and neverthele&s;s, I have met with ma|ny women, in my time, who, with very little reading, have been too hard for me on &s;everal &s;ubjects. In ju&s;tice, I de|clare this; and am very certain from what I have heard numbers of them &s;ay, and &s;een &s;ome of them write, that if they had the la|boured education the men have, and applied to books with all po&s;&s;ible attention for as many years as we do; there would be found among them as great <HI>divines</HI> as <HI>Epi&s;copius, Limborch, Whichcote, Barrow, Tillot&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Clarke;</HI> and as great <HI>mathematicians,</HI> as <HI>Mac|laurin, Saunder&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on.</HI> The cri|ticks may laugh at this a&s;&s;ertion, I know they will: and, if they plea&s;e, they may doubt my veracity as to what I relate of the two ladies, and the ten young women, in <HI>Burcot-Hamlet;</HI> but what I &s;ay is true not|with&s;tanding. Facts are things too &s;tub|born
<PB N="275" REF="290">to be de&s;troyed by laughing and doubt|ing.</P>
<P>As to the ladies I have mentioned, they both did wonders in <HI>&s;pecious arithmetick;</HI> but <HI>Azora</HI> was the brighte&s;t of the two, and in <HI>pure algebra,</HI> had gone much farther than <HI>Antonia.</HI> With wonder I beheld her, while &s;he an&s;wered the mo&s;t difficult que&s;tions as fa&s;t as fingers could move; and in the &s;olu|tion of cubics, and the re&s;olution of equa|tions, both according to <HI>Des Cartes</HI> laborious method, and the better univer&s;al way, by <HI>converging &s;eries,</HI> work with a celerity and truth beyond what I have ever &s;een any man do. Nor was it only algebra independent of geometry that &s;he under&s;tood. She could apply its rea&s;oning to geometrical figures, and de&s;cribe the loci of any equations by the mechanical motion of angles and lines. She was in this re&s;pect the greate&s;t prodigy I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>But it was not on account of this excel|lence that I &s;o much admired <HI>Azora,</HI> and honour her memory &s;o greatly as I do; nor becau&s;e &s;he talked &s;o excellently on various &s;ubjects, as I have related; but, for her knowledge of the truths of chri&s;tianity, and the habits of goodne&s;s &s;he had wrought into her &s;oul; for the care &s;he took of the people under her government, by communicating every felicity in her power, to their bodies
<PB N="276" REF="291">and minds; and the pure religion of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which &s;he publickly maintained, in all the beauty of holine&s;s, and in a ju&s;t fer|vor of practice. She was her&s;elf, in her manners and piety, a fine copy of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed women who conver&s;ed with our Lord and his apo&s;tles: and her &s;ociety, in inno|cence and goodne&s;s, in u&s;efulne&s;s and devo|tion, &s;eemed an epitome of the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church at Jeru&s;alem. Under a ju&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion of the mo&s;t heavenly principles they all lived, and &s;trictly regarded their &s;everal offi|ces. As the go&s;pel directs, they wor&s;hipped a <HI>fir&s;t cau&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Deity,</HI> as the di&s;ciples of the Chri&s;t of God, our holy mediator; and the authority of a Being of infinite wi&s;dom, and unchangeable rectitude of nature, had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon their minds, that they laboured continually to acquire that <HI>con|&s;ecration</HI> and <HI>&s;anctity</HI> of heart and manners, which our divine religion requires. Excellent community! happy would <HI>Europe</HI> be, if all her &s;tates were like this people. A fal&s;e re|ligion would not then prevail; nor would <HI>&s;u|per&s;tition</HI> be the <HI>idol</HI> to which the world bows down. The <HI>evils,</HI> which now di&s;honour human nature, and infe&s;t &s;ociety, would not be &s;een among us; nor tho&s;e <HI>exce&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>pa&s;|&s;ion</HI> be known, which are the parent of di&s;|cord and calamity, and render this lower world one &s;cene of &s;in and &s;orrow: but, as

Such were the people of <HI>Burcot-Hamlet. Azora</HI> and <HI>Antonia</HI> were indeed mo&s;t glorious wo|men

More than half of the twenty women that married, had twins the fir&s;t year, and all of them had &s;trong, healthy children. The ten extraordinary girls I mentioned, got very good hu&s;bands, and as <HI>Antonia</HI> was particularly kind to them on their marrying, and gave to all the wedded folks great encouragement in profitable gardens and hou&s;es, grain and cattle, they and their &s;pou&s;es became rather more dutiful and u&s;eful to their mi&s;tre&s;s and ruler than otherwi&s;e, and in grati|tude, and for the &s;ake of their children, did their be&s;t to plea&s;e Mrs. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> and encrea&s;e the common feli|city.

<P>By the way, reader, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that in travelling over that part of <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> which is called <HI>Stanemore,</HI> I found &s;everal &s;mall villages, that are not mentioned in <HI>Camden,</HI> or the <HI>Britannia Antiqua et Nova,</HI> or in <HI>England's Gazetteer;</HI> and tho' not &s;o pretty and happy as <HI>Burcot</HI> in the northern end of the <HI>fells</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmorland;</HI> yet in tolerable condition, and remark|able on account of &s;everal things and people; tho' they live intirely on what their &s;pot affords, and have little communication with their countrymen beyond the mountains that &s;eparate the inhabitants of <HI>Stanemore</HI> from the re&s;t of England. I took notice, in particu|lar, that altho' tho&s;e poor remote people had not facul|ties adapted to large mea&s;ures of knowledge, nor have mini&s;ters to teach them, or churches to pray in; yet they were not alienated from the ta&s;te and feelings of humanity, nor &s;trangers to the momentous principles of true chri&s;tianity. They had the bible, and could read it. They in&s;tructed their children in virtue and reli|gion, and lived them&s;elves as the intelligent &s;ubjects of an Almighty Governor; in a firm belief that God will di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>virtue</HI> and the <HI>offence</HI> of mankind <HI>hereaf|ter,</HI> by &s;uitable tokens of his <HI>favour,</HI> or <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI> All this I &s;aw in &s;everal villages of <HI>Stanemore-mountains.</HI> I lived for &s;ome time among the poor people: And I

where the be&s;t of things are to be had, I have always found travelling there as expen&s;ive as near London. Many I know give a different account: but the rea&s;on is, either they never were there; or, they travel in a pilgrim-like manner. You mu&s;t take care, then, to have money enough, if ever you undertake the north|ern expedition I have frequently gone upon: and as it is not &s;afe carrying much ca&s;h with you, for there are rogues in that part of the world, as well as in this; they rob even on <HI>Stanemore-road;</HI> and in riding over the great moor that lies between <HI>Brugh</HI> and <HI>Appleby,</HI> there is a little ale-hou&s;e to be &s;een at a good di&s;tance, on the right hand, at the entrance of a wood, at the bottom of a range of va&s;t fells, where high-way-men &s;ometimes re&s;ort: I was pur&s;ued by two of them, not long ago, and to the excellence of my hor&s;e, owed the &s;aving of my pur&s;e, and perhaps my life: they were well mounted, but I kept an hundred yards a-head of them for &s;everal miles, while, as fa&s;t as they could &s;tretch away, they cha&s;ed me till near the town of <HI>Brugh.</HI> I was all alone, my fellow having received a mi&s;chief, and being obliged to &s;tay a day behind; and the rogues did &s;wear and hoot mo&s;t horribly, and fired three &s;hots at me; but my hor&s;e was as good as ever &s;panked it along, and I cut him up, and pricked him over the turf, like the wind away:&mdash;I &s;ay, then, as it is not &s;afe travelling with all the money nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a long journey, the be&s;t way is, when ca&s;h runs low, to lie by to re&s;t for a week, and put your notes in order, in &s;ome town, and by one of the deal|ers, or manufacturers of the place, draw on your friend, or gold&s;mith in London, for what you want, and by the return of the po&s;t, you will be paid the money where you are. In this manner I did, when I was at <HI>Richmond</HI> la&s;t, in the north-riding of York&s;hire: Being


<PB N="283" REF="298">


in want of money, I a&s;ked a gentleman with whom I chanced to dine, how I could &s;upply my&s;elf with 20 l. by draft on one in the capital; and he directed me to his neighbour, who let me have what I had occa&s;ion for at moderate exchange, as &s;oon as he heard from his friend in <HI>London.</HI> I might have had any money I named in this way: and &s;o, in other places of trade.</P>
<P>I hope, reader, you will excu&s;e this little digre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it is meant well; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I imagine you will pardon me for advi&s;ing you, in the next place, (&s;hould the fates ever bring you to <HI>Catar|ractonium,</HI> in order to proceed to the northern extremity of our country), to go 4 miles out of your way to &s;ee <HI>Richmond</HI> town, before you &s;et out for <HI>Gretabridge,</HI> to <HI>Jo&s;eph Mar&s;hall</HI>'s, the be&s;t hou&s;e of the two inns there. The delightful, romantic &s;ituation of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and the fine curio&s;ities about the town, will afford you an agreeable entertainment for a couple of days; and if you like going at night to a club of very worthy, &s;en&s;i|ble men of this town, who are very civil to &s;trangers, you may pa&s;s the evening in a very plea&s;ing way; or if you have a ta&s;te for dancing, and prefer the conver&s;a|tion of a fine girl to a pipe and more &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, there is a &s;mall polite a&s;&s;embly of as pretty women as ever gladdened the heart of man. My method, while there, was to &s;moak one night with the club; and the next I devoted to the ladies. We made up ten couple, and had the <HI>hemp-dre&s;&s;ers</HI> one night, which is, you know, if you are a dancing reader, the mo&s;t difficult, and laborious of all the country dances; and no where have I &s;een the ground more actively beat, or, in ju&s;ter mea&s;ure. Life and truth and charms were in perfec|tion in tho&s;e <HI>Richmond</HI> girls. I was there in 29, 37, and 53, and the &s;en&s;ible club, and bright a&s;&s;embly,


<PB N="284" REF="299">


were &s;till in being; but no more than three did I &s;ee, of men or women, in 37, that was there in 29; and in 52, they were all &s;trangers to me. Some were married away; &s;ome had removed; and others were tran&s;lated to the &s;hades of eternity. This was to me a moral le&s;&s;on. When I looked round the a&s;&s;embly room the la&s;t time I was there, and found every glori|ous girl of my acquaintance was gone, and that years had rendered me almo&s;t unfit to join with the ladies then pre&s;ent, in the dancings of the night, a philo&s;ophical &s;adne&s;s came powerfully upon my mind, and I could not help &s;ighing in the mid&s;t of harmony, and a blaze of charms. This life, I &s;aw was a fleeting &s;cene indeed.</P>
<P>And now, reader, as to <HI>Stanemore-country,</HI> if it &s;hould ever come into your head, to wander over this wild and romantic part of our world, at the hazard of your neck, and the danger of being &s;tarved, your <HI>route</HI> is, when you have pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>turnpike</HI> on Stanemore, in your way to <HI>Brugh,</HI> to turn off to the right, beyond the public-hou&s;e, and a&s;cend a fine ri&s;ing valley you will &s;ee between two mountains, till you come to the top of the fir&s;t hills: then proceed, if you can, in the cour&s;e I have de&s;cribed, and wherever it is in your power, tend to the north ea&s;t, for that is the way out. This is one way into the heart of <HI>Stanemore</HI> in <HI>Richmond|&s;hire,</HI> and will bring you, by the way, among the dreadful northern fells of <HI>We&s;tmorland;</HI> a frightful coun|try, and a fatiguing march.</P>
<P>Another way to the <HI>Stanemore Alps,</HI> is behind <HI>Jack Railton</HI>'s, the quaker's hou&s;e at <HI>Bows.</HI> Hire a guide from him, and his man will bring you as he did me once through a very &s;urprizing way of deep bottoms to a public hou&s;e at <HI>Eggle&s;ton,</HI> on the border of <HI>Rich|mond-Stanemore.</HI> There re&s;t that night, and early the


<PB N="285" REF="300">


next morning, proceed due north, when you can, with another guide, and you will come to mountains upon mountains, rapid rivers, and headlong torrents, that form amazing and tremendous &s;cenes. Or, as this way is neither comfortable, nor very &s;afe, it is a better road to the confines, or beginning of <HI>Stanemore,</HI> to ride from <HI>Gretabridge</HI> to <HI>Bernard Ca&s;tle,</HI> and from <HI>Ber|nard Ca&s;tle</HI> to <HI>Eggle&s;ton,</HI> about 16 miles, as I judge, for it is not mea&s;ured, and then &s;et out for the moun|tains from <HI>Eggle&s;ton,</HI> as before directed.&mdash;I have been told there is another way into <HI>Stanemore,</HI> through <HI>Bi&s;hop|rick;</HI> but as I am a &s;tranger to it, I can only &s;ay what I have heard, that it is wor&s;e than the bottoms I went through from the quaker's hou&s;e.

<P><PB N="283" REF="298">Our fir&s;t labour was to a&s;cend a very nar|row &s;teep way in the &s;ide of a mountain, which went up due north for a full mile, and

From this water we rid due ea&s;t for half an hour, and then de&s;cended to a &s;andy valley, where flames were ri&s;ing from the ground.

While my eyes were entertained with the de&s;cending &s;cene, I fea&s;ted on a piece of veni&s;on pa&s;ty, and &s;ome fine ale, which, among other pro|vi&s;ions, Mrs. <HI>Burcot</HI> had ordered her &s;ervants to put up for me: but as I was thus happily engaged, my lad, <HI>O Fin,</HI> had climbed up to the top of the water-fall, and was going to land from a tree that grew out of the rocky mountain, near the &s;ummit of the hill, when his foot &s;lipt, and he came tumbling down in a mi&s;erable way. I expected him in pieces on the ground, as I had him full in my view. There &s;eemed no po&s;&s;ibility of an e&s;cape: and yet he received no harm. In the middle of
<PB N="288" REF="303">the de&s;cent, he &s;tuck in another projecting thick tree, and from it came &s;afely down. This was a deliverance. Providence often &s;aves us in a wonderful manner, 'till the work appointed to be fini&s;hed is done, or the limited time of our trial over. In relation to &s;uch e&s;capes, I could give my&s;elf as an in|&s;tance many a time, and will here mention one extraordinary ca&s;e.</P>

<P>Now from this antique piece verbally tran&s;lated, I think it is evident, that the kings of the four provinces of Ireland were not &s;uch poor and ignorant chiefs as they are generally imagined to be; and of con&s;equence, that one of the four, to whom the other three did homage, and who was therefore called the king of Ire|land, was always a potent prince, and could do great matters, when they were all united. This con&s;ideration, I fan&s;y, (and the <HI>addre&s;s</HI> let me add of <HI>An&s;elm,</HI> archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and of Lanfranc, archbi&s;hop of the &s;ame &s;ee, to <HI>Mortogh O Brien</HI> king of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Terlah O Brien</HI> king of <HI>Ireland, Moriardacho Glorio&s;o</HI> and <HI>Terae|luacho Magnifico,</HI> To the <HI>mo&s;t magnificent Terlagh O Brien, king of Ireland,</HI> our benediction, etc. as you may read them at large in <HI>U&s;her's Primordia</HI>

There was no end of eating and drinking there, and the famous <HI>Downe Falvey</HI> played on the harp. For a day and a night we &s;at

When I came above water, I &s;wam very ea&s;ily out of the pit, and walked up the low &s;ide of the quarry as &s;ober as if I had not drank a gla&s;s.

<HEAD>49. 1725. June 11. The jour|ney con|tinued.</HEAD>
<P> Having dined, and &s;hot a <HI>bu&s;tard</HI> that weighed forty pounds, I went on again, the cour&s;e north-we&s;t for half a mile, and then, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, it trended to the &s;outh for more than an hour; which was going back again: but at la&s;t it turned about, and for half an hour, we went to the north|we&s;t again, and then due ea&s;t for a long time, till we came to hills upon hills that were
<PB N="293" REF="308">very difficult to pa&s;s. We were obliged to alight at many of them, and walk them up and down, which was a delay of many hours: but we did it at la&s;t, and came into a large &s;andy opening, that had a num|ber of rapid &s;treams breaking over it, that fell from the mountains, and with the fore&s;t on the &s;urrounding hills, formed a very wild and plea&s;ing &s;cene. Over this we went for half a mile, and then came to a long glin, &s;o very deep and narrow, that it was quite night when we got to the bottom of it, tho' the &s;un was not yet down; and it brought to my re|membrance <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI>'s &s;on, the wandering prince of <HI>Troy,</HI> when he de&s;cended to the &s;hades below. It had the appearance indeed of &s;ome &s;uch pa&s;s, and was a frightful way, as hills, like <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> and <HI>Atlas,</HI> were clo&s;e on either hand of us, and a river roared thro' the bottom of the &s;teep de&s;cent; which we were obliged to walk down on foot. This could not be the right road I was certain. <HI>Azora</HI> and <HI>Antonia</HI> could never pa&s;s this deep and rapid flood. It was too much for any man to venture into, without knowing where the torrent went, or how the channel of the river was form'd.</P>
<P>Up then I came again to the day, and re|&s;olved to pa&s;s the night at the foot of one of the woody hills, on the margin of the &s;treams that &s;ounded &s;weetly over the &s;hoars:
<PB N="294" REF="309">but how to proceed the next morning I knew not. As my paper of directions did not mention the dark &s;teep de&s;cent we had been down, but a little valley that lay due ea&s;t, through which we were to go: no &s;uch vale could we &s;ee, and of con&s;equence, in &s;ome turning of the road, we had gone wrong.</P>
<P>When I came among the trees, on the &s;ide of one of the mountains, I began to look for &s;ome convenient re&s;ting place, while my two boys were picking the bu&s;tard, and preparing a fire to roa&s;t it for &s;upper, and wandered a good way till I &s;aw a pretty hermitage in an open plain like a ring, and going up to it, found the &s;keleton of a man. He lay on a couch in an inward room without any cover|ing, and the bones were as clean and white as if they had come from the &s;urgeons hands. The pi&s;mires to be &s;ure had eaten off the fle&s;h. Who the man was, a paper lying on the table in a &s;trong box informed me. It was called the ca&s;e of <HI>John Orton.</HI></P>

<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="account">
<P>I was twenty years old when <HI>Charles the Second</HI> was re&s;tored, and being ma&s;ter of large fortunes, and educated in an aver&s;ion to puritans and republican principles, went into all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and impieties, which over&s;pread and corrupted this nation, when
<PB N="295" REF="310">that profligate prince a&s;cended the throne. I drank up to the exce&s;s of the times: I de|bauched every woman I could get within my power, by gold, treachery, or force; maid, wife, and widow: I murdered &s;everal men in duels; and bla&s;phemed the God of Hea|ven continually. The <HI>devil</HI> was my fir&s;t and la&s;t <HI>toa&s;t;</HI> and, in a club I belonged to, I proceeded to &s;uch &s;carce credible wickedne&s;s, as to perform the part of the prie&s;t in our infer|nal &s;odality, and after u&s;ing the words of con&s;ecration over the elements, gave the prophane bread and wine in the mo&s;t horrible manner. I was the mo&s;t abominable of mortals. Contrary to all the dictates and principles of wi&s;dom, virtue, and honour I acted; bound my&s;elf in bondage to <HI>Sa|tan;</HI> and lived the mo&s;t execrable &s;lave to the vile&s;t inclinations, and mo&s;t heinous ha|bits. <HI>Scratch</HI> was the name I had for the <HI>evil one,</HI> and upon all occa&s;ions I invoked him. The la&s;t words I &s;aid every night, after lying down, were, &mdash; <HI>Scratch, tuck me in.</HI></P>
<P>In this diabolical manner did I pa&s;s my life away till I was forty, and in twenty years time committed every evil that can di&s;honour human manners, and infe&s;t &s;ociety. I was a di&s;grace to my &s;pecies, and unworthy of the name of man.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="311">But as I went on in this manner, and glo|ried only in outdoing the greate&s;t &s;celerates in impiety and debauchery,&mdash;in being the chief in&s;trument of <HI>Satan,</HI> and &s;triving to bring every &s;oul I got acquainted with, in &s;ubjection to the fle&s;h and the devil; malici|ou&s;ly committing all manner of &s;in; and with greedine&s;s executing the &s;ugge&s;tions of a defiled imagination, and the purpo&s;es of the mo&s;t corrupt heart; I was &s;truck one night with the mo&s;t excruciating torments of body; and had, at the &s;ame time, &s;uch un|&s;peakable horrors upon my mind, that I be|lieve my condition re&s;embled the &s;tate of the damned. The tortures all over my frame, were beyond the pains any rack could cau&s;e; but were le&s;s afflicting than the <HI>panick fear</HI> that harrowed my &s;oul under a lively &s;en&s;e of eternal vengeance, for the crying enormi|ties and impurities of my life. All my crim|&s;on crimes were held as in a mirror before me; the mo&s;t diabolical impieties again&s;t heaven, and the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelties to men; the numbers I had drank to death, and &s;ecured in the &s;ervice of hell; the men I had &s;ent to the other world by combat at pi&s;tol and &s;word; and the women I had ruined, not only in this life, but perhaps, for evermore; the mi&s;eries I had brought upon families, and the manifold afflictions I had been the author of for years after years,
<PB N="297" REF="312">by night and by day;&mdash;all the&s;e offences I &s;aw like the hand-writing on the wall, and in a horror and con&s;ternation of mind, that words cannot de&s;cribe, lay a mi&s;erable &s;pec|tacle for two nights and two days. Tor|mented, perplexed, and confounded, I rolled from &s;ide to &s;ide, and condemned my&s;elf and my folly in the mo&s;t doleful complaints; but dared not look up to a ju&s;t Judge and offended God. No &s;lumber for this time did approach my eyes; but in agonies I &s;hook with a frightful violence, and thought every moment, that the demons my fancy had in view, were going to force my mi&s;erable &s;oul away to everla&s;ting inflictions, in the mo&s;t di&s;mal cavern of hell. Spent, however, at la&s;t, I fell into a &s;hort &s;leep. I had half an hour's re&s;t, and in that &s;lumber imagined, I heard a &s;mall voice &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;|rael. Rent your heart, and not your gar|ments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, &s;low to anger, and of great kindne&s;s, and repenteth him of the evil.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this I awaked, and found my pains were gone. To heaven I lift my eyes, and as the tears poured down my face, cried out
<PB N="298" REF="313">to God for mercy. <HI>O God be merciful to me a &s;inner. Have mercy on me du&s;t and &s;in, the vile&s;t of all &s;inful creatures. To me belongs nothing but &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face eter|nally. My portion &s;hould in ju&s;tice be the lake of everla&s;ting fire and brim&s;tone. But O Lord God mo&s;t mighty, O holy and mo&s;t merciful Fa|ther,</HI> to thee <HI>belongeth infinite goodne&s;s and forgivene&s;s. O remember not my &s;ins and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions&mdash;my great and numberle&s;s provoca|tions, and my tre&s;pa&s;&s;es that are grown up even unto heaven. Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodne&s;s, and according to the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine offences. I have a hearty &s;en&s;e and dete&s;tation of all my abominations, and with a true con|trition of heart, I repent of all my iniquities. Wa&s;h me, then, I be&s;eech thee, O Father of mercies; wa&s;h my polluted &s;oul in the blood of the holy Je&s;us, and forgive me all my &s;ins, as I offer up a troubled &s;pirit, and a broken and contrite heart, which thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed not to de&s;pi&s;e.&mdash;And grant, O Lord God, my Father, that I may from this hour, by the gui|dance and direction of thy &s;anctifying &s;pirit, bid a final adieu to all ungodline&s;s and iniquity; and con&s;ecrate my&s;elf intirely to thee, to &s;erve thee with humility, love and devotion, and for the remainder of my life, give thee the &s;acri|fices of righteou&s;ne&s;s, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="314">When I had thus implored the mercy of the Almighty, in a torrent of tears, with &s;trong cryings, I found my heart quite ea&s;y, and my mind &s;o filled with delights and com|forts, that I cannot de&s;cribe the &s;trange hap|pine&s;s of my condition: but how to &s;ecure this felicity was the que&s;tion. I was afraid of the world, and trembled when I thought of its temptations: be&s;ide, the great wicked|ne&s;s of my pa&s;t life made it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould live in an extraordinary &s;tate of peni|tence, and by great mortification and piety, make what amends I could for &s;inning again&s;t heaven in the mo&s;t atrocious manner; and wilfully, for a long &s;eries of years, breaking every law of the ju&s;t and holy governor of the world. A change of mind, and com|mon piety, were not enough for &s;uch a wretch as I had been. I was unworthy of the innocent comforts of life. I ought to breathe in &s;ighs, and &s;peak in groans. I re|&s;olved then to be a <HI>reform</HI> indeed, and in this part of <HI>Stanemore</HI> mountains, which I was well acquainted with, &s;pend the re|mainder of my days, in the labours of a pe|nitential piety.</P>
<P>As I had no relations living, I &s;old what e|&s;tates I had left, and gave almo&s;t the whole mo|ney among the poor. With the little I kept, I bought what nece&s;&s;ary things I &s;hould want in my &s;olitude; and with tools and &s;eeds,
<PB N="300" REF="315">&s;ome cloaths and linnen, a few books, and other little matters, retired to this &s;pot in the year 1681. I had &s;ome working men from the next village, to build me the little hut I live in; to &s;ow my garden with every vege|table, and put &s;ome fruit-trees in the ground; to cut me a pile of firing from the woody hills; and make my place as convenient as my intended life could require. All this was &s;oon done, and then I was left alone; in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing I had a wi&s;h for in this world. It is now twenty years &s;ince my arrival here, and in all the time, I have not had one &s;ick or di&s;mal hour. My garden and my cottage employ me in agreeable la|bours, to furni&s;h my table with roots and fruits; which is what I mo&s;tly live on; ha|ving nothing more but goats milk, and now and then a &s;ea-bi&s;cuit; my drink being wa|ter, and &s;ometimes a cup of meath of my own making.</P>
<P>When I am weary of working, I &s;it down to &s;tudy my <HI>Bible,</HI> and in that mo&s;t perfect trea&s;ure of &s;aving knowledge, I find &s;uch joys and &s;atisfactions as make my life a &s;cene of heavenly happine&s;s, and charm me into raptures the nearer I approach to the hour of my di&s;&s;olution. That will be a ble&s;&s;ed hour. By the amazing mercy of God, vouch&s;afed through the Lord Je&s;us, my crim&s;on &s;ins are pardoned; and when the voice of the Son of

If, like me, thou ha&s;t been betrayed by the <HI>demons</HI> into great impieties and pre&s;umptuous &s;ins, an ha&s;t been per&s;uaded to abdicate heaven, and its eternal hopes, in exchange for illicit gratifications of every kind, and the plea&s;ures of this world; then, like me, repent, and in tears and mortification, implore the mercy of heaven. Turn to the everla&s;ting Father of mercies, and the God of all comforts, after his own manner, with humility, &s;orrow, and re&s;olutions of amendment, and in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, implore his com|pa&s;&s;ion and forgivene&s;s, and he will repent and turn unto thee. He will wa&s;h you in the blood of Je&s;us, and make you whiter than &s;now. When he &s;ees the &s;inner a great way off in tears, fa&s;ting, and prayer, he will run unto him, and fall upon his neck and ki&s;s him. You will become the beloved of the Father, and be rein&s;tated in the favor of
<PB N="302" REF="317">the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious of immortal Beings. He will ble&s;s you here with that peace that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding. He will ble&s;s you for ever hereafter with glory and honour in the kingdom he has prepared for the benevolent, the pure, and the hone&s;t. But if you continue to offend your Creator, and violate the laws of the God of heaven, then will you live expo&s;ed to judgments in this world, and mo&s;t certainly will depart in confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. The demons you obeyed will gather round the pale, the guil|ty, the affrighted gho&s;t of you, eager to in|volve your wretched &s;pirit in their own hor|rors, and will drag it to their di&s;mal regions. And when all the monuments of human power, wealth and pride &s;hall be overthrown; the earth it&s;elf be in a blaze, and the &s;ea turned into vapours, at the de&s;cent of the Son of God, to judge the va&s;t congregation of the &s;ons of men, the amazing a&s;&s;embly of mortals, unheard of generations rai&s;ed from the grave, to have all their actions tried; every condition everla&s;tingly determined; then will you be placed in that divi&s;ion which will call upon the rocks to hide them, and the hills to cover them from the face of the Judge; but in vain attempt to &s;ecret them|&s;elves from an infinite eye, and an Almighty power.

<HEAD>51. A reflexion on the bones of John Orton.</HEAD>
<P> This extraordinary paper &s;urprized me very greatly, and when from reading it, I turned my eyes to the <HI>bones</HI> of <HI>John Orton,</HI> I could not help breaking out in the following reflection &mdash; And is this the once lively, gallant, drinking
<PB N="305" REF="320"><HI>Jack Orton,</HI> who thought for forty years that he was made for no higher end than to gra|tify every appetite, and pa&s;s away time in a continual circle of vanity and plea&s;ure! <HI>Poor &s;keleton,</HI> what a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle art thou! Not the lea&s;t remain of activity and joy, of that &s;prightline&s;s and levity of mind, that jo|cund humour and frolic, which rendered thee the delight of the wild &s;ocieties of thy youthful time: Grim, &s;tiff, and horrid, is the appearance now: vain mirth and luxury, licentious plays and &s;ports, can have no con|nection with the&s;e dry bones.</P>
<P><HI>O Death,</HI> what a change do&s;t thou make! The bulk of mankind are aver&s;e to &s;erious thought, and hearken to the pa&s;&s;ions more than to the dictates of rea&s;on and religion: To kill time, and bani&s;h reflection, they in|dulge in a round of di&s;&s;ipations, and revel in the freedom of vicious exce&s;&s;es: Their at|tention is engro&s;&s;ed by &s;pectacle and enter|tainments, and fixed to follies and trifles: giddy and unthinking, loo&s;e and voluptuous, they &s;pend their precious hours in the gay &s;cenes of diver&s;ions, pomp and luxury; and as if the grave and a judgment to come, were a romance of former times, or things from which they are &s;ecured, never think of the&s;e important and momentous &s;ubjects: with minds bewitched by exorbitant plea|&s;ure, and faculties enervated and broken by
<PB N="306" REF="321">idle mirth and vanity, they pa&s;s their every day away without any of that con&s;ideration which becomes rea&s;onable beings, and crea|tures de&s;igned for a &s;tate of immortality: bu at la&s;t, you appear, and in a moment turn delight and admiration, into aver&s;ion and horror: &s;trength, wealth, and charms, you in&s;tantly reduce to weakne&s;s, poverty, and deformity, in the fir&s;t place; and then, to a &s;keleton, like the bones before me.</P>
<P>Nor is this the wor&s;t of the great revo|lution. When death approaches, the amu&s;e|ments of &s;en&s;e immediately fail, and pa&s;t tran&s;actions, in every circum&s;tance of aggra|vation, crowd into the mind: con&s;cience re|proaches loudly, the heart condemns, and the &s;ick tremble at the apprehen&s;ions of a vengeance they laughed at in the days of di|ver&s;ion, and the midnight hours of the ball: as they come near the black valley, they &s;ee the realities of a future &s;tate; and agonies con|vul&s;e their &s;ouls: terrors till then unknown enter their brea&s;ts; and, in anxieties that are incapable of being uttered, and expectations the mo&s;t torturing, on a review of life, they pa&s;s from the plains of time into the ocean of eternity. Here lies the frame, like the <HI>dry bones</HI> before me; but, the &s;oul is gone to the &s;e&s;&s;ions of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and perhaps, the dreadful &s;entence of the divine ju&s;tice is pronounced on it. This is a tremendous
<PB N="307" REF="322">affair, that calls for timely and &s;erious con|&s;ideration. <HI>Eternity! Eternal mi&s;ery! They that have done evil, to come forth unto the re|&s;urrection of damnation!</HI></P>
<P>I will take thy advice then, thou <HI>glorious penitent, John Orton;</HI> and &s;ince it is in my power to come forth unto the re&s;urrection of life, and obtain <HI>immortality, honour,</HI> and <HI>glory,</HI> with the <HI>righteous,</HI> in the <HI>kingdom of their father,</HI> I will open the <HI>reforming go&s;|pel</HI> night and morning, and by its heavenly directions regulate my conduct. I am de|termined to make a wi&s;e and &s;erious prepa|ration for death and judgment. To the be&s;t of my power, I will provide for that <HI>day,</HI> when the <HI>prayers</HI> and <HI>charities</HI> of the righ|teous will be brought forth as their <HI>memorials</HI> before the <HI>tribunal</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This &mdash; this is the thing to be minded. The brighte&s;t &s;cenes of worldly pro&s;perity, and grandeur, are contemptible, when they do not accord with virtue and piety. Death, in a few years, blends the prince and the meane&s;t &s;ubject, the conqueror and the &s;lave, the &s;tate&s;man, the warrior, and the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, in one promi&s;cuous ruin; and the &s;chemes, the competi|tions, and the intere&s;ts, which have en|gaged the chief attention of the world, are brought to nothing, and appear, too often, ridiculous: but righteou&s;ne&s;s is unchangeably
<PB N="308" REF="323">glorious, and in the univer&s;al ruin, receives no detriment: when all human power and policy will be extinct; <HI>concealed piety</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecuted virtue,</HI> will again appear, and be <HI>owned as His by the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in that day when he maketh up his jewels.</HI></P>
<P>I will love thee therefore, O Lord, my &s;trength; yea, I will love thee: and it ever &s;hall be my heart's de&s;ire, that my &s;oul may behold by faith in its &s;elf, as in a gla&s;s, the glory of the Lord, able and ready to change it into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, reflected upon, and conveyed to it by the Spirit of the Lord. May my portion here be this ble&s;&s;ed transforming union, that I may be made partaker of the divine nature, by impre&s;&s;ions from it 

<NOTE N="(24.)" PLACE="foot"><P>The expre&s;&s;ion &mdash; partaker of the divine na|ture by impre&s;&s;ions from it, may, perhaps, be thought by &s;ome readers, to approach to vi&s;ion; and to contra|dict my own opinion before delivered, in relation to this &s;ubject: let me ob&s;erve then, that by <HI>impre&s;&s;ion,</HI> I here mean no more, than <HI>bright beams of light</HI> ca&s;t upon the &s;oul by the <HI>pre&s;ent Deity;</HI> as he &s;its <HI>all power, all knowledge,</HI> in the <HI>heart,</HI> and di&s;pen&s;es &s;uch rays of wi&s;|dom to the pious petitioner, as are &s;ufficient to procure a la&s;ting &s;en&s;e of &s;piritual heavenly things. God is not only in heaven. He dwelleth indeed in the heaven of heavens after the mo&s;t glorious manner, as the High and Lofty One, and by &s;ome &s;plendid appearance, ma|nife&s;ts a pre&s;ence to the &s;en&s;es of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits 

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As to the expre&s;&s;ion ju&s;t now u&s;ed, to wit, that this <HI>infinite Spirit</HI> manife&s;ts him&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es of his ble&s;&s;ed

<PB N="309" REF="324">


&s;ubjects &mdash; it may be a&s;ked how this can be &mdash; can the eye behold what is <HI>infinite</HI> and <HI>invi&s;ible?</HI></P>
<P>The an&s;wer is this, that although God's e&s;&s;ence be <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> yet there is a <HI>glory,</HI> the <HI>train</HI> and <HI>attendance</HI> of his e&s;&s;ence, which exhibits a <HI>bodily</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ible vi&s;ion</HI> of God. <HI>He decketh him&s;elf with light as with a garment.</HI> This is the <HI>dwelling</HI> of his e&s;&s;ence. <HI>He dwelleth in light that is unapproachable.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h then between the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> and the <HI>maje&s;tatic</HI> pre&s;ence of God. The <HI>majc&s;tatic</HI> pre&s;ence is the di&s;covery of his <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> pre&s;ence in a determinate place by a <HI>magnificent luminous appearance;</HI> and this the apo&s;tle calls the <HI>excellent glory &mdash; megaloprepous doxes.</HI> This glory appeared on Mount Sinai &s;ix days together. It re&s;ted and dwelt in the &s;anctuary. It filled the hou&s;e. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aw its <HI>back parts,</HI> that is, a &s;mall mea&s;ure and &s;cantling of it, in proportion to the weakne&s;s of his mor|tal eyes: but, in the other world, when <HI>mortals &s;hall have put on immortality,</HI> and our bodies &s;hall be inve&s;ted with the <HI>new powers</HI> of <HI>&s;pirituality</HI> and <HI>incorruption, then face to face:</HI> we &s;hall be able to &s;ee the whole lu&s;tre of divine Maje&s;ty as familiarly as one man behold|eth the face of another.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As grateful objects of &s;en&s;e make up a great part of human delectation; may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that this glory of God, accommodated to our &s;en&s;es, will produce a more ravi&s;hing and tran&s;cendent delight, than all the objects in nature are capable of producing?</P></NOTE>

</P>

<PB N="310" REF="325">


<P>There are two ways then, (as an excellent one ob|&s;erves) of &s;eeing God, to wit, <HI>by intelligence,</HI> and, in &s;ome manner, by &s;en&s;e: but we mu&s;t not imagine that the&s;e two make up the <HI>beatific vi&s;ion.</HI> There is a cau&s;e of more importance to beatitude. The &s;ight and con|templation of the <HI>divine glories</HI> is our act; but the act of God is the communication of them. This makes the &s;aints <HI>perfectly ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> By the <HI>communication</HI> of the <HI>divine glories,</HI> we come to be, not bare &s;pectators, but, <HI>theias koinonoi phu&s;eos, partakers of the divine nature.</HI></P>
<P>As we are more obliged, (&s;ays the writer I have men|tioned) to the <HI>&s;un</HI> (who is the cheer and vigor of nature, and the very life of all animal and vegetable beings), for his influences than for his &s;ight: &mdash; &s;o are the heavenly inhabitants much more obliged to God for their recep|tions from him as the &s;ountain of life and wi&s;dom, than for the &s;ight and contemplation of him as the &s;ubject of perfection. This illu&s;trates the matter; and we may &s;ay, there is a third way of &s;eeing God, to wit, in the <HI>enjoyment of him;</HI> the <HI>beamings of his favor,</HI> and the <HI>ef|fu&s;ions of his love,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thro' the whole man, and pro|ducing an intimate &s;en&s;ation of him both in body and &s;oul, and filling both with an unconceivable and endle&s;s delectation. This is &s;eeing God as he is.</P><PB N="308" REF="323"></NOTE>

<HEAD>52. A medita|tion in a clo&s;et.</HEAD>
<P>Such was the <HI>&s;oliloquy</HI> I &s;poke,  as I gazed on the <HI>&s;keleton</HI> of <HI>John Orton;</HI> and ju&s;t as I had ended, the boys brought in the wild turkey, which they had very ingeniou&s;ly roa&s;ted, and with &s;ome of Mrs. <HI>Burcot</HI>'s fine ale and bread, I had an excellent &s;upper. The bones of the <HI>penitent Orton</HI> I removed to a hole I had ordered my lad to dig for them; the &s;kull excepted, which I kept, and &s;till keep on my table, for a <HI>memento mori;</HI> and that I may never forget the good le&s;&s;on, which the percipient who once re|&s;ided in it, had given. It is often the &s;ub|ject of my meditation.

<HEAD>53. An inven|tory of the goods of John Or|ton.</HEAD>
<P> When I had &s;upped, I went about, to &s;ee what things Mr. <HI>Orton</HI> had left behind him in his little cottage, and I found a field bed-&s;tead large enough for two, with a mat|tra&s;s, &s;ilk blankets, quilt, and cotton cur|tains; two oak &s;tools, and a &s;trong &s;quare table of the &s;ame wood. An oak &s;ettee, on which his bones lay; a &s;ilver lamp to burn oil in; a tinder-box and matches; a ca&s;e of razors; &s;ix hand&s;ome knives and forks in a ca&s;e; half a dozen china plates, two china di&s;hes; and two pint mugs of the &s;ame ware; half a dozen drinking-gla&s;&s;es, a large copper kettle, a bra&s;s &s;killet, two &s;ilver &s;poons, and a &s;ilver ladle; in a che&s;t were cloaths and linnen, &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and various u&s;eful mat|ters. There were pens, ink, and paper in a wri|ting-de&s;k, and half a &s;core guineas; and on a &s;helf over it, a dozen good books; three of which were, a large <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> bible, <HI>Thomas a Kempis,</HI> and Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s hi&s;tory of the world: under the &s;helf hung a plain gold watch, and a large ring &s;un-dial. In a dark
<PB N="313" REF="328">clo&s;et, I found a box of &s;ea-bi&s;kets, many fla&s;ks of oil for eating, and jars of it for the lamp; honey, &s;alt, and vinegar; four dozen of quart bottles of meath, and two &s;tone bottles, that held three gallons each, full of brandy: this I &s;uppo&s;e was again&s;t the days of weakne&s;s or &s;ickne&s;s. He had not u&s;ed a pint of this liquor.</P>
<P>Having found the&s;e things within doors, I proceeded from the hou&s;e to the garden, which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the little thatched man&s;ion, and contained about four acres; it had been very beautifully laid out, and filled with the be&s;t fruit-trees, and all the vegetables: but it was run to ruin and high weeds, and &s;hewed that its owner had been long dead. I &s;uppo&s;e he died &s;oon af|ter the date of his paper; for, I ob&s;erved, that many prior dates had been &s;truck out; and had he lived after the year 1701, he would, in all probability, have razed that likewi&s;e, and &s;et down 1702. Some &s;udden &s;ickne&s;s mu&s;t have &s;eized him; and perhaps, when he found him&s;elf &s;inking, he laid him|&s;elf out naked on the wooden couch where I found his <HI>&s;keleton.</HI> I can no otherwi&s;e ac|count for his having no kind of covering over him. As to his bones being &s;o clean, that to be &s;ure was performed by the ants. I took notice of many ne&s;ts here of the larger ants, in holes under the roots of great trees.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="329">That the <HI>pi&s;mires</HI> are the be&s;t <HI>preparers</HI> of a <HI>&s;keleton</HI> is not only certain from the account the mi&s;&s;ionaries give of the coming on of the <HI>ants</HI> in <HI>Pegu;</HI> when in one night's time, the va&s;t &s;warms of them that approach, re|duce every human creature they can fa&s;ten on to clean bones; which makes the people &s;et fire to their habitations, when they have notice given them by a kind of &s;mall mon|key they keep for the purpo&s;e of the motion of this terrible enemy: but it is plain from what I have often experimented.</P>
<P>When I want to make a &s;keleton of any &s;mall animal, I put the dead creature in a box with holes in it among the ants, in their habitations, or ne&s;ts, or in &s;uch parts of the hou&s;e as a whole tribe will often march to, through &s;everal rooms, in one track or cer|tain road, to eat &s;ugar or &s;weatmeats they have di&s;covered, and then in two or three days, they will perform what the fine&s;t knife cannot execute. The big ants which are larger than a common hou&s;e fly, and are &s;eldom le&s;s than &s;ix thou&s;and in a ne&s;t, will clear the bones of a rat in half a night's time.</P>
<P>There was a pretty little wooden &s;ummer-hou&s;e in the centre of the garden, and in it had been in pots &s;ome curious plants and flowers. Here were various tools, and many in&s;truments of gardening. It appeared from
<PB N="315" REF="330">them, and the great variety of things in the ground, that Mr. <HI>Orton</HI> mu&s;t have u&s;ed him&s;elf to hard labour, and found great plea&s;ure in his improvements and produc|tions. There was a deal of art and ingenuity to be traced in the wild wilderne&s;s the garden was grown into. It was plain from a book, called the <HI>Carthu&s;ian gardener,</HI> which lay on a table in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, that he had made that bu&s;ine&s;s his &s;tudy. Round this &s;ummer-hou&s;e were the remains of many hives on benches, but the bees were all gone, and the &s;tock ruined.</P>

<P>All the&s;e things, and the place,  &s;et me a thinking, and &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted to my fancy, that in my condition, I could not do better than &s;ucceed Mr. <HI>Orton</HI> on the pre|mi&s;&s;es; but, without turning hermit. Here is (I &s;aid) a pretty &s;mall thatched man&s;ion, that might ea&s;ily be enlarged, if more rooms were wanting; and a garden, which labour would &s;oon re&s;tore to its u&s;efulne&s;s and beau|ty, and make it produce the be&s;t vegetables in plenty. Here is fi&s;h in the waters, fowl of every kind, and deer on the mountains. Here are goats in great herds, for milk, for kids, and when cut, for excellent veni&s;on. Here is the fine&s;t water, and by getting bees, as Mr. <HI>Orton</HI> had, meath may be made that will be equal to the be&s;t foreign wine. As to the &s;ituation, it is mo&s;t delightful. No|thing
<PB N="316" REF="331">can be more charming than the&s;e &s;hores and breaking waters, the rocky precipices and the woody hills, which &s;urround this little region. What then &s;hould hinder but that I here &s;it down, and put an end to my adventures; as the few things that are want|ing may be had at the next town, and a &s;tock for years be in a few days &s;ecured? The man I am looking for may never be found; and if I &s;hould meet with him, his circum&s;tances and temper may be changed: then, as to the world, I know not how to deal in any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s; and to live on the &s;mall fortune in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t reduce me to poverty very &s;oon. Here then it is good for me to re&s;ide, and make my&s;elf as happy as I can, if it be not in my power to be as happy as I would. I have two lads with me, who are active, u&s;eful young men, willing to work, and plea&s;ed to &s;tay where|ever I am; and if I can commence a <HI>matri|monial</HI> relation with &s;ome &s;en&s;ible, good-humoured, dear delightful girl of the moun|tains, and per&s;uade her to be the chearful partner of my &s;till life, <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> will create the highe&s;t &s;cenes of felicity, and we &s;hall live as it were in the &s;uburbs of heaven. My lads too may pick up among the hills, upon <HI>&s;cripture principles,</HI> two bouncing females: and a &s;tate will in a little time be formed. This is fine. For
<PB N="317" REF="332">once in my life I am fortunate. And &s;up|po&s;e, this partner I want in my &s;olitude could be Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth,</HI> one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;creet of women; a thinking bloom, and good-humour it&s;elf in a human figure; then indeed I mu&s;t be happy in this &s;ilent, romantic &s;tation. This &s;pot of earth would then have all the felicities. &mdash; Re&s;olved. <HI>Conclu&s;um e&s;t contra Manicheos,</HI> &s;aid the great <HI>St. Au&s;tin,</HI> and with a thump of his fi&s;t, he cracked the table.</P>

<HEAD>55. A fine rural &s;cene.</HEAD>
<P>Thus was my head employed,  while I &s;moaked a pipe after &s;upper, and I deter|mined to return to <HI>Orton's man&s;ion,</HI> after I had found a way out of <HI>Stanemore:</HI> but the previous que&s;tion was, how I &s;hould get out of the place I was in, without going back, as there appeared no pa&s;&s;age onwards. I tried every angle the next morning, to no pur|po&s;e, and in vain attempted &s;ome hills that were too &s;teep for the hor&s;es. Down then again I went to the bottom of the black and narrow glin afore-mentioned, and with lights ob&s;erved the rumbling deep river. It appeared more frightful than the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it, and there was no venturing into it. This troubled me not a little, as the water was not above eight yards broad, and there was an a&s;cending glin on the other &s;ide of it, that appeared to ri&s;e into a fine woody coun|try. It was not half the length of that we
<PB N="318" REF="333">had de&s;cended, nor near &s;o &s;teep; it began to widen at the di&s;tance of a hundred yards from the water, &s;o as to &s;hew, at the &s;um|mit, a fine plain encompa&s;&s;ed with a &s;weep of fore&s;t. We could &s;ee the &s;un &s;hining there. The view in contra&s;t was quite charming.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time I &s;tood in this perplexed condition by the water-&s;ide, and could not tell what to do, when one of the lads came running to me, to let me know, that as he carefully examined the &s;ides of the glin we came down, he di&s;covered to the left, about four&s;core yards above the river, a pa&s;s wide enough for one hor&s;e to go through, and he believed it was a way out. This was reviving news, and upon going into it, I found that it went &s;traight on among the mountains, like a rent, or open crack, for three hundred yards, and then turned to the left for about fifty more, when it winded a little, and be|gan to extend wider and wider every yard, till it brought us by &s;everal turnings to the beginning of a fine valley, where we again found the river we had &s;een in the bottom of the deep glin, and perceived that it ended in a great water, and went off in &s;ome &s;ub|terranean way. The mountains were almo&s;t clo&s;e to this fine water, on either hand, for near half a mile, and made a delightful rural
<PB N="319" REF="334">&s;cene. We could &s;ee the river, as we looked up it, come tumbling on for a great way be|tween the &s;teep rocky precipices; and the broad bright lake it formed between va&s;t frowning mountains, with wood and lawns in it, at the end of the vale, were altogether a view mo&s;t charming. This made me more highly value <HI>Orton-Lodge.</HI></P>

<P>The gentlemen I was talking to, &s;eemed to wonder very much at me and my di&s;|cour&s;e; and as the re&s;t of the &s;ociety by this time came into the parlour, they introduced me to them, and then related what I had

<P>The philo&s;ophers wondered not a little at what they heard. If they were &s;urprized at &s;eeing me as a traveller in &s;uch a place, they were much more a&s;toni&s;hed at my relation.

The gal|lant <HI>lou&s;e</HI> did with a frown for &s;ome time be|hold him, and then crouching down, began very &s;oftly to move towards him, when the flea gave a leap on his enemy, and with his dangerous tail and pinching mouth, began the battle with great fury: but the lou&s;e &s;oon made him quit his hold, by hurting him with his claws, and wounding him with his &s;harp &s;nout. This made the flea &s;kip to the other &s;ide of the box, and they both kept at a di&s;tance for near a minute, looking with great indignation at each other, and offering &s;everal times to advance. The lou&s;e did it at la&s;t in a race, and then the flea flew at him, which produced a battle as terrible as
<PB N="339" REF="354">ever was fought by two wild bea&s;ts. Every part of their bodies were in mo&s;t violent mo|tion, and &s;ometimes the flea was uppermo&s;t, but more frequently the lou&s;e.

Among the books, I &s;aw the editions of the old authors, by the famous printers of the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries; editions greatly prized and &s;ought after by mo&s;t of the learned; but the&s;e gentlemen did not value them &s;o much as the editions of the cla&s;&s;icks, that have been publi&s;hed within this la&s;t century; e&s;pecially the quarto edi|tions done in Holland.

<P>In this fine &s;ermon, the Dr. gave us the picture of a man as like <HI>Charles the</HI> 1&s;t. as <HI>Phalaris</HI> was to the apo|&s;tle <HI>St John:</HI> he then deprecated the murder, (which are his own words), and in the mo&s;t piteous manner, with tears informed us, that God gave us this prince in his mercy, and took him away in his indignation: A Prince: (&s;ays the doctor), who was <HI>a true lover of his people, compa&s;&s;ionate of their errors and mis|fortunes,</HI> and <HI>religiou&s;ly tender of their well-being. He equally under&s;tood and practi&s;ed religion in its purity; and he died defending it.

<P>This advice, by the way, appeared to me very &s;in|gular, and I think, on the contrary, that it would be


<PB N="347" REF="362">


well for our church, if our bi&s;hops were obliged to leave the court, the parliament, and their politicks, and then &s;pend their lives in labouring in the vineyard of Chri&s;t, in their &s;everal dioce&s;es. What have prie&s;ts to do with baronies and acts of &s;tate; men that ought above all other men to be content with food and raiment, and to withdraw them&s;elves from the world, that by their con|tinued conver&s;ation with God, and attention only to the &s;acred pre&s;criptions of the go&s;pel, they might appear repleni&s;hed with that divine power and virtue, which by prayer, and all the exerci&s;es of piety and penitence, they had implored; and by their examples and in&s;truc|tions, brighten and inflame the people with the love of God, and improve the good in goodne&s;s, and correct and reform the wicked. This would be acting like bi&s;hops indeed. The holine&s;s of our prelates lives, and their fervor in teaching mankind the truths of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, would &s;oon advance the cau&s;e of their ma&s;ter. They would bring the people to conform to the will of the Lord, and cau&s;e the learned to purifie the defile|ments of genius; that pride and vanity, that curio&s;ity and &s;elf-love which are incompatible with an accompli&s;hed purity of heart. But as to <HI>Charles the Fir&s;t</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed memory, certain I am, that whatever Dean Delany may think of him, this prince did really contend for the cardinal maxims of the civil law, and died, not for true religion, (as this doctor &s;ays) but to advance the civil laws above the con&s;titution and laws of Britain, and thereby acquire an ab&s;olute dominion. <HI>Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem.</HI> It appears from matters of fact, that his <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> was to be the <HI>law.</HI> In him was to re&s;ide the &s;ole power of impo&s;ing taxes on the people. <HI>This power,</HI> and other powers contrary to the funda|mental form of this government; this king of ble&s;&s;ed

memory a&s;&s;umed and challenged as rights, under the name of his undoubted prerogatives, and gra&s;ped the pretence &s;o hard, as never to part with it, till he wanted &s;trength to hold it. This is the <HI>martyr.</HI> His reign was a pro|voking violation of parliamentary rights, and a cruel oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In&s;tead then of the fine laboured rea&s;ons offered by Dr. Delaney to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, to account for the way of providence in the tragical death of this king, he might have &s;aid &mdash; That whereas this prince had <HI>departed</HI> from the known laws of the land to an <HI>ar|bitrary</HI> power, and not only the <HI>pre&s;&s;ures</HI> and <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of the people, under this method of governing, were innumerable; but the <HI>fundamental form</HI> and <HI>original con&s;titution</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> (on which the prote&s;tant religion and the liberty of Europe depend) was in danger of be|ing &s;ubverted, and for ever de&s;troyed, therefore did Providence deliver up this king into the hands of wicked men, who had u&s;urped the admini&s;tration of affairs, that the mortification in the con&s;titution might be cured by the death of this de&s;troying prince; and the violence of his exit remain a monument in terrorem to all future kings of England; to have a care how they offer to make any alteration or change in the original form of government; for <HI>violations</HI> of the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> had brought <HI>Charles the Fir&s;t</HI> to the <HI>block.</HI> This had been a rea&s;onable account of that &s;ad affair.

<P>N. B. The contentions between his Maje&s;ty and the <HI>hou&s;e of commons</HI> began about the following <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> points. &mdash;

I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to &s;ay, that &s;ince <HI>Charles</HI> would not act for the protection, happine&s;s, and &s;afety of his people, but by a continued exertion of <HI>&s;overeign power,</HI> endeavored to oppre&s;s and ruin them, and change the form of government, his arbitrary principles brought him to a di&s;mal extremity.

So Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> &s;ays in his general hi&s;tory of the air; and &s;o I have often found it in my de&s;cents to the deepe&s;t mines. &mdash; As you plea&s;e then; (the gentlemen re|plied): you &s;hall have every thing you can de&s;ire, and be let down very &s;afely, however you may fare when you get to the ground: and when you want to come up, pull the packthread you have in your hand, that will be tied to a bell at the top of the tunnel, and you &s;hall be immediately drawn up again. The&s;e things being agreed, they let me down in a proper ba&s;ket the next morning at eight o'clock, with a lighted torch in my hand, and &s;oon after my man <HI>Ralph</HI> followed with every thing I had required. I was more than half an hour going down, for the rope was given like a jack line from the engine it came from. I &s;aw &s;everal di&s;mal lateral holes by the way; but no mi&s;chief or inconvenience did I meet with in my pa&s;&s;age to the ground.</P>
<P>When I came to the bottom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1725. June 20. 8th day from my leaving Jack Price's.</NOTE> I found I was in a chamber of a great extent, and tho' 103 yards from the day, breathed as free as if I had been above ground. A little river made a noi&s;e in its fall from a high rock, within four yards of the &s;pot I landed on, and ran with impetuo&s;ity in a rough channel I knew not where. The water was not deep, as we found with our poles, and but three yards broad, and there|fore
<PB N="366" REF="381">we cro&s;&s;ed it, at 100 yards from the fall, to get into a cavern that had an arched en|trance, on the other &s;ide, within two yards of the &s;tream. Our cour&s;e to the cro&s;&s;ing was due we&s;t, and then we went to the north, on pa&s;&s;ing the water, and walking up the &s;econd cave.</P>
<P>In it we a&s;cended for 79 yards, an ea&s;y ri&s;ing way, and then came to a &s;wallow, in|to which a river that ran towards us fell. Our cour&s;e to this place was due north, but as the flood came from the we&s;t, we turned next to that point, and by the &s;ide of this water marched 50 yards. The cavern was &s;o wide we could not &s;ee the walls, and the roof was of a va&s;t height.</P>
<P>At the end of the 50 yards, the river ap|peared due north again, and by its &s;ide we went for 10 more, till we came to another va&s;t cavern, that was a &s;teep a&s;cending open|ing, down which the river very mu&s;ically came. This place was &s;o like <HI>Pool's-hole,</HI> that I might think my&s;elf in the <HI>Peak.</HI> It was ju&s;t &s;uch another grand opening, up the in&s;ide of a mountain, and had not only the de&s;cending flood, but as many beautiful <HI>&s;talactical concretions</HI> on the ri&s;ing way; which formed the mo&s;t beautiful pillars, walls, and figures of the fine&s;t carved work; but in this it differed from <HI>Pools-hole,</HI> that the a&s;|cending
<PB N="367" REF="382">opening in <HI>Richmond&s;hire</HI> is much wider; the rough, open &s;teep, much higher to the roof; and this &s;teep reaches to the &s;ummit of the va&s;t hills, and ends in an opening in day. We came out this way on the top of an exceeding high mountain, after we had climbed from the bottom to the upper end 479 yards 

<NOTE N="(34)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Pools-hole,</HI> a little mile we&s;t of <HI>Buxton-wells</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> is in the whole length, from the entrance to the farthe&s;t a&s;cent, but 230 yards. The account of this in <HI>Camden</HI> is very imperfect, and next to nothing: and what the authors of the <HI>Tour through Great-Britain</HI> &s;ay of it, even in their 5th edition, in the year 1753, only &s;hews to one who has been there, and carefully examined it, that neither <HI>Daniel Defoe,</HI> nor tho&s;e &s;ince concerned in improving and correcting the four volumes of the Tour, ever were in the in&s;ide of <HI>Pool's-hole.</HI> Their de&s;cription of this, like a thou&s;and other places in tho&s;e volumes, is mere imagination (with &s;ome things from Cotton's fal&s;e account) and the fancy not only wrong, but very bad.&mdash;I would de&s;cribe it here, but that the reader will find me in <HI>Derby&s;hire</HI> before I take my leave of him, if death does not prevent, and I &s;hall then give a full and true hi&s;tory of this high and rough country; its waters, curio&s;ities, and antiquities: &mdash; At pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, to abate the wonder of my pa&s;&s;ing from the bottom of the in&s;ide of one of the Richmond mountains to the plain on the top of it, that

the hill in which is <HI>Pool's-hole</HI> is open within &s;ide, in the a&s;cent, &s;o far, that 5 yards more of aperture would bring one to the out&s;ide of the top: and I believe it is very po&s;&s;ible for art to make an entrance that way, as nature has done at the bottom.</P><PB N="367" REF="382"></NOTE>


: add to this 229 yards, the way we had come from the bot|tom of the tunnel to the beginning of the watery &s;teep, and our march through the
<PB N="368" REF="383">mountain, from the time we parted with the gentlemen, to our getting out at the top of it, was 708 yards.</P>
<P>This was a laborious route, and at the ha|zard of our lives, many times, performed. Once, in particular, my lad <HI>Ralph</HI> fell into the river with his torch in the great a&s;cent, and in &s;triving to &s;ave his life, I lo&s;t the other light I carried in my hand. This reduced us to a &s;tate of the blacke&s;t darkne&s;s, and in that condition, we could not &s;tir. It was a horrible &s;cene. It chilled my blood, and curdled it in my veins: but I had a tinder-box, matches, and wax-candle, in my pocket, and &s;oon recovered the de&s;ir|able light; at which we lit other torches, and proceeded to a&s;cend the rough and rocky &s;teep, till we came to the fountain that made the de&s;cending flood. The opening upwards from that became very narrow, and the &s;lant &s;o great, that it was extremely difficult to go on; but as I could &s;ee the day at the end of it, I re&s;olved to &s;trive hard, and mount, if po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e remaining 60 yards. In &s;hort, we did the work. As before related, we
<PB N="369" REF="384">came out this way, and from the di&s;mal ca|verns of night a&s;cended to a delightful plain; from which we again beheld the glorious &s;un, and had the fine&s;t points of view. It was by this time noon, and under the &s;hade of &s;ome aged trees, that grew on the banks of a great lake, on the &s;ummit of this va&s;t hill, I &s;at down to &s;ome bread and wine I had brought with me for relief. Never was repa&s;t more &s;weet. I was not only fa|tigued very much; but, had been in fear as to my ever climbing up, and knew not how to get down, when I had mounted two thirds of the way. The de&s;cent was a thou&s;and times more dangerous than the going to|wards the top.</P>

<HEAD>72. We de|&s;cended from the top of the mountain, we had travelled through, and arrive at Mr. Har|court's hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P> When I had done, I walked about to &s;ee if there was any way down the moun|tain's &s;ides, to go to <HI>Ulubrae,</HI> from whence I came; but for miles it was a frightful per|pendicular rock, next that place, and im|po&s;&s;ible for a goat to de&s;cend; and on the &s;ide that faced Bi&s;hoprick, and a fine country hou&s;e and gardens, about a quarter of a mile off, in a delightful valley, that extended with all the beauties of wood and lawn, meadow and water, from the foot of the mountain I was on, the precipice here was a terrible way for a man to venture down; but it was po&s;&s;ible to do it with a long pole, at
<PB N="370" REF="385">the hazard of his life, as the rocks projected in many places, and the &s;ide went &s;loping off; and therefore I re&s;olved to de&s;cend. I could not think of going back the way I came; &s;ince I had got &s;afe into day again, I thought it better to ri&s;k my limbs in the face of the &s;un, than peri&s;h as I might do in the black and di&s;mal in&s;ide of tho&s;e tremendous hills. Be&s;ides, the hou&s;e in my view, might be perhaps the one I wanted. It was po&s;&s;ible my friend <HI>Turner</HI> might live there.</P>
<P>With art and caution then I began to de|&s;cend, and &s;o happily took every offered ad|vantage of jutting rock and path in my way, that without any accident I got in &s;afety down; tho' the perils were &s;o great, that often I could not reach from rock to rock with my pole. In this ca&s;e, I aimed the point of my pole at the &s;pot I intended to light on, and clapped my feet clo&s;e to it, when I went off in the air from the rock: the pole coming fir&s;t to the place broke the fall, and then &s;liding gently down by it, I pitched on the &s;pot I de&s;igned to go to, though &s;ix, &s;even, or eight fathom off, and the part of the rock below not more than a yard broad. It is a frightful piece of activity to a by|&s;tander; but the youths on the moun|tains of Ireland make nothing of it: they are as expert at this work as the <HI>Teneriff</HI>
<PB N="371" REF="386">men: from them I learned it; and made <HI>Ralph</HI> &s;o perfect in the action, while he tra|velled with me, that he could go from rock to rock like a bird.</P>
<P><LABEL>My recep|tion at Mr. Harcourt's hou&s;e.</LABEL> When we came to the ground,  I &s;ent my man before me to the hou&s;e, with my hum|ble &s;ervice to Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> the ma&s;ter of it, and to let him know, that I had travelled through the in&s;ide of one of the high moun|tains that &s;urrounded his hou&s;e, and on com|ing out of the top of it, had made the preci|pice next him my road to the valley he lived in; that I knew not which way to turn next, in order to go to <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and begged leave to dine with him and receive his information. &mdash; This &s;trange me&s;&s;age, delivered by <HI>Ralph</HI> with much comic gra|vity, that gentleman could not tell what to make of; as I had ordered my young man not to explain him&s;elf, but &s;till &s;ay, that we had travelled the in&s;ide of the mountain, and came down the precipice. This was &s;o &s;ur|prizing a thing to Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> and his daughter, that they walked out with &s;ome impatience to &s;ee this extraordinary traveller, and expre&s;&s;ed no little amazement, when they came near me. After a &s;alute, Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> told me he did not under&s;tand what my &s;ervant had &s;aid to him; nor could he comprehend how I arrived in this valley, as there was but one pa&s;&s;age into it at the front
<PB N="372" REF="387">of his hou&s;e; and my being on foot too, en|crea&s;ed the wonder of my appearing in the place: but whatever way I came, I was wel|come to his hou&s;e, and he would &s;hew me the way in.</P>
<P>My arrival here, Sir, (I replied) is to be &s;ure very &s;trange, and would be almo&s;t in|credible to hear told by another per&s;on, of one that journeyed 229 yards deep, to the foundation of this Alp, on the other &s;ide of it, then a&s;cended a hollow way, till he got out at the top, and came down a high and frightful precipice to the vale below: But here I am a proof of the fact. I will ex|plain how it was done; and I began to re|late every particular at large.</P>
<P>But tell me, Sir, (Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> &s;aid) if you plea&s;e, why did you not return the way you came; &s;ince the other &s;ide of the moun|tain is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cend, as you inform us, on account of its being a perpendicular &s;teep; and that you mu&s;t have hazarded your life a thou&s;and times, in coming down the way you did with the pole? I tremble as I look at the place, and only with fancy's eye, &s;ee you on the de&s;cent. Be&s;ide, the gentlemen you left on the other &s;ide of the hill, will conclude you lo&s;t, and be very greatly troubled on the account.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on, Madam, (I an&s;wering, &s;aid) for coming down this very dangerous way,
<PB N="373" REF="388">was, becau&s;e I thought it, with all its perils, much &s;afer than the in&s;ide road I had come. My activity, I had rea&s;on to think, was &s;u|perior to the difficulties of the outward way, and if I &s;hould fall, it would be in the light of heaven, with a human habitation in view, that might afford me &s;ome relief, if I only broke my bones; but, if in de&s;cending the very &s;teep and horrible caverns of the hill, which with the greate&s;t difficulty I climbed up, I &s;hould happen to get a fall, as in all human probability I would, and break a limb in the&s;e mo&s;t di&s;mal cavities of eternal night, I mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the mo&s;t mi&s;er|able manner, without a po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining any relief. Nor is this all, madam. The thing that brought me here among the mountains of Richmond&s;hire, was to find a gentleman of my acquaintance, and when I &s;aw your hou&s;e from the top of the mountain, I did not know but it might be his. I fan&s;ied it was, as the &s;ituation an&s;wered my friend's de&s;cription of the &s;pot he lived on.</P>
<P>And if it had been his, madam, it would have put an end to all my toils; for I am a wanderer upon the face of the earth, through the cruelty of a mother-in-law; and the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of a rich father; who has for|&s;aken me, becau&s;e I will not &s;ubmit to the declarations and deci&s;ions of weak and fal|lible men, in matters of pure revelation and
<PB N="374" REF="389">divine faith, and own the infallibility of the orthodox &s;y&s;tem. Becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ent of my mind could not go beyond the perception of my under&s;tanding, and I would not allow that the popular confe&s;&s;ion is the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, therefore I was thrown off, and obliged to become the pilgrim you &s;ee before you.</P>
<P>This hi&s;tory of a forlorn &s;eemed &s;tranger to the young lady and her father than even the account of my journey through the in|&s;ide of a mountain, and down a precipice that a goat would &s;carce venture. They were both very greatly amazed at my relation, and Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> was going to a&s;k me &s;ome que&s;|tions, when one of his &s;ervants came to let him know that dinner was &s;erving up, and by this put an end to our conver&s;ation. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e brought me into a fine room, and I &s;aw on the table an elegant dinner: there was likewi&s;e a grand &s;ideboard, and &s;e|veral men &s;ervants attending: mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> &s;at at the head of the table, and at her right hand two young ladies, va&s;tly hand&s;ome, whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention here|after in this journal: two ladies more were on the other &s;ide of her, pretty women, but no beauties; and next them &s;at three gentle|men; &s;en&s;ible, well-behaved men; one of them a ma&s;ter of mu&s;ick, the other a ma&s;ter
<PB N="375" REF="390">languages, and the third a great painter; who were kept in the hou&s;e on large &s;alaries, to teach the young lady the&s;e things: Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> placed me by him&s;elf, and was not only ex|tremely civil, but manife&s;ted a kind of fond|ne&s;s as if he was well plea&s;ed with my arri|val. He and his daughter took great care of me, and treated me as if I had been a man of di&s;tinction rather than the poor pil|grim they &s;aw me, with my &s;taff in my hand. The young lady talked to me in a very plea&s;ant manner, and as I &s;aw the whole company were inclined to be very chearful, I clubbed as much as I could to promote good-humour, and encrea&s;e the fe&s;tivity of the table. We laughed the afternoon away in a charming manner, and when we had done, we all went to walk in the gardens. Here the company &s;oon &s;eparated, as the various beauties of the place inclined various minds to different things and parts. Some, pen&s;ive roamed in &s;hady walks; &s;ome &s;at by playing fountains; and others went to gather fruits and flowers. I had the honour to walk with Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> to a canal at &s;ome di&s;tance, and as we went, this young lady told me, &s;he did not well under&s;tand me as to what I had &s;aid of religion being concerned in my becoming a traveller, and de&s;ired me to be a little more particular. That I will,
<PB N="376" REF="391">and immediately proceeded in the following manner.</P>

<HEAD>73. A di&s;cour&s;e with mi&s;s Harcourt in relation to my re|ligion.</HEAD>
<P> My father, madam, is a man of great learning, virtue and knowledge, but <HI>ortho|dox</HI> to the la&s;t degree, and &s;ent me to the univer&s;ity on purpo&s;e to make me a <HI>theologer,</HI> that I might be an able defender of the <HI>Creed of St. Athana&s;ius,</HI> and convince the poor people of the country he lived in, and in good time (he fondly hoped) the inhabitants of many other countries; that notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;ymbol I have mentioned is what no human apprehen&s;ion can comprehend, and the <HI>judgment</HI> hath nothing to act on in the con&s;ideration of it;&mdash;that there is nothing to be under&s;tood in that &s;ymbol, nor can a man form any determination of the matter therein contained; &mdash; yet they mu&s;t <HI>believe</HI> this <HI>great</HI> and <HI>awful my&s;tery:</HI> that three per|&s;ons and Gods are only one per&s;on and God; and, on <HI>peril of eternal mi&s;ery,</HI> they mu&s;t confe&s;s that, <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> tho' <HI>three Beings, as di&s;tinct as any three things in the univer&s;e,</HI> yet are only <HI>one Being.</HI> This my&s;tery I was to preach up in his church, (a church in a field, near his hou&s;e, to which he had the right of pre&s;enting,) and enflame the people again&s;t <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> that trai|tor to God and religion, which our adver|&s;aries, the Chri&s;tian dei&s;ts, would make Lord and King in oppo&s;ition to <HI>faith.</HI> I
<PB N="377" REF="392">was to tell my beloved, that rea&s;on is a car|nal &s;en&s;ual devil, and that in&s;tead of heark|ening to this tempter, they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e heavenly propo&s;itions, which give wi&s;|dom without ideas, and certainty without knowledge. You mu&s;t believe, my beloved, that none is before or after the other. &mdash; None is greater or le&s;s than another. The infidels call this an unintelligible <HI>piece of non|&s;en&s;e:</HI> but it is, my beloved, <HI>a very tran|&s;cendent my&s;tery.</HI> It does, we mu&s;t own, <HI>&s;tagger</HI> and <HI>a&s;toni&s;h</HI> us, being a thing beyond our reach to comprehend; but, it mu&s;t be believed, on peril of eternal mi&s;ery, as I be|fore ob&s;erved: and it is ea&s;y to be believed, for this <HI>plain rea&s;on,</HI> (given by a very learned and pious bi&s;hop of our church) to wit, that <HI>it is too high to be by us comprehended.</HI> This was the opinion of that great prelate, Dr. <HI>Beveridge,</HI> in his <HI>Private Thoughts,</HI> p. 52. to which book I refer you, my beloved, for more of his admirable rea&s;oning on this ca|pital article, and farther ob&s;erve to you, that not only this mo&s;t pious bi&s;hop, and many other mo&s;t excellent prelates were of this way of thinking; but all the mo&s;t admirable divines have declared in their &s;ermons, and other matchle&s;s writings, that the <HI>more incre|dible</HI> the <HI>Athana&s;ian creed</HI> is, and the <HI>fuller of contradictions,</HI> the more honour we do to our God in believing it. It is the glory of <HI>orthodox Chri&s;tians,</HI> that their <HI>faith</HI> is not
<PB N="378" REF="393">only contrary to the carnal mind, but even to the <HI>mo&s;t exalted rea&s;on.</HI> In matters of faith, we mu&s;t renounce our rea&s;on, even tho' it be the only thing that di&s;tingui&s;hes us from the bea&s;ts, and makes us capable of any religion at all. No human arguments are to interfere in this victorious principle: the <HI>catholic faith</HI> is the rever&s;e of rational re|ligion, and except a man believe it faith|fully, he mu&s;t go into everla&s;ting fire and brim&s;tone 

<NOTE N="(35)" PLACE="foot"><P>Little did I think when I talked in &s;uch a man|ner to Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> again&s;t the <HI>famous &s;ymbol,</HI> that I &s;hould ever find in the book of a mo&s;t learned man an excellent divine, the &s;ame kind of arguments &s;eriou&s;ly produced in favor of the Creed of St. Athana&s;ius: yet this &s;trange thing has time brought on, and thereby con|vinced the world, that the greate&s;t <HI>learning</HI> and the mo&s;t exalted <HI>piety,</HI> employed in the cau&s;e of <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> can be|come &s;o <HI>extravagant</HI> and <HI>erring</HI> as to mentain that a thing <HI>incomprehen&s;ible to human rea&s;on,</HI> can be <HI>revealed,</HI> and that <HI>the more incomprehen&s;ible</HI> it is to human rea&s;on, and the more &s;en&s;ele&s;s it appears to human under&s;tand|ing, the more glorious is the object of faith, and the more worthy to be believed by a chri&s;tian.

.</P>
<P>In this manner, madam, like a <HI>mad bigot,</HI> a <HI>flaming zealot,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ublime believer,</HI> was I to preach to the people of Ireland, and be
<PB N="379" REF="394">an apo&s;tle for that faith which is an obedi|ence to unrea&s;onable commands: but <HI>un|fortunately,</HI> for my father's de&s;ign; and <HI>for|tunately,</HI> for my &s;oul; I was, on entring the univer&s;ity, put into the hands of a gentle|man, who abhorred <HI>modern orthodoxy,</HI> and made the e&s;&s;ential con&s;titutive happine&s;s and perfection of every intelligent being con&s;i&s;t in the conformity of our mind to the moral rectitude of the Divine Nature. This ex|cellent man convinced my under&s;tanding, that even faith in Chri&s;t is of an inferior na|ture to this: it is only the means to obtain it. Such a conformity and obedience of the heart and con&s;cience to the will of God ought to be my religion, as it was the religion of our Saviour him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus, madam, was I in&s;tructed by a ma&s;|ter of arts, my private tutor, and when to his le&s;&s;ons I added my own careful exami|nations of the <HI>vulgar faith,</HI> and the mind of our Lord as I found it in the <HI>books,</HI> I was thoroughly &s;atisfied, that an act of faith is an act of rea&s;on, and an act of rea&s;on an act of faith, in religious matters; &mdash; that our Lord was not the great God; nor a part of that <HI>compound,</HI> called the <HI>Triune-God;</HI> the mi&s;erable invention of divines; but, a more extraordinary me&s;&s;enger than the prophets under the law, cho&s;en by the divine wi&s;dom, to publi&s;h the will of God to mankind, and &s;ent under the character of <HI>his &s;on,</HI> and <HI>&s;pi|ritual

<PB N="382" REF="397"><HI>unexceptionably</HI> clear, &mdash; that there is <HI>One Supreme Independent Fir&s;t-Cau&s;e of all things, a Spirit,</HI> that is, <HI>One Spirit, One God: I am God, and there is none like me: I am God,</HI> and <HI>there is none el&s;e; be&s;ide Me; with Me; none but Me.</HI> &mdash; Thus does the Holy Gho&s;t declare; and what &s;ignify the de&s;pi|cable, heretical declarations of the doctors, in re&s;pect of this?</P>

<P>This di&s;cour&s;e, delivered with my fire and action, amazed Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> &s;o greatly, that for &s;ome time after I had done, &s;he could not &s;peak, but continued looking with great earne&s;tne&s;s at me. At la&s;t however &s;he &s;aid, I am glad, Sir, it has been my fate to meet with you, and mu&s;t, when there is more time, conver&s;e with you on this &s;ub|ject.

<HEAD>74. Mr. Har|court's ob|&s;ervation on our di&s;|cour&s;e, and generous offer to me.</HEAD>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> came up to us,  and de&s;ired to know, (if it was a fair que&s;|tion) what we two had been talking &s;o ear|ne&s;tly on; for it &s;eemed at a di&s;tance to be &s;omething more than ordinary. I will tell you, Sir, his daughter replied, and imme|diately began to relate the whole conference, and her re&s;olution. Your re&s;olution (the father &s;aid) is excellent. You have not only my con&s;ent, but I recommend it to you as the noble&s;t work you can employ any time on. For my part, Sir, (Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> con|tinued, turning him&s;elf to me) I never liked this part of our prote&s;tant religion, and have often wi&s;hed our public prayers had been more conformable to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel; that we had been contented with what our Ma&s;ter and the Holy Spirit deli|vered, and not made human compo&s;itions the &s;tandard of &s;alvation: but &s;ince the church in her wi&s;dom has thought it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, I have &s;ubmitted to her authority, and been &s;ilent on the doctrines &s;he claims a right to determine; though &s;ome of them to me appear doubtful, and others repugnant to &s;cripture: be&s;ide, my &s;tudies have been in other fields than that of controver&s;y: mathe|matics and antiquities have employed my time, and I have neither ta&s;te nor capacity for that critici&s;m which is nece&s;&s;ary for the
<PB N="386" REF="401">examination of &s;uch points: greatly however do I honour tho&s;e who have the ability and patience to go through the work, as I mu&s;t own it is of the mo&s;t importance, and that the <HI>orthodox faith</HI> is a <HI>&s;ad thing,</HI> if the truth be, after all our Athana&s;ian believing, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is no more than <HI>God's in&s;trument,</HI> as St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> name him; a <HI>&s;ucce&s;|ful teacher</HI> of <HI>wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifi|cation,</HI> and <HI>redemption:</HI> and that God is to be <HI>owned</HI> and <HI>prai&s;ed,</HI> as the <HI>true, chief,</HI> and <HI>original cau&s;e</HI> of all <HI>&s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, accord|ing to the coun&s;el of his own will, his own good plea&s;ure, purpo&s;e,</HI> etc. without <HI>partner</HI> or <HI>&s;e|cond per&s;on,</HI> to <HI>intreat</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfy</HI> for us. If this be the ca&s;e, may the Lord have mercy on our poor orthodox &s;ouls: and as it may be &s;o, I honour you for enquiring into the matter, and e&s;pecially for your good Spirit in prefering the things that are eternal, when what you thought truth could not be held with things temporal. I have (Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> continued) a very great e&s;teem for you on this account, and if I can be of &s;er|vice to you, I will. He imagined I might want money, and if I did, he would lend me a hundred guineas, without intere&s;t, pay|able on my note of hand, when I could. He immediately took out of his pocket-book a bank note for that &s;um, and pre&s;&s;ed me to
<PB N="387" REF="402">accept it. He likewi&s;e invited me to &s;tay at his hou&s;e, while he continued in the coun|try, which would be for a month longer. He a&s;&s;ured me al&s;o, that I might make it my re&s;idence after he left it, if I plea&s;ed: there would be two &s;ervants to attend me, and there was excellent mutton, and other things, for my table. Nor is this all; you &s;hall have the key of my &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The&s;e offers a&s;toni&s;hed me, and I &s;aid, mo&s;t generous Sir, I return you the thanks of a grateful heart, and will ever remember your goodne&s;s to me with that &s;en&s;e &s;uch un|common kindne&s;s de&s;erves, tho' I cannot en|joy the benefits you would make me happy with. As to money, I do not want any yet, and when I do, it will be time enough for me to borrow, if I &s;hould find any one, like you, &s;o benevolently di&s;po&s;ed as to lend me ca&s;h without &s;ecurity and intere&s;t: and as to &s;taying at your hou&s;e, that offer I cannot accept, as I am engaged to a near and rich friend, who will be to me a &s;ubaltern provi|dence, if he can be found, and &s;ecure me from the evils my attachment to truth has expo&s;ed me to. One week however I will &s;tay with you, &s;ince you are &s;o good as to invite me in this kind manner.</P>
<P>Here then I &s;tayed a week, and pa&s;&s;ed it in a mo&s;t happy way. Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> was
<PB N="388" REF="403">fond of me, and did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable. His lovely daughter was not only as civil as it was po&s;|&s;ible to be, but did me the honour to com|mence a friend&s;hip with me, which la&s;ted from that time till death de&s;troyed the gol|den thread that linked it.</P>

<HEAD>75. An account of Harriot Eu&s;ebia Harcourt.</HEAD>
<P> Reader, this young lady, <HI>Harriot Eu&s;ebia Harcourt,</HI> was the foundre&s;s of a re|ligious hou&s;e of prote&s;tant reclu&s;es, who are &s;till a &s;ociety in that part of <HI>Richmond&s;hire</HI> where fir&s;t I &s;aw her and her father. They are under no vow, but while they plea&s;e to continue members, live as they do in nun|neries, and in piety, and in all the parts of the chri&s;tian temper, endeavour a re&s;em|blance of their divine Lord and Ma&s;ter; with this di&s;tinction however, that to the plan of the regards due from man by the divine Law to God, to his fellow-creatures, and to him|&s;elf, they add mu&s;ick and painting for their diver&s;ion, and unbend their minds in the&s;e delightful arts, for a few hours every day. This makes them excel in the&s;e particulars. They are great ma&s;ters in all kinds of mu|&s;ick, and do wonders with the pencil.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;ebia</HI> was but ju&s;t turned of twenty when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, in the year 1725, and then her mu&s;ical performances were admi|rable &mdash; her pictures had the ordonnance,
<PB N="389" REF="404">colouring, and expre&s;&s;ion of a great ma&s;ter. She was born with a picture&s;que genius, and a capacity to give mea&s;ure and movement to compo&s;itions of harmony. Her mu&s;ic at the time I am &s;peaking of had a mo&s;t &s;urprizing power: and in painting, long before this time, &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed. When &s;he was a child, nine years old, and had no ma&s;ter, &s;he would &s;ketch with a black lead pencil on a &s;heet of paper the pictures of various kinds that came in her way, and make &s;uch imi|tations as de&s;erved the attention of judges. This made her father get her an eminent ma&s;ter, and &s;he had not been long under his direction, when &s;he was able to infu&s;e a &s;oul into her figures, and motion into her com|po&s;itions. She not only drew land&s;kips, and low &s;ubjects with a &s;ucce&s;s great as <HI>Teniers,</HI> but evinced by her paintings, that &s;he brought into the world with her an aptitude for works of a &s;uperior cla&s;s.

The maje&s;tic and godlike form which the apo&s;tle beheld is wonderfully painted. He is repre&s;ented with more than human ma|je&s;ty.

<P>But it was not only in painting,  and in mu&s;ick, that Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> excelled: &s;he had, when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, made great pro|gre&s;s in her &s;tudies, and di&s;covered in her conver&s;ation extraordinary abilities. She talked wi&s;ely and learnedly on many &s;ubjects, and in &s;o charming a manner, that &s;he entered into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and the ad|miration of all that heard her: nor was it only in pure Italian, Spani&s;h, and other lan|guages that &s;he could expre&s;s her notions; but, in he correcte&s;t Latin &s;he often &s;poke to me, and for an hour would di&s;cour&s;e in the Roman tongue, with as great ea&s;e as if &s;he had been talking Engli&s;h. She &s;poke it without any manner of difficulty, which was more than I could do. I was &s;low, and pau&s;ed &s;ometimes; but this young lady went on with that volubility of tongue the women are born with. The language being <HI>Latin</HI> was no check to her natural fluency of &s;peech.</P>
<P>To all this let me add, and with truth I can add it, that <HI>Eu&s;ebia,</HI> from the time I was fir&s;t acquainted with her to her death, walked in the fear of the Lord, and of con&s;equence, in the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t. Reli|gion

<P><LABEL>Her picture.</LABEL> Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt,</HI> at the time I am &s;peaking of, that is, in the one and twentieth year of her age, had all the qualities that con&s;titute a beauty: &s;he was tall and graceful, and in every action, and her whole behaviour, to the la&s;t degree charming: her eyes were va&s;tly fine, large and long, even with her face, black as night, and had a &s;parkling bright|ne&s;s as great as could appear from the refrac|tion of diamonds: her hair was as the po|li&s;hed jet, deep and glo&s;&s;y; and yet, her complexion fre&s;h as the glories of the &s;pring, and her lips like a beautiful flower.</P>
<P>This Lady was nine years abroad with her father, who died of the plague at Con&s;tanti|nople
<PB N="399" REF="414">in 1733, and in the cour&s;e of her tra|vels, did me the honour to write me many fine letters, in which &s;he obliged me with her remarks on the things and people they &s;aw in many countries.

The&s;e letters may perhaps appear &s;ome day.</P>
<P>In the year 34 Mrs. <HI>Harcourt</HI> returned to England, and brought over with her &s;ome ladies, who became con&s;tituents of her clau|&s;tral hou&s;e.

They were but twelve in number for &s;everal years, but, in the &s;ixth year of the <HI>In&s;tituto,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Harcourt</HI> en|crea&s;ed it to twenty-four members, by taking in twelve eleves or di&s;ciples.

Glorious women! to letters, arts, and piety, they devote tho&s;e hours which others wa&s;te in vanities the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s and de&s;picable; and pur&s;uant to the advice, and according to the rule drawn up by their illu&s;trious foundre&s;s, live as beings that have &s;ouls de&s;igned for eternity. They act continually upon a future pro&s;pect, and give all diligence in making con&s;tant advances toward the perfect day.

If there be a devil to a&s;&s;ault, a cor|rupt heart to oppo&s;e, and many difficulties to be encountred, yet her conduct was a de|mon&s;tration, that tho&s;e who are heirs of the heavenly country, may chu&s;e and pro|&s;ecute

<P>The twenty-fifth day of <HI>June</HI> I took my leave of Mi&s;s <HI>Harcourt</HI> and her father,  and the re&s;t of the good company, and on hor&s;es I borrowed, we returned to the philo&s;ophers at <HI>Ulubrae.</HI> It was nineteen miles round of mo&s;t terrible road; a great part of it being deep and &s;wampy bottom, with holes up to the hor&s;es &s;houlders in &s;ome places; and for &s;everal miles, we were o|bliged to ride on the &s;ides of very &s;teep and craggy mountains, in a path &s;o very narrow, that we ri&s;ked life, and pa&s;&s;ed in terror: a wrong &s;tep would have been de&s;truction be|yond

It was likewi&s;e no &s;mall perplexity to find, that I was going back again, the cour&s;e being &s;outh and &s;outh|we&s;t; and that there was no other way of journeying from Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s to <HI>Ulubrae,</HI> but through the pa&s;s I fir&s;t travelled from <HI>We&s;tmorland;</HI> unle&s;s I rid from Mr. <HI>Har|court</HI>'s into <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and then round through <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> to the valley the gen|tlemen lived in. On then I went at all hazards, and in a tedious manner was forced to creep the way: but to make &s;ome amends, the pro&s;pects from the hills were fine, and things very curious occurred. Groupes of cre&s;ts of mountains appeared here and there, like large cities with towers and old Gothick edifices, and from caverns in their &s;ides torrents of water &s;treamed out, and tumbled in various cour&s;es to the mo&s;t delightful vales below. In &s;ome of the va&s;t hills there were openings quite through, &s;o as to &s;ee the &s;un, at the end of three or four thou&s;and yards; and in many of them were &s;loping caverns, very wonderful to behold.</P>

<HEAD>79. A fine chamber in a moun|tain, and a pa&s;&s;age from the room to a valley on the other &s;ide of the va&s;t preci|pice.</HEAD>
<P> I found in one of them, near the top of a very high mountain, a de&s;cent like &s;teps of &s;tairs, that was in breadth and height like the i&s;le of a church, for 300 yards, and then ended at a kind of door, or &s;mall arched opening, that was high enough
<PB N="403" REF="418">for a tall man to walk into a grand room which it led to. This chamber was a &s;quare of 17 yards, and had an arched roof about 20 high. The &s;tone of it was a green marble, not earthy and opake, but pure and cry&s;talline, which made it appear very beautiful, as the walls were as &s;mooth as if the be&s;t poli&s;h had made them &s;o. There was another opening or door at the other &s;ide of this chamber, and from it likewi&s;e went a de&s;cent like &s;teps, but the down|ward pa&s;&s;age here was much &s;teeper than the other I had come to, and the opening not more than one third as wide and high; nar|rowing gradually to the bottom of the &s;loping road, till it ended in a round hole, a yard and a quarter every way. I could &s;ee the day at the opening below, tho' it &s;eemed at a great di&s;tance from me, and as it was not dangerous to de&s;cend, I determined to go down.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent was 479 yards in a &s;traight line, and opened in a view of meadows, &s;cattered trees, and &s;treams, that were en|chantingly fine. There appeared to be about four and twenty acres of fine land, quite &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t frightful precipices in the world, and in the center of it a neat and pretty little country hou&s;e, on an ea&s;y ri&s;ing ground. I could di&s;cover with my long
<PB N="404" REF="419">gla&s;s a young and hand&s;ome woman &s;itting at the door, engaged in needle-work of &s;ome kind; and on the margin of a brook hard by, another charmer &s;tood, angling for fi&s;h of &s;ome &s;ort: a garden appeared near the man&s;ion that was well improved; and in the fields were &s;heep and goats, hor&s;es, and cows: cocks and hens, ducks and gee&s;e, were walking about the ground; and I could perceive a college of bees. The whole formed a charming &s;cene.</P>

<HEAD>80. An account of the inha|bitants of the valley I came into.</HEAD>
<P> Plea&s;ed with the view, and impatient to know who the two charmers were, I quite forgot the poor &s;ituation in which I left <HI>Tim,</HI> holding the hor&s;es at the mouth of the cavern, on the dangerous &s;ide of &s;o high a hill, and proceeded immediately to the hou&s;e, as &s;oon as I had recovered my&s;elf from a fall. My foot &s;lipt in the pa&s;&s;age, about &s;ix yards from the day, and I came rolling out of the mountain in a violent and &s;urprizing manner. It was ju&s;t mid-day when I came up to the ladies, and as they did not &s;ee me till they chanced to turn round, they were &s;o amazed at my appearing, they changed colour, and one of them &s;hrieked aloud; but this fright was &s;oon over, on my a&s;&s;uring them that I was their mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, and had again&s;t my will tumbled out of the hole that was at the bottom of that va&s;t mountain before them. This I explained,
<PB N="405" REF="420">and prote&s;ted that I had not a thought of paying them a vi&s;it, when curio&s;ity led me into an opening near the top of the hill, as I was travelling on; but that when I did get through &s;o wonderful a pa&s;&s;age, and &s;aw what was &s;till more &s;trange, when I arrived in the vale, to wit, two ladies, in &s;o wild and &s;ilent a place, I judged it my duty to pay my re&s;pects, and a&s;k if you had any commands that I could execute in the world? This was polite, they &s;aid, and gave me thanks; but told me, they had no favor to a&s;k than that I would dine with them, and inform them how it happened that I was obliged to travel over the&s;e &s;carce pa&s;&s;able mountains, where there was no &s;ociety nor &s;upport to be had. Be&s;ide, if in riding here, you &s;hould receive a mi&s;chief, there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of getting any relief. There mu&s;t be &s;omething very extraordinary &s;urely, that could cau&s;e you to journey over &s;uch frightful hills, and through the deep bottoms at the foot of them.</P>
<P>Ladies (I replied), nece&s;&s;ity and curio&s;ity united are the &s;pring that move me over the&s;e mountains, and enable me to bear the hard&s;hips I meet with in the&s;e ways. Forced from home by the cruelties of a &s;tep-mother, and for&s;aken by my father on her account, I am wandering about the precipices of Rich|mond&s;hire in &s;earch of a gentleman, my Friend; to who&s;e ho&s;pitable hou&s;e and gene|rous
<PB N="406" REF="421">brea&s;t I &s;hould be welcome, if I could find out where he lives in &s;ome part of this remote and de&s;olate region: and as my cu|rio&s;ity is more than ordinary, and I love to contemplate the works of nature, which are very grand and a&s;toni&s;hing in this part of the world, I have gone many a mile out of my way while I have been looking for &s;everal days pa&s;t for my friend, and have ventured into places where very few I believe would go. It was this ta&s;te for natural knowledge that travelled me down the in&s;ide of the mountain I am ju&s;t come out of. If I had not had it, I &s;hould never have known there was &s;o delightful a little country here as what I now &s;ee: nor &s;hould I have had the honor and happine&s;s of being known to you.</P>
<P>But tell me, Sir, (one of the&s;e beauties &s;aid) how have you lived for &s;everal days among the&s;e rocks and de&s;art places, as there are no inns in this country, nor a hou&s;e, ex|cept this here, that we know? are you the favorite of the fairies and genies &mdash; or does the wi&s;e man of the hills bring you every night in a cloud to his home?</P>
<P>It looks &s;omething like it, madam, (I an&s;wering &s;aid) and the thing to be &s;ure mu&s;t appear very &s;trange: but it is like other &s;trange things: when the nature of them is known, they appear ea&s;y and plain. This
<PB N="407" REF="422">country I find con&s;i&s;ts, for the mo&s;t part, of ranges and groups of mountains horrible to behold, and of bogs, deep &s;wampy narrow bottoms, and waters that fall and run innu|merable ways: but this is not always the ca&s;e: like the charming plain I am now on, there are many flowery and delicious exten|&s;ive pieces of ground, enclo&s;ed by va&s;t &s;ur|rounding hills &mdash; the fine&s;t intervals be|twixt the mountains: the &s;weete&s;t interchange between hill and valley, I believe in all the world, is to be found in Richmond&s;hire, and in &s;everal of tho&s;e delightful vales I di&s;co|vered inhabitants as in this place: but the hou&s;es are &s;o &s;eparated by fells &s;carce pa&s;&s;able, and torrents of water, that tho&s;e who live in the centre of one group of mountains know not any thing of agreeable inhabitants that may dwell on the other &s;ide of the hills in an adjacent vale. If there had been a fine &s;pot at the bottom of the precipice I found the opening in, and people living there, (as might have been the ca&s;e) you ladies who live here, could have no notion of them, as you knew nothing of a pa&s;&s;age from the foot to the &s;ummit of yonder mountain, within &s;ide of the va&s;t hill, and if you did, would never venture to vi&s;it that way; and as there is not a pa&s;s in this chain of hills, to ride or walk through, to the other &s;ide of them: but the way out of this valley we are now
<PB N="408" REF="423">in, as I judge from the trending of the mountains all round us, mu&s;t be an opening into &s;ome part of Cumberland. For this rea&s;on Stanemore hills may have &s;everal fa|milies among them, tho' you have never heard of them, and I will now give you an account of &s;ome, who behaved in the mo&s;t kind and generous manner to me. Here I be|gan to relate &s;ome particulars concerning my friend <HI>Price</HI> and his excellent wife; the ad|mirable Mrs. <HI>Burcot</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Fletcher;</HI> the <HI>philo&s;ophers</HI> who lived at <HI>Ulubrae,</HI> to whom I was returning; and the generous Mr. <HI>Har|court,</HI> and his excellent daughter, whom I left in the morning; and at who&s;e hou&s;e I arrived by travelling up the dark bowels of a tremendous mountain; as, on the contrary, I arrived at theirs by a de&s;cent through yon|der frightful hill, till I came rolling out by a fall within, in a very &s;urpri&s;ing and comical way; a way that would have made you laugh, ladies; or, in a fright, cry out, if you had happened to be walk|ing near the hole or opening in the bot|tom of that hill, when, by a &s;lip of my foot, in de&s;cending, a few yards from the day, I tumbled over and over, not only down what remained of the dark &s;teep within, but the high &s;loping bank that reaches from the the out&s;ide of the opening to the fir&s;t flat part of the vale. There is nothing wonderful
<PB N="409" REF="424">then in my living in this lone country for &s;o many days. The only &s;trange thing is, con|&s;idering the waters and &s;wamps, that I was not drowned; or, an account of the preci|pices and de&s;cents I have been engaged on, that I did not break my neck, or my bones: but &s;o long we are to live as Providence hath appointed for the accompli&s;hment of the grand divine &s;cheme. Till the part allotted us is acted, we are &s;ecure. When it is done, we mu&s;t go, and leave the &s;tage for other players to come on.</P>
<P>The ladies &s;eemed greatly entertained with my hi&s;tories, and e&s;pecially with my tumb|ling out of the mountain into their vale. They laughed very heartily; but told me, if they had happened to be &s;itting near the hole, in the bottom of that tremendous rocky mountain, as they &s;ometimes did, and often wondered where the opening went to, and that I had come rolling down upon them, they would have been frightened out of their &s;en&s;es; for they mu&s;t have thought it a very &s;trange appearance: without hear|ing the hi&s;tory of it, they mu&s;t think it a prodigious occurrence, or exception from the con&s;tant affairs of nature.</P>
<P>This might be, ladies, (I an&s;wered,) but from &s;eeing me before your eyes you mu&s;t own, that many things may be fact, which at fir&s;t may &s;eem to exceed the common li|mits
<PB N="410" REF="425">of truth. Impo&s;&s;ible or &s;upernatural &s;ome people conclude many ca&s;es to be that have not the lea&s;t difficulty in them, but happen to be made of occurrences and places they have not &s;een, nor heard the like of before. Things thought prodigious or in|credible by ignorance and weakne&s;s, will appear to right knowledge and a due judg|ment very natural and accountable to the thoughts.</P>
<P>Here a footman came up to us, to let his mi&s;tre&s;s know that dinner was on the table, and we immediately went in to an excellent one. The ladies were very civil to me, and exerted a good humour to &s;hew me, I &s;up|po&s;e, that my arrival was not di&s;agreeable to them, tho' I tumbled upon their habitation, like the genie of the caverns, from the hol|lows of the mountains. They talked in an ea&s;y, rational manner, and a&s;ked me many que&s;tions that &s;hewed they were no &s;trangers to books and men and things: but at la&s;t it came to pa&s;s, that the elde&s;t of tho&s;e ladies, who acted as mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, and &s;eem|ed to be about one or two and twenty, de&s;ired to know the name of the gentleman I was looking for among the&s;e hills, and called my friend. My rea&s;on, Sir, for a&s;king is, that you an&s;wer &s;o exactly in face and per&s;on to a de&s;cription of a gentleman I heard not very
<PB N="411" REF="426">long ago, that I imagine it may be in my power to direct you right.</P>
<P>Madam, (I replied), the gentleman I am in &s;earch of is <HI>Charles Turner,</HI> who was my &s;choolfellow, and my &s;enior by a year in the univer&s;ity, which he left two years before I did, and went from <HI>Dublin</HI> to the north of <HI>England,</HI> to inherit a paternal e&s;tate on the decea&s;e of his father. There was an uncom|mon friend&s;hip between this excellent young man and me, and he made me promi&s;e him, in a &s;olemn manner, to call upon him as &s;oon as it was in my power; a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that if by any changes and chances in this lower hemi&s;phere, I was ever brought into any perplexities, and he alive, I &s;hould be welcome to him and what he had, and &s;hare in his happine&s;s in this world, while I plea&s;ed. This is the man I want: a man, for his years, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the race. His hone&s;t heart had no de&s;ign in words. He ever &s;poke what he meant, and therefore, I am &s;ure he is my friend</P>
<P>To this the lady an&s;wered, Sir, &s;ince <HI>Charles Turner</HI> is the man you want, your enquiry is at an end, for you are now at his hou&s;e; and I, who am his &s;i&s;ter, bid you welcome to <HI>Skel&s;more-Vale</HI> in his name. He has been for a year and a half la&s;t pa&s;t in Italy, and a little before he went, gave me &s;uch a de&s;cription of you as enabled me to
<PB N="412" REF="427">gue&s;s who you were after I had looked a while at you, and he added to his de&s;crip|tion a reque&s;t to me, that if you &s;hould chance to call here, while I happened to be in the country, that I would receive you, as if you were him&s;elf; and when I removed, if I could not, or did not chu&s;e to &s;tay lon|ger in the country, that I would make you an offer of the hou&s;e, and give you up all the keys of it, to make u&s;e of it and his &s;er|vants, and the be&s;t things the place affords, till his return; which is to be, he &s;ays, in le&s;s than a year. Now, Sir, in regard to my brother and his friend, I not only offer you what he de&s;ired I &s;hould, but I will &s;tay a month here longer than I intended; for this lady, (my cou&s;in, <HI>Martha Jacquelot)</HI> and I, had determined to go to <HI>Scarborough</HI> next week, and from thence to <HI>London:</HI> nor is this all: as I know I &s;hall the more oblige my brother the civiller I am to you, I will, when the Scarborough &s;ea&s;on is over, if you chu&s;e to &s;pend the winter here, come back to <HI>Skel&s;more-Vale,</HI> and &s;tay till Mr. Turner returns.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e a&s;toni&s;hed me to the la&s;t degree &mdash; to hear that I was at my friend Turner's hou&s;e, &mdash; he abroad, and to be &s;o for another year: the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;eat offered me; and his charming &s;i&s;ter &s;o very civil and good, as to a&s;&s;ure me &s;he would
<PB N="413" REF="428">return from the Spaw, and &s;tay with me till her brother came home: the&s;e were things &s;o unexpected and extraordinary, that I was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay. I pau&s;ed for &s;ome minutes, with my eyes fa&s;tened on this beauty, and then &s;aid &mdash; Mi&s;s <HI>Turner,</HI> the account you have given of your brother, and the information that I am now at his hou&s;e &mdash; his friendly of|fers to me by you, and your prodigious ci|vility, in re&s;olving to return from Scar|borough, to &s;tay with me here till your bro|ther arrives, are things &s;o &s;trange, &s;o un|common, and exceedingly generous and kind, that I am quite amazed at what I hear, and want words to expre&s;s my obligations, and the grateful &s;en&s;e I have of &s;uch favors. Accept my thanks, and be a&s;&s;ured, that while I live, I &s;hall properly remember the civility and benevolence of this day; and be ever ready, if occa&s;ion offered, and the fates &s;hould put it in my power, to make a due return. Your offer, madam, in particular, is &s;o high an honour done me, and &s;hews a &s;pirit &s;o hu|mane, as I told you I was an unfortunate one, that I &s;hall ever think of it with plea|&s;ure, and mention it as a rare in&s;tance of female worth: but as to accepting the&s;e mo&s;t kind offers, I cannot do it. Since Mr. <HI>Tur|ner</HI> is from home, I will go and vi&s;it another friend I have in this country, to whom I
<PB N="414" REF="429">&s;hall be welcome, I believe, till your bro|ther returns. To live by my&s;elf here at my friend's expence, would not be right, nor agreeable to me: and as to confining you, madam, in &s;taying with me, I would not do it for the world. Sir, (Mi&s;s <HI>Turner</HI> replied) in re&s;pect of my &s;taying here, it will be no confinement to me, I a&s;&s;ure you. My heart is not &s;et upon going to London. It was only want of company made Mi&s;s <HI>Jacquelot</HI> and me think of it, and if you will &s;tay with us, we will not even go to Scarborough this &s;ea&s;on. &mdash; This was goodne&s;s indeed: but again&s;t &s;taying longer than two or three days, I had many good rea&s;ons that made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to depart: be&s;ide the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of my being an expence to Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> in his ab&s;ence, or confining his &s;i&s;ter to the country; there was <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> where I had left <HI>O Fin,</HI> my lad, at work, to which I could not avoid going again: and there was Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth,</HI> on whom I had promi&s;ed to wait, and did intend to a&s;k her if &s;he would give me her hand, as I liked her and her circum&s;tances, and fan&s;ied &s;he would live with me in any retreat I plea&s;ed to name; which was a thing that would be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to my mind. It is true, if <HI>Charles Turner</HI> had come home, while I &s;tayed at his hou&s;e, it was po&s;&s;ible I might have got his &s;i&s;ter, who was a very great
<PB N="415" REF="430">fortune: but this was an uncertainty how|ever, and in his ab&s;ence, I could not in ho|nour make my addre&s;&s;es to her: if it &s;hould be again&s;t his mind, it would be acting a fal&s;e part, while I was eating his bread: Mi&s;s <HI>Turner</HI> to be &s;ure had fifty thou&s;and pounds at her own di&s;po&s;al, and &s;o far as I could judge of her mind, during the three days that I &s;tayed with her at <HI>Skel&s;more-Vale,</HI> I had &s;ome rea&s;on to imagine her heart might be gained: but for a man worth no|thing to do this, in her brother's hou&s;e, with|out his leave, was a part I could not act, tho' by mi&s;&s;ing her I had been brought to beg my bread. Three days then only I could be prevailed on to &s;tay, and the time indeed was happily &s;pent.</P>
<P><LABEL>Mi&s;s Tur|ner's cha|racter.</LABEL> Mi&s;s <HI>Turner</HI> was good-humoured, &s;en&s;ible, and di&s;creet, as one could wi&s;h a woman to be, talked plea&s;antly upon common &s;ubjects, and was well acquainted with the three no|ble&s;t branches of polite learning, antiquity, hi&s;tory, and geography. It was a fine en|tertainment to hear her. She likewi&s;e un|der&s;tood mu&s;ick, and &s;ung, and played well on the &s;mall harp&s;ichord: but her moral character was what &s;hed the brighte&s;t lu&s;tre on her &s;oul. Her thoughts and words were ever employed in promoting God's glory, her neighbour's benefit, and her own true welfare; and her hand very often, in giving
<PB N="416" REF="431">to the poor. One third of her fine income &s;he devoted to the mi&s;erable, and was in every re&s;pect &s;o charitable, that &s;he never indulged the lea&s;t intemperance in &s;peaking. She dete&s;ted that calumny and reproach which a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates a credit, as much as &s;he abhorred the &s;hedding a man's blood. The goodne&s;s of her heart was great indeed: the integrity of her life was glorious. She was perfection, &s;o far as the thing is con|&s;i&s;tent with the nature and &s;tate of man here&mdash;as it was po&s;&s;ible for a mortal to be exempt from blame in life, and blemi&s;h of &s;oul. An ab&s;olute exemption from faults cannot be the condition of any one in this world: But (to the ladies I now &s;peak), you may, like mi&s;s <HI>Turner,</HI> be eminently good, if you will do your be&s;t to be perfect in &s;uch a kind and degree as human frailty doth admit.</P>

<HEAD>83. A morning reflexion on the ri|&s;ing &s;un, and the Great Spi|rit who created it.</HEAD>
<P> The &s;un was ri&s;ing as we mounted the hor&s;es, and &s;truck me &s;o powerfully with the &s;urpa&s;&s;ing &s;plendor and maje&s;ty of its appearance, &s;o cheared me by the glad&s;ome influences, and intimate refre&s;hment of its all-enlivening beams, that I was contriving as I rid on an apology for the fir&s;t adorers of the &s;olar orb, and imagined they intended nothing more than the wor&s;hip of the tran|&s;cendent maje&s;ty of the invi&s;ible Creator,
<PB N="419" REF="434">under the &s;ymbol of his mo&s;t <HI>excellent</HI> and nearly re&s;embling creature; and this accord|ing to &s;ome <HI>imperfect</HI> tradition, that man, as a <HI>compound Being,</HI> had, in the beginning, a <HI>vi&s;ible glorious pre&s;ence</HI> of <HI>Jehovah Elo|him</HI> &mdash; a vi&s;ible exhibition of a more di|&s;tingui&s;hed pre&s;ence by an inexpre&s;&s;ible brightne&s;s or glory: this is &s;ome excu&s;e for the fir&s;t wor&s;hippers of the &s;olar orb: and when the thing con&s;ecrated to the imagery and repre&s;entation of its Maker, became the rival of his honours, and from being a help to devotion, was advanced into the &s;upreme object of it; yet con&s;idering the prodigious glory of this moving orb, and that all ani|mated nature depends upon its <HI>au&s;picious pre&s;ence,</HI> we cannot wonder that the <HI>Egyp|tian rurali&s;ts,</HI> without a <HI>creed,</HI> and without <HI>a philo&s;ophy,</HI> &s;hould be tempted to &s;ome warmer emotion than a merely &s;peculative admiration, and inclined to &s;omething of immediate devotion.

<P>And e&s;pecially, when from the earth I lift up my eyes to the heavens, and behold among the wonders of the firmament, that va&s;t and magnificent orb, the &s;un now ri&s;ing before me, brightning by degrees the hori|zon, and pouring the whole flood of day upon us; the wonderful and grand &s;cene &s;trikes powerfully on my mind, and cau&s;es an awful impre&s;&s;ion. With &s;entiments of the greate&s;t admiration, I con&s;ider the illu&s;|trious object, and feel the kindly heat of that bright luminary, in&s;piring me with more than u&s;ual gladne&s;s. And what power is it that &s;upplies this fountain of light and heat, with his genial and inexhau&s;ted trea|&s;ure &mdash; who di&s;pen&s;es it with &s;uch muni|ficent, yet wi&s;e profu&s;ion? It mu&s;t be &s;ome Almighty Being. It mu&s;t be the work of the Deity, that is, the powerful, wi&s;e, and good Parent of mankind, the Maker, Pre|&s;erver, and Ruler of the world; for his perfections are &s;tampt upon the work. The
<PB N="429" REF="444">evidence of rea&s;on declares it. Chance or nece&s;&s;ity cannot form or guide. An active under&s;tanding only, and intending cau&s;e, can produce, and direct: and this cau&s;e, mu&s;t be all-ruling wi&s;dom, and unlimited power, in conjunction with the mo&s;t amiable good|ne&s;s. This is plain to a thorough and rational examination. A &s;upreme Being, an eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent mind, who comprehends and pre&s;ides over all, mu&s;t impart the benefits of that glorious creature before me, u&s;ing it as an inanimate, uncon&s;cious, in&s;trument of conveying light, heat, and prolific influences to the <HI>earth;</HI> which, by infinite power, is rendered as much active in &s;ending the ve|gete juices through the ve&s;&s;els of all plants, as the &s;un is in diffu&s;ing its rays upon the &s;urface of the globe we inhabit. The <HI>&s;un,</HI> and <HI>moon,</HI> and <HI>&s;tars,</HI> are but in&s;truments in his hand, for bringing about mechanically whatever good effects he has created them to produce. Our <HI>holy religion</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophic</HI> rea&s;oning evince this truth. This glorious &s;un bears the &s;ignatures of its author, and the finger of God is di&s;cernible every where. The wi&s;dom and loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord are vi&s;ible, whatever way we turn. His bounty appears by its con&s;tant, yet vo|luntary communication, and is the more to be admired as it is a never-failing principle. This ri&s;ing luminary that vi&s;its our earth, is,
<PB N="430" REF="445">in particular, a daily fre&s;h in&s;tance of the divine favor; and did not God's goodne&s;s only, prevent its &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, we &s;hould be involved in the utmo&s;t horror, nay, inevitable ruin: and when, in the evening it leaves us over&s;pread by the darkne&s;s, to vi&s;it others with its benign influences; the change is charming, for night gives man a nece&s;&s;ary vacation from the labours of the day. In &s;leep he takes the &s;weete&s;t refre&s;hment, till this ri&s;ing &s;un, by the beneficent direction of its great Author, again appears in grace and &s;plendor, and di&s;plays the face of nature in un&s;peakable beauties. Every where the bounty of the &s;upreme Spirit I &s;ee diffu&s;ed; through air, through earth, and in the wa|ters. No place is without witne&s;&s;es of his liberality; and life is the care of his provi|dence.</P>
<P>Of him then &s;hould our &s;ongs be, and our talking of all his wonderful works. We &s;hould join in adoring him, and acknowledge him <HI>worthy to receive glory and honour and power, who has created all things, and for his plea&s;ure they are and were created.</HI> And it follows, that we &s;hould likewi&s;e ab&s;olutely &s;ubmit to this &s;overeign Being, and ever re|&s;ign our&s;elves to his direction and di&s;po&s;al.

<P> In this manner were my thoughts employed, as we rid over the brows of many high hills, with the ri&s;ing &s;un before me, till we de&s;cended to a narrow wet bottom, which trended due we&s;t for an hour, and brought us to the foot of another high mountain. This we a&s;cended with the hor&s;es as far as it was po&s;&s;ible to bring them, and from thence I climbed up to the top, by a &s;teep craggy way, near 200 yards.

<HEAD>86. A &s;trange meeting.</HEAD>
<P> But when I came near the man&s;ion, no human creature could I &s;ee, nor, for &s;ome time, could I find an entrance any way. The gate of the garden in which the hou&s;e &s;tood was fa&s;t, and &s;o was every window and door: but as the gardens were in fine order, and full of fruits, vegetables, and flow|ers, I knew it mu&s;t be an inhabited place, tho' its people were from home. With my pole therefore I leaped a deep moat, which &s;urrounded the garden, and for half an hour continued walking about it, pulling &s;ome things, and looking at others, in hopes that &s;ome one might be &s;een: no &s;oul how|ever appeared, and I was going to return to
<PB N="433" REF="448">my hor&s;es, when, by accident, I came to a de|&s;cent of &s;tairs, that was planted round with &s;hade of laurel, ever-green, and branching palm. Down I went immediately. I walked thro' a long arched pa&s;&s;age, in which two lamps were burning, and at the end of it came to an open door, that admitted me into an en|try which led to a flight of &s;tairs. Should I go any farther, was the que&s;tion? If any one within, I might greatly offend: and if it was the habitation of rogues, I might find my&s;elf in a pound. What &s;hall I do then? Go on, (&s;ays curio&s;ity) and bravely fini&s;h the adventure.</P>
<P>Softly then I a&s;cended, li&s;tening, by the way, if I could hear any voice, and proceed|ed upwards, to the fir&s;t floor. A door was there open, and on my tiptoes I went to look in: but, all I could &s;ee was a room well furni&s;hed, and through it I pa&s;&s;ed to another, which was likewi&s;e full of fine things, and had a door unlocked, that open|ed into a large library. The books were all bound in vellum, in an extraordinary man|ner, the collection valuable, and mo&s;t judi|ciou&s;ly ordered. Mathematical in&s;truments of all Sorts were on a table, and every thing looked as belonging to a &s;cholar and man of fortune. Great was my amazement, as I &s;aw no living creature. I knew not what to think of all the&s;e things: nor did my a&s;to|ni&s;hment dimini&s;h, when I went from the
<PB N="434" REF="449">library into two very hand&s;ome bedcham|bers, and &s;aw in one of them the apparel of a woman; in the other the dre&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ing on the&s;e matters, and looking over the books, I continued near an hour, when I turned round to depart, and &s;aw at the door of the library I was in, a gentleman, and two young ladies in riding-dre&s;&s;es, who &s;eemed more than amazed at the &s;ight of me. The man's face I knew very well, and &s;oon remembred he was one of the com|pany that came over with me from <HI>Ireland</HI> in the <HI>Skinner and Jenkins,</HI> and a per&s;on I had thought a very odd man; for he never &s;tirred out of his birth all the while he was on board, nor &s;poke a &s;yllable to any one, ex|cept my&s;elf; and that only for a couple of hours after we landed; when he was plea&s;ed to &s;ingle me out, and reque&s;ted we might dine together; to which I &s;aid, with plea|&s;ure, Sir, and he came with mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> and me to our inn. With us he &s;at for the time I have &s;aid, and talked like a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue. He was but three or four years older than I was, and yet &s;o very grave, that in re&s;pect of temper, he was fit for the bench. He told me, he lived in too remote a place, ever to expect to &s;ee me in the coun|try; but he had a hou&s;e in London, where he was every winter, if not hindered by &s;ick|ne&s;s, and to a part of it I &s;hould be wel|come

<P>Mr. <HI>Berrisfort</HI> (I an&s;wered), you may well wonder at &s;eeing me in this remote and &s;ilent part of the world, and e&s;pecially at my being in your &s;tudy, without either hor&s;e or attendant in waiting, that you could find, on coming home; but the thing was all natu|ral, in the common cour&s;e of events, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>Three weeks after you left me at <HI>White|haven,</HI> I &s;et out from that place for Brugh under Stanemore, and went from thence up the northern mountains, in &s;earch of a gen|tleman I had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with, who lives but a few miles beyond you, and on my return from his hou&s;e, as the road lay very high on the &s;ide of yonder va&s;t hill, I quitted my hor&s;e out of curio&s;ity, to climb up to the top of the mountain, and &s;ee what kind of country lay on the other &s;ide of this long range of high hills. It was with great difficulty I got up to the pike, and few, perhaps, but my&s;elf, would attempt it: I was rewarded however by the

My admiration was great, you may be &s;ure, and the books too &s;trong a temptation for me not to mind them. With great plea|&s;ure I looked into many of them, and at la&s;t opened the Greek writer I was reading out, when you came to the door of your &s;tudy.

<P>(Mr. <HI>Berrisfort</HI> replied): Sir, I am glad there was any thing in the force and opera|tion of ca&s;ualties, that could bring you to my hou&s;e, and I a&s;&s;ure you upon my word, that you are mo&s;t heartily welcome. As I lay in my cabbin on &s;hip-board, I conceived a great regard for you, on account of many

<P> Early in the morning, we went out with the hounds, and for half a dozen hours, had the dogs in full cry before us.

His &s;i&s;ter and cou&s;in were very good; di&s;creet in their be|haviour, temperate in their di&s;cour&s;e, and ea&s;y in their manner.

<P> It was not in my complexion to &s;tay, and by that means, I got a terrible fall the &s;econd day; whether by my own fault, or my hor&s;e's, I cannot tell: but as no bone was broke, and I had received no o|ther mi&s;chief than a black eye, a brui&s;e in my &s;ide, and a torn face, I was &s;oon on my
<PB N="443" REF="458">mare again, and by Mi&s;s <HI>Berrisfort</HI>'s &s;ide. She laughed immoderately at me, while the dogs were at fault, as my bones were &s;afe, and advi&s;ed me with a humorous tender|ne&s;s, to ride with her brother and Mi&s;s <HI>Fox.</HI> It was not however very long before I had more &s;atisfaction than I de&s;ired; for in half an hour's time, we came to &s;ome pales, which the &s;tag went over, and I leaped fir&s;t; but Mi&s;s <HI>Berrisfort</HI>'s hor&s;e, tho' one of the be&s;t in the world, unfortunately &s;truck, and cleared them in &s;uch a manner, that the lovely <HI>Juliet</HI> came over his head. She fell very &s;afely in high gra&s;s, where I waited for her, for fear of an accident of any kind, and did not receive the lea&s;t hurt; but in the violence of the motion, and the way &s;he came down, the curtain was thrown on her brea&s;t, and &s;he lay for &s;ome moments &s;tunn'd upon the ground. In a minute however I &s;natched her up, and &s;et her on her feet. She came to her&s;elf immediately, and thanked me for my care of her; but was vexed to the heart at what had happened. She reque&s;ted I would not mention the thing to her brother, or Mi&s;s <HI>Fox,</HI> and hoped I would be &s;o generous as not to &s;peak of it to any one. &mdash; Mi&s;s <HI>Berrisfort</HI> (I &s;aid) it is not in my &s;oul to ex|tract a mirth from the bad fortune of any one; and much le&s;s is it in my power to ri|dicule, or laugh at a woman of di&s;tinction,

This gave her &s;ome relief, and by her foot in my hands, I lifted her into her &s;addle again. &mdash; Two benefits were from this mi&s;chance derived.

<P> Vexatious as the fall was to this young lady, it was I however that had all the pain, by the mi&s;chief I received when my hor&s;e threw me. My eye was in a &s;ad black way, my &s;ide troubled me, and the &s;kin was off half my face: yet I did not much mind it, as the diver&s;ion was good, and that imme|diately after the death of the &s;tag, we ha&s;t|ened back to an excellent dinner, and &s;ome fla&s;ks of old generous wine; to which <HI>Bob Berrisfort</HI> and I &s;at for two or three hours.

<P><PB N="445" REF="460">I am thinking (Mr. <HI>Berrisfort</HI> &s;aid, after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, as we &s;at &s;moaking a pipe over again&s;t each other), that the cau&s;e you gave Dr. <HI>Whaley,</HI> on &s;hip-board, for the decay of chri&s;tianity, was the be&s;t I have heard. I remember you told this divine, that it was not a want of faith in the pre&s;ent generation that made &s;o many renounce chri|&s;tianity; for, the world were no enemies to a <HI>republication of the law of nature</HI> by the <HI>man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> but the thing that makes <HI>infidels,</HI> and &s;upports infidelity, is the ex|travagant doctrines which the theologers have obtruded upon the church, as e&s;&s;ential parts of chri&s;tianity. Enthu&s;ia&s;m, ab&s;ur|dity, and error, and the blind and bloody &s;cenes of cruelty and &s;uper&s;tition, have been the great &s;tumbling-blocks to mankind, and given the mo&s;t &s;ad, &s;evere and la&s;ting &s;tabs, to the intere&s;ts and &s;ucce&s;s of the pure and peaceable go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. This is ju&s;t. But exclu&s;ive of this, may we not &s;ay, that there are &s;o many &s;eeming contradictions, and a multiplicity of ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages in it, that it looks as if it could not be, in its pre|&s;ent condition, a rule of faith: and that chri&s;tians differ &s;o much about the meaning of the texts of their bible, that rea&s;on knows not what to &s;ay to a religion &s;o variou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented. It is not only the two great camps, <HI>papi&s;t</HI> again&s;t <HI>prote&s;tant,</HI> and <HI>prote|&s;tant</HI>
<PB N="446" REF="461">again&s;t <HI>papi&s;t,</HI> who make the religion as different as black and white: that the <HI>re|formed mi&s;&s;ion</HI> at <HI>Malabar</HI> tell the <HI>Indians</HI> they mu&s;t not hearken to the je&s;uits, if they expect &s;alvation; and the <HI>monks</HI> at <HI>Coroman|del</HI> declare, on the contrary, to tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> that they will be damned to eternity, if they are converted to what the Dani&s;h mini&s;ters call chri&s;tianity; which made the famous <HI>bramin Padmanaba</HI> &s;ay, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to become a chri&s;tian, till the learned chri&s;tian prie&s;ts had agreed among them|&s;elves what chri&s;tianity was; for he had not erudition and judgment enough to decide in the intricate controver&s;y: but, exclu&s;ive of this, prote&s;tants are &s;o divided among them|&s;elves, even the church of England again&s;t the church of England&mdash;di&s;&s;enters again&s;t di&s;&s;enters &mdash; and give &s;uch different ac|counts of the reveled &s;y&s;tem, that it requires more under&s;tanding, and &s;trict, &s;erious en|quiry, than the generality of people have, or can &s;pare, to be able to determine in what party of the celebrated critics and expo&s;itors true religion is to be found: and when the controver&s;y is &s;o dark and various, and the authorized profe&s;&s;ors can never agree among them&s;elves, what can a man of a plain under|&s;tanding &s;ay to it? This makes many (I ima|gine) turn from the &s;criptures to &s;tudy na|ture, and the general laws which are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="447" REF="462">among the &s;everal gradations, ranks and cla&s;&s;es of beings, &s;o far as they are connected with intelligent, moral agency. In the natural, agreeable pages of that infi|nite volume, we &s;ee and perceive beauty and order, art, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, and are thereby led to the Creator and Governor of the world, the univer&s;al cau&s;e, pre&s;erver, and director of nature. We di&s;cover his providence, mea&s;ures and benevolence, the rules and principles of eternal, immutable wi&s;dom and rea&s;on, and by them are com|pelled to confe&s;s a univer&s;al, intelligent Efficient; one infinite, eternal, omnipotent, wi&s;e, good Being, from whom all others derive, and on whom all others nece&s;|&s;arily depend, and that continually. In &s;hort, by &s;tudying nature, we di&s;cover a God of truth, order and rectitude, and as we find perfect univer&s;al truth, and moral recti|tude to be the highe&s;t perfection in the Deity, our rea&s;on informs us, that we ought to &s;hew our love of God, by a love of the&s;e; and that a regular, uniform pur&s;uit of them, mu&s;t be the only true and rational pur&s;uit of human happine&s;s. Here is a plain and good religion. Can we wonder then that many &s;tudy and follow nature, and di&s;regard tho&s;e intere&s;ted commentators, who, like oppo&s;ite coun&s;el at the bar, multiply and make void the law by different and contradictory plead|ings on it? &mdash; Here <HI>Bob</HI> ended, and lit
<PB N="448" REF="463">his pipe again, while <HI>Jack</HI> laid his down, and went on in the following manner:</P>
<Q><P><LABEL>An apology for true chri&s;tia|nity.</LABEL> As chri&s;tianity was in&s;tituted by its great Author and Publi&s;her, for the benefit of mankind, it is to be lamented that the di|vines &s;hould &s;o differ, concerning what ge|nuine reveled religion is, as to cau&s;e many to renounce this &s;tanding and perpetual rule of faith and manners: but as to contradictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies in the apo&s;tle's writings, I have read them over &s;everal times, and never could find &s;uch things in them. Ob|&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages there are a few at fir&s;t &s;ight; but a little con&s;ideration can explain them by other &s;criptures, if we do no, like &s;ome commentators, endeavour, by forced con|&s;tructions, to adapt the &s;en&s;e of them to a &s;y&s;tem. This is what ruins chri&s;tianity. The monks &s;hut out the light of rea&s;on, which is to explain &s;cripture by &s;cripture, and in the dark, fan&s;y a <HI>metaphy&s;ical theology:</HI> They &s;peculate a <HI>trithei&s;tic my&s;tery, original &s;in, divine &s;overeignty, election, reprobation,</HI> with many other pieties, and call the things <HI>reve|lation,</HI> which are, in <HI>reality,</HI> an <HI>artificial, invented corruption of the go&s;pel.</HI> The ma|jority of the doctors in&s;i&s;t upon it that their reverend notions are reveled religion, and where they have a power, wattle the people into them: but men who will u&s;e the <HI>human under&s;tanding</HI> their Creator has given
<PB N="449" REF="464">them, and employ the rea&s;on of men in the choice of their religion, very ea&s;ily perceive that <HI>unnatural repre&s;entation</HI> could never come down from heaven; and that what|ever the declaimers on human nature may &s;ay in prai&s;e of their go&s;pel, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be in&s;piration, when the propo|&s;itions rather merit laughter and contempt than the attention of rational creatures. This makes the Indians of any under&s;tanding flee chri&s;tianity. This cau&s;es men of &s;en&s;e, in a free country, to declare again&s;t reveled re|ligion. The principal <HI>offence</HI> mu&s;t remain, while the majority of the clergy continue to blind the human under&s;tanding, and in&s;tead of couching the cataract, darken the &s;ouls of the people with a &s;uffu&s;ion of my&s;tery: to which I may add, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to make u&s;e of <HI>unexceptionable, &s;criptural</HI> forms of expre&s;&s;ion in divine public &s;ervice, though an alteration might be made without any po&s;&s;ible danger or injury to the church, and continue to u&s;e in our liturgy <HI>un&s;crip|tural</HI> phra&s;es, and <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> notions, the imaginations of weak men. While this is done, the chri&s;tian religion mu&s;t &s;uffer, and of con&s;equence, the <HI>divines</HI> who contend for my&s;tery, and labour to de&s;troy human rea|&s;on and the powers thereof; to &s;tifle and ex|tingui&s;h our common notions of things, and preclude all rea&s;oning what&s;oever upon the
<PB N="450" REF="465">&s;ubject of religion; mu&s;t have the blood of more &s;ouls to an&s;wer for, in the approach|ing day of calamity, than they now &s;eem to imagine, while great preferments blind their under&s;tanding, and render them in&s;olent and po&s;itive. All this however has nothing to do with the true go&s;pel. If men would read the hi&s;torical, and the argumentative parts of the &s;acred writings with hone&s;ty, and explain them as right rea&s;on and true critici&s;m directs; if they would &s;tudy them with that true zeal, which is guided by a good light in the head, and which con&s;i&s;ts of good and innocent affections in the heart; and have at the &s;ame time a knowledge of the cu&s;toms which prevailed, and the notions that were commonly received in tho&s;e di&s;tant ages and countries, they would find no incon&s;i&s;tencies and contradic|tions in the &s;criptures: even the difficulties would &s;oon di&s;appear. The &s;acred writings would appear to be what they are &mdash; a &s;y&s;tem of religion that an&s;wers to all our wi&s;hes and de&s;ires: &mdash; that requires of us that obedience to which as rational beings we are antecedently bound; and offers us rewards for obeying more than nature could ever claim. In the go&s;pel, we have the re|ligion of nature in perfection, and with it a certainty of mercy and unutterable ble&s;&s;ings: but in natural religion, as the rea&s;on and un|der&s;tanding of men can collect it, our hopes
<PB N="451" REF="466">of pardon and glory have but uncertain foun|dation. Without revelation, our hopes are liable to be di&s;turbed and &s;haken by frequent doubts and mi&s;givings of mind: but in re|veled religion, that is, the moral law repub|li&s;hed by in&s;pired men, the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel take in all the wi&s;hes of nature, and e&s;tabli&s;h all her hopes. Ble&s;&s;ed be God then for &s;ending his well-beloved Son into the world. From him we have a law that is holy, and the commandment holy, and ju&s;t, and good: and by a dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this plain and perfect law, (in which there is <HI>no my&s;tery, no incon&s;i&s;tency, no contradic|tion,)</HI> we are delivered from condemnation by the grace of God through Chri&s;t. Here is rea&s;on for adoring the divine goodne&s;s. The go&s;pel gives a better evidence for the truth and certainty of life and immortality than nature before had given, and thereby di&s;plays the love that God has for the chil|dren of men.</P></Q>
<P>To this Mr. <HI>Berrisfort</HI> &s;aid, that he thought my plea for original chri&s;tianity was good, and allowed it was not the go&s;pel that was faulty in my&s;tery and ob&s;curity, contra|diction and incon&s;i&s;tency; but, human ig|norance, and human vanity, which have load|ed it with ab&s;urdities, while they excluded rea&s;oning about it, and warped its fair and heavenly maxims to the intere&s;ts of &s;y&s;tems
<PB N="452" REF="467">and temporalities. However (Bob conti|nued), you will allow, I believe, that the &s;acred writers had not perpetually the aid of an unerring Spirit, and therefore are &s;ome|times incon&s;i&s;tent in their accounts: that as they were &s;ometimes de&s;titute of divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, they were liable to error when guided only by the human &s;pirit, and did act like common men upon &s;everal occa&s;ions. This &s;eems to be evident from the relations, and the human &s;entiments of the apo&s;tles. The evangeli&s;ts &s;peak of the &s;ame facts dif|ferently; and in citing prophecy, while one adapts a fact to the letter of the prophecy, another accommodates the letter of the pro|phecy to the letter of the fact: I mean here, the <HI>a&s;s and colt</HI> in <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the <HI>colt</HI> only in <HI>John,</HI> and their citing <HI>Zechariah</HI> (ix. 9.) differently. And as to the other &s;a|cred writers, does not the di&s;pute between <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;hew a &s;ubjection, &s;ome|times, to ignorance and error? does not the quarrel between <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> let us &s;ee, that one of them was mi&s;taken, and both of them to be blamed? Tell me like|wi&s;e, what you think of <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s different accounts of the time of the crucifix|ion &mdash; and does not <HI>Matthew</HI> contradict <HI>Mark</HI> in his relation of the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us?</P>
<P><HI>Jack Buncle</HI> to this replied, that however &s;ome zealots may contend for the perpetual in&s;pi|ration
<PB N="453" REF="468">of the &s;acred writers, yet he could not think &s;uch doctrine nece&s;&s;ary to the creed of a chri&s;tian: <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only is called <HI>the truth,</HI> and was incapable of error. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> only, in all his actions, was directed by a prophetic &s;pirit. All other men, prophets and apo&s;tles, were &s;ometimes left to the guidance of their own &s;pirit; and therefore all things which they have &s;ignified to us by their words or deeds, are not to be con&s;idered as divine oracles. <HI>Nec adeo omnia, quaecunque dictis &s;ignificarunt aut factis, ea pro divinis oracu|lis habenda.

<P><HI>Courcelles</HI> was born in the year 1586, and died the 29th of May, 1659, aged 73.

As <HI>St. Mark</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Je&s;us
<PB N="477" REF="492">appeared fir&s;t to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had ca&s;t out &s;even devils:</HI> and after &s;he had reverenced her dear Lord and Ma&s;|ter, he bid her go immediately to his di&s;|ciples, and tell them &s;he had &s;een him: let them al&s;o know that I have a&s;&s;ured thee, I &s;hall quickly leave this world, and a&s;cend to the <HI>God and Father of us all, my Father and your Father, my God and your God,</HI> unto tho&s;e happy man&s;ions where he manife&s;ts his pre&s;ence in a mo&s;t e&s;pecial manner; there to receive full power over all things both in heaven and earth, and to prepare a place for you; that where I am, there ye may be al&s;o. <HI>Mary</HI> accordingly departed. She told the apo&s;tles that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had appeared to her, and acquainted them with the <HI>joyful</HI> me&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>As to the other women, it is evident that they likewi&s;e went a &s;econd time to the &s;e|pulchre, to look for the body of their ma&s;ter, and having in vain &s;earched for it, were re|turning to the apo&s;tles, to let them know they had enquired to no purpo&s;e, when <HI>Je|&s;us</HI> him&s;elf met them, &s;aying All hail. Does not this <HI>reconcile Mark's account with Mat|thew's?</HI> I think &s;o. To me it is &s;o very plain from what all the &s;acred relators have declared of the matter, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed how <HI>Jerom</HI> could be &s;o perplexed with the
<PB N="478" REF="493">two accounts, as to &s;ay, that <HI>Mark's account,</HI> (the la&s;t twelve ver&s;es of his go&s;pel) might be rejected here as <HI>&s;purious,</HI> becau&s;e it was found only in a few copies of that go&s;pel, and contradicted the other evangeli&s;ts. <HI>Non recipimus Marci te&s;timonium, quod in raris fertur evangeliis &mdash; prae&s;ertim cum diver&s;a atque contraria evangeli&s;tis ceteris narrare videatur.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, if the account I have given was liable to any objection, and you could &s;hew me that it was not the truth of the ca&s;e; which, at pre&s;ent, I think impo&s;&s;ible: If it was evident from the go&s;pels, that the women were not a &s;econd time at the tomb, but that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> appeared to <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> and the <HI>other women,</HI> the fir&s;t time they were all there together, yet this may be, as I ap|prehend, without <HI>Mark</HI>'s contradicting <HI>Mat|thew.</HI> The meaning of the words of <HI>Mark &mdash; he appeared fir&s;t to Mary Magdalene</HI> &mdash; might be, that as &s;he and the women were returning from the monument, to tell the news to the apo&s;tles, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> appeared to them, and in particular, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>Mary Magdalene;</HI> directing his di&s;cour&s;e to her, and &s;peaking familiarly and affectionately to her, to di&s;tingui&s;h her as his con&s;tant follower in his life-time, and one on whom he had worked a great miracle of healing.
<PB N="479" REF="494">This, I imagine, might very ju&s;tly be term|ed &mdash; <HI>he appeared fir&s;t to Mary Magdalene</HI> &mdash; To appear fir&s;t to any one of a company, as I take it, is to come up to, or &s;tand before &s;ome particular per&s;on, in order to &s;peak to &s;uch per&s;on.

</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid, (Mr. <HI>Berrisfort</HI> told me), &s;eems plau&s;ible, nd ought to &s;atisfy every hone&s;t man. It gives me content: but there is one thing &s;till that perplexes me,
<PB N="480" REF="495">and that is, the various lections of the New Te&s;tament. Do they not hurt the book?</P>
<P>No: <HI>(Jack Buncle</HI> replied), notwith&s;tand|ing the cry of infidels, and that &s;ome learned men of the church of Rome have endea|voured to &s;hake the credit of the two te&s;ta|ments, and to bring the people to the papal chair, to know the truth, on account of the various readings; yet, neverthele&s;s, they are rather an advantage and &s;ecurity to the &s;acred text than a detriment to the written word. They corroborate the authority of the &s;acred book, and give it additional advantages.</P>
<P>It is a truth that there are many various read|ings in <HI>Terence, Livy, Virgil, Cae&s;ar, Thucy|dides, Homer, Plutarch,</HI> etc. and yet who de|nies the genuinene&s;s and great u&s;e of tho&s;e noble authors of &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s? who is &s;o hardy as to que&s;tion whether the works univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to them be their own and the product of tho&s;e immortal wits? On the contrary, men of thought and clear heads, conver&s;ant in tho&s;e &s;tudies, will agree that tho&s;e authors of antiquity of which there are the mo&s;t various readings, are rendered the mo&s;t pure and correct. And why &s;hould not the various readings of the bible rather lead men of &s;ound learning and judgment to the true meaning of the divine writers, than endanger their mi&s;taking their genuine lan|guage and &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="496">Where there are &s;everal readings, it is highly probable one of them is the original; and it is ea&s;ier by their help to rectify the mi&s;takes of &s;ome copies, for when we have only one manu&s;cript, there may be &s;cope for fancy; but none for judicious compari&s;on and well-grounded critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Style and language may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a happy genius of natural &s;agacity, im|proved by true learning and proper applica|tion, as well as &s;tatues, pictures, and me|dals. No age can counterfeit Cicero, Te|rence, St. Mark, St. John, St. Paul, no more than a counterfeit picture, medal, etc. can be impo&s;ed on, and deceive the com|pleat ma&s;ters and judges of tho&s;e ingenious profe&s;&s;ions and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is nothing in the various lections that affects the e&s;&s;entials of religion, or can imply a con&s;iderable depravation of the copies, that alters or weakens one moral contained in the divine books. And there|fore, though it cannot with rea&s;on be &s;up|po&s;ed, that God Almighty &s;hould work per|petual miracles to prevent the mi&s;takes and blunders of every carele&s;s or corrupt hand, of tho&s;e numerous tran&s;cribers of tho&s;e &s;a|cred volumes, no more than by a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s power and re&s;traint to prevent all the errors and villanis committed by free and account|able creatures; yet the argument receives &s;trength, that notwith&s;tanding the innume|rable
<PB N="482" REF="497">variations, mi&s;takes and contradictions in &s;mall matters, the all-&s;eeing eye of Pro|vidence has &s;o watched his own ble&s;&s;ed and glorious revelations to mankind, that <HI>all the tran&s;cripts of that divine volume agree in the e&s;&s;ential doctrine and grand de&s;ign of chri&s;tia|nity.</HI> This is a truth that Infidels and Pa|pi&s;ts cannot di&s;prove.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve in the la&s;t place, that exclu&s;ive of the care of Providence, there could not po&s;&s;ibly happen any detriment to our &s;acred records by various readings: for though in an innumerable number of copies of the go&s;pel that were made before printing was known, and in the many tran&s;lations of it into &s;everal languages, where the idioms are different, and the phra&s;e may be mi&s;taken, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould not be various lections, and &s;lips of amanuen&s;es, yet the &s;acred volumes in the early ages of chri&s;tianity, were di&s;po&s;ed into innumerable hands, tran&s;lated into &s;o many languages, kept in &s;o many libraries, churches, and in private families of believers, and &s;o carefully pre&s;erved and revered as the authentic deeds and charters of eternal happine&s;s, that they were not capable of being fal&s;ified.</P>
<P>Nor could tho&s;e ine&s;timable copies, &s;cat|tered as they were over the then di&s;covered world, and in the noble language &s;o univer|&s;ally known and acceptable, be liable to ha|zards, by &s;udden revolutions and public di&s;|a&s;ters;
<PB N="483" REF="498">becau&s;e tho&s;e convul&s;ions and &s;ur|prizing calamities, could not happen alike in every country at one time.</P>
<P>Neither could a general corruption of manners, a &s;pirit of profu&s;ene&s;s or &s;uper&s;ti|tion, nor the wicked example, and &s;trong influence of tyrannical princes, of an apo|&s;tate clergy, and athei&s;tical mini&s;ters of &s;tate, prevail over many di&s;tant and independant nations, to endeavour to corrupt and de&s;troy their &s;acred book.</P>
<P>On the contrary, we are to con&s;ider that chri&s;tianity was the eccle&s;ia&s;tical law of all chri&s;tian nations under the &s;un. The <HI>great law</HI> which a&s;&s;ured to them their religious right and properties, their claims and titles to immortality, to the inheritance of the &s;aints in light, an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, re&s;erved for them in the heavens. Which, to every one that de&s;erves the name of <HI>man</HI> and <HI>chri|&s;tian</HI> mu&s;t be infinitely more dear than titles to lands on this earth. For men are naturally more watchful in a matter &s;o dear to them, and every believer would think him&s;elf con|cerned, no more to let a change of con&s;e|quence to pa&s;s uncorrected, than the children of this world, who are wi&s;e&s;t in their gene|ration, would overlook a flaw in deeds of &s;ale, or contract, which would a&s;&s;ert their title, and evacuate the main intention of making &s;uch indentures.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="499">The primitive chri&s;tians mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be exceeding watchful and jealous that no corruption or abu&s;es &s;hould be put on that &s;acred book, more dear and valuable to them than all <HI>other intere&s;ts</HI> and <HI>trea&s;ures.</HI> When the&s;e brave champions of the cro&s;s were brought to the tribunals of the heathen per&s;ecutors, and were commanded to deliver their bible to the flames, they mo&s;t cou|rageou&s;ly refu&s;ed it, and gave their bodies to be burnt rather than the divine book.</P>

Upon this hypothe&s;is, the enemy undertakes to &s;hew, that the prophecies, &s;o applied by them, do not at all relate to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in their proper and literal &s;ignification, but only in &s;econdary, typical, and figurative &s;en&s;e: but then this way of in|terpreting them is equivocal, precarious, and incapable of yielding any rational &s;atisfaction; and of con&s;equence chri&s;tianity has no foundation. Such is the u&s;e the enemy make of the prophecies applied by the evange|li&s;ts.</P>
<P>In truth, if we admit that chri&s;tianity has no other foundation than what the enemy a&s;&s;ign it, it might not perhaps be difficult for them to make good the re&s;t: for upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, many objections are thrown in our way, which it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to get rid of. But while they fancy them&s;elves to be demoli&s;hing founda|tions, they are battering only &s;uch parts of the edifice,

as &s;erve for its ornaments rather than its &s;upport: and had the enemy gone farther, and &s;hewn that &s;ome of the <HI>prophecies cited by Matthew</HI> did not relate to Je&s;us in any &s;en&s;e at all, they would have done no more than what &s;ome of the primitive fathers, as well as modern critics had done before them, without de&s;igning or do|ing the lea&s;t hurt to chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us</HI> declared in general, that <HI>Mo&s;es and the prophets had te&s;tified of him:</HI> but &s;ince the evangeli&s;ts did not think it nece&s;&s;aay to give a preci&s;e account, or deduc|tion of the &s;everal prophecies, which were alleged by him in proof of that declaration; it is &s;ufficient to take it, ju&s;t as we find it; without thinking our&s;elves obliged to defend all the particular in&s;tances or applications, which were offered afterwards in &s;upport of it by fallible men. Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> in his <HI>literal accompli&s;hment of the &s;cripture prophecies,</HI> has produced 45 <HI>prophecies</HI> from the Old Te&s;tament, which are cited in the New, in proof <HI>of the Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip of Je&s;us,</HI> and which he declares to have been <HI>clearly and directly fulfilled, without the lea&s;t pretence of any reply from any author what&s;oever.</HI> Now if any number of the&s;e, how &s;mall &s;oever, are found to be as clearly accompli&s;hed, as he takes them to be, they are &s;ufficient to &s;upport the authority of the go&s;pel, tho' all the re&s;t were thrown a&s;ide.</P>
<P>But to &s;ay the truth, the grounds of our faith, in the&s;e <HI>latter ages of the church,</HI> do not lie in the particular interpretations of prophecies, made by men, who might be mi&s;taken, and who, as <HI>Jerome</HI>

But <HI>Jerome</HI> abhorred a woman, as much as Mrs. <HI>A&s;tel</HI> did a man: and dete&s;ted and black|ened <HI>matrimony</HI> and a <HI>wife,</HI> to extol and exalt that whim of his brain, virginity. With dete&s;tation (he owns), he beheld every big bellied woman, (the fine&s;t &s;ight in the world) tho' rendered &s;o in the holy matrimonial bed, and could not bear looking at her, but as he reflected, that &s;he carried a virgin, So he tells us in his letters; and of con&s;equence, a fit &s;upporter of St. Peter's chair.</P>

With my pole in my hand then I &s;et out, and after I had bid adieu to my friends, who walked with me a couple of miles to the foot of the hills, I bagan to mount the Alp at Six in the morning, and at eight arrived on its &s;ummit. Here I had a fine road, due &s;outh, for an hour, till I came to a very &s;teep de&s;cent, that led to the &s;haking-bog, as my paper of directions informed me. It was an ugly way down, and the better to go it, I re&s;olved fir&s;t to breakfa&s;t, and bid <HI>Tim</HI> &s;ee what he had got in his wallet.

<P> The&s;e Men were three brothers, and Roman catholics. Two of them were gentle|men-farmers, who lived together, and jointly managed the country bu&s;ine&s;s. The elde&s;t was a Franci&s;can frier, who came to vi&s;it them. Their good manners, in their plain dre&s;s, &s;urprized me; and their benevolence, made me wonder a great deal more. Their maid
<PB N="499" REF="514">laid a clean cloth in a minute, and brought &s;ome cold roa&s;t beef, good bread, and fine ale. They bid me heartily welcome many times, and were &s;o frank and generous, &s;o chearful and gay; e&s;pecially the elde&s;t of the farmers, who &s;ang &s;everal good &s;ongs over a bowl of punch after dinner, that I could not think of leaving them immediately, if I had known my road, and was ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;tay &s;everal days. A friend&s;hip com|menced immediately between the elde&s;t <HI>Fleming</HI> and me, and there was not one cold or cro&s;s minute in it for the few years that he lived.

<P> But as to the &s;haking bog I was to have pa&s;&s;ed to go to the gentlemen at <HI>Ulubrae, Fleming</HI> told me, I had a fortunate e&s;cape in not venturing over it; for, tho' it be pa&s;&s;able in one narrow way, about a yard broad, yet a &s;tranger to the bog mu&s;t peri&s;h in attempt|ing to cro&s;s; as the timber cau&s;eway that was made over the great mar&s;h, time out of mind, is invi&s;ible in many places, and one &s;inks for ever, the moment he &s;teps off that way: but I will &s;hew you an ea&s;y road (my new friend continued) to the gentlemen's hou&s;e, to whom I am no &s;tranger, and will make you acquainted with &s;ome pa&s;&s;es thro' the mountains, that will render it ea&s;ier riding over this country than you have found it. He did &s;o, and by his guidance I ar|rived at <HI>Ulubrae,</HI> the 7th day of July; being the 17th day from the morning I left the philo&s;ophers. The gentlemen were &s;tartled at the &s;ight of me, as they concluded I had peri&s;hed, and had, as they a&s;&s;ured me,
<PB N="503" REF="518">mourned my &s;ad fate: they were impatient to hear the adventure of the mountain, and by what &s;trange means, I was jumbled all the way to <HI>Tom Fleming</HI>'s; who lives &s;o far from the hill I went into; and the road from it to his hou&s;e, &s;carce pa&s;&s;able for a mortal. Inform us, we be&s;eech you, how the&s;e &s;trange things came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;aid, I am extremely o|bliged to you for your concern for me, and will tell you my &s;tory as &s;oon as we have dined, as the &s;ervants are now bringing the di&s;hes in, and accordingly, when we had done, I gave them a relation in detail. They were greatly plea&s;ed with my hi&s;tory, and much more, to have me returned to them in &s;afety again. If they had not &s;een me, they &s;aid, they could not believe the thing, and they would order the whole account to be entered in the journal of their &s;ociety, as the mo&s;t extraordinary ca&s;e they had ever known: or, perhaps, &s;hould ever hear re|lated again. Their &s;ecretary, as directed, writ it down in the big book of tran&s;actions, and it remains in their records to this day.&mdash; In &s;hort, reader, the&s;e worthy men were &s;o greatly rejoiced at my being alive, when they thought me for certain among the dead, that they put the bottle round in a fe&s;|tal manner after dinner. We drank and laughed till it was midnight.</P>

<HEAD>99. My depar|ture from Ulubrae to Eggle&s;ton.</HEAD>
<P>The 8th day of July,  I took my
<PB N="504" REF="519">leave of the gentlemen at <HI>Ulubrae,</HI> and pro|ceeded to the Ea&s;t-riding of York&s;hire, to look for Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth. Fleming</HI> came with me as far as <HI>Eggle&s;ton</HI> to &s;hew me the pa&s;&s;es between the hills, and the be&s;t ways over the mountains. Many va&s;t high ones we cro&s;&s;ed, and travelled through very wonderful glins. Several &s;cenes were as charming as any I had before &s;een, and the low ways as bad; but he knew all the roads and cro&s;s turnings per|fectly well, and &s;hortned the journey a great many miles. I had told him the bu|&s;ine&s;s I was going on, and he reque&s;ted, if I &s;ucceeded, that I would bring Mi&s;s <HI>Mel|moth</HI> to his hou&s;e, that his brother might marry us; and as to <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> which I had de&s;cribed to him, and told him where to find, (for he had no notion of it, nor had ever been among the fells of We&s;tmoreland; as he thought that country unpa&s;&s;able), he promi&s;ed me, he would go there him&s;elf, and bring with him two labouring men to a&s;&s;i&s;t my lad, in putting the garden and hou&s;e in the be&s;t condition they were ca|pable of receiving; that he would bring there &s;eeds, and trees, &s;uch as the &s;ea&s;on allowed, and do every thing in his power, to render the place convenient and plea&s;ing: he would likewi&s;e &s;ell me a couple of his cows, a few &s;heep, and other things, which I &s;hould find before me at the lodge, and let me have one of his maids for my &s;ervant in
<PB N="505" REF="520">the hou&s;e. This was good indeed. I could not wi&s;h for more</P>

<HEAD>100. 1725, From Eg|gle&s;ton I went to Mrs. A&s;|gil's to look for Mi&s;s Mel|moth; but &s;he was gone.</HEAD>
<P> The 9th of July, early in the morn|ing, <HI>Fleming</HI> and I parted, and I proceeded as fa&s;t as well I could to the appointed &s;ta|tion: but when I came up to Mrs. <HI>A&s;gill</HI>'s door, the 2d day in the evening, July 10, and a&s;ked for Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth,</HI> an old man, the only per&s;on in the hou&s;e, told me, Mrs. <HI>A&s;gill</HI> had been dead near a month, and Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> went from thence immediately after the funeral of her friend; that &s;he had left a letter with him for a gentleman that was to call upon her; but that letter by an accident was de&s;troyed, and where the lady then was, he could not &s;o much as gue&s;s: he farther told me, that Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> had &s;old the goods of the hou&s;e, and the &s;tock, bequeathed to her by her decea&s;ed friend, to the gentleman who inherited the late Mrs. <HI>A&s;gill</HI>'s jointure, and &s;he would return no more to the place. This was news to me. It &s;truck me to the &s;oul. Doleful tidings, how ye wound. What to do I could not tell, but as I rid to the next town, determined at la&s;t, to try if I could hear of her at York. To that city I went the next day, a&s;ked at the inns, walked the walls, and went to the a&s;&s;embly-room. My enquiries were all in vain. One gentleman only did I &s;ee who was acquainted with her, and he knew nothing of her pre&s;ent abode. From York then I proceeded the next morn|ing
<PB N="506" REF="521">to &s;earch other towns, and left no place unexamined where I could think &s;he might be. Three weeks were &s;pent in this manner, without hearing a &s;yllable of her, and then I thought it was be&s;t to return to my lodge; for what &s;ignified my five hundred pounds to appear with in the world. It mu&s;t be &s;oon gone as I had not the lea&s;t notion of any kind of trade; and if I joined any one that was in bu&s;ine&s;s, I might be mi&s;taken in the man, and &s;o cheated and undone. Then what could I do but carry a brown mu&s;ket, or go a hand before the ma&s;t; for, as to being an u&s;her to a &s;chool for bread, were I reduced to want, that was the life of all lives that I mo&s;t abhorred. Nothing el&s;e then had I for it but my &s;ilent mountain-lodge, which kind providence had brought me to. There I re|&s;olved to go, and in that charming &s;olitude, peru&s;e alone the book of nature, till I could hear of &s;ome better way of &s;pending my time.</P>

<HEAD>101. By acci|dent, I meet Mi&s;s Melmoth.</HEAD>
<P> To this purpo&s;e then I went the 2d of Augu&s;t, 1725, to <HI>Barnard's Ca&s;tle</HI> in <HI>Durham,</HI> and intended the next morning to &s;et out for Mr. <HI>Fleming</HI>'s hou&s;e in <HI>Stanemore,</HI> to go from thence to my cottage on the &s;ide of a <HI>We&s;tmorland-Fell:</HI> but after I had rid a mile of the road to <HI>Eggle&s;ton,</HI> where I pur|po&s;ed to dine, I called out to my lad to &s;top. A &s;udden thought came into my head, to ride fir&s;t to <HI>Gretabridge,</HI> as I was &s;o near it,
<PB N="507" REF="522">to &s;ee &s;ome fine Roman monuments, that are in the neighbourhood of that village. To that place I went then, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in looking over all the antiquities and curio&s;i|ties I could find there. I returned in the evening to my inn, and while a fowl was roa&s;ting for my &s;upper, &s;tood leaning again&s;t the hou&s;e-door, looking at &s;everal travellers that went by, and &s;ome that came to re&s;t where I did that night. Many figures I be|held, but none I knew. At la&s;t there came riding up to the inn, full &s;peed, a young lady on a mo&s;t beautiful bea&s;t, and after her, two hor&s;es more; on one of which was her man &s;ervant, and on the other her maid. She had a black ma&s;k on her face, to &s;ave her from the du&s;t and &s;un, and when &s;he lit from her hor&s;e, &s;he id not take it off, but went with it on into the hou&s;e, after &s;he had looked for a moment or two at me. This I thought very &s;trange. A charmer to be &s;ure, I &s;aid. With what life and grace did &s;he come to the ground! but how cruel the dear little rogue is, to conceal the wonders of its face. Landlord, I &s;aid to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who was coming up to me, can you contrive a way to get me one view of that ma&s;ked lady, and I will give you a pint. &mdash; Sir, mine ho&s;t replied, that I can do very ea&s;ily, for this lady has &s;ent me to let you know, &s;he wants to &s;peak with you &mdash;
<PB N="508" REF="523">with me! &mdash; Tran&s;porting news! I flew to her apartment, and there &s;aw that dear irre&s;i&s;table creature, who had added to the <HI>inferior</HI> charms of face and per&s;on, that <HI>wi&s;|dom</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of <HI>conauct</HI> and <HI>conver&s;ation,</HI> which are the <HI>true glory</HI> of a <HI>woman.</HI> It was Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth.</HI> She had heard I had been at Mrs. <HI>A&s;gill</HI>'s hou&s;e, and did not get the letter &s;he left for me; which made her think of riding towards <HI>Gretabridge,</HI> on an imagination &s;he might find me thereabout; as &s;he remembered to have heard me &s;ay, in one of our conver&s;ations, that I intended as &s;oon as I could, to look at the Roman anti|quities in this place: but &s;he had very little hopes (&s;he added) of &s;ucceeding in her en|quiry; as little as I had of her riding up to the inn; and this made the meeting the more plea&s;ing. It did enhan&s;e the plea&s;ure indeed. It turned the amour into an adventure, and gave it that delicious flavor, which the mo|derns read of in the hi&s;tories of pa&s;t times, but rarely experience in the&s;e days. The reader that has been engaged in &s;uch a won|derful, and tender &s;cene, can only form an idea of a felicity, which words would in vain attempt to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had &s;upped, I recited my adventures &s;ince we parted, and gave Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> a flowery de&s;cription of <HI>Orton-Lodge;</HI> then a&s;ked, if &s;he would ble&s;s me with her
<PB N="509" REF="524">hand, and &s;it down with me in my pretty &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Sir, (Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> replied), if you re|quired it, I would go with you to <HI>Hud&s;on's-Bay,</HI> had I a hundred thou&s;and, in&s;tead of four thou&s;and pounds; which is my for|tune, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome per&s;onal e&s;tate, which my friend Mrs. <HI>A&s;gill</HI> by her will bequeathed me; and the whole is at your &s;ervice, to di&s;po&s;e of as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Give me thy hand then (I &s;aid,) thou ge|nerous girl. You make me the happie&s;t of men, and in return I &s;wear by that <HI>one, &s;u|preme, tremendous Power</HI> I adore, that I will be true and faithful to thee, till death di&s;|&s;olves the &s;acred obligation. Twice do I &s;wear by the <HI>great Spirit,</HI> in who&s;e dread pre&s;ence I am, with your right hand now locked fa&s;t in mine, acro&s;s this table, and call on him as witne&s;s to our vows, that nei|ther time, nor chance, nor aught but death's inevitable hand, &s;hall e'er divide our loves. Mi&s;s <HI>Melmoth</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>102. 1725. Mi&s;s Mel|moth and I proceed to Orton-Lodge, and are married by Father Fleming.</HEAD>
<P>Early the next morning,  the third of Augu&s;t, we rid to <HI>Eggle&s;ton,</HI> where we breakfa&s;ted, and proceeded from thence to Mr. <HI>Fleming</HI>'s hou&s;e, up Stanemore hills, where we arrived at nine o'clock in the evening, and had beds there that night. My friend <HI>Tom</HI> and his brother <HI>Jemmy,</HI> were gone to a fair; but the elde&s;t bro|ther,
<PB N="510" REF="525">the <HI>Franci&s;can fryer,</HI> was at home, and entertained us very well. We took him with us very early the next day to <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> which we reached at eight in the evening, and found the hou&s;e and garden in good order. My friend, Mr. <HI>Fleming,</HI> had done every thing po&s;&s;ible, to make it a con|venient and comfortable place. He had made near the Lodge two little rooms for &s;ervants, and had put a bed in the green-hou&s;e in the garden for a friend. He had likewi&s;e &s;ent there a couple of cows, &s;ome &s;heep and lambs, ducks and gee&s;e, cocks and hens, and every nece&s;&s;ary he thought we might want there. <HI>Good Tom Fleming.</HI> There never was a better man, or a kinder friend, to his &s;mall power.</P>
<P>We had likewi&s;e fi&s;h in abundance, in the waters at the foot of our hills, and goats and kids, and plenty of wild fowl. Few things were wanting that rea&s;on could de&s;ire; and for us, who thought that happine&s;s, that is, plea&s;ure and repo&s;e, did not precariou&s;ly depend on what others think, or &s;ay, or do; but &s;olidly con&s;i&s;ted in what we our&s;elves did feel, and reli&s;h, and enjoy, there could not be a more delightful &s;tation di&s;covered on this globe.</P>
<P>To conclude, the be&s;t things that <HI>Orton-Lodge</HI> afforded, were ordered to the fire, and before they were brought on the table, the
<PB N="511" REF="526">man of God threw the fillet or ribband over our hands, according to the Romi&s;h man|ner, and pronounced the nuptial benediction on us. Hu&s;band and wife we &s;at down to &s;upper.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus did the &s;tars pre&s;ide with friendly rays,</L>
<L>And bid me hail at la&s;t the happy days,</L>
<L>When &s;heltered within this wild retreat,</L>
<L>Above the &s;corn, below the rage of fate;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t in a wife, a friend, and books, alone;</L>
<L>To this mad world, and all its plagues un|known;</L>
<L>The &s;mooth-pac'd hours did &s;weetly pa&s;s away,</L>
