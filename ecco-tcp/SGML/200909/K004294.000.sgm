<HEAD>The Force of fired Gun-powder, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THESE experiments I made at Woolwich in the &s;ummer of the year 1775, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;everal able officers of the royal artillery at that place, and other ingenious gentlemen. The object of them was the determination of the actual velocities with which balls are impelled from given pieces of can|non, when fired with given charges of powder. The&s;e experiments were made according to the method in|vented by Mr. ROBINS, and de&s;cribed in his treati&s;e, in|titled, New Principles of Gunnery, of which an account was printed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1743. Before the di&s;coveries of that ingenious gentleman very little progre&s;s had been made in the true theory of military projectiles. His book, how|ever, contained &s;uch important di&s;coveries, that it was
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;oon tran&s;lated into &s;everal of the languages on the con|tinent, and the famous Mr. L. EULER honoured it with a very exten&s;ive commentary in his tran&s;lation of it into the German language. That part of it hath always been particularly admired which relates to the experimental method of a&s;certaining the actual velocities of &s;hot, and in imitation of which were made the experiments re|lated in this paper. Experiments in the manner of Mr. ROBINS were generally repeated by his commentators and others, with univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, the method being &s;o ju&s;t in theory, &s;o &s;imple in practice, and altogether &s;o ingenious, that it immediately gave the fulle&s;t convic|tion of its excellence, and of the abilities of its author. The u&s;e which that gentleman made of this invention was, to obtain the actual velocities of bullets experi|mentally, in order to compare them with tho&s;e which he computed <HI>a priori</HI> from his new theory, and thereby to verify the principles on which it is founded. The &s;uc|ce&s;s was fully an&s;werable to his expectations, and left no doubt of the truth of his theory, when applied to &s;uch pieces and bullets as he had u&s;ed: but the&s;e were very &s;mall, being only mu&s;ket balls of about one ounce weight; for, on account of the great &s;ize of the ma|chinery nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch experiments, Mr. ROBINS and other ingenious gentlemen had not ventured to extend
<PB N="5" REF="5">their practice beyond bullets of that kind, and &s;atisfied them&s;elves with earne&s;tly wi&s;hing for experiments to be made in a &s;imilar manner with balls of a larger &s;ort. By the experiments in this paper I have endeavoured, in &s;ome degree, to &s;upply this defect, having made them with &s;mall cannon balls of above twenty times the &s;ize, or from one pound to near three pounds weight. The&s;e are the only experiments that I know of which have been made with cannon balls for this purpo&s;e, although the conclu|&s;ions to be deduced from &s;uch are of the greate&s;t impor|tance to tho&s;e parts of natural philo&s;ophy which are de|pendent on the effects of fired gunpowder; nor do I know of any other practical method of a&s;certaining the initial velocities of military projectiles within any tole|rable degree of the truth. The knowledge of this velo|city is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in gunnery: by means of it, together with the law of the re&s;i&s;tance of the me|dium, every thing is determinable relative to that bu&s;i|ne&s;s; for, be&s;ides its being an excellent method of trying the &s;trength of different &s;orts of powder, it gives us the law relative to the different quantities of powder, to the different weights of &s;hot, and to the different lengths and &s;izes of guns. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there does not &s;eem to be any thing wanting to determine any inquiry that can be made concerning the flight and ranges of &s;hot, except the effects ari&s;ing from the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="6">
<HEAD>Of the nature of the experiment, and of the machinery u&s;ed in it.</HEAD>
<P>The intention of the experiment is to di&s;cover the actual velocity with which a ball i&s;&s;ues from a piece, in the u&s;ual practice of artillery. This velocity is very great; from one thou&s;and to two thou&s;and feet in a &s;e|cond of time. For conveniently e&s;timating &s;o great a velocity, the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary is to reduce it, in &s;ome known proportion, to a &s;mall one. This we may con|ceive to be effected thus: &s;uppo&s;e the ball, with a great velocity, to &s;trike &s;ome very heavy body, as a large block of wood, from which it will not rebound, &s;o that they may proceed forward together after the &s;troke. By this means it is obvious, that the original velocity of the ball may be reduced in any proportion, or to any &s;low velocity which may conveniently be mea&s;ured, by making the body &s;truck to be &s;ufficiently large; for it is well known, that the common velocity, with which the ball and block of wood would move forward after the &s;troke, bears to the original velocity of the ball only, the &s;ame ratio which the weight of the ball hath to that of the ball and block together. Thus then veloci|ties of one thou&s;and feet in a &s;econd are ea&s;ily reduced to
<PB N="7" REF="7">tho&s;e of two or three feet only; which &s;mall velocity being mea&s;ured by any convenient means, let the num|ber denoting it be increa&s;ed in the proportion of the weight of the ball to the weight of the ball and block together, and the original velocity of the ball it&s;elf will thereby be obtained. In the&s;e experiments, this reduced velocity is rendered very ea&s;y to be mea&s;ured by a very &s;imple and curious contrivance, which is this: the block of wood, which is &s;truck by the ball, is not left at li|berty to move &s;traight forward in the direction of the motion of the ball, but it is &s;u&s;pended, as the weight or ball of a pendulum, by a &s;trong iron &s;tem, having a horizontal axis at top, on the ends of which it vibrates freely when &s;truck by the ball. The con&s;equence of this &s;imple contrivance is evident: This large balli&s;tic pendulum, after being &s;truck by the ball, will be pene|trated by it to a &s;mall depth, and it will then &s;wing round its axis and de&s;cribe an arch, which will be greater or le&s;s according to the force of the blow &s;truck; and from the &s;ize of the arch de&s;cribed by the vibrating pendu|lum, the velocity of any point of the pendulum it&s;elf can be ea&s;ily computed; for a body acquires the &s;ame velocity by falling from the &s;ame height, whether it de|&s;cend perpendicularly down, or otherwi&s;e; therefore, the length of the arch de&s;cribed, and of its radius, being
<PB N="8" REF="8">given, its ver&s;ed &s;ine becomes known, which is the height perpendicularly de&s;cended by the corre&s;ponding point of the pendulum. The height de&s;cended being thus known, the velocity acquired in falling through that height becomes known from the common rules for the de&s;cent of bodies by the force of gravity; and this is the velocity of that point of the pendulum: this velocity of any known point whatever is then to be reduced to the velocity at the center of o&s;cillation, by the propor|tion of their radii or di&s;tances from the axis of motion; and the velocity of this center, thus obtained, is to be e&s;teemed the velocity of the whole pendulum it&s;elf; which being now given, that of the ball before the &s;troke becomes known from the given weights of the ball and pendulum. Thus then the men&s;uration of the very great velocity of the ball is reduced to the ob&s;ervation of the magnitude of the arch de&s;cribed by the pendulum, in con&s;equence of the blow &s;truck. This arch may be mea&s;ured after various ways: in the following experi|ments it was a&s;certained by mea&s;uring the length of its chord by means of a piece of tape or &s;mall ribband, the one end of which was fa&s;tened to the bottom of the pen|dulum, and the re&s;t of it made to &s;lide through a &s;mall machine contrived for the purpo&s;e, which will be here|after de&s;cribed; for thus the length of the tape drawn
<PB N="9" REF="9">out, was equal to the length of the chord of the arch de|&s;cribed by the bottom of the pendulum.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription may convey a general idea of the nature and principle of the experiment; but be&s;ides the center of o&s;cillation and the weights of the ball and pen|dulum, the effect of the blow depends al&s;o on the place of the center of gravity and the point of impact: it will, therefore, be now nece&s;&s;ary to give a more particular de|&s;cription of the machine, and of the methods of finding the abovementioned requi&s;ites, and then inve&s;tigate our general rule for determining the velocity of the ball, in all ca&s;es, from them and the chord of the arch of vi|bration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the particular de&s;cription of the machine, and of the determination of the centers of gravity and o&s;cillation.</HEAD>
<P>Tab. 1. Fig. 1. is a repre&s;entation of the machine u&s;ed in the fir&s;t three cour&s;es of experiments; and fig. 2. of that which was u&s;ed in the other two. I &s;hall here de&s;cribe the former of the&s;e, and afterwards take notice of the few particulars in which the other differs from it when I come to treat of the u&s;e of the latter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pendulum con&s;i&s;ted of a block of &s;ound and dry elm, being nearly a cube of twenty inches long,
<PB N="10" REF="10">which was fa&s;tened to a &s;trong iron &s;tem on the back part of it by &s;crew-bolts, having a thick iron axis at the top, who&s;e ends were turned truly cylindrical, to roll pretty freely in &s;ockets made to receive them; the whole being &s;upported by a four-legged &s;tand of very &s;trong timber, which was firmly fixed in the ground. A is the face of the cube into which the balls were fired; by means of the blow it is made to &s;wing round the axis BC, and the chord of the arch thereby de&s;cribed is mea|&s;ured by the tape DEF fa&s;tened to the bottom of the wood at D, and &s;liding with &s;ome &s;light friction through a little machine of bra&s;s, fixed at E for that purpo&s;e, the tape being marked with inches and tenths, for the more ea&s;ily mea&s;uring of the chord or part of it drawn through by the pendulum. The whole length of this pendulum, from the middle of the axis to the ribband at D, was 102&frac12; inches. The weight and the other dimen&s;ions were taken each day when the experiments were made, and then regi&s;tered; and the manner of di&s;covering the places of the centers of gravity and o&s;cillation was as follows:</P>
<P>To find the center of o&s;cillation, the pendulum was hung up, and made to vibrate in &s;mall arcs, and the time of making two or three hundred vibrations was ob&s;erved by a half-&s;econd pendulum. Having thus obtained the
<PB N="11" REF="11">time an&s;wering to a certain number of vibrations, the finding of the center of o&s;cillation is ea&s;y: for if <HI>v</HI> de|note the number of vibrations made in <HI>s</HI> &s;econds, then it is well known, that as <HI>vv</HI> &ratio; <HI>ss</HI> &proportion; 39.2 &ratio; 39.2 <HI>ss</HI>/<HI>vv</HI> &equals; the di&s;|tance in inches from the axis of motion to the center of o&s;cillation; and by this rule the place of that center was found for each day.</P>
<P>The center of gravity was a&s;certained by one or both of the two following methods. Fir&s;t, a triangular pri&s;m of iron AB, being placed upon the ground with an edge upwards, the pendulum was laid <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> acro&s;s it, and moved forward or backward on the &s;tem or block as the ca&s;e required, till the two ends exactly ba|lanced each other; then, as it lay, the di&s;tance was mea|&s;ured from the middle of the axis to the part which re&s;ted on the edge of the pri&s;m, or the center of gravity of the pendulum. The other method was as in the latter of the two annexed figures, where the ends of the axis being &s;upported on fixed uprights, and a chord fa&s;tened to the lower end of the pen|dulum, was pa&s;&s;ed over a pulley at P, dif|ferent weights W were fa&s;tened to the other end of it, till the pendulum was <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="12" REF="12">brought to a horizontal po&s;ition. Then, taking al&s;o the whole weight of the pendulum, and its length from the axis to the bottom where the chord was fixed, the place of the center of gravity is found by this proportion, as <HI>p</HI> the weight of the pendulum &ratio; <HI>w</HI> the appended weight &proportion; <HI>d</HI> the whole length from the axis to the bottom: <HI>dw</HI>/<HI>p</HI> &equals; the di&s;tance from the axis to the center of gravity. Either of the&s;e two methods gave the place of the center of gravity &s;ufficiently exact; but the coincidence of the re&s;ults of both of them was &s;till more &s;atisfactory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the rule for computing the Velocity of the ball.</HEAD>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the methods of obtaining the nece&s;|&s;ary dimen&s;ions, I proceed now to the inve&s;tigation of the theorem by which the velocity of the ball is to be com|puted. The &s;everal weights and mea&s;ures being found, let then
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>b</HI> denote the weight of the ball,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>p</HI> the whole weight of the pendulum,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>g</HI> the di&s;tance of the center of gravity below the axis,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>h</HI> the di&s;tance to the center of o&s;cillation,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>k</HI> the di&s;tance to the point &s;truck by the ball,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>z</HI> the velocity of this point &s;truck after the blow,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="13" REF="13"><HI>v</HI> the original velocity of the ball,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>c</HI> the chord of the arch mea&s;ured by the tape, and</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>r</HI> its radius, or the di&s;tance from the axis to the bot|tom of the pendulum.</ITEM>
</LIST> Then the effect of the blow &s;truck by the ball is as <GAP DESC="math"> or, as <GAP DESC="math"> the weight of a body, which, being placed at the point &s;truck, would acquire the &s;ame velocity from the blow as the pendulum does at the &s;ame point. Here then are two bodies, <HI>b</HI> and <GAP DESC="math">, the former of which, with the velocity <HI>v,</HI> &s;trikes the latter at re&s;t, &s;o that after the blow they both proceed uniformly forward together with the velocity <HI>z;</HI> in which ca&s;e it is well known, that <GAP DESC="math">; and therefore the velocity <HI>z</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">. But becau&s;e of the acce&s;&s;ion of the ball to the pendulum, the place of the center of o&s;cillation will be changed; and from the known property of that point we find <GAP DESC="math"> to its di&s;|tance from the axis. Call this di&s;tance of the center of o&s;cillation, of the ma&s;s compounded of the ball and pendulum, H. Then, &s;ince <HI>z</HI> is the velocity of the point who&s;e di&s;tance is <HI>k,</HI> we have this proportion, as <GAP DESC="math"> the velocity of this compound center of o&s;cillation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">Again, &s;ince <GAP DESC="math"> is the ver&s;ed &s;ine of the de&s;cribed arc <HI>c,</HI> its radius being <HI>r;</HI> therefore as <GAP DESC="math"> the ver&s;ed &s;ine to the radius H, or the ver&s;ed &s;ine of the arc de&s;cribed by the center of o&s;cillation, which call V; then is V the perpendicular height de&s;cended by this center, and the velocity it acquires by the de&s;cent through this &s;pace is thus ea&s;ily found, <HI>viz.</HI> as <GAP DESC="math"> the velocity of the center of o&s;cillation deduced from the chord of the arc which is actually de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained two different expre&s;&s;ions for the velocity of this center, independent of each other, let an equation be made of them, and it will expre&s;s the rela|tion of the &s;everal quantities in the que&s;tion; thus then we have <GAP DESC="math"> from which we obtain <GAP DESC="math"> the true expre&s;&s;ion for the ori|ginal velocity of the ball the moment before it &s;trikes the pendulum.</P>
<P>COROLLARY. But this theorem may be reduced to a form much more &s;imple and fit for u&s;e, and yet be &s;uffi|ciently near the truth. Thus, let the root of the com|pound factor <GAP DESC="math"> be extracted, and it will be equal to <GAP DESC="math"> within the 100000th part
<PB N="15" REF="15">of the truth in &s;uch ca&s;es as generally happen. But &s;ince <GAP DESC="math"> is u&s;ually but about the 300th or 400th part of <HI>pg,</HI> and that <HI>bk</HI> differs from <GAP DESC="math"> but by about the 80th or 100th part of it&s;elf, therefore <HI>pg</HI> &plus; <HI>bk</HI> is within about the 20000th or 30000th part of <GAP DESC="math">. Con&s;equently <HI>v</HI> is <GAP DESC="math"> very nearly. Or, farther, if <HI>g</HI> be written for <HI>k</HI> in the la&s;t term <HI>bk,</HI> then finally <HI>v</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">, or <GAP DESC="math">, which is an ea&s;y theorem to be u&s;ed on all occa&s;ions; and being within about the 3000th part of the truth, it is &s;ufficiently exact for all practical purpo&s;es whatever. Where it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that <HI>c, g, k, r,</HI> may be taken in any mea&s;ures, either feet or inches, &amp;c. provided they be but all of the &s;ame kind; but <HI>h</HI> mu&s;t be in feet, becau&s;e the theorem is adapted to feet.</P>
<P>SCHOLIUM. As the balls remain in the pendulum during the time of making one whole &s;et of experi|ments, by the addition of their weight to it, both its weight and the centers of gravity and o&s;cillation will be changed by the addition of each ball which is lodged in the wood, and therefore <HI>p, g,</HI> and <HI>h,</HI> mu&s;t be corrected after every &s;hot in the theorem for determining the ve|locity <HI>v.</HI> Now the &s;ucceeding value of <HI>p</HI> is always <HI>p</HI> &plus; <HI>b;</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="16">or <HI>p</HI> mu&s;t be corrected by the continual addition of <HI>b:</HI> and <HI>g</HI> is corrected by taking always <GAP DESC="math">, or <GAP DESC="math"> nearly for each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive value of <HI>g;</HI> or <HI>g</HI> is corrected by adding always <GAP DESC="math"> to the next preceding value of <HI>g:</HI> and la&s;tly, <HI>h</HI> is corrected by taking for its new values &s;ucce&s;&s;ively <GAP DESC="math">, or by adding always <GAP DESC="math">, or <GAP DESC="math"> nearly, to the preceding value of <HI>h;</HI> &s;o that the three corrections are made by adding always,

<ITEM><GAP DESC="math"> to the value of <HI>g,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><GAP DESC="math"> to the value of <HI>h.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Before we proceed to the experiments it may not be improper to take notice of three &s;eeming cau&s;es of error, which have not been brought to account in our theorem for determining the velocity of the &s;hot; and to examine here whether their effects can &s;en&s;ibly affect the conclu|&s;ion. The&s;e are the penetration of the ball into the wood of the pendulum, the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to the back of it, and the friction on the axis: by each of the&s;e three cau&s;es the motion of the pendulum &s;eems to be retarded. The principle on which our rule is founded &s;uppo&s;es the momentum of the ball to be communicated to the pendulum in an in&s;tant; but this is not accurately
<PB N="17" REF="17">the ca&s;e, becau&s;e that this force is communicated during the &s;mall time in which the ball makes the penetration; but as this is generally effected before the pendulum has moved one-tenth of an inch out of its vertical po&s;ition, and u&s;ually amounts to &s;carcely more than the 200th part of a &s;econd, its effect will be quite imperceptible, and therefore it may &s;afely be neglected in the&s;e experi|ments. As to the &s;econd retarding force, or the re&s;i&s;tance of the air to the back of the pendulum, it is manife&s;t that it will be quite in&s;en&s;ible, when it is con&s;idered that its velocity is not more than three feet in a &s;econd, that its &s;urface is but about twenty inches &s;quare, and that its weight is four or five hundred pounds. Neither can the effect of the la&s;t cau&s;e, or the friction on the axis, ever amount to a quantity con&s;iderable enough to be brought into account in the&s;e experiments: for, be&s;ides that care was taken to render this friction as &s;mall as po&s;&s;ible, the effect of the little part which does remain is nearly ba|lanced by the effect it has on the di&s;tance of the center of o&s;cillation; for as this center was determined from the actual vibrations of the pendulum, the friction on the axis would a little retard its motion, and cau&s;e its vibrations to be &s;lower, and the con&s;equent di&s;tance of this center to be greater; &s;o that the other parts of our theorem being multiplied by &radic;<HI>h,</HI> or the root of this di&s;tance, which is
<PB N="18" REF="18">as the time of a vibration, it is evident that the friction in the one ca&s;e operates again&s;t that in the other; and that the difference of the two is the real efficacious cau&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, and which therefore is either equal to no|thing, or very nearly &s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e general cau&s;es of error in the principles of the experiments are therefore &s;afely omitted in the theorem: and our only care mu&s;t be to guard again&s;t accidental errors in the actual execution of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the experiments.</HEAD>
<P>The gun, with which the experiments were made, was of bra&s;s; the diameter of the bore or cylinder at the muzzle was 2 4/25, or 2.16 inches; but its diameter next the breech was a &s;mall matter le&s;s, being there only 2 2/25, or 2.08 inches; &s;o that the greate&s;t ca&s;t-iron ball it would admit was ju&s;t 19&frac12; ounces avoirdupois, or 1&frac14; pound want|ing half an ounce; but &s;ometimes leaden balls were u&s;ed, which weighed above 1&frac34; pound, and &s;ometimes long or cylindrical &s;hot which weighed near three pounds; the length of the bore was 42&frac35;, or 42.6 inches, &s;o that it was nearly 20&frac12; calibers long.</P>
<P>The powder u&s;ed was of the &s;ort which is commonly made for government; the quantity was two, four, or
<PB N="19" REF="19">eight ounces to a charge, which was always put into a light flannel bag, and rammed more or le&s;s, as expre&s;&s;ed in each day's experiments, but without ever u&s;ing any wad before it.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance of the gun from the pendulum was 29 or 30 feet; which di&s;tance was found by firing the piece, with eight ounces of powder without a ball, at different di&s;tances, till the force of the ela&s;tic fluid was found not to move the pendulum.</P>
<P>The penetrations of the balls into the wood were at|tempted to be taken, but were &s;oon neglected on account of their uncertainty, becau&s;e of &s;o many balls &s;triking in or near the &s;ame part of the wood. The depth of the penetration &s;eemed to be near about three inches in &s;olid wood when two ounces of powder was u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cour&s;e of experiments was on the 13th of May, 1775, it being a clear, dry day. The weights and mea&s;ures then taken were thus, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>By computing the velocities from our theorem inve&s;|tigated in the corollary, they come out as they are here regi&s;tered in the la&s;t column of the table, and they are all pretty regular excepting the fir&s;t one, which is about one-fourth part le&s;s than the re&s;t with the &s;ame weight of powder, and which irregularity mu&s;t have been cau&s;ed by &s;ome unperceived accident. The values of <HI>p</HI> and <HI>g</HI> were each corrected by their re&s;pective theorems; but the value of <HI>h</HI> was kept the &s;ame (7&frac13; feet) through|out,
<PB N="21" REF="21">becau&s;e that its correction was &s;o &s;mall as not to make a difference of above a foot or two at mo&s;t in the velocity: and for the &s;ame rea&s;on this correction is neglected, as quite unnece&s;&s;ary, in the re&s;t of the experi|ments of the other days following.</P>
<P>The mean velocity of the &s;econd, third, fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth numbers is 626, and of the &s;eventh and eighth it is 915; that is, the velocity with two ounces of pow|der was 626 feet <HI>per</HI> &s;econd, and that with four ounces was 915 feet; and the&s;e two velocities are in the ratio of 1 to 1.46. But the mean weight of the balls in the former ca&s;e was 17&frac13; ounces, and in the latter it was 17&frac18; ounces; and the ratio of the quantities of powder was that of 1 to 2. But the direct &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the powder, compounded with the inver&s;e &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the weights of the &s;hot, forms the ratio of 1 to 1.42, which is nearly equal to the ratio (1 to 1.46) of the velocities; that is, in this in&s;tance the velocities are very nearly as the &s;quare roots of the quantities of pow|der directly, and the &s;quare roots of the weights of the balls inver&s;ely. The powder was forced up with only one &s;troke of the rammer.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cour&s;e was performed on the 3d of June, 1775, which was a clear, dry day, but windy. Some of
<PB N="22" REF="22">the experiments of this day are doubtful, as indeed is evident from their irregularity, on account of the wind blowing the tape, which was not very properly &s;ecured by the little brazen machine through which it was made to &s;lide.</P>
<P>The powder was taken from the bottom of a barrel, and the charges rammed a little clo&s;er than tho&s;e of the former day; and &s;o tight did the &s;hots fit towards the breech, that many &s;trokes of the rammer were nece&s;&s;ary to drive them home.</P>
<P>The fourth and fifth &s;hots were of a long form, which may be called &s;pherico-cylindrical, as they were cylinders terminated by hemi&s;pherical ends, &s;o that their &s;ection through the axis was of this form <FIGURE REND="inline">
</FIGURE>, and the length of the axis was near double the diameter of the &s;hot.</P>
<P>The fourth &s;hot, or fir&s;t of the long &s;ort, &s;truck &s;ide|ways, making a hole of the &s;hape of the above &s;ection, only its length or axis was not horizontal but vertical, thus <FIGURE REND="inline">
</FIGURE>.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;hot lay obliquely in the wood; it appeared to have &s;truck with its end foremo&s;t, or nearly &s;o, as the oblique po&s;ition in which it lay &s;eemed to be cau&s;ed by its &s;triking again&s;t a former &s;hot lodged in the wood, with the hance of its end, &s;o as to flatten it in that part.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">Of the pendulum, the weight, length, and centers of gravity and of o&s;cillation were the &s;ame as when taken the former day before the experiments were made; the former balls having been extracted, and the holes filled up with wood.</P>

<P>Here the fir&s;t &s;hot is again &s;o much &s;maller than the two following ones, that &s;ome irregularity mu&s;t have attended it, on which account we cannot make any u&s;e of it. The mean between the &s;econd and third is 973; and between the fourth and fifth the mean is 749; that is, the velocity of the 19&frac12; ounce ball is 973, and that of the 46&frac12; ounce &s;hot 749 feet <HI>per</HI> &s;econd, which two num|bers are in the ratio of 1.3 to 1. But the reciprocal &s;ub|duplicate ratio of the weights (19&frac12; and 46&frac12;) is the ratio of 1.54 to 1: therefore, in this in&s;tance, the velocity of the heavier &s;hot is a little le&s;s than would ari&s;e from the
<PB N="24" REF="24">inver&s;e ratio of the &s;quare roots of the weights of the &s;hot. But the accurate ratio cannot certainly be drawn from the&s;e numbers, on account of the doubtfulne&s;s of &s;ome of them, as was before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that in the experiments of this day, the mean velocity with two ounces of powder is 973, whereas it was no more than 626 in the former day with the &s;ame quantity of powder, notwith&s;tanding the balls were heavier with the greater velocity in the proportion of 19 to 17 nearly. This remarkable dif|ference mu&s;t be chiefly owing to the windage in the fir&s;t cour&s;e: and from hence we may perceive the great ad|vantage to be gained by the u&s;e of balls approaching in proportion nearer to the diameter of the bore of the gun than what is pre&s;cribed in the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. Po&s;&s;ibly, however, &s;ome part of this difference might be owing to &s;ome &s;mall inequality in the powder, as that which was u&s;ed this day was taken from the bottom of a barrel. Perhaps al&s;o &s;ome part of the effect may be owing to the greater degree of ramming which the pow|der had in this cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The third cour&s;e was made on the 12th of June, 1775, it being a clear, dry, and calm day. The powder in the experiments of this day was rammed in the &s;ame
<PB N="25" REF="25">degree as in the la&s;t one. It was al&s;o nearly the &s;ame in the &s;ucceeding days, as may be perceived by in&s;pecting the fourth column of each cour&s;e, which, denoting the height of the charge, &s;hews the degree of compactne&s;s with which the powder was lodged in the piece.

<HEAD><HI>Of the experiments made with the other pendulum, which is repre&s;ented in fig.</HI> 2.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t pendulum was gradually more and more rent and &s;hattered by the firing of &s;o many balls into it, till at the end of the la&s;t cour&s;e of experiments it had become quite u&s;ele&s;s. Another was then fitted up, and with it were performed the two following cour&s;es.</P>
<P>This &s;econd pendulum con&s;i&s;ted of a cubical block of &s;ound elm, of near two feet long, fixed to the iron &s;tem, but not exactly in the manner of the former; for in this the &s;tem was placed vertically over the center of the top-end, to which point it continued whole, but there divided in two, each pa&s;&s;ing to right and left over the top down the &s;ides, and returning along the bottom, and being at proper intervals fa&s;tened to the wood with iron pins. A thick &s;heet of lead was fa&s;tened over each of the two upright faces into which the &s;hot were to be fired, both to guard them from &s;plintering very much, and to add to the weight of the pendulum. The whole was then firmly &s;ecured by two very thick iron bands or hoops, pa&s;&s;ed horizontally quite around the wood, and
<PB N="27" REF="27">firmly fixed to it, the one next the upper end, and the other near the lower, &s;o as &s;trongly to re&s;i&s;t the endea|vours of the &s;hot to &s;plit the wood.</P>
<P>The whole weight of the pendulum, thus fitted up, was 552 pounds; its whole length, from the middle of the axis to the tape at the bottom, was 101 inches; the di&s;tance to the center of gravity was 78 inches; and the di&s;tance to the center of o&s;cillation was 88 inches equal to 7&frac13; feet, which was exactly the &s;ame as that of the former pendulum, their numbers of vibrations being alike in the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;u&s;pending this pendulum, after the man|ner of the former, by the ends of its axis in grooves turned to fit them, they were only placed on flat, level pieces of wood, on which this pendulum vibrated much freer than the other did; but a &s;mall nail was driven into the &s;upporting wood, ju&s;t behind each end of the axis, to prevent the &s;troke of the &s;hot from throwing it off the &s;tand.</P>
<P>To this pendulum was adapted a better machine for the tape to &s;lide through than the former one was, the inconvenience of which had often been experienced by its catching and entangling the tape, &s;o as to interrupt its free motion, and once indeed to break it. This new one, however, is at once very &s;imple, and perfectly free from
<PB N="28" REF="28">every inconvenience, giving ju&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary degree of friction to the tape, without ever &s;topping its motion; &s;o that of the real quantity drawn out by the vibration of the pendulum there could not po&s;&s;ibly be the lea&s;t doubt. This &s;imple contrivance con&s;i&s;ted barely of about fix or eight inches of the li&s;t of woollen cloth fa&s;tened upon the arch of a &s;mall piece of wood, which was &s;haped into the form of the &s;egment of a circle thus <FIGURE REND="inline">
</FIGURE>, the tape being made to pa&s;s through between the curved &s;ide and the li&s;t, which was moderately &s;tretched and fa&s;tened by its two ends to tho&s;e of the little arch.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the machinery was all &s;o perfect, and every circum&s;tance attending the experiments of the two en&s;uing days &s;o carefully ob&s;erved, that I can with great &s;afety rely on the conclu&s;ions re&s;ulting from them. And as tho&s;e of the one day were made with leaden balls, and tho&s;e of the other with iron ones, which differ greatly in weight, every other circum&s;tance being the &s;ame, they afford very good means for di&s;co|vering the law of the different weights of &s;hot, while the variations in the powder from two to four and eight ounces furni&s;h us with the rule for the different quantities of it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="29">The fourth cour&s;e was on the 20th of July, a fine clear day. The powder was a mixture of &s;everal of the &s;orts made for government, and the balls were of lead.

<P>The uniformity of the&s;e velocities is very &s;triking, and the means with two, four, and eight ounces of powder are 613, 873, and 1162, which are in the ratio of 1, 1.424, and 1.9; the&s;e numbers are nearly in the ratio of the &s;quare roots of the quantities (2, 4, and 8) of powder, the numbers in this latter ratio being 1, 1.414, and 2, where the &s;mall difference lies chiefly in the la&s;t number. A &s;mall part of this defect in the greate&s;t velo|city is to be attributed to the mean weight of the balls u&s;ed with it being greater than in the others; for the mean weight of the balls u&s;ed with eight ounces of pow|der is 28&frac23; ounces, while that with the two and four ounces is only 28&frac13;; the reciprocal &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the&s;e is that of 1 to 1.006, in which proportion, in|crea&s;ing 1.9 the number for the greater velocity, it be|comes 1.91, which &s;till falls &s;hort of 2 by .09, which is about the 1/22d part too &s;mall for the &s;ub-duplicate ratio of
<PB N="31" REF="31">the powder. This defect of a 22d part is owing to three evident cau&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The le&s;s length of cylinder through which the ball was impelled; for by in&s;pecting the fourth column, denoting the height of the charge, it appears, that the balls lay three or four inches nearer to the muzzle of the piece with the eight ounce charge than with the others. 2. The greater quantity of ela&s;|tic fluid which e&s;caped in this ca&s;e than in the others by the windage; this happens from its moving with a greater velocity, in con&s;equence of which a greater quan|tity e&s;capes by the vent and windage than with the &s;mal|ler velocities. 3. The third cau&s;e is the greater quan|tity of powder blown out unfired in this ca&s;e than in that of the le&s;s velocities; for the ball which was im|pelled with the greater velocity would be &s;ooner out of the piece than the others, and the more &s;o as it had a le&s;s length of the bore to move through; and if powder fire in time, which cannot be denied, although indeed that time is manife&s;tly very &s;hort, a greater quantity of it mu&s;t remain unfired when the ball with the greater ve|locity i&s;&s;ues from the piece, than when that which has the le&s;s velocity goes out, and &s;till the more &s;o as the bulk of powder which was at fir&s;t to be inflamed in the one ca&s;e &s;o much exceeded that in the others. The effect, however, will ari&s;e chiefly from the fir&s;t and la&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="32">of the&s;e three cau&s;es, as that of the &s;econd will amount to very little; becau&s;e that the effect ari&s;ing from the greater velocity with which the fluid e&s;capes at the vent and windage, is partly balanced by the &s;horter time in which it acts.</P>
<P>From the above reflections we may al&s;o perceive, how &s;mall the quantity of powder is which is blown out un|fired in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, and the amazing quickne&s;s with which it fires in all ca&s;es: for although the time in which the ball pa&s;&s;ed through the barrel, when impelled by the eight ounces of powder, was not greatly different from the half only of the time in which it was impelled by the two ounces, it is evident that in half the time there was nearly four times the quantity of powder fired.</P>
<P>The fifth or la&s;t cour&s;e was on the 21&s;t of September, 1775, fine clear weather, but a little windy.</P>

</TABLE> And the&s;e mean velocities with two, four, and eight ounces of powder, are as the numbers 1, 1.416, and 1.993; but the &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the weights (two, four, and eight) of powder gives the numbers 1, 1.414, and 2, to which the others are &s;ufficiently near. It is obvious, however, that the greate&s;t difference lies in the la&s;t number which an&s;wers to the greate&s;t velocity, and which is again in defect. It will &s;till be a little more in defect if we make the allowance for the weights of the balls; for the mean weight of the balls with the two and four ounces is 18&frac34; ounces, but of the eight ounces it is 18&frac35;; dimini&s;hing therefore the number 1.993 in the reciprocal &s;ub-duplicate ratio of 18&frac35; to 18&frac34;, it be|comes 1.985, which falls &s;hort of the number 2 by .015 or the 133d part of it&s;elf; which defect is to be
<PB N="35" REF="35">attributed to the &s;ame cau&s;es as it was in the la&s;t cour&s;e of experiments before explained.</P>
<P>Let us now compare the corre&s;ponding velocities in this cour&s;e and the la&s;t.

<ROW>
<CELL>In this cour&s;e they are</CELL>

<CELL>In the la&s;t they were</CELL>

</ROW>
</TABLE> Now the ratio of the fir&s;t two numbers, or the velocities with two ounces of powder, is that of 1 to 1.1436; the ratio of the next two, is that of 1 to 1.1375; and the ratio of the la&s;t is that of 1 to 1.2022. But the mean weight of the &s;hot was, for two and four ounces of powder 28&frac13; ounces in the la&s;t cour&s;e, and 18&frac34; ounces in this; and for eight ounces of powder, it was 28&frac23; in the la&s;t, and 18&frac35; in this: taking now the reciprocal &s;ub|duplicate ratios of the&s;e weights of &s;hot, we obtain the ratio of 1 to 1.224 for that of the balls which were fired with two ounces and four ounces of powder, and the ratio of 1 to 1.241 for the balls which were fired with eight ounces. But the real ratios above found are not greatly different from the&s;e. And the variation of the actual velocities from this law of the weights of &s;hot incline the &s;ame way in this cour&s;e, as they ap|peared to do in the &s;econd cour&s;e of the&s;e experiments.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="36">We may now collect into one view the principal in|ferences that have re&s;ulted from the&s;e experiments.</P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, it is made evident by them, that powder fires almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, &s;eeing that almo&s;t the whole of the charge fires though the time be much dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The velocities communicated to balls, or &s;hot of the &s;ame weight, with different quantities of powder, are nearly in the &s;ub-duplicate ratio of tho&s;e quantities. A very &s;mall variation, in defect, taking place when the quantities of powder become great.</P>
<P N="3">3. And when &s;hot of different weights are fired with the &s;ame quantity of powder, the velocities communi|cated to them are nearly in the reciprocal &s;ub-duplicate ratio of their weights.</P>
<P N="4">4. So that, univer&s;ally, &s;hot which are of different weights, and impelled by the firing of different quanti|ties of powder, acquire velocities which are directly as the &s;quare roots of the quantities of powder, and in|ver&s;ely as the &s;quare roots of the weights of the &s;hot, nearly.</P>
<P N="5">5. It would therefore be a great improvement in ar|tillery to make u&s;e of &s;hot of a long form, or of heavier matter; for thus the momentum of a &s;hot, when fired
<PB N="37" REF="37">with the &s;ame weight of powder, would be increa&s;ed in the ratio of the &s;quare root of the weight of the &s;hot.</P>
<P N="6">6. It would al&s;o be an improvement to dimini&s;h the windage; for by &s;o doing, one-third or more of the quantity of powder might be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the improvements mentioned in the la&s;t two articles are con&s;idered as both taking place, it is evident that about half the quantity of powder might be &s;aved, which is a very con&s;iderable object. But important as this &s;aving may be, it &s;eems to be &s;till exceeded by that of the article of the guns; for thus a &s;mall gun may be made to have the effect and execution of one of two or three times its &s;ize in the pre&s;ent mode, by di&s;charging a &s;hot of two or three times the weight of its natural ball or round &s;hot. And thus a &s;mall &s;hip might di&s;charge &s;hot as heavy as tho&s;e of the greate&s;t now made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Finally, as the above experiments exhibit the regu|lations with regard to the weights of powder and balls, when fired from the &s;ame piece of ordnance, &amp;c.; &s;o by making &s;imilar experiments with a gun, varied in its length, by cutting off from it a certain part before each cour&s;e of experiments, the effects and general rules for the different lengths of guns may be certainly deter|mined by them. In &s;hort, the principles on which the&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="38">experiments were made, are &s;o fruitful in con&s;equences, that, in conjunction with the effects re&s;ulting from the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium, they &s;eem to be &s;ufficient for an&s;wering all the enquiries of the &s;peculative philo&s;o|pher, as well as tho&s;e of the practical artilleri&s;t.</P>
