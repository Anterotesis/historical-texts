<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen I &s;end you this Volume, I am rather to make you a Re|que&s;t than a Dedication. I mu&s;t de&s;ire, that if you think fit to throw away any Moments on it, you would not do it after read|ing tho&s;e excellent Pieces with which you are u&s;ually conver|&s;ant.
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
The Images which you will meet with here, will be very feint, after the Peru&s;al of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> who are your ordinary Companions. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am obliged to you for the Ta&s;te of many of their Excellencies, which I had not ob&s;erved till you pointed them to me. I am very proud that there are &s;ome Things in the&s;e Papers which I know you par|don; and it is no &s;mall Plea&s;ure to have ones Labours &s;uffered by the Judgment of a Man who &s;o well under&s;tands the true Charms of Eloquence and Poe&s;ie. But I direct this Addre&s;s to you; not that I think I can entertain you with my Writings, but to thank you for the new Delight I have from your Conver&s;ation in tho&s;e of other Men.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
May you enjoy a long Con|tinuance of the true Reli&s;h of the Happine&s;s Heaven hath be|&s;towed upon you. I know not how to &s;ay a more affectionate Thing to you, than to wi&s;h that you may be always what you are; and that you may ever think, as I know you now do, that you have a much larger For|tune than you want.

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Orlando</HI> the Fair. <HI>Chap. II.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOrtune being now propitious to the gay <HI>Or|lando,</HI> he dre&s;s'd, he &s;poke, he mov'd, as a Man might be &s;uppos'd to do in a Nation of Pigmies, and had an equal Value for our Approbation or Di&s;like. It is u&s;ual for tho&s;e who profe&s;s a Contempt of the World, to fly from it and live in Ob&s;curity; but <HI>Orlando</HI> with a greater Magnanimity, contemn'd it, and appeared in it to tell 'em &s;o. If therefore his exalted Mien met with an unwelcome Reception, he was &s;ure al|ways to double the Cau&s;e which gave the Di&s;taff. You &s;ee our Beauties affect a Negligence in the Ornament of their Hair, and adju&s;ting their Head|dre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="2" REF="6">
as con&s;cious that they adorn whatever they wear. <HI>Orlando</HI> had not only this Humour in common with other Beauties, but al&s;o had a Neglect whether Things became him or not, in a World he contemn'd. For this Rea&s;on, a noble Particularity appeared in all his Oeconomy, Furniture, and Equipage. And to convince the pre&s;ent little Race, how unequal all their Mea|&s;ures were to an <HI>Antidiluvian,</HI> as he called him&s;elf, in Re&s;pect of the In&s;ects which now appear for Men, he &s;ometimes rode in an open Tumbril, of le&s;s Size than ordinary, to &s;how the Largene&s;s of his Limbs, and the Grandeur of his Per&s;onage, to the greater Advantage: At other Sea&s;ons, all his Appoint|ments had a Magnificence, as if it were formed by the Genius of <HI>Trimalchio</HI> of old, which &s;howed it &s;elf in doing ordinary Things with an Air of Pomp and Grandeur. <HI>Orlando</HI> therefore called for Tea by Beat of Drum; his Valet got ready to &s;have him by a Trumpet to Hor&s;e; and Water was brought for his Teeth, when the Sound was changed to Boots and Saddle.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e glorious Exce&s;&s;es from the com|mon Practice, did the happy <HI>Orlando</HI> live and reign in an uninterrupted Tranquility, till an unlucky Accident brought to his Remem|brance, that one Evening he was married before he courted the Nuptials of <HI>Villaria.</HI> Several fatal <HI>Memorandums</HI> were produced to revive the Memory of this Accident, and the unhap|py Lover was for ever bani&s;hed her Pre&s;ence, to whom he owed the Support of his ju&s;t Re|nown and Gallantry. But Di&s;tre&s;s does not deba&s;e noble Minds; it only changes the Scene, and gives them new Glory by that Alteration. <HI>Orlando</HI> therefore now raves in a Garret, and calls to his Neighbour-Skies to pity his Do|lors,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
and to find Redre&s;s for an unhappy Lover. All high Spirits, in any great Agitation of Mind, are inclined to relieve them&s;elves by Poetry: The renown'd Porter of <HI>Oliver</HI> had not more Volumes around his Cell in the College of <HI>Bed|lam,</HI> than <HI>Orlando</HI> in his pre&s;ent Apartment. And though in&s;erting Poetry in the mid&s;t of Pro&s;e be thought a Licence among correct Writers not to be indulged, it is hoped the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing it, to give a ju&s;t Idea of the Hero of whom we treat, will plead for the Liberty we &s;hall hereafter take, to print <HI>Orlando</HI>'s Soliloquies in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, after the Manner of great Wits, and &s;uch as tho&s;e to whom they are nearly ally'd.</P>

<P>A good Company of us were this Day to &s;ee, or rather to hear, an artful Per&s;on do &s;everal Feats of Activity with his Throat and Wind|pipe. The fir&s;t Thing wherewith he pre&s;ent|ed us, was a Ring of Bells, which he imitated in a mo&s;t miraculous Manner; after that, he gave us all the different Notes of a Pack of Hounds, to our great Delight and A&s;to|ni&s;hment. The Company expre&s;&s;ed their Ap|plau&s;e with much Noi&s;e; and never was heard &s;uch an Harmony of Men and Dogs: But a certain plump merry Fellow, from an Angle of the Room, fell a crowing like a Cock &s;o ingeniou&s;ly, that he won our Hearts from the other Operator in an In&s;tant. As &s;oon as I &s;aw him, I recollected I had &s;een him on the Stage, and immediately knew it to be <HI>Tom. Mirrour,</HI> the Comical Actor. He immediately addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and told me, he was &s;urprized to &s;ee a Virtuo&s;o take Satisfaction in any Repre&s;entations below that of humane Life; and asked me, Whether I
<PB N="4" REF="8">
thought this acting Bells and Dogs was to be con&s;idered under the Notion of Wit, Humour, or Satyr? Were it not better, continued he, to have &s;ome particular Picture of Man laid before your Eyes, that might incite your Laughter? He had no &s;ooner &s;poke the Word, but he im|mediately quitted his natural Shape, and talked to me in a very different Air and Tone from what he had u&s;ed before; upon which all that &s;ate near us laughed; but I &s;aw no Di&s;tortion in his Countenance, or any Thing that appeared to me di&s;agreeable. I asked <HI>Pacolet,</HI> What meant that &s;udden Whi&s;per about us? For I could not take the Je&s;t. He an&s;wered, The Gentleman you were talking to, a&s;&s;umed your Air and Countenance &s;o exactly, that all fell a laughing to &s;ee how little you knew your &s;elf, and how much you were enamoured with your own Image. But that Per&s;on, (continu|ed my Monitor) if Men would make the right U&s;e of him, might be as In&s;trumental to their reforming Errors in Ge&s;ture, Language, and Speech, as a Dancing-Ma&s;ter, Lingui&s;t, or O|rator. You &s;ee he laid your &s;elf before you with &s;o much Addre&s;s, that you &s;aw nothing particular in his Behaviour: He has &s;o happy a Knack of repre&s;enting Errors and Imperfections, that you can bear your Faults in him as well as in your &s;elf: He is the fir&s;t Mimick that ever gave the Beauties, as well as the Deformities, of the Man he acted. What Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;aid of a very great Man, may be well applied to him:
<Q><L>He is</L>
<L>Not one, but all Mankind's Epitome.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">
You are to know, that this <HI>Pantomime</HI> may be &s;aid to be a Species of him&s;elf: He has no Commerce with the re&s;t of Mankind, but as they are the Objects of Imitation; like the <HI>Indian</HI> Fowl, called the <HI>Mock-Bird,</HI> who has no Note of his own, but hits every Sound in the Wood as &s;oon as he hears it; &s;o that <HI>Mirrour</HI> is at once a Copy and an Original. Poor <HI>Mirrour</HI>'s Fate (as well as Talent) is like that of the Bird we ju&s;t now &s;poke of: The Nightingale, the Linnet, the Lark, are delighted with his Company; but the Buz|zard, the Crow, and the Owl, are ob&s;erved to be his mortal Enemies. Whenever <HI>Sophro|nius</HI> meets <HI>Mirrour,</HI> he receives him with Ci|vility and Re&s;pect, and well knows, a good Copy of him&s;elf can be no Injury to him; but <HI>Bathillus</HI> &s;huns the Secret where he ex|pects to meet him; for he that knows his every Step and Look is con&s;trained and affect|ed, mu&s;t be afraid to be rival'd in his Action, and of having it di&s;covered to be unnatural, by its being practi&s;ed by another as well as him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Letters from <HI>Coventry</HI> and other Places have been &s;ent to me, in An&s;wer to what I have &s;aid in Relation to my Antagoni&s;t Mr. <HI>Powell,</HI> and advi&s;e me, with warm Language, to keep to Subjects more proper for me than &s;uch high Points. But the Writers of the&s;e Epi|&s;tles mi&s;take the U&s;e and Service I propo&s;e to the learned World by &s;uch Ob&s;ervations: For you are to under&s;tand. That the Title of this Paper gives me a Right in taking to my &s;elf, and in&s;erting in it, all &s;uch Parts of any Book or Letter which are foreign to the Purpo&s;e intended, or profe&s;&s;ed by the Writer:
<PB N="6" REF="10">
So that &s;uppo&s;e Two great Divines &s;hould ar|gue, and treat each other with Warmth and Le|vity unbecoming their Subject or Character, all that they &s;ay unfit for that Place is very proper to be in&s;erted here. Therefore from Time to Time, in all Writings which &s;hall here|after be publi&s;hed, you &s;hall have from me Extracts of all that &s;hall appear not to the Purpo&s;e; and for the Benefit of the gentle Reader, I will &s;how what to turn over un|read, and what to peru&s;e. For this End I have a Mathematical Sive preparing, in which I will &s;ift every Page and Paragraph; and all that falls through, I &s;hall make bold with for my own U&s;e. The &s;ame Thing will be as beneficial in Speech; for all &s;uperfluous Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in Talk fall to me al&s;o: As, when a Pleader at the Bar de&s;igns to be extremely impertinent and trouble&s;ome, and cries, <HI>Un|der Favour of the Court&mdash;With Submi&s;&s;ion, my Lord&mdash;I humbly offer&mdash;</HI>and, <HI>I think I have well con&s;idered this Matter; for I would be very far from trifling with your Lord&s;hip's Time, or tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon your Patience&mdash;How|ever, thus I will venture to &s;ay&mdash;</HI>and &s;o forth. Or el&s;e, when a &s;ufficient &s;elf-conceited Coxcomb is bringing out &s;omething in his own Prai&s;e, and begins, <HI>Without Vanity,</HI> I mu&s;t take this upon me to a&s;&s;ert. There is al&s;o a Trick which the Fair Sex have, that will great|ly contribute to &s;welling my Volumes: As, when a Woman is going to abu&s;e her be&s;t Friend, <HI>Pray</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>have you heard what I &s;aid of Mrs. &s;uch a one? I am hear|tily &s;orry to hear any Thing of that Kind, of one I have &s;o great a Value for; but they make no Scruple of telling it; and it was not &s;poken of to me as a Secret, for now all the Town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ings of it.</HI> All &s;uch Flowers in Rhetorick,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and little Refuges for Malice, are to be noted, and naturally belong only to Tatlers. By this Me|thod you will immediately find Volumes contract them&s;elves into Octavo's; and the Labour of a Fortnight got over in half a Day.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Delamira</HI> re&s;igns her Fan.</HEAD>
<P>LOng had the Crowd of the Gay and Young &s;tood in Su&s;pence as to their Fate in their Pa&s;&s;ion to the beauteous <HI>Delamira;</HI> but all their Hopes are lately vani&s;hed, by the Declaration that &s;he has made of her Choice, to take the happy <HI>Archibald</HI> for her Companion for Life. Upon her making this known, the Expence of Sweet Powder and Je&s;&s;amine are con&s;iderably a|bated; and the Mercers and Milleners complain of her Want of publick Spirit, in not concealing longer a Secret which was &s;o much the Benefit of Trade. But &s;o it has happened; and no one was in Confidence with her in carrying on this Treaty but the matchle&s;s <HI>Virgulta,</HI> who&s;e De|&s;pair of ever entring the Matrimonial State, made her, &s;ome Nights before <HI>Delamira</HI>'s Re&s;olution was publi&s;h'd to the World, addre&s;s her &s;elf to her in the following Manner:</P>
<Q><HI>Delamira,</HI> You are now going into that State of Life, wherein the U&s;e of your Charms is wholly to be applied to the plea&s;ing only one Man. That &s;wimming Air of your Body; that janty bearing of your Head over one Shoulder; and that inex|pre&s;&s;ible Beauty in your Manner of playing your Fan, mu&s;t be lower'd into a more confin'd Behavi|our; to &s;how, That you would rather &s;hun than receive Addre&s;&s;es for the future. Therefore, dear <HI>Delamira,</HI> give me tho&s;e Excellencies you leave off,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
and acquaint me with your Manner of Charming: For I take the Liberty of your Friend&s;hip to &s;ay, That when I con&s;ider my own Stature, Motion, Com|plexion, Wit or Breeding, I cannot think my &s;elf any Way your Inferior; yet do I go through Crowds without wounding a Man, and all my Acquaintance marry round me, while I live a Virgin unask'd, and (I think) unregarded.</Q>
<P><HI>Delamira</HI> heard her with great Attention, and with that Dexterity which is natural to her, told her, That all &s;he had above the re&s;t of her Sex and contemporary Beauties was wholly ow|ing to a Fan (which was left her by her Mother, and had been long in the Family) which who|ever had in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and u&s;ed with Skill, &s;hould command the Hearts of all her Behold|ers: And &s;ince (&s;aid &s;he &s;miling) I have no more to do with extending my Conque&s;ts or Tri|umphs, I'll make you a Pre&s;ent of this ine&s;tima|ble Rarity. <HI>Virgulta</HI> made her Expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t Gratitude for &s;o uncommon a Confidence in her, and de&s;ired &s;he would &s;how her what was peculiar in the Management of that Uten&s;il, which render'd it of &s;uch general Force while &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of it. <HI>Delamira</HI> reply'd, You &s;ee, Madam, <HI>Cupid</HI> is the principal Figure painted on it; and the Skill in play|ing this Fan is, in your &s;everal Motions of it, to let him appear as little as po&s;&s;ible; for ho|nourable Lovers fly all Endeavours to en&s;nare 'em; and your <HI>Cupid</HI> mu&s;t hide his Bow and Arrow, or he'll never be &s;ure of his Game. You may ob&s;erve, continued &s;he, That in all publick A&s;&s;emblies, the Sexes &s;eem to &s;eparate them|&s;elves, and draw up to attack each other with Eye-&s;hot: That is the Time when the Fan, which is all the Armour of Woman, is of mo&s;t U&s;e in our Defence; for our Minds are con&s;tru|ed
<PB N="10" REF="14">
by the waving of that little In&s;trument, and our Thoughts appear in Compo&s;ure or Agitation according to the Motion of it. You may ob&s;erve, when <HI>Will. Peregrine</HI> comes into the Side Box, Mi&s;s <HI>Gatty</HI> flutters her Fan as a Fly does its Wings round a Candle; while her elder Si&s;ter, who is as much in Love with him as &s;he is, is as grave as a Ve&s;tal at his Entrance. and the Con&s;e|quence is accordingly. He watches half the Play for a Glance from her Si&s;ter, while <HI>Gatty</HI> is over|looked and neglected. I wi&s;h you heartily as much Succe&s;s in the Management of it as I have had: If you think fit to go on where I left off, I will give you a &s;hort Account of the Execution I have made with it.</P>
<P><HI>Cimon,</HI> who is the dulle&s;t of Mortals, and tho' a wonderful great Scholar, does not only pau&s;e, but &s;eems to take a Nap with his Eyes open be|tween every other Sentence in his Di&s;cour&s;e: Him have I made a Leader in A&s;&s;emblies; and one Blow on the Shoulder as I pa&s;&s;ed by him, has rai&s;ed him to a downright Impertinent in all Conver&s;ations. The airy <HI>Will. Sampler</HI> is become a Lethargick by this my Wand, as <HI>Ci|mon</HI> is &s;prightly. Take it, good Girl, and u&s;e it without Mercy; for the Reign of Beauty never la&s;ted full Three Years, but it ended in Mar|riage, or Condemnation to Virginity. As you fear therefore the one, and hope for the other, I expect an Hourly Journal of your Triumphs; for I have it by certain Tradition, that it was given to the fir&s;t who wore it by an Inchantre&s;s, with this remarkable Power, That it be&s;tows a Husband in half a Year to her who does not over-look her proper Minute; but a&s;&s;igns to a long De&s;pair the Woman who is well offered, and neglects that Propo&s;al. May Occa&s;ion at|tend your Charms, and your Charms &s;lip no Occa&s;ion. Give me, I &s;ay, an Account of the
<PB N="11" REF="15">
Progre&s;s of your Forces at our next Meeting; and you &s;hall hear what I think of my new Con|dition. I &s;hould meet my future Spou&s;e this Mo|ment. Farewel. Live in ju&s;t Terror of the dread|ful Words, SHE WAS.</P>

<P>I had the Honour this Evening to vi&s;it &s;ome Ladies, where the Subject of the Conver&s;ation was <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> which they commended as a Qua|lity quite as becoming in Men as in Women. I took the Liberty to &s;ay, It might be as beauti|ful in our Behaviour as in theirs, yet it could nee be &s;aid, it was as &s;ucce&s;sful in Life; for as it was the only Recommendation in them, &s;o it was the greate&s;t Ob&s;tacle to us both in Love and Bu&s;ine&s;s. A Gentleman pre&s;ent was of my Mind, and &s;aid, That we mu&s;t de&s;cribe the Difference between the Mode&s;ty of Women and that of Men, or we &s;hould be confounded in our Rea&s;onings upon it; for this Virtue is to be regarded with Regard to our different Ways of Life. The Woman's Province is to be careful in her Oeconomy, and cha&s;t in her Affection: The Man's, to be active in the Improvement of his Fortune, and ready to undertake whatever is con&s;i&s;tent with his Reputation for that End. Mode&s;ty therefore in a Woman has a certain a|greeable Fear in all &s;he enters upon; and in Men it is compo&s;ed of a right Judgment of what is proper for them to attempt. From hence it is, that a di&s;creet Man is always a mo|de&s;t one. It is to be noted, That Mode&s;ty in a Man is never to be allowed as a good Quality, but a Weakne&s;s, if it &s;uppre&s;&s;es his Virtue, and hides it from the World, when he has at the &s;ame Time a Mind to exert him&s;elf. A <HI>French</HI> Author &s;ays very ju&s;tly, That Mode&s;ty is to the other Virtues in a Man, what Shade in a Picture is to the Parts of the Thing repre&s;ented. It
<PB N="12" REF="16">
makes all the Beauties con&s;picuous, which would otherwi&s;e be but a wild Heap of Colours. This Shade on our Actions mu&s;t therefore be very ju&s;t|ly applied; for if there be too much, it hides our good Qualities, in&s;tead of &s;howing them to Ad|vantage.</P>
<P><HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in <HI>Athens</HI> was an unhappy In&s;tance of this Truth; for he was not only in his Profe&s;&s;ion the greate&s;t Man of that Age, but had given more Proofs of it than any other Man ever did; yet for Want of that natural Freedom and Audacity which is nece&s;&s;ary in Commerce with Men, his per&s;onal Mode&s;ty overthrew all his publick A|ctions. <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> was in tho&s;e Days a skilful Ar|chitect, and in a Manner the Inventor of the U&s;e of Mechanick Powers, which he brought to &s;o great Perfection, that he knew to an Atom what Foundation would bear &s;uch a Super&s;tructure: And they record of him, That he was &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly exact, that for the Experiment-&s;ake, he built an Edifice of great Beauty, and &s;eeming Strength; but contrived &s;o as to bear only its own Weight, and not to admit the Addition of the lea&s;t Particle. This Building was beheld with much Admiration by all the Virtuo&s;i of that Time; but fell down with no other Pre&s;&s;ure, but the &s;ettling of a <HI>Wren</HI> upon the Top of it: Yet <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI>'s Mode&s;ty was &s;uch, that his Art and Skill were &s;oon di&s;regarded, for Want of that Manner with which Men of the World &s;upport and a&s;|&s;ert the Merit of their own Performances. Soon after this In&s;tance of his Art, <HI>Athens</HI> was, by the Treachery of its Enemies, burnt to the Ground. This gave <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion that ever Builder had to render his Name im|mortal, and his Per&s;on venerable: For all the new City ro&s;e according to his Di&s;po&s;ition, and all the Monuments of the Glories and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that People were erected by that &s;ole Arti&s;t:
<PB N="13" REF="17">
Nay, all their Temples, as well as Hou&s;es, were the Effects of his Study and Labour; in&s;omuch, that it was &s;aid by an old Sage, Sure, <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> will now be famous; for the Habitations of Gods, as well as Men, are built by his Contrivance. But this ba&s;hful Quality &s;till put a Damp upon his great Knowledge, which has as fatal an Effect upon Men's Reputations as Poverty; for as it was &s;aid, The poor Man &s;aved the City, and the poor Man's Labour was forgot; &s;o here we find, The mode&s;t Man built the City, and the mode&s;t Man's Skill was unknown.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee every Man is the Maker of his own Fortune; and what is very odd to con&s;ider, he mu&s;t in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be the Trumpet of his Fame: Not that Men are to be tolerated who directly prai&s;e them&s;elves, but they are to be endued with a Sort of defen&s;ive Eloquence, by which they &s;hall be always capable of expre&s;&s;ing the Rules and Arts by which they govern them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Varillus</HI> was the Man of all I have read of the happie&s;t in the true Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Quality of Mode&s;ty. My Author &s;ays of him, Mode&s;ty in <HI>Varillus</HI> is really a Virtue; for it is a voluntary Quality, and the Effect of good Sen&s;e. He is naturally bold and enterpri&s;ing; but &s;o ju&s;tly di&s;creet, that he never acts or &s;peaks any Thing, but tho&s;e who behold him know he has for|born much more than he has performed or utter'd, out of Deference to the Per&s;ons before whom he is. This makes <HI>Varillus</HI> truly amiable, and all his Attempts &s;ucce&s;sful; for as bad as the World is thought to be by tho&s;e who are perhaps uaskill'd in it, Want of Succe&s;s in our Actions is generally owing to Want of Judgment in what we ought to attempt, or a ru&s;tick Mo|de&s;ty which will not give us Leave to under|take
<PB N="14" REF="18">
what we ought. But how unfortunate this diffident Temper is to tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it, may be be&s;t &s;een in the Succe&s;s of &s;uch as are wholly unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>We have one peculiar Elegance in our Lan|guage above all others, which is con&s;picuous in the Term <HI>Fellow.</HI> This Word added to any of our Adjectives, extremely varies, or quite alters the Sen&s;e of that with which it is joined. Thus, though a mode&s;t Man is the mo&s;t unfortunate of all Men, yet a mode&s;t Fellow is as &s;uperlatively happy. A mode&s;t Fellow is a ready Creature, who with great Humility, and as great Forward|ne&s;s, vi&s;its his Patrons at all Hours, and meets 'em in all Places, and has &s;o moderate an Opi|nion of him&s;elf, that he makes his Court at large. If you won't give him a great Employment, he will be glad of a little one. He has &s;o great a Deference for his Benefactor's Judgment, that as he thinks him&s;elf fit for any Thing he can get, &s;o he is above nothing which is offered. He is like the young Batchelor of Arts, who came to Town recommended to a Chaplain's Place; but none being vacant, mode&s;tly accepted of that of a Po&s;tillion.</P>
<P>We have very many con&s;picuous Per&s;ons of this undertaking yet mode&s;t Turn: I have a Grand&s;on who is very happy in this Quality: I &s;ent him in the Time of the la&s;t Peace into <HI>France.</HI> As &s;oon as he landed at <HI>Calais,</HI> he &s;ent me an exact Account of the Nature of the People, and the Policies of the King of <HI>France.</HI> I got him &s;ince cho&s;en a Member of a Corporation: The mode&s;t Creature, as &s;oon as he came into the Common Council, told a Senior Burge&s;s, he was perfectly out in the Orders of their Hou&s;e. In other Circum&s;tances, he is &s;o thoroughly mode&s;t a Fellow, that he &s;eems to pretend only to Things he under&s;tands. He is a Citizen only at
<PB N="15" REF="19">
Court, and in the City a Courtier. In a Word, to &s;peak the Characteri&s;tical Difference between a Mode&s;t Man and a Mode&s;t Fellow; the mode&s;t Man is in Doubt in all his Actions; a mode&s;t Fellow never has a Doubt from his Cradle to his Grave.</P>

<P>THE Fate and Character of the incon&s;tant <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> is a ju&s;t Excu&s;e for the little No|tice taken by his Widow, of his Departure out of this Life, which was equally trouble&s;ome to <HI>Elmira</HI> his faithful Spou&s;e, and to him&s;elf. That Life pa&s;&s;ed between 'em after this Manner, is the Rea&s;on the Town has ju&s;t now received a Lady with all that Gaiety, after having been a Relict but Three Months, which other Women hardly a&s;&s;ume under Fifteen after &s;uch a Di&s;a|&s;ter. <HI>Elmira</HI> is the Daughter of a rich and worthy Citizen, who gave her to <HI>O&s;myn</HI> with a Portion which might have obtained her an Al|liance with our noble&s;t Hou&s;es, and fixed her in the Eye of the World, where her Story had not been now to be related: For her good Qualities had made her the Object of univer&s;al E&s;teem among the polite Part of Mankind, from whom &s;he has been bani&s;h'd and immur'd till the Death of her Gaoler. It is now full Fifteen Years &s;ince that beauteous Lady was given into the Hands of the happy <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> who in the Sen&s;e of all the World received at that Time a
<PB N="16" REF="20">
Pre&s;ent more valuable than the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both the <HI>Indies.</HI> She was then in her early Bloom, with an Under&s;tanding and Di&s;cretion very little inferior to the mo&s;t experienced Matrons. She was not beholden to the Charms of her Sex, that her Company was preferable to any <HI>O&s;myn</HI> could meet with abroad; for were all &s;he &s;aid con&s;idered, without Regard to her being a Wo|man, it might &s;tand the Examination of the &s;e|vere&s;t Judges. She had all the Beauty of her own Sex, with all the Conver&s;ation-Accompli&s;hments of ours.</P>
<P>But <HI>O&s;myn</HI> very &s;oon grew &s;urfeited with the Charms of her Per&s;on by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of her Mind by Want of Ta&s;te; for he was one of that loo&s;e Sort of Men, who have but one Rea&s;on for &s;etting any Value upon the fair Sex, who con&s;ider even Brides but as new Women, and con&s;equent|ly neglect 'em when they cea&s;e to be &s;uch. All the Merit of <HI>Elmira</HI> could not prevent her be|coming a meer Wife within few Months after her Nuptials; and <HI>O&s;myn</HI> had &s;o little Reli&s;h for her Conver&s;ation, that he complained of the Advantages of it. My Spou&s;e (&s;aid he to one of his Companions) is &s;o very di&s;creet, &s;o good, &s;o virtuous, and I know not what, that I think her Per&s;on is rather the Object of E&s;teem than of Love; and there is &s;uch a Thing as a Merit, which cau&s;es rather Di&s;tance than Pa&s;&s;ion. But there being no <HI>Medium</HI> in the State of Matrimo|ny, their Life began to take the u&s;ual Gradations to become the mo&s;t irk&s;ome of all Beings. They grew in the fir&s;t Place very complai&s;ant; and having at Heart a certain Knowledge that they were indifferent to each other, Apologies were made for every little Circum&s;tance which they thought betray'd their mutual Coldne&s;s. This la&s;ted but few Months, when they &s;howed a Difference of Opinion in every Trifle; and,
<PB N="17" REF="21">
as a Sign of certain Decay of Affection, the Word <HI>Perhaps</HI> was introduced in all their Di&s;|cour&s;e. <HI>I have a Mind to go to the Park,</HI> &s;ays &s;he; <HI>but</HI> perhaps, <HI>my Dear, you will want the Coach on &s;ome other Occa&s;ion. He would very wil|lingly carry her to the Play; but</HI> perhaps, <HI>&s;he had rather go to Lady</HI> Centaure<HI>'s and play at</HI> Ombre. They were both Per&s;ons of good Di&s;cerning, and &s;oon found that they mortally hated each other, by their Manner of hiding it. Certain it is, that there are &s;ome Genio's which are not capa|ble of pure Affection, and a Man is born with Talents for it as much as for Poetry or any other Science.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;myn</HI> began too late to find the Imperfection of his own Heart, and u&s;ed all the Methods in the World to correct it, and argue him&s;elf into Return of De&s;ire and Pa&s;&s;ion for his Wife, by the Contemplation of her excellent Qualities, his great Obligations to her, and the high Value he &s;aw all the World except him&s;elf did put upon her. But &s;uch is Man's unhappy Condition, that tho' the Weakne&s;s of the Heart has a prevailing Power over the Strength of the Head, yet the Strength of the Head has but &s;mall Force again&s;t the Weakne&s;s of the Heart. <HI>O&s;myn</HI> therefore &s;truggled in vain to revive departed De&s;ire; and for that Rea&s;on re&s;olved to retire to one of his E&s;tates in the Country, and pa&s;s away his Hours of Wedlock in the noble Diver&s;ions of the Field; and in the Fury of a di&s;appointed Lover, made an Oath, to leave neither Stag, Fox, or Hare li|ving, during the Days of his Wife. Be&s;ides, that Country Sports would be an Amu&s;ement, he ho|ped al&s;o, that his Spou&s;e would be half killed by the very Sen&s;e of &s;eeing this Town no more, and would think her Life ended as &s;oon as &s;he left it. He communicated his De&s;ign to <HI>Elmira,</HI> who re|ceived it (as now &s;he did all Things) like a Per|&s;on
<PB N="18" REF="22">
too unhappy to be relieved or afflicted by the Circum&s;tance of Place. This unexpected Re&s;ig|nation made <HI>O&s;myn</HI> re&s;olve to be as obliging to her as po&s;&s;ible; and if he could not prevail upon him&s;elf to be kind, he took a Re&s;olution at lea&s;t to act &s;incerely, and communicate frankly to her the Weakne&s;s of his Temper, to excu&s;e the Indifference of his Behaviour. He di&s;po&s;ed his Hou&s;hold in the Way to <HI>Rutland,</HI> &s;o as he and his Lady travelled only in the Coach for the Con|venience of Di&s;cour&s;e. They had not gone many Miles out of Town, when <HI>O&s;myn</HI> &s;poke to this Purpo&s;e:</P>
<Q><HI>My Dear,</HI> I believe I look quite as &s;illy, now I am going to tell you I do not love you, as when I fir&s;t told you I did. We are now going into the Country together, with only one Hope for making this Life agreeable, Survivor&s;hip: De&s;ire is not in our Power; mine is all gone for you. What &s;hall we do to carry it with Decency to the World, and hate one another with Di&s;cretien?</Q>
<P>The Lady an&s;wered without the lea&s;t Ob&s;erva|tion on the Extravagance of his Speech:</P>
<Q><HI>My Dear,</HI> You have lived mo&s;t of your Days in a Court, and I have not been wholly unacquainted with that Sort of Life. In Courts, you &s;ee Good|will is &s;poken with great Warmth, Ill-will covered with great Civility. Men are long in Civilities to tho&s;e they hate, and &s;hort in Expre&s;&s;ions of Kind|ne&s;s to tho&s;e they love. Therefore, my Dear, let us be well-bred &s;till, and it is no matter, as to all who &s;ee us, whether we love or hate: And to let you &s;ee how much you are beholden to me for my Conduct, I have both hated and de&s;pi&s;ed you, my Dear, this half Year; and yet neither in Lan|guage or Behaviour has it been vi&s;ible but that I
<PB N="19" REF="23">
loved you tenderly. Therefore, as I know you go out of Town to divert Life in Pur&s;uit of Bea&s;ts, and Conver&s;ation with Men ju&s;t above 'em; &s;o, my Life, from this Moment, I &s;hall read all the learned Cooks who have ever writ, &s;tudy Broths, Plai&s;ters, and Con&s;erves, till from a Fine Lady I become a Notable Woman. We mu&s;t take our Minds a Note or two lower, or we &s;hall be tortur'd by Jealou&s;y or Anger. Thus I am re&s;olved to kill all keen Pa&s;&s;ions by employing my Mind on little Subjects, and le&s;&s;ening the Ea&s;ine&s;s of my Spirit; while you, my Dear, with much Ale, Exerci&s;e, and ill Company, are &s;o good, as to endeavour to be as contemptible as it is nece&s;&s;ary for my Quiet I &s;hould think you.</Q>
<P>To <HI>Rutland</HI> they arrived, and lived with great, but &s;ecret Impatience for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Years, till <HI>O&s;mrn</HI> thought of an happy Expedient to give their Affairs a new Turn. One Day he took <HI>El|mira</HI> a&s;ide, and &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><HI>My Dear,</HI> You &s;ee here the Air is &s;o temperate and &s;erene, the Rivulets, the Groves, and Soil, &s;o extremely kind to Nature, that we are &s;tronger and firmer in our Health &s;ince we left the Towns; &s;o that there is no Hope of a Relea&s;e in this Place: But if you will be &s;o kind as to go with me to my E&s;tate in the Hundreds of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome kind Damp may one Day or other re|lieve us. If you will conde&s;cend to accept of this Offer, I will add that whole E&s;tate to your Jointure in this County.</Q>
<P><HI>Elmira,</HI> who was all Goodne&s;s, accepted the Offer, removed accordingly, and has left her Spou&s;e in that Place to re&s;t with his Fathers.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="24">
This is the real Figure in which <HI>Elmira</HI> ought to be beheld in this Town, and not thought guilty of an Indecorum, in not profe&s;&s;ing the Sen&s;e, or bearing the Habit of Sorrow, for one who robbed her of all the Endearments of Life, and gave her only common Civility, in&s;tead of Complacency of Manners, Dignity of Pa&s;&s;ion, and that con&s;tant A&s;&s;emblage of &s;oft De&s;ires and Affections which all feel who love, but none can expre&s;s.</P>

In the Tragedy of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> he introduces his Hero in his Night-Gown.

<HEAD>Of the Government of Affection.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Labour was pronounced to be the Portion of Man, that Doom reach|ed the Affections of his Mind, as well as his Per&s;on, the Matter on which he was to feed, and all the animal and vegetable World about him. There is therefore an a&s;&s;iduous Care and Cultivation to be be&s;towed upon our Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections; for they, as they are the Ex|cre&s;cencies of our Souls, like our Hair and Beards, look horrid or becoming, as we cut or let 'em grow. All this grave Preface is meant to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on in Nature for the unaccoun|table Behaviour of <HI>Duumvir,</HI> the Husband and Keeper. Ten Thou&s;and Follies had this unhap|py Man e&s;caped, had he made a Compact with him&s;elf to be upon his Guard, and not permit|ted his vagrant Eye to let in &s;o many different Inclinations upon him, as all his Days he has been perplexed with. But indeed at pre&s;ent he has brought him&s;elf to be confined only to one prevailing Mi&s;tre&s;s; between whom and his Wife, <HI>Duumvir</HI> pa&s;&s;es his Hours in all the Vi|ci&s;&s;itudes which attend Pa&s;&s;ion and Affection, without the Intervention of Rea&s;on. <HI>Laura</HI> his Wife, and <HI>Phillis</HI> his Mi&s;tre&s;s, are all with whom he has had, for &s;ome Months, the lea&s;t amorous Commerce. <HI>Duumvir</HI> has pa&s;&s;ed the Noon of Life; but cannot withdraw from tho&s;e Enter|tainments
<PB N="24" REF="28">
which are pardonable only before that Stage of our Being, and which after that Sea&s;on are rather Puni&s;hments than Satisfactions: For pall'd Appetite is humorous, and mu&s;t be grati|fied with Sauces rather than Food. For which End <HI>Duumvir</HI> is provided with an haughty, imperious, expen&s;ive, and fanta&s;tick Mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom he retires from the Conver&s;ation of an affable, humble, di&s;crect, and affectionate Wife. <HI>Laura</HI> receives him after Ab&s;ence with an ea&s;ie and unaffected Complacency; but that he calls in&s;ipid: <HI>Phillis</HI> rates him for his Ab&s;ence, and bids him return from whence he came: This he calls Spirit and Fire. <HI>Laura</HI>'s Gentlene&s;s is thought mean; <HI>Phillis</HI>'s In&s;olence, &s;prightly. Were you to &s;ee him at his own Home, and his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Lodgings, to <HI>Phillis</HI> he appears an ob|&s;equious Lover, to <HI>Laura</HI> an imperious Ma|&s;ter. Nay, &s;o unju&s;t is the Ta&s;te of <HI>Duumvir,</HI> that he owns <HI>Laura</HI> has no ill Quality, but that &s;he is his Wife; <HI>Phillis</HI> no good one, but that &s;he is his Mi&s;tre&s;s. And he has him&s;elf often &s;aid, were he married to any one el&s;e, he would rather keep <HI>Laura</HI> than any Woman li|ving; yet allows at the &s;ame Time, that <HI>Phillis,</HI> were &s;he a Woman of Honour, would have been the mo&s;t in&s;ipid Animal breathing. The other Day <HI>Laura,</HI> who has a Voice like an An|gel, began to &s;ing to him: Fie Madam, he cry'd, we mu&s;t be pa&s;t all the&s;e Gaieties. <HI>Phillis</HI> has a Note as rude and as loud as that of a Milk-Maid: When &s;he begins to warble; Well, &s;ays he, There is &s;uch a plea&s;ing Simplicity in all that Wench does&mdash;In a Word, the affectionate Part of his Heart being corrupted, and his true Ta&s;te that Way wholly lo&s;t, he has contracted a Prejudice to all the Behaviour of <HI>Laura,</HI> and a general Partiality in Favour of <HI>Phillis.</HI> It is not in the Power of the Wife to

My &s;elf, and a great many good People who frequent the Divine Service at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, have been a long Time &s;candaliz'd by the imprudent Conduct of <HI>Stentor</HI> in that Cathedral.

This is a Grievance which, to my certain Knowledge, &s;everal worthy People de|&s;ire to &s;ee redre&s;s'd; and if by in&s;erting this Epi&s;tle in your Paper, or by repre&s;enting the Matter your own Way, you can convince <HI>Stentor,</HI> that Di&s;cord in a Choir is the &s;ame Sin that Schi&s;m is in the Church in general, you would lay a great Obligation upon us, and make &s;ome Atonement for certain of your Paragraphs which have not been highly approved by us.

<P>THis Office, which has had its Share in the im|partial Ju&s;tice of your Cen&s;ures, demands at pre|&s;ent your Vindication of their Rights and Privile|ges. There are certain Hours when our young Heralds

<P>There have been communicated to me &s;ome o|ther ill Con&s;equences from the &s;ame Cau&s;e; as, the overturning of Coaches by &s;udden Starts of the Hor&s;es as they pa&s;s'd that Way, Women pregnant frighten'd, and Heirs to Families lo&s;t; which are Publick Di&s;a&s;ters, though ari&s;ing from a good In|tention: But it is hoped, after this Admonition, that <HI>Stentor</HI> will aviod an Act of &s;o great Super|crogation, as &s;inging without a Voice.</P>
<P>But I am diverted from pro&s;ecuting <HI>Stentor</HI>'s Reformation, by an Account, That the Two faith|ful Lovers, <HI>Li&s;ander</HI> and <HI>Coriana,</HI> are dead; for no longer ago than the fir&s;t of the la&s;t Month they &s;wore eternal Fidelity to each other, and to love till Death.

<P>WHILE others are bu&s;ied in Relations which concern the Intere&s;ts of Princes, the Peace of Nations, and the Revolutions of Em|pire, I think (though the&s;e are very great Sub|jects) my Theme of Di&s;cour&s;e is &s;ometimes to be of Matters of a yet higher Con&s;ideration. The &s;low Steps of Providence and Nature, and &s;trange Events which are brought about in an In&s;tant, are what, as they come within our View and Ob&s;ervation, &s;hall be given to the Publick. Such Things are not accompanied with Show and Noi&s;e, and therefore &s;eldom draw the Eyes of the unattentive Part of Mankind; but are very proper at once to exerci&s;e our Humanity, plea&s;e our Imaginations, and improve our Judg|ments. It may not therefore be unu&s;eful to re|late many Circum&s;tances, which were ob&s;erva|ble upon a late Cure done upon a young Gentle|man who was born blind, and on the 29th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t received his Sight at the Age of Twen|ty Years, by the Operation of an Oculi&s;t. This happened no farther off than <HI>Newington,</HI> and the Work was prepar'd for in the following Man|ner.</P>
<P>The Operator, Mr. <HI>Grant,</HI> having ob&s;erved the Eyes of his Patient, and convinced his Friends and Relations, among others the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ca&s;well</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Place, that it was highly probable
<PB N="30" REF="34">
he &s;hould remove the Ob&s;tacle which prevented the U&s;e of his Sight; all his Acquaintance, who had any Regard for the young Man, or Curio&s;ity to be pre&s;ent when one of full Age and Under|&s;tanding received a new Sen&s;e, a&s;&s;embled them|&s;elves on this Occa&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Ca&s;well</HI> being a Gen|tleman particularly curious, de&s;ired the whole Company, in ca&s;e the Blindne&s;s &s;hould be cured, to keep Silence, and let the Patient make his own Ob&s;ervations, without the Direction of any Thing he had received by his other Sen&s;es, or the Advantage of di&s;covering his Friends by their Voices. Among &s;everal others, the Mother, Brethren, Si&s;ters, and a young Gentle|woman for whom he had a Pa&s;&s;ion, were pre|&s;ent. The Work was performed with great Skill and Dexterity. When the Patient fir&s;t re|ceived the Dawn of Light, there appeared &s;uch an Extacy in his Action, that he &s;eemed ready to &s;weon away in the Surprize of Joy and Won|der. The Surgeon &s;tood before him with his In&s;truments in his Hand. The young Man ob|&s;erved him from Head to Foot; after which he &s;urveyed him&s;elf as carefully, and &s;eem'd to compare him to him&s;elf; and ob&s;erving both their Hands, &s;eem'd to think they were exactly alike, except the In&s;truments, which he took for Parts of his Hands. When he had conti|nued in this Amazement &s;ome Time, his Mo|ther could not longer bear the Agitations of &s;o many Pa&s;&s;ions as throng'd upon her, but fell upon his Neck, crying out, My Son! My Son! The Youth knew her Voice, and could &s;peak no more than, Oh me! Are you my Mother? and fainted. The whole Room, you will ea&s;ily conceive, were very affectionately employed in recovering him; but above all, the young Gen|tlewoman who loved him, and whom he loved, &s;hreik'd in the loude&s;t Manner. That
<PB N="31" REF="35">
Voice &s;eem'd to have a &s;udden Effect upon him as he recover'd, and he &s;howed a double Cu|rio&s;ity in ob&s;erving her as &s;he &s;poke and call'd to him; till at la&s;t he broke out, What has been done to me? Whither am I carried? Is all this about me, the Thing I have heard &s;o often of? Is this the Light? Is this Seeing? Were you always thus happy, when you &s;aid, you were glad to &s;ee each other? Where is <HI>Tom.</HI> who u&s;ed to lead me? But I could now, methinks, go any where without him. He offered to move, but &s;eem'd afraid of every Thing around him. When they &s;aw his Difficulty, they told him, till he became better acquainted with his new Being, he mu&s;t let the Servant &s;till lead him. The Boy was call'd for, and pre&s;ented to him. Mr. <HI>Ca&s;well</HI> ask'd him, What Sort of Thing he took <HI>Tom.</HI> to be before he had &s;een him. He an&s;wer'd, He believed there was not &s;o much of him as of him&s;elf; but he fancied him the &s;ame Sort of Creature. The Noi&s;e of this &s;udden Change made all the Neighbour|hood throng to the Place where he was. As he &s;aw the Crowd thickening, he de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Ca&s;|well</HI> to tell him how many there were in all to be &s;een. The Gentleman, &s;miling, an&s;wered him, That it would be very proper for him to return to his late Condition, and &s;uffer his Eyes to be covered, till they had received Strength; for he might remember well enough, that by Degrees he had from little and little come to the Strength he had at pre&s;ent in his Ability of Walking and Moving; and that it was the &s;ame Thing with his Eyes, which, he &s;aid, would lo&s;e the Power of continuing to him that won|derful Tran&s;port he was now in, except he would be contented to lay a&s;ide the U&s;e of them, till they were &s;trong enough to bear the Light without &s;o much Feeling, as he knew he
<PB N="32" REF="36">
underwent at pre&s;ent. With much Reluctance he was prevailed upon to have his Eyes bound, in which Condition they kept him in a dark Room, till it was proper to let the Organ receive its Ob|jects without further Precaution. During the Time of this Darkne&s;s, he bewail'd him&s;elf in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Manner, and accu&s;ed all his Friends, complaining, that &s;ome Incantation had been wrought upon him, and &s;ome &s;trange Ma|gick u&s;ed to deceive him into an Opinion, that he had enjoyed what they called Sight. He added, That the Impre&s;&s;ions then let in upon his Soul would certainly di&s;tract him, it he were not &s;o at that pre&s;ent. At another Time he would &s;trive to name the Per&s;ons he had &s;een among the Crowd after he was couched, and would pretend to &s;peak (in perplexed Terms of his own ma|king) of what he in that &s;hort Time ob&s;erved. But on the 6th In&s;tant it was thought fit to un|bind his Head, and the young Woman whom he loved was in&s;tructed to open his Eyes according|ly, as well to indear her &s;elf to him by &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, as to moderate his Exta&s;ies by the Per&s;wa&s;ion of a Voice, which had &s;o much Power over him as hers: ever had. When this belov'd young Woman began to take off the Binding of his Eyes, &s;he talk'd to him as follows: <Q>Mr. <HI>William,</HI> I am now taking the Binding off, though when I con&s;ider what I am doing, I tremble with the Apprehen&s;ion, that (though I have from my very Childhood loved you, dark as you were, and though you had con|ceived &s;o &s;trong a Love for me, yet) you will find there is &s;uch a Thing as Beauty, which may en&s;nare you into a Thou&s;and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;ions of which you now are innocent, and take you from me for ever. But before I put my &s;elf to that Hazard, tell me in what Manner that
<PB N="33" REF="37">
Love you always profe&s;&s;ed to me entered into your Heart; for its u&s;ual Admi&s;&s;ion is at the Eyes.</Q></P>
<P>The young Man an&s;wer'd, <Q>Dear <HI>Lidis,</HI> If I am to lo&s;e by Sight the &s;oft Pantings which I have always felt when I heard your Voice; If I am no more to di&s;tingui&s;h the Step of her I love when &s;he approaches me, but to change that &s;weet and frequent Plea&s;ure for &s;uch an Amaze|ment as I knew the little Time I lately &s;aw: Or if I am to have any Thing be&s;ides, which may take from me the Sen&s;e I have of what appeared mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me at that Time (which Apparition it &s;eems was you): Pull out the&s;e Eyes, before they lead me to be ungrate|ful to you, or undo my &s;elf. I wi&s;h'd for them but to &s;ee you; pull them out, if they are to make me forget you.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lidia</HI> was extremely &s;atisfied with the&s;e A&s;&s;u|rances; and plea&s;ed her &s;elf with playing with his Perplexities. In all his Talk to her, he &s;how|ed but very feint Idea's of any Thing which had not been received at the Ear; and clo&s;ed his Pro|te&s;tation to her, by &s;aying, That if he were to &s;ee <HI>Valentia</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> whom he &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t e&s;teemed of all Women, by the Quarrel there was about them, he would never like any but <HI>Lidia.</HI></P>

<P>THere is a young Foreigner committed to my Care, who puzzles me extremely in the Que&s;tions he asks about the Per&s;ons of Fi|gure we meet in Publick Places.

But <HI>Sophronius,</HI> who never falls into Heat upon any Subject, but applies proper Lan|guage, Temper, and Skill, with which the Thing in Debate is to be treated, told the Youth, that Gentleman had &s;poken nothing but what was literally true, but fell upon it with too much Earne&s;tne&s;s to give a true Idea of that Sort of People he was declaiming again&s;t, or to reme|dy the Evil which he bewail'd: For the Ac|ceptance of the&s;e Men being an Ill which hath crept into the Conver&s;ation-Part of our Lives, and not into our Con&s;titution it &s;elf, it mu&s;t be corrected where it began, and con&s;equently is to be amended only by bringing Raillery and Deri&s;ion upon the Per&s;ons who are guilty, or tho&s;e who conver&s;e with them. For the <HI>Sharpers</HI> (continued he) at pre&s;ent are not as formerly, under the Acceptation of Pickpock|ets; but are by Cu&s;tom erected into a real and venerable Body of Men, and have &s;ubdued us to &s;o very particular a Deference to them, that though they are known to be Men without Honour or Con&s;cience, no Demand is called a Debt of Honour &s;o indi&s;putably as theirs. You may lo&s;e your Honour to them, but they lay none again&s;t you: As the Prie&s;thood in Roman Catholick Countries can purcha&s;e what they plea&s;e for the Church, but they can alienate no|thing from it. It is from this Toleration, that
<PB N="38" REF="42">
<HI>Sharpers</HI> are to be found among all Sorts of A&s;|&s;emblies and Companies, and every Talent a|mong&s;t Men is made U&s;e of by &s;ome one or other of the Society for the Good of their Com|mon Cau&s;e: So that an unexperienced young Gentleman is as often en&s;nared by his Under|&s;tanding as his Folly: For who could be un|moved, to hear the eloquent <HI>Dromio</HI> explain the Con&s;titution, talk in the Key of <HI>Cato,</HI> with the Severity of one of the ancient Sages, and debate the greate&s;t Que&s;tion of State in a common Chocolate or Coffee-hou&s;e; Who could, I &s;ay, hear this generous Declamator, without being fired at his noble Zeal, and becoming his pro|fe&s;&s;ed Follower, if he might be admitted. <HI>Mo|noculus</HI>'s Gravity would be no le&s;s inviting to a Beginner in Conver&s;ation, and the Snare of his Eloquence would equally catch one who had never &s;een an old Gentleman &s;o very wi&s;e, and yet &s;o little &s;evere. Many other In&s;tances of ex|traordinary Men among the Brotherhood might be produced; but every Man who knows the Town, can &s;upply him&s;elf with &s;uch Exam|ples without their being named. <HI>Will. Vafer,</HI> who is skilful at finding out the ridiculous Side of a Thing, and placing it in a new and proper Light, (though he very &s;eldom talks) thought fit to enter into this Subject. He has lately lo&s;t certain loo&s;e Sums, which half the Income of his E&s;tate will bring in within &s;even Years: Be&s;ides which, he propo&s;es to marry to &s;et all right. He was therefore indolent enough to &s;peak of this Matter with great Impartiality. <Q REND="inline">'When I look round me, &s;aid this ea&s;y Gentle|man, and con&s;ider in a ju&s;t Ballance us Bub|bles, Elder Brothers, who&s;e Support our dull Fathers contrived to depend upon certain Acres; with the Rooks, who&s;e Ance&s;tors left them the wide World; I cannot but admire

This ill Fortune makes mo&s;t Men contemplative and given to Read|ing; at lea&s;t it has happened &s;o to me; and the Ri&s;e and Fall of the Family of Sharpers in all Ages has been my Contemplation.'</Q></P>
<P>I find, all Times have had of this People; <HI>Homer,</HI> in his excellent Heroick Poem, calls them <HI>Myrmidons,</HI> who were a Body who kept among them&s;elves, and had nothing to lo&s;e; therefore never &s;pared either <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Trojan,</HI> when they fell in their Way, upon a Party. But there is a memorable Ver&s;e which gives us an Account of what broke that whole Body, and made both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans</HI> Ma&s;ters of the Secret of their Warfare and Plunder. There is nothing &s;o pedantick as many Quotations; therefore I &s;hall inform you only, that in this Battalion there were two Officers called <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> and <HI>Pandarus;</HI> they were both le&s;s renowned for their Beauty than their Wit; but each had this particular Happine&s;s, that they were plunged over Head and Ears in the &s;ame Water, which made <HI>Achilles</HI> invulnerable; and had ever af|ter certain Gifts which the re&s;t of tke World were never to enjoy. Among others, they were
<PB N="40" REF="44">
never to know they were the mo&s;t dreadful to the Sight of all Mortals, never to be diffident of their own Abilities, never to blu&s;h, or ever to be wounded but by each other. Though &s;ome Hi&s;torians &s;ay, Gaming began among the <HI>Ly|dians</HI> to divert Hunger, I could cite many Au|thorities to prove it had its Ri&s;e at the Siege of <HI>Troy;</HI> and that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> won the Sevenfold Shield at Hazard. But be that as it may, the Ruin of the Corps of the <HI>Myrmidons</HI> proceeded from a Breach between <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> and <HI>Pandarus.</HI> The Fir&s;t of the&s;e was Leader of a Squadron, wherein the Latter was but a private Man; but having all the good Qualities nece&s;&s;ary for a Partizan, he was the Favourite of his Officer. But the whole Hi&s;tory of the &s;everal Changes in the Order of Sharpers, from tho&s;e <HI>Myrmidons</HI> to our Modern Men of Addre&s;s and Plunder, will require that we con&s;ult &s;ome ancient Ma|nu&s;cripts. As we make the&s;e Enquiries, we &s;hall diurnally communicate them to the Pub|lick, that the Knights of the Indu&s;try may be better under&s;tood by the good People of <HI>England.</HI> The&s;e Sort of Men in &s;ome Ages, were Syco|phants and Flatterers only, and were endued with Arts of Life to capacitate them for the Conver&s;ation of the Rich and Great; but now the Bubble courts the Impo&s;tor, and pretends at the utmo&s;t to be but his Equal. To clear up the Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es in &s;uch Revolutions, and the different Conduct between Fools and Cheats, &s;hall be one of our Labours for the Good of this Kingdom. How therefore Pimps, Foot|men, Fiddlers, and Lacqueys, are elevated into Companions in this pre&s;ent Age, &s;hall be ac|counted for from the Influence of the Planet <HI>Mercury</HI> on this I&s;land; the A&s;cendency of which Sharper over <HI>Sol,</HI> who is a Patron of the Mu&s;es, and all hone&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions, has been noted by

the learned <HI>Job Gadbury</HI> to be the Cau&s;e, that <HI>Cunning and Trick are more e&s;teemed than Art and Science.</HI> It mu&s;t be allowed al&s;o, to the Memory of Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> late of <HI>Cecil-&s;treet</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> that in his An&s;wer to an Horary Que&s;tion, at what Hour of the Night to &s;et a Fox-Trap in <HI>June</HI> 1705?

<P>I Was this Evening repre&s;enting a Complaint &s;ent me out of the Country from <HI>Emilia.</HI> She &s;ays, her Neighbours there have &s;o little Sen&s;e of what a Refined Lady of the Town is, that &s;he who was a celebrated Wit in <HI>London,</HI> is in that dull Part of the World in &s;o little E&s;teem, that they call her in their ba&s;e Style a <HI>Tongue-Pad.</HI> Old <HI>Truepenny</HI> bid me advi&s;e her to keep her Wit till &s;he comes to Town again, and admo|ni&s;h her, that both Wit and Breeding are local; for a Fine Court-Lady is as aukward among Country Hou&s;ewives, as one of them would appear in a Drawing-Room. 'Tis therefore the mo&s;t u&s;eful Knowledge one can attain at, to under&s;tand among what Sort of Men we make the be&s;t Figure; for if there be a Place where the beauteous and accompli&s;h'd <HI>Emilia</HI> is unac|ceptable, it is certainly a vain Endeavour to at|tempt plea&s;ing in all Conver&s;ations. Here is <HI>Will. Ubi,</HI> who is &s;o thir&s;ty after the Reputation of a Companion, that his Company is for any Body that will accept of it; and for Want of knowing whom to chu&s;e for him&s;elf, is never cho&s;en by others. There is a certain Cha&s;tity of Behaviour which makes a Man de&s;irable, and which, if he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es, his Wit will have the &s;ame Fate with <HI>Delia</HI>'s Beauty, which no one

regards, becau&s;e all know it is within their Power. The be&s;t Cour&s;e <HI>Emilia</HI> can take, is, to have le&s;s Humility; for if &s;he could have as good an Opi|nion of her &s;elf for having every Quality, as &s;ome of her Neighbours have of them&s;elves with one, &s;he would in&s;pire even them with a Sen&s;e of her Merit, and make that Carriage (which is now the Subject of their Deri&s;ion) the &s;ole Object of their Imitation. Till &s;he has arrived at this Va|lue of her &s;elf, &s;he mu&s;t be contented with the Fate of that uncommon Creature, a Woman too humble.</P>

<P>Since my la&s;t, I have received a Letter from <HI>Tom. Trump,</HI> to de&s;ire that I would do the Fra|ternity of Game&s;ters the Ju&s;tice to own, that there are notorious Sharpers who are not of their Cla&s;s. Among others, he pre&s;ented me with the Picture of <HI>Harry Copper&s;mith</HI> in Little, who (he &s;ays) is at this Day worth half a Plumb, by Means much more indirect than by fal&s;e Dice. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there appeared &s;ome Rea&s;on in what he a&s;&s;erted; and he met me &s;ince, and ac|co&s;ted me in the following Manner: <Q REND="inline">"It is won|derful to me, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> that you can pre|tend to be a Man of Penetration, and fall upon us Knights of the Indu&s;try as the wickede&s;t of Mortals, when there are &s;o many who live in the con&s;tant Practice of ba&s;er Methods unob|&s;erved. You cannot (though you know the Story of my &s;elf and the <HI>North Briton</HI>) but al|low I am an hone&s;ter Man than <HI>Will. Copper|&s;mith,</HI> for all his great Credit among the <HI>Lom|bards.</HI> I get my Money by Men's Follies, and he gets his by their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The declining Merchant communicates his Griefs to him, and he augments them by Extortion. If therefore Regard is to be had to the Merit of the Per&s;ons
<PB N="45" REF="49">
we injure, Who is the more blameable, he that oppre&s;&s;es an unhappy Man, or he that cheats a fooli&s;h one? All Mankind are indifferently lia|ble to adver&s;e Strokes of Fortune; and he who adds to them, when he might relieve them, is certainly a wor&s;e Subject, than he who unbur|dens a Man who&s;e Pro&s;perity is unweildy to him. Be&s;ides all which, he that borrows of <HI>Cop|per&s;mith,</HI> does it out of Nece&s;&s;ity; he that plays with me, does it out of Choice.'</Q></P>
<P>I allowed <HI>Trump</HI> there are Men as bad as him|&s;elf, which is the Height of his Preten&s;ions; and mu&s;t confe&s;s, that <HI>Copper&s;mith</HI> is the mo&s;t wicked and impudent of all Sharpers: A Creature that cheats with Credit, and is a Robber in the Habit of a Friend. The Contemplation of this worthy Per&s;on made me reflect on the wonderful Succe&s;|&s;es I have ob&s;erved Men of the meane&s;t Capaci|ties meet with in the World, and recollected an Ob&s;ervation I once heard a &s;age Man make; which was, That he had ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ions, the lower the Under&s;tanding, the greater the Capacity. I remember, he in&s;tanced that of a Banker, and &s;aid, That the fewer Appe|tites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Idea's a Man had, he was the better for his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is little Sir <HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> without Connexion in his Speech, or &s;o much as common Sen&s;e, has arrived by his own natural Parts at one of the greate&s;t E&s;tates among&s;t us. But hone&s;t Sir <HI>Tri|&s;tram</HI> knows him&s;elf to be but a Repo&s;itory for Ca&s;h: He is ju&s;t &s;uch an Uten&s;il as his Iron Che&s;t, and may rather be &s;aid to hold Money, than po&s;&s;e&s;s it. There is nothing &s;o plea&s;ant as to be in the Conver&s;ation of the&s;e wealthy Pro|ficients. I had lately the Honour to drink Half a Pint with Sir <HI>Tri&s;tram, Harry Copper|&s;mith,</HI> and <HI>Giles Two&s;hoes.</HI> The&s;e Wags give one another Credit in Di&s;cour&s;e according to
<PB N="46" REF="50">
their Pur&s;es; they je&s;t by the Pound, and make An&s;wers as they honour Bills. Without Vanity, I thought my &s;elf the Prettie&s;t Fellow of the Company; but I had no Manner of Power over one Mu&s;cle in their Faces, though they &s;neer'd at every Word &s;poken by each other. Sir <HI>Tri|&s;tram</HI> called for a Pipe of Tobacco; and telling us Tobacco was a <HI>Pot-Herb,</HI> bid the Drawer bring in t'other Half-Pint. <HI>Two&s;hoes</HI> laughed at the Knight's Wit without Moderation. I took the Liberty to &s;ay, it was but a Pun. A Pun! &s;ays <HI>Copper&s;mith:</HI> You would be a better Man by 10000 <HI>l.</HI> if you could pun like Sir <HI>Tri&s;tram.</HI> With that, they all bur&s;t out together. The Queer Curs maintain'd this Style of Dialogue till we had drank our Quarts a-piece by Half-Pints. All I could bring away with me, is, That <HI>Two&s;hoes</HI> is not worth Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds; for his Mirth, though he was as in&s;ipid as either of the others, had no more Effect up|on the Company, than if he had been a Bank|rupt.</P>

<P>I have heard, it has been advi&s;ed by a Dioce&s;an to his inferior Clergy, that in&s;tead of broaching Opinions of their own, and uttering Doctrines which may lead them&s;elves and Hearers into Errors, they would read &s;ome of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated Sermons printed by others for the In|&s;truction of their Congregations. In Imitation of &s;uch Preachers at Second-hand, I &s;hall tran|&s;cribe from <HI>Bruyere</HI> one of the mo&s;t elegant Pie|ces of Raillery and Satyr which I have ever read. He de&s;cribes the <HI>French,</HI> as if &s;peaking of a Peo|ple not yet di&s;cover'd, in the Air and Style of a Traveller.</P>
<Q><PB N="47" REF="51">I have heard talk of a Country where the old Men are Gallant, Polite and Civil: The young Men, on the contrary, Stubborn, Wild, without either Manners or Civility. They are free from Pa&s;&s;ion for Women, at the Age when in other Countries they begin to feel it; and prefer Bea&s;ts, Victuals, and ridiculous Amours, before them. Among&s;t the&s;e People, he is &s;ober who is never drunk with any Thing but Wine; the too frequent U&s;e of it has rendered it flat and in&s;ipid to them: They endeavour by Brandy, and other &s;trong Liquors, to quicken their Ta&s;te, already extingui&s;h'd, and want nothing to compleat their Debauchees, but to drink <HI>Aqua Fortis.</HI> The Women of that Country ha&s;ten the Decay of their Beauty, by their Artifices to pre&s;erve it: They paint their Cheeks, Eyebrows, and Shoul|ders, which they lay open, together with their Brea&s;ts, Arms and Ears, as if they were afraid to hide tho&s;e Places which they think will plea&s;e, and never think they &s;how enough of them. The Phy&s;iognomies of the People of that Country are not all neat, but confu&s;ed and embarra&s;|&s;ed with a Bundle of &s;trange Hair, which they prefer before their natural: With this they weave &s;omething to cover their Heads, which de&s;cends down half Way their Bodies, hides their Features, and hinders you from knowing Men by their Faces. This Nation has be&s;ides this, their God and their King. The Grandees go every Day at a certain Hour to a Temple they call a Church: At the upper End of that Temple there &s;tands an Altar con&s;ecrated to their God, where the Prie&s;t celebrates &s;ome My&s;teries which they call holy, &s;acred and tremendous. The great Men make a va&s;t Circle at the Foot of the Al|tar, &s;tanding with their Backs to the Prie&s;t and the Holy My&s;teries, and their Faces erected to|wards their King, who is &s;een on his Knees upon

a Throne, and to whom they &s;eem to direct the De&s;ires of their Hearts, and all their Devotion. However, in this Cu&s;tom there is to be remark|ed a Sort of Subordination; for the People appear adoring their Prince, and their Prince adoring God.

<P><HI>Indibilis</HI>'s Heart was too full to make him any An&s;wer, but he threw him&s;elf at the Feet of the General, and wept aloud.

Does not that obliged Virgin give you, while &s;he prays to the Gods for your Pro&s;perity, and thinks you &s;ent down from them, Raptures, above all the Tran&s;ports which you could have reaped from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her injur'd Per&s;on?</HI> The temperate <HI>Sci|pio</HI> an&s;wered him without much Emotion, and, &s;aying, <HI>Father, be a Friend to</HI> Rome, retired.

He being well known to us all, asked what we were upon? For he had a Mind to con&s;ummate the Happine&s;s of the Day, which had been &s;pent among the Stars of the fir&s;t Mag|nitude, among the Men of Letters; and there|fore, to put a Period to it, as he had commenced it, he &s;hould be glad to be allowed to participate of the Plea&s;ure of our Society. I told him the Subject. Faith, Gentlemen, &s;aid <HI>Martius,</HI> your Subject is humble; and if you would give me Leave to elevate the Conver&s;ation, I &s;hould hum|bly offer, that you would enlarge your Enquiries to the Word <HI>For as-much:</HI> For though I take it, &s;aid he, to be but one Word; yet, the Particle <HI>Much</HI> implying Quantity, the Particle <HI>As</HI> Simili|tude, it will be greater, and more like our &s;elves, to treat of <HI>For-as-much: Jack Comma</HI> is always &s;erious, and an&s;wer'd; <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Martius,</HI> I mu&s;t take the Liberty to &s;ay, That you have fallen into all this Error and profu&s;e Manner of Speech by a certain Hurry in your Imagination, for Want of being more exact in the Knowledge of the Parts of

Speech; and it is &s;o with all Men who have not well &s;tudied the Particle <HI>For.</HI> You have &s;poken <HI>For</HI> without making any Inference, which is the great U&s;e of that Particle. There is no Manner of Force in your Ob&s;ervation of Quantity and Si|militude in the Syllables <HI>As</HI> and <HI>Much.</HI> But it is ever the Fault of Men of great Wit to be in|correct; which Evil they run into by an indi&s;|creet U&s;e of the Word <HI>For.</HI> Con&s;ider all the Books of Controver&s;y which have been written, and I'll ingage you will ob&s;erve, that all the De|bate lies in this Point, Whether they brought in <HI>For</HI> in a ju&s;t Manner, or forced it in for their own U&s;e, rather than as under&s;tanding the U&s;e of the Word it &s;elf? There is nothing like familiar In|&s;tances: You have heard the Story of the <HI>Iri&s;h|man,</HI> who reading, <HI>Money for Live Hair,</HI> took a Lodging, and expected to be paid for living at that Hou&s;e.

<P><HI>Martius</HI> &s;eem'd at a Lo&s;s, and admiring his pro|found Learning, wi&s;hed he had been bred a Scho|lar, for he did not take the Scope of his Di&s;cour&s;e. This wi&s;e Debate, of which we had much more, made me reflect upon the Difference of their Ca|pacities, and wonder that there could be as it were a Diver&s;ity in Men's Genius for Non&s;ence; that one &s;hould blu&s;ter, while another crept in Ab&s;ur|dities. <HI>Martius</HI> moves like a blind Man, lifting his Legs higher than the ordinary Way of Step|ping; and <HI>Comma,</HI> like one who is only &s;hort|&s;ighted, picking his Way when he &s;hould be marching on. Want of Learning makes <HI>Martius</HI> a brisk entertaining Fool, and gives him&s;elf a full Scope; but that which <HI>Comma</HI> has, and calls Learning, makes him diffident, and curb his na|tural Mi&s;under&s;tanding, to the great Lo&s;s of the
<PB N="54" REF="58">
Men of Raillery. This Conver&s;ation confirm'd me in the Opinion, that Learning u&s;ually does but improve in us what Nature endowed us with. He that wants good Sen&s;e, is unhappy in having it, for he has thereby only more Ways of expo|&s;ing him&s;elf; and he that has Sen&s;e, knows that Learning is not Knowledge, but rather the Art of u&s;ing it.</P>

<P><HI>AESOP</HI> has gain'd to him&s;elf an immortal Re|nown for figuring the Manners, De&s;ires, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Intere&s;ts of Men, by Fables of Bea&s;ts and Birds: I &s;hall in my future Accounts of our modern Heroes and Wits vulgarly called <HI>Sharpers,</HI> imitate the Method of that delightful Morali&s;t; and think, I cannot repre&s;ent tho&s;e Worthies more naturally than under the Sha|dow of a Pack of Dogs; for this Set of Men are like them, made up of Finders, Lurchers, and Setters.

<P>But I am diverted from the Train of my Di&s;cour&s;e of the Fraternity about this Town by Letters from <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> which give me an Account, there is a late In&s;titution there, under the Name of a <HI>Raf|fling-Shop,</HI> which is, it &s;eems, &s;ecretly &s;upported by a Per&s;on who is a deep Practitioner in the Law, and, out of Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience, has, under the Name of his Maid <HI>Si&s;ly,</HI> &s;et up this ea&s;ier Way of Conveyancing and Alienating E&s;tates from one Family to another. He is &s;o far from having an Intelligence with the re&s;t of the Fraternity, that all the humbler Cheats who appear there are faced by the Partners in the
<PB N="56" REF="60">
Bank, and driven off by the Reflection of &s;upe|rior Bra&s;s. This Notice is given to all the &s;illy Faces that pa&s;s that Way, that they may not be decoyed in by the &s;oft Allurement of a Fine Lady, who is the Sign to the Pageantry. And at the &s;ame Time Signior <HI>Hawk&s;ly,</HI> who is the Patron of the Hou&s;hold, is de&s;ired to leave off this in|terloping Trade, or admit, as he ought to do, the Knights of the Indu&s;try to their Share in the Spoil.

<P>The pre&s;ent Race of Terriers and Hounds would &s;tarve, were it not for the enchanted <HI>Actaeon,</HI> who has kept the whole Pack for many Succe&s;|&s;ions of Hunting Sea&s;ons. <HI>Actaeon</HI> has long Tracts of rich Soil; but had the Misfortune in his Youth to fall under the Power of Sorcery, and has been ever &s;ince, &s;ome Parts of the Year a Deer, and in &s;ome Parts a Man. While he is a Man, (&s;uch is the Force of Magick) he no &s;ooner grows to &s;uch a Bulk and Fatne&s;s, but he is again turned into a Deer, and hunted till he is lean; upon which he returns to his humane Shape. Many Arts have been tried, and many Re&s;olutions taken by <HI>Actaeon</HI> him&s;elf, to follow &s;uch Methods as would break the Inchantment; but all have hitherto proved ineffectual. I have therefore, by Midnight Watchings and much Care, found out, that there is no Way to &s;ave him from the Jaws of his Hounds, but to de&s;troy the Pack, which, by A&s;trological Prae&s;cience, I find I am de&s;tin'd to perform. For which End I have &s;ent out my Familiar, to bring me a Li&s;t of all the Places where they are harboured, that I may know where to &s;ound my Horn, and bring them toge|ther, and take an Account of their Haunts and their Marks, again&s;t another Opportunity.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving a peculiar Humour of de&s;iring to be &s;omewhat the better or wi&s;er for what I read, I am always unea&s;y when, in any pro|found Writer, (for I read no others) I happen to meet with what I cannot under&s;tand. When this falls out, 'tis a great Grievance to me that I am not able to con&s;ult the Author him&s;elf a|bout his Meaning; for Commentators are a Sect that has little Share in my E&s;teem; your elaborate Writings have, among many others, this Advantage, that their Author is &s;till alive, and ready (as his exten&s;ive Charity makes us expect) to explain whatever may be found in in them too &s;ublime for vulgar Under&s;tandings. This, Sir, makes me pre&s;ume to ask you, How the <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> Hero's Character could be per|fectly new when the la&s;t Letters came away, and yet Sir <HI>John Suckling</HI> &s;o well acquainted with it Sixty Years ago? I hope, Sir, you will not take this ami&s;s: I can a&s;&s;ure you, I have a profound Re&s;p ct for you, which makes me write this, with the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition with which <HI>Longinus</HI> bids us read <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Plato. When in reading</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>any of tho&s;e celebrated Authors, we meet with a Pa&s;&s;age to which we cannot well reconcile our Rea&s;ons, we ought firmly to believe, that were tho&s;e great Wits pre&s;ent to an&s;wer for them&s;elves, we &s;hould to our Wonder be convinced, that we only are guilty of the Mi|&s;takes</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="62">
<HI>we before attributed to them.</HI> If you think fit to remove the Scruple that now torments me, 'twill be an Encouragement to me to &s;et|tle a frequent Corre&s;pondence with you, &s;eve|ral Things falling in my Way which would not, perhaps, be altogether foreign to your Purpo&s;e, and whereon your Thoughts would be very ac|ceptable to</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t humble Servant, <HI>Obadiah Greenhat.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I own this is clean, and Mr. <HI>Greenhat</HI> has con|vinced me that I have writ Non&s;ence; yet am I not at all offended at him,
<Q><L>Scimus, &amp; hanc Veniam petimu&s;&abque; damu&s;&abque; vici&s;&s;im.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is the true Art of Raillery, when a Man turns another into Ridicule, and &s;hows at the &s;ame Time he is in good Humour, and not urg'd on by Malice again&s;t the Per&s;on he rallies. <HI>Obadiah Greenhat</HI> has hit this very well: For to make an Apology to <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff;</HI> an unknown Student and Horary Hi&s;torian, as well as A&s;trologer, and with a grave Face to &s;ay, He &s;peaks of him by the &s;ame Rules with which he would treat <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Plato,</HI> is to place him in Company where he can|not expect to make a Figure; and makes him flatter him&s;elf, that it is only being named with them which renders him mo&s;t ridiculous.</P>
<P>I have not known, and I am now pa&s;t my Grand Climacterick, being 64 Years of Age, ac|cording to my Way of Life, or rather (if you will allow Punning in an old Gentleman) accor|ding to my Way of Pa&s;time; I &s;ay, as old as I am, I have not been acquainted with many of the <HI>Greenhats.</HI> There is indeed one <HI>Zedekiah Green|hat,</HI> who is lucky al&s;o in his Way. He has a very agreeable Manner; for when he has a Mind
<PB N="59" REF="63">
throughly to correct a Man, he never takes from him any Thing, but he allows him &s;omething for it; or el&s;e, he blames him for Things wherein he is not defective, as well as for Matters wherein he is. This makes a weak Man believe he is in Je&s;t in the whole. T'other Day he told Beau <HI>Prim,</HI> who is thought impotent, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s had declared &s;he would not have him, becau&s;e he was a Sloven, and had committed a Rape. The Beau bit at the Banter, and &s;aid very gravely, He thought to be clean was as much as was nece&s;&s;ary, and that as to the Rape, he wondered by what Witchcraft that &s;hould come to her Ears; but it had indeed co&s;t him an Hundred Pounds to hu&s;h the Affair.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greenhats</HI> are a Family with &s;mall Voices and &s;hort Arms, therefore they have Power with none but their Friends: They never call after tho&s;e who run away from them, or pretend to take hold of you if you re&s;i&s;t. But it has been remark|able, that all who have &s;hunned their Com|pany, or not li&s;tened to them, have fallen into the Hands of &s;uch as have knock'd out their own Brains, or broken their Bones. I have looked over our Pedigree upon the Receipt of this Epi|&s;tle, and find the <HI>Greenhats</HI> are a-kin to the <HI>Staffs.</HI> They de&s;cend from <HI>Maudlin,</HI> the Left-handed Wife of <HI>Nehemiah Bicker&s;taff,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Harry</HI> II. And it is remarkable, that they are all Left-handed, and have always been very expert at Single Rapier. A Man mu&s;t be very much u&s;ed to their Play to know how to defend him&s;elf; for their Po&s;ture is &s;o different from that of the Right handed, that you run upon their Swords if you pu&s;h forward; and they are in with you, if you offer to fall back without keep|ing your Guard.</P>
<P>There have been al&s;o Letters lately &s;ent to me which relate to other People: Among the re&s;t, &s;ome whom I have heretofore declared to be &s;o, are decea&s;ed. I mu&s;t not therefore break thro'

<P>We hear from <HI>Tournay,</HI> That on the Night be|tween the 22d and 23d, they went on with their Works in the Enemy's Mines, and levelled the Earth which was taken out of them. The next Day, at 8 in the Morning, when the <HI>French</HI> ob&s;erved we were relieving our Trenches, they &s;prung a larger Mine than any they had fired during this Siege, which killed only four private Centinels. The en|&s;uing Night, we had three Men and two Officers killed, as al&s;o &s;even Men wounded. Between the 24th and 25th, we repair'd &s;ome Works which the Enemy had ruin'd. On the next Day, &s;ome of the Enemy's Magazines blew up; and it is thought they were de&s;troy'd on Purpo&s;e by &s;ome of their Men, who are impatient of the Hard&s;hips of the pre&s;ent Service.

The Two former Vices he had from his Father; but was led into the la&s;t by the Conver&s;ation of a Partizan of the <HI>Mirmidons,</HI> who had Chambers near him. His Allowance from his Father was a very plentiful one for a Man of Sen&s;e, but as &s;canty for a modern Fine Gentleman. His fre|quent Lo&s;&s;es had reduced him to &s;o nece&s;&s;itous a Condition, that his Lodgings were always haunt|ed by impatient Creditors, and all his Thoughts employed in contriving low Methods to &s;upport him&s;elf, in a Way of Life from which he knew not how to retreat, and in which he wanted

Means to proceed. There is never wanting &s;ome good-natured Per&s;on to &s;end a Man an Account of what he has no Mind to hear; therefore many Epi&s;tles were conveyed to the Father of this Ex|travagant, to inform him of the Company, the Plea&s;ures, the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and Entertainments, in which his Son pa&s;&s;ed his Time.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received an Order under your Hand for a Thou&s;and Pounds, in Words at Length, and I think I could &s;wear it is your Hand. I have looked

</LETTER>
<P>The old Gentleman took no Manner of Notice of the Receipt of his Letter; but &s;ent him ano|ther Order for Three Thou&s;and Pounds more. His Amazement on this &s;econd Letter was un|&s;peakable. He immediately double-lock'd his Door, and &s;ate down carefully to reading and comparing both his Orders. After he had read 'em till he was half mad, he walked Six or Seven Turns in his Chamber, then opens his Door, then locks it again; and to examine throughly this Matter, he locks his Door again, puts his Table and Chairs again&s;t it; then goes into his Clo&s;et, and locking him&s;elf in, read his Notes over again about Nineteen Times, which did but increa&s;e his A&s;toni&s;hment. Soon after, he began to recollect many Stories he had for|merly heard of Per&s;ons who had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Imaginations and Appearances which had no Foundation in Nature, but had been taken with &s;udden Madne&s;s in the Mid&s;t of a &s;eeming clear and untainted Rea&s;on. This made him very gravely conclude he was out of his Wits; and with a De&s;ign to compo&s;e him&s;elf, he immediate|ly betakes him to his Night-cap, with a Re&s;o|lution to &s;leep him&s;elf into his former Poverty and Sen&s;es. To Bed therefore he goes at Noon-Day, but &s;oon ro&s;e again, and re&s;olved to vi&s;it Sir <HI>Tri&s;tam</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion. He did &s;o, and dined with the Knight, expecting he would men|tion &s;ome Advice from his Father about paying him Money; but no &s;uch Thing being &s;aid, Look you, Sir <HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> (&s;aid he) you are to know, that an Affair has happened, which&mdash;Look you, (&s;ays <HI>Tri&s;tram</HI>) I know Mr. <HI>Wildair,</HI>

When he had looked at it for a convenient Time, and as often &s;urveyed <HI>Tom</HI>'s Looks and Countenance; Look you, Mr. <HI>Wildair,</HI> a Thou&s;and Pounds&mdash;Before he could pro|ceed, he &s;hows him the Order for Three Thou|&s;and more&mdash;Sir <HI>Tri&s;tram</HI> examined the Or|ders at the Light, and finding at the writing the Name, there was a certain Stroke in one Letter, which the Father and he had agreed &s;hould be to &s;uch Directions as he de&s;ired might be more immediately honoured, he forthwith pays the Money. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Four Thou&s;and Pounds gave my young Gentleman a new Train of Thoughts: He began to reflect upon his Birth, the great Expectations he was born to, and the un&s;uitable Ways he had long pur&s;ued. In&s;tead of that unthinking Creature he was before, he is now provident, generous, and di&s;creet. The Father and Son have an exact and regular Cor|re&s;pondence, with mutual and unre&s;erved Confi|dence in each other. The Son looks upon his Father as the be&s;t Tenant he could have in the Country, and the Father finds the Son the mo&s;t &s;afe Banker he could have in the City.</P>

<P>There is not any Thing in Nature &s;o extrava|gant, but that you will find one Man or other that &s;hall practi&s;e or maintain it; otherwi&s;e, <HI>Harry Spondee</HI> could not have made &s;o long an Harangue as he did here this Evening, concerning the Force and Efficacy of well-applied Non&s;ence. Among Ladies, he po&s;itively averr'd, it was the mo&s;t prevailing Part of Eloquence; and had &s;o little Complai&s;ance as to &s;ay, a Woman is never taken by her Rea&s;on, but always by her Pa&s;&s;ion. He proceeded to a&s;&s;ert, the Way to move that,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
was only to a&s;toni&s;h her. I know (continued he) a very late In&s;tance of this; for being by Accident in the next Room to <HI>Strephon,</HI> I could not help over-hearing him as he made Love to a certain great Lady's Woman. The true Method in your Application to one of this &s;econd Rank of Under&s;tanding, is not to elevate and &s;urprize, but rather to elevate and amaze. <HI>Strephon</HI> is a perfect Ma&s;ter in this Kind of Per&s;wa&s;ion: His Way is, to run over with a &s;oft Air a Multitude of Words, without Meaning or Connexion, but &s;uch as do each of 'em apart give a plea&s;ing Idea, though they have nothing to do with each other as he a&s;&s;embles 'em. After the common Phra&s;es of Salutation, and making his Entry into the Room, I perceived he had taken the fair Nymph's Hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it, &s;aid, Witne&s;s to my Happine&s;s ye Groves! Be &s;till ye Rivulets! Oh! Woods, Caves, Fountains, Trees, Dales, Mountains, Hills, and Streams! Oh! Faire&s;t, Could you love me? To which I over-heard her an&s;wer, with a very pretty Li&s;p, Oh! <HI>Strephon,</HI> You are a dangerous Creature: Why do you talk the&s;e tender Things to me? But you Men of Wit&mdash;Is it then po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid the enamour'd <HI>Strephon,</HI> that &s;he regards my Sorrows? Oh! Pi|ty, thou Balmy Cure to an Heart o'erloaded. If Rapture, Solicitation, &s;oft De&s;ire, and plea&s;ing Anxiety&mdash;But &s;till I live in the mo&s;t afflicting of all Circum&s;tances, Doubt&mdash;Cannot my Charmer name the Place and Moment?</P>
<Q><L>There all tho&s;e Joys in&s;atiably to prove,</L>
<L>With which Rich Beauty feeds the Glutton, Love.</L></Q>
<P>Forgive me, Madam, it is not that my Heart is weary of its Chain, but&mdash;This incoherent Stuff was an&s;wer'd by a tender Sigh, Why do you put your Wit to a week Woman? <HI>Strephon</HI> &s;aw he had made &s;ome Progre&s;s in her Heart,
<PB N="66" REF="70">
and pur&s;ued it, by &s;aying that he would certain|ly wait upon her at &s;uch an Hour near <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>'s Pond; and then&mdash;The Sylvian Deities, and Rural Powers of the Place, &s;acred and inviola|ble to <HI>Love; Love,</HI> The Mover of all noble Hearts, &s;hould hear his Vows repeated by the Streams and Ecchoes. The A&s;&s;ignation was ac|cordingly made. This Style he calls the unintel|ligible Method of &s;peaking his Mind; and I'll en|gage, had this Gallant &s;poken plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;he had never under&s;tood him half &s;o readily: For we may take it for granted, That he'll be e&s;teem|ed as a very cold Lover, who di&s;covers to his Mi&s;tre&s;s that he is in his Sen&s;es.</P>

<P>AMong many Phra&s;es which have crept into Conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially of &s;uch Company as frequent this Place, there is not one which mi&s;leads me more, than that of a <HI>Fellow of a great deal of Fire.</HI> This Metaphorical Term, <HI>Fire,</HI> has done much Good in keeping Coxcombs in Awe
<PB N="68" REF="72">
of one another; but at the &s;ame Time it has made 'em trouble&s;ome to every Body el&s;e. You &s;ee in the very Air of a <HI>Fellow of Fire,</HI> &s;omething &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ive of what he would be at, that if it were not for Self-Pre&s;ervation, a Man would laugh out.</P>
<P>I had la&s;t Night the Fate to drink a Bottle with Two of the&s;e <HI>Fire-men,</HI> who are indeed di&s;per&s;ed like the <HI>Mirmidons</HI> in all Quarters, and to be met with among tho&s;e of the mo&s;t diffe|rent Education. One of my Companions was a Scholar with <HI>Fire;</HI> the other a Soldier of the &s;ame Complexion. My learned Man would fall into Di&s;putes, and argue without any Manner of Provocation or Contradiction: The other was deci&s;ive without Words, and would give a Shrug or an Oath to expre&s;s his Opinion. My learned Man was a meer Scholar, and my Man of War as meer a Soldier. The Particularity of the Fir&s;t was ridiculous; that of the Second, terrible. They were Relations by Blood, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure moderated their Extravagancies to|wards each other: I gave my &s;elf up meerly as a Per&s;on of no Note in the Company, but as if brought to be convinced, that I was an incon|&s;iderable Thing, any otherwi&s;e than that they would &s;how each other to me, and make me Spectator of the Triumph they alternately en|joy'd. The Scholar has been very conver&s;ant with Books, and the other with Men only; which makes 'em both &s;uperficial: For the Ta&s;te of Books is nece&s;&s;ary to our Behaviour in the be&s;t Company, and the Knowledge of Men is required for a true Reli&s;h of Books: But they have both <HI>Fire,</HI> which makes one pa&s;s for a Man of Sen&s;e, and the other for a Fine Gentleman. I found I could ea&s;ily enough pa&s;s my Time with the Scholar; for if I &s;eem'd not to do Ju|&s;tice to his Parts and Sentiments, he pitied me, and let me alone. But the Warrior could not let it re&s;t there; I mu&s;t know all that happen'd
<PB N="69" REF="73">
within his &s;hallow Ob&s;ervations of the Nature of the War: To all which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dded, an Air of Lazine&s;s, and Contempt of tho&s;e of his Compa|nions who were eminent for delighting in the Exerci&s;e and Knowledge of their Duty. Thus it is, that all the young Fellows of much animal Life, and little Under&s;tanding, that repair to our Armies, u&s;urp upon the Conver&s;ation of rea&s;on|able Men, under the Notion of having <HI>Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The Word has not been of greater U&s;e to &s;hal|low Lovers, to &s;upply them with Chat to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, than it has been to pretended Men of Plea&s;ure to &s;upport them in being pert and dull, and &s;aying of every Fool of their Order, <HI>Such a one has Fire.</HI> There is Colonel <HI>Truncheon,</HI> who marches with Divi&s;ions ready on all Occa&s;ions; an Hero who never doubted in his Life, but is ever po&s;itively fix'd in the Wrong, not out of ob|&s;tinate Opinion, but invincible Stupidity.</P>
<P>It is very unhappy for this Latitude of <HI>London,</HI> that it is po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch as can learn only Fa|&s;hion, Habit, and a Set of common Phra&s;es of Salutation, to pa&s;s with no other Accompli&s;h|ments, in this Nation of Freedom, for Men of Conver&s;ation and Sen&s;e. All the&s;e ought to pre|tend to, is, not to offend; but they carry it &s;o far, as to be negligent, whether they offend or not; <HI>For they have Fire.</HI> But their Force differs from true Spirit, as much as a vicious from a mettle&s;ome Hor&s;e. A Man of <HI>Fire</HI> is a general Enemy to all the Waiters where you drink, is the only Man affronted at the Company's being neglected, and makes the Drawers abroad, his Valet de Chambre and Footmen at home, know, he is not to be provoked without Danger.</P>
<P>This is not the <HI>Fire</HI> that animates the noble <HI>Mari|nus,</HI> a Youth of good Nature, Affability, and Mo|deration. He commands his Ship, as an Intelli|gence moves its Orb: He is the vital Life, and his Officers the Limbs of the Machine. His Vi|vacity
<PB N="70" REF="74">
is &s;een in doing all the Offices of Life with Readine&s;s of Spirit, and Propriety in the Manner of doing them. To be ever active in laudable Pur&s;uits, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Chara|cter of a Man of Merit; while the Common Be|haviour of every gay Coxcomb of <HI>Fire</HI> is to be confidently in the Wrong, and dare to per&s;i&s;t in it.</P>

<P>It is a common Objection again&s;t Writings of a Satyrical Mixture, that they hurt Men in their Reputations, and con&s;equently in their Fortunes and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; but a Gentleman who frequents this Room declared, he was of Opinion it ought to be &s;o, provided &s;uch Performances had their proper Re&s;trictions. The greate&s;t Evils in hu|mane Society are &s;uch as no Law can come at; as in the Ca&s;e of Ingratitude, where the Man|ner of obliging very often leaves the Benefactor without Means of demanding Ju&s;tice, though that very Circum&s;tance &s;hould be the more bind|ing to the Per&s;on who has received the Benefit. On &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, &s;hall it be po&s;&s;ible for the Malefactor to e&s;cape? And is it not lawful to &s;et Marks upon Per&s;ons who live within the Law, and do ba&s;e Things? Shall not we u&s;e the &s;ame Protection of tho&s;e Laws to puni&s;h them, which they have to defend them&s;elves? We &s;hall there|fore take it for a very moral Action to find a good Appellation for Offenders, and to turn them into Ridicule under feigned Names.</P>
<P>I am adverti&s;ed by a Letter of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 25th, That the Name of <HI>Copper&s;mith</HI> has very much wanted Explanation in the City, and by that Means unju&s;tly given, by tho&s;e who are con&s;cious they de&s;erve it them&s;elves, to an hone&s;t and worthy Citizen belonging to the <HI>Copper-Office;</HI> but that Word is framed out of a moral Con&s;ide|ration of Wealth among&s;t Men, whereby he that has gotten any Part of it by Inju&s;tice and Extor|tion,
<PB N="71" REF="75">
is to be thought in the Eye of virtuous Men &s;o much the poorer for &s;uch Gain. Thus all the Gold which is torn from our Neighbours, by making Advantage of their Wants, is Cop|per; and I authorize the <HI>Lombards</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves accordingly. All the hone&s;t, who make a rea&s;onable Profit, both for the Advantage of them&s;elves and tho&s;e they deal with, are Gold|&s;miths; but tho&s;e who tear unju&s;tly all they can, Copper&s;miths. At the &s;ame Time I de&s;ire him who is mo&s;t guilty, to &s;it down &s;atisfied with Riches and Contempt, and be known by the Ti|tle of, <HI>The Copper&s;mith;</HI> as being the Chief of that re&s;pected, contemptible Fraternity.</P>
<P>This is the Ca&s;e of all others mentioned in our Lucubrations, particularly of <HI>Stentor,</HI> who goes on in his Vociferations at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s with &s;o much Ob&s;tinacy, that he has received Admonition from St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s for it from a Per&s;on of eminent Wit and Piety; but who is by old Age reduced to the Infirmity of &s;leeping at a Service, to which he has been Fifty Years attentive, and who&s;e Death, whenever it happens, may, with that of the Saints, well be called, Falling a&s;leep; for the Innocence of his Life makes him expect it as in|differently as he does his ordinary Re&s;t. This gives him a Chearfulne&s;s of Spirit to rally his own Weakne&s;s, and hath made him write to <HI>Stentor</HI> to hearken to my Admonitions. Brother <HI>Stentor,</HI> (&s;aid he) for the Repo&s;e of the Church, hearken to <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> and con&s;ider, that while you are &s;o devout at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, we cannot &s;leep for you at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s.</P>

<P>There has been lately &s;ent me a much harder Que&s;tion than was ever yet put to me &s;ince I pro|fe&s;&s;ed A&s;trology; to wit, How far, and to what Age, Women ought to make their Beauty their chief Concern? The Regard and Care of their Faces and Per&s;ons are as variou&s;ly to be con&s;i|der'd,
<PB N="72" REF="76">
as their Complexions them&s;elves differ; but if one may tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the careful Practice of the Fair Sex &s;o much as to give an Opinion again&s;t it, I humbly pre&s;ume, that le&s;s Care, better apply'd, would increa&s;e their Empire, and make it la&s;t as long as Life. Whereas now, from their own Example, we take our E&s;teem of their Merit from it; for it is very ju&s;t, that &s;he who values her &s;elf only on her Beauty, &s;hould be re|garded by others on no other Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>There is certainly a liberal and pedantick Edu|cation among Women as well as Men, and the Merit la&s;ts accordingly. She therefore that is bred with Freedom, and in good Company, con|&s;iders Men according to their re&s;pective Chara|cters and Di&s;tinctions; while &s;he that is lock'd up from &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, will con&s;ider her Father's Butler not as a Butler, but as a Man. In like Manner, when Men conver&s;e with Women, the Well-bred and Intelligent are looked upon with an Ob&s;ervation &s;uitable to their different Talents and Accompli&s;hments, without Re&s;pect to their Sex; while a meer Woman can be ob&s;erved under no Con&s;ideration but that of a Woman; and there can be but one Rea&s;on for placing any Value up|on her, or lo&s;ing Time in her Company. Where|fore I am of Opinion, that the Rule for plea&s;ing long, is, to obtain &s;uch Qualifications as would make them &s;o were they not Women.</P>
<P>Let the beauteous <HI>Cleomira</HI> then &s;hew us her real Face, and know, that every Stage of Life has its peculiar Charms, and that there is no Nece&s;&s;ity for Fifty to be Fifteen: That Childi&s;h colouring of her Cheeks is now as ungraceful, as that Shape would have been when her Face wore its real Countenance. She has Sen&s;e, and ought to know, that if &s;he will not follow Nature, Nature will follow her. Time then has made that Per&s;on, which had (when I vi&s;ited her Grandfather) an agreeable
<PB N="73" REF="77">
Bloom, &s;prightly Air, and &s;oft Utterance, now no le&s;s graceful in a lovely A&s;pect, an awful Man|ner, and material Wi&s;dom. But her Heart was &s;o &s;et upon her fir&s;t Character, that &s;he neglects and repines at her pre&s;ent; not that &s;he is again&s;t a more &s;tay'd Conduct in others, for &s;he recom|mends Gravity, Circum&s;pection, and Severity of Countenance, to her Daughter. Thus, again&s;t all Chronology, the Girl is the Sage, the Mother the Fine Lady.</P>
<P>But the&s;e great Evils proceed from an unac|countable wild Method in the Education of the better half of the World, the Women. We have no &s;uch Thing as a Standard for good Breeding. I was the other Day at my Lady <HI>Wealthy</HI>'s, and asked one of her Daughters, How &s;he did? She an&s;wer'd, She never convers'd with Men. The &s;ame Day I vi&s;ited at Lady <HI>Plantwell</HI>'s, and ask'd her Daughter the &s;ame Que&s;tion. She an&s;wers, What's that to you, you old Thief? And gives me a Slap on the Shoulders.</P>
<P>I defy any Man in <HI>England,</HI> except he knows the Family before he enters, to be able to iudge whether he &s;hall be agreeable or not, when he comes into it. You find either &s;ome odd old Woman, who is permitted to rule as long as &s;he lives, in Hopes of her Death, and to interrupt all Things; or &s;ome impertinent young Woman, who will talk &s;illily upon the Strength of looking beautifully. I will not an&s;wer for it, but it may be, that I (like all other old Fellows) have a Fondne&s;s for the Fa|&s;hions and Manners which prevailed when I was young and in Fa&s;hion my &s;elf: But cer|tain it is, that the Ta&s;te of Grace and Beauty is very much lower'd! The Fine Women they &s;how me now-a-days, are at be&s;t but pretty Girls to me who have &s;een <HI>Sachari&s;&s;a,</HI> when all the World repeated the Poems &s;he in&s;pir'd,
<PB N="74" REF="78">
and <HI>Villaria,</HI> when a youthful King was her Subject. The Things you follow and make Songs on now, &s;hould be &s;ent to knit, or &s;it down to Bobbins or Bone-Lace: They are in|deed neat, and &s;o are their Semp&s;tre&s;&s;es; they are pretty, and &s;o are their Handmaids. But that graceful Motion; that awful Mien, and that winning Attraction, which grew upon 'em from the Thoughts and Conver&s;ations they met with in my Time, are now no more &s;een. They tell me I am old: I am glad I am &s;o; for I don't like your pre&s;ent young Ladies.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e among us who &s;et up for any Thing of Decorum, do &s;o mi&s;take the Matter, that they of|fend on the other Side. Five young Ladies who are of no &s;mall Fame for their great Severity of Manners, and exemplary Behaviour, would lately go no where with their Lovers but to an Organ-Loft in a Church, where they had a Cold Treat, and &s;ome few Opera Songs, to their great Refre&s;hment and Edification. Whether the&s;e prudent Per&s;ons had not been as much &s;o, if this had been done at a Tavern, is not very hard to determine. 'Tis &s;uch &s;illy Starts and Inco|herences as the&s;e which undervalue the beau|teous Sex, and puzzle us in our Choice of Sweetne&s;s of Temper and Simplicity of Man|ners, which are the only la&s;ting Charms of Wo|man. But I mu&s;t leave this important Subject at pre&s;ent, for &s;ome Matters which pre&s;s for Publication; as you will ob&s;erve in the following Letter:</P>

<P>'TIS natural for di&s;tant Relations to claim Kindred with a ri&s;ing Family; though, at this Time, Zeal to my Country, not Intere&s;t, calls me out.

Lu&s;tre. A Council of War was lately held, the Honourable Colonel <HI>Mortar</HI> being Pre&s;ident. After many Debates, 'twas unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That Major <HI>Blunder,</HI> a mo&s;t expert Officer, &s;hould be detached for <HI>Bromingham</HI> to buy Arms, and to prove his Fire-locks on the Spot, as well to pre|vent Expence, as Di&s;appointment in the Day of Battle. The Major being a Per&s;on of con&s;ummate Experience, was inve&s;ted with a Di&s;cretionary Power. He knew from ancient Story, that &s;ecu|ring the Rear, and making a glorious Retreat, was the mo&s;t celebrated Piece of Conduct. Ac|cordingly &s;uch Mea&s;ures were taken to prevent Surprize in the Rear of his Arms, that even <HI>Pal|las</HI> her &s;elf, in the Shape of Ru&s;t, could not invade them.

<P>THIS Place being frequented by Per&s;ons of Condition, I am de&s;ired to recommend a Dog-kennel to any who &s;hall want a Pack. It lies not far from <HI>Suffolk-&s;treet,</HI> and is kept by Two who were formerly Dragoons in the <HI>French</HI> Service; but left Plundering for the more order|ly Life of keeping Dogs: Be&s;ides that, according to their Expectation, they find it more profitable, as well as more conducing to the Safety of their Skin, to follow this Trade, than the Beat of Drum. Their Re&s;idence is very convenient for the Dogs to whelp in, and bring up a right Breed to follow the Scent. The mo&s;t eminent of the Kennel are Blood-hounds, which lead the Van, and are as follow:<LIST>
<HEAD>A Li&s;t of the Dogs.</HEAD>
<ITEM><HI>Jowler,</HI> of a right <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Breed, called Captain.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Rockwood,</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Race, with long Hair, by the Courte&s;y of <HI>England</HI> called al&s;o Cap|tain.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pompey,</HI> a tall Hound, kennelled in a <HI>Convent</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and knows a rich Soil.</ITEM>
</LIST> The&s;e Two la&s;t hunt in Couple, and are fol|lowed by,<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Ringwood,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> black Whelp of the &s;ame Breed, a fine open-mouth'd Dog; and an old &s;ick Hound, always in Kennel; but of the true Blood, with a good No&s;e, <HI>French</HI> Breed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="77" REF="81">
There is al&s;o an <HI>Italian</HI> Greyhound, with good Legs, and knows perfectly the Ground from <HI>Ghent</HI> to <HI>Paris.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Ten Setting-Dogs, right <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Four Mongrels, of the &s;ame Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And Twenty Whelps, fit for any Game.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e Curs are &s;o extremely hungry, that they are too keen at the Sport, and worry their Game before the Keepers can come in. The other Day a Wild-Boar from the North ru&s;hed into the Kennel, and at fir&s;t indeed defended him&s;elf a|gain&s;t the whole Pack; but they proved at la&s;t too many for him, and tore 25 Pounds of Fle&s;h from off his Back, with which they filled their Bellies, and made &s;o great a Noi&s;e in the Neigh|bourhood, that the Keepers are obliged to ha&s;ten the Sale. That Quarter of the Town where they are kennell'd is generally inhabited by Strangers, who&s;e Blood the Hounds have often &s;ucked in &s;uch a Manner, that many a <HI>German</HI> Count, and other <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> who came from the Continent, have lo&s;t the Intention of their Travels, and been unable to proceed on their Journey.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Hounds are not very &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed of to &s;ome good Purcha&s;er, as al&s;o tho&s;e at the Ken|nels nearer St. <HI>James</HI>'s, it is humbly propo&s;ed, that they may be altogether tran&s;ported to <HI>America,</HI> where the Dogs are few, and the Wild-Bea&s;ts many. Or, that during their Stay in the&s;e Parts, &s;ome eminent Ju&s;tice of the Peace may have it in particular Direction to vi&s;it their Harbours; and that the Sheriff of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> may allow him the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Common Hang|man to cut off their Ears, or Part of them, for Di&s;tinction-&s;ake, that we may know the Blood|hounds from the Mongrels and Setters. Till the&s;e Things are regulated, you may inquire at an Hou&s;e belonging to <HI>Paris</HI> at the upper End of <HI>Suffolk-Street,</HI> or an Hou&s;e belonging to <HI>Ghent,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="82">
oppo&s;ite to the lower End of <HI>Pull-Mall,</HI> and know further.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that the&s;e Curs were di&s;|po&s;ed of; for it is a very great Nu&s;ance to have them tolerated in Cities. That of <HI>London</HI> takes Care, that the Common Hunt, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Sergeants and Bailiffs, expel them wherever they are found within the Walls; though 'tis &s;aid, &s;ome private Families keep them, to the De&s;tru|ction of their Neighbours: But it is de&s;ired, that all who know of any of the&s;e Curs, or have been bit by them, would &s;end me their Marks, and the Hou&s;es where they are harboured, and I do not doubt but I &s;hall alarm the People &s;o well, as to have them u&s;ed like mad Dogs where|ever they appear. In the mean Time, I advi&s;e all &s;uch as entertain this kind of Vermin, that if they give me timely Notice that their Dogs are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall let them go unregarded, otherwi&s;e am obliged to admoni&s;h my Fellow. Subjects in this Behalf, and in&s;truct them how to avoid being worried, when they are going about their lawful Profe&s;&s;ions and Callings. There was lately a young Gentleman bit to the Bone; who has now indeed recovered his Health, but is as lean as a Skeleton. It grieved my Heart to &s;ee a Gentleman's Son run among the Hounds; but he is, they tell me, as fleet and as dangerous as the be&s;t of the Pack.</P>

<P>This Evening was &s;pent at our Table in Di&s;|cour&s;e of Propriety of Words and Thoughts, which is Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Definition of Wit; but a very odd Fellow, who would intrude upon us, and has a Briskne&s;s of Imagination more like Mad|ne&s;s than regular Thought, &s;aid, that <HI>Harry Jacks</HI> was the fir&s;t who told him of the taking of the Citadel of <HI>Tournay,</HI> and (&s;ays he) <HI>Harry</HI> de|&s;erves a Statue more than the Boy who ran to the Senate with a Thorn in his Foot to tell of a

Victory. We were a&s;toni&s;h'd at the A&s;&s;ertion, and <HI>Spondee</HI> asked him. What Affinity is there be|tween that Boy and <HI>Harry,</HI> that you &s;ay then Merit re&s;embles &s;o much as you ju&s;t now told us? Why, (&s;ays he) <HI>Harry</HI> you know is in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and it was more Pain to him to tell the Story of <HI>Tournay,</HI> than to the Boy to run upon a Thorn to relate a Victory which he was glad of. The Gentleman who was in the Chair upon the Subject of Propriety of Words and Thoughts, would by no Means allow, that there was Wit in this Compari&s;on; and urged, that to have any Thing gracefully &s;aid, it mu&s;t be natural; but that what&s;oever was introduced in common Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;o much Premedita|tion, was in&s;ufferable. That Critick went on: Had Mr. <HI>Jacks</HI> (&s;aid he) told him the Citadel was taken, and another had an&s;wer'd, He de|&s;erves a Statue as well as the <HI>Roman</HI> Boy, for he told it with as much Pain; it might have pa&s;|&s;ed for a &s;prightly Expre&s;&s;ion: But there is a Wit for Di&s;cour&s;e, and a Wit for Writing. The Ea&s;ine&s;s and Familiarity of the fir&s;t, is not to &s;a|vour in the lea&s;t of Study; but the Exactne&s;s of the other, is to admit of &s;omething like the Freedom of Di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially in Treati&s;es of Humanity, and what regards the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> I do not in this allow, that <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI>'s <HI>Tatlers,</HI> or Di&s;cour&s;es of Wit by Retail, and for the Penny, &s;hould come within the De&s;cription of <HI>Writing.</HI> I bowed at his Compliment, and&mdash;But he would not let me proceed.</P>
<P>You &s;ee in no Place of Conver&s;ation the Perfection of Speech &s;o much as in an accompli&s;hed Woman. Whether it be, that there is a Partiality irre&s;i&s;tible when we judge of that Sex, or whatever it is you may ob&s;erve a wonderful Freedom in their Utterance, and an ea&s;y Flow of Words, with|out being di&s;tracted (as we often are who read, much) in the Choice of Dictions and Phra&s;es.

<P>I have been ju&s;t now reading the Introduction to the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Catiliue</HI> by <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> an Author who is very much in my Favour; but when I re|flect upon his profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf wholly di&s;inte|re&s;ted, and at the &s;ame Time &s;ee how indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly he has avoided &s;aying any Thing to the Prai&s;e of <HI>Cicero,</HI> to who&s;e Vigilance the Com|monwealth owed its Safety, it very much le&s;&s;ens my E&s;teem for that Writer; and is one Argument among others, for laughing at all who pretend to be out of the Intere&s;ts of the World, and pro|fe&s;s purely to act for the Service of Mankind, without the lea&s;t Regard to them&s;elves. I do not deny but that the Rewards are different; &s;ome aim at Riches, others at Honour, by their publick Services. However, they are all pur|&s;uing &s;ome End to them&s;elves, though indeed tho&s;e Ends differ as much as Right and Wrong. The mo&s;t graceful Way then, I &s;hould think, would be to acknowledge, that you aim at &s;er|ving your &s;elves; but at the &s;ame Time make it

<P>Of all the di&s;intere&s;ted Profe&s;&s;ors I have ever heard of, I take the Boat&s;wain of <HI>Dampier</HI>'s Ship to be the mo&s;t impudent, but the mu&s;t excu&s;able. You are to know, that in the wild Searches that Navigator was making, they happen'd to be out at Sea, far di&s;tant from any Shore, in Want of all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; in&s;omuch, that they be|gan to look, not without Hunger, on each other. The Boat&s;wain was a fat, healthy, fre&s;h Fellow, and attracted the Eyes of the whole Crew. In &s;uch an extreme Nece&s;&s;ity, all Forms of Superio|rity were laid a&s;ide: The Captain and Lieute|nant were &s;afe only by being Carrion, and the unhappy Boat&s;wain in Danger only by being worth eating. To be &s;hort, the Company were unani|mous, and the Boat&s;wain mu&s;t be cut up. He &s;aw their Intention, and de&s;ired he might &s;peak a few Words before they proceeded; which being permitted, he delivered him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>Far be it that I &s;hould &s;peak it for any private Intere&s;t of my own, but I take it, that I &s;hould not die with a good Con&s;cience, if I did not confe&s;s to you that I am not &s;ound. I &s;ay, Gentlemen, Ju&s;tice, and the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, as well as Love of my Country, to which I hope you will all return, oblige me to own, that Black Kate at <HI>Dept|ford</HI> has made me very un&s;afe to eat; and (I &s;peak it with Shame) I am afraid, Gentlemen, I &s;hould poi&s;on you.</P>

<P>This Speech had a good Effect in the Boat&s;wain's Favour; but the Surgeon of the Ship prote&s;ted, he had cured him very well, and offered to eat the fir&s;t Stake of him him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="86">
The Boat&s;wain replied, (like an Orator, with a true Notion of the People, and in Hopes to gain Time) That he was heartily glad if he could be for their Service, and thanked the Sur|geon for his Information. However, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t inform you, for your own Good, that I have ever &s;ince my Cure been very thir&s;ty and drop&s;ical; therefore I pre&s;ume it would be much better to tap me and drink me off, than eat me at once, and have no Man in the Ship fit to be drank. As he was going on with his Harangue, a fre&s;h Gale aro&s;e, and gave the Crew Hopes of a better Repa&s;t at the neare&s;t Shore, to which they arrived next Morning.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Self-Denials we meet with are of this Sort; therefore I think he acts faire&s;t who owns, he hopes at lea&s;t to have Brother's Fare, without profe&s;&s;ing that he gives him&s;elf up with Plea&s;ure to be devoured for the Pre&s;ervation of his Fellows.</P>

<P>I Have ever thought it the greate&s;t Diminution to the <HI>Roman</HI> Glory imaginable, that in their In&s;titution of Publick Triumphs, they led their Enemies in Chains when they were Pri&s;oners. It is to be allowed, that doing all Honour to the Superiority of Heroes above the re&s;t of Man|kind, mu&s;t needs conduce to the Glory and Ad|vantage of a Nation; but what &s;hocks the Imagination to reflect upon, is, that a polite People &s;hould think it rea&s;onable, that an un|happy Man, who was no Way inferior to the Victor but by the Chance of War, &s;hould be led like a Slave at the Wheels of his Cha|riot. Indeed, the&s;e other Circum&s;tances of a Triumph, That it was not allowed in a Ci|vil War, le&s;t Part of it &s;hould be in Tears, while the other was making Acclamations; That it &s;hould not be granted, except &s;uch a Number were &s;lain in Battle; That the Ge|neral &s;hould be di&s;graced who made a fal&s;e Mu&s;ter of his Dead: The&s;e, I &s;ay, had great and politick Ends in their being e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and ten|ded to the apparent Benefit of the Common|wealth. But this Behaviour to the Conquered
<PB N="85" REF="89">
had no Foundation in Nature or Policy, only to gratify the In&s;olence of an haughty People, who triumphed over barbarous Nations, by acting what was fit only for tho&s;e very Barbarians to practi&s;e. It &s;eems wonderful, that they who were &s;o refined as to take Care, that to compleat the Honour done to the victorious Officer, no Power &s;hould be known above him in the Em|pire on the Day of his Triumph, but that the Con&s;uls them&s;elves &s;hould be but Gue&s;ts at his Table that Evening, could not take it into Thought to make the Man of chief Note among his Pri|&s;oners one of the Company. This would have improved the Gladne&s;s of the Occa&s;ion, and the Victor had made a much greater Figure, in that no other Man appeared unhappy on his Day, than becau&s;e no other Man appeared great.</P>
<P>But we will wave at pre&s;ent &s;uch important In|cidents, and turn our Thoughts rather to the familiar Part of humane Life, and we &s;hall find, that the great Bu&s;ine&s;s we contend for, is in a le&s;s Degree what tho&s;e <HI>Romans</HI> did on more &s;olemn Occa&s;ions, to triumph over our Fellow, Creatures; and there is hardly a Man to be found, who would not rather be in Pain to appear happy, than be really happy and thought mi&s;e|rable. This Men attempt by &s;umptuous Equi|pages, &s;plendid Hou&s;es, numerous Servants, and all the Cares and Pur&s;uits of an ambitious or fa|&s;hionable Life.</P>
<P><HI>Bromeo</HI> and <HI>Tabio</HI> are particularly Ill-wi&s;hers to each other, and Rivals in Happine&s;s. There is no Way in Nature &s;o good to procure the E&s;teem of the one, as to give him little Notices of certain &s;ecret Points wherein the other is unea&s;y. <HI>Gnath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> has the Skill of doing this, and never applauds the Improvements <HI>Bromeo</HI> has been many Years ma|king, and ever will be making; but he adds, <Q REND="inline">'Now this very Thing was my Thought when <HI>Tabio</HI> was pulling up his Underwood, yet he never would

hear of it; but now your Gardens are in this Po&s;ture, he is ready to hand him&s;elf. Well, to be &s;incere, that Situation of his can never make an agreeable Seat: He may make his Hou&s;e and Appurtenances what he plea&s;es; but he cannot remove them to the &s;ame Ground where <HI>Bromeo</HI> &s;tands; and of all Things under the Sun, a Man that is happy at Second-hand is the mo&s;t mon&s;trous."</Q> 'Tis a very &s;trange Madne&s;s (an&s;wers <HI>Bromeo</HI>) if a Man on the&s;e Occa&s;ions can think of any End but plea&s;ing him&s;elf. As for my Part, if Things are convenient, I hate all O&s;tentation: There is no End of the Folly of adapting our Affairs to the Imagination of others. Upon which, the next Thing he does, is to en|large whatever he hears his Rival has attempted to imitate him in; but their Misfortune is, that they are in their Time of Life, in their E&s;tates, and in their Under&s;tandings equal; &s;o that the Emulation may continue to the la&s;t Day of their Lives. As it &s;tands now, <HI>Tabio</HI> has heard <HI>Bromeo</HI> has lately purcha&s;ed Two Hundred a Year in the Annuities &s;ince he has &s;ettled the Account of their Happine&s;s, in which he thought him&s;elf to have the Ballance. This may &s;eem a very fanta&s;tical Way of Thinking in the&s;e Men; but there is nothing &s;o common, as a Man's endea|vouring rather to go further than &s;ome other Per&s;on towards an ea&s;y Fortune, than to form any certain Standard that would make him&s;elf happy.</P>

he, is to be u&s;ed as a Man does his Sword, not to be drawn but in his own Defence, or to bring Pretenders and Impo&s;tors in Society to a true Light.

Thus Cowards, who would hide them&s;elves by an affected Ter|ror in their Mien and Dre&s;s; and Pedants, who would &s;how the Depth of their Knowledge by a &s;upercilious Gravity, are equally the Objects of Laughter. Not that they are in them&s;elves ridiculous for their Want of Courage, or Weak|ne&s;s of Under&s;tanding, but that they &s;eem in&s;en|&s;ible of their own Place in Life, and unhappily rank them&s;elves with tho&s;e, who&s;e Abilities, com|pared to their Defects, make them contemptible.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, it mu&s;t be remarked, That Ri&s;ibility being the Effect of Rea&s;on, a Man ought to be expelled from &s;ober Company who laughs without it. Ha! ha! &s;ays <HI>Will. Truby,</HI> who &s;at by, Will any Man pretend to give me Laws when I &s;hould laugh, or tell me what I &s;hould laugh at? Look ye, an&s;wer'd <HI>Humphrey Slyboots,</HI> you are mightily mi&s;taken; you may, if you plea&s;e, make what Noi&s;e you will, and no Body can hinder an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman from put|ting his Face into what Po&s;ture he thinks fit; but, take my Word for it, that Motion which you now make with your Mouth open, and the Agitation of your Stomach, which you re|lieve by holding your Sides, is not Laughter: Laughter is a more weighty Thing than you imagine; and I'll tell you a Secret, You ne|ver did laugh in your Life; and truly. I am

afraid you never will, except you take great Care to be cured of tho&s;e Convul&s;ive Fits. <HI>Truby</HI> left us, and when he had got Two Yards from us, Well (&s;aid he) you are &s;trange Fellows, and was immediately taken with another Fit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trubies</HI> are a well-natured Family, who&s;e particular Make is &s;uch, that they have the &s;ame Plea&s;ure out of good Will, which other People have in that Scorn which is the Cau&s;e of Laugh|ter: Therefore their bur&s;ting into the Figures of Men, when laughing, proceeds only from a ge|neral Benevolence they are born with; as the <HI>Sly|boots</HI> &s;mile only on the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion of Mirth; which Difference is cau&s;ed rather from a different Structure of their Organs, than that one is le&s;s moved than the other. I know <HI>Sowerly</HI> frets in|wardly when <HI>Will. Truby</HI> laughs at him; but when I meet him, and he bur&s;ts out, I know 'tis out of his abundant Joy to &s;ee me, which he ex|pre&s;&s;es by that Vociferation which is in others Laughter. But I &s;hall defer con&s;idering this Sub|ject at large, till I come to my Treati&s;e of O&s;ci|tation, Laughter, and Ridicule.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that E&s;quire <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> is of all Authors the mo&s;t ingenuous.

<P><HI>Madonella,</HI> who as 'twas thought had long &s;ince taken her Flight towards the Aetherial Man&s;ions, &s;till walks, it &s;eems, in the Regions of Mortality; where &s;he has found, by deep Reflections on the Revolution mentioned in yours of <HI>June</HI> the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, That where early In&s;tructions have been wanting to imprint true Idea's of Things on the tender Souls of tho&s;e of her Sex, they are never after able to arrive at &s;uch a Pitch of Perfection, as to be above the Laws of Matter and Motion; Laws which are con&s;iderably inforced by the Principles u&s;ually imbibed in Nur&s;eries and Boarding-Schools. To remedy this Evil, &s;he has laid the Scheme of a College for young Dam&s;els; where, in&s;tead of Sci&s;&s;ors, Needles, and Samplers; Pens, Compa&s;&s;es, Quadrants, Books, Manu&s;cripts, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, are to take up their whole Time. Only on Holidays the Students will, for moderate Exerci&s;e, be allowed to divert them|&s;elves with the U&s;e of &s;ome of the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t voluble Weapons; and proper Care will be taken to give them at lea&s;t a &s;uperficial Tincture of the An|cient and Modern Amazonian Tacticks.

<P>This Day we have received Advices by the Way of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> which give an Account of an En|gagement between the <HI>French</HI> and the Allies on the 11th In&s;tant, <HI>N.

Body of the Confederates, join'd by the Forces from the Siege, marched up and engaged the Enemy, who were drawn up at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the&s;e Woods.

<P>WHen I lately &s;poke of Triumphs, and the Behaviour of the <HI>Romans</HI> on tho&s;e Occa|&s;ions, I knew by my Skill in A&s;trology, that there was a great Event approaching to our Ad|vantage; but not having yet taken upon me to tell Fortunes, I thought fit to defer the Mention of the Battle near <HI>Mons</HI> till it happened; which Moderation was no &s;mall Pain to me: But I &s;hould wrong my Art, if I conceal'd that &s;ome of my Aerial Intelligencers had &s;ignified to me the News of it ev'n from <HI>Paris,</HI> before the Arri|val of Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Graham</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> All Nations, as well as Per&s;ons, have their good and evil Genius attending 'em; but the King|dom of <HI>France</HI> has Three, the la&s;t of which is neither for it nor again&s;t it in Reality, but has for &s;ome Months pa&s;t acted an ambiguous Part, and attempted to &s;ave its Ward from the Incur|&s;ion of its powerful Enemies, by little Subter|fuges,
<PB N="92" REF="96">
and Tricks, which a Nation is more than undone when it is reduced to Practice. Thus, in&s;tead of giving exact Accounts and Repre&s;enta|tions of Things, they tell what is indeed true, but at the &s;ame Time a Fal&s;hood when all the Circum&s;tances come to be related. <HI>Pacolet</HI> was at the Court of <HI>France</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> Night la&s;t, when this Genius of that Kingdom came thither in the Shape of a Po&s;t-Boy, and cried out, That <HI>Mons</HI> was relieved, and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> marched. <HI>Pacolet</HI> was much a&s;toni&s;hed at this Account, and immediately changed his Form, and flew to the Neighbourhood of <HI>Mons,</HI> from whence he found the Allies had really marched, and began to enquire into the Rea&s;ons of this &s;udden Change, and half feared he had heard a Truth of the Po&s;ture of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs, even in their own Country. But upon diligent En|quiry among the Aerials who attend the&s;e Regi|ons, and Con&s;ultation with the neighbouring Pea|&s;ants, he was able to bring me the following Ac|count of the Motions of the Armies &s;ince they retired from about that Place, and the Action which followed thereupon.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 7th of <HI>September, N. S.</HI> The Confederate Army was alarm'd in their Camp at <HI>Havre,</HI> by Intelligence, That the Enemy were marching to attack the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e.</HI> Upon this Advice, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> command|ed that the Troops &s;hould immediately move, which was accordingly performed, and they were all join'd on <HI>Sunday</HI> the Eighth at Noon. On that Day in the Morning it appeared, that in|&s;tead of being attack'd, the advanced Guard of the Detachment commanded by the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> had di&s;per&s;ed and taken Pri&s;oners a Party of the Enemy's Hor&s;e, which was &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the March of the Confederates. The <HI>French</HI> moved from <HI>Quiverain</HI> on <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Morning and inclined to the Right from thence
<PB N="93" REF="97">
all that Day. The 9th, the <HI>Monday</HI> following, they continued their March till on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the Tenth they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of the Woods of <HI>Dour</HI> and <HI>Blaugies.</HI> As &s;oon as they came into that Ground, they threw up Intrenchments with all Expedition. The Allies arrived within few Hours after the Enemy was po&s;ted; but the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> thought fit to wait for the Arrival of the Reinforcement which he expected from the Siege of <HI>Tournay.</HI> Upon Notice that the&s;e Troops were &s;o far advanced, as to be de|pended on for an Action the next Day, it was ac|cordingly re&s;olv'd to engage the Enemy.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary for under&s;tanding the Great|ne&s;s of the Action, and the &s;everal Motions made in the Time of the Engagement, that you have in your Mind an Idea of the Place. The Two Armies on the 11th In&s;tant were both drawn up before the Woods of <HI>Dour, Blangies, Sart</HI> and <HI>Jan&s;art;</HI> the Army of the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> on the Right before that of <HI>Blangies;</HI> the Forces of <HI>Groat Britain</HI> in the Center on his Left; tho&s;e of the High Allies, with the Wood <HI>Sart,</HI> as well as a large Interval of plain Ground, and <HI>Jan&s;art,</HI> on the Left of the Whole. The Enemy were in|trenched in the Paths of the Woods, and drawn up behind Two Intrenchments over-again&s;t them, oppo&s;ite to the Armies of the Duke of <HI>Marlbo|rough</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene.</HI> There were al&s;o, Two Lines intrenched in the Plains over-again&s;t the Ar|my of the States. This was the Po&s;ture of the <HI>French</HI> and Confederate Forces when the Signal was given and the whole Line moved on to the Charge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, commanded by the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> attack'd with the mo&s;t undaunted Bra|very; and after a very ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, for|ced the fir&s;t Intrenchment of the Enemy in the Plain between <HI>Sart</HI> and <HI>Jan&s;art;</HI> but were repul&s;ed in their Attack on the Second with great Slaughter on both Sides. The Duke of
<PB N="94" REF="98">
<HI>Marlborough,</HI> while this was tranfacting on the Left, had with very much Difficulty marched through <HI>Sart,</HI> and beaten the Enemy from the &s;everal Intrenchments they had thrown up in it. As &s;oon as the Duke had marched into the Plain, he ob&s;erved the main Body of the Enemy drawn up and intrenched in the Front of his Army. This Situation of the Enemy, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of War, is u&s;ually thought an Advantage hardly to be &s;urmounted; and might appear im|practicable to any, but that Army which had ju&s;t overcome greater Difficulties. The Duke com|manded the Troops to form, but to forbear charg|ing till further Order. In the mean Time he vi|&s;ited the Left of our Line, where the Troops of the States had been engaged. The Slaughter on this Side had been very great, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> incapable of making further Progre&s;s, except they were &s;uddenly reinforced. The Right of our Line was attacked &s;oon after their coming upon the Plain; but they drove back the Enemy with &s;uch Bravery, that the Victory began to in|cline to the Allies by the precipitate Retreat of the <HI>French</HI> to their Works, from whence they were immediately beaten. The Duke, upon ob|&s;erving this Advantage on the Right, commanded the Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> to march with a &s;ufficient Number of Battalions to force the Enemy from their Intrenchments on the Plain between the Woods of <HI>Sart</HI> and <HI>Jan&s;art;</HI> which being per|formed, the Hor&s;e of the Allies marched into the Plains, covered by their own Foot, and form|ing them&s;elves in good Order, the Cavalry of the Enemy attempted no more, but to cover the Foot in their Retreat. The Allies made &s;o good U&s;e of the beginning of the Victory, that all their Troops moved on with fre&s;h Re&s;olution, till they &s;aw the Enemy fly before them towards <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Maubeuge;</HI> after whom proper Detach|ments were made, who made a terrible Slaughter in the Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="99">
In this Action it is &s;aid Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was wound|ed, as al&s;o the Duke of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> and Lieutenant-General <HI>Webb.</HI> The Count of <HI>Oxen&s;tern,</HI> Colo|nel <HI>Lalo,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Pendergra&s;s</HI> were kill'd.</P>
<P>This wonderful Succe&s;s, obtain'd under all the Difficulties that could be oppo&s;ed in the Way of an Army, mu&s;t be acknowledged as owing to the Genius, Courage and Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a Con&s;ummate Hero; who has lived not only beyond the Time in which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aid, He was arrived at a Satiety of Life and Glory; but al&s;o been &s;o long the Subject of Panegyrick, that it is as hard to &s;ay any Thing new in his Prai&s;e, as to add to the Merit which requires &s;uch Eulogiums.</P>

<P>I Came hither this Evening, and expected no|thing el&s;e but mutual Congratulations in the Company on the late Victory; but found our Room, which one would have hoped to have &s;een full of good Humour and Alacrity upon &s;o glorious an Occa&s;ion, full of &s;owr Animals, en|quiring into the Action, in Doubt of what had happened, and fearful of the Succe&s;s of their Coun|try-Men. It is natural to believe ea&s;ily what we wi&s;h heartily; and a certain Rule, That they are not Friends to a glad Occa&s;ion, who &s;peak all they can again&s;t the Truth of it; who end their Argument again&s;t our Happine&s;s, that they wi&s;h it otherwi&s;e. When I came into the Room, a Gentleman was declaiming; If (&s;ays he) we have &s;o great and compleat a Victory, Why have we not the Names of the Pri&s;oners? Why is not an exact Relation of the Conduct of our Generals laid be|fore the World? Why do we not know where or whom to applaud? If we are victorious, Why do we not give an Account of our Captives and our Slain? But we are to be &s;atisfy'd with gene|ral Notices we are Conquerors, and to believe it &s;o. Sure this is approving the de&s;potick Way of treating the World, which we pretend to &s;ight again&s;t, if we &s;it down &s;atisfied with &s;uch contradictory Accounts, which have the Words of Triumph, but do not bear the Spirit of it. I whi&s;pered Mr. <HI>Greenhat,</HI> Pray what can that di&s;|&s;atisfied
<PB N="98" REF="102">
Man be? He is, an&s;wered he, a Chara|cter you have not yet perhaps ob&s;erved. You have heard of Battle-Painters, have mentioned a Battle-Poet; but this is a Battle-Critick. He is a Fellow that lives in a Government &s;o gentle, that tho' it &s;ees him an Enemy, &s;uffers his Malice becau&s;e they know his Impotence. He is to exa|mine the Weight of an Advantage before the Company will allow it. <HI>Greenhat</HI> was going on in his Explanation, when Sir <HI>George England</HI> thought fit to take up the Di&s;cour&s;e in the fol|lowing Manner:</P>
<P>Gentlemen, The Action you are in &s;o great Doubt to approve of, is greater than ever has been performed in any Age; and the Value of it I ob|&s;erve from your Di&s;&s;atisfaction: For Battle-Criticks are like all others; you are the more of|fended, the more you ought to be, and are con|vinced you ought to be plea&s;ed. Had this En|gagement happened in the Time of the Old <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> and &s;uch Things been acted in their Ser|vice, there would not be a Foot of the Wood which was pierced but had been con&s;ecrated to &s;ome Deity, or made memorable by the Death of him who expired in it for the Sake of his Coun|try. It had been &s;aid on &s;ome Monument at the Entrance, Here the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> drew his Sword, and &s;aid, March. Here <HI>Webb,</HI> after ha|ving an accompli&s;h'd Fame for Gallantry, expos'd him&s;elf like a common Soldier. Here <HI>Rivett,</HI> who was wounded at the Beginning of the Day, and carried off as dead, returned to the Field, and received his Death. Medals had been &s;truck for our General's Behaviour when he fir&s;t came into the Plain. Here was the Fury of the Action, and here the Hero &s;tood as fearle&s;s as if invul|nerable. Such certainly had been the Cares of that State for their own Honour, and in Grati|tude to their Heroick Subjects. But the Wood entrenched, the Plain made more impa&s;&s;able than
<PB N="99" REF="103">
the Wood, and all the Difficulties oppo&s;ed to the mo&s;t gallant Army, and mo&s;t intrepid Leaders that ever the Sun &s;hone upon, are treated by the Talk of &s;ome in this Room as Objections to the Merit of our General and our Army: But (conti|nued he) I leave all the Examination of this Mat|ter, and a proper Di&s;cour&s;e on our Sen&s;e of pub|lick Actions, to my Friend Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> who may let Beaus and Game&s;ters re&s;t, till he has exa|mined into the Rea&s;ons of Men's being Male|contents, in the only Nation that &s;uffers profe&s;s'd Enemies to breath in open Air.</P>

Had you done your Duty, we &s;hould have had No|tice of their Arrival; but the <HI>Sharpers</HI> are now become &s;o formidable here, that they have di|vided them&s;elves into Nobles and Commons; Beau <HI>Bogg,</HI> Beau <HI>Pert, Rake,</HI> and <HI>Tallboy,</HI> are of their Upper Hou&s;e; Broken Captains, Igno|rant Attorneys, and &s;uch other Bankrupts from indu&s;trious Profe&s;&s;ions, compo&s;e their Lower Order. Among the&s;e Two Sets of Men, there happened here lately &s;ome unhappy Differen|ces: 'Squire <HI>Humphry</HI> came down among us with Four Hundred Guinea's. His raw Ap|pearance, and certain Signals in the good-na|tured Mu&s;cles of <HI>Humphry</HI>'s Countenance, alarmed the Societies: For <HI>Sharpers</HI> are as skil|ful
<PB N="100" REF="104">
as Beggars in Phy&s;iognomy, and know as well where to hope for Plunder, as the others to ask for Alms. <HI>Pert</HI> was the Man exactly fit|ted for taking with <HI>Humphry</HI> as a Fine Gentle|man; for a raw Fool is ever enamoured with his Contrary, a Coxcomb; and a Coxcomb is what the Booby, who wants Experience, and is unus'd to Company, regards as the Fir&s;t of Men. He ever looks at him with Envy, and would certainly be &s;uch, if he were not oppre&s;|&s;ed by his Ru&s;ticity or Ba&s;hfulne&s;s. There a|ro&s;e an intire Friend&s;hip by this Sympathy be|tween <HI>Pert</HI> and <HI>Humphry,</HI> which ended in &s;trip|ping the latter. We now could &s;ee this forlorn Youth for &s;ome Days Monyle&s;s, without Sword, and one Day without his Hat, and with &s;ecret Melancholy pining for his Snuff-box; the Je&s;t of the whole Town, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e who robb'd him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t fre&s;h Bills came down, when imme|diately their Countenances cleared up, ancient Kindne&s;&s;es and Familiarity renew'd, and to Din|ner he was invited by the Fraternity. You are to know, that while he was in his Days of Solitude, a Commoner, who was excluded from his Share of the Prey, had whi&s;pered the 'Squire, that he was bit, and cautioned him of venturing again. However, Hopes of recovering his Snuff-box, which was given him by his Aunt, made him fall to play after Dinner; yet mindful of what he was told, he &s;aw &s;omething that provoked him to tell 'em, they were a Company of <HI>Sharpers.</HI> Pre|&s;ently <HI>Tallboy</HI> &s;ell on him, and being too hard at Fifty-cuffs, drove him out of Doors. The valiant <HI>Pert</HI> followed, and kicked him in his Turn; which the 'Squire re&s;ented, as being nearer his Match; &s;o challenged him: But dif|fering about Time and Place, Friends inter|po&s;ed, (for he had &s;till Money left) and per|&s;waded him to ask Pardon for provoking 'em
<PB N="101" REF="105">
to beat him, and they asked his for doing it. The Hou&s;e con&s;ulting whence <HI>Humphry</HI> could have his Information, concluded it mu&s;t be from &s;ome malicious Commoner; and to be re|venged, Beau <HI>Bogg</HI> watch'd their Haunts, and in a Shop where &s;ome of them were at Play with Ladies, &s;hewed Dice which he found, or pretended to find, upon them; and declaring how fal&s;e they were, warn'd the Company to take Care who they play'd with. By his &s;eem|ing Candour, he cleared his Reputation at lea&s;t to Fools, and &s;ome &s;illy Women: but it was &s;till bla&s;ted by the 'Squire's Story with thinking Men: However, he gain'd a great Point by it; for the next Day he got the Company &s;hut up with him&s;elf and Fellow-Members, and robbed 'em at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s to you with what Indigna|tion I behold the noble Spirit of Gentlemen de|generated to that of private Cut-Pur&s;es. 'Tis in vain to hope a Remedy, while &s;o many of the Fraternity get and enjoy E&s;tates of Twenty, Thirty, and Fifty thou&s;and Pounds with Im|punity, creep into the be&s;t Conver&s;ations, and &s;pread the infectious Villany through the Na|tion, while the le&s;&s;er Rogues, that rob for Hun|ger or Nakedne&s;s, are &s;acrificed by the Blind, and in this Re&s;pect, partial and defective Law. Could you open Mens Eyes again&s;t the Occa|&s;ion of all this, the great Corrupter of our Manners and Morality, the Author of more Bankrupts than the War, and &s;ure Bane of all Indu&s;try, Frugality, and good Nature; in a Word, of all Virtues; I mean, publick or private Play at Cards or Dice; How willingly would I contribute my utmo&s;t, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;end you &s;ome Memoirs of the Lives and Politicks of &s;ome of the Fraternity of great Figure, that might be of U&s;e to you in &s;etting this in a clear Light again&s;t next Se&s;&s;ion, that all who
<PB N="102" REF="106">
care for their Country or Po&s;terity, and &s;ee the pernicious Effects of &s;uch a publick Vice, may endeavour its De&s;truction by &s;ome effectual Laws. In Concurrence to this good De&s;ign, I remain,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Will's Coffee-hou&s;e, <DATE>September 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e this Evening was Eloquence and graceful Action. <HI>Ly&s;an|der,</HI> who is &s;omething particular in his Way of Thinking and Speaking, told us, a Man could not be Eloquent without Action: For the Deportment of the Body, the Turn of the Eye, and an apt Sound to every Word that is utter'd, mu&s;t all con&s;pire to make an accompli&s;h'd Speaker. Action in one that &s;peaks in publick, is the &s;ame Thing as a good Mien in ordinary Life. Thus, as a certain In&s;en&s;ibility in the Countenance re|commends a Sentence of Humour and Je&s;t, &s;o it mu&s;t be a very lively Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that gives Grace to great Sentiments. The Je&s;t is to be a Thing unexpected; therefore your unde&s;igning Manner is a Beauty in Expre&s;&s;ions of Mirth; but when you are to talk on a Set Subject, the more you are moved your &s;elf, the more you will move others.</P>
<P>There is, &s;aid he, a remarkable Example of that Kind. <HI>Ae&s;chines,</HI> a famous Orator of Antiquity, had pleaded at <HI>Athens</HI> in a great Cau&s;e again&s;t <HI>Demo&s;thenes;</HI> but having lo&s;t it, retired to <HI>Rhodes.</HI> Eloquence was then the Quality mo&s;t admired among Men; and the Magi&s;trates of that Place having heard he had a Copy of the Speech of <HI>De|mo&s;thenes,</HI> de&s;ired him to repeat both their Plead|ings. After his own, he recited al&s;o the Oration of his Antagoni&s;t. The People expre&s;&s;ed their Admi|ration of both, but more of that of <HI>Demo&s;thenes.</HI> If you are, &s;aid he, thus touched with hearing only
<PB N="104" REF="108">
what that great Orator &s;aid, How would you have been affected, had you &s;een him &s;peak? For he who hears <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> only, lo&s;es much the better Part of the Oration. Certain it is, that they who &s;peak gracefully, are very lamely re|pre&s;ented in having their Speeches read or repeat|ed by unskilful People; for there is &s;omething native to each Man, &s;o inherent to his Thoughts and Sentiments, which it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for another to give a true Idea of. You may ob&s;erve in common Talk, when a Sentence of any Mans is repeated, an Acquaintance of his &s;hall imme|diately ob&s;erve, <HI>That is &s;o like him, methinks I &s;ee how he look'd when he &s;aid it.</HI></P>
<P>But of all the People on the Earth, there are none who puzzle me &s;o much as the Clergy of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are, I believe, the mo&s;t lear|ned Body of Men now in the World; and yet this Art of Speaking, with the proper Ornaments of Voice and Ge&s;ture, is wholly neglected among them; and I'll engage, were a deaf Man to behold the greater Part of them preach, he would rather think they were reading the Contents only of &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e they intended to make, than actually in the Body of an Oration, even when they are upon Matters of &s;uch a Nature as one would believe it were impo&s;&s;ible to think of without Emotion.</P>
<P>I own there are Exceptions to this general Ob&s;ervation, and that the Dean we heard the other Day together, is an Orator. He has &s;o much Regard to his Congregation, that he com|mits to his Memory what he is to &s;ay to them; and has &s;o &s;oft and graceful a Behaviour, that it mu&s;t attract your Attention. His Per&s;on it is to be confe&s;&s;ed is no &s;mall Recommendation; but he is to be highly commended for not lo&s;ing that Advantage, and adding to the Propriety of Speech (which might pa&s;s the Critici&s;m of <HI>Longinus</HI>) an Action which would have been approved by <HI>De|mo&s;thenes.</HI> He has a peculiar Force in his Way,
<PB N="105" REF="109">
and has many of his Audience who could not be intelligent Hearers of his Di&s;cour&s;e, were there not Explanation as well as Grace in his Action. This Art of his is u&s;ed with the mo&s;t exact and hone&s;t Skill: He never attempts your Pa&s;&s;ions, 'till he has convinced your Rea&s;on. All the Ob|jections which he can form, are laid open and di&s;per&s;ed, before he u&s;es the lea&s;t Vehemence in his Sermon; but when he thinks he has your Head, he very &s;oon wins your Heart; and never pretends to &s;how the Beauty of Holine&s;s, 'till he hath convinced you of the Truth of it.</P>
<P>Would every one of our Clergymen be thus careful to recommend Truth and Virtue in their proper Figures, and &s;how &s;o much Concern for them as to give them all the additional Force they were able, it is not po&s;&s;ible that Non&s;ence &s;hould have &s;o many Hearers as you find it has in Di&s;|&s;enting Congregations, for no Rea&s;on in the World but becau&s;e it is &s;poken <HI>Extempore:</HI> For ordinary Minds are wholly governed by their Eyes and Ears, and there is no Way to come at their Hearts but by Power over their Imaginations.</P>
<P>There is my Friend and merry Companion <HI>Da|niel:</HI> He knows a great deal better than he &s;peaks, and can form a proper Di&s;cour&s;e as well as any Orthodox Neighbour. But he knows very well, that to bawl out, My Beloved; and the Words, Grace! Regeneration! Sanctification! A New Light! The Day! The Day! Ay, my Beloved, the Day! Or rather, The Night! The Night is coming! And Judgment will come, when we lea&s;t think of it! And &s;o forth&mdash;He knows, to be vehement is the only Way to come at his Audience. <HI>Daniel,</HI> when he &s;ees my Friend <HI>Greenhat</HI> come in, can give him a good Hint, and cry out, This is only for the Saints! The Regenerated! By this Force of Action, though mixed with all the Incoherence and Ribaldry ima|ginable, <HI>Daniel</HI> can laugh at his Dioce&s;an, and
<PB N="106" REF="110">
grow fat by voluntary Sub&s;cription, while the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h goes to Law for half his Dues. <HI>Daniel</HI> will tell you, It is not the Shep|herd, but the Sheep with the Bell, which the Flock follows.</P>
<P>Another Thing, very wonderful this learned Body &s;hould omit, is, Learning to read; which is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part of Eloquence in one who is to &s;erve at the Altar: For there is no Man but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the lazy Tone, and inarticulate Sound of our common Readers depreciates the mo&s;t proper Form of Words that were ever extant in any Nation or Language, to &s;peak our own Wants, or his Power from whom we ask Relief.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater In&s;tance of the Power of Action than in little Par&s;on <HI>Dapper,</HI> who is the common Relief to all the lazy Pulpits in Town. This &s;mart Youth has a very good Memory, a quick Eye, and a clean Handkerchief. Thus equip|ped, he opens his Text, &s;huts his Book fairly, &s;hows he has no Notes in his Bible, opens both Palms, and &s;hows all is fair there too. Thus, with a de|ci&s;ive Air, my young Man goes on without He&s;i|tation; and though from the Beginning to the End of his pretty Di&s;cour&s;e, he has not u&s;ed one proper Ge&s;ture, yet at the Conclu&s;ion, the Church-warden pulls his Gloves from off his Head; <HI>Pray, who is this extraordinary young Man?</HI> Thus the Force of Action is &s;uch, that it is more prevalent, even when improper, than all the Rea|&s;on and Argument in the World without it. This Gentleman concluded his Di&s;cour&s;e by &s;aying, I do not doubt, but if our Preachers would learn to &s;peak, and our Readers to read, within Six Months Time we &s;hould not have a Di&s;&s;enter within a Mile of a Church in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

<P>I have a Letter from a young Fellow who com|plains to me, that he was bred a Mercer, and is now ju&s;t out of his Time, but unfortunately (for
<PB N="107" REF="111">
he has no Manner of Education &s;uitable to his pre&s;ent E&s;tate) an Uncle has left him 1000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> The young Man is &s;en&s;ible that he is &s;o &s;pruce, that he fears he &s;hall never be genteel as long as he lives, but applies him&s;elf to me, to know what Method to take to help his Air, and be a Fine Gentleman.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'That &s;everal of tho&s;e Ladies who were formerly his Cu&s;tomers, vi&s;it his Mother on Purpo&s;e to fall in his Way, and fears he &s;hall be obliged to marry again&s;t his Will; for (&s;ays he) if any one of them &s;hould ask me, I &s;hall not be able to deny her. I am (&s;ays he further) utterly at a Lo&s;s how to deal with them; for though I was the mo&s;t pert Creature in the World when I was Foreman, and could hand a Woman of the Fir&s;t Quality to her Coach as well as her own Gentleman U&s;her, I am now quite out of my Way, and &s;peechle&s;s in their Company. They commend my Mode|&s;ty to my Face. No one &s;cruples to &s;ay, I &s;hould certainly make the be&s;t Husband in the World, a Man of my &s;ober Education.&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Wou'd-be</HI> watches all Opportunities to be alone with me: Therefore, good Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> here are my Writings enclo&s;ed; if you can find any Flaw in my Title, &s;o as it may go to the next Heir, who goes to St. <HI>James</HI>'s Cof|fee-hou&s;e, and <HI>White</HI>'s, and could enjoy it, I &s;hould be extremely well plea&s;ed with Two Thou&s;and Pounds to &s;et up my Trade, and live in a Way I know I &s;hould become, rather than be laugh'd at all my Life among too good Com|pany. If you could &s;end for my Cou&s;in, and per&s;wade him to take the E&s;tate on the&s;e Terms, and let no Body know it, you would extremely oblige me.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="112">
Upon fir&s;t Sight, I thought this a very whim&s;ical Propo&s;al; however, upon more mature Con&s;ide|ration, I could not but admire the young Gentle|man's Prudence and good Sen&s;e: For there is no|thing &s;o irk&s;ome, as living in a Way a Man knows he does not become. I con&s;ulted Mr. <HI>Obadiah Greenhat</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, and he is &s;o well plea|&s;ed with the Man, that he has half a Mind to take the E&s;tate him&s;elf; but upon &s;econd Thoughts he propo&s;ed this Expedition. I &s;hould be very willing (&s;aid he) to keep the E&s;tate where it is, if we could make the young Man any Way ea&s;y; therefore I humbly propo&s;e, he &s;hould take to Drinking for one Half-Year, and make a Sloven of him, and from thence begin his Education a|new: For it is a Maxim, That one who is ill taught, is in a wor&s;e Condition than he who is wholly ignorant; therefore a &s;pruce Mercer is farther off the Air of a Fine Gentleman, than a downright Clown. To make our Patient any Thing better, we mu&s;t unmake him what he is. I indeed propo&s;ed to flux him; but <HI>Greenhat</HI> an|&s;wer'd, That if he recovered, he'd be as prim and feat as ever he was: Therefore he would have it his Way; and our Friend is to drink till he is carbuncled, and Tun-bellied; after which we will &s;end him down to &s;moke, and be buried with his Ance&s;tors in <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI> I am indeed de&s;irous he &s;hould have his Life in the E&s;tate, be|cau&s;e he has &s;uch a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of him&s;elf and his Abilities, to know that it is an Unhappine&s;s to him to be a Man of Fortune.</P>
<P>This Youth &s;eems to under&s;tand, that a Gentle|man's Life is that of all others the harde&s;t to pa&s;s through with Propriety of Behaviour; for though he has a Support without Art or Labour, yet his Manner of enjoying that Circum&s;tance is a Thing to be con&s;idered; and you &s;ee among Men who are honoured with the common Appel|lation of Gentlemen, &s;o many Contradictions to
<PB N="109" REF="113">
that Character, that it is the utmo&s;t ill Fortune to bear it: For which Rea&s;on I am oblig'd to change the Circum&s;tances of &s;everal about this Town. <HI>Harry Lacker</HI> is &s;o very exact in his Dre&s;s, that I &s;hall give his E&s;tate to his younger Bro|ther, and make him a Dancing Ma&s;ter. <HI>Nokes Lightfoot</HI> is &s;o nimble, and values him&s;elf &s;o much upon it, that I have Thoughts of making him Hunt&s;man to a Pack of Beagles, and give his Land to &s;ome Body that will &s;tay upon it.</P>
<P>Now I am upon the Topick of becoming what we enjoy, I forbid all Per&s;ons who are not of the fir&s;t Quality, or who do not bear &s;ome important Office that requires &s;o much Di&s;tinction, to go to <HI>Hide-Park</HI> with Six Hor&s;es; for I cannot but e&s;teem it the highe&s;t In&s;olence: Therefore here|after no Man &s;hall do it meerly becau&s;e he is able, without any other Preten&s;ion. But what may &s;erve all Purpo&s;es quite as well, it &s;hall be allowed all &s;uch who think Riches the chief Di|&s;tinction, to appear in the Ring with Two Hor|&s;es only, and a Rent-Roll hanging out of each Side of their Coach. This is a Thought of Mr. <HI>Greenhat</HI>'s, who de&s;igns very &s;oon to publi&s;h a &s;umptuary Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Subject of Equi|page, wherein he will give us Rules on that Sub|ject, and a&s;&s;ign the proper Duties and Qualifica|tions of Ma&s;ters and Servants, as well as that of Husbands and Wives; with a Treati&s;e of Oeco|nomy without Doors, or the compleat Art of ap|pearing in the World. This will be very u&s;eful to all who are &s;uddenly rich, or are a&s;hamed of being poor.</P>

<P>NO Man can conceive, till he comes to try it, how great a Pain it is to be a Publick|&s;pirited Per&s;on.

<P>In order to put the whole Race of Mankind in their proper Di&s;tinctions, according to the Opi|nion their Cohabitants conceived of them, I have with very much Care, and Depth of Meditation, thought fit to erect a Chamber of Fame, and e&s;tabli&s;hed certain Rules, which are to be ob&s;er|ved in admitting Members into this illu&s;trious So|ciety.</P>
<P>In this Chamber of Fame there are to be Three Tables, but of different Lengths; the Fir&s;t is to contain exactly Twelve Per&s;ons; the Second, Twenty; the Third, an Hundred. This is reckon|ed to be the full Number of tho&s;e who have any competent Share of Fame. At the Fir&s;t of the&s;e Tables are to be placed in their Order the Twelve mo&s;t famous Per&s;ons in the World, not with Re|gard to the Things they are famous for, but ac|cording to the Degree of their Fame, whether in Valour, Wit, or Learning. Thus, if a Scholar be more famous than a Soldier, he is to &s;it above him. Neither mu&s;t any Preference be given to Virtue, if the Per&s;on be not equally famous.</P>
<P>When the Fir&s;t Table is filled, the next in Re|nown mu&s;t be &s;eated at the Second, and &s;o on in like Manner to the Number of Twenty; as al&s;o in the &s;ame Order at the Third, which is to hold an Hundred. At the&s;e Tables, no Regard is to be had to Seniority: For if <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;hall be judged more famous than <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> he mu&s;t have the Precedence. No Per&s;on who has not been dead an Hundred Years, mu&s;t be offered to a Place at any of the&s;e Tables: And becau&s;e this is altogether a Lay-Society, and that &s;acred Per&s;ons move upon greater Motives than that of Fame, no Per&s;ons celebrated in holy Writ, or any Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Men what&s;oever, are to be introduced here.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="117">
At the lower End of the Room is to be a Side-Table for Per&s;ons of great Fame, but dubious Exi&s;tence, &s;uch as <HI>Hercules, The&s;eus, Aeneas, A|chilles, Hector,</HI> and others. But becau&s;e it is ap|prehended, that there may be great Contention about Precedence, the Propo&s;er humbly de&s;ires the Opinion of the Learned towards his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance in placing every Per&s;on according to his Rank, that none may have ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of Of|fence.</P>
<P>The Merits of the Cau&s;e &s;hall be judged by Plurality of Voices.</P>
<P>For the more impartial Execution of this im|portant Affair, it is de&s;ired, That no Man will offer his Favourite Hero, Scholar, or Poet; and that the Learned will be plea&s;ed to &s;end to Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> at Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI>'s near <HI>Stationers-Hall,</HI> their &s;everal Li&s;ts for the Fir&s;t Table only, and in the Order they would have them placed; after which the Compo&s;er will compare the &s;eve|ral Li&s;ts, and make another for the Publick, wherein every Name &s;hall be ranked according to the Voices it has had. Under this Chamber is to be a dark Vault for the &s;ame Number of Per|&s;ons of evil Fame.</P>
<P>It is humbly &s;ubmitted to Con&s;ideration, Whe|ther the Project would not be better, if the Per|&s;ons of true Fame meet in a middle Room, tho&s;e of dubious Exi&s;tence in an upper Room, and tho&s;e of evil Fame in a lower dark Room.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, That no Hi&s;torians are to be admitted at any of the&s;e Tables, becau&s;e they are appointed to conduct the &s;everal Per&s;ons to their Seats, and are to be made U&s;e of as U&s;hers to the A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>I call upon the learned World to &s;end me their A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards this De&s;ign, it being a Matter of too great Moment for any one Per&s;on to de|termine. But I do a&s;&s;ure them, their Li&s;ts &s;hall be examined with great Fidelity, and tho&s;e that
<PB N="114" REF="118">
are expo&s;ed to the Publick, made with all the Caution imaginable.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, while I wait for the&s;e Li&s;ts, I am employ'd in keeping People in a right Way, to avoid the contrary to Fame and Applau&s;e, to wit, Blame and Deri&s;ion. For this End, I work upon that u&s;eful Project of the Penny-Po&s;t, by the Benefit of which it is propo&s;ed, that a Chari|table Society be e&s;tabli&s;hed: From which Society there &s;hall go every Day Circular Letters to all Parts within the Bills of Mortality, to tell People of their Faults in a friendly and private Manner, whereby you may know what the World thinks of them, before it is declared to the World that they are thus faulty. This Me|thod cannot fail of univer&s;al good Con&s;equences: For it is further added, that they who will not be reformed by it, mu&s;t be contented to &s;ee the &s;everal Letters printed, which were not regarded by them, that when they will not take private Reprehen&s;ion, they may be tried further by a publick one. I am very &s;orry I am obliged to print the following Epi&s;tles of that Kind to &s;ome Per&s;ons, and the more, becau&s;e they are of the Fair Sex. This went on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t to a very fine Lady.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am highly &s;en&s;ible, that there is nothing of &s;o tender a Nature as the Reputation and Conduct of Ladies; and that when there is the lea&s;t Stain got into their Fame, it is hardly ever to be wa&s;hed out. When I have &s;aid this, you will believe I am extremely concerned, to hear at every Vi&s;it I make, that your Manner of wearing your Hair is a meer Affectation of Beauty; as well as, that your Neglect of Pow|der has been a common Evil to your Sex. It is to you an Advantage to &s;how that Abundance of fine Tre&s;&s;es: But I be&s;eech you to con&s;ider,
<PB N="115" REF="119">
that the Force of your Beauty, and the Imita|tion of you, co&s;ts <HI>Elconora</HI> great Sums of Mo|ney to her Tire-Woman for fal&s;e Locks, be|&s;ides what is allowed to her Maid for keeping the Secret, that &s;he is grey. I mu&s;t take Leave to add to this Admonition, that you are not to reign above Four Months and odd Days longer. Therefore I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to rai&s;e and friz your Hair a little, for it is downright In&s;olence to be thus hand&s;ome without Art; and you'll forgive me for intreating you to do now out of Com|pa&s;&s;ion, what you mu&s;t &s;oon do out of Nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>This Per&s;on dre&s;&s;es ju&s;t as &s;he did before I writ: As does al&s;o the Lady to whom I addre&s;&s;ed the following Billet the &s;ame Day:</P>

<P>This, I thought, had all the Civility and Rea|&s;on in the World in it; but whether my Letters are intercepted, or whatever it is, the Lady patches as &s;he u&s;ed to do.

<P>Of all the pretty Arts in which our modern Writers excel, there is not any which is more to be recommended to the Imitation of Beginners, than the Skill of Tran&s;ition from one Subject to another. I know not whether I make my &s;elf well under&s;tood; but it is certain, that the Way of &s;tringing a Di&s;cour&s;e, u&s;ed in the <HI>Mercury Gal|lant,</HI> the <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> and other learned Writings, not to mention how naturally Things pre&s;ent them&s;elves to &s;uch as harangue in Pulpits, and other Occa&s;ions which occur to the Learned, are Methods worthy Commendation. I &s;hall at|tempt this Style my &s;elf in a few Lines. Suppo&s;e I were di&s;cour&s;ing upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI> The <HI>Bori&s;thenes</HI> is a great River, and puts me in Mind of the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Danube</HI> I cannot think of with|out reflecting on that unhappy Prince who had &s;uch fair Territories on the Banks of it; I mean the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who by our la&s;t Letters is retired from <HI>Mons. Mons</HI> is as &s;trong a Fortifica|tion as any which has no Citadel: And Places which are not compleatly fortified, are, me|thinks, Le&s;&s;ons to Princes, that they are not Om|nipotent, but liable to the Strokes of Fortune. But as all Princes are &s;ubject to &s;uch Calamities, it is the Part of Men of Letters to guard them from the Ob&s;ervations of all &s;mall Writers: For

<P>THE Progre&s;s of our Endeavours will of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity be very much interrupted, except the learned World will plea&s;e to &s;end their Li&s;ts to the Chamber of Fame with all Expedition. There is nothing can &s;o much contribute to create a noble Emulation in our Youth, as the honou|rable Mention of &s;uch who&s;e Actions have out|lived the Injuries of Time, and recommended them&s;elves &s;o far to the World, that it is become Learning to know the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance of their
<PB N="119" REF="123">
Affairs. It is a great Incentive to &s;ee, that &s;ome Men have rai&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o highly above their Fellow Creatures; that the Lives of ordinary Men are &s;pent in Inquiries after the particular Actions of the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious. True it is, that without this Impul&s;e to Fame and Reputation, our Indu&s;try would &s;tagnate, and that lively De&s;ire of plea&s;ing each other die away. This Opinion was &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Heathen World, that their Sen&s;e of Living appeared in&s;ipid, except their Being was enlivened with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that they were e&s;teemed by the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>Upon examining the Proportion of Men's Fame for my Table of Twelve, I thought it no ill Way, &s;ince I had laid it down for a Rule, That they were to be ranked &s;imply as they were fa|mous, without Regard to their Virtue, to ask my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Advice, and particularly mentioned to her the Name of <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> She immediately told me, he was a very great Scholar, and that &s;he had read him at the Boarding-School. She cer|tainly means a Trifle &s;old by the Hawkers, cal|led <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Problems.</HI> But this rai&s;ed a great Scruple in me, Whether a Fame increa&s;ed by Im|po&s;ition of others is to be added to his Account, or that the&s;e Excre&s;cencies, which grow out of his real Reputation, and give Encouragement to others to pa&s;s Things under the Covert of his Name, &s;hould be con&s;idered in giving him his Seat in the Chamber? This Punctilio is referred to the Learned. In the mean Time, &s;o ill-na|tured are Mankind, that I believe I have Names already &s;ent me &s;ufficient to fill up my Li&s;ts for the dark Room, and every one is apt enough to &s;end in their Accounts of ill Defervers. This Malevolence does not proceed from a real Di&s;like of Virtue, but a diabolical Prejudice again&s;t it, which makes Men willing to de&s;troy what they care not to imitate. Thus you &s;ee the greate&s;t Characters among your Acquaintance, and tho&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="124">
you live with, are traduced by all below them in Virtue, who never mention them but with an Ex|ception. However, I believe I &s;hall not give the World much Trouble about filling my Tables for tho&s;e of evil Fame, for I have &s;ome Thoughts of clapping up the <HI>Sharpers</HI> there as fa&s;t as I can lay hold of them.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, I am employed in looking over the &s;everal Notices which I have received of their Manner of Dexterity, and the Way at Dice of making all Rugg, as the Cant is. The whole Art of &s;ecuring a Die, has lately been &s;ent me by a Per|&s;on who was of the Fraternity, but is di&s;abled by the Lo&s;s of a Finger, by which Means he cannot practi&s;e that Trick as he u&s;ed to do. But I am very much at a Lo&s;s how to call &s;ome of the Fair Sex, who are Accomplices with the <HI>Knights of In|du&s;try;</HI> for my Metaphorical Dogs are ea&s;ily enough under&s;tood; but the Feminine Gender of Dogs has &s;o har&s;h a Sound, that we know not how to name it. But I am credibly informed, that there are Fe|male Dogs as voracious as the Males, and make Advances to young Fellows, without any other De&s;ign but coming to a Familiarity with their Pur&s;es. I have al&s;o long Li&s;ts of Per&s;ons of Con|dition, who are certainly of the &s;ame Regimen with the&s;e <HI>Banditti,</HI> and in&s;trumental to their Cheats upon undi&s;cerning Men of their own Rank. The&s;e add their good Reputation to carry on the Impo&s;tures of others, who&s;e very Names would el&s;e be Defence enough again&s;t falling into their Hands. But for the Honour of our Nation, the&s;e &s;hall be unmention'd, provided we hear no more of &s;uch Practices, and that they &s;hall not from henceforward &s;uffer the Society of &s;uch, as they know to be the common Enemies of Order, Di&s;|cipline, and Virtue. If it appear that they go on in encouraging them, they mu&s;t be proceeded again&s;t according to &s;evere&s;t Rules of Hi&s;tory, where all is to be laid before the World

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately read your Di&s;cour&s;e about the Fa|mily of <HI>Trubies,</HI> wherein you ob&s;erve, that there are &s;ome who fall into Laughter out of a cer|tain Benevolence in their Temper, and not out of the ordinary Motive, <HI>viz.</HI> Contempt and Triumph over the Imperfections of others; I have conceived a good Idea of your Knowledge of Mankind. And as you have a Tragi-comick Genius, I beg the Favour of you to give us your Thoughts of a quite different Effect, which al&s;o is cau&s;ed by other Motives than what are commonly taken Notice of. What I would have you treat of, is, the Cau&s;e of &s;hed|ding Tears. I de&s;ire you would di&s;cu&s;s it a little, with Ob&s;ervations upon the various Occa&s;ions which provoke us to that Expre&s;&s;ion of our Con|cern, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>To obey this complai&s;ant Gentleman, I know no Way &s;o &s;hort as examining the various Touches of my own Bo&s;om, on &s;everal Occurrences in a long Life, in the Evening of which I am ar|rived, after as many various Incidents as any Body has met with. I have often reflected, that the e is a great Similitude in the Motions of the Heart in Mirth and in Sorrow; and I think the u&s;ual Occa&s;ion of the latter, as well as the for|mer, is &s;omething which is &s;udden and unexpect|ed. The Mind has not a &s;ufficient Time to recol|lect its Force, and immediately gu&s;hes into Tears before we can utter our &s;elves by Speech or Com|plaint. The mo&s;t notorious Cau&s;es of the&s;e Drops from our Eyes, are Pity, Sorrow, Joy, and Reconciliation.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="126">
The Fair Sex, who are made of Man and not of Earth, have a more delicate Humanity than we have, and Pity is the mo&s;t common Cau&s;e of their Tears: For as we are inwardly compo&s;ed of an Aptitude to every Circum&s;tance of Life, and every Thing that befalls any one Per&s;on, might have happened to any other of humane Race; Self-love, and a Sen&s;e of the Pain we our &s;elves &s;hould &s;uffer in the Circum&s;tances of any whom we pity, is the Cau&s;e of that Compa&s;&s;ion. Such a Reflection in the Brea&s;t of a Woman, imme|diately inclines her to Tears; but in a Man, it makes him think how &s;uch a one ought to act on that Occa&s;ion, &s;uitably to the Dignity of his Nature. Thus a Woman is ever moved for tho&s;e whom &s;he hears lament, and a Man for tho&s;e whom he ob&s;erves to &s;uffer in Silence. It is a Man's own Behaviour in the Circum&s;tances he is under which procures him the E&s;teem of others, and not meerly the Affliction it &s;elf which de|mands our Pity: For we never give a Man that Pa&s;&s;ion which he falls into for him&s;elf. He that commends him&s;elf, never purcha&s;es our Applau&s;e; nor he who bewails him&s;elf, our Pity.</P>
<P>Going through an Alley the other Day, I ob|&s;erved a noi&s;y impudent Beggar bawl out, That he was wounded in a Merchant-man; That he had lo&s;t his poor Limbs, and &s;howed a Leg clouted up. All that pa&s;&s;ed by, made what ha&s;te they could out of his Sight and Hearing; but a Poor Fellow at the End of the Pa&s;&s;age, with a ru&s;ty Coat, a melancholy Air, and a &s;oft Voice, de&s;ired them to look upon a Man not u&s;ed to beg. The latter received the Charity of almo&s;t every one that went by. The Strings of the Heart, which are to be touched to give us Compa&s;&s;ion, are not &s;o played on but by the fine&s;t Hand. We &s;ee in Tragical Repre&s;entations, it is not the Pomp of Language, or Magnificence of Dre&s;s, in which the
<PB N="123" REF="127">
Pa&s;&s;ion is wrought that touches &s;en&s;ible Spirits, but &s;omething of a plain and &s;imple Nature which breaks in upon our Souls, by that Sympathy which is given us for our mutual Good-will and Service.</P>
<P>In the Tragedy of <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> where <HI>Wilks</HI> acts the Part of a Man who&s;e Family has been mur|dered in his Ab&s;ence, the Wildne&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, which is run over in a Torrent of calamitous Circum&s;tances, does but rai&s;e my Spirits, and give me the Alarm; but when he skilfully &s;eems to be out of Breath, and is brought too low to &s;ay more; and upon a &s;econd Reflection, cry, only wiping his Eyes, <HI>What both Children! Both, both my Children gone!</HI>&mdash;There is no re&s;i&s;ting a Sor|row which &s;eems to have ca&s;t about for all the Rea&s;ons po&s;&s;ible for its Con&s;olation, but has no Recour&s;e. <HI>There is not one left, but both, both are murdered!</HI> Such &s;udden Starts from the Thread of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and a plain Sentiment expre&s;&s;ed in an artle&s;s Way, are the irre&s;i&s;tible Strokes of Eloquence and Poetry. The &s;ame great Ma&s;ter, <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> can afford us In&s;tances of all the Places where our Souls are acce&s;&s;ible, and ever commands our Tears: But it is to be ob&s;erved, that he draws them from &s;ome unex|pected Source, which &s;eems not wholly of a Piece with the Di&s;cour&s;e. Thus, when <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> had a Debate in the Tragedy of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and ro&s;e to warm Language again&s;t each other, in&s;omuch that it had almo&s;t come to &s;omething that might be fatal, till they recollected them|&s;elves; <HI>Brutus</HI> does more than make an Apology for the Heat he had been in, by &s;aying, <HI>Porcia is dead</HI>&mdash;Here <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> is all Tenderne&s;s, and ready to di&s;&s;olve, when he con&s;iders, that the Mind of his Friend had been employed on the greate&s;t Affliction imaginable, when he had been adding to it by a Debate on Trifles; which makes him in the Angui&s;h of his Heart cry out, <HI>How &s;caped I killing, when I thus provoked you?</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="128">
This is an Incident which moves the Soul in all its Sentiments; and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI>'s Heart was at once touched with all the &s;oft Pangs of Pity, Remor&s;e, and Reconciliation. It is &s;aid indeed by <HI>Horace, If you would have me weep, you mu&s;t fir&s;t weep your &s;elf.</HI> This is not literally true, for it would have been as rightly &s;aid, if we ob&s;erve Nature, That I &s;hall certainly weep, if you do not: But what is intended by that Expre&s;&s;ion, is, That it is not po&s;&s;ible to give Pa&s;&s;ion, except you &s;how that you &s;uffer your &s;elf. Therefore the true Art &s;eems to be, that when you would have the Per|&s;on you repre&s;ent pitied, you mu&s;t &s;how him at once, in the highe&s;t Grief and Struggling, to bear it with Decency and Patience. In this Ca&s;e, we &s;igh for him, and give him every Groan he &s;uppre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I remember, when I was young enough to follow the Sports of the Field, I have more than once rode off at the Death of a Deer, when I have &s;een the Animal in an Affliction which ap|peared humane without the lea&s;t Noi&s;e, let fall Tears when he was reduced to Extremity; and I have thought of the Sorrow I &s;aw him in when his Haunch came to the Table. But our Tears are not given only to Objects of Pity, but the Mind has Recour&s;e to that Relief in all Oc|ca&s;ions which give us much Emotion. Thus to be apt to &s;hed Tears, is a Sign of a great as well as little Spirit. I have heard &s;ay, the pre|&s;ent Pope never pa&s;&s;es through the People, who always kneel in Crowds and ask his Benediction, but the Tears are &s;een to flow from his Eyes. This mu&s;t proceed from an Imagination, that he is the Father of all tho&s;e People, and that he is touched with &s;o exten&s;ive a Benevolence, that it breaks out into a Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears. You &s;ee Friends, who have been long ab&s;ent, tran&s;ported in the &s;ame Manner: A Thou&s;and little Images crowd upon them at their Meeting, as all the Joys and Griefs they have known during their
<PB N="125" REF="129">
Separation; and in one Hurry of Thought, they conceive how they &s;hould have participated in tho&s;e Occa&s;ions; and weep, becau&s;e their Minds are too full to wait the &s;low Expre&s;&s;ion of Words.</P>

<P>There is lately broke loo&s;e from the <HI>London</HI> Pack, a very tall dangerous Biter. He is now at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and it is feared will make a damnable Havock a|mongst the Game.

<P>IT is, as far as it relates to our pre&s;ent Being, the great End of Education to rai&s;e our &s;elves above the Vulgar; but what is intended by the Vulgar, is not, methinks, enough under&s;tood. In me, indeed, that Word rai&s;es a quite different Idea from what it u&s;ually does in others; but perhaps that proceeds from my being old, and beginning to want the Reli&s;h of &s;uch Satisfactions as are the ordinary Entertainment of Men. How|ever &s;uch as my Opinion is in this Ca&s;e, I will &s;peak it; becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible that Turn of Thought may be received by others, who may reap as much Satisfaction from it as I do my &s;elf.</P>
<P>It is to me a very great Meanne&s;s, and &s;ome|thing much below a Philo&s;opher, which is what I mean by a Gentleman, to rank a Man among the Vulgar for the Condition of Life he is in, and not according to his Behaviour, his Thoughts and Sentiments, in that Condition. For if a Man be loaded with Riches and Honours, and in that State of Life has Thoughts and Inclinations be|low the meane&s;t Artificer; is not &s;uch an Artifi|cer, who within his Power is good to his Friends, moderate in his Demands for his Labour, and chearful in his Occupation, very much &s;uperior to him who lives for no other End but to &s;erve him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;umes a Preference in all his Words and Actions to tho&s;e, who act their Part with
<PB N="127" REF="131">
much more Grace than him&s;elf? <HI>Epictetus</HI> has made u&s;e of the Similitude of a Stage-Play to hu|mane Life with much Spirit. It is not, &s;ays he, to be con&s;idered among the Actors, who is Prince, or who is Beggar, but who acts Prince or Beg|gar be&s;t. The Circum&s;tance of Life &s;hould not be that which gives us Place, but our Behaviour in that Circum&s;tance is what &s;hould be our &s;olid Di&s;tinction. Thus, a wi&s;e Man &s;hould think no Man above him or below him, any further than it regards the outward Order and Di&s;cipline of the World: For if we take too great an Idea of the Eminence of our Superiors, or Subordina|tion of our Inferiors, it will have an ill Effect up on our Behaviour to both. He who thinks no Man above him but for his Virtue, none below him but for his Vice, can never be ob&s;equious or a&s;&s;uming in a wrong Place, but will frequently emulate Men in Rank below him, and pity tho&s;e above him.</P>
<P>This Sen&s;e of Mankind is &s;o far from a levelling Principle, that it only &s;ets us upon a true Ba&s;is of Di&s;tinction, and doubles the Merit of &s;uch as be|come their Condition. A Man in Power, who can, without the ordinary Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which &s;top the Way to the true knowledge and Service of Mankind, over-look the little Di&s;tinctions of Fortune, rai&s;e ob&s;cure Merit, and di&s;countenance &s;ucce&s;sful Inde&s;ert, has, in the Minds of knowing Men, the Figure of an Angel rather than a Man, and is above the re&s;t of Men in the highe&s;t Cha|racter he can be, even that of their Benefactor.</P>
<P>Turning my Thoughts as I was taking my Pipe this Evening after this Manner, it was no &s;mall Delight to me to receive Advice from <HI>Felicia,</HI> That <HI>Eboracen&s;is</HI> was appointed a Governour of one of their Plantations. As I am a great Lover of Man|kind, I took Part in the Happine&s;s of that People who were to be governed by one of &s;o great Hu|manity, Ju&s;tice, and Honour. <HI>Eboracen&s;is</HI> has read
<PB N="128" REF="132">
all the Schemes which Writers have formed of Government and Order, and been long conver|&s;ant with Men who have the Reins in their Hands; &s;o that he can very well di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween Chimaerical and Practical Politicks. It is a great Ble&s;&s;ing (when Men have to deal with &s;uch different Characters in the &s;ame Species as tho&s;e of Free-Men and Slaves) that they who command have a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of humane Nature it &s;elf, by which they can temper the Haughtine&s;s of the Ma&s;ter, and &s;often the Servitude of the Slave. <HI>Hae tibi erunt Artes.</HI> This is the Notion with which tho&s;e of the Plantation receive <HI>Ebo|racen&s;is:</HI> And as I have ca&s;t his Nativity, I find it will be a Record made of this Per&s;on's Ad|mini&s;tration; and on that Part of the Shore from whence he embarks to return from his Government, there will be a Moument with the&s;e Words; <HI>Here the People wept, and took Leave of</HI> Eboracen&s;is, <HI>the fir&s;t Governour our Mo|ther</HI> Felicia <HI>&s;ent, who, during his Command here, believed him&s;elf her Subject.</HI></P>

<P>THere are Two Ladies, who having a good Opinion of your Ta&s;t and Judgment, de&s;ire you to make U&s;e of them in the following Par|ticular, which perhaps you may allow very ex|traordinary. The Two Ladies before mention'd, have a con&s;iderable Time &s;ince contracted a more &s;incere and con&s;tant Friend&s;hip than their Adver&s;aries the Men will allow con&s;i&s;tent with the Frailty of Female Nature; and being from a long Acquaintance convinced of the perfect Agreement of their Tempers, have thought up|on an Expedient to prevent their Separation,

The Gentleman they have pitch'd upon, is neither well-bred nor agreeable, his Under&s;tanding moderate, and his Per&s;on never de&s;igned to charm Women; but having &s;o much Self-Intere&s;t in his Nature, as to be &s;atisfied with making double Contracts, upon Condition of receiving double Fortunes; and mo&s;t Men being &s;o far &s;en&s;ible of the Unea&s;ine&s;s that one Woman occa&s;ions, they think him for the&s;e Rea&s;ons the mo&s;t likely Per&s;on of their Ac|quaintance to receive the&s;e Propo&s;als. Upon all other Accounts, he is the la&s;t Man either of them would chu&s;e, yet for this preferable to all the re&s;t.

<P>This is very extraordinary, and much might be objected by me, who am &s;omething of a Ci|vilian, to the Ca&s;e of Two marrying the &s;ame Man; but the&s;e Ladies are, I perceive, Free-Thinkers, and therefore I &s;hall &s;peak only to the prudential Part of this De&s;ign, meerly as a Phi|lo&s;opher, without entring into the Merit of it in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil Law. The&s;e con&s;tant Friends, <HI>Piledea</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tea,</HI> are at a Lo&s;s to pre&s;erve their Friend&s;hip from the Encroach|ments of Love, for which End they have re&s;olved upon a Fellow who cannot be the Object of Af|fection
<PB N="130" REF="134">
or E&s;teem to either, and con&s;equently cannot rob one of the Place each has in her Friend's Heart. But in all my Reading, (and I have read all that the Sages in Love have writ) I have found the greate&s;t Danger in Jealou&s;y. The Ladies indeed, to avoid this Pa&s;&s;ion, chu&s;e a &s;ad Fellow; but if they would be advi&s;ed by me, they had better have each their worthle&s;s Man; otherwi&s;e, he that was de&s;picable while he was indifferent to them, will become valuable when he &s;eems to prefer one to the other.</P>
<P>I remember in the Hi&s;tory of Don <HI>Quixot</HI> of the <HI>Manca,</HI> there is a memorable Pa&s;&s;age which opens to us the Weakne&s;s of our Nature in &s;uch Particu|lars. The Don falls into Di&s;cour&s;e with a Gen|tleman whom he calls the Knight of the <HI>Green-Ca&s;|&s;ock,</HI> and is invited to his Hou&s;e. When he comes there, he runs into Di&s;cour&s;e and Panegyrick up|on the Oeconomy, the Government and Order of his Family, the Education of his Children; and la&s;tly, on the &s;ingular Wi&s;dom of him who di&s;po&s;ed Things with that Exactne&s;s. The Gen|tleman makes a Soliloquy to him&s;elf, Oh irre&s;i|&s;tible Power of Flattery! 'Though I know this is a Mad-man, I cannot help being taken with his Applau&s;e. The Ladies will find this much more true in the Ca&s;e of their Lover; and the Woman be mo&s;t likes, will certainly be more plea&s;ed; &s;he whom he &s;lights, more offended, than &s;he can imagine before &s;he has tried. Now I humbly propo&s;e, That they both marry Cox|combs whom they are &s;ure they cannot like, and then they may be pretty &s;ecure again&s;t the Change of Affection, which they fear; and by that Means, pre&s;erving the Temperature under which they now write, enjoy during Life, <HI>Equal Day and Night.</HI></P>

<P>HAving read your Lucubrations of the 10th In&s;tant, I can't but entirely agree with you in your Notions of the Scarcity of Men who can either read or &s;peak. For my Part, I have lived the&s;e 30 Years in the World, and yet have ob|&s;erved but a very few who could do either in any tolerable Manner; among which few, you mu&s;t under&s;tand that I reckon my &s;elf. How far Eloquence, &s;et off with the proper Orna|ments of Voice and Ge&s;ture, will prevail over the Pa&s;&s;ions, and how cold and unaffecting the be&s;t Oration in the World would be without them, there are Two remarkable In&s;tances in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Ligarius</HI> and that of <HI>Milo. Cae&s;ar</HI> had condemned <HI>Ligarius.</HI> He came indeed to hear what might be &s;aid; but thinking him&s;elf his own Ma&s;ter, re&s;olved not to be bya&s;&s;ed by any Thing <HI>Cicero</HI> could &s;ay in his Behalf: But in this he was mi&s;taken; for when the Orator began to &s;peak, the Hero is moved, he is van|qui&s;h'd, and at length the Criminal ab&s;olved. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this famous Orator was le&s;s renown'd for his Courage than his Eloquence; for though he came at another Time, prepared to defend <HI>Milo</HI> with one of the be&s;t Orations that Antiquity has produced; yet being &s;eized with a &s;udden Fear by &s;eeing &s;ome armed Men &s;urrounding the <HI>Forum,</HI> he falter'd in his Speech, and became unable to exert that irre&s;i&s;tible Force and Beauty of Action which would have &s;aved his Client, and for Want of which he was con|demned to Bani&s;hment. As the Succe&s;s the for|mer of the&s;e Orations met with, appears chief|ly owing to the Life and graceful Manner with
<PB N="134" REF="138">
which it was recited, (for &s;ome there are who think it may be read without Tran&s;port) &s;o the latter &s;eems to have failed of Succe&s;s for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the Orator was not in a Condition to &s;et it off with tho&s;e Orna|ments. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that artful Sound will with the Crowd prevail even more than Sen&s;e; but tho&s;e who are Ma&s;ters of both, will ever gain the Admiration of all their Hearers: And there is, I think, a very natural Account to be given of this Matter; for the Sen&s;ation of the Head and Heart are cau&s;ed in each of the&s;e Parts by the outward Organs of the Eye and Ear: That therefore which is conveyed to the Under&s;tanding and Pa&s;&s;ions by only one of the&s;e Organs, will not affect us &s;o much as that which is tran&s;mitted through both. I can't but think your Charge is ju&s;t again&s;t a great Part of the learned Clergy of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who de|liver the mo&s;t excellent Di&s;cour&s;es with &s;uch Coldne&s;s and Indifference, that 'tis no great Wonder the unintelligent Many of their Con|gregations fall a&s;leep. Thus it happens that their Orations meet with a quite contrary Fate to that of <HI>Deme&s;thenes</HI> you mentioned; for as that lo&s;t much of its Beauty and Force by be|ing repeated to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Rhodes</HI> with|out the winning Action of that great Orator, &s;o the Performances of the&s;e Gentlemen never appear with &s;o little Grace, and to &s;o much Di&s;|advantage, as when delivered by them&s;elves from the Pulpit. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> being &s;ent for to a Patient in this City, and having felt his Pul&s;e, enquired into the Symptoms of his Di&s;temper, and finding that it proceeded in a great Mea&s;ure from Want of Sleep, advi&s;es his Patient, with an Air of Gravity, to be carried to Church to hear a Sermon, not doubting but that it would di&s;po&s;e him for the Re&s;t he wanted. If &s;ome of the Rules <HI>Horace</HI> gives for the Theatre,
<PB N="135" REF="139">
were (not improperly) applied to our Pulpits, we &s;hould not hear a Sermon pre&s;cribed as a good Opiate.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t</L>
<L>Primum ip&s;i tibi &mdash;</L></Q>
<P>A Man mu&s;t him&s;elf expre&s;s &s;ome Concern and Affection in delivering his Di&s;cour&s;e, if he expects his Auditory &s;hould intere&s;t them&s;elves in what he propo&s;es: For otherwi&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding the Dignity and Importance of the Sub|ject he treats of; notwith&s;tanding the Weight and Argument of the Di&s;cour&s;e it &s;elf; yet too many will &s;ay,<Q><L>&mdash; Male &s;i Mandata loqueris,</L>

<P>If there be a Deficiency in the Speaker, there will not be a &s;ufficient Attention and Regard paid to the Things &s;poken: But, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you know, that as too little Action is cold, &s;o too much is ful&s;ome. Some indeed may think them&s;elves accompli&s;hed Speakers, for no other Rea&s;on than becau&s;e they can be loud and noi&s;y; (for &s;urely <HI>Stentor</HI> mu&s;t have &s;ome De&s;ign in his Vociferations.) But, dear Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> convince them, that as har&s;h and irregu|lar Sound is not Harmony; &s;o neither is bang|ing a Cu&s;hion, Oratory: And therefore, in my humble Opinion, a certain Divine of the Fir&s;t Order, whom I allow otherwi&s;e to be a great Man, would do well to leave this off; for I think, his Sermons would be more per&s;wa|&s;ive, if he gave his Auditory le&s;s Di&s;turbance. Though I cannot &s;ay, that this Action would be wholly improper to a prophane Oration; yet, I think, in a Religious A&s;&s;embly, it gives a Man too Warlike, or perhaps too Theatrical

<P>I Read with great Plea&s;ure in the <HI>Tatler</HI> of <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t the Conver&s;ation upon Elo|quence; permit me to hint to you one Thing the great <HI>Roman</HI> Orator ob&s;erves upon this Sub|ject, <HI>Caput enim arbitrabatur Oratoris,</HI> (he quotes <HI>Menedemus</HI> an <HI>Athenian</HI>) <HI>ut ip&s;is apud quos ageret talis qualem ip&s;e optaret videretur, id fieri Vitae Dignitate.</HI> It is the fir&s;t Rule in Oratory, That a Man mu&s;t appear &s;uch as he would per|&s;wade others to be, and that can be accompli&s;h'd only by the Force of his Life. I believe it might be of great Service to let our publick Orators know, That an unnatural Gravity, or an unbe|coming Levity in their Behaviour out of the Pulpit, will take very much from the Force of then Eloquence in it. Excu&s;e another Scrap of <HI>Latin;</HI> 'tis from one of the Fathers: I think it will appear a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation to all, as it may have Authority with &s;ome; <HI>Qui autem do|cent tantum, nec faciunt, ip&s;i Praeceptis &s;uis detra|hunt Pondus; Quis enim obtemperet, cum ip&s;i Praeceptores doceant non obtemperare?</HI> I am,</P>

<P>OB&s;erving you are not content with la&s;hing the many Vices of the Age, without illu&s;trating each with particular Characters, it's thought no|thing would more contribute to the Impre&s;&s;ion you de&s;ign by &s;uch, than always having regard to Truth. In your <HI>Tatler</HI> of this Day, I ob&s;erve you allow, That nothing is &s;o tender as a Lady's Repu|tation; that a Stain once got in their Fame, is hard|ly ever to be wa&s;hed out. This you grant even when you give your &s;elf Leave to trifle. If &s;o, What Cau|tion is nece&s;&s;ary in handling the Reputation of a Man, who&s;e well-being in this Life perhaps entirely depends on pre&s;erving it from any Wound, which once there received, too often becomes fatal and in|curable? Suppo&s;e &s;ome villainous Hand, through Per&s;onal Prejudice, tran&s;mits Materials for this Purpo&s;e, which you publi&s;h to the World, and after|wards
<PB N="141" REF="147">
become fully convinced you were impo&s;ed on; (us by this Time you may be of a Character you have &s;ent into the World;) I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing this, I would be glad to know, what Reparation you think ought to be made the Per&s;on &s;o injured, admitting you &s;tood in his Place. It has always been held, that a generous Education is the &s;ure&s;t Mark of a generous Mind. The former is indeed per&s;picuous in all your Papers; and I am per&s;waded, tho' you affect often to &s;hew the latter, yet you would not keep any Mea&s;ures (even of Chri&s;tianity) with tho&s;e who &s;hould handle you in the Manner you do others. The Application of all this is from your having very lately glanced at a Man, under a Character, that were he con&s;cious to de&s;erve, he would be the fir&s;t to rid the World of him&s;elf; and would be more ju&s;ti|fiable in it to all Sorts of Men, than you in your com|mitting &s;uch a Violence on his Reputation, which perhaps you may be convinced of in another Manner than you de&s;erve from him.</P>
<P>A Man of your Capacity, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;hould have more noble Views, and pur&s;ue the true Spirit of Satyr; but I will conclude, le&s;t I grow out of Temper, and will only beg for your own Pre&s;ervation, to remember the Proverb of the Pitcher.</P>

<P>The Proverb of the Pitcher I have no Regard to; but it would be an In&s;en&s;ibility not to be par|doned, if a Man could be untouched at &s;o warm an Accu&s;ation, and that laid with &s;o much &s;eem|ing Temper. All I can &s;ay to it is, That if the Writer, by the &s;ame Method whereby he con|veyed this Letter, &s;hall give me an In&s;tance wherein I have injured any good Man, or point|ed at any Thing which is not the true Object of Raillery, I &s;hall acknowledge the offence in as open a Manner as the Pre&s;s can do it, and lay down this Paper for ever.</P>

There is &s;omething very terrible in unju&s;tly at|tacking Men in a Way that may prejudice their Honour or Fortune; but when Men of too Mode&s;t a Sen&s;e of them&s;elves will think they are touched, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent ill Con&s;equences from the mo&s;t innocent and general Di&s;cour&s;es. This I have known happen in Circum&s;tances the mo&s;t foreign to theirs who have taken Offence at them. An Adverti&s;ement lately publi&s;hed, rela|ting to <HI>Omicron,</HI> alarmed a Gentleman of good Sen&s;e, Integrity, Honour, and Indu&s;try, which is, in every Particular, different from the trifling Pretenders pointed at in that Adverti&s;ement. When the Mode&s;ty of &s;ome is as exce&s;&s;ive as the Vanity of others, What Defence is there again&s;t Mi&s;interpretation? However, giving Di&s;turbance, though not intended, to Men of virtuous Cha|racters, has &s;o &s;incerely troubled me, that I will break from this Satyrical Vein; and to &s;how I very little value my &s;elf upon it, &s;hall for this Month en&s;uing, leave the <HI>Sharper,</HI> the <HI>Fop,</HI> the <HI>Pedant,</HI> the <HI>Proud Man,</HI> the <HI>In&s;olent;</HI> in a Word, all the Train of <HI>Knaves</HI> and <HI>Fools,</HI> to their own Devices, and touch on nothing but Panegyrick. This Way is &s;uitable to the true Genius of the <HI>Staffs,</HI> who are much more inclined to reward than puni&s;h. If therefore the Author of the Above-mention'd Let|ter does not command my Silence wholly, as he &s;hall if I do not give him Satisfaction, I &s;hall for the above-mentioned Space turn my Thoughts to rai&s;ing Merit from its Ob&s;curity, celebrating Virtue in its Di&s;tre&s;s, and attacking Vice by no other Me|thod, but &s;etting Innocence in a proper Light.</P>

Another evil Faculty he has, in making the Bowling-Green his daily Re&s;i|dence, in&s;tead of his Church, where his Curate reads Prayers every Day. If the Weather is fair, his Time is &s;pent in Vi&s;iting; if Cold or Wet, in Bed, or at lea&s;t at Home, though within 100 Yards of the Church. The&s;e out of many &s;uch irregular Practices, I write for his Reclaimation: But two or three Things more before I conclude; to wit, that generally when his Curate preaches in the After|noon, he &s;leeps &s;otting in the Desk on a Hi&s;&s;ock.

Long &s;he &s;tood in this Agony of alternate Rage and Love; but at la&s;t compo&s;ed her &s;elf for her Di&s;&s;olution, rather than &s;urvive her beloved <HI>Pae|tus.</HI> When he came into her Pre&s;ence, he found her with the Tyrant's Letter in one Hand, and a Dagger in the other. Upon his Approach to her, &s;he gave him the Order; and at the &s;ame Time &s;tabbing her &s;elf, <HI>Paetus</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>it is not pain|ful,</HI> and expired. <HI>Paetus</HI> immediately followed her Example. The Pa&s;&s;ion of the&s;e memorable Lovers was &s;uch, that it illuded the Rigour of their Fortune, and baffled the Force of a Blow, which neither felt, becau&s;e each received it for the Sake of the other. The Woman's Part in this Story is by much the more Heroick, and has occa&s;ioned one of the be&s;t Epigrams tran&s;mitted to us from Antiquity:</P>
<Q><L>When <HI>Arria</HI> pull'd the Dagger from her Side,</L>

<P>BEing of that Part of Chri&s;tians whom Men call <HI>Quakers;</HI> and being a Seeker of the Right Way, I was per&s;waded Ye&s;terday to hear one of your mo&s;t noted Teachers. The Matter he treated, was the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Well-living,
<PB N="149" REF="155">
grounded upon a future State. I was atten|tive; but the Man did not appear in earne&s;t. He read his Di&s;cour&s;e (notwith&s;tanding thy Re|bukes) &s;o heavily, and with &s;o little Air of be|ing convinced him&s;elf, that I thought he would have &s;lept, as I ob&s;erved many of his Hearers did. I came Home unedified, and troubled in Mind. I dip'd into the <HI>Lamentations,</HI> and from thence turning to the 34th Chapter of <HI>Exekiel,</HI> I found the&s;e Words; <HI>We be to the Shepherds of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that do feed them&s;elves! Should not the Shepherds feed the Flock? Ye eat the Fat, and ye cloath you with the Wool: Ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the Flock. The Di&s;ea&s;ed have ye not &s;trengthen'd; neither have ye heal'd that which was &s;ick; neither have ye bound up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; neither have ye &s;ought that which was lo&s;t; but with Force and with Cruelty have ye ruled them,</HI> &amp;c. Now I pray thee, Friend, as thou art a Man skill'd in many Things, tell me, Who is meant by the <HI>Di&s;eas'd,</HI> the <HI>Sick,</HI> the <HI>Broken,</HI> the <HI>Driven away,</HI> and the <HI>Lo&s;t?</HI> And whether the Prophecy in this Chapter be accompli&s;h'd, or yet to come to pa&s;s?

<P>This Matter is too &s;acred for this Paper; but I can't &s;ee what Injury it would do any Clergy|man to have it in his Eye, and believe, all that are taken from him by his Want of Indu&s;try, are to be demanded of him. I dare &s;ay, <HI>Favonius</HI> has very few of the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es. <HI>Favonius,</HI> in the mid&s;t of a Thou&s;and impertinent A&s;&s;ailants of the Divine Truths, is an undi&s;turbed Defender of'em. He protects all under his Care, by the Clearne&s;s of his Under&s;tanding, and the Exam|ple of his Life: He vi&s;its dying Men with the
<PB N="150" REF="156">
Air of a Man who hoped for his own Di&s;&s;olution, and enforces in others a Contempt of this Life, by his own Expectation of the next. His Voice and Behaviour are the lively Images of a compo&s;ed and well-governed Zeal. None can leave him for the frivolous Jargon uttered by the ordinary Teachers among Di&s;&s;enters, but &s;uch who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h Vociferation from Eloquence, and Argument from Railing. He is &s;o great a Judge of Mankind, and touches our Pa&s;&s;ions with &s;o &s;u|perior a Command, that he who de&s;erts his Con|gregation mu&s;t be a Stranger to the Dictates of Nature, as well as to tho&s;e of Grace.</P>

<Q><L>Paulum &s;epulte di&s;tat Inertiae</L>
<L>Celata Virtus.</L></Q>
<Q>Hidden Vice, and conceal'd Virtue, are much alike.</Q>
<P>Be plea&s;ed therefore to let the following Me|moirs have a Place in their Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In a certain Part of the Town, famous for the fre&s;he&s;t Oy&s;ters and the plaine&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> there is a Hou&s;e, or rather a College, &s;acred to Ho&s;pitality, and the indu&s;trious Arts. At the Entrance is hieroglyphically drawn, a Cavali r contending with a Mon&s;ter, with Jaws expand|ed, ju&s;t ready to devour him.</P>
<P>Hither the Brethren of the Indu&s;try re&s;ort; but to avoid O&s;tentation, they wear no Habits of Di&s;tinction, and perform their Exerci&s;es with as little Noi&s;e and Show as po&s;&s;ible. Here are no Under-Graduates, but each is a Ma&s;ter of his Art. They are di&s;tributed according to their various Talents, and detached abroad in
<PB N="154" REF="160">
Parties, to divide the Labours of the Day. They have Dogs as well nos'd and as fleet as any, and no Sport&s;men &s;hew greater Activity. Some beat for the Game, &s;ome hunt it, others come in at the Death; and my hone&s;t Landlord makes very good Veni&s;on Sauce, and eats his Share of the Dinner.</P>
<P>I would fain pur&s;ue my Metaphors; but a ve|nerable Per&s;on who &s;tands by me, and waits to bring you this Letter, and whom, by a certain Benevolence in his Look, I &s;u&s;pect to be <HI>Pacolet,</HI> reproves me, and obliges me to write in plainer Terms, That the Society had fixed their Eyes on a gay young Gentleman, who has lately &s;uc|ceeded to a Title and an E&s;tate; the latter of which they judged would be very convenient for them. Therefore, after &s;everal Attempts to get into his Acquaintance, my Landlord finds an Opportunity to make his Court to a Friend of the young Spark's, in the following Manner:</P>
<P>Sir, As I take you to be a Lover of Ingenuity and Plain-Dealing, I &s;hall &s;peak very freely to you. In a few Words then, you are acquainted with Sir <HI>Liberal Brisk.</HI> Providence has for our Emolument &s;ent him a fair E&s;tate, for Men are not born for them&s;elves. Therefore if you'll bring him to my Hou&s;e, we will <HI>take Care of him,</HI> and you &s;hall have half the Profits. There's <HI>Ace</HI> and <HI>Cutter</HI> will do his Bu&s;ine&s;s to a Hair. You'll tell me, perhaps, he's your Friend: I grant it, and 'tis for that I propo&s;e it, to prevent his falling into ill Hands.</P>
<Q><L>We'll carve him like a Di&s;h fit for the Gods,</L>
<L>Not hew him like a Carca&s;s fit for Hounds.</L></Q>
<P>In &s;hort, there are to my certain Knowledge a Hundred Mouths open for him. Now if we can &s;ecure him to our &s;elves, we &s;hall di&s;ap|point all tho&s;e Ra&s;cals that don't de&s;erve him.
<PB N="155" REF="161">
Nay, you need not &s;tare at it, Sir, 'tis for your own Advantage. Be&s;ides, <HI>Partridge</HI> has ca&s;t me his Nativity, and I find by certain De&s;tiny, <HI>his Oaks mu&s;t be fell'd.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman to whom this hone&s;t Propo|&s;al was made, made little An&s;wer; but &s;aid he would con&s;ider of it, and immediately took Coach to find out the young Baronet, and told him all that had pa&s;s'd, together with the new Salvo to &s;atisfie a Man's Con&s;cience in &s;acrifi|cing his Friend. Sir <HI>Brisk</HI> was fired, &s;wore a Dozen Oaths, drew his Sword, put it up again, call'd for his Man, beat him, and bid him fetch a Coach. His Friend asked him, What he de|&s;ign'd, and whither he was going? He an&s;wer|ed, to find out the Villains and fight 'em. To which his Friend agreed, and promi&s;ed to be his Second, on Condition he would fir&s;t divide his E&s;tate to 'em, and re&s;erve only a Proportion to him&s;elf, that &s;o he might have the Ju&s;tice of fighting his Equals. His next Re&s;olution was to play with 'em, and let 'em &s;ee he was not the Bubble they took him for.

<P>This is certainly the mo&s;t plain Dealing that ever was u&s;ed, except that the ju&s;t Quantity which an Elector may drink without Exce&s;s, and the Difference between an Acknowledgment and a Bribe, wants Explanation. Another Difficulty with me is, How a Man who is bargain'd with for a Chaldron of Coals for his Vote, &s;hall be &s;aid to have that Chaldron <HI>gratis?</HI> If my Kin&s;|man <HI>Greenhat</HI> had given me the lea&s;t Intimation of his De&s;ign, I &s;hould have prevented his pub|li&s;hing Non&s;ence; nor &s;hould any Knight in <HI>Eng|land</HI> have put my Relation at the Bottom of the Leaf as a Po&s;t&s;cript, when after all it appears <HI>Greenhat</HI> has been the more popular Man. There is here &s;uch open Contradiction, and clum&s;y Art to palliate the Matter, and prove to the People, that the Freedom of Election is &s;afer when laid out in Coals than &s;trong Drink, that I can turn this only to a Religious U&s;e, and admire the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of Things; for if the&s;e Fellows were as wi&s;e as they are rich, Where would be our Liber|ty?

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> if the making a Man guilty of Vices that would &s;hame the Gallows, be the be&s;t Methods to <HI>point at the true Object of Raillery,</HI> I have till this Time been very igno ant; but if it be &s;o, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert one Thing, and lay it down as a Maxim, even to the <HI>Staffian</HI> Race, <HI>viz.</HI> That that Method of Pointing ought no more to be pur&s;ued, than tho&s;e People ought to cut your Throat who &s;uffer by it, becau&s;e I take both to be Murder, and the Law is not in every pri|vate Man's Hands to execute: But indeed, Sir, were you the only Per&s;on would &s;uffer by the <HI>Tatler</HI>'s Di&s;continuance, I have Malice enough to puni&s;h you in the Manner you pre&s;cribe; but I am not &s;o great an Enemy to the Town or my own Plea&s;ures, as to wi&s;h it; nor that you would lay a&s;ide la&s;hing the reigning Vices, &s;o long as you keep to the true Spirit of Satyr, without de&s;cending to rake into Characters be|low its Dignity; for as you well ob&s;erve, <HI>There is &s;omething very terrible in unju&s;tly attacking Men in a Way that may prejudice their Honour or Fortune;</HI> and indeed, where Crimes are enor|mous, the Delinquent de&s;erves little Pity, yet the Reporter may de&s;erve le&s;s: And here I am naturally led to that celebrated Author of <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> who hath &s;et this Matter in a true Light in his Treati&s;e of <HI>the Govern|ment of the Tongue;</HI> where, &s;peaking of un|charitable Truths, he &s;ays, a Di&s;covery of this
<PB N="161" REF="167">
Kind <HI>&s;erves not to reclaim, but enrage the Offen|der, and precipitate him into farther Degrees of Ill. Mode&s;ty and Fear of Shame is one of tho&s;e natural Re&s;traints, which the Wi&s;dom of Heaven has put upon Mankind; and he that once &s;tum|bles, may yet by a Check of that Bridle recover again: But when by a publick Detection he is fallen under that Infamy he feared, he will then be apt to di&s;card all Caution, and to think he ower him&s;elf the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ures of Vice, as the Price of his Reputation. Nay, perhaps he advances farther, and &s;ets up for a revers'd Sort of Fame, by being eminently wicked, and he who before was but a clande&s;tine Di&s;ciple, becomes a Doctor of</HI> Impiety, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Sort of Rea&s;oning, Sir, mo&s;t certainly induced our wi&s;e Legi&s;lators ve|ry lately to repeal that Law which put the Stamp of Infamy in the Face of Felons; there|fore you had better give an Act of Oblivion to your Delinquents, at lea&s;t for Tran&s;portation, than continue to mark them in &s;o notorious a Manner. I can't but applaud your de&s;ign'd At|tempt of <HI>rai&s;ing Merit from Ob&s;curity, cele|brating Virtue in Di&s;tre&s;s, and attacking Vice in another Method, by &s;etting Innocence in a proper Light.</HI> Your pur&s;uing the&s;e noble Themes, will make a greater Advance to the Reforma|tion you &s;eem to aim at, than the Method you have hitherto taken, by putting Mankind be|yond the Power of retrieving them&s;elves, or indeed to think it po&s;&s;ible. But if after all your Endeavours in this new Way, there &s;hould then remain any harden'd Impenitents, you mu&s;t e'en give 'em up to the Rigour of the Law, as Delinquents not within the Benefit of their Clergy. Pardon me, good Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> for the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of this Epi&s;tle, and believe 'tis not from any Self-Conviction I have taken up &s;o much of your Time, or my own; but &s;uppo&s;ing you mean all your Lu|cubrations

<P>This Evening I thought fit to notifie to the <HI>Li|terati</HI> of this Hou&s;e, and by that Means to all the World, That on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 15th of <HI>October</HI> next en&s;uing, I de&s;ign to fix my fir&s;t Table of <HI>Fame;</HI> and de&s;ire that &s;uch as are acquainted with the Characters of the Twelve mo&s;t famous Men that have ever appeared in the World, would &s;eud in their Li&s;ts, or name any one Man for that Table, a&s;&s;igning al&s;o his Place at it be|fore that Time, upon Pain of having &s;uch his Man of Fame po&s;tponed, or placed too high for ever. I &s;hall not, upon any Application what&s;o|ever, alter the Place which upon that Day I &s;hall give to any of the&s;e Worthies. But where|as there are many who take upon them to ad|mire this Hero, or that Author, upon Second|hand, I expect each Sub&s;criber &s;hould under|write his Rea&s;on for the Place he allots his Can|didate.</P>
<P>The Thing is of the la&s;t Con&s;equence; for we are about &s;ettling the greate&s;t Point that has ever been debated in any Age, and I &s;hall take Pre|cautions accordingly. Let every Man who votes con&s;ider, That he is now going to give away that, for which the Soldier gave up his Re&s;t, his Plea&s;ure, and his Life; the Scholar re&s;ign'd his whole Series of Thought, his Midnight Repo&s;e, and his Morning Slumbers. In a Word, he is (as I may &s;ay) to be Judge of that After-Life, which noble Spirits prefer to their very real Be|ings. I hope I &s;hall be forgiven therefore, if I make &s;ome Objections again&s;t their Jury, as they &s;hall occur to me. The Whole of the Number
<PB N="163" REF="169">
by whom they are to be try'd, are to be Scholars. I am per&s;waded al&s;o, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> will be put up by all of that Cla&s;s of Men. However, in Behalf of others, &s;uch as wear the Livery of <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI> the Two famous Univer&s;ities are called up|on on this Occa&s;ion; but I except the Men of <HI>Queen's, Exeter,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> Colleges, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> who are not to be Electors, becau&s;e he &s;hall not be crown'd from an implicit Faith in his Wri|tings, but receive his Honour from &s;uch Judges as &s;hall allow him to be cen&s;ur'd. Upon this Election (as I was ju&s;t now going to &s;ay) I bani&s;h all who think and &s;peak after others to concern them&s;elves in it. For which Rea&s;on all illiterate di&s;tant Admirers are forbidden to corrupt the Voices, by &s;ending, according to the new Mode, any poor Students Coals and Candles for their Votes in Behalf of &s;uch Worthies as they pretend to e&s;teem. All News-Writers are al&s;o excluded, becau&s;e they con&s;ider Fame as it is a Report which gives Foundation to the filling up their Rhap&s;odies, and not as it is the Emanation or Con&s;equence of good and evil Actions. The&s;e are excepted again&s;t as ju&s;tly as Butchers in ca&s;e of Life and Death: Their Familiarity with the greate&s;t Names takes off the Delicacy of their Regard, as dealing in Blood makes the <HI>Lanii</HI> le&s;s tender of &s;pilling it.</P>

<P>I Am called off from publick Di&s;&s;ertations by a Dome&s;tick Affair of great Importance, which is no le&s;s than the Di&s;po&s;al of my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI> for Life. The Girl is a Girl of great Merit, and plea&s;ing Conver&s;ation; but I being born of my Father's Fir&s;t Wife, and &s;he of his Third, &s;he conver&s;es with me rather like a Daughter than a Si&s;ter. I have indeed told her, That if &s;he kept her Honour, and behaved her &s;elf in &s;uch Man|ner as became the <HI>Bicker&s;taffs,</HI> I would get her an agreeable Man for her Husband; which was a Promi&s;e I made her after reading a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles.</HI> That polite Author had been employ'd to find out a Con&s;ort for his Friend's Daughter, and gives the following Character of the Man he had pitch'd upon:</P>
<Q>Aciliano plurlmum Vigoris &amp; Indu&s;triae quan|quam in maxima Verecundia: E&s;t illi Facies libe|ralis, multo Sanguine, multo Rubore, &s;uffu&s;a: E&s;t ingenua totius Corporis Pulchritudo, &amp; quidam fe|natorius
<PB N="165" REF="171">
Decor, quae ego nequaquam arbitror negli|genda: Debet enim hoc Ca&s;titati Puellarum qua&s;i Praemium dari.</Q>
<Q><HI>Acilianus</HI> (for that was the Gentleman's Name) is a Man of extraordinary Vigour and Indu&s;try, accompanied with the greate&s;t Mode&s;ty. He has very much of the Gentleman, with a lively Colour, and Flu&s;h of Health in his A&s;pect. His whole Per&s;on is finely turn'd, and &s;peaks him a Man of Quality: Which are Qualifications that, I think, ought by no Means to be over-look'd, and &s;hould be be&s;tow'd on a Daughter as the Reward of her Cha&s;tity.</Q>
<P>A Woman that will give her &s;elf Liberties, need not put her Parents to &s;o much Trouble; for if &s;he does not po&s;&s;es the&s;e Ornaments in a Hu&s;|band, &s;he can &s;upply her &s;elf el&s;ewhere. But this is not the Ca&s;e of my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny,</HI> who, I may &s;ay without Vanity, is as un&s;potted a Spin&s;ter as any in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I &s;hall take this Occa&s;ion to recommend the Conduct of our own Family in this Particular.</P>
<P>We have in the Genealogy of our Hou&s;e, the De&s;criptions and Pictures of our Ance&s;tors from the Time of King <HI>Arthur;</HI> in who&s;e Days there was one of my own Name, a Knight of his Round Table, and known by the Name of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff.</HI> He was low of Stature, and of a very &s;warthy Complexion, not unlike a <HI>Por|tugueze</HI> Jew. But he was more prudent than Men of that Height u&s;ually are, and would often communicate to his Friends his De&s;ign of leng|thening and whitening his Po&s;terity. His elde&s;t Son <HI>Ralph,</HI> for that was his Name, was for this Rea&s;on married to a Lady who had little el&s;e to recommend her, but that &s;he was very tall and very fair. The I&s;&s;ue of this Match, with the Help of high Shoes, made a tolerable Figure in the next Age; though the Complexion of the
<PB N="166" REF="172">
Family was ob&s;cure 'till the Fourth Generation from that Marriage. From which Time, till the Reign of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> the Females of our Hou&s;e were famous for their Needle-work and fine Skins. In the Male Line, there happen|ed an unlucky Accident in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third; the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Philip,</HI> then Chief of the Family, being born with an Hump-back and very high No&s;e. This was the more a&s;toni&s;h|ing, becau&s;e none of his Forefathers ever had &s;uch a Blemi&s;h; nor indeed was there any in the Neighbourhood of that Make, except the But|ler, who was noted for round Shoulders, and a <HI>Roman</HI> No&s;e: What made the No&s;e the le&s;s excu&s;able, was the remarkable Smallne&s;s of his Eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal Defects were mended by &s;ucceed|ing Matches; the Eyes were open'd in the next Generation, and the Hump fell in a Century and half; but the greate&s;t Difficulty was, how to re|duce the No&s;e; which I do not find was accom|pli&s;h'd till about the Middle of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, or rather the Beginning of that of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth.</P>
<P>But while our Ance&s;tors were thus taken up in cultivating the Eyes and No&s;e, the Face of the <HI>Bicker&s;taffs</HI> fell down in&s;en&s;ibly into Chin; which was not taken Notice of (their Thoughts being &s;o much employ'd upon the more noble Fea|tures) till it became almo&s;t too long to be reme|died.</P>
<P>But Length of Time, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Care in our Alliances, have cured this al&s;o, and reduced our Faces into that tolerable Oval which we en|joy at pre&s;ent. I would not be tedious in this Di&s;cour&s;e, but cannot but ob&s;erve, that our Race &s;uffer'd very much about Three Hundred Years ago, by the Marriage of one of our Heire&s;&s;es with an eminent Courtier, who gave us Spindle-Shanks, and Cramps in our Bones, in&s;omuch that we
<PB N="167" REF="173">
did not recover our Health and Legs till Sir <HI>Wal|ter Bicker&s;taff</HI> married <HI>Maud</HI> the Milk-Maid, of whom the then <HI>Garter</HI> King at Arms (a facetious Per&s;on) &s;aid plea&s;antly enough, That &s;he had &s;poil|ed our Blood, but mended our Con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>After this Account of the Effect our prudent Choice of Matches has had upon our Per&s;ons and Features, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that there are daily In&s;tances of as great Changes made by Mar|riage upon Men's Minds and Humours. One might wear any Pa&s;&s;ion out of a Family by Cul|ture, as skilful Gardiners blot a Colour out of a Tulip that hurts its Beauty. One might produce an affable Temper out of a Shrew, by grafting the Mild upon the Cholerick; or rai&s;e a Jack|pudding from a Prude, by inoculating Mirth and Melancholy. It is for Want of Care in the di&s;po|&s;ing of our Children, with Regard to our Bodies and Minds, that we go into an Hou&s;e and &s;ee &s;uch different Complexions and Humours in the &s;ame Race and Family. But to me it is as plain as a Pike&s;taff, from what Mixture it is, that this Daughter &s;ilently lowers, t'other &s;teals a kind Look at you, a third is exactly well behaved, a fourth a Splenatick, and a fifth a Coquet.</P>
<P>In this Di&s;po&s;al of my Si&s;ter, I have cho&s;en, with an Eye to her being a Wit, and provided, that the Bridegroom be a Man of &s;ound and excellent Judgment, who will &s;eldom mind what &s;he &s;ays when &s;he begins to harangue: For <HI>Jenny</HI>'s only Imperfection is an Admiration of her Parts, which inclines her to be a little, but a ve|ry little, &s;lutti&s;h; and you are ever to remark, that we are apt to cultivate mo&s;t, and bring into Ob&s;ervation, what we think mo&s;t excellent in our &s;elves, or mo&s;t capable of Improvement. Thus my Si&s;ter, in&s;tead of con&s;ulting her Gla&s;s and her Toilet for an Hour and an half after her private Devotions, &s;its with her No&s;e full of Snuff, and a Man's Nightcap on her Head, read|ing
<PB N="168" REF="174">
in Plays and Romances. Her Wit &s;he thinks het Di&s;tinction; therefore knows nothing of the Skill of Dre&s;s, or making her Per&s;on agreeable. It would make you laugh to &s;ee me often with my Spectacles on, lacing her Stays; for &s;he is &s;o very a Wit, that &s;he under&s;tands no ordinary Thing in the World.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on I have di&s;po&s;ed of her to a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who will &s;oon let her &s;ee, that to be well dre&s;s'd, in good Humour, and chearful in the Command of her Family, are the Arts and Sci|ences of Female Life. I could have be&s;tow'd her upon a Fine Gentleman, who extremely admir'd her Wit, and would have given her a Coach and Six: But I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s the Strain; for had they met, they had eternally been Rivals in Di&s;cour&s;e, and in continual Contention for the Superiority of Under&s;tanding, and brought forth Criticks, Pedants, or pretty good Poets. As it is, I expect an Offspring fit for the Habitation of City, Town, or Country; Creatures that are docile and tractable in whatever we put 'em to.</P>
<P>To convince Men of the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking this Method, let any one, even below the Skill of an A&s;trologer, behold the Turn of Faces he meets as &s;oon as he pa&s;&s;es <HI>Cheap&s;ide-Conduit,</HI> and you &s;ee a deep Attention and a certain unthinking Sharpne&s;s in every Countenance. They look at|tentive, but their Thoughts are engaged on mean Purpo&s;es. To me it is very apparent when I &s;ee a Citizen pa&s;s by, whether his Head is upon Woollen, Silks, Iron, Sugar, Indigo, or Stocks. Now, this Trace of Thought appears or lies hid in the Race for Two or Three Generations.</P>
<P>I know at this Time a Per&s;on of a va&s;t E&s;tate, who is the immediate De&s;cendant of a Fine Gen|tleman, but the Great-Grand&s;on of a Broker, in whom his Ance&s;tor is now revived. He is a very hone&s;t Gentleman in his Principles, but can't for his Blood talk fairly: He is heartily &s;orry for it;
<PB N="169" REF="175">
but he cheats by Con&s;titution, and over-reaches by In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The Happine&s;s of the Man who Marries my Si&s;ter will be, that he has no Faults to correct in her but her own, a little Bya&s;s of Fancy, or Par|ticularity of Manners, which grew in her &s;elf, and can be amended by her. From &s;uch an un|tainted Couple, we can hope to have our Family ri&s;e to its ancient Splendor of Face, Air, Counte|nance, Manner and Shape, without di&s;covering the Product of Ten Nations in one Hou&s;e. <HI>Oba|diah Greenhat</HI> &s;ays, he never comes into any Company in <HI>England,</HI> but he di&s;tingui&s;hes the different Nations of which we are compos'd: There is &s;carce &s;uch a living Creature as a True <HI>Britain.</HI> We &s;it down indeed all Friends, Ac|quaintance, and Neighbours; but after Two Bot|tles, you &s;ee a <HI>Dane</HI> &s;tart up and &s;wear, The Kingdom is his own. A <HI>Saxon</HI> drinks up the whole Quart, and &s;wears, He'll di&s;pute that with him. A <HI>Norman</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ells 'em both, He'll a&s;&s;ert his Liberty: And a <HI>Wel&s;hman</HI> cries, They are all Fo|reigners and Intruders of Ye&s;terday, and beats 'em out of the Room. Such Accidents happen frequently among Neighbours Children, and Cou|&s;in-Germans. For which Rea&s;on I &s;ay, &s;tudy your Race, or the Soil of your Family will dwin|dle into Cits or 'Squires, or run up into Wits or Madmen.</P>

<P>IT is a Thing very much to be lamented, that a Man mu&s;t u&s;e a certain Cunning to caution People again&s;t what it is their Intere&s;t to avoid.

All Men will allow, that it is a great and heroick Work to correct Men's Errors, and at the Price of being called a Common Enemy, to go on in being a Common Friend to my Fellow Subjects and Citizens. But I am forced in this Work to revolve the &s;ame Thing in Ten Thou&s;and Lights, and ca&s;t 'em in as many Forms, to come at Men's Minds and Affections, in order to lead the Inno|cent in Safety, as well as di&s;appoint the Artifices of Betrayers.

<P>The greate&s;t Misfortune Men fall into, ari&s;e from them&s;elves; and that Temper, which is call'd very often, tho' with great Inju&s;tice, Good Nature, is the Source of a numberle&s;s Train of Evils.

It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;uch a one has &s;o great a Benevolence in him, that he bears a Thou&s;and Unea&s;me&s;&s;es, rather than he will incommode others; nay often when he has ju&s;t Rea&s;on to be offended, chu&s;es to &s;it down with a &s;mall Injury, than bring it into Reprehen|&s;ion, out of pure Compa&s;&s;ion to the Offender. Such a Per&s;on has it u&s;ually &s;aid of him, He is no Man's Enemy but his own; which is in Ef|fect &s;aying, He is a Friend to every Man but him&s;elf and his Friends: For by a natural Con&s;e|quence of his neglecting him&s;elf, he either inca|pacitates
<PB N="171" REF="177">
him&s;elf to be another's Friend, or makes others cea&s;e to be his. If I take no Care of my own Affairs, no Man that is my Friend, can take it ill if I am negligent al&s;o of his. This &s;oft Di&s;|po&s;ition, if it continues uncorrected, throws Men into a Sea of Difficulties.</P>

His Diet is Butchers Meat, his Wenches are in plain Pinners and <HI>Norwich</HI> Crapes, his Dre&s;s like other People, his Income great, and yet has he &s;el|dom a Guinea at Command.

<P>I &s;hall not promote &s;uch De&s;igns, but &s;hall leave her to find out her Admirer, while I &s;peak to ano|ther Ca&s;e &s;ent to me by a Letter of <HI>September</HI> 30. &s;ub&s;crib'd, <HI>Lovewell Barebones,</HI> where the Author de&s;ires me to &s;u&s;pend my Care of the Dead, till I have done &s;omething for the Dying. His Ca&s;e is, That the Lady he loves is ever accompanied by a Kin&s;woman, one of tho&s;e gay cunning Women, who prevent all the Love which is not addre&s;s'd to them&s;elves. This Creature takes upon her in his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Pre&s;ence to ask him, Whether Mrs. <HI>Flo|rimel</HI> (that is the cruel One's Name) is not very hand&s;ome; upon which he looks &s;illy; then they both laugh our, and &s;he will tell him, That Mrs. <HI>Florimel</HI> had an equal Pa&s;&s;ion for him, but defined him not to expect the fir&s;t Time to be ad|mitted in private; but that now he was at Li|berty before her only, who was her Friend, to &s;peak his Mind, and that his Mi&s;tre&s;s expected it. Upon which <HI>Florimel</HI> acts a Virgin-Confu&s;ion, and with &s;ome Di&s;order waits his Speech. Here ever follows a deep Silence; after which a loud Laugh. Mr. <HI>Barebones</HI> applies him&s;elf to me on this Occa&s;ion. All the Advice I can give him is to find a Lover for the Confident, for there is no other Bribe will prevail; and I &s;ee by her Carri|age, that it is no hard Matter, for &s;he is too gay to have a particular Pa&s;&s;ion, or to want a general One.</P>
<P>Some Days ago the Town had a full Charge laid again&s;t my E&s;&s;ays, and printed at large.

<P>AS I always looked upon Satyr as the be&s;t Friend to Reformation, whil&s;t its La&s;hes were gene|ral; &s;o that Gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tatler,</HI> N^o. 74. Sept. 29.</NOTE> mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I do not &s;ee the Inconvenience of a Method he is &s;o much concerned at. The Errors he a&s;&s;igns in it, I think, are compri&s;ed <HI>in the De&s;peration Men are generally driven too, when by a publick Detection they fall under the Infamy they feared, who otherwi&s;e, by checking their Bridle, might have recovered their Stumble, and through a Self-Conviction become their own Reformers: So he that was before but a clande&s;tine Di&s;ciple,</HI> (to u&s;e his own Quotation) <HI>is now become a Doctor in Impiety.</HI> The little Suc|ce&s;s that is to be expected by the&s;e Methods from a harden'd Offender, is too evident to in&s;i&s;t on; yet it is true there is a great deal of Charity in this Sort of Rea&s;oning, whil&s;t the Effects of tho&s;e Crimes extend not beyond them&s;elves. But what Relation has this to your Proceedings? It is not a circum&s;tantial Gue&s;&s;ing will &s;erve turn, for there are more than one to pretend to any of your Characters; but there mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;omething that mu&s;t amount to a nominal De&s;cription, before even common Fame can &s;eparate me from the re&s;t of Mankind to dart at. A general Repre&s;entation of an Action, either ridiculous or enormous, may make tho&s;e winch which find too much Similitude in the Character with them&s;elves to plead Not Guilty; but none but a Witne&s;s to the Crime can charge them with the Guilt, whil&s;t the Indictment is general, and the Offender has the A&s;ylum of the whole World to protect him. Here can then be no Inju&s;tice, where no one is injured; for it is them&s;elves must appropriate the Saddle, be|fore Scandal can ride them.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">Your Method then, in my Opinion, is no Way &s;ubject to the Charge brought again&s;t it; but on the contra|ry, I believe this Advantage is too often drawn from it, that whil&s;t we laugh at, or dete&s;t, the uncer|tain Subject of the Satyr, we often find &s;omething in the Error a Parallel to our &s;elves; and being in&s;en&s;i|bly drawn to the Compari&s;on we would get rid of, we plunge deeper into the Mire, and Shame produces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">at which Advice has been too weak for; and you, Sir, get Converts you never thought of.</P>
<P>As for de&s;cending to Characters below the Digni|ty of Satyr, what Men think are not beneath Com|mi&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure him, I think are not beneath Reproof: For as there is as much Folly in a ridiculous Deportment, as there is Enormity in a Criminal one, &s;o neither the one nor the other ought to plead Ex|emption. The Kennel of Curs are as much Enemies to the State, as <HI>Greg</HI> for his Confederacy; for as this betray'd our Government, &s;o the other does our Proper|ty, and one without the other is equally u&s;ele&s;s. As for the Act of Oblivion he &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ts on, <HI>Le Roy s'avi&s;era</HI> is a fa&s;hionable An&s;wer; and for his Modus of Panegyrick, the Hint was unnece&s;&s;ary, where Virtue need never ask twice for her Lawrel. But as for his Reformation by Oppo&s;ites, I again mu&s;t ask his Pardon, if I think the Effects of the&s;e Sort of Rea&s;onings (by the Paucity of Converts) are too great an Argument, both of their Imbecility and Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s, to believe it will be any better than mi&s;pending of Time, by &s;u&s;pending a Method that will turn more to Advantage, and which has no other Danger of lo&s;ing Ground, but by Di&s;continu|ance. And as I am certain (of what he &s;uppo&s;es) that your Lucubrations are intended for the publick Benefit, &s;o I hope you will not give them &s;o great an Interruption, by laying a&s;ide the only Method that can render you beneficial to Mankind, and (a|mong others) agreeable to,</P>

<P>AS bad as the World is, I find by very &s;trict Ob&s;ervation upon Virtue and Vice, that if Men appeared no wor&s;e than they really are, I &s;hould have le&s;s Work than at pre&s;ent I am obli|ged to undertake for their Reformation. They have generally taken up a kind of inverted Am|bition, and affect even Faults and Imperfections of which they are innocent. The other Day in a Coffee-hou&s;e I &s;tood by a young Heir, with a fre&s;h, &s;anguine, and healthy Look, who enter|tained us with an Account of his Claps and his Diet-Drink; though, to my Knowledge, he is as &s;ound as any of his Tenants.</P>
<P>This worthy Youth put me into Reflections up|on that Subject; and I ob&s;erved the fanta&s;tical Humour to be &s;o general, that there is hardly a Man who is not more or le&s;s tainted with it. The Fir&s;t of this Order of Men are the <HI>Valetudinarians,</HI> who are never in Health, but complain of Want of Stomach or Re&s;t every Day till Noon, and then de|vour all which comes before them. Lady <HI>Dainty</HI> is convinced, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for a Gentlewoman to be out of Order; and to pre&s;erve that Chara|cter, &s;he dines every Day in her Clo&s;et at Twelve, that &s;he may become her Table at Two, and be unable to eat in Publick. About five Years ago, I remember it was the Fa&s;hion to be &s;hort-&s;ighted: A Man would not own an Acquaintance 'till he had fir&s;t examined him with his Gla&s;s. At a Lady's Entrance into the Play-hou&s;e, you might &s;ee Tubes immediately levelled at her from every
<PB N="177" REF="183">
Quarter of the Pit and Side-Boxes. However, that Mode of Infirmity is out, and the Age has recovered its Sight: But the Blind &s;eem to be &s;ucceeded by the Lame, and a janty Limp is the pre&s;ent Beauty. I think I have formerly ob&s;er|ved, a Cane is Part of the Dre&s;s of a Prig, and always worn upon a Button, for fear he &s;hould be thought to have an Occa&s;ion for it, or be e|&s;teemed really, and not genteely a Cripple. I have con&s;idered, but could never find out the Bottom of this Vanity. I indeed have heard of a <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> General, who by the lucky grazing of a Bullet on the Roll of his Stocking, took Occa&s;ion to halt all his Life after. But as for our peacea|ble Cripples, I know no Foundation for their Behaviour, without it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that in this Warlike Age, &s;ome think a Cane the next Honour to a Wooden Leg. This Sort of Affecta|tion I have known run from one Limb or Mem|ber to another. Before the <HI>Limpers</HI> came in, I remember a Race of <HI>Li&s;pers,</HI> fine Per&s;ons, who took an Aver&s;ion to particular Letters in our Lan|guage: Some never uttered the Letter <HI>H;</HI> and o|thers had as mortal an Aver&s;ion to <HI>S.</HI> Others have had their fa&s;hionable Defect in their Ears, and would make you repeat all you &s;aid twice over. I know an ancient Friend of mine, who&s;e Table is every Day &s;urrounded with Flatterers, that makes u&s;e of this, &s;ometimes as a Piece of Grandeur, and at others as an Art, to make them repeat their Commendations. Such Affectations have been indeed in the World in ancient Times; but they fell into them out of politick Ends. <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> had a wry Neck, which made it the Fa&s;hion in his Court to carry their Heads on one Side when they came into the Pre|&s;ence. One who thought to out&s;hine the whole Court, carried his Head &s;o over-complai&s;antly, that this martial Prince gave him &s;o great a Box
<PB N="178" REF="184">
on the Ear, as &s;et all the Heads of the Court up|right.</P>
<P>This Humour takes Place in our Minds as well as Bodies. I know at this Time a young Gentle|man, who talks athei&s;tically all Day in Coffee-hou&s;es, and in his Degrees of Under&s;tanding &s;ets up for a <HI>Free Thinker;</HI> though it can be proved upon him, he &s;ays his Prayers every Morning and Evening. But this Cla&s;s of modern Wits I &s;hall re&s;erve for a Chapter by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Of the like Turn are all your <HI>Marriage-Haters,</HI> who rail at the Noo&s;e, at the Words, <HI>For ever and Aye,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time are &s;ecretly pining for &s;ome young Thing or other that makes their Hearts ake by her Refu&s;al. The next to the&s;e, are &s;uch as pretend to govern their Wives, and boa&s;t how ill they u&s;e them; when at the &s;ame Time, go to their Hou&s;es, and you &s;hall &s;ee them &s;tep as if they feared making a Noi&s;e, and are as fond as an Alderman. I don't know, but &s;ometimes the&s;e Pretences may ari&s;e from a De&s;ire to conceal a contrary Defect than that they &s;et up for. I re|member, when I was a young Fellow, we had a Companion of a very fearful Complexion, who, when we &s;ate in to drink, would de&s;ire us to take his Sword from him when he grew fuddled, for 'twas his Misfortune to be quarrel&s;ome.</P>
<P>There are many, many of the&s;e Evils, which demand my Ob&s;ervation; but becau&s;e I have of late been thought &s;omewhat too Satyrical, I &s;hall give them Warning, and declare to the whole World, that they are not true, but fal&s;e Hypo|crites; and make it out, that they are good Men in their Hearts. The Motive of this mon&s;trous Affectation in the above-mentioned, and the like Particulars, I take to proceed from that noble Thir&s;t of Fame and Reputation which is planted in the Hearts of all Men. As this produces ele|gant Writings and gallant Actions in Men of great Abilities, it al&s;o brings forth &s;purious Pro|ductions
<PB N="179" REF="185">
in Men who are not capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing them&s;elves by Things which are really Prai&s;e-worthy. As the De&s;ire of Fame in Men of true Wit and Gallantry &s;hows it &s;elf in pro|per In&s;tances, the &s;ame De&s;ire in Men who have the Ambition without proper Faculties, runs wild, and di&s;covers it &s;elf in a Thou&s;and Extra|vagancies, by which they would &s;ignalize them|&s;elves from other, and gain a Set of Admirers. When I was a middle-aged Man, there were ma|ny Societies of ambitious young Men in <HI>England,</HI> who, in their Pur&s;uits after Fame, were every Night employed in roa&s;ting Porters, &s;moaking Coblers, Knocking down Watchmen, overturn|ing Con&s;tables, breaking Windows, blackening Sign-Po&s;ts, in the like immortal Enterprizes, that di&s;per&s;ed their Reputation throughout the whole Kingdom. One could hardly find a Knocker at a Door in a whole Street after a Midnight Expedition of the&s;e <HI>Beaux E&s;prits.</HI> I was lately very much &s;urpri&s;ed by an Account of my Maid, who entered my Bed-Chamber this Morn|ing in a very great Fright, and told me, She was afraid my Palour was haunted; for that &s;he had found &s;everal Panes of my Windows broken, and the Floor &s;trowed with Half-pence. I have not yet a full Light into this new Way, but am apt to think, that it is a generous Piece of Wit that &s;ome of my Contemporaries make U&s;e of, to break Windows, and leave Money to pay for them.</P>

I think the Writer of this Letter has put the Matter in as good a Dre&s;s as I can for him; yet I cannot but add my Applau&s;e to what this di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Man has &s;aid. There is not a more u&s;eful Man in a Commonwealth than a good Phy&s;ician; and by Con&s;equence no worthier a Per&s;on than he that u&s;es his Skill with Genero&s;ity; even to Per&s;ons of Condition, and Compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who are in Want: Which is the Behaviour of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who &s;hows as much Liberality in his Practice, as he does Wit in his Conver&s;ation and Skill in his Profe&s;&s;ion.

It is &s;omething mon&s;trous, to con&s;ider a Man of a liberal Education tearing out the Bowels of a poor Family, by taking for a Vi&s;it what would keep them a Week. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> needs not the Compari&s;on of &s;uch Extortion to &s;et off his Genero&s;ity; but I mention his Genero|&s;ity to add Shame to &s;uch Extortion.</P>

<P>MY Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Lover, the hone&s;t <HI>Tranquil|lus,</HI> (for that &s;hall be his Name) has been impatient with me to di&s;patch the nece&s;&s;ary Di|rections for his Marriage; that while I am taken up with imaginary Schemes (as he called them) he might not burn with real De&s;ire, and the Tor|ture of Expectation. When I had reprimanded him for the Ardor wherein he expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, which I thought had not enough of that Ve|neration
<PB N="187" REF="193">
with which the Marriage-Bed is to be a&s;cended, I told him, the Day of his Nuptials &s;hould be on the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, which was the 8th In&s;tant. On the 7th in the Evening, poor <HI>Jenny</HI> came into my Chamber, and having her Heart full of the great Change of Life from a Virgin Condition to that of a Wife, &s;he long &s;ate &s;ilent. I &s;aw &s;he expected me to entertain her on this important Subject, which was too delicate a Circum&s;tance for her &s;elf to touch upon; whereupon I relieved her Mode&s;ty in the follow|ing Manner: Si&s;ter, (&s;aid I) you are now going from me; and be contented, that you leave the Company of a talkative old Man, for that of a &s;ober young One: But take this along with you, That there is no Mean in the State you are en|tring into, but you are to be exqui&s;itely happy or mi&s;erable, and your Fortune in this Way of Life will be wholly of your own making. In all the Marriages I have ever &s;een, (mo&s;t of which have been unhappy Ones) the great Cau&s;e of Evil has proceeded from &s;light Occa&s;ions; and I take it to be the fir&s;t Maxim in a married Condition, That you are to be above Trifles. When Two Per&s;ons have &s;o good an Opinion of each other as to come together for Life, they will not differ in Matters of Importance, becau&s;e they think of each other with Re&s;pect, in Regard to all Things of Con&s;ideration that may affect them, and are prepared for mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Relief in &s;uch Occurrences; but for le&s;s Occa&s;ions, they have formed no Re&s;olu|tions, but leave their Minds unprepared.</P>
<P>This, dear <HI>Jenny,</HI> is the Rea&s;on that the Quar|rel between Sir <HI>Harry Willit</HI> and his Lady, which began about her Squirrel, is irreconcilable: Sir <HI>Harry</HI> was reading a grave Author; &s;he runs into his Study, and in a playing Humour, claps the Squirrel upon the Folio: He threw the Ani|mal in a Rage on the Floor; &s;he &s;natches it up again, calls Sir <HI>Harry</HI> a &s;owr Pedant, without
<PB N="188" REF="194">
good Nature or good Manners. This ca&s;t him into &s;uch a Rage, that he threw down the Table before him, kick'd the Book round the Room; then recollected him&s;elf: Lord, Ma|dam, &s;aid he, Why did you run into &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions? I was, &s;aid he, in the highe&s;t Delight with that Author when you clap'd your Squirrel upon my Book; and &s;miling, added upon Re|collection, I have a great Re&s;pect for your Fa|vourite, and pray let us all be Friends. My Lady was &s;o far from accepting this Apology, that &s;he immediately conceived a Re&s;olution to keep him under for ever; and with a &s;erious Air, replied, There is no Regard to be had to what a Man &s;ays, who can fall into &s;o indecent a Rage, and &s;uch an abject Submi&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ame Mo|ment, for which I ab&s;olutely de&s;pi&s;e you. Upon which &s;he ru&s;hed out of the Room. Sir <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tayed &s;ome Minutes behind to think and com|mand him&s;elf; after which he followed her into her Bed-chamber, where &s;he was pro&s;trate upon the Bed, tearing her Hair, and naming Twenty Coxcombs who would have u&s;ed her otherwi&s;e. This provoked him to &s;o high a Degree, that he forbore nothing but Beating her; and all the Ser|vants in the Family were at their &s;everal Stations li&s;tening, while the be&s;t Man and Woman, the be&s;t Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, defamed each other in a Way that is not be repeated even at <HI>Billing&s;|gate.</HI> You know this ended in an immediate Se|paration: She longs to return Home, but knows not how to do it: He invites her Home every Day, and lies with every Woman he can get. Her Husband requires no Submi&s;&s;ion of her; but &s;he thinks her very Return will argue &s;he is to blame, which &s;he is re&s;olved to be for ever, rather than acknowledge it.</P>
<P>Thus, dear <HI>Jenny,</HI> my great Advice to you is, Be guarded again&s;t giving or receiving little Pro|vocations. Great Matters of Offence I have no
<PB N="189" REF="195">
Rea&s;on to fear, either from you or your Husband. After this, we turned our Di&s;cour&s;e into a more gay Style, and parted: But before we did &s;o, I made her re&s;ign her Snuff-Box for ever, and half drown her &s;elf with wa&s;hing away the Stench of the Mu&s;ty.</P>
<P>But the Wedding Morning arrived, and our Family being very numerous, there was no a|voiding the Inconvenience of making the Cere|mony and Fe&s;tival more publick, than the mo|dern Way of celebrating them makes me approve of. The Bride next Morning came out of her Chamber, dre&s;&s;ed with all the Art and Care that Mrs. <HI>Toilet</HI> the Tire-Woman could be&s;tow on her. She was on her Wedding-Day Three and twenty: Her Per&s;on is far from what we call a regular Beauty; but a certain Sweetne&s;s in her Countenance, an Ea&s;e in her Shape and Motion, with an unaffected Mode&s;ty in her Looks, had At|tractions beyond what Symmetry and Exactne&s;s can in&s;pire without the Addition of the&s;e Endow|ments. When her Lover entered the Room, her Features flu&s;h'd with Shame and Joy; and the in|genuous Manner, &s;o full of Pa&s;&s;ion and of Awe, with which <HI>Tranquillus</HI> approached to &s;alute her, gave me good Omens of his future Behaviour to|wards her. The Wedding was wholly under my Care. After the Ceremony at Church, I was re&s;ol|ved to entertain the Company with a Dinner &s;uita|ble to the Occa&s;ion, and pitch'd upon the <HI>Apollo,</HI> at the <HI>Old Devil</HI> at <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> as a Place &s;acred to Mirth, temper'd with Di&s;cretion, where <HI>Ben-John|&s;on</HI> and his Sons u&s;ed to make their liberal Meetings. Here the Chief of the <HI>Staffian</HI> Race appeared; and as &s;oon as the Company were come into that am|ple Room, <HI>Lepidus Wag&s;taff</HI> began to make me Compliments for chu&s;ing that Place, and fell in|to a Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Subject of Plea&s;ure and Entertainment, drawn from the Rules of <HI>Ben</HI>'s Club, which are in Gold Letters over the Chim|ney.
<PB N="190" REF="196">
<HI>Lepidus</HI> has a Way very uncommon, and &s;peaks on Subjects, on which any Man el&s;e would certainly offend, with great Dexterity. He gave us a large Account of the publick Meetings of all the well-turned Minds who had pa&s;&s;ed through this Life in Ages pa&s;t, and clo&s;ed his plea&s;ing Narrative with a Di&s;cour&s;e on Marriage, and a Repetition of the following Ver&s;es out of <HI>Milton:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Hail, wedded Love! my&s;terious Law! true Source</L>
<L>Of humane Offspring, &s;ole Propriety</L>
<L>In Paradi&s;e, of all Things common el&s;e.</L>
<L>By thee adult'rous Lu&s;t was driv'n from Men</L>
<L>Among the be&s;tial Herds to range; by thee,</L>
<L>Founded in Rea&s;on, loyal, ju&s;t, and pure,</L>
<L>Relations dear, and all the Charities</L>
<L>Of Father, Son, and Brother, fir&s;t were known.</L>

<L>Pre&s;ent or pa&s;t, as Saints or Patriarchs u&s;ed.</L>
<L>Here Love his Golden Shafts employs; here lights</L>
<L>His con&s;tant Lamp, and waves his Purple Wings:</L>
<L>Reigns here, and revels not in the bought Smile</L>
<L>Of Harlots, lovele&s;s, joyle&s;s, unindear'd,</L>
<L>Ca&s;ual Fruition; nor in Court Amours,</L>
<L>Mixed Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Ball,</L>
<L>Or Serenade, which the &s;tarv'd Lover &s;ings,</L>
<L>To his proud Fair be&s;t quitted with Di&s;dain.</L></Q>
<P>In the&s;e Ver&s;es, all the Images that can come into a young Woman's Head on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, are rai&s;ed; but that in &s;o cha&s;t and elegant a Manner, that the Bride thanked him for his a|greeable Talk, and we &s;ate down to Dinner.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the Company, there was got in a Fellow you call a <HI>Wag.</HI> This ingenious Per|&s;on is the u&s;ual Life of all Fea&s;ts and Merriments, by &s;peaking Ab&s;urdities, and putting every Body of Breeding and Mode&s;ty out of Countenance. As &s;oon as we &s;ate down, he drank to the Bride's
<PB N="191" REF="197">
Diver&s;ion that Night, and then made Twenty double Meanings on the Word <HI>Thing.</HI> We are the be&s;t bred Family, for one &s;o numerous, in this Kingdom; and indeed we &s;hould all of us have been as much out of Countenance as the Bride, but that we were relieved by an hone&s;t rough Relation of ours at the lower End of the Table, who is a Lieutenant of Marines. This Soldier and Sailor had good plain Sen&s;e, and &s;aw what was wrong as well as another; he had a Way of looking at his Plate, and &s;peaking aloud in an inward Manner; and whenever the <HI>Wag</HI> mentioned the Word <HI>Thing,</HI> or the Words, <HI>That &s;ame,</HI> the Lieutenant in that Voice cried, <HI>Knock him down.</HI> The merry Man wondring, angry, and looking round, was the Diver&s;ion of the Table. When he offered to recover, and &s;ay, To the Bride's be&s;t Thoughts, <HI>Knock him down,</HI> &s;ays the Lieutenant, and &s;o on. This &s;illy Hu|mour diverted, and &s;aved us from the ful&s;om Entertainment of an ill-bred Coxcomb, and the Bride drank the Lieutenant's Health. We re|turned to my Lodging, and <HI>Tranquillus</HI> led his Wife to her Apartment, without the Ceremony of throwing the Stocking, which generally co&s;ts Two or Three Maidenheads without any Cere|mony at all.</P>

<P>Soon after the Receipt of this Epi&s;tle, I heard a very gentle Knock at my Door My Maid went down, and brought up Word, That a tall, lean, black Man, well dre&s;&s;ed, who &s;aid he had not the Honour to be acquainted with me, de&s;ired to be admitted. I bid her &s;how him up, met him at my Chamber-Door, and then fell back a few Paces. He approach'd me with great Re&s;pect, and told me with a low Voice, He was the Gen|tleman that had been &s;eated upon the Round Stool. I immediately recollected, that there was a Joint
<PB N="194" REF="200">
Stool in my Chamber, which I was afraid he might take for an In&s;trument of Di&s;tinction, and therefore winked at my Boy to carry it into my Clo&s;et. I then took him by the Hand, and led him to the upper End of my Room, where I placed him in my great Elbow-Chair; at the &s;ame Time drawing another without Arms to it, for my &s;elf to &s;it by him. I then asked him, At what Time this Misfortune befel him? He an&s;wer'd, Between the Hours of Seven and Eight in the Evening. I further demanded of him, What he had eat or drank that Day? He replied, Nothing but a Di&s;h of Water-gruel, with a few Plumbs in it. In the next Place, I felt his Pul&s;e, which was very low and langui&s;hing. The&s;e Circum&s;tances con|firmed me in an Opinion which I had entertained upon the fir&s;t reading of his Letter, that the Gentleman was far gone in the Spleen. I therefore advi&s;ed him to ri&s;e the next Morning and plunge into the Cold Bath, there to remain under Water 'till he was almo&s;t drowned. This I ordered him to repeat Six Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and on the Seventh, to repair at the wonted Hour to my Lady <HI>Haughty</HI>'s, and to acquaint me afterwards with what he &s;hall meet with there; and particularly to tell me, whether be &s;hall think they &s;tared upon him &s;o much as the Time before. The Gentleman &s;miled; and by his Way of talking to me, &s;hewed him&s;elf a Man of ex|cellent Sen&s;e in all Particulars, unle&s;s when a Cane-Chair, a Round or a Joint-Stool, were &s;po|ken of. He opened his Heart to me at the &s;ame Time concerning &s;everal other Grievances; &s;uch as, being overlook'd in publick A&s;&s;emblies, having his Bows unan&s;wer'd, being helped la&s;t at Table, and placed at the back Part of a Coach; with many other Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which have wither'd his Countenance, and worn him to a Skeleton. Find|ing him a Man of Rea&s;on, I entered into the Bottom of his Di&s;temper. Sir, (&s;aid I) there are
<PB N="195" REF="201">
more of your Con&s;titution in this I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than in any other Part of the World; and I beg the Favour of you to tell me, Whether you do not ob&s;erve, that you meet with mo&s;t Affronts in rainy Days? He an&s;wered candidly, That he had long ob&s;erved, that People were le&s;s &s;awcy in Sun&s;hine, than in cloudy Weather. Upon which I told him plainly, his Di&s;temper was the Spleen; and that though the World was very ill-natured, it was not &s;o bad as he believed it. I further a&s;&s;ured him, That his U&s;e of the Cold Bath, with a Cour&s;e of Steel which I &s;hould pre&s;cribe him, would certainly cure mo&s;t of his Acquaintance of their Rudene&s;s, ill Behaviour, and Impertinence. My Patient &s;miled, and pro|mi&s;ed to ob&s;erve my Pre&s;criptions, not forgetting to give me an Account of their Operation. This Di&s;temper being pretty Epidemical, I &s;hall, for the Benefit of Mankind, give the Publick an Account of the Progre&s;s I make in the Cure of it.</P>

All Things nece&s;&s;ary being prepa|red for making the A&s;&s;ault on the Hornwork and Ravelin of the Attack of <HI>Bertamont,</HI> the Charge began with the Fire of Bombs and Grenades, which was &s;o hot, that the Enemy quitted their Po&s;t, and we lodged our &s;elves on tho&s;e Works with|out Oppo&s;ition. During this Storm, one of our Bombs fell into a Magazine of the Enemy, and blew it up. There are Advices which &s;ay, the Court of <HI>France</HI> had made new Offers of Peace to the Confederates; but this Intelligence wants Confirmation.</P>

<P>THere are two Kinds of Immortality; that which the Soul really enjoys after this Life, and that Imaginary Exi&s;tence by which Men live in their Fame and Reputation. The be&s;t and greate&s;t Actions have proceeded from the Pro|&s;pect of the one or the other of the&s;e; but my De&s;ign is to treat only of tho&s;e who have chiefly propo&s;ed to them&s;elves the latter as the principal Reward of their Labours. It was for this Rea|&s;on that I excluded from my Tables of Fame all the great Founders and Votaries of Religion; and it is for this Rea&s;on al&s;o that I am more than ordinarily anxious to do Ju&s;tice to the Per&s;ons of whom I am now going to &s;peak; for &s;ince Fame was the only End of all their Enterprizes and Studies, a Man cannot be too &s;crupulous in allot|ting them their due Proportion of it. It was this Con&s;ideration which made me call the whole Body of the Learned to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance; to many of whom I mu&s;t own my Obligations for the Ca|talogues of illu&s;trious Per&s;ons which they have &s;ent me in upon this Occa&s;ion. I Ye&s;terday em|ployed the whole Afternoon in comparing them with each other; which made &s;o &s;trong an Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon my Imagination, that they broke
<PB N="198" REF="204">
my Sleep for the fir&s;t Part of the following Night, and at length threw me into a very agree|able Vi&s;ion, which I &s;hall beg Leave to de&s;cribe in all its Particulars.</P>
<P>I dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundle&s;s Plain, that was covered with prodi|gious Multitudes of People, which no Man could number. In the Mid&s;t of it there &s;tood a Moun|tain, with its Head above the Clouds. The Sides were extremely &s;teep, and of &s;uch a particular Structure, that no Creature, which was not made in an Humane Figure, could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;cend it. On a &s;udden there was heard from the Top of it a Sound like that of a Trumpet; but &s;o exceed|ing &s;weet and harmonious, that it filled the Hearts of tho&s;e who heard it with Raptures, and gave &s;uch high and delightful Sen&s;ations, as &s;eemed to animate and rai&s;e Humane Nature a|bove it &s;elf. This made me very much amazed to find &s;o very few in that innumerable Multi|tude, who had Ears fine enough to hear or reli&s;h this Mu&s;ick with Plea&s;ure: But my Wonder a|bated, when, upon looking round me, I &s;aw mo&s;t of them attentive to Three Sirens cloathed like Godde&s;&s;es, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Names of <HI>Sloth, Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> They were &s;eated on Three Rocks, amid&s;t a beautiful Variety of Groves, Meadows, and Rivulets, that lay on the Borders of the Mountain. While the ba&s;e and groveling Multitude of different Nations, Ranks and Ages, were li&s;tening to the &s;edelu|&s;ive Deities, tho&s;e of a more erect A&s;pect, and exalted Spirit, &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, and marched in great Bodies towards the Moun|tain; from whence they heard the Sound, which &s;till grew &s;weeter the more they li&s;tened to it.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden, methought this &s;elect Band &s;prang forward, with a Re&s;olution to climb the A&s;cent, and follow the Call of that Heavenly
<PB N="199" REF="205">
Mu&s;ick. Every one took &s;omething with him that he thought might be of A&s;&s;i&s;tance to him in his March. Several had their Swords drawn, &s;ome carried Rolls of Paper in their Hands, &s;ome had Compa&s;&s;es, others Quadrants, others Tele&s;|copes, and others Pencils; &s;ome had Lawrels on their Heads, and others Buskins on their Legs: In &s;hort, there was &s;carce any In&s;trument of a Mechanick Art or Liberal Science, which was not made U&s;e of on this Occa&s;ion. My good <HI>Daemon,</HI> who &s;tood at my Right Hand during the Cour&s;e of this whole Vi&s;ion, ob&s;erving in me a burning De&s;ire to join that glorious Company, told me, he highly approved that generous Ar|dor with which I &s;eemed tran&s;ported; but at the &s;ame Time advi&s;ed me to cover my Face with a Mask all the while I was to labour on the A&s;cent. I took his Coun&s;el, without inquiring into his Rea&s;ons. The whole Body now broke into dif|ferent Parties, and began to climb the Precipice by Ten Thou&s;and different Paths. Several got into little Allies, which did not reach far up the Hill, before they ended and led no further: And I ob|&s;erved, That mo&s;t of the Artizans, which con&s;idera|bly dimini&s;h'd our Number, fell into the&s;e Paths.</P>
<P>We left another con&s;iderable Body of Adven|turers behind us, who thought they had di&s;co|vered By-Ways up the Hill, which proved &s;o very intricate and perplexed, that after having advanced in them a little, they were quite lo&s;t a|mong the &s;everal Turns and Windings; and tho' they were as active as any in their Motions, they made but little Progre&s;s in the A&s;cent. The&s;e, as my Guide informed me, were Men of &s;ubtle Tempers, and puzzled Politicks, who would &s;upply the Place of real Wi&s;dom with Cunning and Artifice. Among tho&s;e, who were far ad|vanced in their Way, there were &s;ome that by one fal&s;e Step fell backward, and lo&s;t more Ground in a Moment, than they had gain'd for many
<PB N="200" REF="206">
Hours, or could be ever able to recover. We were now advanced very high, and ob&s;erved, That all the different Paths which ran about the Sides of the Mountain, began to meet in Two great Roads, which in&s;en&s;ibly gather'd the whole Multitude of Travellers into Two great Bodies. At a little Di&s;tance from the Entrance of each Road, there &s;tood an hideous Phantom, that op|po&s;ed our further Pa&s;&s;age. One of the&s;e Appari|tions had his Right Hand filled with Darts, which he brandi&s;hed in the Face of all who came up that Way. Crowds ran back at the Appearance of it, and cried out, <HI>Death.</HI> The Spectre that guarded the other Road, was <HI>Envy:</HI> She was not armed with Weapons of De&s;truction like the former; but by dreadful Hi&s;&s;ings, Noi&s;es of Re|proach, and a horrid di&s;tracted Laughter, &s;he appeared more frightful than Death it &s;elf, in&s;o|much that Abundance of our Company were di&s;|couraged from pa&s;&s;ing any further, and &s;ome ap|peared a&s;hamed of having come &s;o far. As for my &s;elf, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my Heart &s;hrunk within me at the Sight of the&s;e gha&s;tly Appearances: But on a &s;udden, the Voice of the Trumpet came more full upon us, &s;o that we felt a new Re&s;olu|tion reviving in us; and in Proportion as this Re&s;olution grew, the Terrors before us &s;eem'd to vani&s;h. Mo&s;t of the Company who had Swords in their Hands, marched on with great Spirit, and an Air of Defiance, up the Road that was commanded by Death; while others, who had Thought and Contemplation in their Looks, went forward in a more compo&s;ed Manner up the Road po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Envy.</HI> The Way above the&s;e Apparitions grew &s;mooth and uniform, and was &s;o delightful, that the Travellers went on with Plea&s;ure, and in a little Time arrived at the Top of the Mountain. They here began to breath a delicious kind of Aether, and &s;aw all the Fields about them covered with a kind of
<PB N="201" REF="207">
Purple Light, that made them reflect with Satis|faction on their pa&s;t Toils, and diffu&s;ed a &s;ecret Joy through the whole A&s;&s;embly, which &s;hewed it &s;elf in every Look and Feature. In the Mid&s;t of the&s;e happy Fields there &s;tood a Palace of a very glorious Structure: It had Four great Fold|ing-Doors, that faced the Four &s;everal Quarters of the World. On the Top of it was enthron'd the Godde&s;s of the Mountain, who &s;miled upon her Votaries, and &s;ounded the Silver Trumpet which had called them up, and cheared them in their Pa&s;&s;age to her Palace. They had now for|med them&s;elves into &s;everal Divi&s;ions, a Band of Hi&s;torians taking their Stations at each Door, according to the Per&s;ons whom they were to in|troduce.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden, the Trumpet, which had hitherto &s;ounded only a March, or a Point of War, now &s;well'd all its Notes into Triumph and Exulta|tion: The whole Fabrick &s;hook, and the Doors flew open. The fir&s;t who &s;tepped forward, was a beautiful and blooming Hero, and as I heard by the Murmurs round me, <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> He was conducted by a Crowd of Hi&s;torians. The Per&s;on who immediately walked before him, was remarkable for an embroider'd Garment, who not being well acquainted with the Place, was conducting him to an Apartment appointed for the Reception of fabulous Heroes. The Name of this fal&s;e Guide was <HI>Quintus Curtius:</HI> But <HI>Arrian</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> who knew better the Avenues of this Palace, conducted him into the great Hall, and placed him at the upper End of the Fir&s;t Table. My good Daemon, that I might &s;ee the whole Ceremony, conveyed me to a Cor|ner of this Room, where I might perceive all that pa&s;&s;ed without being &s;een my &s;elf. The next who entered was a Charming Virgin, lead|ing in a venerable old Man that was blind. Un|der her Left Arm &s;he bore a Harp, and on her
<PB N="202" REF="208">
Head a Garland. <HI>Alexander,</HI> who was very well acquainted with <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;tood up at his Entrance, and placed him on his Right Hand. The Virgin, who it &s;eems was one of the Nine Si&s;ters that attended on the Godde&s;s of <HI>Fame,</HI> &s;miled with an ineffable Grace at their Meeting, and retired. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was now coming forward; and tho' mo&s;t of the Hi&s;torians offered their Service to introduce him, he left them at the Door, and would have no Conductor but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next who advanced, was a Man of a home|ly but chearful A&s;pect, and attended by Per&s;ons of greater Figure than any that appeared on this Occa&s;ion. <HI>Plato</HI> was on his Right Hand, and <HI>Xenophon</HI> on his Left. He bowed to <HI>Homer,</HI> and &s;ate down by him. It was expected that <HI>Plato</HI> would him&s;elf have taken a Place next to his Ma&s;ter <HI>Socrates;</HI> but on a &s;udden there was heard a great Clamour of Di&s;putants at the Door, who appeared with <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> at the Head of them. That Philo&s;opher, with &s;ome Rudene&s;s, but great Strength of Rea&s;on, convinced the whole Table, that a Title to the Fifth Place was his Due, and took it accordingly.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;ate down, when the &s;ame beautiful Virgin that had introduced <HI>Homer</HI> brought in ano|ther, who hung back at the Entrance, and would have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, had not his Mode&s;ty been o|vercome by the Invitation of all who &s;ate at the Ta|ble. His Guide and Behaviour made me ea&s;ily con|clude it was <HI>Virgil. Cicero</HI> next appeared, and took his Place. He had inquired at the Door for one <HI>Luc|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">us</HI> to introduce him; but not finding him there, he contented him&s;elf with the Attendance of many other Writers, who all (except <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI>) ap|peared highly plea&s;ed with the Office.</P>
<P>We waited &s;ome Time in Expectation of the next Worthy, who came in with a great Retinue of Hi&s;torians, who&s;e Names I could not learn, mo&s;t of them being Natives of <HI>Carthage.</HI> The
<PB N="203" REF="209">
Per&s;on thus conducted, who was <HI>Hannibal,</HI> &s;eem|ed much di&s;turbed, and could not forbear com|plaining to the Board of the Affronts he had met with among the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians, who attempt|ed, &s;ays he, to carry me into the Subterraneous Apartment; and perhaps would have done it, had it not been for the Impartiality of this Gentleman, pointing to <HI>Polybius,</HI> who was the only Per&s;on, except my own Countrymen, that was willing to conduct me hither.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carthaginian</HI> took his Seat, and <HI>Pompey</HI> en|tered with great Dignity in his own Per&s;on, and preceded by &s;everal Hi&s;torians. <HI>Lucan</HI> the Poet was at the Head of them, who ob&s;erving <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> at the Table, was going to &s;it down him&s;elf, had not the latter whi&s;per'd him, That whatever Pretence he might otherwi&s;e have had, he forfeit|ed his Claim to it, by coming in as one of the Hi|&s;torians. <HI>Lucan</HI> was &s;o exa&s;perated with the Re|pul&s;e, that he muttered &s;omething to him&s;elf, and was heard to &s;ay, That &s;ince he could not have a Seat among them him&s;elf, he would bring in one who alone had more Merit than their whole A&s;&s;embly: Upon which he went to the Door, and brought in <HI>Cato</HI> of <HI>Utica.</HI> That great Man approached the Company with &s;uch an Air, that &s;howed he contemned the Honour which he laid a Claim to. Ob&s;erving the Seat oppo&s;ite to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was vacant, he took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and &s;poke Two or Three &s;mart Sentences upon the Nature of Precedency, which, according to him, con&s;i&s;ted not in Place, but in intrin&s;ick Merit; to which he added, That the mo&s;t virtuous Man, wherever he was &s;eated, was always at the Up|per End of the Table. <HI>Socrates,</HI> who had a great Spirit of Raillery with his Wi&s;dom, could not forbear &s;miling at a Virtue which took &s;o little Pains to make it &s;elf agreeable. <HI>Cicero</HI> took the Occa&s;ion to make a long Di&s;cour&s;e in Prai&s;e of <HI>Cato,</HI> which he uttered with much Ve|hemence.
<PB N="204" REF="210">
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> an&s;wer'd him with a great deal of &s;eeming Temper; but as I &s;tood at a great Di&s;tance from them, I was not able to hear one Word of what they &s;aid. But I could not forbear taking Notice, That in all the Di&s;cour&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed at the Table, a Word or Nod from <HI>Homer</HI> decided the Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> appeared, looking round him with a &s;erene and affable Countenance upon all the Writers of his Age, who &s;trove a|mong them&s;elves which of them &s;hould &s;how him the greate&s;t Marks of Gratitude and Re&s;pect. <HI>Virgil</HI> ro&s;e from the Table to meet him; and though he was an acceptable Gue&s;t to all, he ap|peared more &s;uch to the Learned, than the Military Worthies. The next Man a&s;toni&s;h'd the whole Ta|ble with his Appearance: He was &s;low, &s;olemn, and &s;ilent, in his Behaviour, and wore a Raimens curiou&s;ly wrought with Hieroglyphicks. As he came into the middle of the Room, he threw back the Skirt of it, and di&s;covered a Golden Thigh. <HI>Socrates,</HI> at the Sight of it, declared again&s;t keeping Company with any who were not made of Fle&s;h and Blood; and therefore de|&s;ired <HI>Diogenes</HI> the <HI>Laertian</HI> to lead him to the Apartment allotted for Fabulous Heroes, and Worthies of dubious Exi&s;tence. At his going out, he told them, That they did not know whom they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; that he was now <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> the Fir&s;t of Philo&s;ophers, and that formerly he had been a very brave Man at the Siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> That may be very true, &s;aid <HI>Socrates;</HI> but you forgot that you have likewi&s;e been a very great Harlot in your Time. This Exclu&s;ion made Way for <HI>Ar|chimedes,</HI> who came forward with a Scheme of Mathematical Figures in his Hand; among which, I ob&s;erv'd a Cone and a Cylinder.</P>
<P>Seeing this Table full, I de&s;ired my Guide for Variety to lead me to the Fabulous Apartment,
<PB N="205" REF="211">
the Roof of which was painted with Gorgons, Chimaera's, and Centaurs, with many other Em|blematical Figures, which I wanted both Time and Skill to unriddle. The Fir&s;t Table was al|mo&s;t full: At the upper End &s;at <HI>Hercules</HI> leaning an Arm upon his Club; on his Right Hand were <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and between them <HI>Aeneas;</HI> on his Left were <HI>Hector, The&s;eus.</HI> and <HI>Ja&s;on:</HI> The lower End had <HI>Orpheus, Ae&s;op, Phalaris,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;aeus.</HI> The U&s;her &s;eem'd at a Lo&s;s for a Twelfth Man, when, methought, to my great Joy and Surprize, I heard &s;ome at the lower End of the Table mention <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff:</HI> But tho&s;e of the upper End receiv'd it with Di&s;dain, and &s;aid, If they mu&s;t have a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worthy, they would have <HI>Robin Hood.</HI></P>
<P>While I was tran&s;ported with the Honour that was done me, and burning with Envy again&s;t my Competitor, I was awaken'd by the Noi&s;e of the Cannon which were then fired for the taking of <HI>Mons.</HI> I &s;hould have been very much trou|bled at being thrown out of &s;o plea&s;ing a Vi|&s;ion on any other Occa&s;ion; but thought it an agreeable Change to have my Thoughts diverted from the Greate&s;t among the Dead and Fabulous Heroes, to the mo&s;t Famous among the Real and the Living.</P>

<P>AFter the Mind has been employ'd on Contem|plations &s;uitable to its Greatne&s;s, it is unna|tural to run into &s;udden Mirth or Levity; but we mu&s;t let the Soul &s;ub&s;ide as it ro&s;e, by proper De|grees. My late Con&s;iderations of the ancient Heroes impre&s;&s;ed a certain Gravity upon my Mind, which is much above the little Gratifica|tion receiv'd from Starts of Humour and Fancy, and threw me into a plea&s;ing Sadne&s;s. In this State of Thought I have been looking at the Fire, and in a pen&s;ive Manner reflecting upon the great Misfortunes and Calamities incident to Hu|mane Life; among which there are none that touch &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as tho&s;e which befal Per&s;ons who eminently love, and meet with fatal Inter|ruptions of their Happine&s;s when they lea&s;t ex|pect it. The Piety of Children to Parents, and the Affection of Parents to their Children, are the Effects of In&s;tinct; but the Affection between Lovers and Friends is founded on Rea&s;on and Choice, which has always made me think, the Sorrows of the latter much more to be pitied than tho&s;e of the former. The Contemplation of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this Sort &s;oftens the Mind of Man, and makes the Heart better. It extingui&s;hes the Seeds of Envy and ill Will towards Mankind, corrects the Pride of Pro&s;perity, and beats down
<PB N="207" REF="213">
all that Fiercene&s;s and In&s;olence which are apt to get into the Minds of the Daring and Fortunate.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on the wi&s;e <HI>Athenians,</HI> in their Theatrical Performances, laid before the Eyes of the People the greate&s;t Afflictions which could be|fal Humane Life, and in&s;en&s;ibly poli&s;h'd their Tempers by &s;uch Repre&s;entations. Among the Modern, indeed there has aro&s;e a Chimerical Method of di&s;po&s;ing the Fortune of the Per&s;ons repre&s;ented, according to what they call Poetical Ju&s;tice; and letting none be unhappy but tho&s;e who de&s;erve it. In &s;uch Ca&s;es, an intelligent Spectator, if he is concern'd, knows he ought not to be &s;o; and can learn nothing from &s;uch a Tenderne&s;s, but that he is a weak Creature, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions cannot follow the Dictates of his Under&s;tanding. It is very natural, when one is got into &s;uch a Way of Thinking, to recollect tho&s;e Examples of Sorrow which have made the &s;tronge&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion upon our Imaginations. An In&s;tance or Two of &s;uch you'll give me Leave to communicate.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman and Lady of ancient and honourable Hou&s;es in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> had from their Childhood entertained for each other a generous and noble Pa&s;&s;ion, which had been long oppo&s;ed by their Friends, by Rea&s;on of the Inequality of their Fortunes; but their Con&s;tancy to each other, and Obedience to tho&s;e on whom they depended, wrought &s;o much upon their Relations, that the&s;e celebrated Lovers were at length joined in Mar|riage. Soon after their Nuptials, the Bridegroom was obliged to go into a Foreign Country, to take Care of a con&s;iderable Fortune which was left him by a Relation, and came very opportunely to improve their moderate Circum&s;tances. They re|ceived the Congratulations of all the Country on this Occa&s;ion; and I remember it was a common Sentence in every one's Mouth, <HI>You &s;ee how faith|ful Love is rewarded.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214">
He took this agreeable Voyage, and &s;ent Home every Po&s;t fre&s;h Accounts of his Succe&s;s in his Affairs Abroad; but at la&s;t (though he de&s;igned to return with the next Ship) he lamented in his Letters, that Bu&s;ine&s;s would detain him &s;ome Time longer from Home, becau&s;e he would give him&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of an unexpected Arrival.</P>
<P>The young Lady, after the Heat of the Day, walked every Evening on the Sea-Shore, near which &s;he lived, with a familiar Friend, her Hus|band's Kin&s;woman, and diverted her &s;elf with what Objects they met there, or upon Di&s;cour&s;es of the future Methods of Life in the happy Change of their Circum&s;tances. They &s;tood one Even|ing on the Shore together in a perfect Tranqui|lity, ob&s;erving the Setting of the Sun, the calm Face of the Deep, and the &s;ilent Heaving of the Waves which gently rolled towards them, and broke at their Feet; when at a Di&s;tance her Kin&s;woman &s;aw &s;omething float on the Wa|ters, which &s;he fancied was a Che&s;t; and with a Smile told her, &s;he &s;aw it fir&s;t, and if it came a&s;hore full of Jewels, &s;he had a Right to it. They both fixed their Eyes upon it, and enter|tained them&s;elves with the Subject of the Wreck, the Cou&s;in &s;till a&s;&s;erting her Right; but promi&s;ing, if it was a Prize, to give her a very rich Coral for the Child, of which &s;he was then big, provided &s;he might be Godmother. Their Mirth &s;oon abated, when they ob&s;erv'd upon the nearer Approach, that it was a humane Body. The young Lady, who had a Heart naturally fil|led with Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, made many me|lancholy Reflections on the Occa&s;ion. Who knows (&s;aid &s;he) but this Man may be the only Hope and Heir of a wealthy Hou&s;e; the Dar|ling of indulgent Parents, who are now in im|pertinent Mirth, and plea&s;ing them&s;elves with the Thoughts of offering him a Bride they have got ready for him? Or, may he not be the Ma&s;ter of
<PB N="209" REF="215">
a Family that wholly depended upon his Life? There may, for ought we know, be half a Dozen Fatherle&s;s Children, and a tender Wife, now expos'd to Poverty by his Death. What Plea&s;ure might he have promi&s;ed him&s;elf in the different Welcome he was to have from her and them? But let us go away, 'tis a dreadful Sight! The be&s;t Office we can do, is to take Care that the poor Man, whoever he is, may be decently buried. She turned away when a Wave threw the Carca&s;s on the Shore. The Kin&s;woman im|mediately &s;hriek'd out, Oh, my Cou&s;in! and fell upon the Ground. The unhappy Wife went to help her Friend, when &s;he &s;aw her own Husband at her Feet, and dropt in a Swoon upon the Bo|dy. An old Woman, who had been the Gentle|man's Nur&s;e, came out about this Time to call the Ladies in to Supper, and found her Child (as &s;he always called him) dead on the Shore, her Mi&s;tre&s;s and Kin&s;woman both lying dead by him. Her loud Lamentations, and calling her young Ma&s;ter to Life, &s;oon awaked the Friend from her Trance; but the Wife was gone for ever.</P>
<P>When the Family and Neighbourhood got to|gether round the Bodies, no one asked any Que|&s;tion, but the Objects before them told the Story.</P>
<P>Incidents of this Nature are the more moving, when they are drawn by Per&s;ons concerned in the Cata&s;trophe, notwith&s;tanding they are often oppre&s;&s;ed beyond the Power of giving them in a di&s;tinct Light, except we gather their Sorrow from their Inability to &s;peak it.</P>
<P>I have Two Original Letters written both on the &s;ame Day, which are to me exqui&s;ite in their diffe|rent Kinds. The Occa&s;ion was this: A Gentleman who had courted a mo&s;t agreeable young Woman, and won her Heart, obtained al&s;o the Con&s;ent of her Father, to whom &s;he was an only Child. The old Man had a Fancy that they &s;hould be married in the &s;ame Church where he him&s;elf was, in a Vil|lage

They had the mo&s;t agreeable Journey imaginable to the Place of Marriage: From whence the Bridegroom writ the following Let|ter to his Wife's Father:</P>

<P>The Villagers were a&s;&s;embling about the Church, and the happy Couple took a Walk in a private Garden. The Bridegroom's Man knew his Ma&s;ter would leave the Place on a &s;udden af|ter the Wedding, and &s;eeing him draw his Pi|&s;tols the Night before, took this Opportunity to go into his Chamber, and charge them. Upon their Return from the Garden, they went into that Room; and after a little &s;ond Raillery on the Subject of their Court&s;hip, the Lover took up a Pi&s;tol, which he knew he had unloaded the Night before, and pre&s;enting it to her, &s;aid with the mo&s;t graceful Air, whil&s;t &s;he look'd plea&s;ed at his agreeable Flattery, Now, Madam, repent of all tho&s;e Cruelties you have been guilty of to me;

<P>IT is my frequent Practice to vi&s;it Places of Re|&s;ort in this Town where I am lea&s;t known, to ob&s;erve what Reception my Works meet with in the World, and what good Effects I may promi&s;e my &s;elf from my Labours: And it being a Privi|lege a&s;&s;erted by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montaigne</HI> and others, of vain-glorious Memory, That we Writers of E&s;&s;ays may talk of our &s;elves; I take the Liber|ty to give an Account of the Remarks which I find are made by &s;ome of my gentle Readers upon the&s;e my Di&s;&s;ertations.</P>
<P>I happen'd this Evening to fall into a Coffee-hou&s;e near the <HI>'Change,</HI> where Two Per&s;ons were reading my Account of the Table of <HI>Fame.</HI> The one of the&s;e was commenting as he read, and ex|plaining who was meant by this and t'other Wor|thy as he pa&s;&s;ed on. I ob&s;erv'd the Per&s;on over|again&s;t him wonderfully intent and &s;atisfied with his Explanation. When he came to <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who is &s;aid to have refu&s;ed any Conductor to the Table; No no, &s;aid he, he is in the right of it, he has Money enough to be welcome wherever he comes; and then whi&s;pered, He means a certain Colonel of the Train-Bands. Upon reading, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> made his Claim with &s;ome Rude|ne&s;s, but great Strength of Rea&s;on; Who can that be, &s;o rough and &s;o rea&s;onable? It mu&s;t be &s;ome Whig, I warrant you. There is nothing

but Party in the&s;e publick Papers. Where <HI>Pytha|goras</HI> is &s;aid to have a Golden Thigh; Ay, ay, &s;aid he, he has Money enough in his Breeches; that is the Alderman of our Ward. You mu&s;t know, whatever he read, I found he interpreted from his own Way of Life and Acquaintance. I am glad my Readers can con&s;true for them&s;elves the&s;e difficult Points; but for the Benefit of Po|&s;terity, I de&s;ign, when I come to write my la&s;t Paper of this Kind, to make it an Explanation of all my former.

<P>But I mu&s;t turn my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e to what is of yet greater Regard to me than the Care of my Writings; that is to &s;ay, the Pre&s;ervation of a Lady's Heart.

<P>There is &s;omething wonderfully plea&s;ing in the Favour of Women; and this Letter has put me in &s;o good an Humour, that nothing could di&s;plea&s;e me &s;ince I received it. My Boy breaks Gla&s;&s;es and Pipes, and in&s;tead of giving him a Knock of the Pate, as my Way is, (for I hate &s;colding at Servants,) I only &s;ay, <HI>Ah,</HI> Jack! <HI>Thou ha&s;t a Head, and &s;o has a Pin;</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch merry Expre&s;&s;ion. But alas! How am I morti|fied when he is putting on my fourth Pair of Stockings on the&s;e poor Spindles of mine? <HI>The Fair One under&s;tands Love better than I A&s;trono|my!</HI> I am &s;ure, without the Help of that Art, this poor meagre Trunk of mine is a very ill Habitation for Love. She is plea&s;ed to &s;peak civilly of my Sen&s;e; but <HI>Ingenium male habitat</HI> is an invincible Difficulty in Ca&s;es of this Na|ture. I had always indeed, from a Pa&s;&s;ion to plea&s;e the Eyes of the Fair, a great Plea&s;ure in Dre&s;s. Add to this, That I have writ Songs &s;ince I was Sixty, and have lived with all the Circum|&s;pection of an old Beau, as I am: But my Friend <HI>Horace</HI> has very well &s;aid, <HI>Every Year takes &s;ome|thing</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="221">
<HI>from us;</HI> and in&s;tructed me to form my Pur|&s;uits and De&s;ires according to the Stage of my Life: Therefore I have no more to value my &s;elf upon, than that I can conver&s;e with young Peo|ple without Peevi&s;hne&s;s, or wi&s;hing my &s;elf a Moment younger. For which Rea&s;on, when I am among&s;t 'em, I rather moderate than inter|rupt their Diver&s;ions. But though I have this Complacency, I mu&s;t not pretend to write to a Lady civil Things, as <HI>Maria</HI> de&s;ires. Time was, when I could have told her, I had received a Letter from her Fair Hands; and, That if this Paper trembled as &s;he read it, it then be&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ed its Author, or &s;ome other gay Conceit. Though I never &s;aw her, I could have told her, That good Sen&s;e and good Humour &s;miled in her Eyes; That Con&s;tancy and good Nature dwelt in her Heart; That Beauty and good Breeding appeared in all her Actions. When I was Five and Twenty, upon Sight of one Sylla|ble, even wrong &s;pelt, by a Lady I never &s;aw, I could tell her, That her Height was that which was fit for inviting our Approach, and com|manding our Re&s;pect; That a Smile &s;ate on her Lips, which prefaced her Expre&s;&s;ions before &s;he uttered them, and her A&s;pect prevented her Speech. All &s;he could &s;ay, though &s;he had an infinite deal of Wit, was but a Repetition of what was expre&s;&s;ed by her Form; her Form, which &s;truck her Beholders with Ideas more moving and forcible, than ever were in&s;pired by Mu&s;ick, Painting, or Eloquence. At this Rate I panted in tho&s;e Days; but, Ah! Sixty Three! I am very &s;orry I can only return the agreeable <HI>Maria</HI> a Pa&s;&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed rather from the Head than the Heart.</P>

<P>I Have left the Town &s;ome Time; and much the &s;ooner, for not having had the Advan|tage, when I lived there, of &s;o good a Pilot as you are to this pre&s;ent Age. Your Cautions to the young Men again&s;t the Vices of the Town are very well: But there is one not le&s;s needful, which I think you have omitted. I had from the Rough Diamond, (a Gentleman &s;o called from an hone&s;t blunt Wit he had,) not long &s;ince dead, this Ob&s;ervation, That a young Man mu&s;t be at lea&s;t Three or Four Years in <HI>London</HI> before he dares &s;ay, <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily &s;ee the Truth and Force of this Ob&s;ervation; for I believe, more People are drawn away again&s;t their Inclinations, than with them. A young Man is afraid to de|ny any Body going to a Tavern to Dinner; or

after being gorged there, to repeat the &s;ame with another Company at Supper, or to drink exce&s;&s;ively if de&s;ired, or go to any other Place, or commit any other Extravagancy propo&s;ed. The Fear of being thought covetous, to have no Money, or to be under the Dominion or Fear of his Parents and Friends, hinder him from the free Exerci&s;e of his Under&s;tanding, and af|firming boldly the true Rea&s;on, which is, his real Di&s;like of what is de&s;ired.

<P>I Have received a Letter &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>A. B.</HI> wherein it has been repre&s;ented to me as an Enormity, That there are more than ordinary Crowds of Women at the <HI>Old-Baily</HI> when a Rape is to be try'd: But by Mr. <HI>A. B.</HI>'s Favour, I can't tell who are &s;o much concern'd in that Part of the Law as the Sex he mentions, they being the only Per&s;ons liable to &s;uch In&s;ults. Nor indeed do I think it more unrea&s;onable that they &s;hould be inqui&s;itive on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, than Men of Honour, when one is try'd for killing another in a Duel. It is very natural to enquire how the fatal Pa&s;s was made, that we may the better defend our &s;elves when we come to be attack'd. Several eminent Ladies ap|peared lately at the Court of Ju&s;tice on &s;uch an Oc|ca&s;ion, and with great Patience and Attention &s;tay|ed the whole Trials of two Per&s;ons for the above|&s;aid Crime. The Law to me indeed &s;eems a little defective in this Point; and it is a very great Hard|&s;hip, that this Crime, which is committed by Men only, &s;hould have Men only on their Jury. I hum|bly therefore propo&s;e, That on future Tryals of this Sort, half of the Twelve may be Women; and tho&s;e &s;uch who&s;e Faces are well known to have taken Notes, or may be &s;uppo&s;ed to remem|ber what happened in former Trials in the &s;ame Place. There is the learned <HI>Androgyne,</HI> that would make a good Fore-woman of the Pannel, who (by long Attendance) under&s;tands as much Law and Anatomy as is nece&s;&s;ary in this Ca&s;e. Till this is taken Care of, I am humbly of Opi|nion, it would be much more expedient that the Fair were wholly ab&s;ent: For to what End can
<PB N="219" REF="225">
it be, that they &s;hould be pre&s;ent at &s;uch Exami|nations, when they can only be perplexed with a Fellow-feeling for the Injured, without any Power to avenge their Sufferings. It is an unne|ce&s;&s;ary Pain which the Fair Ones give them&s;elves on the&s;e Occa&s;ions. I have known a young Wo|man &s;hriek out at &s;ome Parts of the Evidence; and have frequently ob&s;erv'd, That when the Proof grew particular and &s;trong, there has been &s;uch an univer&s;al Flutter of Fans, that one would think the whole Female Audience were falling in|to Fits. Nor indeed can I &s;ee how Men them&s;elves can be wholly unmov'd at &s;uch Tragical Relations.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I mu&s;t tell my Female Readers, and they may take an old Man's Word for it, That there is nothing in Woman &s;o graceful and be|coming as Mode&s;ty: It adds Charms to their Beauty, and gives a new Softne&s;s to their Sex. Without it, Simplicity and Innocence appear rude, Reading and good Sen&s;e ma&s;culine, Wit and Ho|nour la&s;civious. This is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Qualifica|tion for plea&s;ing, that the loo&s;e Part of Woman|kind, who&s;e Study it is to in&s;nare Men's Hearts, never fail to &s;upport the Appearance of what they know is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to that End: And I have heard it reported by the young Fellows in my Time, as a Maxim of the celebrated Madam <HI>Ben|net,</HI> That a young Wench, tho' never &s;o beauti|ful, was not worth her Board when he was pa&s;t her Blu&s;hing.

When my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI> was in her Sampler, I made her get the whole Story without Book, and tell it me in Needle-work. This illu&s;trious Lady &s;tands up in Hi&s;tory, as the Glory of her own Sex, and the Reproach of ours; and the Circum&s;tances under which &s;he fell were &s;o very particular, that they &s;eem to make Adultery and Murder meritorious. She was a Woman of &s;uch tran&s;cendent Virtue, that her Beauty, which was the greate&s;t of the Age and Country in which &s;he lived, and is generally celebrated as the highe&s;t of Prai&s;e in other Women, is never mentioned as a Part of her Character. But it would be de|claiming to dwell upon &s;o celebrated a Story, which I mentioned only in Re&s;pect to my Kin&s;|woman; and to make Reparation for the Omi&s;&s;ion they complain of, do further promi&s;e 'em, That if they can furni&s;h me with In&s;tances to fill it, there &s;hall be a &s;mall Tea-Table &s;et apart in my Palace of Fame for the Reception of all of her Cha|racter.</P>

But it is the Way of the&s;e Great Men, when they lie be|hind their Lines, and are in a Time of Inaction, as they call it, to pa&s;s away their Time in wri|ting their Exploits. By this Means, &s;everal who are either unknown or de&s;pi&s;ed in the pre&s;ent Age, will be famous in the next, unle&s;s a &s;udden Stop be put to &s;uch pernicious Practices. There are others of that gay People, who (as I am in|formed) will live half a Year together in a Gar|ret,
<PB N="222" REF="228">
and write an Hi&s;tory of their Intrigues in the Court of <HI>France.</HI> As for Politicians, they do not abound with that Species of Men &s;o much as we; but as ours are not &s;o famous for writing, as for extemporary Di&s;&s;ertations in Coffee-hou&s;es, they are more annoy'd with Memoirs of this Na|ture al&s;o than we are. The mo&s;t immediate Re|medy that I can apply to prevent this growing Evil; is, that I do hereby give Notice to all Book|&s;ellers and Tran&s;lators what&s;oever, That the Word <HI>Memoir</HI> is <HI>French</HI> for a Novel; and to re|quire of them, That they &s;ell and tran&s;late it ac|cordingly.</P>

<P>Coming into this Place to Night, I met an old Friend of mine, who, a little after the Re&s;tora|tion, writ an Epigram with &s;ome Applau&s;e, which he has lived upon ever &s;ince; and by Ver|tue of it, has been a con&s;tant Frequenter of this Coffee-hou&s;e for Forty Years.

<P>MY Brother <HI>Tranquillus,</HI> who is a Man of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, came to me this Morning into my Study, and after very many civil Expre&s;&s;ions in Return for what good Offices I had done him, told me, he de&s;ired to carry his Wife my Si&s;ter that very Morning to his own Hou&s;e. I readily told him I would wait upon him, without ask|ing why he was &s;o impatient to rob us of his good Company. He went out of my Chamber, and I thought &s;eem'd to have a little Heavine&s;s upon him, which gave me &s;ome Di&s;quiet. Soon after, my Si&s;ter came to me with a very Matron-like Air, and mo&s;t &s;edate Satisfaction in her Looks, which &s;poke her very much at Ea&s;e; but the Traces of her Countenance &s;eem'd to di&s;cover that &s;he had been lately in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and that Air of Content to flow from a certain Triumph upon &s;ome Advantage obtained. She no &s;ooner &s;ate down by me, but I perceived &s;he was one of tho&s;e Ladies who begin to be Managers within the Time of their being Brides.&mdash;Without letting her &s;peak, (which I &s;aw &s;he had a mighty Incli|nation to do) I &s;aid, Here has been your Hu&s;|band, who tells me he has a Mind to go Home this very Morning; and I have con&s;ented to it. It is well, &s;aid &s;he, for you mu&s;t know&mdash;Nay, <HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;aid I, I beg your Pardon, for 'tis you
<PB N="224" REF="230">
mu&s;t know&mdash;You are to under&s;tand, that now is the Time to fix or alienate your Husband's Heart for ever; and I fear you have been a little indi&s;creet in your Expre&s;&s;ions or Behaviour to|wards him, even here in my Hou&s;e. There has, &s;ays &s;he, been &s;ome Words; but I'll be judge by you if he was not in the Wrong: Nay, I need not be judg'd by any Body, for he gave it up him&s;elf, and &s;aid not a Word when he &s;aw me grow pa&s;&s;ionate, but, Madam, you are perfectly in the Right of it: As you &s;hall judge&mdash;Nay, Madam, &s;aid I, I am Judge already, and tell you, that you are perfectly in the Wrong of it; for if it was a Matter of Importance, I know he has bet|ter Sen&s;e than you; if a Trifle, you know what I told you on your Wedding-Day, that you were to be above little Provocations. She knows very well I can be &s;ower upon Occa&s;ion, therefore gave me Leave to go on.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, I will not enter into the Di&s;pute between you, which I find his Prudence put an End to before it came to Extremity, but charge you to have a Care of the fir&s;t Quarrel, as you tender your Happine&s;s; for then it is, that the Mind will reflect har&s;hly upon every Circum&s;tance that has ever pa&s;s'd between you. If &s;uch an Accident is ever to happen, (which I hope never will) be &s;ure to keep to the Circum&s;tance before you; make no Allu&s;ions to what is pa&s;s'd, or Conclu&s;ions re|ferring to what is to come: Don't &s;how an Hoard of Matter for Di&s;&s;ention in your Brea&s;t; but if it is nece&s;&s;ary, lay before him the Thing as you un|der&s;tand it, candidly, without being a&s;hamed of acknowledging an Error, or proud of being in the Right. If a young Couple be not careful in this Point, they will get into an Habit of Wran|gling: And when to Di&s;plea&s;e is thought of no Con&s;equence, to Plea&s;e is always of as little Mo|ment. There is a Play, <HI>Jenny,</HI> I have formerly been at when I was a Student: We got into a
<PB N="225" REF="231">
dark Corner with a Porringer of Brandy, and threw Rai&s;ins into it, then &s;et it on Fire. My Chamber-fellow and I diverted our &s;elves with the Sport of venturing our Fingers for the Rai|&s;ins; and the Wantonne&s;s of the Thing was, to &s;ee each other look like a Daemon, as we burnt our &s;elves and &s;natched out the Fruit. This fan|ta&s;tical Mirth was called <HI>Snap-Dragon.</HI> You may go into many a Family, where you &s;ee the Man and Wife at this Sport: Every Word at their Ta|ble alludes to &s;ome Pa&s;&s;age between them&s;elves; and you &s;ee by the Palene&s;s and Emotion in their Countenance, that it is for your Sake, and not their own, that they forbear playing out the whole Game, in burning each others Fingers. In this Ca&s;e, the whole Purpo&s;e of Life is inverted, and the Ambition turns upon a certain Conten|tion, who &s;hall contradict be&s;t, and not upon an Inclination to excel in Kindne&s;&s;es and good Offices. Therefore, dear <HI>Jenny,</HI> remember me, and avoid <HI>Snap-Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>I thank you Brother, (&s;aid &s;he) but you don't know how he loves me; I find I can do any Thing with him. If you can &s;o, Why &s;hould you de&s;ire to do any Thing but plea&s;e him? But I have a Word or Two more before you go out of the Room; for I &s;ee you do not like the Subject I am upon. Let nothing provoke you to fall upon an Imperfection he cannot help; for if he has a re&s;enting Spirit, he will think your Aver&s;ion as immoveable as the Imperfection with which you upbraid him. But above all, dear <HI>Jenny,</HI> be care|ful of one Thing, and you will be &s;omething more than Woman, that is, a Levity you are al|mo&s;t all guilty of, which is, to take a Plea&s;ure in your Power to give Pain. It is ev'n in a Mi&s;tre&s;s an Argument of Meanne&s;s of Spirit, but in a Wife it is Inju&s;tice and Ingratitude. When a &s;en&s;ible Man once ob&s;erves this in a Woman, he mu&s;t have a very great, or a very little, Spirit to over|look
<PB N="226" REF="232">
it. A Woman ought therefore to con&s;ider very often, how few Men there are who will regard a meditated Offence as a Weakne&s;s of Temper.</P>
<P>I was going on in my Confabulation, when <HI>Tranquillus</HI> entered. She ca&s;t her Eyes upon him with much Shame and Confu&s;ion, mixed with great Complacency and Love, and went up to him. He took her in his Arms, and looked &s;o many &s;oft Things at one Glance, that I could &s;ee he was glad I had been talking to her, &s;orry &s;he had been troubled, and angry at him&s;elf that he could not di&s;gui&s;e the Concern he was in an Hour before. After which, he &s;ays to me, with an Air aukward enough, but methought not unbecoming, I have altered my Mind, Brother; we'll live up|on you a Day or Two longer. I reply'd, That's what I have been per&s;wading <HI>Jenny</HI> to ask of you; but &s;he is re&s;olv'd never to contradict your Incli|nation, and refus'd me.</P>
<P>We were going on in that Way which one hardly knows how to expre&s;s; as when Two People mean the &s;ame Thing in a nice Ca&s;e, but come at it by talking as di&s;tantly from it as they can; when very opportunely came in upon us an hone&s;t incon&s;iderable Fellow, <HI>Tim, Dapper,</HI> a Gen|tleman well known to us both. <HI>Tim,</HI> is one of tho&s;e who are very nece&s;&s;ary by being very in|con&s;iderable. <HI>Tim.</HI> dropt in at an Incident when we knew not how to fall into either a grave or a merry Way. My Si&s;ter took this Occa&s;ion to make off, and <HI>Dapper</HI> gave us an Account of all the Company he had been in to Day, who was and who was not at Home, where he vi&s;ited. This <HI>Tim.</HI> is the Head of a Species: He is a little out of his Element in this Town; but he is a Relation of <HI>Tranquillus,</HI> and his Neighbour in the Country, which is the true Place of Re&s;i|dence for this Species. The Habit of a <HI>Dapper,</HI> when he is at Home, is a light Broad Cloth with Calamanco or Red Wa&s;tcoat and Breeches
<PB N="227" REF="233">
and it is remarkable, that their Wigs &s;eldom hide the Collar of their Coats. They have al|ways a peculiar Spring in their Arms, a Riggle in their Bodies, and a Trip in their Gate. All which Motions they expre&s;s at once in their Drinking, Bowing, or &s;aluting Ladies; for a di|&s;tant Imitation of a forward Fop, and a Re&s;olu|tion to over-top him in his Way, are the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Marks of a <HI>Dapper.</HI> The&s;e Under-Cha|racters of Men are Parts of the &s;ociable World by no Means to be neglected: They are like Pegs in a Building. They make no Figure in it, but hold the Structure together, and are as ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary as the Pillars and Columns. I am &s;ure we found it &s;o this Morning; for <HI>Tranquil|lus</HI> and I &s;hould perhaps have look'd cold at each other the whole Day, but <HI>Dapper</HI> fell in with his brisk Way, &s;hook us both by the Hand, rally'd the Bride, mi&s;took the Acceptance he met with among&s;t us for extraordinary Perfection in him|&s;elf, and heartily pleas'd, and was pleas'd, all the while he &s;tay'd. His Company left us all in good Humour, and we were not &s;uch Fools as to let it &s;ink, before we confirmed it by great Chearful|ne&s;s and Openne&s;s in our Carriage the whole Evening.</P>

<P>I have been this Evening to vi&s;it a Lady who is a Relation of the enamour'd <HI>Cynthio,</HI> and there heard the melancholy News of his Death. I was in Hopes, that Fox-hunting and <HI>October</HI> would have recovered him from his unhappy Pa&s;&s;ion. He went into the Country with a De&s;ign to leave behind him all Thoughts of <HI>Clari&s;&s;a;</HI> but he found that Place only more convenient to think of her without Interruption. The Country Gen|tlemen were very much puzzled upon his Ca&s;e, and never finding him merry or loud in their Company, took him for a Roman Catho|lick, and immediately upon his Death &s;eiz'd his
<PB N="228" REF="234">
<HI>French</HI> Valet-de-Chambre for a Prie&s;t; and it is generally thought in the County, it will go hard with him next Se&s;&s;ion. Poor <HI>Cynthio</HI> never held up his Head after having received a Letter of <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI>'s Marriage. The Lady who gave me this Account being far gone in Poetry and Romance, told me, If I would give her an Epitaph, &s;he would take Care to have it placed on his Tomb; which &s;he her &s;elf had devis'd in the following Manner: It is to be made of black Marble, and every Corner to be crowned with weeping Cu|pids. Their Quivers are to be hung up upon Two tall Cypre&s;s Trees, which are to grow on each Side of the Monument, and their Arrows to be laid in a great Heap, after the Manner of a Funeral Pile, on which is to lie the Body of the Deceas'd. On the Top of each Cypre&s;s is to &s;tand the Figure of a Moaning Turtle-Dove. On the uppermo&s;t Part of the Monument, the God|de&s;s to whom the&s;e Birds are &s;acred, is to &s;it in a dejected Po&s;ture, as weeping for the Death of her Votary. I need not tell you this Lady's Head is a little turned: However, to be rid of Importuni|ties, I promi&s;ed her an Epitaph, and told her, I would take for my Pattern that of Don <HI>Alonzo,</HI> who was no le&s;s famous in his Age than <HI>Cynthio</HI> is in ours.</P>
<Q>The EPITAPH:<LB> Here lies Don <HI>Alonzo,</HI><LB> Slain by a Wound receiv'd under<LB> His Left Pap;<LB> The Orifice of which was &s;o<LB> Small, no Surgeon could<LB> Di&s;cover it.</Q>

</LETTER>
<P>I received this Me&s;&s;age with le&s;s Surprize than I believe Mr. <HI>Thrifty</HI> imagined; for I knew the good Company too well to feel any Palpitations at their Approach: But I was in very great Con|cern how I &s;hould adju&s;t the Ceremonial, and demean my &s;elf to all the&s;e great Men, who per|haps had not &s;een any Thing above them&s;elves for the&s;e Twenty Years la&s;t pa&s;t.

that's the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Harry.</HI> Be&s;ides which, I was &s;en&s;ible that there was a great Point in ad|ju&s;ting my Behaviour to the &s;imple 'Squire, &s;o as to give him Satisfaction, and not di&s;oblige the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Quorum.</HI></P>
<P>The Hour of Nine was come this Morning, and I had no &s;ooner &s;et Chairs, (by the Steward's Let|ter) and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">xed my Tea-Equipage, but I heard a Knock at my Door, which was opened, but no one enter'd; after which follow'd a long Silence, which was broke at la&s;t by, Sir, I beg your Par|don; I think I know better: And another Voice, Nay, good Sir <HI>Giles</HI> &mdash; I looked out from my Window, and &s;aw the good Company all with their Hats off, and Arms &s;pread, offering the Door to each other. After many Offers, they enter'd with much Solemnity, in the Order Mr. <HI>Thrifty</HI> was &s;o kind as to name 'em to me. But they are now got to my Chamber-Door, and I &s;aw my old Friend Sir <HI>Harry</HI> enter. I met him with all the Re&s;pect due to &s;o reverend a Vegetable; for you are to know, that is my Sen&s;e of a Per&s;on who remains idle in the &s;ame Place for half a Century. I got him with great Succe&s;s into his Chair by the Fire, without throwing down any of my Cups. The Knight-Batchelor told me, he had a great Re&s;pect for my whole Family, and would, with my Leave, place him&s;elf next to Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> at who&s;e Right Hand he had &s;ate at every Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions this Thirty Years, unle&s;s he was Sick. The Steward in the Rear whi&s;|pered the young Templer, That's true to my Knowledge. I had the Misfortune, as they &s;tood Cheek by Jole, to de&s;ire the &s;imple 'Squire to &s;it down before the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> to the no &s;mall Satisfaction of the former, and Re&s;entment of the latter: But I &s;aw my Error too late, and got 'em as &s;oon as I could into their Seats. Well, &s;aid I, Gentlemen, after I have told you how glad I am of this great Honour, I am to de&s;ire
<PB N="231" REF="237">
you to drink a Di&s;h of Tea. They an&s;wered one and all, That they never drank Tea in a Morning. Not in a Morning! &s;aid I, &s;taring round me. Upon which the pert Jackanapes <HI>Nick Doubt</HI> tipp'd me the Wink, and put out his Tongue at his Grandfather. Here followed a profound Silence, while the Steward in his Boots and Whip propo&s;ed, That we &s;hould adjourn to &s;ome Publick Hou&s;e, where every Body might call for what they pleas'd, and enter upon the Bu|&s;ine&s;s. We all &s;tood up in an In&s;tant, and Sir <HI>Har|ry</HI> fil'd off from the Left very di&s;creetly, counter|marching behind the Chairs towards the Door: After him, Sir <HI>Giles</HI> in the &s;ame Manner. The &s;imple 'Squire made a &s;udden Start to follow; but the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Quorum</HI> whipp'd between upon the Stand of the Stairs. A Maid going up with Coals made us halt, and put us into &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that we &s;tood all in a Heap, without any vi&s;ible Po&s;&s;ibility of recovering our Order: For the young Jackanapes &s;eem'd to make a Je&s;t of this Matter, and had &s;o contrived, by pre&s;&s;ing among&s;t us under Pretence of making Way, that his Grandfather was got into the Middle, and he knew no Body was of Quality to &s;tir a Step, till Sir <HI>Harry</HI> mov'd fir&s;t. We were fix'd in this Per plexity for &s;ome Time, till we heard a very loud Noi&s;e in the Street; and Sir <HI>Harry</HI> asking what it was, I, to make them more, &s;aid it was Fire. Upon this, all ran down as fa&s;t as they could, without Order or Ceremony, till we got into the Street, where we drew up in very good Order, and fil'd off down <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> the impertinent Templer driving us befo e him, as in a String, and pointing to his Acquaintance who pa&s;s'd by.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I love to u&s;e People according to their own Sen&s;e of good Breeding, and therefore whipp'd in between the Ju&s;tice and the &s;imple 'Squire. He could not properly take this ill; but I over-heard him whi&s;per the Steward, That he
<PB N="232" REF="238">
thought it hard that a common Conjurer &s;hould take Place of him, tho' an elder 'Squire. In this Order we marched down <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> at the up|per End of which I lodge. When we came to <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> Sir <HI>Harry</HI> and Sir <HI>Giles</HI> got over; but a Run of the Coaches kept the re&s;t of us on this Side the Street: However, we all at la&s;t landed, and drew up in very good Order before <HI>Ben. Tooke</HI>'s Shop, who favoured our Rallying with great Humanity. From hence we proceed|ed again, till we came to <HI>Dick</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, where I de&s;igned to carry 'em. Here we were at our old Difficulty, and took up the Street upon the &s;ame Ceremony. We proceeded through the Entry, and were &s;o nece&s;&s;arily kept in Order by the Situation, that we were now got into the Cof|fee-hou&s;e it &s;elf, where, as &s;oon as we arrived, we repeated our Civilities to each other; after which, we marched up to the high Table, which has an A&s;cent to it inclo&s;ed in the Middle of the Room. The whole Hou&s;e was alarm'd at this Entry, made up of Per&s;ons of &s;o much State and Ru&s;ticity. Sir <HI>Harry</HI> call'd for a Mug of Ale, and <HI>Dyer</HI>'s Letter. The Boy brought the Ale in an In|&s;tant; but &s;aid, they did not take in the Letter. No, (&s;ays Sir <HI>Harry!</HI>) Then take back your Mug; we are like indeed to have good Liquor at this Hou&s;e. Here the Templer tipp'd me a &s;econd Wink, and if I had not looked very grave upon him, I found he was di&s;po&s;ed to be very familiar with me. In &s;hort, I ob&s;erved after a long Pau&s;e, that the Gentlemen did not care to enter upon Bu&s;ine&s;s till after their Morning-Draught, for which Rea&s;on I called for a Bottle of Mum; and finding that had no Effect upon them, I ordered a Second, and a Third: After which, Sir <HI>Harry</HI> reached over to me, and told me in a low Voice, that the Place was too publick for Bu&s;ine&s;s; but he would call upon me again to Morrow Morning at my own Lodgings, and bring &s;ome more Friends with him.</P>

<P>Though this Place is frequented by a more mixed Company than it us'd to be formerly; yet you meet very often &s;ome whom one cannot leave without being the better for their Conver&s;ation. A Gentleman this Evening, in a dictating Manner, talked I thought very plea&s;ingly in Prai&s;e of Mo|de&s;ty, in the mid&s;t of Ten or Twelve Libertines, upon whom it &s;eemed to have had a good Effect: He repre&s;ented it as the certain Indication of a great and noble Spirit. Mode&s;ty, &s;aid he, is the Virtue which makes Men prefer the Publick to their Private Intere&s;t, the Guide of every hone&s;t Undertaking, and the great Guardian of Inno|cence: It makes Men amiable to their Friends, and re&s;pected by their very Enemies. In all Places, and on all Occa&s;ions, it attracts Benevo|lence, and demands Approbation.</P>
<P>One might give In&s;tances out of Antiquity, of the irre&s;i&s;tible Force of this Quality in great Minds: <HI>Cicereius,</HI> and <HI>Cneius Scipio</HI> the Son of the great <HI>Africanus,</HI> were Competitors for the Office of Praetor. The Crowd followed <HI>Cicereius,</HI> and left <HI>Scipio</HI> unattended. <HI>Cicereius</HI> &s;aw this with much Concern, and de&s;iring an Audience of the People, he de&s;cended from the Place where the Candi|dates were to &s;it, in the Eye of the Multitude, pleaded for his Adver&s;ary, and with an ingenuous Mode&s;ty (which it is impo&s;&s;ible to feign) repre|&s;ented to them, how much it was to their Di&s;ho|nour, that a virtuous Son of <HI>Africanus</HI> &s;hould not be preferred to him, or any other Man what&s;o|ever. This immediately gain'd the Election for <HI>Scipio;</HI> but all the Compliments and Congratula|tions upon it were made to <HI>Cicereius.</HI> It is ea&s;ier in this Ca&s;e to &s;ay who had the Office, than the Ho|nour. There is no Occurrence in Life, where this Quality is not more ornamental than any other. After the Battle of <HI>Phar&s;alia, Pompey</HI> marching towards <HI>Lari&s;&s;us,</HI> the whole People of that Place
<PB N="234" REF="240">
come out in Proce&s;&s;ion to do him Honour. He thanked the Magi&s;trates for their Re&s;pect to him; but de&s;ired them to perform the&s;e Ceremonies to the Conqueror. This gallant Submi&s;&s;ion to his Fortune, and Di&s;dain of making any Appearance but like <HI>Pompey,</HI> was owing to his Mode&s;ty, which would not permit him to be, &s;o di&s;ingenuous, as to give him&s;elf the Air of Pro&s;perity, when he was in the contrary Condition.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay of Mode&s;ty, as it is the Virtue which pre&s;erves a Decorum in the general Cour&s;e of our Life; but con&s;idering it al&s;o as it regards our meer Bodies, it is the certain Character of a great Mind. It is memorable of the mighty <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> that when he was murder'd in the Capitol, at the very Moment in which he expired, he gathe|red his Robe about him, that he might fall in a decent Po&s;ture. In this Manner (&s;ays my Au|thor) he went off, not like a Man that departed out of Life, but a Deity that returned to his Abode.</P>

<P>THere is nothing which I contemplate with greater Plea&s;ure than the Dignity of humane Nature, which often &s;hows it &s;elf in all Condi|tions of Life: For notwith&s;tanding the Degene|racy and Meanne&s;s that is crept into it, there are a Thou&s;and Occa&s;ions in which it breaks through its Original Corruption, and &s;hows what it once was, and what it will be hereafter. I con&s;ider the Soul of Man, as the Ruin of a glorious Pile of Building; where, amid&s;t great Heaps of Rub|bi&s;h,
<PB N="235" REF="241">
you meet with noble Fragments of Sculp|ture, broken Pillars and Obelisks, and a Magni|ficence in Confu&s;ion. Virtue and Wi&s;dom are continually employed in clearing the Ruins, re|moving the&s;e di&s;orderly Heaps, recovering the noble Pieces that lie buried under them, and ad|ju&s;ting them as well as po&s;&s;ible according to their ancient Symmetry and Beauty. A happy Educa|tion, Conver&s;ation with the fine&s;t Spirits, look|ing abroad into the Works of Nature, and Ob|&s;ervations upon Mankind, are the great A&s;&s;i&s;tan|ces to this nece&s;&s;ary and glorious Work. But even among tho&s;e who have never had the Hap|pine&s;s of any of the&s;e Advantages, there are &s;ometimes &s;uch Exertions of the Greatne&s;s that is natural to the Mind of Man, as &s;how Capaci|ties and Abilities, which only want the&s;e acci|dental Helps to fetch them out, and &s;how them in a proper Light. A Plebeian Soul is &s;till the Ruin of this glorious Edifice, though encumber'd with all its Rubbi&s;h. This Reflection ro&s;e in me from a Letter which my Servant drop'd as he was dre&s;&s;ing me, and which he told me was commu|nicated to him as he is an Acquaintance of &s;ome of the Per&s;ons mentioned in it. The Epi&s;tle is from one Serjeant <HI>Hall</HI> of the Foot-Guards.

</LETTER>
<P>I &s;aw the Criticks prepared to nibble at my Letter; therefore examined it my &s;elf, partly in their Way, and partly my own. This is (&s;aid I) truly a <HI>Letter,</HI> and an hone&s;t Repre&s;entation of that chearful Heart which accompanies the poor Soldier in his Warfare. Is not there in this all the Topick of &s;ubmitting to our De&s;tiny as well di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, as if a greater Man had been placed, like <HI>Brutus,</HI> in his Tent at Midnight, reflecting on all the Occurrences of pa&s;t Life, and &s;aying fine Things on Being it &s;elf? What Serjeant <HI>Hall</HI> knows of the Matter, is, that he wi&s;hes there had not been &s;o many killed, and he had him|&s;elf a very bad Shot in the Head, and &s;hould re|cover if it plea&s;ed God. But be that as it will, he takes Care, like a Man of Honour, as he cer|tainly is, to let the Widow <HI>Stephen&s;on</HI> know, that he had Seven and Threepence for her; and that if he lives, he is &s;ure he &s;hall go into Garri|&s;on at la&s;t. I doubt not but all the good Compa|ny at the <HI>Red-Lettice</HI> drank his Health with as much real E&s;teem as we do any of our Friends. All that I am concerned for, is, that Mrs. <HI>Peggy</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="244">
<HI>Hartwell</HI> may be offended at &s;howing this Letter, becau&s;e her Conduct in Mr. <HI>Hartwell</HI>'s Ab&s;ence is a little enquired into. But I could not &s;ink that Circum&s;tance, becau&s;e you Criticks would have lo&s;t one of the Parts which I doubt not but you have much to &s;ay upon, Whether the Fami|liar Way is well hit in this Style or not? As for my &s;elf, I take a very particular Satisfaction in &s;eeing any Letter that is fit only for tho&s;e to read who are concern'd in it, but e&s;pecially on &s;uch a Subject.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Heap of an Army, utterly out of all Pro&s;pect of Ri&s;ing and Preferment, as they certainly are, and &s;uch great Things exe|cuted by them, it is hard to account for the Mo|tive of their Gallantry. But to me, who was a Cadet at the Battle of <HI>Cold&s;tream</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when <HI>Monk</HI> charged at the Head of the Regi|ment, now called <HI>Cold&s;tream</HI> from the Victory of that Day; (I remember it as well as if it were Ye&s;terday) I &s;tood on the Left of old <HI>We&s;t,</HI> who I believe is now at <HI>Chel&s;ea:</HI> I &s;ay, to me, who know very well this Part of Mankind. I take the Gallantry of private Soldiers to proceed from the &s;ame, if not from a nobler Impul&s;e than that of Gentlemen and Officers. They have the &s;ame Ta&s;te of being acceptable to their Friends, and go through the Difficulties of that Profe&s;&s;ion by the &s;ame irre&s;i&s;tible Charm of Fellow&s;hip, and the Communication of Joys and Sorrows, which quickens the Reli&s;h of Plea&s;ure, and abates the Angui&s;h of Pain. Add to this, that they have the &s;ame Regard to Fame, though they do not expect &s;o great a Share as Men above them hope for; but I'll engage, Serjeant <HI>Hall</HI> would die Ten thou&s;and Deaths, rather than a Word &s;hould be &s;poken at the <HI>Red-Lettice,</HI> or any Part of the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> in Prejudice to his Courage or Ho|ne&s;ty. If you will have my Opinion then of the Serjeant's Letter, I pronounce the Style to be
<PB N="239" REF="245">
mixed, but truly Epi&s;tolary; the Sentiment re|lating to his own Wound, is in the Sublime; the Po&s;t&s;cript of <HI>Pegg Hartwell,</HI> in the gay; and the Whole, the Picture of the brave&s;t Sort of Men, that is to &s;ay, a Man of great Courage, and &s;mall Hopes.</P>

<P>When I came Home this Evening, I found, after many Attempts to vary my Thoughts, that my Head &s;till ran upon the Subject of the Di&s;|cour&s;e to Night at <HI>Will</HI>'s. I fell therefore into the Amu&s;ement of proportioning the Glory of a Battle among the whole Army, and dividing it into Shares, according to the Method of the Mil|lion-Lottery. In this Bank of Fame, by an exact Calculation, and the Rules of Political Arith|metick, I have allotted Ten hundred thou&s;and Shares; Five hundred thou&s;and of which is the Due of the General, Two hundred thou&s;and I a&s;&s;ign to the General Officers, and Two hundred thou&s;and more to all the Commi&s;&s;ioned Officers, from Colonels to En&s;igns; the remaining Hun|dred thou&s;and mu&s;t be di&s;tributed among the Non-Commi&s;&s;ion'd Officers, and private Men: According to which Computation, I find Ser|jeant <HI>Hall</HI> is to have one Share and a Fraction of two Fifths. When I was a Boy at <HI>Oxford,</HI> there was among the Antiquities near the Theatre a great Stone, on which were engraven the Names of all who fell in the Battle of <HI>Marathon.</HI> The generous and knowing People of <HI>Athens</HI> under|&s;tood the Force of the De&s;ire of Glory, and would not let the meane&s;t Soldier peri&s;h in Obli|vion.

<OPENER><DATELINE>White's Chocolate-hou&s;e, <DATE>October 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately received a Letter from a Friend in the Country, wherein he acquaints me, That two or three Men of the Town are got a|mong them, and have brought down particular Words and Phra&s;es, which were never before in tho&s;e Parts. He mentions in particular the Words <HI>Gunner</HI> and <HI>Gun&s;ter,</HI> which my Corre&s;pon|dent ob&s;erves they make u&s;e of when any Thing has been related that is &s;trange and &s;urprizing; and therefore de&s;ires I would explain tho&s;e Terms, as I have many others, for the Information of &s;uch as live at a Di&s;tance from this Town and Court, which he calls the great Mints of Lan|guage. His Letter is dated from <HI>York;</HI> and (if he tells me Truth) a Word in its ordinary Circu|lation does not reach that City within the Space of Five Years after it is fir&s;t &s;tamp'd. I cannot &s;ay how long the&s;e Words have been current in Town, but I &s;hall now take Care to &s;end them down by the next Po&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t Place ob&s;erve, That the Words <HI>Gunner</HI> and <HI>Gun&s;ter</HI> are not to be u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly; for a Gunner, properly &s;peaking, is not a Gun&s;ter: Nor is a Gun&s;ter, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> a Gunner. They both indeed are derived from the Word Gun, and &s;o far they agree. But as a Gun is remarkable for its de&s;troying at a Di|&s;tance, or for the Report it makes, which is apt to &s;tartle all its Hearers, tho&s;e who recount &s;trange Accidents and Circum&s;tances, which have no Manner of Foundation in Truth, when
<PB N="241" REF="247">
they de&s;ign to do Mi&s;chief, are comprehended under the Appellation of Gunners; but when they endeavour only to &s;urpri&s;e and entertain, they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of Gun&s;ters. Gun|ners therefore are the Pe&s;t of Society; but the Gun&s;ters often the Diver&s;ion. The Gunner is de|&s;tructive, and hated; the Gun&s;ter innocent, and laughed at. The fir&s;t is prejudicial to others, the other only to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, I mu&s;t in the next Place &s;ubdivide the Gunner into &s;everal Branches: All or the Chief of which are I think as follow:
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Bombardeer.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Miner.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Squib.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Serpent.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of the Fir&s;t. The Bombardeer to&s;&s;es his Balls &s;ometimes into the mid&s;t of a City, with a De&s;ign to fill all around him with Terror and Combu&s;tion. He has been &s;ometimes known to drop a Bomb in a Senate-hou&s;e, and to &s;catter a Pannick over a Nation. But his chief Aim is at &s;everal eminent Stations, which he looks upon as the faire&s;t Marks, and u&s;es all his Skill to do Execution upon tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them. Every Man &s;o &s;ituated, let his Merit be never &s;o great, is &s;ure to undergo a Bombardment. It is further ob&s;erved, that the only Way to be out of Danger from the Bur&s;ting of a Bomb, is to lie pro&s;trate on the Ground; a Po&s;ture too abject for generous Spirits.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Miner.</P>
<P>As the Bombardeer levels his Mi&s;chief at Na|tions and Cities, the Miner bu&s;ies him&s;elf in ruining and overturning private Hou&s;es and parti|cular Per&s;ons. He often acts as a Spy, in di&s;co|vering the &s;ecret Avenues and unguarded Ac|ce&s;&s;es
<PB N="242" REF="248">
of Families, where, after he has made his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">roper Di&s;coveries and Di&s;po&s;itions, he &s;ets &s;udden Fire to his Train, that blows up Families, &s;catters Friends, &s;eparates Lovers, di&s;per&s;es Kindred, and &s;hakes a whole Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, that &s;everal Females are great Proficients in this Way of Engineering. The Marks by which they are to be known, are a wonderful Sollicitude for the Reputation of their Friends, and a more than ordinary Concern for the Good of their Neighbours. There is al&s;o in them &s;omething &s;o very like Religion, as may deceive the Vulgar; but if you look upon it more nearly, you &s;ee on it &s;uch a Ca&s;t of Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s, as di&s;covers it to be nothing but Hypocri&s;y. <HI>Cleomilla</HI> is a great In&s;tance of a Female Miner: But as my De&s;ign is to expo&s;e only the Incorrigi|ble, let her be &s;ilent for the future, and I &s;hall be &s;o too.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Squib.</P>
<P>The Squibs are tho&s;e who in the common Phra&s;e of the World are called Libellers, Lampooners, and Pamphleteers. Their Fire-works are made up in Paper; and it is ob&s;erved, that they mix abundance of Charcoal in their Powder, that they may be &s;ure to blacken where they cannot finge. The&s;e are ob&s;erved to give a Con&s;terna|tion and Di&s;turbance only to weak Minds; which, according to the Proverb, are always <HI>more afraid than hurt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Serpents.</P>
<P>The Serpents are a petty Kind of Gunners, more pernicious than any of the re&s;t. They make U&s;e of a Sort of a White Powder, that goes off without any violent Crack, but gives a gentle Sound, much like that of a Whi&s;per; and is more de&s;tructive in all Parts of Life, than any of the Materials made U&s;e of by any of the Fra+ternity.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="249">
Come we now to the <HI>Gun&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>This Race of Engineers deals altogether in Wind-Guns, which by recoiling often, knock down tho&s;e who di&s;charge them, without hurt|ing any Body el&s;e; and according to the various Compre&s;&s;ions of the Air, make &s;uch &s;trange Squeaks, Cracks, Pops, and Bounces, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to hear without Laughing. 'Tis ob|&s;ervable however, that there is a Di&s;po&s;ition in a Gun&s;ter to become a Gunner; and though their proper In&s;truments are only loaden with Wind, they often, out of Wantonne&s;s, fire a Bomb, or &s;pring a Mine, out of their natural Inclination to Engineering; by which Means they do Mi&s;chief when they don't de&s;ign it, and have their Bones broken when they don't de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>This Sort of Engineers are the mo&s;t unaccoun|table Race of Men in the World: Some of them have received above an Hundred Wounds, and yet have not a Scar in their Bodies: &s;ome have debauched Multitudes of Women who have died Maids. You may be with them from Morning till Night, and the next Day they &s;hall tell you a Thou&s;and Adventures that happened when you were with them, which you know nothing of. They have a Quality of having been pre&s;ent at every Thing they hear related; and never heard a Man commended, who was not their intimate Acquaintance, if not their Kin&s;man.</P>
<P>I hope the&s;e Notes may &s;erve as a rough Draught for a new E&s;tabli&s;hment of Engineers, which I &s;hall hereafter fill up with proper Per|&s;ons, according to my own Ob&s;ervations on their Conduct, having already had one recommended to me for the General of my Artillery. But that, and all the other Po&s;ts, I intend to keep open, till I can inform my &s;elf of the Candidates, having re&s;olved in this Ca&s;e to depend no more upon their Friend's Word, than I would upon their own.</P>

<P>I was this Morning awaked by a &s;udden Skake of the Hou&s;e; and as &s;oon as I had got a little out of my Con&s;ternation, I felt another, which was followed by Two or Three Repetitions of the &s;ame Convul&s;ion. I got up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, girt on my Rapier, and &s;natch'd up my Hat, when my Landlady came up to me, and told me, That the Gentlewoman of the next Hou&s;e begged me to &s;tep thither; for that a Lodger &s;he had taken in was run mad, and &s;he de|&s;ired my Advice; as indeed every Body in the whole Lane does upon important Occa&s;ions. I am not like &s;ome Arti&s;ts, &s;awcy, becau&s;e I can be beneficial, but went immediately. Our Neighbour told us, &s;he had the Day before let her Second Floor to a very genteel youngi&s;h Man, who told her, he kept extraordinary good Hours, and was generally at Home mo&s;t Part of the Morning and Evening at Study; but that this Morning he had for an Hour together made this extravagant Noi&s;e which we then heard. I went up Stairs with my Hand upon the Hilt of my Rapier, and approached this new Lodger's Door. I look'd in at the Key|hole, and there I &s;aw a well-made Man look with great Attention on a Book, and on a &s;ud|den jump into the Air &s;o high, that his Head almo&s;t touched the Cieling. He came down &s;afe on his Right Foot, and again flew up a|lighting on his Left; then looked again at his Book, and holding out his Right Leg, put it into &s;uch a quivering Motion, that I thought he would have &s;haked it off. He u&s;ed the Left after the &s;ame Manner, when on a &s;udden, to my great Surprize, he &s;tooped him&s;elf incredibly low, and turned gently on his Toes. After this circular Motion, he continued bent in that humble Po&s;ture for &s;ome Time, looking on his Book. After this, he recovered him&s;elf with a
<PB N="245" REF="251">
&s;udden Spring, and flew round the Room in all the Violence and Di&s;order imaginable, till he made a full Pau&s;e for Want of Breath. In this Interim my Women asked what I thought: I whi&s;per'd, that I thought this learned Per&s;on an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, who po&s;&s;ibly had his fir&s;t Education in the Peripatetick Way, which was a Sect of Philo&s;ophers who always &s;tudied when walking. But ob&s;erving him much out of Breath, I thought it the be&s;t Time to ma&s;ter him if he were di&s;or|der'd, and knock'd at his Door. I was &s;urpriz'd to find him open it, and &s;ay with great Civility and good Mien, That he hoped he had not di&s;turbed us. I believed him in a lucid Inter|val, and de&s;ired he'd plea&s;e to let me &s;ee his Book. He did &s;o, &s;miling. I could not make any Thing of it, and therefore asked in what Language it was writ.

<P>THAT the Country is barren of News, has been the Excu&s;e Time out of Mind for dropping a Corre&s;pondence with our Friends in <HI>London;</HI> as if it were impo&s;&s;ible out of a Coffee-hou&s;e to write an agreeable Letter. I am too ingenuous to endeavour at the covering of my Negligence with &s;o common an Excu&s;e. Doubtle&s;s, amongst Friends bred as we

I pro|mi&s;e therefore to be frequent for the future in my rural Dates to you: But for fear you &s;hould, from what I have &s;aid, be induced to believe I &s;hun the Commerce of Men, I mu&s;t inform you, That there is a fre&s;h Topick of Di&s;cour&s;e lately ri&s;en among&s;t the Ingenious in our Part of the World, and is be|come the more fa&s;hionable for the Ladies giving into it.

<P>There is no Plea&s;ure like that of receiving Prai&s;e from the Prai&s;e-worthy; and I own it a very &s;olid Happine&s;s, that the&s;e my Lucubrations are approved by a Per&s;on of &s;o fine a Ta&s;t as the Author of this Letter, who is capable of enjoy|ing the World in the Simplicity of its natural Beauties. This Pa&s;toral Letter, if I may &s;o call it, mu&s;t be written by a Man who carries his Entertainment wherever he goes, and is undoubt|edly one of tho&s;e happy Men who appear far o|therwi&s;e to the Vulgar. I dare &s;ay, he is not envied by the Vicious, the Vain, the Frolick, and the Loud; but is continually ble&s;&s;ed with that &s;trong and &s;erious Delight which flows from a well-taught and liberal Mind. With great Re|&s;pect
<PB N="248" REF="254">
to Country Sports, I may &s;ay, this Gentle|man could pa&s;s his Time agreeably, if there were not a Hare or a Fox in his County. That calm and elegant Satisfaction which the Vulgar call Melancholy, is the true and proper Delight of Men of Knowledge and Virtue. What we take for Diver&s;ion, which is a kind of forgetting our &s;elves, is but a mean Way of Entertainment, in Compari&s;on of that which is con&s;idering, knowing, and enjoying our &s;elves. The Plea|&s;ures of ordinary People are in their Pa&s;&s;ions; but the Seat of this Delight is in the Rea&s;on and Un|der&s;tanding. Such a Frame of Mind rai&s;es that &s;weet Enthu&s;ia&s;m which warms the Imagination at the Sight of every Work of Nature, and turns all around you into Picture and Landskip. I &s;hall be ever proud of Advices from this Gentle|man; for I profe&s;s writing News from the lear|ned as well as the bu&s;ie World.</P>
<P>As for my Labours, which he is plea&s;ed to en|quire after, if they can but wear one Imperti|nence out of humane Life, de&s;troy a &s;ingle Vice, or give a Morning's Chearfulne&s;s to an hone&s;t Mind; in &s;hort, if the World can be but one Virtue the better, or in any Degree le&s;s vicious, or receive from them the &s;malle&s;t Addition to their innocent Diver&s;ions, I &s;hall not think my Pains, or indeed my Life, to have been &s;pent in vain.</P>
<P>Thus far as to my Studies. It will be expected I &s;hould in the next Place give &s;ome Account of my Life. I &s;hall therefore, for the Satisfaction of the pre&s;ent Age, and the Benefit of Po&s;terity, pre&s;ent the World with the following Abridgment of it.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that I was bred by Hand, and eat nothing but Milk till I was a Twelve|month old; from which Time, to the 8th Year of my Age, I was ob&s;erved to delight in Pud|ding
<PB N="249" REF="255">
and Potatoes; and indeed I retain a Bene|volence for that Sort of Food to this Day. I do not remember that I di&s;tingui&s;h'd my &s;elf in any Thing at tho&s;e Years, but by my great Skill at Taw, for which I was &s;o barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed, that it has ever &s;ince given me an Aver&s;ion to Ga|ming. In my Twelfth Year, I &s;uffered very much for Two or Three fal&s;e Concords. At Fifteen, I was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, and &s;tayed there for &s;ome Time; but a Drum pa&s;&s;ing by, (being a Lover of Mu&s;ick) I li&s;ted my &s;elf for a Soldier. As Years came on, I began to examine Things, and grew di&s;contented at the Times. This made me quit the Sword, and take to the Study of the Occult Sciences, in which I was &s;o wrap'd up, that <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> had been bu|ried, and taken up again, Five Years before I heard he was dead. This gave me fir&s;t the Re|putation of a Conjurer, which has been of great Di&s;advantage to me ever &s;ince, and kept me out of all Publick Employments. The greater Part of my later Years has been divided between <HI>Dick</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, the <HI>Trumpet</HI> in <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> and my own Lodgings.</P>

<P>I was very well plea&s;ed this Evening, to hear a Gentleman expre&s;s a very becoming Indigna|tion again&s;t a Practice which I my &s;elf have been very much offended at. There is nothing (&s;aid he) more ridiculous, than for an Actor to in&s;ert Words of his own in the Part he is to act, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the Poet for the Player: You'l have <HI>Penkethman</HI> and <HI>Bullock</HI> helping out <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fietcher.</HI> It puts me in Mind (con|tinued he) of a Collection of antique Statues which I once &s;aw in a Gentleman's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,

who employ'd a neighbouring Stone-Cutter to add No&s;es, Ears, Arms, or Legs, to the maimed Works of <HI>Phidias</HI> or <HI>Praxiteles.</HI> You may be &s;ure this Addition disfigured the Statues much more than Time had. I remember a <HI>Venus,</HI> that by the No&s;e he had given her, looked like Mo|ther <HI>Shipton;</HI> and a <HI>Mercury,</HI> with a Pair of Legs that &s;eemed very much &s;welled with a Drop&s;y.</P>
<P>I thought the Gentleman's Ob&s;ervations very proper; and he told me, I had improved his Thought, in mentioning on this Occa&s;ion tho&s;e wi&s;e Commentators who had filled up the Hemi|&s;ticks of <HI>Virgil;</HI> particularly that notable Poet, who, to make the <HI>Aeneid</HI> more perfect, carried on the Story to <HI>Lavinia</HI>'s Wedding.

<P>THE Pa&s;&s;ion of Love happened to be the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e between Two or Three of us at the Table of the Poets this Even|ing; and among other Ob&s;ervations, it was re|marked, that the &s;ame Sentiment on this Pa&s;&s;ion had run through all Languages and Nations. <HI>Menmius,</HI> who has a very good Ta&s;te, fell into a little Sort of Di&s;&s;ertation on this Occa&s;ion. It is (&s;aid he) remarkable, that no Pa&s;&s;ion has been
<PB N="252" REF="258">
treated by all who have touch'd upon it with the &s;ame Bent of De&s;ign but this. The Poets, the Morali&s;ts, the Painters, in all their De&s;criptions, Allegories, and Pictures, have repre&s;ented it as a &s;oft Torment, a bitter Sweet, a plea&s;ing Pain, or an agreeable Di&s;tre&s;s, and have only expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame Thought in a different Manner.</P>
<P>The joining of Plea&s;ure and Pain together in &s;uch Devices, &s;eems to me the only pointed Thought I ever read which is natural; and it mu&s;t have proceeded from its being the univer&s;al Sen&s;e and Experience of Mankind, that they have all &s;poken of it in the &s;ame Manner. I have in my own Reading remarked an Hundred and Three Epigrams, Fifty Odes, and Ninety one Sentences, tending to this &s;ole Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain, there is no other Pa&s;&s;ion which does produce &s;uch contrary Effects in &s;o great a Degree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> But this may be &s;aid for Love, that if you &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ve out of the Soul, Life would be in&s;ipid, and our Being but half animated. Humane Na|ture would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nk into Deadne&s;s and Lethargy, it not quickned with &s;ome active Principle; and as for all others, whether Ambition, Envy, or Ava|rice, which are apt to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Mind in the Ab|&s;ence or this Pa&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be allowed that they have greater Pains, without the Compen&s;a|tion of &s;uch exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ures as tho&s;e we find in Love. The great Skill is to heighten the Sa|tisfactions, and deaden the Sorrows of it, which has been the End of many of my Labours, and &s;hall continue to be &s;o for the Service of the World in general, and in Particular of the Fair Sex, who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> always the be&s;t or the wor&s;t Part of it. It is pity that a Pa&s;&s;ion, which has in it a Ca|pacity of making Life happy, &s;hould not be cul|tivated to the utmo&s;t Advantage. Rea&s;on, Pru|dence, and good Nature, rightly applied, can throughly accompli&s;h this great End, provided they have always a real and con&s;tant Love to
<PB N="253" REF="259">
work upon. But this Subject I &s;hall treat more at large in the Hi&s;tory of my married Si&s;ter; and in the mean Time, &s;hall conclude my Reflection on the Pains and Plea&s;ures which attend this Pa&s;&s;ion with one of the fine&s;t Allegories which I think I have ever read. It is invented by the Divine <HI>Plato,</HI> and to &s;hew the Opinion he him|&s;elf had of it, a&s;cribed by him to his admir'd <HI>So|crates,</HI> whom he repre&s;ents as di&s;cour&s;ing with his Friends, and giving the Hi&s;tory of Love in the following Manner:</P>
<P>At the Birth of <HI>Beauty</HI> (&s;ays he) there was a great Fea&s;t made, and many Gue&s;ts invited: A|mong the re&s;t, was the God <HI>Plenty,</HI> who was the Son of the Godde&s;s <HI>Prudence,</HI> and inherited ma|ny of his Mother's Virtues. After a full Enter|tainment. he retired into the Garden of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which was hung with a great Variety of Ambro|&s;ial Fruits, and &s;eems to have been a very proper Retreat for &s;uch a Gue&s;t. In the mean Time an unhappy Female, called <HI>Poverty,</HI> having heard of this great Fea&s;t, repaired to it in Hopes of finding Relief. The fir&s;t Place &s;he lights upon was <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Garden, which generally &s;tands open to People of all Conditions. <HI>Poverty</HI> en|ters, and by Chance finds the God <HI>Plenty</HI> a&s;leep in it. She was immediately fired with his Charms, laid her &s;elf down by his Side, and managed Matters &s;o well, that &s;he conceived a Child by him. The World was very much in Su&s;pence upon the Occa&s;ion, and could not ima|gine to them&s;elves what would be the Nature of an Infant that was to have its Original from Two &s;uch Parents. At the la&s;t, the Child appears; and who &s;hould it be but <HI>Love.</HI> This Infant grew up, and proved in all his Behaviour what he really was, a Compound of oppo&s;ite Beings. As he is the Son of <HI>Plenty,</HI> (who was the Offspring of <HI>Prudence</HI>) he is &s;ubtle, intriguing, full of Strata|gems and Devices; as the Son of <HI>Poverty,</HI> he is
<PB N="254" REF="260">
fawning, begging, &s;erenading, delighting to lie at a Thre&s;hold, or beneath a Window. By the Father, he is audacious, full of Hopes, con&s;cious of Merit, and therefore quick of Re&s;entment: By the Mother, he his doubtful, timorous, mean|&s;pirited, fearful of offending, and abject in Sub|mi&s;&s;ions. In the &s;ame Hour you may &s;ee him tran&s;ported with Raptures, talking of immortal Plea&s;ures, and appearing &s;atisfied as a God; and immediately after, as the mortal Mother prevails in his Compo&s;ition, you behold him pining, lan|gui&s;hing, de&s;pairing, dying.</P>
<P>I have been always wonderfully delighted with Fables, Allegories, and the like Inventions, which the polite&s;t and the be&s;t In&s;tructors of Mankind have always made U&s;e of: They take off from the Severity of In&s;truction, and enforce it at the &s;ame Time that they conceal it. The &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Love</HI> to be conceived immediately after the Birth of <HI>Beauty,</HI> the Parentage of <HI>Plenty,</HI> and the In|con&s;i&s;tency of this Pa&s;&s;ion with its &s;elf &s;o natu|rally derived to it, are great Ma&s;ter-Strokes in this Fable; and if they fell into good Hands, might furni&s;h out a more plea&s;ing Canto than any in <HI>Spencer.</HI></P>

<P>I came Home this Evening in a very pen&s;ive Mood; and to divert me, took up a Volume of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> where I chanced to ca&s;t my Eye up|on a Part in the Tragedy of <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> which filled my Mind with a very agreeable Hor|ror. It was the Scene in which that bold, but wicked Prince, is repre&s;ented as &s;leeping in his Tent, the Night before the Battle in which he fell. The Poet takes that Occa&s;ion to &s;et be|fore him in a Vi&s;ion, a terrible A&s;&s;embly of Appa|ritions, the Gho&s;ts of all tho&s;e innocent Per&s;ons whom he is &s;aid to have murther'd.

<PB N="255" REF="261">
young Princes Sons to <HI>Edward</HI> IV. his own Wife, and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> ri&s;e up in their Blood before him, beginning their Speeches with that dreadful Salutation, <HI>Let me &s;it heavy on thy Soul to Morrow;</HI> and concluding with that di&s;mal Sentence, <HI>De&s;pair and die.</HI> This in&s;pires the Ty|rant with a Dream of his pa&s;t Guilt, and of the approaching Vengeance. He anticipates the fa|tal Day of <HI>Bo&s;worth,</HI> fancies him&s;elf di&s;mounted, weltring in his own Blood; and in the Agonies of De&s;pair, (before he is throughly awake) &s;tarts up with the following Speech:</P>
<Q><L>Give me another Hor&s;e&mdash;Bind up my Wounds!</L>
<L>Have Mercy Je&s;u&mdash;Soft; I did but dream.</L>
<L>Oh Coward Con&s;cience! How do&s;t thou afflict me?</L>
<L>The Lights burn blue! Is it not dead Midnight?</L>
<L>Cold fearful Drops &s;tand on my trembling Fle&s;h;</L>
<L>What do I fear? My &s;elf! <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>A Scene written with &s;o great Strength of Ima|gination, indi&s;po&s;ed me from further reading, and threw me into a deep Contemplation. I be|gan to reflect upon the different Ends of good and bad Kings; and as this was the Birth-Day of our late Renouned Monarch, I could not forbear thinking on the Departure of that excellent Prince, who&s;e Life was crowned with Glory, and his Death with Peace. I let my Mind go &s;o fat into this Thought, as to imagine to my &s;elf, what might have been the Vi&s;ion of his departing Slumbers. He might have &s;een Confederate Kings applauding him in different Languages, Slaves that had been bound in Fetters, lifting up their Hands and ble&s;&s;ing him, and the Per&s;ecuted in their &s;everal Forms of Wor&s;hip imploring Comfort on his la&s;t Moments. The Reflection upon this excellent Prince's Mortality had been a very melancholy Entertainment to me, had I not been relieved by the Con&s;ideration of the glori|ous Reign which &s;ucceeds it.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="262">
We now &s;ee as great a Virtue as ever was on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, &s;urrounded with all the Beau|ty of Succe&s;s.

<P>Madam, &s;aid I, I am confident you have not &s;tated your Ca&s;e with Sincerity, and that there is &s;ome &s;ecret Pang which you have concealed from me: For I &s;ee by your A&s;pect the Genero&s;ity of your Mind; and that open ingenuous Air lets me know, that you have too great a Sen&s;e of the ge|nerous Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, to prefer the O&s;tentation of Life in the Arms of <HI>Cra&s;&s;us,</HI> to the Entertain|ments and Conveniencies of it in the Company of your beloved <HI>Lorio;</HI> for &s;o he is indeed Madam. You &s;peak his Name with a different Accent from the re&s;t of your Di&s;cour&s;e: The Idea his Image rai&s;es in you, gives new Life to your Fea|tures, and new Grace to your Speech. Nay, blu&s;h not, Madam, there is no Di&s;honour in lo|ving a Man of Merit; I a&s;&s;ure you, I am grieved at this dallying with your &s;elf, when you put another in Competition with him, for no other Rea&s;on but &s;uperior Wealth. <Q REND="inline">'To tell you then (&s;aid &s;he) the Bottom of my Heart, there's <HI>Clo|tilda</HI> lies by, and plants her &s;elf in the Way of <HI>Cra&s;&s;us,</HI> and I am confident will &s;nap him, if I re|fu&s;e

him. I cannot bear to think that &s;he will &s;hine above me. When our Coaches meet, to &s;ee her Chariot hung behind with Four Footmen, and mine with but Two: Hers, powder'd, gay, and &s;awcy, kept only for Show; mine, a Cou|ple of careful Rogues that are good for &s;ome|thing: I own, I cannot bear that <HI>Clotilda</HI> &s;hould be in all the Pride and Wantonne&s;s of Wealth, and I only in the Ea&s;e and Affluence of it.'</Q></P>
<P>Here I interrupted: Well, Madam, now I &s;ee your whole Affliction; you could be happy, but that you fear another would be happier: Or rather, you could be &s;olidly happy, but that another is to be happy in Appearance. This is an Evil which you mu&s;t get over, or never know Happine&s;s. We will put the Ca&s;e, Madam, that you married <HI>Cra&s;|&s;us,</HI> and &s;he <HI>Lorio.</HI> She an&s;wer'd, Speak not of it&mdash;I could tear her Eyes out at the Mention of it. Well then, I pronounce <HI>Lorio</HI> to be the Man; but I mu&s;t tell you, that what we call Settling in the World, is in a Kind leaving it; and you mu&s;t at once re&s;olve to keep your Thoughts of Happi|ne&s;s within the Reach of your Fortune, and not mea&s;ure it by Compari&s;on with others.</P>
<P>But indeed, Madam, when I behold that beau|teous Form of yours, and con&s;ider the Generali|ty of your Sex, as to their Di&s;po&s;al of them&s;elves in Marriage, or their Parents doing it for them without their own Approbation, I cannot but look upon all &s;uch Matches as the mo&s;t impudent Pro|&s;titutions. Do but ob&s;erve when you are at a Play, the familiar Wenches that &s;it laughing a|mong the Men. The&s;e appear dete&s;table to you in the Boxes: Each of them would give up her Per&s;on for a Guinea; and &s;ome of you would take the wor&s;t there for Life for Twenty Thou|&s;and. If &s;o, How do you differ but in Price? As to the Circum&s;tance of Marriage, I take that to be hardly an Alteration of the Ca&s;e; for Wed|lock is but a more &s;olemn Pro&s;titution, where
<PB N="259" REF="265">
there is not an Union of Minds. You would hardly believe it, but there have been De&s;igns even upon me.</P>
<P>A Neighbour in this very Lane, who knows I have, by leading a very wary Life, laid up a little Money, had a great Mind to marry me tohis Daugh|ter. I was frequently invited to their Table: The Girl was always very plea&s;ant and agreeable. After Dinner, Mi&s;s <HI>Molly</HI> would be &s;ure to fill my Pipe for me, and put more Sugar than ordinary into my Coffee; for &s;he was &s;ure I was good-natured&mdash;If I chanced to hem, the Mother would applaud my Vigour; and has often &s;aid on that Occa&s;ion, I wonder, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you don't marry, I am &s;ure you would have Children. Things went &s;o far, that my Mi&s;tre&s;s pre&s;ented me with a Wrought Nightcap and a Laced Band of her own Working. I began to think of it in earne&s;t; but one Day, having an Occa&s;ion to ride to <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> as Two or Three People were lifting me upon my Pad, I &s;pied her at a convenient Di&s;tance laughing at her Lover, with a Parcel of Romps of her Acquain|tance: One of them, who I &s;uppo&s;e had the &s;ame De&s;ign upon me, told me &s;he &s;aid, Do you &s;ee how briskly my old Gentleman mounts? This made me cut off my Amour, and to reflect with my &s;elf, that no married Life could be &s;o unhappy, as where the Wife propo&s;es no other Advantage from her Husband, than that of making her &s;elf fine, and keeping her out of the Dirt.</P>
<P>My fair Client bur&s;t out a laughing at the Ac|count I gave her of my E&s;cape, and went away &s;eemingly convinced of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of my Di&s;cour&s;e to her.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as &s;he was gone, my Maid brought up the following Epi&s;tle, which by the Style, and the De&s;cription &s;he gave of the Per&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e was left by <HI>Nick Doubt.</HI> Harkee, &s;aid he, Girl, tell old <HI>Basket-hilt,</HI> I would have him an&s;wer it by the fir&s;t Opportunity. What he &s;ays, is this:</P>

<P>YOU &s;eem a very hone&s;t Fellow; therefore pray tell me, Did not you write that Letter in Prai&s;e of the 'Squire and his Lucubrations your &s;elf? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>The greate&s;t Plague of Coxcombs is, that they often break upon you with an impertinent Piece of good Sen&s;e, as this Jackanapes has hit me in a right Place enough. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am as likely to play &s;uch a Trick as another; but that Letter he &s;peaks of was really genuine. When I fir&s;t &s;et up, I thought it fair enough to let my &s;elf know from all Parts, that my Works were wonderfully enquired for, and were become the Diver&s;ion, as well as In&s;truction, of all the choice Spirits in every County of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I do not doubt but the more Intelligent of my Readers found it, before this <HI>Jackanapes</HI> (I can call him no bet|ter) took upon him to ob&s;erve upon my Style and my Basket-hilt. A very plea&s;ant Gentleman of my Acquaintance told me one Day a Story of this Kind of Fal&s;hood and Vanity in an Author.</P>
<P><HI>Maevius</HI> &s;howed him a Paper of Ver&s;es, which he &s;aid he had received that Morning by the Penny-Po&s;t from an unknown Hand. My Friend admired them extremely. Sir, &s;aid he, this mu&s;t come from a Man that's eminent: You &s;ee Fire, Life and Spirit, run through the Whole, and at the &s;ame time a Correctne&s;s, which &s;hows he is u&s;ed to Writing, Pray, Sir, read them over again. He begins again, Title and all; <HI>To</HI> Mae|vius, <HI>on his Incomparable Poems.</HI> The &s;econd Reading was performed with much more Vehe|mence and Action than the former; after which my Friend fell into downright Raptures&mdash;Why, they are truly &s;ublime! There is Energy in this Line! De&s;cription in that! Why, 'tis the Thing it &s;elf! This is perfect Picture! <HI>Maevius</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="267">
could bear no more; but, Faith &s;ays he, <HI>Ned,</HI> to tell you the plain Truth, I writ them my &s;elf.</P>
<P>There goes ju&s;t &s;uch another Story of the &s;ame paternal Tenderne&s;s in <HI>Bavius,</HI> an ingenious Con|temporary of mine, who had writ &s;everal Come|dies, which were rejected by the Players. This my Friend <HI>Bavius</HI> took for Envy, and therefore prevailed upon a Gentleman to go with him to the Play-hou&s;e, and gave him a new Play of his, de&s;iring he would per&s;onate the Author, and read it, to baffle the Spite of the Actors. The Friend con&s;ented, and to reading they went. They had not gone over Three Similies, before <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> the Player made the Acting-Author &s;top, and de&s;ired to know, What he meant by &s;uch a Rapture? And how it came to pa&s;s, that in this Condition of the Lover, in&s;tead of acting according to his Circum&s;tances, he &s;pent his Time in con&s;idering what his pre&s;ent State was like? That is very true, &s;ays the Mock-Author, I believe we had as good &s;trike the&s;e Lines out. By your Leave, &s;ays <HI>Maevius,</HI> you &s;hall not &s;poil your Play, you are too mode&s;t; tho&s;e very Lines, for ought I know, are as good as any in your Play, and they &s;hall &s;tand. Well, they go on, and the Particle <HI>and</HI> &s;tood unfortunately at the End of a Ver&s;e, and was made to rhime to the Word <HI>&s;tand.</HI> This <HI>Ro&s;|cius</HI> excepted again&s;t. The new Poet gave up that too, and &s;aid, he would not di&s;pute for a Mono&s;yllable&mdash;For a Mono&s;yllable, &s;ays the real Author! I can a&s;&s;ure you, a Mono&s;yllable may be of as great Force as a Word of Ten Syllables. I tell you, Sir, <HI>and</HI> is the Connexion of the Matter in that Place; without that Word, you may put all that follows into any other Play as well as this. Be&s;ides, if you leave it out, it will look as if you had put it in only for the Sake of the Rhime. <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> per&s;i&s;ted, a&s;&s;uring the Gentle|man, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak it but the <HI>and</HI> mu&s;t be lo&s;t; &s;o it might as well be blotted

<P>I Know no Manner of Speaking &s;o offen&s;ive as that of giving Prai&s;e, and clo&s;ing it with an Exception; which proceeds (where Men do not do it to introduce Malice, and make Calumny more effectual) from the common Error of con&s;i|dering Man as a perfect Creature. But if we rightly examine Things, we &s;hall find, that there is a Sort of Oeconomy in Providence, that one &s;hall excel where another is defective, in order to make Men more u&s;eful to each other, and mix them in Society. This Man having this Talent, and that Man another, is as nece&s;&s;ary in Conver|&s;ation, as one profe&s;&s;ing one Trade, and another another, is beneficial in Commerce. The happi|e&s;t Climate does not produce all Things; and it was &s;o ordered that one Part of the Earth &s;hould want the Product of another, for uniting Man|kind in a general Corre&s;pondence and good Un|der&s;tanding. It is therefore Want of good Sen&s;e as well as good Nature, to &s;ay, <HI>simplicius</HI> has a

better Judgment, but not &s;o much Wit as <HI>La|tius;</HI> for that the&s;e have not each other's Capaci|ties, is no more a Diminution to either, than if you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Simplicius</HI> is not <HI>Latius,</HI> or <HI>Latius</HI> not <HI>Simplicius.</HI> The Heathen World had &s;o little Notion that Perfection was to be expected among&s;t Men, that among them any one Quality or En|dowment in an Heroick Degree made a God. <HI>Hercules</HI> had Strength; but it was never objected to him that he wanted Wit. <HI>apollo</HI> pre&s;ided over Wit, and it was never asked whether he had Strength. We hear no Exceptions again&s;t the Beauty of <HI>Minerva,</HI> or the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Venus.</HI> The&s;e wi&s;e Heathens were glad to immortalize any one &s;erviceable Gift, and overlook all Imper|fections in the Per&s;on who had it: But with us it is far otherwi&s;e, for we reject many eminent Virtues, if they are accompanied with one appa|rent Weakne&s;s. The reflecting after this Man|ner, made me account for the &s;trange Delight Men take in reading Lampoons and Scandal, with which the Age abounds, and of which I receive frequent Complaints. Upon mature Con&s;idera|tion, I find it is principally for this Rea&s;on, that the wor&s;t of Mankind, the Libellers, receive &s;o much Encouragement in the World. The low Race of Men take a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure in finding an eminent Character levelled to their Condition by a Report of its Defects, and keep them&s;elves in Countenance, though they are excelled in a thou|&s;and Virtues, if they believe they have in com|mon with a great Per&s;on any one Fault. The Libeller falls in with this Humour, and gratifies this Ba&s;ene&s;s of Temper, which is naturally an Enemy to extraordinary Merit. It is from this, that Libel and Satyr are promi&s;cuou&s;ly joined to|gether in the Notions of the Valgar, though the Satyri&s;t and Libeller differ as much as the Magi|&s;trate and the Murderer. In the Con&s;ideration of Humane Life, the Satyri&s;t never falls upon Per|&s;ons
<PB N="264" REF="270">
who are not glaringly faulty, and the Libel|ler on none but who are con&s;picuou&s;ly commen|dable. Were I to expo&s;e any Vice in a good or great Man, it &s;hould certainly be by correcting it in &s;ome one where that Crime was the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Part of the Character; as Pages are cha&s;tized for the Admonition of Princes. When it is performed otherwi&s;e, the Vicious are kept in Credit, by placing Men of Merit in the &s;ame Accu&s;ation. But all the Pa&s;quils, Lam|poons and Libels, we meet with now-a-days, are a Sort of playing with the Four and twenty Letters, and throwing them into Names and Characters, without Sen&s;e, Truth or Wit. In this Ca&s;e, I am in great Perplexity to know whom they mean, and &s;hould be in Di&s;tre&s;s for tho&s;e they abu&s;e, if I did not &s;ee their Judgment and Ingenuity in tho&s;e they commend. This is the true Way of examining a Libel; and when Men con&s;ider, that no one Man living thinks the bet|ter of their Heroes and Patrons for the Panegy|rick given 'em, none can think them&s;elves le&s;|&s;en'd by their Invective. The Hero or Patron in a Libel, is but a Scavenger to carry off the Dirt, and by that very Employment is the filthie&s;t Creature in the Street. Dedications and Panegy|ricks are frequently ridiculous, let them be ad|dre&s;&s;ed where they will; but at the Front, or in the Body of a Libel, to commend a Man, is &s;ay|ing to the Per&s;ons applauded, <HI>My Lord, or, Sir, I have pulled down all Men that the re&s;t of the World think Great and Honourable, and here is a clear Stage; you may as you plea&s;e be valiant or wi&s;e, you may choo&s;e to be on the Military or Civil Li&s;t; for there is no one brave who commands, or ju&s;t who has Power: You may rule the World now it is empty, which exploded you when it was full: I have knocked out the Brains of all whom Mankind thought good for any Thing; and I doubt not, but you will reward that Invention, which &s;ound out</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="271">
<HI>the only Expedient to make your Lord&s;hip, or your Wor&s;hip, of any Con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>Had I the Honour to be in a Libel, and had e&s;caped the Approbation of the Author, I &s;hould look upon it exactly in this Manner. But tho' it is a Thing thus perfectly indifferent, who is ex|alted or deba&s;ed in &s;uch Performances, yet it is not &s;o with Relation to the Authors of them; therefore I &s;hall, for the good of my Country, hereafter take upon me to puni&s;h the&s;e Wretches. What is already pa&s;s'd may die away according to its Nature, and continue in its pre&s;ent Oblivi|on; but for the future, I &s;hall take Notice of &s;uch Enemies to Honour and Virtue, and pre|&s;erve them to immortal Infamy: Their Names &s;hall give fre&s;h Offence many Ages hence, and be detected a Thou&s;and Years after the Commi&s;&s;ion of their Crime. It &s;hall not avail, that the&s;e Children of Infamy publi&s;h their Works under &s;eigned Names, or under none at all; for I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> perfectly well acquainted with the Styles of all my Contemporaries, that I &s;hall not fail of do|ing them Ju&s;tice, with their proper Names, and at their full Length. Let therefore the&s;e Mi&s;|creants enjoy their pre&s;ent Act of Oblivion, and take Care how they offend hereafter.</P>
<P>But to avert our Eyes from &s;uch Objects, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">thinks but requi&s;ite to &s;ettle our Opinion in the Ca&s;e of Prai&s;e and Blame; and I believe, the on|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Way to cure that Sen&s;ibility of Reproach. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hich is a common Weakne&s;s with the mo&s;t vir|tuous Men, is to fix their Regard firmly upon on|ly what is &s;trictly true, in Relation to their Ad|vantage, as well as Diminution.

<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Humour of writing Epi&s;tles, and publi&s;hing their ful&s;ome Compliments to each other, is a Thing I frequently complain of in this Place. It is, methinks, from the Preva|lence of this &s;illy Cu&s;tom, that there is &s;o little In&s;truction in the Conver&s;ation of our di&s;tant Friends: For which Rea&s;on, during the whole Cour&s;e of my Life, I have de&s;ired my Acquain|tance, when they write to me, rather to &s;ay &s;omething which &s;hould make me wi&s;h my &s;elf with them, than make me Compliments that they wi&s;hed them&s;elves with me. By this Means, I have by me a Collection of Letters from mo&s;t Parts of the World, which are as naturally of the Growth of the Place, as any Herb, Tree or Plant, of the Soil. This I take to be the proper U&s;e of an Epi&s;tolary Commerce. To de&s;ire to know how <HI>Damon</HI> goes on with his Court&s;hip to <HI>Silvia,</HI> or how the Wine ta&s;ts at the <HI>Old, Devil,</HI> are thread-bare Subjects, and cold Treats, which our ab&s;ent Friends might have given us without go|ing out of Town for 'em. A Friend of mine who went to travel, u&s;ed me far otherwi&s;e; for he gave me a Pro&s;pect of the Place, or an Account of the People, from every Country through which be pa&s;&s;ed. Among others which I was looking ever this Evening, I am not a little de|lighted with this which follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe this is the fir&s;t Letter that was ever &s;ent you from the Middle Region, where I am at this pre&s;ent Writing. Not to keep you in Su&s;|pence,
<PB N="269" REF="274">
it comes to you from the Top of the highe&s;t Mountain in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> where I am now &s;hiver|ing among the eternal Fro&s;ts and Snows. I can &s;carce forbear dating it in <HI>December,</HI> though they call it the Fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at the Bottom of the Mountain. I a&s;&s;ure you, I can hardly keep my Ink from freez|ing in the middle of the Dog-Days. I am here en|tertained with the prettie&s;t Variety of Snow-Pro|&s;pects that you can imagine, and have &s;everal Pits of it before me that are very near as old as the Mountain it &s;elf; for in this Country, it is as la&s;t|ing as Marble. I am now upon a Spot of it, which they tell me fell about the Reign of <HI>Charlemain</HI> or King <HI>Pepin.</HI> The Inhabitants of the Country are as great Curio&s;ities as the Country it &s;elf: They ge|nerally hire them&s;elves out in their Youth, and if they are Mu&s;quet-Proof till about Fifty, they bring Home the Money they have got, and the Limbs they have left, to pa&s;s the re&s;t of their Time among their native Mountains. One of the Gentlemen of the Place, who is come off with the Lo&s;s of an Eye only, told me by Way of Boa&s;t, That there were now &s;even Wooden Legs in his Family; and that for the&s;e four Generations, there had not been one in his Line that carried a whole Body with him to the Grave. I believe you will think the Style of this Letter a little extraordinary; but the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> will tell you, that <HI>People in Clouds mu&s;t not be confined to &s;peak Sen&s;e;</HI> and I hope we that are above them may claim the &s;ame Privilege.

<P>A Gentleman, who is apt to expatiate upon any Hint, took this Occa&s;ion to deliver his Opinion upon our ordinary Method of &s;ending young Gen|tlemen to travel for their Education. It is certain, &s;aid he, if Gentlemen travel at an Age proper for them, during the Cour&s;e of their Voyages, their Accounts to their Friends, and after their Return, their Di&s;cour&s;es and Conver&s;ations, will have in them &s;omething above what we can meet with from tho&s;e who have not had tho&s;e Advantages. At the &s;ame Time it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that every Temper and Genius is not qualified for this Way of Improvement. Men may change their Cli|mate, but they cannot their Nature. A Man that goes out a Fool, cannot ride or &s;ail him&s;elf into common Sen&s;e. Therefore let me but walk over <HI>London-Bridge</HI> with a young Man, and I'll tell you infallibly whether going over the <HI>Rialto</HI> at <HI>Venice</HI> will make him wi&s;er.</P>
<P>It is not to be imagined how many I have &s;aved in my Time from Bani&s;hment, by letting their Parents know they were good for nothing. But this is to be done with much Tenderne&s;s. There is my Cou&s;in <HI>Harry</HI> has a Son, who is the dulle&s;t Mortal that was ever born into our Hou&s;e: He had got his Trunk and his Books all pack'd up to be tran&s;ported into Foreign Parts, for no Rea&s;on but becau&s;e the Boy never talked; and his Father &s;aid, he wanted to know the World. I could not &s;ay to a fond Parent that the Boy was dull, but looked grave; and told him, the Youth was very thoughtful, and I feared he might have &s;ome Doubts about Religion, with which it was not proper to go into <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholick Countries. He is accordingly kept here till he declares him|&s;elf upon &s;ome Points, which I am &s;ure he will never think of. By this Means I have prevented the Di&s;honour of having a Fool of our Hou&s;e
<PB N="271" REF="276">
laughed at in all Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> He is now with his Father upon his own E&s;tate, and he has &s;ent to me to get him a Wife, which I &s;hall do with all convenient Speed; but it &s;hall be &s;uch a one, who&s;e good Nature &s;hall hide his Faults, and good Sen&s;e &s;upply 'em. The Truth of it is, that Race is of the true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kind: They are of our Country only; it hurts 'em to tran&s;plant 'em, and they are de&s;troyed if you pretend to improve 'em. Men of this &s;olid Make are not to be hurried up and down the World, for (if I may &s;o &s;peak) they are naturally at their Wit's End; and it is an impertinent Part to di&s;turb their Repo&s;e, that they may give you only an Hi&s;tory of their Bodily Occurrences, which is all they are capable of ob&s;erving. <HI>Harry</HI> had an el|der Brother who was tried in his Way: I re|member all he could talk of at his Return was, That he had like to have been drowned at &s;uch a Place, he fell our of a Cha&s;e at another, he had a better Stomach when he moved Northward than when he turned his Cour&s;e to the Parts in the South, and &s;o forth. It is therefore very much to be con&s;idered, what Sen&s;e a Per&s;on has of Things when he is &s;etting out; and if he then knows none of his Friends and Acquaintance but by their Clothes and Faces, it is my Opinion, that he &s;tay at Home. His Parents &s;hould take Care to marry him, and &s;ee what they can get out of him that Way; for there is a certain Sort of Men, who are no otherwi&s;e to be regarded but as they de&s;cend from Men of Con&s;equence, and may beget valuable Succe&s;&s;ors. And if we con|&s;ider, that Men are to be e&s;teemed only as they are u&s;eful, while a &s;tupid Wretch is at the Head of a great Family, we may &s;ay, the Race is &s;u&s;pended, as properly as when it is all gone, we &s;ay, it is extinct.</P>

<P>I had &s;everal Hints and Adverti&s;ements from unknown Hands, that &s;ome, who are Enemies to my Labours, de&s;ign to demand the fa&s;hionable Way of Satisfaction for the Di&s;turbance my Lu|cubrations have given them. I confe&s;s, as Things now &s;tand, I don't know how to deny &s;uch Invi|ters, and am preparing my &s;elf accordingly: I have brought Pumps and Files, and am every Morning practi&s;ing in my Chamber. My Neigh|bour, the Dancing-Ma&s;ter, has demanded of me, Why I take this Liberty, &s;ince I would not al|low it him? But I an&s;wered, His was an Act of an indifferent Nature, and mine of Nece&s;&s;ity. My late Treati&s;es again&s;t Duels have &s;o far di&s;|obliged the Fraternity of the noble Science of Defencee, that I can get none of them to &s;how me &s;o much as one Pa&s;s. I am therefore obliged to learn by Book, and have accordingly &s;everal Volumes, wherein all the Po&s;tures are exactly delineated. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am &s;hy of letting People &s;ee me at this Exerci&s;e, becau&s;e of my Flannel Wa&s;tcoat, and my Spectacles, which I am forced to fix on, the better to ob&s;erve the Po&s;ture of the Enemy.</P>
<P>I have upon my Chamber-Walls, drawn at full Length, the Figures of all Sorts of Men, from Eight Foot to Three Foot Two Inches. Within this Height I take it, that all the fighting Men of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are comprehended. But as I pu&s;h, I make Allowances for my being of a lank and &s;pare Body, and have chalked out in every Figure my own Dimen&s;ions; for I &s;corn to rob any Man of his Life by taking Advantage of his Breadth: Therefore I pre&s;s purely in a Line down from his No&s;e, and take no more of him to a&s;&s;ault, than he has of me: For to &s;peak impartially, if a lean Fel|low wounds a fat One in any Part to the Right or Left, whether it be in Cart or in Ter&s;e, beyond the Dimen&s;ions of the &s;aid lean Fellow's own
<PB N="273" REF="278">
Breadth, I take it to be Murder, and &s;uch a Mur|der as is below a Gentleman to commit. As I am &s;pare, I am al&s;o very tall, and behave my &s;elf with Relation to that Advantage with the &s;ame Punctilio; and I am ready to &s;toop or &s;tand, ac|cording to the Stature of my Adver&s;ary. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have had great Succe&s;s this Morning, and have hit every Figure round the Room in a mortal Part, without receiving the lea&s;t Hurt, ex|cept a little Scratch by falling on my Face, in pu&s;hing at one at the lower End of my Cham|ber; but I recovered &s;o quick, and jumped &s;o nimbly into my Guard, that if he had been alive, he could not have hurt me. It is confe&s;&s;ed, I have writ again&s;t Duels with &s;ome Warmth; but in all my Di&s;cour&s;es, I have not ever &s;aid, that I knew how a Gentleman could avoid a Duel if he were provoked to it; and &s;ince that Cu&s;tom is now become a Law, I know nothing but the Le|gi&s;lative Power, with new Animadver&s;ions upon it, can put us in a Capacity of denying Chal|lenges, though we are afterwards hanged for it. But no more of this at pre&s;ent. As Things &s;tand, I &s;hall put up no more Affronts; and I &s;hall be &s;o far from taking ill Words, that I will not take ill Looks. I therefore warn all young hot Fel|lows, not to look hereafter more terrible than their Neighbours; for if they &s;tare at me with their Hats cocked higher than other People, I won't bear it. Nay, I give Warning to all Peo|ple in general to look kindly at me; for I'll bear no Frowns, even from Ladies; and if any Wo|man pretends to look &s;cornfully at me, I &s;hall de|mand Satisfaction of the next of Kin of the Ma&s;|culine Gender.</P>

<P>THat which we call Gallantry to Women, &s;eems to be the heroick Virtue of private Per&s;ons; and there never breathed one Man, who did not, in that Part of his Days wherein he was recommending him&s;elf to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, do &s;ome|thing beyond his ordinary Cour&s;e of Life. As this has a very great Effect even upon the mo&s;t &s;low and common Men; &s;o, upon &s;uch as it finds qualified with Virtue and Merit, it &s;hines out in p oportionable Degrees of Excellence: It gives new Grace to the mo&s;t eminent Accompli&s;h|ments; and he, who of him&s;elf has either Wit, Wi&s;dom, or Valour, exerts each of the&s;e noble Endowments when he becomes a Lover, with a certain Beauty of Action above what was ever ob&s;erved in him before; and all who are without any one of the&s;e Qualities, are to be looked up|on as the Rabble of Mankind. I was talking after this Manner in a Corner of this Place with an old Acquaintance, who taking me by the Hand, &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> your Di&s;cour&s;e recals to my Mind a Story, which I have longed to tell you ever &s;ince I read that Article, wherein you de&s;ire your Friends to give you Accounts of ob&s;cure Me|rit. The Story I had of him is literally true, and well known to be &s;o in the Country wherein the Circum&s;tances were tran&s;acted. He acquainted me with the Names of the Per&s;ons concerned,
<PB N="275" REF="280">
which I &s;hall change into feigned Ones, there being a Re&s;pect due to their Families, that are &s;till in Being, as well as that the Names them|&s;elves would not be &s;o familiar to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ear. The Adventure really happened in <HI>Denmark;</HI> and if I can remember all the Pa&s;&s;ages, I doubt not but it will be as moving to my Readers as it was to me.</P>
<P><HI>Clarinda</HI> and <HI>Chloe,</HI> Two very fine Women, were bred up as Si&s;ters in the Family of <HI>Romeo,</HI> who was the Father of <HI>Chloe,</HI> and the Guardian of <HI>Clarinda. Philander,</HI> a young Gentleman of a good Per&s;on, and charming Conver&s;ation, be|ing a Friend of old <HI>Romeo</HI>'s, frequented his Hou&s;e, and by that Means was much in Conver|&s;ation with the young Ladies, though &s;till in the Pre&s;ence of the Father and the Guardian. The Ladies both entertained a &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ion for him, and could &s;ee well enough, notwith&s;tanding the Delight which he really took in <HI>Romeo</HI>'s Conver|&s;ation, that there was &s;omething more in his Heart which made him &s;o a&s;&s;iduous a Vi&s;itant. Each of them thought her &s;elf the happy Wo|man; but the Per&s;on beloved was <HI>Chloe.</HI> It happened that both of them were at a Play in a Carnaval Evening, when it is the Fa&s;hion there (as well as in mo&s;t Countries of <HI>Europe</HI>) both for Men and Women to appear in Masks and Di&s;|gui&s;es. It was on that memorable Night in the Year 1679, when the Playhou&s;e, by &s;ome un|happy Accident, was &s;et on Fire. <HI>Philander,</HI> in the fir&s;t Hurry of the Di&s;a&s;ter, immediately ran where his Trea&s;ure was, bur&s;t open the Door of the Box, &s;natched the Lady up in his Arms, and with un&s;peakable Re&s;olution and good Fortune carried her off &s;afe. He was no &s;ooner out of the Crowd, but he &s;et her down; and gra&s;ping her in his Arms, with all the Raptures of a de&s; rving Lover, How happy am I, &s;ays he, in an Oppor|tunity to tell you I love you more than all
<PB N="276" REF="281">
Things, and of &s;hewing you the Sincerity of my Pa&s;&s;ion at the very fir&s;t Declaration of it. My dear, dear <HI>Philander,</HI> &s;ays the Lady, pulling off her Mask, this is not a Time for Art; you are much dearer to me than the Life you have pre|&s;erved: And the Joy of my pre&s;ent Deliverance does not tran&s;port me &s;o much as the Pa&s;&s;ion which occa&s;ioned it. Who can tell the Grief, the A&s;toni&s;hment, the Terror, that appeared in the Face of <HI>Philander,</HI> when he &s;aw the Per&s;on he &s;poke to was <HI>Clarinds.</HI> After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, Ma|dam, &s;ays he, with the Looks of a dead Man, we are both mi&s;taken; and immediately flew away, without hearing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Clarinda,</HI> who had ju&s;t Strength enough to cry out, Cruel <HI>Philander,</HI> Why did you not leave me in the Theatre? Crowds of People immediately ga|thered about her, and after having brought her to her &s;elf, conveyed her to the Hou&s;e of the good old unhappy <HI>Romeo. Philander</HI> was now pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t a whole Tide of People at the Doors of the Theatre, and &s;triving to enter with more Earne&s;tne&s;s than any there endeavoured to get out. He did it at la&s;t, and with much Diffi|culty forced his Way to the Box where his beloved <HI>Chloe</HI> &s;tood, expecting her Fate amid&s;t this Scene of Terror and Di&s;traction. She revived at the Sight of <HI>Philander,</HI> who fell about her Neck with a Tenderne&s;s not to be expre&s;&s;ed; and amid&s;t a Thou&s;and Sobs and Sighs, told her his Love, and his dreadful Mi&s;take. The Stage was now in Flames, and the whole Hou&s;e full of Smoke; the Entrance was quite barred up with Heaps of People, who had fallen upon one another as they endeavoured to get out; Swords were drawn, Shrieks heard on all Sides; and in &s;hort, no Po&s;&s;ibility of an E&s;cape for <HI>Philander</HI> him&s;elf, had he been capable of making it without his <HI>Chloe.</HI> But his Mind was above &s;uch a Thought, and wholly employed in weeping, condoling,
<PB N="277" REF="282">
and comforting. He catches her in his Arms. The Fire &s;urrounds them, while&mdash;I cannot go on&mdash;</P>
<P>Were I an Infidel, Misfortunes like this would convince me, that there mu&s;t be an Hereafter: For who can believe, that &s;o much Virtue could meet with &s;o great Di&s;tre&s;s without a following Reward. As for my Part, I am &s;o old-fa&s;hioned, as firmly to believe, that all who peri&s;h in &s;uch generous Enterprizes, are relieved from the fur|ther Exerci&s;e of Life; and Providence; which &s;ees their Virtue con&s;ummate and manife&s;t, takes them to an immediate Reward, in a Being more &s;uitable to the Grandeur of their Spirits. What el&s;e can wipe away our Tears, when we contem|plate &s;uch unde&s;erved, &s;uch irreparable Di&s;tre&s;&s;es? It was a &s;ublime Thought in &s;ome of the Hea|thens of old:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Quae Gratia Curr&ucirc;m</L>
<L>Armorumque fuit Vivis, quae Cura nitentes</L>
<L>Pa&s;cere Equos, eadem &s;equitur Tellure rep&ocirc;&s;tos.</L></Q>

<P>When I came Home this Evening, I found a Pre&s;ent from Mr. <HI>Charles Lillie,</HI> the Perfumer at the Corner of <HI>Beauford-Buildings,</HI> with a Letter of Thanks for the Mention I made of him.

<HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> College. I recommend it to the Hand|kerchiefs of all young Pleaders: It cures or &s;up|plies all Pau&s;es and Hentations in Speech, and creates a general Alacrity of the Spirit. When it is u&s;ed as a Gargle, it gives Volubility to the Tongue, and never fails of that nece&s;&s;ary Step towards plea&s;ing others, making a Man plea&s;ed with him&s;elf. I have taken Security of him, That he &s;hall not rai&s;e the Price of any of his Com|modities for the&s;e or any other occult Quali|ties in them; but he is to &s;ell them at the &s;ame Price which you give at the common Perfumers.

<P>THere are &s;everal Per&s;ons who have many Plea|&s;ures and Entertainments in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which they do not enjoy. It is therefore a kind and good Office to acquaint them with their own Happine&s;s, and turn their Attention to &s;uch In|&s;tances of their good Fortune which they are apt to overlook. Per&s;ons in the married State often want &s;uch a Monitor, and pine away their Days, by looking upon the &s;ame Condition in Angui&s;h and Murmur, which carries with it in the Opinion of othe s a Complication of all the Plea&s;ures of Life, and a Retreat from its Inquietudes.</P>
<P>I am led into this Thought by a Vi&s;it I made an old Friend, who was formerly my School-fellow. He came to Town la&s;t Week with his Family for the Winter, and Ye&s;terday Morning &s;ent me Word his Wife expected me to Dinner. I am as it were at Home at that Hou&s;e, and every Member of it knows me for their Well-wi&s;her. I cannot indeed expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure it is, to be met by the Children with &s;o much Joy as I am when I go thither: The Boys and Girls &s;trive who &s;hall come fir&s;t when they think it is I that am knocking at the Door; and that Child which lo&s;es the Race to me, runs back again to tell the Father it is Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff.</HI> This Day I was led in by a pretty Girl that we all thought mu&s;t have forgot me; for the Family has been out of
<PB N="280" REF="285">
Town the&s;e Two Years. Her knowing me again was a mighty Subject with us, and took up our Di&s;cour&s;e at the fir&s;t Entrance. After which, they began to rally me upon a Thou&s;and little Stories they heard in the Country about my Mar|riage to one of my Neighbour's Daughters: Upon which the Gentleman, my Friend, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Nay, if Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> marries a Child of any of his old Companions, I hope mine &s;hall have the Preference; there's Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> is now Six|teen, and would make him as fine a Widow as the be&s;t of them: But I know him too well; he is &s;o enamour'd with the very Memory of tho&s;e who flouri&s;h'd in our Youth, that he will not &s;o much as look upon the modern Beauties. I re|member, old Gentleman, how often you went Home in a Day to refre&s;h your Countenance and Dre&s;s when <HI>Teraminta</HI> reign'd in your Heart. As we came up in the Coach, I repeat|ed to my Wife &s;ome of your Ver&s;es on her."</Q> With &s;uch Reflections on little Pa&s;&s;ages which happened long ago, we pa&s;&s;ed our Time during a chearful and elegant Meal. After Dinner his Lady left the Room, as did al&s;o the Children. As &s;oon as we were alone, he took me by the Hand; Well, my good Friend, &s;ays he, I am heartily glad to &s;ee thee; I was afraid you would never have &s;een all the Company that dined with you to Day again. Do not you think the good Woman of the Hou&s;e a little alter'd &s;ince you followed her from the Play-hou&s;e, to find out who &s;he was for me? I perceived a Tear fall down his Cheek as he &s;poke, which moved me not a little. But to turn the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid I, She is not indeed quite that Creature &s;he was when &s;he returned me the Letter I carried from you; and told me, She hoped, as I was a Gentle|man, I would be employ'd no more to trouble her who had never offended me, but would be &s;o much the Gentleman's Friend as to di&s;&s;wade him
<PB N="281" REF="286">
from a Pur&s;uit which he could never &s;ucceed in. You may remember, I thought her in earne&s;t, and you were forced to employ your Cou&s;in <HI>Will.</HI> who made his Si&s;ter get acquainted with her for you. You cannot expect her to be for ever Fif|teen. Fifteen? replied my good Friend: Ah! You little under&s;tand, you that have lived a Batche|lor, how great, how exqui&s;ite, a Plea&s;ure there is in being really beloved! It is impo&s;&s;ible that the mo&s;t beauteous Face in Nature &s;hould rai&s;e in me &s;uch plea&s;ing Ideas, as when I look upon that excellent Woman. That Fading in her Countenance is chiefly cau&s;ed by her watching with me in my Fever. This was followed by a Fit of Sickne&s;s, which had like to have carried her off la&s;t Winter. I tell you &s;incerely, I have &s;o many Obligations to her, that I cannot with any Sort of Moderation think of her pre&s;ent State of Health. But as to what you &s;ay of Fifteen, &s;he gives me every Day Plea&s;ures beyond what I ever knew in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Beauty when I was in the Vigour of Youth. Every Moment of her Life brings me fre&s;h In&s;tances of her Complacency to my Inclinations, and her Prudence in Regard to my Fortune. Her Face is to me much more beautiful than when I fir&s;t &s;aw it; there is no Decay in any Feature which I cannot trace from the very In&s;tant it was occa|&s;ioned, by &s;ome anxious Concern for my Wel|fare and Intere&s;ts. Thus at the &s;ame Time, methinks, the Love I conceived towards her for what &s;he was, is heightened by my Gratitude for what &s;he is. The Love of a Wife is as much above the idle Pa&s;&s;ion commonly called by that Name, as the loud Laughter of Buffoons is in|ferior to the elegant Mirth of Gentlemen. Oh! &s;he is an ine&s;timable Jewel. In her Examina|tion of her Hou&s;hold Affairs, &s;he &s;hows a cer|tain Fearfulne&s;s to find a Fault, which makes her Servants obey her like Children; and the
<PB N="282" REF="287">
meane&s;t we have, has an ingenuous Shame for an Offence, not always to be &s;een in Children in other Families. I &s;peak freely to you, my old Friend; ever &s;ince her Sickne&s;s, Things that gave me the quicke&s;t Joy before, turn now to a cer|tain Anxiety. As the Children play in the next Room, I know the poor Things by their Steps, and am con&s;idering what they mu&s;t do &s;hould they lo&s;e their Mother in their tender Years. The Plea&s;ure I u&s;ed to take in telling my Boy Stories of the Battles, and asking my Girl Que&s;tions a|bout the Di&s;po&s;al of her Baby, and the Go&s;&s;iping of it, is turned into inward Reflection and Me|lancholy.</P>
<P>He would have gone on in this tender Way, when the good Lady entered, and with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Sweetne&s;s in her Countenance told us, &s;he had been &s;earching her Clo&s;et for &s;omething very good to treat &s;uch an old Friend as I was. Her Hu&s;|band's Eyes &s;parkled with Plea&s;ure at the Chear|fulne&s;s of her Countenance; and I &s;aw all his Fears vani&s;h in an In&s;tant. The Lady ob&s;erving &s;omething in our Looks which &s;hewed we had been more &s;erious than ordinary, and &s;eeing her Husband receive her with great Concern under a forced Chearfulne&s;s, immediately gue&s;&s;ed at what we had been talking of; and applying her &s;elf to me, &s;aid, with a Smile, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> don't be|lieve a Word of what he tells you, I &s;hall &s;till live to have you for my Second, as I have often promi&s;ed you, unle&s;s he takes more Care of him|&s;elf than he has done &s;ince his coming to Town. You mu&s;t know, he tells me, That he finds <HI>Lon|don</HI> is a much more healthy Place than the Coun|try; for he &s;ees &s;everal of his old Acquaintance and School-fellows are here, young Fellows with fair full-bottom'd Periwigs. I could &s;carce keep him this Morning from going out open|brea&s;ted. My Friend, who is always extreamly delighted with her agreeable Humour, made her
<PB N="283" REF="288">
&s;it down with us. She did it with that Ea&s;ine&s;s which is peculiar to Women of Sen&s;e; and to keep up the good Humour &s;he had brought in with her, turned her Raillery upon me: Mr. <HI>Bick|er&s;taff,</HI> you remember you followed me one Night from the Play-hou&s;e; &s;uppo&s;ing you &s;hould carry me thither to Morrow Night, and lead me into the Front-Box. This put us into a long Field of Di&s;cour&s;e about the Beauties, who were Mothers to the pre&s;ent, and &s;hined in the Boxes Twenty Years ago. I told her, I was glad &s;he had tran&s;|ferred &s;o many of her Charms, and I did not que&s;tion but her elde&s;t Daughter was within half a Year of being a Toa&s;t.</P>
<P>We were plea&s;ing our &s;elves with this fanta&s;ti|cal Preferment of the young Lady, when on a &s;udden we were alarm'd with the Noi&s;e of a Drum, and immediately enter'd my little God&s;on to give me a Point of War.

<P>IT has co&s;t me very much Care and Thought to mar&s;hal and fix the People under their pro|per Denominations, and to range them accor|ding to their re&s;pective Characters. The&s;e my Endeavours have been received with unexpected Succe&s;s in one Kind, but neglected in another: For though I have many Readers, I have but few Converts. This mu&s;t certainly proceed from a fal&s;e Opinion, That what I write is de&s;igned rather to amu&s;e and entertain, than convince and in&s;truct. I enter'd upon my E&s;&s;ays with a Decla|ration, that I &s;hould con&s;ider Mankind in quite another Manner than they had hitherto been re|pre&s;ented to the ordinary World; and a&s;&s;erted, that none but an u&s;eful Life &s;hould be with me any Life at all. But le&s;t this Doctrine &s;hould have made this &s;mall Progre&s;s towards the Con|viction of Mankind, becau&s;e it may appear to the Unlearned light and whim&s;ical, I mu&s;t take Leave to unfold the Wi&s;dom and Antiquity of my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition in the&s;e my E&s;&s;ays, to wit, That <HI>every Worthle&s;s Man is a Dead Man.</HI> This Notion is as old as <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> in who&s;e School it was a Point of Di&s;cipline, That if among the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>Probationers,</HI> there were any who grew weary of &s;tudying to be u&s;eful, and re|turned
<PB N="286" REF="291">
to an idle Life, the re&s;t were to regard them as dead; and upon their Departing, to per|form their Ob&s;equies, and rai&s;e them Tombs with In&s;criptions to warn others of the like Mortality, and quicken them to Re&s;olutions of refining their Souls above that wretched State. It is upon a like Suppo&s;ition, that young Ladies at this very Time in <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholick Countries are receiv'd into &s;ome Nunneries with their Cof|fins, and with the Pomp of a formal Funeral, to &s;ignifie, That henceforth they are to be of no further U&s;e, and con&s;equently Dead. Nor was <HI>Pythagoras</HI> him&s;elf the fir&s;t Author of this Sym|bol, with whom, and with the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> it was generally receiv'd. Much more might be offered in Illu&s;tration of this Doctrine from Sacred Au|thority, which I recommend to my Reader's own Reflection; who will ea&s;ily recollect, from Places which I do not think fit to quote here, the forcible Manner of applying the Words, Dead and Living, to Men as they are Good or Bad.</P>
<P>I have therefore compo&s;ed the following Scheme of Exi&s;tence for the Benefit both of the Living and the Dead, tho' chiefly for the latter, whom I mu&s;t de&s;ire to read it with all po&s;&s;ible Attention. In the Number of the Dead, I com|prehend all Per&s;ons, of what Title or Dignity &s;oever, who be&s;tow mo&s;t of their Time in Eat|ing and Drinking to &s;upport that imaginary Exi&s;tence of theirs, which they call Life; or in dre&s;&s;ing and adorning tho&s;e Shadows and Appa|ritions which are look'd upon by the Vulgar as real Men and Women. In &s;hort, whoever re&s;ides in the World without having any Bu&s;ine&s;s in it, and pa&s;&s;es away an Age without ever thinking on the Errand for which he was &s;ent hithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, is to me a Dead Man to all Intents and Purpo&s;es; and I de&s;ire that he may be &s;o reputed. The Li|ving are only tho&s;e that are &s;ome Way or other
<PB N="287" REF="292">
laudably employed in the Improvement of their own Minds, or for the Advantage of others; and even among the&s;e, I &s;hall only reckon into their Lives that Part of their Time which has been &s;pent in the Manner above-mentioned. By there Means, I am afraid, we &s;hall find the longe&s;t Lives not to con&s;i&s;t of many Months, and the greate&s;t Part of the Earth to be quite unpeopled. According to this Sy&s;tem we may ob&s;erve, that &s;ome Men are born at Twenty Years of Age, &s;ome at Thirty, &s;ome at Three&s;core, and &s;ome not above an Hour before they die; nay, we may ob&s;erve Multitudes that die without ever being born, as well as many dead Per&s;ons that fill up the Bulk of Mankind, and make a better Figure in the Eyes of the Ignorant, than tho&s;e who are alive, and in their proper and full State of Health. However, &s;ince there may be many good Subjects that pay their Taxes, and live peaceably in their Habitations, who are not yet born, or have departed this Life &s;everal Years &s;ince, my De&s;ign is, to encourage both to join them&s;elves as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the Number of the Living: For as I invite the former to break forth into Being, and become good for &s;ome|thing, &s;o I allow the latter a State of Refu&s;ci|tation; which I chiefly mention for the Sake of a Per&s;on, who has lately publi&s;hed an Ad|verti&s;ement, with &s;everal &s;currilous Terms in it, that do by no Means become a dead Man to give: It is my departed Friend <HI>John Par|tridge,</HI> who conclud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Adverti&s;ement of his next Year's Almanack with the following Note:</P>

up an Humour of coming to Town in Red Coats, whom an arch Wag of my Acquaintance u&s;ed to de&s;cribe very well, by calling them Sheep in Wolves Cloathing. I have often wondered, that hone&s;t Gentlemen, who are good Neighbours, and live quietly in their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;hould take it in their Heads to frighten the Town after this unrea&s;onable Manner. I &s;hall think my &s;elf obliged, if they per&s;i&s;t in &s;o unnatural a Dre&s;s notwith&s;tanding any Po&s;ts they may have in the Militia) to give away their Red Coats to any of the Soldiery who &s;hall think fit to &s;trip them, provided the &s;aid Soldiers can make it appear, that they belong to a Regiment where there is a Defi|ciency in the Cloathing.</P>
<P>About Two Days ago I was walking in the <HI>Park,</HI> and accidentally met a Rural 'Squire, cloathed in all the Types above-mentioned, with a Carriage and Behaviour made entirely out of his own Head. He was of a Bulk and Stature larger than ordinary, had a Red Coat, flung open to &s;how a gay Calamanco Wa&s;tcoat: His Periwig fell in a very con&s;iderable Bu&s;h upon each Shoulder: His Arms naturally &s;wang at an unrea&s;onable Di&s;tance from his Sides; which with the Advantage of a Cane, that he bran|di&s;hed in a great Variety of irregular Motions, made it un&s;afe for any one to walk within &s;eve|ral Yards of him. In this Manner he took up the whole <HI>Mall,</HI> his Spectators moving on each Side of it, whil&s;t he cocked up his Hat, and marched directly for <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> I cannot tell who this Gentleman is, but for my Comfort may &s;ay, with the Lover in <HI>Terence,</HI> who lo&s;t Sight of a fine young Lady; <HI>Wherever thou art, Thou can&s;t not be long concealed.</HI></P>

For my Part, when I take a Survey of this populous
<PB N="291" REF="296">
City, I can &s;carce forbear weeping, to &s;ee how few of its Inhabitants are now living. It was with this Thought that I drew up my la&s;t Bill of Mortality, and endeavoured to &s;et out in it the great Number of Per&s;ons who have peri&s;hed by a Di&s;temper (commonly known by the Name of Idlene&s;s) which has long raged in the World, and de&s;troys more in every great Town than the Plague has done at <HI>Dantzick.</HI> To repair the Mi&s;chief it has done, and &s;tock the World with a better Race of Mortals, I have more Hopes of bringing to Life tho&s;e that are young, than of reviving tho&s;e that are old. For which Rea&s;on, I &s;hall here &s;et down that noble Alle|gory which was written by an old Author cal|led <HI>Prodicus,</HI> but recommended and embelli&s;hed by <HI>Socrates.</HI> It is the De&s;cription of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> making their Court to <HI>Hercules</HI> un|der the Appearances of Two beautiful Wo|men.</P>
<P>When <HI>Hercules,</HI> &s;ays the divine Morali&s;t, was in that Part of his Youth in which it was natu|ral for him to con&s;ider what Cour&s;e of Life he ought to pur&s;ue, he one Day retired into a De&s;art, where the Silence and Solitude of the Place very much favoured his Meditations. As he was mu&s;ing on his pre&s;ent Condition, and very much perplexed in him&s;elf on the State of Life he &s;hould chu&s;e, he &s;aw Two Women of a larger Stature than ordinary approaching to|wards him. One of them had a very noble Air, and graceful Deportment; her Beauty was na|tural and ea&s;y, her Per&s;on clean and un&s;potted, her Eyes ca&s;t towards the Ground with an agree|able Re&s;erve, her Motion and Behaviour full of Mode&s;ty, and her Raiment as white as Snow. The other had a great deal of Health and Florid|ne&s;s in her Countenance, which &s;he had helped with an artificial White and Red, and endeavour'd to appear more graceful than ordinary in her Mien,
<PB N="292" REF="297">
by a Mixture of Affectation in all her Ge&s;tures. She had a wonderful Confidence and A&s;&s;urance in her Looks, and all the Variety of Colours in her Dre&s;s that &s;he thought were the mo&s;t proper to &s;how her Complexion to an Advantage. She ca&s;t her Eyes upon her &s;elf, then turned them on tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, to &s;ee how they liked her, and often looked on the Figure &s;he made in her own Shadow. Upon her nearer Approach to <HI>Hercules,</HI> &s;he &s;tepped before the other Lady, (who came forward with a regular compo&s;ed Carriage) and running up to him, acco&s;ted him after the following Manner:</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Hercules,</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) I find you are ve|ry much divided in your own Thoughts upon the Way of Life that you ought to chu&s;e: Be my Friend, and follow me; I'll lead you into the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Plea&s;ure, and out of the Reach of Pain, and remove you from all the Noi&s;e and Di&s;quie|tude of Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Affairs of either War or Peace &s;hall have no Power to di&s;turb you. Your whole Employment &s;hall be to make your Life ea&s;y, and to entertain every Sen&s;e with its proper Gratification Sumptuous Tables, Beds of Ro&s;es, Clouds of Perfumes, Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick, Crowds of Beauties, are all in a Readine&s;s to receive you. Come along with me into this Region of De|lights, this World of Plea&s;ure, and bid Farewel for ever to Care, to Pain, to Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Hercules</HI> hearing the Lady talk after this Man|ner, de&s;ired to know her Name; to which &s;he an&s;wered, My Friends, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with me, call me <HI>Happine&s;s;</HI> but my Enemies, and tho&s;e who would injure my Repu|tation, have given me the Name of <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time the other Lady was come up, who addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf to the young Hero in a very different Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="298">
<HI>Hercules,</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) I offer my &s;elf to you, be|cau&s;e I know you are de&s;cended from the Gods, and give Proofs of that De&s;cent by your Love to Virtue, and Application to the Studies pro|per for your Age. This makes me hope you will gain both for your &s;elf and me an immortal Re|putation. But before I invite you into my So|ciety and Friend&s;hip, I will be open and &s;incere with you, and mu&s;t lay down this as an e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Truth, That there is nothing truly va|luable which can be purcha&s;ed without Pains and Labour. The Gods have &s;et a Price upon every real and noble Plea&s;ure. If you would gain the Favour of the Derty, you mu&s;t be at the Pains of wor&s;hipping him; if the Friend&s;hip of good Men, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to oblige them; if you would be honour'd by your Country, you mu&s;t take Care to &s;erve it. In &s;hort, if you would be eminent in War or Peace, you mu&s;t become Ma&s;ter of all the Qualifications that can make you &s;o. The&s;e are the only Terms and Conditions upon which I can propo&s;e Happine&s;s. The God|de&s;s of <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> here broke in upon her Di&s;cour&s;e: You &s;ee (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>Hercules,</HI> by her own Confe&s;|&s;ion, the Way to her Plea&s;ures is long and diffi|cult, whereas that which I propo&s;e is &s;hort and ea&s;y. Alas! (&s;aid the other Lady) who&s;e Vi&s;age glowed with a Pa&s;&s;ion, made up of Scorn and Pi|ty, what are the Plea&s;ures you propo&s;e? To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are a|thir&s;t, &s;leep before you are tired, to gratify Ap|petites before they are rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e &s;uch Ap|petites as Nature never planted. You never heard the mo&s;t delicious Mu&s;ick, which is the Prai&s;e of ones &s;elf; nor &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful Object, which is the Work of ones own Hands. Your Votaries pa&s;s away their Youth in a Dream of mi&s;taken Plea&s;ures, while they are hoarding up Angui&s;h, Torment, and Remor&s;e, for old Age.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="299">
As for me, I am the Friend of Gods and of good Men, an agreeable Companion to the Arti|zan, an Hou&s;hold Guardian to the Fathers of Fa|milies, a Patron and Protector of Servants, an A&s;&s;ociate in all true and generous Friend&s;hips. The Banquets of my Votaries are never co&s;tly, but always delicious; for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by Hunger and Thir&s;t. Their Slumbers are &s;ound, and their Wakings chearful. My young Men have the Plea&s;ure of hearing them&s;elves prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who are in Years, and tho&s;e who are in Years of being honour'd by tho&s;e who are young. In a Word, my Followers are favour'd by the Gods, beloved by their Acquain|tance, e&s;teem'd by their Country, and (after the Clo&s;e of their Labours) honoured by Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We know by the Life of this memorable Hero, to which of the&s;e Two Ladies he gave up his Heart; and I believe, every one who reads this, will do him the Ju&s;tice to approve his Choice.</P>
<P>I very much admire the Speeches of the&s;e La|dies, as containing in them the chief Arguments for a Life of Virtue or a Life of Plea&s;ure that could enter into the Thoughts of an Heathen; but am particularly plea&s;ed with the different Fi|gures he gives the Two Godde&s;&s;es. Our modern Authors have repre&s;ented Plea&s;ure or Vice with an alluring Face, but ending in Snakes and Mon|&s;ters: Here &s;he appears in all the Charms of Beauty, tho' they are all fal&s;e and borrowed; and by that Means, compo&s;es a Vi&s;ion entirely natural and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;lated this Allegory for the Benefit of the Youth of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and particularly of tho&s;e who are &s;till in the deplorable State of Non-Exi&s;tence, and whom I mo&s;t earne&s;tly en|treat to come into the World.

To Women of this worldly Turn, as I appre|hend <HI>Cleora</HI> to be, we mu&s;t reckon backward in our Computation of Merit; and when a fair Lady thinks only of making her Spou&s;e a convenient Dome&s;tick, the Notion of Worth and Value is altered, and the Lover is the more acceptable, the le&s;s he is con&s;iderable.

But in the Mid&s;t of all this Fiercene&s;s, he would &s;ometimes attend the Di&s;cour&s;e of a Man of Sen&s;e, and look at the Charms of a Beauty with his Eyes and Mouth open.

<P>An ingenious and worthy Gentleman, my an|cient Friend, fell into Di&s;cour&s;e with me this Evening upon the Force and Efficacy which the Writings of good Poets have on the Minds of their intelligent Readers, and recommended to me his Sen&s;e of the Matter, thrown together in the following Manner, which he de&s;ired me to communicate to the Youth of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in my E&s;&s;ays; which I chu&s;e to do in his own Words.</P>
<P>I have always been of Opinion, (&s;ays he) that Virtue &s;inks deepe&s;t into the Heart of Man, when it comes recommended by the powerful Charms of Poetry. The mo&s;t active Principle in our Mind is the Imagination: To it a good Poet makes his Court perpetually, and by this Faculty takes Care to gain it fir&s;t. Our Pa&s;&s;ions and Inclinations come over next; and our Rea|&s;on &s;urrenders it &s;elf with Plea&s;ure in the End. Thus the whole Soul is in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed into Morality, by bribing the Fancy with beautiful and agreeable Images of tho&s;e very Things, that in the Books of the Philo&s;ophers appear au&s;tere, and have at the be&s;t but a kind of forbidden A&s;|pect. In a Word, the Poets do, as it were, &s;trew the rough Paths of Virtue &s;o full of Flowers, that we are not &s;en&s;ible of the Unea&s;ine&s;s of them, and imagine our &s;elves in the Mid&s;t of Plea&s;ures, and the mo&s;t bewitching Allurements, at the Time we are making a Progre&s;s in the &s;evere&s;t Duties of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="304">
All then agree, that licentious Poems do of all Writings &s;oone&s;t corrupt the Heart: And why &s;hould we not be as univer&s;ally per&s;waded, that the grave and &s;erious Performances of &s;uch as write in the mo&s;t engaging Manner, by a kind of divine Impul&s;e, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t effectual Per|&s;wa&s;ives to Goodne&s;s? If therefore I were ble&s;&s;ed with a Son, in order to the forming of his Man|ners, (which is making him truly my Son) I &s;hould be continually putting into his Hand &s;ome &s;ine Poet. The graceful Sentences, and the man|ly Sentiments &s;o frequently to be met with in every great and &s;ublime Writer, are, in my Judg|ment, the mo&s;t ornamental and valuable Furni|ture that can be for a young Gentleman's Head; methinks they &s;hew like &s;o much rich Embroide|ry upon the Brain. Let me add to this, That Humanity and Tenderne&s;s (without which there can be no true Greatne&s;s in the Mind) are in|&s;pired by the Mu&s;es in &s;uch pathetical Language, that all we find in Pro&s;e-Authors towards the rai&s;ing and improving of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, is in Compari&s;on but cold, or luke-warm at the be&s;t. There is be&s;ides a certain Elevation of Soul, a &s;e|date Magnanimity, and a noble Turn of Virtue, that di&s;tingui&s;hes the Hero from the plain, hone&s;t Man, to which Ver&s;e can only rai&s;e us. The bold Metaphors and founding Numbers, peculiar to the Poets, rouze up all our &s;leeping Facul|ties, and alarm the whole Powers of the Soul, much like that excellent Trumpeter mentioned by <HI>Virgil:</HI></P>

<P>I fell into this Train of Thinking this Even|ing, upon reading a Pa&s;&s;age in a Mask writ by <HI>Milton,</HI> where two Brothers are introduced &s;eek|ing
<PB N="300" REF="305">
after their Si&s;ter, whom they had lo&s;t in a dark Night and thick Wood. One of the Bro|thers is apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the wandering Virgin &s;hould be overpowered with Fears through the Darkne&s;s and Loneline&s;s of the Time and Place. This gives the other Occa&s;ion to make the fol|lowing Reflections, which, as I read them, made me forget my Age, and renewed in me the warm De&s;ires after Virtue, &s;o natural to uncorrupted Youth.</P>
<Q><L>I do not think my Si&s;ter &s;o to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</L>
<L>Or &s;o unprincipled in Virtue's Book,</L>

<L>(Not being in Danger, as I tru&s;t &s;he is not)</L>
<L>Could &s;tir the con&s;tant Mood of her calm Thoughts,</L>
<L>And put them into misbecoming Plight.</L>
<L>Virtue could &s;ee to do what Virtue would,</L>
<L>By her own radiant Light, tho' Sun and Moon</L>
<L>Were in the flat Sea &s;unk. And Wi&s;dom's &s;elf</L>
<L>Oft &s;eeks to &s;weet retired Solitude:</L>
<L>Where, with her be&s;t Nur&s;e, Contemplation,</L>
<L>She plumes her Feathers, and lets grow her Wings,</L>
<L>That in the various Bu&s;tle of Re&s;ort</L>
<L>Were all too ruffled, and &s;ometimes impaired.</L>
<L>He that has Light within his own clear Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>May &s;it i'th' Center, and enjoy bright Day:</L>

<P>I Have been this Evening recollecting what Pa&s;|&s;ages (&s;ince I could fir&s;t think) have left the &s;tronge&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions upon my Mind; and after &s;trict Enquiry, I am convinced, that the Impul&s;es I have received from Theatrical Repre&s;entations, have had a greater Effect, than otherwi&s;e would have been wrought in me by the little Occurren|ces of my private Life. My old Friends, <HI>Hart</HI> and <HI>Mohun;</HI> the one by his natural and proper Force, the other by his great Skill and Art, never failed to &s;end me Home full of &s;uch Idea's as affected my Behaviour, and made me in&s;en&s;ibly more courteous and humane to my Friends and Ac|quaintance. It is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a good Play to make every Man an Hero; but it certainly gives him a livelier Sen&s;e of Virtue and Merit than he had when he entered the Theatre.</P>
<P>This rational Plea&s;ure (as I always call it) has for many Years been very little ta&s;ted: But I am glad to find, that the true Spirit of it is reviving again among&s;t us, by a due Regard to what is pre&s;ented, and by &s;upporting only one Playhou&s;e. It has been within the Ob&s;ervation of the younge&s;t among&s;t us, That while there were Two Hou&s;es, they did not outvie each o|ther by &s;uch Repre&s;entations as tended to the In|&s;truction and Ornament of Life, but by introdu|cing mimical Dances, and ful&s;ome Buffoonries. For when an excellent Tragedy was to be acted
<PB N="302" REF="307">
in one Hou&s;e, the Ladder-Dancer carried the whole Town to the other: And indeed &s;uch an Evil as this, mu&s;t be the natural Con&s;equence of Two Theatres, as certainly as that there are more who can &s;ee than can think. Every one is &s;en&s;ible of the Danger of the Fellow on the Lad|der, and can &s;ee his Activity in coming down &s;afe; but very few are Judges of the Di&s;tre&s;s of an Hero in a Play, or of his Manner of Behaviour in tho&s;e Circum&s;tances. Thus, to plea&s;e the People, Two Hou&s;es mu&s;t entertain them with what they can under&s;tand, and not with Things which are de&s;ign|ed to improve their Under&s;tanding: And the rea|die&s;t Way to gain good Audiences, mu&s;t be to of|fer &s;uch Things as are mo&s;t reli&s;hed by the Crowd; that is to &s;ay, immode&s;t Action, empty Show, or impertinent Activity. In &s;hort, Two Hou&s;es can|not hope to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but by Means which are con|tradictory to the very In&s;titution of a Theatre in a well-govern'd Kingdom.</P>
<P>I have ever had this Sen&s;e of the Thing, and for that Rea&s;on have rejoiced that my ancient coeval Friend of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> though he had &s;old off mo&s;t of his Moveables, &s;till kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Palace, and trembled for him, when he had lately like to have been taken by a Stratagem. There have for many Ages been a certain Learn|ed Sort of Unlearned Men in this Nation called Attornies, who have taken upon them to &s;olve all Difficulties by increa&s;ing them, and are called upon to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all who are lazy, or weak of Under&s;tanding. The In&s;olence of a Ruler of this Place made him re&s;ign the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it to the Management of my above-mentioned Friend <HI>Divito. Divito</HI> was too Mode&s;t to know when to re&s;ign it, till he had the Opinion and Sentence of the Law for his Removal. Both the&s;e in Length of Time were obtained again&s;t him: But as the great <HI>Archimedes</HI> defended <HI>Sy|racu&s;e</HI> with &s;o powerful Engines, that if he threw
<PB N="303" REF="308">
a Rope or Piece of Wood over the Wall, the E|nemy fled; &s;o <HI>Divito</HI> had wounded all Adver&s;a|ries with &s;o much Skill, that Men feared even to be in the Right again&s;t him. For this Rea&s;on, the lawful Ruler &s;ets up an Attorney to expel an Attorney, and cho&s;e a Name dreadful to the Stage, who only &s;eemed able to beat <HI>Divito</HI> out of his Intrenchments.</P>
<P>On the 22d In&s;tant, a Night of publick Re|joycing, the Enemies of <HI>Divito</HI> made a Large&s;s to the People of Faggots, Tubs, and other Com|bu&s;tible Matter, which was erected into a Bon|fire before the Palace. Plentiful Cans were at the &s;ame Time di&s;tributed among the Dependen|ces of that Principality; and the artful Rival of <HI>Divito</HI> ob&s;erving them prepared for Enterprize, pre&s;ented the lawful Owner of the neighbouring Edifice, and &s;howed his Deputation under him. War immediately en&s;ued upon the peaceful Em|pire of Wit and the Mu&s;es; the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Van|dals</HI> &s;acking <HI>Rome</HI> did not threaten a more bar|barous Deva&s;tation of Arts and Sciences. But when they had forced their Entrance, the expe|rienced <HI>Divito</HI> had detached all his Subjects, and evacuated all his Stores. The neighbouring Inhabitants report, That the Refu&s;e of <HI>Divito</HI>'s Followers marched off the Night before di&s;gui&s;ed in Magnificence; Door-Keepers came out clad like Cardinals, and Scene Drawers like Heathen Gods. <HI>Divito</HI> him&s;elf was wrapped up in one of his black Clouds, and left to the Enemy nothing but any empty Stage, full of Trap-Doors, known only to him&s;elf and his Adherents.</P>

<P>I Was la&s;t Week taking a &s;olitary Walk in the Garden of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> (a Favour that is in|dulged me by &s;everal of the Benchers who are my intimate Friends, and grown old with me in this Neighbourhood) when, according to the Nature of Men in Years, who have made but little Pro|gre&s;s in the Advancement of their Fortune or their Fame, I was repining at the &s;udden Ri&s;e of many Per&s;ons who are my Juniors, and indeed at the unequal Di&s;tribution of Wealth, Honour, and all other Ble&s;&s;ings of Life. I was lo&s;t in this Thought when the Night came upon me, and drew my Mind into a far more agreeable Con|templation. The Heaven above me appeared in all its Glories, and pre&s;ented me with &s;uch an Hemi&s;phere of Stars, as made the mo&s;t agreea|ble Pro&s;pect imaginable to one who delights in the Study of Nature. It happened to be a freez|ing Night, which had purified the whole Body of Air into &s;uch a bright tran&s;parent Aether, as made every Con&s;tellation vi&s;ible; and at the &s;ame Time gave &s;uch a particular Glowing to the Stars, that I thought it the riche&s;t Sky I had ever &s;een. I could not behold a Scene &s;o won|derfully adorned and lighted up, (if I may be al|lowed
<PB N="307" REF="312">
that Expre&s;&s;ion) without &s;uitable Medita|tions on the Author of &s;uch illu&s;trious and ama|&s;ing Objects. For on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, Philo&s;ophy &s;ugge&s;ts Motives to Religion, and Religion adds Plea&s;ures to Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had recovered my u&s;ual Temper and Serenity of Soul, I retired to my Lodgings with the Satisfaction of having pa&s;&s;ed away a few Hours in the proper Employments of a rea&s;onable Creature, and promi&s;ing my &s;elf that my Slum|bers would be &s;weet. I no &s;ooner fell into them, but I dreamed a Dream, or &s;aw a Vi&s;ion (for I know not which to call it) that &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of my Evening-Meditation, and had &s;omething in it &s;o &s;olemn and &s;erious, that I cannot forbear communicating it; tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Wild|ne&s;s of Imagination (which in a Dream is al|ways loo&s;e and irregular) di&s;covers it &s;elf too much in &s;everal Parts of it.</P>
<P>Methoughts I &s;aw the &s;ame Azure Sky diver&s;ifi|ed with the &s;ame glorious Luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell a&s;leep. I was looking very attentively on that Sign in the Hea|vens which is called by the Name of the <HI>Ballance,</HI> when on a &s;udden there appear'd in it an extraor|dinary Light, as if the Sun &s;hould ri&s;e at Midnight. By its increa&s;ing in Breadth and Lu&s;tre, I &s;oon found that it approached towards the Earth; and at length could di&s;cern &s;omething like a Shadow hovering in the Mid&s;t of a great Glory, which in a little Time after I di&s;tinctly perceived to be the Fi|gure of a Woman. I fancied at fir&s;t it might have been the Angel, or Intelligence that guided the Con|&s;tellation from which it de&s;cended; but upon a near|er View, I &s;aw about her all the Emblems with which the Godde&s;s of Ju&s;tice is u&s;ually de&s;crib'd. Her Countenance was un&s;peakably awful and ma|je&s;tick, but exqui&s;itely beautiful to tho&s;e who&s;e Eyes were &s;trong enough to behold it; her Smiles tran&s;ported with Rapture, her Frowns terrified

to De&s;pair. She held in her Hand a Mirror, en|dowed with the &s;ame Qualities as that which the Painters put into the Hand of <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>There &s;treamed from it a Light, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed it &s;elf from all the Splendors that &s;ur|rounded her, more than a Fla&s;h of Lightning &s;hines in the Mid&s;t of Day-light. As &s;he moved it in her Hand, it brightened the Heavens, the Air, or the Earth. When &s;he had de&s;cended &s;o low as to be &s;een and heard by Mortals, to make the Pomp of her Appearance more &s;upportable, &s;he threw Darkne&s;s and Clouds about her, that tempered the Light into a Thou&s;and beautiful Shades and Colours, and multiplied that Lu&s;tre, which was before too &s;trong and dazling, into a Variety of milder Glories.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the World was in an Alarm, and all the Inhabitants of it gathered together upon a &s;pacious Plain; &s;o that I &s;eemed to have the whole Species before my Eyes. A Voice was heard from the Clouds, declaring the Intention of this Vi&s;it, which was, to re&s;tore and appropri|ate to every one living what was his Due. The Fear and Hope, Joy and Sorrow, which appear|ed in that great A&s;&s;embly after this &s;olemn De|claration, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> not to be expre&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t E|dict was then pronounced, <HI>That all Titles and Claims to Riches and E&s;tates, or to any part of'em, &s;hould be immediately ve&s;ted in the rightful Own|er.</HI> Upon this, the Inhabitants of the Earth held up the In&s;truments of their Tenure, whe|ther in Parchment, Paper, Wax, or any other Form of Conveyance; and as the Godde&s;s moved the Mirror of Truth which &s;he held in her Hand, &s;o that the Light which flowed from it fell up|on the Multitude, they examined the &s;everal In|&s;truments by the Beams of it. The Rays of this Mirror had a particular Quality of &s;etting Fire to all Forgery and Fal&s;hood. The Blaze of Papers, the Melting of Seals, and Crackling of Parch|ments,
<PB N="309" REF="314">
made a very odd Scene. The Fire very often ran through two or three Lines only, and then &s;topped. Tho' I could not but ob&s;erve, that the Flame chiefly broke out among the Interli|neations and Codicils, the Light of the Mirror, as it was turned up and down, pierced into all the dark Corners and Rece&s;&s;es of the Univer&s;e, and by that Means detected many Writings and Records which had been hidden or buried by Time, Chance or De&s;ign. This occa&s;ioned a wonderful Revolution among the People. At the &s;ame Time, the Spoils of Extortion, Fraud and Robbery, with all the Fruits of Bribery and Cor|ruption, were thrown together into a prodigious Pile, that almo&s;t reached to the Clouds, and was called, <HI>The Mount of Re&s;titution;</HI> to which all in|jured Per&s;ons were invited to receive what be|longed to them.</P>
<P>One might &s;ee Crowds of People in tattered Garments come up, and changed Clothes with others that were dre&s;&s;ed with Lace and Embroi|dery. Several who were Plumbs, or very near it, became Men of moderate Fortunes; and many others, who were overgrown in Wealth and Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, had no more left than what they u&s;ual|ly &s;pent. What moved my Concern mo&s;t, was, to &s;ee a certain Street of the greate&s;t Credit in <HI>Europe</HI> from one End to the other become Bank|rupt.</P>
<P>The next Command was, for the whole Body of Mankind to &s;eparate them&s;elves into their pro|per Families; which was no &s;ooner done, but an Edict was i&s;&s;ued out, requiring all Children <HI>to repair to their True and Natural Fathers.</HI> This put a great Part of the A&s;&s;embly in Motion; for as the Mirror was moved over them, it in&s;pired every one with &s;uch a natural In&s;tinct, as dire|cted them to their real Parents. It was a very melancholy Spectacle to &s;ee the Fathers of very large Families become Childle&s;s, and Batchelors
<PB N="310" REF="315">
undone by a Charge of Sons and Daughters. You might &s;ee a Pre&s;umptive Heir of a great E&s;tate ask Ble&s;&s;ing of his Coachman, and a celebrated Toa&s;t paying her Duty to a <HI>Valet de Chambre.</HI> Many under Vows of Celibacy appeared &s;urroun|ded with a numerous I&s;&s;ue. This Change of Pa|rentage would have cau&s;ed great Lamentation, but that the Calamity was pretty common; and that generally tho&s;e who lo&s;t their Children, had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing them put into the Hands of their deare&s;t Friends. Men were no &s;ooner &s;ettled in their Right to their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and their Progeny, but there was a Third Order proclaimed, <HI>That all the Po&s;ts of Dignity and Honour in the Univer&s;e &s;hould be conferred on Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Merit, Abilities and Per|fection.</HI> The Hand&s;ome, the Strong, and the Wealthy, immediately pre&s;&s;ed forward; but not being able to bear the Splendor of the Mirror which played upon their Faces, they immediate|ly fell back among the Crowd: But as the God|de&s;s tried the Multitude by her Gla&s;s, as the Ea|gle does its young Ones by the Lu&s;tre of the Sun, it was remarkable, that every one turned away his Face from it who had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf either by Virtue, Knowledge, or Capacity in Bu&s;ine&s;s, either Military or Civil. This Select A&s;&s;embly was drawn up in the Centre of a pro|digious Multitude, which was diffu&s;ed on all Sides, and &s;tood ob&s;erving them, as idle People u&s;e to gather about a Regiment that are exerci|&s;ing their Arms. They were drawn up in Three Bodies: In the Fir&s;t, were the Men of Virtue; in the Second, Men of Knowledge; and in the Third, the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s. It was impo&s;&s;ible to look at the fir&s;t Column without a &s;ecret Vene|ration, their A&s;pects were &s;o &s;weetned with Hu|manity, rai&s;ed with Contemplation, embolden|ed with Re&s;olution, and adorned with the mo&s;t agreeable Airs, which are tho&s;e that proceed
<PB N="311" REF="316">
from &s;ecret Habits of Virtue. I could not but take Notice, That there were many Faces among them which were unknown, not only to the Mul|titude, but even to &s;everal of their own Body.</P>
<P>In the Second Column, con&s;i&s;ting of the Men of Knowledge, there had been great Di&s;putes be|fore they fell into the Ranks, which they did not do at la&s;t, without the po&s;itive Command of the Godde&s;s who pre&s;ided over the A&s;&s;embly. She had &s;o ordered it, that Men of the greate&s;t Genius and &s;tronge&s;t Sen&s;e were placed at the Head of the Column: Behind the&s;e, were &s;uch as had formed their Minds very much on the Thoughts and writings of others. In the Rear of the Column, were Men who had more Wit than Sen&s;e, or more Learning than Under&s;tand|ing. All living Authors of any Value were rang|ed in one of the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a great Body of Editors, Criticks, Commentators and Gramma|rians, meet with &s;o very ill a Reception. They had formed them&s;elves into a Body, and with a great deal of Arrogance demanded the fir&s;t Sta|tion in the Column of Knowledge; but the God|de&s;s, in&s;tead of complying with their Reque&s;t, clapped them all into Liveries, and bid them know them&s;elves for no other but Lacques of the Learned.</P>
<P>The Third Column were Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ting of Per&s;ons in Military and Civil Capa|cities. The former marched out from the re&s;t, and placed them&s;elves in the Front; at which the o|ther &s;hook their Heads at them, but did not think fit to di&s;pute the Po&s;t with them. I could not but make &s;everal Ob&s;ervations upon this la&s;t Co|lumn of People; but I have certain private Rea|&s;ons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the Publick. In order to fill up all the Po&s;ts of Honour, Dignity, and Profit, there was a Draught made out of each Column of Men, who
<PB N="312" REF="317">
were Ma&s;ters of all Three Qualifications in &s;ome Degree, and were preferred to Stations of the fir&s;t Rank. The &s;econd Draught was made out of &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any Two of the Quali|fications, who were di&s;po&s;ed of in Stations of a &s;econd Dignity. Tho&s;e who were left, and were endowed only with one of them, had their &s;ui|table Po&s;ts. When this was over, there remain|ed many Places of Tru&s;t and Profit unfilled, for which there were fre&s;h Draughts made out of the &s;urrounding Multitude, who had any Appear|ance of the&s;e Excellencies, or were recommended by tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in Reality.</P>
<P>All were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many new Faces in the mo&s;t eminent Dignities; and for my own Part, I was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee that all my Friends either kept their pre&s;ent Po&s;ts, or were advanced to higher.</P>
<P>Having filled my Paper with tho&s;e Particulars of my Vi&s;ion which concern the Male Part of Mankind, I mu&s;t re&s;erve for another Occa&s;ion the Sequel of it, which relates to the Fair Sex.</P>

<P>THE Progre&s;s of my intended Account of what happened when <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> vi&s;ited Mor|tals, is at pre&s;ent interrupted by the Ob&s;ervation and Sen&s;e of an Inju&s;tice again&s;t which there is no Remedy, even in a Kingdom more happy in the Care taken of the Liberty and Property of
<PB N="313" REF="318">
the Subject, than any other Nation upon Earth This Inquiry is committed by a mo&s;t impregnable Set of Mortals, Men who are Rogues within the Law; and in the very Commi&s;&s;ion of what they are guilty of, profe&s;&s;edly own, that they forbear no Injury but from the Terror of being puni&s;hed for it. The&s;e Mi&s;creants are a Set of Wretches we Authors call Pirates, who print any Book, Poem, or Sermon, as &s;oon as it appears in the World, in a &s;maller Volume, and &s;ell it (as all other Thieves do &s;tolen Goods) at a cheaper Rate. I was in my Rage calling them Ra&s;cals, Plunderers, Robbers, Highwaymen-But they acknowledge all that, and are plea&s;ed with tho&s;e, as well as any other Titles, nay, will print them them&s;elves to turn the Penny.</P>
<P>I am extremely at a Lo&s;s how to act again&s;t &s;uch open Enemies, who have not Shame enough to be touched with our Reproaches, and are as well defended again&s;t what we can &s;ay, as what we can do. Railing therefore we mu&s;t turn into Complaint, which I cannot forbear making, when I con&s;ider that all the Labours of my long Life may be di&s;appointed by the fir&s;t Man that plea&s;es to rob me. I had flattered my &s;elf, that my Stock of Learning was worth 150 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> which would very hand&s;omely maintain me and my little Family, who are &s;o happy or &s;o wi&s;e as to want only Nece&s;&s;aries. Before Men had come up to this bare-faced Impudence, it was an E&s;tate to have a Competency of Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>An ingenious Drole, who is &s;ince dead, (and indeed it is well for him he is &s;o, for he mu&s;t have &s;tarved had he lived to this Day) u&s;ed to give me an Account of his good Husbandry in the Management of his Learning. He was a general Dealer, and had his Amu&s;ements as well comical as &s;erious. The merry Rogue &s;aid, when he wanted a Dinner, he writ a Paragraph of <HI>Table-Talk,</HI> and his Book&s;eller upon Sight paid the Recko|ning. He was a very good Judge of what would
<PB N="314" REF="319">
plea&s;e the People, and could aptly hit both the Genius of his Readers, and the Sea&s;on of the Year in his Writings. His Brain, which was his E&s;tate, had as regular and different Produce as other Mens Land. From the Beginning of <HI>No|vember</HI> till the Opening of the Campaigne, he writ Pamphlets and Letters to Members of Par|liament, or Friends in the Country. But &s;ome|times he would relieve his ordinary Readers with a Murder, and lived comfortably a Week or Two upon <HI>&s;trange and lamentable Accidents.</HI> A little before the Armies took the Field, his Way was to open your Attention with a Prodigy; and a Mon|&s;ter well writ, was Two Guinea's the lowe&s;t Price. This prepared his Readers for <HI>his Great and Bloody News</HI> from <HI>Flanders</HI> in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> Poor <HI>Tom!</HI> He is gone&mdash;But I ob&s;erved, he always looked well after a Battle, and was apparently fatter in a fighting Year. Had this hone&s;t carele&s;s Fellow lived till now, Famine had &s;tared him in the Face, and interrupted his Merriment; as it mu&s;t be a &s;olid Affliction to all tho&s;e who&s;e Pen is their Por|tion. As for my Part, I do not &s;peak wholly for my own Sake in this Point; for Palmi&s;try and A|&s;trology will bring me in greater Gains than the&s;e my Papers; &s;o that I am only in the Condition of a Lawyer, who leaves the Bar for Chamber-Pra|ctice. However, I may be allowed to &s;peak in the Cau&s;e of Learning it &s;elf, and lament, that a liberal Education is the only one which a polite Nation makes unprofitable. All Mechanick Arti|zans are allowed to reap the Fruit of their Inven|tion and Ingenuity without Inva&s;ion; but he that has &s;eparated him&s;elf from the re&s;t of Mankind, and &s;tudied the Wonders of the Creation, the Government of his Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Revolutions of the World, and has an Ambition to commu|nicate the Effect of half his Life &s;pent in &s;uch noble Enquiries, has no Property in what he is willing to produce, but is expo&s;ed to Robbery and
<PB N="315" REF="320">
Want, with this melancholy and ju&s;t Reflection, That he is the only Man who is not protected by his Country, at the &s;ame Time that he be&s;t de|&s;erves it. According to the ordinary Rules of Computation, the greater the Adventure is, the greater ought to be the Profit of tho&s;e who &s;uc|ceed in it; and by this Mea&s;ure, none have Pre|tence of turning their Labours to greater Advan|tage than Per&s;ons brought up to Letters. A lear|ned Education, pa&s;&s;ing through great Schools and Univer&s;ities, is very expen&s;ive, and con&s;umes a moderate Fortune, before it is gone through in its proper Forms. The Purcha&s;e of an hand&s;ome Commi&s;&s;ion or Employment, which would give a Man a good Figure in another Kind of Life, is to be made at a much cheaper Rate. Now, if we con&s;ider this expen&s;ive Voyage which is under|taken in the Search of Knowledge, and how few there are who take in any con&s;iderable Merchan|di&s;e, how le&s;s frequent it is to be able to turn what Men have gained into Profit? How hard is it, that the very &s;mall Number who are di|&s;tingui&s;hed with Abilities to know how to vend their Wares, and have the good Fortune to bring them into Port, &s;hould &s;uffer being plunder'd by Privateers under the very Cannon that &s;hould pro|tect them? The mo&s;t eminent and u&s;eful Author of the Age we live in, after having laid out a Princely Revenue in Works of Charity and Bene|ficence, as became the Greatne&s;s of his Mind, and the Sanctity of his Character, would have left the Per&s;on in the World who was the deare&s;t to him in a narrow Condition, had not the Sale of his immortal Writings brought her in a very con&s;ide|rable Dowry; though it was impo&s;&s;ible for it to be equal to their Value. Every one will know, that I here mean the Works of the late Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Copy of which was &s;old for a 500 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="321">
I do not &s;peak with relation to any Party; but it has happened, and may often &s;o happen, that Men of great Learning and Virtue cannot qualify them&s;elves for being employed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, or re|ceiving Preferments. In this Ca&s;e, you cut them off from all Support, if you take from them the Benefit that may ari&s;e from their Writings. For my own Part, I have brought my &s;elf to con&s;ider Things in &s;o unprejudiced a Manner, that I e&s;teem more a Man who can live by the Products of his Under&s;tanding, than One who does it by the Fa|vour of Great Men.</P>
<P>The Zeal of an Author has tran&s;ported me thus far, though I think my &s;elf as much concerned in the Capacity of a Reader. If this Practice goes on, we mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee again a beautiful Edition of a Book in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>We have already &s;een the Memoirs of Sir <HI>Wil|liam Temple</HI> publi&s;hed in the &s;ame Character and Volume with the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tom Thumb,</HI> and the Works of our greate&s;t Poets &s;hrunk into Penny Books and Garlands. For my own Part, I expect to &s;ee my Lucubrations printed on Brown|er Paper than they are at pre&s;ent; and, if the Humour continues, mu&s;t be forced to retrench my expen&s;ive Way of Living, and not &s;moke a|bove Two Pipes a Day.</P>

<HEAD>A Continuation of the Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Male World were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the God|de&s;s of Ju&s;tice, and di&s;appeared, when on a &s;udden the whole Plain was covered with Wo|men. So charming a Multitude filled my Heart with un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure; and as the Cele&s;tial Light of the Mirror &s;hone upon their Faces, &s;e|veral of them &s;eemed rather Per&s;ons that de&s;cen|ded in the Train of the Godde&s;s, than &s;uch who were brought before her to their Tryal. The Clack of Tongues, and Confu&s;ion of Voices, in this new A&s;&s;embly, was &s;o very great, that the Godde&s;s was forced to command Silence &s;everal Times, and with &s;ome Severity, before &s;he could make them attentive to her Edicts. They were all &s;en&s;ible, that the mo&s;t important Affair among Woman kind was then to be &s;ettled, which every one knows to be the Point of Place. This had rai&s;ed innumerable Di&s;putes among them, and put the whole Sex into a Tumult. Every one produced her Claim, and pleaded her Preten|&s;ions. Birth, Beauty, Wit, or Wealth, were Words that rung in my Ears from all Parts of the Plain. Some boa&s;ted of the Merit of their Husbands; others of their own Power in govern|ing them. Some pleaded their un&s;potted Virginity; others their numerous I&s;&s;ue. Some valued them|&s;elves
<PB N="319" REF="324">
as they were the Mothers, and others, as they were the Daughters, of con&s;iderable Per&s;ons. There was not a &s;ingle Accompli&s;hment unmen|tioned, or unpracti&s;ed. The whole Congrega|tion was full of Singing, Dancing, To&s;&s;ing, O|gling, Squeaking, Smiling, Sighing, Fanning, Frowning, and all tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible Arts which Women put in Practice, to captivate the Hearts of rea&s;onable Creatures. The Godde&s;s, to end this Di&s;pute, cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed, That every one &s;hould take Place according as &s;he was more or le&s;s beautiful. This Declaration gave great Satisfaction to the whole A&s;&s;embly, which immediately bridled up, and appeared in all its Beauties. Such as believed them&s;elves graceful in their Motion, found an Occa&s;ion of falling back, advancing forward, or making a fal&s;e Step, that they might &s;how their Per&s;ons in the mo&s;t becoming Air. Such as had fine Necks and Bo&s;oms, were wonderfully curious to look over the Heads of the Multitude, and ob|&s;erve the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the A&s;&s;embly. Several clapped their Hands on their Foreheads, as helping their Sight to look upon the Glories that &s;urrounded the Godde&s;s, but in Reality to &s;how fine Hands and Arms. The Ladies were yet better plea&s;ed, when they heard, that in the Deci&s;ion of this great Controver&s;y, each of them &s;hould be her own Judge, and take her Place according to her own Opinion of her &s;elf, when &s;he con&s;ulted her Looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Godde&s;s then let down the Mirror of Truth in a Golden Chain, which appeared lar|ger in Proportion as it de&s;cended and approached nearer to the Eyes of the Beholders. It was the particular Propriety of this Looking-gla&s;s to ba|ni&s;h all fal&s;e Appearances, and &s;how People what they are. The whole Woman was repre|&s;ented, without Regard to the u&s;ual external Features, which were made entirely conformable
<PB N="320" REF="325">
to their real Characters. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t ac+compli&s;hed (taking in the whole Circle of Fe+male Perfections) were the mo&s;t beautiful; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t defective, the mo&s;t deformed. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Godde&s;s &s;o varied the Motion of the Gla&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and placed it in &s;o many different Lights, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> each had an Opportunity of &s;eeing her &s;elf in it.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Rage, the Plea|&s;ure, or A&s;toni&s;hment, that appeared in each Face upon its Repre&s;ention in the Mirror: Mul|titudes &s;tarted at their own Form, and would have broke the Gla&s;s if they could have reached it. Many &s;aw their Blooming Features wither as they looked upon them, and their Self Ad|miration turned into a Loathing and Abhorrence. The Lady who was thought &s;o agreeable in her Anger, and was &s;o often celebrated for a Wo|man of Fire and Spirit, was frighted at her own Image, and fancied &s;he &s;aw a Fury in the Gla&s;s. The intere&s;ted Mi&s;tre&s;s beheld a Harpy, and the &s;ubtile Jilt a Sphinx. I was very much troubled in my own Heart, to &s;ee &s;uch a De&s;truction of fine Faces; but at the &s;ame Time had the Plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;everal improved, which I had before looked upon as the greate&s;t Ma&s;ter-pieces of Nature. I ob&s;erved, that &s;ome few were &s;o humble as to be &s;urpri&s;ed at their own Charms; and that many a one, who had lived in the Re|tirement and Severity of a Ve&s;tal, &s;hined forth in all the Graces and Attractions of a Syren. I was ravi&s;hed at the Sight of a particular Image in the Mirror, which I think the mo&s;t beautiful Object that my Eyes ever beheld. There was &s;omething more than Humane in her Counte|nance: Her Eyes were &s;o full of Light, that they &s;eemed to beautify every Thing they looked up|on. Her Face was enlivened with &s;uch a florid Bloom, as did not &s;o properly &s;eem the Mark of Health, as of Immortality. Her Shape, he Sta|ture,
<PB N="321" REF="326">
and her Mien, were &s;uch as di&s;tingui&s;h'd her even there where the whole Fair Sex was a&s;|&s;embled.</P>
<P>I was impatient to &s;ee the Lady repre&s;ented by &s;o divine an Image, whom I found to be the Per|&s;on that &s;tood at my Right Hand, and in the &s;ame Point of View with my &s;elf. This was a little old Woman, who in her Prime had been about Five Foot high, though at pre&s;ent &s;hrunk to about Three Quarters of that Mea&s;ure: Her na|tural A&s;pect was puckered up with Wrinkles, and her Head covered with grey Hairs. I had ob&s;erved all along an innocent Chearfulne&s;s in her Face, which was now heighten'd into Rap|ture as &s;he beheld her &s;elf in the Gla&s;s. It was an odd Circum&s;tance in my Dream (but I cannot forbear relating it); I conceived &s;o great an In|clination towards her, that I had Thoughts of di&s;cour&s;ing her upon the Point of Marriage, when on a &s;udden &s;he was carried from me; for the Word was now given, that all who were plea&s;ed with their own Images, &s;hould &s;eparate, and place them&s;elves at the Head of their Sex.</P>
<P>This Detachment was afterwards divided into Three Bodies, con&s;i&s;ting of Maids, Wives and Widows; the Wives being placed in the Middle, with the Maids on the Right, and Widows on the Left; though it was with Difficulty that the&s;e Two la&s;t Bodies were hinder'd from falling into the Centre. This Separation of tho&s;e who liked their real &s;elves, not having le&s;&s;ened the Number of the main Body &s;o con&s;iderably as it might have been wi&s;hed, the Godde&s;s, after ha|ving drawn up her Mirror, thought fit to make new Di&s;tinctions among tho&s;e who did not like the Figure which they &s;aw in it. She made &s;e|veral whole&s;ome Edicts, which are &s;lipt out of my Mind; but there were Two which dwelt upon me, as being very extraordinary in their Kind, and executed with great Severity. Their
<PB N="322" REF="327">
De&s;ign was, to make an Example of Two Ex|tremes in the Female World; of tho&s;e who are very &s;evere on the Conduct of others, and of tho&s;e who are very regardle&s;s of their own. The fir&s;t Sentence therefore the Godde&s;s pronounced, was, That all Females addicted to Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s and Detra|ction, &s;hould lo&s;e the U&s;e of Speech; a Puni&s;h|ment which would be the mo&s;t grievous to the Offender, and (what &s;hould be the End of all Puni&s;hments) effectual for rooting out the Crime. Upon this Edict, which was as &s;oon executed as publi&s;hed, the Noi&s;e of the A&s;&s;embly very con|&s;iderably abated. It was a melancholy Spectacle, to &s;ee &s;o many who had the Reputation of rigid Virtue &s;truck dumb. A Lady who &s;tood by me, and &s;aw my Concern, told me, She wondered how I could be concerned for &s;uch a Pack of&mdash;I found, by the Shaking of her Head, &s;he was going to give me their Characters; but by her &s;aying no more, I perceived &s;he had lo&s;t the Command of her Tongue. This Calamity felt very heavy upon that Part of Women who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of <HI>Prudes,</HI> a Courtly Word for Female Hypocrites, who have a &s;hert Way to being virtuous, by &s;howing that others are vitious. The Second Sentence was then pro|nounced again&s;t the loo&s;e Part of the Sex, That all &s;hould immediately be pregnant, who in any Part of their Lives had ran the Hazard of it. This produced a very goodly Appearance, and revealed &s;o many Mi&s;conducts, that made tho&s;e who were lately &s;truck dumb, repine more than ever at their Want of Utterance; though at the &s;ame Time (as Afflictions &s;eldom come &s;ingle) many of the Mutes were al&s;o &s;eized with this new Calamity. The Ladies were now in &s;uch a Condition, that they would have wanted Room, had not the Plain been large enough to let them divide their Ground, and extend their Lines on all Sides. It was a &s;en&s;ible Affliction
<PB N="323" REF="328">
to me, to &s;ee &s;uch a Multitude of Fair Ones either dumb or big-bellied: But I was &s;omething more at Ea&s;e, when I found that they agreed upon &s;e|veral Regulations to cover &s;uch Misfortunes. A|mong others, that it &s;hould be an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim in all Nations, That a Woman's Fir&s;t Child might come into the World within Six Months after her Acquaintance with her Hu&s;|band; and that Grief might retard the Birth of her la&s;t till Fourteen Months after his De|cea&s;e.</P>
<P>This Vi&s;ion la&s;ted till my u&s;ual Hour of Wa|king, which I did with &s;ome Surpri&s;e, to find my &s;elf alone, after having been engaged al|mo&s;t a whole Night in &s;o prodigious a Multitude. I could not but reflect with Wonder, at the Par|tiality and Extravagance of my Vi&s;ion; which according to my Thoughts, has not done Ju|&s;tice to the Sex. If Virtue in Men is more Ve|nerable, it is in Women more Lovely; which <HI>Milton</HI> has very finely expre&s;&s;ed in his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> where <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Eve,</HI> after ha|ving a&s;&s;erted his own Pre-eminence, as being Fir&s;t in Creation and internal Faculties, breaks out into the following Rapture:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Yet when I approach</L>

<P>That your Petitioner having been bred up to a Cane from his Youth, it is now become as nece&s;&s;ary to him as any other of his Limbs.</P>

<P>Upon the hearing of his Ca&s;e, I was touched with &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion, and the more &s;o, when upon ob&s;erving him nearer I found he was a <HI>Prig,</HI> I bid him produce his Cane in Court, which he had left at the Door. He did &s;o, and I finding it to be very curiou&s;ly clouded, with a tran&s;pa|rent
<PB N="326" REF="331">
Amber Head, and a blue Ribbon to hang upon his Wri&s;t, I immediately ordered my Clerk <HI>Lillie</HI> to lay it up, and deliver out to him a plain Joint headed with Walnut; and then, in order to wean him from it by Degrees, permitted him to wear it Three Days in the Week, and to abate proportionably till he found him&s;elf able to go alone.</P>
<P>The Second who appeared, came limping into the Court: And &s;etting forth in his Petition many Pretences for the U&s;e of a Cane, I cau&s;ed them to be examined one by one; but finding him in different Stories, and confronting him with &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es who had &s;een him walk upright, I ordered Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> to take in his Cane, and rejected his Petition as frivolous.</P>
<P>A Third made his Entry with great Difficulty, leaning upon a &s;light Stick, and in Danger of falling every Step he took. I &s;aw the Weakne&s;s of his Hams; and hearing that he had married a young Wife about a Fortnight before, I bid him leave his Cane, and gave him a new Pair of Crutches, with which he went off in great Vi|gour and Alacrity. This Gentleman was &s;ucceed|ed by another, who &s;eemed very much plea&s;ed while his Petition was reading, in which he had repre&s;ented, That he was extremely afflicted with the Gout, and &s;et his Foot upon the Ground with the Caution and Dignity which accompany that Di&s;temper. I &s;u&s;pected him for an Impo&s;tor, and having ordered him to be &s;earched, I com|mitted him into the Hands of Dr. <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> (my own Corn-Cutter) who atten|ded in an outward Room, and wrought &s;o &s;pee|dy a Cure upon him, that I thought fit to &s;end him al&s;o away without his Cane.</P>
<P>While I was thus di&s;pen&s;ing Ju&s;tice, I heard a Noi&s;e in my outward Room; and enquiring what was the Occa&s;ion of it, my Door-Keeper told me, that they had taken up one in the very
<PB N="327" REF="332">
Fact as he was pa&s;&s;ing by my Door. They im|mediately brought in a lively fre&s;h-coloured young Man, who made great Re&s;i&s;tance with Hand and Foot, but did not offer to make U&s;e of his Cane, which hung upon his Fifth Button. Upon Examination, I found him to be an <HI>Oxford</HI> Scholar, who was ju&s;t entered at the <HI>Temple.</HI> He at fir&s;t di&s;puted the Juri&s;diction of the Court; but being driven out of his little Law and Lo|gick, he told me very pertly, That he looked upon &s;uch a prependicular Creature as Man to make a very imperfect Figure without a Cane in his Hand. It is well known (&s;ays he) we ought, according to the natural Situation of our Bodies, to walk upon our Hands and Feet; and that the Wi&s;dom of the Ancients had de&s;cribed Man to be an Animal of Four Legs in the Morning, Two at Noon, and Three at Night; by which they intimated, that a Cane might very properly be|come Part of us in &s;ome Period of Life. Upon which I asked him, Whether he wore it at his Brea&s;t to have it in Readine&s;s when that Period &s;hould arrive? My young Lawyer immediately told me, He had a Property in it, and a Right to hang it where he plea&s;ed, and to make U&s;e of it as he thought fit, provided that he did not break the Peace with it: And further &s;aid, That he never took it off his Button, unle&s;s it were to lift it up at a Coachman, hold it over the Head of a Drawer, point out the Circum&s;tances of a Story, or for other Services of the like Na|ture, that are all within the Laws of the Land. I did not care for di&s;couraging a young Man, who, I &s;aw, would come to Good; and becau&s;e his Heart was &s;et upon his new Purcha&s;e, I only or|dered him to wear it about his Neck, in&s;tead of hanging it upon his Button, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. There were &s;everal appeared in Court, who&s;e Preten&s;ions I found to be very good, and there|fore gave them their Licences upon paying their
<PB N="328" REF="333">
Fees; as many others had their Licences re|newed, who required more Time for Recovery of their Lamene&s;s than I had before allowed them.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patch'd this Set of my Petitioners, there came in a well-dre&s;&s;ed Man, with a Gla&s;s-Tube in one Hand, and his Petition in the other. Upon his entring the Room, he threw back the Right Side of his Wig, put forward his Right Leg, and advancing the Gla&s;s to his Right Eye, aimed it directly at me. In the mean while, to make my Ob&s;ervations al&s;o, I put on my Specta|cles; in which Po&s;ture we &s;urvey'd each other for &s;ome Time. Upon the Removal of our Gla&s;|&s;es, I de&s;ired him to read his Petition, which he did very promptly and ea&s;ily; though at the &s;ame Time it &s;et forth, that he could &s;ee no|thing di&s;tinctly, and was within very few Degrees of being utterly blind; concluding with a Prayer, That he might be permitted to &s;trengthen and extend his Sight by a Gla&s;s. In An&s;wer to this I told him, he might &s;ometimes extend it to his own De&s;truction. As you are now, (&s;aid I) you are out of the Reach of Beauty; the Shafts of the fine&s;t Eyes lo&s;e their Force be|fore they can come at you; you can't di&s;tingui&s;h a Toa&s;t from an Orange-Wench; you can &s;ee a whole Circle of Beauty without any Interruption from an impertinent Face to di&s;compo&s;e you. In &s;hort, what are Snares for others&mdash;My Petitioner would hear no more, but told me very &s;eriou&s;ly, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you quite mi&s;take your Man; it is the Joy, the Plea&s;ure, the Em|ployment of my Life, to frequent publick A&s;&s;em|blies, and gaze upon the Fair. In a Word, I found his U&s;e of a Gla&s;s was occa&s;ion'd by no other In|firmity but his Vanity, and was not &s;o much de|&s;ign'd to make him &s;ee, as to make him be &s;een and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by others. I therefore refu&s;ed him a Licence for a Per&s;pective, but allow'd him a Pair
<PB N="329" REF="334">
of Spectacles, with full Permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e them in any publick A&s;&s;embly as he &s;hould think fit. He was followed by &s;o very few of this Order of Men, that I have Rea&s;on to hope this Sort of Cheats are almo&s;t at an End.</P>
<P>The Orange-Flower Men appeared next with Petitions, perfumed &s;o &s;trongly with Musk, that I was almo&s;t overcome with the Scent; and for my own Sake, was obliged forthwith to licen&s;e their Handkerchiefs, e&s;pecially when I found they had &s;weetened them at <HI>Charles Lillie</HI>'s, and that &s;ome of their Per&s;ons would not be altoge|ther inoffen&s;ive without them. <HI>John Morphew,</HI> whom I have made the General of my Dead Men, acquainted me, That the Petitioners were all of that Order, and could produce Certificates to prove it, if I requir'd it. I was &s;o well plea|&s;ed with this Way of their Embalming them|&s;elves, that I commanded the above&s;aid <HI>Morphew</HI> to give it in Orders to his whole Army, That every one who did not &s;urrender him&s;elf up to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Upholders, &s;hould u&s;e the &s;ame Method to keep him&s;elf &s;weet during his pre&s;ent State of Putrefaction.</P>
<P>I fini&s;hed my Se&s;&s;ion with great Content of Mind, reflecting upon the Good I had done; for however &s;lightly Men may regard the&s;e Particu|larities and little Follies in Dre&s;s and Behaviour, they lead to greater Evils. The bearing to be laughed at for &s;uch Singularities, teach us in|&s;en&s;ibly an impertinent Fortitude, and enable us to bear publick Cen&s;ure for Things which more &s;ub&s;tantially de&s;erve it. By this Means they open a Gate to Folly, and oftentimes render a Man &s;o ridiculous, as di&s;credit his Virtues and Capacities, and unqualify them from doing any Good in the World. Be&s;ides, the giving into un|common Habits of this Nature, is a Want of that humble Deference which is due to Man|kind and (what is wor&s;t of all) the certain In|dication
<PB N="330" REF="335">
of &s;ome &s;ecret Flaw in the Mind of the Per&s;on that commits them. When I was a young Man, I remember a Gentleman of great Integrity and Worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad Belt, and an Hanger in&s;tead of a fa&s;hionable Sword, though in all other Points a very well bred Man. I &s;u&s;pected him at fir&s;t Sight to have &s;omething wrong in him, but was not able for a long while to di&s;cover any colla|teral Proofs of it. I watched him narrowly for Six and thirty Years, when at la&s;t, to the Sur|prize of every Body but my &s;elf, who had long expected to &s;ee the Folly break out, he married his own Cook-Maid.</P>

<P>MY Brother <HI>Tranquillus</HI> being gone out of Town for &s;ome Days, my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny</HI> &s;ent me Word &s;he would come and dine with me, and therefore de&s;ired me to have no other Com|pany. I took Care accordingly, and was not a little plea&s;ed to &s;ee her enter the Room with a Decent and Matron-like Behaviour, which I thought very much became her. I &s;aw &s;he had a great deal to &s;ay to me, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered in her Eyes, and the Air of her Countenance, that &s;he had abundance of Satisfaction in her Heart, which &s;he longed to communicate. How|ever, I was re&s;olved to let her break into her Di&s;cour&s;e her own Way, and reduced her to a
<PB N="331" REF="336">
Thou&s;and little Devices and Intimations to bring me to the Mention of her Husband. But find|ing I was re&s;olved not to name him, &s;he began of her own Accord; My Husband (&s;aid &s;he) gives his humble Service to you: To which I only an&s;wered, I hope he is well; and without waiting for a Reply, fell into other Subjects. She at la&s;t was out of all Patience, and &s;aid, (with a Smile and Manner that I thought had more Beauty and Spirit than I had ever ob&s;erved before in her) I did not think, Brother, you had been &s;o ill-natured. You have &s;een, ever &s;ince I came in, that I had a Mind to talk of my Husband, and you won't be &s;o kind as to give me an Occa&s;ion. I did not know (&s;aid I) but it might be a di&s;agreeable Subject to you. You do not take me for &s;o old-fa&s;hioned a Fellow as to think of entertaining a young Lady with the Di&s;cour&s;e of her Husband. I know, nothing is more acceptable than to &s;peak of one who is to be &s;o; but to &s;peak of one who is &s;o! Indeed, <HI>Jenny,</HI> I am a better bred Man than you think me. She &s;howed a little Di&s;like at my Raillery; and by her bridling up, I perceived &s;he expected to be treated hereafter not as <HI>Jenny Di&s;taff,</HI> but Mrs. <HI>Tranquillus.</HI> I was very well plea&s;ed with this Change in her Humour; and upon talking with her on &s;everal Subjects, I could not but fancy, that I &s;aw a great deal of her Husband's Way and Manner, in her Remarks, her Phra&s;es, the Tone of her Voice, and the very Air of her Countenance. This gave me an un&s;peakable Sa|tisfaction, not only becau&s;e I had found her an Husband, from whom &s;he could learn many Things that were laudable, but al&s;o becau&s;e I looked upon her Imitation of him as an infalli|ble Sign that &s;he intirely loved him. This is an Ob&s;ervation that I never knew fail, though I do not remember that any other has made it. The natural Shyne&s;s of her Sex hindered her from
<PB N="332" REF="337">
telling me the Greatne&s;s of her own Pa&s;&s;ion; but I ea&s;ily collected it, from the Repre&s;entation &s;he gave me of his. I have every Thing, &s;ays &s;he, in <HI>Tranquillus</HI> that I can wi&s;h for; and enjoy in him (what indeed you have told me were to be met with in a good Husband) the Fondne&s;s of a Lover, the Tenderne&s;s of a Parent, and the In|timacy of a Friend. It tran&s;ported me to &s;ee her Eyes &s;wimming in Tears of Affection when &s;he &s;poke: And is there not, Dear Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, more Plea&s;ure in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Man, than in all the little Impertinencies of Balls, A&s;|&s;emblies, and Equipage, which it co&s;t me &s;o much Pains to make you contemn? She an&s;wer'd, &s;miling, <HI>Tranquillus</HI> has made me a &s;incere Con|vert in a few Weeks, though I am afraid you could not have done it in your whole Life. To tell you truly, I have only one Fear hanging upon me, which is apt to give me Trouble in the Mid&s;t of all my Satisfactions: I am afraid, you mu&s;t know, that I &s;hall not always make the &s;ame amiable Appearance in his Eye that I do at pre&s;ent. You know, Brother <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> that you have the Reputation of a Conjurer; and if you have any one Secret in your Art to make your Si&s;ter always beautiful, I &s;hould be happier than if I were Mi&s;tre&s;s of all the Worlds you have &s;hown me in a Starry Night&mdash;<HI>Jenny,</HI> (&s;aid I) without having Recour&s;e to Magick, I &s;hall give you one plain Rule, that will not fail of making you always amiable to a Man who has &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion for you, and is of &s;o equal and rea&s;onable a Temper as <HI>Tranquillus.</HI> Endeavour to plea&s;e, and you mu&s;t plea&s;e; be always in the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition as you are when you ask for this Secret, and, you may take my Word, you will never want it. An inviolable Fidelity, good Humour, and Complacency of Temper out-live all the Charms of a fine Face, and make the De|cays of it invi&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="338">
We di&s;cour&s;ed very long upon this Head, which was equally agreeable to us both; for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, (as I tenderly love her) I take as much Plea&s;ure in giving her In&s;tructions for her Welfare as &s;he her &s;elf does in receiving them. I proceeded therefore to inculcate the&s;e Senti|ments, by relating a very particular Pa&s;&s;age that happened within my own Knowledge.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal of us making merry at a Friend's Hou&s;e in a Country Village, when the Sexton of the Pari&s;h-Church entered the Room in a Sort of Surprize, and told us, That as he was digging a Grave in the Chancel, a lit|tle Blow of his Pickax open'd a decayed Cof|fin, in which there were &s;everal written Papers. Our Curio&s;ity was immediately rai&s;ed, &s;o that we went to the Place where the Sexton had been at work, and found a great Concour&s;e of People about the Grave. Among the re&s;t, there was an old Woman, who told us, the Per&s;on buried there was a Lady, who&s;e Name I do not think fit to mention, though there is nothing in the Story but what tends very much to her Honour. This Lady lived &s;everal Years an Exemplary Pattern of Conjugal Love, and dying &s;oon after her Hu&s;|band, who every Way an&s;wer'd her Character in Virtue and Affection, made it her Death-Bed Re|que&s;t, That all the Letters which &s;he had re|ceived from him, both before and after her Mar|riage, &s;hould be buried in the Coffin with her. The&s;e I found upon Examination were the Papers before us. Several of them had &s;uffered &s;o much by Time, that I could only pick out a few Words; as, My Soul! Lillies! Ro&s;es! Deare&s;t Angel! and the like. One of them (which was legible through|out) ran thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you would know the Greatne&s;s of my Love, con|&s;ider that of your own Beauty. That Blooming
<PB N="334" REF="339">
Countenance, that Snowy Bo&s;om, that Graceful Per|&s;on, return every Moment to my Imagination: The Brightne&s;s of your Eyes hath hindered me from clo&s;ing mine &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw you. You may &s;till add to your Beauties by a Smile. A Frown will make me the mo&s;t wretched of Men, as I am the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate of Lovers.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>It filled the whole Company with a deep Me|lancholy, to compare the De&s;cription of the Let|ter with the Per&s;on that occa&s;ioned it, who was now reduced to a few crumbling Bones, and a little mouldring Heap of Earth. With much ado I deciphered another Letter, which begun with, <HI>My dear, dear Wife.</HI> This gave me a Curi|o&s;ity to &s;ee how the Style of one written in Mar|riage differed from one written in Court&s;hip. To my Surprize, I found the Fondne&s;s rather aug|mented than le&s;&s;ened, though the Panegyrick turned upon a different Accompli&s;hment. The Words were as follow:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>BEfore this &s;hort Ab&s;ence from you, I did not know that I loved you &s;o much as I really do; though at the &s;ame Time, I thought I loved you as much as po&s;&s;ible. I am under great Apprehen&s;ions, left you &s;hould have any Unea&s;ine&s;s whil&s;t I am de|frauded of my Share in it, and can't think of ta&s;t|ing any Plea&s;ures that you don't partake with me. Pray, my Dear, be careful of your Health, if for no other Rea&s;on, becau&s;e you know I could not cutlive you. It is natural in Ab&s;ence to make Profe&s;&s;ions of an inviolable Con&s;tancy; but towards &s;o much Merit, it is &s;carce a Virtue, e&s;pecially when it is but a bare Return to that of which you have given me &s;uch continued Proofs ever &s;ince our fir&s;t Acquaintance.</P>

<P>It happened that the Daughter of the&s;e Two excellent Per&s;ons was by when I was reading
<PB N="335" REF="340">
this Letter. At the Sight of the Coffin, in which was the Body of her Mother, near that of her Father, &s;he melted into a Flood of Tears. As I had heard a great Character of her Virtue, and ob&s;erved in her this In&s;tance of Filial Piety, I could not re&s;i&s;t my natural Inclination of giving Advice to young People, and therefore addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to her: Young Lady (&s;aid I), you &s;ee how &s;hort is the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Beauty in which Nature has been &s;o liberal to you. You find, the melancholy Sight before you is a Con|tradiction to the Fir&s;t Letter that you heard on that Subject; whereas you may ob&s;erve, the Second Letter, which celebrates your Mother's Con&s;tancy, is it &s;elf, being found in this Place, an Argument of it. But, Madam, I ought to caution you, not to think the Bodies that lie be|fore you, your Father and your Mother. Know their Con&s;tancy is rewarded by a nobler Union than by this mingling of their A&s;hes, in a State where there is no Danger or Po&s;&s;ibility of a Se|cond Separation.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as my Midnight Studies are fini&s;hed, I take but a very &s;hort Repo&s;e, and am again up at an Exerci&s;e of another Kind; that is to &s;ay, my Fencing. Thus my Life pa&s;&s;es away in a re&s;tle&s;s Pur&s;uit of Fame, and a Preparation to defend my &s;elf again&s;t &s;uch as attack it. This Anxiety in the Point of Reputation is the pecu|liar Di&s;tre&s;s of fine Spirits, and makes them lia|ble to a Thou&s;and Inquietudes, from which Men
<PB N="336" REF="341">
of gro&s;&s;er Under&s;tandings are exempt; &s;o that Nothing is more common, than to &s;ee one Part of Mankind live at perfect Ea&s;e under &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances as would make another Part of them entirely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve for a Preface to the Hi&s;tory of poor <HI>Will. Ro&s;in,</HI> the Fidler of <HI>Wapping,</HI> who is a Man as much made for Happine&s;s, and a quiet Life, as any one breathing; but has been lately intangled in &s;o many intricate and unrea&s;onable Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as would have made him (had he been a Man of too nice Honour) the mo&s;t wretch|ed of all Mortals. I came to the Knowledge of his Affairs by meer Accident. Several of the narrow End of our Lane having made an Ap|pointment to vi&s;it &s;ome Friends beyond St. <HI>Ka|therine</HI>'s, where there was to be a merry Meet|ing, they would needs take with them the Old Gentleman, as they are plea&s;ed to call me. I who value my Company by their good Will, which naturally has the &s;ame Effect as good Breeding, was not too &s;tately, or too wi&s;e, to accept of the Invitation. Our De&s;ign was to be Spectators of a Sea Ball; to which I readily con&s;ented, pro|vided I might be <HI>incognito,</HI> being naturally plea|&s;ed with the Survey of humane Life in all its Degrees and Circum&s;tances. In order to this Merriment, <HI>Will. Ro&s;in</HI> (who is the <HI>Corelli</HI> of the <HI>Wapping</HI>-Side, as <HI>Tom Scrape</HI> is the <HI>Bononcini</HI> of <HI>Redriffe</HI>) was immediately &s;ent for; but to our utter Di&s;appointment, poor <HI>Will.</HI> was under an Arre&s;t, and de&s;ired the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all his kind Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or he mu&s;t go to Gaol. The whole Company received his Me&s;&s;age with great Humanity, and very generou&s;ly threw in their Half-pence apiece in a great Di&s;h, which purcha&s;ed his Redemption out of the Hands of the Bailiffs. During the Negotiation for his En|largement, I had an Opportunity of acquainting my &s;elf with his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="342">
Mr. <HI>William Ro&s;in,</HI> of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Kathe|rine,</HI> is &s;omewhat &s;tricken in Years, and married to a young Woman, who has very much the A&s;|cendant over him: This degenerate Age be|ing &s;o perverted in all Things, that even in the State of Matrimony, the Young pretend to go|vern their Elders. The Mu&s;ician is extremely fond of her; but is often obliged to lay by his Fiddle to hear louder Notes of hers, when &s;he is plea&s;ed to be angry with him: For you are to know, <HI>Will.</HI> is not of Con&s;equence enough to enjoy her Conver&s;ation but when &s;he chides him, or makes u&s;e of him to carry on her Amours. For &s;he is a Woman of Stratagem; and even in that Part of the World where one would expect but very little Gallantry, by the Force of natural Genius, &s;he can be &s;ullen, &s;ick, out of Humour, Splenatick, want new Clothes, and more Money, as well as if &s;he had been bred in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> or <HI>Cornhill.</HI> She was lately under a &s;ecret Di&s;content upon Account of a Lover &s;he was like to lo&s;e by his Marriage: For her Gal|lant, Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Boniface,</HI> had been twice asked in Church, in order to be joined in Matrimony with Mrs. <HI>Winifred Dimple,</HI> Spin&s;ter, of the &s;ame Pari&s;h. Hereupon Mrs. <HI>Ro&s;in</HI> was far gone in that Di&s;temper which well-governed Husbands know by the De&s;cription of, <HI>I am I know not how;</HI> and <HI>Will.</HI> &s;oon under&s;tood, that it was his Part to enquire into the Occa&s;ion of her Melan|choly, or &s;uffer as the Cau&s;e of it him&s;elf. After much Importunity, all he could get out of her, was, That &s;he was the mo&s;t unhappy and the mo&s;t wicked of all Women, and had no Friend in the World to tell her Grief to. Upon this, <HI>Will.</HI> doubled his Importunities; but &s;he &s;aid. That &s;he &s;hould break her poor Heart, if he did not take a &s;olemn Oath upon a Book, that he would not be angry; and that he would expo&s;e the Per&s;on who had wronged her to all the
<PB N="338" REF="343">
World, for the Ea&s;e of her Mind, which was no way el&s;e to be quieted. The Fidler was &s;o mel|ted, that he immediately ki&s;&s;ed her, and after|wards the Book. When his Oath was taken, &s;he began to lament her &s;elf, and revealed to him, that (mi&s;erable Woman as &s;he was) &s;he had been fal&s;e to his Bed. <HI>Will.</HI> was glad to hear it was no wor&s;e; but before he could reply, Nay (&s;aid &s;he) I will make you all the Atonement I can, and take Shame upon me by proclaiming it to all the World, which is the only Thing that can re|move my pre&s;ent Terrors of Mind. This was in|deed too true; for her De&s;ign was to prevent Mr. <HI>Boniface</HI>'s Marriage, which was all &s;he appre|hended. <HI>Will.</HI> was throughly angry, and began to cur&s;e and &s;wear, the ordinary Expre&s;&s;ions of Pa&s;&s;ion in Per&s;ons of his Condition. Upon which his Wife&mdash;Ah <HI>William!</HI> How well you mind the Oath you have taken, and the Di&s;tre&s;s of your poor Wife, who can keep nothing from you; I hope you won't be &s;uch a perjur'd Wretch as to for&s;wear your &s;elf. The Fiddler an&s;wer'd, That his Oath obliged him only not to be angry at what was pa&s;&s;ed; but I find you intend to make me laughed at all over <HI>Wapping.</HI> No, no, (replied Mrs. <HI>Ro&s;in</HI>) I &s;ee well enough what you would be at, you poor-&s;pirited Cuckold&mdash;You are afraid to expo&s;e <HI>Boniface,</HI> who has abu&s;ed your poor Wife, and would fain per&s;wade me &s;till to &s;uffer the Stings of Con&s;cience; but I a&s;&s;ure you Sirrah, I won't go to the Devil for you. Poor <HI>Will.</HI> was not made for Contention, and be&s;eeching her to be pacified, de&s;ired &s;he would con&s;ult the Good of her Soul her own Way, for he would not &s;ay her nay in any Thing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Ro&s;in</HI> was &s;o very loud and publick in her Invectives again&s;t <HI>Boniface,</HI> that the Parents of his Mi&s;tre&s;s forbad the Banes, and his Match was prevented, which was the whole De&s;ign of this deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">atagem. The Father of <HI>Boniface</HI> brought
<PB N="339" REF="344">
his Action of Defamation, arre&s;ted the Fiddler, and recovered Dammages. This was the Di&s;tre&s;s from which he was relieved by the Company; and the good Husband's Air, Hi&s;tory, and Jollity, upon his Enlargement, gave Occa&s;ion to very much Mirth; e&s;pecially when <HI>Will.</HI> finding he had Friends to &s;tand by him, proclaimed him&s;elf a Cuckold by Way of In&s;ult over the Family of the <HI>Bonifaces.</HI> Here is a Man of Tranquility without reading <HI>Seneca!</HI> What Work had &s;uch an Incident made among Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction?

Who would believe that <HI>Herod, Othello,</HI> and <HI>Will. Ro&s;in,</HI> were of the &s;ame Species?</P>
<P>There are quite different Sentiments which reign in the Parlour and the Kitchin; and it is by the Point of Honour, when ju&s;tly regulated, and inviolably ob&s;erved, that &s;ome Men are &s;uperior to others, as much as Mankind in general are to Brutes. This puts me in Mind of a Pa&s;&s;age in the admirable Poem called the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary,</HI> where the Nature of true Honour is artfully de&s;cribed in an Ironical Di&s;prai&s;e of it.</P>
<Q><L>But e're we once engage in Honour's Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t know what Honour is, and whence it was.</L>
<L>Scorn'd by the Ba&s;e, 'tis courted by the Brave,</L>
<L>The Hero's Tyrant, and the Coward's Slave.</L>
<L>Born in the noi&s;y Camp, it lives on Air;</L>
<L>And both exi&s;ts by Hope, and by De&s;pair.</L>
<L>Angry when e're a Moment's Ea&s;e we gain,</L>
<L>And reconcil'd at our Returns of Pain.</L>
<L>It lives, when in Death's Arms the Here lies,</L>
<L>But when his Safety he con&s;ults, it dies.</L>

<P>I Was this Evening &s;itting at the Side-Table, and reading one of my own Papers with great Satisfaction, not knowing that I was ob&s;erved by any in the Room. I had not long enjoyed this &s;ecret Plea&s;ure of an Author, when a Gentleman, &s;ome of who&s;e Works I have been highly enter|tained
<PB N="341" REF="346">
with, acco&s;ted me after the following Manner: Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you know I have for &s;ome Years devoted my &s;elf wholly to the Mu|&s;es, and perhaps you will be &s;urprized when I tell you I am re&s;olved to take up and apply my &s;elf to Bu&s;ine&s;s: I &s;hall therefore beg you will &s;tand my Friend, and recommend a Cu&s;tomer to me for &s;everal Goods that I have now upon my Hands, I de&s;ir'd him to let me have a Particu|lar, and I would do my utmo&s;t to &s;erve him. I have fir&s;t of all (&s;ays he) the Progre&s;s of an Amour dige&s;ted into Sonnets, beginning with a Poem to the unknown Fair, and ending with an Epithalamium. I have celebrated in it, her Cruelty, her Pity, her Face, her Shape, her Wit, her good Humour, her Dancing, her Sing|ing&mdash;<HI>I could not forbear interrupting him; This is a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Lady, &s;aid I; but has &s;he really, with all the&s;e Perfections, a fine Voice?</HI> Pugh, &s;ays he, you do not believe there is &s;uch a Per&s;on in Nature. This was only my Employ|ment in Solitude la&s;t Summer, when I had nei|ther Friends or Books to divert me. I was go|ing, &s;ays I, to ask her Name, but I find it is only an imaginary Mi&s;tre&s;s. That's true, replied my Friend, but her Name is <HI>Flavia.</HI> I have, continued he, in the Second Place, a Collection of Lampoons, calculated either for the <HI>Bath, Tunbridge,</HI> or any Place where they drink Wa|ters, with blank Spaces for the Names of &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons as may be in&s;erted in them on Occa&s;ion. Thus much I have told only of what I have by me proceeding from Love and Malice. I have al&s;o at this Time the Sketch of an He|roick Poem upon the next Peace: Several indeed of the Ver&s;es are either too long or too &s;hort, it being a rough Draught of my Thoughts upon that Subject. I thereupon told him, That as it was, it might probably pa&s;s for a very good Pin|darick, and I believed I knew one who would be
<PB N="342" REF="347">
willing to deal with him for it upon that Foot. I mu&s;t tell you al&s;o, I have made a Dedication to it, which is about four Sides clo&s;e written, that may &s;erve any one that is tall, and under&s;tands <HI>Latin.</HI> I have further, about Fifty Similies, that were ne|ver yet applied, be&s;ides Three and twenty De|&s;criptions of the Sun-ri&s;ing, that might be of great U&s;e to an Epick Poet. The&s;e are my more bulky Commodities: Be&s;ides which, I have &s;everal &s;mall Wares that I would part with at ea&s;y Rates; as, Ob&s;ervations upon Life, and Moral Sentences, re|duced into &s;everal Couplets, very proper to clo&s;e up Acts of Plays, and may be ea&s;ily introduced by two or three Lines of Pro&s;e, either in Tragedy or Comedy. If I could find a Purcha&s;er curious in <HI>Latin</HI> Poetry, I could accommodate him with Two Dozen of Epigrams, which, by Rea&s;on of a few fal&s;e Quantities, &s;hould come for little or no|thing.</P>
<P>I heard the Gentleman with much Attention, and asked him, Whether he would break Bulk, and &s;ell his Goods by Retail, or de&s;igned they &s;hould all go in a Lump? He told me, That he &s;hould be very loth to part them, unle&s;s it was to oblige a Man of Quality, or any Per&s;on for whom I had a particular Friend&s;hip. My Rea&s;on for asking (&s;aid I) is, only becau&s;e I know a young Gentleman who intends to appear next Spring in a new gingling Chariot, with the Figures of the Nine Mu&s;es on each Side of it; and I believe, would be glad to come into the World in Ver&s;e. We could not go on in our Treaty, by rea&s;on of Two or Three Criticks that joined us. They had been talking, it &s;eems, of the Two Letters which were found in the Coffin, and mentioned in one of my late Lucubrations, and came with a Reque&s;t to me, that I would communicate any others of them that were legible. One of the Gentlemen was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That it was a very proper In|&s;tance of a Widow's Con&s;tancy; and &s;aid, he
<PB N="343" REF="348">
wi&s;hed I had &s;ubjoined, as a Foil to it, the follow|ing Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Hamlet.</HI> The young Prince was not yet acquainted with all the Guilt of his Mo|ther, but turns his Thoughts on her &s;udden For|getfulne&s;s of his Father, and the Indecency of her ha&s;ty Marriage.</P>

<L>Mu&s;t I remember? Why &s;he would hang on him!</L>

<L>E'er yet the Salt of mo&s;t unrighteous Tears,</L>
<L>Had left the Flu&s;hing of her gauled Eyes,</L>
<L>She marry'd&mdash;O mo&s;t wicked Speed! To po&s;t</L>

<P>The &s;everal Emotions of Mind and Breaks of Pa&s;&s;ion, in this Speech, are admirable. He has touched every Circum&s;tance that aggravated the Fact, and &s;eemed capable of hurrying the Thoughts of a Son into Diftraction. His Father's Tender|ne&s;s for his Mother, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;o delicate a Par|ticular;
<PB N="344" REF="349">
his Mother's Fondne&s;s for his Father no le&s;s exqui&s;itely de&s;cribed; the great and amiable Figure of his dead Parent drawn by a true Filial Piety; his Di&s;dain of &s;o unworthy a Succe&s;&s;or to his Bed: But above all, the Shortne&s;s of the Time between his Father's Death and his Mother's Second Marriage, brought together with &s;o much Di&s;order, make up as noble a Part as any in that celebrated Tragedy.

<P>ABout Four this Afternoon, which is the Hour I u&s;ually put my &s;elf in a Readine&s;s to re|ceive Company, there enter'd a Gentleman who I believed at fir&s;t came upon &s;ome ordinary Que|&s;tion; but as he approached nearer to me, I &s;aw in his Countenance a deep Sorrow, mixed with a certain ingenuous Complacency that gave me a &s;udden Good-will towards him. He &s;tar'd, and betrayed an Ab&s;ence of Thought as he was going to communicate his Bu&s;ine&s;s to me. But at la&s;t, recovering him&s;elf, he &s;aid, with an Air of great Re&s;pect, Sir, It would be an Injury to your Knowledge in the Occult Sciences, to tell you what is my Di&s;tre&s;s; I dare &s;ay, you read it in my Countenance: I therefore beg your Advice
<PB N="346" REF="351">
to the mo&s;t unhappy of all Men. Much Experi|ence has made me particularly &s;agacious in the Di&s;|covery of Di&s;tempers, and I &s;oon &s;aw that his was Love. I then turned to my Common-place Book, and found his Ca&s;e under the Word <HI>Coquette;</HI> and reading over the Catalogue which I have collected out of this great City of all under that Character, I &s;aw at the Name of <HI>Cynthia</HI> his fit came upon him. I repeated the Name thrice after a mu&s;ing Manner, and immediately perceived his Pul&s;e quicken two Thirds; when his Eyes, in&s;tead of the Wildne&s;s with which they appeared at his En|trance, looked with all the Gentlene&s;s imaginable upon me, not without Tears. Oh, Sir! (&s;aid he) you know not the unworthy U&s;age I have met with from the Woman my Soul doats on. I could gaze at her to the End of my Being; yet when I have done &s;o, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t I have found her Eyes fix'd on another. She is now Two and twen|ty in the full Tyranny of her Charms, which &s;he once acknowledg'd &s;he rejoiced in, only as they made her Choice of me, out of a Crowd of Ad|mirers, the more obliging. But in the Mid&s;t of this Happine&s;s, &s;o it is Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> that young <HI>Quick&s;ett,</HI> who is ju&s;t come to Town, without any other Recommendation than that of being tolera|bly hand&s;ome, and exce&s;&s;ively rich, has won her Heart in &s;o &s;hamele&s;s a Manner, that &s;he dies for him. In a Word, I would con&s;ult you, how to cure my &s;elf of this Pa&s;&s;ion for an ungrateful Wo|man, who triumphs in her Fal&s;hood, and can make no Man happy, becau&s;e her own Satisfaction con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly in being capable of giving Di&s;tre&s;s. I know <HI>Quick&s;ett</HI> is at pre&s;ent con&s;iderable with her for no other Rea&s;on but that he can be without her, and feel no Pain in the Lo&s;s. Let me therefore de|&s;ire you, Sir, to fortify my Rea&s;on again&s;t the Le|vity of an Incon&s;tant, who ought only to be trea|ted with Neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="352">
All this Time I was looking over my Re|ceipts, and asked him, if he had any good W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ter Boots&mdash;Boots, Sir! &s;aid my Patient&mdash;I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> on; You may ea&s;ily reach <HI>Harwich</HI> in a Day, &s;o as to be there when the Packet goes off. Sir, (&s;aid the Lover) I find you de&s;ign me for Travel|ling; but alas! I have no Language, it will be the &s;ame Thing to me as Solitude, to be in a &s;trange Country. I have (continued he, &s;ighing) been many Years in Love with this Creature, and have almo&s;t lo&s;t even my <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> at lea&s;t to &s;peak &s;uch as any Body el&s;e does. I asked a Te|nant of ours, who came up to Town the other Day with Rent, Whether the Flowry Meads near my Father's Hou&s;e in the Country had any Shep|herd in it? I have called a Cave a Grotto the&s;e Three Years, and mu&s;t keep ordinary Company, and frequent bu&s;ie People for &s;ome Time, before I can recover my common Words. I &s;miled at his Raillery upon him&s;elf, though I well &s;aw it came from an heavy Heart. You are (&s;aid I) ac|quainted to be &s;ure with &s;ome of the General Of|ficers; Suppo&s;e you made a Campaign? If I did, (&s;aid he) I &s;hould venture more than any M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n there, for I &s;hould be in Danger of &s;tarving; my Father is &s;uch an untoward old Gentleman, that he would tell me he &s;ound it hard enough to pay his Taxes towards the War, without making it more expen&s;ive by an Allowance to me. With all this, he is as fond as he is ragged, and I am his only Son.</P>
<P>I looked upon the young Gentleman with much Tenderne&s;s, and not like a Phy&s;ician, but a Friend; for I talked to him &s;o largely, that if I had parcelled my Di&s;cour&s;e into di&s;tinct Pre|&s;criptions, I am confident I give him Two Hun|dred Pounds worth of Advice. He heard me with great Attention, bowing, &s;milling, and &s;how|ing all other In&s;tances of that natural good Breed|ing which ingenuous Tempers pay to tho&s;e
<PB N="348" REF="353">
who are elder and wi&s;er than them&s;elves. I en|tertained him to the following Purpo&s;e. I am &s;orry, Sir, that your Pa&s;&s;ion is of &s;o long a Date, for Evils are much more curable in their Begin|nings; but at the &s;ame Time mu&s;t allow, that you are not to be blamed, &s;ince your Youth and Merit has been abu&s;ed by one of the mo&s;t char|ming, but the mo&s;t unworthy Sort of Women, the Coquets. A Coquet is a cha&s;t Jilt, and dif|fers only from a Common One, as a Soldier, who is perfect in Exerci&s;e, does from one that is actu|ally in Service. This Grief, like all other, is to be cured only by Time; and although you are convinced this Moment, as much as you will be Ten Years hence, that &s;he ought to be &s;corned and neglected, you &s;ee you mu&s;t not expect your Remedy from the Force of Rea&s;on. The Cure then is only in Time, and the ha&s;tening of the Cure only in the Manner of employing that Time. You have an&s;wered me as to Travel and a Campaign, &s;o that we have only <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> to avoid her in. Be then your &s;elf, and li&s;ten to the following Rules, which only can be of U&s;e to you in this unaccountable Di&s;temper, wherein the Patient is often aver&s;e even to his Recovery. It has been of Benefit to &s;ome to apply them&s;elves to Bu&s;ine&s;s; but as that may not lie in your Way, go down to your E&s;tate, mind your Fox hounds, and venture the Life you are weary of over every Hedge and Ditch in the Country. The&s;e are whole&s;ome Remedies; but if you can have Re&s;olution enough, rather &s;tay in Town, and recover your &s;elf even in the Town where &s;he inhabits. Take particular Care to avoid all Places where you may po&s;&s;ibly meet her, and &s;hun the Sight of every Thing which may bring her to your Remembrance; there is an Infection in all that relates to her: You'll find, her Hou&s;e, her Chariot, her Dome&s;ticks, and her very Lap-Dog, are &s;o many In&s;truments
<PB N="349" REF="354">
of Torment. Tell me &s;eriou&s;ly, Do you think you could bear the Sight of her Fan? He &s;hook his Head at the Que&s;tion, and &s;aid, Ah! Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> you mu&s;t have been a Patient, or you could not have been &s;o good a Phy&s;ician. To tell you truly, &s;aid I, about the Thirtieth Year of my Age, I received a Wound that has &s;till left a Scar in my Mind, never to be quite worn out by Time or Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The Means which I found the mo&s;t effectual for my Cure, were Reflections upon the ill U&s;age I had received from the Woman I loved, and the Plea&s;ure I &s;aw her take in my Sufferings.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered the Di&s;tre&s;s &s;he brought upon me, the greate&s;t that could befal an humane Crea|ture, at the &s;ame Time that &s;he did not inflict this upon one who was her Enemy, one that had done her an Injury, one that had wi&s;hed her ill; but on the Man who loved her more than any el&s;e loved her, and more than it was po&s;&s;ible for him to love any other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>In the next Place, I took Pains to con&s;ider her in all her Imperfections; and that I might be &s;ure to hear of them con&s;tantly, kept Company with tho&s;e her Female Friends who were her deare&s;t and mo&s;t intimate Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Among her highe&s;t Imperfections, I &s;till dwelt upon her Ba&s;ene&s;s of Mind and Ingratitude, that made her triumph in the Pain and Angui&s;h of the Man who loved her, and of one who in tho&s;e Days (without Vanity be it &s;poken) was thought to de&s;erve her Love.</P>
<P>To &s;horten my Story, &s;he was married to ano|ther, which would have di&s;tracted me had he proved a good Husband; but to my great Plea|&s;ure, he u&s;ed her at fir&s;t with Coldne&s;s, and afterwards with Contempt. I hear he &s;till treats her very ill; and am informed, that &s;he often &s;ays to her Woman, This is a ju&s;t Revenge for my Fal&s;hood to my Fir&s;t Love: What a Wretch
<PB N="350" REF="355">
am I, that might have been married to the fa|mous Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff.</HI></P>
<P>My Patient looked upon me with a kind of me|lancholy Plea&s;ure, and told me, He did not think it was po&s;&s;ible for a Man to live to the Age I now am of, who in his Thirtieth Year had been tor|tured with that Pa&s;&s;ion in its Violence: For my Part, (&s;aid he) I can neither eat, drink, nor &s;leep in it; nor keep Company with any Body, but Two or Three Friends who are in the &s;ame Con|dition.</P>
<P>There (an&s;wer'd I) you are to blame; for as you ought to avoid nothing more than keeping Company with your &s;elf, &s;o you ought to be par|ticularly cautious of keeping Company with Men like your &s;elf. As long as you do this, you do but indulge your Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not di&s;mi&s;s you without further In&s;tru|ctions. If po&s;&s;ible, transfer your Pa&s;&s;ion from the Woman you are now in Love with, to another; or if you cannot do that, change the Pa&s;&s;ion it &s;elf into &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ion; that is, to &s;peak more plainly, find out &s;ome other agreeable Wo|man: Or if you can't do this, grow covetous, ambitious, litigious; turn your Love of Woman into that of Profit, Preferment, Reputation; and for a Time, give up your &s;elf intirely to the Pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P>This is a Method we &s;ometimes take in Phy&s;ick, when we turn a de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;e into one we can more ea&s;ily cure.</P>
<P>He made little An&s;wer to all this, but crying out, Ah, Sir! For his Pa&s;&s;ion reduced his Di&s;|cour&s;e to Interjections.</P>
<P>There is one Thing added, which is pre&s;ent Death to a Man in your Condition, and therefore to be avoided with the greate&s;t Care and Cau|tion: That is, in a Word; to think of your Mi|&s;tre&s;s and Rival together, whether walking, di&s;|cour&s;ing, dallying&mdash;The Devil! He cried out,
<PB N="351" REF="356">
Who can bear it? To compo&s;e him, for I pitied him very much, the Time will come, &s;aid I, when you &s;hall not only bear it, but laugh at it. As a Preparation to it, ride every Morning an Hour at lea&s;t with the Wind full in your Face. Upon your Return, recollect the &s;everal Precepts which I have now given you, and drink upon them a Bot|tle of <HI>Spaw-Water.</HI> Repeat this every Day for a Month &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and let me &s;ee you at the End of it. He was taking his Leave, with many Thanks, and &s;ome Appearance of Con&s;olation in his Countenance, when I called him back to ac|quaint him, That I had private Information of a De&s;ign of the Coquets to buy up all the true <HI>Spaw-Water</HI> in Town: Upon which he took his Leave in ha&s;te, with a Re&s;olution to get all Things ready for entring upon his Regimen the next Morning.</P>

<P>IT is not to be imagined, how great an Effect well di&s;po&s;ed Lights, with proper Forms and Orders in A&s;&s;emblies, have upon &s;ome Tempers. I am &s;ure I feel it in &s;o extraordinary a Manner, that I cannot in a Day or Two get out of my Imagination any very beautiful or di&s;agreeable Impre&s;&s;ion which I receive on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. For this Rea&s;on I frequently look in at the Play|hou&s;e,
<PB N="352" REF="357">
in order to enlarge my Thoughts, and warm my Mind with &s;ome new Idea's, that may be &s;erviceable to me in my Lucubrations. In this Di&s;po&s;ition I entered the Theatre the other Day, and placed my &s;elf in a Corner of it, very convenient for &s;eeing, without being my &s;elf ob|&s;erved. I found the Audience hu&s;hed in a very deep Attention, and did not que&s;tion but &s;ome noble Tragedy was ju&s;t then in its Cri&s;is, or that an Incident was to be unravelled which would determine the Fate of an Hero. While I was in this Su&s;pence, expecting every Moment to &s;ee my old Friend Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> appear in all the Maje&s;ty of Di&s;tre&s;s, to my un&s;peakable Amaze|ment, there came up a Mon&s;ter with a Face be|tween his Feet; and as I was looking on, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf on one Leg in &s;uch a perpendicu|lar Po&s;ture, that the other grew in a Direct Line above his Head. It afterwards twi&s;ted it &s;elf into the Motions and Wreathings of &s;everal diffe|rent Animals, and after great Variety of Shapes and Transformations, went off the Stage in the Figure of an humane Creature. The Admira|tion, the Applau&s;e, the Satisfaction, of the Au|dience, during this &s;trange Entertainment, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I was very much out of Coun|tenance for my dear Countrymen, and looked about with &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion for Fear any Fo|reigner &s;hould be pre&s;ent. Is it po&s;&s;ible (thought I) that humane Nature can rejoice in its Di&s;grace, and take Plea&s;ure in &s;eeing its own Figure turn|ed to Ridicule, and di&s;torted into Forms that rai&s;e Horror and Aver&s;ion? There is &s;omething di&s;ingenuous and immoral in the being able to bear &s;uch a Sight. Men of elegant and noble Minds, are &s;hocked at &s;eeing the Characters of Per&s;ons who de&s;erve E&s;teem for their Virtue, Knowledge, or Services to their Country, placed in wrong Lights, and by Mi&s;repre&s;entation made the Subject of Buffoonry. Such a nice Abhor|rence
<PB N="353" REF="358">
is not indeed to be found among the Vul|gar; but methinks it is wonderful, that the&s;e who have nothing but the outward Figure to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them as Men, &s;hould delight in &s;eeing it a|bu&s;ed, vilified, and di&s;graced.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is nothing that more plea&s;es me, in all that I read in Books, or &s;ee among Mankind, than &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as repre&s;ent humane Nature in its proper Dignity. As Man is a Creature made up of different Extremes, he has &s;omething in him very great and very mean: A skilful Arti&s;t may draw an excellent Picture of him in either of the&s;e Views. The fine&s;t Au|thors of Antiquity have taken him on the more advantagious Side. They cultivate the natural Grandeur of the Soul, rai&s;e in her a generous Ambition, feed her with Hopes of Immortality and Perfection, and do all they can to widen the Partition between the Virtuous and the Vi|cious, by making the Difference betwixt them as great as between Gods and Brutes. In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to read a Page in <HI>Plato, Tully,</HI> and a Thou&s;and other ancient Morali&s;ts, with|out being a greater and a better Man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our mo|di&s;h <HI>French</HI> Authors, or tho&s;e of our own Coun|try who are the Imitators and Admirers of that trifling Nation, without being for &s;ome Time out of Humour with my &s;elf, and at every Thing about me. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to depre|ciate humane Nature, and con&s;ider it under its wor&s;t Appearances. They give mean Interpreta|tions and ba&s;e Motives to the worthie&s;t Actions: They re&s;olve Virtue and Vice into Con&s;titution. In &s;hort, they endeavour to make no Di&s;tinction between Man and Man, or between the Species of Men and that of Brutes. As an In&s;tance of this kind of Authors, among many others, let any one examine the celebrated <HI>Rochefaucault,</HI> who is the great Philo&s;opher for admini&s;tring of
<PB N="354" REF="359">
Con&s;olation to the Idle, the Envious, and worth|le&s;s Part of Mankind.</P>
<P>I remember a young Gentleman of moderate Under&s;tanding, but great Vivacity, who by dip|ping into many Authors of this Nature, had got a little Smattering of Knowledge, ju&s;t enough to make an Athei&s;t or a Free-thinker, but not a Philo&s;opher or a Man of Sen&s;e. With the&s;e Ac|compli&s;hments, he went to vi&s;it his Father in the Country, who was a plain rough, hone&s;t Man, and wi&s;e, though not learned. The Son, who took all Opportunities to &s;how his Learning, began to e&s;tabli&s;h a new Religion in the Family, and to enlarge the Narrowne&s;s of their Coun|try Notions; in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he had &s;educed the Butler by his Table Talk, and &s;taggered his elde&s;t Si&s;ter. The old Gentle|man began to be alarmed at the Schi&s;ms that aro&s;e among his Children, but did not yet be|lieve his Son's Doctrine to be &s;o pernicious as it really was, 'till one Day talking of his Setting. Dog, the Son &s;aid, He did not que&s;tion but <HI>Trey</HI> was as immortal as any one of the Family; and in the Heat of the Argument told his Father, That for his own Part, he expected to die like a Dog. Upon which, the old Man &s;tarting up in a very great Pa&s;&s;ion, cried out, Then, Sirrah, you &s;hall live like one; and taking his Cane in his Hand, cudgelled him out of his Sy&s;tem. This had &s;o good an Effect upon him, that he took up from that Day, fell to reading good Books, and is now a Bencher in the <HI>Middle-Temple.</HI></P>
<P>I do not mention this Cudgelling Part of the Story with a De&s;ign to engage the &s;ecular Arm in Matters of this Nature; but certainly, if it ever exerts it &s;elf in Affairs of Opinion and Spe|culation, it ought to do it on &s;uch &s;hallow and de&s;picable Pretenders to Knowledge. who endea|vour to give a Man dark and uncomfortable Pro|&s;pects
<PB N="355" REF="360">
of his Being, and de&s;troy tho&s;e Principles which are the Support, Happine&s;s, and Glory, of all publick Societies, as well as private Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I think it is one of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Golden Sayings, <HI>That a Man &s;hould take Care above all Things to have a due Re&s;pect for him&s;elf:</HI> And it is certain, that this licentious Sort of Authors, who are for depreciating Mankind, endeavoured to di&s;appoint and undo what the mo&s;t refined Spirits have been labouring to advance &s;ince the Beginning of the World. The very De&s;ign of Dre&s;s, good Breed|ings, outward Ornaments, and Ceremony, were to lift up humane Nature, and &s;et it off to an Ad|vantage. Architecture, Painting, and Statuary, were invented with the &s;ame De&s;ign; as indeed every Art and Science contributes to the Embel|li&s;hment of Life, and to the wearing off or throw|ing into Shades the mean and low Parts of our Nature. Poetry carries on this great End more than all the re&s;t, as may be &s;een in the following Pa&s;&s;age, taken out of Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI>'s <HI>Advance|ment of Learning,</HI> which gives a truer and better Account of this Art than all the Volumes that were ever written upon it.</P>
<Q>Poetry, e&s;pecially Heroical, &s;eems to be rai&s;ed al|together from a noble Foundation, which makes much for the Dignity of Man's Nature. For &s;ee|ing this &s;en&s;ible World is in Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man, Poe&s;y &s;eems to endow humane Na|ture with that which Hi&s;tory denies; and to give Satisfaction to the Mind, with at lea&s;t the Sha|dow of Things, where the Sub&s;tance cannot be had. For if the Matter be throughly con&s;idered, a &s;trong Argument may be drawn from Poe&s;y, that a more &s;tately Greatne&s;s of Things, a more perfect Order, and a more beautiful Variety, delights the Soul of Man, than any Way can be found in Na|ture &s;ince the Fall. Wherefore &s;eeing the Acts and Events, which are the Subjects of true Hi&s;tory,
<PB N="356" REF="361">
are not of that Amplitude as to content the Mind of Man; Poe&s;y is ready at Hand to feign Acts more Heroical. Becau&s;e true Hi&s;tory reports the Succe&s;&s;es of Bu&s;ine&s;s not proportionable to the Merit of Virtues and Vices, Poe&s;y corrects it, and pre&s;ents Events and Fortunes according to De&s;ert, and according to the Law of Providence: Becau&s;e true Hi&s;tory, through the frequent Satiety and Similitude of Things, works a Di&s;ta&s;t and Mi&s;pri&s;ion in the Mind of Man, Poe&s;y cheareth and refre&s;heth the Soul, chanting Things rare and various, and full of Vici&s;&s;itudes. So as Poe&s;y &s;erveth and conferreth to Delectation, Magnanimity, and Morality; and therefore it may &s;eem de&s;ervedly to have &s;ome Participation of Divinene&s;s, becau&s;e it doth rai&s;e the Mind, and exalt the Spirit with high Raptures, by proportioning the Shews of Things to the De&s;ires of the Mind; and not &s;ubmitting the Mind to Things, as Rea&s;on and Hi&s;tory do. And by the&s;e Allurements and Congruities, whereby it cheri&s;heth the Soul of Man, joined al&s;o with Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, whereby it may more &s;weetly in&s;inuate it &s;elf; it hath won &s;uch Acce&s;s, that it hath been in E&s;tima|tion even in rude Times, and barbarous Nations, when other Learning &s;tood excluded.</Q>
<P>But there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural Greatne&s;s and Dignity of hu|mane Nature &s;o much as Religion, which does not only promi&s;e the entire Refinement of the Mind, but the glorifying of the Body, and the Immortality of both.</P>

<P>THere has not &s;ome Years been &s;uch a Tu|mult in our Neighbourhood as this Even|ing about Six. At the lower End of the Lane the Word was given, That there was a great Fu|neral coming by. The next Moment came for|ward in a very ha&s;ty, in&s;tead of a &s;olemn, Man|ner, a long Train of Lights, when at la&s;t a Foot|man, in very high Youth and Health, with all his Force, ran through the whole Art of beating the Door of the Hou&s;e next to me, and ended his Rattle with the true fini&s;hing Rap. This did not only bring one to the Door at which he knocked, but to that of every one in the Lane in an In|&s;tant. Among&s;t the re&s;t, my Country Maid took the Alarm, and immediately running to me, told me, there was a fine, fine Lady, who had Three Men with Burial Torches making Way before her, carried by Two Men upon Poles, with Looking|gla&s;&s;es on each Side of her, and one Gla&s;s al&s;o before, &s;he her &s;elf appearing the prettie&s;t that ever was. The Girl was going on in her Story, when the Lady was come to my Door in her Chair, having mi&s;taken the Hou&s;e. As &s;oon as &s;he entered, I &s;aw &s;he was Mr. <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Scholar, by her Speaking Air, and the becoming Stop &s;he made when &s;he began her Apology. You'll be &s;urprized Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) that I take this Li|berty. who am utterly a Stranger to you: Be|&s;ides that, it may be thought an Indecorum that
<PB N="358" REF="363">
I vi&s;it a Man. She made here a pretty He&s;itation, and held her Fan to her Face&mdash;Then, as if recovering her Re&s;olution, &s;he proceeded&mdash;But I think you have &s;aid, that Men of your Age are of no Sex; therefore I may be as free with you as one of my own. The Lady did me the Honour to con&s;ult me on &s;ome particular Mat|ters, which I am not at Liberty to report. But before &s;he took her Leave, &s;he produced a long Li&s;t of Names, which &s;he looked upon to know whither &s;he was to go next. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could hardly forbear di&s;covering to her imme|diately, that I &s;ecretly laughed at the fanta&s;tical Regularity &s;he ob&s;erved in throwing away her Time; but I &s;eemed to indulge her in it, out of a Curio&s;ity to hear her own Sen&s;e of her Way of Life. Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) you cannot imagine how much you are obliged to me in &s;taying thus long with you, having &s;o ma|ny Vi&s;its to make; and indeed, if I had not Hopes that a Third Part of tho&s;e I am going to will be Abroad, I &s;hould be unable to di&s;patch them this Evening. Madam, (&s;aid I) Are you in all this Ha&s;te and Perplexity, and only going to &s;uch as you have not a Mind to &s;ee? Yes Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) I have &s;everal now with whom I keep a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence, and return Vi&s;it for Vi&s;it punctually every Week, and yet we have not &s;een each other &s;ince la&s;t <HI>November</HI> was Twelve|month.</P>
<P>She went on with a very good Air, and fix|ing her Eyes on her Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t, told me, &s;he was obli|ged to ride about Three Miles and an half be|fore &s;he arrived at her own Hou&s;e. I asked af|ter what Manner this Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t was taken, whether the Per&s;ons writ their Names to her, and de&s;i|red that Favour, or how &s;he knew &s;he was not cheated in her Mu&s;ter-Roll? The Method we take (&s;ays &s;he) is, That the Porter or Servant who comes to the Door, writes down all the
<PB N="359" REF="364">
Names who come to &s;ee us, and all &s;uch are en|titled to a Return of their Vi&s;it. But, &s;aid I, Ma|dam, I pre&s;ume tho&s;e who are &s;earching for each other, and know one another by Me&s;&s;ages, may be under&s;tood as Candidates only for each other's Favour; and that after &s;o many Howdee's, you proceed to vi&s;it or not, as you like the Run of each other's Reputation or Fortune. You under&s;tand it aright, &s;aid &s;he, and we become Friends. As &s;oon as we are convinced that our Di&s;like to each other may be of any Con&s;equence, for to tell you truly, &s;aid &s;he, (for it is in vain to hide any Thing from a Man of your Penetration) general Vi&s;its are not made out of good Will, but for Fear of ill Will. Punctuality in this Ca&s;e is often a &s;u&s;pi|cious Circum&s;tance; and there is nothing &s;o com|mon as to have a Lady &s;ay, I hope &s;he has heard nothing of what I &s;aid of her, that &s;he grows &s;o great with me&mdash;But indeed, my Porter is &s;o dull and negligent, that I fear he has not put down half the People I owe Vi&s;its to. Madam, &s;aid I, methinks it &s;hould be very proper if your Gentleman-U&s;her or Groom of the Chamber were always to keep an Account by Way of Debtor and Creditor. I know a City Lady who u&s;es that Method, which I think very laudable; for tho' you may po&s;&s;ibly at the Court-End of the Town receive at the Door, and light up better than within <HI>Temple Bar,</HI> yet I mu&s;t do that Ju&s;tice to my Friends the Ladies within the Walls to own, that they are much more exact in their Corre&s;pon|dence. The Lady I was going to mention as an Example, has always the Second Prentice out of the Compting-hou&s;e for her own U&s;e on her Vi&s;it|ing-Day, and he &s;ets down very methodically all the Vi&s;its which are made her. I remember very well, that on the Fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, when &s;he made up her Account for the Year 1708, it &s;tood thus:

<P>This Gentlewoman is a Woman of great Oe|conomy, and was not afraid to go to the Bottom of her Affairs; and therefore ordered her Ap|prentice to give her Credit for my Lady <HI>Ea&s;y</HI>'s impertinent Vi&s;its upon wrong Days, and de|duct only Twelve <HI>per Cent.</HI> He had Orders al&s;o to &s;ub&s;tract One and an Half from the whole of &s;uch as &s;he had denied her &s;elf to before &s;he kept a Day; and after taking tho&s;e proper Arti|cles of Credit on her Side, &s;he was in Arrear but Five Hundred. She ordered her Husband to buy in a Couple of fre&s;h Coach-Hor&s;es; and with no other Lo&s;s, than the Death of Two Footmen, and a Church-yard Cough brought upon her Coachman, &s;he was clear in the World on the 10th of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, and keeps &s;o be|fore-hand, that &s;he pays every Body their own, and yet makes daily new Acquaintances. I know not whether this agreeable Vi&s;itant was fired with the Example of the Lady I told her of, but &s;he immediately vani&s;hed out of my Sight, it being, it &s;eems, as nece&s;&s;ary a Point of good Breeding, to go off as if you &s;tole &s;ome|thing out of the Hou&s;e, as it is to enter as if you came to fire it. I do not know one Thing that contributes &s;o much to the le&s;&s;ening the E&s;teem Men of Sen&s;e have to the Fair Sex as this Article of Vi&s;its. A young Lady cannot be married, but all the Impertinents in Town mu&s;t be beating the <HI>Tattoo</HI> from one Quarter of the Town to the other, to &s;how they know what pa&s;&s;es. If a Man of Honour &s;hould once in an
<PB N="361" REF="366">
Age marry a Woman of Merit for her intrin|&s;ick Value, the envious Things are all in Mo|tion in an In&s;tant to make it known to the Si&s;ter|hood as an Indi&s;eretion, and publi&s;h to the Town how many Pounds he might have had to have been troubled with one of them. After they are tired with that, the next Thing is, to make their Compliments to the married Couple and their Re|lations. They are equally bu&s;y at a Funeral, and the Death of a Per&s;on of Quality is always at|tended with the Murder of &s;everal Sets of Coach-Hor&s;es and Chairmen. In both Ca&s;es, the Vi&s;i|tants are wholly unaffected, either with Joy or Sorrow. For which Rea&s;on, their Congratulations and Condoleances are equally Words of Cour&s;e; and one would be thought wonderfully ill-bred, that &s;hould build upon &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as Encou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">agements, to expect from them any In&s;tance of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus are the true Cau&s;es of Living, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d Plea&s;ures of Life, lo&s;t in Show, Impo&s;ture, and Impertinence. As for my Part, I think mo&s;t of the Misfortunes in Families ari&s;e from the trifling Way the Women have in &s;pending their Time, and gratifying only their Eyes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, in&s;tead of their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>A fine young Woman, bred under a Vi&s;iting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ther knows all that is po&s;&s;ible for her to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ainted with by Report, and &s;ees the Virtuous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d the Vicious u&s;ed &s;o indifferently, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs &s;he is born with are abated, and De&s;ires in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ged, in Proportion to her Love of that light and tri&s;ling Conver&s;ation.

<P>AS &s;oon as I had placed my &s;elf in my Chair of Jud cature, I order'd my Clerk Mr. <HI>Lil|lie</HI> to read to the A&s;&s;embly (who were gather'd together according to Notice) a certain Declara|tion, by Way of Charge, to open the Purpo&s;e of my Se&s;&s;ion, which tended only to this Explana|tion, That as other Courts were often called to demand the Execution of Per&s;ons dead in Law,
<PB N="363" REF="368">
&s;o this was held to give the la&s;t Orders relating to tho&s;e who are dead in Rea&s;on. The Solicitor of the new Company of Upholders near the <HI>Hay|market</HI> appeared in Behalf of that u&s;eful Society, and brought in an Accu&s;ation of a young Wo|man, who her &s;elf &s;tood at the Bar before me. Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> read her Indictment, which was in Sub&s;tance, That whereas Mrs. <HI>Rebecca Pindu&s;t,</HI> of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martin in the Fields,</HI> had, by the U&s;e of one In&s;trument called a Looking|gla&s;s, and by the further U&s;e of certain Attire, made either of Cambrick, Mu&s;lin, or other Li|nen Wares, upon her Head, attained to &s;uch an evil Art and Magical Force in the Motion of her Eyes and Turn of her Countenance, that &s;he the &s;aid <HI>Rebecca</HI> had put to Death &s;everal young Men of the &s;aid Pari&s;h; and that the &s;aid young Men had acknowledged in certain Papers, commonly called Love Letters, (which were produced in Court, gilded on the Edges, and &s;ealed with a particular Wax, with certain amorous and en|chanting Words wrought upon the &s;aid Seals) that they died for the &s;aid <HI>Rebecca:</HI> And whereas the &s;aid <HI>Rebecca</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;aid evil Pra|ctice; this Way of Life the &s;aid Society con&s;tru|ed to be, according to former Edicts, a State of Death, and demanded an Order for the Interr|ment of the &s;aid <HI>Rebecca.</HI></P>
<P>I looked upon the Maid with great Humanity, and de&s;ired her to make An&s;wer to what was &s;aid again&s;t her. She &s;aid, It was indeed true, that the had practi&s;ed all the Arts and Means &s;he could to di&s;po&s;e of her &s;elf happily in Marriage, but thought &s;he did not come under the Cen|&s;ure expre&s;&s;ed in my Writings for the &s;ame; and humbly hoped, I would not condemn her for the Ignorance of her Accu&s;ers, who according to their own Words, had rather repre&s;ented her kil|ling, than dead. She further alledged, That the Expre&s;&s;ions mentioned in the Papers written to
<PB N="364" REF="369">
her, were become meer Words, and that &s;he had been always ready to marry any of tho&s;e who &s;aid they died for her; but that they made their E&s;cape as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves pitied or believed. She ended her Di&s;cour&s;e, by de&s;i|ring I would for the future &s;ettle the Meaning of the Words, <HI>I Die,</HI> in Letters of Love.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pindu&s;t</HI> behaved her &s;elf with &s;uch an Air of Innocence, that &s;he ea&s;ily gained Credit, and was acquitted. Upon which Occa&s;ion, I gave it as a &s;tanding Rule. That any Per&s;ons, who in any Letter. Billet, or Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hould tell a Woman he died for her, &s;hould, if &s;he plea&s;ed, be obliged to live with her, or be immediately interred upon &s;uch their own Confe&s;&s;ion, without Bail or Main|prize.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that the very next who was brought before me was one of her Admirers, who was indicted upon that very Head. A Let|ter which he acknowledged to be his own Hand was read; in which were the following Words; <HI>Cruel Creature, I die for you</HI> It was ob&s;ervable that he took Snuff all the Time his Accu&s;ation was reading. I asked him, How he came to u&s;e the&s;e Words, if he were not a dead Man? He told me, He was in Love with the Lady, and did not know any other Way of telling her &s;o; and that all his Acquaintance took the &s;ame Method. Tho' I was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion towards him by rea&s;on of the Weakne&s;s of his Parts, yet for Example's Sake, I was forced to an&s;wer, Your Sentence &s;hall be a Warning to all the re&s;t of your Companions; not to tell Lies for want of Wit. Upon this, he began to beat his Snuff|box with a very &s;awcy Air; and opening it again, Faith <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;aid he, thou art a very unac|countable old Fellow&mdash;Prithee, who gave thee Power of Life and Death? What-a-Pox ha&s;t thou to do with Ladies and Lovers? I &s;uppo&s;e thou would&s;t have a Man be in Company with his Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="365" REF="370">
and &s;ay nothing to her. Do&s;t thou call breaking a Je&s;t, telling a Lie? Ha! Is that thy Wi&s;dom, old Stiffrump, ha? He was going on with this in&s;ipid Common-place Mirth, &s;ometimes opening his Box, &s;ometimes &s;hutting it, then viewing the Picture on the Lid, and then the Workman&s;hip of the Hinge, when in the mid&s;t of his Eloquence, I order'd his Box to be taken from him; upon which he was immediately &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s, and carried off &s;tone-dead.</P>
<P>The next who appeared, was a hale old Fel|low of Sixty. He was brought in by his Rela|tions, who de&s;ired Leave to bury him. Upon re|quiring a di&s;tinct Account of the Pri&s;oner, a cre|dible Witne&s;s depo&s;ed, That he always ro&s;e at Ten of the Clock, played with his Car till Twelve, &s;moaked Tobacco till One, was at Din|ner till Two, then took another Pipe, played at Backgammon till Six, talked of one Madam <HI>Frances,</HI> an old Mi&s;tre&s;s of his, till Eight, re|peated the &s;ame Account at the Tavern till Ten, then returned Home, took t'other Pipe, and then to Bed. I asked him, What he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf? As to what (&s;aid he) they mention concerning Madam <HI>Frances</HI>&mdash;I did not care for hearing a <HI>Canterbury</HI> Tale, and therefore thought my &s;elf &s;ea&s;onably interrupted by a young Gen|tleman, who appeared in the Behalf of the old Man, and prayed an Arre&s;t of Judgment; for that he the &s;aid young Man held certain Lands by his the &s;aid old Man's Life. Upon this, the Solicitor of the Upholders took an Occa&s;ion to demand him al&s;o, and thereupon produced &s;eve|ral Evidences that witne&s;&s;ed to his Life and Con|ver&s;ation. It appeared, That each of them divi|ded their Hours in Matters of equal Moment and Importance to them&s;elves and to the Publick. They ro&s;e at the &s;ame Hour: While the old Man was playing with his Cat, the young One was looking out of his Window; while the old Man
<PB N="366" REF="371">
was &s;moaking his Pipe, the young Man was rub|bing his Teeth; while One was at Dinner, the Other was dre&s;&s;ing; while One was at Back|gammon, the Other was at Dinner; while the old Fellow was talking of Madam <HI>Frances,</HI> the young One was either at Play, or toa&s;ting Women whom he never convers'd with. The only Difference was, That the young Man had never been good for any Thing; the old Man, a Man of Worth be|fore he knew Madam <HI>Frances.</HI> Upon the Whole, I order'd them to be both interred together, with In&s;criptions proper to their Characters, &s;ignifying, That the old Man died in the Year 1689, and was buried in the Year 1709. And over the young One it was &s;aid, That he departed this World in the 25th Year of his Death.</P>
<P>The next Cla&s;s of Criminals, were Authors in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e. Tho&s;e of them who had pro|duced any &s;till-born Work, were immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to their Burial, and were followed by others, who, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;prightly I&s;|&s;ue in their Life-time, had given Proofs of their Death by &s;ome Po&s;thumous Children, that bore no Re&s;emblance to their elder Brethren. As for tho&s;e who were the Fathers of a mixed Progeny, provided always they could prove the la&s;t to be a live Child, they e&s;caped with Life, but not without Lo&s;s of Limbs; for in this Ca&s;e, I was &s;atisfied with Amputation of the Parts which were mortified.</P>
<P>The&s;e were followed by a great Crowd of &s;u|perannuated Benchers of the Inns of Court, Se|nior Fellows of Colleges, and defunct State&s;men: all whom I order'd to be decimated indifferent|ly, allowing the re&s;t a Reprieve for one Year, with a Promi&s;e of a free Pardon in ca&s;e of Re|&s;u&s;citation.</P>
<P>There were &s;till great Multitudes to be exami|ned; but finding it very late. I adjourned the Court; not without the &s;ecret Plea&s;ure that I had
<PB N="367" REF="372">
done my Duty, and furni&s;hed out an hand&s;ome Execution.</P>
<P>Going out of the Court, I received a Letter, informing me, That in Pur&s;uance of the Edict of Ju&s;tice in one of my late Vi&s;ions, all tho&s;e of the Fair Sex began to appear pregnant who had ran any Hazard of it; as was manife&s;t by a particu|lar Swelling in the Petticoats of &s;everal Ladies in and about this great City. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not attribute the Ri&s;ing of this Part of the Dre&s;s to this Occa&s;ion, yet mu&s;t own, that I am very much di&s;po&s;ed to be offended with &s;uch a new and unaccountable Fa&s;hion. I &s;hall however pro|nounce nothing upon it, till I have examined all that can be &s;aid for and again&s;t it. And in the mean Time, think fit to give this Notice to the fair Ladies who are now making up their Win|ter-Suits, that they may ab&s;tain from all Dre&s;&s;es of that Kind, till they &s;hall find what Judgment will be pa&s;&s;ed upon them; for it would very much trouble me, that they &s;hould put them&s;elves to an unnece&s;&s;ary Expence; and could not but think my &s;elf to blame, if I &s;hould hereafter forbid them the Wearing of &s;uch Garments, when they have laid out Money upon them, without having given them any previous Admonition.</P>

<P>THE Watchman, who does me particular Honours, as being the chief Man in the Lane, gave &s;o very great a Thump at my Door la&s;t Night, that I awakened at the Knock, and heard my &s;elf complimented with the u&s;ual Sa|kitation of, <HI>Good morrow Mr.</HI> Bicker&s;taff, <HI>Good morrow my Ma&s;ters all.</HI> The Silence and Dark|ne&s;s of the Night, di&s;po&s;ed me to be more than ordinarily &s;erious; and as my Attention was not drawn out among exterior Objects, by the Avo|cations of Sen&s;e, my Thoughts naturally fell up|on my &s;elf. I was con&s;idering, amid&s;t the Stil|ne&s;s of the Night What was the proper Employ|ment of a Thinking Being? What were the Per|fections it &s;hould propo&s;e to it &s;elf? And, What the End it &s;hould aim at? My Mind is of &s;uch a particular Ca&s;t, that the Falling of a Shower of Rain, or the Whi&s;tling of Wind, at &s;uch a Time, is apt to fill my Thoughts with &s;omething awful and &s;olemn. I was in this Di&s;po&s;ition, when our Bellman began his Midnight Homily (which he has been repeating to us every Winter Night for the&s;e Twenty Years) with the u&s;ual Exordium:
<Q><L>Oh! mortal Man, thou that art born in Sin!</L></Q>
Sentiments of this Nature, which are in them|&s;elves ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, however deba&s;ed by
<PB N="369" REF="374">
the Circum&s;tances that accompany them, do not fail to produce their natural Effect in a Mind that is not perverted and depraved by wrong No|tions of Gallantry, Politene&s;s, and Ridicule. The Temper which I now found my &s;elf in, as well as the Time of the Year, put me in Mind of tho&s;e Lines in <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> wherein, according to his agreeable Wildne&s;s of Imagination, he has wrought a Country Tradition into a beautiful Piece of Poetry. In the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where the Gho&s;t vani&s;hes upon the Cock's Crow|ing, he takes Occa&s;ion to mention its Crowing all Hours of the Night about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Time, and to in&s;inuate a Kind of religious Veneration for that Sea&s;on.</P>
<Q><L>It faded on the Crowing of the Cock.</L>
<L>Some &s;ay, That ever 'gain&s;t that Sea&s;on comes</L>
<L>Wherein our Saviour's Birth is celebrated,</L>
<L>The Bird of Dawning &s;ingeth all Night long;</L>
<L>And then, &s;ay they, no Spirit dares walk abroad:</L>
<L>The Nights are whole&s;ome, then no Planets &s;trike,</L>
<L>No Fairy takes, no Witch has Power to charm;</L>
<L>So hallowed, and &s;o gracious to the Time.</L></Q>
<P>This admirable Author, as well as the be&s;t and greate&s;t Men of all Ages, and of all Nations, &s;eems to have had his Mind throughly &s;ea&s;oned with Religion, as is evident by many Pa&s;&s;ages in his Plays, that would not be &s;uffered by a mo|dern Audience; and are therefore certain In|&s;tances, that the Age he lived in had a much greater Sen&s;e of Virtue than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is indeed a melancholy Reduction to con&s;ider, That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, which is now at a greater Height of Glory for its Councils and Conque&s;ts than it ever was before, &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h it &s;elf by a certain Loo&s;ene&s;s of Principles, and a Falling off from tho&s;e Schemes of Thinking, which con|duce to the Happine&s;s and Perfection of humane Nature. This Evil comes upon us from the Works
<PB N="370" REF="375">
of a few &s;olemn Blockheads, that meet together with the Zeal and Seriou&s;ne&s;s of Apo&s;tles, to ex|tirpate common Sen&s;e, and propagate Infidelity. The&s;e are the Wretches, who, without any Show of Wit, Learning, or Rea&s;on, publi&s;h their crude Conceptions with an Ambition of appearing more wi&s;e than the re&s;t of Mankind, upon no other Pre|tence, than that of di&s;&s;enting from them. One gets by Heart a Catalogue of Title Pages and Editions; and immediately to become con&s;picuous, declares that he is an Unbeliever. Another knows how to write a Receipt, or cut up a Dog, and forthwith argues again&s;t the Immortality of the Soul. I have known many a little Wit, in the O&s;tenta|tion of his Parts, rally the Truth of the Scripture, who was not able to read a Chapter in it. The&s;e poor Wretches talk Bla&s;phemy for want of Di&s;|cour&s;e, and are rather the Objects of Scorn or Pity, than of our Indignation; but the grave Di&s;|putant, that reads and writes, and &s;pends all his Time in convincing him&s;elf and the World, that he is no better than a Brute, ought to be whipped out of a Government, as a Blot to a civil Society, and a Defamer of Mankind. I love to con&s;ider an Infidel, whether di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Title of Dei&s;t, Athei&s;t, or Free-Thinker, in Three diffe|rent Lights, in his Solitudes, his Afflictions, and his la&s;t Moments.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e Man, that lives up to the Principles of Rea&s;on and Virtue, if one con&s;iders him in his Solitude, as taking in the Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, ob&s;erving the mutual Dependance and Harmony, by which the whole Frame of it hangs together, beating down his Pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;welling his Thoughts with magnificent Idea's of Providence, makes a nobler Figure in the Eye of an intelligent Being, than the greate&s;t Conqueror amid&s;t all the Pomps and Solemnities of a Triumph. On the contrary, there is not a more ridiculous Animal than an Athei&s;t in his Retirement. His Mind is incapable
<PB N="371" REF="376">
of Rapture or Elevation: He can only con&s;ider him&s;elf as an in&s;ignificant Figure in a Landskip, and wandring up and down in a Field or a Mea|dow, under the &s;ame Terms as the meane&s;t Ani|mals about him, and as &s;ubject to as total a Mor|tality as they, with this Aggravation, That he is the only one among&s;t 'em who lies under the Apprehen&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>In Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he mu&s;t be of all Creatures the mo&s;t helple&s;s and forlorn; he feels the whole Pre&s;&s;ure of a pre&s;ent Calamity, without being re|lieved by the Memory of any Thing that is pa&s;|&s;ed, or the Pro&s;pect of any Thing that is to come. Annihilation is the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that he pro|po&s;es to him&s;elf, and an Halter or a Pi&s;tol the only Refuge he can fly to. But if you would be|hold one of the&s;e Goomy Mi&s;creants in his poor|e&s;t Figure, you mu&s;t con&s;ider him under the Ter|rors, or at the Approach, of Death.</P>
<P>About Thirty Years ago I was a Shipboard with one of the&s;e Vermin, when there aro&s;e a brisk Gale, which could frighten no Body but him&s;elf. Upon the Rowling of the Ship he fell upon his Knees, and confe&s;&s;ed to the Chaplain, that he had been a vile Athei&s;t, and had denied a Supreme Being ever &s;ince he came to his E&s;tate. The good Man was a&s;toni|&s;hed, and a Report immediately ran thro' the Ship, That there was an Athei&s;t upon the Upper-Deck. Several of the common Seamen, who had never heard the Word before, thought it had been &s;ome &s;trange Fi&s;h; but they were more &s;urpri&s;ed when they &s;aw it was a Man, and heard out of his own Mouth, That he never beheved till that Day that there was a God. As he lay in the Agonies of Confe&s;&s;ion, one of the hone&s;t Tarrs whi&s;pered to the Boat&s;wain, That it would be a good Deed to heave him over Board. But we were now within Sight of Port, when of a &s;udden the Wind fell, and the Penitent relap&s;ed, begging all of us that
<PB N="372" REF="377">
were pre&s;ent, as we were Gentlemen, not to &s;ay any Thing of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He had not been a&s;hore above Two Days, when one of the Company began to rally him upon his Devotion on Shipboard, which the other denied in &s;o high Terms, that it produced the Lie on both Sides, and ended in a Duel. The Athei&s;t was run through the Body, and after &s;ome Lo&s;s of Blood, became as good a Chri&s;tian as he was at Sea, till he found that his Wound was not mortal. He is at pre&s;ent one of the Free Thinkers of the Age, and now writing a Pamphlet again&s;t &s;everal re|ceiv'd Opinions concerning the Exi&s;tence of Fairies.</P>
<P>As I have taken upon me to cen&s;ure the Faults of the Age and Country which I live in, I &s;hould have thought my &s;elf inexcu&s;able to have pa&s;&s;ed over this Crying one, which is the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall therefore from Time to Time give my Countrymen particular Cautions again&s;t this Di&s;temper of the Mind, that is almo&s;t become fa&s;hionable, and by that Means more likely to &s;pread. I have &s;omewhere either read or heard a very memorable Sentence, That a Man would be a mo&s;t in&s;upportable Mon&s;ter, &s;hould he have the Faults that are incident to his Years. Con&s;titution, Profe&s;&s;ion, Family, Religion, Age, and Country; and yet every Man is in Danger of them all. For this Rea&s;on, as I am an old Man, I take particular Care to avoid being covetous, and telling long Stories: As I am Cholerick, I forbear not only Swearing, but all Interjections of Fretting, as Pugh! Pi&s;h! and the like. As I am a Layman, I re&s;olve not to conceive an A ver&s;ion for a wi&s;e and a good Man, becau&s;e his Coat is of a different Colour from mine. As I am de|&s;cended of the ancient Family of the <HI>Bicker&s;taffs,</HI> I never call a Man of Merit an Up&s;tart. As a Pro|te&s;tant, I do not &s;uffer my Zeal &s;o far to tran&s;port me, as to name the Pope and the Devil together. As I am fallen into this degenerate Age, I guard
<PB N="373" REF="378">
my &s;elf particularly again&s;t the Folly I have been now &s;peaking of. And as I am an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> I am very cautious not to hate a Stranger, or de|&s;pi&s;e a poor <HI>Palatine.</HI></P>

<P>AS I was looking over my Letters this Morn|ing, I chanced to ca&s;t my Eye upon the following one, which came to my Hands about Two Months ago from an old Friend of mine, who, as I have &s;ince learned, was the Per&s;on that writ the agreeable Epi&s;tle in&s;erted in my Paper of the Third of the la&s;t Month. It is of the &s;ame Turn with the other, and may be look|ed upon as a Specimen of <HI>Right Country Letters.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis &s;ets out to you from my Summer-Hou&s;e up|on the Terras, where I am enjoying a few Hours Sun &s;hine, the &s;eanty &s;weet Remains of a fiue Autumn. The Year is almo&s;t at the lowe&s;t; &s;o that in all Appearance, the re&s;t of my Letters be|tween this and Spring will be dated from my Par|lour
<PB N="374" REF="379">
Fire, where the little fond Prattle of a Wife and Children will &s;o often break in upon the Con|nexion of my Thoughts, that you'll ea&s;ily di&s;cover it in my Style. If this Winter &s;hould prove as &s;evere as the la&s;t, I can tell you before-hand, that I am likely to be a very mi&s;erable Man, through the perver&s;e Temper of my elde&s;t Boy. When the Fro&s;t was in its Extremity, you mu&s;t know, that mo&s;t of the Black-birds, Robins, and Finches, of the Pari&s;h (who&s;e Mu&s;ick had entertained me in the Summer) took Refuge under my Roof. Upon this, my Care was, to ri&s;e every Morning before Day to &s;et open my Windows for the Reception of the Cold and the Hungry, whom at the &s;ame Time I relieved with a very plentiful Alms by &s;trewing Corn and Seeds upon the Floors and Shelves. But <HI>Dicky,</HI> without any Regard to the Laws of Ho&s;pitality, con&s;idered the Ca&s;ements as &s;o many Traps, and u&s;ed every Bird as a Pri&s;oner at Di&s;cretion. Never did Ty|rant exerci&s;e more various Cruelties: Some of the poor Creatures he cha&s;ed to Death about the Room; others he drove into the Jaws of a Blood-thir&s;ty Cat; and even in his great &s;t Acts of Mercy, either clipped the Wings, or &s;inged the Tails, of his inno|cent Captives. You'll laugh, when I tell you I &s;ympathiz'd with every Bird in its Misfortunes; but I believe y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">u'll think me in the Right for be|wailing the Child's unlucky Humour.

<P>The be&s;t Critick that ever wrote, &s;peaking of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer</HI> which appear extravagant or frivolous, &s;ays indeed that they are Dreams; but the Dreams of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> My Friend's Let|ter appears to me in the &s;ame Light. One &s;ees him in an idle Hour; but at the &s;ame Time in the idle Hour of a wi&s;e Man. A great Mind has &s;omething in it too &s;evere and forbidding that is not capable of giving it &s;elf &s;uch little Re|laxations, and of conde&s;cending to the&s;e agree|able Ways of Trifling. <HI>Tully,</HI> when he cele|brates the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius,</HI> who were the greate&s;t as well as the polite&s;t Men of their Age, repre&s;ents it as a beautiful Pa&s;|&s;age in their Retirement, that they u&s;ed to ga|ther up Shells on the Sea-&s;hore, and amu&s;e them&s;elves with the Variety of Shape and Co|lour, which they met with in tho&s;e little unre|garded Works of Nature. The great <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> could be a Companion to his own Children, and was &s;urprized by the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sparta,</HI> as he was riding among them upon an Hobby-Hor&s;e. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> indeed had no Play-Fellows of his own begetting; but is &s;aid to have pa&s;|&s;ed many of his Hours with little <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Boys at a Game of Marbles, not unlike our mod rn Taw. There is (methinks) a Plea&s;ure in &s;ee|ing great Men thus fall into the Rank of Man|kind, and entertain them&s;elves with Diver&s;ions and Amu&s;ements that are agreeable to the very weake&s;t of the Species. I mu&s;t frankly confe&s;s, that it is to me a Beauty in <HI>Cato</HI>'s Character, that he would drink a chearful Bottle with a Friend, and I cannot but own, that I have
<PB N="376" REF="381">
&s;een with great Delight one of the mo&s;t celebra|ted Authors of the la&s;t Age feeding the Ducks in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park. By In&s;tances or this Na|ture, the Heroes, the State&s;men, the Philo&s;o|phers, become as it were familiar with us, and grow the more amiable, the le&s;s they endeavour to appear awful. A Man who always acts in the Severity of Wi&s;dom, or the Haughtine&s;s of Quality, &s;eems to move in a per&s;onated art: It looks too Con&s;t ained and Theatrical for a Man to be always in that Character which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from others. Be&s;ides that, the Slackening and Unbending our Minds on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, makes them exert them&s;elves with greater Vi|gour and Alacrity, when they return to their pro|per and natural State.</P>
<P>As this innocent Way of pa&s;&s;ing a lei&s;ure Hour is not only con&s;i&s;tent with a great Chara|cter, but very graceful in it, &s;o there are Two Sorts of People to whom I would mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend it. The Fir&s;t, are tho&s;e who are un|ea&s;y out of Want of Thought; the Second, are tho&s;e who are &s;o out of a Turbulence of Spirit. The Fir&s;t a e the impertinent, and the Second the dangerous Part of Mankind.</P>
<P>It grieves me to the very Heart, when I &s;ee &s;everal young Gentlemen, de&s;cended of hone&s;t Parents, run up and down hurrying from one End of the Town to the other, calling in at every Place of Re&s;ort, without being able to fix a Qua ter of an Hour in any, and in a particular Ha&s;te without knowing for what. It would (methinks) be &s;ome Con&s;olation, if I could per|&s;wade the&s;e precipitate young Gentlemen to compo&s;e this Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of Mind, and apply them&s;elves to any Amu&s;ement, how trivial &s;o|ever, that might give them Employment, and keep them out of Harm's Way. They cannot imagine how great a Relief it would be to them, if they could grow &s;edate enough to play for
<PB N="377" REF="382">
Two or Three Hours at a Game of Pu&s;h-pin. But the&s;e bu&s;y, idle Animals, are only their own Tormentors: The Turbulent and Dangerous are for embroiling Councils, &s;tirring up Seditions, and &s;ubverting Con&s;titutions, out of a meer Re&s;t|le&s;ne&s;s of Temper, and an In&s;en&s;ibility of all the Plea&s;ures of Life that are calm and innocent. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to be &s;o much em|ployed in any Scene of Action, as to have great and good Affairs enough to fill up his whole Time; there will &s;till be Ca&s;ms and empty Spaces, in which a working Mind will employ it &s;elf to its own Prejudice, or that of others, un|le&s;s it can be at Ea&s;e in the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch Actions as are in them&s;elves indifferent. How often have I wi&s;hed, for the Good of the Na|tion, That &s;everal famous Politicians could take any Plea&s;ure in feeding Ducks. I look upon an able State&s;man out of Bu&s;ine&s;s like a huge Whale, that will endeavour to overturn the Ship, unle&s;s he has an empty Cask to play with.</P>
<P>But to return to my good Friend and Corre&s;|pondent, I am afraid we &s;hall both be laughed at, when I confe&s;s, that we have often gone out into the Field to look upon a Bird's-Ne&s;t; and have more than once taken an Evening's Walk together on purpo&s;e to &s;ee the Sun &s;et. I &s;hall conclude with my An&s;wer to his foregoing Let|ter:</P>

Part, I am excluded all Conver&s;ation with Am|mals that delight only in a Country Life, and am therefore forced to entertain my &s;elf as well as I can with my little Dog and Cat.

<P>I Was walking about my Chamber this Morn|ing in a very gay Humour, when I &s;aw a Coach &s;top at my Door, and a Youth about Fif|teen alighting out of it, whom I perceived to be the elde&s;t Son of my Bo&s;om-Friend that I gave &s;ome Account of in my Paper of the 17th of the la&s;t Month. I felt a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure ri&s;ing in me at the Sight of him, my Acquaintance having begun with his Father when he was ju&s;t &s;uch a Stripling, and about that very Age. When he came up to me, he took me by the Hand, and bur&s;t out in Tears. I was extremely moved, and immediately &s;aid, Child, How does your Father
<PB N="384" REF="389">
do? He began to reply, My Mother&mdash;But could not go on for weeping. I went down with him into the Coach, and gathered out of him, That his Mother was then dying, and that while the holy Man was doing the la&s;t Offices to her, he had taken that Time to come and call me to his Father, who (he &s;aid) would certainly break his Heart if I did not go and comfort him. The Child's Di&s;cretion in coming to me of his own Head, and the Tenderne&s;s he &s;howed for his Pa|rents, would have quite overpowered me, had I not re&s;olved to fortify my &s;elf for the &s;ea&s;onable Performances of tho&s;e Duties which I owed to my Friend. As we were going, I could not but reflect upon the Character of that excellent Wo|man, and the Greatne&s;s of his Grief for the Lo&s;s of one who has ever been the Support to him under all other Afflictions. How (thought I) will he be able to bear the Hour of her Death, that could not, when I was lately with him, &s;peak of a Sickne&s;s, which was then pa&s;t, without Sor|row. We were now got pretty far into <HI>We&s;tm n|&s;ter,</HI> and arrived at my Friend's Hou&s;e. At the Door of it I met <HI>Favonius,</HI> not without a &s;ecret Satisfaction to find he had been there. I had formerly conver&s;ed with him at this Hou&s;e; and as he abounds with that Sort of Virtue and Knowledge which makes Religion beautiful, and never leads the Conver&s;ation into the Vio|lence and Rage of Party-Di&s;putes, I li&s;tened to him with great Plea&s;ure. Our Di&s;cour&s;e chan|ced to be upon the Subject of Death, which he treated with &s;uch a Strength of Rea&s;on, and Greatne&s;s of Soul, that in&s;tead of being terrible, it appeared to a Mind rightly cultivated, altoge|ther to be contemned, or rather to be de&s;ired. As I met him at the Door, I &s;aw in his Face a certain Glowing of G ief and Humanity, heigh|ten'd with an Air of Fortitude and Re&s;olution, which, as I afterwards found, had &s;uch an irre|&s;i&s;tible
<PB N="385" REF="390">
Force, as to &s;u&s;pend the Pains of the Dy|ing, and the Lamentation of the neare&s;t Friends who attended her. I went up directly to the Room where &s;he lay, and was met at the En|trance by my Friend, who, notwith&s;tanding his Thoughts had been compo&s;ed a little before at the Sight of me, turned away his Face and wept. The little Family of Children renewed the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their Sorrow according to their &s;e|veral Ages and Degrees of Under&s;tanding. The elde&s;t Daughter was in Tears, bu&s;ied in Atten|dance upon her Mother; others were kneeling about the Bed-&s;ide: And what troubled me mo&s;t was, to &s;ee a little Boy, who was too young to know the Rea&s;on, weeping only becau&s;e his Si|&s;ters did. The only one in the Room who &s;eem|ed re&s;igned and comforted, was the dying Per|&s;on. At my Approach to the Bed-&s;ide, &s;he told me, with a low broken Voice, This is kindly done&mdash;Take Care of your Friend&mdash;Don't go from him. She had before taken Leave of her Husband and Children, in a Manner proper for &s;o &s;olemn a Parting, and with a Gracefulne&s;s peculiar to a Woman of her Character. My Heart was torn in Pieces to &s;ee the Husband on one Side &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and keeping down the Swellings of his Grief, for Fear of di&s;turbing her in her la&s;t Moments; and the Wife even at that Time concealing the Pains &s;he endured, for Fear of encrea&s;ing his Affliction. She kept her Eyes upon him for &s;ome Moments after &s;he grew &s;peechle&s;s, and &s;oon after clo&s;ed them for ever. In the Moment of her Departure, my Friend (who had thus far commanded him&s;elf) gave a deep Groan, and fell into a Swoon by her Bed|&s;ide. The Di&s;traction of the Children, who thought they &s;aw both their Parents expiring to|gether, and now lying dead before them, would have melted the harde&s;t Heart; but they &s;oon perceived their Father recover, whom I helped
<PB N="386" REF="391">
to remove into another Room, with a Re&s;olution to accompany him till the fir&s;t Pangs of his Af|fliction were abated. I knew Con&s;olation would now be impertinent; and therefore contented my &s;elf to &s;it by him, and condole with him in Si|lence. For I &s;hall here u&s;e the Method of an ancient Author, who in one of his Epi&s;tles rela|ting the Virtues and Death of <HI>Macrinus</HI>'s Wife, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend my Ad|vice to this be&s;t of Friends, till he is made capa|ble of receiving it by tho&s;e Three great Reme|dies, <HI>(Nece&s;&s;itas ip&s;a, Dies longa, &amp; Satietas Do|loris)</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity of Submi&s;&s;ion, Length of Time, and Satiety of Grief.'</Q></P>
<P>In the mean Time, I cannot but con&s;ider with much Commi&s;eration, the melancholy State of one who has had &s;uch a Part of him&s;elf torn from him, and which he mi&s;&s;es in every Cir|cum&s;tance of Life. His Condition is like that of one who has lately lo&s;t his Right Arm, and is every Moment offering to help him&s;elf with it. He does not appear to him&s;elf the &s;ame Per|&s;on in his Hou&s;e, at his Table, in Company, or in Retirement; and lo&s;es the Reli&s;h of all the Plea&s;ures and Diver&s;ious that were before enter|taining to him by her Participation of them. The mo&s;t agreeable Objects recall the Sorrow for her with whom he u&s;ed to enjoy them. This ad|ditional Satisfaction, from the Ta&s;t of Plea&s;ures in the Society of one we love, is admirably de|&s;cribed in <HI>Milton,</HI> who repre&s;ents <HI>Eve,</HI> though in Paradi&s;e it &s;elf, no further plea&s;ed with the beau|tiful Objects around her, than as &s;he &s;ees them in Company with <HI>Adam,</HI> in that Pa&s;&s;age &s;o inex|pre&s;&s;ibly charming.</P>
<Q><L>With Thee conver&s;ing, I forget all Time,</L>
<L>All Sea&s;ons, and their Change; all plea&s;e alike.</L>
<L>Sweet is the Breath of Morn, her Ri&s;ing &s;weet</L>

<P>The Variety of Images in this Pa&s;&s;age is in|finitely plea&s;ing, and the Recapitulation of each particular Image, with a little varying of the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, makes one of the fine&s;t Turns of Words that I have ever &s;een: Which I rather mention, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has &s;aid in his Preface to <HI>Ju|venal,</HI> That he could meet with no Turn of Words in <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>It may further be ob&s;erved, That though the Sweetne&s;s of the&s;e Ver&s;es has &s;omething in it of a Pa&s;toral, yet it excels the ordinary Kind, as much as the Scene of it is above an ordinary Field or Meadow. I might here, &s;ince I am ac|cidentally led into this Subject, &s;how &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages in <HI>Milton</HI> that have as excellent Turns of this Nature, as any of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets what&s;o|ever; but &s;hall only mention that which follows, in which he de&s;cribes the Fallen Angels engaged in the intricate Di&s;putes of Prede&s;tination, Free|will, and Fore-knowledge; and to humour the Perplexity, makes a Kind of Labyrinth in the very Words that de&s;cribe it.</P>
