<HEAD>THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, OR CHRISTIAN SUBMISSION to PERSONAL INJURIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE illegality of &s;lavery among Chri&s;tians is a point which I have long laboured to demon&s;trate, as being de&s;tructive of morality, and con|&s;equently dangerous both to body and &s;oul. There are neverthele&s;s &s;ome par|ticular Texts in the New Te&s;tament, which, in the opinion even of &s;everal well meaning and di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;ons, &s;eem to afford &s;ome proof of the tolera|tion of &s;lavery among the primitive Chri&s;tians; and, from thence, they are
<PB N="4" REF="3">induced to conceive, <HI>that Chri&s;tianity doth not oblige its profe&s;&s;ors to renounce the practice of &s;laveholding.</HI></P>
<P>A learned and reverend corre&s;pondent of mine &s;eems to have adopted this no|tion, and has &s;ignified his opinion near|ly to the &s;ame effect, in a private letter to me on this &s;ubject, to which I have not yet ventured to &s;end him a reply, though it is a con&s;iderable time &s;ince I received his letter; but, to &s;ay the truth, the que&s;tion in which I had never before apprehended any difficulty, was render|ed very &s;erious and important, upon my hands, by my friend's declaration; and I thought my&s;elf bound to give it the &s;tricte&s;t examination, becau&s;e I conceiv|ed (as I do &s;till) that the honour of the Holy Scriptures, which of all other things, I have mo&s;t at heart, was con|cerned in the determination of the point in que&s;tion; and yet I know, that my
<PB N="5" REF="4">friend is full as zealous for the honour of the Scriptures as my&s;elf, and much more learned in them, being very emi|nent in that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branch of knowledge.</P>
<P>I believe al&s;o that he is perfectly di&s;|intere&s;ted, and of undoubted <HI>Chri&s;tian benevolence.</HI> The objection has therefore acquired an accumulated weight from the authority and worth of the per&s;on who made it; and con&s;equently, it de|manded more circum&s;pection and read|ing, to an&s;wer it in any rea&s;onable time, than my &s;hort broken intervals of lei&s;ure (the only time that I was then ma&s;ter of) would permit me to be&s;tow upon it; and as &s;o much time has already elap&s;ed, the an&s;wer which I originally intended for my friend's private peru&s;al, &s;hall now be addre&s;&s;ed to all well meaning per&s;ons in general, who may have had the &s;ame motives for admitting in any degree the
<PB N="6" REF="5">legality of &s;lavery; and that there are many &s;uch (even among tho&s;e that are concerned in the practice of &s;lavehold|ing) the example of my di&s;intere&s;ted friend's opinion, and common charity, oblige me to &s;uppo&s;e. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider my friend's opinion as the com|mon excu&s;e of our American and We&s;t Indian brethren for tolerating &s;lavery a|among them.</P>
<Q><HI>I do not think</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that Chri&s;|tianity relea&s;ed &s;laves from the obligation they were under according to the cu&s;tom and law of the Countries, where it was propagated.</HI></Q>
<P>This objection to my general doctrine <HI>is</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t <HI>guarded</HI> terms; &mdash;&s;o <HI>guarded,</HI> that it obliges me to ac|knowledge, that the ob&s;ervation is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;trictly <HI>true.</HI> My pre|&s;ent attempt is not to confute, but
<PB N="7" REF="6">rather to demon&s;trate wherein this <HI>truth</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, which will afterwards enable me to point out &s;uch a due limitation of the doctrine, as will ren|der it entirely con&s;i&s;tent with the hypothe&s;is, which I have &s;o long labour|ed to maintain, viz. <HI>the ab&s;olute illega|lity of &s;lavery among Chri&s;tians,</HI></P>
<P>In conformity to my worthy friend's declaration I mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t (who&s;e <HI>Kingdom,</HI> he him&s;elf declared,&mdash;<Q><HI>is not of</HI> THIS WORLD.</Q> John xviii. 36.) had no <HI>expre&s;s</HI> commi&s;&s;ion to alter <HI>the</HI> TEMPO|RAL CONDITION OF MEN, but only to prepare them for a BETTER WORLD by the general doctrines of <HI>faith, hope, charity, peace and goodwill,</HI> (or univer|&s;al love and benevolence to all man|kind) <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to injuries, dependence up|on God,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which (though <HI>general</HI> doctrines) are amply and &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="8" REF="7">efficacious indeed, for the <HI>par|ticular</HI> reformation of ALL CONDITIONS OF MEN, when <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is not want|ing in the application of them; but the principal intention of the whole &s;y&s;|tem is evidently to draw men from the the cares and anxieties of <HI>this pre&s;ent life,</HI> to a better hope in the <HI>life to come,</HI> which is Chri&s;t's proper kingdom: Chri&s;tian &s;ervants therefore were of cour&s;e in&s;tructed to be <HI>patient,</HI> to be <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive</HI> to their ma&s;ters, <Q><HI>not only to the good and gentle, but al|&s;o</HI> to the <HI>froward.</HI></Q> So that even <HI>ill u&s;age</HI> does not ju&s;tify <HI>perver&s;ene&s;s</HI> of be|haviour in chri&s;tian &s;laves.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o frequently in|&s;i&s;ts upon the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of an unfeigned obedience in the behaviour of chri&s;tian &s;ervants to their ma&s;ters. <Q><HI>Let every man abide in the &s;ame calling wherein he was called.</HI></Q> <Q><HI>Art thou
<PB N="9" REF="8">called being a &s;ervant? care not for it;</HI></Q> &amp;c. 1 Cor. vii. 21. and again, <Q><HI>Ser|vants be obedient to them that are</HI> (your) <HI>ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h, with fear and trembling, in &s;inglene&s;s of your heart as unto Chri&s;t; not with eye &s;ervice, as men plea&s;ers, but as the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, doing the Will of God from the heart; with good will doing &s;ervice, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that what&s;oever good thing any man doeth, the &s;ame &s;hall he receive of the Lord, whe|ther he be bond or free,</HI>" Ephe&s;. vi 5-8. Again,</Q> <Q><HI>Servants obey in all things</HI> (your) <HI>ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h; not which eye &s;ervice, as men plea&s;ers, but in &s;inglene&s;s of heart fearing God: and whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI> Colo&s;. iii. 22, 23. The &s;ame apo&s;tle in&s;tructs <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> to recommend obedience to &s;er|vants, <HI>'Let as many &s;ervants</HI> (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) <HI>as are under the yoke, count
<PB N="10" REF="9">their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honour, that</HI> THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE BE NOT BLASPHEMED. <HI>And they that have believing ma&s;ters, let them not de&s;pi&s;e</HI> (them) BECAUSE THEY ARE BRETHREN; BUT RATHER DO (them) SERVICE, BECAUSE THEY ARE FAITHFUL AND BELOVED PAR|TAKERS OF THE BENEFIT. <HI>The&s;e things teach and exhort: If any man teach otherwi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole|&s;ome words,</HI> (even) <HI>the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the doctrine which is according to godline&s;s; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about que&s;tions, and &s;trifes of words, whereof cometh envy, &s;trife, railings, evil-furmi&s;ings, perver&s;e di&s;putings of men of corrupt minds, and de&s;titute of the truth, &s;uppo&s;ing that gain is godli|ne&s;s. From &s;uch withdraw thy&s;elf. But godline&s;s with contentment is great gain. for we brought nothing into</HI> (this) <HI>world,
<PB N="11" REF="10">and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.'</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 1 to 8.&mdash;And again he in&s;i&s;ts on the &s;ame doctrine, '(Exhort) <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>to be obedient unto their own ma&s;ters,</HI> (and) <HI>to plea&s;e</HI> (them) <HI>well in all</HI> things, <HI>not an&s;wering again, not pur|loining, but &s;hewing all good fidelity; that they may</HI> ADORN THE DOC|TRINE OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR IN ALL THINGS.</Q> Titus ii. 9, 10.</P>
<P>THESE Texts are amply &s;ufficient to prove the truth of my learned friend's a&s;&s;ertion, &s;o far as it relates to THE DUTY OF THE SLAVES THEMSELVES, but this <HI>ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> required of Chri&s;tian &s;ervants, by no means implies the <HI>legality</HI> of &s;laveholding ON THE PART OF THEIR MASTERS, which <HI>he</HI> &s;eems to apprehend.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">THE &s;lave violates no precepts of the go&s;pel by his abject condition, pro|vided that the &s;ame is <HI>involuntary</HI> (for if he can be made free, he is expre&s;sly commanded by the apo&s;tle to <HI>u&s;e it ra|ther</HI>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art thou called</HI> (being) <HI>a &s;ervant? care not for it;</HI> BUT IF THOU MAYEST BE MADE FREE, USE IT RA|THER. <HI>For he that is called in the lord</HI> (being) <HI>a &s;ervant, is the lord's freeman, &amp;c.</HI> <Q><HI>ye are bought with a price,</HI> BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN.</Q> 1 Cor. vii. 21-23.</NOTE>) but how the ma&s;ter who enfor|ces <HI>that involuntary &s;ervitude,</HI> can be &s;aid to act con&s;i&s;tently with the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, is a que&s;tion of a very dif|ferent nature, which I propo&s;e to ex|amine with all po&s;&s;ible care and impar|tiality, being no otherwi&s;e intere&s;ted in it, than as a Chri&s;tian who e&s;teems both ma&s;ters and &s;laves as brethren, and con|&s;equently, while he pities the unhappy <HI>temporal condition</HI> of the latter, is ex|tremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nxious for the <HI>eternal welfare</HI> of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">I HAVE already admitted, that CHRIS|TIANITY DOTH NOT RELEASE SLAVES, <Q><HI>from the obligation they were under ac|cording to the cu&s;tom and law of the countries where it was propagated,</HI></Q> agreeable to my learned friend's a&s;&s;er|tion, in favour of which I have pro|duced a variety of texts: but as <Q><HI>the rea&s;on of the law,</HI></Q> (according to a maxim of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> law) <Q><HI>is the life of the law,</HI></Q> we cannot with ju&s;tice draw any conclu&s;ion from thence, in fa|vour of the ma&s;ter's claim, till we have examined the principles, on which the doctrine <HI>of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> in the&s;e &s;everal texts, is founded; and we &s;hall find, up|on a general view of the whole, that the principal rea&s;on of enforcing the doctrine was not &s;o much becau&s;e the per&s;ons to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, <HI>were &s;laves,</HI> as becau&s;e they <HI>were Chri&s;|tians,</HI> and were to overcome EVIL
<PB N="14" REF="13">with GOOD, to the GLORY OF GOD <HI>and</HI> RELIGION.</P>
<P>THESE principles are clearly <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> in &s;everal of the&s;e very texts, and <HI>implied</HI> in all of them, viz. '<HI>That the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed.</HI>' (1 Tim. vi. 1.) and again, <Q><HI>that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savi|our</HI> IN ALL THINGS.</Q> (Titus ii. 10.) So that a zeal for the GLORY OF GOD, and of HIS RELIGION (the principles of the fir&s;t great commandment) is the appa|rent ground and &s;ole purpo&s;e of the Chri&s;tian <HI>&s;lave's</HI> SUBMISSION, which was therefore to be <Q>WITH SINGLE|NESS OF HEART AS UNTO CHRIST.</Q> <Q><HI>not with eye &s;ervice,</HI> AS MEN PLEASERS, <HI>but as</HI> THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST, <HI>doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing &s;ervice,</HI> AS TO THE LORD, <HI>and</HI> NOT TO MEN: <HI>knowing that what&s;oever good thing any man doeth, the &s;ame &s;hall</HI> HE RECEIVE OF THE
<PB N="15" REF="14">LORD, <HI>whether he</HI> BE BOND OR FREE.</Q> Ephe&s;. vi. 5-8. And again, the &s;ame apo&s;tle charges the &s;ervants among the Colo&s;&s;ians, to obey <Q><HI>not</HI> AS MEN PLEA|SERS, <HI>but in &s;inglene&s;s of heart,</HI> FEAR|ING GOD: <HI>and what&s;oever they do, to do it heartil, as</HI> TO THE LORD, <HI>and</HI> NOT UNTO MEN.</Q> Colo&s;&s;. iii. 2.</P>
<P>THUS it is plain that the &s;ervice was to be performed 'as TO THE LORD,' and 'NOT TO MEN,' and therefore it cannot be con&s;trued as an acknowledge|ment of any <HI>right,</HI> or <HI>property</HI> really ve&s;ted <HI>in the ma&s;ter.</HI> This will clearly appear upon a clo&s;er examination of &s;ome of the&s;e texts. In the fir&s;t, for in&s;tance, though the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> enforces the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;er|vants <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> to their ma&s;ters, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, commanding them to be &s;ubject <Q><HI>not only to the good and gentle, but</HI> ALSO TO THE FROWARD,</Q> &amp;c. (1. Pet. ii. 18.)
<PB N="16" REF="15">yet he adds in the very next ver&s;e,&mdash;<Q><HI>for this is thank worthy, if a man,</HI> FOR CONSCIENCE TOWARDS GOD, <HI>endure grief,</HI> SUFFERING <HI>wrongfully,</HI></Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;o that, it is manife&s;t, the apo&s;|tle did not mean to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the claim of the ma&s;ters, becau&s;e he enjoin|ed the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;er|vants that &s;uffered <HI>wrongfully,</HI> as to tho&s;e who had good and gentle ma&s;ters: and it would be highly injurious to the <HI>go&s;pel of peace,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e it capable of authorizing <HI>wrongful &s;ufferings,</HI> or of e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>right</HI> or power in any rank of men whatever, to oppre&s;s others <HI>unju&s;tly,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">! And though the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> al&s;o, &s;o &s;trongly exhorts &s;ervants to &s;ub|mit to their ma&s;ters, and <Q><HI>to abide in the &s;ame calling wherein they were call|ed,</HI></Q> and '<HI>not to care for it.</HI>' (1 Corin|thians, vii. 20, 21.) Yet at the &s;ame time he clearly in&s;tructs them, that it is their duty to prefer a &s;tate of <HI>freedom</HI> whenever they can fairly and hone&s;tly
<PB N="17" REF="16">obtain it; <Q><HI>but if thou maye&s;t be made free</HI> (&s;ays he) USE IT RATHER.</Q> (v.21.) And the rea&s;on, which he a&s;&s;igns for this command, is as plainly delivered, viz. <HI>the equality of &s;ervants with their ma&s;ters in the fight of the Almighty,</HI> <Q><HI>For he that is called in the Lord,</HI> (being) <HI>a SER|VANT</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>is the Lord's FREE|MAN:</HI> LIKEWISE, <HI>al&s;o he that is call|ed</HI> (being) FREE, <HI>is Chri&s;t's</HI> SERVANT.</Q> (ver&s;e 22.) <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> having purcha&s;ed all men to be his <HI>peculiar &s;ervants,</HI> or ra|ther <HI>freemen.</HI> <Q><HI>Ye are bought with a price</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, in the 23d ver&s;e.) BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN,</Q> which plainly implies, that it is incon|&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of a Chri&s;tian, who is the <HI>&s;ervant</HI> or <HI>freeman of</HI> GOD, to be held in an <HI>unlimited</HI> &s;ubjection, as the bond <HI>&s;ervant</HI> or <HI>&s;lave of a</HI> MAN; and, con&s;equently, that a toleration of &s;lavery, in places where Chri&s;tianity is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, is intirely illegal;
<PB N="18" REF="17">for tho' THE SLAVE commits no crime by &s;ubmitting to the <HI>involuntary &s;ervice,</HI> (which has been already demon&s;trated,) yet the CHRISTIAN MASTER is guilty of a &s;ort of &s;acriledge, by appropria|ting to him&s;elf, as an <HI>ab&s;olute property,</HI> that body, which <HI>peculiarly belongs to God by an ine&s;timable purcha&s;e!</HI> For if God &s;aid of the Jews, even under the old law, (Levit. xxv. 52.) <Q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, <HI>which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt;</HI> THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">My learned friend, (mentioned in the beginning of this Tract) has remarked that <Q><HI>tho' God expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf concerning the Jews under the law in this manner.</HI> <Q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, WHICH I BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</Q> &amp;c. yet <HI>This did not &s;ignify</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that they were not to be &s;laves at all. They might be &s;laves for &s;even years, as is well known, notwith&s;tanding they were God's redeemed &s;er|vants. Nay, they might remain &s;laves 'till the jubilee,</HI> WITH THEIR OWN CONSENT, <HI>at the expiration of that &s;hort term of involuntary &s;ervitude. The&s;e words indeed contained a declaration that none of the I&s;raelites were to be &s;laves for ever like the Heathen. But what a &s;lip|pery proof,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>of this exemption with regard to Chri&s;tians? How dangerous</HI> (continued he,) <HI>is it to build doctrines upon &s;uch parallels and compari&s;ons!</HI></Q> But my worthy friend &s;eems to forget that the kind of &s;la|very which I oppo&s;e, is not that <HI>limited temporary &s;ervi|tude,</HI> which he de&s;cribes <HI>as con&s;i&s;tent with the law,</HI> for that differs very little from the condition of <HI>hired &s;er|vants,</HI> in which light, the Hebrew ma&s;ters were <HI>bound by the law,</HI> to look upon their brethren, even though bought with their money as bond &s;ervants or &s;laves, <Q><HI>If thy brother</HI> (that dwelleth) <HI>by thee be waxen poor,</HI> and BE SOLD <HI>unto thee;</HI> THOU SHATL NOT COMPEL HIM TO SERVE AS A BOND SERVANT: (but) AS AN HIRED SERVANT AND AS A SOJOURNER, <HI>he &s;hall be with thee,</HI> and <HI>&s;hall &s;erve thee unto the year of</HI> Jubile. <HI>And then &s;hall he depart from thee,</HI> (both) <HI>he and his children with him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For they are my &s;ervants,</HI> (&s;aid the Almighty) THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BOND-MEN. THOU SHALT NOT RULE OVER HIM WITH RI|GOUR, <HI>but &s;halt fear thy God.</HI></Q> Levit. xxv. 39, 43. Here is the very <HI>text,</HI> (with it's <HI>context</HI>) which I had quoted, to &s;hew the <HI>illegality</HI> of holding a <HI>brother</HI> I&s;|raelite in ab&s;olute &s;lavery, and as I have el&s;ewere fully demon&s;trated that men of all nations are to be con&s;idered as <HI>brethren</HI> under the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, &s;o my learned friend &s;urely does great inju&s;tice to the argument, when he calls it <Q><HI>a &s;lip|pery proof</HI> of <HI>this exemption with regard to Chri&s;|tians,</HI></Q> and a&s;&s;erts that the text in que&s;tion <HI>does not &s;ig|nify that they</HI> (the I&s;raelites) <HI>were not to be &s;laves at all!</HI> It clearly <HI>&s;ignifies</HI> however, that what&s;oever <HI>right</HI> a ma&s;ter might have acquired (even by an ab&s;olute <HI>pur|cha&s;e</HI>) over his Hebrew brother, yet that he was &s;till required to treat him as an <HI>hired &s;ervant,</HI> and to di&s;|charge <HI>him</HI> and <HI>his</HI> at a <HI>limited time:</HI> and when we com|pare it with the parallel text in Deuterenomy, (xv, 12, 14.) we find the ma&s;ter is there &s;trictly enjoined to reward the Bond-man LIBERALLY for his pa&s;t &s;ervices, viz. <Q><HI>And when thou &s;ende&s;t him out free from thee,</HI> THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY <HI>out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine pre&s;s,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Surely when the true nature of &s;uch <HI>limited &s;ervitude</HI> is duly con&s;idered, it affords but '<HI>a &s;lippery</HI> proof,' (if I may u&s;e my friend's expre&s;&s;ion) <Q>that <HI>they were to be &s;laves at all,</HI></Q> at lea&s;t, '<HI>at all,</HI>' in the &s;en&s;e con|tended for by our American and We&s;t India &s;lave|holders (which is the only matter in di&s;pute at pre|&s;ent) e&s;pecially as the condition of a <HI>hired &s;ervant</HI> is expre&s;sly mentioned, as the rank in which &s;uch Bond|men were to be e&s;teemed.

Many learned men (and Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> among the re&s;t) have con&s;trued the words &mdash; '<GAP DESC="foreign">, (1 Tim. vi. 2,)
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e words are tran&s;lated by Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> as follows, &mdash; <Q><HI>becau&s;e they who help to do good, are faithful and beloved,</HI></Q> and he u&s;es &s;everal arguments to &s;hew that the&s;e epithets refer <HI>to the &s;ervants,</HI> rather than <HI>to the ma&s;ters.</HI></NOTE> in a very different manner from the common ver&s;ion, and applied them <HI>to the &s;ervants,</HI> which entirely de&s;troys the pre&s;umption in favour of the &s;lave|holder.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I have contented my&s;elf with the common rendering, being con|vinced
<PB N="29" REF="28">that no conclu&s;ions can fairly be drawn from this text in favour of Sla|very, even when the epithets <Q><HI>faith|ful and beloved,</HI></Q> &amp;c. are applied <HI>to the Ma&s;ters;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ignification of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be re&s;trained within the bounds of <HI>go&s;pel doctrine;</HI> and, therefore, we cannot conceive that the apo&s;tle intended, by the applica|tion of the&s;e epithets, to ju&s;tify any practices which are incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the benevolence</HI> enjoined in other parts of the New Te&s;tament; for this would be liable to produce a contrary effect from that which the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;ly intended by his injunction, viz. that <HI>"the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed."</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, I hope, that the principles, on which the doctrine of the <HI>&s;ervants &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> is founded, are clear|ly expre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that <HI>Slaveholders</HI> can have no right to avail them&s;elves of any

<P>But my learned friend has entirely mi&s;under&s;tood the purport and intention of my arguments on the&s;e &s;everal texts relating to <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</HI> I have not attempted to prove, <HI>by the&s;e particular expre&s;&s;ions of the apo&s;tle,</HI> that <Q><HI>the connexion between Ma&s;ters and Slaves was looked upon by him as ab&s;olutely unlawful,</HI> &s;o that the former had <HI>no right to rule the latter;</HI></Q> for this I have demon&s;trated, I tru&s;t, by OTHER AUTHORI|TIES <HI>of Scripture</HI> equally authentic, and much le&s;s liable to be mi&s;under&s;tood. My attempt to explain the texts in que&s;tion extends no farther than to &s;hew that they do not really <HI>ju&s;tify the uncharitable claims of the modern Slaveholders,</HI> though they are frequently cited for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>An attempt to &s;hew <HI>that any particular doctrine is</HI> NOT NECESSARILY IMPLIED <HI>in a certain text or texts of Scrip|ture,</HI> is a very different thing from an attempt to PROVE or AUTHENTICATE AN OPPOSITE DOCTRINE <HI>by the &s;ame text of Scripture!</HI> For in&s;tance, when my learned friend a&s;&s;erts, as above, that the apo&s;tle to the Colo&s;|&s;ians, iii. 25. <Q><HI>very clearly &s;ignifies that the right of do|minion remained, when he oppo&s;es</HI> DOING WRONG to OBEYING <HI>in all things their Ma&s;ters,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

<P>The &s;ervants are indeed expre&s;sly and plainly ex|horted to <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as well in this as in all the other texts before recited, &s;o that a contrary behaviour in them might certainly be e&s;teemed a <Q><HI>do|ing wrong</HI></Q> on their part yet this by no means implies <HI>"a right of dominion"</HI> ve&s;ted in the Ma&s;ter; for that would prove too much; becau&s;e the like &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion is el&s;ewhere equally enjoined to tho&s;e who are expre&s;sly &s;aid to <Q><HI>endure grief,</HI> SUFFERING WRONG|FULLY,</Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign">,) and we cannot &s;uppo&s;e (as I have before ob&s;erved) that the <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion enjoined</HI> implies a <HI>right</HI> in the Ma&s;ter to exerci&s;e &s;uch a <HI>dominion</HI> as that of <HI>oppre&s;&s;ing others</HI> UNJUSTLY, or <GAP DESC="foreign">; for that could not po&s;&s;ibly tend to promote the declared purpo&s;es of the apo&s;tle's exhortations, viz. <HI>"that the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed,"</HI> (1 Tim. vi.) and again, <Q><HI>that they may adorn the doctrine of God in all</HI> THINGS,</Q> (Titus ii. 9.) The&s;e purpo&s;es, how|ever, are fully an&s;wered in the advice given by the &s;ame apo&s;tle to all the other <HI>different relations of life</HI> men|tioned by my worthy friend. WIVES may <Q><HI>adorn the doctrine of God</HI></Q> by SUBMISSION to their <Q><HI>own hu&s;bands, as it is fit in the Lord.</HI></Q> (See Colo&s;&s;. iii. 18.) And HUSBANDS, by <HI>love</HI> to their <HI>wives:</HI> for they are expre&s;sly charged in the following ver&s;e <Q><HI>not to be bitter again&s;t them,</HI></Q> that is, they mu&s;t, by <HI>love</HI> and <HI>&s;incere affection,</HI> moderate and &s;often that &s;upreme authority with which <HI>hu&s;bands</HI> are entru&s;ted, (by the laws of God and man,) that they may <HI>rule</HI> rather by the gentle influence of an inviolable <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fidelity,</HI> as &s;o good an example will &s;eldom fail to produce <HI>due re&s;pect,</HI> and will certainly <HI>"adorn the doctrine"</HI> or profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian. CHILDREN <Q><HI>may adorn the doctrine of God</HI></Q> by OBEDIENCE <HI>to their</HI> <Q><HI>parents in all things, for this is well-plea&s;ing</HI> (&s;ays the text) <HI>unto the Lord.</HI></Q> (v. 20.) And again, the reciprocal duty of FATHERS is plainly pointed out to be a prudent modera|tion of that <HI>paternal</HI> authority with which they are en|tru&s;ted, for they are carefully warned again&s;t an arbi|trary &s;everity, <Q><HI>Provoke not</HI> (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) <HI>your children to anger, le&s;t they be di&s;couraged.</HI></Q> SERVANTS are in the very next ver&s;e (v. 22.) commanded to <Q><HI>obey in all things their Ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h, not with eye-&s;ervice, as</HI> MEN-PLEASERS, <HI>but in &s;inglene&s;s of heart,</HI> FEARING GOD:</Q> &s;o that the SUBMISSION of the &s;ervants was al&s;o to <HI>adorn the "doctrine of God,"</HI> it being manife&s;tly enjoined only for <HI>God's &s;ake,</HI> and not on account of any &s;uppo&s;ed "RIGHT OF DOMINION" inve&s;ted in the <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> which the following ver&s;es (v. 23, and 24.) when <HI>applied to</HI> THE SERVANTS, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate,&mdash;<Q>And <HI>what&s;oever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, and</HI> NOT UNTO MEN: <HI>knowing, that of</HI> THE LORD <HI>ye &s;hall receive</HI> THE REWARD OF THE INHE|RITANCE: <HI>for</HI> YE SERVE THE LORD CHRIST.</Q> And to the &s;ame eternal and unerring Di&s;pen&s;er of <HI>Re|wards</HI> (and not to <HI>temporal Ma&s;ters</HI>) is attributed the power of puni&s;hing the <HI>"doing wrong,"</HI> mentioned in the very next ver&s;e; which, according to my learned friend's notion, is <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to <HI>obeying in all things the Ma&s;ters;</HI>&mdash;<Q><HI>he that</HI> DOETH WRONG (&s;ays the text) <HI>&s;hall receive for</HI> THE WRONG <HI>which he hath done: and</HI> THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</Q> (v. 25.)</P>
<P>Such &s;trict <HI>impartiality</HI> in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice cannot always be attributed, with certainty, even to the be&s;t-regulated <HI>human</HI> tribunal, and much le&s;s is it applicable to the deci&s;ions of uncontrouled <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> in puni&s;hing <HI>"wrong doing,"</HI> under the ab|&s;olute <HI>dominion</HI> of Slaveholders! No earthly <HI>dominion</HI> whatever is conducted with &s;uch an equal di&s;tribution of <HI>rewards</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hments,</HI> as that it may always with truth be &s;aid, <HI>"there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons,"</HI> for this is the proper characteri&s;tic of the <HI>judgements and do|minion</HI> of GOD and CHRIST alone. <Q><HI>For</HI> THE LORD <HI>is</HI> JUDGE, <HI>and with him is</HI> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</Q> Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus xxxv. 12. "<HI>For there is</HI> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS <HI>with</HI> GOD." Rom. ii. 11. And, there|fore, we may fairly conclude that the puni&s;hment, not only of SLAVES, but that al&s;o of MASTERS, that <HI>"do wrong,"</HI> is to be under&s;tood in the text which my friend has cited to &s;upport his notion of a <Q><HI>right of dominion</HI></Q> ve&s;ted in the <HI>Ma&s;ters;</HI> &s;o that the &s;aid &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>right</HI> has, indeed, but a very <HI>"&s;lippery"</HI> foundation! Agreeable to my la&s;t remark on this text, (Colo&s;&s;. iii. 24.) the learned Dr. Whitby has com|mented upon it, as if he thought it exactly parallel to another declaration of the &s;ame apo&s;tle, (viz. Ephe&s;. vi. 8 and 9.) wherein not only both <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Ser|vants</HI> are unque&s;tionably included, but al&s;o the <HI>domi|nion,</HI> or <HI>judgement,</HI> in <HI>which</HI> <Q>THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS,</Q> is expre&s;sly attributed to our <Q>MAS|TER IN HEAVEN.</Q> &mdash; <Q><HI>Chri&s;t, in judging men at the la&s;t day,</HI> (&s;ays the Doctor,) <HI>will have</HI> NO RESPECT <HI>to the quality or external condition of any man's per&s;on; but,</HI> WHETHER HE BE BOND OR FREE, <HI>he &s;hall receive recompence</HI> FOR THE GOOD THAT HE HATH DONE, <HI>in obedience to him; whether he be</HI> MASTER <HI>or</HI> SERVANT, <HI>he &s;hall be puni&s;hed for</HI> THE WRONG THAT HE DOTH <HI>in tho&s;e relations.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If all the&s;e circum&s;tances be duly con&s;idered, it will manife&s;tly appear, I tru&s;t, that the Ma&s;ters &s;up|po&s;ed <HI>"right of dominion"</HI> (which, certainly, is <HI>not</HI> EXPRESSED in the text) cannot even be <HI>implied</HI> in the&s;e contexts, nor in any of the parallel pa&s;&s;ages al|ready recited!

<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot">(20) To the example of the patriotic apo&s;tle, Paul, upon this point, I mu&s;t now add that of another cho|&s;en ve&s;&s;el of Chri&s;t, the protomartyr <HI>Stephen:</HI> this excellent man, <HI>"full of the Holy Gho&s;t and wi&s;dom,"</HI> (Acts vi. 3.) <HI>"full of faith and power,"</HI> (v. 8.) <Q><HI>and who&s;e wi&s;dom and &s;pirit none were able to re&s;i&s;t:</HI></Q> (v. 10.)&mdash;This excellent man, I &s;ay, has left us by his own example an unque&s;tionable precedent on re|cord to demon&s;trate that HONOUR IS NOT DUE to the highe&s;t temporal authority on earth, not even to a <HI>great national council of rulers and elders,</HI> while they ex|erci&s;e their authority in <HI>unju&s;t</HI> pro&s;ecutions, and abu&s;e their power by enacting <HI>unrea&s;onable and tyrannical or|dinances.</HI> The great council of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate had <HI>"&s;traightly commanded"</HI> the apo&s;ties and di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t (as I have already remarked in a preceding note) <Q><HI>not to &s;peak at all, nor teach in the name of Je&s;us;</HI></Q> which command, it &s;eems, was given le&s;t their preaching &s;hould <HI>"bring this man's blood"</HI> (&s;aid the high prie&s;t, meaning the blood of our LORD JESUS) <HI>"upon us:"</HI> but <HI>Stephen</HI> paid &s;o little regard either to the <HI>unlawful</HI> command it&s;elf, or to the rea&s;on of it, that he afterwards publicly upbraided the whole coun|cil, with the high prie&s;t at the head of it, (in the mo&s;t &s;timulating and unre&s;erved terms,) as the betrayers and murderers of that ju&s;t One!&mdash;<Q><HI>Ye &s;tiff-necked, and un|circumci&s;ed in heart and ears,</HI></Q> (&s;aid he to their faces in the public a&s;&s;embly,) <Q><HI>ye do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t: as your fathers</HI> (did), <HI>&s;o</HI> (do) <HI>ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers per&s;ecuted? And they have &s;lain them which &s;hewed before of the coming of the</HI> JUST ONE, <HI>of whom ye have been now the</HI> BETRAY|ERS <HI>and</HI> MURDERERS,</Q> &amp;c. (Acts vii. 51 and 52.) Words could not well be <HI>&s;harper</HI> than the&s;e, which is manife&s;t from their <HI>effect;</HI> for the text te&s;tifies that <Q><HI>when they heard the&s;e things they were</HI> CUT TO THE HEART, <HI>and they gna&s;hed on him with</HI> (their) <HI>teeth.</HI></Q> (V. 54.) Thus it clearly appears that the holy, inno|cent, and meek Stephen did not think him&s;elf bound (like our undi&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>pa&s;&s;ive-obedience</HI> men) to <Q><HI>&s;ub|mit to every ordinance of man,</HI></Q> &amp;c. nor to <Q><HI>honour all men,</HI></Q> without making rea&s;onable and due excep|tions! Nay, &s;o far from <HI>honouring</HI> men merely on account of their <HI>temporal dignity,</HI> it is manife&s;t that he treated the whole <HI>body of rulers</HI> with the utmo&s;t &s;everity and contempt, while he thought them <HI>unworthy of honour,</HI> and yet there is no doubt but that he mo&s;t con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly, on every occa&s;ion, rendered <Q><HI>honour to whom honour</HI></Q> WAS DUE!</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="83">But what men (it will be &s;aid) are to be e&s;teemed the proper <HI>judges of de&s;ert</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;o as to determine with propriety when <HI>honour</HI> is or is not to be rendered? To which I an&s;wer, &mdash; <HI>Every man</HI> is a judge of it if he be not an idiot or mad man! <HI>Every man</HI> of common &s;en&s;e can di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>ju&s;|tice</HI> from <HI>inju&s;tice, right</HI> from <HI>wrong,

<NOTE N="(21)" PLACE="foot">(21) See my Tract on <Q><HI>the Law of Nature and the Principles of Action in Man,</HI></Q> wherein, I hope, this point is fully demon&s;trated.</NOTE> when|ever he happens to be an eye or ear witne&s;s of the proper circum&s;tances of evidence for &s;uch a judgement! <HI>Every man,</HI> (except as above,) be he ever &s;o poor and mean with re&s;pect to his rank in this life, inherits <HI>the knowledge of good and evil,</HI> or REASON, from the common parents of mankind, and is thereby rendered an&s;werable to GOD for <HI>all</HI> his actions, and an&s;werable to MAN for <HI>many</HI> of them!</P>
<P>In this <HI>hereditary knowledge,</HI> and in the proper u&s;e of it, (according to the different &s;tations of life in which men &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this world,) con&s;i&s;ts the <HI>equality</HI> of ALL MANKIND in the &s;ight of GOD, and al&s;o in the eye of <HI>the law,</HI> I mean the <HI>common law</HI> and rules of <HI>natural ju&s;|tice,</HI> which are formed upon the &s;elf|evident
<PB N="86" REF="85">conclu&s;ions of <HI>human rea&s;on,</HI> and are the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the above|mentioned <HI>hereditary knowledge in</HI> MAN. Every man <HI>knows,</HI> by what we call <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> (which is only an effect of <HI>human rea&s;on</HI> upon the mind,) whether his own actions de&s;erve the <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>magi&s;trate, who</HI> <Q><HI>bears not the &s;word in vain!</HI></Q> And the &s;ame prin|ciple of <HI>hereditary knowledge</HI> enables him to judge al&s;o concerning the out|ward actions of <HI>other men,</HI> whether they be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>unju&s;t;</HI> whether they be <HI>prai&s;e|worthy</HI> or <HI>cen&s;urable!</HI></P>
<P>But, if a man abu&s;es his own <HI>natural rea&s;on,</HI> and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be blinded by private intere&s;t, by pa&s;&s;ion, or un|rea&s;onable re&s;entment, or by pride, en|vy, or per&s;onal partiality, and is there|by led to mi&s;con&s;true the actions of his &s;uperiors, to behave un&s;eemly to|wards them, and to cen&s;ure them pub|licly
<PB N="87" REF="86">without a ju&s;t cau&s;e, the <HI>con&s;ci|ence</HI> of &s;uch an offender again&s;t <HI>rea|&s;on</HI> will &s;peedily inform him that he has cau&s;e to <HI>fear the magi&s;trate,</HI> and that he is liable to &s;uffer for his mi&s;be|haviour <HI>"as an evil doer:"</HI> but, when the like faults are di&s;coverable on the o|ther &s;ide, that is, on the &s;ide of the &s;uperior or magi&s;trate, (as it happened in the ca&s;e of Ananias,) a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> cen&s;ure of the <HI>unju&s;t</HI> magi&s;trate, even though it comes from the poore&s;t and meane&s;t man that happens to be pre&s;ent, will have its due weight in the opinion of all unprejudiced and di&s;intere&s;ted per|&s;ons, and may occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable check to the progre&s;s of <HI>inju&s;tice;</HI> and, therefore, if any man neglects &s;uch an opportunity (when he has it in his power) of making a per&s;onal <HI>prote&s;t</HI> (as Paul did) again&s;t the public inju&s;tice of a wicked magi&s;trate, he &s;trengthens the hand of iniquity by his timidity

<P>Shall we blame the patriotic apo&s;tle, then, for his zeal in vindicating <HI>the natu|ral rights of mankind</HI> again&s;t an UNJUST JUDGE, when he had &s;o fair an op|portunity of prote&s;ting again&s;t his ini|quity? God forbid!

Being an An&s;wer to an Opi|nion, given in the Year 1729, by the (then) Attor|ney General and Solicitor General, concerning the Ca&s;e of <HI>Slaves</HI> in GREAT-BRITAIN. 1769. <Q>This Tract contains many Examples of the mon&s;trous <HI>Iniquity</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> of the Plantation Laws re&s;pecting Slaves; as al&s;o &s;ome Account of the gradual Abolition of the ancient Engli&s;h <HI>Slavery</HI> called VILLENAGE, which was at length happily effected by the Wi&s;dom and Per&s;everance of the Engli&s;h Courts of Common Law.</Q></ITEM>

Remarks on the Opinions of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW, re&s;pecting the due Di&s;tinction between <HI>Man&s;laughter</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> &s;hewing that the Indulgence allowed by the Courts to <HI>voluntary Man&s;laughter</HI> in Rencounters, DUELS, &amp;c. is <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> and without Foundation in Law; and is al&s;o one of the principal Cau&s;es of the Conti|nuance and pre&s;ent Increa&s;e of the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> and <HI>di&s;grace|ful</HI> Practice of DUELLING. 1773. <Q>The peculiar Ca&s;e of <HI>Gentlemen in the Army,</HI> re&s;pecting the Practice of DUELLING, is carefully examined in this Tract; as al&s;o the Depravity and Folly of <HI>modern Men of Honour</HI> fal&s;ely &s;o called.</Q></ITEM>

A Declaration, or Defence, of the <HI>the &s;ame Doctrine,</HI> when applied <HI>particularly to</HI> THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND. 1774.

Examples are likewi&s;e here given of &s;everal <HI>&s;urreptitious</HI> STATUTES that are void through the Want of <HI>due legal A&s;&s;ent;</HI> and of Others that are <HI>void</HI> by being
