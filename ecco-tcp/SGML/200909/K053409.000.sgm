<HEAD>A TRACT ON THE LAW OF NATURE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE neither lei&s;ure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> with all the doctrines u&s;ually ranked under that head: and indeed, if I had both lei&s;ure and abili|ties, I &s;hould want inclination; becau&s;e &s;uch a work would unavoidably become voluminous, on account of the variety of authors nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned, who have treated the &s;ubject with dif|ferent views: and as all &s;cience is vain, which is not reduced to practice, &s;o the more voluminous any &s;ubject is ren|dered,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the le&s;s it can be u&s;eful, on ac|count of the increa&s;ed difficulty of com|municating it to the generality of read|ers. I have therefore confined my tract to &s;uch <HI>general</HI> remarks on the &s;ubject, as are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the ob&s;ervation of my countrymen at large, with re&s;pect (more particularly) to one point, viz. <HI>the Illegality</HI> of reducing or &s;ubjecting man|kind to <HI>involuntary &s;ervitude,</HI> either under political or private dominion: as all pre|ten&s;ions to an <HI>unlimited authority</HI> of any man or men over others, are con|trary to <HI>Natural Equity</HI> and the <HI>Laws of God,</HI> as well as baneful to mankind in general; which effect is unhappily de|mon&s;trated by the numberle&s;s in&s;tances of <HI>unnatural</HI> oppre&s;&s;ion now prevailing to the de&s;truction of mankind, in almo&s;t every part of the world. I have already &s;hewn in my an&s;wer <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>This an&s;wer to Mr. Thomp&s;on is confined to one kind of &s;lavery only, viz. <HI>the oppre&s;&s;ion of private tyrants,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5">or petty &s;laveholders, and has already been printed <HI>in America;</HI> and therefore I need not now repeat the argu|ments which it contains, e&s;pecially as I propo&s;e &s;oon to re|print it in England with &s;ome other tracts expre&s;sly again&s;t <HI>dome&s;tick &s;lavery,</HI> &s;uch as is <HI>unlawfully tolerated</HI> in the Briti&s;h colonies.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"></NOTE> to the Reverend
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Mr. Thomp&s;on (an advocate for the African &s;lave trade) that the Jewi&s;h con|&s;titutions were not &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent <HI>with the Law of Nature in all points;</HI> and, con&s;equently, that they are not to be con&s;idered as the rule by which law|yers and ca&s;ui&s;ts may &s;afely determine <HI>"what is, or what is not, according to Nature."</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Law of Nature</HI> has been variou&s;ly repre&s;ented; but all the be&s;t writers, both ancient and modern, agree in adopt|ing that maxim of the Civil In&s;ti|tutes <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Servitus</HI> autem e&s;t con&s;titutio Juris Gentium qua quis dominio alieno <HI>contra naturam</HI> &s;ubjicitur." Ju&s;tin. In&s;titutes, Book 1. Tit. 3.</P>
<P>From whence the other authorities in the <HI>Common Law</HI> of England &s;eem to be derived.</P>

<P>"<HI>Servitude</HI> is a con&s;titution of the Law of Nations, by which, <HI>contrary to Nature,</HI> one is &s;ubjected to another's power."

<PB N="4" REF="6">
or <HI>&s;lavery, to be "contrary to the Law of Nature:"</HI> this rule is commonly under&s;tood as applicable only to <HI>dome&s;tic &s;lavery;</HI> but it is equally true when ap|plied to <HI>political oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> or the exer|ci&s;e of an <HI>unlimited dominion</HI> over a whole nation. Some few authors indeed have been &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to a&s;&s;ert that <HI>"there is no &s;uch thing as natural Law;"</HI> but they are properly cen&s;ured by the learned Baron Puffendorf, in his "Law of Nature and Nations." Book 2. Chap. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">He particularly mentions the argu|ment of Carniades as contracted by Lac|tantius to the following effect.</P>
<P>"That men fir&s;t in&s;tituted Laws to &s;ecure and promote their own advantage, &amp;c. but that there was no &s;uch thing as <HI>Natural Law</HI> in the world," &amp;c. p. 104.</P>
<P>Such doctrine is certainly very con|venient for Tyrants and Slaveholders of every degree, who mu&s;t otherwi&s;e re|main without excu&s;e, whenever <HI>"the Law of Nature,"</HI> and <HI>"the Common Rights of Humanity,"</HI> are urged again&s;t them: it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for them, either to mi&s;repre&s;ent <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> (as the Reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on has done), or el&s;e (like Carniades) utterly to deny its exi&s;tence. This latter method has been al&s;o adopted by &s;ome modern advocates for <HI>Slavery,</HI> who, in private di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, have declared, that they e&s;teem <HI>"the Law of Nature"</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to be no other than their <HI>natural</HI> pro|pen&s;ity to pur&s;ue their own heart's de&s;ire of profit or plea&s;ure: and this they call <HI>"natural Liberty;"</HI> though it certainly is the mo&s;t <HI>unnatural Tyranny:</HI> for when the immutable nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>reciprocal con|&s;ideration</HI> is forgot, or &s;et a&s;ide, there can be no &s;afety among men, and con|&s;equently no <HI>natural Liberty:</HI> we mu&s;t, therefore, &s;ubmit our&s;elves to be <HI>the &s;er|vants of law,</HI> in order to be truly <HI>free;</HI> according to the excellent ob&s;ervation of Cicero. "Legum denique idcirco om|nes <HI>Servi</HI> &s;umus, ut <HI>liberi</HI> e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;umus." Tom. 2. p. 208. <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Hamburgh Edition 1618.</NOTE>. We may learn from the hi&s;tories of all nations, that Lu&s;t, Ava|rice, Pride, Revenge, Love of Power, Jea|lou&s;y, &amp;c. are <HI>Principles of Action,</HI> which unavoidably produce <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>wrongs,</HI> to the de&s;truction of the human &s;pecies, in all places where <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> (whether in political or private domi|nion)
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<HI>are &s;upreme;</HI> or whenever <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Private Intere&s;t</HI> become entirely predominant among men. That <HI>Self-love</HI> is predominant with the <HI>generality of mankind</HI> is but too apparent; yet we are not, therefore, obliged to admit that <HI>"Self-love" is "the univer&s;al principle of action;"</HI> though an eminent and learn|ed <HI>law-writer</HI> has (with very good in|tentions, as his argument proves) thought proper to give it that title.</P>
<P><HI>"Hone&s;ty</HI> (indeed) <HI>is the be&s;t policy,"</HI> even for a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h man</HI> to pur&s;ue; and, it is certain, that the &s;olid attainments of virtue and ju&s;tice afford a real and &s;ub|&s;tantial &s;atisfaction, which in the end, mo&s;t amply fulfils the purpo&s;es of <HI>Self-love.</HI></P>
<P>But though <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> are thus favourable to <HI>Self-love</HI> in their <HI>natural effects,</HI> yet this, by no means, proves that
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<HI>Self-love</HI> is the <HI>motive</HI> of all <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> men; or that it is the <HI>"univer&s;al principle of action:"</HI> for, if that were really the ca&s;e, many of the mo&s;t amiable virtues mu&s;t be e&s;teemed mere empty names. There could be no true Gene|ro&s;ity or Benevolence; no Di&s;intere&s;ted Goodne&s;s of heart; no &s;incere <HI>Natural Affection</HI> between parents and their chil|dren, hu&s;bands and their wives, brethren, friends, &amp;c. whereas hi&s;tory affords many undoubted in&s;tances of <HI>Self-love</HI> being lo&s;t in <HI>the &s;uperior affections, natural to generous minds,</HI> in all the&s;e different de|grees of connection; but it is needle&s;s to recite them, &s;ince, even in the brute creation there are <HI>natural</HI> <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P>That excellent Engli&s;h lawyer the Great Henry de Bracton informs us, that <HI>"Natural Law</HI> is that which <HI>Nature</HI> (or more properly God him&s;elf) has <HI>taught all animals."</HI> "Jus <HI>Naturale</HI> e&s;t quod <HI>Natura,</HI> i. e. ip&s;e Deus, docuit

<PB N="14" REF="16">
obtaining a true practical idea of the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Principles of Action in Man.</HI></P>
<P>God delivered a clear and expre&s;s Law to <HI>Man</HI> before the fall;&mdash;<Q>but of the tree of <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou &s;halt not eat of it:</HI></Q> and then fol|lows the denunciation of puni&s;hment;&mdash;<Q>for <HI>in the day</HI> that thou eate&s;t thereof, <HI>thou &s;halt &s;urely</HI> DIE. <BIBL>Gen. ii. 17.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>fir&s;t and only penal Law;</HI> A FORFEITURE OF LIFE! And though we find afterwards, that the declared puni&s;hment was not immediately exe|cuted according to the letter (that is, the penalty of <HI>death</HI> was not inflicted on <HI>the day</HI> of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as it &s;eemed to be at fir&s;t ordained) yet this affords no ju&s;t exception again&s;t the truth and pro|priety of the relation.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">The &s;ame ALMIGHTY BEING, who had <HI>a right</HI> (as all things are his own) to prohibit the action above-mentioned, and to a&s;&s;ign a puni&s;hment for di&s;obe|dience, had certainly <HI>a right</HI> al&s;o to re|&s;pite, or po&s;tpone, or even to remit (if he had been plea&s;ed to do &s;o) the exe|cution of <HI>the Law</HI> which he him&s;elf had ordained. But for the pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to remark, that the <HI>nature of the penalty</HI> had been clearly revealed to our fir&s;t parents, and was as clearly un|der&s;tood by them, &s;o that they were &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of their obligation to ob&s;erve the &s;aid <HI>Law,</HI> previous to their breach of it: which plainly appears by the &s;peech of the woman to the tempter, viz. <Q>But of the fruit of the tree in the mid&s;t of the garden, GOD <HI>hath &s;aid,</HI> ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it, <HI>le&s;t ye die.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">After &s;o clear an acknowledgment of the <HI>divine</HI> precept, the act of taking the fruit (which otherwi&s;e in it&s;elf would, probably, have been no crime) was cer|tainly a <HI>wilful &s;in</HI> of a very heinous na|ture, being a <HI>gro&s;s contempt of God's word,</HI> for which our fir&s;t parents very ju&s;tly incurred the <HI>penalty of death,</HI> which, they were previou&s;ly told, mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>They had received this caution even <HI>from God him&s;elf,</HI> whom they knew to be their Maker and Supreme Lord; and yet the unwary woman unhappily li&s;tened to an a&s;&s;ertion, that was ab&s;olutely contra|dictory to her <HI>Creator's word,</HI> and there|by drew upon her&s;elf, and all her de|&s;cendants, the irrevocable doom to <HI>la|bour!&mdash;pain!</HI>&mdash;and <HI>mortality!</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the haughty philo&s;opher will now be ready to arraign the ju&s;tice of
<PB N="17" REF="19">
the divine decree, which involved the innocent progeny (that is, innocent with re&s;pect to this particular crime) in the puni&s;hment of their <HI>guilty parents;</HI> but if he will patiently follow me through this examination of <HI>Human Na|ture,</HI> he will, perhaps, be able to form a better idea of the <HI>Nature of original Sin,</HI> and of the cau&s;e of its being in|tailed (or rather <HI>the effects</HI> of its being <HI>intailed</HI>) on all the de&s;cendants of Adam. For the immediate <HI>effect</HI> of that <HI>original Sin</HI> of our fir&s;t parents, was the acqui|&s;ition of <HI>an additional faculty</HI> (even of a divine attribute) to the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> which of cour&s;e de&s;cends from the&s;e original &s;tocks by <HI>natural inheritance</HI> to all their progeny, and thereby inevitably <HI>involves them all</HI> in the &s;ame condem|nation; the manner of which &s;hall be more particularly explained hereafter. This very ancient example of puni&s;h|ment for a <HI>contempt of God's word</HI> (the
<PB N="18" REF="20">
direful effects of which, <HI>labour, pain,</HI> and <HI>mortality,</HI> are ever before us) &s;hould teach mankind the extreme danger of paying attention to any doctrines and interpretations of Law or Religion, that have the lea&s;t tendency to oppo&s;e or con|tradict the literal or mo&s;t obvious mean|ing of God's word; for the efforts of our <HI>&s;piritual Enemy</HI> are never more bane|ful, than when he is plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume the office of a commentator on the Laws of God; in which character he is fre|quently di&s;coverable; for though he does not now pre&s;ent him&s;elf <HI>outwardly</HI> or <HI>ap|parently,</HI> as at fir&s;t, in the a&s;&s;umed &s;hape of a &s;erpent, yet the venom of his doctrines is too often &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hable, both in the writings and di&s;cour&s;es of men! And it is remarkable, that his fir&s;t attempt again&s;t mankind &s;hould be in the capacity of a <HI>critick</HI> on the <HI>Divine Law!</HI> The influence of <HI>&s;piritual enemies</HI> is indeed a di&s;tinct <HI>Principle of Action in
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Man,</HI> which &s;hall be more particularly mentioned in the cour&s;e of this Tract.</P>

<P>The learned author has him&s;elf a&s;|&s;igned a more probable foundation in the preceding page, to which perhaps he might mean to refer by the prono|minal adjective <HI>"This,"</HI> in the &s;entence which immediately follows his <Q>one paternal Precept,</Q> (viz. <Q><HI>This</HI> is the foundation of what we call Ethics, or natural Law</Q>) for he ob&s;erves in p. 40. that, <Q>CONSIDERING the Creator only as a Being of infinite <HI>Power,</HI> he was able unque&s;tionably to have pre|&s;cribed whatever Laws he plea&s;ed to his creature Man, however unju&s;t or &s;evere.

<P>And, thirdly, Becau&s;e <HI>bad</HI> actions, which mo&s;t abound, manife&s;tly tend, even in the opinion of the offenders them&s;elves, to defeat the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es of <HI>Self-love;</HI> for the mo&s;t hard|ened

<P><HI>Self-love,</HI> however, under proper re|&s;trictions, is certainly a main branch of <HI>the Law of Nature;</HI> and, though it can|not be admitted as the <Q>univer&s;al Prin|ciple of Action,</Q> is neverthele&s;s an <HI>uni|ver&s;al Principle;</HI> but it cannot be ad|mitted as a <HI>"Rule of Obedience,"</HI> becau&s;e there are many occa&s;ions when it ought to be &s;uper&s;eded by more noble Motives to <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI> is al&s;o an <HI>univer&s;al Principle in Man;</HI> though it is &s;till much farther from being <Q>the

<P>Nothing is &s;o liable to be mi&s;under|&s;tood as <HI>"our own Happine&s;s;"</HI> for when <HI>Self</HI> alone is the object, <HI>Self-love</HI> can imply nothing but <HI>Partiality</HI> and <HI>Self-preference;</HI> &s;o that &s;uch <Q>a Rule of Obe|dience</Q>
<PB N="66" REF="68">
is liable to afford a handle of excu&s;e for actions of mere <HI>Self-gratifica|tion,</HI> to which the learned and worthy author (or, perhaps, rather the adopter) of the hypothe&s;is would be entirely aver&s;e: a <HI>Slaveholder,</HI> for in&s;tance, might al|ledge, that he <Q>pur&s;ues his own Hap|pine&s;s,</Q> by extorting the unwilling &s;ervice of other men, becau&s;e he is thereby enabled to maintain him&s;elf and family, not only comfortably, but ele|gantly; and that the maintenance and &s;upport of the &s;ugar i&s;lands, and con&s;e|quently the happine&s;s of his wealthy neighbours, depends upon the employ|ing of &s;laves; &s;o that <HI>&s;ocial benefits</HI> do al&s;o ari&s;e from it: and he will likewi&s;e alledge, that he is obliged by <Q>Self-love</Q> to per&s;i&s;t in the mea&s;ure, be|cau&s;e he cannot maintain the &s;ame <HI>Hap|pine&s;s</HI> and comfort by any other means; &s;o that he does not act contrary to <Q>the Law of Nature, <HI>or the</HI> "Rule of

Obedience,"</Q> as laid down by the mo&s;t eminent writers on the &s;ubject!</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> (as it is called) of pur&s;uing our own <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> may lead men to form a fal&s;e e&s;timate of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> (or what they may think them|&s;elves <HI>obliged to undertake,</HI> from their particular &s;ituation in life) and will afford them the like excu&s;e for any other vice, on which a man's temporal &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence depends.</P>
<P>It is therefore an <HI>oblique Rule,</HI> which in&s;en&s;ibly declines into mere <HI>Self-grati|fication,</HI> or private Intere&s;t, which is the bane of Equity and Ju&s;tice; &s;o that <HI>Self-love</HI> can no otherwi&s;e be admitted <HI>as a Rule,</HI> than for the purpo&s;e of mea&s;uring the due proportion of <HI>that Love which we owe to the re&s;t of Mankind,</HI> agreeable to a real <HI>"paternal Precept"</HI> that will

&s;ome <HI>Evil</HI> Affections, and &s;ometimes of mere bodily Di&s;orders <NOTE N="(43)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>According to them</Q> (&s;aid Archbp.

This is the doctrine of Mr. Hobbs, and his followers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But there cannot a vainer conceit enter into a man's head than this is. By the very &s;ame logic that they can prove this, they may likewi&s;e prove, that all tho&s;e men that are &s;poken of in the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment, were not real per&s;ons, but qualities. For it is certain, that the Devil is in the Scripture as much repre&s;ented as a per&s;on, a real &s;ub&s;i&s;ting being, di&s;tinct from God and from good angels, and from mankind; I &s;ay, he is as plainly thus repre&s;ented, as any man or woman, that is there mentioned, is. And he, for in|&s;tance, that will &s;ay, that when our Saviour was tempted by the Devil in the wilderne&s;s, all this was but a tran|&s;action of his imagination, and that it was only his own fancy that pre&s;ented to his eyes all the kingdoms of the world, and that it was only his own fancy that &s;et him upon a pinacle of the temple, and would have had him fallen down and wor&s;hipped it; I &s;ay, he that would give &s;uch an account as this, of that matter, may with the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;ay, that Je&s;us him&s;elf was but a phanta&s;m, an imagination, and that there was never &s;uch a real per&s;on in the world.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"><Q>The Devil then has a real Being of his own, inde|pendent of us, or any other creature: and that Being is of the <HI>&s;piritual or angelic nature.</HI> As there are good &s;pirits, and good angels, &s;o there are evil &s;pirits, and evil angels; and of this latter &s;ort is the the Devil.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But then, &s;econdly, When we are &s;peaking of the Devil, we are not to under&s;tand any one particular being, or any one particular evil &s;pirit, but the whole aggregate, or company of evil &s;pirits, which inhabit round about us in the lower regions of the air. All the&s;e are in the &s;cripture language, and in common &s;peech, called by the name of the Devil, and &s;ome|times in the plural number, by the name of Devils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For the under&s;tanding this we are to know, that among that infinite and innumerable company of angels which God created in a happy and glorious condition, all of them did not continue in that primitive happi|ne&s;s: but &s;everal of them, by their wilful apo&s;ta&s;y from God, forfeited that dignity and glory they were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and &s;o depraved their natures, that they were incapable of dwelling any longer where they did before: but were, by the ju&s;t vengeance of God, ca&s;t down into the&s;e lower regions of the air, where they are re&s;erved by Providence, to the judgment and pu|ni&s;hment of the great day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is the plain account that the Scriptures give us as to this matter. Thus St. Jude in the 6th ver&s;e of 
<PB N="125" REF="127">his Epi&s;tle: <HI>The angels,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitations, them hath God re|&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judg|ment of the great day.</HI> And ju&s;t to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame words, doth St. Peter &s;peak in the &s;econd chapter of his &s;econd Epi&s;tle, ver&s;e the fourth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e fallen angels now thus thru&s;t down from heaven, tho' they do yet in a great mea&s;ure retain all the intellectual accompli&s;hments of the angelical na|ture, &s;uch as rea&s;on, and memory, and knowledge, yet are they in their moral qualities quite contrary to all the good angels; and particularly as to this, that as the good angels are infinitely kind and benign, great lovers of God and of mankind, and mo&s;t intirely di&s;|po&s;ed to do all good offices to them what&s;oever; &s;o the nature of tho&s;e fallen angels is cruel and revengeful, full of hatred, and &s;pite, and malice to God, and to his whole creation; and upon account of this, the Scripture hath given to them the name of Satan or Devil, which two words (as all that under&s;tand the learned languages know) &s;ignify neither more nor le&s;s than an adver&s;ary, or an accu&s;er, or calumniator. The one being the Hebrew word for it, and the other the Greek word. And indeed it is, with reference to this enmity to mankind, that mo&s;t of the&s;e names and cha|racters, that they bear in Scripture, are be&s;towed upon them. Upon this account it is, that the Devil is called a murderer, a deceiver, a lyar, and the father of lyes,
<PB N="126" REF="128">the de&s;troyer, the old &s;erpent, the great dragon, with &s;undry other &s;uch appellations. But then, tho' the&s;e names being put in the &s;ingular number, &s;eem to denote &s;ome &s;ingle evil &s;pirit, that bears ill-will to mankind; yet we are always to remember, that they are to be expounded collectively, that is to &s;ay, to &s;ignify the whole body of the&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits, of which there are a va&s;t number: I &s;ay, the whole body of them; for that the&s;e lap&s;ed angels are formed into a body politic, or government, or kingdom, is plainly enough inti|mated in the New Te&s;tament: for there we meet with the kingdom of darkne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to the kingdom of light; and there we meet with the prince of the Devils as the chief of them; who is likewi&s;e by St. Paul called, <HI>The god of this world, and the prince of the power of the air.</HI> Under whom al&s;o, as in other &s;ocieties, there are many &s;ubordinate officers, as St. Paul &s;eems to intimate in the 6th of the Ephe&s;ians; where, among the wicked &s;pirits in heavenly places (that is, in the air, as Grotius, with the ancients, rightly expounds it) that he &s;aith we wre&s;tle again&s;t, he makes mention in the plural number of principalities and powers, and other rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is the Scripture account of the&s;e matters.

Whether this general conflagration will happen upon Chri&s;t's coming to judgment, or rather will be the la&s;t tran&s;action of the judgment, the Scripture doth not declare. But that there &s;hall be &s;uch a conflagration, and that THIS FIRE SHALL BE FOR THE EVER|LASTING PUNISHMENT BOTH OF THE DEVIL AND WICKED MEN, WHO WILL ALL BE TUMBLED
<PB N="143" REF="145">DOWN INTO THESE LOWER REGIONS, WHICH WILL THEN BE A PERFECT LAKE OR SEA OF FIRE (as the Scripture expre&s;&s;eth it, Rev. xix. 20.) is beyond all doubt. To this purpo&s;e let us ob&s;erve what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance of them that know not God, and obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. i. 7.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But more expre&s;ly this conflagration of the world is taught us in the &s;econd Epi&s;tle of St. Peter, Chap. iii. 6, 7. where the Apo&s;tle tells us, that <HI>as the world which was of old peri&s;hed</HI> by an univer&s;al deluge of <HI>water, &s;o the heavens and the earth which are now, are kept in &s;tore, re&s;erved unto fire again&s;t the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</HI> From whence it is plain, that at the day of judgment this world &s;hall be &s;et on fire, and that fire &s;hall be for the puni&s;hment of un|godly men. Furthermore, in the ver&s;es following, he adds to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>The day of the Lord &s;hall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up,</HI> ver. 10.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If any one be at a lo&s;s to conceive how the heavens &s;hould be &s;et on fire as well as the earth, as St. Peter three times in this chapter affirms they &s;hall be; the difficulty will be removed by con&s;idering that the hea|vens here &s;poken of, are not tho&s;e heavens in which 
<PB N="144" REF="146">&s;tars are, (in which &s;ignification we commonly u&s;e that word) but the &s;ublunary heavens, viz. tho&s;e lower re|gions of the air, wherein are the clouds and vapours and other meteors, which are here called the elements, and in which &s;en&s;e the heavens are frequently taken in holy Scripture. Now the&s;e heavens, together with all that is in them, &s;hall at that day pa&s;s away with a crackling noi&s;e of fire, and the earth, and all the things in it, &s;hall be put in flames. David tells us, that <HI>upon the wicked God &s;hall rain fire and brim&s;tone, and an hor|rible tempe&s;t; this &s;hall be the portion of their cup,</HI> P&s;alm xi. 6. And our Saviour intimates the &s;ame, when he tells us, as <HI>in the day when Lot went out of Sodom, it it rained fire and brim&s;tone from heaven, and de&s;troyed them all; &s;o &s;hall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed,</HI> Luke xvii. 29, 30.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And now who can expre&s;s the horror and confu&s;ion that &s;hall be at that day? Who can fancy &s;o &s;ad and di&s;mal a face of things, as &s;hall then be all the world over?
