<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>_SEVERAL Pamphlets having from Time to Time been publi&s;hed
concerning the RO|BINHOOD SOCIETY, &s;ome in Vindication of it, and others
again&s;t it, the public At|tention has been awakened; and many have de&s;ired
to know the <PB N="vi" REF="4"> Origin of this Society, and to be acquainted
with its Proceed|ings, from it fir&s;t Formation to its pre&s;ent State. But no
Work hitherto printed, has related the&s;e Particulars. Indeed, they have all
been &s;o remarkably &s;ilent on the&s;e Heads, that, like the brave
<HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> who, born of a com|mon Pro&s;titute, and unable to learn
who was his real Father, concluded he had none at all, many People imagine,
either that this Society had no Origin, or that it is &s;o ob&s;cure and
uncer|tain, that no Traces of it can now be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>BUT this is a Mi&s;take. A true and impartial Review of the&s;e 
<PB N="vii" REF="5"> Particulars may be expected in the&s;e Memoirs; and it is
not doubted, but it will amply gratify the Curio&s;ity of the Reader. If he
de&s;ires to know from whence the&s;e Materials have been drawn, I &s;hall
inform him, that they were from Manu&s;cripts of my Grandfather and Father; the
for|mer of whom was not only a Member, but the Promoter of 
<Q REND="inline">"THE SOCIETIE FOR FREE AND CANDYD ENQUIRIE,"</Q>
for &s;o were they at fir&s;t called; and in|deed, they have retained the Title
ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>AS to the Hi&s;tory of the Mem|bers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, for
1764, that, indeed, is intirely <PB N="viii" REF="6"> my own Work. I have been
obli|ged to no one for Anecdotes, but to the Members them&s;elves; and I have,
with no &s;mall Pains and Indu&s;try, as well as Time and Expence, collected
from them &s;uch Accounts as the Reader will here meet with. Indeed, in a Work
of this Nature, &s;ome Anec|dotes, not founded on Facts, mu&s;t be expected;
Anecdotes invented by the Envy or Vanity of the Relater. But it is hoped, the
Number of the&s;e is but few: For the Author, or rather Compiler, has, when he
&s;u&s;pected the Truth of any Relation, not contented him&s;elf with having
&s;omething new to &s;ay, as too many of our Biographers and Hi&s;tory-Writers 
<PB N="ix" REF="7"> do; but has made the mo&s;t dili|gent Enquiries of
different People, to whom the &s;everal Members were intimately known, and
&s;ome as School-fellows; and from them he has learnt their real
<HI>Parentage</HI> and <HI>Education, Life, Character</HI> and
<HI>Behaviour:</HI> So that, in gene|ral, the&s;e Memoirs may be deem|ed as
authentic and genuine, as, perhaps, any that have been ever given to the World,
though they may not be &s;o gaudily dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Speeches I have given on different Subjects, as Specimens of
the Members Abilities, are, in the &s;trict Sen&s;e of the Word,
<HI>Original;</HI> for they were taken <PB N="x" REF="8"> down in Short-Hand,
at the very Time they were &s;poken.</P>
<P>THE Reader may now di&s;cern what he has to expect in this Work.
And, without the Im|putation of Vanity, I think I may affirm, that the Public
will be both in&s;tructed and entertained in the Peru&s;al of it. The ROBINHOOD
SOCIETY has, of late, greatly at|tracted the Notice of the World; and is now
&s;o much frequented, that, almo&s;t every <HI>Monday</HI> Night, Numbers are
robbed of the En|tertainment they expect, becau&s;e it is &s;o crowded, that no
more can be admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="9"> TO tho&s;e who have often at|tended the
Society, and are ac|quainted with the Nature of it, the Author of the&s;e
Memoirs ap|peals for a Character of Candour and Impartiality; and he is
confi|dent they will allow, that his De|&s;cription of the Debates is true and
faithful, his Portraits of the Members ju&s;t and &s;triking, and the Speeches
he has &s;elected au|thentic and <HI>original.</HI></P>
<P>HE will only add farther con|cerning this Work, that he be|lieves
no other MSS. but tho&s;e he has in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, containing the
Origin of the Society and its Proceedings, till it was re|moved 
<PB N="xii" REF="10"> to the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> are now extant.</P>
<P>AS then no other Per&s;on is able to trace the Original of the
Soci|ety, and relate its Progre&s;s for no le&s;s a Term than 151 Years, (for
&s;o long it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted) he doubts not but his <HI>complete
Hi&s;tory</HI> will favourably be received.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Robinhood Society.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have been cha|racteri&s;ed by many
ingenious Foreigners, as a People that delight greatly in Clubs and
A&s;&s;emblies; which they im|pute to a &s;ocial and good-natured
Di&s;po|&s;ition, and to a Love of Science. It is owing to this
Di&s;po&s;ition, and to this af|fection for Knowledge, that there is &s;carce a
Town or Village in our Kingdom, but <PB N="2" REF="12"> what has its Clubs, or
Places of nocturnal Entertainment; where, after the Fatigues of the Day, Men of
various Occupations in Life, meet to di&s;&s;ipate the Gloom which has been
&s;pread by Study, or any inten&s;e Application; and, by a mutual
Commu|nication of Sentiment, either in Fla&s;hes of Wit, or &s;olid Argument,
to improve their Judgments, and entertain their Imagi|nations.</P>
<P>SUCH is the favourable Point of View in which judicious Foreigners
behold our natural Propen&s;ity of forming and fre|quenting Clubs; and &s;uch
their De&s;cription of the good Effects re&s;ulting from them.</P>
<P>BUT, I am afraid, that though &s;ome Clubs produce the&s;e
Effects, the Genera|rality of them produce the Rever&s;e; and may be deemed
Receptacles for the Idle and the Di&s;&s;olute, where Mode&s;ty is thrown
a&s;ide, like their Great Coats, and where Impiety, Ob&s;cenity, and
Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s prevail to the greate&s;t Degree; where a Love of
Lazine&s;s, and an Aver&s;ion to hone&s;t Indu&s;try are contracted; where the
keeping ill Hours is encouraged, to the great Detriment of Individuals, and to
the Prejudice of the Community; and <PB N="3" REF="13"> where, in &s;hort, no
u&s;eful Subject em|ploys their Thoughts or Tongues, but mere Noi&s;e and
Non&s;en&s;e, ob&s;cene Songs or Tales, and large Draughts of Liquor, form
their Savage Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, however true this De&s;cription may be of Clubs in general,
it cannot be &s;aid, that the particular Kind of Club, re|&s;embling that of
the ROBINHOOD, is of their Nature, or produces their Effects: Tho&s;e are
<HI>Drinking Clubs;</HI> this is a <HI>Di&s;|puting</HI> one. At tho&s;e
Places, Men meet to feed their Bodies; at this, they a&s;&s;emble to feed their
Minds. At tho&s;e, Intoxi|cation is very frequent; at this, very rare. I could
heighten the Contra&s;t, but it is needle&s;s. The Peru&s;al of the&s;e Sheets
will &s;ufficiently acquaint the Reader with the Nature and Tendency of the
ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, and of Di&s;puting Clubs in general; and therefore, without
&s;triving to bia&s;s his Judgment, or preclude his Re|marks by any of my own,
I &s;hall proceed to my Account of 
<Q REND="inline">"THE SOCIETY FOR FREE AND CANDID ENQUIRY",</Q>
from its infant State, to its pre&s;ent mature Growth, at the ROBINHOOD and
LITTLE JOHN, in <HI>Butcher-Row.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14"> IN the Year 1613, when that fine Piece of
Work, equally honourable and u&s;eful, the <HI>New River</HI> was completed,
Sir HUGH MYDDLETON, who had a great Affection and Regard for my Grand-father,
WIL|LIAM G********, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> being in Com|pany with him one Day,
lamented it as a great Infelicity, and a va&s;t Ob&s;truction of human
Knowledge, that light and trivial Subjects alone generally found Admittance
into polite Companies, while important and weighty ones were excluded. My
Grand-father acquie&s;ced with him in Sen|timents, and propo&s;ed it as his
Opinion, that a Society might be formed to con&s;i&s;t of a certain Number of
Gentlemen, of li|beral Education and acquired Accompli&s;h|ments, to meet
Weekly, at &s;ome conve|nient Room, to di&s;cour&s;e on Subjects that would
contribute to their mutual In&s;truc|tion and Entertainment. Sir HUGH de|clared
it was a lucky Sugge&s;tion, and he would think of it at Lei&s;ure, and let him
know his Opinion of the Practicability of putting &s;uch a Scheme into
Execution the next Time he &s;aw him.</P>
<P>THE Intimacy that had, for many Years, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Sir
HUGH and my Grand|father, <PB N="5" REF="15"> would not permit their being
ab|&s;ent for any con&s;iderable Time after this Meeting, and the Starting of a
Subject which had &s;uch Charms for both. My Grand-father was a good Speaker,
and no bad Writer. In the juvenile Part of his Life, he had been engaged in
mercantile Bu&s;ine&s;s in a very exten&s;ive Manner; and conducting his
Affairs with Skill and Pru|dence for about &s;even-and-twenty Years, he had
ama&s;&s;ed no le&s;s a Sum than forty-&s;even thou&s;and Pounds; with which,
con|trary to a great Number of Merchants, being contented, he retired from
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and lived on the Intere&s;t of his Fortune. As to Sir HUGH, he
was a Man of ex|treme good natural Parts, heightened and embelli&s;hed by the
Acqui&s;ition of the u&s;e|ful and ornamental Parts of Learning; and having, at
the Expence of the greate&s;t Part of an opulent Fortune, completed his darling
Project of bringing Water from <HI>Ware,</HI> through various Turnings and
Windings, to <HI>London,</HI> thereby &s;upplying that great Metropolis with
one of the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, he had now Lei&s;ure to
con&s;ider of other Employ|ments, and partake of other Amu&s;ements, not le&s;s
&s;uited to his Ta&s;te, and for which he was not le&s;s qualified. At the
Meet|ing <PB N="6" REF="16"> my Grand-father and Sir HUGH had at the olde&s;t
Tavern in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Lon|don Stone,</HI> in
<HI>Cannon-Street,</HI> over a Bottle of &s;ound Red Port, and, while
&s;moaking a Pipe of the new-found Plant, Tobacco, (which had been introduced
into <HI>England</HI> by Sir WALTER RALEIGH, but about twenty-five Years
before) they di&s;cour&s;ed at large of the Advantages that might be reaped
from a Society of judicious Per&s;ons, meet|ing once a Week to debate on
Subjects of Importance. For an Account of the In|&s;titution and Nature of the
Society, I am indebted to a Folio Book, which I have now in my Cu&s;tody, in my
Grand-father's own Hand-writing, and from which I have tran&s;cribed the
following Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<Q>IT was here (&s;ays the good old Man) that wee fully
di&s;cour&s;ed of the Affaire. Sir HUGH declared the Number of Per|&s;ons that
were to compo&s;e our Societie ought to be limitted, and that they &s;houlde
not exceede twentie; and in fine, wee both agreed in this Point, that wee
woulde forthwith looke out and &s;earch for proper Per&s;ons to be|longe to the
Societie, and who&s;e Names wee woulde enter into a little Booke: And after
that we had gained our pro|po&s;ed <PB N="7" REF="17"> Number of Per&s;ons,
which wee al&s;oe agreed &s;houlde be noe more than twentie, nor le&s;s than
twelve, wee would a&s;&s;embel oure&s;elves once in a Week, at a Hou&s;e of one
of the So|cietie, and the next Week, at the Hou&s;e of another, and &s;o on
'till wee had been at each other's Hou&s;e. After wee had &s;poken of the&s;e
Things, and fully agreed thereon, as I have here amply related, wee parted; Sir
HUGH going to a Countrie Hou&s;e he had late|lie rented at <HI>Mile-end,</HI>
and I going to mine in <HI>Norfolk-Street.</HI></Q>
<Q>ABOUT one Moneth after this, wee had gotten the Number of fifteen
Per|&s;ons, all of whome were Men of good|lie Parts and di&s;creete and worthie
Conduct; and at the Intreatie of my verie good Friende Sir HUGH, wee met all of
us at the <HI>London-Stone,</HI> of a <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI> Night, to write
downe our Names in a Booke, and to abide by, and agree to, a few Articles,
which were drawne up by Sir HUGH, which conteined all the Rules that wee would
be &s;ubject to, and which I think meet here to &s;et down.</Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="18"> LET not the Reader think me too
cir|cum&s;tantial for giving him the Articles which this Society of
Di&s;putants drew up and &s;igned: Any Thing relative to the In&s;titution of a
Society which has &s;ince that Time made &s;uch Noi&s;e in the World, cannot be
unintere&s;ting; on the contrary, it may afford greater Plea&s;ure to a curious
Per&s;on, than the Peru&s;al of the trifling Anecdotes that the mo&s;t eminent
Hi&s;tory-Writers often &s;well their Works with, or even than many Papers that
are obtruded on the World by a certain Society, who yet deem them&s;elves great

<P><PB N="13" REF="23">THE fir&s;t Meeting which this Society of
Gentlemen had, was the <HI>Monday</HI> &s;ub&s;e|quent to the Drawing up and
Signing the foregoing Articles, being the 20th Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1613.
At Seven o'Clock in the Evening, preci&s;ely, they all met at Sir HUGH
MYDDLETON'S Town Hou&s;e, which was in the <HI>Strand;</HI> and, after
con|gratulating each other on their propo&s;ed Undertaking, and drinking two
Gla&s;&s;es of Wine each, Sir HUGH got into a large Elbow Chair, and officiated
as Pre&s;ident, the re&s;t being &s;eated in common Chairs, placed there for
that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SIR HUGH then read the Que&s;tion to them, for their Night's
Debate; which was as follows:</P>
<Q>Whether the common Methods of edu|cateing Youth, in this Nation,
are not very defective, both with re&s;pecte to Morals, and a Knowledge of the
<HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Tongue?</Q>
<P>THIS Que&s;tion, the Reader will per|ceive, was a very good one,
and worthy the Con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Society. I might be
thought unpardonably <PB N="14" REF="24"> prolix, were I to tran&s;cribe the
long Ac|count which my Grand-father has given of the Debate upon this
Que&s;tion, and the many learned and ingenious Arguments produced by the
&s;everal Members; yet it would be equally unpardonable, to omit the capital
Arguments, and pa&s;s over in Silence the Manner in which this fir&s;t
Que&s;tion of <HI>The Society for Free and Can|did Enquiry,</HI> was
handled.</P>
<P>Sir HUGH, after he had read the Que&s;|tion, a&s;ked if any of the
Gentlemen pre|&s;ent cho&s;e to deliver his &s;entiments of it to the Company.
On which Mr. WHI|TAKER got up, and in a learned Speech pointed out the many
errors, which, he apprehended, prevailed in the then defec|tive Sy&s;tem of
Education. He expatiated on the Folly of the major Part of Parents of the lower
Cla&s;s, in &s;ending their Sons to School, to learn many Parts of Educa|tion,
which it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, and highly improbable, from their
&s;ituation in life, they could po&s;&s;ibly ever have any Occa&s;ion for. He
then pointed out the erroneous Methods that Schoolma&s;ters in general made
U&s;e of, to introduce Youth to the Knowledge of the Languages;
di|&s;tingui&s;hed with great Propriety and Pre|ci&s;ion, the various
Qualifications that <PB N="15" REF="25"> ought to centre in that Per&s;on, that
took on him the arduous Bu&s;ine&s;s of fa&s;hioning the juvenile Mind, and
in&s;tilling the Prin|ciples of Science; and &s;hewed how the&s;e various
Qualifications ought to be exerted towards tho&s;e committed to their Care, if
any Fruit was to be expected from the young Nur&s;ery. He then con&s;idered the
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Education, &s;o far as it related to the Morals of Youth: And
here he lamented, that the mo&s;t important &s;hould be the mo&s;t neglected
Branch of Educa|tion; that the inculcating the great Duties of Religion and
Morality, &s;hould be look'd on as of &s;uch &s;mall moment, as to be to|tally
di&s;regarded; and, in fine, that the Sy&s;tem of Education in general, left
the Minds of Youth unfurni&s;hed with real Knowledge, and their Hearts
uninfluenced by the great Principles of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>MY Grand-father enforced this Speech of Mr. WHITAKER by &s;ome
additional Arguments, and placing the others in a &s;tronger and more
&s;triking Light. But the be&s;t, and mo&s;t remarkable Speech, is that which
was made by Mr. JERVIS, who was, as appears by my MS. at that time
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Place at Court, which pro|duced him upwards of thirteeen
hundred <PB N="16" REF="26"> Pounds a Year; an immen&s;e Sum at that time! This
Speech, in my Opinion, is &s;o good, and the Complaint he makes of the
defective Methods of Education in tho&s;e Days, &s;o well adapted to the
<HI>modern</HI> Me|thod of Education, that, I think, I can|not do better than
give his Speech at full Length.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> THIS Que&s;tion, Mr. Pre&s;ident, is certainly of the
la&s;t Importance, and worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion. The
forming of the Minds of Youth, and implanting in them &s;uch Seeds as, when
ripened to Maturity, may bring forth much good Fruit, is, in my Opinion, of
more Moment than any other Subject about which we may intere&s;t our&s;elves;
and therefore de|&s;erves to be fully &s;poken to.</P>
<P> THE human Mind has been compa|red, by antient Writers, to
a Piece of Wax, that may be moulded to any Form, and is capable of receiving
any Impre&s;&s;ion, while it is young and pli|able; but when it grows old and
&s;tiff, it is with the utmo&s;t Labour, and at a va&s;t Expence of Time, that
we can imprint the Shape of what we de&s;ire, on it. <PB N="17" REF="27"> From
hence we may and mu&s;t infer, that it is the Duty of every Parent to train up
his Child to &s;uch Learning, as may in time qualify him to be a worthy Member
of that Community to which he belongs: And let it be con&s;idered too, that
Youth is the be&s;t Time for doing this, for the Rea&s;on before a&s;|&s;igned,
and al&s;o, becau&s;e &s;uch Princi|ples both of Religion, Morality and
Learning, which are inculcated, or, as it were, engraved on his Heart, will
grow with his Growth, and &s;trengthen with his Strength, and at length will be
written on the Tablet of his Soul, in &s;uch deep and legible Characters, as
Time it&s;elf &s;hall not be able to era&s;e. Con&s;ider too, Gentlemen, it is
far ea|&s;ier to learn good things, than to unlearn bad ones, which, I
apprehend, there is &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity of doing, according to the pre&s;ent
Sy&s;tem of Education pre|vailing in this Kingdom, and which I &s;hall now
endeavour to prove.</P>
<P> IN the fir&s;t Place then, I think, that the true End of
Education is both gro&s;ly neglected, and manife&s;tly perverted by the
Profe&s;&s;ors of it, not duly con&s;ider|ing the Difference of Genius in Boys,
<PB N="18" REF="28"> the different Conditions of Life in which they are placed,
and the different Pro|fe&s;&s;ions and Trades they are de&s;igned for.
Education is like a va&s;t Ba&s;on of fine Water, which belongs to a large
Town, and to which every Inhabitant has an equal Right; but every one that
would receive the Advantages of it, mu&s;t furni&s;h Conduit-Pipes to direct it
to his own Hou&s;e, in like Manner as our worthy Pre&s;ident fir&s;t planned,
and has now compleated, the Current of <HI>Ware</HI> Water, to the Hou&s;e of
every Inhabitant in <HI>London.</HI> But if our Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Education do
not duly con&s;i|der the Capacities of tho&s;e intru&s;ted to their Care, but
furni&s;h the Heads of intended Taylors, Barbers, and Shoe|makers, with &s;uch
Branches of Learn|ing, as are not only ornamental, but ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary in Divines, Law|yers, Phy&s;icians, or Gentlemen of Rank, who
want to make a Figure in the World, then Education may be truly &s;aid, like
Water running to Wa&s;te, though extremely good in it|&s;elf, to be of no real
&s;ervice to any one, but rather a Misfortune to the educated Per&s;on; &s;ince
the Length of Time employed in gathering Chaff, <PB N="19" REF="29"> might have
been much better employed in reaping Corn; by which, I mean &s;uch Parts of
Education as are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch particular Per&s;on.</P>
<P> When a Per&s;on, like that I have been de&s;cribing,
arrives to an Age, when Rea&s;on begins to exert it&s;elf, and to blaze forth
with a con&s;iderable Degree of Lu&s;tre, he finds he has mi&s;erably mi&s;pent
his Time, in learning Things which can po&s;&s;ibly be of no Service to him,
and neglecting tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary to his going through life with
Credit to him&s;elf, and Utility to So|ciety in general. Before he can
furni&s;h him&s;elf with Pieces of u&s;eful Know|ledge, it is nece&s;&s;ary
that he dive&s;t him|&s;elf of &s;ome Prejudices which he mu&s;t have
contracted, and &s;ome Things which he mu&s;t have learnt, while at School: And
it is not le&s;s difficult to do the&s;e Things, than to gain new and u&s;eful
Acqui&s;itions, in travelling the Road of Science, and rambling in the Fields
of Learning. Since then Sub|&s;tances, not Shadows, Things, not Sounds,
de&s;erve the Attention of a wi&s;e Man, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, that
Wi&s;dom and real Learning, &s;hould be taught in our public Schools and
Semi|naries. <PB N="20" REF="30"> But it may be a&s;ked, what are Wi&s;dom and
real Learning? I an&s;wer, a thorough Knowledge of the Princi|ples of the
Chri&s;tian Religion, and of the great Duties of Morality, and a competent
Knowledge of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue. But neither of the&s;e, I
ap|prehend, are taught. The dead Lan|guages only engro&s;s the Attention, and
excite the Care of Tutors and School|ma&s;ters: And, indeed, if a Knowledge of
tho&s;e Languages would facilitate the Attainment of Wi&s;dom it&s;elf, and
mend the Morals of tho&s;e that learn them, it would be a u&s;eful and an
ornamental Part of Education to every one; not only to the Prince, but
Pea&s;ant; not only to the Nobleman or Divine, but to the Trade&s;man and
Artificer. But I will be bold to &s;ay, the&s;e Things are not &s;o, nor do
they produce the&s;e ef|fects. A Knowledge of the Languages, is not Knowledge
it&s;elf, but a Key only, that being in the Hands of People of Rank and
Fortune, or tho&s;e of the learned Profe&s;&s;ions, may by them be made an
In&s;trument to unlock and open the Che&s;ts of Knowledge, from whence they may
load them&s;elves with Trea|&s;ure; but the &s;ame Things taken from 
<PB N="21" REF="31"> the&s;e Che&s;ts of Knowledge, are not only of no Value to
Men in mean Trades, or to low Arti&s;ans, but ab&s;o|lutely an Incumbrance.</P>
<P> NAY, we may go &s;till farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that the
learning of &s;ome particular Branches of Literature, has manife&s;tly a bad
Tendency to encourage in the Minds of tho&s;e Youths intended for Trade, &s;uch
Notions of Things as will ab&s;olutely di&s;qualify them from excel|ling in
their Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es; for, in&s;tead of endeavouring to become eminent in
their Trades, they will be ambitious of being thought great Scholars; though,
after all, perhaps, the Rudiments and fir&s;t Principles of Learning only they
have Capacities for acquiring. Hence a mi&s;taken Notion of their Superiority
over others in the &s;ame humble Stations of Life will ari&s;e; and the Pride
and Vanity they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which lead them to di&s;dain their Fellows,
will in|fallibly draw down on them <HI>their</HI> Con|tempt and Indignation,
and the Laugh|ter or Pity of the re&s;t of Mankind. By the&s;e Means, Men that
might have become u&s;eful Members, turn Pe&s;ts of Society, or, at lea&s;t,
mere excre&s;cences; <PB N="22" REF="32"> and thus is the Community robbed of
the Indu&s;try and Genius of many Indi|viduals, who&s;e Talents, if diverted
into a proper Channel, and exerted on pro|per Objects, might have brought
Ho|nour to their Country, Improvement to their particular Trade, and Profit to
them&s;elves and Family.</P>
<P> THE Care and Attention of a School|ma&s;ter ought to be
immediately directed to the&s;e Points. He &s;hould endeavour to di&s;cover the
particular Genius which every Boy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; for there is no Boy but
has a Genius for &s;ome Art or Science more than another; and it ought to be
cheri&s;hed, and cultivated to the utmo&s;t. Many a Man, for Want of a due
Attention to this Rule, now cuts a de&s;picable Figure as a Poverty-&s;truck
Phy&s;ician, who might have proved an ingenious Painter, and have acquired
great Fame and Wealth: And many a dull Clergyman now thumps a Cu&s;hion, or
reads a dull Compo&s;ition to a drow&s;y Audience, who might have proved an
excellent Cutler, and furni&s;hed the World with &s;uch Wares as might have
engro&s;&s;ed the Trade in that Branch of Manufac|ture <PB N="23" REF="33"> to
<HI>Britain</HI> alone, which is now &s;hared by other Nations.</P>
<P> BESIDES, con&s;ider too, Gentlemen, that the Time we are
at School is by far too long, and too precious to be thrown idly away; which it
mo&s;t cer|tainly is, if not properly employ'd. No le&s;s than &s;even or eight
Years is thought &s;ufficient to lay in a proper Stock of Learning, even for
the lowe&s;t Rank of People; and what that Learning is, I have before told you.
For my Part, I mu&s;t pronounce it a mo&s;t ridiculous Piece of Vanity, in the
lowe&s;t Order of People, to have their Children taught <HI>Latin, Greek,
French,</HI> the Mathema|tics, or any other Branch of Literature, which is not
immediately nece&s;&s;ary and requi&s;ite to them in the Trades they are
de&s;igned for: And I would gladly know, whether, to weigh a Pound of Ra&s;ins
or Sugar, to make a full-bot|tomed Peruque, to cut out a Suit of Cloaths, or to
&s;ell a Pair of Shoes, a Man that is illiterate is not as well qua|lified as
he that under&s;tands <HI>Algebra</HI> or <HI>Greek?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="34"> I AM not, Gentlemen, &s;peaking
again&s;t the Utility of &s;uch Branches of Learning; but I am for confining
them to their proper Learners: nor am I to be under&s;tood as an Enemy to
Trade&s;men and Arti&s;ans partaking of the common Advantages that flow from
Literature; but I am for limitting them to &s;uch Branches of it as may be for
their own Good. What the&s;e Branches are is very evident; a Know|ledge of
their own Tongue, &s;o as to be capable of reading and &s;peaking it with
Propriety; a Knowledge of the Principles of their Religion; and a Knowledge
al&s;o of Writing and Arith|metic: And the&s;e, in my Opinion, are &s;ufficient
for People intended for mean Trades.</P>
<P> I SHALL now, Gentlemen, &s;hew you another Defect in the
Conduct of our Schools; and that is, an improper Choice of Books. Sure I am,
that a great Number of Books now univer|&s;ally made U&s;e of, are a Di&s;grace
to Humanity, and a Scandal to a Chri&s;tian Nation. It has ever been an Opinion
of mine, that without a Peru&s;al of <PB N="25" REF="35"> HORACE, JUVENAL,
CATULLUS, MARTIAL, in our tender Years, we might attain a thorough Knowledge of
the <HI>Latin</HI> Language; and we might under&s;tand <HI>Greek</HI> without
learning ARISTOPHANES. All the&s;e Authors were great Libertines, and &s;peak
of a de|te&s;table Vice, that reflects Di&s;honour on Human Nature, in &s;uch
Terms, as &s;hew their Approbation and Practice of it; and I mu&s;t declare it
as my Opinion, that had &s;uch Authors not have men|tioned it in the Manner
they do, the Vice it&s;elf would have been unknown to, and unpracti&s;ed by
&s;ucceeding Ages. Were there no other Cau&s;e but this, tho&s;e Authors ought
never to enter a School; and &s;urely, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of learning
<HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> without them, can never be pleaded, when we
have <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Writers that have written on the mo&s;t important
Subjects, in a pure and cla&s;&s;ical Style, in &s;uch great Num|bers.</P>
<P> THE Knowledge of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue is of the
la&s;t Importance to every one; but this great Branch is al|mo&s;t entirely
neglected. We do not learn to <HI>&s;peak</HI> it at all; and how we are 
<PB N="26" REF="36"> taught to <HI>read</HI> it, I leave to every one's own
Experience. In <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> which, perhaps, we have no
Occa&s;ion to make U&s;e of above once a Year, no Pains, no Expence, is thought
too great to make us Adepts; but to make us &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> well,
which we have Occa&s;ion to do every Day of our Lives, no Expence, no Pains are
be&s;towed on us.</P>
<P> In the&s;e &s;everal Particulars I have mentioned, I
think the common Me|thods of educating Youth in this Na|tion, are very
defective; and, I think, that Man who would point out a proper Remedy for
the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, would de|&s;erve well of Society, and be ju&s;tly
con&s;idered as a Friend to Mankind in general. I &s;hall mention one, which, I
think, would contribute not a little to cure the Di&s;orders that mu&s;t
inevita|bly en&s;ue from the pre&s;ent defective Sy&s;tem; for he mu&s;t be a
bad Man who &s;hews us our Unhappine&s;s, and does not in &s;ome Mea&s;ure
endeavour to re|move it.</P>
<P> THE remedy then which I imagine would be &s;erviceable in
the literary Di&s;|ea&s;e <PB N="27" REF="37"> I am &s;peaking of, is, to
compel all tho&s;e who &s;et up public Schools for the Education of Youth, to
wait on four or five Clergymen of Integrity and Learn|ing, to be examined with
Re&s;pect to their Abilities, and to receive under their Hands, duly
atte&s;ted, proper Cer|tificates of their being capable of under|taking that
great Work, previous to their actually engaging in it. Were this to be done,
the Number of School|ma&s;ters would be greatly reduced; but it would excite a
&s;ufficient Number of able Men to engage in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Teaching, as
the fewer there were of them, the greater would be their Profit.</P>
<P>I COULD point out more Methods, Mr. Pre&s;ident, to
advance Education, but I have been already too prolix, and therefore &s;hall
tre&s;pa&s;s no more on your Time at pre&s;ent, but propo&s;e a Que&s;|tion on
that Subject for our debating &s;ome future evening.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>How far the&s;e Complaints of one of the fir&s;t Members of the
Di&s;puting Society, made one hundred and fifty one Years ago, were ju&s;t,
appears by the unanimous Ap|plau&s;e my Grand-father has ob&s;erved was 
<PB N="28" REF="38"> given to his Speech: And how far appli|cable his
Ob&s;ervations on the defective Sy|&s;tem of Education then in Vogue, are to
the pre&s;ent, I leave to the Determination of every learned Reader.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Monday,</HI> being the 27th of
<HI>October,</HI> 1613, the Society met for the &s;econd Time. This Meeting was
held at the Hou&s;e of THOMAS VENNE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Man of an immen&s;e
Fortune, and great Erudition, at his Hou&s;e in St. <HI>James's
Square.</HI></P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion debated that Evening, was,</P>
<Q>Whether, notwith&s;tanding the Complaints made both by the Clergye
and Laitye of the Degeneracye of the Age, the Moderns are not more virtuous and
wi&s;e than the Ancients?</Q>
<P>IN di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this Que&s;tion, many learn|ed and ingenious
Arguments were produ|ced by the Members, in Support both of the Affirmative and
Negative Sides of it: But the major Part of the Society were for the
Affirmative, and evidently demon|&s;trated the Superiority of the then
pre&s;ent <PB N="29" REF="39"> Age to any former, both with Re&s;pect to their
Knowledge of the Arts and Sciences, and their leading more exemplary Lives.
They proved the&s;e two Opinions, by the infallible Evidence of Scripture,
drawing a Compari&s;on between the Principles and Manners of the People of old,
with the pre&s;ent, wherein the latter appeared infi|nitely more wi&s;e, and
not near &s;o wicked as the Holy Writings inform us the World antiently was.
They then enquired into the Cau&s;e of public Speakers and Writers
repre&s;enting the Degeneracy of the Age in &s;uch lively Colours, and their
being &s;unk deeper into the Pits of Iniquity and Ignorance than any former
Ages; and they &s;uppo&s;ed it to ari&s;e from the Want of a Reli&s;h for
innocent Gratifications, in tho&s;e public Speakers and Writers; from their
having been di&s;appointed in their Pur|&s;uits and Expectations, which
&s;owered their Minds, and gave them a Di&s;gu&s;t to the World; and from Pride
and Vani|ty, which &s;welling their Souls, and in|toxicating their
Imaginations, made them look down with Contempt from their own fancied Height
of Excellence, on tho&s;e they imagined &s;o far beneath them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="40"> THE next Time of their Meeting was on
<HI>Monday</HI> the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> at my Grand-father's Hou&s;e near
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> but I &s;hould be too prolix, were I to relate the
Particulars of this Meeting, and the &s;everal Arguments which this ingenious
Set of Gentlemen made U&s;e of in the debating of their Que&s;tion. I &s;hall
how|ever inform my Reader what that Que&s;tion was, and mention a few others,
which were debated in their Turn at the Hou&s;es of the other Members.</P>
<Q>Whether, from the various Accounts gi|ven to us in Hi&s;torie, we
may not rea&s;onablie conclude, that <HI>Demo&s;t|henes</HI> was a greater
Orator than <HI>Cicero?</HI></Q>
<Q>Whether the Manufacture of Broad Cloth might not be carried to a
&s;till greater Degree of Perfection?</Q>
<P>THIS Que&s;tion was agreed by the So|ciety to be debated on again
the next <HI>Mon|day</HI> Night, which was the 24th of <HI>Novem|ber;</HI> and
the Subject being, in their Opinion, of the greate&s;t Importance, and not
ex|hau&s;ted, after they had again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed it <PB N="31" REF="41"> that
Evening, it was agreed that it &s;hould be a Subject for their Entertainment a
third Night.</P>
<Q>Whether Emulation in brave and noble Minds, and Envy in cowardly
and ba&s;e ones, are not Acquirements in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors own Power?</Q>
<P>ON this Que&s;tion I mu&s;t remark, that, however intelligible it
might be at that Time of the Day, it is not &s;o now; nor do I &s;ee what
Purpo&s;e the propo&s;ing it could &s;erve&mdash;no Debates appear by my
Manu&s;cript to have been made upon it.</P>
<Q>Whether the Improvement of our Heads and the Improvement of our
Hearts, do not go Hand in Hand?</Q>
<Q>What Kind of Education is the mo&s;t proper for a Nobleman, a
Gentleman, and a Trade&s;man?</Q>
<Q>What Regulations or Improvements are needful to be made, in Order
to ad|vance the great Work of Education in this Kingdom?</Q>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="42">Whether, if a Committee or Number of Gentlemen
of acknowledged Abilities, were appointed either to draw up, or to alter the
Epitaphs which, according to the pre&s;ent Method, di&s;grace our Church-Yards,
it would not reflect Honour on the Nation, and excite a higher Opinion of our
Wi&s;dom in the Minds of judicious Foreigners?</Q>
<Q>Whether the Stage, under proper Regu|lations, might not be made an
Aid to Wi&s;dom, an Enforcer of Virtue, and a Supplement to the Pulpit?</Q>
<Q>Whether a Spendthrift or a Mi&s;er, is the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s
Member of the Com|munity?</Q>
<P>ON this Que&s;tion, my Grand-father made a Remark, which I cannot
forbear tran&s;cribing.</P>
<Q>A Spendthrift, &s;ays he, is like a Gra&s;hopper, and a Mi&s;er
like a Jack|daw. The former di&s;&s;ipates his Sub|&s;tance, and &s;ings away
his Time, in his Summer of Life, regardle&s;s of what may happen to him in
Winter, and <PB N="33" REF="43"> not con&s;idering that wilful Wa&s;te brings
woeful Want; and the latter hides the Trea&s;ure he has collected, and which he
can never enjoy. They both are Fools, and unfit for Society; but the Mi&s;er, I
think, is mo&s;t &s;o. The Mi&s;er is a mere Muckworm, a Dunghill|maker, that
has brought together a Quantity of Manure, which, if pro|perly di&s;tributed,
would enrich the na|tional Soil; the Spendthrift, however an Enemy to
him&s;elf, is the generous Hand that &s;catters the rich Dung, that doth Good
to Thou&s;ands.</Q>
<Q>Whether the Difference of Genius, ob&s;er|vable in the People of
different Na|tions, is owing to the Climate, Soil, Form of Government, or
Education?</Q>
<Q>Whether an hypocritical Sinner, or an open and audacious one, be
the greate&s;t Enemy to Society?</Q>
<P>SUCH were the fir&s;t thirteen Que&s;tions debated by the then
infant Society, at their Meetings at the Members Hou&s;es; the la&s;t of which
was held at the Hou&s;e of my Grand-father.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="44"> I SHALL now take a Liberty frequently u&s;ed
by Biographers, and other Writers, that of &s;kipping over a long Space of
Time, in which nothing material happened in the Society, &s;ave that it
increa&s;ed in Numbers and in Fame.</P>
<P>FOR no le&s;s than eight-and-twenty Years was it continued on the
&s;ame Principles, and conducted in the &s;ame Manner, as at its fir&s;t
E&s;tabli&s;hment, during all which Time my Grand-father belonged to it, who
has not only pre&s;erved in a large Folio Book all the Que&s;tions propo&s;ed,
but al&s;o the Debates on tho&s;e that were more particu|larly intere&s;ting,
or which more forcibly excited his Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>FROM whatever Cau&s;e it was owing, I know not, but for half a
Year the Society was adjourned, which was the Summer of 1641. I have been
&s;ometimes tempted to impute it to the particular Severity of the U&s;urper's
Government, and the criti|cal Exigency of the Times; but that could not be the
Ca&s;e, as the Meetings were again held in <HI>October,</HI> being at the Time
of the dreadful <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ma&s;&s;acre, when no le&s;s than 45,000 Souls
were cruelly mur|dered; <PB N="35" REF="45"> though &s;ome Writers, for &s;ome
&s;ini&s;ter Views, or Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, have
dimini&s;hed the Numbers that fell by the Hands of the Murderers, more than
two-thirds.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after their a&s;&s;embling toge|ther again, a great Number
of Gentlemen of Rank and Fortune, having heard of their Fame, and approving
their Scheme, offered them&s;elves as Members: But the Society imagining that
it would be ex|tremely inconvenient for a greater Number of Members to meet
together, refu&s;ed ad|mitting them, and declared they would not alter, or
break in on their original Plan.</P>
<P>IN this Manner they continued 'till the Re&s;toration of King
CHARLES II. in 1660; and to &s;hew in what E&s;teem they were held, I &s;hall
tran&s;cribe the following curious Anecdote, which the Reader may depend on as
a Matter of Fact.</P>
<Q>OUR Society now began to attract the public Attention in a very
particu|lar Manner, and was &s;o much di&s;cour|&s;ed of, and &s;o
univer&s;ally applau&s;ed, that it even excited Maje&s;ty it&s;elf to pay 
<PB N="36" REF="46"> us a Vi&s;it. He was introduced to us by Sir HUGH, who
inform'd us he was a di&s;tant Relation of his; that coming lately from the
Country, and hearing of our Fame, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, was de&s;irous of
hearing him&s;elf tho&s;e Debates which the World talk'd &s;o loudly of. Now
&s;everal of us would have known the King, had he appear'd in <HI>propri&acirc;
Per&s;on&acirc;,</HI> but he had put a Piece of black Silk over his left Cheek,
which almo&s;t cover'd it; and his Eye|brows which were quite black, he had by
&s;ome Artifice or other, converted to a light brown, or rather to a flaxen
Colour, and had di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in his Apparel and Looks &s;o
effectually, that none of us knew him; and of this Circum&s;tance my good
Friend, Sir HUGH, was entirely &s;ilent 'till two Years afterwards, being, no
Doubt, &s;o caution'd by his Maje&s;ty.</Q>
<P>THIS little Anecdote throws a farther Light on the Character of
that facetious Monarch, who, as we may gather from Hi&s;tory, lov'd a Frolic at
his Heart, and was never happier than when at &s;ome pub|lic Entertainments, or
A&s;&s;emblies, of his Subjects, where he might throw off the 
<PB N="37" REF="47"> cumbrous Robes of Maje&s;ty, and give a free and natural
Vent to his humorous Di&s;|po&s;ition. I find that he was &s;o well
en|tertain'd with the Debates of the Society, that he came there three Times
more, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf greatly &s;atisfied with an In&s;titution,
which, he declared, had &s;o great a Tendency to enlarge the Mind, and to
refine the Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THE Society had now exi&s;ted forty-&s;even Years, and of the
Members that fir&s;t form'd it, two only &s;urviv'd, my Grand|father and Sir
HUGH. But it being like the immortal Regiment of FREDERICK II. King of
<HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> &s;upplied with new Mem|bers as the old ones dropp'd off,
there was no Doubt of its Di&s;&s;olution, e&s;pecially as they took Care to
elect &s;uch Men only as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Integrity and Abilities; for
it was an invariable Maxim with them that none but &s;uch &s;hould be admitted,
let their Station in Life, Age, Connections, or Fortune, be what they
would.</P>
<P>FIVE Years after this Time, the dread|ful Plague happen'd, which
carried off no le&s;s than &s;ixty-eight Thou&s;and five Hundred and
eighty-&s;ix Souls, Men, Women, and Children. Among them was my Grand|father, 
<PB N="38" REF="48"> who, after being &s;eized with it, and continuing
exce&s;&s;ively ill for eleven Days, departed this Life in the
eighty-&s;e|venth Year of his Age, having for the la&s;t fifty-two Years been a
Member of the Society for free Enquiry, of which he was the fir&s;t Propo&s;er
and Promoter, and, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir HUGH MYDDLE|TON, the chief
E&s;tabli&s;her.</P>

Fidelity, involved as it is in the Darkne&s;s of Time) and to &s;atisfy the
Expectations of the Reader, we &s;hall think our&s;elves very happy. It is
true, that we could have been more minute in the De&s;cription of &s;everal
Things; could have tran&s;cribed many Speeches of various Members on different
Subjects, which we have entirely omitted; and have given <HI>all</HI> the
Que&s;tions that were debated by the Society from their fir&s;t
E&s;tabli&s;hment in 1613, to the Time of my Grand-father's Death in 1665. But
the doing the&s;e Things we have conceived unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince it mu&s;t
have been very dry and in|&s;ipid to our Readers, a very di&s;agreeable Ta&s;k
for our&s;elves, and would have &s;wel|led this Hi&s;tory to an enormous
Size.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now, in this Second Part, continue our Hi&s;tory from
my Grand|father's Death, till the Removal of the Society to the
<HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Street,</HI> when its original Plan
was alter'd, and its Conduct became very different; and &s;hew its various
Fortune, till its la&s;t Tran&s;|migration to the <HI>Robinhood</HI> in
<HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> where it now continues to be held.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="51"> MY Father, for &s;ome Years before my
Grand-father's Death, had been admitted a Member of the Society, and was looked
on as a very intelligent and worthy Man. He was not le&s;s fond of it than my
Grand|father, and no le&s;s particular in tran&s;cri|bing from the Club-Book
the various Que|&s;tions that were in&s;erted there, and the &s;everal
Arguments that pa&s;&s;ed <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> on the Subjects, when
they came to be debated. This he performed in the &s;ame large Folio Book my
Grand-father made U&s;e of for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and which being now in my
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, enables me to compile this Work.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1667 the Society had &s;ome Thoughts of enlarging
their Plan, and admitting more Members. They had re|ceived Applications from
&s;everal Men of Quality, and great Numbers of others di|&s;tingui&s;hed for
Wit and Judgment, for their being admitted to partake of the In|&s;truction and
Entertainment which their Debates afforded; but &s;o general an Ad|mi&s;&s;ion
was deemed impracticable, on Ac|count of the great Inconvenience the Members
would all be put to, in their Turn, to entertain &s;o many Per&s;ons, and 
<PB N="42" REF="52"> therefore &s;uch Applications were to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>OCCASIONAL Vi&s;itants had been, how|ever, allowed the Liberty of
being pre&s;ent at the Debates, and to &s;peak them&s;elves to the Que&s;tion
if they thought proper. Re|&s;traint irritates De&s;ire, and Things forbid|den
have greater Charms for Mankind, than tho&s;e they are at free Liberty to
en|joy. So proved it with tho&s;e Gentlemen, who, though they had been
pre&s;ent at the Debates of the Society, were not Mem|bers of it. Enraged to
find they had not the Liberty of becoming Members, they deviated from the
Que&s;tions they &s;hould have &s;poken to; and complained, that a Society that
was not free for the Reception of every one in general that had an Incli|nation
to frequent it, could have no good Effect, and that, &s;uppo&s;ing its
Influence on the Manners and Principles of tho&s;e that attended it ever &s;o
great, the Public in general could reap no Advantage from it.</P>
<P>IN this Manner the Society went on for &s;ome Time, and the
Debates were a mot|ly Mixture of angry Cen&s;ures and &s;olid Arguments,
Animadver&s;ions on the Que|&s;tions propo&s;ed, and Complaints of the 
<PB N="43" REF="53"> narrow Spirit of the Society: So that the original
Intention of the fir&s;t Members was entirely fru&s;trated, and the
Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure which mu&s;t always ari&s;e from a reciprocal
Communication of Sentiments between learned and ingenious Men, gave Way to
private Cabals and per&s;onal Invec|tives; which will ever check the Growth of
Knowledge, and choak up the Paths of Truth.</P>
<P>TO put a Stop to the&s;e Proceedings, one of the Members, a Man of
a violent Spirit, and boi&s;terous Di&s;po&s;ition, propo&s;ed it to the
Con&s;ideration of the Society, whether it would not be advi&s;eable to
refu&s;e Admit|tance, for the future, to any Gentleman whatever, that might
de&s;ire to be an occa|&s;ional Vi&s;itant, and to make &s;uch an Order in
their Book. And he gave it as his Opi|nion, that without doing it, the Society
mu&s;t &s;oon fall to the Ground, by the Up|roar and tumultuous Proceedings
which frequently prevailed there.</P>
<P>HE was &s;econded in his Motion by ano|ther of the Members, a Man
of like Tem|per with him&s;elf; who al&s;o gave it as his Opinion, that no
Per&s;on whatever, let his Fortune or Rank in Life be what it would, 
<PB N="44" REF="54"> ought to be admitted as an occa&s;ional Vi&s;i|tant. He
ob&s;erved, that their Society was of a private Nature; and that, for People to
in&s;i&s;t on pu&s;hing into their Company, and hearing their Sentiments of Men
and Things, whether they would or not, was an unparallelled Piece of
A&s;&s;urance, and equally unmannerly with a Beggar, that, cloathed in Rags and
Wretchedne&s;s, yet, full of a true <HI>Hibernian</HI> Impudence, would force
his Way into a Gentleman's Parlour again&s;t his Con&s;ent. He expatiated
largely on the Folly of fir&s;t permitting any Gentle|man to attend there who
was not a Mem|ber, and ob&s;erved, that though it was a Cu&s;tom to grant
&s;uch Permi&s;&s;ion, yet the Breach of fooli&s;h Cu&s;toms is better than the
Ob&s;ervance of them: And concluded, by remarking, that if they had, in that
Re|&s;pect, travelled on in a wrong Road for fif|teen Years la&s;t pa&s;t,
there was no Rea&s;on they &s;hould &s;till travel in it, e&s;pecially as they
had then experienced the Inconveni|encies that aro&s;e from it.</P>
<P>THE many Debates and Arguments they had at various Times on this
Topic, at la&s;t produced the following Que&s;tion:</P>
<Q><PB N="45" REF="55">Whether it is proper to allow any Gentle|man,
who is not a regularly cho&s;en Member of this Society, a Liberty of attending
it?</Q>
<P>THIS Que&s;tion gave Ri&s;e to many Ar|guments on both Sides, and
produced no &s;mall Commotion. The two hot-headed Members I have ju&s;t
mentioned, were of Opinion, that no Man, however dignified or
di&s;tingui&s;hed, ought to have Liberty of coming there; and urged all the
Argu|ments they were Ma&s;ters of to &s;upport their Opinions; which they did
not do with the calm Demeanour of a venerable and pacific NESTOR, who&s;e Words
fall from him like Flakes of Snow, that melted as they fell, but with all the
Fire and Fury of an enraged AJAX.</P>
<P>AS the I&s;&s;ue of this Debate produced a Revolution in the
Society not le&s;s remark|able, in Proportion to the Numbers that were affected
by it, than the Revolution in the State that happened but two Years afterwards,
I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the Speech that my Father made on the Occa&s;ion, and
which, he declares, made &s;uch an Impre&s;|&s;ion on them, that they followed
his Ad|vice, <PB N="46" REF="56"> in the Alteration and Enlargement of their
Plan.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> I LOOK on this Que&s;tion, Gentlemen to be of no &s;mall
Importance; as not only the Well-being, but the very Ex|i&s;tence of our
Society mu&s;t depend on the Determination we make concerning it, and the
Influence &s;uch Determina|tion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have on our Con|duct. It
has been allowed, ye all know, for Gentlemen, recommended by any Member of our
Society, to be pre&s;ent at our Debates. How long it has been allowed, I cannot
&s;ay; but it has been &s;o ever &s;ince I have had the Honour of belonging to
it. The Ad|vantage our Society derives from this Permi&s;&s;ion is not
incon&s;iderable. It re|ceives a Lu&s;tre and Character from the Reports which
our occa&s;ional Vi&s;itants make of it to their Friends; and thus Men of real
Genius and Learning are induced to vi&s;it us, and by their hear|ing our
Debates, and li&s;tening to our Sentiments on Subjects of Importance, or
Matters of Controver&s;y, they are excited to give us theirs; and thus we are
mutually improved, and mutually obligated. Be&s;ides, con&s;ider that very 
<PB N="47" REF="57"> frequently not one Half of the Members attend, and if
occa&s;ional Vi&s;itants were not then to come among us, the De|bates would
grow languid, and no Ar|gument could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Tho&s;e Gentle|men that are
for having no Per&s;ons to partake of the Entertainment they may expect, and
&s;eek for here, but Mem|bers, &s;eem to re&s;emble an avaritious, covetous old
Mi&s;er, that hoards up his Bags, and would have no one the bet|ter for them.
Let us not be mi&s;ers in Knowledge, but de&s;pi&s;e the Character as much as
we do him that clo&s;ets up his Gold. The wor&s;t Avarice is that of Wi&s;dom;
and if we really po&s;&s;e&s;s any, let us act like the generous Man, and the
good Chri&s;tian, that will commu|nicate to others the good Things that he
hath, and give unto him that want|eth: If we have not that Wi&s;dom which we
may imagine, and without Vanity imagine, People think we have, and which they
come here to partake of, they will, perhaps, give us &s;ome. Ye all know,
Gentlemen, that in the Di|&s;tribution of Things of this Kind, he that gives
away the mo&s;t is never the poorer for it; his Trea&s;ures are not the more
exhau&s;ted: Then let us not <PB N="48" REF="58"> be afraid that ours will be
&s;o, but rather hope that we &s;hall be enriched by the Trea&s;ures of tho&s;e
that often vi&s;it us, and frequently come to us very oppor|tunely in the
Ab&s;ence of &s;ome of our Members.</P>
<P> ONE Gentleman has ob&s;erved, that fooli&s;h Cu&s;toms
ought to be broke through; and that if we have travelled in a wrong Road for
&s;ome Time, it is proper to quit it, and travel in a right Road. I allow it,
Gentlemen; but he ought to have <HI>proved</HI> the&s;e two Things: He ought to
have &s;hewn that our Ad|mi&s;&s;ion of Vi&s;iters was a fooli&s;h Cu&s;|tom,
and that the Road we had hitherto travelled in was a wrong one; but he has not
done the&s;e Things; he has on|ly given us his mere <HI>Ip&s;e Dixit.</HI></P>
<P> HE has ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that for People to pu&s;h
them&s;elves into our So|ciety, to hear our Debates, is as un|mannerly as for a
Beggar to pu&s;h, with|out Permi&s;&s;ion, into a Gentleman's Parlour. This I
deny. Gentlemen that come here, do it by the Liberty that is given to each
Member, to bring one Friend with him; and therefore, <PB N="49" REF="59"> that
is not a Ca&s;e <HI>in Point.</HI> As to the Inconveniencies that have
ari&s;en, and the Tumults that have been rai&s;ed, they have not been owing to
our admitting Vi&s;iters, as that Gentleman has a&s;&s;erted, but to our not
admitting more. And really, I am of Opinion, that a Society for free and candid
Inquiry, ought to be a free rnd candid Society. But how can it be a free one,
if Gentlemen are denied Entrance? How can it be a candid one, if we ob&s;truct
the Propaga|tion of Knowledge?&mdash;In &s;hort, Gentle|men, I think our Plan
might be im|proved, and a very nece&s;&s;ary Reforma|tion take Place; a
Reformation that will put a Stop to all Manner of Di&s;tur|bances, and
increa&s;e our Reputation by the Acce&s;&s;ion of more Members.</P>
<P> YOU experience very clearly, Gentle|men, that the chief
Inconveniencies we are put to, is the Want of Room. Could we but get a larger
Place, ca|pable of holding conveniently a lar|ger Company, we &s;hould neither
be &s;o crowded, nor would the Debates meet with &s;uch Ob&s;tructions.
Be&s;ides, to &s;peak my Sentiments plainly, I don't <PB N="50" REF="60"> think
that meeting at each other's Hou&s;es is at all proper. We put our|&s;elves to
many Inconveniencies we might avoid; we &s;uffer many Per|plexities we have no
Occa&s;ion to &s;uffer; and we di&s;order our Family Affairs, when we might
avoid doing it.</P>
<P> I AM confident, Gentlemen, there is not a Man among ye,
how attached &s;oever he is to the Intere&s;t of the Socie|ty, but dreads the
Approach of that <HI>Monday,</HI> when, perhaps, no le&s;s than fifty People
are to a&s;&s;emble; and &s;ome of us perfectly tremble at it. For my Part, I
mu&s;t conte&s;s, that on the <HI>Mon|day</HI> Evening the Society meets at my
Hou&s;e, I am the unhappie&s;t Creature imaginable; my Wife di&s;likes it, and
my Servants dete&s;t it. I doubt not but this is the Ca&s;e with ye all,
Gentlemen, though your Re&s;pect for the Society, and for one another, has
prevented your making Mention of it. The Method of Meeting at each other's
Hou&s;es might be extremely proper for the So|ciety in its Infancy; but I don't
appre|hend it is &s;o now. The &s;ame Rea&s;ons do not now exi&s;t as might
then; and <PB N="51" REF="61"> therefore we are not under the &s;ame Obligation
to follow the &s;ame Method of Procedure in this Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WHEN this Society was fir&s;t in&s;titu|ted, which was
fifty-three Years ago, there were only fifteen Members that compo&s;ed it; and
no more were added to it for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time. No Member then brought
a Friend with him; &s;o that the Society might then be, with great Propriety,
&s;tiled a private one. But that is not the Ca&s;e now. Our Number of
e&s;tabli&s;hed Members doubles theirs, and the Number of oc|ca&s;ional
Vi&s;itants that come among us, allowing for the Ab&s;ence of &s;ome Mem|bers
every <HI>Monday</HI> Night, at lea&s;t trebles it. The Inconveniency that
&s;uch a Num|ber of People occa&s;ion to a Family I have before &s;et forth;
and therefore &s;hall now deliver it as my Opinion, that this is a Grievance
that wants a &s;peedy Re|dre&s;s, and demands our Attention much more than,
whether it is proper to al|low Gentlemen, not Members of our Society, a Liberty
of attending it.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>This Speech was received with univer&s;al Applau&s;e. Even the
Gentlemen that op|po&s;ed <PB N="52" REF="62"> my Father in the former Part of
his Speech, could not but join with him in the latter; and they all came to a
Re&s;olution, that their meeting at one another's Hou&s;es to debate, threw
their Families into great Confu&s;ion, was improper in it&s;elf, and re|quired
an Alteration.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of this Opinion, the Society came to a
Determination, of having their Meetings at &s;ome Tavern or Coffee|hou&s;e,
where they might be accommoda|ted with a Room &s;ufficient to hold a large
Number of Gentlemen, and where every one, who&s;e Curio&s;ity excited him to
attend the Debates, might have a Liberty of en|tering.</P>
<P>IT may ea&s;ily be imagined, that in a City like <HI>London,</HI>
it could not be a very long Time before a Hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a
Room was di&s;covered. Indeed, many &s;uch occurred to the Minds of the
Mem|bers; but that which &s;eemed mo&s;t com|modious, and be&s;t adapted to
their Pur|po&s;e, was the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head</HI> in
<HI>E&s;&s;ex-Street.</HI></P>
<P>TO this Hou&s;e, therefore, &s;everal of the Members went; and
having examined it very attentively, reported to their Bre|thren, 
<PB N="53" REF="63"> on their Return, that it would, with &s;ome Alterations,
an&s;wer their Pur|po&s;e extremely well; that they had &s;poken to the
Landlord concerning it; and that he had promi&s;ed to do every Thing in his
Power to make it agreeable to them.</P>
<P>THE Society received this Account with general Approbation; and
informing the Landlord of the Nature of their Club, he fitted up the large&s;t
Room in his Hou&s;e, fixing Benches therein, &s;o as to make it contain upwards
of an hundred Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE Rules and Orders the Society had before ob&s;erved, were now
altered. <HI>Be|fore,</HI> every Member had, in his Turn, defray'd the whole
Expence attendant on the Meeting held at his Hou&s;e; but <HI>now,</HI> they
ordered, that every Member, and every Per&s;on that came to the Society to hear
their Debates, &s;hould, previous to his Admi&s;&s;ion into the Club-Room, take
a Ticket at the Bar, for which he &s;hould pay Six-pence: That every Six-pence
&s;o paid would be received by the Landlord; in Con&s;ideration of which, he
&s;hould furni&s;h them with as much <HI>Porter</HI> and <HI>Lemonade</HI> as
would amount to the Sum total recei|ved: That the Price of both tho&s;e Kinds 
<PB N="54" REF="64"> of Liquors &s;hould be rated at Four-pence a Pot: That if
any Gentleman cho&s;e other Liquors, he &s;hould pay for them &s;eparately: And
that if any Money remained in the Landlord's Hands, after he had deducted, from
the whole Money received, the Price of the Porter and Lemonade he had
fur|ni&s;hed the Society with, it &s;hould be paid to his Servants, in
proportionable Shares, in Con&s;ideration of the Trouble they were put to.</P>
<P>THEY likewi&s;e formed &s;ome new Rules with Re&s;pect to the
Conduct of the Society, and their Methods of Debate; of which the following are
the mo&s;t remarkable.</P>

<P>THESE are the mo&s;t material new Re|gulations which the Society
made on their removing to the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head,</HI> their other Rules and
Orders being the &s;ame as before.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive what Num|bers of People attended
the Society as &s;oon as it was declared a free one, and Liberty was given to
every Per&s;on to enter it, on pay|ing Six-pence. No one Topic for
Con|ver&s;ation &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed as this. It became a general
Subject of Debate with|out Doors, as much as Philo&s;ophy, Meta|phy&s;ics, and
the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> did within. From the Courtier down to the
Pea&s;ant, from the hoary Sage down to the playful School-boy, Curio&s;ity had
extended her Influence, and excited De&s;ires in every <PB N="57" REF="67"> one
to vi&s;it an A&s;&s;embly of Men that had rendered them&s;elves &s;o
famous.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of &s;uch an univer&s;al and eager Curio&s;ity,
Multitudes of People a&s;|&s;embled at the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head</HI> every
<HI>Monday</HI> Night, &s;ome as Orators, and &s;ome as Au|ditors; &s;ome to be
in&s;tructed, &s;ome to be entertained; &s;ome to &s;ee, and &s;ome to be
&s;een; &s;ome to &s;hew their fine Cloaths, and delicate Per&s;ons; and &s;ome
to criti|ci&s;e the Speeches of the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head</HI> Ora|tors, and
entertain their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with an Account of the Debates, and di&s;play
their own Sagacity in di&s;tingui&s;hing their Merits, and their Defects.</P>
<P>IT is not more wonderful for Critics to congregate at &s;uch
Places, than for Rooks and Jackdaws to meet in the Fields of human Slaughter. A
Critic that has not the Power of &s;peaking a &s;ingle Sentence in Public, is
yet able to di&s;&s;ect the fine&s;t Ora|tions of the fine&s;t Orators; he can
dimi|ni&s;h the Graces of Elocution and Action, and exaggerate little Defects,
with all the petulance of Pedantry, and Rage of Cen|&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="68"> SUCH Critics are like Eunuchs: They have not
Vigour nor Courage to act man|fully them&s;elves, and they envy and cen|&s;ure
tho&s;e that do. When they come into a public A&s;&s;embly, it is not to
partake of its Entertainments, but to &s;eek Occa&s;ions of finding Fault, and
giving an ill-natured Turn to the mo&s;t harmle&s;s Amu&s;ements. They are like
&s;o many Hounds at a Car|ca&s;e, devouring their Prey as fa&s;t as they can,
and growling all the Time they are eating.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e a Number of the&s;e Gentlemen of a higher
Cla&s;s, the Writing Critics, who attended the Society, in Search of fre&s;h
Topics to exerci&s;e their Abilities, and amu&s;e the Public. They knew that
the Pa&s;&s;ion for Novelties mu&s;t be gratified; and when almo&s;t every
Sub|ject had been exhau&s;ted, and every Field been &s;o much traver&s;ed, as
to render the Whole a common, beaten, and highway Path, it was nece&s;&s;ary
for tho&s;e Sport&s;men to turn out of the common Road, where nothing but
common Objects, and Things that have been a thou&s;and Times de&s;cri|bed, meet
the Eye, and &s;trike into bye Lanes and covert Places, where, perhaps, 
<PB N="59" REF="69"> Plenty of original and curious Game might he &s;tarted,
hunted down with Sport and Plea|&s;ure, and be at length cooked, and &s;erved
up as a choice Di&s;h for the public Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THIS was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>E&s;&s;ex Head</HI> Society. While
it was confined within the Bounds of each Member's Hou&s;e, the Public in
general knew but little of it, and the venal Authors of tho&s;e Days, not
having Intimacy and Intere&s;t enough with any of the Members to gain
Admittance, were of Cour&s;e di&s;abled from informing the World of the Nature
of the Society, and &s;ignalizing them&s;elves, by &s;triking into a new
Species of Writing, and entertain|ing the Public with a new Subject. Not but of
late Years the Race of Writing-Critics is greatly improved. Formerly, tho&s;e
Votaries of Dullne&s;s never attempted to write on Subjects of which they had
no Knowledge; but now, grown more vivacious, and cultivating the finer Powers
of Imagination, they can traduce Men whom they never knew, refute Arguments
they do not under&s;tand, and pronounce Sentence on Books they have not
read.</P>
<P>Nay, the Writing-Critics of the pre&s;ent Age, are &s;o
&s;agacious, that even the raw <PB N="60" REF="70"> and undi&s;ciplined can
form a right Judg|ment of every new Production, by read|ing only the fir&s;t
ten Lines; and as to <HI>Veterans,</HI> the Cooks of Monthly Ha&s;hes for the
public Palate, they can di&s;cover an Author by his <HI>Style,</HI> and of
Cour&s;e know, in ten Minutes, whether they are to prai&s;e or cen&s;ure his
Piece: Though, indeed, to their Credit it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that they are
not ab&s;olute Slaves to malig|nant Obduracy; for, after they have vowed to
damn a Work and its Author to Contempt and Ob&s;curity, a Beef-Steak and a
Bottle of Wine have had a wonder|ful Efficacy in &s;oftening the Severity of
their Di&s;po&s;itions, making them adore and cheri&s;h that very Work, which,
without the Interpo&s;ition and Agency of the Wine and the Beef, they would
have butchered without Decency, and devoured without Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>SO much for Critics of every Species.&mdash;I &s;hall now return
to my Hi&s;tory, and as I am too poor to give a Beef-Steak and a Bottle to
&s;ecure it from the Reviewer's Place of Torment, it mu&s;t of Cour&s;e be
&mdash;, but no Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71"> AS the Society was now declared to be free,
and Religion and Politics, tho&s;e in|exhau&s;tible Topics of Conver&s;ation,
were allowed to be handled, the Room was crowded every Night, and Orators, like
Mu&s;hrooms in a foggy Morning, &s;tarted up from every Seat. The Exclu&s;ion
of the&s;e Subjects from their Debates before, had, in the general Opinion of
the Society, robbed them of much Entertainment and Knowledge. They, therefore,
departed from the Maxims of the original Members, who had declared, that the
Chri&s;tian Reli|gion being of Divine Original, could not but be pure and holy,
and therefore not a fit Object for the Debates of Di&s;puting Clubs; and that
for Philo&s;ophers and &s;tu|dious Men, who wanted only to cultivate their
rational Faculties by the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of u&s;eful Subjects, to wade into
the Depths of Politics, and to take on them the Li|berty of &s;crutinizing into
the Mea&s;ures of State, would be an unwarrantable Action, and productive of no
Good.</P>
<P>NAY, as it is u&s;ual not only with private Men, but with public
A&s;&s;emblies, to run into Extremes; &s;o our Society now deba|ted 
<PB N="62" REF="72"> very few Que&s;tions, but what were religious, or
political.</P>
<P>TRUE Religion, they ob&s;erved, like Silver &s;even Times purified
in the Fire, appear'd the brighter the more it was exa|mined into; and it was
the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of every Man, to &s;earch the Scrip|tures, and to
endeavour to give an An&s;wer to him that a&s;keth a Rea&s;on for the Hope that
is in him. Nay, without doing it, every Man mu&s;t be extremely criminal;
&s;ince, if the only Rea&s;on a Man can give for his being of any particular
Per&s;ua&s;ion with Re&s;pect to his Religious Principles, is, that his Father
and Mother were of the &s;ame Religion <HI>he was,</HI> and that he
profe&s;&s;ed that Religion, becau&s;e he was educated in it; then, by a Parity
of Rea|&s;on, a <HI>Hottentot,</HI> or a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> or
a <HI>Pagan,</HI> has as &s;trong Rea&s;ons for his Mode of Religious
Wor&s;hip, and is as ju&s;tifiable in the Continuance of it, as the
Chri&s;tian. As to the &s;eeming Impropriety of debating on Religion in a
Public Hou&s;e, and examining into its Principles over a Pot of Beer, they
concluded, it was not only warrantable, but laudable, and infi|nitely better
than doing it in private <PB N="63" REF="73"> Hou&s;es, where they could not
have an Opportunity to in&s;truct their Minds and refre&s;h their Bodies at the
&s;ame Time: For they in&s;i&s;ted, that in all Debates whatever, more
e&s;pecially on Religion, the Conver&s;ation grows languid and in&s;ipid, in
Proportion as the Speakers grow hungry and thir&s;ty; and therefore, a Welch
Rab|bit and a Pot of Beer, were as nece&s;&s;ary Requi&s;ites for a
profe&s;&s;ed Orator, as Know|ledge and Elocution, or even a Subject to
harangue on.</P>
<P>AS to the Admi&s;&s;ion of Political Que&s;|tions, they
ob&s;erv'd, that in this Land of Liberty, where the Godde&s;s her&s;elf reigns
with &s;o much Lu&s;tre, and infu&s;es her chearing Influence into every
Brea&s;t, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every one who has the Good of
his Country at Heart, to &s;crutinize into, and examine the Mea&s;ures which
are from Time to Time taken by our State Pilots, in the Management of, and
&s;teering the Political Ve&s;&s;el: That it is a Duty incumbent on every Man
in a free State, in a Rank of Life, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of Abilities beyond
the Vulgar, to fathom the Depths of Government, and to point out and expo&s;e
the hidden Rocks <PB N="64" REF="74"> and dangerous Shoals, on which
State&s;men often &s;plit: That as we are all Links of one great Chain, we are
all intere&s;ted in the Fate of each other, and bound by the mo&s;t &s;olemn
Ties of doing our utmo&s;t, for the Support and Welfare of that Com|munity to
which we belong: And, that though to direct the Helm of State requires an able
Head and an incorrupt Heart, Practice and Experience, Courage and Prudence;
yet, it has been found, that as a Pigmy mounted on the Shoulders of a Giant,
may be able to &s;ee farther than the Giant him&s;elf, &s;o People not
conver&s;ant with State Affairs, may &s;trike out &s;ome Road, that, being
pur&s;ued, may lead to Glory and Happine&s;s, and make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations,
of which tho&s;e that have the Direction of public Affairs, may avail
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e, and &s;ome other Rea&s;ons <HI>equally</HI> cogent,
they determined, that Re|ligion and Politics &s;hould find a Place in their
Debates, and employ their Attention as much as any other Subjects.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Que&s;tion they had of a reli|gious Nature, was the
following; which the Reader will perceive was as ingenious <PB N="65" REF="75">
as it was mode&s;t, highly emblematical of that Freedom of Enquiry which
afterwards prevailed in that free Society.</P>
<Q>Whether Faith and Belief are not one and the &s;ame Thing? And, if
&s;o, Whether it is in the lea&s;t meritorious to believe what we cannot help
upon the Conviction of the Sen&s;es? 
<BIBL>ANTI-FIDELIS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>MANY Arguments were urged on both Sides, and Religion and Rea&s;on
were ban|died to and fro by the various Di&s;putants, as a Foot-ball is by a
Company of Soldiers, or a Shuttlecock by the alternate Strokes of &s;ounding
Battledores.</P>
<P>THE Affirmatives &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted that Faith was nothing
but a Conviction in the Mind, of the Truth of any particular Doctrine, or
Thing; that we could not help, from the internal Evidence we have of Things, to
believe or di&s;believe them; that in Con&s;equence of our examining them, we
form our Opinion, or in other Words, our Faith; and that &s;ince the Evidence
produced within every Man's Mind, is more or le&s;s forcible, in Propor|tion as
it &s;trikes the Imagination, it is no <PB N="66" REF="76"> Wonder that the
Opinion, or Faith of Mankind, &s;hould be &s;o greatly different, and that one
&s;hould firmly believe what another &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly denies. They
al|ledged, that if a Man did all in his Power to arrive at a due Knowledge of
Things, and in Con&s;equence of his gaining the be&s;t Information he could,
grounded his Belief, he was not culpable, let that Belief be what it would; but
any one that &s;its down contented with Things as he finds them, and believes
them without a free and im|partial Examination of their Nature and Tendency, is
extremely culpable; &s;ince he only believes what he has been taught, as a
Parrot may prate what he has been in|&s;tructed in. That to examine into the
Truth of any Doctrine before we a&s;&s;ent to it, is our Duty; that implicit
Faith is a Mon&s;ter in its Nature, and worthy only of Papal Regions, where the
Mind is fet|tered and Credulity and Ignorance &s;talls at large.</P>
<P>MANY other Arguments were produced, in Support of the Opinions of
tho&s;e inge|nious Gentlemen, which it would be too tedious to enumerate; the
Re&s;ult, how|ever, of their Enquiries, and the Inferen|ces they drew from
their Propo&s;itions, <PB N="67" REF="77"> were, that Faith, of whatever Kind
or Nature &s;oever, was not in the lea&s;t meri|torious, and of con&s;equence
not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; &s;ince it depended only on the Formation of
our Minds, and their Capability of di&s;tingui&s;hing with Preci&s;ion and
Accuracy, the Nature of Things, which accordingly influenced us to reject or
admit, to believe or di&s;believe any Pro|po&s;ition or Doctrine which came
under the Examination of our Sen&s;es; and that an Infidel and a Chri&s;tian,
are alike accepta|ble to God, and u&s;eful Members of the Community.</P>
<P>I SHALL not give the Sub&s;tance of what was &s;aid on the other
Side of the Que&s;tion, for the greater Part of the Speakers were tho&s;e who
di&s;believed the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and tho&s;e who &s;poke in
its Defence, injured the Cau&s;e they &s;hould have &s;upported, and betrayed
the Fort they &s;hould have defended, by their feeble and ridiculous Arguments.
To re|fute, therefore, the Ob&s;ervations before made, would not be to record
the Proceed|ings of the Society, but to give my own Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="78"> ONE Ob&s;ervation I mu&s;t, however, be
permitted to make. An ignorant Chri&s;|tian that pretends to defend
Chri&s;tianity again&s;t the Attacks of Infidels, is the greate&s;t Enemy it
can have. The Shafts of Ridicule pointed again&s;t it by its Foes, are too
blunted, and the divine Shield of Truth, which Chri&s;tianity has to defend
her, is too &s;trong for any Impre&s;&s;ion to be made on it. It mu&s;t not be
concluded therefore, that if, in public Societies, Chri&s;tianity is not always
defended with a cool and intrepid Spirit, again&s;t the hot A&s;&s;aults of a
whole Legion of Adver&s;aries, that it is not defen&s;ible. Let but the
pre|tended Friends of Chri&s;tianity hold their Tongues, and it will defend
it&s;elf; but if they open the Gate to its Foes, it is no Wonder that they
&s;hould enter, and tri|umph without a Victory.</P>
<P>TO give the Reader as &s;atisfactory Ac|count of the Society as I
can, and to en|able him to form an adequate Idea of the Members that compo&s;ed
it, I &s;hall tran&s;|cribe a few of the Que&s;tions they debated, and give a
brief Hi&s;tory of a few of the principal Speakers.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="79"> SOME of the Que&s;tions that adorn the Book
of Debates, and called forth the Oratorial Abilities of the Members, are as
follow:</P>
<P> 
<LABEL>RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS.</LABEL> 
<Q>Whether the Ceremonies and Practice of Mankind, relative to
Marriage, under the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, were &s;uper|&s;eded, or &s;et
a&s;ide by the Chri&s;tian Revelation? 
<BIBL>JUDAEUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Character of the Man after <HI>GOD</HI>'s own Heart,
is proper for the Imitation of People in the&s;e Days? 
<BIBL>TITUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a Plurality of Wives, practi&s;ed by the fir&s;t Race of
Men, is not ju&s;ti|fiable by the pre&s;ent, as the Doctrine and Practice were
not abrogated by the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians? 
<BIBL>ANGLICANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Doctrine of the Trinity can be ju&s;tified either by
Rea&s;on or Scripture? 
<BIBL>ANTI-TRINITARIAN.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><PB N="70" REF="80">Whether a po&s;itive Command to believe in
Doctrines we have no Conception of, and cannot compel our Rea&s;on to &s;ub|mit
to, has not a manife&s;t Tendency to hoodwink our rational Faculties, and to
put us on a Level with Bea&s;ts, whom we command to perform our Wills without
giving them any Rea&s;ons for our &s;o doing? 
<BIBL>PHILO-LIBERTATIS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity are not irreconcileable
to the Rea&s;on, and repugnant to the Intere&s;ts of Mankind? 
<BIBL>DRACO.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Exerci&s;e of our rational Fa|culties, independent
of any &s;upernatural A&s;&s;i&s;tance, be not &s;ufficient to guide us to
Salvation? And if it is not a gro&s;s Affront to the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Great
Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary? 
<BIBL>BRITANNICUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether it is con&s;i&s;tent with the Common Sen&s;e of Mankind
to believe, that the Divine <HI>LOGOS,</HI> or <HI>Word,</HI> or <HI>Su|preme
Being,</HI> could be born of a Vir|gin? 
<BIBL>NEGATIVUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q><PB N="71" REF="81">Whether any one is accountable to any Body
of Men whatever for his religi|ous Sentiments? 
<BIBL>CHRISTIANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Variety of Religious Sy&s;tems, all pretending to
have the Divine Au|thority of the Sacred Writings for their Foundation, does
not warrant an un|prejudiced and a rational Per&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect the
Authenticity of tho&s;e Writings? Or, if not, to decline being a Member of any
vi&s;ible Church? 
<BIBL>CHUBB.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As the&s;e Que&s;tions are &s;ufficient to &s;hew into what
Extravagancies Men may be led by the <HI>Freedom of Enquiry,</HI> &s;ome,
though not expunged from the Book of Debates, are yet omitted here, as too
impious and bla&s;phemous to be repeated.</P>
<P> 
<LABEL>POLITICAL QUESTIONS.</LABEL> 
<Q>Whether the Power lodged in a Prime Mini&s;ter, be not too great
to be en|tru&s;ted with any Subject; and if, in <PB N="72" REF="82"> Time, it
will not &s;ap the very Vitals of our Con&s;titution? 
<BIBL>ARISTARCHUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether, if it can be undeniably proved, that a K&mdash; has
broke his Coronation Oath, the Subjects are not di&s;charged from their
Allegiance? 
<BIBL>DUBITOR.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a Monarch, who loads an unde|&s;erving Favourite with
Trea&s;ures, and who hears and &s;ees every thing with <HI>HIS</HI> Ears and
Eyes, merits the glorious Title of a Patriot King, notwith&s;tand|ing the
ful&s;ome Adulation and &s;ervile Compliments paid him by dependent Sy|cophants
and venal Authors? 
<BIBL>REPUBLICANUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the great Snow we had &s;ome time pa&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great Snow here alluded to happened in 1674, and continued
without Intermi&s;&s;ion eleven Days. Great Damages were occa&s;ioned thereby,
Huts and little Hou&s;es were intirely covered, the Current of our Rivers was
&s;topped, and Multitudes of People mi&s;erably peri&s;hed.</NOTE>, attended
with a &s;mart Fro&s;t, has not had a wonderful Effect in freez|ing 
<PB N="73" REF="83"> and congealing the Sen&s;es of &s;ome certain Mini&s;ters?

<BIBL>SARCASTICUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether a King, who, in a Speech he makes from his Throne,
&s;olemnly declares he will perform certain Actions which he never does
perform, a&s;&s;erts manife&s;t Fal&s;ehoods that are evident to the whole
Nation, and endeavours to make his Subjects believe that black is white, and
that two and two make five, is a bet|ter Monarch than <HI>Alfred</HI> or
<HI>Con&s;tan|tine?</HI> 
<BIBL>ANTONINUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the Smiles of a Monarch can purify the Heart of a
Game&s;ter, or the Bed of a Counte&s;s &s;anctify Lewdne&s;s and Adultery,
notwith&s;tanding both the <HI>UTOPIAN</HI> Monarch and Counte&s;s are bedawbed
over by venal Pens, and re|pre&s;ented as Pious, Good, Great, and every Thing
that is excellent? 
<BIBL>DUN SCOTUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether the notorious Practice of the Mi|ni&s;try's interfering
with the Election of Members of Parliament, and the Arts of Bribery and
Corruption, &s;o univer|&s;ally known to be made U&s;e of on tho&s;e 
<PB N="74" REF="84"> Occa&s;ions, do not reflect Di&s;honour on the &mdash;
that permits or connives at tho&s;e illegal Practices, which manife&s;tly tend
to de&s;troy the Freedom of the Sub|ject? 
<BIBL>MARCUS AURELIUS.</BIBL></Q> 
<Q>Whether triennial Parliaments would not be for the good of this
Nation? 
<BIBL>AUGUSTUS.</BIBL></Q> </P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Religious and Political Que&s;tions
debated by the Soci|ety, and from their Nature and Tendency the Reader is
enabled to judge of the re&s;t. He may ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e,
and the mo&s;t ea&s;y Subjects, are alike de|bated on; tho&s;e that the
greate&s;t human Faculties cannot reach, and tho&s;e that the verie&s;t
Blockhead can under&s;tand.</P>
<P>THE Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch Que&s;tions mu&s;t appear to every one.
What can be more ridiculous, than for a Society of Philo&s;o|phers and
Chri&s;tians to endeavour to explain My&s;teries, to fathom what is
unfathom|able, and to conceive what is inconcei|vable? Such is the Pride of
human Wit, and &s;uch our Delight in reconciling Para|doxes, and fighting with
Shadows, that we neglect the Study of Subjects that are of <PB N="75" REF="85">
the la&s;t Importance, and ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood, and employ our Thoughts
on tho&s;e that are out of the Reach of finite Capa|cities, and which, could
they be explained and under&s;tood, would cea&s;e to be my&s;te|rious; for, as
an eminent Divine has ju&s;t|ly ob&s;erved, a My&s;tery explained is a
Con|tradiction in Terms, &s;ince, being explained, it becomes no My&s;tery at
all.</P>
<P>NOR le&s;s ab&s;urd and ridiculous is the de|bating on Subjects
that can admit of no rational Debate, or the lea&s;t Doubt. Why &s;hould an
A&s;&s;embly of Men, who&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ed Intention is to improve one
ano|ther, propo&s;e a Que&s;ton, <HI>Whether Vice is Vice or not?</HI> For that
is the whole Pur|port of the &s;ixth Political Que&s;tion before &s;et down.
That Vice is intrin&s;ically Vice, in Subject or in King, can admit of no
Di&s;pute: No Power, no Rank, no For|tune can alter the E&s;&s;ence of Things,
however they may gild them over, and conceal their native Horror. As to the
other Que&s;tions, both Religious and Poli|tical, I forbear commenting on them:
But I mu&s;t needs ob&s;erve, that I think the fir&s;t are extremely indecent,
and the latter va&s;tly bold, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a public So|ciety; to
&s;ay nothing of the Application <PB N="76" REF="86"> that every one cannot
help making when attentively con&s;idering the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I COME now to perform the Promi&s;e I before made, of giving a
conci&s;e Account of a few of the principal Speakers in this illu&s;trious
Society: But as &s;ome of them are &s;till living, in&s;tead of their real
Names, I &s;hall characteri&s;e them under fictitious ones.</P>
<P>POMPONIUS ATTICUS was a young Gentleman of Genius and Judg|ment,
of a graceful Pre&s;ence, and ready Elocution. But Fancy frequently got the
better of &s;ober Reflection, and hurried him into Incon&s;i&s;tencies and
Paradoxes, which all his Wit and Learning could not &s;upport. He was,
according to the recei|ved Meaning of the Word, a Dei&s;t; but, according to a
true Expre&s;&s;ion of that Cha|racter, an Unbeliever of the Truth of the
Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Divinity of its Author. He had an E&s;tate left
him by his decea&s;ed Father, of &s;even hundred a Year, which he had mortgaged
to almo&s;t its full Value at different Times, and di&s;&s;ipated the Produce
in the Pur&s;uit of fa&s;hionable Vices and Follies; &s;o that, at the Age of
twenty-&s;even, when he fir&s;t became a <PB N="77" REF="87"> Member of the
<HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head Society,</HI> an Annuity for Life of &s;ixty Pounds only
re|mained. A loo&s;e and di&s;orderly Life gene|rally brings on &s;ome Rebukes
of Con&s;ci|ence, and &s;ome alarming Reflections. To prevent their Influence,
returning Appe|tite and &s;trong Temptation pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, and
enli&s;ting the Will under their Banners, Rea&s;on is &s;educed, and
Con&s;ci|ence &s;mothered. But, as under the mo&s;t mountainous Oppre&s;&s;ion,
the&s;e rigid Mo|nitors will call &s;orth, with a loud Voice, and bid their
Ma&s;ter beware of the gilded Poi&s;on that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to his View,
and da&s;h the unble&s;&s;ed Cup from his de&s;iring Lips; &s;o, POMPONIUS
feeling the dread|ful Con&s;equences of Vice, and attending to the Monitors
within, re&s;olved to reform his Life, and to for&s;ake the Companions of his
Wickedne&s;s. But this Re&s;olution was but tran&s;itory: The fir&s;t fine
Woman he &s;aw di&s;armed him, and he fell from his Heroi&s;m. A Continuance in
Wickedne&s;s debilitates the Faculties, and urges us to defend what we
practi&s;e. In&s;tead, there|fore, of leaving off the Practice of Vice,
POMPONIUS began to extenuate it&mdash;to ju&s;tify it&mdash;and to admire it.
He now commenced a philo&s;ophic Rake, defended his Actions by Figures of
Speech, and ha|rangued <PB N="78" REF="88"> on the Expediency and Utility of
Fornication, with the choice&s;t Metaphors. He was now &s;urpri&s;ed at his
former Pu&s;il|lanimity and Doubt; and was clearly of Opinion, that the
Practice of Whoredom was ju&s;tifiable by Rea&s;on, that great Lord Chief
Ju&s;tice in the Court of Man, and tended greatly to the Support of the
Com|mon-Wealth. The Tran&s;ition of this State of Mind, into a perfect
Compo&s;ure and Serenity in the Practice of Vice, is very quick. Before we have
deviated from the Path of Duty, indeed, Con&s;ci|ence, that ill-natured
Snarler, that Enemy to our Happine&s;s, &s;ugge&s;ts a thou&s;and Rea|&s;ons
for our Continuance in the &s;ame Road, and pretends to a&s;&s;ert, that the
plea&s;ant Views, and delightful Pro&s;pects we &s;ee on each Side of us, are
unreal, and a mere Moc|kery of the Sen&s;es; and warns us, with an an earne&s;t
and a loud Voice, not to for|&s;ake the Road we are in, to gra&s;p at Sha|dows,
or to catch Butterflies. Nobly di&s;daining to be controuled by &s;o rigid a
Monitor, we quit the Path in which we &s;afely trod, and turn towards the
Bowers of Bli&s;s, and Beds of Ro&s;es, where Sy|rens &s;olicit our Approach,
and urge us to recreate our jaded Sen&s;es, and refre&s;h our tired Limbs. We
comply with the kind <PB N="79" REF="89"> Invitation: We are lulled to re&s;t
by the &s;oft Melody of en&s;naring Voices: We en|ter the Bowers of Bli&s;s; we
throw our|&s;elves on the Beds of Ro&s;es, fully per&s;ua|ded we &s;hall there
be happy&mdash;But, ah! what Horror invades us, when we find Harpies and Furies
are the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Bowers, and that Adders, and Vi|pers, and
Scorpions, lurk beneath the Ro&s;e Beds!</P>
<P>So was it with POMPONIUS. But of the latter Pa t of this
De&s;cription he ex|perienced not the Truth, 'till Conviction came to him on a
Death-Bed&mdash;Fre|quenting the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head Society,</HI> he was
con&s;idered by all as a fine Speaker, and clo&s;e Rea&s;oner. No Chri&s;tian
dared enter the Li&s;ts with our Unbeliever; but if, ra&s;h and impetuous, by
Chance any one at|tempted it, he was &s;ure of being foiled.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he went on 'till he ar|rived at the Age of Forty,
happy in his Vices, and perfectly convinced of their Innocence. His dei&s;tical
Notions were confirmed by the Authority of many Writers of the fir&s;t Note,
and many Speakers of the &s;ame Sentiments, that attended the Society; and they
encouraged <PB N="80" REF="90"> each other in them, and from Time to Time
entertained the World with their Productions, in Order, as them&s;elves
ob|&s;erved, that the Cau&s;e of Truth &s;hould be propagated, and Bigotry and
Super&s;tition be bani&s;hed from the World.</P>
<P>A MELANCHOLY Sequel remains to complete the Story. Shall I relate,
or leave the Imagination to gue&s;s at the Power of Sickne&s;s, and the
Pro&s;pect of Death?&mdash;No; there is no Occa&s;ion. Suffice it to &s;ay,
that the witty, the face|tious, the learned POMPONIUS, retracted the Opinions
he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and declared that he <HI>felt</HI> Chri&s;tianity was no
empty Name, no Juggle or Trick put upon Mankind by artful Prie&s;ts, to fetter
Rea|&s;on, and impo&s;e on the Sen&s;es, but a &s;ub|&s;tantial Good, which its
Profe&s;&s;ors may po&s;&s;e&s;s, but of which he could entertain no Idea, but
from the De&s;pair and Horror he felt from the Want of it.&mdash;The&s;e Things
he now declared; but <HI>where</HI> de|clared them? Alas! on a Bed from whence
he never more aro&s;e into this World: His immortal Spirit freed from its
Impri&s;on|ment in the Body, entered the Regions of Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="91"> A VERY different Kind of Being was that
who&s;e Hi&s;tory I &s;hall now give. GRIPUS was born of very mean and poor
Parents at <HI>Shiffnall</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> who, with great
Difficulty, brought him up to a Knowledge of Reading and Writing. At the Age of
thirteen, he was put Ap|prentice to a Peruke-maker, and on his Arrival to his
twenty-&s;econd Year, with eleven Shillings and nine Pence only, he &s;et out
for <HI>London.</HI> On his coming to this great City, and examining into the
State of his Finances, he found he had one Shilling and three Pence Hal&s;penny
left. With that Sum he determined to try his Fortune, and looked out for a
Place in the Capacity of a Journeyman Barber. His Endeavours were crown'd with
Succe&s;s: He found a Place, and he was happy. Nine Months he continued here,
and &s;aved up the Sum of &s;even Pounds nine Shillings. It was a Fortune to
him, and he re&s;olv'd to improve it; but not in the Bu&s;ine&s;s he was bred
to, for he found it would not an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e. With &s;even Pounds and
nine Shillings only, GRIPUS enter'd <HI>the Alley,</HI> and took on him a
Bu&s;ine&s;s he knew nothing of; but he had heard that &s;mall Sums had
pro|duced <PB N="82" REF="92"> immen&s;e Fortunes in it. He was ignorant and
illiterate to the la&s;t Degree; had no Accompli&s;hments that could re|commend
him to the Notice of the World, or re&s;cue him, according to all Probability,
from that low and mean State he had been bred in, and was then &s;ubject
to.</P>
<P>AS Fortune is hoodwink'd, and re|gardle&s;s of the Merits of her
Suitors, it frequently happens, that the Unworthy are admitted into her Temple,
and re|ceiv'd as her peculiar Favourites, while the Learned and Ingenious
langui&s;h in Ob|&s;curity, or drag a heavy, galling Chain, condemn'd to Penury
and Want. GRIPUS experienced the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation. With not a
&s;ingle Qualification that could intitle him to the Regard of any one, or
re&s;cue him from the &s;ervile and ignomi|nious State he had been u&s;ed to,
he met with great Succe&s;s, and abounded in Af|fluence; Wealth flow'd in
fa&s;t upon him, while Men of infinitely greater Merit were &s;inking beneath a
Load of Misfor|tunes, and patiently enduring the Frowns of Fortune. The
<HI>Alley</HI> prov'd a real Friend to him, and his Sub&s;tance conti|nually
increa&s;ed. As he grew more weal|thy, he was more par&s;imonious; and he 
<PB N="83" REF="93"> &s;eldom or never &s;pent more than three Half-pence for
his Breakfa&s;t, three Pence Half-penny for his Dinner, and three Half-pence
for a Nipperkin of home|brewed, either at the Crooked Billet in <HI>Shire
Lane,</HI> or the Welch Harp in <HI>Full|wood's Rents.</HI></P>
<P>IN about twenty Years he had ama&s;&s;ed together the Sum of
Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds, with the greate&s;t Part of which he purcha&s;ed an
E&s;tate in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and laid out the Remainder in the Stocks.
His Sub&s;tance, like a Snow-ball, was conti|nually increa&s;ing, and with it
the De&s;ire of more. Like the Grave, his Lu&s;t for Money was boundle&s;s, and
he endea|vour'd to obtain it by all the Means in his Power.</P>
<P>ON his Arrival to his forty-&s;eventh Year, Curio&s;ity brought
him to the <HI>E&s;&s;ex Head,</HI> and Avarice kept him there. Six-pence a
Night was, indeed, more than he had made it a Rule to &s;pend; but for that
Six-pence he might drink a Gallon or two of good Porter, and on the Days he
went there, he took Care to drink none any where el&s;e; &s;o that he ju&s;tly 
<PB N="84" REF="94"> con&s;ider'd, that if he drank but three full Pots, he was
Three-pence Gainer.</P>
<P>IT can &s;carcely be expected that &s;uch a <HI>Genius</HI> as I
am de&s;cribing, could be an Orator; but he was as good a Drinker as any of
them, and though he could neither &s;peak to a Que&s;tion, or comprehend the
Force of any Argument, yet while the Debates were held, he could amu&s;e
him|&s;elf with his Tankard, and &s;moke his Pipe; and after they were
fini&s;hed, could for two or three Hours longer, &s;moke his Pipe, and amu&s;e
him&s;elf with his Tan|kard&mdash;and all for Six-pence.</P>
<P>IN this Manner old GRIPUS went on 'till the la&s;t Day of his
Life, the Je&s;t of Fools, the Contempt of Coxcombs, the Pity of Men of
Sen&s;e, and the Dete&s;tation of his Relations; though, indeed, the&s;e latter
being needy, paid him &s;ome Court, and &s;hewed him &s;ome Re&s;pect, which
his Wealth, not his Merit, extorted; mere 
<Q REND="inline">"Mouth-Honour, which the poor Heart would fain
have denied."</Q></P>
<P>GRIPUS had many Relations, who &s;tood in Need of his Bounty; but,
in&s;en|&s;ible <PB N="85" REF="95"> to every Thing but the Lu&s;t of Mo|ney,
dead to all the &s;ocial Feelings of the Soul, he cared not a Straw if his
Kindred and all Mankind were at the Bottom of the Sea, &s;o that he could
&s;tand &s;afely on Land, &s;urvey the Scene, and, like a <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>
or <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Savage, pillage the Wreck.</P>
<P>A LENGTH of Years, however, weigh'd him down at las;t, and he fell
ill. Death was written in his Face, and he was pro|nounced incurable. The
Landlord, in who&s;e Hou&s;e he had for many Years lodged by Way of
Cheapne&s;s, had Two Hundred Pounds in his Hands belonging to GRIPUS; and this
Sum, he determin'd, by &s;ome Artifice, to appropriate to his own U&s;e. How
this was to be obtain'd, was the grand Que&s;tion, and well worthy the
Contriver's Genius. WILL was no le&s;s a Mi&s;er than GRIPUS, and had, by
keeping a mean, beggarly Coffee-Hou&s;e, in a dirty Lane, &s;aved up Three or
Four Thou&s;and Pounds; but he con&s;ider'd, that Two Hundred would be a good
Ad|dition to it. The Scheme being at length duly adju&s;ted, WILL made his
Appear|ance before GRIPUS, attended by two Witne&s;&s;es, who were to &s;tand
concealed, hear the Di&s;cour&s;e, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, give 
<PB N="86" REF="96"> in Evidence of it. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have Two Hun|dred Pounds of yours in my Hands,
Mr. GRIPUS, &s;aid WILL, and I want to know what I mu&s;t do with it."</Q>
GRIPUS, rack'd with Pain, and &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of any Thing, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Keep it your&s;elf."</Q> A Wink of the Eye, and a
Projection of the Hand, now were nece&s;&s;ary, to bring the two Witne&s;&s;es
forward. They came. 
<Q REND="inline">"What mu&s;t I do with the Two Hundred Pounds, Mr.
GRIPUS? As you are now, in all Pro|bability, on a Death-bed, it is be&s;t to
&s;ettle the&s;e Affairs."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"You may keep it your&s;elf, an&s;wer'd the &s;ick
Man."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Then you give and be&s;tow the Two Hundred Pounds
on me, don't you?"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I do, reply'd he."</Q> This was &s;ufficient.
WILL ha&s;ten'd down Stairs, had an Affidavit drawn of the Legacy given him,
and in a &s;hort Time after GRIPUS expired; That GRIPUS who lived de&s;pi&s;ed
and hated, and died unlamented.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Member of the Society, was Father MURTAGH O'FLAHERTY, a
Popi&s;h Prie&s;t. <HI>Ireland</HI> gave him Birth, St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s
Education, and <HI>England</HI> a good Income. He had for a long Time, 
<PB N="87" REF="97"> after his Return from St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s, re&s;ided in
the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was look'd on as a very learned and able
Divine. The Aged revered him for his Judgment; and the Youthful for his gay and
lively Di&s;po|&s;ition, freed from the Au&s;terity and Ri|gour that frequently
make Wi&s;dom odious. MURTAGH would demon&s;trate with the greate&s;t
Clearne&s;s, that Mirth and Chear|fulne&s;s were not in the lea&s;t
incon&s;i&s;tent with Religion; that a Bottle of good Claret fortified the
Body, and rai&s;ed the Spirits; and that the Joys which a good Tavern and boon
Companions afford, were not to be de&s;pi&s;ed by Men of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of this natural Propen|&s;ity, this longing
De&s;ire to be happy, and to make others &s;o, Father MURTAGH would frequent
Clubs, and &s;ing Catches, &s;peak Speeches, drink Toa&s;ts, break
Gla&s;|&s;es, and tell merry Stories, with any one: And though &s;ome rigid
Prie&s;ts, and &s;evere Morali&s;ts, would cen&s;ure him behind his Back for
his immoral Conduct, as they term'd it, yet, when he appear'd before them, he
had &s;uch a pretty Way, &s;uch a forcible Method of vindicating his
Beha|viour, and winning their Affections, that <PB N="88" REF="98"> they could
not find in their Hearts to blame him.</P>
<P>BUT, with &s;uch Accompli&s;hments, if he was a Favourite of the
Men, what mu&s;t he be with the Women? They per|fectly idolized him, and, in
Return, Fa|ther MURTAGH had no le&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion and Veneration for them.
Indeed, there was another Circum&s;tance, which, though it may be deem'd a
Trifle by &s;ome Folks, had a wonderful Effect in forcing the Af|fections of
the Fair. As he acted in the Character of a Confe&s;&s;or, to rivet the
E&s;teem of his Penitents, he u&s;ed Lenity in&s;tead of Severity, and in
Ca&s;es where &s;ome Confe&s;&s;ors would have &s;courged with a Rod of Iron,
he rebuked with the Mildne&s;s of a Father, and exhorted them to a contrary
Conduct, if they would avoid his ju&s;t Indignation. The&s;e lenient and gentle
Methods prevail'd where rough and violent ones would not. The human Mind is
rather won by Entreaty, than dragged by Force, and receives Conviction from a
Friend that &s;oothes its Angui&s;h, and makes Allowance for its Frailties;
when, by a contrary Conduct, venial Er|ror might ri&s;e to Guilt, and youthful
In|dulgence <PB N="89" REF="99"> terminate in confirmed Wicked|ne&s;s and
ob&s;tinate Villainy.</P>
<P>FATHER MURTAGH being &s;uch a pro|fe&s;&s;ed Admirer of the Fair,
and treating them with &s;uch Mildne&s;s, he had &s;o won their Hearts, that
they re&s;ounded his Prai&s;es continually. They in&s;i&s;ted on it, he was the
be&s;t Prie&s;t in the Kingdom, the mo&s;t learned and judicious Man, and
infinitely the be&s;t qualified to be a Confe&s;|&s;or. In &s;hort, they would
confe&s;s to no one but Father MURTAGH. Father MURTAGH was the univer&s;al
Cry.</P>
<P>THIS Trade continued &s;o long, that a Con&s;piracy was formed by
his envious Bre|thren again&s;t his Monopoly, and by Force of Bribes and
Numbers, he fell a Victim to popular Wrath, and prie&s;tly Artifice.</P>
<P>FOR a long Time the good Man, poor and friendle&s;s, wandered
about, a melan|choly Proof of the unhappy Fate that may attend Men of the
greate&s;t Parts, and of the Want of Gratitude for pa&s;t Favours, when the
Power of continuing them is taken away.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="100"> FINDING he could &s;carcely &s;upport
him|&s;elf in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he came to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;oon formed
an Acquaintance with many People of his own Religion. An <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Roman
Catholick Prie&s;t need never fear wanting a Beef-Steak and a Pot of Porter for
his Dinner in <HI>London:</HI> Nay, he need not fear wanting Veni&s;on or
Ortolans, and good Claret. There are Abundance of Papi&s;ts in this City, who
regard their Prie&s;ts as &s;o many Demi-Gods, and who will think them&s;elves
as highly honoured with their Pre&s;ence at Dinner or Supper, as BAUCIS and
PHILEMON thought them|&s;elves by the Pre&s;ence of their heavenly Gue&s;t; and
in con&s;equence of this Opi|nion, the Markets are ran&s;acked for the
choice&s;t Viands, and the Wine Vaults for the be&s;t Wines, to entertain them.
As &s;tolen Interviews between Lovers are the &s;weete&s;t, &s;o the
Nece&s;&s;ity the Roman Ca|tholic Clergy are under to keep them&s;elves
concealed, in order to gain Pro&s;elytes, and pervert the People to their
Religion, give a Reli&s;h to their Entertainments which they would otherwi&s;e
want.</P>
<P>FATHER MURTAGH &s;oon &s;aved up a good deal of Money, and lived
as elegantly <PB N="91" REF="101"> as his Heart could wi&s;h. He attended
eve|ry <HI>Monday</HI> night at the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head,</HI> &s;poke to the
Que&s;tions in the Character of a Pro|te&s;tant, yet could not help betraying
the cloven Foot on &s;ome Occa&s;ions. After the Debates of the Evening were
over, and the Company entered into private Conferences with each other, Father
<HI>Murtagh</HI> would &s;ingle out that Per&s;on whom he conceived mo&s;t fit
for his Purpo&s;e, and u&s;e the greate&s;t Indu&s;try and exert all his
Abilities, to de|preciate the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of this Kingdom, and
extol that of the Roman Catholic, and his Endeavours were often
&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>HE is now very old, and having for many Years attended at the
<HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head Society,</HI> he comes to the <HI>Robinhood;</HI> but not
con|&s;tantly, on Account of his Age and Infir|mities.</P>
<P>BOB SCAMPER was a Man very different from the three I have been
de|&s;cribing: BOB was born in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and was reckoned
a Youth of enterpri&s;ing Genius, and ready Parts. At the Age of eighteen he
came to <HI>London,</HI> and having &s;pent the five Guineas he brought up with
him on Women of the Town, <PB N="92" REF="102"> was greatly at a Lo&s;s to what
to betake him&s;elf. Poverty &s;tared him in the Face, and tho' he had &s;ome
good natural Parts, and a great A&s;&s;urance, yet having no Learn|ing, he
could get no genteel Employment. His Female a&s;&s;ociates, however, &s;oon
fur|ni&s;hed Hints, which a Lad of his ready Wit and enterpri&s;ing Spirit,
ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and as intrepidly executed. He turned Collector on the
Road, and having Suc|ce&s;s, rioted in the Spoils he had taken, and with his
Girls enjoyed all the Happine&s;s he de&s;ired: Not but that &s;ometimes it was
da&s;hed with &s;ome Remor&s;e, and the Dread of the fatal Con&s;equences that
might en&s;ue. But Exce&s;s of drinking, the Company of Libertines, and the
Conver&s;ation of his Women, di&s;per&s;ed the Clouds that ob&s;cured his
Happine&s;s, and confirmed him in the Re&s;olution he had taken to plunder and
rob the Public, and to gain a Livelihood by the bold Hands of Violence.</P>
<P>A CONTINUANCE in Wickedne&s;s fa|miliari&s;es the Mind to it, and
what at fir&s;t a Man would &s;tart even to think of, he at length practi&s;es
without Horror. All Guilt is progre&s;&s;ive: We go not at once, but Step by
Step, into the Extremes of Vice; and tho' it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ilence the
Cries <PB N="93" REF="103"> of Con&s;cience, and to &s;tifle the Dictates of
Rea&s;on all at once, yet an habitual Viola|tion of their Admonitions, brings
us to an In&s;en&s;ibility of the Horror of our Crimes, and renders us quite
callous to the Sen&s;e of Shame, and deaf to every Thing but the importunate
Cravings of &s;en&s;ual Appetite.</P>
<P>BOB SCAMPER experienced the Truth of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations. In
the Day-Time he mounted his Hor&s;e, and robbed on the Highway with the &s;ame
Compo&s;ure, as any other Man follows <HI>his</HI> cu&s;tomary Occupation, and
at Night he &s;pent the ill|got Trea&s;ure among Whores and Thieves, the
Encouragers of his Wickedne&s;s, and the Sharers of his Spoils.</P>
<P>THIS was a worthy Member of a So|ciety that met to improve
them&s;elves by free and candid Inquiry; but Captain SCAMPER, as he was
intitled, was well received by all. He was a tall hand&s;ome Fellow, endued
with a Power of Face that di&s;dained a Blu&s;h, and though not wi&s;e was
witty, though not learned was ingeni|ous, and had a Power of impo&s;ing on the
Under&s;tandings of tho&s;e he conver&s;ed with, and making them believe him to
be what he was not. He dre&s;&s;ed well, had a free <PB N="94" REF="104"> and
<HI>degag&eacute;e</HI> Air, wanted not Words, and addre&s;&s;ed the
Pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e he conver&s;ed with, with &s;uch Skill and Succe&s;s,
that you could not help giving him Credit for much more Under&s;tanding than he
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE are two Kinds of People that are better thought of in mo&s;t
Companies, than their intrin&s;ic Merit de&s;erves: The&s;e are the &s;olemn
Prig, and well-dre&s;&s;ed Cox|comb. The fir&s;t, by the Help of a full|trimmed
grave Suit, and a large Peruque, a &s;agacious Look, and a &s;low Deli|very,
&s;hall make you take him for a &s;econd SOLON. The mo&s;t unmeaning Speech,
the trite&s;t Ob&s;ervation, the mo&s;t &s;uperficial Hint, delivered in a dry,
yet important, &s;low but &s;olemn Tone, and enforced by &s;ome &s;hakes of the
Head, &s;hrugs of the Shoulders, and &s;ignificant Hand-Oratory, &s;hall be
received as the Dictates of Wi&s;dom, and procure the Speaker the Character of
the SOLOMON of the Age.</P>
<P>THE other, aided by his Taylor, Mil|lener, and Barber, tho' he
gives Vent to the Fulne&s;s of his Soul only by dry Jokes, and in&s;ipid
Remarks, is yet li&s;tened to with <PB N="95" REF="105"> Attention, and heard
with Plea&s;ure. No one will dare to contradict the A&s;&s;ertions of a Wit,
with laced Cloaths, Bag-Wig, and a Sword; and thus Folly is received for
Wi&s;dom, and vivacious Impudence for Ge|nius.</P>
<P>SCAMPER was to be ranked in this &s;econd Cla&s;s of Orators. He
&s;poke to eve|ry Que&s;tion, and tho' what he &s;aid had no great Depth or
much Meaning in it, yet being delivered from the Mouth of a Man that was
extremely well dre&s;&s;ed, and with no bad Accent or ill Grace, it was always
well received, and the Speaker was con|&s;idered as a very great
<HI>Genius,</HI> and an Or|nament to the Society.</P>
<P>BUT this Ornament of the Society did not la&s;t above five Years
and a Half. He had committed a Robbery on <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath,</HI> and taken
a Booty of no le&s;s than three Hundred Guineas. The Gentle|man he had robbed,
happened accidentally to come to the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head</HI> one
<HI>Monday</HI> Evening, and the Moment he entered the Room, Captain SCAMPER
had got up to &s;peak to the Que&s;tion. The Que&s;tion was</P>
<Q><PB N="96" REF="106"> Whether the Doctrine of Repentance taught by
the Chri&s;tian Religion, has not a manife&s;t Tendency to encourage
Wickedne&s;s? 
<BIBL>DEISTICUS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>SCAMPER, after de&s;iring the Pre&s;i|dent to read the Que&s;tion
again, &s;poke to it in the be&s;t Manner he could. He vindi|cated
Chri&s;tianity in general, and demon|&s;trated that all its Doctrines tended to
the Support of Morality, by di&s;countenancing all Manner of Vice. He &s;hewed
its &s;u|perior Excellency over all the Religions that had ever appeared in the
World; he proved the Authenticity of the Sacred Writings, and defied the
Dei&s;ts, with all their Ingenuity, to point out any Defects in them. He
ob&s;erved of our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, that as it compre|hended in
one conci&s;e View, all the Doc|trines and Precepts of Chri&s;tiany, &s;o it
was the mo&s;t &s;ublime Sy&s;tem of Ethics in the World. He took Notice, that
not only the Philo&s;ophers and Sages of the Heathen World, con&s;idered
ab&s;tractedly, were un|able to form a complete Sy&s;tem of moral Duties, but
that all their Writings put to|gether were in&s;ufficient to form &s;uch a
Sy&s;tem, and that if all their Morality was <PB N="97" REF="107"> to be
extracted, that is, all their Excellen|cies to be reduced into a Sy&s;tem, it
would &s;till be an imperfect one. He then &s;poke more immediately to the
Que&s;tion, and deli|vered it as his Opinion, that the Doctrine of Repentance,
as taught by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, of which, he &s;aid, he was not
a|&s;hamed to own him&s;elf a Member, &s;o far from encouraging Wickedne&s;s,
had the greate&s;t Tendency imaginable to annihilate it; for he ob&s;erved,
that the Repentance taught in the Go&s;pel, is not merely a Sor|row for our
pa&s;t Sins, but likewi&s;e a Re&s;o|lution of reforming our Conduct for the
fu|ture. As to the Objection that had been brought by a Dei&s;t, who
ob&s;erved, that Repentance was no Atonement, he &s;aid, it was very true, if
we &s;peak as Dei&s;ts, but if we believe as Chri&s;tians, it mu&s;t be looked
on as an Atonement, &s;ince GOD, in tho&s;e Books which Chri&s;tians believe
were writ|ten by his In&s;piration, has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to declare,
he will receive it as &s;uch. Our Duty he ob&s;erved, without Doubt, it was
always incumbent on us to practi&s;e; and after the Commi&s;&s;ion of the
greate&s;t Sins, and our &s;incere Repentance of them, we perform no more than
our Duty, by living a Righteous and a Holy Life: But as the Deity had declared
to <PB N="98" REF="108"> every one, even the greate&s;t of Sinners, that though
his Crimes were as red as Scarlet, yet by Repentance the &s;hould be made as
white as Snow; it is certainly a Doctrine that encourages the Soul, and
&s;upports it under the Reproaches of Con&s;cience, that would otherwi&s;e whip
us with her Scor|pions, and throw us into the Agonies of De&s;pair and Horror.
He concluded, by drawing a Contra&s;t between the Repen|tance of the
Prote&s;tant, and the Ab&s;olution of the Roman Catholic Church; and
in|&s;i&s;ted, that the former tended to our &s;pi|ritual and temporal Welfare,
and the latter to the De&s;truction of both.</P>
<P>DURING all the Time this great Advo|cate for Religion and Morality
was &s;peak|ing, the Gentleman eyed him attentively, and thought he had &s;een
him &s;omewhere before. He went up clo&s;e to him, and after a minute
examination of his Per&s;on and Manner, at length recollected that it was on
<HI>Houn&s;low-Heath</HI> he had the Mi&s;|fortune to have &s;een him. Without
&s;aying any Thing to him, or to the Company, he withdrew, and in about a
Quarter of an Hour returned with his Servant, who was pre&s;ent at the Robbery,
and with a Con|&s;table, who was to take Care of SCAM|PER, <PB N="99" REF="109"> if the Servant agreed with his Ma&s;ter in the Identity of the
Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Servant had no &s;ooner entered the Room, than, without his
Ma&s;ter's pointing the Object out, he &s;wore that the tall Gen|tleman in
laced Cloaths, near the Pre&s;i|dent, was the Man that robbed his Ma&s;ter on
<HI>Houn&s;low-Heath.</HI> This was &s;ufficient. The Con&s;table went up to
him, and tap|ping him on the Shoulder, &s;aid, he &s;hould be glad to &s;peak
to him. The Captain obeyed, and they withdrew out of the Di&s;puting-Room,
attended by the Gentle|man and his Servant. They had no &s;ooner reached the
Stairs, than SCAMPER wanted to know the Gentleman's Commands. 
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, &s;ays the Con&s;table, there is a Coach
waiting at the Door, and if you'll enter it, you'll know pre&s;ently."</Q>
SCAMPER declin'd it, but the Con&s;table was importunate, and being &s;omewhat
irritated at his Ob&s;tinacy, told him he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> enter it. The Captain
&s;tared, bit his Lips, and was mute. The Gentleman and his Servant now came
up, and the latter opening the Coach-Door, waited for his Ma&s;ter to enter.
But he was too complai&s;ant to go in before the Captain, and bowing to him,
a&s;ked him to go in <PB N="100" REF="110"> fir&s;t. The Captain &s;till
declin'd it, and they in&s;i&s;ted on it in a higher Tone, and declar'd that he
&s;hould go whether he would or not. Already was half the Captain's Sword out
of the Scabbard, and he had re&s;olv'd to re&s;i&s;t their utmo&s;t Efforts,
when a Whi&s;tle from the Con&s;table made him &s;tare, and of a Sudden
&s;u&s;pend his Action. Immediately three &s;trapping Fel|lows came up, and the
Con&s;table pointing to SCAMPER, and telling them to do their Duty, they took
away his Sword, hurried him into the Coach, the Gentleman, his Servant, and the
Con&s;table following, and drove off to Ju&s;tice DE VEIL'S.</P>
<P>I SHALL not multiply Words. The Gentleman and his Servant &s;wore
po&s;itively that he was the Per&s;on that robb'd them on <HI>Houn&s;low
Heath.</HI> He was &s;earch'd. A Powder Horn, a Pair of Pi&s;tols, a Ma&s;k,
and &s;ome other Things were found on him. His Mittimus was made, and he was
&s;ent to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Fortnight, Abundance of People &s;wore to their being robb'd
by him; and by means of &s;ome of his Girls, three of his Confederates were
taken, and &s;ent to bear him Company. In due Time, their Trials 
<PB N="101" REF="111"> came on at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> and they were found
guilty, and &s;entenced to be hang'd.</P>
<P>SCAMPER had very little Hopes of gaining a Reprieve, yet did not
prepare for Death in the Manner he ought. His favourite Doctrine, Repentance,
he hardly thought of, at lea&s;t he did not practi&s;e it. He drank to &s;uch
Exce&s;s, that when the Hour came that he was to &s;uffer an igno|minious Death
in the Sight of a nume|rous and gaping Populace, he &s;eem'd quite
in&s;en&s;ible of his Fate.</P>
<P>HE was put into the Cart with his Companions, and they were driven
to <HI>Tyburn.</HI> The fatal Rope was fa&s;ten'd round their Necks&mdash;the
Ordinary told them they were going to another World&mdash;the Cart was driven
away&mdash;and they were left &s;u&s;pended in the Air.</P>
<P>THUS peri&s;h'd BOB SCAMPER, a Man of no mean Abilities, but who
pro&s;tituted them to infamous Purpo&s;es, and lived an immoral, vicious Life,
though ever ha|ranguing in the Society, on the Beauty of Holine&s;s, and the
Nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance.&mdash;I wi&s;h this were not a common Ca&s;e in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112"> ANOTHER Member of the Society, not le&s;s
worthy than this, was TOM RAKE|WELL. TOM, after having receiv'd an Education,
that barely enabled him to read and write, was &s;ent from the We&s;t of
<HI>England</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and there bound Ap|prentice to a Grocer.
But TOM'S Genius was not to be confin'd within &s;o narrow a Channel. He
&s;oared to higher Things, and was ambitious enough to attempt get|ting on the
Stage, where all his De&s;ires were placed, and all his Hopes terminated. He
offer'd him&s;elf to FLEETWOOD, the Manager, and was refu&s;ed. Not daunted,
however, at this Repul&s;e, he ran away from his Ma&s;ter in the third Year of
his Apprentice&s;hip, went to <HI>Norwich,</HI> where a Company of Strollers
were then per|forming, made a Tender of his Services, and was accepted. The
pitiful Income of a &s;trolling Player was too &s;canty for our Hero, and the
Debts he had contracted were &s;o numerous, and his Creditors &s;o
pre&s;&s;ing, that <HI>Norwich</HI> became quickly too hot to hold him. He,
therefore, &s;et out from that Place for <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne,</HI> where
there was another Company of Players: But, to enable him&s;elf to travel with
greater Conveniency, he took with <PB N="103" REF="113"> him as large a Bundle
of the Manager's Cloaths as he could carry, and &s;et out early in the Morning
in a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e.</P>
<P>HE quickly converted his Effects into ready Money, and reach'd
<HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in two Days. But he was &s;oon forced to decamp. The News
of his being there, having reached his <HI>quondam</HI> Companions at
<HI>Norwich,</HI> a Hue and Cry was rai&s;ed, and two of the Actors were &s;ent
to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to apprehend him. RAKEWELL, by &s;ome Means, had
Intelligence of their Arrival, and gue&s;&s;ed their Errand; but declin'd the
Honour of their Company, by leaving the Town &s;o precipitately, that he had
not even Time to pay the Landlord of the Inn he had &s;et up at, a Score of
thirty-&s;even &s;hillings.</P>
<P>FROM hence he went to <HI>Exeter,</HI> at which Town he was born;
and going to his Father, told him a long Story of his Ma&s;ter's ill U&s;age,
and of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of his living with him. His Father pro|duced a
Letter from his Ma&s;ter, informing him of his Son's running away without any
Cau&s;e, but of his Readine&s;s to pardon him if he would return. The Father
and Son had now a great Conte&s;t, and the Ma&s;ter's <PB N="104" REF="114">
Letter had greater Weight with the old Man, than the Son's A&s;&s;ertions. He,
however, promi&s;ed RAKEWELL, that he would write to his Ma&s;ter in his
Favour, and that 'till he could receive an An&s;wer, he might &s;tay with him.
The Son ac|quie&s;ced with the Propo&s;al, &s;eem'd plea&s;ed with it, and the
old Man immediately wrote, extenuating his Son's Guilt, and apologizing for the
Mi&s;conduct which the Weakne&s;s incident to Youth had drawn him into.</P>
<P>THREE Days after, TOM got up at One in the Morning, and opening a
Bu|reau, found a Pur&s;e with no le&s;s than fifty-&s;even Guineas in it, being
the poor old Man's whole Fortune, and which he had been hoarding up ever
&s;ince his Son was fir&s;t &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> out of the &s;mall
Profits that accrued to him from a little Trade he had as a Peruke-maker. This
was a Fortune to the over-joyed Youth, and putting it &s;afe in his Pocket, he
took his Stick, and walk'd 'till Seven in the Morning very bri&s;kly, when he
had reach'd ****. Here he breakfa&s;ted, and the Stage-Coach coming by, he
agreed with the Driver for his Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="115"> HE had no &s;ooner arriv'd at the
Metro|polis, than the Scenes he had before been engag'd in, were renew'd, and
the &s;ame Pranks play'd over again. While he was in his Apprentice&s;hip, an
indulgent Ma&s;ter had permitted him, after the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Night was
over, and Shop was &s;hut, to &s;pend his Evenings abroad. A Youth of &s;uch a
Di&s;po&s;ition as TOM had, it may naturally be imagin'd, did not &s;pend them
in very good Company, nor very inno|cently. The Hou&s;es he frequented were
either Brothels, or Night-Hou&s;es, and the Company con&s;i&s;ted of wild, and
thoughtle&s;s young Apprentices like him|&s;elf, or thorough-paced Rogues, who
ini|tiated the young ones into all the iniquitous Schemes and Arts they were
Ma&s;ters of. Tutors of Villainy like the&s;e, for whom <HI>Tyburn</HI> groans,
abound in Hou&s;es of this Sort, and young Scholars attend there in great
Numbers.</P>
<P>TOM keeping very bad Hours, was fre|quently lock'd out; but after
he had the Experience of three Weeks Learning from a Veteran, he knew how to
&s;educe his Ma&s;ter's Maid, and to prevail on her to let him in at any Hour.
This Kindne&s;s went not unrewarded: To di&s;charge his <PB N="106" REF="116">
Obligations to her, TOM robb'd his Ma&s;ter of Tea, Sugar, Spices and
Snuff.</P>
<P>THIS was a pretty Life, which he now not only renew'd, but
improv'd. He be|came a complete Buck and Blood, &s;allied out every Night in
Que&s;t of Adventures, beat the Watch, bullied Con&s;tables, de|moli&s;hed
Lamps, kicked Waiters, bilked Bawdy-Hou&s;es, and went Home reeling to Bed.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time he return'd to <HI>London</HI> from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> he attended the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head Society.</HI> Their Debates
charmed him, and he thought if he could be admitted a Member of &s;o
re&s;pectable and learned a Body, he &s;hould be quite happy. If Hap|pine&s;s
con&s;i&s;ted in being a Member, he was &s;oon in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, for
he was cho&s;en <HI>Nem. Con.</HI></P>
<P>RAKEWELL had a great Talent for Di&s;putation. He had a ready Wit,
great Volubility of Speech, and wanted not for a con&s;ummate A&s;&s;urance.
The&s;e Accompli&s;hments mu&s;t have endeared him greatly to the Society, and
he was look'd on as a valuable Acqui&s;ition. It is true, there was no Solidity
of Judgment, no Depth of Knowledge in him, any more <PB N="107" REF="117"> than
in his Friend SCAMPER; but he had no le&s;s Art in exciting the Admiration of
the Superficial, and the Ignorant, (a va&s;t Body of Men!) and in making his
Tin&s;el Ornaments pa&s;s for real Plate.</P>
<P>RAKEWELL's chief Fort was Re|ligion. He di&s;tingui&s;h'd
him&s;elf greatly on Subjects of this Kind, and was thought to be as good an
Orthodox Member as any in the Society. He combated the Dei&s;ts with the
invincible Armour of Revealed Religion, and played off the great Guns of
My&s;teries again&s;t them with no little Succe&s;s. As the Doctrine of
<HI>occult Cau&s;es</HI> is the greate&s;t Friend of Metaphy&s;icians and
natural Philo&s;ophers, and &s;erves as a Retreat for them where no Foes can
enter; &s;o, when pre&s;&s;ed by Argument, or urged by Authority, the Dei&s;ts
would demand Rea&s;ons for A&s;&s;ertions, and Proofs for <HI>Ip&s;e
Dixits,</HI> RAKEWELL would prudently retire from the Charge, and tell them
that where Faith begins, Rea&s;on ends&mdash;that the Natural Man cannot
comprehend Spi|ritual Subjects&mdash;that what is an Object of Faith, cannot be
intelligible by Rea&s;on&mdash;and that though Revealed Religion may &s;eem
above Rea&s;on, yet it is not again&s;t it. The&s;e, and many other An&s;wers
of the like Kind, he gave to the Heterodox <PB N="108" REF="118"> Gentry, and
ever &s;hew'd an inviolable Re&s;olution to defend Religion in general, and the
E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church in particular, again&s;t all the Attacks of their Foes:
In Con&s;equence of which, the Society look'd on him as an honourable Member,
and a very learned and ingenious Man. After Debates on &s;uch Subjects, and
Holy Ar|guments alledged in Favour of his Opi|nions, our Orator would leave the
Society, and proceed to his u&s;ual Night Entertain|ments, of breaking the
Lamps, and going Home to his Girls, where he rioted in Exce&s;s of
Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>BY &s;ome Means or other, RAKEWELL had got acquainted with an old
Maiden Lady, worth no le&s;s than Thirteen Hun|dred Pounds. After paying his
Addre&s;&s;es to her for &s;ome Time, he gain'd her Heart, and a Day was
propo&s;ed for Marriage. The antiquated Virgin, not doubting the Ho|nour of her
Lover, the Day before the intended Marriage, transferr'd over her whole Fortune
to him. The Lover was now happy. He &s;old out the Thirteen Hundred Pounds Old
South Sea An|nuities, and Three per Cent. Bank An|nuities, immediately. With
the Money the&s;e produced, he &s;et up a Chariot and Pair, took genteel
Lodgings in <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> <PB N="109" REF="119"> and appear'd in every
Re&s;pect as a Man of Fortune, quite regardle&s;s of the Attempts that might be
made on him by the Sons of Law, and hoping to find out &s;ome other wealthy
Dame, with whom he might meet with equal Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT though RAKEWELL was &s;afe with Re&s;pect to the Revenge
threaten'd him by the Lady he had tricked, and her Friends, yet his high Living
and Extravagance &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated his Sub&s;tance, and he was at a Lo&s;s
what to do. Paying ready Money for &s;ome Time, however, induced Trade&s;|men
to give him Credit; and having run in Tick to the Amount of Three Hundred
Pounds, with various People; and being dunned, and threatened &s;everal Times
by the mo&s;t Importunate of them, he was in|duced to &s;hift his Quarters, to
go away from his Lodgings without &s;ettling with his Landlord or his Footman
(for he kept one to the la&s;t) and &s;et out again for <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>
<P>ON his Arrival there he told his Father a mi&s;erable Story, of
his having been rob|bed of Five Hundred Guineas, of his ha|ving a Combat with
the Highwaymen that had robbed him, and of his having em|ploy'd &s;everal
active Fellows to go in Search of them. His Father &s;eeing him 
<PB N="110" REF="120"> well-dre&s;&s;ed, and appear more like a Lord than
<HI>his</HI> Son, te&s;tified his Joy at his Re|turn. RAKEWELL then voluntarily
men|tioned his having robbed him of fifty-&s;even Guineas; and, putting a Bill
in his Hand, drawn on the mo&s;t eminent Banker in <HI>London,</HI> for One
Hundred Pounds, told him, he was not to look on that as a Re|compence in full,
but as an Earne&s;t only of what he &s;hould receive. He then in|formed him of
his having married a Lady worth Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds but a Fortnight ago;
that he was then going to <HI>Penzance</HI> to &s;ettle Affairs with her
Guar|dian, and would return to <HI>London</HI> in five Days, where his Lady
impatiently expect|ed him.</P>
<P>THE good old Man was &s;o overjoy'd at hearing this Account of his
Son's good Fortune, that he fell on his Neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him, and with
Tears in his Eyes told him, that he was glad to hear of his Succe&s;s in Life;
but that he had no Occa|&s;ion for the Hundred Pounds he had given him, he
having, by his Care and Indu&s;try, &s;ince his leaving him la&s;t, &s;aved up
Twen|ty-&s;even Pounds; and therefore he begged him to take back again his
generous Gift of a Hundred Pounds, as, till his Affairs were &s;ettled, he
might have Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="121"> BUT this RAKEWELL declined, and ob&s;erved,
that the Trifle he had given him, he could well &s;pare; that he in&s;i&s;ted
on his keeping it; and that in a Fort|night he might have the Plea&s;ure of
treb|ling it to him. The old Man, filled with Joy at &s;eeing &s;uch a Son,
&s;eemed perfectly happy; went about to his Friends&mdash;told them of his
Son's good Fortune&mdash;invited them to his Hou&s;e&mdash;bought the
greate&s;t Dainties he could po&s;&s;ibly procure&mdash;and at Eight at Night
the Hou&s;e was full of Gue&s;ts, drinking Wine, Punch, and Beer, while roa&s;t
Gee&s;e were at the Fire, Fowls in the Pot, and &s;ome other &s;ub&s;tantial
Di&s;hes provided, to entertain the Friends on the Prodigal's Return; a
Prodigal, that had been guilty of &s;ome Er|rors, that had been bred in
Ob&s;curity, and was now rai&s;ed to great Grandeur.</P>
<P>THE Evening was &s;pent in great Jolity, and all but RAKEWELL were
perfecty in|toxicated. After all the Company was gone, the old Man, who&s;e
Heart was now quite merry, went to a private Clo|&s;et, took out a Bottle of
excellent Citron Water, and de&s;ired his Son to take a Gla&s;s. The Son obeyed
him, and the Father fol|lowed the Example. One Gla&s;s intro|duced 
<PB N="112" REF="122"> another, another followed, and, in &s;hort, the
Duumvirate emptied the Bottle. The Son was now what they call half-&s;eas over;
but the old Man was &s;o intoxicated, he could heither &s;it or &s;tand. With
&s;ome Difficulty RAKEWELL got him to-bed, took the Key out of the Door, locked
it, and then&mdash;went down Stairs.</P>
<P>HE began now to ran&s;ack the Hou&s;e, immediately &s;eized the
old Man's twenty-&s;even Pounds, and took every Thing away he could
conveniently carry. He then went to the Inn he had put up at on his fir&s;t
coming to Town, ordered a Po&s;t Chai&s;e, and told the Driver to go on as
fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P>A CHANGE of Chai&s;es &s;oon brought him to <HI>London;</HI> and
it happening to be on a <HI>Monday</HI> Night, he attended at the
<HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head Society,</HI> and &s;poke to the Que&s;tion, which was;</P>
<Q>Whether, even in this World, a vicious and immoral Man, is not
&s;everely pu|ni&s;hed? And if Virtue di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, does not feel greater
Happine&s;s than exal|ted Vice? 
<BIBL>PLATO.</BIBL></Q>
<P> <PB N="113" REF="123">RAKEWELL took the Affirmative Side of the
Que&s;tion, and proved, beyond all Manner of Contradiction, that Vice and
Immorality met with its Puni&s;hment, by inflicting the Stings of Con&s;cience
at pre|&s;ent, and the Dread of future Pain. Not that this Doctrine, he
ob&s;erved, tended in the lea&s;t to &s;et a&s;ide that of a future
Retri|bution of Rewards and Puni&s;hments in another State; where, as we are
taught by the Chri&s;tian Religion, that Suffering Virtue will meet its ample
Reward, and Triumphant Vice be &s;uitably puni&s;hed: But the Commi&s;&s;ion of
good Actions, and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our having performed our Duty,
gave a placid Serenity to our Minds, and a Compo&s;ure to our Thoughts: A
Felicity which the Huzzas of applau|ding Thou&s;ands could not give, nor the
Hi&s;&s;es of detracting and bitter Enemies take away. He took Notice al&s;o of
the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Agonies of Mind a wicked Man always laboured under,
through a Fear of being expo&s;ed, and his Wicked|ne&s;s revealed to the World;
which would con&s;equentially draw on him the &s;evere Penalties of the Law,
and the ju&s;t Dete&s;|tation of Mankind. He in&s;i&s;ted on it, that the
continual Apprehen&s;ions of Di&s;co|very a wicked Man mu&s;t be under, and 
<PB N="114" REF="124"> the Terrors of an abu&s;ed Con&s;cience, mu&s;t prevent
the Approaches of Happine&s;s, and da&s;h the Cup of Plea&s;ure with a great
De|gree of nau&s;eous and bitter Herbs. He then launched out into the
Plea&s;ures of Vir|tue and Religion; and made it appear, that their Votaries
reaped greater Sati&s;|faction, and ta&s;ted a more home-felt Plea|&s;ure than
could po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult from the highe&s;t Gratifications of &s;en&s;ual
Appetite, or mere Animal Bli&s;s. To prove the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions, he quoted a
few Authors he had either read or heard of, as Enforcers of his Sentiments, and
as Authors of his Doc|trine: A great Name frequently proves more than a &s;ound
Argument; and People, with whom Learning and Rea&s;on have no Sort of Weight,
are yet prevailed on to re&s;ign their Judgments, and to give up their Opinions
to an Antient whom Time has &s;anctified, or to an illu&s;trious Ortho|dox
Writer, who&s;e Notions and Senti|ments have been honoured and embraced by the
World.</P>
<P>THE Speech RAKEWELL delivered was well received, and the Society
thought no one could excel him in Propriety of Thought, or Regularity of
Conduct. Af|ter the Debates were over, RAKEWELL left the Society, and
traver&s;ed the Streets, <PB N="115" REF="125"> till he met with a Female he
liked, and with whom he went to the mo&s;t conveni|ent Bagnio.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he continued for &s;ome Time, an unaccountable
Aenigma, which none was able to &s;olve: But being at ength di&s;covered to
have robbed a Gentle|man of Eminence in <HI>Gro&s;venor-Square,</HI> he was
tried, convicted, and condemned, and executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> at the very
Time that his Colleague and Companion, the facetious BOB SCAMPER
&s;uffered.&mdash;Thus was the Society deprived of two of their be&s;t Members,
the mo&s;t powerful and ornamental Pillars of their Fabric.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome &s;hort Time after this the So|ciety was ob&s;erved to
dwindle away, and its &s;taunch Advocates and firm Friends be|gan to fear that
its Di&s;&s;olution was nigh. Some imputed it to the Ab&s;ence of two of their
be&s;t Speakers, and the De&s;pair the Public in general had of hearing any
Thing debated on by able Orators, now the be&s;t were gone: Some imagined, that
the melancholy Fate of tho&s;e two Mem|bers deterred People from attending a
So|ciety on which they had once reflected &s;uch Honour, and which was now
di&s;graced by <PB N="116" REF="126"> their ignominious Death; and &s;ome were
earne&s;tly wi&s;hing for its Annihilation.</P>
<P>IT was not long, however, before the Fears of the one Party, and
the Hopes of the other were turned into Certainty. The Society triumphed, their
Friends rejoiced, and their Enemies were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>To give a long Detail of every Event that happened in this
Society, to particu|larize all their Proceedings, and to cha|racterize all
their Members, would exceed the Bounds I have pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, and would
be uncommonly tedious: I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that from the Time
the Society was removed to the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head,</HI> it increa&s;ed both in
Num|bers and in Reputation; and &s;o well was it known, that Gentlemen who
lived in the Country, as well as Foreigners of all Nations, if in the lea&s;t
curious, learned, or ingenious, re&s;orted to it to hear De|bates that had &s;o
much attracted the At|tention, and extorted the Admiration of the World.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>Robinhood Society.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Year 1747, the Society was removed to the
<HI>Robinhood</HI> in <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> at that Time kept by Mr. HALL. The
Room here was va&s;tly more convenient than the other: New Benches were made,
in or|der that a greater Number of People might be admitted; a Branch for
eighteen <PB N="118" REF="128"> Candles was &s;u&s;pended from the Ceiling; a
large Chair for the Pre&s;ident, curiou&s;ly gilt, was erected; a Box to keep
the Book of Que&s;tions, was provided; a Hammer was purcha&s;ed for the
Pre&s;ident; and, in &s;hort, every Thing that was nece&s;&s;ary to reflect
Splendor on the Society, and to accommodate its Vi&s;itants in the be&s;t
Manner, was obtain'd by the indu&s;trious Landlord, who had formed great Hopes
of adding a Reputation to his Hou&s;e, and en|riching him&s;elf, from the
va&s;t Concour&s;e of People he expected would a&s;&s;emble there.</P>
<P>IN order to convey the be&s;t Idea I can of this famous Society to
the Mind of the Reader, I apprehend it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to give a fuller
Account of the Manage|ment of it, than I have before done.</P>
<P>EVERY Per&s;on that attended it, was to pay Six-pence; and that
while the&s;e Di&s;putants were enriching their Minds with the Trea&s;ures of
Knowledge, they might al&s;o practi&s;e the God-like Virtue of Charity, they
agreed, that out of every Six-pence the Landlord &s;hould be paid Four-pence
for each Quart of Lemonade and Porter; Three Half-pence &s;hould be 
<PB N="119" REF="129"> &s;et by, and appropriated to charitable U&s;es, to be
agreed on by a &s;elect Com|mittee appointed for that Purpo&s;e; and the
remaining Half-penny &s;hould be paid to the Clerk, as a Recompence for the
Trouble he was put to, in receiving each Per&s;on's Ticket, and taking Care
that the Society in general, and the Di&s;pu|tants in particular, were duly
&s;erv'd with Liquor.</P>
<P>A PERPETUAL Pre&s;ident was al&s;o ap|pointed, who&s;e Name was
JEACOCKE, who was to act as Moderator, and who had, indeed, given great
Satisfactio nin that Character at the <HI>E&s;&s;ex-Head,</HI> for four Years.
His Duty con&s;i&s;ted in reading whatever Que&s;tions were propo&s;ed for
Con&s;ideration, and offering them &s;eparately to the Choice of the Members:
Tho&s;e who cho&s;e that a Que&s;tion, &s;hould be ad|mitted, and enter'd in
the Book, were to &s;ignify it by holding up their Hands; and tho&s;e who did
not think it a proper Que&s;|tion, were to &s;ignify their Opinion in the
&s;ame Manner; and the Majority carried it. After this Part of his Duty, he was
to read the Que&s;tion for the Night's De|bate, and then a&s;k the &s;everal
Members whether they cho&s;e to &s;peak to it, begin|ning <PB N="120" REF="130"> with the Per&s;on who &s;at next to his left Hand, and proceeding
all round the Room 'till he came to the Per&s;on who &s;at next his right Hand.
When any Per&s;on got up to &s;peak, he was al&s;o to take Mi|nutes of what he
conceiv'd to be of par|ticular Importance, and by thus collecting the different
Sentiments of different People, he was enabled, when it came to his Turn to
&s;peak, to enforce the Arguments that &s;trengthen'd his own Opinion, and
invali|date tho&s;e that were again&s;t it. If no Per&s;on thought proper to
own a Que&s;tion, or to confe&s;s him&s;elf the Propo&s;er of it, then the
Pre&s;ident was the adopted Father, and he open'd the Que&s;tion, by explaining
the Terms of it, and concluded the De|bates on it, by a Speech of his own; but
if the Author of the Que&s;tion own'd it, then the Per&s;on next to his left
Hand &s;poke to it, and it was to go round in due Order, and the Propo&s;er
concluded it. The Pre|&s;ident was likewi&s;e to keep Order and De|corum in the
Society; to prevent any per&s;onal Altercations, or mean Invectives; to make
them &s;tick to the Point; to bring them back when they went a&s;tray; to &s;ee
likewi&s;e with the Clerk, that the Society was well &s;upplied with Liquor;
and, in &s;hort, to do every Thing that was for <PB N="121" REF="131"> the
Intere&s;t of the Society, and the Good of the Members pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>BY this Account of the Duty of the Pre&s;ident, it will appear
that his Trouble every Night was not little. It is always difficult to keep a
promi&s;cuous Company in good Order; and a Society, like the ROBINHOOD, where
every one is ad|mitted for his Six-pence, mu&s;t be liable to many
Irregularities. But though the Pre|&s;ident's Trouble was &s;o great, yet his
Attachment to, and Veneration for, the Society was &s;uch, that, unlike the
inte|re&s;ted Conduct of mo&s;t other Pre&s;idents, he acted <HI>Gratis,</HI>
contenting him&s;elf only with the Honour of the Office.</P>
<P>ONCE a Year a Paper was publi&s;h'd by the Society, containing a
Ju&s;tification of it from the Sneers of Witlings, and the Sarca&s;ms of &s;ome
&s;atirical Authors, and &s;etting forth its Nature and Tendency; and
underneath it, was an Account of the Number of People that had attended it all
the Year, di&s;tingui&s;hing the particular Number that met each
<HI>Monday</HI> Night. This was thought more likely to vindicate their Conduct,
and wipe off the A&s;per|&s;ions that had been thrown on them, than 
<PB N="122" REF="132"> an elaborate Defence; &s;ince by &s;eeing what a va&s;t
Number of People attended each Night, amounting in a Year's Time to upwards of
Five Thou&s;and, on a mo|derate Computation, the Public might perceive that no
le&s;s than Five Thou&s;and three Half-pennies were di&s;tributed in Cha|rity,
amounting to 31<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI>&mdash;And even &s;uppo&s;ing that the
Society could not vie in Splendor with the ROYAL SOCIETY, or in Dignity with
the ANTIQUARIAN, or in Numbers with the SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF ARTS,
MANU|FACTURES AND COMMERCE, and even granting their Antagoni&s;ts
A&s;&s;ertions to be true, that it was a Receptacle for the Illiterate and the
Impious, where horrid and bla&s;phemous Notions were defended and propagated,
and where Religion and Virtue were trodden under Foot; yet &s;till, it may be
urged from great Authority, that Charity <HI>covers</HI> a Multitude of
Sins.</P>
<P>THE Society now advancing in its Reputation, and &s;ome of the
mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Wits and Scholars frequenting it, it greatly excited
the public Attention. There was &s;carce a public Paper, but in the Cour&s;e of
its Animadver&s;ions, the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY was taken Notice 
<PB N="123" REF="133"> of. Doctor HENLEY vindicated it from his Ro&s;trum, and
comparing it to &s;ome of the famed A&s;&s;emblies of Yore, where a CICERO, or
a DEMOSTHENES harangued, he affirm'd it to be of the mo&s;t eminent Service to
Mankind, by mending their Morals, enlarging their Knowledge, and refining their
Ta&s;te; that it was infinitely preferable, con&s;ider'd as a School of
Ora|tory, to the Bar, or the Senate; and that it excell'd the Pulpit, both with
Re&s;pect to the Advancement of TRUE RELIGION, and the &s;preading of Human
Knowledge. Nay, he affirm'd it to be the Sun of the intellectual and moral
World, that with its radiant Beams enlighten'd, chear'd, and vivified the
Spiritual Sy&s;tem, as the Fir|mamental Sun doth the Natural.&mdash;In &s;hort,
he undertook to vindicate it from his Ro&s;trum in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields,</HI> from all the Calumnies and A&s;per&s;ions, that ever had been, or
could be rai&s;ed again&s;t it, and in&s;i&s;ted on its being the mo&s;t
perfect human In&s;titution that was ever form'd, except&mdash;his own
Oratory.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the Pulpits every where di&s;play'd its evil
Tendency, and re&s;ounded with its Infamy. The Clergy were &s;o much again&s;t
it, that, Surgeon|like, <PB N="124" REF="134"> they di&s;&s;ected and cut it up
without Mercy. They averr'd, that the Hou&s;e it&s;elf could not &s;tand long;
that it was a &s;econd Pandemonium, or A&s;&s;embly of evil Spirits; that
though they at pre&s;ent triumphed, yet they would &s;hortly be de|feated; and
that every one of the Members that compo&s;ed it, would infallibly be
d&mdash;d. Nay, one Reverend Gentleman in parti|cular,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That very popular Gentleman, the candid, the ingenious, and
ingenuous Mr. R&mdash;M&mdash;NE.</NOTE> prophe&s;ied, &s;ome Years after the
Period I am now de&s;cribing, that as it was ab&s;olutely certain, that the
Merchants that were &s;ettling their Books at the Earth|quake in
<HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> in the Year 1749, were &s;wallow'd up, and immediately
con&s;ign'd to the Care of the D&mdash;l; &s;o the ROBIN|HOOD would &s;hortly
meet the like Fate, or be torn from its Foundations, whirled through the Air by
the Prince of it, be carried, like OUR LADY OF <HI>Loretto,</HI> Thou&s;ands of
Leagues, and at Length, with its whole Cargo, thrown down to H&mdash;ll.</P>
<P>THE Society, however, in Spight of the&s;e Denunciations,
maintain'd its Ground, <PB N="125" REF="135"> and increa&s;ed in Fame. The
Names of the Members had been written in their Book of Que&s;tions, and new
ones were continually added. The Regulations they were under, were likewi&s;e
copied out fair; and the&s;e, with the Li&s;t of the Que&s;tions that
&s;ucceeded them, were open to every one's Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>THE Pre&s;ident di&s;charg'd his Tru&s;t with Fidelity and Honour,
and the Society in general thought them&s;elves much oblig'd to him for the
Care he had taken of their Intere&s;t, and the good Order and Regula|rity he
pre&s;erv'd.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. CALEB JEACOCKE, Or, As he is more frequently
called, The BAKER.</HEAD>
<P>MY Intention in giving a few Me|moirs of this Gentleman,
is not to &s;urpri&s;e the Reader, by a Relation of uncommon or intere&s;ting
Events, but merely to re&s;cue a Character, greatly traduced, and viely
mi&s;repre&s;ented, by all the Authors, as far as I have &s;een, who have
employ'd their Pens on this Subject.</P>
<P>IN the Lives of the Generality of Men, there is nothing
remarkable enough to &s;atisfy the Curio&s;ity of Readers, unle&s;s the
Imagination of the Author is exerted, to feign Events that never happen'd, and
employ his Hero in Scenes he was never engaged in. This is the Ca&s;e with Mr.
JEACOCKE. His Life has not been che|quer'd with tho&s;e variegated Hues that
make &s;o plea&s;ing an Appearance in the Biographer's Page, nor did he ever
run <PB N="127" REF="139"> through &s;uch a Variety of Adventures, as in the
Recital excite alternately the diffe|rent Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind.</P>
<P>HE was born in <HI>London,</HI> and having receiv'd &s;uch
an Education as enabled him only to read, write, and ca&s;t Accompts, he was
put Apprentice to a Baker. He behaved extremely well in his Appren|tice&s;hip,
and was pointed out as an Exam|ple for others in the &s;ame Station of Life. As
&s;oon as his Apprentice&s;hip was expir'd, by the generous Legacy of a good
old Aunt, he was enabled to &s;et up for him|&s;elf, and pitch'd upon St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s for that Purpo&s;e. He was remarkably diligent in his
Bu&s;ine&s;s, punctual in his Engage|ments, and, in every Re&s;pect, approv'd
him&s;elf a truly hone&s;t Man; &s;o that he was valued and e&s;teemed by every
one to whom he was known.</P>
<P>HAVING a perfect Knowledge of Ac|compts, and being
ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a clear Judgment, as could almo&s;t intuitively
di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;eparate Truth from Fal&s;e|hood, he was reque&s;ted by
many Mer|chants and Trade&s;men, who&s;e Accompts were long, embarra&s;&s;ed,
and intricate, to adju&s;t and &s;ettle them: And this he per|form'd 
<PB N="128" REF="140"> with an Expedition and Correct|ne&s;s, that few could
equal, and none excel; even after &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent Accomptants in
<HI>London</HI> had de&s;paired &s;ettling them, and pronounced them
im|po&s;&s;ible to be made out clear and evident.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE &s;miled on his Underta|kings, and he got Money
apace. His being appointed Pre&s;ident of the ROBIN|HOOD SOCIETY, made him
univer&s;ally known, and THE BAKER has been talk'd of, I believe, in every City
and Town in <HI>England.</HI> JEACOCKE was not aver&s;e to Popularity, nor in
Love with it for its intrin&s;ic Worth, but for the Benefit that accompanied
it, in making him known to &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in the Kingdom, and
&s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and wealthy Merchants, who&s;e Accompts he
&s;ettled, and for which he was paid very large Sums.</P>
<P>IN this Situation he continued, increa|&s;ing his Wealth
and Fame, 'till the latter End of the Year 1761, when he thought proper to
re&s;ign his Office of Pre&s;ident of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, having con|tinued
in that honourable Station nineteen Years: And in a few Months afterwards, 
<PB N="129" REF="141"> he was appointed one of his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of
the Peace for the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> in which Capacity he now acts
with an Integrity and Honour, with a Clearne&s;s of Judgment, and a Fervour of
Humanity, excell'd by none. He is con&s;i|der'd by the Rational and Judicious,
as a tacit Satire on the Practice of &s;ome trading Ju&s;tices, who &s;ell
their <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> as a <HI>Grocer</HI> &s;ells his
Rai&s;ins and Sugar, at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> Pound.</P>
<P>THOUGH JEACOCKE has never re|ceiv'd, what we term, a
liberal Educa|tion, yet his Mind is &s;tored with a greater Stock of real
Knowledge, than nineteen Parts out of twenty of tho&s;e who have breathed a
College Air for many Years. But though his Judgment is clear, and his Knowledge
exten&s;ive, yet his unbounded Humanity, his amiable Chearfulne&s;s, his
di&s;creet Complai&s;ance, his incorruptible In|tegrity, are &s;till
&s;uperior. His Philanthropy is &s;o great, that Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s
never applied to him in vain. His Advice and Pur&s;e were ever open to the
Indigent; but his Knowledge of the World teaching him to di&s;tingui&s;h
between real and pre|tended Di&s;tre&s;s, between hone&s;t Poverty and artful
Villainy, whenever he found <PB N="130" REF="142"> Examples of the latter, he
was as rigorous in inflicting Puni&s;hments, as in the former he was ready to
afford Relief. In his De|portment he is grave, but not au&s;tere; &s;erious,
but not melancholy; chearful, but not merry; re&s;erved, but not hypo|critical.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Judgment without O&s;tentation; Humility without
Mean|ne&s;s; and Worth without Pride. Ever open to Conviction, in his Office of
Pre&s;i|dent, he never obtruded his Opinions on his Auditors for certain
Truths, but re|tracted them, and own'd his Mi&s;takes, if pointed out.
<HI>Slave</HI> to no Sect, but a Friend and Member of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> he vindicated her from the rude A&s;&s;aults of Dei&s;ts and
Unbelievers, not by po&s;itive Dogmas, and mere <HI>Ip&s;e Dixits,</HI> but by
candid Rea&s;oning, and fair Argu|ment. When unacquainted with the Sub|ject of
Debate, he &s;ought not by retailing the Sentiments of others, to pa&s;s as an
in|telligent Man, or to take up their Time by delivering a String of Words
without Meaning, but left the Que&s;tion to be debated by tho&s;e who&s;e
Inclination or Si|tuation in Life put it in their Power to &s;peak to it
properly. By the&s;e Means, and having a retentive Memory, and a fine natural
Genius, and being remarkably <PB N="131" REF="143"> attentive to whatever was
&s;aid on every Subject, there are few he has not now a general Knowledge of,
and a great many he is particularly conver&s;ant in. His Rea&s;oning is
clo&s;e, but not void of Per&s;|picuity; and his Elocution free and na|tural,
but not rapid and verbo&s;e. He ever &s;trives rather to convince the Mind,
than to excite the Pa&s;&s;ions, and to deliver whol&s;ome Truths and u&s;eful
Precepts, than to charm the Imagination with Paradoxes, and lead the Soul to
Fairy Ground, by the Pomp of Words, and the Richne&s;s of Imagery; &s;o that
his Eloquence rather re&s;embles a &s;mooth and gentle Current that glides
&s;oftly along, than the foaming and maje&s;tic <HI>Tyber,</HI> or the rapid
<HI>Tagus,</HI> that rolls its golden Waves in Di&s;dain of Limits, overbearing
and &s;weeping every Thing before it.</P>
<P>JEACOCKE being &s;uch a Per&s;on as I have de&s;cribed, it
is no Wonder that he &s;hould be revered by the Society. He He had a prodigious
Influence over them, and kept them in more Awe, than a Pe|dagogue doth his
Scholars, or even than the Speaker of a great A&s;&s;embly can fre|quently keep
the Members, as Mr. A&mdash;R <PB N="132" REF="144"> O&mdash;S&mdash;W
him&s;elf once owned to Mr. JEACOCKE.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="memoir">
<HEAD>Mr. Orator HENLEY.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Account of this Phenomenon may not be unacceptable to
the Public. But as a better than I can give of him, has been already given in
one of the Notes to Mr. POPE'S <HI>Dunciad,</HI> I &s;hall extract that
Paragraph, and then hazard a few Remarks of my own on this &s;ingular
Genius.</P>
<Q>J. HENLEY the Orator; he preach'd on the <HI>Sundays</HI>
upon Theological Mat|ters, and on the <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> upon all other
Sciences. Each Auditor paid One Shilling. He declaimed &s;ome Years again&s;t
the greate&s;t Per&s;ons, and occa|&s;ionally did our Author that Honour.
WELSTED, in Oratory Tran&s;actions, No. I. publi&s;h'd by HENLEY him&s;elf,
gives the following Account of him: <PB N="133" REF="145"> He was born at
<HI>Melton Mowbray</HI> in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> From his own Pari&s;h
School he went to St. <HI>John's College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He began
there to be unea&s;y; for it <HI>&s;hock'd</HI> him to find he was
<HI>commanded to believe</HI> again&s;t his own Judgment in Points of Religion,
Philo&s;ophy, &amp;c. for his Genius leading him freely to <HI>di&s;pute all
Propo&s;itions,</HI> and <HI>call all Points to Account,</HI> he was impatient
under tho&s;e Fetters of the free-born Mind. Being admitted to Prie&s;t's
Orders, he found the Examina|tion very &s;hort and &s;uperficial; and that it
was not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to conform to the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> in order
either to <HI>Deacon&s;hip</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;thood.</HI> He came to Town, and
after having for &s;ome Years been a Writer for Book&s;ellers, he had an
Ambition to be &s;o for Mini|&s;ters of State. The only Rea&s;on he did not
ri&s;e in the Church, we are told, was the Envy of others, and a Di&s;reli&s;h
entertain'd of him, becau&s;e <HI>he was not qualified to be a complete
Spaniel.</HI> However, he offer'd the &s;ervice of his Pen to two great Men, of
Opinions and Intere&s;ts directly oppo&s;ite; by both of whom being rejected,
he &s;et up a new Project, and &s;tiled him&s;elf the <PB N="134" REF="146">
<HI>Re&s;torer of antient Eloquence.</HI> He thought it as lawful to take a
Licence from the King and Parliament at one Place, as another; at <HI>Hick's
Hall,</HI> as at <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> to &s;et up his Oratory in
<HI>Newport Market, Butcher Row.</HI> There (&s;ays his Friend) he had the
<HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> to form a Plan, which no Mortal ever thought of; he had
Succe&s;s again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition; chal|leng'd his Adver&s;aries to fair
Di&s;puta|tions, and <HI>none would di&s;pute</HI> with him: Writ, read, and
&s;tudied twelve Hours a Day; compo&s;ed three Di&s;&s;ertations a Week on all
Subjects; undertook to teach in <HI>one Year,</HI> what Schools and
Univer&s;ities teach in <HI>five;</HI> was not terrified by Menaces, In&s;ults,
or Satires, but &s;till proceeded, matured his bold Scheme, and put the
<HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>all that in Danger.</HI> 
<BIBL>WESLTED, Narrative in Orat. Tran&s;act. No.
I.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>AFTER having &s;tood &s;ome Pro&s;ecu|tions, he turn'd his
Rhetoric to Buf|foonry upon all public and private oc|currences. All this
pa&s;s'd in the &s;ame Room; where &s;ometimes he broke Je&s;ts, and
&s;ometimes that Bread which <PB N="135" REF="147"> he call'd the <HI>Primitive
Euchari&s;t.</HI>&mdash;This wonderful Per&s;on &s;truck Medals, which he
di&s;pers'd as Tickets to his Sub&s;cribers: The Device, a Star ri&s;ing to the
Meridian, with this Motto, AD SUMMA; and below, INVE|NIAM VIAM AUT FACIAM. This
Man had a Hundred Pounds a Year given him for the &s;ecret Service of a Weekly
Paper of unintelligible Non|&s;en&s;e, call'd the Hyp-Doctor. 
<BIBL>POPE'S Works, Vol. V.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Doctor was indeed a Compo&s;ition of Incon&s;i&s;tency
and Singularity. He wanted not Sen&s;e or Learning, but perverted both to the
mo&s;t unworthy Purpo&s;es. He un|der&s;tood the Principles of Religion very
well; but his chief Delight was in making it appear ridiculous, by the
ludicrous Light in which he view'd it him&s;elf, and repre|&s;ented it to
others. As to any fix'd Prin|ciples, with Re&s;pect to political Notions, he
had none, but employ'd all his Talents to laugh at, and make all Government
appear a mere Joke. But though the Doctor under&s;tood Religion tolerably well,
and could, when he thought proper, com|pare the different Sects, and exhibit
their various Excellencies in a &s;triking and pic|ture&s;que 
<PB N="136" REF="148"> Manner, yet he was more di&s;|po&s;ed to cull out their
&s;everal Defects and Imperfections, &s;o as to make all of them appear mere
human Inventions, and the Creatures which intere&s;ted Prie&s;ts and art|ful
Knaves had dre&s;&s;ed up, to impo&s;e on, and frighten the Vulgar. His chief
Talent lay in Buffoonery, and making the mo&s;t amiable Things appear mere
Mon&s;ters, and hideous Caricatures. Thus Religion was vilified, her
Mini&s;ters traduced, Mo|rality laugh'd at, Merit treated as a mere Non-Entity,
and the greate&s;t Characters in the Kingdom taken to Pieces and ana|tomi&s;ed
with all the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s imagi|nable, every <HI>Sunday,</HI> when the
Ollio of Scandal and Non&s;en&s;e was &s;erv'd up to the Public. He was of an
over-bearing Temper, in&s;olent to his Inferiors, and unmannerly to his
Superiors. His Pride, which was exce&s;&s;ive, taught him to de&s;pi&s;e every
one with whom he conver&s;ed; and his Self-Love, which was inordinate, and
reign'd over him with a de&s;potic Sway, led him to &s;uppo&s;e, that every one
was inferior to him&s;elf in Point of Judgment. Hence that ridiculous Vanity
which was vi&s;ible in his every Action, and prompted him to enforce his own
Arguments with the mo&s;t indecent Noi&s;e and violent Ge&s;ticulations, 
<PB N="137" REF="149"> to di&s;regard the Sentiments of others, and to be
continually interrupting them in the Cour&s;e of their Rea&s;oning. As a
Com|panion, therefore, he was odious; as a Clergyman, indecent; as an Orator
re|prehen&s;ible; as a Chri&s;tian, culpable; and as Man, contemptible.</P>
<P>THE Doctor being &s;uch a Per&s;on as I have de&s;crib'd
him, it may be wonder'd that his Oratory &s;hould be &s;o prodigiou&s;ly
frequented: But, I apprehend, it is no Wonder at all. Novelties will always
attract; Scandal has Charms for many Appetites; and an unre&s;train'd
Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of railing again&s;t Religion and Go|vernment, will always
draw va&s;t Numbers of Infidels and Libertines to hear their Patron and
Advocate &s;ounding the Trum|pet of Sedition. Not but that others of a
different Ca&s;t attended the Oratory: Some came to laugh <HI>with</HI> the
Orator, and &s;ome to laugh <HI>at</HI> him: Some, to un|bend their Minds, and
forget the rigid Rules of Morality they had ju&s;t before heard in our Places
of public Wor&s;hip; and &s;ome to confirm them&s;elves in Infide|lity and
Impiety, and enable them&s;elves to become Di&s;putants.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="150"> THE Orator, with various Succe&s;s,
&s;till kept up his ORATORY KING GEORGE'S, or CHARLES'S CHAPEL, as he
differently term'd it, 'till the Year 1759, when he died. At its fir&s;t
E&s;tabli&s;hment it was amazingly crowded, and Money flowed in upon him apace;
and between whiles, it langui&s;hed and drooped: But for &s;ome Years before
its Author's Death, it dwin|dled away &s;o much, and fell into &s;uch an hectic
State, that the few Friends of it fear'd its Decea&s;e was very near. The
Doctor, indeed, kept it up to the la&s;t, determin'd it &s;hould live as long
as he did, and actually exhibited many Evenings to empty Benches. Finding no
one at length would attend, he admitted the Acquaintances of his Door-Keeper,
Runner, Mouth-Piece, and &s;ome others of his Followers, <HI>gratis.</HI> On
the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> however, the Doctor died, and the Oratory
cea&s;ed; no one having Iniquity or Impudence &s;uf|ficient to continue it on;
&s;ince which it is turn'd into a Trade&s;man's Warehou&s;e.</P>

not be &s;o common as it now is, to hear Chri&s;tianity ridiculed, and its
Mini&s;ters treated with Contempt. He has not for &s;ome Years frequented the
Society; but formerly was very often there, and was an Ornament to it. The
Speech which the Author of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY, <HI>a Satire,</HI> has put in

<HEAD>Mr. JOSEPH C*L***R.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great good Sen&s;e,
and many amiable Qua|lities. Fortune has not been very kind to him, but has
reduced him to the mortify|ing Nece&s;&s;ity of writing for Book&s;ellers. Were
there any other MECAENAS'S to be met with, it is probable that &s;o much Me|rit

an invincible Timidity &s;till hanging on him, and preventing a Di&s;play of
tho&s;e Abilities, and that good Sen&s;e he is Ma&s;ter of. One would naturally
imagine, that Knowledge &s;hould in&s;pire a becoming A&s;|&s;urance; and a

&s;hould make us &s;peak to it, with an intre|pid Spirit: But we often &s;ee

<P>THIS Gentleman is a Phy&s;ician of no &s;mall Eminence. He
is a Man of great Erudition, a nervous Writer, and a fine Speaker; though, in
the Pronunci|ation of many Words, he deviates from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;tom
&s;o much, as has &s;ubjected him to the Cen&s;ures of many Critics,
particularly the ingenious Authors of the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> and the

<Q>How are we to be certain of the Incor|ruptibility and
Freedom of a Parlia|ment? 
<BIBL>Sign'd, ARISTARCHUS.</BIBL></Q>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<P> THIS Que&s;tion is undoubtedly, Mr. Pre&s;ident,
of no &s;mall Importance; though whether it can be properly de|bated 
<PB N="163" REF="175"> in a Society like this, I much doubt. I don't
in&s;inuate by this Ob&s;er|vation, that &s;uch Gentlemen of Genius and
Judgment as honour us with their Company, are incapable of determining this
Que&s;tion, and a&s;certaining the Marks whereby we may judge and
di|&s;tingui&s;h a free and incorrupt Parlia|ment from a venal and corrupt one;
but am afraid, very much afraid, that tho&s;e Marks are not &s;o ea&s;y to be
point|ed out in any <HI>extempore</HI> Speech. To &s;peak to a Que&s;tion of
this Nature pro|perly, requires a previous Con&s;ideration of the Subject, and
a deliberate Thought of what we are to utter, le&s;t a ha&s;ty Judgment, or
crude Conjectures, might mi&s;lead in&s;tead of informing a candid Searcher
after Truth. I &s;hall, however, attempt to point out &s;ome Criterions to
judge of a free and incorrupt Parlia|ment, which, I apprehend, may be looked on
as infallible; though I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily omit others, perhaps not le&s;s
important, which the Brevity of Time allowed me, will not permit my
men|tioning.</P>
<P> A FREE and incorrupt Parliament the People will
ever repo&s;e the utmo&s;t Con|fidence <PB N="164" REF="176"> in, and though
their Deci&s;ions may be &s;ometimes erroneous, they will never be unju&s;t.
When this is the Ca&s;e, it will appear evidently by the following Marks,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P> WHEN the Members of Parliament act with a
vi&s;ible Independency, and will not &s;uffer any one Man to lead them by the
No&s;e, or brow-beat them into Com|pliance with his Schemes, and thereby
de&s;troy that Equality which is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve the
Liberty of the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P> WHEN all the Acts and Re&s;olutions of Parliament
are manife&s;tly calculated for the public Good, and not to &s;erve any dark
and private Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P> WHEN the Conduct of Gentlemen in Employment makes
it evident, that they are under no Re&s;traint in the Hou&s;e, but are left at
full Liberty to give their Votes, upon all Occa&s;ions, according to their
Con&s;ciences and Opi|nions.</P>
<P> THIS is, indeed, the &s;tronge&s;t Mark of a free
Parliament, and we may certain|ly <PB N="165" REF="177"> conclude it to be the
Ca&s;e, when the Members, who are in Office, do not con&s;tantly run in Herds,
and &s;lavi&s;hly follow a Mini&s;ter in all his Propo&s;als; but when it is
ob&s;erved, on the con|trary, that they frequently divide again&s;t, what is
called, the Court Party, and are not turned out of their Places, at the End of
a Se&s;&s;ion, without any vi&s;ible Rea&s;on, but giving a Vote, perhaps,
again&s;t &s;ome favourite Que&s;tion, or to make Room for others, who&s;e only
Merit is a &s;ordid, pliant, and pro&s;titute Compli&s;ance.</P>
<P> IN &s;hort, Gentlemen, a Parliament cannot be
truly denominated free, which lies under any Re&s;traint or Di&s;courage|ments
what&s;oever; nor will their Re|&s;olutions have any other Weight than what
Force gives them; for I will ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that the mo&s;t
incon&s;ider|able Minority, or even one hone&s;t Man, of the meane&s;t
Under&s;tanding, is a better Judge of political Affairs than the large&s;t
Majority, which is packed together, and bribed to &s;erve the Pur|po&s;es of a
bad Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="178"> BY viewing our own
Parliament, and having an Eye to the Marks and To|kens I have pointed out, we
may be enabled to judge whether it is &s;uch a one as mentioned in the
Que&s;tion. I hope, I tru&s;t it is, and that it is quite oppo&s;ite to one I
well remember, a few Years ago, when the grand Corrupter pre&s;ided at the
Helm. Under his Ad|mini&s;tration Bribery and Corruption were reduced to a
<HI>Su&s;etem,</HI> Election-Jobbing was carried on as openly as any other
Trade, all Virtue and Mo|rality were laughed out of Countenance, the
intere&s;ts of Religion were di&s;regard|ed, and its &s;acred Foundations
under|minded, and &s;apped by Vice and Vena|lity. Nay, the great Engine of
Cor|ruption had &s;o de&s;picable an Opinion of <HI>hooman</HI> Nature, that he
laid it down as an inconte&s;tible Truth, that no Man could, in the true
Sen&s;e of the Word, de&s;erve the Appellation of Patriot, <HI>for every Man
had his Price.</HI> I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e Remarks with a beautiful
Pa&s;&s;age from our great Poet, de&s;cribing the Si|tuation of Things at this
Juncture, re|marking, by the Way, that every Thing was &s;ub&s;ervient to the

<P>THIS Per&s;on is con&s;ider'd of &s;o much Importance in
the Society, that he has frequently acted as Pre&s;ident, in which Character he
has appeared in a very &s;ingu|lar Light. To draw a Compari&s;on be|tween
J**C**KE and him, might appear invidious, and is certainly unnece&s;&s;ary;
&s;ince every one that has &s;een each of them in the Chair but once, mu&s;t
have perceiv'd <PB N="173" REF="185" MS="y"> the Difference. He is by Trade a
Cabinet Maker, and lives in <HI>L&mdash;g A&mdash;e.</HI> He was born at
<HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and tho' he has been &s;ettled in
<HI>London</HI> &s;ome Years, he retains much of his Country Dialect. Whether
he &s;corns the ignoble Path of Imitation, or whether having no Sen&s;e of what
is proper and improper in the Conduct of others, he is an Original without
De&s;ign, we are not enough ac|quainted with his Principles of Action to
determine: But his Manner of opening and conducting the Debates of the Night,
is, in all Re&s;pects, different from that of every other Pre&s;ident of every
Di&s;pu|ting-Club that we have either heard of, read of, or &s;een.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t Movement is a very &s;ingular
<HI>Manoeuvre,</HI> or rather <HI>Doit-O Euvre:</HI> It is a deliberate
Exten&s;ion of the Fore-finger and Thumb of his Right-hand to that Part of the
Candle which is inflam'd, and which he &s;uddenly compre&s;&s;es between his
&s;aid Fore-finger and Thumb, giving it a cer|tain Pull, call'd by the
<HI>Romans, Vellicatio:</HI> and by this <HI>Doit-O Euvre,</HI> he &s;evers the
&s;aid inflamed Part of the Candle exactly in the Middle, ju&s;t as a
School-boy &s;evers a Half-penny Cake, for a Moiety of which 
<PB N="174" REF="186"> he has received a Farthing from one of his
School-fellows; or, as a facetious old Gentleman divides and &s;ub-divides the
Fragments of a Tobacco-Pipe, while with circum&s;tantial Exactne&s;s he relates
&s;ome amorous Adventure of his youthful Days. After the u&s;ele&s;s
Excre&s;cence of the Can|dle is thus nicely vellicated, the worthy Pre&s;ident
ca&s;ts it on the Floor, with a Grace &s;imilar to that, which one Poet &s;ays
another exhibits with his Dung; and then, while Mirth &s;its on every Face, and
&s;parkles in every Eye, wiping his afore&s;aid Fore-finger and Thumb upon his
Leathern Breeches, or Black Everla&s;ting Wai&s;tcoat, he cries out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Will you be plea&s;ed, Gentlemen, <HI>to

<P>THE &s;econd Part of his great Work is, to open the Book

I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that for my own Part, I think a <HI>Sollier</HI> is the

that bad's the be&s;t. The mo&s;t <HI>commone&s;t</HI> Thing in the World is to

<HEAD>Mr. S**TH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman is by Trade a Dyer, and in Religion a
red-hot <HI>Antimonian.</HI> When he bellows forth his peculiar No|tions, his
Eyes are inflamed, and his whole Body &s;eems to be the Man&s;ion of &s;ome
turbulent Spirit. He is no tame Orator, nor wants for Choice of Words, but is
&s;o unhappy in the Application of them, that he conveys a quite different
Meaning <PB N="179" REF="191"> to the Minds of the Auditors from what he
him&s;elf under&s;tands: Let the Que&s;tion be what it will, he lugs in
Religion by the Head and Shoulders, and the mo&s;t carnal Propo&s;ition is
&s;piritualized into the mo&s;t divine Meaning: Thus, the &s;ecret Parts of
Religion are all peeped into and expo&s;ed, and Di&s;cour&s;es in the Style of
the <HI>Canticles,</HI> propo&s;ed as proper for Imi|tation. S**TH is a great
Admirer of WHITFIELD, and thinks him one of the greate&s;t Men in
<HI>Europe.</HI> If Regard is extorted, and E&s;teem rivetted, by a mutual
Sympathy of Minds, and a &s;imilar Turn of Thinking, it is no Wonder our Orator
&s;hould have conceived an high Opinion of his Brother Orator: And, indeed,
their Oratory is not much unlike, for Orator S**TH is as ranting, as
unin|telligible, and as enthu&s;ia&s;tic, as Orator WH**F***D.</P>

<P>AN Attorney, or an Attorney's Clerk, that pours out
Vollies of Non&s;en&s;e, as fa&s;t as a <HI>London</HI> Militia Platoon fire
their Mu&s;kets. He is a profe&s;&s;ed Advocate for all mini&s;terial

like Kings, can do no Wrong. If his Opponents in&s;i&s;t, that if they
<HI>can</HI> do no Wrong, they mu&s;t be infallible, and In|fallibility only is
the Attribute of GOD; he an&s;wers, they are infallible, and are ap|pointed by
GOD; &s;o that the divine inde|fea&s;ible Right of Kings, with all its
con|commitant Circum&s;tances of Non-Re&s;i|&s;tance and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience,
are &s;trongly enforced by this ingenious Quill-driver in every Political
Debate. If it is objected to him, that the <HI>Jure Divino</HI> is a Doctrine
that &s;trikes at the Vitals of our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, by tacitly
declaring the glori|ous Revolution to be an U&s;urpation, and the pre&s;ent
illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to be mere P**t**d**s to the Throne,
he will not di&s;pute the Inference, but maintain his Po&s;ition.&mdash;So much
for his Political Notions. As to his religious ones, <PB N="183" REF="195"> he
is not le&s;s &s;trenuous. He thinks the Church, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in this
King|dom, not only the be&s;t vi&s;ible Church on Earth, but that it is
ab&s;olutely without Spot or Blemi&s;h; and he would have as implicit a Regard
paid to all human Ordi|nances and Ceremonies as to the mo&s;t divine Precepts;
and in con&s;equence of the&s;e ve|ry orthodox and very charitable Opinions, he
thinks all who di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, <HI>&s;hould
immediately quit</HI> England, <HI>and re&s;ide el&s;ewhere:</HI> But to what
Place they are to retire he does not inform us. As to the Dei&s;ts, he la&s;hes
them without Mercy, and pronounces it impo&s;&s;ible for them to be u&s;eful
Subjects, or hone&s;t Men; and therefore, as they cannot be &s;erviceable in a
State, they &s;hould be bani&s;hed from it, or broke upon the Wheel, or, at
lea&s;t, be kept in Pri&s;on to hard Labour, till their Minds are open to
Conviction, and prepared to believe the glorious Truths of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IT is with no &s;mall Difficulty we have fathomed the&s;e
Sentiments of our Man of Law; who brings together &s;uch a Cloud of unmeaning
Words, that it requires a very penetrating Eye to &s;ee through the
Ob&s;curity: That Eye we think we po&s;|&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="196"> AS an Orator, he is extremely
con|temptible: His Action is forced, violent, and unnatural, and his

very wrong ones. His mental Op|tics are extremely defective, and he views
Things by &s;uch broken and refracted Rays, as render them &s;carcely

<HEAD>Mr. A. M. E. C**KE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Readers will wonder what My|&s;tery is couched under
the Letters A. M. E. and &s;ome will &s;uppo&s;e that they are no more than the
Initials of Mr. C**KE'S Chri&s;tian Names&mdash;His Chri&s;tian Name is THOMAS;
but &s;ince a certain Operation he perform'd on him&s;elf, he 
<PB N="187" REF="199"> has, in his numerous Writings, intitled him&s;elf A. M.
E. C**KE; Letters, which though unintelligible to the Public, are yet full of
Meaning to us, who have a great Intimacy with this Gentleman; and they
&s;ignify ADAM, MOSES, EMA|NUEL.&mdash;So much for his adopted Name.</P>
<P>HE was born in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> re|ceiv'd a
liberal Education there, and from thence was &s;ent to <HI>Oxford:</HI> In due
Time he enter'd into Orders, return'd to his native County, and was &s;oon
after pre|&s;ented with a pretty good Living. A Turn for My&s;teries led him to
a Peru&s;al of &s;ome of our my&s;tic Writers, and he caught the &s;ame
enthu&s;ia&s;tic Flame which warm'd them. A reclu&s;e and &s;edentary Life
greatly cheri&s;h'd his Notions, and it was not long before Par&s;on C**KE was
look'd on by all the Country as a &s;econd JACOB BEHMEN. But he had &s;ome
Notions peculiar to him&s;elf. He maintain'd in his Sermons, and in his private
Conver&s;ation, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies were not ab|rogated by
the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, but were &s;till of univer&s;al Obligation.
In par|ticular, he in&s;i&s;ted on the Nece&s;&s;ity of Circumci&s;ion, and
&s;upported his Doctrine by his own Practice. Such novel Notions, 
<PB N="188" REF="200"> and &s;uch extravagant Behaviour in a Pro|te&s;tant
Clergyman, &s;oon reached the Ears of the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e, and he was
deprived, and his Living given to another. Our <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tian
then came to <HI>London,</HI> and commenced Author; but his unintelli|gible
Jargon not &s;elling, he was reduced to great Di&s;tre&s;s. In this Dilemma he
knew not what to do; but, at la&s;t, put in Practice another odd Notion, that
the Goods of Fortune ought to be &s;hared in common by all God's
Creatures..</P>
<P>AMONG various Expedients for &s;atisfying his Hunger
formed upon this Plan, one was, to re&s;ort to &s;ome well-frequented
Coffee-hou&s;e, and placing him&s;elf at a Table, to appropriate to his own
U&s;e the fir&s;t buttered Muffin and Pot of Coffee that was brought to it.
This he would often be permitted to do, without any In|terruption from the
Gentlemen that &s;at near him, &s;ome of whom were diverted, and &s;ome
a&s;toni&s;hed, to &s;ee a Clergyman thus familiarly regale him&s;elf with a
Break|fa&s;t that was not provided for him. As &s;oon as it was fini&s;hed,
however, he would ri&s;e from the Table, &s;ay a &s;hort Grace, and very
unconcernedly make towards the Door; and, when que&s;tioned by the 
<PB N="189" REF="201"> Ma&s;ter of the Coffee-hou&s;e, about the Impropriety of
u&s;ing that which he did not order, and the Inju&s;tice of not paying for it
when he had done, he would prove by Mode and Figure, that the good Things of
this World ought to be in common. The Bucks and Bloods enjoyed the Joke, and a
Ring was u&s;ually formed for the two Di&s;putants, the Par&s;on and the
Coffee-man; but the Coffee-man being unable to invalidate the Te&s;timonies
brought out of the <HI>Talmud,</HI> and many learned Writings, which were
quoted in <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> the Par&s;on always came
off vic|torious.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Practice by which this Gentleman &s;ignalized
him&s;elf, was Street-Preaching; and having for &s;ome Time before let his
Beard grow, he was gene|rally known by the Name of <HI>The Bearded
Prie&s;t.</HI> In this extravagant Manner he went on for &s;ome Time, 'till
&s;ome Clergymen made Intere&s;t for him to be &s;ent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> where
he was confined for about two or three Years. As &s;oon as he was relea&s;ed,
he took a Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and actually travel|led
over that Country on Foot, with not a &s;ingle Farthing in his Pocket,
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting, <PB N="190" REF="202"> as him&s;elf informs us in one of his
Pamph|lets, by the Contributions of the well|di&s;po&s;ed. From thence he went
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and travelled over a great Part of that Kingdom; and on
his Arrival at <HI>Dublin,</HI> in 1760, was entertained by &s;ome Gen|tlemen
in <HI>Trinity College,</HI> who, compa&s;|&s;ionating the melancholy Ca&s;e of
a Clergy|man in Di&s;tre&s;s, gave him his Board and Lodging <HI>gratis.</HI>
After he had &s;taid here a few Months, and publi&s;hed &s;ome ve|ry
<HI>original</HI> Pieces, which no one could under&s;tand but him&s;elf, he
return'd to <HI>England,</HI> vi&s;ited <HI>Oxford,</HI> and then came again to
<HI>London,</HI> where he now re&s;ides, but intends going to <HI>America,</HI>
as &s;oon as his Finances will enable him.</P>

<P>A COMEDIAN belonging to the Theatre in <HI>Covent

excels as an Orator, having a full, round, and &s;trong Voice, a Facility of

been defined by a great Poet, con&s;i&s;ts in a quick Conception, and an ea&s;y

at the low E&s;timation this Gentleman is held in here, as an Actor. We have
&s;een him perform <PB N="194" REF="206"> very capital Characters at the

Execution, and with uni|ver&s;al Applau&s;e; and mu&s;t own we are at a Lo&s;s

<HEAD>Mr. P**E.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN that, by his Oddity of A&s;pect, and Peculiarity of
Expre&s;&s;ion, has attracted the public attention in a con&s;i|derable Degree;
for he has been frequent|ly honoured by being made the Subject of &s;ome
E&s;&s;ays in our daily Papers.</P>
<P>HE was born at <HI>Exeter</HI> about fifty|eight Years
ago, of poor, but, as it is &s;aid, hone&s;t Parents, who &s;ent him to School,
where he learnt both to read and write. At the Age of thirteen he was
apprenticed there to a Shoemaker, and during his Apprentice&s;hip, took great
De|light in reading the delectable Poems of WITHERS, QUARLES, HERBERT,
CLEVELAND, and other <HI>very great</HI> Au|thors, and read them &s;o
frequently, that he got many of them by Heart. At the Expiration of his
Apprentice&s;hip, he came to <HI>London,</HI> and having received &s;ome
&s;mall Pittance from his Friends, &s;et up for him|&s;elf in the
<HI>Strand,</HI> took unto him a Wife, and had four or five Children by her. So
far we &s;ee the bright View of his Life's Hi&s;tory. But the World &s;oon
frowned <PB N="196" REF="208"> on him; and though he was continually 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;upplying his Knowledge-Box with
Furniture,"</Q> as him&s;elf elegantly ex|pre&s;&s;es it, by reading the
before-mentioned Authors, and attending con&s;tantly at Mr. Orator HENLEY'S
Chapel, to whom he was Mouth-Piece, running on his Errands, prai&s;ing his
Oratory, and doing him other Services, yet his Stock in Trade, his Hou&s;hold
Goods, his Cu&s;tomers, and his Reputation, were decrea&s;ing daily. Altho'
Poverty now not only &s;tared our Orator in the Face, but was his con&s;tant
Compa|nion, yet was he indefatigable in the Im|provement of his Mind, and bore
his Mi&s;ery with great Patience. But his <HI>Rib</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not
the &s;ame Fortitude. She lamented her Infelicity in very pathetic Terms, and
Tears ran from her Eyes in copious Streams. P*** beheld her Di&s;tre&s;s with
the Apathy of a Stoic; he an&s;wered her Complaints and Remon&s;trances with
&s;ome Ver&s;es of QUARLES, and her Tears he endeavoured to dry up with &s;ome
Sen|timents from HERBERT or CLEVELAND: but all would not avail; her Tongue
&s;till ran on, and her Tears &s;till flowed. She wanted more &s;ub&s;tantial
Food, than dull Lines of Jingle; and had rather &s;ee &s;ome Bread and
Chee&s;e, and &s;mall Beer <PB N="197" REF="209"> on the Table, for her&s;elf
and Children, than hear the be&s;t Arguments in the World, to prove that
<HI>whatever is, is right.</HI> Up|braidings and &s;evere Reproaches followed,
and the Wife in&s;i&s;ted, that the Hu&s;band was an idle Fellow, who neglected
his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the mo&s;t important Con|cerns, merely to prate about
Things he did not under&s;tand, and to attend the Athei&s;tical Orator, who&s;e
Di&s;cour&s;es he could never be benefitted by. After living &s;ome Years in
this uncomfortable State, the Wife and Children left the Hu&s;band to his Fate,
and pur&s;ued their own. The Wife took decent Lodgings, &s;ought out for
Bu&s;ine&s;s in Wa&s;hing and Plain-Work, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that &s;he
bred up her Children properly, wanted for nothing, and lived happily. As to our
Son of CRISPIN, he took a paltry Lodging, and went on in the &s;ame idle Manner
as be|fore, getting what Work he could, and putting it out to be performed. In
this Manner he has continued for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>As to the Oratory of this <HI>Poetical Cobler,</HI> as he
is u&s;ually called, it is, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Rudis, indige&s;taque moles,</L> 
<L>Non bene junctarum di&s;cordia &s;emina
rerum.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="210"> HIS Speeches do not con&s;i&s;t of
his own Sentiments on the Que&s;tion, but only of an Application of the
Sentiments of tho&s;e polite Authors he is mo&s;t conver&s;ant with. He is,
indeed, a mere Retailer of other Men's Opinions, and his Orations are like an
<HI>Harlequin</HI>'s patched Coat; and yet he has Vanity enough to think
him&s;elf a Man of great Knowledge; and takes the Laugh of Contempt, which he
frequently hears at the Society, for a Proof of their Approbation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PRESIDENT!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT there Gentleman, on this Side of the Way,
&s;eems to want a Light to be &s;truck into his Knowledge-Box: If he had opened
the Trap-Doors of his Mind, it might have entered in. But I find it has not;
and therefore, <PB N="199" REF="211"> his Under&s;tanding wants &s;nuffing. He
has really &s;poke like a Crabb-Lantern, and a Snap-Jack; &s;o I have done with
him. <HI>How&s;umdever,</HI> I &s;hall now take Notice of the other rum
Gentleman, who thought I was a Man of Fortune, in his &s;peaking to the la&s;t
rum Que&s;tion, in &s;o rum a Manner. 
<Q> 
<L>But tho' I in this Scarlet Coat appear,</L> 
<L>I am not worth a &s;ingle Groat a
Year.</L></Q> So much for him&mdash;As to the Que&s;tion, Mr. Pre&s;ident, I
think it is no Que&s;tion at all; for every one that has not De|traction in the
Head, and Prejudice in the Heart, mu&s;t own and confe&s;s, 
<Q> 
<L>That Words alone can Harmony impart,</L> 
<L>To charm th' Attention, and command the
Heart</L></Q> And that is Eloquence, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and &s;uch as mu&s;t be
admitted by all who do not &s;eek the Indulgence of their vo|racious Appetites:
And 
<Q> 
<L>Which Heads refin'd alone by Rea&s;on
know,</L> 
<L>Where Sen&s;e and Judgment do together
flow.</L></Q> Rea&s;on, Mr. Pre&s;ident, is King Na|ture's 
<PB N="200" REF="212"> Privy Coun&s;ellor; and Eloquence is to teach us 
<Q> 
<L>To rea&s;on down the Fever of the Blood,</L>

<L>And &s;ooth with Words the Tumult of the
Soul.</L></Q> I wi&s;h the Gentleman in his own Hair, yonder, who is now
picking his Teeth, and who looks with three Eyes at me, had mar&s;halled up his
Thoughts, har|monized his Under&s;tanding, regulated his Ideas, and informed
his Judgment; then he might 
<Q> 
<L>Blow away, and &s;peak at large,</L> 
<L>And with a holy Violence ram down the
Charge.</L></Q> In&s;tead of which he has taken hold of the Muzzle in&s;tead of
the But-End of the Doctrine, and hurried a half-formed Production on the
Public. 
<Q> 
<L>He has launch'd forth quite into wild
Ex|tremes,</L> 
<L>Of &s;en&s;ele&s;s Noi&s;e, and
undi&s;tingui&s;h'd Themes.</L></Q> <HI>How&s;umdever,</HI> Mr. Pre&s;ident, I
for|give him for his <HI>Fun-Daw&s;it</HI> on me; e&s;pecially, as his Thoughts
<HI>is</HI> &s;tagnated, <PB N="201" REF="213"> and an Embargo laid on his
Under|&s;tanding: For, 
<Q> 
<L>Forgivene&s;s to the Injur'd does
belong;</L> 
<L>They never pardon that have done the
Wrong.</L></Q> Eloquence, Mr. Pre&s;ident, may be de|fined to be, as it were,
as when a Man is eloquent; and to be &s;o, he ought to do as I do; that is,
drink a good deal of Gin, and avoid eating Onions. A great Poet &s;ays; 
<Q> 
<L>Immortal Gin! &s;ince I have &s;ung thy
Prai&s;e,</L> 
<L>Crown me with Juniper in&s;tead of
Bays,</L></Q> And that is Eloquence it&s;elf, Mr. Pre|&s;ident; and no one will
di&s;pute it that has poi&s;ed <HI>their</HI> Under&s;tanding, and not violated
the Dignity of human Nature. Tho&s;e who di&s;pute it, like my Wife's
Relations, 
<Q> 
<L>May the Cur&s;e of G&mdash; then light on
one and all,</L> 
<L>To d&mdash; their Bodies, but pre&s;erve
their Soul.</L></Q> As to that Gentleman that &s;aid Elo|quence is hurtful to
Society, becau&s;e Poets are eloquent, and, in con&s;equence 
<PB N="202" REF="214"> of it, poor, it by no Means follows;
<HI>how&s;umdever,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>If Thought alone the Appetite can clay,</L> 
<L>Could Poets live, Camelion-like, on Air;</L>

<L>If neither Thir&s;t or Hunger could
annoy,</L> 
<L>The poore&s;t Poet never need de&s;pair.</L></Q> So that this Gentleman's Speech was a fal&s;e Motion, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and
the Que&s;tion topped his Under&s;tanding; <HI>how&s;umdever,</HI> he cho&s;e
to &s;peak to it, le&s;t he &s;hould over-gorge him&s;elf, and bur&s;t at the
Touch-hole. Another Gentleman, who &s;aid as how Elo|quence was pernicious,
&s;eems to have contracted all his Sen&s;es into his Bow|&s;prit, to have
loaded his Head with Ar|gument, and then to have primed, cock|ed, and fired
away; <HI>how&s;umdever,</HI> I excu&s;e him, becau&s;e I find he is one of the
cro&s;s-legged Knights of the Steel-Bar, and a Wit. But Mr. POPE &s;ays, 
<Q> 
<L>A Wit's a Feather, and a Chief's a Rod;</L> 
<L>An hone&s;t Man's the noble&s;t Work of
<HI>GOD.</HI></L></Q> Eloquence, Mr. Pre&s;ident, is the Gift of the SUPREME;
and we <HI>oft</HI> not to de&s;pi&s;e any of his Gifts: Now, if I had 
<PB N="203" REF="215"> the Wi&s;dom of ULYSSES, the Arms of ACHILLES, the
Riches of CROESUS, and the Wi&s;dom of SOLOMON, 
<Q> 
<L>I'd &s;cower the Univer&s;e from Folly and
from Vice,</L> 
<L>And make this World a &s;econd
Paradi&s;e.</L></Q> But I fear it's impo&s;&s;ible for me to do this, though,
with Eloquence, one might almo&s;t do any Thing, even if one were attacked both
in Front and Flank, and knocked down in the Rear. But I think that tho&s;e
&s;hould, 
<Q> 
<L>Who &s;trive to di&s;compo&s;e th' exalted
Mind,</L> 
<L>Be to eternal Bani&s;hment confin'd.</L></Q>
And &s;ome of the&s;e there are in this So|ciety, who are for interrupting me
in my Di&s;cour&s;e very often; but they had better open the Ca&s;ements of
their Bo|dies to let in Light to their Minds, as I do; for I always 
<Q> 
<L>Do much de&s;ire and long to know,</L> 
<L>The Wit that from Choice Spirits
flow.</L></Q> Mr. Pre&s;ident! I &s;ee your all-&s;ilencing Hammer is lifted up
to knock me <PB N="204" REF="216"> down; but I &s;hall ju&s;t de&s;ire to
relate a Fact, which I know to be true, of the public Crier at
<HI>Top&s;ham</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> which I con&s;ider as a very good
Piece of Eloquence. He had no le&s;s than ten Children; and they becoming
charge|able to the Pari&s;h, he was required by the Church-wardens to get no
more, and u&s;ed barbarou&s;ly for tho&s;e he had; whereupon he went into the
Market|place, took his Bell in his Hand, rung it, and then &s;aid, <HI>O
Yes!&mdash;O Yes!&mdash;O Yes!&mdash;This is to give Notice,</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>That when Breeches and Petticoats do come
near,</L> 
<L>Fle&s;h and Blood cannot forbear.</L></Q>
This was wielding the &s;acred Weapon, and making the Mu&s;e to flow, and I
think he acted right in all Re&s;pects; for Mr. POPE &s;ays, 
<Q> 
<L>The Goods of Fortune variou&s;ly are
giv'n;</L> 
<L>A Wife is the peculiar Gift of
Heav'n.</L></Q> He doesn't &s;ay two, Mr. Pre&s;ident. But I &s;ee the
uplifted, all-&s;ilencing Hammer again fills your Hand, and threatens my Head;
and therefore I <PB N="205" REF="217"> mu&s;t conclude. But, Mr. Pre&s;ident,
give me Leave to mention a bad Cu&s;|tom in this Society, which is to &s;hew
Marks of their <HI>Approbration</HI> or <HI>Di&s;|approbration:</HI> Now, Mr.
Pre&s;ident, I never clap the Speakers, for fear of p*x**g their
Under&s;tandings; and yet, I'll work, walk, or talk, as much for a Shilling, as
any Lawyer or Par&s;on in <HI>England</HI> will for a Guinea.</P>

<P>WITH this Character we &s;hall clo&s;e our Account of the
principal Speakers of the ROBINHOOD SOCIETY; an Account, that though written
without Embelli&s;hment, is not de&s;titute of Fidelity and Candour.
Un|influenced by any private Views, we have neither indulged Re&s;entment by
wanton Cen&s;ure, nor, for the Sake of per&s;onal At|tachments, pro&s;tituted
Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>OF the general Character of the Socie|ty, and its Influence on the
Minds of young Per&s;ons, little has been &s;aid: And while we were lately
ruminating on the Manner in which we &s;hould conclude this great Work, a
Friend, who had peru&s;ed our Manu&s;cript, came in; and, after knowing the
Subject of our Meditations, thus warmly expo&s;tulated upon it.</P>
<Q><PB N="206" REF="218"> 
<P> THERE can be no Doubt in what Light the Society mu&s;t appear
to every Mind, who&s;e Judgment is not determi|ned by Fancy and Pa&s;&s;ion,
but by the Nature and Tendency of Principles and Actions demon&s;trated by
Facts. From the Hi&s;tory you have given of the Socie|ty, it is evident, that
it maintained its U&s;efulne&s;s and Honour no longer, than while it faithfully
adhered to that fun|damental Law of its In&s;titution, by which all religious
Que&s;tions were excluded from the Subjects of Debate.</P> 
<P>WHEN, for the Diffu&s;ion of u&s;eful Knowledge, it was thought
expedient to admit every Per&s;on that cho&s;e to come, and, for that
Purpo&s;e, to a&s;&s;em|ble at a Public-Hou&s;e; if two or three Hours had been
&s;et apart for the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Night, and no eating drink|ing or
&s;moaking had been permitted in that Interval; and, if the Subjects of Debate
had been confined to the Trade and Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to
Natural Hi&s;tory, the Mathematics, and the Liberal Arts; how poorly would the
Meetings of the Society have been attended! Though its Credit might 
<PB N="207" REF="219"> have remained, its Number would not have been much
increa&s;ed. But, as &s;oon as it was known, that the Drunkard and the Glutton
might regale them|&s;elves at the Expence of the Temperate, and that every
illiterate Prater might di&s;play his Oratory, and &s;ignalize him|&s;elf as
the Champion of Dei&s;m or Chri|&s;tianity; the Society was immediately crowded
with noi&s;y Butchers, Tinkers, and Coblers; with &s;elf-conceited and
frontle&s;s Infidels; with tho&s;e not le&s;s profane, though more
incon&s;i&s;tent, <HI>Ari|ans</HI> and <HI>Socinians;</HI> and with the mo&s;t
contentious, and yet the wor&s;t Di&s;|puters about Chri&s;tianity,
<HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Antinomians.</HI> The fir&s;t Principles of
Religion, and the e&s;&s;ential Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, were called in
Que&s;tion every Night in the Pre&s;ence of young People, who unhappily
deviating in their Search after Truth and Goodne&s;s, were here betrayed into
Error, and &s;hut up from the Sight of That, by which alone Sin can be
de&s;troyed and Holine&s;s re|&s;tored.</P> 
<P>THE <HI>Book of Que&s;tions,</HI> as you have repre&s;ented it,
is it&s;elf a &s;ufficient Proof of the licentious and even wan|ton 
<PB N="208" REF="220"> Levity, with which the mo&s;t &s;acred Doctrines and
Characters have been treated: In the Specimen of Religious Que&s;tions which,
you &s;ay, you have &s;elected from that Book, there were two, which I was
compelled to &s;trike out, to &s;ave my&s;elf from being a Par|taker in the
Guilt of the mo&s;t horrid Bla&s;phemy. And he, who, by his Pre&s;ence, has
contributed to &s;upport a Society, in which &s;uch Que&s;tions are &s;uffered
to be propo&s;ed, regi&s;tered, and debated, has &s;o far contributed to the
Support of Profanene&s;s and Impiety. From this Charge I exempt not even THE
BAKER him&s;elf, who is intitled to no higher Honour from his long
Pre&s;ident&s;hip, than that of keeping a rude Multitude in &s;ome external
Order, and pre&s;erving the Regularity of an Infidel-Di&s;putation.</P> 
<P>MANY Things, indeed, are called Religion that do not belong to
it; but that which is e&s;&s;ential in Religion, is private and per&s;onal,
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting not in di&s;putable Notions and refined Ar|guments, but in the
Sen&s;ibilities and Perceptions of the Heart: For who, in his Sen&s;es, can
di&s;pute a Moment <PB N="209" REF="221"> whether he is a Sinner? and who, that
feels him&s;elf a Sinner, can di&s;pute a Moment whether he &s;hould receive or
reject the Pardon that is offered him? and who can depend upon the Pardon of
Sin, any further than he feels in his Heart a Principle di&s;approving,
di&s;|owning, re&s;i&s;ting and &s;ubduing the Power of Sin? And yet what is
more prevalent in all our <HI>Societies for Free Debate and Inquiry,</HI> than
the Folly and Madne&s;s of attempting to de&s;troy the&s;e Sen&s;ibilities, to
&s;tifle the&s;e Convictions, and to prove, by Logical Di&s;putation, that Man
is now as he was originally made; that he is, therefore, no Sin|ner; and that,
con&s;equently, he need|eth no Redeemer. But he, who abandons that penitential
and humbling Sen&s;e of Sin, and that endearing Sen&s;e of pardoning Mercy,
which the Chri|&s;tian Redemption awakens in every Heart; and endeavours to
per&s;uade him&s;elf, that he can be &s;et free from his Evil and Mi&s;ery, and
made good and happy, by Definitions, or Axioms, or Forms, or Sy&s;tems, or any
Thing le&s;s than the Renovation of a Divine Life; abandons that for which the 
<PB N="210" REF="222"> whole Creation cannot yield him a Recompence.</P> 
<P>OF the Nature and Tendency of all the&s;e <HI>Societies for free
Debate and In|quiry,</HI> the Writer of THE ADVEN|TURER has expre&s;&s;ed his
Sentiments with ju&s;t Indignation.</P> 
<P>NOTHING <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> has offended me more, than the
Manner in which Sub|jects of eternal Moment are often treat|ed. To di&s;pute on
Moral and Theological Topics, is become a Fa&s;hion; and it is u&s;ual with
Per&s;ons, of whom it is no Reproach to &s;ay they are ignorant, becau&s;e
their Opportunities of gaining Knowledge have been few, to deter|mine with the
utmo&s;t confidence upon Que&s;tions to which no human Intellect is equal. In
almo&s;t every Tavern and every Alehou&s;e, illiterate Petulance prates of
Fitne&s;s and Virtue, of Free|dom and Fate; and it is common to hear Di&s;putes
concerning everla&s;ting Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery, the My&s;teries of Religion
and the Attributes of GOD, intermingled with Lewdne&s;s and Bla&s;|phemy, or at
lea&s;t treated with wanton Negligence and ab&s;urd Merriment.</P> 
<P><PB N="211" REF="223"> FOR Lewdne&s;s and Bla&s;phemy, it is
hoped no Apology will &s;eriou&s;ly be of|fered: And it is probable, that if
the Que&s;tion in Debate was, which of the Di&s;putants &s;hould be hanged on
the Morrow, it would be conducted with Decency and Gravity, as a Matter of
&s;ome Importance: That vi&s;ible good Humour, and that noble Freedom, of which
they appear to be &s;o fond, would be thought not well to agree with their
Subject; nor would either of the Gen|tlemen be much delighted, if an Argu|ment
intended to demon&s;trate that he would, within a few Hours, be &s;u&s;|pended
on a Gibbet, &s;hould be embel|li&s;hed with a witty Allu&s;ion to a Button and
Loop, or a jocular Remark, that it would effectually &s;ecure him from future
Accidents, either by Land or Water: And yet the Ju&s;tice and Mercy of
OMNIPOTENCE, the Life and Death of the Soul, are treated with Ridicule and
Sport; and it is contended, that with Ridicule and Sport, they ought always to
be treated.</P> 
<P>BUT the Effect, as well as the Man|ner of tho&s;e fa&s;hionable
Di&s;putes, is <PB N="212" REF="224"> always ill: They tend to e&s;tabli&s;h
what is called Natural Religion, upon the Ruins of CHRISTIANITY; and a Man has
no &s;ooner &s;tiled him&s;elf a Moral Philo&s;opher, than he finds that his
Duty both to GOD and Man, is contracted into a very &s;mall Compa&s;s, and may
be practi&s;ed with the greate&s;t Facility. Yet, as this Effect is not always
appa|rent, the Unwary are frequently delu|ded into fatal Error, and imagine
they are attaining the highe&s;t Degree of Moral Excellence, while they are
in|&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;ing the Principles upon which alone Temptation can be
re&s;i&s;ted, and a &s;teady Per&s;everance in well-doing, &s;ecured.</P> 
<P>AMONG other favourite and un&s;u&s;|pected Topics, is the
EXCELLENCY OF VIRTUE. Virtue is &s;aid nece&s;&s;arily to produce its own
Happine&s;s, and to be con&s;tantly and adequately its own Reward; as Vice, on
the contrary, never fails to produce Mi&s;ery, and in|flict upon it&s;elf the
Puni&s;hment it de|&s;erves; Propo&s;itions, of which every one is ready to
affirm, that they may be admitted without Scruple, and be|lieved without
Danger. But from hence <PB N="213" REF="225"> it is inferred, that future
Rewards and Puni&s;hments are not nece&s;&s;ary, either to furni&s;h adequate
Motives to the Practice of Virtue, or to ju&s;tify the Ways of GOD: In
Con&s;equence of their being not nece&s;&s;ary, they become doubtful; the DEITY
is le&s;s and le&s;s the Object of Fear and Hope; and as Virtue is &s;aid to be
that which produces ultimate Good below, whatever is &s;up|po&s;ed to produce
ultimate Good below, is &s;aid to be Virtue: Right and wrong are confounded,
becau&s;e remote Con|&s;equences cannot perfectly be known; the principal
Barrier by which Appe|tite and Pa&s;&s;ion are re&s;trained, is broken down.
The Remon&s;trances of Con|&s;cience are overborne by Sophi&s;try; and the
acquired and habitual Shame of Vice is &s;ubdued by the perpetual Efforts of
vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the Expedients that have been found out to
alleviate the Mi&s;eries of Life, none is left to de&s;pair but Com|plaint: And
though Complaint, without Hope of Relief, may be thought rather to increa&s;e
than mitigate Angui&s;h, as it re|collects every Circum&s;tance of
Di&s;tre&s;s, and imbitters the Memory of pa&s;t Suffer|ings by the
Anticipation of future; yet, like weeping, it is an Indulgence of that which it
is Pain to &s;uppre&s;s, and &s;ooths with the Hope of Pity the Wretch who
de&s;pairs of Comfort. Of this Number is he who now addre&s;&s;es you: Yet the
Solace of Complaint and the Hope of Pity, are not the only Motives that have
induced <PB N="215" REF="227"> me to communicate the Series of Events, by which
I have been led on in an in&s;en&s;i|ble Deviation from Felicity, and at la&s;t
plunged in irremediable Calamity: I wi&s;h that others may e&s;cape Perdition;
and am, therefore, &s;olicitous to warn them of the Path, that leads to the
Precipice from which I have fallen.</P>
<P>I AM the only Child of a wealthy Farmer, who, as he was
him&s;elf illiterate, was the more zealous to make his Son a Scholar,
imagining, that there was in the Knowledge of Greek and Latin, &s;ome &s;e|cret
Charm of perpetual Influence, which, as I pa&s;&s;ed through Life, would
&s;mooth the Way before me, e&s;tabli&s;h the Happi|ne&s;s of Succe&s;s, and
&s;upply new Re&s;ources to Di&s;appointment. But not being able to deny
him&s;elf the Plea&s;ure he found in having me about him, in&s;tead of
&s;ending me out to a Boarding-School, he offered the Curate of the Pari&s;h
ten Pounds a Year and his Board, to become my Tutor.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman, who was in Years, and had lately buried
his Wife, accepted the Employment, but refu&s;ed the Salary: The Work of
Education, he &s;aid, would agreeably fill his Intervals of Lei&s;ure, and 
<PB N="216" REF="228"> happily coincide with the Duties of his Function: But he
ob&s;erved that his Cu|racy, which was thirty Pounds a Year, and had long
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted him when he had a Family, would make him wealthy now he was a
&s;ingle Man; and therefore he in&s;i&s;ted to pay for his Board: To this my
Father, with whatever Reluctance, was obliged to con&s;ent. At the Age of &s;ix
Years I began to read my Accidence under my Precep|tor, and at fifteen had gone
through the Latin and Greek Cla&s;&s;ics. But the Lan|guages were not all that
I learned of this Gentleman; be&s;ides other Science of le&s;s Importance, he
taught me the Theory of CHRISTIANITY by his Precepts, and the Practice by his
Example.</P>
<P>AS his Temper was calm and &s;teady, the Influence which
he had acquired over me, was unlimited: He was never capri|eiou&s;ly &s;evere;
&s;o that I regarded his Di&s;|plea&s;ure not as an Effect of his Infirmity,
but of my own Fault: He di&s;covered &s;o much Affection in the Plea&s;ure with
which he commended, and in the tender concern with which he reproved me, that I
loved him as a Father; and his Devotion, tho' rational and manly, was yet &s;o
habitual and fervent, that I reverenced him as a <PB N="217" REF="229"> Saint.
I found even my Pa&s;&s;ions con|trouled by an Awe which his Pre&s;ence
impre&s;&s;ed; and, by a con&s;tant Attention to his Doctrine and Life, I
acquired &s;uch a Sen&s;e of my Connexion with the invi&s;i|ble World, and
&s;uch a Conviction of the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of DEITY to all my Thoughts,
that every inordinate Wi&s;h was &s;ecretly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and my Conduct
regulated by the mo&s;t &s;crupulous circum|&s;pection.</P>
<P>MY Father thought he had now taken &s;ufficient Care of my
Education, and therefore began to expect that I &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in
overlooking his Servants, and ma|naging his Farm, in which he intended I
&s;hould &s;ucceed him: But my Preceptor, who&s;e principal View was not my
tem|poral Advantage, told him, that, as a Farmer, great Part of my Learning
would be totally u&s;ele&s;s; and that the only Way to make me &s;erviceable to
Mankind, in Proportion to the Knowledge I had ac|quired, would be to &s;end me
to the Uni|ver&s;ity, that at a proper Time I might take Orders. But my Father,
be&s;ides that he was &s;till unwilling to part with me, had probably many
Rea&s;ons again&s;t my entering the World in a Ca&s;&s;ock: Such, 
<PB N="218" REF="230"> however, was the Deference which he paid to my Tutor,
that he had almo&s;t im|plicitly &s;ubmitted to his Determination; when a
Relation of my Mother's, who was an Attorney of great Practice in the
<HI>Temple,</HI> came to &s;pend part of the long Vacation at our Hou&s;e, in
con&s;equence of Invitations which had been often repeated during an Ab&s;ence
of many Years.</P>
<P>MY Father thought that an Opportuni|ty of con&s;ulting how
to di&s;po&s;e of me with a man &s;o well acquainted with Life, was not to be
lo&s;t; and perhaps he &s;ecretly hoped, that my Preceptor would give up his
Opinion as indefen&s;ible, if a Per&s;on of the Lawyer's Experience &s;hould
declare again&s;t it. My Cou&s;in was accordingly made Umpire in the Debate;
and after he had heard the Arguments on both Sides, he declared again&s;t my
becoming a Farmer: He &s;aid it would be an Act of Inju&s;tice to bury my Parts
and Learning in the Ob|&s;curity of Rural Life; becau&s;e, if produ|ced to the
World, they would probably be rewarded with Wealth and Di&s;tinction. My
Preceptor imagined the Que&s;tion was now finally determined in his Favour; and
being obliged to vi&s;it one of his Pari|&s;hioners that was &s;ick, he gave me
a Look <PB N="219" REF="231"> of Congratulation as he went out, and I perceived
his Cheek glow with a Flu&s;h of Triumph, and his Eye &s;parkle with Tears of
Delight.</P>
<P>BUT he had no &s;ooner left the Room, than my Cou&s;in
gave the Conver&s;ation another Turn: He told my Father, that though he had
oppo&s;ed his making me a Farmer, he was not an Advocate for my becoming a
Par&s;on; for that, to make a young Fellow a Par&s;on, without being able to
procure him a Living, was to make him a Beggar. He then made &s;ome witty
Reflections on the old Gentleman who was ju&s;t gone out: 
<Q REND="inline">"Nobody <HI>(he &s;aid)</HI> could
que&s;tion his having been put to a bad Trade, who con&s;idered his
Circum|&s;tances now he had followed it forty Years."</Q> And after &s;ome
other &s;prightly Sallies, which, though they made my Fa|ther laugh, made me
tremble, he clapped him upon the Shoulder, 
<Q REND="inline">"If you have a Mind your Boy &s;hould make
a Figure in Life, old Gentleman, <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> put him Clerk to me: My
Lord Chancellor <HI>King</HI> was no better than the Son of a Country Shop
keeper; and my Ma&s;ter gave a Per&s;on of much greater Eminence many a
Half-crown, when he was an <PB N="220" REF="232"> Attorney's Clerk in the next
Chambers to mine. What &s;ay you? Shall I take him up with me or no?"</Q> My
Father, who had li&s;tened to this Propo&s;al with great Eagerne&s;s, as &s;oon
as my Cou&s;in had done &s;peaking, cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"A Match;"</Q> and im|mediately gave him
his Hand in Token of his Con&s;ent. Thus the Bargain was &s;truck, and my Fate
determined before my Tutor came back.</P>
<P>IT was in vain that he afterwards ob|jected to the
Character of my new Ma|&s;ter, and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t dreadful
Apprehen&s;ions at my becoming an Attor|ney's Clerk, and entering into the
Society of Wretches who had been repre&s;ented to him, and perhaps not
unju&s;tly, as the mo&s;t Profligate upon Earth: They do not, in|deed, become
wor&s;e than others, merely as Clerks; but as Per&s;ons who, with more Money to
&s;pend in the Gratification of Ap|petite, are &s;ooner than others abandoned
to their own Conduct: For, though they are taken from under the Protection of a
Parent, yet, being &s;carce con&s;idered as in a State of Servitude, they are
not &s;uffici|ently re&s;trained by the Authority of a Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="233"> MY Father had conceived of my
Cou&s;in as the be&s;t natured Man in the World, and, probably, was intoxicated
with the Romantic Hope of living to &s;ee me upon the Bench in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> or of meet|ing me upon the Circuit, lolling in
my own Coach, and attended by a Crowd of the inferior In&s;truments of
Ju&s;tice. He was not therefore to be moved, either by Expo&s;tulation or
Intreaty; and I &s;et out with my Cou&s;in on Hor&s;eback, to meet the Stage at
a Town within a few Miles, after having taken Leave of my Father, with a
Tenderne&s;s that melted us both; and received from the hoary Saint his la&s;t
In&s;tructions and Benediction, and at length the parting Embrace, which was
given with the &s;ilent Ardour of unutterable Wi&s;hes, and repeated with Tears
that could no lon|ger be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or concealed.</P>
<P>WHEN we were &s;eated in the Coach, my Cou&s;in began to
make him&s;elf merry with the Regret and Di&s;content that he perceived in my
Countenance, at leaving a Cow-hou&s;e, a Hog-&s;tye, and two old Grey-pates,
who were contending whether I &s;hould be buried in a Farm or a College. I, who
had never heard either my Father <PB N="222" REF="234"> or my Tutor treated
with Irreverence, could not conceal my Di&s;plea&s;ure and my Re&s;ent|ment:
But he &s;till continued to rally my Country Simplicity with many Allu&s;ions,
which I did not then under&s;tand, but which greatly delighted the re&s;t of
the Company. The fourth Day brought us to our Jour|ney's End; and my Ma&s;ter,
as &s;oon as we reached his Chambers, &s;hook me by the Hand, and bid me
welcome to the <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>HE had been &s;ome Years a Widower, and his only Child, a
Daughter, being &s;till at a Boarding-&s;chool, his Family con&s;i&s;ted only
of a Man and Maid Servant, and my|&s;elf; for, though he had two hired Clerks,
yet they lodged and boarded them&s;elves. The horrid Lewdne&s;s and
Profanene&s;s of the&s;e Fellows terrified and di&s;gu&s;ted me; nor could I
believe that my Ma&s;ter's Pro|perty and Intere&s;t could be &s;afely
intru&s;ted with Men who, in every Re&s;pect, appear|ed to be &s;o de&s;titute
of Virtue and Reli|gion: I therefore thought it my Duty to appri&s;e him of his
Danger; and accor|dingly one Day, when we were at Din|ner, I communicated my
Su&s;picion, and the Rea&s;on upon which it was founded. The formal Solemnity
with which I intro|duced this Conver&s;ation, and the Air of 
<PB N="223" REF="235"> importance which I gave to my Di&s;covery, threw him
into a violent Fit of Laughter, which &s;truck me dumb with Confu&s;ion and
A&s;toni&s;hment. As &s;oon as he recovered him&s;elf, he told me, that though
his Clerks might u&s;e &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions that I had not been accu&s;tomed
to hear, yet he believed them to be very hone&s;t; and that he placed more
Confidence in them, than he would in a formal Prig, of whom he knew nothing but
that he went every Morning and Evening to Prayers, and &s;aid Grace before and
after Meat; that, as to &s;wearing, they meant no Harm; and, as he did not
doubt but that every young Fellow liked a Girl, it was better they &s;hould
joke about it than be hypocri|tical and &s;ly: not that he would be thought to
&s;u&s;pect my Integrity, or to blame me for Practices which he knew to be
merely Effects of the Bigotry and Super&s;tition, in which I had been educated,
and not the Di&s;gui&s;es of Cunning, or the Subterfuges of Guilt.</P>
<P>I WAS greatly mortified at my Cou&s;in's Behaviour on this
Occa&s;ion, and wondered from what Cau&s;e it could proceed, and why he
&s;hould &s;o lightly pa&s;s over tho&s;e <PB N="224" REF="236"> Vices in
others, from which he ab&s;tained him&s;elf; for I had never heard him &s;wear;
and as his Expre&s;&s;ions were not ob&s;cene, I imagined his Conver&s;ation
was cha&s;te; in which, however, my Ignorance deceived me, and it was not long
before I had Rea&s;on to change my Opinion of his Character.</P>
<P>THERE came one Morning to enquire for him at his Chambers,
a Lady, who had &s;omething in her Manner which caught my Attention, and
excited my Curio&s;ity: Her Cloaths were fine, but the Manner in which they
were put on, was rather flaunting than elegant; her Addre&s;s was not ea&s;y
nor polite, but &s;eemed to be a &s;trange Mixture of affected State and
li|centious Familiarity: She looked in the Gla&s;s while &s;he was &s;peaking
to me, and without any Confu&s;ion adju&s;ted her Tucker; &s;he &s;eemed rather
plea&s;ed than di&s;concerted, at being regarded with Earne&s;tne&s;s; and
being told, that my Cou&s;in was abroad, &s;he a&s;ked &s;ome trifling
Que&s;tions, and then making a light Curt&s;ey, took up the Side of her Hoop
with a Jerk, that di&s;co|vered at lea&s;t half her Leg, and hurried down
Stairs.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="237"> I COULD not help enquiring of the
Clerks, if they knew this Lady; and was greatly confounded when they told me,
with an Air of Secrecy, that &s;he was my Cou&s;in's Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had
kept al|mo&s;t two Years in Lodgings near <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> At fir&s;t I
&s;u&s;pected this Infor|mation; but it was &s;oon confirmed by &s;o many
Circum&s;tances, that I could no longer doubt of its Truth.</P>
<P>AS my Principles were yet untainted, and the Influence of
my Education was &s;till &s;trong, I regarded my Cou&s;in's Senti|ments as
impious and dete&s;table; and his Example rather &s;truck me with Horror, than
&s;educed me to Imitation. I flattered my&s;elf with Hopes of effecting his
Refor|mation, and took every Opportunity to hint the Wickedne&s;s of allowed
Inconti|nence; for which I was always rallied when he was di&s;po&s;ed to be
merry, and an&s;wered with the contemptuous Sneer of Self-&s;ufficiency, when
he was &s;ullen.</P>
<P>NEAR four Years of my Clerk&s;hip were now expired, and I
had never yet entered the Li&s;ts as a Di&s;putant with my Cou&s;in: For tho' I
conceived my&s;elf to be much <PB N="226" REF="238"> his Superior in Moral and
Theological Learning; and though he often admitted me to familiar
Conver&s;ation, yet I &s;till regarded the Subordination of a Servant to a
Ma&s;ter, as one of the Duties of my Station, and pre&s;erved it with &s;uch
exact|ne&s;s, that I never exceeded a Que&s;tion or a Hint, when we were alone,
and was always &s;ilent when he had Company; tho' I frequently heard &s;uch
Pro&s;itions ad|vanced, as made me wonder that no tre|mendous Token of the
Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure immediately followed: But coming one Night from the
Tavern, warm with Wine, and, as I imagined, flu&s;hed with Polemic Succe&s;s,
he in&s;i&s;ted upon my ta|king one Gla&s;s with him before he went to Bed; and
almo&s;t as &s;oon as we were &s;eated, he gave me a formal Challenge, by
denying all DIVINE REVELATION, and defying me to prove it.</P>
<P>I NOW con&s;idered every Di&s;tinction as thrown down, and
&s;tood forth as the Champion of Religion, with that Elation of Mind which the
Hero always feels at the Approach of Danger. I thought my|&s;elf &s;ecure of
Victory; and rejoicing that he had now compelled me to do what I had often
wi&s;hed he would permit, I obliged <PB N="227" REF="239"> him to declare that
he would di&s;pute upon equal Terms, and we began the Debate. But it was not
long before I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find my&s;elf confounded by a Man, whom I
&s;aw half drunk, and who&s;e Learning and Abilities I de&s;pi&s;ed when he was
&s;ober; for as I had but very lately di&s;covered, that any of the Principles
of Religion, from the Immortality of the Soul to the deepe&s;t My&s;tery, had
been &s;o much as que&s;tioned, all his Objections were new. I was
a&s;|&s;aulted where I had made no Preparation for Defence; and having not been
&s;o much accu&s;tomed to Di&s;putation, as to con&s;ider, that in the
pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s of Human Intellects, it is much ea&s;ier to object than to
an&s;wer, and that in every Di&s;qui&s;ition, Difficulties are found which
cannot be re|&s;olved, I was overborne by the &s;udden On&s;et, and in the
Tumult of my Search after An&s;wers to his Cavils, forgot to pre&s;s the
po&s;itive Arguments on which Religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed: He took Advantage of
my Confu&s;ion, proclaimed his own Triumph, and, becau&s;e I was depre&s;&s;ed,
treated me as vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>As the Event which had thus mortified my Pride, was
perpetually revolved in my Mind, the &s;ame Mi&s;take &s;till continued: 
<PB N="228" REF="240"> I enquired for Solutions in&s;tead of Proofs, and found
my&s;elf more and more en|tangled in the Snares of Sophi&s;try. In &s;ome other
Conver&s;ations which my Cou&s;in was now eager to begin, new Difficulties were
&s;tarted, the Labyrinth of Doubt grew more intricate, and as the Que&s;tion
was of infinite Moment, my Mind was brought into the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful
Anxiety. I ru|minated ince&s;&s;antly on the Subjects of our Debate,
&s;ometimes chiding my&s;elf for my Doubts, and &s;ometimes applauding the
Courage and Freedom of my Enquiry.</P>
<P>WHILE my Mind was in this State, I heard by Accident that
there was a Club at an Alehou&s;e in the Neighbourhood, where &s;uch Subjects
were freely debated, to which every Body was admitted with|out Scruple or
Formality: To this Club in an evil Hour I re&s;olved to go, that I might learn
how knotty Points were to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and Truth di&s;tingui&s;hed from
Error.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, on the next Club-Night, I mingled with the
Multitude that was a&s;&s;embled in this School of Folly and Infidelity: I was
at fir&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted at the gro&s;s Ignorance of &s;ome, and &s;hocked at 
<PB N="229" REF="241"> the horrid Bla&s;phemy of others; but Cu|rio&s;ity
prevailed, and my Sen&s;ibility by Degrees wore off. I found that almo&s;t
every Speaker had a different Opinion, which &s;ome of them &s;upported by
Argu|ments, that to me, who was utterly un|acquainted with Di&s;putation,
appeared to hold oppo&s;ite Probabilities in exact Equi|poi&s;e; &s;o that,
in&s;tead of being confirmed in any Principle, I was dive&s;ted of all; the
Perplexity of my Mind was increa&s;ed, and I contracted &s;uch a Habit of
que&s;tion|ing whatever offered to my Imagination, that I almo&s;t doubted of
my own Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IN Proportion as I was le&s;s a&s;&s;ured in my
Principles, I was le&s;s circum&s;pect in my Conduct: But &s;uch was &s;till
the Force of Education, that any gro&s;s Violence offered to that which I had
held &s;acred, and every Act which I had been u&s;ed to regard as incurring the
Forfeiture of the DIVINE FAVOUR, &s;tung me with Re|mor&s;e. I was, indeed,
&s;till re&s;trained from flagitious Immorality, by the Power of Habit: But
this Power grew weaker and weaker, and the natural Propen&s;ity to Ill
gradually took Place, as the Motion that is communicated to a Ball which is
&s;truck up into the Air, becomes every <PB N="230" REF="242"> Moment le&s;s
and le&s;s, 'till at Length it recoils by its own Weight.</P>
<P>FEAR and Hope, the great Springs of Human Action, had now
lo&s;t their princi|pal Objects, as I doubted whether the Enjoyment of the
pre&s;ent Moment was not all that I could &s;ecure; my Power to re&s;i&s;t
Temptation dimini&s;hed with my De|pendance upon the GRACE OF GOD, and Regard
to the Sanction of his Law; and I was fir&s;t &s;educed by a Pro&s;titute, in
my Return from a Declamation on the BEAUTY of Virtue, and the Strength of the
MORAL SENSE.</P>
<P>I BEGAN now to give my&s;elf up intirely to Sen&s;uality,
and the Gratification of Ap|petite terminated my Pro&s;pects of Felicity. That
Peace of Mind, which is the Sun|&s;hine of the Soul, was exchanged for the
Gloom of Doubt, and the Storm of Pa&s;|&s;ion; and my Confidence in GOD, and
Hope of everla&s;ting Joy, for &s;udden Ter|rors and vain Wi&s;hes, the
Loathings of Satiety, and the Angui&s;h of Di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>I WAS, indeed, impatient under this Fluctuation of
Opinion, and therefore I <PB N="231" REF="243"> applied to a Gentleman, who was
a prin|cipal Speaker at the Club, and deemed a profound Philo&s;opher, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Labours of my own Mind in the Inve&s;tigation of Truth, and
relieve me from Di&s;traction by removing my Doubts: But this Gen|tleman,
in&s;tead of admini&s;tring Relief, la|mented the Prejudice of Education, which
he &s;aid hindered me from yielding without Re&s;erve to the Force of Truth,
and might perhaps always keep my mind anxious, though my Judgment &s;hould be
convinced. But as the mo&s;t effectual Remedy for this deplorable Evil, he
recommended to me the Works of CHUBB, MORGAN, and many others, which I procured
and read with great Eagerne&s;s; and though I was not at la&s;t a &s;ound
Dei&s;t, yet I perceived with &s;ome Plea&s;ure, that my Stock of Polemic
Knowledge was greatly increa&s;ed; &s;o that, in&s;tead of being an Auditor, I
commenced a Speaker at the Club: And though to &s;tand up and babble to a Crowd
at an Alehou&s;e, 'till Silence is commanded by the Stroke of a Hammer, is as
low an Ambition as can taint the human Mind; yet I was much elevated by my new
Di|&s;tinction, and plea&s;ed with the Deference that was paid to my Judgment.
I &s;ome|times, indeed, reflected, that I was pro|pagating 
<PB N="232" REF="244"> Opinions, by which I had my&s;elf become vicious and
wretched: But it im|mediately occurred, that though my Con|duct was changed, it
could not be proved that my Virtue was le&s;s, becau&s;e many Things which I
avoided as vicious upon my old Principles, were innocent upon my new. I
therefore went on in my Ca|reer, and was perpetually racking my In|vention for
new Topics and Illu&s;trations; and among other Expedients, as well to advance
my reputation, as to quiet my Con&s;cience, and deliver me from the Torment of
Remor&s;e, I thought of the following.</P>
<P>HAVING learned that all Error is inno|cent, becau&s;e it
is involuntary, I concluded that nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the
Mind, than to prove that all Vice was Error: I therefore formed the follow|ing
Argument: 
<Q REND="inline">"No Man becomes vi|cious, but from a
Belief that Vice will confer Happine&s;s: He may, indeed, have been told the
contrary; but im|plicit Faith is not required of rea&s;onable Beings:
Therefore, as every Man ought to &s;eek Happine&s;s, every Man may law|fully
make the Experiment: If he is di&s;appointed, it is plain that he did not 
<PB N="233" REF="245"> intend that which has happened; &s;o that every Vice is
an Error, and there|fore no Vice will be puni&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>I COMMUNICATED this ingenious Con|trivance to my Friend
the Philo&s;opher, who, in&s;tead of detecting the Difference between Ignorance
and Perver&s;ene&s;s, or &s;tating the Limitations within which we are bound to
&s;eek our own Happine&s;s, applauded the Acutene&s;s of my Penetra|tion, and
the Force of my Rea&s;oning. I was impatient to di&s;play &s;o novel and
im|portant a Di&s;covery to the Club, and the Attention that it drew upon me,
gratified my Ambition to the utmo&s;t of my Ex|pectation. I had, indeed, &s;ome
Oppo|nents; but they were &s;o little &s;killed in Argumentation, and &s;o
ignorant of the Subject, that it only rendered my Conque&s;t more &s;ignal and
important; for the Chair|man &s;ummed up the Arguments on both Sides, with &s;o
exact and &s;crupulous an Impartiality, that as I appeared not to have been
confuted, tho&s;e who could not di&s;cover the Weakne&s;s of my Antagoni&s;ts,
thought that to confute me was impo&s;&s;ible; my Sophi&s;try was taken for
Demon&s;tration, and the Number of Pro&s;elytes was incredi|ble. The
A&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of <PB N="234" REF="246"> Clerks and
Apprentices, young Per&s;ons who had received a religious, though not a liberal
Education; for tho&s;e who were totally ignorant, or wholly abandoned, troubled
not them&s;elves with &s;uch Di&s;pu|tations as were carried on at our Club:
And the&s;e unhappy Boys, the Impetuo&s;ity of who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions was
re&s;trained chiefly by Fear, as Virtue had not yet become a Habit, were glad
to have the Shackles &s;truck off, which they were told Prie&s;tcraft had put
on.</P>
<P>BUT however I might &s;atisfy others, I was not yet
&s;atisfied my&s;elf; my Torment returned, and new Opiates became
nece&s;|&s;ary: They were not, indeed, ea&s;ily to be found; but &s;uch was my
good Fortune, that an illiterate Mechanic afforded me a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable
Relief, 
<Q REND="inline">"by di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the important
Que&s;tion, and demon&s;trating that the Soul was not, nor could be
immortal."</Q> I was, indeed, di&s;po&s;ed to believe without the &s;evere&s;t
Scrutiny, what I now began &s;ecretly to wi&s;h; for &s;uch was the State of my
Mind, that I was willing to give up the Hope of ever|la&s;ting Happine&s;s, to
be delivered from the Dread of perpetual Mi&s;ery; and as I thought of dying as
a remote Event, the <PB N="235" REF="247"> Apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing my
Exi&s;tence with my Life, did not much interrupt the Plea|&s;ures of the Bagnio
and the Tavern.</P>
<P>THEY were, however, interrupted by another Cau&s;e; for I
contracted a Di&s;tem|per, which alarmed and terrified me, in Proportion as its
Progre&s;s was &s;wift, and its Con&s;equences were dreadful. In this
Di&s;tre&s;s, I applied to a young Surgeon, who was a Speaker at the Club, and
gained a genteel Sub&s;i&s;tence by keeping it in Repair: He treated my
Complaint as a Trifle; and to prevent any &s;erious Re|flections in this
Interval of Pain and Soli|tude, he rallied the deplorable Length of my
Countenance, and exhorted me to behave like a Man.</P>
<P>MY Pride, rather than my Fear, made me very &s;olicitous
to conceal this Di&s;order from my Cou&s;in; but he &s;oon di&s;covered it
rather with Plea&s;ure than Anger, as it compleated his Triumph, and afforded
him a new Subject of Raillery and Merri|ment. By the Spiritual and Corporeal
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Surgeon, I was at Length re&s;tored to my Health, with
the &s;ame di&s;&s;olute Morals, and a Re&s;olution to pur|&s;ue 
<PB N="236" REF="248"> my plea&s;ures with more Caution: In|&s;tead, therefore,
of hiring a Pro&s;titute, I now endeavoured to &s;educe the Virgin, and corrupt
the Wife.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Attempts my new Principles afforded me great
A&s;&s;i&s;tance: For I found that tho&s;e whom I could convert, I could
ea&s;ily debauch; and that to convert many, nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than
to advance my Principles, and allege &s;omething in Defence of them, by which I
appeared to be convinced my&s;elf; for not being able to di&s;pute, they
thought that the Argument which had convinced me, would, if they could
under&s;tand it, convince them: So that, by yielding an implicit A&s;&s;ent,
they at once paid a Compliment to their own Judgment, and &s;moothed the Way to
the Indulgence of Appetite.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus gratifying every in|ordinate De&s;ire,
and pa&s;&s;ing from one De|gree of Guilt to another, my Cou&s;in de|termined
to take his Daughter, who was now in her nineteenth Year, from School; and as
he intended to make her Mi&s;tre&s;s of his Family, he quitted his Chambers,
and took a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="249"> THIS young Lady I had frequently
&s;een, and always admired; &s;he was therefore no &s;ooner come home, than I
endeavoured to recommend my&s;elf by a thou&s;and A&s;&s;idui|ties, and
rejoiced in the many Opportuni|ties that were afforded me to entertain her
alone, and perceived that &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed with my Company, nor
in&s;en&s;i|ble to my Complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>MY Cou&s;in, though he had &s;een the Effects of his
Documents of Infidelity in the Corruption of my Morals, yet could not forbear
to &s;neer at Religion in the Pre&s;ence of his Daughter; a Practice in which I
now always concurred, as it faci|litated the Execution of a De&s;ign that I had
formed of rendering her &s;ub&s;ervient to my Plea&s;ures. I might, indeed,
have married her, and, perhaps, my Cou&s;in &s;ecretly intended that I
&s;hould: But I knew Women too well to think that Marriage would confine my
Wi&s;hes to a &s;ingle Object; and I was utterly aver&s;e to a State in which
the Plea&s;ure of Variety mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to dome&s;tic Quiet, or
dome&s;tic Quiet to the Plea&s;ure of Variety; for I neither imagined that I
could long in|dulge my&s;elf in an unlawful Familiarity <PB N="238" REF="250">
with many Women, before it would by &s;ome Accident be di&s;covered to my Wife;
nor that &s;he would be &s;o very courteous or philo&s;ophical, as to &s;uffer
this Indulgence without Expo&s;tulation and Clamour; and be&s;ides, I had no
Liking to a Brood of Children, who&s;e Wants would &s;oon be|come importunate,
and who&s;e Claim to my Indu&s;try and Frugality, would be uni|ver&s;ally
acknowledged; though the Off|&s;pring of a Mi&s;tre&s;s might be abandoned to
Beggary, without Breach of the Law, or Offence to Society.</P>
<P>THE young Lady, on the contrary, as &s;he perceived that
my Addre&s;&s;es exceeded common Civilities, did not que&s;tion but that my
View was to obtain her for a Wife; and I could di&s;cern that &s;he often
expected &s;uch a Declaration, and &s;eemed di&s;appoin|ted that I had not yet
propo&s;ed an Appli|cation to her Father: But imagining, I &s;uppo&s;e, that
the&s;e Circum&s;tances were only delayed 'till the fitte&s;t Opportunity,
&s;he did not &s;cruple to admit all the Free|doms that were con&s;i&s;tent
with Mode&s;ty; and I drew every Day nearer to the Ac|compli&s;hment of my
De&s;ign by in&s;en&s;ible Approaches, without alarming her Fear, or confirming
her Hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="251"> I KNEW that only two Things were
nece&s;&s;ary; her Pa&s;&s;ions were to be inflam'd, and the Motives from which
they were to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, removed. I was there|fore perpetually
in&s;inuating, that nothing which was natural, could be ill; I com|plained of
the Impo&s;itions and Re&s;traints of Prie&s;tcraft and Super&s;tition; and, as
if the&s;e Hints were ca&s;ual and accidental, I would immediately afterwards
&s;ing a ten|der Song, repeat &s;ome &s;educing Ver&s;es, or read a Novel.</P>
<P>BUT, henceforward, let never in&s;ulted Beauty admit a
&s;econd Time into her Pre|&s;ence the Wretch, who has once attemp|ted to
ridicule Religion, and &s;ub&s;titute other Aids to human Frailty, for that 
<Q REND="inline">"Love of GOD which is better than
Life,"</Q> and that Fear 
<Q REND="inline">"which is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom:"</Q>
For whoever makes &s;uch an Attempt, intends to betray; the contrary Conduct
being without Que|&s;tion the Intere&s;t of every one who&s;e Inten|tions are
good, becau&s;e even tho&s;e who profanely deny Religion to be of DIVINE
Origin, do yet acknowledge that it is a Political In&s;titution, well
calculated to &s;trengthen the Band of Society, and to <PB N="240" REF="252">
keep out the Ravager, by intrenching In|nocence and arming Virtue. To oppo&s;e
the&s;e Corrupters by Argument rather than Contempt, is to parley with a
Murderer, who may be excluded by &s;hutting a Door.</P>
<P>MY Cou&s;in's Daughter u&s;ed frequently to di&s;pute with
me, and the&s;e Di&s;putes always favoured the Execution of my Pro|ject:
Though, le&s;t I &s;hould alarm her too much, I often affected to appear half
in Je&s;t; and when I ventured to take any Liberty, by which the Bounds of
Mo|de&s;ty were &s;omewhat invaded, I &s;uddenly de&s;i&s;ted with an Air of
ea&s;y Negligence; and as the Attempt was not pur&s;ued, and nothing farther
&s;eemed to be intended than was done, it was regarded but as Wag|gery, and
puni&s;hed only with a Slap or a Frown. Thus &s;he became familiar with
Infidelity and Indecency by Degrees.</P>
<P>I ONCE &s;ubtily engaged her in a Debate, whether the
Gratification of natural Ap|petites was in it&s;elf innocent, and whether, if
&s;o, the Want of external Ceremony could in any Ca&s;e render it criminal. I
in&s;i&s;ted that Virtue and Vice were not influenced by external Ceremonies,
nor founded upon human Laws, which were <PB N="241" REF="253"> arbitrary,
temporary, and local: And that as a young Lady's &s;hutting her&s;elf up in a
Nunnery, was &s;till evil, though en|joined by &s;uch Laws; &s;o the
tran&s;mitting her Beauty to Po&s;terity was &s;till good, though under certain
Circum&s;tances it had by &s;uch Laws been forbidden. This &s;he affected
utterly to deny, and I propo&s;ed that the Que&s;tion &s;hould be referred to
her Papa, without informing him of our De|bate, and that it &s;hould be
determined by his Opinion; a Propo&s;al to which &s;he readily agreed. I
immediately adverted to other Subjects, as if I had no Intere&s;t in the
I&s;&s;ue of the Debate; but I could per|ceive that it &s;unk deeply into her
Mind, and that &s;he continued more thoughtful than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>I DID not fail, however, to introduce a &s;uitable Topic
of Di&s;cour&s;e the next Time my Cou&s;in was pre&s;ent, and having &s;tated
the Que&s;tion in general Terms, he gave it in my Favour, without
&s;u&s;pecting that he was Judge in his own Cau&s;e; and the next Time I was
alone with his Daughter, without mentioning his Deci|&s;ion, I renewed my
Familiarity; I found her Re&s;i&s;tance le&s;s re&s;olute, pur&s;ued my
Advantage, and compleated her Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="254"> WITHIN a few Months &s;he perceived
that &s;he was with Child; a Circum&s;tance that &s;he communicated to me with
Expre&s;|&s;ions of the mo&s;t piercing Di&s;tre&s;s: But in&s;tead of
con&s;enting to marry her, to which &s;he had often urged me with all the
little Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;he could practice, I made Light of the
Affair, chid her for being &s;o much alarmed for &s;o trivial an Accident, and
propo&s;ed a Medicine which I told her would effectually prevent the
Di&s;covery of our Intercour&s;e, by de|&s;troying the Effect of it before it
could appear. At this Propo&s;ition &s;he fainted, and when &s;he recovered,
oppo&s;ed it with Terror and Regret, with Tears, Trem|bling and Intreaty: But I
continued in|flexible, and at Length either removed or over-ruled her Scruples,
by the &s;ame Argu|ments that had fir&s;t &s;educed her to Guilt.</P>
<P>THE long Vacation was now commen|ced, and my Clerk&s;hip
was ju&s;t expired: I therefore propo&s;ed to my Cou&s;in, that we &s;hould all
make a Vi&s;it to my Father, hoping that the Fatigue of the Journey would
favour my Purpo&s;e, by increa&s;ing the Effect of the Medicine, and
account|ing for an Indi&s;po&s;ition which it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to
cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="255"> THE Plan being thus concerted, and
my Cou&s;in's Concurrence being obtained, it was immediately put in Execution.
I applied to my old Friend the Club Surgeon, to whom I made no Secret of &s;uch
Affairs, and he immediately furni&s;hed me with Medicaments, which he
a&s;&s;ured me would an&s;wer my Purpo&s;e; but either by a Mi|&s;take in the
Preparation, or in the Quan|tity, they produced a Di&s;order, which, &s;oon
after the dear injured unhappy Girl arrived at her Journey's End, terminated in
her Death.</P>
<P>MY Confu&s;ion and Remor&s;e at this Event, are not to be
expre&s;&s;ed: but Con|fu&s;ion and Remor&s;e were &s;uddenly changed into
A&s;toni&s;hment and Terror; for &s;he was &s;carce dead before I was taken
into Cu&s;tody, upon Su&s;picion of Murder. Her Father had depo&s;ed, that
ju&s;t before &s;he died, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with him in pri|vate; and
that then, taking his Hand, and intreating his Forgivene&s;s, &s;he told him
that &s;he was with Child by me, and that I had poi&s;oned her, under Pretence
of pre&s;erving her Reputation.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="256"> WHETHER &s;he made this
Declaration, or only confe&s;&s;ed the Truth, and her Fa|ther, to revenge the
Injury, had forged the re&s;t, cannot now be known; but the Coroner having been
&s;ummoned, the Body viewed, and found to have been pregnant, with many Marks
of a violent and un|common Di&s;order, a Verdict of Wilful Murder was brought
in again&s;t me, and I was committed to the County Gaol.</P>
<P>AS the Judges were then upon the Circuit, I was within
le&s;s than a Fort|night convicted and condemned by the Zeal of the Jury,
who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions had been &s;o greatly inflamed by the Enormity of the
Crime with which I had been charged, that they were rather willing that I
&s;hould &s;uffer being innocent, than that I &s;hould e&s;cape being guilty;
but it appearing to the Judge, in the Cour&s;e of the Trial, that Murder was
not intended, he reprieved me before he left the Town.</P>
<P>I MIGHT now have redeemed the Time, and, awakened to a
Sen&s;e of my Folly and my Guilt, might have made &s;ome Repara|tion to Mankind
for the Injury which I had <PB N="245" REF="257"> done to Society; and
endeavoured to re|kindle &s;ome Spark of Hope in my own Brea&s;t, by Repentance
and Devotion. But, alas! in the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of my Mind, upon &s;o
&s;udden and unexpected a Calamity, the Fear of Death yielded to the Fear of
Infamy, and I &s;wallowed Poi&s;on: The Exce&s;s of my De&s;peration hindered
its immediate Effect; for, as I took too much, great Part of it was thrown up,
and only &s;uch a Quantity re|mained behind, as was &s;ufficient to in&s;ure my
De&s;truction, and yet leave me Time to contemplate the Horrors of the Gulph
into which I am &s;inking.</P>
<P>IN this deplorable Situation I have been vi&s;ited by the
Surgeon, who was the im|mediate In&s;trument of my Misfortune, and the
Philo&s;opher who directed my Stu|dies: But the&s;e are Friends who only rouze
me to keener Sen&s;ibility, and inflict upon me more exqui&s;ite Torment. They
reproach me with Folly, and upbraid me with Cowardice; they tell me too, that
the Fear of Death has made me regret the Errors of Super&s;tition; but what
would I now give for tho&s;e erroneous Hopes, and that credulous Simplicity,
which, though I have been taught to de&s;pi&s;e them, would 
<PB N="246" REF="258"> &s;u&s;tain me in the tremendous Hour that approaches,
and avert from my la&s;t Agony the Horrors of De&s;pair.</P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, a Vi&s;iter of another Kind, the good old
Man who fir&s;t taught me to frame a Prayer, and fir&s;t animated me with the
Hope of Heaven; but he can only lament with me, that this Hope will not return,
and that I can pray with Confidence no more: He cannot, by a &s;udden Miracle,
re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Principles which I have &s;ubverted. My Mind is all Doubt,
and Terror, and Confu&s;ion; I know nothing but that I have rendered
in|effectual the Clemency of my JUDGE, that the Approach of Death is &s;wift
and inevitable, and that either the Shades of Everla&s;ting Night, or the
Gleams of un|quenchable Fire are at Hand. My Soul, in vain, &s;hrinks
backwards: I grow giddy with the Thought: The next Moment is Di&s;traction!
Farewell.</P>
