<HEAD>The Te&s;timony of Mr. Samuel Bor&s;et, &s;ometime Fellow of King's College in Cambridge, and a very intimate Acquaintance of Mr. John Janeway's.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY own e&s;teem of the &s;ingle weight of that Te&s;timony expected from me concerning my dear brother, on the account of my intimacy with him in King's College (the known memorable pa&s;|&s;ages of who&s;e exemplary life and death are now happily compiled and publi&s;hed for your &s;pecial peru&s;al) moves me to call in a twofold recommen|dation thereof from you to tho&s;e that knew him not, who, being confirmed in the truth of this nar|rative, may thereby be won to believe, admire, and emulate the &s;ignal grace of God in him.</P>
<P N="1">1. That remembring &s;o much thereof your&s;elves, and what opportunity I had of knowing the cer|tainty of all, you would a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e who may en|quire of you. That the impartial compiler hath kept within the bounds of truth and &s;obriety in pro&s;ecu|tion of his hone&s;t aims, to advance the glory of God's rich mercy to this cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, and by reviving what remains he could collect of this burning as well as &s;hining light (alas, how &s;oon extinct! to a|waken and quicken the formal profe&s;&s;ors, if he may not induce the profane &s;coffer of this age to a more &s;erious &s;tudy, and improvement of tho&s;e invi&s;ible realities, the clear evidence and powerful influence whereof our good friend did &s;o abundantly expe|rience. The truth is, the tran&s;criber (though be&s;t accompli&s;hed, and mo&s;t inwardly acquainted with what might conduce thereto) doth not but fall &s;hort of declaring the tran&s;cendent excellencies of this &s;u|blime &s;oul and precious &s;aint, which (till toward his end, when his heart was too full to hold in what could be uttered) were much concealed even to tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, by rea&s;on of his great humi|lity
<PB N="3" REF="3">and mode&s;ty. The&s;e di&s;po&s;ed him rather to receive than communicate, except where he had no expectation of the former, and either familiar inter|cour&s;e engaged, or the apprehending exigency of tho&s;e his heart was drawn out to in Chri&s;tian love and compa&s;&s;ion, con&s;trained to the latter. Yet many of tho&s;e precious &s;treams that did flow from him we mu&s;t lament the lo&s;s of, through default of careful recei|vers or faithful retainers. He was of clear intellec|tuals, and a large heart, both for craving and com|prehending what was worthy his pur&s;uit: Which being happily improved by his education, and time|ly &s;ea&s;oned with a &s;piritual favour of go&s;pel-my&s;te|ries (for obtaining of which he had then, with o|thers, choice advantages) was a great help to his proficiency in acquaintance with the vital exerci&s;es and &s;oul-&s;atisfying enjoyments of the divine life, a|bove not only his equals, but &s;eniors and in&s;tructors. He was much di&s;&s;atisfied with him&s;elf under any decays or abatements, till he could (if not alone, by imploring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;tian friends) reco|ver what he &s;ometime had had &s;uch &s;weet experience of. And, not content with any attainments, was &s;till pre&s;&s;ing unto what his pro&s;pect in the promi&s;es, encouraged by his happy prelibation a&s;&s;ured him was attainable. He was to this end a chearful embracer and diligent improver of &s;piritual opportunity, exact in his Chri&s;tian watch much wre&s;tling (and ve|ry prevalent) with God in prayer, and with him|&s;elf in his &s;olitudes, &s;triving to di&s;entangle his heart from what might divert his holy ambition, and to rai&s;e it to the highe&s;t activity and capacity for glori|fying and enjoying God in Chri&s;t, for the excellency of the knowledge of whom he accounted all inferior attainments but lo&s;s. What he had ta&s;ted and &s;een, he was grieved to &s;ee others neglect, de&s;irous to bring others to experience, by earne&s;tly commending them to God, de&s;igning with him&s;elf, contriving with hi &s;piritual confidence what might conduce thereto.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">He had a true &s;ympathy with tho&s;e that were bound with him heaven ward. Their pre&s;&s;ures and conflicts were his burden; his prayers and coun|&s;els their ready a&s;&s;i&s;tants; their refre&s;hments his revivings, and their &s;piritual proficiency his joy.</P>
<P>He was a &s;ecret and compa&s;&s;ionate mourner; as in general for the world's degeneracy, pretended Chri&s;tians unthankfulne&s;s for the go&s;pel, the ha|zard run by innumerable precious &s;ouls; &s;o e&s;pe|cially for the dreadful apo&s;ta&s;ies of &s;ome, the then threatning decay and growing formality of others, &s;ometime &s;eemingly forwards; which brought him nigher to God, and more inflamed his holy zeal. But this chiefly was carried out to advance the pow|er of religion in the families and per&s;ons he was peculiarly related to; apprehending there to lay his be&s;t opportunities, as well as &s;tronge&s;t obligations. And his &s;ucce&s;s was very encouraging.</P>
<P>This is part of what I knew of him at Cambridge, who refer you, for farther reviving your remem|brance, to the narrative. But both his &s;piritual receipts and experiences were much increa&s;ed the two la&s;t years of his life, when I had not oppor|tunity of per&s;onal conver&s;e with him. And by rea|&s;on of our di&s;tance (and at that time ignorance of his weak condition) I was not &s;o happy as to &s;hare in the privilege of tho&s;e who had the conveniency of receiving his la&s;t and &s;weete&s;t breath. Though I &s;oon after had the account (while things were fre&s;h in their memories, and warm on their hearts) from the eye and ear-witne&s;&s;es, that &s;ome of them have now been induced to make more public. But next and chiefly:</P>
<P N="2">2. I intreat you to recommend the truth of this narrative, by your faithful adhering to, and dili|gent promoting of, what &s;ome of you learned from him, and others profe&s;&s;ed with him; that by inti|mating his good example, and improving his expe|riences with your longer opportunities, you may be
<PB N="5" REF="5">&s;uch proficients in Chri&s;tianity, as &s;hining like lights your&s;elves, to hold forth the word of life for con|vincing the incredulous: That the my&s;teries of re|generation, a life of faith in Chri&s;t, the fruitful im|provement of union and communion with him to a pro&s;picious conformity to him, crucifixion to the world by his cro&s;s, and a conver&s;ation with him in heaven while on earth (therein propo&s;ed, herein exemplified) be no figments, but great realities; no &s;light matters, but of greate&s;t con&s;equence; not &s;uch &s;ingularities, but that others according to their mea&s;ures, taking the like cour&s;e, may be experimen|tally acquainted with the &s;urpa&s;&s;ing &s;weetne&s;s of an intere&s;t therein. And the rather am I bold to intreat this of you, becau&s;e I was privy to his &s;oul's concern for the concernment of your &s;ouls; how pa&s;&s;ionate|ly he de&s;ired to &s;ee Chri&s;t formed in you, and re|joiced at any evidence thereof; how earne&s;tly he would pray for you all, and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e he had more occa&s;ion to deal with, or cau&s;e to be jea|lous of; how affected he was with your dangers and &s;nares; and what a de&s;ire he had you might out|&s;trip him&s;elf, who could not take up his re&s;t on this &s;ide heaven. The good Lord help <HI>every one of us to &s;hew the &s;ame diligence to the full a&s;&s;urance of hope to the end, that we may not be &s;lothful, but followers of them who by faith and patience inherit the promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>I have one farther reque&s;t, That you would pur|&s;ue by your mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplications the de&s;ign of publi&s;hing this narrative, that God would make it pro&s;perous to the pious ends therein propo&s;ed, and for which I hope by his providence it is re&s;erved now for public view. E&s;pecially, that it may provoke to holy emulation, not only tho&s;e who were more pe|culiarly endeared to our precious friend by natural or &s;piritual bonds (and that, if any of the&s;e be fallen from their fir&s;t love, they may be excited to repent, to do their fir&s;t works, and &s;trengthen the things that remain; le&s;t, having begun in the &s;pirit, they

<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Can a&s;&s;ure thee from my own knowledge, that this Mr. John Janeway was an excellent per&s;on, in re&s;pect of his natural parts, acquired gifts, and divine graces, wherewith his heavenly Father adorn|ed him, con&s;idering his age, even far above the or|dinary rate of the be&s;t &s;ort of &s;cholars and Chri&s;ti|ans. All which he exceedingly improved for the good of others (e&s;pecially his near relations) both in health and &s;ickne&s;s, even to the la&s;t hour of his life. And, when the immediate fore-runners of death were upon him, he &s;o acted faith and hope, &s;o lively, judiciou&s;ly, and compo&s;edly, (without the lea&s;t &s;hew of human frailty) as if with bodily eyes he &s;aw the holy angels &s;tanding before him, ready to receive and carry his precious &s;oul into his Father's
<PB N="7" REF="7">glory. Verily he was mo&s;t lovely in his life, and yet more lovely at his death; the like I never be|held neither before nor &s;ince. And I doubt not but the &s;erious con&s;ideration of this narrative of his life and death will (through God's ble&s;&s;ing) beget a zea|lous imitation of this &s;aint indeed, in every good Chri&s;tian who reads the &s;ame: Which that it may do, is the hearty prayer of thy friend in the Lord Je&s;us,</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> An Account of him from his Childhood to the &s;eventeenth year of his Age.</HEAD>
<P>MR. John Janeway was born anno 1633. Octob. 27. of religious parents in Tylly in the county of Hertford. He &s;oon gave his parents the hope of much com|fort, and the &s;ymptoms of &s;omething more than ordinary quickly appeared in him, &s;o that &s;ome who &s;aw this child much feared that his life would be but &s;hort, others hoped that God had &s;ome rare piece of work to do by or for this child before he died; he &s;hewed that neither of them were much mi&s;taken in their conjecture concerning him. He &s;oon out-ran his &s;uperiors for age in learning. And it was thought by no incompetent judges that for pregnancy of wit, &s;olidity of judgment, the va&s;tne&s;s of his intellectuals, and the greatne&s;s of his memory, that he had no &s;uperiors, few equals con&s;idering his age and education.</P>
<P>He was initiated in the Latin tongue by his own father; afterward he was brought up for &s;ome time
<PB N="10" REF="10">at Paul's &s;chool in London, where he made a con&s;i|derable proficiency in Latin and Greek under the care of Mr. Langly. When he was about eleven years old he took a great fancy to arithmetic and the Hebrew tongue.</P>
<P>About this time his parents removing into a little village called A&s;poden, had the opportunity of hav|ing this their &s;on in&s;tructed, by a learned neighbour, who was plea&s;ed to count it a plea&s;ant diver&s;ion, to read mathematics to him being then about twelve years old; and he made &s;uch progre&s;s in tho&s;e pro|found &s;tudies; that he read Oughtred with un|der&s;tanding, before he was thirteen years old. A per&s;on of quality, hearing of the admirable profi|ciency of this boy, &s;ent for him up to London, and kept him with him for &s;ome time, to read mathematics to him; that which made him the more to be admired was, that he did what he did with the greate&s;t facility, He had no &s;mall &s;kill in mu&s;ic and other concomitants of mathematics.</P>
<P>In the year 1646. he was cho&s;en by that learned gentleman Mr. Rous the provo&s;t of Eton colledge, one of the foundation of that &s;chool, being exami|ned by provo&s;t and po&s;iers in the Hebrew tongue, which was thought was beyond pre&s;ident. Where he gave no un&s;uitable returns to the high expectati|ons that were conceived of him.</P>
<P>After a little continuance at Eton he obtained leave of his ma&s;ter to go to Oxford to perfect him|&s;elf in the &s;tudy of mathematics, where being own|ed by that great &s;cholar Dr. Ward, one of the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the univer&s;ity, he attained to a &s;trange ex|actne&s;s in that &s;tudy, nothing being within the reach of a man but he would undertake and gra&s;p. That great doctor gave him great help and encourage|ment, and looked upon him as one of the wonders of his age, loved him dearly, and could for &s;ome time after his death &s;carce mention his name with|out tears. When he had &s;pent about a quarter of a
<PB N="11" REF="11">year with Dr. Ward at Oxford, he was commanded to return again to Eton, where he &s;oon gave proof of his great improvement of his time while he was ab&s;ent; by making an almanac, and calculating of the eclip&s;es for many years before-hand; &s;o that by this time he had many eyes upon him as the glory of the &s;chool. That which put an accent upon his real worth was, that he did not di&s;cover the lea&s;t affectation or &s;elf-conceit, neither did any di&s;cerna|ble pride attend the&s;e excellencies. So that every one took more notice of his parts than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At about &s;eventeen years old he was cho&s;en to King's colledge in Cambridge, at which time the electioners did even contend for the patronage of this &s;cholar. He was cho&s;en fir&s;t that year, and an elder brother of his in the &s;ixth place; but he was very willing to change places with his elder brother; letting him have the fir&s;t, and thankfully accepting of the &s;ixth place.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his great learning, and many other orna|ments of nature, his deportment was &s;o &s;weet and lovely, his demeanour &s;o courteous and obliging, even when he &s;eemed unconverted, that he mu&s;t be vile with a witne&s;s that did not love him. Yea, ma|ny of them who had little kindne&s;s for morality, much le&s;s for grace; could not but &s;peak well of him. His great wi&s;dom and learning did even com|mand re&s;pect, where they did not find it: he had an excellent power over his pa&s;&s;ions, and was in a great mea&s;ure free from the vices which u&s;ually attend &s;uch an age and place.</P>
<P>But all this while it is to be feared, that he under|&s;tood little of the worth of Chri&s;t, and his own &s;oul; he &s;tudied indeed the heavens, and knew the motion of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, but that was his high|e&s;t; he thought yet but little of God, who made all the&s;e things, he pried but little into the motions of his own heart; he did not as yet much bu&s;y him|&s;elf, in the &s;erious ob&s;ervation of the wandering &s;pi|rit;
<PB N="12" REF="12">the creature had not yet led him to the Creator; but was &s;till too ready to take up with mere &s;peculation But God, who from all eternity had cho&s;en him to be one of tho&s;e, who &s;hould &s;hine as the &s;un in the firmament for ever in glory; did when he was about eighteen years old, &s;hine in upon his &s;oul with power; and did convince him what a poor thing it was to know &s;o much of the heavens and never come there. And that the grea|te&s;t knowledge in the world without Chri&s;t, was but an empty dry bu&s;ine&s;s. He now thought Mr. Bolton had &s;ome rea&s;on on his &s;ide, when he &s;aid; <Q>Give me the mo&s;t magnificent glorious worldling, that ever trod upon earthly mould, richly crowned with all the ornaments and excellencies of nature, art, policy, preferment; or what heart can wi&s;h be&s;ides; yet without the life of grace, to animate and enoble them; he were to the eye of heavenly wi&s;dom, but as a rotten carca&s;e, &s;tuck over with flowers; magnified dung, gilded rotten|ne&s;s, golden damnation.</Q> He began now to be of Anaxagoras's mind, that his work upon earth, was to &s;tudy heaven, and to get thither, and that except a man might be admitted to greater prefer|ment than this world can be&s;tow upon her favou|rites, it were &s;carce worth the while to be born.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of his Conver&s;ion, with vi&s;ible Proofs of it.</HEAD>
<P>THE great work of conver&s;ion, it was not carried on upon his &s;oul, in that dreadful manner, that it is upon &s;ome, that God intends to communicate much to, and make great u&s;e of; but the Lord was plea&s;ed, &s;weetly to unlock his heart, by the exemplary life, and heavenly and powerful di&s;cour&s;e, of a young man in the colledge, who&s;e heart God had inflamed with love to his &s;oul, he
<PB N="13" REF="13">quickly made an attempt upon this hopeful young man, and the Spirit of God did &s;et home his coun|&s;els with &s;uch power, that they proved effectual, for his awakening; being accompanied with the preach|ing of the&s;e two famous worthies, Dr. Hill and Dr. Arrow&s;mith, together with the reading &s;everal parts of Mr. Baxter's &s;aint's everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now a mighty alteration might ea&s;ily be di&s;cern|ed in him, he quickly looks quite like another man. He is now &s;o much taken up with things above the moon and &s;tars, that he had little lei&s;ure to think of the&s;e things only as they pointed higher. He began now not to ta&s;te &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s in tho&s;e kind of &s;tudies, which he did &s;o greedily imploy him&s;elf in formerly: He now began to pity them who were curious in their inquiries after every thing but that which is mo&s;t needful to be known, Chri&s;t and them&s;elves, and that which &s;ometimes was his gain, he now counted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t, yea, doubtle&s;s, he e&s;teemed all things but as dung and dro&s;s in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t, and de&s;ired to know nothing but Chri&s;t and him crucified. Not that he looked upon human learning as u&s;ele&s;s: but when fixed below Chri&s;t and not improved for Chri&s;t; he looked upon wi&s;dom as folly, and learning as madne&s;s, and that which would make one more like the devil, more fit for his &s;ervice, and put a greater accent upon their mi&s;ery in another world.</P>
<P>Mr. Janeway now begins to ca&s;t about how he might be&s;t improve what he did already know, and to turn all his &s;tudies into the right channel; grace did not take him off from, but made him more di|ligent and &s;piritual in his &s;tudy. And now Chri&s;t was at the end and bottom of every thing; how did he plot and contrive how he might mo&s;t expre&s;s his love and thankfulne&s;s to him who had brought him out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light; to this end he &s;ent up and down packets of divine letters, in which he did di&s;cour&s;e &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially and experi|mentally
<PB N="14" REF="14">of the great things of God, that it would not at all have unbecome &s;ome grey head to have owned what he did write.</P>
<P>He was not a little like young Elihu, who&s;e words he u&s;ed to excu&s;e his freedom with per&s;ons of years, who&s;e &s;ouls he did dearly pity. He &s;aid, <HI>Days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould teach wi&s;|dom, but there is a &s;pirit in a man, and the in&s;pirati|on of the Almighty giveth them under&s;tanding; I am full of matter, the &s;pirit within me con&s;traineth me, behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to bur&s;t like new bottles, I will &s;peak that I may be refre&s;hed,</HI> &amp;c. O then how &s;weet was the &s;avour of his graces! He could not but &s;peak the things which he had &s;een and heard, and even invite all the world to ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord was.</P>
<P>He began fir&s;t with his relations, begging and wooing of them to think of their precious and im|mortal &s;ouls, and to lay in &s;peedy provi&s;ions for a death-bed and eternity. O with what compa&s;&s;ion did he plead the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t with their &s;ouls! What pathetical expre&s;&s;ions did he u&s;e, what vehe|ment expo&s;tulations, how frequent, how particular in his applications to them? O with what gravity and maje&s;ty would he &s;peak of the my&s;teries of the go&s;pel.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are two things, the want of which I have had experience of in your family, though not in every degree; yet in that inten&s;e|ne&s;s of degree wherein they ought to be; which are the real power of godline&s;s and religion; and then that which is the fruit of the former, that chearfulne&s;s, delight, &s;piritual joy, and &s;erenity of mind which is to be had in religion, and no where el&s;e; and that not in religion in its weake&s;t de|grees, but in a real vigour, power, and life, and in a more clo&s;e con&s;tant walking with God; from a tender &s;en&s;e of the worth of &s;ouls, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of your family; and knowing the duty which my relation to it doth lay upon me, and having confi|dence of their well acceptance of it; I have un|dertaken to open my thoughts unto them.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t families in England I fear there is nei|ther the form nor the power of godline&s;s, where there is no fear of God, no regard of him, no ac|ting under him, or in reference to him. The&s;e are in my opinion twice dead, nay, not &s;o much as ha|ving the dead carca&s;e of religion: objects of pity they are, and O how few are there that &s;pend one compa&s;&s;ionate thought upon them!</P>
<P>Others there are, who &s;ome way or other, it may be from tradition from good parents, it may be from knowing the fa&s;hion of tho&s;e in their rank; it may be from the frequent inculcating of good in&s;tructions from Chri&s;tian friends or godly mini|&s;ters; or &s;ome &s;truggling eruptions of con&s;cience; have gotten the outward hu&s;k or &s;hell of religion, without any kernel or &s;olidity at all: and this ge|neration
<PB N="16" REF="16">doth u&s;ually tru&s;t to this their religion; that it will bring them to a place like a &s;leeping place in heaven, or keep them out of hell; though they live without God in the world. The&s;e are poor creatures too; making ha&s;te to their own de&s;truc|tion, and know it not yea, thinking that they are in a fair way for heaven O that there were never a family to which we are related which gave too &s;ad cau&s;e of fear, that it were in &s;uch a ca&s;e, or near &s;uch a ca&s;e as this is. A third &s;ort of people there are (and but few of the&s;e neither) which have the reality of religion, but yet in much weakne&s;s, coldne&s;s, faintne&s;s, dimne&s;s, and intermi&s;&s;ion; like Nilus's brood above half mud &s;till; beginning to have &s;ome life in their head, a little in their heart, but the feet of their affections and actions have lit|tle or no motion. And where &s;hall we find a Chri&s;tian that is got any higher than this, yea that doth in good earne&s;t &s;trive to get any higher! Now there are higher attainments to be reached after; there is a having our conver&s;ation in hea|ven while we are upon earth, neither doth this con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome weak di&s;cour&s;e about God, heaven and the things of religion, it con&s;i&s;ts not in the mere praying twice a day, and in keeping the Sab|bath in an u&s;ual manner in its order, it con&s;i&s;ts not in a few thoughts of religious objects coming into the mind in a common way, and as ea&s;ily lo&s;t as got. But true religion rai&s;eth the &s;oul to long|ings, hungrings, and thir&s;tings, not without &s;ome enjoyments. Religion in power is to act for God with &s;trength, vigour, earne&s;tne&s;s, inten&s;ene&s;s, de|light, cheerfulne&s;s, &s;erenity, and calmne&s;s of mind. The fruits of the &s;pirit are joy in the Holy Gho&s;t and peace: fear, di&s;quiet, and terrors are u&s;ually the introduction to a better &s;tate, but they are not of the e&s;&s;entials of religion; yea the contrary frame of &s;pirit is to be &s;triven for. To &s;peak yet more plain|ly, and to tell you, honoured Sir, what fears and
<PB N="17" REF="17">jealou&s;ies are, with reverence to your&s;elf, and tender affection to all your family, I fear that you your&s;elf are &s;ubject to too many de&s;ponding me|lancholy thoughts. The cau&s;es whereof give me leave with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to gue&s;s at. The fir&s;t I think may be reflecting on your entring upon the mini|&s;try without that reverence, care, holy zeal for God, love to Chri&s;t, and compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ouls, which is required of every one that undertakes that holy office; it may be there was rather a re&s;pect to your own living in the world than of living to God in the world, be it thus, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it not as bad, or be it wor&s;e; the remedy is the &s;ame. The&s;e have a wounding power in them, which will be felt to be grievous, when felt as they are in them&s;elves, but continual &s;orrow and &s;ad thoughts do keep this wound open too long, and are not available to the having of it cured. Wounds indeed mu&s;t be fir&s;t opened that they may be clean&s;ed, they mu&s;t be opened that their filth may be di&s;covered in refe|rence to a purging and healing; but no longer than the balm of Gilead is to be applied, that they may be healed. And when Chri&s;t is made u&s;e of aright he leaveth joy and comfort, yet a con&s;tant humility of &s;pirit is no way incon&s;i&s;tent with this peace of God.</P>
<P>A &s;econd cau&s;e of your heavine&s;s may be a &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the people which God hath commit|ted to you, and indeed who can but mourn over people in &s;uch a condition, objects of pity they are, and the more becau&s;e they pity not them&s;elves. I have often wre&s;tled with God that he would di|rect you in what is your duty concerning them, which I per&s;uade my&s;elf is your earne&s;t reque&s;t. Now, if after your &s;erious examining of your&s;elf what your con&s;cience doth conclude to be your duty, you do it, and &s;ee you do it; you are then to re&s;t upon God for his effectual working. Let not any think to be more merciful than God, for
<PB N="18" REF="18">wherein he doth, he goes beyond his bounds: and this is no more cau&s;e of heavine&s;s to you than the oppo&s;ition that the apo&s;tles found at any time was, who notwith&s;tanding rejoiced in tribulation. Another cau&s;e of heavine&s;s may be what divi&s;ions are between your&s;elf and &s;ome of your relation. O that a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and wi&s;dom might re|move all cau&s;e of &s;orrow for that. But were the power of godline&s;s more in hearts and families, all the cau&s;es of &s;uch trouble would &s;oon be re|moved, there would be le&s;s that would de&s;erve reprehen&s;ion, and there would be a fittedne&s;s of &s;pirit to give and bear reproof; to give in meek|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s, and to bear in humility, pa|tience, and thankfulne&s;s. Some cares and thoughts you may have concerning your family when you are gone. But let faith and former experience teach you to drive away all &s;uch thoughts. The con&s;titution and &s;olitarine&s;s may al&s;o be &s;ome cau&s;e of melancholy; but there is a duty which if it were exerci&s;ed would di&s;pel all; which is heaven|ly meditation, and contemplation of the things which true Chri&s;tian religion tends to If we did but walk clo&s;ely with God one hour in a day in this duty, O what influence would it have into the whole life. This duty with the u&s;efulne&s;s, man|ner, and direction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I knew in &s;ome mea&s;ure before, but had it more pre&s;&s;ed upon me by Mr. <HI>Baxter's &s;aint's everla&s;ting re&s;t,</HI> that can &s;carce be overvalued, for which I have cau&s;e for ever to ble&s;s God. As for your dear wife I fear the cares and troubles of the world take off her mind too much from walking with God &s;o clo&s;ely as &s;he ought to do, and from that earne&s;t endeavour af|ter higher degrees of grace. I commend therefore to her and all this excellent duty of meditation; it is a bitter &s;weet duty, bitter to corrupt nature, but &s;weet to the regenerate part if performed. I intreat her and your&s;elf, yea, I charge it upon you with
<PB N="19" REF="19">humility and tenderne&s;s, that God have at lea&s;t half an hour allowed him in a day for this exerci&s;e: O this mo&s;t precious &s;oul-rai&s;ing, &s;oul-ravi&s;hing, &s;oul-perfecting duty! Take this from your dear friend as &s;poke with reverence and real love and faithfulne&s;s. My fear and jealou&s;y le&s;t I &s;hould &s;peak in vain, maketh me &s;ay again: For God by me doth charge this upon you.</P>
<P>One more direction let me give, that none in your family &s;atisfy them&s;elves in family prayer. But let every one twice a day, if it may be po&s;&s;ible, draw near to God in &s;ecret duty. Here &s;ecret wants may be laid open; here great mercies may be begged with great earne&s;tne&s;s; here what wandering and coldne&s;s was in family duty may be repented of and mended. This is the way to get &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, reality, &s;incerity, cheerfulne&s;s in religion: and thus the joy of the Lord may be your &s;trength. Let tho&s;e who know their duty do it; if any think it not a nece&s;&s;ary duty, let them fear le&s;t they lo&s;e the mo&s;t excellent help for a holy, u&s;e|ful, joyful life under the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Spirit; whil&s;t they neglect that which they think unne|ce&s;&s;ary. Take &s;ome of the&s;e directions from &s;in|cere affection, &s;ome from my own experience, and all from a real and compa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of your joy and comfort. The Lord teach you in this and in the re&s;t. I intreat you never to re&s;t labouring &s;till on, till, after the foreta&s;tes of his comfort in this life, you have attained to true &s;piritual joy and peace in the Lord. The God of peace give you his di|rection, and the foreta&s;tes of his comforts in this life, and perfection in eternal life, in the enjoy|ing of infinite holine&s;s, purity, and excellency through Chri&s;t. Thus praying, I re&s;t&mdash;</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> His Carriage when Fellow of the College, at Twenty Years of Age.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he was about twenty years old, he was made fellow of the college, which did not a little advance tho&s;e noble projects which he had in his head, for the promoting of the intere&s;t of the Lord Chri&s;t. Then how &s;weetly would he in&s;inuate into the young ones de&s;iring to carry as many of them as po&s;&s;ibly he could along with him to heaven;
<PB N="21" REF="21">many attempts he made upon &s;ome of the &s;ame hou&s;e that he might &s;ea&s;on them with grace, and animate, and encourage tho&s;e who were looking towards heaven. And as for his own relations, never was there a more compa&s;&s;ionate and tender hearted bro|ther. How many pathetical letters did he &s;end to them! and how did he follow them with prayers and tears that they might prove &s;ucce&s;sful! how frequently would he addre&s;s him&s;elf to them in pri|vate! and how ready to improve providences and vi&s;its that he might &s;et them home upon them? How excellently would he &s;et forth the beauty of Chri&s;t! He earne&s;tly would per&s;uade them to enquire into the &s;tate of their &s;ouls. How would he endeavour to bring them off from &s;andy foundations, and re&s;ting upon their own righteou&s;|ne&s;s! In a word, he was &s;carce content to go to heaven, without, and through mercy he was very &s;ucce&s;sful among his own relations, and the whole family &s;oon &s;avoured of his &s;pirit; how were the children put upon getting choice &s;cripture and their catechi&s;ms, and engaged in &s;ecret prayer and medi|tation. Father, mother, brethren, &s;i&s;ters, boarders were the better for his excellent example and holy exhortations. He was a good nur&s;e, if not a &s;piri|tual father to his natural father, as you may read afterwards; and &s;ome of his brethren have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for ever that ever they &s;aw his face, and heard his words, and ob&s;erved his conver&s;ation, which had &s;o much of loveline&s;s and beauty in in that it could not but commend religion to any that did take notice of it. He could &s;peak in St. Paul's words, <HI>Brethren, my hearts de&s;ire and prayer to God for you all is, that you may be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Read what his heart was in the&s;e following lines.</P>
<P><Q>Di&s;tance of place cannot at all le&s;&s;en that natu|ral bond whereby we are conjoined in blood, nei|ther ought to le&s;&s;en that of love. Nay, where
<PB N="22" REF="22">true love is it cannot; for love towards you I can only &s;ay this, that I feel it better than I can expre&s;s it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it is wont to be with all affections: but love felt and not expre&s;&s;ed is little worth. I therefore de&s;ire to make my love manife&s;t in the be&s;t way I can. Let us look upon one another not as brethren only, but as members of the &s;ame body, whereof Chri&s;t is the head. Happy day will that be wherein the Lord will di&s;cover that union; let us therefore breathe and hunger after this, &s;o that our clo&s;e&s;t knot may meet in Chri&s;t: if we are in Chri&s;t and Chri&s;t in us, then we &s;hall be one with one ano|ther. This I know, you cannot complain for want of in&s;truction, God hath not been to us a dry wilderne&s;s, or a barren hearth; you have had line upon line, and precept upon precept; he hath planted you by the rivers of water; it is the Lord alone indeed who maketh fruitful, but yet we are not to &s;tand &s;till and do nothing. There is a crown worth &s;eeking for; &s;eek therefore, and that earne&s;tly. O &s;eek by continual prayer, keep your &s;oul in a praying frame, this is a great and nece&s;&s;ary duty, nay, a high and precious privi|lege. If thou can&s;t &s;ay nothing, come and lay thy&s;elf in an humble manner before the Lord. You may believe me, for I have through mercy experienced what I &s;ay. There is more &s;weetne&s;s to be got in one glimp&s;e of God's love, than in all that the world can afford. O do but try: O ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is Get into a corner and throw your&s;elf down before the Lord, and beg of God to make you &s;en&s;ible of your lo&s;t un|done &s;tate by nature, and of the excellency and nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t. Say, Lord, give me a broken heart, &s;often, melt me. Any thing in the world, &s;o I may be but enabled to value Chri&s;t, and be per&s;uaded to accept of him, as he is tendered in the go&s;pel. O that I may be delivered from the wrath to come; O a ble&s;&s;ing for me, even for me,
<PB N="23" REF="23">and re&s;olve not to be content till the Lord have in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered you. O my bowels yern towards you: my heart works. O that you did but know with what affection I write now to you, and what prayers and tears have been mingled with the&s;e lines, the Lord &s;et the&s;e things home and give you a heart to apply them to your &s;elf, the Lord ble&s;s all the means that you enjoy, for his ble&s;&s;ing is all in all. Give me leave to deal plainly and to come yet a little clo&s;er to you for I love your &s;oul &s;o well, that I cannot bear the thoughts of the lo&s;s of it. Know this that there is &s;uch a thing as the new birth and except a man be born again he cannot enter in|to the kingdom of heaven; God's favour is not to be recovered without it. This new birth hath its foundation laid in a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and godly &s;orrow for it, and a heart &s;et again&s;t it; without this there can be no &s;alvation. Look well about you and &s;ee into your &s;elf, and thou wilt &s;ee that thou art at hells mouth without this fir&s;t &s;tep, and nothing but free grace and pure mercy is between you and the &s;tate of the Devils. The Lord deliver us from a &s;ecure carele&s;s heart! Here you &s;ee a natural man's condition. How dare&s;t thou then ly down in &s;e|curity. O look about for your &s;ouls &s;ake. What &s;hall I &s;ay, what &s;hall I do to awaken your poor &s;oul! I &s;ay again, without repentance there is no remi&s;&s;ion; and repentance it&s;elf may loo&s;e its la|bour if it be not in the right manner. Then tears, and groans, and prayers will not do without Chri&s;t; mo&s;t when they are convinced of &s;in, and are un|der fears of hell run to duty and reform &s;omething. and thus the wound is healed, and by this thou&s;|ands fall &s;hort of heaven. For if we be not brought off from our&s;elves and our righteou&s;ne&s;s as well as our &s;ins we are never like to be &s;aved. We mu&s;t &s;ee an ab&s;olute need of a Chri&s;t, and give our&s;elves up to him, and count all but dung and dro&s;s in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s. Look there|fore
<PB N="24" REF="24">for mercy only in Chri&s;t, for his &s;ake rely up|on God's mercy. The terms of the go&s;pel are re|pent and believe, gracious terms!

Do&s;t thou de&s;ire mercy and grace, I know thou do&s;t; even this is the gift of God to de|&s;ire, hunger after Chri&s;t; let de&s;ires put you upon endeavour, the work it&s;elf is &s;weet; yea repent|ance and mourning it&s;elf hath more &s;weetne&s;s in it than all the worlds comforts. Upon repentance and believing, comes ju&s;tification, after this &s;ancti|fication, by the &s;pirit dwelling in us. By this we come to be the children of God, to be made par|takers of the divine nature, to lead new lives, to have a &s;uitablene&s;s to God.

Be &s;ure to keep a con&s;cience void of offence, and yield by no means to any known &s;in; be much in prayer, in &s;ecret prayer, and in reading the &s;crip|tures.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> His Particular Addre&s;&s;es to his Brethren, for their Souls Gooddand the Succe&s;s thereof.</HEAD>
<P>HE wrote many letters of this nature, and de|&s;ired oftentimes to be vi&s;iting his brethren that he might particularly addre&s;s him&s;elf to them and &s;ee what became of his letters, prayers,
<PB N="25" REF="25">and tears, and he was very watchful over them, ready to reprove and convince them of &s;in, and ready to encourage any beginnings of a good work in them. To in&s;tance in a particular or two.</P>
<P>One time perceiving one of his brethren a&s;leep at prayer in the family; he pre&s;ently took occa&s;ion to &s;how him what a high contempt it was of God what a little &s;en&s;e &s;uch a man mu&s;t have of his own dan|ger, what dreadful hypocri&s;y, what a miracle of patience that he was not awakened in flames. After he had been a while affectionately pleading with him, it plea&s;ed the Lord to &s;trike in with &s;ome power and to melt and &s;often his brother's heart when he was about eleven years old, &s;o that it was to be ho|ped that then the Lord began &s;avingly to work upon the heart of that child. For from that time forward a con&s;iderable alteration might be di&s;cerned in him. When he perceived it he was not a little plea&s;ed. This put him upon carrying on the work, that con|viction might not wear off till it ended in conver&s;i|on. To this end he wrote to him, <HI>to put him in mind of what God had done for his &s;oul, begging of him not to re&s;t &s;atisfied till he knew what a thorow change and effectual calling meant. I hope, &s;aid he, that God hath a good work to do in you, for you, and by you; yea, I hope he hath already begun it. But O take not up with &s;ome beginnings, faint de&s;ires, lazy &s;eekings; O remember your former tears, one may weep a little for &s;in and yet go to hell for &s;in; many that are under &s;ome &s;uch work, &s;hake of the &s;en&s;e of &s;in, murder their convictions, and return again to folly. O! take heed! of any draw back the Lord will take no plea&s;ure in them; but I hope better things of you.</HI></P>
<P>He would al&s;o ob&s;erve how his brethren carried at after duty, whether they &s;eemed to run pre&s;ently to the world with greedine&s;s, as if duty were a ta&s;k, or whether there &s;eemed to be an abiding impre&s;&s;ion of God and the things of God upon them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> His great Love to, and Prequency in the Duty of Prayer: With remarkable Succe&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>HE was mighty in prayer, and his &s;pirit was of|tentimes &s;o tran&s;ported in it that he forgot the weakne&s;s of his own body and of others &s;pirits; indeed the acquaintance that he had with God was &s;o &s;weet, and his conver&s;e with him &s;o frequent, that when he was engaged in duty he &s;carce knew how to leave that which was &s;o delightful and &s;uited to his &s;pirit. His con&s;tant cour&s;e for &s;ome years was this. He prayed at lea&s;t three times a day in &s;ecret, &s;ometimes &s;even times, twice a day in the family or college. And he found the &s;weetne&s;s of it beyord imagination, and enjoyed wonderful communion with God, and ta&s;ted much of the plea&s;antne&s;s of a heavenly life. And he could &s;ay by experience, that
<PB N="27" REF="27">the ways of wi&s;dom were ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths peace. He knew what it was to wre&s;tle with God, and was come to that pa&s;s that he could &s;carce come off his knees without his Father's ble&s;|&s;ing. He was u&s;ed to conver&s;e with God with a ho|ly familiarity as a friend, and would upon all occa|&s;ions run to him for advice, and had many &s;trange and immediate an&s;wers of prayer. One of which I think it not altogether impertinent to give the world an account of,</P>
<P>His honoured father, Mr. William Janeway, mi|ni&s;ter of Kel&s;hall in Hartfort&s;hire, being &s;ick, and being under &s;omewhat dark apprehen&s;ions as to the &s;tate of his &s;oul, he would often &s;ay to his &s;on John: O &s;on! this pa&s;&s;ing upon eternity is a great thing, this dying is a &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s, and enough to make any one's heart ake, that hath not his pardon &s;eal|ed, and his evidences for heaven clear. And truly &s;on, I am in no &s;mall fears as to my own &s;tate for another world. O that God would clear his love! O that I could &s;ay chearfully, I can die, and upon good grounds be able to look death in the face, and venture upon eternity with well grounded peace and comfort!</P>
<P>His &s;weet and dutiful &s;on made a &s;uitable reply at pre&s;ent; but &s;eeing his dear father continuing under de&s;pondings of &s;pirit (though no Chri&s;tians that knew him, but had a high e&s;teem of him for his uprightne&s;s) he got by him&s;elf and &s;pent &s;ome time in wre&s;tling with God upon his father's account, earne&s;tly begging of God that he would fill him with joy un&s;peakable in believing, and that he would &s;peedily give him &s;ome token for good, that he might joyfully and honourably leave this world to go to a better. After he was ri&s;en from his knees he came down to his &s;ick father, and asked him how he felt him&s;elf. His father made no an&s;wer for &s;ome time, but wept exceedingly (a pa&s;&s;ion that he was not &s;ubject to) and continued for &s;ome con&s;i|derable
<PB N="28" REF="28">time in an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion of weep|ing, &s;o that he was not able to &s;peak. But at la&s;t having recovered him&s;elf with un&s;peakable joy he bur&s;t out into &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e. O &s;on! now it is come, it is come, it is come. I ble&s;s God I can die. The &s;pirit of God hath witne&s;&s;ed with my &s;pirit that I am his child: now I can look up to God as my dear Father, and Chri&s;t as my Redeem|er, I can now &s;ay this is my friend, and this is my beloved. My heart is full, it is brim full: I can hold no more. I know now what that &s;entence means, the peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth under&s;tand|ing, I know now what that white &s;tone is wherein a new name is written, which none know but they who have it. And that fit of weeping which you &s;aw me in, was a fit of overpowering love and joy, &s;o great that I could not for my heart contain my|&s;elf: neither can I expre&s;s what glorious di&s;coveries God hath made of him&s;elf unto me. And had that joy been greater, I que&s;tion whether I could have born it, and whether it would not have &s;eparated &s;oul and body. Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and all that is within me, ble&s;s his holy name that hath par|doned all my &s;ins, and &s;ealed the pardon. He hath healed my wounds, and cau&s;ed the bones which he had broken to rejoice. O help me to ble&s;s the Lord! he hath put a new &s;ong into my mouth: O ble&s;s the Lord for his infinite goodne&s;s and rich mercy! O now I can die! It is nothing, I ble&s;s God I can die. I de&s;ire to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t. You may well think that his &s;ons heart was not a little refre&s;hed to hear &s;uch words, and &s;ee &s;uch a &s;ight, and to meet the me&s;&s;enger he had &s;ent to heaven returned back again &s;o &s;peedily. He count|ed him&s;elf a &s;harer with his father in this mercy, and it was upon a double account welcome, as it did &s;o wonderfully &s;atisfie his father and as it was &s;o im|mediate and clear an an&s;wer of his own prayers, as if God had from heaven &s;aid unto him thy tears and
<PB N="29" REF="29">prayers, are heard for thy father: thou ha&s;t like a prince prevailed with God: thou ha&s;t got the ble&s;&s;|ing: thy fervent prayers have been effectual: go down and &s;ee el&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this, this precious young man broke forth into prai&s;es and even into another exta&s;ie of joy that God &s;hould deal &s;o familiarly with him; and the father and &s;on together were &s;o full of joy, light, life, love and prai&s;e that there was a little heaven in the place. He could not then but expre&s;s him&s;elf in this manner. O ble&s;&s;ed and for ever ble&s;&s;ed be God for his infinite grace! O who would not pray unto God! verily he is a God that heareth prayers and that my &s;oul knows right well! And then he told his joyful father, how much he was affected with former di&s;|pondings and what he had been praying for ju&s;t be|fore with all the earne&s;tne&s;s he could for his &s;oul, and how the Lord had immediately an&s;wered him. His Father hearing this, and perceiving that his for|mer comforts came in a way of prayer, and his own childs prayer too, was the more refre&s;hed and was the more confirmed, that it was from the Spirit of God, and no delu&s;ion. And immediately his Son &s;tanding by he fell into another fit of triumphing joy, his weak body being almo&s;t ready to &s;ink under that great weight of glory that did &s;hine in &s;o powerfully upon his &s;oul. He could then &s;ay, <HI>Now let thy &s;ervant depart in peace, for my eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation.</HI> He could now walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death and fear no evil. O how &s;weet a thing it is to have ones intere&s;t in Chri&s;t cleared, how comfortable to have our calling and election made &s;ure? How lovely is the &s;ight of a &s;miling Je&s;us when one is dying! How refre&s;hing is it when heart and fle&s;h and all is failing, to have God for the &s;trength of our heart and our portion for ever! O did the fooli&s;h and unexperienced world but know what the&s;e things mean, did they but un|der&s;tand what it is to be &s;olaced with the believing views of glory, to have their &s;en&s;es &s;piritually exer|ci&s;ed,
<PB N="30" REF="30">could they but ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is, it would &s;oon cau&s;e them di&s;reli&s;h their low and bruti&s;h plea&s;ures, and look upon all worldly joys as infinitely &s;hort of one glimp&s;e of God's love? After this his reverend father had a &s;weet calm up|on his &s;pirits, and went in the &s;trength of that pro|vi&s;ion that rich grace laid in, till he came within the gates of the new Jeru&s;alem: having all his graces greatly improved, &s;hewed &s;o much humility, love to and admiring of God, contempt of the world, &s;uch &s;urprizing of Chri&s;t, &s;uch patience as few Chri&s;tians arrive to, e&s;pecially his faith by which with extraor|dinary confidence he ca&s;t his widow and eleven fa|therle&s;s children upon the care of that God who had fed him with this manna in his wilderne&s;s &s;tate. The benefit of which faith all his children (none of which were in his life time provided for) have &s;ince to ad|miration experienced. And it is &s;carce to be ima|gined how helpful thus his precious Son John Jane|way was to his Father by his heavenly di&s;cour&s;e, humble advice and prayers.

<P><Q>Daily ob&s;ervation, and every man's experience gives &s;ufficient te&s;timony to it, that afflictions of what kind &s;oever, by how much the &s;eldomer they
<PB N="31" REF="31">are, the more grievous they &s;eem. We have for a long time &s;ailed in the rivers of ble&s;&s;ings which God hath plentifully poured forth among us; now if we come where the waves of affliction do but a little more than ordinarily ari&s;e, we begin to have our &s;ouls almo&s;t carried down with fears and griefs; yea the natural man if not counter powered by the &s;pirit of God, will be ready to entertain murmer|ing and repining thoughts again&s;t God him&s;elf. Whereas, if all our life had been a pilgrimage full of &s;orrows and afflictions (as we de&s;erved) and had but rarely been intermingled with comforts. we &s;hould have been more fitted to bear afflictions. Thus it is naturally: but we ought to counter work again&s;t the &s;tream of nature by a new principle wrought in us, and what&s;oever nature doth err in, grace is to rectifie. And they upon whom grace is be&s;towed ought to &s;et grace on work. For where|fore is grace be&s;towed unle&s;s it &s;hould act in us: It hath plea&s;ed the Lord to make a breach in your family, There where the knot is fa&s;te&s;t tied; when it is di&s;united the change becomes greater and the grief is the more inlarged. So that herein you who are mo&s;t moved are mo&s;t to be excu&s;ed and comforted, the &s;trength of a mothers affection I believe none but mothers know, and greate&s;t af|fections when they are di&s;turbed breed the greate&s;t grief But when afflictions come upon us what will be our duty? Shall we then give our|&s;elves up to be carried way with the griev|ing pa&s;&s;ions? Shall we, becau&s;e of one afflic|tion cau&s;e our &s;ouls to walk <HI>in &s;adne&s;s all our days, and drive away all the light of comfort from our eyes</HI> by cau&s;ing our &s;ouls to be ob&s;cured under the &s;hades of melancholy? Shall we quarrel with our maker and call the wi&s;e righteous Judge to our bar? Doth he not puni&s;h us le&s;s than we de&s;erve? Is there not mercy and truth in all his di&s;pen&s;ations? Shall we by continual &s;orrow add affliction to affliction and &s;o be|come our own tormentors? Are we not under afflic|tions
<PB N="32" REF="32">to &s;ee if any way we may find a glimp&s;e of God's love &s;hining in towards us and &s;o to rai&s;e up our &s;ouls nearer God. Is there not enough in God and the holy &s;criptures to bear up our &s;pirits under any afflictions let them be never &s;o great. What do you &s;ay to that word; who is there among you that feareth the Lord, and that obeyeth the voice of his &s;ervant that walketh in darkne&s;s and &s;eeth no light, let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord and &s;tay him&s;elf upon his God though all earthly com|forts were fled away, and though you could &s;ee no light from any of the&s;e things below: yet if you look upward to God in Chri&s;t there is comfort to be found, there is light to be e&s;pied; yea a great and glorious light, which if we can rightly di&s;cern, it would put out the light of all lower comforts and cau&s;e them to be vilely accounted of. But alas! alas! tho&s;e heavenly comforts though they are in them&s;elves &s;o precious, and if really and &s;en&s;ibly felt able to rai&s;e a man's &s;oul from earth, yea from hell to the foreta&s;te of heaven it&s;elf, yet for want of a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e they are by mo&s;t of the world undervalued, &s;lighted, and thought to be but fan|cies. Nay let me &s;peak freely: Chri&s;tians them|&s;elves and tho&s;e whom we have cau&s;e to hope are men of another world and truly born again, yet for want of a &s;piritual quickne&s;s in this &s;piritual &s;ight and &s;en&s;e their comforts are too lowly and meanly e&s;teemed of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e that enableth a Chri&s;tian to behold a glorious lu&s;tre and beauty in invi&s;ibles, and rai&s;eth the &s;oul up to the gate of heaven it&s;elf, and when he is there how can he choo&s;e but look down with a holy &s;lighting and contempt upon the &s;weete&s;t of all earthly enjoyments? How can he choo&s;e but think all creature comforts but &s;mall, compared with one look of love from Chri&s;t? This heavenly comfort was that which David did &s;o much de&s;ire. <HI>Lord, lift up the light of thy counte|nance
<PB N="33" REF="33">upon me,</HI> was the language of his &s;oul, and when this was come how was his heart enlarged? Thou ha&s;t put joy and gladne&s;s in my heart more than in the time when their corn and wine increa|&s;ed. He then that in afflictions would find com|fort, mu&s;t &s;trive to &s;ee &s;piritual comforts to the greate&s;t, even that comfort which is from God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this, this will be a cordial, this will be as marrow and fatne&s;s to the &s;oul. They who have intere&s;t in Chri&s;t what need they be moved and di&s;comfited with worldly trou|ble? Is not Chri&s;t better than ten children, is not his loving-kindne&s;s better than life? Is not all the world a &s;hadow, compared with one quarter of an hours enjoyment of him, even on this &s;ide of glory in &s;ome of his own ordiances. O therefore &s;trive to get your intere&s;t in this comfort &s;ecured and then all's well. He that hath Chri&s;t hath all things. If God be reconciled to you through him, then he will withhold no good thing from you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We poor fooli&s;h creatures do &s;carce know what is good for our&s;elves, but it is no &s;mall encou|ragement to the people of God that wi&s;dom it&s;elf takes care of them, and one that loves them better than they love them&s;elves looks after them: and he hath given them his promi&s;e for it, that all &s;hall work together for their good. And what better foundation of comfort can there be in the whole world than this! Why may you not then &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul, and why art thou di&s;quieted in me, hope in God. Let not your &s;oul &s;ink under afflic|tions, for what rea&s;on have you to be di&s;comfited under them. Can you gather from thence that the Lord doth not love you? No &s;urely, but rather the contrary, for whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;t|neth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiv|eth, What &s;on is he that the father cha&s;tneth
<PB N="34" REF="34">not? Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</Q></P>
<P>Let this &s;erve as a remedy again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive grief. Get your love to God increa&s;ed, which if you do, the love of all other things will wax cold. And if you have given God your heart, you will give him leave to take what he will that is yours, and what he hath you will judge rather well kept than lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Remember that &s;cripture, and let it have its due impre&s;&s;ion upon your &s;pirit; <HI>He that loves father or mother, brother or &s;i&s;ter, yea or children more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> O labour to have your affecti|ons therefore more rai&s;ed up to him who is mo&s;t worthy of them, let him have the uppermo&s;t and greate&s;t room in your heart, and let your love to all other things be placed in &s;ubjection to your love of God, be ruled by it, and directed to it. Be our earthly afflictions never &s;o great, yet let this love to God poi&s;e your &s;ouls, &s;o that they may not be over|weighed with grief on the one &s;ide, or &s;tupidne&s;s on the other &s;ide. Again, let our &s;ouls be awed by that glorious power and omnipotency of God, who is able to do any thing, and who will do what|&s;oever plea&s;eth him both in heaven and in earth; at who&s;e word and for who&s;e glory all things that are were made. And what are we poor creatures, that we &s;hould dare to entertain any hard thought of this God! It is dangerous contending with God! Let us learn that great le&s;&s;on of re&s;igning up our&s;elves and all we have to God; let us put our&s;elves as in|&s;truments into the hands of the Lord, to do what he plea&s;eth with us, and let us remember that it was our promi&s;e and covenant with God to yield our|&s;elves up to him, and to be wholly at his di&s;po&s;al. The &s;oul is then in a &s;weet frame when it can cor|dially &s;ay, <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth good in his eyes. Not my will, but thine be done.</HI> Again, let us know that though we cannot always &s;ee into the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the ways of God, (for
<PB N="35" REF="35">his ways are often in the thick cloud, and our weak eyes cannot look into tho&s;e depths in which he walketh) yet all the ways of God are ju&s;t, holy, and good. Let us therefore have a care of &s;o much as moving, much more of entertaining any unwor|thy thoughts again&s;t God. But let us &s;ubmit wil|lingly to the yoke which he is plea&s;ed to lay upon us, le&s;t he break us with terrible judgments. And now it hath &s;eemed good to God to lay this &s;troke upon you, I pray labour rightly to improve it, and let this trial prepare you for greater. And &s;eeing the uncertainty of all worldly things, endeavour with all your might to get your heart above them, and I be&s;eech the Lord who is the great Phy&s;ician of &s;ouls and knows how to apply a &s;alve to every &s;ore of his, to comfort you with his &s;piritual comforts, that he would favourably &s;hine upon you and re|ceive you into a nearer union and communion with him&s;elf. Into his hands I commit you, with him I leave you, praying that he would make up all in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was an excellent example to his younger bre|thren; and his wi&s;e in&s;tructions, and holy practi|ces, did not a little influence them. He was a pru|dent coun&s;ellor, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant that could not well be &s;pared to his elde&s;t brother: who was not a little &s;en&s;ible of that per&s;onal worth that was in his young|er brother; whom he would prefer before him&s;elf, as one whom he judged, God had honoured with far greater parts, graces, and experiences than him|&s;elf.

<P>When he was but young, yet he began to be ta|ken notice of by antient mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tians; though his mode&s;ty was &s;o great, that his huge parts, were not a little ob&s;cured thereby; and his va&s;t worth was &s;o balla&s;ted with humility, that he made

<P>Whil&s;t he was in this declining condition, in which he could have little hopes of life; he was &s;o far from being affrighted, that he received the &s;entence of death in him&s;elf with great joy; and wrote to his dear|e&s;t relations, to di&s;po&s;e them to a patient compliance with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, as might &s;eparate him and them for a while: And to wean their affections from him, he &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed, that as for him&s;elf he was a&s;hamed to de&s;ire and pray for life. <HI>Oh</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>Is there any thing here more de&s;irable than the enjoy|ment of Chri&s;t? Can I expect any thing below, com|parable to that ble&s;&s;ed vi&s;ion? O, that crown, that re&s;t which remains for the people of God! And (ble&s;&s;ed be God) that I can &s;ay, I know it is mine, know that, when this tabernacle of clay &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, I have a hou&s;e not made with hands; and therefore I groan, not to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon with Chri&s;t. To me to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I can now, through infinite mercy, &s;peak in the a|po&s;tle's language, I have fought a good fight, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown incorruptible, that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>When he perceived one of his neare&s;t relations
<PB N="39" REF="39">di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at the apprehen&s;ion of his death, he charg|ed him not to pray for his life, except it were pure|ly with a re&s;pect to the glory of God <HI>I wi&s;h</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I beg you, to keep your minds in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive frame to the will of God concerning me. The Lord take you near|er to him&s;elf, that you may walk with him; to whom if I go before, I hope you will follow after.</HI> Yet, after this, he was through mercy finely recovered, and his friends were not without &s;ome hopes of his living to be eminently in&s;trumental for God's glory in his ge|neration</P>
<P>After he was recovered in &s;ome mea&s;ure he fell again to his former practice of engaging deeply in the &s;ecret and great duties of religion, which he con&s;tantly practi&s;ed (except when God di&s;charged him by &s;ickne&s;s;) &s;ecret prayer, at lea&s;t three times a day &s;ometimes &s;even times yea more; be&s;ides fa|mily, and colledge duties, which were before hinted he &s;et apart an hour every day for &s;et and &s;olemn meditation; which duty he found un&s;peakable to improve his graces, and to make no &s;mall addition to his comforts: His time for that duty was mo&s;t commonly in the evening, when he u&s;ually walked in|to the field, if the weather would permit; if not, he retired into the church, or any empty &s;olitary room. Where, (ob&s;erving his con&s;tant practice, that, if po&s;|&s;ible, I might be aquainted with the rea&s;on of his retiredne&s;s) I once hid my&s;elf that I might take the more exact notice of the intercour&s;e, that, I judged, was kept up between him and God&punc; But, O what a &s;pectacle did I &s;ee! Surely a man walking with God, conver&s;ing intimately with his maker, and maintain|ing a holy familiarity with the great Jehovah. Me thought I &s;aw one talking with God; me-thought, I &s;aw a &s;piritual merchant in an heavenly exchange, driving a rich trade for the trea&s;ures of the other world. O what a glorious &s;ight it was! Me-thinks, I &s;ee him &s;till; how &s;weetly, did his face &s;hine! O with what a lovely countenance did he walk up and
<PB N="40" REF="40">down, his lips going; his body oft reaching up, as if he could have taken his flight into heaven! His looks, &s;miles, and every motion &s;pake him to be u|pon the very confines of glory. O, had one but known what he was then feeding on! Sure, he had <HI>meat to eat which the world knew not of!</HI> Did we but know how welcome God made him when he brought him into his banqueting-hou&s;e. That which one might ea&s;ily perceive his heart to be mo&s;t fixed up|on, was, the infinite love of God in Chri&s;t, to the poor lo&s;t &s;ons and daughters of Adam. What el&s;e meant his high expre&s;&s;ions? What el&s;e did his own words to a dear friend &s;ignifie, but an extraordinary &s;en&s;e of the freene&s;s, fulne&s;s, and duration of that love. To u&s;e his own words, <HI>God</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>holds mine eyes mo&s;t upon his goodne&s;s, his unmea&s;urable good|ne&s;s, and the promi&s;es which are mo&s;t &s;ure, and firm in Chri&s;t. His love to us is greater, &s;urer, fuller than ours to our&s;elves&punc; For when we loved our&s;elves &s;o as to de&s;troy our&s;elves, he loved us &s;o as to &s;ave us.</HI></P>

<P>AND that he might engage others in more ar|dent affections to God he put words into their mouths; <HI>Let us then</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>behold him, till our hearts de&s;ire, till our very &s;ouls are drawn out after him, till we are brought to aquaintance, intimacy, delight in him!</HI> O that he would love me, O that I might love him!

It is good for me, to draw near to God. <Q>A day in his court is better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere; My &s;oul longeth, yea faint|eth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fle&s;h crieth out for the living God.</Q> Oh that I were received into conver&s;e with him, that I might hear
<PB N="41" REF="41">his voice and &s;ee his countenance! For, His voice is &s;weet and his countenance is comely! Oh that I might communicate my&s;elf to God, and he would give him&s;elf to me! O that I might love him! That I were &s;ick of love, that I might die in love! That I might lo&s;e my&s;elf in his love, as a &s;mall drop in the unfathomable depth of his love! That I might dwell in his eternal love! O (&s;aith he to a dear friend under &s;ome fears as to his &s;tate) &s;tand &s;till and wonder, behold his love and admire; now, if never yet, con&s;ider what thou can&s;t di&s;cover in this precious Je&s;us. Can&s;t thou not &s;ee &s;o much till thou can&s;t &s;ee no more, not becau&s;e of its &s;hortne&s;s, but becau&s;e of thy darkne&s;s?</P>
<P>Here's a &s;ea: fling thy&s;elf into it, and thou &s;halt he compa&s;&s;ed with the height, and depth, and breadth, and length of love, and be filled with all the fulne&s;s of God. Is not this enough! What would&s;t thou have more? Fling away all be&s;ides God, God is portion enough, and the only proper portion of thy &s;oul. Ha&s;t thou not ta&s;ted, ha&s;t thou not known, that his love is better than wine? Ha&s;t thou not &s;melt the &s;avour of his precious ointments, for which the virgins love him? This, this is he who is alto|gether lovely. And, while I write, my heart doth burn, my &s;oul is on fire, I am &s;ick of love</P>
<P>Dear &s;oul, come near and look upon his face, and &s;ee whether thou can&s;t choo&s;e but love him. Fall upon him, embrace him, give him thy deare&s;t choi&s;e&s;t love: all's too little for him; let faith and love ki&s;s him: you &s;hall be no more bold than wel|come. Fix thine eyes again and again upon him look upon his lovely, &s;weet and royal face; till thou art taken with this beautiful Per&s;on, who hath not his fellow upon the earth, his equal among the angels. Come near, &s;till contemplate his excellen|cy, review each part, and thou wilt find him to be made up of love; wind thy affections about him; bind thy &s;oul to him, with the cords of love. Thus
<PB N="42" REF="42">&s;halt thou find a new life to animate thy &s;oul, thou &s;halt then feel a new warmth to melt thy heart; a divine fire to burn up corruption, and to break forth into a flame of heavenly love; dwell in this love, and thou &s;halt dwell in God, and God in thee. But now, methinks, I &s;ee you almo&s;t all in tears, becau&s;e thou feele&s;t not &s;uch workings of love towards God. Weep on &s;till; for, love hath tears as well as grief: and tears of love &s;hall be kept in his bot|tle as well as they; yea, they &s;hall be as precious jewels, and as an excellent ornament. Ha&s;t thou felt &s;uch meltings of loving-grief? Know, that they are no other than the &s;treams of Chri&s;t's love flow|ing to you, and through you, and from you to him again. And thus is Chri&s;t delighted in beholding of his own beauties, in his &s;pou&s;e's eye.</P>
<P>I have prayed for a ble&s;&s;ing for you, and on the&s;e related to you, and if they prove of any power by the Spirit of God to you, it will be matter of joy and prai&s;e. By your dear friend, John Janeway.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> His Temptations from Satan.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, you have a ta&s;te of his &s;pirit and may perceive, what it was that he had his heart mo&s;t &s;et upon; and what kept his graces in &s;uch vi|gour and activity; and how de&s;irous he was that others &s;hould be &s;harers with him in this mercy: Yet, for all this, he had his gloomy days, and the &s;un was &s;ometimes overca&s;t, his &s;weets were &s;ome|times imbittered with dreadful, and horrid tempta|tions. The Devil &s;hot his poi&s;onous arrows at him; yet, through the Captain of his &s;alvation, he became, more than a conqueror, out of the field. He was, with Paul, many times <HI>lifted up into the third heavens and &s;aw and heard things unutterable:</HI> but, <HI>le&s;t he &s;hould be exalted above mea&s;ure, there was a me&s;&s;enger of Satan &s;ent to buffet him</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">It would make a Chri&s;tian's heart even ake to hear and read what &s;trange temptations this graci|ous &s;oul was exerci&s;ed with. But he was well for &s;uch a conflict, having on the &s;hield of faith whereby he quenched the fiery darts of the wicked one: yet, this fight co&s;t him the &s;weating of his very body for agonies of &s;pirit; and tears and &s;trong cries to hea|ven, for fre&s;h help. As for him&s;elf, he was wont to take an arrow out of God's quiver and di&s;charge it by faith and prayer, for the di&s;comfiture of his violent enemy, who at la&s;t was fain to fly.</P>
<P>The&s;e temptations and conflicts with Satan did not a little help him afterwards in his dealing with one that was &s;orely afflicted with temptations of the like nature And becau&s;e I judge it of &s;ingular u&s;e to tempted ones, and find very many of late to be exerci&s;ed in this kind, I &s;hall in&s;ert a letter of his, &s;uitable to all Chri&s;tians in the like ca&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter of Mr. John Janeway's.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letters are bitter in the mouth, but &s;weet in the belly; they contain matter of joy, under a di&s;mal a&s;pect: they are good news, brought by a me&s;&s;enger in mourning: I had rather hear of that which is matter of &s;ub&s;tantial real joy, though mixed with many &s;ighs, and interrupted with many groans and &s;obs; than of laughter, in the mid&s;t of which the heart is &s;ad.</P>
<P>You &s;ay that you are troubled with bla&s;phemous thoughts: &s;o then, though they are bla&s;phemous, yet they are your trouble; and thoughts they are too, and that neither &s;ent for nor welcome; and &s;o are not a&s;&s;ented to in your mind. What then &s;hall we think of them? If they were of your own production, your heart would be delighted in its own i&s;&s;ue: but you do nothing le&s;s. Sure then,
<PB N="44" REF="44">they are the injections of that wicked one, who is the accu&s;er of the brethren, and the di&s;turber of the peace of the people of God. But, doth Satan u&s;e to employ tho&s;e weapons, but again&s;t tho&s;e that he is in &s;ome fear of lo&s;ing? He is not wont to a&s;&s;ault and fight again&s;t his &s;ure&s;t friends in this manner. Tho&s;e that he hath fa&s;t in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he leads on, as &s;oftly and quietly as he can; fearing le&s;t &s;uch di&s;turbance &s;hould make them look about them, and &s;o they &s;hould awake and &s;ee their danger. But as for tho&s;e, that have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, e&s;caped his &s;nares; he follows them hard, with all the di&s;couragements he can. Surely the&s;e things can be no other but a bitter reli&s;h of tho&s;e things, which you know to be bit|ter after that you have ta&s;ted the honey and the honey-comb; after you have &s;een how good the Lord is. What then &s;hall I call the&s;e motions of your mind? They are the &s;ouls loathing the mor|&s;els which Satan would have it to &s;wallow down: yea, they are the &s;ouls &s;triving with Satan, whil&s;t he would ravi&s;h the &s;pou&s;e of Je&s;us: And let the enemy of all goodne&s;s know, that he &s;hall e're long pay dearly for &s;uch attempts. But you will &s;ay, If the&s;e horrible thoughts be not your &s;in, yet they are your trouble and mi&s;ery, and you de&s;ire to be freed from them; and the mo&s;t loyal and loving &s;pou&s;e had rather be delivered from tho&s;e a&s;&s;aults; but you will a&s;k; How &s;hall I get thee from them ? <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> See that you po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;oul in patience; and know this, that God hath an o|ver-ruling hand in all this: and wait upon him; for he can, and will bring forth good out of this &s;eeming evil. At pre&s;ent, you are in the dark and &s;ee no light: yet, Tru&s;t in the Lord, and &s;tay your|&s;elf upon your God. Can Chri&s;t forget the pur|cha&s;e of his own blood, the price of his &s;oul, tho&s;e whom he hath &s;o intimately endeared to him&s;elf? Can a mother forget her &s;ucking child? Yet, God
<PB N="45" REF="45">cannot forget his, God hath loving and gracious intents in all this, and his bowels yearn towards his. Yea, our Saviour &s;uffers with us, through his ardent love by &s;ympathy, as well as he hath &s;uffered for us. But, for your being rid of the&s;e thoughts, you know who hath all power in his hand, who doth employ this power in a way of love towards his. This power is made yours thro' the prayer of faith: but, for your own work, do this.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let not &s;uch thoughts have any time of abode in your mind: but turn them out, with all the loathing and abhorrence you can; but not &s;o much trouble and di&s;turbance of mind, as, I be|lieve you do. For, by this the Devil is plea&s;ed, and he makes you your own tormentor</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Always then diver your thoughts to &s;ome good thing, and let tho&s;e very injections be con&s;tantly the occa&s;ion of your more &s;piritual me|ditation. Think the quite contrary, or fall a pray|ing with earne&s;tne&s;s and the Devil will be weary, if he find his de&s;igns thus broken, and that tho&s;e &s;parks of hell (which he &s;truck into the &s;oul, to kindle and inflame corruption,) do put warm in-into grace and &s;et faith and prayer a working, when he perceives, that what he intended as water to cool your love to God, proves like oil to make it flame the more vehemently; he will be di&s;coura|ged Thus re&s;i&s;t him, and he will flee from you.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Con&s;ider that this is no new thing: For we are not in this ignorant of &s;atans wiles, that, if any &s;oul hath e&s;caped out of the chains of darkne&s;s, if he will have heaven he &s;hall have it with as much trouble, as the devil can lay on; and, if he and his had their wills, no good man &s;hould have one peaceable hour: But, ble&s;&s;ed be God for his everla&s;ting and unchangeable love to his that the devil cannot pluck us out of tho&s;e almighty
<PB N="46" REF="46">arms, with which he doth embrace his dear children.</P>
<P>Dear heart, my prayer for thee, is, that God would give thee the peaceable fruit of righteou&s;ne&s;s after all thy afflictions; and that thou maye&s;t come out of the&s;e trials, refined and purified and more fit for thy ma&s;ters u&s;e; having this the end of all, to purge away dro&s;s, and take away thy &s;in.</P>
<P>Thus hoping that, at the length, God will turn thy mourning into joy, thy trouble into triumph, and all thy &s;orrows into a &s;ure and &s;table peace I leave you with him, and re&s;t.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours in our dear Lord, <HI>John Janeway.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>He was much afraid of any decays in grace, of a po&s;tacy; yea, of flatne&s;s of &s;pirit, either in him&s;elf or others: and if he &s;u&s;pected any thing of that na|ture in his neare&s;t relations, he would do what he could po&s;&s;ibly, to recover them out of the &s;nares of &s;atan, and to quicken them to higher and more no|ble vigorous &s;piritual acts of religion. He laboured to maintain a con&s;tant tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility up|on his heart, and to take notice of the lea&s;t depart|ure of his &s;oul from God, or Gods ab&s;enting of him|&s;elf from the &s;oul, (which was an expre&s;&s;ion that was much in his mouth.) He had a godly jealou&s;y, over his brother: One of which was awakened by his &s;erious and particular application of him&s;elf to him when he was about eleven years old: but he knew, that conviction and conver&s;ion are two things, and that many are &s;omewhat affected by a warm exhor|tation, who quickly wear off tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, and return to their former trifling with God, and neglect of their &s;ouls. Wherefore, he de&s;ired to carry on the work that he had &s;ome hopes of was well begun:
<PB N="47" REF="47">he laboured to build &s;ure, and build up; that he might be rooted and grounded in the faith &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable always abounding in the work of the Lord. Wherefore he followed him, not only with private warnings, and frequent pathetical coun|&s;els and directions; but with letters, one of which &s;poke in this language.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Another of his Letters, of private Warning and Pathetical Coun&s;el.</HEAD>
<P>YOU live in a place where &s;trict and clo&s;e walking with God, hath few or no exam|ples and mo&s;t are apt to be like their company; and Gods own children are too apt to forget their fir&s;t love: our hearts are apt to be carele&s;s and to ne|glect our watch; we are ready to grow formal in duty or &s;piritual, and then, it may be, le&s;s frequent: and con&s;cience is put off with &s;ome poor excu&s;e: and thus religion withers, and one that &s;eemedonce a zealot may come to be a Laodicean; and &s;ome that looked once as if they were eminent &s;aints, may fall to ju&s;t nothing. It is too common, to have a name to be alive and yet to be dead: Read this, and tremble le&s;t it &s;hould be your ca&s;e. When we are lazy and a&s;leep, our adver&s;ary is awake: when we are &s;lothful and negligent, then he is diligent. I con&s;ider your age, I know where you dwell, I am not unacquainted with your temptations. Wherefore, I cannot but be afraid of you, le&s;t, by both inward and outward fire, the bu&s;h be &s;inged: Though, if God be in it, it cannot be burnt up.</P>
<P>Give me leave to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure fearful of you, and jealous over you, and to mind you of what you know already. Principles of civility will be but as broken reeds, to &s;tay our &s;ouls upon; without tho&s;e higher principles, which are planted in the &s;oul, by the working of the Spirit of God.
<PB N="48" REF="48">O remember what meltings &s;ometimes you have had; remember, how &s;olicitou&s;ly you did enquire after Chri&s;t, how earne&s;tly you &s;eemed to ask the way to Zion with your face thitherward. Oh, take heed of lo&s;ing tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions you once had, take not up with a &s;leight work. True conver|&s;ion is a great thing, and another kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, than mo&s;t of the world take it to be. O therefore be not &s;atisfied with &s;ome convictions, taking them for conver&s;ion: much le&s;s, with re&s;ting in a formal lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a thing as being almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian; nay, as drawing back unto perdition: and &s;ome, that are not far from the kingdom of heaven, may never come there. Beware le&s;t you lo&s;e the reward the promi&s;e is made to him that holdeth fa&s;t, and holdeth out, unto the end and overcometh.</P>
<P>Labour to forget what is behind and to pre&s;s for|ward towards things that are before. He that is contented with ju&s;t grace enough to get to heaven and e&s;cape hell, and de&s;ires no more; may be &s;ure, he hath none at all: and is far from being made partaker of the divine nature. Labour to know what it is, to conver&s;e with God; &s;trive to do every thing, as in his pre&s;ence; de&s;ign in all; act, as one that &s;tands within &s;ight of the grave and eternity. I &s;ay again, do what you do, as if you were &s;ure God &s;tood by and looked upon you, and exactly ob&s;erv|ed and recorded every thought word and action; and you may very well &s;uppo&s;e that, which cannot be otherwi&s;e</P>
<P>Let us awake, and fall to our work in good ear|ne&s;t: Heaven or hell are before us, and death be|hind us. What do we mean to &s;leep! dulne&s;s in Gods &s;ervice is very uncomfortable, and at the be&s;t will co&s;t us dear: and, to be contented with &s;uch a frame, is a certain &s;ymptom of a hypocrite. O, how will &s;uch tremble, when God &s;hall call them to give an account of their &s;teward&s;hip; and tell them,
<PB N="49" REF="49">They may no longer be &s;tewards. Should they fall &s;ick, and the Devil and con&s;cience fall upon them, what inconceivable perplexity would they then be in!</P>
<P>O, live more upon invi&s;ibles and let the thoughts of their excellency put life into your performan|ces. You mu&s;t be contented to be laughed at for preci&s;ene&s;s and &s;ingularity. A Chri&s;tian's walking is not with men but with God; and, he hath great cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his love to God, who doth not delight more in conver&s;ing with God, and being conformed to him, than in conver&s;ing with the world, and being conformed to it.</P>
<P>How can the love of God dwell in that man, who liveth without God in the world? without both continual walking with him in his whole conver&s;ation, and tho&s;e more peculiar vi&s;its of him in prayer, meditation, &s;piritual ejaculations, and other duties of religion; and the workings of faith, love, holy de&s;ires, delight, joy, and &s;piri|tual &s;orrow in them! Think not that our walk|ing with God cannot con&s;i&s;t with worldly bu&s;ine&s;s: yes, but religion makes us &s;piritual in common actions, and there is not an action in a man's life, in which a man is not to labour to make it a reli|gious act, by a looking to the rule in it, and ey|ing of God's glory; and thus he may be &s;aid to walk with God. To this we mu&s;t endeavour to ri&s;e, and never be content till we reach to it, and if this &s;eem tedious (as to degenerate nature it will) we mu&s;t know that we have &s;o much of en|mity again&s;t God &s;till remaining, and are under depravation and darkne&s;s, and know not our true happine&s;s: Such a &s;oul is &s;ick, and it hath lo&s;t its ta&s;te, which doth not perceive an incomparable &s;weetne&s;s in walking with God, without whom all things el&s;e under heaven are gall and bitterne&s;s, and to be little valued by every true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="50">But we are all apt even at the wor&s;t, to &s;ay, that we prefer God above all things; but we mu&s;t know that we have very deceitful hearts: and tho&s;e who, being enlightened, know for what high ends they &s;hould act, and what a fearful condition even a hazard in our ca&s;e, is; the&s;e I &s;ay, will not believe their own hearts without diligent &s;earch and good grounds.</P>
<P>Re&s;t not in any condition in which your &s;ecuri|ty is not founded upon that &s;ure bottom, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>You hear what kind of language he &s;pake; and you may ea&s;ily perceive what it was that &s;wal|lowed up his heart, and where his delight, trea&s;ure, and life was. O how much do mo&s;t of us, who go for Chri&s;tians fall &s;hort of the&s;e things: and how va&s;t a di&s;tance between his experience, and ours; and what rea&s;on have we to read the&s;e lines with blu&s;h|ing, and to blot the paper with tears? and to lay a|&s;ide this book awhile, and to fall upon our faces be|fore the Lord and bemoan the cur&s;ed un&s;uitable|ne&s;s of our hearts unto God; and to bewail that we do &s;o little under&s;tand what this walking with God, and living by faith means! O at what a rate
<PB N="51" REF="51">do &s;ome Chri&s;tians live! and how low, flat, and dull are others.

He never preach|ed publicly but twice, and then he came to it as if he had been u&s;ed to that work forty years; deliver|ing the word of God with that power and maje&s;ty, with that tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, with that rea|dine&s;s and freedom, that it made his hearers almo&s;t amazed: He was led into the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel, and he &s;poke nothing to others but what was the lan|guage of his heart, and the fruit of great experience, and which one might ea&s;ily perceive had no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion fir&s;t upon his own &s;pirit.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t and la&s;t &s;ermons they were upon com|munion and intimate conver&s;e with God, out of Job xxii. 21. A &s;ubject that few Chri&s;tians under heaven were better able to manage than him&s;elf, and
<PB N="52" REF="52">that &s;carce any could handle &s;o feelingly as he; for, he did for &s;ome con&s;iderable time maintain &s;uch an intimate familiarity with God, that he &s;eemed to con|ver&s;e with him, as one friend doth conver&s;e with an|other. This text he made &s;ome entrance into, whil&s;t he was here: but, the perfecting of his acquaintance with God was a work fitter for another world.</P>
<P>He was one that kept an exact watch over his thoughts, words and actions, and made a review of all that pa&s;&s;ed him, at lea&s;t once a day, in a &s;olemn manner He kept a diary in which he did write down every evening what the frame of his &s;pirit had been all the day long, e&s;pecially in every duty. He took notice what incomes and profit he received; in his &s;piritual traffique; what returns from that far coun|try; what an&s;wers of prayer, what deadne&s;s and flatne&s;s, and what ob&s;ervable providences did pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, and the &s;ub&s;tance of what they had been doing; and any wanderings of thoughts, inor|dinancy in any pa&s;&s;ion; which, though the world could not di&s;cern he could. It cannot be conceived by them which do not practi&s;e the &s;ame, to what a good account did this return! This made him to retain a grateful remembrance of mercy, and to live in a con&s;tant admiring and adoring of divine good|ne&s;s; this, brought him to a very intimate acquaint|ance with his own heart; this, kept his &s;pirit low and fitted him for freer communications from God; this made him more lively and active; this helped him to walk humbly with God, this made him &s;peak more affectionately and experimentally to others of the things of God: and in a word, this left a &s;weet calm upon his &s;pirits, becau&s;e he every night made even his accounts; and if his &s;heets &s;hould prove his winding &s;heet, it had been all one: for, he could &s;ay his work was done, &s;o that death could not &s;ur|prize him.</P>
<P>Could this book [of his experiences, and regi&s;ter of his actions] have been read, it might have contri|buted
<PB N="53" REF="53">much to the compleating of this di&s;cour&s;e, and the quickning of &s;ome and the comforting of others. But the&s;e things being written in characters, the world hath lo&s;t that jewel.</P>
<P>He &s;tudied the &s;criptures much, and they were &s;weeter to him than his food; and he had an ex|cellent faculty in opening the mind of God in dark places</P>
<P>In the latter part of his life he &s;eemed quite &s;wal|lowed up with the thoughts of Chri&s;t, heaven, and eternity; and the nearer he came to this the more &s;wift his motion was to it and the more unmixed his de&s;igns for it; and he would much per&s;wade others to an univer&s;al free re&s;pect to the glory of God, in all things; and making religion ones bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to mind the&s;e great things by the by.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP XII.</HI> Mini&s;ters not to carry on low De&s;igns.</HEAD>
<P>HE was not a little concerned about Mini&s;ters; that, above all men, they &s;hould take heed, le&s;t they carried on poor low de&s;igns, in&s;tead of wholly eying of the intere&s;t of God, and &s;ouls. He judged, that, to take up preaching as a trade, was altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the high &s;pirit of a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter: He de&s;ired, that tho&s;e who &s;eem|ed to be devoted to the mini&s;try, would be &s;uch, fir&s;t, heartily to devote their all to God; and then that they &s;hould endeavour to have a dear love to im|mortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>He was very ready to deba&s;e him&s;eif; and hum|bly to acknowledge, what he found ami&s;s in him&s;elf, and laboured to amend him&s;elf and others. <Q>This &s;aith he, I mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly confe&s;s, that I mu&s;t needs reproach my&s;elf for deficiency in a Chri&s;tian &s;pirit|ual remembrance of you (&s;peaking to a dear friend)
<PB N="54" REF="54">and for a decay in a quick tender touch, as of o|ther things, &s;o of what relates to your&s;elf in the &s;pirituality of it. Not that I think not of you or of God; but, that my thoughts of you, and &s;pirit|ual things, are not &s;o frequent, favoury and affec|tionate, as they ought to be.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By this reflection you may ea&s;ily perceive that I &s;ee farther in duty than I do in practice. The truth of it is, I grudge that thoughts and affection &s;hould run out any whither freely, but to God. And what I now de&s;ire for my&s;elf, I de&s;ire for you likewi&s;e, that God would &s;weeten the fountain, our natures I mean, that every drop flowing from thence may &s;avour of &s;omething of God within. Thoughts are precious, affections are more preci|ous, the be&s;t that we are worth; and, when they flow in a wrong channel, all Gods precious di&s;pen&s;a|tions towards us are lo&s;t; all that God hath &s;pent upon us, is lo&s;t, and &s;pent in vanity. I &s;peak this, out of a dear re&s;pect to your &s;oul, and God's ho|nour, whom, I am loath, &s;hould be a lo&s;er by his kindne&s;s I know, you have many objects, upon which you may be too apt to let out your dear af|fections.

If Chri&s;t have my warme&s;t love, why is it thus with me? If God have my heart, why am I &s;o thought ful about the world! If I indeed love him be&s;t.

An evidence is abundantly more than all the trouble that you can be at, in the ac|quiring of it: And the trouble, that there is good ground for, in an unevidenced &s;tate: is far grea|ter than that which may &s;eem to be in &s;earching for it. Yea, to an awakened &s;oul, what is the trouble in clearing its evidences, but their &s;en&s;e or fear of their not being clear, and of the deceitfulne&s;s of their hearts. The reality of that evil, which ten|der &s;ouls &s;o dread, doth lie by in its full weight, (though not felt,) upon the drou&s;ie ungroundedly &s;ecure &s;inner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;peak in love; give me leave, to remember you of &s;ome touches that you had formerly upon your &s;pirit under the means of grace; remember, how much you were &s;ometims affected under preach|ing. Did you never &s;ay that the&s;e &s;ermons upon hardne&s;s of heart, &s;oftened yours? Inquire I pray, whether tho&s;e convictions which were then upon your heart, are not worn off, by the incumbrances of the world: If, upon inquiry, you find that they are, it is high time for you to look about you, and repent, and not only to do your fir&s;t works, but to &s;trive to outgo them</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have with grief, taken a review of the frame of my own &s;pirit, when I was at your hou&s;e; and I have no &s;mall &s;en&s;e of the di&s;temper of my &s;oul, whereby I was betrayed to too great an indifference in the things of God: and, finding by &s;ad experi|ence, that I was more apt (among&s;t tho&s;e carnal comforts and affairs) to lo&s;e that reli&s;h, and &s;avour of divine things that I was wont to have; and tho&s;e delightful appearances of God which I was through rich grace, acquainted with, while I was more &s;e|que&s;tred from the world and earthly delights [not but that I find my heart at the be&s;t, under the high|e&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="56">advantages of clo&s;e&s;t communion, too unwilling to endeavour after, and maintain that gracious &s;en&s;e and acknowledgement of God which I would fain obtain unto:] I &s;ay, ob&s;erving mine own ex|periences, and knowing that your heart was &s;ome|thing akin to mine, fearing le&s;t multiplicity of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;hould expo&s;e you al&s;o, to the &s;ame hazard; chri&s;tian pa&s;&s;ion could not but put me upon arming of you again&s;t tho&s;e temptations, to which your occa&s;ions make you &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The de&s;ire of my &s;oul for you is, that you may travel &s;afely through a dangerous wilderne&s;s, to a ble&s;&s;ed Canaan; that you may quit your&s;elf like a Chri&s;tian in the oppo&s;ing and conquering all your enemies; and, at la&s;t, come triumphing out of the field, and that you may behave your&s;elf like a pil|grim and &s;tranger in a far country, who are look|ing for a city that hath foundations; and that we may meet together with joy at our fathers hou&s;e, and &s;it down with him in eternal glory. O that word glory is &s;o weighty, if we did believe, that it would make the greate&s;t diligence we can u&s;e to &s;ecure it &s;eem light. O that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory! O for more faith! Lord, increa&s;e our faith and then there would be nothing wanting to make us put forth the utmo&s;t &s;trength of our &s;oul, and to improve every moment of time, to catch hold of all advantages and to make u&s;e of all means po&s;&s;ible for the attainment of &s;uch glorious ends.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, O the&s;e unbelieving hearts! let us join our complaints and let us all break out into bitter la|mentations over them. May not we, with as good rea&s;on as that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed father over his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed child, bring our hearts into the pre&s;ence of our Sa|viour, and cry out with tears, and &s;ay, that it is the&s;e unbelieving hearts, which &s;ometimes ca&s;t us into the fire, and &s;ometimes into the water: Yea wor&s;e, every time we for&s;ake God, and prefer any
<PB N="57" REF="57">thing before him, we part with life for death, with heaven for hell.</Q></P>
<P>Give me leave to come yet a little nearer to you: <Q>What an advantage would a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth and excellency of go&s;pel di&s;coveries, bring to your &s;oul, if you would but &s;eriou&s;ly, and with all your &s;trength, drive on true &s;piritual de&s;igns. O, how ea&s;ily might you then go under all your burdens. If your care for the things of this world were but rightly &s;ubordinate to the things of eter|nity how chearfully might you go on with your bu&s;ine&s;s! If you &s;ought <HI>fir&s;t the kingdom of heaven and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof;</HI> then all other things would be added (&s;o far as they are nece&s;&s;ary or good for you.)</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let me therefore at this time put you upon that duty of rai&s;ing your mind from earth to heaven, from the creature to the Creator, from the world to God. Indeed, it is a matter of no &s;mall diffi|culty, to di&s;cover that di&s;order that is in our &s;ouls, when we are &s;olicitous about temporary objects, and employments: But, there are but few &s;urer di&s;coveries of it, than in&s;en&s;ibility and not com|plaining of it. For, when the &s;oul is indeed rai|&s;ed to &s;piritual objects, and to under&s;tand clearly its eternal intere&s;t; when it doth in good earne&s;t, take God for its portion, and prefer him above all, then it will quickly be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ouls out|goings after other objects, and even grudge that any time &s;hould be taken up in the pur&s;uit of the creature, and that any below God &s;hould be fol|lowed with earne&s;t plea&s;ure and con&s;tancy. It would have God have the be&s;t, and it would do nothing el&s;e but love, &s;erve, and enjoy God. For my own part, I cannot but wonder that God will give us leave to love him. O ble&s;&s;ed goodne&s;s! O infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion! Tho&s;e that believingly &s;eek him he is not a&s;hamed to be called their God. I am &s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea&s;ure of your burdens, and
<PB N="58" REF="58">indeed that mu&s;t needs be a burden that keeps the &s;oul from pur&s;uing its chiefe&s;t good. My prayers for you are that you may have &s;uch teachings from God as may make you under&s;tand how far heaven|ly things are more precious than earthly, and that you may with all your might &s;eek, mind, and love that which hath mo&s;t of true excellency in it, which hath the only ground of real comfort here, and of eternal happine&s;s hereafter.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> His Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to Souls.</HEAD>
<P>HE was full of pity and compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ouls, and yet greatly grieved and a&s;hamed that he did no more to expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of the worth of &s;ouls and that his bowels did no more &s;en&s;ibly yearn over them, who he had ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear, were in a chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate. Though there were few of his kindred and relations, nay of his neighbours and acquaintances but he did make a per&s;onal application to, either by letters or conference: Yet, for all this, who more ready to cry out of the want of love to &s;ouls, and unprofitablene&s;s to others in his generation, that he was no more full of compa&s;&s;ion, and that he made no better improvement of all the vi&s;its that he made; in which, we &s;hould not make carnal plea&s;ure and recreation our end, but the imparting and receiving of &s;ome &s;piritual gift. This made him, after a con|&s;iderable ab&s;ence from a dear friend, to groan out the&s;e complaints. <Q>God by his providence hath oft brought us together; but to how little purpo&s;e, God and our con&s;ciences know. As for my part, I may ju&s;tly bewail my barrenne&s;s. Oh, that I &s;hould be of &s;o little u&s;e where I come! Oh, that my tongue and heart &s;hould be &s;till &s;o unfruitful&punc; I am ready to hope &s;ometimes, that, if it &s;hould
<PB N="59" REF="59">plea&s;e God in his providence to bring us again to|gether, we may be more profitable one to ano|ther.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And this indeed makes me more de&s;irous of coming to you again, than any thing el&s;e, That I may do &s;ome good among you. Oh, how few &s;tudy to advance the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and the be|nefit of one anothers &s;ouls in their vi&s;its, as they &s;hould and might do! I am not able, at pre&s;ent, to order my affairs &s;o as to come comfortably over to you, but I hope, e're long, the Lord will give me leave to &s;ee you, and be refre&s;hed by you, I de&s;ire to &s;upply my ab&s;ence by this &s;ure token of my remembrance of you, and al&s;o that I might have an opportunity for that which we ought to eye mo&s;t in the enjoyment of one anothers &s;ocie|ty. But I have found, that partly becau&s;e of the narrowne&s;s of my heart, not being enlarged to bring forth into act what I have greatly de&s;i|red, partly becau&s;e of the malice of the ene|my of our &s;ouls, who endeavours all that po&s;|&s;ible he can, to lay &s;tumbling blocks in our way to real union and nearer acquaintance with God and Chri&s;tian communion: from the&s;e, and other cau&s;es, it is, that I have been too little beneficial to you formerly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may be, I may write that with freedom, which in pre&s;ence I &s;hould not have &s;poken. I &s;hall take occa&s;ion from your de&s;ire of my pre|&s;ence with you to look higher to the de&s;ires of our &s;ouls to be in conjunction and communion with the highe&s;t good, who fills up all relations to our &s;ouls; who is our Father, our Husband, our Friend, our God; yea our all in all. But, when I &s;ay, He is all in all, I mean more than that which we count all; for every one doth confe&s;s, that it is God alone, that doth ble&s;s all other things to us, and that it is not of the nature of tho&s;e things that we enjoy, that they are ble&s;&s;ings; but it is God
<PB N="60" REF="60">which makes them comforts to us. And thus God is to be acknowledged, <HI>All in all common enjoy|ment!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But, be&s;ides this, God is &s;omething to the &s;oul, which he is by him&s;elf, and not in the mediation of the creatures; where God is a portion, and lived upon as our true happine&s;s; He is, not on|ly the compliment of other things, but he him&s;elf is the &s;oul's &s;ufficiency. I am a little ob&s;cure, I de&s;ire to be plainer, I mean, that through the di&s;|pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, God is to be lived upon, delighted in, and cho&s;en before all: for, for this very end, hath Chri&s;t appeared, that he might make God approachable by man, and that we who are afar off, may be made nigh.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is a nearne&s;s to God which we are not only allowed, but called to in the loving di&s;pen&s;a|tions of the go&s;pel, &s;o that now we are not to be &s;trangers any longer, but friends; we are to have fellow&s;hip and communion with God. Why do not our hearts even leap for joy? why do not our &s;ouls triumph in the&s;e di&s;coveries of love? Even becau&s;e we know not the greatne&s;s of our privi|leges, the highne&s;s of our calling, the excellency of our advancement, the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of this life, the &s;weetne&s;s of the&s;e employments, the &s;atisfaction of the&s;e enjoyments, the comfort of this heavenly life, the delights of this communion with God. We know not the things which belong to our peace; and thus when God calls us to that which he &s;ent his Son for, when Chri&s;t offers us, that which co&s;t him &s;o dear; we with the greate&s;t unworthine&s;s, the vi|le&s;t ingratitude, refu&s;e, &s;light, and contemn it. What think we! doth it not go even to the heart of Chri&s;t; and (to &s;peak after the manner of men) doth it not grieve him to the &s;oul to behold his greate&s;t love &s;corned, and the end of his agony to be more vilely accounted of than the ba&s;e&s;t of our lu&s;ts?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61"><Q>Let us therefore according to that high calling wherewith we are called, enter into a more inti|mate acquaintance with God, and as we find our &s;ouls acting naturally towards tho&s;e things, which are naturally dear to us; &s;o let us &s;trive to lighten our &s;piritual affections.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are very apt to look upon duties as burdens rather than privileges and &s;ea&s;ons of enjoying the greate&s;t refre&s;hments; but the&s;e apprehen&s;ions are very low and earthly. O that we could at length &s;et our&s;elves to live a &s;piritual life, to walk with God, and out of a new nature, to &s;avour and re|li&s;h tho&s;e things which are above! Could we but really, inten&s;ely, believingly de&s;ire that which is real happine&s;s, and the heaven of heaven, union and communion with God; the&s;e de&s;ires would bring in &s;ome comfort.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As for me, you mu&s;t give me allowance to get my affections more emptied into God; tho'it be with a diminution of love to you; and ble&s;&s;ed will that day be, when all love will be fully &s;wallowed up into God But &s;piritual love doth not de&s;troy natural affections, or relative obligations, but per|fect and rectify them; and &s;o I may, giving up my&s;elf to God be &s;till yours.</Q></P>

That the folly of common di&s;cour&s;e among Chri&s;ti|ans might appear more, and that he might di&s;cover how little &s;uch language did become tho&s;e that pro|fe&s;s them&s;elves I&s;raelites, and that &s;ay, they are Jews; he once &s;at down &s;ilent and took out his pen and ink, and wrote down in &s;hort-hand the di&s;cour&s;es that pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ometime together, among&s;t tho&s;e who pretended to more than common under&s;tanding in the things of God: and after a while he took his pa|per and read it to them, and a&s;ked them whether &s;uch talk was &s;uch as they would be willing God &s;hould record.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Two Letters to cement Differences, and cau&s;e Love among Chri&s;tians.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>IT cannot be expected that wounds &s;hould be healed till their cau&s;e be removed; that which moveth me to write to you, at pre&s;ent and puts me upon intentions of writing again, is, that I may do my utmo&s;t, by mouth and pen, for the removal of that which is the cau&s;e of inward grief and trouble of my &s;oul, and, I am per&s;uaded, of others al&s;o as well as mine, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e divi&s;ions, that I could not but ob&s;erve to be between your&s;elf and another Chri&s;tian friend. I hope, after my a&s;king coun&s;el not only of my own heart, but of God al&s;o; he hath directed me to that which may be to his own
<PB N="64" REF="64">glory, and the good of your &s;oul; and not only for the removing of grief, but the rejoycing of the hearts of them upon whom former divi&s;ions had any effect.</P>
<P>I therefore de&s;ire you to entertain the&s;e following lines, as the i&s;&s;ues of deep affection to your &s;oul, and the honour of religion: and I be&s;eech you read them, not only as from me who de&s;ire your good with the &s;trength of my &s;oul, but as from God him|&s;elf of who&s;e love your good improvement will be a token. That end which I propo&s;e to my&s;elf, I cannot but per&s;wade my&s;elf, you your&s;elf de&s;ign, commend and de&s;ire; which, Chri&s;tian charity and that &s;weet meek go&s;pel &s;pirit, which is &s;o highly and frequently commended by our Saviour to the prac|tice of his di&s;ciples. O that, where there hath been any breaches, there might be the nearer uni|on: and that ye might be joined together in the &s;ame &s;pirit, might keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace.</P>
<P>And for this end that you would remove all old hindrances: watch continually le&s;t you give, and be careful not to take occa&s;ion of offence. The nece&s;&s;ity, u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;weetne&s;s of true &s;piritual love appears by the word of Gods frequent urging of it, by the &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;tians, the uncomfortablene&s;s and deformity of the contrary. Now, that you may in an unintermitted con&s;tancy enjoy peace with|in and without and rejoice my &s;oul; I de&s;ire you to join your own endeavours with the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e things which I &s;hall now and hereafter &s;end to you</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Con&s;ider, that it is a Chri&s;tian's duty to go out of him&s;elf, to lay down his own ends and inter|e&s;ts, and wholly to take upon him God's cau&s;e, to do all for God, and to act as under God, and to be God's in&s;trument in our &s;ouls and bodies which are God's. Thus did God create man for his own glory and not that man &s;hould &s;eek him&s;elf: And when
<PB N="65" REF="65">man fell, he fell out of God into him&s;elf; out of that divine order and compo&s;ure of mind in which God had made him, into confu&s;ion; from a love of God, into a corrupt &s;elf-love and &s;elf &s;eeking. Now if we do but de&s;cend into our &s;ouls, and ob&s;erve the actings, intents, and contrivances of them, we cannot but ob&s;erve how confu&s;edly and abominably all work together for the pampering, plea&s;ing, and advancing of &s;elf. We are not to think that if we do not pre&s;ently di&s;cover this in our&s;elves, that it is not &s;o with us: For, in &s;ome degree it is in every one, even in the truly regene|rate, as far as they have the relics of corruption in them, &s;o far they have in their &s;ouls this &s;elf-love. Now this di&s;order in our minds whereby they are taken off from their right ends is that very natural corruption and depravedne&s;s which we received from Adam, and it is, and, to a &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e, ought to be, wor&s;e than hell it&s;elf; in as much as the cau&s;e doth eminently contain all and more evil than the effect.</P>
<P>This is the &s;piritual death, whereby we are dead in &s;in, the fruit of the fir&s;t cur&s;e, <HI>Thou &s;halt die the death.</HI> The &s;oul's life in this world, is its be|ing in God, and living in God, and enjoyment of God; and the &s;oul's eternal life will be, &s;o to know God as to be formed into his likene&s;s, and to be received into a full participation of, and communion with God. The &s;oul's death here, is its being fallen off from God, and its beings car|ried into it&s;elf; and its eternal death will be, an utter &s;eparation from him.</P>
<P>Now mankind being thus fallen from God, Chri&s;t is &s;ent for this very end, to bring man back again to God; and then man is brought unto God, when he is brought out of that &s;tate of &s;elf love into that &s;tate whereby he gives up him&s;elf to God. Thus the &s;ouls being quickned by the Spirit of God, leaveth off living to it&s;elf, which was its death;
<PB N="66" REF="66">and lives to God, which is its life, Here comes in the great duty of denying of our&s;elves for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; which indeed were no duty, if there were nothing in us contrary to God.</P>
<P>This then is our duty not to &s;eek our own things, before the things of God; to lay God's glory at the foundation of all our actions, and if there be any thing in us contrary to that, to give it no leave to &s;tand in competition to God.</P>
<P>Now, were this deeply rooted in our hearts, how would contention, anger, wrath, and heart-burn|ing and all things of this nature cea&s;e? Such in|fluence would the taking God's part again&s;t &s;elf have into the quiet and peace of men, that it can|not be without it.</P>
<P>We &s;ee how wi&s;ely God hath ordered things, that the very act of man's being off from God, &s;hould be the cau&s;e of confu&s;ion, war, and mi&s;ery: and what can be more ju&s;t and equal than this, that God, who is the author of our being, &s;hould be the end of our being? O then, that once our minds were again reduced to this frame, <HI>To live wholly to God?</HI> O that we were wrought into a thorough prejudice again&s;t &s;elf which &s;tands be|tween us and true peace! I beg of you to &s;pare &s;ome time from the world, and return into priva|cy, where you may apply this to your own &s;oul.</P>
<P>My prayer to God for you, out of the &s;trong yearnings of my &s;oul toward you is, that he would make this effectual to its intended end, for the in|ward peace of your &s;oul, for your comfortable walking with God, in this life, and that condition wherein the wi&s;dom of God hath placed you. I write the&s;e lines with the &s;trength of affection; I feel fear, grief, compa&s;&s;ion, working &s;trongly. O pity me in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e, whil&s;t I cannot call to remembrance the cau&s;e of the&s;e without a flood of tears. <HI>Fulfil therefore my joy, in being of one mind: yea, if there be any con&s;olation in Chri&s;t,
<PB N="67" REF="67">if any comfort in love, if any fellow&s;hip of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercy; fulfil ye my joy, and be like|minded, having the &s;ame love, being of one accord, of one mind,</HI> Phil. ii. 1, 2. I leave you to the love and mercy of God, and to the working of his Spi|rit, which alone is able to put life and power into the&s;e words. Which that he would do, is the ear|ne&s;t reque&s;t, and fervent prayer of yours,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now, upon a faithful peru&s;al of this letter, it plea|&s;ed the Lord to give a meek and more complying &s;pirit, and in a great mea&s;ure it wrought its intend|ed effect. The noble de&s;ign of this &s;weet peace-ma|ker, took &s;o far as to produce an ingenious acknow|ledgment, and &s;orrowful bewailing of the want of that &s;elf-denial, humility, meekne&s;s, and love, which doth &s;o much become our &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion. Upon the hearing of this good news, how &s;trangely was this good man tran&s;ported! Upon the receipt of a letter from the former friend, which gave no &s;mall &s;atisfaction and hopes that his former endeavours were not in vain. And, that he might drive the nail to the head, he &s;peedily backs his former letter with a &s;econd; which &s;peaks the&s;e words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY &s;oul is enlarged towards you and my affec|tions work within me; and yet give me leave now to lay a&s;ide &s;o weak flames of natural affection, and to kindle my &s;oul with divine love Here there is no fear of running out too far while all is in Chri&s;t, and for Chri&s;t. O that now I could let out the &s;trength of my &s;oul, not as to your&s;elf but as to God! O that my heart were more enlarged, that it may be comprehen&s;ive of a more full true Chri&s;tian love!
<PB N="68" REF="68">God is altogether lovely, and to be loved for him|&s;elf, and we are &s;o far dark, ignorant, and blind, as we do not &s;ee and account him mo&s;t amiable. O let me have &s;uch di&s;coveries of his excellency, that my heart may pant; thir&s;t and break for its earne&s;t longings after the riche&s;t participations of him; that I may for ever be &s;wallowed up of his love! O that I may love him a thou&s;and times more than I do! That I may rejoice in him, and take the &s;weete&s;t complacency and delight in him alone; and that I could let out my affections mo&s;t, where I &s;ee any thing of him&s;elf, any beams of the image of his holine&s;s, and that beareth the impre&s;&s;ion of his &s;pi|rit. Had you vi&s;ited me from the dead, could my affections have moved more &s;trongly, or my rejoic|ing have been greater than they were at the receipt of tho&s;e lines which I had from you, wherein &s;o much of Chri&s;t in you, and the goodne&s;s of Chri&s;t to me did appear. Fulfil my joy in the Lord, re|fre&s;h my bowels, and let not my rejoicing be in vain. If it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to make the im|perfect and weak endeavours of his unworthy &s;er|vant, any way &s;ub&s;ervient to his own glory in you, it is that which I account my&s;elf unworthy of, and de&s;ire to receive it from him as a manife&s;tation of the riches of his free goodne&s;s to my&s;elf; know|ing my&s;elf to be unworthy to be his in&s;trument in the meane&s;t &s;ervice, much more in &s;o great a one as this is. Hoping and per&s;uading my&s;elf of the effectual work of my former letter, I am encoura|ged to write again both becau&s;e of my promife, and your expectation, and the weighty nature of the &s;ubject that I was then upon, which was, <HI>love.</HI> True Chri&s;tian love, which is a thing &s;o comely, &s;o beautiful and &s;weet, and of &s;uch weighty power all actions to make them divine and excellent, that there is no labour lo&s;t in endeavouring to get more of it, even in tho&s;e in whom it mo&s;t aboundeth.
<PB N="69" REF="69">The apo&s;tle, 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 9, 10. Though he knew that they were taught of God to love one another, and that they did it towards all the brethren, yet, e|ven them he be&s;eecheth to abound more and more in that grace of love. The former principle out of which this love doth ari&s;e (as I informed you in my former letter) was the putting off our own intere&s;ts and putting on God's Now I &s;hall proceed in mind|ing you of another Chri&s;tian duty, which is effectual to the knitting us together in a firm operative love, and that is this; that a Chri&s;tian is to walk as one that is a member of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Into what near and clo&s;e union are tho&s;e that are given him by the fa|ther received! How hath the Holy Gho&s;t cho&s;en out all the neare&s;t natural relations to expre&s;s and &s;hadow out the clo&s;ene&s;s of that &s;piritual relation that is between Chri&s;t and his! Chri&s;t is our king and we his people, he is our ma&s;ter and we are his &s;ervants, he is our &s;hepherd and we the &s;heep of his pa&s;ture, he is our friend and we his, he is our hu&s;|band and we are his &s;pou&s;e; he the vine we the bran|ches, he our head and we are his members, he is in us and we in him, he is our life. This duty will have influence upon our affections the&s;e ways.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As Chri&s;t is our head and we are his mem|bers, &s;o he hath an ab&s;olute command over us. And where this relation is real, obedience to the com|mands of Chri&s;t is &s;weet and without con&s;traint and force; now this is Chri&s;t's command that we &s;hould love one another; by this &s;aith he &s;hall all men know you are my di&s;ciples if you love one another. Tho&s;e relations into which Chri&s;t, receiveth his, &s;peak and hold forth a willing cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the commands of Chri&s;t, and what duty is there in all the go&s;pel which is more frequently and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed than this. A new commandment give I un|to you that you love one another as I have loved you, &s;o love one another. So full is the whole &s;cripture of obligations, both upon con&s;cience and ingenuity
<PB N="70" REF="70">to this duty, that the whole &s;tream of it &s;eems to run into this channel of love. But Chri&s;t's command is &s;uch an obligation as one that hath any &s;piritual &s;en&s;e to feel the &s;trength of it, cannot break It is Chri&s;t hath commanded, and &s;hall not we obey? Shall not the love of Chri&s;t con&s;train us? Shall we be &s;o un|kind to him who hath been &s;o kind to us, as to &s;tand it out with him in &s;o equal a command? Shall not the &s;weetne&s;s of Chri&s;t overcome us, that &s;eeing his love was &s;o great, as not to &s;pare his life for us, yea, and &s;uffer more for us I believe than we think he did nay, I may &s;ay than we can conceive he did, and that which commands his love to us is, that he &s;hould do and &s;uffer &s;o much for us, that of his crea|tures we were become his enemies? Why &s;hould we not then cheerfully &s;ubmit to him in this one com|mand, love one another? Doth not the very word love carry in it at the fir&s;t hearing abundance of al|luring violence! This is Chri&s;t's yoke, and here we may well &s;ay, his yoke is ea&s;ie and his burden is light. What is there in a life of divine love that we need be afraid of? What is there in this command that is grievous? How can this yoke be unea&s;ie? What rea&s;on to be loath to take it on? But &s;uch is the ba&s;e degeneracy and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of corrupted nature that when any thing comes in competition with &s;elf-love, then all bonds mu&s;t be broken, all yokes mu&s;t be broken, all yokes mu&s;t be ca&s;t of, and nothing will then keep us in, but we mu&s;t and will take our own part though never &s;o bad. And our own part in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t &s;eem be&s;t, though it be contrary to infinite righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is God him|&s;elf. O that we could once learn to lay a&s;ide this na|tural prejudice which we have again&s;t what&s;oever doth thwart our humours, though it be never &s;o ju&s;t holy and rational. O that we could look more narrowly and &s;earch more exactly into our&s;elves, and to be|come abominable in our own eyes, and rather take any part than our own, we &s;hould &s;ee &s;o much de|ceitfulne&s;s
<PB N="71" REF="71">in our&s;elves, as that we &s;hould think our ca&s;e bad though it &s;eem never &s;o good to our natur|al &s;elf, till we apply it to the rule. Rule, nature would have none but it&s;elf; and though in our bet|ter compo&s;ure of mind, we may receive &s;ome other rule; yet in our pa&s;&s;ions we cannot &s;pare time to go to any other rule, but we take that which is next to hand, and &s;elf will be &s;ure to be that. But we mu&s;t, if we will be true Chri&s;tians, learn to deny &s;elf, and wholly to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the command of Chri&s;t, as our only rule. O, let the power of Chri&s;t's love, and command, make us obedient to this command of love!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If we are to walk as members of Chri&s;t, who is our head; this hath influence upon our af|fections to oblige us to love one another, as, from the command which the head hath over the mem|bers, &s;o, from the conformity that is to be in the members to the head. The head and the members are not of two &s;everal natures, but the &s;ame nature pa&s;&s;eth from the head through all the members: Now if we be ingrafted into Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t become of the &s;ame nature with him. Let us be <HI>followers of Chri&s;t as dear children, and walk in love, as Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us.</HI> Paul bids us to be followers of him|&s;elf, as he was a follower of Chri&s;t; Chri&s;t then is to be our great pattern: He commands us to learn of him, for he was meek. For us to think to attain unto a perfect conformity to him, is in vain; but, as much as our natures are capable of, we are to &s;trive for it. Chri&s;t's love to us hath breadth, and length, and depth, and height, which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge. <HI>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man &s;hould lay down his life for his friend; but herein Chri&s;t com|mended his love to us, in that, while we were enemies, Chri&s;t died for us,</HI> Behold what manner of love is this, that Chri&s;t hath be&s;towed on us! Here|by perceive we the love for God, that is Chri&s;t be|cau&s;e he laid down his life for us, 1 John iii. 16.
<PB N="72" REF="72">His inference is there the &s;ame with mine, and that in a higher degree; <HI>we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</HI> If life, then &s;in; then pa&s;&s;ion and wrath; then a ba&s;e, proud, &s;elf-plea&s;ing and contradicting humour. Do we &s;ee any loveline&s;s or beauty in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Is there no excellency in his &s;weetne&s;s, pity, and patience? Is not his loving|kindne&s;s amiable? And would not &s;omething like this in us, be de&s;irable? Had he more rea&s;on to love us than we have to love one another? O, let our &s;ouls be overcome with the thoughts of this love of Chri&s;t: let our hearts be kindled and blown up to a flame of love, by it O, when &s;hall this dear, precious pure, eternal love of his, overpower our &s;ouls? When &s;hall its have it proper effect upon us, to make us to de&s;ire earne&s;tly to be like our beloved! When &s;hall we put on his beauty! O how lovely &s;hould we then look! Let us put off that deformity that is upon our &s;ouls, which makes us &s;o unlike to Chri&s;t; yea, which makes us loath&s;ome in his eyes. Pride, pa&s;&s;ion, worldline&s;s, are the &s;oul-de formities, which keep Chri&s;t at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, and which hinder his more &s;weet, frequent, and intimate conver&s;e with us.</P>
<P>It is only that of him&s;elf which Chri&s;t &s;eeth in us, which he delighteth in. For, in him is the perfec|tion of all beauty and excellency, and what&s;oever loveline&s;s is in any thing el&s;e, comes from him, is like him, and leads to him. Would we know, how much we are beloved of him, let us &s;ee how much we are like him; for he cannot but love that which is like him&s;elf, and if we would be like him, we mu&s;t put on love, for <HI>God is love, and he that dwel|leth in love dwelleth in God and God in him,</HI> 1 John iv. 16.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If we ought to walk towards one another as members of the &s;ame body, whereof Chri&s;t is the head, what can &s;peak a clo&s;er union than commem|ber&s;hip? No man ever yet hated his own fle&s;h, but
<PB N="73" REF="73">nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it. But we do not feel the power of this onene&s;s, as we ought to do. We are many; and where there is divi&s;ion, there will be di&s;&s;ention; that we may therefore be more one, let us be more in putting off our&s;elf. and going in|to Chri&s;t. Here, let us look into the loath&s;omne&s;s of our natures, whil&s;t off from God; which is the cau&s;e of all this confu&s;ion, and if we cannot &s;ee its de|formity in it&s;elf, let us &s;ee it in reflection in its bit|ter effects; and when we &s;ee our own deformity, we &s;hall &s;ee le&s;s cau&s;e to love our&s;elves, and more cau&s;e to love others, than Chri&s;t had to love us. Let us look upon our onene&s;s in Chri&s;t, and &s;ee if we can thence become one in affections. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>I and the children which thou ha&s;t given me;</HI> we have one &s;piritual Father, we are brethren; let us love as brethren. The cau&s;e of this union is our being made partakers of Chri&s;t's nature, and baptized into the &s;ame &s;pirit with him: and, if we have at any time experienced the more lively and full incomes of this Spirit of Chri&s;t, how did it &s;et the heart on fire! The &s;oul is then too narrow to con|tain its own affections; how dearly then could we look upon a &s;aint! How would pride and wrath va|ni&s;h, and melt down into meekne&s;s, humility, and love! Did we never experience what this meaneth? Then, let the remembrance of the &s;weetne&s;s of it, renew it in us. O, a life of &s;piritual love is a life indeed, a heaven upon earth! This is a good rule; when we find our&s;elves in a &s;piritual temper, let us examine our&s;elves then, and enquire how we like &s;uch a frame: let us remember the voice of the &s;pirit in us, and labour to have our judgment and affections always after, &s;o ballanced.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Are we members of Chri&s;t, we do not &s;ay, we do not love Chri&s;t. If we do indeed love Chri&s;t, let us love him wherever we find him. Chri&s;t is in all tho&s;e that are his. Let us fear offending Chri&s;t in his, for what is done to them, he will take as done to him&s;elf. It will be &s;aid in that great day,
<PB N="74" REF="74"><HI>In as much as ye did it unto the&s;e, ye did it unto me.</HI> Let us think what we will of it at pre&s;ent, the world will find this true to their co&s;t. And, if we act as in Chri&s;t, we &s;hall find our&s;elves as much concerned for him, as for our&s;elves, and more too. Oh the wrongs that are done to him, we &s;hall reckon done to us. If we are Chri&s;ts, Chri&s;t's intere&s;t will be ours, and his injuries will be ours. If we are Chri&s;t's, we will be as fearful of offending any of his, as of wronging our&s;elves. Chri&s;t him&s;elf is above the reach of our wrongs, to be touched by them in him&s;elf; but, in his members he &s;uffers to this very day. If then Chri&s;t and we are one, and Chri&s;t and all his are one; let us love Chri&s;t in his, let us rejoice in Chri&s;t in his members, let us endea|vour to requite Chri&s;t in his members: let us fear grieving the Spirit of Chri&s;t, in grieving the &s;pirits of any of his dear ones. Wound not Chri&s;t in wounding the heart of his Beloved. O the preci|ou&s;ne&s;s, plea&s;ure, and profit of this love, I beg of God to give you a full enjoyment of that &s;weetne&s;s and the joyful fruits of it, the Lord refre&s;h you with a quick and con&s;tant &s;en&s;e and &s;ight of his eternal love towards your &s;oul; to which the a&s;&s;urance of true Chri&s;tian love by the effectual work of the Com|forter, may bring you. By this we know, that we are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren. If it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to give me leave to &s;ee you again, I &s;hall come with &s;trong expecta|tions, and earne&s;t de&s;ires of &s;eeing a &s;weet alteration for the better in you, in your deportment, and car|riage towards one that did de&s;erve better at your hands. And what an effect hopes of this nature fru&s;trated, will produce; I be&s;eech you to judge. I pray God fill you with peace and joy. My hand is weary with writing, but my mind &s;till runs forth in de&s;ires and prayers for you. I hope the Lord will take away all cau&s;e of writing any more of this &s;ub|ject unto you. Your letter gave my hopes a good

I leave you in the arms of love.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>By all this you may ea&s;ily perceive what &s;pirit acted him, and how much he was troubled for any divi&s;ions among&s;t the people of God. Indeed, he was of &s;o loving, and lovely a di&s;po&s;ition, that he even commanded the affections of mo&s;t that knew him; and &s;o humble he was, that he was a&s;hamed to be loved for his own &s;ake.</P>
<P>I can never forget a &s;trange expre&s;&s;ion, that I have heard from him, concerning one that had a very ardent love for him. <HI>I know this,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that I love no love but what is purely for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, I would Chri&s;t might have all the love, he alone de&s;erves it: for my part, I am afraid and a&s;hamed of the love and re&s;pect of Chri&s;tians.</HI> He &s;aw &s;o much pride, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and divi&s;ion among profe&s;&s;ors, that it did not a little vex his righteous &s;oul, and made him think long, to be in a &s;weeter air, where there &s;hould be nothing but union, joy, and love. He could not endure to hear Chri&s;tians &s;peak reproach|fully one of another, becau&s;e they were of different judgments and per&s;ua&s;ions. There where he &s;aw mo&s;t holine&s;s, humility, and love, there he let out mo&s;t of his affections. And he was of that holy man's mind, that it were pity that the very name of divi&s;ion were not buried; and that the time would come, that we might all dearly pay for our unbro|therly nay unchri&s;tian animo&s;ities.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> An Account of the latter Part of his Life.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the latter part of his life; he loved like a man that was quite weary of the world, and that looked upon him&s;elf as a &s;tranger here, and that lived in the con&s;tant &s;ight of a better world. He plainly declared him&s;elf but a pilgrim that look|ed for a better country, a city that had foundati|ons, who&s;e builder and maker was God. His habit, his language, his deportment, all &s;poke him one of another world. His meditations were &s;o inten&s;e, long, and frequent, that they ripened him apace for heaven, but &s;omewhat weakned his body. Few Chri&s;tians attain to &s;uch a holy contempt of the world, and to &s;uch clear believing, joyful, con&s;tant appre|hen&s;ions of the tran&s;cendent glories of the un&s;een world.</P>
<P>He made it his whole bu&s;ine&s;s to keep up &s;en&s;i|ble communion with God, and to grow unto a hum|ble familiarity with God, and to maintain it. And if by rea&s;on of company or any nece&s;&s;ary diver&s;i|ons, this was in any mea&s;ure interrupted; he would complain, like one out of his element, till his &s;pirit was recovered into a delightful, more unmixed free intercour&s;e with God. He was never &s;o well &s;ati&s;|fied, as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer to God; and by this he enjoyed tho&s;e comforts frequently, which other Chri&s;tians rarely meet with. His graces and expe|riences, toward his end grew to a&s;toni&s;hment. His faith got up to a full a&s;&s;urance; his de&s;ires into a kind of enjoyment and delight. He was oft brought into the banquetting hou&s;e, and there Chri&s;t's ban|ner over him was love; and he &s;at down under his &s;hadow with great delight, and his fruit was
<PB N="77" REF="77">plea&s;ant unto his ta&s;te. His eyes beheld the king in his beauty, and while he &s;at at his table, his &s;pick|nard did &s;end forth its plea&s;ant &s;mell: he had frequent vi&s;ions of glory, and this John lay in the bo&s;om of his ma&s;ter, and was &s;ure a very be|loved di&s;ciple and highly favoured. His Lord oft called him up to the mount to him, and let him &s;ee his excellent glory, O the &s;weet fore|ta&s;tes that he had of tho&s;e plea&s;ures that are at the right hand of God. How oft was he fea&s;ted with the fea&s;t of fat things tho&s;e wines on the lees well refin|ed; and &s;ometimes he was like a giant refre&s;ht with new wine, rejoicing to run the race that was &s;et before him, whether of doing or &s;uffering. He was even &s;ick of love, and he could &s;ay to the poor unex|perienced world, <HI>O ta&s;te and &s;ee!</HI> and to Chri&s;tians, <HI>come and I will tell you what God hath done for my &s;oul.</HI> O what do Chri&s;tians mean, that they do not more to get their &s;en&s;es &s;pirtually exerci&s;ed! O why do they not make religion the very bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, O why are the &s;oul, Chri&s;t and glory thus de&s;pi&s;ed? Is there nothing in communion with God? Are all tho&s;e comforts of Chri&s;tians, that follow hard after him, worth nothing? Is it not worth the while to make ones calling and election &s;ure! O, why do men and women je&s;t and dally in the great matters of e|ternity? Little do people think, what they &s;light, when they are &s;eldom and formal in &s;ecret duties, and when they neglect that great duty of meditation, which I have through rich mercy, found &s;o &s;weet and refre&s;hing: O, what do Chri&s;tians mean, that they keep at &s;uch a di&s;tance from Chri&s;t? Did they but know the thou&s;andth part of that &s;weetne&s;s that is in him, they could not choo&s;e but follow him hard; they would run and not weary, and walk and not be faint.</P>
<P>He could &s;en&s;ibly and experimentally commend the ways of God to the poor unexperienced world, and &s;ay, <HI>His ways are plea&s;antne&s;s;</HI> and ju&s;tifie wi&s;|dom
<PB N="78" REF="78">and &s;ay, <HI>her paths were peace.</HI> He could take off tho&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, which the devil, and the athe|i&s;tical frantick &s;ots, do ca&s;t upon godline&s;s in the power of it. Here is one that could challenge all the athei&s;ts in the world to di&s;pute; here is one could bring &s;en&s;ible demon&s;trations to prove a deity, and the reality and excellency of invi&s;ibles; which the&s;e ignorant fools and mad men, make the &s;ubject of their &s;corn: here is one that would not change de|lights with the greate&s;t Epicures living, and vie plea|&s;ure with all the &s;en&s;ual rich gallants of the world. Which of them all could in the mid&s;t of their jollity &s;ay. <HI>This is the plea&s;ure, that &s;hall la&s;t for ever?</HI> Which of them can &s;ay among their cups and whores, <HI>I can now look death in the face,</HI> and, <HI>this very mo|ment I can be content,</HI> yea glad, <HI>to leave the&s;e delights, as knowing, I &s;hall enjoy better.</HI> And this he could do, when he fared deliciou&s;ly in &s;pritual banquets every day: He could, upon better rea&s;on than he did, &s;ay, <HI>Soul thou ha&s;t goods laid up for many years;</HI> He knew full well, that what he did here enjoy, was but a little to what he &s;hould have &s;hortly. <HI>In his pre&s;ence there is fulne&s;s of joy; at his right hand there are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI> Where is the Bel&s;hazzar, that would not quake in the mid&s;t of his cups, whil&s;t he is quaffing and carouzing in bowls of the riche&s;t wine, if he &s;hould &s;ee a hand upon the wall writing bitter things again&s;t him, telling him that his joys are at an end, and that this night his &s;oul mu&s;t be re|quired of him; that now, he mu&s;t come away and give an account of all his ungodly plea&s;ures, before the mighty God. Where is the &s;inner, that could be contented to hear the Lord roaring out of Zion, whil&s;t be is roaring in the tavern? Which of them would be glad to hear the trumpet &s;ound, and to hear that voice, <HI>Ari&s;e you dead and come to judgment?</HI> Which of them would rejoice to &s;ee the mountains quaking, the elements melting with fervent heat, and the earth con&s;umed with flames; and the Lord
<PB N="79" REF="79">Chri&s;t whom they de&s;pi&s;ed, coming in the clouds with millions of his &s;aints and angels, to be avenged upon tho&s;e that know not God and obeyed not his go&s;pel. Is not that a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, when a man can lift up his head with joy, when others tremble with fear, and &s;ink with &s;orrow? And this was the con|dition of this holy young man. In the mid&s;t of all worldly conforts he longed for death: and the thought of the day of judgment, made all his enjoy|ment &s;weeter. O, how did he long for the coming of Chri&s;t! Whil&s;t &s;ome have been di&s;cour&s;ing by him of that great and terrible dya of the Lord, he would &s;mile, and humbly expre&s;s his delight in the forethought of that approaching hour.</P>
<P>I remember, once there was a great talk that one had foretold that doom&s;day &s;hould be upon &s;uch a day: although he blamed their daring folly, that would pretend to know that which was hid from the angels them&s;elves, and that the devil could not ac|quaint them with; yet granting their &s;uppo&s;ition to be true, what then &s;aid he? What, if the day of judgment were come, as it will mo&s;t certainly come &s;hortly! If I were &s;ure, the dya of judgment were to begin within a hour, I &s;hould be glad with all my heart. If at this very in&s;tant, I &s;hould hear &s;uch thunderings, and &s;ee &s;uch lightnings, as I&s;rael did at Mount Sinai; I am per&s;waded, my very heart would leap for joy But this I am confident of, through infinite mercy, that the very meditation of that day hath even ravi&s;hed my &s;oul, and the thought of the certainty and nearne&s;s of it, is more refre&s;hing to me than the comforts of the whole world. Surely, no|thing can more revice my &s;pirits than to behold the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, the joy, life and beauty of my &s;oul. Would it not more rejoice me than Jo&s;eph's waggons did old Jacob? I lately dreamed that the day of judgment was come: methought, I heard terrible cracks of thunder, and &s;aw dreadful lightnings; the foundation of the earth did &s;hake, and the heavens
<PB N="80" REF="80">were rolled together as a garment: yea, all things vi&s;ible were in a flame; methought I &s;aw the graves opened, and the earth and &s;ea giving up their dead; methought, I &s;aw millions of angels, and Chri&s;t com|ing in the clouds. Methought, I beheld the ancient of days &s;itting upon his throne, and all other thrones ca&s;t down: methought, I beheld him who&s;e gar|ments were white as &s;now, and the hair of his head like pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire; a fiery &s;tream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from him; thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands mini&s;tred unto him; and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;tood before him; and the judgment was &s;et and the books were opened. O, but with what an exta&s;ie of joy was I &s;urprized! Methought, it was the mo&s;t heart-rai&s;ing, and &s;oul-ravi&s;hing &s;ight, that ever my eyes beheld: and then I cried out. <HI>I have waited for thy &s;alvation, O God;</HI> and &s;o I mounted into the air, to meet my Lord in the clouds.</P>
<P>This I record, only to &s;hew, how far he was from being daunted at the thoughts of death or judgment: and to let other Chri&s;tians know, what is attainable in ths life; and what folly it is, for us to take up with &s;o little, when our Lord is plea&s;ed to make &s;uch noble provi&s;ions for us, and by a wi&s;e and diligent improvement of tho&s;e means which God hath offer|ed us, we may have an entrance admini&s;tred to us abundantly into the everla&s;ing kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Oh how confortable, how honourable, and how profitable is this e&s;tate! The&s;e are your men that quit them&s;elves like Chri&s;tians. This is true gallantry, noble manhood, real valour! This was the conditi|on of Mr. Janeway for about three years before he died. I will not deny but that he had &s;ome clouds; but he u&s;ually walked in a &s;weet, even, humble &s;e|renity of &s;pirit, and his refre&s;hing joys were more con&s;iderable than his de&s;pondings; and though he daily que&s;tioned many actions, yet did not que&s;tion
<PB N="81" REF="81">his &s;tate, but had his heart fixed upon that rock that neither waves nor winds could &s;hake. His &s;en&s;es were &s;till &s;o &s;piritually exerci&s;ed, as that he could look up to heaven as his country and inheritance, and to God as his Father, and to Chri&s;t as his Re|deemer; and (that which is &s;carce to be heard of) he counted it the highe&s;t act of patience to be willing to live, and a very great pitch of &s;elf-denial to be contented to be in this world, and to dwell on this &s;ide a full and eternal enjoyment of that royal glo|rious One whom his &s;oul was &s;o much in love with. In a word, he had the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ires to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t that I ever &s;aw, read, or heard of, &s;ince the apo&s;tles times.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> His la&s;t Sickne&s;s and Death.</HEAD>
<P>AND now the time draws nigh, wherein his longings &s;hall be &s;atisfied; he is called to his la&s;t work; and truly his deportment in it, was ho|nourable; his carriage &s;o eminently gracious, &s;o meek, patient, fruitful, joyful, and thinkful, that it made all his friends &s;tand and wonder, as being abundant|ly above their experience and reading: and tho&s;e Chri&s;tians that &s;aw him, could not but admire God in him, and look upon him as one of the mo&s;t &s;in|gular in&s;tances of rich grace, and even ble&s;s God that their eyes ever &s;aw, or their ears ever heard &s;uch things, and had &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration of the reality of invi&s;ibles.</P>
<P><HI>He falls into a deep Con&s;umptions.</HI></P>
<P>His body is now &s;haken again, and he falls into a deep con&s;umption; but, this me&s;&s;enger of God did not in the lea&s;t damp him. Spitting of blood,
<PB N="82" REF="82">was no gha&s;tly thing to one that had his eye upon the blood of Je&s;us; faint &s;weats did not daunt him that had always &s;uch reviving cordials at hand. It's matter of joy to him, that he was now in &s;ome hopes of having his earne&s;t de&s;ires &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>After he had been a while &s;ick, a &s;udden dim|ne&s;s &s;eized upon his eyes; by and by his &s;ight quite failed; and there was &s;uch a vi&s;ible alteration in him, that he and others judged the&s;e things to be the &s;umptoms of death approaching. But when he was thus taken, he was not in the lea&s;t &s;urprized; but was lifted up with joy to thin, what a life he was going to, looing upon death it&s;elf as one of his Father's &s;ervants, and his friend that was &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to conduct him &s;afely to his glorious pa|lace.</P>
<P>When he felt his body ready to faint, he called to his mother and &s;aid, <Q>Dear mother I am dying, but I be&s;eech you not to be troubled; for, I am through mercy, quite above the fears of death, it's no great matter, I have nothing troubles me but the apprehen&s;ions of your grief. I am going to him whom I love above life?</Q></P>
<P>But it plea&s;ed the Lord to rai&s;e him again a little out of this fainting fit, for his Ma&s;ter had yet more work for him to do before he mu&s;t receive his wa|ges. Although his outwad man decayed apace, yet he is renewed in the inward man day by day: his graces were never more active, and his experi|ences were never greater. When one would have thought, he &s;hould have been taken up with his di&s;temper, and that it had been enough for him to grapple with his pains, then he quite forgets his weakne&s;s; and is &s;o &s;wallowed up of the life to come, that he had &s;carce lei&s;ure to think of his &s;ick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>For &s;everal weeks together, I never heard the lea&s;t word that &s;avoured of any complaint or wea|rine&s;s under the hand of God; except, his eager de|&s;ire
<PB N="83" REF="83">to be with Chri&s;t, be counted complaining, and his ha&s;te to be in heaven be called impatience. Now's the time when one might have &s;een heaven and the glory of another world realized to &s;en&s;e. His faith grew exceedingly and his love was proportionable, and his joys were equal to both.</P>
<P>O the rare attainments! The high and divine ex|pre&s;&s;ions, that dropped from his mouth! I have not words to expre&s;s what a &s;trange, triumphant, angelical frame he was in, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time together. It was a very heaven upon earth, to &s;ee and hear a man admiring God at &s;uch a rate, as I never heard any, nor ever expect to hear or &s;ee more, till I come to heaven. Tho&s;e that did not &s;ee cannot well conceive what a &s;weet frame he was in, for at lea&s;t &s;ix weeks before he died. His &s;oul was almo&s;t always filled with tho&s;e joys un&s;peakable and full of glory. How oft would he cry out; <HI>O, that I could but let you know what I feel now! O, that I could &s;how you what I &s;ee, that I could expre&s;s the thou&s;andth part of that &s;weetne&s;s that I now find in Chri&s;t! You would all then think it well worth the while to make it your bu&s;ine&s;s to be religious.</HI> O my dear friends, we little think what a Chri&s;t is worth upon a death bed. I would not for a world, nay for millions of worlds, be now without a Chri&s;t and a pardon. I would not for a world be to live any long|er: the very thoughts of a po&s;&s;iblity of recovery, makes me tremble.</P>
<P>When one came to vi&s;it him, and told him, that he hoped it might plea&s;e God to rai&s;e him again and and that he had &s;een many a weaker man re&s;tored to health, and that lived many a good year after: <HI>And do you think to plea&s;e me</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e as this?</HI> No friend, you are much mi&s;taken in me, if you think that the thoughts of life, and health, and the world, are plea&s;ing to me. The world hath quite lo&s;t its excellency in my judgment. O how poor and contemptible a thing is it in all its glory, com|pared
<PB N="84" REF="84">with the glory of that invi&s;ible world which I now live in the &s;ight of! And as for life, Chri&s;t is my life health and &s;trength; and I know, I &s;hall have another kind of life, when I leave this I tell you it would incomparably more plea&s;e me, if you &s;hould &s;ay to me, [You are no man of this world; you cannot po&s;&s;ibly hold out long; before to morrow you will be in eternity.] I tell you I do &s;o long to be with Chri&s;t, that I could be contented to be cut in pieces, and to be put to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments, &s;o I might but die, and be with Chri&s;t. O, how &s;weet is Je&s;us! <HI>Come, Lord Je&s;us come quickly.</HI> Death, do thy wor&s;t! Death hath lo&s;t his terriblene&s;s. Death, it is nothing. I &s;ay, death is nothing (through grace) to me. I can as ea&s;ily die as &s;hut my eyes, or turn my head and &s;leep: <HI>I long to be with Chri&s;t; I long to die;</HI> that was &s;till his note.</P>
<P>His mother and brethren &s;tanding by him he &s;aid; <Q>Dear mother, I be&s;eech you, as earne&s;tly as ever I de&s;ired anything of you in my life, that you would cheerfully give me up to Chri&s;t; I be&s;eech you, do not hinder me now I am going to re&s;t and glory. I am afraid of your prayers, le&s;t they pull: one way and mine another.</Q></P>
<P>And then turning to his brethren he &s;pake thus to them, <Q>I charge you all, do not pray for my life a|ny more: you do me wrong, if you do! O that glory, the un&s;peakable glory that I behold My heart is full, my heart is full Chri&s;t &s;miles, and I cannot choo&s;e but &s;mile: can you find in your heart, to &s;top me who am now going to the com|pleate and eternal enjoyment of Chri&s;t? Would you keep me from my crown? The arms of my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour are open to embrace me; the angels &s;tand ready to carry my &s;oul in his bo&s;om. O, did you but &s;ee what I &s;ee; you would all cry out with me, how long, dear Lord, come Lord Je&s;us come
<PB N="85" REF="85">quickly! O why are his chariot-wheels &s;o long a coming!</Q></P>
<P>And all this while he lay like a triumphing con|queror, &s;miling and rejoicing in &s;pirit.</P>
<P>There was never a day towards his end but (as weak as he was) he did &s;ome &s;pecial piece of &s;ervice in, for his great ma&s;ter. Yea, almo&s;t every hour did produce fre&s;h wonders</P>
<P>A reverend, judicious and holy mini&s;ter came of|ten to vi&s;it him, and di&s;cour&s;ed with him of the ex|cellency of Chri&s;t, and the glory of the invi&s;ible world. Sir, &s;aid he, <HI>I feel &s;omething of it, my heart is as full as it can hold in this lower &s;tate; I can hold no more here. O that I could but let you know what I feel!</HI></P>
<P>This holy mini&s;ter praying with him his &s;oul was ravi&s;hed with the abundant incomes of light, life, and love; &s;o that he could &s;carce bear it, nor the thought of &s;taying any longer in the world, but long|ed to be in &s;uch a condition, wherein he &s;hould yet have more grace and more comfort, and be better able to bear that weight of glory; &s;ome manife&s;tati|ons whereof did even almo&s;t &s;ink his weak body, and had he not been &s;u&s;tained by a great power, his very joys would have overwhelmed him; and whil&s;t he was in the&s;e exta&s;ies of joy and love, he was wont to cry out.</P>
<P><Q>Who am I Lord, who am I, that thou &s;hould&s;t be mindful of! Why me Lord; why me, and pa&s;s by thou&s;ands and look upon &s;uch a wretch as me. O, what &s;hall I &s;ay, unto thee, O thou pre&s;erver of men? O, why me Lord, why me? O ble&s;&s;ed, and for ever ble&s;&s;ed, be free grace! How is it, Lord, that thou &s;hould&s;t manife&s;t thy&s;elf unto me, and not unto others, even &s;o father, becau&s;e it &s;eemeth good in thy eyes, Thou wilt have mercy becau&s;e thou wilt have mercy. And if thou wilt look upon &s;uch a poor worm who can hinder! Who would not love thee! O ble&s;&s;ed father! O how &s;weet and gracious ha&s;t thou been unto me? O,
<PB N="86" REF="86">that he &s;hould have me in his thoughts of love, be|fore the foundations of the world.</Q></P>
<P>And thus he went on, admiring and adoring of God, in a more high and heavenly manner than I can clothe with words. Suppo&s;e what you can on this &s;ide heaven; and I am per&s;uaded you might have &s;een it in him. He was wonderfully taken with the goodne&s;s of God to him in &s;ending that aged ex|perienced mini&s;ter to help him in his la&s;t great work upon earth. <Q>Who am I, &s;aid he, that God &s;hould to me a me&s;&s;enger one among a thou&s;and (meaning that mini&s;ter who had been praying with him tears of joy.)</Q></P>
<P>Though he was towards his end, mo&s;t commonly in a triumphant joyful frame; yet, &s;ometimes, e|ven then he had &s;ome &s;mall intermi&s;&s;ions, in which he would cry out, <HI>Hold out faith and patience; yet a little while, and your work is done.</HI> And when he found not his heart wound up to the highe&s;t pitch of unthankfulne&s;s, admiration and love; he would with great &s;orrow bemoan him&s;elf, and cry out in this language.</P>
<P><Q>And what's the matter now, O my &s;oul, what wilt thou, can&s;t thou thus unworthily &s;light this admirable and a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cen&s;ion of God to thee? Seems it a &s;mall matter, that the great Je|hovah &s;hould deal thus familiarly with his worm; and wilt thou pa&s;s this over, as a common mercy? What meane&s;t thou, O my &s;oul, that thou do&s;t not con&s;tantly adore and prai&s;e this rare, &s;trong, and un&s;peakable love! Is it true, O my &s;oul, doth God deal familiarly with man, and are an humble, zea|lous, and con&s;tant love, prai&s;e, and &s;ervice too good for God? Why art thou, O my &s;oul, &s;wal|lowed up every moment with this free unparalell'd everla&s;ting love.</Q></P>
<P>And then he breaks out again into another trium|phing exta&s;y of prai&s;e and joy; and expre&s;&s;ed a
<PB N="87" REF="87">little of that which was unexpre&s;&s;ible in &s;ome &s;uch words as the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>Stand a&s;toni&s;hed ye heavens, and wonder O ye angels at this infinite grace! Was ever any under heaven more beholding to free grace than I? Doth God u&s;e to do thus, with his creatures? Admire him for ever and ever, O ye redeemed ones! O tho&s;e joys, the ta&s;te of which I have! Tho&s;e ever|la&s;ting joys, which are at his right hand for ever more! Eternity, Eternity it &s;elf, is too &s;hort to prai&s;e this God in. O ble&s;s the Lord with me come let us &s;hout for joy and boa&s;t in the God of our &s;alvation. O, help me to prai&s;e the Lord; for, his mercy endureth for ever!</Q></P>
<P>One of his brethren (that had formerly been wrought upon by his holy exhortations and example) praying with him, and &s;eeing of him, (as he appre|hended) near his di&s;&s;olution, de&s;ired, that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to continue tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing and &s;oul &s;upporting comforts to the la&s;t moment of his breath, and that he might go from one heaven to another, from grace and joy imperfect, to perfect grace and glory; and when his work was done here, give him, if it were his will, the mo&s;t ea&s;y and trium|phant pa&s;&s;age to re&s;t; and that he might have an a|bundant entrance admini&s;tred into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>At the end of the duty he bur&s;t out into a won|derful pa&s;&s;ion of joy. (Sure that was joy un&s;peak|able and full of glory!) O what an amen did he &s;peak, amen, amen, amen, hallelujah.</P>
<P>It would have made any Chri&s;tians heart to leap, to have &s;een and heard, what &s;ome &s;aw and heard, at that time; and I que&s;tion not, but that it will &s;omewhat effect them to hear and read it; though it be &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak the half of what was ad|mirable in him: for, it being &s;o much beyond pre&s;i|dent, it did even a&s;toni&s;h and amaze tho&s;e of us that
<PB N="88" REF="88">were about him, that our relation mu&s;t fall hugely &s;hort of what was real.</P>
<P>I verily believe that it exceeds the highe&s;t rheto|rick, to &s;et out to the life, what this heavenly crea|ture did then deliver. I &s;ay again, I want words to &s;peak, and &s;o did he; for, he &s;aw things unutter|able: But yet, &s;o much he &s;pake as ju&s;tly drew the admiration of all that &s;aw him; and I heard an old experienced Chri&s;tian and mini&s;ter &s;ay it again and again, That he never &s;aw, nor read, nor heard the like: neither could we expect to &s;ee the glories of heaven more demon&s;trated to &s;en&s;e, in this world. He talked as if he had been in the third heavens, and broke out into &s;uch words as the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>O, He is come! He is come! O how &s;weet! How glorious is the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! How &s;hall I do to &s;peak the thou&s;andth part of his prai&s;es! O for words, to &s;et out a little of that excellency! But it is unexpre&s;&s;ible! O how excellent, glorious and lovely is the precious Je&s;us! He is &s;weet, He is al|together lovely! And now I am &s;ick of love, he hath ravi&s;hed my &s;oul with his beauty! I &s;hall die &s;ick of love.</Q></P>
<P><Q>O my friends &s;tand by and wonder, come look upon a dying man, and wonder; I cannot my&s;elf but &s;tand and wonder; Was there ever a greater kindne&s;s, was there ever &s;en&s;ibler manife&s;tations of rich grace! O, why me, Lord, why me! Sure this is a-kin to heaven, and if I were never to enjoy any more than this; it were well worth all the tor|ments that men and devils could invent, to come thorow even hell to &s;uch tran&s;cendent joys as the&s;e. If this be dying, dying is &s;weet: let no true Chri&s;|tian ever be afraid of dying. O death is &s;weet to me. This bed is &s;oft. Chri&s;t's arms and ki&s;&s;es, his &s;miles and vi&s;its, &s;ure they would turn hell in|to heaven. O that you did but &s;ee and feel what I do! Come and behold a dying man more chearful than you ever &s;aw any healthful man in the mid&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="89">of his &s;weete&s;t enjoyments? O &s;irs, worldly plea|&s;ures are pitiful poor &s;orry things, compared with one glimp&s;e of this glory, which &s;hines in &s;o &s;trong|ly into my &s;oul! O why &s;hould any of you be &s;o &s;ad, when I am &s;o glad? This is the hour that I have waited for!</Q></P>
<P>About eight and forty hours before his death his eyes were dim and his &s;ight much failed; his jaws &s;hook and trembled, and his feet were cold, and all the &s;ymptoms of death were upon him, and his ex|treme parts were already almo&s;t dead and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and yet, even then, his joys were (if po&s;&s;ible) great|er &s;till: He had &s;o many fits of joy un&s;peakable, that he &s;eemed to be in one continued act of &s;eraph|ick love, and prai&s;e. He &s;pake like one that was ju&s;t entering into the gates of the new Jeru&s;alem: the greate&s;t part of him was now in heaven; not a word dropped from his mouth but it breathed Chri&s;t and heaven O what encouragements did he give to them who did &s;tand by, to follow hard after God, and to follow Chri&s;t in a humble, believing, zealous cour&s;e of life, and adding one degree of grace to an|other, and u&s;ing all diligence to make their calling and election &s;ure; and that then, they al&s;o &s;hould have a glorious pa&s;&s;age into a ble&s;&s;ed eternity.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t of his work was prai&s;e, a hundred times admiring of the bottomle&s;s love of God to him. O why me, Lord, why me! And then he would give in&s;tructions to them that came to &s;ee him. He was &s;carce ever &s;ilent, becau&s;e the love of Chri&s;t and &s;ouls did con&s;train him. There was &s;o much work done for Chri&s;t in his la&s;t ours, that I am ready to think, he did as much in an hour as &s;ome do in a year.</P>
<P>Every particular per&s;on had a faithful affectionate warning. And that good mini&s;ter, that was &s;o much with him, u&s;ed this as an argument to per&s;wade him to be willing to live a little longer, and to be patient to tarry God's lei&s;ure; &s;ure God hath &s;ome thing for thee to do that is yet undone; &s;ome word
<PB N="90" REF="90">of exhortation to &s;ome poor &s;oul, that you have forgot.</P>
<P>The truth of it is, he was &s;o filled with the love of Chri&s;t, that he could &s;carce bear ab&s;ence from him a moment. He knew that he &s;hould be capa|ble of bearing of greater glory above, than he could here. It was the judgment of &s;ome that were with him that his heart was not only habitually but actually &s;et on God all the day long; and nothing of human frail|ty, that could be thought a &s;in, did appear for &s;ome|time: except it were his pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to die, and difficulty to bring him&s;elf to be willing to &s;tay be|low heaven.</P>
<P>He was wont every evening to take his leave of his friends, hoping not to &s;ee them, till the morning of the re&s;urrection; and he de&s;ired that they would be &s;ure, to make &s;ure of a comfortable meeting at our fathers hou&s;e, in that other world.</P>
<P>I cannot relate the twentieth part of that which de&s;erved to be written in letters of gold. And one that was one of the weake&s;t, &s;aid, that he did verily believe, that If we had been exact in our taking his &s;entences, and ob&s;erving his daily experiences, he could not imagine, a book could be publi&s;hed of greater u&s;e to the world, next the bible it&s;elf.</P>
<P>One rare pa&s;&s;age I can't omit, which was this, that when mini&s;ters or Chri&s;tians came to him, he would beg of them to &s;pend all the time that they had with him in prai&s;e. <Q>O help me to prai&s;e God, I have now nothing el&s;e to do from this time to e|ternity, but to prai&s;e and love God. I have what my &s;oul de&s;ires upon earth,</Q> I cannot tell what to pray for but what I have graciou&s;ly given in. The wants that are capable of &s;upplying in this world, are &s;upplied. I want but one thing, and that is, a &s;peedy lift to heaven. I expect no more here, I can't de&s;ire more, I can't hear more. O prai&s;e, prai&s;e, prai&s;e that infinite boundle&s;s love that hath, to a wonder, looked upon my &s;oul, and done more for
<PB N="91" REF="91">me than thou&s;ands of his dear children. O ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and all that is within me ble&s;s his holy name. <Q>O help me, O my friends, to prai&s;e and admire him that hath done &s;uch a&s;ton|i&s;hing wonders for my &s;oul; he hath pardoned all my &s;ins, he hath filled me with his goodne&s;s; he hath given me grace and glory, and no good thing hath he withheld from me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Come help me with prai&s;es, all's too little: come, help me, O ye glorious and mighty angels, who are &s;o well &s;killed in this heavenly work of prai&s;e. Prai&s;e him, all ye creatures upon the earth, let e|very thing that hath being, help me to prai&s;e him. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah: Prai&s;e is now my work, and I &s;hall be engaged in this &s;weet em|ployment for ever. Bring the bible, turn to Da|vids P&s;alms, and let us &s;ing a P&s;alm of prai&s;e; Come let us lift up our voice in the prai&s;e of the mo&s;t high, I will &s;ing with you as long as my breath doth la&s;t; and when I have done, I &s;hall do it better.</Q></P>
<P>And then turning to &s;ome of his friends that were weeping, he de&s;ired them rather to rejoice than weep upon his account. It may ju&s;tly &s;eem a won|der, how he could &s;peak &s;o much as he did, when he was &s;o weak; but the joy of the Lord did &s;trength|en him.</P>
<P>In his &s;ickne&s;s, the &s;criptures that he took much de|light in, were the fourteenth, fifteenth, &s;ixteenth, and &s;eventeenth of John. The fifty fourth of I&s;aiah was very refre&s;hing al&s;o to him; he would repeat that word <HI>[with everla&s;ting mercies will I gather]</HI> with abundance of joy</P>
<P>He recommended the &s;tudy of the promi&s;es to be|lievers and de&s;ired that they would be &s;ure to make good their claim to them, and then they might come to the wells of con&s;olation, and drink thereof, their fill.</P>
<P>According to his de&s;ire mo&s;t of the time that was &s;pent with him, was &s;pent in prai&s;e; and he would
<PB N="92" REF="92">&s;till be calling out, 'More prai&s;e &s;till. O, help me <Q>to prai&s;e him: I have now nothing el&s;e to do; I have done with prayer, and all other ordinances; I have almo&s;t done conver&s;ing with mortals. I &s;hall pre&s;ently be beholding Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that died for me, and loved me, and wa&s;hed me in his blood.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hall before a few hours are over, be in eterni|ty &s;inging the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, and the &s;ong of the Lamb. I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;tand upon Mount Zion, with an inumerable company of angels, and the &s;pirit of the ju&s;t made perfect, and Je&s;us the medi|ator of the new covenant, I &s;hall hear the voice of much people, and be one among&s;t them, which &s;hall &s;ay Hallelujah, &s;alvation, glory, honour, and power unto the Lord our God; and again, we &s;hall &s;ay Hallelujah. And yet a very little while and I &s;hall &s;ing unto the Lamb a &s;ong of prai&s;e, &s;aying, worthy art thou to receive prai&s;e who wert &s;lain, and redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and na|tion, and ha&s;t made us unto our God, kings and prie&s;ts, and we &s;hall reign with thee for ever and ever</Q></P>
<P><Q>Methinks I &s;tand as it were, with one foot in heaven, and the other upon earth; methinks, I hear the melody of heaven, and by faith, I &s;ee the angels waiting to carry my &s;oul to the bo&s;om of Je|&s;us, and I &s;hall be for ever with the Lord in glory.</Q> And who can choo&s;e but rejoice in all this.</P>
<P>In &s;everal times, he &s;pake in this language, and repeated many of the&s;e words often, over, and o|ver again, with far greater affection, than can be well worded. And I &s;olemnly profe&s;s, that what is here written, is no hyperbole, and that the twenti|eth part of what was ob&s;ervable in him is not record|ed, and though we cannot word it exactly as he did, yet you have the &s;ub&s;tance, and many things in his own words with little or no variation.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="93">The day before his death he looked &s;ome what earne&s;tly upon his brother James, who &s;tood by him very &s;ad; of whom he judged that he was putting up &s;ome ejaculations to God upon his account, <Q>I thank thee dear brother for thy love, &s;aid he, thou art now praying for me, and I know thou love&s;t me dearly: but Chri&s;t loveth me ten thou&s;and times more than thou do&s;t; come and ki&s;s me, dear brother before I die; and &s;o with his cold dying lips, he ki&s;sed him, and &s;aid, I &s;hall go before, and I hope thou &s;halt follow after to glory.</Q></P>
<P>Though he was almo&s;t always prai&s;ing God, and exhort|ing them that were about him to mind their everla&s;ting con|cerns, and &s;ecure an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t; and though he &s;lept but very little for &s;ome nights; yet he was not in the le&s;t impaired in intellectuals, but his actions were all decent, and becoming a man, and his di&s;cour&s;e to a &s;piritual under&s;tand|ing, highly rational, &s;olid, divine. And &s;o he continued to the la&s;t minute of his breath.</P>
<P>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew hours before his death he called all his relations, and brethren together, that he might give them one &s;olemn warning more; and ble&s;s them, and pray for them, as his breath and &s;trength would give him leave. Which he did with abundance of authority, affection and &s;pirituality, which take briefly, as it follows.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he thanked his dear mother, for her tender love to him, and de&s;ired that &s;he might be in travel to &s;ee Chri&s;tform|ed in the &s;ouls of the re&s;t of her children, and &s;ee of the tra|vel of her &s;ouls, and meet them with joy in that great day.</P>
<P>Then, He charged all his brethren and &s;i&s;ters in general, as they would an&s;wer it before God, that they &s;hould carry it dutiful to their dear mother. As for his elde&s;t brother William, (at who&s;e hou&s;e he lay &s;ick) his prayer was, that he might be &s;wallowed up of Chri&s;t, and love to &s;ouls; and be more and more examplary in his life, and &s;ucce&s;sful in his mini&s;try, and fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy.</P>
<P>His next brothers name was Andrew, a citizen of London, who was with him and &s;aw him in this triumphing &s;tate; but (his nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s calling him away) he could not then be by; yet, he was not forgot, but he was thus ble&s;&s;ed <Q>The God of heaven remember my poor brother at London The Lord make him truly rich in giving him the pearl of great price, and make him a fellow citizen with the &s;aints and of the hou&s;e-hold of God; the Lord deliver him, from the &s;ins of that city, may the world be kept out of his heart and Chri&s;t dwell there. O that he may be as his name is a&s;trong man, and that I may meet him with joy.</Q></P>
<P>Then he called his next brother, who&s;e name was James (whom he hoped God bad made him a &s;piritual father to) whom he thus adre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, brother James, <Q>I hope the
<PB N="94" REF="94">Lord hath given thee a goodly heritage the lines are fallen to thee in plea&s;ant placea; the Lord is thy portion. I hope the Lord hath &s;hewed thee the worth of a Chri&s;t.</Q> Hold on dear brother; Chri&s;t, heaven and glory, are worth &s;triving for; the Lord give thee more abundance of his grace.</P>
<P>Then, his next brother Abraham was called; to whom he &s;pake to this purpo&s;e, <Q>The ble&s;&s;ing of the God of Abraham re&s;t upon thee, the Lord make thee a Father of many &s;pi|ritual children.</Q></P>
<P>His fifth brother, was Jo&s;eph, whom he ble&s;&s;ed in this manner, <Q>Let him ble&s;s thee, O Jo&s;eph, that ble&s;&s;ed him that was &s;eparated from his brethren. O that his everla&s;t arms may take hold on thee! It is enough, if yet thou maye&s;t live in his &s;ight. My heart hath been working to|wards thee, poor Jo&s;eph; and I am not without hopes, that the arm of the almighty will embrace thee. The God of thy father ble&s;s thee with the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven above</Q></P>
<P>The next, was his &s;i&s;ter Mary, to whom he &s;poke thus, <Q>Poor &s;i&s;ter Mary, thy body is weak and thy days will be filled with bitterne&s;s; thy name is Marah, the Lord &s;weet|en all with his grace and peace, and give thee health in thy &s;oul. Be patient, make &s;ure of Chri&s;t, and all is well.</Q></P>
<P>Then, his other &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name was Sarah, was called; whom he thus ble&s;&s;ed, &s;i&s;ter Sarah, <Q>Thy body is &s;trong and healthful; O that thy &s;oul may be &s;o too! The Lord make thee fir&s;t a wi&s;e virgin, and then a mother in I&s;rael; a pattern of mode&s;ty, humility, and holine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The another brother, Jacob was called; whom he ble&s;&s;|ed after this manner, <Q>The Lord make thee indeed, in whom there is no guile! O that thou maye&s;t learn to wre&s;tle with God, and laike a prince, maye&s;t prevail, and not go with|out the ble&s;&s;ing!</Q></P>
<P>Then he prayed for his younge&s;t brother Benjamin, who was then but an infant; <Q>Poor little Benjamin, O that the father of the fatherle&s;s, would take care of thee poor child, that thou, who never &s;awe&s;t thy father upon earth maye&s;t &s;ee him with joy in heaven; the Lord be thy father, and portion; maye&s;t thou prove the &s;on of thy mothers right hand, and the joy of her age!</Q></P>
<P><Q>O that none of us all, may be found among&s;t the uncon|verted in the day of judgment! O that every one of us may appear (with our honoured father, and dear mother) before Chri&s;t with joy that they may &s;ay, Lord here are we, and the children which thou ha&s;t graciou&s;lygiven us. O that we may live to God here, and live with him hereafter.</Q></P>
<P>And now, my dear mother, brethren, and &s;i&s;ters, fare|well; I leave you for a while, and I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">And now dear Lord, my work is done, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have fought the good fight; and henceforth there remaineth for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s! Now come dear Lord Je&s;us come quickly.</P>
<P>Then that godly mini&s;ter came to give him his la&s;t vi&s;it, and to do the office of an inferiour angel, to help to con|vey this ble&s;&s;ed &s;oul to glory who was now even upon mount Pi&s;gah, and had a full &s;ight of that goodly land at a little di&s;tance. When this mini&s;ter &s;pake to him, his heart was in a mighty flame of love and joy, which drew tears of joy from that precious mini&s;ter, being almo&s;t amazed to hear a man juft a dying, talk ju&s;t as if he had been with Je&s;us, and came from the immediate pre&s;ence of God; O the &s;miles that were then in his face, and the un&s;peakable joy that was in his heart; one might have read grace, and glory, in &s;uch a mans countenance. O the prai&s;e, the triumphant prai&s;es, that he put up! And every one mu&s;t &s;peak prai&s;e about him or el&s;e they make &s;ome jar in his harmony.</P>
<P>And indeed mo&s;t did, as well as they could help him in prai&s;e. So that I never heard, nor knew more prai&s;es given to God in one room than in this chamber.</P>
<P>A little before he died, in the prayer, or rather prai&s;es, he was &s;o wrapt up with admiration and joy, that he could &s;carce forbear &s;houting for joy. In the conclu&s;ion of the duty, with abundance of faith, and fervency, he &s;aid aloud amen, amen!</P>
<P>And now his de&s;ires &s;hall &s;oon be &s;atisfied. He &s;eeth death coming apace to do his office, his jaws are loo&s;ened more and more, and quiver greatly; his hands and feet are as cold as clay, and a cold &s;weet is upon him: but, O how glad was he when he felt his Spirit ju&s;t a going! Never was death more welcome to any mortal, I think. Tho' the pangs of death were &s;trong; yet that far more exceeding and eter|nal weight of glory, made him endure tho&s;e bitter pains, with much patience and courage. In the extremity of his pains he de&s;ired his elde&s;t brother to lay him a little lower, and to take away one pillow from him, that he might die with the more ea&s;e; his brother replied that he dur&s;t not for a world, do any thing that might ha&s;ten his death for a moment. Then he was well &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and did &s;weetly re&s;ign him&s;elf un wholly to God's di&s;po'al; and after a few minutes, with a &s;udden motion gathering up all his &s;trength, he gave him|&s;elt a little turn on one &s;ide; and in the twinkling of an eye departed to the Lord, &s;leeping in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And now ble&s;&s;ed &s;oul, thy longings are &s;atisfied, and thou &s;ee&s;t and feele&s;t a thou&s;and times more than thou did&s;t upon earth, and yet thou can&s;t bear it with delight, thou art now welcomed to thy fathers hou&s;e by Chri&s;t, the beloved of thy &s;oul; now thou ha&s;t heard him &s;ay, come, thou ble&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="96" REF="96">my father, and, well done good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joys of thy Lord, and wear that crown which was prepared for thee, before the foundation of the world</P>
<P>O that all the relations which thou ha&s;t left behind thee, may live thy life, and die thy death, and five with Chri&s;t, and thee, for ever and ever amen, amen.</P>
<P>He died June 1657, aged 23-24. and was buried in Kel&s;hal-Church, in Hartford&s;hire.</P>
