<HEAD>REMARKS ON A PRINTED PAPER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received from a worthy Friend in the country, for whom I have the greate&s;t e&s;teem, a printed paper, which had been &s;ent him by Dr. Kennicott, intituled, <Q>A Cata|logue of the <HI>Sacred Ve&s;&s;els</HI> re&s;tored by <HI>Cyrus;</HI> and of the <HI>Chief Jews</HI> who re|turned at fir&s;t from the Captivity, to|gether with the Names of the return|ing <HI>Families,</HI> and the <HI>Number</HI> of the Per&s;ons at that Time in each Family; di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;hew
<PB N="4" REF="3">mo&s;t clearly the great corruption of <HI>Proper Names</HI> and <HI>Numbers</HI> in the pre|&s;ent Text of the Old-Te&s;tament;</Q> and being de&s;ired to return the &s;aid paper when I had peru&s;ed it, I thought I could not hand&s;omely do &s;o without &s;ending my opinion of it at the &s;ame time. The nature of the &s;ubject is indeed &s;o foreign to my own bu&s;ine&s;s and way of life, that I &s;hould &s;carcely have pre&s;umed to med|dle with it, had not a point of good man|ners to this Gentleman fir&s;t of all induced me to do &s;o; but afterwards, when I had con&s;idered Dr. Kennicott's manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the title of this cata|logue, I thought my&s;elf obliged, through a de&s;ire of vindicating the Holy Scrip|tures, to apply as clo&s;ely to the examina|tion of this charge again&s;t them, as my &s;mall &s;hare of lei&s;ure would permit; be|ing apprehen&s;i&s;e that this paper might cau&s;e &s;uch prejudices again&s;t the integrity of the Text of the Old-Te&s;tament, as the
<PB N="5" REF="4">learned Author him&s;elf, perhaps, never conceived, and would be &s;orry to have occa&s;ioned by his catalogue.</P>
<P>The Letter to my friend, which was the re&s;ult of this examination, was at my de&s;ire &s;hewn to Dr. Kennicott; but the arguments therein had not &s;ufficient weight to convince him, that &s;ome apo|logy was nece&s;&s;ary to be made to his friends, to prevent their mi&s;interpreting his real de&s;ign in the &s;aid catalogue, and to remove all appearance of his having charged <Q><HI>the pre&s;ent Text of the Old-Te&s;|tament</HI></Q> with more faults than it really de&s;erves. Not being able however to lay a&s;ide my own apprehen&s;ions of the ill ef|fects which might po&s;&s;ibly be occa&s;ioned by this catalogue, I have therefore ven|tured to print &s;ome of my remarks upon it, le&s;t any per&s;on, not having lei&s;ure to examine it &s;ufficiently, &s;hould be led to conceive, that all the differences in
<PB N="6" REF="5">names and numbers, found therein, are really corruptions <Q><HI>in the pre&s;ent Text of the Old-Te&s;tament.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part of the Catalogue the Doctor has compared Ezra's account of the &s;acred ve&s;&s;els with the account given of the &s;ame in the Book of E&s;dras; and, as if he had <HI>clearly &s;hewn</HI> thereby &s;ome great corruptions, he has affixed the fol|lowing motto to his quotations; viz. <Q>non pote&s;t verum a&s;&s;eri, quod
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>(1) In the letter, which I &s;ent to my friend on this &s;ubject, I endeavoured to &s;hew, that a di&s;agreement in numbers, when the accounts of hi&s;torians are compa|red, is not a &s;ufficient authority to ju&s;tify a charge of corruption; and I &s;uppo&s;ed an example of two hi&s;tori|ans giving an account of the number of &s;lain in a battle; the one that 1000 men were killed, and the other that no le&s;s than 2000 were lo&s;t in the &s;ame battle; and I ob&s;erved, that, if the account is true of 2000 being killed, the other account cannot be called a contradic|tion to it, becau&s;e a le&s;s number is mentioned there|in; and this I thought &s;ufficient to exemplify, that a &s;maller number, when given <HI>without an ab&s;olute limita|tion,</HI> is no contradiction to a greater number. But it has been objected to this example, that it is <HI>by no means parallel to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, becau&s;e the numbers of &s;lain in battle in large armies, as given by Hi&s;torians,</HI> are, from the nature <HI>of the thing, hardly ever to be depended upon; where|as, when an inventory of goods is given, it is rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;ed to be exact to an unit, becau&s;e it ea&s;ily may be &s;o.</HI> I will therefore mention another example, not liable to the &s;ame objection, and more proper to be in&s;erted in the&s;e remarks becau&s;e it is quoted by Dr. <HI>Kennicott,</HI> (&s;ee page 532 of his 1&s;t di&s;&s;ertation,) viz. <Q><HI>In</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> iv. 26. <HI>we read that Solomon had</HI> 40,000 <HI>&s;talls for hor&s;es, but in</HI> 2 <HI>Chr.</HI> ix. 25. <HI>only</HI> 4,000.</Q> This Dr. <HI>Kennicott</HI> men|tions as one of the in&s;tances of <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> which <Q><HI>are mo&s;t ea&s;ilyaccounted for, by admitting the addition, omi&s;&s;ion, or tran&s;po&s;ition of a cypher:</HI></Q> and the Doctor's favourite Author, Father <HI>Houbigant,</HI> thinks to remove all difficul|ty from the &s;ame by altering the Text in 1 <HI>Kings</HI> iv. 26. from <GAP DESC="foreign"> to <GAP DESC="foreign"> viz. from 40,000 to 4,000.</P>
<P>But the ingenious Author of a &s;mall MS. book, lent me by a worthy and learned friend, (to whom I have great obligation on this, as well as many other ac|counts,) makes it appear very plainly, that the opinions of <HI>Bochart</HI> and <HI>Lud. Capellus</HI> (who think the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in&s;tead of 40 &s;hould be tran&s;lated 4) would cau&s;e greater difficulties than what are at pre&s;ent found in the Text; for, &s;ays he, <Q>let this Rabbinical u&s;e of plural ordinal numbers be what they plea&s;e; yet in the Scripture Style they are never taken &s;ingular|ly, and this I affirm after having examined &s;ome hundreds of places, where they are either joined with appellatives, per&s;ons, or things, or greater numbers, as an hundred or thou&s;and: and &s;o the&s;e <HI>Hebrew</HI> words <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignify 40,000 be|yond exception in all other Texts they are found in; and &s;o the LXX. turn them here, and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> pre|&s;erves the &s;ame high number.</Q> He then proceeds to &s;hew the great probability (<Q><HI>from the Riches and Gran|deur of Solomon,</HI> and the more terrible execution a <HI>Quadriga</HI> would make than a <HI>Biga,</HI></Q>) that <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Chariots were drawn by 4 hor&s;es; which opinion he &s;upports by a variety of quotations and learned argu|ments; and afterwards ob&s;erves, that, as <HI>Solomon</HI> had 1400 Chariots, (1 <HI>Kings</HI> x. 26. and 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> i. 14.) the number of hor&s;es, allowing 4 to each chariot, would require 5600 Stalls, be&s;ides the Stalls nece&s;&s;ary for the 12,000 &s;ingle Troop Hor&s;es; which numbers will oc|ca&s;ion great difficulties if we &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Solomon</HI> had only 4000 Stalls. He al&s;o ob&s;erves, that (be&s;ides the Stalls nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Solomon</HI>'s &s;tanding forces) &s;tandings were nece&s;&s;ary for hor&s;es pre&s;ented to him by foreign Princes, as al&s;o for Baggage Mules and Dromedaries, which mu&s;t be very numerous, not only for the carriage of provi&s;ions, tents, and other warlike nece&s;&s;aries both for hor&s;e and foot, but al&s;o for water, in the va&s;t &s;andy wild of Arabia De&s;erta as far as Euphrates. Moreover, he ob&s;erves, that as Solomon trafficked by his mer|chants with hor&s;es brought out of Egypt, furni&s;hing the Kings of Syria and the Hittites; <Q><HI>&s;o this running trade might occa&s;ion the&s;e &s;talls to be &s;o numerous, not on|ly &s;erving the purpo&s;es of war, but of traffick.</HI></Q> Many more rea&s;ons are given by the &s;ame Author, which are confirmed by a great variety of learned quotations and authorities; but, I tru&s;t, that tho&s;e few I have men|tioned are quite &s;ufficient to prove that Father <HI>Houbi|gant</HI> has been much too ha&s;ty in altering the Sacred Text from 40,000 to 4000, and that he has thereby loaded it with a real difficulty, when he might have avoided the imaginary one, by admitting a very rea|&s;onable and fair &s;olution, which has been approved of by a great variety of learned commentators; I mean that of con&s;truing the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> (not Stalls, but) Stables; which intirely removes all the difficulty: for, &s;uppo&s;ing each Stable capable of containing 10 Hor&s;es, you very ea&s;ily account for the number of 40,000 Stalls: and this opinion is approved of by Abarbinel, Junius, and Tremellius, Bp. Patrick, Sir Walter Raleigh, Mon&s;. Martin, and a great variety of other Commen|tators.</P>
<P>Some have indeed &s;uppo&s;ed, that the chariot Hor&s;es, &s;poken of in the parallel pa&s;&s;age in 2d Chronicles ix. 25. were but 4000, which King Solomon kept at or near Jeru&s;alem for his con&s;tant guard, and that the other &s;peaks of tho&s;e which were di&s;per&s;ed throughout his whole kingdom.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t material to my purpo&s;e is ob&s;erved by the author of the little treati&s;e above-mentioned; viz. <Q><HI>the diver&s;ity between the&s;e two relations</HI> (viz. in 1 Kings iv. 26, and 2 Chron. ix. 25.) amounts to 36,000; but, if the fir&s;t account is proved true,</Q> (which he mo&s;t clearly has done,) <Q><HI>the &s;econd mu&s;t be &s;o too, as the le&s;s is included in the greater number.</HI></Q> Now this is the very conclu&s;ion that I drew from my former example, (viz. of the two hi&s;torians giving dif|ferent accounts of the number of men &s;lain in a battle,) which was objected to: and this is another rea&s;on for my having quoted this example of Solomon's Hor&s;es; and I have the more plea&s;ure in doing &s;o, becau&s;e it is not liable to the &s;ame objection as the former, for the numbers therein may as <HI>rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be exact to a unit</HI> as the account of any <HI>other inventory</HI> whatever, becau&s;e it ea&s;ily might have been &s;o: we find likewi&s;e that the difficulty therein may rea&s;onably be accounted for without the &s;uppo&s;ition of a <HI>mi&s;take,</HI> or the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to Father Houbigant's dangerous and unwarrantable expedient of altering the text.</P></NOTE> ita diver&s;um e&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">But this account of E&s;dras is not <Q>ita diver&s;um</Q> as to amount to a contra|diction
<PB N="8" REF="7">of the other, and therefore the doctor's motto is not at all applicable.
<PB N="9" REF="8">For <HI>Ezra</HI> might at one time make particu|lar mention of &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els only as were
<PB N="10" REF="9">perhaps
<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>(2) A very apt and ingenious objection has been made to this argument, and communicated to the writer of the&s;e Remarks; who hopes that the worthy and learned Author will excu&s;e his in&s;erting it here at length, as the omi&s;&s;ion of it in this place might per|haps be deemed an inju&s;tice to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion. The Objection was as follows; <Q>That Ezra did not mean to mention particularly the chief ve&s;&s;els only, and then to include the re&s;t in the general round Sum 5400, is evident from hence, that he does do this be|fore he comes to make up the Sum 5400; for he throws together all the Ve&s;&s;els, not before &s;pecified, under the article <HI>other Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and into the general round Sum 1000: and this round Sum 1000, added to the particular Sums before &s;pecified, ought, in common &s;en&s;e, to make the Sum total; which here it does not do.</Q></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming propriety of this objection, yet, while there is any rea&s;onable way left of accounting for a difficulty, we ought to be very cau|tious of &s;uppo&s;ing a corruption; not from any idea of the <HI>ab&s;olute Integrity</HI> of the Hebrew Text, but becau&s;e many very learned and experienced per&s;ons have led them&s;elves and others into errors by e&s;teeming &s;ome difficult pa&s;&s;ages to be corrupt, when the truth and in|tegrity of the &s;ame might have been very &s;ufficiently vindicated.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, though I have not met with any thing, which, in my opinion, ought to be adopted as the only true interpretation, yet I think that one of the &s;olutions given by Bp. Patrick is &s;o far rea&s;onable, that it removes the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing a corrup|tion, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>It is &s;aid, in</HI> 2 Chron. xxxvi. 18. <HI>Nebu|chadnezzar carried away all the ve&s;&s;els both great and &s;mall. Now, in the account that is here given, the larger ve&s;&s;els only, which were of greater bigne&s;s and price, are mentioned.</HI></Q> (Among which are al&s;o reckoned the 1000 other Ve&s;&s;els; which <HI>round Sum</HI> was not inten|ded to make up the gro&s;s, but only to include all the other <HI>great</HI> or <HI>larger Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> the &s;pecies of which were not particularized, as Jo&s;ephus te&s;tifies
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And other <HI>great</HI> Ve&s;&s;els a thou&s;and.</NOTE>, <Q><GAP DESC="foreign"> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>) <Q><HI>But the gro&s;s Sum compre|hends all, both great and &s;mall, and amounts to the num|ber</HI> 5400.</Q></P></NOTE> chiefly u&s;ed, or were mo&s;t remarkable, and might mean to include
<PB N="11" REF="10">all the re&s;t in the <HI>general round</HI> Sum of 5400; and yet might afterwards think
<PB N="12" REF="11">proper to write a more circum&s;tantial hi&s;tory, &s;etting down the <HI>exact</HI> number of each kind of ve&s;&s;el, together with the <HI>particular</HI> amount or total of the whole.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign">. (30) and the <GAP DESC="foreign">. (30) corre&s;pond very well with the chargers of gold and ba&s;ons of gold, mentioned by <HI>Ezra.</HI> As to the other numbers, they all differ, as well from the account in <HI>Ezra,</HI> as from that in <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> except the 1000 other ve&s;&s;els; and the addition of the whole amounts to no more than 5210&mdash; yet, as he has not him&s;elf given a total number, he cannot be &s;aid to contradict either of the others. Now, as not one of the articles in the <HI>Heb.</HI> account of <HI>Ezra</HI> exceeds the numbers of tho&s;e in <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> there can be no contradiction therein, becau&s;e each number may be
<PB N="13" REF="12">included in the corre&s;ponding number in <HI>E&s;dras.</HI></P>
<P>And farther; if the number of each article in <HI>Ezra</HI> had been exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e in <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> the <HI>Sum To|tal</HI> 5400 would have appeared more like a mi&s;take; but, as they amount to no more than 2499, it is plain that the writer did not mean to enumerate every &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el; becau&s;e he afterwards gives a <HI>round</HI> Sum Total of <HI>even Hundreds,</HI> viz. 5400, which is more frequent in Hi&s;to|rians than exact and particular &s;ums: therefore a per&s;on mu&s;t be very little ac|quainted with Hi&s;tory, who &s;uppo&s;es that this is a contradiction to the Sum Total in <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>the odd number</HI> 69 is omitted
<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">(3) This numerical exactne&s;s in the Account of E&s;|dras, which is wanting in the Hebrew Account, has occa&s;ioned a &s;uppo&s;ition that the latter, by &s;ome means or other, has undergone &s;ome alteration. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that &s;ome ancient copies of the book of E&s;|dras have been <HI>equally exact</HI> in making the Sum total the amount of the &s;everal &s;orts of ve&s;&s;els to a unit, not|with&s;tanding that the particulars are very different, and that the Sum total exceeds the common reading by 391 ve&s;&s;els. The old Latin Bibles, from which the pre&s;ent Vulgate was taken, have the reading ju&s;t mentioned, which was probably tran&s;lated from MSS. as ancient as tho&s;e from which the pre&s;ent Greek Text of E&s;dras was taken: and the &s;ame reading is found in Tindal's old Engli&s;h Bible, printed in 1549. Therefore this numerical exactne&s;s is not a &s;ufficient proof of the au|thenticity of the book of E&s;dras in this place; &s;o that if the Heb. of Ezra was to be corrected by it to the &s;ame numerical exactne&s;s, and if <HI>&s;uch other</HI> corrections as have been propo&s;ed were to take place in the Text of the Old-Te&s;tament, I am apt to think that our Ho|ly Bible it&s;elf would &s;oon, by too many, be e&s;teemed as little better than apocryphal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">As to the difference of the names by which the Ve&s;&s;els are called, (however unlike they appear in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran|&s;lation,) yet whoever is acquainted with the original Text mu&s;t know that they corre&s;pond &s;ufficiently; except indeed the <HI>Heb.</HI> word, which is tran&s;lated <HI>knives;</HI> and that is capable of being con&s;trued &s;everal different ways, but there is not
<PB N="15" REF="14">the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it has been corrupted.</P>
<P>The next thing that I have to ob&s;erve is, that Dr. <HI>K.</HI> has been particularly un|fortunate in fixing upon this part of the &s;acred Hi&s;tory as a proof of <HI>the great cor|ruption of the proper names and numbers in the pre&s;ent Text of the Old-Te&s;tament.</HI> Fir&s;t,</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it was the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ba|bylonians</HI> to give new Names to their cap|tives; &s;o that it was very common a|mong the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Captives to be called by two names: of this the Book of <HI>Daniel</HI> gives &s;ufficient proof; and therefore this difference is of the le&s;s con&s;equence, be|cau&s;e two different names may mean the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, becau&s;e the&s;e three Books all agree in the &s;um total of per|&s;ons;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>(4) This agreement of the three Books in the &s;um total of Per&s;ons has occa&s;ioned a &s;uppo&s;ition, <Q>that the Catalogue in all three was originally the &s;ame; and that all three are now imperfect in &s;ome of the parti|culars, &s;ince the particulars in none of them now amount to the &s;um 42,360, which is &s;aid to be the &s;um of each.</Q> But there is no proof that the li&s;t, which Nehemiah found, was exactly the &s;ame with that from which Ezra copied; for many different ac|counts might have been taken by the Per&s;ons appoint|ed to number the people, even under the &s;ame title of <HI>the Children of the Province that went up out of Captivity,</HI> &amp;c. and though they might find it very ea&s;y to agree in the &s;um total, <HI>even to a unit,</HI> by reckoning the peo|ple, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, by fifties, hundreds, or thou&s;ands, (in which method the want of pedigrees would cau&s;e no difficulty,) yet in taking the numbers of the families &s;e|parately they might be very liable to differ, on account of the difficulty of a&s;certaining the legitimacy of &s;ome particular per&s;ons in many of the &s;aid Families.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved too, that not one of the three li&s;ts mentions the number of Prie&s;ts, who were rejected for want of proper Regi&s;ters, though the names of their fa|milies are the very la&s;t in each li&s;t, ju&s;t preceding the Sum total; &s;o that there is no doubt but that they are included therein notwith&s;tanding: therefore, as the con&s;ent of all three informs us, beyond contradiction, of the real Sum total, &s;o the want of the number of the&s;e Prie&s;ts <HI>in all three li&s;ts</HI> &s;eems <HI>as clearly</HI> to prove that the particular numbers in each were <HI>not intended</HI> to make up exactly the &s;aid Sum total; becau&s;e it mu&s;t otherwi&s;e &s;eem very unaccountable, that <HI>all the&s;e three Li&s;ts,</HI> as well as <HI>all the ancient ver&s;ions, which have been made from them,</HI> &s;hould happen to be corrupted <HI>in the &s;ame identical place.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Kennicott &s;eemed to be aware of this objection, when he fir&s;t <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> his Catalogue of names in his &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation, page 508, &amp;c. for he has there omitted the&s;e three la&s;t names, which have no num|bers &s;pecified, though he has thought fit to add them to his &s;econd Edition in the printed &s;heet; becau&s;e he mu&s;t have been convinced, that they ought to be in|cluded in the Sum total, notwith&s;tanding the triple evidence of the&s;e Li&s;ts, that <HI>no number ought to be added to the &s;ame;</HI> and, con&s;equently, that the exact number 42,360 was never intended to be made appear from the addition of the particular Sums in any of the&s;e Li&s;ts.</P></NOTE>; viz. 42,360; and yet none of their accounts amount to that &s;um by

<P>Now tho&s;e who content them&s;elves with the Doctor's Catalogue, without farther examination, may indeed ima|gine, that he has &s;hewn them <HI>mo&s;t clear|ly</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">&s;ome great corruptions of proper names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e he has <Q><HI>di&s;po&s;ed them in &s;uch a manner</HI></Q> as to compare the name <HI>Bezai</HI> in <HI>Ezra</HI> with <HI>Ha&s;hum</HI> in <HI>Nehemiah:</HI> and again, <HI>Jorah</HI> in <HI>Ezra</HI> with <HI>Bezai</HI> in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> which &s;hould have been placed in the line above; al&s;o <HI>Ha&s;hum</HI> in <HI>Ezra</HI> (which &s;hould have been placed two lines higher) with <HI>Hariph</HI> in <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> Likewi&s;e he has placed <HI>Lod</HI> oppo&s;ite to <HI>Jericho, Hadid</HI> to <HI>Lod, Ono</HI> to <HI>Hadid,</HI> and <HI>Jericho</HI> to <HI>Ono,</HI> each in a wrong line. So that he mu&s;t either allow this to be a great mi&s;take, or el&s;e that the&s;e names are <HI>"di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner"</HI> as to prove nothing at all of what he pre|tends
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">(5) By way of excu&s;e for Dr. Kennicott, it has been urged, that the names are taken in the order in which they &s;tand in each writer, to &s;hew how the order of the original Catalogue has been di&s;turbed, and that he did not intend to compare tho&s;e names, which are mani|fe&s;tly different, as if meant for the &s;ame per&s;on: but as no &s;ufficient evidence has ever yet been produced, that the order of the names has really been di&s;turbed, in any of the Li&s;ts, from what it was when written by the Authors of each; and as I have, in a former note, &s;hewn a probability, that the Catalogue in all three Li&s;ts <HI>was not originally exactly the &s;ame;</HI> and as this &s;eems to be proved by the&s;e very variations in the or|der of the names; therefore I think that the Doctor's <HI>manner of di&s;po&s;ing</HI> the names cannot with ju&s;tice be de|fended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">At the head of the names the Doctor has placed a Title, <HI>viz. "The Twelve Chief Men,"</HI> by which people may un|warily be led to &s;uppo&s;e that the chief men were confined to the limited num|ber of Twelve; but the Scriptures make no mention of a limited number of Chief Men
<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">(6) Dr. Kennicott neverthele&s;s informs us, in page 508, (Second Di&s;&s;ertation,) that the <HI>twelve Chiefs</HI> re|pre&s;ented the <HI>twelve Tribes.</HI></NOTE>, but only of names: therefore it is not an incon&s;i&s;tency in the account of <HI>Ezra</HI> to mention only Eleven names. On this account, likewi&s;e, the difference in the names is of le&s;s con&s;equence, be|cau&s;e it is not ea&s;y to prove that different per&s;ons were not intended to have been
<PB N="20" REF="19">expre&s;&s;ed thereby: on the other hand, it may be as difficult to prove that they were; though there is &s;ome appearance of a proof in one in&s;tance; <HI>viz.</HI> the names <HI>Reelius</HI> and <HI>Roimus</HI> in <HI>E&s;dras</HI> (if we con&s;ider the <HI>Greek</HI> manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ing <HI>Hebrew</HI> names) will an&s;wer very well to <HI>Reelaiah</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) in <HI>Ezra,</HI> and <HI>Raamiah</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) in <HI>Nehemiah;</HI> which la&s;t names Dr. K. has compared together as &s;uppo&s;ing them to have been originally the &s;ame, though the &s;imilar names ju&s;t mentioned in <HI>E&s;dras</HI> give us great rea&s;on to believe the contrary.</P>
<P>But, before I leave Dr. Kennicott's twelve Chief Men, I will endeavour to clear up another difficulty, and will now take his &s;ide of the que&s;tion to prove, that he has done right in comparing <HI>Re|hum</HI> in Ezra with <HI>Nehum</HI> in Nehemiah as the name of one man, notwith&s;tand|ing the great difference between them in
<PB N="21" REF="20">&s;ound, which may at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem to favour my &s;ugge&s;tion about different per|&s;ons; and I &s;hall have the more plea&s;ure in doing this, becau&s;e at the &s;ame time I &s;hall <HI>&s;hew mo&s;t clearly</HI> that neither the one nor the other is corrupted. Now every per&s;on, who is tolerably acquainted with the Chaldee and Syriac tongues, mu&s;t know, that N (<GAP DESC="foreign">) is frequently changed for R (<GAP DESC="foreign">) in words derived from the Hebrew, and therefore it is much more ea&s;y to believe that Nehemiah, like a Babylonian, wrote <GAP DESC="foreign"> for <GAP DESC="foreign"> (<HI>Nehum</HI> for <HI>Rehum</HI>) than to &s;up|po&s;e that either of the words has been &s;ince corrupted.</P>
<P>Whatever difference there may be be|tween Ezra and Nehemiah in numbers, (which are of le&s;s con&s;equence, as both of them fall &s;o far &s;hort of the total,) yet the difference in names is very imma|terial, though Dr. Kennicott has <Q><HI>di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="21">them in &s;uch a manner</HI></Q> as to make it &s;eem very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>There is but <HI>one name</HI> (viz. Hariph) in all this <HI>long li&s;t of Families,</HI> mentioned by Nehemiah, which has any material difference from tho&s;e mentioned by Ezra, and there are <HI>but four names</HI> in Ezra, viz. <HI>Jorah, Magbi&s;h, Hagab,</HI> and <HI>A&s;nah,</HI> which are not found in Nehemiah; therefore as there are no names in Ne|hemiah to compare with the&s;e la&s;t, ex|cepting the &s;ingle name <HI>Hariph,</HI> it is im|po&s;&s;ible for Dr. K. to prove <HI>any corrup|tion of names in the Hebrew text through|out this whole li&s;t of families.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the Doctor may imagine, that the difference of names in the Apocry|phal Greek book of E&s;dras is a &s;ufficient proof again&s;t the integrity of the Hebrew text of the other two; otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t allow, that his Catalogue proves very
<PB N="23" REF="22">little in this article of names. But, &s;up|po&s;ing that the&s;e differences were real contradictions, (which they are not,) the &s;u&s;picion of corruption mu&s;t of cour&s;e fall on the book of
<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">(7) See Dr. Kennicott's &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation on the State of the Hebrew Text, pages 506 and 507, where he intirely gives up the authority of the Book of E&s;|dras: &s;o that its te&s;timony ought to have but very little weight (e&s;pecially with Dr. K. him&s;elf) in correcting the Text.</NOTE> E&s;dras. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e the two be&s;t Greek copies of this &s;ame book (viz. the Vatican and Alexandrian copies) differ very much from each other both in the names and numbers.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e it is not of equal au|thority with the others, being apocry|phal, and therefore not received into the canon of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>And, Thirdly, Becau&s;e two evidences again&s;t one, though they were all to be of equal authority, would undoubtedly gain the cau&s;e in this critical trial.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="27">him&s;elf the trouble (for any thing that appears in the catalogue to the contrary) even to examine the original text; and that he has contented him&s;elf with &s;et|ting down the names and numbers mere|ly as they occurred in the Engli&s;h tran|&s;lation.</P>
<P>This is not le&s;s inju&s;tice than if a judge were to condemn a pri&s;oner merely from the report given of him by others, with|out permitting him to appear before him to an&s;wer for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My proofs of the Doctor's having mere|ly copied the Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion, I &s;hall take out of the book of E&s;dras: becau&s;e with that (I &s;uppo&s;e) he meant to cor|rect the Hebrew Text.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 13. He has taken the name <HI>Sadas,</HI> and the number 3222 only from the Engli&s;h ver&s;ion; for in the Alexan|drian
<PB N="29" REF="28">copy it is <GAP DESC="foreign"> (near to the He|brew <HI>Azgad</HI>) 3622; and <GAP DESC="foreign"> 2322 in the Vatican copy: &s;o that he trifles with the originals if he thinks in this manner to &s;hew their corruptions.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 14. He has placed the number 667 to Adonicam as in the Engli&s;h Ver|&s;ion of E&s;dras, whereas the Vatican copy reads 637, and the Alexandrian 647.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 16. <HI>Ananias</HI> is called <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the original Greek.</P>
<P><HI>Meterus</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed by <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the original Greek.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 25. <HI>Pha&s;&s;eron</HI> in the Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion and the Doctor's catalogue has the number 1047, but in the Vatican copy it has 2047, and in the Alexandri|an 2247. <HI>Carme</HI> as in the Engli&s;h Ver|&s;ion 1017, whereas the Vatican copy has only 217, and the Alexandrian 2017.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">Ver&s;e 37. <HI>Ladan,</HI> as in the Engli&s;h, which is <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the original.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the number of &s;ervants, 7347, is plainly a mi&s;take copied from the Eng|li&s;h Ver&s;ion; for the original Greek, as well as the Syriac Ver&s;ion of the &s;ame, is agreeable to the Hebrew 7337.</P>
<P>Now as many of the &s;eeming differ|ences (which the reader, as Dr. Ken|nicott &s;uppo&s;es in page 507, 2d Di&s;&s;er|tation, will view with &s;urprize) are not to be found in the original, but are oc|ca&s;ioned by the Doctor's copying merely from the Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion; as many other differences in names are cau&s;ed only by the changing of letters, according to the common Chaldaean mode of expre&s;&s;ing Hebrew words, and therefore are not liable to the charge of corruption; and as the mo&s;t material differences between Ezra and Nehemiah are made by the Doc|tor's having placed the names in the or|der
<PB N="31" REF="30">in which they &s;tand in each writer, which has cau&s;ed him to compare names manife&s;tly different, as if meant for the &s;ame per&s;on; &s;o I mu&s;t conclude (all the&s;e things con&s;idered) that not only the di&s;po&s;ition of names, but the whole per|formance is intirely unfair, becau&s;e the Doctor's motto leaves no room for allow|ances to be made for whatever may have occa&s;ioned the &s;everal &s;eeming differences, but condemns them indi&s;criminately with a bold in&s;inuation of fal&s;ehood, viz. <HI>Non pote&s;t verum a&s;&s;eri quod ita diver&s;um e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor in his printed Sheet has indeed placed this motto clo&s;e by the &s;ide of his quotation from the apocryphal Book of <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> but it is plain that he intended thereby to cen&s;ure the differ|ences in the whole catalogue, becau&s;e he prefixed the &s;ame unju&s;t motto to his <HI>fir&s;t publication</HI> of the Catalogue in his 2d Di&s;&s;ertation, p. 508.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">I call this motto unju&s;t, not only be|cau&s;e it is there applied indi&s;criminately to a quotation from two canonical Books of the Old-Te&s;tament, but becau&s;e St. <HI>Jerome</HI>'s authority is quoted for it, as if he had applied the &s;ame words, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to the Book of <HI>Ezra,</HI> though it appears very plainly by St. <HI>Je|rome</HI>'s preface to the &s;aid Book, that he was &s;peaking only of differences in the various copies of <HI>the Greek Ver&s;ion,</HI> when he made u&s;e of tho&s;e words.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the many faults, which I have found in the writings of this Gentleman, yet I have a much bet|ter opinion of him, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that he will ever endeavour to evade my cen|&s;ure of his Catalogue, by alledging that he did not mean by it to &s;hew the corrup|tions of the original Text, but only of the common <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation, which he has here copied word for word; and
<PB N="33" REF="32">that he meant the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation where he has mentioned <HI>the pre&s;ent Text of the Old Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding the improbabi|lity that there is of the Doctor's ever &s;eeking &s;uch an eva&s;ion, yet he mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me if I endeavour to guard again&s;t any &s;ort of &s;hifting-off from the point what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Therefore I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Text of any author cannot mean <HI>a Tran|&s;lation,</HI> e&s;pecially when a per&s;on is &s;peak|ing of corruptions in it; for the Corrup|tion of any Text mu&s;t mean &s;ome wilful or accidental alteration from the original copy of the Author.</P>
<P>No Per&s;on therefore, &s;peaking concern|ing the corruption in a Tran&s;lation of any Book, may &s;ay that they are corruptions of the <HI>pre&s;ent Text</HI> of the &s;aid book; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="33">at the &s;ame time perhaps the real and original text contains none of tho&s;e faults which he complains of.</P>
<P>So that, &s;hould the Doctor have really only meant to expo&s;e &s;ome defects, which he might imagine he had di&s;covered in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;ion, (though I cannot think that he intended any &s;uch thing by this Catalogue,) yet it mu&s;t appear to the Eyes of all tho&s;e who know him, and his pre|&s;ent undertaking, as if the&s;e unju&s;t cen|&s;ures were levelled at the Original Text it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are many other things, I believe, which might be alledged again&s;t this Ca|talogue, but I &s;hall only beg leave to trouble the reader with two more.</P>
<P>Though there might be many <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Families called after the names of places, as <HI>Bethlehem, Ramah, Jericho,</HI> &amp;c. yet
<PB N="35" REF="34">perhaps Dr. <HI>K.</HI> may have difficulty to prove that any <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Families were called <HI>Tel-melah, Telhar&s;a, Cherub,</HI> and <HI>Addan,</HI> (<HI>Immer</HI> the next name being indeed an exception,) although he has placed them in his li&s;t of families under the running Title of <HI>"The Children of."</HI></P>
<P>Now, if he had attended to the context, even of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation, he might have under&s;tood, that the&s;e were really the names of places, and not of families; for we are there informed, that the Families, afterwards mentioned, <Q>which <HI>went up from</HI></Q> <HI>the &s;aid places,</HI> <Q>&s;ought their regi&s;ter among tho&s;e that were rec|koned by genealogy, but they were not found.</Q></P>
<P>Another mi&s;take he has likewi&s;e made in comparing <HI>Cherub</HI> and <HI>Addan,</HI> the names of <HI>places</HI> in <HI>Ezra</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> with <HI>Charaathalar</HI> and <HI>Aalar,</HI> the names
<PB N="36" REF="35"><HI>of men</HI> mentioned by <HI>E&s;dras;</HI> though the context plainly &s;hews that there were no other than what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>I will not however in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e two la&s;t articles, becau&s;e I pre&s;ume that I have before &s;ufficiently proved, that this Cata|logue <HI>does</HI> <Q><HI>not &s;hew mo&s;t clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the pre&s;ent Text of the Old-Te&s;tament.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, le&s;t my cen&s;ure of this catalogue &s;hould &s;eem to &s;trike obliquely at Dr. Kennicott's pre&s;ent undertaking of col|lating the Heb. MSS. which has been honoured with the &s;ub&s;criptions of &s;o many great and learned per&s;ons; I think it nece&s;&s;ary, for my own &s;ake, as well as in ju&s;tice to Dr. Kennicott, to declare, that I think his collation of Hebrew MSS. a very laudable and u&s;e|ful undertaking; and that there cannot be the lea&s;t objection to his new Edi|tion
<PB N="37" REF="36">of the Heb. Bible, if printed ac|cording to the propo&s;als offered by him in the year 1760; viz. (<Q><HI>not with a new Text,</HI> but) <HI>from one of the be&s;t Edi|tions already publi&s;hed,</HI></Q> having the various readings in&s;erted at the bottom of every page.</P>
