<P>THE ground which is de&s;cribed in the following Sheets, has been for &s;ome centuries pa&s;&s;ed over by the incurious Traveller; and has had the hard for|tune of being con&s;tantly execrated for its dulne&s;s. To retort the charge, and clear it from the calumny, is my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s. To &s;hew that the road it&s;elf, or its vicinity, is replete with either antient hi&s;toric facts, or with matter worthy of pre&s;ent attention; is an affair of no great difficulty. Po&s;&s;ibly my readers may &s;ub|&s;cribe to the opinion, that the tract is not ab&s;olutely devoid of entertainment, and that the blame re&s;ts on them&s;elves, not the country.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER entertainment they may meet with, let them join with me in thanks to the following contri|butors. Fir&s;tly and chiefly, to the Reveread Mr. COLE

<HEAD>THE JOURNEY TO LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>IN MARCH 1780, I began my annual journey to <HI>London.</HI> At <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> &s;ome improvements had taken place &s;ince my la&s;t ac|count of the city. A very commodious building has been erected in the <HI>Yatchfield,</HI> near the <HI>Watergate</HI> &s;treet, for the &s;ale of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> linen at the two fairs. It &s;urrounds a large &s;quare area; on each &s;ide of which are piazzas, with numbers of &s;hops well adapted for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN digging the foundation for certain hou&s;es near the &s;treet, were di&s;covered &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> buildings, and a large <HI>Hypocau&s;t</HI> with its &s;everal conveniences; and &s;ome other antiquities, par|ticularly a beautiful altar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Engraven in <HI>Mo&s;es Griffith</HI>'s Supplemental Plates to the Tours in <HI>Wales,</HI> tab. X.</NOTE>, dedicated <HI>Fortunae Reduci</HI> et <HI>Ae&s;culapio.</HI> Much of its in&s;cription is defaced; but the rudder, cornucopia, rod, &s;erpent, and various &s;acrificial in&s;truments, are in good pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
ON leaving the city, I pa&s;&s;ed under the fine arch of the Ea&s;t Gate: a work owing to the munificence of Lord <HI>Gro&s;venor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boughton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BOUGHTON.</NOTE> a &s;uburb in the pari&s;h of St. <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> a little di&s;|joined from this part of the city, had before the di&s;&s;olution an ho&s;pital <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tanner,</HI> 65.</NOTE> for poor lepers, as early as the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> II. From an eminence, the retreat of the unfortunate brave, is a view of very uncommon beauty; of two fine reaches of the <HI>Dee,</HI> bounded on one part by meadows and hanging woods; on the other terminated by part of the city, the antient bridge, and over it a di&s;tant view of the <HI>Cambrian hills.</HI></P>
<P>ADJOINING to that part of <HI>Boughton</HI> which is within the liber|ties of the city, is the town&s;hip of <HI>Boughton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> the inhabitants of which appear at the court of the dean and chapter of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and pay there a chief rent: but u&s;ually clame and di&s;po&s;e of the wa&s;tes.</P>
<P>NEAR the two miles &s;tone I cro&s;&s;ed the canal to <HI>Chri&s;tleton,</HI> a pretty village, &s;eated, as u&s;ual with tho&s;e of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> on the free|&s;tone rock. <HI>Cri&s;tetone,</HI> as it is called in the <HI>Doom&s;day</HI> book, was held before the Conque&s;t by Earl <HI>Edwin.</HI> At that event, pro|bably, it had a chapel, or very &s;oon after. This manor had been be&s;towed by <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> on <HI>Robert Fitz Hugh,</HI> one of his follow|ers, who gave the chapel of <HI>Cri&s;tentune,</HI> with the land belonging to it, and the land of a certain pea&s;ant, with the pea&s;ant him&s;elf, to the abbey of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI> Mon. i. 201.</NOTE>. His great great grand-daughter <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> wife of Sir <HI>Philip Burnet,</HI> joined with her hu&s;band in &s;uing the abbey for this, and &s;ome other contiguous manors. It is pro|bable, that the monks might have taken an advantage of a fit of
<PB N="3" REF="8">
remor&s;e for &s;ome crime, or the weakne&s;s of an illne&s;s, to obtain this gift from her ance&s;tor. They thought fit to compromi&s;e the matter with her; and on payment of two hundred pounds re|ceived, in 1280, the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. a confirmation of the grant: and at the &s;ame time full liberty was given to the abbot to make a re&s;ervoir of water, and to convey it to the abbey.</P>
<P>IN the year 1282, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE WARREN.</NOTE> <HI>William de Birmingham</HI> had <HI>free warren</HI> given him of all his deme&s;ne lands in this village; but it is appre|hended he was only an inferior lord to the paramount privileges of the abbey. In the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, every man was allowed to kill game on his own e&s;tate, but on the Conque&s;t, the king ve&s;ted the property of all the game in him&s;elf, &s;o that no one could &s;port, even on his own land, under mo&s;t cruel penalties, without permi&s;&s;ion from the king, by grant of a cha&s;e or <HI>free warren.</HI> By this, the grantee had an exclu&s;ive power of killing game on his own e&s;tate, but it was on condition that he prevented every one el&s;e; &s;o that, as our learned commentator <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judge BLACKSTONE.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, this &s;eeming favor was intended for the pre&s;ervation of the bea&s;ts and fowls of <HI>warren;</HI> which were roes, hares, and rabbits, partridge, rails, and quails, woodcocks and phea&s;ants, mallards and herons, for the &s;port of our &s;avage monarchs. This liberty, which they allowed to a few individuals, being de&s;igned merely to prevent a general de&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tleton</HI> pa&s;&s;ed from the <HI>Birminghams,</HI> in <HI>Richard</HI> II.'s time; to Sir <HI>Hugh Brower:</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> lo&s;t it by his attachment to the hou&s;e of <HI>York;</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, in the fourth year of his reign, be|&s;towed it on <HI>John Manwaring,</HI> of <HI>Over Peover,</HI> an attendant on his
<PB N="4" REF="9">
&s;on, afterwards <HI>Henry</HI> V <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> 333.</NOTE>. <HI>Manwaring</HI> having no lawful i&s;&s;ue, be&s;towed this place on Sir <HI>Thomas le Gro&s;venor,</HI> lord of <HI>Hulme;</HI> but it pa&s;&s;ed immediately from him to <HI>John de Macclesfield,</HI> in the 10th of <HI>Henry</HI> V. One of his de&s;cendants alienated it, in 1442, or the 21&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to <HI>Humphrey</HI> (afterward Duke) of <HI>Buck|ingham. Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> &s;on to <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> &s;old it to Sir <HI>William Sneyde,</HI> of <HI>Keel;</HI> and Sir <HI>Ralph Sneyde,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Harpur,</HI> of <HI>Swer&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire;</HI> one of who&s;e de|&s;cendants &s;old it to <HI>Thomas Brock,</HI> E&s;quire, the pre&s;ent lord of the manor. The living is a rectory, in the di&s;po&s;al of Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn:</HI> the church dedicated to St. <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I took the hor&s;e-road acro&s;s <HI>Brownheath,</HI> by <HI>Hoc|kenball,</HI> formerly the &s;eat of a family of the &s;ame name. The ri&s;ing country to the left of this road appears to great advantage, oppo&s;ing to the traveller a fair front, beautifully clumped with, &s;elf-planted groves.</P>
<P>PASSED over a brook, and reached the &s;mall town of <HI>Tarvin,</HI> which &s;till retains nearly its <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> name <HI>Terf&ycirc;n,</HI> or the <HI>Boundary,</HI> and is &s;o to the fore&s;t of <HI>Delamere.</HI> In Doom&s;day book, it is &s;tiled <HI>Terve:</HI> the bi&s;hop at that time held it. It then contained &s;ix taxable hides of land. The bi&s;hop kept on it &s;ix cowmen, three radmen, &s;even villeyns, &s;even boors, and &s;ix ploughlands. The fir&s;t were to keep his cattle; the &s;econd to attend his per&s;on in his travels, or to go where&s;oever he plea&s;ed to &s;end them; the third, by their tenure, to cultivate his lands; and the fourth, to &s;upply his table with poultry, eggs, and other &s;mall matters. The <HI>ploughland,</HI> or <HI>caruca,</HI> was as much as one plough could
<PB N="5" REF="10">
work in the year. This &s;hews the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a manor in tho&s;e early times; which I mention now to prevent repetition.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Henry</HI> VI.'s time, the village and manor were e&s;timated at &pound;23 a year, and were held by <HI>Reginald,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as they were held by his predece&s;&s;ors, under the <HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> as earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> They continued po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them till the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when they were alienated to Sir <HI>John Savage,</HI> who procured for the town the privilege of a market. The church is a rectory, and &s;till continues part of the &s;ee of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> being a prebendary, originally founded about the year 1226, by <HI>Alexander de Stavenby,</HI> bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e. It is valued at &pound;26. 13<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> the highe&s;t endowment of any prebend in that cathedral. It is called the prebend of <HI>Tarvin,</HI> which pre&s;ents to the living.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame prelate al&s;o be&s;towed this church on the vice-pre|bendal church of <HI>Burton,</HI> in <HI>Wiral</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, i. 446.</NOTE>; and formed out of its reve|nues an ho&s;pital for &s;hipwrecked per&s;ons. This ho&s;pital was pro|bably at <HI>Burton, Tarvin</HI> being too remote from the &s;ea for &s;o hu|mane a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>AGAINST the church-wall is a monument, in memory of Mr. <HI>John Thoma&s;ine,</HI> thirty-&s;ix years ma&s;ter of the grammar-&s;chool. The epitaph de&s;ervedly celebrates the performances of this ex|qui&s;ite penman, as <Q>highly excelling in all the varieties of writ|ing, and wonderfully &s;o in the <HI>Greek</HI> characters. Specimens of his ingenuity are trea&s;ured up, not only in the cabinets of the curious, but in public libraries throughout the kingdom. He had the honour to tran&s;cribe, for her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="11">
the <HI>Icon Ba&s;ilike</HI> of her royal grandfather. Invaluable copies al&s;o of <HI>Pindar, Anacreon, Theocritus, Epictetus, Hippocrates</HI>'s <HI>Aphori&s;ms,</HI> and that fini&s;hed piece the <HI>Shield of Achilles,</HI> as de|&s;cribed by <HI>Homer,</HI> are among the productions of his celebrated pen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As his incomparable performances acquired him the e&s;teem and patronage of the great and learned; &s;o his affability and humanity gained him the good-will of all his acquaintance; and the decea&s;e of &s;o much private worth is regretted as a pub|lic lo&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Tarvin</HI> I travel on the great road, and at about two miles di&s;tance, leave on the right <HI>Stapleford,</HI> which retains the name it had at the Conque&s;t, when it was held by <HI>Radulpus Venator</HI> from <HI>Hugh Lupus.</HI> After a long interval, it fell to the <HI>Breretons.</HI> In 1378, or the &s;econd of <HI>Richard</HI> II. it was held by Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> of the king, as earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> From that family it pa&s;&s;ed to the <HI>Bruyns,</HI> and was purcha&s;ed by the late <HI>Randle Wil|braham,</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P>Two miles farther, on the left, &s;tood <HI>Utkinton Hall:</HI> the ma|nor, with <HI>King&s;ley,</HI> and the baileywick of the fore&s;t of <HI>Delamere,</HI> was given by <HI>Randle Me&s;chines,</HI> earl of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> to <HI>Randle de King&s;ley;</HI> who&s;e great grand-daughter <HI>Joan,</HI> about the year 1233, conveyed it to the <HI>Dones. Richard Done</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in 1311, the &s;ixth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. He held it by a quarter part of a knight's fee, and the ma&s;ter fore&s;ter&s;hip of <HI>Mere (Delamere)</HI> and <HI>Mottram,</HI> by him&s;elf, and a hor&s;eman and eight footmen under him, to keep that fore&s;t, then valued at &pound;10. 10<HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the failure of i&s;&s;ue male of Sir <HI>John Done,</HI> in the begin|ning of the la&s;t century, the manor of <HI>Utkinton</HI> came to his
<PB N="7" REF="12">
daughters, and has been &s;ince held by them, or per&s;ons claming under them. <HI>Mary,</HI> the &s;econd daughter, married, in 1636, <HI>John,</HI> &s;econd &s;on of Sir <HI>Randle Crew,</HI> of <HI>Crew;</HI> and <HI>Elinor,</HI> the younger, to <HI>Ralph Arderne,</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dones</HI> of <HI>Flaxyard,</HI> in this neighbourhood, were another con&s;iderable family, at con&s;tant feud with the former, till the hou&s;es were united by the nuptials of the heir of <HI>Flaxyard</HI> with the heire&s;s of <HI>Utkinton.</HI> But at this time, both tho&s;e antient &s;eats are demoli&s;hed, or turned into farm-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>FROM hence I &s;oon reached <HI>Torporley,</HI> a &s;mall town, &s;eated on a gentle de&s;cent. It had once been a borough town, of which <HI>Richard Francis</HI> was mayor in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. In the tenth of the &s;ame reign, <HI>Hugh de Tarpoley</HI> had licence to hold a market here every <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and a fair on the vigil, the fea&s;t-day, and the day after the exaltation of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s;</HI> but he alienated this privilege, with his property, to <HI>Reginald de Grey,</HI> chief ju&s;tice of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>IN the eighth of <HI>Richard</HI> II. this manor was divided into two moieties; one of which was held by <HI>John Done,</HI> the other by <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> of the family of Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> of <HI>Ruthin.</HI></P>
<P>THE manor and rectory of <HI>Torporley</HI> are now divided into &s;ix &s;hares: four belong to the <HI>Arderns;</HI> one to the dean and chap|ter of <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> and another to <HI>Philip Egerton,</HI> E&s;quire, of <HI>Oulton.</HI></P>
<P>THE living is a rectory in the gift of <HI>John Ardern,</HI> E&s;quire. The church is dedicated to St. <HI>Helen,</HI> the Empre&s;s of <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Coel,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> prince, a popular &s;aint among us, if we may judge from the number of churches under her protec|tion. That in que&s;tion is of no great antiquity, in re&s;pect to the
<PB N="8" REF="13">
building; nor yet of beauty. Within is much wa&s;te of good marble, in monumental vanity.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t, are two monuments in the chancel, &s;eemingly copied from half-length portraits, included in carved borders of marble, in imitation of frames. The figures are included in them in <HI>mezzo-relievo:</HI> the one of Sir <HI>John Done,</HI> Knight, hereditary fo|re&s;ter and keeper of the fore&s;t of <HI>Delamere,</HI> who died in 1629. His figure is picture&s;que, in a laced jacket, and a horn in his hand, the badge of his office: which horn de&s;cended to the different owners of the e&s;tate, and is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>John Ardern,</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P>WHEN that <HI>Nimrod, James</HI> I. made a progre&s;s in 1617, he was entertained by this gentleman at <HI>Utkinton;</HI> <Q>who ordered &s;o <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> and <HI>contentfully,</HI></Q> &s;ays <HI>King</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vale Royal, ii. 106.]</NOTE> <Q>his Highne&s;s's &s;ports, that <HI>James</HI> conferred on him the honor of knighthood.</Q> He married <HI>Dorothy,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Wilbraham,</HI> E&s;quire, of <HI>Woodhey;</HI> who left behind her &s;o admirable a character, that, to this day, when a <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> man would expre&s;s &s;ome excellency in one of the fair &s;ex, he would &s;ay, <HI><Q>There is Lady Done for you.</Q></HI></P>
<P>The other is of <HI>John Crew,</HI> E&s;quire, &s;econd &s;on of Sir <HI>Randle Crew,</HI> of <HI>Crew,</HI> Knight, married to <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>John Done.</HI> His face is repre&s;ented in profile, with long hair. He died 1670.</P>
<P>His lady, and her elder &s;i&s;ter <HI>Jane Done,</HI> an antient virgin, lie at full length in the <HI>Utkinton</HI> chapel, with long and excellent cha|racters. One lies recumbent; the other reclined and &s;trait laced,
<PB N="9" REF="14">

<P>I MUST not quit this place without letting fall a few tears, as a tribute to the memory of its hone&s;t rector <HI>John Allen;</HI> who&s;e an|tiquarian knowlege and ho&s;pitality, I have often experienced on this great thoroughfare to the capital. From the antient recto|rial hou&s;e, at the bottom of the town, is an aweful view of the great rock of <HI>Bee&s;ton,</HI> backed by the <HI>Peckfreton</HI> hills, tempting me to take a nearer &s;urvey.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tance is about two miles. In my way I cro&s;&s;ed the canal at <HI>Bee&s;ton Bridge,</HI> and called at the poor remains of <HI>Bee&s;ton Hall,</HI> the manor-hou&s;e, inhabited by the agent for the e&s;tate. This place was burnt by prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> during the civil wars. There is a tradition, that he had dined that day with the lady of the hou&s;e. After dinner, he told her, that he was &s;orry that he was obliged to make &s;o bad return to her ho&s;pitality; advi&s;ed her to &s;ecure any valuable effects &s;he had, for he mu&s;t order the hou&s;e to be burnt that night, lea&s;t it &s;hould be garri&s;oned by the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS manor had been part of the barony of <HI>Malpas,</HI> and was held under the lords, by the family of <HI>De Bunbury;</HI> who changed their <HI>Norman</HI> name, <HI>St. Pierre,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed that of the place where they fir&s;t &s;ettled.</P>

<HI>Actune,</HI> as it is &s;tiled in the <HI>Doom&s;day</HI> book, was a very con|&s;iderable place.

After his death, which happened in 1399, a magnificent tomb was erected beneath a Gothic arch, with a large embattled &s;uper|&s;tructure. Under the arch lies Sir <HI>William</HI> in full armour, with &s;uppliant hands. His head is ca&s;ed in a conic helm, bound with a fillet entwined with foliage. From his helmet is a guard of mail, which covers his neck, and ri&s;es to his lips; over which flow two great whi&s;kers. His head re&s;ts on a ca&s;que, with an a&s;s's head for a cre&s;t. Above, within the arch, is a row of half-lengths, with a book oppo&s;ite to each; probably religious, chaunt|ing his <HI>requiem.</HI> The whole is painted. On the edge of the tomb was this in&s;cription, now much defaced by time: <HI>Hic jacet William Manwaring quondam dominum de Badeleye, qui obiit die Veneris xx^o ante fe&s;tum Penteco&s;tae, anno Dni. m^occc^o nonoge&s;&s;imo nono.</HI></P>
<P>THE tomb of Sir <HI>Thomas Wilbraham,</HI> Baronet, and his lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Roger Wilbraham,</HI> Knight, and one of the Ma&s;ters of Reque&s;t to <HI>James</HI> I. is very hand&s;ome.

<P>THIS tomb is a &s;pecimen of the fir&s;t deviation of the old form: a greater ea&s;e of attitude began to prevail. The hands, which u&s;ed to be erect, clo&s;e, and &s;uppliant, here vary in the attitude, and &s;hew a dawning of the grace that reigned on the revival of &s;culpture.

WHEN entire, it was under the government of the lord, or his &s;teward; who were ve&s;ted with the u&s;ual baronial powers.

<P>THE next were the <HI>health-keepers;</HI> who attended to the right of the beam-heath, antiently called the <HI>creach;</HI> and took care to pre|&s;erve it from all incroachments, or tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>leave-lookers</HI> &s;uperintended the markets, in&s;pected the weights, and de&s;troyed unwhole&s;ome meat of every kind.

an almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s ornament to the country; nor has it, as might have been expected, given the le&s;t increa&s;e to the &s;alt-trade, for which this antient town was once &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed. Unfortunately for it, the other &s;alt-towns lie more conveniently for commerce, and abound almo&s;t to exce&s;s with that u&s;eful article.</P>
<P>THE chief trade of the place is in &s;hoes, which are &s;ent to <HI>London.</HI> Here is a &s;mall manufacture of gloves; but tho&s;e of bone-lace and &s;tockings, once con&s;iderable, are now lo&s;t.

<P>THE &s;alt made from the adjacent brine-&s;prings, formed once a very important bu&s;ine&s;s. In the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> here were two hundred and &s;ixteen &s;alt-works, of &s;ix <HI>leads-walling</HI> each: in 1774, only two works, of five large pans of wrought iron. The duty produced from them amounts annually to near five thou&s;and pounds: from the whole di&s;trict, including the works at <HI>Lawton,</HI> and a &s;mall one at <HI>Droitwich,</HI> from eighteen to twenty thou&s;and pounds. The tax on this u&s;eful article is very con&s;iderable; which it bears, as being of mo&s;t cheap fabrick, and mo&s;t univer&s;al u&s;e. It &s;eems, for that rea&s;on, to have been one of the earlie&s;t taxes of the <HI>Romans;</HI> for <HI>Ancus Martius,</HI> near 640 years before <HI>Chri&s;t, &s;alinarum vectigal in&s;tituit</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aurelius Victor,</HI> c. v.</NOTE>.

<P>IT is very probable that the <HI>Britons</HI> u&s;ed the &s;pring of <HI>Nant|wich</HI> for this purpo&s;e; numbers of pieces of half-burnt wood being frequently dug up in this neighborhood. <HI>Salinis</HI> was a place not far from hence, one of the wiches; but I am uncertain which. The <HI>Romans</HI> made u&s;e of the &s;prings, and made &s;alt by much the &s;ame proce&s;s as we do at pre&s;ent. The &s;alt produced was white.

<P>THE <HI>Romans</HI> were acquainted with rock-&s;alt, but had not di&s;|covered it within the limits of <HI>Italy.</HI> There were mountains of &s;alt in <HI>India.

but it was only to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo,</HI> 265.</NOTE> and the neighboring parts, which were remote from the &s;alt-&s;prings.</P>
<P>THESE advantages are but &s;paringly &s;cattered over <HI>Great Bri|tain: Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are totally de&s;titute of them.

<P>FROM that period to the pre&s;ent, they have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in u&s;e. The <HI>Saxons,</HI> according to their idea of liberty, divided them between the king, the great people, and the freemen. Thus, at <HI>Nantwich</HI> was one brine-pit, which gave employ to numbers of <HI>&s;alinae,</HI> or works. Eight of them were between the king and earl <HI>Edwin,</HI> of which the king had two &s;hares of the profits, the earl one. <HI>Edwin</HI> had likewi&s;e a work near his manor of <HI>Aghton,</HI> out of which was made &s;alt &s;ufficient for the annual con&s;umption of his hou&s;hold; but if any was &s;old, the king had a tax of two pence, and the earl of one penny.</P>
<P>IN this place were likewi&s;e numbers of works belonging to the people of the neighborhood; which had this u&s;age: From <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-day</HI> to the fea&s;t of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> they might carry home
<PB N="29" REF="38">
what &s;alt they plea&s;ed; but if they &s;old any on the &s;pot, or any|where in the county, they were to pay a tax to the king and the earl: but after the fea&s;t of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> who&s;oever took the &s;alt home, whether his own, or purcha&s;ed from other works, was to pay toll, except the before-mentioned work of the earl; which enjoyed exemption, according to antient u&s;age.</P>
<P>IT appears, that the king and earl farmed out their eight works; for they were obliged to give, on the <HI>Friday</HI> of the weeks in which they were worked, xvi. boilings; of which xv. made one <HI>&s;um</HI> of &s;alt. This is a mea&s;ure, which, according to <HI>Spelman,</HI> amounts to a hor&s;e-load, oreight bu&s;hels. The pans of other people, from <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-day</HI> to that of <HI>St. Martin,</HI> were not &s;ubject to this farm on the <HI>Friday;</HI> but from <HI>St. Martin's day</HI> to <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> they were liable to tho&s;e cu&s;toms, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the king and the earl.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> u&s;ed to &s;upply them&s;elves from the&s;e pits, before the union of our country with <HI>England. Henry</HI> III. in order to di&s;tre&s;s them, during the wars he had with them, took care to put a &s;top to the works, and deprive them of this nece&s;&s;ary article.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e &s;alt-works were confined between the river and a certain ditch. If any per&s;on was guilty of a crime, within the&s;e limits, he was at liberty of making atonement by a mulct of two &s;hillings, or xxx. boilings of &s;alt; except in the ca&s;e of mur|der or theft, for which he was to &s;uffer death. If crimes of that nature were committed without the precinct, the common u&s;age of the county was to be ob&s;erved.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Germans</HI> had an idea of a peculiar &s;anctity attendant on &s;alt-&s;prings; that they were nearer to heaven than other places; that the prayers of mortals were nowhere &s;ooner heard; and that, by the peculiar favor of the gods, the rivers and the woods were productive of &s;alt, not, as in other places, by the virtue of the &s;ea, but by the water being poured on a burning pile of wood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Taciti Annal.</HI> xiii. c. 57.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AMONG many other pri&s;oners of di&s;tinction taken by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> was Colonel <HI>George Monk,</HI> in after-times the famous in|&s;trument of the re&s;toration of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Fairfax</HI> was &s;o well ac|quainted with his merit, that he was determined that he never &s;hould have an opportunity of exerting his courage again in the royal cau&s;e. He &s;ent him up to <HI>London,</HI> where he was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower, and confined near four years. On his re|lea&s;e he joined the parlement; but, through a &s;en&s;e of honor, de|clined acting again&s;t his old ma&s;ter: and employed his &s;word again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> rebels, in which &s;ervice he was engaged till after the death of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Nantwich</HI> was the re&s;idence of the widow of the great <HI>Milton,</HI> during the latter part of her life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Life of Milton</HI> by Bi&s;hop <HI>Newton.</HI> She died in a very advanced age, in <HI>March</HI> 1726.</NOTE> She was the daughter of Mr. <HI>Min&s;hul,</HI> of <HI>Stoke,</HI> in this neighborhood. The poet married her in the fifty-third or fifty-fourth year of his age, wanting, in the &s;ea&s;on of his infirmities, a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a dearer relation than that of dome&s;tics. I fear that he was di&s;appointed; for &s;he is &s;aid to have been a lady of mo&s;t violent &s;pirit. Yet &s;he maintained a

great re&s;pect for his memory; and could not bear to hear the lea&s;t imputation of plagiari&s;m a&s;cribed to him. She u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he &s;tole from nobody but the mu&s;e who in&s;pired him; and that mu&s;e was <HI>God's grace,</HI> and <HI>the Holy Spirit, which vi|&s;ited him nightly.</HI> She probably had heard him &s;ay as much, in the compo&s;ition of his invocation to <HI>Urania,</HI> in his 7th book:

<P>I CONTINUED my journey along the <HI>London</HI> road, flat, tedious, and heavy. At the fourth &s;tone lieth, a little out of the way, <HI>Wibbunbury,</HI> a &s;mall village, &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken, its name from <HI>Wibba,</HI> &s;econd king of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> who died in 615. The manor was antiently in the great family of the <HI>Praers.</HI> Sir <HI>Ro|bert de Praer</HI> gave it to his &s;on <HI>Richard,</HI> about the reign of King <HI>John,</HI> upon condition of rendering to the heirs of his elder bro|ther two barbed arrows yearly, on the fea&s;t of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in lieu of all other &s;ervices. But the <HI>Praers</HI> remitted all their right in this manor, and the patronage of the church, to the bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> in 1276, the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and the bi&s;hops continued to be lords of the manor
<PB N="37" REF="47">
till the &s;econd of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> about which time it was alienated: but the bi&s;hops &s;till continue patrons of the church.</P>
<P>THERE had been, in much earlier times, a family in this place which took their name from it; for <HI>Richard de Wibbunbury</HI> was &s;heriff of <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> in 1233. Whether the <HI>Praers</HI> ever a&s;&s;umed that name, is uncertain. It is probable, that the <HI>Richard</HI> above|mentioned was the &s;ame with the &s;heriff, and took the addition on receiving the place from his father.</P>
<P>THIS village was formerly &s;urrounded with gentlemen's &s;eats. Among tho&s;e was <HI>Lee,</HI> the re&s;idence of a family of the &s;ame name; from which were de&s;cended the <HI>Lees,</HI> earls of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> derived from <HI>Benedict,</HI> a &s;on of this hou&s;e, who made a &s;ettlement at <HI>Quarendon,</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV.</P>
<P>THE church is a very hand&s;ome building, embattled and pin|nacled: the tower lofty; the roof is timbered on the in&s;ide, and carved with the arms of the various benefactors. Part of the church was taken down in 1591; at which time many of the monuments were de&s;troyed: of tho&s;e remaining, are &s;everal in memory of the <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Doddington.</HI> The mo&s;t antient is a large altar-tomb of alaba&s;ter, with the figures of a father, and &s;on, and lady, engraven on the &s;tone: at the feet of each is a dog, and be|neath, a dolphin: on the front of the tomb, &s;everal figures, their progeny. The per&s;ons repre&s;ented are Sir <HI>John Delves,</HI> his &s;on <HI>John,</HI> and his wife <HI>Ellen,</HI> daughter of <HI>Ralph Egerton,</HI> of <HI>Wrinehill,</HI> in the county of <HI>Stafford;</HI> for which, probably on account of con&s;anguinity, a di&s;pen&s;ation was granted in 1439 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collin's Baronet.</HI> ed. 1720, p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John</HI> was in high favor with <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and enjoyed &s;everal
<PB N="38" REF="48">
lucrative po&s;ts under him. This he repaid with the mo&s;t faithful adherence, rai&s;ed forces in his &s;upport, and lo&s;t his life valiantly fighting, in the fatal field at <HI>Tewke&s;bury,</HI> on <HI>Saturday, May</HI> the 4th, 1471. His &s;on, with numbers of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, took refuge in the abbey. The furious <HI>Edward</HI> pur&s;ued them, with his drawn &s;word, into the church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow's Annals,</HI> 424.</NOTE>; but was oppo&s;ed by a re&s;olute prie&s;t, who for the pre&s;ent diverted his vengeance by li&s;ting up the <HI>ho&s;t,</HI> interpo&s;ing the &s;acred my&s;tery, and denied him admit|tance till he obtained a promi&s;e of pardon; depending on the king's word, they neglected making their e&s;cape, and continued in the &s;anctuary till the <HI>Monday,</HI> when the relentle&s;s monarch cau&s;ed them to be drawn out and beheaded, according to the cu&s;tom of the times, without any proce&s;s. The bodies of this unfortunate pair were at fir&s;t buried at <HI>Tewke&s;bury</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland Itin.</HI> vi. 88.</NOTE>, but after|wards tran&s;lated to this place; where their remains lie, with the following in&s;cription:</P>

<P>THE tomb of Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> of the <HI>Hough,</HI> in this pari&s;h, and his lady, is magnificent in its kind. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> lies beneath a canopy, &s;upported by four pillars of the <HI>Ionic order,</HI> of white marble, gilt and painted. He is repre&s;ented recumbent and

His lady (<HI>Anne,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI>) has a fa&s;hionable fore-top, a great ruff, and extended hood.

<P>THESE, and many other advantages, are derived, both to indi|viduals and the public, from this internal navigation. But when it happens that the kingdom is engaged in a foreign war, with what &s;ecurity is the trade between tho&s;e three great ports carried on; and with how much le&s;s expence has the trader his goods conveyed to any part of the kingdom, than he had for|merly been &s;ubject to, when the goods were obliged to be car|ried coa&s;tways, and to pay in&s;urance?</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it may be a&s;&s;erted, that no undertaking, equally ex|pen&s;ive and arduous, was ever attempted by private people in any kingdom; and, in ju&s;tice to the adventurers, it mu&s;t be allowed, that, con&s;idering the difficulties they met with, owing to the na|ture of the works, or the caprice of per&s;ons who&s;e lands were taken to make the canal, that ten years and a half was but a &s;hort time to perform it in; and that &s;atisfaction has been made to every individual who &s;uffered any injury by the execution of the undertaking. The profits ari&s;ing from tonnage is already very con&s;iderable; and there is no doubt but they will increa&s;e annually; and, notwith&s;tanding the enormous &s;um of money it has co&s;t in the execution, the proprietors will be amply repaid, and have the comfort to reflect, that, by the conclu&s;ion of this project, they have contributed to the good of their country, and acquired wealth for them&s;elves and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after leaving <HI>Stonefield,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">STONE</NOTE> reached the little town of <HI>Stone,</HI> a place remarkable for religious antiquity. <HI>Legend</HI> tells
<PB N="57" REF="71">
us, that the before-mentioned <HI>Wulferus,</HI> then a Pagan, put to death his two &s;ons, <HI>Wulfad</HI> and <HI>Rufin,</HI> on &s;u&s;picion of favoring the Chri&s;tian faith; <HI>Wulfad</HI> at this place, <HI>Rufin</HI> at <HI>Bur&s;ton,</HI> about three miles di&s;tant. Over each, &s;tones were erected, as u&s;ual, in memory of the dead; from whence the names of tho&s;e places are derived. <HI>Wulfere,</HI> after this unnatural deed, was &s;truck with the utmo&s;t remor&s;e, and, by the influence of his queen and St. <HI>Cedda,</HI> or <HI>Chad,</HI> who lived in a neighboring hermitage, was converted to the religion he had &s;o lately per&s;ecuted; and, by way of expiat|ing his guilt, among other works of piety, founded at <HI>Stone</HI> a college of canons regular, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COLLEGE.</NOTE> about the year 670. His queen <HI>Er|menilda</HI> is &s;aid to have al&s;o founded a nunnery here. On the in|va&s;ion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> the religious were di&s;per&s;ed; but on the abatement of the cruelty of tho&s;e barbarians, it is probable they returned, or at left a new e&s;tabli&s;hment was formed. This is certain, that religious were found here after the Conque&s;t; for there is an idle tale of two nuns and a prie&s;t being &s;lain there, by <HI>Eny&s;an,</HI> a <HI>Norman.</HI> This <HI>Eny&s;an,</HI> of <HI>Walton,</HI> was the true re-founder. Caution mu&s;t be u&s;ed in reading the hi&s;|tories of the&s;e times, which are filled with pious romance. Little credit &s;hould al&s;o be given to the murder of the &s;ons of <HI>Wulfere.</HI> The <HI>Saxon Chronicle</HI> is &s;ilent about the deed. That prince was a convert to Chri&s;tianity, and &s;eems to have founded the hou&s;e through the common motives of zeal.</P>
<P><HI>Eny&s;an,</HI> on his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of this hou&s;e, filled it with canons from <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> and made it a cell to that place. The <HI>Staffords,</HI> who were his &s;uperiors, a&s;&s;umed the honor of this new foundation; and a &s;econd <HI>Robert de Stafford,</HI> about the year 1260, rendered it free from <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> excepting the right of patron|age,

and a yearly pen&s;ion. The church of this priory was the place of interment of &s;everal of this great family; and numbers of magnificent tombs, with their figures in alaba&s;ter, lay there till the di&s;&s;olution; when they were removed to the <HI>Augu&s;tines,</HI> on <HI>Stafford Green.</HI> I &s;ee on the road-&s;ide a fragment of a thick wall, perhaps a remnant of the priory. The church is quite new, and is a very elegant building, dedicated to St. <HI>Wulfad,</HI> one of the &s;uppo&s;ed martyrs. At the time of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, a tablet, giving the whole hi&s;tory of the hou&s;e, was hung up in the priory: it is related in old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> metre; but is &s;o tedious, that I mu&s;t refer the readers, who de&s;ire to peru&s;e it, to the cited author. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale Mon.</HI> ii. 126.</NOTE></P>

Walter,</HI> the la&s;t of the line, left two daughters; the &s;e|cond (who only had children) conveyed by marriage the e&s;tate to Sir <HI>James Simeon,</HI> who rebuilt the hall. He al&s;o built in the garden a <HI>mau&s;oleum;</HI> in which, I think, he is interred. The place is at pre&s;ent the property of <HI>Edward Weld,</HI> E&s;quire, of <HI>Lulworth</HI> ca&s;tle, in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and de&s;cended to him of late years, by virtue of a marriage of an ance&s;tor with a daughter of this hou&s;e, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>THE road from this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BURSTON.</NOTE> for &s;everal miles, pa&s;&s;es along a pretty vale, watered by the <HI>Trent,</HI> bounded by two hills, and much enlivened by the cour&s;e of the canal.

<P>THE antient man&s;ion &s;tood near the church, within a moat; but is now demoli&s;hed, and a beautiful hou&s;e, commanding a fine view, was built by Lord <HI>Archibald Hamilton,</HI> on an eminence im|pending over the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> road.

a faithful guide of all that concerned the families, till his death, which happened in 1603. He might have &s;pared him&s;elf the ex|pence of a monument; his work would have perpetuated his name. He erected one in his life-time; and is repre&s;ented recumbent, a colo&s;&s;al figure in a jacket with &s;hort &s;kirts, and &s;purs on his legs. Above, in two niches, are his two wives, kneeling: the one was <HI>Elizabeth Dike&s;wel;</HI> the other <HI>Maria Neale,</HI> widow to Sir <HI>Everard Digby,</HI> and mother to the unfortunate victim to the gunpowder plot.

<P>THE hor&s;e-bridge over the <HI>Trent,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ITS LONG BRIDGE.</NOTE> adjoining to <HI>Heywood,</HI> was not le&s;s remarkable, for I remember it to have con&s;i&s;ted of two-and-forty arches; but the number at pre&s;ent is much le&s;&s;ened.

There certainly had been a bridge here long before, &s;o that, if there was any foundation for &s;uch a mark of re&s;pect, it could only have been rebuilt after falling to decay.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t pe&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of this manor was Sir <HI>Walter de Somervile,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> on whom it was be&s;towed by the Conqueror.

<P>THIS had been a place belonging to the bi&s;hops of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> which, with the manors of <HI>Longdon, Heywood, Berk&s;wick, Cank, Rudgley,</HI> and <HI>Shugborrow,</HI> were part of the &s;poils of that &s;ee, wre&s;ted from it in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. with the connivance of <HI>Richard Samp&s;on,</HI> then bi&s;hop, who accepted in their &s;tead certain impro|priations of the value of an hundred and eighty-three pounds a year. The&s;e livings at that time were good rectories; now poor vicarages, or mercenary curacies, annexed to the bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>THE leviathan who &s;wallowed the&s;e manors, was Sir <HI>William Paget,</HI> created by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Baron <HI>Beaude&s;ert.</HI> He fir&s;t appeared in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and from a low beginning, merito|riou&s;ly ro&s;e to the dignity of &s;ecretary and amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>Francis</HI> I. In the next reign, he was made chancellor of the dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and comptroller of the hou&s;hold; and obtained a peerage. In that of <HI>Mary,</HI> became lord privy-&s;eal, and was re|&s;tored to the order of the Garter, from which he had been de|graded in the time of her predece&s;&s;or. At the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> at his own reque&s;t, he was permitted to retire from the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, being zealou&s;ly attached to the religion of his

The reforming <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and the papal <HI>Paget,</HI> agreed in that &s;ingle point. His po&s;terity derive from him an uncommon extent of in|tere&s;t and command.</P>

<P>AFTER a &s;hort ride, I reached the &s;ummit of a long but gentle de&s;cent, from which is a fine view of the city of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> lying at the foot of it. The &s;ituation is delightful, in a fertile and dry &s;oil, with &s;mall ri&s;ings on almo&s;t every &s;ide. The cathedral, with its three &s;pires, is a mo&s;t &s;triking object.</P>
<P><HI>Lichfield</HI> is a place of <HI>Saxon</HI> origin, <NOTE PLACE="marg">LICHFIELD.</NOTE> and owes its ri&s;e to <HI>Ceadda,</HI> or <HI>Chad,</HI> the great &s;aint of <HI>Mercia.</HI> I omit the legend of the thou&s;and Chri&s;tians, di&s;ciples of St. <HI>Amphibolus,</HI> that were mar|tyred here under <HI>Diocle&s;ian;</HI> or the three kings &s;lain at this place in battle, as &s;culptured over the-town-hall.

AFTER a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of twelve prelates, <HI>Walter de Langton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BISHOP LANGTON</NOTE> trea|&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, in 1296.

After a per&s;ecution and confinement of above two years, he emerged from all his difficul|ties, and re&s;umed his pa&s;toral charge in a manner that did him great honor. He may be con&s;idered as the third architect of this cathedral: to him we are indebted for the pre&s;ent elegant pile. He laid the foundation for our Lady's chapel; an edifice of un|common beauty, fini&s;hed after his death with money left for that purpo&s;e. He built the cloy&s;ters, and expended &pound;2,000 upon a &s;hrine for St. <HI>Chad.</HI> He be&s;towed on the choir &s;everal rich ve&s;t|ments, a chalice, and two cups of beaten gold, to the value of &pound;200. To the vicars choral he gave a &s;tanding cup, and an annual pen&s;ion of &pound;20, and procured for them and the canons great immunities: in particular, there was an order from the king to the ju&s;tices of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> that, without trial, they &s;hould hang upon the next gallows divers per&s;ons that by force kept their lands from them. This prelate al&s;o &s;urrounded the clo&s;e with a wall and ditch, made the great gate at the we&s;t end, and the po&s;tern at the &s;outh. He gave his own palace, at the we&s;t end of the clo&s;e, to the vicars choral, and built a new one for him&s;elf at the ea&s;t end. He partly built, or enlarged, the ca&s;tle at <HI>Eccle&s;hal,</HI> and the manors of <HI>Heywood</HI> and <HI>Shugborow,</HI> and the palace in the <HI>Strand.</HI> He fini&s;hed his u&s;eful life in <HI>November</HI> 1321, and was buried in the chapel of his own founding.</P>

<P>THE roof was till of late covered with lead, but grew &s;o greatly out of repair, that the dean and chapter were obliged to &s;ub&s;titute &s;lates in&s;tead of metal, on account of the narrow revenues left to maintain this venerable pile; and, after the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, they will be under the nece&s;&s;ity of contributing from their own income, in order to complete their plan.

<P>THE body is lofty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BODY.</NOTE> &s;upported by pillars formed of numbers of &s;lender columns, with neat foliated capitals. Along the walls of the ailes are rows of fal&s;e arches, in the gothic &s;tile, with a &s;eat beneath.</P>

<P>IN each tran&s;ept are two places, formerly chapels; at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;tory courts, and the vicar's ve&s;try-room.</P>
<P>THE choir merits attention, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CHOIR.</NOTE> on account of the elegant &s;culp|ture about the windows, and the embattled gallery that runs be|neath them.

<P>THE antient name of this place was <HI>Al&s;path,</HI> or <HI>Aile&s;pede,</HI> even till the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI; about which time, becoming a great thoroughfare, it got the name of <HI>Myreden; den</HI> &s;ignifying a bottom, and <HI>myre,</HI> dirt: and I can well vouch for the propriety of the appellation, before the in&s;titution of turn|pikes.</P>

<P>I CONTINUED my way to <HI>Coventry</HI> through <HI>Alle&s;ey,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">ALLESEY.</NOTE> a village with a church and &s;pire-&s;teeple.

<P>Legend &s;ays, that previous to her ride, all the inhabitants were ordered, on pain of death, to &s;hut them&s;elves up during the time; but that the curio&s;ity of a certain taylor, overcoming fear, took a &s;ingle peep; which is commemorated even at pre&s;ent, by a figure looking out of a wall in the great &s;treet.

<P>I MUST remark, that in the beginning, or middle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BLUE THREAD.</NOTE> of the &s;ix|teenth century, <HI>Coventry</HI> had a va&s;t manufacture of blue thread; which was lo&s;t before the year 1581 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ander&s;on's Dict.</HI> i 422.</NOTE>.

<P>ABOUT eighty years ago, <NOTE PLACE="marg">RIBANDS.</NOTE> the &s;ilk manufacture of ribands was introduced here, and, for the fir&s;t thirty years, remained in the hands of a few people, who acquired va&s;t fortunes; &s;ince which, it has extended to a great degree, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to employ at left ten thou&s;and people; and has likewi&s;e &s;pread into the neighboring towns, &s;uch as <HI>Nuneaton,</HI> and other places.

THE military tran&s;actions of this city are very few. It was an open town for many centuries, and, of cour&s;e, incapable of &s;u&s;|taining a &s;iege. The walls were not begun till the year 1355, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> and then by virtue of a licence granted by <HI>Edward</HI> III. twenty-&s;even years before; nor were they fini&s;hed in le&s;s than forty. They were built by money rai&s;ed by taxes, and by cu&s;toms on the wine, malt, oxen, hogs, calves, and &s;heep, con&s;umed in <HI>Co|ventry.</HI> The&s;e walls were of great &s;trength and grandeur, fur|ni&s;hed with thirty-two towers and twelve gates. The&s;e continued till the 22d of <HI>July</HI> 1661, when great part of the wall, and mo&s;t of the towers, and many of the gates, were pulled down, with certain circum&s;tances of di&s;grace, as a puni&s;hment for the di&s;loy|alty of the inhabitants, in &s;hutting their gates again&s;t their mo|narch <HI>Charles</HI> I. on the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1642. His maje&s;ty, after &s;etting up his &s;tandard at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> had &s;ent to this city, to acquaint them that he meant to re&s;ide there for &s;ome time, and de&s;ired quarters for his forces in and about the place. The mayor and aldermen, with many expre&s;&s;ions of affection, offered to receive the king, but refu&s;ed admittance to any of the &s;oldiery. Incen&s;ed at this, his maje&s;ty attacked the city, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CITY ATTACKED BY CHARLES I.</NOTE> and with his ord|nance forced open one of the gates; but was repul&s;ed by the valour of the citizens, and obliged to retire with lo&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vicar's Parliament, Chron.</HI> 141.</NOTE>.

<P>I SHOULD have mentioned before, that in the fifteenth century another monarch had been denied the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this city. The great Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> armed it again&s;t <HI>Edward</HI> IV. in 1470,
<PB N="144" REF="161">
when he attempted entering on the &s;ide of <HI>Gosford Green.</HI> The king amply repaid the in&s;ult on the citizens, who perhaps acted by con&s;traint. He deprived them of their privileges, and made them pay five hundred marks for the recovering of them, by having the &s;word re&s;tored to them.</P>
<P>BEFORE the building of the walls, <NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTLE.</NOTE> there had been, from very early times, a ca&s;tle on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, near <HI>Chyle&s;|more,</HI> with a park belonging to it. This had been the re&s;idence of the kings and earls of <HI>Mercia:</HI> it afterwards fell to the earls of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and at length was ve&s;ted in the royal line. No ve&s;tige of it is now to be &s;een: in its place is a very antient wooden building, the remains of the manor-hou&s;e of <HI>Chyle&s;more,</HI> probably built after the demolition of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Stephen</HI> forcibly took this fortre&s;s from <HI>Randle de Gernons</HI> earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The earl, in 1146, attempted to reduce it, not by &s;iege, but by erecting a fort near it, in order to di&s;tre&s;s the gar|ri&s;on, by cutting off &s;upplies. The king twice attempted its re|lief; the fir&s;t time without &s;ucce&s;s, but in the &s;econd action he defeated the earl; forced him to fly, covered with wounds; <NOTE PLACE="marg">DEMOLISHED.</NOTE> and then demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leice&s;ter's Che&s;hire ex ge&s;tis Stephani,</HI> 124.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE number of inhabitants, taken at different periods, <NOTE PLACE="marg">NUMBERS.</NOTE> in the la&s;t two hundred years, is very different.

To re|medy this evil, <HI>Edward</HI> VI. granted the city a charter for an ad|ditional fair. To this cau&s;e perhaps was owing the increa&s;e, by the year 1586, to 6502.

At length, in 1399, licence was given for celebrating divine &s;ervice here, provided it might be done without injury to the mother-church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd.

<P>BEHIND this church is <HI>Bablake</HI> ho&s;pital, <NOTE PLACE="marg">BABLAKE HOSPITAL.</NOTE> an old building, with a court in the middle: one part is occupied by <HI>Bond</HI>'s alms-hou&s;es, founded in 1506, by <HI>Thomas Bond,</HI> mayor of <HI>Coventry</HI> in 1497, for ten poor men and one poor woman, with a prie&s;t to pray for the &s;oul of the founder, his grandfather, father, and all Chri&s;tian &s;ouls. At that time the revenues were &pound;49. 11<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI> In the fir&s;t of <HI>Edward</HI> VIth's time, they were ve&s;ted in the city; and, the revenues being improved, at pre&s;ent they maintain eighteen old men and a nur&s;e, each of whom have three &s;hillings a week, a black gown, and other emoluments <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd.

About the year 1619, an infernal ambition of becoming chief of the hou&s;e, &s;eized one of the alms-men; who, to attain his end, poi&s;oned eight of his bre|thren; five of whom in&s;tantly died. On detection, the wretch effected his own de&s;truction by the &s;ame method, and was buried with the u&s;ual marks of infamy. Had his fortune flung him into a higher &s;tation, his deeds would have paralleled him with <HI>Ce&s;ar Borgia,</HI> or his more mon&s;trous father, Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI.</P>
<P>THE other part of the building is allotted for the blue boys: a foundation owing to a very &s;ingular accident.

When they were brought home and examined, they were found to contain cochineal and ingots of &s;ilver. Mr. <HI>Wheatly</HI> kept them for a con&s;iderable time, in hopes of di&s;covering the owner;

for his &s;ervant did not know from whom he bought them. At length he applied the profits, as well as much of his own e&s;tate, for the &s;upport of poor children.</P>

<P>AT the lower end of this &s;treet is the free-&s;chool: it &s;prung out of an ho&s;pital, <NOTE PLACE="marg">FREE SCHOOL.</NOTE> founded in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. by <HI>Laurence,</HI> prior of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and his convent, at the reque&s;t of <HI>Edmund,</HI> archdeacon of <HI>Coventry,</HI> for the reception of the &s;ick and needy.

who had large &s;hare in the plunder of the church, and having neither wife or child, converted this foundation, which he had purcha&s;ed at a very cheap rate, into a free &s;chool, and endowed it with CC marks a year in land.

On the out&s;ide was a paved road, in imitation of the military way from turret to turret on the famed wall of <HI>Severus:</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tour Scotl.</HI> vol. iii. 288.</NOTE> and be&s;ides, here were four others, which went a mile each way from the city.</P>
<P>AT a &s;mall di&s;tance without the <HI>Priory Gate,</HI> is <HI>Swan&s;well Pool,</HI> which &s;upplies the city with water. This did belong to the priory, but was at the di&s;&s;olution purcha&s;ed by the corporation from the crown <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugd. W.</HI> i. 146.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM hence I returned to the priory, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> &s;eated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the brook <HI>Sherburn.</HI> What bears that name is an uninhabited hou&s;e, of much later date than that mona&s;tery; but built on &s;ome part of the &s;ite of this great foundation.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 1043, earl <HI>Leofric</HI> and his fair counte&s;s more than repaired the lo&s;s in 1016, in the de&s;truction of the famous
<PB N="151" REF="169">
<HI>Saxon</HI> nunnery, by founding in its &s;tead a magnificent mona&s;tery. They placed here an abbot, and twenty-four monks of the <HI>Bene|dictine</HI> order; enriched the very walls and the church with ma&s;&s;y gold and &s;ilver, and endowed it with half the town and twenty-four manors. All this they did with the advice of king <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or and the reigning pope, and dedicated the church to the honor of God and his ble&s;&s;ed mother, St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>O&s;burg,</HI> and all &s;aints. The pious founders were buried, according to the cu&s;tom of the times, in the porches; for the di&s;ta&s;teful cu&s;tom of church interment did not prevale till long after.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t abbot was <HI>Leofrin;</HI> but that dignity was of &s;hort du|ration, for, on the removal of the &s;ee of <HI>Lichfield</HI> to this place, in 1095, by <HI>Robert de Limi&s;ie,</HI> the office was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the bi&s;hop being in &s;uch ca&s;es always e&s;teemed &s;upreme of the hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Willis's Abbeys,</HI> i. 70.</NOTE> in his &s;tead; a prior was appointed, but without derogating from the honor of the hou&s;e; for the priors were barons in parlement as well as the preceding abbots, and the place a mitred abbey. This fir&s;t prelate was more attracted by the wealth of the hou&s;e than by any &s;piritual call; for he at once &s;craped from a &s;ingle beam five hundred marks worth of &s;ilver, in order to carry on the intrigue at <HI>Rome</HI> again&s;t the poor monks. He reduced them to &s;uch &s;hort commons, that he depre&s;&s;ed their &s;pirits, di&s;couraged all &s;orts of knowlege among them, and, in &s;hort, rendered them too dejected to think of obtaining any redre&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS was a prelude to greater misfortunes. In the latter end of the following century, <HI>Hugh Novani,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> became bi&s;hop. He &s;oon fell at variance with the monks; who, in a &s;ynod held
<PB N="152" REF="170">
before the high altar, doubtle&s;s on &s;ome high provocation, broke his head with the holy cro&s;s.
<Q>Tantaene animis caele&s;tibus irae!</Q></P>
<P>This enraged the proud prelate (as he was called by tho&s;e meek monks) to lay his complaint again&s;t them at <HI>Rome.</HI> The pope attended to it, expelled the antient inhabitants, and placed in their room a &s;et of &s;ecular canons. The monks, now driven into the wild world, had only the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing their per|&s;ecutor &s;truck with deep remor&s;e; for, in 1198, lying on his death-bed, in the abbey of <HI>Bec,</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> he was &s;eized with fierce horrors at his conduct towards tho&s;e holy men; implored forgivene&s;s, and de&s;ired their interce&s;&s;ion with the Almighty in his behalf. He reque&s;ted to be buried in the habit of the order, that he might receive the benefit of its protection in the other world, and finally con&s;igned him&s;elf to purgatory, <HI>ibi in diem ju|dicii cruciandus.</HI></P>
<P>LUCKILY at the time of this event, <HI>Thomas,</HI> a monk of <HI>Coven|try,</HI> happened to be at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;oliciting the cau&s;e of his brethren: he &s;o enraged <HI>Innocent</HI> III. (then pope) by his importunities, as to order him to withdraw. The poor monk, with tears, replied, <Q>Another pope will come, to whom I &s;hall not &s;ue in vain. I therefore will patiently wait your death, as I have that of your two predece&s;&s;ors.</Q> "Here is a devil of a fellow" (&s;ays his Ho|line&s;s, in high wrath, to his attendants) <Q>by St. <HI>Peter!</HI> He &s;hall not wait for my death; &s;o I will not put him off any longer, but make out the purpo&s;e of his petition before I put a mor&s;el more into my mouth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale W.</HI> i. 161.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

THIS trouble&s;ome affair ended, they were replaced with double advantage; their privileges, as if by way of atonement for their &s;hort &s;ufferings, increa&s;ed beyond all rea&s;on; for in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> III. they obtained, that they and their tenants, except tho&s;e who held by knight &s;ervice more than half a knight's &s;ee, &s;hould be quit of murder, robbery, &s;uit to the county or hundred courts, aid to the &s;heriffs, view of frankpledge, and repair of the king's ca&s;tles or pools <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale,</HI> i. 161.</NOTE>.

<P>AMONG the &s;acred furniture was an image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> adorned with a chain of gold enriched with gems, be&s;towed by the Counte&s;s <HI>Godeva</HI> on her death-bed: to which the devotees were to &s;ay as many prayers as there were in it precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ides this, an arm of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> of <HI>Hippo,</HI> which <HI>Agelnethus,</HI> archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in 1020, bought at <HI>Rome</HI> from the pope, for the &s;mall &s;um of C talents of &s;ilver, and one of gold <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale W.</HI> i. 158. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> 78.</NOTE>.</P>

THE lo&s;s is the more to be regretted, as this cathedral is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been built on the model of that of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and equally beautiful. Nothing remains except a fragment, con&s;ti|tuting part of a private hou&s;e, to be &s;een with difficulty, and after &s;ome &s;earch.

The la&s;t prior, <HI>Thomas Cam&s;el,</HI> in 1538, was prevaled on to make a &s;urrender of the hou&s;e, either through fear of death, for with|&s;tanding the tyrant's plea&s;ure, or through lucre of pen&s;ion; for he had not le&s;s than &pound;133. 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> annuity, be&s;ides other al|lowances to the monks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stevens,</HI> i. 223. <HI>Willis's Abbeys,</HI> i. 72.</NOTE>.

IN king <HI>Stephen</HI>'s time, this church was a chapel to the monks; became afterwards a vicarage, and on the di&s;&s;olution fell to the gift of the crown. This, <HI>Trinity,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>'s, form the pa|ri&s;hes of this great city; &s;o numerous are the di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>ITS beautiful &s;teeple was begun in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. in 1372, by two brothers, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>William Bota,</HI> at their own charges, which amounted annually to one hundred pounds; nor was it fini&s;hed in le&s;s than twenty years.

<Q>At the time appointed, the king came to <HI>Coventrie,</HI> where the two dukes were readie, according to the order pre&s;cribed therein; comming thither in great arraie, accompanied with the lords and gentlemen of their linages. The king cau&s;ed a &s;umptuous &s;caffold, or theater, and roial li&s;tes there to be erected and prepared. The <HI>Sundaie</HI> before they &s;hould fight, after dinner, the duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> came to the king (being lodged about a quarter of a mile without the town, in a tower that belonged to Sir <HI>William Bagot</HI>) to take his leave of him. The morrow after, being the daie appointed for the combat, about the &s;pring of the daie came the duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> to the court, to take leave likewi&s;e of the king. The duke of <HI>Here|ford</HI> armed him in his tent, that was &s;et up neere to the li&s;ts; and the duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> put on his armor betwixt the gate and the barrier of the town, in a beautiful hou&s;e, having a fair perclois of wood towards the gate, that none might &s;ee what was done within the hou&s;e.</Q></P>

The con&s;table and mar&s;hal came to the barriers, demanding of him what he was? he an&s;wered,
<PB N="170" REF="190">
'I am <HI>Henrie</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> duke of <HI>Hereford:</HI> which am come hither to do mine indevor again&s;t <HI>Thomas Mowbraie</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> as a traitor untrue to God, the king, his realme, and me.'&mdash;Then incontinentlie he &s;ware upon the holie Evangeli&s;ts, that his quarrel was true &amp; ju&s;t; and upon that point he re|quired to enter the li&s;ts.

<P><Q>Soone after him entered into the field, with great triumph, King <HI>Richard,</HI> accompanied with all the peer&s;es of the realme; and in his companie was the earle of <HI>Saint Paule,</HI> which was come out of <HI>France,</HI> in po&s;t, to &s;ee this challenge performed. The king had there above ten thou&s;and men in armour, lea&s;t &s;ome fraie or tumult might ri&s;e among&s;t his nobles, by quar|relling or partaking.

<PB N="172" REF="192">
the heralds cried 'Silence;' and Sir <HI>John Bu&s;hie,</HI> the king's &s;ecretarie, read the &s;entence and determination of the king and his councell, in a long roll; the effect whereof was, that <HI>Henrie</HI> duke of <HI>Hereford</HI> &s;hould, within fifteene daies, depart out of the realme, and not to returne before the terme of ten yeares were expired, except by the king he &s;hould be repealed againe; and this upon paine of death: and that <HI>Thomas Mow|braie</HI> duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> bicau&s;e he had &s;owen &s;edition in the relme by his words, &s;hould likewi&s;e avoid the realme, and ne|ver returne againe into <HI>England,</HI> nor approch the borders or confines thereof, upon pain of death: and that the king would &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the profits of his lands, till he had levied thereof &s;uch &s;ummes of monie as the duke had taken up of the king's trea|&s;uror, for the wages of the garri&s;on of <HI>Calis;</HI> which were &s;till unpaid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When the&s;e judgements were once read, the king called be|fore him both parties, and made them to &s;weare that the one &s;hould never come in place where the other was, willinglie, nor keepe any companie togither in any forren region: which oth they both received humblie, and &s;o went their waies.

<P><HI>Combe Abbey,</HI> or, to &s;pell it with propriety, <HI>Cwm,</HI> from its low &s;ituation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">COMBE ABBEY.</NOTE> lies about two miles farther.

<P>THE de&s;ign was &s;peedily completed by various pious per&s;ons. <HI>Richard Luff,</HI> a mayor of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Richard Botoner,</HI> a fellow-citizen, be&s;towed four hundred marks on the church-choir, cloi&s;|ters,

he gave with her this county, and that of <HI>Huntingdon. Wal|theof</HI> unfortunately engaged in a con&s;piracy; and, notwith&s;tanding he repented, and flung him&s;elf at the king's mercy, was beheaded in 1074, at the in&s;tigation of his wife <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Order Vital.</HI></NOTE>. It &s;eems &s;he had ca&s;t a favorable eye on another per&s;on: but was di&s;appointed; for the king offered to her <HI>Simon de Liz,</HI> a noble <HI>Norman,</HI> lame of one leg: him &s;he rejected; which &s;o enraged her uncle, that he de|prived her of the two earldoms, and gave them to <HI>De Liz,</HI> with her elde&s;t daughter; which obliged <HI>Judith</HI> to a &s;tate of peniten|tial widowhood during life.</P>
<P>HERE are &s;ome remains of the priory, <NOTE PLACE="marg">PRIORY.</NOTE> inhabited by poor fami|lies. The place is ea&s;ily di&s;covered, by &s;everal gothic windows, and a door acce&s;&s;ible by a great flight of &s;teps.

<P>FROM <HI>Daventry</HI> I vi&s;ited the noted camps on <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">BOROUGH-HILL.</NOTE> or <HI>Danes-hill,</HI> about a mile &s;outh-ea&s;t of the town. It is lofty and in&s;ulated. The area is of an oblong or oval form, about a mea|&s;ured mile in length, and near two in circumference. The whole is &s;urrounded by two, three, or four deep trenches, and the &s;ame number of great ramparts, or banks; according as the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the ground required. The&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="209">
run on the margin of the hill, and on the &s;lope; and hav|ing the entrance on the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;ides oppo&s;ite to each other.</P>
<P>WITHIN the area, near the middle, is a bank, which pa&s;&s;es &s;trait from the we&s;tern &s;ide towards the ea&s;tern: the remainder is de&s;troyed. Farther on is the ve&s;tige of another, running paral|lel. The&s;e, when entire, would have formed a rectangular camp, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of part of the ditches on the &s;ides of the hill.</P>
<P>NEAR this camp are &s;everal <HI>tumuli</HI> of the &s;epulchral kind; but &s;ince Mr. <HI>Morton</HI>'s time, their number is evidently le&s;&s;ened; for in his days, he informs us, there were eighteen.</P>
<P>THE northern end of the hill is formed into a third camp, of a circular &s;hape, and of va&s;t &s;trength. Two ditches, of prodigious depth, with &s;uitable ramparts, and a deep entrance, cro&s;s the area, and fall into the general &s;urrounding ditches, which have been deepened to add to the &s;trength of the third part. There is like|wi&s;e the imperfect remains of another ditch and bank on the out|&s;ide, a little &s;outh, de&s;igned to add to the &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>ON the north-we&s;t part of the great rampart of this round camp, is a great mount, either exploratory, or the &s;pot where the chieftain pitched his tent.</P>
<P>I MUST differ with Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> about the makers of the fir&s;t of the&s;e camps or po&s;ts, which were the <HI>Britons</HI> them&s;elves. It has every agreement with the multitudes of others &s;cattered over the kingdom, and &s;uits exactly with the de&s;cription left by <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the method of defence u&s;ed by our ance&s;tors, <HI>Tunc montibus arduis, et &s;i qua clementer accedi poterunt in modum valli &s;axa prae&s;truit.</HI> I

<P>THIS po&s;t was in all probability made u&s;e of when the victo|rious <HI>O&s;torius</HI> was traver&s;ing this i&s;land, to quell the commotions he found on his arrival in <HI>Britain.</HI> It is evident, that the <HI>Britons</HI> at this period made u&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies of defence which is proved to have been common to the whole country. The <HI>Iceni</HI> lodged them&s;elves within a po&s;t of this kind, again&s;t this very general <HI>(Locum pugnae delegere &s;eptum agre&s;ti aggere et aditu angu&s;|to ne pervius equis foret)</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Taciti Annal.</HI> lib. xii. c. 31.</NOTE> but it did not avale. The <HI>Coritani</HI> of the&s;e parts had recour&s;e to the &s;trong hold of what I dare &s;ay they called <HI>Ben Avon,</HI> or the head over the river; one of the &s;treams which form the <HI>Nen,</HI> the river of this country, pa&s;&s;ing be|neath.</P>
<P>THIS po&s;t proved no ob&s;tacle to the Conqueror; he found it &s;it for a &s;tation: he contracted its limits ea&s;t into the &s;hape of the camps of his people, and made this a &s;ummer &s;tation, as he did the warm bottom, near the fort, a winter &s;tation. Numbers of <HI>Roman</HI> coins found on the &s;pots, evince the conjecture. The <HI>Romans,</HI> as is frequently the ca&s;e, latinized the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> name, and formed from it their <HI>Benvenna;</HI> which I beg leave to place here, rather than at <HI>Wedon,</HI> a place de&s;titute of all cla&s;&s;ical traces.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Borough-hill,</HI> about two or three hundred yards below the ditches, is a le&s;&s;er camp, &s;urrounded by a fo&s;s and bank. Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> gue&s;&s;es it to have
<PB N="191" REF="211">
been the receptacle of the carriages of the greater camp: I ima|gine it to have been a <HI>proce&s;tria,</HI> a &s;ort of free po&s;t attendant often on camps, where provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries were brought.</P>
<P>As to the third divi&s;ion of the area of this hill, it is probably <HI>Saxon;</HI> the words <HI>borough, burgh, berry,</HI> and <HI>bury,</HI> being the con&s;tant appellation left by the <HI>Saxons</HI> to &s;imilar places. It is my belief, that every po&s;t of this nature, occupied by that nation in our i&s;land, had been originally <HI>Briti&s;h;</HI> which they altered to their conceptions of &s;trength and defence; which was u&s;ually done by deepening the ditches, rai&s;ing the ramparts, and clearing the area, and often exalting one part into what was called the <HI>dunjeon,</HI> or keep. The&s;e places were &s;tationary, not properly camps; for the antient <HI>Germans,</HI> from whom the&s;e invaders were derived, and who&s;e cu&s;|toms they retained, made u&s;e of no other defence to their camps than a barrier of waggons, with which they formed the precinct. <HI>Omnes Barbari,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Vegetius, carris &s;uis in orbem connexis ad &s;imili|tudinem ca&s;trorum &s;ecuras a &s;upervenientibus exigunt noctes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. c. 10.</NOTE>.

<P>EVERY thing on this hill mu&s;t not be attributed to remote an|tiquity; for <HI>Charles</HI> I. a few days before the fatal battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> occupied this po&s;t, and fortified it: &s;o po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of the entrenchments might be the work of the unfortunate mo|narch <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock,</HI> 150.</NOTE>.</P>

Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> makes a mo&s;t finical appearance: his habit elegant: has on a &s;a&s;h, a hat with a white feather, laced turnover, a long love-lock extended on his left arm, an ear-ring in one ear, a &s;pear in the other, and brown boots. Thus he is repre&s;ented as a &s;mart office-clerk, walking in his new-acquired park; for he was clerk of the privy council to two kings: and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Gorhambury</HI> from his ma&s;ter, who conveyed it to him on fore&s;eeing his fall. Like a grateful &s;ervant, <HI>Meautys</HI> erected a hand&s;ome monument to him in a neighboring church, more to &s;hew his re&s;pect, than from any nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to pre&s;erve the memory of one &s;elf-immortalized.</P>

On the picture is this motto, <HI>Nec pudet vivere, nec piget mori.</HI> This gentleman was one of tho&s;e worthy per&s;ons who &s;et out with a view of reforming the abu&s;es of the arbitrary court of <HI>Charles</HI> I. but who&s;e moderation and good &s;en&s;e made them op|po&s;e their own party, when it attempted mea&s;ures &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution: in con&s;equence, he, with &s;everal others, were excluded the hou&s;e. In 1656, he was elected one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s parlement; but not being approved by the &s;lavi&s;h council of the u&s;urper, was laid a&s;ide.

He was con&s;tantly a mediating commi&s;&s;ioner in all treaties on the &s;ide of the parlement; in which he behaved with dignity, &s;pirit, and integrity. He was appointed governor of the king's children while they were &s;eparated from him, and behaved to them with re&s;pect and affection. He joined with op|po&s;ing the ordonnance for the trial of his ma&s;ter; and, after his death, retired to <HI>Petworth,</HI> and took no part with the u&s;urping powers. He joined heartily in the Re&s;toration; but, like a true friend to his country, wi&s;hed for it on terms of &s;ecurity to the people, and advantage for the nation. He received from the re|&s;tored king honors &s;uited to his rank, and enjoyed them till his death, in 1668.</P>

<P>THIS beautiful tomb was once in&s;ulated, as appears by one of the&s;e <HI>items.</HI> In the middle is a pervious arch, adorned above with the coat of arms of the decea&s;ed; and others again along a freeze; with his &s;upporters, two antelopes with collars. From the freeze ari&s;es a light elegant tabernacle-work, with niches; containing on one &s;ide the effigies of our princes; the other &s;ide is de&s;poiled of the figures.</P>
<P>IN 1703, the vault in which repo&s;ed the remains of this illu&s;|trious per&s;onage was di&s;covered. The body was pre&s;erved in a
<PB N="268" REF="299">
leaden coffin, in a &s;trong pickle; and over that was another ca&s;e, of wood, now peri&s;hed. Again&s;t the wall is painted a Crucifixion, with four chalices receiving the blood; a hand pointing towards it, with a label, in&s;cribed <HI>Lord have mercy upon me.</HI></P>

<P>ABBOT <HI>Whetham&s;ted</HI>'s, <NOTE PLACE="marg">WHETHAMSTED'S CHAPEEL.</NOTE> tomb (or <HI>Johannes de loco frumentario,</HI> as he &s;tiled him&s;elf) is covered by a &s;mall chapel, erected by him|&s;elf. It is a plain building, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the choir. His arms, allu&s;ive to his name, are three ears of wheat; and the motto, allu&s;ive to the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the mona&s;tery under his government, is <HI>Valles abundabunt,</HI> twice repeated. <HI>Weever,</HI> from p. 562 to 567, enumerates all his munificent works. He had a great turn towards ornamental genero&s;ity; and cau&s;ed this church, the Lady's chapel, and &s;everal parts of the hou&s;e, to be adorned with hi&s;torical paintings, and in&s;criptions of his own compo&s;ition to be placed under them. He al&s;o was a great
<PB N="269" REF="300">
compo&s;er of epitaphs. The reader will accept, as a &s;pecimen of the fir&s;t, a di&s;tich placed in our Lady's chapel:

<P>His arti&s;t was <HI>Alan Strayler,</HI> painter; <NOTE PLACE="marg">STRAYLER, THE PAINTER.</NOTE> who is &s;aid to have been &s;o well paid for his work, that he forgave the convent three &s;hil|lings and four pence of an old debt, for colors; and on that ac|count was probably complimented with the following epitaph:

<P>I BELIEVE, &s;ome of his labors are yet extant in the roof of the choir; on which is painted, in compartments, an Eagle and a Lamb. Under others, in our Lady's chapel, was this line:

<P>IN the middle of the cieling of the north aile, is a painting of the martyrdom of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> (as is &s;aid) over the very &s;pot on which he &s;uffered. There is, be&s;ides, a rude &s;culpture of his death in a &s;mall aile on the back of his chapel, expre&s;&s;ing the manner how the executioner lo&s;t his eyes for his impiety.</P>
<P>IN the center of another cieling, is a rude painting of king <HI>Offa;</HI> and this in&s;cription beneath:
<Q><L>Fundator eccle&s;iae circa annum 793</L>

<P>THE town of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> is large, and, in general, <NOTE PLACE="marg">TOWN.</NOTE> filled with antient buildings. It originally &s;prung from a few hou&s;es built by king <HI>Offa,</HI> for the conveniency of the officers and &s;ervants of the mona&s;tery. About the year 950, it was &s;o increa&s;ed, that king <HI>Ethelred,</HI> at the interce&s;&s;ion of abbot <HI>Ulfin,</HI> gave it a grant of a market, and the rank of a borough. In the <HI>Doom&s;day Book,</HI> it appears at the Conque&s;t to have been rated for ten hides. The <Q>arable was &s;ixteen ploughlands. In deme&s;ne, three hides, two ploughlands, and another may be made. There were four aliens, &s;ixteen villeyns, and thirteen boors, having thirteen ploughlands: forty-&s;ix burge&s;&s;es: the toll, and other rents of the town, eleven pounds fourteen &s;hillings a year: three mills, forty &s;hillings a year: meadow, two ploughlands in quantity: wood to feed a thou&s;and hogs in pannage-time: and &s;even &s;hillings rent. The total twenty pounds at that time; in that of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, twenty-four. There are now twelve cottagers, a park of deer, and a fi&s;h-pond.</Q></P>
<P>THE town was always con&s;idered as part of the deme&s;ne of the abbey; and at the Conque&s;t it was part of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="276" REF="307">
<HI>Richard</HI> I. by charter, confirmed it to them, with a market, and all the liberty attending a borough: the abbot holding, as he al|leged, of the king <HI>in capite,</HI> and holding the burge&s;&s;es as de|me&s;ned men of the abbey. This tenure the burge&s;&s;es wi&s;hed to force from him; which they attempted by the following &s;tratagem: &mdash;In the thirty-fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> I. they had &s;ent repre&s;entatives to parlement, and al&s;o in the fir&s;t and &s;econd of <HI>Edward</HI> II; but in the fifth of the &s;ame reign, the &s;heriff of <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> by the con|trivance of the abbot, to &s;ave the expence, had omitted the u&s;ual &s;ummons. This the burge&s;&s;es complained of, a&s;&s;erting that they held of the king; hoping thereby to get relea&s;ed of the &s;ervices they owed their lord abbot: or, if they &s;ucceeded in &s;ending members, to be freed of tho&s;e which they owed the king. Both of which expectations, in the opinion of Mr. <HI>Madox,</HI> were ill|founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiquities of the Exchequer,</HI> i. 760.</NOTE>. Burge&s;&s;es were returned to parlement the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and in the &s;econd, fourth, and fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> III; after which the load, or the privilege, as it was re&s;pectively thought by the di&s;putants, cea&s;ed. At the time of the di&s;&s;olu|tion, the town, with the other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the abbey, fell to the king <HI>(Henry</HI> VIII.) and from him to his heir, <HI>Edward</HI> VI; who, by letters patent, dated <HI>May</HI> 12th, 1553, <NOTE PLACE="marg">INCORPARATED</NOTE> made the town of <HI>St. Alban's</HI> a body corporate, by the name of the mayor and bur|ge&s;&s;es, and granted to the &s;aid mayor and burge&s;&s;es, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the &s;aid profits, and other franchi&s;es; they to hold the premi&s;es in free burgage, and to render yearly to the crown XL. as a fee-farm, at the fea&s;t of St. <HI>Michael</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Madox,</HI> i. 762.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE remarkable events, which befel this town in earlier times, were, as u&s;ual, of the &s;anguinary kind. During the rage of the barons wars, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. the burge&s;&s;es fortified the place, and defended it with &s;trong gates, well &s;ecured. They were particularly jealous of hor&s;emen; therefore refu&s;ed pa&s;&s;age to all cavaliers. The con&s;table of <HI>Hertford,</HI> di&s;plea&s;ed at this prohibition, in a bravado, boa&s;ted that he would enter the town with three youths (knights) and four of his be&s;t villeins. He did &s;o; and, walking up and down with great in&s;olence, a&s;ked his companions which way the wind was. The town&s;men, alarmed at the que&s;tion, thought he de&s;igned to fire their hou&s;es. In a &s;um|mary way they executed ju&s;tice, by knocking down and beheading him, his youths, and villeins; placing their heads on poles, at the corners of their &s;treets. The king re&s;ented this inva&s;ion of his prerogative, and fined the town in a hundred marks; which was immediately paid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chauney,</HI> 442.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. they underwent a mortification of a far heavier nature. In 1381, after the bloody in&s;urrection of <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> a court of ju&s;tice was held here, by the famous Sir <HI>Robert Tre&s;ilian. John Ball,</HI> a prie&s;t of <HI>Coventry,</HI> was tried and executed. Several of the inhabitants had favored the rebels, or, taking advantage of the turbulence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mes, had de|manded
<PB N="278" REF="309">
from the abbot a relea&s;e from all their &s;ervices. Several of them were condemned and put to death, and orders given, that their bodies &s;hould remain on the gallows <HI>in terrorem.</HI> The bur|ge&s;&s;es, in contempt of the king, took them down; but when a di&s;covery was made, <HI>Richard,</HI> in a rage, commanded the town&s;|men to make chains, and hang the putrid carca&s;es on the &s;ame places they took them from; which, di&s;gu&s;ting and horrible as the ta&s;k was, they were obliged to perform<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Holin&s;hed,</HI> 438.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the civil wars between the hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRST BATTLE AT ST. ALBAN'S.</NOTE> this town was the &s;cene of dreadful carnage. Here was &s;hed the fir&s;t blood in that fatal quarrel. As &s;oon as ever the weak <HI>Henry,</HI> or rather his queen and mini&s;ters, found them&s;elves free from the power of his rival the duke of <HI>York,</HI> they armed their forces, and marched from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to meet their enemy, who was advancing towards them with a mighty ho&s;t. They met on the 22d of <HI>May,</HI> 1455. The peaceful prince &s;ent out a herald to <HI>York,</HI> &s;trictly commanding him to keep the peace as became a dutiful &s;ubject, and to avoid effu&s;ion of blood. <HI>York</HI>'s an&s;wer was humble, yet re&s;olute; demanding the duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and other delinquents, to be delivered into his hands, that ju&s;tice might be executed on them, for the mi&s;eries they had brought on the realm. <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> who had been regent of <HI>France,</HI> was charged in particular with the lo&s;s of <HI>Normandy.</HI> The king determined to &s;tand the event of the day, rather than give up his friends. His banner was placed in St. <HI>Peter's &s;treet.</HI> Orders were i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Henry</HI> (but mo&s;t probably by the bloody <HI>Margaret</HI>) that no quar|ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stow,</HI> 399.</NOTE>

&s;hould be given to his opponents. The <HI>Yorki&s;ts</HI> began the attack in three places. The famous <HI>John</HI> lord <HI>Clifford</HI> defended the barriers with his accu&s;tomed valour.

The duke of <HI>York</HI> entered at the &s;ame time, and a dreadful fight en&s;ued. Victory declared in his favor. Numbers of the nobility and gentry, with about eight hundred common men, fell on the &s;ide of <HI>Henry:</HI> the valiant <HI>Clifford,</HI> u&s;ually called <HI>The Old,</HI> though only forty years of age; the earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> &s;on to the noted <HI>Hot&s;pur;</HI> and the great duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> were &s;lain.

<P>Numbers of the nobility were wounded, and numbers fled till the fury of the battle was over. None were executed by the vic|tor: the barbarity of civil feuds had not yet taken place, pro|voked by the reciprocal cruelties which &s;peedily followed.</P>
<P><HI>Henry,</HI> wounded in the neck by an arrow, which hurtled in &s;howers on him, retreated to a poor cottage, where he was found by the conquerors. They a&s;ked forgivene&s;s on their knees; which the humane prince readily gave, on condition they would &s;top

<P>THE king, from this time to the year 1461, remained a mere &s;hadow of royalty, entirely under the directions of the <HI>Yorki&s;ts,</HI> His queen was driven from him, under the terror of a pro&s;cription. That &s;pirited woman did not employ her time in prayers, or counting her beads, like her weak hu&s;band; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her northern friends, rai&s;ed a potent army, fought and &s;lew the duke of <HI>York</HI> at the battle of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> on <HI>December</HI> 30th, 1460; and, marching towards <HI>London,</HI> gave occa&s;ion to a &s;econd battle at <HI>St. Alban's.</HI></P>

day: he quitted the field, and left a complete victory to the queen.

They fought ob&s;cured in fog till ten o'clock: victory &s;eemed to incline to <HI>Warwick;</HI> when his people, mi&s;taking the &s;tars in the helms of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s &s;oldiers, for the &s;uns of

The mar|quis of <HI>Montacute,</HI> with the ficklene&s;s u&s;ual in tho&s;e times, had privily agreed with <HI>Edward</HI> to de&s;ert his brother <HI>War|wick,</HI> and had changed his livery. This was di&s;covered by &s;ome of the earl's men; who in&s;tantly put him to death: a fit reward of fraternal perfidy! <HI>Warwick,</HI> &s;eeing his brother &s;lain, <HI>Oxford</HI> fled, and the fortune of the day turned again&s;t him, leaped on a hor&s;e, in hopes of e&s;caping; but coming to an im|pa&s;&s;able wood, was there killed, and &s;tripped naked; and, after being expo&s;ed, with the body of <HI>Montacute,</HI> for three or four days, in the church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, was interred in the abbey of <HI>Bi&s;ham</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> founded by the <HI>Montacutes,</HI> his maternal ance&s;tors. About four thou&s;and were &s;lain on both &s;ides; who were interred for the mo&s;t part on the &s;pot. <HI>Edward</HI> built here a chapel, and, according to the cu&s;tom of the times, appointed a prie&s;t to &s;ay ma&s;s for the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed.

<HI>Northampton</HI> is owing to the calamity it &s;u&s;tained by fire, on <HI>Sep|tember</HI> 20th, 1675; when the greate&s;t part was laid in a&s;hes. The hou&s;es were at that time chiefly wooden. Twenty-five thou&s;and pounds were collected by briefs and private charity towards its relief; and the king gave a thou&s;and tons of timber, out of <HI>Whit|tlewood</HI> fore&s;t, and remitted the duty of chimney-money in this town for &s;even years: &s;o that it was &s;oon rebuilt; and changed its wooden edifices for more &s;ecure and ornamental hou&s;es of &s;tone.</P>
<P>THE church of <HI>All Saints</HI> fell a victim to the flames. The old church was a large pile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCHES.</NOTE> with a tower in the center. It was re|built with great magnificence, and is a con&s;iderable ornament to this pretty town. The portico is very elegant, &s;upported in front by eight columns of the Ionic order. The body &s;tands on four lofty columns, and has a neat dome in the middle. The roof beautifully &s;tuccoed. This church, and that of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> were be|&s;towed on the priory of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> by <HI>Simon de St. Liz,</HI> the founder. <HI>All Saints</HI> is at pre&s;ent in the gift of the members of the corporation, who are inhabitants of the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>THE church of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the Knights Templars, on the model of that at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem.</HI> The imitative part is round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HOLY SEPULCHRE.</NOTE> with a nave i&s;&s;uing from it.

The &s;pace from the wall to the pillars is eleven feet: the diameter, from the in&s;ide of one pillar to that of the oppo&s;ite, is twenty-nine feet two inches.

<P>THE county hall is a very hand&s;ome building,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COUNTY HALL.</NOTE> and ornamented in the manner which gives dignity to courts of ju&s;tice.

<P>ABOUT five miles from <HI>Queen's Cro&s;s</HI> I turned a little out of my road, to &s;ee <HI>Horton</HI> church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORTON CHURCH.</NOTE> remarkable for a fine monument of <HI>William</HI> lord <HI>Parr,</HI> uncle, to <HI>Catherine,</HI> the la&s;t queen to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.

His upper lip is bare, but his beard is enormous, regularly curled in two rows. He was called to the Hou&s;e of Peers on this &s;econd marriage of his niece, was appointed her chamberlain, and, during the queen's regency, on the king's expedition to <HI>France</HI> in 1544, had the re|&s;pect &s;hewn him to be named as a council to her maje&s;ty, occa|&s;ionally to be called in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herbert's Henry VIII.</HI> 577.</NOTE>.

<P>ON the floor are the figures of <HI>Roger Salu&s;bury,</HI> between his two wives, in bra&s;s. He died in 1482, fir&s;t owner, of his name, of this e&s;tate; who&s;e grandaughter became mi&s;tre&s;s of it on the death of her father <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Lanes</HI> kept it for &s;ome generations. On the death of Sir <HI>William,</HI> it was found to be held of Sir <HI>Richard Chetwood,</HI> as of his manor of <HI>Woodhall,</HI> by the &s;ervice of one knight's &s;ee, &s;uit of court, and the annual payment of 6<HI>s.</HI> towards the guard of <HI>Rockingham</HI> ca&s;tle.

She had not been married three years, before her hu&s;band was &s;natched from her by an ignominious and merited death, for his deep concern in the plot, which, thanks to the charity of the times, is execrated by each religion.

<P>I NOW return to the period when the family emerged from its misfortune; and in the per&s;on of Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> the &s;on of the la&s;t Sir <HI>Evarard,</HI> was re&s;tored to its former honor, by the uncommon merits of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He married <HI>Venetia,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Stanley</HI> of <HI>Tongue Ca&s;tle, Shrop&s;hire,</HI> Knight of the Bath. His elde&s;t &s;on, <HI>Kenelm,</HI> was &s;lain in 1648, in the civil wars, at <HI>St. Neots:</HI> his &s;econd &s;on, <HI>John,</HI> &s;ucceeded to the e&s;tate, and &s;ur|vived

his father many years. He left by his wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Longueville</HI> of <HI>Wolverton,</HI> in this county, Baronet, two daughters; the elde&s;t, <HI>Margaret Maria,</HI> married Sir <HI>John Conway</HI> of <HI>Boddruddan,</HI> in <HI>Flint&s;hire;</HI> the younger, <HI>Char|lotta,</HI> married <HI>Richard Mo&s;tyn</HI> of <HI>Penbedw,</HI> in the &s;ame county, E&s;quire. The&s;e two gentlemen, in 1704, &s;old this manor, with <HI>Stoke Goldington,</HI> and the advow&s;on of both the churches, to <HI>George Wright,</HI> E&s;quire, &s;on of the lord keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright;</HI> in who&s;e po&s;terity it &s;till remains.

<P>SOME portraits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> belonging to the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, &s;till keep a place in the hou&s;e.

He &s;tands by her, with averted look, one hand on his brea&s;t, and with an air which &s;hews his rejection of her addre&s;&s;es, and horror at the infamy of merce|nary love; and as if uttering to her the words in&s;cribed near to him, <HI>his majora</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This portrait is in&s;cribed on the back <HI>John Digby;</HI> but from the romantic circum&s;tance attending it, the dre&s;s, and the likene&s;s to other pictures of Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> I cannot help &s;uppo&s;ing it to be his.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS is a portrait of the famous Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> in his youthful days; that prodigy of learning, credulity, valour, and romance, who&s;e merits, although mixed with many foibles, entirely oblite|rated every attention to the memory of his father's infamy. The circum&s;tance of the lady painted along with him, is a &s;trong con|firmation of the truth of the &s;tory related by <HI>Lloyd,</HI> that an <HI>Italian</HI> prince, who was childle&s;s, earne&s;tly wi&s;hed that his prince&s;s might become a mother by Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> whom he e&s;teemed as a ju&s;t mo|del of perfection. It is probable that the prince&s;s would not have di&s;obeyed the commands of her lord: but whether the painting alludes to our knight's cruelty on this occa&s;ion, or whether it might not de&s;cribe the adventure of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> lady, recorded in an elegant old ballad<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antient Songs and Ballads,</HI> ii. 231.</NOTE>, I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>IN the long room above &s;tairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LADY VENETIA.</NOTE> is the picture of his beloved wife <HI>Venetia Ana&s;tatia Stanley,</HI> in a <HI>Roman</HI> habit, with curled locks. In one hand is a &s;erpent; the other is on a pair of white doves.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="371">
She is painted at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> in the &s;ame emblematic manner, but in a different dre&s;s, and with accompaniments explanatory of the emblems. The doves &s;hew her innocency; the &s;erpent, which &s;he handles with impunity, &s;hews her triumph over the enve|nomed tongues of the times. We know not the particulars of the &s;tory. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> mu&s;t allude to her exculpation of the charge, what&s;oever it was, when he mentions her as <Q>a lady of an extraordinary beauty, of as extraordinary &s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord Clarendon's Life,</HI> 34.</NOTE>.</Q> In the &s;ame picture is a genius about to place a wreath on her head. Beneath her is a Cupid, pro&s;trate: and behind him is Calumny, with two faces, flung down and bound; a beautiful compliment on her victory over Malevolence. Her hair in this picture is light, and differs in color from that in the other. I have heard, from a de&s;cendant of her's, that &s;he affected different hair-dre&s;&s;es, and different-colored eye-brows, to &s;ee which be&s;t became her.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Kenelm</HI> was &s;o enamoured with her beauty, that he was &s;aid to have attempted to exalt her charms, and pre&s;erve her health, by a variety of whim&s;ical experiments. Among others, that of feed|ing her with capons fed with the fle&s;h of vipers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am told, that the great &s;nail, or <HI>Pomatia, (Br. Zool.</HI> iv. N^o 128) is found in the neighboring woods, which is its mo&s;t &s;outhern re&s;idence in this i&s;land. It is of exotic origin. Tradition &s;ays, it was introduced by Sir <HI>Kenelm,</HI> as a medicine for the u&s;e of his lady.</NOTE>; and that, to improve her complexion, he was perpetually inventing new co&s;|metics. Probably &s;he fell a victim to the&s;e arts; for &s;he was found dead in bed, <HI>May</HI> 1&s;t, 1633, in the thirty-third year of her age. She was buried in <HI>Chri&s;tchurch, London,</HI> under a large in&s;u|lated

tomb of black marble, with her bu&s;t on the top. This pe|ri&s;hed in the great fire; but the form is repre&s;ented in the <HI>Pedigree-book,</HI> and from that engraven in the <HI>Antiquaries Reper|tory.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH the pictures are the performances of <HI>Vandyck.</HI> In this at <HI>Gothur&s;t</HI> are two of her &s;ons, of a boyi&s;h age, and in the dre&s;s of the times.</P>
<P>HERE are, be&s;ides, two mo&s;t beautiful bu&s;ts of the &s;ame lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUSTS OF LADY VENETIA.</NOTE> in bra&s;s; whether by <HI>Le Soeur</HI> or <HI>Fanelli,</HI> I am not certain. One is in the dre&s;s of the times: an elegant laced handkerchief falls over her &s;houlders, leaving her neck bare. Her hair is curled, braided, twi&s;ted, and formed on the hind part of her head into a circle; beneath which fall elegant locks. On this bu&s;t is in|&s;cribed,
<Q><HI>Uxorem vivam amare voluptas, defunctam, religio.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE other is <HI>a l'antique.</HI> The head is dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame man|ner, only bound in a fillet: the drapery covers her brea&s;t; but &s;o artificially, as not to de&s;troy the elegancy of the form.</P>
<P>I KNOW of no per&s;ons who are painted in greater variety of forms and places, than this illu&s;trious pair: po&s;&s;ibly becau&s;e they were the fine&s;t &s;ubjects of the times. Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal mo&s;t exqui&s;ite miniatures of the lady, by <HI>Oliver,</HI> bought from the heirs of <HI>Boddrudan</HI> and <HI>Pembedw,</HI> at a very high price. The mo&s;t valuable is one in a gold ca&s;e, where &s;he is painted in company with her hu&s;band. There is another, &s;aid to be painted after &s;he was dead; and four others, in water-colors.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame gentleman is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a beautiful miniature
<PB N="338" REF="374">
of her mother, lady <HI>Lucy Percy,</HI> purcha&s;ed at the &s;ame time. She is dre&s;&s;ed like a citizen's wife, and with dark hair.</P>
<P>AMONG other portraits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LORD KEEPER WRIGHT.</NOTE> is a full-length of the lord keeper, Sir <HI>Nathan Wright,</HI> in his robes, and a head of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jekyll,</HI> with a long wig and robes. The fir&s;t received his appointment in the year 1700, unfortunately for him, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to lord <HI>Somers;</HI> who&s;e precipitate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, in favor of a Tory, hardly allowed time for reflection on the impropriety of the choice. Sir <HI>Nathan</HI> kept his place till the year 1703, when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, not without di&s;grace; more through defect of ability than want of integrity: but contemned by both parties.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was a very different character: a &s;taunch Whig, and a man of great abilities and worth. He died Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, in 1738. His wig was probably none of the be&s;t, if we are to tru&s;t the&s;e complimentary lines of <HI>Pope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epilogue to the Satires.</HI></NOTE>:

<P>THE church is at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHURCH.</NOTE> is new, and very neat, having been rebuilt, in pur&s;uance of the will of <HI>George Wright,</HI> E&s;quire, &s;on of the keeper.

<P>FROM <HI>Gothur&s;t</HI> I cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ouze,</HI> to the re&s;pectable old hou&s;e of <HI>Tyringham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TYRINGHAM.</NOTE> (once the &s;eat of a family of the &s;ame name) which &s;tands very high in point of antiquity. <HI>Giffard de Tyringham</HI> gave the church of <HI>Tyringham</HI> to the priory of <HI>Tickford,</HI> near <HI>Newport Pagnel,</HI> in 1187. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was one of the knights who attended <HI>Edward</HI> I. into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and <HI>Roger,</HI> his &s;on, was &s;heriff of this county as early as the fifteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> II<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1322, or the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> II. <HI>Roger de Tyringham</HI> was appointed to &s;uperintend the e&s;tates forfeited in this county, on the earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI>'s rebel|lion. <HI>Rymer,</HI> iii. 963.</NOTE>. A Sir <HI>John Tyring|ham</HI> had the honor of lo&s;ing his head in the cau&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> VI; being, with &s;everal others, put to death unheard, in 1461, for the murder of the duke of <HI>York;</HI> that is, for being pre&s;ent at the battle of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> where that prince fell by &s;ome unknown hand. It continued in this antient family till 1685, when, on the death of Sir <HI>William Tyringham,</HI> it devolved to <HI>John,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Edward Backwell,</HI> alderman of <HI>London,</HI> who had married his only daughter.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e has been neglected for &s;ome time, but not wholly unfurni&s;hed. Several family-portraits &s;till continue there: &s;uch as a head of lady <HI>Tyringham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTRAITS.</NOTE> in a yellow laced cap and ruff, of

<P>A VERY curious picture, full-length, of an aged lady, in a great quilled ruff and gauze cap, di&s;tended behind, with an enor|mous gauze veil falling to the ground; a black gown &s;potted with white; jewels, in form of a cro&s;s, on her brea&s;t; another on her arm, and great &s;trings of pearl round her wri&s;ts. She &s;tands beneath a canopy, on which is a crown and coat of arms.</P>

<P>A SMALL portrait of <HI>Edward Backwell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">EDW. BACKWELL.</NOTE> E&s;quire. He is repre|&s;ented in long hair and a flowered gown, with a table by him. I have a fine print of him, given me by the late Mr. <HI>Backwell,</HI> one of his de&s;cendants. He was, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Granger,</HI> an alderman of <HI>London</HI> and a banker, of great ability, indu&s;try, and integrity, and of mo&s;t exten&s;ive credit; but ruined in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. by the infamous project of &s;hutting up the Exchequer. He retired to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he died, and was brought over to be interred in the church of <HI>Tyringham;</HI> where he lies embalmed. A gla&s;s is placed over his face; &s;o his vi&s;age may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;een to this time.</P>
<P>I COULD not but admire a &s;pirited picture of a Falcon &s;tooping at Bitterns.</P>
<P>IN the hall is a curious table, of an a&s;h-colored marble. I &s;hould call it a polyne&s;ious marble, being veined like a chart filled with little i&s;lands, nicely &s;haded at their edges.</P>

<P>THE la&s;t abbot, <HI>Robert Hobbs,</HI> was hanged at <HI>Woburn,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1537, for not acknowleging the king's &s;upremacy.

No one profited &s;o greatly by the plunder of the church as this family: the fortune, even to the pre&s;ent time, doth principally originate from gifts of this nature.

<P><Q>LORD, let me under&s;tand the rea&s;on of the&s;e dark and wounding providences, that I &s;ink not under the di&s;courage|ment of my own thoughts.

Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> the lady in que&s;tion, became queen to <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in 1536, and was relea&s;ed from him by death, 1537. The portrait expre&s;&s;es the elegance of her per&s;on.

Her black conic cap is faced with gold and jewels. A rich chain of great pearls and &s;mall va&s;es, red and gold, are other ornaments to our bigotted &s;overeign. The date is 1553.

What is &s;ingular in this monument is, the pre&s;ervation of the very ball with which he was killed, a five or &s;ix pounder; which is placed within the pe|diment, inlaid in the marble; and on the molding of the pedi|ment, on each &s;ide of the bullet, are the words,

<P>FROM the town I de&s;cended to <HI>Ampthill Park,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AMPTHILL PARK.</NOTE> the &s;eat of the earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory:</HI> a modern hou&s;e, plain and neat, with eleven win|dows in front, and wings.

She accepted the terms, and erected the <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;tandard in her capital; and, on her arrival at <HI>Venice,</HI> was met by the whole &s;enate, and the ladies of rank, and received, during life, every mark of e&s;teem which her patrioti&s;m merited; with a magnificent e&s;tabli&s;hment, equal to the dignity &s;he had &s;o generou&s;ly quitted.

<P><HI>Albert</HI> archduke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Cardinal In|fant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CARDINAL INFANT.</NOTE> in black, a great ruff, and with a &s;word.

<P><HI>Ampthill Park,</HI> and that of <HI>Houghton,</HI> contiguous to it, were granted by <HI>James</HI> I. to Sir <HI>Edward Bruce</HI> of <HI>Kinlo&s;s</HI> (a favorite, brought by his maje&s;ty out of <HI>Scotland</HI>) or to his &s;on <HI>Thomas</HI> earl of <HI>Elgin.</HI> It continued for &s;ome time in his po&s;terity, earls of <HI>Elgin</HI> and of <HI>Ayle&s;bury.</HI> It became, about the year 1690 (by purcha&s;e) the property of lord <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who built the hou&s;e; which &s;till retains nearly the original form. It was alienated by <HI>John,</HI> the fir&s;t earl of that title, between the years 1720 and 1730, to lord vi&s;count <HI>Fitz-William.</HI> His lord&s;hip &s;old it, in the year 1736, to lady <HI>Gowran,</HI> grandmother to the pre&s;ent lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory.</HI></P>

The hou&s;e is &s;eated on a bold eminence, and commands a fine view. Two of the fronts are very beautiful; each has an elegant portico and loggio above. On the intervening &s;pace are variety of cyphers, devices, and cre&s;ts; &s;uch as bears and ragged &s;taves, &s;taves and palms, crowned lions and crowns, and beards of arrows, or hedge-hogs and porcupines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an old edition of the <HI>Arcadia,</HI> date 1629, is a hedge-hog, or porcupine, as a cre&s;t to the top of a fronti&s;piece.

Some of the&s;e certainly relate to the <HI>Sydnies.</HI> This gave ri&s;e to the a&s;&s;ertion of the editor of <HI>Cambden,</HI> that it was built by the counte&s;s of <HI>Pembroke,</HI>
<Q><HI>Sydney</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s mother;</Q>and that the model was contrived by her brother, the incompa|rable Sir <HI>Philip Sydney,</HI> in his <HI>Arcadia.</HI> From the letters on the &s;outh front, I.

<P>THE portico and loggio are of &s;tone, and ornamented with
<PB N="382" REF="419">
columns of the Doric and Ionic orders: the re&s;t of the hou&s;e is of brick. The fronts are unequal; one being a hundred and twenty-two feet in extent; the other, only &s;eventy-three feet &s;ix inches.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e and manor were purcha&s;ed by the late duke of <HI>Bed|ford,</HI> from <HI>Charles</HI> earl of <HI>Ayle&s;bury,</HI> and with it the &s;teward&s;hip of the honor of <HI>Ampthill,</HI> hold under the crown.</P>
<P>THIS place mu&s;t not be confounded with <HI>Houghton Conque&s;t:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HOUGHTON CONQUEST.</NOTE> a very antient hou&s;e, at the foot of the hill.

His grand&s;on, <HI>Thomas,</HI> was created lord <HI>Hoo</HI> and <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. in 1447. He, if no mi&s;take is made in the ac|count, &s;ettled two parts of the tithes on the abbey of <HI>St. Alban's,</HI> for the u&s;e of &s;trangers. Lord <HI>Hoo</HI> left only daughters.

<P>ABOUT two miles to the north-ea&s;t of <HI>Luton Hoo,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">SOMMERIS.</NOTE> is the village of <HI>Sommeris,</HI> where, as <HI>Leland</HI> informs us, lord <HI>Wenlock</HI> had begun &s;umptuou&s;ly a hou&s;e, but never fini&s;hed it: that the gatehou&s;e of brick was very fair and large. The gateway and part of a tower are yet to be &s;een. In the la&s;t are fourteen or fifteen brick &s;teps; and there was originally a hole, or rather pipe, which conveyed the lowe&s;t whi&s;per from bottom to top. Part of this, and of the other building, was pulled down by Sir <HI>John Napier,</HI> about forty years ago. <HI>Leland</HI> al&s;o acquaints us, that the&s;e e&s;tates of lord <HI>Wenlock</HI> pa&s;&s;ed, by marriage of an heir general <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leland,</HI> vi. 63.</NOTE> of his, to a relation of <HI>Thomas Scot,</HI> alias <HI>Rotherham,</HI> archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> from 1480 to 1500: a prelate remarkable for nepoti&s;m, and the prefer|ment of his kindred by marriage, and other ways <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Goodwin Pro&s;.

<HEAD>N^o V. ON THE DEATH OF THE COUNTESS OF SOMERSET. See p. 372.</HEAD>
<Q>HER death was infamous: and though &s;he died (as it were) in a corner (in &s;o private a condition) the loath&s;omene&s;s of her death made it as con&s;picuous as on a hou&s;e-top: for that part of her body which had been the re|ceptacle of mo&s;t of her &s;in, grown rotten (though &s;he never had but one child) the ligaments failing, it fell down, and was cut away in flakes, with a mo&s;t nau&s;eous and putrid &s;avour; which to augment, &s;he would roll her&s;elf in her own ordure in her bed; took delight in it. Thus her affections varied; for nothing could be found &s;weet enough to augment her beauties at fir&s;t, and nothing &s;tinking enough to decypher her loath|&s;omene&s;s at la&s;t. Pardon the &s;harpne&s;s of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; for they are for the glory of God; who often makes his pu|ni&s;hments (in the balance of his ju&s;tice) of equal weight with our &s;ins. <BIBL><HI>Wil&s;on's Life of King James I.</HI> p. 83.</BIBL></Q>
