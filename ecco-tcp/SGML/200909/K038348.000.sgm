<P>THE following Treati&s;e aims at truths of the mo&s;t &s;ublime nature, which the mo&s;t ex|alted powers of the human mind are incapable fully to illu&s;trate; yet, notwith&s;tanding their &s;ublimity, common under&s;tandings, pro|perly exerci&s;ed, may enter deeply into, and draw much comfort and &s;atisfaction from, them. I mu&s;t confe&s;s my in&s;ufficiency for &s;uch an undertaking; but as it is allowable for chil|dren and idiots rapturou&s;ly to &s;urvey any ob|ject that is pre&s;ented to their view, and thus to call the attention of others to behold and partake of the plea&s;ures they enjoy, I have, from the &s;ame motives, pre&s;umed to publi&s;h my thoughts, hoping the candid reader will
<PB N="vi" REF="3">overlook all the weakne&s;s of the in&s;trument, and examine and weigh well the facts touched upon, and &s;trike a fair balance. Plain truth needs not human embelli&s;hment, though it is the general ta&s;te of the times to have every thing that appears in public dre&s;&s;ed up in good language; if this be wanting, it is deemed un|&s;avoury, and the cook is condemned, notwith|&s;tanding the di&s;h may contain the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome food: but if it is thus adorned, though the contents be nothing but chaff, it is &s;wal|lowed down with greedine&s;s. This little Trea|ti&s;e being compo&s;ed of common plain rea&s;ons, founded on truths of the greate&s;t importance, I tru&s;t the candid reader into who&s;e hands it may fall will fairly examine, who may per|haps &s;ee more into tho&s;e facts I have, as it were, but hinted at, than I can, though he might never have beheld them in the &s;ame point of view before. I therefore hope &s;uch will not condemn my performance before examination, becau&s;e contrary to the gene|ral opinion of the &s;cientific; but will bring my arguments to the touch&s;tone or proper &s;tandard of rea&s;on, or the Scripture. The evidences I have adduced to prove the truth
<PB N="vii" REF="4">of my hypothe&s;is, let them be tried by rea&s;on; tho&s;e I have u&s;ed to prove, that the books of Nature, Providence, and Revelation, all de|clare one and the &s;ame truth; that is, that Chri&s;t is God, or the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity, I wi&s;h to have tried by the Scrip|tures, and rea&s;on al&s;o, becau&s;e they contain what is con&s;onant thereto. I have not at|tempted to treat of the doctrine of the Trinity, but have only endeavoured to impre&s;s on the minds of my readers, that all the works of God, both in creation and providence, prove the Scriptures to be his revealed word. As to the doctrine of the Trinity, they who de&s;ire to be in&s;tructed in this Divine my&s;tery, I would refer to the works of tho&s;e &s;ervants of God who have treated on that &s;ubject; par|ticularly a &s;ermon preached at the merchants' lecture, in the meeting-hou&s;e, New Broad-&s;treet, on Tue&s;day, March 24, 1789, a copy of which, if it was printed, I could wi&s;h might be read by every per&s;on who denies or doubts this fundamental truth.</P>

Yet, con&s;idering that truth will always appear comely in its native &s;implicity, however de&s;|titute of human ornament, I have, from the importance of the &s;ubject, prevailed on my|&s;elf to re&s;t my performance on the candour of the public, tru&s;ting it may meet with that im|provement from the hands of others which could not be expected from their</P>

<HEAD>INQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING had, for many years, &s;ome doubts re&s;pecting the earth's annual revolution round the &s;un, the elevation of the poles con|tinually being the &s;ame to me hath been an in&s;urmountable difficulty; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the opinion of learned men, and their exact calculations as to the conjunctions and of the heavenly bodies, and the concurrence of per&s;ons of &s;cience of every age and country, I could not but conclude that there mu&s;t be an error &s;omewhere. I knew that all the works of God were perfect; I was al&s;o &s;atisfied that as to knowledge all mankind were imperfect; therefore, &s;eeing that all things are liable to error, and following the maxim&mdash;never to receive any thing as a truth from the authority of any one, with|out it carries its own evidence with it&mdash;if the matter be relating to nature, then, if rea&s;on &s;upports it, I have the greate&s;t obligation to re|ceive it as truth; if it be of a &s;piritual na|ture,
<PB N="2" REF="7">then, if it hath the &s;criptures to confirm it, I have the authority of the &s;criptures to con&s;ider it as certain.&mdash;On the&s;e principles I &s;et out to endeavour to come at the know|ledge of the true motions of the heavenly bo|dies and that of the earth al&s;o; and, after the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch I have been able to make into the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, I cannot find any &s;upport it hath, in common &s;en&s;e, for the ex|actne&s;s of the planets, periods, &amp;c. Every other proof it pretends to have is not &s;up|ported by rea&s;on, but cla&s;hes with it, as, I tru&s;t, will appear, from clear and evident demon|&s;tration, in the en&s;uing work, to every di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate reader who will give him&s;elf the trouble properly to weigh them.</P>
<P>In order that I may be as conci&s;e as po&s;|&s;ible, I &s;hall begin with my own hypothe&s;is, and contra&s;t it with the other as I proceed. In the fir&s;t place, I believe the centre of gravity to be fixed directly between the two poles; that all the matter, of which the globe, with its atmo&s;phere, con&s;i&s;ts, gravitates to this centre, and that round it the earth hath its continual motion, and moves once round it axis in 23 hours 56&prime; and 4&Prime;: other motion than this, it appears, from the cleare&s;t evidence, it hath
<PB N="3" REF="8">none.&mdash;Therefore, as the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year are produced either by the motion of the &s;un or earth, I am per&s;uaded, from the cleare&s;t proofs demon&s;trated from rea&s;on, that the &s;un doth really, as well as apparently, revolve round the earth; that the centre of the earth's gravity is likewi&s;e the centre of the &s;un's orbit; this orbit of the &s;un is exactly the &s;ame from the equinox as the &s;uppo&s;ed earth's orbit; in this orbit the &s;un moves 59&prime; 8&Prime; every 24 hours; as the &s;un's motion is obliquely from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and his daily progre&s;s being 59&prime; 8&Prime;, ju&s;t 59&prime; 8&Prime; doth the earth go more than once round her axis in 24 hours, which &s;he performs, in 3&prime; 56&Prime;. The&s;e two motions, that is, the &s;un's annual and the earth's diurnal motions, account for the phenomena of nature re&s;pecting the &s;igns in the zodiac, the &s;un's place, the prece&s;&s;ion of the equinoctial points, &amp;c. with more cer|tainty than the Copernican &s;y&s;tem doth with the earth's &s;uppo&s;ed threefold motions. As to the motions of the planets, it appears they have the &s;un for their centre; &s;o that, while they are revolving round the &s;un in their orbits, the &s;un is revolving round the earth in his orbit. The &s;un's orbit, or the ecliptic, being invariably fixed, the &s;un being the centre of
<PB N="4" REF="9">the orbits of the planets, the&s;e are con&s;tantly varying as the &s;un is continual in his motion: therefore the &s;un in his orbit, and the planets in theirs, are always in the &s;ame po&s;ition with the earth, now fixed as to annual motion, as they are when the &s;un is &s;uppo&s;ed to be fixed, and con&s;idered as the centre of the earth's orbit, as well as the planets; and thus each hypothe&s;is an&s;wers exactly the &s;ame with re|&s;pect to the times of the conjunction and op|po&s;ition, &amp;c. of the planets; as figure the fir&s;t, I think, will clearly prove.</P>
<P>In order to explain this figure, that it may appear in the cleare&s;t point of view, I have drawn an equinoctial line from ea&s;t to we&s;t, another, at right angles, from north to &s;outh, that is, as &s;uppo&s;ed, from pole to pole: where the&s;e lines inter&s;ect, I have de&s;cribed the earth, with the moon; on the equinoctial line, I have de&s;cribed the &s;un, with all the planets in their orbits; the earth is likewi&s;e in her &s;uppo&s;ed orbit, though I have de&s;cribed her between the poles. I then take the di&s;tance from the centre of the earth to the centre of the &s;un for a radius, and de&s;cribe the orbit of the &s;un; I then, according to the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppo&s;e the earth to be in motion, de|parted from the equinox, and arrived at 90&deg;,

<PB N="5" REF="11">the lower part of the orbit; then, at that in|&s;tant, I &s;uppo&s;e her to &s;tand &s;till; then I &s;up|po&s;e the &s;un, moon, and all the planets, in the &s;ame po&s;ition, as de&s;cribed by the black &s;pots, according to the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem; then I &s;uppo&s;e the earth to be fixed, and the &s;un to move and to depart from the equinox at the &s;ame in|&s;tant, and arrive at the 90&deg; upward, or the upper part of the orbit, at the time the earth was &s;uppo&s;ed in the like &s;ituation; then will the &s;un be due &s;outh of the earth, and the moon and every planet be exactly in the &s;ame po&s;ition in the one &s;y&s;tem as the other, which, I think, is a full proof that the Coper|nican &s;y&s;tem may be wrong; and, if it hath nothing el&s;e but the exact calculations of the periods of the conjunctions, oppo&s;itions, &amp;c. of the heavenly bodies to &s;upport it, which, I think, appears demon&s;trably clear it hath not, it certainly is wrong.</P>
<P>I come now to give &s;ome undeniable cir|cum&s;tances, that clearly prove that the &s;un is not the centre of the &s;y&s;tem, but that he moves round the earth.&mdash;Fir&s;t, The earth cannot move round the &s;un in an orbit of &s;uch va&s;t extent, and have her poles always in the &s;ame direction to the poles in the heavens; for, if
<PB N="6" REF="12">the north pole of the earth be directed to the &s;ame pole in the heavens, while &s;he moves in her orbit her &s;outh pole mu&s;t be directed to|ward the &s;outh-ea&s;t, if &s;he be in the ea&s;t part of her orbit, but if in the we&s;t part, then to the &s;outh-we&s;t. This is &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;un to be fixed in a direct line between the poles: otherwi&s;e, if the &s;un be &s;uppo&s;ed to be fixed, the di&s;tance of the &s;un from the earth, on one &s;ide of a direct line, imagined to pa&s;s from pole, and the &s;un being on the we&s;t of that line, then, at the time the earth is in the ea&s;t part of her orbit, her axis would be due north and &s;outh; but, when the earth is in the we&s;t part of her orbit, her axis, when pointing to the north pole in the heavens, the &s;outh pole of the earth, would be direct from the north pole, &s;outh-we&s;t and by &s;outh. But this la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;o vague and uncertain that I cannot think men of &s;cience, who con&s;ider what they &s;ay, will affirm it, though I have met with one who a&s;&s;erted that the &s;un was not in a direct line between the poles in the heavens. But let the &s;un be &s;uppo&s;ed to be fixed ac|cording to either, what I have &s;aid would be the ca&s;e, which I prove thus: fir&s;t, I &s;up|po&s;e that though the poles of the heavens
<PB N="7" REF="13">extend <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> I likewi&s;e conjecture that their influences both meet in the centre of the earth, and that there is a certain point of in|ter&s;ection, to which the eye is directed from the different meridians of the earth, which point of inter&s;ection is at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the earth as the &s;un is, which is a demon&s;tration evidently clear; for, when the &s;un is in the equinox, to a per&s;on on the equator, behold|ing the &s;un in the horizon, his antipode, and two more, one under each pole, the&s;e four would behold the &s;un in the horizon at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant of time; likewi&s;e to four per&s;ons, one on each quarter of the equator, the poles will be in the horizon to each of them: therefore, as the per&s;on who is on the equator, if he travel north till he bring the pole in his zenith, every degree he travelled &s;o much would the pole be elevated, till he brought the pole to his zenith; &s;o likewi&s;e a per&s;on on the equator, when the &s;un is in the equinox, and he beholds the &s;un in the horizon, and remains till the &s;un is in his zenith, every degree the &s;un ri&s;es, &s;o much is the &s;un ele|vated to him till it is in his zenith. Or, for a further illu&s;tration, &s;uppo&s;e both the &s;un and the earth to be fixed, while the per&s;on on the equa|tor,
<PB N="8" REF="14">who beholds the &s;un in the horizon, tra|vels ea&s;t to bring the &s;un in his zenith, then every degree he travelled, &s;o much would the &s;un be elevated, until he reached ninety de|grees, when the &s;un would be in his zenith. &mdash;From all which it appears, in the cleare&s;t manner, that the &s;un and poles in the heavens are at nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance from the earth.</P>
<P>Again, with re&s;pect to the motion of the &s;un; to a &s;pectator on the equator, when the &s;un is in the equinox, and he beholds the &s;un in the horizon, if the poles were as vi&s;ible as the &s;un, he and his antipode might behold the &s;un and both the poles in the horizon at the &s;ame time, at equal di&s;tance from them, the one north, the other ea&s;t, the other &s;outh; con&s;equently the &s;un mu&s;t be at right angles with the poles, and &s;o they continue all the day, and likewi&s;e all the year; for, though it appears more clear to our view while the &s;un is in the horizon, when we con&s;ider that the &s;un is always in that po&s;ition to one part of the equator or other all the revolution, it will manife&s;tly appear that he is at right angles with the poles all the year: when the &s;un is in the equinox, both legs of the angle are equal, but in his declination the legs of the

<PB N="9" REF="16">angle are unequal. For a more clear expla|nation &s;ee figure the &s;econd, where the earth is fixed between the poles, the circle repre|&s;ents the horizon, the &s;un is &s;hewn in the equinox, in both points of the heavens, and likewi&s;e in both tropics, the &s;un is &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round the earth in a circle, who&s;e di|men&s;ion is the &s;ame as that de&s;cribed for the horizon, and who&s;e plan is according to the ecliptic that is &s;hewn in the figure, and may be conceived to be perpendicular to the hori|zon; &s;o that, when the &s;un is in the equinox, he will appear in the horizon as &s;hewn in the figure; when in the tropic it appears the &s;ame as &s;hewn in the figure to a per&s;on on the equa|tor, and in the intermediate part between the equinox, and the tropic; wherever the &s;un is in the ecliptic, that di&s;tance the &s;un is from the equinox, the &s;ame will he appear in the horizon. This figure plainly &s;hews that the apparent mo|tion of the &s;un is not only the apparent, but the real, motion of the &s;un. Now to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un to be fixed, and the earth to move round the &s;un, is not only to invert nature, or turn things up&s;ide down, but in&s;ide out, fora&s;much as the &s;un encircles the earth in his revolu|tions, and not the earth the &s;un. To &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="17">the earth to move round the &s;un, we mu&s;t take the di&s;tance of the &s;un from the earth for a radius to de&s;cribe the orbit of the earth; but where is the &s;un to be fixed for the centre, &s;o that the whole of the revolution, the poles in the heavens, &s;hall have always the &s;ame elevation, and the &s;un to be at right angles with the poles at all times? If the &s;un be &s;uppo&s;ed to be fixed between the poles, then the earth mu&s;t be where I have marked the &s;un to be, and the &s;un where I have &s;up|po&s;ed the earth; if &s;o, in what manner are we to frame our conceptions, &s;o that the &s;un (which is, according to this &s;uppo&s;ition, in a direct line between the poles) may appear at right angles with the poles at all times: how is this to be reconciled to rea&s;on? The im|men&s;e greater di&s;tance of the poles from the earth, than the &s;un is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, nor the paralleli&s;m of the earth's axis, in her &s;uppo&s;ed revolution, will not reconcile this contrariety in nature; becau&s;e it is evident to clear de|mon&s;tration that the poles in the heavens, or the&s;e invi&s;ible points to which the eye is direct|ed to from the different parts of the earth, in a proper elevation, and looking direct north or &s;outh, according to which pole we are ob|&s;erving;
<PB N="11" REF="18">I &s;ay it is evident that the&s;e points in the heavens cannot be &s;een from the earth in one part of the earth's diurnal motion, though it may be in other parts, that is on the &s;up|po&s;ition of the earth's annual revolution, and the parelleli&s;m of its axis. To demon&s;trate this, &s;ee figure the &s;econd, where the earth is repre&s;ented in her &s;uppo&s;ed orbit, with her axis parallel to an imaginary line pa&s;&s;ing from pole to pole. Now if we &s;uppo&s;e the axis of the earth always parallel in the whole of the revolution, the axis of cour&s;e mu&s;t form an ellip&s;is, though the orbit be an exact circle; and that becau&s;e of the obliquity of the plane of the orbit, which is according to the ecliptic. As the earth is &s;uppo&s;ed to move round this orbit, it mu&s;t be granted that one meridian of the earth or another is always directed to the centre of the orbit, or the imaginary line from pole to pole; of cour&s;e the oppo&s;ite meridians mu&s;t be direct the contrary way; therefore two per&s;ons on the &s;ame parallel of latitude, but op|po&s;ite meridian, when the&s;e two men are view|ing the invi&s;ible point in the heavens their eyes or &s;ight inter&s;ect at that point. Now fora&s;|much as the axis of the earth is always parallel to the imaginary line from pole to pole, that
<PB N="12" REF="19">point of inter&s;ection to which the ob&s;ervers are directed to, will be at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the poles as the earth is from the centre of her orbit: and, with re&s;pect to the con&s;ideration of the immen&s;e di&s;tance the poles are &s;uppo&s;ed to be from the earth, &s;o far as that the orbit of the earth &s;ubtends no more than a point, I will grant that the ob&s;erver who faces the line from pole to pole, or the centre of the orbit, may &s;ee the invi&s;ible point in the hea|vens; but the ob&s;erver, who&s;e back is towards the centre of the orbit, cannot &s;ee the &s;ame point in the heavens, no not if the poles are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o far from earth that her orbit would &s;ubtend but half a point; becau&s;e the further his &s;ight is carried beyond the point of inter&s;ection, &s;o much the further from the object; but &s;ome may object and &s;ay,&mdash;<Q>Can|not I move my eye, and &s;ee the point where the pole is?</Q> I an&s;wer, No: a man cannot behold an object and look from it at the &s;ame in&s;tant; and, when a per&s;on beholds an object in the heavens, there is a di&s;k around that ob|ject that is within the compa&s;s of the &s;ight, therefore the object looked at is always the centre of that compa&s;s; for which rea&s;on the earth in her &s;uppo&s;ed orbit revolves round it.
<PB N="13" REF="20">The one half of the globe of the earth mu&s;t be within the orbit, the other half without; then that ob&s;erver of the orbit on the out&s;ide, if his eye be directed to the oppo&s;ite meridian where the other ob&s;erver is, looks directly into the orbit; and the examiner, if he look to the oppo&s;ite ob&s;erver, &s;ees directly out of the or|bit; but if they elevate their &s;ight to the exact elevation of the pole, their &s;ight will inter&s;ect at one point; and round this point each ob|&s;erver will behold a like compa&s;s of the heaven &s;urround this point, and then it will not be exactly alike in the &s;ame part of the heavens, but in a mea&s;ure oppo&s;ite; therefore that per&s;on on the in&s;ide of the orbit, when endeavouring to view the pole from the earth, could not &s;ee the pole in the heavens, were the earth to move in the &s;uppo&s;ed orbit. This I pre&s;ume is &s;o clear, that no man under the influence of rea&s;on, however great and learned, can deny.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to prove that the third &s;uppo&s;ed motion of the earth, viz. the poles of the world, revolve round the poles of the ecliptic, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to account for the apparent motion of the equinoctial points, is groundle&s;s; neither can I conceive it to be con&s;i&s;tent with truth: for if the earth's axis
<PB N="14" REF="21">departs from its paralleli&s;m, and its equator move with its axis, and the ecliptic remain invariable, then of cour&s;e the angle of the ecliptic from the equator mu&s;t continually vary; and though it be but &s;lowly, it will, though in a &s;low degree, alter the &s;un's de|clination. Neither can I conceive how the poles of the world are to revolve round the poles of the ecliptic without confu&s;ion. For if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that in the beginning both poles of the earth pointed to the poles in the heavens, and then began to revolve round the poles of the ecliptic, then, though the motion be &s;low, the angle of the earth's axis from the poles in the heavens would increa&s;e; for if one pole of the earth &s;et off towards the ea&s;t, the other mu&s;t &s;et off towards the we&s;t; and when the poles of the earth had gone half their revolution, then one would be ea&s;t and the other we&s;t. Now if the ecliptic pole be the centre of the tract which the poles of the earth point out, then would the axis of the earth from an angle from the poles of the heavens of 47&deg;. But if in their revolution they only point at the ecliptic poles, and take them in the tract as they point out, then the angle could not be le&s;s than 23&deg; 30&prime;; this
<PB N="15" REF="22">would make the angle of the ecliptic from the equator 47&deg;, or reduce it to nothing, for|a&s;much as the ecliptic is invariable; but if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the poles of the earth, in their revolution round tho&s;e of the ecliptic, from the beginning were always oppo&s;ite each other in their revolutions, and the ecliptic poles the centre of the tract they point out, then would the axis of the earth be always at an angle of 47&deg;, from an imaginary line from pole to pole in the heavens;&mdash;each of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions appear contrary to nature. I think the real cau&s;e of the apparent motion of the equinoctial points evidently appears to proceed from the &s;un's annual revolution and the earth's diurnal motion round her axis, and is &s;imply thus: I &s;uppo&s;e, as before, that the &s;un moves round the earth in his orbit, at the rate of 59&prime; 8&Prime; in the &s;pace of 24 hours; ju&s;t &s;o many minutes and &s;econds does the earth move more than once round her axis in 24 hours: but as the earth's motion is from we&s;t to ea&s;t directly, and the &s;un's but obliquely, &s;o, therefore, tough the &s;un comes to the &s;ame point in the heavens exactly every revo|lution, he, on account of his oblique motion to the earth, gains on that of the earth &s;ome|thing
<PB N="16" REF="23">every revolution, but in proce&s;s of time will appear; for, though the &s;un comes to the &s;ame point in the equinox, exactly the &s;ame time every revolution, the &s;ame &s;tar will not appear in the horizon at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time as it did &s;ome years before, becau&s;e the earth does not keep pace exactly with the &s;un in her rotations.</P>
<P>Now, as the equinoctial points have ap|parently moved &s;ince the time of Hipparchus 30&deg;, and as he lived &s;ome time before the Chri&s;tian aera, I &s;uppo&s;e the difference of time between his ob&s;ervation, and tho&s;e which were made when the difference of the equinoctial points was di&s;covered to be 30&deg;, near 1800 years; if &s;o, then as 30&deg; are 1800&prime;, the &s;un comes to the &s;ame point in the equinox one minute in the year before the &s;ame meridian of the earth in her rotation arrives to the &s;ame &s;tar it was under the year before.&mdash;This, I think, is &s;o clear, that, after a careful inve&s;ti|gation, it cannot be denied by any per&s;on of learning, candour, and probity.</P>
<P>I have made &s;everal attempts to communi|cate my thoughts to men of &s;cience, hoping to meet with their concurrence, after a due exa|mination of the facts herein contained, but all
<PB N="17" REF="24">without effect: therefore, being confident of the truth of my hypothe&s;is, and al&s;o believing that no man is able, on ju&s;t and rea&s;onable grounds, to refute it, I take this method of publi&s;hing them, convinced that, from being expo&s;ed to the world, they may fall into the hands of &s;ome di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate readers, who will vouch&s;afe to contemplate and weigh my ar|guments; and if they find them agreeable to truth, will not de&s;pi&s;e them on account of the meanne&s;s of the publi&s;her; nor be a&s;hamed to become my advocates, becau&s;e error hath &s;o long prevailed, and does &s;till prevail. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I hope &s;ome of the learned will inve&s;tigate my hypothe&s;is, and from thence determine whether the time of the conjunctions, oppo&s;itions, &amp;c. do or do not an&s;wer exactly the &s;ame as in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem. If they &s;hould prove the &s;ame, I think it will be a &s;ufficient evidence that it is founded on truth, becau&s;e &s;o many contrarieties are removed, and harmony runs through the whole.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that my hyothe&s;is, though it &s;hould prove to be according to truth upon the cleare&s;t evidence, will, notwith&s;tanding all that can be &s;aid in its &s;upport, meet with great oppo&s;ition. The different di&s;po&s;itions of men will cau&s;e them to oppo&s;e it from dif|ferent
<PB N="18" REF="25">motives; &s;ome will condemn it on ac|count of the ability of its author, others from mere envy; and many who may &s;ee the truth of it, if they could by any means claim it as their own, would vehemently contend for it; if they could not claim it as their own by any means, they would oppo&s;e it. Of this la&s;t &s;ort I have rea&s;on to think there may be many, having met with &s;uch treat|ment in another matter of a public nature, wherein I tru&s;ted to the honour of the party, being no ways &s;u&s;picious of any one's taking the hint that I gave, and appropriating it to their own u&s;e. Had I been aware of &s;uch treatment, and &s;o &s;ecured it to my&s;elf that no one could have deprived me of it, I am fully per&s;uaded it would have met &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that it would not have been put into execu|tion; however, it was and is a &s;ecret &s;atisfac|tion that I was in any wi&s;e u&s;eful, though I lo&s;t the honour that was my due, and &s;ome pounds, in endeavouring to recover it.&mdash;Such was my reward!</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to prove the truth of my hypothe&s;is, by an&s;wering the rea&s;ons and de|mon&s;trative proofs given in Middleton's Dic|tionary of Arts and Sciences to prove the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem to be the only true &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="26">1&s;t Rea&s;on. It is mo&s;t &s;imple and agree|able to the tenor of Nature in all her actions: for by the two motions of the earth all the phenomena of the heavens are re&s;olved, which by other hypothe&s;es are inexplicable, without a great number of other motions contrary to philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, It is more &s;imple and more agree|able to the tenor of Nature, in all her actions, to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;un moves round the earth, according to my hypothe&s;is; becau&s;e every ob|&s;tacle is removed, and the whole phenomena of the heavens re&s;olved agreeable to truth, with not &s;o many motions by one, and exactly con|&s;onant with right rea&s;on.</P>
<P>2d Rea&s;on. It is more rational to &s;uppo&s;e that the earth moves round the &s;un than that the huge bodies of the planets, and the &s;tu|pendous body of the &s;un, and the immen&s;e firmament of &s;tars, &s;hould move round the in|con&s;iderable bodies of the earth every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, That, notwith&s;tanding the hugene&s;s of the planets, and the &s;tupendous body of the &s;un, it evidently appears, that the planets do move round the &s;un, while the &s;un is moving round the incon&s;iderable
<PB N="20" REF="27">body of the earth; therefore the exterior and interior planets do move round the earth as they are moving round the &s;un; and, agreeable to common under&s;tanding, as to the immen&s;e firmament of &s;tars my hypothe&s;is is not con|cerned.</P>
<P>3d Rea&s;on. But that harmony, which upon this &s;uppo&s;ition runs through the whole &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, wonderfully confirms this hypothe&s;is, viz. that the motions of all the planets, both primary and &s;econdary, are governed and re|gulated by one and the &s;ame law; which is, that the &s;quares of the periodical times of the primary planets are to each other as the cubes of their di&s;tances from the &s;un; and likewi&s;e the &s;quares of the periodical times of the &s;e|condaries of any primary are to each others as the cubes of their di&s;tance from that primary. Now the moon which, in the Copernican &s;y&s;|tem, is a &s;econdary of the earth, in other hy|pothe&s;es is a primary one, and &s;o the rule can|not take place, becau&s;e the periodical time, con&s;idered as of a primary one, does not agree therewith.</P>
<P>To this rea&s;on I an&s;wer, That the harmony that runs through my &s;uppo&s;ition appears much more perfect, and without confu&s;ion, which can|not
<PB N="21" REF="28">be proved to be &s;o in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, though it be &s;o frequently affirmed: and, how|ever the Ptolemaic &s;y&s;tem, or any other that hath appeared in the world, is proved to be ab&s;urd, this doth not prove the Copernican &s;y&s;tem to be exactly according to truth: for, though the Copernican &s;y&s;tem come &s;o near the truth as to di&s;cover the true motion of all the heavenly bodies except one, and that the principal one, and mi&s;taking it, and &s;uppo&s;ing the earth to move in his room; now, though to appearance it is true, becau&s;e of the exact calculation of the eclip&s;es, &amp;c. yet, if every ob&s;tacle be not removed, there remains a doubt; and that every ob&s;tacle is not removed apears beyond contradiction. Now if the &s;uppo&s;ition of the earth's motion round the &s;un an&s;wer the &s;ame to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un to move round the earth, with re&s;pect to the conjunctions, &amp;c. of the planets, one mu&s;t be erroneous; and that the earth's motion is &s;o, I &s;hall make u&s;e of this &s;ame author's argu|ment which he u&s;ed to prove the Copernican &s;y&s;tem to be the true &s;y&s;tem, where, &s;peaking of the word &s;y&s;tem, he goes on thus: It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that we are a&s;&s;ured things may (nay mu&s;t) appear to be in many ca&s;es
<PB N="22" REF="29">what they really are not; to have &s;uch affec|tions and properties as are ab&s;olutely contrary to what they really po&s;&s;e&s;s. Thus a per&s;on, &s;itting in the cabin of a &s;hip under &s;ail, will, by looking out of the cabin window, &s;ee the ap|parent motion of the hou&s;es and the trees, &amp;c. on the &s;trand the contrary way.&mdash;This argument is ju&s;t &s;uitable for me to return; ju&s;t &s;o it was with Pythagoras, and the re&s;t of the great and learned among the ancients; they had got on board the &s;hip Speculation; and &s;he being moored in the &s;un, as they were in motion with him, they looked out at the cabin-win|dow and beheld the earth in apparent motion, which they thought was real, and to be mov|ing round the &s;un; had they come upon deck they would have been able to look round them; then probably they might have di&s;co|vered the elevation of the poles; but being in the &s;un, and thinking the poles at &s;uch an amaz|ing di&s;tance, they might think it too trifling for their notice, and &s;o leaped over it.&mdash;But as all the works of the great Creator of the univer&s;e are perfect, we &s;hould &s;o con|&s;ider them. Thus the ancients, having di&s;|covered the Ptolemaic &s;y&s;tem to be ab&s;urd, founded another not free from ab&s;urdity,
<PB N="23" REF="30">though it hath been confirmed by the con|currence of the learned of all ages, &s;ince they have all &s;at in the &s;ame cabin, and looked out at the &s;ame window. As to the one and the &s;ame law, that governs and regulates the motions of the planets, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I do not under&s;tand it, neither do I believe any mor|tal ever did, or ever will, while in this mortal &s;tate; and it appears plain to me, that the author of the&s;e rea&s;ons was not acquainted per|fectly with the laws of nature, fora&s;much as the &s;un does move round the earth as well as the moon, and &s;till the moon is a &s;econdary of the earth.</P>
<P>4th Rea&s;on. Again, this &s;imple con&s;idera|tion Mr. Whi&s;ton thinks enough to e&s;tabli&s;h the motion of the earth for ever, viz. if the earth do not move round the &s;un, the &s;un with the moon mu&s;t move round the earth. Now the di&s;tance of the &s;un to that of the moon being as 10,000 to 46, and the moon's period being le&s;s than 28 days, the &s;un's pe|riod would be found no le&s;s than 242 years, whereas in fact it is but one year.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer. Mr. Whi&s;ton framed this rea&s;on from the beforementioned laws, with an endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the earth's mo|tion;
<PB N="24" REF="31">but I think it will appear, from due con&s;ideration, that Mr. Whi&s;ton has over&s;et or broken the notion that men had of the laws that regulated the motions of the planets, &amp;c. rather than e&s;tabli&s;hed them; for I think, ac|cording to plain rea&s;on, it will appear that the earth is at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the &s;un as the &s;un is from the earth: therefore, if the earth move round the &s;un, the &s;un is the centre of the earth's orbit; but if the &s;un move round the earth, then the earth is the centre of the &s;un's orbit&mdash;the di&s;tance being the &s;ame, the orbit will be the &s;ame; &s;o that the moon being called a primary, or a &s;econ|dary, has nothing to do with the real mo|tions; for if the &s;un's period would require 242 years, &s;o would the earth require the &s;ame, the proportional di&s;tance being equal: therefore, if in fact the earth be thought to move round the &s;un in one year, &s;o I think it is clear that the &s;un moves round the earth in one year. This and the foregoing rea&s;on have no weight in the balance of truth: and I judge, on fair con&s;ideration, this over&s;ight of Mr. Whi&s;ton turns out more for my hypo|the&s;is than again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">5th Rea&s;on. The &s;un is the fountain of light and heat, which irradiates through all the &s;y&s;tem, and, therefore, it ought to be placed in the centre, &s;o that the planets may at all times have it in an uniform and equal manner.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That, according to my hypothe&s;is, the &s;un is the centre of the planets' orbits, and always at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the earth, &s;o that the planets, and earth al&s;o, have the &s;ame benefit from the &s;un as &s;hewn in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>6th Rea&s;on. For if the earth be in the centre, and the &s;un and planets revolve round it, the planets would then, like the comets, be &s;corched with heat when neare&s;t the &s;un and frozen with cold in their aphelia or greate&s;t di&s;tance, which is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, In my hypothe&s;is, the earth, be|ing the centre of the &s;un's orbit, and the &s;un the centre of the planes' orbits, &s;ecures the planets from the&s;e inconveniences.</P>
<P>7th Rea&s;on. If the &s;un be placed in the centre of the &s;y&s;tem, we then have the rational hypothe&s;is of the planets being all moved about the &s;un, by the univer&s;al law or power of gravity ari&s;ing from his va&s;t body, and every
<PB N="26" REF="33">thing will an&s;wer to the laws of circular mo|tion and central force; but otherwi&s;e we are wholly in the dark, and know nothing of the laws and operations of Nature.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, My hypothe&s;is is more rational, becau&s;e freed from all incumbrance. As to the univer&s;al law or power of gravity and central forces, as it may re&s;pect the motions of the planets round the &s;un, I have nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it, as it is above my conception; but that the earth is governed by &s;uch laws, would be &s;aying more than can be proved; for, as no man can &s;ay what matter the heavenly bodies are compo&s;ed of, it appears to me to be be|yond the reach of mortals to attain to the knowledge of the law that governs them. If I might be allowed the u&s;e of the word &s;piri|tual, to convey my ideas, (for I know not how el&s;e) and a&s;k the que&s;tion if the heavenly bodies be of a &s;piritual nature, whether the &s;un, notwith&s;tanding his &s;tupendous bulk, may not be le&s;s, ponderous than the earth, as bing of a different nature, &s;eeing that the all-wi&s;e Creator hath made the &s;un to be the life of the whole creation; that the pure light or fire that proceeds from it fills the whole created &s;pace, which, though infinite, nothing
<PB N="27" REF="34">is hid from the heat, and that it penetrates even to the centre of the earth; therefore, as by ex|periment it is proved that lead, tin, or regulus of antimony, being expo&s;ed to the fire of a burning gla&s;s, though they lo&s;e much in &s;moke and &s;team, are neverthele&s;s found to be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in weight; from which it appears, that the light which proceeds from the &s;un comes on the earth with great force; and if the earth was moving round the &s;un this force would continually remove the earth fur|ther from him. But in an&s;wer to this it may be &s;aid, this may be the centrifugal force; but then where is the law or power of gravity that ari&s;es from his va&s;t body? To talk of centri|petal force without any proof, appears to be no|thing more than the force of imagination; and imaginary force is of no force at all;&mdash;there|fore it appears to me that it is too great a pre|&s;umption for &s;inful mortals to attempt to di&s;|cover how the Almighty made all things, or by what laws he governs the heavenly bodies. For as to the laws of motion, and the other laws of nature, I think the greate&s;t of men, if they &s;et out on this di&s;covery with ever &s;o much inten&s;ene&s;s, will find them&s;elves far &s;hort of the truth, even before they begin to
<PB N="28" REF="35">a&s;cend to the heavens.&mdash;If they proceed regu|larly, (and for men in pur&s;uit after knowledge thus to proceed, is fir&s;t to begin with them|&s;elves and to &s;tudy their own formation and the laws concerning it) they will in the fir&s;t place con&s;ider whether they can conceive properly the law of generation, in what manner they were formed in the womb, and how the &s;oul is joined to the body while in that &s;tate, and how every part increa&s;es; and when born, and grown to maturity, by what law they live and move. I believe, after all the inquiry men are able to make into the&s;e laws, the only ju&s;t conclu&s;ion that can be made will be this: that it is <Q>in God we live, and move, and have our being.</Q> There are many things on the terraqueous globe re&s;pecting the laws of Nature, both as to motion and the formation of the &s;everal productions of the earth and &s;ea, that elude the &s;earch of the mo&s;t diligent.</P>
<P>If the greate&s;t men are &s;trangers, and can give no rea&s;ons, &s;o as to account for the laws of Nature concerning them&s;elves, can it rea|&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed they can account for the formation of the earth or heavenly bodies, or the cau&s;e of the re&s;pective motions?&mdash;It is an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing that the all-wi&s;e Creator
<PB N="29" REF="36">has given &s;ufficient wi&s;dom unto men to enable them to under&s;tand the operation of Nature, &s;o as to prove u&s;eful to mankind in general; but as to the laws of Nature, they are a &s;ecret that be|long unto God. I cannot but make the &s;ame conclu&s;ion with this author, when he &s;ays, that if it be otherwi&s;e than what he a&s;&s;erts, we are wholly in the dark, and know nothing of the laws and operations of Nature. As to the laws of Nature, I believe all men have been, and now are, wholly in the dark; but as to the operations of Nature, they have great but not perfect light; for I believe many things will be di&s;covered that now lie hid.</P>
<P>8th Rea&s;on. But happily we are able to give not only rea&s;ons, but demon&s;trative proofs, that the &s;un does po&s;&s;e&s;s the centre of the &s;y&s;tem, and that the planets move about it at the di&s;tance and in the order a&s;&s;igned in this and other places.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is that Mercury and Venus are ever ob&s;erved to have two conjunctions with the &s;un, but no oppo&s;ition, which could not happen unle&s;s their orbits lay within the orbit of the earth.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on my hypothe&s;is denies; but with the demon&s;trative proof it agrees, only by leaving out the words orbit of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">9th Rea&s;on, and &s;econd Proof is, That Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have each their conjunc|tion and oppo&s;ition to the &s;un alternately and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, which could not be, unle&s;s their orbits were exterior to the orbit of the earth.</P>
<P>With this Rea&s;on and Proof my hypothe&s;is agrees al&s;o, with only leaving out the words orbit of the earth.</P>
<P>10th Rea&s;on and third Proof. The greate&s;t elongation or di&s;tance of Mercury from the &s;un is 20&deg;, and that of Venus 47&deg;, which an|&s;wers exactly to the di&s;tance in this &s;y&s;tem; though in the Ptolemaic &s;y&s;tem they might and would &s;ometimes be &s;een 180&deg; from the &s;un, viz. in oppo&s;ition to him.</P>
<P>Between this Rea&s;on and Proof there is not the lea&s;t di&s;agreement with my hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>11th Rea&s;on and fourth Proof is, In this di&s;|po&s;ition of the planets they will all of them be &s;ometimes much nearer to the earth than at other times; the con&s;equence of which is, that their brightne&s;s and &s;plendour, and al&s;o their apparent diameters, will be proportionably greater at one time than another; and this we ob&s;erve to be true every day. Thus the ap|parent diameter of Venus is near 66&Prime; when greate&s;t, but when lea&s;t not more than 9&Prime; and
<PB N="31" REF="38">a half; of Mars when greate&s;t it is 21&Prime;, but when lea&s;t no more than 2&Prime; and a half; whereas, by the Ptolemaic hypothe&s;is, they ought to be always equal.</P>
<P>To this Rea&s;on and Proof my hypothe&s;is exactly agrees.</P>
<P>12th Rea&s;on and fifth Proof is, That when the planets are viewed with a good tele&s;cope they appear with different pha&s;es, or with dif|rent parts of their bodies enlightened. Thus Venus is &s;ometimes new, then horned, and af|terwards dichotomized; then gibbous; after|wards full; and &s;o increa&s;es and decrea&s;es in the &s;ame manner as the moon, and as the Co|pernican &s;y&s;tem requires.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That my hypothe&s;is requires ex|actly the &s;ame in every re&s;pect as the Coper|nican does, with regard to the different pha&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>13th Rea&s;on and &s;ixth Proof is, That the planets all of them do appear direct in mo|tion, &s;ometimes retrograde, and at other times &s;tationary. Thus Venus, as &s;he pa&s;&s;es from her greate&s;t elongation we&s;tward to her greate&s;t elongation ea&s;tward, will appear direct in motion, but retrograde as &s;he pa&s;&s;es from the latter to the former; and when &s;he is in
<PB N="32" REF="39">tho&s;e points of greate&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;un &s;he &s;eems for &s;ome time &s;tationary; all which is nece&s;&s;ary upon the Copernican hypothe&s;is, but cannot happen in any other.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That all the&s;e motions of the planets and appearances my hypothe&s;is agrees to; and not only the planets' retrograde and direct motions, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of the &s;un and earth; though not apparent to the eye yet clear to the under&s;tanding. My hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;es the &s;un to move in his orbit from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, as to the we&s;t and ea&s;t points of the heavens; and, to an eye placed in the ecliptic pole, it would appear &s;o, though never would appear &s;tationary; &s;o to a per&s;on on the equator beholding the &s;un in the horizon when the &s;un is in the equinox, if he look ea&s;t, his antipode beholds the &s;un at the &s;ame in&s;tant while he is looking we&s;t; &s;o likewi&s;e as to the earth in her diurnal motion, &s;uppo&s;e the meridian of London, according to appearance as to its motion we are looking ea&s;t to &s;ee the &s;tars ri&s;e, but when the meridian comes under the ea&s;t point of the heavens, from that in&s;tant we are going we&s;t, as to the hea|vens; therefore all have their con&s;tant motions round their orbits, and the earth round her
<PB N="33" REF="40">axis, and &s;ometimes in direct, and &s;ometimes in retrograde, motions; and to an eye &s;quare from the plane of the orbit there would be no &s;tationary appearance, it being the obliquity of the plane of the orbit to us that the &s;ta|tionary appearance of the planet &s;eems to be. As to the planets being at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;un at one time than another, my hypothe&s;is knows nothing of it; and as to the different motions of the planets being nece&s;&s;ary upon the Copernican hypothe&s;is, but cannot happen to any other, I will venture to &s;ay the a&s;&s;ertion of the author upon that &s;ubject was premature.</P>
<P>14th Rea&s;on and &s;eventh Proof is, That the bodies of Mercury and Venus, in their lower conjunctions with the &s;un, are hid behind the &s;un's body, and in the upper conjunctions are &s;een to pa&s;s over the &s;un's body, or di&s;k, in form of a black round &s;pot, which is nece&s;|&s;ary in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, but impo&s;&s;ible in the Ptolemaic.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Though it be impo&s;&s;ible in the Ptolemaic &s;y&s;tem it is nece&s;&s;ary in mine.</P>
<P>15th Rea&s;on and eighth Proof is, That the times, in which the&s;e conjunctions, oppo&s;itions, &s;tations, and retrogradations, of the planets hap|pen,
<PB N="34" REF="41">are not &s;uch as they would be were the earth at re&s;t in its orbit; but preci&s;ely &s;uch as would happen were the earth to move, and all the planets in the periods a&s;&s;igned them; and therefore this, and no other, can be the true &s;y&s;tem of the world.</P>
<P>To this fifteenth Rea&s;on, and la&s;t Proof and po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, I an&s;wer, That, though the times in which the&s;e conjunctions, &amp;c. are not &s;uch as would happen were the earth at re&s;t in her orbit, yet they will happen, and that preci&s;ely, if the centre of gravity be at re&s;t exactly between the poles, and the earth re|volves round it as its centre, and the &s;un like|wi&s;e performs his annual revolution in an or|bit that has this &s;ame centre, and the planets revolve round the &s;un in their orbits, having the &s;un for the centre; and though I will not be &s;o bold and po&s;itive as to &s;ay my &s;y&s;tem is exactly true, without any mixture of error, I will venture to affirm, that it comes nearer the truth than any other that has yet appeared; and that it is the true &s;y&s;tem of the world, I believe no man living is able ju&s;tly to deny.</P>
<P>16th and la&s;t Rea&s;on. But the truth of this &s;y&s;tem has been abundantly confirmed by the accurate ob&s;ervations of the learned Doctor
<PB N="35" REF="42">Bradley; for it plainly appears from thence, that the fixed &s;tars have an apparent motion or aberration, and &s;eem to de&s;cribe &s;mall circles or ellip&s;es, which cold never happen were the earth fixed in the centre, but naturally fol|lows from the motion of the earth's bearing &s;ome proportion to the velocity of light, and con&s;equently the earth really revolves round the &s;un.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this la&s;t Rea&s;on, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have not the credulity to receive the doc|trine of aberration as an article of my creed. The opinion which has been received and confirm|ed by the accurate ob&s;ervations of the learned Doctor appears to me to be founded on conjecture only, therefore no way fit to found an argument to e&s;tabli&s;h the earth's annual motion upon; and, if the whole proce&s;s of the Doctor's accurate ob&s;ervations be fairly examined, I think it will appear to amount to a &s;ufficient proof that the earth is fixed as to annual motion; for, ac|cording to the account given of the ob&s;erva|tions, it is &s;aid that, in the year 1725, when Mr. Mollyneux and Doctor Bradley began to ob&s;erve the bright &s;tar in the head of Draco as it pa&s;&s;ed near the zenith, in order to di&s;cover the parallax of the earth's annual orbit, they,
<PB N="36" REF="43">after repeated ob&s;ervations, found this &s;tar, about the beginning of March 1726, to be 20&Prime; more &s;ougherly than at the time of their fir&s;t ob&s;ervation. It now &s;eemed to have ar|rived at its utmo&s;t limit &s;outhward, becau&s;e, in &s;everal trials made about this time, no &s;en|&s;ible difference was ob&s;erved in its &s;ituation: by the middle of April it appeared to be re|turning back again toward the north; and about the beginning of June it pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame di&s;|tance from the zenith as it had done in De|cember, when it was fir&s;t ob&s;erved: in Septem|ber following it appeared 39&Prime; more northerly than it was in March, ju&s;t the contrary way to what it ought to appear by the annual parallax of the &s;tars.</P>
<P>From which ob&s;ervations I think it will ap|pear, after due inquiry into them, that they all were contrary to what they ought to be, according to the &s;uppo&s;ed annual parallax of the &s;tars; for, by the diurnal motion of the earth, no difference can be made as to their apparent motion ea&s;t or we&s;t; the only appa|rent different appearance would be from north to &s;outh; therefore, when the &s;un is in the equinox, the earth al&s;o, in her &s;uppo&s;ed orbit, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the equinox, &s;o that,
<PB N="37" REF="44">whether the earth be in the ea&s;t or we&s;t part of her orbit, the appearance of the &s;tar would be the &s;ame if the ob&s;ervations were exact, and the greate&s;t difference would appear when the &s;un is in his greate&s;t declination from north to &s;outh. But, according to the account given of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the appearances were re|ver&s;e; for we are told that, by the middle of April, it appeared to return back again, and that about the beginning of June it pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the zenith as it had done in December, when it was fir&s;t ob&s;erved; which, returning back again, I think implies that the &s;ame di&s;tance from the zenith was the &s;ame apparent place in the heavens.</P>
<P>We are further told, that this unexpected phenomenon perplexed the ob&s;ervers very much, and that Mr. Molyneux died before the true cau&s;e was di&s;covered (and, I think I may add, &s;o did Doctor Bradley al&s;o). After this Doctor Bradley, with another in&s;trument more exact and accurately adapted to this purpo&s;e, ob&s;erved the &s;ame appearance not only in that but in many other &s;tars: and by the great re|gularity that appeared in a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations, made in all-parts of the year, the Doctor was fully &s;atisfied with regard to the general laws
<PB N="38" REF="45">of the phenomenon, and therefore endeavoured to find out the cau&s;e of them: he was already convinced that the apparent motion of the &s;tars was not owing to a mutation of the earth's axis. (That mention &s;hould be made of the mutation of the earth's axis on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, by men that think the earth's orbit to &s;ubtend but little more than a point from the di&s;tant &s;tars, appears very &s;trange). The next thing that offered it&s;elf was an alteration in the direction of the plumb-line, with which the in&s;trument was con&s;tantly rectified; but this, upon trial, proved in&s;ufficient: then he had recour&s;e to what refraction might do; but here al&s;o nothing &s;atisfactory occurred: at length, through a mo&s;t amazing &s;agacity, this acute a&s;tronomer conjectured that the phenomenon hitherto mentioned proceeded from the progre&s;|&s;ive motion of light, and the earth's annual motion in its orbit; for the perceived that, if light were propagated in time, the apparent place of an object would not be the &s;ame when the eye is at re&s;t as when it is moving in any other direction than that of the line pa&s;&s;ing through the eye and the object; and that, when the eye is moving in different directions, the apparent place of the object would be different.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46">From all which ob&s;ervations, and experi|ments to find out the phenomenon that &s;o per|plexed the Doctor, and his amazing conjec|ture, it will appear, after a fair trial, that the definitive conclu&s;ion is without &s;upport from rea&s;on; for it is evident, from the tenor of the relation given, that the phenomenon which he wanted to find the cau&s;e of was the irregular apparent motions of the &s;tars; for, had the&s;e motions appeared regular before Mr. Molyneux died, he would have been &s;atisfied, as he made his ob&s;ervation on this principle, that the earth did move in her orbit, and therefore ex|pected to ob&s;erve the object from different points of view, in order to find the annual pa|rallax. Then why all this bu&s;tle about the amazing &s;agacity, &amp;c. to prove what they all knew before, if the earth did move in an or|bit, as they all believed it did? What has the propagation of light, whether in time or in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, &s;eeing it is propagated be|fore the ob&s;ervation can be made, to do in this matter? The whole of this la&s;t amaz|ing di&s;covery appears to be nothing more nor le&s;s than the in&s;tigation of the author of all deceit, to keep men from beholding the truth; and, though it be &s;trange, yet it really is as
<PB N="40" REF="47">true, that we eagerly hold fa&s;t any thing, that has the lea&s;t appearance of an argument, to &s;upport any error we may have once embraced. Now, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;tars are at &s;uch amazing di&s;tances, that the orbit of the earth, which is twice the di&s;tance of the &s;un from it, &s;ubtends no more than a di&s;cernible angle, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, with any degree of truth, that it is the power of man to fix an in&s;trument, by plumb-line, or any other me|thod, twice alike, &s;eeing there is no propor|tion between the length of the in&s;trument and the di&s;tance of the &s;tars? Therefore the lea&s;t imperceptible deviation from exactne&s;s will render the ob&s;ervations uncertain: and this alone appears to be the cau&s;e of the perplexity that attended the ob&s;ervations. I am confi|dent that, if an in&s;trument was &s;o fixed as to behold any one of the fixed &s;tars near the ze|nith, or not, when it is exactly in the meri|dian, and the in&s;trument to remain undi&s;turb|ed the whole year or for ever, the &s;tar would always appear the &s;ame; if &s;o, then there can be no annual parallax, neither does the earth move in an orbit.</P>
<P>I find, in Middleton's Dictionary, under the word &s;tar, that Mr. Whi&s;ton, in his A&s;trono|mical
<PB N="41" REF="48">Lectures (lect. iv.) from the ob&s;ervations of Doctor Hook and Mr. Flam&s;tead, computes, that the greate&s;t annual parallax, or that which a &s;tar in the pole of the ecliptic would have, is 47&Prime;; from whence he finds the di&s;tance of the &s;tars to be about 9000 &s;emi-diameters of the earth's orbit; but that Doctor Bradley, by a &s;eries of accurate ob&s;ervations, has di&s;cover|ed that the parallax does not amount to two &s;econds, therefore the di&s;tances of the &s;tars will be twenty times greater than the forego|ing calculation. Now, from the&s;e different ob&s;ervations, and allowing Doctor Bradley's to be mo&s;t accurate of the two, it may rea&s;on|ably be concluded, that if he had been ex|actly &s;o there would have been no paral|lax; then, con&s;equently, the earth could not move annually in an orbit. Neither is there any rea&s;on to believe that any of the &s;tars are at &s;uch immen&s;ely greater di&s;tances from the earth than the &s;un is; nor that the &s;tars are &s;uns to other &s;y&s;tems, but that they all re|ceive their light from the &s;un; therefore I think from the cleare&s;t rea&s;on, it appears that the Doctor's ob&s;ervation, &amp;c. is not of the lea&s;t force imaginable to effect the &s;tability of the earth, but that it is immoveable as to an|nual motion, and will remain &s;o.</P>

<P>I SHALL now endeavour to &s;hew that the whole heavens and the earth are emblema|tical, and repre&s;ent the incomprehen&s;ible JE|HOVAH&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,&mdash;&s;hin|ing forth in all the glory of &s;overeign grace; on his church, in this world, in the per&s;on of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who is very God and very man, and that Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s who ari&s;es and &s;hines on his church with healing beams of grace, to which the natural &s;un is a mo&s;t glorious emblem; the invi&s;ible poles, between which the earth is &s;upported and enabled to move round in its diurnal motion, to meet and en|joy the enlightening and fructifying influences of that luminary, repre&s;ent to the eye of the mind the invi&s;ible Godhead, the Father and the Holy Spirit. The planets, fixed &s;tars, and
<PB N="43" REF="50">comets, are all emblems of what I may here|after turn my thoughts to. The whole earth is an emblem of the race of mankind, from Adam to the la&s;t of his degenerate offspring, from whom, the great Creator forms a-new his church in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Now, in order to &s;hew the exactne&s;s of the &s;imilitude, I ob&s;erve that the natural &s;un &s;heds abroad his benign influences on the whole earth, but it is not alike benefited, nor produces fruit alike; &s;ome parts of earth are barren de&s;erts, others are wilderne&s;&s;es, habitations of wild bea&s;ts; &s;ome parts mountains, others vales, but few in com|pari&s;on to the re&s;t that are cultivated and productive, &s;uch as plea&s;ant gardens and fruit|ful fields, vineyards, orchards, and the like. As in the natural &s;un all life and light to the whole creation, both animate and inanimate, are trea&s;ured up; the &s;un is the fountain from which all natural ble&s;&s;ings flow. The opera|tive power of the &s;un cau&s;es the clouds to be filled with water, to be carried about in the heavens, and to de&s;cend on the earth to re|pleni&s;h and make it fruitful; fire and hail, &s;now and vapours, &s;tormy winds, &amp;c. all pro|ceed from the agency of the natural &s;un, but always under the control of the Sun of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="44" REF="51">Now, as the earth is nouri&s;hed and made fruitful by the &s;un, yet there is a duty incumbent on man, who is made lord of this world, and for whom it was created, to cul|tivate, by his labour and diligence, the ground, from which all his temporal wants are &s;up|plied; man is to be found in the u&s;e of &s;uch means as are co-operative with the influences of the &s;un, becau&s;e, after the earth was cur&s;ed on account of man's &s;in, the ble&s;&s;ing, as to temporals, is thus, <Q>In the &s;weat of thy face thou &s;halt eat bread;</Q> therefore the earth is to be cultivated by man, el&s;e it will produce na|turally briers, thi&s;tles, and thorns, and other noxious weeds; from whence we may ob&s;erve, that, in tho&s;e countries where the inhabitants do not cultivate the ground, there it brings forth its natural productions, the con&s;equences of the cur&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the benign in|fluences of the &s;un. Now, where the minds of men are willingly employed in the u&s;e of the means, with a full dependance on the ble&s;&s;ings of God, and his providence a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the performance; though in the &s;weat of their face they eat their daily bread, yet are they indued with a calm re&s;ignation to &s;weeten all the labours and cro&s;&s;es they meet
<PB N="45" REF="52">with. There are many among the children of men who are diligent in the cultivation of their ground, or other avocations, be they what they may, and who look not to God for his ble&s;&s;ing on their labours, but think all their pro&s;perity &s;prings from their own indu&s;try; &s;uch, if in misfortune, or any calamities overtake them, not having made God their tru&s;t, but tru&s;ting to their own endeavours, are often driven to de&s;pair, and as frequently come to a mi&s;erable end, and all becau&s;e they did not make God their tru&s;t; for, though man be commanded to be found in the u&s;e of the means, he is not to expect a ble&s;&s;ing from them for any thing that he has done or can do; but as it is the appointed way which God hath pro|mi&s;ed to meet his creature man and ble&s;s him. As it is with re&s;pect to man, and the fruits of the earth whereby he is to &s;ub&s;i&s;t while in this life, that if he be not found in the u&s;e of the means, there is no ble&s;&s;ing attends him, &s;o it is in &s;piritual things with regard to the &s;ouls of men. Does the earth repre&s;ent all mankind, from Adam to the la&s;t of his race; and does the natural &s;un repre&s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the God-man, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hin|ing in his &s;trength, and &s;hedding abroad his
<PB N="46" REF="53">benign influences over the whole world of mankind; then wherefore is it that the greater part of mankind receives no benefit from &s;uch influences? Is it becau&s;e Chri&s;t did not die for them? It does not appear, from the tenor of God's revealed word, that this is the ca&s;e, but rather from their revolting from God, and di&s;regarding his commands. All Nature declares the eternal Godhead, and his attri|butes, and invites all men to wor&s;hip the only living and true God; therefore it is that the apo&s;tle, Rom. i. 18, &amp;c. &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. Be|cau&s;e that which may be known of God is manife&s;t in them: for God hath &s;hewed it unto them. For the invi&s;ible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God|head; &s;o that they are without excu&s;e. Be|cau&s;e that, when they knew God, they glo|rified him not as God, neither were thank|ful; but became vain in their imagina|tions, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkened,</Q> &amp;c. Now it appears according to the &s;imili|tude
<PB N="47" REF="54">between the earth and mankind, that every man who arrives to the u&s;e of rea&s;on, has his allotment to cultivate; that is, the fa|culties of the mind: as the&s;e are managed, &s;o will the production be; if there be a willing mind to attend to the voice of God in the book of Nature and Providence, where the book of revelation has not appeared, God has &s;o revealed him&s;elf to them, that they have walked before him in true faith; witne&s;s Job, his friends, and Elihu: I believe they were all good men, though they had not the book of revelation to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; but where men have the &s;oriptures for their guide and meditate upon them, there they behold the glory of the Divine perfections, and the rich di&s;play of &s;o|vereign grace, manife&s;ted towards &s;inful man in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; therefore, whe|ther we have the &s;criptures or not, there is no excu&s;e for our not improving the talent committed to our care to the glory of God. Now, though the heavens are not &s;o intelli|gible as to declare the doctrine of the Trinity, neverthele&s;s, where the light of revelation comes, in the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;taments, there is a di&s;covery of the mean|ing of the language which the book of Nature
<PB N="48" REF="55">&s;peaks, P&s;alm xix. v. 1&mdash;6; <Q>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma|ment &s;heweth his handy work; day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge: there is no &s;peech nor language where their voice is not heard,</Q> &amp;c. Chri&s;t is the Alpha and Omega, the be|ginning and the end; which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. He is that God which the heavens declare the glory of, and of which the natural &s;un is &s;o &s;trik|ing a figure; for as all temporal ble&s;&s;ings are trea&s;ured up in the natural &s;un, and made ble&s;&s;ings and cur&s;ings to the children of men, according to the righteous judgment of the Son of God, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o is all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing trea&s;ured up in Chri&s;t; and his heavenly influence pervades the whole creation of mankind, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of the race, even as the heat of the natural &s;un pervades the whole earth to its centre. But why is the world of mankind &s;o nearly repre&s;ented by the earth in its different parts? I an&s;wer, be|cau&s;e the cau&s;es being &s;imilar the effects will be the &s;ame. The earth and the heavens al&s;o were made for man; and when he was formed out of the du&s;t of the earth, and God had breathed
<PB N="49" REF="56">into him the breath of life, and he became a living &s;oul, there was a living body al&s;o: the &s;oul and body being united, the one part be|ing &s;piritual, the other temporal, each requir|ed different nouri&s;hment for their &s;upport; the &s;piritual required &s;piritual, the temporal tem|poral food; therefore the Lord God planted a garden and put man therein, that he might there enjoy the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure: while he was &s;atisfying his &s;oul with the abundant glory of God, which appeared wherever he ca&s;t his eyes, and that the tabernacle of clay in which the &s;oul was lodged might be &s;upported, there were abundant &s;upplies from the fruits of the earth to &s;atisfy every de&s;ire; but he, being thus in honour, continued not in rectitude, but, through the deceitfulne&s;s of the devil, &s;inned again&s;t God, and was ca&s;t out of this garden; God therefore, in the riches of his grace and covenant love, had provided a Sa|viour, and did not ca&s;t him utterly away, as the ju&s;t reward of his &s;in, nor fully execute the &s;entence denounced again&s;t him for breaking his law, but granted him a reprieve; and, to the confu&s;ion of Satan, offered life and &s;alva|tion to him, in the &s;ame words that were part of the &s;erpent's cur&s;e, which was&mdash;the promi&s;ed
<PB N="50" REF="57">Saviour&mdash;the &s;eed of the woman that was to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. Now man being dead as to law, that is, under &s;entence of condemnation, the promi&s;e of life and &s;alva|tion was made to Adam, and in him to all his race, who &s;hould believe in this promi&s;ed Saviour; and, from a &s;en&s;e of their being in a &s;tate of condemnation for &s;in, and liable to fall into eternal mi&s;ery as its ju&s;t reward, tho&s;e who endeavoured to flee from the wrath to come by willingly embracing this Saviour in the arms of faith, and, from a &s;en&s;e of the infinite love of God, gave up them&s;elves, body and &s;oul, unto God to be guided by his coun|&s;el, and protected by his power from the &s;nares and a&s;&s;aults of Satan, their grand adver&s;ary, &s;hould be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; but &s;uch as di&s;regarded this promi&s;ed Saviour, and rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them|&s;elves, by li&s;tening to the &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan, &s;hould peri&s;h in the way of their own chu&s;|ing. Since life and death are clearly &s;et be|fore them, this being now a &s;tate of probation; and being ca&s;t out Eden, and the ground cur&s;ed for their &s;akes, that is, for their &s;in, the earth in this cur&s;ed &s;tate will produce nothing that is plea&s;ant and good for food without
<PB N="51" REF="58">our labour and toil. Before &s;in entered the world the Lord God planted a garden for man, and he had nothing to do but to enjoy the fruits he was permitted to eat; but now man is to dig and plant, and to grub up the weeds, and labour to prevent the earth from bringing forth its natural produce, which is the effect of the cur&s;e. Yet how have the generations of mankind acted with re&s;pect to the command God enjoined them to keep? have they ob&s;erved it &s;o as to cultivate the earth, and rid it of tho&s;e briers and thorns, and wild bea&s;ts and venomous creatures, &s;o obnoxious to man? &s;urely no; for, from the earlie&s;t ac|counts we have of mankind, they have, through the in&s;tigation of the devil, for&s;aken the commands and coun&s;els of God, and have followed after repine and murder. None be|ing content with that which God in his pro|vidence had given them, and having for&s;aken him, he left them to follow the dictates of their own corrupted hearts and imaginations as a puni&s;hment; therefore, in&s;tead of clear|ing and cultivating the land, as they increa&s;ed, they became enemies to one another, and, leaving the art of hu&s;bandry, &s;trove to excel in the art of war; whereby wilderne&s;&s;es, &amp;c.
<PB N="52" REF="59">increa&s;ed, as the earth was depopulated of its inhabitants; for, if the inhabitants of the earth, that is, the children of men in general, had followed the dictates of the law of God written on their hearts, they would have been peaceable, have lived in harmony, and en|deavoured to promote the welfare of each other, and not, from the perverted notion of honour, have become one another's de&s;troyers. This has always been the ca&s;e, more or le&s;s in all ages, and is the melancholy pro&s;pect in many places at this time, which is the rea&s;on &s;o great a part of the earth is uncultivated.</P>
<P>Thus it is that the wa&s;te and wilderne&s;s lands, that &s;hould be fore the &s;upport of the tempo|ral welfare of mankind, are &s;imilar to the world of mankind with re&s;pect to their &s;piri|tual welfare. The &s;oul of man being &s;piritual, requires continual &s;upplies of food for its nou|ri&s;hment and growth, and if it be not fed with that which is &s;piritual it will decay and die; that is, become carnal, &s;en&s;ual, de|vili&s;h. Now, though all mankind by nature are in a &s;tate of condemnation, they are not delivered up to the power of Satan, but are left to their own will to chu&s;e life, by believ|ing in the promi&s;es of God, and laying hold

In the beginning when God creat|ed the heavens and the earth, and man from the du&s;t of the earth, and had breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a liv|ing &s;oul, the Scriptures inform us, (and the information is con&s;onant with rea&s;on) that <Q>in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God; and without him was not any thing made that was made,</Q> John i. 1&mdash;3. and &s;ome following ver&s;es: and in Colo&s;&s;ians i. 16. it is &s;aid <Q>For by him, that is, the Son of God, were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible; whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities or powers, all things were created by him and for him.</Q>&mdash;Now as all things are created by him, and for him, does it not appear, that as the Eter|nal JEHOVAH in the everla&s;ting covenant, ac|cording to the coun&s;el of his own will, decreed to create man, and from him and his po&s;terity to rai&s;e a church, and unite that church to him&s;elf, by making the &s;econd per&s;on in the undivided
<PB N="56" REF="63">Trinity to be the head of it, to redeem it from the mi&s;erable &s;tate into which it had been permitted to fall through the deceit|fulne&s;s of Satan? I &s;ay, does it not appear, as all things were made by him, and for him, that he would make his church one with him|&s;elf, and that he made all things, whether in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, for the benefit and &s;upport of the &s;ouls and bodies of the world of mankind out of whom that church was to be formed? I think that rea&s;on will acknowledge this; and that there|fore the infinite love of God to mankind was richly di&s;played beyond the conceptions of mortals, in that, before man was created, there was &s;uch provi&s;ion made for his temporal and eternal welfare. After man had fallen by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion into &s;in and mi&s;ery, and a pro|mi&s;e made of pardon and reconciliation to God in the &s;eed of the woman to Adam, and in him and to all his race, that &s;hould put their tru&s;t in this promi&s;ed Saviour, he and his wife, being the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, were made the fir&s;t recipients of this grace, by be|lieving the promi&s;e; they &s;aw Chri&s;t's day and rejoiced; on this promi&s;e they lived, and found &s;upport again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of Satan. As their family increa&s;ed, and were capable to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="57" REF="64">there is no doubt but they taught their children to know that they were in a lo&s;t un|done &s;tate by nature, and the manner how they became &s;o; that it was on account of their &s;in that they had rendered them&s;elves ob|noxious to the wrath of the holy and righte|ous God of heaven and earth. But that God had provided and promi&s;ed a Saviour; that who&s;oever of them put their tru&s;t in God, through this promi&s;ed Saviour, and oppo&s;ed all the a&s;&s;aults of the devil, in his various attacks, by faith looking continually to him for aid, &s;hould come off conquerors; but tho&s;e that forgot God and their Saviour would, through the deceitfulne&s;s of Satan, (that &s;ame devil that deceived them, and cau&s;ed them to believe his lies, and to &s;in again&s;t God) be led cap|tives at his will, and &s;o become enemies to God by wicked works; and thereby bring in|finite mi&s;eries into this world, and make them|&s;elves eternally mi&s;erable in the world to come. And that there was no way to become happy in this world or the next, but by obey|ing the Almighty, and looking continually up to him for &s;trength, that they might be able to re&s;i&s;t the devil in his various and continued a&s;&s;aults. And then, no doubt, that they might
<PB N="58" REF="65">impre&s;s their minds with a due &s;en&s;e of the Maje&s;ty of the Mo&s;t High God, who&s;e crea|tures they were, and who&s;e love and obe|dience he demanded, they &s;hewed unto them the glory of his power, and goodne&s;s in, as it appears, the works of Creation and Providence. The&s;e truths were handed down from gene|ration to generation by tradition, by the few that walked in the fear of God, until it plea&s;ed God to reveal his will to his cho&s;en people by Mo&s;es and the prophets. The Scriptures declare Chri&s;t to be God, and likewi&s;e that the heavens declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s. Chri&s;t is emphatically called in the&s;e the Sun of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; and in P&s;alm lxxxix. v. 36. where the P&s;almi&s;t is &s;peaking of Chri&s;t as the &s;eed of David, <Q>that he &s;hould endure for ever, and his throne as the &s;un before God;</Q> and the prophet Jeremiah, c. xxxi. v. 35. &s;ays, when &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, <Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord, which giveth the &s;un for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the &s;tars for light by night;</Q> and many other Scrip|tures &s;hew that the natural &s;un is an em|blem of Chri&s;t, that the moon is an emblem of the moral law, the Chri&s;tian's rule of life; and that the fixed &s;tars are emblems of the
<PB N="59" REF="66">&s;aints in glory, who, whil&s;t here on earth, &s;hone as lights in a holy life and conver&s;ation. Tho&s;e, when in the world, were careful for food for the &s;oul, the inward man, not altogether care|ful for the clay tenements in which they dwelt, and therefore an&s;wered the end of their creation; but tho&s;e who neglected to feed their &s;ouls on the rich provi&s;ion which, in &s;uch abundance, was &s;pread before them in the books of Nature, Providence, and Revelation, became as it were twice dead, being dead by nature, that is, being in a &s;tate of condemna|tion by the law, and being in a &s;tate of pro|bation, refu&s;ing life, and in the error of their way, rejecting the coun&s;el of God, and wil|lingly following the coun&s;el of Satan, they confirmed the &s;entence by aggravated crimes, &s;ome more than others, becau&s;e they &s;inned again&s;t more light; therefore it is that our Lord &s;aid to tho&s;e that &s;aw his mighty works, and either maliciou&s;ly or carele&s;sly rejected him and his go&s;pel, <Q>That it would be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for &s;uch,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, &s;eeing that there is &s;uch abundance of food for the &s;ouls of men to fea&s;t on, how in|excu&s;able
<PB N="60" REF="67">will all &s;uch be, who refu&s;e tho&s;e dainties, and turn a&s;ide to the &s;en&s;ual delights of the fle&s;hly mind, whereby the &s;oul, being &s;tarved to death for want of &s;u&s;tenance, and being dead as to &s;pirituals, becomes not only &s;en&s;ual, but devili&s;h, therefore many degrees below the lowe&s;t of the brute creation; as to the exact proportion, how much lower man by &s;in is &s;unk below the brute, I will not &s;ay; it &s;eems as difficult to explain, as it is for men to find the di&s;tance of the fixed &s;tars from the earth. But as no de&s;cription of mankind, as to natural abilities and gifts, whether mental or external, are forbidden to take of the rich bounties which infinite goodne&s;s has &s;et before them, and that all are invited to partake there|of in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, as manife&s;tly ap|pears to every rational mind that has the veil of darkne&s;s removed from off it: &s;o no de|&s;cription of mankind, as to gifts, &amp;c. are ex|empt from the temptations and &s;nares of the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil; therefore it is that, for the greater part of tho&s;e who are partakers of the greate&s;t temporal ble&s;&s;ings and mental gifts, they, being off their guard, fall under the temptations that be&s;et them; then
<PB N="61" REF="68">pride, which rules all the corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, blinds the minds, and hurries the will to pur|&s;ue whatever evil Satan pre&s;ents; for &s;o it is written, <Q>Not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, not many mighty, not many noble, are call|ed;</Q> that is, as I conceive, who an&s;wer and are obedient to the call, they being &s;o im|mer&s;ed in the &s;inful cares and plea&s;ures of time and &s;en&s;e, that, <Q>having ears they hear not, and eyes they &s;ee not,</Q> and therefore obey not the voice that from every quarter calls them to life and immortality; and this is that which cau&s;ed the P&s;almi&s;t to &s;ay, <Q>They &s;et their mouth again&s;t the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth,</Q> &amp;c. that is, bid God defiance, and will not hearken to his voice; and, as a ju&s;t reward of their &s;in, it is further &s;aid, <Q>thou did&s;t &s;et them in &s;lippery places,</Q>&mdash;all degrees of mankind are &s;ur|rounded with &s;nares and temptations, and, for want of watchfulne&s;s, are made captives to &s;in and Satan; but mo&s;t frequently where the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of a temporal nature are gi|ven, &s;uch is the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in in the hearts of men, that, in&s;tead of their having a due effect in drawing their hearts to God in gratitude and love, the order of Nature is in|verted,
<PB N="62" REF="69">and man becomes an enemy to him. How many in&s;tances have we recorded of men, almo&s;t in every age, of the mo&s;t exalted parts, as to natural endowments, who have di&s;co|vered in their general conduct the ba&s;e&s;t of principles; &s;ome who have been great orators, and have been intru&s;ted in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tations, who have proved in the end to be the greate&s;t enemies to the public welfare, and from the ba&s;e&s;t motives publicly oppo&s;|ing both fal&s;ehood and truth? In oppo&s;ing fal&s;ehood they have &s;ucceeded much: accord|ing to the old adage <Q>&s;et a thief to catch a thief,</Q> they knew how others &s;hould act, and were capable of di&s;covering wherein they had acted wrong; and therefore, in order to prove them guilty of mi&s;management, or &s;ome criminal offence, that they might turn them out of office, and them&s;elves get in, no mat|ter how they turned them out, if their necks were broken by the fall, &s;o that their own ends were an&s;wered. In order to accompli&s;h this de&s;ign, they made u&s;e of all the powers of eloquence in &s;upport of truth and ju&s;tice, that a &s;tranger, when hearing them, would really think they were friends to what they profe&s;s; and their arguments were of &s;uch
<PB N="63" REF="70">force that they frequently brought over others to their opinions; from which they &s;o won upon the minds of the unwary, that, having acted as they thought with &s;incerity, they put confidence in them, and con&s;ented to their be|ing put into office; but ere long they were di&s;covered not worthy to fill &s;uch &s;tations, were turned out again, and their places filled with worthy characters, who had the public welfare at heart, and acted according to truth and ju&s;tice as far as their power and abilities enabled them. Notwith&s;tanding their adher|ence to true patrioti&s;m, they too met with as much oppo&s;ition from their oppo&s;ers, who, though men of great abilities, were not a&s;ham|ed to oppo&s;e truth any more than fal&s;ehood. Thus have they acted in public life, and in private have lived in all manner of debauchery, &s;educing the unwary, e&s;pecially youth; and thus it has been in different ages. If there be any &s;uch in the pre&s;ent age, may the Almighty convince them of their &s;hameful error, and deliver them from the&s;e &s;tronger than iron bands wherewith they are bound, and cau&s;e them to loathe the &s;ordid tra&s;h on which they have hitherto been feeding, and to delight in &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial food, &s;uch as is contained
<PB N="64" REF="71">in the books of creation, providence, and re|velation! the holy meditation in which is the only nouri&s;hment the &s;ouls of men can re|ceive.</P>
<P>I think Dr. Young, in his Night Thoughts, page 103, de&s;cribes &s;uch characters as tho&s;e before mentioned in the mo&s;t beautiful manner:
<Q><L>Heart-merit wanting, mount we ne'er &s;o high,</L>
<L>Our height is but the gibbet of our name,</L>
<L>A celebrated wretch when I behold.&mdash;</L>
<L>When I behold a genius bright and ba&s;e,</L>
<L>Of tow'ring talents, and terre&s;trial aims,</L>
<L>Methinks I &s;ee, as thrown from her high &s;phere,</L>
<L>The glorious fragments of a &s;oul immortal,</L>
<L>With rubbi&s;h mixt and glitt'ring in the du&s;t.</L>
<L>Struck at the &s;plendid, melancholy &s;ight,</L>
<L>At once compa&s;&s;ion &s;oft, and envy, ri&s;e.&mdash;</L>
<L>But wherefore envy? Talents angel bright,</L>
<L>If wanting worth, are &s;hining in&s;truments</L>
<L>In fal&s;e ambition's hand to fini&s;h faults</L>
<L>Illu&s;trious, and give infamy renown.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>From a con&s;ideration of the&s;e lamentable realities it becomes every human being to pau&s;e, and con&s;ider how it is with him&s;elf; whether he was ever fed with real food, &s;uch as nouri&s;hes the &s;oul to eternal life; and tho&s;e who have fed, and often have had &s;weet re|pa&s;t, find that they &s;tand in need of conti|nual &s;upplies; for as the body grows weak and
<PB N="65" REF="72">faint, for want of continued nouri&s;hment, &s;o does the &s;oul likewi&s;e. Meditation on the per|fections of God, prayer and prai&s;es to God for his goodne&s;s, are the duties of the children of men; and in the&s;e duties they are always a&s;|&s;i&s;ted: though it may be &s;ometimes not &s;en|&s;ibly, &s;till they improve while in the way of duty. From the neglect of being found in &s;uch practices, the P&s;almi&s;t in &s;uch pa|thetic language, exclaimed, <Q>O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s, an for his wonderful works to the children of men.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>How often do we find in the Scriptures that the heavens, the earth, and the &s;eas, the &s;un, the moon, and the &s;tars, are called upon to celebrate the prai&s;es of the infinite, incom|prehen&s;ible Jehovah, in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, particularly in P&s;alm cxlviii. In what manner is it to be under&s;tood that inanimate creatures are to prai&s;e the Lord? I conceive thus; That it is a call to mankind to li&s;ten carefully to the &s;ilent, but powerful and &s;weet prai&s;es they are continually declaring of God. The &s;ongs of prai&s;e which they &s;ing, though &s;ilent to the &s;en&s;ual ear, are loud and melo|dious to the ear of the &s;oul when truly awaken|ed;
<PB N="66" REF="73">they are &s;ongs expre&s;&s;ive of the infinite love of God to the returning children of the rebellious race of man. They &s;ing many &s;ongs of prai&s;e to the Lord; they &s;ing of mercy and of judgments; they &s;ing of the Lord's waiting to be gracious; of his patience, of his long|&s;uffering, and forbearance; in a word, they &s;ing of all the perfections of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed God in Trinity.</P>
<P>I would again ob&s;erve, that as the earth is fixed as to annual motion, the changing &s;ea|&s;ons of the year proceed from the &s;un's an|nual revolution round the earth, and the earth's diurnal motion is the cau&s;e of day and night. The laws that govern the motions of the &s;un and the earth are not to be found in any of the courts of men, but remain with God; and they move according to his will, and not by any innate power of their own; &s;o likewi&s;e man, in his fallen &s;tate, is no more able to move towards God than the earth has power of it&s;elf to move from the foundation on which it is fixed, which rea&s;onably appears to be the centre of gravity, and what in the Scriptures is &s;aid to be <HI>nothing</HI> on which the earth hangeth. Therefore man is taught in the Scriptures to know, that by nature he is in a lo&s;t and mi&s;er|able
<PB N="67" REF="74">&s;tate, and liable to eternal death and mi|&s;ery; and that it is in God alone, through Chri&s;t his Saviour, that he can be rai&s;ed from his low and mi&s;erable &s;tate; for it is God that worketh in man both to will and to do, and that of his own good plea&s;ure&mdash;and woe be to tho&s;e who are left to their own will, who do not believe in Chri&s;t, nor flee to him for re|fuge; for, as it has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome good men, if our fir&s;t parents, when in innocence, were foiled by Satan, how can any of their race expect to &s;tand again&s;t him in their own &s;trength, who have none, having lo&s;t all by &s;in?</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to &s;hew the real benefit that will ari&s;e from a proper &s;tudy of the heavenly bodies; and I hope the&s;e few hints will not prove in vain. As the heavens are a large field for &s;peculation, &s;o, if they are &s;tudied in con&s;ort with the Scriptures, they will be a &s;ource of con&s;olation al&s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to prove, that the book of Providence declares the &s;ame truths as the Scrip|tures do, with re&s;pect to the Divinity of Chri&s;t; that it witne&s;&s;eth to the truth of the Scriptures in the &s;tronge&s;t manner that can be expre&s;&s;ed. As all men, (except tho&s;e darling mortals that
<PB N="68" REF="75">deny the being of God) acknowledge that God rules and governs the world, both in mercy and judgment. Now, as the Scriptures declare Chri&s;t to be God, that he created all things, and that without him was not any thing made that was made, they al&s;o declare that the promi&s;es and threatenings therein contained are the promi&s;es and threatenings of God in Trinity, and that to Chri&s;t, as God, all power was given by the Father. The Scriptures be|ing &s;o clear and full to prove the doctrine of the Trinity, Satan has &s;o far prevailed as to blind the minds of thou&s;ands by his wiles, who therefore deny them to be the word of God, as revealed to his &s;ervants the prophets, &amp;c. Now as God declared his threatenings to men on account of their di&s;obedience, and they paid no regard to them, and judgment took place both as to time and manner in the deluge of the whole world, when the whole race of man, except Noah and his family, were de&s;troyed in the&s;e re&s;pects, the Scriptures were exactly fulfilled; for it is written, that man's days &s;hall be an hundred and twenty years; and &s;o as to manner. The flood came and &s;wept them all away; but before this threatened vengeance took place, the long|&s;uffering
<PB N="69" REF="76">of God appeared ina&s;much as repent|ance towards God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was preached unto them while Noah was preparing the ark, 1 Peter c. iii. v. 19, 20. and c. iv. v. 6. Is not the next fulfilment of this threatening a full proof that the Scriptures are the word of God; the &s;e|cond per&s;on in the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity? Again, as to the promi&s;es made to Abraham and to his &s;eed: the exact time of his offspring being in Egypt, and their deliverance; their travels in the wilderne&s;s; the promi&s;es and threaten|ings by the mouth of Mo&s;es; their exact ful|filment in the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and their captivity; their return from captivity, ac|cording to the word of God; al&s;o as to the judgments denounced again&s;t Babylon, and the enemies of the church, and their fulfilment; the promi&s;es and prophe&s;ies of Chri&s;t the Me&s;|&s;iah, and their fulfilment, and likewi&s;e the fulfilment of the prophecies of the Old Te&s;|tament, which have taken place, re&s;pecting the church and her enemies in go&s;pel times; all the&s;e are undeniable proofs that the Scrip|tures are the word of God, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the God of Providence. And the numerous appearance of Chri&s;t as the God of
<PB N="70" REF="77">Providence to his church and people in every country where his name was profe&s;&s;ed and relied on, e&s;pecially in Great Britain, is manife&s;t to any per&s;on who con&s;ults his hi&s;|tory. There are many, it may be many thou&s;ands, who will not believe the truth of the Scriptures with re&s;pect to the univer&s;al de|luge of the earth; whereas there is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of its authenticity to be found in mo&s;t parts of the world, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places where the &s;oil is of a &s;andy gravelly nature, and near rivers, where the rapidity of the waters were &s;o great, that as they &s;ub&s;ided they made channels, by carrying the earth before or with them, thereby cau&s;ing eddies, which rai&s;ed tho&s;e little hills that in many places remain nearly the &s;ame as they are near Woolwich, where, in digging for &s;and, there are different &s;trata before they reach it, one of which is mud and &s;hells; the&s;e &s;trata appear to the cleare&s;t view to be the &s;ediment of the waters that were thus agitated when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and which cau&s;ed great quantities of &s;hell-fi&s;h, the waters at the bottom of the &s;ea being di&s;|turbed, to be thrown upon land:&mdash;and I have been told that &s;hells are to be found on the
<PB N="71" REF="78">Blue Mountains at Jamaica. Thus this aw|ful judgment has left a faithful te&s;timony to the world of the truth of God's word, and that it was inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;inned again&s;t the mercy of God in Chri&s;t, the God of the world, by who&s;e word this judgment was de|nounced.</P>
<P>Similar to this awful judgment denounced in the Old Te&s;tament, and awfully fulfilled by the God of Providence, is that mentioned in the New by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, where he pre|dicts the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and the di&s;|per&s;ion of the Jews, for their rejection of the Son of God, the true Me&s;&s;iah, of whom the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament te&s;tified.&mdash; Did not the judgment take place? Was not Jeru&s;alem de&s;troyed? Were not the Jews di&s;per&s;ed? Are they not to this day a &s;cat|tered people throughout the habitable parts of the earth more or le&s;s? And are they not, like the fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, in a kind of &s;trata, di&s;tinct from all the re&s;t of mankind, and will remain &s;o until the accompli&s;hment of the prophecies con|tained in the Scriptures concerning them? Now, from the nature of things, which carry their own evidence with them, to prove their reali|ties, the truths concerning them are e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="72" REF="79">and will remain &s;o, notwith&s;tanding there may be men, blinded by the cunning crafti|ne&s;s of Satan, who will deny the truth, not|with&s;tanding it is &s;upported with &s;uch &s;trong evidence; for, what &s;tronger proof can be re|quired than that the Scriptures are of Divine origin; that they were revealed to mankind by the Spirit of God; that the Godhead is a Trinity in Unity; and that all power, both in heaven, earth, and hell, is committed unto the &s;econd per&s;on in the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, who conde&s;cended to take upon him our na|ture, and thereby became God and man in one per&s;on? And this one per&s;on, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God, is the God of Providence, and governs the world, and declares his mind and will in his holy word, and brings all things to pa&s;s in his providence which he has de|clared to do in his word. All which will con|found the daring wretch who dares deny his eternal powers and Godhead, and the truth of his holy word, which he hath conde&s;cend|ed to lay before mankind, in &s;uch a clear point of view, that all his works in nature, providence, and grace, point directly to him. &mdash;But though there were multitudes of unbe|lievers who heard the threatenings denounced
<PB N="73" REF="80">by the Almighty from the mouth of his &s;er|vants, their unbelief did not prevent the judg|ment from being executed; &s;o neither will the unbelief of men now, who reject the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves, that coun&s;el which is contained in the book of Nature, Providence, and Revelation&mdash;prevent the due execution of all threatenings denounced in God's mo&s;t holy word again&s;t all impenitent &s;inners.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the fo&s;&s;il &s;hells that are found buried a great depth in the earth make an ex|cellent manure, e&s;pecially in cold clayed lands: &mdash;from which I would ob&s;erve, that a due con&s;ideration of the&s;e two remaining marks of God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e de&s;pi&s;ers of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, will prove an excellent ma|nure to cold and clayey minds, and will con|duce much to &s;trengthen the belief of the Di|vine origin of the Scriptures.&mdash;Can a per&s;on behold the&s;e &s;hells as they lie in the &s;trata be|fore they are removed from the place, and con&s;ider them, without being led to the cau&s;e of their coming there? When we read the awful account of the flood, and its cau&s;e, does not the &s;ight of the&s;e &s;hells confirm the report the Scriptures give?&mdash;Again, when we read in the Scriptures that the children of I&s;rael for
<PB N="74" REF="81">their &s;ins again&s;t the God of their fathers, in rejecting him, were threatened to be rejected al&s;o, and &s;cattered over the whole earth, and that the Gentiles &s;hould embrace the Saviour whom they refu&s;ed, and all the ages before the events &s;poken of took place&mdash;can we then behold the Jews, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tance, as di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of mankind through|out the earth, although they dwell in the mid&s;t of cities or people, yet without a government of their own, and not be convinced of the truth of the Scriptures in this peculiar mark of God's dealing in his providence with his people? How does a due con&s;ideration of the&s;e things confirm and &s;trengthen the faith of the real Chri&s;tian in the truths they con|tain?</P>
<P>Thus I have, according to my weak abili|ties, endeavoured to evince the harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the&s;e three books, which God, in his infinite goodne&s;s, has be&s;towed upon mankind, in order that they, by duly reading in, and contemplating on, the one great &s;ub|ject contained in all of them, may be taught and prevailed on to turn unto Him from whom, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they have revolted. The &s;tyle that the&s;e books are written in dif|fers
<PB N="75" REF="82">from all others; for though it be the mo&s;t grand and lofty, yet at the &s;ame time is the mo&s;t plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by the meek and humble; yea, even wayfaring men, though fools, may read and under&s;tand abundantly the Author's meaning in tho&s;e my&s;terious things, to which many parts relate, whereby they be|come truly wi&s;e, and enjoy much &s;olid peace and comfort in the hope of their being admit|ed into the pre&s;ence of that God who wrought &s;uch wonders for them&mdash;while men of the greate&s;t natural parts and learning, who live as without God in the world, &s;eeking their own glory and not his, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the &s;urface, and not caring to dive into the true meaning, remain often &s;trangers to the Divine truths recorded in the&s;e &s;acred volumes.</P>

<P><HI>The following ob&s;ervation having &s;truck my thoughts after this work was in the pre&s;s, let it be read after the period at the bottom of the 38th page:</HI></P>
<P>How the earth's motion bearing &s;ome proportion to the velocity of light is compatible with the belief that the orbit of the earth &s;ubtends from the di&s;tance of the &s;tars (an angle not quite two &s;econd,) let rea&s;on judge: if it be con&s;idered that the bright &s;tar in the head of Draco is &s;ituated nearly on that meridian which is 90&deg; from each equinoctial point, the di&s;tance of the &s;tar at each ob&s;er|vation mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame; therefore, Dr. Bradley's amazing &s;agacity was nothing more than an amazing mi&s;|take.&mdash;With regard to any fixed &s;tar that is in the equinox, and the earth in her &s;uppo&s;ed orbit is in the equinox al&s;o, and diametrically oppo&s;ite to the &s;tar; if this &s;tar were ob|&s;erved at both &s;ea&s;ons when the earth is in the different equinoctial point, it would appear &s;trange if the &s;tar did not appear in the &s;ame point of view as the two equinoc|tial points, and the &s;tars are all in one direct line.&mdash;More might be offered, but if the&s;e ob&s;ervations are duly weighed, I tru&s;t enough is &s;aid.</P>
